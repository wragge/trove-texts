POEMS BY OSGAR WILDE
REQUIESCAT.
Tread lightly, she is near.
Under the snow ;
Speak gently, she can hear
The daisies grow.
All her bright golden hair,
Tarnished with rust,
She that was young and fair,
Fallen to dust.
Lily-like, white as snow,
She hardly knew
She was a woman,''so
Sweetly she grew.
Cofiin-board, heavy stone,
Lie on her breast;
I vex my heart alone :
She is at rest.
Peace, peace, she cannot hear
Lyre or sonnet;
All my life’s buried here,
Heap earth upon it.
HELAS.'
To drift with every passion till my soul
Is a stringed lute, on which all winds can play.
Is it for this that I have given away
Mine ancient wisdom, and austere control?
Methinks my life is a twice-written scroll,
Scrawled over on some boyish holiday,
With idle songs for pipe and virelay,
Which do but mar the secret of the whole.
Surely there was a time I might have trod
The sunlit heights, and from life’s dissonance
Struck one clear chord to reach the ears of God :
Is that time dead ? lo ! with a little rod
I did but touch the honey of romance—
And must I lose a soul’s inheritance?
WILDES PLAYS.
HE four plays of Oscar Wilde are now
available in two volumes, published
by J. W. Luce and 00., Boston (155.).
Wil&e’s charming impertinence, his
plethora of frequently machine-made epi-
gram, his polished style, are apt to shadow
his very real gifts as a playwright. A
perusal of these four plays, which were pro-
duced within a space of three years, conveys
the impression that Wilde wrote them with
the unconscious facility of genius The
first, Lady Windeniere’s Fan, is technically
as perfect as An Ideal Husband ; there is no
evidence that Wilde either retrograded or
progressed In his stage technique. He did not
have, like Jones and *PinerO, painfully to
learn how to write for the theatre ; his work
never suffered from stage-fright. His sphere
of action was necessarily a limited one ; he
deals exclusively with the idle and useless
group of “ society ” into which it was his
misfortune to be born ; but within that
limited compass his genius found room for a
complete self-revelation. It was a curious
trivial world that this modern Congreve so
delightfully painted, a little artificially-
lighted stage of conventions, and manners,
and here and there—morals, sharply
separated from the great world outside—a
world that he regarded merely as the,.butt of
his brilliant wit, a world that included, for
instance, humorous and absurd things like
servants, the lower classes, and Australia.
Wilde got much fun out of Australia. Take
these fragments of dialogue between the
Duchess of Berwick and Mr. Hopper, the
rich young Australian, whose father, as the
Duchess remarks, “ made a great fortune by
selling ..some kind of food in circular tins—
most palatable, I believe—l fancy it is t(*e
thing the servants always refuse to eat.”
'Hopper : Capital place, London ! They are
not nearly so exclusive in London as they are in
Sydney.
Duchess of Berwick : Ah ! We know your
value. Mr. Hopper. We wish there were more
like you. It would make life so much easier. Do
you know, Mr. Hopper, dear Agatha and I are so
much interested in Australia. It must he so
pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying
about. Agatha has found it on the map. What
a curious shape it is ! Just like a large packing
case. However, it is a very young country
isn’t it?... J
Duchess : Mr. Hopper ! James ! Agatha has
told me everything. How cleverly you have both
kept your secret.
Hopper : You don’t mind my taking Agatha,
off to Australia, then, Duchess?
Duchess: (in lignantly) To Australia? Oh
don’t mention that dreadful vulgar place. . . I
think on the whole that Grosvenor Square would
be a more healthy place to reside in. There are
lots of vulgar people live in Grosvenor Square,
but at any rate there are no horrid kangaroos
crawling about. . . You’ll come to lunch, of course,
James. At half-past one instead of two. The
Duke will wish to say a few words to you, I
am sure. . .
Hopper : I should like to have a chat with the
Duke, Duehess. He has not said a single word to
me yet.
Duchess: I think you’ll find he will have a
great deal to say to you to-morrow.
it/
Though Wilde remained, like the true
artist, static in the centre of his succeeding
creations, in the manner of his stage-direc-
tions—a literary and not a theatric quality—
he shows some development. Thus his lirst
play begins baldly :—“ Lady Windermere is
at table R. Arranging roses in a blue bowl.”
But by the time Wilde writes An Ideal
Husband he is sufficiently in love with his
characters to vignette them in this dainty
fashion as they appear
“ Mabel Chiltern is a perfect example of the
type of prettiness, the. apple-blossom
type. She haS all the fragrance and freedom of
a flower. ... She has the fascinating tyranny of
youth, and the astonishing courage of innocence.
She is really like a Tanagfa statuette, and
would be rather annoyed if she were told so.”
Of Mrs. Cheveley he remarks, “ She looks rather
like an orchid, and makes great demands on one’s
curiosity. A work of art, on the whole, but
showing the influence of too many schools.” And
of Sir Robert Chiltern : “ One feels that he is con-
scious of the success he has made in life... There is
nervousness in the nostrils, and in the pale, thin,
pointed hands. It would be inaccurate to call
him picturesque. Picturesqueness cannot survive
the House of Commons. But Vandyke would
have liked to have painted his head.”
And, finally, here are a few pickings from
Wilde’s riotous efflorescence of epigram :
IF “There are many different kinds of women,
aren’t there ? ”
“ Only two kinds in society : the plain and the
colored.”
IF Every woman is a rebel, and usually in wild
revolt against herself.
IF You should study the Peerage, Gerald. It is
the one book a young man about town should
know thoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction
the English have ever done.
IF London is too full of fogs and—serious people.
Whether the fogs produce the serious people, or
whether the serious people produce the fogs, I
don’t know, but the whole thing rather gets on
my nerves.
IF I thought I had no heart. I find I have, and
a heart doesn't suit me. Somehow it doesn’t go
with modern dress. It makes one look old.
IF Repentance is quite out of date. And besides,
. if a woman really repents, she has to go to a bad
dressmaker ; otherwise no one believes in her.
IF “Ah! the world was made for men and not
for women.”
“Oh, don’t say that. We haVe a much better
time thairthey havq. There are far more things
forbidden to us that are forbidden to them.”
IF The English country gentleman galloping after
a fox—the unspeakable in full pursuit of the un-
eatable.
IF “ But don’t the people to whom you owe the
money give you a great, great deal of annoy-
ance?”
“Oh, 10, they write ; I don’t.” -
IF Twenty years of romance makes a woman look
like a ruin ; but twenty years of marriage make
her something like a public building.
IF “The Book of Life begins with a man and a
woman in a garden.”
“ It ends with Revelations.”
IF “We are only going to look at the stars.”
“You will find a great many, dear—a great
many.”
. IF “ All women become like their mothers. That
is their tragedy.”
“No man does. That is his.”
♦
The following verses, which have a merit of
their own, are also invested with tragic associ-
ation. Henry Kendall’s connection with J. Lionel
Michael, as clerk in the latter’s office at Grafton,
adds an interest to these verses, found on Michael’s
table on the same day that Michael’s body was
taken from the Clarence River at Grafton.
Applied art —hitherto a lone stranger in Aus-
tralia—has for the past fortnight had a home in
Sydney. A little company of art workers fitted
up and decorated a room with furniture of purely
Australian design and manufacture. Misses
EireneMort, Dagmur idoss, and their co-workers
have seized upon the artistic basis for design in
the unique forms of Australian flora, and in fur-
niture, wood-carvings, stencilled curtains, metal
and leather work, the guild has produced some
admirable flesigns. The toys, in the form of
cheap, rough unbreakable models of Australian
animals, should especially appeal to Australian
babyhood. Some samples of the charming art of
binding books were quite commendable—a copy of
Paterson’s verse in calf-skin, still with its hair in,
seems especially and humorously appropriate. The
guild should prosper.
What songs were they the sirens sung?
What name Was that Achilles bore -
When young and fair, the maids among,
A maiden’s dresS and mien he wore ?
I cannot .tell, yet thought is free,
Some guess, perchance, might answer Well ;
B it after death what we shall be,
All! that, indeed, I cannot tell.
Who lived as I have had to live,
Misjudged by all, without a friend,
Will little feel the alternative—
To die, to die, and there an end.
Ah me ! it is not death we fear
When griefs are more than we can bear,
But if we are not happy here,
Who knows ? We may be quiet there.
Truly, my trial has been sore.
In sorrow here I woke and slept,
And held a face of calm before
The world, that guessed hot I had wept.
And yet, sometimes, somehow, I know
There would lie mercy yet for me ; -
Man will have done for me below,
My Father, I will go to Thee.
J. LIONEL MIGHAEL (1865).
A CONGLOMERATE.
Heavily hobbled with six pages of preface and
a page of errata, E. J. Rupert Atkinson’s Regusus
confidently limps into the home-paddock of the
“ Red Rage.” The pamphlet is titled At the Shrine
of Desire (Melville and -Mullen, Mel b., 2s. 6d). lii
his preface, written “ for the sake of perspicuity,”
E.J.R.A. tells us that his verses are a selection
from three years’ brooding upon the question of
immortality. For a while (we shudderingly
learn) Materialism almost succeeded in cl.utching
him to her heart; but/- —m a heavy paragraph—he
triumphantly tore himself from Haeckel. " Here,
however, is no place for metaphysics,’ and “lan-
guage is but a conglomeration of words.” H.s
broodings have led him, however, to certain fixed
and flawless conclusions—among which we may
possibly rank the curious futility of corsets.
“Is it not well,” he exclaims, “to see the
swarming earth red with crime, lust and disease,
to see the mad labors of men and their no less
mad extravagances, and to see their women-folk
tightly-corseted, empty headed, futile, grasping,
vain and aggressive, gorgeous with their bar-
barous hats ancLgowns—the products of sweated
years of toil ? The woman that uses her body as
a clothes-rack is as a brake upon the progress of
the world, but even she, in company with the
aristocracy, the luxurious, the idle-rich, with
their fellows the convicted, fulfil their ends and
in some way justify tlieir existence.” E.J.R.A.,
modestly disclaims all personal experience of
the verses curtained off m the section en-
titled Fantasies—imd hopefully, but baffled,
we turn to the forbidden door. “We have
all of us so much of the animal in us
that our innate savagery insists upon utterance
—I hold that the endeavor to give voice to such a
feeling, to revile someone,-to rage or to curse, in
verse more or less musical and dramatic, is less
discreditable and more economical than to let the
feeling rankle and go to waste.” At this point he
finds that “enough has been said to explain the
nature of these verses.. . . For myself. I believe
all things, or believe I do;. . . These pages con-
tain much that I believe, .more that I do not
believe.” Which throws a doubt upon the
economic virtue of the woman that uses her body
as a clothes-rack and the economy of cursing.
It is evident that Mr. Atkinson is very young.
If he isn’t, it is quite time he was. Yet, amid his
sonnets to Monism and his rondeaux to the Great
God, here and there, we may pick out from this
turgid conglomerate stanzas as interesting as
these :
Having seen her loveliness, I am well pleased
To know she is divine, and further lore
Seek not henceforth, since hope is here appeased,
Yet knowing she is sweet I know no more.
Sweets of the garden, surely she has breathed
The scent into your petals, surely she
Has woken you to beauty bequeathed
Thereby some fruit of hey divinity !
• I am dissolved within my love for her
Even as in fragrance of a rose
My soul has oft times passed, or with the stir
And throb of music, sought and found repose.
So shall I live forever, seeing she
Herself can never fail, and I a part.
Therefrom, of her sweet self will ever be
At least a memory to her holy heart.
V*/
I look abroad : a myriad love as I;
k myriad have my thoughts, perchance they
dream
To think they may become, before they die.
What I would seem.
Is this nt> thought to sicken me ? Is this
Not horror past all horror here to see
Each man’s lust be my own, my passion his ?
. . . Life stifles me !
The earth is dank with mouldering grass and leaf;
Each sound is as an echo caught before ;
And I am as an echo to my grief
And nothing more.
Both sea and land are black with irk and feud,
I hear the wailing winds, the soughing tides.
The brooding soul of voiceless solitude
Alone, abides.
’ W
I shall not care if the Abyss
Torture my soul if I may share
Her whole heart’s love ; and after this
I shall not care.
If I may know that I am where
The heaven of her presence is
I still cart smile. . . . I still can dare. . . .
Or if I voice in the Abyss .
The agony of my despair,
And hear my wails of cowardice,
I shall not care.

George ; Lambert’s three scholarship pictures
now hang together in. the Sydney Art Gallery.
Lambert has travelled a long way from the bril-
' liance of his “Across the Black Soil Plains ” to
these low-keyed conscientious portrait studies.
The two works that have just arrived show an
immense improvement in technique over his first
rather labored effort. “The Three Kimonos”
depicts three young women in Eastern garb, with
rather fantastically posed hands. The Eques-
trian Portrait of a Boy ’’—the artist’s son—though
decorati.vely conceived and solidly painted, lacks
interest from the inanimation of the faces of the
little red-jacketed rider and of theservant-maid who
holds the pony. Lambert’s aim is now eminently
decorative, his scheme of coloring severely re-
strained, his god evidently Velasquez. His work,
a kind new to the Gallery, interests by its con-
viction and -its rough strength. The artist, who
has been macjle an Associate of the International
Society, interids exhibiting a number of portraits—
in which direction apparently his strength lies—
at a new portrait show, to be held in London in
January. This show should, in the artistic sense,
“place” him for the English critics.
In Studio sketches (Galleon Press, Brunswick)
William Moore gossips of things artistic in Mel-
bourne in an interesting manner. The volume
commemorates the foundation, fifty years ago, of
the first Art Society in Victoria. A history of
the beginnings of art in the southern a
biographical note of the interesting personality o
the convict sculptor, William Stanford, th
designer and constructor of the Stanford fountai
in Spring-street. Melb., are useful contribution
to tiie story of Australian art. The many repr
sentative illustrations by Melb. artists are admi
ably reproduced.
Jack London’s Before Adam , in Kreryhodp
Magazine, grows m interest. His picture of life
in the mid-Pleistocene period is vivid and scient
fically plausible. Of man’s relationship t
the animals in that epoch, London writes:
“We were not fighters like them ; we wer
cunning and cowardly, and it was because of
our cunning and cowardice, and our inqrdinat
capacity for fear, that we survived in that fright
fully hostile environment of the Younge
World. . . It never entered anybody’s head t
weave a basket out of willow-withes. Possibly it
ten or twenty generations we might have workec
up to the weaving of baskets. And in this connec
tion, onethingis sure; if once we had woven withe
into baskets, the next and inevitable step woulc
have been the weaving of cloth. Clothes woulc
have followed, and with covering our nakednes
would have come modesty. .. . We were jus
getting started, and we couid.not go far in aping!
generation. We were without weapons, withou';
fire, and in the raw beginnings of speech.”
G. B. Lancaster, author qf A Spur to Smite , i
rapidly mastering the art of the short story. Th
sheer merits and reserved strength of her work
have now gained her admittance into the jealously
guarded circle of Harper's. In the curren;
number of that magazine prominence is given
her admirable Australian story, The Brand of th
Wild. The Maoriland writer’s progress will re
pay consideration.
Pertinently suggested in America that Roose
velt, whose name is pronounced in three syllables
of which the first does not rhyme with “booze,’
but with “pose,” might begin his spelling reform
at home by cutting out the superfluous am
misleading “o,” and signing himself plain
“Rosevelt.”
The Dean of Westminster is, de facto, the lite
rary censor of England. It is his sanction tha
applicants for a place in the Poets’Corner mus
obtain. He has just allowed the name of Eliza
both Barrett Browning to be inscribed at the foot
of her husband’s grave in the Abbey. Meanwhile
Herbert Spenser waits philosophically outside.
Dot and the Kangaroo (Artgus & Robertson
makes a welcome reappearance with six illustra
tions by Frank P. Mahoney. Every Australian
child should have Ethel C. Pedley’s charming
animal story of our own continent.
Meteorologist Clement L. Wragge publishes his
notes, admirably illustrated, of a stay in New
Caledonia and Tahiti under the title of The
Romance of the South Seas. (Chatto and Windus.)
There was more romance in some of Wragge’s
isobaric charts.
For a lazy summer day down by the sea the
reader'might do worse than take along The Girl
at Blue Creek, by George Checklev (Southern
Press Agency, Melb.). It is a collection of
Australian sketches that, if not literature, are
true to life, ana, if not of absorbing interest, are
graphic and eminently readable. The book is
generously illustrated by Laurie Tayler.
In countries such as England, where Nature is
sufficiently tame to be made a pet of, the nature-
lover abounds, and for his delight there are
published many books. In this continent Nature
is often too near and too hostile for us to study
her features with loving care. In Glimpses of
Australian Bird Life iff. C. Lothian, Melb., Is.),
Robert Hall, F.C.S., who has already done good
work in Australian nature studies, bids for the
popular taste with a collection of admirably
reproduced original photographs of bird-life from
nature; The notes might have been a little more
informative.
The Blessed John Vignney, Cure d’ Ars, Patron
of Parish Priests, by Joseph Vianney (Duck-
worth, Lond.), is a work about which it is unneces-
sary to express an opinion. That has already
been done by a person of the name of Henricus
G. S. Bowden, Censor deputatus, who, opposite
the title page, remarks Nihil ohstat, which
apparently means that Henricus sees no valid
objection to the book. Another person of
the name of Gulielmus informs us, also in Latin,
that the book may be printed. After these
official encomiums there is no need to append
anything except the observation that we, too,
think it may be printed, and, like the Censor
deputatus , we don’t think it matters much, any-
\Hew.
Details are given by “E.W.D.” of Kipling's
borrowed line mentioned by “ R.D.” Rev. Win.
Allmi, in his Centennial Cantata (Melb., 1888),
wrote : ■ 1
Where the warrigal whimpered and bayed.
Where the feet of the dark hunter strayed,
Seethe wealth of the world is arrayed.
Kipling, in The Seven Seas (Lond., 189 G), borrows
thus for “ A Song of the English ” :
Song of the Dead in the South, in the sun by our skeleton
horses,
Where the warrigal whimpers and bays, through the
dust of the sere river-courses.

“NEW RIVAL”
LOADED SHOTGUN CARTRIDGES
The “New Rival” is a grand good cartridge ;
good in construction, good because it is
primed with a quick and sure primer, and
good because carefully and accurately
loaded with the best brands of powder
and shot. It is a favorite among hunters
and other users of black powder cartridges
on account of its uniform shooting, evenness
of pattern and strength to withstand
reloading. A trial will prove its excellence.

VARIOUS VERSE
From a Drama of Old Venice.
Oh ! the poppy and the wheat,
And the bread men bake with fire !
Oh ! the poppy and the wheat,
And a country maiden sweet —
The bread of man and all a man s desire !
A foe to cross my sword,
A friend to take my word,
A bank of cyclamen whereon to dine—
With one fond woman and a flask of wine !
A friend, a girl, a foe !
Nor heaven nor earth below,
Can more than these to any man afford !
VIC.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
Going Blind.
Is this the end of every hope,
Of all the plans I made,
To shut mine eyes and sadly grope
Through life in gloom arrayed ?
No more to see the shining stars,
No more to see the sun ;
My cry goes up to Heaven’s bars :
“ What have I done ? ”
No more to see the holy flowers,
The violet and the rose ;
No more to see the Spring’s glad showers —
The joy of living goes !
No more to see the face of Love,
Of my most-treasured one !
O ! hear my cry, thou God above :
“ What have I done ? ”
No more to see her shining eyes,
No more to see her face ;
No more with her to see the skies,
The far blue realms of space.
I may not view these lovely things,
Then all my race is run ;
I cry to Thee, 0 King of Kings :
“ What have I done ? ”
What sins are mine, that through the years
I mournfully must creep,
Nor see the blazing midnight spheres
Reflected in the deep ?
Nor see the birds, nor see the bees,
Nor see sweet children run ;
I cry atnid my miseries :
“ What have I done?”
All blotted out from my poor sight,
And mournful dirges roll;
I crawl o’er plains of endless Night,
And blackn.ess fills my soul,
And tears of blood flow from mine eyes—
Poor eyes sweet Sight doth shun ;
I ask Thee, God, with bitter sighs :
“ What have I done ? ”
VIO.
GRANT HERVEY.
Burton.
He sang the “Sword” you know; or, rather
wrote it,
Read, fought, explored; translated certain books,
Some to be thumbed ; some others barely
quoted—
Passed to retirement; his last loving looks
Were lost in Desert-dream, mirage that floated
Mid-ether o’er hot sands, with trickling brooks,
Cascades, and domes of pearl, of Moslem palaces
And other Oriental air-born fallacies.
])i e d_ye3 t in Italy, a death serener
Than falls to most brave fellows of his stamp ;
There, bathed in Eastern lore, his sight grown
keener,
Arose before his couch a Bedouin camp,
Black tents, green banner and oasis greener,
Beyond a sandy dune’s slow-rising ramp
As, swaying sadly on in close grey column,
A caravan fared past at paces solemn.
And ever, as it sailed tow’rd the Unknown,
That fleet of “ desert-ships” with stars above
And moon whose Moslem crescent all outshone,
He, anxious, listened on, with desert-love
Soul filled, and caught the falling, rising tone
Of camel-bells mid-air ; clear chimes that rove
Those seas of billowy sand, and oft’nest nightly
When summer’s hottest, and the moon shines
brightly.
The world knew long ago his last request—
“ Ah ! lay me in my tent within the sound
Of camel-bells, to soothe me where I rest
And dream the mighty Desert rings me round ;
’Neath yon proud dome whose blue be ever blest,
From zenith-point to far horizon’s bound ”
Wish that his wife, whose love for him was
passion,
Performed with all her soul in pious fashion.
To-day the marble tent, with sculptured folds,
And camel-bells from far within it swinging,
Two bodies hearsed in marble, all it holds—
The breeze that enters sets those bells a-ringing,
Whose wild chimes, welling o’er the grassy wolds,
Stay children passing by and sweetly singing,
Who turn to see, and wonder as they listen
To hear those bells, and see the marble glisten.
There rest the dead explorer and his lady,
For she, in turn, at her loved warrior’s side,
Sleeps in the very tent for which he prayed ; he
Prayed also it might one day shield his bride.
A-slumber yet, brave pair in alcove shady
Their cool retreat, a master-artist’s pride.
I wonder, when the evening breeze is winging
Its way in, do they hear those sweet bells ringing ?

AUSTRALIA SPEAKS.
Reidism has been routed ; the Deakin policy of
“New Protection” has been affirmed; N.S. Wales
has come from out its sulky corner and joined
with the other States to work for the good of
Australia ; the Labor party has been taught
that only its moderate counsels and wise leaders
are acceptable to the Commonwealth. Those
messages can be distilled from the clamor of
the election results. Australia had in but
few cases a candidate voicing all the national
aspirations, and was prevented from giving
an unmistakeable verdict on issues which, in
some cases, were not even presented and in
others were sorely confused. But, considering
the circumstances, the voice of the people has
spoken with wonderful clearness.
* * * •
REiD-ism has been routed. That was, after all,
the most obvious and pressing duty. It was the
sanitary task of the electors—the clearing out of
the rubbish as a preliminary to setting the house
of Australia in order. The cause which represents
shameless office-seeking, a mean appeal to old-
world sectarian animosities, and a blind
antagonism to the aspirations of Australian
nationalism, has been decisively defeated. There
is hardly a Reid party left in the House of Repre-
sentatives. From N.S. Wales, and N.S. Wales
alone, Mr. Reid drew his faithful support in the
last Parliament. In the new Parliament N.S.
Wales will be anti-Rioio. At the 1903 elections,
of 26 N.S.W. seats the Deakin party won 4,
the Labor party 7, and the Reid party 15. At
the 1906 elections, of 27 seats the Deakin party
won 5, the Labor party 11, and the Reid party 11.
It is useless for Mr. Reid’s press supporters to
seek comfort from the fact* that in Victoria,
Queensland and Tasmania there have been some
“ Anti-Socialist” victories, for the successful men
there cannot be with any surety classed as Reid-
ites. In Victoria, for example, every candidate
but one emphatically repudiated Reid, and M ‘Cay
and Allan M'Lean, the two men who were his
colleagues in a Ministry, were both rejected, M'CaY
most decisively. The position then in the House
of Representatives is that G. Reid can reckon
with certainty on 11 N.S.W. supporters and may
glean three or four, or even five, more from the
other States. In the Senate’ his position is
stronger. For want of any serious opposition he
still holds the block N.S.W. representation, and
will probably find a few new sympathisers from
the other States.
* » * *
That the Deakin party let the case go by
default in most of the States was one of the
serious mistakes of the campaign. It has led to the
curious position that, whilst the Deakin platform-
affirming that the completion of a policy of “New
Protection ” is the first task of the new Parliament
—has been almost everywhere endorsed, the direct
Deakin party comes back weaker than before.
Deakin candidates wherever they appeared polled
extraordinarily well, with the single, and quite
deserved, exception of Senator Playford. In
New South Wales no sitting Ministerialist was
seriously threatened, and the solitary new
candidate carrying the Deakin banner scored
a victory. In Queensland there was but one
Deakin candidate, and his victory was most
decisive. In Victoria and Tasmania, wherever
the Ministry was adequately represented,
its man won. The triumph of Crouch over
M‘Cay —both members of last Parliament, both
well-known, with the personal advantage all on
the side of M‘Cay, but with Crouch following
Deakin and M‘Cay sympathising with Reid—
was a significant test of the opinion of the Austra-
lian electorate. But Deakin candidates were
absent from most constituencies. Lack of
organisation in some cases was responsible,
in N.S. Wales to this was added the selfish-
ness of the Labor organisations. But, apart
from the misfortunes of his followers, the
Deakin policy has scored an emphatic triumph.
Not a single avowed Freetrader has been returned
as such, and a suspicion of sympathy with Free-
trade always acted as a serious handicap even to
Labor candidates. That Australia wants the
New Protection, and at once, is as clearly
announced as that it does not want Reid.
* * • •
On national grounds, there is nothing in the
election results half so gratifying as the
conversion of N.S. Wales from its old attitude
of aloofness, which the election results show.
The “ mother State ” has, from the first, posed as
the sulky child of the Federation, nursing a griev-
ance, whining over a wrong, insisting on standing
in the path of Australian aspirations. It was the
one State to break faith over the Federal Enabling
Act; the one State to delay union and necessitate
a second referendum; the one State to demand at
the point of the sword a special bribe in the shape
of the Federal capital before it would promise to
be good ; the one State, when an Australian Parlia-
ment was summoned, to be in perpetual opposition.
Allthatisnowover. ItendswithßEiD-ism.foritwas
nothing more nor less than RsiD-ism. The mists
of a narrow colonialism, the dark traditions of
a dark period of Australian history fade away,
and N.S.W. shows that it is willing to be Aus-
tralian. In the last House the N.S.W. represen-
tatives of Protection and Labor combined were a
minority compared with the Reid group of Anti-
Federalists. In the new House they outnumber
and overshadow the remnant of that caucus of
reactionaries.
# * * #
Perhaps the most useful of the admonishing
voices of the elections is that addressed to the
Labor party. The figures in the various States
convey a wholesome series of lessons to that organ-
isation, upon which, clearly, the future fate of
Australia rests. In N.S. Wales, where the per-
sonal influence of Watson and Hughes was felt,
and the eminently sane and reasonable Worker
represents the party in the press, the Labor party
scored a series of remarkable triumphs. It
entered the contest with five seats. It comes out
with eleven, and in East Sydney it almost dis-
placed G. Reid, and in the Hunter and Dailey
only failed to win, with candidates hurriedly put
in the field, by the narrowest of margins.
Clearly, the electors want Laborism of the brand
advocated by Watson and the N.S. Wales
Worker. Quite another story has to be told of
Queensland. There Labor went into the contest
holding practically all the seats and comes out
shattered and beaten. Even such a ster-
ling man as Higgs loses his Senatorship. In
Queensland Labor has come to be identified
with the wildly intransigeant policy of the
Brisbane Worker, and the leagues which follow
its beck. It is a policy which calls for “ Socialism
in our time,” which knows nothing of sweet
reasonableness, which persists in identifying
the Labor movement with totally irrelevant
theological discussions. The surest condemna-
tion of this policy is in the fact that its pursuit
is steadily driving Kidston, who is of the
Labor ranks, and who, without a doubt, wishes
to be a Democratic Premier, into the arms of the
Tories. The people’s opinion of it is shown in the
disasters which have overwhelmed the Laborites
in Queensland. They are innocent sufferers
mostly, having had little or nothing to do with
the causes which made for their destruction.
That entitles them to sympathy, and will pro-
bably stimulate them to set to work to cure the
conditions which have proved so disastrous. In
Victoria, simiarlly, where the Labor party took up
an attitude of treacherous antagonism to the
Democratic Protectionist who supported the Wat-
son Ministry, Labor scores no gratifying victory.
In every case where a Labonte faced a Democratic
Protectionist he was defeated; even Randolph
Bedford, with all his gifts of oratory, could not
displace Hume Cook. Australia wants Laborites
of the Watson brand; but not of the Queensland
Worker or Victorian Political Labor League
brand.
* * * *
The party position as left by the electors is that
Deakin commands about a third of the Parlia-
ment, Watson about a third. Opposed to that
two-thirds —which is almost homogeneous in
sympathies—is what may be termed, with or
without offence, a motley gathering. There is
the Reid remnant. There is a remnant of the
Allan M‘Lean half of the Reid-M‘Lean coali-
tion, which repudiates Reid, but has some sym-
pathy with his anti-Laborism. There is a body
of indefinites who cannot be classed until the divi-
sion bells begin to ring, but who sympathise with
the Deakin party on most points, but are opposed
to what they call Labor domination. The
obvious solution in 1906, as in 1903, is a Deakin-
Watson alliance sharing power and responsi-
bility. To that there are many obstacles which
patience and diplomacy may—and if the Labor
leagues have read aright the lessons of the elec-
tions—will surely clear away.
* * * *
In fine, Australia, on December 12, was asked
many questions in a hurried and breathless way.
There were many confusing noises abroad. A
fat person breathed stertorous warnings about
Socialism. Flurried females of the Fido-kissing
variety shrieked or purred about the purity of
the home. Narrow sectaries whispered ominously
about the nefarious plans of Home. Raging
enthusiasts clamored fiercely for the moon, and,
until they had the moon, objected to any dis-
cussion about anything else. All this helped
nothing to a sensible and wise conclusion. Still,
the answer given is fairly satisfactory. At least
REiD-ism is routed.
A WESTRALIAN SECESSIONIST NAMED
“FLICK.”
The Bulletin has received at different times
various letters from Westralia in which vague
remarks were made about the shocking wrongs
done by the Commonwealth to that State. In
each case it has asked for particulars, and at last
one Secesh person, signing himself “Flick,” has
responded. He is absolutely the only one who
has done so. This is “Flick’s” case :
Your reply (8., 8/11/’O6) duly noted, and in reference
thereto, permit me to make a rejoinder or two. Cer-
tainly, I have not personally ascertained the views of the
majority re secession, but I have sufficient horse-sense to
know that the secession movement is no myth. Should
you care to make inquiries, y u will discover that the
goldfields people are becoming disgusted with the policy
of grab adopted by the legislators of the East. You must
be well aware that the goldtielders’ main reason for enter-
ing Federation was the prospect of the early construction
of the transcontinental railway. ‘Now that the Coolgar-
die-Esperance line will, for a certainty, be constructed
within a couple of years, the goldfielders appear to have
turned rather cold on the “silken thread” business.
And small blame to them.
You say I can find no genuine grievance. Can’t I,
just 1 How about the manufacturing industries in the
East ? Victoria has had her industries nursed for over 20
years by a sound Protective policy. How can we com-
pete with her? Must we be content to be the dumping-
ground, and say nothing? Look at it from a business
point of view, apart from sentiment, and give me a direct
answer. Sentiment is all very well, especially when it
Says, but it does not pay us, and therefore we have no
me for it.
If we were not a good milch cow for the Eastern States
they would not be so anxious to retain us.
Again, the proposal to take over our debts—and our
revenue—sounds very nice until analysed. We, who pay
about twice as much as any of the other States, would
receive, of our own, equally with the others. We pay
(say) £B. Each other State turns in £4, making £2B
altogether. On the Federal basis of division we would
get back £3 10s. per capita, the same as each other State.
Were we not in Federation, the other States would turn
in £2O, and be refunded £3 per head of population.
We would have our £B. Splendid idea for the Eastern
States, is it not?
No, sir, it does not suit our pockets. Severed from the
alleged politicians of the East, we could work out our
own destiny, and become the most prosperous adjunct to
the Australian nation by protecting our industries and
building up manufactories—a task rendered impossible
under existing circumstances. We would also be in a
position to contribute more than a fair share to the pro-
vision and upkeep of an Australian navy. Then, in per-
haps 20 years, under a protective policy, we might be
able to enter Federation without sacrificing our interests,
as we are undoubtedly doing at present.
* * * *
The Bulletin feels inclined to make a few
remarks in reply :
(1) It may be that the W.A. Goldfields entered the
Commonwealth in the hope of getting the Adelaide-Perth
railway completed at the expense of the Commonwealth
—that is to say, largely at the cost of Queensland,
N.S.W., Victoria, and Tasmania. These States pay for
their own railways, and Westralia, no doubt, expects
them to pay most of the cost of its line also. And The
Bulletin holds that they should do so—that the Wes-
tralian transcontinental line, and also the transcontinen-
tal line to Port Darwin, should be built by the Common-
wealth as works absolutely necessary for defence. But
still, Westralia didn’t stipulate in the Constitution for its
transcontinental line, so it has no real grievance
because it didn’t get it on the instant. As a cause
for secession the proposition is absurd. The Common-
wealth must build the line some day to defend its
territory. If Westralia broke away, then the Common-
wealth needn’t build the line at all, and wouldn’t.
Meanwhile Westralia hasn’t even secured S.A.’s consent to
the construction of the railway, and nothing can be done
without that. And when the House of Reps., in which
the Eastern States are strong enough to run the show,
passed the Westralian Railway Survey Bill cheerfully, the
measure was lost in the Senate because a certain
Westralian Senator wouldn’t take the trouble to be there.
Westralia should elect Senators who will attend better
to its business.
* * • *
(2) The next grievance of “Flick " is that Westralia
joined the Commonwealth under a Constitution which
expressly provided for Freetrade inside the Federal
territories, and “Flick” denounces the Eastern States
because Westralia has got what it agreed to have.
“Flick” also seems to hold that this thing Westralia
agreed to have, and which it got, is a greater wrong to
Westralia than to Queensland or Tasmania or N.S. Wales
though they are all on the same footing. As to the
alleged damage to Westralian industry through Westralia
getting what it agreed upon, here are the latest available
figures as to the number of hands employed in manu-
factures compared with those employed in 1900—the last
year before Federation :
Hands Employed in Factories.
Latest Increase
1900. Returns. about
Westralia „ 10,320 13,614 32 per cent.
Victoria .. 64,207 80,235 25
N.S.W. .. 60,779 72,175 18 „
S. A. .. 17,659 20,049 14
Queensland 26,904 21,705 20 percent.
It seems that if Westralia were Queensland it might
really have something to grumble at; as it is it appears
that its long-stagnant industries only really began to
grow after Federation arrived. As for “ Flick’s ” State
being swamped by the goods of the Eastern States,
Westralian imports were less, and Westralia was being
swamped by less outside goods in 1905 than in 1896.
Perhaps it now gets more Australian and less foreign
goods, but the aggregate swamping is not as large as it
was nine years ago. Perhaps “ Flick’s ” real grievance is
his fear that his State may be helping the industries of
Australia rather than those of Germany or Belgium.
(3) The next complaint is that “ if we were not a good
milch cow the Eastern States would not be so anxious to
retain us." If “Flick,” possibly judging others by him-
self, holds that there is no such thing in the world as
patriotism, and that no one cares for Australia save for
what he can get or steal out of it, he is welcome to his
miserable opinion. Perhaps, if it were a case of English-
men trying to keep England from falling apart, he might
credit them with motives that were not utterly sordid,
but as it is only Australians trying to hold Australia
together, “ Flick ” can see none but the basest reasons
for their action.
* • * •
(4) And then “ Flick ” goes into vague outcries about
an imaginary wrongful division of the surplus which
never happened, and which no Federal politician of any
note has even suggested. He seems to have a wild idea
that the Federal surplus es divided, or is going to be
divided, among the States on such a principle that the
Westralian whoputsin £Bisonlytogetbackasmuchasthe
Easterner who merely puts in £4 (“ Flick’s ” figures are
hideously wrong, but that is no matter). It might be
as well to wait till this wrong happens, or is seriously
suggested, before seceshing over it.
(5) As a side issue of the case—the large amount which
Westralia pays to the Commonwealth (and gets back in
the division of the surplus) represents duties on the
State’s immense foreign imports. Westralia’s excise
returns are nothing extraordinary ; its postal and tele-
graph returns are not much ahead of those of Queens-
land ; and its imports from Victoria and N.S.W. and
the other States pay no duty. Therefore, the mere
existence of the huge revenue that “ Flick ” brags about
throws serious doubt upon the alleged swamping of the
Westralian market by Victorian goods, about which
“ Flick "—the same old identical “ Flick "—makes such
complaint.
• • • •
(6) Further it may interest “ Flick ” to know that his
State has been living to some little extent on its despised
Eastern neighbors instead of them upon it. The “new
expenditure” of the Commonwealth is charged to the
Commonwealth as a whole—not apportioned out among
the States according to their contributions. And
Westralia required, in proportion to its population, far
more new expenditure to bring its services even partially
up to date than any of its neighbors, therefore these
neighbors have been paying part of Westralia’s bill. It
is a small item, but “ Flick ” might be glad to hear of it.
• * • *
In a general way, the theory about a horrid con-
spiracy on the part of “the other States” to rob
and oppress “our State” arises from plain bump-
tiousness. It is based (1) on the idea that “our
State ” is the only honest one in the lot, and that
the wicked will naturally conspire against it, and
(2) on the idea that “our State” is the only one
with any money, and that hungry pirates like
“ the other States” will naturally want to take it
down; and both these ideas have their root in
huge self-importance. A section of the people of
N.S.W. have the self-important disease badly
because their State has the largest population,
was the first one lagged—that is, settled —and has
the biggest revenue. A seotion of the people of
Westralia have the complaint just as badly
because their State is the biggest in point of area
and has also the largest gold boom. The State
Frights party in N.S.W. is just as positive as the
corresponding party in Westralia, that the policy
and existence of the Commonwealth, and what it
does, and what it leaves undone, and its rising up
and its sitting down, and its going out and its
coming in, are all new evidences of a desire to
rob “our State.” And therein they resemble
Dickens’ Mrs. Snagsby, who felt that the world
revolved round her little household, and that all
the contents of the globe were evidence, more or
less direct, of a desire on the part of humanity to
deprive her of her rightful property, which was
Mr. Snagsby.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Inter-State Shipping Conditions.
It is a misfortune that in the first big case to
come before the Federal Arbitration Court, in
relation to officers’ wages on inter-State vessels,
Justice O’Connor should have adopted a wrong
datum point from - which to lay out his award.
Especially in the matter of wages, he said, the
soundest basis was to take the conditions on deep-
sea voyages, making certain allowances for local
conditions. His Honor found, going on that
basis, that Australian masters were paid too little,
while officers, especially those of lower rank than
chief-officer, were already paid very well. But,
at the best, what was the good of taking a
basis when the whole justice, or injustice,
of the decision depended upon the extent of
the departures which admittedly ought to be
made from it ? J ustice O’Connor himself showed
at another stage how utterly wrong it was to take
deep-sea voyages and conditions into account at
all. The officers had claimed that, as they held
pilotage-exempt certificates, the companies should
make them some allowance on account of the
saved fees. But the Judge would not hear of it.
“It would be impossible,” he said, “ to carry on
the inter-State and coastal steam service if it were
necessary to employ a pilot. .. . When the
master performed exempt pilotage duties on
special occasions, as in the case of a P. and O.
master taking his ship in and out of Syd-
ney, he might fairly be allowed some
special fee.” That throws light upon the vast
difference between service on deep-sea and inter-
state boats. On the latter the vessel is practi-
cally in danger all the time it is out of port, and
it is in port 10 times oftener than the average
deep-sea vessel. All the officers of inter-State
and coastal boats have, therefore, to share re-
sponsibities and to undertake work which the
j unior officers of deep-sea steamers either know
nothing at all about, or bear only at long intervals.
Moreover, if the earnings of men on deep-
sea vessels are to come into the matter
as a basis, why not also the earnings
of the owners ? The deep-sea owners may
say, “We pay all that we can afford.
We know it isn’t enough, and we would
willingly pay twice as much if we could afford it.”
Besides writing down the value of its fleet by
£IOO,OOO, in the past two years the best known of
the inter-State companies has made an annual
profit of 17 per cent. The big deep-sea steam-
ship cos. rarely pay more than 3| per cent. What
the deep-sea owners pay is, therefore, beside the
question. The point is that Australia pays dearly
enough in passenger fares and freights to allow
its companies to pay its officers well, and they
don’t do it. It therefore does not get the service
to which it is entitled, and the chances are
that it will get still poorer service in the
future. Mr. Justice O’Connor had the oppor-
tunity to alter that; he had the opportunity
to make the service one which would attract and
hold the best men —men in whose hands life would
be trusted with confidence —and, blundering on
the threshold, he tripped and missed the chance.
It is hardly surprising, then, that in most respects
the award is unsatisfactory. Certainly some relief
has been granted in the matter of working hours,
through regulations, adopted as between the parties,
which have been embodied in the award. If they
are observed, it will not often happen hereafter that
an officer, utterly fagged out with a long spell at
discharging cargo, will be entrusted with the
safety of ship and all on board. The weak
point is that the good regulations may be
suspended at any time by the master “for the
preservation of the cargo or any part thereof.”
So to save a few bunches of bananas, they may
still play dice with the lives of a shipload of
passengers. As affecting masters, a doubtful
feature of the award is one which makes them
entitled first to an extra £1 per month and later
to an extra £2 per month as they grow old in a
service. It is a dangerous provision—it will pro-
bably mean that the master will not be permitted
to grow old in a service. And, finally, one
other curious feature of the remarks with which
Justice O’Connor introduced his unsatisfactory
award calls for wonder. Officers complained that
their quarters were, innumerous cases, lumped with
the latrines. Said his Honor: “The chairman of
the Shipowners’ Association had assured him in
evidence that defects in accommodation in some
of the older vessels would be remedied. He
accepted that assura.nce.” The Bulletin respect-
fully submits that his Honor isn’t there to accept
assurances, but to make awards. If he believed
that certain changes were necessary—and ap-
parently they were necessary—then his duty in
the matter seems to have been sufficiently obvious.


The Bank that Sosh Built.
On the day when almost all the Tory papers in
Australia had the usual something to say about the
financial smash that would follow if the country
didn’t vote against the “Socialistic” policy
of land-tax and monopoly-breaking, they printed
a telegram from Maoriland concerning the Bank
of New Zealand. When in 1894 that bank bailed
up the Government and threatened to shut up if
000,000. were not handed over, an arrangement
was come to by which the most hopeless-looking
assets were transferred to a Board for realisation.
Already the anti-Socialistic borrow and boom
policy of Vogel and others had resulted in such
disaster, that four years earlier £625,000 had been
written off reserves and £600,000 off capital to pro-
vide for losses and depreciation. Maoriland had,
however, been reduced to such a state of semi-
bankruptcy that, even after this provision had been
made, it was estimated by the then President of
the bank that, on the £2,680,285 of assets taken
over by the Board for realisation, there would be
a deficiency of £850,000. After paying a divi-
dend not to exceed 5 per cent, on the written
down capital, it was therefore provided that the
balance of the bank’s profits should go towards
filling up this awful hole in the treasury. But
obviously, in order to turn the appalling losses
into profits, it was necessary to change the policy
of Maoriland itself. Consequently, John Bal-
lance had already been put in power, and from
1893 Seddon and McKenzie were carrying on
the new policy. A long course of what is on this
side called “Socialistic legislation” had been
begun. A progressive land-tax —almost identical
with that now proposed by the Australian Labor
party—was introduced in 1893. To hasten the
cutting up of large estates the Land for Settle-
ments Act was also passed. The Advances to
Settlers Act followed in 1894, and thus a State
Land Bank was created which, up to the end of
its last financial year, had authorised advances
totalling £5,829,290. State fire insurance fol-
lowed State life insurance. A moderately high
(yet not high enough) Protective tariff had its
complement in compulsory arbitration. And so
on from State old-age pensions to State coal
mines. In the 13 years or so in which these
things have happened, the country, according to
all the rules of Anti-Sosh, should have been
brought to ruin, and worms should now be crawl-
ing among the decay. But, instead, there is this
message which the Anti-Sosh papers printed as
inconspicuously as they could, and then promptly
forgot:—
Under the Bank of New Zealand Act provision was
made for the extinction of the Assets Realisation Board
when the Valuer-General approves of a valuation, which
shows that the assets are more than sufficient to cover
the outstanding liabilities of the Board. This approval
has been given, and the Assets Realisation Board is ex-
tinguished as from December 17, 1906.
The deficit was originally estimated at £850,000.
But the real size and depth of the bog into which
Anti-Sosh had led the country had not been
realised even in 1894 ; and the hole in the bank’s
treasury has taken a great deal more than
£850,000 to fill. Yet in less than 13 years it
has been filled. Watch the progress of the
profits of the bank in the past 10 years :
1897 .. £136,891 1902 .. £289,502
1898 .. 182,532 1903 .. 290,591
1899 .. 191,420 1904 .. 293,316
1900 .. 242,520 1905 .. 320,909
1901 .. 300,242 1906 .. 330,330
And this bank hasn’t had anything special in the
way of luck either. The National Bank of Maori-
land, a mostly Bull-owned concern, has made just
about as much progress under the devastating influ-
ences of “ Socialistic legislation.” In 1897 it made
a profit of £21,461, and paid a dividend of 5 per
cent.; this year it reported a profit of £50,857,
and paid a dividend of 12 per cent. What is the
the use of setting the whirling words of poli-
tical intriguers against actual experiences of that
sort?

The “Reputable Employer.”
By the Yic. Factories Act, the pay fixed by the
Wages Boards must be that paid by the “ reput-
able employers ” in the trade under consideration.
Whether any employer is “reputable” who pays
his female operatives a weekly wage that necessi-
tates their loafing on their parents, or seeking
other means in order to keep themselves alive, is
a matter which never struck the legislature when
it framed the law. The fact remains that there
are any number of young women still working in
Vic. for a wage that is insufficient to give them food
and sleeping accommodation, let alone clothing.
It is impossible to maintain any young woman in
the poorest manner for less than 15s. weekly.
Still, in Vic., where the bricklayers are striking
for 44 hours’ work a week, and the slaughtermen
are threatening to strike because they can’t earn
more.that £1 day, Parliament has just agreed to
appoint a Wages Board in the paper-bag trade,
m which, according to the figures submitted to
the Legislative Assembly, the average wages for
men, women, boys, and girls is 12s. sd. a week !
An analysis of the wages paid to the adult women
gave an accurate idea of the position of the
workers in the trade. There are, of the total
number of 203 female operatives, only two re-
ceiving more than 20s. weekly. No fewer than
12 young women over 21 years of age are paid
less than 10s. a week, 27 are paid less than
12s. 6d, 46 less than 15s. ; 133 girls under 21
average Bs. lid. weekly. The “reputable
employer” in the paper-bag industry would
appear to be about as common as the anaconda in
G-alway. The cardboard-box makers, whom Par-
liament decided to protect by a Wages Board at
the same time, are in only a little better position.
There are 17 factories employing 512 hands, and
paying an average wage of 13s. 8d.—148 women,
averaging 16s. 2d. ; and 283 girls, 9s. 6d.
It is time that the “ reputable-einplover ” fiction
was swept out of the Vic. factory law“. The kind
gentleman who poses as a captain of industry and
talks in public about the way his capital is develop-
ing our fair country, while at the same time he is
paying girls of 21 less than would buy sufficient
food to keep them alive, even were they content
to sleep in a cave and garb themselves in fig-leaves,
is just about as reputable as a corpse-eater or a
hangman. If fact, did Vic. possess the English
law by which men who live on the proceeds of
vice are guilty of a criminal offence, he would run
an excellent chance of receiving two years for being
the sort of person he is.
The Press and the Electors.
Thebe is little virtue, as a rule, in discussing
lfs. But it is not possible to avoid saying that
if there had been one strong, truthful daily paper
in Sydney during December the stain of REiD-ism
would have been quite cleaned away from Aus-
tralian politics. As it is, REiD-ism is almost
eradicated. But by hard, persistent (and —what
was most aggravating—dull) lying and grievous
suppression, the. daily papers saved a remnant,
and tans helped in a measure to block Australian
progress. Tsothing was too mean or too absurd for
the press supporters of Reid. A typical instance:
Gr. Reid, on the very eve of the election, by an
ingenious bit of suppression and distortion, con-
vujted J. 0. Watson of “miserable disloyalty.”
Watson’s reply was effective, convincing. The
ITuly Telegraph promised to print it, and de-
liberately broke the promise. That was but one
or a series of monstrous injustices. The Deakin
Pf r ty and the Watson party in N.S.W., wherever
the bydney daily papers ranged, were gagged, and
as they stood, gagged and helpless, insolent liars
crept behind them and uttered falsehoods as from
their mouths. In many cases the common sense
ol the electors triumphed. The foul flood of
calumny was ineffective. But electors are but
human and the lies persistently told day after
day had some effect. What could have been done
under fair press conditions is shown by the Mac-
quarie contest. There Sydney Smith, perhaps
the cutest electioneering agent among the
IvEiD-ites, was opposed by Carr, a Laborite,
practically unknown. But the case for Australia
had been put for six months to the electors by the
.National Advocate with vigor, persistence, and
marked ability. The Advocate, though Protec-
tionist and not Laborite in policy, adopted Carr
as its candidate and carried him in. Sydney
could have been won in the same way to the Aus-
tralian cause if that cause had had a daily press ad-
vocate. But against the Herald, the Telegraph,
a -i a 0 News there was raised no press voice; even
the Star, which is supposed to be Protectionist,
was for some unaccountable reason dumb. Pro-
tection must have a press organ in Sydney before
the next elections.

The American Cocktail.
President Roosevelt —or Loosespelt —is evi-
dently as palsied of hand as he is strenuous of
tongue, and courageous only to attack the
English language, which hasn’t a gun to shoot
back. His attitude in the matter of the Japanese
and the State of California shows a moral
cowardice and a want of recognition of the
elementary principles of national honor, which
suggest that all his previous “strong” actions have
been just the bravado of a bully with something soft
to fight. There is one principle in foreign politics
to Which every “white” man should subscribe—
the hegemony of the white races. There is one safe
principle of home politics— not to allow any
foreigner to dictate on matters of purely domestic
admistration. Roosevelt violates both. The
State of California objects to its young white
citizens consorting in the schools with Japanese
children, scions of the most flagrantly immoral
people on the face of the earth. It is willing to
provide special schools, of equal standard to the
white schools, for the Japanese, but it will not
tolerate the mingling of its children with an inferior
Asiatic type. Japan chooses to take offence at
this. Roosevelt proposes to coerce California
intq admitting the Asiatic to school with the
white child. At present it seems as though Cali-
fornia will stand firm, and that the American
cocktail will reluctantly face the anger of
Japan rather than attempt a civil war. What-
ever the issue, the crisis affects Australia pecu-
liarly. Some folk in this land profess to find an
apology for a neglect of defence in the fact that
the-United States would always help Australia
if it were attacked by Asia.” It seems pretty
clear now that America would do nothing of the
sort. Further, it is evident that England is
watching the position with sympathy, not for
California, but for Roosevelt. As the Times
puts it:
Britain is sympathetically watching President Roose-
velt’s efforts, because one of her autonomous colonies
has created a similar problem by exclusive legislation.
Australia, if the day of trial finds the nation un-
prepared, can never plead lack of warning. There
have been warnings in plenty ; and this is one of
the most significant.
The Imminent Asiatic.
Staniforth Smith writes from Perth (W.A.)
To-day we need have little fear of an alien invasion
unless at the point of the sword. But 50 years a°*o the
fate of Australia hung in the balance. Upon the dis-
covery of gold a tide of immigration swept in from all
quarters. In 1853 the first Chinese arrived in Victoria •
four years later they numbered 35,000, or nearly 10 per
cent, of the total inhabitants. Of the 19,000 people who
landed in New South Wales in 1860, 12,000 were whites
and 7000 Chinese. In 1877 there were 15,000 Chinese on
the Palmer goldfield in Queensland and 800 whites ; and
on the whole of the goldfields of Queensland the Chinese
outnumbered the white diggers. The first protests came
not from the rulers, but from the miners. They builded
better than they knew. Their motive was probably
industrial rather than racial, but their action bore f-uit
in legislation which profoundly altered the destinies of
the British empire and the destinies of the world These
small, unchronicled, forgotten battles—called riots—had
more profound consequences than even Waterloo for
they decided not whether one dynasty or another should
rule a continent, hut what race should people one.
But we are now living in a fools’ paradise. The’instinct
that causes us to pass restriction laws has stopped short
of providing means for enforcing them under all circum-
stances. The question is not finally settled by the mere
enactment of a statute. The Mongol and Tartar races of
Northern China have shown themselves to be amongst
the most warlike of history. Under Attila, Genghis
Khan, Timur and Baber conquering hordes poured into
India, overran Western Asia, devastated Russia pillaged
Europe, and laid the Eastern Roman Empire under
tribute. The Turks, a Tartar tribe, still retain their
conquests of portions of Western Asia, Africa and
Europe. That this warlike instinct has not evaporated
by the misrule of ages, British generals such as
Gordon and Wolseley, bear testimony; and this
is further corroborated by the effective'Chinese regi-
ments commanded by British officers at Weihaiwei.
When the Yellow Colossus does awaken—as Japan has
done the probabilities are that she will again embark
in aggressive warfare. If so, she will either pour her
countless legions in a westerly direction, along her old
historic warpath, or direct them to the east and south
across the Pacific. Now the present trend of modern
commercialism is to help the war wave in that direction
by spreading a yellow wave of coolie labor southward and
eastward over the Pacific. The Chinaman is the best
coolie laborer in the world, because he is the only coolie
that comes from a temperate zone. For this reason he
is eagerly sought after by the mine owner and the
planter in the tropics. When the British first settled at
Penang, in the Malay Peninsula, there were no Chinese
as the Malay had enacted a stringent immigration re-
striction law, which he administered with a kriss or
dagger, and the mortality amongst the Chinese immi-
grants was an effective check to any great influx of
coolies. But under British rule the Chinese coolie was
welcomed, and to-day the Chinese throughout the whole
of the Peninsula are more numerous than the Malays
and the former are nearly all adult males. Another
yellow wave is gradually spreading over the Pacific and
the Chinese are planting industrial garrisons of able-
bodied men all over that great ocean as far as
Samoa. A mercantile fleet, owned and manned
by Chinese, is gradually expanding, to cater for
their wants, and, as all history has shown, commer-
cial fleets are the inevitable precursor of a navy to de-
fend the nation’s oversea interests. By the connivance
of the white races the Chinese are expanding their
Nationality but not their State. They may remedy this
a little later, and make their State conterminous with
their Nationality. If the Chinese once defeat a white
nation, either on sea or land, the “swelled-headedness ”
of the Japanese will not be a circumstance to the arro-
gance of the ten-times more numerous Chinese
The only colonial Power in the Pacific that has not
encouraged the advent of Chinese coolies is the Dutch
The u?v°r e /u nmei l t °J- th ? Neth erlands East Indies does not
them, but it places such disabilities in their wav
that the Chinese constitute less than one and a half per
cent, ot the total population. It is fortunate for Aus-
tralia that this chain of islands, stretching- right
across the north of Australia, from the south-
east of Asia to New Guinea, has resolutely with-
stood the Chinese invasion. The Yellow Wave has
beaten against their shores in vain. The Dutch policy
has constituted these islands a chain of block houses, the
advance-guard of the White Man’s entrenchment in the
South. If these immense and fertile islands, within a
few hours’ sail of Australia, had been overrun by Chinese,
as is the Malay Peninsula, our position would have been
perilous indeed. Our first line of defence would already
have been captured. But that is the only bright feature
in a position which elsewhere is gloomy—showing the
colored races gradually creeping closer to Australia,
making more sternly necessary that duty of defence
which we so seriously neglect.
♦
The TJ.S. Negro.
“K.” (an American) on the nigger question :
Wells, the English novelist, who has been doing the
United states for the British and Australian press, has
been pretty accurate in most of his observations. But
when it comes to sizing up the American negro he is
“ away off.” He sees the colored brother through the
spectacles of a thorough-going sentimentalist, and knows
nothing at all about him as he really is, forming his
opinions front ex parte evidence furnished by half-whites
like Booker Washington.
It is an ominous fact that the negro, once an object of
universal sympathy throughout the anti-slavery North,
has alienated his former champions since he has
come to live amongst them by thousands. Viewed
at close range, they find him vicious, indolent, stupid,
incapable of sustained labor of any sort. Whatever he
undertakes is more or less scamped, because he can do no
better. He will work until he has earned enough to eat
for a month or so. Then he quits, and does nothing more
till he is starved out. There are few colored men
who are skilled artisans; few colored women that
become good dressmakers or milliners. They can cook
because they are extravagantly fond of eating. Since
their advent into northern cities crime has increased
enormously. In the State of Pennsylvania they comprise
but one-seventeenth of the population, yet in one year
they committed 75 per cent, of the heinous
crimes. White women are the peculiar object
of their pursuit, either for robbery or worse. The
one crime which they persistently commit has so in-
creased that it is not as safe now for women to go about
after dark, or over lonely roads unprotected, as it was
when the forests were infested with savage Indians. It
is nonsense to attribute this to revenge for wrongs
suffered by the women of their own race at the hands of
their masters. Negro women do not consider themselves
wronged by such a relation except in rare instances;
they are rather proud of it than otherwise, an opinion
common to other dark-skinned races. Moreover, the
average American negro has very limited ideas
of marital fidelity, and changes his wives fre-
quently, when the law does not interfere. Nobody
takes his marriages seriously. The frequency and
ferocity of crimes committed by negroes against
white women, even in the North, outnumber like
atrocities for which white men are responsible, ten to one.
Education in the public schools, in which, although
paying a minimum of the taxes, they are admitted
on equal terms with the whites, has done the negroes
more harm than good. With the little smattering of book
lore they have developed an intense hatred, jealousy, and
envy of the whites, and these feelings show themselves
at every turn in insolence arid insult. The discreet pass
negroes in the highway without noticing them. The
“cheerfulness, and gaiety, and politeness,’’ which so
gratified Mr. Wells, in most negroes pass with swift revul-
sion to demoniac temper and sullen rage. All the negro’s
words and deeds have been summed up, by one who
knows him, as “ the words and deeds of one who is a
little lacking.”

Australia Points the Way.
The education controversy in Britain grows in
bitterness. It is a contest of doxies. The Con-
servative Government last in office designed a
system of State-aided education which gave all
the encouragement possible to Anglicanism, was
rather sympathetic to Roman Catholicism, but
roused Nonconformists to a pitch of fury, which
showed itself in the “Passive Resistance” move-
ment. The Liberal Government now in office was
expected to do justice to the Nonconformists ; and
the only way, of course, todo justice to one religious
doxy is by doing an injustice to another ; at least,
that is the only way understood of the religious
mind. Accordingly the Education Bill now' being
mangled by the British Lords is designed to please
the Nonconformists, but it infuriates the Angli-
cans, and isn’t loved of the Roman Catholics. It
may precipitate a conflict between Lords and
Commons, and perhaps an appeal to the country,
when heads will be broken in the name of
Christianity and coats torn for the love of
God. And, whatever the result, the conflict
will be renewed again and again. There will
always be a party of Passive (or Active) Resist-
ance, because there will always be a party with
the grievance that its pockets are being taxed to
teach children an alien and hateful religion.
The remedy (as Chamberlain, alone, seemingly,'
among British statesmen, sees) is for Britain to
follow the Australian example, and completely
secularise State education. It is advisable that
the State should teach its children how to read
and write, for reading and writing are the keys to
the acquisition and communication of practically
all knowledge, and as to the rules of reading
and writing there is a general agreement.
But it is not the business of the State to teach
children facts or fictions about episcopacy, or any
other religious controversy, because 'such know-
ledge is not of the least use in performing the
duties of citizenship, and because it is and always
must be a matter of opinion, and not of assured
fact. State education should cease with the limits
of secular knowledge; religious matters must be
left to the child’s parents. That is the Aus-
tralian idea, and John Bull will find he
will have to adopt it ultimately for the sake
of a quiet life. Whilst the Baptist pays
taxes to help teach children Anglican doctrine, or
the Roman Catholic is levied upon for the train-
ing of youngsters in the ways of Presbyterianism
there will be black discontent. Even the pro-
foundly irreligious man will be stirred to sectarian
fury at the thought of his wrongs under such
circumstances and will rage like any true believer.
Australia shows the sensible way out of the diffi-
culty. The more Britain delays in taking it the
more troublesome will be its education problem.
The N.S.W. Land Scandals.
There will be a general feeling of relief that at
last the Carruthers Government closes the book
of the Lands scandals. The farce had become
tedious. Surprise, indignation, anger long since
gave place to a weary sense of hopeless
futility. It was so obvious that nothing serious
was to result that an impatience at the long-drawn-
out pretence of willingness to do something be-
came the ruling sentiment in the public mind.
Now that impatience can be dismissed. There
will be no more pitiful explanations, apologies,
assurances- by Ministers. The spectacle will
no longer be presented of Punishment being
ostensibly flogged forward whilst held on a tight
curb. It is not a dignified thing to see the
majesty of the law performing astonishing
evolutions under such treatment; and most people
will be glad that the circus has ended. Let the
subject be dismissed with one last word in con-
demnation of the hypocritical sorrow expressed
by Sydney Telegraph at the frustration of jus-
tice- To the Telegraph credit is due for forcing
the Lands scandals on the public attention ; pro-
bably if it had not been for that paper there
would not have been even an exposure of the evil.
But when it became clear that to secure a cleans-
ing of the scandals a change of Government was
necessary the Telegraph j ibbed. The Carruthers
Government acted throughout as though it were in
constant consultation with those responsible for
the scandals. It may have been accident, bad
luck, stupidity. For the earlier false steps any
one of these apologies sufficed. But, when at
every step justice was frustrated by some blunder,
some extraordinary false step—so ingenious as to
have been quite worthy of emanating from the
master schemers on the other side —then it became
quite plain that, if punishment was to follow
crime, a, change of Cabinet was necessary.
The Cabinet was either sympathetic to the Lands
seandalists or was so unlucky as to always
blunder in their favor. But the Telegraph
wouldn’t hear of a change of Government. To
displace the “Reform” Government, meant to
instal an administration made up largely of the
Labor party. The Telegraph loved justice, but
it hated the Labor party more, and it cracked its
threatening whip when various disgusted fol-
lowers of the Government wanted to make a
change. Members had not had the lesson of the
Federal elections to show them what a vain
weapon that whip was, and they shrank from
taking the only action which gave any promise
of a satisfactory clearing-up of the Lands posi-
tion. So the farce was played out to its weary
end.
♦
Simon Fraser Stops Short.
When Simon Fraser was asking the Victorian
electors to return him to the Senate he made
some very violent and disrespectful remarks con-
cerning Socialism ; and at one meeting he assured
his audience that
The one and only way to national prosperity was
national and individual energy. As an example of what
could be achieved by energy, he referred to the wonder-
ful prosperity of Denmark.
Fraser stopped there, just like all the Tory poli-
ticians ; and he gave no particulars as to the pros-
perity of Denmark. If he had been honest, or if,
being honest, he had been less ignorant, he
would have pointed out that Denmark started
with a fairly big gang of rich landlords, and that
the first appearance of prosperity was when the
Government began to cut up their land and hand
it over to small farmers. The Danish Government
went one better even than Seddon, as it passed
a law preventing any man from owning more
than one farm, and from adding to his farm by
purchasing adjoining farms or land. Fraser’s
silence on this revolutionary proceeding was a
trifle deeper than that of the grave. The Danish
Government, however, afterwards went a step
further. At the present time, in Denmark, if a
man of good character can show that he has spent
seven years on a farm, the Government will find
him a farm, build him a house, and provide him
with cows and plant. As this is Socialism of the
first degree, it is possible that Fraser, who hasn’t
learned anything since 1890, didn’t know of it.
Or, if he did, he was a first-rate ass to mention
Denmark, as, by advertising its prosperity, he at
the same time praised, inferentially, its political
system. Yet a proposal to introduce the same
system to Australia w’ould cause devastation, and
ruin, and blight, and mildew from one end of the
continent to the other, according to the Fraser
type of politician.
The Statist’s estimate of the 1906-7 wheat harvest
in Victoria looks for a yield of 24,540,800 bushels
—a million bushels more than in the bumper
season of 1905-6. But only a poor 1,143.450
bushels will come off the Western district, where
the big land-bug straddles. That district is so
rich that that crop will come off 69,300 acres. In
Karkaroc, the principal wheat growing district of
the Mallee, even in this extra good season it takes
152,400 acres to provide that much wheat. So
violently does the big landlord upend natural
laws that in those very districts where the average
yield per acre is most, the area under crop is
least; the farmer, instead of being permitted to
cultivate the land proved beyond all question to
be the most suitable for farming, is driven out to
the areas also proved beyond all question to be
the least suitable. And then the big landlord
takes the farmer by the hand and, with his tongue
in his cheek,says, “Come, brother, let us resist
this common enemy of ours, this thieving,
plundering Labor party ! ” It is the champion
confidence-trick of modern days.
There is a Kanaka side, too, to a White Australia.
A letter from the New Hebrides :
This traffic to Queensland was viewed by us as ruination
to these islands. All the best men were taken away, and
the weak, deformed and diseased left behind to propa-
gate the native race, which leaves consequences easily to
be imagined.
There is more work than these islanders can do, and
a much better life for them in their own islands in
turning their cocoanuts into copra, which work
does not harm the white worker in any wav.
One sees a great lot of “ hogwash ” in some of the Aus-
tralian papers re the shame of returning these unfortunate
people to their own homes to be devoured by their own
brothers and sisters. And very rarely a murmur is
heard from our strange missionaries (who now claim to
have been working here for over 50 years, among these
benighted heathen), in protest against these Ananias
tales. There may be an odd case where a native has com-
mitted murder and then slipped away to Queensland or
elsewhere, and naturally the relatives of the murdered one
are laying in wait for the said murderer to return. But
even in the cases where this is true, the criminal is aware
of it, and can join other tribes, where he will get a good
welcome, not as an article of diet, but as an additional
member. Most tribes seem eager to induce outsiders to
join them. It is only necessary for these people to toil
about one day in the week for their living, so it is no
hardship to take in outsiders.
Some time ago there was a very one-sided letter from
a Fiji planter in S.M. Herald re return of New Hebri-
deans. This person suggested that they should be sent
to Fiji. This is strangely disinterested “ tommy rot ”on
his part. But the islander is not such a fool. It is
certain that, unless fraud or absolute force were used,
not one in a hundred would elect to go to the land of this
heaven-born philanthropist. If any place has got a call
on a person, it should be the one where he was born.
Some British planters at one time living in the New
Hebrides (about 12 to 14 years ago) had a great scheme
on to try and get Japan to annex this group. This, they
say, was about to be done, and Japanese men-o’-war, it
is alleged, had got as far as Noumea on the errand ; but
there was a change of Government in Japan just then,
and the Chrysanthemum ships were recalled. It was]
presumably, philanthropy that set these people scheming!

Without the fact being largely advertised, Mel-
bourne is at the height of another boom in
residential land. There are no sensational ad-
vances in city frontages to excite people, but
suburban house property is very nearly back again
at the level it reached in ’BB and ’9O. Lonesome
paddocks, a mile from some station to which one
train runs per hour, are changing hands at 30s.
and £2 a foot, and the pocket-handkerchief allot-
ment on long terms is selling like hot cakes. It
is practically impossible to obtain building land in
a decent suburb within four miles of the post-office
for less than £5 a foot, which is just about £2
more than any ordinary residential villa site
ought to bring. Residential land values in Mel-
bourneare about 20per cent, higher at present than

“E.H.S.” : Re Italian immigrants : —
I have spent a good many years in Brazil, some of them
in the town of Sao Paulo, in the hub of the coffee
“fazendas.” There I saw a good deal of the Italian
laboring classes. I believe in 1900 that there were about
70,000 of them working on the estates, or running cheap
stores, restaurants and macaroni factories. The Italian
laborer in Sao Paulo works well and is cheap, as he lives
on next to nothing. But when he has saved a few lira
he gets back to Naples or Milan. He is not a good
colonist. Another drawback may be learnt from the
daily monotonous shout by the newspaper boys as they
board the early morning business trams with “ Assassin-
ado de hontem ” (yesterday’s assassination).

High Court and Privy Council.
Pbivt Council decision in the case Outtrim versus
the State of Victoria brings about the tragi-comio
situation which was predicted would follow from
the existence of two rival final courts of appeal
from the decisions of the Australian State Supreme
Courts. The idea of the framers of the Constitu-
tion was to create an Appellate Court which
should breathe the spirit of the accustomed laws
of the people of the Commonwealth, and should be
the final tribunal for all Australia. The opposition
to this idea clung to the Privy Council fetish, upon
the “ stinking fish ” notion that Australians are
a poor, inferior lot, who are doomed for ever and
a day to get their oysters from the Greeks, their
fruit from the Italians, their vegetables from the
Chinese, and their law from Londoners. The
Bar of N.». W. solemnly assembled and averred
by resolution that it would be a national calamity
to do away with the appeal to that far-distant
Court,.and thus, by implication, avowed their
own small opinion of themselves in their pro-
fessional capacity—incapacity is a better word
—and their contempt for the courts before which
they practised. Outside the barristers, stout men
with heavy gold watch-chains—who wear silk hats
in summer—pathetically asserted that someone
was trying to do them out of the “right of every
Englishman” to take his case to the Privy
Council if he wanted to. Of course the Privy
Council was not open to every Englishman. In
fact, no Englishman in England had any right to
go there at all. The Privy Council is a little
branch of the British judiciary, which sits to
decide appeals from subject and colonial States.
Its policy was specially adjusted for Indian
or other subject States or colonies, as its
members never deliver dissenting judgments,
and its decisions are published as if unanimous,
so as not to disturb the minds of Indians,
Australians, Hongkongese, Canadians, Straits
Settlers, Guiana and Jamaica men. The pathetic
but not uncommon belief prevailed that, be-
cause the Privy Council was a long way off,
and in the Northern Hemisphere, it would de-
liver better judgments for Australians, just as
the English, French, and German manufacturers
are believed to be better able than we are to make
our wool into their cloth. Despite the fact that
the j udicial path of the Privy Council is strewn
with blunders caused by ignorance of local
conditions, laws and customs, the opinion
in favor of retaining it, as an alter-
native or concurrent court of appeal for
Australians, prevailed, except in one important
particular. In sec. 74 of the Constitution Act, it
was provided that no appeal lay to the Privy
Council from a decision of the High Court, how-
soever arising, as to the limits, inter se, of the
Constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and
those of any State or States... unless the High
Court gave leave to appeal. That is clear enough.
A case arose as to whether or no a Federal officer
should pay State income tax, and though the
matter in dispute does not show much intrinsic
merit, it served to raise the big issue which
loomed from the first. The cause, contemptible
though it be, is as useful as was the spilling
of the Boston tea, the finding of the
diamond ring by the sweep boy in Armorie
versus Delamirie, the refusal of the foren-
sically famous Six Carpenters to pay for
drinks, or John Hampden’s stubbornness in
the matter of ship money. The High Court,
after hearing two able counsel for and against—
Higgins on one side and Isaacs on the other, both
now colleagues of the deciding Judges—held that
an Australian or Commonwealth instrumentality
was one thing, and a State instrumentality
another, and that neither could interfere in the
proper sphere of the other. This is really a decision
after the hearts of the State-Rights, Ready-to-
Secesh party ; but they don’t seem inclined to
look at it in that way. The High Court, too, had
the courage of its decision, and declined to grant
special leave to appeal to the Privy Council. Had
it yielded it would have been utterly discredited
from that time forth, and the Constitution would
have been wounded in its most vital part. The
State Rights party got up another case, and
reached the Privy Council in another way,
relying upon a chance that that court might
follow the maxim and “amplify its jurisdic-
tion ” by ruling, as it apparently has ruled
(in overruling the State Supreme Court de-
cision, which followed the High Court
ruling)—(1) That the Judiciary Act is ultra
vires of the Constitution, and (2) that Sec. 74 of
the Constitution Act is a dead letter. We have
now two diametrically opposite decisions of the
two concurrent appellate courts, and the world
looks on laughing. The irresistible meets the
immoveable at last in the legal world. Whose
writ runs? That is the question to be resolved ;
and there is no higher court in existence to
resolve it. There is no Imperial Court, such as
that suggested by Mr. Haldane, which would
act as a final appellate court from all the courts
of the Empire, whether they sat at Sydney,
Montreal, Hongkong, Jamaica, Perth, Singapore
or London. The High Court will, perhaps, sit tight
and wait events. If execution of the judgment
of the Privy Council is attempted in Australia,
the High Court may treat it as a judgment of an
inferior court, and issue a writ of prohibition.
What Australian official will prefer to obey the
writ of a distant court to that of our own Aus-
tralian tribunal ? It is a pretty situation, which,
possibly, can only be relieved by an amendment
of our Constitution, sanctioned by the Imperial
Parliament. If it comes to that, all demo-
crats should stick out for absolute judicial
independence, not only as to the interpre-
tation of the Constitution, but on all matters
of internal concern; only allowing appeals to a
Central Imperial Court in matters in which the
external interests of the Commonwealth, or of its
citizens in relation to other parts or citizens
.of the Empire, are involved. The immediate
trouble may, it is suggested, be staved off
by amending sec. 39 of the Judiciary Act, with-
drawing Federal jurisdiction from State Judges.
If this is done, a Federal Judge will in such
matters be the Court of first instance, with the
appeal without choice to the High Court and no
other. This would, however, only be a palliative,
and the larger question must, in the end, be
settled —whether the High Court of Australia
shall be an Australian Court of Appeal in tact, or
merely in name.

The gay and festive season, when farm-
yards mourn that men may feast and doctors live,
won’t be quite in full swing in Sydney until
Saturday, when the Ward-Willougliby Co. (not
forgetting Grace Palotta) raise the laugh at the
Criterion. Since “ The Man from Mexico ” took
this city by storm, the gay comedians have been
touring all Australasia, sowing merriment every-
where. They came to Sydney after a bright tour
of Maoriland. The opening piece at the Crite-
rion will be “The New Clown,” said to be quite
as humorous as “ The Man from Mexico.”
#* # #
To-morrow (Friday) night J. C. Williamson
adopts the unusual course of shutting up Her Ma-
jesty’s (Sydney) to allow of a final full-dress re-
hearsal of “Parsifal”; and the unusualness of that
hints at the unusualness of the performance. The
advt. alleges that the mystery play will be the
largest stage spectacle ever attempted in Aus-
tralia. Miss Brune will, of course, be Kundry—
the lady who caused most of that trouble which
the first historic Percy set out to put right.
While “Parsifal” thunders by night, “ Alice in
Wonderland” will frivol by day. If this sinful
weather lasts, the two-shift system will have its
disadvantages ; the one consolation is that it will
probably be the lean, angular, spectacled kind
that will most throng to “Parsifal.” A swarm of
kiddies in the afternoon and a pack of beefy,
musical-comedy habitues by night would be too
much for frail flesh.

Salvation and dividends are having a
willing “go” at the Lyceum Hall, Sydney,
bought by the late Ebenezer Vickery, who there-
upon was hailed as a great and pious philanthro-
Eist. Just how the concern stands it would
e interesting to know. Usually when a
philanthropist buys a hall for mission purposes
he hands it over to the trustees ; and that is the
end of it so far as he is concerned. His reward is
supposed to come in the Hereafter. Apparently,
however, the Lyceum Hall is being run as a sort
of private speculation; possibly Mr. Vickery’s
death prevented the completion of arrangements
for the absolute transfer of the concern out of the
hands of Mammon. Anyway, there is the fact
that the big, old barn, which could no longer get
a license as a theatre on account of its structural
deficiencies, is let for no less than £65 a week,
Spencer, the theatrescope man, being the lessee.
Perhaps those who boss the business imagined
that Spencer could get the £65 a week rent by
exhibiting Scripture texts and illuminated mottoes
asking what is home without a mother ; perhaps
not. Anyhow, outside the premises whereon
blazed the motto, “Jesus Saves,” he put up bills
showing ladies in the sort of clothes the best-
looking girls wear in the Manly breakers; and
theseandan intimation that the flickergraph would
show how Satan, jun., went to Paris to find a
wife, so perturbed the good soul of David
O’Donnell, the missioner more or less attached to
the premises, that he hung out his bill to the
effect that he protested against the “ indecencies.”
It was a fine thing for Spencer’s show, and fat
men who hadn’t pushed their bald heads up the
Lyceum steps for many a day have answered the
call of David’s indiscreet advt.
** * *
“La Tosca,” especially in hot weather,
is an unpleasant epidemic of murder and
sudden death, which spares neither heroine
nor hero. Possibly, however, to make
quite sure that its beloved Tittell Brune
hadn’t met the same fate as her lover—-he
was to pretend to be dead, and really was a
corpse—the huge first-night crowd at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, clamored after the curtain
fell until La Tosca spoke as well as
bowed. It was a noisy, excited demonstra-
tion—mainly a girls’ demonstration—and the
little American gripped that situation when
she spoke her little girly piece—“ I can only say
I love you, and I’m so glad you haven’t forgotten
‘Sunday.’” That was about the 23rd time the
curtain had been called up during the evening.
(And, by the way, she has broken herself of the
little trick of panting, as if she had just run three
miles to be there on time.) Miss Brune hadn’t
quite forgotten “Sunday” either. Eloria Tosca
wasn’t of the type of that wild flower of the
Western camp, and yet in the earlier scenes with
her painter-boy Miss Brune introduced some of
Sunday’s manners and methods. But only
then and in the fourth act of tense tragedy,
after the murder of Scarpia, was her per-
formance less than good. She has hither-
to played no large, difficult part so well.
Nobody who has been seen on the Australian
stage for some years can nestle quite so cuddle-
somely; and the house expected that part of the
business to be satisfactory. What it didn’t
expect was the display of nervous force, first at
the door of the torture-chamber, afterwards while
Scarpia pressed his proposals. When she can
put some more magnetic thrill into the scene
after Scarpia’s death, and leave out traces of
mere Mary-Annery in the earlier scenes, it will
be a performance to remember her by. She has
good assistance. Thomas Kingston’s Scarpia is
a highly respectable old reprobate; Gaston
Mervale, as the artist-lover, is at his best in the
torture scene (earlier in the proceedings it is
sometimes difficult to follow him) ; new-man
Beauchamp represents the terror of the refugee
exceedingly well ; Miss Vaughan as the Queen
repeats her emphatic Elizabeth with a different
wig; and J. B. Atholwood presents one more
admirable character study.
** * *
J. C. Leefce, back frorp Maoriland, where
he didn’t do quite the business that the quality
of the co. he took with him warranted, is once
more in the manager’s crib at the Tivoli; and on
that part of the premises where they make more
noise but don’t count so much money, 0. L.
Fletcher, the new American sketch man, is
Siving representations of Charles Warner, C. L.
'letcher, and other celebrities. His business is
first-rate, though the representation of a man
entering the d.t.’s is cruel on a hot night. In the
present revival of the one-act playlet for music-
hall purposes, there has been nothing better than
Fletchers sketches. And you should see Cora
Casselli dance, even if you refuse to hear her sing.
Organist Lemare will give two recitals at
Sydney Town Hall before his departure, Wednes-
day 19th, and Thursday, 20th. He leaves on Xmas
eve for Canada, may be for years, and it may be
for ever ; therefore all who love the gigantic in-
strument that Lemare can make roar like the
surges as they closed over Atlantis, and reproduce
the footfall of fairies, and the dropping of dew,
ought not to miss the 20th.

Signora Dane Valenti’s first and last ap-
pearance in Sydney was made in the tired season.
Good class music takes some listening. One has
to work —for appreciation or criticism—certain
brain cells that lie at the back of one s listening
apparatus. Out of the tired season Sydney can
listen to a Brahms puzzle without being conscious
of any bustle in its grey matter, but on a December
night— ! Besides, there’s a finality about Decem-
ber. It’s the last joint of the 12-jointed tail, and
it can’t weg any more. All this to account for
the Signora’s limited audience. Her mezzo-
soprano is on© of th© best trained of its kind, but
she has some natural defects that training cannot
reach. Still she’s a very charming woman,
with a nice Irish brogue that is appar-
ent-even when she’s singing the songs
of fair and foreign lands. Herr "V ollmar and
Mr. Truman assisted, so did a dear young
thing named Bessie Beattie, who used to rise from
the piano and put her pretty bare arms behind
her back and then give a little bobbing bow.

“The Cotton King ” has been holding the
boards at Sydney Royal in spite of weather
which made even a cool house take on a Turkish-
bath atmosphere. Perhaps it was with a fore-
seeing eye on the thermometer that Bland Holt
staged the piece, for one of its attractions is a
shower of real rain, which is brought on in
Act I. as a sort of symbol of the troubles
that are to damp the spirits of hero and
heroine, to be followed, of course, by the
rainbow of hope and the clear skies of
prosperity. (It is always so in melodrama that
the worthy have a foretaste of purgatory first and
then a calm heaven in this world.) Aside from
its real shower of real rain and its very pretty
stage pictures and very exciting situations, “The
Cotton King” is rather shoddy stuff. There is
little sequence in the development of the plot. The
hero is rushed into trial after trial in a wholly
unnatural fashion. The members of the company
take familiar parts and fill them with due skill.
A feature is the acting of Miss Jennie Pollock as
Kitty Marshall, strong woman, a humorous part
which is played with brightness.
* .» * *
The “ Cotton King ” reigns until Friday.
The Xmas production at this theatre will be “A
Path of Thorns,” a drama located in “ the Rocks ”
district of Sydney and as yet new to Sydney.
Special preparations have been made to give a
worthy setting to the yarn.

Madame Amy Sherwin has engaged the
phenomenal-voiced tenor, Gerard Kean, for the
remainder of her Australasian tour. She will, of
course, teach him as well. His best friends say,
“ Heaven knows, he needs teaching.” The Sher-
win combination is working round towards Tas-
mania, where Madame Sherwin will spend Xmas
with her relatives.

Comic opera, which is not expected to
favor Melbourne again for nearly a year, devoted
its last week in this city to the revived “Girl
from Kay’s.” Florence Young, in the name-
part, presented a big, bold, business-like Winnie,
more likely to win a hat-shop than a Hoggen-
heimer. In real life, the purchase-money of
Winnie’s bonnet-store, if paid over at all, would
have been not,the proof of Piggie’s love, but the
price of his release. Lauri’s Hoggenheimer served
as an interesting reminder of the fact that
Williamson’s funny man has in his time played
many parts. Ghosts of bygone triumphs
troubled the Hoggenheimer vicinity. Wun-hi,
of the “Geisha,” showed his face at the
window, and gave a Chinese coloring to the por-
trait of a German-Jew. Crane, as the semi-
detached bridegroom, improved on his “Spring
Chicken ” form. Alma Barber made a decorative
bride and used her strong, serviceable voice with
good effect. The revival caught on, and patrons
rolled up in force to speed the parting favorites,
whose farewell house was a bumper one.
* * * *
Her Majesty’s (Melb.), which has been
closed during current week since the good-bye of
the “Girl,” will open again on Saturday (Dec. 22)
ablaze with the festive light appropriate to Xmas
pantomime. This year’s Noeltide attraction,
billed as a “stupendous production,” bears the
name of “Mother Goose,” the grandiloquent
poultry-wife of nursery tradition. Unlike her
prototype, J. C. Williamson’s “Mother Goose”
can hardly be accused of criminal exaggeration in
claiming that all her geese are swans, seeing that
the flock is to include Florence Young, Olive
Morrell, Harry Shine, Celia Ghiloni and Ernest
Fitts, besides new comedians, gymnasts and
animal impersonators.
* # * *
Owing to Flemming’s illness, his company,
lately located at the Princess Theatre, did not
attack the “ Walls of Jericho ” till their farewell
night (Saturday, Dec. 15). The three nights’
interval between that date and the finish of
“ What Would a Gentleman Do ? ” was filled up
by “The Passport,” with “In Honor Bound” as
a curtain-raiser. In the latter play, Mrs. Brough,
who does not appear in the “Jericho” pro-
duction, did her last work in Melbourne pro
tern., and annexed farewell flowers and ap-
plause one evening earlier than the rest of the
company. The favorite actress, who has often been
seen before in Sydney Grundy’s little drama of a
wife whose husband chivalrously breaks her fall
when the other fellow throws her over, made
her part as de'corative and attractive as hereto-
fore. Norman McKeown in the role of the
generous husband failed to equal the late Brough,
a predecessor in the part, in ease and likeableness.
In “ The Passport,” Beatrice Day showed that,
given a bright smile and caressing voice, a telling
torrent of feminine purr and cajolery may be ex-
pressed in the four words “How stupid you are ! ”
Gregan McMahon was amusing as the British
M.P., suspected of a “ false stomach ” by Russian
police, and subjected to search. As usual, Mel-
bourne is conscious of a pang in parting from
“the Broughs,” whose bitterest enemies have
never accused them of anything worse than too
little pretty girl and too much interval.

At Melbourne Opera House, Chanti, of
the national dances, is the crowning attraction,
though his pre-eminence is due to no sensational
ability either as dancer or musician. A lightning-
change dresser, he is surrounded by admirable
stage properties, which, in the twinkling of an
eye, enable him to shift his scene from Madrid to
Edinburgh, from Naples to Hongkong. It is
just as easy for him to conjure a bull iro
interior of a gondola as to transform a Bmvg f
into a joss house. Already the successful p y
to-day owes less to literary and dramatic g
than to gorgeous mounting, spectacular mag
cence, and prodigal expenditure. .Is Cn

The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, a
new musical society guided by the baton o
Alberto Zelman, junior, gave its first concert m
Town Hall on the evening of Tuesday, December
11th, and may be congratulated on the success
its maiden recital. Some 70 amateurs, aicied y
J. B. North and cellist Hattenbach, coped with
an exacting programme with intelligence, delicacy
and precision, their best effort being an exact and
dainty rendering of Haydn’s Clock Symphony.
Grieg, Mozart and Mendelssohn also received
worthy treatment, but Wagner was less fortunate.
In fact, owing to the palpable agitation of certain
youthful instrumentalists, the “Lohengrin _ bits
might without blasphemy be graded with items
served up at scholastic “ break-up ’ concerts.
Soprano Maude Harrington was entrusted ivith
the vocal work in “ Hear ye, Israel,” and “ Elsa s
Dream.”
** * *
A ’prentice penwoman, describing her first
trip to Dreamland, says that she was sent from
one turnstile to another but finally admitted.
The doorkeeper, explaining the delay, said ‘ I
' thought you were a Circular. Now, I see you re
a Press.” His hearer felt slightly piqued till she
realised that he referred to her pass, not to her
physique. The night was hot and the visitor
yearning for an “airship journey to the Moon’
was told to skip into the elevator before it left
Earth. Packed in the heart of a perspiring
crowd she found that though the lift
did not move, the noise of ascension was
simulated by hoarse rasping and creaking.
These uncouth sounds continued till the conductor
opened the door and requested the company to
climb upstairs. At the top, views of lunar sub-
jects were shown, and then the trippers toiled
downstairs again, and were once more imprisoned
in the lift, while hoops of jarring discord encircled
them as part of the “ illusions.” Out in the fresh
air the returned explorer questioned a small boy
re the desirability of “Bumping the Bump.”
Said he, “Men slide down on their trousers,”
adding, reassuringly, “but they gives ladies
mats.” A “Visit to the Unseen World ” was
next undertaken, in fear and trembling,
under the guidance of hooded attendants, whose
password seemed to be, “ Are you afraid to die ? ”
A little delay occurred while a facetious young
man was persuaded to get into a coffin. Being
refused permission to lie comfortably on his back,
he attempted to get out on the plea that he bad
not backed enough winners yet. A puff of
ghostly tapers, and then an empty shroud was
shown to the audience, which passed along to
inspect the caves of Dante guarded by Pluto’s
two-headed dog, alluded to by the conductor as
“ Sebberus.” An illusion, entitled “ The Drunk-
ard’s Dream,” concluded an improving and not
too terrifying run through Hades. Coasting,
merry-go-rounds and looping-the-loop were all on
hand, while in the Palace of Delights a bright
variety show kept people amused. Home, sweet
home must look to its laurels this summer.

Detectives must wish all criminals were
like the owner of the “Face at the Window,”
whose every-day suit is trimmed with cherry
ribbons, and who, when out for murder, adver-
tises his intention by donning a hag-like mask,
howling horribly, and grinning through the case-
ment of his intended victim. Those who wish to
dream bad dreams and ride black nightmares are
hereby advised to visit the Royal without delay.
On Saturday (Dec. 22) present eerie “draw”
gives place to “The Village Blacksmith,” who
will look the whole world in the face, conscious
that he is responsible for the re-appearance of
Miss Eugeni e Duggan.

Hot weather in Adelaide has meant the
substitution of moving pictures for all dramatic
fare. “Animated Australia,” which included
much faked American fun, has given place at the
Royal to “America at Work,” which includes
the Melbourne Cup and scenes in Japan. Inci-
dentally the looker-on learns in how many dif-
ferent ways one can make a fool of one’s self at
that haunt of the strenuous pleasure-seeker,
Coney Island. Madame Blanche Arral has
torn herself away from Adelaide after her
seventh farewell, and a big send-off has
been given to Stanley Newman, a local
youth who is going to follow music in London.
Few venturers in that line have his chance of
success, for he sings as well as, and acts far better
than, tbe usual musical-comedy hero, and it is an
open secret that Williamson would willingly take
him on, only unduly pious relatives object.
Lillah M'Carthy has been playing in “The Morals of
Marcus ”at London Garrick. The play reflects in no way
upon the conduct of Julius Knight and his legs in “ The
Sign of the Cross,” though the morals of M. Superhus
in that show were dreadful, and his fresh young spring
legs, as he chased Mercia round the apartment, were an
amazing exhibition.

AT POVERTY POINT.
In the Cold Country eating and drinking form an im-
portant. part of the big musical “ festivals. ’ Arthur
Sullivan, conducting at ope of them, was reproved
because “ the music was so good, that it hindered the
sale of refreshments, and the financial results were pro-
portionately unsatisfactory-” At the Handel Festivals
enough depressing harmony is introduced to make visitors
flv from the concert-room at intervals for the commis-
sariat department. Then a proud management points to
the consumption of so many tons of hams, buns, cow-heel,
pig’s feet and pies as proof of the advancement of musical
taste in the British Isles.
“F.0.G.” : After again seeing “La Tosca,” must ask :
What is the correct way to fall if you are shot real dead ?
Have noticed so many ways that I want some reliable
inforhiation, ant can’t strike anyone as authority on
point. Sass ma,de a very effective fall forward, after
slight quivering. Scot Inglis fell on knees, then back-
ward ; and Fie ary also fell back, when with Bernhardt’s
co. Most seem to favor the backward fall, which really
is most difficult for stage purposes. Saturday’s produc-
tion of aforesaid play was rather marred by a call for the
dead, and the resurrection destroys the spirit of the per-
formance. Any person killed dead at future perform-
ances should at least remain dead till oyster time.
Latest suggestion—by Miss Margaret Baxter, an Aus-
tralian journalist, now in London—is for the adoption of
some means of preventing ill-equipped vocalists from
coming to London. Perhaps the Commerce Act could be
applied, and only singers graded as first-class allowed to
be exported.
Between the acts of “ The Passport,’’ on election
night in Melbourne, Carter Pickford treated Brough-
Flemming patrons to progress reports of the polling.
“S.S.”: Plainly “What Would a Gentleman Do?” was
purchased for Australian consumption merely because
the omedy had an Australian character in it—at any
rate a character who declared that he was from Australia,
but who betrayed no qualities to distinguish him from a
Cockney clerk. Would the gentleman who brought this
play all the way to Australia because of this small stupid
appeal put up an all-Australian comedy if it were offered
him? Were the question put to him directly he would
answer : “ Yes, if the Australian play were a good one,"
which, freely translated, means that he would see the
Australian playwright boiled first. There was not even
this reservation in the case of “ What Would a Gentleman
Do?” whichismilesfrombeingagoodplay. Ihe Australian
chump dramatist could not easily do worse in construction
and stagecraft than the author of “What Would a
Gentleman Do ?” whose plot twice hinges on some
characters overhearing what other characters are saying-
in secret, who uses the clumsy device of the dropped
document, drags in a superfluous woman to demonstrate
a point which he decides to abandon after all, and messes
up his purpose like the veriest mug, beside making his
hero an ass and a snob and his heroine a vague stupidity.
It would be safe to wager that there are scores of better
comedies of Australians by Australians for Australians
given over to the corrupting moth, but this bad Cockney
comedy is imported and sprung upon us because of its
“ Australian appeal.”
“ Hiphen ”: Isn’t it time people gave over handing
round flowers? At a Melbourne show, recently, it struck
me as vastly silly to see a lot of full-grown adults standing
in a row before the footlights, while the he-actors ran
backwards and forwards like retriever dogs and brought
the chosen she-mummers large quantities of variegated
vegetables. The smirking recipients, looking like success-
ful prize-winners at a school speech night, grasped the
brimming baskets and draped them round themselves,
while their less fortunate sisters tried hard to look
interested and unenvious. When I make my debut as
Hamlet, or the Face at the Window, or something, I’ll
advertise “No Flowers.” Then if the admiring people
simply must have some outlet for their homage, they can
hand across the footlights any little trifle such as motor
cars, or diamond studs, or whiskies and sodas. I’d know
what to do with those, but it must be exasperating to
have a lot of expensive vegetables decaying on your
hands at bedtime.
An enthusiastic French biographer tells how the
divine Bernhardt was once wet-blanketed. After a re-
hearsal, Sarah, surrounded by the usual group of adorers,
suddenly exclaimed, apropos of nothing, “ Ah, what a
life ! What a life i It is astonishing how bored I am.”
“ Viable ! you are hard to please,” protested the adorers.
“Yes, it is all very fine,” responded Bernhardt. “ But the
end ! Ah, the end ! The thing is to end well. The climax
should be dramatic and stirring. Suppose that Rochefort—
whose death I do not wish, understand me—had been
killed t>y a bullet at the moment of his escape. What an
admirable death ! There is a climax—a fine fifth act. I
should like to end that way ! Gambetta ended well-
drama, mystery. Oome, tell me, how do you think I
shall end ?’’ Then, says the recorder with bated breath,
a very young comedian, almost a supernumerary,
shrugged his shoulders and answered his directress —his
directress !—with the thick and mocking accent of the
Paris street boys: “You? How will you end, you? It
isn’t hard to guess. You will end as a box-opener i ”
A glimpse of Melba in the first flush of her Parisian
success is given in Robert Sherard’s recent book of
reminiscences, “ Twenty Years of Paris.” Sherard met
the prima donna just after the triumph of her ddbut at
the Grand Opera in Thomas’s “ Hamlet.” At the end of
the fourth act she was recalled three times, which,
according to one of the directors of the Opera, had not
happened to any artist there for over thirty years.
Melba cherished a photo, of Gounod, which the composer
had inscribed to her as his ideal Juliet, and Sherard says
he found her pleasant speech a refreshing change
from the malevolent remarks about others which
rule in the French musical world. She con-
fessed to being upset when the critics were hostile,
but just then the only thing they could bring against her
was that she was a foreigner. “So I am,” she said. “ I
am an Australian girl, and I am proud of it.” Shortly
afterwards a rival prima-donna—an unnamed American
—waged war with Melba in the press, in offensive para-
graphs which were frequently copied into Australian
papers. Melba appealed to Sherard, as an experienced
journalist, concerning the best way of answering these
attacks. She accepted his counsel of silence. A curious
phase of European “criticism” is revealed in the men-
tion of a man who at that time held a leading position
on Lb Petit Journal, the most widely-circulated French
paper. This alleged critic added largely to his income
by teaching foreign vocalists and actresses how to pro-
nounce French. Those who refused to accept and pay
for his tuition were unmercifully cut up in the Journal
—on purely artistic grounds, of course. Melba, like
most others, allowed him to polish her accent. He was
a pirate of such tonnage that it was cheaper to make
terms with him.
Ethel Clarke, now making a large name in ’Frisco, is a
daughter of Marcus Clarke, novelist, &c. The lady
inherits her dramatic talent from her mother, Marion
Dunn, who was a capable actress, and from her maternal
grandfather, the old-time comedian, John Dunn, whose
real name was John Benjamin Donohoe. Marion’s elder
sister Rosa, now Mrs. L. L. Lewis, was also in the fore-
front of the profession in the sixties.
The baldhead in the front of the stalls is no longer a
figment of the humorist’s brain, but, according to
Macfadden, the Yankee nut-eating physical culturist, a
solid scientific fact. Macfadden asserts that men become
baldheaded purely as a result of looking overmuch on the
girl when she is rosy, and sporting with Amaryllis in the
shade during youth. Macfadden, it may be observed, has
more hair than a minor poet, and apparently he doesn’t
sport with Amaryllis in the shade—anyhow his nude
colony of New Jersey cranks has so far been run without
any breath of scandal, and the man who can keep the
breath of scandal off a gathering of wholly naked men and
women, most of them young, has kept a very large fly off
the meat.
It is gushingly announced that the retiring Patti is “the
only concert singer who can boast of having been kissed
by a reigning monarch —the King of Spain.” But there
are doubts. The fact seems to be that Patti is the only
singer who was kissed publicly, and before reliable cor-
roborators.
“ Cockaigne ” : H. B. Irving is making a distinguished
success in America. He will yet find his way to Aus-
tralia. His likeness to his sire, with his genuine talent
and experience to back up the resemblance, enables him
to strike fire. He acts “The Bells,” “Charles 1.,"
“ Hamlet,” “ The Lyons Mail,” “ Richard III.,” and other
of his father’s favorites ; also, studies such as Shylock,
Louis XI., Becket, and Benedick. Then there is the
advantage of his father’s costumes and appliances, and
the performers that were trained to support Henry the
deceased. Charles Kean was thus made by following
his father Edmund, but had the disadvantage of not
being a bit like him. Edmund had thin, aquiline,
Hebrew features, with great lustrous eyes ; Charles had
a flat face, turn-up nose, and little eyes. Yet the name
carried him. H. B. Irving’s lack is in the bizarre, angular,
eccentric, outr6, peculiar, unique, all those things which
make a Henry Irving, Bernhardt, or Ellen Terry stand
out. Yet he may be a great actor.
There is a “ Katsudo Bioscope Co.” in Queensland now,
all Monkey, from tail to tip. And some people swear that
the little Jap who runs it is one of the horse-buyers sent
out by his Government some time ago, and wonder if he
has returned to gather up information (in addition to
what he collected before) against annexation day.
The Londoners lately gathered in thousands at the
Albert Hall to welcome Clara Butt after her rather long
retirement, necessitated by a severe illness and a new
baby. Any misgivings that the audience might have had
were dispelled as soon as the colossal lady started to
sing. The Referee critic said that “her magnificent
voice appeared to have gained in volume by her extended
rest.” If it is going to gain anymore volume Madame
Clara will make Australia sit up in sheer astonishment
when she raises her warble hereabouts.
Kate Rooney has been interviewed in London. She
attributes the fact of so many Australian songstresses
being contraltos to the sunshine, open-air life, and in
some cases the scent of the gum-trees. Also she reckons
that although she is a pure contralto herself, she can
nearly sing bass, and can also warble soprano at a pinch.
It’s a yes-no sort of voice, and can only be put down to
the presence of Greid in the place.
When Beerbohm Tree produced “Julius Caesar” at
London Haymarket, he put out posters bearing a replica
of a Roman coin with Caesar’s effigy and the date “ 8.0.
47.” “8.0. 47” showed great foresight on the part of
the Roman Mint of the period.
After reading one of those frequent theatrical inter-
views which consist of a gush duet between interviewer
and interviewee, it is refreshing to remember the way in
which old-time tragedienne Isabella Dallas Glyn re-
ceived butter on a lordly dish. “Allow me,” said her
new husband to a friend, “to introduce you to the most
charming woman in Europe.” The average star actress
would have swallowed the flattery beamingly, but Miss
Glyn silenced her ardent Dallas with, “ Don’t be a
damned fool, Sam ! ”
Why is it necessary for every musical comedy actress to
show her teeth in her photograph ? She isn’t expected
to go out with her mouth open at other times.
Says a London writer : “ The Gibson girl on the stage
combines the minimum of speech with a rather audacious
display of physical charms and novelties in millinery.”
Truly, this becometh a distressingly narrow world ! A
photographer and an icecream vendor recently applied
for summer pitches near the Zambesi Falls (Africa).
“Hamer”: Melodramatists missed a great chance of a
sensation whilst the meat scandals w’ere on. How it
would have fetched the house to see Frances Ross point-
ing a tin of American beef at Norman and daring him to
do his worst.
Two years ago there was hardly any
prickly pear in the Wimmera (Vic.). Now, it is
taking possession of roads and reserves.
“Retired Captain” on niggers, heat, and
other discomforts: —
White soldiers in India will march and work Sepoys to
death every day, even in the hot weather. In the
trenches before Delhi in ’57 the white gunners, when the
firing was heavy, worked the Sikh gunners to a standstill.
There was no want of courage, but there was want of
stamina in the Sikhs. Native regiments die like rotten
sheep in unhealthy districts; and when native and
European regiments in the same station get epidemics
simultaneously, the percentage of cases is greater and of
recoveries less among the natives. There is a great deal
of nonsense talked about the Indian native army. The
men are brave enough if they are rationally handled ; but
they must not be tried too high—must not be called on
for long, continued and strenuous exertions, or they will
collapse! A hot season in the plains will decimate a
Gurkha regiment with low fever. A winter at Gilgit, or
Darjeeling (which is much lower), will make half the
men of a regiment recruited in the plains die of pneu-
monia. When they once get down they rarely get up
again.
“ Sol ” : These Germans are a frugal race.
The other day, I was buying some cheese in a
delikatessen shop, when I found my friend, Von
Sauerkraut, picking the fattest out of a dozen
dried eels before him on the counter. “It vosh
seldoms I buy heem,” he explained, on my asking
courteously if he liked eels. “Mein last ill last
me four year.” I suggested that possibly Von
Sauerkraut liked his eels “hung,” as the English-
man likes his game. “ Naw,” he replied, “dot
vosh not it. I use heem as a slitrop to sharpen
mein razor. But, last week, I drink too mooch
laager von night, und der next morning mein
hand shake. Whist, whist, whist I go, und, before
I know heem, I cuts troo der ill.” “So you had
to chuck it away,” I said. “Shuck heem afay !”
cried Von Sauerkraut, indignantly, “ Naw blut
fear ; I eat heem ! ”
King Holiday is again beginning to peep
beamingly over the mountain tops of toil. And
the country is prosperous enough just now to
indulge in a right good “recreate.” For that
matter, Australians need have no uncheerful
moments at work or at play. They can recreate
all the time. By resorting at judicious intervals
to D.C.L. Whisky their optimism is kept ever
bright and sparkling. D. C. L. is more than a cheer-
ing spirit. It is the very spirit of cheerfulness.*
A very old controversy is revived in Ade-
laide by the Light celebrations. The‘first Sur-
veyor-General of S.A. was a colonel under
Wellington, and came near to getting the
Governorship. As surveyor, George Kingston
(father of G. O. Kingston, and afterwards for
many years Speaker of S.A. Assembly) was second
to him. When Premier Price last week brought
in a graceful reference to Kingston’s assistance of
Light, one of the “pioneers” sitting in a place of
honor close by broke in with “No, no; he
killed him,” All that is certain is that
Light battled hard for the present site of
the city when others wanted it to be (1)
six miles away, on the shore; (2) on Kangaroo
Island; (3) at Port Lincoln; (4) at Encounter
Bay. (The first Judge of the infant colony got
himself drowned while trying to prove what a
safe anchorage Encounter Bay was.) Authority
came from London for Kingston to supersede
Light under certain conditions; but the latter
■carried his point, and soon after, still in harness,
died —of a “broken heart,” as legend has it.
However, the recollections of a person now
living as to a political point of 70 years back,
are not likely to be more than hearsay matter,
and whether Kingston did anything more than
his plain duty remains an open question.
ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will he taken of
insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MS. No liability is under-
taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no 3IS. ivill be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
W.G. : (1) This paper would strongly favor a
law penalising marriages between whites and Asiatics
and Africans. (2) The existence of various State land
taxes complicates the position in regard to Federal land-
taxation. The best idea would be to make the Federal
land-tax cover the whole ground and leave the States to
drop their local land-taxes. Just now that isn’t within
practical range, and for want of something better The
Bulletin favors Watson’s tax designed chiefly to burst
up big estates... .S.F.O. : “ Carpe Diem ” rather wooden.
No good carpying the diem with a wooden hand ; you
must rush it with a dexterous and agile paw.. r.Shrimp :
‘ Dumping Ground ” balanced on the edge of the basket
for a breathless space, then fell in M. : “The Para-
lvtic” declined. Too unreal. No address on it for
return Dairy woman : Thanks; hut it boils down to
this, that if you wash the cow she is clean ; if you drain
the yard and shift the muck it isn’t dirty ; and if the
dairyman likes he can talk of other things besides cow.
None of which Sorenson disputed S. Bunn: The
M’Ginnis who tries to rhyme “dawning” and “morning”
must sleep it off in the w.p.b Waihi: It isn’t
Socialism that Bull-Cohen is afraid of—it’s wildcats
Dot: The law is not altogether an ass in that matter ;it
counts as more serious the theft of live stock than of
chattel property, because the first is easier. The thieved
can walk away with the thief. To balance matters, in
the possible thief’s mind the punishment is heavier
J.M.B. : Sincerity doesn’t atone for commonplace ex-
pression Lai Lee: Your poem on the crowning of
Judkins not nearly funny enough for the theme. Doubt
if any poem could be G. Mac. : Yarn was intended for
a joke. If you take everything .in the “ Abo.” column
seriously, you have a dull life ahead of you G.R.H. :
Rather laborious Viking: The Blue Mountain tracks
are all the work of Australian engineers. One of the
most difficult was carried through by the caretaker of
the local reserve A.D. : N.S. Wales (being unhappily
rather singular in that respect) does provide cottage
homes where poor ancient couples may live together
A.L.R. : A verse as a sample—
You can’t apostrophise like that in The Bulletin. The
outraged ocean might come and wipe us out with a tidal
wave 8.G.: A slight sub-flavor of nastiness, and that is
all.. .Rambler: Good sentiment hardly well enough put...
R.D. (S. Africa): Really find it impossible to acknowledge

Would have printed it all if the rest had been as good as
this:—
... .Harriet S.: Just jingle Chummie : New-chummie.
p.M. : Your statement that you do not care a damn
for Fame makes decision easier. Hardly up to the mark.
First Time : Not jocose enough Bill Brown : The
Bulletin’s political policy is neither altogether that of
the Labor party nor the Protectionist party. It is of The
Bulletin party W.W.C. : What’s the use of publishing
things like “ the Christ Myth.” This paper doesn’t want
to attack religious dogmatism except when it comes into
conflict with human liberty and progress Tara winger :
Not of enough interest Tongatera: Just miss....
D.D. : Thanks, but we very rarely reprint verse ; have to
decline nine-tenths of the original verse submitted
T.D.T. : Can’t help admiring the pertinacity which
makes you submit the same yarn from 1904 to the very
edge of 1907. But it is a hopeless yarn and hasn’t im-
proved with keeping... .Sunol: Just anti-Sosh 1ie....
G.R.H. : “Settlement” too rough—wants clearing. We
couldn’t get even our stump-jump plough through
Ruaki: Yes. They’ll be kept clean out of The Lone
Hand, which, on present showing of copy, promises well.
Bluey : Rather thin Democrat: Yes ; a clause of
the proposed Australian Constitution disallowing such
appeals was rejected by the British Parliament
A. W. : Unfortunately the yarn is an old one
V.P.H. (Northern Territory): Thanks sincerely.
T.G. : A series of horrible puns; and The
Bulletin detests puns. Send ’em to Paunch
Stever : (1) The Bulletin has a specially warm welcome
for the “ outsider ” who can send in good stories and
verse. You needn’t test the truth of this by such clumsy
and dishonest-seeming expedients as sending in good
stolen stuff. Send good original matter, and a cheque
will promptly smile back at you. Your naive confession
that you sent in an old bit of Bulletin verse under your
own name, “just to test our impartiality,” would earn
you the black list in most newspaper offices. (2)
“Laughing Art” doesn’t get above the dignity of a
giggle" Lantana : Keir Hardie and his “ sandals sensa-
tion ” is just another deplorable evidence of the silliness
of British reformers. Hardie seems to be a good deal of
a humbug. He won the eye of the public first by
wearing a tweed cap in the House of Commons.
Now he is paragraphed for wearing sandals. The
Radicalism that find expression—and advertisement—in
that way isn’t even skin-deep Maiden (a masculine
one): Your gloat upon “ the parts that you can peep at ”
through the soft and summer blouse doesn’t suit The
Bulletin. (It is the religious papers that believe in peeping
through the key-hole.) Don’t be so unhealthily gloaty.
J.D.P. : Sorry, but there’s not much joke in it except
“plurry,” and “plurry” by itself makes no laugh
A.M.C.: A tax was first levied on tobacco in France in
1621. In 1674 a Government monopoly was established.
The Farm Act of 1781 interdicted the culture of the
plant in France, except in some provinces. The
State monopoly was re-organised in 1810 Mopoke :
Not finish enough. It has the bones of a good
story F.C.M. : Fairly good verses—with a slump here
and there E.M.D. : But even doggerel should have
correct verse-form F.C.W. : Style too magniloquent
and affected G.W.: Pretty, after a small, pale fashion.
Red Cross: Doesn’t cry out for print J. Hard-
castle: “Kelly” rather unsuitable; other ridiculously
unsuitable Orlando: “Ghosts” rather a tame joke.
Doesn’t seem to have a buck in it Cain: We try to
avoid death-bed poetry Sesame: “Which” is rather
an old subject. Stamps received (being stuck on they
were little use), but no name or address Alastor : Too
trivial J.J.W.: In the way of stating plain, square
facts in a plain, hard, square way, without a shred of
inspiration, you filch the bun G.A.: “ Memory " rather
amateurish.. . .A.R. : “Mona Lisa” a very slender little
fragment.. ..Ruby L.: Excusable, as a first attempt
O.A.G. : Pretty good idea, but you haven’t squeezed
enough out of it Exile : Spoilt by some feeble lines...
Syd. 0. : Bulletin stories are not specially remarkable
for the slaughter of the heroines. The B. heroine has as
good a time as any other heroine.... A.A.T. : Lacks force
and vividity Burravic: Pretty good attempt, but
subject impracticable Nameless : Mawkishly erotic...
S.T.S. : Too illegible to trouble with .... J Fin : Thanks ;
but it isn’t good enough. And, to be logical, you ought
to be ashamed to live in a country taken from the Maoris.
Poor Traveller : You seem to revel in the beastliness
of the subject. Don’t remember the other items
A.W.T.: Verse quite hopeless, and the only good one of
the jokes is a chestnut....H.B. (Vic.): A fair piece of
description, but it might just as well have been in prose.
... .Kerosene : Purposeless and pointless L.E.: Versi-
fication too stiff and awkward....H.O.G. : Very well
versified, but otherwise unsatisfactory W.G.O. : Story
rather insignificant. Verse poetic in tone, but mechani-
cal. ..S.M.T.: Too conventionally sentimental. ..A.W.W.:
If you take the dialect out of it, the humor is gone....
J.H. : “Old Letters” verj' humdrum and jig-joggy....
Copra: Too much preliminary... .Cam : Spirited, but
faulty in workmanship.

Unsuitable.
G. R. Sims explains why the Englishman
“ does ze Continong ” :
We go abroad where, under Protection, we can get four
times as much for our money as Freetrade England offers
us. I can take a month’s holiday in a protected country
for less than I can take a week’s holiday in Freetrade
England. That is why the Freetrade English, the
moment they get a fortnight’s or a month’s liberty, rush
to spend it where there is Protection, and their food costs
them less.
This N.S.W. Ministry is very anxious to
advertise its holiness. The other Sunday, Minister
for Lands Ashton and Education Minister
O’Oonor, in company with Donaldson, M.P.,
visited Tumberumba in connection with a railway
matter, and were invited to attend a banquet in
the School of Arts. When it came to the question
of speechmaking, Minister Ashton got up and
informed them that he was married to a parson’s
daughter, that his colleague O’Conor was the son
of a parson, and old Bob Don. was (or used to be)
profoundly religious. He thought it would under
the circumstances, the day being the Sabbath, be
better to have a dumb show. Thus the holiness
of the Ministry was proclaimed. Less skilful
advertisers would have merely refused to attend
the banquet.
Wairoa (M.L.), where the wild cherries
grow so abundantly, and where the eruption of
Tarawera overwhelmed in mud and scoria 250
Maoris, has suddenly discovered that it has a
succession of wonderful caves. Years ago a man
went there and built a cow-shed against the side
of the hill, and struggled along, making little
more than a crust selling milk, and butter
to tourists, never dreaming that in his bit
of ground was the entrance to caverns that
would be as good as a gold mine to him. Then
heavy rain brought about a fall of earth, or some-
thing, and revealed the secret. He is giving up
the cow business now, and has settled down to
smoke in quiet comfort while tourists drop cash
into his till for the pleasure of looking at the
orifices.
The working woman has so far kept out
of politics—excepting in the important matter of
voting-—but the Tory woman, who protested all
along that she didn’t want the vote, has rushed in
and has generally shown herself up in a very bad
light. The Women’s National League first chose
Foreign-trader Hewison to carry their rag in
Balaclava (Vic.), and would apparently have
stood by him but that he had some conscience,
like Iceberg Irvine, and declined to subscribe to
the fourth plank of their platform,' the hypo-
critical “ abolition of the marriage tie ” lie. Then
those “ladies” turned dog on their choice, and
chose fat landlord, Agar Wynne. Even then
Hewison kept silent, but when they started to
brand him as an interloper and a vote-
splitter, he reckoned it was time to tell all
he knew; and that “all” included some large
names who “thought this a good move, this
cry, and they ought to stick to it.” Hewison
was probably too polite to tell some of these ladies
that the “ purity of the home ” was rather a two-
edged cry ; he contented himself with criticising
their notions of political honor.
Tam Sie, of Geraldton, reputed to be
Bananaland’s wealthiest Chow, who belongs to
the inner circle of the banana ring, was inter-
viewed at Cairns, recently, by some of the press
which barracks for colored slaves to run the sugar
industry. But Tam Sie rather surprised the local
advocates of black and colored labor. Some white
gangs on the Johnstone, he said, were making
good wages, although many who had come up to
tackle the job were physically unfit, and probably
would go away and say the work was not good
enough for whites. Where the heat is worst, he
says, the men can spell in the middle of the day,
and still earn 12s. White men could do well
growing bananas, too, while the work is much
easier than cane-farming. The industry, properly
regulated, even under the shadow of the ring, can
be made to yield £3O per acre annually. Tam
Sie, by the way, is the gentleman to whom a well-
known skipper on the northern coast habitually
took off his cap. When Geraldton came down to
the wharf to see the boat off, it was “Day,
Jones,” “Day, Smith” ; then, with a lift of the
cap, “ And good day to you, Mr. Tam Sie.” You
see, Mr. Tam Sie owned a very large slice of
Geraldton.
Ye mighty froth ! Ye whitened foam !
Why seek ye in the rocks a home ?
What seek ye there amidst the rocks,
Which render to thee naught but knocks?
Who troubles if fences you send him round
Are never strained up or mended ?
What matters it if, with wisdom profound,
Stud ewes and flock rams are blended ?
He don’t care a cuss—then why need you ?
The firm must pay for its Jackeroo.

HIM : “ Darling, I love you so much that I dream of you always."
HER : “ Oh, rot I If you loved me properly you wouldn't he able to sleep at all."
Grafton (N.S.W.) has had a hanging after
more than a score of years. Young Brown’s pre-
decessor was Liddiard, who chopped his victim
into pieces and put them into a sugar-bag and
dropped the parcel into the Richmond River at
Wardell. That was a case of jealousy ; the mur-
dered man had been paying Liddiard’s wife a
little too much attention. On the morning of his
execution, when leaving his cell, by way of
strengthening him for his long journey, the lady
over whom all the trouble had arisen called out :
“ Be a man, daddy, and hold up your head.”
It would be hard to over-estimate the
value of the service to the public done by N.S.W.
Chief Justice Darley in his judgment in the Rofe
case. Rofe was a well-connected, wealthy, and
higbly-religious solicitor, who was found guilty by
a jury of participation in a noisome conspiracy to
blast the good name of an innocent woman. Judge
Backhouse sentenced him, and then, by a strange
perversion of mercy, released him under the First
Offenders’ Act. The only punishment inflicted on
Rofe was to be struck off the roll of solicitors.
This month he had the impudence to ask to be re-
instated. Chief Justice Darley, in saying “no,”
commented :
A petition supporting the application was put in,
signed by 396 solicitors, who said they were prepared to
practise with applicant. The grounds the Court went
upon in refusing the application were mainly that the
applicant had been convicted by a jury of one of the most
heinous crimes it was possible for a man to commit.
Short of murder and conspiracy to murder, it was about
the worst. A man who could commit such a crime ought
never to be a solicitor.
And he significantly remarked that he “would
offer no opinion ” as to the action of Judge Back-
house in giving this man the benefit of the First
Offenders’ Act. There has grown up in Australia —
and most particularly in N.S.W.—a tolerance of
public misdoing which constitutes a grave threat to
the Commonwealth. The quality of mercy is
strained to breaking point. Notorious male-
factors pose as martyrs or swagger as heroes. A
false sentiment of generosity induces those who
should withstand such wrong-doing to give it a
lazy tolerance or an undeserved pardon. Public
life wants more of the cleansing sternness which
Chief Justice Darley showed in this case.

And when she has a “cured” and extra-grumpy
husband on her hands, woman, lovely woman,
will wish she hadn’t meddled. Smoking is bad in
a lover, for it abates his ardors; it is good in a
husband, for it makes him contented with his lot.

A slab on the proposal to import domestic
servants from Britain (Sydney Telegraph) :
It should stand to reason that fresh, healthy, fair-
skinned girls from a cold climate will be more desirable
wives and future mothers to the sensible working man
than the general run of thin, sun-dried maidens of Aus-
tralia. And as marriage breaks all contracts, it would
be as well to study all sides of the question before tempt-
ing girls to leave solid English homes to live an artificial
life in Australia.
In the name of snakes why always this cry for the
imported article? Any unprejudiced traveller
will attest the fact that there is ten times the pro-
portion of pretty girls in Australia compared with
Britain. The girl of “the working classes” in
Australia is, as often as not, fit by speech, by
appearance, taste in dress and education, for any
drawing room ; in Britain that cannot be said of
one working girl in a thousand—or ten thousand.

Victorian railway men are wearing proud
rooster-feathers over some of the things in the
summer time-tables, and they are wanting to
know what about Tait now. The largest, gaudiest
rooster-feather is worn on account of the Bendigo
express, which, after being absent from the tables
for some years, is restored, and between Kyneton
and Castlemaine is scheduled to do 22 miles in 23
minutes; and that, Victorian railway men say,
knocks out anything else in Australia. But the
trouble about Tajt hasn’t been over bis time-
tables and schedules, which have been almost as
fine as the titles of his new officers. The thing
that has moved Tait’s travellers to hot language
has been that neither rolling stock nor permanent
way have been well enough maintained to allow
of the magnificent schedules being observed.
“In the first stage,” said the asylum
doctor, “hard work and knocking round in the
open often work wonders. Put Napoleon, or St.
Paul, or Dowie hoeing potatoes or at some other
work where he won’t have to think much, and
there’s a chance of his waking up some morning
as plain Bill Smith. Sometimes it’s a job to get
them outside, though. One chap we had in here
refused to go out until the poultry was penned
up. He reckoned he was a grain of wheat, and
that the fowls were waiting to swallow him. He
' was more trouble than a ward-full of kings.”

“Eroo”: Bulletin comments on the fer-

and says “he would sooner break his neck than
come a bad second in the race. ” I’ve noticed, after
a long and careful study of the swift and fascinat-
ing marine product, that his celerity in pursuing
isn’t a circumstance compared with his rapidity
in getting away. As a sprinting backslider the
ship’s officer reigns supreme. I’ve sampled him.

The question is always being asked why
not promote District Court Judges to the Supreme
Court Bench ? There is a reason advanced against
it: that once a man reaches a judicial position he
should regard his ambition as fulfilled, and should
learn to expect no more advancement from the
Crown, lest such an expectation should affect his im-
partiality. In short, it is feared that D.C. Judges
might shape their courses to win promotion.

Judkins’ attack on Gillott was first pub-
lished in Truth, and Juddy only talked expur-
gated Truth ; but he told his audience that he
had found it all out himself, and had known about
it for a fortnight. As a matter of fact, the stuff
and the affidavits accompanying it were supplied
by a well-known gambling boss, who offered it to
David Syme (one of Gillott’s best friends) before
it went to Truth.

Victorian Chief Sec. Sam Gillott’s resig-
nation, following on a charge by a John Norton-
Judkins combination that he lent _ money on
mortgage to a Lonsdale-street notoriety, recalls
the remark made bv George Crofts in Bernard
Shaw’s play, “Mrs. Warren’s Profession.” Crofts
is being reviled for holding shares in a syndicate
which runs a series of bagnios throughout Europe,
and retorts: —
Why the devil shouldn’t I invest my money in that way ?
I take the interest on my capital, like other people. I
hope you don’t think I dirty my hands with the work.
Come, you wouldn’t refuse the acquaintance of my mother’s
cousin, the Duke of Belgravia, because some of the rents
he gets are earned in queer ways. You wouldn’t cut
the Archbishop of Canterbury, 1 suppose, be<3ause the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners have a few publicans and
sinners among their tenants. Do you remember your
Crofts scholarship at Newnham ? Well, that was founded
by my brother the M.P. He gets his 22 per cent, out of a
factory with 600 girls in it and not one of them getting
wages enough to live on. How do you suppose most of
them manage? Ask ,\ our mother. And do you suppose
me to turn my back on 35 per cent., w T hen all the rest are
pocketing what they can, like sensible men? No such
fool. If you’re going to pick and choose your aquaint-
ances on moral principles, you’d better clear out of this
country, unless you want to cut yourself out of all
decent society.
By the way, it is not many years ago that Miss
Sutherland, the head of the Melb. Neglected
Children’s Mission, created a sensation by assert-
ing that some very prominent Presbyterian
churchmen, who are also politicians of the most
holy type, were closely connected with the profits
of bagnio property. They still hold their seats,
and Juddy takes good care not to reveal the
doings of those associated with him in his great
“ moral reform movement.”

Vic. Legislative Assembly, in response to
a real demand, passed recently a Bill legalising
marriage with a deceased husband’s brother, a
deceased husband’s nephew, or a deceased wife’s
niece. Marriage with a deceased wife’s sister has
been legal for years, and this proposed the same
with regard to a husband’s brother, and the same
with regard to a relationship a couple of steps
more remote. The reason for the Bill lay in this.
Several such —dozens such—marriages have been
contracted in Victoria, and children been born of
them. By a recent decision of the courts they
have been held to be illegal, and, on the mere
application of either party, can be declared void.
The Bill was therefore humane and sensible. But
the Council rejected it. The Assembly passed it
again, and the Council decided to persist in its
opposition. The refusal is about the most serious
blow to the purity of the home and the sanctity
of the marriage tie that we’ve had in Australia ;
and, appropriately enough, it comes from a Tory
Upper House.

Thos. Victor Brown, who faced Sydney
Bankruptcy Court, the other day, backed an
excellent double to reach that goal; he backed
ponies and ran a theatrical co. —horses and hers.
The man who puts his trust in equine legs generally
stumbles ; when he adds to that folly an interest
in a feminine leg show, his chance of avoiding
disaster is nil.
Zarut Khan, of Lismore (N.S.W.), tried
for the murder of another Mahommedan, had
little cash to pay for legal defence; so one dusky
friend held a picnic. He sent messengers to all
the outlying localities to acquaint Hindus and
Mahommedans that he was giving a “tucker-
feast ” on a most gorgeous scale. They rolled up
in numbers. When he got them in a good humor
he broached the subject, that Zarut Khan was
poor, and on his trial for murder. Over £lOO was
thus collected. But the gentleman was duly
found guilty and sentenced to death.

During the hearing of a Customs case
lately Chief Justice Darley, of N.S.W., spoke
severely re the employment of paid agents to
push business through the Lands and Customs
Departments. His Honor said that the Depart-
ments are open to do public business, and things
should be so organised that the public could do
its business without the aid of outsiders. That is
very good in theory, but what about the law
courts ? If there is anything a member of the
public should get for the asking it is justice.
Supreme Court Judges are paid high salaries, and
supplied with spacious and well-furnished courts
and chambers, that they may administer the
law, but what chance has a common member of
the public to obtain justice unless he employs one
or more of their Honors’ licensed brigands, to place
the case before their Honors exactly as their faddy
Honors think it should be placed ? Very little,
certainly, and unless the applicant pleads dire
poverty, the Judge is very likely to snub him at
the outset, while the brigands who are hanging
around, waiting to be hired, openly jeer under
their horsetails. Lands, Customs, and other
Departments may be in a bad way in the sense of
making it hard for a plain, common man to do
business with them, but the law courts are im-
measurably worse. His Honor’s denunciation of
the land agent and Custom-house agent, when
he hadn’t a word to say against the horse-hairy
spectacle of the law agent right under his nose,
suggests that his Honor has a beam in his eye.

A quaint husband or ex-husband told a
Melbourne court lately that, after being married
for 26 years, he divorced his wife for habitual
drunkenness, thinking that “the shock of it
would cure her.” Finding, however, that divorce
as a drink cure was no good, he took her back
again; but “still she did not mend her ways.”
He was a bold experimentalist, and should have
had better luck.

The attempt to bring the emploj'ees in warehouses
under the operation of the Factories Act is deeply
resented by the softgoods employees in Flinders Lane.
Yesterday afternoon a meeting of representatives of all
the leading warehouses assembled at the Softgoods’
Association rooms. Mr. J. Brown was certain that the
proposal to include them under the Factories Act was
distasteful to every man employed in the Lane. The
next thing would be that they would be compelled to
form a trades union, affiliate with the Trades-hall, and
march in procession behind a banner. Mr. Alfred Moses
suggested a public meeting to protest against it.— Ths

Once I had rosy days ;
Once, in a world remote,

On the ivory gate where the sunrise streams,
And it opened wide ; and I saw my dreams—
A living splendor of rainbow gleams.
Gone that enchanted land,
Lost in the mists of time,
A fancy set to an idle rhyme.
For the gate last night at my lifted hand
Swung wide, and showed me a lonely land ;
Cold stars were there—and the desert sand.

H. Gr. Wells came to grief on the nigger
problem in U.S.A. In Boston (or Tugaskee) he
dined with Du Bois and Washington Booker, the
black professors of learning, who' wear evening
clothes and write sad essays on the future of
Mistah Johnsing. Wells marvelled at the two
colored professors’ philosophical state of mind.
He had gone to America prepared to hear coon
songs yelled from the windows of the black
universities, and he had found culture and chicken
and boiled shirts. Booker advocates higher
education among the negro masses, and free scope
to exercise their unbounded literary and political
genius. Education, he explains, acts like music
on the black mulatto’s soul and fills him with
yearnings for a better kind of cakewalk and fire
escapes—Booker is strong on the nigger’s yearning
for improved fire escapes. Wells pondered over
these facts, took up an armful of ethics, and mixed
them with Du Bois. Also, Wells jibbed at the
common story of the white girl who married a
dark, Italian-like stranger from the south, and
who afterwards gave birth to a progeny of negroid
children. Wells declared that such stories made
him horribly wild and tired, they disarranged his
ethical perspective and created ignorant disorder.
Washington Booker said that higher education
would cure all those things, and make the Ameri-
can coon as white as a sea-washed pebble. Wells’
final conclusions regarding America’s black pro-
blem are misty and indefinite. Like most English-
men from London, he regards the far off mulatto
and octoroon with a half-amused eye. If Wells
and his kind had to rear a nation of white
daughters under the eternal menace of Ham’s
beast eyes, they would forego ethical arguments
and carry guns.

With a view to encouraging constables to

and “For Merit” engraved on it snail be given
to those displaying bravery under dangerous cir-
cumstances. The Bananaland police cannot com-
plain of lack of opportunities to earn this medal,
for there is no State in the Commonwealth in
which X 764 is more likely to find himself face to
face with a loaded firearm, or confronted with a
large, keen knife than Queensland—a state of

A correspondent to Melb. Age on the
City Council kennels for homeless dogs :
The attendants informed me that no money is allowed
for food, so a week’s starvation is added to their sufferings.
In the last two days 15 or 16 dogs have been confined
in a dark iron cage overhanging the water, waiting till
another consignment should be added before drowning
the lot. Maddened by hunger and thirst, tearing and
biting each other, it was a sight to revolt the most har-
dened, and a disgrace to a civilised country.
If that is true Melbourne City Council ought to
be asked to meet in gaol for a fortnight or so on
a limited bread-and-water diet.

A weird fancy was fathered by Graf-Armi-

gress in Melbourne. He is reported to have
said : —“Perhaps the metaphysics of the Chinese,
Japanese, and Hindus—especially the Hindus—
might aid in the better understanding of the
Christian religion, when those nations came into
the Church.” It might. It arouses a conception
of a Heaven where 27 angels of varied hues live
eternally in one room, playing fan-tan with white
cherubs, while a black-and-yellow Peter sits on a
heap of hawkers’ goods and vegetables and yells,
“Banzai!”

“Mixed bathing” on the open beach is

that once made beach-bathing penal after 6 a.m.

The “Soap Trust” bubble in England,

and they’re inordinately proud of the fact. The
Englishman’s home is his castle, and his bath-room

The case of Tuttle versus Tasker, junior,
is a warning to the lady who claims damages for
breach-of-promise not to attempt to prove too
much. Lenore Tuttle sued David Tasker, junior,
for £3OOO, and pleaded that after Tasker had
said “ Will you ?” a bank-manager, a doctor, and
a squatter had proposed to her in turn, and that
she rejected them all because she believed that
David was her very own. The Judge stared, and
a cynical jury became interested. They seemed
to think that one man might have rushed in with
a proposal of marriage without receiving any en-
couragement, but that three should do so struck
them as very remarkable ; and the lady was ques-
tioned as to whether she helped them any
to “bring them up to the point of proposing,”
and as the lady did not satisfactorily explain
away that view of the case, the cynical jury,
without retiring, brought in a verdict for the
defendant.

A note from Villa Rica, in Paraguay,
where the “ New Australia” pilgrims went: —
The colonists in New Australia have been afflicted with
many troubles during the last two years. The revolution
which broke out, and lasted some four months, affected
them, in common with the rest of the country, adversely,
and they are only now commencing to recover from the
effects of it. But the worst of the troubles have been
domestic. One of the colonists murdered his wife and
then committed suicide, and another attempted suicide
by cutting his throat. More recently, another of the
colonists had one of his children killed and his house
robbed during his absence, and another had his house
burned down, as the result of incendiarism, it is sup-
posed. Some of the settlers have left during the last
year, and the number of the colonists, which was on the
increase, has again diminished. At the same time, at the
moment of writing these lines, the outlook is more
hopeful. Some of the colonists are doing fairly well, and
several of them have formed a syndicate, in conjunction
with outsiders, for the erection of a steam sawmill.
From the Cosme colony, founded by the Lane faction,
the news is not, on the whole, very favorable. The num-
ber of settlers has dwindled until only a dozen able-bodied
men remain. One of the colonists informed me that they
did not propose to accept any new members. He says
the colony is now out of debt. They possess a very good
property, and they are going to keep it. They still con-
tinue to work on socialistic principles, though these have
been greatly modified since the start.
Taking both colonies together, I do not know a single
one of the Australians who is really contented, especially
as the cost of living in- Paraguay has increased greatly
since the last revolution.

“O’Fipp”: One can hardly help ob-
serving the preponderance of weird names among
the persons who give patent-medicine testi-
monials. It’s not all accident. When I was
connected with the literary staff of Fullfat’s
Make-You-Laugh Pills we used daily to search
the Scriptures—l mean the directory—for out-
landish names. Anathoth Pebbertrick Duke-
scraye Mussellfoot we knew was always a sure
mark, or Monolitha Myriel Ruatrice. Don’t
know what’s the cause or whether it is merely
coincidence, but strange names like strange
doctors. It’s Bob Smith who pins his faith to the
family medico. Probably the robust hereditary
common-sense that made him Bob and not

THE BRIDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There came to my office a maiden
One day in the long, long ago ;
With gladness her being was laden,
While mine was o’er-burdened with woe.
And she hinted “ Make haste, or you’ll lose me ”
(Her cherry-red lips were apart).
But I answered, “ You’ll kindly excuse me,
For, girlie, I’m plighted to Art.”
So the moon and the stars passed above me,
And Art proved a treacherous bride—
“ Oh, sweetheart of old, come and love me,”
I loud in my loneliness cried.

FOR THE BULLETIN
I HAVE stepped out of fairyland a while,
And taken pause—as women will, you know;
For as the tide, so Life has ebb and flow,
And on my lips is dying Youth’s last smile.
And in my hand I hold with slow regret
A soft thing scented with gold memories,
And tears, unwonted, overflow my eyes—
I close the volume, for its page is wet.
And will he longer love and find me fair ?
And what if he does not ?—I still am I
I throw it from me—nay, I will not cry!
Get thou behind me—thou, my first white hair!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Do not give your heart to me,
I’ve yet no time for wiving ;
Better far to leave me free,
And let me do my striving.
There are other joys to taste ;
I must be up and moving ;
I’d surly be a fool to waste
All my .youth in loving.
Poets sing of Love’s young dreams—
But dreams, alas, are hollow ;
A store of gold is best, it seems,
And then the love will follow.
I’m very busy, on the whole,
And have no time for pleasure ;
I’d love you, truly, heart and soul,
Had I but the leisure.

The funds now consist Of Assurance Fund, £4,478,070,
and an investment fluctuation reserve, £86,408. To the
latter £835 has been added during the year, probably
derived from the sale of securities; in the table this
amount has been added to the income shown in the
published revenue account. So far as increase of business
goes, this society—the second in point of age and size in
Australia—shows very striking figures. In ten years the
income has been doubled. But it has had to fight, and
still has to fight, for most of its business ; and its
expense rate is therefore high (in the following, income is
taken to include the additions to reserve fund): —
Expenses Compared with Total Income.

In the ordinary course of things, there ought to have
been a large reduction in the expense rate calculated on
this basis, because of the large increase of cheaply-handled
renewal premiums. This is a point which, in viewing ex-
pense rates, is often insufficiently stressed. Take the A. M. P.
for instance —one can’t very well escape taking the A.M.P.
when Australian life assurance is on the board. In 1885
that society’s cheaply-collected renewal-premium income
was only about five times greater than the new-premium
income, which cost a good deal to get in. In 1905, twenty
years later, the cheaply-managed renewal-premium in-
come was nearly twelve times greater than the new
premiums. On the basis of total premium income, or
aggregate income (including interest), there should natu-
rally therefore be in this, and in all similar cases, a heavy
fall in expense-rate. But, as a matter of fact, there has
not been any fall do speak of. In many cases, there has
been no fall whatever. Are the managements less effec-
tive than they were in the old, struggling days, before
some of these concerns got very large ideas of themselves,
or is there too much of this blessed competition that we
hear so much aboi.t ?
An arbitrary plan for cutting up life-office
expenses—arbitrary, but endorsed by persons of great
tonnage in the business —is to charge the renewal pre-
miums with 5. per cent, of their total for expenses, then
to charge the consideration paid for annuities with 3 per
cent., and to set the balance of the total expenses against
new business. On that basis in 1885 the A.M.P.’s new
business was being got for 74 per cent, of the first-year
premium income. Last year, on the same basis, the new
business was'costing 112 percent, of the first-year pre-
mium income. In the National Mutual in 1905 the rate
was 121 per cent. ; this year it has been 118 J per cent.
Possibly 5 per cent, is rather too low a figure to charge
for renewal business in Australia. But if 7 per cent, is
charged, the results support the same general conclusions,
especially if the results be set against those of the
Citizens’ and one or two other of the younger offices—
that some of the older offices will have to wake up, that
their cost of new business has increased very much, that
some of the younger and more progressive offices are
getting business at apparently a much smaller cost, and
that the often-published tables of expense ratios, cover-
ing a long series of years, and showing either uniformity
ot a slight reduction, are not nearly as satisfactory as
they look.
Whether the National Mutual should be reck-
oned in with the newer offices it is rather hard to say.
In years it is fairly old, and yet it has (especially of late
years) developed some remarkably progressive ten-
dencies. It will rush after business that others don’t
think in their line. In recent years it has also gone to
S’Africa, and is doing a big business there—at a cheap
rate, it is alleged, though that seems hardly possible.
And, anyhow, we haven’t got the mortality results yet.
Probably the rapid growth of its figures, partly the result
of this S’African business, may influence other business
its way, to the advantage of the expense rate by and
bye; but, after all, recent American experience
has seriously prejudiced this big-figure policy, and
people are beginning to see that what they
want is not a vast procession of figures, but low ex-
penses, high interest-earnings, and favorable mortality ;
and low expenses and a feverish chase for business to the
farthest saltbush in the country—and especially in some
other country—can’t go together. All that can be said
is that, considering its chase, the National Mutual’s
expenses areTvery moderate.
Its interest earnings are unusually high :
Interest Earned on Average Funds.
1899 .. £4 13 0 per cent. 1903 .. £4 13 11 per cent.
1900 .. 4 13 3 „ 1904 .. 4 13 9
1901 .. 4 13 4 „ 1905 .. 4 13 7 „
1902 .. 4 11 7 „ 1906 .. 4 12 8 „
That is 3s. per cent, higher than the A.M.P.’g average
last year, and it would be still higher if the National
Mutual did not charge direct against interest (rent) some
property rates and taxes. It is over ss. higher than the
Citizens’ rate. But, then, no less than 49 per cent, of its
funds are on mortgage, while only 5 - 3 are in public
securities ; whereas mortgages total 43 - 5 per cent., and
public securities 26 - 6 per cent, in the A.M.P., and in the
Citizens’ mortgages represent only 38 per cent, while
public securities stand for 33-3 per cent. The question
is whether the extra risk and expense of mortgages are
not worth more than the extra money. Instead of
increasing its Government securities, the National
Mutual has actually reduced them ; though the amount
of “ cash in hand and on current account ” has
increased very much indeed. That seems curious finance
—to get rid of what is bringing in money and to accumu-
late what presumably is earning nothing—but it is
probably explainable. Anyhow, this piling up of money
on mortgage and in securities other than public stocks
means that the management is accepting a very great
responsibility indeed. It is to be hoped those concerned
realise the size of it.

The extra 5 per cent, for the past year is by way of
bonus, and that, perhaps, may be taken as an intimation
that it will not be repeated. It certainly ought not to
be, even if profits keep to their recent high level. The
distribution allows of a lay-by of only 22 per cent, of the
profits ; and especially in a small concern like this,
where no single year’s results can be accepted as a
criterion, far more than that ought to be laid aside in an
unusually'favorable year. The average of the dividends
his been too high ; in the past 10 years only £9324 has
been laid by against the conflagration hazard that every
fire insurance co. must prepare to face. Naturally, as a
result, business has not increased —the public turns
rather to the offices which offer it the best protection by
the largest addition to reserves. The following shows
recent movements (only from 1898 have detailed figures
been published)

The interest earnings are apparently moderate. Fixed
deposits, which carry interest, and agency balances,
which don’t as a rule, are lumped ; and that does not
allow the earnings of actual investments to be ascer-
tained ; but on the mean of all assets, the return shows
£3 12s. 6d. p.c. It would be more, of course, on the
actual investments ; but they can’t be ascertained. It cer-
tainly ought to be more ; for of the total assets (£132,159)
no less than £82,988 is tied up in mortgages and accrued
interest. A perfect balance-sheet, by the way, would
separate these latter two items. If the banks and build-
ing societies had separated them about 15 years ago there
wouldn’t have been the disastrous smashes that there
were, because then it would have been obvious that the
high interest earnings, on the strength of which the dizzy
dividends were paid, weren’t coming in at all —they were
simply being tacked on to the advances.

It is simply impossible to take very seriously statements
which show profits of £2402 one year, £2403 the next,
and so on, just enough to pay the dividend. Going back
to the end of 1898, when this remarkable run began, it
will be found that money lent on mortgage was £29,009,
and foreclosed properties stood at £13,803 ; total, £42,812.
Money lent on mortgage is now £5070; foreclosures,
£13,165 ; tota , £18,225. The £24,000 or thereabouts thus
raised has been put into office-premises. Question is,
how has it been raised ? Has the co. got 20s. in the £, or
has it only got 155., and made the other ss. up out
of profits which have not been disclosed in the accounts?
Anyhow, these two items, dating from the boom
years, have been reduced from £42,000 to about £lB,OOO ;
and the chances are that they have been partly reduced
out of current profits. What sort of an investment the
new premises are (they cost £41,600, and £lB,OOO
is owing on them) it is impossible to say, owing
to the habit the co. has of lumping all its receipts
“after providing for contingencies.” Also, the
size of the trustee business isn’t hinted at. Salaries,
fees, and office expenses in 1898 were £3892 ;
last year they were £5995. That increase oupht to
mean a much larger increase in business and profits than
the published figures show. The practical question is
how much more writing down is to be done, and how
much more of the current profits must be “socked”
away ? The jump in the disclosed profits this year may be
a hint that the sink is about full. Office expenditure isn’t
by any means a sure guide to profits ; but the Trustees,
Executors and Agency Co., also of Melbourne, last half-
year, on an outlay of £5895, made a profit of £5466 ; the
National’s outlay (for the year) was £s99s—excluding
office rent in both cases. The National certainly ought
to be showing better profit figures presently.

In the published accounts, £20,000 of the profit is applied
to the reduction of Accumulated Assets Depreciation
Account. This really means that the £20,000, like the
balance of the undivided profit, has gone in reduction
of the deficit set out above; and it is shown so
in the table. Prior to 1901 the co., when it cut
down a tree and sold it, regarded the pro-
ceeds (less expenses) as profit, though obviously
part of it was capital. By 1901 this utterly wrong
process had resulted in the removal of £264,920
(book value) of timber—there was a gaping hole of that
size on the assets side of the balance-sheet. Since
1901 some part of the annual profits has been
applied to the writing-down of the wasting securities.
But as other assets are lumped with forests, and pur-
chases (or sales) of those other assets may be made, it is
impossible to tell what the extent of this provision is.
Here, however, is a comparison which may throw some
light on the matter
1899. 1901. 1905. 1906.
Debenture debt .. £277,292 £249,462 £163,753 £127,453

Leases, Forests,

Liquid assets .. 111,930 148,342 132,707 143,061
Or we can get this comparison :
1901. 1906.
Liabilities, including debentures.. £327,610 £195,191
Liquid assets .. .. .. 148,342 143,061
Deficit .. £179,268 £52,130
This means an improvement of £127,138 in the cash
position in five years, after paying dividend. Whether
that more than counterbalances the real depreciation in
the value of the forests, etc., it is impossible to tell.
Apparently large sums have also been put into fixed
property; thus, whereas in 1903 forests, mills, &c., were
valued at £481,164, in 1904 they were valued at £548,672 ;
and possibly the £67,608 by which these assets were in-
creased was paid with cash ; on the other hand, all or part
of it may have been written up on revaluation. From
its very nature, it is very hard to tell from the figures
what the real position of the business is; all that can be
said for certain is that in five years there has been a fine
improvement in the cash position to counterbalance the
destruction of assets, and possibly, also, large additions
have been made to the fixed assets out of cash receipts.
The paid capital is £585,000 (150,000 shares paid to 335.,
and 450,000 shares paid to 155.).

Though in the directors’ report for 1905 no appropri tion
for the benefit of terminating shares was provided for,
the present accounts show that the us al payment was
made ; the figures for 1905 in the table therefore differ to
a slight extent from those printed 12 months ago. The
business continues to grow rapidly :

“ Interest earned,” no doubt, includes profits on sales, if
any ; and this may account for some of the remarkable
increase in earnings. The risks have increased very
largely, too. In five years deposits, &c., have gone from
£74,334 to £191,451; and shareholders funds J?*™
to stand the racket of any slump m the sepnntaes
into which that money has been put. Jive years
ago shareholders’ funds (capital and reserve) had
to protect only £183,753 worth of non-liquid assets, now
they have to protect £305,064 Worth. Still, ludgpng only
by the interest return, the present assets should cause
less anxiety than those of a few years back ; though,
unfortunately, the ability of the public to pay even a
high rate of interest in times of prosperity doesn t
always mean that the property is really worth at
ordinary times what the public formerly paid the large
interest upon. In other words, high interest-earnings
on such securities in times of boom or prosperity are not
a safe guide to the real value of the securities. Yet
directors too often think they are, and run up their
dividends accordingly. The present situation calls,
rather, for large reserves ; and this society will be doing*
very well indeed if it keeps the dividend where it is.

This co. sells land on time payment, and assists persons
to build. How any transaction will pan out it therefore
takes some years to tell. Apparently, in order to meet
possible losses, in addition to disclosed reserves there is
a suspense account, or inner reserve; but its extent is
unknown. The principal movements, so far as the
accounts disclose them, during the past few years have
been :

Other assets .. 154 1,729 1,551 1,171
The solitary item on the revenue side of the profit and
loss account is “ profit on transactions ”; and that
doesn’t give much information. The co. may have taken
credit for all the profit shown on paper by the large trans-
actions of the past two years, or a large proportion of
that possible profit may have been hidden in the sus-
pense account, to be taken credit for later on if things
turn out all right. All that is very sure from the pub-
lished accounts is that the business has extended
rapidly, and that it hasn’t been accompanied by any
recent rapid growth in liabilities. In two years pur-
chasers’ balances, advances, &c., have increased by nearly
£19,000, while freeholds, &c., have only been cut into by
£7672; and meantime deposits and other debts have
remained almost stationary. The effect of this is that,
after paying dividend, £7672 of the property on the
books two years ago has been exchanged for nearly
£l9*ooo of other assets. Of course, the transactions have
been larger than that; but that is the final result. And
a very cheerful result it is.

The figures in the last line (other than those as to profits
and the rate of dividend) are estimates. The profits
shown above are net—that is, after deductions for depreci-
ation. In 1905 the writing-off amounted to £1350 ;in the
past year it amounted to only £419, which accounts for
most of the improvement shown in net profits. Still,
in the matter of gross profit there has been a steady
improvement, too 1904, £3431 ; 1905, £3474 ; 1906, £3946.
Of the reserves £19,757 is a contingency account to
provide against “ > robable losses.” It just depends
upon how probable the losses are whether this is a real
reserve or not. The interest-bearing assets on the average
brought in almost exactly 6 per cent., which certainly
isn’t very high for a building society. On the other
hand, of its assets £136,360 is represented by advances,
and only £14,161 by real estate, apart from office pre-
mises, so there is no heavy dead-weight of foreclosures.
The deposits total £95,577, as against £88,240 in 1905 and
£86,400 in 1904, and the society doesn't seem to have
much use for the money ; at any rate, it has most of the
new money in hand —which isn’t altogether a disadvan-
tage, for the cash reserves were until lately extremely
small. The working expenses are very moderate—for the
first time they have been got just under 1 per cent,
of the advances and other non-liquid assets ; and as the de-
posits cost something over 4 per cent., there is a shade under
a modest i per cent, on deposits as profit and to provide
for losses on securities. It is cutting things pretty fine ;
but, then, that is how they make their profits at Bendigo
—that way, and by sticking to the things they know.
This society, for instance, has just lost a director
(Darnton Watson’ who had been a director for 24 years ;
and two of the others, W. O. Vahland and Jacob Cohn,
were on the board along with the late “ Bobby ”
Burrowes when the society was founded in 1865—41 years
ago. That is how they keep out losses, and make a 1 per
cent, margin go a long way—they get the right men and
hang on to them for 41 years.

The only explanation that can be got out of the accounts
for this remarkable fall in profits is that the “ balance of
the trading account ” was only £17,572 as against £31,437
in the previous half-year ; but, as no trading or working
account is published, there is no visible reason why
trading profits should have been cut down by nearly 50
per cent, in six months. Evidently, however, business
has really shrunk very considerably, for freight and
cartage amounted to oaly £1950 as against £3253 in the
preceding six months; and, though in the March-
September part of the year the Westfalian thirst is
never at its best, yet even in that part of 1905
freight and cartage ran to £2157, and in the
same part of 1904 they swamped £2241. It may be only
a temporary set-back ; but the general trend of the
figures certainly isn’t cheerful. And the fact that the
biggest item in the balance-sheet (hotel properties,
£165,409) is in there at cost doesn’t make the situation
more cheerful. The hotels may be worth all this money
—just as the brewery lands and buildings may also be
worth what they cost the co. back in the beginning—but
if the Westralian beer-trade falls off, or if this co.’s beer
trade falls off, there will soon begin to be doubts about it.
Brisbane Permanent Building and Banking
Co., whose position was reviewed in B. 15/11/’O6, has
practically decided upon a scheme for cleaning-up the
concern. As the assets returned only £5 9s. per cent,
gross last year, and as no dividend at all has been pos-
sible the last two years, there was obvious need of further
writing-down. There are rather less than 150,000 shares,
two-thirds of them paid to £l, the balance paid to 3s. 6d.
The idea is to write 3s. 6d. off all-round, which will allow
of an average of about 50 per cent, coming off unim-
proved and 25 per cent, off improved properties in pos-
session ; and a trifle will be left over to add to reserves.
But, instead of adding anything to reserves in this
way, it might be better to write off only 35., and so leave
contributing shares paid to 6d., in order to keep them
alive.

No sooner had the prospector who started the
Poseidon rush at Tarnagulla (Vic.) on Cup-day bottomed on
gold than the grab-alls of the neighborhood reached out
for a big slice in the rush. A syndicate was formed, in-
cluding some of the luckiest of the diggers and the
tradespeople of Tarnagulla. They theorised thus about the
lead. “Ifit is going to be any good to us,” they' said, “it
will be because the narrow lead being worked junctions with
the main gutter somewhere. We want to get the junction.”
They followed the lead along 4 , and pegged a 10-acre block
in the likeliest looking spot. Then they bored it, and
announced that it was wet ground. The rush had been
growing all this time, and the last 200 or 300 men had not
been able to get claims. Why ? Because the syndicate
had monopolised the possibilities. There, .were rows.
The miners said that the ground was not wet, and,
of course, if it were dry, under Victorian law it
must be pegged out in claims—42ft. or 60ft. square —
and not grabbed by a syndicate. The working miners
clamored for claims. They got an injunction from the
Warden, and finally a decision that the ground was dry,
and the syndicate must “get.” It was while this row
was on that some of the men tried to jump the big gold-
yielding claims, including the prospector’s claim (but this
had to be given up again). This was done because the pros-
pector was one of the syndicate, and the men reckoned
that a man who was getting a hatful of nuggets a day
out of one claim ought to be satisfied and not want
others. Melb. Argus, however, always on the side of
the grabber, says that “such a violation of all the prin-
ciples of diggers’ honor as the jumping of the prospector’s
claim —the man who found the rush for all of them —
would not be tolerated by the men on fields in other
parts of the world.” But neither would a syndicate
that tried to grab 10 acres of diggers’ ground be tolerated
on any other field.

One more Victorian deep-lead float has been
engineered in London. Lately it was the Moolort end of
the Berry lead. Now the Kingston end has its turn, and
there isn’t a happier man than A. J. Peacock in Creswick.
Claims interested are the Berry United, which has a
shaft and a pump ; the Great Berry, which has a few
bores and a lot of dead heads ; and t: e Kingston Leads,
which hasn’t got any of these things. The same Com-
monwealth Trust engineers the amalgamation as had a
finger in the Moolort reconstruction pie; and it seems
less inclined to grab than is usual with Bull when
mining floats are on. Maybe the Trust has
such a load of alluvial scrip that it is near-
ing the Plimsoll mark. New co. is to have, 250,000
£1 shares. Berry United gets 60,000, Great Berry 15,000,
and the Kingston Leads 26,000. The Kingston Leads is
the Commonwealth Trust, which guarantees an issue of
50,000 ; it takes the call of 50,000 more shares, and the
right to take up all the shares left from the 50,000 to be
offered to the public. New show, therefore, starts with
£50,000 in hard cash ; if the public bites and goes for the
whole 50,000 of the public issue, there will be £lOO,OOO
capital, and if the market is favorable the balance of the
scrip will no doubt be planted. “ Ifs ” figure up well in
this ; but when a crowd can galvanise into life the market
over the dead ends at Moolort, it ought to be an easy job
to get cash for the shallower ground in Creswick field.
What the Long Tunnel Co. (Vic.) wants to-day
is a stout heart, like that of Peter Finlay son, of the Ex-
tended. The directors look as dejected as a dog with a
crushed tail. Some go with their heads down, others
walk on the quiet side of the street, and others keep out
of the way'. No doubt it is hard luck strike a blank
in the bottom level. But think how much'worse it. would
have been had there been no south stone to come and go
on ! Quartz, even there, is, no doubt, getting
short, but the co. has a substantial cash reserve
and it has more than one shot in the locker,
thanks both to the south stone and to that in the north-
west ground—whatever the latter may be worth. Two
theories are stated to account for the lode not being cut
in No. 26 crosscut—(l) it does not live down ; (2) it has
gone back on to the main dyke. As to the first, the work
done in the old north-west workings at No. 23 level proved
a disturbance. Otherwise the lode would not have
left the dyke as it did at No. 22, The fact
that the Extended has a solid reef up to the Long Tunnel
boundary at its No. 26 level, whereas there is no reef
130 ft. further north, looks like corroborative evidence of
this. No one seems to know whether the reef at the
Extended No 26 level is against the dyke—a bit of
evidence that would be of great importance to the Tunnel.
But the fact remains that the reef has lived down in the
one mine to 2600 ft., so why should it cut out in the other?
There is, then, the hypothesis that the reef may be on
the main dyke. Crosscutting will prove this. If it is
there and ft carries gold, the Long Tunnel at present
rates is a soft market snap. So it is worth a try to pick
it up, the inducement being that, for a couple of thousand
feet, the reef lived alongside the dyke. The co. needs to
sink a winze from the 2400 ft. level to follow the tone
down ; it ought to rush out its No. 26 crosscut to the
west to settle if the reef has gone on to the dyke, and it
ought to hasten on sinking to try' the state of affairs at
still greater depth. * *
Samuel Bartlett, Samuel Bartlett, where art
thou ! Turn to your report as mine manager of the
South New Moon for the half-year ended May 31. Then
read: “ Although the quartz returns have not been as
good as in some of the previous half-years,- I confidently
expect the mine to pay dividends for a considerable time.”
Set against this what William Westhead, your successor,
said recently : “ I think the mine all right. We can ex-
pect dividends now and again, but I do not think the
prospects of the mine justify the expectations of yields
such as the co. has had in the past.” Less than a
month after this last statement was made, out comes
the half-yearly report, which, saying little, tells much.
The best of the stone came from the New Moon end of
the claim, between 900 ft. and 1100 ft. Very little stone is
now left there, but south there is plenty of quartz,
though not the old loz. dirt which allowed of the big
divs., until a total of £l3 13s. (fatal numbers !) had been
put up. Oo.’s costs were 14s. 7£d. per ton last half-year,
but no sinking was done. This duty is ahead ; and,
judging by work in the Clarence, a big sink may be
needed. To face the expenditure and pay the occasional
divs. of which Westhead speaks, there is the stone left in
the upper levels and £6OOO reserve. This is a paltry sum
to have in hand when over £400,000 has gone out of the
mine into the pockets of shareholders. Still, it is Ben-
digo all over. Divs. one year, calls the next. South New
Moon may not be so near the margin as that, but if
development is vigorous and luck bad for a while it will
be a tight squeeze to avoid calls.

Stannary Hills, the Adelaide-owned N.Q. tin
mine, shows a respectable profit for the first time since it
started out on its expensive course, nearly six years ago.
Of the previous accumulated deficit of £35,755, the half-
year’s work wipes out £14,850 —£13,443 from the mine,
and £1407 from the railway. This is after paying deben-
ture-stock interest (£2784). The previous half-year
showed a loss of £2156. In neither case has anything
been charged for depreciation. The gilt is, however, off
the gingerbread ; and though there is a vague report
about good ore at a depth, the fine-tin contents of the
ore treated have fallen this way in tbe past four years :
3-30 per cent., 2-19 per cent., 1'66 per cent.,
I*4 per cent. There was 256 tons fine tin in
the concentrates ; therefore, the mining profit of
£13,443 was equal to £52 10s. 3d. per ton. The
average price of tin for the six months was
£lBO 175.; so costs and charges ran to £l2B 7s. per ten.

rise • for although £35,432 was paid in the six months in
dividends and dfv. tax, only £19 ; 393 was earned without
ehartrintr anything for depreciation, but after paying ior
development (£4219). But, along with the “
Tack’s reDort was issued ; and the text of it snoweuup
better than the precis published a earlier. As t
precis showed, Jack measured up 23,600 tons of ore m
sie-ht” eaual to 17j months supply at the rate oi
recent extraction. But, as The Bulletin has pointed
out several times, it , was
ore in sisrht in a mine which had been too ousy
taking ore out to do development work ; and Dr. Jack
adds such remarks as these:-“ Have not attempted
to estimate the amount of even highly.
but I anticipate that large _ quantities to be
rlfivploned ” * and m iny opinion, at the Holt, level, nuu
quite one-third of the main ore body has been disclosed
and at the 150 ft. level a mere fragment of it is jet
known.” Also, there is “the certainty of the main ore
body extending below the 150 f . level,’ while outside the
main ore body there are “ great possibles of the dis-
coverv of new ore bodies.” There will be no dividends
for perhaps three months ; meantime, however, important
work will proceed at surface and underground, and, w ith
ordinary luck, the mine should again start off in April on
a good course of dividend-paying. On Sept. 30—the date
to which the accounts were made up—there was a sur-
plus of about £15,000 of liquid asset , a P a rt £r omcoke
and stores, and, even if the later dividends cut into that
a bit, there is still enough to put the mine into the state
in which general manager Shepherd wants to see it.
Phoenician Mount, a recently-floated concern,
to work old tin deposits near Oooktown (N.Q.), publishes
a remarkable report from the manager, oonduding . i
can put on to-morrow, if necessary, from 30 to 40 men on
payable ore that won’t crush less all round than from 15
to 20 per cent.” This is tall talk. But there is even
taller; for 40 to 50 per cent, stuff is scattered through
the remarks. Under the circumstances, what is the
market doing at 4s. 6d. ? It is more remarkable still that
the claim (Mt. Amos of old) should have previously been
abandoned. Both Dr. Jack and W. E. Cameron, of the
Queensland Geological Survey, have reported on it—one
in 1891, the other recently. Jack said that the richer
pipes had been worked out—presumably that must have
been the 70 or 90 per cent. ore. Said Cameron re what is
now the Phoenician—“ The lodes occur in granite country
close to its contact with a mass of slates and quartzites.
The lodes crop out as irregular patches of tourmaline
and quartz. They are, no doubt, the result of alteration
of the granite walls at the joints by mineralising vapors
introduced from below during the consolidation of the
margin of the granite mass in cooling.... A small heap
of ore stacked on the surface gave, on being sampled, no
return of tin." Also, “patches of coarsely crystalline
cassiterite occur along the hanging wall, but a sample
taken right across the face gave no return of tin wnen
assayed at the Government Chemical Laboratory. Other
places gave “ good prospects.” Cameron concludes.
“ Judging from the exposures as yet made, some good
patches of ore may be expected, but it is extremely
doubtful whether the lodes are capable of turning out
any large quantity of crushing stuff.” In the face of
that, there is this manager’s report about 60 p.c. ore, and
room for 40 men on 15 to 20 p.c. stuff. It seems up to
the co. to ask the manager to submit some of his 50 p. c. ore.

Manager MacEeod, of the Brilliant Extended,
Charters Towers, is putting up a good light against
costs. These, until recently, got away with almost all
the gold. Two and a-half years ago they stood at 445. ;
then, half-year by half-year, they were 535. 4d., 475.,
425. 2d., 395. 7d. Now they are down to 345. 6d., with a
further reduction promised when the mill engine and other
surface improvements are complete. Surface improve-
ments mentioned will take the stone from the two shafts
to the mill on an aerial tramway. They cart it in drays
at present. Also, there is a large pit for the residues, so
that the tailings, after draining, can be handled by the
cyanide plant without dray-haulage. Total quantity
crushed for the half-year was 27,796 tons for £71,515.
Output increased some 6000 tons on the previous
term’s total, but the value per ton fell from £2 18s. 2d.
to £2 11s. Bd. Previous six months the ore reserves were
estimated at 40,000 tons in the western ground and 70,000
tons on the eastern side, worth £2 10s. and £4 per ton
respectively. These values have not been maintained ;
neither has the quantity of stone in reserve, for the total
is down to 90,000 tons, in spite of 2580 ft. of develop-
ment. The manager points out that the mine has not
been sampled ; values have been estimated from assays
and mill returns. After the co. has paid two divs. of Is.
each in the six months (with tax, £26,250), and after
writing off from plant £2410 (equal to 5 per cent.) for
depreciation, there is left £6990 to carry on.^
Things are only middling with the Queen Cross,
Charters Towers, although the market is toeing the
line, ready for a flutter at any time. Down at the 1700 ft.
formation (vertical depth) a crosscut was put in 130 ft.,
and met the leader that the straight shaft passed through
at 1633 ft. Levels have been driven out north 276 ft., and
south 117 ft. The north drive has a streak of stone along
it most of the way. An improved make has come in
lately, so a trial parcel of 131 tons was got out, and it
returned 235. 6d. per ton. This is the reef that the Queen
Central is preparing to deepen its old shaft to get. The
level that the 235. 6d.-per-ton stuff came from is only
120 ft. from the Queen Central shaft. The south drive is
carrying' 6in. of stone —good white quartz, suitable for
decorating graveyards. An underlay is down 170 ft. Two
other levels are out north and south about 100 ft. below
the No. 1 levels. A winze going down to connect the
levels shows up to 18in. of stone, worth 255. per ton.
Both quality and quantity will have to improve
considerably before the Cross is heard from.
Stone going 255. per ton is no good to a co.
whose costs dodge around £3 ss. per ton for the
half-year. The output for the six months amounted to
6040 tons, that returned 59000 z. gold, worth £18,920.
Concentrates (198 tons) sold for £3272, and residues
brought £Bl5 ; total, £23,008, equal to £3 16s. 2d. per
ton. Expenditure ran to £19,667. The top ground,
where the former dividends came from, is about played
out. Two levels going into the eastern ground have
proved that no stone lives to within 300 ft. of the Vesuvius
shaft, and as that shaft was never suspected of concealing
a reef, further attention is to be paid to the deep ground.
The Victoria and Caledonia Block, some 7Coft. from the
Gross, has found an Bin. reef at 1650 ft. To get this the
Cross will have to deepen its straight shaft.
At Gvmpie (Q.) during November 23,901 tons
were crushed for 14,8470 z. gold ; £13,800 was paid in
dividends, and calls amounted to £5564. These figures
correspond very nearly with those of Nov. last year.
Chief producers were:—Scottish Gympie, 8200 tons for
40750 z., or 9dwt. 22gr. per ton ; No. 2 S. Great Eastern,
10,425 tons for 33490 z., and 7520 z. from plates, or a shade
over 6dwt. per ton ; No. 2 N. Columbia Smithfield, 14-
tons for 14230 z., or lOoz. per ton ; S. Glanmire and Monk-
land, 1412 tons for 1174 oz„ or 10dwt., which is a greatly
improved value ; No. 1 N. Smithfield, 776 tons for 9760 z. ;
Oriental and Glanmire, 227 tons for 868 oz. Dividends were:
No. 2 N. Columbia and Smithfield, 2s. (£4800); No. 2 S.
Great Eastern, the quarterly 6d. (£3600) ;S. Glanmire and
Monkland, 6d. (£3000); No. 1 N. Smithfield, Is. (£2400).
New Dawn, at the south end of the field, has met with black
slate country in the south drive. The country is rather
broken, but developments, which will be watched with
interest, may be of great importance. The Great
Northern, at the Two Mile or north end of the held, is
pushing ahead; sinking is suspended at 9oft. till
machinery is completed—say, Christmas week. Govern-
ment has granted £l5OO to help sink the shaft to 600 ft.
This news was received with great satisfaction in Gympie.
The subsidy is also important, for it means that Govt.
Geologist Dunstan is satisfied that the co. has fair
prospects. * * *
The agitation for a State smelter in North
Queensland assumes shape, and the Waverley Association
is seeking the co-operation of Chambers of Commerce,
Shire Councils, Rabbin Boards, and Tick Committees.
The Bulletin cannot say off-hand whether a State
smelter in the Townsville district would fail, but
the Waverley Association ought to first get a guarantee
from nearly all the small producers in the.district, and as
many large ones as possible, that they will send a certain
tonnage to the smelter if it is erected. The Tick Com-
mittees have no copper ore, and the mines worked by
Chambers of Commerce don’t amount to much, and
Shire Councils only go a few pennyweights to the
ton, so they’re not worth considering. As soon
as the Waverley people have a definite tonnage of
ore assured, they may look round and decide the
cost of fuel, fluxes and labor, and when all that is de-
termined and they can prove without errors in arithmetic
that the State won’t lose much over the venture, the
proposition may be submitted to Premier Kidston with
some confidence. A smelter, as the S. Aus. Government
found out, isn’t like a battery—it has to be kept going
practically continuously, or it is rtiinous. You can t run it
on the one-shift system. The S. Aus. Government lost
three-fourths of all that its State smelter cost—it didn t
get back ss. in the £ of the outlay, and the miners got no
benefit from it. In short, it built first and figured after-
wards, just as they want to do now in N.Q.
Carrington’s Lion, outside of Charters Towers,
has come with a rush. The long-suffering public, who
slipped in at 9s. and out again at Is. 6d., is prepared to
say that it can smell something. Crushings from the
mine have, until recently, been returning between 30s.
and 40s. per ton. Now, when the market is bare
of scrip, returns have exceeded 60s. per ton, with sales
at 7s. 6d. Carrington’s Lion has swallowed the other

Still another year passes and ordinary shares in
the Sulphide Corporation get no dividend— they have
had nothing for six years. There are too many bitesi to
be taken out before it conies to their turn, and the
management is too much in the hands of the preference
people. Co.’s new concentrating mill at the Central
mine, Broken Hill, is about ready : Card tables have been
installed, after a long series of teste. #
The Sulphide Corporation for four weeks pro-
duced 4582 tons zinc concentrates from 12,738 tons tail-
ings. At Cockle Creek 366 tons zinc concentrates were
smelted for 99 tons spelter. Nearly 27 units of metallic
zinc were recovered per ton of concentrates, so that with
spelter at £2B, a ton of concentrates is nominally worth
over £7, and a ton of tailings about £2 10s. This seems
to leave a tremendous margin on the price the companies
get for tailings (from 3s. 6d. to 65.). But it is certa,in
that local returning charges (smelting, &c.) at Cockle
Creek are higher on zinc ore than they are on lead ore,
and on lead ore they are £5 4s. lid. (B. 20/9/ 06). Even
at £5 ss. there would be only £1 15s. per ton of concen-
trates, or under 13s. per ton of tailings, left to cover
costs on the mine and provide profits. Silver and lead
residues are obtained as by-products in smelting zinc
concentrates, and that helps the situation. H it didn t,
the zinc outlook would be mighty poor.
The management of the British, Broken Hill,
-has some eaborate ideas about the development
of the Block 15 (or main) workings, which are respond-
ing tamely to development work. A drive north from
Howell shaft at the 800 ft. level, already in over 400 ft., is
to be extended to connect with Thompson shaft, which
is at present 300 ft. deep. This will mean another 400 ft.
of driving. The whole of the country east of the line
passing through Howell, Thompson and King shafts will
then be tested for ore shoots, whose existence is firmly
believed in by many practical men. King shaft, which
is on the Junction lease, about a dozen feet from
the British boundary, will probably become the pro-
perty of the British, and from it the sulphide lode
cut at 300 ft., and which is underlying into the British,
will be worked. There is no certainty, however, that
this boundary lode will remain in British territory, as
the other bodies in the Junction have had an easterly
underlay in the upper levels, and resume their true wes-
terly angle on reaching the 600 ft. or 700 ft. levels.

A good suggestion has teen made that the
several struggling mines which form the White Leads
group should amalgamate. There are half-a-dozen
from the New A.B.H. Consols to the New
White Leads South, and it will be half-a-dozen years
before the lot of them can produce enough ore to keep one
decent mill going. The New A.B.H. Consols is certainly
strutting round a bit because it is putting up an anti-
quated arrangement that once did service as a mill at the
old Consols mine ; so probably its haughty English direc-
tors couldn’t think of linking hands with the small fry
that are nibbling at the southern stretch of the White
Leads line. Still, the other five are closely enough con-
nected to arrive at an understanding without much diffi-
culty. A railway has already been surveyed, and the
next thing is to get a line of pipes laid from the water
company’s main at the South Blocks. Then a mill could
be erected—and, if the price of lead keeps above £l7 for
the next four or five years, the group might give share-
holders some return for their money.

“ Stannifer ” : The man from Tingha (B.
6/12/’O6) is scarcely logical in his condemnation of port-
able dredging plants for the recovery of tin. A floating
dredge cannot pay where there is no tin ; and if a port-
able plant is erected on unprofitable ground there is at
least a saving of several hundred pounds in dispensing
with the barge. The portable works cheaply* and effec-
tively, and in the Stanthorpe district (Q.), where several
of the deposits are shallow, limited and separated by
rock bars over which no barge can be floated, it must
come into favor, as, although small in extent, the gravels
are fairly "rich, and well worth the erection of this class
of machinery. -Tingha may have got, into bad hands,
but that is no argument against the portable dredge.

The November gold yield of "W.A. was
146,1550 z., against 163,2480 z. for November, ’O5. This
brings the total production for the year to 1,648,1690 z.,
against 1,793,2240 z. for the same period of 1905, making
a.shortage of 145,0550 z. The total shortage for the year
will be about 160,0000 z.

Abbot the Mararoa, Norseman (W.A.), and the
Princess "Royal Central’s option :—“ There seems little
doubt about-the option being exercised, as already there
is enough ore in sight to pay the price and show substan-
tial profit. The co. had to pay £7OOO for the mine,*of
which £lOOO was paid down for six months’ option ;
another £lOOO is due January 10th for a further six
months’ option; balance (£5000) need not be paid
until July 10th next. At present, consulting engineer
Henderson says there is 20,000 tons of ore in sight, worth
£20,000 net profit if the co. gets its own battery, and the
directors will authorise him to secure a 10-head battery
now lying on Norseman Gold Mines, half a mile away.
Total cost of purchase, removal arid erection on Mararoa
will not exceed £2OOO, and Henderson estimates saving
10s. per ton by the co. treating- ore itself. Shaft is to be
immediately sunk another 100 ft. As regards finance, 6d
call this month provides £lOOO for extension of option
referred to above ; proceeds of gold from present crush-
ing will ease matters, and the eo. should pay its own way
with very moderate calls. Directors, however, will not
let mine sutler for want of sufficient capital to propel y
equip and develop it. Henderson says he can have
10-head battery erected in five weeks, and also have shaft
down another 100 ft. in same time. Owing to what the
co. regards as excessive charges at Government battery,
co. will cease crushing there when present parcel is
through. This will probably mean a few more calls, but
if developments are as good 100 ft. deeper as at present
bottom level s the mine, holds out. great possibilities.
The crushing referred to gave 2050 z. from 350 tons, with
sands worth £1 3s. 2d. per ton and slimes £1 6s. ; total
£1054, equal to 60s. per ton.

Kalgurli (W.A.) is giving holders of scrip a
good run for their money, and manager Moss and his
underground boss deserve credit for making such a
success of what at one time looked an almost hopeless
proposition. Up to about 1898 the show and the tieat-
ment plant were alike failures, and the co. had to issue
20,000 fresh shares to raise the wind. Since Moss took
charge, the co. has never looked back, and, in Jan., u ,
paid its first div, of 2s. 6d. per share ; and, as a crowning
success, a distribution of is. Cd. per share and- ss. bonus
for the year ending July 31 is announced. Co. is now
earning profits at the rate of over 200 per cent,
per annum on paid capital, and, even at ruling
rates, shares are a fair gamble. The mam shaft
proves that the ore lenses continue at depth ; and, as
these run about 200 ft. long and 100 ft. wide, they yield a
great quantity of ore. The average recoverable value is
about 60s. a ton. One cannot see ahead of the pick, but,
at present, there should be four years’ ore in sight, and
that, on recent figures, would mean a profit of 1525. oci.
per share. Moss, by the way, is pretty well the only
manager whose estimates of ore-reserve values have been
confirmed by results.

Fairplay, Kalgoorlie, north of the Hidden
Secret, may shortly blossom into a co. with Bull capital.
An amalgamation is talked of, including' the Golde
Group and Bonnie Play, and these would form a P*°'
raising holding. The Fairplay is down 100 ft., and has
treated several hundred tons for an average of 2oz. 1
Golden Group has a large low-grade lode, which has paid
more than wages.

Oroya-Brown Hill, Kalgoorlie, is to reduce its
monthly output to 11,000 tons, worth 88s. per ton, or
£48,500. Costs have recently been about 255., and this
should leave a profit of 635., or £34,750 a month. After
deducting 10 per cent, for income and div. tax, and also
London exes, and depreciation, the net profit is reduced
to perilously near the £360,000 required to maintain the
4s. quarterly div. ; so any further drop in values will
mean a drop in divs. The developments during the past
year have been so very disappointing that the giade of
ore treated has falling from 107 s. to 88s., a shrinkage of
nearly 18 per cent. The rich patch in the north end of
the Oroya shoot is being gradually depleted, andtie
south end of that shoot, as well as the lode in the Oroya
South block, is of much lower grade. The mine may last
along time as a low-grade proposition, but cannot letai
its position as the boss div.-earner of W. A., th< mgh has
still a long way to fall to get down to the Great Boulder,
second on the list.
* * * *
North End, Kalgoorlie, during Nov. treated
1100 tons for 500 oz. The slimes, some 500 tons, are
worth Bdwt., and are untreated. A Ridgway plant is
being installed, and will shortly get to work on them.
Golden Link, Kalgoorlie, is now reported by
manager Haig to have 15,450 tons of ore in reserve above
500 ft. worth 595. 6d. per ton, and 7750 tons of the same
value partly developed. There is also a quantity of
oxidised ore in the mine, on which a profit of £5OO is
anticipated. All this is on the Eclipse lease, so long
regarded pure duffer. # #
Bayley’s Reward, Coolgardie _(W .A.), put
Westralia on its feet, and incidentally did much of the
same sort of thing for Australia, which was at the
moment suffering from bank smash. But Bayley s life
was short; the claim fizzled out, and was practically aban-
doned. After some years it was thought it might pay with
cheaper processes, &c., so it has been tried again ; but it
is once more in Queer-street. The co. has therefore been
granted exemption, on condition that tributes are let.
Some months ago, because one lot of tnbutors landed
on a rich patch, all of them were got rid of, and the co.
tackled the work on its own. As pointed out at the time,
the directors were foolish to do, this, as the tnbutors
were working on half a mile of virgin ground to the north,
and were prospecting what the co. had no funds to
prospect. The co. may, or may not, induce Bull Cohen
to put up more money, but the chances are against it.
* * * *
Great Ophir may some day make things hum
in Davyhurst (W.A.). Down to water level—some 120 ft.
vertical—the lode easily averages 6ft. wide, and is worth
Bdwt. over the plates. An estimate puts the ore reserves
at 40,000 tons, and this is very conservative. If the mine
were in the hands of a strong co. it would be a big
producer. The lode runs east and west, and underlies
north at an angle varying from 35 to 45 degrees. The
same lode has been cut some 1500 ft. east in the Light of
Israel, where it is Bft. wide, and crushings- at the
Government mill have averaged lOdwt. The co. is
installing the old machinery from the defunct Lady Loch,
Coolgardie, and that is a handicap for manager Fey.
m * 9 *
Lancefield, Laverton (W.A.), continues a
puzzle. B.M. and Co. say things are 0.K., but there is
no doubt that the construction of the furnaces was
faulty. It has been stated that arsenical pyrites and
graphite in the sulphide will beat the plaht, as copper
did in the Bellevue ; but this is unlikely.. The lode is
•looking better, and the width and length of the pay shoot
is greater than in any other mine in W.. A. According
to development and boreholes there are 600,000 tons of
ore above 600 ft.; but everything depends Upon whether
a good recovery can be made. #
Gwalia Consols, Wiluna (W.A.), has taken over
the whole assets and plant of the Lake Way Goldfields ;
it is transferring the 20-head mill to the mine, and will
then have a battery of 30 head. There is a big lode on
the property, and the ore is so soft that a 10-head mill
has been crushing 2000 tons monthly. With the 30 head
going it is expected that 6000 tons will be treated
monthly at a profit of 10s. per ton. Above the 100 ft.
level it is estimated that there are 117,000 tons of 30s. per
ton ore in sight. No deep-sinking has been done, as
there was far more ore developed in the niine than the
• 10-head mill could cope with in a reasonable time.
* * * *
Waihi, Davyhurst (W.A.), after a struggle ex-
tending over six years, has closed down, and tributors
may have a cut at it. Mine should never have been
floated into such a co. The reefs and leaders are very
short and erratic, and have no fixed coursfe or underlay,
and it is simply heart-breaking to try to follow them.
No manager is to blame for this fiasco, as no one, how-
ever clever, could do any good with such a property 7.

For low working costs the Anchor tin mine
(Tas.), of which J. B. Lewis is manager, is hard to beat:
122,000 tons were mined and milled for an average of
2s Id. per ton. Omitting decimals, costs divide: wages
Is! 6d., explosives 2£d., stores l£d., renewals 2|d. ; total,
2s. Old. Latterly costs have been a shade below 25., and
stamp duty (upon which costs partly depend) has been
increased to six tons for 24 hours. Recovery of oxide is
slightly under 3£lb. per ton of ore, value about 3s. 6d.
This leaves a profit of Is. 6d. per ton while tin keeps near
£2OO. North Queensland tin-dressing plants get a fairly
high stamp duty (they are finding that crushing ore too
fine is a mistake); but they cannot get within coo-ee of
the Anchor’s.

The Northern Territory Mines of Australia has
shut down its mines, and general manager Dyson goes
south. Mt. Ellison, where it was said no payable copper
would be found, after being abandoned by the co. was
taken up by four Europeans, who, in the first fortnight,
got 50 tons grey ore, going about 45 per cent, copper.
Crowe and Darling, the prospectors who re-
cently found the new goldfield back from Gira, in Papua,
have returned to it; so something more will be known of
it in a few months. Crowe is one of the most experienced
of Papuan prospectors ; he is the last left of the little
band that found the Yodda.

“Dux”: Died at Taranaki (M.L.), Nov. 26th,
George F. Fairs, manager of Taranaki Petroleum Go.,
aged 48. Introduced to M.L. from Australia some six
years ago, he bored 2100 ft. and struck oil, but it petered
out after a few months’ dribble, and the co., against
Fairs’ advice, gave ic up. Fairs then put in what little
money he had, and bored deeper, but without- return.
Funds ran out, so another co. was formed, working
night and day, Fairs struck oil in large quantities at
2»ooft. Other bores were being sunk and plans for re-
fineries discussed when illness beat the strenuous worker.
Just what Taranaki thought of the man can be gauged
by the fact that shares dropped from 15s. 6d. and los.
down to 11s. and 11s. 3d. on his death.

One of the special points to be considered by
the Broken Hill British Mine in the extension of their
present mill, was a suitable roeltbreaker. There are
several types of crushers at the Hill, but the management
of the British decided to purchase Austin Rotary Rock-
breakers after exhaustive enquiry and practical work
with other makes. The Block 10 Co. purchased two
Austin’s some time ago, and these were put to a very
severe test for capacity, horsepower, and wearing ability
—the result has been a triumphant and conclusive proof
that the Austin is the best machine at present offering,
crushing more material with less h.p. than other makes.
They have forced lubrication, double counter shaft
bearings, and are of heavy construction to withstand all
strain. W. and J. Lempriere, of Melbourne, are the sole
agents.'' # # „

KANGAROO : “ Excuse me. I've got a piece of
kangaroo grass in my teeth.”
“ Spring ” : He sat next me on the Bondi
tram. There was a look of lost hope on his face.
He seemed to gloomily realise that never again
would he experience such a dream of unlimited
beer. The tram jerked, and the man ejaculated,
“Would yer, yer cow?” His grip on
the seat tightened and his legs stiffened.
He was settling himself to sit the final buck
which the outlaw gave last spring before settling
down to the obedient life of a station hack. At
last the conductor’s voice, with “Tickets, please! ”
partly aroused him. “ Put me out at Moree,” he>

never returned. John’s remark when a few days

“My word, she come back all li”; and John was
of the same opinion 15 years later. He would
stand outside the hotel where he had met her, on
one particular stone, for hours each day; and also
at the door of the railway station would be seen
his tall pathetic figure.

Christmas, from the point of view of a
man in the inner bush, which is this side of the
outer bush :
The craze of “ camping out” will soon seize the cities
and the towns ; and Codville, like other beauty spots,
will become the tryst of the Vandals. The pea-gun will
wage havoc amongst our insectivorous feathered friends ;
the cocky’s prize rooster will crow in awe, for the
camper-out has gipsy ways when the pot needs refilling.
’Tis now we gather up all the empty nail cans and lay
them temptingly about the river bends, so that the
Vandals may light the billy-brew fire in them instead of
in the open, where the grass is long and the fire-fiend
lurks. The duck-broodsln the swamps will be shattered
ere the close season ends (Jan. 31), and night-luring arts
will be plied, although forbidden. But Codville smiles a
vicious smile at thought of the grass seeds in glorious
abundance this season—the only friends the Outbacker
has to wreak revenge on the "city vandals who spend
little and cadge much in their quest for holiday relaxa-
tion. We expect to find a cow or two, as usual, made
the target of the pea-gun enthusiast; and the late
swallow broods around the river bends laid tribute on the
hook shrine to tempt Old Man Cod. There are plenty of
splendid “camping-out" spots around Melbourne and
the big centres, but the camper on the vandal-ways pre-
fers to get far enough away in his quest for sport (') and
change that when he returns to his bean-patch the
groans of Outback may be unheard. Drat the “camper-
out I ” we say.

“Groper” : I recently came across the
following notice, tacked on the door of a humpy
in the backblocks of Westralia :
NOTIO.
Enny wimmen cornin’ round this way please wate as i
am mattermoneally inklined.
Inquiry led to the discovery that the ancient
hatter wanted a wife, but was so busy hatting
that he couldn’t spare the time to “push his
barrer” to any place where the female sex herds
in large quantities. His nearest neighbor was 10
miles away, and the nearest town 25, so I fear
“ wimmen” passed that way but rarely, and those
that did pass were probably in haste to reach
some place before nightfall, and couldn’t “ wate.”

“H.7.H.” : Re “ Itan ” (B. 22/11/’O6).
Met the ape-like niggers of Centralia in March
last, so can claim to have made the discovery at
least seven months before the professor from the
land of Sauerkraut. The Queenslander held my
M.S. describing them six months in hand before
publishing. The Emperor Billy’s subject comes
along months later, and columns of stuff are pub-
lished re his reputed discovery. Such is luck.

The Bulletin gets this—perhaps in good
faith: —
Sir, —I am an Australian poet, and mean to go it, and
have got together some of the stock-in-trade of the craft.
I have two horses, a bay and a grey—cne of them dead ;
a jockey’s wooden leg; a shingle from a Queensland’
shanty ; the hair-pad of a barmaid ; a billy and weather-
beaten stock-whip ; a Chinaman’s saucepan ; the stave of
an old beer-cask from Cooper’s Creek, besides a bucket
of sacred soil from the Never-Shiver country. But, sir, I
want to get mulga ; can’t get it, or him, anywhere. Is
fit a flowering plant, a long drink, or an individual ?

“Hamer”: “Snakes” is the convenient
■description, but “snakes” is inadequate. Agreat
many people don’t see snakes, even after trying
hard. I know a man who sees wild, white horses,
with open, foaming mouths. A doctor friend
tells me of a woman who sees mice as big as
wolves. It depends largely upon one’s sober
antipathies. George Reid would no doubt see
Sosh, or a fat office with somebody else except
George Reid filling it. Personally I see land-
lords, with writs swaying from their ears.

“N.S.F.” : I saw this. One mare out of
the mob was grazing away from her foal. The
foal was asleep under a tree. I noticed the mare
throw up her head and start away at a gallop
towards the foal. On reaching the foal she shoved
her nose under him, and brought him on to his
feet, and they then trotted away from the tree
together. After going a few yards she turned
round. Almost at the same time a large limb fell
on the spot where the foal had been lying. Was
it remarkable instinct, or was it all just coin-
cidence ? Personally I would have walked under
the limb without suspecting it to be dangerous.

One of the best-regulated and most-scien-
tifically-conducted farms in N.S.W. is managed
by a young woman, aged about 26. She keeps
the books in a methodical style, engages, directs,
and discharges the employees, superintends the
marketing of the products, understands the
accepted system of improving stock, can tell the
inquirer the breed of every animal in the place,
directs the hands at cropping and harvesting, and
generally oversees business. The owner is so
satisfied with his female manager that he has
installed another on a second property, where the
■chief progressive feature is irrigation.
AN ABSENT SORT.
SNOWY : “ Your ole man's a good shickerer, ain't he?"
BILLO : “My oaf I He's that bad that some nights 'e don't get 'ome till next week, an' some
days Vs away a whole month."
The Bulletin doesn’t like talking about
itself, but there is a flavor of Bill Nye liuntor in
this letter: —
Dear Sir, —If the man as writes the “ Answers to
Correspondents” in your paper could only'ave a tithe
o’ the “ bush opinion ” of ’im conveyed to his gentle ear,
there are many who think 'e would never dip pen in the
ebony fluid again. “ Who the ’el is 'e, enyhow,” says
some on ’em, “ that he should claim the boss interlekt,
’n’ try to smother so much of earnest littery effort, which
is inspired in the serene calmness ’n’ peaceful solotude o’
the Australian bush, by innercent waybackers,” who
sware by “the man as writes the leadin’ article” ’n’
“ Plain English,” ’n’ by Hop and Vincent, ’n’ all the
artistick crowd, ’n’ the “ Sundry Showsman,” ’n’ the
“ Wild Cat ” fiend. Yes. They sware by eny o’ these
members o’ yer staff, ’n’ carry The Bulletin in their
swags, ’n’ strap their blankets with it in the July fogs.
Yet, if eny on ’em writes a good yarn ’bout a goanner
swallerin’ a emu, or “The Phantom Lakes o’Wayback,”
or “ The Native Companion’s Quadrille at Sunrise,” ’n’
sits up night after night for more’n a week, punctuatin’
’n’ revisin’, ’n’ then borrows a stamp ’n’ posts it ’n’ waits,
’n’ when the paper comes, to find that the man with
the boss interleckt considers the effort an infliction,
V says he biled the office kettle with it it’s
reely too much for a wayworn scribe, ’n’ you should
just hear ’is voice climb out on the atmosphere in a
10,000 acre paddock. His vocabulary, I’m certain, would
knock the editor o’ the Sydney Hornin’ ’Errald into the
desert wastes of eturnal gloom. ’N' the pore feller will
continue to voiciferate in all the’wayback dialeckts (known
best to those who ’ave endured the hunger, toil, ’n’ strife
o’ the tracksjuntil one of ’ismates readsaloudthe leadin’

nerves o’ that busted littery aspirant. As for meself, I
bear him no anermosity whatever. Altho’, about a
couple o’ decades gone, I did dig some verses out o’ meself
in the dead o’ night, n’ modestly contributed ’em to
The Bulletin. But ’e (the monster) told me I was 49,000

“ Deeby ” : Note how the big land mono-
polist regards everyone travelling along the public
road traversing his property as a vassal of some
sort. Going per sulky from Yass to Queanbeyan,
recently, I was giving my horse his midday feed
when some station women pulled up to ask, with
no end of “ dog,” whether I was a chair-mender.
As I was sporting a new Panama hat and an
excellently-fitting, four-guinea suit, and some-
what pride myself on my appearance otherwise,
I felt resentful. Later, an individual in riding-
breeches hailed me with, “Heah ! I want you to
post this letter when you get into tahown.” There
was no preliminary “ Good day,” so I told him to
give it to the mailman.

“F.H.R.” writes (this controversy is
growing bitter): —
While thanking “ Janor ’’ for his calm, dispassionate
acceptance of my challenge, I would ask him if he really
understands that I mean live snakes. As he wishes the
contest to take place within close range of a pub., per-
haps -it was the beer variety of snake he w. s writing
about all the time. Now I prefer tiger snakes—some-
thing that will cause at least five minutes’ interval after
each bite. The thicker they are the more to hit at.
Meanwhile I am practising at home on six foot of rubber
hose. My nipper has a string attached to the hose, and
every time he jerks it away quick enough to make me
miss, I put 3d. in his money-box. I merely mention this
to let ‘ ‘ Janor ” know I intend to come to the stick in the
best of condition. If he is not too particular re terms,
perhaps he will kill them with his feet. I’d like to see
“Janor’s” feet. Could you manage to decide the
locality at once, so we can bring the match off before
Christmas? I want a new suit.
The Bulletin desires to say that unless these
parties can really get to business, it will be reluc-
tantly compelled to turn off this correspondence
at the meter.

“ W.” : “Valak” writes (B. 22/11/’O6)
upon a subject which he evidently knows little
s u cut. It is true that most snakes will not attack
a human without provocation, and go leisurely
on their way even if a five-ton waggon crosses
their path. The tiger ?:_'ke will, however, almost
invariably attack and chase you if you cannot
disable it. Snakes (except the tiger) are easily
tamed, and take readily to man.

“F.H.R.”: “Paul Cupid’s” egg-eating
dog can be cured, but what’s wrong with muzzling
him ? If he isn’t worth a muzzle a bullet would
cure him instanter. Saw a kangaroo dog cured of
this pernicious habit once. An egg was roasted
and popped into the dog’s mouth, when the jaws
were closed and held until the hot egg was swal-
lowed. After that he leaped several yards
in the air, and swore off hen fruit forever. An
overdose of bolting will stop a horse from running
away. In fact, an overdose of anything will stop
everything. Saw a dog develop the habit of
“tailing” cattle— i.e., catching and pulling the
tails—instead of heeling. One day he got his
teeth fast in a knot in the bull’s tail and w r as
carried round the paddock several times before
being knocked out in the fourth round by the
top of the gate, as Billy took it in his flight. That
cured him of tailing cattle—in fact, it cured him
of living.
THE LIQUOR ACT AGAIN!
MRS. CASEY : “ Pwhat's the matter, Mrs. Dooley!"
MRS. DOOLEY (between sols): “Me Dennis is
nearly dead, an' I can't get his medicine."
MRS. CASEY : “ Why!"
MRS. DOOLEY: “ The pubs are shut!”
“ Maori Mac ” : “ Paul Cupid ” (B.
15/11/’O6) states that eating an overdue egg will
not cure a dog of the habit of devouring the hen’s
ancestor when it comes his way. Perhaps “ Paul ”
is judging the canine tribe in general by one or
two examples. A friend of mine named Bill (the
original) had a half-bred foxhound, famous for
human-like intelligence and strong smelling sense.
It only took about ten minutes to teach Blucher
to hunt for eggs and bring them to the house (Bill
was a fairly prosperous cocky, and the hens had a
casual habit of laying anywhere). One day
Blucher appeared with egg-stains on his counten-
ance and a satisfied look, and Bill swore. Blucher
lived on eggs for about six weeks, and refused to
return to his home and respectability. Then Bill
discovered an old fatherly egg, and he placed the
thing in a dry well, hoping that it would improve
with age. A few days later w r e captured Blucher,
and though he assured us that he had just had an
excellent meal of eggs, we forced the arrears of
hen down the animal’s throat. It cured Blucher.

“ O’Trigger ” (S. Africa) T Whilst agreeing
with much that you say as to the evils of reckless
acclimatisation, there are, as regards the deer
family, some compensating advantages. All the
rifle-ranges in creation are not equal to a few
chances at buck for stimulating enthusiasm in the
use of that beautiful implement, the rifle. In
Britain, of course, this sport is confined to the
very wealthy, but in America and Africa it is not
so, nor need it be in Maoriland. Once the large
game is properly established, there need be no re-
strictions as to its pursuit save the necessary close
seasons. Maoriland has a grand opportunity for
making a nation of riflemen —not target-potters,
but practical field-shots. Australia might follow
in the same line.
SPRING IS LATE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On Dec. Ist it is still wintry along the Big Trickle,
where floods, a cyclone, and other concomitants of wild
weather have been in evidence. The harvest has not
been delayed so late for the last twenty-five years.
The Spring is late at Codville town
For chill the breezes blow—
That they have kissed my Phoebe fair
Her crimson cheek doth show,
And oft my lass so debonair
Now greets me with half-touzled hair !
Though winds the blooms have ravished long
For souls o’ cherries red,
And quaint quail mothers’ fluffy broods
Are cuddled long abed—
A beauty bevy doth aspire
To be Spring’s heralds in our choir !
Here Maisie sports new toque of pink,
And Phoebe one of blue—
Topped daintily the trillers all
Sow gape-seed in each pew,
Ah ! when they sing with souls aflame
The chirping birds are put to shame !
Adown the river freshets flush
The river scents away,
And to the moonlit ripple’s song
The platypussies play—
’Tis early yet to drown the worm,
In legal bonds the anglers squirm !
O’er half-oped censers droning bees
Hold fruitless caucus long,
And round ihe swamps frog bassos greet
Fair Luna with a song—
Too soon, alas, with quivery shake
They’ll serenade the hungry snake !
The Spring is late down Codville way.
The crops are tangled sore—
And where the vandal flood-spume trod
Bush blossoms nod no more I
While stricken gums—as aftermath—
Mark still the raging cyclone’s path I

“ Cross Nibs ” : Be crows, after seeing
two Chinese fossickers, on the ’Quarie, take crows
into custody, the ancient methods of interrupting
them with lead seem wasteful. The pagans’
outfit consisted of a well-worn blanket, staked
down at each corner with a stout forked stick.
Pieces of beef with a solid grain in it, were
fastened securely to the blanket with twine. Ah
Look and How Fat hid in a shallow shaft and
waited for the guests. Presently the bedroom
drapery was covered with crows, each with bulg-
ing eyes and stiffened tail, endeavoring to divorce
breakfast from its moorings. Then the heathen
descended upon the restaurant with fearsome
shrieks, causing the diners to tuck back their
claws, and prepare for an aerial trip. But the
strenuous manner in which they had wrestled
with the bill-of-fare, had caused their claws to pene-
trate the blanket, the result being a postpone-
ment of departure. The pagans got busy with a
knife and a pickle bottle, and in a few minutes
obtained half-a-pint of crows’ gall fluid. They
consider it has medicinal properties, and utilise it
for all ills, including sore feet and appendicitis.
“Falder”: Be “Cocky” (22/11/06)

“ Cocky ” if his sleeper-cutter of the 18 “groved
them out, or ran them out by prayer. A first-

timber is now. Want sleeper-cutters myself;
would like “Cocky” to give me the 18-per-day
man’s address. By the way, what is the Aus-
tralian record for cutting sleepers ?

“ S.C.” : The boss’s kids were in my hut
inspecting my worldly possessions, and I was
meekly submitting to cross-examination. After
telling them for 10 minutes that “ My brother
gave me that,” “Borrowed that off Jim,” “ Best
girl gave it to me,” “ Took a feller down for that,”
etc., etc., the elder dropped a bridle he was over-
hauling and remarked, “Strike me, Bill, have
you got anything hero you paid for ? ”
“Agricola”:
Where will you
find a more
curious combi-
nation of folly
and wisdom
than in t'a e
average mem-
ber of the par-
rot family—the
rosella, ’keet,
&c. ? Twelve
of them will
arrive loudly in
a bunch at the
cherry-tree, or
the peach-tree,
and you can
stand under it
with a pea-rid' l ,
and shoot ten
out of thedozen
before the rest
conclude that a
sudden epide-
mic has broken
out in that gar-
den. Then they
only remove
themselves
three trees
away, and you
can follow them
up and get
them also. Of
course, if you
are not a dead
shot, the first
you wound will
sound enough
alarms to shift

care and you

Now, consider

Parrots, in

ing place, nine

pick the safest
spot available,
and their nests
are the despair
of the small boy. Also, watch Mr. Polly when
he is consuming thistle seeds and you happen
along and disturb him. Without any delay, he
bites off the biggest seed-head within reach, and
flies into the top of the tree next door with it.
Then, with ridiculous ease, he holds it in one foot
while he daintily nibbles away at it, giving you
cheek between mouthfuls, and dropping assorted
refuse on your hat unless you stand from under.
After he has finished that seed-head, he throws it
at you, and departs in a blaze of red and blue for
some more.

“Alba”: The monotony of mining occa-
sionally gets a lift, and things whizz and tremble
in the lower deeps.
Was in Gympie
nine years ago,
when the Govern-
ment was experi-
menting with a
costly drill. The
foreman raised the
drill one morning
for some purpose
or other. Through
carelessness or
over-agitation, he
let go a connecting
rod, and 900-ft. of
unattached drill
flew back with a
muffled roar into
the earth. The
manager's white
face peeped in at
the door suddenly.
“What was that
noise. Bill ? ” he
asked, faintly.
Bill, the foreman,
was on his knees
breathing into the
deep hole where
the drill-head lay
200 ft. below the
surface. When
Gympie heard the
news it closed its
shop and stood
round the shed
while Bill glued
his eye to the hole
and addressed the
earth’s axis in a
voice full of husk
and emotion. The
Minister for Mines
rushed up next
day, and Gympie
put down a coke-
saclc while he knelt
and examined the
deep, narrow hole.
The cost of that
drill could only be
guessed at in those
days, and when the Minister rose and dusted his
knees Gympie turned pale. “No hope of lifting
it?” inquired the Mayor. “Hope!” The
Minister’s face beamed and radiated. “Wait
till the earth turns round on its axis and it’ll fall
out, won’t it ? ” And the frivolous statesman left.
Gympie still waits, and the earth still boggles
round on its axis.

“ Con ” : Be “ Jim’s ” letter about cocky’s
howl (l/11/’O6). It’s about time an Employees’
Accommodation Act was passed. I know a cocky
here in the Western District (Vic.) who employs a
man at shearing and harvest time. Said worker
is up at candle light, and sits down to tea at
9 p.m., and sleeps in the stripper. Fact.
NOT NEGLECTED.

MRS. MAGUIRE (cocky's wife): “Neglected is it!
Why, 'tis meself that's only just given him

“Agricola” on dabsters, boshters, boskers,
and such-like cattle :
Is it allowable to correct “Wang”(B. 22/11/’O6) in his
slang terms ? He remarks that “ boshter ”is a Victorian
weed, while its relative, “ bosker,” lifts up its voice in
sunny Noo South alone. “ Boshter ” is as common as
“bosker”—perhaps even more so—in Sydney, and at
leas five years ago a barber in Paddington proclaimed
himself, in drunken and disorderly capitals which
wandered all over his shop-front, “The Boshter Barber.”
But “ Wang ” ambles completely off the rails when he
explains “dabster” as a variety of “boshter.” In the
davs of my youth I owned a gran’father, whose slang
terms went back to the mesozoic age, and were of the
ame vintage as “ bobby ” and “ copper ” for a modern
“John,” and “ Ohing-go-lingos,” “ yeller-mugs” or
“Johns” for our nowadays “ Chows” or “Pats.’ He
also used language relating to “groats” and “fipenny
pieces” and other archaic curiosities. One morning,
after I had said my ABO backwards, he gave me id.,
and told me that I was a bit of a dabster. From this I
argue that moss was growing on “dabster” early last
century, while the “boshter” family have only dazzled
us for ten short years or so. “ Dabster ”is supposed to
be derived from “daubster” —a painter—and was first
applied by artists to their fellow-craftsmen whose sin
consisted of executing “ pot-boilers.”
Here The Bulletin corrects “ Agricola.”
“Dabster” is the very reverse of “daubster,’
and is derived from “ dab,” and “ dab” is alleged
to grow on the same root as “adept.”
* * •» *
A South Gippslander writes :
Re “Wang” and “bonza”—to use his spelling. I
think he is wrong in giving “ bonzarina ” as the feminine
of that classic word. I have always heard the latter used
as denoting the ne plus ultra of bonzarosity, without dis-
tinction of sex. The tendency at present, however, is
towards condensation rather than elaboration, and the
up-to-date weary slang-whanger briefly remarks : “ Ain t
it a hen?” , , , , . ..
Philological research has also enabled, me to discover
how a pair of pants was transmogrified into “ rammies.’
Rhyming slang transmuted trousers—and transmuted
them very badly—into “round my houses’’—cockney pro-
nunciation, “ rahand me ’ouses.” Certain of the baser
sort, with little regard for the purity of the tank of
British undefiled, corrupted this again to “rammy
’ouses.” The weary individual aforesaid, in one of his
specially tired moments, relinquished the “’ouses ” as too
great a burden, and yawningly asked for his “ rammies.
* • * *
“The Prawn” (N.S.W.) : It is a relief
to be able to quote even one point in which bunny
benefits the pastoralists. In briar-infested plus
rabbit-infested districts his work is well worth
watching. When the grass begins to get dry and
tasteless, bunny tackles bark for a change, and he
prefers the sweet bark of the briar stems to the
ranker covering of the eucalyptus scrub. _ Just at
present the briars in this district are coming into
full leaf ; and I have noticed that scores of the
smaller bushes are ringbarked and quite dead.
Even the large clumps are all dead on the out-
side, and only the inner stems, which are now
protected by a rampart of dead wood, can spring
up. This continual cramping of the growth into
the centre will, in the course of a year or so,
choke them, and cause even the big ones to die
out. Another point I noticed was that in a pad-
dock, containing hundreds of acres of briar-ridden
land, every sucker and seedling had been eaten
down level with the ground. So it is only a
matter of a few years and our lovely imported
rabbits will just about extinguish our lovely im-
ported briars.
“G.H.”: Why do your “ Abo’s. ” jump
in the air when they meet a crawling ophidian ?
All snakes are harmless if let alone, many—“Mun-
dala’s ”, for instance (B. 22/11/’o6)—are harmless
anyhow. A snake is really a very beautiful crea-
ture. The foolish ideal about “sliininess” is
utter rubbish. There is nothing repulsive about
Eve’s friend, except his rotten tooth.
* * • *
“L.P.”: Be “ Yalak’s” par. on snakes
(22/11/’O6). I have an idea that he has been deal-
ing with sand-worms or such like, instead of
snakes. In the Yarram (Vic.) district one year I
remember seeing a 4ft. tiger snake chase a cattle
dog which was going at full speed, and simply
run rings round him, eventually biting him.
The dog died two hours after. When a
snake means business it rears itself up on its
back half, keeps its head well up from the ground,
arches its neck, and springs off its tail, something
like a kangaroo, but a little more wobbly. If
“ Valak ” would like to see a snake travel fast, let
him find a fairly healthy tiger snake which hasn’t
been entered for The Bulletin smell competition—
and treat him like a schoolboy sometimes treats
a Chinaman — viz. , bang a few stones at him, and
if he doesn’t get a good chase pretty quick, well,
that snake is either a goanna or a bit of bent stick.
• * * ♦
“ Nym ” : “ Abo.” scribblers are much con-
cerned because those who handle snakes are
rarely bitten. Simple ! Every “ charmer,”
while keeping his eye on his pet, also keeps his
hand behind the snake’s head on first acquaintance.
A snake must raise its head to strike, or its blow
will be futile. A snake’s head when striking
describes an arc, and the fangs must strike fair
or no poison is emitted. Snakes cannot bite
effectively sideways, and never backwards. In
fact, a snake cannot even see backwards. Also,
when a snake knows its handler means no harm
it doesn’t trouble to bite—for biting is only an
effort of anger or defence. Re snakes chasing
people. They often do so when the humans are
unaware of the fact, particularly at mating time,
and then with no evil intent. Footsteps rustling
the grass lead the Lothario snake to think that
his Mary Jane is eluding his attentions in favor
of Bill Jim from across the swamp. Then the
villain pursues her. If snakes (except the tigers)
were better understood, I think no man’s hand
would be against them ; for as mousers, centipede
demolishes, etc., they are treasures.
* * * *
“ F.H.R.” : Can understand the blacks’
partiality for snakes as a food, for they are about
the cleanest bush inhabitant we have. They seem
to eat nothing offensive. Compared with a fowl
or duck, they stand as high as the Australia Hotel
above the fourpenny restaurant.
“8.H.D.” : “Janor” (B. 29/11/’O6) asks
where snakes are thickest. I nominate portions
of the mallee country surrounding Sea Lake
(Vic.). There’s 3 bags to the acre there. There s
one of the species which measures, when a man is
sober, 15ft. long and Ift. through.
* * * *
‘ ‘ Agricola ” : Be “ The Proosh*n (B.
15/11/’O6) and the running-water cure for snake-
bite. The same cure is used by miners, when
stung by venomous creepies—spiders, centipedes,
scorpions, etc. —and they claim that it gives
speedy relief, and that there are ho evil after-
effects from the wound. The theory of this cure
is that because running water is always consider-
ably below blood-heat, the blood-vessels contract
with the cold. In the case of snakebite, this con-
traction prevents the venom from passing towards
the heart, and thus affecting the whole of the
circulatory system. In . regard to ‘‘creepy
bites, where the affection is mostly local, the fact
that the blood supply is shut off prevents inflam-
mation and consequent pain. In both cases it is
most likely that the greater part of the venom
will be forced out through the wound by which it
entered. This is the theory, as explained to me
by a medical man, who had observed black
brother Billy using the running-water cure in
his native haunts. Another remedy much in
vogue among diggers, in case of bites by
scorpions, &c., is to spread a liberal coating of
mustard over the place.

“ S.R.” : The biggest cheque I have
known to be made at marsupial shooting was an
average of £6O a week for six men for five
months. That was in the eighties, in Central
Queensland, and was for scalps only. Kangaroos
yd., wallabies 6d., ’roo rats 3d., dingoes 21s. per
tail. No skinning was done. A fortune was
wasted in the hides.

Paddy Cahill writes, with indignation, re
buffalo shooting in the Northern Territory :
When “Banjo” Paterson, Martin and Reese were
shooting on the Adelaide River, their total was about
1100 head. I was shooting on the East Alligator, and
my tally for a month was 1605 head. I have shot more
buffalo in one season than Ben Martin has shot in two ;
vet I consider Joe Cooper the boss shooter. As regards
big bags. William Johnstone and myself shot 63 beasts
in one day ; I got 43 head with 62 cartridges, Johnstone
16, and a black boy four. My biggest day was 48 head.
Ben Martin, in my opinion, is a long way from being in
the front rank as a buffalo-shooter ; for myself I put in no
claim at all as a champion, but honor where honor is due.
Joe Cooper has been shooting for over 20 years, and is
still at it, and doing good work. Re Ben Martin offering
to back himself against me for £5O. The only talk of a
wager between Martin and myself was this : I told Mar-
tin that I had £5O or £5OO to wager that he could not hit
the ground with a Martini-Henri bullet every 25 yards.
That is, Martin had to keep alongside a man on horseback
and go at about the pace that a buffalo generally travels,
load, and shoot every 25 yards.

“ Nym ” : The wisdom of extending the
close season for fish and prohibiting netting is
now apparent along Victoria’s inland waterways.
Golden perch, silver bream, and Murray perch—
the kinds that used to go mostly the netters way,
while following the early freshets, spawning—
were never so plentiful as this season. Ihe exten-
sion of the wild-fowl slaughter-day till the end of
January is a wise move, too, in view of the
clutches of eggs that line the swamp haunts.
DOG-TIRED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Iron Knob (S.A.) is now the one dogless township of
Australia.—Bullbtin (22/11/’O6).
Though my arm is badly broken (dogs collided with my
bike);
Though I’ve many a doggy token—sears and bruises and
the. like,
Prom dog-started buggy crashes—and my nerves are all
3LgOg
With the large and varied smashes which were also
caused by Dog :
Though in memory I’m keeping all the time a bulldog s
bite;
Though I’m scarcely ever sleeping (dogs are howling day
and night);
Still of health I have a prospect in that township nor’-
nor’-west,
Where the mongrels cease from yelping and the yappers
are at rest;
Yes, I’ll pretty soon be plodding on the convalescent
road
If you’ll wrap me up in wadding and in Bafety see me
stowed,
And consign me, O my brothers, by the rail or dray 01
Cobb,
To that blessfed dogless Mecca that is known as Iron
Knob!

Mr. W. Tyree,
Sydney.
Dear Sir,
My father tells me to write you about your Patent
Spray. Since he arrived home we have had a gay old
time. The old man has been working the spray for all
it is worth ; first, he sprayed the orchard, then he white-
washed the fowl-houses ; then he sprayed the fowls and
the dogs. Next day he got up at daylight and painted
the fences and the cow-sheds (we had great trouble to
keep him from painting the cows). As soon as he felt he
was an artist at the game, he painted the house outside ;
the iron roof he has finished off dead white with re-
frigerating paint, and the walls a beautiful stone color;
it looks all right. Then he sprayed all the flowers in the
garden. The kids lit a fire near the haystack, he rushed
off like a fire brigade and put the fire out with the spray.
He has washed the carts and disinfected all the place,
and now he has got mother on the job kalsomining the
rooms.
Yesterday he sent the boys out with it to poison the
rabbits and kill the white ants ; they came back quite
delighted with the day’s work ; but, as they looked a bit
dirty the old man had it filled up with soap and water
and washed them down in the back yard. My word, you
ought to see him firing the “ dead beats ” off the
premises, he keeps the spray fully charged with
insecticide and the moment they come in the gate he gets
to work at them—they never come back; he simply
squirts them off the estate.
Father wants to know if you can improve it so that he
can milk the cows and chop the wood with it. He says if
you can do this he can sell hundreds of them to the
neighbors.
No more at present,
Yours faithfully,
BILL WILLIAMS.*
The paternal grandfather of champion
drover Rose was at the founding of Sydney,
1788, being on the staff of Governor Phillip ; and
John Batman, the founder of Melbourne, is
Rose’s grand-uncle, on the maternal side.
S. Australian Chief Justice Way has a
dread of having his decisions reversed by the
High Court or the Privy Council. So he runs a
“slow and sure” course, taking a long, long time
to decide the smallest point raised, and consulting
everybody whose judgment is worth twopence.
He sat cogitating over one verdict for over a year,
and is said to have consulted about it every legal
luminary available, including the court crier.
Hubert de Castella (with his wife and five
children) is returning to Victoria after an absence
of many years, and intends to end his days here.
Hubert, who is now 82 years of age, with his
brother Paul, were the first to successfully estab-
lish vineyards in Victoria. The Hubert vine-
yard (Lilydale) became famous in 1881, when its
product won, at the International Exhibition at
Melbourne, the prize (a gold and silver trophy,
valued at £1000) offered by the German Emperor.
A design has been chosen for the statue
of the late Melbourne Bard-of-Works Fitz-
gibbon. The Argus describes the design with
enthusiasm : “It is heroic in proportion and
flamboyant in attitude.” That sounds very like
old Fitz., who was always “ flamboyant in
attitude,” but the statue is a wasteful and
ridiculous excess while Melbourne ratepayers have
the huge monument of debt, resulting from the old
man’s management of the Metrop. Board, whereby
to remember him.
N.S.W. Public Service is indulging in a
mild wonder as to who will get the jobs on the
Public Service Board to be vacant at the end of
this year. Dick, M.L.A., is regarded as a
certainty for Wilson’s place, and it is supposed
that a man in the service will get Barling’s. C. J.
Saunders, although one of the junior under-
secretaries in point of service, is a strong tip.
Being at the Treasury, and consequently wood-
and-water-Joey to Carruthers and Dick as well,
he has a supposed mortgage on an offer.
“Maori Mac” : I object. The two-headed
baby, the two Isitts, and Tommy Taylor are
Maorilanders—but not Judkins. He is a native
of Daylesford (Vic.), and Daylesford seems to be
very busy forgetting it. If Daylesford had pro-
duced a five-legged calf it would have bellowed
the news, but it keeps a guilty silence in the face
of this other calamity. Jud. did, however, squeeze
a living out of Maorilanders for a few years, first
as a preacher, and afterwards as an auctioneer.
Manager Cooper, of the Adelaide Adver-
tiser, has in his possession a slab of diary kept by
Colonel Light, the founder of Adelaide. It
records in faded ink the Colonel’s marchings,
fightings and campings during the Peninsular
War, and runs from April 1809 to the end of 1812.
Presumably there are other volumes covering the
rest of Light’s career, for when a man once gets
the diary habit it sticks, but the whereabouts of
the rest of the work are unknown.
“ Itan ” ; Peace to the ashes of “ Bobby ”
Byrne! He reached Bananaland as medical officer
of an immigrant ship in the sixties. It was
he who pointed out the site of Townsville to
Captain Towns as a likely place to land
during a cruising trip north, and when they
succeeded in getting ashore he christened
the new settlement. After exploring in the
Gulf, he opened the first store at Burke-
town. He was a member of that Lands-
borough exploration party which started
west, but, after several days’ march, found
itself back very near its starting poin t. After-
wards Byrne drifted into journalism, with
more or less success. He was a great bar-
racker for Mcllivraith, but let loose all his
Billingsgate on Griffith when Samuel took
office, and his Government advertisements
quickly slumped. Once he cartooned Premier
Morehead in a bitter fashion. Bobby’s over-
draft at the Q.N. Bank at the time was £250,
and Morehead was a director. The over-
draft was forthwith called up. He missed
making a good haul at the beginning of the
Mount Morgan insanity. Pattison, M.L.C.,
offered to take Bobby’s p.n. and find the
cash wherewith to buy 2000 shares, which
were then standing at £2. Bobby would
only plunge as far as 100 shares, though
even out of them he made £BOO.
Died at Manilla (N.S.W.), aged 76,
Chorles Baldwin, owner for 55 years of
Durham Court stud. The Durham Court
sires included Yelverton, The Drummer,
Somnus, Marvellous and Nobleman, and from
the Durham Court strain were produced
The Assyrian, Highborn, Paris, Bungebah, and
other well-remembered performers.
General Hoad, Inspector-General of the
Commonwealth forces, started military life as a
cadet (his first drills were in Sydney), was after-
wards a full private in the citizen forces, and has
now climbed up to the top of the military tree.
The Brewers’ Journal, December, says
that the largest salary ever paid in the world to a
brewer was taken by R. K. Montgomerie, at
M'Cracken’s, in Melbourne. Paid by results,
he wrought up to £BOOO a year. The Australian
Mortgage and Finance Co., in London, paid to
manager E. M. Young £7500 a year as the fruit
of his Australian experience with banking in con-
nection with squattages.
A Mr. Henry Bischoffsheim, a London
banker, has got rid of £lOO,OOO (including the
gift of £40,000 to the Cancer Research Associa-
tion) in commemoration of his golden wedding.
This is presumably the husband of the Mrs.
Bischoffsheim whose portrait by Millais, exhibited
at the Royal Academy some 30 years ago, was a
masterpiece of honest flattery. The painter
depicted the matron’s face as a work of art,
very handsome in its obvious “ make-up.”

“I have used Chamberlain’s Colic,
Cholera, and Diarrhoea Remedy, and speak from
experience,” says Mr. F. Schmaka, Paddington,
W.A., “ I have never known it to fail in an attack
of colic, cramps, or diarrhoea, so always recom-
mend it to my friends and customers. To my
mind, no mother should be without a bottle of
Chamberlain’s Colic, Cholera, and Diarrhoea
Remedy in the house. Many people are preju-
diced against patent medicines, but if they only
knew the splendid qualities of this one, it would
go a long way to wear down that prejudice.”
It is during the warm months of summer
that mothers have to be most careful of their
little ones, and at the first unusual looseness of
their bowels should give the little sufferer a dose
of Chamberlain’s Colic, Cholera, aud Diarrhoea
Remedy. Get it to-day; it will save trouble
later on.*
AN EYE TO THE FUTURE.
“ Aye, and at the last , will ye see that there's a pair of blue spectacles put into the coffin
with me?”
“Why, brother? ”
“ Well, y' see, yeller always gimme a bilious turn, and Tm almost feared the sight o' them
golden streets may strike just a wee bit strong."
Sam Gillott, whose principal characteristic
has been hard-headed, unemotional business acu-
men, has dropped out of office and political life
at the first blast of hostile criticism. Gillott has
been used to having it all his own way. When he
was head of Gillott, Oroker, Snowden and Co. he
managed to dominate the cantankerous Snowden
and assertive “Brummel” Croker. Gillott was
David Syme’s attorney, and the Speight v. Syme
case contributed to the dissolution of the firm. As
a matter of fact, it became too unwieldy. Snow-
den took away with him a junior partner, Neave,
and then founded the firm of Snowden, Neave,
and Demaine, in Chancery Lane. Gillott made
up a good trio with Bates and Moir, in Collins
St. Snowden got the municipal knighthood
first, and Sam was “ Sir’d ” some years later. W.
H. Croker, who stuck to the bluestone building,
and did well on his own, was supposed to be after
the City Solicitorship when Stephens died ; but
he didn’t get it.
A word from Maoriland :
Alter the Caesar-like methods of the late Seddon, the
gentle sway of Ward was like the gentle dew that comes
down on the cabbage plants by night. With all his
democrac)’, Seddon was a thorough autocrat, who bullied
the House and his Cabinet unmercifully. Members who
wanted information were told brusquely to wait till the
statistics were published ; whereas Ward would give any
member any figures he wanted. He would rather go and
count the substance personally than not oblige. Seddon
thought nothing of holding back the most important
returns while a subject was under debate, so that members
of the Opposition should be hampered by ignorance of
the matter. But his saving grace was that the old man
was a Democrat all the time in his aims and objects, and
he usually managed to make his end justify his means.
He was brought up, as far as Parliament was concerned,
in a most corrupt school—the school of the old Continu-
ous Ministry, and evolution used him as a means to give
the Tories a taste of their own medicine. He made
Parliament a machine for carrying out what he believed
to be the wishes of the majority of the people, for his
policy was always a glorified opportunism. When he
saw the public mind pointing emphatically in any direc-
tion, he rushed in and drove Parliament helter-skelter
that way. Ward has made the House a polite board
meeting, or a friendly debating society, or something
equally pleasant, and walks soft-footedly like Agag
stepping lightly upon eggs.
The death was lately announced of Edward
J. Reed, Chief Constructor of the British Navy
from 18G3 to 1870, aged 76. He opposed the
building of the turret ship Captain, designed by
Captain Coles, and ordered by vote of Parliament
to be built. When it was built. Constructor
Reed considered his career at the Admiralty
closed ; but the top-heavy Captain turned turtle
in the Bay of Biscay, drowning its designer and
many others, and the star of Reed was again in
the ascendant. Reed entered Parliament in 1874
as a Radical, and remained a member until the
recent dissolution.
Geoffrey Eagar, father of the Eagar whose
death was recently reported, stood up for N.S.W.
civil servants one time in a style that frightened
Parliamentary traducers. Eagar was Under-
secretary in the Treasury, and the Government
was under stricture over a meat contract.
M'Elhone, the Boanerges of the day, did not limit
his censure to the Government, but declared that
the upper officers in the Treasury “ had had palm
oil.” Eagar challenged M’Elhone to come off the
floor of the House and stand up to him in the
Supreme Court. M'Elhone showed the white
feather. For some time after civil servants
received better treatment.
Rev. Charles Matthews writes :
You are much too kind to myself, and you are also mis-
taken as to Australian parsons being relegated to the
bush while Englishmen remain in the towns. As a
matter of fact, nearly all the young bush parsons
are imports like myself. Our trouble is that the best
type of young Australian, so far, won’t become a
parson. As a rule, he is put off by meeting the wrong
sort of parson, either in real life, or in books of the “ On
Our Selection ” type—or in The Bulletin. On the other
hand, too often the wrong type of Australian—the goody-
goody j'oung man—comes forward, and gets a good train-
ing, which tends to make him a goody-goodier young man.
I am hoping that before long we shall have some society,
like the extremely democratic “ Community of the
Resurrection ” in England, which will get hold of the best
type of young Australian and make of him the best type
of parson. And I should like to say a word in defence of
Mr. Hopkins, the returned missionary from Melanesia—
the smallest man physically at the Congress, and as a
man worth many of the other speakers lumped together.
Mr. Hopkins did not “bleat” about his troubles, as The
Bulletin would lead one to believe, nor did he suggest
retaining the kanakas permanently in Australia. All he
asked was that they should not be dumped down in ship-
loads, armed, and with no provision made for safeguard-
ing the unarmed people of his island. Surely a reason-
able request? Personally I started three cheers for the
missionary at the Congress—and I believe if The Bulletin
had heard him, and knew the kind of man he is, it would
have joined in.
Tired in the morning ? There are times
when the night’s rest doesn’t fit you for the day’s
work. Those are the times for a stimulant that
will brace you up and stay by you. The best of
all tonics is Wolfe’s Schnapps.*
“ They say that General Hoad is a Vic-
torian ; but he was born in Goulburn, N.S.W.,
and is, therefore, a N.S. Welshman.” Thus
Colonel Waddell to a gathering of N.S.W.
officers to greet the new Inspector-General. And
most of those present cheered wildly. But why
so stress the absolutely immaterial ? Are we not
all Australians now ?
Died last month, in Maoriland, Thos.
Dwan, one of the sturdy Australian pioneers who
helped the Commonwealth to its early strenuous-
ness. Bom in Ireland, he saw hard life in Canada
and U.S.A. (where he was an army officer). The
gold discoveries attracted him to Australia and
later to Maoriland. In his old years he was
auctioneer and journalist.
The warmest of welcomes should await
artist Streeton, who returns to Australia this
month. Streeton, more than any other artist,
comprehended Australian sunlight, and put it
lovingly on to canvas. In the dull atmosphere of
Britain he was lost, and he has chosen well to
come back to the native land which now knows
how to appreciate his work.

John Logan Campbell, the ninety-year-old
medical man, brewer, and “Father of Auckland”
(M.L.), celebrated his birth anniversary the other
day. The old man was made Mayor of Auckland
for the York festivities, and a knightly bauble
arrived for him as soon as the Dukelet returned
to office-work. In return for the bauble, and out
of his love for the people who had drunk
Campbell’s beer for so many years, th« old man
gave the people “Cornwall Park,” worth about
£lOO,OOO. It was old John who squashed the pro-
posal of the Auckland City Council to paint the
top of Mount Eden white, in order to persuade
the Yorklets that it was a snow-clad affair. He
declined flatly to take in a harmless little Duke.
He married a young wife a few years ago, but she
died soon after.
A DAN YELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An Australian lady, returned from abroad, informs me
that Dan. O’Connor has reaped his beard.
I wish I’d never gone to board
In that house where I met
The touring lady from abroad,
Who mocks my night rest, yet.
I wish—l wish that she had saved
Her news of what she’d seen—
That Dan. O’Connor is clean shaved,
And parts his hair between.
• The ladies down at Manly now—
And widows understood —
No more deplore their marriage vow,
Or hopeless widowhood.
For Dan. O’Connor is the same
As though he’d never been,
Since Daniel shaved that shave of shame,
And combed his hair between.
The lobby and refreshment-room
Are shorn of half their larks,
A newer ghost now haunts the gloom
That knew the ghost of Parkes.
The brightest joke Australia had,
Is but a hopeless grunt—
It went forever mad and bad
When Daniel shaved his front.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, December 18, 1906.
My Dear Ar tni.—
If women—single women, of course—get into
Parliament, will they bring in a Bill to legalise
the Burning of Widows ? It would be a popular
piece of legislation. I have several dear friends
who are widows, and two or three of them are
young. A little widow is a dangerous thing ; more
so than a little learning. It would cause me intense
grief to lose these friends by fire, but the call of duty
(even if it demanded of me the match wherewith
jo light the funereal pyre) would be obeyed. If
suoh a measure does become law new omens will
gather around the wedding day. Imagine your
fair and hated rival coming out of church lean-
ing on the arm of her latest and most loved
acquisition, and just then, manoeuvred by your
jealousy, a load of wood halting, as if by accident,
close to the bridal carriage. If you are super-
spiteful the wood might smell of kerosene.
Imagine the shudder that would shake the bride
and the paling of her cheek at the horrid omen.
Or you might send a few loads of firewood and a
silver match-box as a wedding present.
These few remarks are suggested by the re-
cent rise on the matrimonial market of the
widow —the quite mellow widow especially. She
is always in steady demand, but often she spurts,
and just now she is as fashionable as copper. In
England some years ago there was phenomenal
and sustained demand for the dear and Weeded
Bereft. But somehow it dropped with the mar-
riage of Lady Randolph Churchill to young
West.
That enterprising and well-dowered widow,
Mrs. Flood, has taken notice (in London) after
being fifteen years a relict. She has taken a
Major Winehcombe, whom she met here during
the Jubilee festivities. Although she is a grand-
ma, Mrs. Flood is a well-preserved rudely one,
and a simple sailor hat of sunburnt straw with a
wreath of burnt roses didn’t make her look a bit
ridiculous. Mrs. Winehcombe, as she is now, is
a sister of Francis Suttor, of the Lovely Legß.
Miss Grace Palotta’s little novel, in eleven
chapters, “A Viennese Romance,” has done its
maiden canter through a Melb. weekly. Table
Talk. Tale has a sub-title —“The Life and
Adventures of an Actress ” —and though it runs
on quite conventional lines, the telling is done
with simplicity and directness. It reads like a
play written up into a novelette. All the situa-
tions are dramatic, and one can imagine Miss
Palotta playing the heroine, Wanda, the
young strolling actress, who, after tempta-
tions and persecutions by a bad man and
a jealous woman, finally comes into her
rights as the daughter of an Austrian prince and
the possible bride of a lover of high degree. The
latter had honorably wooed her when she was
merely Wanda, and earning her own living. If
she has not raised any new corn, Miss Palotta
scatters good-quality old seed, and does it with a
strong hand —in spots. In one chapter where the
proud noble declares himself, ttye love-making
shows a spark of real passion, and the reflections
of the heroine as she talks down'her heart, forcing
upon it to breaking point the Renunciatory creed
‘ Thou shalt do without” lift the story markedly
from its general level. The bright and effervescent
Viennese atmosphere is not wanting, and there is
a good vignette study of Madame Wolter, the
Bernhardt of Vienna'. Story is illustrated by
Ruby Lindsay.
Remarked last letter that Miss Ola Humphrey
was responsible for a .matrimonial engagement—
that of Mr. Keegan, an American merchant, to
Miss Eileen King. Seems that the engagement
of actor Charles Waldron to Miss May King came
about through Ola Jane introducing the pair;
and Ola Jane gets a handsome diamond ring as a
souvenir of the incident. Miss May King is
one of the handsomest of Sydney girls. By the
way, report says Miss Ola Jane herself got en-
gaged a day or two before the turbine took her to
M.L. If the report prove true, a number of
Sydney men are going to solace themselves with
a prussic acid cocktail.
Mr. Cuyler Hastings is said to be on his way
back to Sydney.
Miss Elyda Russell, who lately scored a vocal
success in London, is a daughter of the late Mr.
Geo. Russell, and sister of Mr. Alison Russell, of
the Clyde engineering works. Her millionaire
uncle, P. N. Russell, died recently. The new
singer had been studying in Germany the piano
and violin, but shelved those instruments for
vocal studies.
Flight of the outward-bound for overseas starts
after Xmas. The Degens have postponed their
departure for a month, and the distinguished-look-
ing fiddler may give some concerts in Melbourne
in the meantime. The Markells are shooing the
moths out of their long-journey grips. Mrs.
Walter Elkington (aunt of Melba’s prospective
daughter-in-law) and her little son are doing the
same. The motor car Prestons are going to M.L.
Miss Maud Dalrymple writes from Wales: —
I am writing to ask you to kindly contradict the
report (B. 27/9/’O6), which evidently emanates from
someone antagonistic to me. The statement that I have
lost my voice is entirely with, ut foundation, as the
number of my singing engagements, past and future,
will show. For November alone I have more than a
dozen engagements. lam singing four Sundays with
the National Sunday League—the first of those taking
place last Sunday at Queen’s Hall—the other artists in-
cluding Madame Ella liussell, whom you all know. Last
Saturday (Nov. 3rd) I took the contralto part in “The
Golden Legend,” the tenor being Mr. Harold Wilde, who
toured Australia with the Watkin Mills Co. On Satur-
day.next (Nov. 10th) I am singing at the Alexandra
Palafee. In addition to these engagements I have several
Scotch concerts booked.
When a seaman—especially of albatross status—
comes away from his all-round water-frontage for
good, he goes on the land away from the great
pickling vat of the ocean. There’s been a hand-
some piece of the silyerside—he doesn’t look the
ordinary corned at the Australia
lately, Captain Carter, who commanded the
battleship Glory on the China station. He has
taken to the trade of the first man, and, instead of
looking through a port-hole at brave sea-horses
that gather and gallop, he blinks at meek sheep
from the coign of a deep station-house verandah
in the Armidale district. (Come to think of it,
I don’t fancy sheep do loiter so close around the
homestead as to be seen from the verandah.)
A gay old bachelor Reginald in Sydney gets
no end of feminine adoration through his habit of
calling every woman of his acquaintance “ Baby.”
From the maiden of fifteen up to the widow of
fifty and much over, the She to whom he is
speaking or writing is “Baby.” And they all
like it, for much the same reasons—long hair and
short skirt, because to her it is a word of endear-
ment ; and to the old and older women it brings
the thought that they must look irresponsible
young things—since he, at any rate, feels pater-
nally towards ’em.
Mrs. Lala Fisher, now hostess at Medlow Bath
Hydro, is a Queenslander who has published
volumes of verse and short stories, and is an all-
round bright writer and prattler, singer and player.
Knox Darcy, the Mount Morganaire, is her
uncle. Shewasfor a time on the British Austral-
asian during Mennell’s editorship, and can talk
of Australians in London until the shadows gather
in the west. For a while Mrs. Fisher “ read ” for
Fisher Unwin, and one of her recollections in that
line is that she strongly recommended for his
acceptance a book by an Australian lady. The
publisher asked what price he might offer for the
tale, and the “reader” ventured to say fifty
pounds. Some time afterwards Mr. Unwin told
Mrs. Fisher that the writer had accepted one
pound for her book. Most of us know that a cer-
tain London publisher (well-known and thriving)
gives not more than ten pounds for a book. It is
only fair to surmise that he often loses on the
transaction—but one pound sounds like a mone-
tary snub.
Mr. Charles Wentworth Dilke, son of Baronet
Dilke, is in Sydney and staying at the Australia.
A fair and Saxon-looking man of 30 or so, whose
profile doesn’t dovetail with his full face. This
is his second visit to Australia, and he doesn’t
say “Haw!” too aggressively. Mr. Dilke was
at “ La Tosca” last week with the Monty Severns,
and opinioned that Miss Tittell Brune showed
strength and genius in the appalling role.
“ Teddy Roosevelt ” bears are climbing all over
Sydney—inside shop-windows. They are among
the latest presents for the small boy and girl.
Which reminds that, in that clever little exhi-
bition of Australian Art, Mass Irene Mort
showed a lot of Australian animal toys, carved
by herself ; also an Australian animals alphabet.
Know a girl who has such a horror of the corners
of her mouth turning down that she carries one of
Norman Lindsay’s native bears (cut from an
illustration) pasted inside her watch. When she
feels gloomy she looks at her bear and gives way
to glee until her mouth becomes an upward
crescent.
Tittell Brune’s husband arrived by the American
liner last week, and brought his automobile with
him. It is said to be a real elegant machine.
By the way, someone has perpetrated the epi-
gram that “ every motorist is at heart a fisher-
man. ”
Eldest son of Archdeacon Gunther, of Parra-
matta, was married last week to Mrs. Inglis,
widow of the late Dr. Inglis, of Newcastle.
Something unusual in the way of best-manning.
Dr. Scot Skirving was best man at the wedding
of his step-father-in-law, Mr. Waller, to Mrs.
Andrew Seton Chisholm.
Signora Dane Valenti, with her voice like cut
steel—as hard and bright—and peeress-like
appearance, gives the impression of being suited
to certain operatic rdles as if they had been made
to her order and vocal measurements. But her
mezzo soprano has been trained to the
edge (and nearly slipping over) of perfec-
tion. There’s nothing like marrying the expert
trainer if you desire notes and tones filed and
polished and cut and tinted. Her qpe concert in
the Criterion Theatre brought a small but appre-
ciative audience, of which a quarter was Press,
in its best clothes.
Mr. Llewelyn Davies (senior partner of that
spacious firm, Davies and Fehon) has become
engaged to Miss May Sparke—a stylish Darling
Pointer, and one of the late millionaire Sparke’s
heiresses. She is still in the teens years, and
the pair met on the same steamer returning from
abroad. Bridegroom-elect has a perfect orchid
of a house on the/'foater’s edge at Point Piper,
and some motor launches that might race a comet.
Miss Maisie Kelly (a sister of Mr. W. H. Kelly)
and Miss Innes (a daughter of late Justice Innes)
have started a girl bachelor-establishment at
Darling Point.
Mark Hambourg, on his own showing, won his
fair and moneyed bride in a Chopin achievement
—the Sonata in B flat minor, of all pieces ! The
gem of its setting—the Funeral March—rather
dims the lustre of the rest of the jewel. Shy
boy, Mark ! Personally, I didn’t think any pretty
girl would say “Yes” to him except under an
anaesthetic, fie is very like a pre-Adamite man.
But he can evidently play Chopin to Miss
Mackenzie’s taste. Chopin is the favorite com-
poser of women, and a critic has written that “ to
girls of 18 or thereabouts Chopin is a sentimental
religion. Sympathetic medical men have diag-
nosed the symptoms,, and declared them Chopi-
nitis.”
Within the gay-flowered and walled garden of
Parliament House, on Saturday, certain Parlia-
mentarians and Pressmen played the first match
of what will be an annual bowling meeting. Mus-
lin ed and garden-hatted women came by the score
and exulted with the victorious legislators or
sympathised with the defeated pressmen. Also,
they had melting moments with the teams’ ice-
creams and tea. Mesdames R. Arthur, Wade,
Hogue, Paterson, E. W. O’Sullivan, and
S. W. Moore (with the last a daughter
with a face like Mendelssohn’s Spring Song
materialized) occupied the balcony of the mighty.
Mr. Watkin Wynne, of the D.T., who captained
the Quill team, has lately returned from Europe
with the comforting knowledge that his two sons’
sight will be saved. A large German specialist
has arrested the progress of the trouble—a con-
traction of the retina.
Of the three famous contraltos, Butt, Crossley,
and Muriel Forster, the last is the least-boomed.
Yet Hugo Gorlitz puts her first of the trio. He
says she’s not only the finest, but that the English
acknowledge her as such. She is unusually beauti-
ful, and noted for her reserve and religious lean-
ings. All the contralto music Elgar has written
of late was composed for her. However, this rare
bird is now out of the competition; her health
has given way. Concerning violinists, Herr
Gorlitz gives a higher place to Marie Hall than
to Kubelik or Mischa Elman.
Mr. “Essie Jenyns” Wood has advertised
“Jesmond,” Newcastle, for sale by auction, and
the family leaves soon for Europe.
Wedded, on Dee. 3, at St. Paul’s, Byron Bay,
William. .Unthank Norton to May Neredah,
grand-daughter of that Frederick Ebsworth who,
in the early ’4o’s, was in Bligh-street, Sydney, as
a woolbroker, and had a private house at Milson’s
Point. This Mr. Ebsworth is said to have, in
1838, boiled down sheep for tallow, and found it
pay well. That was before they had learned how
to freeze the innocent surplus beast or put him in
a tin and call him ham and chicken.
“With men lying is a diversion, with women
a habit,” a cynic philosopher has said, and really
the gibe is borne out by the performances of some
of the ladies who took it on themselves to
“help” the Anti-Socialist cause at last elections.
(I really must say something of the elections.
Sydney talks nothing else just now.) No fiction
was too feeble, no effrontery too great for many
of them. There were, naturally, exceptions. On
all sides some women did fair and honest canvass-
ing work, and I suppose had the right to do it,
though, personally, I think that the less can-
vassing women do at elections the better, in
spite of the august example of that lovely Duchess
of Devonshire who, on behalf of Charles Fox,
charmed the Westminster electors, so that
The butchers and the bakers
The grocers, undertakers,
The milliners and toymen
All vote for Carlo Ivhan.
And one butcher had his vote bought with a
kiss, and another honest voter (an Irishman, of
course) exclaimed of the fair canvasser, “Sure, I
could loight me poipe at her eyes.”
The Anti-Socialist ladies who went into can-
vassing for “ the fun of the thing,” as an alterna-
tive to Bridge or shopping, and really didn’t know
or didn’t care much about the issues involved,
were not at all particular about what they said,
and mostly seemed to have helped the side they
went out to curse. In the Newcastle electorate,
for instance, a Sydney social light descended in
great glory of dress, and to an audience of “ lady
electors ” descanted on the purity of the home and
the tyranny of trades-unionism. Most of those
lady electors had a trades-unionist husband at
home, and went away boiling, and the seat was
thereafter safe for the Labor man, who before was
in serious danger owing to the apathy of his sup-
porters.
Surely all the Bar were at the dinner to Mr.
Justice Isaacs and Mr. Justice Higgins last
Wednesday at the Wentworth Hotel. There were
72 barristers. Think of the legal knowledge at
work there—on the pigeon caserole, the saddle of
lamb, the strawberry ice cream, peach souffle,
angels-on-horseback and the rest. There were 12
courses. Emily Soldene would have had a con-
suming love for it. Two toasts —The King and
Our Guests. Novel decorations: baskets in the
shape of garden seats filled with moss, flowers and
fairy lights.
Dr. Mary Booth, who big mother-and-
baby practice in Sydney, has just left for a year’s
holiday travel.
A bunch of real photographic post-cards of stage
beauties, who are at present playing in Australia,
is forwarded to me by Collins Bros, and Co., of
Clarence-street.
Another engagement, that of Miss Cassie Hay-
ward, daughter of the captain of the Ventura.
She has been staying in Sydney, and left yester-
day. Her intended used to walk five miles when
’Frisco was ’quaked to get the girl of his heart a
loaf of the kind of bread she liked.
If Mr. William Anderson’s elephant Alice
shoots the chute down at Wonderland, her owner
will probably advertise for a tailor and shoemaker
to make clothes and boots for her —splinter-proof
leather pants and elephants’ boots the size of a
tea-tray. In Chicago papers recently there was
an advt. for 50 pairs of elephants’ boots and
durable leather breeches. Through shooting the
chute the animals ’ feet were wearing out, and
their hides getting full of splinters.
Mrs. Praed —an English sister-in-law of the
Australian writer Mrs. Campbell Praed—has just
left Australia after a tour of its show places. A
wealthy girl friend was with her, and the pair
would appear to have been in little-trodden places
of the globe’s surface as well as over the regular
tourist routes. It is quite a usual thing to meet
in the city hotels and tourist hotels women
travellers in pairs, gentle-voiced or strident-
toned, as the case may be, who have been in
strange places in China, Japan, and India. Some
of them have been travelling constantly for five
or six years. One pair I encountered had
dodged summers for seven years. They wanted
only winters and springs—and they got ’em.
The kodak, the novel, the writing-pad, and piece
of fancy needlework are for ever at their hands.
They don’t look a bit travel-worn, and are mostly
calm, uninterested and uninteresting. No mental
processes would seem to go on behind their plea-
sant-looking eyes even when those eyes look upon
>the rare or thrilling in nature. They just kodak
it, or a bit of it, for Aunty Jane, who lives in
Bedford Square and hasn't travelled.
A picturesque young party has been the
reason for Phil May’s name cropping up. The
damsel was suing, in London when the mail left,
an iron magnate for breach of promise. The
horrid cross-examiner made her say that Phil
had given her a riding habit that cost £24, and
drawings that she had since sold for £6OO.
Which reminds that an American magazine
(Everybody’s) has an alleged anecdote about Phil
May. It tells that May was once down on his
luck in a backblock Australian township, and
driven to act as waiter at a bush pub. An
English friend recognised the artist, and with a
start of horror exclaimed, “What, have you come
to this?” “O, h ,” replied May ;“I haven’t
sunk so low as to have to eat here.” Somebody’s
been pulling Everybody’s tail. Phil May never
was down on his luck in Australia. He came
here under engagement to The Bulletin, earning
£2O a week to start with, and when he left was
making not less than £5O a week.
A returned Australienne, on Miss Bess Norriss,
the miniature painter:—“She will chat rapidly
and brightly all the time she is working—even
when she is painting eyes into the head of a por-
trait the jpize of a sixpence. When a little child
she would notice only the face of a stranger an
criticise its features. Her first work came when,
as quite a girl, she bought a shilling photo-
graph of Edith Crane, colored it, and then
some lady bought it for five shillings. _bhe
painted a larger one of the same artiste,
and put it in the window of a Collins-street
music shop, and it was sold for five guineas.
The colorist was so delighted that she at once
took a lair at five shillings a week, and proceeded
to live the life artistic in the Room Beautiful.
Plenty of persons desirous of being done on ivory
came along. Ranji was one of them. _ Bess
painted him and his pretty Yankee girl on
ivory the shape of a heart, and the gentleman
who now wants to be a Jam told her that if she
ever went to London to let him know.”
From Brisbane
In spite of the severe threat issued by the bridegroom
in the White-Macdonald wedding—a threat which silenced
the local dailies—certain details have leaked out. There
was no wedding gown, no wreath, no veil, no brides-
maids, and no reception. Miss Grace Robina, second
daughter of Alexander Rose Macdonald (Under-Sec.
for Mines), stood up to be married to William Duckett
White, eldest son of the late Ernest White, of Mudoombah,
in a simple white muslin frock inlet and frothy with real
Valenciennes, and a pretty white hat of equal simplicity.
She carried a lovely posy, wore (the bridegroom’s gift) a
diamond and pearl necklet and pendant, and looked as
sweet and bright as a Marcus Stone heroine. The family,
who are not wealthy, and know everyone, wisely decided
the “ all or none" querv in the latter way, and a quiet
lunch with the family followed the ceremony, after which
Mrs. White donned a navy cloth and silk rig-out, and set
off, looking like a rose, with hubby to Toowoomba en
route tor Sydney, where they embarked on board the
Grosser Kurfurst for a two years’ wedding tour in the old
world.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
Another portion of old Sydney disappears.
That part of Lower George-street, opposite The
Bulletin Office, comes down to allow of a
much-needed widening of the street.
The Bruised Myth crowd’s show-case
brand of nigger gets this pleasant advt. in a re-
port just issued by the India Office, dealing with
the ravages of bubonic (about 4,000,000 deaths in
eight years):—
It is not easy to deal with a religious tenet that for-
bids the holder to leave an infected place ; with a tender-
ness for animal life that will not sanction the destruction
of a deadly serpent; with an ignorance convinced that
plague is introduced and fostered by Government in order
to reduce a redundant population ; with suspicion that
sees the disseminating agents in every disinfeotingparty,
or with timidity that may be turned by an ill-considered
action into fanatical frenzy.
Meantime the Bruised Myth refers to this com-
bination of fanatical frenzy, filth and ignorance
as “our noble fellow-subject.”
That wail for “exemption for country
districts” bad to make itself heard in the
Amending Factories Bill which passed the Vic.
Assembly last week. The Act provides cumbrous
machinery for extending the determinations of
a Wages Board to shires. It was pointed out by
Peacock that Ballarat bakers had gone out to
Bungaree to avoid the minimum wage, and had
brought bread to Ballarat. However, these and
other facts did not prevent Wangaratta Bowser
from moving:—
But such determinations shall only be applied to such
shire or portion of a shire if the council of such shire
petitions the Governor-in-Oouncil to so apply such deter-
mination.
Fortunately, Victoria is growing tired of the
truculent demand of rural persons for exemption
from all manner of laws re decency, cleanliness
and order, and Bow-wow’s proposal was so con-
temptuously received that he withdrew it in
shame.
Beauty was at one time to the great majority of
women, as a thing beyond—a possession for which Nature
was alone responsible. That’s all changed now. With
the advances made in Beauty Culture it is possible for
every woman to have what at least is Beauty’s greatest
attribute—a fresh, radiant complexion. Mile. Helena
Rubinstein, the Russian Skin and Complexion Specialist,
has in every sense altered the face of Australia. Her
Valaze Massage Institutes, at 158 Pitt-street, Sydney, and
274 Collins-street, Melbourne, are equipped with every
device for the attainment of feminine beauty. The jaded
society woman, tired out with the incessant round of
entertainment, may, by the treatment of face massage at
these Institutes, be made as fresh as a rose again. All
the weary nerves and muscles of the face are soothed and
strengthened, the circulation of the blood increased and
all the pores spurred into their natural activity. Sittings
from 4s. 6d. Then the removal of serious beauty
blemishes is also undertaken at the Valaze Institute.
Birth marks, moles, ‘disfiguring growths, red noses, and
all the other list of hideous beauty ailments are removed
on the lines followed by the great continental specialists.
Of Valaze, that dainty Russian Skin Food, no word of
praise is needed. It is the boudoir belief of thousands of
Australian women. Other toilet specialties handled by
Mile. Rubinstein are Rusmo Hair Killer, for the self
removal of superfluous hairs; Valaze Herbal Soap for the
complexion ; Valaze Blackhead and Open Pore Cure ;
Valaze Skin Lotion. These articles are sold by chemists
everywhere, or direct from Mile. H. Rubinstein & Co.,
274 Collins-street, Melbourne, and 158 Pitt-street, Sydney

O&l of SHAPE,
MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 18, 1906.
My Dear Yarrie.—
There was a grand accumulation of infants at
the Northcote quarters, when the dame of the
ever-current smile took a dais stand with the two
be-ribboned terriers, several caddies, and the
G.-G. himself. Miss Greville loomed up close at
hand. The tall amiable English Miss, whose
brown hair has some wise streaks of grey (it is a
wise hue), looked on at the kids in polite amuse-
ment. There was a strong disposition on the part
of all the short-sock and knickerbocker fry to
shake the friendly paw of the two dandy terriers,
and to execute a mere bob for the benefit of the
Governor-General. But a rescuing aide coaxed
such loiterers on, and directed at least the appear-
ance of homage from the dogs to the hosts.
Mrs. Charlie Ryan, Mrs. Arthur Moule and Mrs.
George Chirnside were among those enrolled to
help keep the kids out of the fish-pond and off the
sacred strips of dais carpet. Mrs. Pursey Chirn-
side dressed up to full reception style, unlike the
others, who had allayed their chiffon ecstasies for
that young party. Several clerics floated about
the vice-regal scene, as if to provide grace after
much Punch and Judy. Mr. Edward Fitzgerald
was the one sample of bachelor helping the staff
of caddies to get through the frolics. He gave
much energetic assistance.
The mistake of spreading elderly or at least
grown-up refreshments before the hungry eye of
infanthood came home to my mind at that Y.R.
small coated spree. Sandwiches, brown bread
and other adult fodder filled the board. Even the
strawberries and cream were beyond the appreci-
ation of baby palates. The chef who concocts
serious entrees and dignified game for the official
appetite most of his time is not the kind of artist
to devise giddy and foolish dainties for kids.
There were bon-bons at the party, but they looked
advanced in years—more fit for Edwin and
Angelina than Tom and Tootles. There’s char-
acter, age and morals in food. Think of the
sobriety of brown bread—the youthfulness of jam-
tarts—-the dissipation of cherry pie ! Roast beef
is middle-aged and respectable. Quail on toast a
rather gay dish. A boiled egg has a democratic
character. A pancake is a mild Picwickian joke.
And a hot morning roll has a most improvident,
reckless reputation.
The Brodribb family were farewelled by several
sections of Toorak before they boarded their
lugger for a long gad. This little clan of sisters
leave a gap in the clever ranks. They were
studious and as ambitious of their technique in a
sketch or piano-piece as they were particular
about their accent in French, or their commina-
tions at golf. Th.ey believed in being earnest
about work or play. The result was that they
kept their minds and their bodies in the pink of
condition. The She who keeps her mind aglow
as well as her body is a Miss to be adored. As a
rule, the feminine mind is either pallid, or
wickedly purple, or miserably blue. The glad
pink mind argues sanity, good humor, and fine
b dance. It glows and makes the world a brighter
place.
The Sam. Gillotts have boarded a German boat
for a recruiting jaunt. The ex-Mayor is sick from
worry and sore from the slings and arrows of
outrageous Judkins, so he gets right away.
Judge Chomley left with one of liis tall and
learned daughters for the spiced ports of India
last week. Miss Chomley has wit and an ornate
mind—the kind that one would naturally associate
with the atmosphere surrounding a rather hand-
some and haughty Solomon. Judge Johnston
had likewise made up his mind (it’s a big one to
make up) for a jaunt and the ocean-cure, but
instead he goes a-shooting with the bachelor-
bencher, Justice Box. It is a good thing about
our Victorian Bench that the judges go away on
holidays together. I believe that in your N.S.
Wales the judges don’t talk to one another off the
Bench as a rule.
Most of the enthusiastic she-patients of Dr.
Helen Sexton rallied on the decks of the Moldavia
last week to say a final word of farewell. She
departs for the Cold Country. It’s the first
per.od of leisure Dr. Helen has billed for herself
since hanging her brass sign out in St. Kilda.
Dr. Sexton, principally because she owned the
indomitable name of Helen, persisted in polishing
hei brass plate and maintaining a hopeful de-
meanor until the feminine population of St. Kilda
and the neighborhood entrusted their appendix
and their backache Jo her keeping. Sh 6 mingled
good, womanly, wholesome advice with her pre-
scriptions, so that the Sexton practice (not the
sexton’s) gi’ew and multiplied.
Miss Olive Riley flashed on the firmament, the
other day, at an Austral Salon soiree. Miss Olive
practises hard at the top C, and is preparing to
shifie among the few legitimate stars of this State.
Before taking up his luxurious kit and flitting,
Rupert Clarke gave a final spree at Rupertswood
to the waifs and strays of Miss Sutherland’s
Home. The Gumming clan aided the host. The
Sunbury eyrie goes under the hammer. It’s an
idle residence. The mistress is an absentee and
neglectful he spends all his days in a dusty city
flat. •
The Victoria Golf Club has been cleeking and
fighting and putting for a silver mug or soup
tureen from G.-G. Northcote. He now and
then casts a trophy in the teeth of a club as a
reminder that, besides being a functionary, he’s a
sport. The Victoria golfers are the only ones in
this State to exclude femininity from their links.
Perhaps for that reason the latest to swing a cleek
at the atmosphere there is artist Alf. Vincent, who
made certain that no strenuous She was footing
the links before being sworn in as a brother.
Mr. Frank Stuart—the cheerfullest of garter-
merchants —voyages once again round the world,
or a large portion of it, not to pick up his health,
but to make sure that Europe, Asia and Africa
are still in the right place. He’ll meet abroad
Mr. Henry Butler, another cheerful softgoods-
man of fortune, who takes his impressive mate
on a leisurely gad about-the earth and several
bounding oceans merely to pass the time, and
to demonstrate that this State prospers.
A clan of Staughtons are among the recent
departures for London." The exodus from these
parts has started in earnest. Half Toorak has
dropped its blinds, and left the Chippendale
cabinets in bib and tucker for the hot spell. The
early year sees a shoal more mount the gangway
for abroad.
A particularly cruel story comes from Paris.
She was an American spinster of wealth, he a
confidence-man of infinite brass, passing as a
Baron. They met at Hongkong. She married
for the title, he for the money, and on the honey-
moon he decamped, taking all the money he could,
her jewellery, and—her umbrella. That was the
last depth of villainy.
Miss Edith O’Sullivan writes from ’Frisco
Will you kindly correct a statement concerning me
which appeared in Melbourne Chat recently. Same
describes me as, after the earthquake, “stoney broke,”
eating in soup kitchens, etc. I never did have to avail
myself of any refugee diet or tent. I went to Los Angeles ;
also, I cabled my people at once and assured them I
needed no aid financially whatever. I have had three
letters from friends in Melbourne offering me money. It
places me in a very awkward position. Far from being
stranded, I intend taking a six months’ jaunt to Aus-
tralia by way of Canada, returning to ’Frisco to re-
establish.
Mr. Henry Gyles Turner —one of the gay
litterateurs and philosophers—raises a protest
against the female rabble of the polling-booth.
Once, he admits softly, he believed in the rights
of the sex, but the cat scrimmages that ensued
when the psychological hour of the vote arrived
have sickened his sensitive soul, and, in a column
of print, he states the cold, unpleasant reasons of
his change of opinion.
Freak parties are the latest to keep Toorak
bloods in brisk circulation. At one of the kind,
recently, a large male went in the bib and tucker
of the Little Stranger, while a chic young Miss
advertised the straight-fronted armor of fashion-
able mould according to hoarding designs.
Toorak’s notions of originality seem always vulgar
or banal.
One swagger dame, who has no family, opened
her ballroom to the she-electors who were bur-
dened with babies on polling-day. They say
that once the fuss of receiving the infants
was over, the dame playing at the creche game
did not know what to do to keep the fry from
hunger or boredom. She probably gathered mul-
berry leaves for their morning meal and enter-
tained them with club gossip. And yet she is a
lover of birds and beasts.
The Rev. G. Robinson has married Miss Aggie
Thorn to a youth named Deery, hailing from
Harborville. He is a barrister, and belongs to
a family of much sovereign worth. The bride
secedes from the theatrical ranks for good. For
two or three years, Miss Thorn fulfilled the
promise of the Conservatorium. To retire from
the comic opera ranks to become a permanent
Deery seems a desirable thing. As a rule, one
is only dearie for the brief honeymoon spell!
A recent Sketch portrait of Alice Crawford
shows a tall, rather lean, and somewhat unattrac-
tive dramatic Miss. But her art improves. It
may be the usual case of Brain versus Beauty—
with Brain victorious. The pair are deadly
rivals.
It’s an age of cunning and devices. The newest
gamp-handles hold a scent or spirit cylinder. If
you’re the sort that dies away whenever things
grow monotonous, the smelling-salt bottle or
vinaigrette is at hand for resuscitation. If you
need periodical revivals from the intemperate nip,
the gamp-top contains the desideratum. It’s an
age of deceit. The complexion veil imparts
delusive bloom to the faded or Stilton-dabbled
cheek. The curls of adoption are skewered to the
thatch with captivating intent. The latest hose
is deftly designed in pale pink and brown or
black lines, so that the supporting limb takes on
a faint glow —a suggestion of a blush that must
convey a thrill to every watchful connoisseur.
The sex walks abroad, an alluring multiplication
scheme of decorative Sham.
Monsieur Lucciardi enlivened the bill of prize-
giving at the Alliance Francaise, last week, by
comedy —La Pretexte of D. Riche. The energetic
Consul has stimulated the Alliance to much
theatrical effort. Both recent comedy programmes
drew large audiences, and applause to match the
size.
Stonington has dropped its shutters for a
recreative spell. The Talbottles are away South,
seeing something of Tasmania. Priv. Sec. Victor
Hood is left to see that no daylight robber walks
off with the post of Governorship.
The She-Riflers of this hub entered a contest
with some college cadets, the other day. It was
an unequal match. The adult She, with a full-
grown aim and experienced orb, triumphed easily
over the small, knickerbocker shots.
The hat-curtains are extending to the hem of
the skirt. I saw a long, lean form advancing
towards me, the other evening, when the moon
dallied behind a cloud, and very little light made
beautiful the night. In the violet dusk the long,
shadowy drapes floating about her head and form
in ghostly procession looked like spectres. It
had an uncanny effect.
There’s an effort to rally women artificers to an
Applied Arts Society. In Sydney a brave little
band of these practical artists exist, and hold
exhibitions, and evoke encouraging aid.
The house-hunter should travel round in a dray
or a hawker’s cart or even an old barrow drawn
by a billy-goat, in order to impress the seller with
her cash limitations. Mrs. J. C. Williamson
went forth on a recent) visit to Melbourne in a
smart petrol car to buy property. The agent and
vendor, seeing the motor wastefully scatter the
dust of the neighborhood and the other para-
phernalia that doth proclaim the rich, sent the
price up pop, and mentioned a figure commen-
surate with tha prosperous style of the purchaser-
elect. Thereafter, she trammed it, and at least
got on to the scent of bargains.
Mary Ann has a new horror for her long-
suffering mistress. She leaves her-vulcanite plate
in the Dresden afternoon-tea cup, or the cream
basin, or the porridge dish, or any other handy
kitchen utensil. A marm related, with many
shudders, how one day her breakfast cup was
served up with Mary Ann’s teeth innocently
lying within. The whole family reared from the
sight like a spirited neddy, and breakfast for that
day was off. Later on, Mary Ann was granted
her conge. Yet she was a champion toiler, honest,
expert with broom and bucket, and she didn’t want
to flirt with the men of the house. (A Mary Ann
who wanted to flirt with the eldest son would
never have given away her front tooth like that.)
It’s difficult to know whether to put up with
Mary Antics of this order and endure the shock
of finding a plate of teeth in the butter-dish, or to
employ a haughty Marion with a wasp-waist and
a dimpled elbow, with whom the heir will elope
one of these days, leaving his Ma lamenting
inside her expensive frock.
After all, much of the feminine rapture over
roses is an affectation. Every She gushes at sight of
the gorgeous blooms in a dinner-table design. It’s
a good peg on which to hang pretty ecstasies.
Also, every She employs exclamations of the most
exalted and heavenly order when he of the poet
heart and pleasant profile points them out in a
sentimental hour. But in her heart of hearts the
ordinary feminine cares little for the beauties of
the rose. The best show advertised for years took
up all the space in the Town Hall, the other day,
and the attendance was feeble. For one sublime
noon all the glories of the champion nurseries and
lovingly-cultivated gardens were assembled under
one roof. It was an exquisite collection of blooms,
wine-red, blood-dyed, purple-stained, pink as the
faint day dawn, golden as sunshine, and mysteri-
ously shaded in a dozen glorious hues. And they
rioted together, stood straining to a rare height,
or lolling in luscious ease, or swooning in voluptu-
ous fragrance— to a few cataloguing brethren, a
few horticultural experts, and a dozen or two
cottage-gardeners. Women and poets mostly kept
away.
“Rosna” writes from Adelaide
The ’Varsity council and the ’Varsity students, who
have been exchanging unpleasantries for years, had a
final disagreement lately, so the undergrads absented
themselves from this year’s commemoration. The
students had been requested to make no allusions to the
Governor, Chancellor Way, or the size of the lady under-
graduates’ feet; also, it was suggested that the students’
programme should be censored. The undergrads declare
that they fainted in a body, and then decided to have
a commemoration of their own. So the official com-
memoration was a hollow blank, punctuated by prosy
remarks, to which comparatively few people troubled to
go. The undergrads, for their part, led a hilarious pro-
cession through town in the morning, and in the evening'
hired the Tivoli for a concert—and got 3s. and 2s. a head
for admission.
Two Adelaide damsels left by the Moldavia last week
—Misses Ada Martin and Mabel Haslam. Former of the
moneyed John Martin clan. Latter is well known as a
clever amateur elocutor. The same boat deprived
Adelaide Oonservatorium of pianist Bryceson Trehearne,
who has gone to take a hurried look at his native fog.
Hisgirleens sent him off with a new dressing-case. You
see, when Bryceson Trehearne arrived in these parts, he
brought, besides his name and his mane, a letter from
Edward Rex ; and that ought to be enough to command
even two dressing-cases on very small provocation.
Mrs. Charles Birks, the bright light of Adelaide
Y.W.C.A., who returned from a globe jaunt last week,
was, by way of welcome, presented by the Y.W.O.A.
with a cheque—wherewith to paint the outside of the
Adelaide building 1 Not to paint it pink, in a figurative
and rejoiceful way of speaking, but to actually paint it —
cover it with oil and white lead.
Elsie Jones, a South Australian who has been singing
her way through England and America for some years,
returns to Adelaide shortly to teach the young idea how
to warble.
From London :
Emily Soldene’s farewell appearance at the Palace
Theatre on Tuesday was altogether a unique affair. Not
even the dense yellow fog that penetrated to one’s very
marrow deterred her admirers from turning out in full
force. There was an odor of “ gum leaves” in the atmos-
phere, for everyone who was anyone from “down-
under”—a pet Soldenish phrase—turned up to do honor
to an old favorite. Melba, in grey velvet and shaded
grey feathers in her large hat, chaperoned her son and
his juvenile fiancee. Close by were members of the
Rothschild clan, whilst in a box near the stage sat Ada
Crossley with her hubby, the personification of happi-
ness. Mrs. John Ross (better known as Mrs. Phil May)
was also of the party.
General verdict that la belle Soldene is everg een. She
was a jaunty “Drogan” in linen kn e-breeches, silken
hose and satin shoes of white, with a white cap saucily
perched on her flaxen wig. What a roar greeted her when
she came on at first, really nervous. And whac prolonged
“coo-eeing” followed her duet with Violet Ludlow!
When she finished up with a top-note that would put to
shame many a modern singer, and advanced to the foot-
lights and “ salued ” in her old form of, I won’t say
how many years ago, she fairly brought down the house.
Beerbohm Tree announced that the benefit would realise
£BOO.
Great excitement over Melba’s son’s approaching
marriage. It’s fixed for the first week in December.
“ Mama ” has settled £l5OO a year on Georgie, who has
political ambitions, and who purposes entering the por-
tals of Westminster in the near future. “ Georgie ” has
not much to boast of in the way of looks, but the future
“ Mrs. Georgie ” makes up in that respect.
Melba’s frocks and jewels have caused much talk of late
in “ Traviata ” (alas 1 the diva is fast putting on flesh).
The earrings worn in the third act, great diamond-fringed
ones, were formerly the property of the Empress Eugenie.
Ada Crossley is being specially honored at the Lyceum
Club to-morrow; the Australian Circle hostesses are
giving a party in her honor. All Anglo-Australia appears
to be going. They do things well at this club, and the
handful of Australians are determined to keep their
native land well to the fore.
From Maoriland Exhibition:—
The Victorian Court, at the Exhibition, is holding up
its head bravely and quite living down the reputation of
its bungling beginning. It has one of the finest posi-
tions in the buildina—right opposite an imposing por-
ticoed entrance—the only entrance at which the city
trams stop. The management at the beginning was in-
judiciously chosen—doddering, and not enough of it.
Now things have changed. Just as a sample of dodder'-
ing management in its young days : There was some
gilt paint left over from gilding the inevitable obelisk
showing the yield of gold in the country since Noah, and
one part of the management had actually given orders
for the re-gilding of an antique Marie Antoinette casket.
“Just to freshen it up,” one of the Commissioners
seriously remarked.
N.S. Wales has bought £3350 worth of pictures from
the British collection at the Exhibition, and the second
buyer (for the arts and crafts division) has not yet
arrived. No Victorian art representative has put in'an
appearance so far. Mr. Du Faur, of the Sydney Gallery
said he only got an inkling of what the show was worth
about a fortnight before the opening ceremony. Du Faur
is a man of years—7l—but he quietlv packed his
suit case and bolted for Maoriland." “Did not
tell his dearest friend” he says, “in case Bernard
Hall should hear of it and get first snap.”
The collection, he thinks, deserves to have been cried in
the streets and shouted from the housetops. So good are
the works that Mr. Du Faur cabled to beg an anticipation
of next year’s grant so that he could plunge to the
farthest tether. He chuckles over getting firsjt snap, but
groans at Victoria’s extra £7OOO Felton money. Buyers
are arriving from every where but still nope from
Melbourne. The gallery committee there wants prod-
ding with the worst sort of prodder.
The commissioners and managers of all the courts in
the Exhibition rose up in a body a few days ago and
banqueted and cheered M’lntyre, the populan Director of
Exhibits. He has battled well through all the difficulties
in the final wind-up of Exhibition preparations. They
also bought him a gold 'watch as a memento, and handed
along a big sahk of .sovereigns to Mrs. M'lntyre {suppose
because she could not help being a jolly good fellow, too).
Yours Affectionately,
TRYPHENA.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Modern version : “I asked for bread, and
they called me a loafer.”
“ Let the fiscal majority have its way and
be done with it.” —Sydney Telegraph in its
agony.
The dwindling majority of Greid in East
Sydney :=-1901, 4052; 1903, 3795; 1906, 1210. If
The Bulletin knows G. Reid, he won’t risk a
1910.
The history of an Australian public work
naturally divides itself into two chapters :
Expectation : Oh, for a bridge 1
Realisation : Owe for a bridge.
One Anti-Sosh apostle who in public life
wails about “the sanctity of the marriage tie,”
is known among his acquaintances, not without
reason, as “the hub of the universe.”
There was nothing more graceful in
Conroy’s political life than his manner of going
out of it. About his last action was to emphati-
cally repudiate an Orange Lodge endorsement.
A return laid on the table of N.S.W.
Assembly shows that four large financial institu-
tions control absolutely, or under mortgage,
25,000,000 acres of leasehold land, mostly acquired
by the falling in of mortgages.
The wildest man in Queensland just now
is probably ex-Senator Drake. Anticipating a
Labor sweep of the polls, he retired from the
campaign, and now notes the galling fact that
three almost unknown “ Anti-Socialists ” topped
the poll.
The biggest shock of the elections to
Reidism was the discovery that it was losing its
hold on the block metropolitan vote of Sydney,
which for years has been dragooned by the daily
preas into dumbly following the rotund Reid.
In the last Parliament Hughes alone, out of nine
city members, opposed Reid, and it was a party
boast that Hughes owed his election to his Free-
trade views.
The Anti-Sosh party secured the A.B.C.
rooms, Sydney, on the night of the election, so
that the refined ladies and gentleman of their
party could hear the results of the poll without
mingling with the common people. Herald said
next day it was purely a social affair, and that
there were no speeches. It quietly suppressed
the fact that there were prepared speeches, but
they were put under the table when the polling
results came in.
REMEMBERED FROM THE ELECTIONS.
TORY CANDIDATE: “ I sympathise profoundly
with the worker. When I was a young man
I was a striker in a blacksmith's shop."
VOICE: “ Yah, if you were ever in a blacksmith’s
shop ye muster been the bellows.”
Sydney Herald (13/12/’O6) is now pre-
dicting Socialism for N.S. Wales in the near
future. On her authority, every boy barracker in
Sydney is for Socialism. The first return received
on polling day—Anti 952, Socialist 240—was,
Granny remarks, received in silence. Then
Socialism was announced 119 ahead for Gwydir,
and “all the boys cheered.” Later on a boy
yelled “ Labor for ever.” (Granny says he was
only a midget, too!) At South Sydney, the
Herald says the boys marched, waving banners
with “Vote for Watson” thereon. Those
youngsters are a prediction.
Australia’s proposal to give
preferential treatment to goods
brought out from England
in British ships, manned
by white crews, has
seriously upset the equa-
nimity of Thomas Suther-
land, great panjandrum
of the P. and O. Co. He
protests wildly in the
Times against the enor-
mity of any such legis-
lation. Coming oppor-
tunely on heels of the
wail from the P. and O.
Co. appear two most
instructive publications:
one, official statistics
showing that year by
year white seamen are
beingdisplacedin greater
numbers by Lascars in
the British mercantile
marine; and the other
an appeal from the
Marine Society of Lon-
don for employment for
“ thousands of good
seafaring men willing
to serve afloat if they
only could get engaged.”
It is for a policy that
produces such results as
these that the P. and O.
Co. demands protection
from Australian legisla-
tion. Thousands of our
own flesh and blood
starving and without em-
ployment, while Suther-
land and his black
friends grow fat on the
British taxpayers’ sub-
•idy.
The Transvaal has
appointed an “ Indi-
gency (Commission” to
inquire into the reasons
for pauperism among the
white population. The reason is easy to find.
It’s the prosperity following the war.
Senator Tom Playford is the only notable
Ministerialist to lose his seat at the elections. He
will not be missed. The old man did fine work in
his time, but his political term outlived his political
usefulness. He makes a gap now for a live
Defence Minister.
The only stain on the Labor party record
in N.S.W. was its selfish squeezing out of the
Protectionist candidates in such constituencies as
Illawarra, Nepean, and Robertson. The party
gained nothing by it, but Protection would have
won probably two of those seats from Reid.
Had the Laborites adopted Charles Atkins’
suggestion of months ago to come to an agree-
ment as to fighting certain seats they would not
have wasted their money and strength at Cooyong,
Ballarat, and elsewhere, and they would almost
certainly have won Batman, Indi, and Coran-
gamite.
While Wren’s special friend, Senator Daw-
son, was being driven to the bottom of the poll in
Queensland, ex-M.L.A. Bob Solly, Labor candi-
date for Batman (Vic.), was being slaughtered in
the constituency of the Collingwood tote, not-
withstanding the support of the tote-shop owner.
Solly, while representing the railway servants in
the State Parliament, made himself one of the
most conspicuous barrackers for Wren.
Queensland has, by protocol, a special
treaty all to itself with Japan, which can, and
should, be terminated at once by 12 months’
notice ; by the treaty Bananalanders in Japan
and Japanese in Bananaland have all sorts
of mutual rights and privileges,
a condition of affairs that ought
not to have existed for a
moment longer than was neces-
sary after the constitution ol
the Commonwealth six years
ago. _ Moreover, out of all the
treaties preventing a prefer-
ence to British shipping, this
appears to be the only one
which the Commonwealth (on
behalf of Queensland) can de-
nounce for itself, and the only
one the British Government
can’t denounce on behalf of
itself. Under which circum-
stances the least the Common-
wealth should do would be
to take its courage in both
hands, give twelve months’
brutal notice with as brave a
face as maybe, and await the
earthquake—or a naval demon-
stration. Fancy, too, the splen-
did example to Britain, and
the moral effect on the im-
perial preferential traders if
Australia showed the way in
denouncing treaties that prevent the preferential
treatment of British shipping!
Heard at an election meeting in Balaclava
(Vic.):-
The candidate : A most important factor is the vote of
the women. How are we to catch our women and make
them vote?
A woman elector: Put salt on their tails. (Loud cheers.)
N.S.W. Premier Carruthers manifestoed
N.S.W. electors to support Anti-Sosh candidates,
with the result that of the 25 contested seats 16
defiantly refused Carruthers’ counsel, and the
remaining nine voted heavily against Anti-Sosh.
On this showing, Carruthers the Deformer has a
cold polling-day coming.
“Here” (in the interference of British
authorities with Colonel Light’s selection of the
site of Adelaide) “was an example of a lesson
that England has never learnt—and I don’t know
that she ever will learn it—that to interfere with
the man on the spot is a fatal blunder.”—Gover-
nor Le Hunte, S.A. (in unveiling a Light statue).
The first trial of strength since Seddon’s
death ’twixt the Government and Opposition
took place at Onehunga. At the general election,
twelve months ago, the Seddon candidate was
returned by a 600 majority ; at the recent election
the Government candidate was defeated by 1200,
notwithstanding that the Lands Minister stumped
the district.
HARD LINES.
BRIGG : “If Smith absolutely refuses to support
you, and you must do something, why not go
back to your old game as barmaid?”
MRS. SMITH: “I can't do that either. Before
we were married any of the hotels would
employ me in order to get my husband’s
custom, now none of them will for fear of
losing it.”
Had Dawson not intruded in the Queens-
land Senate poll his votes would have been
divided among Higgs, Lundager and Griffiths,
and given them a majority over the three Anti-
Soshers. Similarly, had the odd man Playford
not been a competitor for Labor-Protectionist
votes in South Australia, Crosby, Blundell and
Russell would have submerged Symon, Charleston
and Yardon. Of course, there was reason in
Playford’s candidature, none in Dawson’s.
The Melbourne bricklayers’ strike brought
to the surface the fact that Victoria possesses
a Voluntary Conciliation and Arbitration
Act. Everybody had forgotten all about
it, for it has been a dead letter from the
day it was passed, 15 years ago. Yet it
was that sort of Act and that sort of
arbitration that G. Reid advocated the
other day. A humbug of smaller calibre
than G. Reid would have said that there
is no more need of an Act to tell men
they can arbitrate if they want to, than
there is of an Act to tell men they can go
to bed if they want to and if they have the
bed. The thing that the public needs is
an Act to tell the parties to arbitrate
when one of them doesn’t want to, just
as it wants a civil court to make Jones
pay Smith’s bill even if he would rather
not.
The earnestness of the men and women
behind the Federal Labor leader was shown by
the fact that a crowd numbering several thousands
of both sexes waited patiently outside Redfern
Park till midnight to cheer him. The Redfern
Town Hall chimed a new day as Watson, from a
balcony, announced his thanks.
The night before the 12th Jimmy Graham
told a mixed meeting of Redfern supporters and
opponents that he had the Labor leader beaten,
that Watson had regretted coming to South
Sydney, and that he (Graham) would beat him by
a thousand votes. Then he called for three
cheers for himself —quite like G. Reid.
Maoriland is beginning to speculate as to
who will be the next Premier, for it is not ex-
pected that Joseph Ward will worry about the
position after the next Imperial Conference in
London. He has achieved considerable wealth,
and it is said that his wife has social ambitions.
Probability is that he will fade away to London
as High Commissioner.
The G. Reid party in the Reps, lost some
of its best men at the elections. G. B. Edwards
(who stood down) was a tower of strength because
of his quiet capacity and his general decency;
Sydney Smith was an ideal whip and organiser ;
M‘Cay, an energetic wire-puller with no par-
ticular scruples, who really engineered the down-
fall of the Watson Ministry.
’West’s great vote against G. Reid proves
that a stronger man would have sent Yes-No into
obscurity. West is an excellent fellow, and his
courage in tackling the Anti-Sosh leader was
admirable ; but he isn’t a bright platform speaker,
and Reid will only be beaten by a man who can
outface him on the platform. Either Hughes or
Watson would have killed G. Reid stone dead.
Sydney’s Mayoral election this year was
marked by a curious incident. When heads were
counted it was found that 11 aldermen voted for
Hughes and 10 for Allen Taylor. Hughes voted
for himself, but Taylor, who occupied the Mayoral
chair, refrained from voting. Hughes was de-
clared Lord Mayor for the ensuing year, and the
Council had adjourned-, when he was accused by
several aldermen of having agreed to pair with
Taylor, and he explained that he had, but had
forgotten all about it. He withdrew his vote,
and then honors were easy. Hughes was then
elected to the chair on Taylor's casting vote.
E. Wilson Dobbs writes :
Your reply to Answers to Correspondents,"
B. 6/12/’O6), re the Merchant Shipping Act, while correct
so far as it goes, does not go far enough, and therefore
leaves quite a wrong impression. For, on June 4, 1903, a
warrant was issued by the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty authorising the flag adopted as the merchant
flag of the Commonwealth of Australia to be flown by
vessels registered in the Commonwealth. Thus for three
and a half years past the Australian flag on Australian
ships has been authorised.
Probably the Labor party begins to feel
sorry it helped to reject Deakin’s Contingent
Voting Bill, cumbrous though that measure was.
Such a provision, or a Second Ballot, would quite
likely have given the party three more seats in
Victoria —Tndi, Mernda, and Laanecoorie. As it
is six Vic. members will sit in the Reps, on
a minority vote —Wynne, Matthews, Wilson,
Brown, Salmon, and Harper.
The dramatic departure of Gillott from
Vic. politics is another proof of the effect of an
Imperial title on a full Australian stomach. No
Victorian has quite survived knighthood ; even
Alexander Peacock, who, as plain Alex, looked
like being a force, has degenerated into a me 'e
cackler. Evidently our public men have dis-
covered the danger. There is a great falling off
in the demand for titles, and there is not one
prominent man who is openly angling for a bauble.
The Bulletin gets this little testimonial
from an Anti-Socialist, who seems to have a pain
in his temper as a result of the election :
The dirty, scathing, foolish, wicked and low remarks
and illustrations that have been put into your dirty paper
for the last few weeks have given me a good idea of w.at
kind of beasts work to earn a livelihood at your office
and it has satisfied me that curs of your stamp will be
well punished at the proper time, and I (being an influ-
ential gentleman) will do all I possibly can for the total
ruination of your dirty paper.
Anti-Sosh has reason to be proud of its
Labor-helping record in connection with Victorian
Senate elections. In 1903 it had a nightmare that
led it to yelp from the housetops that Laborite
Findley was “disloyal.” Disgust with the
yelpers led to a swelling of the Labor vot* by
many persons outside the party’s ranks, and
Findley went into the Senate with flying colors.
At the recent elections Anti-Sosh made miserable
and unfounded assertions that some of Tunne-
cliffe’s writings propped up their Marriage Tie
myth. That produced for him a huge vote of
sympathy. To ensure results satisfactory to it-
self, Anti-Sosh really ought to change its tactics
by praising the Labor men.
“Billy” Hughes wasn’t too comfortable
this election for West Sydney. All his supporters
were massed in one district, and their attitude
was of the “ you’re-all-right-Billy ” order. But
the re-division of electorates had flung into his
constituency a frenzied group of sectaries nour-
ished on Wilks’ ideas; these people, clustering
around Blackwattle Swamp, within easy smell of
the abattoirs—a place which reeks like a very
unwashed congregation in a very crowded Bethel
on a very hot day—suit their politics to their
atmosphere, and are Orangemen, or women, all
the time. Their solid vote for Burns, and the
apathy of Hughes’ supporters, gave quite a false
complexion to the result in West Sydney.
THAT AUSTRALIAN RACING INSTITU-
TION, STEWARD BOB, OF THE V.R.C.
Bent nearly passed through Vic. Leg. Ass.
a Bill patterned on Irvine’s Strike Suppression
Bill. It was a Disorderly Meeting Prevention
Bill, and proposed that proceedings might be
taken against any person who made a row at a
meeting by any other person at it. The chairman
and police were relieved of all liability in con-
nection with the removal of persons; so the
chairman might chuck out and have arrested any-
body he chose and be free from liability. Pren-
dergast fell on the Bill tooth-and-nail, and had
clauses struck out.
REFORM WITHOUT REVOLUTION.—The great
and particular merit of Hunyadi Janos is that it
relieves without discomfort; in other words, it effects
reform without revolution. This is because it is the
best and safest natural aperient.*

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The best news of the week is that N.S.W.
Legislative Council has frustrated the attempt of Joseph
Carruthers to make betting on coursing grounds legal.
The Anti-Gambling Amendment Bill proposed to foster
brutality and cruelty by legalising a pastime that did
nothing to improve the muscles of men, while it did a lot
to brutalise their minds. There are few things more
pathetic than the scream of a hare when the grey-
hound closes on it, and the horrible part of
the business is that the hares are coursed again
and again till they are at last caught. For long-
drawn-out cruelty coursing ranks with the Death by a
Thousand Cuts, favored by the Chinese authorities. It
has absolutely nothing to recommend it, and, as one
member said, “ was untit for present-day civilisation, and
on a par with bull-dog and cock-fighting. ,, As a matter
of fact, it is worse. In every one of those sports the
losing animal has a chance, even if it is a small one, but
in coursing the hare has no chance, and at best
can only escape to be hunted to death another day.
The moral atmosphere of the community would be a lot
sweeter if someone would now take legislative action to
put down pigeon-shooting. In this writer s opinion,
pigeon-shooting is illegal. It is exactly the same as
Yankee-grab: each competitor contributes so
the sweepstake, and the winner takes the lot, and if that
is legal, so ought two-up to be. There is no real differ-
ence between them, except that two-up is the much more
decent sport.

The performance of the N.S.W. team at
Adelaide was distinctly disappointing, and but for A. J.
Hopkins's 120 not out would have been something like
a failure from a N.S.W. inter-State team. Wrights
bowling was deadly—six wickets for 91,runs. Diamond,
Noble and Cotter were expected to make more than 26,
20 and 82 respectively. But they didn’t, and Hopkins
(120 mo.) and E. L. Waddy (63) were the only two who
played up to form. It was quite a new experience for an
N.S.W. inter-State team to be dismissed from the wickets
on the opening afternoon, and but for Wrights bowling
would not have happened.
E. L. Waddv’s innings is described as ‘‘reck-
less,” but apparently he concluded that the B «£ e
playing of the other chaps was working out »o badly that
a little recklessness might do good. And it did. He hit
nine fours, and was at the wickets 68 minutes, so allowing
him a little time to breathe on his hands, he scored about
one a minute. Hop.’s score included 14 fours and one
six, and he was at the wicket from about 2.30 till stumps
were drawn. Cotter played his characteristic game,
swiping wildly. He only lasted 20 minutes, during
which he hit a six and four fours, and then he drove one
high to MVBfeath, who held it. #
Saturday’s 'first-grade cricket in Sydney saw
Victor Trumper resume practice as Master of the Bat.
He strode on with a businesslike air, and from the first
his work was artistic. For two solid hours he placed a
languorous game, placing fours with elegant ease, and
scored 172. Two sixes and 22 fours accounted for a
centurv He gave two opportunities during his innings.
In stfite'of a perfect light and splendid wicket there was
nnlv one other centSry scored in Sydney first-grade
cricket on Saturday; Gallagher carrying his bat for IOS for
oiphe a train st University. His score included II fours,
and was a most display of cricket Another
man who clayed a fine game was H. M. Stephen, oi
Sydney, who made a ferocious attack on Redfern bowl-
ing, hitting 17 fours, and scoring 87.
The afternoon saw some lovely bowling. Reid
sent down 12 overs and took four wickets (including
Trumuer’s) for 49 runs. Goddard, of Redfern also did
well aoainst Sydney, bagging five for 31, while on the
oimosite side Mulligan’s two for 19 was easily best. But
the dandy performance was that of Addison, of Gordon.
He knocked down three of Middle Harbor’s for 7 runs.
MThillamy, of North Sydney, took 5 of Balmain s for 53.
A ,T Hopkins performed so indifferently in
e-ride cricket this season that some critics proposed
drowning him from the inter-State fixtures. In his two
inn ncs against Queensland and South Australia Hoppy
knocked up 291 for once out, and in the latter fixture
Sled his Tide out of the mud. As a player who is not
afraid of risks, Hoppy is always a favorite with the
crowd. # „ «
O’Connor and M‘Beath, the two bowlers hired
bv S A. from Sydney, have so far had very little success
in the field, valuable as they may be as coaches. The
match against Victoria was lost unexpectedly, and the
iPsfridt•clubs to which the two men were assigned lost
every game they played. M’Beath’s club, North Adelaide,
is particularly disappointing., He was assigned to it
because it was lowest but one on the list last season, and
thfs year it has not won a match at all; yet it is mostly
made up of inter-State mem-Claxton Pellew Reedman,
Oowan, P the brothers Rees, and M’Beath himself.
Adelaide’s one big school cricket match has
ended n a win for St. Peter’s, which needed it badly.
Dolling who had over-shadowed everybody for several
years—he made 312 in 1904—lias moved up from Prince
Alfred College into the S. A. XI. * „
Interest in Melbourne cricket continues to be
slight the only circumstance of note being the threatened
“ arrival ”of several young players. Good bowlers are
almost as scarce as genuine Freetraders, though Goss erst
of Richmond, and now playing for East Melbourne,
shows pleasing promise. T’other Saturday he captured
seven Robing wood wicketsfor 26, while the persistent but
ineffective Laver collared two for 25. Armstrong recovers
his form likewise Ransford, who lately compiled 118 not
out against Saints. Tuckwell, of Melbourne, knocked up
111 in the same match. Victoria is aweary of the old
brigade that, with occasional variations, has battled so
lon| and fruitlessly for the Sheffield Shield and is now
Placing its hopes on these youngsters, likewise on
Le Conteur, of University, who made 185 n.o. against
Richmond in first-class style, and T. Horan, son of the
ex-Australian Eleven man, who turned Hawksburns
threatened defeat at the hands %Carltonintoadiawby
smiting' bowlers Saunders and Green for 80, attertney
had snapped four wickets for 15. Every day Horan
shapes Slike a chip of the old willow, in a manner
of , , *
The English Amateur Cricket team at Auck-
land did not set Waitemata harbor on fire. In their first
innings the Englishmen made only 172, and the Auckland
XT resDonded with 195, leaving the English 23 behind.
At time of writing England has 4 wickets down for 62
runs The only outstanding feature of the play was the
bowling of Englishman Simpson-Hayward, who took 6
wickets for 39 runs. t m •
Sailing people in Sydney were much interested
in the Prince Alfred Club’s 42-mile ocean race for the
Basin Cup on Saturday, which took place over a course
from Fort Denison in Port Jackson to Lion Island in
Broken Bay, back to Shark Island in Port Jackson. The
impressive feature of the contest was the handicapping,
only 2min. sseo. separating the first and third boats, and
but 42sec. first and second. It was a pretty contest.
Heather, standing well out to sea and making a long
stretch down the coast, got the eastern breeze. Unfor-
tunately, the port shroud parted, and much time was
lost effecting repairs at the back of Lion Island, other-
wise the race might have ended differently. As it was,
the all-conquering Rawhiti sailed home 42sec. ahead of
Oulwulla, with Heather 12sec. behind, and Scotia in
fourth place.
* • • •
The Basin Cup was an inspiration. The Club
was camped at the Basin, Broken Bay, and one night
over cigars Harry Cox, of Gosford, suddenly an-
nounced his intention of putting up a “ Basin Cup,’
worth 20 guineas, to commemorate the pleasant time
they had put in at that delightful spot. A. R. Marks,
N. H. Murray, and A. C. Saxton donated seven, five, and
three guineas respectively to complete the prize list.
Curiously enough on Saturday Mr. Murray won Mr.
Marks’ prize, Mr. W. M. Marks won Mr. Murray’s, and Mr.
A. R. Marks got Mr. Saxton’s.
* • • *
Sydney Sailing Club provided some fun on
Saturday afternoon on Port Jackson. Of 13 starters no
less than seven were lost en route : some were swamped,
some were disqualified, some capsized, others got locked
together and blown away, and the others retired. Under
these circumstances people began to lay odds on Aus-
tralian and Donnelly in spite of the fact that both these
boats were severely handicapped. At the Lightship
Stella was in front and followed by Donnelly, Federal,
Arawa, Mona, Australian and Zena. Then Mona retired,
and Australian went after Donnelly, which was after
Stella. At the finishing line Donnelly was still 48
seconds behind Stella, with Australian two minutes 11
seconds behind the second, and Federal fourth.
* * • *
Looks as though track-cycling is a decaying
industry. The Austral Wheel Race, with a prize-list
of £3OO, drew only 60 starters; and the Westral Wheel
Race, the big affair of the Western State, drew only J 7.
When these entries are compared with those for road
events over longer distances for smaller prizes, the slump
looks colossal. The explanation is that the ‘ heat
system is in disfavor with the cyclists, who reckon they
have to lose a lot of time and provide a lot of amusement
for the public at a very small return. Even the Mel-
bourne Cup would wane in popularity with both owners
and public if it were run off in 10 heats and three semi-
finals and a final. The agony is too long-drawn-out.
» * * *
The Austral Wheel Race final, on Saturday,
was Thomas’ night out. At seven minute past eight
that speedy youth won his heat in the “ Derby the
Blue Riband Mile International Scratch ; at 8.60 he
pocketed £lO by winning his Austral semi-final from
Millard and R. W. Morgan; at 9.20 he acquired £2O, a
silver badge and a blue ribbon by gathering in the Derby
final from Larry Corbett and C. A. Best; at 10 p.in. no
raked in a further £l6O as Austral winner; and at 10.17
this insatiable cyclist bestrode his machine once more
in an attempt to collect the £lO attached to the
Talbot 6-mile Plate, finishing ultimately a bare foot
behind Bestel—£lB4 and sundries for the evening’s work.
The Austral was a great race ; one has almost to go away
back to the days, of Tom Busst, in ’9O, for a finer finish.
What the Ikeys thought of the prospects was evidenced
by the betting—2 to 1 Thomas or Hehir, 4to 1 Morgan,
7 to 10 to 1 others —but there was little wag r ring, and it
was very muc i sub rosa. The time was 3'59 4-6, previous
best being A. J. Clark’s 416, in ’O4, and he had 130 yd. less
to go than Thomas. The spectators didn’t number more
than 8000.

Compared to reliable steering-gear nothing on
a motor-car really matters ; nearly every bad smash of
late has been traced to defective steering gear or bad
steering. The latest tragedy was the killing of Mr.
Grainger last Saturday afternoon, when his car was de-
scending* Lapstone Hill(N.S. W.). The machine bolted, then
at the critical moment the steering gear went wrong, and
the utterly unmanageable car crashed into a rock. Mr.
Grainger was killed, apparently instantaneously, by a
large jagged wound in the back of the head.

The Dunlop Rubber Co. is considering the idea
of inaugurating an Inter-State Cycle Military Despatch
road race from Melbourne to Sydney. The idea is that
certain portions of the country between the two capitals
shall be regarded as held by the enemy in force, and that a
circuitous route should betaken to avoid the main body
of the enemy and its patrols. The cyclists will, if the
event transpires, be sent away from Melbourne in the
dark, and get over the 62 miles of good road between
Melbourne and Seymour by night. After that the track
will lead through Albury, Tarcutta, Gundagai, Yass, and
Goulburn to Sydney. At the start a military despatch
will be handed to each of the riders, and the first man to
hand his document to the military authorities in Sydney
will take the prize. Riders will be allowed to ride when
and how they like, but must sign on at specified town-
ships to prevent the use of trains. No outside pacing
will be allowed. Each rider will be given a book of
coupons, with which he must pay all his expenses on
the way, and the Dunlop Co. will redeem the cheques
after the race. The Bulletin doesn’t see the use of
having this sort of contest for cyclists. It would be a
more useful test from a military standpoint if the ma-
chines used were motor-bikes; in war-time only the
power-driven machine would be used for such work.
, * * *
The latest infliction of the round-tlie-world-
without-funds sort is a Scotch cyclist named Liddle, who
last week left Sydney for Maoriland. He started
from Capetown in December, 1905, and since then
has done an amazing amount of travelling by steamer.
Tea thousand miles are said to have been traversed by
bike and the gentleman relies on the generosity of
cyclists and steamship owners to see him through. This
form of “ enterprise” wants severely suppressing. It s a
curious fact that any number of people who wouldn tpart
with a sixpence to save a starving woman’s life will enter-
tain a great hulk, who ought to be at honest toil, indefi-
nitely, if he is doing something useless “ for a bet.
The Dunlop Rubber Co. has just erected a
plant by which pneumatic tyres of any class or size can
be inflated to any degree of pressure required in a very
few seconds. This will be of great value where large
tyres such as those of motors, are concerned, saving
not only labor, but giving pressure to the exact degree
required. The company offers the use of this inflater
free of charge to motorists, cyclists, or users of any class
or make of pneumatic tyre, and no doubt its enterprise
will be availed of by motorists.*

Judging by the recently-published statements
of two big English motor-building concerns, the Daimler
and Humber companies, the trade is a lucrative one.
The Daimler Co. has a capital of £192,368, and in 1903 it
made only £7334 ; in 1904 the figures crept up to
£B3 167, and last year soared away to £213,470. The
Humber Co. is a ‘private concern, and its capital is
apparently not known, but it announced its profit on
last year’s business as £106,558. The manufacture of
cars is practically non-existent in this country, but there
is no reason why, with the aid of a decent tariff, it
should not be considerable. The two concerns which
will build a car to order in Australia have to make a
living by the sale of imported cars, although they will
both turn out more durable conveyances from their own
factories if purchasers desire them. It has been argued
that the demand in Australia is not large enough to sup-
port an industry, and yet Canada, with only a million
more people, supports several factories, and is actually
exporting motors to Japan and China. .
Recent Automobile Speed Carnival at Black
pool, England, proved a triumph for Dunl°P Tyres. O
the 22 races, 17 were won on the vwld s PF™’ leaving
and out of a possible 66 prizes, 48 fell to
only 18 prizes to be divided among four other makes oi
tyres.* # , ,
The contest for the 300yds Swimming Cham-
pionship of N.S.YV. at the Bondi Clubs
Saturday last did not give any hint that this Statens
likely to produce another Kieran ini t _ an d
Kieran’s time for the distance was3ni . - v cjl u b

Naturally the 500yds. Flying Squadron Championship of
the Eastern District clubs produced much fastei tra
ling the winning team (East Sydney) covering the
distance in smin. 43 3-ssec. ,
Ladies’ swimming clubs are still booming in
Sydney, no less than three of them holding conMßta
oil Saturday. In the Balmain Cadies Club, starters,
timekeepers, check-starter and judge were all ladies.
Whieh may explain the remarkably fast times put up.
The decision of Towns and Durnan to row on
the Nepean course is a knock top Pgri amatta Rive
people, P who looked upon the offer oF£lOOO by the Penrit
people as mere guff and cheap ad. However, it is quite
evident that the Nepean people have put up somemoney,
although the large amount mentioned does seem
somewhat incredible. What probably weighed largely
with the rowers was the fact that they will be able to
collect a larger gate from a much smaller crw d on the
Nepean. On the Parramatta all Sydney and his wife
would be there in his own motor-boat, his own buggj,
and all his other private conveyances. On the Nepean
the men who are putting up the show reckon they will be
able to levy toll from five out of every six who watch the
race. But in that they are probably wrong. The dead
head is as übiquitous as the rabbit. #
The Australian loves a horse—but some of him
have a queer way of showing affection. Two Ararat men
lately drove their prads on a trotting match to Lake
Bola'c and back, 64 miles 1 The 32 miles out were covered
in 21ns. 23mins. ; then the merciless drivers urged the
staggering beasts along until within three miles from
home, when one dropped dead ; the other succumbed
shortly afterwards. It is hard to suggest punishment
heavy enough to meet such a case.
“The Date”: Gunga Brahm has not fallen,
merely dropped on his knees to weed onions. He is now
an onion king growing the juicy fruit in Gippsland.
“Homo’': The football or racing enthusiast in
following the movements of his favorite team or gee-gee
unconsciously goes through some spirited evolutions.
Often have I seen excited punters crouch and spring as
their deceased bird rose at a fence in the steeplechase,
and settle down again as he landed clear, with the strain
on their mental apparatus visibly and audibly relaxed.
I’ve likewise known ardent barrackers to violently assault
the atmosphere, and deftly manipulate an imaginary
football as the excitement waxed intense. I once in this
way received a vigorous kick in my sitting department
from a fervent Collingwood supporter who was urging
the “Magpies” to victory at a critical moment. On
another occasion, while craning my neck to see my
defunct fowl pass the post first, an excited individual
with grass-seeds in his whiskers leaped on my back, and,
hugging me fiercely, dug imaginary spurs into my sides
with his heels as he uttered vehemently, “Goo on,
Bobadil, clc, clc. Stick yer blanky head out, Bobadil,
’n’ ’y’ win, clc, clc.” Bobadil had run a dead heat with
something else, I subsequently learned.
“Cash”: “Confiding citizens who write to
newspapers for theatrical information to ;decide a wager
are likely to get the wildest of mis-statements in return.
(B. 25/10/’06.) Strike out the limiting word “ theatri-
cal,” and I am with you. I once wagered two sep rate
pounds that it is easier to fill a flush than a straight, if
vou hold four towards them. The matter was referred
to a Great Australian Weekly, which replied that nine
cards will fill the flush, while there are only eight that
will make the other ; then it lost its mental balance, and
ended up, “ thus the straight is the easier to fill.” Well,
I paid up, of course, but asked my opponents to suspend
judgment while I wrote to the paper to point out that its
correct figures proved the foolishness of its deduction
from them. Next week, it made a sort of grudging
apology for the “ obvious slip,” and —my men being

“Kink”: Have just put in Show Week at
Turtleville, and have at last found a church on which
Providence smiles. Went to the Charity Fair run by the
local R.C. Church, and speculated (on the sly) to become
the possessor of a sovereign that was being raffled at Is. a
member. Took a ticket, and noticed it was numbered
206. The raffle closed with 250 members, and I wagged
my ears to hear my name called. When the waiting
crowd heard that the Church had won the coin they
wagged their heads in a satisfied manner. They belonged
to the flock ; I didn’t! Anyhow, I tried my luck again for
the self-same sovereign. The list closed with 159 mem-
bers. Again the Church proved victorious in the draw.
Then I went forth, and bought a bottle of ink, and a pen,
and a writing pad, and some stamps, and wrote to Jud-
kins, Tregear, Woodfull and Worrall. I am no longer
one of the sheep ; I am now a battering-ram branded
“Jud.”

Heavyweight battles in Melbourne are usually
very sudden affairs, and the spectator gets the shortest
kind of thrill for his silver. Bill Squires, haying dis-
posed of his one-time friend and adviser, Bill Smith, in a
fraction of a round, it was reasonable to suppose that the
people who come to pay and remain to curse would be off
big men’s battles—temporarily, at least; but they rolled
up again in large numbers to witness Peter Kling versus
Bill Lang at the Cyclorama, and this time they were
rewarded with rounds. It was another brief business,
but what there was of it was excellent. The two men
fought hard while together, and, although the expecta-
tion was that the Sydney-sider would give an easy
account of Lang, the latter was easily on top in all the
fio-hting. Lang had been led to dread Peter at close
quarters, but when it came to half-arm pasting, he was
decidedly quicker, more evasive, and more effective than
Klino- The end was most unsatisfactory, the Sydney
man being given out for a foul in hitting when coming
from clinches, a trick allowed in Sydney, seemingly, but
opposed to Basto’s reading of the rules. It is impossible
to say how the fight would have gone, as Kling, although
well punished, was still very capable; but, as far as it
went, it was easily Lang’s on points.
Gambling —some gambling —m S Africa is
a dangerous misdemeanor these times, -the
Transvaal Government Gazette of 21st JNov.
last year offered £3 reward for the recaptuie of a
prisoner who had escaped from Boksburg prison.
The fugitive was an Australian, age 27, height
sft 2iin., and a list of his distinguishing marks
suggests that he must have been preparing him-
self for a picturesque appearance m a side-show :
Small scars on neck ; two vaccination marks left upper
arm ; tattoo marks left upper arm, bust of woman flower,
and pot; right upper arm, woman s bust with_childl,_four
birds and flowers ; right forearm, woman with flowers and
pot • on chest, man on horseback ; five men s heads round
neck ; flowers and birds left thigh ; right
thiffh: flowers, pot, bird and butterfly left calf, two
women right calf; birds and women left instep ; bird and
w» "'earing brown moleskin
prison breeches, grey Stockings with red rings, white
flannel shirt, all marked with broad arrows and B.P.
Was undergoing sentence of six months imprisonment
with hard labor, imposed by the Assistant Resident
Magistrate, Boksburg, for gambling on the 15th Nov.,
1905.
Evidence in the Upton-street (Sydney)
slum-murder case has revealed that the wife often
begged the police to place her violent husband
under arrest. The police reply was, it seems,
addressed to both, and meant they should go into
their house and shut the door. That happened
once too often, and she is now charged with killing
him as a protest against his attempts to throttle her.
The theory of non-interference with domestic
brawls can be carried too far.
At Carnarvon, one of the oldest pastoral
districts in Westralia, and about the windiest
place in Australia, they have pubs., but never a
church. Recently a meeting of persons, vaguely
described as church “ supporters,” was held m the
leading pub. ; it resulted in a shake all round lor
drinks and promises of a fiver a head, provided
the church was built for the use of every denomi-
nation represented. Among those present were
a Jew pearl-buyer, on his way up to Broome ; a
Scotch Presbyterian; a bullock-puncher, who
struck “one of Tatt.’s” last year; an ex-Wes-
leyan local preacher; a Bible Christian, and a
High Churchman. What kind of church this
composite crowd will hatch is still puzzling the
rest of Carnarvon. Meanwhile, the Koman
Catholics have chipped in with a neat little con-
vent school.
The sad plaint of “ F. 8.”
The creature who takes advantage of her sex to strike
and insult a male worm who cannot hit back at her calls for
some public contempt. In this instance she was a female
who had built her hair up and had posed an immense
Tower of Babel edifice on the erection. She and two
others sat themselves down at the theatre and completely
blocked the vision of the male creatures behind, one
youth ventured to expostulate, and the gentle creature
turned with a sneer and smacked him—quite lightly ana
flippantly, but still smacked him—in the mouth with her
programme, and calmly sat, blocking the stage-scape as
before. The man blushed painfully at the coward s biow,
and subsided into his chair till he could muster courage
enough to grab his hat and escape. If she had been
Goliath, he might have given her one in the jaw, even n
he had died for his rashness. A man can but die once.
But as it happened to be wearing petticoats, he had to
swallow the insult. And it’s a poor consolation to feel
that some other male will probably “do’ six montns
hard for paying the creature back, blow for blow. Its
not every youth that can take a smack in the mouth
•ven from a woman.
Australian fortune-builders appear to be
losing the tender feeling for those “ above them,
once characteristic. When a partial millionaire
of the old time received notice to drop his bundle
at the heavenly gate he used to pick out a Gover-
nor, or Supreme Court Judge, or some other mag-
nate and bequeath him a bit of the treasure. One
of the finest houses on the Rocks came that way
into the hands of one Judge, while other occu-
pants of the N.S.W. Bench admitted that wind-
falls, as they called them, substantially added to
their incomes. Andy Thompson, of the Hawkes-
bury, quite set up Governor Macquarie. Governor
Gipps was bequeathed several solid sums, and a
late Chief Justice was handsomely remembered
in the wills of one or two affluent dead. .Now
Australians worth half-a-million or a million slip
off without leaving a Governor even the price of a
drink.
“ M.D.” on nurses’ hours ;
The eight hours for mechanics I believe in certainly.
But why not an agitation on behalf of the nurses! We
have young women, during a somewhat criticaUphase of
life called adolescence, working in hospitals amongst all
sorts of diseases, wounds, and filth, at an occupation
certainly laborious, and demanding the exercise of great
judgment, tact, and patience, for from ten to twelve
hours per day—in many instances more.
For three years I was resident medical officer at various
metropolitan hospitals, and have known of nurses attend-
ing to special cases for 24 to 48 hours at a stretch Of
course such cases were somewhat exceptional. I have
also known of nurses going on duty at 6 a.m., and
beyond snatching a meal or two during the day, not
being off duty till 11 p.m. and midnight. Also of pro-
bationers, a few weeks after entering on their training,
being put on night duty alone in a ward with fully
twenty patients to attend to.
Few people outside hospitals realise the unpleasant
duties a nurse often has to perform. A patient is brought
in by the police in a filthy condition—perhaps suffering
from a contagious and highly septic disease. At any
rate, often very dirty. She is handed over to nurse, who
has to remove the filthy garments, bathe and clean up
the patient generally, including toe and finger nails,
which are always deep in mourning. All well-equipped
hospitals have wardsmen to give the preliminary bath in
the case of male patients, but nurse has to do the rest.
Another duty which the nurse has to do is that known
as “ laying out ” a corpse. Is it any wonder that many
probationers give in? I can cite numerous instances
where they have knocked up after a few weeks at the
hospital, and returned home completely heart-broken.
Yet three shifts a day could be worked just as easily in
hospitals as in mines or anywhere else.
No doubt the committees of the various hospitals will
raise the cry of no funds or accommodation for the extra
staff required, but this does not justify sweating as it
undoubtedly does exist in hospitals.
Won’t some humane legislator come to the aid of an
over-worked and neglected section of the community l
It must be dons by legislation.
ANOTHER CLERGYMAN
Proclaims the Merits of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills for Liver Complaints.
The Rev. David Milne, who for many years
has had charge of the Presbyterian Church at
Yea (Vic.), advocates the use of these pills not
only in the following testimonial but personally
wherever the opportunity offers.
He says:—“l have much pleasure in stating
that Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have been my
sole medicine for many years, and I can confi-
dently say that they have given me more relief
from liver complaints than any other medicine 1
have ever tried. I have recommended them to
many people and they have always found them
efficacious. (Signed) D. Milne, Clergyman. _
Among the thousands of testimonials received
from all parts of the Commonwealth and JSew
Zealand are many letters from men and women
holding high positions, who for various reasons
do not wish their names published. Ihe pro-
prietors of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, how-
ever, decline to publish any testimonials without
the full name and address as this is_ the only
guarantee the public have of their genuineness.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a perfect
blood purifier, and a positive and permanent cure
for biliousness, indigestion, constipation, head-
aches, sallow complexion, liver and kidney
troubles, piles, pimples, boils and blotches and
for female ailments.*

N.S.W. National Art Gallery Trustees
have produced a worthy catalogue of their collec-
tion of pictures, illustrated in black and white,
and three color plates. The literary work of the
catalogue speaks much in praise of President Du
Faur and Secretary Mann, and the printing of the
book is excellent.
The great Zig-Zag, on the Blue Mountain
railway line (N.S.W.), which has served for many
years as a picturesque advertisement for the State,
is at last doomed. Parliament has adopted a
motion to abolish it. The job will cost about
£400,000.
The quaintest surprises about the Victorian
section of the elections concerned the rejected
rather than the successful candidates. No less
than nine lost their deposits, three being Foreign-
traders, two Ministerialists, One a Laborite.
Among those who came within an ace of losing
£25 was the regrettable Max Hirsch, who was
one of five wooers of Wimmera. This anti-
Australian could attract the farmers so little that
they gave him barely 1900 votes against Pro-
tectionist Sampson’s 7500 odd. There was a
quaint episode about the candidature of Hirsch’s
fellow-competitor, Leslie, a Mallee Anti-Sosli
farmer. When the first returns were posted in
Oollins-street, Leslie had scored one vote to
Sampson’s 166 and Laborite Taafe’s 137. The
crowd laughed, “That must be his own ! ” The
next return gave the figures 795, 338, and Leslie 2.
“Ah ! that’s his wife's vote !” and a yell went
up. Another return, and the figures ran 943, 353,
Leslie 3. “ Hooray ! The family’s lining up
now !” The next return, putting Sampson in the
thousands, gave Leslie 8, and —“Ah ! His com-
mittee hasn’t deserted him after all.” Poor Leslie
finally managed to score 150 or so —which must
have cost him about £1 per vote.
“Philo”: Re nomenclature of Australian
towns. Most of the names of country towns are
more or less corruptions of aboriginal words,
descriptive of characteristics of the places. Here
are some names, the origins of which are not
generally known, and which I have chosen from a
long list published in an old and rare book,
entitled “ Australian Languages,” written by the
Rev. William Ridley, of Sydney University, and
published in 1875 : Wee Waa, from the aboriginal
Wi-wha, meaning “fire cast away”; Walgett,
from Wolger, high hill ; Gundemain, from
Gundimaian, house on the stream; Breeza,
from Biridja, place of fleas; Barwon (River),
great, wide, awful; Brewarrina, from Buri-
Warina, trees (scrub acacia, commonly called
briglon) standing up in clumps ; Namoi (River),
from Namai, place of the namai tree (a variety of
acacia) or from narnu, breast (the river curving
like a woman’s breast); Boggabri, from Bubbiberai,
place of creeks; Gunnedah, from Gunida, place
of white stones (others say “ place of destitute”);
Culgoo, running through or returning; Yalaroi,
from Yarrularai, having stones ; Manilla (River),
from Munila, round about (this river forms almost
a circle); Coghill, from Kaghill, bad, nasty
(water); Fallal, from Balal, hare ; Molroy, from
Murrowolaria, having hedgehogs; Pokataroo,
from Bukkitaro, river going wide; Pilliga, from
Bilagha, head of scrub.

THE
FOOD
ROUTE
Is the safest way to steady
health.
Many people are kept ill
because they do not know how
to select food that tbeir own
particular bodies will take up
and build upon.
What will answer for one
will not do for another.
If one is ailing it is safe to
change food entirely and go on
a plain simple diet say,
CooKed Fruit,
Dish of Grape-Nuts
and Cream,
2 Soft Eggs,
1 Cup Postum Coffee,
Slice of Toast,
no more.
Man! but a diet like that
makes one feel good after a few
days use.

On the morning of the elections Sydney
Telegkaph urged employers to see that their
employees voted, “ and if they can influence
their votes, so much the better/’ The morning
after the elections the same Telegraph was very
bitter because some Labor people, it alleged, had
attempted to “influence” their employees, the
shopkeepers. It wasn’t simply a case of the
biter bit; it was a case of the biter bit and bitter.
Melbourne Paunch reached the nadir of
lying when, in its special election number, it con-
cluded an article, “ The Immorality of Socialism,”
with—
What is the name for a man who avows himself a true
Socialist, willing to share everything—
wife—with others?
What is the name for a woman who will vote for a
Socialism that makes her and her sex the common
property of all?
Laborites in Port Melbourne have just
made a huge mistake. Melbourne City Council
proposed to gather Port Melbourne and South
Melbourne in to the Greater Melbourne that is
steadily growing up?.'.‘Both ..Councils were in-
clined to agree, butjjthe Labor party ip Port Mel-
bourne Council stands in the way. It is eaten up
with the terror* that the Greater Melbourne
Council will extinguish it altogether. It wouldn’t;
but if it did, what matter? The Melbourne City
Council is composed of Tories—real hardshell
Tories. But, at the same time, Melbourne City
Council, in its acts, in its management of the
municipality, is more Socialistic (and more
honest) than any other body in Australia, and is
rapidly getting into line with the Glasgow
Council —the most Socialistic municipality in the
world. These Tory Councillors don't call it
Socialism. They call it business. But it
is the same thing under another name.
Their methods are radical and modern. The
other day they cheerfully scrapped £BO,OOO worth
of electrical machinery because it was out of date,
and just as cheerfully started a sinking fund to
scrap £105,000 worth more in five years, when
that would be out of date, too. Result is that the
municipality is making huge profits. It can make
more profit still if it can extend its business, and
so it wants Port and South Melbourne and
as many more suburbs as it can get. These
will share in the success, for they will all be
“Melbourne.”

Joseph Carruthers has elastic notions
about truth and facts, and things like that. He
accused Opposition leader M‘Gowen, the other
day, of having helped to pass a Municipal Bui in
the early hours of the morning. Investigation
showed that the Bill was passed at 4.30 p.m., not
•4 30 a.m. Carruthers then dismissed the matter
airily. “ Was the hon. member going to make a
crisis over a matter of p.m. or a.m. ?


Screamed with Pain Suffering
Nearly Broke Parent’s Heart—
Twelve Years of Misery Doctor
Called Case Incurable —Helped
from First, and
SPEEDILYCURED BY
CUTICURA REMEDIES
“I wish to inform you that your
wonderful Cuticura has put a stop to
twelve years of misery I passed with
V
my son. As an in-
fant I noticed on
his body a red spot
and treated same
with different rem-
edies for aboutfive
years, but when
the spot began to
get larger I put
; him under the care
of doctors. Under
their treatment the disease spread to
four different parts of his body. The
longer the doctors treatedhim the worse
it grew. During the day it would get
rough and form/like scales. At night it
would be cracked, inflamed, and badly
swollen, with terrible burning and itch-
ing. When I think of his suffering, it
nearly breaks my heart. His screams
could be heard down stairs. The suf-
fering of my son made me full of misery.
I had no ambition to work, to eat, nor
could I sleep. One doctor told me
that my son’s eczema was incurable
and gave it up for a bad job. One
evening I saw an article in the paper
about the wonderful Cuticura and
decided to give it a trial.
“ I tell you that Cuticura Ointment
is worth its weight in gold; and when I
had used the first box of Ointment there
was a great improvement, and by the
time I had used tjae second set of Cuti-
cura Soap, Ointment, and Resolvent my
child was cured. He is now twelve
years old, and his skm is as fine and
smooth as silk. Michael Steinman,
Brooklyn, N. Y., April 16, 1905.”

From Jabez Pudkins, who says he is a
deacon: —
Passing down a city street, the other day, dear brother,
I observed a large gathering of people streaming into a
small office, depositing each a little parcel and a silver
coin, and departing with a receipt. The stream was so
steady and copious that I perceived there must be some
considerable business at the back of it, so I inquired.
These people, alas I were all sending small parcels to an
evil-minded corrupter of men named Tattersall, at
Hobart, and I recalled that our Postal Department used
to do a similar profitable business with that person at 5d. a
time instead of 3d.—but that the moral sense of the com-
munity decided to put a stop to it. And now, alas . it
seems that the mcral sense has merely put 3d. into some-
body else’s plate when it might have got 5d. in its own.
The loveable Chow of the Piebald Aus-
tralia advocates has a way of going back on a sick
mate that would be scorned by any white man.
Mrs. J. F. Bishop, writer of various books on
travel in China, tells how one of her Chinese
carriers fell sick unto death in the course of a
journey. “Though he had been a companion of
the other men for many days, they had no care
for him,'’ and Mrs. Bishop was “laughed at for
taking the trouble to wet a handkerchief to lay
on the feverish forehead of a man who was of ’ no
more use.’” Charity guilds are common in
Chinese towns, but if disease overtakes a man
who is beyond coo-ee of a guild’s front doorstep he
can just die. “Personal kindliness and care for
the sick and dying,” summarises Mrs. Bishop,
“ do not characterise the people of China. If a
man is sick to death he is of no more use, and
why should time and care be wasted on him ?
The way of the bush Pill is hard, and un-
paid bills blow like leaves about his path. Wit-

and the swindlers who robbed me in the past.
DR. J. J. O’DWYER.
In doing this (publishing a rogue’s list), I do very
earnestly seek for an action (by each and every pick-
pocket of them all) in the Supreme Court or any other
court of the State, but solely in the interests of public
honor, honesty and integrity of the community amongst
whom I have lived for over twenty leaden
“ Wang” : Be the cigarette-card collect-
ing craze. The other day I met Brown in the
street. Brown is a humorist —at least, he says
so—and he started to tell me a funny story.
“Yes,” related Brown, breathing whisky, “and
she winked at him and said” “Got enny
cig’rette cyards, mister?” murmured a voice
somewhere down near his knees. “Get,” cried
Brown, when he had located the disturbance. It
got. Then he took up his narrative again. “Well,
the peach put her arm around his neck and said ”
“Got a cig’rette card to spare, mister?”
A shrill cry sounded as,Brown’s boot smote the
interjector hard. “D-ash the kid,” murmured
Brown, and proceeded : “The girl was sitting on
his knees, and tickling him under the chin, and
she said ” “ Have yer got enny cigarette
cards, mister?” What Brown said wouldn’t look
well on paper. Then his wife came along, and I
didn’t hear the rest of the story.
“ The Stoker,” from Westralia : —
All this talk here about secesh comes from a really
small portion of the population, and that portion is
mostly composed of the old Groper—a class that has ever
I, ee n noted for its phenomenally narrow outlook, its
hatred of t’othersiders, and its dislike of innovations.
The most striking characteristic of the old Gropers is the
patience with which they sit down and wait for the
unearned increment, cursing meanwhile the people whose
presence caused the sand patches to go up in value by leaps
and bounds. The older the Groper the more he sits down
and the more he wants his land to leap up. They are
Protectionists only as far as the other States are con-
cerned, and are quite willing to admit anything British
or German duty free. It is no use to tell them that
Australia must be united for de ence purposes ; they say,
“England will look after us.” They can easily be de-
tected when walking the streets on account of their feet,
which they lift unusually high. This habit they con-
tracted through pottering ankle-deep in the sand for
years, and they still retain it, even after the t’othersiders
have paved their footpaths. It is hardly likely they will
do anything beyond complaining about “ State rights ” ;
though some do say that Fred Banger and his bell-
toppered horde are only waiting for the Federal capital
to be fixed, and then they will march on it, and pull down
the unbuilt city with their teeth, and set the grass on fire.
“ Number 0 ” writes :—
I want a number. I want “ to be registered and num-
bered as an organised Australian.” I want an arrange-
ment whereby I can go to the nearest registrar of births,
deaths and marriages, and obtain from him, free of
charge, a number which will be the official recognition of
my Australian citizenship. I want that number to be
recorded against my name and address in an Australian
Government Register. My name is (say) William Jones,
but I am not the only William Jones, even in my own
little town, and the postman, the banker, the electoral
man, and others mix me up with the other William
Joneses, because they can’t help it.
I want to be William Jones J56213, and I will be
prouder of the figures than I would be of such letters as
K.C.M.G. I would be the only person in the Common-
wealth entitled to claim that number—it would be my
own —given to me by the nation I am proud to belong to.
My name with this number would be legibly engraved
on my watch-case or some other imperishable article
which I always have with me. My wife, who also wants
a number, will have hers transferred to her wedding-ring.
My number, thus recorded, used and carried, will be
useful:—
1. To enable the postman and other officials to know for
a certainty that it means Me. (Others with uncommon
names need not use their number so freely.)
2. As a means to immediate and positive identification,
should I be found wholly, partially, or more or less dead
or seriously injured, or drunk.
3. As a strong presumptive proof, when I am away from
home, that I am really the Jones I say I am to the police-
man, the publican, or the pawnbroker with whom I have
business.
4. When I go globe-trotting, to give me a chance to
explain that J56213 at the end of my name means that
that is the registered number of my citizenship of the
Great Australian Commonwealth, and then to add casu-
ally that it is “ the best blanky land I Have struck in my
travels so far,” or words to that effect.
5 (and upwards). In a great many other ways that will
occur to people whose names are mere Jones or there-
abouts.
For obvious reasons the law would have to make it a
less heinous crime to kill a policeman (say) than to use
a false number. Otherwise, when the police next raid
Wren’s tote, they will be given numbers which will turn
out to be those of Judkins, or Woodfull, or Bishop Some-
thing, and so complicate matters.
For a start this registration should be compulsory for
all Federal and State officials and optional for others.
Those who voluntarily registered and used their numbers
would prove thereby that they acknowledged themselves
Australians, and wanted that fact known—also that they
had an identity that need not be hidden. Those who
applied early would get the low numbers with few figures,
and the lower the number the more it should be valued
by our grand-kids, to whom the watch or other heirloom
bearing it would descend.
By prefixing the initial letter of the surname to the
number, 26 groups, each starting from one, would be
formed, so that seven figures would not be reached (un-
fortunately) this generation, at any rate.
Has such registration ever been attempted by a young
nation starting from scratch—not Old Scratch—and which
contained a fair amount of patriotism ?

Purifies the Blood.
, trr , . “Stirton, Southsea.
Kutnows Powder is most refreshing and clears the system
of Uric Acid, and acts on the Liver and Kidneys. I have
recently been very ill from Rheumatic Fever, and since I have
taken it I feel a great deal better, and I firmly believe it is- a
grand blocd purifier.
“A. GRAHAME-HARVEY.”
THE INTESTINAL BATH
AND HOW
Kutnow’s Powder Cleanses the System.
The body is a form through which a stream of matter flows, or at least should flow. But un-
fortunately many people are greatly troubled with stagnation in the alimentary canal, which is
termed “ Constipation.” The constipated man is like a stagnant pool from which noxious odors
arise, while the active man with clean intestines is like the mountain stream, bubbling with
activity. To insist on eating without insisting upon getting rid of the debris is to pay the
penalty of natural law. The food becomes poison, the body is not only like a stagnant pool,
but becomes even like a cesspool, ready for the germs of disease. The once energetic, shrewd
and brainy man becomes weak, vacillating, and incapable. He is haunted by a perpetual
dread of some impending evil—he knows not what. The blood thus poisoned gives rise to
imperfect digestion. Dyspepsia, biliousness, liver disorder, excessive uric acid and constipation,
all proceed from irregularities of the digestive organs which affect the nerves and irritate the
brain. Kutnow’s Powder clears the brain and renders the body physically fit. A dessert-
spoonful taken before breakfast will thoroughly cleanse your system, and invigorate you in the
most refreshing manner.
REMOVES ALL YOUR LIVER TROUBLES.
How to Detect
Fraudulent Imitations.
The genuine and original Kutnow’s Powder
is strongly recommended by all leading
physicians for the stomach, liver, kidneys,
and bowels. You can obtain it at all con-
scientious chemists throughout the world.
See that the fac-simile signature, “S.
Kutnow & Co., Ld.,” and the registered
trade mark, “ Hirschensprung, or Deer
Leap,” are on the carton and bottle. You
will then avoid imitations and know
How to get Genuine
Kutnow*s Powder.
Captain Barclay writes :
“Kirsteen, Cisbury Road, Brighton.
“ I am very unwilling to testify that things
have worked wonders, but really I cannot
speak too highly of Kutnow’s Powder. I
have suffered for years from constipation and
liver troubles. Your Powder has done all
that it claimed, and, more than that, it has
given me comfort. I have since taken two
bottles, and have to-day sent an order to my
druggist for three more. Its action is sure
and gentle, and at the same time certain,
without any distressing effects.
“ Faithfully yours,
“R. BARCLAY (Capt.)”

"A POLICY FOR THE COMMONWEALTH/'
Post Free 6d. from “Tfae
Bulletin ” Office.
The Bulletin receives two documents,
one a tract with a picture of a dark woman
squatted in a dark land against a dark back-
ground of hut, and an inscription below her
setting forth that the dark woman is “a sitter in
darkness,” and the other a bill of fare. This is
the william of fare :
CONGRESS LUNCHEON AND TEA-ROOMS.
Price List.
Luncheon (including tea or coffee) .. 9d.
Salad 3d.
High Tea 9d.
Afternoon Tea 4d.
Lemon Squash, &c 4d.
The profits from this Refreshment Room will be de-
voted to the funds of the Missions to Melanesia and New
Guninea.
About which this paper merely says that it
doesn’t grudge any almost-nude “ sitter in dark-
ness” all the affluence that can be legiti-
mately made by supplying afternoon tea for 4d.
It looks like a pathetic little effort to do good.
The trouble about such efforts is that, in the
struggle to save something for the black woman
out of the 4d., the white girl waiter is generally
so overworked and underpaid that she loses
all interest in the Scriptures just as her colored
sister begins to reach out and cautiously paw the
sacred book. It suggests the case of the wonder-
ful penny or twopenny Bible which good people
in England turn out for the heathen, and to do it
at the price the wages of the white girl book-
binder are cut down to a point at which she
couldn’t live if it wasn’t that she supplemented
her miserable earnings by the wages of prostitution.
Whafc 0. E. Russell has to say in his
Everybody’s Magazine articles about the
Tobacco Trust and the commission of inquiry
makes good reading :
Senator G. F. Pearce, one of the low, common persons
of the Labor party, presided at the head of the Federal
Commission. Other low, common Senators sat with him.
To an American their work had rather unusual interest
because the thing they were examining is one of the
boons we have conferred on mankind. When the Ameri-
can Tobacco Cos. had beaten the American retail tobacco
dealer into a proper pulp of humility and subservience,
it crossed to England, reorganised itself under a con-
venient alias, absorbed all the leading British manufac-
turers, and spread its genial influence through the
British Isles, ruining tradesmen and crushing competi-
tion .... and at last descended with its familiar
tactics upon Australia. .... Two great Australian
firms united to resist the invader, and
for purposes of stronger defence, they formed a stock
company. . . . One day, the Australians awoke to find
that the Tobacco Trust had quietlv secured a majority
of the new company’s stock. . . . After that, the Trust
merely repeated the processes that had swelled its
dividends and skinned the consumer in America.
Senator Pearce directed the inquiry ... he never raised
his voice nor lost his temper. . . . Representatives of the
Trust, coached by the ablest lawyers in Australia, con-
tinually endeavored to hinder and delay the inquiry.
. . . Once or twice somebody would think to be merry
with him,'because he is a low, common Labor person.
Upon such a one he would turn two keen analytical eyes
... the jester seemed rather ashamed of himself ... but
he never browbeat anybody, never spoke with harshness
or vehemence ... the report of the Commission was a
marvel of thoroughness, clearness and accuracv.

we apply Electricity to cure this complaint.

every case undertaken. It never fails to cure when recommended. . . . To the men who have defied
the revenging power of Nature and overstepped the bounds of prudence ; men who, from the result
of wear and tear upon the machinery that creates the Vital Force of the body, have become weak,
puny, nervous, and dyspeptic ; men who are lacking in confidence and ambition, and those who are

bago, Varicocele, Rupture, and the many other evidences of decay of the vital force, WE OFFER
AID. We can cure you with Nature’s great power—ELECTRICITY, and make you feel well and

m less than three months I was cured
That was over eighteen months ago, and have not been troubled since.'
Mr. G. HALBEISCH, of GANIVJAIN, N.S.W., writes : “Dear Sirs, —When I first got your Belt I became dissatisfied
after using it a few times.' Probably 1 expected too much in too short a time, so I obtained some medicine and left the Belt off. The
medicine, however, did me no good, so I determined to again adopt the Belt, and I have always been glad since. This was two years
ago, and lam still well and strong, having been completely cured. I hope other sufferers will be as successful.”

THE PILLS -5
have gained their wonderful reputation by sheer force
of merit, because every person who uses them
recommends them to others. They have positively
no equal for thoroughly cleansing the system and
putting the liver and kidneys in functional order,
without pain or griping. They are the best known
remedy for Indigestion, Biliousness, Headache,
Dizziness, and the common condition of ill-health
known as “run-down” or “out of sorts.” Females
of every age find Holloway’s Pills an invaluable
remedy and aid.
THE OINTMENT
is known throughout the world as positively the
best and quickest remedy for Bad Legs, Old
Wounds and Sores, and Skin Eruptions of every
kind, and should be used in conjunction with the
Pills. It is also the speediest remedy for Rheu-
matism, Lumbago, Pains and Stiffness in the
Limbs and Joints, Backache, etc. For pains and
Soreness at the Chest, and -for Throat and Lung
Complaints arising from Cold or Weakness,
Holloway’s Ointment affords mo** welcome relief

The part of Berry’s estate which the
administrators want to trade off o» the State of
N.S. Wales for £IOO,OOO, is valued for municipal
purposes at £25,000. So says the North Sydney
Town Clerk. What’s the matter with a prompt
re-assessment for municipal taxation, and! a prompt
collection of a whole tower of arrears ?
Of the 62 estates in Maoriland which are
■over the £50,000 limit that the new Land Bill
proposes to make illegal, 25 are situated in
Canterbury, and 24 in Hawkes Bay (Hawkes Bay
is one of the smallest of the provincial districts),
and the other five provincial districts share the
remaining 13 among them. This simply means
that the graduated land-tax incidence is not
nearly heavy enough ; the land in the two districts
where the big estate rages most furiously is so ex-
ceptionally valuable that it pays to part with the
tax and hang on to the property. With all this
weight of land monopoly on its chest Canterbury
need no longer wonder why it has failed to keep
up with the other provinces in the rush of
population.
Suttor, N.S.W.’s paid agent in Japan and
the Philippines, has written to Premier Carru-
thers, pointing out that people at Manilla are
importing beans and onions, and he (Suttor)
would like to know whyN.S.W. doesn’t supply
them with these vegetables. Asa matter of fact,
N.S.W. also imports beans and onions for its own
consumption, and the expensive agent ought to
know a little thing like that.

CADBURY’S
ABSOLUTELY
PURE
Says "I find if more nourishing and sustaining than any other.'
All who use it speak in equally high praise of its sterling qualities.
r Whether your life is spent in the open air, undertaking tests of strength and
endurance, or in the equally arduous duties of the office, workshop, home,
etc., it is imperative that you should take an abundance of pure liquid food.
Amongst Hquid foods, CADBURY'S COCOA occupies the chief place •

Baldness
is Curable.
VERY few people believe it)
possible to get their hair
back when once it is lost.
Let me assure these that
where a “down” exists on the
scalp nothing is more certain than
that this down can be made to grow
into strong healthy hair with the
aid of “Capilla.”
Not one case, but thousands, have
come under my notice, and I have
fet to meet with a failure ; in fact,
am now so confident of the hair-
growing possibilities of “Capilla”
that I will forfeit £lOOO to any per-
son with a down on that bald spot
if the proper use of “ Capilla” will
not make his hair grow. “ Capilla ”
is designed both for the prevention
and cure of baldness. It keeps the
scalp healthy and clean, prevents
dandruff and premature greyness,
and stops the hair from falling out.

the latest market reports this is bound to continue. All these pieces of fine Diamond Jewellery were

SOOTHES THE SKIN.
Zam-Buk Soap brings Joy and Happiness
to Mothers.
The valuable qualities of ZAM-BUK MEDICINAL TOILET SOAP,
as applied to its use in the daily bath for the soothing, comforting, and prevention
of skin ailments of Children, are essential to play an important part in their
future good Skin Health.
The chief troubles of the young babe from its birth are the various forms
of skin troubles that attack it owing to the delicate and sensitive nature of the
skin, which is so prone to become sore and chafe. Milk crust, thrush, rash, and
other distressing skin affections, common among young children, especially those
of feeble constitutions, cause the child pain, fretfulness, and restlessness, and
the mother worry and anxiety.
It is dangerous to use Common Toilet Soaps (which are mostly impreg-
nated with poisonous substances) on the delicate skin of a baby. The health of
the child depends largely on its daily bath, therefore the best medicinal Skin
Soap should be used.
ZAM-BUK MEDICINAL TOILET SOAP is a perfect combination of
medicinal properties for the prevention of skin disease in young or old. It is a
Skin Tonic and Food, maintains the delicacy of the skin through its action in
conjunction with the natural oil, removes all impurities, and soothes and
comforts. By its daily use in the bath or toilet, good skin health results.
Don’t use inferior soaps that ruin the skin. Zam-Buk Soap is a Pure Medicinal
Skin Soap. It gives a delicacy and refinement to the skin, and prevents disease.
The great virtues of Zam-Buk Soap entitle it to a place in every home.

How to Cure Scalp Troubles.
Zam-Buk Soap is especially useful in the scalp diseases of
young children. Crop short the hair, dress freely with the
well-known Zam-Bulc balm night and morning, apply it well
to the scalp, afterwards rinse and lather with Zam-Buk
Medicinal Soap, This treatment regularly persevered in will
combat the worst case of scalp disease.
It will arrest mattering, ajlay the horrible irritation, and
by degrees heal the sores up, and leave the scalp sweet, whole-
some and clean. The rich, creamy lather from Zam-Buk has
also a stimulating effect on the hair follicles, and the hair once
devastated by disease is naturally restored to its old glossiness.
In cases of eczema, pimples, blotches, chaps, cold-sores,
chafings, chilblains, sore lips, ulcers, baby’s sores, ringworm,
Zam-Buk Soap achieves the most satisfactory results. Used
for shampoos it gives a glossiness and richness to the hair,
stimulates the hair-follicies, and arrests or prevents the hair
falling out or turning prematurely grey.
Have ZAM-BUK SOAP on every vvashstand. A tablet costs Is. or a
dainty box of three tablets may be had for 2s. TOd., of all chemists and
store.-, or for same price direct from the Zam-Buk llfg. Co., 39 Pitt-street

Business, Robbery, etc.
Ihe report of the Public Health Committee for
Marylebone (London) contains the results of analysis by
the medical officer of samples of canned food manu-
factured in America and this country. “The chief
fault,” says the medical officer, “lay in the American
brawns. Six samples of brawn derived from Chicago
were filthy, containing - dirt, bits of straw, woody fibre,
hair, hogs’ bristles, shreds of skin with the bristles
attached, and other matters, giving one the impression
that some portion of the contents was made up of floor-
sweepings. One sample derived from an English firm
was almost as bad. A sample of corned beef derived
from Chicago Was also very dirty, and two samples
contained much gristle, fat, and skin.”

There are many glaring anomalies in the scale
of wharfage dues levied by the Sydney Harbor Trust.
Potatoes are charged at the rate of 2s. 6d. per ton ; maize
gets off for one penny per bag, or lOd. per ton.
F.E.O. : Writer, having worked in some of
the largest sweets factories (never heard them called
“lollies” outside Australia) in England and America,
would sooner tackle a tin of Chicago horror than a pound
of those attractive-looking, imported toothache-pro-
ducers. Glucose, held by many medical men to be a
direct producer of diabetes, and prohibited now by the
American law, forms nearly 50 per cent, of the tasty, soft
creams and succulent fondants. Amongst the various
coloring agents used to produce those beautiful tints
may be mentioned chrome yellow, carbonate of copper,
&e., most of them irritant poisons. Some of the ingre-
dients used in the making of liquorice goods and dark
toffies would bring the blush to the cheek of a Chicago
pork-packer, the least harmful feeing- the refuse and
sweepings of the floors. Gelatine goods are gelatine in
name only, the common or garden glue, as used by the
Chow furniture makers, being much cheaper. The high
flavor and smell are easily killed with the aid of coal-tar
essences. Even the sugar, cheap as it is, I have known
to be mixed with such foreign substances as terra alba or
Derby-stone ground fine, and in cheap lozenges plaster of
Paris helps greatly to make up weight. The careful
parent, before purchasing too largely his stock of sweeties
for the youngsters, would do well to place a few' in a glass
of hot water (pure sugar is perfectly soluble in w'ater)
and then w atch the result.

In spite of the lack of local encouragement,
Australian ingenuity seems to turn fondly to war inven-
tions. The Brennan torpedo is an established instance.
Now there are before the British War Office a new' rifle,
a new big gun sight, and a new torpedo or submarine of
Australian design which have at least won to the stage of
serious consideration.

“Philo” : The artful wandering pirate sidles
up to his victim in a bar or on the street, and, sadly con-
fiding- to him that he is “ stoney-broke,” produces a new
razor from a box, on which is printed, in gold lettering,
“ The Razor, 10/G.” The 10/6 is particularly
golden. He spins a plausible story of bad luck, and
winds up by offering the gem of a scraper for 3s. 6d. The
victim only uses it once ; for the razors are bought at
about 7s. per dozen, and put up in specially printed
boxes. The same trick is w'orked with fountain pens,
honestly worth, retail, about Is., and sold for 2s. 6d. Of
course, they have a twelve-and-sixpenny aspect.
Interesting correspondence throwing light on
the “ honest business methods ” of daily journalism (and
on the value of international exhibitions):—
“ To Mr. H. A. Zelamina, Kelly-street, Scone, N.S.W.
“ With reference to your exhibit in the N.S.W. court
at the New Zealand International Exhibition, the Execu-
tive Commissioner finds all the newspapers in New'
Zealand have determined to make no reference whatever
to the individual exhibits in the courts. They will notice
the exhibits of firms and private individuals only by
means of paragraphs, which are to be paid for at the rate
of ss. an inch. If you desire to have any reference made
to your exhibit in the newspapers, you can either make
your own arrangements direct w'ith the newspapers
which you prefer, or if you would indicate your wishes
and pay the amount in advance, the officer in charge of
the New South Wales court will secure the necessary
advertisements. You can, of course, dictate the
phraseology. Henry C. L. Anderson,
Director N.S.W. Intelligence Dept.”
The reply w'as : “ I have no desire to advertise myself
in any way in connection with the N.Z. Exhibition. At
the same time it seems to me highly deplorable that the
authorities should lend themselves to such a monstrous
system of mercenary exploitation. I cannot for a
moment call it journalism, and I utterly fail to see how
the public at large can form a true conception of the
merits of the exhibits, with such a corrupt method of
journalism.”

“ Deeby ” : On what commercial principle does
the Government persist in renting (generally at a ridicu-
lously high figure) such necessary and permanently-
required premises as post-offices, police stations, court-
houses, etc.? At Tomingley (N.S.W.), for instance, the
various departments have for years been paying rent at a
figure that must represent the cost of the land and
wooden buildings over and over again. And this, too,
not in a mining town which might die any day, but in a
place that, being surrounded fey good wheat-growing
farms, is certain to be permanent.
P. H. O’Keefe, of Ramornie (N.S. W.), has in-
vented a new process for corning’ meat in 10 minutes,
which renders the use of a pickling plant unnecessary.
It is claimed that by the new process the “extract” of
the meat, which is destroyed in the ordinary pickling
process, is saved. Stated that the process has been
successfully tried at Ramornie.

“I wish,” said the butcher, “somebody would
manage to raise a kind of centipede breed of sheep or
pigs. I never saw such a demand as we have nowadays
for trotters and pigs’ feet. Some families are growing so
dainty that they ‘can’t eat anything but white meat.’
They’d faint at the sight of a good healthy sirloin.
There’s something else they 7 have more reason to faint at,
though, if they only knew it. Let them give a look in at
the slaughter-house some day and see the tubfuls of
their beloved trotters being scraped. Ugh, slime ! No,
it’s not that there’s any avoidable lack of cleanliness.
Just think of the state of any beast’s feet. The trotters
are about the dirtiest part anyone could pick on. Still,
the dainty dames will have them.”

“O.”: My bottle-merchant is, upon occasions,
rather communicative, and recently told me this :
“ ’Spose yer wunder w’y we calls all wimmen ‘ lvdy ’ ? It's
this w’y. ’Sposin’ yer strikes a middlin’ old ’un, a bloke
thinks she’s married and calls her ‘ missus.’ Sum uv ’em
gits real wild at it, and shoos yer orf the premises. Then,
agin, yer comes acrost a young and pritty bit o’skirt,
and a cove arsts ’er, ‘Enny old hiurn, Miss?’ and orl the
rest uv it, not ’avin’ no time to take stock uv the ring on
her finger. Well, ’er face goes all red, and she snaps —
‘ Me ’usband don’t drink,’ an’ bangs the door tremenjous.
That’s the reason we calls ’em ‘ lydy.’ A bloke ud do no
biz. else.”

The “mail order” swindler, whose tricks go a
long way towards spoiling the post-office business of
reputable firms, reaches his top note in the U.S.A. A
recent American book, Calkins and Holden’s “Modern
Advertising,” mentions some choice instances. A quack
sold salt and water at a dollar a bottle, as a sure remedy
for some disease or other, until the post-office people
found him out arid issued a fraud order stopping his mail.
Then he moved to a new location, taking with him the
letters he had received from his victims. He labelled his
bottles of salt and water with a new name, and wrote to
his dupes thus :—“ I have heard how you have been vic-
timised by Dr. So-and-So. Such swindles cannot be too
greatly deprecated. I know, however, that you are suffering
from what is supposed to be an incurable complaint. In
fact, the only thing I know of that will cure you is my
remedy, which I shall be glad to send you in return for a
dollar.” Thousands of those who were “had” before
sent in their money, and received the same old worthless
“remedy.” One mail-order fiend offered to send a com-
plete set of parlor furniture for 3£ dollars, saying that the
picture given was an exact likeness. This proved true,
even to the extent that the furniture was no larger
than in the picture —it was doll’s-house furniture.
Many a fool has sent 25 cents for “a complete
sewing machine ” and received a needle. Others have
sent 50 cents for “ a steel engraving of General Grant”
and received a postage-stamp. The U.S. law, which
is even more than the usual ass, says it can’t prove
that a needle is not a complete sewing machine. An
ingenious person lately 7 advertised sheet music—“ 100
titles for 10 cents.” In return for the money he sent 100
titles and nothing more. His customers paid for a
meagre catalogue when they had anticipated getting the
actual music. After all, most of those who are thus duped
deserve to fall in. The average swindler’s advertisement
is specially baited to catch the skinflint who wants
impossible value for his or her money, and it seldom fails.
Said the fisherman : “ Fish is a luxury for most
people, and it’ll never be otherwise till we have an all-
day7 market, where the fishermen can sell and the people
drop in and buy. The City Council should take the
matter in hand. It’s not what we make out of it that
makes the price so stiff. Look here. We’d had a great
cast off Coogee. The water was just thick with mullet,
and we started selling them four a bob. After getting
down to a bob a dozen, we had sold about £l2 worth
between us, and still had about a cartload left; so we
took ’em to the markets. Next day we got the return.
We owed %s. With the ss. cart-hire to pay, we’d have
been 7s; in pocket if we’d thrown the fish into the water.”
“Itan ” : The custom of putting up £1 with the
Australian gas cos. before they will condescend to lay on
their suffocating substance is worth looking into. How
many people annually quit a city or die and leave
this money uncollected ? Then, how many people
have ever attempted to collect the interest due?
It would not be much for a year, or five years, but I know
of a case where the interest has been accumulat-
ing for 25 years, and the old woman to whom
it is due did not know she had any claim for
the accumulations. The gas cos. which make the deposit
a hard-and-fast rule ought to be just as hard-and-fast
about seeing that their depositors, who are often
ignorant of their claims, are occasionally reminded —say
every five years—that there is interest due. The com-
panies couid simply reduce the bill by the amount of the
accrued interest.

A certain kind of city photographic firm nowa-
days sifts the city and country papers for announce-
ments of deaths. If any address is given at which
sorrowing relatives may possibly be found, it at once
despatches a bulky envelope containing (1) a sample
photographic memorial-card ; (2) an intimation that a
dozen such of deceased, with an enlargement thrown in,
will be sent for 12s. 6d. ; (3) twenty-nine selections Of
obituary doggerel of the “dearest Willie, thou has left
us” type, from which a choice can be made ; (4) an order
form ; (5) an addressed envelope ; and (6) a request that
in the event of no order being forwarded, the card will
be returned. The only thing forgotten is the stamp to
put on the returned card. The repression of this kind of
ghoul is badly needed.

“Araemo”: “ Albert D.’s” par. re small boys
coming from banks with large sums of money, awakened
in my mind ideas of wealth which had lain dormant since
Solution’s defeat in the Cup. Yesterday, seeing a small
boy with a neatly-tied parcel coming out of Fink’s Build-
ings, I made myself known to him as a brother of his
father’s rich uncle in Fiji. Then, after buying him a
4,000,000 microbe power ice-cream (price Id. —microbes
are cheap here), and presenting him with one of my
specially imported cigarettes (price £d.), I sent him to a
book store with 2s. to buy me a book, consider-
ately offering to mind his parcel for him during
his absence. ' During said * absence, Bill, whom
I had not seen for many years, came along and
invited me to “ Comeanavataste.” Quite forgetting
about my 2s. and the boy, I accepted—not that
I care for drinking, but you know how easily people
named Bill take offence. On reaching home I suddenly
noticed the heavy parcel in my hand, opened it; result,
2499 anli-Sosh circulars. Heavy? My oath! Full of
Greid’s arguments. Now, does The Bui.i.ktin’s family
lawyer consider that the law will help me to recover my
lost capital of 2s. ljd. from Albert D. ? If not, will you
at the very least send me Albert D.’s address ?

“N.L.” : In recent baby-food advertisements I
notice a fondness for the introduction of tags of verse.
For instance—
Deny me not my birthright:
I want to be a man.
That serves to introduce the statement that “ Rupert
Vyvyan Mudkins’s parents did not deny him his birth-
right of Fuffem’s Dropseena Food,” and the unfortunate
fatted Rupert is photographed in a nude state to show
how beautifully bloated one can become at an early age.
Still worse is the elegant extract printed with the photo
and full name of a child of school age—
The gracious boy who did adcirn
The.worjd whereipto he was born.
In addition to being fattened till his cheeks hang almost
to his collar-bone, the poor kid is thus made to believe
that the street lamps may take a rest when he walks out
with his halo. In fact, if he is thick-skinned enough to
survive the barracking of schoolfellows who see the
advertisement, he is almost sure to turn out a “ social
reformer ” of the highest Worrality.

It transpired at Melbourne City Court lately
that a city hawker had paid £350 in fines for breaches of
by-laws, and was still going strong. The Law has appa-

THE UNDERTAKER’S DREAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was the undertaker-man, the blithe Adolphus Tombs,
Who slumbered in the eerie night and dreamed of peoples’
dooms.
He saw a mighty Burial Trust arise to fix the dead ;
And he, Adolphus Tombs, was of that Burial Trust the
head.
He saw his mighty octopus reach out across the sea ; ■
It held the blessed title-deeds of every cemet’ree.
The dead of six great continents were handled by the ed-
it “ undertook ” the universe and pooled creation’s woe !
“ Let Standard Oil abase itself,” the dreaming buryer
sighed;
“ The Hearse Trust trades in Rockefellers—it treads the
path of pride 1
We deal in kings and emperors—we handle dukes and
czars ;
There’s every kind of human freight aboard our black-
plumed cars.
The pauper and the M.L.C. alike must come to us—
Yea, Carnegie himself will ride in our sepulchral ’bus !
We are the only autocrats who fear no earthly foe ;
For war and pestilence bring trade unto our coffin co 1 ”
The undertaker laughed aloud and revelled in his dream;
He saw mankind rush to the grave in one unending
stream!
He saw ten thousand hearses roll around the creaking
sphere,
And gladness bubbled in his soul each time he spied a
bier !
“All mine! All mine!” he cried, in mirth. “The
mourners earn the fee
Which they likewise must pay ere long in golden coins
to me !
I am the Ruler of the globe—all others are but trash ;
I bury all the universe—my terms are strictly cash !
What are their shoddy dynasties,” he said, “ compared
with me?
I am the greatest figure in the world’s pale history !
I buried Pharaohs by the Nile—l planted Caesars, too ;
I was an institution when the Aryans were new ;
And now at last I claim my own—l claim the right to rule
This graveyard from my coffin throne, and be its guiding
ghoul.
Adolphus Tombs, be firm!” he cried; “to thine own
self be just.
Go! raise the price of monuments —you are the Coffin
Trust ! ”

Summer Days.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GLAD Summer days are coming.
Dew-lipped the air and clear,
The cicada is humming,
’Mid crowned acacia near ;
Balm-winds have fanned an ember—
’Twas flame one dream-December —
Will you, dear heart, remember
When Summer days are here ?
Bright mating birds are questing,
With wholly-ravished ear ;
Sweet Summer birds are nesting.
They know the time o’ year !
And ’neath the gum-boughs shady
Roam dream-eyed lad and lady ;
O earth is half Arcady
When mating days are here I
Mad passion days are looming—
What heart can paint their peer ?
With clematis perfuming
The boscage and the mere ;
Forlorn the mouth that misses
Soft Summer’s wooing kisses,
But Love’s fete-time, I wis is,
When passion days are here.
Soft, dreamy days are limning
The things I most revere ;
Ah me, should eyes be dimming
Though joys be in arrear ?
Where are the love-new fancies
We wove round old romances?—
Life seems to court mischances
When dreaming days are here.
Soon wooing days are over,
Dream-days to memory dear,
When earth was sweet with clover
And Love was buccaneer,
And Queen of Summer gave her
Sweet mouth a sweeter savor,
For kissing goes by favor
When wooing days are here.
But wintry days shall darkle
With dreariness and tear ;
When eyes once wont to sparkle
Gaze on a poor career,
And dreams are fast decaying,
See you keep Love a-maying,
Nought else is worth the staying
When wintry days are here.
n.s.w.
W. M. WHITNEY.
Tim’s Mishap.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WAS awakened by something between
a bellow and a curse, followed by a loud
guffaw and a storm of abuse. Then the
silence resumed.
In the early-morning stillness of the Maoriland
bush there is a beauty that is indescribable, a rich
absence of sound that is more harmonious than
the most splendid melody ever made. Later on
in the day it becomes oppressive, and, if one is
alone, absolutely terrifying; but between four
and six_a.ni. it is altogether charming. All sleep
had left me, so I lit my pipe and, looking through
the half-open flap of the tent, thought regretfully
of the last girl I had kissed, some six months
before. She was only a tow-headed chamber-
maid in a small pub. at Wanganui, but she was
the last white girl I had seen, and at the distance
she seemed divine.
Then Turae, the Maori guide, gave his morning
halloo, and broke in on the golden silence with
the discordant clanging of two tin pannikins, and
I got out of bunk and climbed into a rough canvas
suit. As I walked outside I was joined by Tim,
carrying his towel and soap-box.
The sun was just peeping over a distant range
and flooding the gorge in which we were encamped
with light that seemed to bring no heat with it.
The river still lay in shadow. Down at the galley
the Maori wahine who cooked was pottering
about, ordering her husband, Turae, to bring some
water. But that noble deacon of the Anglican
Church was regarding the shadow-draped river
meditatively, while he sucked desperately at a
pipe that seemed to be full of anything but
tobacco.
“I’m sick of this flaming job,” said Tim, as
we strolled down to the river with our towels.
“ I’m just hungry for a sight of a white woman.
These infernal Maori wahines give me the
bloomin’ pip. I’d chuck it only I want to have a
decent cheque this Christmas. The old mother’s
gettin’ worn out, an’ if I stick to this job right
through I reckon I’ll have enough to set her up in
a bit of a humpy down Heretaunga way. It’d be
a great comfort to the poor old soul, and a good
home for me.”
“Well, judging by the risks you take to get the
job done quickly, you are rather anxious to leave
the poor old mother totally unprovided for. Why
don’t you exercise a little caution ? ”
“ I’m goin’ to ! I’m goin’ to be like you—take
all sorts of fine care of myself.”
Tim had the name of being the incarnation of
reckless courage, and I the embodiment of
cowardly self-preservation, and this unintentional
emphasising of it made me wince. Every man
likes to be thought a bit of a devil till he gets old
and philosophic enough to know better.
* * * *
After breakfast Tim, Harry and I started off to
plant a few iron pipes, and make a fixed point on
Mt. Desolation. The first three miles of the
journey were by canoe and upstream. The Boss
came as a passenger. Now, in all the world there
is no more beautiful trip than that up the Wan-
ganui River, provided you do it under the
auspices of the Maoriland Tourist Department,
reclining under the awning of a well-appointed
steamer. But a lot of the poetry was taken out
of the excursion that morning by the fact that we
had to pole an extra-crazy Maori canoe over some
vile rapids, and by the discovery, after we had
started, that Tim had neglected to part his hair
down the centre, so that the vessel was lop-sided.
Still, it was pleasant enough, and we landed at
the mouth of Paotamariki Creek comparatively
fresh. A broad arrow and Mt.D., blazed on a big
taua tree, indicated the track, and we loaded up
and plunged into the bush.
I was carrying the theodolite in its box on my
shoulders, and the legs of the instrument under
my arm. Everybody else carried iron pipes.
The boss seemed to have got suddenly impatient,
and the way he bustled us along caused the sweat
and language to flow freely. Tim was particu-
larly distressed—the huge, iron pipe to be used in
the making of the fixed point was travelling on
his shoulders, and it had the longest distance
to go.
Suddenly the track stopped right on the edge
of a precipice.
“ What sort of an adjective trap is this to lead
men to?” I snorted in disgust, just managing to
wriggle back in time.
“Oh, that’s nothing. Can’t you see an earth-
quake’s shook half the hill down into the gully
and left only the rock standing,” said the hoss,
commencing to climb down with the agility of a
baboon.
He'had both hands free, yet it seemed to take
him all he knew to negotiate it. Tim came up
and looked. Then he heaved the iron pipe over
the edge, and went after it with a whoop. Harry
went racing after the boss, who turned round and
asked me was I going to wait there till my
balloon was brought up.
Taking a firm grip of my heart between my
teeth, I started to scramble down. Suddenly I
slipped. I grabbed wildly at anything and
everything in vain. I sailed past the boss in a
sitting posture, and beat him by yards. The way
the perspiration poured out of me as I shot down
that waterway, expecting to have the backbone
ripped out of me every moment, was awful.
When I reached the bottom safely I sat on a big
boulder and smoked a cigarette to still the beating
of my heart.
The boss took about seven more minutes to
negotiate the last 20ft. or so, and when he had
arrived safely he came over to where I sat smok-
ing.
“By——, that was a narrow escape you had.
Why you might have ”
“Pooh 1” I said, interrupting him, “I always
come down those sort of places like that.”
The boss was too horrified to speak.
* * * *
The boss left us there, and Harry, Tim and I
went on to make the fixed point. The boss was
the most worldly-wise man I ever met; his know-
ledge of when it was the right time to leave every-
thing to the other fellows amounted to genius.
For two hours we struggled through a tangled
wilderness, where Walking was most difficult,
owing to the ground being covered with a net-
work of roots, on which the boots slipped. The
slightest touch brought the bark off the roots, and
there was no security of foothold, and life and
limb were further endangered by the way Tim
threw the big iron pipe about every time he fell.
Then the trees gave way to shrubs, and we came
out on to a naked spur of Mt. Desolation.
It was indeed a thunder-blasted outcrop, still
bearing evidence of its volcanic origin. The spur
we were travelling on was composed of paapa
rock, which is merely compressed pumice. It
was steep and slippery, and, like the straight and
narrow way, seemed to grow beautifully less as
we advanced. All sign of scrub had vanished,
but here and there a giant mountain birch still
forced its way through a cleft, or hung precari-
ously over the edge of frowning cliffs.
Suddenly the paapa rock gave way to black
basalt, smooth as glass, that rang like iron;
narrow and narrower grew the track, and we
came to a dead halt.
In front of us was a razorbaclc not more than
six inches wide. On the right it shore off, and
then dipped down sheer 300 ft. to where giant
masses of rock lay piled in heaps, that told as
plain as any words of a tremendous earthquake.
On the left it was swept by the top branches of a
giant mountain birch that had its roots in the
gully below. Harry and I stared at this horror
as though it were an overdue promissory note,
and each waited for the other to propose turning
back.
“ Gor’struth ! Watcher waitin’ for, you blokes ?
Go on ; flop across it,” grunted Tim, bringing the
iron pipe down with a bang that might have
brought the whole spur away with a run.
“Flop across it yourself,” I snorted, lying
down for him to step over me.
“Wait till T light me pipe an’ I’ll go across
that in one act,” said Tim, cheerfully, as he
rubbed the tobacco between his palms.
Harry looked round.
“ It’s the only way ! We’ll just have to straddle
it —you can always straddle basalt. It’s safe as
the bank.”
And he got down and straddled it, with a leg
on each side, levering himself across with his
hands. Harry is a small man, and his hands are
flat, and reminiscent of nothing else but huge fry-
ing-pans. As I watched him walk across that
razorback on them, I realised why they were so,
for when Harry went surveying first he carried a
bill-hook in his right hand and his feeding-bottle
in his left, and he had been travelling on his
hands ever since.
In three minutes he was across, and he turned
round and sang a brief snatch of Te Dewrn Lauda-
mws, into which he interpolated something about
a girl’s stockings. Then I got down to follow
him, pushing the legs of the theodolite in front
of me till Harry grabbed them, and I finished with
a great rush.
“Now then, Tim, shove that pipe in front of
you, side on, so that it’ll be resting against your
knees all the time, or it’ll get away from you, and
then you’ll darned well have to go after it.”
Tim scoffed, spat on his hands, swung the pipe
on to his shoulder, and stepped jauntily on to the
smooth basalt face. We clutched one another in
horror, as we realised that if Tim fell over the
precipice one of us would have to climb down and
fetch up that infernal pipe.
He was just half-way across when his right foot
slipped. The iron pipe flew off his shoulder,
struck the edge of the ridge, and leaped away
down the masses of rock 300 feet below. Tim bit
his cutty through in his agony, and the bowl
smashed on the basalt while he swallowed the
stem. It seemed to take him hours to fall on his
hands and turn over gracefully into the top
branches of the giant mountain birch, where he
disappeared.
Harry spoke first. I was too broken-hearted
thinking of the poor, worn-out old mother to say
anything just then.
“ Terrible, isn’t it ? Look here, old man, you
go and get that blasted pipe while I climb
down and try to get the corpse for burial. We
must bury it, you know—wild pigs !”
We both shuddered.
“ No, we’ll go together—it wouldn’t be fair to
leave you to do the grisly work all on your own,
old man,” I replied, sympathetically. I realised
that Tim could be buried at the bottom of the
cliff where he fell, while the pipe had to be
brought up again to the top of the mountain,
which wasn’t exactly the same thing.
Further discussion was cut short by a violent
outbreak of blasphemy from the recesses of the
mountain birch.
“ Come and get me down ! ” yelled Tim.
“ Where are you ? ”
“ In the flaming tree ! ”
“Areyou hurt?”
“No, but I can’t get down.”
“Well, may the devil take you for a clumsy
nuisance—no one told you to get into the tree,
anyhow.”
“ Well, come down and get me out.”
It was nearly two hours later when we arrived
at the butt of the tree, and, looking up, dis-
covered Tim perched far up on a big branch which
was separated by some 20 feet from the one next
to it, and with no staircase communicating be-
tween the two.
“How am I to get down?” wailed Tim, who
was getting seriously frightened.
We studied the problem from all points. As
Tim couldn’t get his arms round the trunk the only
way seemed to be for him to drop into the branches
below and trust to luck to be able to catch one of
them. We urged Tim to risk it, and when lie
merely appealed to the Virgin instead of doing
it we got tired and explained that if he was
afraid, he would have to stay there till we went
miles up the river and got ropes, if they were to be
got, and dropped them into the tree from the
ridge above, so that he could lower himself down.
The afternoon sun dipped behind the shoulder
of Mount Desolation, and the atmosphere took
on an evening tone. We below had boiled the
billy and had lunch, and Tim still hesitated, Wo
were just in the middle of a quiet smoke when
Tim exclaimed in a voice of great agony.
“All right, chaps; I’ll flop—stand by and try
to catch me if I come right through.”
He hesitated for another five minutes, and then
gingerly lowered himself down, swung by his
hands for a minute or so, and, with an awful yell,
dropped. He struck a great mass of foliage, shot
sideways towards the trunk, turned over, and
came headfirst through a great fork. There was
a loud, ripping sound, and then he stopped, and
swung by one leg. His canvas trousers were
caught on a short stump of a branch about as
thick as a man’s thumb. Tim clawed desperately
at the big branch, but could not get a grip of it.
We had previously cut half-a-dozen long rata
vines to try to get up to him, and in a moment
we had heaved the end of one over the branch,
let it run down and caught the other end of it.
Then we dragged it against Tim, and, as he
clutched it, Harry sho.uted :
“Unbutton your braces and fall out of your
pants, and climb down the rata.” He did it, and
in another 30 seconds was safe on the ground,
guzzling hot tea.
We had to let him rest for a bit, and then we
started back for the river. It was dusk when we
reached it, and grey banks of fog hung along its
shores, and the tops of the pyramidal hills looked
like islands rising above it. Above, the sky
turned purple blue ; one great star came out and
flamed with a greenish glitter, and then the moon
came climbing up over the eastern hills. A
mopoke called dismally, and from Maori wharcs
along the bank came the sound of hymns, and
occasional laughter. Dogs barked here and there,
and we drifted down, paddling lightly and
cautiously, keeping a sharp look-out for snags.
All was wistful peace.
Round the bend we saw the camp lights gleam-
ing with the welcome of home. The boss came
down to the bank, and said he was quite anxious
about us, and was darned glad to see us. Then
Tim shouted to the Maoris to send the wahines to
their tents, and climbed out of the long grass
with which he had covered his legs to keep the
mosquitos from them, and the boss’s wild
laughter woke up a hundred thousand echoes
around the hill and valley where slept the slain of
Moteo fight.
When we got to the cook-house and commenced
on the pigeon soup the boss asked for the field
book to look over the observations from the fixed
point. We told bim there was no fixed point,
and that the iron pipe was down a great shaft as
deep as Slieol, and Tim’s pants were hanging in a
mountain birch about 200 ft. in the a,ir. The boss
stopped laughing and commenced to curse, but we
took no notice; the pigeon soup was good.
Next morning we stole another iron pipe out of
stock, and made the fixed point without misad-
venture.
C. A. JEFFRIES.
In committee on the Merchant Shipping
Act Amendment Bill the House of Commons
lately rejected, by 248 to 105, a motion by Have-
lock Wilson to give Lascars outside the tropics
the same forecastle space as is allowed to white
seamen. Said the President of the Board of
Trade :
Such an amendment would impose on shipowners a
tremendous disability.
The tremendous disability that over-crowding im-
poses on our fellow subjects apparently doesn’t
count. Somehow it’s the man who talks of the
nigger as a brother, and who raves most fiercely
about shutting him out, that sees the least need
of giving him anything better than the dog-kennel
to live in. He’s only a brother until the brother-
business begins to cost something in hard cash.
Then the brother-business amounts to a “tre-
mendous disability.”


KIDNEY DISEASE MAKES you MISERABLE.
You Cannot be Cheerful if Your Kidneys are 111.
When you think of the great
work the kidneys have to do —how
for 24 hours every day they are fil-
tering the impurities and waste
from the blood—can you wonder
that they so readily break down,
and retain the liquid poisons that
cause backache, rheumatism,
gravel, urinary disorders, heart
trouble, nervousness, sleeplessness,
etc. ? Before you can be perman-
ently cured, these poisons must be
driven out, and the kidneys must
be made well again, so that they
can keep up with their work.
If you have any form of kidney
trouble—backache, rheumatism,
gravel, dizzy spells, urinary dis-
orders —if you are easily upset and
worried —if you never feel rested,
don’t enjoy your food, and can’t*
sleep —if your skin is yellow and
your eyes puffy —don’t hesitate
any longer, but begin at once with
the genuine Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, for every day that
kidney complaint is neglected it
becomes more dangerous.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
are sold by all Chemists and
Storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per box
(six boxes 15s. 3d.), or will be
posted on receipt of price by

MOTHER and CHILD CURED
or
BACKACHE, HEADACHE, DIZZI-
NESS, AND WEAK KIDNEYS,
12 MONTHS WELL.
Mrs. Louis Sraorti, 1 Little Selwyn-street, Moore
Park, this city, says :—“ I can give Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills a real good recommendation to all those
who suffer with weak kidneys. I have proved this
medicine in the case of my little boy, who had very
weak kidneys. Every night he lay in discomfort in a
wet bed, and the secretions were very discolored.
Indications showed that the kidneys were in a very
unhealthy condition. I heard of children having been
cured of this complaint by Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, but did not use them at first; I tried various
other remedies. After a good many failures, a friend
again strongly urged me to try Doan’s Pills. I
resolved that I would give them a trial, and am very
pleased to be able to tell you that they have wrought
a permanent cure. Two boxes were quite sufficient
in his case, and he has been quite well for over a year
now.
“I might also mention that Doan’s Pills proved
very good in my own case. I suffered with back-
aches, headaches, and giddiness. Some days I could
scarcely get about my work. I used four boxes,
and am quite cured —and cured permanently, for over
a year has passed, and I have had no return of the
ailment.”

The Slaying.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT five minutes to eleven the short,
stout man, who had stated that he in-
tended to slay the destroyer of his happi-
ness, took his eyes off his beer, pulled the Other
frantically by the sleeve, and whispered :
“ By George, I fergot ! I earn’ do it t’ night ! ”
The Other—he was tall and fierce, and not at
all sober—regarded him with a glazed eye.
“ Why earn’ yer do it ? ”
The short man grabbed his arm and peered im-
ploringly up at his face. “It’s no use! Icarn’
kill him—at least not t’ night ! ”
The Other shook him off and snorted, “W’y
earn’ y’ ? ”
“ Becos’ ” —the little man labored in the throes
of an explanation—“ becos’ I’ve gone an’ fergot
me blanky spectacles ! ”
The Other took the cigar out of his mouth and
shook off the ash before he spoke.
“ I didn’t know yer was goin’ t’ kill him with
yer blanky spectacles!”
There was a pause.
“ But—l’m not goin’t’ kill him with th’ blanky
spectacles ! ”
The barman gave them a withering glance as he
passed.
“ Well—what d’ye wan' ’em for ?”
“ Becos, y’ fool, I car’n see without ’em, can I ? ”
The Other considered awhile. Then he yawned
and said, “I dunno !”
“ But I tell yer I carn't I ”
“ Oh, I dunno !”
“But, dammit, I tell yer I carn’t!!” The
little man’s voice rose to a shriek, and the Other
looked down at him sternly.
“ Well,” he growled, “w’y don’ y’ shut up an’
finish y’ beer! ”
The little man obediently lifted his glass and
drank. Then he wiped the froth off his moustache,
and shook a fat clenched fist under the Other’s
nose.
“Shee that?” he asked.
The Other blinked wearily. “Yesh, I shee!”
“ Well, ole boy, that's how I’ll kill ’em !”
The big man patted him kindly on the shoulder.
“ Blanky rot,” he said—“ all blanky rot! ”
“No/”
“ Oh yesh, ’tis ! ”
“W’y is it?”
“ Becos y’ll miss y’ blanky train ! ”
“ Well, wot if I do miss th’ blanky train ?”
“An’,” said the big man, “an’ y’ won’ kill
’im ! ”
“ W’y not?”
“Becos—y’— couldn't! You don’ seem know
what y’ doin’ I ”
“W’y?”
“You said firs’ time you was—goin’ kill ’im
with—yer blanky speotaoles /”
Wild with rage, the little man shouted indig-
nantly, “ I didn't II ”
“ Well, wot did y’ say? ”
“ I said that I couldn’t kill ’im without ’em.”
“ Well, what does that mean ? ”
“Eh?”
“ What does it mean ? ”
' ‘ W’y it meant ”
“That you were goin’ kill ’im with ’em,
didn’t it?”
The little man choked and waved his arms.
“ Look ’ere ! I didn’t say I was goin’ to hit ’im
with th’ blanky things ! ”
The big man pointed to the counter. “ Well,”
he asked, “ w’y don’ y’ finish y’ dam beer ? ”
The little man drained his glass.
“ Pit kill’im!” he said when he had got his
breath. “ I’ll hit ’im on the jaw an’—an’ finish
’im ! ”
“ With y’ spectacles ? ”
The little man started, straightened up, and
poked him solemnly in the middle of the waistcoat.
“ ’Scuse me !” he said. “ ’Scuse me ! ”
The other blinked.
“Sert’nly, my fren’. Wot is it?”
“ D’ you min’ doin’ me favor ? ”
“Wot d’yer mean ! ”
“I don’ wan’ you t’ mention my spectacles
again this evenin’ ! ”
The big man thought it over.
“ Mos’ ’stordin’ry reques’ I ever heard!” he
said. Then, with growing anger, “Mos’
stordin’ry an’—an’ ungelmany ! ”
“ Well, you’ll ’blige me by not doin' it! ”
The big man made three attempts to light a
match. “Mos' insultin’!” he said, and threw
down the match unlighted.
The little man pushed his hat back, and started
to review the situation.
“Look ’ere,” he explained. “I asked you
come hero this evenin’ ”-
“Mos’ insultin’,” said the other.
“Asked you this evenin’ —come see me kill
’nother ”
‘ ‘ Mos ’ ’suitin’ ! ”
The little man lost his temper. “Oh-h,
shurrup !” he yelled. “Goon ! Shurrup I”
The barman tapped the big man on the shoulder
and whispered something.
“ Sorright! ” growled tho big man. “ Sorright
—frenner mine—sorright! ”
The barman retreated.
The little man beckoned him back, and pushed
over the two empty glasses.
“Twomeesium beers,” he said, and attempted
to light his pipe.
The barman returned the glasses filled, and
there was another pause.
Then the little man pushed a glass to his friend
and started again.
“ I’m’stremely sorry, ole chap, if I’ve ’fended
you —’ stremely sorry ! ”
The tall man blew a cloud of smoke.
“Don’ ’pologise,” he remarked. “ I’m blanky
sorry I came ! ”
The little man put down his glass with a firm
hand.
“ ’Sense me, but what d’ you mean I
“I mean I c’nsider whole dam thing ’stremely
stupid. If I’d had slightest idea you were goin’
t’ go on like this, I wouldn’t have come, I ’sure
you ! ”
“You’re ’stremely ’fensive, my fren’! ”
“Not’t all !”
“ Oh, yesh y’are !”
“Not’t all! ”
“ Oh, yesh y’are ! I asked you shivil question
an’ you ’mediately take ’fence.”
Then said the big man, as if to clinch the argu-
ment : “Well, w’y th’ devil don’ y’ finish y
beer?”
“ Thatsh not point’t all. You said ”
“ Finish y’ beer. Go on ! ”
“ I wan’ you ’stinctly un’stan’ ”
“ Finish yer” . >
“ When I ask you come an’ see me kill nother
man ”
“ Finish y’ beerl ”
“ ’Scuse jne, my fren’ ”
‘‘ Shurrup I”
The little man gasped and raised his hand.
“ ’Scuse me,” he said ; “ ’scuse me! ”
“ Shurrup ! ”
“ Oh, shurrup y’self !”
“ I won’ shurrup ! ”
There was a pause.
“ Well, who th’ divil is goin’ to shurrup? ”
There was another pause.
Then the barman leant over the counter.
“ Gentlemen, it’s closing time. I’m going to
shut up! ”
KODAK.
A Man and Two Women.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DON’T speak to me about the refining
influence of woman.
That influence is merely a dam—no,
this is not swearing—a dam behind which a man’s
vices grow big. Sometimes that dam gets worn-
out and leaks. Sometimes it collapses with one
tremendous bust, as it did in Swan’s case. Poor
old Swan ; his was a collapse.
He was my cabin-mate on the Bacchus —Bob
Swan, a good engineer, but his taste for whisky
had been born many generations before him, and
consequently was boss.
The Refining Influence came aboard at Mar-
seilles. Her name was Miss Marshall, and she
was travelling with her aunt. She was leaning
over the after-railing, watching the last little
red-tiled roof lose itself among those great grey
rocks, when Swan first saw her. Wearing the
uniform, which is a recognised substitute for an
introduction, Swan took tho first opportunity to
salute. The girl smiled, and he saw that she
was good. Then Swan leaned against the rail,
and said something appropriate to the grandeur of
the scenery.
That was how the reformation of Swan com-
menced.
I needn’t say much about the journey out —the
walks and talks on deck, the visits to the boat
deck to see the sunsets, the rickshaw ride to the
Cinnamon Gardens at Colombo. The story of all
these belongs to them alone ; though you should
have seen them with their deck chairs close
together, reading out of the one book, and—but
that, as Mr. Kipling doesn’t say, is the same old
story.
All this time the influence was at work. Swan’s
whisky consumption had dwindled away, and was
dead—drowned in lemon squash.
Dr. Marshall was down to meet his people, and
proposed a theatre party for the Tuesday night.
Swan was to go out to their Mosman’s Bay home
and dine with them before the show.
That Tuesday was a nasty day. Clouds of hot
dust swept along the streets. Swan, with a
beautiful little pearl ring stowed away in his
waistcoat pocket, was hanging about the town.
He had another hour before he need go back and
dress for the great event.
“May as well call in and see old Lil,” he de-
cided. “ Too bad to ignore her altogether. Must
get out of this infernal dust anyhow.” And thus
excusing himself, he turned down a side passage,
and entered a small back bar.
The room was cool and quiet, and soft light
filtered through red curtains. The other Refining
Influence was lounging on a sofa. She threw
down her novelette and ran to meet him, and
gurgled over him.
“Oh Bob! yon wretch, you’ve been in three
days and only come to see me now. Never mind.
Sit down, you great big thing, and I’ll bring you
a drink.”
“Truth is, Lil, I’ve given up drinking. Fact!
I haven’t had a drop of strong drink for a month.
Still, I suppose I must have something ” (she was
sitting on the arm of his chair by this time). “ Say
a hock and —no, damn it all, I’ll have a wee drop
of whisky and soda. I’ll be better with something
to-day.”
The girl went behind the bar and ran her hand
along the shelf.
“Turned good, has he? All right, I know
Bob,” she said to herself in the glass. Then
aloud—
“ I’ll pour them out, Bob,” and she carried
around the drinks. Swan didn’t like the whisky.
The girl said that it was the soda, ar.d they had
another with ginger-ale.
I don’t know what was wrong with that whisky,
but within half-an-hour Swan began to talk.
He told the girl that she was the only one he
ever thought about; that it was her face he saw
framed in tho Southern Cross as he came down
the Red Sea ; that it was her voice he heard over
the stern when the screws were softly singing in
the sea. He became poetical—wondrous are the
works of whisky.
Lil called him a “dear old kid,” and fixed his
hair. Then he bought champagne.
I was never able to track Swan from the time
he left that bar until 11 o’clock, when he arrived
at Circular Quay.
He was a beautiful picture of the busted dam.
A small flag was stuck in the top of his straw hat.
He had a nine-inch sunflower in his coat, and he
was carrying some article of feminine attire,
which he was quite unable to account for. Also,
he was waving half a lobster.
This apparition was bargaining with the man
in the change box for a fare to “ Mozh, Mozh’s
Bay ” in exchange for his watch and a cigar, when
the Marshalls arrived on their way home.
The doctor saw him, and, after hurrying his
wife and niece away, returned to put him in a cab.
Swan was delighted to see the doctor, and
hung all over him.
“You come alongsh me,” he said. “I wanna
talk ’bout Sadie. See, I gorra ring—no, give it
to ol’ Lil. Good ol’ girl, Lil. Know Lil ?
Never mind, come ’n’ have dozen bottled stout an’
’n oyster.”
The doctor didn’t hit him—just put him in a
cab, and wrote him a letter next day.
Swan got the sack for being more or less drunk
all the run home.
By this time I suppose he is damned in another
way with a damn that will last; but that, like
Mahommed’s coffin, is neither here nor there.

This is the strong and convincing testimonial of a
lady residing at Dalmain, N. S. W., whose portrait

‘ ‘ Some time ago I was taken
very ill, losing-' my appetite,
could not sleep, and was unable
to do my work. I was attended
by two doctors, but to no effect.
I became very thin and weak.
Sometimes when I was out I
would become so ill I would have
to go into»a neighbor’s house
until I was fit to walk again. I,
cannot describe my sufferings,
only to say that this state of
