THE Greatest Digestive Cure known is
Langebek's Pepsin Extract. The
British Medical Journal says: “It possesses
a much higher digesting power than the ordinary
form of Pepsin.”— Vienna Medical Press : “No
other Pepsin is of such superior quality, combin-
ing with its brilliant effects such moderation in
price.”— Berlin Pharmaceutical Journal :
“ Langebek’s Pepsin would have about six times
the effect of the official quality, or would be worth
600 per cent, of it.” —Numerous signed testimonials
from leading doctors are enclosed with each bottle.

The English
PROPHETS have generally been as
plentiful in England as they were
in Israel. They have not been
lacking in outspokenness, as they stood
in less danger of being stoned, for the
English rather like people who give it to
them hot, and the condemned public
always consists of the other fellows.
Some of the prophets have drawn atten-
tion to the analogy, as old as the Greeks,
between the life of a nation and the life
of an animal, and have ventured to sug-
gest that England may have her seven
ages like man ; that even England may
come to a time of decay and death.
“ Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage-
what are they ? ” Childe Harold asked
the ocean ; and is the noble and puissant
nation which Milton thought he saw as
an eagle renewing her mighty youth,
to be exempt from their fate? Time
has the answer to that question up
his sleeve ; but it does not need
any expert diagnosis to discover that
England is not very well inside just
now. She talks more about her condi-
tion than any other nation, and many
home and foreign physicians have ex-
amined her huge anatomy, reported on
her ailments, bullied her or flattered her,
prescribed their nostrums, or told her to
let things alone.
The Englishman has not been inclined
to admit ‘that there is anything more
serious the matter than a temporary in-
digestion, or perhaps a muscular strain
due to staggering so long under the load
of “ the too vast orb of her fate. ” Lately,
however, there has been reflected in her
literature a feeling of deeper concern
about, the condition of England and a
lessened confidence in her early recovery.
Wells and the minor prophets, Gals-
worthy and other novelists, numerous
social pathologists reporting upon local
diseases, Blue Books and newspapers,
reveal the fact that England is in a bad
way.
\t>
-One of the latest bulletins is that of
C. F. G. Masterman, who attempts a
general survey in The Ooudition of ling-
land (Dymock’s Library). It is brief and
admittedly hasty, yet in its able sum-
mary of many detailed works of special-
ists, and in its sincere and dispassionate
statement of things as they are to-day
in England, it is the best book of the
kind we have met. A preliminary ex-
cursus on the Spirit of the People proves
to be a cul-de-sac—it is practically impos-
sible to say “where the essential nation
resides, what spirit and temper in
what particular class or locality would
stand to the future for twentieth-century
England. ” Certainly not the fast-
diminishing remnant of aristocracy, nor
the new plutocracy. The middle class
has represented England in most ana-
lyses ; but below it is a huge, unexplored
mass of workers now beginning to be artic-
ulate. He therefore goes back and
examines the classes separately. On top
there are the Conquerors, then the Sub-
urbans, the Multitude, Prisoners (in the
factories), and the Country Side. 1
By far the largest part of an enormous
accumulation of wealth is in the hands of
the few on top, and they spend it without
serving any valuable purpose. “ Waste ”
is written large over a substantial propor-
tion of the expenditure, private and
national, and waste, it will be remem-
bered, was the great outstanding feature
of modern English ljfe which Wells ex-
hibited in Tono-Bungay. Much of the
increase in this wasteful spending is due
to an increase in the' pace, a “ speeding-
up” of living. The upper class scatters
the vast super-wealth of England in
ostentatious show and frivolous methods
of killing time ; little or none of it is
devoted to national service, the develop-
ment of art or encouragement of science.
They compete for pictures of great
masters, but leave the men of genius of
their own day to starve. The lives of many
of them are wholly occupied in fighting
boredom and dodging disease. And
these people contribute nothing to the
common stock of the nation—except
criticism of other men’s work.
The actual rulers of Empire, the men of
science, the great soldiers, the great artists
and writers, very rarely appear as the
children of or are rewarded by the qualifica-
tions for entrance into the governing
classes. ...
W
“ The Island Pharisees,” Galsworthy
called them; “The Conquerors” they
have been named by a foreign critic to
whom their serene confidence in the
justice of their position is both enviable
and exasperating. Strength, energy and
a certain crudity they have; but little
power of introspection, no irony and no
humor. It would not do for them to
have humor, for they might come to laugh
at themselves, and then their class would
fall to pieces. Devoutly thankful that
they are not as other people, and satisfied
that other people envy them, there is
little outside themselves to disturb them
on the way. The foreigner they treat with
indifference; the poor with contempt.
The one'thing they fear is Socialism :
Socialism which they do not understand,
but which presents itself as an uprising of
the uneducated, suddenly breaking into
houses ; their clumsy feet on the mantel-
piece, their clumsy hands seizing and de-
stroying all beautiful and pleasant things.
So they lie awake at night, listening fearfully
to the tramp of the rising host; the revolt of
the slave against his master A variable
and random philanthropy is the substitute
for Social "Reform. A buying-off of the more
energetic from below by honors and titles
liberally bestowed, prevents the attack upon
a whole class by the resentment of energy
and intellect excluded from privilege. Free
patronage and a liberal entertainment of
authors, critics, play-wrights, musicians, and
ambitious politicians removes the menace of
an intellectual proletariat exciting anger and
envy amongst the dim millions of the indus-
trial populace.
\l/
So much for the Conquerors, insolent
in their illusive security ; “ in danger of
being stricken with blindness to the
signs of the times.” The best of
the middle-class are the Suburbans.
Most of them work in offices or shops, and
live clean respectable lives. The aggres-
sion of the working-class frightens them
as much as it does the plutocrats whom
they imitate, and with whom they
identify themselves. The increasing
burden of taxation rouses them to fury,
but no one fears the Suburbans. They
act only when their grievances have be-
come unbearable, and are poor material
for the recruiting Socialist. Living on
the edge or beyond their incomes in the
effort to keep up appearances, they meet
the increasing cost of living by deferring
marriage or reducing the number of the
family. They are barren of ideals ; their
views are narrow, and vision limited ;
and their recreation is in watching pro-
fessional players, in guessing competi-
tions, limericks, and the music hall.
No one can seriously diagnose the condi-
tions of the “Suburbans” to-day without
seriously considering also the influences of
their chosen literature. There is nothing
obscene about it, and little that is morally
reprehensible. But it is mean and tawdry
and debased, representing a tawdry and
dusty world. You can see it in illustration.
Photographs of the - Englishman's Home,
showing the products of spectacular sport
and silly gambling, falling amid their falling
houses face the picture of a negro on a
raised platform pummelling an American,
with tier upon tier of white, vacant faces •-
the Australian spectators—gazing with fierce
approval.
There is, however, a leaven of educated
people who have developed beyond the
selfishness and narrowness of "the type,
and are building up a standard of their'
own. From these should come the leaders
of the Multitude; if the Multitude were
not showing signs of ability to produce
leaders of its own.
This mighty host, forming 80 per cent,
of the population, always on the border-
land of poverty, toiling so that others
may have ease and luxury, presents the
most alarming problem to anyone inter-
ested in the condition of England. What
are they going to do next? At present,
the only clear and certain demand from
them is that they should be left alone.
Masterman found the multitude too vast
and amorphous to furnish a distinctive
character or any definite conclusions, and
he therefore quotes the results of sectional
investigations, such as that of Stephen
Reynolds, who lived amongst the Devon
fishermen, and loved them for their sin-
cerity and courage ; Lady Bell, who
viewed the black and hopeless lot of the
iron-workers, their short lives of intoler-
able toil and the frightful mortality of
the children; Canon Barrett, who came
to the conclusion that the working class
is the hope of the nation ; and others.
He also studies a typical member of the
crowd—Will Crooks, a kind of East End
superman, in whom the multitude has
become articulate;.
In dealing with the class labelled
“Prisoners,” he gathers some valuable
material from Parliamentary Reports, and
states the position of the white slaves in
factories and shops much as it appears in
Kipps. “ We’re in a blessed drain-pipe,”
says Mr. Minton to Kipps* “ and we’ve
got to crawl along it till we die.”
Rural England is shown, undergoing
reconstruction, with its beauty dimmed
by the dust of countless motor-cars,
and the peasantry gradually fading
away :
At length appears the end; a rather
squalid and mournful end—to a life which had
once stood for the bedrock of England. The
peasant’s resources, the peasant’s vigor and
resistance, the peasant’s slow-moving, de-
liberate mind, had borne the burden of war
and change. From his villages came the old
folk-songs of the nation ; he built the village
churches, which are the treasures of rural
England, and once took a pride in them.
His secret wisdom, his fragments of half-
heathen half-Christian philosophy, his stand-
ards of bitterness and enjoyment, once made
up the temper aqd mettle of the common
people of England.
He is disappearing into the towns, and
the countryside is given over to the Con-
querors and their lackeys.
Masterman then sums up the pros-
pects of progress in relation to Science,
Literature, and Religion, and sees little
that is comforting on the horizon. He does
not suggest remedies ; he merely reports
the result of observations. His book is
written in a calm and judicial spirit, and
ought to go some way towards awakening
the English to the corrosion of gross
materialism which is eating to the heart
of England. The weary Titan still, as in
Matthew Arnold’s arraingment;
Stupidly travels her round
Of mechanic business, and lets
Slowly die out of her life
Glory, and genius, and joy.
- —_—
Another view of the English is given by
Price Collier, an American who has lived
for many years in England. He records his
impressions of the social characteristics of
the people in England and the English (per
Sydney Book Club) —which recalls Bulwer
Lytton’s shoddy work with the same title.
Collier regards England as pre-eminently a
man’s country. The men rule in the council
and the home, they are better dressed than
the women, their code of ethics obtains, not
the women’s, and altogether they have a
much better time. The men are heavy,
* stolid, self-satisfied and domineering ; law-
abiding—so long as they make their own
laws, not quarrelsome nor over-sensitive, and
their endurance is magnificent. Being
strongly Anti-Sosh, he admires the English
method of Government, and thinks the
machinery of State and Church, though
“illogical, absurd, monstrous even, in ap-
pearance, somehow works satisfactorily.”
England would be staggered, he says, if
she really knew how she looks in the eyes of
other people ; she is feared, but she has no
friends. The conceit of the English is mas-
sive ; their hypocrisy sublime. “ The t.emple
of the world has echoed and re-echoed for
many years now with the Pharisee’s prayer,
and the accent is unmistakably cockney.”
The Americans regard England as their play-
ground and the English as an inexhaustible
Source of amusement. “Are the English
dull ? ” he asks, and answers that they are ;
but in their dulness' lies their safety and
their success. Amongst other things this
dull race has produced the greatest litera-
ture since the days of Greece. “I believe
that the secret lies here : their great men
have had things to say instead of trying to
write things. We, in America, have had no
time, no energy to spare for literature.”
Collier offers the glad right hand of appre-
ciation to the English ; but he has a dirty
left of denunciation. He is a rank Tory,
however, and his hatred of the mob in his
own country makes him look favorably on
many things in England where the mob is
so well kept under ; but “nowhere is there
such squalor, such pinching poverty, so many
undersized, so many plainly and revoltingly
diseased, so much human rottenness ” as in
England. He does not attempt to probe
beneath the surface, and his book is only
useful as a partial corrective of the Liberal
bias in Masterman’s account.
O. Henry
O. Henry has delighted Australian as well
as American reader’s, but few of either have
come across biographical data about the man
behind the book. The bare fact that Sidney
Porter shrunk from the interviewer was
well known. At last, however, lie has been
cornered, and confesses to having been
tramp, prospector, sheep herder, book agent,
cowboy, tintype man, drug clerk and hack
journalist. All of them are in his pages.
He was born at Greensboro, North Carolina,
in 1867. As a young man he went to Texas,
where he' stayed three years. He purchased
that unusual paper, Brand's Iconoclast ,
which achieved brief but unfortunate
distinction, Brann being killed in a duel.
Porter was induced to go to Central
America in the. fruit business. It held
little profit, but good fictional fruit; and
the consuls and refugees, among whom the
writer moved later, lent actuality to the
atmosphere of Cabbages and Kings. Back
again to Texas, in a drug store ; then in New
Orleans, where he hit on, his pen-name;
selecting it, with a friend’s assistance, at
random from a social column. The initial was
chosen because it is the “easiest to make.”
Since then the author' has had to invent
meanings for the At length a New
York magazine offered to take 12 of his
stories annually at lOOdols. each. He now
gets 750d015. for stories lie would have been
glad to sell at 75 in former days. “A
few years ago,” he says, “I was selling
stories to a certain magazine at five cents a
word. I thought it worth risking to ask ten
cents. ‘ All right,’ said- the editor, ‘ I’ll pay
it.’ He was just waiting to be asked.”
“People say I know New York well.
Just change Twenty-third-street in one of
my New York stories to Main-street, rub
out the Flatiron Building, and put in the
Town Hall. Then the story will fit just as
truly elsewhere. At least, I hope this is the
case with what I write. So 10ng.,, as-your
story is true to life, the mere change of local
color will set it in east, west, south or north.
The characters in The A rabian Nights parade
up and down Broadway at mid-day or Main-
street in Dallas, Texas.”
Which reveals the true votary of Romance.
Roads of Destiny, O. Henry’s latest collec-
tion, is up to the level of his best work. A
number of the stories resemble those in
Cabbages (And Kings ; but the first in the
book belongs to a different family. It has a
touch of fantasy unusual in O. Henry, and
is something like the early R. W. Chambers’
stories of The King in Yellow-— of which a
new edition lias just been published by
Constable.
w
The First Edition of Prose and Poems , by
George Birney, 658 George-street, Sydney, should
be secured by collectors, as it may be very valu-
able in the time to come when Birney’s prophe-
cies of universal federation, etc., shall have been
fulfilled. Joe Smith, Elijah Duwie, and Mrs. Eddy
were very minor prophets compared vyitli Birney,
who speaks occasionally as the First Cause, and
issues proclamations to all thepeopleof the earth.
He commands Australians to bring from every port
of Europe within the next three years two millions
of the: poorest people. “I, promise that no ship,
carrying free people to this continent, shall
be destroyed by storm or tempest or tire
that I may cause to rage in the high
seas.” Captain Cook is to be worshipped,
and each Australian is to pluck one blade of grass
from his Landing Place and wear it next to
his heart on Cook’s birthday. And “when you
have all the commandments as above given ful-
filled, I shall ring out the dinner Bells of Heaven
and scatter broadcast the living seeds of man in
wh.eh all who take part in the fulfilment of my
command shall live for ever.” . . . If you don’t like
the prose there are the poems. Birney stands no
nonsense about rules of rhyme and metre : he
makes his own as he goes along. On the cover
he anticipates your query—“ Who is Birney?”
“ He is theshell of the world, who has come forth,
into light to tell you the people you’ll have to
unite. Further information next edition.”

HOW HEALTH WAS RESTORED.
“ When I first made the acquaintance of
Clements Tonic, some twelve years since, I was
living in Croydon,” said Mrs. Edith Browne, of 63
Mount Vernon Street, Forest Lodge, “and my
memory is so clear concerning the details of my
illness that it seems only yesterday that I threw
all my infirmities away.”
“If you don’t mind, I’d like you to give me an
outline of your sufferings,” remarked the writer.
“ How long were you ailing?”
“ Quite eighteen months, and during that time
I was treated by several doctors, besides being an
indoor patient of a hospital for six weeks, from
which institution I returned home as bad as ever,
and it really seemed to me that I was never going
to get well again. For a mother with a young
family to be in such a plight as I was in is enough
to break one’s heart to contemplate, and my prin-
cipal reason for giving my experiences for public
circulation is that I hope to assist other women in
throwing off their ailments, as I did. My nerves
were in a shockingly bad state —fairly jangling
together.”
“Did the doctors say what was wrong with
you, Mrs. Browne?”
“ They said I was dyspeptic, and greatly debili-
tated, and well I know it. I might say I was
so fearsome that even my own shadow frightened
me. Oh ! it was a wretched condition to be in,
with nothing but worry and trouble, and suffering
for my daily companions. But I believe nervous-
ness to have been the most awful bane of my life.
You’ve no idea how I was. The imaginations
that filled my brain were simply hideous. They
actually made me shudder. If I slept at all, which
was very seldom, I would wake up from dreams
that were ugly in the extreme —always fraught
with circumstances and happenings of a dreadful
nature, and I’d find myself shaking from head to
foot. I’d be afraid of falling asleep again, because
those dreams were too terrible to bear repetition.
During both day and night I always had an idea
that somebody was standing at the back of me,
with some evil object, of course ; and to tell you
the truth, my life was unbearable. For six
months I could take only the lightest of food, and
very little of that, so you may conjecture that I
diminished in weight a good deal.”
“Do you require to exercise discretion over
your food now ? ”
“No, indeed ; not since Clements Tonic cured
me years ago, have I had to bother about what I
ate, or what I left alone, for it made my digestion
so sound that it doesn’t matter what I take, as I
can digest all foods readily, and that means every-
thing to a person’s health. If you can eat well, and
digest your food, there is nothing wrong. That is
my experience, at any rate, and so long as I can
do that I shall continue to be the healthy and
contented woman that Clements Tonic has made
me. Up to the time of starting with that remedy,
I suffered from sharp pains, which ran from my
chest right through to my back. I was never
without them ; also headaches and giddiness, and
I don’t suppose a woman ever lived who was more
fretful than I used to be. Often, without any
cause, I would go and shut myself in my room, and
cry for hours. And I was given to fainting bouts
as well. All of a sudden a quivering sensation
would pass through me, and off I’d go. Oh ! often
I wished myself dead, and away from my afflic-
tions ; but now, thank God, I want to live as long
ss I can, to enjoy the many charms in this world
that are visible only to those in good health. My
gratitude to Clements Tonic for raising me up
when nothing else could, will last as long as there
is breath in my body, and so till then shall I
always advise other sufferers to use the same
remedy, for I am firmly convinced there is no-
thing to approach Clements Tonic for curing the
ills I have mentioned. To me it was perfection.
It drove away those headaches, it completely
abolished the pains from the various parts of my
body, the fits of giddiness and faintness have died
years ago, my nights became restful, and—yes,
happiest achievement of all. my nervousness was
entirely banished. So publish these facts in any
way you prefer.”

Winifred Cecilia Swatts
(9 months) suffered greatly while
teething last year, so her mother gave
her SCOTT’S Emulsion. “ After
taking the first bottle
of SCOTT’S ,” writes Mrs. Ber-
nard Swatts, 24 Bridge Street, Port
Melbourne, Victoria (August, 1908),
“ she had greatly im-
proved, and she is now
cutting her teeth with-
out any trouble, and is
gaining in strength and
putting on flesh rapidly.
She looks the picture
of health, and I have
no difficulty in getting
her to take SCOTT’S.”
The SCOTT’S Emulsion post-bag
last year brought this letter among
many hundreds, all containing new
records of cures by SCOTT’S Emul-
sion, cures that other preparations, and
all other emulsions, failed to secure
Of all chemists and dealers in medicines.

Bedroom Beer.
When the moon shines clearly, and all the stars
And cats go wailing about the world,
When out from the portals of lighted bars
The last lone Drunk is to darkness hurled,
A shape goes stealing in sombre habit,
Hugging a jug as a jewel dear :
The nightly boarder running the rabbit
Down the alley, for Bedroom Beer.
For the boarders creep, with a stealthy rush,
To the backstairs den with the faded rug :
The coins are tossed in a solemn hush,
And the loser seizes the bedroom jug,
bhoves the “ trays” in his trousers pockets,
Ducks to the lane when the coast is clear—
While the boarders watch him with straining
sockets
Waiting the solace of Bedroom Beer.
Bedroom Beer! Not a sweeter liquor
Ever was poured down a bedroom throat,
Whether you swill your mugful quick, or
Eke it out in a luscious gloat !
However you loathe your hash-tower poky,
You feel that, spite of the cynic’s jeer,
No feast can equal a sardine smoky
Washed with a jugful of Bedroom Beer.
For though, perhaps we may sail the seas
io a land remote where the Beers don’t grow ;
Or, gathering coins, may arrive at Ease
m a millionaire home, where it’s comma il faut
To swallow Burgundies, Hocks and Fizzes,
Yet in our hearts will old Memory sneer—
With a sigh for the Past—“ O, jigger it, this is
Nary a patch upon BEDROOM BEER ' ”

AUGUSTUS BLOWFLY.
The Turn of the Tide.
That tide in the affairs of men
Which, flowing once for each one, then
Leaves him who missed its surging flood
For ever stranded in the mud’,
Has worked much mischief since the day
The Avon Singer’s cocksure say
Imposed on Anglo-Saxon folk
Its sometimes inelastic yoke.
For this is what occurs to me—
However bold it seems to be
To doubt if we are always led
In wisdom by what Shakspeare said—
That surely he is very weak
Who, having lost one risk, can’t seek
Some other, for he needs must know
That chances come, if chances go.
Shall he who circumstances floor
Rise up against them nevermore?
Should one false start for ever keep
The steeplechaser from a leap ?
Through one vain try to catch his train
Ought Mr. Suburbs to remain,
Lost to the city’s busy scene,
A disappointed might-have-been ?
The man with a well-balanced mind
Is not thus tamely left behind.
He sees the “ maybes ” still ahead,
Knows “might-have-been” is always dead.
Though often intimate with Care,
He takes no counsel from Despair;
While life exists, Hope bourgeons too,
When blossoms fall, it buds anew.
The Ocean’s tides run out, but they
Return again, through night and day :
And, so in the affairs of men,
The flood that ebbs shall flow again.
Be of good heart, ye ooze-bound, think !
You struggle by the water’s brink.
Wade through, splash on ; you yet shall be
Strong swimmers in a swelling sea.

Bringing joy to a man as the wine did of yore—
The dance full of passion, the homeward walk
after—
Give me just these, and I'll ask for no more !
Always the grind and the battle and labor,
Always the conflict of sounds in the street ;
Always the night that has lost its sweet “savor—
Dust-blind and jaded and stifled with heat.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tiik Bulletin would, oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by talcing some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for "copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

THE FIRST FEDERAL LOAN, AND
THE BANKRUPTCY AND DISGRACE
THEREOF.
The Deakin-Cook Fused Government has issued,
by the mouth of Bigjohn Forrest, its first, and
doubtless its last, financial statement. The docu-
ment is a monument of incapacity and imbecility,
and probably the worst thing of its kind that Aus-
tralia has yet seen. And that is saying a great
deal, for Australia has had some weird and won-
derful Treasurers— William McMillan, Duncan
Gillies, Oollard Smith of the huge feet and the
absurd reputation, Robert Puilp, Waddell,
Wade and others—and they have built fearful
and amazing inventions. But despite all these
remarkable financiers and their doings in the old
dead days, the Deakin-Cook arrangement is a
record. Its main features are these six : (1) The
Fused Government doesn’t know where to find the
money required for the taking over of the Northern
Territory or the building of the two transcon-
tinental railways, so it leaves these matters out.
(2) Alfred Deakin has no clear idea how to find
the funds for the great defence scheme about which
he orated so magnificently during his recent
visit to England, so that is mostly left out. (3)
The Deakin-Cook combination hasn’t the least
idea how to find the cash for the building of its
Yassberra capital, so it has provided £5OOO (just
five thousand pounds) to go on with. (4) The
Fusion hasn’t the faintest glimmer of knowledge
how to finance its silly Dreadnought (though
it says that the thing has been “thankfully
accepted”) so it doesn’t provide one penny
towards the cost of it. (5) It shirks, as far as
possible, the question of the reorganisation of the
starved and depleted post and telegraph service.
(6) It finishes up, after exhausting £650,000 of
its predecessors’ accumulations, with a pro-
spective deficit of £1,200,000 for the year, which
it proposes to fill, in a temporary sort of way, by
borrowing the money. Hitherto the Australian
Government lias kept clear of loans ; but if bor-
rowing should commence it would at least be
decent to borrow exclusively for reproductive
works, and to attach a sinking fund for the early
repayment of the loans. To borrow £1,200,000
without any sinking fund, merely in order to fill
the gap in the revenue caused by one year’s in-
capacity, is the limit. Australia never struck
anything quite so unspeakable before.
* * * *
It is a common saying that curses, like chickens,
come home to roost, but this curse was evidently
more of an ostrich than an ordi ary hen, so
rapidly did it hurry up the home s(- ;tcli to its old
quarters. The simple fact is that the Fusion
bought its billet at too high •. price. It was
probably mad at the moment, as well as un-
scrupulous, like the reckless and overfed Roman
who bid for the empire at auction, and spent his
fortune in buying the imperial purple, and then
lost his life as the result of securing the object of
his ambition. The Fused people mistook the
voice of the city dailies, which are almost wholly
Tory, for the voice of the people. It bought its
empire off the Tory press even as the Roman afore-
mentioned bought his off the Praetorian Guards ;
and the present trouble arises out of the fact that
it purchased the property at an impossible figure.
Roughly speaking, these were the conditions :
(1) It got no relief in the matter of Federal old-age
pensions, for even the Tory press recognised that the
nation had set its heart on this humane measure, and
it dared not declare against it.
(2) It got no relief in the matter of the cost of taking
over the Northern Territory, for the fact is now so
generally recognised that Australia’s broken and un-
guarded back gste is a perpetual danger that the Tory
press has to clamor as loudly as the Democratic press for
the taking over and settling of Australia’s Lost Province.
(3) It got no relief in the matter of the transcontinental
railway to Kalgoorlie and Perth, for the absolute neces-
sity of that work is now admitted by everybody. The
matter has passed beyond the region of argument, arid-
even if it had been a matter of doubt, which it certainly
isn’t, Bigjoiin Forrest had to be placated.
RIVER SCENERY—McDONNELL RANGES, CENTRAL AUSTRALIA—on the allegedly
desert route of the proposed Port Darwin-Port Augusta transcontinental railway.
(4) It had to stand by the Defence proposals, in theory
at least, because they were Deakin’s own proposals.
So on these matters the Fusion was no better off
than the Democratic Government whose billet it
stole. And on other matters it was much worse
off: —
(1) It had to offer a Dreadnought (value about
£2,000,000) to Britain, because the Dreadnought question
was the handiest one on which, with a decent show of
high-minded though misguided patriotism, it could throw
out the Fisher Government.
(2) It had to give an assurance that it would impose
no Federal direct taxation, and especially no progressive
land-tax. That involved, not only the sacrifice of the
land-tax revenue, hut the sacrifice of the revenue which
would be obtained from hundreds of thousands of new
taxpayers if the great land monopolies were extinguished
and the country thrown open to settlement.
(3) It had to promise to be much more liberal to the
State Governments in the matter of the future division of
the Tariff revenue than the Fisher Ministry proposed to
be, for it bought its empire from the parochial press, and
the price had to be paid.
(4) In order to secure the support of Joe Cook and his
gang of Foreign-traders it was necessary to abandon all
serious idea of raising more revenue through the Customs.
(5) Last of all, the support of the Sydney Tory press
had to be bought by the adoption of a Federal capiral in
a barren and hopeless spot, where the metropolis of Aus-
tralia, regarded as a revenue-producing asset, will be too
absurd to be worth mentioning.
*■**■*
Up to the date of the Fusion there had been six
Australian Ministries. Alfred Deakin was
second in command of one and chief of two. The
Commonwealth had lasted eight years, and for
nearly seven years of that period Deakin was in
office. He had bad a fair share of office. Yet
such was his hunger for office that when he lost it
last year he promptly allied himself with Cook,
who, until Deakin joined him, had never been
reckoned good enough to hold office even once,
and gave away nearly all his alleged principles for
the sake of the nominal leadership of a mainly-
Cook Ministry. Now the first instalment of
the bill has fallen due, and the only way in
which the Fused Ministry is able to pay it is
by charging £1,200,000 of the year’s ordinary
expenditure to loans and by ignoring some of the
largest of its liabilities. How it will stand when
it starts in real earnest to reorganise the post and
telegraph department, to take over the Northern
Territory, to build the two transcontinental rail-
ways, to create the great defence system on which
Deakin built his reputation as an Empire states-
man, to develop that vast liberality to the State
Governments by the promise of which the Fusion
bought the support of the Tory press, and to pre-
sent Britain with that insane Dreadnought which
was also, to some extent, the price of the support
of the Tory press, Heaven only knows. On pre-
sent appearances the Fusion, when it really begins
to meet its liabilities, will have to borrow about
£5,000,000 a year, much of it for purely revenue
purposes. The one device which seems likely to
meet the emergency is the settling of Australia
with hundreds of thousands of new taxpayers; and
that can only be done by breaking up the big
empty estates; and as the State Governments
mostly refuse to move in the matter, the only hope
lies in a Federal progressive land-tax which will
make the holding of great empty estates unpro-
fitable. Without these hundreds of thousands of
new taxpayers Australia has neither the men nor
the money to effectively open up and settle its
empty North, and yet, if the North is not settled,
the end of White Australia is almost certainly
in sight. Still Alfred Deakin has purchased
the renewal of his job by promising that he will
not adopt the only means by which these new tax-
payers can be acquired, so things seem to be at a
deadlock. Meanwhile the Fusion proposes, as
already mentioned, to borrow £1,200.000 to go on
with, and it leaves the problem of the empty
North, and a heap of other problems, to be
settled in the future. It is only in the natural order
of things that the Tory press should give a very
cold approval to the desperate means by which
the Deakin-Cook Government proposes to meet
or rather to postpone, its difficulties. When a
reckless emperor buys the purple off the Prae-
torian guards at an absurd figure, the Praetorians
are seldom grateful eveii if he pays in full. And,
on the other hand, any failure to pay in full only
makes them ten times more aggravated than they
were before.
THE “DESERT” RAILWAY - AND ITS
CRITICS.
Quite a gallon of new literature has come to hand
during the past week re the proposed great
north-to-soutli railway across Australia; and
looking over the said literature carefully The
Bulletin realises that only about half a pint of it
is issued on behalf of the straight cheap line which
this paper advocates. All the rest is in support
of the costly and long-winded eastern deviation.
Putting the matter as briefly as possible, Queens-
land (about 500,000 people) seems to give a large
vote for the deviation because it is to wander
through Queensland ; N.S.W. (about 1,G00,000
people) does the same, because the deviation
is to go through N.S.W.; Victoria (about 1,250,000
people) is in the same interest because the devia-
tion is to connect with Melbourne ; and Tasmania
(nearly 200,000 people) generally takes its
views from Victoria. These purely State
interests —or fancied State interests, for
there is likely to be a very grievous awaken-
ing for some of the people concerned if the cir-
cuitous line is really built—look like providing a
majority for the deviation. And as the deviators
can’t decently admit that their motives are purely
parochial, and are based on an absolute readiness
to sacrifice the interests of Australia for those
of their own back yards, the manufacture of testi-
mony goes on gaily. Hence the gallon of
literature already mentioned.
« * * •
The fact that the long eastern route would pass
through “ the splendid lands of Brunette Downs,
Avon Downs and Austral Downs Stations ” is one
of the most consistent arguments advanced in
favor of the eastern route. These three stations
—in the eastern part of the Territory—
—may be an item of evidence, but they
don’t seem a very big one. The map
shows along, or close to, the direct (Port Darwin
to Port Augusta) railway route the stations of
Katharine, Delamere, Daly Waters, Walhallow
Downs, Eva Downs, Alroy Downs, Alice Springs,
Owen Springs, and a number ifiore; so if the
presence of cattle stations along a route is a
reason why the. railway should be built in that
direction, things seem fairly equal, if indeed the
balance is not in favor of the direct The
alleged waterlessness of the direct line is
expatiated upon by its opponents at great length,
yet when one studies that line on the map there
seems to be at least a suspicion of moisture there-
abouts. Some of the features marked along ithu
direct route, after leaving the big northern rivers,
are Bitter Springs, All Saints Well, Rose Ponds,
Penelope Ponds, Daly Waters, Auld’s Ponds,
King’s Ponds, Milner Lagoon, Johnston Lagoon,
Frew’s Ironstone Pond, Howell’s Ponds, Ross
Creek, Lake Woods, Powell’s Creek, Hunter’s
Creek, Burke’s Creek, Tomkinson’s Creek,
Morphett’s Creek, Attack Creek, Hayward’s
Creek, Tennant’s Creek, Gosse River, Boimey
Creek, Dixon Creek, Wiekliffe Creek, Timing's
Swamp, Barron Creek, Waite River, Burt
Creek, Barry Creek, Alice Springs, Owen
Springs, McClure’s Springs, Alice Creek, Alice
Well, Finke River, Hugh River, Goyder River,
Todd River, Hale River, Frew River, Duffield
Creek, Charlotte Waters, Stevenson Creek,
Dalhousie Creek and Alberga River, etc. That
list deals only with the ground from the
southern extremity of the country of the big
rivers in the Territory to the northern end of the
Port Augusta-Oodnadatta railway. It may
be, of course, that all these creeks, springs,
waters, lagoons, and so on, are mere meta-
phors or figures of speech ; but, if so, it is at least
a pity that the cartographer let his imagination
run riot quite so wildly. Still, the names suggest
a smattering of dampness which calls for con-
sideration.
■* * * »
And apart from any mere smattering of nominal
dampness on the map this concrete fact is worth a
mention : Alice Springs lies in the centre of Aus-
tralia, and would be practically .the midway
station on a straight line of railway from Port
Darwin to Port Augusta—the line which it is
alleged can’t be profitably built because the coun-
try is too dry for any ordinary purpose. During
1908 Alice Springs is officially described as having
had over 17iin. of rain (Daly Waters, further north
on the same desert line, is quoted as having had
25in.). Because of the alleged dryness of the
direct Port Darwin-Port Augusta route the
eastern deviation people want to bring the line
through the west of Queensland, where Birds-
ville has more or less perished for lack of rain, to
Broken Hill, where the rainfall for 1908 was
to Euston, where it was 12£in., and to Wentworth
(Ilfin.); and they desire to build expensive rail-
way connections eastward to Cobar (14fin. of
rain) and Bourke (15fin.). These rainfalls may
not be quite normal; still the figures cast a
shadow of doubt upon the pretence that the oppo-
sition to the straight line is based upon the
drought-stricken nature of the land, and that the
eastern deviation idea has its basis, not in mere
parochialism, but in a large, wild yearning after the
best and dampest interests of Australia.
* * * * ,
In a sense, of course, the term “desert rail-
way ” is correct when applied to the proposed
Port Darwin-Port Adelaide line. There is a sort
of a desert in the road. But there is a sort of a
dese*rt in the road of any transcontinental rail-
way, either from east to west or from north to
south, which Australia can devise. The only pos-
sible way to avoid the desert is to give up all idea,
of transcontinental lines and have mere coastal
railways. Yet transcontinental railways are
essential for defence purposes; and when there
is a large extent of good land on each
side of the continent and a sort of a
desert in between, desert railways are neces-
sary to develop these isolated areas of rich
country. Every transcontinental railway in the
United States is a desert railway in the same
sense that the Port Darwin-Port Augusta line
would be, inasmuch as it crosses a region with less
that lOin. of annual rainfall, just like some paits
of the Australian interior, and also an immense
area with less than 20in. of annual rainfall. A
considerable proportion of the South American,
some of the South African, and all the Egyptian
lines are in the same situation ; and a very similar
gibe may be thrown at some Indian railways in
Scinde, Rajputana and Belucliistan. The Aus-
tralians, like other people, have to make the best
of the country which Providence has given them,
and build their transcontinental desert railways
According to the rainfall map shown on page 138
of the Commonwealth Official Year Book
for 1908, the shortest cut across what is
commonly called the desert would be arrived
at by taking the railway from Port Dai -
win to Perth, but that would be more a
coastal than a transcontinental line. The route
which comes next in order as including the
largest extent of well-watered land and the least
desert (if Alice Springs can be called desert) is
that from Port Darwin to Port Augusta. The
one which covers the greatest extent of dry land
is the proposed deviation through the western
parts of Queensland and N.S.W., taking in
Broken Hill with its lamentable last year’s down-
pour of 94in.
* * * *
The western part of N.S.W., it may be regret-
fully mentioned, doesn’t look a very promising
place through which to deviate any transcon-
tinental line at great public expense—assuming,
that is. that the line is built,' not merely with the
idea of getting money spent in “ our ” State, but
with a view to the best interests of Australia at
large. N.S.W. is growing in population more
rapidly than any other- State ; but despite this
fact its western district, with the Din. or lOin. rain-
fall, through which it is proposed that the de-
viated railway should go, seems to be a decaying
proposition, either through natural disadvantages
or by reason of bad government. Between the
census of 1891 and that of 1901—though that
period did not include the great drought of 1902
the N.S.W. counties west of the Darling which
lost population were 17 in number—Barrona,
Culgoa, Delalah, Evelyn, Farnell, Fitzgerald,
Gunderbooka, Landsborough, Mootwingee, Poole,
Pandora, Tara. Tongowoko, Ularara, Windeyer,
Yantara and Young. Those which gained popu-
lation were only five in number, and practically
all the gain was in Yaiicowinna, the county in
which Broken Hill is located, which county is
also now on the decrease. One county (Inara)


remained absolutely stationary with 470 people.
Among'the 25 counties on the N.S.W. plains east
of the Darling, 15 diminished in population during
the same period. If the proposed deviation of the
transcontinental line connects with Melbourne via,
Swan Hill, its final course will be through six Vic-
torian counties—Tatchera, Gunbower, Bendigo,
Rodney, Dalhousie and Bourke —and of these
Gunbower and Dalhousie are diminishing in
population, and Rodney is practically stationary.
Concerning the south-west of Queensland, through
which it is proposed that the deviated railway
should run, figures are scarce; but Birdsville, the
farthest south-west town, is accused in Pitoh’s
Almanao of having 60 people, and being in a
country which is “principally stony plains and
sandhills.”
If * * *
The Bulletin is quite prepared to admit that
there are heaps of drawbacks about the direct
transcontinental railway from Port Darwin to
Port Augusta, despite the fact that Alice Springs
in the centre of the alleged desert, had last year
of rain against 9Jin. at Broken Hill on the
rival route. Still the so-called desert must be
crossed if there is ever to be a transcontinental
railway ; and on this route the proportion of well-
watered land is about the largest, and the stretch
of desert nearly the shortest. And there are these
other considerations: (1) The direct route opens
up about the largest possible area of the Territory,
and as over one-half of the well-watered part of
Australia (the part with a rainfall of over 40in.
per annum) is in the Territory (there are in Aus-
tralia 167,921 square miles of country with over
40in. of annual rainfall, and of this the Territory
contains 86,500 square miles), that province really
seems worth opening up ; (2) it seems a reckless
sort of business to take over the Territory and
then build a railway right out of it into Queens-
land, N.S.W. and Victoria, and leave the Terri-
tory largely undeveloped; (3) it seems a remark-
able business to do this when the railway will be
longer, and will go through a country with, in
many parts, an inferior rainfall and a diminishing
population. A great deal has been made by the
deviation jieople of the fact that no one State
should be allowed to dictate terms to the rest of
Australia, and that the route of the railway should
be left an open question. But S.A. at least olfers
the Territory (over 500,000 square miles of the
best-watered land in Australia) in return
for its dictation, and when N.S.W. dictated that
the Australian capital must be within its borders
it offered nothing in return. A great deal has
also been made about the greatly increased dis-
tances by rail from Townsville, Rockhampton,
Brisbane and Sydney to Port Darwin by the
direct line as compared with the eastern devia-
tion, but these figures are mostly lies and partly im-
posture. Many of them are based on theassumption
that if the trans-Australian line is taken circui-
tously through Western Queensland, Rockhampton
(say) will extend its railway westward and make a
direct connection ; while, if the line goes a little
further west through better country, Rockhampton
won’t connect, but its people, when they want to
reach Port Darwin, will take a gigantic circum-
bendibus by Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide.
The same deranged process of reasoning is often
applied to the other eastern seaports. It is hardly
a convincing process. In fact, it seems rather
clumsy than otherwise.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Death-Stroke at Usury.
The section of the N.S.W. community which
earns a crust, and a bit over, by lending folks
money at an exorbitant rate of interest, bumped a
hideous snag a few days ago. Incidentally the
happening ,was fraught with important conse-
quences to the community, for it established
publicly, once and for all, that henceforth even
the most indigent citizen isn’t obliged to pay ex-
cessive charges to usurers unless'so disposed. The
thing came about through Mrs. Mary McDonald,
of North Sydney, borrowing money from M.
Davidson, an Elizabeth-street (Sydney) finan-
cier. The exact details don’t matter; the main
points are that the interest was high and the
oailiff was punctual. Then the lady and her
husband fled together to their solicitor, one
William H. Drew, and while the bailiff was toiling
after the manner of his kind. Drew browsed
among the intricacies of the Moneylenders and
Infants Loans Act (1905). And suddenly he
arrived at the view that there was a means by
which Davidson might be smitten, and at scant
cost. It has been generally known, of course, for
years that a “ harsh and unconscionable ” money-
lending bargain may under certain circumstances
be reviewed ; but hitherto it has been the accepted
opinion (1) that such relief can only be sought
where the moneylender has first sued, and (2) that
even then it can only be obtained in.Eqinty. Now,
poor people and peopleof moderate rneaiis(who are
the ones that, in the nature of things, do mo3t
borrowing) can’t afford to go to Equity, which is
a notoriously expensive jurisdiction. Moreover,
Equity bears the justly-earned reputation of being
the most leisurely of all methods of litigating. In
a case like the above, by the time counsel had
been briefed, and a Statement of Claim drawn up,
and a Statement of Defence filed, and the case set
down for hearing, at least four months and con-
ceivably eight or 12 would have elapsed. And by
that time the bailiff would have retired
and the security he guarded be dispersed to the
four winds. Acting on his interpretation of the
Moneylenders and Infants Loans Act, Solicitor
Drew briefed a junior barrister to go forth-
with before the Banco Court, and move
for a rule nisi calling upon Davidson to
show cause why the whole transaction
shouldn’t be reopened at once with a view to
immediately relieving the borrower of the pay-
ment of any interest that might be found, by the
Court, to be excessive. The Court reeled, figura-
tively, in its amazement at the suggestion, and this
dialogue occurred :
Mr. Justice Piuno : Why do you not make this applica-
tion to the Court of. Equity ?
Mr. Pitt said that the matter came under subsection 2
of section 1 of the Moneylenders and Infant Loans Act,
which provided tiiat application should apply to the
Court in which the moneylender would sue, which would
he either the Supreme Court or the District Court,
The Acting Chief Justice : No action has been broug’ht
yet.
Mr. Pitt: It is not necessary. Sub-section 2 provided
that the Court should exercise the power notwithstand-
ing that the time for the repayment of the principal or
any instalments might not have arrived.
Mr. Justice Prixo: It seems an extraordinary thing to
ask this Court.to do this on affidavits when we have not
the proper means of inquiring into the matter.
Mr. Pitt : The Court, by section 7, can make all such
orders as it may deem necessary or proper for the
effectual carrying out of the provi.-ions of the Act.
Mr. Justice Prino : Is there an English Act like this?
Mr. Pitt: Yes; but the procedure there is laid down
under the Judicature Act. Here our Act lays down the
rules or mode of procedure. I have not been able to find
a case similar to this.
Then Mr. Justice Cohen remarked, dazedly, that
“the interest appeared to workout at about 70
per cent.,” and the rule nisi was promptly granted,
and the Court ordered further that on condition
the applicant paid the £7B 11s. claimed by
Davidson into court the bailiff be withdrawn. She
paid in the money. But it was a mere matter of
form. Davidson gave up the struggle, and
allowed the lady to take the full amount out of
court, paid all costs, and threw himself, financially
and otherwise, on her mercy. Putin the simplest
terms, the meaning of the above happening is
that, at the present moment, any borrower in
N.S.W. who considers he is being treated usuri-
ously may go to the Supreme or District Court
and get his case looked into on the spot. Assum-
ing he has already paid money to a usurer at an
inequitable rate, he can get it all back. Assuming
he has not paid his first instalment of in-
terest, he can get the amount he has to
pay cut down to a reasonable figure. Also
he can ask the Court to abate all “fines,”
“bonuses.” “renewal charges” and other fake-
ments which appeal to it as over the odds, and
force the lender to reimburse him for any pay-
ments of the sort that have been already extorted.
And the Court will instantly comply. The money-
lender may have induced the borrower to pledge
himself in writing or otherwise not to take advan-
tage of the Act. It won’t affect the issue. . The
borrower will retain intact all his rights as against
the usurer, agreements, pledges and so forth not-
withstanding. And finally, even if the fortune of
war goes against the borrower and the Court finds
that, having regard to the security he had to offer,
the interest-charges made were reasonable, (1)
judgment will be speedy, and (2) the cost of liti-
gation will be exceedingly moderate. Verily
there are troublous days ahead for Cornstalk
usury; and when borrowers and their legal ad-
visers start to realise the exact strength of things,
the wail of the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan
and Discount Co. will be loud in the land.
The State that Won’t Tax Itself.
For the sixth year in succession Westralia has
had a deficit ; and the last one, amounting to just
o ver £lOO,OOO, brings the total of the half-dozen to
£550,114. To make matters worse, this shocking
drift has occurred in spite of the fact that the
State has, on the one hand, been borrowing every
penny it could lay its fingers on so as to reduce its
ordinary expenditure, and, on the other hand, has
been selling land wholesale and grabbing the pro-
ceeds. Instead, however, of facing the situation
boldlv, Newton Moore, the State’s futile
Premier, whines that it’s all due to Federa-
tion ; and Quintan, the Speaker, having
the dignity of his position to live up
to, announces his wish to horsewhip or fry or do
some other pleasant thing to the whole/‘Com-
monwealth crowd Biojoiin Forrest to be
whipped first and fried afterwards for his special
sins. Yet the truth is that the founders of the
Commonwealth treated the West with remarkable
tenderness, and went out of their way to make it
plain sailing for the State. They wanted to inau-
gurate Federation with the least possible irrita-
tion ; and having the good name of all Australia
to look after, they tried to put every State
into the position of being able to escape
a deficit. Westralia said it had special diffi-
culties ; probably it had no worse difficul-
ties than Queensland, yet because it had
shamefully neglected its own development it was
given some special concessions. It would want
time, it said, to readjust its finances ; and pend-
ing that readjustment a special tariff was fixed up
for its benefit. But, having got this concession,
its Government played a shameless confidence
trick, and didn’t make the smallest effort to get
local revenue in the place of the revenue which it
knew it was to gradually lose through the aboli-
tion of inter-State tariffs, and for the revenue it
knew it must lose because its boom couldn’t last
for ever. This shows in plain black and white
what has happened from first to last :
Common- Total
State wealth per Head of
Taxation. Taxation. Population.
1902 .. £173,582 £1,335,614 £7 16
1903 .. 221,247 1,396,002 7 2 6
1904 .. 235,114 1,262,010 6 3 6
1905 .. 221,738 1,172,064 5 9 5
1906 .. 260,609 1,030,813 4 18 8
1907 .. 266,151 952,617 4 12 4
1908 .. 277,463 998,928 4 14 3
1909 .. 296,600 886,654 4 7 3
This, of course, is exclusive of revenue derived
from State services, such as railways and water
supply ; and in some cases ridiculously inadequate
charges have been made for those services also.
The railway revenue, for instance, which reached
£1,610,394 in 1903-4, was in the past year only
£1,520,453, in spite of the fact that during the
past six years £2,706,365 of borrowed money has
been put into new lines. This ought to have
meant increased taxation, for it meant a
bigger interest bill, and if that bigger
interest bill wasn’t being met out of the
railway revenue, there was only one honest
thing to do—to meet it out of taxation. Instead
of doing anything like that, however, the total
taxation per head of the population was actually
permitted to dwindle down from £7 Is. 6d. in 1902
and £7 2s. 6d. in 1903 to £4 7s. 3d. in J 908-9.
When this drift towards bankruptcy has hitherto
been pointed out, the cowards or incompetents in
charge of affairs have always made one poor
excuse for letting things go on drifting. ‘‘But
see,” they have said, “how our population of
women and children has been increasing; and
women and children are not taxpayers,” It is
not true; it is even not as true as it ought
to be. But assume for the moment that
they are not taxpayers; and assume further
that not one adult immigrant has arrived in
Westralia during the past seven years. Assume,
in short, that the taxpaying population of
Westralia is not more than it was seven years
ago ; then, even on that basis, the taxation to-day
would amount to no more than £5 11s. lid. per
head, as against £7 Is. 6d. in 1902. But that is
putting the matter in far too favorable a light;
for the list above shows that, while the State is
paying £448,960 less in Customs and Excise, in-
stead of asking it to make up that money in some
other way, all the extra that the State has col-
lected is £123,018. Had the Commonwealth
during the past year collected the old £1,335,614
from the Westralian people, and put the extra
£448,960 into its own Treasury, Newton Moore
might possibly have had some cause to complain ;
but it did nothing of the sort—it left the £448,960
in the pockets of the Westralian people, and it
told Newton Moore to either go ahead and
collect it in his own way. or so- reduce his State
expenditure that he could get along without it.
But Newton Moore does neither. His Govern-
ment is apparently too cowardly or too incom-
petent to attack the untouched sources of revenue ;
and so the drift continues, and the deficit is
passed on to the baby to struggle with later on,
when no doubt the infant will have plenty of
troubles of its own.
The Unimportance of Being Johnson.
One of these days it may be found advisable to
appoint a Commission to inquire into the reason
of the unsatisfactoriness of people named John-
son. It is difficult to remember a prominent John-
son against whom this country hasn’t serious cause
of complaint, and of them all Government Statisti-
cian Johnson, of Tasmania, is probably the worst.
He is a frantic apologist for the borrowing disease,
and seems to regard debt as a virtue. Also, he is
a soporific person, who is always making comfort-
ing calculations about the “hidden values”
created by the expenditure of loan moneys, to
soothe this country to sleep wheu it is half-
inclined to wake up and pay off some of its debts.
Johnson’s consoling doctrine of hidden values
goes something after this fashion :
(1) Tasmania borrows £4,000,000, and builds railways
with the money.
(2) These railways earn £300,000 a year by carrying
goods and passengers.
(3) To carry the same goods and passengers by the old
coach and bullock-waggon methods would have cost
£1,000,000 a year.
(4) The country thus saves £700,000 a year.
(5) That sum represents interest at 4 per cent, on a
capital of £17,500,000.
(0) Therefore Tasmania, by borrowing £4,000,000, gets
£4,000,000 worth of railways and £17,500,000 worth of
“ hidden values," total £21,500,000 ; so it is obvious that
Tasmania has been made immensely rich, and can safely
borrow a lot more.
Following Johnson’s logic a little further, it
might be reasoned that, if a man gets a cablegram
from the interior of Africa, saying that his father
has died there and left him Is. instead of the £lOOO
he expected, he is really worth £2OOO, for it would
probably have cost £2OOO in the time of
the crusades to send the news of his
father’s death from the interior of Africa.
In the pre-railway days a Tasmanian farmer
might cart his goods laboriously to a port at
£1 per ton freight, and then sell them for ex-
port at a price which left him a fair living ; and
it is quite possible that he now sends them by rail
at 2s. a ton freight and sells them at a price which
yields him a fair living. But he hasn’t 18s. in his
pocket for every ton of goods he sent to port since
tile railway opened. He may have something in
his pocket, certainly, but a good part of his
reward is the satisfaction of knowing.that he has
kept the business, whereas if he had stuck to
bullock-dray methods while other countries
adopted railroads he would have no business left
at all. The money a person might have spent
but didn’t, on carting produce to market, or on
anything else, is a poor kind of hidden value to
borrow on, especially if the money which wasn’t
spent was money the person never had to spend.
It would be equally reasonable to point out that
Australia has available for railway building to-day
all the money it saved by not sending 160,000 extra
soldiers to the Boer war, but neither it nor John-
son can find the money. Johnson further holds
that the Australian Government “ should, at.once
discontinue the improper method ” of paying for
new works out of revenue, and borrow hard. Also
a Sydney daily accuses him of this :
Mr. Johnson goes on to explain that the success of the
Australian States in the past has undoubtedly been due
to the SACRIFICES which the early pioneers made from
time to time in making provision for the opening up of
Australia’s vast virgin lands by means of public loans.
Truly the man who calls the act of borrowing
money and leaving the bill to posterity a “ sacri-
fice ”is the limit. He is the world’s record. The
story of these pioneers and their “ sacrifices” can
be told in a few words. They regarded them-
selves asa peculiar and special people who shouldn’t
be expected to pay their way like other nations.
They declined to charge themselves with income-
tax, land-tax, probate. Excise or stamp duties.
They paid very little in Customs duties
and not much in local rates. They pre-
ferred to sell the land and spend the proceeds
as revenue, and to charge their public works to
loans. When the expenditure of loan money
raised the value of public lands, they sold these
lands, and used the proceeds as revenue and raised
more loans. When the expenditure of loan money
increased the value of their owii private lands
they kept all the profit—many of them went to
England to spend it—and just floated some more
loans. Australia has a lot to thank its old borrow-
ing pioneers for ; if they were alive now, and the
community started to pay its debts to them, the
axe would be worn out before it was half through.
They are gone, but their apologist Johnson
remains. Johnson seems a fair and reasonable
mark for public vengeance.

Legal Tender and Affability.
The present Federal Government will be remem-
bered as the Government which never quite
finished anything. It is, above all things, an
Affable Ministry. The last matter of importance
on which it affabled was the Silver Coinage Bill.
For very many years it has been a grievance that
Australia has no silver coinage of its own. This
wouldn’t matter in the least if the British shilling
or florin was an honest coin ; there is little use in
having our own coinage as a matter of mere.vanity.
But the British silver coin is a base thing and a
mere token. The 20 silver shillings for which
Australia pays Britain £1 of good gold are worth
from 6s. Bd. to 10s., according to the varying price
of metal. Australia digs up a bit of silver
and sells it to the British mint for from 4d. to Gd.,
and the British mint shoves it through a machine
which makes certain marks on it, and sells it back
to Australia for 12d. Out of this device Australia
loses about £lOO,OOO a year, and having grown
weary of the thankless arrangement it has
pounded on Bull’s front door clamoring for its
own silver money. The point was at last con-
ceded, and, as a matter of form, the necessary Bill
was last week being passed through the House of
Reps. And then, as usual, Australia realised
the disadvantages of having a desperately
Polite Government which can never by any
chance be quite complete about anything.
A member arose to urge that the old
British silver coinage should remain legal
tender here alongside the new Australian silver.
Of course, if British silver money is legal tender
here it is hard to limit the amount which
tnav circulate, and the more circulates the less
benefit Australia gets from its hard-won conces-
sion. Considering the obvious objections, one
would thinkthatoniy a very powerful motive would
induce any Government to retain British silver as
legal tender in Australia. Yet all the reason
assigned was that “tourists and visitors from
England” would find it awkward if their silver
money was of no value here, and it certainly
seems an amazingly incapable reason. The British
tourist starts on his five weeks' voyage with
probably about 15s. in loose change, for no tourist
humps that sort of stuff around by the cwt.
He may strike the British Crown colony of
Cyprus on his way, and there he finds that the
British “bob” and penny are strangers in the land ;
there is instead a sort of Turkish coinage. He next
strikes British-governed Egypt, and finds a special
Egyptian silver coinage with the 10-piastre piece
largely in evidence. He may call in later at the
British Crown colony of India, and he meets the
rupee, half-rupee, anna, etc.—l 6 annas to the
rupee. A little further on he strikes the British
Crown colony of Ceylon, and there he meets the
rupee and cent—loo cents to the rupee. And at
long last he arrives at Australia with perhaps an
odd 6d. of English silver left. And lest he should
be enraged—despite his experiences of British
methods in Cyprus, Egypt, India and Ceylon—at
finding that last 6d. not legal tender in this country,
and for fear he should be too tired or too super-
cilious to get it changed for an Australian 6d.
at the steamboat’s drinkery before coming ashore,
the Deakin-Cook Ministry proposes to knock a
very considerable hole in a scheme which is the
hard-earned result of many years’ negotiation.
This desire to be more English than the English
themselves is a painful excess of affability.

A Trip to Chinatown.
By instalments the world has been learning the
truth in the matter of Elsie Sigel, granddaughter
of the well-known General Sigel, of the Civil
War—the girl who made a brief cablegrammic
smash a few weeks ago. The body of Miss Sigel,
a handsome girl and the child of wealthy parents,
was found in a trunk on the premises of a squalid
Chinaman in one of the by-ways of New York.
She, like many more girls of her class, had been
an “earnest Christian worker’’among the Chow
population; so for about a minute the dead girl
stood in the limelight as a martyr. But
the police had no delusions on the subject,
and when they had hunted out 40 of her
love-letters addressed to one Chinaman and
200 addressed to another the halo departed.
The police theory, put briefly, is that there isn’t
such a thing as a real Chinese convert, and that
among the multitude of allegedly devout girls who
go to Chinatown in pursuit of the heathen’s soul,
an appalling propurtion are degenerates in pursuit
of the worst species of immorality. There are
many reasons given for this. The spacious gar-
ment of hypocrisy serves as a disguise; if a
society girl regularly haunted a set of residential
chambers in which a number of unmarried white
men kept house, the explanation that she was
bent on missionary business would be scorned,
but she can put on her halo and her uplifted
expression, and take her Bible in her hand, and go
to spend hours among the bachelors and grass-
widowers of Chinatown, with the applause of the
Church for her reward. Then Chinatown lies far
away from the haunts of fashion, and the
cynical eye of observation isn’t fixed upon it.
Some of the girls of her own set whom the
missioner meets there are unworldly and un-
observant fanatics ; the rest have the same good
reasons for secrecy that she has herself, and the
members of the sisterhood can’t afford to give
each other away. The resident women of China-
town don’t whisper the story in fashionable
church circles, for they don’t go to church ; and
the Chow lover doesn’t inadvertently let it out at
his club after too much Bourbon whisky, for
Chinatown doesn’t belong to fashionable clubs.
Good-Night!
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“ If we pro to war, and it lasts only a little time, it will
cost £1,500,000,000. But if we should lose, it will be
good-night.”— Lord Charles Beresford.
Spkung from the rocks and suckled by the tides,
Stripling and squire of earth’s best hardihood,
Knighted of old by God’s own sword, abides
The little land that sires our brother-blood :
What if across that strip of striving sea—
Which oft-times from spent fights hath boister-
ously,
Hounding some torn fleet from the lower lands,
Twisted and leapt and clapped its flailing hands —
What if one hour a rough-lipped wind and wet
Blew up with choking blackness in its wings,
To shroud that home of immemorial kings,
Whereon, erstwhile, the sun hath never set,
And one veiled Shape that was a people’s might,
Groping should cry where, glazen-eyed and stark,
Glory lay crownless in the shivering dark—
“ The day hath failed we dreamed was infinite : .
It is ‘good-night! ’”
And if it be that swallowing blackness blot
So much of olden pride and ancient praise,
How should its clutching fingers cover not
This realm of warmer seas and wider ways?
Endlessly peice hath swaddled her secure—
Shall empty peace all-eudlossl.y endure
When, to the sudden glut of spoiling, haste
Robber and raptor from the ocean-waste ?
Ringed by her plunging lazy leagues of sea,
Your homeland’s heart beneath her bosomed hills
Beats sleepily ; the cramped North overspills,
And slant eyes twist to southward jealously;
Masters, shall she your maid-land vestal white
Reproach you after, crying, “ What avail
Weaponless hands to battle mace and mail ?
Voices all-valorous, eves that scorned the light.
Give you good-night! ”
Out from your naked sands the tide slips forth
To strange wide worlds that bound the undersea,
R icing keen-eared by west and east and north,
Where shadows mass and sounds ring distantly.
Beating your stoic sands the tide rides back,
Bringing from reef and outer ocean-track
Word of dark coasts where bulking squadrons
went.
Tally of keels and alien armament.
As oft aforetime would its lapping breath
Have armed you to the proving faithfully
Bit that ye would not! Pray the gods ye be
When blows the battle-wind that winnoweth
True souls from those of knave and Sybarite-
Waked not in flame to watch the city fall:
Look to your guardless gates, word-merchants all,
Or bid to burning sea and sacred height
Bitter good-night!
Fervent and strong and stable, yielding not
To wide-mouthed madness born of words and
wine.
Or lotus-eating indolence, begot
Of windy pride of nationhood and line,
Be alway ! —else what make you ? Would ye lag,
Hiding'behind the glory of a flag?
Fronting the north your reeded reaches run
With wallowing buffalo for garrison;
Fringing the north, guarded by spit and bar,
Deserted hummock, shoal and nakedness—
As your own folly void and limitless—
Your lush plains rich with rolling grasses are.
O untrained hand and wilful sightless eye,
Strive, lest through outer force and inner schism
Haply ye wear the cere-cloth for the chrism,
Having for dirge your driven freedom’s cry,
' Good-night !
Good-bye! ”
VICTORIA.

The optimism bestowed by a cheerful
climate is a great asset to the Australian cricketers.
Truly this happy confidence can be imparted by
judicious applications of D.0.L., the whisky of the
wise. Eut if both sides achieve this added nerve
steadiness the balance of power remains the same.
Hence the Englishmen’s only hope is to have
themselves born in Australia, besides achieving
the essential assistance of the scholarly brand.*
And there is this special consideration : When a
woman marries, after rioting in her early life
with a man in her own circle, she is liable to keep
meeting him, and he is a perpetual reminder of
the past as well as a possible danger in the present
(it was the unpleasant habit of meeting Stanford
White which caused Thaw to do that lament-
able shooting business); but the Chow lover can
be dropped. It is only necessary to give up
Chinese missions, and the thing is done. The
heathen laundry man doesn’t turn up at rich men’s
dinner-tables, or in the dress circle of the Opera
House, to be a skeleton at the feast in after years;
at the very worst he comes inscrutably around to
the back door with the wash, and it is always
possible to give the wash to somebody else. And
on top of everything else, Chinatown is a new sen-
sation for the idle daughters of society ; and it has
the squalid charm of mystery, In fact, it is the
one place in New York—and in almost every other
city which possesses a Chinatown—where the
millionaire’s daughter can go to the dogs with
hardly any risk of publicity, and with the ap-
plause of the Church and the halo of saintliness
for her reward. Of course, there have been
horrible scandals at intervals. More than one girl
belonging to New York society has taken so badly
to opium or other devices that she has married
her pet Chow and stayed in Chinatown, or else
has just stayed in Chinatown on general prin-
ciples. Yet it is probably too much to expect that
the Sigel revelation and another hundred like it
will in any way diminish the Church’s yearning
after its yellow “ brother ” or its craving to intro-
duce him to the white man’s country, or that the
tabernacle will cease to sool the misguided white
girl on to missions in China and Chinatown. To the
parsonical mind there seems to be more joy over
one Chow who cuts his hair short, and puts on
Eulopean clothes and a hard hat, and calls himself
a “ Clistian,” than in 99 decent white men who
don’t go to the mission class to get white girls to
teach them the alphabet. The Chinaman, by the
way, on whose deserted premises Miss Sigel’s
body was found was regarded as one of the best
specimens of the converted and perfectly civilised
Chow. He wore his hair cut short, and decked
himself with Eulopean clothes and a hard hat.
♦
The Same Old Fish Story.
Melbourne City Council positively threatens to
“do something” towards improving and widening
the distribution of fish in the “bloomin’ metrol-
lopis,”as the hawkers call it. To that end the
Council in general has ordered a report on the
subject from its markets committee, which body
has acquired a solid reputation for not doing
something. This present re-awakening to the
absurdity of the dearness and scarcity of fish in
Melbourne is the result of a movement by one of
the suburban councils. The City Council’s mar-
kets committee, on being formally notified of this
“movement,” wanted to know what the suburban
malcontents were hinting at. In fact, the markets
committee grew impudent as well as angry.
When a polite request for an improved state of
things excites the dander of people who are
more or less responsible for a bad state
of things, it seems time for somebody
other than those angry people to take the
improvements in hand. For instance, what can
be expected of Mr. Alderman Crichton, chair-
man of the City Council’s markets committee?
He says there is “ not the monopoly at the fish
market that some councillors endeavor to prove.
The trouble is with the senders, and there is a
ring that controls supplies.” Here is a worship-
ful alderman who would represent the fish-ring
which controls supplies to the market, as being a
malign institution existing outside the market
and having no connection with any monopoly.
The “ring” is the monopoly, and the market is its
field of operations, and its operations are devoted
to keeping up the price of marine animals. There
are few articles of general consumption the supply
whereof is not controlled by certain persons who
conspire to keep up its price. Fruit is, in a
measure, uncontrollable ; but when the hawkers
would flood the city with cheap fruit, the City
Council hunts them from place to place, and
would imprison them if it could, in the interests
of shopkeepers, who are keeping up the price.
And if ever the hawkers are in a position to offer

Premier Weary as an Acrobat.
Thomas Adolphus Bent flopped into the lime-
light again last week by reason of the arrival of
the bill for the Royal Commission that inquired
into his land deals. The document was brief but
instructive. It ran : Reporting and typewriting,
£124 12s. ; witnesses’ fees, £l2 6s. 3d.; stationery,
etc., £35 ss. 7d. ; refreshments and incidental
expenses, £7l 18s. 6d. ; counsels’ fees, £536
6s. Bd. The bill is large, undoubtedly, and the
country has only a loud srnell and a splash of
whitewash to show for it; yet the best thing to do
with it would have been to pay up and pass
on into purer air. But apparently Bent
had been underground-engineering again ; any-
how Labor member Outtrim immediately moved
that the vote be reduced by £1 as an expression
of opinion that Thomas Adolphus’ expenses
should also be paid by the fool public. Then
ensued the spectacle of an Assembly whose honor
lie had disregarded rushing to the further white-
washing of Bent —Bent of the infamous Irvine-
Bent railway strike-breaking Bill. Anstey.
Hannah, Outtrim and others combined
with Bent’s former colleagues, Mackey,
McLeod and Bowser in representing the
land-jobber as a much-maligned angel and
a persecuted innocent. In asking that the
Commission’s account be liquidated. Premier
Weary had intimated his Government’s intention
to take no action on the Commission’s findings,
and he gave no hint of any desire to
pay Bent’s expenses ; but as member after
member spoke sweetly of the Brighton boomster
it became apparent that Outtrim’s amendment
would be carried. So .John Weary hastily
grabbed his billet in both hands and somersaulted
as gracefully as he could. He would pay Bent’s
expenses. What this spineless grovelling really
amounts to can he realised when it is remembered
that within the last two months a Parliamentary
committee has declared Bent guilty of misleading
the Governor and thereby obtaining an elec-
tioneering advantage, of having spent thousands
of pounds of public funds irregularly, and of hav-
ing instructed a public officer to violate the law ;
while a Royal Commission has found that he
interfered with properly constituted bodies in the
purchase of lands and thereby lost the State much
money; that he bought land without Parlia-
mentary sanction, and paid prices in excess of the
market value ; and that he misled Parliament in
the matter of his Brighton land, and subsequently
gave the House a very dubious explanation of his
position. But for his land-jobbing practices and
his general reputation, the Commission would
never have been required. It fully justified its ap-
pointment by finding Bent guilty of many of tbe
charges laid against him, and it is enough that the
State has to pay its share of the bill without being
saddled with the boomster’s share. Yet, if the
act itself is bad enough, Premier John Weary’s
manner of doing it was worse.
A Grotesque Possibility.
This sort of inspired statement has been appear-
ing repeatedly in the Fused press during the past
few weeks :
There is only one member of Parliament who is re-
garded as a possible High Commissioner. That is Mr.
G. H. Reid.
It suggests that the DEAKOOK-ites contemplate a
particularly cynical bit of jobbery. Evidently G.
Reid’s recent subsidence and graceful withdrawal
of his claims as co.-leader with Dkakin of the
heterogenous crowd that sunk its principles for
office is to be rewarded at the expense of the
Commonwealth. It is contemplated that the
politician who was held too much of a back-number
to be eligible to represent the Tories of Australia
in a Tory-Liberal Parliamentary coalition shall
represent all shades of Australian political feel-
ing in the place • where representation of
the wrong sort is going to do most harm.
As to Reid’s undesirability as a representative of
all Australia there can be no question. Said the
same sheet, which printed the above-quoted item,
at the conclusion of its paragraph :
The strong argument in favor of Mr. G. H. Reid, it is
urged, is that he was such a great success when he went
to Great Britain to represent New South Wales in 1897.
There is a germ of truth in the assertion that
G. Reid did well in the Cold Land in 1897. But
affairs have altered in the last 12 years. Reid
may have stood still during all that time, but
Australia hasn’t. Recent happenings have proved
that nowadays N.S.W.’s one-time Premier and
Main Joss doesn’t represent more than a negli-
gible fraction even of his own State. He is a
sort of Freetrader in a land where Freetrade
of every description is dead and buried,
a clamant State Frighter, an opponent of
the Australian navy idea, an advocate of soldier-
ing by small boys as a means of side-stepping the
compulsory military service of adults which the
common sense of the Commonwealth has declared
for ; in brief, he is a frank assailant of every big
Australian idea that bas been put forward of late
years, a Conservative in a nation of democrats,
a parochialist amongst people whose aspirations
are increasingly nationalist. He has been
a failure, for ail his native cleverness in most
things. He is 64, and old for his years. His very
assets are calculated to seriously handicap a High
Commissioner. His recognised metier is that of a
funny man. He has been making folks guffaw
for so long that the thing has become an incurable
habit. He can’t face an audience of school
children on Empire Day without sending it into
convulsions anent the hugeness of his girth. None
of these qualities is desirable in a position which
must be largely ambassadorial. Australia wants
its High Commissioner —the man who is to speak
for it to the nations—to be taken seriously. It
demands of him a certain dignity. There are few
circumstances, probably, more calculated to call
down discredit and ridicule and distrust on this
continent’s loan-bowed head than the spectacle
of G. H. Reid making at a public banquet in
London in the capacity of Australia’s mouthpiece,
one of the low-comedy speeches which are his
strong oratorical suit these days. There is the
possibility that the Fused Government won’t live
long enough to perpetrate this wrong, but that it
means to do it if it is given life and strength there
seems a great probability.
Unless Premier Murray gets his house-to-house
canvass of electors completed pretty speedily, or
unless he uses the Federal rolls, next Vic. State
election will be even more lop-sided than usual.
The preponderance of electors in city districts as
compared with those of the country was bad
enough under the old state of affairs ; but the new
rolls make things worse. In metropolitan and
urban electorates women registered themselves as
fast as the registrars could put their names down ;
but in the country their gradual habits and their
distance from the registrar’s office caused
wholesale omissions from the rolls. Conse-
sequently, while the suburban Boroondara,
Essendon, Hawthorn, and Jika Jika now have
over 11,000 electors apiece, the rural Benam-
bra, Gunbower, Korong, Swan Hill and Wal-
halla have none of them more than 4000.
As things stand, the 20 metropolitan members
represent 201,743 electors ; the 40 country mem-
bers, 213,013. As the country electors are to a
large extent landowners, it follows that the man
with the “stake in the country” is getting about
twice as much representation as the city worker.
Democrats had a hard fight to gain one man one
vote, but, as long as one vote has twice the value
of another, democrats are robbed of much of the
fruits of their toil. This discrepancy, in repre-
sentation, by the way, accounts for much of the
facility with which the “poor farmer” passes his
burdens on to the State —that is to say, on to the
city worker. For on top of the pull he has in the
Assembly, it is the owner of the soil who has
practically all the pull in the House of Rich Land-
lords.

West’s Pictures still occupy Sydney
Palace, and the programme for the current week
is largely humorous. The Story of Jimmy and
the Adventures of Willie are breezy, brightly put
and not too long. But the star picture at West’s
is that showing how the United States was in-
vaded by Japanese forces. The film starts with
the Jap servant, who is a member of the Intelli-
gence Staff and whose reports are taken away
in the night by the airship. (Those mysterious
lights lately seen over Australia and Maoriland
may possibly be the lights of that same ship.)
Then comes the battle, during which a white
audience sits aghast at the slaughter of a white
race by a yellow invader, wondering if it is pro-
phetic. However, on the screen, the white man
in the grisly end comes out on top of the heap.
The trouble is, of course, that, when it happens
here in reality, owing to the tricks and capers of
sundry gentlemen in Melbourne, it will probably
end the other way. It is terrible to think of Aus-
tralian patriotism being flogged up by a Yankee
cinematograph film.

Nothing has occurred to the detriment of
the panto, at Sydney Criterion. Miss Ruth
Lincoln is well; her disreputable titled parents
are in excellent condition ; Miss Meredro is going
strong and tunefully ; and the minor characters
are bearing up with fortitude. All these happen-
ings may be observed at two afternoon and six
evening performances till the Crack of Doom or
further notice.

On Saturday, Her Majesty’s (the Sydney
one) is going to rise resplendent out of the ashes
of yesterweek and resound with song and jest
and good cheer generally. For on that day
(or rather night) the co. which inter-
prets “The King of Cadonia” is billed
to appear. The co. in question contains the
adorable Bert Gilbert, a prima donna, two bari-
tones and a comedienne, besides an extensive
and shapely chorus ; so if there is not something
doing in the enthusiasm line shortly Sydney will
have undergone a change for the worse.

“The Bondman” continues to suffer to
great houses at Sydney Royal. There will be no
mitigation of his sorrows till business starts to
slacken in the Tents of Bland and that event
remains, so far, well below the dramatic horizon.

Those who like to take ‘ their pleasures
sadly, not to say weepfully, can find much pabu-
lum at Sydney Lyceum just now, where Spencer’s
machine whirls off the drippy story of Tolstoi’s
“Resurrection.” Then, to take the taste out of
the mouth, comes a sparkling comedy, acted by
splendid French artists, whose facial expressionsare
simply entrancing. The UncoGuid will find much
delectation in watching What Der-rink Did. Why
Mr. Spencer should seek to belie a useful beverage
in this shocking manner is hard to see. But for
real sensationalism the doings of the Anarchist’s
Daughter take all prizes. Mr. Spencer arranges
his programmes well, and his audience plunges
through sea and sky, and over the earth and the
remote places thereof, with fearful rapidity.

The brilliant J. B. Atholwood and the
rather vigorous Johnson Weir, two confessedly
able mummers, have been secured by Walter
Bentley for the tour that will presently start in
Brisbane. Rather of the novice order are
several of the women of the co. They in-
clude Miss Clay, Miss Patience Pope (late
in J.C.W’s. employ), and Miss Laing Meason
(who had a show in the recent Flemming-Day
co.), but they are of the spring lamb date
and have pretty looks and frocks. “ The Courier
of Lyons,” “The Bells,” and “David Garrick”
are included in a repertory that ought to exhilarate
tbe Mecca of the winter tourist. Julius Knight—
this item is dragged in apropos of nothing—was
once Walter Bentley’s leading man in older, colder
climes.

Alfred Woods (of the mighty smite and
mightier hair) and Miss Maud Williamson have
returned to Australia, after wandering in foreign
parts for the last seven years. The LTnited Sta tes,
Canada, Britain and Africa have all been visited,
and Alfred Woods holds the honor of being the
first Australian-born manager to range over four
continents. He has played seasons in both
London and New York, and in the former
capital produced Miss Williamson’s own
play, “The King’s Mistress,” with which
they afterwards toured the provinces as far
north as Aberdeen. The last two years
were spent touring Africa as far north as Beira,
in Portuguese East Africa, and thence to the Vic-
toria Falls, on the Zambesi River. The com-
pany’s last African appearance was in the historic
town of Barnum Powell—to wit, Mafeking. And
the sum-total of its impressions is that there is no
place like Australia. Mr. Woods is now arrang-
ing for an early appearance, when he will produce
some new plays acquired while abroad.

Next Wednesday “the Muffs” are to
gather themselves together at Sydney Royal
and do “Niobe”—the lady who cursed so freely
upon the housetop when tilings went wrong,with
her, and thus intruded the bad manners of ancient
Greece upon a conventional, frock-coated, top-
hatted London suburb. The entertainment will
also include the one-act play “A Martyr to Prin-
ciple,” by Miss Sumner Locke and Stanley McKay.
The profits go to St. Martha’s Industrial Home,
and the plan is at Elvy’s. The Bulletin has re-
ceived a list of the performers in which it thinks
it can make out a name here and there ; but they,
are so doubtful that it is safer to call them all
Smith.

Just at present Sydney Tivoli is keeping
the bill flying with four turns, and R. H. Douglass
—who supplies one of them—fades from view at
the end of the week. That will leave the Sprightly
Sisters, Kremka Brothers and Rosina Casselli’s
dogs to assist whatever reinforcements have been
ordered to the footlights. It is the nature of the
Tivoli to go back a bit after the departure of a
planet, star or other projectile; it suggests the
recoil of a field gun, and is apparently just as
unavoidable. The present combination is a fairly
entertaining one; nevertheless, there is a per-
ceptible lull, and the welcome furore is a scarce
animal.
** * *
The success of “The Merry Widow” re-
vival in Adelaide is largely the success of Florence
Young. She is really a joyous relict, which her
predecessor wasn’t. The staging in the little
Royal is necessarily far from being the staging
that Sydney and Melbourne saw ; but Adelaide is
mostly unaware of that, and therefore doesn’t
worry. The play itself is the same old muddle of
Parisian impropriety as they imagine it in
Vienna, filtered through an American medium,
which has left sticking to it bits such as
“ Hello, maiden ! ” (addressed to a strange
lady), and gems of humor about mother’s cook-
ing and its effect on the dog. (“Filtered” is
perhaps an unfortunate expression with regard to
the business of the summer-arbor, which retains
all impurities.) The co. has made a sudden
change to “The Dairymaids,” which is as aggres-
sively English as the other is foreign, though it is
helped out by a fine display of feminine muscle—
which is cosmopolitan. Cinquevalliisstillcrowding
the Tivoli; and he still risks his precious spine by
unnecessarily catching a cannon-ball on his neck.
The writer once asked him what would happen in
case of a slip. “ I should not be there,” he re-
marked simply. True, he wouldn’t. Yet even
Maclaren has been missing occasional catches in
the slips of late—and as he didn’t know he was
going to do it he was there.
SHAKSPEARE AT BRUNTON’S BENEFIT,
SYDNEY.
WALTER BENTLEY
as Richard III.
GEORGE RIGNOLD
as Marc Antony,
in a frock coat.
“The Flag Lieutenant,” very lately of
Sydney, began its Melbourne season at Her
Majesty’s last Saturday. The story of how
Major Thesiger, of the Marines, had glory thrust
upon him by his valorous, chivalrous and frivolous
friend Dick Lasoelles, was dealt with in these
columns only three weeks ago. This is not a story
to be dealt roughly with. Its warlike character is
full of feminine interest, and its improbabilities are
not irritating. All the men in the narrative, bar
one, are surrounded by the glamor of naval
apparel, and all the ladies move in the best society.
In the first act everybody’s breast is expanding
for a ball on Admiral Titheradge’s flagship. The
final scene shows the quarter-deck of the same
vessel, and the very last words that charm the
listening ear are uttered from the mouths of stage
cannon at the rear of the proceedings. The
trouble ends in smoke.
* » * *
The Angel of Death hovers persistently
over the second act, where a dozen men consti-
tute the British Camp at Candia, yet her presence
is not very gloomy ; the fatalities entail no
mourning. In connection with one of these
sudden deceases the hero, who is also the funny
man of the plot, positively ventures to “ pull the
leg” of his superior officer, and from this airy
persiflage arises much serious misunderstanding.
So “ The Flag Lieutenant ” may be described as a
picturesque comedy with a warning moral. Never
introduce jocularity into stern business. Tell lies
if you will with the full intention of sticking
to 'them; but avoid the quicksands of spoof
when there is any fear of your reputation
being swallowed up. The leg that Dick Lascelles
pulls so gaily gives him a nasty kick for his indis-
cretion. It biffs him right in his honor, and
nearly reduces him to the necessity of sacrificing
all his chivalry in order to clear himself. The
play preserves him from that calamity, of course,
because he has to remain always the hero with
limelight thick upon him; nevertheless, his
sportive fooling with the truth promises to bring
the grey hairs of his best friend in sorrow to the
grave. His best friend, Thesiger, can be happy
in his C.M.G.-ship for only just as long as he
retains his loss of memory. If his brains recover
their missing recollections he will want to blow
them out with a revolver. For he also is a self-
respecting citizen, unlike many other C.M.G.’s
who are under no delusion as to their fitness for
titular distinction.

Comedies of this class are pretty much
what the actors make them. “The Flag
Lieutenant” is not more than fairly convincing.
Kingston adapts himself cleverly to the gaudy
character of the hero--the humorous fellow who
cannot take himself seriously, seeing that ambition
is essentially snobbish in its self-conceit. But
Kingston fails to conceal the possibilities of effects
which he doesn’t attain. He is not naturally
handsome, dashing, debonair, brilliant and
boyish. He only acts at being a darling of the
gods —and the women. Also he is rather too tall for
his part, or Cyril Mackay is too short for his part.

Their alleged difference in height is not apparent.
Mackay is unduly heavy and melodramatic as
Major Thesiger, and neither he nor Kingston
seems to belong to the same set as Geo. Tither-
adge, whose Admiral is a most happy creation.
The new ladies, Miss Ethel Warwick and Miss
Dorothy Grimston, are pleasing in pleasing parts,
which offer abundant opportunity for more emo-
tional acting than they display ; the manner of
pretty Miss Elwyn Harvey is super-ingenuous ;
and Miss Emma Temple plays an elderly, smiling
eat with broad, polished art. Dion Titheradge is
quite at home in his midshipman’s rig, and
Gregan McMahon, as the young Irishman from
the cable station, gives a color of reality to the
denouement. McMahon blows into the naval
imbroglio like a breeze from off the shore, and is
exceedingly refreshing. A first matinee of “The
Flag Lieutenant ” will be given on Saturday,
instead of Wednesday, this week.

At the Royal the first change in the Asche-
Brayton bill is to happen on Saturday, and Mel-
bourne’s restored appetite for “ the legitimate’’ is
getting ravenous for the occasion. By that time
the Shrew will have had five weeks of Taming
during which period the reputation of the Shak-
spearian co. has become well established. In
changing from farcical comedy to tragedy, Oscar
Asche couldn’t have ventured a better tragedy
than “Othello.” It accentuates the wisdom of
the White Australia policy. Moreover, it will be
new to the present generation. The story of how
the jealous colored person suppressed his blonde
young wife with a bolster has been more honored
in the speech than in the performance for 20
years.

At Melbourne Princess’s, the interesting
incongruities of “The Fencing Master” can be
revealed for only a few more nights, inasmuch as
Hugh Ward and Co. will have to make way for
“The Flag Lieutenant” (transferred from Her
Majesty’s) on the 28th. And meanwhile “The
Man from Mexico ” is waiting on Ward’s mat.
'therefore anyone in search of dramatic curios had
better become acquainted with “The Fencing
Master ”as soon as possible. A special profes-
sional matinee of that sentimental extravaganza
in four acts was billed for this (Thursday) after-
noon, when Oscar Asche and Miss Brayton, as
guests of honor, will study its peculiarities from a
box. And, by the way, the Victorian
Artists’ bociety ought to be present. The life-
size portrait of Grace IFalotta is the most solid
work of art ever exhibited in this country. The
figure looks capable of stepping right out of the
frame, and would probably do so if pushed.
This is the third or fourth reappearance of
“The Face at the Window ” in Melbourne, and
its old admirers are more than ever impressed by
it. The piece is far too serious and intellectual
for thoughtless mirth. It is partly opium and
partly crayfish dream. There is the over-
whelming miscreant, Delgado, with his red-
lined cloak and grey hat. There is, fur-
ther, Paul Gouffet, detective, with the craggy,
philosophic brow and the concertina pants.
Couffet triumphs in their contests ; but Delgado
has all the advantage of the green limelight and
the vast and grisly silences. During those silent
periods one remarks nothing but the growing
greenishness of the green, and the disorderly gasps
of the audience. Then comes the howl, the pre-
cursor to that large, ghoulish visage from which
the play takes its name. The Face has changed
little with the years. It still maintains the old
pallor, significant of bloodlessness or corruption.
But the howl has become retrograde and has lost
its traditional terror. Its lupine ferocity and
eeriness of appeal are not what they were.
Roy Redgrave, who gets inside the Countenance,
is a realistic Italian. He speaks English
like a Swede (not the turnip of that name)
in old Madrid. His manner is appropri-
ately Mephistophelean throughout, and is highly
colored with cynicism and disconcerting noncha-
lance. Gouffet, as played by Harry Diver, is
studied and severe. His great quality is
dignity, and he uses it to present an official
who would think slang out of place, and
have a punster guillotined. Laurence Dunbar
has temporarily resigned the villain’s moustache
to become a mild and seraphic clerk. The comic
relief is Bailey rampant, while Duggan is the
electrician who makes the corpse sit up straight.
Stirling Whyte is the banker, corpsed by the Iron
Dagger of Le Loup ; while Temple Harrison and
Max Clifton are cut-throats who regard crime
with reprehensible levity. Miss Kate Gair is
rather lifeless, Miss Fanny Erris is an occasional
bit of punctuation, and Miss Kathleen Lorimer
raises her fragile voice as the faded-looking lady
who runs “ The Rogue’s Retreat.”

Amy Castles, whose name is an announce-
ment of her musical intentions, makes her first
reappearance at Melbourne Town Hall on Satur-
day, and will take the platform again three nights
next week. Her concert company this time
includes Anderson Nicol, of the tenor persuasion ;
Victor Busst, pianist; young Amadio, the flautist;
and Peter Dawson, a basso who went from South
Australia to Europe seven years ago. The fact
that his name is Dawson should be noted care-
fully. because a mayor, in welcoming Miss Castles
to Westralia the other day, commended her for
having brought a famous compatriot in Mr. Peter
Jackson.

Chung Ling Soo is still the ruling force of
attraction at Melbourne Opera House, but his
nights are numbered. Their exact number, how-
ever, is a secret known only to the management
and himself, and if The Bulletin 1 were to think
of a number, the bland wizard would turn it into
something different. The advt. is more definite
as to when the prolonged Meisters will depart.
They are going elsewhere this week, taking with
them the good wishes of all who witnessed their
one performance an indefinite number of times.
“O.K. The late John Brunton had not completed
his quarter of a century of good work in Australia. He was
brought from England by the original “ Firm ’’—William-
son, Garner and Musgrove—in 1885, if I remember rightly.
For some years he was the colleague of George Gordon,
and it was not until “the Firm ” relinquished the
management of Melbourne Royal that he began his long
association with Bland Holt. Gordon (senior) who died
long ago, found anew colleague in PhilGoatcher, and he,
with Spong (who painted for Brough and Boueicault)
made up a quartette of scenic artists whose names were
household words in the Australian theatrical world. It
is a fact easily explained that the men who make the
scenery get less honor in thiscountrv than of vore. Goat-
cher survives of the old brigade, and beautiful work has
been done in recent years by Coleman, Waite and others ;
but we take an artistic stage setting nowadays more as a'
matter of course than we did when the fine upstanding
Brunton was a new-chum in the land.
AT POVERTY POINT.
A sparkling extract from poor old London Paunch :
“ Intense interest is excited by the impending arrival of
Madame Blara Outt, a vocalist of such Patagonian pro-
portions that, in the words of Keats —-
‘ By her in stature the tall Amazon
Had stood a pigmy’s growth.’
Madame Outt, who is married to that extraordinarily
handsome and gifted tenor, Mr. Cummerley Bundford, is
the happy mother of a delightful little daughter, who is
humorously known in the profession as the ‘Outtlet.’”
If the autnor of “ An Englishman’s Home ” hadn’t been
the son of a Paunch artist (who supplied some humorous
legends to his own drawings in days of yore), he would
certainly have added to the satire of his play by repre-
senting Mr. Brown as the typical Englishman who sets
the tea table in a roar by reading funny things from
Paunch to his delighted family.
“ Harrison O.” : The volcanic Lola Montez has been
mentioned in “Poverty Point” pars., therefore a recent
book, “Lola Montez: An Adventuress of the ’Forties,”
by E. B. d’Auvergne, should be of interest to many.
Lola’s father was allegedly a captain in the British army.
His daughter made a runaway, marriage when she was 19
years young. After that her life was an adventurous one.
She went on the stage as a d,ancer, and, as such, w'as a
failure in London, Warsaw, Brussels and Paris. But her
beauty ensnared many men, including Franz Liszt and
Alexandre Dumas the elder. Later she became the
favorite odalisque of Louis 1., of Bavaria, who was then
61 years old, and for a time she had a big share in the
bossing of the kingdom. She was a great barracker for
the Yellow Pup, and let that animal loose in the country,
and sooled it on in a manner that caused the king’s
ministers to mutter the Bavarian equivalent tor
“Blariky” many times. When the fickle Louis com-
menced to tire of hishouri, his Ministers persuaded him to
shove her out of the capital. Her house was wrecked by a
mob, but she returned at night, disguised as a man,
and was shoved out some more. Finally, she was accused
of witchcraft and handed over to a professed exorcist,
from whom she escaped. It was in 1855, when she was
37 years old, that she arrived in this part of the globe.
She opened her season in Sydney with a four-act drama
founded upon her adventures in Bavaria. It was in a
later production that she introduced her notorious
“Spider Dance” to a shocked public. When she per-
formed this stunt in Melbourne a number of bald-headed
citizens cried out for its suppression in the interests of
public decency. Before leaving Sydney, Lola had a row
with a member of her company, a Mrs. Fiddes, who issued
a writ of attachment against her. Lola rushed to
the boat, went into her cabin, and —er—stripped.
When the sheriff, a worthy person of the name
of Brown (probably John), came on board to
arrest her, she sent up word that he was
at liberty to take her, but she felt it her
duty to inform him that she was naked. Brown
retired in confusion and in a hurry, and for many days
had to suffer the jeers of the populace. It was at Ballarat
that the famous horsewhipping episode occurred. One
Seekamp, editor of a paper there, spoke some truths con-
cerning her past life which annoyed the lady (though the
Lord knows why 1), so one day when he (Seekamp, not
the Lord) happened to call at the pub at which stie was
staying, she rushed off and, obtaining a riding- whip, laid
it across him with much vigor in the public room of the
hostel. That night at the theatre she received a great
reception, which induced her to makea'speech. Seekamp,
she said, had announced his intention of driving
her off the diggings, but she would turn the
tables and “ make Seekamp decamp.” Upon the
yarn that Lola was, in her turn, thrashed by
another person of her own sex, d’Auvergne turns
the cold eye of scorn. He condemns it as an Ananias
that was faked up by Seekamp, and expresses surprise
that so many writers should have accepted it as being
truthful. Once at a review given by Fred Bill of Prussia
in honor of Nick the First of Russia, the adventuress’s
horse took fright at the firing of the salutes. There was
danger of it rushing into the Royal party ; so a harmless,
necessary aide-de-camp, in a praiseworthy endeavor to
protect his boss, struck it with his whip so as to keep it
off. Lola chose to regard this as a deadly insult, and
slashed the unfortunate minion across the face. In
later life the fair virago became religious, and joined
the American Episcopal Church. For some time
before her death, in 1861, she lived what was almost a
monastic existence, and after her decease one Dr. Hawks,
her spiritual adviser, spoke highly of her virtues.
“H.”: There seems to be a terrible sameness about
these imported soubrette actresses. I dropped in
at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), the other night,
and would have sworn that Miss Lottie Sargent
was another elfin damsel named Thorne, who
figured in “Lady Madcap” with Gouriet, Reginald
Kenneth, and those people. Again, I found in Miss
Sargent strong- points of resemblance to Miss Fanny
Dango (the sister, I believe, of Lydia Flopp) in figure,
voice and dancing ; and have been wondering since
whether these ladies and 72 others graduated in the same
academy of theatrical instruction. They all seem
to run to a porcelain daintiness of figure,
are neat about the ankles, and possess not ex-
actly feet, but “tootsies.” The upper floors towards
tne root are what some males call “ enticing'.” The waist
can be strong-ly suspected of misplacement. A little
Higher there j s a burgeoning that avoids exuberance ;
and, sitting on a slender neck, is a melange of plait or
pigtail, two cheeky orbs, and a dental exhibition like a
graveyard by moonlight. But the most singular thing
about them all is their similarity in noise production,
their voices appear to be rather chirrupy in texture, with
a little super-alto screech tucked away among the attic
notes. Only occasionally—as in their songs—will you
hear that little screech ; and as an effort in voice eleva-
tion it strikes me as akin to a feat in ballooning or
mountaineering. As for their graceful dancing, it seems
just as curiously same ; indeed, there is less sameness
about a row of policemen’s feet or an avenue of lamp-
posts than about those pleasant imported soubrettes.
“ Melb.”: Here is one of our choicest bits of Bumble- *
dom. Everyone knows that the exits of the Bijou
Theatre are not too good. Good enough, maybe, but not
too good, the place being all upstairs. It looks incred-
ible, but I can testify, from personal observation, that it
is the regular Sunday-night practice to keep closed the
principal exit from stalls and dress circle—-that is to say,
along the saloon passage, and down the broad stairs into
Bourke-street. On Sundays the theatre is occupied
b.v the Socialists, always with large houses, and the
place is extra-crowded when the living pictures
are shown. A spice of danger from fire attaches
to the biograph, more or less. The stalls and
dress-circle are sure to be pretty full, whatever is on,
for the cheap Sunday show. Yet these people are barred
off from their chief exit. They have to go down a crooked
staircase into the Arcade. The Gaiety Theatre, under
the same roof, is always occupied on Sunday nights, with
the Arcade as the exit. Imagine a fire ! A mob from
dress-circle and stalls in the Bijou rushes ‘through the
saloon, and downstairs, to find the street door locked !
Firemen would have to hew it open with axes. The whole
thing looks as if designed to cremate and spifflicate the
Melbourne Socialists at one fell pop.
“Vulcan”: Melba, according to a London paper,has had
to register her professional trade mark in the United States.
The yarn goes thus: A New York chemist’s gorgeous display
of the “new Melba perfume” caught the singer’s eye
and she proceeded to investigate. She smelt the perfume
and didn’t think much of it, and she asked the minion in
her best outraged manner how he dared borrow her name.
The defendant emerged from the haze after she’d finished,
and said coolly : “ My name’s Blank ; yours is Armstrong.
I have as much right to ‘ Melba ’as you.” When a faint-
ing song bird reached her motor, the sparks rained as she
fled furiously to the proper office to register herself before
someone got ahead of her and copyrighted “Melba” as
the name of a new sausage or a dog-soap.
Theatrical manager Bill Anderson has intimated to a
London paper that he proposes to become a much more
extensive manager in the future. He alleges that he is
buying up the Australian rights of the best dramas going,
and is arranging the engagement of artists of great
tonnage and calibre. Moreover, he is recruiting a musi-
cal comedy company, and will also pack up a complete
pantomime production for a Christmas attraction. That
is probably the full record of William’s enterprises to
date ; but he may also bring out a Shakspearian com-
pany, a flicker show and a circus.
Bernard Shaw, who has just had another play (the
second within six weeks) prohibited by the censor, scores
neatly by remarking that Beerbohm Tree, who “ was
found guilty of attempted blasphemy,” inasmuch as he
-sought permission to produce the former piece, has actu-
ally been knighted in the interval. “It only remains for
the King to make me a duke to complete the situation.”
The new piece, “Press Cuttings,” contains a Premier
Balsquith and a General Mitchener, and is barred under
the rule against “ personalities, expressed or understood.”
“As to the latter,” says Shaw, “ I can say nothing, for
the Lord Chamberlain’s understanding is a thing totally
beyond comprehension, or even conjecture ” ; while, as to
direct personalities, G.B.S. remarks that he has himself
been caricatured on the stage so closely that a near rela-
tive of his thought it was the real St. Bernard, and not a
counterfeit imitation.
“ 0.K.” : Seems to me that the possibilities of Jo Smith,
as an Australian dramatist, have been considerably under-
rated, owing to the mistaken idea that he Was a mummer
who had taken some bits of old material from his stock
of recollections, and built a play with them. “ A Miner’s
Trust ” has rather the appearance of being the composi-
tion of an actor than the original work of an inexperi-
enced writer. But Jo Smith is an amateur dramatist
rather than an old actor. He was a “pro” forfour or
five years when he was a very young man—little more
than a stage-struck youth. He played small parts in
Charles Holloway’s co. and with the Janet Achurch co. on
tour. His brief experience of the boards convinced him
that he could do better with his brains in a non-theatrical
line of business. To-day he is a well-to-do man of 40 in the
furniture trade, who “scribbles” for mental recreation,
and is wisely trying to make the most of his literary
ability by turning it to play-writing, where his old-time
studies in stage-craft are a valuable asset. His next drama,
which will shortly come along at Anderson’s theatre in
Melbourne, is understood to be a story of up-country life
without any “squattah” in it. Jo Smith is Australian
by birth—a native of Melbourne.
Claude Leplastrier, artist and Australian, is doing well
with the “Scarlet Troubadour ” Co. in M.L. He light-
ning-sketches in the face of the multitude, and causes it
vast puzzlement by his skill. Curious how the multitude
loves to be puzzled : for proof consider the unflagging
interest it takes in conjurers, illusionists, lightning
sketchers, J. Cook, and other quick-change artists and
contortion experts.
“Vulcan”: Rbjane, France’s famous actress, has re-
married her husband, Porel, from whom she was recently
divorced. Porel used to stage-manage for the star, with
gratifying results to both! They weren’t doing well
financially, apart, and so like sensible folk they came
together again. Business covers a multitude of marital
trouble and so forth in Paris.
Australia's old friend, Nance O’Neil, has shot like a
meteor into stardom in Noo Yark under the management
of Shubert. In this instance, however, it is the play that
is the thing and not the actress. The drama staggers
under the commonplace term of “Agnes,” but the
strength and novelty of its plot have brought it right to
the front, carrying big, bouncing Nance along with it.
The story is really another version of Enoch Arden.
Agnes, goaded by an ambitious mother, jilts her lover, a
medical student, and hitches herself to the aged
millionaire whom she doesn’t love. He goes for a
trip and is supposed to be lost in a wreck;
so Agnes marries the man of her heart. All
this is crammed into the rather feeble first act, but
then the play gets on to its legs and moves with a venge-
ance. The new husband becomes a famous surgeon, and
one day a man comes to be treated. Agnes recognises in
him her first husband, who it appears has been for years
on a desert island, as the result of which his mind has
become a blank. Agnes entreats her lover not to perform
the operation that will restore her first husband’s
memory; but in a strong scene the surgeon refuses, and
Agnes is left to beat frantically at the door of the room
in which the operation is being performed. This is
where Nance, the heavyweight, gets in most of her deadly
work. She is a great door-pounder, and her flogging of
the portal has swept Noo Yark off its feet. In the last
act the wife at length confronts the surgeon. “Does he
know what he was before?” she gasps. There is a tense
pause. Then the surgeon says: “He didn’t live long
enough. Agnes, this is my first failure.”
There is a fine part waiting for Julius Knight. “ Henry
of Navarre,” played in London by Fred Terry and Julia
Neilson (who is Mrs. Terry), is now out in the form of a
novel, written by May Wynne. (The play is by William
Devereux, an American.) The lady strikes a bold blow
for historical accuracy by giving Navarre his real age,
which was only 19 at the time of the St. Bartholomew
massacre, though the hero is the usual swaggering,
mature and infinitely cunning ideal of the modern Yankee
writer. It must have pained Miss Wynne to have to de-
. scribe Navarre as being in Paris on Bartholomew’s Eve,
and actually fighting a duel with the Due de Guise
in the king’s presence while other Huguenots were being
massacred outside ; but there wouldn’t be any play—or,
consequently, any novel —otherwise. The great scene is
where Margaret, the king’s sister and Navarre’s bride,
has made a compromising appointment with de Guise—she
being the usual innocent-idiot wife of drama. She re-
pents it at once, but he comes, with the furious and sus-
picious king on his track. Enter a masked man, who
helps Guise to escape and then hides himself, to be
dragged out soon after by the royal guards. “Death of
the devils ! Who are you and what are you doing here ?”
He is unmasked. It is Navarre, of course. “Morbleu,
sire ! Where should a man be but in his wife's rooms?”
Can’t you hear J. Knight drawling it?
Queenie Burrowes, a Ballarat girl, has joined the com-
pany of Julius Superfluous, and has been playing Poppaea
in “ The Sign of the Cross ”at Brisbane. Ballarat has for
a good few years been proud of its Queenie, who,has been
able to turn her hand or tongue or toe to almost anything
in the local entertainment line ; and now that siie has
gone into the professional business for keeps, the golden
township lavs some of the blame on The Bulletin,
which once encouraged her by telling her that she was
the principal performer at a St. Pat’s concert in Mel-
bourne. and had “a melodious voice and an Etna of
dramatic fire.”
“S.S. : ” Melbourne audiences can’t get on to the social
status of the chief characters in Hugh Ward’s comedy
“ The Fencing Master.” We are led to believethat the
expatriated Dago, Angelo Rossi, is an impoverished
nobleman who is living in haughty indigence in poor
rooms over a free and easy foreign restaurant in New
York; but the play opens in a very decently-appointed
dining room, with several waiters in approved garments.
All Angelo’s guests are in excellent evening dress. One
is a rich widow ; another a successful lawyer. The son, on
whose art education the fallen Roman is squandering all
his hard-earned cents, is dressed for dinner with the
elaboration of a tailor’s dummy. His evening suits looks
as if it had been built by an undertaker, so black is it, so
rigid in its outlines, so deadly respectable. Presently to
the same room come the Hon. Stewart Gravville, Mrs.
Montgomery, and Miss Montgomery, abominably fas-
tidious, fearfully rich, and socially exalted. After peering
about through a lorgnette, Mrs. Montgomery explains
that her party is slumming.
“ Burbage” : In the Melbourne Oyclorama last Sunday
night, with 3000 people all gazing on the living picture
show, I had a vivid imagination of being in Shakspeare’s
Globe Theatre, London. The Globe, in its shell, must
have been extremely like this Cvclorama building, and
about the same size. It was octagonal outside; and circu-
lar inside. Shakspeare’s Globe was burnt in 1613, when
he had apparently cleared out of the business, for he gave
up his London home about 1608. Yet it is supposed that
a huge mass of documents relating t.o him was destroyed
at the Globe. That theatre had three galleries. These
formed the cheapest part of the house. The top one was
thatched over. The fire occurred at the first performance
of “ Henry VIII.,” and was caused by some burning- wad-
ding from a cannon lodging in the thatch. No lives were
lost. The pit was for the middle class ; swells had boxes
under the first gallery. Aristocrats sat on the stage.
There were no painted scenes apparently—-just a board
announcing that this was supposed to be a forest or a
palace or a blasted heath or heaven or any old place like
that.
“Melb.”: “ Othello” is the next Oscar Asche produc-
tion. His study is barbaric, like Salvini’s, with a genuine
Moorish make-up, somewhat on the lines of the American
M’Cullough. Wilson Barrett last acted Othello here. In
Sydney Rignold’s will be remembered, with Diver's most
.excellent lago. Edmund Kean appears to have been the
first outstanding Othello, although he came two centuries
after Shakspeare. Kemble, Macready and Phelps were
comparatively indifferent in it. Then Brooke made this
his greatest part, and Edwin Forrest shone therein also.
These two- warm friends were singularly alike. Immense
was the sensation made by Brooke’s Othello in London.
He opened in Melbourne with it. His lago was also
remarkably fine. Othe^great ones were Edmund Kean,
Macready and Sullivan. Salvini’s Othello is mentioned
with those Of Kean and Brooke. Feehter failed in the
part, but took lago well, as likewise did Dillon. When
Irving and Booth acted together in London both failed as
Othello, and succeeded as lago. It is alleged that Rig-
nold’s mother, a capital Hamlet and Romeo, likewise
acted lago.
“Zed” (from Wellington, M.L.): Pollard’s Juvadult
opera co. was blown into Wellington from. the extreme
back blocks by a vagrant north-wester -the other day,,
and cheered up (in moderation) the place with Lecocq’s
35-year-old “ Manola.” The production had an anti-
quarian interest only ; it was the poorest of a hunch of
operas introduced to Melbourne by A. T. Dunning in
1882. In partnership with one Walter Reynolds, Dunning
had been operating in Maoriland, butaftef adplitDunning
went to Europe and mopped up the down-South rights
of “Rip Van Winkle,” “ Boccacio,” “Les Manteaux
Noirs,” “The King’s Dragoons,” and, last and least,
“Manola.” At the same time he engaged a company,
which included such excellent warblers and mummers
as Miss Annette Ivanova, Kate Chard, Agnes Consuelo,
the Martin Sisters, T. B. Appleby, Knight Aston, George
Dean and others. “Manola” is thin wine, which has
gone flat and stale, and only throws up a bead of melody
here and there. In fact, you would hardly know it was
comic opera if it wasn’t for the pained expression of the
man whose business it is to be kicked by everyone else in
the cast.
A CHAMPION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
An enterprising- woman, named Hoiker, has started a
school in Budapest, where pupils of all ages are given a
full course of instruction in the art of eating.
Examinations are to be held at the end of each term,
when the students will be requested to attack an array of
unknown delicacies set before them. Those who undergo
the ordeal successfully will obtain a certificate from Frau
Hoiker which will enable them to face any banquet with-
out flinching.— News item,.
As a pale youth, I thrilled with joy sublime,
To think some day my humble name might ring
Upon men s tongues ; and down the aisles of time,
With roar reverberant go echoing.
I sought for fame as very few men seek ;
My soul became a furnace of desire
That burnt life’s tissue up ; grey grew my cheek,
And flabby as a punctured cycle tyre.
Me from my purpose nothing could deflect ;
Knocked down I snarled, and straightway rose again,
To match the might of my rare intellect,
In life’s arena with my fellow men.
I mewed the woose—l mean I wooed the Muse.
I wrote rich reams of rarely ringing verse.
For gold? Ah, no ! My meed was vile abuse !
The door for me —the outward thrust —the curse 1
I turned my back on loud Melpomone,
Erato, Polyhymnia and that crowd,
For good and all. The footlights beckoned me ;
And I’d have acted—had I been allowed !
Being by nature gifted with a voice,
I sought the classic concert hall to grace.
Alas ! while bidding “ weary hearts rejoice,”
A vagrom egg collided with my face !
But why prolong the story of these years
Of early struggles? That I was no fool
I since have proved. I said good-bye to tears
When I was told about the Eating School 1
On my first day I won the learners’ prize,
And left no room for subsequent debate
As to my powers of shifting food supplies ;
“ Eclipse was first, the others also ate ! ”
In six short months I ate my way to fame :
To-day I’m starred by Tickards at the “Riv.,”
The “ Ten-Stun Wonder ” is my programme name,
And breathless thousands watch the shows I give.

IN THE NAME OF ART: AN APPEAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
A number of new and important regulations have been
made in terms of “The Prisons Act, 1899.” It has been
decided to abolish the old time gaol marks and garb.
The broad arrow will disappear from prisoners’ clothes. —
News Item.
The Arrow doomed ! The symbol, sign, or mark
That’s served so oft upon the stage to send
Such pleasing- thrills through us of boding dark—
It looks like the beginning of the end.
The Blood Play will not be a Play of Blood
Lacking that scene wherein the hero moils
In pied khaki, spurred onward by a flood
Of oaths from one who holds him in his toils.
(A knave this last that shames the name of Law
In dark-blue uniform and tram-guard’s cap :
He’s raged in almost ev’ry play I saw
These years past. Programmes know him as “The
Trap.”)
How dull will be the convict’s “ Break from Gaol ”
When it is made in normal clothes ! How flat 1
(Crime’s old-time livery grew never stale ;
Its lurid hue and markings saw to that.)
Picture the strain that needs must be imposed
On our credulity what time the Flight,
With armtid warders in pursuit’s, disclosed
Along the railway line at dead of night.
The Capture in the lonely rural barn
Won’t “go ” an atom—that’s my prophecy—
It will not make folks shudder worth a darn,
Or wring a tear from one onlooking eye.
List, Mr. Wade, to this, the warm request
Of one to whom the Play of Gore is dear :
Shut down on forgers, stabbers and the rest:
Jump, if you will, on Female Swindlers'; clear
The State of thieves, thugs, drunks—we shall not grieve ;
Nay, more ! the most of us won’t even care—
So that Crime’s fancy-dress you only leave.
It is a “ prop ” the drama cannot spare.

PENFOLD'S
WINES
Judge Murray, of N.S.W., lias taken to
denouncing the Australian liquor-drinkir.g habit
from the Bench. When a Judge feels the desire
for iidvt. or for mere facial exercise strong upon
him, he generally denounces something from the
Bench, and poor
olej Drink is always
handy. Yet the
Judge, in many
cases, knows very
little about his sub-
ject, and he can’t
imagine that his
vigorous remarks
will cause one pint
the less to he con-
sumed in all Aus-
tralia. Likewise it
occasionally hap-
pens that his
Honor’s elocution
is so painful that
silence or extreme
brevity, not need-
h ss outpourings re
Drink or anything
else, should be his
strong suit. Fur-
thermore he isn’t
paid to discourse
<>n Drink, and so
he is wasting his
employer’s time.
Likewise he should
remember that the
lawyer’s remuner-
ation and the bill
for wear and tear
of the Court are
running on all the
while, and the
prisoner is wait-’
ing to start his
sentence —a swift prisoner could got half-through
even a fairly long sentence in the time that a slow
Judge will waste making a few halting'remarks
re wet substances in bottles. And the thing is a
misery to those Court functionaries who have to
he always there, and who have heard his Honor’s
few remarks, so often already. For his Honor's
few remarks have mostly a tendency to he the
same remarks that he made last time he remarked.

“D.”: Another outburst of the Chap-
zander madness has just passed over Melbourne,
and the two Yankee salvation peddlers marched
out as the central figures of a street procession
that suggested a partnership between Wirths’
circus and Booth’s hallelujah army. Alexander,
whose barren head is quaintly suggestive of a
peanut, and Chapman, looking like a ham-fat
actor in prosperous circumstances, were the central
features of the procession, and usurped the glory
that belonged rightly to the elephant and the
sore-eyed lion. They were followed by a long
line of saved sinners—linked misery long drawn
out. These were the captives at Chapman’s
chariot wheels. A profusion of joyous maidens
whose joyousness was strained and stark, like that
of the "happy villagers in the fourpenny melo-
drama, danced along the line of march and clapped
hands in gratitude for the half pint of pure salva-
tion measured out to each by the rnissioners. The
farewelling would have been theatrical and trump-
ery even if it had been vigorously worked up ; but
Melbourne was moist and cold and muddy that
day, and the whole show was like unto a penny
squib trying to assert itself in a puddle.
About the running of a city :
A city council, nowadays, isn’t the same old council that
used to make a road and a gutter and then reckon that
its job was done. In fact, though the City Council of
Sydney hasn’t got power over a quarter the area that it
should have, and doesn’t control half the things it should,
one doesn’t realise how many irons it even now has in the
fire until one noses into the accounts and sees where the
money goes. The ordinary city rates last year brought
in £190,949 ; but, leaving out the electric-light business
altogether, that wasn’t much more than half enough to
keep the business going. The balance came from all
sorts of things—rents of markets, and Town Hall,
and organ ; from baths, and licenses, and “con-
veniences”; from sales of sand and manure —the
Council turns an honest penny in a hundred ways.
The markets andsaleyards and electric-lighting revenues
are kept separate ; all the rest are bundled into the city
fund, out of which £317,740 was paid in the 12 months.
Street-making and gutter-digging are such comparatively
small potatoes that the total spent under the heading
“Streets” was only £73,219, or less than one-fourth of
the lot ; and that includes lighting, which alone ran into
over £20,000. It costs less to maintain the roadways and
the footpaths than it does to pay the scavenger. A few of
the other things pay, but most of them don’t, and are
never expected to. The organ cost £1343, including £6OO
for the year’s interest, and it brought in £382. At the
three baths the council gathered in £1339 ; the expenses,
without counting interest, were £1350. The best paying
asset of the lot is the cattle salevard ; it brought in
£13,007, and over £10,500 of that was profit. Both the
old and the new markets that stand in front of the
Owe’Sullivan’s railway station are profitable ; still they
are in the wrong place, and the cabbage and the old clo’
will have to shift themselves shortly. They left the city
£5109 to the good last year; while the Queen Victoria
Markets, the huge pile that feels like a vault when you
get inside it, left it £8658 to the bad. The rents of the
sepulchre only come to £16,339, and the interest hill on
the tomb (with a trifle for sinking fund) was £18,470.
One way and another the council has borrowed£2,los,ooo
from the public and £121,408 from the banks ; but what
with its sinking funds and its electric light and other
credit balances the net debt of the village is £1,906,107.
Still you can say this for the council which you can’t, for
the State: It has scarcely one loan without a sinking
fund hanging to its whiskers and slowly dragging it out
of existence.

Adelaide has a quaint taste in memorials.
Marryatville, one of its suburbs, has planted an
oak tree to mark the spot where Constable Hyde
was shot dead on January 2of this year. The in-
scription carries down to posterity the excited
statement that the deed was done by “ highway-
men.” As a matter of fact, the constable saw
three men loitering in the shadow of a hotel.
They were wearing long overcoats on the hottest
night of the summer, and as that seemed curious
he accosted them. They moved away. He fol-
lowed. They shot him dead, shed the coats, and
fled into the city, no trace of their identity hav-
ing ever been gained. (The coats proved useless
its a clue.) Th°y were very likely intending
thieves, and one of them was a murderer ; but
to talk of “highwaymen” in suburban Adelaide
sounds as though Marryatville draws its inspira-
tion from Dreadnought Dick.
ONLY FAIR!
“ No , sir. I refuse to allow you to marry my

“ Double Entry ” writes :
Accountants in Australia have ar, present no definite
legal status. Anyone can call himself an accountant,
and no one caw say who isn’t an auditor. There are
several institutes of accountants, and some States have
three or four. Just now there is much tribulation in the
profession over the action of the top-notchers, or rather
some persons who profess to top-notch. They have
combined throughout Australia as the Australian Corpora-
tion of Accountants, and various weight} 7 potentates of
the order are in London seeking a charter from the
Colonial Office. The professed object of the movement is
to create a body whose members will be really Australian
accountants, qualified to practise in every State.; but this
seems to he mostly bosh—also rats. There is absolutely
no need to go to Englaud in order to create such a body.
The explanation seems to he that accountants are largely
snobs, and are largely employed doing work for snobs.
Now the true Australian snob always has a profound
reverence for everything English, and the members
of the English gang of accountants in Australia
will thus probably get a pull over accountants
who are only members of some Australian body.
And by making all manner of cast-iron rules re-
garding new members it shouid be possible to prevent
too many new men coming into the profitable pasture of
the crowd of nominally-English accountants in Australia
who look after the accountancy work of local snobs. But.
it will be awkward if, some day when the Fusion is dead
and buried, a Democratic Federal Parliament establishes
a standard of qualifications and an examining body for
the admission of accountants, and declares that the
possession of the Federal certificate shall be the one and
only evidence of capacity, and refuses to take any more
notice of the proposed English charter than of a bubonic
rat.
“ 0.K.,” from Melbourne :
The trouble about Kenney’s baths at St. Kilda (Melb.)
revives a number of reminiscences of the time, away back
in 1854, when the original Captain Kenney beached his
ancient, Nancy brig at Sr,. Kilda, sawed a piece out of its
side and consecrated it to bathing purposes. The Nancy
was a two-master of Norwegian build, and had seen
nearlv 50 years’ service before it came to grief on the Mel-
bourne coast and was stranded as aforesaid. There are
people still living at St. Kilda who used to push through
the bush to get to Kenney’s bathing-ship, which now
faces the starting point of St. Kilda Esplanade. The old
Prince’s Bridge across the Yarrapointed the main road to
St. Kilda ; broad Fitzroy-street, almost at right singles to
the terminus of St. Kilda-road, led straight to Kenney’s
bathing-ship and then turned sharp to the left, forming
ttie Esplanade. But the ship in the first place had
been located some distance southward of its subse-
quent abiding place. Captain Kenney had not long been
in business when he was ordered by Melb. City
Council to shift his craft, on the understanding that
all the beach thereabouts would be reserved for women’s
baths, whilst the men would have t,o go northward in the
direction of Sandridge—or Port Melbourne as it is now
called. So Kenney had his old Nancy removed—an
expensive job—to the appointed spot, and immediately
obtained a site for ladies’ baths near the one he had
just vacated. Presently it appeared that Town-Clerk
Fitz Gibbon and others meant to cut into the business.
Fitz started a Sea Bathing Co., which proposed to fix up
baths for men at the spot from which Kenney had been
removed. The old marinerprotested against this scheme,
and stopped it; hut 18 months later the company got a
license to make a bathing enclosure for men on that very
site. Moreover, Kenney was always refused permission to
extend his baths out to’sea, whereas the other people got
every concession they applied for. The old sea-captain,
now deceased, had any amount of pluck and energy in
his earlier days. He built baths at other places than St.
Kilda; but the powers that be invariably “queered his
pitch ”_to use a theatrical expression—when opportunity
offered. Some 12 or 15 years ago'he published a pamphlet
detailing the shabby treatment he had experienced. His
son, the successor to the business, has a new cause for
complaint, a cause which is getting the sympathy of the
public, because they are partners in the grievance.
The principle of White Australia received
further advertisement when Duleie Ford appeared
in a Melbourne court the other day. Duleie, a
nice-looking girl of 19 years, was charged with
insufficient lawful means of support, and
a relentless Court pushed her history into
the glare of day. She, it appeared, had long
been an abandoned young person, resisting all
feeble attempts at reclamation. One of her
first consorts had been a brown personage,
and another was a yellow gentleman answering to
the call of Something Ah Fob. This little; Chow
the romantic Duleie produced as her “lawful
means of support,” and the mandarin himself
corroborated the statement. She had become his
“housekeeper” at a weekly salary of 30s. ; so
the Court had nothing to do but pass Duleie back
to her Mongolian. It is painful to think that
there are young women like Duleie, and more
painful to know that the law remains powerless to
suppress her colored affaires.
“ The Heathen ” : The Anglican Diocesan
Synod lately invited the members of Melbourne
Trades Hall Council by circular to attend a special
series of Sunday evening- services at St. Paul’s,
and listen reverently to addresses on “Aspects of
Christian Citizenship.” The following heated re-
marks from the Church of England Messenger
indicate the distressing result of the invitation,
and how the scheme for the proper instruction of
the workers fell through with a crash :
The unfriendly attitude of the Trades Hall Council to-
wards the proposed sermons at the Cathedral on social
subjects is both regrettable and natural. It is natural
because we are only too well acquainted with their igno-
rance of the church’s real attitude and province ; it is re-
grettable because we cannot hope to dispel that ignorance
until we can induce them to give us a hearing. Their
claim that Labor representatives should be amongst the
preachers of course shows that they do not understand
what a sermon is, or what the Cathedral is for. That we
should degrade our services to the level of a pleasant
Sunday afternoon is unthinkable.
There isn’t much meekness or humility in these
sentiments, and the quantity of brotherly love is
strictly limited. It. is a rather violent reminder
that the Church of to-day is a very different
Church from that founded by the Carpenter,
assisted by a few fishermen and men of lowly
birth- In its first stage the Church was wholly
Labor. Capital took no official notice of it until .
it began to spread among the workers ; and when
it did take notice it was with the idea of suppres-
sing it. But the thing survived, and persecution
only served to make it flourish. In the fulness of
time it became so big that the rich man came and
took the front seat, and at last the preachers lost
sight of the poor man at the back. In return for
the rich man’s regular payment of its
stipend, the Church has adopted his point of
view, and the camel-needle remark is not
stressed unduly, but delivered in a soft tone
with qualifications. Now and again the Church
is troubled, in its conscience about the benighted
working classes, and, reaching out in a half-hearted
way, tries to bring them back to furnish the vacant
pews. But it is firm on the point that the class
from which the institution originally rose must
submit to the doctrines laid down by the paid
priests of the rich man.' The tone of the Church
towards the worker is arrogant—even’ whilst it is
inviting him to come back to the fold and the
collection-plate. It is plainly eager for his atten-
tion- and his money ; but, in return, it will not
let him raise his voice. -He must pay to be
preached at on social subjects, and his ignorance
(“ with which we are only too well acquainted ’)
may be aired elsewhere ; but only after the rich
man’s religious servants have interpreted the
Scriptures to him according to the ideas of their
masters. After this, clergymen surely will not
waste time asking why men don’t go to church.
Would anything go to church under the circum-
stances?
THE FOUNDLINGS’ HOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Coroner Cole, after holding inquests on the bodies of
three infants thrown out in Melbourne recently, declared
that Victoria was rapidly approaching the condition that
existed in the worst days of the Roman Empire, when in-
fanticide was so common as to be almost disregarded. To
the plea for foundling homes, the Church and the virtuous
laity reply that such institutions tend to encourage im-
morality, and are not to be thought of.
The weird procession marches by,
The pale, dead babies in a row ;
And through the winter dark they go,
Adrift beneath the frowning sky.
An awful thing for man to see.
This march of dead humanity !
From some drips down the Yarra ooze,
The cold blood hangs on little lips,
Or there the sluggish poison drips,
That still the maddened mother brews.
Starvation sapped the rest. Alas !
Like small old haggard men they pass.
Oh, pious fools 1 these murdered oties,
So small and cold and ghostly white
And sightless, passing in the night,
They are your sin that naked runs—
A sacrifice to righteousness,
But dreadful infamy no less !
’Tis you will make them things of shame ;
Ygu set within the mother’s hand
The cord and dagger. Understand
For the cant phrases that ye frame
The children die. Infanticide
Is of Morality the bride.
Yet have you built for these a home—
The dead may have asylum, friends —
And here the babes’ long night march ends.
Stone walls it has, likewise a dome.
The stranger conies to grow our corn,
The Morgue receives the native-born.
VICTORIA.

THE BADLUCI
BALLET
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
r Bad I.uck Ballet Annie led—
That was eleven years ago —
And all the wise old actors said
No good luck could she ever know,
And Annie thinks she's found it so.
Ydimg Brown, who loved her very mzich,
Before their wedding day ca7ne round,
In tropic climate joined the Dutch ;
He fled to dodge the law. They found
His cash was short two thousand pound.
Will Smith , who zvas devoted too ,
And lavish as a prince might be ,
Blew off his head one day at Kew.
Of all his old man's fortune he
Left just the undertaker s fee.
Another ran to Yucatan:
In gaol two pass the time away ;
One drives a cab. “ Poor chaps," says Ann
“My bad luck beats them all!" To-day
Dear Annie's fairly rich, they say.

Here’s an Improvement in
Your Week-End Sweater.
A very popular style that buttons in front like a
vest. It is cooler than the average sweater,
and consequently makes fine wear for all sporting
purposes during summer. We can supply it in
several colors—White, Silver Grey, Brown and
Navy ; the material is well-knitted pure wool, and
the garment can be worn as a vest if desired in cool
weather. Specially recommended to golf, bowls,
tennis, and motoring enthusiasts as a garment
costing no more than the old style sweater.

“MEN’S OUTFITTERS,”
GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY.
The trouble arose through Smith, of Mel-
bourne, writing to Brown, in Hobart (Tas.), say-
ing that his friend Jones was ill and hard-up, and
would like a fiver to be sent to him at the G.P.0.,
Melbourne. Brown forwarded the money ; but,
instead of sending it to the G.P.0., where Smith
could go and collect it, he posted it to the Police
Commissioner, and notified Jones to go and get
it. That, of course, upset the whole scheme, and
Smith was bowled out. At his trial he pleaded
that the offence, if it were an offence, was really

sided there and it was Tasmanian money that he
would have got, supposing he had got it, which he
hadn’t. Justice Cussen, being a lawyer, perceived
that there was here a “nice point’’and matter
for much argument; which argument the Vic-
torian Full Court has just listened to for many
hours. Then it decided, though with some re-
luctance, that there wasn’t any point at all, and
that Smith had committed the offence where he

12 months.
PEAGRIM'S PROGRESS.
MR. PEAGRIM: “ Goin’ t' take decrees, are yeh? Now , that's curious; that's 'ow teamin' come t ’
me—by decrees. When I was young I was hutterly hiynorant, and now I’m a halderman.”
Victoria’s Police Commissioner O’Callaghan
—the gentleman who is on his last legs—has
isssued instructions that for the present only
“official” information as to cases of assault and
robbery in the city is to be given to the press ;
whereupon Melbourne Age obtrusively invites its
readers to send in particulars themselves. The
Age knows well enough that its pet ’tecs will
supply all the information, with trimmings, in
return for an occasional reference to Somebody’s
“ smart capture ” ; but in view of the Commis-
sioner’s instructions, everybody has to pretend
that the information comes from other sources.
And that no doubt explains the obtrusive invita-
tion to the public ; it will be something handy for
Detective XXY to hide behind in case the Com-
missioner asks him any awkward questions.
A Chicago firm which has
secured large contracts for the beef
supply of J. Bull’s army is one of
those which Upton Sinclair accused
of letting portions of any mangled
workman that got into the meat just
stay there. When Bull goes forth to
war with heavy odds in front, and a
cart of dubious beef behind, and a
horrible suspicion in his stomach, he
will indeed feel that things are going
hard with him.

“ Gelb ” : One result of the
long run of good seasons in South
Aus. is the scarcity of houses in and
around Adelaide, and the bloated
rents thereof. Numbers of farmers
have sold out or transferred their soil
to their sons, and have come to the
city to live in ease and motor-cars.
Their first move is to interview the
house-agent. The rent-paying Holy
Citizen takes the second move—with
his family, into a boarding-house or
culvert. Despite the fact that the
owners of houses open their mouths
like yawning chasms in regard to
rent, a one-inch advt. brings a wild
rush of the homeless. Before the
agent arrives at his office there is a
distracted-looking rabble at his door,
like the early-door collection of a
popular squealodrammer. They surge
into his office and butt against each
other furiously for the right to inhabit
the suburban villa. Once I remember
the land-agent as a servile insect who
dusted a chairfor you and said “ Yes,
sir,” with wearisome frequency; but
he now regards the house-seeker with
insufferable disdain, and neglects to
indicate that there is a chair on the
premises.
“ Horse Marine ” writes :
The courtesies extended by king's and their widows to
foreign rulers who happen to be relations or friends
should be strictly limited to the conferring of orders,
garters, stays, hair-pads, and other feminine furnishings
and upholstery. Victoria of England made Wilhelm of
Germany a British Admiral—or,'rather, she gave him per-
mission to wear a British Admiral’s clothes; conse-
quently, Wilhelm now has the right to range alongside
the latest Dreadnought and be shown with much respect
all over the fighting machine which has been specially
designed to keep him from invading England and extort-
ing tribute from the people who paid Albert’s widow’s
salary. Probably Victoria merely intended the privilege
to be a compliment: and even Wilhelm, in days gone bv,
may have grudged.the spice which the uniform occupied
in his wardrobe. But times have changed ; those clothes
are now brushed with extra care, and the moth found in
their vicinity is tried by court-martial and executed with
a slipper. However, the German Emperor is not the only
foreigner who has the run of the British navy. Alfonso
of Spain lately rowed out to the armored cruiser Bac-
chante, lying at Valencia, and “ inspected various parts
of the ship, particularly the guns, having the mechanism
explained to him.” The only apparent reason for the
Bacchante’s lunacy was the fact that the Spaniard came
aboard disguised as an Admiral of the Breed. The day
may arrive when patriotic Britons will loudly curse the
regalia of the British Admiral as the d—d clobber that
ruined the Empire.
You can't always trust a boy with even the
best of copy-book maxims. Some Melbourne
detectives came to that conclusion the other day.
Acting on “information received,’’ they visited a
house in Fitzroy, and there discovered a youth
and certain goods for which he had no invoices,
and which have since been identified by house-
holders around the suburbs. The youthful house-
breaker might have escaped all but one or two
charges if it hadn’t been for a memo, book he
carried. This volume was adorned with the
before-mentioned maxims : “It is convenient and
wise to make records the night before”; “Set
things down at the time ; then you will remember
them”; “Do it to-day; to-morrow will find
other work,” and so forth. The owner had
carried out the advice thoroughly ; he had visited
houses as a gas inspector, and had “set down”
the positions of gas pipes, jewel cases, wardrobes,
etc., with a view to subsequent proceedings. Now
probably he wishes he had made an effort to
carry these few trifling particulars in his head.
“ Petifi ” : A recent Melbourne Paunch
has a cartoon which it calls “ Building the Gun.”
The picture shows a huge cannon labelled “Im-
perial Defence,” and several ruffians grafting
adjacently. The ruffians are meant to typify
“ The Colonies.” Australia is bullocking with a
colossal mass of cast metal; S’Africa is staggering
under a hod as big as an inverted house; Maori-
land wearily flourishes a shovel at a mullock heap ;
and Canada is humping a box large enough to
make a coffin for Canada and all his family. In
short, “The Colonies” are bogging in to the last
ounce. J. Bull is there too —and, of course, J.
Bull is bogging in also? Nary a bog. J. Bull is
dressed in his Sunday best," and is pompously
directing operations with a sticlc. Also, J. Bull
is orating to the moiling ruffians : “That’s right,
lads, we’re doing famously. There should be no
shirkers nor strikers among the Empire workers.”
Doubtless Paunch means to arouse sympathy with
Bull, but this idea of representing him as the one
loafer of the gang is a misguided way to do it.

The council of Chiltern (Vic.) Shire bared
its soul lately, and publicly lamented its lost
booze. The Licenses Reduction Board has closed
four pubs in the district, and Chiltern is wroth.
So the council resolved to protest to Parliament,
and to point out that the shire had lost (1) £lOO in
revenue, (2) several highly respected publicans
with their wives and children, (3) sundry bar-
maids, and (4) a considerable quantity of bottles
and sundries. Also the local marine store dealer
was complaining of loss of business, while two
widowed washerwomen were suffering grievous
loss of employment, and generally the progress of
Chiltern has been retarded. Therefore Chiltern
in its great tribulation called upon Premier John
Weary to restore to it its four pubs. But, alas !
Chiltern is likely to call in vain ; for John Weary
has grown rather snufflesome of late, and. he is
much more liable to send the applicants a tract on
the Sin of Cigarettes than a new barmaid.
The Old Soldier” : Joe Cook, as Minis-
ter of Defence, has been inquiring into the case of
20 boys who fainted on parade at Adelaide ; and
now the local commandant has reported:—
This was due to the thoughtlessness exhibited by the
officers commanding with regard to the simple and
obvious principle of conserving the strength and comfort
u j elr commands. For instance, on a cold morning,
hundreds of troops, including cadets, were kept on
parade for half an hour because there had been some mis-
take regarding ammunition. To put it plainly, these
cases, which cause some sensation frotn time to time, are
generally traceable to some defect in the control of these
matters, rather than to the delicacy and tenderness of
the uo.vs concerned.
It might be here remarked that the com-
mandant and his district staff are the people
who are responsible for “thoughtlessness” and
“ defects of control.” It is their business to see
that amateur commanding officers are put on their
guard against “thoughtlessness.” These officers
are taught their drill; but that certainly isn’t of
any more importance than the knowledge of how
to conserve the strength and energy of their com-
mands; and that apparently they are not taught
at all. In the field, under good command, in-
fantry is never kept standing unnecessarily in the
ranks. If the men have to remain halted for
more than a very few minutes, either they are
allowed to “fall out,” or they get the word to
lie down. With regard to the “delicacy and
tenderness” of young boys, who in his senses
would expect them to be anything else but tender?
The Germans, who begin with their recruits at 20,
have found by experience that that is too early,
and they recognise that their Landwehr men of
from 25 to 30, or even older, are the best fighting
force. It may be all very well to teach the
youngsters their drill, but even under the best
circumstances show parades are liable to be dis-
astrous ; and you can’t have the best circum-
stances if you have “thoughtless” officers or
defective control.
S. Aus. is priding itself on the fact that
within its dominions only one person out of every
1844 is in gaol. (As to how many ought to be
there, statistics are lacking.) This is the best
State record for the mainland ; though Tas. just
beats it. In the last 25 years the State’s popula-
tion has grown from 300,000 to 400,000; but the
prisoners have dropped from 485 to 219. Accord-
ing to the Sheriffs reports, just issued, the Ade-
laide“gaol has started making straw envelopes for
bottles, and sells hundreds of gross without diffi-
culty at 3s. 9d. the gross. Those imported from
Germany sell at 3s. Gd., and the cheap-and-nasty
Jap article can be got at 2s. 9d.; but the local
article is so far ahead of both that it sells readily.
The Sheriff, who, in S. Aus., is boss of the gaols,
proposes to put about 20 acres of land under crop
to meet the demands of this odd agricultural in-
dustry. The “Stockade,” outside Adelaide, is
built on the edge of a great quarrv,: and helps to
pay its way by selling road metal. There are
prisons also at Port Augusta in the North and
Mount Gambier in the South ; but they both send
in an odd complaint. They used to make a 1 good
deal of money, the one by olive-growing,-.arid the
other by wood-cutting; but now both districts
have grown so moral that they only average
about 2| prisoners each, wherefore these Jugs are
not “remunerative” any longer.
THE USUAL DIAGNOSIS.
CONSTABLE MURPHY (with dignity): “ Phwat’s
up here? Phwat’s the matter wid her?”
Sympathetic Bystander: “It’s ancemiu.”
P. C. MURPHY (seizing the girt): “ Come on,
Ancemia. I s’pose yer drunk.”
“ J.Gr. ” : Be “ Henry Phelthatt’s ” refer-
ence (B. 5/8/’O9). Here is a shorter one and more
to the point which I once saw : “NOTIS, John
Klark is the best dam man I hever add.”
LINES TO A JUDGE OF INNOCENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I am greatly surprised at what has been disclosed in
this case. I always thought that a church choir, especi-
ally a Baptist Church choir, was the most immaculate
thing one could get into. — N.S. W. Judge Rogers(TJj'7l'o9).
Judge, ’tis not so. I grieve to say.
The Choir Immaculate,
The thing which sings while others pray,
And does it in a state
Of chronic virtue’s rare. Choirs stray
With frequency. I hate
To disillusionise one who
Thinks well of choirs, and yet
A love of Truth impels me to
Remark that you would get
The shock of all your life were you
To join one—that I’ll bet.
I, in the days of mv hot youth,
Decided to belong
Unto a choir. I joined, in sooth,
Because I bore a strong
Affection for a maid named R-th,
Who sang in it. That’s long,
Long years ago—yet to this day
Enchanting memories
Come back to me anent the way
We used to hug and squeeze
Up in the organ-loft, alway
In silent ecstasies.
In this r 'spect, I’m bound to own
We twain were not unique.
Far from it. ’Twould have made you moan
And all the world seem bleak
With naughtiness, had you but known
The goings-on, that week
By sinful week occurred up there
Adjacent to the skies.
I mind me our soprano’s hair
Was good. The tenor’s eyes
Gripped hers in ceaseless loving glare :
None of us showed surprise
Although her husband carried round
The plate below our feet;
While his good wife salvation found
By keeping clean and neat
(For nix) the church and steps, and ground
Abutting on the street.
Yearly we picnicked ’neath the trees—
Yet stay ! the fact is clear :
The Judge who feels his marrow freeze
Because he ’haps to hear
Re choirs, must never know of these—
He has too chaste an ear.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
It is half a century this week since the
loss of the Admella, one of the most sensational
wrecks in Australian history. From August 6to
13, 1859, the vessel lay in two pieces on a reef off
Cape Northumberland, halfway between Adelaide
and Melbourne, with the survivors falling off
exhausted every day, and would-be helpers on the
cliffs unable to do anything for want of appliances.
At the end, 22 were taken off alive. Two had got
ashore on a raft at the beginning. It was Adam
Lindsay Gordon who rode to Mount Gambier for
help after those two gave the alarm, and his
poem “From the Wreck” gives a romantic
version of that gallop, with the death of his mare
at the finish. Altogether, there were 83 drowned,
including George Fisher, son of the S. A. Legis-
lative Council President. His brother, Hurtle
Fisher, later on known as a fine old sportsman,
was one of the saved. There were three valuable
racehorses on board ; they swam ashore, and one
of them afterwards won a Melbourne Cup.

“Janor”: Here’s another Australian all
wire and whipcord and grit. Marshall is his
name. He and a mate were lately poking about
an old claim because of a local legend that when
the former owners knocked off at the
bottom of a 40ft. vertical shaft
there was a decent vein show-
ing'. The shaft was bare of
timber or ladders ; but they
rigged np a windlass, had a
look at the bottom, and then
decided that they couldn’t
see what the alleged vein
was made of till they
put in a shot. The mate
went down, put in the
shot, lit the fuse, and got
on to the rope. When
Marshall had hauled him
half way, or so, up, the
makeshift windlass col-
lapsed, and the mate fell
to the bottom, breaking a
leg. Marshall shouted
down, “Put the rope
under your arms,” kicked
the wrecked hauling gear
out of the way, planted a
foot on each side of the
shaft, and pulled his in-
jured mate np hand over
hand. The shot exploded
harmlessly when the
man was but a few feet
up, and he landed on
top without further in-
jury. It was a wonderful
instance of muscular effort
under stress of being in a
tight place. Marshall is a
small man, mostly red beard
and eyebrows on the out-
side, while his mate is a 13-
Stoner. However, this extraordinary display of
strength did not distress him, for, making his
mate as comfortable as possible in the tent, he
walked 25 miles over mountainous country for the
nearest doctor, and piloted the medico back to the
camp the same night. Then, having helped the
doctor to mend the break, and boiled the billy
and made things tidy, he reckoned he’d have
“ a bit of a camp” himself.

With the wet weather arrives the old,
familiar unintelligence that the Moe Swamp
(Vic.) settlers have been flooded out, and are
sitting unanimously on the roof. The morning
paper supplies a few, damp particulars of the
latest submerging :
The embankment of the main drain has broken away in
several places, and the drain is overflowing on each side
into adjoining roads and properties. Gooding’s drain,
Seven-mile drain, Contour drain all overflowed, and the
position is very serious. In many cases stock have been
removed to higher country, as all the paddocks are
flooded.
A large number of houses are surrounded by 3ft. and
4ft. of water, and have been abandoned. Several women
who were rescued from these houses had to be carried
through the water.
In many cases paddocks with growing crops are sub-
nierged. The roads throughout the swamp are almost
impassable, and many bridges have been swept away.
Whilst Victoria’s rich Western District is yawn-
ing for settlers, that benighted State has a lot of
brain and muscle wasting its labor in dismal
places like Moe—where an extra heavy rainfall
always means a shout for lifeboats. Every year
or so some of the Moe settlers have to take to the
roof and sit with their arms round the chimney
until the rescue party rows across the flooded
landscape and takes them off. Then a howl for
financial assistance goes up to the weeping
heavens, for, having been rescued from wet
drowning, they have to he saved from dry penury
in order to bring the thing to a logical conclusion.
It is a dreary old bit of history, and it is repeated
every time the moisture comes down a bit thicker
than usual. There is no reason why any Victorian
agriculturist should have to toil in a swamp and
be chased up to his own roof by floods except the
continued absence of a progressive land-tax.
When that comes down on the Western District,
and the squatter is forced to ascend to his roof
and listen to reason, the yeomanry of Victoria
will be able to come in out of the wet.

“ 3&.M.H. ” on chaff-cutting, bloodshed,
etc.
According to the statements of men who have been
caught in machinery, it is surprising how little it hurts.
It’s afterwards the pain comes. Every chaffcutter
feeder dreads being caught more than he dreads Hell. I
do myself. It is the speed of modern machinery that
causes the accidents. Chaffcutters are now made to take
sheaves three and four deep, and unless the sheaves are
kept rolling in at this pace, the knives come down with
more of a chop than a cut, and this smashes the hay off,
powdering it, rather than cutting it cleanly and crisply.
All day long the feeder rushes the hay to the feed cogs
or rollers, and the rollers snatch it greedily and wind it
into the knives. There is no safeguard for the operator,
and there seems to be no way of introducing one.
Of course, there is reversing gear on all machines, but
presence of mind has a way of deserting men in this par-
ticular emergency. On up-to-date machines the reverse
handle is so placed that should a man get snapped he
falls on it automatically. But even then it means x hand
gone. The drum of a threshing machine is another gory
institution. No one goes into a thresher drum and
lives. There is a platform on top of the machine ;it
is about 12ft. square, and in the 'centre of it is a
gaping hole. Beneath is the drum whirring and roar-
ing 1600 revolutions to the minute. Three men work
on that platform, and one of them has to stand
close to and lean across the drum. A thresher
drum can be protected, but mostly isn’t. The drum
it is that, by its furious speed and the small space
wherein it whirls, threshes the grain out of its casing
called hull chaff. This light casing is blown away by re-
volving fanners. Thegrain beingheavierfallsstraightdown
on to riddles that are hop-hop-hopping sieves, with holes
only large enough to admit of the grain falling through.
It is carried then on elevators to the bags. A certain
amount of smashed-up straw goes down with thegrain,
but the riddles hold this back. The jumping motion
sends it down to the straw elevators, which carry it, along
with the great rolling floods of straw that also come hop-
hop-hopping along riddles, out on to the straw stack.
There four men toil like devils building it into a stack.
Four men also pitch the sheaves to the band-cutters. It
is a strain on a thresher’s internals to drag a tied sheaf
through a space about as wide as a grain of wheat. Still
it does it, and it would drag a man through, too, if it got
him. There are 16 men on a threshing machine, and
they all work. The cocky feeds them, and the pay is 6d.
an hour. A threshing machine is an inferno of heat and
dust and sweat and toil and profanity.

“ Lad ” : Gundagai (N.S.W.) has at least
one thing to its credit; instead of following the
bad old practice and naming its streets after for-
gotten aldermen and other local small fry—the
aldermen themselves mostly do the naming—it
has its goat-walks called after great literary
lights—Sheridan, Virgil, Byron, Homer, Hemans
(phew !) and Pope. There is also a Punch-street
and a Judy-street; so a proposal was made to get
things uniform and change the name of one of
these to Lawson-street, in memory of Henry, the
Australian. Probably if someone had suggested
Omar or Khayyam the idea might have gone
through; but that there was any Australian
writer good enough to give his name to even a
back lane was too much for Gundagai. So it still
has its Punch and Judy streets, and deserves
them.

“ Carte Rouge ” discourses on the tohunga :
The Maori tohunga is quite a person of note and in-
fluence still ; for he must be both an orator and a man of
wiles, else he loses his job. The tribal history and
numberless legends, some extremely beautiful in form and
phrasing, have been passed from tohunga to tohunga, so
that it has been possible to fairly fix the dates of the
various arrivals from Hawaiki, that unknown birthland
of the race, and the subsequent migrations over Te-Ika-a-
Mani and ’Te Waipounamu, which resulted in the forma-
tion of the different families.
Together with the old women, the tohungas are, or
appear to be, marvellously well-versed in the genealogy of
all their chiefs, and of most of the other important men
and women. Cases in the Native Land Courts are there-
fore regarded with dread by the pakeha judges, especially
when the tohunga gets going in true Biblical style with a
seemingly endless chain of “ the son of Tamahau, the son
of ” to prove the priority of a claimant.
The ancient,tohunga-chap was a pretty deadly kind of
fireworks when he really got to work to stir up strife or
take a fall out of an enemy, and for vividness of cuss-
language could lay over both Dowie and Voliva.
“ Tapu ” was one of his mighty weapons, and woe to the
tapu-breaker, for all sorts of gruesome things were liable
to happen to him at the instigation of the god or the
gentleman whose tapu got injured in transmission, so to
speak.
The ceremonies and ritual of many of the tohunga
schools are as much hidden from the pakeha to-day as
they were 50 years ago. Even Christian converts shiver
when they think of what might happen to them if they
let out what little they know, and thus violated the
dread tapu of the gods. The tohungas themselves, no
matter how friendly they may be, are afraid to divulge
to pakehas anything vital connected with the mysteries
(if there are any). But already the tohunga has grafted
Biblical ideas on to his funny-business, and has arrived at
a bastard religion of his own that is neither Pagan nor
Christian, nor anything else but mummery ; wherefore it
is doubtful now whether we shall ever get at the real
inwardness of the business.

“ MacTavish ” : I write hurriedly to ex-
postulate against the absurd attitudes adopted by
common house-flies in their dying moments. I
have made a careful study of the matter and find
that in more times than enough the fly will pass
quietly away with his head adhering to the wall
paper and his feet protruding into space. Imagine
the feelings of his relatives upon discovering a
house-fly swinging by a hind leg to a gas jet. I
say “feelings” advisedly, for I am con-
vinced of the actual existence of same in the
breasts of house-flies. I have seen an elderly
house-fly perishing miserably face downwards in a
jar of honey while his widow wrung her front legs
in sorrow, and asked the friends and relations
gathered on the edge of the jar if there was not
one among them fly enough to go in and recover
the body.

Great leaden clouds go drifting by, like endless Gippsland

It’s wild to-night off Terrigal; it’s wool-white on the reef.
It’s cold to-night round Terrigal—so cold the sea-birds
cry
And skim along the tops and troughs as, tempest-tossed,

And shiv’ring stock scrub-shelter seek from wind and

It’s cold to-night round Terrigal, by reef, and beach, and

It’s lone to-night by Terrigal, no coaster is in sight,
Nor ocean tramp, bound north or south, shows port or

The decomposed sardine.
Within that coast no wraith or ghost
Of punctured metal cows

In solitude to browse ;
But bleaching bones surmount the stones
By'empty waterholes,
Whose mud contains the last remains
Of disembodied souls.
The mystery of history
Broods o’er the stunted trees !
A tragic hush pervades the bush,
And death pervades the breeze !

His circuit of the skies,
When Nature’s host gives up the ghost,
And God’s Last Creature dies.

“ Mallarapoonie ” on the subject of cock-
roaches :
“ 0.0.N.’5” par (B. 27/5/’O9) cuts none of the meat of
human veracity, so to speak, with me ; but writing; of cock,
roaches reminds me of the old Wai-hoi, mail contract and
general cargo steamer, that used to trudge wearily round
the Territory coast in times past. This old craft, originally
built in Hong Kong for river traffic, was brought on to
the North Australian coast to fill the shoes —I mean the
displacement—of the ancient Thomas Andrea, which got
tired of life and yielded up its ghost one calm, sunny day
while under steam off the mouth of the Daly River.
“ Heart disease” was the verdict returned by the marine
coroner in the case of the Thomas Andrea; or, if it
wasn’t, it should have been. The only similar case I know
of was that of Whitton’s Bulldog at Samarai, which
silently gave up its ghost or manifest or something, and
gently sank and disappeared one lovely calm morning
while riding at anchor in China Straits.
The old Wai-hoi was originally fitted with Chinese-
made engine and boilers, but when I knew her first she
had a white Australian engineer in her. Soon after
he took charge of the gear that was in her gizzard that
engineer acquired a sudden and horrible habit of drink—
a matter which seemed unaccountable in so able and in-
telligent a young man. One day, however, at the
engineer’s invitation, I inspected the ship’s machinery,
and after that it was not so much a question why the
engineer drank as why he was ever sober.
With her two dragon-power Chinese-built boilers and
a top hamper in decking that would have done justice to
an ocean-going liner, the old Wai-hoi’s seaworthiness
under ordinary conditions was a thing to view with the
cold, glassy eyeball of suspicion ; but given one of the
most treacherous coasts in the world, with its shallow
seas, its amazing sandbanks, its cranky reefs, and its
gigantic tides that sweep madly in with all the force of
the Indian Ocean behind them, the gyrations of that
ancient craft became, at times, exhilarating, to say the
least. Many times, in my short experience of her, she
evinced a wild desire to quit the sea and walk upon the
dry land. Finally, she got tired of life while in the mouth
of thp ltoper, and now her old bones have found rest at
last.
But as a conveyor of cockroaches that old craft licked
creation. During the years she staggered round the
Territory coast, crawling over sandbars, wriggling among
reefs and islands, and nosing the mainland between
times, she got an occasional scraping on the bottom at
such times as some spring tide lifted her high on a sandy
beach, but never did she receive any kind of fumigation.
The ’roaches in her ranged from hoary patriarchs with
stubbed antennas, and with barnacles and fungus grow-
ing on them—beasts that had seen better days on the
river highways of Canton —down to the newest of
new arrivals. A crack in a wainscot wasn’t an ordi-
nary crack on the old Wai-hoi —it was just a decora-
tive fringe of waving tentacles. In the four-men-
capacity saloon there hung the ship’s framed certi-
cate, which was always again enframed with a
perpetually flourishing coast-line of whiskers. These
whiskers were a joy to us. They forecasted dinner hour
as a barometer forecasts a storm. At ordinary times they
just waved, but when the soup or other well-flavored
victuals were due they waved like mad. Whiskers
sprouted out of every crack and crevice in the ship.
Whiskers—waving whiskers—were on every hand. Hand-
fuls of whiskers were thrown overboard daily. Still one
used not to see many 'roaches —at least, not really so
many, as a rule.
The only time I ever actually saw cockroaches bad on
the Wai-hoi was when coming front Wyndham (W.A.) with
a cargo of semi-green badly-salted bullock hides. That
morning, as we lazed over the long low sunlit swells of
the Indian Ocean we thought we heard teeth gnashing in
the hold where the hides and perfumery were, so the
captain had the hatches off in order to have a look. After
he had peered down into the foetid gloom of the hold for
some moments, he banged the hatch cover with a loud
“ Damn ! ” and gave hurried orders to us to batten it
tightly down, and then went up on the bridge with a face
that was pale and set.. Meantime we stood by the boats.
Afterwards, when the old Wai-hoi was a wreck in the
mouth of the ltoper, and we were abandoning her in the
whaleboat, the captain broke down and wept over the
boat side, overcome to think of the awful loss of life—
cockroach life—caused by the disaster.

“ Yigilans,” from the N.S. W. North Coast
Cow Country :
Some thirteen years ago, before the butter factories
came, farmers in the North were mostly in the hands of
the bank —or the storekeeper. To-day the Tweed, Rich-
mond, Clarence, Dorrigo and Bellinger are all bustle and
activity. Lisinore has grown into a city, and Grafton
also strides on rapidly. The old stamp of impecunious
cocky has gone, and a well-to-do farmer reigns in his
place. At the Bellinger, where at one time they gave the
quarters of a cut up bullock as race prizes and laid
wagers in pumpkins, the teat pullers draw their monthly
cheque from the factories, and money is plentiful. The
factory at Byron Bay pays out a little thing like £60,000
monthly. The big scrub of the Richmond has disappeared,
and the natural grasses have been replaced by paspalum.
Farms are let from £1 to 355. per acre, and land changes
hands at an exorbitant £35 per acre. In this fine coun-
try, always green, a good cow is worth a pound a month
for cream, and in some instances 30s. All sorts of people
are going in for the business. I found three pressmen
making much boodle on a 200-acre patch. Now and
then the people ask how long it will last—how long
butter will fetch its present price. “ Oh,” it can’t be
overdone,” they answer themselves cheerfully ; but if
that is so, these buttermen have struck a line which
differs from every other line in the world.
Adelaide didn’t once get its boots dry
during July : 19 days out of the 31 it rained, and on
the other 12 it threatened to. Between sneezes,
the man in the tratncar guessed that there had
been about 29 inches if there hadn’t been 30 ; and
when, at the end of the month, the
Observatory reported a poor little 3Jin.
altogether, the disgusted inhabitants
sneezed more bitterly than ever, and
said that the instrument was a liar. If
they had been in Sydney, they would
have also mentioned that things weren’t
like that before Federation. It is amaz-
ing how damp and sloppy a city can be
even though it only has 25in. of wet;
and there are few things about which
the average crowd would make worse
guesses than the average rainfall of
half a dozen well-known cities—
assuming, of course, they hadn’t looked
up the records, but merely guessed
according to the cities’ reputation for
dampness and misery. London, for in-
stance, where the Australian mostly has
a cold in his head and his feet, has an
average rainfall of only 24’36in. a year,
and the most it ever recorded was 34’08,
while Sydney’s average is 48'54, and
its highest is 82'81. Edinburgh has an
average of 25, and has got as low as
16‘50, while Perth (W.A.), with an
average of 4673, never had less than 20'48 within
the recollection of its Oldest Instrument.
“Pick”: The old and oft-read tales of
wildly-exciting fox-hunts in the Ancient Country
have lost their charm for me. On Monaro
(N.S.W.) the boundary-riders, with the help of
two or three collies, run down on an average
two or three foxes per month, and it rarely needs
more than a half-mile gallop on a hard-hoofed
old stockhorse to blow out the snapping, smell-
some fraud, of whose wonderful long-distance
runs we have read in a hundred English and Irish
sporting novels. Either
the Monaro fox has
lost most of his wind
and leg, or the novel
writers were 22-carat
liars. Or, on second
thoughts, it may be
that the Monaro collies
and nags are like the
west wind for swift:
ness.
UNGRATEFUL.
BENNO (telling the story of his betrayal):

“Wang ” discourses about suitable prizes :
At bush picnics footraces are the favorite pastime.
They are contested with vigor, and the prizes are handed
to the winners by the parson, accompanied by a few
appropriate remarks.
The prizes do not always give complete satisfaction. I
remember once running second in a race, and I felt glad I
had run second when I found that the first prize was
“The Pilgrim’s Progress.” The subsequent progress of
the pilgrim who won it to a place where he could curse
without fear of interruption was a thing to behold.
I joined him a few seconds after with the second prize,
a book entitled “ Healthy Talks for Young Men.” The
healthy talk that issued from that retired spot, as I in-
spected my prize, was not obtained from the book.
We presented our newly-won treasures to Props, the
local beer-sparrer, and that evening, chancing to call into
the Farmers’ Arms for a lemonade apiece, we found Props
driving a bargain with the landlady. I never knew what
beauties those books contained till I heard Props explain-
ing about them to the landlady. He got two pints for
them.
At another picnic a great race was expected as the
result of some judicious advertising on the part of the
picnic committee. The event was called a mystery race,
the mystery being the fact that the exact nature of the
prize was kept a secret. It leaked out, however, that it
was, variously, a gold watch-chain, a diamond pin, and a
lady’s bracelet.
The lads put in some solid training for a fortnight
before the picnic, and the race itself was a splendid effort.
Big Bill Jenkins got across the tape first by about a toe-

nail, and his girl led him proudly up to receive the gold
biacelet. But the language and general behavior of Bill
when a sixpenny undressed doll was handed to him,
amidst cheers of derision from the defeated lads, caused
the picnic ground to become speedily deserted.
The finest prize I ever raced for was a fine, hollow, red
gum tree with a hole in the butt just big enough to
allow me to crawl in. Once inside, I feared nobody armed
with slippers or straps. Alas ! A day came when I
couldn’t get more than my head in. The enemy charged
me repeatedly in the rear, and I retired, defeated and
hurt in my tenderest feelings.
King, the only survivor of the Burke and
Wills expedition, used to say that the alleged
explorers’ last camp before retracing their steps
was on the Albert River. Baron von Mueller,
after examining the manuscript relics, concluded
it was on the Flinders. The point has been
settled by Mr. Thos. Graham, of Magoura
station, who recently undertook to search, and he
found the marked trees on the eastern bank of the
Bynoe River.
“Starfish” (from the afflicted locality):
“ James Pannikin ” speaks truth when he observes
that foxes are becoming dense west of the Big
Trickle. There should be good money in trapping
them while the bounty of ss. per head and tail
lasts. An energetic trapper should earn £6 a
week. Poisoning is the best mode of procedure.
A jackeroo on Garnpang, on the east side of the
river, lately bagged £23 at the game in one month
during his spare time. And foxes are about as
thick west now as they were east then. Someone
really ought to descend on all this capital that’s
running about and poison it. We want to get
it out of the country.
RIME OF A BUSH SMITHY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The striker, he of the naked chest and the fierce and
flashing eye,
He lives loud life in a whirl of sound where the rushing
moments fly
Untold, in a flood that drifts him, striving, down to the
edge of dark,
Hunting his crust from morn till eve in a twilight of
smoke and spark.
The Old Man drags red metal out, and he naps it fair and
true,
And the striker follows him, clang and crash, with the hot
air rolling blue.
The striker bangs his sledge, and sweats, and carries his
load along
With a light and careless heart all day, and —hear ! —he
sings a song!
The wheezing bellows growl, and the slacked coal-fringes
steam and purr,
And the metal groans in the water-butt, as the dull steel-
purples blur
And change ; and the boss gives forth weird words as the
sun, just overhead,
Crawls by in a torrid, thirsty calm, when the cool creek-
breeze drops dead.
In strap and shoe, in bar and block, in sheets of crackling
black,
Here, hobs of Hell, in sample, spark in the heat o’ the
smithy-shack,
And, red in the gloom o’ the forge, the scarlet cinders
fall and fly,
As the striker gives a blow, and humps the swage-block
anvil high.
The shy bush-hacks come in for shoes, in a flutter of
anxious felir,
And the gaunt team-horses, lazy, lumber in on their
loafing-gear,
And the air goes bluer, by-and-bye, and a fountain of
sound breaks forth
As the hacks go back on the boss, and a hot wind leaves
the blazing north ;
But, though the boss goes mad. and the noise of his raving
fills the land,
The bellows-lever, steady, swings beneath the striker’s
hand.
And whatever the day brings forth in toil, and whatever
in Hell goes wrong,
The forge-->hilosopher, dusty-browed, finds time to sing
his song 1

According to London Times Freefcrade
Britain has now got this far :
Mr. Arthur Mackarness informs us that when he was
ordering ammunition for service rifles he was informed
that the majority of riflemen now use foreign ammuni-
tion known as “ Rhen West.” “ This,” he says, “ appears
a very grave scandal. The mere idea of a British rifleman
being dependent on a foreign manufacturer for his
ammunition seems to me absolutely wicked.”
Just at present Toryism has two main
objections to the graduated land-tax. One is that
it is confiscatory ; the other is that it will so com-
pletely fail to confiscate anything that it won’t
break up the big estates after all. If these two
drawbacks could be got over, the Tory class would
at once abandon all opposition.


THE LOAN AND THE OLD AGE PENSIONER.

Perhaps she’s on the railway ;
Perhaps she’s on the sea ;
Perhaps she’ll go
To Jericho,
Perhaps she will; perhaps she won’t;
But if she does, or if she don’t,
Pm glad that I presented to her
A bottle of Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure.*
The Peril of our Time
Is lung disease. Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery for
coughs and colds cures lung trouble. Small dose.
Pleasant to take. Every bottle guaranteed.
Price Is. Gd. and 3s.*
As the tendency nowadays is to deaden
pain instead of coring the disease that causes it, a
great deal of opium and other narcotics are used
in the manufacture of medicine. This is especially
so with cough mixtures. Such medicines are
worse than no medicine at all, for the effect the
narcotic has on the brain and nervous system is
most dangerous.
For this reason we want to impress upon you
the importance of using Chamberlain’s Cough
Remedy, for this remedy contains no opium or
other narcotic.
This is not merely a statement of the manu-
facturers, but each bottle of Chamberlain’s Cough
Remedy contains the Government analysis, show-
ing that it has been officially declared free from
all narcotics.*
PERSONAL
ITEMS
THAT GOOD MAN. ROBERT HARPER ,
M.P. (Victoria).
Mr. Isaacs, formerly stipendiary magis-
trate at Sydney, who retired and went to end his
days in England, is coming back to end his days
in Australia. He reckons the English climate
showed indecent haste to end his days. He went
there to die, and he was so nearly doing it that he
got disgusted with the place. Besides, all the
graves there are damp and wretched, and a dry
Australian ghost hates to get up in the middle of
the night and bale out its last resting-place.
Donald W. Smith, who was something of
a notable pedestrian in the Tasmanian Inky Way,
passed out at Hobart the other day. Smith was
one of the best known of Tassy pressmen, and at
one time edited the Launceston Examiner. He
also had a spell at politics as representative for
the same village in the House of Assembly. As a
youth he was a classmate of Alfred Deakin at the
Melbourne Anglican Grammar School, * though
that isn’t as big a distinction as it looks. Almost
everybody and everything has been associated
with Altie at one time or other.
According to Knibbs’ survey of
the Registrar’s returns, Australia’s best
mother last year presented her 25th child
to the Commonweath. And she has done
it all inside 23 years.
Concerning Premier Wade :
Wood is not nearly so tactless as Wade.
Wood makes repellent remarks and cantanker«
ous interjections, but Wood does grin and try
to discount his sourness. He looks abashed and
sorry, and his countenance seems to say he
never meant it. Wade, on the other hand, is
about as suave as a barrow with an ungreased
wheel. Under criticism, he is as grumpy as a
gouty bachelor. He is no more enthusiastic
than a cart-horse in a cold paddock, waiting
for a feed. He has no moments of expansion.
Six years in the Assembly, three years a
Minister, and two years a Premier, yet be
hasn’t flashed a witticism or phrased a mirth-
provoking idea. He is formality gone to seed.
Somebody said he is the author of the Petty
Debts and Small Beer Acts, and somebody has
sized him accurately. Lucky to get there, he is
luckier to remain there. The morning press
keeps him there, because the morning press
can’t change him for something more cheerful.
When Wade is not sitting, bored and heavv-
lidded, among bis wholly unenthusiastic fol-
lowers in the House he is, for the most part,
the solemn and solitary occupant of his Minis-
terial room. He is scarcely on speaking terms
with the Labor members, and he has no time
or temperament for his own crowd. He may
enjoy life, but if so he conceals the fact in a
dark place, and only gives way to wild merri-
ment in the dead of night.
With Mrs. Penelope Jung, who has just
died at the age of 80, residence in Balmain
(Sydney) was a habit. She hung out there for
57 years. It was in 1852 that she arrived from
London—Londoners live long when they get
away from London—and settled in Balmain.
The streets were bush-tracks then, and the baby
ferry-boat travelled semi-occasionally, or not even
so often as that. Balmain had no municipal debt,
no aldermen, no aldermanic row, no docks, no
drains, and no football push in those primitive
days. People who wanted water either bought a
tank or sunk a well. The one thing that was up to
date was the landlord : he charged 30s. a week for
a four-roomed weatherboard palace. The landlord
arrived so early that he was in full blast before
the kangaroo had been chased out of the main
street.
By the Oldest Inhabitant: —
Apropos Smiths in the Victorian Parliament(B. 12/8/'O9).
At one time there were five of them, and one F. L.
Smythe—the latter an Irish barrister with a brogue broad
enough to stretch from the Hill of Howth to Conne-
mara. He was Chairman of Committees, and became a
Crown Prosecutor. Then there was the doyen of the
name, John Thomas Smith, seven times Mayor of Mel-
bourne and a Minister of State. Next was L. L. Smith,
of pills and racing fame, who became an honorary Minister
under “Broguey” O’Loghlen. William Collard Smith,
the Ballarat man with the big feet, had the reputation
of having blackmailed land buyers when State lands were
sold by the week and by auction. He became Treasurer
under Berry, and legend has it that in his one and only
financial statement he stopped short in the midst of
announcing a two-million surplus, being frozen with
horror at the recollection that he had forgotten all about
the interest on the public debt. Also there was George
Verney Smith, a red-shirted digger, who represented The
Ovens and never appeared in the electorate without his
red shirt and sash. He also became a Minister of State.
He was a studious man, oftener seen in the library than
in the refreshment-room. Finally, there was A. J.
Smith, a naval ex-lieutenant, who represented the diggers
of Castlemaine, or should have but didn’t. He repre-
sented the other dog.
Samuel Hordern, Australia’s biggest store-
keeper, who died in Sydney last week, left four
sons and four married daughters to divide his two
or three millions. What the estate will cut up for
nobody, of course, knows to a million or so ; but
even when Anthony, jun., Sam’s elder brother,
died 23 years ago, Sam paid £151,000 for his half-
share of the business. The “Universal Pro-
videry ” has grown tremendously since then ; and,
besides, the man who owned the whole of it owned
also a vast quantity of city and suburban property
—in the city proper he was the biggest single
ratepayer. “Young Sam,” the eldest son,
has been for years in the business with
his father, getting to know the strength of the
head of every department. Hordern, senior,
always left a lot to his “heads ” ; but there were
times when he didn’t hesitate to go dead against
the advice of the whole lot of them. He is sup-
posed to have done something of that sort when
he decided on building his huge stores where they
are. And when he did decide on it he made up
his mind about two things—to have the cash to
do it with, and to cut out the contractor. “Young
Sam,” the new head of the concern, married the
eldest daughter of the late John See ; so the wolf
doesn’t prowl round that doorstep.
Thus the Oldest Inhabitant :
Samuel Hordern, who was laid to rest at Rookwood
Cemetery (N.S.W.) on Sunday last, was of the third
generation of drapers. His grandparents arrived in
Sydney in 1823. The original Anthony Hordern was a
Coachbuilder, and commenced business on an open space
of ground off King-street. This place was afterwards
known as Terr.v’s-lane and, later still, as Lee’s Court. On
the corner of the lane Mrs. Hordern started a little mil-
linery business, and they kept in the locality until the
late ’forties. Anthony I. had five sons—John, Anthony 11.,
Lebbius, Edward, and William. All except the last,
who made his home in Melbourne, were in the
drapery biz. John was the first to start out for
himself, at Nottingham House, corner of George-street
and Charlotte Place (now Grosvenor-street). He
was the father of Hordern Brothers, of Pitt-street.
Anthony 11. and Lebbius opened on Brickfield Hill in the
late ’forties. Before the mid ’fifties they separated.
Lebbius kept the original business, on a site near Swan-
street, now absorbed in the big building. Anthony 11.
went to the Haymarket, on a site three doors from Hay-
street. That was the genesis of the enormous business
over which the late Samuel Hordern presided. When his
sons Anthony 111. and Samuel were of age they were
taken into the business, which became Anthony Hordern
and Sons. Anthony 111. died of sunstroke on board the
mail steamer Carthage, in September, 1886, in the Indian
Ocean, within two days’ steam of Albany, where the body
was buried. He was born in Melbourne in 1842. The origi-
nal Anthony I. bought, at auction, in February,
1839, certain town lots in Melbourne, which, at his death
in the early 'seventies, were sold under his will, the
amount realised being £65,321. The original cost was
£370. The purchase money for those allotments was
made in the coach smithy and the little drapery shop in
King-street, Sydney. Anthony 11. was a resident of Mel-
bourne in 1840. There is a fourth Anthony on Brickfield
Hill, possibly a fifth.
An official in the N.S.W. Old-age Pensions
Office lias informed the papers that some old
people who are unable to write have been charged
3d. each by “a certain J.P.” for witnessing their
marks. If this is correct the publication of the
fact (without the name of the J.P.) doesn’t even
begin to meet the case. The name of that J.P.
deserves a large generous publicity, and when he
is expelled from J.P.-dom it should be done after
the manner of the ejection of Walter Baker from
the British army in the B. Holt drama “One of
the Best.”
THE HIGHEST ATTAINMENT OF THE
PROFESSION.
THE GENTLE MISSIONARY: “ Brother , have you
never had any ambition for higher things? ”
THE BROTHER (a discharged burglar): “I did;
in my youth I hoped to one day be a bank
manager.”
Victoria’s wonderful Bent, now affecting
an aureole and a saintly manner after the findings
of the late Commission, is still a dodger of great
art. The other day he started to talk of
resigning his seat in the Vic. Assembly, and he
did it in such a tone of tearful solemnity that his
constituents thought he meant it. Thereupon
they hastily convened a meeting to express their
unbounded confidence in the shameless battler.
Probably he had not the slightest intention of
throwing up such an easy job, and only gulfed to se-
cure a badly-needed advertisement, which his con-
stituents proudly gave him. Despite his loud poli-
tical disrepute, Brighton still regards Bent as
somebody in the nature of a New Messiah.
Senator Stewart accomplished a consider-
able feat the other night when, by a powerful,
closely-reasoned speech, he persuaded Millen and
Sayers to reverse their votes in favor of giving
pensions to Asiatics, and thus caused the return
of the Bill to the Reps, for re-consideration.
Macaulay performed a similar feat on a memor-
able occasion, and Sheridan is said to have delib-
erately set himself to change the mind of the
House on a question he didn’t care a hang about,
just from pure devilment. But Stewart couldn’t
do anything out of devilment —he’s
in dead earnest all the time.
A CHARITY ORGANISER.
LITTLE GRABSTEIN : “ Fader, give me twopence.”
FADER : “ Vot for, mine son? ”
L. G.: “ I want to give der poor plind man a
penny!”
“Cape York”: Would like to introduce
the Armbrust family, of Coen, in the far north
Queensland, to some of the black labor crowd who
state white people cannot live in the North.
This family consists of eight sons and four
daughters. Five of the boys are over 13 stone,
and the three younger ones promise equally well.
All the girls are well over the average, one of
them—an infant of 17 —being sft. lOin. in height
and 12 stone in weight. They were all born
north of Cooktown, and not one has been south
of Townsville.
In defending a Melbourne youngster
charged with sending a threatening letter, Lawyer
Purves told a cheerful yarn of his boyhood days,
when he and sundry mates set out to be buc-
caneers. Arming themselves with pickets and
rusty knives, they took the warpath to an
adjacent swamp, and valiantly attacked and slew
a pig. The pig happened to belong to Money
Miller, who was a thrifty person with a defective
sense of humor, so the buccaneers’ parents had to
pay for it. Since then, Purves has stuck many a
fat pig, but he uses a bill of costs now instead of a
picket.
Holme Lacey, the old Chesterfield house,
recently purchased by Australian beer-monger
Tooth, has some indirect Australian associations.
In the long ago, when there were no postage
stamps, any person of great tonnage could
“frank” his letters by writing his name in the
corner. The person of importance was thus a
de idhead through the post; other folks paid cash.
A hundred years or so back a parson who was
tutoring in the Chesterfield employ saved lOd. by
writing the nobleman’s name on his own letter,
and was lagged for it.
The late Speaker Holder’s first serious job
in politics wasn’t in his own interests, but as an
opponent of “Ebbv ” Ward, in those days South
Australia’s most brilliant and unregenerate free-
lance politician. It was the unregenerate part of
Ward that stirred Holder to action, and he
addressed a meeting in opposition to the sinner.
But alas ! it didn’t turn" out as expected, for before
it was over “Ebby” himself turned up, and the
meeting gave three cheers for “Ward, Women, and
Wine” ; and Holder went home with a lump in
his throat. To make matters worse, the first
member of the trinity was elected.
“ Melbournian ” sends an obituary :
Recent deaths include the name of Martin Hood (pro-
nounced Hud), aged 88, the champion senior Catholic
layman and teetotal advocate of this city. He was
brought up to the wine and spirit trade ; then he became
the greatest Melbourne brewery manager, as factotum of
P. J. Martin, who was said to have about a quarter of the
pubs under his thumb. Yet Hood, from time immemo-
rial, was the most bigoted of teetotalers, and died unre-
pentant in that faith. In the last generation, or the one
before last, he stood quite alone amid leading Catholic
laymen as a water-drinker. Nothing tickled him more
than to hear, in later years, about the blank amazement
of a master brewer, who, after showing the reporters of
the Argus, Age and Herald around his beer mill, found
they were all teetotalers. The anti-drink movement
was then spreading fast. Hood was a little, thin, pale,
feminine sort of fellow. Many a time did O'Grogagain
and MacFirewather say to him, “Ah, Hud, ye’ll doi,
malm ; ye’ll doi of yer craze. Ye're perishin’ by inches,
malm, for the lack of a shtimulant.” “ B’ys, b’ys,”
Hud would screech, in reply, with a voice like the death-
cry of Johnny Fawkner, “ Oi’m sor-r-ry to say, Oi’l be
dancing-over yer gra-a-ves.”
About an old civil servant, a grave, etc. :
Among recent deaths at Melbourne was that of Arthur
Morrah, who passed out at his residence, St. Kilda, at the
age of 70 years. He entered the public service in the
early ’fifties, and was connected with the Lands Depart-
ment for many years ; in fact, he attained the position of
secretary. Subsequently he was an audit commissioner
and a member of the Public Service Board. At one time,
in the mid-’sixties, he was in charge of auction sales and
regularly took his seat beside Auctioneers Gemmell or
Tuckett or McOaul when State lands were auctioned. On
one occasion a peculiar little lot came up for sale. It had
no description beyond the fact that it was an acre on
Diamond Creek at Eltham. In those days there was a
speculator named McDonald, who bought State land any-
where. He bid for this acre on general principles, and
was opposed byabushman who appeared determined to
have the bit of soil. A bj'stander, who knew why the
acre of bush land was for sale, suggested to McDonald
that he should retire, and gave the reason. Mr.
Morrah was wildly indignant at the interference ; the
Government, he said, were entitled to the highest price it
could get, etc., etc. But the auctioneer gave no explana-
tion about the acre, and few in the room knew. The cir-
cumstances were these. A New South Wales bushranger
named Burke appeared at Diamond Creek, at the farm-
house of Robert Face.v Hurst, a single man living with
his sisters. Hurst was absent. Burke demanded break-
fast, and a sister set a meal for him in thekitchen. Ashe
threw open his coat she saw revolvers in bis belt. While
he was eating his meal, the girl sought the brother, who
was out on the farm. Pie armed himself with a gun and
ill-advisedly questioned Burke, who drew a revolver, and
in the struggle which ensued Hurst was shot. Burke was
hanged. Hurst’s body was buried on the farm, which
was State leasehold. The family applied for the lot as a
grant, but was refused. As a compromise the Govern-
ment surveyed an acre around the tomb, and put it up at
auction at £4 per acre. It realised £4O, through Mr.
Morrah’s reticence. The Hursts bought it, and erected a
monument over the grave. McDonald had vague ideas
that he was bidding for a gold mine or something of the
sort instead of a dead body.
“Praicher” : John Yerran, S. Australia’s
Cousin-Jack Parliamentary Labor
leader, is, as The Bulletin remarked
the other week, a quaint “local
preacher.” Cornwall has had many
of’em—quite historical now and then,
like Dan’l Quorm, for instance, whose
name pretty well every Cornishman
knows. But Jack Yerran is one of
the few of the type that Australia
has ever seen. Said John lately,
preaching to a congregation of Cornish
people: “You can’t come none of
your funny business with God; I
tell ee straight, God is top dog every
time.” The congregation never
dreamt of blasphemy, and neither
did John ; “ the chapel” regarded
it as the utterance of a powerful
preacher, and when elections
come they “do all plump for Jack,
and put ’e in ’pon top of poall.”
“S.T.S.”: And so C. B. Luffmann has
gone into a Spanish monastery (8., 5/8/’O9). Some
good fellows took me, a visitor to Melbourne, far
up the Yarra one Sunday afternoon. While we
rowed round and round the asylum, an
unknown in my boat talked Trees. He knew
every tree that grew; and just how it grew, and
why "it grew that particular way, and apparently
(as Ichabod Bronson says) how it would have
grown if it hadn't grown the way it did grow. At
supoer at Heidelberg a friend, said “ You were
in luck. You had Luffmann in your boat.” And
he indicated the botanical expert. “Him?” I
said. “He is a plain bore.” Just then Luff-
mann opened fire, and for a solid hour he kept
the long table in a roar while he told of lectures he
had given, and the rude, funny things said by
people in the audience. He was not musical;
otherwise he could well have held his own with
any Leslie Harris or Grossmith before the public.
In the train, going home, I got next to him, and
discovered a third side of his character. We
talked books all the way, and I only left him
about midnight, at the Age office, where he had
to produce some Agricultural Notes. I was to
visit him in some rural suburban spot, but never
managed it. Of a fourth side to him, as a traveller
in many lands, he said no word that day. Doubt-
less he was many-sided. But Ido hope there is
no irksome Rule of Silence in that Spanish
monastery.
WANTED, A HOUSEKEEPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
TXTANTED Housekeeper, child not objected, country
'' North. Apply by letter, state age, etc., to
Widower, this Office. —Brisbane paper.
Love’s spring has flown, a rose full-blown ;
Even roses have a fancy—
There are honey bees in the lilac trees—
And sweethearts for Nell and Nancy.
The metaphor, though it is not hoar
Nor hallowed by old tradition,
Is as true as life, in which death is rife ;
And it leads up with expedition
To this idle lay, of the wily way
Of the modern advertiser.
He wants a mate who is up to date,
Named Lucy or p’r’aps Elizer.
No lily white in virtue dight,
Nor blossom bursting newly ;
No violet shy with shrinking- eye,
But a full-blown rose unruly.
If she pulled the thorn, in the dewy morn
When the birds were sweetly singing-;
Or in the dusk, filled with scented musk,
When the love bells loud were ringing.
While the world goes round, and Spring is gowned
(Oh, the old brown earth is greening !)
In her wondrous dress, and the soft caress
Of the wind the old leaves is gleaning.
And the bellbirds sing, and their tuneful ring
Strikes a chord in the dreaming- maiden,
And the rippling rill sets her heart a-thrill
To a world with joy o’erladen.
With Lovea-fire, while an unseen Lyre
Fills the air with its music splendid,
And a haunting note seems to rise and float
And hang in the air suspended
O'er a faery wood where all seems good,
And she listens and stops and falters ;
Full many a lute lies stringless, mute
Upon Love’s rose-strewn altars.
And so sweet May, having had her day
With her hero, her prince romantic,
Must look for work where dangers lurk,
And ogres are grim, gigantic.
She must mend and moil, in the laundry toil;
Of romance there isn’t an ember ;
So she sits her down in her working gown
And answers the ad. of December.
QUEENSLAND.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
This was the story that Bigjohn Forrest, Com-
monwealth Treasurer, told when he laid his Estimates
before the House last week. He expects a Customs and
Excise revenue of £10,800,000, or £43.985 less than last
year’s actual collections. This £10,800,000 will be cut up
as follow's :
Cost of collection .. .. .. £282,474

The difference between the gross Customs and Excise
revenue and the total revenue is made up mainly of—
Post-office, £3,550,000 ; and profit on coinage, £lOO,OOO.
Post-office receipts will, however, it is expected, be
£419,815 less than the expenditure. Expenses in collec-
tion with the coinage will be £lO,OOO. So this is the

Fourteen months ago William Lyne saw som«-
thing in the distance ; so, the States having already for
that year got more than their three-fourths as provided
by the Braddon clause, he hung on to the surplus re-
ceipts for the month of June, and was called a brigand for
his foresight and statesmanship. Last year, however,
something of the same sort was done ; so now there is
£655,800 in hand. But, setting even the whole of this
against the year’s deficit, about £1,200,000 will remain.
Down to June, 1908, the States had received £6,059,088
more than they were entitled to under the
Braddon clause. Commonwealth Governments knew
that very heavy expenditure was looming ahead;
they knew that old-age pensions were coming ; and they
knew' that it was the proper thing to provide in advance
for those pensions, just as one has to do if one goes to an
insurance office to buy an old-age annuity. But the State
Frights crowd buzzed so much and bit so venomously,
and the Commonwealth crowd was so lacking in pluck
and backbone, that every penny that the Commonwealth
could save bj’ starving its own services and ignoring the
future was paid over to the States—until W. Lyne per-
formed the “ brigand ” act before-mentioned. Meantime
several of the States had such surpluses that they
lopped off local taxation and loafed on the Commonwealth.
Now, however, there apparently isn’t one of them ready to
say—“ You starved yourself in the past and overpaid us.
Now we will give you a bit of a lift; and we’ll accept two-
thirds instead of three-fourths of the Customs.” That
was one possible way of dodging- the deficit; and, con-
sidering that the announcement of a huge Australian
deficit will be bound to affect the credit of the States, it
would probably have paid them handsomely to have
adopted it.
Apparently, however, the Commonwealth
Government didn’t suggest anything of the sort; and it
hasn’t got the pluck to demand a land-tax or more
revenue from other sources. It just falls back on the
refuge of the shiftless and the improvident—the pawn-
shop. The £1,200,000 is to be raised by short-dated
Treasury bills. It isn’t even pretended that the money
is to be spent on “ permanent and reproductive works ”
the old gag with which the States’ borrowings are mostly
excused. The plain, hideous fact is that this spineless
Government won’t even ask Australia to pay its ordinary
housekeeping expenditure, but is going to pass a great
part of the bill on to the children. It is mean, contempt-
ible, and cowardly. The ordinary borrowing policy is
bad enough. But this isn’t the ordinary borrowing
policy; for this Government proposes to ask the future
to pay the bill, not for works of which it will have the
use, but for to-day’s salaries, and to-day’s pensions, and
to-day’s odds and ends.

It is a rather inopportune time for a Maoriland bank to
put up its dividend. Certainly the chairman has told
shareholders that the extra 1 per cent, “may not be re-
peated,” but that announcement only makes its wisdom
still more doubtful. The Board admits that things in
lou Ward’s dominions are very uncertain, and but for the
improvement in the price of wool and the fine agricul-
tural outlook “ the condition of affairs would cause con-
siderable anxiety ” ; and still it pays a higher dividend
which it admits it may not be able to repeat. The
present high prices for wool, wheat, and meat will no
doubt help Maoriland through; but those things
can’t be relied upon to last. In fact, it is practi-
cally (e.-tain that they won’t last for long; and the
question is whether Maoriland will make the best
use of them while they do last. As the chairman
of the B.N.Z. said at the recent annual meeting—
“lt is most disconcerting to have to admit, in view of
the long period of prosperity, covering practically
15 years, that a sudden drop in values of our primary
produce, for one season only, should cause such a finan-
cial disturbance as we have been experiencing.” If
15 years of prosperity wasn’t sufficient to render the
Ricketty Islands capable of standing up against one
moderately poor season, is it certain that three or four
more good years will do the trick? The fact is that much
of the land has been bought on the basis of boom prices
and boom years ; and the same applies to many busi-
nesses. For these people there is nothing for it but hard
economy, so that they may gradually get ahead of things,
and so prepare for the inevitable poor years. Even then
large numbers of securities will be thrown on the
hands of banks, etc. ; and the extra 1 p. c.
which this bank pays in dividend might well
have been put by to provide against that trouble.
“ It is probable,” said the chairman of this bank, explain-
ing why things had gone wrong with Maoriland—“ it is
probable that the standard of living has been going up
rather too rapidly during the past few years.” And
having got rid of this smug observation, the London
chairman of a bank which had put up its dividend from
6 to 12 per cent, in 10 years announced a further 1 per
cent., presumably by way of setting the Maoriland public
a good example !
The bank’s figures for the year show no great
changes :

The debt to the public is £4,637,054 ; and the capital and
reserves total £736,363, so that there is £6 6s. of the
public’s in the business for every £1 of the shareholders .
A trifle over three millions of the public’s money, besides
the shareholders’ funds, is in advances and similar
securities ; so the shareholders’ risks are very substantial.
Under those circumstances, profits naturally show up
well ; for the year, they amount to £lO 4s. lOd. per cent,
of capital and reserves. But what seem to be profits to-
day may turn out to be something else to-morrow ; it
isn’t safe to regard the apparent profits of the boom years
as being absolutely earned until the slump has happened,
and you have been able to count up also the losses which
show up then.

This is only the fourth dividend in 18 years. Theco. chose a
disastrous time to be born in—almost at the top of the
boom in pastoral properties. One of its ideas was to go
in for meat freezing and export. But the absurd prices
paid for land led to overstocking ; and, when the rabbits
also arrived in swarms, the country was left in no condition
to stand a drought: so the losses of stock were appalling,
and the co. had nothing to freeze. It then set to work
to build up a wool and general pastoral-agency business;
and by' keeping its nose to the grindstone and its hand
out of the till it has got the better of most of its troubles.
There is, it is true, still a goodwill item of £24,516
in the balance-sheet; and obviously that ought to
be written off out of profits. In the foregoing table
this item hasn’t, of course, been treated as an asset.
Besides the amounts shown as added to reserves,
something of unspecified size has been written off from
profits to cover depreciation—presumably of “freeholds,
lands, building, machinery and plant.” The co. owns
three freezing works in the country as well as the one on
North Shore (Sydney); and much depends on the wear
and tear allowed for. It isn’t merely that this sort of
plant wears out rapidly ; new appliances are constantly
coming into use, and to keep pace with competitors the
old plant has to be scrapped, and its value ought to be
written off out of revenue—which is another way of say-
ing that the new plant ought to be paid for out of re-
venue. As to whether enough is written off in this case
no opinion can be expressed. The balance-sheet figures
have in recent years moved as follows: —
1902. 1907. 1908. 1909.

bentures, etc. £102,217 £52,454 £74,771 £57,453

Stocks .. .. 3,111 7,980 10,754 6,280
Paid capital, which in 1902 was £121,679, is now £126,147 ;
there are 34,185 shares, some paid to £3 ss. and some to £4.
The financial position has thus moved in seven years like
this:—Total liabilities have been reduced by £44,946,
while the book value of assets has been reduced by only
£2llB ; and for that marked improvement new capital got
in is responsible for only £4468. Excellent progress
has been made in working down the debt; assuming that
the assets are now only as productive as they were seven
years ago, the co. is £2247 a year better off from the
saving in interest, calculating that the debt carried an
average of 5 per cent. Also it is highly probable that the
£74,287 of advances are worth as much as if not more
than the £87.412 on the books seven years ago. For
years the situation looked hopeless ; and though the
debt is still heavy, and the business liable to many ups
and downs, the doctors who have been in attendance on
the paiient ought to be very well satisfied with the
apparent recovery.

So the Lyne tariff is doing its work. Under the old State
tariff this co. had the benefit mostly of a 25 per cent,
duty, and with that help it built up a very fair business,
and paid good wages. Then Queensland was mad enough
to send along some Freetraders to help destroy its own
industries ; and, though that crowd never got control, it
joined with the “moderate” Protectionists (who believe
in starving in moderation), and cut down Kingston’s
tariff, so that in the six years from 1902 to 1907 not a
farthing was paid in dividends. In fact, after allowing
for wear and tear, the works were kept going at an abso-
lute loss. Then W. Lyne bullocked through his tariff, and
things at once began to look up, though even now they
are only good enough to allow' of a 5 per cent. div. No
doubt 5 per cent, is pretty fair interest; but it isn’t nearly
enough considering the risks run by money invested in
the manufactures of a country which has four or five
Foreign-traders in its Government. In one respect,
Walkers’ management has been excellent; during the dry
years it didn’t attempt to hide the fact that its plant was
wearing out or becoming obsolete ; so, as there wasn’t
enough to cover depreciation and provide dividends, it
was the dividends that were dropped. The result is that
the financial position has*been steadily strengthened;
yet, so it seems, this has been done chiefly at the expense
of the w'orks, plant, appliances, etc. In other words, as
plant u'ore out or became obsolete, the outlook wasn’t
good enough to justify the co. in putting new plant in its
place. Hence some of these figures :

Besides the help of the Commonwealth tariff, the co. has
got some from the State Government, which is having
numerous locos, built at these works. In one respect,
the Queensland industry has been fortunate for many
years past; the biggest concerns in the State —cos. like
Mount Morgan—have made a point of buying Australian,
and if possible Queensland, goods whenever they were
within coo-ee of the foreigner’s price. But, though that’s
a splendid feeling to encourage, it is just as well to have
it backed up with a high tariff, which puts temptation
out of the way.

The present co. was formed in 1903 ; at that time £6BOO
was written off capital. The present paid capital is
£27,200 in 34,000 shares of £1 paid to 16s. Large and
apparently profitable contracts are in hand ; and fail-
provision seems nowadays to he made for depreciation.
It is claimed that new supplies of gravel are constantly
brought down by the river ; as for the rest, it was officially
stated two years or so back that depreciation at the rate
of 2d. per ton was, included with the lumped item,
“ Cost of quarrying,” in profit and loss account. Never-
theless, Prospect quarry land stood at £3925 4s. as at
December, 1908, and it stands at exactly the same to-day ;
and Guildford quarry land also remains at the old
£1330 7s. lid. Of course there may have been purchases
recentlv ; but, if not, and assuming the co. has been re-
moving' rock from these quarries, it looks as though it
has been eating up its capital. Possibly the same theory
applies to the other quarry land also. The supplies may
be huge ; but if they are drawn upon, their capital value
ought to be written down out of revenue, even though
the reduction may be very small in any one half-year.
The cash position has moved as follows :

Liabilities.. .. .. £7814 £8433 £7987
Liquid assets .. .. 2985 4940 4905
Excess liabilities .. £4829 £3493 £3082
It isn’t a very rapid movement, and not such a one as
would be expected from the growth of the reserves and
the considerable amounts that have been written off; the
explanation of the gradualness is that the co. has been
putting most of its savings into more quarry land and
plant, especially at Prospect and Guildford.

There are 50,000 shares of £2 10s. each in this co. ; 10s. is
paid, and the shareholders are liable for the other £2.
The paid capital and a trifle over is represented by public
securities; the reserves are represented mainly by the
co.’s premises (at cost, £15,962) and book debts. The
Equity is one of the old-fashioned trustee cos. which give
no more information about themselves than the law com-
pels them to; and that isn't much. Among other things,
it doesn’t tell the total value of the trust estates in hand ;
and without that information it isn’t possible to
say whether the reserves are adequate, or the ex-
penses reasonable. The trustee co. came into favor
because testators naturally couldn’t know much
about the private trustee—couldn’t know what his private
means were, or whether he was living inside his real
income, or whether in a dozen ways he was fit to be
trusted to handle your money when you were too dead to
watch him. The favorite plan of one type of family law-
yer who went in for this business was to surround himself
with an air of mystery—presumably to suggest that he
carried about tremendous secrets with him and could tell
wonderful things if he liked. It was mostly showman’s
humbug ; and yet there are trustee cos. which seem to
struggle after the same effect. However, the least satis-
factory of them have many advantages; the public
securities, the liability of the shareholders, the audit,
and a few other things are hard and obvious facts, even if
doubt spreads over much else like a vapor of pea-soup.

There are 50,000 shares fully paid to £1 and 25,000 shares
nominally paid to 10s. ; but £12,306, or practically the
whole of’the other 10s., has been “ paid in anticipation of
calls,” and the total amount paid carries the full divi-
dend. Some time ago it was stated that the other 10s.
would be formally called up ; it will be seen, though, that
that process would add practically nothing to the total
paid away in dividends. There are, however, a further
25,000 of unissued shares. The co. owes £B4lB to
depositors, as against £lO2 two years ago ; five years ago
the total was £10,075. The amount of the deposits moves
up and down with the advances. If pledges are unusually
plentiful, the co. raises the needful by accepting deposits.
The old rule was that the worse the times the more busi-
ness this co. did ; and if that rule still holds good, as it
ought to, it looks as though the normal amount of
advances has moved up considerably. Anyway, these are
not bad times, yet the advances are much higher than
they have been, as a rule : June, 1899, £76,827 ; June,
1903, £87,244 ; ditto, 1906, £82,449 ; 1909, £92,629. And
between 1899 and the present there has been practically
no increase of capital (£74,081 to £74,806). That
increased turnover looks, then, as though there
might be room for more capital. The question is
whether any new capital that might be got in could earn
its own 10 per cent, net, because there isn’t much surplus
profit at present to help it. Of course, the advances
bring in more than 10 per cent, gross ; but they don’t
bringin quite 10 per cent, net as a rule. The revenue is
about £l9 10s. per cent, of advances ; the expenditure
(excluding interest) a trifle over £lO per cent., leaving
£9 10s. per cent, profit. But as against that has to be set
the fact tnat expenses shouldn’t move up in proportion
to any increase there might be in capital ; and that being
so, provided always that the money could be used, it
would probably bring in a trifle more than 10 per cent.

The list opens with the co. paying- a2£p.c. div.; but prior
to 1898 it had paid nothing at all for five years. It was
the old trouble —more money advanced on properties
than they were worth in bad or even normal times,
followed by years of starvation for the co. while it used
its profits in making good the deficiency. In June, 1597,
there was a depreciation reserve of £8,434 ; as properties
were sold this was gradually drawn upon until in June,
1907, only £2,197 was left. In the next year a surplus
of £lll was realised, and last year £147, so that this
reserve stands now at £2,455. These surpluses have been
reckoned as profits in the table above. As the next com-
parison shows, there is still a good deal of property on
hand: —
1899. 1904. 1908. 1909.
Deposits .. .. £3,362 £10,978 £12,520 £15,699
Other liabilities .. 6,773 3,362 1,206 2,934
Advances .. .. 18,046 28,318 29,611 34,249
Properties (fore-
closures, etc.) .. 24,248 17,178 15,418 15,399
These properties show net under 3 percent.; so either
thev are still much over-valued or there is a lot of unpro-
ductive land amongst them. Fortunately the advances,
which are moving along steadily, are a much better pay-
ing lot. How they will turn out in the end, though,
depends on whether the valuations have been too high
during the recent burst of prosperity. The capital is
£25,623; so deposits and other liabilities are well pro-
tected. Some recent profits may no doubt have been
stuffed away somewhere, though there is no trace whatever
of that. At any rate, profits certainly should have gone
ahead faster than the list shows, considering the much
greater risks that the co. is now carrying. The co. will,
however, labor under a handicap until it can get rid of
some of its big load of unprofitable properties; yet if it
w'asn’t able.to do anything much with them in the past
three or four years, it isn’t likely to have better luck
in the next two or three years, now that the tide in
the coal trade is running out.

This co. was established 20 years ago to take over
the business of Richardson and Wrench, property valuers,
auctioneers, etc., the price paid for the goodwill being no
less than £57,500 of the total capital of £60,000. The
years 1888-9 were a time of inflated values and bloated
commissions ; and that accounts for the tremendous
price paid really for the mere righ t to use the names of
two men, both of them long since gone. Under the cir-
cumstances the management proceeded to do the best
thing'possible ; dividends have been kept at a reasonably
modest 5 per cent.—a lower rate might frighten off busi-
ness —and such stead}' additions have been made
to reserves that to-day, instead of having only
the paltry £2500 of substantial assets with which it
started, the co. has £25,176 ; and over a fourth
of that has been put by in the past three years.
Just over £25,000 is now apparently earning interest. If
that were made the foundation of a 4 per cent, sinking or
amortization fund, and if only 1500 a year could be added
to it out of the profits of the business, the w'hole £60,000
of capital could be accumulated inside 17 years. The
present tangible assets are equal to about Bs. 4d. pet-
share. Nearly all these assets are in Treasury bills and
bank deposits ; and the question will no doubt arise
w'hether a co. carrying on a commission business of this
sort gains anything much by keeping a large amount of
money earning so low a rate of interest. If that view is
taken, there may later on be a division of assets, and a
reduction of capital.

Out of its silver-lead concentrates the co. made £42,763,
and £4032 w-as received on account of sales of zinc tail-
ings. From the total of £46,795 the co. wrote off £10,742
for depreciation. The zinc tailings actually produced
totalled 41,563 tons. The De Bavay Co. has made a con-
tract with the South to build a zinc mill, pay the co.
3s. 6d. per ton, and halve any profits over 3s. 6d. per ton.
That is to say, suppose the De Bavay Co. sells its zinc
concentrates at the rate of 275. per ton of tailings, and
suppose the costs are 18s. Then (1) the South gets 3s. 6d.
in any case; (2) the De Bavay Co. pays its costs, 18s.;
(3) it takes 3s. 6d. for itself; (4) it divides the other 2s.
equally • between itself and the South. Until the new
null is ready the De Bavay Co. is t dung- the tailings at
3s. 9d. per ton ; so the gross profit on the half-year’s
output was equal to—
Concentrates ~ .. .. £42,763
Zinc tailings 7793
Total .. .. £50,556
The quantity of lead contained in the concentrates was
15,268 tons. Thus the true gross profit (£50,556) was
equal to £3 6s. 3d. per ton of lead ; and as lead averaged
£l3 ss. 4d. per ton for the half-year, the cost price of the
co.’s lead was £9 19s. Id. per ton. In other words, on
last half-year’s figures, it takes all the silver, all the zinc
product, and £9 19s. Id. per ton of lead to pay costs with-
out allowing anything for depreciation of plant, but
charging all mining expenditure up to costs.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating- mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
With the best soiid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. \V. and J.

The Callow Revolving Band Screen gives
promise of revolutionising the system of ore classification
in Australia, as it has already done in America, for all
classes and conditions of concentrating ores, with vastly
improved extraction in the mills. At Broken Hill it has
been especially successful. It is an unqualified success as a
fine wet screen, and this is what all the mining world has
been seeking; it is also equally effective on the coarse rafts
from Cornish Rolls. With it there is no excessive wear, no
clogging of the mesh ; it has an enormous capacity and a
small water consumption. The fundamental principle of
this machine is a travelling band or belt of screen cloth
stretched on a drum over which the ore and its carrying
water is spread by means of a distributing apron of
special design. The drum passes over rollers, and the
belt is caused to revolve continuously at a speed adapted
to the nature and quantity of the material to be screened.
The machine is fully protected by patent rights. For
further particulars apply to the Austral Otis Engineering
Co., of Hanna Street, South Melbourne. This firm are the

ance for depreciation, last half-year’s ore was worth
7s. 4d. per ton ; allowing for depreciation (which means
the replacement of machinery) it was worth ss. 9d. per
ton. At £l6 i*sjvould be worth 11s. lid. per ton,
allowing the same depreciation. In the one case the
3,250,000 tons would be worth in net profit £934,375 ; in
the other, £1,936,500. Yet the South is called an invest-
ment. Certainly, if the shares (200,000) are bought when
lead is having one of its periodical slumps, the buyer is
pretty certain to make a good deal of money if he hangs
on ; and if he buys when the market is about normal, he
is likely to get a fair return. The question is : When is
the lead-market normal ? Tins Bulletin doesn’t know.
Besides the B. H. South ore talked of above,
there are over 1,000,000 tons of accumulated tailings and
slimes, which may be worth anything up to a quarter of
a million—it depends on the price of spelter and the
future development of the metallurgy of zinc.

A year or so ago a small amount of capital was forfeited ;
and now it has been most improperly taken into profit
and loss account, and is actually included in the “ net
profit on half-year’s operations ” shown in the balance-
sheet. No div. was paid six months ago, so the present
distribution is equal to 6 per cent, for the year. The
depreciation is at the rate of 7£ per cent, on fixed assets,
which probably is not enough. The financial position
has much improved in the last few years. Liabilities
total £3532 ; and besides plant and stocks, the co. lias
£3085 of cash and upwards of £l9OO of book debts.

A.,T.S. Bank.—The long negotiations between
the directors and the British depositors have been con-
cluded; and the result is that a considerably modi-
fied scheme has be n agreed upon, This provides
for the old deposits being disposed of in this
way :—-2s. 6d. in the £ payable in two years,
ss. in the £ to be converted into ordinary shares of
the new bank, and 10s. in the £tobe represented by 4 per
cent, inscribed deposits redeemable out of a sinking fund.
This differs from the original scheme in these respects :
(l)2s. 6d. is now to be written off; (2) no preference
shares are to be issued ; (3) the inscribed stock or deposits
carry 4 per cent, instead of 3 per cent, (rising to 4 per
cent, in a certain event); (4) provision is to be made fora
sinking fund for the repayment of the new inscribed
deposits.
Then as to the shareholders in the old A.J.S.
Bank. The original scheme was that the £1 paid up per
share at present should be written off, and that
the other £2 10s. should be called up. The scheme
agreed upon by the British depositors—and adopted
by the bank’s directors—provides that 255. of the
£2 10s. to be called up shall also be written off. On the
other hand, there are to be no preference shares, and to
that extent the old shareholders gain very considerably.
Mention is made above of a sinking fund. This
is to be at the rate of £15,000 half-yearly, to commence in
two years after the new bank starts ; but this fund is not
necessarily to be provided out of profits. The retirement
of the deposits is to be as the directors may determine.
The general effect of the scheme will be as
follows :
Written Off.
Present capital £155,000
255. per share (to be called up) .. 193,750
2s. 6d. in the £ of old deposits.. .. 469,000
Total .. ... £817,750
The old bank advances now total £1,882,570; premises,
£367,693 ; total, £2,250,263. All these assets can there-
fore be written down on the average nearly 7s. 6d. in the
£. Provided the new business is good, this ought to be
a thorough cleaning-up, and from this point of view the
new scheme is much better than ftie original one.
The capital of the new bank under the new
scheme will be approximately £1,131,000, all in ordinary
shares. Five per cent, on that would mean £56,550. The
4 per cent, on the inscribed deposits will call for £75,000
a year for a start (it will be reduced as the sinking fund
gets to work). Total of the two, £131,550. The old
deposits have recently cost the bank about £117,000
a year; and the disclosed profits for the past
12 months were £29,434. Total of these two, £146,434'.
It would seem from that as though, in addition to the 4
per cent, interest on inscribed deposits, a 5 per cent. div.
could be paid at once, leaving £14,854 a year over
for reserves. But then there is the\2s. Od. in the
£ to be paid back in two years, meantime carrying-
interest. This repayment should not, however, cause any
trouble ; in the first place, £387,500 of new capital is to
be got in, of which half will be written off, and in
the second place the bank has at present an
unnecessarily large holding of coin and other
liquid assets earning nothing or but very little.
The earnings from these and other sources should pay
interest on the two-year deposit. It is highly probable
therefore that the new shares will stand at par or not far
short of it.

Rumors have been flying around about the
Broken Hill Junction North shaft. This shaft is never
very far from disaster, but it may hold out all right. At
present it is as safe as it has been for two or three years.
The mill is really in a more rotten state than the shaft.
It is being improved by degrees, but so slowly that it is a
wonder any good results can be got from it at all. The
air compressor Was not renewed till the old one was
literally falling to pieces, and that’s the way of things in
general.

The ISlorth is about the quietest and most con-
sistent plodder along the Broken Hill lode. Its new
4000-ton mill has arisen almost as silently as a mushroom,
and the first section was ready for its trial run almost
before the directors themselves knew about it. This new
mill is well situated on the slope of a hill, with the haul-
ing shaft only a few yards away from the mill bins.
Everything is compact and economically arranged, and
if good work is not accomplished—well, the office cat will
have to be poisoned.

The recent fall in lead took a lot of money out
of the pockets of the South Blocks and the Zinc Corpora-
tion. The latter had stored about 2600 tons of lead con-
centrates, containing about 1469 tons lead, awaiting the
end of the Broken Hill industrial trouble. Had the
B. H. Prop, taken delivery before the end of June, an
average of £l3 ss. would have been got for the lead. But
before the Zinc Corporation had begun to get the lead
off its hands, the slump had taken place, and the July
average had fallen to £l2 13s, 3d., with a much lower
price since. The South Blocks Co. is worse off still. It
had about 11,000 tons of concentrates stacked on the
mine waiting for the smelters to start; so the co. is about
£5OOO worse off than it reckoned.

Kyloe, in the Monaro (N.S.W.), gives every
promise of rooting out some of the objections to that
part of the country as a mining field. There is practically
no outcrop on the property ; but a lens of ore was traced
down in an old shaft by the original owner, Reynolds. At
300 ft. the co. followed it in a north drive about 110 ft.,
when it became poor ; and on the south side for about
115 ft., when the same thing happened. The lens of rich
ore occurs in the lode ; sometimes it is the full width—up
to 10ft.—and sometimes only an inch or two. The
drive is irregular in width ; if the rich ore bulges
it has all been taken out, and in one or two
places a little has been taken down from above ; but,
practically in driving only for 259 ft. on this level, 717
tons averaging 15'5 per cent, was won. Both the north
and south drives are being continued. The north is now
out 266 ft.; they are still on lode, but at present it is
worth only I's to 10 per cent., and from the last 12ft.
only. 15 tons of s'l per cent, ore have been picked out.
This is for the mill, which will be ready in a few weeks.
It appears to be a good concentrating ore, and yet, as it
is a small make, and as freight, etc., is heavy, it is very 7
doubtful whether anything less than from 4£ to 5 per cent,
ore will pay. South, the drive is out 320 ft. ; there is
lode still in the face, but it is too poor to do anything
with. The drives are apparently being continued in the
hope of picking up another lens. Dr. Jack was through
the mine last month, and expected to find a new
lens making in the north drive; and there have
been signs of it lately. The No. 4 level, 100 ft. deeper,
is now being explored; the north drive is out
84ft. and the south 94ft. Last week the one (worked in
the same way as the No. 3) gave 32 tons of 22'3per cent,
ore for 13ft. of driving ; the other gave 23 tons of 14 per
cent, for 9ft. of driving. Some winzes have been put
down from No. 3; and there is practically no doubt at
all that the ore continues between the two levels. The
lode looks permanent; but how far the lens of rich ore will
last down is another matter. It is just as liable to cut
out as other lenses are to come in—and vice vena. The
management is cautious, and its published figures are
not of the boom type. For over 12 months a small fur-
nace has been running almost without a break, turning
out from 10 to 12 tons copper a week ; and probably this
will be continued, though it is very doubtful whether it
will pay the co. to put up larger works on the spot to
smelt either the richer ore or the concentrates. For one
thing the mine is not well placed for fluxes.
» * * •
A crushing plant has been put up on the old
Mount Dromedary (N.S. VV.), and from one of the many
tunnels ore is being paddocked for a first crushing. The
Mount Dromedary Co. worked the mine for more than 10
years, employing at times 80 miners; but it was only a
tucker claim, and even to pay tucker the eyes had to be
picked out. Still, the faith of the miner is strong, and
the new co. thinks there is an eye or two left.
* * * *
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) is raising £lOO,OOO
by 6 per cent, debentures to enlarge and remodel the
surface plant. This is the third time the co. has
tried this way of financing. It did so when money 7 was
wanted for the purchase and erection of the second 50
head of stamps, and again when the installation of the
third 50 head was decided on.
■**■•** *•
Tindal’s (W.A.) has struck another sixpenny
call. This makes the third since immediate dividends
were promised, and, as usual, some yarn about
“rich assays” preceded the announcement. The
co. still has about Is. 3d. per share to call
up, after which it will have to show' that the
mine is a visible means of support, or risk being run-
in under the Vag. Act. Meanwhile, the machinery man
is getting most of the money wrung from share-
holders, and the mill is doing its best to pay wages and
directors’ exes, etc. The officials’ position is all
right ; the shareholders’ is all wrong. Certainly 7 regular
crushings are being obtained, but the returns might just
as well be dross for all the good they are to the people
who are finding the money to equip the property.
* •* . * fr
Coolgardie Redemption (W.A.) is again trying
to raise the wind. This time 150,000 preference shares
are being- offered to the public at ljd. on application,
ljd. on allotment, and the balance in penny calls. Local
opinion has veered round to the belief that the property
is a bag of tricks, and this may prevent people from
applying for the new scrip.

To try to make public smelting pay in
Westralia a new co., st.vled the Fremantle Smelt-
ing and Mining Co., Ltd., has been formed in
London to take over the business lately 7 carried on
by the Fremantle Smelter, Ltd. Latter concern took
over the assets and effects of the Fremantle Smelt-
ing Works, Ltd., in 1903, but after four lean years it gave up
business and paid shareholders 13s. in the £. Altogether
four cos. have had a gi« at the Fremantle smelter since the
late W. J. Kohler laid it down 12 or 15 years ago.

From Meekatharra (W.A.) : Practically all the
gold-bearing reefs are situated in an area a quarter of a
mile wide by 7 a mile and a half long. On the northern end
of the belt is the Pioneer, held at present by Hans Irvine,
under eight months’-working option. The purchase price
is fixed at £9OOO. This was the first lease taken up on
Meekatharra, 14 years ago. It was purchased by the
Darlot Exploration Syndicate for £3OOO ; but after
spending £lOOO or so, mostly in pig-rooting, this
crowd threw it up. Recently a party of working
men explored Darlot’s old workings and got such
prospects that they set to work on it. The
lease was then held by a local man from whom they 7
bought it, on bills, for £3700. The first crushing, 300 tons,
paid two-thirds of the purchase price. At present 400
tons are going through the State mill, and ought to be
worth close-up 2oz. Irvine has cut the reef at 180 ft. ;it
is white quartz, showing gold, and is 10ft. wide. At the
southern end of the belt is the Fenian, which is fast
making its few lucky 7 shareholders wealthy 7 men. The
reef, though small, and extremely erratic, is of high
value ; and the mine has got almost into the habit of
cleaning up 1300 oz. per month, and paying £2OOO in divs.
The shaft is down 600 ft., and dividends can be looked
forward to for about two years on ore in sight. Roberts
Bros’, mine, to the north of the Fenian, produces 400 oz.
per month with a five-head mill ; while the Marmont, to
the south of the Fenian, is clearing over £lOOO a month.

Who that remembers the “ good old days” in
Victoria has forgotten the fair-haired Miss Cornwall, who
fathered the Madame Midas, out towards Sulky Gully ? A
London float was tried, but didn’t take on, and the show
petered out with the exhaustion of the alluvial. Still,
old memories live, and one J. VV. Tank has succeeded
where Madame Midas failed. J. Bull is to put up work-
ing capital of £40,000, out of subscribed capital of
£lOO,OOO, for the property; so there should be
enough cash to give the mine a show. Quartz
is the objective this time, the idea being to
deepen one of the old Midas shafts, and crosscut
for some of the reefs intersected in the old main levels of
the alluvial workings. Area is a consideration when J.
Bull’s purse is appealed to, so nearly 1600 acres have been
pegged out, from Sulky Gully on to Creswick. A lot may
happen in 1600 acres if you have the cash to spare. That
is the best and the worst that can be said about the
Midas float. To strike a good reef would be a boon and
a blessing to a district which for a quarter of a century
has been classed among the mining has-beens. Alec
Peacock, of course, is on the Board, with his brother
Henry as legal manager.

Johnson’s Reef, Bendigo, finishes the half-year
with no debt, but with durned little cash to talk about.
Still there are lots of prospects and some gold up at the
No. 2 mine to carry on with till work on the Collmann
and Tacchi boundary tells whether the shoot of gold lives
north of Collmann’s fault! But for Johnson’s to be out
of debt! Think of that, after call-making and call-paying
for nine years! Since New Year’s Day, with the aid of
gold £11,709, calls £1323, and customs crushing £1492,
the debt of £5300 has disappeared. Public crushing
is an item that reads badly. Why cannot Johnson’s, out
of its three mines, keep all its stampers going on its
Own stone ? The only answer is that Bendigo won’t work
on that plan. When profits come divs. have to be paid,
and so development is never far enough ahead of the
battery. If Johnson’s hits good stone at the 1642 ft.,
look out for a jump ! So far the most to be said is that
prospects are encouraging.

Another' of the British deep lead shows, the
Charlotte Plains, Carisbrook (Vic.), is struggling with
adversity. This is Drysdale Brown’s claim low down on
the Majorca lead ; next door, but higher up the street, is
8,, M. and Co.’s Victorian Deep Leads, Charlotte
Plains had a big slab of glacial deposit in
its territory, and experts differed as to whether
gold lived there, Capron, its old manager, always wanted
to go north to the Silurian, but want of cash and excess
of water stopped that. One Kentish faihily backed the
mine to the tune of a hundred thousand. Then, when
the last reconstruction had to be faced, they cut their
loss. H. H. Schlapp and a few others since then have
trodden modestly in that family’s footsteps. They too
look as if they had had enough. There remain two shafts,
a splendid plant, a central power-station, and a heap
of disappointed hopes. The corner of Victoria which in-
cludes the Charlotte, Junction Deep, Victorian Beep
Leads, Moolort and Loddon Valley mines has cost John
Bull a long way over a million, and he has only won
enough gold to pay directors’ train fareg.
* * * *
Ajax, Daylesford (Vic.), with a div. and a bonus
of Is. each, has now paid £54,750, It has about £9OO
cash in hand, and the plates to scrape, The value of the
stone known to be in the mine is, at the most, 255. ; so
that the market adds 7s. for prospects. What Ajax needs
is gold at the bottom level. Till that is got the mine is a
wasting proposition ; so it is not to the credit of the
directors that they have not got an odd £5OOO as areserve
to help them face the time when they’ll have to sink or
burst.
* * * *
Tewksbury Amalgamated, the co. which
gathered four or five Bright (Vic.) dredging .claims
under its wing, has had a rather unsatisfactory half-
year. The record of earnings after paying all
working and office expenses has been: June, 190 S,
£10,277 ; Dec., 1908, £10,382 ; June, 1909, £4864. Deduct
income tax, and the past half-year’s profit is reduced to
£4703, from-which £731 is written off for depreciation of
plant. But this co. goes further than that: it rightly holds
that the gold-dredging lands ought to be written down to
nothing as the dredges eat them up ; so for the past half-
year it writes off £1756. Total cost of land was £42,616 ;
so far £6155 of this has been written off out of receipts.
As the property is written down capital is paid back ; of
the capital of £66,500, £3325 has so far been returned,
including £llOB for the past half-year = 4d. in the £.
The dividend was Bd. (£2216). The co. works all the
ground, and it has so happened that four out of the five
dredges have been in poor patches ; but yields have
lately improved. Working costs have also been a bit
higher—l'7sBd. per cubic yard as against l - 695d. in the
previous half-year, when No. 1 dredge made the remark-
able record of 1’362d.

New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers,
crushed 393 tons for £2061; and the previous return (for
a month) was £4629 from 840 tons. As this is over £5 per
ton, it should mean substantial profits now that some of
the stone can be hauled up the N.B.F. shaft, and crushed
at the D. D. Block and Wyndham mill, of which the co. is
part-owner. Shares have been boomed up to 305., which
gives the mine a market value of £225,000 —a merry pace
for a show that lingers over paying its maiden dividend.
But Charters Towers remembers Mills’ United, and san-
guine people expect N.B.F. to repeat the history of the
Day Dawn : and, besides, there is a whisper that “ London
is buying,” and is “ good ” for £2. The weak way No. 2
East is officially spoken of as having sft. of “crushing
stuff” in the face, after passing through disturbed
country, hardly sustains the hope that No. 2 is going to
turn out so well as No. 1 did ; and even No. 1, after it
passed 500 ft. from the boundary, proved erratic. Now
No. 2 will soon be 500 ft. east too, and things will then
have to be watched.
* * * *
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, will test the
strength of the stock’s hold on the market when the
return from 200 tons of stone is announced. The manage-
ment is driving west on the reef and sinking the under-
lay. Brilliant didn’t strike the Deeps’ formation in the
crosscut, and will therefore do, some diamond drilling.
The sinking of two deep shafts for the one objective—the
Day Dawn —shows the faith of mining men in a theory
which mainly depends on the fact that the Day Dawn,
with many breaks, has held its course over a great length
and down to a great depth. The Brilliant reef no doubt
showed persistence ; but ultimately it reached a poor
western zone in the N. B. Freeholds and East Mexican.
Whether the Day Dawn as it goes east through the N.B.F.
and Mexican will become poor too has not been fully
proved. The fact that the original Day Dawn P.C. reef
was of very limited extent going east is an illustration
that every shoot of golden stone must end somewhere.
Mount Morgan has been doing a lot of develop-
ment work under agreement with the Many Peaks. The
co. which owns the latter has declared two dividends,
totalling £5612, according to the warden’s report; so the
leviathan doesn’t take everything. It wanted to take a
good deal more; and that was one of the things over
which General-Manager Richard and ex-Mine-Manager
Bowie Wilson split. Wilson was in the Many Peaks
syndicate which offered the thing to Mou,nt Morgan.
Oapt. Richard reckoned that it wasn’t any use without
Mount Morgan, and decided to wait. The syndicate said
that if he did wait the price would go up—and it did,
which naturally annoyed the general manager, where-
upon trouble started. However, even now, Mount
Morgan has a fine bargain. The ore body has proved to
be 100 ft. wide in places, and reserves are counted at
840,000 tons. The ore is of good quality considered as a
flux, for it contains very little silica.* The gold and
copper contents are expected to pay all costs of mining,
transport, etc. ; and it is expected that the sulphur in
the ore will also reduce the coke bill.
* * * *
The Mount Molloy (N.Q.) now hangs its hopes
mainly on the Anniversary, at Herberton, in which it has
a controlling interest. Its own developments have been
poor, though a few small patches have been found ; and
until something is done to reduce the freights from North
Queensland to the South there isn’t likely to be anything
in the co.’s timber concession and mill. The. Anniversary
may, however, pull it some of the way out of the bog.
That mine, though its workings are certainly only shallow
so far (the deepest shaft is about 100 ft.), has Opened up
very well indeed ; and 2000 tons of basic ore will shortly
go down to the Molloy smelter. Molloy itself has a good
quantity of silicious ore which, though worth up to 10 per
cent., wasn’t profitable when handled on its own ; but
with the Anniversary’s basic ore to help it through, there
ought to be good profit in both, while the Molloy’s ore
lasts. The Anniversary’s lode seems to average about sft.
* * * *
“ Melilla ” : Georgetown (Q.) has a ray of hope at
last. The ray is the discovery of 2ft. of gold-bearing
•quartz, good for 20z., on the St. George line of reef. For
ages this place, as well as innumerable others, has been
locked up ; but the ground “ went ” lately, and a Clon-
curry crowd secured a claim and started work. Had the
Mines Department done its duty, and forfeited leases for
non-working, the development might have occurred long
ago. Also, in that case Georgetown might have had the
railway it has asked for and been refused.
* * * *
A brief funeral service was read ov§r 120 wild
cats and kittens in North Queensland lately. The Her-
berton warden notified the forfeiture of that many leases
for failure to pay the rent for 1909, and a little later on
the Chillagoe warden is to conduct a similar service.
The Endeavor and Leslie, Dalziel’s Great Boulder, a batch
round the Tommy Burns, Weinert’s East Orient, and a
host of private cats as well as public ones are included.

Recent coal discoveries in South Gippsland
(Victoria) promise that the whole of the district which
got its first rise at Korumburra, and it's next rises at
Jumbunna andOuttrim, will be converted into a Victorian
“ black country.” There’s a vast coal basin in S. Gipps-
land, of which the early discoverers had only the vaguest
suspicion. Just now a diamond drill is boring for a coal
deposit within 2& miles of Inverloeh, and already the
possibilities of Anderson’s Inlet for harbor purposes are
being discussed in the Public Works Department. Seem-
ingly the discovery of a mine at this new drilling ground
is almost a foregone conclusion, and, anyway, there is at
last a commercial future for poor old Inverloeh. It is the
place Where L. J. Lohr went and buried himself when he
retired from theatrical business years ago on the strength
of “ What Happened to Jones.” He took a local pub,
and rebuilt it, and waited for something to happen te
Lohr. Now the coal developments are happening:* and
two or three kind and thoughtful syndicates have
approached the burly boniface with liberal offers to take
his hotel off his hands. But Lohr, meanwhile, is content
to note the rising- value Of his “joint” in what he Calls
the “ coming Cardiff of Australia.” There’s the true ting
of the old showman in that term —“ the coming Cardiff,”

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, August 17, 1909.
My Drar Arini,—
Since writing my penultimate letter, your
Akenehi has been at the Hotel Kosciusko.
Four thunderclouds hung over the railing of
the fishing-box known as The Creel. A few
minutes previously we would have described our-
selves as four fairly cheerful, able-bodied young
women. But when Dr. Pockley, standing in a
mud-bespattered motor, and biting ravenously
into an apple, advised us not to attempt the rest
of the journey to Kosciusko, we must have
looked a good imitation of clouds that
had no silver lining. The doctor spoke with
authority as one who had just braved the
battle and the blizzard. We had railed all
night from Sydney to Cooma, and we had
motored 41 muddy miles from Cooma to The
Creel, to be told that it would be madness to
attempt to get through for “the next three or four
days.” The speaker again bit hungrily into the
apple, the chauffur cranked up and the motor
chug-chugged away through the mud towards
Cooma.
Arrived some hours later a long, lean, tough
young man. “ Tough, sir, tough and devilish sly,”
as Joey Bagstock says in “ Dombey and Son.”
He was an official of the Tourist Department,
and “he had got through.” That was the ex-
clamation from many quarters. He certainly
looked as if he had “ got through ” some terrify-
ing weather conditions ; but we had no sympathy
for any but ourselves. When he spoke of 25ft. of
snow on the road, and a blizzard performing like
a lion away up the mountain, we said, “ You have
come that road ; we will go that road.” He smiled
superiorwise the smile that says, “I Am A Man,”
and emptied the snow-water out of his gum
boots. Night came down on The Creel and the
Thredbo River, and we four sat on a rug in front
of a fire of tree trunks and abused the Tourist De-
partment. Providence might have been listening,
and as He always has the inside running we were
afraid to abuse Him.
At breakfast we again confronted the Tourist
official. He was entrenched behind a trough of
tea. With tears dimming his spectacles, he again
feared we dare not attempt to “get through.”
Our quartettish frown deepened like a pinewood’s
shadow when the wintry sun goes down. His
nerve so went to pieces that he gave the black
retriever his poached egg and ate a dog
biscuit himself. Skipping the account of the
ensuing pourparler, an hour later (about 9.30)
saw us on our hilly way in the coach. The
official was with us, and a very present help in
time of need we found him. The horses appeared
to be shod with white marble, and to be wearing
lambswool gaiters to their knees. Snow! I
must skip several miles of snow. When the
coach was well over its axles in a drift, and
unable to go another yard, the sleigh slid up,
drawn by two horses. It brought us gum-boots
and snow-shoes from the hotel. We got into the
gums, but the long strange timber things soon
tired us, and we preferred to flounder along on
plain foot.
From the coach a quantity of belated (pas-
sengers’) luggage and bags of horse feed had been
transferred to the sleigh, and at intervals we four
perched ourselves on suit cases or horse fodder,
and travelled so awhile in joyous precariousness.
Whenever one of us rolled off in a graceless hurry
into a drift another would jump off, camera in
hand, crying, “Don’t move! Stop where you
are ! Oh, you do look a sight ! ” This was the
playful and comic part of the journey. The day
was grey and fairly warm, and we could not realise
the epic time a few miles ahead of us.
Early in the afternoon we reached the road-
gang’s camp. It consisted of a tent with snow
banked high around it. A light snow was whirl-
ing in a wet, cold wind, and the atmosphere was
cobweb-hued. We were compelled to use the
snow-shoes, and our foolish laughter and flippant
recitals of horrible Alpine accidents were hushed,
for we wanted all our lung power to do battle
with the central blizzard. This was only its van.
At the camp the men compressed snow into a
billy and presently gave us tea. A pretty slate-
blue bird, nearly as big as a pigeon, flew out
of the tent as we went in. Its wings drooped
and its bill was chattering. Whilst we
were still teaing the bird looked in once, and I
think pity for it hurried our departure. Birds
migrate from here in the winter, and this
last bird of summer set us speculating as we
threw biscuits to the camp dogs. Friendly dogs
they were, their coats covered with snowflakes
from nose to tail-tip.
A small army of men came on with us to make
an open track for the sleigh, they hurrying ahead,
and ourselves walking behind. At one part of
the descent to the hotel 24 feet of snow
blocked the road. Through this the road
gang shovelled a way, and as fast as
they shovelled the snow the furious wind
blew it back. Now that the struggle is one
with the snows of yesteryear, it is gratifying to
think that we struck not only a real blizzard but
the record one. None of us four had ever been
previously blizzed upon. Blinding, whirling
snow, rain that stung like cherry-stones fired from
a catapult, cold that froze our motor-veils to our
purple cheeks and red noses and hung icicles on
to the men’s moustaches and eyebrows, and a wind
that thrust and buffeted us as if we were standing
corn, and made us struggle and gasp for breath
like drowning swimmers. Now I realise some-
what of the Erl King’s ride, and the journey
of the youth who carried the banner with the
strange device, “Up’ards,” into the Alpine
heights. Also the Tennysonian “Oriana”—
“ When the long dun wolds are ribbed with snow,
and loud the Norland whirlwinds blows”—lies
clear before me. It is all a glorious memory, and
we wouldn’t part with it for any money. We
reached the hotel at nightfall.
Next morning the heavens were telling the
glory of God in another key. From a cloudless
sky like liquid turquoise a warm sun shone
upon a world buried as under diamond dust.
The snow glittered like powdered gems, and
through the blinding white of the surface reared
the sullen green of the scrub gums. “Where is
the cold?” we asked as we dressed with our
windows open. Snow many feet deep covered
the hotel roofs. Beautiful icicles, like ribbed
swords, hung from the verandahs, and just out-
side my bedroom window was a row of stalagmites
pretending to be cannon pointing inward. The
hotel was full, and the guests never seemed to
weary of tobogganing and skiing. Deep drifts
covered the frozen surface of the lake, and when
after some days’ labor the snow was shovelled
the ice proved “ rather ribby for skating.” But
that didn’t stop enthusiasts from going on it even
at night when the glass was down to twenty
degrees. Curiously enough we didn’t feel Kos-
ciusko much colder than Sydney, and out of doors
the fewer the clothes the happier the wearer.
Slopes innumerable, of all grades of steepness
and all lengths, lure the tourist to tobogganing
and skiing. Personally, I have not sufficient low
cunning to ski successfully, though my friends got
to be very good at it. But I tobogged like
lightning slipping on ice. Anybody may
tobog right off. But no matter how often
I did it I was sure that I was rushing this
time head downward into Eternity. A lady who
has been at Kosciusko for some months with her
two little sons'told me that every time she skis or
tobogs the conviction assails her when at mid-
speed : “ This is the end of all.” Then “ O, what
a pity, for I would have liked to live to see the
boys grow up.” When we left the snowlands, at
the end of last week, the roads were in capital
condition for coach and motor right from the hotel
to Cooma. As the coach rolled through the
blizzard-blown pass of a week previous we saw it
as the Marble Corridor, for so tourists have named
it. It was as rough-hewn marble, its walls about
level with the coach roof. Next week I’ll tell you
something about snowburn on the complexion.
Also something about frocking for the snow and
—legs. Leg-shows are as much at a discount up
there as they are in the ballet. Then there’s
billy tea made of snow water. Would that life
were all billy tea and tobogganing !
A rumor reaches me that in race-week the aides
of Governor-General Dudley intend to give a
dance to their Sydney friends. The G.-G. will
lend them his residence for the occasion, but all
else will be their own affair absolutely.
Mrs. Knox Gilmer la daughter of the late
Richard Seddon) got into this city per medium of
the Atua last week. She and an ailing ma-in-law
and a crowd of tourists have been doing the
Islands trip and taking on board an incredible
number of bunches of bananas. If you want to
be really rude to the Atua’s passengers, say
“bananas” suddenly in their presence. Mrs.
Gilmer’s youngest sister, Ruby, has been—so I
see by the watchful press—bending her spine
before royalty in London. The Joseph Wards
and daughter, who have done that bend frequently
in the past, will soon be on their way back to
Maoriland. Another returner, on his way by the
American route, is Mr. Owen Cox.
Miss Grace Watson, that vital little confer-
encer and creator of the “Mrs. Smith” spook,
has fallen on evil health in Brisbane, and has, in
consequence, been out of most of the whirpool of
discussion. She remains awhile in the jacaranda
capital after the close of the great interlocution,
for the purpose of picking up strayed vitality and
some paw-paws.
The secretaries of the Carnival Ball in aid of
the R.P.A.H. Nurses’ Home (Mesdames J. G.
Sheridan and Rennie and Miss Le Patourel)
have earned the right to lift their voices in the
Glory Song. That is the Glory to Ourselves
Song, understood. There was only one fly in the
honey—there always is one, and sometimes it is a
blue-bottle. But this fly was of the tiniest.
Dancing proper did not begin until 10 o’clock on
account of the manceuvrings of the miniature
army of fancy setters, under Field-Marshal Mrs.
Farmer who had drilled her subordinates the
previous day.
First in the long procession came the
“ Jewel Set,” headed by our leading civic dame
Allen Taylor and Dean-of-the-Faculty Anderson
Stuart, who led the movements of “form fours,
right and left wheel, eight abreast and single
file,” in quite professional style. The frocks
in this set were of black velvet trimmed with
diamonds—some thousands of pounds’ worth lent
by a Sydney firm. (If Mayoress Taylor would
look her best every time, she should wear black vel-
vet and £lO,OOO worth of white sparklers.) Then
there was the “ Hunting Set,” with its good-look-
ing women in scarlet coats, black satin skirts,
three-cornered hats and white wigs, with men to
match. Next a set of ministering angels in uni-
form, and the youthful resident doctors in their
indoor garb of white linen and black velvet caps
(which, by the way, are worn to distinguish the
full-fledged doctor from the student who is walk-
ing the hospitals), looking like Pierrots minus their
whitewash. Two most effective sets were “Night,”
in black, with astronomical decorations, and in
the hair the black bat that Newbury sings of to
Maud in the Garden, and “ The Ladies’ Field ”
gowned like the girl on the cover of that paper.
Behind them, bacchantes, with vine-leaves in their
hair and the fruit of the vine on their frocks,
represented “Penfold’s Australian Wines.” A
striking set, representative of Whitelaw’s wall-
papers, wore frocks of paper adorned with quaint
nursery figures, preceded by a handsome little
herald. Next came a bunch of “Roses” in pink ;
a wall-paper and billiard-requisites set (Sher-
woods and Alcock’s); girls in court-trained white
satin decked with Australian gems (A. Saunders);
and a set of black and white “Dominoes,”
which disguised several prominent Pointers.
On their heels came some early Romans
with Julius Superfluous limbs, and dark-eyed
bejewelled Egyptians. A Mrs. Teddy Bear, with
a Teddy bearlet in her arms, tried to get a bite
off a huge loaf of somebody’s bread, and to poke
a nose into a hive where biz hummed. “Bens-
dorp’s Cocoa,” wearing real Dutch costumes from
the land of the new' baby Juliana, mixed w’ith a
“ Box of Bonbons.” A scintillating Romeo walked
near some Tooth Paste which was making eyes at
a poster housemaid in blue and green. A petite
figure came down the hall in All Black even
to a Mephistophelian cap, and I thought the
printer’s imp was on my trail; but a silver quill
in the cap proclaimed that she was only a repre-
sentative of the legacy Dr. Danysz left as a warn-
ing to bunnies. Then I saw a rather attractive
girl in pink and black, and spoke to her ; but as
she didn’t respond I put her down as something
from the Deaf and Dumb home. Wrong again.
She was a “walking lady” in wax from a big
dress establishment, and a nasty man had her on
a string, and only w'hen he pressed the button did
the figure walk.
A sword and rose dance by the pupils of Mrs.
Boult, headed by Miss May Summerbelle, who had
also written the music, was executed most grace-
fully in 18th century costumes, the girls bearing
garlands of roses and the girl-men treading the
measure with drawn or sheathed swords. A batch
of children did a minuet, and a couple of girls
waved yards and yards of silk in the electric-
lighted air while the band played giddy music.
Peeress Chelmsford’s frock was of demure grey,
and her ornaments were corals and diamonds ;
and the Admiralty lady, who always seems to
enjoy herself, looked nice in white satin and some
more diamonds.
The sets were all exceedingly well carried out,
and at half-time Professor Anderson Stuart pro-
claimed that pieces of silverware would become
the property of the promoter of the “Jewel Set,”
as first in the advertising poster department, and
of the “Hunting Set” as first in the fancy de-
partment. An innovation, which might well be
carried out at all charity balls, was the arrange-
ment of a light supper all the evening, and no sit-
down meal. This saved much crowding, tearing
of frocks and loss of tempers and partners.
Lieutenant Frederick McQuade has resigned
from his regiment and rejoined his wife, Miss
Betty Ohls. The devoted brace leaves for
America, the bride’s own country, by the Chry-
santhemum liner.
Miss Deomar Lee, of Bathurst, will be married
to Rev. O’Breznan Ball, who cures souls in the
neighborhood of that western city, early next
month. The Lees have pervaded Bathurst
ever since it was on the map, and among
them they own many flocks and acres there
or thereabouts. Their strong suit is sport,
and the Lee male or female who is unacquainted
with the points of a racehorse has yet to be
unearthed. The bride-to-be is the only remaining
unmarried daughter of Hon. George Lee, of Lee-
holine, and the wedding will transpire at Holy
Trinity Church, Kelso, which impresses on all
who worship at it the fact that it is “the oldest
church west of the Blue Mountains.”
Society ran.with willing feet, or rushed in
motors, cabs, trams and carriages to the Glaci-
arium on Saturday night to see Miss Dorothy
Gordon give an exhibition of plain, frilled and
eccentric skating. There was no first night of
note at the theatres, so the first-nighters hied
them to the frozen floor, which proves how very
dull is Sydney. Unfortunately, the clever ingenue
got stage-fright and gave a poor account of herself
on the ice. So such of the onlookers as could
skate stood up on their own account and on their
knife blades, the band blared merrily, and no
harm was done. But she does not mean to be
deterred by this momentary and trifling set-back.
Professor Allander, her instructor, owns that she
is somewhat unique in the matter of skating-
talent, and next year her fond parents are sending
her to Norway, there to get the final polish put on
her art. Norway, as a “finisher” of ice-skaters,
corresponds to Paris in the art-world, Marchesi in
the realm of singing, and Invercargill (M.L.) in
the drink-sphere.
It is expected that over £250 will be realised
from the Brunton memorial benefit which took place
last Thursday. Brunton, by the way, was an ex-
hibitor at the Royal Academy, London.
Mrs. Bland Holt is as loyal to the floral toque
as is Queen Alexandra to her toque and high,
narrow hairdressing. She —Mrs. Holt, not the
King’s consort —raged in the vestibule of the
Royal on Friday afternoon, making money for the
Brunton memorial benefit. Aided by her
floral toque, she sold programmes at 6d. each.
George Rignold gave her £1 for one. The
toque bloomed with several yellow cactus dahlias, a
dozen bunches of mauve acacia, a border of daisies
and a thicket of leaves and buds. It was an
elegant toque, and Mrs. Holt might have juggled
with the change, for no one saw what he was
getting. His eyes were on the section of summer
on the giver’s black hair. “ Look at that glove ”
—she extended a gloved hand that looked as if it
had clasped the paw of a chimney-sweep.
“Doesn’t that look well for the business I’m
doing? Shaking hands, and taking money and
giving change; but, more than all, the printer’s
ink coming off the programmes ! ” In the inter-
vals of sales she told of the musical afternoon
tea at which she and Mrs. Williamson will pre-
side on Monday, the 23rd, when nearly a hundred
of the late artist Brunton’s {pictures will be ex-
hibited for sale.
Miss Lucy Coppin, Mrs. Holt’s inseparable
companion, has gone to Melbourne to the favorite
family surgeon to have her appendix excised.
The operation has been pending for many months,
and it disobligingly refused further postponement.
Mr. C. B. Westmacott circularises to the effect
that the exhibition of the late Mr. John Brunton’s
pictures will be held at the Pianola Parlor, in
George-street, near David Jones’. The manager
of the Pi. Pa. has kindly loaned the apartment to
the committee. Monday (23rd) will see the show
started with music and afternoon tea. On Thurs-
day afternoon the lure of another special entertain-
ment will be offered by Miss Meredith Meredro
and other Meynell and Gunn artistes. Mrs.
Agnes Jensen and Mr. William Asprey have
also promised to make music in the Parlor, and
the entrance fee has been fixed at one shilling.
Melba is sandwiching a little repose between
her recent bush storming and her future Sydney
concerts. She has gone to Mrs. Orr’s, in Macleay-
street —not to the actual boarding section of Orr-
dom, but to the private house of the lady, where
the interviewer, the tuft-hunter, and the im-
mature voice that wishes to be heard cannot
reach her.
Miss Kate Rooney is giving the Backblocks a
treat just now; but before taking her seat in
the Pullman she matineed at the Town Hall in a
gown of white ninon, wearing only her woman’s
glory on her head in place of the conventional
matinee millinery. The supporting artists were
the same as at her previous concert, and again
“ Abide with Me” was on the programme “by
request.” So were a couple of Indian love lyrics
and Goring Thomas’ “Summer Night.” En-
cores were principally Celtic and Gaelic. Zilla’n
Harrison likewise pleased vastly in an aria from
Verdi’s “Ernani,” and another announcing
“Spring is Here,” which we know, for the
calendar says so, and we feel it by the over-
warmth of our winter clothes.
The Chapzanders have left us. They travel
hence to Nippon on a Nipponese liner. Before
they left, Mr. Robert Harkness, who did skilled
labor on the ivories at the revivals, commandeered
the heart of an Adelaide girl with a good voice.
These fishers for souls seem to have great success
at capturing richly-endowed bodies to help carry
on the lucrative work.
Miss Alma Barber, who left for remote regions
last week, was greatly kissed, and will be greatly
missed, by the “Jack and Jill” co. She used to
give merry little tea-parties in her dressing-room
on matinee days. Tea is generally at the root of
the feminine entente cordiale, and it is a mighty
good root, too.
The Titheradges senior (Mr. and Mrs.) have
bought a pretty home out Vaucluse way, next to
Speaker McCourt’s new house. This suggests
that they intend staying in this country for more
than a few moons.
The late Sam Hordern was the living image of
the existent J. C. Williamson. Each was con-
tinually being offered liquid nourishment which
was intended for the other. The ways of ill-
health are passing mysterious. I don’t know
many men—young, middle-aged or old—who
looked so perfectly “ fit ” as always did the dead
money-spinner. He bad, as long as I saw
him about town (which is to say, till the last
month or so), the clear eye and skin, and the spare
figure of a youth of 25 or so. The widow is one of
this State’s handsomest matrons. She, too, has
her prototype—in fact, two of them. For years
folks who might be expected to know better have
been confusing her at theatres, restaurants and
such-like resorts with (1) Mrs. Sydney Burdekin,
(2) Mrs. Prendergast.
Young Steff McDonald, the Sydneysider who
grew his theatrical wings in this city and subse-
quently went to British parts, writes with a pen
dipped in rose-colored ink of his good fortune.
He is to play Captain Laski in “The King of
Cadonia” on tour. Previously the youngster
stayed at the Earl of Yarborough’s castellated
premises, and helped with theatricals, balls and
music. It sounds exhilarating to the stage-
struck.
The local melomaniacs ought to feel warmly
towards Mr. George Stephenson, who has just
grappled to himself the management of Meynell
and Gunn’s panto, co. He spends his leisure in
composing songs.
“ The short-necked woman,” remarked the girl
with the white roly-poly neck, is coming into her
own at last. Hitherto none but the swan-like
ones have been catered for sartorially, but she of
the Rue de la Paix and Bond-street has decreed
that soft turn-down collars, already christened
“ Peter Pans,” and no collars at all are lo be It
this coming summer, and the barbed wire-looking
4in. neck corsets are to be discarded.” Sara
Bernhardt brought in the high lace neck-fence,
and she and her contemporaries are not likely to
adopt the Peter Pan cult. After 30 your neck
proves you to be a bit of a bird. Not one woman
in a million, out of the twenties, may publish her
neck as Nellie Stewart does. Miss Stewart has
the neck of a girl born in 1890, and all feminine
Sydney is wondering “how she does it.” Most
probably she doesn’t “do it.” It just happens.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

Homeseekers from all over Australia are turning
towards Greenacre Park, Bankstown—it has so many
advantages to offer them.
GREENACRE PARK has the pure air, the
clear sunshine, the delightful surroundings of the
country, yet is close to the heart of the city. . It

terminus of the Belmore railway extension, just
11 miles from Sydney. The journey takes 30 minutes,
and the weekly fare is only 2s. 7d. The lots are
large and roomy—or you may have an acre block if
you wish.
Just think of the possibilities of an acre of good
land served with city water, and you will have some
idea of what your home may be like at Greenacre Park.
As an investment we can strongly recommend
building lots, business sites, or acre blocks there.
Dozens of homes will go up this Spring—values must
increase. Why not share in this profit ?
Building - lots, J 616 10s.; acre blocks, JE32 10s.;
business sites, 355. foot. Terms from £1 down, 10s. monthly.

If your neighbor were to spend a million pounds im-
proving his land, would it affect your property ?
Would increase its value greatly, wouldn’t it ?
Well, that is what is happening to RIVERSIDE
HEIGHTS ESTATE, at Newington, Auburn. The
estate adjoins the site of the new abattoirs, on which the
Government are about to spend a million pounds. The
site is prepared—tenders are to be called shortly for the
buildings.
When the abattoirs are running, over 1000 men will
be employed there—looo families will need homes close
by. The most suitable place for these homes is on
RIVERSIDE HEIGHTS ESTATE.
Lots are selling now as low as J 613 10s. A year
hence they will command at least double that. Better
investigate. Terms from 10s. deposit, ss. monthly.

The MOST DESIRABLE TYRE
Reliability, durability and efficiency may be considered
as going' hand in hand as the first considerations in the
manufacture cf the most desirable Motor Tyres and
in no tyres will this trinity of features be found more
pronounced than in the ever-popular Continental variety.

“reliability” is “ability to get there,” and not only
to get there, but to get there well; to be certain at the
commencement of a journey that the end is in sight.
CONTINENTAL TYRES
MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 16, 1909.
Mt Dear Yarrik,—
The most dimpled damsel of an ex-viceregal
set of daughters has long caused remark among
anxious mammas. The lady has turned down
ardent and eligible adorers in at least two
States, and refused to have any truck with
the marriage mart. She has acted as a
blockade in the disposal of the younger spinsters
—the Biancas of the family—who, apparently,
have to wait for the marriage of Katharine.
Much talk centred, years ago, around the dimpled
one and a British warrior. The warrior is still
a bachelor, and is how bent on visiting the native
country of the maid. Gossips are awaiting develop-
ments with bated breath.
A brand new infant of vast importance in Mel-
bourne is the first born of the Gerald Black-
bournes. It paid its entry fee in the yelling
competition only a few days ago, but has every
symptom of winning the race. Gerald has another
beautiful name correctly hyphenated, but it is so
intricate that I cannot get my pen round it unless
I have been braced up by a long holiday.
Babies have become quite a known quantity
lately in Melbourne, and several new yells are
piercing the atmosphere, The Charlie Beau-
champs have a junior partner in training for the
job of chief auctioneer to the firm. Also Manager
Goldie, of the Hugh Ward co., rushes about like a
delighted lunatic, waving news of the arriyal of a
son in his camp. Mrs. Dulcie Deamer Goldie
and the son and heir are in Maoriland with
mother. • ; ~ .
Mrs. Gunn, whose daughter Ethel married the
sawbones of a visiting warship, has tripped
to Europe to . see her offspring. Accord-
ing to latest reports she has reached
London, and is sitting entranced in the
Kensington flat, gazing at that infuriated
potentate Baby. Her daughter, Mrs. Dr. Laver-
tine, has had a gorgeous time “abrawd.” Her
husband’s people own bogs and castles and a
whole terrace of banshees in Ireland, and a
brother doctor is in the medical swim in London.
lam tired of saying things about balls. Never-
theless, there are still folk ready to dance, and
much that is pompous in the way of whirl arrives
as the winter thaws out. One of these events is
the C. L. C. Ball, which, being interpreted,
means Catholic Ladies’ College. The affair is to
be on Monday, August 23, with Mrs. Cussen,
Mrs. Meagher and Mrs. Maurice Macgillicuddy
as goddesses in the machine. The name of Maurice
Macgillicuddy strikes me as something of an
effort in alliteration.
Mrs. Senator Best is throwing herself with fer-
vor into politics, and has a two-months-old salon
for the propagation of the voting spirit among her
kind. The salon is successful so far—in numbers
at any rate. And it has an excellent catchment
of silver-tongued politicians to condescend affably
and daintily to the feminine intelligences that are
fashionably arrayed before them. Nevertheless
the enthusiastic young lady has had troubles of
her own in the organising of the affair. Her
seniors, in the line of politicians’ wives, feel injured
that the initiative should have been taken by a
“ mere girl,” or one not much beyond girlhood.
The need and the opportunity have been discussed
languidly and boredly for months and years.
“We must do something —those Labor women
take things so seriously, don’t-you-know,” is a
remark that has been made over and over again.
But until Mrs. Best snatched at the opportunity
no one took it up and brandished it as a gleaming
sword or a drawing-room brass poker. And
because the pretty young Best dame took up the
Fused torch, the ancients are growling. They
prod her viciously and heap up small an-
noyances. “I don’t want to lead,” murmurs
the lady on the verge of tears. “I only want
them to come and talk and boost things along.”
One of the reasons why the Fusion is going to be
a deadly failure is that the wives of the Fusionists
won’t Fuse.
Tea-rooms and the chorus make excellent
diving-boards for the sea of matrimony. Another
little Chicago girl leaves the place where they cry
“One Irish stew, one soup, hash one v for the
gentle art of warming a husband’s slippers and
smoothing his hair when it begins to grow thin.
Miss Cummings is to marry Eisher, of the Bank
of Australasia. He was wont to handle the gold
of Melbourne, but now manages the institution at
Goulburn.
The local Newlyweds are in terror of their lives
and their spoons. Burglars have been reading
the society rags and tracking down the lists of
presents. Hansiker, who came unscathed through
the ordeal of “witnessing” in the great divorce
case, has just married a tender young bride of 18
springs, and he has had everything looted to the
last fish-slicer. A well-known solicitor is curbing
with one arm and consoling his young wife with
the other. Not only has the silver fled off the
premises ; but every frill is gone, and the wretches
even took the family jewels, packed in a silk
stocking in the far corner of the left-hand drawer.
Artist Will Longstaff shared the fate of the other
newly-weds; but he bagged his burglar and
dragged the ruffian by the ear to the seat of
justice.
Rose Musgrove and her new husband are doing
a furious trial by motor. They want to own just
the cutest thing that goes on wheels. The Gar-
rick money seems to grow in heaps. Rose was at
one time reputedly engaged to the Garrick brother
—who is a social item of some poundage in
Sydney. Planter Garrick, who has married the
lady, met her in Colombo.
Rose Musgrove’s small sister May is a nurse in
the Children’s Hospital of this city. She has
some smattering of mummer’s talent, and sister
Rose advises her to throw up nursing for the
stage. But small sister argues that there may not
be enough stage luck in the family to go round.
Mrs. Williamson dropped on to this rainy city
last week for a quiet spell in Melbourne. As she
is domiciled at the Grand, she will be as quiet as
fireworks or a Wagner overture. Along with her
is the American cousin of the great, J.C. —also
Williamson by name, with the prefix Cassius,
dubbed “Cass” for short. J.C. himself is leaving
London just at this period for Noo York. He
will sprint through Hamerrika, and return on
the Makura. That cuts out Mrs. Williamson’s
Colombo trip. Like a docile, affectionate wife, she
intended going that far to meet hubby. The
strain of a voyage to Auckland at this time of the
year is another thing. Colombo is all red earth
and blue sky and blue sea and wildly-green
foliage—a restful shriek of color, so to speak.
Auckland consists mostly of a worried blast blow-
ing up the Hauraki Gulf.
One never knows what these classic musicians
are capable of. In this case it seems as if good
old Mendelssohn had made the date of his birth a
movable feast, and had been born all over the
calendar in the same way as Homer was buried
over a great area of country. Johanna has a dis-
tinct impression of being enveloped in the har-
monies of a philharmonic festival, commemorative
of Mendelssohn’s centenary, and that was six
months ago in Sydney. Now Mr. Frederick
Mewton, batoning a full (yet emptv-of-alcohol)
orchestra and a choir 200 strong, did the centenary
business over the same musical gentleman last
Monday (August 16) at the Masonic Hall. A
cheap brown dictionary of biography in my
possession says that Mendelssohn arrived on
February 3, 1809. The statement is corroborated
by a large, dusty volume with moths in it. A
reddish authority with a broken back just says he
Was born, and shirks the date. Anyhow, Mr.
Fred Mewton’s proceedings were worth listening
to. Various Tooraketty angels put their warble
into “Elijah ” and “The Hymn of Praise,” and
various Governor folk patroned the event, backed
Up by a society following. The leading warblers
were Mrs. Downes, Miss Conly, Mr. Banfield and
Mr. “Jimmie” Wade.
The Medico Macgillicuddya got the first look-in
with a party to Amy Castles. They gave a
notable little lunch in the private dining-room of
the Grand. The wise management supplied a
King Arthurian round table, whereby jealousy of
place was obliterated. There is no top to around
table, nor is there any bottom. There is neither
a below nor an above the salt. Mrs. Macgillicuddy
got herself into glad rags of Parma violet, and her
husband wore the most fetching of his thousand
ties. Guest-in-Chief Amy Castles looked snugly
plump in a blue confection, cut with a fascinating
wriggle or waggle to its narrow skirt train. Mrs.
Gavari Duffy topped her fur-swamped self
with a gay spring bonnet; and Parson Sug-
den brought a daughter as chaperone. Mrs.
Arthur Ryan, a charming, fair lady who
was Miss Aggie McMahon, has been abroad
with Miss Castles. Brother George Castles was
at the lunch also, with shamrocks in his green
tie. The Celtic crowd gasped when it was found
that there were thirteen at table. Miss Castles
settled the matter by commanding that everyone
should rise up at the one moment. “Then we’ll
all die together,” she laughed. Someone solemnly
performed the rite of throwing salt over his left
shoulder, and it was felt that the gods were
appeased. Yet Alphonso of Spain imparted a
royal purple tint to the old superstition by being
the first to die after he had been the first to rise
from a thirteen dinner. But, then, kings can’t
afford to take risks. Even if they took their
meals under the table, like a dog, they’d be all
the safer for not going out of doors at all, for
there might be thirteen anarchists waiting for
them outside. And there is nothing more un-
lucky than to have thirteen bombs thrown at you
on a Friday.
The Hugh Ward show gave a night to the
glory of Amy Castles. Her box was framed in
wattle, and the warbler filled the frame with a
rose colored dream of adressand a wrap of million-
aire ermine that had hundreds of tails to vouch
for its pedigree. The house said it was pleased,
to see her in a thunderous sort of way, and the
gallery waved its banana and whistled. The
gallery would have got even more excited had it
seen the entire sartorial glory of the lady. The
rose-colored gown was directoire to the last gasp,
and cut to the knee at that. An amber silk stock-
ing and amber satin shoe stood forth as evidence
of the no-petticoat craze. Mrs. Ward, in black
and diamonds, brought Amy into the box, and
Brother George and Mr. Stetson helped in the black
backgrounding. Mrs. Brennan and the Softgoods
Felsteads were opposite with Mrs. Commissioner
Fitzpatrick.
Miss Castles went behind at the end of the
show (“The Fencing Master”) to yarn to the
stars, but even then, after the theatre was seat-
flapped and swathed in darkness, the crowd
waited outside and elbowed and hustled her into
the motor-ear. If the lady’s houses are as en-
thusiastic as the audiences of these outside views,
she’ll be doubly glad that she came back to Aus-
tralia.
The Shakspearian Society gave a party to the
Asehes. President Stephens got gloriously drunk
on a “treatise” about the bard (the real Shak-
spearian can get wildly intoxicated upon a new
reading of a comma at the back of “Hamlet”).
Murray, harried between politics and Shakspeare,
rushed at a gallop through a three-mile speech.
The Asche-Braytons stood it very well. Then
Miss May Stamp sang “Mariana”—a Shak-
spearian song composed by Mrs, Alsop. It may
have been the reaction after the treatises or the
wild excitement of the tea interval, but the Salon-
ites mobbed Marion Alsop, the song-maker. Miss
Bray ton paid her a practical compliment by com-
missioning her to write a tune for “Tell Me
Where is Fancy Bred.” Miss Brayton means to
have it sung in the present Shakspearian season,
and also in London.
It looks “ of a Saturday ” as if Melbourne were
mummer mad and sassiety lived on First Nights.
Just as the burning of Rome amused a gentleman
with an emerald eyeglass, so the burning of Her
Sydney Majesty’s gave an unexpected sop to the
gourmand stage-eaters by supplying them with
“ The Flag Lieutenant.” There was no ballet for
the men, but plenty of frock for the women.
Ethel Warwick filled the bill for them. She
frocks her languid length gladly. One evening
undress is apparently built of purple pansies, with
gold on her hair and gold on her shoes. Dorothy
Grimston backs up the glad purple with dull
blue toggery. Titheradge got his Melbourne
welcome back to health, and it thundered
over all the “knocks” the newcomers got.
Since the show was military, Commandant
Stanley came along to criticise, and a
smattering of other warriors followed suit.
Amy Castles, in a box and a soft blue suit, got
her how-do from the house. Mrs. Tallis har-
monised with the blue in the same box by wearing
a dress of melted amethysts. Amy Castles’
very young aunt (Mrs. Arther Ryan) wore big
‘ bows of pink in her flaxen thatch. Mrs. J. C.
Williamson, wearing the last cry in Frenchified
black, had Mrs. Brennan and Miss Ballet-Jennie
in her box. Among the Everybodies and Some-
ones and Hope-to-Bes who helped pack the house,
there were two conspicuous strangers in the circle
—a most adorable fair girl (“gel” I should say)
materialised out of soft lavender wrappings, and
a striking brunette, who glowed among the erow-
like black and white men like a hibiscus flower.
Nearly everyone had been out to Caulfield in the
afternoon for the small winter meeting. “ The
girls all turn up,” remarked a man, cynically,
“because it’s the only meeting where the tickets
carry a railway-passage free —they save their two
bob.”
Mr. Tralford Foster, whom local girls knew
affectionately as “Trally,” has returned from
London town. He is a beauteous youth with a
beauteous voice. Both were shown to perfection
in the Masonic Hall last week. Other Australians
backed up the musical cast. Alberto Zelman
made magic with his fiddle. Alberto only lacks
the necessary glamor of being imported from a far
country at fabulous expense to be a boom in Aus-
tralia. His music-making is a beautiful thing—an
atmosphere of dreams and restfulness. Miss
Beatrice Higginson warbled shrilly, and Weston-
Pett followed melodiously with his flute.
Tosti has had Foster in training for years of
steady study. Thereby Foster has made his voice
a thing of beauty, and is eager to pass on his tech-
nical knowledge to aspiring warblers in this city.
Soubrette Lottie Sargeant has a swag of devoted
admirers, who generally overlooked Mr. Lottie
until they bumped against him. Mr. Lottie’s
name is Green, and he is a most personable
substance to crash against. Girls take him to be
a beauty actor, till they find he's no mummer—
only the husband of one.
A Melbourne charmer writes from London :
Mrs. George Chirnside has taken a new lease of life by
some mysterious means—Christian Science or something.
She transpired at the Thompson-McEacharn wedding in a
inaroon creation, fitting in postage-stamp fashion to her
gver-youthful form. A sample of the latest millinery
topped her eighteen-car t head. George' was in attend-
ance, and a few stray cavaliers dangled in the blonde’s
neighborhood.
Miss Madaleine McEacharn made a real perky bride,
ind startled the guests by enfolding all her chums with
a Teddy bear hug. Scores of them received an embrace
from the new Mrs. Husband Thompson is the son of* a
wealthy Scotch baronet, so the couple will share a big
fortune. They had a right to look happy, which was
more than could be said for the bride’s mother. The
Gaud-Mayor McEacharn of yore is in bad health these
times. He was missing at the nuptials of his daughter,
and immediately after the knot-tying his wife went back
to the country to nurse him some more.
Warbler Kirby has returned from the land of macaroni
considerably fat, but with the voice polished and im-
proved out of all recognition. He complains mournfully
that Italy’s wine gave him rheumatism, while the oiled
Victuals gave him extra avoirdupois. All the same, a
certain duchess gives him lier blessing and helps his con-
certs along.
The season for the Fisken Sisters has not been all Fizz
find Skittles. The maternal progenitor has been struggling
with bronchitis —that bugbear of the English climate.
Their tinie has, consequently, been halved between
nursing and parties.
From “ Rosna,” of Adelaide :
The Bosanquets asked Parliament and its wife to' a
party on Wednesday night. There was a string band in
the hall, and in the ballroom easy chairs, where Mrs. Parlia-
ment sat and considered her husband’s bitterest foe and
his wife and his wife’s frock. Her Ex. and the twins dis-
tributed their smiles as equally as possible over the three
parties, who were just in the midst of a no-confidence
debate ; and they were undisturbed when certain, ardent
politicians turned up in brown suits and green ties. There
was a supper to which the Ministry and its wife went in
first; also there was a smattering of op'her guests, includ-
ing, the Chief Justice Ways, the Major Pattersons, the
American Consul Prossers, the Colonel Rowells, and some
more.
Jup. Pluvius went to bed with influenza, and we had
two whole fine days. Excellency Bosanquet and the
girls celebrated by strolling down to Seaton to view the
golf practice. It fs’ only a trifle of seven miles across
country—pretty boggy country too —but the twins don’t
know what the tired feeling means, so they arrived in
excellent repair and temper. If the average local girl
had set out to walk that distance, she would probably be
still reclining in the middle of Woodville, or thereabouts,
waiting for her remains to be collected. We don’t walk
much in Adelaide.
Mr. Bevan, of the University’s Musical School, produced
his champion voices for public inspection on Monday eve.
The result was a “ Stabat Mater” and slices of Mendel-
ssohn’s “ Athalie.” This “Stabat” had never been per-
formed in Australia before. Still, that is like us in Ade-
laide. We are pioneers in lots of things, including suf-
frage, and simple land titles, and being a province, and
Songs of Australia, and marrying our deceased wife’s
Sister. But we never mention any of these things. Mr.
Bevan’s vocal exhibits included several damsels and a
tenor whose voice we all said was “ divine.” His name is
Walter Wood, and his solo, with its artistic accompani-
ment of choir, gave the ordinary cherubim no hope. The
whole Gov’ment House family were there, with two aides,
and some Ways and Barlows (representing the ’Varsity) ;
likewise the Bishop and Bishopess came, accompanied by
a large score of the “Mater,” to prove it was a good
religious party to which even a bishop might go in safety.
The Victoria Park races were not overpowering in the
matter of excitement. The Exes, were punctually on the
spot, the lady coat-and-skirted in blue, the twins in leaf
green and flowery millinery. Fanny Dango, garbed, in
Saxe-blue empire, wandered over the lawns, and there
were batches of visitors from the mail boat. The
Attorney-General Mitchells w'ent down to meet the
Westralian Premier and befriended him, as well as Amy
Castles. They motored the party out to Victoria Park,
and it had afternoon tea with the Exes.—except Miss
Castles, who only had time to get out of the motor, turn
round three times, and then rush back.
i Otto Heggie, once of Adelaide, and then,of the “Mes-
sage from Mars,” was lately acting in Galsworthy’s
“Strife,” and did so well that Frohman immediately
snapped him up for his Repertoire Company. Gals-
worthy, Barrie, Bernard Shaw and Granville Barker are
t'o write occult plays for the co., and the accumulated
brilliance will begin to scintillate in London during
February next.
There are plans on foot to kidnap singer Peter Dawson
when he arrives at Adelaide, and sing at him. But as
the event will be in the past tense when this reaches its
print frock, and is only future tense at the moment of
writing, I shall keep the affair to myself and not'tell you
anything about it.
Old Mrs. Angas, widow of the sheep-and-cattle million-
aire, has been ill. She dwelt at Henley Beach for
some months, but the other day took a special train,
and, with a daughter and a nurse, went by smooth
stages to the old home at Collingrove.
Adelaide has (or had) three or four well-known people
on the Waratah ; and when, the other day, the un-
fortunately premature news was spread that the ship had
been found, the city rang its joy-bells and went out to
celebrate. And they say we in Adelaide are slow,
deliberate folk, and not prone to excitement.
This week, if the state of polities will allow, the
Governor-Admiral and his wife and their daughters, and
some aide-de-camps and other baggage-carriers will visit
the Murray cod in his lair. Renmark, where the river
oranges come from, is having a Show, and his Ex. has
kindly consented to get the thing open. The jaunt will
occupy some days, and all the villages en route have been
polishing up their elocution.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
“ J.E.M.” writes :
Judge Rogers’ who made the absurd attack on the
Commonwealth’s Post-Office administration the other
day, evidently doesn’t know that, prior to Federation,
there was no minimum salary provision in the N.S.W.
Public Service Acts. The Federal Parliament, however,
provided that, after attaining 21 years of age and com-
pleting three years’ service, a public servant, male or
female, should be paid not less than £lOO per annum. In
the good old days, when Joe Cook was P.M.G. of N. S.
Wales, full-blown postmasters were convicted of stealing
money though they didn’t get more than £9O a year;
and cases were discovered of adult telegraph officials
marrying on 255. a week. Things are not worse but a
heap better under Federation ; and when the Common-
wealth gets possession of its own revenues, they will be a
lot better still.
WHITE HERE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Archdeacon Crossley said it was regrettable that the
magnificent prayer, that we might all be one, had been
modernised to ask that we might all be white, or Britons,
or Australians.—Melbourne Argus.
Why must I ever struggle with a too particular soul
Which cannot bear this deacon’s prayer for niggers, half
or whole ?
What dreadful flame of bitter pride burns fiercely in my
breast
That I abhor proposals for race-union, parson-blest?
Why do I see,
Invariably,
In him who preaches piebaldry, the traitor self-con-
fessed ?
I pity those who cherish my discolored fellow-man ;
I cannot seat myself at meat with aliens, black or tan,
Nor can I drink in places where pigmented persons
browse ;
I do not care to breathe the air in cars containing Chows —
No, I do not,
No matter what
The pale, protesting deacon or the holy law allows.
All white, whatever happens, let our fair Australia be,
Enlighten e’en the deacon that his blinded eyes may see
The piebald evil as it is, and preach the Chow no more,
But see our nation’s cause as he has seen it ne’er before—
To understand
And lend a hand
And freshen up the sign “ White Here ! ” upon Aus-
tralia’s door!
VICTORIA.

SCIENCE SPEAKS.
In the treatment of any wound or sore, you
must not disregard the facts revealed ’by
scientific investigation. To heal speedily and
permanently it is essential to cleanse the affected
tissues and remove any poisonous element that
may be present. The part must then be so
soothed and vitalised that Nature can restore it
at once.
To accomplish this result, an ointment must be
used which, in its action while allaying- all
irritation, penetrates to the underlying tissues
and purifies thoroughly.
Chase’s Universal Ointment is recognised as
the most unfailing preparation for the treatment
of cuts, wounds, bruises, etc., and skin
diseases in cases of long standing.
This famous Ointment is now manufactured in
Australia, and will sent post paid to any
address upon receipt of price— 3/6.
Please note — Chase’s Universal Ointment is
always supplied in glass jars to avoid contact
with metal.

JUST ONE THING
TO CURE AN/EMIA.
>
Increased Blood Supply the
Only Treatment.
$
A Weak, Run Down Australian
Woman Relates how She Built
up her Blood and Became Well.
The only thing that people suffering with
anaemia can do to he cured is to increase their
blood supply. That’s all they need to do. They
will be cured just as soon as they have enough
blood, because anaemia is a bloodless, run down
state. When the body becomes weak and run
down, either from overwork, worry or severe
illness, an examination of the blood would show
it to be weak and watery. The common symptoms
are paleness of the lips, gums and cheeks, short-
ness of breath and palpitation of the heart after
the slightest exertion, dull eyes and loss of
appetite. Anaemia itself is a dangerous disease
and may gradually pass into consumption. It
can only be cured by making the blood rich and
red, thereby enabling it to carry the necessary
nourishment to every part of the body.
The next question is what to take to increase
the blood supply. It is a fact that Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills have cured hundreds of cases of anaemia.
They are really intended to make blood. They
are carefully compounded in the most scientific
manner with the tinest ingredients for the blood
known to medical science. Twelve years’ record
in Australia shows how good they are. The
following case is an excellent instance of how
they cure.
‘•Three or four years ago I noticed myself
getting run down,” said Miss Sophie Sarow, 78
Caxton Street, Petrie Terrace, Brisbane. “I lost
all taste for my meals. I bad to force myself to
eat. After eating I’d be weighed down with a
load on my chest, and a dull pain right through
to my back. I was very nervous and despondent.
I used to think some disaster was hanging over
me, I got headaches in my temples and on the
top of my head, and they’d perhaps last all day.
I’d be quite done up if I walked quickly, and I’d
have to stop and rest for the way my heart would
beat. If I stood for long my ankles would swell
up. I lost all my color and fell off in weight. My
ears always had a buzzing sound in them. I had
verv little strength or energy, everything was
wearisome. The doctor told me I was badly run
down, and gave me tonics which did me good only
for a time. Then, about six months ago, I read
newspaper reports of cures by Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, and decided to try them. As I took them
my health began to return in the most surprising
way. I lost my sallow look, and soon began to
relish my food, and the pains of indigestion got
less every day. My head ached less with every
box I took. Before I’d finished the third box I
was vastly better than I had been for months. I
felt stronger and brighter in my spirits. The swell-
ing in my ankles went down and I put on flesh. I’ve
kept splendid since I finished the last box. I can
get through a long and heavy day now without
any trouble.”
While so promptly effective, these pills contain
no harmful stimulants or opiates. They are
perfectlv safe and create no drug habit. Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills are sold by chemists and
storekeepers, or sent by mail, post paid on receipt
of price, 2s. 9d. per box, six boxes 15s. 3d., by The

POLITICAL
POINTS
“Alexem ” : Easy enough to understand
the violent unpopularity with the Spaniards of
the war in Morocco. Spain has never got any-
thing but hard fighting out of its African
possessions—if the term isn’t too pre-
tentious when applied to a few small
fortified posts. Ceuta, perhaps, might
fairly he called a miniature colony,
since it occupies a peninsula five
or six miles long; but the other
holdings are mere presidios , ex-
cept, perhaps, Melilla, which I
visited in the ’7o’s. Melilla, near
which most of the recent fight-
ing has taken place, may take
rank as a town, perched on
a promontory and strongly
fortified, though what the
value of it is to Spain is hard
to imagine. It dates from
about the middle of the 17th
century, and may perhaps have
been intended as a check upon
the Riff pirates, a much more
barbarous set of marauders than
t le Algerines, though not so well-
equipped. These Riff miscreants were,
even when I was in the locality nearly 40 years
ago, a serious menace to sea-borne life' and' pro-
perty! and it used to make shipmasters not a little
nervous to be becalmed in the neighborhood.
The High Court in Sydney the other day
dismissed the appeal of the Mutual Loan Agency,
which had been fined for running a lottery. This
was the concern which advertised that for a sub-
scription of ss. a month the share or warrant
holders participated in a ballot on the Starr-
Bowkett principle, the winners receiving a
“loan ” repayable (without interest) in 50 years ;
or if they didn't agree to refund in 50 years, they
were allowed 70 per cent, of the loan uncondition-
ally* This was such a thinly-disguised sweep that
the eo. apparently decided not to contest that
aspect of the case. It preferred to rely on the
point that a corporation can’t be punished as a
rqgUe and a vagabond. The appeal, therefore,
raged round Act No. 10 of William HI., and other
anbient statutes. Fortunately, Bill 111., being in
a hurry to get away to the Battle of the Boyne,
jHadn’t fixed his Act the way the Mutual Loan
Agency thought he had, and the Agency got no
belief—only contumely and Costs.
In Maoriland last year, as the result of
the tariff biffing out the Yankee article, the home
consumption of locally grown and tinned fruit
jumped up by over £40,000. Orchards and can-
ning plants are being extended in every direction,
and naturally the cost of production is becoming
so much cheaper that Maoriland now has visions
of soon being able to talk to the Yankee peach
and pear in the London market.
For want of something better to do,
various alleged irrigationists, contractors and
others in northern Victoria have been
railing at the Water Commissioners
for getting their outlet-boxes and
other items made by day labor.
Rodney and Swan Hill and other
districts were quite sure the £6 each,
which the boxes cost, was far too
much—any contractor or carpenter
would supply them at far less. To
settle the argument, the Commission-
ers called for tenders for 100.
Rodney’s lowest tender was £B, and
Swan Hill’s £l3 2s. Also, the same
Commissioners have wearied of
Kerang’s habit of charging 4s. per
foot for building timber bridges,
having found they could do the work
themselves for 2s. 9d. per foot. No
wonder certain landowners in the irri-
gation districts want a return to the
days of the local Trusts. Under that
regime they could get quite enough
pickings without making any pre-
tence at irrigation.
The agriculturist is even liable to demand
that the State shall wash his sack for him. It
seems that Private Enterprise imports super-
phosphates and other smellful merchandise in
bags, and when the receptacle is empty it is sold
for the conveyance of fruit and other tasty edibles.
Having in vain implored Private Enterprise to be
cleaner and less horrible with its bag, the N.S.W.
farmer is now applying to the State (1) to prohibit
dealings in second-hand bags, or (2) to establish a
Government steaming house in which the dirty
bag of Private Enterprise will be cleaned on
purely Socialistic principles.
“ Give Ifc Up ” writes :
Possibly no limit will ever be reached in the Willis
improvement lease business, but the N.S.W. law last
week made some approach thereto. In the shindy about
the Is. an acre industry, the leases which made most
noise were those granted to Patrick Rea, said to be a
stableman, and Michael Hayes, a postman. Hayes van-
ished just when he was most wanted. He was granted
13,745 acres and Rea 10,795 acres of land. Neither of the
lessees could spare time from his arduous duties to
become a squatter, so each transferred his land to
Mrs. Mary Willis, with the approval of the Lands
Department. She accordingly found herself in pos-
session of a sheep station called Wingadee. The shire
council rated this property, and claimed £7l per
annum. Mrs. Willis refused to pay, and the council sued.
The case wandered through several Courts, and at last
the Pull one hurled the claim into the abyss of Costs. It
said that the N.S.W. land laws were vague on many
points, but one principle was clear. It had been proved,
to the ruin of a hatful of litigants, that under no circum-
stances could Crown lands be leased to a married woman
who was not living apart from her husband. So Mrs.
Willis was not, and never had been, lessee of Wingadee.
The Court brushed aside with the tail of its wig the small
fact that the Department had done what it hadn’t the
power to do. So it is up to the Department to explain
how it came to allow the transfer to Mrs. Willis. As
things stand now the council can only recover rates from
Rea and Hayes. This is a small detail, for the shire has
probably given up the rates as a bad job by this time. A
more important matter is that while the leases belong to
a stableman who is making no use of the land, and a
postman who has gone away, the progress of closer set-
tlement at Wingadee is liktiy to be slow.
THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL RAILWAY.
Certain pirish pump politicians with axes to prind,
are suggesting that the N. and S. Transcontinental rail-
way be taken round by Queensland and N.S. Wales and
elsewhere.
"S'pose we hare it going ‘ roun’ an’ roun’ an
roun’ !”
The Fused Government talks of a defici
of £1,200,000 for the year. It might, anyhow, he
honest about the matter and say that the esti-
mated deficit is really £1,850,000, but that W.
Lyne and the Labor Government between them
saved up £050,000 during the past year and the
last month of the preceding year. Several mem-
bers of the Fusion party said it was a shameful
thing for Lyne to do when he started it; never-
theless, the Fusion Government collars the Lyne
and Labor party’s savings and uses them to hide
part of its own shocking incapacity.
Ex-N.S.W. Premier Carruthers has been
telling Sydney Agbicdltukal Gazette that the
Monaro farmer is the livest person around when
it comes to dealing with the rabbit. The Snowy
River hayseed doesn’t worry much about bunny—
he just sows a strip of rye around his wheat, and
goes on with his other business. It seems bunny
won’t eat or pass through growing rye. This
makes the 79th (or thereabouts) subject for ad-
miration discovered on Monaro since that locality
was reckoned too horrible to contain the Austra-
lian capital.
WHEN I WAS A BOY.
Bringing on the Umpire. Date 1909 or thereabouts.
For one poor little block of third-class
land made available at Tar win South (Vic.) the
other day there were 78 frantic applicants. And
the Abgus is still quite sure that the big Western
landlords are voluntarily cutting up their estates
so fast that there is no need at all for a graduated
tax to prod them into greater activity.
The N.S.W. Public Works Committee
nearly swooned with horror the other day, when
Dr. Creed, M.L. C., gave evidence before it that it
would be ridiculous for the State to splash up good
coin on new Parliamentary buildings, because
Unification and a new subdivision of the country
will arrive soon. Committeeman Hurley got his
breath first, and sadly asked Chairman Flowers if
it was any use examining this witness further.
Flowers thought they might as well proceed, and
thereupon the doctor cheerfully remarked that the
old buildings would last long enough with a little
patching—they wouldn’t have to last very long,
anyhow. Then the Committee fell down dead
three times simultaneously.
The Premiers’ Conference was a curious
affair. It included two Premiers (Peake and
Kidston) who are holding office by a majority of
one vote each ; a Premier (Newton Moore) who
has just had a deficit of over £lOO,OO0 —the sixth
his State has shown in six years ; a legal Premier
(Wade) who recently lost three costly actions in one
day ; a Prime Minister with £1,200,000 shortage
in his cash ; the boss tired man of Australia
(Murray); and Neil Lewis, about whom it is im-
possible to remember anything remarkable at the
moment. Out of the seven, Kidston fused with
Philp, Wade fused with Waddell, Murray fused
with Peacock, Peake fused with Butler, Neil
Lewis fused with Propsting, Deakin fused with.
Cook, and the only man of the lot who wasn’t
more or less fused was Newton Moore.
Among the points advanced in favor of the
Deakin-Cook Fusion by its supporters have been :
(1) that “it had put affairs on a sound basis”;
(2) that “it had re-established the efficiency of
Parliament” ; (3) that “it had restored Respon-
sible Government ” ; (4) that “it had put public
affairs on a broad national basis”; (5) that “it
had brought back majority rule”; (6) that “it
had restored to the people the proper control of
affairs.” All these things are doubtless very
beautiful, but they look shockingly intangible
compared with the fact that the Deakin-Cookists
propose to borrow £1,200,000 to fill the gap in one
year’s revenue. A “broad national basis” may
be all right, but this broad national lOU is
horrible.
“Nomadic” writes from Alice Springs
(Central Australia) :
I was inspecting some picture postcards recently, and
came across an entrancing scene of still back-waters,
ducks, and wildfowl, with shady trees fringing the
water, and in the foreground I noticed a sportsman
lying in wait with rod and gun. This card was labelled
“ Scene on the River Murray.” I was wondering to myself
if this was some of the water that Wade and Murray
want to steal from us, when on closer inspection I recog-
nised in the sportsman a friend of mine. Knowing that
he had never been on the Murray, I wrote asking for an
explanation. He replied thusly : “ Scene mentioned by
you was taken on The Neales, at Oodnadatta.” lam
still in a quandary as to the photographer’s object in
labelling the card as be did. Probably he thought people
would call him a liar if he mentioned water as being
indigenous to Oodnadatta at the northern end of S.A.’s
“ d.sert railway.”
The Tweed River (N.S.W.) is getting
quite excited. For years past our British fellow-
subject, Ram Bux, from India, has pervaded the
district in large numbers. When he collared the
white laborer’s job, because he offered to work for
a little—which he was able to do because he lived
on almost nothing—the Tweed River was as placid
as its own cow. When he courted and married
the white girl, and a piebald family grew up
around his hut, the district went on chewing the
cud. But when lately Ram Bux started to
apply for land, then the Tweed River woke up ;
and Murwillumbah held a big public meet-
ing on the subject, and passed emphatic
resolutions of protest. For years Thk Bulletin
has been waiting for the North Coast to protest
against Ram Bux and Tommy Tanna living with
the white man’s daughter and degrading the
white man’s race ; yet never a public meeting has
it beard of. But when the discolored gentlemen
compete for a cow-run, it is too horrible an in-
famy forthe district to sit quiet under. Honestly,
doesn’t the N.S.W. North Coast reckon it ought
to be a bit ashamed of itself?
“Battler”: Melbourne Tramway Co.
employees are secretly cursing the busybodies like
Premier Murray, who tore round uni talked the
co. into reinstating the three men v h > were sum-
marily spilt off the cars for daring to assume, in
an unguarded moment, that possibly their souls
were their own. Their reinstatement squelched a
lively Parliamentary rising, wiped out a promis-
ing agitation, and abolished all chance of a public
investigation of the co.’s conduct for years to
come. On returning, the men had to give a
specific promise that they would hate and abjure
all ideas of a union of tram employees ; and now
conditions in the service are more infamous than
before, and no employee trusts his fellow, or
dares breathe a word derogatory to the bosses, the
system, or anything connected with the all-hog
monopoly. As a sufferer my fervent wish was for
a fight. Cursed are the peacemakers.
The Fused Government’s latest foolish
interference with the liberty of the subject is
Postmaster-General Quick’s ukase that alcohol
must not be sent through the post. Quack medi-
cines can go through the post even though they
are loaded with alcohol. So can bogus hair-
restorers. If a big brewery sends out a host
of circulars urging people to drink beer,
Quick’s department actually allows a dis-
count on the transaction. Orders for liquor
are carried at the usual rates. Quick’s depart-
ment subsidises mail steamers that provide for
th.e swift conveyance of drink, also mail coaches
which dispense it in the Backblocks. If you want
to telegraph the order “Send two bottles of
whisky at once,” Quick will send the message.
When the Federal transcontinental railways are
built they will certainly carry liquor as well as
other merchandise. So why this little penny fuss
over drink by parcels post ?

NOTIONS
Can a female football barraclcer be a lady ?
Recent newspaper reports of a case tried in Melbourne
were headed, “ A Lady Barraeker.” It was stated in
evidence that the lady carried a flag- and barracked
till she was hoarse, making use of insulting expressions to
players. Then she charged one player with making
an insulting remark to her, and he was fined £lO for
having done so. Also having denied it, he is to be
charged with perjury. The Lady Barraeker is to be
charged with insulting behavior. It seems much safer to
be a lady in Melbourne than a mere man. A lady may
charge any citizen with a capital offence, and if the
charge fails she goes scot free. But if a football player
denies using a bad expression to a Lady Barraeker and is
disbelieved, he has to stand the racket of a perjury
prosecution.
* * * ■’*■
There were but three League matches in Mel-
bourne on Saturday, and two of them were disastrous
routs, while the collision of ’Varsity and Melbourne was
only exciting because of Uni’s hopeless inability to boot
, the hall where it was wanted most. Though Melbourne
is a game and a half behind Essendon on the list it
still has a chance for the semi-finals, inasmuch as its next
three games are much easier propositions than that with
the ’Dons, wherefore it played its darnedest. As the
students also had a “ possible ” when the episode started,
their bogging-in was equally tumultuous ; so nobody was
surprised when a Melbourne man got a rib broken and
sundry others were temporarily knocked out. ’Varsity
had much the better of the play ; but its incompetent
kicking presently got on the players’ nerves, and the last
quarter was more than willing. The students’ final
tally—two goals 15 behinds —meant the loss of all semi-
final hopes; while Melbourne’s score—four goals four
■behinds —though it gave it victory, was little to brag
abopt. The hefty ’bailers of South, refreshed by their
Sydney trip, galloped over Richmond in most unman-
nerly fashion—ll 9 points to 26 being the result thereof —
while Carlton similarly jumped on ’Roy, with 72 separate
and distinct jumps to the latter’s 21. These penultimate
collisions of the hopeless teams against the semi-final
certainties are ever a saddening circumstance, but a lot
of people seem to find great joy therein. Their cup of hap-
piness is never quite full unless their favorites have
scored about 1000 points to I—and even then they grudge
that one.
. The position of the leading Ass. clubs is more
precarious than that of the Fusionists, and no man can
say what the morrow may bring- forth. P'ran and Essen-
don are semi-final certainties. ’Scray is also a “ moral,”
but theifourth place must be filled by either Brunswick,
Brighton or ’Town, according to the points scored for and
against| either during the season. Saturday’s chief
episode| was the encounter of ’Wick and’Town. The
former was in good fettle and held its own throughout,
winning by the comfortable margin of 19 points—39 to
20. P rap’s painfully unsuccessful efforts to boot the
ball between the big posts threatened disaster until the
final quarter of its collision with Port, but a stupendous
effort at the close gave it a lead large enough for all pur-
poses—-61 to 42. Brighton kept its place in the procession
and improved its average by methodically totting up 64
points to Preston’s 23; and North capsized North-
cotb by 90 to 25, which performance would be more
promising had it happened three months earlier. Essen-
don visited the blue-stony village of ’Scray, and was
received Courteously. It returned evil for good id the
shape of a walloping, which the board diagnosed—’Don
77 points, ’Scray eight points. ’Scray has had Sonic large
experiences this year, and this writer has felt for it at
times, but a team that perpetrates a feat of that sort
only deserves the brick of scorn. At the weekly
meeting, ah~ interesting view of the sportsmanship
of delegates was afforded, when players belonging
to the ’Town and Essendon Clubs Were ■ aske.d to
excuse their conduct in a recent match. The police had
already unsuccessfully sought to prove a charge of riot l
when one of commoii assault would better have met the
case. The accused had nothing ;to remark, so the dele-
gates of P’ran, ’Scray and Brunswick, who must meet
’Don or ’Town or both, In the semi-finals, arose in
righteous anger and demanded that the offenders be fired
out 1 for the rest of the year. Doubtless they deserved
suspension, but it would have looked better if some other
delegates had recommended it. Anyhow, an admonition
was considered the correct thing, and they were ad-
monished with much severity. Among other disasters
was the upending of Coburg, of the Junior Ass., by
’Roy Juniors, the score being 119 points to nil. As a foot-
ball team, Coburg possesses the bubbling- humor of
Jocook, though it appearij to be overdoing things.
* « * *
the football of the week, however, was of the
verbal variety, and began with the uprising of J. A.
Harper, secretary and delegate of the Melbourne Football
Club, who managed the team that visited Adelaide to
play Norwood. Harper got off some weighty remarks
about the “ pernicious influence of the Victorian Associa-
tion in enticing players from the League by offering them
salaries —find so converting young fellows who played
from love of sport into mongrels, drunkards and
loafers.” Doubtless Harper, who has been a M. F.C.
official only this season, spoke in his baste.
Anyhow, the Ass. had no sooner read the report than it
calied on its lawyer, who opined that the first thing to be
done was to discover whether Harper spoke for the
League or on his own. On the question being put, the
LeagPe, like Pilate, washed its hands of the whole
business. As far as the matter has got, it''has
been arranged that Harper is to call on the
Ass] executive and explain things, or fight it out
or do whatever he thinks fit. But while he
is on the job it will be a vast pity if Harper doesn’t give
details of what he says he knows. He said that a player
of his club had told him he had been offered 30s.—a
moderate 30s.—a week to play for an Ass. club, but when
challenged to give the name he refused. Of course every-
one knows that League players have been seduced to
Ass. clubs, and that a League or any other player who is
worth enticing must, under present conditions, be given
some inducement —billet, extra expenses, or plain cash.
But Harper should have recollected (1) that the majority
of’bailers who have left the League for the Ass. have been
men whom the League clubs didn’t want, either because
they were beginning.to go down hill or for other reasons ;
(2) that, with barely half a dozen exceptions, every man
who has so ’verted has been granted a clearance bv the
League to do so ; (3) that, as far as buying players goes,
the revenue of the Ass. clubs equals about ss. to every £1
taker! by the League, so that the Ass. must either pay its
players less than the League or the latter body must blew
its cash in some mysterious way that Harper ought to
throw light on; (4) that every season dozens of rising ’bailers
leave Ass. clubs to join those of the League. While he
is on the job Harper might explain exactly why this
happens. And, as a side issue, three regular players of his
team leave their country homes and business and do a
six hours’ railway journey to play for Melbourne. Is it
solely because of their abiding love for Harper’s club?
An audited account of their expenses, with vouchers,
would answer that question. If Harper really wants to
purify the game, why doesn’t he advocate a system of
genuine district football, with stiff residential qualifica-
tions ?

Union Rugby in Sydney on Saturday was con-
fined to grade competition matches; and the star item of
the afternoon was the South Sydnev-Glebe meeting at
Sydney Cricket Ground. Some 12,000 people went out
to see things; and many of them came away disap-
pointed, because the excitement.only lasted about eight
minutes at the tail end of the game, when Glebe scored
11 points and South Sydney three. Both teams played
drearily till the people started to rush away for the home-
ward trams. Then Glebe suddenly came away and scored
a try, a field goal, and another try, which was con-
verted. But right on time South Sydney also
came with a sudden rush and scored. The kick
failed, and Glebe won by 11 points to three. It
was sensational, but bad from a business view-point.
At the University Oval the barrackers for Alma Mater
guffawed loudly at the team of cripples that hobbled on
to the field to represent Newtown, making sarcastic re-
marks about the visitors "having left their crutches at
home. But the way that crowd of cripples and frag-
ments got all over the blue-and-gold forwards made the
University barrackers weep. At half-time the premiers
were 11 points, Uni. was nil. Only once did University
cross the Newtown line, and the full-back added the
points. But it was a mere flash in the pan ; Newtown
won by 22 points to five. Down in the sheltered
park by the sea, Balmain called on Manly, and the
Villagers fell on their guests right willingly. Bal-
main responded cheerfully, and the game was a
fearsome wrestling match between vast, hulking for-
wards, in which some "of the Balmainiacs got crushed—
one of them so badly that a doctor had to be called to get
the inside works back into position. When the whistle
blew Manly was on top, and the board showed 17 points
to eight. Where once a Chinese garden bloomed and
stank—to wit, Hampden Oval—Eastern Suburbs were at
home to St. George. But the Saints got no joy out of the
visit, and after a dreary afternoon East won by nine
points to six, The Western Suburbs journeyed to North
Sydney, and treated their host just as North Sydney has
usually been treated these lonesome latter months.
Still, West let it down lightly with six points to three.
In the first-grade competition Glebe is top of
the heap with 22 points, and Newtown is only one point
behind. South Sydney is third with 20 points, and Uni-
versity a bad fourth with 14. Below this the other seven
clubs have degenerated into B division, the first four
having been separated as superior beings who hold the
premiership among them. In fact, the collective name of
the B division is Mullock.
.** * *
The All-Maori team apparently dropped its
luck during the excitement that memorable afternoon at
Sydney Agricultural Ground, when the mob raged over
the losing of the O. T. Cup. On its way north the team
was badly clawed at Newcastle, and in the northern
capital it was crushed by the local Leaguers. Truly
it got level, but on Saturday last it again struck
disaster ! in the shape of a 16 to 13 licking by
an Australian team. Asher apparently' hasn’t re-
covered from being caught on the wing by' McGregor
the previous Saturday ; he did not play, and his team
missed him sadly. It is said the Australian team spent the
night before the scrap in pray'er, and on the fateful morning
the captain read Kipling and Scripture to prove that the
way to down the Maori or any other colored fellow subject
is to bustle him from the jump. He was bustled according-
ly ; but af; the slightest easing off in the process he made
things so,lively on his own behalf that at half-time Aus-
tralia was only one point to the good (11 to 10). The second
half was amighty struggle, the Maoris making attack after
attack. But the Australians handled the leather beauti-
fully, and let, loose short passing charges that worried the
brown brethren and kept them fighting on the defensive ;
and this Caused the brown tail to wilt considerably. Then
the Australians scored, and the Maoris went baresark.
They hurled themselves en masse on the Australian line,
and strove to break through by sheer weight and force.
The Pakehas responded, and pulled them down in strug-
gling heaps, while round the ground the crowd w.ent mad
with delight. The game seemed to have devolved into a >
mere question of endurance. Tuki charged through.
He was caught and thrown out again. Then a solid wedge
of brown man rolled through the white defence, but lost
the ball, which was kicked clear. Back came the Maoris,
all in a solid mass, and out of it like a stone from a sling
flashed Tuki, right through and over the line.
The kick failed, leaving the Maoris three points to the
bad. Again they came with a rush that was magnificent,
and threatened every collarbone in the white team.
Wharepapa rolled through, but was recalled ; and Stuntz,
getting possession, took the visitors right back to their
own line. They managed to haul him down, and once
more took the leather back to the Australian line. But
time had run out. The chance was gone ; that run by
Stuntz had deprived the Brovvns of their last chance.
*, , * * * *
With the blond and glory of its defeat of the
Maoris still fresh upon it, Newcastle came to Sydney'
Agricultural Ground to do battle with South Sydney.
It was a regular Carmse. South Sydney overwhelmed
the northern team in spite of a splendid defence, and
broke through repeatedly after fighting- every inch of its
way. All that an over-matched team could do the New-
castle crowd did, but in the Northern Union game there
is no mercy for the weaker side. There is no line to save
it as in the Union game; and the side that is over-
matched is knocked out. So, under the circumstances,
Newcastle got off lightly with a2O to nil defeat. Balmain
downed Eastern Suburbs bv 15 to eight, after as fast and
rugged a game as one could wish for.
*■ * *
In the Soccer division, the Gardiner Cup com-
petition is rapidly approaching the end, the only clubs
remaining in being Pvrmont and Glebe, Rozelle A and
Adamstown. These will play in that order in the semi-
finals the coming Saturday. Then the two winners will
play' off for the possession of the liquor utensil. In the
meantime, the struggle for the Rawsori Cup continues,
and in the fight for its possession Pvrmont bn Saturday
outed Glebe by five goals to three ; Ultimo and Western
Suburbs scored a draw with one goal each ; and Rozelle
downed Balmain by one to nil. Which places Pvrmont
far in front with 27 competition points; makes Rozelle
and Granville level with 20, and leaves Balmain and Glebe
out of it with 17 and 16 respectively.
* * *
Sydney Metropolitan Rugby Union received the
shock of its life at the beginning of the week, when the
League boldly approached the Wallaby team with a
brazen bid of £5O per man to cross over en masse , and
play a series of matches with the Kangaroos and Maoris.
The Wallabies were thrown into a state of tremendous
excitement, and at time of writing were holding lengthy
though surreptitious discussions as to whether they
should leap or not. A 1 50 bonus and a percentage of the
proceeds is a tempting bait to put before a poor wallab.v ;
but the animal is wondering whether, if he jumps, he will
land in affluence or oblivion.
* * * *
The sum of £l5OO in all— £l2oo of it to go to the
winner—brought a field of 11 only to the post for the
Australian Steeplechase at Caulfield last Saturday. Seem-
ingly the old stagers that stopped away lost nothing by
their absence. The finish was left to the pair—Bribery
and Confederate—that had the same distinction in the
Grand National last month, but in this case Confederate
did the trick. The burden of 13st. 71b. proved a bit too
much for Bribery over the four miles, and though the
top-weight tackled his old opponent at the last fence and
kept level with him for the next 80yds. or so, he dropped
away and was beaten, easing up, by several lengths.
Grafnax finished a very bad third, and the others fell or
were beaten off. And now the punters who have been
dropping their money over the “sticks” can give all their
attention to the task of picking losers on the flat.
* * * *
It’s hard to find a reason why, every year, a lot
of hopelessly bad horses are entered for the Caulfield and
Melbourne Cups. They are let in at the lowest weight
that’s going. The handieapper can do no more for them ;
vet they seem bound to be scratched—most of them
before the first forfeit falls due. In both of the Cups this
year more than 60 entrants were handicapped at 6st. 71b.
—the minimum weight; and it is among this division
that the largest proportion of early slaughter is found.
Still there are 38 bottom weights remaining in the Mel-
bourne Cup out of a total “ first acceptance ” of 171.
The fifth and final Test ended in a draw, so the
“ashes” remain with Australia. So far as England is
concerned, rain often ends matches abruptly ; and it is
doubtful if it would not be better to limit the number of
Tests to three and play them right, out, if they took a week
each. Anyone who is fool enough to waste three days
would probably not grudge a week if it decided which
was really the best team.
CRICKETER BARDSLEY.

There could be no stronger proof of cricket
having lost popularity as a gate-money entertainment in
England than the cabled announcement that nearly
22,000 paid for admission to Kennington Oval on the
second day of the fifth test match, and that on the third
day “the attendance had increased to 15,000 after
luncheon” —the weather being genial on both "days.
Bigger crowds gathered at Test matches 20 years ago,
when the population of London was fully 1,500,000 less
than it is to-day, and travelling facilities were not so
great. In Australia the doings of Our Boys are no longer
a matter for excited discussion at street corners.
Cricket is not now taken so seriously as it
was by the previous generation. It isn’t suffici-
ently quick and lively for the times, and the
fact that a three days’ or two days’ match between
two teams of approximately even powers is apt to be de-
cided by luck rather than skill is felt to be a reason for
diminished enthusiasm. Australia may be strong enough
to win all five of the “ Test ” matches, so-called, but if a
Test team meets Surrey, Yorkshire, or Lancashire, and
the county gets_ the use of a hard. W_Lcket, .and Australia
is fated to bat on a very soft one—down goes
Australia. These sudden changes of the wicket—
the rule rather than the exception in Eng-
land, and not exceptional in Australia—are “all in
the game,” but they rob the result of all value as a record
of the relative skill of the two teams. Evidently the
English system of limiting a match to three days is less
unfair to the records than the Australian system would
be. What could be more childishly absurd than the
spectacle of 22 men playing their match to a finish
after a first dry day had been succeeded by two or
three days of soaking rain ? Yet this absurdity
might happen under the loose regulation which was
lately introduced for the obtaining of a satisfactory
“Test.” Had the score been “two all” when Australia
met All England at the oval last week, the game which
was “drawn” would have had to be played out. Dry
weather prevailed through the three days, but the rain
that stopped many of the other matches and interrupted
one of the Tests might have ensured a farcical result for
this one. How ridiculous is the new regulation,
anyhow ! Only in the event of each side having won
the same number of games, or neither side hav-
ing won a single game, was this fifth Test to be
played out for certain. Had three of the four previous
Tests been “ drawn ” in favor of the side that lost the
first one, this last Test might also have been “ drawn ” in
their favor, and then the weaker team would have been
adjudged winners of the set, though it had practically
been beaten by four games to one. No wonder that the
devotees of baseball in America, and of tennis in Aus-
tralia and England, regard cricket as a pastime for boys
rather than a game of emulation for “ champions.”
Looking back at the five Tests it seems that the
Australians batted nervously in the first game, the
Englishmen were completely funk-stricken in at least
two of the succeeding games, and the Australian bowling
was the stronger all the time. With no new bowlers of the
same trustworthy calibre as the best of their old hands,
with whose methods the visitors were familiar, the English-
men resorted to the desperate expedient of trying Carr,
the “ googler,” in the final game of the series. Carr took
seven wickets at an average cost of 35 runs, or so. As to
the batting, it seems pretty certain “ on averages” that
a team picked from two of the strongest English counties
could score as many runs, as a rule, against the rest of
all England as the Australian Eleven could, whereas the
supposititious Rest of England would probably score a
lot more runs against the combination team than if it
had Australian bowling and fielding to deal with. But
from the published “averages” of a cricket season any-
thing may. be argued and nothing proved, except that
the Australians seem best able to do their utmost when the
Test strain is applied.
* * * *
The Australians bumped a snag at the end of
last week in “ An English X 1.," which piled up 567, the
highest total yet recorded against the Board of Control
team. The bowling suffered heavily, O’Connor’s six
wickets costing 210 runs, and Hopkins getting three for
106. Australia replied with 326 and 390 for seven wickets,
Trumper flashing out with 150 in 115 minutes. In three
days 1283 runs were scored —which must have been worth
watching. The three.days’limit made it a draw.
Billiardist Fred Lindrum failed badly in his
attempt to concede boy Gray 23 )0 in 16,000 at Billiards
Ltd., Sydney, during the past fortnight. The youth won
by 3957,1657 more than the handicap. Gray’s breaks were
horrifying to Lindrum. Imagine the feelings of a man
who has given an opponent a huge handicap and then
sees him wade in with breaks of 530 (528 being off the red,
which is a record), 574, 466, 406, 372, 350, 349 and 317.
That is how Lindrum felt. He made breaks also,
but only once did he pass the 300 meridian. . Then he
soared up to 380. They will meet again in Melbourne,
but Gray will receive only 1000 in a 16,000 game. Why
he should receive anything is a mystery.
The N. S. Wales Hockey team reached Mel-
bourne last week to gave the Weary Staters their revenge,
they having lost the first of such matches in Sydney last
year. On the trip over N. S. Wales capsized Wangaratta
(Vic.) by six goals to nil, and afterwards watched their vic-
tims capsize, figuratively that is, the Shepparton girls’
team by one goal to nil. On Saturday the Ma-Staters,
cheered by the presence of a sizable crowd, got going
early, and shot three goals to the Vies.’ one before
half-time. The latter’s driving was elegant, but
the visitors beat them in stopping and passing.
After the interval the light blues struck bad
luck, Captain Clyde getting a smite on the ear that in-
valided him for a space, and forward Massey acquiring
damages that necessitated his being carried off the ground
in disorder. After that the dark blues drove the ball
into the net once, and when the bell rang the record was
N.S.W. three goals, Victoria two, after a strenuous and
pleasing encounter.

The N.S.W. Dunlop inter-club premiership con-
test got no further forward on Saturday last. Western
Suburbs and Sydney dead-heated w'ith 18 points each,
and, while the riders stood round with their tongues
hanging out, the executive argued the point. In the'end
it was decided to order the dead-heaters to run off on
Saturday next, to decide which of them will meet Bal-
main in the final on the 28th. A dead heajfe is an
unsatisfactory thing.
The Alan Fergusson tragedy conveys a lesson.
Mr. Fergusson was cruising with his wife, two friends and
a driver, off the Scottish coast, w'hen an oil stove, used
for cooking, upset and the petrol caught, with the result
that the boat became a veritable inferno. The party
escaped into the water on lifebelts. The host, his wife
and driver were drowned, and the two friends rescued.
The moral of it is that the practice of using
oil and spirit stoves that are unfixed is highly dangerous,
and should be dropped instanter. If it is desirable to
boil the billy or do any cooking the oil or spirit stove
should be about the most firmly fixed part of the craft’s
fittings. Moreover, it should be installed as far as pos-
sible from the petrol tank or the engine. Up to date
there has been remarkable immunity from accident; but
the loose oil or spirit lamp is a deliberate tempting of
Providence.

They are making considerable fuss in England
because the Wolseley-built motor boat Swiftsure will run
from Cowes to St. Petersburg, a distance of 1600 miles,
under its own power. It is a 70ft. boat, installed with
twin screws and 160-h.p. engines, and is capable of 16
knots, although the cruising speed is 12. The proposed
voyage may be remarkable, but it has been beaten in
Australia, most notably by Dr. Cecil Vaughan, who in a
80ft. motor boat, driven by a 4-h.p. single cylinder
engine, ran from Sydney to Sainarai, a distance of over
2000 miles. Admittedly, the little boat had the
shelter of the Barrier Reef for 1000 miles; but
it had some ugly water for another 1000 miles without
any shelter. Another 30ft. launch, the Aimee, has twice
travelled between Sydney and Melbourne, exposed to the
storms and chances of the Tasman Sea. But an even
smaller boat, measuring only 24ft. over all, fitted with a
mere 6-h.p. engine, battled from Adelaide to Melbourne,
a distance of 504 miles, through the roughest water on
the Australian coast and in stormy weather. These
gentlemen of Europe are a long way behind the times.

The announcement that Jeffries had signed
articles and deposited forfeits to fight Johnson cut no ice
in either Yankeedom or the outside world. Johnson is
known as “ the Big Smoke,” and Jeffries is in a fair way
to earn the title of “ the Big Squib.” Hardly was the ink
of the announcement dry before big Jim was qualifying
it and making a string of reservations. That Jeffries
would, if in condition, wallop Johnson is generally
believed ; but not one man in 10,000 appears to believe
that the ex-boilermaker will try. Yankeedom has
dropped Jeffries and taken on Stanley Ketchell, and all
this cabling and splashing round on the part of Jeffries
merely represents his gigantic efforts to get back into the
middle of the limelight.

Middleweights Ed. Williams, of Port Mel-
bourne, and Arthur Cripps created a mild disturb-
ance at the Brisbane Stadium—any old thing is a
Stadium nowadays. For 20 rounds the pair dealt out
biff that never approached stoush, what time the sun
baked them like pancakes. The Cripps who faced the
lengthy Victorian on this occasion was a cheap edition
of the former mid-champion. He never showed a glimpse
of dash, and lacked the necessary stamina'to keep Williams
moving ; so Williams made his own pace, kept Arthur
facing the sun, and put it all over him from gong to gong-.
About the 13th round Arthur inspired his well-wisheis
with a gleam of hope ; so the valets applied the ice and
towels with vigor ; but his effort gradually fizzled out,
and Eddy kept on piling up points. The tail end of the
engagement saw quantities of clinching and little fight,
and when the tally reached the 20th round the pair were
mostly cuddling. After which club-whirler Tom Burrowes
concluded his duties,by cheerfully announcing “ Williams
the winner.”

“ Silas Snell ” : “ Gentleman ” Jack McGowan,
who had been in possession of the Commonwealth light-
weight championship for a few months, had a call from
Tommy Jones, the Sydney featherweight, at Jenkins’
“punch bowl” —the-Cyclorama, on ,Eastern Hill, Mel-
bourne —the other Monday, and 20 rounds of cautious
fighting went all the way of Mr. Jones. Jones’s pugilistic
policy is one of defence, not defiance. He props a rigid
right before his right eye, which, by the way, is swivelled
like an auger, and keeps it there or thereabouts to stop
anything dangerous the enemy may hurl in his direction.
He has a most effective lock when close in, too.
For the rest he shoots a speedy left that is
like a spear. That left was in McGowan’s face
all night, and it made a considerable difference
in Jack.v’s configuration before 10 rounds had gone. John
would probably have had no head left had there been a
lumpier boy behind the thrust. McGowan got in two
fairly effective body punches for his share, but Jones was
the winner on points, with heaps of surplus. The mill
suggested things. For a long time pug patrons —old time
style—who derided the newer, quicker, more defensive
manner of ring fighting made in America, were wont to
declare that one of the punishing whirlers of a decade
ago would make a meal of a bunch of the present
fanciful, quick, evasive fellows. Jack McGowan
in particular was mentioned in my hearing again
and again as the stamp of game, tough, de-
structive puncher who would hit the heads off the
later generation. Jacky had his chance of proving this
when he put them up to Jones. Jones is a light feather
and a mere kid ; but he is a good sample of the later
scientific age. McGowan could do nothing with him.
Jacky’s strength and slogging power were wasted on the
desert air ; the wasp that stung him was always else-
. where when Jack’s mighty swipe reached the space
recently occupied by Jones. To be sure, Johnnie is on
the old side, but he is still strong and well-kept. His
rugged methods are those that won him scores of battles
in the past, and this night’s demonstration was sufficient
to convince me that what is is best.

The modern athlete is the showman par excel-
lence. A pug spends a few minutes in the roped arena
once a year, damaging the countenance of another pug,
who is getting £8,000,000, “win, lose, or draw,” andputs
in. the rest of the twelve months basking in the lime-
light before an admiring multitude. Talk about the
worship of muscle in the days of ancient Greece! Ye
gods ! Greece was never in it ! Richard Arnst, the
100-h.p. sculler, is the latest athlete to feel the lure of the
limelight. He is not content, however, to take £5473
per week and let a manager rake in the rest of the profit.
Richard is after the whoie pot, so he has taken the mana-
gerial responsibility upon his own shoulders, and is touring
Maoriland with the flickergraph pictures of the last race
with Webb on the Webbanui. The pictures flicker
nightly, and Dick gives exhibitions on a home rower.

WHAT IS CATARRH ?
CATARRH is inflammation of the lining
membrane of the nose and adjoining'
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nasa. cartilages. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you
want relief and cure? If so, try our
great remedy.

Ex- Postmaster-General Thomas has a motion
n the business paper of the House of Reps.,
declaring that the Commonwealth should pay
old-age pensions to every citizen over 65, no
matter whether the citizen is rich or poor. But,
as usual, Thomas doesn’t go into the financial side
of the matter, and say where the tnonev is to come
from. If the money is vaguely left for the Govern-
ment of the moment to provide in a general
way, the chances are that it will be pretty
often borrowed. Anyway, that’s practically
how the Fusion Government is providing
even the present old-age pensions—it pro-
poses to pay for them out of loans. In
other words, instead of this generation keeping its
own old people it is meeting the bill with I O IT’s
payable by the next generation. Even the 1.0. F.
Kea Indian assessment-insurance fake wasn’t
quite as bad as that. It at any rate collected
enough to pay current benefits, even though it
'i'u n -w :l “ V enough to provide for future ones,
ihe r usion, however, isn’t even collecting enough
to pay current benefits ; and if Thomas’s motion
were carried the position would only be made
worse instead of better.

The Sydney Evening News has “jumped Jim
Crow, and now comes out as an opponent of the
Greater Sydney proposition. It obviously holds
a brief for the suburban aldermanic horde. Turn
over a garbage heap in anv suburban street, and an
alderman runs from under it—or a council clerk, or
an overdraft, or deficit, or a plague rat, each with
the latest edition of the Noose in its posses-
? lon ‘ |- n 1902 the Noose made an inspir-
lrj” fight f or the supercession of the 40 or
1 1 . or , 1040, or is it 1,000,040 councils
winch trip each other up around Sydney. Now
it scouts the idea, and eats its old sentiments
According to the Noose, the whole thing is a
question of “ rates, rates, rates,” and so bigoted
is it in regard to the word “rates,” that it won’t
even allow the question to be considered as to
whether a reduction of rate* might not be the
outcome of a general sweeping away of un-
necessary aldermen, councils, officers and flummerv
generally.
jj® Paralysing to note how the administration
ot the Victorian Pure Foods Act is being hindered
by the awful Jaypee. Two Carlton varieties of
the species had before them a milkman who was
charged with “having impeded an inspector of
Uie Board of Health in the execution of his duty ”
Ihe charge really should have read, “ flying from
"" ln .spector of the Board of Health at from 20 to
A) miles an hour, and refusing to stop when called
U P ( T n -” The cowjuice purveyor had bolted like a
mad rabbit from the man who wanted to sample
the stuff in his cans, and he would have escaped
altogether only that the inspector chanced to be
cruising in a motor car, and so was enabled to
chase the fugitive round Carlton until he had
noted the name on the cart. During the pursuit,
the inspector avers he saw something that
looked like water pouring from the back of
the cart; however as he was not able to
catch any in his hat for analysis, the stuff
might just as well have been gin. The double
•Jaypee listened solemnly to the galloping nar-
rative. and looked extra wise when the milkman
advanced the plea that his horse had been
frightened by the car. Then the owls of Justice
said that there had been a lot of contradictory
evidence, and that they were “inclined to accept
defendant s version.” The case would be dis-
missed with one guinea costs ! As soon as the
Oourt had recovered itself, the barrister who was
appearing for the prosecution arose and said, in a
choking voice, “I need hardly say we will seek
for a review of this decision.” The chances are
that the Board of Health will nail its milkman
next time ; but it is saddening to think that
violent is liable to happen to the Bench
with the fatal inclination to accept the version of
defendant in the face of 14 tons of circumstantial
evidence.
When old David Berry, of the N.S.W.
South Coast, left John Hay his estates, he loaded
them up with so many charges for legacies, etc.,
that, instead of being a millionaire, John Hav
only ‘‘cut up” for £139,706. The estate was
valued gross at £410,572; but there apparently
were debts to the tune of £270,866—and Walter
-tlall the Mount Morganaire, and now about the
wealthiest man in N. S. Wales, could probably
tell whose money most of that £270,866 is. Hav
makes a scatter of his own little lot. though his
half-brother, Alexander Hay. gets £50,000. The
Ooolangatta estate will probably be passed over
to a co., consisting wholly or mainly of the bene-
nciaries, so the chances are that it won’t be put
on the market. Among a crowd of othfers, Dr.
Immigration” Arthur’s wife—a niece of John
■Hay— gets £lO,OOO.
The State Frights bogey is being held up to
frighten Mount Gambier and the south-east corner
of b Aus. off the short, straight track that leads
mu P °: t a , nd J V ;?-)’ their natural deep-sea port.
J-he Adelaide Register, which isn’t a Little
Australian as a rule, is horrified at the district’s
perfidy and implores the Mount Gambier-Port-
land railway leaguers to stop their “ treason in
the interests of the Adelaide merchants, of
course. But the south-eastern province is “lost,”
tor the drift towards its natural channels of trade
has become a flood since Federation broke down
the Customs barriers, which previously kept the
stream flowing sinuously and slowly over the 305
miles to Adelaide. It was no doubt'a fine thing for
Adelaide ; but it was a cruel handicap on the dis-
None of the N.S.W. trustee cos. got the
handling of the late John Hay’s big Berry and
Goolangatta estate. The nearest they came to
it was when the big landlord made the late F T
Humphrey one of his two executors, Humphrey
being dnurman of the Perpetual Co.; but when
that shrewd old financier died, David Roxburgh
was put in his place. So the estate stays with the
ancient legal firm of Norton, Smith and Co. Old
Dr. Norton was David Berry’s solicitor; he
became ii doctor at the same time as Dr. John
W Pino onnT t le re ason-David Berrv’s
wLi: xt' 00 . 0 be( f" est , to St. Andrew’s University.
When Norton quitted practice, Robert Smith, his
partner, become the estate’s solicitor ; and in his
fhnniv a *T* n ?\ r - en ?> embers Smith to the extent of
ijIOOO. But it is Roxburgh, a younger member of
the estate W J ° lnS orton executor of
IS. S. W . lias just revised its gaol regula-
tions—in some respects for the better. The old-
time barbarity of nine months’ “solitary” has
dwindled down considerably—first offenders in
the future will do two weeks’ lonesomeness;
second offenders four weeks, and others up to
eight weeks. Prisoners will be graded into three
classes according to conduct, etc., with privileges
corresponding to classification. The broad arrow
vanishes from the prison uniforms, and the
only future badge will be the number of
the mess and division mark on the left
•arm; also prisoners in transit from,, one
gaol to another will wear private clothes.
The new regulations have done something more
they have booted two dozen “permanent and re-
productive works” on to the scrap-heap In
other words, they have closed up 24 country gaols
as being no longer necessary; and now Bourke
Braid wood. Casino, Cobar, Cooma, CoonambJe’
Cootamundra, Cowra, Glen Innes, Gnnd'agai Gun-
nedah, Inverell, Moree, Mudgee, Narrabri] Nar-
randera, Orange, Singleton, Tenterfield, Wagga
Walgett. Wellington, Wyalong and Yass have
commodious and unpaid-for premises to let. (The
famous Berrima was knocked out some time back,
and is now occupied by a caretaker and sundry
ghosts and spiders). The only thing the new
regulations seem to have left undone was to pay
the bill for these 24 permanent works.
After publicly declaring that the big
estates were vanishing like snow-wreaths, Squat-
ters J. G. Ritchie and J. N. Maearthur, of the
Victorian Western District, went down to the
annual meeting of the Pastoralists’ Association,
and formed portion of 24 squatters that were
elected on the council. And the 24 pan out—so
far as the Western District is concerned—some-
thing like this:—W. J. T. Armstrong (30 000
acres), W. Armstrong (0800), H. Armytage
(25,972), E. Austin (20,075), T. Beggs (14,723),

1 hese sort of people “ meet the demand for farms ”
all right. They meet it with an axe and a gun
and a dog, and when these are insufficient thev
try laying poison. J

Ihe unhealthy, sallow complexion, the drawn, lifeless skin,
pimpled and freckled, the dark rings encircling the eyes, and
that languid and unwell feeling tell of a disorganised system,
arising from imperfect digestion, a general lack of energy of
tie organs of the body, and last, but not least, it denotes the
presence of painful womanly diseases, which undermine the
general health.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a Great Female

free and regular visitation, dry debilitating drains, heal inflammation and
ulceration, and cure all womanly weaknesses. They are a perfect blood

boils, and for female ailments. That Dr. Morse’s Indian Root

HEADACHES BANISHED.
At one time I was a great sufferer from headaches,” writes
Mrs. W. McGuire, Randolph Street, Newton, Auckland, “and
was often affected with a pain in the side, which, I understood,
proceeded from the liver. About two years ago I was induced
to give your pills a trial, and the results have been most satis-

headache is since using: these pills, and a dose occasionally keeps
me in splendid health. I have recommended your pills to
everybody and I know of dozens of cases where the effect has
been marvellous. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are indeed a
splendid corrective, specially adapted to women’s complaints.”
KIDNEY COMPLAINT.
Mrs. M. A. Jordan, Madden Street, West Devonport (Tas )
writes: “For many months I suffered from kidney ailments
and severe headaches, and finally I became very ill, losing flesh
until I became (as many of my friends said) practically a living
skeleton. Life was a burden to me. One day I would manage
to do my household duties, and the next I would be totally
incapacitated. The pains across my back were terrible. I had
tried all sorts of remedies and different kinds of pills ; but could
find no relief at all. I was at last urged to try Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills by a friend who had found much good in

Rupture is a Most Dangerous Complaint.
If you have rupture—no matter how slight the trouble may
appear to be—you are in danger.
Rupture is a progressive complaint, and though your slight
attack may appear quite free from risk to=day, it may be
dangerous to=morrow.
The wearing of a truss must undermine the constitution, and
can do no permanent good.
The DR. J. A. SHERMAN METHOD
WILL AiSOLUTELY CUM RUPTURE.
We have many cases on our records where the patient has
suffered 10, 20, or even 50 years, and been cured at last.
Relief is immediate, and there is no detention from your
ordinary business.
Here is a letter that will interest you :
Cheltenham Road, Devonport, Auckland, N.Z.
Mr. A. W. Martin. 3rd May, 1905.
Dear Sir, —Unsolicited, I beg to offer you my sincere thanks for the kindness I received when I
consulted you in regard to the complaint I was suffering from ; also to testify to the great pleasure
and relief I have experienced from Dr. .1. A. Sherman’s INVALUABLE METHOD OF TREATMENT
OF RUPTURE as-applied by you. To those suffering from rupture I would recommend them to con-
sult you, and obtain, as I have done; Dr. Sherman’s treatment. Two years ago I ruptured myself
lifting a ladder out of a well 26ft. deep. About seven months afterwards I received a truss and
directions as to treatment, which I strictly 7 observed. I wore the truss about six months, but had to
discontinue wearing’ it owing to the constant pain and agony I suffered. I was afraid to eat what
was necessary to keep my system up, and allowed myself to run down until I could not stand
upright. Fortunately I saw your advertisement in the Auckland papers, and consulted you, and
obtained Dr. Sherman’s method of treatment. Although lam within eight months of 80 years of age,
lam now able to walk about almost as straight as I did before I met with this misfortune. lam
well, known in Auckland and Devonport, having been an officer of the City 7 Council of Auckland for
the period of 28 years. I will be pleased to tell anyone that is suffering from rupture the relief I
had experienced since obtaining your treatment, but cannot reply 7 to any letters. You can use this
letter as you like, as I consider Dr. J. A. Sherman’s method of treatment of rupture SHOULD
BE MADE KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD.
With 'kind wishes, and may you have success unbounded.
. I remain, yours sincerely, .
(Mr. Goldie now wears no appliance.) . GEORGE N. GOLDIE.

“Melb.”: The Footscray (Vic.) Jubilee Book
touches on the great industries which are the backbone
of that suburb, furnishing it with a much sounder founda-
tion and better guarantee of employment than in any
other around Melbourne. In addition to such huge con-
cerns as the Colonial Sugar Refinery and Miller’s rope
works there are three superphosphate establishments,
Cuming, Smith and Co., the Mount Lyell, and Wischer’s.
They can produce 100,000 tons yearly. The Mount Lyell
mine utilises highrgrade sulphurous pyrites in the manu-
facture of sulphuric acid for superphosphate, as an
adjunct to its Tasmanian smelting. The phosphate comes
from the South Sea Islands. Michaelis, Hallenstein and
Co.’s Footscray tannery’ has a capital of £'200,000, and
a gold medal from the London Franco-British Ex-
hibition. Mephan Ferguson is the most remarkable
Footscray’an, with his engineering works. Began
single-handed in 1875. Got his big start through
furnishing the Melbourne Water Supply with wrought
iron and steel pipes instead of cast iron. Next came the
adoption of his spiral-seam pipe. There are over 70 miles
of them in the Melbourne Water Supply. Hundreds of
miles of his smaller spirally-riveted pipes are in use
throughout Australia and Maoriland, also in Ceylon tea
plantations and Malay jungles. After rigorous tests
against all the world, his lock-bar or rivetless pipe was
adopted for the Coolgardie Water Supply (360 miles). He
filled a large contract in Tipton, Staffordshire, England ;
moulded the giant piers of the Murray bridge at Swan
Hill ; made all the ironwork for the Government loco-
motive shops at Newport, and the Sewage Pumping
Station, Spottiswood. Also he made the largest boilers
overbuilt in Australia. Angliss’s Meat Freezing Works,
Footscray, pay about £20,000 a year in wages.
Apparently some shindykit or other still has an
idea of laying hold of the Yarra away up at Warrandyte,
where the fall is considerable and the gorges deep, and
harnessing it for power purposes. In a Victorian
Government Gazette lately one Vernon A. E. Thomas
notified his intention to apply for a license to divert
seven-eighths of the stream for manufacturing and other
purposes. Seven-eighths removed from the rivulet
wouldn’t leave much more than a copious street drain,
so the councils lower down are objecting strenuously ;
but as Thomas aforesaid must necessarily return his
seven-eighths w'hen he has done with it, it doesn’t appear
as if much harm would result, except that it would give
a shindykit control over a power supply which ought to
be harnessed up by the public to satisfy its Own extensive
needs. „ i

Here’s one Maorilander, anyhow, who has got
over the mania, and plumps now for O.O.I). principles—
the advt. comes from a Nelson paperH. J. COLLINS,
bootmaker, finding his past disorderly methods of con-
ducting his business has resulted in failure and confusion,
desires to intimate to his valued customers, and the public
o-enerally, the necessity of doing only a cash business,
until things are altered and better order brought in.
* * * *
Irrigation Expert Mead, havirig considered
matters, has come to the conclusion that if Victorian
farmers would use the water that the State has brought to
them, the charge for it could be reduced to ss. per acre
per foot of water. This would be about the cheapest
water supply on earth ; anyhow, Mead doesn’t know any
place where it is cheaper. But the farmers at Swan Hill and
thereabouts, perceiving that Mead, if he gets his way,
will presently make them pay for the water they can use
but won’t, immediately set up a scarifying wail to the
effect that thej r couldn’t possibly pay this little sum.
It would ruin them. They couldn’t make a living
on irrigation with water at that price. And, be-
sides, they didn’t want the water, anyway. Then
Mead pleasantly remarked that the old Swan Hill Irriga-
tion Trust, which mismanaged the local irrigation busi-
ness before it was taken over by the State, had been in
the habit of charging Is. per inch per acre, which was
more than double what he proposed to charge. Just then
the. Swan Hill landowners remembered thattheir old Trust,
though it had charged 12s. per acre-foot, had seldom col-
lected the money, but had passed the bill on to the State,
whereupon a great silence supervened. Even the
northern farmers are smitten with shame when those old
Water Trusts are mentioned nowadays.
* * * *
Though the hanks threw out a sprat or two the
other day to choke a mackerel, and decided that they
wouldn’t charge exchange on bank notes presented “in
reasonable amounts,” they followed that up by dropping
a stinging-little cracker in a few people’s pockets. The
big banks, having branches pretty well everywhere, have
been expected by some people to do all sorts of odd jobs
when these people wanted odd job? done away from
home; and any morning the branch manager was
liable to open his mail and find a letter from
a citv office intimating that out esteemed client
Mr. Blazes would be glad if the bank’s manager at Solong
would see to the shipment of a ton of pickled porcupines.
Also, they have been expected to hunt up all kinds of docu-
ments, and run an eye over them to see that they were in
order. At last the banks have got very tired of doing all
these odd jobs for nothing, wherefore they agreed to
make agency charges for agency business; and the
people who 'have hitherto had a lot of work done for
nothing are feeling a nasty sensation in their pockfets.
* * * *
The murderously-big wheat-bag seems as hard
to scotch as the bunny, the cactus nuisance, 'or the
cigarette habit. It was thought that the evil would he
killed dead bv the proclamation of ex-Customs Minister
Chapman prohibiting the import of overweight sacks,
but it appears that certain crafty inhumans have crawled
some of the way round the law. As they can’t- import
the oversize sack as a whole, they are importing it in the
piece, and haiing it sewn together locally. The present
Customs Minister is now studying that aspect of the
annoyance, and is thinkingof issuing another proclama-
tion, forbidding the import of jute piece-goods over 23in.
in width. Yet even with that order in existence, people
mav still find a way to escape the humane intention of
the' law ar.d slay their fellows. If the State Government
were to refuse to carry over-sized bags on the railways,
the wickedness would suffer sudden death ; but the State
Governments don't move.
THE BELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
(Parodies are mostly accursed, but this one utters a
great truth, and reaches the inmost soul.)
Hear the telephonic bell—
Blow the hell !
What a heap of tribulation
In that constant sound can dwell,
With its tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.
Blast the men that seem to think all
I have got to do is listen to the bell !
Ringing up, ringing up all the time
On the slightest provocation,
Or on none —
Oh, Hell !
Does the rotter think that I’m
Under any obligation,
Just for fun,
To go answering the tinkle of his bell,
Of his bell, bell, bell, bell, bell —
Blasted bell!
Though the editor says parodies are off,
It’s the darned machine that has to take the blame,
I might have written epics like a toff
In the happy days before the tinkle came.
Oh ! ring off !
Oh ! Hell—
There it goes again !
To the tintinabulation of its truculent refrain,
The bell, bell, bell, bell, bell—
Blasted bell !
A hundred times this morning it’s been ringing,
With my ears, and heart., and liver all a-singing,
And the things Poe never wrote
In a tin-pot ditty float
From the bell.
Oh, my nerves have gone to wreck,
And I want to wring its neck,
And work my wicked will upon that bell,
And send that blasted telephone to Hell—
That telephone to tinkle down in Hell, Hell, Hell,
Hell, Hell !
MAORILAND.

“ Tt glves me great P leasure in stating that I consider the Grand Pianoforte, which you exhibited at the Franco-British Exhibition, a very
first-rate instrument. I much enjoyed playing on the same. The touch is excellent, likewise the tone—l especially admired the wonderful tone of the
bass. In fact I hardly remember a pianoforte with a more resonant sound, and Australia may be very proud of your having produced such a fine
instrument.

WOOD-MILNE Rubber Heels have
revolutionised footwear. The old-
fashioned leather heel is rapidly
becoming obsolete. It is universally
recognised to-day that rubber is the
correct substance for . boot-heels,
softens the shock of walking on hard
streets, and gives ease and vigour to the
walk. Moreover, Wood-Milne Rubber
lasts far longer than leather, and so
prevents the boot from losing shape.

Eureka! Eureka! Eureka!
I have not been looking for the PHILOSO-
PHER’S STONE, but I have by assiduous study
for over THIRTY YEARS delved deep into
NATURE’S vast storehouse, and by practical
experimental research have, step by step, acquired
information of such a practical character that I
am now in a position to treat advanced cases of
baldness with every possibility of success. In-
deed, cases which were thought to be quite beyond
any possibility of success are yielding to my
LATEST DISCOVERIES.
A gentleman writing from Queensland says :
“ Your preparations are doing wonders for my
hair. I had only a thin CROP OF DOWN on
the top of my head ; now it is becoming REAL
HAIR, and is growing thick and strong. I wish
you every success in your great work.”
Another gentleman writes from W.A. “I
am one of three brothers. We have all been
bald for years. One of my brothers had heard
so much of your successful treatment of the hair
that he sent for four months’ treatment to give it
a trial. After he had used it for about three
months A NEW CROP of line, healthy hair

started to grow, and it is now doing well. We
are so satisfied with the result that I want you to
send me four months’ treatment, also four months’
for another brother, and two months’ treatment for
my brother whose hair you have been treating.”
A Mr. Constab (W.A.) writes :—“ My scalp,
which was in a very bad condition, has become
more healthy-looking, and the irritation is all
gone. A splendid crop of THICK, STRONG,
HEALTHY HAIR is now growing on the BALD
PART of my head.”
These Letters and hundreds more can be seen

IN BANANA LAND
“San Remo”: Joe Lesina, who has been
writing to Brisbane Courier a series of articles
on long hours, low wages and bad times in
Maoriland would do well to give some of his atten-
tion to the sweating evil in Brisbane. Right here
on the Courier’s door-mat, the Bootmaking In-
dustrial Board has fixed the minimum wage for
senior male bootmakers (skilled men) at the
magnificent figure of 40s. a week. Also, at a
recent session, the Board granted eight permits
under the old, slow and infirm clause to enable
that number of workers to toil for less than two
score shillings per week. Lesina speaks of
Maoriland seamstresses making men’s shirts and
women’s underclothing at fid. and 7d. per article.
I can show him factories at Woollongabba, making
these same goods at 2s. fid. per dozen, and men’s
cotton tweed trousers and dungaree pants at 7s.
per dozen. There is no need for Lesina to go so
far afield as Maoriland for instances of sweating.
Perhaps, though, the Courier prefers to print
articles about the sweater at a distance.
“Bilbax,” from North Queensland :
This is the faithful and true narrative of my trip as a
first-saloon (find your own blankets and whisky) pas-
senger in the cutter Thistle from Port Stewart for Cook,
town. There were six of us aboard : skipper, two sea-
men, cook, self and another passenger. Our cargo was a
young alligator in a cage and a stallion in a horse-box on
deck, some tin ore and cockroaches. Second day out
when slumbering on the hatch-covering I suddenly took
an upright position, jumped forward and was well up the
rigging before the yell that galvanised me had ceased.
It was the cook—and the alligator. The 'gator had
broken his cage, sneaked below and bitten a piece off
that part of the cook that usually obstructed the entrance
to the tiny galley when he was busy. Cooky was along-
side me now; the others were up the rigging aft ; the
’gator was waiting under us for another bite ; and the
boat was drifting on to the Barrier Reef. “He’ll stay by
you, cook, if you come a bit lower,” yelled the skipper,
“ and it’ll give me a chance to lash the tiller.” But the
cook was narked, and said he’d see the skipper in Hell
first. His duty was below, though it pleased him just
now to take an airing on deck, as he was justly entitled
to do. It was the skipper’s business to sail the ship, and
let him do his dooty like a man.
Five minutes later she bumped, and the Merciful Pro-
vidence that watches those who go down to the deep in
ships so ordained it that the Thistle heeled over enough to
capsize the horse-box ; and the alligator went to breakfast
on the horse. The hour of revenge had come. Cooky
darted below, got the skipper’s Winchester and put two
bullets into the ’gator ; who peacefully turned on his
back and breathed his final.
We gazed silently and reverently at the dead till the
spell was broken by another stampede of all hands. The
cutter was settling down, and the cockroaches were
coming on deck—billions of them. How we heaved the
boat over and fell into her! Next morning, from our
camp on the beach, we saw a queer transformation of the
rigging that still stood out of the water. The ropes were
thickened to cables, and decorated with huge lumps like
those basket-balls that we used for port time-signals.
We rowed over to investigate. It was the cockroaches
thickly covering everything, and here and there clustered
like beehives. We didn’t disturb them.
“San Remo”: Re Governor Norman’s
reminiscences of Bananaland politics (B. 8/7/’O9).
Norman was quite right about the Northern
Separation movement being engineered mostly by
land speculators. The moveffient for separation
in Central Queensland had for its godfather G. S.
Curtis, a Rockhampton merchant and an invet-
erate land speculator till land speculating ruined
him. Curtis was member for Rockhampton for
several years —one of those tortoise Tories with
but one theme, and that theme was Separation.
As soon as he once got going on Separation, the
House began to lose flesh, until the long, dreary
person was counted right out. In 1893 he and
Archer defeated Kidston and Larcombe; but in
1896 Kidston became the top and Curtis the
bottom member for Rockhampton, while Fiddes
was the man who was thrown out. In 1899 Curtis
was the top member and Kidston the bottom
member for Rockhampton, and Burns was the
miserable candidate who was thrown out. Then
Curtis ratted, and at the 1902 election Grant was
Rockhampton’s top member and Kidston its
bottom member, and Curtis was a sediment or
ruin. In his early days Kidston, like most Rock-
hamptonites, was an ardent Separationist; also
when the Commonwealth Referendum was taken,
Kidston fought against the movement. He didn’t
style himself an anti-Federalist, but an anti-
Billite. Clause 127 stuck in the throats of the
Separationists. Under that clause they thought
Separation would become absolutely impossible.
When the vote was taken, Rockhampton was the
only place in Central Queensland which gave a
large majority in favor of Federation. And right
there” the Separation movement came to a dead
stop and fell down in its tracks. But it will
assuredly rise again—not the same movement, for
the dead don’t come to life, but a better and more
•sensible one.
Of course, many of the sugar-cane farmers
pooh-pooh the State experimental stations, and
say they couldn’t afford to do things like that;
still it’s certain that much of what the stations do
to-day the farms will do to-morrow. For some
years past they have been making elaborate tests
with regard to irrigation and manuring. One
curious fact now fairly set on its legs is. that the
cane grown on non-irrigated and unfertilised land
gives the best quality sugar ; but the other land
gives the biggest crops. And the land seems to
want fertilising more than watering. In fact, in
the last experiments the crops that had no irriga-
tion and no manure gave four tons of sugar to the
acre, while the crops that had irrigation but no
manure only gave 3 tons 18 cwt. On the other
hand, the crops that had both irrigation and manure
gave 6 tons 6 cwt., and the ones that had manure
but no irrigation averaged 6 tons 2 cwt. Adding
the past year’s experiments to the older ones, it
looks as though a shipment of manure is worth a
heap more to a sugar district than a shipment of
the cheapest colored labor that ever was black-
bird ed.
“ Flinderino ” : The Cairns Shire Council,
which controls the narrow-gauge railway connect-
ing Cairns with the Mulgrave and Russell River
canefields, has recently re-named most of the
stopping places along the line. In the past the
stations have been called after the sugar cocky
whose humpy happened to be handiest, or after
some neighboring celebrity or butcher. One port,
of call rejoiced in the title of Chinaman’s Siding.
But in the re-christening aboriginal names have
been substituted in nearly every instance. Jones’s
Creek, Robinson’s, Brown’s Siding, etc., have
been kicked out of the service, and in their stead
one finds Waree, Meeba, Carree, Meringa, Yooi,
Yelka. Werrawa, Woonee, Derral, Yattee. A
few of the old names remain : Fishery Creek,
Figtree, Aloomba, Harvey Creek. It was in-
tended that the native names be translated
and the plain English meaning painted on the
station boards. But the idea was dropped when
it was found that the visiting tourist would be
confronted with such quaint information as
Stinking Dog Creek, Bull Frog Lagoon, Plenty
Empty Bingy, Dead Wallaby, etc.
NO OFFICIAL CRITERION.
LOCAL COP : “ Kin yez lend me an old shuit for a stranger phwat’s had his clothes shook whin bathin’? ”

■ The way-out Oaks goldfield— the last size-
able rush that Queensland had, and now turning
into a reefing field—is running a sort of Utopia
Unlimited. It started off by vetoing pubs and
other licensed drinkeries, and now it has vetoed
Costs. When there is a local disturbance each of
the parties nominates an arbitrator, and the dis-
trict P.M. nominates a referee. All witnesses
called receive a day’s pay. The tribunal’s-de-
cision and the evidence are both forwarded
to the P.M., who has up to the present en-
dorsed the work of the “Court.” There is no
appeal. Litigants save much expense this way,
because it is 80 miles to Georgetown, where the
nearest Court sits; and there isn’t a trace of
an agitation to get one to sit any nearer. What
will happen when some day somebody insists on
appealing hasn’t been discovered yet; but tbe
chances are that the wilful litigant will find that
the climate of the Oaks isn’t healthy.
One of the most wearisome complaints
against the Labor party is that its membersare “not
free men.” When one considers the matter side-
ways and endways, and perceives that the anti-
Laborite mostly uses his freedom to break his
pledges, the alleged slavery has its advantages. A
Laborite who was pledged to a policy of Australian
self-defence, and who joined with an advocate of the
cadging system of hired defence, would of course
be fired out. But wouldn’t he deserve it? A
Laborite, pledged to a white Australian policy,
"'ho helped to put into power a piebald Austra-
lian like Foxton, would also be fired out. And
wouldn’t he deserve it too? The men who are
under no pledge certainly have freedom
to vote for the very thing that the people sent
them to the House to vote against. If the people
think members are all the better for having that
liberty, well and good. But if they think that a
man should support in the House what he sup-
ported on the hustings, then they will throw up
the habit of heaving contemptuous language at
the Labor party’s pledge.
Old man Hanran, for many years Philp’s
speechless partner for Townsville, wired to his
constituents recently to say that he wouldn’t face
their interjections again. Already the fight for
the uninhabited hoofgear has begun. Ex-Speaker
Cowley, the ancient friend of the Kanaka, is
reaching out for the goods, and so are others.
Bananaland. still clings tenaciously, if not
lovingly, to its J.P. system ; and the average
elector, who says scornful things about the pro-
digious list, carefully scrutinises the next batch
with hope—his luck may change at any time.
Even in Brisbane the ignorant J.P. crowds the
minor court benches, much to the annoyance of
the paid and more or less trained magistrates.
Licensing cases in particular witness a wonderful
diligence on the part of the honorariums. It
is a scandal ; but there are so many of
these gentlemen with the tag nowadays that
a Parliamentarian with a seat to safeguard looks
hard the other way. Almost any man can get
into Parliament if all the J’s.P. of his electorate
vote for him, and hardly anybody can get in if all
the J’s.P. vote against him.
In the matter of living on borrowed
money, Southport and Townsville are the Awful
Examples in Queensland. Brisbane and South
Brisbane, of course, have a bigger debt per head ;
but they don’t count, because the people who
have business places in the city mostly live in the
suburbs. On the average, the shires owe 9s. lOd.
per head of their population; but Southport’s
little bundle is £7 13s. Id. And the worst of it is
that Southport, these days, is full of gloom and
decay and drifting sand and ownerless goats ; so
that last year its revenue was only £1983. Out of
that, interest and redemption scalloped £1139 ;
and after adding clerk’s salary and wear
and tear on the office mat, there wasn’t
much left to devote to the Awful Example’s roads
and culverts. Townsville is nearly as bad. It
owes £6 10s. lOd. per head. Last year loan
redemption and interest and office expenses
mopped up £11,255; and as Townsville’s total
receipts were only £21,772, there wasn’t much left
to do the tremendous lot of cleaning up and scour-
ing that the piebald city badly needs. Cooktown
has the next-worst record ; but that isn’t Cook-
town’s fault so much as its horrible luck.
“ M.A.” gives the scant history of a staff-
ride :
I was once captain’s orderly in a staff ride up north
and saw something .of the “innards” of the military
game as it is played in Australia. Our object was to
outflank a strong invading force. There were many pubs
and wine bodegas on our way and the staff found it
necessary to look them up for strategic purposes. My
boss, who, in private life, was secretary to a brewery,
took many orders for his firm during the ride, and some
of the junior officers, who were embryo farmers, selected
suitable blocks on which the yellow corn now waves.
First day out we lost the run of a major and two
lieutenants. The three gallant officers were partners in
a big butchering biz, and having heard of a mob of
“ fats” not far off, they fell out. Next day the adjutant
was also “ absent from roll call.” He had been noticed
sneaking round after a big German she-farmer only the
night before.
Our next bivouac was within two miles of the advance
guard of the brutal invader, and that night, whilst the
clerical staff was busy over maps and reports, the senior
captain rolled in drunk and kicked the colonel in the
stomach. He refused to give any reason for this, and
went to sleep whilst we were rendering first aid to
our respected chief. The “enemy” joined us at this
time and consumed much of our refreshments, but we at
last persuaded the hostile animal to go away.
During the night a grass fire swept down on us and
c lused our horses to pull away from the lines, and we
spent two days hunting for them in the scrub. The
sentry, a mate of mine, fought the sergeant-major to a
finish over this. The latter told Jim that he was drunk
whilst on duty, and Jim admitted he was, adding “ Wot
then ? ” The sergeant-major mentioned something about
a court-martial, and Jim said—— No, he didn’t say any-
thing ; he simply landed his officer one on the jaw, and
that started the trouble. Jim outed his superior
in the tenth round, anpl then offered to take the colonel
on ; but the colonel'? stomach was Still lame.
However, those we^e'merely episodes. We got back
at the end of 15 da/sj/f,,having accomplished—so the
papers said —“a most 1 useful and arduous piece of work,
covering an area of 6Vek(30 l mile«s>;f
The Last Cigar.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I AM off again on the lonely track,
And my last cigar is burning,
For the voice has called from the far Out
back,
And there will be no returning.
The city has held me all too long,
For it knows we are parting for ever ;
But my heart is light and my step is strong
As I turn to the Never-Never.
Oh, call again ! for I come apace,
And my heart gives answer gladly ;
For here in the hustle I have no place,
And I pant for my freedom madly.
I shake this dirt from my threadbare tweed.
And make for the dust out yonder,
With the hungry gasp of a jaded steed
Set free, at its will to wander.
I flick the ash from the rich cigar
As I flick this soot from my clothing ;
And I lift my face to the ways afar,
As I turn from the town with loathing.
And as to the Northern ways I turn,
With never a thought of returning.
My last repinings to ashes burn
As my last cigar is burning.
WAIF.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 14, 1909.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The Dudley Countess has been giving local folk
a treat with her jewels. At the big Jubilee ball,
which danced away the hours of Thursday even-
ing, she appeared in a robe of virginal white,
hung with diamonds. Her coronet was
one vast lustre, while chains of precious stones
draped her very tight bodice. As she ascended the
stairway, divesting herself of her wraps as she
went, there was one gigantic “ Ah-h-h ! ” from
the assembled that nearly lifted the roof and
blew it on to the transcontinental railway. The
room was a bower of palms. The vice-regal set
was a maze of inaccuracy that all Dicky Nevill s
tact failed to untangle ; and the general arrange-
ments were such as ought to earn a halo for
Major Hubert Harris and his girl-and-boy com-
mittee. The proceeds go to the general hospital,
and the National Ass. Council hadn’t the decency
to be present.
Marie Narelle is with us. She has arrived back
from the wilds of the North, looking remarkably
fit after the illness which recently laid her low.
Nevertheless it is a much-diminished Marie that
has paused to be fed at the O’Shea mansion.
Another guest at that hospitable board is pretty
Florrie Gleeson, who leaves this coming week to
join “The Flag Lieutenant” co. by Yarra’s banks.
By way of some more music, Mrs. Melba, with
temper still on edge, lately went to Toowoomba,
where she warbled with a good or bad grace on
Thursday. Despite the cold which wrecked some
of her northern river dates, the incomparable top
note is still going strong.
Government House opened its doors to a select
600 or so on Monday afternoon, and the weather
behaved like a beast. A wet trickle, not wet
enough to send the multitude indoors (where they
couldn’t have got in any case), spoiled satin trains
and ostrich tips in a heartless fashion. Some
very elevated frocks were on view, and the cater-
ing was the best thing done here for years.
One of your Sydney visitors, who is mayoress of
somewhere, nearly died of joy when the Dicky
lord remembered the municipal fact, and an-
nounced her in all her dignity. It was not this
samelady, by the way, who signed herself “ Jane”
after “Alexandra” of England.
On Wednesday, Government House arose en
masse— that is the two Mrs. Hore-Ruthvens,
Melba and all the aides —and helped to open the
Jubilee show, which is very like any other show,
only more so. Her Ex. bore the heat with an im-
passive face; likewise the long dull lunch and the
hour in the grandstand afterwards. She is either a
marvel of self-sacrifice or a monument of hidden
joy. At a late annual gathering she described
herself as a happy wife and mother, and I confess
to a burning desire to see her look it, if only for a
moment. She appears more like a frozen relative.
Florette Murray-Prior of the contralto voice
has returned to us. The contralto is said to have
improved while its owner was away. Talking of
the Murray-Prior clan, sister Ethel was quietly
and unobtrusively wedded to her Butler (1 mean
the Laird of Kilcoy) on Wednesday at noon. The
very small wedding party crept away from the
show, and the Archbishop tied the knot at
2 o’clock.
Touching the matter of Jubilee shows, 49,000
people viewed ours on Wednesday. But what
we really need is not another show, but another
council; or at least we want part of our council
replaced by something new. The wild officious-
ness of one member of the present body gets on
our nerves.
One day last week, Horne Secretary Appel took
the lingering remains of the Southern women-
conferencers to Dunwich, which is our House of
Living Death. Dunwich is not a place that makes
one hilarious, and the poor old folk, separated
from their life-partners, are sad enough to suit
the most morbid spectator. But the sight of
Geo. Appel trudging his way over the island with
a she-following about 63 strong was worth going
far to see. Solomon in all his glory hadn’t a more
varied train.
Arthur Morgan plays a very secondary fiddle
while the Dudley star is in the firmament. His
good lady, however, is doing a round of fancy
fairs and such-like. She sat next to the Chief
Justice at the official show lunch, and seemed like
to die of boredom. Admiral Poore, whose big
grey ship lies out in the bay indulging in big gun
practice, made a speech and put in a word for
Jack of the R.N. reserve. “If you want to help
the Empire.” said he “begin by seeing that the
naval boys in your employ get their time off for
training.”
On Wednesday the exclusive assembliers made
their exhibition effort. Decoratively speaking, it
was 'a successful hop. Daffodils, all a-blowing,
formed a dado round the room, while festoons of
sparkly stuff, falling from ceiling, galleries and
dado aforesaid, suggested a garden in the rain.
It was a night out for wedded couples, the
smartest frockers being Mrs. H. D. Cohen, Mrs.
J. Clark, the Burt lady, and Miss Dora Jopp.
Also there was a lady present who seemed to have
taken off everything in reason.
A show ring sensation was provided on Wednes-
day, when Mrs. Ryan’s neddy rejected her on
the off side, and careered round the ring, bumping
her head cheerfully on this hard world. When
she got free from the entangling stirrup she re-
ceived a kick that ought to have fitted on her
halo ; but she simply went home per ambulance,
and turned up bright and smiling next day for her
blue ribbon.
Beatrice Day pleases Brisbaneites. They flock
to see her, and not all the art of J ulius Superbus
could fetch the houses that this large lady has
been drawing. Julius is an attraction, but Day
without Knight would do a lot bigger business
than Knight without Day.
Wonderful are the ways of Providence, as shown
by the following par, which appeared in a certain
daily recently. And, oh ! I should admire to
meet the gentleman who is “to lecture upon the
above subject” :
A Sad Case.
In the Police Court to-day two infant female children,
16 years old, were committed to the Orphanage for
7 years (our Townsville correspondent wired yesterday).
This was a peculiarly sad case. The mother, who was a girl
of 17 years, was admitted to the hospital on July 4, and
died on the 6th, after the children had been born. She
declined to state who was the father of the children,
though she stated that her mother knew. A constable
stated that the latter declined to give any information, or
support the infants.
A lecture is to be delivered on the above subject on
Friday evening by Mr. Win. Harbutt, A.R.C.A., at the
rooms of the Royal Geographical Society, Public Library
Building, William-street.
Yours sincerely,
MARIO.


THE MOUNT AS AN INSTITUTION.
Mount Morgan has one interesting side, in that it
is a self-contained institution—a mechanical
kingdom, and a law unto itself in many
respects.
I his kingdom has many colonies and distant
dependencies —
Its directorates are in London, Sydney and
Rockhampton.
Its refining works are at Port Kcmbla,
N.S. W.
Its limestone quarries, for fluxing material,
are at Marmor, on the Gladstone line.
Its ironstone treatment materials arc being
delved from the side of a pine-clad island
laved by Pacific waters on the Queensland
coast.
It has a colony at Many Peaks.
It Iras its workshops, mills, factories , machine-
shops, and a central administration
bureau; and above all
IT HAS A SPLENDIDLY PRACTICAL
SYSTEM OF TECHNICAL INSTRUC-
TION IN THE TOWN OF MOUNT
MORGAN.

THE LURE OE GOLD.—IV.
THE MOUNT REVISITED.
BY J. D. FITZGERALD, Barrister-at-Law.
The point of view which I desire to emphasise in
this article is, that apart from its aspect as a great
mine, Mount Morgan is a self-contained institu-
tion. Self-contained in this sense, that it com-
prises a number of subsidiary industries grouped
about it at the foot of the hill, industries which
furnish maintenance for a large number of men,
and which offer opportunities of steady employ-
ment to a large population. The benefits’of these
subsidiary industries are many. The wages earned
by the men in turn furnish employment for others,
so that the benefits of the mine spread in con-
centric circles. The purchasing power of the men
employed in this small State within a State enables
them in their turn to employ the storekeeper,
and the tradesman, the farmer, and the profes-
sional man, and also to furnish their quota
towards the upkeep of the services of the
great State of Queensland. This I submit as an
REPRESENTATIVE QUEENSLANDERS

aspect of the mine which is deserving of special
consideration. It has one further feature—an im-
portant one—the mine, with its subsidiary indus-
tries, has a training school for the young citizens.
As the young generation grows up it has
an opportunity of passing through the work-
shops and learning the trades in the Tech-
n!cal School, which is one of the features
of the town of Mount Morgan that must
ne admired by all practical men. In order to
freshen my impressions of the Mount, and to
measure the progress which had been made in the
interval of 19 years since mv last visit. I went
again in June last. The fascination of the mine
still made a strong appeal to me, and I felt this
as I saw, from the house of a friend on
the Upper Dawson-road, Rockhampton, the huge
columns of smoke ascending from the distant
ranges in a slate-lined pillar, against the blue-grey
sky of a cold winter’s day. Viewed from that
distance the Golden Mount looked like a smok-
ing volcano—Vesuvius or Etna. I arrived at
night. It was raining, and the haze of the light
Queensland rain gave a ghostly effect to the blue
electric lights on the hillside. Viewed from the
verandah of the hotel, the mine still gave me the
impression of an active volcano. From time to
time the slag was run down in trucks to the crest
of a precipice and emptied over. As the molten
slag ran down, lighting up the whole hillside with
its glow, one could easily imagine, in that mistv
atmosphere, that a river of gold was pouring out
of the mountain side, and spilling itself in cas-
cades over the edge.
Ahe head <>f this great mining kingdom is Cap-
tain Richards. I understand that the title
‘captain ’ is not a military one. It is given
affectionately, and it denotes in the best sense of
the word that the man occupying this responsible
position is a Captain of Industry. Everything
that can conduce to the productivity of the mine
plus the welfare of those employed in the mine, is
attended to by the head of the mine. He is the
actual working head of the mine operations. Of
course, there are directors. Possibly, Mount
.Morgan is as well off for directors as any other in-
stitution m the world. There is a Rockhampton, a
Sydney, and a Londori directorate. The directorate,
however, is a benevolentinstitution wherever it is
located. There is a very little fluctuation in
the value of Mount Morgan shares. The actual
value of the mine is too well known to lend it-
self to gambling and speculation. There are a
few very large shareholders, some of whom were
m the mine from the first; and these men are
tosee toifc that the mine is regarded
with different eyes from some others which are

known in Australian mining history and in the
mining history of other countries. They are
strong enough to steady the share market at any
moment. The mine is an industrial institution,
as much so as a woollen mill—more so than a
woollen mill, because the supply of raw material
for a woollen mill might be the subject of fluctua-
tions according to favorable or unfavorable
seasons ; but the supply of the raw material for the
smelters and the cyaniding vats, and the other
processes of the Mount is of a known and proved
quantity. It is well understood that, even at the
present time, there is proved by actual tests with
the diamond drill and by probings of the great
hill to its core, to be sufficient material for 20 years.
Approaching the mountain the visitor becomes
aware of the tremendous
forces at work in connec-
tion with the mine,
forces supplied by men,
by horses, by machin-
ery, huge turbines
throbbing and thud-
ding at the foot of the
hill, to supply light and
power for the process of
the mine. This splendid
auxiliary service forces
air down into the si afcs
and tunnels and galler-
ies, in order that the
men may, ant-like, bur-
row and eat their way
into and worm out all
the secrets of the hill.
On the left and below
the hill are tailings
heaps, the relics of the
first crude process for
winning the gold. Just
above them is the first
level ; and here the
administrative br a i n-
centre of the mine is
situated. Here the
Captain has his office,
here the commercial
methods are applied,
for, so far as the
directorate is concerned, the mine is treated
in the same business-like fashion as Anthony
Horderns’, Mark Foy’s, Finney Isles’, or
Whiteley’s. On the left of the plateau is
the gold house, where, after the final process,
the gold is brought, weighed with machinery
of the most delicate balance, and locked in
the strong room with all the precautions
that would be employed in the Bank of England
vaults. On the right is the fitting shop and
engineering department. On the left is the
timber shop, where the scream of the circular saw,
cutting through huge iron bark or spotted gum,
hardly ever ceases. Further to the right at
the foothill is the engine house, with the tur-
bines generating light for the mine, and forc-
ing air through the hill. Away towards the
railway station is the brickworks, another'
subsidiary industry in connection with the
mine. Here all kinds of fire bricks are
manufactured—bricks for houses and bricks for
factory use in connection with the fittings and
machinery of the mine. In the turbine house I
was introduced to the man in charge. He was a
young man, an enthusiast, and an Australian.
He was a fine product of one phase of the admir-
able system employed in Mount Morgan. He was
promoted from an inferior position to the one he
now holds upon the death of bis former chief.
It is the policy of the Captain to give the highest
opportunities to all who are employed in the mine,
in order that the true democratic idea may be
allowed full play, namely, that the work should
go to the one most capable of doing it, and that
every opportunity should be offered to the
ambitious boy or youth to enable him to perfect
himself in the trade which he has chosen, and
thus become useful to the mine in whatever
capacity he is employed.
In the sawmills are prepared the huge logs
which constitute the square sets for the support
of the tunnels, as the mining operations under-
ground are carried on. Reference to the pictures
which accompany this article will show.that what
is now called “ the open cut” was honeycombed
by the miners of the past, who filled the stopes
with these solid beams of timber. Later on, when
larger schemes were undertaken, the tunnelling
and honeycombing of the hill became an obsolete
mode of doing work. With Titanic energy the
directorate of the mine undertook to scrape away
the whole of the hill itself, and to pass it through
their processes in the search for gold. The pic-
tures show how the hill was honeycombed.
They show the wooden galleries from which
the ores were stripped. Then the hill was
scraped away, and the timber piled in heaps. To-
day you stand in the open cut as in the crater of a
volcano. There are light rail way lines running in
every direction. In one ravine a huge steam
shovel is scraping away a crag, and depositing
the spoil in trucks to be run through to the treat-
ment places. You heSr the whirring sound of
the compressed air drills, away above on the dizzy
heights, the power for which is conveyed from the
engines away down below. Bearded men are
working the drills. Soon the heights at which they
work will be reduced to valleys; and the
material, after passing through the chemical treat-
ment processes, after having the gold and copper
extracted from it, will run away in almost im-
palpable sand into the creek below, where the
stili confident fossicker remains to this day,
extant, with his primitive dish and shovel, lying
in wait outside the legal boundaries of the mine
to catch the stray gold which may escape from the
meshes which the company has prepared for it.
We get some idea of perpetual motion in
this mine. The machinery never stops ; it could
not stop. The air, which is the very life blood of
the operations, has to be forced through all the
network of passages away below the ground off
shoots of the vertical shaft which one comes to
after walking through the long tunnel. There
are inclined shafts down which you look away to
illimitable distances ; the electric, lights, mellow-
ing away in the depths, show strange colors, like
those of the jewelled fruits in the subterranean
garden of the Arabian Nights’ stories.
ORE CRUSHING PREPARATORY TO CYANTDTNG.
The men employed in all departments are fine,
well-set-up, jolly-looking fellows. They have good
pay, good hours, considerate treatment, and, con-
tinuity of employment. The grimy conditions of
the ordinary mining town, as one sees it in
Britain, do not exist. The men in smart clothes
go to their work. In a building established on
the hillside they change their smart clothes and
assume working garments before going to the
mine. Returning from the mine, they take off
their muddy clothes, indulge in a bath of hot or
cold water, take their ordinary clothes from the
locker in which they placed them, dress, and go
home clean and comfortable to their families.
This is a feature connected with the mining laws
of Queensland, and it is one which might be
carried into the process of many industrial enter-
prises in other parts of Australia.
The great mine has many suburbs. London is
one, and others are nearer. For example, Iron
Island, off the coast of Queensland, provides flux-
ing material, which is used in the gold and copper
fluxes. The pictures herewith show the type of
scenery and vegetation upon and around this
island, which is one of the typical islands of the
Queensland coast. Then, again, the electrolytic
treatment establishment of Port Kernbla, in N. S.
Wales, is a suburb of Mount Morgan, where the
crude copper obtained from the smelting works at
Mount Morgan is subjected to the final process,
before it passes into commercial use, to furnish
material for the huge network of modern indus-
trial, enterprises dependent upon machinery.
Many of the leading men in the Port Kernbla
establishment have graduated from the Mount
Morgan workshops and branches. On the line
between Rockhampton and Gladstone is the
village of Marmor, where huge quantities of lime-
stone, used in fluxing, are obtained in the com-
pany’s own quarries. A seam of fireclay runs
through the hills surrounding the mount. Again
at Many Peaks, there are fluxing materials rich in
copper.
While on a visit to Japan, in 1903, I had an
opportunity of seeing the Mitsu Bishi dock, and
engineering works, ship yards, etc., in Nagasaki.
The system there struck me as being most practi-
cal. The children in the neighboring schools are
educated with a view to employment in all the
various branches of the work carried on in the
Mitsu Bishi dock, and their special tastes noted
and encouraged. After engaging in the school
tasks of the day, which are of a technical nature,
directed towards the theoretical part of the work
of the great dock, and the shipbuilding works,
the students are taken by their teachers through
the workshops. I saw hundreds of boys with
eager faces, pouring out of the schools, dressed in
European clothes, with caps on their heads, and
flocking into the various branches of the works.
I found a system very similar to this in opera-
tion at Mount Morgan. The company, the towns-
folk, and the Government have combined for the
purpose of building a technical college. It is one
of the most complete institutions of its kind that

I have ever seen, and it is a true product of the
Mount. The bricks of which it was built were
made in the factory of the company. The designs
of the rooms, furniture and appointments were
made by the officers of the company, and its cur-
riculum is planned with a view to the future
employment of the students in the practical work
of the great mountain. It would be hard to devise
a finer system than that in use in this college.
Every piece of furniture bears the impress of
careful selection and even of bold experiment
from the lecturer’s demonstration desk, which,
folding back, shows a stove for the cooking
classes, to the special tables for the dressmaking
and millinery (domestic economy classes).
The idea is most practical. Thus we have
grouped such subjects as freehand, model, per-
spective. geometrical and light and shade drawing,
working forward to machine construction-drawing
and design. The young engineer can thus acquire
the art of designing the work, placing his design
on paper, and seeing it worked out in the work-
shop.- The young mechanic thus is taught to
mould his ideas from the mind picture to the sub-
stantial thing itself. Then there are commercial
methods—bookkeeping, shorthand and typing,
commercial arithmetic. Theory and practice go
hand in this scheme. Mechanics, surveying,
engine-driving, mensuration, etc., are taught
side bv side with dressmaking, millinery, cookery,
domestic economy, starching and ironing. Then
there is a department of chemistry and physics
on the one hand, and on the other, mechanical
engineering, carpentry and joinery, and general
and sanitary plumbing. The president of this
institution, Mr. Norman White, is one of the
engineers of the mine, and he sees to it that the
proper balance between theory and practice is
maintained. In fact, here we find worked out,
without any plagiarism, the scheme which the
Japanese have adopted in the Mitsu Bishi Dock,
and which they’ probably borrowed from the
great Fairfield Building Yards on the Clyde, or
from the Tyneside works.
No one recognises more than the writer the
inadequacy of this rapid esquisse of the great
Mount. I have brushed my impressions broadly
on the canvas, and have not labored the details.
The Mount has not had an official historian since
Mr. Frank Sykes’s “authentic treatise,” pub-
lished in 1892, lent me by Mr. Holyoake Woodd,
the company’s secretary. Surely the time has
arrived when the magnificent system evolved in
connection with the mine should be written up
and given to the world, in order that the extra-
ordinary nature of the discovery itself, and the
splendid means of exploitation of the mineral
wealth, shall be known far and wide, as a
sample of the resources of Queensland and the
enterprise of Queenslanders. Such a book, if
distributed abroad, would be one of the finest
advertisements Australia has yet had.


Skin Came Off from Finger Ends to
Elbows—Treated for Months by
Skin Specialists Who Could Do
Nothing for this Distressing Case,
FOUND PERFECT CURE
AT LAST IN CUTICURA
“I had blood poison in both my
hands. My doctor got the blood poison
4
m
out all right but, with
the treatment he gave
me, all the skin came off
my hands from my
finger ends up to my
elbows. They were as
raw as beef. I was un-
able to do any work for
about twelve months
owing to this accident.
The doctor kept me
under his care all these
months. He tried every-
thing in his power and
it was not much better
in the end. So at last he told me he
could do no more for me and I felt very
down-hearted as I thought I was not
going to get better. The doctor advised
me to go to a skin specialist, and so I
did. When he looked at my hands
he said it was a very bad case.
“I was under his care for a few
months, but I was no better with all
his treatment. I gave it up for a
bad job, and I told my doctor I was
getting no better. He recommended
me to .the Infirmary to try
another skin specialist. I tried his
treatment for three months but found
no benefit from it at all. Six years ago
I thought I was not going to get a cure.
One day I saw the Cuticura Remedies
advertised and said I should like to givo
them a trial. I sent for Cuticura Soap
and Cuticura Ointment. After I tried
them and saw that my hands wero
coming on first class I persevered till I
got a cure. Now my hands are all right
and I am at my usual work. I am
never without Cuticura Soap and Oint-
ment and shall praise them wherever I

Of the reserves £13,682 is described as “accumulated
profits invested in the assets of the co., renewals of works,
contingent fund, and wear and tear account.” If this
means that part of the fund is in renewals, then to that
extent it isn’t a reserve at all; also the “ profits ” which
were used to make the replacements were not profits at
all. A co. buys a machine with capital; then, when that
machine is worn out, either the capital it cost ought to
be written off as lost or used up, or there ought to be
enough accumulated revenue in hand to buy another
machine. But the accumulated revenue required to re-
place the worn-out machine isn’t any more profit than
the wages which have been paid to the workmen ; for the
value knocked off a machine, or a gas-main, or anything
else is as much part of the cost of production as wages are.
This co. ought to abolish this conglomerated item, and
show the real reserves separately. In other respects the
accounts are very well presented. Liquid assets on
June 30 were £5884 ; liabilities £919. For years past the
co. has been almost stationary ; it has paid 12 per cent,
since 1896, and before that it paid more. The trifle extra
profit for the past half-year seems to have come from
larger sales than usual of coke and by-products, and
doesn’t, therefore, mean anything; so the margin above
the div. is perilously narrow.

This co.’s profits climb up and slither down according
chiefly to the vagaries of the lead market. In boom times
the directors write off something solid to cover wear and
tear; at other times they do nothing but pay for
repairs. In the past year nothing has been written
off anything except meters. On plant and construc-
tion account £30,699 has been spent from first to
last, and these assets still stand in the books at
£24,360 ; and it is very doubtful whether the other £6339
covers all the wear and tear and decay, especially as
Broken Hill is 22 years nearer its end than it was when
the co. was formed, and 22 years isa long stretch in the life
of a silver-lead field, worked with the rapidity of modern
mining. Of its capital of £28,229 this co. has £7979 of
liquid assets in excess of liabilities —a fair position, yet
no better than it ought to be considering that the Broken
Hill mines can’t last for ever, and Broken Hill won’t want
any gas after the mines are done. Assume that they will
last 21 years more. If, then, the present £7979 were
accumulated for 10 years more, the co. could repay
£lO,OOO of capital and have £BOO or so to go on with ; and
to be in a position to pay back the other £18,229 of
capital in 21 years, only a shade under £6OO of profits
must be set aside year by year and accumulated at 4 per
cent. In a doomed place like Broken Hill that sinking fund
ought to be kept quite independent of the business. And
th'e £6OO, plus the interest on the present £7979, must,
further, be independent of anything put aside to pro-
vide for replacements. After 10 years there would, of
course, be £lO,OOO less capital to pay dividends on ; and
that would be a great help in keeping renewals going,
or in providing for municipal competition. Looked
at this way the so-called profits of the past few
years are not so fine as they seem on the surface, and the
directors have been very' wise to keep the div. down to
6 percent.

This co. didn’t set aside enough profits to cover deprecia-
tion, and therefore found itself later on with a worn-out
plant and nothing to buy another one with. In other
words,- it had been using up its capital, without troubling
to replace it out of revenue. Instead, however, of
writing off the capital which had been improperly
regarded as profit and paid away in dividends, the co. cut
down its ordinary 7 div. ; but this half-year it puts it up
again to 3J per cent., notwithstanding that there is stili
a large deficiency. The electric light business has
improved; yet on over £7OOO at which that branch
still stands in the books, the revenue for the
six months was only £154 ahead of the expenditure ; and
depreciation has to come out of that. The recent un-
divided profit has been used to pay off debt: —

But it is quite possible that the alleged profits and
reserves are not true profits and reserves. New
premises were provided in 1904, and though a
fruit-market building would suffer heavy depreciation,
the property item has stood ever since at the same
amount —£29,680. Repairs have been done ; but there
must be some depreciation beyond that. The financial
position has got better :
1905. 1909.
Debentures and other debt .. £15,182 £12,131
Liquid assets 9 1,181
Excess of liabilities .. £15,173 £10,950
So things have improved to the extent of £4223 in four
years. But more or less of that is no doubt needed to
counterbalance depreciation of premises. And there is
another thing which ought to be provided for out of
profits—the risk of municipal markets rendering these
markets unprofitable, and thus destroying some of their
capital value. On the whole, then, though the co.’s
record looks very fine in the table printed above, it is very
likely somewhat less fine than it looks.

Buttonholed in London after his return from
West Africa, W. J. Loring, of 8., M. and Co., said that,
given good management, there was no reason why the
Gold Coast should not push its way to the front as a gold
producer. He, however, saw great waste out there, and
guessed that, by the look of it, some of the machinery
had been shot out of a gun. Loring is dead against low
salaries for either officials or men, and reckons that to get
the right class attractive salaries and wages will have to
be offered.

in the battle Of life. Life’s battle is a hard one, and you must have steady nerve, a clear brain, and muscles like
bands of steel. Ihe weak man or woman must give way to the strong, the robust and the vigorous. Your health and
physical vitality should be guarded as the miser guards his gold. Dr. McLaughlin, the electrical authoritv, has discov-

ered the true method of applying Electricity for the perfect cure of the ills and ailments
of mankind. Electricity is Natu e’s Remedy. There is not a weak person in
this whole world to-day who cannot become strong, healthy and vigorous again if they
will only apply the right current of Electricity. We have a method of applying Electricity
for the cure of the various weaknesses of men and women which will cure in every case.
Our method of applying Electricity is fast supplanting the use of drugs all over the world.
DRUGS ARE USELESS!
Drugs cannot and will not cure the Nervous Ailments and Weaknesses of Men and
Women, such as Loss of Vigor and Vitality, Rheumatism, Kid-
ney, Liver and Bladder Troubles, Constipation, Stomach
Disorders, etc., etc. Nature never intended a man’s stomach to be the
receptacle for strong drugs, and if you persist in their use it will not be long until
you will be beyond curing ; your stomach will be totally destroyed. Electricity,
when applied by Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt, gives to every part
of the body—as it travels over the nerves—strength and vitality, and quickly
drives out disease, no matter where it is located. When you are weak there is
simply a lack of Electricity in the system—not enough electricity to keep up your
nerve force—and before you can again be restored to vitality and vigor electricity
must be supplied. Weakness defeats the aim or ambition of man. The weak
man must be made strong before he has the necessary energy and brain power to
succeed. Electricity builds up the shattered nervous system, restores strength and
vitality, makes rich, red blood ; it is the bulwark against which disease must fall. It brings
tHe sunbeams of happiness and health into a life which has been darkened by weakness. We have thousands of
testimonials to prove all our assertions. Our belt is simple, easy to use and is guaranteed to give a strong current.
It has special attachments fop men and women. They are within the reach of all; price £1 and up.
Beware of cheap imitations.

NOTE.—The said JOSEPH KEYNES left Poole in the
County of Dorset in or about the year 1857 when 16 years
of age with his brother TOM KEYNES for the Cod
Fisheries at St. Johns Newfoundland.
The said TOM KEYNES left England when 14 years of
age with his brother JOSEPH in the year 1857 for New-
foundland. It is believed by members of the family that
this TOM KEYNES left Newfoundland for Australia that
he resided for a time in that Colony and returned to
England about 14 years ago and was seen at that time in
Poole (Dorset) by one of his brothers.
The said WILLTAM KEYNES was last heard of about
20 years ago at which time he was living at Aldershot in
the County of Surrey England and had a son who if living
at the present time would be about 36. years of age.
The said Testator JAMES BARNES died on the 20th
February 1901.

Fred Flower, M.L.C., Labor member, tried
vainly to include in the Nurses’ Registration Bill,
now before N.S.W. Parliament, a clause regu-
lating hours of toil. Something ought to be done
in that matter, and the Labor party is the only
one which looks humane enough to do it. There
are several removable evils in a hospital nurse’s
life, but the most important of them is plain over-
work. Day nurses come on duty at 6'30 a.m.,
and they go off at 9 p.m.; except on the Day of
Rest, when they go off at 9'30 p.m. That means
14ij hours per day for six days in the week, and 15
on Sunday—or 102 hours in the seven days. From
this disgraceful total must be deducted three half-
hours a day for three meals, it having presumably
been found cheaper to feed the young women in
a dining-room than to allow them to gnaw a bone
while looking after patients. In some cases also—
only in some cases—a half-hour is allowed every
day for toilet purposes. That makes two hours
off the daily graft, leaving the nurse only
hours to work on week-days and 13 hours on Sun-
day all the year round. Eighty-eight hours in the
week, in a druggy atmosphere, and with respon-
sible duties to perform! “But, then,” say the
authorities, “every nurse has an average of two
hours’ leave on pass every day, and she may go
out and breathe the fresh air and see her friends
and do her shopping and improve her mind, and
all that sort of thing.” So she may—in theory.
She gets seven “passes” a week; and, with a
knowledge of that fact, the astonishing quidnuncs
who, for some inscrutable reason, are permitted to
run our hospitals, lie back on their chairs and
pat their rotundities and regard themselves as
humane as well as able administrators. They
forget—perhaps they don’t know—that of these
seven passes two are employed in attendance on
lectures, two more in preparation of notes on these
lectures, and a fifth in attendance on some prac-
tical demonstration in one or other branch of
training. Night nurses are treated even more
villainously. They go on duty at 9 p.m., and they
come off at 7 a.m.—one of them to each ward.
Ten hours in the biting cold of winter, as
in the brutal heat of summer! As a rule,
they can get to bed by 9.30 a.rn.s and they
are allowed to stay there for seven hours—
unless, of course (which happens always),
they have to attend and prepare for lectures and
demonstrations of various kinds. Each night
nurse, then, has to work a minimum of 10 hours in
actual attendance on the patients in her huge
ward, without taking into account the time she
has to spare out of her sleeping hours in the
matter of lectures. How should .we attempt to
remedy this shocking state of affairs? How
ensure an eight-hours day for nurses ? The thing
is done in some of the American States; why
should it not be done in Australia? Obviously,
the best way would be to nationalise the hospitals.
The State is a big subscriber to the maintenance
of hospitals, but it has a very small savin their
management. It should be the supreme authority
—in fact, the sole authority—and then it could
give the nurses the same decent hours which are
worked by its other servants, the engine-drivers.
There is no other visible remedy. It is up to the
Labor party to take up this matter in all the
States (not that the Labor party hasn’t its hands
full enough already, for it is the general refuge
of the oppressed; yet' the oppressed too
often forget to. vote for it when the trien-
nial Day of Judgment arrives). In all the
States the sweating of hospital nurses prevails.
The “ upper classes,” who generally manage these
institutions, have no sympathy with the eight
hours system. They won’t help. Now and again
a gorgeous personage from the extreme topmost
ridge of society descends and says something
pathetic and beautiful about Florence Nightin-
gales and “ministering angels.” And there it
ends. “Ministering angels,” forsooth! Nurses
aren’t ministering angels at all ; they are very
human. They don’t mind “ministering”—they
like it; but they object, to slaving. And, above
all, they don’t want to he “angels yet.
♦
From time immemorial the “ thrifty ”
Victorian farmer and land-grabber had the use of
closed roads and water frontages for nothing ; but
in 1903 an Act was passed making a charge for the
rights to them. What the State was losing, and
what the land-grabber was quietly sneaking, has
only now been realised. Since the Apt was
enforced the State has collected £69.555 for these
rights, of which, sum £58,218 has been for the use
of closed roads. In the first three years the rents
totalled only £25,942; in 1907 they came to
£17,786; last year they were £25 827, and it is
alleged that only about half of the . free-graziers
have yet been rounded up.
One of this country’s too numerous im-
ported vice-regal personages was amazed, on
coming to Australia, to find that the gardener
employed at the gubernatorial establishment was
in receipt of 365. a week and keep. This, said
the fainting potentate, was a thing unheard of in
England, and he gave orders to dock 6s. from
Adam’s hire, whereupon Adam simply skied his
job and left. That Excellency is still looking for
a cheap, submissive cultivator, and meanwhile Sin
Fat gives the viceroy this day his daily vegetable.

“N.” : The London Times, just to hand,
has an extraordinary column on the famous blue
gem known as the Hope diamond, with its start-
ling run of ill-luck. It was sold a few weeks ago
in Paris for £lO,OOO, though dealers admit it is
worth £16,000. There were good reasons for the
depreciation. This diamond, like the Kohinoor,
was only part of a much larger one. One
Tavernier brought it to Prance, with 27 others.
He looked pretty well financed, but was knocked
out because of an outrageous son, who dissipated
his property. He sold the diamond to Louis XIV.,
and Louis passed it to Madame de Montespan,
whose power, then began to wane. It was
also once in the hands of the great
and rich Pouquet. He was soon ruined.
During the period of Louis XV.—the Well-
Beloved—there is a gap in the narrative of the
gem. Marie Antoinette fished it out and sported
it. We know how she fell. She once lent it to
the Princess de Lamballe, who was killed by the
mob, and lay about naked after death. Another
spell of 40 years intervenes. Then the article was
sent to Pais, an Amsterdam cutter. It was stolen
by his son. The son suicided, and Fals was
ruined. Prom Pals, jun., it had passed to a
certain Eliason, a London man, who was afraid to
truckle with such a well-known article. It is
alleged that he died of starvation with it
in his possession. Next it was heard of as
being in the possession of the Hope family, de-
scendants of the rich author of “ Anastasius.”
History is negligent of detail until Lord F. Hope
got the diamond. This is the person who married
May Yohe, and apparently she had an oppor-
tunity of wearing the fatal gaud a few years after
her appearance as a variety artist in the little
Queen’s Hall (formerly Charley Wright’s Colos-
seum) in Bourke-street, Melbourne. Hope told a
flattering tale, but the blue stone was not
lucky to him. After divorcing his wife
the jewel. It was bought by one
v\ eu of London. He only held such hot
lon ? enou gh to pass it on to Frankel,
of New York. This man was ruined through
finding the malign stone unsaleable. Later the
diamond was bought by one Colot, and sold by
him to Prince Kanitvoski, a Russian. The Prince
loaned it to Mdlle. Ladue, of the Folies Bergeres
iheatre. The first (and apparently last) time she
wore it was on the stage. That night the Prince
shot her from a side-box. Afterwards he was
stabbed by a revolutionist. The diamond was
next traced to Martharides, a Greek, who fell over
a precipice. The question arises: “ Did he fall,
or Was he pushed ? ” After that it was beard of in
Constantinople. The allegation is made that the
ex-Sultan gave it to his favorite Sultana, and shot
her when the Young Turks invaded the palace.

My Camp Fires.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
BY red asbestos dummy, or radiator bright;
As flit across the curtains faint shadows
of the night;
A city s comfort round you, all service at your
need—
This Ballad of my Camp Fires may happen you
will read.
You bide not more contented nor healthily than I,
Whose house is walled by mountains and covered
by the sky.
No rare Habana glowing more joy can bring your
soul
Than this old vet’ran briar fresh lighted by a coal.
My camp fire, like a censer, a perfumed breath
outpours,
Of aromatic incense ; and as my heart adores
At Nature’s quiet altars, o’erlit by star-lamps
clear,
I dream of camp fires lighted through bush lands
far and near.
The Bushland, oh the Bushland ! How joyous
and how sweet
Her lovers find the pathways unto their rovin°-
feet !
And aye, Australian forests, and aye the Austral
oea
lil be f l * m ° Ur ' learfcs * n bondage who pine not to
Nea,th darkened she-oaks mourning, where watch-
ful plovers call,
And bastioned mountains downward in deep
moon-shadows fall ;
Where, like a silver ribbon upon a green silk
gown, • °
Wollondilly her valley wanders
Where spring the Cox and Cowmung from hill-
sides white with snow,
They burned in hours of wonder-my fires of
long ago.
And ]aid theU ' r ° Sy altars my boyish thoughts were
Of Duty and Devotion, and Her, the peerless
maid;
The cream of Joy lay richly upon the Milk of
.Life,
And Grief, a doubtful shadow, dwelt far in outer
strife.
Aye, then my days were younger; the world
was wide and new,
And Love a scented rosebud fresh opened in the
dew.
Mhere high o’er Illawarra the iron mountains
stand
Like watchful knights in armor, to guard a
precious land,
The blue smoke spirals drifted, so soft and lazily,
Across the glossy jungles and eastward to the sea;
When down the Bulli passes I went with laugh
and song
To beat the brushy coverts away to Tomeror.g,
To shoot the rushes over and fish the salt lagoons,
With Youth, a gay musician, to play me trumpet
Oh, pleasant were the camp fires on that Arcadian
way—
The sun along Shoalhaven, the wind on Jervis
Bay,
The ripened figs downfalling in brushes cool and
dun,
Where fled the blue flock pigeon and flashed the
waiting gun.
The rain on Illawarra it drips the ferny fronds,
The wind on Illawarra sweeps down the reedv
ponds.
Who tastes her lotus seasons, who gloats her
Oircean shore,
Shall pine for all her beauty, enchanted ever
more.
On tracks of ruder travel, beyond the vulgar
rails,
Where swag and spur hold empire, and seldom
come the mails ;
On border tracks and by-roads, through gullies
and divides,
Where, easy in his saddle, the lean Australian
rides;
The perfumed myall burning to whitest ash away ;
The smoky red-gum falling in embers red and
grey ;
The forest oak that crackles, the ti-tree twigs that
flare,
Since then have brought me comfort and cooked
my rough bush fare.
Smoke pillars slow uprising; the billv and the
grill,
Pass sweet in recollection. By creek, lagoon and
rill
I see the picture splendid no artist e’er hath
limned,
I hear the wondrous poem no poet yet hath
hymned.
By verdant Ulladulla, by Tathra where the tide
Breaks round the rocky foreshore, and ill the
coasters ride
By Eden, coyly nestled amid her sapphire bays,
They glow like treasured rubies, the fires of
days. °
On halcyon Mallacoota, where, avid from the seas,
The fresh-caught schnapper flashes in dying
agonies
His jewels opalescent. Where safe the black
duck breeds
By lakes remote and distant amid the further
reeds;
Where seaward lights go winking the night seas
up and down,
To bring the lonely bushfolk far whispers of the
town,

Of mountain ash and blackbutt, where chilly

On many-strearaed Monaro, whence, clear as

From natal fountains wander the rivers, east and

Along- the great main mountains, from Bau-Bau
to the Downs—
Betimes in rugged out-tracks, at times by upland
towns,
In mem ry pictures lifting their blue, ascendant
spires,
I watch again the glow of my dear old gypsv
fires.
The Black Soil Plains have known them, the
Flams of Riverine,
The clumps of stunted wilga, the Richmond
jungles green ;
And down the clear Macquarie, the sandy Castle-

The Namoi and the Barwon they glowed bv

Yankee Uriah.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
ILLAMULLA lost its respectability when
the schnapper steamer made headquarters of
Illamulla Bay. Instantly the little hundred-
ton fishing boat steamed up to its moorings the
town became demoralised. The personality of one
man was responsible for all this. This was
Yankee Uriah the skipper.
there was something about Uriah which weak-
ened a man morally. The most decently domesti-
cated man who came into Uriah’s company wanted
to get drunk immediately. The American always
went hot-paced into temptation.
I’ve read about Captain Dampier, and Bully
Hayes, and a lot more sea buccaneers; but Yankee
Uriah was the nearest approach to those sort of
men I’ve ever seen in the flesh. He never told
anybody that he once held a master’s certificate,
and had wrecked ships ; but the way he talked of
the method of managing a ship, and losing a ship,
and of suspended certificates, left vivid impres-
sions, and you invariably left his company with
the idea that he had piled many a boat up on the
rocks. Without ever having seen the man do it, I
can always imagine Uriah steering a ship at a
reef, with a cigar in his mouth and one eye
cocked.
He was the ugliest man I’ve ever seen. His
face must have been dipped in boiling oil when the
skin was impressionable. It looked as if it should
be sandpapered. His mouth was like a worm,
and when he smiled it wriggled its head and tail
almost imperceptibly. The eyes were like marbles
(drab commoners); but when the ends of the worm
squirmed a droll light of wicked humor gleamed
in them. Under the worm was a single tuft of
whisker the size of a sixpenny piece. You would
think the man would grow whiskers if only to
hide his face; but Uriah was as vain of being
ugly as a pretty girl is of her looks.
He had many yarns, but his favorite story, was
of a skipper who wrecked his ship and brought
the binoculars ashore in the boat. The moral
was, Yankee Uriah wouldn’t have come ashore in
his shirt.
Secretly the Illamulla folks liked the Ajax days
to come round. There is a lot of cant in people’s
horror of sin. Sin in other people is delightful.
It is not your immortal soul that is being juggled
with. It was a deadly dull time when the Ajax
was fishing up and down the coast; when the
boat was moored it was interesting to watch
things. Uriah led the way. He was always in
the greatest hurry. The rest came as if'they
were yielding to temptation. Almost the only
man in the town who was not glad to see them
was the publican ; yet they nearly always paid for
their drinks while they were sober. The con-
stable disliked those days too. He was a yery
domesticated man, and liked his hearth and home;
and it meant having important business in distant
parts of his district.
Sometimes the Ajax kept at its moorings a week
at a time. This was in heavy weather, of course.
Illamulla Bay described a boomerang, and the
wharf stretched obliquely from one point. This
made it perfectly safe in all winds but a black
nor -easter. A stiff sou -wester was also dangerous
if a boat parted from its moorings. In such cases
it would go right out to sea.
When the white horses came racing up from the
south, boats used to come in and shelter at Illa-
mulla. You would always find the population of
the town near the lighthouse on a heavy day, each
individual speculating which of the passing boats
would put in. Such days at Birrell’s ! Yankee
Uriah would take the weather-bound in tow, and
tell Birrell to “strap it up.” Now, Birrell bad
the picture of “ Poor Trust ” in his bar ; also “ No
Tick ” across the face of a clock with no hands •
but he always obliged any of the Ajax crew. He
used to explain : “ They will pav me if they can
poor fellows.” And this was true. There was
not a man among them who was mean, but they
wanted a heap more liquor than they could pay
One afternoon, when it was blowing a terrific
gale from the south-west, the Ajax crew came
trailing up to Birrell’s, Uriah leading by fifteen
yards. One of the crew carried a gallon billycan,
and another had a square-faced bottle tucked
under either arm When they had all lined along
the bar, Yankee Uriah noticed a man sitting in a
corner with a swag at his feet.
He was an ill-favored fellow, and extra-ragged,
h ! s swa # was also a dilapidated one. His
attitude conveyed the idea that he was not
notming the crew, and yet expected that they
should ask him to ioin them

I
A Prospector's Sufferings— Tortured by Retching and
Pains in Head and Chest-Other remedies Useless.
The following case of Mr. F. Paulin, a
miner and prospector, living at King’s
Plains, near Blayney, N.S.W., demon=
strates to those who suffer from bilious=
ness the wonderful virtues of Bile Beans
for this most sickening of complaints.
Bile Beans cured Mr. Paulin after 18
months’ continual failure of other so=called
remedies, which is proof of the triumph
of Bile Beans over all other medicines.
“For about 18 months I was in the grip of
biliousness and indigestion,” says Mr. Paulin-
“ I often thought my head would burst, so
severe were the agonising pains which afflicted
me, and frequent fits of retching would send
pains shooting through my head with a terrible
throbbing. I could not eat any food without
experiencing nasty, uncomfortable feelings and
pains in the chest. My appetite completely
failed me, and I became thoroughly miserable.
I consulted a doctor, and tried many so-called
remedies, but in vain. I was recommended by
1
fife
a friend to try Bile Beans, and to make sure I would act on his recommendation,
he bought a box of the Beans, and I started on them. I gained great relief from
the very first dose, and after continuing the course to the extent of four boxes,
I was completely cured. Since then I have had no return of the complaints, and
as it is two years since the cure was effected, I think I may safely say that I
am permanently restored to health.”
THE STANDARD FAMILY MEDICINE.
IMPURE BLOOD.
The existence of bad blood in the system is shown
by the presence of boils, pimples, blotches, eruptions, etc.
In order to eradicate the causes of which the above are the
effects, it is necessary that the blood should be cleansed of
all impurities. Bile Beans act directly upon the liver, thus
becoming the agent by which pure, healthy blood is cir-
culated through the system. Bile Beans have cured the
severest forms of bad blood, from the common pimple to the
worst scrofulous sore.
Bile Beans are a reliable
remedy for indigestion,
biliousness, headache,
constipation, dizziness,
and the whole host of dis-
tressing ailments which
owe their origin to a sick
liver. Price 1/U&2/9 per box
of all chemists and stores.
Beauty’s Favourite.
The article which excels all others
in improving the beauty of the sKin
is naturally and deservedly beauty’s
favourite. This has been the
acknowledged and honoured
position held by Pears’ Soap for
nearly 120 years. It won, and has
maintained that position by virtue
of its complete purity, and by the
possession of those special emollient
properties which soften, refine,
and impart natural colour to the
sKin. No other soap possesses
these qualities in such a pre-
eminent degree as
PEARS
Matchless for the Complexion.
“ Saay, straanger. You kin jine us.”
“I’m not pertickler, guv’nor,” said the swag-
man, awkwardly rising, and lounging up slowly.
It would not be etiquette to rush it.
After a few rapid drinks, Uriah said to the
stranger :
“ Reckon I was sizin’ yer up afore I asked yer
to jine us. I knowed I’d like yer as soon as I
spotted yer.”
The swagman looked modest.
“Guess yer the most all-fired ugly man I’ve
ever so' eyes on—’cept.in’ meself,” went on Uriah,
with humor wriggling at the corners of his worm.
“ Fact, boys, eh ? ”
The crew admitted it, and the swagman grinned
in a sickly way.
“Can’t help yer looks, boss,” he growled.
“Wal, yer kin paint an’ powder yerself if yer
wants ter look elegant; but ef yer rale ugly, look
ugly, an’ people won’t think the less of yer.”
And Uriah slapped him on the back encourag-
ingly.
“And now,” he added, “ ef yer burnin’ ter pay
for the next tiddley, ver’d better hurry, ’cause we
must get aboard.”
The swagman admitted that he was stony, so the
gallon billycan and the two square-faced bottles
were filled with beer, and the crew went aboard,
taking the stranger with them at Uriah’s invita-
tion.
After that an inter m ittent noise on the schnapper
boat could be heard all round the bay. N ow and
again a member of the crew would be seen to come
up and jump into the dingey and pull ashore with
the gallon billycan and a square-faced bottle.
After returning from one such trip the man fell
overboard and was seen struggling in the water.
Simultaneously Uriah came on deck and was heard
to roar, “The son of a gun has broken the blanky
bottle.” The fate of the man would have been hor-
rible had he lost the billycan as well. As it was, he
was fished out with a boathook, and the deck was
deserted again. A peculiar thing about these
orgies was that silence always reigned for a short
time after the arrival of fresh beer.
Captain Uriah was never so strong on wrecking
as that evening. He went more into detail on the
crass foolishness of the skipper bringing his
binoculars ashore than ever, and hinted pictu-
resquely of his own superior methods.
Harvey, the educated man of the crew, gave
some incidents in his experience of embezzlement.
It was generally believed that he had been a
cashier in a bank at one time. The grounds of
his conversation gave that idea. He did not say,
“I did this” or “I did that,” but “I knew a
fellow who did this or that,” and all the time a
pride in the narration and the hero-worship in it
let anybody know that he was that fellow.
Jack .Tones also boasted of his badness consider-
ably. Jones had been employed in the blackbird-
ing business, and you know what that means.
Some of his tales of the islands were sensationally
gory.
Every man there had something desperately
sinful to boast about, and he boasted. The swag-
man said little, but his evil eyes glinted, and you
could see his ears twitch as they devoured all the
vaporings. Now, the crew were not good men,
but in the main they were as much fools as rogues.
It was beer that talked that evening. At last
the swagman stood to his feet.
“ Things is not always what they seem, gen’l’-
men,” he said. “ I have listened to yez all, and
sed nothin’. Why ? ’Cause I don’t believe in
givin’ yerself away. It’s not clever, ter say the
least of it. Yer’v’e all had yer little affairs. Very
good. To look at me yer’d think nuthin’. 'V cry
good. Here’s me, a common-lookin’ swagman.
There’s me swag, a-lookin’ no better than meself.
Mortal eyes can only see skin deep. Yer can’t
see me inside. Yer can’t see the inside of me
swag. If that swag could talk —but I’m not
agoin’ ter say nuthin’. What was it Napoleon
says: ‘ Every soldier what serves in the French
harmy has a marshal’s baton in his swag.’ I’m
not in the French harmy, gen’l’men, but yer don’t
know what’s in me swag. Think I’ll sit down. ’
And he sat down, somewhat heavily. A man
can’t drink all one afternoon and do otherwise.
After that the eyes of Yankee Uriah turned
very frequently to the swag.
At last he said, “Jack, take the paddles out of
the dingey.”
“ What for?” asked Jack.
“Do what yer told,”.said the captain, shortly.
Jones returned in a little while, and shortly
after Yankee Uriah said : “It’s up ter somebody
ter go up ter Birrell’s.”
“I’ll go,” said everyone of the crew. This
was a labor of love.
Uriah fixed a firm eye on the stranger.
“Guess it’s up ter the swagman ter make this
trip.” .
“ I’m not much of a hand with a boat, said the
swagman, blankly. .
“ Air yer goin’, or won’t yer go, which ? asked
Uriah in his commander accents.
“ Certainly, I’ll go,” said the man, rising.
“You stop below, Jones. What requires doin’
I’ll do meself.”
Uriah and the stranger disappeared up the
companion. The rest of the crew put their heads
up to see what occurred. It was quite dark.
The captain assisted the man into the dingey, and
then threw off the line. Yankee Uriah was say-
ing as the small boat drifted out, “Yer want ter
be careful with that squareface, stranger. It’s the
last bottle we’ve got.” .
Then a voice came from over the side, ‘ I can t
find the oars.”
“ Yer sure they ain’t there ? ”
“ Yes. Throw me a line.”
Uriah was heard throwing a line.
“Throw again, quick, or I’ll be blown-out ter
sea.” ,
Uriah fumbled with the rope a long time and
threw again.
“ Hev yer got it ? ”
“ No, it won’t reach. What am I ter do .
“Kin you pray, stranger?”
No answer.
“Guess yer’d better say yer prayers, that s all-.
You’re bein’ blown right into eternity.”
Then the captain came below.
“ Guess we’ll look into that swag,” he said.
But there was nothing of value in it—two old
blankets, a ragged shirt, a “housewife” (needle
and cotton and some buttons), and a pair of
trousers as ragged as the shirt.
“ I knew there was nothing in it, said Harvey.
“ But the derned fool sed there wuz,” said the
captain.
“ It was a metaphor.
“ A what-afor ? ” . „ , TT
“A metaphor is something’’—began Harvey,
eloquently.
“Kin yer eat it?’
“No.”
“ Kin yer drink it, or pawn it l
“No.”
“Well, shut up.” _
The captain was in a bad humor. He began
feeling in the trousers pockets, and at length
drew out a crumpled bit of paper which he spread
out on the table and carefully examined.
“Wal. boys,” he exclaimed at length, “ I guess
I’ve figured out the swagman's marshal’s baton at
last. Read that, Harvey.”
Harvey took the paper, and after puzzling a bit,
read :
Nowra Rd. sm. Big Bloodwood. Ist P. 3 notches.
Snide.”
“Meanin 5 ?” interrogated Uriah.
“ Dunno, unless he has treasure buried at the
Ist P. 3 notches, whatever that means.”
“It’s clear, Harvey, and I reckon a bab kin
figure that out. First post with three notches cut
in it past a big bloodwood on the Nowra-road.
Boys, this craft will have to git laid up for a few
days. Her bottom wants scraping. Guess we 11
git out on the wallaby. Thet straanger now blow-
ing away to the South Sea Islands won t want ter
visit that post, and, if he does, he’ll git there too
late.’’ ,
“It’s a bad business,” said Harvey. ‘ L don t
like this kind of work ; but if there’s anything in
it at the end I’ll not object to sharing the profits.
Next morning Uriah was heard lustily bellowing
for a dingey to be brought off from the shore.
Someone pulled to the side and asked what was
wrong:.
“Oh, nothin’. I jest guess our old dingey was
blown out ter sea last night.”
“ How did that come about ? Hadn’t you tied
her up ?”
“ Oh, yes ; but there wuz a man in her.”
“Not the swagman you had last night?”
“ Aye.”
“ Oh, he’s locked up, and your dingey is tied
up to the wharf. Somebody was on the wharf and
heard him shouting for help, and they threw him
a line. He went up to the pub then, and at last
had to be arrested to give us a chance of getting
to sleep.” _
“It’s up ter me to interview that swagman,
said Uriah, severely.
In fact, they all interviewed him with the view
of compelling him to conduct them to where the
treasure was buried. Being influential men in
the township, and held much in awe by the local
policeman, they obtained his liberation, and the
charge of riotous conduct was dropped.
In the pub Uriah spread the paper out on a
table, and asked for an interpretation. The swag-
man interpreted.
“ Five miles along Nowra-road you come to a
big bloodwood. You go on till you come to a
house. The first gate-post has three notches cut
into it. Don’t miss this ; good tucker here.”
“An’ there’s no marshal’s-baton business in it
at all?” asked Uriah, sternly.
“ Yes, straight griffin. There’s no man on the
roads of Noo South knows the good tucker houses
like me, Captain.”

A Suggestion
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
O TEMPERANCE Reformers,
Who loathe the Demon Drink,
I offer a suggestion
Worth coin to you, I think,
Let up on Sunday trading,
The Barmaid, too, forgive—
Poor little powdered party,
She has some right to live.
Remember what the Bible
Has on the question said :
Look not (if you are wise) on
The wine when it is red.
Now, if instead of showing
The hue of royal blood,
The wine were of the color
Of coffee, or of mud —
Think ye it would not matter
To drinkers such as I ?
If not ye know but little
The pleasure of the eye.
When I am clothed and sober,
And in my proper mind,
And all desire for liquor
Is left a league behind—
What is the sight that haunts me
And draws me from afar ?
It is the shining vision
Of bottles in the bar !
No flowers from a garden,
No jewels from a mine,
Like bottles in a bar-room
Do bravely bloom and shine.
I see the topaz sherry,
The damask port I see,
And glowing like a garnet
The wine of Burgundy.
I see the pale-gold whisky
The bane of public men—
The drink that lays out many
A leading citizen.
I see the rum so ruddy—
Jamaica rum, I think
That glows like a carbuncle,
The poets’ fatal drink.
The green chartreuse, and yellow,
The curagoa pale,
They flash and gleam before me—
But O, the amber ale !
The brave colonial beer that
Is drawn behind the bar
It has a plume of foam like
The white plume of Navarre.
When taste, and strength, and odor
Of liquors I contemn,
Their splendid colors lure me,
And drag me back to them.
So, Temperance Reformers,
Pray act upon this hint
All drinks must have, in future,
One drab repulsive tint.
And, if you act upon it,
We all shall sober be—
When wine and ale and whisky
' * "‘Are colored like cold tea.

“Four years ago I had to stop shearing, as I suffered
so with rheumatism, caused by the damp sheep. As the
36
\
liniments and medicines I tried
did me no good, I thought seri-
ously of going to the hospital,
but was induced to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. From the first bot-
tle I began to get better. I took
seven bottles in all, and I now am
free from pain,-and can eat and
sleep grandly. I feel like a new
man.” A. H. Watson,
Grawler, S. A.
This is one of very many letters testifying to the value of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla in cases of rheumatism. Keep your blood pure by using
