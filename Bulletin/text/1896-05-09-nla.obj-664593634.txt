THE OBJECTS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS TO BE FORMED ARE AS FOLLOWS
L —To acquire by purchase the land situated at CROYDON, QUEENSLAND, being the whole of
the Gold mining Property known as the KING OF CROYDON NO. 1 NORTH AND
P. C. AMALGAMATED GOLD-MINING CLAIMS, and held under Gold-mining Lease
No. 617. 2.—To acquire (if desirable) other valuable ground adjoining that comprised in the
said lease. 3.—To explore, work, and mine all properties to be acquired by the Company.
The Vendors agree to sell to the Company the said claims for 30,000 shares fully paid up. The
document, dated 12th March, 1896, containing the conditions upon which the Vendors agree to sell
may be inspected at the office of the Broker.
The only charges to be made will be the initial expense of floating and registering the Company.
The property to be acquired is 10 acres in area (which can be increased, if necessary, to 16 or 20
acres), and is situated about six miles from the township of Croydon. Both the claims are the very
pick of the King line, and are amongst the largest producers of gold in that line, and have been worked
for the last 10 years. The want of capital to develop them systematically has been the only obstacle
to retard their progress. The following returns, taken from the Warden’s Office, Croydon, show the
arushings up to the present time :

The ore is not of a refractory nature, as the present owners sent 16 tons of stone obtained from
these claims to N. Parker and Company, Footscray Works, Melbourne, for which they paid the
owners £l5 per ton, and that firm informed them the best mode of treatment for the ore was the
ordinary stamper battery, and plenty pf grinding in the Berdan pans.
The present owners also, in January last, had forty (40) tons of surface soil well screened, and
then crushed and obtained a yield of to the ton. There is a large quantity of this class of soil
upon the giound, and with a battery belonging to the Company it should pay well. The owners of
the claim adjoining are crushing similar surface soil with their own battery, and make 4Jdwt. to the
ton pay.
The proposed mode of working (should the Company be formed) is as follows :—lt will be
noticed, on reference to the plan, that a proposed new underlie shaft is shown thereon. With this
new shaft, which (to reach the point wished to be got at, viz., the deep block shaft) will need to go
3G9ft. odd, and will be in reef country the whole way, with the certainty of getting the good stone
which has been worked in shaft marked “ A.” This stone should be cut in the new underlie shaft at
about 120 ft., and is the reef from which the last crushing that went B£oz. to the ton was taken, and
this reef remains even richer than when the last crushing was taken out. Then, again, in regard to
the proposed underlie shaft, there is every possibility of stacking good stone from the start, as the
shaft will commence from the cap of the reef. It is proposed to let a contract to sink the underlie
shaft, say, 200 ft.
At the commencement, up to the first 120 ft. or 200 ft., an engine and pump could be hired at Croy-
don for about £3 or £3 10s. per week, but after that distance is reached it would be advisable to buy a
good engine and pump.
The following paragraphs, under the head of “ Mining Intelligence,” appeared in the issue of the
Croydon Golden Age of the 21st February, 1896 : —“ The Glencoe Gold-mining and Recovery Com-
pany has been registered in Melbourne as a No Liability Company, with a capital of £40,000, divided
into 40,000 shares of .£1 each ;of these, 24,000 are fully,paid up, and go to the vendors. The Krupp
ball dry crusher for the Glencoe mine is en board the Duke of Argyll, which sailed from London at
the beginning of January, and should, therefore, arrive at Thursday Island at the end of February.
The cyanide vats will be shipped by the next boat from the South by Rodney Brothers, of Townsville.”
This mine is in the immediate neighborhood of the claims to be acquired by the Company, as also
is the “ Waratah,” a mine which was recently floated in England ; and a late telegram from Croydon
states that rich stone has been struck at depth of over 500 ft. on the underlie shaft.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne's Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have takan this medicine are amused
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. \V. G. HEARNE.— Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, front which I suffered
for upwards of seven yeais, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently Ihe diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I wiile you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, ns in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year.previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at thejiino I obtained your
medicine I was confined to berl suffering from a most
violent cough, exp'ctoratiug blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improvi d as I continu'd the treatment, until I lie ante,
as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The in ise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great, anxiety. I tried several treat-
m nts. Gough mixtures and poultices were us‘d and
plasters were applied to the back and cbtst without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle ef Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy bad taken this medicine for about
10 days be was perfectly cured.— J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Taimvorth, N.S.W.”
* We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly proi". its distinct, healing power.”- Signed

Dr. aIBBOMS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Si SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
J more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
j 'ng symptoms, namely I—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, he..,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

BEFORE YOU
T. B A q i
When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and C,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
George-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing
she ever so sweetly ; heed not the voice of
the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned ; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “ There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round—
and the tax-gatherer won’t take no for an
answer—for you to plead : There would have

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You can see their rudder hissing
1 ast your canvas, and the kissing
1 the wash that fans behind them on your bow-
side makes her roll;
And your coxswain’s calling “Quicker ! ”
As your breath comes thick and thicker,
xSut you put in half-a-dozen fit to bust your blessed
soul.
And the boat is leaking badly,
And you fling your weight on madly;
.nut your stick has got no packing and it runs
down every dip;
And your instep’s sore and skinning,
Still you keep a hope of winning
I ill the wind flips on your oar-blade and you bend
your stretcher-clip.
Every man is outward swinging,
And a dull and sullen singing
Is vibrating in your ear-drums as you feel them
screw and squirm;
And, through your faultless hauling,
You can hear their youngster calling
That you’re too almighty slow to catch a paralytic
worm.
Then there sounds a scraping under
And your seat and slide’s asunder ;
While you’re spitting chips like thunder and your
knees are fairly broke ;
And the streams of sweat near blind you
As you damn the mugs behind you ;
Or, if you’re three or two or bow, you blame the
rotten stroke.
Then you strike the grip and feather;
Whip a few in hell-for-leather,
And you’re swinging all together just like clock-
work for a spell—
Then the wind comes round an angle
And your form gets in a tangle,
And you’re chucking up the water and the time is
all to hell.
Then you see their wash runs stronger -
And decide to hang out longer,
Till at last amid the swirling pools their rudder
starts to peep ;
And your heart grows big and bigger
As you spot their coxswain’s figure,
And inch by inch along their side you slowly crawl
and creep.
Then you think how far the boat is
Erom the winning-post; no notice
You take of form or feeling, time or troubles,
needs or knack;
With the swaying, swinging, sweeping
Of the oars you feel her leaping,
And you feel the muscles swelling on your
shoulders and your back.
For their stroke looks done ; the catch he
Sets is slow and short and scratchy,
And their bow has cracked up badly; he’s a deader
to the world;
Ho ! their barrackers yell louder,
And they graft like nigs to crowd her,
But there’s nothing left but arm-work in them :
all their backs are curled.
Loud and louder grow the raging
Cries that echo from the staging,
And you pop on half-a-dozen with all your skill
and strength;
Then, with resting arms before you,
Rings the judge’s pistol o’er you,
And you’ve done them like a dinner by an easy
half-a-length.
Melb.
MONTAGUE GROVER.
Mr. Justice Dowling, a former N.S.W.
Chief-Justice, once sentenced a man, convicted of
stealing a pair of oars, to one month’s gaol, and,
at the end of that period, to be flogged at the
cart’s tail from the police-station to the wharf in
King-st.
In a Melb. restaurant, the other night, a
certain flash young jock condescended to chaff his
two middle-aged companions, one of whom had
“ shouted ” the dinner. “ Look at me, and kick
yourselves,” said the sarcastic lightweight, “ sweet
twenty, dear boys, with all my life before me.
Why, you’ve been through all the fun you talk
about, but mine, mine is only just coming on.”
The grey-haired sinner seated opposite nodded his
head scornfully, put his elbows on the table,
peered into the hairless countenance of the sweet
twenty-year-old, and snarled, “You’ll never live
to go through it.” A fair answer. What said
the Spectator, of August 25th, 1711? “The
youth, indeed, hopes for many more days, so can-
not the old man. The youth’s hopes are ill-
grounded, for what is more foolish than to place
any confidence upon an uncertainty ? But the old
man has not room so much as to hope ; he is still
happier than the youth, he has already enjoyed
what the other does but hope for. One wishes to
live long, the other has lived long.” And the
Spectator was thinking of ordinary youths, not
of champagne-swilling boys, who daren’t put on a
decent layer of flesh to protect ’em from the weather.

"Ministers have been banqueting and speech-making, and receiving deputations, from the Queen laml lnorlor to Broken-hill, and people every part of

SATURDAY, MAY 9, 1896.
A Woman and an Ass.
The South Australian election, now practi-
cally completed, is the first held on this con-
tinent in which the woman-voter has been a
factor, and her presence has served to make
the contest more than usually interesting.
The result has upset many calculations, and
turned much elaborate prevision into mock-
ery. When the great aggregate woman first
took a hand in Maoriland politics, the con-
sequence was so wholly unlike what was
generally expected that it was commonly set
down as a remarkable exception to an other-
wise reliable rule ; the repetition of the same
experience in S.A. creates a doubt whether
the exception isn’t really the rule and the
alleged rule itself a delusion. For many
years it has been the custom to regard woman
as the buttress of Conservatism and the
main support of priestcraft —as a being
whose irruption into politics would mean
retrogression, Toryism, the re-establish-
ment of clerical influence in educational
matters, and a general going back to
the old ideals. Woman, it was supposed,
was several centuries behind man, in a poli-
tical sense, and accordingly when John
Hall, the narrowest and most hidebound
Tory of his country and generation, first
seriously advocated the female suffrage in
Maoriland, he did it with the conviction that
the woman vote would help him to get back
to his own ideals, which were those of the
Middle Ages, or thereabouts. Now the new
order of things has had two separate trials
in two widely-removed provinces, and thus
far the result has proved either that woman
isn’t so far behind as was supposed, or else
that man isn’t so far advanced as he has de-
clared himself, on his own unsupported
authority, to be. So far as can be ascer-
tained the woman vote, both in Maoriland
and S.A., has gone quite as solidly for the
Democratic cause as that of the male voter,
and there has been no retrogression, no
upheaval of the clerical influence, no great
National Ass victory, and none of the other
things that were confidently anticipated.
* * * *
The S.A. Government appealed to the
country on two distinct issues. It asked for
a general approval of the Kingston Ministry
and its Democratic policy, and it called for a
popular vote on the question of maintaining
the present system of secular education or
reverting to denominationalisin. On this
second issue it was believed in many quarters
that the female vote would give a substantial
majority to the clerical interest. It is com-
monly assumed that woman is the main sup-
port of the Church ; that she forms the
largest half of the congregation in the white-
washed tabernacle where the priest drones
out his Sunday platitudes ; and that she has
a capacity for believing the aged story of
Jonah and other old and tough statements,
and a faculty for taking her creed seriously,
which are absent in the other sex. This
theory rested, in part, upon the census-paper
wherein the male citizen describes himself as
a “freethinker” or an “agnostic” much
more frequently than the female, but this
may have merely implied that the male
takes his atheism seriously and the female
doesn’t. Otherwise it rested mainly on
legend; it was one of these statements built on
the assertion of somebody that nobody ever
definitely heard of, which survives for want of
any positive evidence either one way or
another. The S.A. election has, however,
brought it into serious discredit. ‘ ‘ The
godless system of education ” came out on
top by an overwhelming majority. The
woman elector has reported that she doesn’t
want denominationalism at any price, and it
would seem that the she-Australian believes
in the clerical fetish about as much as the
he, or perhaps a little more, but at all events
not enough to make her faith a matter worth
mentioning.
The woman suffrage has done one or two
other things which were not expected of it,
and it has left undone various things which
certainly were expected. The Kingston
Government—the most distinctly democratic
Ministry S.A. has yet possessed was
strengthened instead of being overthrown.
The Labor wing of the Government party
was strengthened even more than the direct
Ministerial following, so the present Assem-
bly is more aggressively liberal than its prede-
cessor. In the frantic kaleidoscope of S.A.
politics it is very rarely indeed that a Govern-
ment has survived a whole Parliament as the
Kingston Ministry has done. The preceding
Parliament (the thirteenth in S.A. history)
saw three Ministries live and die. The
eighth Parliament survived four separate
Ministries. The seventh Parliament saw
three Cabinets come and go, and leave
hardly a ripple on the political surface. The
fourth Parliament, during its three years’
existence, killed off four Cabinets and badly
crippled a fifth. The third Parliament also
killed off four ephemeral Governments and
left a fifth in a state of ruin and disruption.
The second saw three Governments rise and
fall; and the first one wrecked three Minis-
tries also, while another Ministry perished
during the elections which followed.
When a S.A. Government has come safely
through an election without dying of the
process it has invariably returned with no
majority worth mentioning, and only lived
afterwards as a matter of form. According
to all the precedents of the province the
Kingston Ministry’s case was hopeless from
sheer old age, because it has already lived
longer than any other Cabinet in S.A.
It was alleged to be doubly hopeless
because, in addition to the old electors, who
were tired of it in the natural course
of things, it had to reckon with a vast mass
of new electors who were supposed to be
constitutionally'jrostile to it because it was
a Democratic and “Godless” administra-
tion. And, in the facp of all these prognos-
tications, Kingston and his colleagues have
come back with, to all appearance, a stronger
following than they had three years ago —a
thing which never happened before in the
quicksand of political life, as it is, or used to
be, at the Holy City. Such a result as this
breaks up the old theories and the old
National Ass, and leaves everything in a
state of uncertainty and bewilderment.
* * * *
Further, there was no great outbreak of
faddism, as was commonly anticipated. The
alleged Shrieking Sisterhood didn’t shriek to
any extent worth mentioning. The Cold Tea
element didn’t have a great day out; in fact,
it seems to have been rather less in evidence
than usual. The Social Purity Society,
which raged so fearfully in the City of
Churches nine or ten years ago, and has
raged more or less ever since, was so much
swamped in the general Democratic move-
ment that it could hardly be said to be
seriously in evidence. The Age of Consent
was talked about apparently no more than
usual, and the divided skirt was seen
just about as much as usual. The woman
voter didn’t blunder over her ballot-paper
much more than the average male. The
hysterical she-politician with her hair a-
hanging down her back, who was to rave
through the length and breadth of the land,
while a menial at home held the infant
upside-down with one hand, and read about
the impossible “ jook ” in the London Jour-
nal with the other, didn’t rave to any notice-
able extent, and her hair was much as it
generally is, and her strangled infant, so
far, hasn’t been heard about. The parson
appealed to the female element of his flock
m vain : either the woman doesn’t go to
church any more than the man, or else she
goes for amusement, or to exhibit her bon-
net, or else she keeps religion and business
strictly separate. ‘ In short, nothing hap-
pened as it was expected to happen, and
everything was upside down, unexpected and
unorthodox. The only visible result so far
is that the democratic vote is distinctly
stronger, and the Natio te^fall m
with a g r eat fall _, and than that
greater stability m k.A. ,P
province has yet exhibitec #

more grounds : one, that sn naturally

Conservative, and the other tha ■
vote the Democratic ticket because she wa^
naturally nothing m particular »i
go with the crowd. It was likewise p
out that she didn’t understand politics that
she had no stability of purpose, and that she
was an emotional being whose moods ’ a ’
consequently, whose politics, were alwaju
changing from no visible reason—the maL
voter, whose stability and comprehension ot
politics is such that S.A. has had 42 Govern-
ments in 40 years, being naturally free fiom
these defects. And, finally, it was pointed out,
on the unsupported assurance of the average
man, that he was so vastly superior to the
average woman that her admission o
political equality with him was wholly
absurd and unwarrantable. How all these
matters stand may, possibly, be deter-
mined in the course of years. So tar, the
woman-voter is a comparatively new institu-
tion, and all that can be alleged with cer-
tainty is that, up to date, she seems to have
shown herself about as intelligent as the
man-voter, which isn’t necessarily saying
very much. In fact, considering all the idols
the man-voter has worshipped, and then
thrown bricks and mud at, and then wor-
shipped again, it is saying very little indeed.
“Within an Ace of Greatness.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Henry Parkes is dead. For a generation past
he has been a Problem : henceforth he will be a
Legend. When the historian of the future picks
with his hammer-point against the rocks of a long-
dead past, he will wonder what manner of man it
was that so impressed the strata of this epoch.
For certain it is that he who now lies in his
quiet grave at Faulconbridge~has permanently
stamped his individuality upon the formative
period of Australian constitutionalism. Many
abler men, nobler men, truer patriots, many souls
more worthy of enduring honor and of that affec-
tionate remembrance which constitutes the splen-
did immortality of genius, will leave upon the
drift and sands deposited by the floods of these
times fainter imprints, vaguer contours than those
left by Henry Parkes. Why it will prove so
when the man’s work will itself lack permanence
will be one of the riddles of Fate. We who are
close to him, who knew him in the breathing and
aggressive flesh, have assuredly failed to under-
stand Parkes, or to explain him ; and lack-
ing that intimate personal knowledge of the
greatness manifestly his in some respects, and
of the meanness as indubitably his in other
respects, with which alone it is possible to obtain
something like an accurate understanding of his
complex nature, how shall the student in distant
ages see the man as he was and understand his
strength, his weakness, or that implication of the
one and the other which was really his dominant
characteristic ?
* * * *
An appreciation of such a personage must neces-
sarily be imperfect. It is a philosophic common-
place that the historian will understand the man
who has bulked hugely in the public eye better
than the man’s own contemporaries, because he
sees him in perspective ; but it may be questioned
whether Parkes, the exception to so many rules,
may not be an exception to this also. Wrote
Newman to Manning, “ I find it difficult to
understand you.” Manning, upon this, might
have made mental comment, “I find it difficult
to understand myself.” Parkes has said, to the
writer’s positive knowledge, in one of those
moments of frankness with which, intercalated
with unnecessary and mischievous reticences, he
would as often as not distinguish a conversation :
“I cannot understand myself.” Yet however
dilatory and remittent in other particulars
in the labor and pain of self-analysis, Parkes
never failed. It was his pride, to the last hour of
his intellectual life, to know himself as no others
of the thousand who endeavored to gauge his
personality and measure his limitations could
possibly know him. Not infrequently does it
happen that a person who takes up such an atti-
tude is absolutely transparent. His self-revela-
tions are the easier to read because they are
unconscious. With Parkes, however, the case is
far different. I he mental force, the self-control,
the faculty and power of dramatic action possessed
by him m the years of his public life, were
such that it is very doubtful whether any man
intimately since he first mounted
th ,e i plane ° f political distinction could
have truly said upon reflection that he had
never misrend’ never been deluded, by what
he had once regarded as a perfectly Uncon-
scious unfolding by Parkes of his temperament
h.s desires his ambitions. Parkes, great in some

* * * *
“ During the second epoch ’’—for there were twc
p-reat divisions in Parkes’s life. No perceptible
fine of demarcation separates them, because in so
psychologically complex a nature it is impossible
to put the finger upon the day or year when certain
admirable qualities ceased to influence the man s
growth or when the vitalising sap was transformed
into a corrupting poison Yet it is not impossible
to discern a time when there was a differentiation
and a change in the essentials of Parkes s charac-
ter—a differentiation which progressed to contrast,
and a change for the worst. That time lies within
a vear or two, on one side or the other, of the in-
auguration of Responsible Government in New
South Wales. Parkes, the fervent-spirited patriot,
with the virile passion and sweeping imagination
of a large-minded statesman, died—tortured to
death under the weights, heavy and coercive, of
debt and financial disaster. Parkes, the oppor-
tunist and the histrion ; Parkes, who looked upon
life as a fiction, humanity as a puppet, politics as a
farce, patriotism and public spirit and freedom as
terms with which to juggle away the senses of the
people as conjurors juggle away the vision of their
patrons; Parkes, the charlatan—was born. In
that pseudo-autobiography of his, “Fifty Years
in the Making of Australian History, he penned
a phrase which stirred hundreds to loud laughter.
During the time when he was conducting the
Empire he passed through such storms and stress
that to have endured and survived “he must,” he
wrote, “ have been of the stuff of which martyrs
are made.” Parkes a martyr ! A fine joke, truly !
Was he not a humorist rather in thus writing?
Nay. Parkes—a humorist and a farceur in the
composition of most chapters of that book— to
write that sentence, dipped his pen into the very
reservoir of his life-blood; for in the mighty
struggle to keep the Empire alive, to pay his way,
to feed his family, to fight public foes and private
antagonism, and to resolutely pursue his ideal to
make the paper the trusted organ of an educated
democracy, he mounted to heights of self-abnega-
tion which can be described with truth only in
the term Martyrdom.
* * * *
Egotist always, in the first period as in the
second, Parkes was, till he wrote his last lines for
the journal he had founded and nourished with his
being, filled with the superb egotism of the martyr-
heart, between which and selfishness there is little
distinction. Well would it have been for the
splendour of *his record, the lustre of his fame, the
value of his achievements, and the lasting good of
these young countries, if he had been brave enough
and wise enough to continue to live in the in-
spiring atmosphere of self-devotion to great prin-
ciples. But once occasion had passed, Parkes
faltered, craved for less ethereal air, lost faith in
the ideals and purposes of humanity, furled the
wings of his soul. Behind him, to the moment
the control of the Empire passed out of his hands,
he had a life-story of strenuous endeavor and
of a noble, if imperfect, self-culture. It had
been stained, no doubt, by blunders, but the
mighty strength of the man, which had conquered
privation and ignorance and contumely, to that
moment had been ever on the side of the masses,
of right, of political and intellectual freedom.
With the fall of the Empire, Parkes fell. His
feet had been treading the path to the goal of
greatness; from that path he diverged at an
almost imperceptible angle, feeling that he could
regain it when and where he chose. Never yet,
however, in the history of individual man did
the glossy purples of true greatness droop a
second time to a point within his grasp. That
angle of divergence, as the years passed, became
wider and wider. Parkes had no choice but to
proceed along the path of deviation, and it has
brought him, after forty years—years of a dazzling
popularity, alternating with an abasement no less
remarkable—to a tomb whence scarce a soul out
side the circle of his friends would recall him.
* * * *
In the battle against transportation and in the
strife that preceded the establishment of Respon-
sible Government, Parkes (let it be ever remem-
bered to his honor !) was a foremost combatant on
behalf of popular rights. The truth was plain to
him then which he lost sight of in the years of his
political eminence—that there is little merit in a
political system that has not for its ultimate end
the improvement of social conditions and the
emancipation of society from the slavery imposed
by the ignorance and the poverty of the masses.
The iron of suffering had entered into Parkes’s
inmost nature; the fiery oratory of the Chartist
Pemberton (to whom in'his heart of hearts Parkes
bore the reverence and gratitude which one man
owes to another who has awakened within him the
desire to know and the capacity to think, and
who has given him a mastery over methods of
utterance) had planted in his intellect the germs
of a Liberalism which never wholly ceased to
fructify, however events in after-life mocked the
Liberal spirit; and the possibilities of colonial
development aroused his imagination and fer-
tilised his understanding. Never an exact or
an analytic reader, and deprived of the invaluable
aid to development which stimulative teachers can
communicate, Parkes had yet read widely, and from
die arsenal of English and American political
literature he drew- many a weapon to wield in the
great fights of the time. Against the territorial
privilege which the imperial authorities and most
of the landed and commercial classes would have
built up upon a renewal of transportation, and
against the privilege of a titled caste, for which
entworth, traitor to his own past and blind to
i e trend of his own actions, was manceuvring,
rarkes fought ably, and with that reckless expen-
! 1 ure ,°1 health and strength which at all times
e used in conflict. He was a great tighter then,
and a successful one. He won political pro-
minence and success by newspaper articles and
P a orm speeches. Nevertheless, in his triumphs
he consummated his private ruin. Correspondence

of whom was a master of brilliant and incisive
newspaper polemics, demonstrates that Parkes,
deficient in all the finer elements of culture of
which the others could boast, was in the excel-
lence of his literary works no whit inferior to any
one of them. Yes, Parkes could write, and he
could edit, and were his friends wise, they would
inscribe on his gravestone the words, “ He edited
the Empire in 1853-G.” The statutes, a long list
of which in the epoch of his decadence he was
fond of reciting as evidence of his statesmanship,
are nothing as intrinsic work, or as contributions
to formal legislation, compared with the shaping
and welding impulses that Parkes and the men
whom he influenced imparted to the body politic
in those fateful years.
* * • •
It has been a source of amazement to those who
were familiar with the magnificent virulence of
his opposition to the introduction of a hereditary
system into Australia, that he should have weakly
displayed in his later course an almost toadyish
appreciation of titles, and of the patronage of
titled personages. But Parkes, after the sixties,
was not the Parkes of the early constitutional
struggle. He had become cynical as to the
value placed by the masses, upon efforts for
their improvement; the “ arch-anarchist,” as
Wentworth had dubbed him most unjustly,
had had his fangs drawn. His re-entrance
into politics was marked by treacheries to
both men and principles ; his egotism now be-
came excuseless ; henceforth he played his part.
The power he had once sought because power was
an instrument of reform ceased to be magnetic,
and while he hungered still, and never ceased to
hunger, for power, he sought it to gratify a vanity
soon to become insatiable, and a spirit of revenge
-which could rejoice in calling to heel the “ crea-
tures ” that had once despised him. Titles, the
company of titled personages, the glitter of
imperialistic trumpery, of all that was symbolised
by the laced coat and silken breeches of the Wind-
sor uniform, and the ribbon and star of the
Michael and George, gained an added importance
in his sight, but not because of the reason com-
monly ascribed to him. While his intellect
remained virile, he estimated these things at their
true worth—he knew them for badges of servitude
and the insignia of flunkeys. Nevertheless, as
power for vanity’s sake was now to him a thing
desirable, and as the classes whom he now
sought to use looked upon the tokens of
flunkeyism as something which it was glori-
ous to possess, Parkes marched with the
powdered and the beplushed hating their
servility of soul and certainly hating himself for
using them. His statesmanship had resolved
itself into the employment of individual mean-
nesses for what he considered as the public good.
This explains how
This hind, of princes peer,
preferred at last to ally himself to the men to
whose thought a peer’s smile was heaven, and a
“riband to stick in their coats” a dower of
dignity. Amid the wreckage of his fortunes and
the shadows of failure he wanted the courage to
wait till the fitting moment returned for the re-
assertion of his native liberalism; and his exalta-
tion, he reasoned, was soonest obtainable by
making stepping-stones of prostrate souls. That
was Parkes’s cardinal blunder ; it accounted for
much, if not everything, of the O’Farrell shame—
it explains his alliances with the ultra-Tories of
his later Governments. Knowing well what he
was doing, and well weighing the cost, he reso-
lutely
Broke from the van and the freemen,
Sank to the rear and the slaves.
* * * •
“ The burning brand of shame ” upon Parkes’s
political life is not, however, his failure to make
his career of power and distinction harmonious
with his early aspirations : it is his conduct with
respect to the O’Farrell episode. The volume of
good produced by his legislative and administra-
tive acts may perhaps be measured not inac-
curately ; but it is beyond human calculation to
estimate the evils generated by his infamous
speeches at Kiama and Jamberoo, and by his pro-
ceedings as Colonial-Secretary in the Martin
Ministry, following upon the attempted assassina-
tion of the Duke of Edinburgh. To plant, and
once planted, to carefully nurture, the seeds of
religious feuds in the soil of a nascent nation, the
political system of which was not irreligious
because it gave the freest scope to all religions:
this was a crime against the Australian race.
Those seeds Parkes planted, and he nursed the
tender plants till they grew to monster luxuri-
ance. No defender of his course at the O’Farrell
time can ever raise the plea in his behalf that
lie erred in ignorance, and from a short-sighted
indifference to the consequences of his policy.
The very persons who profited by his actions dare
not now pronounce a syllable in his defence ; and
that he knew what the verdict of posterity would
be upon his deeds and words is clearly to be seen
from the care he has taken to preserve his version.
Not in his “Fifty Years” will that version be
found, but among the archives of a State institu-
tion in an Australian province—not the province
he cursed by his conduct —is enrolled a document
which will reveal to the people of a generation yet
unborn what Henry Parkes thought of himself at
the hour when he sent O’Farrell to his doom.
That document and a letter to Thomas Carlyle
will form his exculpation, and—of exculpation
he will receive no title.
* * * *
Of the massive mental qualities of the man there
is no space to write adequately. In oratory, there
flashed from him at times passages of electric
significance and of rhetorical vividness ; but a
really illustrious orator he was not, because he
never delivered, during recent years at least,
“ a great speech ” in which there was no false note,
no transgression of taste, no lapse into jejuneness
or chicanery. As an administrator, he lacked
capacity to master detail, and to evolve order
from a chaos of particulars. Saturated with the
shibboleths of English constitutionalism, he yet
had no sense of the action and interaction of
forces through which historical tendencies make
themselves manifest. As a constructive states-
man, he had recourse always to models or to
lieutenants. As the leader of a party, he was at
his best in fair weather : in the face of well-
organised and aggressive opposition he could
never rise'to those master-strokes of policy which
disarm while they defeat. As the head of a
Cabinet he could not utilise the vast potentialities
of men of strong individuality ; he could only
lead weaklings, for whom he cared so little that
he would not disguise from them that he spurned
while he led. Without the higher characteristics
of generalship, wanting which no politician merits
the name of statesman, he could not form com-
binations on a large scale. Certainly, as a parlia-
mentary strategist, he has only been equalled in
N.S. Wales by Cowper, and as the creator ot a
supixirt in the electorates on behalf of measures
for the principles of which the people had no in-
stinctive regard, the mother-province has never
seen his like. Who but Parkes could have swept
in tornado fashion through the country in 1887 and
m 1889 : Who but Parkes, of all Australasian
politicians, could have taken a series of dull ab-
stractions and have breathed into them such
vitality as the Federal movement possessed in
1889 possesses indeed to-day ? Yet in everything
failure ever attached to him—perfected results to
nothing. In his popular leadership he led, at the
last, weird shadows : in Parliament, a coterie of
spineless traitors. His latest electoral appear-
ances are among the most pitiable incidents of
Australian political life. Their one demonstrable
interest lay in their revelation of the abyss into
which he had been precipitated, and of the shame-
lessness of the erstwhile followers who had plunged
him into the lower deeps of those lowest depths.
* » * *
The man’s actual heart was, strangely though it
may sound, not in politics but in literature, in
history, and in art. There was a singular vein of
sentiment in his nature which found no appro-
priate vent in his public existence, but which was
best understood through the conditions of his
home life. He slept for years in a room on which
the principal wall ornaments were the portraits of
the Commonwealth men—Cromwell, Pym, Hamp-
den. To see him handle a letter of Tennyson’s or
Carlyle’s, or the simple autographs of Lincoln,
was to receive a lesson in reverence. Books and
other mementoes of the illustrious dead were to
him the wine of life. And yet he was no scholar
—scarcely even to be termed a student. As to his
own place in Literature, his poems are a by-word ;
his later prose work already forgotten.
* * * *
Of the moral element in Parkes’s nature, there
is no need to speak here, save in regard to that one
element of magnanimity, the note of a truly great
man. Of this quality, what evidence is there in
his speeches or his policy? He could taunt an
adversary on the floor of Parliament, and in the
same breath deride that opponent for having made
him —Parkes —a gift in terms which contained a
reference to circumstances respecting which smaller
men would have been dumb. He could fling to a
starving poet a Government post, and remind him
in the instant that he attached his signature to
the letter of appointment that the poet had once
held him—Parkes —up to ridicule.
♦ * * *
Henry Parkes is dead. He has died in the
fullness of years, and one wishes one could say
with perfect truth in the fullness of honor also ;
but to have died with honor laurelling his memory
he should have died long since. He has sur-
passed in length of life most public men, as he has
surpassed most in opportunities. But smaller
men have done more, because they were truer
men. And if we may not say that the nation
mourns him as it mourned Higinbotham and
Ballance, we can say that it hears of his death
with a regret sincere and poignant. Not because
of what he has done, however, but because of
what he has left undone.
* * * *
And so,leaving him in the company of the august
departed, to those mute memorials which have
fallen upon his grave-from the hands of those in
whose veins runs his blood, from the hands of
friends who feared while they obeyed, from the
hands of foes who admired while they feared, let
there be added only this phrase : “ He once stood
within an ace of greatness.”
P.W.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Mixed Railway Gauges.
Premier Reid proposes a simple method of
getting over the break-of-gauge difficulty at
Albury. His suggestion is that Victoria should
alter the railway from Albury to Melbourne to
the N.S. Wales gauge, and thus make things
right—presumably at its own expense—so far
as the main line is concerned. Considering
that the whole difficulty was caused by N.S.
Wales, which decided upon the broad gauge at
the beginning, induced the Victorians to adopt
that costly system for the sake of uniformity,
and then abandoned it and left Victoria in the
lurch, G. H. Reid’s proposal that 1 - Victoria
should stand the racket is somewhat interesting.
In any case this isn’t the time for alterations.
The Federal railway management will some
day have to fix up a uniform gauge for all
Australia, and the decision should be left to it.
At present there are in this continent about 2500
miles of line at 4ft. (the N.S. W. gauge) ;
about 3600 miles on the Victorian sft. 3iu.
gauge; and about 3900 miles on the cheap
3ft. 6in. gauge adopted by Queensland and
Westralia, and latterly by S.A. These are the
State railways. Westralia has all its private
lines on the 3ft. 6in. basis. The private lines
of S.A. are partly 3ft. 6in. and partly sft. 3in.
Of the four private lines of N.S.W., one is
sft. 3in. gauge ; one is 3ft. 6in. ; and two are
4ft. Bgin. All which diversities seem expressly
calculated to prevent one province assisting
another with troops or anything else in case of
that emergency which we hear about so often,
and to make the proposed Federal army prac-
tically useless. If an enemy turned up at
Brisbane, say, the reinforcements from Victoria
would be stranded at Albury until N.S.W.
could get rolling-stock accumulated to carry
them through, and as the N.S.W. rolling-stock
would probably be busy rushing that province’s
own reinforcements to the Q. border, the
chances are that the Vic. soldiers would be
left stranded at Albury indefinitely. Then,
when they did get through, they and the
N.S.W. men would be wrecked at Wal-
langarra until Queensland could find carri-
ages and locomotives to bring them along the
rest of the way, and as a lot of its rolling-
stock would probably be in the hands of
the enemy, and the supply is rather scarce at
all times, the probabilities are the troops would
have to walk the 232 miles to Brisbane, and by
the time they got there the enemy would have
left and would be busy sacking Melbourne and
annexing all the preference shares in the recon-
structed banks. The break of gauge is a great
institution even now, but Australia will never
quite realise how great it is until some event
like this comes to pass, and its army is stranded
at wayside stations all over the continent, and
its commissariat is aground at a dozen separate
junctions, and its ammunition blows up while
being constantly shifted from one series of
trucks to another, and chaos sets in generally.
A Very Old Case.
The case of Mrs. Kilpatrick v. Hdddart,
Parker and Co. is still progressing gradually
in Melbourne. Plaintiff’s husband was drowned
in 1893 by the foundering of the more-or-less-
coffin-ship Alert. Mrs. Kilpatrick sued the
owners for damages on the ground that they
sent out their craft in an unseaworthy condi-
tion, and that her husband lost his life and she
and her child were deprived of their bread-
winner through gross neglect or greed or
callous indifference, or something of the sort.
She got a verdict for £6OO. Then the shipping
firm moved for a new trial, and it was allowed,
and after months of sickening delay.the new
trial came off, and again Mrs. Kilpatrick won,
the verdict this time being ,£791. Next, the
firm appealed to the Full Court, and the case
was argued a third time last February, and
judgment was reserved. Now' the Full Court
has announced that it really can’t make up
its mind, and has ordered that a still fuller
Court, consisting of all the Judges save the one
engaged in the original trial, shall hear the dis-
mal case all over again and consider it some
more. The Court has now been wrestling with
this case off and on for two years. It has accu-
mulated such a stupendous bill of costs that
even if it is finally decided that the widow
Kilpatrick has suffered a grievous wrong, and
she is ordered to receive her £791, she won’t
get a farthing—it will all go in paying her
share of the costs, and probably her furniture
and her other possessions will go as well. If
the case is decided against her, she will also be
ruined by costs —in fact, she will be ruined by
costs either way. The relief the law professes
to give her is a mockery. She has won two
cases ; she has got two verdicts ; and simply
because the defendants are rich, and are able to
prosecute one appeal after another, she hasn’t
got, and never will get, a farthing. If she
had lost her case at the first trial she
couldn’t have appealed for want of money
to pay costs, therefore the wealthy litigant
has four chances against the poor litigant’s
one —saying nothing of the fact that there is
still the Privy Council to appeal to, making a
fifth chance in favor of the men with money.
A good deal might be said about the ghastly
meanness of the shipping firm which uses its
wealth to swamp a widow and an orphan with
law-costs, as well as about the legal system
which allows it to do so. But the interesting
feature just now is the self-acknowledged
ignorance and incompetence of the highly-paid
judiciary, which is responsible for this latest
delay and this last outbreak of costs. The Vic.
bench has heard the story of the lost Alert
three times in all its exhaustive detail, and it
simply states now that it is so dense or so weak
and vacillating that it must hear it all over
again at vast expense before it can come to a
conclusion, and it doesn’t promise to come to a
conclusion even then. The court is paid by
the people to decide such matters on the
evidence ; if it can’t decide when it has heard
the evidence, then it should be sacked for
incompetence. If a £791 case has to be yelled
into the court’s ear four times, at a cost
of about £5OO a time, before the court can
hear it, then it doesn’t matter a straw how
mathematically accurate the final decision is; if a
just verdict for £791 costs £lOOO or £2oo* > to get,
then it would have been better to have got an
unjust one at a cost of £5O. The much-vaunted
purity of the Bench isn’t the thing it is cracked
up to be. A venal Bench which took a <£loo
bribe from the ricli litigant and definitely threw
out the poor litigant on her back hair at her
first appearance, and before the costs had time
to accumulate, would be a lot cheaper than the
present kind, and would give the poor litigant
quite as good a chance as he or she now has—
which is no chance at all.
Mildura.
Chaffey Bros. (Ltd.), the famous Mildura irri-
gation concern, has now reached the awful-
disclosure stage, and the reason for the collapse
becomes fully apparent. Chaffey Bros, got
their irrigation concession from the Victorian
Government. Then they floated it into a co.
and took £200,000 worth of paid up shares and
<£2500 cash for their “interest.” The public
could only be persuaded to take £44,770 worth
of shares, so, as the Chaffevs apparently put
no money into the co., this £44,770 was all the
capital at the back of the stupendous enter-
prise. Then money was raised by selling
£114,900 of 5 per cent, debentures, but as
<£23,395 went in flotation expenses, commission,
brokerage or boodle, tiieco. was really paying
£6 13s. 4d. per cent, for the cash it actually re-
ceived. In addition, £57,000 worth of deben-
tures were issued and pawned to satisfy credi-
tors. The co. sold its land to settlers on time-
payment and took their mortgages for the
balances owing. It pawned the mortgages in
various lots to five banks, one life assurance
society, and 13 private firms, for money
to go on with. Then it pawned its unsold
land to three banks and six private firms.
It gave the guarantee of a prominent director
for £50,000 to four banks. It pawned its
machinery. It also put its bonds “up the
spout ” with two banks, one insurance society,
and three private creditors ; and finally it gave
second mortgages and pawned its immortal
soul, till it bust up for good. The co., with its
great dead-w'eight of British finance on its head,
was practically born dead. Mildura started
simply on the child-like faith of the Australian
in the English capitalist—-who, as often as not,
hasn’t any capital. Having neither capital nor
credit behind it, it worked from the beginning
on money borrowed at rates which no enter-
prise could stand. The borrowed money mostly
went in paying the expenses incurred in bor-
rowing itself, and in paying interest on itself
during the year or two that had to elapse before
Mildura began to make any returns worth men-
tioning. Then it was necessary to float another
loan to pay interest on the first loan, and a third
loan to pay interest on the first two, and so on
till the thirty-second loan or thereabouts was
floated to pay interest on the other thirty-one or
thereabouts. Some of the loans cost, it would
seem, as much as 9 per cent. The co. purports
to owe or to have paid one director £16,731 for
guaranteeing payment of its debts, said guaran-
teed debts now amounting to £50,000. It also
purports to owe him £3472 for services rendered
and £16,131 for interest. Out of the alleged
paid-up capital of £474,770, only £44,770
appears to have ever been paid in cash. There
is no money left, and no assets that are not in
pawn, and no one knows “ where ’e are.” Like
the Maoriland Midland Bail way Co., the Mil-
dura concern has been a ghastly, unspeakable
muddle and a monument of incapacity from
beginning to end ; and of all the financial mud-
dles which Australia has produced in the last
ten years—the Davies companies, the Mercan-
tile, Federal and City of Melbourne banks, the
Commercial of S.A., the Premier Building
Society, and the busted land co’s all included —
there are none that have equalled this pair of
enterprises in their monumental failure. If the
Australian can keep on believing in the sagacity
of the foreign capitalist after these two exam-
ples, his faith must be very enduring indeed.
The Brisbane Eight-Hours’ Demonstration com-
mittee should be content with a very mild
“crow” over the Lamington cheque episode.
They simply laid themselves down in the young
man’s way, and, mistaking them for political
reptiles, he superciliously walked over them.
Why did the committee start the unsavory
business by tapping the Governor for a cheque,
in the first instance ? He was an utter stranger
to Queensland and Australian parties generally.
As soon as he or his like lands on Australian
soil, every creeping organisation endeavors to
capture him as patron, bottle-holder, or cash-
dispenser, and it is only natural that in some
cases he should fail to distinguish the good
from the bad among such a swarm of
prostrate beggars. Gov. Lamington, in effect,
put his case" this way, and the incident,
instead of inspiring the committee to play the
role of indignant Roman fathers, should im-
press upon them the propriety, if in similar
circumstances they make up their minds to
beg again, of first calling upon the new poten-
tate and explaining to him in well-turned
language that they are crawlers of a wholly
innocuous type, politically and socially, and
that, so far from meaning disrespect to Consti-
tution or Throne, they will give him guarantees
that his cheque shall be spent in soft drinks,
colored banners, and crying “Hurrah !”
Melbourne Reform Club, an institution of fat
men and political economists of an obsolete but
malignant type, will be careful before it again
invites Rev. Reginald Stephen to lecture to it
on “Freedom of Contract.” The members sat
in puzzled horror the other night while he told
them that absolute freedom of contract was
neither desirable nor admirable, and that every
civilised state had recognised the fact. Free-
dom, they were informed, was not the end, but
only a means to an end, and wherever it did
not conduce to the general good, it was wise to
limit it. He claimed that society had the right
to fix limitations to freedom of contract in in-
dustrial relations :
(1) As to the conditions under which the work should
be done, as with the Factories Act. [Fancy the wincing of
the Argus as it recorded this. ]
(2) As to the rate of wages to be paid.
(3) As to the qualification of the laborer for the work.
Of course, by this time Fatmanity was getting
ropeable, and the rev. lecturer pityingly threw
a little sop in the shape of a mild disapproval
of the Queensland shearers’ strike.
The Coffin-Ship.
Do you think that the crew would go to sea without
making any complaint? —Yes, they would have to go for
the sake of their wives and children ; in order to get
bread, men have to put up with a good deal nowadays.—
Evidence , re the unseaworthiness of ships generally,
given before a board of inquiry in Melbourne the other
day.
She may be an iron cullender, an’ cranky as a
rack,
With rotten decks an’ rotten plates, or rotten
in the bulk,
But we’ve got to take her out, my lads ; we’ll
maybe bring her back
If our luck is not ez rotten ez this God-for-
saken hulk.
For the kiddies must be fed,
An’ the missus have a bed,
An’ have clothes to hide her bones, my lads—a
roof to hide her head.
We who man the good old coffin-ship have need
of marrer bones,
An’ good cause to bear in mind the bloomin’
mission covies’ tex ;
There’s a flake ’r two o’ rust between our souls
an’ Davy Jones,
An’ a tidy swag o’ cargo gaily swung around
our necks.
When we’re bobbin’ on the seas,
We pray God to hold His breeze,
An’ our teeth begin to rattle when we hear a
squeaker sneeze.
When we swing her out, an’hearken to the
lau’sman’s kindly wishes,
Ho ! it’s so-long to the missus, an’ it’s good-
by, mar an’ par,
Ez we’re proberly a-steamin’ out to picnic with
the fishes
On a pile o’ perished iron, when it ain’t a blob
o’ tar.
If she lives to agonize
’Tween the water an’ the skies
’Till we make a port, we’ll take it ez another
glad surprise.
Sun and moon shine through her scurvy decks,
her venterlation’s fair,
For she gapes in fifty places when she rises
to the swell.
When the sea gets up an’ hits her, then we wait
to feel her tear,
An’ we wish the crimson owners was a-board
to hear her yell.
Yes, we wish them swells was aft
On their crazy, leakin’ craft,
With a ragin’ sea before her, an’ a rousin’ squall
abaft.
All her boilers spit an’ hiss an’ spirt—they’re
cankered up with rust
But we’ve got to make a livin’, an’ that ain’t
concernin’ us.
We go downward if she breaks, my lads, or
up’ards if they bust —
The direction doesn’t matter, an’ we mustn’t
make a fuss.
For the kiddies must be fed,
An’ the missus have a bed,
An’ have clothes to hide her bones, my lads —a
roof to hide her head.

The promised ensuement of “Thorough-
bred ’ ’ at Sydney Cri. proved to be, on the whole,
an unsatisfying circumstance. Lumley’s farce has
no recognised centre. It is suggestive of a long
word with the accent nowhere, or a story where
everybody or nobody is the hero, or the two ends
of anything with the middle left out. There
is a lot of amusing incident in it, but there is no
central incident in particular. Either the play is
mainly about the trouble Brough gets into as a
pious man with a surreptitious racehorse, or the
difficulty Boucicault has in making love coherently
to Miss Katherine Hardy, or Miss Ea.ber’s reluct-
ance to marry Titheradge because he is an Ameri-
can, or Dorrington’s fatuous aspect as a poet, or
something else. “ Thoroughbred ” contains a good
many amusing points, but the points are mostly
as disconnected as an early Christian in the Coli-
seum. The dialogue is smart, and, as almost all
the characters are the leading character and every
character is running on his own detached hook,
the co. shows out very well. Titheradge’s
Amurrikan is a fine piece of subdued humor,
and when he mixes the great national cocktail
and gives up trying to be English, the soul of the
audience goes out to him unanimously. Bouci-
cault’s festive youth and Brough’s henpecked mil-
lionaire are both excellent characters, and Dor-
rington, as a slow, long-haired bard, blooms into
unexpected brilliance. Miss Faber produces good
results out of no materials in particular, except a
pair of bright eyes and a general permission from
the author to hang round, and Miss Hardy does
likewise. A promiscuous song-and-dance enter-
tainment shows the co. in an altogether new
light, and suggests that Boucicault and Miss
Temple are a woeful loss to the variety-stage ; and
when Miss Watt-Tanner grovels bulkily at the
feet of her outraged husband, she presents the
broken-hearted girl of melodrama in a novel and
improved, as well as enlarged, aspect. All that
there is in “Thoroughbred,” however, is due to
the company. There isn’t enough comedy to hold
the people together, and, with a worse company,
it would begin to be doubtful if there was any
comedy at all.
*# * *
The great police horror is having a night
out at Her Majesty’s. “In the Queen’s Name ”
is a furious rush and stampede of policemen from
beginning to end. It opens with eight policemen
standing in a row, and it closes with Miss Lilia
Wilde fiercely shaking a dead policeman and pour-
ing shrill vituperations into the ear which will
never again be opened to receive information. In
between these two episodes the feet of many
policemen pound incessantly on the rotten stair,
and the voice of the innumerable cop demands
that the decaying door shall be opened in the
name of the law ; and the red visage of the flabber-
gasted bobby looks out of every window and sees
the assassin escaping over the house-tops ; and the
sad, sympathetic blue-bottle won’t let the weeping
wife come in and see her husband hanged ; and the
stolid, stony trap does sentry-go on the gallows,
and the peeler is on the full jump everywhere.
“In the Queen’s Name ” isn’t a new drama ;
it is only the old “ Secrets of the Police,”
or something to that effect, disguised and
with variations. Miss Lilia Wilde is practically
the whole show —or, rather, all that part of it which
isn’t merely the rush of infuriated constable. She is
partly larrikiness, partly handsome she-fiend, partly
affectionate fish-fag, and partly gutta-percha
costermonger, mixed with Topsy and various
other things. She does more rushing and jump-
ing than all the rest of the co. put together ; she
keeps up her end of a rousing fight with the vigor
of a bushel of wild cats arid floors the enemy
twice ; she knocks sundry policemen out of shape
at an emergency—in short, Miss Wilde holds the
drama together and whoops it along all the time,
and yet manages to make the wild-cat heroine a
rather picturesque and loveable character when
she isn’t blackening the eye of the force or shaking
the defunct constable. Alfred Woods is principally
occupied in being hanged. Robert Inman devotes
himself mainly to the crawlsome variety of wicked-
ness. Johnson Weir has good points as the father
policeman who is “shook” after death ; and Harry
Leston is an all-pervading individual who does
fearsome gymnastics in escaping from the police.
As a whole, the drama may be summed up as a
large, raw, red horror which goes at a gallop all
through, and gives more incident and gallows
and hurried policeman to the sq uare inch than is
usual. Miss Wilde’s fight with the villain is especi-
ally recommended as an example to any lady who
meets a burglar in the night, and every lady should
see it that she may know how to tackle the burglar
in a large and vigorous spirit. The fact that
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” with a new minstrel
element in it, ensues next Saturday is a circum-
stance that is too sad to be dwelt upon.
** * *
“ Saved From the Sea,” staged at Sydney
Royal on Saturday, is a melodrama which makes
The Bulletin feel sad right through. There are
many hunky bad men in it, and the property goes
to the nearest villain as it always does when the
rich man dies, and everything is exactly as it is in
every other melodrama. Baker, as the hero, is
saved from a rather badly-managed sea of raging
green calico, under complicated circumstances,
but this fact has no particular connection with the
story. Afterwards the law proceeds to hang
Baker on deficient evidence, but the trap won’t
work, and he is reprieved and sent to the old
stone-breaking yard at Portland to chip at the
same big block of stone which Rignold and Cates
and Augustus Glover and dozens of other stage
personages have tackled and given up as a bad
job. The stone-breaking scene has become a
misery and a weariness, and besides everybody
knows that the convict will presently escape
on the prompt side —the convict always escapes
on the prompt side. And it is equally a
matter of course that he will find the man who
can explain everything chipping at the other big
block of stone, because that person is always peg-
ging away mechanically at the other block. A
broken bridge, and a dead man sitting up in an
easy chair, and an explosion, and one or two other
trifles help to eke out the narrative, which doesn’t
end but only falls down dead in the presence of a
hay-waggon at the conclusion of Act IV. It
leaves the hero being hauled from his weeping
wife back to the stone-breaking job, but it is
vaguely assumed that he will be set free by-and-
bye because one of the conspirators has stated his
innocence to a policeman and then collapsed from
old age and gunshot before he had time to back up
his story with any details, or to attest it on oath,
or have it put in writing, or to explain coherently
why the other man really did the crime. It is
also assumed that the hero’s wife will get her
fortune from the other conspirator if he hasn’t
spent it all, because the same convict states to the
policeman, at the back of the hay-waggon and in
the presence of Bland Holt’s ruined hat, which
Mr. Bland has just jumped upon, that it
is really hers, but doesn’t even explain
which fortune it is. In short, the story has
all the beautiful consecutiveness of the romance
which the small boy laboriously composes in his
exercise-book and writes in a large hand with his
tongue out. Its best points are Baker’s fine act-
ing as the improbable hero, and the good work
done by Charles Brown and Miss Flora Anstead,
and the whole-souled manner in which Mrs. Bland
bounds on Bland’s hat—no other lady that The
Bulletin remembers ever bounded on a hat with
such airy abandon before or bounded so high.
Also, Miss Watson developes a lot of tragic inten-
sity, and promises rather better than she did, and
a very, very small boy named Smith does a piece
of child-acting which is far above the average.
* * * -*
Miss Myra Kemble’s benefit, dimly fore-
shadowed last week, takes place to-day (Thursday)
at the Lyceum. The “Firm’s” co. contributes
the most gorgeous act of ‘ ‘ Djin-Djin ” ; the B. and
B. co. gives one act of ‘ ‘ Thoroughbred ” ; and the
go’s from Her Majesty’s, the Royal, and the
Tivoli give an act each, after the scrappy fashion
of benefits in general. Miss Kemble, at one time
the favorite par excellence of Australian playgoers,
is now ill with a complication of complaints,
including partial paralysis, and her recovery is
practically hopeless. She has necessarily left for
good the stage of which she used to be such an
ornament, and in various other ways fortune has
deserted her. Therefore, the great heart of the
Australian people, which sent so many flowers to
Parkes after he was dead, is hereby invited to do
something large and really handsome for Myra
Kemble while she is yet alive and able to appre-
ciate it. The habit of waiting till an old friend
has gone and then sending a flower after him is
shiftless and unpractical, anyhow.
# * * *
“Djin-Djin” is nearing the end of its
career at Sydney Lyceum, and the patter of
Trilby’s snowy feet can be heard in the distance, a
week or two away. The date of the Jap.-Bogie-
Man’s decease is fixed for Friday week, and
Svengali’s shock of greasy mane is due on Satur-
day (16th).
# * * *
Miss Alice Leamar is again doing her last
week at Sydney Tivoli, and so are the Lenton
Bros., the Crossley Sisters, and ventriloquist
Winton, and the great ’Arry Rickards himself;
and the gap that all these people leave is to be
filled in by Charles Godfrey, who starts on Satur-
day. Charles has a very large opening in front of
him.
* * * *
Fitzgeralds’ Circus opens at Sydney in all
its glory this (Thursday) evening, and it is gener-
ally reported that Solomon the Magnificent would
have dropped down dead on his ivory throne if he
had seen it. The Bulletin hopes to expand into
much loose eloquence on the subject next week.
* * * *
W. and M., in all probability, pass fewer
‘ ‘ dead-heads ” into their shows than any other
theatrical management on earth. The late Henry
Sampson, of London Referee, said something to
this effect after visiting M elb. Royal, during the
“ Firm’s ” regime, when he learned to his astonish-
ment that nearly everybody in the house had paid
for admission. The dead head record for Sarah
Bernhardt’s first appearance at the Princess’s must
have been unique. Many pressmen, “on the
door,” but not on the job as notice-writers, stayed
away from the great event under an impression
that they wouldn’t be admitted, and when the
curtain rose there were not more than half-a-dozen
stiff ’uns standing at the back of the dress-circle.
The writer, who was one of them, blushes at the
recollection.
* * * *
“Sons of Erin,” a new melodrama with
an original miracle in it, has replaced “ The Work
Girl ” at Melbourne Royal. The change of bill
is an improvement generally. “ Sons of Erin” is
just sufficiently Irish to admit of a colleen dance
and numerous wild hooroos by a vartuous pisantry,
also the villain steals a long-lost “ pardon,” which
should have restored the ould estates to a
withered branch of the Corrigan family, but after
a while the drama breaks away from Ballybeg
Castle and settles .down amidst the ’Merkan Civil

*** . * ,
The Bulletin has some feeling of respect
for “ Sons of Erin,” on account of its reckless
character, clever scenery, and hearty marmer
introducing itself to notice. Theactig
to only one objection, which couldn * avoide
by the players. They all do something that theji
did a fortnight earlier m The Enemy sCamp,
although their conduct on this occasion shows
more regard for common sense. Hans P ’
Frank Harcourt, and C. R. Stanford make them-
selves useful to the people already mentioned, and
Westmacott comes in late as a Yankee telegraph
operator, with cheerful results. As regards the
thunderbolt that whizzes across the chasm, it is
manifestly guided by the hand of Providence in
answer to the hero’s prayer. Therefore, N.S.W.
can depend upon Scot Inglis to burst up the n 3
drought with a few well-chosen words. As a
petitioner at the Throne of Grace he is much more
reliable than the Church, and his supplication is
far less snufflesome.
** * *
The Alexandra offers a revival of “First
Class,” wherein Dan Barry tames the spirit of his
ragged daughter by locking her in a dark cel ar,
to be chased by the rats. Dan is a partially-
clothed miser in the burglary trade, and the ettect
of the limelight gleaming down upon his eyeballs
and bare chest is impressive. He gets no apparent
benefit by his crimes, except the right to revel m
dirt and seclusion from the police, nevertheless he
goes on finding money for the gang, and the gang
flourishes for three hours at his expense. It he
didn’t drag his daughter round the premises by
her hair, Daniel might pass for a philanthropist.
Collett Dobson is the Roman-faced schemer who
always travels first-class until the police intervene,
and Miss Duggan shrieks earnestly among the
rats. The rest of this favorite Haleckian drama
is chiefly performed by Augustus Glover and a
confiding mother, who entrusts a friend by the
name of Nosey with half-a-sovereign, and waits
patiently for the change, which never returns.
** * *
“Trilby ” is now within a week of its
finish at Melb. Princess’s, but ere Svengali and
his song-bird depart for Sydney, The Bulletin
may as well mention a point in the first act which
would admit of more emphasis. It is Trilby’s re-
mark that Litolf, the composer, was struck by her
wonderful voice. Svengali expresses the impor-
tance of this statement by rising from the piano
and stopping the girl’s chatter, but the audience
doesn’t fully grip the situation, inasmuch as
Trilby’s words have almost escaped notice. If she
spoke them more incisively, rang them out with
some energy in the middle of a dead silence, the
house would understand that Svengali had
suddenly conceived a great scheme. Here,
as in other places, the performance seems to take
a universal acquaintance with the novel for
granted, instead of remembering that not 15 per
cent, of the audience is likely to know where the
germ of the tragedy is concealed. When Trilby
quotes Litolf she settles her fate. She gives the
Hebrew his hypnotic cue. She certainly ought to
give it for all it is worth.
** * *
Will Crackles, the latest London addition
to the Rickards Co., makes his first appear-
ance at Melb. Opera House to-night. Ken-
nedy (who happily got delayed awhile upon
the ocean) is appearing at the Athenaeum
for a limited season, which can’t be too
much curtailed, and Rev. Charles Clarke, an
entertainer of a very different color, will start his
limited season at the Town Hall next Saturday.
Nothing could be too nice to say of Charles Clarke’s
lectures, but the sweet things have been so often
said in this journal, where parsons, as a rule, are
not unduly worshipped, that a repetition of pre-
vious compliments must be taken as read in the
meantime. On the same evening the Newbury-
Spada Concert Co. will give tongue at the Exhibi-
tion, so Melbourne seems in a fair way to get more
extra shows than the city can carry.
** * *
“Cheer, Boys, Cheer,” the huge spec-
tacular drama with which George Rignold expects
to knock Australia, will be first produced here at
Melbourne Royal in August. This will give the
country three months of steady preparation for
the shock.
At Poverty Point .
Madame Cooke, a sister of the famous Madame Celeste
and herself a one-time leading actress and manageress in
Australia, is a resident of Sydney. She is the oldest-
record actress on the continent. Over 80 years of ace
she yet has no need of Spectacles, and writes as firm a
hand as an ordinary commercial man. ’Twas Madame
Cooke who brought Lola Montez to Australia. She is
best known by her “Comic History of Australia,” pub
lished many years ago. i u
Someone in Melb. tries to incite the beauteon«
bountifully-busted Edith Crane to appear in a Shatof
speanan character at Melb. Princess’s ere she departs and
suggests that the character should be Rosalind If thp
object were to have a look at Edith’s legs-which should
be revelations of substantial beauty-in tights, the sus
gestion would be good. The Herald correspondent ev i
dently labors under the impression that Edith is a great
actress , but people go to the theatre to look at Edith
Crane not to see her act. As Bernard Shaw says of Mrs.
St Campbell, “ she is,” and that is enough.
rwiish music-hall artistes clamor against Australian
halhsts singing their copyright songs. A newcomer from
-Ome must be content, on landing here, to sing old stuff,
nreviouslv done to death by imitators-unless he or she
his brought from London a grip-sack full of original songs
Ind sketches Two of Rickards’ importations (now on
the water) estimate that it has cost them £lOO to prepare
new business, which takes gilt off the gingerbread!
Re Australian playwrights : A Sydney manager, “ one
of the best,” says he has read, within the last couple of
years 55 “ new and original” dramas by local authors,
not one of which has been even possible of Production,
and the majority bordered on the ludicrous One (“ pat-
hetic”) play submitted was in 20 scenes, each scene being
laid in a different country. This was wntten by a well-
known alleged literary man, yet a crucial point of the
drama was the appearance of a lion and a kangaroo on the
banks of a’ river in France !
Unprejudiced testimony to Williamson’s powers as a
comedian came from some pressmen at a Melb. Royal
matinee some years ago. It was a show in aid of a
charity -the Dramatic Fund, perhaps and all the avail-
able big people were gathered in a performance of Trial
bv Jury ” The pressmen, who came late and couldn t
find a programme, recognised every notable member of
the crowd with the one exception of the judge, and his
Honor, they reckoned, was getting more humor (unob-
trusively) out of his character than any of them. The
judge turned out to be J. C. Williamson. He had been
casually criticised as an unknown actor, and classed in
the A 1 division.
Reuben Fax gets no “ butter” from minor members of
the “ Trilby ” Co. when verdant interviewers seek their
opinions as to the best artiste in the crowd. One thinks
Gecko is unsurpassable, another is lost in admiration of
Zou Zou. But the public vote for Fax, because his per-
formance is something they can swear by. Being re-
quired to hold the audience, he does it.
The much-execrated Little Billee at Melb. Princess s
serves one useful purpose, since he reconciles the people
to the death of Trilby in the fourth act. It is felt that the
end of the handsome heroine is very sad, but of two evils
death is far and away the smaller. Death is happiness
itself compared to the calamity of long life with Little
Billee-goat.
Dan Barry has introduced a family of trick bicyclists
into “ Uncie Tom’s Cabin.” “ Why don’t you put the
angels on bicycles in the apotheosis of Little Eva ? ” some-
body asked Daniel. “ Not a bad idea at answered
the manager, soberly. “By Jove ! I’ll see if we can’t
work it.” Manager Barry is the sort of man who, if called
upon to represent the golden streets of Elysium, would
want to drag in a steam-roller.
Connoisseurs declare La Belle Maie to be the prettiest
and shapeliest little woman seen on the Melbourne music-
hall stage within the memory of the baldest head. She
has ’em all on a wire.
Edith Crane, as Trilby, reminds the Melb. people of
somebody they remember well, and yet they can’t think
of the other woman’s name. Sarah Bernhardt it is. Crane
has cultivated a Sarah-like appearance about the eyes and
hair, very noticeable in some of her photos.
Miss Sylvia Madden, daughter of the Vic. Chief Justice,
has about the best nerve of any unprofessional warbler in
Melbourne. The attractive damsel, who sings intelli-
gently, makes her rather hard soprano go for twice as
much as the ordinary amateur organ of its class is worth
on a public platform. The same might be said of her
papa’s oratory. “ What is face-value ? ” asked a truculent
cross-examiner in court, the other day. “ Cheek,” replied
his learned friend.
“ Cheer, Boys, Cheer,” one of the plays which George
ftignold brings back to Australia after his three months’
English trip, deals chiefly with the Jameson raid.
The refusal of the Engiish Examiner of Plays to
license “Joseph of Canaan” G.R. thinks hardly consis-
tent ; for “ The Sign of the Cross,” which flings sacred
texts about vigorously, is going well in London, and is
attracting highly-devout audiences, who pray into their
hats during the intermission instead of going out to post
important letters.
On the departure, a few weeks ago, of a Sydney Wes-
leyan minister from his circuit, the members of a literary
society in connection with the church gave a farewell
picnic to his sons. The affair was very slow, so, by way
of compensation, a number of the hosts and hostesses
wound up the day by a visit to Harry Rickards’ Tivoli !
Some of Arthur Garner’s prospective “ New Music-
Hall ” engagements for Tatt. Adams : Cinquevalli (who
balances two billiard-balls on the point of a cue), Lottie
Collins, Herbert Campbell, the Grigolatis (the flying
troupe), and Brown and Newlands, who were out here
some years ago. Garner’s instructions practically read,
“ Carte blanche as regards salaries, only get the best.”
The tuneful and shapely Miss Florence Esdaile last week
became Mrs. George Pack.
Fax has the courage actually to look dirty, on the
stage.
Majeroni is the Svengali understudy, and haunts the
side-scenes, as Frank Thornton did when he waited in
vain for Grossmith’s boots, throughout the 300 nights of
“ lolanthe.” Frank would come to George of a morning
with “My dear fellow, you don’t look at all well. Allow
me to recommend a pill.” “ No, thank ye,” said G.
Ras Magnussen, well known in both theatrical and
journalistic circles, is to be benefltted at Sydney Opera
House next Tuesday, 12th.
Manager Westmacott, of Melb. T.R., may retire from
management after his Melb. season and join forces with
George Rignold. At present he has most of George’s co.,
and the latter would be in a hole for mummers if West-
macott kept on.
Rignold brings with him from London a good many
plays, including “ Cheer, Boys, Cheer,” with which he
will in all probability open in Melbourne in August; and
“ Tommy Atkins,” which, although a frost at the West
End, is going great guns in the East. There is plenty of
good stuff in “ Tommy Atkins,*” which no doubt .the great
Henry V. will bring out. It is a rattling, rollicking sort
of play, and with the Jingo spirit rampant in the city of
snivelling and imposture it is bound to go down well.
Rignold has also up his sleeve a new play by Arthur Shir-
ley, one or two comedies, and a few other things.
The best photo, of the much-photographed
Parkes was the last, or very nearly the last, which
the veteran had taken. It was reproduced in last
week’s Bulletin, and was by Falk, of Sydney.
The excellence of the reproduction was almost
due to the artistic finish of Falk’s original,
which depicted an idealised Parkes—the Parkes
that was with the Parkes that might have been
looking out from his faded eyes and vaguely assert-
mg himself in the background.

The A.M.P. Society’s report for 1895 is, on the
whole, a satisfactory document, though the effects of the
depression are manifest in many places. The renewal
premiums (£1,178,144) are £12,000 more than last year
and £20,000 more than in ’93. New premiums (£99 075)
are £BO.lO more than in ’94, and £2OOO more than in ’93
Also they are £26,000 less than in 1890. Interest on
investments ( 694,903) is £4OOO less than last year, despite
the fact that the funds have increased by £727,000 and
only £36,000 more than in ’93, when the funds were
£1,200,000 smaller. Total income (£2,009,843), however
shows an improvement of £39,090 over 1894, ami it is
noteworthy tnat ’95 is the first occasion w'hen the vear’s
receipts have got over the two-million level With a
much larger business the death and endowment claims
(£623,091) are only £167 more than in 18.14 ; exp uses
(8.37 per cent.) are practically the same ; and the funds
now amount to the magnificent total of £13,162,612.
The balance-sheet is, in most respects; a model of com-
pleteness. It sets forth separately interest in arrears,
interest due but within the days of grace (both of which
items are very moderate), interest accrued but net due,
properties acquired by foreclosure, office properties in
each province, premiums due and premiums overdue.
One feature is that properties foreclosed now represent
£538,454, nearly £200,000 more than last year, and
£350,000 more than two years ago. This looks as if a
good many of the society’s borrowers had lately been
getting into difficulties. It is a pity that rent is not re-
turned separately, as it was in 1890, so that the public
could judge if these foreclosed properties are good value
for the £538,434 set against them.
Surrenders this year amount to no less than
£375,283—£4500 more than in ’94, and £72,000 more than
in ’93. Interest has fallen from £5 13s. 6d. per cent, in
’93, and £5 11s. lOd. in ’94, to £5 ss. 2d. In consequence
of this and other causes, the surplus (£476,465) is fully
£200,000 less than that of ’94. The bonus will be about the
same, but this result is arrived at by adding only £16,000
to the reserve for depreciation, whereas the amount added
last year was £225,000. On the other hand, the A.M. I>. has
now reduced its assumed future rate of interest to £3 12s.
6d. per cent, in place of the former 4 per cent., and, when
it gets it down to 3) per cent, a year hence, a great piece of
work will have been completed, and thereafter bonuses
should improve. Taking it all round, the present result
is quite as satisfactory as could be expected.
* * * *
The report of the National Bank of Australasia
for the half-year ended 31st March, ’96 (which appears on
the inside of front cover in this issue) is another down-
ward-looking document. The net profit is £10,523, w'h ; ch
compares badly with the £13,762 earned for six months
ended Sept., 1895 ; £15,125 for half ended March, ’95 ;
£25,231 for half ended Sept.,’94 ; and £31,312 at March,
’94. The National stands on a very different basis from
some of its rivals, seeing that it has regularly paid 5 per
cent, dividends to its preference shareholders and has
honorably met the 4£ per cent, interest on its recon-
structed deposits and still shown a balance to the good ;
nevertheless, the fact remains that its earnings have
growm less and less every half-year since the reconstruc-
tion. The usual 5 per cent. div. on preference shares
absorbs £7644, leaving only £2879 to carry to profit
and loss, making the whole amount accumulated in
three years £12,436. As it would take £39,000 to
pay a half - year’s div. at 5 per cent, on ordinary
capital, and the National is £36,000 short of that
sum, the prospects of the ordinary shareholders look
pretty bleak. Moreover, the last of the reserve-fund
(£100,000) has now been written off to cover losses ; and
with no reserve, a fast-declining revenue, and a n et profit of
less than Us. 4d. per cent, on capital, the National’s con-
duct in fooling away £7644 in a div. to preference share-
holders looks wholly unwarranted. If the bank has made
£10,523 on one hand and has lost £lOO,OOO on the other,
there is no legitimate profit out of which to pay
dividends.
The National is now paying off about =£1. 000, 000
of its old 4*4 per cent, deposits, and the saving in interest
—if not swallowed up by another downward movement in
the profits—should make things look very much better next
half-year. The new deposits have increased during the
six months by nearly half-a-million, the cash on hand and
note circulation have improved, and everything shows an
improvement—except the profits. Considering that the
cash on hand is close on £2,000,000 and the liquid securities
are £1,140,000 more, the National could afford to take the
bull by the horns and release the remainder of its old
deposits in one act. It could get quite as many of them
back as it has any use for at 3 or 3j per cent., and it would
thereby save at the very least £50,000 a year in interest,
which it badly wants just now. After that, it should adopt
the wise policy followed by the Royal of Queensland, and
make it a hard-and-fast law that one-fourth of its profits
shall go to a reserve, and that the reserve shall be
separately invested in Govt, securities, and then the
National may expect to be a great and prosperous institu-
tion again—some day.
The old depositors, at all events, have done re-
markably well out of the National. Part of their money
was converted into preference shares, which have received
5 per cent, regularly, and the stipulated 4)4 per cent, has
been paid on the balance, so that they are really getting
£4 Us. per cent, all round. The preference share idea
was good enough for the Commercial and Colonial, but
for the National it was a woefully bad spec.

According to the liquidators’ report, the col-
lapsed Mildura Co. owes the Colonial Mutual Life Assur-
ance Society £21,700, money lent on mortgage, and
£10,750 accumulated interest. The society has about
£1,800,000 invested, and its latest balance-sheet sets
forth that “rents and interest outstanding and accrued”
are just £17,705. The amount accrued but not due must
amount to something on so large a mass of securities,
and the rents due and accrued must also amount to some-
thing. Yet if £10,750 interest is owing on one loan,
which represents less than one-thirtieth of the whole
amount advanced on mortgage, it leaves only £7OOO to
Cover everything else. - Is that £17,705 the whole
amount of the rents and interest owing? If it
isn’t, why are the figures presented so as to look
as if it was, and how much more is owing? If it is, how
does the institution contrive to collect its money so
vigorously from all its other creditors that £7OOO covers
all other interest and rents due and accrued ? And is the
Colonial Mutual—and a good many other societies as well
—prepared to make that line read in future balance-
sheets “ All interest and rents due, &e. ” ? In the present
case the loan appears tobe based on reasonably good security
despite the fact that the Mildura Co. seems to be more or
less a personage who is also a director of the Colonial
Mutual, so that gentleman looks as if he had been to some
extent lending the society’s money to himself. But the
real trouble is that the £10,750 said to be due for interest
on one small advance doesn’t look as if it fitted in with
the £17,705 alleged in the balance-sheet to be the whole
amount outstanding on all the advances. If it does fit in,
then the fit is truly wonde-ful.

What is the value of a balance-sheet and an
«rt.floate? Quite recently the Carlton and
west End Breweries Co. (Melb.) issued a balance-sheet set-
ring torth that its properties were worth £672,000; that its
net assets were £1,143,000 and its liabilities £843,000;
leaving a clear surplus of £300,000. Then the Brewery
'"'O' proceeded to liquidate, which seemed quite unac-
countable for such a prosperous concern, and when a
snareholder took legal proceedings to stop these doings
the management filed affidavits to the effect that pro-
P er S> s et down in the balance-sheet at £672,000, was only
worth £312,000; that of £400,000 set down as debts due
7? tbeco. ) £340,000 was believed to be bad ; that out of
£480,000 uncalled capital V 400,000 was irrecoverable ; and
that instead of £300,000 surplus there was £400,000
d TL len f’' Said barrister Topp, the co’s representative :
Ihe plaintiff’s paid-up shares are worth nothing. The
co. is hopelessly insolvent.” The management presum-
ably instructed Topp to say this, and as a certain bank
offers to take 6s. Bd. in the £ in settlement of the co’s
overdraft, it looks as if it was true. But, considering, the
ghastly discrepancy between this statement and the
balance-sheet issued a very few months ago, a good many
people would like to know the management’s explanation.
“ Attorney-General Isaacs; “According to the
affidavits filed by the defendants (the co.) the last, balance-
sheet was a mass of lies from beginning to end.” What
is the exact value of a balance-sheet and an auditor’s
certificate in Australia?

The Vic. butter export-trade is a whole essay on
the natural cussedness of people in general. The mail
companies formerly had a monopoly of the export busi-
ness, and charged high freights which seriously damaged
the trade. When their contract expired they refused to
make any serious reduction on the ground that the old
rates were only just payable, and another co. got the
Government contract. Thereupon the mail co.’s cut their
rates to the new figure, spent large sums on storage
accommodation so as to run against the Governmentstores,
arranged for facilitating advances on butter consigned
through them, and are scrambling madly for a fraction of
the business at a price which they previously declared
wouldn’t pay for the whole of it. The sharks and middle-
men and the Argus are with them, while the Government
and most of the producers back the new contractors, and
it is a very pretty row as things stand.

The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. has made
£85,166 profit for the half-year, and pays the usual div. at
10 per cent, per annum, absorbing £85,059. The most

mechanical regularity with which it turns out almost
exactly the same amount of profit every six months.

The Eagle Tobacco Co. (Sydney) reports a loss

demand at 4s. ; no reserve ; shortage on profit and loss
account, £341.

At Cobar : “ The Mt. Drysdale mine has fallen
off considerably, and shareho'ders are somewhat anxious
as to the cause.” Possibly it is want of gold. They have
tried changing managers —the common practice in N.S.W.
—without effect. Mine poor, manager no good.

The Mt. Aylin prospectus is out. The mine is
in the Nana Creek district (N.S.W.), of which a good
opinion has more than once been here expressed. Capital,
£60,000, in that number of shares; consideration, £6OO,
and half the shares fully paid. J. S. A. Taylor, C.E., M.E.,
says there are upwards of 130,000 tons of crushing stone
in sight, but does not make it clear how he arrives at such
an exposed tonnage. The sizes of five reefs are carefully
set out, but nothing is said re the length of the ore chutes
—a far more important consideration.
The upward movement in British B.H. shares,
though partly due to an English inquiry, arises in great
measure from the spread of opinion that in the fiat
ground on Block 16—the northern block —a big “make” of
sulphides will be found at depth corresponding with the
big “ make ” of oxidised ores on the flat ground of Block
11 (Proprietary Co.). The unexpected striking of the
Junction western chimney of ore has markedly increased
confidence in the northern end of the lode ; and as good
ore has been found both north and south of the British,
there are at least fair reasons for expecting good things
from the depressed ground in that c’aim, although the
outcrop, when it continues after this break, reappears
more to the west on the Junction.
* * * *
Block 10 concentrating plant is doing only fair
work ; it has been found necessary to make an extra-
ordinary number of small alterations and adjustments,
yet there is no reason to expect that the plant will not be
able to profitably treat the ore.
B.H. North, having begun to turn out sulphide
concentrates, is having constructed a tram-line to connect
with the Silverton and South Australian line to the sea-
board. Underground, this mine looks only tolerably
well; no big output of payable ore could be maintained
upon present developments.
Block 14 mill put up a record in the third week
in April : it put through 2721 tons (including purchased
ores), getting 865 tons concentrates “of the usual fair
value ’’-—that is all the information ever conveyed on this
point. Besides that, 219 tons carbonate ore were sent
away.

The latest Broken Hill venture on the market is
the Junction South, to which is tacked an ore-dressing
plant and the rights of the patented process known as the
Banfield. The Junction South is a “ long shot.” It lies
south of the Junction ; but, then, the lode merely elbows
out in the Junction, so far as the workings show, so that
the best hope of the Junction South is the possession of a
semi-detached chimney like the one the J unction is working,
or the underlay of the main lode. But the diamond-drill-
holes on the Brisbane Blocks give little hope of the under-
lay being got at a workable depth in the claims running
along the eastern foot of the hill; while, as for the chances
of getting a semi-detached body, the claim is rather too
far south to benefit by the apparent break-up of the lode
in the British. Still, it is not a wholly hopeless block,
and the sulphide-dressing plant has some good features.

A becoming vein of modesty runs through the

Several of the N. Dandalup (W.A.) gold-finds
were soon found to have been salted, and the revelation
has made some Perth men feel very sick. Amongst those
who jumped most violently on the man who first con-
demned the finds was H. Rhys-Jones, editor of Perth
Mining Journal. In a long interview, Rhys-Jones was
represented as saying that instead of there being no
stone at the claims like that shown in Perth, there were
thousands of tons of it—which was probably true, only
that the thousands of tons had been gilded. The inter-
view wound up with a doubt on the sanity of the
impeacher of the field. Francis Hart, who has gone com-
pany floating to England, must also feel ill when he
remembers how he described one claim, also amongst the
gift, as “ a mountain of gold.”

A prospector writes from Dundas Hills, W.A. :

Kalgoorlie : “ It is expected that the next Kal-
goorlie escort will be the heaviest that has ever left the
town. Considerable feeling is being manifested at the
continued indifference to the request that the yields of the
fields should be given separately. All the gold of the
Kalgoorlie mines is credited to Coolgardie.” Having next
to no gold-record of its own, Coolgardie gets the benefit
of the outlying places. This enrages the Kalgoorlie edi-
tors, who have started to expose the barrenness of the
Coolgardie mines, and to express great sympathy thereat.

Adelaide : ‘ ‘ Several large nuggets from the

foreign capital ?

Coolgardie —“ Tuesday—Shierlaw’s started at

“ The famous Hill End mine at Broad Arrow

The disappointing Golden Zone crushing —less
than an ounce when over three was expected—is causing
some paper-war at Kalgoorlie. Of course it was “ all left

than the blanketings. The battery-manager now comes
along with a tailings assay showing that the extraction
was not so bad after all.

From London to The Bulletin: “The W.A.
market has hardened a little lately, on account of the
good yields and reported strikes in the Great Boulder arid
Lake View; but, at the same time, there does not seem
much life in it, and there is very little real business doing.
They are expecting great things here from the Brown’s
Creek crushing. If that mine should prove good, it will
be a good thing for N.S.W. There are several strong
people talking of doing business in N.S.W., and you may
look for quite a demand for mining properties in your
country before long.”

Government to pass an Act whereby the Korrumburra

should have stimulated Vic. Government to take some

has paid £2812 in dividends during the quarter; it sup-
ports 945 men—an increase of 159 in the past year ; and it

On the inside of front cover in this issue will be
found prospectus of the King of Croydon No. 1 North
Gold-mining Co. The co.’s property consists of 10 acres
at Croydon, N.Q. ; 1316 tons of quartz from this ground
have already been treated fora yield of 5811 oz. of gold, thus
the concern has a substantial reputation to back it as well
as a quantity of good reports. The capital is £15,000 in
60,000 ss. shares, so the venture starts without the crush-
ing over-capitalisation whn.ii has wrecked so many Wes-
tralian and other specs.

Reducing-operations at Burrum Beach (Mary-

button of gold—about 4)40z. The usual bedding of
amalgam left on the plates was estimated at about 4oz. a
plate—altogether 18oz., a handsome return. According
to the prospectors, a man with plates can make about 7s.
a day, and an experienced miner about 18s. The only
trouble is that the plates get somewhat clogged with silver
(or platinum).

Brunnerton colliery, wherein so many lives have
lately been sacrificed to carelessness, has had a chequered
career. It now consists of three mines, about eight miles
from Greymouth. Well on for £150,000 has been swamped
by private owners and by co’s in attempts to develop these
properties, and it is only within the last few years that
the combination of the Westport Coal Co. and the Union
S.S. Co. has caused fairly payable results. The men
worked with naked lights, and, as there were accumula-
tions of explosive gas in all the old workings, it seems
marvellous that no serious explosion occurred before the
present one. In 1893 there was a small one, but little
attention was paid to it. The Brunner editor is being
criminally prosecuted by the co. for his comments on the
catastrophe.

so that the well won’t be blocked by a cave-in whenever

The coming Tasmanian Mt. Lyell law-suit is
causing much exploring of cobwebs by the Melb. legal
brigade. The status of co-adventurers "(commonly called

the legal difference between shares in a piece of land and
shares in a co. owning the land, the transmutations which
a legal right may undergo in its migrations through pros-
pecting parties, syndicates, and half-a-dozen companies,

A. G. Mitchell and Co., of the Strand, Sydney,
are placing “The Gold King Amalgamator” upon the
Australian mining market, and say some very strong
things about it. “ The Gold King is absolutely simple
and easy to work ; it has been crucially tried on all classes
of ore—clay, talc, talcose slate, black and beach sands,
and every time it proves itself “ The Missing Link” in
gold-saving devices ; it saves not only the fine gold, but
all the floured mercury. Hundreds of Gold Kings are
now working in California. The Gold King pays for its
cost in from 30 to 90 days as an equipment to a quartz-
mill. Where water is scarce, the machine can be run with
250 gallons per ton, and this water can be used over a
number of times if necessary. The power is nominal—
viz., from 1-12 h.p. for No. 0 to one h.p. for No. 2.”

Parkes’s death and burial —there were, un-
happily, some very squalid and unrecordable cir-
cumstances connected with the poor old man’s last,
days on earth—gave occasion for the display of
bathos and slobber with which the daily press in-
evitably marks such incidents. Sydney Tele-
okaph, which took the lead in howling Parkes out
of politics, wept gruesomely over “the foremost
man on this continent,” and printed execrable
pictures, in execrable taste, of the dead politician’s
bedroom, with live politicians attitudinising
around ; and of the bearers puffing under the
weight of the coffin. And in between its slabs of
gloom concerning the funeral, it paused to cheer-
fully remark on the scene at Penrith railway re-
freshment-room, when “ the famished mourners
speedily exhausted the stock of sandwiches and
cake.” The S.M. Herald reporter also spread
"TALKING OF TRILBY.”
HE : “ I quite agree with the author’s argument that ‘nothing is so chaste
as the nude figure.”
SHE: “Have you chased it much?”
nimself to great advantage, and noted regarding
the scene at the grave that
It was a beautiful afternoon, and the rugged mountain
scenery formed an admirable background to the mournful
picture. Inside the enclosure, by the open grave rested
the coffin, the polished wood and the silver trimmings
glittering in the sunshine. Nature seemed aglow : but
there was solemn silence—broken only by the reading of
the beautiful service of the Church of England for the
burial of the dead.
“Nature aglow,” providing “rugged mountain
scenery” as “an admirable background” (!) to
“ the coffin, the polished wood, and the silver
trimmings. ” Booh !
But it all goes down, apparently. The sense of
numor amongst daily-paper readers is strong enough
to swallow any anti-climax which isn’t definitoly
labelled a joke and put in the funny column. The
tears of the grieved ten-year-old, the sympathy of
the loathsome advertising wreath - sender, the
telegrams of alleged condolence from schoolboys
(per a pushing headmaster) and from the person at
ifatnberoo who established a particular claim to
get his little oar in on the ground that “ Kiama
was always Sir Henry’s favorite electorate ”
thanks to its “ghost,” no doubt; these things are
all absorbed by the person in the tram along
with the police reports. And Lady Parkes even
thanks Gov. Buxton for his grotesquely consola-
tory letter :
Dear Lady Parkes, I must write a short note to assure
you of my sincere sympathy in the bereavement which
has been permitted to fall on you, and no less in the
responsibility that you feel in reference to the young-
children. When I recently visited Sir Henry Parkes, he
told me how much of careful attention and affection you
had displayed towards them. I think you will now like
to know how much he-appreciated your care of them.
Well-meant, doubtless ; but what impertinence in
a stranger to assure a widow that he hoped she
would be comforted : her dead husband really-
appreciated her care of the children ! What
would Gov. Buxton say if somebody who met him
once took it on himself to assure his wife, whence
goes, that he was really very grateful to her “ for
her careful attention to the children ? ” Gov.
Buxton isn’t a humorous person ; but he would
probably see the incongruity in his own case.
* * * *
The Australian Star plumbed the depths
of bathos in its struggle to be elegiac over Parkes :
“ He died as a patriarch should, gathering his feet
up into the bed, and yielding the ghost Without
moan or sigh.” This assertion that the veteran
gathered up his feet off the floor or out of space is
construable as a reflection on the nurse.
Victorian: “An

tells me that the
explanation of the

The recent S.A. Assembly elections pro-
vide food for reflection. It was confidently antici-
pated that the women would vote in one large
mass for the candidate with a spotless moral
character, ignoring the sensual person with six
wives, but in most cases the latter came out on
top. Similarly, the ladies were invited to
crucify the political Moloch with the pro-
fligate imagination and coarse vocabulary,” but
Moloch got in, as usual. And, despite vigorous
canvassing, the brewers’ nominee was elected
instead Mf the long, thin cold-tea man, simply
because the average S.A. elector much prefers to
swallow beer and temporarily feel like a king than
pour ginger-ale down his neck. Until the tee-
total party invent some drink which will not sit
like a brick on the sovereign elector's stomach its
chance at the polls is small indeed.

The policy favored in the sanctum of the

H. : “ Judge Hood, of Melbourne, de-
cidedly a good judge, has nevertheless been just
affronting my ideas. He had the familiar ‘ Let
him marry the girl ’ case up in court, after a very
bad fashion, the man bringing a girl of 15 into
trouble. The offender wanted to marry his victim,
but her father would not hear of it. Thereupon
the Judge is astounded, and cannot understand
such infatuation. What would he think of the
perverted mind of the girl who said to the Melb.
Police Court Bench : ‘ I will never marry the
man who deceived me. I only want the main-
tenance of his child.’”

A Melb. bigamist got a rational sentence
from Justice Hood, the other day. It was a case
m which the second “wife” had always known
her position, and been properly supported by the
man who put her through a form of marriage,
bhe was the only person who could have been
offended against, and she wasn’t offended in the
least Therefore, the judge, instead of gratifying
the first wife s spite, let the prisoner go forth on
his own recognisance of .£5O. Scores of similar
bigamists have languished in limbo at the instance
of vindictive matrons who, as likely as not, had
refused to live with them aforetime. The vengeance
is chiefly directed against “ the other cat.”

The duties of an Agent-General are mani-
fold. A most fashionable “ bought-and-sold ”
marriage in Australian society was followed by
the usual trip to England, and the happy couple
domiciled as “ paying guests ” in a very high-class
Western boarding-house. Marriage had not,
however, curbed (say) Mrs. Jones’s skittish ness,
and as a result the “ paid ” hostess waited on the
representative official to enquire. She was assured
that they were wealthy, and that she need have
no fear about her account. But no, that was a
very trifling consideration to the hostess, her
fears were much more weighty, as her good name
was at stake : “Were they really married?” she
asked.

The “ sticking-up ” of a Melbourne manu-
facturer last week was a humorous felony. Some
time before 8 o’clock in the evening the commer-
cial gent came bustling along a quiet street in
Richmond (Melb.) when a masked highwayman
put a pistol to his head and told him to turn-out
liis pockets. The demand was promptly met by a
production of £3 10s., which the traveller offered
to place in, the other fellow’s left hand. Suspect-
ing treacherous intent, the masquer (who was
probably quaking with terror) ordered his victim
to put the coin on the footpath and walk away,
and whilst the obedient boot-builder made nervous
tracks for the nearest police - station Barabbas
departed with the booty down a side turning.
There is really no hero to this story.

“Shearer” tells The Bulletin this story :
“ While travelling in New England looking for
shearing we struck a very Irish old lady’s selection
and got work. My mate was a town-bred lad,
decently educated, and Mrs. Muldoon couldn’t
stand him at any price—everything he said or did
was wrong. One night at tea we were talking poli-
ties, when madame chipped in: it was a great
shame, she said, that she, a woman with a bit of pro-
perty, hadn’t a vote. ‘Then you think, Mrs. Mul-
doon,’ said my mate, ‘ that it’s desirable to extend
the franchise to women?’ Whereupon the old girl
flured-up furiously : * Oi’ll give you a shlap across
the mouth,’she said, ‘if ever agen you use that
filthy blackguard talk in front of my little gurrl.”
The trouble in the N.S.W. “ Irish ” Rifle
Corps is the difficulty of providing commissions
for the number of patriotic “ gintlemin ” who will
bestow their patronage on the “ ragement ” if they
are appointed officers. Another little difficulty is
that many “ big men ” who don’t want to directly
recognise the regiment are anxious to get a son
or two in if “a bit o’ rank ” can be given them.

One Supreme Court Judge is not going the
right way to become a favorite with the legal
profession, both branches of which complain of
(say it softly) his Honor’s manners—or want of
them—in court. In a country town lately, a
leading local solicitor entered court, sat down at
the bar-table, or rather —since the Attorneys’
SUNDAY-AT THE SHEDS.
HALF-TIME PARSON (who has arrived to hold service at the sheds):
“ Well, my good man, any o’ my flock here yet?”
ROUSEABOUT (from the Never-Never): “Don’t know; haven’t seen
any. What’s yer ear-mark?”
Right of Audience Act—the table set apart for
the use of the legal professions, and put his hat
down in front of him. “ Will you take your hat
off the table, Mr. Blank ? ” said the judge. This
is not a police-court! ” If his Honor continues to
cultivate this style, a now absent judge will find on
his return to Australia that he has a formidable
rival in his celebrated performance— how not to
behave on the bench. ”

The Maoriland census-
papers, just issued, show that
one old-established Irish grie-
vance has at last been re-
medied. The back of the
paper contains a list of an
imaginary household —that of
a certain Thompson—as an
example of how the particu-
lars should be filled in, and
for many years this list has
ended with the name of
“ Bridget Connelly, aged 23,
unmarried, domestic servant,
Roman Catholic, born in Ire-
land, can’t read or write.”
Almost all the provinces, m
the “ example ” on their cen-
sus-papers, also wind up with
an Irish slavey who can’t read
or write, and this general as-
sumption of Bridget’s ignor-
ance has roused such indigna-
tion that the Seddon Govern-
ment has now taken her off
the paper altogether, and re-
placed her with one Susan
Smith. Bridget, presumably,
lias gone out of the servant
“gal” business.
H.C. : “If a law were
passed that divorces of church-
made marriages must needs
be granted by the churches
making them, before being re-
cognised by law, with attractive fees attached, the
now-objecting clergy would probably support it
warmly —barring, perhaps, the infallible Pope s
following.

Nothing has lately been heard of the re-
consideration of the case of the Mount Rennie
prisoners. It is well-known that the late barrister
Healy was, at the time of his death, engaged in
reporting on the case for the alleged Minister for
Justice. But the nature of his report, if he made
a report, does not seem to be known. The absence
of Judge Windeyer affords a good opportunity for
the release of the survivors—who, like the hanged
boys, were not tried but lynched.

The betting in London (writes a sour
Bulletin correspondent, whose letter this paper
prints as a warning) is about even that radical
Reeves, the new M.L. Agent-General, will be
muzzled with the infallible K.C.M.G.-ship. He
has had a long interview with Chamberlain, am l
according to the press, “ came away full of admira
tion for that statesman.” Pushful .Toe knows
well by experience how to deal with radical “colo-
nials, ” whose sound and fury in 999 cases out of
1000 disappears the moment they come into con-
tact with real swells. An introduction to a stray
countess, and a few invitations to “ the best
houses,” and the last state of the radical becomes
worse than the first —for wives love to be able to
put ‘ ‘ Lady ” on their visiting-cards. I bet that
Reeves is doomed. Meanwhile the departure of
his predecessor from office is much regretted, for
Perceval was a model Agent-General. Suave and
yet strong, he united the social charm of old Saul
Samuel with the official firmness of Playford.
The shipping firm of Huddart, Parker &
Co. has been troubled of late with a deranged pas-
senger. Said passenger, in a lucid interval,
shipped himself at Melbourne for Maoriland, but
on the voyage he became violently insane, and the
M.L. authorities refused to let him land unless the
shipping co. became responsible for his board,
lodging and medical attendance so long as he
remained incapable, which might be fifty years or
more. He was then brought to Sydney, but the
same difficulty arose there. An attempt was
made to return him to Victoria, but though that
province didn’t mind letting its lunatic out, it
drew the line at letting him in again, and he was
rejected. In short, the marine crank was offered
at a great reduction to all the provinces, and
declined. Then, finding it had either to carry
him back and forward and round about as a per-
manent affliction, and let him gibber on deck on
moonlight nights, or else become responsible for
his keep, the co. landed him at Melbourne, and
entered him as a permanent charge against the
profits. As a solitary item he doesn’t matter so
very much, but if this sort of thing happens often
the shipping go’s may take to dropping their
lunatic overboard on dark nights and saying
nothing about him.

Spagnoletti : “ There ought to be a half-
yearly gaol-clearance. This way : Every now and
again one hears of some well-known character
who has been let out of prison, prematurely, and
three times as many, probably more, are let out on
the sly. But how about the poor unknown men,
or even women ? I have seen a man get four years
for stealing a waistcoat. Another gets, possibly,
15 years for sacrilege, in stealing some tin-pots
from the conventicle where the Judge goes.”
Apropos, memo, for Vic. M.’sP. How about
the man who long: ago got 15 or 20 years for
sacrilege ? Is he still in gaol, or is he dead, or re-
leased ? And was he sentenced by a Judge of the
church against which the offence was committed ?

DEA EX MACHINA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Long years ago, ere legs were in the cast,
Or tanks, or trains, or women with a past,
The play bloomed bright;
To solve the complications he had wrought
The ancient dramatist bestowed no thought,
For, when things got much mixed in any scene,
A god swung from the flies in a machine
To put them right.
To-day, a helmless ship without a chart,
Life groans ’neath Ibsen drama, Beardsley Art;
The crank' looms great.
Buck to the chaos black from whence it came,
The world seems bound to shiver in its shame,
When—quick, with aspect confident and keen—
The goddess pedals out on her machine
To set things straight.

Sydney, May 5, 1896.
My Dear Moorabinda —
The latest Sydney society fad is the formation
of a cycling-club for ladies and gentlemen. It has
its rise at the barracks, where there is a greai
donning of bloomers thinly veiled in skirts, anc
mounting of wheels—for which the barracks gee
gee, that unwisely carries a lady, is, no doubt
truly grateful. Many a dashing militaire haulec
over the coals by Major-General Hutton for riding
a galled horse on parade will also bless the day the
Bicycle Club sets sail. But I don’t think thai
quite all the society damsels are joining in the
new club.
Apropos bloomers —though, to be honest, the
great original hideous knickerbocker is no more
like the ugly peg-top pantaloon tied in round the
ankles with absurd little bows of ribbon than
ballet-girl’s tights are like Bishop Smith’s gaiters.
Women may congratulate themselves on having
appropriated man’s nether garments in the teeth
of Lawnorder, but it’s only a false triumph, after
all, for a woman was arrested in Melbourne re-
cently on a charge of disorderly conduct because
she had trousers on.
There must be something sacred and unapproach-
able about pants that even the New Woman can-
not overcome or relegate to the limbo of exploded
fads. Though at first blush one would think that
a moral and virtuous Bench would be far more
shocked at Eve in knickers, which reveal so much
of her, than at Eve in discreet trousers lapping
well over her insteps, the inscrutable Law has de-
clared that a woman in trousers is disorderly,
while a female in knickerbockers is merely
ridiculous. Half a yard or so more of material
below the garter converts a comic cut to a breech
I mean a breach of the peace. How grotesquely
inconsistent! It looks as if the rational-dress
movement was actually tying the Law in a knot.
Miss May Mitchell’s piano recital at Sydney
Y.M.C.A., the other day, proclaimed itself an
amateur-show by the large audience, which had
girded up its complimentary ticket, so to speak—
otherwise, it looked very much like the ordinary
conventional concert. I found it pleasant, as a case
in point, to show how a talented pupil may perfect
herself in music without going ’Ome and getting
seasick or becoming engaged to the first mate.
Miss Mitchell displayed the true artistic tempera-
ment in her performance of several severe and
first-class items, and got in some fine effects in her
duets with her teacher, Mons. Kowalski. If she
doesn’t end up in the van of the long-haired
brigade, her debut'was one of the most misleading
events I ever witnessed.
A company of clever operatic amateurs, who
have no distinguishing appellation, played “ Pina-
fore ” at Sydney Gaiety Theatre the other evening
in aid of the North Sydney Hospital, which is
suffering from quite a church-like attack of lack
of funds. Lady Hampden was billed to attend,
but owing to the death of ex-Premier Parkes the
V.R. presence was withdrawn. When a local
big-wig dies it usually means a night or so off for
Guvmentouse, which only gets a holiday under
the shadow of grim Death. There was a large
attendance of sympathisers, and the operetta went
briskly, all the performers—save a new and very
successful Hebe—having won their spurs in it at
suburban representations. Miss Deakin, as
Josephine; Mrs. Imray, as Buttercup; Mr.
Beattie, as a fine-eyed Captain Corcoran ; and Mr.
Rainford as Deadeye, made the hits of the even-
ing, as they did before.
Apropos “ Pinafore,” it is one of Mr. Tither-
adge’s stories how he arrived in Sydney with the
only book of the words obtainable in Australia,
which he had bought in London for 6d. or so, and
which the play-pirates, who then infested these
shores, vainly offered him .£4O for. Needless to
say the virtuous mummer resisted the temptation.
The lawn-tennis contest began to leap at Sydney
Association Ground last Saturday, which was
also Hospital Saturday, a day when every
street is stuck -up by brigand philan-
thropists in petticoats, and most people stop at
home and sit on their small change as the only
way of keeping it safe. Consequently, there
wasn’t an alarming crowd at the tennis—though
the ball-and-racket question is always like a snow-
ball, gathering as it goes, so that the last state of
the gate is better than the first, and meridian
attendance is always reached when Her Ex. is
handing out plated butter-pots on the last day to
the exhausted victors. The match this year has
attracted Cornstalk, Gumsucker, and Bananaland
experts—one new champion entering the lists
bearing the, honeymoon-cum-nursery name of
“Diddams.” As I said, the tennis crowd wasn’t
a success on Saturday, and when a “ buster ”
acting in the special interests of the clothing-
trade, apparently—first smothered ’em in dust and
rubbed it well into the nap with a watering-pot
shower of rain, the woe-begone scatter put a suit-
able termination to a bald and unconvincing after-
noon.
Under the somewhat palpitating heading, “ Dis-
covery of a foreign nobleman,” the D.T. “ special
reporter ” recently tells how at some unheard-of
halting-place on Gov. Hampden’s recent ride to
Glen Innes, His Ex. was astonished at the per-
fection of some omelettes achieved by the shanty
cook, who, to cut a long story short, turned out to
be a high-toned political exile in the shape of a
Hungarian count making flap-jacks in a wayback
hostelry ! Gov. Hampden, with the overpowering
yearning to shake hands with everybody which
amounts to a mania in Governors, sought out the
count in his kitchen to thank him for his pancake,
and, also, to bowl him out for a barber, but the
count, “ an active old gentleman of 78,” proved to
be a bona-fide, and H.E. made the discovery that
he had known his brother, Prince Batthyany, in
London. But Gov. H. must get accustomed to
that sort of thing in Australia, where it’s ten to
one your horse is rubbed down by Lord Tomnoddy
come to the end of his tether. The Australian
bush is full of aristocrats banished for all sorts of
reasons, from politics to pocket-picking. Gov. H.
will presently discover that the toniest gathering
he could possibly arrange in Australia, so far as
Court Circular names go, would have its guests
recruited from the shearing-shed, the drovers’
camp, the stable-yard and the hotel-kitchen of this
large and woolly continent.
Gov. Hampden on tour has not been asked to
stand godfather to anybody’s bald, pink infant so
far—in which he has better luck in the North than
ex-Gov. Carington, who graciously allowed a
happy couple to call their bouncing boy, who
arrived during the Gov. ’s visit, ‘ ‘ Carington Blank, ”
and sent the infant a silver mug on his return to
town. To have a vice-regal godfather is one of
the most capricious streaks of luck, as some people
call it, that can befall an unconscious bush baby.
It has got to be born when the Governor is paying
a visit to its parents’ township, and, as these
things are difficult to arrange to the exact tick of
the watch, the chances that the Gov. or the baby
will arrive too soon or too subsequently for one
another make it a most open finish. Gov. Hamp-
den has only Fate to thank that his reckless
roamings (in the best interests, apparently, of the
Fresh Food and Ice Co.) haven’t led to a baker’s
dozen or so of little red “ Hampden ” Brown-
Joneses and Robinsons all calling him god-father
and waiting expectantly for silver sop-holders.
On dit that one of the latest potentates to
strike Australia is rapidly establishing a reputa-
tion for thrift that argues either a very stingy soul
or a sadly shallow pocket. The latest story goes
that H.E. assumes a pained expression in the face
of his tailor’s bill, and goes over the items in a
most disconcerting manner—remarking, “ I nevah
gave moah than (so much less) for my vests at
home,” or “Isn’t (such-and-such) an alarming price
for a pair of—aw—twousers ? ” Tailors can only
hope and pray that the vice-regal haggle won’t
catch on in the clubs.
It was over the maiden reception of this careful
potentate, by the way, that a Society damsel, on
her promotion, showed her bounce by writing to
Guvmentouse, setting forth that, as her fashion-
able wedding was billed for the same date, Her
Ex. would, of course, see the feasibility of post-
poning the Y.R. reception, “ as all the best people
will be at my wedding. ’ But the rudest part of
the whole thing was that the hide-bound damsel
wrote to an official, urging him to use his influ-
ence to secure the postponement, “as all the best
people,” etc. —the official in question not being
amongst her invited. Needless to say, the recep-
tion came off, and looked just as impressive as
usual.
“ Saved from the Sea ” is Bland Holt’s latest
novelty at Sydney Royal, and any youth who
aspires to be funny-man at a picnic-party is ad-
vised to go and earnestly regard the ever-popular
Bland Holt as he sends the plates skidding round
the table, sits in the salad, and steals the pigeon-
pie. Of course, it is highly improbable that the
aforesaid youth would be given the same license as
Billy Brown at a real picnic, but he might try the
effect, at any rate; the results would be interest-
ing to onlookers, proving how far the stage may
be imitated with safety by would-be comedians in
private life. The picnic interlude (set in a scene
refreshingly like the Leura Falls) is the brightest
in the play, Bland Holt’s rendering of two catchy
songs livening up the rather painful melodrama
immensely.
“ Saved from the Sea ” does not lend itself to a
great rush of clothing to the heroine, Miss Watson,
who makes an artistic fisherman’s lass in blue and
a scarlet kerchief—later in white muslin and
another scarlet touch, and thirdly in a snuff-
colored houppelunde and a funny little bonnet like
a limpet. Mrs. Bland Holt rollicked through the
perky part of Polly in becoming rustic costume,
and the scenery suggested Yere Foster. The only
property I didn’t understand happened in Baker’s
cottage for Cosgrove to get murdered in, and
looked like a cradle on end serving its time as a
chair while awaiting further family developments.
There was a large and cordial house, and the collec-
tion of fans in the dress-circle was interesting
Perhaps the oddest were a black-and-white snread-
eagle arrangement suggesting gridiron marks on a
pigeon’s wing, cheek by jowl with a three-cornered
plaid wind-raiser for all the world like a tartan
tart.
So far, I am told, the Brisbaneites see the
Lamingtons through rose-colored glasses A
theless? the lively daughter of a departcddynasty
is sadly missed in her capacity of so y
That frisky heroine, _ with her recor( J> r ®^°
imaginary, of clandestine appearances at suburban
assemblies, furous deck-flirtations, alK | l t ~ ’
supplied a sauce which seasoned the cold-button
so to speak, of the rest of her clan, and the
of which already brands the vice-regal honey-
mooners of to-day as insipid. , ,
It was fortunate that the Factory Chris u
ball was held this year at Paddington Town Ha l,
for the slim, though fashionable, attendance would
have looked a mere row of pins in Sahara had tne
function come off in the Town Hall. I lie ba
room was principally decorated with the u
lines of flags, apparently hung out to dry and
never taken in, which are the unvarying adorn-
ment of the Paddington ball-room, augmented by
ferns and palms, and the cosy dais was tricked out
with roses. Lady Hampden (who peers at Society
through a double eye-glass, and makes a
buffer of her committee-bouquet in the vice-
regal lancers) sported precisely the same turn-out
she wore at the agricultural ball, augmented by a
large com. posy of roses tied wit 1 the Hampden
colors. By the way, I don’t think such towering
bouquets are the kindest things to present to Her
Ex., who must sometimes fee) sprained from the
effects of holding them straight. Miss Brand
wore complexion colors —pink and white and the
most swagger appearance in the V.R. party was
an importation in pink jauntily rigged out with
pink tulle fluffily bordered, and ropes of unmounted
pink roses. It was the one distinctly new turn-
out in an ocean of resurrections.
Mrs. Harvey (hon. sec.) wore black satin and
chiffon, slightly teased on the bodice with gold
embroidery, but the average dressing was not
brilliant, but distinctly Mondayish. Two damsels
in bluish and strawberry plush respectively looked
more like a pair of occasional chairs than anything
else ; a strawberry blonde accentuated her wara-
tah-like appearance by a pale blue gown ; and a
matron in green and pink, with an odd sort of
pink tab protruding at the back, looked like a
ballroom-edition of the famous nursery hero,
Giddy-Giddy-Gout. A very special menu-decorated
supper occurred at the right moment, and floor
and music were above reproach, but the attend-
ance was the smallest the G.F. Club ball has
scored so far.
The increased number of women in hot-cross-
bun badges, carting round the noisy collection-
boxes in Sydney on Hospital Saturday, looked as
if the memory of the wealthy husband recently
achieved by a Sydney belle, all through her pro-
specting for coins at the entrance to Sydney’s
cniefest hotel, has raised a fresh crop of enthusi-
asts in the good cause —the number of new faces
being positively amusing. The general consensus
of masculine opinion, so far as I heard, was that
the last collectresses were not so good-looking as
other batches, and there was a complaint lodged
that most of those who were pretty militated the
effect with veils. Hilda Spong made a success of
her stall, and is about the first actress to advertise
herself over the hospital-collecting biz.
Sydney has been more like a shambles than a
city of late—we have had each day our daily
murder—one of the latest loving husbands,
accused of forcibly transforming himself into a
widower, bearing the suggestive name of Love.
Mr. Love, who tried to shoot himself, is now in
custody, and his case may once more illustrate
that which has been so often written : “ Marriage
is the death of Love.”
Writes my Melb. correspondent.—
“ Melb.’s new Mayoress is holding a series of
weekly afternoon receptions in the Town Hall.
The first took place last Wednesday, when almost
the whole of female Melb. was jammed into the
narrow ‘Mayor’s’ room together with refresh-
ment-tables, scores of pot-plants, much furniture,
and several aldermen —this on a close autumn
afternoon with a sticky north wind blowing out-
side. Those ladies who rushed in to grab the
Mayoral hand and snatch a fearful cup of tea
when the door was opened at three o’clock were,
by the force of the crush, compelled to remain until
the tide of callers ceased at about 5.30, and were
finally removed in an almost fainting condition.
Mrs. strong, the Mayoress, is an elegant-looking
woman, with a sweetness of expression somewhat
rare in these days. She much resembles Alex-
andra of Wales, without ‘ our sweet princess’s ’
excessive and rather out-of-date girlishness and
was suitably and handsomely gowned in black
silk. I oik m the know ’ were much amused at
watching an unwitting individual endeavoring to
introduce the second wife of a divorcee to the
sister of his first. The icy glances exchanged
during the contretemps mercifully reduced the
temperature for yards round the indignant pair.

SPORTING NOTIONS .
Bi cycle champions will presently get divided
into two classes-those who can do without pacemakers
and those who can’t. Then the champion able to win
“on his own ” will challenge the other sort of fellow to
race him as runners and scullers race, with a clear course
before them. And the bike “authorities (which don’t
appear to exist, thus far) will have to fix the conditions
under which championships are to be decided

Jack Carlton, of N. Melb. C.C., has about the
best 1895-6 Australian I u cricket bowling record: 2000
balls, 60 wickets ; average, iu.B runs.

“Graham is suffering from rheumatism and
Trumble from a bad cold. During the voyage Jones
slipped and injured his arm.” The new Australian Eleven
has started the usual '.rst of unlucky circumstances that
“ militate against the success of the tour, as cricket
journalism puts it. - .
Harris’s show of racing against the trotter,
Osterley, on the cinder track at Richmond (Melb.), was a
miserable farce. The bikist tried one heat, finishing fully
100 yards behind the sulky, and then gave himself up as
a bad job. The' track was too rough, according to the
unreliable Britisher. Subsequently Martin, with a flying
start, beat Osterley’s time.
* * * *
Pursey Chirnside’s Australian Trotting Ass. is
as snobbish as an English “gentleman.” It advertised a
match between Mr. John Robertson’s Osterley and W.
Martin, champion bicyclist. Why should Robertsor
driving a pneumatic sulky be Mister any more than cyclist
Martin driving his pneumatic wheel ?
Melb. should be thankful for cycle-god Parsons’s
departure for one reason. You can’t walk up street with-
out meeting a photo, of J.W.P. in every other window,
labelled : “ Dear Sir,—l have found your 4d. bar yellow
soap matchless for the voice and complexion. J. W.
Parsons.” Or “ Dear Sir,—Prior to beating the Aus-
tralian mile-record, I wore a pair of your unparalleled
pants, and can testify to the advantage, &c. J. W.
Parsons.” Or “ Dear Sir,—Your prime chops at 7d. a lb.
kept me in rare form up to the date of my match with
Martin. J. W. Parsons.” It grows monotonous.
* * * *
Parsons has left Melbourne single. Mr. E. B.
Russell, father of Miss Belle Russell, desires to contradict
the statement that a marriage was -pending between his
daughter and the Victorian wheelman, and says that the
circulation of the story has given much annoyance.

Melb. opening football matches aroused no
enthusiasm. The principal game, Melb. v. Essendon,
watched in comparative silence, indicated poor prospects
of present popularity. A fair game, no barracking and
execrable umpiring showed what a shadow of its former
self is a contest which, two years ago, would have
attracted every leather-lunged ruffian in Melb. Essendon
won by 9 to 5, and may be premiers this year.

Now that Pompadour Corbett’s financial pro-
spects have been well gauged in Melbourne, he will likely
visit Australia. His agent is already on hand to make
sure of the dollars. Pomp, leaves his company in the
States, and will travel on the athletic racket. He ought
to draw. People are bound to step along to see a man
who can talk the rest of the fighting world blind, and jaw
for a year without stopping. Dooley is down for an eight-
round go with the ex-bank clerk. Should Mick happen to
accidently send the ’Merkan gas-meter out, the great Aus-
tralian bashing brigade would stand on its head for a
week. i

Fitzsimmons, like John L., refused the Police
Gazette championship “ dog collar.” Which causes the
donor R. K Fox, to say that Fitz. is frightened to meet
Corbett. The champion has told Pomp. Jim to go and

POLITICAL
POINTS
Jingoism—Jingoism, fruitless howling.
Queensland has one Railway Commis-
sioner, South Australia one, Victoria one, and
N.S. Wales three.
John Norton, as secretary of the N.S.W.
Protectionist party, in which position he is strongly
supported by Lyne, parries Crick’s ambition for
leadership.
Bible-reading is said to be compulsory in
at least one Vic. State school, where the head
teacher rounds up all Protestant pupils for scrip-
ture lesson during school hours.
If, as is prophesied, one of the Newcastle
colleries shortly introduces non-union labor whole-
sale, the Reid Ministry will find itself in the
tightest place it has yet occupied.
Let it be said to the credit of Parkes that
he denounced the despatch of the Soudan con-
tingent. Perhaps only jealousy of Dailey inspired
the denunciation ; still, he did denounce it.
By, it is said, the orders of the Arch-
bishop, 22 nuns went to the poll at North Adelaide
—in the interests of Glynn and Harrold, the Tory
candidates. The clergy follow the collection-plate.
Adelaide Quiz did some remarkably good
tipping at the S.A. election. The results are now
definitely known in 25 electorates ; in 17 of these
it tipped both winners, and in the other eight it
tipped one of the two winners each time.
An Argus heading:—“The Matabele
Rising. Estimated Death Roll. 1000 Matabele
Killed, 300 Whites Murdered.” That command-
ment must have been sub edited by Moses ; it was
meant to read : “ Thou shall not kill a Britisher.”
MORBIDLY IRRITABLE OVER IT.
MIRANDA: “ Pa, I 'want ”-
PA : “ No, you don't; you can't have it. I can't afford it. This beastly, infamous, impoverish-
ing Landaninkum Tax”-
MIRANDA: “I was about to say, pa, I want you to come in to dinner; the soup's getting cold."
At current rate of retrenchment N.S.W
Civil Service Board is estimated to save a tota
of .£200,000 a year. The coincidence here is that
12 months before the appointment of the Board
Premier Reid said the Service could bear retrench-
ment to the extent of =£200,000.
Chamberlain has announced that the “ in-
vitation ” to President Kruger to visit England
had been withdrawn. A royal invitation is a
command. What is a governmental one? At
any rate, it has been withdrawn—to save appear-
ances, after Kruger had declined it.
Mayor Ives boldlv condemns State inter-
ference with any of the pursuits of private enter-
prise. And yet, as Mayor, he affixes lus approving
seal to Sydney municipal by-laws, under which
cabmen and vanmen are penalised if they ask
more than municipally-specified rates for their
services.
Courier : “ The rising note of loyalty met
Lord Lamington in the North. None of the dis-
loyalists seemed to be anxious to start a Social
Democratic Republic.” And the North replied
the same week by sending in member after mem-
ber pledged to the principles of social democracy.
At the present rate of hearing the case
against Jameson at Bow-street police-court, his
conviction wouldn’t happen before the end of next
year. The Salisbury Government is on the look-
out for something—say the Pretoria trial of Col.
Frank Rhodes &, Co. —as an excuse for dropping
proceedings against Jameson.
Of what avail is the secrecy of the ballot
on a Queensland station where the sum-total of
votes recorded is two to three, which are counted
o i the premises almost immediately ? In the
United Kingdom the ballot-boxes from various
polling-places are mixed before the votes are
counted—a reform urgently needed in more than
one of the Australias.
A new order of knighthood has been

Now, Col. Bell, let us hear you swear.
It is difficult to get away from an old
wheeze when once it has become imbedded in the
system. Within the last two months <£2,000,000
of British capital has gone to the Thames (M.L.),
and it keeps arriving faster and faster. At least
<£500,000 has gone to the West Coast, and the
representative of a German syndicate with another
<£2,000,000 to invest has just arrived with a view
to buying up local mines. And yet Capt. Russell,
leader of the Tory Opposition, started the election
campaign the other day with the usual statement
that the Socialistic policy of the Government was
“ driving capital out of the country.” That state-
ment has been made so often within the last four
years that it makes itself now.
Attorney-General Want, on his return from
Japan, found amongst the depositions awaiting
investigation in his office those connected with
the committal of a country medico for homicide.
The committal had taken place on the strength of
“telegrams” and “other written documents
from the Govt, analyst, who was not called upon
to give oral testimony. Mr. Want quickly found
that there was no evidence against the medico
and “threw out the bill.” How long was this
serious charge kept hanging over the doctor s head
through the absence of King Jack on a fishing ex-
cursion in Japan ?
The defeat of certain Labor representa-
tives was balm to the soul of Mathieson, the Q.
railway boss, who cordially detests the prying eyes
of democracy. About the shabbiest trick ever
done in Bananaland was the sending for the gold
railway-pass of Fisher (ex-M.L.A. for Gympie)
before the final result of the election was actually
declared.
Et tu , Brute! “ With all our assumption
of enlightenment and superiority, we are actually
becoming narrow, non-progressive, and conceited.
• . . We are so self-satisfied that we think we
make the best, finest, and most attractive articles
in the world. ... We practically fling our
goods at other people’s heads, and say—‘ Take
them or leave them, as you choose !’ ”—U.S.
Consul-General Bell, about his countrymen.
The worst - paid
and most improvident
set of workers in Aus-
tralasia are the Tas-
manians. The only
active labor organisa-
tion in the island is
the Zeehan branch of
the Miners’ Associa-
tion, and even that is
largely controlled by
the publican and store-
keeper “ honorary ”
members. The rail-
way employes have a
sort of union—merely
a benefit-fund and
at the end of every
year all the surplus
cash in hand is divi-
ded pro rata among
the members to pur-
chase a high - class
Christmas spree.
At a Melb. Meet-
ing W. D. Flynn
argued against
woman - suffrage on
the grounds that as
the final appeal must
always be to physical
force, and as women
were incapable of bear-
ing arms, they should
have no power of
directing or control-
ling the physical force
of the community by
their votes. To be
logical, Flynn, in his
argument of “no re-
sponsibility no
power,” must cancel
the votes of all men
incapable of bearing
arms, which is one
way of abolishing the
present Upper
Houses. Physical in-
capacity does not
postulate either a
desire or an aptitude
for dodging respon-
sibility. Anyway, the
new woman will cheer-
fully take the risk,
simply because she is,
after all, the same old
woman who has
always had to take
the risks of war
whether she wanted
to or not.
Melb. Age on Parkes :
Literature was not his forte ; but rather the manipula-
tion of men. Not being cursed with any strong convic-
tions, he became an Opportunist in the strongest sense oi
the term, and never during the long course of his public
career did he lose his tendency to count heads, althougn
he often counted wrong. . . . As an Opportunist, he
patted Federation on the back one day, and on the next
refused to take any steps to bring it to accomplishment.
... To compare Parkes with Higinbotham, M Culloch
or Graham Berry would be absurd. Those Victorian
statesmen had that element of political genius —initiative
in which Parkes was deficient.
The emphatic answer of the referendum to
the S.A. schismatics and Tories who wished to in-
troduce the turbulent elements of theology into
the State schools should be a stunner for the Vic.
piety agitators, who declare that the people are
anxious to blast up the existing system in order to
introduce the Bible, denominational grants, and
the apostles of cant. The Vic. system is fast
abolishing dissension, religious and racial, amongst
the younger generations, hence it must have
enemies in the parsons and politicians who
flourish on the internecine hatreds of the people.
Melb. Argus audaciously cited Parkes as
a sad example of the human suffering that comes
of Protection. “His early history was pathetic.
He grew up in ignorance ; he suffered from starva-
tion. He lived in those hard days when the High
Tariff party ruled England, and sought to bar her
off from customers and from outside abundance-
endeavored to make her a dear country for the
working man,” and so forth. To which might as
well be added—“ He died in straitened circum-
stances as soon as Reid’s Freetrade had
fairly begun to blast his adopted land.
“Lands” Carruthers (N.S.W.) says that
there is no more sincere champion of Australian
Federation than Premier Reid. Not two years
ago Reid was the champion opponent of the cause.
Half-a-dozen years ago, Damshicawgo Dibbs was
a red republican ; now he is an Imperial ennobblee,
Jingoing for loyal military fame. Half-a-dozen
years ago, Postmaster-General Joe Cook was a
miners’-union taader, a theorising Socialist, and a
suspected firebrand ; now, he is a member of the
God-fearing Government, ’ a mealy - mouthed,
well-groomed person of the nauseously Respect-
able order. Many other notable Australian in-
stances could be cited. See how time and
politics twist human nature, which is pretty muoh
of a muchness all round- the exceptions being the
cranks, who die in their own dirt and unshaven
chins. The modifications depend chiefly on a
man’s luck. If he “gets on,” he can’t resist his
surroundings. He would be false to “ No. 1” if
he did. “ Give me a fat sinecure,” is the average
mail’s religion.
The new New York excise law, which,
after a bitter struggle, has been passed by both
Houses of the Legislature, absolutely forbids the
selling on Sunday, either in saloons or clubs, of
even a bottle of beer with a dinner. Laws of that
sort are made to be broken. If a hundred decent
white men rent a building for club purposes they
can run that club for 50 years and in it wade up
to their necks in whisky on every day and night
AN INSULT.

legal evidence that such a club exists.
A bill now before the British Parliament
poses to prohibit foreign sailors serving on
ritish ships unless they can pass an examination
in the English language. As Hans Jorgensen
and Knut Knutsen and Mohammed Ali generally
only learn their English on board, this will shut
out three-fourths of the foreigners, and it is in-
tended to do so. In other words, it is proposed
to protect the British sailor without saying so in
actual words ; the foreigner is to be barred out,
not because he is a foreigner, but on the ground
that he can’t understand quickly enough when he
is ordered to heave the binnacle overboard. It is
reported, bytheway, that out of 180,000 “1. ’tish”
sailors 160,000 are either Mahommed Ali or Hans
Jorgensen or Ah Sin, or words to that effect.
Britannia hires someone else to rule the waves
for her nowadays.
A “Madman’s Legacy”
“ Sire ! ” exclaimed a man in the plain garb of a
mechanic, to Richelieu, Prime Minister of France,
as he was entering his palace, “ Sire, I have made
a discovery which shall make rich and great the
nation which shall develope it. Sire, will you
give me an audience ? ”
Richelieu, constantly opportuned, finally ordered
the “ Madman ” to be imprisoned. Even in gaol he
did not desist from declaring his “delusion,” which
one day attracted the attention of a British noble-
man, who heard De Caux's story, and developed
his discovery of steam power. All great dis-
coveries are at first derided.
Nearly a quarter of a century ago an eminent,
wealthy business.man lay stricken with Bright’s
Disease. His physician said recovery was im-
possible. He used a new discovery, which, like
all advances in science, had been bitterly opposed
by the profession. Nevertheless it cured him.
The case was so prominent that the medicine was
at once subjected to severe tests by the most
eminent scientists, which resulted in its introduc-
tion into every part of the world. Such is the
brief history of Warner’s Safe Cure, which has
now, according to the testimony of eminent
persons, the most deserved reputation ever ac-
corded to any medicine, and its fame now belts
the globe.
What proof have we in our midst ? Ample ; of
which this is one:—Mr. Richard Peake, of
“ Peake’s Find,” West Australia, writes, “ I was a
martyr to deep-seated kidney disease. All treat-
ments and doctors tried failed, and Warner’s Safe
Cure cured me. Publish my experience that other
sufferers may read it.”

Dear Bulletin, The
“clever counsel” you mention
as vouching with his translations
for his sanity at the time he
made them can’t be very strong,
at all events, in medical juris-
prudence, or he would know
that perfect consecutiveness in
one direction is not, of itself,
any proof that the mind isn’t
hopelessly honeycombed in an-
other. A case perfectly in point,
and within my personal know-
ledge, was that of an excellent
all-round scholar, acute and
coherent in conversation and
particularly shrewd in literary
criticism, who was nevertheless
perfectly undisturbable in the
grotesque belief that he had a
monkey in his stomach ! It was
only when he began to explain
how such a thing was physically
possible that the “ crack ” be-
came apparent.— Speculum
Australia’s foremost biblio-
phile is a very wealthy Syd-
neyite, a non-practising bachelor
barrister, who has given his life
and devoted his income to the
accumulation of a now unique
and priceless library. No other
Australian possesses such a
hoard of literature concerning
Australia. The bibliophile lives
a solitary life among his beloved
books and pours out thousands
in adding to them, no trouble or
expense being too great for him
when in quest of a rare volume
or valuable MS Few people
have been privileged to inspect
his magnificent library, and he
much resents the intrusion of the
curious. It is related that when
Robert Louis Stevenson visited
Sydney he went to the collector’s
home, rang the bell, and sent in
his card. Presently the book-
sellers’ joy appeared. “I am
Robert Louis Stevenson,” said
the visitor. “And lam replied the
bibliophile, holding out his hand. “Allow me,
Mr. Stevenson, to wish you good morning.”
Queen Victoria, says the cable, has created

Apropos Jack Monahan, the Melb. mil-

HOSPITAL SATURDAY IN SYDNEY.
Cabled that at the Colonial Institute’s
annual dinner in London, among those present
was Sir William C. Windeyer, Chancellor of Syd-
ney University. This must be the person who
“ tried ” the Mount Rennie case. Cablegrams are
so inexplicit.
The death of Parkes leaves Archibald
Michie, Q.C., of Melbourne, the last survivor of
the speakers at the anti-transportation meeting,
and the meeting to protest against the landing of

Sydney harbour, in 1849.
It should be counted for righteousness to
the somewhat uncertain B. R. Wise that of all the
political pals whose public importance Parkes
more or less made, Wise was the only one who
stuck to the old man fallen upon evil days and
evil tongues. Some of the others have been think-
ing to make it up with tearful slobber over the
veteran’s coffin, but it shouldn’t wash. “ Give me

old Jack Robertson.

Melb. demise : Fook Shing, ex-Chinese
detective. He returned to China, but came back
again here, apparently because of a mistaken im-
pression in the polite circles of Foo Chow that he
was an informer, whereas he was purely a salaried
public official. Fook’s weakest point was that he
gambled like an American minstrel, and whenever
the fan-tan prosecutions came on they rubbed it
into him, from Aspinall down to Gillot. But a
Chinaman seems to turn to wood in middle life,
becoming an animated relative to the renowned
Soo Chow forest of cinnamon-trees, south of the
clouds.
The N.S.W. Public Service Commis-
sioners, in the course of their travels, reached a
certain Government office and asked the head of
the department if he could suggest any method of
retrenchment. “Well,” he said, “I think a
beginning might be made by dismissing two of
you fellows. One can easily do the work. ”
It is printed that N.S.W. Police Inspector-
General Fosbery is to be succeeded by Col Wil
hams, now chief of N.S.W. military medical staff.
Should Mr. Fosbery retire, it would probably be
hard to find a more energetic or capable chief than
Or. Wilfiams, a born administrator who in a
wider sphere, would have climbed very high.
Julian Salomons duly appeared in wig and

Metaphor from the speech of a (Queensland
M.P. :■ —
They’ll keep cutting the wool off the sheep that lays the
s-olden en-o-s until thev pump it dry. . . The glorious
work Mil never be accomplished until the Government
properly assist the good ship Temperance to sail from one
end of the land to the other, and with a cry of victory at
each step she takes, shall plant her banner in every city,

lii his recent speech to the Phillip Division
electors Parkes's denunciations of the Ministers
nettled ’one of his listeners, who called out, “ But
weren’t they colleagues of yours . Ihe old man
arrested his flow of invective: There would be
some pertinence in that remark if it could be
shown that any one of them had ever been a col-
league of mine a second time ! ”
Parkes’s creditable achievements as an
aged parent were put into the shade by the
late Lord Tollemache, who, at SI years of age,
had a boy of 15 playing in the Eton eleven.
“Look at the power he put into t.iat ‘ off drive
and I was CG when the young scamp was born !”
the uxorious parent would say. He had chuckled
in his time over 23 new sons and a few daughters.
Parkes was Parkes to the last. When the
medical consultation took place, Dr. Money was
introduced. “ This is Dr. Angel Money, Sir
Henry,” they said. The dying old man looked
into the face of the keen-eyed physician : “ Dr.
Angel Money - you don’t look very much like an
angel, doctor.” When Dr. Ren wick called, the
veteran was too weak to say more th m : “ M y
old friend of forty, years! ”
During the conduct of a trial arising out
of a celebrated poisoning case, hold in Sydney
some time ago, counsel for accused would persist
in referring to the prisoner’s previous trial for
poisoning. This was not approved of by his
client, who from the dock sent the following note
to his attorney: “For God’s sake, keep X. off
that poisoning. ” After-events showed that prisoner
had excellent reason for his action.
The obituary article on Parkes, published
by The Argus, was mainly written years ago, nd
had since been twice brought up to date. The
man who first wrote it and the two who had to
bring it up to date are now dead ; and the man who
had to finally prepare it for publication is wonder-
ing when his turn will come. The backbone of
the S.M. Herald’s Parkes biography was
written fifteen years ago.
Maxwell, the coming Melb. advocate, has a
phiz like a common meat-axe. In the Mirams
libel-case he discoursed lengthily on “ face values.”
“ What right,” cried Purves for defendants, “has
my learned friend, with his physiognomy, to talk
about ‘ face value ’ ? What is face value ? ”
“ Cheek,” replied Maxwell, with an accent infer-
ring that his learned friend’s “ face value ” was
fabulous. Purves looked enlightened.
The octogenarian foreign nobleman now
cooking at a little Dalmorton (N.S.W.) pub., to
whom Gov. Hampden’s attention was drawn by
the surprising excellence of his omelettes, is
Count Carlo Casimir Vladislaus Batthyany,
brother of the well-known European turf-man of
that surname. He is described by the Governor
as “ an old gentleman of most polished manners,
whose brother I well knew in London. ” The Count
is quite happy so long as he can find somebody to
eat his omelettes and say they are good.
Amongst the things said of Parkes in
several papers is that during Parliamentary night
TtrL. l - n ? S n °k over-indulge in stimulants.
Which m the main is quite true, for what was
merely a gentle and healthy fillip to the old man

It According to N.S.W. Minister Carruthers,
technical and agricultural education along with
land for the people and freedom of exchange and
production must mean a glorious future for the
country. Quite so. When is it coming? Why
u'uu t it come before ? Is there any country
which hasn t been going to have a glorious future
any time within the last five centuries ? Is there
any country which isn’t still looking forward to a
glorious future ? Is there any country where the
glorious future has really arrived? What is a
glorious future, so that the country can recognise
it when it comes ; will Minister Carruthers de-
scribe it or explain what it is made of? Is the
glorious future going to be something like the
present, only more of it? About the five most
indefinite things in this world are the “ Anglo-
Saxon destiny,” and the “glorious future,” and
sound constitutional government,” and “com-
mercial and industrial freedom,” and the “crim-
son thread of kinship,” and this disreputable red
paper asks for an explanation.

“The Kitson scandal,” concerning which a
vague cable reached Australia the other day,
turned on the indiscretion of a doctor. Mrs.
Kitson met her husband in Sydney. His brother
is Sir Jarnes Kitson, head of the great breeds firm
of locomotive engineers ; and, when he took his
wife to England, his family at first showed her
every kindness. Then Arthur Kitson, the hus-
band, came out again to Australia, leaving his
wife, who was in poor health, in lodgings at
Bournenmouth. Dr. Playfair, who married a Miss
Kitson, has a world-wide reputation as an obstetric
physician, and Mrs. Kitson naturally consulted
him—some time after her husband hud left Eng-
land. He formed the suspicion that she was
enceinte ; and blurted it to Sir James Kitson, with
the result that things were made very miserable
indeed for Mrs. Arthur. Her husband came home
post-haste from Port Darwin, satisfied himself of
her innocence, and supported her in an action for
damages against Dr. Playfair. A jury gave her
<£12,000. Dr. Playfair, whose action throughout,
and especially in committing a breach of profes-
sional confidence, came in for keen criticism,
professed still to believe that his suspicion was
well-founded, but did not attempt to piove it.
Other evidence tended to show that Dr. Playfair
was decidedly wrong, and public sympathy went
strongly with Mrs. Kitson, who had been harassed
almost out of her senses.
The N.S.W. Fresh Food and Ice Co.’s
luncheon at Grafton, consequent on the opening of
the finest creamery in the province, was the biggest
success of its kind that ever took place in Austral-
asia. When the doors opened, some 600 farmers
and others poured into the large hall, and, almost
instantly, there began a great and joyous hum,
accentuated by the continual popping of corks,
and quickly giving way to the deep and sonorous
whirr of multitudinous jaws having a rare good
time. After the multitude had been fed, the
speeches began, and those reached their climax
in the vigorous and concise oration of Mr.
Pateson, the big co. ’s manager. The moment he
stood up he received a deafening ovation, far
louder and more prolonged than that accorded the
Governor and the other speakers put together.
And his speech and the speech of Mr. Mort (the
co.’s chairman) exhausted all that was worth say-
ing from a practical standpoint. Gov. Hampden
was much taken by Mr. Pateson’s speech : “ I
could listen to you till to-morrow morning, Mr.
Pateson,” he said. Of course the ex-politician
came along with his feeble and unnecessary echo
of what had already been said, and sat down with
an air of triumph after getting the usual parlia-
mentary patter off his chest, pathless, the crowd
was so happy with the luncheon and the Fresh
Food representatives’ speeches that it endured
these inflictions of words with the greatest good
humor. The Fresh Food Co. has expended
.£ll,OOO in its new buildings at Grafton ; the new
factory will make three tons of butter per day,
an 1, being right on the river’s bank, Half a ton of
butter can be put from the factory into the cold
oh amber of a vessel in two or three minutes.
Some distance out of Grafton the co. has erected a
large slaughter-house, to do business in beef and
pork, and it will also show the local farmer how
to make bacon.

THE property is situated in close proximity to
that held by Messrs. Joyce, Hopkinson and
00. (three miners’ rights), from which extraordin-
ary yields of gold have recently been obtained,
and on which the following reports have been
made by the Government geologist, Mr. Reginald
Murray, as per the Argus of January 21, 1896;
also by Mr. T. H. Smith and Mr. R. Pettigrew,
who have both inspected the property.
“ THE QUEENSTOWN REEFS.
“ A report has been furnished by Mr. Reginald
Murray, the Government geologist, to the Minister
of Mines on his recent visit to the Homeward
Bound claim at One Tree Hill, near Queenstown,
in the Plenty River district. He states that the
specimens brought in a pocket-handkerchief to the
Mines Department last week by Mr. Joyce, one
of the owners of the mine, and which he (Mr.
Murray) predicted would yield lOOoz. of gold, had
yielded 1670 z. He writes that the gold is not
merely in specks but in absolute lumps, held
together by quartz, and ‘ in all my experience I do
not remember having seen anything richer.’ The
workings where the gold was obtained are about
30ft. from the surface, and the reef varies from a
few inches in thickness to 2ft., having a north and
south strike underlying to the east. He concludes
the report by stating that active mining operations
are in progress in the district.”— Argus, 31/1/96.
“Mr. R. Murray, the Government geologist,
recently visited Queenstown, and inspected Joyce
and party’s claim at One Tree Hill. He was much
impressed with the appearance of the mine, the
richness of which is indicated by the fact that out
of one patch, 30ft. by 20ft. in extent, the lucky
prospectors have obtained no less than IOOOoz. of
gold.”—Age, 20/1/96.
The property spoken of in this prospectus is
situated about three miles from Queenstown, 27
miles from Melbourne, and adjoins the ‘ ‘ Home-
ward Bound ” on the south.
The lease comprises 30 acres. There are four
reefs running through the property.
No. 1 reef is 4|ft. wide, with good walls.
No. 2 reef is 2ft. 7in. wide, with good walls.
These two reefs have been worked out to the 150 ft.
level by the Homeward Bound, and upon inquiry
at the mine I found that it has been worked by a
party of four men, and that the returns gave from
Boz. to lOdwt. per ton. Even the latter result
would pay handsomely. They are still working
these reefs with payable results. There was an
eight-stamp mill crushing while I was there.
No. 3 reef is not opened.
No. 4 reef runs through the property. This is
the reef where the rich gold has been got lately.
It is from 4in. to 18in. wide. It is not opened on
this block of ground. A tunnel run in from a
point in the creek would cut the big reef at 26ft.,
and No. 2 reef at 41ft., and No. 3 reef at about
85ft., and No. 4 reef at 150 ft.
When asked to take shares in this mine, I said I
would not do so until I had inspected the property
myself. I did so, and have taken up a large
number of shares, and have been asked to become
a director.
I have no hesitation in recommending this as a
good investment, and I believe it will develop into
a first-class paying mine.
I cannot understand why a valuable mine of this
description has been left so long without being
opened, and it so near Melbourne.
R. PETTIGREW.
T. H. SMITH’S REPORT.
On the 30th ult. I visited the Queenstown gold-
field and made a careful inspection of the various
mines being worked, the first one visited being
Joyce and party’s claim at One-tree Hill, known
as the “Homeward Bound.” This party hold
three ordinary claims, giving them 180 ft. along
the line of reef. Two shafts have been sunk, and
in both the reef is being followed down. The
south shaft is 40ft. in depth, and, in the drive
north and south, the reef measures from 6in. to
18in. thick, and shows good gold throughout the
stone, while occasionally sensational patches are
got. About 20 tons of stone have been crushed
from this mine, giving the magnificent return of
5040 z. gold, worth over £4 per oz. Good stone is
still being raised, and the reef underfoot appears
very strong, and gives every indication of proving
permanent, the wall from the surface being hard
and clean. The reef has a slight underlay to the
east, and runs north and south.
Adjoining Joyce’s claim is an ordinary claim
held by Hartley and party. Here the reef has
also been found, and. a crushing is now being
raised, the stone being exactly the same as that in
Joyce’s claim. The next property is lease held by
Wright and King, and known as the “ South
Homeward Bound.’ 1 This lease contains about 30
acres, and Joyce s reef can be traced right into this
property, the reef running along the crown of the
hill. The hill is about 209 ft. in height, and offers
splendid facilities for mining, as a tunnel can be
driven from the eastern wall of the hill, from which
four different reefs can be worked. The first
one met with is known as the big reef. This
reef can easily be traced the entire length of the
lease, and is a true fissure reef running parallel
with Joyce’s reef, viz., north and south, and going
down almost vertical. The reef is from 3ft. to sft.
thick, lying between two clean and well-defined
walls. In one place an open cut remains, showing
where the reef was worked over 20 years ago.
From this place the stone yielded as high as 7oz.
to the ton. In the south end of this cut the reef
can be seen measuring fully 4ft. in thickness. On
the south end of the lease a shaft was sunk in the
early days to a depth of 40ft., and a quantity of
stone taken out and crushed which gave very, high
returns, but the owners had only the primitive
windlass to work with, and were unable to cope
with the water. This shaft could easily be cleaned
out and retimbered, and a large quantity Of stone
taken out for crushing at a very low cost, and I
think a whip and horse could easily beat the water
for a depth of nearly 100 ft. The second reef met
with in the tunnel is the “Moonlight,” which also
gave very rich yields when previously worked ;
and the third one is the rich reef now being so
profitably worked by Joyce and party, and which
has given the splendid yield of 250 z. per ton for 20
tons of stone.
Running along the eastern boundary of the lease
is Femtree dully, the whole length of which
yielded very rich gold in the early days of the
field, nuggets of over lOOoz. having been got in the
creek, and as the big reef can be easily traced
running parallel with, and only a few yards from,
this creek, it is reasonable to suppose that this
rich alluvial gold was shed from the big reef. At
the mouth of the shaft sunk on the big reef some
very nice-looking stone is to be seen carrying iron
pyrites and galena—sure indications of payable
country. Another reef worked in the early days
on this lease is known as the Swedish Reef, and
from this reef very rich returns were obtained, and
it is safe to assume that this reef would also be
met with in the tunnel. A splendid site can be
obtained for a battery on the lease, and a dam
could be easily constructed to supply water for
crushing purposes, while an abundant supply of
timber for all purposes can be got on the mine. In
conclu ion, I have no hesitation in stating that the
big reef is the main line of reef in the Queenstown
district, and firmly believe that it will be profit-
ably worked to very great depths, as with the
many advantages of cheap mining that are to be
had in this district a very low average can be
made to pay.
In conclusion, I may state that after many
years’ experience in mining in the different colo-
nies, I have never seen such a splendid property
lying idle, and can safely say that if such a pro-
perty were in the remote parts of North Queens-
land or Western Australia, where the expenses of
working would be so very much greater, this pro-
perty would not be allowed to remain unde-
veloped.—Yours faithfully, T. H. SMITH.

Bookies are practising their early tug-catching
game as usual. People in adjacent provinces are circular-
ised ; a forecast given of what will be nominated for Melb.
Oup, and the odds stated against each. Most of the
mentioned neddies are either being used as hacks, turned
out, or dead. Some mugs, “ honored ” with a personal
letter, fall in. Innocents are always abroad.

The shocking display made by Duke of Rich-
mond in S.A.J.C. St. Leger disconcerted his new owner,
who gave £5OO for him. He was over 20 lengths off The
Merry Boy. The colt is brother to Lord Richmond and
Broken Hill.

That first-class sprinter, Mostyn, failed to
annex S.A.J.C. Goodwood six furlongs for the third suc-
cessive year. Tinstream, the winner, who outheaded
O’Shannassy’s Homespun, is local bred, and managed to
keep the foreigners out. She started third top-weight
and paid a surprise div. of £l9 odd. In six years she has
scored 16 times, and got 27 places.

The ,£l9 10s. tote div. on Tinstream’s Good-
wood win would have been an Ikey Mo 6 to 1.

Warpaint’s dead-heat with Hova (he lost the
decider) in Elder Stakes, under equal weights, shows
what a notoher he is when fit. As a four-year-old, he
dead-heated his rival for second behind the sensational
Titan in V.R.O. (Nov.) Railway Handicap, conceding the
now champion 221 b.
How fortune rings in her changes on lucky
stables ! On top of Wallace’s bruised heel came the lame-
ness of Challenger and Pilatus on the eve of their Mor-
phetville engagements. The fine Challenger was favorite
for the Goodwood, and the ring didn’t miss him when
scratched.
A couple of moneyed Maorilanders have secured
a fair heap about Tire for next Derby and Cup. This tear-
away youngster belongs to a galloping family, hut, apart
from that fact, Spring classic probabilities can’t be well
gauged, in any case, until after the cold season.
Dan. O’Brien again retiring from the turf. A

Australian chess-champion Wallace (whose por-

A glance at the Royal Stakes and Birthday Cup
imposts shows a tendency to construct on the flattering
principle. Several apparently turned-loose neddies figure
in both. So far as the Cup is concerned, a great deal will,
as usual, depend upon sweep men coming up with the
stable bit to nix. “No whack, no jig.” Under ordinary
circs., Valiant, Fort, True Blue, and Gaulus seemed en-
dowed with winning chances, and if a light-weight scores
it will probably be the unlucky 6.10 Cradle, who is quite
capable of rocking over a mile and a half.
Dear Bulletin, — “ The tote never asks for odds
on but takes your money and pays a div.” Although the
tote always pays a div. yet the result is often odds-on. At
Onkaparinga, Disparity, winner of the Hill Railway Handi-
cap, paid £1 18s. div., i.e., started at 10 to 9 on. Numer-
ous similar instances are quotable.—Trim.

A weekly writer wonders why the Duke of Port-
land, and other big Hinglish owners interested in Aus.
turf, don’t send out some of their prads. When Melb.
Cup is ten thou, again, and bookies guarantee not to go
“ stony,” the Duke and Co. might be tempted. Cash
plums always entice people who don’t need ’em.
# * * *
There are stacks of money in the surreptitiously-
run Melb. “totes.” Last week two men were fined £lOO
for running one in Collingwood. That tote has already
paid £4OO in fines. It seetns to be squarely conducted,
has a wide-spread, clean reputation, and men, women
and children tramp miles to put on their sixpences.

Coolgardie expects to entice Adelaide and Perth
neddies with a £lOOO meet. The one-time camel-race and
well-worn Publicans’ Purse are omitted from the pro-
gramme.
* * * *
The St. Albans double seems to be the favorite
public pick for all big meets. And it will likely be more
fashionable than ever at Derby and Cup-time.
* * * *
Horse-reporters talk of Auraria suffering the
fate of several previous Cup winners that did nothing
afterwards. But the mare has already followed up her
Cup victory by capturing the V.R.C. Oaks, and dividing
a stake with Wallace. Patron, Tarcoola, Glenloth and
Malvolio didn’t score one win after taking the big stake.

The M.L. amateur walker, A. Brady, has re-
duced the 2-mile record to 14 min. 12 3-sth sec., or 54 2-sth
sec. better than previous best time.
* » * *
A Melb. small-course owner is imitating Caul-
field Oakleigh Plate and Purse divided-handicap idea. A
fair scheme for separating the sheep from the goats. How
would a divided Melb. Cup go ? Run the field in three
sets—first-class, medium, and cronk or blocking crowd.
By way of diversion the three in each could race off
for the total place money. Ridiculous, of course. But
the best neddy would have a much better show than here-
tofore, unless Ikey Mo winded him with a shot-gun as he
was coining up the straight.
The keen interest in racing manifested by Gov.
Hampden has set people wondering w'hy he doesn’t flash
colors on a neddy of his own. “ Guv’ment Brand ”
wouldn’t be a bad name for it.

A “lydies”’ cricket-match at Narracoorte(S.A.)

Says the New York World’s London corres-
pondent : —“ Almost any afternoon, between 4 and 5
o’clock, may be seen walking down the Strand the wreck
of what was once one of the greatest fighting-men the
world has ever seen. As the powerful figure swings along,
the massive shoulders a trifle stooped, the mighty hands
hanging listless, the eyes glazed and fixed straight ahead,
the crowd part respectfully, for he is one of the most
popular men in London. They look after him until he
disappears, and then they shake their heads regretfully
and mutter, ‘ I say, but. ain’t it a blooming shame ; poor
old Jackson.’ Down in Texas, where all the pugilists are
gathering, a sigh of relief will go up when the news comes
that Peter Jackson will never again put up his hands in
the roped arena. With the exception of his eyes and a
certain flabbiness and laxity of movement, Jackson’s
London life has left slight marks on him. Alcohol
has not swollen his face, and his cheeks have still the old,
lean, drawn look, while the high cheek - bones which
usually go with the combative temperament are as pro-
minent as ever. It is only when he talks or when he
moves around that the change in him is noticed. Some-
times when he lifts his glass his big hands shake a little,
and there is a curious halt now and then in his speech,
as if he were groping for something he could not find.
Although he has no occupation, Jackson has plenty of
money. He dresses in the very latest fashion, and from
the crown of his highly-polished silk hat to the soles of his
patent-leather shoes he is a model of correct attire.”
* * * *
Dear Bulletin, —A rash paragrapliist supposes
that “ the brothers Manifold find honesty a non-paying
policy ” because their horse Apsley was heavily handi-
capped after winning four hurdle races in succession, in-
cluding a Grand National at Flemington. What nonsense !
Owners can’t get rich by losing races (although street-
corner mugs may call them clever), and when they pull
off a sequence of wins with a good animal they expect
him to be penalised accordingly. Apsley, by the way,
wasn’t crushed with “ impossible burdens” after enjoying
his picnic; for I remember him running a very close
seoond for another handicap at Flemington. Honesty is
the best policy to adopt with the best horses. Carbine
won a fortune in handicap stakes alone for Donald
Wallace, whilst a certain much “ messed-about ” star
was barely paying training expenses.—F.
“Charley ” Thompson, an alleged English “gen-
tleman ” jock., who has been warned off the turf for sus-
picious riding of his horse Bouncing Boy, is the proprietor
of a number of millinery-shops all over London, and
trades as “Madame Louise”; for which reason he is
known to his pals as “ Bonnety Ben.” He is a fine horse-
man, able to give pounds to the majority of amateurs,
and ought to have managed better than he did, for his
performance was so clumsy that one is almost inclined to
believe his defence, “ he was trying to cut it fine, and got
done by a head.” However, the disqualification of one of
the gentlemen will do a world of good (says Tup. Bulle-
tin’s correspondent), for, taking them all round, they are
about as crooked as you make ’em, and quite put pro-
fessionals in the shade for downright roguery.

The folly of investing on city totes is only
apparent to some of the frequently-bitten victims. A
large proportion of the entrants never start, and are
scratched on the ground. The cash planked on them in
pure ignorance usually goes into the “ runner’s ” pocket.
He pays a div. on the remainder, less commission, and if
something extra is also absorbed backers never know any-
thing about it.
One tote man runs his own little printing-office,
issuing his ’krect card, odds list, past divs., &c., daily.
A sporting Maori backed his we'Ay Carbine
against a neighbor’s unpretentious crock. Slake : a foal
each. He lost his foal. Then he offered an it.her go, this
time for a pig. He lost his pig. Allowed a concession,
he next raced horse for horse, winner taking both. He
lost his horse. One night he stole all his losses back.
Then he got three months for stealing the wrong pig.
A Sydney man, passed out lately, produced a
bookie to evidence that he backed his neddy when it
didn’t win, and didn’t when it did. As the owner had
some time previously informed a couple of the stewards
that this very ringman had “ financed ” him, they dis-
counted the testimony. The little moral is : when a
bookie happens to be your “ uncle ” keep the pawn-ticket
locked up.

The Parkes family is widely scattered in
death. Some of the ex-Premier’s children are
buried in St. Paul’s churchyard, Birmingham
(Eng.), others in the old Sandhills cemetery, Bel-
more Road, Sydney. His first wife is in the little
plot at Faulconbridge, where also lies a sister,
whom the old man for many years maintained.
In this same plot are his son Robert and Robert’s
wife, whose orphan children the old man also
maintained, and last week by special request
Parkes’s own remains were interred in that same
spot. Parkes’s second wife, who died some months
ago, rests in the cemetery at Ryde on the Parra-
matta River—by, it is understood, her own special
request.
The first number of the new series of
Cosmos is really admirable typographically, and
the pictures make it a splendid sixpenn’orth, but
it’s to be hoped the conductors will lighten and
brighten its dull, heavy contents. There are
exceptions, of course : Louise Mack’s serial story
seems to be strengthening, though it is difficult to
judge at monthly intervals ; and one or two other
good points appear. But, on the whole, Cosmos
fails to be interesting with a large and portentous
failure. A new feature is the monthly issue to
subscribers of songs by Henri Kowalski, full
music size, for a small additional subscription.
Cecil Rhodes has been clean bowled out :
“Dr. Jim’s” raid on the Transvaal was, it has
been clearly proved, the outcome of a scheme
shared in by him, as shown by cipher cables, the
code of which was found on Jameson when he
surrendered. The Times admits Rhodes’s guilt,
but an attempt is made in the Australian press to
whitewash Csesar on the plea that it is impossible
that so careful a man as Rhodes would let himself
be caught so simply. Which is the plea advanced
on behalf of every particularly intelligent and in-
fluential thief and murderer who happens to find
himself behind the spikes.
Bertha Clair, a young woman, was charged
at Melbourne with insulting behaviour—con-
sisting in appearing in the street on Eight
Hours’ day in male attire. ‘ ‘ Why do not the
police arrest all the cyclistes in ‘ rational ’ cos-
tume?” asked Bertha’s lawyer. The P.M.
advised Miss Clair to stick to skirts for the future,
and dismissed the case. Evidently the policeman’s
view of what constitutes a male costume is in pro-
cess of revolution. A woman can now dress as
much like a man as she cares to, above the knee,
but the calf must not be disguised. Woman can
take on anything but the ordinary male bags, and
Man, poor proud Man, flatters himself that his
trousers are still his own, blind to the fact that the
time is rapidly approaching when he will be prose-
cuted for wearing ’em.
A summary of the results of S.A. general
elections: —
With the exception of Kingston, who was headed by a
friendly candidate by 6 votes, the members Of the Govt,
topped' the poll in their districts in each case by large
majorities, and whilst every member of the Labor-party
in last Assembly was re-elected, the Labor nominees were
successful in three other districts. Of the Ass party in
last Assembly Glynn, Packham, H. E. Downer, Howe,
Randell, Hawker, Riddoch and Short were badly beaten,
and one or two other Ass M’sP. were only re-elected by
small majorities. The most noteworthy defeats were
those of squatter Riddoch, displaced by jour-
nalist Morris, a strong democrat; Howe, one of the
leaders of the Ass party,' who was defeated by Roberts, a
direct Labor candidate ; and 11. E. Downer, brother of the
Opposition leader, also beaten by a Labor man, Carpenter,
As expected by The Bulletin, the Thistle crowd received
its biggest defeats in the provincial centres. S.A. pro-
ducers are beginning to see through the hypocrisy of the
ring of Adelaide monopolists who did their utmost in last
Parliament to frustrate many measui-es of genuine advan-
tage to the farmers, but the imbecile proposals of the Ass
to abolish free education and payment of members gave
that animal clean away with the country electors, who
have been crying out for local representation for years,
and who saw that non-payment meant a return to the old
system of country constituencies being ridden by metro-
politan Fat Men. Altogether the Govt, will have a work-
ing majority in the new Assembly of at least a dozen, and
asThe Democrats already have a majority in the Council,
the Kingston Ministry should be safe for another three
years.
THE SAME OLD STORY-
“Oh, it’s the same old story ; no u f e
cussing it; it’s like ‘ the everlasting 1( h ~
Rule for Ireland, Freetrade and I rotection ;
discussion never ends to the satisfaction of either .
81 ‘‘I don’t know,” quietly replied my ( companion
as he leaned over the steamers side,
question is one so momentous to tie m m
and the nation that it becomes a duty m each
to try and solve the problem !
“ People will drink—you can’t get away irom
that,” I answered.
“I don’t want to get away from human nature ,
that’s the mistake philosophers make ; but, start-
ing with the fact that people will drink, there
seems to me an easy solution of the question.
“ Indeed ! ” I smiled incredulously.
“ Yes ! to supply to people the best liquor at the
lowest price.” ,
“ If you could find some philanthropist to bear
the expense ! ”
“ I shouldn’t start it on philanthropy, but on
principles of business economy, by bringing tie
consumer into direct contact with the exporter ! ,
“ Do away with the middle-man wine-merchant s
profits ? ” I queried.
“ Precisely ! ”
“ But there can’t be any profit in that, or it
would have been done before.’
“Well, it is being done in Melbourne by a great !
London firm of wine and spirit exporters.
‘ ‘ Their name ? ” .
“ Shepherd and Co., Ltd. They have taken in
Manchester Lane fine large premises, with three
floors and about 3C,oooft. of cellar-space, probably
the largest in Melbourne. They’ve had the whole
place furnished and refitted under Salway, the
architect’s, direction. I went over the premises
the day before we left Melbourne. You should
see the cellars ; it would make your mouth water !
“ It does,” I said, drily.
“ What will you drink ? ” he laughed.
“Oh ! I’ll follow out your principles ; the best
they’ve got—say champagne ! ”
“ What brand do you like? ”
“I’ll leave that to you,” I said, not wishing to
display my merely nodding - acquaintance with
champagne.
“ Well, G. H. Mumm & Co.’s is the best! ”
“You mean you like it best? ”
“No ! not only myself. Look here ; you’ll ad-
mit the Americans understand what is good in the
matter of drinks ! ”
“ I believe so.”
“Well, I can assure you, as a fact, that accord-
ing to the statistics of champagne imported into
the United States for 1895, G. H. Mumm and Co.
are credited with nearly as much as Pommery and
Greno, Moet and Chandon, Heidseck and Co. —all
these firms put together.”
“ Let’s go below ; quick ! here’s comes my wife;
you’ll be careful ? ”
“ I understand ; ‘ Mumm’s ’ the word ! ”
“The Americans both understand what is good
and practise it,” I said, as we regained the deck.
“ They do.” His wife came along.
* * * *
Later in the day I met him. “ Come and
have a whisky with me,” I said, emphasising the
word whisky, as I couldn’t run to champagne.
“ What brand? ” I asked, as one asks of an expert.
“John Robertson’s, ” he said, and his answer made
me glad. I’ve always drunk J.R.D., and I was
pleased to know on his authority I had not been
wasting good drinking-time.
“ Other whiskies may come and go,” he said
sagely, “ but John Robertson’s stands the test of
time and competition.”
That night, over coffee, he introduced me to a
glass of delicious cognac brandy, and I wrote
down for future reference the name of the brand,
“A. C. Meukhow & Co.” Seeing I was interested
in drink, generally and specifically, he returned to
the subject of Shepherd and Co.’s new enterprise.
“ There’s one thing they’ve decided firmly on,
and that is that they will not touch colonial dis-
tillations at all. If their customers want Colonial
spirits they must get them elsewhere. When you
go back to Melbourne you should call on the firm
and see thoir premises. One fact that may interest
you as a Victorian is that they import all their
spirits in the wood, and the bottling, labelling,
and casing will distribute about £lO,OOO a-year
among Melbourne artisans and general workers.”
“Shepherd and C 0.,” he proceeded, “ as they
are direct representatives here, for their own sakes
can only afford to take such firms as have estab-
lished reputations— e.g., their ports and sherries
they receive from Sandeman, Sons and Co. San-
deman, the head of this firm, is a present Governor
of the Bank of England. Their pure Jamaica
rum comes from Lamb and Sons, and their un-
sweetened gin from Vickers and Co., distillers to
the Queen. They do not bottle their Guinness’
stout here; that is done in London by Daukes
and Co. ; and Heineken’s Lager beer (Pilsener
and Bavarian) is imported bottled. They keep in
their cellars, too, Scotia’s Pride (Bruce Bros and
Co.), O’Grady’s Old Irish (Dublin) whisky' and
Don Carlos port and sherry.”
“ I should like to pay them a visit of about a
week s duration !
“You’ll find it worth your while, and they’ll be
pleased to see you.”
“I suppose it took some time to start such a
business?
“Not long ! The gentleman who is now the
manager of the company in Melbourne left for
Englandtocxmfer with his principals on 7th Sept
1890, and after six weeks in England and on the
Continent, where he came into contact with all
the great distillers and bottlers, he completed his
export arrangements and reached Melbourne on
mh Dec ’95. On 20th Jan., ’96, the business
was launched.
“Prettv quick work; I’d like to meet that

GENERAL DEBILITY
and Indigestion
Made Her Life Miserable, but She is
Cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Read the testimony of Mrs. E. G.
Monro, Coburg, Victoria, whose por-
trait is also given:
E
“Some few years ago I suffered
terribly with indigestion and gen-
eral debility. I could not sleep,
and my condition was such as to
make my life miserable. None of
the many remedies I tried did me
any good, and I despaired of ever
getting better. One of my friends
told me of the blood-purifying and
strength-giving properties of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and I began taking it.
Before 1 had finished the first bottle
I felt better, and was thus encour-
aged to give the medicine a thorough
trial: In all I used four bottles,
and then was perfectly cured of the
grievous trouble which had afflicted
me. 1 now recommend, to anyone
suffering as I did.

The accident whereby a young girl was
killed through the snapping of a davit on board a
Sydney excursion steamer, the other day, calls to
mind a similar case at a Scotch watering-place a
few years ago. As usual, a couple of officious
passengers took the place of the deck-hands when
lowering the boat, which was let down at a terrific
pace, giving the occupants a ducking and severely
maiming two children who were unconcernedly
looking over the side on the lower deck. At the
subsequent investigation the action of the pas-
sengers was considered censurable, but the s.s.
Co. was held fully responsible and mulct in heavy
damages. The co. disclaimed all liability for a
traveller’s action ; but, on being asked if they
Would not prevent a passenger taking hold of the
wheel, they, of course, replied in the affirmative,
which gave their case away. A rope is as much
part of a ship as a wheel.
The following, taken from Otago Witness
(M.L.), is one of the reasons why The Bulletin
votes for cremation :
A little above the south end of the Avenue of Foxton
sits upon the grassed slopes of the sandhills the small
cemetery of the village. Inside that enclosure is another
little blue and white one, and down under the flowers
growing between the sea shells strewn there lies in an
everlasting sleep all that was once Flo. Marie, for the tiny
marble up here saj's : “In loving memory of Florence
Marie May, who joined the angels to day.” Then the
date follows, and after that the touching intimation,
“ Jesus loves me.” Flo. Marie died a bridesmaid, and
this was the tale : The wedding-party—bride and brides-
maid (Flo. Marie), bridegroom and groomsman, parson
and friends and all—were there. The ceremony over,
bride and bridegroom kissed the smiling bridesmaid lean-
ing against a wall ; but it wasn’t Flo. Marie it was only
her clay. The Reaper had come and smiled on the
floweret. This is death. That was many years ago.
Any kind of change which will prevent the public
maundering over the tomb of Little Eva and such
things must be a change for the better. The
trouble doesn’t lie so much in the weeping of the
deceased’s relatives ; it is the unauthorised person
who insists on snuffling sadly over other people
whom he never saw before, simply because they
are buried, that is objectionable.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
quyer of all other Australian gems.*
Truth again distancing fiction. In the
Lebaudy scandal, France, evidence is given that a
consumptive girl was brought from Marseilles to
kill Lebaudy, and she is produced before the tri-
bunal.

In one case, when three hunters and trappers

the Rose River, one was taken very ill; his mates
intended taking him in a waggon to Wangaratta
(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next

Canning Mills, Canning, Western Australia.
To Herr Rassmussen,
I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Lock Cure Pills completely cured me of a very
bad disease. Previous to taking your Lock Pills,
I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You
are authorised to publish this testimonial.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

a sufferer from General Debility of the Nervous
System for over seven years, and having tried
without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your

A new thing in mouse-shifting and rat-
hustling is a phosphorescent terra-cotta cat, which
gleams grimly just by the rat or mouse-hole, and
ights up the pantry wondrously and fearsomely.
-Also, it induces sobriety on lodge-nights.
R.A. President Leighton is said to have
left no property beyond his furniture and effects,
even if his household goods are not encroached
upon by his liabilities. He was not a prolific
painter, and he lived high.
There is not much sympathy with Italy
amongst the strong Roman Catholics, who see the
hand of God in the late defeat of the Italians, and
lay stress upon the fact that the Abyssinian forces
were actually armed with old Papal weapons
which had been sold to them by the Italians
themselves.
A GRAND LITERARY INSTITUTION.
Cole s Book Arcade now runs from the centre
of the block in Bourke-street to the centre of the

literary and artistic : 1, New Books ; 2, Second-
hand Books ; 3, Stationery ; 4, Music ; 5, Fancy
Goods ; 6, Toys ; 7, Perfumery; 8, Pictures ; 9,

11, a Japanese Exhibition ; 12, a Wonderland ;
13, a Smiling Gallery; 14, a Child’s Picture
Gallery ; 15, a Bargain Room ; 16, a Tea Room ;
17, a splendidly arranged new Wholesale Book
Department, containing half-a-million books. The

long. *
John Grice distinguished himself on the
question of lady resident practitioners at Melb.
Hospital. Grice thought that the feelings of the
patients ought to be considered ; “ moreover, many
of them were suffering from diseases which, to say
the least, it would be very hard for lady doctors to
illustrate before a mixed class of pupils of the
same age as themselves.” Good Griceous ! Every
third patient in the Hospital is a woman, and, if
another woman can’t illustrate Tier case to a mixed
class with more propriety than a young man can
do the same thing, The Bulletin would like to
know the reason why.

E. B. Loughran, a Yic. poet who recently
issued a volume of verse and failed to ignite the
Yarra, discovers that he experienced a calamity in
having been born a poet. The successes of ‘ ‘ Banjo ”
and Lawson trouble him muchly. “ If,” he wails,
“ with an ear for jingle the rhymster combines the
slany of horse-racing with some knowledge of the
shady side of bush life, and has digested his Kip-
ling to the point of assimilation, he may produce a
book of verse that will run into three editions, but
if he has ‘ the vision and the faculty divine,’ if he
has seen ‘ the light that never was on land or sea,’
and attempts to deliver a message, then ”
well then he suffers neglect, like Kendall, Gordon
—and Loughran. If Mr. Loughran’s compara-
tive failure had not induced envy and un-
charitableness, he would admit that the bards he
inferentially contemns had made their marks be-
fore ever Kipling appeared above the horizon. But
much criticism of Australian stuff in Australia has
not yet risen superior to the bald insinuation con-
tained in an allusion to Bret Harte, or Swinburne,
or Kipling. It is not even counted to the verse-
maker’s credit that he imitated Kipling before
Kipling was.

are divided into five different camps, and we hate
one another with a holy hatred. If one camp
wants to borrow a plough, the other refuses until
almost coerced thereto by a threat of civil war.
In fact, our sole aim appears to be to make it un-

Oddment posted on the Melb. telegraph-
posts last week: “If men and women would
banish beer, gambling, and other vices, and save
their badly-spent money to defeat their employers,
they could rule the labor-market and swamp the
unemployed difficulty. They might become wives
and husbands, instead of prostitutes and bludgers.

“ A plague of flies and mosquitoes is ravag-
ing the Northern Territory,” writes a Bulletin
correspondent. “They follow cattle in millions,
and drive them into frenzy. The other day a bush-
man had one of his horses killed by the pests,
and fearing to lose the other, covered it with
a coating of thin paint to which a little carbolic
had been added. This device was completely suc-
cessful.” Was it? It ought to have killed the
horse.

A Case for the Psychologist,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In this age of the neurotic and erotic female, it
is generally a woman’s own fault if she finds her-
self in weird situations; yet it may occasionally
happen that an innocent and sensitive girl un-
avoidably undergoes a cruel embarrassment such
as only fellow women can appreciate—or old
doctors like myself. Let me put it into proper
story-form for you. She told me—she had to tell
somebody.
It was her first day up, and she was lying on a
couch in the drawing-room, where the sunlight,
mellowed by its passage through the yellow art-
muslin curtains, touched her here and there with
vague spots of light. A mere girl in appearance
(though worn with recent illness), she was yet
looking back on five years of married life. Such
happy years—she was thinking in that acutely-
emotional frame of mind that comes with the
weakness of convalescence. From the very first
he had changed the world for her. On the evening
she had acknowledged his bow of introduction,
the reserved, timid girl had given her heart to the
bright, alert young fellow with the cheery smile
and frank, pleasant ways—given it with a secret
shame and self-reproach which the matron of five
years’ standing could almost smile to recall. But
all that was over now, over like the terrible illness
through which she had passed—happy wife, happy
mother, listening for her husband’s foot upon the
threshold . . . and Ethel, her little four-year child
—was that her voice singing among the laurel
bushes beyond the verandah ?
The yellow curtains swelled inward, moved by
the gently-rising breeze; she was falling into a
doze again when there was a sound of voices.
“ She is on the sofa. You can go in. I’ll be
with you presently.”
The door opened.
She awoke with a start. “ How long you’ve
been, dear; I’ve had such a nice sleep ! Are
those pansies for me? Yes, lay them on the
table ; mother will bring in a bowl for them pre-
sently.” She pushed back the hair from her fore-
head and looked up at him smilingly. “ How
nice you look, Frank ! I’m afraid it will be a
long time before I get my good looks back again.
Poor, dear fellow,” and she stroked his cheek
pityingly, “it would be an awful shame for a
beauty-loving man like you to be saddled with
an ugly wife.”
“ Yes—no—it doesn’t matter ! ”
“ Doesn’t it ? Well, you needn’t get so red
about it. Can’t you sit still with me a little
while ! Where are you going ? ”
“ I thought—perhaps you’d like to see your
mother.” And through his mind flashed : “ I must
take care what I say; she couldn’t bear a shock
just now.”
“Oh ! thank you,” with playful petulance ;
“ I’ve had mother all morning ; I should like a
little of my husband’s society just for a change.
How do you think the old home’s looking ? Not
so nice as our own little house, of course, but the
country air will be so good for Ethel after the heat
of Sydney. Do you know, Frank, I can never
understand how we came to have such a handsome
child ; neither of us is very good-looking, you
know—at least you aren’t; yet there she is the
frettiest little girl in Sydney. Other people say so;
didn’t.”
Her quick mood changed from playfulness to
pathos. “ I’ve been thinking of the days we first
met ; she was lying back once more, her hands
beneath her head, looking up at him with that
perfect sense of possession that scorns the added
assurance of touch or caress ; “ you’ve been very
kind to me—all these years. I was fond of my
father and mother, but my love for you is quite
different.”
A movement at the door. Her gaze had
wandered as she spoke the last few words; now
she raised herself abruptly in her astonishment:
he had stolen softly from her side, and was stand-
ln§[ by the door, his hand raised to open it.
Her cheek flushed. “Frank,” she said, pite-
o’isly; “ why are you leaving me like that?” . . .
How strange you look ! ”
She sprang from the sofa, and, tottering in her
weakness, stood holding fast to the back of a chair.
“ Don’t—don’t look like that.” A quick pallor
overspread her features ; she was conscious of a
sick despair, of a striving to grasp something—un-
derstand something— what, she did not know. Then
she felt his arm round her, and with a sigh of
relief, even a faint smile, she sank back on the
sofa—sitting, this time, her head against the wall.
"No wonder you looked strange, Frank. Why,
I’ve actually been thinking of Ethel as a little
girl, when she’s only a baby—a little baby in long
clothes. It must be the effect of my illness, I
suppose !”
“ Yesj of course”—hurriedly; “now, sit still,
while I call your mother ! ”
“ ‘ Sit—-still—while—I—call—your— mother.’
Frank ! ” She pressed her hands to her forehead,
and rose slowly to her feet, looking not at him,
but at the wall opposite. “ Why am I repeating
your _ words like this ? Oh ! there’s something
slipping away from me! Save me, Frank, don’t
let it—my mind’s travelling backwards, back-
wards.”
“Oh !” in a tone of piercing horror : “ I never
had a child. . . . Oh, my God, what have I
been saying to you ? . . . You are Mr. Frank
Allison, and I have met you only once before ! ”
“That’s all. Curious, isn’t it? Given a sudden
love-emotion, followed by a severe illness with its
accompaniment of delirious dreaming, and there
you have the anticipations of the future tem-
porarily assuming the reality of the past.”
“ But, look here, how did it end ? Surely he
had the decency to fall in love with her after
that. ”
“ My dear fellow, he had the hardest job to win
her after that. The purest woman can’t easily
endure the idea that her forward-looking thoughts
have been self-revealed to the man she loves,
especially before he has declared himself.”
“ But how did it end ? ”
“ Well, I saw her just the other day. She has
everything now —the loving husband, the little
house in town, the annual visit to her mother’s
that ‘ Ethel ’ may enjoy the fresh air, only .”
“ Only what ? ”
The old Doctor looked up with a twinkle in his
eye.
“ One thing went wrong. ‘ Ethel ’is a boy ! ”
Maoriland,
C. CLYDE.
A recent suicide at Hawera (M.L.) is a
whole essay on the illogicalness of woman. The
deceased, who was aged 17, consulted a fortune-
teller, who told her she would die when between
19 and 20. The prospect of dying two years hence
preyed on her mind so much that she went and
died at once; or rather, she killed herself to
avoid death.
The "Provisional School,"
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was built in the “humpy” style of
architecture—sapling frame-work covered with
stringy-bark—and stood on a rather steep siding
where the earth had been dug away to give the
building a chance of holding on. The “ face ” of
the excavation was level with the eaves, and a
boy might have stepped from the edge on to the
log weights of the roof. There was but one room,
about 24 x 16 feet, and a little “skillion ” below
the surface at the back for the accommodation of
the master, who was a bachelor then. Seen along
the “siding,” the humpy seemed to be leaning
well into the hillside, as it afraid of slipping down
into the main road and being run over by the
traffic. This hut was called a “ provisional ”
school, and we connected the word vaguely with
tucker.
* * * *
One of the master’s pet notions was that
the hut.might be blown down at any moment in a
high wind—greatly to the anger and disgust of
the bushman who built it—and he trained the
scholars to dive under the desks at a given signal,
so that, in case the worst happened, they might
escape the falling rafters. We were privately
resolved to dive for the door at the first warning
crack.
* * * *
The fittings consisted of part of the worn-
out furniture of a neighboring town school. The
books came second-hand from the same school.
They had been, according to the title-page, “ pub-
lished for use in the public schools of Ireland,”
and were mostly about Ireland. The “master”
was Irish, too. We had one “geography,” which
hinted vaguely of a large unexplored continent
called New Holland, and said: “ The inhabitants
of New Holland are amongst the lowest and most
degraded to be found on the surface of the earth.”
We remember that this sentence always impressed
us greatly when he ran against it —because of the
roll of it, no doubt. Furthermore, the volume
stated that some of the poorer inhabitants of
Norway made a kind of bread out of the inner
bark of a (sort of tree) —which so exasperated a
certain hairy ex-viking ; who had settled there,
that he withdrew his children from the school and
taught them at home.
The book contained several other cheerful and
interesting statements, which the children never
doubted. “It’s in the book,” they said ; and that
clinched it. We hadn’t begun to doubt the news-
papers then. The reading books, with moral little
stories—with the scenes laid in the vicinity of
Athlone—about the small and very ragged
children of extremely poor and doggedly
honest parents, and ladies at the “great house,”
and “the squire” who occasionally distributed
pennies ; and the moral of most of them was that
it is better to be ragged and starved and in danger
of being run in for vagrancy than to be rich and
discontented. We believed it all then—but we
doubt now. We believed in and took for granted
many things which we don’t believe now. Ah,
for the faith of childhood! The master was
always right then, the elders of the district were
right, and print was infallible.
* * * *
A big, easy-going iguana had his head-
quarters in the hollow of a tree near the school-
house. We called him “Stripes,” because of the
black and yellow rings round his tail. He might
have been a “she,” but “he” seemed to fit him
better. We always oalled an animal “he ” when
doubtful of the gender. “ Stripes ” was under the
master’s protection, and well the wily lizard knew
it. He’d camp about the “ rislers ” and logs of
the roof on sunny days; and sometimes, during
school-hours, he’d come in through a hole in the
bark and He along on a tie-beam over the girls’
seat, and think and doze, and improve his mind,
or refresh it, maybe—for he looked as if his educa-
tion had begun before man started his—and blink
at the master, and at last be droned fast to sleep
by the children’s voices.
And sometimes one of the boys would watch his
chanoe to whisper hoarsely :
“ Gur-r-rls ! —the gohanna’s failin’ 1 ”
Then you’d hear the girls squawk.
* * * *
There has been a brick public school there
for many years, and masters of the new school, and
new systems.
H.L.
Says Sue, in Thos. Hardy's “Jude the
Obscure ” : —“ I have no fear of men, as such, nor
of their books. I have mixed with them—one or
two of them particularly—almost as one of their
own sex. I mean I have not felt about them as
most women are taught to feel—to be on their
guard against attacks on their virtue; for no
average man—no man short of a sensual savage—
will molest a woman by day or night, at home or
abroad, unless she invites him. Until she says by
a look ‘ come on ’ he is always afraid to, and if
you never say it, or look it, he never comes.”
“You and your comrades made me feel
that Australasia is one in its devotion to the in-
terests of the Army—the salvation of the world,
loyalty to the principles of the Army, and affection
for the ‘ General. ’ May it continue and increase
until we meet before the Throne. ” —Booth’s letter
to the Harmy leader in Melbourne. They all
seem to take it for granted that the Almighty has
a throne— also a crown and sceptre. The religious
conception of a King of Kings breathes the most
vulgar spirit of worldly grovel. No wonder Queen
Victoria is Defender of the Faith, and bishops sit
in the House of Lords, and Albert Edward pre-
tends to say his prayers. Good old faith !
Jameson’s downfall, over the inglorious
Transvaal filibustering expedition, has proved a
blessing in disguise to the British S. Africa Co.,
whose affairs he administered locally, and the very
best thing that could have happened to ensure the
co. ’s safety in Matabeleland. After the defeat and
capture of the little Scotch medico and his forces
at Kriigersdorp, the Chartered Co., fearing an
attack on its territory by the Boers in retaliation
for “Dr. Jim’s” impudent aggression, sent out
secret agents to enlist soldiers for the defence of
Buluwayo. These agents travelled all over the
Cape and S. Africa, and succeeded in gathering
together a fine body of ex-soldiers, who were paid
at the rate of 12s. 6d. per day and promised £1
per diem when on active service. Hundreds of
able-bodied men were in this way quietly smuggled
into Buluwayo, and, after being equipped, dis-
tributed all over the co.’s territory. The Char-
tered Co., whose regular forces had been disbanded
after the slaughter of Lo Bengula’s warriors, was
thus well prepared for attack —a circumstance for
which it has solely to thank Jameson’s downfall.
The bolt, however, came from where it was least
expected. The Matabeles “revolted,” and the
Boers, for whose reception elaborate systems of
defence had been undertaken, magnanimously
offered to send help to the co. in order to protect
the women and children in laager at Buluwayo.

At Night.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The night is young yet : an enchanted night
In early Summer —soft, calm, cool, and bright.
The moonlight fills the sleeping valley up,
Like white wine poured into a earven cup.
I love the Night! I love each little breeze
She brings to charm the sleep of dreaming trees.
I like her Moon, the theme of countless rhymes
(I’ve written some of these, myself, at times).
The Night has noises. Sough! Susurrus! Hark
’Tis Mother Nature whispering in the dark.
Burden of cities, and turmoil of men,
Joys, griefs, unmeaning—she forgets them then.
Her breasts are bare; to Grief she brings surcease
She gives her restless sons the Milk of Peace ;
Lulls them to sleep ; draws them from thoughts oi
pelf ;
Telling them sweet, old stories of herself.
Ah, me ! If I could but contrive, to write
These stories—half of them—in black and white,
The sons of men would throng from ev’ry land
Beneath the sun to kiss this simple hand ;
And they would bring me gifts a king might prize,
And fill my rooms with rarest merchandise.
The starkest Philistine, uncouthest Goth,
Would clothe my limbs in costly suits of cloth ;
And Latakia I should smoke, indeed,
Instead of this weird, black, Australian weed ;
And ev’ry soul of them would clamor, “ Mine
The glory, first, to fill his cup with Wine ! ”
All secrets deep, all that I hear and see
Of hidden things, the Night reveals to me.
If I could only tell the things I know,
And feel, and hear ! Pate will not have it so.
Yet will I try to lightly indicate
Their nature —with apologies to Fate !
I know what ev’ry flow’r with drowsy head
Down-drooping drfeams of—and the seeming-dead,
I know how they, escaped from care and strife,
Ironically moralise on Life ;
And know what—when the moon walks on the
waves —
They whisper to each other in their graves.
I know that white clouds, drifting from stark
coasts
Across the sky at midnight, are the ghosts
Of sailors drowned at sea, who yearn to win
A quiet grave beside their kith and kin,
In still green churchyards, where these lie at ease,
Far from the sound of surge, and roar of seas.
I know the message of the mournful rain
That beats upon the widow’s window-pane ;
It says “ God’s mercy with God’s sorrow goes,”
And deeper things—but these God only knows.
I know the meaning of the roar of seas ;
I know the glad spring sap-song of the trees,
And that great chant to which, in tuneful grooves,
The green round Earth upon its axis moves,
And that still greater chant the Bright Sun sing* —
Fire-crowned Apollo—the great chant that bring*
All things to life, and draws through spaces dim,
And star-sown realms, his planets after him.
I know the tune that led, since Life began,
The upward, downward, onward March of Man.
I hear the whispers that the Arngels twain,
Of Death and Life, exchange in meeting. Fain
Are they to pause ; their errands will not stay—
“ Never ! ” “ For ever ! ” This is all they say.
I hear the twitterings, inarticulate,
Of souls unborn that press around the gate
Of Birth, each striving which shall first escape
From formless vapor into human shape ;
And see how mostly, in that struggle blind,
The meanest souls the fairest bodies find.
I know the tale the bird of passionate heart,
The Nightingale, tries ever to impart
To men, though vainly—for I well believe
That in her brown breast beats the heart of Eve,
Who, with her sweet, sad, wistful music, tries
To tell her sons of their lost Paradise,
And solemn secrets man had grace to know,
When God walked in the garden, long ago.
Yea, I have seen, with trembling and with awe
The vision terrible Lucretius saw :
The great white Universe—suns, stars, grief, bliss—
Plunging for ever down a black abyss.
But give me Taylor—Bishop Jeremy—
Who likens all the star-worlds that we see
(Which seem to run an everlasting race)
Unto a snowstorm sweeping on through space . . .
Suns, planets, stars : in glorious array
They march upon their unknown, wondrous way.
Thought, seraph-wing’d, and swifter than the light,
Unto the dim verge of the Infinite
Pursues them, through that strange ethereal flood
In which they swim—(mayhap it is the blood
G-f Universal God, wherein they are
But corpuscles ; sun, asteroid, and star ;
And this great starry stream we see, a dim
Small pulse in'the remotest vein of Him) —
Pursues in vain, and from lone, awful glooms
Turns back to earth again with weary plumes.
Well! let them go! They know their own affairs—
Ours, after all, may be as great as theirs.
Great, small, swift, slow are terms. Full oft a vain
Young thought grows grey in passing through the
brain.
Yet that which is lives while it lives : so I.
Give me the earth ; the saints may have the sky.
Through glacial gulfs of space the soul must roam
To know the comfort of this earthly home.
Ah, Mother dear ! Broad-bosomed Mother Earth !
Mother of all our Joy, Grief, Madness, Mirth !
Mother of Flow’r and Fruit, of Stream and Sea
We are thy children and we cling to thee.
I lay my head upon thy breast, and hear,
Small, small and faint, yet strangely sweet and
clear,
The hum and clash of little worlds below,
Each on its own path moving, swift or slow j
And list’ning, ever, with intenter ear,
Through din of wars invisible, I hear
A Homer—genius is not gauged by mass
Singing his Iliad on a blade of grass.
And nations hearken ; his great song resounds
Unto the tussock’s very utmost bounds.
States rise and fall, each blade of grass upon,
But still his song, from blade to blade, rolls on
Through all the tussock-world ; and Helen still
Is fairest fair, and Ajax, wild of will —
An Ajax whose huge length when measured o er
Is full ten-thousandth of an inch, or more —
Still hurls defiance at his gods, whose home
Is in the distant, awful, dew-drop dome
That trembling hangs, suspended from a spray,
An inch above him—worlds of space away.
Old prophecies foretell, but Time proves all,
The day will come when it, like Troy, shall fall. . .
Lo ! Through this small, great wondrous song
there runs
The marching-melody of stars and suns !
At times I hear, in God’s great Loom of Life,
The shuttles sing of Joy, Woe, Peace and Strife,
And (dreamwise) see Him bright with dark threads
twist—
The grand, old, archetypal Humorist.
I know these things, yet cannot others tell
Their meanings. Over all is cast a spell.
Secrets they are, sealed with a seven-fold seal,
My soul knows what my tongue may not reveal.
I love the Night! De Musset wrote at night
His Orient-perfumed poems exquisite,
His Nights of Cleopatra, and could make
Wax-dips the place of bright Canopus take.
Balzac, by lamplight, with black-magic art,
Exposed the mysteries of woman’s heart.
Woman ! The lines I’ve written I have scanned—
They hardly mention you. I kiss your hand !
I kiss your hand collective ! Ah, could I
An Ugly Woman see before I die—
One, only, Ugly Woman ! I would frame
A song of her would set men’s hearts aflame.
But she is dead, and useless are complaints—
Sweet Ugly Woman buried with the saints !
I love the Night! Bright Day the soul shuts in ;
Night sends it soaring to its starry kin.
If I must leave at last my place of birth,
This homely, gracious, green, familiar Earth,
With all it holds of sorrow and delight,
I pray my parting-hour may be at Night,
And that her curtain dark may softly fall
On scenes I love, ere I depart from all.
Then shall I, haply, journeying through the Vast
Mysterious Silences, take one, long, last,
Fond look at Earth, and watch, from depths afar,
I he dear old planet dwindling to a star,
And sigh, “Farewell!” unto the friends of yore,
Whose kindly faces I shall see no more.
VICTOR J. DALEY.
Westralians would like to be assured of
the value of the harbour improvement scheme at
Fremantle, on which a lot of money has been sunk.
The work comprises the prolongation of the Swan
River mouth by two miles, the removal of a rocky
bar, deepening of the channel to 30ft., and some
reclamation and many incidentals. This will
make a very small harbour, and the Swan River
anyway has only a 13ft. channel to Perth. Admiral
Bridge, when visiting Fremantle, refused to ex-
press any opinion of the value of the work, which
is considered ominous. It is not yet demonstrated
that the province will get value for the £BOO,OOO
which the job will cost, and the sum anyway is a
lot of money for West Australia to spend on
doubtful improvements to the harbour.

shows a vast improvement over last year’s similar
show. The past 12 months have evidently been
devoted by Australian amateurs to the study
of pictorial effect as well as to the development of
technical skill, and as a result they have scored
heavily. The landscapes, both in choice of sub-
ject, printing and tone, are in nearly every case
exquisite examples of photographic art, and com-
pare favorably with any productions of the old
world. In architecture the same high standard is
maintained, the majority following the effective
Yankee method of showing a building- in the
bright, midday sun with the lights and shadow*
in strong contrast, instead of the English fashion
of exhibiting a dull drab surface with a clouded
sky. One picture in particular, that of Melb.
Town Hall portico, is worthy to rank with the
best reproductions of Habper’s or the Century.
Another branch entered on for the first time is
that out of which Downey, of London, makes a
huge income—the representation of handsome
female figures in the centre of some striking land-
scape, after the style of Marcus Stone’s pictures.
These are all in the first class, but where the nude
has been attempted the one miserable failure of
the whole exhibition is manifest. None of the
photographs have been happy in ch ice of models,
all those exhibited being distinctly . ihandsome in
feature and very faulty in bodily .- nmetry; yet
it is not impossible to obtain good .unale models
as proved by last year’s exhibition, where a Venus-
like girl’s form was utterly wasted by bad posing.
The poses this year are also very weak—academic
and artificial, and with no freedom or action about
them ; and none of the artists appear to recognise
JP® difference between nudity and nakedness.
Nothing is more chaste than the nude,’’says Taffy,
m ‘ ‘ Trilby ; ” but these women are not nude, but
naked, and, as such, are offensive to all but the
prurient eye. To accentuate the idea of undress
most of them have some drapery or other clumsily
introduced as a sop to Respectability, which
defeats its own end. Ambitious photographers of
the nude would do well to purchase “LeNudu
oa-lon, and study the effects of posing, or if
unable to assimilate any of its spirit, to copy the
poses outright. The one exception to the undressed
horror is that of a nude child climbing a cliff. It

Tb« NEW “LIP-FLAN6E” FRUE VANNER BELT.
“ Will Outlast Two of tbc Ordsoary.”
Genuine “ Frue ” Belts (obtainable only from
the patentees or their authorised agents) have, owing
to the great care and attention paid to their manu-
facture, invariably given good satisfaction, but, after
being in use a long time, the old flange had a ten-
dency to become weak and lose its vertical position.
This prevented the machine carrying the proper depth
of load, and allowed the sand to slop over and get
into the bearings. The new “ Lip-Flange,” which
SECTIONAL VIEW OF FLANGE
has just been patented throughout the colonies, does
away with this difficulty almost entirely. It is
made of a very superior and elastic rubber prepared
in a special manner, and its peculiar shape prevents
it cracking in going over the rollers, or losing its
vertical position. All “ Prue Yanners ” sold in the
future will be fitted with this new “ Lip-Flange ”
Belt without additional charge, and the belts them-
selves may be procured from the patentees at a very
slight advance on the old price.
