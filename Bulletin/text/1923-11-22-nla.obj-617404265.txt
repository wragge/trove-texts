The leaves fall;
I watch them as they fall.
A little sound upon the ear
Only a friend could hear.
The leaves fall;
I watch them as they fall.
For time or long or brief
I knew each single leaf;
And each one gave to me
Some page in memory.
The leaves fall ;
I watch them as they fall,
Marking, from year to year,
How few have reached the sere.
Some fell in early prime,
Finding too sharp the clime;
Finding too soon the Spring
Had taken wing.
The leaves fall;
I watch them as they fall.
Some time I, too, shall go,
And, maybe, none will know
How much I loved all these,
My foresting of trees.
The leaves fall;
I watch them as they fall.

Musical Ignorance
If the writer of “In Defence of Musical
Ignorance” (R.P. l/11/’23) liad expressed
himself modestly, as befitting the title of his
essay, there would be no call for a reply.
Criticism is disarmed when ignorance is
pleaded, but as Mr. Lester Way, despite 'iis
admission of musical color-blindness, tak
upon himself to discuss musical sesthet: cs
and the future of music, he should be show
the error of his ways. A corrective writt
by a non-professional musician may, ther
fore, be acceptable.
Briefly put, Mr. Lester Way’s thesis i
(1) That only the naked and unadornec
tune or “theme” is real music; all else mea
ingless musical verbiage (or “trimmings
for short). (2) That what is known
“classical” music is merely a tune or them
so disguised by trimmings as to become u
recognisable, except to the “smug midd e-
class music-lover.”
If No. 1 were true, the tune of, say, “Po
Goes the Weasel,” played on a penny whistl
would be superior to, say, a choral fugue
Bach. This is so absurd that it needs
serious consideration. There is no account-
ing for tastes: one likes Shakspeare, anothe
likes Marie Corelli. But in music, as i n
literature, it is not the theme itself, bu
the way it is expressed, that constitutes th
art. Shakspeare’s themes are borrowed, bu;
they are transfigured by his genius. Sim -
larly, the musical genius extracts the essenc
from a given theme and brings it to its ful
est expansion. The truth is that the “trim
mnigs,” far from disguising and spoiling th
theme, are the very things that give it sig
nificance. The musician’s trimmings ar
akin to the poet’s use of the manifold form
of rhythm; and the theme often may requir
a foil to contrast with it and yet help th
exposition. Thus all great musical work
have not only their themes, but their counter
themes for the better expression of the com
poser’s ideas. It is false to say that grea
composers merely fog the themes; on th
contrary, they present them with the utmos
clearness, and, like the poet, from every
angle and in every light, with all the re
sources of their art.
. As for No. 2, Mr. Way’s idea of a “classic’
is quaint and novel, but palpably erroneou
to the last degree. What is a classic? To
the man in the street the word has assumec
a purely conventional meaning, as denoting
something difficult—above the ordinary. Bu :
a classic is really nothing more than a work
that successive generations have found good
As to any hard and fast division into gooc
or bad, popular opinion during a sufficient
period of time seems to determine it un
erringly. The value of a work may be doubt
ful for a time, but ultimately it finds its
level. The fittest music—the one that gives
the most pleasure—alone survives. The sur
vivors are. in fact, the classics. The classics
of yesterday were the modern works of the
time, and those of our moderns who can
stand the test of popular opinion may be-
come the classicists of to-morrow. The musi-
cal public is universal, and knows what it
wants. It embraces the ignorant and the
cultured. Because music affects man’s emo-
tions and primitive passions, he cannot be
fooled. To one person the faculty of re-
membering a tune may be ample qualification
tor enjoyment, while another requires to
delve down to the very roots of the art to
obtain full satisfaction. But the end in
view is the same always—enjoyment. Let
the great mass of the people prefer senti-
mental ballads to more serious music—why
shouldn t they? The popularity of the folk-
>B full justification for its existence,
uut that is no reason why higher music
should be sneered at and its devotees re-
viled. When Mr. Way says that classicism
is nothing but obscure technicalities, gym-
nastics, meaningless runs and trills,” he is
simply making himself ridiculous. Far from
being obscure, clearness is the distinguishing
hallmark of every classic, as everyone knows
who is familiar with the scores of the Great
Masters.
The early forms of music were the un-
accompanied, unharmonised tunes, but de-
velopment progressed on polyphonic lines out
ot part-singing, when every chorister sang
his independent theme. To those who cannot
appreciate this form of the art, all poly-
phonic forms, such as the canon, the fugue
the symphony—in all of which the instru-
ments take the part of the human voice
must remain a sealed book. Many persons
are only able to grasp one theme at a time
and when several motives, together with their
counter-themes, are combined in a musical
composition, a certain amount of education
is required to follow the exposition, working
out and summary, or the “plot” of the piece
£ °r music speaks a language of its own that
has to be learnt by those who would derive
the completest enjoyment from it. Good
music requires to be heard frequently before
it can be fully appreciated, just as the great
works of literature open up fresh vistas and
thoughts every time one re-reads them with
advancing years and experience.
Let us cultivate the taste of good music;
it will grow with every performance. Only
a highly-trained musician could possibly fol-
low a complicated score at first hearing, but
that should not prevent us from doing our
little bit towards self-improvement.
ERNEST WUNDERLICH.
Arthur Adams
Thirteen years ago a bookseller in Leices-
ter-square in London recommended me a
book "by anew man, an Australian. It’s
been very well reviewed. ‘Galahad Jones’ —
very pretty little story, I believe, sir.”
. 1 retty little story” was rather dishearten-
ing, but the man’s advice was not bad, as a
rule, and I bought the book. London is a
dull place, gloomy and hard, hide-bound in
narrow pockets of alleged distinctions, even
in thought and imagination. A mannered
place, its very revolts run hopelessly soon
to the barriers of what a man may do and
what he mayn’t. And in its books 13 years
ago the manners stuck out well in the fore-
ground of the thought. The suburbs were
pitiful; Kensington was the limit, and most
of it was debatable. Beyond that barrier
the farce-types lived: that was static. Some-
times some shocking rebel wrote a serious
book or play _ about Ealing or Putney; but
the whole British nation rose up as one in-
dignant man to see to it that the author
lived and died in those comic places for his
pains.
Well, I sat in my suburb for two delect-
able evenings with Galahad Jones for my
mate. I knew him. I had travelled on the
underground railway and in penny ’buses
with him for years. And then Adams made
ic clear to me that Galahad’s drift of boronia
perfume (I didn’t know what boronia was
then, but that didn’t matter), and his chord
of hidden, half-remembered music were tin-
common heritage of the farce-types who tra-
velled and worked, pared cheese and lived
out their absurd, heroic lives beside me. That
Galahad was. an Australian was nothing; lie
was international to me. The sweetness of
the book stayed in my mind for months —for
lo years, since the writing of this paper re-
calls it to life. I can feel now the effect
or strong sunshine, of a happy sincerity, of
an unmannered grace of simplicity. To-day
I might quarrel with the sob-stuff of the
last scene, with omnes _so fortuitously on
the stage; I might smile in a superior manner
at the little gesture typified in the last sen-
tence— Masters, the play is over!”—which
is violently out of the picture. But then I
quarrelled with nothing, was superior about
nothing. I loved the book.
Adams’s style in “Galahad Jones” quite
conquers the years and the fashions between
its publication and to-day. It is a good
style, tender, keen and curiously, warmlv
sensitive. The opening:—
Galahad Jones paused with a graceless irresolu-
tion upon the steps of the post-office colonnade. In
the keen sunlight of that Australian Spring day, he
in his dark, mdete: minate suit and his round, hard
black hat, was aesthetically an offence. Had his
pudgy figure been more impressive he would have
been a crime. But, short-legged, plump, his undis-
tinguished face menaced with the double chin of
middle-age and adorned with a pudgy moustache he
was, against the sharp wash of sunlight upon the
big columns, merely a careless blot.
I submit that that, attained by an apparently
careless . simplicity, is an excellent picture.
Upon his hard, positive background, on the
sharp definition of sunlight and shadow, the
author places tenderly the negative figure
ot his hero, touches him twice (with “grace-
less irresolution” and “careless blot”), re-
peats the word, “pudgy,” and there is Gala-
had Jones. It is a good sample of the book’s
hrm and dainty prose, pliant and skilful
under its simplicity, warm and sympathetic
under its half-mockery. Throughout the-
story this technical excellence carries Gala-
had to the borderland of fancy in Sibyl’s
garden and hails him firmly back to the fact
of Em and the little Mosman house. With
great skill Adams gets every ounce out of
his charming situation while he builds up
his unique character of the suburban mat-
erialist hearing the lost music, following the
far, lost perfume. Finally, the perfume and
the music of fancy are unified with Em and
the workaday duty of fact; and the thing is
done. A first-rate piece of work.
good place we come down a
littie. It is cheap and easy to say that
Adams is a one-book man ; but it isn’t true.
Adams has plenty more good books to write •
the mme of his gentle impact and merging
of the dream and the reality is not nearly

popularity of the thought a trifle quickly
perhaps, m the case of “Grocer Great heart,”
winch seems, m consequence, to be the tail
or Galahad s comet. But that, I think, was
because he didn’t take the time to shift to
another seam of his mine, a mistake that
any man in a hurry might make. In “Grocer
Greatheart there is an equally fluent capa-
bility of style—marred certainly by an occa-
sional descent to catchiness, the catchiness
exemplified in the title—but informed mostly

HILARY LOFTING.
The Later Masefield
Though the needle of his literary compass
has since swung through a wide arc, John
Masefield began as a writer of sea stories.
In “A Mainsail Haul” and “A Tarpaulin
Muster” he collected fugitive essays, stories
and sketches of famous or infamous pirates,
all of which revealed him as a writer of pure
prose, with striking command over words
and a habit of arresting adjectival effects.
These books followed immediately on “Salt-
water Ballads” (1902), that striking semi-
savage group now so sought by the col-
lector, and on “Poems and Ballads” (1903).
Here he has summed up his wanderings on
the high seas in verse which furnishes a
parallel to the soldier-songs of Kipling. No-
thing of the patriotic polyphony of Newbolt
is in these verses ; Masefield knows too much
of the waters to regard them as Britain’s
private duekpond, and we have the hardship
and brutality and wild splendor of the sea in
poems full of ringing lines and novel images.
Buccaneer or tramp’s bo’s’n, it is all one
to Masefield, for whom romance and beauty
are always abroad. But it was not until he
had been publishing poetry for 10 years that
the reading public began to take him very
seriously or to search for stones to throw
at this madman who was outraging their
sense of fitness by the turbulent poems,
strange mixture of an unpoetie Words-
worth and a poetic Conrad, which he was
managing to publish in the English Re-
view. “The Everlasting Mercy” (1911),
“The Widow in the Bye Street” (1912),
“Dauber” (1912) and “The Daffodil Fields”
(1913) were hard on one another’s heels,
and with them it wars recognised that, for
good or ill, Masefield had come to stay. He
had been working at various prose books,
mostly boys’ stories, in the meantime, but
he now had accepted poetry as his chief
work, and settled down to it.
Then came the war, and in common with
all our British poets, save poor, overwrought
Flecker, dying in Switzerland, Masefield
failed to rise to the occasion. The products
of the five years—“ Philip the King,” “Good
Friday,” “Sonnets and Poems” and “Lolling-
don Downs” —did nothing to increase his
reputation. It seemed that in his books the
seaman had been submerged in the reformer,
for the poet of 10 years since had sadly de-
cayed. But with the issue of “A Poem and
Two Plays” we could see that the well had
not run dry. The book was not over-bur-
dened with merit; but at least no other man
could have written it. And in 1919 “Rey-
nard the Fox” gave a tradition to the litera-
ture of the hunt, and showed us that Mase-
field could feel and render the poetry of the
chase. He has a seaman’s love of horses,
and in this poem he holds us enthralled. I
know that once the hunt was in full cry I
was unable to put the book down. The real
hero of the poem is Reynard himself, and,
the Homeric catalogue of the hunt over, I
turned page after page with a womanish de-
sire to know the ending. But when he tried
the same thing again with “Right Royal”
I was not thrilled. He showed signs of de-
veloping again into his old, slangy self, a
writer marred by moralising and by a too
prominent place given to religion in mun-
dane matters. His writing became again
crude, violent and noisy ; and, though he had
dropped the stanza form, before whose im-
placable finger-post he had been reduced to
writing fill-up lines by the score, he showed
the same slap-dash style of composition
which before had driven the finicky ones to
fury, and his percentage of double and false
rhymes grew as his poetry went down. It
is a peculiar trait in a man w'ho can make
such music as Masefield that he continually
torments your ear with rhymes which are
for the eye only.
The “Enslaved” volume did mighty little
for him also. The name-poem in the book
possesses all Masefield’s old faults; this time
he chose a “romantic” subject, and the. re-
sult is something which immensely reminds
me of Byron’s dark Giaour and the Cor-
sair. He uses the word “beauty” (already
overworked) and other favorite words until
you wish he would give them a lifelong rest.
And the other poems—though “Cap on
Head,” which came, I think, from some-
where in Scott, is quite passable—do not
add to his poetical glory. Masefield has
always been best when he forgot the human
element and wrote of nature in calm or
storm. Turning to Swinburne’s sea poems
after Masefield is turning to a man whose
admiration always came when he was safely
on shore. With all his attempts at realism
his low life is not convincing; his attempts
at the dramatic are usually weak; nor is he
as true to humanity as “the Shropshire
Lad.” At his best he is the poet of the
vigorous; at his worst, something akin to
Wordsworth in his ethical maunderings.
QUENTIN POPE.
“Thence It Spread”
Year by year scores of works bearing emi-
nent names pour from the press dealing with
ancient civilisation and the early progress of
man. The keynote of nearly all this mass of
erudite guessing is found in the phrase,
“thence it spread.” There is a strong ten-
dency to trace every human idea to a foreign
source, to suggest that no element of cul-
ture that is in any way worth while could
possibly have had its origin on the soil where
it afterwards flourished. In the last century
there has been a very rapid spread of ideas,
and the investigator pushes his guess across
seas and continents 30 or 40 centuries or so
ago with as cheerful a disregard of proba-
bilities as that of the 12th-century monk
who believed the Britons were descended
from Brutus because both names began with
Br.
About the only things of absolutely uni-
versal spread to-day are the love of strong
liquors and the use of cheap cotton clothing;
yet writers on ancient culture would have
us believe that a subtle religious idea, a
method of building or even a system of writ-
ing, could leap from country to country in
a few generations and remain for many cen-
turies after the impulse that originally
brought it was gone—and this not among
relatively civilised peoples, but among primi-
tive savages for the first time. brought into
contact with a wandering uplift from far
countries. Let us admit that any idea might
spread anywhere on earth, but let us at
least consider the time it would probably take
to do so. The idea that Egyptian civilisation
might have reached America about the time
of the Christian era, and that all connections
between the two sides of the Pacific faded
out again a century or two later, is strangely
hard to believe. The proof of a connection
between China and Egypt is not in any way
established ; there is not even a shred of evi-
dence to show that the Nile was chronolo-
gically earlier to develop than the Yellow
River. That China was in touch—long-dis-
tance touch—with the earliest civilisations of
the Euphrates valley seems probable; but
then it may have been not the Euphrates
valley, but some other valley that in the faint
traditional record looks a little like it. Cer-
tainly Greek designs did get overland to
China from Samarkand, but how much part
did those Greek designs play in the national
art of China? About as much as the gar-
nered knowledge of the Polar regions played
in our own development of the frozen-meat
trade! True, Japan seems to have derived
its culture from China ; but it. took a great
many centuries fo get the elements of that
culture over a very narrow sea, even if in
doing so it did not displace another and a
simpler culture. 'XY
The theory that a wandering..civilisation
left Egypt at some remote period’ and went
zig-zagging about the Malay islands and the
Pacific, carefully missing all the other big
civilisations on the road, until it finally
arrived in America with little resemblance to
anything Egyptian, is a little too hard to
accept. If the Asiatic civilisations had their
origin by the Nile, then nothing is more cer-
tain than that Egyptian civilisation would
have reached America in an Asiatic form.
The very phrase, “thence it spread,” implies
resting-places by the way; and in such rest-
ing-places new ideas would have been gath-
ered. Certainly there might have been such
resting-places. A chain of little civilisations
might have run all the way, dodging both
Asia and Australia, and ail of them might
have disappeared in one great earthquake
which carefully selected the cultured spots
and left the others alone; but that does
not exactly shout its probability.
The theory that everything worth while
began in the Nile valley rests on very shaky
foundations. Very little that directly bears
the stamp of Egypt is found even in the
nearer countries ; and certainly the European
race, as it appears at the dawn of history,
owes very little indeed to Egyptian influence.
The earliest thing India remembers about
her civilisation —the memory is preserved in
caste, language and tradition —is that a
European race once ruled there and sow r ed
all the seeds of higher culture. The Euro-
pean race, under Cyrus, entered Babylon
with a better military knowledge than others
possessed, a reasonable amount of culture
and a kindlier feeling than world-conquer-
ing peoples had yet shown. (Did Cyrus not
even restore the Jews to Zion as the British
are doing to-day?) The Europeans of the
West made the first deep-sea voyages; then-
art objects in bronze and gold are finer in
design and workmanship than those of Egypt,
and hint at no relationship with anything
either African or Asiatic. We know that
Egypt borrowed the chariot from Europe;
we do not find the Europeans borrow-
ing anything of consequence directly from
the Egyptians. Woven garments—the test
of a considerable human advance —are as
old as the root language of all the European
tongues; and, considering the climatic needs,
the first loom is more likely to have been set
up in the cold North than in a land where
even in its most advanced days 90 per cent,
of the people w r ore about as much clothing
as would make a small modern towel. Why
must we forever cry “stinking fish” about our
own beginnings? The European child seems
to furnish irrefutable evidence that the white
race possesses the oldest culture, the Chin-
ese alone rivalling us in antiquity.
Somewhere in the North, between tin
Urals and the Western Ocean, a hundred
thousand years went to the makings of a race
of men differing from all others. A culture
grew up in that unknown region, and “thence
it spread” with infinite slow-ness of move-
ment to east and west. At last it pervaded
a great tract of Europe. Eastward it pene-
trated India; and thousands of years later
a little section of it took form in whatever
was vital of the Medo-Persian Empire. When
the breath of Europe was gone from that
race-movement, Persia fell before another
European fragment and became the vassal of
the Macedonian Empire. But these were only
late impulses; and the heart of Europe was
still somewhere in the North. Of such facts
there should be no reasonable doubt. While
Egypt was building up ridiculous pyramids,
Europe was taming horses and driving
chariots; while Egypt was pondering
the book of the dead, Europe was
experimenting with the rudiments of
free government; while Egypt was accumu-
lating slaves, Europe was shaping the
heroic tale into poetry. The very earliest
touch of recorded history with the so-called
European barbarians —those who were as
yet uneontaminated by Asiatic or African
influences —shows woman exalted to perfect
equality with man. It is a very decent
Europe that we discover when we lift even
the fringe of the curtain of forgetfulness that
had fallen on the unrecorded past. In it
were the seeds of all we value to-day; and
those seeds began to flourish into new growth
just when the influences of the ancient Nile
and Euphrates began to wither. In Europe
arose the hope of the world, and “thence it
spread” to the lands peopled from Europe—
and never much beyond them.
DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
William Morris
William Morris has faded into unmerited
obscurity; and I think it is mainly because
he wasted far too much of his precious time
upon an ideal socialism. All socialism is
impossible, but Morris’s socialism was more
impossible than that. He strove to create
an Earthly Paradise of knights and romance.
This phase of his life is hardly worth even
mentioning.
The childhood of a poet or an artist is the
most important period of his life. It is as
the child that he gathers the material which
in time will be painted in pictures or sung
in poems. The later period may give
the outward form, but the inward emotion is
usually generated in childhood. All the beau-
tiful things that a child sees but barely
notices; every scent that seems to fade en-
tirely from his nostrils; every sensation of
touch —all are registered in the sub-conscious,
and wait to blossom forth in later years. Thus
it was with Morris. When he was very
young his parents moved from Wales to
Woodford House, near Epping Forest, and
there he roamed amongst the trees, a young
knight, a new Galahad, dressed in a glitter-
ing coat of mail, a small sword dangling at
his side, with a young pony for horse. It
is hardly an exaggeration to say that here
we see the whole of Morris’s life.
His first book was published before he
was 30. It was strikingly original, and was
barely noticed, excepting by his own imme-
diate circle. But Swinburne instantly real-
ised its true worth, and wrote in noble praise
of it, pointing to the intensity of its passion
and the color it exuded. Morris revolted
from the atmosphere of Tennyson’s “Idylls
of the King,” and especially from his con-
ception of Galahad, whose “strength was as
the strength of 10, because his heart was
pure.” When Morris wrote his version of
Galahad, lie made the knight yearn in his
loneliness for someone to comfort him, some-
one of whom he might think all day long:—
Night after night your horse treads down alone
The sere damp fern ; night after night you sit
Holding the bridle like a man of stone
Dismal, unfriended: w-hat thing comes of it 1
There is the true Galahad: in Tennyson he
is a ghost, in Morris he is a man. All the
writer’s great qualities find a vent in his
incomparable “Defence of Guenevere”: his
love of the definite image; the physical rap-
ture in the soft touch of tender hands, the
crisp softness of golden hair, the cool kiss
of full lips; his magnificent color and the
emotion that underlies all his work. In this
poem of the Queen’s defence before the
Knights charging her with adultery, the dis-
traught speech of the agonised Guenevere
could not have been rendered better.
Morris’s chief work lies in a gigantic col-
lection of verse-tales, linked together, and
with a prologue. This is called, and by no
mere chance, “The Earthly Paradise,” the
phrase that is the keynote of all Morris’s
effort. With matchless skill tale succeeds
tale, and ever their burden is the same: the
visible glory of the world that crumbles
away before the approach of death; of lovers
w’lio can kiss for a day but on the morrow
are sundered. “Passing Aw r ay” is the under-
song of it all. But the picture he draw’s is
not the moral one that “all is vanity,” for
he is only conscious of the mutability of it
all because he is so vitally conscious of its
beauty, and he clings all the closer to earth
and to man because he know’s they are but
mortal. Half the world’s beauty lies in its
transience, as we continually adore the
beauty of her whom we love because she is
never the same, because the light on hair
and eyes is always” changing, each poise of
limb a grace unknown before. So it was
with Morris and the world. Each fleeting
and elusive loveliness is made _ more poig-
nant with the knowledge that it has been
and never will bo again. Yet though “beauty
vanishes, beauty passes, though each kiss
lasts but the kissing and grief goes over,
here in his Earthly Paradise lie has cheated
the tyrant Death, who, while he takes all
other lovely things, may not touch that which
art has consecrated.
Though he names himself “the idle singer
of an empty day,” in reality nobody could
have been more energetic. Besides his
“Earthly Paradise” and shorter poems there
is the gigantic “Life and Death of Jason,”
a masterpiece. He preached his socialism,
wrote magic tales of knights and Norsemen,
translated Homer and Virgil, designed and
weaved tapestries, executed stained-glass win-
dows and gave a new direction to the decora-
tor's thoughts. Surely lie was one of the
giants in the Victorian era.

A Satchel of Books
The Confessions of a Tenderfoot, by Ralph Stock
(Heinemami). Sketches of experiences in Western
Canada, in the South Seas, in Sydney (chiefly the
Domain), and in Queensland, where the writer grew
strawberries and pineapples for a few months. Here
and there, as in the story of the crossing in an
Atlantic cattle-boat, the old Ralph Stock grips you ;
but it is poor stuff, for the most part, written with
a clumsy, careless pen.
A Land of Opportunities, by E. J. Stuart, .I.l*.
(John Lane). The record of a voyage-in a small
schooner from Broome to Wyndham to spy out the
mineral and other resources of the great nor’-west
corner of the continent. The book, which is really
a compilation from the diary of Stuart—J.R. —who
headed the expedition, makes an interesting enough
story of an unusual trip, but the matter of the
resources can hardly be said to have been handled
convincingly. An excellent collection of photographs
—upwards'of 70 of them—help the letterpress.
•
“Macknade”: “C. McL.” (R.P. 13/9/’23) is cer-
tainly, as he admits, not a “skilled Egyptologist.’’
Amenhotep IV., alias Akhnaton, was born 1375 b.c.,
became Pharaoh of Egypt in 1364, and ruled 17
years, so that at his death he was only 28 years
of age. According to “C.McL.,” Akhnaton worshipping
the disk (of the sun) is “indeed a quaint figure of
ugliness.” Akhnaton did not worship the disk, and
we know by his bones (discovered by Theodore Davis
in 1907) that he was, apart from his misshapen
skull, a well-made man. His depicted ugliness in
the so-called “new art” is easily explained. In
many representations of Egyptians of early dynasties
one sees the great stomach, large thighs and pon-
derous hips so prominent in the drawings of
Akhnaton. Thus the “new ait” may be said to be
a renaissance —a return to the classical period of
archaic days. As to his disease, the skull when
examined by Dr. Elliot Smith was pronounced to
be that of a man who suffered from epileptic fits
and who was probably subject to hallucinations
Curiously enough, the idiosyncrasies of this mis-
shapen sconce are precisely those which Lombroso
has stated to be so usual in a religious reformer.
For this great king’s chief claim to remembrance
rests on the fact that he was the first monotheist
in history. For the first time in the history of man
the real meaning of God, as we now understand it,
had been comprehended ; the idea of a beneficent
Creator who, though remote and impersonal, could
love each of his creatures, great or small, had been
grasped by this young- Pharaoh. The sun’s disK
was not worshipped; it was merely the symbol
of the new religion—just as the cross is the symbol
of our creed.


on Were another 6i
ONE searching scrutiny in your mirror—face to face, as if you were
another girl—such clear-sighted honesty is of inestimable value. Meet
yourself face to face in your mirror and pass judgment upon what
you see as critically as if you were some other girl. Don’t condone complexion
defeds. Don’t console yourself by hoping they won’t be noticed. Don’t
excuse sallowness and blemishes by blaming the light. Instead, take note of
every fault and learn the remedy.
Whether your problem is to improve a poor complexion or to keep a good
one, the first step is the same. The network of tiny pores which compose
the surface of the skin must, every day, be cleansed from clogging accumu-
lations. The natural oil of the skin, which nature has provided as a
beautifier, is often secreted in excess. In combination with dust and powder
it quickly fills up these minute pores unless carefully washed away.
Soap and water is the only effedive means of cleansing yet discovered. Cold
cream alone only increases the clogging, while other remedies are often
unnecessarily harsh. The selection of the soap you use is the only problem
and this is easily solved. Facial soap must be pure, mild and soothing in
its adion. Thus you should select Palmolive.
Once a day, and the best time is bed-time, wash your face thoroughly with
the profuse, creamy Palmolive lather. Massage it thoroughly into the skin.
Then rinse carefully and dry with a fine, soft towel. A week of this simple
cleansing treatment with Palmolive will work wonders in the condition of your
skin. Buy a cake of Palmolive to-day. Begin this treatment to-night. Soon,
to look into your mirror will make you glad.

This is evidence of the great speed and
the great saving in time effected by the

If you are interested in saving money, it
will pay you to have a Burroughs Calcu-

Such demonstration will not obligate you
in any way, but it will show whether
there is a place in your business for this

Cello.
Across the dark the oboe cries its plaint;
Beneath a wave of silver-wafted sound
The flutes upon the summit fall and faint;
And, lo,! quick-striding, resonant and
round,
Above the clamorous wail of viojins,
The hungry ’cello, through the riven night,
Destroys the dreaming web that music spins,
And thunders to the farthest, blue-drowned
height.
What is the ’cello asking as it sings?
What hunger lies behind; what heaped-up
pain,
Surging from out, the long-struck, quivering
strings?
What mad desire mounting the world in
vain?
I cannot bear it—l who beat my wings—
I am the ’cello doomed with life! Oh,
hark!
I am the ’cello crying myriad things—
The wandering voice of pain that shreds
the dark!

Nona.
You call to me
Out of the murmur of the mighty sea;
I read your message in the singing stars.
A white hand drums
Under the window of my memory;
A thin wind comes
Spelling your name in swirling scrolls of
dust.
On some cool stair,
Gowned in the glory of your golden hair,
I know you wait
While the pale angels beckon you away—
Nona, my mate!
QUEENSLAND.
RUSTYFACE.
The Ride.
Somewhere between the dawn and dark,
When the last carol of the lark
Ilad died away, and in pale light
The black swans passed in mystery flight,
We rode towards the purpled hills,
Between the swamps and crystal rills,
Beside the river green with weeds,
And lined with russet water-reeds,
While the three horses found their way
Through whispering mazes cool and grey
(Erua, with the tawny mane,
Old Silvertips and Pope Urbane).
It was September. She it is
Who comes with starry clematis,
Who spills the gold upon the streams
Woven of warm delight and dreams;
And even though we could not see,
We felt her subtle witchery
In fragrance from the orchard spaces,
In petals blown on upturned faces,
In delicate and gentle airs.
And so we climbed the long, green stairs
That lead to Windy Ridge; and then
The night was round us in the glen—
A night so still and soft and black,
With not a shadow on the track,
And not a sound but the soft beat
On the damp turf of horses’ feet
(Erua. with the tawny mane,
Old Silvertips and Pope Urbane).
By rock and buttressed height we sped,
The dark trees lacing overhead.
Sudden, above a mossy wall,
W T e heard a mopoke’s plaintive call;
Sudden, where little by-paths lay,
A dim shape crashed across the way;
And where the great trees deeply bend
We found the forest’s ferny end,
And rode into the balmy night.
The wide, clear skies were pierced with light,
The worlds of all infinity
Were sailing on their star-buoyed sea;
And from the hills the moon, far-spent,
Rose in a rim of silver pent.
Across the uplands bare and stark
We rode lighthearted through the dark;
Below us flickered, far, far down.
The night-lamps of a sleeping town;
And little home-lights, faint and still,
Shone from lone vale and rugged hill.
Adown long slopes of scented gorse
Thudded each eager, cantering horse
(Erua, with the tawny mane,
Old Silvertips and Pope Urbane).
Until, where river mists hung damp,
We paused beside the dismal swamp,
And in a single, silent file
Walked by the track a winding mile
To where the long, grey hanks stretch wide
Left naked by the sluggish tide.
And there, in hushed expectancy.
We sought what we had come to see,
And shudderingly looked to find
The blue death-candles in the wind.
Will-o’-the-wisps ! Each wavering light
So strangely hued, so pale and bright,
Across the marshes danced and died
In a mad chase unsatisfied.
Like elfin tapers in the night,
Like lanterns for a tricksy sprite,
Like forlorn, seeking, aimless things
They flickered round in tiny rings ;
They leapt in wild capricious mood
Between the river and the wood,
And in the eerie silence ghosts
Were wheeling round in soundless hosts.
The wind blew chill, the moon of night
Kept vigil with her waning light,
As eagerly we turned away
And rode between the ridges grey,
Hasting as from an evil place
Across the hills, until all space
Was filled with clear and tender light
Each tree upon the mountain height,
Each little bush on field and lawn
Stood glistening in the rosy dawn.
And then, in glorious mniesty.
The sun flared from the turquoise sea
So. by long river road and plain
We came to our own land again.

THE LAW AND THE PRESS.
Both the Courts aud the Press are in their
own spheres the guardians of public liber-
ties. Both of them are human institutions,
and to neither of them, therefore, is com-
plete freedom given. There is an appeal from
court to court; moreover, there is the rule
of precedent, which, in effect, is another re-
cognition of individual frailty—an attempt
to combine the wisdom of all in the judg-
ments of one. What we call “the Press” is
equally or even more liable to err in its
individual judgments. It is appointed by
nobody; it is self-chosen. Almost anyone
can start a newspaper or magazine; almost
anyone may be the “we” of its editorial
thunders. The person in control may not
even be honest. He may have established
his paper to grind an axe of his own, even
to pay off some old scores. It is true that
such a paper rarely lasts long; the old-
established paper is prima facie not of that
character. But that is the truth about the
press; and, recognising it, the honest news-
paper knows that it musk be strictly con-
trolled. Hence it does not rebel against
a libel law; it even realises that proceedings
in respect of that misty thing known as con-
tempt of court have their proper uses. The
misfortune of the Press and the mis-
fortune of the public is that both these pro-
cesses of law are liable to misuse for the
same purpose—the suppression of comment for
the time being. And because there is no
statute law on the subject of “contempt”
the Press has always had a vague fear of
consequences. It has thus permitted itself
again and again to be bluffed into silence
when the public good has demanded that it
should speak out. For this it cannot be
sjyd that the Courts are to blame. On the
contrary, the Judges, both in England and in
Australia, have repeatedly laid down the law
in terms extending to the newspaper the most
liberal rights of comment. Indeed, some
of them have shown the greatest impatience
with proceedings for contempt—as, for in-
stance, Justice Piiillimore (ex parte the
standard) , who "‘was glad to have this
opportunity of saying what he had said be-
tore, and what he wished to say every time
~,7 na 1 mo]y -' the world had gone mad on
the doctrine of contempt of court.”
* » * »
In case, after case of late years this doc-
trine has been exploited by unscrupulous
persons, not, as they have disingenuously
claimed, to safeguard justice and maintain
the prestige of the Courts, but in order to
stine comment on their own malfeasances.
Such proceedings, of course, almost invariably
™! the misfortune is that a wrong is gener-
ally done to the public in permitting them to
be begun. Both the law and the sense of
the matter were set out in Malone’s case
as lately as three years ago, when, in re-
fusing a rule on a contempt application
against Lloyd George by the then M.P. for
Last Leyton, Justice McCardie said:—
It was vital to distinguish between contempt on
a l? e !l .'g matter in which comment was made before
adjudication on the matter by the appropiate and
competent tribunal, and comment which was made on
the adjudication by a competent tribunal. In the
latter case the Press and the public were entitled
to assume that the decision was right, to comment
m \ decision, and the facts which had been
established, in the opinion of the tribunal. Unless
that right existed, vast infringements would be made
on the right to make observations which belonged to
the Press and the public at the present time.'
And again by Justice Sargant in Dunn v
Bevan :
Proceedings are pending immediately the writ is
issued, and as long as any proceedings may be taken.
Rut when the cause is dead or ended, comments may
be made 5 and the fact that a new trial has been
moved for makes no difference.
If there be any who think that no harm
can be done by the granting of a rule nisi
The Bulletin puts it to them that these
results may, and in most cases will, cer-
tainly follow
(1) The newspaper to which the rale is directed
will be gagged over the very period during which
. the public mind. is most receptive to comment on a
matter as to which it may be urgently necessary for
the electors or taxpayers to be enlightened; and
other newspapers’ right of comment will be similarly
restricted. -
(2) At a time when the Courts may be con-
gested (as they usually are) three Judges will be
occupied hearing a suit which, on the face of it,
is no more bona fide than the “stop writ” with which
a certain class of political candidate shuts the mouths
of dangerous critics during elections.
(3) The Full Court being thus improperly used,
scores of litigants and witnesses who are properly
before other Courts have to cool their heels until
the learned members of the Full Court are at liberty
to attend to their matters.
Courts have laid down the law as clearly
as any newspaper could desire with regard
to contempt. What now only remains to
do is for individual Judges to be less com-
plaisant in the granting of rules nisi
® © 9 §
So far from suggesting that there should
oe no proceedings for contempt The
Bulletin believes that there should be
many more than there are. The
trouble is that in most cases in
which the course of justice is tampered
with, there is nobody of means sufficiently
interested to move in the matter. There
ought to be some such person; and he should
be a public officer. It is really no part of
an interested litigant’s duty to present him-
self as a St. George shielding the defence-
less maiden Justice against the Press or
other dragons. The Judges are quite cap-
able of maintaining their dignity and that of
the Courts, and in carrying out their duties
they can rely on having the whole power
of the State at their backs. It may, how-
ever, be granted that Judges cannot read all
the periodicals in which cases of alleged
contempt may be found, or inform themselves
of all those public meetings, etc., at which
the course of justice may be interfered with.
For analogous reasons the office of King’s
Proctor was created. Clearly, it would
be impossible for divorce Judges to person-
ally smell out cases of collusion, and so an
official exists who does it for them, and de-
cides when it is desirable for the Court to
act. The appointment of a proctor charged
with the business of discriminating between
cases of genuine contempt and matters in
which one of the parties to a suit is pal-
pably using the doctrine as a smoke-screen
would prevent expensive fiascos that waste the
Full Court’s valuable time. It would also
tend to increase the public respect for the
Courts which is shaken as often as the law
is misused; and justice would be better
served than at present, when those who have
no more than exercised their legal rights and
performed their public duty are liable to be
forced into litigation by any adventurer with
money to spend, and subjected to all the
worry, delay and vilification which are in-
separable from this type of action.
“FINANCIAL SPECTRES” AND
QUEENSLAND STATISTICS.
Randolph Bedfokd in defence of his leader’s
policy:—•
Talking of “Financial Spectres Ahead,” The Bul-
letin (8/11/’23) says of Queensland that “under
his [Theodore’s] rule the richest of the six States
secured the lowest place for railway earnings, the
lowest for area under cultivation in proportion to
population, the lowest for progress in manufactures
and the lowest for the size of workers’ share of
factory output. It came lowest save one for its
contribution per head to the common or Federal
fund, and lowest save two for savings-bank deposits
per head. But it secured top place for State taxa-
tion per head, top place for unemployed and top
place but one for debt.”
In the comparisons of State railways The Bulletin
is content with a very little of the truth. Compare
these figures:—
Miles op Railways per Head op Population.
Westralia .. 11.98
Queensland .. 7.48
S. Australia .. 6.85
Also —
Tasmania .. 2.97
Victoria .. 2.78
N.S.W. .. .. 2.40
Working Expenses per Mile Run (in pence).
Victoria .. 118.21
N.S.W 116.17
Queensland .. 112.86
S.A 111.56
W.A. .. .. 111.19
Tasmania .. 82.37
Lass after payment of working expenses, interest
and other charges: N.S.W., £577,032 ; Victoria,
£44,125 ; Queensland, £1,581,060 ; S.A., £561,304 ;
YV.A., £418,370 ; Tas„ £81,907. With double the
area and more than double the mileage of South
Aus., Queensland loses nearly three times as much
as South Australia, and compares favorably with
other States considering fts smaller population.
(Victoria’s population is three times as dense, and
over 50 per cent, of it is sitting in Melbourne.) The
Queensland railways are part of the working plant
of a public estate of 403 million acres, never to be
alienated (we do not sell, as N. S. Wales did last
year, £1,249,761 worth of State lands and put the
proceeds into revenue). To help settlement our rail-
ways impose the lowest of railway fares and freights,
while paying their staffs the best wages and giving
them the sho test hours and best conditions in Aus-
tralia. As examples of fares and freights in Queens-
land, the first-class single fare for 50 miles is
9s. 4d., and the second-class single fare for 400
miles is 365. (intermediate fares for both classes
corresponding), as against N. S. Wales 11s. and
60s. 9d. ; Victoria, 9s. 9d. and 425. Bd. ; S.A.,
9s. 9d. and 525.; W.A., Bs. 4d. and 41s. Bd. Cattle
freights per head for 500 miles: Queensland, 18s. 3d.;
N.S.W., 395. lid.; Victoria, 42 s. 2d.; S.A., 375.
lOd.; W.A., 45s lOd. Sheep per head for 600 miles:
Queensland, 2s. 3.2 d.; N. S. Wales, 3s. 2.47 d. ; Vic-
toria, ss. 0.66 d. ; S.A., 3s. 6.25 d. ; W.A., 4s. 7.7 d.
The figures of area under crop in proportion to
population (1036 acres, as compared with 2938 in
Victoria) exclude the fact that Queensland Is a pas-
toral State—Queensland has 64 million cattle to
Victoria’s 14 million, and 174 million sheep to
Victoria’s 12. The superior figures of Queensland’s
dairy production are also not quoted.
u Similarly with the charge that Queensland is the
“lowest for progress in manufactures,” there is
no mention of the total value of Queensland factory
output per factory employee being £l6B greater
than in Vie., and but £3O bejiind the output per
factory employee in N. S. Wales. The fact that
Queensland is higher in annual wages per factory
employee than either Vic. or Tas. is not mentioned
either. Also, Queensland is highest in average
weekly rate of general wages —£4 16s, Bd. as
against £4 15s. lOd. in N. S. Wales; Vic., £4 13s.
7d- 5 S.A., £4 9s. 5d.; W.A., £4 155.; and Tas.,
£4 11s. Bd. The Queensland worker is thus 3s.
Id. a week better off than the Victorian, and in
addition only 30s. 3d. of his money is required to
buy commodities that, in Victoria, cost 345. lOd.;
in N.S.W., 345. 6d. ; S.A., 335. 4d. ; W.A., 325. 2d. ;
and Tasmania 355. Bd. These are 1922 figures ; the Sep-
tember quarter of 1923 shows that it now costs the
following amounts to buy what £1 bought in 1911:
Brisbane, 345. 5d.; Adelaide, 3:Bs. Bd. ; Perth, 355.
3d., Hobart, 40s. 6d. ; Sydney, 40s. 5d.; Melbourne,
41s. 6d.
The charge that Queensland is “lowest but one in
its contributions per head to the common or Federal
fund” is again answered by the fact of area. Vic-
toria s postal costs, with double the population of
Queensland, are £1,950,984 as against Queensland’s
£1,200,158 —just the difference between 87,000 sq.
miles and 670,000. It is greater area and conse-
quently costlier mail service that makes- N. S. Wales
with 600,000 more people than Victoria, show a net
postal profit of £182,000 less than Victoria. West-
ralia has, quite understandably, never shown a profit.
South Aus., which is half the area of Queensland
and has 270,000 less of population, shows a postal
profit of £187,936 to Queensland’s £143,844; and
here again density of population is the answer. Of
S.A.’s population, 51.584 per cent, lives in Adelaide;
but only 28.27 of Queensland’s live in Brisbane
Tfie statement that Queensland is “the lowest save
two for savings-bank deposits per head” is true; but
it does not mean what The Bulletin imputes
Queensland leads in the amount to credit of savings-
bank depositors—£s6 16s. Bd. against £5O 19s
4d. in N. S. Wales; £45 13* 2d. in Victoria; £4l
12s. Id. m S.A.; £35 ss. lOd. in W.A. ; and £36
os. 3d. in Tasmania. Proportionately to population
Queensland has but 425 savings-bank depositors com-
pared with 698 in Victoria; 536 in N. S. Wales • 798
in S.A.; 652 in W.A. and 545 in Tas. But the
amount of deposits in cheque banks supplies the rea-
T;™ U ™ nSland deposits in ch e<iue banks are
£47,629,000, as compared with £107,676,000 in
N. S. Wales, £85,756,716 in Vic. (with double
Queensland s population), £22,000,000 in SA
£12,248,000 in W.A., and £7,736,000 in Tas. Thus
Queensland has more private money on deposit pro-
portionately to population than any other State.
The higher cost of administration and develop-
ment m larger areas answers the charge of “highest
in taxation”; the mere statement of expenditure
per head is misleading.
charge of “top place for unemployed,” let
the Commonwealth Statistician reply in his figures of
percentage of trades-unionists unemployed in the
third and fourth quarters of 1922 and the first and
second quarters of 1923:

Read these -with the excess of arrivals over depar-
tures for last year-greater in Queensland than in
any other of the Australian States—and add
j? ihe sum the fact of floating labor from
the Southern States (shearers at the higher award
and sugarfield- and mill-hands, and the nomads
attracted to . Queensland by the higher wages and
better conditions), and the higher figures of unem-
ployment amount to nothing.
Af to tJle P astor al rents, the facts are that in
1905 a squatter Government repudiated earlier pastoral
legislation, extended its leases, and limited the
assessibility of rents. In the result the foreign
pastoral company was paying a halfpenny an acre
101 land exactly similar to, and in many cases ad-
joining, grazing farms which were paving two-
pence. The average of squatter rentals (mostly to
absentee companies) was 16s. Bd. per mile •* the
average rentals of Australians who considered
Queensland good enough to live in was 695. a mile,
the monstrous injustice of it was seen by the Den-
ham Government, which introduced its own repudia-
tion Act (after Federal Chief Justice Griffith had
reported in favor of its justice and legality), and
dropped it when the pastoral companies waved the
big stick. By the Labor Government’s legislation
no lease was “broken.” No lease was even touched;
only the squatter Government’s Act of Parliament
was amended. Rents were not “raised out of
sight”; the Land Courts heard evidence and re-
assessed them to something like decency. To illus-
trate: in the next three years 3:1 million acres,
held mostly by absentee pastoral companies, will fall
in. The aggregate rental of this area’ prior to
the alleged Repudiation Act was £9956; the new
rental ordered by the Land Court is £22,032; and
the rental from grazing farms that will replace
these sqnattages will be £54,000.

To which the author of the article re-
plies :
The threadbare tale about Queensland having so
much more railway in proportion to population
than other States is irrelevant. The point is that,
whether large or small, Denham and Co. made it
the best-paying system in Australia, and Rvan,
Theodore and Co. made it the worst, the slump
starting with their first year. Westralia has more
railway per inhabitant, yet produces better results.
The other figures are mere verbiage.
According to the tables on page 3X7 of the newest
Federal “Official Year Book” (No. 16) the Queens-
land charge on the “highest class freight” is, for
every distance up to 400 miles, the highest among
the States, and the Queensland charge on “lowest-
class freight” is the highest at every distance —
30s. 3d. for 500 miles against 12s. 4d., 12s. sd. and
12s. Bd. for N. S. Wales, Westralia and Victoria
respectively. Rates for agricultural produce are
low, but, then, Queensland isn’t agricultural, and
the rates serve for window-dressing. Presumably, in
the absence of evidence, the yarn about “the best
wages” is in the same category with that about
the lowest freights.
The fact that Queensland, with eight times the
area of Victoria, and being a State which specialises
in the pastoral business, has nearly twice as many
cattle and sheep as* its small neighbor, who doesn't
specialise in the pastoral job, is freely admitted.
It is a rotten situation for Queensland.
All the long-winded irrelevance that is possible
concerning the size of Queensland and the effect
of size on the postal revenue doesn’t alter the fact
that the “Official Year Book” No. 15, which was the
latest authority when I wrote on the subject, de-
clared that, for the last year covered by the returns,
South Aus. contributed to the Federal revenue
£73,396 more than Queensland in the shape of
probate duties ( £171,460 as compared with Queens-
land’s £98,064), £112,787 more in income-tax,
£21,470 more as war-time profits tax, and £80,282
more as land tax. Yet S.A. is 290,000 sq. miles
smaller than Queensland, has 1 a quarter-million less
people, and ranks as the most barren of the States.
If a worse advt. for Theodore’s administration is
possible I would like to hear about it.
The table on page 16 of the last “Quarterly
Statistics” (June, 1923) still says that Queensland,
the place which Theodore, according to his rapt
worshippers, has made a sort of paradise, pays less
wages per factory-worker than N. S. Wales, S. Aus-
tralia or Westralia, and less than the Australian
average.
The facts remain that Queensland makes the
very poorest showing of all the States for manu-
facturing progress, also for cultivated area in pro-
portion to population, and for the worker’s share
of the value he creates by factory labor, and that
it is lowest save two for savings-bank deposits per
inhabitant. Also, it is top save one for debt in
proportion to population, absolute top for taxation,
and it was elevated under Theodore to top place for
unemployed, though there have been occasional fluc-
tuations.
I admire Mr. Bedford’s statement that “the ex-
cess of arrivals over departures last year” was
“greater in Queensland than in any other of the
Australian States.” The table on page 4 of the
“Quarterly Statistics” already quoted says that the
gain in this way was, for 1922, 7388 in Queensland,
8952 in N. S. Wales and 18,427 in Victoria. These
figures seem to have been revised, for a table on
page 918 of the new “Official Year Book” says for
1922: Queensland, 7224; N. S. Wales, 9012; and
Yictoria, 18,400.
Of course, as Mr. Bedford says, “no lease was
broken,” if smashing the rent covenant into atoms
wasn’t breakage. And, of course, Denham meant to
do the same thing, if Mr. Bedford says so, the
Federal Chief Justice having apparently resumed Bar
practice sufficiently to advise on the matter. Queens-
land, in 1921-22, raised more than twice as much
land revenue per head as the Australian average
(40s. 3d. against an Australian average of 17s. 5d.)
as the result of its repudiation, but it had the usual
deficit, and the game didn’t seem to pay, after all.
I wonder if Mr. Bedford thinks he is doing his
patron any good by his figures. And I wonder if Mr.
Theodore thinks Mr. Bedford is doing him any good.
AUSTRALIA AND THE SHAMBLES.
Uifjrii. someone discovers what life is it is
difficult to set any standard of right or
wrong in the matter of the slaughter of
animals. Man has been killing for his living
for a long time; though there seems to be a
doubt as to whether in his first upright tail-
less period he did any killing at all. He
may, in fact, have been a nut-eater until that
first terrible ice-cap crept down upon Europe
and Asia and drove him to hunt over the
frozen wilds for anything that would sustain
life. All this is largely guess-work ; but man
emerges in the prehistoric period laid partly
bare by the archaeologist as a killer who
always sought for other food to limit the
necessity for killing. The most highly de-
veloped races of modern civilisation having
been also the chief killers, it was only natu-
ral that the habit should continue to spread;
but there is no good reason for thinking that
the higher civilisation itself had much to do
with the killing. As a matter of fact, things
were almost reversed in the ancient civilisa-
tions. "Chough not vegetarians, the meat
actually consumed by the peoples of Egypt,
the Euphrates Talley and Greece was not
large. The terrific fighting Spartans could
send 300 braves to meet the hosts of Persia
on a diet of beans and onions, with a few
dried fruits and a little honey thrown in to
keep their hearts up. Blood and slaughter
were marks of the temple rather than of the
ordinary economy of life. All Jerusalem
reeked with the smell of roast bullock and
half-burnt goat, but the flesh was only for
the priest. So the paradox holds that the
tastes of man have inclined more to the
savagery of the beast of prey as he has in-
creased in knowledge and culture.
Whatever may be the true nature of life,
and how far it may be worthy of praise or
blame to slaughter living creatures, are ques-
tions that do not touch the main point that
the infliction of pain is a distressing fact
of modern life. To what extent the broken
moth may suffer rve cannot guess: but we
can guess and guess pretty shrewdly what
the higher animals suffer. Their nervous
organisation is too much like our own to
leave room for reasonable doubt. That the
infliction of the pain that goes to the modern
diet and plays so large a part in our econo-
mic system is a cause of loss to the human
race seems to need hardly any argument. It
may be in large measure necessary; but face
to face with the shambles, we are forced to
admit that it does not fit our ideal concep-
tion of things. As our ideals are. after all,
our chief human asset, it follows that what-
ever lowers them —as the infliction of pain
certainly does—is not good for us as a race.
From that it may be reasonably argued that
the less killing we do and the less cruel
preparation for killing we go in for the better
it must be for us in the long run. go the
question of killing need not be dealt with
on any arbitrary moral grounds, but purely
as a matter of loss and gain. If some ideal
we have set before us of the w*\y in which a
human life ought to be lived is smirched or

degraded by our mode of living we are the
losers by it; and our aim should be to mini-
mise that loss. If history shows one thing
clearly it is that the constant sight of
the physical pain of human beings, led to
racial degradation and even physical in-
feriority. The cruel races of the world went
most rapidly to their doom, though the
cruelty was in every case excused on the
ground that it was necessary for the protec-
tion of society. In minimising cruelty to
human beings the reasons formerly alleged
as excuse for the cruelty more and more
ceased to exist. When torture ceased brutal
crime automatically diminished because the
human mind was lifted from an attitude of
social hate in which the very shames it
sought formerly to extirpate by torture had
been bred and fostered. To argue that suni-
lar reform directly affecting tlie dinner-table
could have similar results may seem bizarre;
but if the race is actually losing something
by tlie dinner-table the sooner we face the
truth the better. To put tlie thing in its
simplest and plainest setting, let us ask one
question: How long will any section of the
rising race of men endure being turned into
mere shedders of blood and inflicters of pain
for the supposed benefit of the rest?
That Australia probably eats far too much
meat in sucli a summer climate as our own
will be accepted without discussion. We
have brought our habits, like our clothing,
from the colder countries; and for long it
was far easier to kill a sheep than grow a
cabbage. But our own habits are not the
really"important matter; it is our economic
dependence as a nation upon an overwhelm-
ing amount of pain and suffering that really
counts. We do not merely cause infinite
suffering for our needs, but we have chosen
lastly to increase that suffering for our gains.
As long as sheep and cattle are mere figures
on paper, mere statistical returns from our
pastoral areas, the force of this is not seen :
it is when the agonies of multitudinous
slaughter and preparation for slaughter touch
our imaginations that the dreadful nature of
our export trade in meat begins to be plain.
It is not a question whether such a trade is
right or wrong by any arbitrary code of
ethics, but a question whether it is good for
us or bad. So largely lias our national life
been made to depend on the economically-
organised agony of sensitive living creatures
that we seem to exist in the very atmosphere
of slaughter—or, rather, we live by shutting
our eyes to that slaughter, though we can
never wholly forget its existence. Those
who are not yet alive to the meaning and
importance of Australian industry may well
ponder these things. It is really a question
whether we are to go on and make the things
of beauty and use which our people need
and must more and more demand, or whether
we are to remain the world’s chief slaughter-
men, walking in blood and perpetually in-
flicting pain. To be mere hewers of wood
and drawers of water for the more advanced
nations would be bad enough; but to accept
as our main task tlie job from which all the
rest of the world shrinks is infinitely worse,
the more so because Australians are idealists
beyond all tlie others. The work of killing
is, in fact, the slave’s work; and with only
the traditional heritage of the butcher’s knife
nothing could make our children free. It
is surely far better to let every nation do its
own share of its own dirtiest work and press
on to some sort of human achievement. The
slaughter of an animal is not an achieve-
ment ; it is at best a deplorable necessity.
But in the making of a roll of good cloth,
the turning out of a fine piece of pottery
or the building of an engine there is a
triumph of real skill and mental power. It
is by such triumphs multiplied over a whole
continent that we can justify our national
existence. If we cannot reduce the number
of creatures we are forced to kill, let us at
least lower the proportional importance of
the dreadful task in the place it fills in our
total national effort.

The Voice of Australia.
General Monash, whose blistering remarks
about Australia’s undefended condition
attracted attention last week, is not a poli-
tician, and being out of the army —except
to the shadowy extent that he belongs to our
“legion that never was listed,” the Reserve
—he has nothing to gain from increased de-
fence expenditure. In short, he personi-
fies the intelligent and patriotic civilian.
This class of private citizen approaches the
defence issue in a spirit of sincerity, thereby
painfully disconcerting a number of public
men, Labor and anti-Labor, who exploit de-
fence for the purposes of internationalist or
Imperialistic caut, as the case may be. Par-
liamentary Labor’s arguments have all been
stated of late by Matthew Charlton, M.P.
He observed last week that "this was a
time when Australians should talk of peace
instead of armaments.” He told Parliament
that “the Japanese and other excluded
Asiatic peoples would become more friendly
from day to day with a Labor Government
in power.” In any event, there was
no need for Australia to arm on land
or sea. “The truth was that any
neople fighting in their own country
became imbued with a giant strength.” Also,
the people behind the defence movement were
"anti-Labor brass-liats in search of lucra-
tive billets for themselves.” The anti-Labor
arguments are a shade more subtle. Hos-
tility to the R.A.N. is represented as the
truest Imperial patriotism. A speaker at the
last convention of the Australian National
Defence League said it was “a waste of
money for Australia to maintain a navy, and
that the Admiralty would be very glad to
see local navies abolished.” (A few days
later Earl Beatty was to say at the Guild-
hall: “1 wish to make it clear that the Admi-
ralty definitely favors the development of
dominion navies” ; but even if the critic of
the R.A.N. had known that fact it would not
have silenced him.) Next, the need of a
naval base in the Pacific is admitted; but
it must not be at Singapore. Singapore is
affirmed to be unsuitable on Imperial
grounds, being unhealthy, a poor anchorage
and in a strategically bad position. Why
not, it is asked, a salubrious harbor remote
from the possibility of attack, such- as Port
Stephens (N.S.W.) ? And as for compul-
sory training, it is “an expensive farce,” and
since the trainees are unnecessary a staff
to direct their work is also superfluous, Aus-
tralia has nearly half a million ex-members
of the A.I.P. ready to leap to arms if ever
the Commonwealth or the Empire is men-
aced. Why, then, apply the un-British
principle of conscription to our lads? The
Monash attitude is the antithesis of all
such disingenuous efforts to > sidestep the
national duty. He knows that the fraction
of the A.I.F. (about a third) which emerged
from the World War medically fit will not be
of fighting value much longer, and that, any-
how, there are neither arms nor ammunition
for them. He also knows that the British
taxpayers will never consent to their Govern-
ment contributing to a base at (say) Port
Stephens (the whole of the Admiralty ex-
perts having declared for Singapore), and
that the Australian taxpayers will never con-
sent to an adequate contribution to the R.N.
For practical purposes, then, there is only
one way to defend Australia: by co-ordi-
nating our military training with that of the
British Army (the liaison being maintained
by a local staff) and by co-operating at sea
with the R.N. through our own navy, as we
did throughout the war. All other schemes,
whether they relate to defence or to paci-
fism, are shams based on the assumption
that with the British people spending
265. Bd. a head per annum on the R.N. alone
we can safely dodge our responsibilities. The
politicians’ view prevails at present; yet it
is safe to say that Monash’s view is that of
Australia.
a,
The Financial Lee Shore.
Treasurer Cocks, who struggles with the
morbid finances of N.S.W., and finds little
joy in the process, laid bare the past, the
present and the future in a recent interview,
but propounded no remedy, badly as they all
need one. First he showed the degenera-
tion of the State’s credit, which may be
illustrated by these extracts from the last
10 years’ record
Interest Bill. Interest per cent.
1913-14. . £4,086,200 £3 13s. 4d.
1917-18.. 5,502,255 4 3s. 6d.
1922-23.. 8,383,714 5 3s. 3d.
That was pretty bad, and the i reasurer
made the prospect no gladder with the news
that the interest rate was likely to rise con-
siderably yet. and that the worst is to come.
This appears probable, for there are great
possibilities about a State which (1) floats
the biggest new loans when interest is
highest, and (2) when wages are also
highest, so that it gets the minimum of return
for its loan money, and (3) simultaneously
renews old loans at the lender’s terms, hav-
ing made no provision for repayment. It
would have been pleasant if the dispirited
financier had added that his Government was
establishing a solid sinking fund even now,
for the 24th hour is better than no hour at
all; but there was no silver lining of that
sort. Instead the Treasurer grieved that he
could do nothing: lie could not even
stop the big costly public works policy,
because it was necessary to find work
for a great mass of unskilled laborers.
But those unskilled laborers will yet have to
be dealt with in some other way than this.
Under the present system not only has the
unskilled person to be provided with public
works till he retires on the old age pension,
but he bequeaths the claim to be provided
with public works to his children, who are
apt to grow up like himself, depending on the
family’s vested interest in public works for a
livelihood. Then the works themselves are
liable to be a disaster after they are finished
as well as while they are in progress. For
instance, these are some of the railways
which N.S.W. bought with this mostly un-
skilled labor from 1918 onwards, with a state-
ment of what they did last year:—

Three very small lines were constructed dur-
ing the same period which apparently paid
—at least they don’t figure on the list of
losses. Those shown above are the other 19.
As they mostly lead nowhere and don’t pay,
the question arises whether it wouldn’t be
better and cheaper to go in for straight-
out poor relief as is done in Britain, where
the payments to the unemployed have aver-
aged over £4,000.000 per month for nearly
three years. Charitable aid has at least the
advantage that it dies with the recipient,
while “reproductive works” of the Australian
pattern can go on losing money long after
the person who was paid to build them is
dust. One result of that is increased taxes;
another is that the average charge for the
use of the railways has been pushed up in
five years from Ts. 9d. per ton per 100 miles
to 13s. 4d., the minority of good lines hav-
ing to pay for the majority of bad ones. And
this means that the railway system becomes
a positive discourager of settlement. If
four-fifths of the Public Loan Works machine
was dismantled it would save the cost of
materials; it would save such permanent
after-losses as that on the Demondrille-
Blayney line, which drops £123,000 per
annum without turning a hair; and it would
save at least part of the wage bill. Unem-
ployed relief money is never given on a full-
wage scale, nor is it given for 52 weeks in
the year, nor is it given, as a rule, to any
save’ fixed residents. Having put things on
this basis the community, in addition to sav-
in <>■ money, would have a chance to realise
the situation, the gigantic State-aid system
beino- no longer disguised as a great and
wise° policy for the development of the re-
sources of’the country. Then a torpid com-
munity might wake to the urgent necessity
for industrial education to absorb the popu-
lation which hitherto was encouraged to drop
into loampaid. and. dead-end occupations.
Crooked Railways and Very Crooked
Policies.
Thomas Waddell, a former N. S. Wales
Treasurer, performed something of a feat in
Sydney Telegraph the other morning. His
name appeared over an article in which he
demanded a Federal railway to connect Syd-
ney, via the decayed town of Bourke, which
was his own original constituency, and the
dry regions of West Queensland, with Dar-
win. And he managed to fill a lot of space
without once touching on the fact that the
Commonwealth holds the Territory only be-
cause South Australia handed it over as the
endowment of a land-grant railway which
the Commonwealth undertook to construct
“in- South Australia proper, from any point
on the Port Augusta railway to a point on
the northern boundary line of South Aus-
tralia proper, to connect with that part of
the transcontinental railway to be built in
the Northern Territory from Darwin south-
wards to the northern boundary of South
Australia proper, and to maintain and work
such railway when constructed.” That is so
explicit that it can’t be explained away, so
it is simply ignored. Thus Mr. Waddell’s
scheme is to keep the land-grant and build
the Federal line through N. S. Wales and
Queensland, while making S.A., as a member
of the Commonwealth, liable for its share of
the cost of being robbed. And the only ex-
cuse for the . robbery is that the two big
States have sufficient votes to carry the
robbery through. Their position is that of
the big ruffian whose reply to a charge of
unfairness was simple and primitive: “I’m
bigger than you. I don’t need to be fair.”
This sort of thing would only be possible
in States where political morality was at
a pitiably low ebb, and where truth, honor
and good faith had, in very many cases, come
to rank as foolish and superfluous baggage.
In fact, the theory is so widely accepted
that an individual may. in political life,
commit breaches of faith which would be
regarded as utterly disgraceful and contempt-
ible if done in a commercial capacity, that
argument isn’t directed to explaining away
the proposed lie and fraud, but rather to
making some kind of a case in support of
the theory that the fraud will pay. Hence
statements such as this: —
Practical men realise that there is only one way
to develop the Northern Territory, namely by giving
it direct rail communication with Sydney, the
greatest city and the greatest market in Australia,
and by connecting this main line with the three
great Queensland lines —the Brisbane, the Rockhamp-
ton and the Townsville. The East and South-East
of Australia have about six-sevenths of the popula-
tion, etc., etc.
“Practical men” of the kind that anyone
can find or invent by dozens also “realise”
that the only way to develop any place is
by “giving it direct rail communication with
Sydney”; yet the number of towns fairly
close at hand which are stagnating or even
sinking into decay at the other end of that
same “direct rail communication” with Syd-
ney is something considerable. It is true
that the Territory wants better communica-
tion with some decent sort of city. Rut
Darwin, being a tropical port with hopes
of doing a trade with Asia and Europe, fails
to see what it would gain by being connected
with Townsville and Rockhampton, two
small and inferior ports, which are tropical
also, and have the same ambitions as Dar-
win, but are not nearly so w r ell situated for
carrying them out. Nor does it see anything
wonderful in the proposed connection with
Brisbane, which is much further away than
Adelaide is, and very much further away
than Port Augusta (S.A.), the Territory’s
natural southern outlet; which, moreover,
is further from Europe by sea —a matter of
some account when importing and exporting
are considered. As for the proposed linking
with Sydney, if a straight line is drawn on
the map it will be found that that city is
hundreds of miles further from the nearest
Territory point than Adelaide, as well as
being, when reached, 1000 miles more remote
from Europe by sea. The proposed Waddell
railway would, in short, give the northern
part of the Territory a line to one of the
remotest capitals on the mainland, and would
leave the centre and the cool south of the
Possession with no more means of communi-
cation than they have now. It would pro-
bably pay no better and promote development
no better, by reason of its absurd length and
its absurd crookedness, than the 54 lines
(8134 miles of them), all affording “direct
rail communication with Sydney” and all
losing money, which cost the N. S. Wales
taxpayer £1,106,881 in shortages last year.
Still, it seems to be considered by some
people that certain loss and failure, with
disgrace thrown in, are better in the Ma
State than success with an honest observ-
ance of contracts anywhere else.
•
Old Loans and New Frills.
The present N. S. Wales Government prides
itself on being an improvement on its pre-
decessor, and as the predecessor had hardly
a redeeming feature the claim may be
allowed without involving any extravagant
praise. The finances are better, to the
extent that the accounts show a surplus,
while all Golconda couldn’t have prevented
the old gang closing the year with a shortage.
But the financial principles haven’t changed
much. The trouble with all gangs here-
abouts is the unanimous belief that going
into debt, and getting deeper into debt, and
staying in debt, and never getting out
of ' debt is the sure road to pros-
perity. One gang may do the business
with less scandal, loss and corruption
than another, but that is the only difference.
The Ma State has made up its accounts to
June 30, and finds that it has spent
£38,485,000 of loan money in three . years.
The improvement lies in the fact that the
first (or Dooley) year of the series accounted
for 154 millions, while the last (or Fuller)
year was responsible for only lOf millions.
When the “blewing” of lOf millions of the
most expensive loan money that the State
lias handled since Responsible Government
commenced, all in one year and for a mere
handful of people, is called reform, the rot-
tenness of unreformed things is obvious. The
results don’t include any of the signs of
progress that are looked for in an almost
empty country; no, jpew city, town or port
has developed, and the, population remains
huddled in the same old corner. But there
have been changes. The annual interest
bill has grown by nearly 50 per cent. The
average railway charge for the conveyance
of a ton of goods 100 miles, which was down
as low as 7s. 9d., went up to 13s. 4d. because
the money-losing lines built with ruinously
expensive loans had to live on something.
Though the policy of carrying wheat, flour,
etc. (“up journey,” or journey towards Syd-
ney only) at a loss was maintained to save
the State’s principal vegetable, even the
wheat rate was reluctantly raised from 3s.
Id. to os. 6d. per ton per 100 miles, so the
opening of uew loan railways to open new
agricultural country proved bad for agricul-
ture. The area under crop began to dimin-
ish almost coincidently with the beginning
of the really heroic “settlement” boom, one
explanation being that the appalling cost
of theoretical settlement, as conducted
by city politicians, made real settle-
ment more unpromising and difficult.
If there is anything in the supersti-
tion that loan works are a remedy for unem-
ployment, that kind of trouble should have
ceased ; but it certainly hasn’t. In fact,
the Labor leaders who inaugurated the
present extra-special borrowing madness
swear that unemployment is worse than
ever. Yet so mischievous is the loan-spend-
ing habit that if the loan works ceased there
would be a still larger and more dangerous
crowd of the worst sort of unemployed. A
further remarkable effect of the habit is the
depression that has fallen on certain manu-
factures. Foreign loans, if they arrive here
in any tangible shape at all, arrive in the
form of goods. Therefore big foreign loan
times are always big importing times, no
matter what tariffs may do, and the rush of
foreign goods tends to push local ones off
the market, thus creating more unemploy-
ment and depression. During the first three
months of the present borrowing year, goods
to the value of over 14 millions were shot
into the Ma State, while the exports, which
should have been sufficient to pay for them
and also cover the quarter’s interest bill,
were a mere 6f millions. A whole lot of
new debt, new taxes and new unemployment
were expressed in these figures. The same
signs are visible all over Australia. The
need of every State is to find a Governnient
which will taper off the loan policy till it
is extinct, and then keep it extinct. But
instead of any move being apparent in this
direction, the Conference at which Prime
Minister Bruce has been shining in London
has devised a new and extra-pernicious frill
with which to aggravate the case. It may
be called the Double Postponement Curse,
the idea being to smooth the way of the
borrower by not only postponing payment of
the principal (the common or garden loan
does that), but also putting off most of the
interest. The idea is that, when any State,
say in Australia, wants a loan for “develop-
ment” works, and the obliging central Gov-
ernment approves, the British Government,
on due consideration, will pay as much as
three-quarters of the interest for the first
five years—provided the material is bought
in Britain. It reads like a desperate,
crooked, reckless effort to alleviate the wreck-
age of industry in a Freetrade land, and
this view is supported by the statement that
preference will be given not so much to the
best schemes as to those which rush in their
orders first. The proposition has these out-
standing features: —
It will facilitate borrowing, for even a partial
guarantee, good for five years, is better than no
guarantee at all.
It will encourage borrowing, for the loan Govern-
ment of the moment will only have to face ona-
quarter of the trouble of finding the interest, and
the Government of five years ahead can hoe its own
row when the shock and the awakening come.
It is likely to be very bad for Australian industry,
the importation of material for these loan works
being a sine qua non. And it isn’t likely to be at
all good for Australian pioneering, for the same
old brand of Government will doubtless spend the
new loans, like the old ones have been spent, on
bloating the little group of capitals.
Probably the least intelligent comment on
the nefarious scheme was that contained in
a Sydney Telegraph leading article: —
As the Dominion Governments, after the five
years expire, will have to shoulder the whole interest,
it may be assumed that they will take care to cer-
tify only such enterprises as promise to become self-
supporting in that time.
Just as the incipient criminal, being assured
that the police wouldn’t begin to inquire
about the body for five years, would naturally
decide to lead a strictly upright life, whereas
if told that they would be on his track imme-
diately lie would rush to wallow in gore.

The Importance of Beer.
A Westralian Reduction Board has ordered
the delicensing of 29 seedy pubs in and about
Hannan-street, Kalgoorlie, and Burt-street,
Boulder. In passing sentence the Board
intimated that it would have been delighted
to condemn a few more, only—the reduction
system being a recent arrival in Jimmy
Mitchell’s State —the compensation fund
wouldn’t stand it. Hitherto the supply of
licensed houses in Kalgoorlie and Boulder —
they are practically one town, living on the
same lot of mines—lias been determined by
popular favor, with results that were posi-
tivelv freakish. For 15 years at least, the
one industry that keeps the places alive has
been on the down-grade. For all those years,

witli costs increasing and returns diminish-
ing always, it has been burdened with the
support of from 30 to 50 unnecessary hotels,
selling beer and spirits at inflated prices, and
there have been superfluous wineshops and
breweries as well as unnecessary hotels. In
1903 or thereabouts a publican who had
quarrelled with the local beer-foundries
brought down the tariff from 6d. to 4d. per
glass, getting his supply from Northam, 300
miles away. Announcing that a decent profit
could be made on beer at 4d., he called upon
the workers of the district to support him.
They “supported” him with a boycott, on the
baffling ground that if the price of beer came
down wages would come down also ! When
someone pointed out that every excessive tup-
pence shot into the cash-register was, in
effect, a tax on the mines—mines without
which Ivalgoorlie and Boulder would be-
come desert again—the workers replied
that they would rather let Bung have
the tuppence than the blasted mine-
owner, anyhow. So the innovator was
starved into submission, beer was again sold
at 50 per cent, more than a fair price, and
the life of the mines was shortened to the
extent of the difference. Nowadays such of
the mines as have kept going employ 50 or
60 per cent, less labor than they did in 1911.
The industry is declared to be in such a state
that, unless it is exempted from income-taxes
and customs duties, it may perish. But
the dingy and parasitic grogshop has lingered
on. During the war, when Melbourne and
Sydney shut their bars at 6 p.m., and Perth
at 9 p.m., Ivalgoorlie and Boulder voted for
11 o’clock closing. At the 1921 local-option
poll, while districts with one hotel declared
for reduction, Ivalgoorlie and Boulder, with
their ruinous surplus of broken-down boozing-
dens, polled large majorities for continuance.
It has been reserved for an unprejudiced
Board to rid this goldfields community of an
incubus from which, heedless of cold economic
facts, and distrustful .'like of the boss and
the wowser, it has been unwilling to deliver
itself. More was thus done in a few hours
on the reduction-of-licenses principle than has
ever been effected by the discredited local-
option method.

In Massey’s Country.
William Ferguson Massey, now doing his
twelfth year as Premier of Maoriland, made
some rather proud remarks at the Economic
Conference, and he really had more justifi-
cation than the average. No one who is a
slave to truth would call the public finances
of the Dominion sound, and a great deal of
the private finance is exceptionally racketty;
still, for 19 recent years running the Trea-
sury reported a surplus on revenue account,
and that is the sort of thing for which an
Australian Treasurer would certainly be
hounded out of office. Considerable public
works were paid for with these moneys, and (a
matter which seems past belief) some
£15,000,000 of debt was wiped off by means of
them. One result is that the Dominion’s rate
of interest is several shillings per cent, below
the Australian average; and as there is a
little over £7,500,000 of accumulated surplus
still on hand, and some £10,700,000 to the
credit of sinking funds, Maoriland hopestocon-
tinue to avoid being squeezed. In Australia in
1922 the States had a nominal £14.000,000
of sinking fund among them; but this was
practically obliterated by £12,800,000 of
accumulated deficit —six States and six
accumulated deficits. Further, Massey’s
country didn’t celebrate the war by an issue
of Government notes. Hughes, who missed
no chances, did so in Australia to such pur-
pose that his Government at one time had
the use of some £32,000,000 without interest
and without security. As Maoriland hasn’t
exploited this branch of finance yet it has
something in reserve, in addition to the accu-
mulated surplus and the sinking fund, for
renewal day. During the period from 1886
to 1921 there were only four years in which
exports did not pay for imports and leave
a substantial balance over with which to
meet other liabilities. This explains why the
increase in foreign debt during recent years,
apart from some war lOLJ’s, lias been in-
finitesimal ; and that in turn may also help
to explain an interest rate on the public debt
of £4 6s. lid. per cent., while N. S. Wales
paid £5 Is. 3d. per cent, and sees £5 10s. per
cent, looming.

The Holiday Spirit.
The N. S. Wales Government decided to
gazette December 31 as a public holiday, and
narrowly missed doing the same by December
24. There is no reason founded on either prac-
tical necessity or religious sentiment for a
State-wide downing of tools on New Year’s
Eve. For some time past sections of the popu-
lace in various Australian cities have made
a practice of conducting mild saturnalias hi
the streets at midnight of the last day of
the year, with the eventual result that the
police had to interfere. But similar cele-
brations are general on Christmas Eve, so
that the Government, if it is logical, will
shortly yield to those l who want December
24 made a day of loafing and hilarity, too —
the principle apparently being that it is
no use expecting anyone to be serious on
occasions when some feel frivolous. On this
thoroughly rotten basis the tally of public
holidays might be extended almost indefi-
nitely. Candlemas is still held in high esteem
by R.C’s. and some Anglicans: Michaelmas
is an important day in the estimation of
immigrant rustics from England, and
Lammas, St. Swithin’s, Lady Day and St.
Valentine’s Day are red-letter events in the
calendars of others. In Merrie England,
when the population was small, when the
land produced enough food fd>r all, and when
the monastery- and cathedral-building indus-
tries absorbed any labor which happened to
be unemployed elsewhere, there was a ten-
dency to add continually to the list of public
holidays. Certain tribes in Central Africa
still maintain • this halcyon tradition, some
contriving to put in live days of celebration
or rest in every seven; and our brown
Kanaka friends of Papua and the Pacific
Islands are perfectly content to have six
holidays a week. But nations which have
complicated their existence by adopting the
manners and customs of modern civilisation
cannot afford it. Australia already loafs for
the best part of two days in every week of
every year. In addition, it stops work on
New Year’s Day and the day after; on
Christmas Day and the day after; from Good
Friday to the Wednesday following ; on Foun-
dation Day, Anzac Day, Eight Hours Day,
King’s Birthday and about a dozen more.

THE AUCTION OF SOULS.
“In the competition for loan money various States have now put up their offers to 5½ p.c. free of
income-tax; and the N.S.W. Treasurer expects that 6 p.c. will be offered presently.”
TTHE AUSTIONEER: “Bid up, bid up, gentlemen! Remember you don’t have to pay — I’ll
take tOU’s on your children. Bid up, bid up, gentlemen—how much am I
offered for another glass?”
cognised by statute are tacitly accepted as
holidays by the multitude, or most of it —
Melbourne Cup Week by Victoria, the Rand-
wick Spring Meeting by N. S. Wales, and
so on. Apart from the fact that the holi-
day-snatching habit is the sign manual of
a backward race (Turkey has 26 national
holidays per annum as against Scotland’s
three), there is the objection that a sur-
plusage of holidays constitutes a hardship
to all but a few privileged classes. A day
of rest that is play to a bachelor clerk on
a weekly salary may be death to the mar-
ried toiler on a piece-work job. But, above
all, Australia needs to remember that, in
addition to its heavy commitments for war
pensions and repatriation, it carries a debt
of over £900.000,000, the biggest burden of
the sort that has ever been sustained by a
nation of 5-1 million people, and a burden that
has been more than doubled in 10 years. In
the circumstances, Governments should be
looking round for public holidays to remove
from our already over-swollen list instead
of adding to the collection. They represent
the negation of the will to work at a time
when nothing is so nationally important as
work.
A week’s supply of information, mostly from
Hansard, for the 100,000 N. S. Wales elec-
tors who are struggling with their income-
tax papers:—
The Government timber yards at Uhl ’s Point, no v
closed down, cost £179,000, and were run at a loss
of £226,000, taxes not allowed for. When the
machinery was sold for what it would fetch bidding
was so poor that the auctioneer “boiled with indigna-
tion.” “I am here to give the stuff away,” he said,
“but not to throw it away.”
The Glenreagh-Dorrigo railway, still under con-
struction although it dates back to 1910, will cost
more than three times the estimated £400,000. In-
terest already piled up on the unfinished job amounts
to £150,000, and in 1922 it, cost £81,897 to
“repair damages.”
“Scandals have occurred in connection with the
construction of railways'. The timekeeper on one
line was also the paymaster (it is the same on
other works), and gangs of men that never existed
were on the pay-sheet for 12 months. There is so
much overlapping that the Railway Commissioners
don’t know who is employed and who is not. One
man was charged with embezzling £13,000, but the
amount was nearer £50,000.” Ratcmffe, Labor
M.L.A. for Botany, told his fellow members this;
and they took as much notice as if he had remarked
that it was a pleasant day.
A select committee was appointed, on the motion
of Lee. another Botany member, to inquire into and
report on the operations of the Government Housing
Board. According to Lee, there have been mysteri-
ous losses of material—“in one case over £13,000
worth is missing”—and many purchasers of Govern-
inent-built houses have been asked to pay from 50
to 80 p.c. more than the amounts stipulated. The
Government, he says, will have to make up the
difference.
The State Superannuation Board reports that the
Government owes the fund £2,473,947 in “undis-
charged liabilities” extending- over four years and
interest on these “unpaid contributions.”
“There is no question of a railway strike, but we
think the time has arrived when the big- political
forces of the organisation may be used, and we
propose to see that some redress of our grievances is
affected. This is the pleasant prospect held out bv
Buckley, acting-secretary of the Railway Employees'
Union.
There is no question about the public ser-
vants’ “big political forces.” Indeed, the
time has arrived when the rest of the com-
munity must decide whether it is content
that the servant shall be the master.
There is a lunatic consistency in the way
the Germans provide their hereditary enemy
with excuses for keeping them in subjection.
The Government deliberately defaulted with
its reparations payments at a time when the
money and material were available, and when
the French were obviously determined to aet
unless paid. This suicidal policy is under-
stood to have been framed by the great Jew
money-lords under the delusion that Britain
and America would place an effective moral
embargo on extreme action by France. Now
that France is in the Ruhr, other policies
equally suicidal are being experimented with
by other interested factions. The separa-
tists want to forget that there ever was a
German Empire; every other agitator for
the repudiation of the Reich apparently sees
himself as a dictator or powerful Minister
in embryo. The Berlin republicans are ready
to go to any extremes to retain power: they
quelled the Bavarian revolt by methods
which nearly succeeded with the French in
the Ruhr—by stopping the trains, disorgan-
ising the postal, telephone and telegraph
services, and so on. The communists, who
have been killing Berlin Jews and '“raiding
Jewish shops in various quarters, including
the fashionable district in the city,’’ have
also done good work for France and a rotten
service to German democracy. And as a
final blow to unity the Crown Prince has
returned bearing with him, for what it is
worth, the ex-Kaiser’s authorisation to
accept the throne if it is offered to him. The
appearance of a spirit of unity—social and
political, economic, racial and religious—
might still save Germany and bring dis-
comfiture on France. As it is the French
are able to point out. that the bankrupt not
only is drunk, but is irrationally destroying
the assets that represent his only security.

There are black blots; but taken generally
history offers no such record of progress.
The U.S.A. certainly doesn’t show it. In tin*
face of such figures how ridiculous is it to
buy the cheaper sort of immigrants at high
prices as a sort of last resource!
“Iford" is beset with doubt:—
I wonder if there really is much in the argument
or airy assurance, so often heard when the occupa-
tion of the Ruhr is discussed, that the French under-
stand the Germans better than anyone else can ever
expect to. Because two nations have lived next-door
for centuries and quarrelled incessantly and annoyed
and jumped on and bullied one another as often
as either was strong enough to do so, does it follow
that their knowledge of each other’s psychology i-
more accurate and profound than any outsider’s can
be? If it did, Englishmen would understand Irishmen,
and vice versa, with a completeness that nobody at
a distance could hope to approach. Yet there is
no article of belief more cherished by the great
majority of Irishmen than that the average English-
man is utterly incapable of understanding them,
and I’m not at all sure it isn’t true —while I
should be even less inclined to dispute the comple-
ment of the proposition. Do the Greeks understand
the Turks better than anyone else —or the Bulgar,
whom they are generally represented as hating more
desperately than they hate Abdul, possibly because
they have been longer located alongside him? Does
the Pole know all there is to learn about the
Russian merely because he may have more cause co
dislike him? Seems to me the mere fact that
you have been brought up to loathe a person (or
a nation) at close-range with all your heart and
soul is an excellent reason why your estimate of
him, and his of you, should be received by the
world outside with a deal of caution.
“O. Archibald”: “Head Collarer” (B.
25/10/’23) makes timely reference to the
lack of Government supervision over an “in-
dustry” that lends itself to child-slavery more
than any other in Australia — i.e., horse rac-
ing. I can assure him that rotten con-
ditions of employment are by no means con-
fined to the “pony” branch of the game. Ten
stables run by registered trainers are con-
stantly under my eye. Some of them house
their ““apprentices” in sheds which are not
considered sufficiently weatherproof to store
feed in. The lads are worked long hours,
often under the goad of nagging and coarse
oaths, and the food is sometimes so bad that
it would cause a riot or hunger strike in
Pentridge. It is safe to assume 90 per cent,
of labor in stables is done by lads under IT
who have little education. At 20 the majority
are too heavy to ride, and are emptied out.
a grade or two lower than the average un-
skilled dead-ender, to swell the ranks of
urgers, tipsters and card-and-book vendors.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The executive of the Primary Producers’
Association, the Country party’s organisa-
tion in Westralia, has withdrawn its endorse-
ment from Colonial Sec. Sampson and other
alleged Cockies remarkable only for their sub-
servience to Premier Mitchell. At its
annual conference the P.P.A. took a strong
stand against the Mitchell policy of setting
flocks of newchums to clear and farm heavily-
timbered land of unproved fertility, regard-
less of costs and markets. It now declares,
in effect, that it would rather lose seats than
assume responsibility for so-called Cockies.
(Sampson is a Perth printer.)
On a recurring “crisis” :
In the course of some confused proceedings in
the N. S. Wales Leg. Assembly—a bored committee
had been nodding through the local-government
estimates beyond the midnight hour—a division was
carried against Fuller’s Nationalists, in effect, the
business of the House was taken out of their hands.
Forthwith there was more weariful talk of a “crisis,”
of the undependableness of the Progressives, of an
early election designed to destroy that group, and
so on. Since Proportional Representation was thrust
upon a people that had never asked for it,. such
“crises” have become common. The inevitable
result of trying to govern on party lines without
a majority, “crises” can only be prevented by (11
the return of a dominant Labor party, or by (2)
a Nationalist-Progressive alliance, as in the Common-
wealth Parliament. Failing the second arrangement,
the other will arrive at the first appeal to the
country. Incidentally, the Progressives can supply
the element of which the Government’s need is the
sorest—the element of youth. There is too much
brake on the Ministerial coach —too many tired old
men who are afraid of their own shadows. The
driving power, if such it can be called, is supplied
by fluent lawyers, and this sick old world is dog-
weary of lawyer-politicians.
An unexpected item in the British Govern-
ment’s election programme is the proposal to
subsidise farms to the extent of 20s. per acre
per annum, provided the wages paid to laborers
thereon are not less than 30s. per week. In
a land where 32 bushels per acre is an average
crop, where the seasons vary so little that 28
bushels is bad and 35 bushels good, and where
the market is next door, one might expect
agriculture to struggle along on its. own. But
it is up against (1) enormous direct taxa-
tion, for out of £1,078,000,000 raised by.the
State and local bodies as taxes in 1922, Cus-
toms supplied only £130,000,000, or less than
one-eighth, and local taxation is mostly paid
by the tenant; (2) the necessity of support-
ing Lord Addlehede, the landlord. So Den-
mark grows rich on agriculture, and Britain
doesn’t..
Three years of unemployed relief on a
heroic scale may have created an aversion
to toil on the part of the British workman;
at any rate, Prime Minister Baldwin’s pro-
posals for supplying work by the same
methods which supply it rather successfully
in Prance and elsewhere arouse no enthusi-
asm in Parliamentary Labor circles. The
party’s first idea is a “levy on capital.” This
is simply more taxation exacted in a sudden
heap instead of being spread over an indefi-
nite number of years; but the sound of the
thing exercises a fascination somehow. John
Bull's chief imposts (estate duty, probate
duty, legacy duty, succession duty, corpora-
tion duty, land tax, house tax, property and
income tax and super-tax, and a lot more)
are all levies on capital. The difficulty about
any more stupendous levy is that capitalists
will have to sell property wholesale to pay
it-—already they have had to do it on a retail
scale —and when all capitalists are selling
prices drop to the value of an old song. The
party also proposes to be kinder to old ene-
mies like Germany and Russia, so that they
may be encouraged to send more goods to
compete in the open British market, and
undersell the British worker. After the pro-
ceeds of the levy are spent something will
presumably happen, but no one says what.
Speeding-up has begun in Vic. Assembly,
but it is hard to see how a summer session
can be avoided unless legislation labelled im-
portant when the Ministry was recon-
structed is to be jettisoned. Only four bills
of any importance have been passed m four
months— University, Metropolitan Drainage,
Murray River Waters and the Public Safety
bills, and the last-named may become a
dead letter. Nobody is proud of it, anyhow.
Premier Lawson has lost his punch, and
doesn’t seem to care who knows it.
As the outcome of some _ super-lieated
thrusts and counter-thrusts in the N. S.
Wales Assembly last week, R. E. O’Halloran
wrung from Treasurer Cocks the admission
that the latter’s chauffeur is not only paid but
insured bv the State. It is an interesting
example of the little side-lines by which poli-
ticians swell deficits in Australia. The Trea-
surer’s reason for needing a car (and for
r’eouiring the public to pay and insure the
driver) is that he has weak feet. Fitzpatrick
notoriously has a Aveak stomach. Do the tax-
payers pay his cook?
“’TIS HARD TO GIVE THE HAND WHERE THE HEART CAN NEVER BE.”
“For the first time since 1914 Australia is to have a German Consul. A German Consulate-General
will be opened in Melbourne next month. Directions have been issued for provisional recognition."
About the most significant thing in pro-
gress in the IJ.S.A. at present is the Back-
to-the-Towns campaign. The movement has
the support of many big organisations. The
monthly circular of the National Bank of
New York argues in favor of it this way:—-
Under tlie high prices ruling- in war-time ag.'i-
culture was stimulated to a scale of production
which now overloads the markets, and the remedy
for this is a movement from farms to the town
industries. Xfatural tendencies will restore the equi-
librium if allowed to do so ; meantime there are
advocates who are working to keep everybody on the
farms and to continue the production of certain
farm products on a scale that is undesirable.
Heaven knows what these critics would
think of the George Fullers and the like
who would borrow millions to put doubtful
farmers on more than doubtful farms at a
cost of three or four thousand apiece.
The N.S.W. drama of the Ballot-box with
the Sliding Panel unfolded another act last
week. The situation now seems to be:
(1) The A.L.P. says that Mr. Bailey took
delivery of the sliding boxes at his office on
a certain date, and had the slides fully ex-
plained to him: (2) Mr. Bailey says that
for some time before and after the alleged
event he wasn't in Sydney at all, and pro-
duced sworn affidavits in evidence; (3) the
A.L.P. says that the affidavits aren’t true,
as the minutes of that body show that Mr.
Bailey attended meetings at Macdonell
House during his alleged absence; (4) Mr.
Bailey says the minutes are malicious con-
, coctions of a later date. At latest advices
the matter rested there. But a large sec-
tion of the voting population is wondering
how many more cogs there are in the party
machine. So far, besides sliding panels, the
list includes lying, perjury, forgery, falsifi-
cation of entries and about six varieties of
corruption.
One of the best things the Vie. police
service could do would be to lose its measur-
ing-tape. It seems to have an idea that no-
thing can be done in the department except
by a large, meaty person. For more than
half the work of the service brawn is no
more wanted than it is in any other service;
and if, generally speaking, the senior men
are really of small mental capacity, it is
because brains are not taken to begin with,
unless they happen to be made up in a large
parcel of meat. Occasionally the force may
get intelligence; but it certainly misses far
more than it gets. Then later on the com-
munity wonders why most of its crimes go
undetected.
No Redistribution of Seats Bill is to be
passed during the present session of Vic.
Parliament. The most that the Coalition
would promise Labor when it raised the ques-
tion was that electorates would be recast
before Parliament turned up its toes. It
can't live more than 10 months at the most,
and few think that it will last that long, re-
distribution or no redistribution. One reform
with which Lawson will push on is the Elec-
toral Bill providing for a joint Federal and
State roll, compulsory enrolment, and the
discouragement of chevaliers d’industrie who
rig the postal vote.
Monasli, visiting Sydney for the first time
since the war, was welcomed by the A.W .U.
organ with the suggestion that his name
was “derived from the Yiddish word mon-
ish/’ And Lambert, alderman and
A.W.U. boss, refused to sign a municipal
address to the A.I.F. commander on the
ground that he couldn’t reconcile Ins
principles with those of General Monash.
What a crime it is in the eyes of these
squealing rabbits of pacifists to have fought
for Australia!
If Australia hasn’t quite forgotten its de-
votions it should set aside a day between
now and the British elections, and pray
with much liorse-power that Labor may not
win. For Ramsay Macdonald and co.. with
their “levy on capital,” propose to make an
unholy breakage of the class that lends this
country money, and there is no other class
to replace it.
On the eternal w T ant of pence:—
Sydney A.L.P. executive’s .worst worry is the des-
perate condition of its cash-box. The position was
bad when .T. M. Power was appointed to rattle the
implement,, but with an early election likely it ha?
become really horrible. The old dodge was tried
of demanding contributions from Labor M’s.L.A.,
but the politicians panned out only a few dwt. The
rank and file, who used to willingly dip into their
pockets when the financial SOS was given, iave o»
their enthusiasm, and the sources from which my>
terious money has been poured in the recen pa*
show signs of drying up. In the old days, wei
Labor was honest, its controlling body seldom had
much currency, but managed to live upon what n
got. To-day, having grown used to spending money
like water, it doesn’t know what to do when there
is only a trickle to spend.
From the Victorian Gallery :
Prendergast, the State Labor leader, takes his job
too seriously. He persists in speaking on every
subject that comes up for discussion, whether it is
mussels on the pier at Apollo Bay, width of tyres,
St. John’s wort, or trout in the Meander Greek-
The worst of it is he is a sick man. Obliged
recently to take to his bed, he persisted in sitting
up reading dryasdust papers and dragging informa-
tion from the Opposition secretary on all manner of
small beer. And —the truth must out —Parliament is
tired of Prendy. It always gets tired of old boys
who regard themselves with excessive reverence.
“0.K.”: At an Armistice Day service the
Archbishop of Canterbury, preaching on the
war, declared there was “danger in sheer
pessimism” as regards what we fought tor
and what we have not yet obtained. But
will ruthless bloodshed ever be averted save
by pessimism and cynicism? There can be
no stronger argument against another world-
war than rigid denial of the possibility ot
any real good ever coming of the last one.
When the great bulk of disciplined mankind
is pessimistic in its views of what carnage
has brought and can bring, Providence will
side with it against the smaller, noisier
forces of optimism, and the demand for peace
between the nations will*have a chance of
winning.
Tom Skeyliill, from Chicago :• —
Calvin Coolidge, President Harding’s successor, be-
ing a genuine New Englander, is a Conservative;
and if the Conservatives succeed in ushering in an
era of prosperity they will be “sitting pretty, and
will be able to nominate and perhaps elect Coolidge.
But if they fail to better business conditions they
will lose out, and will have to give way to the more
progressive elements of the Republican party, who
will nominate either Johnson or Pinchot or one o!
the other Progressives. In any event, Harding’s .
death has weakened the Presidential prospects of the
Republican party, and no matter whom it may nomi-
nate, be he Conservative or Progressive, the Demo-
cratic nominee, especially if it is McAdoo, fo-d
or Underwood, will put up a great fight for the next
Presidency of the U.S.A. The Party Conventions
will be held next April or May. At these conven-
tions the two great parties, the Republicans and the
Democrats, will nominate their respective candi-
dates. The elections take place the following
November.
What cant these politicians do talk! Tjn-
veiling a memorial to N.S.W. ex-Premier
McGowen, Hughes discoursed eloquently
about how his friend “led Labor when Labor
was an Ishmaelite and the hand of every man
against it,” and spoke of “we who labored
in the vineyard with him when the prospects
were dark and the persecutions as the sands
on the shore.” It sounded as if the poor
beggars (including Hughes) made great sac-
rifices for the cause, and wandered around in
goatskins, with the martyr’s crown as their
only other garment. As a matter of fact,
they collected their salaries punctually, and
some of them found politics a road to for-
tune —the only one they were likely to find.
There were martyrs, of course, and men who
made great sacrifices. But you didn’t find
them in Parliament; or, if you did, you
didn’t find them in two Parliaments.
“D.” : Near one of the Government depart-
ments in Sydney the other morning I
observed a big motor-patrol van. While
idly speculating as to whether the Ministry
hail at last decided on a wholesale arrest
of public servants for wasting the public s
time, an individual who might have been a
policeman in mufti left bis place by the
driver, and, bearing a small paint-pot in one
band and a brush in the other, approached
a “silent cop.” He . gave the little mound a
coat of yellow paint, rejoined the car and
was driven to another “silent cop,” a few
hundred yards away, which he proceeded to
treat similarly. The artist might have done
his rounds in a Ford, or a side-car: he might
even—since the radius within which these
traffic guides are to be found is limited-
have walked. That he preferred to employ
a caravan was symbolic. Multipiv this kind
of tiling by a million or so and the explana-
tion is provided of why N. S. Wales Govern-
ments are always more or less broke and
the taxpayers in a chronic state of blas-
phemy.
A monument has just been raised to Jim
McGowen, first Labor Premier of N. S.
Wall's ; and The Bulletin would gladly join
in the glowing eulogy if it could forget one
thing. McGowen promised to reduce bor-
rowing (then less than £2,000,000 p.a.) and
apply a sinking fund for all debts. In-
stead. he engaged in a shamelessly extrava-
gant loan policy, thus laying the foundation-
stone of the political corruption which im-
perils the solvency of the State. He had
his opportunity; but when his less straight-
laced colleagues found that there was an
easier way of getting votes and keeping in
power than by honestly sticking to the Labo-
policy, he went with them.
THE HARVEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dreams, not deeds, are the pulse of time.
Something we garner of field and hive,
Something- we labor in bricks and lime
That the eyes may gaze and the heart may thrive;
But ’neath moon and sun all deeds are done
Only to keep the dream alive.
Low in the dust the ages lie.
The high lights fail from the gilded dome;
Broken ages have heard the cry
“Where is Babylon? Where is Rome?”
All that they wrought and loved and taught
Lives in a dream ’neath the lamps of home.
Widen the streets that the cars may run
With a swifter whisper from place to place,
That the hammered steel and the soft web spun
May lend to life an hour of grace !
When the wheels are dead and the years are sped
There shall be dreams in the morning’s face.
Dreams, not deeds, are the pulse of time.
This let me gather while hot thoughts strive:
A glory of words and a wreath of rhyme
Where the soul of the deeds that failed may thrive.
Only for these have the lands and seas
Cried through the stricken eternities —-
To keep man’s dream alive !

Owing to lowered values and restricted trad-
ing, and probably .also because the manage-
ment selected risks with particular care, the
gross premium income for the last 12 months
was smaller than in the few preceding years.
The management was evidently better satis-
fied with the business written, because t.lie
lay-off in re-insurances was comparatively
smaller:—

underwriting conditions of the period the
United pulled through very successfully. The

The United is one of the very solid offices
which pays divs. wholly from its interest
earnings and puts every penny of underwrit-
ing profit and a bit more into reserve. For
the past 12 months £42,339 was laid aside
against £32,500 distributed. This happy
position has been made possible by the con-
servative policy of the directors in the co.’s
younger days. September 30 closed the 61st
year, but down to 10 years ago no more than
12 \ p.c. on original cash-paid capital was
distributed. In 1912 paid capital was
£85,402, and no less than £189.810 of re-
serves had accumulated. Capital was then
called up to a round £lOO,OOO, and since
then shareholders have been asked to put in
only £25,000 more, 5000 shares paid to £5
having been offered at par in 1919. But
during the past 11 years they have been
handsomely rewarded for having permitted
so much profit to accumulate in earlier
years. Eight entries in the introductory
table show that £225,000 of bonus scrip has
been issued, and the co. has done so magni-
ficently in that period that it has added
almost £190,000 to visible reserves. Every
bonus issue except the first lias been pro-
vided entirely from current surplus profits.
The latest gift issue takes paid capital to
£350,000. and 10 p.c. divs. on that give a
28 p.c. return on capital originally invested
*n the business.
Besides having developed into a gold-mine
for its shareholders, the United is a sound
.proposition for policy-holders. Total funds
now amount to £729,323. On the basis that
funds li times greater than premium income
give policy-holders fair protection, less than
£400,000 would have been adequate at
September 30. Apart from £350,000 which
can be called up from shareholders, the
1 nited shows assets sufficient to cover
losses 7f times those experienced last year.
The assets are a particularly fine lot: ‘they
include £580,000-odd of public securities,
deposits, cash and debentures; premises
written down to £104,281; mortgages,
£56,370; and healthy odds and ends. Allow-
ing 40 p.c. of last year’s net premium in-
come as cover for unexpired risks, each of
the. 70,000 £lO shares paid to £5 on the
register when the new issue is made on
November 30 will have the backing of assets
with a book value of £8 18s.

months the book value
of properties in possession” declined £847!)
to £36,095, and a realisation reserve account
expanded £8336. That addition to reserves
was apparently not all profit on actual sales;
£(000 of it came from the writing-up of pre-
mises from £lB,OOO to £25,000. However, div.
distributions are quite independent of these
happenings : the profits from current mort-
gage transactions, plus rents from premises
and other properties, easily provide the 10 p.c.
l|lTS ' The sale of foreclosed properties and
profits therefrom give new funds for build-
ing-society business, which should help future
earnings and strengthen the security for capi-
tal. The co. was caught badly' 30 years
ago and could not pay its creditors the
£330,000 it owed them. Assets were
therefore, revalued, and £7 per £lO share
written off. Until 15 years ago the
management was occupied in satisfying
its creditors ; but a re-arrangement then made
with them provided for the repayment, of all
<dd debt within 20 years. That enabled the
<•<>. to make a fresh start in mortgage busi-
ness, and also permitted the management to
resume the payment of efivs. to shareholders
if it could earn them. In 1908 the book
value of old foreclosures and mortgages was
£125,879, and the co. owed £69,608 to old credi-
tors. A more active market, following upon
State construction booms financed by heavy
borrowings gave St. Joe’s excellent oppor-
tunities to unload at appreciated values
and A du! so well that by 1917 all the capi-
tal believed to have been lost had been re-
placed, and by 1920 the div. rate had recov-
ered to 10 p.c. After 15 rears the old debts
have been reduced to £12.5 : 53. and the book
value of foreclosures to £36,095. Mean-
while £16,862 of new deposits have been put
to work, and a mortgage business running
into £llO.OOO lias been developed.
Here. are further comparisons of move-
ments since the 1908 re-arrangement:—

The old troubles have practically disappeared,
though the position would be much clearer
if the directors liad a little to say as to wliat
comprises the £36,095 of foreclosures still
on the books. The future of the society
depends mainly on the margins which were
allowed when making the newer advances
In recent abnormal years property values
appreciated more rapidly than circumstances
warranted, and it is not certain that values
which were obviously inflated by war condi-
tions will continue. Farming, dairying and
grazing property values have suffered a re-
action throughout the Commonwealth and
Maoriland since the war prosperity collapsed,
and only the greater crowding of the already
congested capital cities has maintained prop-
erty prices there while practically all other
commodities have declined in value. Rapid
industrial expansion has had much to do with
maintaining these values, and on the pros-
perity of the newer enterprises depends
the continuance of higher values in
the face of heavy Federal, State and
municipal taxes. However, the latest
boom has been free of much of the
recklessness of others ; St. .Joe’s, for instance,
is employing less than £30,000 of borrowed
money, and at September 30 had £26,649
covered by cash and War Loans. So if
values do unexpectedly collapse—there never
yet was a property boom which gave notice of
its intention to fizzle —the society is in a
sound position to nurse its securities, and if
the management has carefully selected its
clients in the recent rush on the building
societies, and valuations have been conserva-
tive, the society's position may be sounder
than the not very communicative balance-
sheet figures indicate.

The phenomenal profits of 1922 were made
partly by continuing to sell at the war-time
price of l id. per copy, though paper costs had
fallen ; and low valuations placed on paper
stocks in previous years may have also helped.
After making full provision for depreciation,
the directors decided to distribute £32,500 (13
p.c. ) to ordinaries and had £116,949 of the
year’s profit left for reserves. That put the
eo. in splendid condition to meet the invasion
of the Sun Newspapers, of Sydney, and to
face the expenditure on re-establishing the
business in new premises. The latest
accounts do not disclose how costly the
move proved, but a special reserve of £37,000
has disappeared, and so also lias an unspeci-
fied amount of profit made on sales of pro-
perty and discarded plant. Of the Sun
venture, the directors report that the new
evening paper "temporarily affected circula-
tion,” but “the small loss has been practi-
cally regained, and our circulation now
stands at approximately the high figure
reached before the opposition paper started.”
Meanwhile the Weekly Times, Pals,
Sporting Globe and Australian Home
Builder "have each shown substantial in-
creases.”
After having charged most, if not all, ex-
penditure incurred in removing and re-
assembling plant against reserves, and after
making unusually large allowances for depre-
ciation, the co. showed a net profit of
£74,095 for the past 12 months. The direc-
tors lifted the ordinary div. rate 7 points to
20 p.c., and even then £16,595 of surplus
profit—equal to another 6.6 p.c. on ordinary
capital—Was left for reserves. It is less
than eight years since paid capital was
doubled by a bonus issue, so on original capi-
tal last year’s distribution returned 40 p.c.
The figures are the more remarkable because
when the co. began no less than £198,000 of
the £250,000 of paid capital was issued for
goodwill. Profits have been so good that
after paying handsome divs. surpluses have
replaced the whole of the goodwill by tan-
gible assets. The following comparisons de-
tail movements over eight years ;

At September 30 the surplus of stocks, book
debts and other liquid assets over and above
all liabilities covered all except £42,965 of
the £125,000 of 6 p.c. cum. prefs. That
balance of pref. capital and the quarter-mil-
lion of ordinaries had the backing of free-
holds, machinery and plant with a written-
down book value of £371,357. The value of
printing plant as security, however, depends
on how much it would fetch if the Herald
and associated papers suddenly fizzled out,
and the figures are really only of value in
showing how the co.’s position has improved
since the time goodwill was the principal
asset. Book debts and liabilities were both
unusually heavy at the latest balance: the
former included £73,600 owing on “contracts
of sale” —no doubt in connection with the
sale of property and plant—and to finance
new premises and equipment the co. was
working on £68,696 overdraft and £43,500
of deposits. Though instalments on the pro-
perty and plant sales should reduce this in-
debtedness, the directors contemplate fur-
ther additions to printing plant, so outside
liabilities will probably continue large. In
these circumstances, they appear to have
made the pace a little too hot with the large
increase of div. distributions.

This co. was formed in 1922 when the Lin-
coln Spinning Mills Prop., Ltd., and the
Lincoln Knitting Mills Prop., Ltd., decided
to introduce additional capital into their
businesses to relieve them of the large float-
ing debts which had accumulated while the
enterprises were being established and de-
veloped. The amalgamated balance-sheets
ofthetwo cos. at December 31, 1921, showed
L 572,637 of tangible assets, including
jt01,254 in properties and buildings and
£346,336 in plant and machinery. To carry
stocks and . customers’ accounts the follow-
ing liabilities had accumulated: Bank over-
draft, £187,287 ; trade debts, £108,288 ; Gibbs,
Bright and Co. advance, £103.704; W.
Gaunt advance, £122,022; sundry creditors,
£8704. Including £20,000 provision for
taxation, liabilities totted up £550,005. Lin-
coln Mills (Australia), Ltd., was inaugu-
rated as a holding co. to take over
the scrip of the spinning and knit-
ting concerns—it issued 402,632 fully-
paid £1 ordinaries for the two busi-
nesses. including £BO,OOO for goodwill—and
offered £400,000 of 9 p.c. cum. prefs. to the
public. This issue was fully subscribed.

co. started w T as the cost of flotation, etc.
The new industry has suffered a severe set-
back: the cheap labor products of continental
Europe, finished in England, have been
dumped in tremendous volume into the Com-
monwealth as English manufactures, at
prices which have been little more than local
production costs. These troubles, which
have been due to some extent to the
depreciated currencies of the cheap-labor
countries, are probably only temporary; but
it is noteworthy that at the first serious on-
slaught on Australian industry the mueh-
talked-of anti-dumping legislation of the Com-
monwealth has failed entirely to relieve tin l
position, the Tariff Board having turned a
deaf ear to appeals by the spinners.
Gold's Hosiery Mills, of Sydney, has
passed into the control of debenture-holders
because it depended over-much on bor-
rowed funds. The Lincoln people, having
replaced floating debt by pref. capital, are
free of all such troubles; they merely express
regrets at their inability to pay divs. Pref.
di vs. were £36,1)00 in arrears'at June 30.
but unless creditors are also large, nothing
more serious than the accumulation of
arrears of divs. confront the directors on the
financial side. The precise position of the
enterprise, however, is not ascertainable, be-
cause the accounts of the holding co. do not
disclose how the subsidiaries fared. The
parent concern depends wholly on divs. from
the spinning and knitting enterprises for its
income, and the £l3BO loss for the year was
not the result of manufacturing and trad-
ing, but the total of the holding eo.’s ex-
penses: salaries and directors’ fees. £1240;
general exes., £137 ; office-furniture deprecia-
tion. £0 ; less £3 which slipped out of the
preliminary expenses account. However,
there is a reassuring statement in the direc-
tors' report: they “regret that the profit
earned by the subsidiary cos. has not been
sufficient to permit the payment of a div.”
Evidently, the holding co., while itself show-
ing a loss, is really interested in some profit
made by the subsidiaries after they had
made “full’’ provision for depreciation. Be-
yond that, very little can be learned of the
actual position, though there should not be
much doubt that the prefs. are well secured.
On the figures presented 18 months ago there
were £722,000 or so of tangible assets as
security for £400,000 of prefs., and the larger
portion of the pref. issue is, no doubt, covered
by stocks —they are reported to have
been well written down—book debts,
etc., and the balance is well secured
by properties. The directors are con-
fident that the business will soon be
restored to a more profitable basis, and as
the factories are efficiently equipped and are
controlled by men with wide experience of
the trade, Lincoln Mills seems in a good posi-
tion to make the most of a recovery. The
public’s interest is restricted to the prefs.

undergoing considerable alteration,
holders having agreed to the purchase of the
British mine, the share-register is to be in-
creased from £600,000 to £700,(X)0 and the
co. is committed to paying £140,6-5 cash
to British holders, excepting the South Co.
and the Zinc Corp,, whose total holdings ot
100,000 shares the North has the right to
purchase for £105,000. No doubt the option
on these shares will be exercised, so £245,b20
of cash will pass in the deal. The directors
won’t have any difficulty m finding the
money, because at June 30 last the liquid
position was as follows: —

„ £632,464
Liabilities do not include £106,100 of debefl*
tures. Since the balancing date another
£60,000 lias been distributed to shareholders,
but everything has continued to gO SO Well
for the co. that cash assets have been steadily
piling up. Incidentally, the June statement
of liquid assets did not take into account the
following holdings in other cos.:—
B. H. A. Smelters .. .. •• ..£200,000
Electrolytic Zinc 150,000
British-Australian Lead Manufacturers .. 20,000
Barrier Roaster Co. .. . . • • • • 10,000
Minor interests . . . . • • • • 6,020
£386,025
Even after the liquidator of the British has
been settled with, the North will still show
a big liquid surplus. The extent of liquid
assets to be transferred by flic purchased co.
is not ascertainable.
From a mining point of view, the acquisi-
tion of the British gives the North approxi-
mately a million tons more ore to treat, and
with its efficient plant that material will be
worth more than it would have been in the
hands of the British. Above 1400 ft. in the
North mine ore reserves are conservatively
estimated at 21 million tons. Development
work is proceeding on the new 1550 ft. level,
and on present appearances there are bright
prospects of opening up 11 million tons more
to the level above. Altogether, there should
be not less than five million tons available
tot treatment, assuring at least 17 _ years
work, even if general-manager Geo. Weir in-
creases output to the pre-war average of
6000 tons per week with production from
the British stopes. The co.’s future, how-
ever, depends on circumstances which its
hard-headed Board cannot control: the ex-
tent of profits is contingent entirely on the
state of the world’s metal markets, and that
factor alone can decide whether the purchase
of the British at the price paid was wise.
W r ith lead up to £3O, and zinc also high
in an assured market, both the North and
South cos. are having a great run again,
despite the Edmunds labor award. The
North’s srross mine profit for the 12 months
ended June was £597,215, and came from
treating 171,555 tons ore, which gave 35,19 s
tons lead concentrates (64.1 p.c. lead;
30.30 z. silver and 7.9 zinc) and 32,054 tons
zinc concentrates (49 p.c. zinc; Boz. silver
and 6.8 p.c. lead). The marketing of the
production of previous years gave £48,190
over and above the original credits, and in-
terest and divs. from investments turned in
£28,117 for the vear. The accounts showed
a net profit of *£284,780, but in the intro-
ductory table additions to reserves have been
included —£20,000 was set aside for deprecia-
tion and £26,100 was added to an eoualisa-
tion reserve; on the other hand, £-5,900
dropped out of the debenture sinking-fund
reserve. „ .

A year ago B. 11. Block 14, on the strength
of a hot metal market, ran into debt to the
Associated Smelters. Lead has again
touched £3O, and the co., having no mill, has
been looking round for another friend. It
found it in the old home; the parent 1 ro-
prietarv Co. has agreed to handle the balance
of the ore in the mine, amounting to about
275,000 tons. This will mean a reduction
of overhead charges to the Prop., and the
running of the mill on a class of material
that will blend with that of the big con-
cern. In addition. Block 14, being along-
side the Prop., can have its ore handled
under the best conditions. It is something
gained to have restored old relations that
went awry when Adelaide took the control
of Block i 4 from the original B.H.P. crowd.
The co. went £8669 to the had last half-
year.
Six months ago Jones’s Mining Conces-
sions (W.A.) received from Adelaide an
offer of £20,000 and a 15 p.c. fully-paid in-
terest for its holdings of 2000 acres. It re-
jected the offer with scorn and commenced
development on its own account. Several
small but rich gold-bearing veins have since
been exposed in shallow ground,, but the co.
is short of cash and finding it hard to carry
on. The State Government voted £lBOO for
the equipment and keep of the prospecting
narty which discovered the “concessions,”
and before long it will probably be asked
for further financial assistance.
A model of the famous Brownhill-Oroya
telluride shoot will be exhibited in the West-
ralian display at the Empire Exhibition.
The exhibit will be ticketed with the infor-
mation that the shoot furnished 1,325,000
tons of ore for treatment, and yielded nearly
seven million pounds’ worth of gold. This
wealth was obtained from seven mines which
the bonanza traversed. The shoot was first
discovered outcropping at the north end of
the Browiihill lease. From there it pitched
at a fiat angle southwards, and after succes-
sively passing through the Brownhill, Brown-
hill Extended, Cygnet, Associated Northern
and Oroya North, died out in the Asso-
ciated lease. Its total length was 030 ft.,
average width 150 ft., and its average height
70ft. Up to within a short distance of the
Associated boundary the average value per
foot of the shoot was nearly £l5OO.
* * * *
The English-owned .Paringa co., after
years of unprofitable prospecting in foreign
lands, has again settled in the West.
Besides testing the Hazel mine on the
Broad Arrow field, which is held under
option to purchase, it proposes to resume
operations on its oid show adjoining the
Oroya Links, at Kalgoorlie. Tnbutors have
won a lot of gold from it, and the co. intends
to look for the continuation of the lodes. A
crosscut is being put in to intersect any
formations which exist between the old
South shaft and the Oroya boundary. This
area from the surface down to 800 ft. has
hitherto not been explored. The co. recently
issued 330,000 shares at Is., giving £10,500
additional working capital.
* * * *
Mutooroo Co. has wearied of wandering
from place to place in search of a mine, and,
attracted by recent developments in the
Celebration, has returned to Hampton
Plains. Results from its holding there have
so far been indifferent. The shares for 3 r ears
have have been gambling counters ; the public
eagerly buys in on the first sign of a rising
market, and speedily absorbs without verifi-
cation any information broadcasted about
the co.’s prospects. Needless to say, the
public has again and again lost heavily.
According to N. E. Giblin. _ Golden Hope
(W.A.) is a mine of possibilities. It may
be, but the chances of shareholders ever.get-
ting their money back do not look bright.
The mine should have been developed to. a
much greater extent before a mill was in-
stalled. If that had been done Giblin would
not have had to report that the mill was
ahead of the mine, and that lack of develop-
ment was hampering operations.
* * * *
The Lloyd George (W.A.) is right off the
gold in the south end. and has commenced
an expensive search for the lost treasure.
This explains the consistent selling at any
old price by Westralian shareholders.
High values are reported from the old
Lord Roberts mine, near Southern Cross
(W.A.). This show has been worked by
prospectors and mining syndicates for years,
and if anything of value is left the age of
miracles is not past. The Lord Roberts ore-
shoots are a continuation of those in the
Transvaal mine, from which Victor Lesgo
and Co. extracted arsenic for a time. The
Transvaal can be commended to anyone
seeking a rough passage in ore-treatment.
* * * *
Derelict C.S.A., Cobar (N.S.W.), is out
with accounts showing a loss of £1764 for
the year ended June 30. Against £l7O in
receipts, directors’ fees mopped up £500;
office expenses, £341 ; mine working account,
£571; insurance, £236; and interest, £l2O.
The directors also required £5O for travel-
ling exes. Profit and Loss is now £19,850
to the bad. The book value of leases, plant,
shafts, buildings, etc., at Cobar and Ivandos
is £136,158.
* * * *
Big Ben Development Syndicate. Gun-
dagai (N.S.W.), after staving off a bailiff,
has let the show on tribute, manager Lowes
agreeing to lead the tributors. The threat
to clean up 200 tons at the battery does
not appear to have materialised. One big
holder who bought 75 shares at £lO and paid
calls of 10s. a share for 12 months, in addi-
tion to guaranteeing a bank overdraft of
some £2OOO, must feel highly elated at these
latest developments.
* * * *
Cecil Ryan's sluice-gauge at the Pioneer,
Bradshaw’s Creek (Tas.), shows that
11,385,000 cub. yd. of wash have given 78984
tons of tin oxide, an average of 1.5541 b. a
vd.. with costs working out at 6.257 d. The
Argonaut’s contribution has been 440.00()vd.
for 303 tons oxide, with costs at 8.838 d. The
difference in costs shows that bulk handling
tells all the time. Last year’s work was
confined to seven months owing to dry con-
ditions. Nevertheless, 381,800 yd. went
down the Pioneer’s boxes. Costs in the deep
ground are as high as 9.145 d. owing to
cemented wash at the bottom of the lead
requiring explosives and hand-picking, both
costly. Ryan had doubts whether the lead
would carry pay-dirt ahead. Now he has
butted into a granite bar; the old river
having been thus split, its current seems to
have scoured out the tin in half of the
gutter. How far the other section will con-
tinue to be payable the nozzle will decide,
but a good run is assured for nine months.
Even with all his mine troubles and a low
market for tin during portion of the period
Ryan screwed £17,311 out of the mine for
distribution in Queen-street.
Standard Molybdenite, Everton (Vic.), is
getting off the rocks. With another six
months of present improved markets for the
metal it expects to rid itself of the last of
its debt of £6900 to E. (1. Moss. The fight
has been hard, even with high-grade stuff
available and easy working conditions. Since
July, 1922, development has exposed 4000
tons of high-grade material. The Standard
needs less boost and more cash; it could have
had the latter when the boom was on, but
refused it, and has been shaky ever since
the war-market crashed.
New Langi Logan is to lose Bill Toole. It
is almost a record to have put £200,000 into
a mine and never seen the color of a div.
But not quite; for mining-engineer Hoover
saw the best part of a million go into Moor-
lort, and also a fair-sized wad sunk in the
Cathcart without even getting on to gold.
In the Langi lead Toole had the handicap of
costly supplies, higher wages, low labor effi-
ciency and heavy water; and even then he
could beat everything save patchy wash. The
talk is that Geo. Bryant is to succeed him.
That gets the market with its thinking cap
on, for Bryant’s luck and management have
proved worth ss. a share to most shows.

There is every probability of a revision
of Minister Jones’s ukase that only 10-acre
leases are to be granted on the Mt. Isa
field. Nobody is satisfied with the decision,
and it is likely that in the next few weeks
further counsels may lead to an increase in
the leasehold areas being permitted. Mean-
while there is a steady influx to the field, and
new discoveries around the main area are
more than a possibility.

The production of concentrates at Mt.
Cobalt. Cloncurry (Q.), has been seriously
retarded for mouths past by the exception-
ally severe drought. The mine itself is
looking well down to 150 ft., and operations
will be pushed on when sufficient water is
available for the mill. The co. is putting
in a compressor to run 10 machine drills.
Prices for the metal are still poor. The
Canadian output is substantial, and now the
Belgian Congo is producing high-grade
cobalt from the Katanga mines.
* * * *
After a long period of prospecting the
Billy Hughes Co. has settled down to work
the Bruce and Resurgam mines, Normanby
field (N.Q.). On the Bruce a shaft is
down to 15ft. in a diorite formation on a
lode averaging 22in. wide with values rang-
ing from 15dwt. to loz. The mainshaft in
the Resurgam is down 30ft., and both the
size of reef and values are reported to have
improved in the last 10ft. of sinking. The
reef in the bottom is 18in. wide, and assays
up to 3oz. have shown up. A little pros-
pecting is being done on a vein a few inches
thick, between the two mainshafts, known
as the Spider, where values go as high as
40z., but the reef is small. Crushing has
started with 50 tons of ore at grass, and it
is anticipated 100 tons will be put through
before Christmas.
* * * *
The position at Blair Athol (Q.) coal-
field is very depressing; the mines are aver-
aging only three to four shifts a week, while
the total output is only around 4000 tons
per month, a quarter of what it was a few
years back. Work has stopped at the big
open-cut at a depth of about 50ft., and the
co., after spending more than £lO,OOO ou
the job, finds that it has still about 20ft.
to go to the seam. Presumably more capital
will have to be raked in, but capital cost
cannot be on too lavish a scale if divs. arc
ultimately to be paid, as there is the item
of about' 300 miles freightage to the coast
to be considered. Meanwhile J. W. Hether-
ington is abroad attempting to collect orders.
Newcastle. Ltd., has not disclosed its hand,
although it cannot be doing well. There
should be a way out with a seam 50ft. to
90ft. thick of good coal.
A check on Walter Colley’s sampling of
the Russell River dredging area (N.Q.) has
been made by Walter Baker, late manager
of the Perseverance Dredging Co. (Yic.), and
of the Manuka Dredging Co. (M.L.). He
reports that the wash averages 6oz. tin and
2dwt. gold to the cubic yard for a depth
of I Sin. Baker recommends further box-ing
of the alluvial flats.
The big lode in the crosscut at Tyrconuell,
Kingsborough (N.Q.), is patchy, but it is
expected to bulk sufficiently well to pay its
way. A slight improvement in values would
put this battling concern on a sound footing
again, but the pi’oblem facing shareholders
is what is to be done when all the contri-
buting capital is called up.
Oaks Consolidated has commenced work on
the Mt. Buchanan-Palmer goldfield (Q.),
and is sinking shafts to 50ft. to ascertain
values at depth.
* * * *
Some good, colorless mica in commercial
sizes has been unearthed lately on the Mt.
Isa field (Q.). It occurs in a large pegma-
tite lode, and as several shallow shafts have
exposed encouraging supplies, the deposit
has a chance.

“B.V.E.’': Truth is stranger than fiction
sometimes, even the fiction of Greek tra-
gedies. He met her at a dance in Brisbane.
They seemed mutually attracted, and spent a
good deal of the evening in each other’s com-
pany. Afterwards he escorted her home, and
made an appointment to meet her on the
following evening. The acquaintance soon
ripened into something more tender, and
within a few weeks, after a regretful allu-
sion to the disparity in their ages (he was
39 and she 19), he declared liis love, and
asked her to marry him. She laughed at
the idea of his age making any difference,
accepted him, and invited him to come and
see dad. He did so. and found himself being
introduced to his own brother, who _ had
cleared out from Perth with his (the suitors
wife) and infant child 18 years before.
The mother had since died. The girl was his

“Wink": Melbourne’s record riot before
that of the other evening—which made it
look a tame affair —was when the peace of a
July Sabbath in 189(5 was fractured. The
brethren of the Brunswick Orange Lodge
had announced that they would march in full
regalia to the local Wesleyan chapel to cele-
brate the anniversary of the Battle of the
Boyne. Immediately afterwards an adver-
tisement invited all loyal Irishmen to meet
on the same day and “discuss the Irish Ques-
tion” on an allotment near the Sarah Sands
Hotel, which the procession would pass. The
public turned up to the number of 20,0H0.
and the play began when a buggy containing
four higlily-decorated Orangemen was stop-
ped in front of the Irish meeting. After a
few pointed remarks on both sides, shil-
lelaghs and their Sassenach equivalent began
to crack; then, as if at a signal, half a mile
of crowded Sydney-road was lighting to re-
tain its weapons. Long into the night the
war continued. One section refers to the
affair as “the Battle of the Sarah Sands” ;
another as “when Father Luby led the
rebels in 1890.” But this last is a libel,
for that priest pushed among the crowd and
did more than the police to restore order.
“Tauwamt” (Moresby) :
I should like to meet some
of the Port Moresby married
men who. according to
"Motutau" (B. 13/9/’23),
“rub along” on £2O a month
and less ; better still, I should
like to meet their wives. A
few years ago a Government
Glassification Board fixed the
living wage for a married
man at £4OO a year, and any
benedick who comes here at
a salary which, including all
allowances, does not tot up
to this figure is inviting
trouble. To an Austral-
Papuan, especially if he is
married, a 2000-mile sea trip
is not a luxury to be enjoyed
once or twice in a lifetime:
it is a heavy financial respon-
sibility to be shouldered
every two or three years. To
compare Moresby houses with
those of certain N.Q. towns
is to libel Queensland. There
are white men and their
families living here in shacks
at which a New Orleans
darky would turn up his
nose. The white worker in
Papua is at the mercy of his
employer all along the line.
There is no Employers’ Lia-

“Bostonian” : I wonder if it will be any
consolation for Lawson. Premier of Vic,, to
know that, it was a police strike which put
Calvin Coolidge on the way to become Presi-
dent of the United States'? Towards the end
of his-first term as Governor of Massachusetts
(lie was elected in 1918) three-fourths of the
Boston police deserted their posts, and the
city was given over to criminals. This is
how the Boston correspondent of the New
York Tribune described it :
Lawlessness, hoodlumism, thievery and every form
of crime ran riot. There was little or no restraint.
The few loyal members of the Department who re-
mained at their posts were powerless to restore even
a semblance of order. Edwin ( . Curtis was Police
Commissioner. He had forbidden the affiliation of
the policemen’s union with the American Federation
of Labor, and he was supported by Mayor Peters, a
Democrat who stood shoulder to shoulder with the
Governor in the crisis. The issue was never before
more definitely drawn between law and order on the
one side and lawlessness on the other. Perhaps Gov-
ernor Coolidge could not have won the battle without
the aid of Curtis and Peters. It is certain that the
city officials would have been unable to handle the
situation without his support. The issue was one
BREED WILL TELL.
“ He's a hunting dog."
“Go on! What can he hunt?"
“Only fleas, so far; hut wait till he grows up.”
which promised to make or break the political for-
tunes of Governor Coolidge. 'He was warned by some
friends that opposition to the policemen’s union would
end in his defeat in the approaching gubernatorial
election. His reply was characteristically brief and
to the point. He said: “It doesn’t matter' whether I
am Governor of Massachusetts again or not.!’
Resolutely Coolidge stuck to his guns, and the
nation applauded when he replied to Samuel
Gompers. President of the American Federa-
tion of Labor: “There is no right to strike
against the public safety, any time, any place
or in any way.” The strike fizzled out;
Coolidge ran for a second term as Governor,
and was returned with a record-breaking
plurality. From that moment he was what
we call “Presidential timber”; and when the
Republicans nominated him to run for the
Vice-Presidency, the consensus of opinion was
that it considerably strengthened the ticket.
Indeed, many thought that Coolidge and not
Harding should have headed the ticket. On
Harding’s death lie succeeded, of course, in
the ordinary way; and he may run for a
second term.
“Momokeui": It happened just after the
outbreak of war, when the native police were
being used as a
guard at the Port
Moresby (Papua)
wireless station. I
was going on shift
one evening, when
the officer on watch
challenged me tlius-
wise: “Halt! Who

fore T could reply

"Top Kail'': What Digger collected the
greatest number of wounds and is still
sound V I nominate a youngster from Ohin-
dora (North Coast. N.S.YV.). With one foot-
shattered by an egg bomb, he lay in a shell-
hole during the Mouquet Farm hopover, and
had 29 shrapnel pellets hurled into him. He
lay with liis back against the Fritz side of
the hole, his body being thus protected to
the hips. Below that point he was exposed,
and that part of him was perforated with
pellets, which came at intervals during the
several hours he lay in the cavity. He pulled
through three weeks of tetanus, and now
shows no effects of the ordeal but a slight
limp. He can sit on a buekjumper longer
than most men, and that’s a fair test of leg
power. When lie got the issue he was on
the right side of 17.
“Kip” lives another night in Rabaul:—
The crescent moon throws reflections on the rip-
pling waters of the harbor, cloaking the decrepitude
of the harbor craft and
the deformities of the
dismal skeleton of a
pier. Silhouetted
against the sky, slim
cocoanut-palms on the
western ridge lean
drunkenly. By the
water's edge a native
amuses himself with an
accordion; the melan-
choly effect of the low,
oft-repeated note <s
dispelled by the open-
ing strains of a fox-
trot from a blatant
gramophone. Beelining
in cane chairs flimsily-
clad women wag their
tongues tirelessly in
scandal; it is re-echoed
by sundry natives pad-
ding softly through the
deep pools of shadow
formed by avenues of
tall casuarina; they,
too, know—it’s com-
mon knowledge! Over
a green cloth a young
Administration clerk is
wondering whether
three kings are good
enough support for a
month’s salary. In the
club a sozzled planter
orders yet another
whisky-soda, and sighs
heavily for the next
Mataram. Behind a
bar in Chinatown a
dapper little man is
sorting out his chits,
pausing now and then
to wonder whether So-
and-so will pay
Wrapped in darkness
are the Administration
offices; ablaze with
kerosene lamps the
Chinese stores. Lights
twinkle from the Resi-
dence on lofty Nama-
nula standing, as t
were, aloof from this strange community of people*,

“0.K.” with murder in his soul: —
When Melbourne gets its long-delayed police re-
forms the suppression of unrnelodious itinerant
musicians will follow, I trust. Why permit the
nuisance who makes hideous noises for a living,
while gentle-spoken mendicants who pitch the old
tale of unabashed woe and ask frankly for the
price of a meal are arrested for law-breaking? To
street singers or instrumentalists with respectable
goods to offer I raise no objection. Even the para-
sites who sing duets to harmonium accompaniment
outside a pub may, in some eases, be excused on
account of their artistic leanings. But the average
able-bodied person who plays the cornet or the flute
at the Same corner, in the same street, at the same
time every week, is invariably a hopeless pretender.
THE LITTLE COMFORTER.
DAISY: “The Darlinghursts only asked me
to their evening because I can sing.”
MAISY: “Oh I’m sure it wasn't for that,
darling!”
How he can be content to go on for years without
attempting to do better is as inexplicable as the per-
mission granted him to continue his evil noises. The
impostor is strong enough to stand about in the
streets for hours in all kinds of weather, holding up
a cornet or what not, and discordantly announcing
himself as a beggar waiting for contributions. &■>
docs this by toleration of somebody—policeman or
Premier. If he were only half as sturdy and
merely voiced his own wants without blowing a
trumpet, he would be run-in for begging and
sentenced to 14 days.

ROAST VEAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I cook the Sunday’s dinner. Bubble! Bubble !
The spuds are boiling' and the cabbage too ;
The range is like a furnace. What of trouble?
We’ll juggle through the way we always do !
Roast veal for dinner; hear it spit and splutter,
Glad prelude to a symphony of food!
“He’ll spoil, it all!” I hear the missus mutter.
Well, what’s the odds; I’m in a cooking mood !
An artist, be lie so in words or dripping.
Must crown the moment’s impulse with the deed ;
My veal I see in gravied morsels slipping
Down youngling throats voracious in t? < ir need.
An alchemist am I, in exultation,
Transmuting slaughtered calf to childish glee;
Pot-bellied, when they’ve joyed in my collation,
They’ll leave the world to washing-up and ttie !
Meanwhile I mash the spuds with salt and butter,
I drain and chop the cabbage very small.
In bedroom exile let the missus mutter;
“When’s dinner, Dad?” I hear the children call.
A vision of the feast and its conclusion
Flits through my brain, with slippered hunger shed ;
Not mine to spoil a scolding' wife’s illusion —-
This day I dine with children and with God!
We haven’t any flour (Oh, damn the grocer!
He stopped my credit weeks and weeks ago ;
The noose of unpaid bills keeps drawing closer,
But yet we live. . . .and it was ever so!)
Some toasted bread to crumbs I deftly sinntter
And season them with garlic and a clove:
The plates—that they’re enamel doesn’t matter,
And chipped as well —I heat upon the stove.
DIDN'T CITE A MAX A CTIAXCE.
TTHE DOCTOR: “Yang that telephone-I was 100 late
again .”
HIS WIFE: “What, was the patient dead, darling?"
THE DOCTOR: “Dead? No, he'd got all righ t again.!"
Te gods! The opened oven-door releases
A savor that makes hunger whet his teeth
And shows the crackling, folded in brown creases,
Yet white as breast of chicken underneath.
All sizzling hot, I fork it to a platter,
The fragrant, juices gout arid splutter down
In savory ooze. . . .Good Heavens, docs it mnttei
The butcher’s still unpaid by half a crown?
I set it on the -oilcloth-covered table:
With cabbage and the spuds I do the same.
Hurrah! the gravy’s made as best I’m able:
And, anyhow, the kids will never blame.
“Quick! Dinner’s ready!” Shouts of eager voices,
A pattering tumult of tempestuous feet!
Slice after slice each happy child rejoices
AVith all it wants and more than it can eat!
Yes. life's a queer old puzzle, by your pardon.
That which was calf and later on was veal
Is now but children romping in the garden,
Happy because they’ve had a ding-dong meal.
Since so you think. I'll take it as you d said i-t,
In household economics I am odd.
I've lpdged that half-crown to the butcher’s credit
In Heaven—and dined with children and with God!

“Stormy”: “Quack” (B. 8/10/’23) men-
tions various strange places where the Aus-
tralian infant has started his or her career.
I have another to add to the list. A cer-
tain cruiser of the Imperial Navy, well famed
for the length of time she swung around the
buoy in Farm Cove, was open to visitors
on a Sunday afternoon. A lady visitor was
taken suddenly ill, and sought the seclusion
of one of the funnel-casings. Shortly after-
wards an excited seaman was informing the
officer of the watch that a child had been
born aboard H.M.S. Mantelpiece. The situation
might have been regarded as unprecedented,
but the officer nobly maintained the naval
tradition of being equal to any emergency.
“Tell the Master-at-Arms to,.victual it up
in the usual manner,” lie directed.

“Guinea Please”: Broomfield. K.C.. who
was so pained by some mildly critical re-
marks made by The Bulletin about Chief
Justice Cullen, was a contributor to the
symposium of Bar compliments which
greeted the elevation of Judge Cohen to the
District Court Bench. Among other things:
It was said that Mr. Cohen was an honorable
man. There were very many men ■out at Callao
Park who were honorable gentlemen, but that con-
stituted no reason why they should be appointed to
the judiciary of New South Wales. Outside that
alleged qualification, it appeared to him that Mr.
PAWS —NEVER PAUSE.
“Gam, what, d'you know about work? Yer
never do any.”
“Mine friendt, mine handth are never idle.”
Cohen bore no other. Still Mr. Cohen must know,
unless he was inflated beyond human belief with a
sense of his own capacity', that he was quite
for the position that had been offered to him, and
it was quite open to question that any man with
a high sense of honor would, under the circumstances,
accept the appointment.
Possibly the principle is that the interests
of the public are less likely to be prejudiced
by gentle criticism of a Judge who is near-
ing the end of his professional career than
they are by the furious discrediting of one
who has all his judicial life before him.
“Hamborie” : He
was a 14-year-old
pupil at a Sydney
secondary school,
and he collected
13s. 3d. from the
lower school to buy
a baton for presen-
tation to a master
who had organised
several concerts for
the boys. No pre-
sentation h a v i n g
come to light a
week later, one of
the masters made
inquiries which re-
sulted in the young-
ster confessing that
he had spent most
of the money. The
master suggested
that he should go
home and obtain
the amount from
his parents. “Can’t,
sir,” replied the
kid; “my people
are away up the
country and won’t
be back for a
week.” Then he
suddenly bright-
eiied. “But I can
borrow it. sir.”
“All right, borrow
it. Only get it, or
it will be the worse
for you,” warned
the master. The
kid returned in a few minutes with
the missing amount —7s. Gd. “There
you are, sir,” he remarked cheerfully. That
was the last the school saw of the youth.
The musical master received his baton, and
later was told of the youngster’s financial
crash and of the good but unknown friend
who had loaned the badly-needed 7s. Gd. A
look of blank amazement came over his
face. “I wondered,” lie gasped, “what he
wanted that 7s. Gd. for!”
“Magpie”: Laundresses mostly have a
fixed tariff, but I can recall one exception.
It was in Broome (W.A.). Being a bit run
down I decided to engage someone to come in
and do the washing, and sent for Mary.
Mary was a pure-bred Australian: but she
soon showed that she was gifted with a. fine
sense of discrimination. She arrived in a
pair of high-heeled boots and very little else.
After making arrangements for the day—
as to the “kai-kai” and the “chew-back” and
so on—Mary proceeded to name her terms.
“S’pose me washem clothes alonga boots,
then five tchillin’. S’pose me no wearem
boots, then free tchillin.” I engaged her
without the boots.
The plea of “Bloggs” :
It’s all very well for The Bulletin to
denounce sectarianism as un-Christian and un-
charitable, but where would either Christi-
anity or charity be without the thing ? Some
days ago, matters spiritual being a bit slack
on the business side, Father O’Reilly, of Syd-
ney, broke a silence which has worried none
more than the Orangemen, with a series of
rousing insults. The faithful subscribed
£lOOO on the spot. For several weeks to
come they are bound to be more devout :s
they- brood on the wrongs that the Educa-
tion system is doing them —with beneficial
results to the plate. Meanwhile Brother Ness
and his following have not been idle. Already
angry protests against the sentiments of
O’Reilly have been voiced, and the faithful
have been convinced that unless something is
done the Vatican may take charge. So for
several weeks many will go to chapel who
would otherwise have spent the Sabbath in
the surf or playing tennis, and much more
cash will be forthcoming than if the clerical
swashbuckler from Newtown had held his
tongue. Many an admirable institution, Pro-
testant and R.C., owes its origin and con-
tinued prosperity largely to the action and
reaction of such forces. What alternative
goad has The Bulletin in mind in the event
of this form of holy competition being abol-
ished as opposed to the teachings of the Re-
deemer ?
“O. McKay M.”: Re the drunk’s plea of
irresponsibility (B. 8/11/’23), the rule of
law is that intoxication is no excuse. But
there is a recognised exception which prac-
tically robs the rule of significance. To con-
stitute a crime there must be a “guilty mind”
as well as a wrongful act. In the case of
a drunken man killing another an acquittal
might follow if the prisoner were able to
prove that his mind was so affected by his
libations that he was incapable of realising
the nature of his act. “This vice doth de-
prive men of the use of reason, and puts
many into a perfect phrenzy,” is Hale’s
quaint way of stating the position. The
principle was established in Meade’s case
by the Court of King’s Bench in 1909,
though some doubt has since been thrown
upon its validity by the House of Lords.
MAKING THINGS SO DIFFICULT FOR MARY.
MISTREES. : “Mary, I thought I told you never to let me see that
man here again?”
M AID: “But how can I help it, mum? Yon do 'op round so!”
Still, the law only holds a man accountable
for the natural and probable consequences of
his acts as he should have foreseen them,
and a person “blind-drunk” may be shown
to be ‘ irresponsible in that regard.
“Hobnobster": In a country district of
N. S. Wales recently a youngster of not more
than 12 was charged at the local police-
court with arson, the subject matter of
the charge being the dwelling-house of a
local bread-carter. During the hearing of
the case the .P.M. asked the diminutive
accused if he knew what he was doing when
he set the place on fire. “Yes,”, came the
response. “Why did you do it?” “Well,"
said the youngster, “the baker was giving
my mother cheek, and I knew I couldn’t
fight him, so I burnt his house down.” As
an afterthought he added, “And I’d burn
your place down, too, if you gave my mother
cheek.” Now, altogether, three hearty Brit-
ish cheers for —the American “pitchers” !
“White Peak” : Almost anything offers an
excuse for a historical celebration these
times, but there is one sort of W.A. pioneer
who is on the eve of becoming extinct with
the minimum of publicity. This is the ex-
convict irom Great Britain. Thirty years
ago, even 20, he was to be found, often a
highly-respected resident, in most of the
older Groperland country towns. But
whether he had prospered or the reverse he
was generally gregarious, and a certain clan-
nishness among the survivors of the immi-
gration policy that helped to people W.A. in
the ’fifties and ’sixties kept the “old hand,”
as he w r as euphemistically called, a little
apart from the rest of the community. There
are very few of them now. Convict trans-
portation to Fremantle ceased in 1888, 55
years ago, and few offenders were sent over-
seas under the age of 20. The handful who
remain must be well over the allotted span.
But nobody is ever likely to know r when the
last patriot (in the Barringtonian sense)
passes over. There is no real reason why
even officialdom should know, and there are
many why, if it does, it should keep its
mouth shut.
* * * *
“Herodot”: The Queensland suicide who
shuffled off this mortal coil by diving head-
first into a locomotive’s firebox has had pre-
decessors in the search for an out-of-the-way
end. An employee at a Melbourne chemical
works jumped into a large vat of concen-
trated sulphuric acid and was literally de-
hydrated, the acid removing every drop of
moisture from his body. Another experi-
mentalist threw himself into the midst of
some machinery and was torn to fragments
before it could be stopped. In South Aus.
a would-be suicide, who had doubts about
his own pluck, stole a pair of handcuffs from
a police-station, and attached himself by
means of them to the railway-line just before
a fast express was due. Then he threw away
the key. His luck was out, however, for
the train was pulled up with the cowcatcher
less than a foot away from him.
“Sturt” : The Law has been considering in
various aspects the case of a man who fell
off a country railway-platform in South Aus.
at night, and was badly damaged. The
Supreme Court found that the place was, as
the plaintiff claimed, insufficiently lighted,
but accepted the departmental contention
that tli is was an existing condition known
to the aggrieved person, and, therefore,
accepted by him when he walked, the plat-
form. So it gave the case against him;
but, to save time in case of an appeal (such
things are thought of in sensible South Aus.),
the Court examined the details of his in-
iuries. and recorded that they were worth
£llOO, if anything. The High Court has
now decided that the railways cannot get
out of their obligation to light stations pro-
perly by saying that everybody knows they
don’t light them ; so the judgment for £llOO
comes into force.
* -X- * *
"Squills”: A Sydney milk-supply co.
has been combining philanthropy with busi-
ness. In some of the meaner suburbs regu-
lar gifts of milk have been made to schools
on the understanding that the fluid would
be administered, at the rate of a pint a day,
to under-nourished and under-developed child-
ren. The records kept showed that one
kiddie, 61b. underweight for its age, put on
llilb. in four months, and there were other
testimonials equally gratifying to the quality
of the goods supplied. The concern which
started the experiment as part of a “More
Milk” Campaign now finds itself tied by a
sort of moral obligation. The condition of
the children fell off so rapidly when the sup-
plies stopped that the co. felt bound to con-
tinue its beneficence. All of which means
more ammunition for Dr. Arthur.
“Schnorrer” from handy to the ghetto:—
Israel Zangwill is understood to be developing a
scheme for a Jewish colony in Australia. But two
essentials of success for any such project would be the
grant of a large settlement area by one or other of
the State Governments, and adequate Jewish financial
support. Neither can be counted on. The most
active movers in promoting Jewish immigration from
Europe are pledged to the “Zionist” idea, which ap-
pears to offer a realisation of the age-long dream of
al! faithful Jews for a country of their own. There
are some 17 million Jews in the world (a lot of them
comfortable enough in America and British territories)
and Palestine may possibly absorb two millions of
them ; but until the colonisation of Palestine is accom-
plished the Zionists don’t believe in countenancing
any side-issues. Max Nordau advocated the Uganda
scheme, under which the British Government under-
took to provide the Jews with a country of their own,
and was denounced as a. renegade for his attitude ;
the same feeling led to the abandonment, a year ago,
of an offer by the Mexican Government to provide a
large territory exclusively for Jewish settlement. The
Jews who are going to Palestine —only a small per-
centage of the race at best—are enthusiasts who aie
taking to agriculture, inspired by a. racial ideal; but
there could be no guarantee that the Jews brought
in to make a settlement in any part of Australia
would not drift away to its large cities.
CLAIMING TIIE TITLE.
MRS. BROWN : "There, note! You let me
hear of you calling any other woman
your angel again an ’ I’ll do for you!”
“Renquillian” in reminiscent mood: —
Watching the finely disciplined men and splen-
didly equipped machines at work on a Sydney fire
t'other night my memory went back to another fire
only a block away—-half a century ago. In the blaze
the mother of one of my schoolmates was burnt to
death. It was a case of arson; the man who set
alight to the premises confessed that he did it to
get the few shillings that were paid in those days to
the one who raised the alarm. He was tried, con-
victed, and received a life sentence; I and others
wagged it from school to see him sent away. In
those days the railways ran a prison- van once a
week to the West. We knew the day and the plat-
form and one lad knew the man as well; as the
prisoners, all “legged” and handcuffed to chains,
passed from the Black Maria to the prison-van we
had a good look at the man who had made a
schoolmate motherless. A notable accessory of a
fire in those days was the alacrity shown by anyone
with a decent horse in clearing out of the way the
moment a firebell rang the alarm. The brigade
enjoyed the right—a legal one, I believe—to seize
the first horse regarded as suitable, put him in the
engine and flog him to the fire. There was a bonus
for first brigade at the fire, and for the first water
on the blaze.

Weary, heart and head.
Dancing round and round,

Sang the happy stars,
All their troubles o’er—
Happy, happy stars
Peaceful evermore!
Said a pleasant Voice:
“Weary is the Earth,
Troubled are his folk,
Vanished is their mirth—
Earth, behold, 1 come,

Then the Earth arose
Ailing not, nor sore,
Greeting Peace, his bride,

I u memory of Peter :—-
One day last week the words “Peter’s dead” were
heard in Parliamentary corridors, sawmill cottages
and .sleeper-cutters’ camps; and thousands of West-
ralians felt they had lost a friend, “Peter’’ was
Peter O’Loghlen, Labor M.L.A. for Forrest and best
of good fellows. He was a very raw young axeman
when he came out of the bush in 1300 to oppose
Bigjohn Forrest for Swan, but he displayed such fine
qualities that the Labor-people soon found a State
seat for him and kept it warm while they sent him
against Forrest in 1910 and 1913. He became so
popular in the Big Bush that he never had to fight
a State election or a selection-ballot. Timber-
workers, stranded in Perth, invariably sought out
Peter, sure that Peter would have a shot in the
locker for a distressed constituent. Study trans-
formed the green young woodcutter into a very
capable speaker and writer and an authority on
forestry. And though his health failed early he
never grew bitter, nor did Melancholy mark him for
her own. Possessed of a whimsical talent for
mimicry, lie could imitate Forrest blubbering at
the prospect of being'beaten by “this Peter O’Logh-
len,” and Colebatcii, whose speeches smelt of the
lamp, and do it to perfection; but rarely could he
be persuaded to give a taste of his quality—never
of late years in the case of Forrest, w'hom he
genuinely liked and admired. Only 41 was Peter
when the call came -to a brave and kindly soul.

JOE LYONS, the
new Labor Premier
of Tasmania.
In the re-shuffle of Ministerial billets in
South Aus. on the death of Chief Secretary
John Bice, Pascoe takes over that office, re-
taining Education, but handing over Public
works to Jenkins. The new member is
John Cowan, whose father was in the Assem-
bly long ago. He is a southern station-
owner, and takes Agriculture from Jenkins,
keeping at the same time an eye for town-
planning. D. J. Gordon (cx-Register chief
of staff) could probably have stepped into
office if he had wished ; but. in partnership
with Arthur Evans, the old inter-State
cricketer, he has built up a big company-
secretary business and can’t spare the time.
The death of Bice leaves Harwell the only
Minister who served under Peake.
Dr. Redwood, of Maoriland. is now de-

of his episcopate is to be celebrated next year.

and some mitres from overseas talk of taking
a hand.

stock auctioneers at Newmarket cattleyards,

MACE WEN. of
Scotland, the
King's surgeon
Exhibit “A” at
the big Melbourne
Medical Congress.
“Rounds” : It is not certain that Nichol-
son, Vic. Chief of Police, will stay for the
balance of the three years for which he was
appointed in April, 1922. Although they
have not said so officially, there are Minis-
ters who feel that the strike ought not to
have occurred. The strikers; by the way,
have made it much more difficult for a ranker
to rise to the top. Hence, no doubt, the
rumor that Gen. McCay was after the berth.
But it would hardly be worth his while. And,
besides, there are plenty A.I.F. officers who
are more popular.
R. R. Sholl, son of R. F. Sholl, late of
Federal Hansard, is the Vic. Rhodes
scholar for 1924 and something of a prodigy.
He had shot through the Junior Public
at 12, and annexed a cargo of prizes for
Latin and Greek, though he had time to also
win a prize from the Shakspearean Society.
At Trinity he collected the A. M. White
scholarship, and, casually seizing the B.A. in
his pursuit of further honors, set after the
Bromby prize for Biblical Greek. That safely
in his grip, he thought the Higgins scholar-
ship in classical poetry would suit him, but
here he had to share the first place with an-
other. Sholl is going for law at Oxford,
but being a good debater and a promising-
pressman, it is quite possible that politics
will ultimately claim him.
Lord Strathspey, ex-Maorilander, is tread-
ing his native shores again after 10 years
spent in Europe. The first thing he did on
stepping ashore at breezy Wellington was to
have a korcro with his former comrades in
the General Post Office, where, as a plodding
clerk, he put in seven dull years. He was
then the Hon. Ogilvie Grant.
Dr. Frank Noble, dead in Adelaide at
something under 40, was one of the first
British surgeons to get across to France on
the outbreak of war. He belonged to Too-
woomba (Q.), but happened to be in Eng-
land in 1914, A breakdown brought him
back to Australia, where he practised at
Broken Hill before moving down to Adel-
aide.
A. J. Foote, a stalwart 23-year-old Queens-
lander, is N.S.W. Rhodes scholar for 1924.
He came to Sydney ’Varsity from Ipswich
Grammar School in 1919, and has done splen-
didly in the medical school. In sport he got
a “blue” at athletics and Union Rugby, and
missed a rep. jersey last season with the
N.S.W. team in Maoriland when he chose
study rather than football. He is a dashing
wing-threequarter.
Owen Dixon, the Vic. K.C. who has been
drawing big fees from the Metropolitan Gas
Co. lately for appearing before the Select
Committee on the two Gas Bills, is off to
London by the Orsova to appear for the
pastoralists in the skin-wool appeal case.
This will be his second P.C. job within three
years.
If the Lawson team gets into recess at
the end of the year McPherson, the Trea-
surer, will probably become Agent-General.
He is one of the few eligible public men in
Vic. who can afford to take the job. The
couple of thousand and exes, is no good to
the man who has a shallow private purse
and a desire to be something more than a
head clerk.
Acting-Justice Weigall (Vic.) has had his
term extended till the end of next year. He
was raised to the Bench at the beginning
of 1923, when Justice Cussen went on his
health trip to Europe, and he will be wanted
next year because Irvine. C.J., will be away
in Ulster or somewhere. Weigall puzzled
his friends by refusing the permanent job
which Sclmtt subsequently got; lie didn’t
think the Bench his forte then.
_ St. John’s, the R.C. College in the Sydney
University, has had no luck so far as that
old Sydney bookworm, Thomas Donovan, is
concerned. First it missed the £30.000
which Newman College, in Melbourne, got—•
there was some question of unfulfilled con-
ditions. Though not really a rich man Mr.
Donovan had £20,000 left, and presently
available; this the Daily Telegraph said
was given “for University education in Syd-
ney, for the benefit of descendants of the
A.1.F.” As a matter of fact, this £20,000
was also offered to St. John’s; but again
conditions laid down were not fulfilled. Most
of the money has now gone into a farm near
< ’ampbelltown for the training as farmers
of destitute lads from Britain ; what is left
will be passed to the University.
Miss Isabella Kendall, who died at 80 the
other day, was a cousin of the poet Henry
Kendall. She had lived nearly all her life
at Milton (N.S.W.)—had been organist at
the local church for a matter of 60 years.
When death caught Brother Xavier Down,
of the Goulburn (N.S.W.) College, there
went out a really brilliant young mathe-
matician. He was a native of Wellington
(N.S.W.), and had taught successfully in
the capitals of three States. Cerebral
haemorrhage cut him off at 28.
“Pompey” Elliott, Senator and soldier, sent
out the fiery cross to A.I.F. men when he
agreed to co-operate in organising the special
Vic. police two days after the strike broke
out. There was a prompt response, and some
first-rate work was done ; but, to the, chagrin
of “Pompey’s” pals, he was shouldered aside
after the first few days, and McCay became
No. 1 when Monash went to Sydney for a
trip.
James Mitchell. Inspector-General of N. S.
Wales Police, had a “birthday” the other day
—the 40th anniversary of his joining the ser-
vice. His first job was on the old Central
Police Station, which used to be about where
the Queen Victoria Markets stand now. Mit-
chell, who is a big, quiet-voiced person, con-
cealing much strength of character beneath
an overlay of affability and tact, managed
Tom Mann’s miners in the big strike at
Broken Hill of a dozen years ago with fewer
cracked heads than a man of less geniality
could have believed possible. He was super-
intendent then, and became Inspector-Gen-
eral in 1914.
Charles Atkins, who was in the recent
running for the mayoralty of Melbourne, was
put aside on the ground mainly that he was
not sure of being in the next Council. As a
matter of fact, lie was defeated by a few,
votes—the only Melbourne councillor who
was not allowed a walkover. A circular to
ratepayers was issued from the United Pro-
testants’ Club informing all and sundry that
the man opposing Atkins was a “sturdy Pro-
testant,” whereas “Cr. Atkins has supported
and voted for the holding of St. Patrick’s Day
procession through the streets of the city, and
is being supported by the Roman Catholic
party.” So, because Atkins anticipated the
High Court’s decision by voting against a
futile attempt to stop St. Patrick’s Day pro-
cession, contending that the Council had no
power to stop it, he is represented as the
special protege of the R.C. party! This was his
reward for having consistently refused to in-
troduce questions of religion into municipal
matters. Had he announced himself as a
Church of Englander by birth and brother-in-
law to the Dean of Melbourne, he might
have routed the Orange Brigade.
Mick Ryan, Queensland’s big-gun squatter
and racing magnate, is one of the lucky men
from Ireland who sampled life in W. Queens-
land 30 years ago, and stuck to his guns
until riches came his way. By buy-
ing relief country in time and, later oil,
when fortune favored him, by acquiring sta-
tions far removed from one another, he man-
aged to juggle stock between drought-
stricken areas and well-grassed country, to
the great content of his banking account.
Mrs. A. J. Richardson, who passed out at S 4
in_ London recently, was the sister of the late
M. K. D’Arcy, the Mount Morgan million-
aire, who later did valuable work for Eng-
land in getting it interested in the Persian
oilfield. Mrs. Richardson’s husband was for
many years district surveyor at Rockhamp-
ton ; and it was after his death that she went
to England.

“Aarvi”: Gone to pass some remarks
about the chariots of the sun, Mick Dough-
erty, who. originally drove the coaches of
Crawford and Connclley in north-eastern
Vic. But he will be best remembered as
coachdriver to Mt. Buffalo. For years tra-
vellers competed for the box-seat that they
might tap his store of anecdote and dry
humor. He was 60 when lie called it a
day. Two other famous old jehus still sur-
vive—Jimmy Lyall, of Harrow, who used
to drive Cobb and Co.’s four-horse coach
half a century ago; and Tommy Cawker, of
Casterton. .Tames is still driving, but he
is only 75, a full 11 years younger than
Cawker.
Tom King, widely known in the A.I.F. as
“The Bishop,” has been chosen by the R.C.
Church in Australia to keep up the quota of
immigrants of the ancient faith from the
London end. Fie left with the sth
and 6th Artillery Brigades in 1915,
and was in the thick of the fighting
in the Salient in the following year.
A born organiser, he was later given control
of all A.I.F. chaplains of the R.C. faith. He
finished the war a Monsignor and an 0.8. E.
'He is not persona grata with the more pas-
sionate Hibernians of the hierarchy, being
an Australian born and bred, and without the
shadow of a. grievance against England: but
lie represents a large and ever-growing body
of opinion in the ranks of the locally-educated
priesthood.
The Last Post sounded in Sydney the
other day for 82-year-old Sergeant-Major John
Davidson Murray, whose young soldiering
days were spent in the Black Watch with in-
tervals of the real thing in the Indian hills,
Afghanistan and elsewhere. Until relieved a
little while ago he was superintendent of the
Veterans’ Home at Bare Island (N.S.W.).
Twenty-three years ago Staniforth Smith.
Administrator of Papua, now on a visit to
Australia, was Mayor of Kalgoorlie, where
he had a job in Reuter’s. An ambitious
young man, he had announced himself as a
candidate for the goldfields town in the State
Assembly, and his prospects looked bright
until liis committee unwittingly fractured
the electoral law by holding a meeting in a
pub. Realising that, if he got in, his elec-
tion would almost certainly be upset because
of this indiscretion of his agents. Stan,
changed his plans and nominated for the Com-
monwealth Senate at the first Federal elec-
tions. To the surprise of most people, he
topped the poll. But realising, quicker than
most men did at that period, that a Sena-
torial job was a mighty precarious thing un-
less the holder was prepared to sign the
Labor pledge, Smith dropped out at the end
of his six years. By that time he had begun
to rank as an authority on Australia’s tropi-
cal dependencies, on visits to which he had
spent all the time he could spare between
Parliamentary sessions, and the Papua job
was practically earmarked for him. - Fie has
held it ever since, except for two years when
he was with the A.I.F. (he joined up as a
private), and some months after his return,
when he officiated as figurehead in the
troubled Northern Territory.
THE AVERAGE MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
' Distinction is extinguished. The average man
represents a larger proportion of humanity than ever
before; and the average man is hopeless. "He has no
artistic tastes; he can only appreciate orthodox
standards of beauty.” —A highbrow critic, super-
ciliously.
He’s but an intellectual dud;
Artistic’ly his mind’s a frost ;
The beauty that may dwell in mud
On such a soul as his is lost:
A dirtbox in an alley grim
A simple dirtbox is to him.
Though in the battered tin may lie
The signs of many shattered dreams,
He cannot see them yvith my eye,
Or hear with me the muffled screams
Of oysters as they left the shells,
The poignant tale that silence tells.
Unheeded may the cabbage-leaf
Lie here, a green, fresh spirit hurt
By man’s misuse ; it. gives no grief
To one who merely deems it “dirt.”
And as bur tastes he will not share
IVe have a right to call them rare.
A simple clod, devoid of taste,
lie loves the sky, the seas, the flowers,
lie calls artistic garbage “waste,”
And scorns the passion that is ours
In rubbish bins to make our finds —
Tokens of rare and cultured minds!

Isko Automatic Electric Freezing Machines
Your own Cold Storage
Plant at Home.
ISKO is a simple device that
Manufactures Cold, convert-
ing your Refrigerator into a
miniature, self-operating Cold-
storage plant connected with the
house current, doing away entirely
with the use of Ice in the home as
a refrigerating agent, at the same
time introducing a method of
food preservation more conveni-
ent, more sanitary, more economi-
cal than that afforded by blocks
of melting ice.
It is an independent unit, can
be attached to any refrigerator or
Ice-box, and is absolutely fool-
proof.
It is automatic in operation and
so simplified mechanically that it
needs no expert attention.
It makes fifty cubes of Ice every
day.
The cost of current is trifling,
and the machine can be worked
on any voltage from 32 Volts up-
wards.
A complete model of this Isko
Automatic machine of one-ton

Refrigerator Cabinets made to order and machines fitted.
THE chambers and motor are
mounted on a single base,
which may be set on top of
the refrigerator or in an adjoining
room. The glycerine-tank, made
in sizes to fit various standard re-
frigerators, is placed in the ice
compartment and connected to
the machine by two seamless
copper tubes. The only moving
parts of Isko are the the two rotat-
ing gears of the compressor,
which run submerged in a sealed
chamber of oil and are direct con-
nected to the
motor. The refrigerant—a harm-
less gas—is also sealed in its
chamber. When cooled under
moderate pressure it becomes a
liquid, and as such is supplied to
the expansion coil of the tank,
where it expands into gaseous
form, extracting the heat from the
chest. When it has absorbed its
quota of heat the compressor re-
moves it from the expansion coil
and delivers it to the condenser
chamber, where the water, circu-
lating through the cooling coils,
carries off the heat, and the gas
again becomes a liquid and is
ready to start on another journey.
This simple process is carried on
in continuous cycles. Isko is auto-
matically operated, and can be set
to maintain any suitable degree of
cold in the refrigerator, the cur-
rent clicking on and off at the pre-
determined temperatures.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Jarrah”: Will Ogilvie’s suggestion (B.
18/10/’23) that the Australian brumby’s progenitors
were the three mares and a stallion which took
to the bush in Gov. Phillip’s time does not lend
much light ,to the subject. The brumbies of Queens-
land were known to the first settlers in those parts,
and, even supposing- that imported stock went wild
there, it would not account for the brumby of the
south-west of IV.A. This hardy and long-winded
animal abounded when the first white settler swung
his axe in the primeval jarrah forest. An old
resident told me how his father, trekking with
others from Albany into the then terra incognita,
found a species of wild pony which they afterwards
caught and domesticated. They had two methods
of catching them.—one way was to build a corral
around a waterhole in the summer, and the other
to shoot them in the thick muscle at. the back
of the neck: hit in the right place, the' animal
IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING.
THE BLIND MAN : “Thankee kindly, boy —’ ere’s
looking at yer!”
would fall stunned, and could be roped before it
came to. The breed of this brumby is quite distinct
from the Timor ponies which were introduced io
Northern Westralia at the end of the 16th century
by William Dampier.
“The Deacon” : Bushmen should begin to
lose faith in nicotine as a cure for snakebite after
a recent happening at Albury (N.S.W.). A railway
employee was bitten on the leg by a big tiger-snake,
and immediately anointed the spot with pipe-juice.
A temporary improvement followed, but later, be-
coming worse, he was rushed to hospital—where he
died, not from snakebite but from narcotic poisoning.
“P. Le Ij.” : Recent mention of sound
Sleepers recalls a nocturnal happening in our street
at Cobar (N.S.W.) a dozen years back. A miner
and his wife, abed on their front verandah, awoke one
morning- to find a third occupant sharing the nuptial
couch. The uninvited guest lived only a few doors
down the street, and, owing to a super-cargo of joy-
juice and the similarity in the structure of the cot-
tages, he had stumbled on to the wrong verandah.
The somnolent couple had been blissfully unconscious
of his advent. After the episode, front verandahs
in that locality were used exclusively for flowerpots
and goats.
"Saaedi”: “O. Archibald” (B. 18/10/’23)
is ■ surprised to And that very few thoroughbreds
know how to buck. As a matter of fact, there aren't
many horses, thoroughbred or otherwise, that under-
stand even the beginning of the noble art. Ask
any experienced breaker. Of course, there is a lot
in the way the young things are handled prior to
mounting. It often happens that the dare-devil
fellows who can stick tighter to a horse than the
brand itself, are not the best breakers. To begin
with, they are likely to mount colts insufficiently
mouthed and handled, which often gives, the young-
sters bad habits. Further, they have somewhat too
liberal views as to what is a quiet horse. The
best breaker I ever knew was a chap who put a
very high value on life, and was moreover only a
middling rider.
* * * *
“Sarah”: I hardly think “2555” (B.
20'/9/’23) is correct in deducing that his dog' Slasher
has a dingo strain in him simply because he scratches
for water on the margin of the river when the
stream becomes too salty. My little foxy the other
day was pretty thirsty, so he ran to the cattle-
troughs, which the children generally allow to run
over. Upon finding the usual puddle-hole merely mud
he scratched down about Bin., and then waited a
while till the soakage water settled, after which he
enjoyed his drink.
* * * *
“Sir Speii”: Cheerful optimism has ever
been one of the mainstays of the man on the land.
A man from A longway out, upon receipt of a notifica-
tion from the Lands Department that his rent was
in arrears, wrote recently as follow's: —
Youre notis to hand. Pleese could you giv me
an eckstention of payment, as vvhot with the bad
times weave been haveing I find it hard to make both
ends meet, and that is saying rfuthing. of the six
children -I have do support, and probibly six more to
follow.
“Tame Whei” : The Council lias instanced
some ’ remarkable fluids in the
stomachs of cattle. Here is
another right in our own back
yard. In the * Superintendent’s
office at the State abattoirs,. Home-
bush Ray (Sydney), I was shown
recently a piece of bough, black
and hard like ebony, about 18in.
long by llin. thick. Ori it are
the stumps of several branches,
each some inches long. One end
is split, and wedged in the split is
an iron spike about Sin. by |in.
This assembly was found in the
stomach of a beast slaughtered at
the abattoirs last season. The
animal was in prime condition
and the stomach uninjured.
“Pick” : In the blade-
shearing days the fastest barber
was the “ringer”; later, he was
the “gun”; nowadays he is a
“deucer.” He ia not always the
man who draws the biggest cheque
at the cut out. Any day some
runner-up may determine to give
the “deucer” a fly, and the con-
stant. severity of his exertions to
hold his reputation often incapaci-
tates him, and compels a sick day
in the hut, while his less speedy
but more consistent opponents are
earning a regular wage. At Gun-
ningrah shed I saw little McCarthy,
who was turning out the fifth tally
on the daily sheet, challenge the
ringer, Norris, and cut him out
of five sheep in a two-hours’ run.
Then, having enjoyed himself, Mack
smilingly dropped back to his
customary steady blow. And at
Redbank one shearing, exasperated
by a sneer respecting his capa-
bilities With the machines, Bill
Green, supposedly a second-rater,
opened out on Harrison, who was
easily ahead, and for the re-
mainder of the time beat him by
upwards of a dozen sheep a day.
“Nanangoat”: As a temporarily-retired
bagman let me have a piece of “Baro” (B. 18/10/’23).
The picnicker of that name must surely be subsidised
by the Flour Combine. We professionals do not turn
our johnny-cakes frequently, as by such treatment the
confections become hopelessly charred. I agree with
“Blunder Buss” (B. 30/8/’23) to this extent, that
the competent chef lightly flattens the heap of live
coals (not pounds them) before placing the dainties
thereon. If the coals are very bright a smell of
burning will very likely follow, but on turning the
johnny once—and once only—it will be noticed that
the cake is charred only at the few immediate points
of contact with the live embers. “Baro” is wrong
in saying that all timbers are equally good—of those
mentioned by him boree alone would be taken by a
dinkum traveller. As for pine and mulga—well,
why not also take bloodwood and stringybark, the
THE RIPPLES OF WAR.
“You won’t throw these boomerangs round here again. You’ve broke me bar window.
I’ll burn ’em.”
“Boss, mine sorry. That phella must bin get longg air-pocket.”
curses of the open-flre cook? About the only hope of
making johnnies with embers from these woods would
be in the Hindu style, i.e., toasting them, as the mere
placing of anything on the embers seems to take all
the life from them. The spreading of a heap of mulga
embers is sufficient to “kill” them also. Some of
. the ironbarks, a few varieties of gums, most dry,
scrub timbers, boree, gidya, yarran, myall, belah
and white box are all excellent for cooking “charcoal
tarts.” The swaggies’ damper, which “Baro” says
is made with butter and baked with the aid of, ai tin
dish, impels me to ask, in the name of the president
of the Bagmen’s Union, where “Baro 1 ” has humped
Matilda. I would like to And that happy spot where
dripping, butter and tin dishes attach themselves to
the practising members of my fraternity. On receipt
of reliable information I intend to “tie a knot, in
it” and take on a settled job carting sand with
which to cover “Baro’s” swaggies’ dampers.

“Nitric”: “Riverina’s” youngster whose
cheek was pierced by a cow’s horn (B. l/11/’23),
the cow remaining at the other end thereof, reminds
me of a Queensland lad of four, who, while swinging
underneath the house, made an extra effort, and
succeeded in hooking himself on a large meat-hanger.
The hook entered the lip and emerged just below' the
eye. The lad was suspended in mid-air until his
cries brought assistance. I’ve been sorry for all
my piscatory successes since I heard of that queer
catch.

“Centurion”: Re “Cobba Cobba's” 46-year-
old pony.that has had molasses for every meai. Any
member of the A.L.H. in the Big War will agree
that molasses, in the form of sucrepaille —mixed
with chopped barley straw’ —was the chief factor,
apart from their breeding, in the Australian horses’
extraordinary endurance in the Sinai and Palestine
campaigns. Sucrepaille was a regular ration for
these horses, once work in the open was commenced,
and there is no doubt in my mind that it made tre-
mendously for endurance. The idea is not a new
one; in the last Boer War, when light columns of
mounted men chased the Boer guerillas till the
hqrses were fairly run off their feet, brow’n sugar
was issued as a special ration for the animals. It
not only kept them in better condition, but horses
were willing to eat the sweetened stuff when too
tired to face their ordinary feed.
“Jim Domino”: “Lou's” stations where the
night-horse is left feedless (B. l/11/’23) must be
run by blacks. I have ’rooed on some of th« largest
holdings in N.S.W., and have never yet seen the
night-horse go without tucker. His daily routine as
I have known it has been: Horse tailing, 5.30 a.m.
till 6.30; butcher musters the milkers, 6.30
till 7 a.m.; the horse then spells till after-
noon, when the cows are mustered again. Two or
three times a week killing (ration) sheep are re-
quired, necessitating another short journey for the
night-horse. Compared with the station saddle-
horse, which has to battle for its tucker in the
paddock, the night-horse’s job looks good. Anywav,
a station-horse is changed once a week, and the
night-horse once a month —which speaks for itself.
* * * *
“Birre Gurra” : I was driving up a moun-
tain road with one of the settlers. He was fairly
drunk, when we left the pub, and damned drunk
when we arrived at the Big Gutting. I looked over
the side and gazed at the tangled mass of timber
and huge rocks a thousand feet or so below. Then
I looked at my companion. He was fast asleep.
With a yell I grabbed the reins, but the old chap woke
up and retained possession of them. “I’ll drive!"
I said; “give me the reins, and you can have a
snooze.” His eyes roved over my city togs. “No,
by eripes, yer won’t,” he said—“l wouldn't trust
yer!” He waved the whip over the old horse and
promptly went to sleep again.
“Larry Longun”: I don’t know why the
hide from a white beast should be better than that
from, all others (B. 18/10/’23) ; but 1 know that
the toughest hide of all, next to a politician’s, js
that of a healthy working bullock which has' died
A SPACIOUS INSECT.
ENRY: “’Ow big didger say that merskeeter
was you killed in Queensland?”
JAMESIE: “ Better wait till we get outside,
'Enry. There ain’t room to tell yer
in ’ere.”
suddenly in the yoke, or has had to be destroyed as
a result of some mishap. On the other hand, the
hide from a beast which has died from an illness
lasting over several days and accompanied by high
fever is among the rottenest. The poorest hide of
all is that from a beast which has died of starva-
tion, While tough enough, it is usually too thin
and too much knocked' about as a result of the ani-
mal struggling on the ground to be of much value.

HAY-TIME.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Yellow are the low hills and yellow is the corn,
Nodding on the uplands that kindle in the morn.
Sappy is the stubble that the red reaper leaves,
Dotting all the hay-land with far-flung sheaves.
Bird song is blithe yet where hope lives anew —
A tall crop gladdens with the sparkle of the dew!
Summer gives the gold grain or summer takes away;
But the: e is purple autumn and the green of May!
Here along the uplands and over every hill
The tall stalks ripen and the bronze heads fill ;
Suddenly the sun flares and fires the busy day,
Flashing on the reaper and the far-flung hay.

POVERTY NOT RESPONSIBLE.
“Did poverty bring yon to this?"
“ No, it didn’t. I was simply coining money, old top."
“Tabak”: My entry for the Endurance
Stakes. An 11-year-old Papuan left our plantation
at 6 a.m. on a Wednesday, with a letter for a mis-
sion station in the mountains 80 miles away, and
reached there at 6 p.m. the same day, notwithstand-
ing that he had to climb ranges over 3000 ft.
high! Leaving the station at 6 a.m. the
following day, he got home a’t 4 o’clock that after-
noon—and promptly flew to the football ground!
WELL WOUNDED.
“After ’ im, chootn! You’ve blowed his two front legs off!"
“A.J.J.T.”: “Hamer's” stingray incident
(B. 25/10/’23) reminds me of a case I
attended surgically in Carnarvon (W.A.). A youth
while fishing landed a stingray, which, although
speared, swung its sting round and firmly embedded
it in the lad's foot, just behind the toes. About 6in.
was sticking in his foot when he was brought to me.
I anaesthetised the youth, and after incision around
the sting extracted it. The patient liad no ill effects
and the wound healed by first intention, the best way.
The only disability was a stiffness of the foot —it
later kept him fi'oin going- to the war. There were
no poisonous symptoms whatsoever; but as this is
the only ease of the kind I’ve ever seen, I do not
want to pose as an authority. Incidentally, the sting
of this ’rav, 6in. from the sharp end, was about
the thickness of an average finger. The point was
sharp, and all the way along the sting were innumer-
able very sharp barbs, which prevented the sting-
being removed without free incision around it.

“Cow Cocky”: Those egg-laying roosters
that some of the Council have been blowing about
lately haven’t got it all their own way, as witness
this advt. in the Grafton (N.S.W.) Examiner
(21/8/’23) :
For Sale, 2 Dairy Bulls, young and quiet, newly
calved. Apply B. Blank, Great Marlow.
1 have written for full information with regard
to the milk yield and butter-fat test of the mar-
vellous pair, and when this comes to hand I’ll
communicate with the Council.
“B a r o” : Old
Dan Fogarty used io
snort whenever he
heard me refer to my
baking-powder loaf as
a damper. “Look it
here, sonny,” he’d say
—“a damper is made
wid plain flour, salt
and water, and don't
you be after calling
that blanky thing a
damper jist because
ye’ve baked it in the
ashes.” Then lie would
gather up his. dishes
and picks and shovels
and march off in the
everlasting search for
the golden fortune lie
never found. But how
would poor old Da n
take it if he could
hear “Jimmy Possum”
(B. 25/10/’23) trying
to palm off a griddle-
cake as a johnnie or
damper? He has been
at rest a good while
now, so I suppose be
could only protest in
the way permitted to
those in his state by
rotating in his grave.
“Tiny”: I am not surprised at “X2X-’s”
sufferer (B. l/11/’23) who failed to get rid of the
“Barcoo spew” when he went to Temora (N.S.W.)
from Bananaland. I first contracted the loathly thing
in that district, and I’d never been much further
north or south previously, though a subsequent Spring
in Queensland found me with the disease intensified.
The last few years have been spent mostly in Vic.,
and I thought I’d laid the ghost, but five weeks
ago, after months in Melbourne, the “rot” made
its appearancP. Even a few weeks in the snow
country round Warburton failed to quell it. Here
in the AVimmera district I have met lumping and
telegraph gangs with arms, hands and lower limbs
dotted with suppurations, though, beyond a seedy
feeling,. the “spew” symptoms are absent. I agree
with “X2X” that etiological factors are not essen-
tial. I have known two vegetarians and numerous
near-vegetarians to be affected. Neither can over-
indulgence in booze he blamed, as I have seen liaisons
and typists with bandaged mitts. But I have always
noticed that the less sedentary a person’s occupa-
tion the greater his chance of contracting the dis-
ease and the more virulent it will he.
* * * *
“Billy Brolga”: “Nugget’s” cattle, which
died of prussic-acid poisoning after feeding on blue
couch (B. 18/10/’23), recall a number of cases
in various parts of Bananaland some years back m
which pigs and cattle were poisoned by eating sweet-
potato vines. A relative of mine lost 17 half-grown
pigs in this way. The cookies were mystified, and
thought alt sorts of things till it was discovered
that prussic-acid was the cause. It seems that in
the case of sweet-potato vines, this deadly poison
is present in harmful quantities only when , there is
a very rank growth of vine, such as occurs during
very wet and very- warm weather.
“Pohutu” ; Re decoying sheep into a race
(B. l/11/’23). A few years back nearly all of the
coastal tramps working the Maoriland live-stock trade
used to carry a pet sheep to lead the juinbucks up
the gangway; but one tub, the Squall, belonging t o
the U.S.S. Go., which traded along the cast coast
from Russell (Bay of Islands) to Napier, had a
pet deer. The animal belonged to the skipper,
and was as much at home aboard as the ship’s cat.
It was timid when ashore, especially at Napier,
where the appearance of the little shunting engine
on the wharf was always the signal for a gangway
rush that put the loading of the juinbucks back
by as much time as it took to get . the squeaking
loeo. out of the immediate vicinity.
“The Rumpus” : Mrs. Binghi liad recently
brought a son into the world, and I drew the father
aside and suggested that he collect the baby bonus.
Old man Binghi,was puzzled arid sought more light.
“Why,” I said, “you’ll get £5 for the piccaninny."'
The black buck shook his head with deep conviction.
“No fear,” he said. “That kid worth £50.”
“Centre” : Why all this abuse of the star-
ling? It looks as though those who denounce the
bird do so on the hearsay of others who know
less than nothing about it. Personal and careful
observation has satisfied me that the starling does
far more good than harm. I have watched the
parent birds of two broods during the past fort-
night, and, as the nests are not more than 6ft. from
my window, I have seen plainly the brand of pro-
visions on which they are feeding their families.
Grubs of every description all the time, and the
birds going hard right through the day from be-
fore sunrise till dark. Each bird averages 30 trips
an hour. With four adult birds going strong for
12 hours of daylight that works out at 1440 grubs
—surely a pretty good cheek on the insect hosts.
And that estimate only allows one grub to each
journey, arid does not include what the old birds
consume themselves.
* * * *
“Dr. Nil” : Re “P.D.N.’s” negro who became
white (B. 11/10/’23), the change 'commencing on
one leg and progressing nearly all over his skin.
‘Albinos are born without the natural pigment in
their skin, hair, eyes, etc., but persons like this'
chameleonic nigger are suffering from a harmless
but disconcerting complaint known .as .vitiligo or
leueoderma. Sometimes •it comes without known
cause. Sometimes after certain fevers.
“Pat Busliie”: “Ivobbi” (B. 18/10/ 23)
says he’ll “plump hard for the frogmouth as the
worst builder,” and remarks on the flimsy hold-your-
breath nature of her nest. Well, I’ll plump harder
that if he pulls a frogmouth’s nest to pieces he
cannot reconstruct it half as well as the original.
* * * *
“Booral” : In our oyster-camp to-day I
saw our collie, who is full of fun, cavorting about
curiously in some long grass, and, thinking he had
a mouse, 1 went to give him a hand. But when I
got a bit closer I found he had a 3ft. green snake.
He didn’t seem to be doing it any harm —was just
playing with it. On the other hand, the snake
didn’t attempt to bite him, although it had many a
chance. I killed the wriggler, as I have a little
three-year-old girl who plays about the paddock;
but can any Abo. enlighten me as to what those
two were at?
* * * *
“Exul”: Someone recently credited Dam-
pier (visited Australia in 1688) with being the
first white man to see and describe the kangaroo.
But according to ,J. Moore Robinson, F.R.G.S., this
honor belongs to Captain Francis Pelsart, whose
ship, the Batavia, was wrecked in 1629 on the
Houtmans Abrollios, a dangerous group of islands
just opposite Geraldton (W.A.) :
With a few of his sailors, Pelsart reached the
mainland shore, and for several days explored the
country. He eventually reached Java in the Batavia’s
boat and reported in unfavorable terms on what he
had observed. His only claim to fame lies in the
facts that his was the first authentic account of
the coast and he was the first white man to record
a description of the kangaroo.
•* * * *
“Nakhoda”: Do fishes play V The por-
poises in the Swan River near Perth certainly
appear to do so. I once watched four charge full
tilt at the back of a sandbank which juts out
from South Perth near the Narrows. There was
just enough water for them to shoot across it—all
of their bodies except the garboard strake showing
in the sun —and tumble into the deep water on the
other side. At first I thought they were after fish,
but when I saw them return in pairs again and
again to the same spot, and dash across in a lather
of sand and foam, I decided that there must be some
other attraction about the dangerous occupation.
Do they get a pleasurable sensation out of the
SAFE.
“'Ow did she come to tell you all that?"
“She knew that I could he depended upon
to keep it a secret."
friction of t lie sand on their bodies, or are they
troubled with barnacles like the whales that rub
along the N.S.W. coast? Or are they just enjoying
the fun like boys on a mud slide?
"Yamim": The quaintest man-animal
friendship of my experience 1 struck at Bungendove
(N.S.W.), where a Spaniard named Lopez, rouseabout
for a butcher, made a pet of a pig. The animal
used to follow him about like a dog, and shared
the old fellow’s bunk with him. Wherever Lopez
was, there would Bessie be—or not far away. The
pig originally belonged to the butcher, who wanted
to kill it, but Lopez bought the unclean thing and
kept it by him until it died. This was the only
domesticated pig in the district that ever succumbed
to old age. After Bessie's demise the Spaniard
was grief-stricken and became seriously ill. He
was removed to the Queanbeyan hospital, where he
died a week later.
* * » *
“Herodot”: Recently a traveller passed
through Mudgee (N.S.W.) with his swag strapped
to the back of his dog, which also carried the billy-
can in his mouth. The swag was about the size
of the ordinary Matilda and was held in position
by specially-constructed harness. The tyke didn’t
seem to object to the arrangement, and, according
to his owner, frequently covered from 15 to 20
miles a day with swag and can.
THE HOVER’S ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I hear the rover’s call once more,
The call of wind and tree,
And in my heart I know
That I must rise and go ;
For he who is a rover-born
A rover still must be !
There is a road, a rolling road
Well known to roving men ;
Its very dust beguiles
My feet to tread its miles,
For he who treads that, rolling road
Must tread that road again.
At ordered walks and bordered paths,
And garden-nooks and bowers.
Shut in by bars and bolts,
My rebel soul revolts :
For I am kith and kin of those
Who love the wildwood flowers.
The call conies down the wind, and stirs
A fever in my breast.
It sounds unceasingly
And will not let. me be;
For 1 am of the wayward folk
Who cannot be at rest.
“Come, rover, come,” it seems to say,
“With roof and wall he done.
With narrow court and way.
And crowded night and day ;
For you are one with those who claim
Bright kinship with the sun.
“Come rover, come and taste the calm
No thought of trouble mars —
That calm untenable
That conies to those who dwell
By lonely fires in western camps
Beneath the midnight stars.
“Come, rover, take the rover’s road,
And take it with a song ;
The bending skies invite,
The dawn, the noon, the night;
And wings shall take the place of feet
To speed your soul along.
“To lose yourself in golden noon,
To mingle with its flood.
To feel yourself as one
With earth and air and sun- —
All tawdry things cast off the while-
Were this not sweet and good?
“Were it not fine at set of sun
When rock and tree are lit,
To stand upon some hill,
Alone, enrapt and still.
And feel the rich enchantment take
And make you one with it?
“Come, rover, come and quit the world !
It little cares for you
And all you are and seem,
And all you know and dream,
And all the paltry things you've done,
And all you hope to do.
“Come, rover, come- -I am the voice
Of all that’s wild and free;
1 call oil whom 1 know.
And roving you must go;
For he who is a rover born
A rover still must he."

PIONEER LEATHER BELTS
are evidence of its working efficiency no less than its wearing qualities.
Minimise your expenditure on belting repairs and renewals by specifying
Pioneer Leather Belting for every drive.

Miles Franklin, the girl who in 1901
set Australia talking about her first and
only book. “My Brilliant Career,” is ex-
pected hack in Sydney within the next few
weeks. She would have been here now but
for an overwhelming desire to link up with
American friends on her way from London.
When Miles left Australia some years ago
her stars took her to tin' U.S.A., where she
was drawn into the Welfare Settlement move-
ment. She flung nil the enthusiasm and
energy of youth into it, and effected a great
improvement in factory and shop conditions
for the working woman. Her plan was to
take a job promiscuously, and then write
with Australian candor of (lie abuses she
had observed in connection with it. It was
good work, and the only objection her home-
land nurses is that it probably absorbed this
continent’s strongest woman novelist. Miles
was in England for the last Shakspearonn
festival, and was then very sick. The Tahiti
is booked to bring her back to her own people.
After a short stay with her own people,
Miles Franklin returns to the States to
handle town-planning schemes.
Anders Zorn, the most renowned artist
Scandinavia has produced, is being intro-
duced to the Sydney that knows its way to the
Hordern Galleries. Only fully-clothed etch-
ings by the famous one are on view in the
big room; the nudes, so careful are the Cus-
toms of our morals, are in a cabinet- —and
not even one with glass panels. However,
the cabinet has a key, and, if you are known
to the heads as an Art Connoisseur, you are
given a peep. And then you find that only
the price is staggering. It is worth while
being a creative genius in Scandinavia. When
Ibsen went into a cafe the whole assemblage
got on its feet, men bowed and women waved
their hankies (incidentally, what a pile of
hankies that climate must call for!) and
nobody dreamed of sitting down till the old
wizard who had invoked “Ghosts” had his
knees under the tablecloth. When Zorn died
they gave him no end .of a send-off. His body
was taken to the grave on a sled drawn by
six coal-black horses, their necks garlanded
with crimson berries. Here we can’t even
raise a memorial in stone to poor Henry
Lawson.
Artist Septimus Power seems equally at
home with water-colors and oils. His show
at Anthony Horderns’ Gallery depicts with
great faithfulness Dobbin and the family
hound in varied grades of social life. That
lie has some ardent admirers was shown by
the sprinkling of red seals that bloomed on
the frames an hour after the exhibition
opened itself last Friday. Two striking can-
vases are “The Timber Team” and “Harrow-
ing,” and there’s an exquisite smaller piece,
“After Rain.” This artist has a feeling for
big timber and the hush almost of the inten-
sity shown by Heysen and by Longstaff in
some of his early paintings. He is still busy
on his commissioned War Memorial for
Melbourne.
That William Moore who 50 years ago
visualised a community settlement at Gor-
don, in the Shire of Kuringai, is dust and
grass, but his dream lives after him. The
trustees of the estate some time ago offered
prizes for the best layout of the 800 acres
of land and for plans of a typical house
and communal hall. The result was a great
rolling-up of shirt-sleeves among the artists
and an exhibition of plans that filled the
spaces in Farmer’s Hall last week. Min-
ister for Local Government J. C. L. Fitz-
patrick introduced the show with compli-
mentary words; Norman Pope, who directs
Farmer’s, hovered about; and General
Rosenthal, president of the Institute of
Architects, gave a further cheer or two.
Keith Harris plucked first prize, both for
the design of the settlement and for the
typical house: and Leith McCredie was a
good runner-up.
The Victorian League has been at home
for the last time this season ; and the rooms
of the Women’s Club rustled with frocking-
suggestive of sound bank balances and cer-
tainty of Heaven. The Cullen lady gave the
cordial eye and the welcome hand to the
stream of guests, her black-and-silver frock-
ing brightened by the rich tone of daughter
Ailsa’s blue raiment. Secretary Beulah Bol-
ton announced the arrivals in a clear tone
that would place her butler act in a high
niche in Repertory circles. Pianist Myrtle
Meggy stirred the soul of the most-of-tlie-time
locked-up grand in the assembly-room, and
Mrs. George Earp cascaded song above hand-
some gold tissue. Mrs. Roystone Davey was
a handsome black-frocker: so was Mrs.
Toohey. And good-looking Mrs. David land-
say was an attraction among the younger set.
Muriel Holdsworth, who, after an evening
ceremony at St. Canace’s, will be Mrs. Hugh
Ward, junior, before the world’s a Bulletin
older, spent most of last week displaying her
trousseau to her own flapper and mother’s
more ballasted friends. The home flat at
Woollahra resembled a wardrobe till the
very last moment. Dresses and coats on
hangers jostled one another all round the
rooms, while mountains of vari-colored lin-
gerie made other parts of the premises look
as though a rainbow had taken up residence
there. The last flip to the mayonnaise was
a young-thing gathering at the Hugh Wards’
Potts Point gunyah on Friday night, a
“shrimp and lobster party." There’s a big
electric-lit waterhole at the foot of the
grounds, and here the lads and lasses held
a swimming carnival; but the sea food was
eaten later on within doors. Young Hugh
goes to Melbourne to help manage the new
combine’s theatres in the City of Sudden
Upheavals.
Good-looking Pauline McMorran duly kept
tryst at St. James’s with George Walker,
under the eye of all fashionable Sydney that
was not then in Melbourne for the races and
the riots. An aviary of surplioed choir-
boys warbled triumphantly while Padre
Mieklem slipped on the gyves. The frock
was a marvellous swathe of white crepe
Romaine, and the square of Limerick lace
that did duty as a train suggested the em-
barrassment of riches. And it took away from
the statuary effect, too. Mary Langtree
bridesmaided in satin frocking as luscious as
apricots and cream. The Wentworth staged
the reception, hostessed by bride’s mother in
black frocking armored with steel-grey em-
broideries.
The Chapel of St. John’s, in the Univer-
sity, staged an unusual event one night last
week, when Pauline Sullivan, of Neutral
Bay, was linked for life to William Molday,
of Maoriland. Pauline brought a froth of
white satin and silver-ribbon ruchings to
the linking, and was supported by sisters
Madeline and Mollie, who both flew green
frocking and flower-wreathed black millinery.
The best man answered to the sporting name
of Risk; and the groomsman was ('aptain
Nobbs. The wedding feast at the Carlton
was hostessed by the bride’s aunt.
Pretty Quakeress Margaret Thorp, who
looks after the welfare work of Anthony
Horderns’ vast colony, is flying a pinker rose
than ever in each cheek, for her young man,
Arthur Watts, is on his way to Australia.
Margaret and he first met in stricken Europe
when Margaret was a sort of advance dove
from the Friends’ ark, and he was engaged
in reconstruction work in the harried coun-
tries of France, Poland and Russia. The
two are also well known in Australia and
Maoriland for their voluntary war relief
work. Mr. Watts administered the funds
of Lady Forster’s appeal for stricken Europe ;
it was he who distributed the B.A.W.R.A.
wool (which was the means of establishing
village industries with whose proceeds the
peasants paid for food) ; and the £90,000
worth of frozen meat and the wheat con-
signment donated by the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment were allocated under his eye. He
deserves his Margaret. She deserves almost
anything.
Herewith Lilian McDonald, one of Mrs.
Christian’s sweetest songbirds, who makes
her trial
flight at the
Conse r v a-
torium next
Saturday, the
24 th. She
hails from the
South Island
of Maoriland,
and first
studied her
art with the
Do mini can
nuns of Dun-
edin, who are
famed in the
Rickety Isles
for their
method of
voice - produc-
tion. Lilian’s
voice is a
dramatic so-
prano, and
will be heard
in works by Schumann, Rachmaninoff and
Coleridge Taylor. Coming from Otago, ye
ken, the fledgling ends her pi’ogramme with
“Annie Laurie,” of course.
A new engagee is Pearl Dobell, of Chisle-
lmrst, Double Bay, to Wallace Bridge, son
of the Clarence Bridges, of Kirribilli. The
Dobells control the sale of Remington type-
writers in Australia.
Dorothy Gellatly, of Neutral Bay (her dad
was Dr. Gellatly, commercial editor of the
S. M. Herald), is sporting the usual dia-
mond option on her hand, placed there by
Neville Menlove, of Cootamundra.
Soon after Dame Margaret Davidson
arrives in London she will proceed to the
Continent and put the children to school in
the south of France. She will then return
to her brother, General Geoffrey Feilding, who
is a bachelor and Military Commandant of
the City of London.
Dame Margaret’s tribute from the women
of N. S. Wales runs to over £l4OO. The
committee met at Mayoress Gilpin's rooms
at the Town Hall the other day, and amid
the clatter of teacups the last loose ends
were tied up and arrangements made for
sending on the cheque.
Ivambala, the well-known Rose Bay school,
run by Miss Roseby—two Miss Rosebys. in
fact —has entered into a new era. It is
spreading out as a Church of England Foun-
dation School under a council. Tivoli
Heights, at Rose Bay, with its beautiful
grounds, will be its home ; and the girls will
now have their own bathing enclosure and
boatsheds.
The other day, when the papers said that
Thomas Donovan had given £lOOO to the
N.S.W. branch of the Astronomical Associa-
tion, people asked who Thomas Donovan
w as; an d
most of them
had to turn
to Johns’s
“Who’s Who”
for an answer.
Tlier e they
found out
little more
than that he
had also given
£30.000 to help
build Newman
College, Mel-
bourne. St.
John’s, within
Sydney Uni.,
should ha v e
ha d that
money; but
certain condi-
tions which
Mr. Donovan
required it to
fulfil were not
carried out.
Lately the old philanthropist—who will
probably hate to be called that —has been
greatly interested in a farm he bought at
Campbelltown, outside Sydney, for the train-
ing chiefly of immigrant boys; and thither
he has had transported and re-erected the
hall which formed part of the old Girls’ High
School premises in Castlereagh-street. It is
a place full of historical associations: the
Anglicans used it for service; it was lent
to the R.C.’s while the first part of St.
Mary’s was being built; and later the Phil-
harmonic is believed to have been born there
—anyway, it practised there. Mr. Donovan
was a member of the Phil, himself in far-
off days: he is well past 80 now. In his
hermit life-like his late brother, the barris-
ter, he never married—books are his constant
companions. And there is a sister who
stands beside him. and together they look on
the passing world merely as interested spec-
tators.
Mrs. Lazzarini, mother of tw'o politicians
—an M.L.A. and an M.H.R.—died at Mar-
rickville a week or so back. A lady with
many activities in spite of her 77 years, her
popularity drew shoals of votes for the sons,
whose seats include the district in which she
lived.
A fete in aid of Lewisham Hospital is to
he opened on Friday by Dr. Sheehan, the
R.C. Coadjutor-Archbishop. This will be his
first public appearance since his arrival in
Australia over 12 months ago. 111-health,
which gripped him when he landed, is just
letting go. Archbishop Kelly, though now
well on his way to the eighties, is still able
to flit round and get through a vast amount
>f public work and private devotions.
After an absence in foreign parts of nine
months or so, E. J. Tait w'ill return to Syd-
ney in a few days with a suitcase full of
new theatrical tricks and four-figure con-
tracts —relating, of course, to absolutely un-
paralleled and never-previously-attempted
stage attractions. All that the old Firm may
hit Hugh Ward a staggering blow in the
box-office.
Portia Geach is leading her Housewives to
battle under the banner of “Yes, we will have
no potatoes.” The one-time homely spud has
been putting no end of value upon herself
lately, and is quite beyond the reach of the
working- and middle-classes. So the House-
wives have declared a boycott, though exactly
how that is going to encourage more people
to grow the generally unprofitable tuber isn’t
clear. Incidentally, this Letter heard the other
day of a woman who valued her potato-
patch higher than her honeymoon. She’s a
country lady, and after many years of single
blessedness she slipped into double harness.
After the wedding the happy pair climbed
into a sulky and drove to the nearest railway
station. A well-meaning neighbor, seeing
them banked about with luggage on the sta-
tion platform, sauntered up and offered to
take the horse and trap home for them. “Oh.
Jim’s going hack,” said the bride, nodding
towards her spouse. “You see, I couldn't go
on my wedding trip with an easy mind if 1
thought the potatoes and peas were being neg-
lected.''
Photographer Monte Luke is wearing a
halo of reflected glory. His brother in Tas-
mania drew Bitalli in Tatt.’s, and there arc
few things in the Commonwealth more im-
pressive than to win Tatt.’s.
The City of Sydney (nee Redfern) Band
gave a farewell concert in the Town Hall on
Thursday, with the idea of getting a bit
towards taking them to London, where they
intend competing at the Empire Exhibition.
But the concert failed to win the support it
deserved, and some beautiful music echoed
through long avenues of empty chairs. The 11-
year-old prodigy, James Walker, his hair
standing upright with temperament —or it
may have been just small-boy shyness—was
the starred soloist, and his playing of the
Beethoven Sonata and the Chopin number
proved him on the right track towards the
high place which the critics predict for him.
The small pianist is now studying with
Stephen Polotynski, who conducted the band
in its opening work, the Siberian Prelude,
which is from his own pen. Sydney has
wiped some of the tragic gloom from this
young man’s brow. But the sight of the
Siberia in the-hall must have traced a line
or two on the face of W. M. Partington,
the real conductor of the combination, which
is to set out on a tour of Maoriland before
proceeding on its longer and more ambitious
venture.
Mrs. Fotheringliame’s Junior Austra-
lians. which has taken the place of the
once popular Young Australia —a war vic-
tim—made its curtsey to the public last
week. It is an engaging little paper filled
with pleasant reading matter and good illus-
trations. There are puzzles, and competi-
tions, and well-told stories, and a page of
recipes and gardening notes.
A Brisbane postscript:—
One of the first things Sir Matthew did when
ho got back from Mackay was to go to La-szlo
Schwartz’s concert in the Albert Hail. The Hun-
garian gave a few interesting sidelights on gipsy
music; Lottie Richter carolled some of Schwartz’s
own lyrics, and Eric John supplied an artistic piano
accompaniment to the rhapsodies and negro spirituals
which the composer coaxed from his violin.
The Sick Children’s Hospital scored an improved
bank account from a jazz party which Mrs. Ted Theo-
dore arranged for the opening of the new Palais dp
Danse on the banks of the Brisbane River. Sir
Matthew- gave the place his benediction. It is a
pavilion without walls, and only one end is en-
closed. The breezes blew', flags flapped and paper
butterflies swung on ropes of greenery, and every-
body said it was just proper.
White frocks were the general wear on the hot
Sandgate Handicap day at Ascot, but Mrs. Stanley
Chapman broke the rule in a mimosa voile with
white broideries. Mrs. J. H. S. Barnes was in blue,
and Mrs. Muir favored king blue and yellow.
The Gordon Grahams’ one ewe lamb, Leith —one
of Brisbane’s beauties —has promised her hand to
J. C. O. Capper, son of the Cappers of Oakwal.
His Ex. went to the annual meeting of the Enog-
gera Boys’ Home. Canon Osborne and his wife w r ere
there, too, as well as De Witt Batty and many
others, reverend and otherwise; and afternoon tea
regaled them all.
Nancy Macnaughton, who was feted in Sydney on
her last appearance with “The O’Brien Girl,” is stay-
ing at Ascot wdth her papa, the Judge, until her
marriage early next year.
At the Women’s Club the other day Freda Bage
and S. Palmer, the hookworm specialist, urged the
members not to refrain from “swatting that fly” at
every opportunity. The lady illustrated her remarks
with special slides showdng the wicked ways of the
little winged pest w'e have always with us. She
blamed him (or it) for the prevalent gastritis,
though Palmer accused the Brisbane sewerage system
and plumped for borax spraying.
The Art Society and the Arts and Crafts folk have
had a good and w'ell-attended show at the Smith
Premier House. Sir Matthew looked in and Our Very
Best flocked in his wake.
Lyon Begbie and Roy Shaw —the captain with the
beautiful voice—have been to Toowoomba to fix up
preliminaries for a performance of “The Dust of the
Desert” there. Probably a special train will be
required to transport the show thither, with trucks
for frockings and scenery.
Pretty auburn-haired Mary Macgregor, daughter of
the ex-member for Merthyr, has vibrated the histrionic
divining rod of Oscar Asche and been offered an en-
gagement.
Guy Benson, for over 30 years with the Queensland
Trustees, has passed out. He was born in Melbourne
about 56 years ago, was educated in the Cold Country,
and pretty well all Brisbane knew and loved him.
He leaves a widow and a boy.
The Bennetts, of King’s College, are off to Sydney,
where the rev. pedagogue is to handle the reins at
Wesley College. Besides his wife he takes with
him a suitcase, kitbag and salad-bowl from the old
collegians of King’s, and a gold-mounted fountain-
pen from the present pupils, who also gave Mrs. Ben-
net a silver tray.
Letters from Japan tell of the marriage at Kobe
of pretty Yolande Garraway, of N. Queensland, to
Wedderburn Bisshop, of the Pacific Commercial Co.
there. It happened in the church of Seven Dolours,
Pere Page officiated, and J. B. Suttor (N.S.W.)
gave the bride away, while Marguerite Bell, of Rock-
hampton (Q.), was bridesmaid.

The vice-regal Forsters again struck a
patch of fleeting sunshine for their Medical
Congress lawn party. Her Ex. smiled her
welcomes under a brown-feathered hat-brim
and over brown upholsterings stitched lightly
with gold. Mrs Pitt Rivers wandered round
in Gyppo-patterned silk and a beribboned
fawn hat, while Lady Pat Blackwood looked
on in yellow, with black hat. The guests
filed from the sunbathed lawns to the ball-
room for the 4 o’clock refreshments where
primulas flowering in gold baskets gladdened
the food display and an orchestra made en-
trancing music. S’William Macewen was
with his son, who is accompanying him on
his travels; and there were enough degrees
on the lawns to fit out an American "col-
lege” for life.
The Stradbrokes entertained the Medical
Congress at an evening at-home on Thurs-
day. The event hopped off in real London
style at 9.30, after the Countess had fed a
detachment of 40 doctors’ wives at Stoning-
ton. Her Ex., in black, which glittered
goldenly from the under-swathings, received
the feminine contingent in the front hall
with her youngest daughter, Helena, who
stood in green silk, cheered with a gold
berths. The other Rous sister, Charlotte,
looking like a damask rose, was stationed in
the parlor. “Where on earth are the men?”
queried one bright little matron, affriglitedly
surveying the petticoated battalions. The
question was answered an hour later, when
his Ex., who had been dining with the medi-
coes, came in at the head of the missing male
division. A stringed orchestra made sweet
music (jazz discord is on the wane —thanks
be!) and, later, Walter Kirby sang a trio
of his best-liked ballads, to the accompani-
ment of Natalie Dawson. Supper was laid
out under masses of red roses, flanked by
lighted candles. A group of clerics and their
wives were mixed in with the meds., among
them the Dean of Melbourne, Archdeacon
Hindley and Toorak’s cheery vicar Law and
their other halves. The Mayoral Bruntons
were there, too, and Mrs: Undo Ferguson
and Mrs. Marshall McDonald —both these
last from M.L. Mrs. Cherry, a good-looker
from Adelaide, was encased in black and
silver; Mrs. Cooley (Sydney) livened black
chiffonery with a screening of glittery grey
beads; and Mrs. Humphery was becomingly
caparisoned in blue silk.
Federal Ministers did their bit for the
meds. with a garden party which surged
cheerfully on the lawns between showers and
under tents during the rainy spasms. Un-
luckily the party clashed with the big charity
matinee, but seemed none the less cheerful
for the collision. Apparently, none of the
male guests had defected, for seldom has one
seen such a well-manned afternoon frivol.
The wife of Acting-Priminister Earle Page
looked particularly nice in dove-like silken
embroiderings under a blue-flowered hat; the
Littleton Groom matron dressed becomingly
in pleated grey crepe de Chine which
blushed rosily to the sleeve-linings, and aloft
she had a black hat wreathed with white
feathers; and George Pearce’s wife was in
dark-blue marocain with a black lid. These
and their husbands, helped by Defence-Min-
iter Bowden, received the guests; and Dr.
Kenny, as lion. sec. of the Congress, effected
the introductions.
The women looking after the hospitality end
of the Medical' Congress included a cheery
“Tons of Money” theatre party in the pro-
gramme. The house was packed. The visi
tors were in platoons commanded by differ-
ent hostesses, and between acts the groups
played “general post” to exchange opinions
of the play. Lady Stradbroke. with the Phil-
limore damsel and gent.-help Keppel Palmer,
Avas penned on the right behind a presenta-
tion sheaf of red roses. It was one of the
most smartly-equipped audiences seen in any
playhouse since the war. The Ma State was
heavily represented, and Mrs. Earle Page
and Mrs. Littleton Groom added political
weight to the gathering.
The Victoria League staged its annual
Avelcome to inter-State visitors picturesquely
on the Botanical Garden lawns that slope
down to the Swan Lake. Tea was served on
little tables beneath gaily-colored umbrella
awnings. The G.-G. and Lady Forster were
anchored at the Wives and Mothers’
Friendly Union circus treat, but Lady Strad-
broke tore herself away early from Wirtlis’
tented attractions and came along with a
daughter and Miss Phillimore. Her Ex.
added to the colorful ensemble apricot satin
draperies with silk embroidery embellish-
ments and a brown ostrich-feathered hat.
Mrs. Harry Emmerton, caped and frocked
in brown with a flowery toque; the Allen
dame, in fawn under a floral roof; and Mrs.
Walker Sinclair, likewise brown-caped and
-hatted, lined up for the how-d’ye-doing by
the gravelled path. Mayoress Brunton, who
is now getting into her official stride, was
coated and skirted in mastic cloth with
oriental embroidery topped off with a plumed
hat of dark red. Hilda Grice, the acting
lion, sec., was Egyptian-patterned in silk
under a little red hat. The usually placid
old Gardens gee-gee that hauls the lawn-
mower was so overcome by the unexpected-
ness of the party or the soulfulness of the
orchestral music by the teahouse that he
absentmindedly overstepped his grassy beat
and flopped into the lake, and it took some
time to extract him. Dr. Charlie Lempriere’s
wife, who as a liuntswoman is an adept at
hauling horses from ditches, was among those
who sprinted to the rescue.
The Vic. Women’s Medical Society took
the whole of the Wattle Tea Room space
for, its welcome to its brother and sister Con-
gress members. The president and vice-
president, doctors Constance Ellis and Edith
Barrett, took the stair-head, both handsomely
set in black-jetted effects. It was a walk-
about, talk-about frivol of the most cheerful
description, with lots of room, lots of com-
fort in the shape of easy chairs, unlimited
food supply, and somewhere to smoke. One
squad of visitors defied the chillsome night
for a bird’s-eye view of the city from the
roof garden, but with teeth chattering they
beat a retreat after the barest glance. The
lady meds. were mostly black-frocked, but
Mrs. Fiaschi struck a brighter note in blue
satin hung with ivory lace. Another Sydney-
sider, Mrs. Chenhall, pleasingly patched her
inky chiffonery with maize. Mrs. Ted Fyffe
contributed a soft color note in glimmering
moonbeam draperies, and the Barrett dame
trailed black satin ingrained with red roses.
Of all the functions held in connection with
the Medical Congress none had more go in
it than the dinner of the Returned Sawbones
Assoc. Stanley Argyle, State Chief Sec., pre-
sided, aud saw to it that there were no heavy
speeches. He gave a lead in light, airy
and good-naturedly flippant talk, and the cue
was taken by others. One yarn re-
called how Dick Stawell, a front ranker, got
Ins first lesson in military discipline from a
Sydney med. —a South of Europe man —when
he and others of lesser calibre were strolling
in an unmilitary manner towards head-
quarters in the Island of Lemnos, and were
besought to “remember they were soldiers and
not sheep.” Springthorpe was accused of hav-
ing worn a uniform at Cairo that was so
puzzling that the G.O.C. couldn’t tell whether
he was a general or an admiral. But the
tormentors got as good as they gave, and
through it all Argyle looked delighted enough
to almost forgive the police for striking.
Mrs. N. Cruttenden, who has been pro-
ducer for the Dickens Society since it started,
has scribbled short stories and verse since
her schooldays, and has for years taken a
lively interest in dramatic work. She wrote
and produced the Dickens pageant which
won much favorable comment and dropped
a fat cheque into the Blind Appeal money-
box a couple
of years back.
Last year she
helped swell
the Limbless
and Tubercular
Soldiers’ Fund
with a success-
ful three-
nights’ per-
formance a t

self. During

pire, in which
a cast of tal-
ented kiddies
played in the different suburbs, thereby help-
ing to fill Billjim’s tobacco pouch and fur-
ther assisting other patriotic causes. The
lady's daughter, a talented pianist, is a
bright star in the Dickens orchestra.
A cheque for £l6OO will flutter into the
Queen Vic. Appeal cashbox as the result
of the “Pygmalion” matinee (all costs at-
tached to the production will be extracted
from the box-office receipts at the evening
performances). Souvenir-programme sellers,
headed by .Tosie Melville and Dorothy Brun-
ton, simply coined money, and a bevy of
Sassiety girl-brigands' piled up a few more
hundreds vending sweets and flowers—moun-
tains of both, mostly given by city florists
and lollyshop owners. Oddly enough the
applause was not so rapturous as might have
been expected—it seemed to exhaust itself
on the Boucicault-Vanbrugh recitations, two
efforts in which the pair touched high-water
mark.
Women who would otherwise have yawned
boredly through a Repertory show sprang to
attention at the intriguing sight of the
Governor-General’s daughter, in her coster-
l.vdy duds unpetticoating above the knee a
leg encased in a liole-riddled worsted stock-
ing to extract a shilling from the till in her
garter ; after which they enviously eyed the
ravishing creations in which she swished
across the stage in acts three, four and five.
As Eliza Doolittle Mrs. Pitt Rivers rams
home the feminine belief that “clothes make
the woman,” for, truth to tell, even her good
looks refused to stand the test of the flower-
girl's rags, although they took your breath
away when she blossomed out as an imita-
tion duchess. Her first creation of shimmer-
ing crepe colored like milked coffee swathed
her fine figure with a careless rapture, and
was moored at either hip with brown fur
centred with gold, while more fur weighted
the hanging sleeves. Her fair head was
thatched with a golden brown dazzle sub-
dued by a brown velvet side-attachment.
Then she appeared in a ball-gown of apricot
brocade, trailing a back hanging panel which
fell from a gold bodice anchored to the
shoulders with brilliants. She took her fifth
and final curtain frocked in white crepe
piped with green to match the jade of her
neckbeads, under a flimsy little coat hemmed
with colored embroidery and a green hat
sprouting a wide silver quill across the front-
age. The G.-G., Lady Forster and Lady
Pat Blackwood, who had all beamed appro-
val on the first night, came again for the
matinee performance. The Countess Strad-
broke, with daughter Helena and Miss Phil-
limore, applauded from the opposite pen.
This is a Lafayette photo of the wife of
James Barrett, the medical knight, and one
of Melbourne’s most accomplished matrons.
She is a gifted
artist, and at
one time was
looked upon as
among the
most promis-
ing pupils at
the National
Gallery; but
for many years
she hid her
talent under a
bu s h el, in
order that she
might devote
herself to the
care of her
young family.
However, now
that they have
grown up, she
has resurrected
her .neglected
paint-box, and
a few canvases
that she has lately turned out are eloquent
evidence that her hand has not lost its cun-
ning nor her eye its perception of color
values.
Do vice-regal folk ever think of them-
selves as being quite ordinarily human?
One somehow thought of royalty when
the Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers was return-
ing thanks to the audience on the first
night of “Pygmalion” at Her Majesty’s. She
thanked everybody in the orthodox theatrical
style, concluding with a mention of “My com-
pany, if I may call them so.” The Honor-
able matron, with her Excellency parents in
the box of honor, doubtless felt rather like a
regular queen who speaks of the community
at large as “my people.”
All the vice-regals, down to the third gen-
eration —the G.-G.’s with their little grand-
children. and the Stradbrokes with the more
matured of their available next-of-kin —paid
Wirths’ a visit the other afternoon, when the
Union of Soldiers and Sailors’ Wives and
Mothers came for their annual circus dissi-
pation. Olympia was crowded, of course,
and the crumbs of 5000 buns, moistened by
ice-creams, remained in the building to tell
the tale. Strange to say, the Forsters
atoned for certain late arrivals at theatres by
being too soon for the circus. Owing to a
misunderstanding his Ex. and party got there
at 2 for a performance which wouldn’t begin
before 2.30. George Wirth. wondering what
to do with a premature Gov.-General, be-
thought him of the new baby elephant, and
took them all round to the reserve, where the
infant is being taught to say its elephantine
prayers at mother’s knee. So everybody was
amused, even before the feats in the arena
began to tickle the vice-regal party. They
all loved the circus. Lord Forster laughed
till he cried at a midget equestrian who is
the funniest of sights. Because the agile
little chap is billed as a Prince the represen-
tative of royalty thought it incumbent on him
to laugh the louder, perhaps. And the clowns !
A man in motley who catches far-flung
potatoes on a fork audaciously pitched a
pomme-de-terre to the vice-regal box. Then
did the famous old cricketer in Forster assert
himself. He witched the audience by catch-
ing the uncooked eatable in his left hand,
and returning it hotly (still with his left)
to the pierrot. It came not quicker than the
recipient’s thought. The aim was true, and
the courtly clown adroitly caught it on his
brow instead of impaling it on the fork.
At Essendon St. John’s Marjorie Moun-
tain, one of our tennis cracks, agreed to
partner Janie;-' Todd for life in the bigger
game of matrimony, and did it in gold and
cream brocade, with orange-blossoms anchor-
ing her tulle veil and outlining a lengthy
back wash of gold-patterned tissue. A
bouquet of water-lilies gleamed whitely in
her hand. Doris Mountain and Hilda Todd,
sisters of the contracting pair, were helped by
Jean Showers in the bridesmaiding, the first
in white and gold embroidery, the second in
pink, the third in green, and all three topped
by headache bands and listening-in posies.
The bride’s parents, the W. J. Mountains,
staged the after-jollo in the Moonee Ponds
Town Hall.
The Mermaid Repertories were right up
against trouble with their final production
of the season, “The Romantic Lady.” After
being heavily butted by the Sydney Reps,
and losing their projected first night in the
encounter, they had the bad luck to strike a
rainy snap. Luckily Saturday’s downpour
failed to wash back the loyalists who really
like a good play for its own sake, and these
filled the Playhouse quite nicely. Though
Lady Stradbroke is understood to think that
Melbourne rather neglects its culture, she
was an absentee, but Lady Forster with Mrs.
Pitt Rivers and a party were interested spec-
tators from the front row of the balcony.
The Playhouse has no vice-regal pen to shut
vice-royalty off from the playgoer-in-ordi-
nary, and adjacent to the Forster presence
were a flapper and her “boy” who. devoted
more time to chocolates and spooning than
to the performance. The coldly-astonished
gaze of the blue-lapelled gent.-help might
have chilled the edges of their food and love
appetites had they noticed it; but they were
far too busy.
The Brighton-road Flemings have just
said “Bless you, children,” to their pretty
youngest daughter Audrey and General
Charles Rosenthal's son, who is a loot, in
our own Navee.
Mrs. S. Alison, who crossed from Sydney
for the Cup, and is sheltering at Menzies’,
cheered up the strike-dulled social atmo-
sphere with a little dinner for a bevy of the
Very Best a few nights ago; and after the
coffee she convoyed her party to Bibron’s
daifce-hall for a final jazz. In her group
were Lady Pat Blackwood, the Alfred Turn-
bull and Julian Mackay matrons, Kathleen
Osborne and a trio of gent.-helps. Later in
the evening a thrill stirred the well-
populated arena when Lady Stradbroke, who
had evidently contracted strike-fever and
downed her vice-regal responsibilities for the
giddy occasion, blew in with daughter
Helena, Hester Phillimore and Keppel
Palmer.
Crowe, who is the State’s supervisor of
the frozen lamb and other exports, is getting
a trip out of the Wembley Park show. He
leaves on Nov. 27, and will be in charge
of the refrigerating and agricultural ex-
hibits from Australia. A deputy-superin-
tendent, who is afterwards to become his
understudy, is to be appointed soon. If
Alec Peacock is not keen on going as Vic.'s
envoy to the exhibition, Pennington, M.L.A.,
ex-Whip, may get the mission and the cash
to finance it.
A line or two from Adelaide: —
The Anzac Hostel struck an ideal day for its
annual garden party, and there was a record muster. The
show is run by the Red Cross Hospital Handicrafts Sec-
tion, and its purpose is to sell the work of disabled
soldiers. This section began modestly, but is one
of the most useful and progressive of Red Cross
departments now, and what the little shop off
Run die-street has meant to disabled men who find
that, after all, they can still turn their hands to
something, only the men themselves know.
Photographs have come of the Belgian model
village, near Lierre, that has been partly built
with S. Australian money. When America took
charge of relief work in Belgium the local fund
had still plenty of money, and at Lady Galway’s
suggestion £35,000 was handed over for rebuild-
ing homes in the devastated areas. She crossed to
Belgyim herself, got in touch with the Belgian
authorities, roped in Agent-General Lucas and ex-
Agent-General Fred Young to help her in England,
and the result is a “Sud Australie” in Belgium
made up of delightful homes that many would give
their eyes for here.
Kitty Wright was entertained at the Wentworth
by some of her intimates the other afternoon, with
Joan and Judy Whitby as hostesses, the occasion
having something to do with her approaching mar-
riage with Geoff Morey.
Another wedding was staged in the St. Peter’s
College chapel a couple of days before —that of
tire elder daughter of the late Archdeacon Horna-
brook to Arnold Van Senden.
His Ex., who is something of an artist himself,
said the opening word at the Society of Arts Federal
Exhibition, and unwound some special commendation
for the “originality and promise” of Australian art
and its freedom from the “freakish development
that had been going on for the last 10 or 12 years
in Europe.”
Lady Bridges was at the Victoria Hall for the show
staged by Miss Leitch and her pupils in aid of the;
Consumptive Home. An attractive little show, with
folk and country dances as the star items of the
programme.

Comique, the elder brother of luckless Ivins
Carnival, brought comfort at last to his faithful
punters by winning the Armadale Cup at Caulfield.
The Comedy King horse ran second in the V.A.T.C.
Ccongy Handicap and fourth in both Melbourne
Stakes and Cup, but his failure in the Williamstown
Cup, when the beans were staked, put a lot cf
people off him for the consolation race last Satur-
day. He won handsomely, doing the 12 furlongs in
2mm. 33sec. Wynette, in running second with
Sst. 91b. (Happv Queen was third, and behind her
were Harvest King, Stare, Sir Andrew, Polynesian
and Princess Mernda), showed that Easingwold, in
tiying to give her lumps of weight for the Caulfield
Cup, was up against as tough a proposition as
Rivoli was when he chased Bitalli at Flemington.
.Tackstaff, following up his victory over hurdles at
Fiemington with a quite brilliant performance at.
Caulfield, recompensed his people for their disap
pointment at National time. The Sea Prince gelding
happened to be on the decline in July when he was
most wanted, and his burliness to-day, in comparison
with his conspicuous lack of beef in midwinter, is
a warning against over-training. Talking of'jumpers,
Fleetstone, having won four steeplechases off the
reel, must be ready- for a rest. Anyway, half' a
dozen wins should suffice for . Mr. Claude Grice s
six-vear-okl before the beginning of next winter
campaign.
On paper, All Serene was a good thing for the
six-furlong sprint, and 4 to 1 was a decent price for
the winner to start at. All Serene is a 4-year-old
daughter of All Black, and 7st. 121 b. looked an east-
job for her, seeing that she ran third to Sunburst
and Easingwold in the Newmarket. Little Simmons
brought her on the outside with a rattle. Time
lmin. 13see. Evidently the stuff that Newmarket
winners are made of.
* * * *
“Fax" : But for striking bad luck in the
early part of the race, Lady Valais would probably
have won the A.J.C. Derby.* Wynette’s great finishes
in the Williamstown and Armadale Cups support
“O.K.’s” theory (B. l/11/’23) that she would have
been a good thing for the Melbourne Cup with 7st.
121 b., penalty included, and she would hardly have
got any more. As it was the S.A. mare accounted for
the Caulfield and Williamstown Cups ; Princess Mernda
took the Moonee Valley Cup and Frances Tressadv _ the
Derby. If the sex acts up to its best traditions
when autumn comes with its Newmarket, Australian
Cup, Doncaster and Sydney Cup, this will be a
wonderful year for mares. Meanwhile, many snares
are being laid for punters in the form of suggestions
that stallions which ran only moderately at the
recent Melbourne meetings may be expected to do
better in the autumn. After all, there is not much
hope of considerable improvement, even for the Eng-
lish horses, such as Bnckwood. Fred Power, who car-
ried more superfluous beef, may be racing into form,
but Backwood gave no hint of excellence, strange to
stay, nor was so good a judge as Sol Green deeply
impressed by the two wins of Our Prince. How-
ever, after allowing the imported horse to be an-
nounced for sale at auction, Green was persuaded
to keep it a while longer.
“F.A.”: The old trick of blocking the
telegraph lines with “urgent" messages to prevent
news of a starting-price commission reaching the
course was revived recently by a Sydney crowd
operating on a down-the-line meeting. And it would
have come off if a bookmaker, who expected a wire
from his shop at Newcastle, hadn’t sent his clerk
to the telegraph office to inquire about it. The
clerk overheard a conversation in the office relative
to the number of urgent wires addressed to one man.
Recognising' the recipient, he rushed back to the
boss, and soon the price came down half a score
of points. The good thing won, but its party
spent quite a time trying to find out who had
wrecked the market.
Asked how lie had lured at the, Canter-
bury Park (N.S.W.) meeting on Saturday, McShort-
odds magnanimously admitted that he was a “shade
ahead of it." Four of the eight winners went out at
20 to I—which1 —which means .that there wasn’t a shilling
for them —another at 12’s, two more at 10’s, and the
eighth at 0 to 4 on. And, as likely as not, the
punter who tried to get £5 to £4 on that favorite
(F. G. Spurway’s Tingle, by Three —Posket) had to
abandon the quest as fruitless after a dozen attempts.
Xot only did punters get nothing back in four races
(a thing which never happens where there is a
straight-out tote), but three of the four horses placed
second to the “skinners” would themselves have been
“skinners” had positions been reversed. Moreover,
the bookmakers who bet on doubles and trebles only
never had to pnv out once. The titbit of the racing
was Jack Marsh's finishing run in the Flying Handi-
cap—he got up just in time, after having been many
lengths behind the leaders at the turn. Jack is a
pocket edition of his sire, Son of the Marsh. Though
a 14.2 pony and a nine-year-old stallion at that, he
can travel six furlongs with the speediest plater in
the land.
* * ■* *
“Fax”: The inquiry into pony-racing in
Sydney will at least serve to remind critics in all
the States that the prevalence of pony-racing is a
disgrace to any Government which sanctions its
existence. That ii has never been a canker in Eng-
land, the birthplace of the thoroughbred racer, is
presumably a credit to public opinion there as com-
pared with its lazy counterpart in Australia. “Ponies”
are fraudulent in their nomenclature, to begin with.
They are undersized thoroughbreds. Instead of improv-
tng the breed of horses “the meetin’s” create illegiti-
mate gambling machines, and foster new growths of
blackguardism. Pony-racing is politically an ugly
excrescence. Tt has always had the support of Labor
members who should have been its bitterest oppo-
nents. An honest Government would suppress
pony-racing in the interests of the poorer classes,
even as John Wren's scandalous Collingwood tote in
Melbourne was eventually suppressed. When the
V.R.C. committee, having refused Wren’s horse nomi-
nations of old, asked Soapy Jack to justify his unlaw-
ful means of draining the resources of a working-
man’s district- —to explain, in short, what he meant
by his claim that ho supplied a boon to the workers
-he replied, “I give them hope.” That is what
pony meetings do for their victims whilst bringing
grist to the mills of those who live on the game.
They supply the Pleasures of Hope to optimists who
are, in a trite way of speaking, “going to the Devil.”
* -* * *
“FY7” : “The Deacon,” preaching on the
text of “stopping” racehorses (B 15/11/’23), recalls
a yarn told by that great old-time jockey, the late
“Bricky” Colley. He was riding a hot favorite at
Rockhampton (Q-), the bridle of his mount being-
bitted with one of the ancient bits with long side
bars. In the jostle for the rails at the turn into
the straight, a rival's whip “keeper” accidentally
slipped over the bar of Colley’s bit. “What’s it
worth to take her off, Brick?” said the other fellow.
“Half what I’m on,” replied Colley through his
teeth. Gently slipping the loop off the bar, the
opportunist dropped back. A hard jerk of the whip
would, of course, have settled “Bricky’s” chance.
* # • •
Last May, during the Adelaide Cup meet-
ing, the stipendiary stewards prevented a mare,
Powder and Patches, from running, and later held
an inquiry into the possible doping of her. After
they had decided to drop the matter, the owner
brought an action against S.A. .Jockey Club for
slander. It has now been settled out of court.
Sporting pressmen with a natural anxiety for the
terms of the settlement were informed merely that
one of them was that they should not be made public.

“0.K.”: A Victorian race-meeting more
worthy of free boost than any event on the turf
calendar is the annual gathering in aid of the
V.R.C. Benevolent Fund, which reaches far within
its own field of charity. Hospital benefit meetings
CLIVE LEONARD,
chairman of
the V.A.T.C.
are open, like bazaars
and things, to . the
objection ' that they
encourage the Govern-
ment to avoid fair-
play in taxation, out
the V.R.C. Benevolent
Fund is purely turfy
in it-s bearings, and
only the racing world
is called upon to assist
it. The benefit race-
meeting is dated for
Saturday week (Dee.
1) at Moonee Valley,
and most of the people
most interested in
local gee-gee gambles
will help make it a
financial success. If
the weather chooses to
remain unsympathetic
nothing too bad can
be said about that old
offender.
Melbourne’s unseasonable damp practically
ruined the programme for the inter-State tennis
tournament, but, rain or shine, the result would have
been the same as far as the Vie.-N.S.W. engagement
was concerned. Lacking Anderson, the Ma Staters
never had a hope. The brightest patch in Friday’s
play was Plomley’s defeat of Mclnnes, whilst the
Willard brothers showed good form in both singles
and doubles. J. Willard played pluckily against
Hawkes, and, after dropping one set to Wertheim,
A. AVillard finished off his towering opponent in
first-class style. The brethren provided a purple
patch in the murky proceedings of Saturday by com-
pelling Patterson and Hawkes to fight for their lives
in the second set of their doubles encounter. The
fine stroking of the internationals gave them a run-
away advantage in the first chapter, and it looked
as if the Ma Staters would succumb early in the
second set; but with 5—2 registered against them,
they stiffened their attack and took three games in
a string. A. Willard’s strong service gave him
several outright aces against both Hawkes and Pat-
terson, and the way these comparative novices
scooped the ball out of the rallies to break up the
defence with well-placed tosses suggests that they
have no ordinary career before them. They took the
second session to 11—9 before the experienced enemy
got the upper hand. Peach, the N.S.W. captain,
found his crisp driving insufficient to overcome
O’Hara Wood, who rioted brilliantly on the net and
produced some of the prize-takers from his gallery
of volleys.
“15-30” : The surprise of the Vic.-N. S.
Wales tennis series was the defeat of Mclnnes,, the
Davis Cup colt, by Dr. Plomley of Sydney. Mclnnes
had a 3—o lead in the first set, and worked up to
6—5 in the second spasm, but Plomley, a hard-
plugging player, unimpressed by the calibre of his
opponent, fairly worried him out of the victory
in each ease. As far as technique goes, Plomley is
inferior to Mclnnes, but he is a great fighter and
was astute enough to exploit the youngster’s over-
confidence, dreadfully enlarged by his recent
trip, and shatter his morale by forcing him into
errors. Plomley’s well-deserved win should warn
Mclnnes of the danger of sacrificing accuracy to
severity in an endeavor to score mechanically by
outright winners. He has a long way to go be-
fore he achieves the uncanny dexterity of Tilden
and Johnston.

“Bimble" : J. O. Anderson (B. 15/ll/ f 23)
represents a type that is rare in first-class tennis. It
is not the thing for a racquet-spinner to develop a
hungry professional soul, hence the haste of Ander-
GOLF FOR BEGINNERS—THE BOGEY
MATCH.
son’s late colleagues in the Davis Cup team to dis-
sociate themselves from his sentiments. They
politely mentioned that they were well looked after
in the matter of expenses, but as they are all un-
married and had no business to neglect during their
absence abroad, their position is different from that
of Anderson. It is plain, however, that the Austra-
lian Lawn Tennis Association will have to come to
some fixed arrangement for the remuneration of
players who are sent in pursuit of the Davis Cup. The
Association can’t go on making special allowances
to some artist in the game whose racquet may he
needed to help the gate, though it has already estab-
lished so many precedents in the matter —the payment
of exes, for Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Patterson in 1922;
is a case in point—that it will have a struggle to get
back to the comparative parsimony of Brookes’* time.
The root trouble, of course, is in deciding how far
a man can he paid without making him a pro. This
difficulty hadn’t presented itself in the days of
Brookes and Dunlop, whose private incomes made
them practically indifferent to the financial side of
the enterprise, but, with the advent of the Anderson
type of player, who reckons that he_ should be recom-
pensed for his loss of time, in addition to his hotel
and travelling bills, the problem becomes ticklish
indeed. v
“Wilfrido”: Great is the spread of tennis
in the Windy Isles. Membership of the M.L. Tennis
Association jumped from 10,584 in 1914 to 18,045
this vear. In Wellington the number went from
1654 to 3068, and there are soon to be 75 municipal
courts. Enthusiasm for the game, however, does not
appear to be producing another Wilding. There is
a saddening lack of coaches and of players like
Anderson and O’Hara Wood to practise with.

Since Eddie Butcher came east from Ival-
goorlie he has walloped several Australians, a Eura-
sian, a Russian, a Hungarian Jew and a Belgian. Con-
tinuing his ethnological studies the ardent youth
took on Flores, the Filipino, at Sydney Stadium,
and gave him a joyous hiding for 11 'rounds. Then
the Manilaman discovered that he had hurt his right
hand, or some other vulnerable part of his anatomy,
and in went the towel. Maeario Villon made an equally
shattering discovery in the 11th round of his Mel-
bourne fio-ht with Spargo. In that case, the Filipino
morale was so grievously damaged—or it may have
been the stomach—that 10 seconds were counted bv
a phlegmatic referee over 1281 b. of inert brown meat.
\ bleak time is in store for these Filipino pugs now
that the Australian thumper has unmasked their
dreadful secret, which is that they can’t stand body
punishment.

So fid y, the Queensland boxer, who was
carried away unconscious after a fight with Eddie
Lvnagh. died in hospital nine days after the knock-
out ” Thus, within seven days two Australian lads
were fatally injured in Stadium rings—Jack Dnnstan,
at Melbourne, on October 27; Frank Soady, at Bris-
bane on November 3.. In each case the insensibility
which issued in death was produced by a blow (or
blows) administered, i<; circumstances of sickening
brutality, to a beaten boy—Dnnstan, .according. v<
the Aue report, was heard to say, ‘Tin done 1 a
round before he received the finishing punch; sandy,
in the Courier's words, was “leaning against the
ropes in a dazed condition, unable to protect him-
self” when he was battered into oblivion. Vet no
arrests have been made in either city. Neither has
anything been published as to whether the depen-
dants of the victims are to be compensated by the
Stadium proprietaries, one of which, at least, is a
highly profitable concern. '
There was £llBO in the house when
Tommy Uren met Archie Bradley at Sydney Stadium.
Better fights have been seen in a bar-room for the
price of a pot. Move of a wrestler than a fighter,
Archibald broke the monotony of the sixth spasm
hv trying to throw Uren among the Press seats,
lu the next round he floored Tommy with a perfectly
fair eatch-as-catch-can grip, but the referee disallowed
the fall. Uren the winner on points.

“Past Grammar”: The Tailteann games,
which were to have been held in Dublin last year
but were abandoned owing to the counter-attraction
of a Republican rising, are, De Valera permitting, to
take place next August. In addition to the usual
Olympic track events, there are to be contests in
boxing, handball, rowing, swimming, golf, tennis,
billiards, gymnastics, motor-cycling, automobile racing,
yachting, hurling, football, rounders and camogie
whatever that may be. Why two-up is omitted the
writer is unable to understand. He has always
cherished a theory that the mysterious round towers
of Erin were erected as lookouts for kernes “keep-
ing nit” on the insidious John Hop in the interests
of Sunday “schools.”
“Percy Pawnticket”: Sailing men still
talk about an exploit of just-dead Alf (“The Widow”)
O’Brien. There was an old craft rotting in the sands
near his camp at Botany. This he disinterred, patched
up and entered for a Botany sailing handicap, re-
gardless of the jests heaved at his resurrected ark
by the local fishermen, a sportive and hard-shelled
breed. “Couldn’t beat a canal barge,” said the
hunters of snapper and flathead. But the joke was
with “The Widow” when, at the tiller of a leaky
tub, manned mainly by chaps who were expert
musicians but very raw boatmen, he got away
with first prize.
Easily the finest innings played in Sydney
this season was Johnny Taylor’s 253 for ’Varsity
against Waverley, last year’s premiers.
The A.I.F. and Australian XI batsman
made his runs in 233 minutes. Three
shots went over the pickets and 35 10
the boundary. With J. V. Garner (111)
Taylor put on 291 for the third wicket,
and Uni. wound up with 4 for 434, which
ought to be a winning score. Johnny
struck a bad patch in Australia last
season, but as a member of Armstrong’s
team he got 1116 runs, averaging 30.16.
One of the few stylists among contempo-
rary N.S.W. batsmen (others are Macart-
ney, Andrews and Kippax) he never pails
on the spectator like the Bardsleys and
Kelleways.
* X-
“Snow”: I.n a recent Tasmanian
match E. Spurway, batting for Dundas,
scored 121 n.o. in 25 minutes. The runs
were belted off six overs, and included
10 sixers and 11 fours. A brisk per-
forma nee, but not so slick as Victor Trumper’s 50
in 4i minutes (two overs) for Paddington against
Waverley in 1907.
* * * *
The results, of the first few club-cricket
matches in the Adelaide season leave the top of the
list occupied by two new teams. Kensington is a
district carved out of East Torrens, and has three
inter-State men, Bowley, Rymill and Stirling, as a
nucleus. The Colts are an experiment of the Cricket
Association,' which, disregarding the District system
for the moment, has gathered together a dozen of the
most promising youngsters, with the veteran Arthur
Richardson as captain and coach, in the hope of
finding something to stiffen the lately ineffectual
State XI.
* * * *
“Past Grammar”: The greedy and impu-
dent Sydney Rugby League has put in a claim for
the. use of the Show Ground for its professional
exhibitions. Instead of incontinently replying that
tlie Show Ground was reserved for amateur sport,
the R.A.S. committee is weakly parleying with the
professional organisation to the end that the League
may come in along- with the amateur bodies. The
League doesn’t really need the Show Ground. It
has already acquired a winter monopoly over the
Sports Ground and the Cricket Ground, although the
latter was dedicated to amateur sport. If it gets
control of the R.A.S. enclosure, the three principal
playing fields of Sydney will be given over to
professional football, a situation without parallel in
any other part of the world. And in one of its
aspects the League code is hardly more
elevating than pony-racing. Betting, with all
its unlovely concomitants, is heavy, especially
among the youngsters of the junior clubs. Those
who can remember the rise and fall of professional
l’oot-running predict that professional football will
go the same way. But there is no necessity for
public bodies of the character of the R.A.S. to
help it along the primrose path.

“Riverina”: Having started the Bluff
(M.L.). oyster-eating controversy, I want to correct
“F.A.” (B. 18/10/’23), who awards the palm to
Rangi Thomas. The record is 27doz. A local man,
Charlie Bradshaw, surrounded them. Dalubt is
locally east on an alleged feast of 33doz. by Fred
Aarons, an old-time N.S.W. footballer, although it
is marked up on the wall of Wally Newman’s fish-
shop. Fred, by the way, introduced the tango to
M.L., but a fine war record entitles him to forgiveness
for that.
“Wink” : I did not make the absurd claim
that Weber was the greatest wrestler in the world
(“Barb,” B. 27/9/’23), but merely suggested, by
taking a line through Buttan Singh’s success among
the European middleweights, that Clarence was the
greatest at Ms weight. Oddly enough, I was at
Koroit (Vic.) when Gunga Brahm, mentioned by
“8.,” died, and from afar off witnessed the cre-
mation. If the respect of his fellow-Indians could
be gauged by the size of his funeral pyre, Brahm
was a man of great standing amiong them. Tt was
an enormous bonfire. I looked at it without envy,
however, for doubtless I shall win to a greater.

IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS
Dodge Brothers have not simply
brought out a complete new line
of motor cars. They have done
something infinitely wiser and
better than that.
They have brought new beauty,
new riding ease and new mechani-
cal perfection to the product on
which their reputation as builders
has been founded.
The same sturdy engine is under
the hood; the same dependable
chassis, improved in numberless
details, underlies the body.
But the rear springs—now under-
slung—have been materially
lengthened. The wheelbase, too,
is longer, and the combined result
is a notable improvement in rid-
ing qualities.
Bodies of all types have been de-
signed to give improved appear-
ance and greater comfort. Lower,
longer, with deeper seats and
more leg room, the lines of these
new cars are low-swung and
graceful—the interiors are com-
fortable and roomy.
New head lamps and fenders,
especially designed by Dodge
Brothers to conform with the
general lines of the car —a long,
straight hood and cowl effect—
longer and wider running boards
—unusually wide doors —-com-
bination stop signal and tail
lamp—and instruments attrac-
tively grouped on raised panel—
are a few of the numerous body
innovations common to all types.

THE INKY WAY.
Dead in Adelaide, at 53, journalist W. 0. Caldcr.
He learned his business on the Register, and stayed
in that office till the State Hansard staff was formed
in 1914. He joined it at once and remained with it
to the end.
“Patrick”: North Canterbury (M.L.) has one of
the queerest newspapers in the world. A severe
earthquake shook the plant many years ago, and from
that date the paper has been set with wobbly columns
and slanting' lines.
“Macann”: One war magazine was published of
which no one lias a copy. The Nizam Bulletin
appeared on the transport Nizam just prior to the
landing'. There was no press nor even a typewriter
on that wretched vessel, so the editor —now running
a bi-weekly paper at Casino (N.S.W.) —insisted on
all MS. being neatly written. As contributions were
received they were pasted on a square post on the
mess-deck, each issue being pasted over the previous
day’s. The “paste” was a well-known brand of fig-
jam.
The November issue of Vision has for contributors
Norman Lindsay, Hugh McCrae, Duleie Deamer,
Andrew MaeCunn (who writes on “Melophobia”) and
Les Robinson, in addition to the editors. A wicked
trifle entitled “Shame” is alleg'ed to he by “Janies
Flack,” though only one man in Australia could
have written it, and his name is neither Janies nor
Flack. In this number appears the first instalment
of an Anglicised version of Casanova’s “Memoirs”—
an attraction which, at the present rate of about
COO words per quarter, should still be going strong
when Jack Lindsay and Kenneth Slessor are approach-
ing' their nineties.
“D.F.”: Harry Manderson has turned the pen
that lie once pushed for the Melbourne Age into a
boring plant, and is after oil. He blew into Sydney
the other day from Timor, Australia’s nearest neigh-
bor on the north-west, on his way to Lisbon to
make sure of big oil concessions in the Portuguese
half of that benighted island. If he has any spare
time he may pick up something about the early
Portuguese exploration of the Australian coast. Over
at Deli, in Timor, they still fire off sometimes what
is alleged to be one of the guns that Vasco Da Gama
brought on the first voyage round the Cape of
Good Hope to India.
“Hamhone”: At a salary approaching four figures
J. W. Robinson is deserting the Inky Way 10
exploit the ether with Farmer’s (Sydney) broad-
casting- service. From the clerical side of the g.
M. Heiiai.ii he graduated to the literary staff; then,
after an interval at the war, he put in a couple
of years managing the old sheet’s Newcastle office
Latterly he has been doing his hit on the Herald’s
Tame Cat page. He is a member of the Institute
of Radio Telegraphists, owns one of the best experi-
menting stations in Australia, is one of the four
hon. radio inspectors for the Ma State and is still
only 27 ■ years old.
“Mendelian”: New Australia Lane’s one-time
literary lieutenant, Charlie Seymour, is nowadays a
sick man in Brisbane. A Dubliner who had sailed
the seven seas before he struck Bananaland, he was
sub-editor when Lane launched the Brisbane
Worker, about 33 years ago. lie was more —when
at the outset there was a trade boycott of the paper
Seymour put a bag on liis hack and went forth to
sell the issue. In after days he was recalled to the
chair when 11. E. Boote transferred to the Sydney
sheet, and he edited it till a couple of years ago. At
present, despite ill-health, he manages to edit the
Journal of the State Insurance office.
“G.R.”: London’s Pall Mall Gazette has been
absorbed after an independent existence of t>B jeais.
Few papers have had abler conductors or more
brilliant contributors; Lord Movley, Lord Munc-r,
Sir E. T. Cook, Henrv Cockayne Oust and, finally,
W. T. Stead were among those who handled the
editorial reins in nvgone years. Its news service
was brilliant too; few papers have ever had a bigger
scoop than the “P.M.G’s.” announcement of Glad-
stone’s impending retirement in 1894. But. it has
fallen back during the present century, and now it
has been merged in the Evening Standard. Hid.'
three London evening papers are left: the oews.
the. Standard and the Star.
“Jack-Shay”: As to where The Bulletin pushes
its red nose. A few months ago I got back into
the old paper after nearly 10 years silence.
Results soon began to accrue. The tn'd
letter came from Papua and started off “Dear Jack,
I thought you were dead, not having heard from
you,” etc. To date 27 letters have arrived, the buik
from different parts of Australia, but others from
Paris, Scotland, New York, South Africa, Yokohama,
Maoriland and Matt a Grosso, South America. I am
thinking of giving the spirit-raisers a call to see
if any messages are awaiting me from the other
place, where a lot of my correspondents thought 1
had gone, and where I am sure the red cover must
manage to get.
“Randolph Rentless”: The Melbourne Cup provides
material for a brisk annual exchange of compliments
between Sydney Sun and Evening News : and this
year the sparring was more vicious than ever, lne
Sun began the barney by announcing that it was
out with the result of the race at 3.41 ; whereupon
the News claimed to have been on the streets at 3.40
The next day the Sun published a reproduction of
its loathsome rival’s S'top Press column to show
that if the latter had got ahead of it by a secono
it had only done so by leaving out the betting
quotations. At the .same time it refused to believe
that the News had been in front, because it (the
Sun) had stationed a reporter in front of the News
office, and he had bought “the first copy brought ouc
of the office”-at 3.42-1 p.m. No principals have been
killed yet; but seconds continue to be split and
quartered.
“Bunchytop": To the pressman raw from the
country, city journalism is fraught with many sur-
prises, none so striking as the disregard for truth
in descriptive reports. Facts are frequently ignored
in a striving for effect, and even passages quoted
as verbatim reports of meetings are often added to
or twisted to produce an allegedly humorous or
impressive effect. Without hesitation the damage
to be caused by a fire is assessed within five minutes
of the outbreak, if an edition has to be caught.
The lives of firemen, police and others are thrown
into imagined dangers; stock which doesn’t exist
i. damaged; what might have happened is written
as having happened. In fairness to these nonchalant
liars and distorters, it may be said that they are
seldom actuated by any other spirit than the effort
to make a good news story of everything. But
there is an unpleasant odor of deliberate deception
about this sort of journalism, which is wholly absent
from the country press.

“The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,” as played
at Melbourne King’s last Saturday, rather
failed to account for its notoriety of 30 years
ago. At the outset Pinero’s play took a last-
century stamp from the long account of Tan-
queray’s unfortunate first marriage, delivered
by Cayley Drummle to two friends of their
absent host. The monologue, owing perhaps
to the nervousness of Dion Boucicault, had
all the sound of labored smart-writing re-
cited by an actor who held the middle of
the stage for that purpose. Subsequently the
play seemed to excuse its theatrical form by
interesting and forcible action. Hut a wire-
drawn discussion about Past and Future
could not keep the house from coughing.
This was when Tanqueray and Paula were
badly wounded by the discovery that “Saint”
Ellean’s sweetheart is one of the fellows
who helped spoil Mrs. Tanqueray, in all
senses of the word, before she found the opti-
mist anxious to marry her. Irene Vanbrugh
was distinctly too slow and not loud enough
in her gloomy spoken reflections. She might,
however, have felt depressed by the know-
ledge that Hugh Ardaile’s impersonator
(Martin Walker) had been a failure in his
altercation with her after Ellean left them
together. The young man lacked weight,
dignity, “charm of mannah,” to account for
his having attracted both Paula and Ellean
in their turns. To a lesser degree the play
suffered from a comparatively weak pair of
Orreyds. Joan Crossley, as the ex-courtesan
who had married a lord, was too pronounced
a vulgarian, while Pirie Bush, as the titled
tippler, made a poor, red-nosed caricature
of the character. Also Mrs. Gortelyon (Lena
Halliday) was but a suggestion of the more
expansive Alice Cortelyons whom Melbourne
knew long ago. Nor did Janet Eccles for
a moment realise one’s conception of Ellean,
the tepid maiden who is the cause, direct
and indirect, of stepmother’s neurotic ex-
plosions. Still, Miss Eccles has natural
uualifications for presenting the type of
Ellean one expects to turn up from the con-
vent. Dion Boucicault’s present amiable
Cayley Drummle shows wonderfully little
difference from the Cayley affectionately re-
membered by many Melbourne folk, and praise
for C. M. Hallard’s performance of Aubrey
Tanqueray need go no further than the
remark that he makes the worried husband,
as he had made the ill-fated widower in the
first act, a more lovable man, though not a
more important person, than the late George
“THE WEARING OF THE GREEN” AT
MELBOURNE PRINCESS’S.
Allen Doone and some of his fellow-conspira-
tors in Irish drama.
Titheradge did. What Irene Vanbrugh did
with the powerful name-part was consider-
ably less, no doubt, than she will do with it
a week later. Last Saturday was her first
time of actually playing Mrs. Tanqueray, it
was said. She had known the lines and the
business for years, but not from her own
g age experience. All the same, after playing it
1000 times the gifted artist could not be
other than a “hard” Paula Tanqueray. Mak-
ing the woman outrageously offensive in her
attitude to Mrs. Gortelyon, and almost a
virago, rather than an overwrought product
of unwholesome circumstances in her out-
breaks of temper, she wins no sympathy for
Paula. The sympathy all goes to Tanqueray.
Melbourne’s Mermaid Society saw the last
of Mrs. Apperly, for the present, in one of
the happiest amateur productions the Play-
house has ever had. “The Romantic Young
Lady,” staged on Friday and Saturday, is a
fragile comedy from the Spanish of Martinez
Sierra, which charms by its fresh setting
of conventional characters in stereotyped
surroundings. The traditional bachelor novel-
ist of sugary fiction meets a romantic
admirer owing to his hat having blown in
at the open window of the room where she
sat, at midnight, reading his latest novel.
The author follows in pursuit of his hat,
and loves the lady ere proclaiming his iden-
tity. There is positively nothing in the
comedy except an atmosphere of truth in
cheerful characterisation and a sparkling air
of spontaneity in the dialogue. Three
brothers of the heroine, her grandmother, an
aged female servant of the family who lis-
tens at the keyhole, and the typist and fat
chum of the hero are other characters. Also
there is an incidental actress who blows
into his study to make the Romantic Young
Lady jealous. Mrs. Apperly in the name-
part was “just sweet” as usual; Helton
Daniel was a capital ornament to the light
literary profession, and Edith Appleton, as
the grandmother, an amusing relict of three
husbands.
Bernard Shaw usually interests audiences,
as well as readers, by his wit, his humorous
situations (false, as a rule), and vivid
flashes of truth in dialogue that sometimes
sounds natural to the character rather than
merely natural to Shaw. But in “Pyg-
malion,” staged at Melbourne Majesty’s last
week by tlie Sydney Repertory co., the
humor seems strained and the flashes of
truth few. It is difficult to detect a touch
of nature in the Professor of Phonetics and
his kindred bachelor spirit, experimenting
in teaching a daughter of the gutter to talk
and walk like a duchess. Doolittle the
Dustman, proud of belonging to the Unde-
serving Poor, and scornful of the fate which
inflicts a large income and social obligations
on him, is but a thin Shavian joke. In-
grained human snobbishness rejects the
notion of a Doolittle; and civilisation’s sen-
sibility and the instinct of Sex reject the
picture of two bachelors remaining indiffer-
ent to beauty in the girl who has adopted
them as teachers and friends. There is
heart as well as heartlessness in “You Never
Can Tell” and other wildly fanciful com-
edies by G.B.S. In “Pygmalion” the scien-
tists are repellent fictions. Moreover they
are not good fun. The comedy, honestly
considered, appears to base its claim to fame
on the “No bloody fear!” of Eliza uttered
under circumstances which give the lan-
guage a ring of untruth. Cut “No bloody
fear!” out of the dialogue, even as Samson
was shorn of his hair, and its strength leaves
it. Discussion as to whether the performers
realise the author’s cynical “conception” is
all in vain, seeing that he couldn’t really
imagine the characters’ existence. The per-
formers make the show moderately bright; it
would be that even if Mrs. Pitt Rivers,
who shows real talent in the later stages of
the comedy, were not the Gov.-General’s
daughter.
“De Luxe Annie,” venturing a Melbourne
revival at Her Majesty’s, is a narrow drama
for so broad a stage. Even though the
theatre retains a d.-c. enclosure that was
erected to make “The Beggar’s Opera”
appear less lost in the wilderness, it is still
too large for “De Luxe Annie.” Besides, an
ingeniously American play that begins with
a story told in a Pullman car (of a matron
who turned from virtuous domesticity when
something hit her on the head) has lost a
lot of its punch in five years. Emelie Polini,
as the forgetful lady ivith a genius for black-
mail, has only a little less appeal in her
rich voice than she had when she was more
girlish in the part. Frank Harvey is a
wasted force in the uncongenial character of
a crook, who respects the innocence of his
enthusiastic companion in crime; while Kay
Sou per, Maurice Dudley and John Fernside
are three members of the present support
who figured in the co. when “De Luxe Annie”
came as a novelty in “crook” melodramas.
At Melbourne Princess’s “Sweet County
Kerry” is doing a week of Doone. Many
years ago this paper said of “Sweet County
Kerry”: “The substance of the original play
—if it had any—must have been scooped
out to make room for insipid soft stuff and
saccharine matter, commonly known as
piffle.” The accusation holds good to-day.
when references to the wrongs of Erin and
the rebellion of 1798 are even less topical

the somewhat renovated voice of Allen finds

An all-Australian show in Melbourne;—
Portraits dominate the show of the Australian Art
Association at the Athenseum. The most unaffected
come from the brushes of Alex. Colquhoun and
Percy Leason, the latter furnishing a simple but
ingratiating study of a little girl. Leslie Wilkie’s
young woman (No. 49) carries more conviction than
the lady (No. 51) who is sacrificed to her walking-
stick and gloves. Charles Wheeler’s picture of a
politician’s fluffy daughter is a social paragraph in
paint and his “Amber Necklace” is pretty and effemi-
nate. Bernard Hall signs a ruby portrait of
General Charlie Ryan, and his frigid representation
“JOSEPH ENTANGLED,” AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Joseph (Lawrence Grossmith) annoys his
uncle (Winnington Barnes ), who special-
ises in telling the truth.
of Mrs. Pern is attractive for the sound painting
of the hands. W. B. Mclnnes has five striking can-
vases. One is inclined to snigger at the suggestion
of overbearing scholasticism in the stalwart figure
of Professor Masson, and one spares a smile for the
genial little man in kilts who makes you aware that
he is having his portrait taken. Yet one must
admire the craft of the artist, who is properly mas-
culine in his scorn of flattery and compromise.
George Bell sends a pleasing impression of Mrs.
Daryl Lindsay; but even a churchwarden would
not be tempted to linger near his damsel in the
altogether. Penleigh Boyd reveals his virtuosity
as a fashionable portraitist in No. 157, which has
a singular effectiveness because the lady appears
to be insensitive to her expensive clothes. A dim,
lithe dame, aloof and aristocratic, advertises Mar.v
Allen’s ability to use any member of her sex as a
decorative auxiliary; and, barring an impression Df
a nurse, Harry B. Harrison’s achievements are
worth while. His “Big Dam” is one of the happiest
landscapes in the exhibition.
sj« * * ;J:
In “Tons of Money,” at Melbourne Pal-
ace, one of the impostor husbands continues
to be billed as Andrew Iligginson, although
he is nowise recognisable by the audience.
Probably they would know him again if lie
were to burst into song. Unfortunately there
is no singing in “Tons of Money.”
At Melbourne Royal the late Joan of Arc
inspires Sally to do her best as dishwasher
and danseuse to win the affection of a
brighter young man (Herbert Brownie) than
her previous admirer. Otherwise “Sally” is,
or soon will be, the same as when it began
to boom. Gaston Mervale, the original
heavy parent of the young man, was said
last week to be about to resume work, after
resting in a private hospital, and talJ Pixie
Herbert was missing for only a day or two.
Her understudy was divinely tall' likewise,
but had not the exceptional length of impress-
ive Pixie, from whose shoulders, standing
on stilts, one might almost hitch one’s
waggon to a star.
“A Southern Maid” continues pleasing to
the optic and grateful to the tympanum at
Her Majesty's, Sydney. And the performers
look none the worse for the stimulus of the
whisky-and-soda, olives, hock and ice-cream
of the cafg scene.
At Sydney Opera House “The O’Brien
Girl” is developing a fine staying capacity.
She is in her tenth week, and her dancing
and good fun can still fill the big house.
At Sydney Royal Oscar Asche has only
two more nights to be a china-smashing bull
from the Argentine pampas—or wherever it
was that Maldonada came from to blight
the young life of Iris. A Moorish Oscar will
walk the boards on Saturday, and dramatic
critics are getting down their Shakspeares
in anticipation.
The plot and interest of “Joseph En-
tangled,” at Sydney Cri., continue to centre
in Lawrence Grossmith’s presentation of the
amiable baronet wdio lias devoted to philan-
dering and the social graces talents that
plight have made him a useful citizen. If
the London smart set of the pre-war days
was quite as rabbit-brained as the majority
of Joe Lacy’s acquaintances, it deserved
worse terms than even Father Vaughan ever
used about it.
“The Hairy Ape” makes his second indict-
ment against the social order to-night at St.
James’s Hall, Sydney.
& >1: :!= i!t
At Hoyt’s (Sydney) Tom Mix fills, the
bill this week with a challenge to his rivals
to “Catch My Smoke.” The background
hasn’t altered in the slightest; Tom has only
grown a little more reckless, that is ali.
“Money, Money, Money,” with Katherine
McDonald and her screen mamma as arch
cadgers and giddy spendthrifts, paints a
sorry picture of what happens when the sup-
posedly bottomless well dries up. ‘‘Has the
World Gone Mad?” is under consideration
at the Globe and Rialto. Everything points
that way until a wedding-ring maker is
called upon to carry out a job in the last
act; and the audience is expected to accept
that as a sign of sanity upon somebody’s
part. Fay Compton is the heroine of Clem-
ence Dane’s repertory play, “A Bill of
Divorcement,” transferred to shadowland,
and now the most attractive thing on the
Lyceum’s linen.
** * *
Sydney sees more pictures:—
H. S. Power has a little show of 28 items at
Anthony Horderns’ Gallery—a p.p.c. affair, as lie
is off to England again as soon as he finishes the
big mural decoration for the Melbourne Public
Library. These pictures show what a versatile
person Power is: there are figures, horses, dogs and
landscapes done, and done well, in water-color and
in oil, and he tops off with a few admirable studies
on silk. He is at his best in some of the water-
colors in which his sturdy, hairy-legged draughts
are at work on roads flanked by venerable gums.
Here he combines a fine sense of design, a discern-
ing appreciation of bush atmosphere, a confident
handling of clear color, and a conscientious draughts-
manship—though, as to the last, it is curious ho.v
such a fine draughtsman should have slipped with
the hindquarters of a near-side horse in his big
“Timber Team.”
Another little show attracting attention is the
exhibition of Lionel Lindsay’s and Sydney Ure
Smith’s etchings at Farmer’s Gallery. It consists
largely of prints already familiar to the public,
but Lindsay has several new things, including
Spanish, bush and Old Sydney studies; and Smith
shows a fine impression of a ramshackle old barn.
From an Adelaide critic:—
The 25th annual Federal show of the S.A. Society
of Arts is to he the last for the present. It was
a big success at first. Artists from other States
were well represented for some years, and the Adel-
aide Art Gallery has built up a strong Australian
room mainly by its purchases made at these shows.
But gradually those who had been bought didn’t
trouble to send any more; and the Gallery Board
has almost ceased buying. Then, of the local men,
Power., Will Ashton and Hayley Lever left S.A..
and Heysen is too busy (or something) to exhibit
at these shows. An effort was made to get Sydney
and Melbourne to run them in turn; that
having failed,' the fixture proposes to fade away. The
current exhibition may be summed up as the weakest
“TONS OF MONEY,” AT MELBOURNE
PALACE.

Heslop) discover they're rich when- the

on record. Nothing stands out. The new Aiec Mel-
rose prize for a portrait brings a lot of competitors;
but D’Auvergne Boxall wins the prize easily with
a portrait of his sister. It has grace, and that is
the thing in which local figure-painters are lacking.
Melrose has now offered another prize for grouped
figure-compositions in the hope that young painters
will study anatomy.

The Motor improves
with use
After the First Ten Thousand Miles
When most cars leave the factory their motors are at the highest point of
efficiency. From that day on, as the mileage increases, they gradually grow less
powerful, become noisy and choked with carbon, until at 10,000 miles many
pounds have to be spent in engine overhaul, carbon removal, valve grinding,
etc. And this overhauling has to be repeated an increasing number of times as
the car gets older.
The Willys-Knight Motor, on the contrary, actually improves
with use—-it wears in while others wear out. It increases in power
-—in flexibility—in economy. At 10,000 miles the motor is better
than when new.
Carbon, the foe of other motors, actually increases compression
in the sleeve-valve Willys-Knight engine.
That such world-famous cars as the Daimler, Panhard, Peugeot,
Mors, Voisin, Mercedes and Minerva all have Knight engines is
convincing proof of the superiority of the KNIGHT ENGINE.
Willys-Knight bodywork, finish and design, combined with a motor that is
generally acknowledged to be supreme among all others, make a combination
unexcelled by any car within hundreds of pounds of its price.
The WILLYS-KNIGHT is the only complete
Knight-engined Car of over 20-h.p.
selling at under £lOOO.

“0.K.”: Fanny Wiseman, who abides
these days at St. Kilda (Melbourne), arrives
next month at the 70tli anniversary of her
first appearance on the stage. Boxing Night,
1853, was the occasion when young Fanny
did the fairy stunt at the old Queen’s Theatre,
Melbourne. She doesn’t dance anywhere
nowadays. For over a year the fragile little
woman has suffered from a spinal affection—
rheumatoid arthritis—and she is now speaking
harshly of the Melbourne weather she has
known so long. There are some old theatre-
goers to whom it might occur to work up a
suitable commemoration of Fanny Wiseman’s
70th stage-birthday.
“Fax”: Dorothy Brunton will presently
abandon the mock French accent and doleful
black frock she sports in “Tons of Money”
and break out as principal girl in the “Mother
Goose” panto, which Hugh Ward is to pro-
duce at Melbourne Palace.
From Thames-side:—
Marie Lobr is doing so well in the provinces with
Sutro’s “Laughing Lady” that she won’t return to
London till Christmas-time. Then she will be
seen in “Far Above Rubies,” another of Sutro’s
comedies. Meanwhile her Globe Theatre houses
Somerset Maugham’s “Our Betters,” and Anthony
Prinsep, her husband, stoutly avers that if business
continues as at present he may have to hire another
theatre in which to present the Sutro play.
Connie Ediss is back after a long absence. - Her
last London appearance was at the Empire in “The
Smith Family,” which was a bit of a frost. Before
that she had spent a very pleasant and
profitable year, or - thereabouts, with Cyril
Maude at the Criterion in “Lord Richard
in the Pantry,” and it is at the Ori. she
is now appearing in a piece called “Trust Emily.”
It deals with the adventures of a young Englishman
who comes home from Australia in search of a
wife.
Harry Lauder has broken out in a fresh place—a
couple of them, in fact. In collaboration with his
Scottish manager, J. Hall Nicol, he has evolved a
three-act musical play called “Our Ain Folk,” and
it is to have a trial trip in Glasgow'. Harry has
also invaded Movieland with a three-reel film-story
based on his song, “I Love a Lassie.” Most of the
photography was done in a nd about the Lauder home
on the Clyde.
“Thersites” : Maoriland seems to be look-
ing up from the Poverty Point of view. For
the first time in years the J.O.W. banner will
wave over four’ shows simultaneously. Mem-
bers of “The Cabaret Girl” co., “The Beg-
gar’s Opera” co., the Gertrude Elliott co.
and Lawrence Grossmitli’s co. will all
hang up their Christmas stockings in the
Tremulous Islands.
“Norbell” : When I was somewhat younger
—in ’96, to speak by the card—l “stormed”
in Maryborough and Bundaberg (Q.) as a
member of Alfred Dampier’s "Robbery
Under Arms” band of bushrangers. A local
musician of some tonnage acted as our chef
d’orchestre. He had just added to his repu-
tation for charming the savage breast by
playing a piano in the lions’ cage—with the
lions for company—at a visiting circus. Ilis
name was Moncrieff. Gladys’s father, in fact.
“Mancam” gives a send-off:—
Clyde Meynell is throwing in his marble as a
member of the J.C.W. directorate at the end of
January, and goes back to Britain for a long holi-
day. He began as an actor in one of the English
stock companies, and played small parts in London
with the Compton Comedy Co., Compton being the
father of Betty and Fay, much in the film and
stage limelight to-day. Harcourt Beatty was
another small-part man in the same show. After
that Meynell went to Edinburgh, studied medicine
and qualified, but, returning to the stage, he entered
into partnership with Horace Lingard. Next he
was business manager for Mi* i Fortescue, who
breaeh-of-promised Lord Garmoyle. He was also
in partnership with Ada Reeve’s husband, Cotton,
and later was associated with Beerbobm Tree. He
came to these parts as producer for “Resurrection,”
“The Eternal City” and “Monsieur Beaucaire”
with the Julius Knight-Maud Jeffries co. It is
more than likely that he will return to Australia
with a theatrical enterprise of his own.
“Second Murderer”: “Herodot’s” tale (B.
15./11/’23) of the wire-netting curtain used
at Castlemaine (Vic.) to protect mummers
from showers of eggs and vegetables—l
thought it was nuggets of gold the miners
threw, but he may be right—reminds me of
another feature of that old theatre, the
Royal. On either side of the proscenium
was painted a stage box, and the imagina-
tive artist had filled these with a fashion-
able party of crinolined dames and whis-
kered bucks in evening-dress. The idea was
that, no matter how thin the house, the
simple-minded mutnmer might always feel
that he had the fashionable part of the
theatre well filled. The illusion was not
quite convincing, though I do remember one
sozzled comedian who insisted on bowing
politely to the painted tableaux in the boxes
every time he came on.
“Alaric”: In the amateurs’ performance
at Melbourne Majesty’s the one radical de-
parture from the text of “Pygmalion” was
in the use of the sanguinary adjective which
shocks the unsophisticated in the third act.
Instead of saying “Not likely,” as in
the printed version, Eliza Doolittle rips out
the more colloquial and heartfelt “No
fear!” The phrase in the book has the
appearance of a literary invention designed
to secure the maximum of theatrical effect.
To Eliza’s slum pals it would have seemed
an affectation.
“Ashmead”: Alex. F. Lithgow, who con-
ducts St. Joseph’s Band (the oldest in the
Commonwealth) in Launceston (Tas.), has
taken to song writing. Four of his ballads
(J. Stewart Gill wrote the verses) were
given an airing at a Launceston concert
for which all the music had been composed by
the conductor. The affair was in aid of the
Japanese relief fund, but as an Australian
composer has no honor in his own country,
only about 50 people turned up to hear Lith-
gow’s dainty ditties and rousing marches.
There would have been 20 times that num-
ber had he been advertised to fight the first
cornet.
“Stabbard Lyte” lets himself go:—
We have no dramatic criticism in the daily press.
In Sydney, at any rate. We knew it before, but the
production of “The Hairy Ape” by the Playbox
Society drove it home. One morning paper com-
plained that stokers are not really nice men.
They swear and drink. They blaspheme. They be-
have, in short, like stokers. Another writer re-
marked that “the ladies wore some very pretty
dresses.” That is apparently all he got out of
“The Hairy Ape,” a great modern play with a
punch that should drive ideas into the thickest
head.
Can t the old ladies who “do” the show notices
see things from any point of view but their own?
See Bob Smith as the millionaire’s daughter sees
him —and recoil in horror? See fashionable, prink-
ing men and women as a stoker sees them ? Nobody
cares about the personal prejudices and predilections
ALL THAT MATTERS.
“She has false teeth, wears a wig and buys
her complexion."
“Pooh, that doesn’t matter. Her legs are
her own."
of these critics, so-called. Their function is to
recognise what the dramatist and his interpreters
are driving at and to report it faithfully. In this
they fail.
Nobody claims that the performance was without
faults. It was chockful of faults. Nearly every-
thing was wrong. Everything, perhaps, except the
thing that matters most. The play did “get over.”
Its very crudity of presentment, the frightful, almost
suffocating want of space-—these rather added to than
detracted from the actor's conception of Bob Smith’s
confused and agitated brain-box in which the be-
ginnings of a mind struggled for life. “The Hairy
Ape” is real drama. We may or may not see drama again
in Sydney during the next 10 years. Meanwhile
our critics may sharpen their brains and their
lady-like pens on “The O'Brien Girl” and her sisters,
on out-of-date problem plays like “Iris,” neither
young nor old enough to be interesting, and on the
anaemic productions of the Repertory Society, which
persists in putting on popular successes (or failures)
that are not Repertory shows at all.
SALESMANSHIP.
THE ARTIST : “The Potts-Pelf woman would
have bought it, but she thought it could
not be any good because my trees were
green. I pointed out that trees some-
times do look green."
THE MODEL: “Silly! You should have said
green trees have come into fashion
again."
“Lud”: “M.P.A.’s” preference for Nellie
Stewart’s performance of “Sweet Nell” (B.
8/11/’23), after seeing Laurette Taylor in
the l'Qle, seems to be a case of “first impres-
sions.” For Laurette is undoubtedly an
actress of parts. Any player who can cap-
ture London, as she did, and make a long-
sustained hit in such a mediocre thing as
“Peg o’ My Heart,” is no second-rater. In
the same way i am pretty sure that, if
I were to see Miss Stewart as “Nell,” she
would not displace the image of Julia Neil-
son, who played it for years in England, and
whom I thought perfect. That would be
merely the result of “first impressions” in
my case.
“Hamfat”: Yes, fulminations from the
pulpit are great house-fillers (B. 8/11/’23) ;
but the difficulty is to get them going. In
a co. I was connected with we used to book
the local hall for two nights, but advertise
one performance only. We would invite all
the parsons to come along and see that our
version of “Sappho” was not as luscious
as our press pars, hinted it was. Some would
refuse in letters that were usually good adver-
tising, but the majority came, and were
audibly shocked —we always put them near
the press-seats. Their running comments
brightened up next day’s papers. Alongside
appeared the intimation —announced, too, be-
fore the performance closed —that in response
to many requests “Sappho” would be repeated
for one more night. It was invariably the
second performance that drew the bumper
house.
“Fax”: W. R. Coleman, back in Melbourne
from a tour of inspection beyond the seas, is
at work on scenery for the J.C. W. “Aladdin”
panto. The result will be thankfully re-
ceived. It seems quite a long time since
Australia saw Willie Coleman, at his best.
From an old sawdust hand:—
The circus Fitzgeralds had the roughest of times
before they made their rise. I was with them in
1892, on a wet and disastrous trip through the
Monaro. Wages were overdue, the menu had got
down to corned-beef, bread and pumpkin, and 1
pulled out. But they battled on, and turned up
in Sydney next year, a bit ahead of it, but not
much. They got permission to show on the Bene-
volent Society’s ground at the foot of Devonshire-
street, opposite the old railway-station. Sam Walder
provided a tent, Hudson put in seats, Miller of
Melbourne sent along half a ton of dead-stock
poster stuff. Uniforms for band and staff were
hired from the stores. What an opening night it was,
and what a scratch show! At the interval 1
helped the brothers across to their pub. with the
“peter”—nearly. £6OO. .. Half-way. through the
count Dan ordered wine. Then he hurried back
to put Commodore through his act, while Tom
went in search of a bank-manager. Next day the
town was dredged for talent, and by the enc
the week, Sydney being circus-mad, the 10 10
were sitting behind a small pile- By th< : ’
■J. Minahan, now M.L.A. for Sydney, used to ) '
a cornet in Fitzgeralds' band.
“S.T.S.” : What might happen to a gentle-
manly convict in 1803 (from the newly-puD-
lished Farington diary) :—•
Mrs. Grose, wife of the late Governor of Botany
Bay, said Sir Horace Hayes, who was transporueJ
from Cork, was there, where his situation was hiom
forlorn. He would not associate with the othoi
convicts, and persons of character would not associate
with him. She saw him occasionally walking by
himself and reading, with much appearance ot
melancholy.
Hayes (whose name was really Sir Henry)
had been sentenced to death for carrying oft
the heiress of a leading Quaker family in
Cork; transported, he built a place for him-
self at Vaucluse, which was later tlie home
of Wentworth, “the Father of the Consti-
tution.” Cork, by tlie way, made a comic
song of the abduction, and tlie refrain of
“Sir Hen-ery kissed tlie Quaker” was long
a local public favorite.
“0.K.”: In the drama be has bad pro-
duced by the London Repertory, Frank A.
Russell, the Australian, was working on an
old theme, done to death in tlie sixties and
seventies of last century. A man returns
from abroad personating a dead, or supposed
to be dead, person. I can call to mind seve-
ral such impersonations by women, though
not by men. H. J. Byron used the theme in
“Blow for Blow”: Tom Robertson in
“Home” ; Wilkie Collins in “The New Mag-
dalene,” and Miss Braddon in “Sir Jasper’s
Tenant.”
Norman Campbell on art and the theatre:
In Alexander Woollcott’s “Shouts and Murmurs”
there is a story of a broken-down actor sharing a
park-seat with a shabby street-walker. “Ah,
madam,” says the tragedian,, “ quelle ironie!
The two oldest professions in the world ruined
by amateurs.” As far as the modern stage is
concerned the old mummer’s gibe is not without
justice, for in these days of “types”—-an invention
or convention of the cinematograph “producer”—a
kind of topsy-turvy survival of the fittest obtains.
If he makes a hit as Charles-liis-friend, the actor
must go on being that colorless foil of the jeune
premier till the end of the chapter. The modern
actor may, and very often does, carry one successful
performance from play to play, and finishes up by
having acted only one part in all his career.
To be successful to-day the actor must be a
specialist in one kind of part. If he looks like
Napoleon, he must wait for his chance until “A
Royal Divorce” or “Madame Sans-Gene” is revived.
Yet we have native actors capable of playing almost
any kind of part. For them the “type” is in the
make-up box. “Jimmy” Atholwood, for example,
has played Napoleon, Banquo, Daniel Jaikes, Nero,
Warrigal (“Robbery Under Arms”), Romeo and
Cassim (“Forty Thieves”) acceptably. Oscar Asche
has been playing Maldonado in Pinero’s “Iris,”
a part last played here by Robert Brough. Can one
imagine two more opposite “types”?
The specialist is too often an amateur in the
sense that he knows how to present only one kind
of character. It has been remarked that, the best
actors in London are those who have been associated
with the greatest number of unsuccessful plays. - The
failures run only for a week or two, and a succes-
sion of short runs gives the actor his chance in
diverse roles.
A musical-comedy idol wouldn’t hear of altering
his appearance or camouflaging his charms. Whether
he is Apollo or Apollyon lie must wear the same
greasepaint-mask. Indeed, his employer wouldn’t
allow him to modify his pulchritude or sink his
identity. On the same principle Charlie Chaplin
would be quite unconvincing without his moustache
and nigger-minstrel feet. So, too, when actors are
engaged for a No. 2, or touring co., here or in Lou-
don, they are required to sit in the stalls) and watch
the original cast at work, and they are expected to
reproduce all the parlor tricks and’ mannerisms as
faithfully as may be. It is pure mimicry, and is the
ruin of artistic acting.
“Hamfat” : The actor’s tendency to “put
in the nips” is natural enough. Horace
Blaggs, in a good engagement, or just re-
turned from a tour on which the ghost
walked regularly, becomes accustomed to
lending half-crowns to unfinancial artists;
be knows that when he has been out of a
job for a while—“out of a job” is one of
the phases of Thespian life—be will re-
ceive where once he gave. It is a sort of
Freemasonry; and if a good many non-
nuumners get bitten it is their own fault.
In the philosophy of the profession he who
is not an actor is an audience. And audi-
ences are made for only one purpose.
The Bulletin tries to make its Christ-
mas number a fair representation of the best
that Australia is doing at the moment in
prose, verse and black-and-white. Surveying
the 64 pages which are now in the printer's
hands and will be published on Dec. 8, it
looks as though, generally speaking, the Aus-
tralian prose-writer is doing better work
than the verse-writer. There are a few
good sets of verses; but the average is not
up to the best. The short stories, on the
other hand, include at least a dozen that are
worth a place in any collection of Australian
work; and the black-and-white is consider-
ably above the .average as to both artistic
quality and humor.
THE BETTER PART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Many Australians with a talent for acting are in
the 13 Houses of Parliament, posing, strutting and
g< ticulatirig.”— The Bulletin 20/9/’23.
Blcggs studied for the stage,
But heavy was the grind ;
His name in history’s page
As mummer ne’er you’ll find,
For churlish proved the Fates —
No fat parts came his way;
“My Lord, the carriage waits,”
Was all he got to say.
So, having learnt some stagey tricks,
He left the boards for politics.
And on a soap-box he
Orated to the mob,
Till soon as an M.P.,
He got a steady job.
And now in Parliament,
You’ll often hear folks say;
“The stage, it’s evident,
Has lost an actor!” Nay!
Bloggs, M.P., gets a thou, a year-
His acting couldn’t buy him beer!

The Car of Many Miles
IR* ACH Paige-Jewett motor car constructed
JL-' is a separate unit in itself —that is why
supervision is so rigid and exacting.
The Paige-]ewett works builds motor cars so
that the running up of the miles into tens
of thousands, with the ordinary care one
should give a piece of expensive machinery,
only adds to its already earned reputation
for dependability.
In fact, the first thousand miles of a Paige-
Jewett Six is only a tryout. It is the many
thousands of miles to follow for which
Paige-Jewetts are built.
It is worth looking into the construction of
a motor car when buying. We welcome it.
Paige-Jewett Special Six is the specially
equipped Standard Paige-Jewett with acces-
sories both useful and ornamental —just
those you need without the excessive cost.

Behind the SAVAGE
| I* VERY appliance known in
ITI/ modern gun making is used
in the manufacture of SAVAGE
Arms and the thorough system
of testing makes them undeniably
dependable. A SAVAGE must
pass muster after every step in
manufacture to get out into the
market. This is the reason why
SAVAGE Firearms are the great-
est gun values today.
The prospective purchaser of
sporting arms should inspect the
SAVAGE line. All models are
made in an adequate range of
calibres.
The Savage Single Shot Rifle
Model 1904 has bolt action mech-
anism of military type, 18-inch
round barrel, full form walnut
stock. Weighs about 3 lbs.
See your dealer about the
SAVAGE that will best suit you.

Count Seven: Oh, no; it's not a "vastly
different tiling.” The law lias the right to use
force, and neither Tom Walsh nor anyone else has
the right to urge any private citizen to meet
that force with force. .. .D.T.W.: But as far as V*«
know, nobody has ever accused Ashbolt of favoring
his old firm.... Grid: Not very appetising. .. X 'apt.
Barnett: Glad to hear the English are producing
saleable films. But our chief concern is to get
Australian-made films. .. .M.M.: No, it was the work
of a man who spent four years there. .. .ICnighty;
True, but you don’t make any. new point or sharpen
any old one. . . .M.McI.: Others got in ahead of
you. Hope to hear from you again.... Tren: Too
late... .S.A.A.: There is no music in it... .R.R.D.:
“Last Case” is a good yarn not well t01d... .Wishing
Well: It will make a very usable par H.R.E.:
Fear it’s too ancient to find. On the sample, it
seems hardly worth finding... . Tyum: You need
better subjects and the better subjects need better
handling. .. .Eric L.: That telephone stuff has been
better done. .. . M.S.M .: Avaunt! Not to say shoo!
....Janus: You thought the old man might be a
genius because he wanted to abolish payment of
members and go back to the old conditions. Well,
we 11!.... G. WAV.: Says nothing that was worth any-
thing. .. .C. Mac..: The: “Styx Express” would do ful-
some brightening. .. .J.J.J.; “The Quick Way” dues
not make a yarn.... Margot M.: Too wordy and it
does not seem real... .E.H.R.: We could find no
joy in it. ... A.L.H.: Futile and tedious.. . .A.C.M.:
Not the apples for this barrow.... G.E. (Vermont):
Ponderous efforts after solemn mirth... .Ripponlea :
Here’s the best part of the charming little thing:—
Bill Reilly, the local blacksmith,
Could neither read nor write,
And one day a bloke called Jack Smith
Discovered Reilly’s plight.
lie give him a Sunday-school leaflet
Told him they was smutty jokes;
Big Bill pursued the pages
And laughed with the other blokes.
They laughed to see Bill laughing,
He read to save his dignity;
They laughed till they was coughing
Because he read with impunity
And laughed because they was laughing.
. ...E.J.F.: The “Burning” verses have points, but
the metre flops too often. .. .L.M. (Gisborne): The
commonplaces that are on every tongue... .Curlew:
Weary poem that staggers to its doom. . . .T.is.:
The dying verses with no name are too crude. . . .
Jackdaw: It makes a small noise, but does it mean
anything?... .C.V.L.: A general attack like that
on “Greed” should make somebody rush out to give
the organ-grinder tuppence to go away F.M.E.:
The verse is fair, but not interesting. ... Q.P.: They
both miss... . W.P.J.: The verse isn’t strong enough
to carry it in. ... Ashmead: Good enough for home
consumption, but doesn’t cry for print H.E.F.:
Take out the affectations, and how much is left?
.... Donald P.: Here’s your sunset and moonrise:—
Though Titan thou hast crept
Beneath yon dipping sea,
And in thy place bereft
Thy weaker mate sent thee.
. ...Lezem: The “Ghost” is still not well enough
served up. .. .Malcolm L.: There is nothing in it lo
make a meal... .R.H.8.: Not enough interest to
carry it through King K.: Weak and wooden. .. .
F.H.8.: Piles up a few familiar phrases to say that
the sunrise happened W.M.8.L.: None have
enough meat in them. .. .K.W.C.: Not for u 5....
A.H. (Croydon): Feeble little flutter. ... .H.S.S.:
It’s only a noise... .Marieda B.: None of them up.
The sonnet is nearest, but it moves as though it
had been lying out in the damp overnight....
C.V.L.: Terrible stuff.. . .W.J.W.: Not quite terrible;
hut not quite g00d... .E.R.R.: You seem to have a
story to tell; now try to write it in some known
language... .Bertram I: Facts about seaweed put
into poor verse... .Burry Doone: It doesn’t hit us
hard enough. .. .Bellerive: A tribute to the pioneers:
Among mountains and hills
In the far out-back,
On the trail of brave leaders
They followed the track;
Through wild tangled scrub
And huge shadowy trees,
Tanned by the sun
And fanned by the breeze ;
Across desolate plains,
Wide, dry and accurst,
Where rovers before ’em
Dad perished from thirst;
Against reptiles and blacks,
Hard, daring and bold,
Omvard they journeyed
To seeketh for gold.

A photographer called on my firm a few

m several periodicals, it was suggested that
we would thus get a good advertisement —•

The Commercial Hotel, on the n.-e. corner of

Kighty-five years ago it was known as the Bunch
of Grapes; James Cunninghame, who kept it in
the mid-forties, changed the name to the Com-
mercial. Later Bungs at this tavern were Thomas
Martin, Jacob Myers and William Camb, captain of
the Volunteer Fire Brigades in the early ’seventies.
Then came Bass Hodge, who had been bandmaster
of the 11th Reg. and janitor and drillmaster of
Sydney Grammar School. The old house has seen
many changes since BassVtime. It is'Understood that
the present owner, a Melbourne man, intends building

“Top Rail” : Cudgen, on the North Coast
(N.S.W.), is an example of what the Fat-
man can do when his inclinations turn in
the right direction. A score of years ago it
was a rapidly-degenerating sugar plantation,
owned by one ■ man and worked practically
by Kanakas, a few whites acting as gangers
in the_ fields, and doing such skilled work in
the mill as brother Solomon couldn’t manage.
On the magnate’s death the plantation was
sold to the C.S.R. Co. The obsolete mill was
closed, and the land cut into decent living
areas and sold to white farmers; fine cot-
tages, erected on each block, were sold with
the soil on long terms. To-day almost the
whole area is under cane and Cudgen is
once more one of the most prosperous cor-
ners of the North Coast.

Parama” ’ There’s money for someone in
the bush ropes of New Guinea. These vines
contain a wire-tough fibre that can be cut
to lengths of anything up to 50ft. The
natives use them for every purpose to which
thread, string, rope and wire,
and have an article which is tougher and
stronger than any of them. I have seen bind-
mgs of these fibres round old weapons,
devils and masks, and in the mako-up of
decorations which, according to their owners
were over ; so years old; and in every case
the rope was as strong as when first put
on, though the rest of the contraptions, in
many cases, showed signs of wear, tear and
age. On one occasion the “boys” made a
line over 150 ft. long of these fibres, and
with it towed a string of logs down the river
a job that had proved one too many for
Tw^ m f h ? e 1 carri . ed on the launch,
ihere is almost an unlimited supply of these

capital to make a good thing out of them.

Milk is a menace to man and to maiden,
To mothers, boys, babies alike, when germ-laden.

From poisons that lurk in tuberculous dairies?
■Drawn from the cow through immaculate udders,
Freshest of milk is a matter for shudders
Where cans are unclean, for r.o act can be vainer
Than putting pure milk in an impure container ;
’Tis brought in the morning, escaping inspection,

Imparting diseases which oft become chronic.
Alas ! for the milk that is new and pneumonic!

Unite in denouncing damn dirty utensils.

Corsets Specially Designed For YOU
GOSSARD Corsets are not designed like
other corsets. Gossard artists have
thought of you as belonging to one of the
nine ideal figure groups into which they
have divided all women. Special models
have been created for your particular fig-
ure needs—differently proportioned cor-
sets, differently boned corsets that will give
you just the support you need at your age
and your weight to comfortably coax you
to the ideal proportions of your type.
A Gossard Corset designed for your very
own self is going to feel more comfortable
than you thought a corset could. It’s going
to meet you everywhere, with a steady,
uniform muscular support, but it isn’t
going to constrict or pinch you anywhere.
The whole idea of Gossard Type Cor-
setry is to bring you to graceful propor-
tions, one curve growing cut of another
with no part unduly emphasized. When
this is done you will have an appearance
of slimness that the woman with a four-inch
smaller waist and your own hip measure-
ments can never have. A faithful follow-
ing of this simple rule will alone take
pounds and pounds away from a.woman's
apparent silhouette and years away from
her apparent age.
Be honest with yourself: —are you com-
pletely satisfied with both the appearance
and comfort of the corset you are now
wearing? Or does it cut into your limbs, or
push up the bust when you are seated, or
cause an awkward, unbecoming bulge of
flesh under the shoulder blades and under
the arms, or do any of those many irritat-
ing things that the wrong corset can do to
hurt you and tire you out and make you
look years older than you really are?
When you can purchase a gentlewoman’s
corset for as little cost as the ordinary kind,
an exactly-right Gossard will make the

most of your natural beauty, will protect
your health, will be comfortable every
minute you have it on, will wash beau-
tifully and outwear two or even three ord-
inary corsets?
Go to the Best Store You Know
The stores selling Gossard Corsets take
pride in their service. You will be fitted by
an expert corsetiere who knows figure types
as well as corsets and who will assume full
responsibility for your satisfaction.
Gossard Brassieres
Gossard Brassieres, like Gossard Cor-
sets, are designed for the needs of the
nine figure groups. The new Longerlyne
models are priceless to the woman who
heretofore has been unable to find bras-
sieres with special shaping to support and
flatten the diaphragm and with extra
length to prevent them from slipping up
over the lower tops of the modern corsets.
Yet they are most reasonably priced
within the reach of every purse.

The Missing Pearls.
(By “PHLOX.”)
H, my pehrls, my precious mascot.
1 B The necklet was given me by a
Roumanian prince, and I never
make a first-night appearance unless wearing
it.”
Miss St. Julian, the celebrated English
actress all Austral.an management had been
fortunate in securing for a season, had only
arrived in Sydney the day before, with other
members of the company, and was making
her Sydney debut that evening. When she
retired for the night she watched her maid
put the precious pearls away. In the morn-
ing they were gone.
To the suggestion that her maid had taken
them Miss St. Julian turned a deaf ear. She
trusted Marie as she would her own sister,
A notice telling of the missing pearls and
the reward offered for them was posted up
in the hotel. The head detective had just
remarked that it was one of the most baf-
fling cases he had met, when a hotel guest
came along with the startling information
• that in the dead of night he had seen a very
beautiful woman tiptoe into Miss St.
Julian’s room, and just as noiselessly tiptoe
out again with something in her hand. To
the detective’s inquiry as to what he himself
was doing awake at that hour of the night,
he explained that the night being insufferably
hot, he had left his door open, and he had
seen the vision from his bed.
“Would you know her again?”
“Certainly, she had a wealth of golden
hair, a perfect complexion, and soulful grey
eyes. Sh —sh. There she is.”
“Miss Mountford, I. believe?” inquired the
detective. “This is Mr. Vernon. He tells me
that he saw you steal into Miss St. Julian’s
loom about midnight.”
Miss Mountford laughed merrily.
“This is no laughing matter,” the detective
reminded her. “Were you in Miss St.
Julian’s room about midnight?”
“Yes.”
“What for?”
“To borrow something. Miss St. Julian
was asleep, so I took it.”
“Took what?”
“Oh, I’ll explain that little matter to Miss
St. Julian herself when I see her.”
“You know her pearls are missing?”
“Good heavens ! You surely are not hint-
ing that I took them.”
“Well, there’s the circumstantial evidence,
and many a person has been convicted on
that. Miss St. Julian swears by her maid’s
honesty, and the hotel management swears
by its staff.”
“If the imputation were not so preposter-
ous, I should say you were insulting me.”
Miss St. Julian then came to the door to
inquire if there were any developments.
“Oh, you’re there, Ida,” she remarked to
Miss Mountford. “Assisting the detectives
I presume.”
“Well, the detective and this gentleman
have as good as told me that I took the
pearls.”
“Nonsense.”
“But Miss Mountford acknowledges steal-
ing quietly into your room about midnight.”
“I went in to borrow something.”
“What did you borrow?” asked the detec-
tive, eyeing her critically.
“I know,” said Miss St. Julian, “that
my tin of mercolized wax is missing, as well
as my pearls.”
“That’s what I borrowed, and your tin of
stallax as well, because my dressing-case has
been mislaid. I knew you wouldn’t mind.”~
“Of course not, but I did miss the merco-
lized wax after my bath.”
“What is mercolized wax and what is
stallax?” asked the detective.
“Mercolized wax,” replied Miss St. Julian,
“is that wonderful preparation with which
we actresses regain our youthful com-
plexions. It does this by harmlessly remov-
ing the old, worn-out skin, thus enabling the
new skin underneath to show up. Stallax
we use as a shampoo to keep our hair beauti-
ful.”
“Dear me, that’s very interesting. But
you see what an invidious position it has
put you into, Miss Mountford. You’ve got
to prove to the satisfaction of the law that
you did not take the pearls at the same time
that you took —-er—borrowed the mercolized
wax and stallax. You must not leave this
office until the mystery has been cleared up.”
“Then I am under arrest. It’s monstrous.”
Miss St. Julian was wanted in another
direction. Other detectives had been follow-
ing up another clue. The housemaid who
attended to Miss St. Julian’s room and a
porter in the hotel were soon to be married
and leave for San Francisco. Their respec-
tive rooms had been searched, but nothing
had been found. Still, Detective Murphy
wasn’t satisfied. He again visited the girl’s
room.
“Why did you give the pearls to Jenkins?”
lie asked her.
“I didn’t give the pearls to Mr. Jenkins,”
she replied defiantly.
Murphy never took his eyes off the girl,
and presently her eyes wandered to a boot-
shelf in the room. Murphy lifted up the
boots, and several of the pearls which had
been unstrung dropped from the boots to
the floor. “Are all the pearls here?” he
asked.
“Yes, every one, and Mr. Jenkins knows
nothing about my taking them,” cried the
girl, sobbing violently.
“I arrest you in the King’s name, Beatrice
Turner.”
The head detective apologised to Miss
Mountford, and at the same time advised
her not to again borrow toilet preparations
from a friend on the same night that her
jewels are stolen. —Advt. [5

‘■Blanc’': Let me place a small bouquet
alongside “Artilleur’s” (B. 11/10/23).
The diary of Col. Durrant, C-. 0. Fighting
13th, for April 4, 1917 —just before Bnlle-
court —reads : “Near Favreuil. On walking
through the German military cemetery we
could not help noticing that the grave of
a British airman was remarkably well cared
for; a cross equal to any of those provided
for their own graves had been erected ; even
Mowers had been planted.” On how many
German graves did we plant flowers?
The first child to bear the name Australia
was Alfred Australia Howe, son of Sydney's
second printer. Death waited implacably
for the unfortunate youngster in the water.
At the age of 4—in 1821 —he was with his
father, George Howe, when their boat was
upset off Pinchgut. The father was drowned
but the child was saved almost by a miracle.
Then, as a boy of 12, lie was paddling in
the river near Port Macquarie, when a shark
seized him by the feet and dragged him off.
He was rescued, but died soon after.
“The Wanderer" : The saw-edged bayonet
mentioned by “Centurion” (B. l/11/'23)
was certainly issued to British troops prior
to the Great War. Such a bayonet was
fitted to the Henry carbine (1872) and the
Martini-Henry (1893). These weapons were
only used by artillery and engineer units,
and it may be doubted whether they were
ever of much use. Some faint resemblances
may be found in them to the flamberge, a
two-handed sword, used almost exclusively
by German mercenaries during the greater
part of the 16th century. This sticker, with
two spikes near the hilt and a four-foot
blade with a wavy edge, was a formidable
weapon, but it was heavy and cumbrous and
disappeared about 1630.
“1728”: Let me add my testimony to
“L’Fou's” observations (B. 25/10/’23) as to
the poor showing the urban dweller makes
in birth statistics by the side of the rural
one. Among my cocky neighbors on the
N.S.W. irrigation areas are six couples who
during their years of married life in Sydney,
averaging between eight and nine, managed
to restrict their families to one apiece, but
who, since settling on the land, have again
and again qualified for the maternity bonus.
One, whose wife presented him with a child
during their first year of marriage and then
switched off until they turned their backs
on the city, has had cause to communicate
with the Registrar each year since and in-
cluding 1920. I saw him looking up a Rail-
way Guide after the last event.
“S.T.S.”: Recent pars, about the old comic
opera “Little Jack Sheppard” recall the
slap-in-the-face which Australia somehow
accepted from it as a joke. Those were days
(30 to 40 years ago) when men still lived
who could remember the convict era, and it
was not a thing to joke about. But “Little
Jack Sheppard” rubbed it in fearlessly, also
jumping ahead, with cheerful anachronism,
to satirise our modern title-hunters in Lon-
don. One verse ran thus :
For they know that the right way to please us is
To attend to each word that we say,
And they make us all K.G.M.G.’s-es-es,
Not mentioning Botany Bay.
And somehow Sydney laughed at the auda-
cious sentiment and the quaint rhyme as
hard as did Melbourne or Adelaide, which
had never had birthstains.
“O.K.'s” grumble:—
Increased cost of living would be much less of a
grievance if the living was as good as it was be-
fore vendors grew so rapacious. But it isn’t. Meat
in the joint is not up to pre-war standards in
quality; sausages are less succulent; the average
hen is even more skinny. M.L. smoked cod has
not only doubled in price during the last 10 years,
but it is not so well smoked as it was. Who
says the beer tastes as good as when it cost less
than half the money? My palate scorns the alle-
gation. And tobacco? Not so good as of old, I pro-
test. Apart from the increased cost of being alive
one complains of the diminished pleasure in remaining
so. We get inferior goods. The ribbon wherewith the
typewriter records my futile dissatisfaction is poorer
stuff than was manufactured before the price began
to rise. I can think of no material that has
changed for the better. Not even the fabric of my
dreams is of the same fine quality as when fancy
first wove it. In all respects T feel that I’m being
had.
“Quarter-slieet” ; Even if he doesn’t know
much about the theories of anarchy and
communism, “Jack” Lang, ex-Treasurer and
now Opposition leader in N. 8. Wales, has a
wider personal knowledge of the believers in
those and other freak gospels than any other
man in his State. For some years he man-
aged the lodging-house next “Mac’s book-
shop” and the Little Theatre in Castlereagh-
street, Sydney—lately erased to make room
for a telephone exchange—which was the
home of anarchists, communists, nihilists
and regular unemployed. It was from this
resort that Captain “Tommy” Dodd and
General “Jawbone Jack” recruited their regi-
ments that “demonstrated” and “agitated” at
election meetings from the early ’nineties on-
wards. The “No-Rent League” and “Active
Service Brigade” rank and file herded in the
huge barrack-like caravanserai. Henry Law-
son picked up much copy thereabouts, and.
by the way, Henry and Jack married two
of Mrs. Mac’s daughters.
“F.A.”: Bathurst (N.S.W.) was the first
country town on the Australian mainland to
have its own bank. The Bank of Bathurst
was founded in 1832; among the first sub-
scribers to the stock were the officers of the
military detachment then stationed at the
City of the Plains. The first manager was
T. M. Sloman, who dealt out £lO, £5 and
£1 notes. The institution paid several divi-
dends, but the Union Bank presently bought
it out and established its first branch in the
West. A year or two later it sold the busi-
ness to the Commercial Banking Company
of Sydney. When the Union took over the
assets and liabilities of the Bathurst Bank
it paid the latter’s notes as they came along;
but after a bit, when the stream of paper
had dwindled to a trickle, tenders were called
to find out what townsman of good repute
would accept the smallest amount from the
bank to settle its obligations. The successful
tenderer lost money over his enterprise, and
life developed into a sort of prolonged night-
mare —for years afterwards callers would
arrive and present dilapidated scraps of
paper which “always seemed to be ‘tens.’ ”

This Beautiful Girl
was Cured of a Terrible Burn
&
by Rexona
the Rapid
Healer.
“1 always advise my friends to use Rexona Ointment and
Rexona Soap, for I consider them par-excellent. I had a serious
burn on my left arm, which was scarred so badly that I could not
leave my long gloves off without having every eye upon me. As
I had always used Rexona Soap with satisfaction for several years
I decided to drop my visits to the hospital and try Rexona
Ointment. lam pleased to state that in two weeks it completely
healed my whole arm, and now you could scarcely recognise that
I was ever burned so severely. My friends and myself were so
gratified with the wonderful results that I can assure you I shall
always keep a tin of Rexona, the Rapid Healer, handy in the
future, and recommend it on
every occasion. I particularly
want to mention that the brown
burns are now white, and the
scars scarcely noticeable.”

At Compiegne (August
28, 1914) the ‘GREYS 1
imitated their tactics
at Waterloo, for they
plunged into the ranks of
the enemy, a soldier of the
“Black Watch" hanging
on to each horseman ; a
thrilling and fearful
episode .

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
fAM HE days: are furious with thought,
The hollow night is walled with
dreams
In a great arras, wildly wrought
From shadows shot with lurid gleams.
Below, the broad Pacific plain
Breaks into little tufts of foam,
While yonder lies, draped with raw rain,
The barren waterway to home.
The corn is cribbed, the fish are dried,
About the troughs the snares are set;
And, in the slow-incoming tide,
The stakes are lined about the net.
The eels are nosing down the creek,
Now that the autumn days are here,
White-bellied, wary-eyed and sleek
Into the trapped and waiting weir.
Red. ripened berries cluster thick
On Moru and Karaka tree.
Another notch upon the stick!
So ! One day’s off Eternity.
Wide arc the seas between your shore
And this. They hold us still apart—
The rover who will rove no more,
The woman with the broken heart.
Once Life was fair and laughter loud;
A courtly speech was on each tongue.
Thought like an archer keen and proud
Kept his long-bow for action strung.
Nor setting sun nor rising star
Gave pause to reason for regret.
Love was our only calendar;
No bounds unto his day were set.
A land of wealth, a land of flowers,
A land of music and of song;
A merry tyrant ruled the hours
And bade them gently lapse along.
Old Rome returned to revel there;
Crusaders from the Holy Land,
With noble heads unhelmed and bare,
Joined in our lordly saraband.
Men left the solemn halls of state,
The palaces and courts of kings,
The cool seclusion of the Great,
For masks and feasts and revellings.
I see you in the sconces’ light,
Bejewelled, beautiful, serene,
As though it were but yesternight,
With you a tourney’s lauded queen.
Again I feel the victor’s pride;
I feel possession envied me—
The asp-sting by which honor died
Cankers my soul with treachery.
Once, on a sudden, there careened,
Through scrub with tendrils interwove,
Roused like a hound’s whelp scarcely weaned,
I saw a whaler in a cove.
She lay with greasy, blackened snout,
A sea-sow nosing in the sod;
I saw white men and heard them shout,
And joyously blaspheme their God.
And there was happiness and help,
And fellowship and pipes and wine;
let close I cowered like the whelp,
Sub-silent, too far damned to 'whine.
I notch my stick and thus atone
For days that nourish my despair,
While through a rare-bleached human bone
Wild Mary squats and combs her hair.
MAORILAND.
DARIUS.
The Crabbiness of Miss Cripps.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAD made up my mind to leave
Miss Cripps’s place. I hate crabbi-
ness ; and I bad come to the conclu-
sion that Miss Cripps’s remarks about the
late hours at which I came home, and the
later ones at which I rose, betrayed an acid
flisposition. It was impossible for me to
make myself at home in a place so like home
—home being notoriously a place where any
man who retains bachelor weaknesses can
never be at home, even when he is there.
The argument of the morning which sealed
my intention had been a particularly heated
°no. After it there was a lull; and then
I heard a timorous tap at my door. The
head of old Bolgin, who occupied the room
next to mine, appeared.
“I hope you won’t mind my coming in for
a while,” he said.
“Have you been getting it, too?” I asked.
“No—although I frequently do.”
“And you’ve been hero for years. I won-
der why you stay.”
He passed his hand over his mostly-bald
head, as if it had suddenly occurred to him
that it was wonderful and he wanted to en-
courage his mind to think about it. A nug-
gety little man, at about the limit of middle-
age, Bolgin ran a prosperous grocery busi-
ness not far from Miss Cripps’s establish-
ment.
“I stay here,” he said impressively, “because
Miss Cripps is a splendid woman. I heard
what took place this morning, and that’s why
I came in—because I know you’ll think she’s
petty and narrow and exacting. I wished
to tell you that she’s a splendid woman.”
He was so earnest that I forebore to smile.
Miss Cripps did not impress one, at a glance,
as a splendid woman. She was still young,
but already the starved expression which
creeps upon many women as they approach
old-maidenhood was pinching a face that
had probably never been beautiful. Her
grey eyes purposeful, straight-gazing, fear-
less and yet soft were her best feature.
Like her house, she was always trim but
her temper was short. Certainly, very far
from the ordinary man’s notion of a splendid
woman.
“I ought to know,” said Bolgin. “I’ve
lived here for fifteen years. Ever since she
started the place. She was only sixteen when
she did that.”
“A pretty capable girl.”
“She was. And a splendid woman.” He
was not going to let me escape that.
Clearly he had something to say, and
equally clearly he was finding it hard to say
it.
“I want you to understand her,” he said.
“You see, you’re a writer chap ; and, then —
anyway, I wouldn’t like you to go away and
not understand her.”
There was a pause.
“Supposing there was a woman who had
drifted down until, what with drinking and
letting herself go, she had become a real bad
lot, losing any morals she may ever have had ;
and supposing she was made worse by a hus-
band who didn’t care what she did as long
as he wasn't bothered, and who was nearly
always away, anyhow. What sort of a chance
would four kids, if they were girls, have of
growing up decent?”
“Not much.”
“Supposing they were brought up with
strange men coming to the house, and
brawls, and drunkenness?”
“No chance at all,” I said.
“No, they wouldn’t,” he said ruminatingly.
“Except—except one of the girls was like
Chrissie —Miss Cripps : a splendid woman !
She was about 13 when I first remember
knowing Chrissie. I’d seen her before, but
it seems (as often happens with people)
that I suddenly woke up to her. I knew
then that if I was ever to get any money
out of that family it would be through
Chrissie. I could give Chrissie credit: she
would pay. She was mother to the other
girls—though one was older than her. The
mother was just a sloven, caring about no-
thing. Chrissie kept the others clean and
tidy, and the house, too; and she got the
money out of her mother for the bills some-
how.
“There was respect in the whole neigh-
borhood for little Chrissie. She had a kind
of passion for respectability, for herself and
her sisters ; and even the rough characters
of the neighborhood admired it in her. She
sort of grew on us. Then came the time
when she turned out a man who came to
the house. .. .Well, not exactly turned him
out.
“ ‘Aren’t you ashamed to come here?’ she
asked, standing right up to him. ‘There
are four young girls in this house, and it’s
their mother you are with. She wouldn’t
have brought you here, only she’s been drink-
ing. But you ought to think about it; you
ought to think about them and be ashamed
to stay.’
“I know, because I know the man; and
he told me he was ashamed —so ashamed
that he left.
“After that there was a considerable
straightening up in that home; but it was
hard to keep Mrs. Cripps straight. She was
one of those women who are always talking
about their love for their children and doing
nothing to show it. As if it was something
gieat and wonderful and unusual for a
woman to love her kids ! Perhaps she did
love them—in her own slovenly way.
“Directly she was 14 Chrissie left school
and got a job in a tearoom; and she got Ada,
who was older, a job there, too. The mother
had got Ada a job before, in the usual
slovenly way, as a nursemaid. Still, in spite
of her work, Chrissie was the little mother
to the others ; and kept the house in order,
and the mother, too —she needed more keep-
ing in order than the house.
“At 16 the father faded out. Just dis-
appeared, and the money he used to send
faded with him. Chrissie had to face the pro-
blem, for the money waitresses got them
days didn’t go far to keep a family. The
lodging-house idea came to her. They
couldn’t let lodgings in their old house: it
was a crazy old five-room place, pulled down
now. She had to get recommendations for
the landlord and the furniture people. She
came to me.
“She came to me,” he repeated proudly
and with a touch of softness in his voice, as
if he liked to think of it.
“I came to live here directly she started
the place; I thought it would help her, and
it was handy.
“Next she has trouble with Ada —a slum-
micky girl at 19, and prone to giggling when-
ever a boy looked at her. There was a pretty
good deal of trouble one time and another ;
but she got to learti it was likely to be
worse, and she locks Ada in her room one
night. I heard the girl banging at her door,
and I went down to see about it.
“ ‘lt’s that cat Chrissie,’ she says. ‘She’s
locked me in. She’s jealous about me having
boys. Let me out, please.’
“ ‘lf she’s locked you in it’s good enough
for you, I expect,’ I says; ‘but I’ll find her-’
“I found her on the verandah. Just as I
arrived there was a whistle in the street,
and she pounced down on the whistler. Pre-
sently he followed her into the house look-
ing sullen, and from what I heard I thought
I might put in a word.
“I walked into the room where they were.
‘Now, look here, young feller,’ I said, ‘what
Chrissie says goes in this house, and I, as
a relative of the family,, am here to back it.’
“In short, we warned him off unless he
was serious; and it was that that made him
serious. He stayed away for nearly a week;
and when he came back it was to tell us
he’s found out he really cares for Ada. They
were married later, and that was one worry
off Chrissie’s hands.
“She had a few young fellows who used to
come and see her herself; chaps she’d met
at the teashop mostly. There was one hung
on for a long time, and I wanted to break
his neck after. He was a wealthy young
galoot, and soon he is after Chrissie in
deadly earnest. One night she is as
happy as Larry, as she tells us all about it.
They’re engaged; and there is a big house
and happiness ahead of her—all that she
deserved. I felt dumped about it, not think-
ing him half good enough for her. But I
was glad to hear her singing happily about
the house. Singing about the house,” he
repeated. “You don’t picture her like that,
do you?”
“Well —no.”

To Soothe and Heal that
Skin-disease
You MUST get Zam-Buk.
Always soothe, purify and heal your skin with Zam-Buk, then you
may be sure that you are using no mere dressing or ordinary compound
of rancid animal fat and mineral poison.
Zam-Buk is a real curative balm containing the most valuable herbal
essences which Nature herself provides for the regeneration of the
human skin.
While so naturally soothing and healing, Zam-Buk also has a powerful germicidal property
that quickly removes itching irritation, inflammation and all poisonous impurity. New, healthy
skin grows in a marvellous way under the influence of Zam-Buk

everywhere.
The curative essences in Zam-Buk are so pure and so
finely distilled as to be readily absorbed to the inner
tissues, where the seat of all the worst skin disease lies.
Zam-Buk is unequalled not only for clearing away
pimples and ordinary surface eruptions, but for removing
all deep-seated troubles like eczema, ringworm, ulcers,
abscesses, etc. It is folly to experiment with crude oint-
ments and dressings, which cannot possibly do the same
good as Zam-Buk.
“Through summer my little son, Francis, had a bad
outbreak of hives on his body,” writes Mr. Francis H. Bull,
of 12 Young Street, Annandale, Sydney. “The irritation
was intense and the child scratched until he bled. This
caused inflamed sores to spread all over his body. He had
doctors’ treatment, and any number of
ointments and salves without doing
good. Then we decided on Zam-Buk. This
herbal balm seemed to subdue irritation and
inflammation like nothing else could, and it soon
drew all poisonous impurities Out of the child’s
skin; We persevered with Zam-Buk until the
sores were thoroughly-healed and the last trace
of disease had disappeared.

"But her troubles weren’t over. Freda
was the next one. She had a job as a typist,
and she was all for going out; flashing round
with tiie boss sometimes. Freda used to say
she wan ted enjoyment, and was going to get
lfc v hrissie thought it out; and then she
got Keggie to take Freda out with them to
theatres and so on.
And then it suddenly dawns upon me that
the happy singing has stopped; but I didn’t
ready guess the position until I heard
(. hrissie sobbing in her room one night. Then
I found out that Reggie was in love with the
younger sister, lie was prepared to go on.
£-V Wl c ?, n Chrissie heard, she wouldn’t think
of it. She released him. He married Freda
•soon afterwards. Chrissie had sacrificed her
happiness for her sister’s, but she kept a
calm face to the world; and only 1. who
heard her sobbing at night, knew what it
had cost her. I wanted to hear that happy
singing again, but I never did.
“Then the mother died—it was a relief,
that, 1 think. And the youngest girl. Anne,
passed through the University on a scholar-
ship, and got a classy school job. She never
comes here now—looks down on Chrissie as
commonplace.
Commonplace!" his voice rose in passion-
ate indignation. “Saved her whole family!
Let her own happiness go! A splendid
woman! If I had my way. I’d take her
away from here, give her a fine house, and
Jet her have all the pleasure that money
could buy. She deserves”
“Why don’t you?” I demanded.
, “Eh?” he cried, aghast. “Why, I would,
but but 1 couldn’t ask her! She’s broken-
hearted!”
Nonsense, I expostulated. “A woman
doesn.t remain broken-hearted for good. If
a young man has failed her, she may care for
an older one. A woman wants to be mar-
ried. I don’t wonder at a woman growing
crabby if year by year goes by" and a man
she knows loves her is ass enough to refuse
to say so. Why"——--
A tup at the door checked me; and on my
“( ome in,” Miss Cripps entered.
“Miss Cripps," I said ; "I may have been
rude this morning, and I want -to apologise.
I fancy I left my cigarettes in your sitting-
room. Do you .mind if I get them ? I’ll be
back in a minute.” I paused half-way to the
door. “M hat do you think Mr. Bolgin has
been asking me, Miss Cripps? He wanted
my advice 'on how to tell a woman lie loves
her!”
Bolgin's face flamed as he stammered a
protest, and I paused for a quiet grin out-
side the door and unavoidably heard :
"But what he says is really true, Chris-
sie”—
Then I went downstairs.
**. » #
I don’t wonder Bolgin wanted to hear
Chrissie’s "Happy singing again: she really
has a very sweet voice.
I heard it this morning.
As I remarked before, it had been my in-
tention to leave my lodgings. I now find
they are leaving me. as it were. What the
whole business proves is that one should be
careful of sweeping condemnations till the
full story has been told.
HAMER.
The Surveyor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BILL JENKINS shaded his eyes and
stared curiously down the main street
of the little North Auckland settle-
ment in which his brand new pub stood. In
the distance the sun was glinting on some
highly-polished surface, which passed the
reflection in the form of sharp flashes.
Bill retired to the bar, there to polish
glasses with an eye to business. Patrons
were wont to say that he almost resented
spoiling the shine of them. Certainly their
glitter well symbolised the almost savage
pride he took in his house.
Mr. Jenkins had only recently arrived from
England, and had put most of his capital into
the building of his hotel. And already his
name was being breezed abroad as that of a
capable and genial host.
Two or three thirsty diggers, on the tramp
to new grounds, came in, and in. the ensuing-
conversation an hour or so lazed by. Bill
now went out for another scrutiny of the
street, and this time was able to discern the
cause of the mysterious flashing. In the
middle distance a surveyor was adjusting his
tripod, while a weary-looking cliainman,
laden with the usual impedimenta, moved
forward, flag in hand. They .were coming-
nearer.
After many bearings had been taken, and
the chainman had worn a definite track
along the side of Bill’s building, a peg was
finally driven, and the workers entered the
bar. They were served , with a “long one”
each, and their host flicked imaginary flies
and remarked on the weather. But it was
not until a second refresher had chased the
first that, they became communicative!
“Goin’ far?” queried Bill.
“Oh, yes, eventually,” agreed the surveyor.
“Stayin’, p’raps? Care to book a couple
of rooms?”
“Might as well, I suppose. At any rate,
we’ll want two for to-night.”
“Have another on me?”
“Thanks,” from the surveyor.
"Dummineifidoo,” from the chainman.
“As a matter of fact,” confided he of the
theodolite, “I seem to have made a mistake
in my calculations. I,’ll have to go back
four or five miles and check.”
“Expect you for tea?”
“Yes, we’ll be in about then.”
* * * *
“Nice little place this,” volunteered the
surveyor ; '“your own ?”
“Aye.”
“H-m-m ; that’s a pity.”
Tea was over. The surveyor and his host
were smoking in the office, while the chain-
man swapped yarns with a l'ew stragglers in
the commercial-room, when this astounding
remark was made.
“It’s a pity,” repeated the surveyor.
“I don’t quite get you. Mister,” said Bill.
A long pause.
“Well, I know I shouldn’t say anything
yet, but it does seem a shame !”
“You shouldn't. It does,” agreed Bill.
“Suppose you cough it up.”
“Well, I can’t well make matters worse,
so here goes. You remember this morning
1 said I thought I had made a mistake in
one of my bearings?”.
“I do.”
“Well, I Went back and checked carefully,
but they were all right.”
“Just fancy!” sneered Mr. Jenkins, who
was fast losing his temper in face of this
mysterious preamble. His companion flushed
slightly.
“As you have probably guessed, I am a
Government surveyor, and I. find that your
hotel is seven feet out on the main road !”
“Hell!” said Bill. Just thah —“Hell!”
Only not once, or even twice, but several
times, and with growing alarm expressed in
each ejaculation. “And what’ll that mean?”
he inquired, with the return of the capacity
for consecutive speech.
“You’ll have, to move back. That's all.”
“Move back ! How the blazes can I move
back? I’m not a blarsted lobster.”
“Don’t blame me. I didn’t build the
place.”
“Sorry.”
Another long interval.
“This will just about break me. The
show’s mortgaged as it is, and it'd cost
another hundred and fifty to make that altera-
tion. All I’ve got is about fifty. To Hell
with you and your instruments !”
“I’m sorry I told you.' * Dam’ sorry. I
think I’ll get off to bed now. Good n— —”
“Hold on, chum! You don’t seem to
realise”-
The cause of tile trouble resumed his seat.
“No chance of you having made a niis-
take?” suggested Mr. Jenkins.
“Impossible! You see, I w r ent back and
checked !”
“But don’t you think you may have made
one?” •
“You don’t seem to understand”
“Do you think you could, make a mis-
take?” -o
“I’ve never made-one, yet!” ,
“Oh, it’s you as don’t understand !" cried,
Jenkins passionately. “Look here, I don’t
know 7 as how 7 I know much about this coun-
try, but there’s one thing is fairly w T ell knowm
wherever you be, and that is ‘money talks.’
What I want to get at is what sort of a,
record I’d have to put on to "talk you into
findin’ you had made- a •mistake?”
“Again, impossible!” returned the other.
“Why' it would mean I’d have to go back
over, a week’s wvork l”
Bill went to the safe, unlocked it, took
out ten five-pound notes and put them on the
table. ' ,
“If ye take that and ‘all’s well,’ I can
carry on here. If ye leave.it it’ll only go
to the mortgagees-r-unless I hop it.”
The official- seemed to hesitate. Fifty
pounds was—well, it was fifty pounds ex-
actly.
,“It would mean weeks of work,” he
mused, “altering all the readings and bear-
ings so minutely.... Look here, I’ll go up
to my room and think it over. I’ll be down
in half an hour.”
It was nearly an hour before he returned.
“I’m running a terrible risk in doing this,
but I’ll chan.ee it,” was his verdict.
“You’re a sport!” cried Bill, and reached
for his hand.
They shook.
“Mind you,” said the surveyor, .“I trust
you to keep your mouth shut!”
“It would be silly of me not to, wouldn't
it?”
"That’s true. And now, as a guarantee
of good faith. I’ll burn my plans, field-books
and all, before your eyes. ■ I won’t: be able
to change my mind then.”
A bundle of neatly-tied-up blue-prints and
several field-books were soon blazing in the
office fire.
“There, that’s' done!”-
“And there, that’s done too!” said Bill,
counting over the ten fivers.
“Well. I’ll have to head for Auckland to-
morrow to start fixing things at head-
quarters, so I reckon I’ll retire now,”-smiled
the official.
Ilis host detained him while elbows were
bent in mutual acknowledgment; - Alien
pocketing the notes he bade Bill a smiling
“Good-night.”
When Bill arose next morning his bene-
factor had gone, but his theodolite and im-
pedimenta stood in the hall. A week passed
quietly, and a small portion of the 50 pounds
was restored to the safe. It was on the
eighth day that Bill came in from a short
stroll to find a well-dressed man carrying
on like a maniac in the hall. Seizing Bill
by the arm, he dragged him up to the theo-
dolite.
“By the asbestos tails of 17 devils, can
you tell me. how that got there?”
"Faint recollection that I put it there
myself. And,- say, would r you like a piece
of wood bo hang on to? It’s harder than
my arm!”
“You put it there!” gasped the .'stranger,
relaxing his grip in amazement.
“I did.”
“Why, I’ve been hunting for that since
yesterday, when I came back to my hut and
found it had been burgled. Instruments all
gone ! Even my working clothes . had been
pinched!” .
“The chap that did it is probably a friend
of yours. • Surveyor chap, Government man ;
round here about a week ago, surveying the
road.”
“Be damned ! The- road was surveyed a
month before this.building was,started, and
there isn’t .another surveyor within 50 miles.
Don’t, look at me like that, man! Curse it!
Do you think I don’t know my-own job?”
But Mr. Jenkins was not listening any
more. A great light was dawning on Ins
brain, and the thought of the -intolerable
wrong that had been done him excluded all
else. _■
