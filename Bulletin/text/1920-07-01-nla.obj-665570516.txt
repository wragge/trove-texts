Guarding the
Nation’s Industries
The business man is now realising more than ever
that the Oxy-Acetylene Process is the life of industry.
It is one of the strong supports of production because it helps to
keep industrial plants and vehicles of transport in continuous op-
eration. There is no class of machinery that will stand continuous
wear for ever. Day after day factories in every part of Australia
suffer from machinery breakdowns, but because they know the val-
ue of the Oxy-Acetylene Welding Process the hold-up is not of long
duration. Oxy-Acetylene Welders can be found in every part of Aus-
tralia, ready at all times to make broken machinery parts, tools, and even
metal household utensils strong as new for a trifle compared with the cost
of replacement. Full particulars regarding Comox Welding and Cutting
Outfits, or the address of your local Welder, will be mailed on request.

be asked to buy other jujubes, and be told
they are “just as good" as Hudson’s Eumen-

The Red Page
Nathaniel v. Charles
When first I tried to read Nathaniel Haw-
thorne 1 was 13, and suffering from a surfeit
of Charles- Dickens. I had literally gorged
on “Barnaby Rudge,” “Little Dorrit,”
“David Copper-field,” “Nicholas Nickleby”
and the others, one down the other come
on, and I took “The Scarlet Letter” in
hand, feverish with expectation, having
heard the book much talked about. The
American was a bitter disappointment to a
mind given over to the cruder realities of
Old Curiosity Shop.” I simply could
not wade through its tedious truth. To a
palate the Englishman had accustomed to
highly-seasoned and most piquant relishes,
this American’s plain fare was detestable.
.1 burled “The Scarlet Letter” into my
literary lumber-room, and went back greedily
to “Martin Chuzzlewit” and “Bleak House.”
The other day I made an effort to read
Dickens again, taking on “Dombey and
Sou,” a book I had missed by some chance
in my youthful voracity. To my great sur-
prise I found I had no longer any stomach
for Dickens. I tried “The Old Curiosity
Shop” over again, and found it something
like a weariness of the flesh. Chance brought
“The Scarlet Letter” to my hand once more.
I dipped in, and presently found myself
reading with a curious aud healthy absorp-
tion. The result was a complete revolution
of old concepts. The book I had deemed
ancient and humdrum I found to be pecu-
liarly modern; the books that had seemed
so fresh and vivacious, so deliciously young,
.were now old past bearing. The artifice of
Dickens stuck out on every page; the art
of Hawthorne, severely restrained, shone as
an outstanding example of that true art
which conceals art.
Charles and Nathaniel were contempo-
raries. “The Old Curiosity Shop” was written
in 1840, “The Scarlet Letter” in 1850. The
former could not have been written at any
time within the last 20 years, whereas the
latter might be of to-day, to-morrow, given
the man of genius; but to-day, as in their
own day, I have no doubt Dickens has 20
readers to Hawthorne’s one. Yet Hawthorne
is far more a man Of the moment. “The
Scarlet Letter’s” restraint is exemplified in
its length, a matter of some 76,000 words,
where a Dickens novel will be found to run
to at least three times that number. Where
Hawthorne tells a story, Dickens gives a
history of a community. There is scarcely
a vestige of the author of “The Old
Curiosity Shop” in the make-up of the good-
t\ype novel of the present day, whereas the
author of “The Scarlet Letter” might easily
have been the loved exemplar of a dozen of
our better and best living novelists.
Hawthorne’s story is a route march,
Dickens’s a ramble. Where Hawthorne’s
characters have pulsing vitality, in Dickens’s
the marionet is too often only lightly covered
with a specious appearance of flesh and
blood. In nothing is the widely-varying
styles of the two men so manifest as in
their treatment of children. Little Nell,
Poor Jo, the Marchioness —these are created
in accordance with definite formulas.
Dickens has two notes for each, the humor-
ous and the pathetic, 'fou see him pulling
his stops. The emotion is turned on as with
a tap, and - the characterisation owes much
to catch words. Dickens gags desperately ;
nine out of 10 of his characters have their
shibboleths, and when he has done with
any one of them you feel you have been in
company with an emblem rather than a flesb-
and-blood creature —-a very vivid and signifi-
cant emblem perhaps, but not an actuality
of God. On the other hand the child Pearl,
Hester Payne’s daughter, has in her the
wonderful grace, the beauty, the winsome-
ness, the wickedness, the tremendous energy
of youth. Something of' every healthy,
spirited child you have ever known glows
in this impish sprite. Her wilfulness, her
precocity, her strain of uncanniness ring
true. She is, it seems to me, the most virile
and genuine child in all fiction.
Nathaniel’s Roger Chillingworth is a type
Charles might have handled with gusto, but
we may look to Quilp to get an understand-
ing of the different treatment Charles would
have accorded to this terrible hate. Chilling-
worth is a tremendous figure; liis passion is
woven into his very fibre; he moves through
the book with the significance of Fate. Con-
rider the quiet impressiveness of the
wearer of the Scarlet Letter. In Dickens’s
extensive gallery of female paintings is there
anything to equal this wonderful piece of
portraiture? Dickens, too, has his woman
with the Scarlet Letter,. Rose Dartle, with
her scar, but she is a piece of melodrama
of the two penny-colored type compared with
Hester.
“The Scarlet Letter” should be read with-
out its preface. No work of fiction had
ever less need of a preface: none I know «f
—not even a B. Shaw play-book—presents
a longer. The book tells its own story so
thoroughly that a 60-page disquisition on the
moment, the men and the manners is a task
of supererogation. This vigorous book has
perennially young blood, it helps one to a
more respectful attitude towards American
literature. It is as quick and vivid to the
artistic reader as Dickens seems to be to
the superficial.
EDWARD DYSON.
The Satirist, New and Old
If Galsworthy and Shaw could use any-
thing like the,license of a century ago, we
might have some fun in the papers. A man
has to go delicately now in print; it may
cost him big money to speak his mind.
Byron’s
Spread, spread for Vitellius the royal repast,
Till the gluttonous despot -be stuff’d to the gorge!
And the roar of his drunkards proclaim him at last
The fourth of the fools and oppressors call’d George 1
written of a reigning monarch to-day would
cause considerable unpleasantness for Byron,
whether the lines were published in Italy
or Timbuctoo. The narrowness of the liter-
ary area was probably the cause of the habit
of direct abuse and of the occasionally just-
as-direct praise. A man’s friends put him
in the pillory in perfectly good faith, while
they sharpened their pens and went for him.
That was all right; he only waited until
they had finished and his turn came round
to answer back. It was all in the game
played by the comparatively small family
of educated people who were writers and
ln their artificial code it would
have been grossly bad manners, resulting in
complete ostracism, to bring family matters
into a court for the sake of a money-balm
for injured feelings. For these and other
reasons the old walloping satire was a popu-
lar form of literary expression; some in-
stance of it was expected of a man of let-
ters. If he failed in his assumed duty of
being witty at the expense of his friends the
inference was that lie was afraid of them,
which established quite unfairly his cur-
rent literary position.
It was a good game while it lasted, but
it lasted long enough. Dryden, Pope, Defoe,
Swift, Buckingham in his forgotten "Apol-
lo’s Feast” —even Byron, the most inspired
hard-hkter of the lot —could have got only
the same momentary pleasure as the readers
out of the habit. If you “have it in” for
a man and get your chance of calling him
a liar Jtnd a sot, having done so isn’t that
about the end of it? However delicately and
wittily it is done, it seems to me that abuse
rises, expresses itself, and is gone with
the burst of anger or conceit in which it
was born. Apd isn’t the essentially tran-
sient thing essentially valuoless?
Charity is more necessary in the literary
mind than it is in life. Unless a man has
a kindly heart, open for all impressions and
fair in all judgments, his thoughts are not
worth putting on paper. The personal satire
habit of the IStli and 19th centuries did not
destroy the writers’ minds because no par-
ticular enmity was intended ior felt' in the
interchange of abuse. The thing was not
as cruel to them as it reads to us; it was
artificial, and as such I think it was
negligible. The club dinner at the St.
James’s at which Garrick shot his epito-
mised, threadbare critique of Goldsmith :
Here lies Nolly Goldsmith, for shortness called Noll,
Who wrote like an angel, but talked like poor Poll,
was the birthplace of “Retaliation,” the best
of the period’s examples. “Retaliation” is
not abuse; it is a kindly rapping of the
knuckles of famous men, as friendly and
true as Garrick’s epitaph. It is the friend-
liness that lifted it to fame, not the poison
in the wit.
To-day we throw mud at manners rather
than at men. For one thing, we can’t afford
the old game; for another, our age is less
artificial; and for a third, we can all read
—there is no ring of bucks and lords and
bloods carrying literature in their pockets.
The world is the reading public. Further-
more, the Petersham man is not interested
in Harry Lawson’s method of doing his hair
or b’S brand of port ; scintillating fun poked
at Dennis’s manner of getting into a cub
Would be tedious. The family has grown
too big; it has grown up, also, and out of
its parlor games. Thackeray was the origi-
nator of the truer, wider method. Satire
was in its. true place looking obliquely at
manners and abuses; it had a chance of do-
ing something in the world again, as it had
in Rome. Generally speaking, manners are
more important than men. The Fleet Prison
was bad manners; so was Sairey Gamp; so
is the injustice which “Justice” snaps its
fine finger at. “The Book of Snobs” above
and below stairs was badly needed.
Lowell’s “Fable for Critics” is the best
example of the old style and the best argu-
ment for charity. Written in the metre of
“Retaliation,” it is informed with the same
genial spirit. No man mentioned could take
exception to its treatment of him—could do
other than be glad of his inclusion. For the
rest, Shaw plays the game best for us. Later
on. when we are dead, they will 'write up
Shaw as tb" man who wrenched the 20th
century back *o normal. It will be a lie,
but there will be a dim, potential truth in it.
FRANGIS BRIEN.
What is a Gentleman?
“A gentleman, in his opinion, was a man neither
directly nor indirectly connected with trade.” —From
“Whitewash,” by H. Annesley Vachell.
As recently as, say, the end of last cen-
tury this was a matter for serious debate
in most Anglo-Saxon communities. The
assertion of Burns about a man being a
man “for a’ that” was regarded pityingly
as the frantic and futile cry of one socially
damned from birth. To be a gentleman con-
doned practically everything; not to be one
was the unforgivable sin. Everyone is a
gentleman in the sight of somebody, nowa-
days ; but there still remain innumerable
standards. When Lord Dudley was here as
Governor-General he used to talk about the
strange men in check suits and shooting-
boots who trooped into the House of Lords
to vote on the Asquith Home Rule Bill. To
him they were boors, though no doubt they
led Society in parts of Britain remote from
Westminster. On the other hand, there was
an elderly squatter in N. S. Wales who
refused to know Dudley as persistently as
he (the squatter) dropped his “h’s.” The
nobleman was suspected of having committed
some youthful folly or other on a visit to
Sydney 30 years earlier, and the pastoral-
ist had never forgotten it. The most widely
accepted standard is probably that of the
class to which Vachell belongs: he comes of
an English county family, and is a product
of Harrow and the Rifle Brigade.
What is the code of the man who has been
educated at an English public school? Set-
ting aside the exceptions—morally elevated
characters who are to be found in all ranks
—and disqualifying the humbugs who imag-
ine that they set a halo on their own heads
by representing the world as more virtuous
than it is, the case may be stated as follows.
A gentleman is permitted to get drunk. But
he must do it “like a gentleman,” as the say-
ing goes. That is to say, he must not get
sick (in public), or become abusive, or
maudlin, or vain-glorious, or otherwise offen-
sive to his friends. The wine clubs of the
great Universities, where in pre-war days
hundreds succumbed every week of term-
time, were approved by the authorities be-
cause they taught their members this im-
portant art. It is necessary to pay card-

The great majority of Farmers, Orchardists, and
others to-day are allowing Thistles, Sorrel, Couch
Grass, and a hundred other pests to shade, choke,
and crowd out useful plants and grasses, allowing
them to absorb the soil moisture, rob the plant
food in the ground, increase the cost of every opera-
tion in the preparing of the land, in the seeding,
cultivating, harvesting, and marketing of their
crops. In short, they’re Weed Farming.
Blackberries, Boxthorn, St. John’s Wort, and Rag-
wort are in undisputed possession of thousands
of acres of valuable country, mostly because their
eradication is considered impossible or
too laborious.
But, is their extermination impossible?
Not a bit of it, Mr. Landholder! Granted
you have used every conceivable means in
vain—have you ever used
"VALLO” Weed, Scrub
and Tree Killer ?
Have you heard that in all parts of
Australia “Vallo” has effectively killed
every kind of Noxious Growth to which
it has been applied—Blackberries, Box-
thorn, St. John’s Wort all included ?
“Vallo” is the easiest, handiest, and most
economical Weed, Scrub, and Tree Killer
procurable. It’s in powder form, very
soluble, and is used as a spray.

A Toast.
Somebody called for a toast to-night;
And down the tables’ line,
Past the roses and music light,
Your challenging eyes met mine.
The room grew hushed, and the lights
burned low,
And nobody saw save me
That a ghost had flooded the dark—and oh!
What tears had its eyes for me!
It went its ways ere the lights went up
And our frozen glances met.
Our gay host cried, “Let us drain the cup”;
And I fancied your eyes were wet.
Our host he bowed to the women fair,
“Let our toast be Love,” he said.
We two raised ours with the others there
And silently drank—to the Dead.

Fairy Folk.
When I am all alone
By lake or hill or sea, ■
I go searching near and far,
Under moon or sun or star,
For the little fairy-folk
Of the Old Countree.
Though I know they’re all about,
Yet they hide themselves from me,
For a secret folk are they
At their wonder-work and play-r-
They the little fairy-folk
Of the Old Countree.
Can it be that they are one
With the butterfly and bee,
With the dewdrop, bright and brief,
And the dancing blade and leaf—
They the little fairy-folk
Of the Old Countree?
Down about me falls a veil
Dimming that which I would see,
But it was not so, I wist,
When through greying rain and mist,
They were mine to know and greet
In the Old Countree.
There’s a gate I may not ope
Since I have lost the key,
’Tis the gate of dim Romance.
Where they sing and court and dance—
They the little fairy-folk
Of the Old Countree.

Rain after Drought.
As I went down by the sweet, green way
’Mid the mirth and the scents and the young
June day,
I heard a voice of an olden time
Singing high, singing low, to a love-sick
rhyme.
The delicate dawn on milk-white feet
Came trip, trip, trip, to a magic beat.
Oh, I dared not breathe lest the spell should
break,
And my heart stop dead for a wild dream’s
sake.
“Is it Love,” I said, “that is singing high!'
Is it fairy elves in the merry sky?”
And over and over and over again
The ljttle leaves answered, “Rain, rain, rain.”

high,
And the perfection of that loneliness.”

Light Elusive.
A little farther down the road
A glittering lures my will,
A vague shy gleam that eoyly showed
Before I topped the hill.
Where sweet the whispering river flowed,
Where wind-swept crags were chill,
And where by flowery ways I strode,
That gleaming called me still
A little farther down the road.
And so Igo from day to day
Still eager in the chase,
Straining to hear some half-guessed lay,
Panting to see some face
Divinely different, pensive, gay...,
Ah, me, till I embrace
My dream oft-glimpsed I cannot stay
At peace in any place.
And so Igo from day to day.
The light elusive cries to me
And will not let me rest,
When clear and near it seems to be
It burns within my breast.
I’ve had my fill of grief and glee,
I’ve had (be it confest)
My days of shame and jeopardy;
And yet—so is one blest!—
The light elusive cries to me.
It shines as always it has shone,
It glows as it has glowed.
And still it calls me, calls me on
A little farther down the road!

THURSDAY, JULY 1, 1920.
A DEAD ARMY.
Never in history have fighting-men been
treated so well after a war as most of those
who made up the AXIS'. Governments and
nine-tenths of the public have competed
with one another to do them honor. The
ancient policy of the employing class in
regard to returned soldiers, which Kipling
crystallised bitterly 20 years ago in the
phrase “Kick him out, the brute!” is not
merely unfashionable with us; it is illegal.
The nation has been so anxious to keep all
its pledges that the wasters who get into
every army—the lead-swingers, the men
who wore uniforms but resolutely avoided
the fighting-line, and the plain criminals —
have had unparalleled chances to acquire
credit and profit. The quarters in w’hich
the good men of the A.I.F. are regarded
coldly may be counted easily on the fingers
of one -hand, and it is a paradoxical fact
that the most conspicuous of them is the
Army. *
* * * *
Hundreds of civilians proved themselves
in the stern and ceaseless competition of
war to be born soldiers and leaders.
Monash, Hobbs, Rosenthal. Gellibrand,
Herring, Cannan and a small army of
colonels and majors are How back in their
civil occupations, despite the expressed wish
of many of them for some form of military
employment, with the result that practically
the whole sum of their capacity and experi-
ence looks like being lost to the country. The
damage done by the shelving of these men
is. anyhow, negative: the nation is in no
worse position than an impresario who,
after going to the expense of training a
likely tenor, sees him go abroad. The posi-
tive damage is a matter of the treatment of
another class —the junior officers, n.e.o’s
and men of the Permanent Forces who
under the delusion that a professional soldier
is expected to fight, pushed their way to
the front. In about 99 per cent, of cases
they have come back to the ranks with
which, they left, and, worse, to the pay
_with which they left. The Assistant-Min-
ister for Defence stated in the House of
Representatives the other day that all mem-
bers of the permanent forces had been
given an increase of “from 40 to 80 per cent
on pre-war rates” to balance the higher cost
or living. In the case of the lower ranks
it simply isn’t true. Here is the position
of some of them, as set out in Finance
General Memorandum No. 332, latelv issued
by the Department of Defence :
, . New Rate. Old Rate.
Captain . . . . £4OO-—5-25 £375—450
Lieutenant.. .. 250—375 250—350
Warrant-officer .. 234—299 210 —285
In none of these cases is there a 40 per
cent, rise, and in none of them is there a
rise worth mentioning, except in the maxi-
mum rate, which is hardly ever reached
under the ingenious increment arrangement
m vogue. And included in the above classes
are pretty well all the junior officers and
men of the Permanent Army who enlisted
in the A.I.F.
* * * »
Duntroon graduates who returned to Aus-
tralia with the rank of major (it having been
laid down that they might rise no higher),
and with the commendations of every good
judge who viewed their work in the line,
are now supervising the drill of C.M.F.
trainees at approximately £6 a week. They
are more fortunate than many who were
their seniors on the field of battle. Lieut.-
Colonel Ordish, C.M.G., D. 5.0., is now a
W.O. on the Instructional Staff; Lieut.
Colonel McClean, D.S.O. and bar, is a W. 0.,
R.A.G.A.; Lieut.-Colonel Marsden, D.S.O.
and bar, is a W.O. on the Instructional
Staff, and so is Major Steele, D. 5.0., D.C.M.
Captain Newland, V.C., (12th Battalion), is
a temporary 5.0., due to revert to W.O.
Class 11,. when the period of his appoint-
ment expires. Other officers who rose from
the ranks of the A.I.F. became adjutants or
staff-officers, and won decorations for specific
acts of gallantry, are now holding positions
inferior even to any of the above. The
records of all of them are spotless. No one
would dare to question their efficiency. Why
are they, the thoroughbreds of the service,
being kept in the cart-horse jobs?
It is a matter partly of what W. H.
Kelly, ex-M.P., who had plenty of chances
to judge and who was anything but a revo-
lutionary, termed recently “the military
clique.” Consider the composition of the
Military Board in relation to its possibilities
in the way of enthusiasm for the fighting
men of the A.I.F. Major-General Sellheim
left Australia with the Ist Division, but re-
turned to Australia at an early stage of the
proceedings. So also did Brig.-General
Fors%th. As a matter of fact, the only
member of the Board who saw the war
through is Major-General White. Although
Lieut-General Chatjvel is Inspector-General
he has not a seat on the Board ; and Brig.-
General Coxen, whose war-services were as
long as they were excellent, has now sub-
sided into a sort of understudy to Forsyth
without a seat on the Board. In the mass
such a body is not likely to battle for the
fighting soldier as against the office type, to
which class they themselves more or less
belong, and the members of which class, in
Australia, have had unique opportunities to
“dig in” to their friendship and esteem.
Apart from which the system is too strong
for them. And, in the light of modern ideas,
what an imbecile system it is! It is Prus-
sianism with none of Prussianism’s virtues.
It is caste without prestige. A frail shell
painted to look like discipline. It is said
that at one barracks a majority of the men
refuse to salute their officers, many of
whom have never been outside Australia,
but very punctiliously salute an n.e.o. who
rose to high rank in the A.1.F.! Such a
position may or may not exist, but that the
feeling calculated to give rise to it exists
very widely is notorious. Because our present
out-of-date system makes no provision for the
recognition of merit, because it gives full
play to political wire-pulling in high places,
while making anything of the sort a court-
martial offence in the case of the humbler
ranks, and because of the wretched pay that
the junior members of the service have to
put up with to counterbalance the remu-
neration of . their seniors who have the ears
of the politicians—because of these amongst
other things, the permanent forces are in
a rotten state. Superficially the army is
disciplined. The men are clean; they know
their drill; and they can provide effective-
looking guards and piquets. Bqt of the
discipline that the A.I.F. knew, which is
the only sort of value for present-day pur-
poses, they know nothing. Younger mem-
bers are employing 25 per cent, of their
energies in grousing, 25 per cent, in seek-
ing openings in civil life, and the remaining
50 per cent, in doing more or less listlessly
the duties for which they are responsible.
Older men are likewise employing 25 per
cent, of their energies in grousing, 25 per
cent, in regretting that they are too old for
civil life and 50 per cent, in doing just
enough to escape rebuke! They feel no
enthusiasm, and in consequence they inspire
none. They are part of an elaborate sham
whose hollowness was exposed when Ger-
many, where it came from, fell; and they see
no prospect of its being converted into a
reality in their day.
* * * *
For like reasons at a critical period of
the late war the R.N. was on the verge
of mutiny. At a time when unionists on
shore were paying taxes on incomes of £6OO,
£7OO and even £lOOO per annum naval
A.B.’s were drawing Is. sd. a day. The
odds against a lower-deck rating becoming
anything more than a w.o. were many
thousands to one. By successive strokes of
the pen the R.N. was democratised (more
or less), the pay was raised of classes that
had known nothing of the sort for a couple
of centuries, and the humanising influence
of. Welfare Committees was introduced. No-
thing less will save Australia’s Permanent
Army from, destruction—destruction not so
much by violence as by inanition and slow
decay. The injustice and the folly of push-
ing the experts who have seen service into
inferior positions, and of giving preference
to those who did their soldiering at home.
are symptomatic. To the conservative mili-
tary mind they seem wise and just courses
for no better reason than that equality of
opportunity, and the recognition of merit by
the gift of high rank, irrespective of class,
were considered heretical in Frederick the
Great’s day. Those who compose the pre-
sent Military Board (good men though they
all are in their special lines) are not likely
to move, nor are the members of any con-
ceivable Military Board of the future. It
is a question to be tackled in Parliament
by those soldier-members who in the hard
field of experience learned the difference be-
tween the soldiering methods of to-day and
those of an era which is dead. And the
subject is urgent inasmuch as conditions in
the Permanent Army are already reacting
disastrously on the efficiency of the Citizen
Forces.
HORSE PROHIBITION v. BEER
PROHIBITION.
Deab Bulletin. —Prohibition, in its most
obvious aspect, is the art of falling like a
cataract of bricks on the other fellow’s
alleged sin for the alleged or presumed
benefit of this fellow’s soul,, if he has one.
It is the art also of penalising the habit or
business of the minority, the minority being
an easy mark, and it is a money-making job
in the right hands. The merits of the case
have little to do with it; but it must be some-
thing big enough to make the fuss and the
collection-plate a long one, yet not so big
that the matter will be laughed out of
court as impossible or so universal that
there will be no audience to support the
collection-plate. Partly owing to some of
these reasons, and possibly to other reasons,
and partly through lack of originality, the
prohibitionist sticks close to his anti-liquor
text and doesn’t include, say, football or
horse-racing in his litany of vituperation.
Yet the last would be a good enough topic.
It isn’t really a sport any more than was
the effeminate and sedentary habit of sitting
in the amphitheatre and watching the pro-
fessional gladiator. The.crdwd doesn’t play,
and doesn’t want to play, and never ■ expects
to play, not having the. necessary horse or
bag or license. _ The handful of players
aren’t fine physical specimens of their sort
as the gladiator was. The jockey is
generally stunted. The bookmaker is too
fat. The horse is worth comparatively little
save for this special and worthless business,
though of course he may retire to the stud
and sire pampered machines of his own sort.
The dishonesty of _ the whole affair is
notorious, so infuriated committees are
always inquiring into things. If their
powers covered a wider range, including the
reasons why owners scratch well-backed
horses pnd don’t give the punter a run for
his money, and other happenings off the
course, they would inquire into a lot more
things. Intellectually the professors of
horse-racing are a poor lot, and even those
who write about it are mediocre. The men-
tal calibre of sporting writers had one
conspicuous evidence in the pathetic stodgb
of Nat Gould, and the low mental plane
of the horsey multitude is evidenced by the
rush to purchase Nat’s stodge.
* * » *
Horse-racing lives in a diseased atmos-
phere of its own. Except that it has some
possibilities as a clothes parade, it is a gamb-
ling institution pure and simple. Its exist-
ence apart from betting is quite unthinkable,
so no one has taken the trouble to think of
it or to write about it either. If any horsey
dramatist ever staged a perfectly honest and
perfectly sporting race-event—one that
wasn’t steeped in villainy and sordid cash
considerations—it has probably been forgot-
ten. Apart from the gambling element
hardly anyone cares which horse wins, or
whether no horse wins, or the whole lot of
horses win. About per cent, of embez-
zlers aver that they lost the proceeds of their
’bezzle on the course; in fact, that but for
it they would have remained respectable to
the end of the chapter. And probably 95
per cent, are speaking the truth. Certainly
the number who bring evidence that they
rashly backed a gold-mining tip and lost in
the dishonest effort to promote an honest
productive industry is infinitesimal; yet a
gold-mine is so much the more respectable
excuse that the defendant would naturally
prefer it. One possible reason is that share-
brokers are more careful than bookmakers
about accepting what they suspect to be
stolen money. On the other hand, any
politician who has put the bribes too con-
spicuously in the bank, and who has sudden
affluence to account for, always says he had
phenomenal luck at the races. Even if he
hires a bookmaker to corroborate the tale
no one believes him. The odor of lying and
corruption attached to the business is too
thick. Racing, as well as being a game based
on professionalism, is based on capitalism,
and both are of a joyless grown-up variety.
The suburban juvenile football or cricket
club, which has a few shillings’ worth of
assets and meets on a vacant allotment, may
be vociferous and untidy, but it is evidence
that cricket and football are healthy demo-
cratic games for the million. The corres-
ponding race club is impossible. The share
which joCund, impecunious youth has in that
game consists in betting odd coppers with
some petty tobacconist who runs his unlaw-
ful business under the eye of a corrupted
policeman, or doing trade with a surreptitious,
ignorant, loafing, non-productive and gener-
ally blasphemous pavement tout. The publi-
can in almost every case rigidly bars infant
customers, so apart from the smoking of
“fags” (which is only a modest vice), the
horse-racing habit supplies the small boy
with almost his only early road to the Devil.
Betting-shops are very numerous and very
undisguised, and policemen who must have
some reason for not knowing about them
are very numerous also. The swindle that
supports so many parasites must be very
large. There is no other stench like it for
comprehensiveness and widespreadness. In-
cidentally, many a man gets drunk because
he has been racing, but very few men go
racing because they are or have been drunk.
That is the difference between a double-
barrelled sin and a sin with only one barrel.
Horse-racing—or rather horse-gambling,
because the race itself is no more important
than the extempore effort of two dogs to see
the same cat safely round the corner —is the
only national vice which leads to long, fre-
quent and expensive stoppages of work.
Every town worth calling one has its recog-
nised race-days, though not its drink days
or two-up days or days set apart for pro-
fanity. The business takes up an absurd
amount of valuable space, which lies idle
most of the time. There is room for about
100,000 poker games on one big racecourse.
It is absurdly fussy. A supreme horse-event
is heralded by months of morbid excitement,
dull but heated conversation interspersed
with blanky, and much tangled finance, and
in the end it lasts 31 minutes. Not all the
other subjects under the sun lead to so much
dull conversation or raise such a crop of
mental cripples as racing; in fact, it pro-
duces a vast herd of young men who can
talk of nothing else. It has interrupted their
education and stunted their faculties until
they are unfit to be trusted with a vote or
the care of a teething infant. Yet they
are not a specially cheerful-looking species.
Rather they seem possessed of a joyless
hobby or a bleak devil. The average racing
crowd may look feverish, excited, flushed,
heated, galvanic, hurried or anxious, but
it has none of the abandon of a Latin mob
with a mere two francs in its pocket on a
carnival day. At the end it usually looks
mad, thirsty and quarrelsome more than
anything else. Despite its seeming gregari-
ousness horse-gambling is a solitary kind of
iniquity. The drinking evil is at least
accompanied and partially redeemed by
board and lodging (in fact, the drink profits go
in part to cheapen the board and lodging),
but the other evil isn’t redeemed in any way
whatever. A certain class of men who com-
bine horse with more or less attention to
public affairs haven’t been an unmixed bless-
ing to public affairs. Such names as those
of W. N. Willis, W. P. Crick and
Wren of the wonderful tote here suggest
themselves. (This is saying nothing of
three Ministers who were once racecourse
wheel-of-fortune men, one pony-owning
Minister and a Minister who was in gaol for
stealing a horse.) One way and another I
think a better case may be made out for
racehorse prohibition than for drink pro-
hibition. —Yours, etc., Henry Horsecollar.
AN OCEAN OF PAPER.
At Naples we entered into starving Europe.
But there were few beggars in the gateway.
It seemed to us that if Italy was starving
she hid her anguish well. The streets were
full of well-dressed men and women, the
cafes full of wine and food and laughter,
the marble-fronted butchers’ shops hung
with huge carcases like offerings to a lusty
pagan deity. Signs of the late war, in
which Italy lost 600,000 of her manhood,
only appeared in an occasional mendicant
carrying the tatters of a uniform about him,
and in the deep mourning of many of the
women. Khaki has disappeared, and in its
place returns the dandy officer clad in the
rainbow hues of peace, with azure cloaks
like Roman togas and stripes three inches
wide of orange, red and blue.
But the first impression of general well-
being quickly fades. Naples is full of sol-
diers driving motor transports like thunder-
ing juggernauts through the narrow streets,
camping in the piazzas or supporting with
bayonets the white-gloved gendarmes. They
give an effect of violent energy to a scene
whose dominant character reflected in the
drifting crowds and pitiful food queues is
one of listlessness and low morale. The big
railway strike has just been settled with
machine-guns. A strike amongst the shop-
assistants has spread to the steel-workers,
and there has been some shooting. To-day
there is a general strike as a protest against
the shooting and to commemorate the dead.
Strikes are endemic. The street-cleaners,
as the result of a successful strike, have just
had their wages raised to the equivalent of
14s. a day—they got about ninepence before
the war. Wages in some trades have soared
to giddy and fantastic heights, where the
conservative mind reels in following, But
their flight is a blundering one compared
with the graceful upward sweep of the Cost
of Living. Coke, which in the cities is most
used for heating and cooking, cost 335. a
ton before the war. It is now £25. Bread
costs three times, butter four times, meat
five times more than they did. Eggs, in old
days a shilling a dozen, are now lOd. each.
Suits which *vere £5 are now £35. A Gov-
ernment, not otherwhere over-wise, has kept
the cost of the national dish within reason-
able limits, and macaroni has only doubled
in price. Rents are now fixed.
And yet, supplied with English money, we
find it cheaper to live in Naples than in
Australia. A half-hour carriage drive costs
us less than ninepence, and we may get a
safety-razor for a shilling while the ladies
are buying six-guinea hand-embroidered
blouses for 30s. and silk stockiqgs for Bs.
Moderately good hotels are to be found at
ss. a day and pensions at 3s.
This seems a great mystery. Its key is
exchange. Exchange itself is a great mys-
tery, but let us not inquire too far into it.
It is _ sufficient for us that for the credit
established with each of our Australian
notes we receive, doled out by a reluctant
official as if he were measuring out his
country’s life-blood, incredible quantities of
Italian paper. There are filthy little notes
for one lira, worth less than threepence, and
enormous parchment certificates for a thou-
sand lire, worth about £l2. For £5 we are
stuffed like a wadded quilt; with £6O worth
we are freighted below our Plimsoll. If an
ungrateful Mother Country had allowed us
to bring gold we would have been .submerged.
Certainly this paper melts like snow
upon the desert’s dusty face. An average
meal in a caf6 makes as big a gap in your
stationery as it leaves a void in your sto-
mach. The church-door beggar sends rich
curses after you if you give him copper in-
stead of paper. What looks and feels to
you like a penny is worth only a farthing,
and it requires 15 one-cent pieces to make
the value of a half-penny. You feel at first
your thousand lire must float you down the
stream of time for ever. You are quickly
-disenchanted.
Still, you are infinitely better off than the
native. That mysterious but omnipotent
deity, the rate of exchange for the day,


miraculously turns your pound into three
pounds, and with regal munificence flings you
a few shillings over. The H. C, of L. has
no terrors for you. But the native enjoys
no such supernatural largesse. His wages
may have trebled, but the cost of living
has quadrupled, while his tenpenny lira is
worth less than threepence when he is forced
to buy in England, and about twopence half-
penny if he wants to buy in U.S.A. His
currency fluctuates so rapidly that in terms
of foreign exchange he may' be a rich man
one day and a comparative beggar the next.
In a recent week the exchange varied from
72 to 90, then leapt to 103 (general strike
in Tuscany j', dropped to 94 and 83 (optimis-
tic speech by Finance Minister in Parlia-
ment) and rose again to 93 (general strike
in Turin). It is the same as if our Com-
monwealth Bank one-pound notes would buy
us ss. worth of some foreign necessity.
Only when the Italian merchant turns to
Germany does he find a country so much
worse off than his own that the rate of
exchange is turned in his favor. The depre-
ciated lira is a plutocrat .compared with the
attenuated mark, which has been worth at
times less than one penny. And that is why
the Italians, first of all the Allies, cry aloud
for an immediate revision of the Peace
Treaty. The economics ,of that document,
they say, may have been dictated by a stern
sense of justice, but if justice was stern
she was also blind. If Mr. Hughes were
to expound his economic theories in Italy
to-day he would stand a fair chance of being
stoned as a dangerous anarchist. For the
logic of facts is more compelling than the
logic of revenge or moral indignation, and
the logic of facts says that it is useless to
try to milk a cow after you have cut her
throat, and thart a dead carcase will poison
a whole dairy. Italy is convinced from its
own great necessities that the Peace Treaty,
if carried into effect, will perform the
throat-cutting operation on Germany with
efficiency. Yet, whether the cow’s throat
be cut or not, it is now beginning to appear
that the business of getting the milk will
present some difficulties.
In a recent speech Nitti, the Italian
Premier, voiced the new gospel. Pie dared
to utter the word Reconciliation. Pie said
that there was more to be gained, morally
and _ materially, for Italy and Europe, in
helping Germany to heal her wounds, than
by thrusting fresh pike-heads into her. En-
couraged by what was apparently a universal
shout of approval, he declared that the re-
construction of the late enemy countries
was the sacred trust of Italy, which would
be the vanguard of civilisation. This speech
was rapturously applauded by the Italian
Parliament, and a vote of confidence in the
Government was carried by a triumphant
majority. So sobering to the imagination
is a threepenny lira which used to be worth
tenpence that Jingoes and Catholics, Irre-
dentists and Socialists alike hailed this
doctrine with the affectionate enthusiasm of
lifelong conviction. And gradually those
who, professing to lead, merely seek to re-
flect the opinion of the multitude, have been
pushed on to declare that it is the holy
mission of Italy, which has machinery hut
lacks food, to hold out the olive branch to
Soviet Russia, which has a surplus of food
but lacks machinery. So potent an argu-
ment is a food-ration which is rapidly
dwindling to vanishing point, that the party
which a few months ago said there could
be no making peace with the blood-stained
regicides of Moscow, applauded this utter-
ance as if it were its own.
Before the war German industry and
German organisation were considered indis-
pensable to Italy. And Italy does not
seem to have found anything to replace
them. Whether it be true or not that during
the war German airmen distributed disease
germs amongst the civilian population of
their enemies, _ it is certainly true that the
diseased condition of the Germanic peoples
is spreading a moral and physical contagion
throughout Europe. And no sanitary cordon
can prevent its spread, for it works'through
the world-pervading ethic of economics. To-
day the exchange has advanced against
Italy gnother 10 points, and a rationing
scale has been introduced in Rome which
can scarcely keep body and soul together.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Back to Responsible Government!
When Mustapha Kemal decided to fight
the Allies rather than accept the Turkish
Peace Terms, his move reacted as far away
as Melbourne is. Idiotic though it may be,
this country, in which practi.ally every fit
expeditionary soldier has now been demobi-
lised, is still technically in a state of war:
and if something drastic is not done to the
Hughes Government the nation looks like
remaining in a state of war for months, if
not years, to come. Real freedom is rigor-
ously enough delimited under the modern
party system, without exploiting a fiction to
make the position worse. In theory the
sovereign people possess considerable power
under peace conditions. In practice
they have the opportunity about once in
three years of voting for the least objection-
able of a handful of party nominees. Thou-
sands of Conservatives had to swallow the
first Fisher Government’s social policy, of
which they disapproved, or oppose National
Defence, which they felt to be desperately
urgent. When the war began thousands of
Laborites had to swallow Hughes or sup-
port a party which, as a whole, was hostile
to the men in the trenches. Many of the
Parliamentary happenings of the past few
months are typical of what goes on in every
elective assembly in normal times. Not a
single member of the Federal Parliament
was authorised to raise his salary to £IOOO
a year. In fact, it was admitted by as good
a judge of electioneering as the Prime Minis-
ter that the increase would be turned down
by the taxpayers if they were given a chance
to vote on it. On the other hand, a citizen
army has been demanded over and over again.
The protests of the electors over the £IOOO-a-
--vear steal are still being registered, and the
Government’s only comment has been.an inti-
mation, made last week by the Assistant
Minister for Defence, that, owing to a
shortage of cash, citizen training may have
to be abandoned. It is as certain as any-
thing can be that the general public favors
the Army Reserve scheme (under which ex-.
A.I.F. men would have been available as an
effective first line of defence for at least five
years) and the payment of cash gratuities to
necessitous cases. Yet apparently the Re-
serve is doomed, while the needy and the
lately-married are not getting cash, though
plenty of bonds are forthcoming for the
affluent and the single. The public at large
has no means of registering its disapproval of
any such performances this side of 1922, and
the more impudently Pai’liament flouts the
electors’ will the less likely members natu-
rally are to risk a dissolution. At the best,
under peace conditions, the nation is in the
hands of a little band of oligarchs made up
of the most forceful men in the Cabinet.
Under war conditions, and with one of the
Hughes temperament in charge, it is under
an autocrat who wields greater powers than
the ex-Kaiser did, or than any king or presi-
dent does. In the exercise of those powers
—which include the right to suppress free
speech, muzzle the press, and deport anyone
who objects—the despot is limited only by
the views of his followers as to what is ex-
pedient; and the Hughesite who can’t appre-
ciate the expediency of all Hughes does is
on the path recently trodden by William
Watt. There is a slender chance that Aus-
tralia may get back, in fact and in theory, as
much freedom as it enjoyed before the War
Precautions Act came into operation. That
will happen when Pai’liament asserts itself,
irrespective of party, and insists on
the repeal of a measure which hasn’t the
remotest connection with the differences be-
tween Turkey and Greece. But the people
will not again know real freedom —meaning
the ability to bar the Executive from raiding
their pockets at will, or otherwise flouting
their known wishes —until the Constitution
is altered to provide for the Initiative,
Referendum and Recall.

H.C.L. —Bless It!
The high cost of living should be the best
thing that ever happened to Australia. We
ought to be making ourselves first indepen-
dent and then rich in consequence of it.
The U'.S.A. got itself into a position of tre-
mendous financial power in the early years
of the war; and it was nearly all because
of H.C.L. Belligerent and other countries
wanted many things desperately, and the
U.S.A. proceeded to supply them at prices
of desperation. The world wants many
things just as desperately now, and is pre-
pared to pay prices to correspond. That
furnishes Australia with an opportunity such
as it never had before, and is never at all
likely to get again. This is the moment
when a country with heavy debts ought to
work harder than it ever worked before, when
it ought to export more, when it ought to
import less. That is to say. when it ought
to sell all it can and buy as little as it must.
It can pay off more debt with a ton of
copper or wheat or wool than it ever could
before or is likely to do again ; and it can
get less for anything it borrows abroad just
as for anything it buys. H.C.L.—it is the
chance of a century! It is only our own
stupidity, short-sightedness and selfishness
which makes it a curse instead of a blessing.
—
A Kicking Industrial Gun.
Fob the first time in the history of Tas-
mania the docile order of persons called
clerks has been presented with a wages-
board award, and the howls of indignation
that have followed it are calculated to dis-
turb the police. Unhappily, the protests
are not all emitted by the employers. The
Wages Board, composed of representatives
lacking previous experience of their job,
adopted the plan of fixing salaries according
to age and length of service, and entirely
omitted any provision for grading according
to efficiency. Thus a clerk who happens to
be over 23 and has seen six years’ service
is to get not less than £5 a week, regardless
of his capacity, while a possibly vastly
superior because better-equipped youth or
maiden of 20 or so cannot demand much
over £3 a week. The result is that scores
of the older and mostly married clerks have
been sacked and their places filled with the
cheaper juniors. Something like 50 old
hands are under notice to depart in a batch
from one well-known Hobart establishment,
and something similar is happening to the
senior office employees of the chief mercan-
tile houses at both ends of the island.
Naturally most of the displaced men, and
many of their employers, regard the award
as easily the most unsatisfactory dispensa-
tion on record, and deputations are asking
the Government to suspend the offensive
thing or obliterate the Board. Though
Premier Lee admits that the “wage for age”
fixture is about as absurd as a wage for
weight or height would bd, he is not dis-
posed to over-ride the Board’s deliberate
decision. Instead, he promises to try for
an amendment of the Wages Board Act to
permit a Board to attempt some rational
system of grading of clerks and fix the pro-
portion of seniors and juniors if it so desires.
That sort of industrial legislation which pro-
fesses adherence to the principle of the
“round-table conference” and then deliber-
ately runs away from that principle by limit-
ing the powers of the tribunal to about half
those necessary for the adequate performance
of its alleged functions, is the sort that
breeds Bolsheviks and provides direct action-
ists with a sure foundation for their soap-
boxes. Some faint glimmer of this obvious
truth seems to be penetrating even the thick-
est legislative skulls ; whether their economic
murk will be dispelled before they are over-
whelmed with an even greater disaster is
another question. This paper is not unmind-
ful of the fact that the wage-earning crowd
is at present so ideal-less and so sectionally
split that on paper it looks anything but
formidable; also it is hard to believe that
Australian intelligence, probably the highest
on earth, will ever permit itself to be
seduced into always painful and generally
disastrous short-cuts to the Millennium. All
the same, it would be folly to disregard his-
tory ; the world has on many occasions seen
an apparently disorganised rabble suddenly
cohere like a swarm of bees; and even in-
telligent folks, when patience snaps, may
turn into berserk furies. Wherefore legis-
lators and others are reminded once again
that if gross travesties of justice are com-
mitted in the name of arbitration and the
peaceful settlement of industrial disputes,
arbitration and peaceful settlement will be
spurned, and direct action will set its finest
advertisement. Arbitration and the like are
in the lists against direct action, which is
disorder and revolution ; and in that struggle
Bolshevism gets its best help from those who
starve arbitration courts and manacle wages
boards.
The Contempt That Isn’t.
In Melbourne on April 15, the case being
that of the Federated Timber Workers’
Union and the venue the Court of Justice
Higgins, a timber merchant remarked that
the employees didn’t turn out as much work
as they used to. He referred to his own
business and to men paid by the day. and
cited the instance of a machine-hand on
piecework whose daily tale of timber was
45 bundles, whereas the man at the next
machine weighed in with only 30 bundles,
he being paid by the day. Thereupon Justice
Higgins observed that every allegation
made before him in regard to slowing-down
had evaporated on investigation. “Will you,
as manager of a big company, say that there
has been any slowing-down?” he asked. The
witness replied emphatically that he would,
“and I speak,” he added, “as one who has
kept a close watch on the business all the
time. The men don’t turn out as much as
they did six or seven years ago.” There
the argument ended, as far as the Court
was concerned, but the Akgus observed
next morning:—
Although the Court can take no cognisance of
notorious facts, there is nothing in the law to forbid
the public from feeling amused at this display of
innocence from the Bench. A contractor who knows
a great deal about bricklaying furnished in Sydney
recently precise figures as to the number of bricks
laid each day now compared with an earlier period.
His evidence showed that the work had fallen by
nearly 50 per cent. An employer in the Arbitration
Court yesterday had emphatic opinions on the sub-
ject also. The detachment of the Arbitration Court
from the facts of industrial life explains, in some
measure, why industrial life is rapidly detaching
itself from the Court.
For this expression of opinion on a matter
of public interest that wasn’t an issue in
the case (the employers’ representative said
he wouldn’t press it), the Akgus was pro-
secuted in the City Court and fined £25
with £2l costs. It was actually proceeded .
against on four informations, one of them
being that its comments were calculated to
improperly influence a witness before the
Court, and another that they were calculated
to improperly influence tjie Court itself.
The Court is Justice Higgins, and even a
Melbourne P.M. saw something humorous
in the idea that any remarks of the Akgus
could improperly influence Higgins against
Higgins. He found it equally impossible
to believe that the article would improperly
influence a supposititious witness. But the
magistrate (Notley Moore) held that the
paper was guilty of contempt of Court, and
had published words calculated to bring the
Court into disrepute. The effect of the
whole article, he ruled, was to make the
reader think lightly of the Court and doubt
whether it was worth going to, and the
words “this display of innocence from the
Bench” exhibited an intention to bring the
Court into disrepute and to show contempt
for it. This is an original interpretation
of contempt of Court. Contempt of Court
is usually regarded as comment on the
issues before a Court, such comment as
might injure one side or another by preju-
dicing the cause. But according to Notley
Moore, P.M., it may be contempt to com-
ment on issues that are not before the Court.
Some measures certainly ought to be taken
to show Mr. Moore that he is ridiculously
wrong. One may indeed show the pro-
foundest respect for the law and the strong-
est interest in its proper administration by
showing the profoundest disrespect for some
unworthy occupant of the Bench. One
night even doubt whether Mr. Moore should
be on the Bench and still be a decent citi-
zen. If a newspaper, thinking ill of Mr.
Moore, proceeded to give reasons why he
should not be on the Bench, his proper
course would be to sue for libel, if he judged
the statements to be untrue. To proceed
for contempt of Court —to charge that no-
thing must be said about a Judge or a mag-
istrate because it may bring his Court into
disrepute—would be an attack upon the
liberty of the press far too heavily fraught
with danger to the public to be submitted to.
• ♦-
The Spread of Disease.
Members of the N. S. Wales Labor Con-
ference considered the question of amending
the still-dormant State V.D. Act to pro-
vide for the registration of prostitutes, and
decided against a system which has justified
itself in other parts of the world, apparently
without knowing very much about it. -If
the control of vice is wrong in itself, then
plainly it is wrong in all its degrees, and
true virtue is only to be found in unchecked
promiscuity. Let any Labor man or woman
who holds such principles ask the first avail-
able ex-A.I.F. man what his views are of
the West End of London by night—one of
the many parts of England where non-regis-
tration, carried to its logical conclusion,
may be seen in full blast. Or let the
inquirer merely study the comparative
figures _of V.D. infection amongst men on
leave in London and Paris, respectively,
during any one year of the late war. Half
a century ago the clear-headed French per-
ceived the folly, if not the wickedness, of
allowing their old men to sit back smugly
while the hot-blooded young, and in many
thousands of cases their innocent children,
were ravaged by avertible disease. The
French therefore swallowed registration, un-
pleasant as it may be, while the Gladstones
of England were winning the approval of
Church elders by fighting it; and the
national health of France has wonderfullv
benefited by the dose. In Cairo also the inci-
dence of V.D. was greatly diminished amongst
the troops from the moment supervision of
prostitutes was instituted. If it was allow-
able to recognise the existence of sin amongst
our fighting-men abroad, why is it not allow-
able amongst civilians at 4bme? Should we
not, in fact, recognise it more readily at home
since naturally we care more for our own
womenfolk and children than for those of
foreigners? There are, admittedly, objec-
tions to registration. On the practical side
the most obvious is that semi-prostitutes
might be blackmailed with threats of the
police, or be driven into registered houses,
and so irretrievably ruined. A great deal
of blackmail is encouraged, however, by
non-registration. Most public women, for
example, and the tenants of perhaps 90 per
cent, of the houses which they frequent, are
required to pay illegal toll to someone in
authority. But the most telling argument
in all British communities is a sentimental
one, having reference to the degrading effects
or registration on the women themselves.
Few are so dull as not to understand, even
sympathise with, the nausea that the idea
of registration creates in certain good people.
But the same delicate-minded souls would
probably be nauseated by sewers if they got
close enough to them. Yet we shall go on
having sewers. It is not the registration
that is degrading. It is the business itself;
and if the women are made by the necessity
for registration to realise its true nature,
so much the better —the social purists and
the honest feminists, at any rate, ought not
to complain. At the worst the prophylactic
is a deal more bearable than the trouble
aimed at. In support of registration it
only needs to be said that if notification of
V.D. is accepted (and most sensible
people do accept it as necessary nowa-
days), then supervision, and the more rigid
the better, must follow—unless the State
is prepared to build lock hospitals broad-
cast. The proof of this lies in the fact
noted recently by the Medical Journal of.
Australia that under non-supervision “over
25 per cent, of our prostitutes are suffer-
ing from, and therefore spreading, venereal
disease.”
The State as a Wool Dealer.
Dear Bulletin —The pot has boiled over
at last, or the boiler has burst with the
suppressed heat. When Prime Minister
Hughes blurted out that our farmers have
not received more than a third of the value
of their wool it meant many things. Two of
these are enough to look at just now. (1)
Inasmuch as Plenipotentiary Watt had
made the supererogatory sale of last sea-
son’s clip (that closing on 30th June), it
was rough on him to have the fact'' pro-
claimed that he (Watt) had blown, in
one act, £80,000,000 out of Australia, just
when his chief mission to London was' “to
place a loan in the cheapest market.” It is
Proverbial Didactics.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If Austral workers have a mind to Bolsh,
With closed eyes they’ll lend their ears to
Walsh ;
But if they deem rebellion crude and costly
They’ll seek to change their loud-voiced
leaders, mostly,
For such as aim at all mankind’s improve-
ment
By ever urging on the Labor movement
To sane endeavor—thoughtful men who know
That not by wasteful strikes, nor going slow,
Nor shorter hours (and longer time for
beering),
Can Labor hope to put down profiteering.
Reformers preach the creed of altruism,
Whilst Walshes pin their faith to Bol-
shevism.
Do workers hope, through all the coming
ages,
To do less work, and less, for rising wages?
That Governments, by printing paper-money,
Can flood the land with oil and wine and
honey ?
The game must stop; no trickster cute and
clever
Can fool the whole wide world at large for-
ever ;
No Lenin gull for aye the Russian hordes
(Who ask for deeds) with wealth of empty
words.
Not always shall the masses’ waking brain
Be lulled to sleep and drehm delusions vain,
Conceiving, on the droll Gilbertian plan,
A “Gondoliers” equality of man.
What wrongs can unionism hope to right *
By putting out the gas-consumers’ light?
What final gain to Labor can there be
In simply “paralysing industry?”
Fools go on strike to gratify the hate
Of angry rebels, warring ’gainst the State,
Who, egged-on slily by would-be marauders,
Would close the reign of law till further
orders,
For dear old Erin’s sake! Where’er we
glance
We see the young Australian worker dance
To Irish music, and with welcome hearty
Add Emmet’s spectre to the Labor Party.
Am I, now toiling with my little pen,
Not one among the crowd of working men?-
How long must I, who deprecate “the fight,”
Like tens of thousands more be starved of
_ light
Whilst Bolslj cries No Surrender? Must I
lack
A winter fire when wood and coal are
black,”
And all the tried and true united carters
Regard all men who chuck their jobs as
martyrs?
Forgive me, Bolsh: one needs must bear
one’s crosses
That you may try your might against the
bosses,
And make demands, on any weak pretence,
For some absurd Round Table Conference.
Lo! prices; soon shall rise for unskilled
labors
Till lumpers laugh at lean, black-coated
neighbors.
And men employed in certain work are blest
With ample means to strike—and damn the
rest!
will I sing, in Pope’s prophetic strain,
Of Culture crushed and Chaos come again.
No smoke shall stain the air o’er sea or
land.
Since ne’er a stoker’s autocratic hand
w ill feed a furnace; through the evening
mists
Shall steal the wail of starving unionists.
Their bosses busted; whilst factories and
mills
Bear silent witness to the workers’ ills.
And great god Bolsit. a halo round his head,
bpits on the place where Capital lies—dead.

an inconsistency that every explanation
would make worse, and the more the corpse
is turned over the louder the smell will be-
come. (2) As the Wool Committee has
handled, say, £200,000,000 of wool-growers’
money, the value according to Hughes be-
ing three times as much, the loss to Aus-
tralia is not less than £400,000,000 sterling,
a nation’s ransom. And we are officially told
that the Deity alone knows when the
farmers are to receive something, anything,
of the elusive “half-profits” on the re-sale of
their wool. For the small man, whose wool
was on skins or mixed up in bales with that
of other people,, an appeal even to the Deity
will be hopeless. The ugly story is coming
out piecemeal, as narrated a year ago by
some of us who knew the facts. And upon
the subject that involves the financial pros-
perity of this country the Press is as reti-
cent as a Trappist monastery. But look at
the salient and official figures which hardly
a wool-grower in ten thousand knows, be-
cause they are not laid before the public. At
one time there were 80,000,000 sheep in
Argentina. In 1907, according to the
official handbook of that country, it grazed
68,000,000 sheep. Its “Monthly Bulletin
of Statistics,” No. 5, issued by the Supreme
Economic Council in November last, states
that the number of sheep in Argentiha on
June 1, 1914, was 43,225,000, and that the
estimate for 1918 was 44,850,000. An emi-
nent Australian statistician remarked to
me: “If those figures are correct for Argen-
tina it amounts to a world catastrophe.”
And referring to his books he found them
sustained. The numbers of South Africa
and of Maoriland remain about stationary
at 28,000,000 each, but much of the S.
African wool is of poor quality. Australia,
Argentina, Africa are the chief exporting
countries, in the order named. America has
increased in population by 20,000,000 souls
while sheep have diminished in the- U.S. by
10,000,000. Australia has 35,000,000 sheep
fewer than in 1891. Yht the genial Lord
Derby only agreed under pressure, as the
week’s cables tell us, that Australia should
have 55 per cent, advance on pre-war prices
for her wool, barely equal to the deprecia-
tion in currency! The while that American
cotton was 300 per cent., and Egyptian cot-
ton 520 per cent, dearer 1 Prime Minister
Hughes fights like Billy Magee and he
made a good struggle in London for Aus-
tralia, but this “land of boundless resources”
has not had a fair deal for its primary pro-
ducts. The Freetrade gag is that “the
farmer gets the world’s parity.” He doesn’t.
It would be all right if he did. —Yours,
Octavius C. Beale.

The Ma State’s Latest Loan.
Eight months ago N. S. Wales raised
£3,000,000 in London at a cost of about 5|
p.c. per annum, but since then Holman,
who was bad, has been succeeded by
Storey, who is worse, and Storey’s
entourage, which is impossible; so the
supply of money has been reduced
by the scared lender aud the price raised.
Another £3,000.000 is wanted from J.
Bull, but the utmost he will do is £2,500,000
at 6J p.c. It is due for repayment 20 years
hence, so by that time the State will have paid
£3,250,000 interest and at least a quarter
million more in expenses, making £3,500,000
for the very temporary use of £2,500,(XX).
Then the loan will have to be renewed on
terms unknown. The single trace of humor
in the situation is that N. S. Wales is
now running two loans abreast —this of
£2,500,000 in London and the other of
£2,000,000 in Sydney. They used to go in
single file like spooks or Chinamen, but the
pace has become faster. Nobody knows
exactly how much the N. S. Wales debt is
now, for the printing of statistics isn’t fast
enough to keep pace with the accumulation,
but it reached the £100,000,000 mark under
Labor rule in 1912; struck the £150,000,000
mark under Labor in 1918; and under an
extra-robust variety of Labor it is now head-
ing towards £200,000,000. That is purely
State peace debt, of course. It is quite cer-
tain that the Storey-Dooley Ministry has
no great business enterprises in view which
will return 61 or 7 p.c. on huge masses of
cadged money, nor even 3 p.c. and possibly
not 1 p.c. Its brightest ideas are repairing
roads, building schools and paying baby
pensions—all decent and motherly enough,
though wholly unremunerative. But who
cares? The party politician’s business
is to win support; and the scattering of loan
money is an easy way of doing it until the
public awakens to the meaning of it all.

Sydney’s Housing Shortage.
Dr. Arthur, M.L.A., writes: —
The refusal of the building artisans to work on
Saturday has as yet had little or no effect on the
housing problem in Sydney. The causes of the
shortage are: (1) Increase of cost of building
material; (2) shortage of labor during the war,
owing to many men enlisting; (3) diversion of capi-
tal to war loans; (4) Fair Rents Act, making inves-
tors turn a sour eye on house property; (5) undue
increases of population due to (a) dependants of
men who enlisted coming to live in Sydney and
remaining there, (b) former residents in the coun-
try returning with English wives and taking a job
in Sydney; (c) the drought driving the country
unemployed citywards; (and) the 1917 strike bringing
hundreds of men to Sydney to work on the wharves,
carting, etc., and many of them settling down there
and sending for their families. I make no comment
on these facts, but simply say that N. S. Wales should
possess the power existing in England for 30 years to
compel authorities like the Railway Commissioners,
companies like the firm in question at Ultimo, and
individuals who have resumed workmen’s houses to
demolish and use the land for other purposes, to pro-
vide housing for the dispossessed families. Again, I
have always been an advocate for decentralisation,
and seven years ago conducted a party of farmers and
settlers to Port Stephens to show them the marvellous
possibilities for a great shipping port there. A city
could be built there with all modern facilities for
handling cargo, warehouses on the wharves, with
railway lines running into them, ipstead of the
antediluvian methods' reigning in Sydney. Thus the
firm intending to build a wool store at Ultimo has
chosen a site well away both from a wharf front and
from railway communication, so that all goods will
have to go to and from the store in carts !
Upon which the only remark that The
Bulletin has to make is that, if 400 men
can build a cottage in a day, 25 cottages
that might be built and ought to be built
are unbuilt every day that 10,000 men in
the building trades are idle. And at the
end of 10 weeks, if only half-days are lost,
there are 125 cottages less than there might
have been. The building-trade artisans are
only responsible for so much of the house-
famine as they could and can avert. But
A NOTHER PROCESSION.
( Organised by forty-hour weekers and other go-slowers.)
they are wholly and utterly responsible for
that much —except that politicians who en-
courage them in their work-shirking must
share the responsibility with them.
The Pre-Election Fraud.
Ti-ie kick of an old and tried Laborite: —
Martin Hannah, a well-known Laborite, who has
for a number of Parliaments represented Colling-
wood in the Vic. Assembly, has just been outed
at a pre-election. Now, though I have never
cheered Martin, he has always voted with the party
■on matters of policy, and has not twisted on the
platform. Back in the old days, when Labor pos-
sessed but a few M’s.P., when £1000 per annum
for politicians was unthought of, when it needed
sincerity and gameness to go out organising indus-
trially and to punch along the cause of Labor,
Hannah joined up with the movement. He has
never committed a fault against the party, he has
kept Colling wood one of the safest seats for Labor
in Australia, and for no solid reason except that
others want his job he is kicked out, and another
man, who has never even twinkled in the Labor
sky, gets it. And, with the £1000 a year attrac-
tion in the Federal Parliament, you’ll hear and see
a lot more of similar pre-election tragedies.
Victorian elections are conducted on a preferen-
tial system of voting that cuts out all reasons for
pre-election ballots. The latter system takes the
job of selecting the personnel out of the hands of
the people, and gives it to a clique, which can-
vasses, schemes and rigs like a crowd of ’eads at
a bush pony meeting. And Hannah’s case is not
solitary. Owen Sinclair, of Port Melbourne, a
solid Laborite, got his pre-election green-ticket a
couple of Parliaments back; and the only reason
offered was that he didn’t support the idea of
leaving the hotels open till all hours. He was
simply a victim of underground engineering. Another
Labor man in an industrial suburb had twice taken
on a forlorn political contest at consecutive elec-
tions against a popular Liberal —a gqod-as-Labor
man. He was beaten, as he expected to be. The
good-as-Labor man passed out. The ■ seat or the
Labor pre-election in all fairness should have gone
to the fighting Laborite, who had dug all the
trenches. But in the pre-election he didn’t have
a hope. Better wire-pullers (which means less
scrupulous ones) saw to that.
Hannah hasn’t had a fair go. He is a good
Australian. He has done more for Australian timber
in Victoria than any timber merchant or saw-
miller. He made Victorians know that our native
hardwood is a timber of beauty and utility. He
has done all this outside the platform, but not
against it. If the Labor people carpet him for this,
so much the Worse for the Labor people. He has
been always a good Protectionist. He is a better
Australian. And he is out through a system which
is not only essentially undemocratic, but plays
into the hands of the tricksters. In another 10
years, unless the Labor authorities eliminate these
pre-elections, the party’s personnel is going to be
something to be merely ashamed of.
♦
The Melbourne strike trouble is being
patched in the old unsatisfactory way;
wherefore the next disagreement will resolve
itself into the same old trial by combat or
work-stoppage. The more industries there
are to be stopped and the more the com-
munity has learned to depend on them, the
bigger and more destructive the trial by
combat becomes, but it grows no more logi-
cal. It doesn’t follow that the demands
made by the Melbourne workers were in the
least degree exorbitant; but a man who
would gladly pay sixpence if an established
authority said sixpence was a fair thing
hates to have a penny taken from him be-
cause someone wants it and thinks he is
big enough to take it. This hatred is human
nature; also it is based on the fear that the
threatening person may go on demanding
until the demands are plain imposture. And
every time a body of men is able to extract
unreasonable terms by bailing up, or threat-
ening to bail up, the public, the foundations
are laid for more trouble. In the present
case, for instance, engine-drivers, charged
with very large responsibilities; urge that
they are getting far less than carters, the
latter having had no compunction about
using their power to squeeze out the last
_drop the public would yield. So what is
obtained by force is used as an argument
when another matter comes before a Court
where force is not supposed to rule.
Duking the war the long-headed members
of the anti-conscription crowd got a lot of
comfort from the conviction that the soldiers
on their return would easily be disrupted—
chiefly by politics or religion. If the thing
isn’t already happening it is not for lack
of encouragement in certain quarters. The
row over Father Jerger was eagerly made
into a religious question by the militant
sects; though, in fact, the only live issue
here lies between the War Precautions Act
and the principle of personal liberty. And
now the secretary of the Fitzroy (Vic.) sub-
branch of the R.S.A. has written to his
president to ask why he (the president)
isn’t out on strike with the other gasworlters.
Similarly the unionists of an R.S.A. branch
might object to the employers in it, or. vice
versa; or in an Irish centre the Hibernians
might demand the exclusion of the Metho-
dists. Only one class would benefit from
such developments, viz., the eligible non-
starters, who are naturally opposed to the
preference arrangement. If the soldiers
want to save their Leagues as instruments
of usefulness to themselves as soldiers, they
will vigilantly keep them non-political and
unsectarian. It won’t be easy, since in
every League there will be found members
who think a lot more of unionism or Social-
ism or Calathumpianism than they do of the
welfare of the returned men as a body. But
the Digger did a thousand things that
weren’t easy.
The cow cocky is having a bad time on the
South Coast (N.S.W.) this winter. So
scarce is milk that one Sydney distributing
co. has been compelled to put on motor
lorries to collect supplies from as far south
as Milton, 40 miles beyond the South Coast
railway terminus, "while another city co. has
collared the erstwhile suppliers of the
Bacchus Marsh Concentrated Milk Cos.,
which has ceased operations temporarily.
Butter and cheese factories are almost at
a standstill, the country looks withered and
weary, and the average cocky wears his Day
of Judgment face. Of course the long dry
spell is blamed, but much of the misery is
due to the sheer laziness of the cockies
themselves. Last summer was one of the
most prolific seasons experienced on the
Coast for years. Pink and white clover
grew up to. Strawberry’s belly, and crops
flourished everywhere. The South Coast
was a land flowing with milk and honey
(good care was taken to keep the wholesale
price at the solid figure of Is. per gallon),
and the suppliers stroked their whiskers
gleefully and thought they would never see
a poor day. Of the feed that was going to
waste very few farmers put away any in a
silo to help them over a dry spell. It was
always “Oh, whasser good'?” Those beyond
the Shbalhaven, not having Sussex-street to
lean up against, have learnt wisdom by ex-
perience, and a farm without a silo is rare.
But north of the Shoalhaven, in the area
from which Sydney obtains the bulk of its
milk supply, the farmers, by reason of their
bovine improvidence, are now compelled to
stall-feed on bran and chaff, the present price
of the former being fll 10s. per ton, as
compared with £3 or £4 a ton a few years
ago. The result is that, along with some-
thing amounting to the starvation of infants
in the .city, there have been unprecedented
increases in the price of milk, and there is
still a demand for more in order to buy
feed at exorbitant prices to keep the herds
on their legs. And city price-fixing boards
and the like allow the increases without
raking these people fore and aft, or even
warning them that, if they make the public
pay for their improvidence in a lean season,
there are not going to be ayy high prices
for them in a fat season, such as last sum-
mer. A regular and abundant milk supply
is a matter of such national importance that
the present thriftlessness of those in the in-
dustry must be rooted out somehow.

“B.” on a confused matter of taxation: —
The money for Gregory McGirk’s kid-pension (or
vote-purchase) scheme is, it seems, to come from the
childless couples of Potts Point. It would take a
thumping big tax on the childless couples of Potts
Point to pension the kids in one Pyrmont street.
The amount of the benefaction is to be 7s. Gd. a
week, the,same as the knut who didn’t marry the
girl pays, and presumably Potts Point will be
entitled to it as well as Pyrmont if Potts Point
can deliver the goods. Driven by necessity, to say
nothing of the hope of gaining 7s. 6d. a week, Potts
Point may conceivably wipe out the foul reproach
on its fecundity, in which case it will disappear as
a taxable entity, and the Minister for Motherhood
will have to tax anew source of wealth to pro-
vide the 7s. 6d. a week. In Britain there is a
Labor proposal to levy the income tax on families,
the single man paying full tax and the married
man with seven or more children nothing, there
being proportionate reductions in between for each
child. This would work out all right for the
State in the cases of heirless millionaires like
Lipton and McCaughey and of wealthy peers with
one child like Inchcapf. and the Duke of Bedford,
but an army of rich cutlers and cotton-spinners and
shipowners and woollen manufacturers would escape
taxation. , And, apart from the consequences to the
revenue, a plutocrat with 14 children can be as
great a danger or a nuisance to the community as
a plutocrat with none. These fancy schemes for
the endowment of motherhood and the encouragement
of, population are beautiful in theory. The trouble
is that they won’t work.
In the last 15 years there have been
only three hangings in South Aus-
tralia ; and in all three cases there was
something to exasperate the jury. In the
case of llabibullah, the Afghan, who killed
his wife, it was the cutting up of the body
and throwing it in the Torrens. In Ring’s
case it was the wanton shooting of a police-
man who had just previously tried to do
him a kindness. In the third case, that of
Budd, it was the callousness of the crime
and the entire absence of provocation. Budd
wanted to own a motor-car. He hired a
car*, got the owner (a complete stranger)
to drive him on a lonely country road at
night, and there killed him and took pos-
session of his car. Lee, the man who was
promptly found guilty after a nine days’
trial, stands an excellent chance of making
a fourth. Charged with poisoning his wife
and three children—he had promised mar-
riage to another woman when this one was
dead—he tried to escape from the conse-
quence of his cold-blooded treachery by
branding his wife as a murderess and a
suicide. It is the sort of case which cries
aloud for an amendment of the law to provide
for degrees of murder: that the next man
only technically guilty of the crime, or who
has committed it under great provocation,
should have to be put on the same mark, so
to speak, by a 'jury, is as unfair to the
jury as to the prisoner. In effect, it means
that many a prisoner who ought to be found
guilty of something is acquitted of every-
thin g. Nor is that conclusion affected by
the fact admitted above that, in practice, so
careful is the Executive that only the very
worst cases come to the gallows.


A strong, virile nation needs strong, virile
tasks on which to bend its energies. The
Iron and Steel Industry opens up such a
field of endeavor for Australian Manhood,
providing work that develops and fosters
self-control, initiative, stamina and force
of character.
The Australian
Iron and Steel
Industry
would give employment at Australian rates of pay (if
all the Iron and Steel goods imported into Australia
were made by our own people) to not less than
30,000 MEN,
who would earn over
£5»000,000 per year.
POLITICAL
POINTS
A Fair Profits Commission has been
shocked to find that two of Vic.’s 10 small
woollen mills have made 50 and 45 p.c.
respectively: the profits of the others are
moderate enough to pass muster. Fifty
per cent, does seem pretty dreadful; yet,
judging by the price that Australia has to
pay for its imported woollens, if these mills
had exported their output they could have
made twice as much. The Commission which
proceeds to find out what profit a competi-
tive concern makes is looking at the wrong
end of the business. If the profits of an
exceptionally well-equipped and exception-
ally well-handled manufacturing business
are limited, then it must either waste money
or sell its output for so little that the
smaller, struggling and more poorly equipped
and less well-organised concern cannot com-
pete, and is squeezed to death.
PALS.
FOOTPAD (to unemployed gnsworker):
“Yes, it’s a bonder strike orright. But
I dunno who's done best out of it, YOU
OR ME.”
The pathetic faith in loan railways.
According to Sydney Telegraph :
On one of the stations in the Lower Macquarie
wild pigs have become so numerous and destructive
that persons are employed destroying them, ine
carcases are not utilised as, under existing .condi-
tions, it will not pay to send them awa.v owing to
the long distance they have to be carted.... m tne
present food shortage this seems little short 0
calamity, and is another instance of the _ necessity
for opening up the country by light lines of lailway,
which would be beneficial to the whole State.
So light lines are to be built with nioney
raised at heavy interest out to the light,
swift, fantastic pig! The world is accus-
tomed to build lines to manufacturing, min-
ing, agricultural, timber and even good pas-
toral regions; also to scenic and health
resorts. But the idea of railways to wild
animals, whether pigs, emus, springbok or
elephants, is purely Australian.
A reassuring cable from London states
that it wasn’t through any doubt about the
security that John Bull cut down the N. b.
Wales loan from 3 to 2 i millions and jolted
the interest up from sto per cent. If he
had said anything else there would have
been a grievous slump in many hundreds ot
millions of securities which he has on his
hands, so he declares that the fish (his own
fish) are quite fresh.
Hawking an inverted hat round London is
a wearisome job these days, so last week
Premier Theodore escaped and had a trip
to the Partington ironworks at Manchester,
where 3000 hands are knocking out £20,000
a week on piecework, the lowest wage in the
establishment being £4 10s. a week. Theo-
dore, it is recorded, said nothing, but per-
haps he thought a lot. Maybe it began to
dawn on him why Britain could arrange to
pay off her national debt at the rate of £6
per head per annum while Queensland, under
his riotously improvident direction, was
adding the same amount to hers. In Janu-
ary, 1920, Britain’s exports to the U.b.A.
were valued at 50,000.000 dollars as against
5, 400,000 dollars in January, 1919, and the
exchange rate rose from 3.12 to 3.9 1 . And
the explanation is Work. Just plain, ordi-
nary, intelligent Work.
After the party split in 1916, Hughes put
seven Labor Heps, in the Ministry that
lasted three months. If he did it again, the
Government would be all generals, like a
Central American army, for there are only
seven Hugheseliers in the House. And not
one of them has a safe seat.
Cold Tea and Bung are buckling on their
armor for the Local Option fray which may
come in Victoria any time after August 7,
when the new Assembly rolls will be in the
hands of returning-officers. September 23 or
thereabouts seems to be the most likely time.
So hot is the tussle to be made that the
main general election issues may be put in
the shade. If the Prohibitionists would add
fair compensation to their programme and
a reasonable amount of notice, many mod-
erate people would risk a no-license vote, but
there is not the remotest prospect of such
a compromise. On present appearances there
is no hope of securing the requisite three-
fifths majority to make Vic. dry, but it is
probable that a number of licensing divisions
will vote for reducing pubs by one-fourth, and
thus provide plenty of work for Barr. Lock
and Grahame, the Licenses Reduction Board,
in selecting the worst or least wanted.
A Mrs. Cran who is here in the interests
of an English body which is anxious to
settle Britishers —more particularly ex-sol-
diers —on the Australian land, gave unifica-
tion an advt. last week. The intending
settler, she said, is given all possible infor-
mation about the country at each of the
3ix Agents-General’s offices, but ‘ always
with the addendum that Australia would
be a magnificent place if it were not for
five States that suffer from most _ terrible
natural drawbacks.” With five-sixths of
Australia chronically blackguarding the rest
of the Commonwealth, it is not strange that
the British get odd ideas about the place.
The average Englishman has never struck
the anti-national spirit which is one of
the off-shoots of our Federal system; and
he can only conclude, when Australians say
that all but a fraction of their native land
is a desert and a home for thieves, that
they should know, and that it is a good
place to avoid altogether.
Being poor and not proud, the N. S. Wales
Government has issued a London loan of
£2,500,000 at 64 per cent., and is paying an-
other 1 per cent, to have it underwritten.
Victoria wanted £6,000,000, but refused to
pay the price. Theodore suggested £9,000,000,
and had a frosty reception. . The Australian
Treasurers financed like Micawber as long
as they could. Now they feel like the used-
up spendthrift that Pickwick met in the
sponging-house before he was committed to
prison for debt.
Queensland Agent-General Hunter con-
tinues to make a poor show of himself in
England with his talk about “a guaranteed
price for a definite period of years in order
to justify the expense of the preliminary out-
lay on cotton plantations.” Cotton, isn't a
difficult crop, and the demand is immense
and increasing. Queensland has the land
(acquired gratis from colored parties wi.th
no title deeds), the climate, and a very large
local market in Australia alone. It is an
absolutely untouched market, too—almost
the only one in the world —for Australia im-
ports everything. To ask in addition for a
guarantee from persons at the other end of
the globe suggests such shocking helpless-
ness that John Bull may even have doubts
about lending money in that direction.
The Prince of Wales spoke as kindly as
he well could about Canberra without com-
mitting himself. He remarked that it, like
Ottawa, was to be built as a capital from
the very first. Tlffi same might be said of
Washington. But both Canada and the
United States aimed at selecting the most
central spot that circumstances allowed,
though both countries grew up afterwards
and got away from the metropolis. To Aus-
tralia, which is finished by Nature and can’t
expand, belongs the unstatesmanlike idea of
putting the metropolis of the whole country
amid a huddle of State capitals in a small
peninsula in the extreme south-east, where
the rulers can’t keep an eye on the only
probable invaders, though they may be handy
in case of an attack by whales from the
Pole.
W. H. Edgar, M.L.C., ran a service of
intercession at the Presbyterian Assembly
Hall, Melbourne, the other day. The con-
gregation engaged in prayer that industrial
turmoilers would be guided by a sense of
right. Yes, that’s all very well; but whose
sense of right?
“There is no kind of authority that the
Parliament and the people of the United
Kingdom claim any longer to exercise over
the Parliaments and peoples of the
Dominions.” Milner, Secretary for the
Colonies, said that in the Lords a few days
ago, and it ought to be pretty nearly the
end of the argument as to the right of Aus-
tralia to nominate its own State Governors.
Edward S. Sorenson’s idea of it: —
If I had to deal with the Northern Territory pro-
blem, which seems to be getting worse instead of
better, I’d begin at the southern end, by running
a railway from S. Aus. to the Macdonnell Ranges
and forming a settlement there. The latter would be
simple enough once that beat iful central area was
made generally known and easy to reach. For farm-
ing, dairying, fruit-
growing and grazing
there is no finer coun-
try in Australia than
around those ranges,
which have a length of
about 400 miles, a
varying width of 20
to 50 miles, and a
maximum elevation of
5000 ft. Dee p-water
creeks, waterfalls and
springs are numerous,
and the scenery mag-
nificent. As for cli-
mate, those ranges
will some day be one
of the great sanatori-
ums of the world.
Most people have got
it into their heads
that Central Australia
is mostly desert; There
are certainly great belts
of dry sandy and stony country around this vast oasis
that are hell to travel over; but these terrors would
vanish with a railway* Half the disabilities of the
interior would, go with the bridging of the thirsty
stretch; and once a going settlement was established
at the Ranges the northern wastes towards Darwin
would begin to dwindle.
The Opposition factions are at loggerheads
in Bananaland over the coming elections.
The N.D.C. has offered the P.P.U. a slice
of the Nationalist loaf, but the Cockies want
the whole of it —in the country electorates,
anyway. Three Nationalist members
Swayne of Mirani, Corser of Biggenden,
and James of the Logan—have gone over
to Hayseed, and as other charges are im-
pending the Nationalist executive is look-
ing blue. W. F. R. Boyce, father of the
State golf champion, has been doing all. the
spade work for the P.P.U.
When a real grievance-monger gets to
work the results are wonderful. A strike
at LithgoV (N.S.W.) ironworks was at
first for the reinstatement of three moulders
who were put off because there was no
moulding for them to do, and they refused
to do allegedly inferior work at the same
pav to fill in time. But when the expert got
on" the job found 32 crying wrongs, evils
and oppressions under which the men were
suffering, but which they hadn’t heard of
before. Apparently the real job of the “or-
ganiser” these times is to discover reasons
why men should stop wmrk.
The new men who have grabbed 'the
handle that turns the political Labor
machine begin to issue strenuous warnings
against a new move in the direction of Im-
perial Federation. In an- empire which is
mostly nigger, and very heterogeneous
nigger at that (though homogeneous nigger
would be worse), any real Imperial Federa-
tion is impossible. Therefore no one is
talking about it. But, in Queensland especi-
ally, there is talk of a sort of Coolie Fede-
ration without safeguards or conditions, a
levelling of the “artificial barriers,” an em-
bracing and admitting and welcoming of
anybody regardless of color or language 'or
education who is willing to be a brother;
in fact, a merging of Australian Labor into
the “International.”
The Queensland Government having
undertaken to exchange Commonwealth bank-
notes for the gratuity bonds issued to its
Digger-employees, a procession of the latter,
with bulging pockets, has been streaming
into the State Treasury—and out again. It
is now explained—it wasn’t before —that
the ghost won’t walk unless Queensland can
waft the bonds along to Melbourne in reduc-
tion of its debt to the Commonwealth Govern-
ment. And yet there are people who wonder
at Bull’s lack of perfect confidence in the
Queensland Government.
“Sym Path 6” : It must be gall and worm-
wood to stately John Grice to stoop to bar-
gain with union officials in connection with
the Melbourne gas-workers’ strike. The
knighted John is one of the old school, unim-
peachable but quite out of touch with new
social movements. Is such a one, no matter
how unimpeachable, a suitable man to be
chairman of directors of a public utility
like the Gas Co.? The subject has never, so
far as I know, been discussed ; but it seems
to me that the Government ought at least
to have the power to veto any proposed
appointment to the Board of any public
utility.
Premier Storey thanks the Churches of
N. S. Wales for praying for rain, and urges
“NOW, I WONDER WHAT’S DOING
THAT!”
them to keep on
praying, the coun-
try being still in
need of moisture.
The country is in
need of honest
finance also, but
perhaps John
doesn’t want to put
too great a strain
on Providence all
at once.
The Liberal group in the Vic. Assembly,
now numbering 37 exclusive of the Speaker,
will drop to 30 or 31 if the least of the
Labor and Farmer hopes are realised. The
optimists bank on a heavier Government de-
feat, the cockiest Cockies counting on lifting
their seven to 14, whilst the jauntiest Labor-
ites reckon on swelling from 18 t;o 25 or 26.
But the safest estimate is the first one, giv-
ing Hayseed a gain of four and Labor two,
which would produce something like a game
of cut-throat euchre, with Hayseed holding
the joker and both bowers.
When McWilliams, to the surprise of
McWilliams, was made leader of the Cocky
party in Federal politics, a disappointed
candidate for the post felt like kicking him-
self down the steps of Parliament House.
His qualifications were considerable, and he
calculated that his best chance of landing the
prize lay in professing a reluctance he didn’t
feel. He was breaking his neck to get it,
but he said he didn’t want it; and the other
Cockies took him at his word.
Faced with the prospect of losing six
seats to the Farmers’ Union or to Labor.
Vic. Liberalism, whose outside organisation
is the National Federation and whose inside
visible combination is the Country (Liberal)
party, is beginning to brace itself up. But
the bracing will be ineffective unless the
Ministry is made more representative of the
whole party, and some of the baekrankers
and non-progressives are shunted. The Pre-
miership is no sinecure, anyhow, and for
once is not being eagerly chased.
“It comes to this,” said an alderman from
Cobar, speaking for the deputation which
asked the N. S. Wales Government to keep
the unpayable mines going, “that the people
of Cobar are waiting for a mob of Jews in
London to suggest how long they are going
to live there, or how long they are going to
exist.” Well, a mob of Jews in London will
yet decide much bigger things than that for
Australia. The position at Cobar is that, if
the mines can be worked to by the help
of a Government which has rarely made any-
thing pay, the place might as well be kept
alive a little longer and any profits be de-
voted to wiping off the debt on the railway.
Otherwise it might as well be abandoned now
as later. The question, if assured profits
can’t be made, is simply whether the Govern-
ment of 1920 will face the problem of finding
new homes for the people or will dribble out
a lot of money to shirk the matter and leave
it to the Government of 1930. And by that
time the mob of Noses in London may have
put in a receiver for something bigger than
Cobar.
BALLADE OF THE SWINGING PROFITEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our minds are mirthless, our souls refuse
To joy as they used to in glad days sped.
We feel that the struggle is no damned use,
And we’re thankful that still we can purchase bread.
But the day will come when we’ll all see red
And take the road with a purpose clear,
For this keeps ringing within my head:
“From the lamp-post swingeth a profiteer.”
We tamely bowed unto Trade’s abuse
While merciless Mars dyed Europe red;
The profiteer preyed and we gave him his dues,
Yea, ten times more if the truth be said.
He has grown too stout on the meat we fed
To his insolent muzzle in hate and ieai';
He leads us a dance, and a dance he will tread —
“From the lamp-post swingeth a profiteer.”
We’ve been like a legion of idiot ewes,
We’ve let ourselves be bullied and bled;
To our hard-earned money we’ve murmured adieux
With sighs, while our hearts have been heavy as
lead.
But just as all hope of relief seems fled,
Remember this—that the time draws near
When trials and troubles shall all be shed—
“ From the lamp-post swingeth a profiteer.”
Bill (of course I mean Mister Hughes),
I know you will share my delight when you hear
The gladdening, hope-raising, glorious news—
“ From the lamp-post swingeth a profiteer!”

At September 30 last paid capital was four
millions and total visible reserves were
£3,340,370. For every £ of these funds the
Bank of N. S. Wales was holding £7 15s. 4d.
of the public’s money. By March 31 last
£765,700 of additional capital had been got
in, and, after payment of dividends, reserves
had been strengthened by over £85,000. But
so rapid has been the expansion of the bank
during the six months that, notwithstanding
this addition of £850,000 of shareholders’
funds, and despite the withdrawal from cir-
culation of £457,000 of the bank’s own notes
in Maoriland, the proportion of liabilities
had only been reduced to £7 12s. 6d. for
each £ of its own funds. In this tfie largest
bank in Australia (the Commonwealth Bank
comes second nowadays, but with all its
holdings of Government cash its deposits are
only two-thirds the size of the Wales’s), the
effects of abnormal conditions arising from
the war might be expected to be more clearly
visible than in most other banks. Since
the term just prior to the world-upheaval its
deposits have expanded £12,717,243, or 34
p.c. During most of that period hundreds
of thousands of the Commonwealth’s best
citizens had been withdrawn from productive
work, and meantime this country Was being
bled by overseas manufacturers and shipping
combines. Yet in those six years of trouble
the Wales’s deposits grew to an extent equal
to the expansion of the previous nine years!
From these figures it would appear that it
pays to indulge in war. It is merely an opti-
cal illusion ; for though, as the man in the
street will tell you, “.there is plenty of
money about,” the banker knows that his
big figures are not by any means all they
look.
Some of the £12,700,000-odd of new de-
posits does, of course, represent additional
wealth which has flowed into the Common-
wealth ; for we, too. have been securing bet-
ter prices for our staples. But the expan-
sion of the figures also includes that portion
of the huge local loan spendings which have
been given into the care of the bank. A
big slice of the war costs represented local
spendings, and of the total outlay of 318
millions 258$ has been loan money, 49 mil-
lions of it having been borrowed from the
British Government. In addition, the State
Governments during the five years to June,
1919, went to Cohen for about 80 millions,
and some of that has also found its way to
the banks. So it boils down to this: that
while total deposits in the Commonwealth
had moved from 154 to 238 millions for the
six years to March 31 last, a considerable
amount of the increase merely represented
the proceeds of visits to the pawnshop.
Under these circumstances, no wonder the
Wales’s management is “watching events
closely,” and, further, that it is also “care-
fully watching the incidence of current de-
posits” and “keeping liquid reserves against
them well in hand.”
Even though the new deposits are not all
they might be, and have, in consequence,
necessitated greater caution, they have pro-
vided bank managements with the where-
withal to earn a great deal more. This com-
parison of balance-sheet figures suggests the
greater profit-earning opportunities of the
Wales compared with the years prior to the
war:—

Premises .. 780,000 800,000 800,000
This bank thus had £7,172,089 more out
in advances than six years ago. The pro-
portion of interest-earning liquid assets was
also much greater than formerly. At March
31, 1914, £5,641,328 was represented by
Government and municipal securities and
short-call money in London; at the latest
balance no less than £15,924,614 was in-
vested in these lines, and rates of interest
are much higher than six years ago. In
relation to the amount of shareholders’ funds
in the business, disclosed net profits are,
however, smaller than they used to be. But
when the last accounts were produced
drought conditions prevailed over a very wide
area, and because of that trouble and
abnormal conditions otherwise the directors
made no secret of _the fact that they “con-
tinue to make large provisions for contin-
gencies.” Even so, there was a wide margin
between the amount required for the 10 p.c.
div. and disclosed net earnings. For the
reasons set out above, and particularly be-
cause of the large proportion of outside
money in the business compared with the
extent of the bank’s own funds, everything
favors the earning of large profits, despite
the fact that taxes now call for an amount
equal to one-third of the year’s disclosed net
profits.
The Bank of N. S. Wales continues to
hold a large proportion of its liabilities in
more or less liquid form. Regarding the
Government-guaranteed wheat advances and
War Loan accommodation to customers as
liquid, almost 64 p.c. of all liabilities to the
public was, at March 31, covered by cash,
Government pa.per, etc. That left slightly
over 22$ millions, which were protected by
30 millions of advances and premises with
a book value of £BOO,OOO. But besides that
visible protection there is a vast internal
reserve of unknown dimensions.

The Assurance and Thrift has an unusual
record for a young life office. When the
books closed on March 31 it had completed
10 years in business, every year from the
commencement shareholders have had a div.,
and, since the management paid its way as
it went, no organisation or establishment
account has marred the balance-sheets. In
other words, at all times shareholders’ capi-
tal has been fully represented by the book
value of tangible assets. Naturally, under
these circumstances, the volume of business
handled has not been extensive; but the
directors have no apologies to offer. They
remark that the “modest dimensions” of the
figures are “due to the extreme difficulties
which have attended the working up of the
business on sound lines.” The co. set out
principally to do house-purchase insurance,
a side-line which has proved popular else-
where but which had not been exploited in
the Commonwealth. Just about the time
when an increasing number of policies had
been in force long enough to qualify for an
advance to the holder to build a home, the
war upset calculations, and since the first
duty of a life co. is to make certain
of its security for policy-holders this man-
agement wisely limited its risks. Present
abnormal conditions demand caution on the
part of an insurance co., for though house-
property values have continued to soar
there are obvious dangers in a boom result-
ing from over five-years of heavy loan ex-
penditure. Consequently the Assurance and
Thrift has made no effort to expand its
house-purchase insurance interests, though
probably conditions have never been so
favorable for capturing this class of policy-
holder.
At March 31 advances totalled £49.292,
or £1665 in excess of total assurance funds
in the life and home-purchase department.
Besides these funds there was, of course,
the paid capital of £17,684, and also reserves
totalling £2725. Well managed, the house-
property business is profitable; interest earn-
ings on this co.’s average funds (including
shareholders’ capital) for the past year
worked out at over 5| p.c. But there are
other sources of profit also. The manage-
ment has been dealing in property; for in-
stance, a couple of years ago it set about
providing Newcastle with a garden suburb,
and surpluses over book values have resulted
from the subdivision. But the management
is looking at this class of business with a
cautious eye, and operations are anparently
on a smaller scale than formerly. Altogether,
during the 10 years over £12,000 'of profits
has been made from property investments,, an
amount practically equal to total claims
and surrenders in all departments during
the same period. The latest balance-sheet
also shows a profit of £712 on investments
realised, and the entry “Profit on exchange,
£126,” hints that the management has done
a little successful dabbling in the world’s
chaotic money markets.
The security afforded policy-holders is,
of course, the matter of chief concern in
post-morteming a life co.’s accounts. It
will have been noted that the Assurance
and Thrift’s assets are not of the gilt-edged
variety. Nevertheless, policy liabilities are
apparently well covered. Valuations are made
triennially, and the next one is not due until
the close* of the current year. Recently,
however, a progress actuarial valuation was
made, and results are recorded as “satisfac-
tory,” and the management talks of policy-
holders participating in a distribution after
the next balance. Thus the actuary indi-
cates that the assurance funds are more
than ample to meet estimated liabilities. But
if the whole of the £47.627 of those funds
is necessary to cover policy liabilities, there
is still a wide margin for contingencies, net
assets being valued at £67,315. Put another
way, 29 p.c. of the book value of assets
would have to be lost before policies were
imperilled. Even then there would be the
£30,369 of uncalled capital to fall back upon.
The matter can also be looked at. from an-
other angle. The management has proved
itself to be of the cautious type (the man-
aging-director is W. R. Dovey, a tried
actuary), and there is every reason to be-
lieve that as great care has been exercised
in laying out funds as in writing new busi-
ness. Further, the co.’s debtors are also its
policy-holders.
The Assurance and Thrift is also doing
accident and fire business, the latter pro-
bably mostly with its house-purchase policy-
holders. Evidently the management has not
been noshing either class of business. Last
year £827 of fire premiums was collected,
but there was not a single claim to meet.
Accident and sickness business brought in
£3OB of premiums, and only £27 was re-
quired to meet claims. Expanses, however,
were very heavy, absorbing no less than 88
p.c. of total income, which hints that this
branch is carrying charges that more rightly
should have been debited to the main busi-
ness. In the life and house-purchase branch
exes, (exclusive of the dividend) absorbed
32 p.c. of total income; or, including the
div. (lifted to 6 p.c. for the first time), the
outlay represented 37 p.c. of income.

Drought exes, written off, £25,000 ) ° ’ 0
Disclosed net earnings for the past 12
months were smaller than for any year
since 1908; and if portion of the £25,000
drought exes, now being written off be
charged against the latest figures results are
even poorer-looking. After providing £4405
to pay a bonus on 1919 salaries and £2OOO
for the staff provident fund, net profits (dis-
regarding the year’s additional drought costs)
are shown at £94,097, so the 15 p.c. dividend
was not nearly earned. But recent years
have been so very fat that the directors have
not hesitated to cut into reserves to feed
shareholders. In their report, the directors
are not at all communicative about their
troubles; but the two years’ drought must
have made the co.’s own holdings feel sick.
Nevertheless, the pastoral-agency side of
the business has been very sweet —and, be-
cause of the Government backing, very easy.
During the past year 125,095 bales of wool
were handled (compared with 135,955 for
1919), and because of high prices fat com-
missions have been collected on that turn-
over. In addition, though nothing is said
on the subject, a tidy bit has, no doubt, been
earned frpm handling metals. Anyhow, gross
profits for the year, after providing for bad
debts, etc. —and only those right inside know
how much was clipped off for etceteras —
amounted to £299,901, compared with
£359,317 for 1919 and £366,644 for 1918.
One way and another the co. has done
extremely well despite the drought. And
whatever damage has been sustained as a
result of the recent long dry period is pretty
•eertain to be more than made good during
the years of plenty which invariably follow.
A week or two ago the outlook was black,
but recent rains have given every indication
that the back-country is about to experience
another very rapid recovery. On this occa-
sion, however, this and other cos. have un-
usual opportunities in prospect, because of
the boom markets. How remarkable have
been the recoveries of the past is illustrated
by this comparison of Goldsbrough Mort s
balance-sheet figures:—
1901. 1910. 1920.
Capital .. .. £558,995 £558,995 £773,010
Reserves., .. 3,459 357,195 716,447

Premises, etc. . . 370,815 244,368 212.803
Other assets .. 1,765 11,770 64,105
That comparison goes back to the time when
the last of several reconstructions was
effected, shareholders’ and debenture-holders*
capital having been written down. The co.
had got into a frightful mess in the
’nineties, and many holders deserted rather
than face the liabilities which their shares
entailed. There were many sore heads and
much grinding of teeth when it was dis-
covered that things were not as bad as they
had been Painted; but that is all ancient
historv now. The growth of reserves by
over £353.000 between 1901-10, after pay-
ment of divs. aggregating almost 43 p.c. on
written-down capital, indicates the amazing
recovery the co. made for those who were
plucky enough, or who were knowing enough,
to retain their interests. The past 10 years
have provided a much more sumptuous ban-
quet. The table shows paid capital to have
expanded £214,015 during that period, and
every penny of this addition has represented
capitalised reserves. Meantime shareholders
have had £1,065,000-odd in dividends, repre-
senting a return of 190 p.c. on paid capital
as it stood prior to the capitalisation of pro-
fits ; and while this has happened, after
allowing for the £25,000 appropriated to meet
recent drought losses and after providing
for the recent final dividend, disclosed re-
serves had expanded approximately £312,000.
Much of this has resulted from realisations
of properties, etc., and, as the table shows,
the book value of these assets is now over
half a million less than 10 years ago. That
means, of course, that the prosperity of past
yfears cannot be taken as a guide to the
future. But because of this reduction in
property-holdings Goldsbrough Mort’s is
nowadays a much-changed concern.
One feature of the eo.’s accounts is the
small volume of “other liabilities.” All but
£118.411 of the £3,112,516 in the business
at March 31 last Avas permanently on the
premises; and much of it is cheap money:
£904,405 representing 4 p.c. interminable de-
bentures and £600,243 5 p.c. of the same
class of capital. The co. is in the very
healthy condition of having a surplus of cash,
deposits and public securities over and above
all outside liabilities exceeding £529,044.
Last year authorised capital was increased
from £798.565 to a million, but so far, pro-
bably because of the drought, the directors
have not disclosed their motives in seeking
the increase. Not unlikely there is a further
capitalisation of reseiwes in prospect, which
will have the effect of making the distribu-
tions to shareholders less liable to attack.
The present div. rate is actually equal to
only slightly o\ r er 8 p.c. on shareholders’
funds, and since much of the resenm repre-
sents recoveries froin old disasters and is
not stored-up trading profit there is some
justification for giving the dividend distri-
butions a less obese appearance.

This is not a talkative co. and leaves many
things unsaid which might well be told in-
vestors, though probably the co. is mostly
a family concern and therefore says as little
about itself as the special Act under which
it operates permits. To begin with, there is
not even a hint as to why the past year’s net
profits should be practically equal to those
of any previous two years. The latest report
and accounts are even less communicative
than usual, for whereas in the past commis-
sions, interest earnings and sundry side-line
revenue have been shown separately, in the
latest sheet all are lumped, the year’s
revenue being shown as £13,330, compared
with last year’s total of £9586. The year’s

juS/i f Ol £BOO \ it may be more. But the
±5044 shown in the table is equal to over
42 p.c. of the paid capital of £12,500, £3125
ot which represents reserves capitalised only
three years ago. This very handsome return
is surprising in view of the competition of
the State Trustee, who is not out to make big
profits and has during recent years actually
been sharing what he has made with clients.
1 robably its special Act gives it power to
do other things besides general trustee work
(by the way, the extent of its trustee busi-
ness is not disclosed), and this no doubt
explains the heavy liabilities which show up
in the accounts. Total shareholders’ funds
at the balance amounted to £33,186, but the
co. owed no jess than £77,017. The set-off
against this item on the other side was the
£65,647 due by sundry debtors. Other assets
are a mixture of mortgages, leaseholds and
buildings, £11,909 ; debentures (unspecified),
£19,100; cash, etc., £9966; and odds and
ends, £5BO. At a distance, the co. looks a
surprising success; but that, no doubt, is due
mostly to family ties, and so long as it
retains the family confidence it will continue
to prosper.
The Dunlop Rubber Co. of Austral-
asia, Ltd.—This co. had a reconstruction
only four years ago, but the “continued
expansion of the business, and anticipated
further developments, render most (desir-
able an increased capital,” and the directors
consider the “best mode of dealing with the
position” is another reconstruction. Pre-
sent authorised capital is 1} millions, of
which £1,120,000 has been issued, 200,000
£1 shares being 7 p.c. cum. prefs., 90..000
9 p.c. and 230,000 10 p.c. prefs. (both non-
eumulative), and 600,000 7 p.c. ordinaries.
The 7 and 9 p.c. prefs. and ords. have been
participating shares, for if profits permitted
the former could (and did) receive 10 p.c.
and the ordinaries an extra point simul-
taneously, all remaining profits being avail-
able for the ordinaries. So far as the prefs.
are concerned it is now proposed to cut all
distinctions, putting all in one class carry-
ing 10 p.c. cumulative. Nominal capital is
to be three millions, comprising the 520.000'
10 p.c. cum. prefs. and 2,480,000 £1 ordi-
naries. Besides receiving share for share
in the new co., the prefs. also receive one
bonus ordinary share for every 10 prefs.
now held, with the right to apply, at par,
for one further ordinary. The ordinaries
are to receive share for share, together with
four bonus shares for every 10 held and
with the right to take up four more at par.
So the new paid capital will be made up in
this way:—
Prefs. Ordinaries.
Old scrip replaced by new . . £520.000 £600,000
Bonus shares to Prefs. .. - 52,000
Bonus shares to Ords. .. 240,000
To be subscribed .. .. —*• 292,000
£520,000 £1,184,000
Thus £292,000 of fresh capital will be got in
and a similar amount of reserves capitalised.
The present extent of the reserves is un-
known, but a year ago, including taxation
reserve (which may not have been called
upon) over £160,000 was in hand. To pay
10 p.c. all round on the enlarged capital
will call for £170,000. and last year’s dis-
closed profits exceeded that by £7OOO-odd.
The directors declare that the rights be-
stowed upon both classes of shares by the
re-shuffle “provide a fair and .equitable
adjustment as between all concerned.”

The money market is a little easier in
Melbourne than it is in Sydney, and the
Board of Works has raised locally £250.000
at 5| p.c. As it was offered at a discount
of 1 per cent, and exes, had to be met, the
average price was £9B 12s. Bd. The tenure is
10 years.

The Greater Wondergraph Co. in Adelaide
has successfully run off a £90,000 issue of
debentures at 8 per cent. Shareholders took
more than half, and the balance was
snapped by the public. There is soft money
in the picture business at present; but with
a turn in the tide it is not easy to see the
projected Rundle-street house getting back
all the £55,000 paid for land and nearly
£40,000 proposed to be spent in building.
* * * *
The Commonwealth Bank withdrew its
support from Mt. Cuthbert (Q.), and there
was nothing left to do but close down. It
seems that the directors wanted £BO per
ton backing for their blister; and with the
world’s market only a couple of pounds
better than that Denison Miller drew back.
The qo. has had wretched luck, perhaps its
worst stroke coming when it was refused
permission to sell its copper to Japan at a
great price. Even to-day it has 2000 tons
tied up, and at £BO per ton that means
more than fourpence. But Hughes has to
“solve the metal problem” even if every
mining co. in Australia is smashed in the
process.
Austral Malay, which pursues new tin
areas and foster-mothers them to the flota-
tion stage, but works no properties on its
own account, had a dull time last year in
seeking new ground. None of the offerings
warranted active prospecting, and at present
only one property is under consideration.
However, two new mining-engineers have
been engaged to prospect., and since the
resources _ of. Malaya “are by no means ex-
hausted, it is likely that new payable pro-
perties will continue to be found.” During
the year to December 31 last the co. suc-
cessfully launched the Ulu Yam, the con-
sideration being £7500 cash (which was
practically all absorbed by prospecting costs
and preliminary exes.) and 25,000 fully-
paid £1 shares. Besides this interest the
Austral Malay has an £BOOO holding in
Ivampong Kamunting (from which a very
sweet £3400 in divs. flowed during the year),
and it nurses 22,525 £1 fully-paids. in the
Asam Kumbang, to which it has also loaned
£7OOO. This latter concern has had a good
run since it began tin-winning in October
last. Ivampong divs. are earmarked for
prospecting expenditure, and the Kumbang
returns will provide Austral Malay share-
holders with divs.; and since the interest in
that concern exceeds the Austral Malay’s
paid capital of £20.000, the Is. 6d. per share
about to be distributed by Kumbang will
give Austral Malay holders a similar dis-
tribution. Ruwolt’s are busy on Ulu Yam’s
dredge, and that plant, capable of 80,000
cub. yd. per month, should be in commis-
sion within 12 months. So, if everything
works out well, Austral Malay will liave a
third div.-earner to feed it.
Marshall’s Tambaroora is a pup of the
recent Hill End (N.S.W.) flutter. Charles
Alder is the holder of 11 acres on the noi-th-
ern end of the field, where are numerous
holes in which the old-timers burrowed until
the gold cut out. Because in Hawkin’s Hill
kindly country has again shown up beyond
the barren zone, and because of the recent
rich strike by Amalgamated, the Tamba-
roora floaters want to look for recurrences
in this northern end. The Marshall
brothers “firmly believe” that the old Val-
entine reef has merely dropped back into
the parallel reefs which lie to the west, and
they suggest crosscutting 100 ft. from the
Valentine mine’s old shaft. Also they talk
in mixed tenses
In addition to this rich golden zone—
evidently the one. they are “very confident”
of meeting—
there are large bodies of milling ore rip to 14ft. in
wjdth. which have been mined down to water-level
with liighly-profitable results. For each additional
50ft. sunk in the main shaft, with necessary levels,
many thousands of tons of these ore bodies will
undoubtedly become available for extraction, which
will show a considerable profit when handled with a
modern plant and methods.
So Marshall’s Tambaroora in 100,000 shares
of 3s. each is set afloat, the public being
invited to subscribe 50,000, to be paid to
Is. for a start, the vendor (Alder) taking
40,000 paid to 25.. and also £lOOO of the
£2500 the public subscribes for his leases and
a 10-hd. battery. The Marshalls consider
£2OOO ample to “satisfactorily test” the theory
of a recurrence. If nothing comes of that,
presumably the flow of calls will cease, and
the “many thousands of tons of ore bodies”
will remain untouched and the stampers
maintain silence. The prospectus reveals
Marshall’s Tambaroora as merely a pros-
pecting venture, and as such it does not war-
rant £lOOO of the cash subscribed going to
the vendor or the acquisition of the vendor’s
battery.

After spending £5200 on -preliminary
development—-which, says mining-engineer
E. W. Bonwick, “has been honestly carried
out,” the owners, foif the first time in his
experience, having been “really anxious to
ascertain true values”—the holders of ,75
acres nine miles from Gundagai are floating
the Cl ark-Wesley G. M. Co. A lode 3100 ft.
long has been proved and exploration on
550 ft. of the reef from five shafts, varying
in depth to 100 ft., has indicated an ore
body from sft. to 10ft., wide, which, “care-
fully sampled,” has averaged from 12dwt.
to over the ounce. Bonwick talks of the
chances of a continuous run of 1000 ft. of ore
averaging 19dwt., which, assuming a width
of 6ft., would yield 50,000 tons for every
100 ft. of sinking. Since it is a complex ore
(silica, iron, arsenic and sulphur show in
the concentrates), he emphasises the neces-
sity for a modern plant, at the same time
impressing that “nothing less than complete
exploitation at 100 ft., together with. sys-
tematic exploration by vertical workings
down to 200 ft., should be sufficient” to war-
rant such a plant. This work he estimates
to cost not less than £ll,OOO, and he thinks
the outlay would be justified. Of hundreds
of deposits Bonwick has inspected in N. S.
Wales he gives the Clark-Wesley the prize
for “inducements in the matter of apparent
continuity, width and values.” The co. is
to have a nominal capital of £BO,OOO, of
which 40,000 £1 shares, to be paid to 10s. for
a start, are offered to the public, the re-
maining 40,000 going as fully-paid to ven-
dors and the 50 backers who financed pre-
liminary development.

Adelong Gold Estates (N.S.W.) shows
surplus assets of £15,986, £6500 more than
six months back. It is well soi, for bores
indicate that ahead a narrow run of wash
will limit yields from the No. 2 plant. The
ground worked since the hard times of 1917
has panned out well: —
No. 1 dredge. No. 2 dredge.
Oct., 1917 . . 6.080 d. 13.206 d.
Apl., 1918 .. 7.557 d. 9.407 d.
Oct., 1918 . . 7.170 d. 5.027 d.
Apl., 1919 .. 6.442 d. 5.440 d.
Oct., 1919 . . 5.986 d. 5.424 d.
Apl., 1920 . . 7,921 d. 7.913 d.
With such yields better dividends should
have come along. But dredge parts can be
got only at ruinous prices, while fuel and
stores are now expensive. Stoppages, too,
cut down dredge efficiency to about 64 p.c.
of the hours worked. So costs for No. 1,
instead of being about the 4d. line last half-
year,. went above 6d., and No. 2 moved from
3.886 d. to nearly sd. Next to wages repairs
is the big item in dredging, the two amount-
ing to £4610 and £5395 respectively. Roughly
it takes £4lO per week —about lOOoz. gold—
to cover current outgo. If No. 2 plant is
to run into poor ground, fhe co. is in luck
by being nearly £16,000 on the right side.
During the past six months Estates won
£15,430 of gold, but the accounts show a
revenue of £21,868, the difference no doubt
being accounted for by gold premiums.

Hampton (W.A.) has reached the sack-
cloth and ashes stage. Scores of wild-cats
have been abandoned, and many others are
about to be quitted. Hampton Plains is now
left with five mines showing visible means of
support, but there is no certainty that any
one of them is going to last. Even the White
Hope, which still looks the best, will have
to demonstrate by development that values
extend over some length before any more
eulogies can be written about it. The same
remark applies to the tricky Mutooroo,
whose shoot has so far proved to be very
limited and disturbed. Celebration, though
poor and menaced by porphyry below 100 ft.,
is expected to improve in the sulphide zone;
but as a new shaft will have to be sunk
perhaps to nearly 250 ft. to reach that point,
there will be a long wait before its chances
are known. The co. has about ss. per share
in hand, and approximately £BO,OOO to
£lOO,OOO worth of gold above 100 ft. The
Golden Hope, with 80-odd feet of driving in
payable ore at water-level to its credit, is
given a chance, and so is the big low-grade
Pernatty. Outside these five and a few con-
tiguous blocks nothing else on the Plains
is fancied.

The supply of new finds having been ex-
hausted, attempts are now being made to
float some old Westralian gold shows. Two
of these are the Augusta, at Laver ton, and
the Ingliston, at Meekatharra. The former
has been marketed twice since it was aban-
doned years ago by the London Golden Rhine
Co., and on each occasion the public lost
its money. The worst that can be said
against the Ingliston is that the best of the
ore in three levels has been extracted.
* * * *
The report of Westralian Government
expert Blatchford on Mt. Monger bears out
all that this page has long suspected of
the field. Blatchford declares it to be a
place of isolated ore-patches and short shoots
possessing erratic values and no lines of
lodes.

Lass o’ Gowrie (W.A. 1 vendors have de-
cided to accept much less than the price
originally agreed upon. But whether they
will ever get any more than the deposit
already paid is another matter. The best
thing for the co. to do would be to get a
mining-engineer of standing to report on the
property, and if, as anticipated, he expressed
no faith in its permanency, to wind up and
give shareholders what is left.
* •* * *
Boulder No. 1 is also reconstructing. It
is proposed to increase the share issue from
225,000 to 450,000, but this is contingent
on portions of Block 45, Hampton Plains, on
which options have been secured, proving
satisfactory. If they do, the vendors are to
be given 112,500 shares in exchange for the
properties.
Kanowna Red Hill (W.A.) proposes to
enlarge itself from a co. with 500 shares to
one of 100,000 shares, of which the vendors
and promoters /will receive about one-third
and the present shareholders 50 shares for
every one now held, with the right of
acquiring 50 more at 2s. 6d. each. The mine
has a good production record and it still has
fair values in sight.
* * * *
Riverina South (W.A.), which hitherto
has been unable to obtain enough gold to
pay its way, now complains of the difficulty
of securing sufficient labor. A resumption
of ore treatment is promised at an early
date, but the prospect of shareholders ever
getting anything is doubtful. The show
seems to be of the class which provides suffi-
cient employment to maintain a few pub-
and store-keepers, and is unlikely to return
any of the capital put into it.

Irvinebank (N.Q.) is making no progress
towards recovering the position it held a
few years ago. The State has been in pos-
session of the crushing, concentrating and
smelting works for some months now, and.
has even added a State store, which has
been an apparent success —from the miners’
point of view, anyhow, as it has reduced
prices. There have been a few rich re-
turns —notably from Struber’s Perseverance,
Tait Bros’, show and a couple of others;
but, after all, these are either worked by
the owners or employ very little labor. The
latest jolt is the decision of the sole remain-
ing bank to close its branch this month. The
Vulcan mine, for years Irvinebank’s great
standby, is waterlogged, and although at-
tempts are being made to revive it, nothing
has yet been done.
Glengarry, Clonbinane (Vic.), has at its
disposal John Northey, £52 in cash and some
calling power to sink from 95ft. to 200 ft.
Work at 95ft. was always in poor stuff, but
the directors testify that a “fine reef” is
hidden underfoot. Minister Barnes, who
hates to say no to a liard-up mine, has lent
£5OO, and this and the presence of Northey
at the mine suggest that the unexpected is
looked for.
* * * *
Homeward Bound Bon Accord, Yackan-
dandah, is a decent little show in one of
Vic.’s neglected quartz spots. The locals
are busy finding out what is under the main
crosscut at 145 ft., where a winze is proving
a bigger lode than was expected, and it
gives decent values, too. But the show needs
shaking up,_ for so long as only 1000 or so
tons are milled each half-year there won’t
be much in it, unless plum-pudding stuff is
about, and that has not happened since Bon
Accord ran its early course.

The Countess de Rossi, widow of the fiery
gentleman who barricaded himself in the
Goulburn Cathedral and defied the church
authorities 34 years ago, died in Sydney the
other day. The incident referred to arose
out of a dispute between Archdeacon Puddi-
combe and Bishop
Thomas, Rossi be-
ing a supporter of
the Archdeacon.
The Count held the
fort valiantly, com-
pelling those who
wished to use the
church to climb
through a window
until he was
handed over to the
police; and the
whole State was
interested in the
curious conflict.
He was much older
than the just-dead
lady, being 62 at
the time when he
set the church in
an uproar.

THE PRINCE’S SHADOW IN
AUSTRALIA .
The luck of Davey Hall continues. He
stays in England, having dropped into a
comfortable job as London rep. of a ship-
ping co. Hall’s luck started when, as a
youngster, he made himself useful to Holman,
who never forgets a friend. It stuck to him
when he got away before the downfall of
the Holman Government; and although the
cancellation of his appointment as A.-G.
looked as if Fortune was frowning on her
favorite at last, she is giving him the glad
eye again.
William England Bourne, who died on
Friday near Sydney, aged 87, wore one of
five Methodist collars that came to Syd-
ney early in 1864. All five completed' a
50-years’ residence, but only three remained
in the ,Methodist ministry—Stead, Sellers
and Bourne. Manning went over to the
Anglicans and Brentnall joined the Bris-
bane Telegbaph. At 86 Brentnall is the
survivor of the five. He, by the way, was
the parson at the marriage of the Tieh-
borne claimant at Wagga.
Alfred Vaughan is one of the veterans
South Aus. thinks it cdn’t do without. He
is nearly 71, and should ldst week have
dropped out of his billet as Government
photo-lithographer, but was ordered to
stay on for another year. His whole life’s
work has been associated with the office,
which since 1868 he has helped to make the
effective thing it now is. A 7 aughan is the
father of Crawford and J.H., and is doubt-
less the only man who ever saw his sons
and a son-in-law a full half of a Ministry.
That remarkable organiser and propa-
ganda-artist, C. J. DeGaris, of the Dried
Fruit, dropped into Adelaide last week per
the flying-machine by which he proposes to
do his travelling. His first flight was adven-
turous. He left Melbourne on Tuesday
morning, and got to Lascelles (Vic.) ; home
at Mildura, on the Murray, early on Wed-
nesday, and away again at lunch-time;
slept at Pyap (S.A.) and ran into a storm,
which meant a detour and a landing at
Port Elliot, away down by the Murray
mouth ; Adelaide before dusk. But as a regu-
lar thing De Garis reckons on getting from
Mildura to Adelaide in two and a half hours.
Samuel A\ 7 alker Griffith, now in retirement
at Brisbane, spent his 75th birthday on a
sick bed, and he is still very ill. It is
57 years since he graduated at Sydney Uni.,
53 since he was called to the Brisbane Bar,
48 since he was elected for East Moreton,
46 since he was made Attorney-General, 37
since he became Premier of Queensland —
and then it was that he attended the Con-
vention at Sydney and drafted the Federal
Council Bill, as, eight years later, he drafted
a Commonwealth Bill. Parkes, Robertson
and Mcllwraith. Barton. Deakin and King-
ston —the fine old man, Welsh-born, Austra-
lian-bred, has outlived them all.
“Author”: Since seeing Billy Hughes
recently, I have come to the conclusion that
the last line in a set of Bulletin verse of
the other day, headed “Fever,” is a mis-
print. It ran: “Pain herds her haggard
ewes.” For “ewes” read “Hughes.”
Thomas Grimes, who has just gone west
at Toowoomba (Q.), aged 84, was one of
the survivors of the wreck of the Netherby
on King Island in 1866. He and his wife
and- child and others got ashore and lived
a Robinson Crusoe kind of life on the speck-
let for some time before they were taken
off, and reached Melbourne. He was one of
the earliest settlers at Clifton (Q.).
Graham Berry was too much in earnest
as the foremost Radical of his day to ever
make a joke; and he never saw one that
anyone else made. Once when he went
to Ballarat to support his henchman,
Major Smith, a number of local
Conservatives played an elaborate trick
on him. Berry, it must be remem-
bered, was a Geelong grocer. The
joke consisted of bribing the hall-
keeper to arrange the long table on
the platform to look as much like a
counter as possible, and then, when
the Premier was on his legs, a string
of the enemy started for the platform,
bearing grocery parcels—sugar, butter,
cheese, salt, soap, etc. This pile of
goods they arranged on the table,
wished Berry many happy returns of
the day, and passed down into the
hall again. Berry regarded the pro-
ceedings with the utmost solemnity.
Standing like a grocer among his
stock, he made a rousing speech, and
concluded with thanks to the friends
who had handed him these generous
presents; but he wished to point out
that there was a mistake with regard
to his birthday, which was on the
fifth of the following month. “How-
ever,” said he, “I shall be most happy
to pass your gifts on to the Ballarat
Benevolent Asylum.” The result was
that the local asylum received by cab
that night, with Graham Berry’s com-
pliments, numerous parcels of pipeclay
made up like flour, sand packed like
sugar, clay done up as soap, and
cheese, etc./ and Berry was sternly
rebuked by the Star for playing an unseemly
practical joke on a £reat charitable institu-
tion.
When his Excellency Lieut.-Governor
Lennon, of Queensland, Went to Rockhamp-
ton recently, he was- met on arrival by a
Chinese taxi-man. The returned soldiers
on the rank cheered wildly.
Enter for the most-thoughtful-man prize
John D. Gleeson, of Geelong (Vic.). He
bequeathed his body to Melbourne Uni. for
dissection, and then not only committed
suicide, so that the legacy might not be
unduly delayed, but did it by drowning him-
self in the bath so that everything might be
clean and in order and no mess made.
Many a friendly Digger has hailed the
Prince as “Teddy,” but only two persons in
Australia call him “Edward.” They are the
small daughters of Governor Davidson, of
N. S. Wales, and
were ordered so to
address him by the
jovial youth. On
his birthday morn-
ing they knocked at
his door each with
a posy and a shy
“Many happy re-
turns of the day,
Edward,” and there
was moisture in
his eyes as he ac-
knowledged the
gifts. He confessed
to feeling homesick
for the first time
since he landed in
Australia. It was
the only birthday
he had ever spent
away from home
and mother.
SIR ARCHI-
BALD WEIGALL,
S'Australia’s new
Governor.
Charles D’Ebro, who died the other day
at Perth, was one of the best-known archi-
tects and engineers in the Commonwealth.
During the last quarter-century he had
specialised in the construction of abattoirs,
freezing works and wool stores, and four
times had been sent by big clients to
America to bring back any new ideas dis-
coverable in handling the assassinated jum-
buck. Freezing works at Geelong, several
in Banana]and and the abattoirs at Adel-
aide and Newcastle were designed by him,
and when N. S, Wales Ministers wanted
the truth about the monumental muddle
at Homebush it was D’Ebro they sent for.
In earlier times he was a partner of the
father of Percy Grainger, and it was they
who designed Princes Bridge. He was 70
at the end. Long ago, after having learned
his job in a Government Department in
Adelaide, he married a daughter of Dr.
Tracey, a leading sawbones in Collins-
street in the pre-Fitzgerald era. There is
one daughter of a father who was white all
through.
THE DELEGATES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I. —Then.
1 spruit a year in Junee,
I spent a year in Bourke;
And one I spent revising
The year I spent in work.
They seemed so close together
They nearly broke my heart;
And yet those fateful two years
Were twenty years apart.
Oh, down the Lachlan River
Where father used to camp,
The old grey horse is missing
And I'm too old to tramp.
No Union flag was flying,
Because it never flew;
The cause was dead or dying
Round Bourke in ’ninety-two.
Through bogs of sodden black soil
We fell back, down and done,
Heart-broken from the battle
We’d lost in ’ninety-one.
From Union camps of hunger,
And cold and sodden beds,
Our leaders followed after;
Black-listed at the sheds,
They tramped and worked for tucker
To live for higher aims;
And round the furthest stations
Shore under other names.
Oh, greybeard meeting greybeardl
Oh, hearts of younger' men!
’Tis long since I was called by
The name I “went by” then.
We’d meet and know each other—
No matter how we knew;
We'd spies amongst the squatters
Right back in ’ninety-two;
And safer than the wireless,
Or any means for hire,
And surer were the messages
We sent by mulga wire.
Tall, gaunt and quaintly solemn,
To mask the lurking grin,
Matilda up at sunset,
Our delegate came in;
He’d look the rep. up (casual),
And, after tea, perhaps,
He’d say by light of slush-lamp
“A few words to you chaps.”
The few short words were spoken.
And mulga’d further on ;
The shed-bell rang at sunrise—
Our delegate was gone.
No par. was in the Herald,
He wrote not to the - Sun
To tell the world what he had
Or what he had not done.
We had no grand head-office,
Where staffs are mild and meek.
And bosses fight for freedom
On fifteen pounds a week ;
Where pen-cranks blur the lessons
We’d learned in ’ninety-three,
And well-dressed Union bullies
Bludge on Democracy.
Headquarters then were anywhere
Where headquarters might be—
The skillion of a shanty
Or underneath a tree.
In sheep or cattle country,
Drought-blaze or freezing rain,
Oh! there we fought the battles
We’ll have to fight again!
’Way down the Murrumbidgee
And up the Lachlan side
Are young bay horses saddled —
I’m not too old to ride.
ll.—Now.
I spent a year in Junee,
The railway runs to Hay,
And up at Cootamundra
It runs the other way.
And there are many hardships
And many wrongs to meet;
But puppy politicians
Go on to Spencer-street.
(Ah me! in all this weary world,
Of all the lines that run
There is no line that runs to Bourke
In eighteen-ninety-one.)
They come from much or nothing,
Blue or plebeian blood;
But mostly from their cad-hood
Their beds are soft as mud.
But certes there’s no doubting
They’re fitted for their job—
Born with the gift of spouting
The obvious to the mob.
No great ideas they pilfer,
Because they never heed ;
They steal no words of wisdom,
Because they never read;
If higher lights should beacon
They always keep in mind,
For the safety of their Billets,
The level of their kind!
They work a small man’s mischief
And draw a big man’s screw—
We’ll never know how little,
Or how much harm they do,
Till their conceit unseats them—
An end that’s always plain—
And they go “organising”
Or “whispering” again.
Oh! they outblight all blighters
In tram or motor-car —
Exploit then drop the writers
Who put them where they are.
They’re first to stumble over
Their big splay feet and say
“Me Lord!” likewise “Yer Lordship!”
For ever and a day.
They travel first and sleeper,
At sea they go saloon—
They go without a keeper,
But they shall need one soon.
They buzz where strife is stirring
Like flies to rotten meat;
It is their Billets and the soul
Of pitiful Conceit.
’Tis all tone and no tucker
The pubs they call their own—
The pubs wherein we rested
Were tucker and no tone.
The greatest mateship treaty
AVas signed, when we grew strong,
In Mother Minty’s shanty
Down by the Billabong.
And oh! to see the lounging
In smoke-rooms free of charge!
And oh! to watch the apeing
Of gentlemen at large!
The playful condescending
To empty-headed girls;
And hear the patronising
Of hards who dined with earls.
They have a separate table
Wherever they may go,
And boast that they are able
To keep their gulls in tow;
They shout, or else they mutter,
They tolerate or hate,
They drag down to the gutter
The name of delegate.
They shame the honest memory
Of working mums and dads;
They simply have- the minds without
The dirt of “undercads.”
They scamp the Grand Old Union’s work,
Ragtime the songs we sung;
Ah me! ’Twas well that Donald
Macdonell died so young.
A grey ghost jar behind us-
The old grey horse that glides,
North, south and eastward veering,
No spectral horseman rides.
N.s.w.
HENRY LAWSON.

The Studebaker Net of Knowledge
IT has been told how the Studebaker designers and
engineers plan and build from personally-gained
experiences. But it remains to explain that these
experts do more. They are, individually and collec-
tively, receiving and classifying centres for knowledge
drawn from every quarter of the Studebaker motoring
world.
This priceless knowledge is obtained by casting a net of
attentive observation and inquiry over, practically, the
whole of Motordom. Every Studebaker dealer and
every one of thousands of Studebaker owners is a
source of information —a separate “listening-post”—
beyond the front trenches of Industry.
A marvellous store of knowledge is the harvest of this
scientific fishery, and, when this knowledge is classified
and sifted and filtered, the precious facts recovered are!
applied to add a new lustre to the already shining
reputation of the Studebaker Car.

A. FALSE ALARM.
WIFEY: “Oh, George , I’m seared to death
that it’s coming off.”
HUBBY: “Heavens, woman, can’t you hitch
it up with a rope or Something?”
WIFEY: “Not my dress, stupid! 1 mean my
sister’s engagement to that horrid, fat
Smith man.”
“Fag”: It was after the Flanders business
that she came into our ward —a tall, buxom
matron in grey, with an unfashionable hat
and a graceful carriage. She was un-
announced and unescorted, and she had a
trick of repeating the last word of our answer
to her question, which was the usual thing.
“On which front did you get your wound?”
she asked Lance-corporal Waddy. “Wipers,
missus,” was the reply. “At Eep’r,” she
rejoined, giving the word the correct French
and Walloon sound, then novel to us and
a source of mirth. “And where were you
hurt?”—this to Private Hooker. “At Ee-per,
mum. “Ah! Eep’r. And you. young man,”
proceeding to the bedside of Sergeant-major
Pipeclay, who prided himself on his Parisian
accent. “At Ee-pray, madam,” replied Ser-
geant-major Pipeclay. “Eep’r,” the lady said.
Distributing “Eep’rs” right and left she
paced into the next ward, and an excited
Sister came fluttering in. “Did you see the
Queen, boys?” she asked. “Did you see the
Queen?” “Wot queen?” demanded Lance-
corporal W T addy. “The Queen, our Queen,
the Queen of England!” responded Sister;
“she’s wearing a grey costume and she’s
just gone out of the ward.” “Blime!” ejacu-
lated the hard case of the establishment, “it
must ha’ been the ole girl with the ’iccups!”
# * * *
“A.11.C.”: One daily reported that at Sas-
safras (Vic.) the Prince had ridden with
one “Miss Jones, of Strachan,” and all the
Melbourne gossips started clacking. I hap-
pened to be staying at Sassafras, and next
morning, going for the mail, overtook and
chummed up with a little bush lassie of 11,
who, with her small brother, was also going
to the post office. I found that the mysteri-
ous “Miss Jones, of Strachan,” was the
little maid at my side, who, with her brother,
mounted on their ponies, pushed a way
up to the spot Where Hughes boiled the billy.
Billy pulled her up (her name is really Joan
Strachan) and warned her not to “startle
the Prince’s horse.” H.R.H. asked the
kiddie what the Priminster had been saying
to her. Joan told him. The Prince laughed
and said, “Never you mind —he’s nervous.”
Then he asked the little maid to have a cup
of tea, to which she blushingly replied that
she did not drink tea. “What do you drink?”
asked the royal host. “Water,” said Joan.
“Well, then,” said Teddy, “do come and
have some milk and water.”
The Prince had to be rescued from the
crowd at Centennial Park (Sydney) parade
of returned soldiers last week. His saviour
was Constable Walsh, formerly a major in
the A.I.F. At Cardiff (Wales) they had
an ex-colonel acting as an ordinary lumberer
of drunks for some weeks. Then the Govern-
ment stepped in and rectified what was felt
to be a scandal. There is nothing dishonor-
able in being a constable —on the contrary—
but it hardly seems the right post-war place
for one with the capacity to rise from the
bottom (as Walsh did) to within two or
three rungs of the top of the huge military
ladder. Such a situation, rightly viewed,
really casts more serious reflections on the
Army and the Army brain than do the red-
nosed comedians who are periodically at-
tacked for “bringing his Majesty’s forces
into contempt” by wearing uniforms on the
stage.
* * * *
“D.” : There is something to be said for the
thoroughly dishonest solicitor. Just as
soldiers are liable to get cold feet, so soli-
citors are liable to pilfer. An attorney who
has never been indicted or even
arrested may be compared to a
home-service swashbuckler who
has not known the imminent
concussion of a 5.9. His nerve
is good: he has in him the mak-
ings of a financial V.C. But
once let him hear the' door of a
cell bang on him and he be-
comes a changed man. The
idea of going “up the line” hor-
rifies him: he begins to duck;
he becomes a dugout king. To
abandon imagery the illiterate
widow’s mite loses its attrac-
tion. The trust account is not
squandered upon wine and
women. The will and the op-
portunity are there, but —he
remembers and puts temptation
behind him. For years I have
been employing a solicitor who
only escaped penal servitude by
a miracle. He has acted since
that experience with the utmost
honesty. And another priceless
attribute is the fact that he never bores me
with cant about “the honor of the noble
profession to which I have the privilege of
belonging.” He knows I know.
•» * * *
“Country Ped”: J. P. Refshauge, head-
master of Ballarat Agricultural High School,
has proposed to his school council that an
effort be made to secure the extension of the
Melbourne University to Ballarat. The
Melbourne Uni. is greatly overcrowded, and
additional buildings are now being erected.
But these additions will only relieve the
present strain; they will not provide for the
future. So there is a good chance for the
Government to do some decentralising. Why
should all the ’Varsity colleges be in the
capital? Or why should that be the only
place in the State in which University lec-
tures are given? Ballarat can find room
for 400 or 500 students. The Geelong
Technical Institute is willing to tutor others.
Then there is the Bendigo School of Mines.
Each of these cities should long ago have had
a University college affiliated with Mel-
bourne, just as in Maoriland there are Uni-
versity colleges at Otago, Christchurch,
Dunedin, Wellington and Auckland. Of
POSITIVE PROOF OF IT.
SHEILA: “Mummy, is the Prince of Wales
an angel?”
MOTHER: “Oh, no, dear; he's just a man.”
SHEILA: “Well, mummy, daddy said there's
Prince of Wales's feathers all over
town.”
course—at first, anyway—the colleges
couldn’t carry out all the ’Varsity courses,
such as medicine, dentistry, veterinary
science and engineering: but they could
easily manage the full course in law, arts,
education and science, and at the • same
time could give lectures for the first one or
two years of the others, after which the stu-
dents would proceed to Melbourne to finish
off. To study on one’s own in the country,
without the aid of lectures, is a heartbreak-
ing task, especially when the ’Varsity
authorities charge country students the same
fees (four guineas a subject in most cases)
to enter for examination as they do atten-
dant students, whose fees cover lectures as
well as examinations.
“Fed Up”: For weeks past I’ve put up
with long discussions by my female relations
and their friends on the “darling’s” eye-
brows and hair and “ducky little mouth.”
Shouldn’t Webster (of the dictionary)
change his definition, “Prince: A title given
to the son of a sovereign,” to “Prince: A
male princess”?
* * * *
“Mirza” : When Miss Toorak decreed that
the shoulder wasn’t the most suitable place
for a lady’s vaccination marks, Flossie
agreed, and demanded a change of address
for the decorations. Now she goes one better
and wants to know why salvarsan injections
can’t also be done on the leg. Evidently
Billo is “taking a tumble” to the signifi-
cance of the three or four white scars just
above the fold of her elbow, so she thinks
it wiser to sacrifice the fatted calf than to
lose the prodigal son.
* * * *
“0.K.”: A German delegate at the Sea-
men’s Conference in Genoa was authorised
by the German Government, it was said, to
make a statement deploring that there were
so many victims in “the submarine cam-
paign.” Whereat Havelock Wilson “expressed
satisfaction with the German recognition of
wrongs.” Let us face the facts. The whole Hun
nation gloated over the drowning of civilians
on the Lusitania. Anniversaries of the crime
were public holidays. School children were
hung with medals commemorating the easy
achievement. Pictures of bloodthirsty
submarine successes, genuine and faked, were
shown at the movies throughout Germany
and exported to friendly neutrals. The house
of every truculent Hun in Australia was
en fete the night of the Saturday when news
of the Lusitania outrage came to hand. A
measly little Hun brandished the Monday
morning paper on a Melbourne railway plat-
form, and screamed to his Scandinavian
mate: “Vot you tank! Two tousand of
dem at one go!” Happy Hun! One needs
have a very unretentive memory to accept
any present German Government assurance
of regret for the vast number of submarine
victims. Why, the hope of all Germany
was that the victims would be too numerous
for the Allies to continue the war. All
guff is annoying, but hypocritical guff of
mock contrition is worse than annoying. It
is insulting to the intelligence.
“Ex-Dig”: A homekeeping medico stated
recently that cholera was prevented during
the war by the universal use of abdominal
belts. Preposterous! Certainly belts were
issued, but as a rule they were thrown
away, being so
constructed as to
be a home from
home for the loath-
some insects with
which everybody
in the line was in-
fested or likely to
become infested;
also they made ef-
fective scratching
difficult. Only a
small percentage of
the men in the
A.I.F. obeyed the
injunction to wear
the articles; but
all respected the
regulations as to
doubtful or sus-
picious water sup-
plies. Whenever
men reported sick
with dysentery or
kindred troubles —
in fact, with almost
any kind of trouble
—they were asked
about the water
they had been
drinking; and when
the well, spring or
pond was discovered it was either chlor-
inated or declared out of bounds. That did
more to save the Diggers from infection
than all the abdominal belts in France.
* * ♦ *
“Hamer”: Accounts of divorce proceed-
ings are splashed with the “last words” of
levanting husbands, and some of them are
curious. “Well, tool-er-oo —for ever!”....
“May see you again in 12 years”.... “I’m
going; do your best”.... “Well, you’ll pay
the rent in future”.... “I’ll meet you in a
better land —if you get there.” These are
some farewell utterances of the fugitive, as
recorded by ladies with moist complexions and
agitated pocket-handkerchiefs. But better
finishes were made by gentlemen who con-
cluded with “From this on consider your-
self a widow,” and “You’ll see me again
the second time you reach 27.” Now that
the divorce habit is growing, some journal
which goes in for competitions might run
one aimed at evolving really first-class fare-
well lines for the use of husbands who need
them.
* * * *
“Centurion”: Booking over the coats of
arms of the various States as shown in the
Prince decorations, one is struck by the
A LONG, LONG JOURNEY.
“Dear, you must spare me a fiver. I’m sure
you can’t complain. I make every penny
go as far as possible.”
“Yes, so far that it never returns.”
appropriateness and originality of S. Aus-
tralia’s magpie “displayed,” as the heralds
say, in the centre of the shield. Such an
emblem would be more “native” to Aus-
tralia than the rising sun, plagiarised from
Mexico and Japan. In his courage, initia-
tive, enterprise and unconquerable optimism,
the mag. is typical of all that is best in our
national character, while his sense of humor,
adaptability to circumstances, insouciant im-
pudence, and, above all, his miraculous flow
of language, mark him as a collar badge that
the A.I.F. of the future may be proud to
wear.

SEA VANITIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I’ll love to be a housemaid on a battleship!”—
Exclamation uj flapper on seeing the Prince board-
ing the Renown.
Nursery-Commander Mary Ann Nelson leads her
unit aboard singing:
The proud old British Navy has lots of fuss and
frill,
But not one female slavey to help it at its drill;
No petticoats or laces sustain the watch on deck;
No damsels with their graces preserve the fleets from
wreck.
By reel’ and shoal uncharted the sea’s own sirens
wait
For sailors broken-hearted. Each seeks a human
mate;
Their green eyes almost blister the passing cruiser’s
sides,
And yet the Navy’s sister must stay ashore all tides!
(Iloyal Naval Nursemaids weep into their muslin
aprons. )
Though admirals may languish for smiles with morn-
ing tea,
And captains dream in anguish of housemaids on the
knee,
These comforts are denied them so long as they’re
afloat;
No Mary Ann’s beside them to help them steer the
boat.
(Royal Naval Nursemaids waltz around wheel.)
The black-edged, roaring “busters” that leap at every
ship
Don’t meet her feather-dusters or spray her earmined
lip ;
And where her naval laces might hang aloft to dry,
A lot of wind-browned faces turn idly to the sky.
With plotted interlockings our ships patrol the seas,
But never may silk stockings flap proudly in the
breeze.
Ah, dull the Navy’s mission our lives and land to
save
Till ag6d men a-fishin’ haul corsets from each wave!
Complaining chorus by male members of ship’s
company:
Around the world and back again
We go and never stop;
You cannot track us sailormen
By hairpins that we drop.
Yet Britons all must scream and bawl
This patriotic guff:
“Our Jack makes all his foemen crawl
With his old powder puff!”
(Appropriate dance by all hands, after which
ices and afternoomtea are served by Royal Naval
Nursemaids.)

“Yarriambiak”: A Goulburn Valley
(Vic.) postmistress was unacquainted with
the War Gratuity, and the application forms
did not turn up to time. A girl who had
had four brothers at the Front went to col-
lect their application forms. “But surely
you don’t want four?” queried the post-
mistress, who appeared to be startled. “Oh,
yes, I do,” replied the girl, and four papers
were issued. When the Diggers got them
there was a joyous uproar. They were
maternity-bonus forms.

“Dido”: On the Ormonde when she sailed
out from Melbourne the other day were close
upon 200 war brides who had. failed to locate
their Australian husbands. After spending
a year chasing after Bill Tyson, of Thistle
Run, the Domain (N.S.W.), or Jim Chirn-
side, of the Bathurst Burr Cultivation Area,
Werribee (Vic.), the girls have given up in
despair, and gone back to the Old Dart in
a state of shocking matrimonial incertitude,
some of them with bundles of baby, one un-
fortunate with twins. The latter’s depar-

ture is a matter of the greatest possible
satisfaction to the members of one rich
family in Melbourne, whose youngest son
she claimed with such ferocity and such in-
sistence that at one time she had the sym-
pathy of half the suburb, public opinion
affecting to trace the lineaments of the
young man in the features of the babies. Only
complete evidence that the youth was fight-
ing in Prance and getting wounds at the
precise time when the lady claimed that he
was in London marrying her according to
the methods of the Presbyterian Church
satisfied the unfortunate that she had not
accurately placed the father of her twins.

broken-hearted damsel who, when sym-
pathised with, and asked had she been de-
ceived by an Australian husband, replied in
tremulous tones: “Yes, by both of the

“Mountwelling”: The Princelet’s visit
seems likely to utterly smash friendships
that have survived a lifetime of merely
local friction. In every city in the Aus-
tralian circuit there have been disagreements
between members of reception committees,
and in Hobart the usually staid and matter-
of-fact old codgers of the Marine Board
almost came to blows over the choosing of
the spot at which the Prince should climb
ashore. One of the wardens. Captain Jaeky
Evans, who is also Speaker of the Assembly,
generated such a head of steam that he
erupted through the door into the street, and
marched away uttering emphatic remarks to
the effect that he was “done with the whole

“My husband, loves severely simple dresses!”
“Mine doesn’t —the bills for them are always
so simply severe.”
dashed affair.” Nobody doubts that the
energetic little mariner had cause for indig-
nation, but his friends are full of concern
lest the outburst should be misconstrued in
higlj places and lead to a further delay in
the arrival of a knighthood. .Jacky has been
a C.M.G. for quite a long while.
“Flinders”: Justice Burnside, of West-
ralia, has taken a_new judicial view of it.
And whether the final conclusion was wise
or not, it is a sane view. Petitioner was
19 and the lady younger still. Three days
after the marriage he went to a job at
Wyndliam. in the North, attracted by high
wages, and the flapper-bride became a Mary
Ann in Suburbia. There Lothario, in the
shape of the grocer’s boy, offered consola-
tion, and the backdoor romance developed
in the usual way. The facts were not dis-
puted ; but ’s Honor, instead of pouncing
upon the maiden, refused to untie the knot
and upbraided the petitioner. What did he
mean, asked his Honor, by deserting the
child V Had he no idea of the temptation
he was throwing her into—temptation
against which many grown women did not
stand? But it was a good thing the war
was over before ’s Honor referred to sol-
diers’ wives who had “found other husbands
before the troopships had disappeared over
the horizon.” Under the War Precautions
Act his Honor would certainly have been
up for “making statements prejudicial to
recruiting.”
*'* * *
, “Hamer”: In some respects the cheap
hops of to-day are different from the
“Gents-a-shilling-Ladies-free” revels of the
previous madness. Nowhere in Sj’dney
nowadays can you hear a master of cere-
monies with oiled hair and a greasy colored
neckcloth calling upon the bucks to “Grab yer
muttons” or “Collar yer muslin for the next
dawiice!” Vanished also is the habit of
dancing on the piano or clearing a space
behind it for one gent to have it out with
another for collarin’ his tart. Nowadays, it
is not bad form to rag with another bloke’s
mutton; in fact, muttons and muslins have,
colloquially-speaking, ceased to exist, and
it is quite de rigger for a young lady (they are
all yqung ladies) to darnce with somebody
besides the young gentleman what brings her
without the incident being provocative of fistic
violence. In fact, a modern cheap dance-room
is a model of decorum compared with the
places that usually finished the night’s en-
tertainment with a free fight in which empty
beer-bottles were the favorite weapons. But
I’m not sure that it’s a change for the better.
Probably Bilio doesn’t throw bottles now
because his views about Liz are less rigid
than they used to be.
* * * *
“Jonah”: The father in charge of the
Bathurst Island Mission has a forthright
way of marrying off the young half-caste
girls under his care. As soon as they arrive
at a marriageable age, he proceeds to Darwin
and makes a tour of the colored camps, in-
quiring if any gentlemen require wives. Ap-
proved applicants go back with him. As
soon as the boat arrives the bell is rung, the
girls line up, selections are made, and the
marriages performed, the bridal feast being
provided by the Mission. The bridal couples
later return to Darwin, where each bride-
groom settles down to his usual occupation
of sanitary worker or fisherman. All very
casual, but apparently happy enough.
The Criminal Court in Adelaide for nearly
a fortnight has had a theatre-queue outside it,
with the better informed and more adven-
turous butting past scandalised officials on
back staircases. The wife of Alec Lee and
three small children certainly died of strych-
nine ; the question was whether she admin-
istered it or he did. With her last breath,
he said, she admitted having taken it,' but
begged that her mother
should not know —which
was why he at first
called it accidental.
Three things put the rope
about his neck. A girl
told how he had asked
her to marry him if his
wife died, “which might
not be long” ; he had pro-
cured poison, “for a dog,”
from a distance; and one
child died so long after
the mother that the
swift poison could scar-
cely i'n that instance
have been administered
by her. Also two elder
children, Lee’s admitted
favorites, were not poi-
soned at all. Povey, a
rising young counsel, did
all that could be done
for the defence; but
Shierlaw, for the Crown,
was able to bring in a
damning weight of cir-
cumstantial evidence.
The jury took under two
hours to say guilty, and Judge Poole, whose
first murder trial it was, entirely concurred.
But l°e still shouts his innocence.
* * * *
“Spare Corp” : The habit of picking up
pets -was common to all the A.I.F. forma-
tions, and our battalion’s was a kid. It was
a playful creature, and in time it learned that
the surest way to win applause was to butt
some unconscious visitor in the seat of his
trousers. One day the staff was inspecting
the cookers, and one of them stooped to have
a closer look at the stew- and tea-dixies. In
doing so he presented an easy target to an
infant that had been trained with an eye to
such things. The language of that officer, as
lie wiped stew and tea from his damaged
person, was ably supported by the remarks
of other officers who had been generously
splashed. The sinner didn’t live to be a
goat. He wasn’t discriminating enough.
* * • *
“Doberitz Camp”: “Dr. Nil's” preamble
about fearless horsemen (B. 3/6/’2O). does
not convince me. I was rounded up on the
Marne in September, 1914, along with Scores
of other cavalrymen, by an inferior number
of Prussian and Saxon Uhlans, who com-
pletely outfought, outrode and outmanoeuvred
us. During my 4-f years in Germany after-
wards I had opportunity enough to watch
their cavalry and other mounted men, and
found them as good, on the whole, as any
other nation’s. And I’ve seen a few. I was
in Tripoli during the Turco-Italian war, and
saw the Italian cavalry at work there; and
the fact that “Dr. Nil” places the Italians
first on the cavalry list convinces me that
he doesn’t know much about either cavalry
or war.
* * * *
“Jonah”: The Commission on the North-
ern Territory dug up the fact that the only
thing produced at the Batchelor Demonstra-
tion Farm, after an expenditure of £l7OO,
was a pumpkin. But the witness omitted
to mention that a photographer had been
sent out from Darwin to make a picture
of it. On arrival he found that the
precious vegetable had been pinched. A
hue and cry was raised, and it was found
boiling in a kercsene-tin at an adjacent con-
tractor’s camp. The contractor eventually
squared matters by presenting somebody
with a box to pack his curios in. I know,
as I made the box and ate my share of the
pumpkin.
WITH INTEREST.
PIERRE: “I’m going to steal a kiss, Fleurette.”
FLEURETTE : “I thought ou knew it is
wicked to steal—perhaps I could lend
you a few.”
As told by the lady herself: —
As l take an interest in the poor things, I went
to a dance at one of the big Vic. mental hospitals.
A very gentlemanly man, who, I was told, was a
patient, asked me politely to waltz with him, and
I did. He was very nice, and I told the superin-
tendent afterwards that I could not understand why
he was there. The doctor suggested that I should
try another dance, and tap him on religion.
Prompted by the doc. my friend invited me to have
another whirl. Then I applied the test. He suavely
told me that one religion was as good as another,
and added, more positively and oracularly, “pro-
vided that one is sincere and practises it.” “But
what authority have you for saying that?” I asked,
still searching. “Because,” he replied, “I’m God.”
Wishing to say something civil before I retreated I
smirked my best and remarked: “I hope you’ll
remember me on the Day of Judgment.” He rose
and replied in indignant tones: “Madam, I never
talk shop at a ball.”

“124” : These actresses really ought to be
more careful; they have seriously upset
some Victorian public-schools men. At the
annual re-union of the Old Geelong Colle-
gians a rep., in reply to a toast, dwelt on
the reprehensible way in which school
colors—public-school colors, no less—were
being prostituted to make a Boat Race
Night holiday. With the blush of shame
struggling for supremacy with the flush of
indignation he told how actresses had
appeared bedecked with the colors of the
schools, and how one hussy in making the
final kick of her exit had disclosed—shades
of Wesley and of Knox ! —a garter of the
thus-dishonored bi-color! Guests jambed
tongues in cheek and applauded vocifer-
ously. Since then several other public-
schools men have expressed disgust, too—
that the item was not encored.
“Lud” : Commonsense stares at the farci-
cal restriction of tailors’ profits proposed by
the Vic. Commission, and especially at the
reason given-—“the greatly increased prices
of materials, amounting to three or four or
five times pre-war prices.” The Government
pays a number of persons to inquire into
the why and wherefore of profiteering, and
these hired inquirers have the audacity to
accept the preposterous prices of material
as burdens which the public must neces-
sarily bear. Why have materials manu-
factured in Victoria from local wool, by
machinery which was working before the
war, become three, four or five times dearer
than they were before the war? Has the
Commission been drawing fees all this time
in order to arrive nt the conclusion that the
prices charged for woollen material are fairf
DECORATIONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The evergreens have faded in the street,
The flags begin to look the worse, for wear,
The colored rags and tinsel feel the feet
Of the black spider weaving everywhere
H.is sombre decorations grey and high
To snare the dusty moth and heedless fly.
Here Caesar went and Rome applauded loud;
Here Solomon drove by on gilded wheels;
Here Pharaoh moved t)ie wonder of the crowd;
i Here Xerxes passed with armies at his heels!
The spider saw the pageantry of man—
Woolbrokers built an arch for Genghis Khan !
Purple is strangely cheap, though bread be dear;
And at the twinkle of the colored lights
Age runs with age, gaped mouth and open ear,
To hear the noises and to see the sights
Till ruined Rome be heaped on Babylon,
While time and the black spider labor on.
But there are decorations that remain
Whether a purple Cesar stand or fall:
The bright leaves gilded in a sunset rain,
The red rose tossing bloom against the wall,
The green, far fields, the blue hills lifted high,
Wheat rippling into bread beneath the sky.
Blow, blow, brave music of the sunlit breeze!
Let the great garlands of the forest wave;
For splendid steps' of destiny are these,
Walking the world with zeal the world to save.
They bear the master of two hands that toil
To win to law a wild and lawless soil.
The crowds below the tinsel pass away,
The shoutings sink to silence in an hour;
Alone the spider spins her threads of grey,
And smiles at fame and knows the truth of powei.
But after Rome and after Babylon
A long applause goes ringing, ringing on.
It is the cry of children laughing loud
Where at mid-noon the happy smokes are curled
Above the little roofs of homes that crowd
The great green decorations of the world.
O Prince of brown strong hands, the greater Rome
Shrills its applause about the doors of home!
I know not where the dreams of men shall stray
tn the new ages dim with grander light;
But this is truth sufficient for the day,
Sufficient for the morrow and the night:
Time laughs with him who carves from out the wild
A true home decorated with a child.

“Horse”: Talking about weird tastes of
memento gatherers, there’s an old sport in Queens-
land who showed me a glass case containing different
jars labelled “Carbine,” “Desert Gold,” “Mountain
King,” “Trafalgar,” “Golden Sunset,” etc. He
handed me the jar labelled “Carbine.” On opening
it I was astonished to find nothing but horse-
manure. The old bloke waxed enthusiastic and said:
“That’s not ’arf bad, is it ? It’s Carbine’s, all
right. ’Ad it sent up from Melbourne. Look at
that er Desert Gold’s —ain’t it dandy? ’Ad it sent
up from Noo South. That there of Golden Sunset’s
is the latest. Got it after he won the big race larst
week. Not as good as Carbine’s, though.” As I
left I told him he only wanted a sample of a
rocking-horse’s to complete the set.

“J.G.”: “L. and Tommy” (B. 27/5/’2O)
wants to know if there is any limit to the life of
strychnine. I dunno. But I do know this. Years
back the Vic Government vermin-destruction officials
laid strychnine baits (apple) for rabbits in the
Kamarooka forest, 30 miles or so north of Bendigo.
A good many rodents sampled the doped fruit and
threw in their towel. Then, years afterwards, a
local cocky’s pigs broke into the forest, came
across these long-defunct bunnies, and chewed up
the rotting bones. In a few hours the cocky had
two or three hundredweight of pork on his hands.

“Paul C”: “Caloola” (B. 27/5/’2O)
wants to know a sure-cure for bots in horses. Make
the nag fast for 12 hours. Keep feed of all kinds
away from him. Then give him a quart or more of
treacle diluted with warm water, to make it flow
freely. Half an hour afterwards give him a
quart of sage-tea, warm. Then, in quarter of an
hour, drench him with a pint of raw linseed-oil. It
all works out this way. The bots release their
hold on the lining of the stomach to get at the
treacle. The sage-tea puckers them up, so that
they cannot catch hold again. The linseed-oil is the
undertaker’s van.

“Per Ardua” : I taught over 15 abos. in a
State school near Dubbo (N.S.W.) 20 years ago. It
was a mixed school with a sprinkling of all nations.
I took a great interest in the abos. and found that,
generally, they could be taught to read and write,
but arithmetic beat them all. Jinnie Peeler was
learning the alphabet (it was the custom then), and
after five years she knew as much as when she began.
But her brother Jack was bright and fairly intelli-
gent, and he wrote a good hand and could spell
well, wrote an intelligent letter and spoke good
English. I saw him five years ago, and found he
had quite drifted back. He and his gin were at
home in their dirty little gunyah, and two young
Peelers were playing with twice as many dirty little
puppies. I questioned him about school matters to
see if any had stuck, and asked him if he ever now
read or wrote. “No fear, Schoolmaster; it make my
damn head ache too much, mine tinkit.”

“Bouragi” : Gamada, the tipple of the
Western Papuan, of which “Baba” writes (B.
10/6/’2O), is the same snake-juice as the more
famous kava, and is made in the same fashion —
from the chewed fibred of Piper methysticwm. But
there is nd ceremonial about the consumption of
gamada as there is with the kava-drinking of Fiji
and Samoa, where the stuff is a chief’s liquor and
not for the lowah ordahs. With the Western
Papuan gamada, like the Australian’s beer, is just
stuff good to eat, and blow the ceremony! It
■affects the nerve-centres governing the legs. One
is quite sensible but absolutely unable to walk
straight. Incidentally a skinful of it makes you
smell like a b6ehe-de-mer cutter. East of the Gulf
of Papua gamada is unknown among the tribes.
The leaf of the piper, etd.p is. however, universally
chewed with lime and the areca nut, the compound
making what we call, after the Malays, betel.
“Tix”: “Coolabah” (B. 27/5/’2O) asFs
how to cure a 15-year-old pony mare that has been
rendered useless by founder for 15 months and
has been in hospital fob the last six. Get a fire-
arm, a live cartridge to fit it, load, stand about 6ft.
from the mare’s head, point the gun at a spot an
inch above the curl in the mare’s forehead, hold
the weapon steady, and pull the trigger. The mare
will be much better off, and so will you, because
chaff is too dear and is wanted for stock that are of
some value. P.S.—Don’t forget to cock the gun.
* * * *
“Pittsworth” : “John Quill” (B. 27/5/’2O)
asked about Murray cod he found in a Cudgegong
hole. The fish had eaten all the food contained in
the hole, and were suffering from the effects of
starvation when “J.Q.” commenced to angle. Fish
weakened by starvation become sick and will not
bite. In the Condamine, during the last drought,,
large fish swam in clear, drying holes; no food was
present and the fish were seen to die slowly. People
who have taken out live fish that do not bite tell
me that violent attacks of vomiting followed the
eating of them. The larger fish, by the way, do
not seem to stand famine as well as the smaller fry.
* * * *
“Samaritan”: “Coolabah.” (B. 27/5/’2O)
wants to cure a foundered prad. Old Bios belonged
to a neighbor of mine who owned an orchard, mostly
apples. She was badly foundered when he bought
her, and as he had little or no grass-land attached to
his orchard, Bios was fed largely on apples—wind-
falls and inferior sorts. She improved rapidly, and
later I bought her and worked her regularly in the
plough and in a dray, and she never developed
further symptoms. If apples are not available try
eider.
“John Quill”: How long will strychnine
be effective? (B. 27/5/’2O). Just so long as it
remains strychnine; in other words, so long as the
combination of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and
oxygen is not broken up. Strychnine is a stable
compound, fairly insoluble in water, and is not

properties which help it to retain its chemical
identity and its deadly qualities so long. Every
bushman is wary of using any old jam-tin as a
drinking vessel, and cases where poisoning has re-
sulted from ancient baits are quite common in the
bush, even sheep and horses falling victims to
poison washed on to grass and leaves months after it
was laid.
* * * *
“Crescent”: Bill Hogan owned the first
motor-bike at Stockyard Creek, but the ownership
suddenly terminated when the machine disputed the
right-of-way with an ironbark. Bill told me how it
happened. “Yer see, I ran outer lubrakatin’ oil.
Arst ole Rafferty fer the lend of some, but he on’y
had gohanna oil on tap; so I charnst it. Things was
all serene till I went sailin’ a-past Perry’s, when a
pack er damn curs rushed out an’ me bike made a
mad go to scale the nearest tree. The gohanna hin-
stinkt was still in that flamin’ oil.”
* * * *
“Mirza” : We thought O’Brien took it well
when he was informed that his nephew Pat had
extinguished himself in the river. Suddenly he tore
out of the house and commenced to harness an
emaciated apparition. “Sorry I’Ve got to leave you,
boys,” he called; “but this makes me short-handed
with the milkin’, and I’ve got to sell them heifers
before the news gets round.” Dairying does make
a man a Cow.
* # * #
“Murkah”: The ass who /invented the ex-
pression “turned dog on me” ought to be prosecuted
for libel. It’s a cert, that he never owned a dog.
A man’s dog is the one thing that never turns dog
on him. Two minutes after being kicked unmerci-
fully by his drunken owner I’ve seen a dog battle in
viciously on that owner’s behalf when his bullying
brought on a drunken row. That’s the one objection
I’ve got to dogs—they don’t care who owns them.
* * * *
“Jimsey” : When a dingo litters she almost
immediately leaves her family and calls on a sister
who has a half-grown litter and arranges a swap.
She takes her pick of the half-grown pups and returns
to her family accompanied by the mother of the
half-grown lot, who in turn takes her pick of the
new arrivals. The mother of the babies is afraid
that they will stray out into the open and be
snapped up by a dingo or an eaglehawk while she
is away foraging. The elder pup has been trained
to stay in the log and is placed in charge during
the mother’s absence. This no doubt explains why
a litter of dingo pups is all shapes and sizes.
A “society” item from the Gulf, per North
Queensland Register (24/5/’2O)
Sambo, who has been tracker for the local police
for some years, has been paid off, the two months'
notice which he g’ave having expired. He and his
Jnbi a, Lizzie Lane, intend to go to the Cooktown
district, of which Sam is a native. They propose

“Jonah.”: I met him on the boat going
north —a tall, well-built half-caste abo. 1-Ie was
returning after three years’ active service to
his port of enlistment. Wiping his mouth as we
left the first-saloon dining room, he remarked: “I’ll
be damn glad to get back home again—l’m dying for
a feed of ’possum.” The last I heard of him he
was out “bush” on a fencing job having ’possum
to his heart’s content.
*•* * *
“Remlya” : Re frogs jumping into the fire.
Don’t reckon that should surprise a man about this
creature, which I have seen in the act of swallowing
one of its brethren nearly its own size. When I
disturbed his. nibs from the meal he at once dis-
gorged his partly-masticated brother and hopped off,
seemingly to find another victim in a place where he
would have peace and quiet.

“Zanthus”: They have struck a new
irrigation trouble this year at Lake Meran (Vic.).
The little Murray tortoises are coming down the
irrigation channels, and often get stuck in the out-
lets, blocking the flow of water.

THE PRINCE AND THE BIG J.P.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The State her favor to evince
Made Thomas Poll a great J.P.
“I’m more than friendly with the Prince,
We are related now,” said he.
“We’re sort of cousins to the King.
That being so, whatever fails
Of course I can’t neglect a thing
That would some satisfaction bring
To Edward who is Prince of Wales.”
So Mary, who is fifteen stone,
Went up to town without delay,
With Annie, Jane and Kate, her own
Dear daughters, and there straight away
They hired a dancing-master tall
To teach deportment and what not,
And how to curtsey and not fall,
The hesitation waltz, and all
The jazzes, and the foxy trot.
Old Tom a high belltopper bought,
And Mary silk and lace galore,
The girls a -dozen frocks, and thought
They ought to have a dozen more.
Ma did her spinal column in
Through worshipping on bended knee
A dummy with a painted grin
All in a crown of purest tin,
And trimmed with lace and filigree.
She lost two stone in trying hard,
And then she couldn’t trot a bit.
The hotel costs their pleasure marred,
But Poll he said: “We’re owin’ it
To Edward, Prince of Wales, who will
Be mighty glad, I know, to see
Tom Poll down here from Timber Hill.
For J.P. is, I tell you, still
A title of nobilerty.”
THE ARISTOCRATS.
SERGEANT CASEY : “A cell to yerself ye
want, is it? Then ye’ll hav’e to commit
somethin’ better than a plain dhrunk,
sich as a hank robbery r' a murder or
th’ loike. No fav'ritism here at all —’tis
all a matter of merit.”
They put on all their lovely clo’es
To meet Prince Edward at a ball.
The door was shut on Tommy’s nose.
He came not to the Prince at all.
“I’ll see his Highness hears!” declared
The great J.P. They laughed aloud.
With clobber torn and eye impaired,
Oh, shockingly the J.P. fared
When battling through a city crowd!
Tom wrote the Prince, got no reply,
And now he tells disloyal tales:
Try as he might he came not nigh
To his Aloofness, Prince of Wales.
He tells the Hill how enviously
The swells behaved. “It was a sin.
They’d scores of coppers set to see
The Prince was kep’ apart from me.
Gorstruth, they even fenced him in!”
VICTORIA.

Experience has taught motorists that it costs
no more to demand “Texaco” Motor Oil, but it means a lot to
be without it. The first evidence you get from using “Texaco”
Motor Oil is a new responsiveness from your car. It means
that “Texaco” is holding that necessary “seal” between
cylinder walls and piston-rings. A perfect seal means conser-
vation of power and a saving of motor spirit, two factors
which assure maximum efficiency and minimum running costs.

■ S.N.O. ’: “W.L.” (B. 27/5/’2O) mentions
that the kookaburra got his nickname from “gigas,”
the latter part of the title which science inflicts on
him. It seems unlikely. Am I using my hat as a
mouthpiece in giving the French chicasser —to laugh
—as the derivation? I put a lot of faith in French
naturalists since discovering a book of New Holland
adventures in the house of a Somme physician. The
cover depicted a hunter charged by some 20 ferocious
wombats.
* * * *
“Carbine” : For founder I’ll back the fol-
lowing remedy against the best of ’em. Take
a tablespoonful of pulverised alum, pull the mare’s
tongue out as far as it will stretch and throw the
alum down her throat. Let go her tongue, and hold
up her head until she swallows. In six hours’ time,
no matter how bad the founder, she should be fit
for moderate work.
“Bareoo”: In 1893, Bananaland’s record
year of floods and bank smashes, W. C. Green, now
oi Charleville, delivered in one camp, in one after-
noon, 39,000 six-tooth Milo wethers. The counting-
in was done by Halligan, overseer at Nindigully,
the property of the A. P. Co. Three days later J. J.
Dobbyn, now of Rockhampton (C.Q.), hopped in
with 28,000 Northampton six-tooths from off the
Bareoo, delivered within four hours one morning.
The drover astonished himself by that day correctly
counting 56,426 sheep thuswise. Counting his sheep
off-camp a mile back from the gate of delivery, he
declared his number —>28,214 —before proceeding to
deliver, thus instituting the right to “call” the
tallies (100’s). This was on account of a dispute
at the previous delivery of the Milos. Knowing
what was on, the whole of the drover’s under-
strappers—good men all —were on the scene for the
result, including a contingent from the adjacent
Old Nindigully pub. The sheep were tallied off in
4000 lots, to he put into different paddocks, and
incidentally one of the paddocks into which the
last lot went was totally submerged in four feet
of vvater by daylight next morning, a huge flood
rushing down the river during the night. When
the last sheep hopped through the counting-gate the

CHAPPIE I: “The bounder has awfully nar-
row views. I pointed out that the stu-
pendous national debt will nevah he
paid while he worries me for a trivial
fiver owing only five years.”
CHAPPIE II : “As a mattah of fact, old thing,
you don’t owe him a fivah. His bally
fivah is worth only two quid to-day.”
number was 28,212. fhe two cooks belonging to
the two camps which comprised the plant chipped
in that they had each caught a “killer” after the
morning count. Three different counters had gone
to pieces by the time the boss had reached the first
7000. Then a nephew of the late historic sport,
C. B. Fisher, took a hand, finishing the job ’
counting the last 21,000 sheep for sheep with the
drover. In those parts this performance of Dob-
byn’s is still spoken of with the local substitute
for bated breath.
lix : lo squash the argument, allow me
to introduce Tom Jones and his six feet of sinewy
Australian as the greatest rough-rider Australia has
produced. This happened at Cobham Lake Hotel
nor’-west corner of N. S. Wales, where Wonnaminta
Joe still hangs out the sign. The stockmen and
others had come many miles to this oasis for Christ-
mas races and Consequences. Tom arrived on his
favorite hack, a renowned buck-jumper. The races
ended, those that wanted (and were able) to go
prepared for home. As Tom led his colt out a joker
with a false sense of' humor sooled on his cattle-dog.
Maddened by the unusual treatment, the colt com-
menced to cut capers that would have made a stunt-
HOW IT IS DONE.
“Pure milk—how interesting! The two
little handles at the hack, I suppose, are
the ones that you pull for cream.”
ing aeroplane look like a fixture. Whilst the colt
looped the loop, side-rolled, etc., Tom swung into the
saddle (polev), leaned down, grabbed the dog by
the scruff, then used him as a flail to belabor the
colt on either side, and finally, with unerring aim
and enormous force, hurled Bluey at the joker,
sprawling him amongst the empties. After which
Tom, waving farewell, cantered across the lake to
Oobham station, where he was employed for years.
* . * * *
“Scottie the Rake”: In the Fish Creek
ranges (N.Q.) are many little valleys, deep and
heavily timbered. These “pockets” are di'y, except
in the wet season, and water is to be had only by sink-
ing; yet they teem with birds and other small game.
This had me thinking hard until one day in a big
twisted box-root I found a knot-hole, about the size
of a tea-cup, filled with water. The root was
polished and the ground bared for a yard around
by the feet of generations of tiny hush-folk. I
emptied the little reservbir and it filled again within
an hour. The water was cold, crystal-clear and as
bitter as gall. I found several after that, all in
box-roots. On cutting one out I found that the
water came up the root and not down from the tree.
The root was quite solid, and the holes, though
always full, were never overflowing.
* * * *
“Bat”: He hadn’t a penny., but with the
courage born of a large-sized thirst he walked
into the bar. The topic was flies and how to kill
them—the bar was full of m He laid down his
swag and butted in. He explained that he had
rid whole towns of the pest. In fact, that was
what he was travelling for. Bung gave him a
beer, and he enlarged on his subject. We shouted
round and he had many drinks. We got impatient
at last and wanted to see the flies meet their doom.
He excused himself for a minute, and went out
into the yard. A moment later we saw him just
outside with an axe in his hands, “Come on,” he
shouted, “send your flies out now.”
“V.D.” : I have two large wild-pig hides
that I want to turn into saddles. Can you let me
know how to set about the tanning ?
Nalia Dooh”: I’ve struck some queer
noms de track, and there are one or two good ones
out here on the Georgina, among them the Busted
Oven, Cuckoo Jack, Blue Bob, the Tropical Frog,
the White Swan and Whirling Spray. The last-
named at one time carried a gramophone to amuse
the colored belles. Then there is Sovereign Smith,
who goes to sleep for over 48 hours at a stretch.
There is Clever Mary, too, but he’s a station-hand,
whereas the others (or most of them) are cooks;
and not one man in 20 would know them under
their baptismal names.
Bad Australian”: There is nothing ex-
ceptional about that Oodnadatta goat fostering a
piccaninny (B. 3/6/’2O). A big percentage of Indian
and half-breed kids throughout S. America draw
theii sustenance direct from Nanny. It is interest-
ing to see the old folk seated on bullock or horse-
skull settees around the family hearth, imbibing
Verba mate or cana, while the younger fry hang like
so many leeches to their respective foster-mothers.
“Dolphin”: Pearling in the South Seas
is well over a century old. In a petition written
in 1812 William Campbell, master of the brig
James Hay, claims that some years before he had
discovered the “Pamotooes” (? Paumoto) Islands,
about 600 miles to the north-east of Tahiti, and
in them a pearl fishery which promised to be of
much value to the trade of Sydney. Early in 1813
two pearling vessels from Sydney, the brig Daphne
and the Queen Charlotte,
were seized by the natives,
chiefly Raiateans, em-
ployed as divers. In the
case of the Daphne the
divers, led by one Amill,
a Lascar, killed the cap-
tain, Michael Podger, and
two seamen, and put eight
Europeans ashore on the
desolate island of Arava
without even a fish-hook to
help them to get tucker
with. Then they com-
pelled the six other Euro-
peans belonging to the
crew to take the vessel to
Tahiti. There Theodore
Walker, master of the
Sydney brig Endeavor, re-
captured her and hanged
Amill from the yard-arm.
But the late Podger seems
to have been an utter
scoundrel. At an island
called Remat ena 18
natives came off with
three small canoes loaded
with bananas and yams
which Fodger bought for
a few bits of hoop-iron
and some pearl-shells.
While the natives were on board their canoes were
swamped, but though the Daphne was seven miles
off shore with a gale blowing Fodger drove the
nigs, overboard at the rope’s end and 14 were
drowned.

“Dolphin”: True cannibalism, as distinct
from the occasional eating of human flesh under the
pressure of hunger, is by no means a
characteristic of the lowest races of man-
kind. The palasolithic savages who have
survived down to modern times in out-of-
the-way corners, such as the Tasmanian
abos., the Andaman Islanders, the Bush-
men of South Africa and the Fuegians,
were not cannibals. It is alleged that
the Fuegians ate their old women, but
that was only in times of great scarcity.
The evidence as to the existence of can-
nibalism in Australia is very contradic-
tory. If the practice ever really pre-
vailed it was in the North. But the true
cannibal races, including such people as
the Fans and other negro races in Africa,
the Battaks of Sumatra (who had
evolved an alphabet and system of writing
of their own), the Papuans, Melanesians,
many Polynesians (including the Maoris),
the Aztecs and the Caribs (from whose
name the very word cannibal is supposed
to be .derived), were far ahead even of
the most advanced Australian tribes. It
is curious that cannibal practices seem to
have put a sort of ring round the globe
by way of Central Africa, the East Indies,
Melanesia and Polynesia and so to Mexico,
the West Indies and the north-east corner
of South America. Maoriland is off the
main track, which keeps to the tropics,
though it bends now north and now south
of the Equator; but, then, the Maori
migration seems to have been a sporadic
and more or less accidental movement of
quite recent date. The Moriori, who originally in-
habited ALL., were probably not cannibals.
* * * *
“Pim”: At Bellingen (N.S.W. North
Coast) I lately secured a fine specimen of the wonder-
ful Angler fish. Many people won’t believe that
this fellow uses a rod, line and bait to catch liis
prey. I have, however, seen and handled several
of them. This last one I found in a hollow of a
sunken rock while 1 was fishing - with a spear. As
I knew that the species is very slothful and quiet,
I easily secured it with my hands. The fish was
sJin. long, and had a girth of 6iin. The head is
nowise prepossessing in appearance, being deeply
grooved, and mounted with short protuberances of
hard skin, closely resembling seaweed. This, to-
gether with the fish’s color, is a protection as well
as a disguise. In the top of the head, and extend-
ing to his back, is a cavity for the purpose of
packing away his rod and bait; and they fit so
exactly into this cavity that they may easily pass
unnoticed. The butt of the rod roots firmly to the
forehead of the fish, and when extended for action
hangs in a slight and graceful curve over the fish’s
mouth; the bait, suspended from the small
end of the rod, hangs right before the open mouth
of the fish. The rod in an ordinary-sized specimen
is about lin. long, and extends into a line about
fin. long. The bait varies in color,, but is usually
pale yellow, is about the size of a No. 1 grain of
shot, and spherical in shape. The unwieldy body,
compared with the small and rather puny fins,
shows that the fish is not a fast swimmer, and
trusts to its protective resemblance to its surround-
ings rather than to speed for defence. The huge
proportions of the abdomen, on which it rests,
suggest that its method of catching its prey is very
successful. Generally speaking, the fish is of a
dusky brown or dark green color, according to the
nature of its home surroundings. The unwary fry,
being inquisitive enough to examine the bait, fall an
easy prey to this most peculiar little cannibal.
Jobbei . X don t know About a crow
being able to fly away with an egg in iiis beak, but
1 do know that he can get away with a golf-ball.
On the Cootamundra course last Easter his nibs
imshied with about two quids’ worth of the elusive
sphere. He would plant in the trees off the fairway
and on several occasions, before a player could get
to the ball he had driven, the imp of Hades was
down on it and away at the double. What he did
with the ball we couldn’t find out. It may be good
sport for the crow, but with balls at three and four
bob each there’s not much in it for the players.

Barcoo ’: Old Waddy Mundowie was
a noted character 20 years ago about the head of
Cooper s Creek. Though he was a fair stockman
he had only two stumps for legs, and hobbled
hither and thither with the aid of two sticks
(waddies). Binghi in the early ’seventies was a
treacherous neighbor on the Cooper, and the pioneer
squatter of Welford Downs station (the station took
its name from its owner) was speared to death
wlnie working at a saw-pit on his lonesome. The
black police in those days were stationed in charge
of a white inspector right on the outside rim of
Civilisation, and were soon on the scene. Waddy
happened to be the first man apprehended. After
the usual drive and clean-up had taken place he
pointed out the men who did the actual killing.
He was allowed to go free; but, hearing that he
was marked” by the tribe, he endeavored to break
away on to the Warrego, 180 miles east. Some of
the head men of his tribe came up with him before
A SUPPLANTER.

“Gorn, is ’e? Well, too the "ell is this

he had got half-way—near where Adavale now stands.
The penalty was that his feet should be burned off.
The crack of a nulla-nulla over the head knocked
him senseless. Then his extremities were stuffed
into the glowing embers of a gidya camp-fire. He
recovered, and for years was the greatest wag in
the camps of the' Cooper.

AVe said it aloud in the hot sky’s ear,
Our throats for the purpose straining;

Of the house when it started raining.
Tes, as straight as a wall the great rain dropped
■ In sixteen different places ;
Then the wind said “Woof!” and the downpour

And the dust was blown in our faces.

And the cows came home before us;
We let them in on a dry rose bed
And they ate the stumps in chorus.

on Personally we are glad it is. Why ? Well, its this
way— Recommendation, Advertising, Salesmanship, &c., tec.,
all help catch sales, but when the retort—the road test
gets to work, it’s then that Dunlop quality and value starts
to make life friends. The first set gives fine alkround
results. The second lot do likewise—each cover getting
into old age and a big mileage. The same quality and the
same reliable service continues. This goes on year after
year—and what’s the result-you can’t shift any motors, off

debts and other obligations to friends
promptly, though such creditors may be well
able to afford the loss of the money; but a
gentleman may swindle his tradespeople.
Rawdon Crawley is a type that is familiar
to every Trade Protection Society in the
Empire. Also a gentleman may commit
adultery, but he must not talk about it; and
it landed in litigation as a result he must
deny it on oath. Hence the phrase “He lied
like a gentleman.” One of the things he
may not do is brag. Or, rather, he must not
do it crudely. For half a century Punch
has been -mildly lashing the profiteer who
shouts about his possessions. The man of
breeding talks diffidently of his little place
in the country which he knows you know' is
a mansion ; or he mentions his poverty and
whimsically deplores the indifference of his
or bridge-playing, though he has
±lO,OOO a year and plays all games unusu-
ally w'ell.
Until recent years a gentleman had to talk
grammatically and with a certain accent.
Then came the board schools. Hundreds of
thousands learned to pronounce their vowels
and mention their “g’s” ; and so it became
permissible, if not fashionable, to drop the
latter and bring a note of dialect into the
voice. West End actors and shop-girls articu-
late more correctly than many members of
White’s nowadays.
It used to be possible to get a line as to a
man’s social standing from the cut of his
clothes. Then the Jews came along, and,
metaphorically speaking, dressed the aristo-
cracy off Conduit-street. The modern Jew
is not as Disraeli was, “hung in chains like
a convict.” He may run a shady bucket-
shop, and yet buy his suits from Poole and
his boots from Peal and not indicate the
splendor of the Orient by so much as a
pearl pin. So a gentleman may be shabby,
and lots of them are—notably the Cecils,
Balfours and others of unchallengeable posi-
tion. Of course a gentleman may dress as
well as he likes without losing caste: he
may even over-dress, as the ex-Kaiser’s
friend Lord Lonsdale has done all his life.
But diamonds are barred.
A gentleman is allowed, strictly speaking,
to earn his living in very few professions—
the services, the Bar, diplomacy or the
Anglican Church. But this rule has been so
modified of late years that it is now possible
to belong to the Marlborough and be any-
thing down to a moneylender’s tout or pimp
for a gaming establishment. But he must
not be an auctioneer or a dentist; and doc-
tors are regarded with suspicion. The writer
heard a young Guardsman rebuke his wife
for bringing her brother, -who was a solici-
tor, to the house. “One. meets attorneys at
their offices,” the warrior remarked frigidly.
And now for some outsiders. First, by
general consent of his period, Napoleon. He
didn’t even fight like a gentleman, according
to his English critics; he spoke provincial
French, and his manners were bad —as when
he kicked a respected British ambassador in
the stomach before a crowded Court. Lord
Grenville (one of the family which, as Lord
Rosebery observes somewhere, “amassed a
fortune from the State with patience more
than Chinese’’) often complained that Nel-
son was not a gentleman. The Admiral was
originally in the merchant service, spoke
incorrectly, and had certain unpleasant
habits. It may be noted that, in the opinion
of many a modern Grenville, Fisher is no
gentleman. “Mr. Dickens,” said Lady
Derby to Queen Victoria, “struck me as a
very gentish person.” This was worse than
being a blatant cad, with unclean hands and
diamond and ruby rings.
But why drag m men of genius? It is
absolutely certain that Shakspeare wasn’t
commonly regarded as a. gentleman in his
day. Neither in the Victorian era was
Byron or Shelley or Swinburne, though all
belonged to the charmed circle by birth and
education. “Shame,” wrote Gibbon of John
Wilkes, "is a weakness which he has long
since surmounted,” Yet Wilkes remained a
popular social figure to the day of his death,
while Byron, his companion in the Hell
Fire Club, became an outcast. There was
no comparison, morally, between Wilkes and
Byron, but the poet was wicked in the
wrong way.
In 1917 the writer was with a Sydney
merchant who has lived obscurely in Lon-
don for many years past, and the conver-
sation turned on Winston Churchill. “A
capable fellow, Winston,” said my friend :
“but of course not a gentleman—hardly one
of us.” He went on to explain why the
Lord Chief Justice, H. G. Wells, F. E.
Smith (now Lord Chancellor) and the
Kaiser weren’t gentlemen. In the Kaiser’s
case it had ' nothing to do with the inva-
sion of Belgium: it was a matter of wear-
ing a yachting cap with civilian clothes on
one of his visits to Windsor. To the true
eclectic, neither high position nor great
talent has mattered in any age.
Valor used to be an essential. However,
since the Great War it has been excused.
The Dominion troops vulgarised it. “Stout
fellows, but socially impossible,” murmured
the man of breeding, and accepted a back-
area billet on a staff. As the war dragged
on the fact of being much in the front line
became almost a reflection on the soldier’s
status in Society. “The scenery is dreadful,
and none of my friends are there,” said
one aristocratic young man on being urged
by his Australian wife to join his regiment
in Flanders; and he remained in his home-
service billet.
“But all this,” the reader will complain,
“is purely negative.” That is so; for a
gentleman is himself a negation. He is
one who refrains from doing things. The
nearer he gets to beinv absolutely colorless
the closer he is to the idea aimed at. Search
the memoirs of the last two centuries, and
it will be noticed that, though men and
women are continually being appraised as
gentlefolks, the instances where the quality
is indicated by overt acts are rare. One
of the rarities was Lord Melbourne, Queen
Victoria’s cynical Prime Minister, whose
morals were nearly as bad as his language.
In 1836 he thought of making the uncon-
ventional and unpopular Dr. Hampden
Regius Professor of Divinity. Before
doing so he wrote to Archbishop Ilowley
giving his reason for favoring Hampden,
and he got a letter in reply approving of
the appointment. "A storm of protest fol-
lowed it. whereupon the Archbishop dis-
owned the whole business and denounced
Melbourne. Though the Prime Minister had
tlm Archbishop’s letter in his desk he re-
frained from publishing it. “That,” said
Yy. E. Gladstone, “was behaving something
like a real gentleman.” “Mark me,” said
Lord Randolph Churchill, “he had lost
the letter.”
WHITEHALI.
The Celtic Safety-Valve
Australian writers, with the few notable
exceptions of those who acknowledge a
foreign descent, are nearly all of Irish,
Scottish Highlands, Welsh or Cornish extrac-
tion. Those who do not come from the
countries where some form of the Celtic
language maintained itself to a late date are
so few that you could print all their names
on a threepenny bit. Of course, on Matthew
Arnold s theory, all the fine things in Eng-
lish are to be traced to a Celtic source—
only rectangular and commonplace things to
the Saxon. He may be right, and Australian
effort bears out his theory; but I have an
explanation to offer of the phenomenon
which is not in essence racial. The Celtic
languages are infinitely more expressive and
expansive than the Germanic ones ; and all
the writers referred to come of a stock which
for ages spoke and thought in the more ex-
pansive languages. At any time from, say,
SO to 200 years ago their ancestors ceased
to use their ancient tongues, and were shut
up within the narrower limits of English.
The struggle for expression in such a mental
cage finally found a safety-valve in the only
place where English broadens out; for
literary English is as rich as vernacular
English is poor. In other words, the person
of Celtic descent, or the one whose ancestors
used a Celtic tongue, is always trying sub-
consciously to think in that language. A
Welshman or an Irishman who "has no con-
scious knowledge at all of any language but
English will under the least stress of emotion
reverse his _ sentences, setting his verbs and
adjectives in the places they should have
filled in Celtic grammatical construction.
There the adjective, as in most languages,
should follow, not precede, the noun. Make
an Irishman angry enough or glad enough
and you will hear the adjective slipping
back into its place with some qualifying
phrase to make it seem right. Take' an
example. “He was riding a white horse” is
correct English construction. “He was riding
a horse white” would be Celtic construction,
or possibly “A horse white he was riding.”
Make the Irishman excited and he will be
almost sure to say “A horse white as the
devil he was riding.” The “as the devil” or
some equivalent phrase is the tribute he pavs
to his English education. But an English-
man would never turn his sentence that
way, _ though a Welshman would; and a
Cornishman, from longer association with
English, might be expected tr pu t the words
into such a tangle of linguistic effort that
only a very well-bred tin-mine could under-
stand them. Now, all that is proof that the
genius of the Celtic languages is sub-con-
sciously in the make-up of people of Celtic
tradition. Whether something of the lost
vocabulary is not there also in the thought
below the thought is matter for conjecture;
and it may even be, as some of us have
sometimes felt, that we dream in the colored
shadows of a language which no longer
comes to our lips. Then literary expression,
and especially literary expression in verse
form, relieves the pressure of perhaps two
centuries, and the wider English of books
and song supplies a heart’s need. The idea
may be . fantastic; but it is as good an
explanation of about six dozen people in
Australia as I can find.
D. MacULLADH.
Two Veterans
For half a century Edmund Gosse has
diligently delved with pick and shovel in
the fertile soil of English literature; and
his prose has shown an increasing mastery,
though tempered always with an undue
restraint. Author of poems, literary his-
tories, biographies, with but a single ven-
ture in fiction —“The Secret of Narcisse”—
this doyen of criticism will live chiefly in
his prose. An erudite French scholar, he
is at his best in the critical kit-cat style, as
when he describes how he once found Paul
Verlaine hidden in the cellar of a cafA
Though he became a master of form and
technique, his verse belongs entirely to an
older generation : it lacks spontaneity. From
his “Father and Son” to the latest “Diver-
sions of a Man of Letters” there is nothing
that he could not with perfect composure
have read in a Sunday-school. It is pro-
foundly critical and restrained. He re-
cently issued a studious, correct and gen-
teel life of Swinburne, whom he first saw
some 50 years ago being carried out in a
comatose condition from the British
Museum. All Swinburne’s escapades at
Oxford, his glorious mad revel with wine,
women and song, are most delicately
masqued by Gosse. The book is a triumph
of Bowdlerisation. Gosse has become gloss.
An adequate life of Swinburne could only
have been written by a George Moore, for
Gosse belongs to the artisan class in litera-
ture.
The author of “Tess” is nine years older
than Gosse. He was born at Upper Rock-
hampton in 1840; trained as an architect,
he trudged daily to an office in Dorchester,
experimented in art criticism, failed and
finally with, the production of “Desperate
Remedies” abandoned the drawing-board' for
the writing-pad. The attitude of Thomas
Hardy is that of a man become sorry for
nature. The music in his novels is the
music of the earth, the sap rising in the
hidden roots. He is a fatalist —the Millet
of fiction. He works in the same stern
media: labor, laughter, sorrow and disillu-
sionment —and “after that the dark.” He
does not expect to meet his Pilot face to
face: he can see no escape from the iron
grasp of fate : he voices no protest and no
hope. “The Return of the Native” stands
alone among the masterpieces of English
fiction, while “Jude the Obscure” is per-
haps the best and most unbiased eonsidera-
tion of the sex problem ever written. Hardy
is not a peasant any more than Stendhal
was a marquis; and yet his Wessex pea-
sants “untouched by the centuries, types of
enduring elements of humanity,” are at once
the simple and stupendous materials of his
art. He portrays the humblest of men and
the inscrutable power that breaks them one
by one on the wheel of doom. English men
of letters have recently paid their tribute
to this veteran novelist and poet in the
form of a manuscript volume in which each
of the poets wrote one of his own pieces,
and which was prefaced by an address writ-
ten by the Poet Laureate. No more fitting
tribute could have been paid by the younger
genei’ation of writers to the greatest of liv-
ing novelists.
REG S. ELLERY.
The Inky Way
Charlie Barrett is to edit the Young Aus-
tralia paper to be published by Melbourne
Herald. He sat at the feet of Donald
Macdonald years ago as a nature-study en-
thusiast and bird-lover. Macdonald intro-
duced him to J. E. Davidson, who put him
on the Herald and helped to make a jour-
nalist of him.
“Newsplane”: The new Sunraysia daily
at Mildura threatens to be the first news-
paper in Australia to have a regular deli-
very bjr air. The idea is to send its copies
by aeroplane to places like Swan Hill (Vic.),
which are comparatively close to Mildura
by air-line but a long way away by rail,
and to Balranald and various other places
in N. S. Wales that haven’t any railway.
Broken Hill may possibly be reached in the
same way.
“Bicrips” : Billy Moore, who is due from
London by the Benalla this month, extended
his war service ticket-of-leave for six months
as the chances of his Australian playlets
suddenly became rosy. Two all-Australian
farewells were tendered him. One was a
swagger affair given by the Bosnians at their
London home, and the other a Bohemian
breeze in a cafe. Among the rejoicing crew
were Dave Low, sister Dorothy and her
young man, Laurie Tayler, Will Hope and
Lance Mattisbn. Two resolutions were
adopted—one of them to establish a monthly
Australian Bite.
An Australian in London:—
Morley Roberts, 63 this year, author of “Time and
Thomas Wareing,” “Hearts o’ Women,” innumer-
able short stories, a life of George Gissing, etc.,
is thought by some to be one of the most interest-
ing men in London, as he certainly is one of the
handsomest, and by others the greatest bore. This
is because “It’s a fine day,” addressed to Morley,
is enough to set him off on meteorology up to the
present limits of human knowledge. He is especially
addicted to demolishing other people’s gods. He
regards Shakspeare’s works as over-rated, and prefers
his own short stories to Kipling’s. As a youth his
living was earned on sea and land by the sweat of
his brow; some of.it in the Australian bush about
18 r 6, which of course makes him an authority on
our country. His eld has been devoted to the study
of sciences, principally biology and pathology. He
describes himself now as a living museum of physio-
logical curiosities, a remark which might really be
made of anybody. He can’t draw, but he has an
exceptional eye for color effects, and has recently
done well in London with a small one-man show,
mainly of water-colors. When he is not working he
is either playing chess or talking, and he gets
some sardonic satisfaction from proving to the con-
sulting specialists of Harley-street that at least one
of their patients can teach them their own sciences.
He likes Galsworthy, and approves of some of
Shelley’s poems.
Mrs. Warren's Daughter, by Sir H. H.
Johnston (Chatto and Windus). This
writer is a self-made man from the dismal
district of Ivennington Oval. He studied
painting till his 22nd year and then started
to explore Africa. When 28 he found Mount
Kilimanjaro, and his career began. He has
gone on annexing large lumps of Empire,
writing volumes about them, decorating his
chest with orders, and prospering. Then he
began novel writing and published his first
bit of fiction at over 60 years of age. It
was “The _Gay-Dombeys.” It took the Dom-
beys of Dickens a generation after and made
such fun of them that five impressions went
like wildfire. Then, after seeking Bernard
Shaw’s permission, he has taken Vivien War-
ren out of the play (where you will remem-
ber she finds that the “profession” her
mother practises is the old one of Mistress
Quickly’s, rendered ten thousand times more
payable by modern invention), and sets her
to work to get the suffrage for women, and
so pay back partly her illgotten gains. It
was a bold idea, and as soon as you get it
into your hands you are bound to rush
through its 400 pages. Sir Harry is a ready
writer. His pen runs away with him —but
that is what you want in such a story. He
introduces loads of real people—the Panics
and the Peths roam through the story. As-
quith and his myrmidons are cursed when
they appear—but that does little harm. The
weak spot is the ease with which Vivien
disguises herself as a barrister and bril-
liantly defends the lone, lorn women. The
best part lies in the description of Belgium
during the war, and here the hurried, slap-
dash style helps rather than binders.
HOW POETS KEEP YOUNG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was a factory for groans ;
He earned his bread with sighs and tears
And drove a lively trade in moans.
What’s more, he kept it up for years.
That wasn’t all. When called upon
He piped and made Spring’s lambkins bound,
Till people thought his brain had gone
Through riding on Youth’s merry-go-round.
He wrote three things that shine like gold,
And thousands more with scarce a gleam;
On life he never got a hold,
But lived within a sort of dream.
The solid folk who paid their way
And took life gravely shook their heads;
The poet was a boy gone grey
When Death was waiting at their beds.
The Recipe.
Let your heart go like a balloon;
Hang on and joy-ride in the blue;
Your earthly- cares will very soon
Belong to everyone but you.

“Pittsworth”: One man on the Darling
Downs was feeding his pigs on horseflesh
till the drought broke. He could buy horses
at the Toowoomba markets for £l, or less,
whereas a pig recently fetched £l9 at a
Warwick sale.

“Foam”: The sheep show at Campbell
Town (Tas.) claims to be the oldest south
of the line. The first was held in 1839, and
it has been run every year since, so that
what it had the other day was the 82nd in
succession. It is still mostly a merino show,
with the Gibsons and Taylors scooping in
most of the prizes; but other breeds get
a look in nowadays.
* ' * * *
“P.M.”: Suburban folks in Adelaide who
are lucky enough to have a few olive-trees
in the back yard are joyful, with olives at
40s. a cwt. The Black Forest State School,
which has a row of the beautiful trees, got
£l7 this year towards the school funds from
the sale of the berries, and it wfis unlucky
enough to sell before the market jumped.
It’s a nice, thrifty idea for school-grounds.
* * * *
“Ben Trovato”: Bacchus Marsh (Vic.)
land cost Money Miller as much as £2 10s.
an acre in 1850. Seventy years later a
lucerne farm sold for £l4O an acre not far
from Money’s place, and now nine acres
have fetched £152 an acre, while a paddock
of three acres brought £465. These are
record prices for the district. The soil is
volcanic, and the local people believe that
Bacchus Marsh was originally a crater and
that the roots of the lucerne reach down
to Tophet.
* * * *
“Forester”: The Tasmanian Huon pine
yields not only the best softwood native to
Australia (or anywhere else), but an essen-
tial oil which so interested British manu-
facturers of perfumes that they have asked
for information as to prices and quantities.
The tree yields by distillation a pale straw-
colored oil with an odor of the methyl-eugenol
much used in the scent trade. But, unfor-
tunately, the Huon pine is getting very
scarce, so it doesn’t matter as much as it
would have done 50 years ago.
* * * *
“Broker”: Australian vignerons, who re-
fused a £50,000 contract six months ago on
account of insufficient supplies, still turn
down business that other countries would
snap at. The fear of a Prohibition referen-
dum has discouraged many small vignerons,
and some Diggers who took up the game in
a small way have turned it in. Yet the
export trade is but a bagatelle of what it
might be. Britain alone demands an imme-
diate quadrupling of supplies, and' Scandi-
navia has developed a thirst that keeps the
local bottle industry in full blast. Now
Japan, which, until the advent of Prohibition
in America, drew her supplies exclusively
from California, is in the Sydney market
offering contracts for a minimum supply of
£130,000 annually, and fighting hard to get
them signed. Such a trade might easily rival
the importance of wool and wheat, but the
prospect has failed to impress any Aus-
tralian statesman. Protecting by a prefer-
ential excise duty an industry which is liable
to be extinguished by a capricious vote will
never increase production.
* * * *
“Hawker”: We Melbourne people may be
soberer, but I don’t know that we are any
honestef, since 6 o’clock closing became
fashionable. My milk-o friend earnestly
demanded to know why we townies don’t
drink more beer. “I’m only milking 25
when I ought to be doing 40,” he explained.
“I’ve got to keep the others. And you
fellows won’t drink enough beer, so we
can’t get brewers’ grains; and we can’t
get patent feeds, can’t get oat-hulls —even
at 4s. 6d. a bag where we used to pay 10d.—
can’t get anything.” “Why,” I asked, “don’t
you buy some bran?” “Bran!” he shrieked.
“The price is fixed at £8 10s., and the Prices
Commissioners would like to be told of any-
one who is charging, more than that for it.
Would they? I got itwo tons last week that
cost me over £2O, and the Lord knows if
I’ll be able to get another lot. I certainly
wouldn’t if I told the Prices Commissioners.”
I said I’d try to push things on by swallow
ing another pint a dg y.
THE FOSSICKER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Old Billy wagged his cradle by the side of Blister
Creek.
Scarce was the gold the ancient so much trouble
took to seek.
From out his barrow Billy shovelled tailings by the
ton;
He toiled from early morning: it was dark ere he
was done.
He’d done it years unnumbered and a poor old man
was Bill —
A proof, too, that rheumatics take a lot of time to
kill.
He ladled in the water, and he shook the cradle
well,
And when the week was done had only pennyweights
to sell.
One day inside the hopper Billy found a dreadful
bone.
He looked it over closely, and aside the thing was
thrown.
Next shovel brought another, but perhaps old Bill
was dull,
And didn’t quickly recognise the brainpan of a skull.
He cradled on. O’er bone by bone the cleansing
waters ran,
Till Bill had cleaned up all the bony fragments of
a man.
The gruesome stack beside him lay, the grinning
javvs on top,
And Billy scraped his barrow out, and found it
time to stop.
He washed the slides, the ripples too, the bit of
blanket sluiced,
Then panned the lot off, and but half a pennyweight
produced.
He stood a while; the broken bones he cursed with
biting spleen—
“ The bloomin’ pauper,” Billy said, “he died without
a bean!”

DELCO-LIGHT is the
Best Time and Labor
Saver on my Farm.”
Delco-Light users, everywhere—over 100,000 of them—think
and say this about Delco-Light. Nearly every testimonial letter
contains such a sentence. It is proof of the satisfactory service
Delco-Light gives. It is an indication of the place taken by
Delco-Light in the hearts of those who have installed it.
The clear rays of electric lights make the house, the barn or
the farmyard bright as day, at the touch of a button. The
electric current pumps and carries the water just where you
want it, and performs a score of other jobs swiftly and silently
while you are doing something else.
The experience of Delco-Light Users and their combined opinion
is the best proof we have to offer, of two things—that
Delco-Light is mechanically correct—and that it is a paying
investment.

Just
Like New
ANY housewife can easily
A keep her home clean
and bright by devoting a
little attention to her furniture, woodwork, floors and
linoleum. All they need is an occasional application of
Johnson’s Prepared Wax. This cleans, polishes and pro-
tects the finish, adding years to its life and beauty.
Johnson’s Prepared Wax imparts a hard, dry, glasslike
polish of great beauty and durability. It covers up mars
and small surface scratches —preserves the varnish—and
prevents checking and cracking.
Liquid and Paste
Johnson’s Prepared Wax contains no oil consequently it
does not gather or hold the dust and it never becomes soft
or sticky in the hottest weather or from the heat of the
body. It will quickly and permanently remove that bluish,
cloudy appearance from your piano and mahogany furniture.
Johnson’s Prepared Wax is made in liquid form as well
as paste. Use paste for all floors—wood, marble, tile, lino-
leum, etc. We advise the liquid for polishing furniture,
woodwork, leather goods, etc.
A Dust-Proof Auto Polish
Automobile owners will find Johnson’s Liquid Wax the
most satisfactory polish for their cars. It sheds water and
dust and makes a "wash” last,twice as long. Protects and
preserves the varnish. Write for our folder on "Keeping
Your Car Young”— it’s free.

“Sucking ,Med” : A patient lobbed iijto our
hospital complaining of eye trouble. “Have
a good look at that eye, boys,” said the
doctor to his students, as he prepared to
depart. “That sort of choroiditis is always
syphilitic.” Presently in bustled his col-
league. Seeing a group of animated white
coats in the corner, he came over to examine
the exhibit. “Oh, yes, yes! Choroiditis ! Not
a very rare condition. I’ve had it five or
six times myself.”
Somebody recently put it to Chief Secre-
tary Dooley, of- N. S. Wales, that rates and
taxes payable by the private employer should
be charged up against State enterprises.
“Impossible,” replied Dooley, pitying the in-
quirer’s ignorance; “it would falsify the
result. When the profit of an ordinary busi-
ness is ascertained the State takes a certain
proportion of it by way of income tax. When
the profits of a State undertaking are ascer-
tained the whole of the profits are taken as
State revenue, or income.” The instructive
Dooley recently complained that the State
trawlers, which he controls, were well on
the way to losing £57,000. Presumably he
uses a distorting mirror to ascertain the
profits. v
“Ex-Dig.” : Sydney possesses an astonished
Digger who arranged for the passage of his
fiancee from Scotland and was met on the
arrival of the boat by her sister. A letter
from the faithless one explained that she
had married someone else, and that, as her
sister was anxious to get to Australia, she
had sent that part of the family as a sub-
stitute.. Sister blushfully added that she
did not expect the soldier to marry her,
and that she would repay any expense in-
curred directly she started earning money;
but he replied that she seemed a likely sort
of girl, and he s’posed her finger would fit
the ring as well as the other lady’s. So the
bells of St. Mary’s will perform as usual.
The reflections of an old Laborite: —
N. S. Wales Labor Conference ought to consider
whether the plan of selecting Ministers by members
of the Parliamentary party should stand. In the
first place, the election is usually held after a
general appeal to the country, in which many new
members are returned. In most cases these men
know nothing at all about the candidates. Apart
from this, when 45 or more supreme egotists and
masters of intrigue have only about 16 jobs to go
round, some fine old manoeuvring is to be expected.
To start with, any one of the crowd prefers himself
to any other of the bunch; many of them would
rather himself than all the others put together.
This spirit can be depended upon to show itself in
“throw-off” and thrdw-away votes, the accidental
accumulation of which may easily make a, Minister
of a man who is regarded as a particularly hopeless
ass, incidentally putting a good man out. And
suppose 15 or 25 of them put their heads together
and run a solidarity ticket, just by way of giving
themselves a good kick-off, what then? J. C. Watson,
who selected the first Federal Labor Ministry in
1904, always maintained that the leader should do
the selecting, and the years have not proved him
wrong. |
That bqll-doggy cleric, Rev. J. B. Ronald,
of Melbourne, is back from England, where
he has spent eight months pursuing his
vendetta (it is a 14-year-old vendetta now)
with the ghost of Robert Harper. Ronald
was a Federal member as well as a Presby-
terian parson, and Harper, who was also
Presbyterian and a member, alleged that he
said something or drank something-—the
details are almost forgotten now —which
might be all right for a politician but
didn’t fit into the scheme of things for a
parson. In the heat that ensued Ronald
lost his church and his party’s nomination
for Parliament. He pursued Harper in the
courts and lost, and then he pursued the
witnesses who had supported Harper’s case,
and no less than 10 were sent t 6 gaol for
perjury. All the same, neither the State
Fuil Court nor the Federal High Court
thought that the indignant clerical politician
had made out his case for a new trial, so
Ronald has been in England seeing the King
about it. He wants the return of his seat
in Parliament or some satisfaction for the
same, restoration of his clerical job with 14
years’ back pay and £lO,OOO from Harper’s
estate. Certainly Ronald has tenacity, but
14 years is a lot of time to spend out of a
man’s life, especially as Solomon said that
man lives but once. If man could only live
backwards, being a baby in his old age and
an experienced veteran in his subsequent
youth, he wouldn’t waste so much of his
spring-time chasing will-of-the-wisps.
From Macquarie Street: —
The Ked Cross Society has decided to launch a
“farm colony” for the treatment of tuberculous
Diggers a few miles from Yanco (N.S.W.), where
100 acres have been set aside for the experiment.
Although the scheme lacks the comprehensiveness
of similar undertakings in Europe, it is a step
forward. Many of the men will, however, find the
work too monotonous, and will naturally prefer
to get back to the occupation that was theirs before
they became ill, or something approaching it; so
in future undertakings the choice of occupations
will have to be extended considerably.
In this connection the Red Cross, or any other
body of philanthropic tendencies, will do well to
follow closely the noteworthy enterprise run by
Dr. Varrier Jones at Papworth Hall, near Cam-
bridge. Many trades and occupations are taught
there, and, what is more, 30 “advanced beds” have
been set aside for the reception of those cases which
are usually turned out of hospitals as hopeless, and
which have not the slightest show of getting near
the usual sanatoria. The success of any “colony”
scheme lies in the fact that all inmates are under
medical supervision and control. At the present
day much good time and money is thrown away
in getting phthisical patients into good fighting
trim, and then losing sight of them entirely until
another breakdown occurs —due nearly always to
neglect of the doctor’s admonition to be sure to
keep themselves fit.
A comprehensive scheme run on scientific lines
would necessarily have to be handy to a metropolis
or a railway in order to secure a ready market
for the produce of the community. At Papworth
many occupations are taught, amongst them car-
pentering, metal-work, engineering jobs, bee-keeping,
poultry-farming, pig-raising, dairywork and market-
gardening. Carpenters’ workshops have been erected
as well as engineering sheds, the idea being to engage
in the manufacture of petrol-driven agricultural
machines.
Although the Yanco scheme is not likely to
benefit scientific medicine to any great extent, it
will serve as a guide to other more ambitious pro-
posals which are certain to follow in due time.

More of the ill-effects of the tariff. The
.■entury-old Chubb and Sons, instead of
giving Australia’s safes and locks the
benefit of a 12,000-mile water journey, are
going to put the Commonwealth to the
bother of manufacturing its own “security”
requirements in future. The works are to
be designed to undertake all Chubb’s latest
ideas in fire- and thief-resisters, and the
co. will also produce general steelwork, such
as lift-enclosures, window-frames, etc.
From the Federal Gallery:—
Towards the end of the last Parliament one of
Hughes’s sharpest critics was William Higgs. In his
maddening, sepulchral manner the tall man continu-
ally baited the midget, and, so far as the world
knows, his bitterness was never appeased by any
courtesy or conciliation from his . badgered victim.
But now with the' threat of an early election throw-
ing them on the mercy of their angry constituents,
the old enemies find it easy to forget their differences
and creep together for mutual protection. Higgs is
seeking admission to the Nationalist camp, and for
the sake of his vote his request will probably be
granted.
Sydney Museum will soon be something
more than a dry repository of dead bones
and stuffed skins. Following the example
of the Zoo, it is reconstructing, so far as it
can, the real-life conditions of the beasts and
birds it exhibits. Artists are painting in the
backgrounds, and the stock will be grouped by
cunning hands. One of the tableaux pro-
jected is a reconstruction of a South Polar
picture, with the beasts and birds brought
back by the Mawson expedition in the fore-
ground. If a musuem must still remain a
morgue this one intends to be a cheerful
morgue.
“Centurion”: It was in Cathedral-street,
Sydney. A small group of down-for-the-
Princers watched a black van pull up at
a side gate. Four sepulchral men drew out
a stretcher on which lay something long and
heavy, covered with a cloth. The watchers
reverently removed their hats. There was
a faint odor of disinfectant as the bearers
carried their doleful burden away to the
sheds behind the Museum. One or two of
the crowd looked a little white. Said the
dapper individual who came back to close
the gate: “Accident? Lord, no! That’s a
very rare specimen of the beaked dolphin serrt
from Bondi to the Museum to make
a plaster cast of.”
“Rounds”: Some favorite pubs in the
centre of Melbourne, clubbable sorts of
places, are threatened by the Licenses Reduc-
tion Board, because they have not any eat-
ing and sleeping rooms to speak of. The
City Club, beside the Argus office, where
the Press Club had its home for a couple
of years, is among the houses on the list,
and the Board has been asked to spare it
as it is “a charmed circle” and well con-
ducted. Certainly there are many score
men with no club membership whose
limited pleasures in life would be appre-
ciably reduced by the disappearance of this
shrine. Its devotees lounge mainly from
4.30 to 5.45 in the afternoon, and are fel-
lows who earn their spell-o.
After a recent rush of a crowd of unem-
ployed into. Sydney Government offices a
new complaint arose—that when some loan-
money jobs were handed out the first men
served were those who had been longest on
the register, not (as was held should have
been the case) those who mobbed the offi-
cial premises first. A similar theory was
advanced in Queensland on behalf of the
men who took possession of Minister
Fiholly’s room and held a smoke-concert
there. This is a powerful reason why the
political centre should be in a minor town,
as is the case with the U.S. Federal capital
and 35 of the State capitals, and in Canada,
South Africa and Maoriland. In old days
the biggest, city was often made the capital,
or the capital became the biggest city, be-
cause it was the biggest fortress and the
handiest place to mass the hug-e necessary
army. Australia doesn’t need these old
Middle-Age habits, with their attendant dis-
asters. This country shows the first signs
of the lamentable idea that any mob of the
great city, which, being great, can most
easily raise a mob, should receive special
consideration because it is at hand to in-
vade the Premier’s office and bounce a brick
off his head if he doesn’t agree to whatever
it may propose. This tends to put control
into the hands of the one city and of the
brick-throwing section in one city.
“Haragigi”: The rum-guzzling Don .Tuan
described by “Marsina” (B. 15/4/’2O) as
typical of the Papuan magistracy may have
been conspicuous in the service 20 years ago.
Under modern conditions he would last about
as long as it would take an account of his
playfulness to reach headquarters. He would
then probably join the army of recruiters
and “traders,” and devote the remainder of
his stay in Papua to slanging the Murray
administration and its alleged lack of sym-
pathy with white settlement, or join in futile
agitations for the recall of ‘ the Lieut.-
Governor. The claim that the life and pro-
perty of the white man are as safe in Papua
as they are in any part of Australia is no
idle boast, and it is time the work of the
shamefully-underpaid resident magistrates
and their assistants received recognition.
There seems to be a popular impression that
any man is capable of carrying out the duties
of a resident magistrate. Hear what a
senior officer has to say about it
Such officers must have a working knowledge of
the Justices Act, the various Small Debts Acts, the
exceedingly complicated Mining Act, the Papuan
Laws and Ordinances, the Criminal Code, the Intes-
tacy Act, the Native Regulations, the Postal Regula- ■
tions. He must also understand book-keeping, infan-
try drill, bone-setting and simple surgery; also
medicine, road-making, surveying, building construc-
tion, boat sailing and the Motuan language. He
must learn the attitude of the different tribes to-
wards the Government and to one .another, and their
peculiarities; he must be physically capable of
resisting malaria and dysentery, and of keeping pace
with the constabulary in long, rough marches., He
must maintain discipline in the gaols and on the
station, as well as among two or three hundred
crude savages employed as carriers and laborers. He
must be prepared to live months alone with the
natives, to spend most of his pay in camp expenses
and at the end of a few years to have his health shat-
tered and be useless for any other occupation.
The newly-formed Public Seryice Association
is the only union in Papua. I do not think
that it arrived a day too soon.

Australian Plays, Ltd., had a great kick-
oil with “The Boss Cockie” at the Victoria,
Newcastle, on Saturday night; there was
a house packed to the roof with people who
came to laugh and got full weight for their
money. The show worked a bit too long
for the last, of the steam-trams, but it will
go closer. “The Boss Cockie” is a cheerful
grin in four acts. The types are all Aus-
tralian of the city and the bush. Richard
Bellairs finds himself as Aladdin Biddulfson
and C. R. Stanford as the Boss Cockie
who is bound to be loved of audiences for
his humor, kindliness and strength. The
cast is true to type and lias sufficient punch.
The first acts in particular have plenty or
snap, and the laughs almost merged at such
jokes as “He has so many kids he has run
out of names—he earmarks ’em now”;
You re a great schlanterer—-you could get
birdseed out of a cuckoo clock”; and the
story of the Dark Bloke who pinched the
black bull at Muttaburra. There is also a
man with a standing grievance of another
who ‘shook eight postholes off him,” and
a cheerful lunatic who punctuates a flood
with intimations that the tank’s full. Beryl
Monday makes Judy Grouthead a new type
of bush-girl, full of humor and independ-
ence, and her education is a great joke.
Gwen Dorise played with restraint and
charm. Charles Daniels was capital as a
heavy-weight tragedian, and did a drunken
act in amusing style. The also-rans were
not without merit. “The Boss Cockie” will
win wherever the Australian slanguage is
spoken, and on Saturday night even Ran-
dolph Bedford smiled. It is due in Bris-
bane July 17, and at Sydney Royal August
“Kissing Time” keeps on earning grease-
paint and a bit over at Her Majesty’s, and
Sydney is doing its duty by haunting the
tuneful show.
The people are hurrying down from the
drought areas to hear the J. and N. Tait
thunderstorm booming and splashing in
“Tiger Rose” at Sydney Palace. With Marie
Ilka’s tears and the rain on the roof it’s
a wild, damp evening’s entertainment.
Fresh from making an arrangement with
the N. S. Wales Government by which Aus-
tralia retains him at a salary of £l5OO a
year and £25 per concert (if there is that
much left for him). Verbrugghen appeared
in Sydney Town Hall on Monday night with
the Conservatorium Orchestra and the
Hamilton choir. Heaven only knows why
Hamilton, a suburb in the untidy back yard
of Newcastle, should have such a choir; but.
at any rate, some of its work in “The
Messiah” was as good as any that has been
heard in the hall, even when the Sheffield
Choir did the singing. Of course the pro-
duction was not uniform ; but where extra-
ordinary vigor was called for, Hamilton,
handled by Verbrugghen, supplied the goods.
The solo parts were less satisfactory.
The Tivoli, H. D. Mclntosh, Miss Lee
White and all the people of “Bran Pie”
earned Sydney’s gratitude this week by hav-
ing a matinee and raking in £l5OO for the
Crown-street Women’s Hospital.
Harry Kaigh Eustace stands at the Play-
house offering the youth of Sydney tigers
with one hand' and lions with the other,

At Sydney Strand handsome Eugene
O’Brien refuses to live on “His Wife’s
Money,” and tries to break Marion’s ten-
thousand-a-year a la carte appetite down to
the £5OO-a-year table d’hote. Marion refuses
to be rationed and seeks the bubble consola-
tion with another, while husband seeks the
nugget on the hilltop. When he has found
it in sufficient quantity the play ends on the
usual reconciliation embrace. Bland Holt’s
old favorite, “The Breaking of the Drought,”
has come to town and is living up to its
title. The film man has caught all the har-
rowing detail of the Outback when the piti-
less sun burns day after day until Cocky
and his wife see their all consumed. The
Grand shows the picture. Irene Castles, as
“The Amateur Wife,” manages to put up
a record while the husband she has lassoed
with her convent-school innocence is away
from home. He leaves her a shy bird and
comes back to find her “the toast of the
town”—evidently hot stuff. Anita Stewart
as “The Fighting Shepherdess” demonstrates
at Crystal Palace and Lyceum her right to
the monopoly of handing gin-and-bitters over
her own bar in the cow country of Cali-
fornia. And later on she shows the wild and
woolly quick-shooters who live in her neigh-
borhood that no brand but her own goes on
any of her flocks and herds. Anita has a
way with her. At the Lyceum alone Corinne
Griffiths goes through “The Bramble Bush”
in 14 different gowns.
“The Passing Show of 1920” at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s makes no direct allusion
to the present year, except in the scene
where a slender fairy whisks Phil Smith
back to 1914. Elsewhere the “Show” is the
usual incongruous string of absurdities,
songs and dances in which the "Passing”
can often be changed to “Passe” with
advantage. The sweetest incidents are
always the achievement of Australian legs,
and there are no prettier pictures than the
ceremonious posturing in “The Lamp of
Love” and the graceful study of the Gav-
otte Watteau with a set of tender coryphees
decorating the illusion. In other scenes
there are some haunting mannequin displays,
but these outbursts of Fashion hardly cause
a rush of Girl to the head.
* * * *
The skits and sketches have an occasional
gleam of insanity, but in most respects
they are kept lively by Jennie Hartley and
Phil Smith battling obtrusively for the final
word. Smith is a very active citizen
throughout, generally observing his commis-
sion to create public disorder with a face
like a toothache and several sleepless
nights. Philip also discloses a large check
wardrobe and a mop of vermilion hair.
Jennie Hartley’s liveliness in various-cos-
tumes is merely the expression of a rather
tarty personality, and she looks most at-
home as a Cockney lydy demanding Love in
hunks from an over-buttoned partner. Ilet-
tie Hartley, conspicuous in an item with
Smith, a baby and perambulator, exercises a
ponderous humor. Herbert Walton, as a
handy man in sundry scenes, has comedy
thrust upon him by the ole-clo’ department.
Leslie Victor’s entrances are almost simul-
taneous with his exits as a ridiculous
Frenchman, but he manages to import some
fury into his exhibitions. Eardley Turner

A Gallipoli show in Melbourne:—
Eighty Gallipoli sketches by Sapper Moore-Jones
have found a refuge in Queen’s Hall, Federal Parlia-
ment House, where they will have little chance of
being inspected by the general public. The drawings
are in pencil and water-color, and while rather short
of human interest give a vivid idea of the dazzling
inclines to which Billjim clung for weary months.
The ruggedness of the bloody mile around Anzac
Cove is well illustrated in the panoramic view from
the sea (No. 3) and smaller drawings of terraced
salients. Moore-Jones has a delicate sense of color,
and the tender loveliness of some of the scenes shows
that he has an artist’s eye for a picture. Especially
commendable are the impression in pink, lavender and
mauve (No. 70) and the sweeping view from Mac-
lagan’s Ridge (No. 6). The little pencil sketches
are very good, and the water-color of stretcher-bearer
Simpson and his donkey, Murphy, suggests that as
a portrait-painter the sapper might win at least a
crown.
THE POSSIBLE TROUBLE.
TRAGEDLAN : “I find it difficult to get any-
thing to do.”
LOW COMEDY LADY : “Perhaps it is because
you insist on acting, dearie.”
Though described as the Napoleon of
Magic, Carter at Melbourne Princess’s
doesn’t meet his Waterloo in any of the
tricks of his trade. He goes through an
evening’s deception with a facility never
admitting the possibility of failure, his quick
lingers producing effects as stunning as the
results of his more elaborate illusions. The
amateur conjurer will admire the slick finish
of his opening “Bouquet of Mysteries”
wherein the “Astral Hand” is the most for-
midable feature, tapping out answers to
questions on a sheet of glass. Allowing for
the maximum of mechanical deceit, the
larger tricks still have points about them
that keep the most experienced guessing.
The lady who is found in the trunk near the
roof of the theatre is not more astounding
than the vanishing lion. “The Crystal Cas-
ket of Creation” is another good dodge, and
the mystery of the stolen clobber in an amaz-
ing cabinet trick reduces the feats of our
finest housebreakers to the level of bag-
snatching. Carter is assisted by a fetching
young lady, Evelyn Maxwell, who has a
period of thought-reading on lines made
familiar by the Howard Brothers and others.
She peers into numerous minds at every sit-
ting, but judging by her announcements
she isn’t greatly exhilarated by her dis-
coveries.
At Melbourne King’s the chafige of bill is
almost due. After Friday night Kay Souper
will cease to hurt the feelings of the Little
Damozel by apprising her of the fact that
he was heavily subsidised for marrying her.
Saturday’s bill is “Kindling,” wherein the
co. will be reinforced by Maggie Moore and
H. It. Roberts.

“Yes, Uncle,” at Melbourne Royal, is still
endeavoring to put a bold front on its allega-
tion that all girls go mad over William
Greene. William in himself shows no rea-
son for the song he sings about his vast
personal attractions, neither do his dozen or
so of unnecessary models seem to adore
him more than they dote upon Frith, whose
manly beauty has never yet found adequate
expression in his face. It’s a beautiful
nature that Frith has, not a lovely physiog-
nomy. For that matter, Greene also
appears to be a chivalrous philanthropist
where his academy of models is concerned.
The girls run about the artist’s studio like
rabbits, and even if the union didn’t see to
it that these nymphs received a living
wage for doing nothing in gauze bathing-
gowns they would still be getting ample
payment in unaffected kindness.

“The Man from Toronto” has got Mel-
bourne by the ear at the Tivoli, and, strikes
permitting, the joyous comedy will run
many weeks. Audiences are already on
friendlv terms with the nine characters in
the east. Expansive Mrs. Hubbard (Miss
Lester) and her fantastic ewe-lamb (Miss
Graham) are only there a couple of minutes,
for the sole dramatic purpose of leaving a
photo behind them, but they count in the
sum total of approval. People remember the
Hubbards as visitors of the sort that might
happen to anybody. Also the precepts of
Bobbie and the protests of Mr. Priestley are
remembered in tram-cars and repeated in
railway-carriages, and womankind mostly
commends Leila for acting on the old man’s
hint of artfulness instead of being persuaded
by cousin Robert to lie down and let destiny
roll her out like a slab of dough.

The Russian pian-

Melbourne’s limited
stock of musical en-

a pause of three weeks
to admit of replenish-
ment before Laurence

dodges the threatened

to fifi. an empty cor-
ner in a young girl’s
heart. This sensational story whizzes on to
Hoyt’s screen in Melbourne this week under
the title of “The Speed Maniac.” Also run-
ning on the same bill is “Bonnie Lassie,”
a raw Scotch girl who goes to Noo Yark
and gets into the society of a naughty mil-
lionaire. Frank Mayo is now doing a week
of brute-taming at Hoyt’s St. Kilda branch,
where May Allison is staging a welcome
smile in “The Walk-Offs.” The Majestic
has captured Charlie Chaplin in “A Day’s
Pleasure,” and Charlie’s antics with his lid
and limbs double up old and young. Many
people who have seen this circus are now
going about with a permanent bend in the
middle. On Charlie’s track creeps the brood-
ing Jap, Sesrsue Hayakawa, in a Chinese
slum picture, “The Tong Man.” The yarn
is laid in darkest San Francisco, and Sessue
has many scenes for his countenance to
gloom in.

Melbourne sees more decorations: —
Though here and there her art is mechanical and
her fancy flags, Miss E. L. Spowers shows in her
exhibition at the Decoration gallery in Collins-
street considerable promise as an illustrator. Her
best work is in black and white, where the use
of massed blacks and a whimsical pen-line suggest
the influence of Aubrey Beardsley. In “The Model"
and “The Beautiful Parrot” we get the Aubrey
technique without the flaunting Beardsleering manner.
The quality of her colored drawing varies. Nowhere
is she absolutely delectable, but she gives the
insouciance of Harlequin and Columbine, of Pierrot
and Pierrette, and pictures the visions of the nursery
in a charming and tender spirit. “The Peacock”
and the “Illustration to the Frog Prince” are the
prize-takers in this section, and a couple of other
clever designs, “Echo” and “The Chain of
Flowers,” come out well in a wash of Indian ink.
“The Mill, Warrandyte,” a small study in water-
color, with a dainty atmospheric effect, ought to
encourage her to further adventures in landscape
painting.
Shows in Adelaide are mostly song, but
occasionally dance. There is a rush of
light stuff. The jolly “Mimi” crowd of Dig-
gers has moved on from the King’s to work
the Port and country towns; but the Digger
Pierrots have taken possession of the Royal
with' their pleasant programme of sketch
diversified by music. Hanna scores as a
padre and also as lightning crayon-sketcher,
and Stan Lawson makes a graceful girl.
The co. seems to have an unlimited reper-
tory. At the Tivoli “Oddments” is making
way for a new co. with “His Little
Widows.” Drama is to have a chance, with
Eugenie Duggan, at the King’s. Carl Formes
is singing at Wondergraph, which has a
jolly picture, “The Six Best Cellars,” where-
in America makes fun of its own Pro-
hibition. Nazimova, in the tremendous
“Red Lantern” drama of Japan, is at
West’s. The Grand is giving good music
with its pictures, and at the Pav., which
has been encoring “Ginger Mick” with great
effect, Chaplin and Louise, Glaum now com-
pete against each other.
The record-breaking “Maid of the Moun-
tains” ceased climbing at Daly’s Theatre,
London, at the beginning of May. The
score was 1352, which would represent well
over four years with six shows a week; but
as a fact they averaged eight.

THE NEW MAXWELL
WHEN builders of any motor car had produced 50,000
cars on a single motor design, they might rightly feel
that perfection had about been reached.
But Maxwell Motor Car builders know that progress demands
that each day contribute something to the joy of motoring without
sacrificing economy in petrol, tyres and spares or adding to the
cost of the car.
Passing the 50,000 mark the Maxwell Motor Car builders
began diligent improvements in minor details. 300,000 Maxwell
Cars, built upon the original simple motor plan, have made it
possible to sell more comfort, longer service, and more economy in
operation. There is more genuine beauty in to-day s Maxwell than
ever before.
You will be agreeably surprised with to-day s Maxwell.

Alkali Causes Soap
To Injure Hair.
Nearly all soaps and ready-mixed shampoos
—even the most expensive—contain too much
alkali, which is dangerous, as it dries the
scalp and makes the hair brittle.
Really the most elegant and safe thing to
use is ordinary colinated cocoanut oil (a pure,
saponified but quite greaseless liquid), which
is not at all expensive—but is far, far better
than soaps or other scalp-injurious things.
Every chemist keeps a supply of this, and a
few ounces lasts you and mother, sisters and
brothers for months. Just wet the hair with
water and rub it through—thoroughly. One
or two teaspoonfuls is plenty to create a big
quantity of rich, heavy, creamy lather. It
cleanses delightfully and rinses out easily.
The hair dries quickly and easily, and comes
out brilliant, soft, fluffy, wavy and fresh as a
daisy, looking much thicker than it actually
is.
Best of all. this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. And yet
It loosens and carries off every bit of excess
oiliness, dust, dirt or dandruff scurf.
IMPORTANT. —Do not confuse colinated cocoanut
oil with cheaper sticky, emulsified cocoanut oils
dr other substitutes. There is only one genuine
colinated cocoanut oil, as recommended above-.

table. Never Let a Corn Ache Again!
Like a Flash! Few Drops Stop Corns Throbbing,
. Then Corns and Callouses Wither Up, Loosen
and Lift Out Like a Cork—Painlessly!
THE Australian people owe a
debt of gratitude to toe wizard
in chemistry who formulated the
new ether discovery named
Frozol-Ice.
Little phials of this
wonder liquid are now
obtainable from any chem-
ist for a few pence. You
merely apply a few drops
of tlqs Frozol-Ice on a ten-
■ i v der, aching corn or tough-
ened callous. Right away all
soreness vanishes, and soon you see the
corn or callous that loose and withered
that it lifts out with the fingers, like a
cork. Not a twinge of pain or even irritation
is felt when using Frozol-Ice, or afterwards.
No soreness, no inflammation of surrounding
healthy flesh or skin.
Only a few pence now gives one freedom
from all and each soft corn, hard corn, corn
between the toes, likewise tender callouses on
bottom of the feet. Every Australian who
tries Frozol-Ice sings its praises, for it
honestly does not hurt one wee bit.
Step in at your chemist’s to-night and in-
sist on having a small phial of Frozol-Ice,
in the green-printed carton. Stand on
dig.” and refuse spurious imitations of this
great compound.
Easy Way to Get
Rid of Indigestion.
Although you may have indigestion so
severely that anything but the simplest of
foods cause you the keenest suffering, there
is a simple way to get back safely to pleas-
anter, more nourishing foods. Just take a
teaspoonful of pure Salix Magnesia in a little
hot or cold watei 1 with eacn meal, and begin
at once to eat a little of any food you crave.
Salix Magnesia, which comes in the form ot
powder or tablets (never as a liquid or coarse
granules) is not a laxative, but neutralises
the excess acid in the stomach, and so prevents
or stops all the pain of indigestion. Its use
cannot, like pepsin, soda-water, etc., do the
stomach any injury, and it will soon enable
you to eat good, hearty, satisfying meals of
the foods you like best without fear of bad
results. Your chemist should be able to sup-
ply you with Salix Magnesia.

“E.T.”: “Tilly of Bloomsbury,” just
now giving Australian playgoers a good
laugh, has had a new scene added to it in
London, where it has been running for a
twelvemonth. The introduced dialogue
brings back the comic curate in. the last
act, which part is being played here by the
reliable Jimmy Atholwood. In Fogtowm the
character is taken by Lawrence Hanray, a
modest mummer who did some good work
years ago in Australia as a member of the
“Are You a Mason?” co., with George -Gul-
dens as the star.
“F.”: Having seen the efforts of Lucas,
the American, imported at a big salary to
produce Australian photoplays, I’m quite
convinced that the future of the business
this end of the world lies with the local
lads. Longford has already turned out two
successes in “The Sentimental Bloke” and
“Ginger Mick,” which were excellent tech-
nical achievements and big money-spinners.
Frank Barrett has reached a fair standard
in “The Breaking of the Drought,” and one
or two other local efforts now being assembled

show a big improvement over previous
tries. Every Australian producer has
had to keep his eye on costs all the time.
Lucas had a free run, and the indulgent
Carrolls didn’t question his expenditure—
which ran into a huge figure as local esti-
mates go. Last year Charles Villiers turned
out “The Face at the Window,” six reels
of blood and blue-murder, for £5OO, and
gave a big section of picture-patrons more
enjoyment than the £lOO,OOO productions
from Yankeeland ever offered. For the
time, at any rate, Australian movie-makers
should be exhorted to continue keeping the
exes, down so that the backers of the local
industry may be encouraged to more liber-
ality when they see that Australian exhibi-
tion alone returns the cost of the picture
and a comfortable margin. It is useless to
look on America as a new or permanent
field for Australian stuff. The Yanks are
already upset over the competition their
films are meeting with overseas from the im-
proved post-war offerings of English and
Continental companies, and producers con-
trolled by N’York financiers aren’t inclined
to pay the maternity expenses for a kid
that might grow husky enough to blacken
its old man’s eye. There’s plenty of room
for Australia in Europe, provided Australia
expresses itself in quick action and solid
drama without umpteen reels of agony that
have nothing to do with the show.* And
it’s the agony that costs the cash.
“S.T.S.”: Why the superstition among
professional actors that the author’s words
must not be changed, even when altered con-
ditions make them absurd? Amateurs are
notoriously otherwise, forever suggesting
“Doesn’t that sound inconsistent?” and
“Hadn’t I better
say so-and-so?”
till a worried pro-
ducer begs them to
“give the author a

secutive evenings I

ance of his hostess,

logue is taken

that the original

be in all these cases a lack of intelligence to
notice what the audience notices every time;
so a superstition it must be.
“Old Pot”: Greenaway and Atholwood,
two of Australian’s soundest actors, were
pupils of Hoskins, and they speak
admiringly of the old man’s methods.
Henry Irving’s frank admission that he
owed his start to Hoskins was what
you would expect of one from whom
Melba might have taken pattern in
regard to her Melbourne teacher Cecci. When
it Avas in her power to give the old Italian
a lift, she forgot. Her biographer, Miss
Murpby, gives the Melba explanation in
her work, but it hasn’t the right ring. Green-
away went to England and supported Rich-
ard Mansfield, the rejected of the English
theatre who became the corner-stone of the
American stage. Atholwood remained in
Australia, to the artistic gain of his native
land, but to his own financial loss.
“How divinely she wobbles!” said the
amiable idiot of an adipose songstress who
was making a recent concert appearance in
Sydney.
Sydney scenic artist J. W. McMillan went
west last week. He studied under the late
Mr. Vaughan and W. .T. Wilson, joined
Clarke and Meynell at Melbourne, and re-
mained with them all through their career,
working in conjunction with Phil Goatcher.
Later he was with George Marlow, under
Jack Mann as chief artist. He was but
36 when the sun went down.
“0.K.”: Margaret Swallow, the pretty
little widow in “The Man from Toronto,”
must be ambidextrous. She tickles her
guardian’s neck with her right, and she
dashes off a note to herself with her left.
Perhaps the feat is intended to imply
that the English race can make some sort
of show against the superior virility of the
Canadian. In all questions of comparison
between the natives of the Old World and a
new one, British comedy disparages British
physique. In this play a young Canadian
girl, who slaps her chest and upbraids her-
self for being a bit out of condition, is sup-
posed to have outrun an active university
boy, to whom she can give points at any
other game he likes to mention. And the
Man from Canada! He talks of his great
life, his great hopes, and his great health
as though he were an American just back
from winning the war. Moreover, be has
lived so close to God under the starry sky
that he doesn’t know Canadians in cities
wear creases down their trousers same as
English townsfolk. He thinks of creased
pants as a purely-English custom, and his
hostess, disguised as a parlormaid, is too
polite to ask him what he’s giving her.
“Fax”: If there ever was a doubt about
Melba being as great a Princess of Adver-
tising as she is a Queen of Song it was
settled when she hit on the device of sing-
ing, by wireless telephone, to an alleged
world-audience, said to have been gathered
“within a radius of 1000 miles.” The most
sensational robberies of divas’ diamonds are
dwarfed into insignificance by this sound-
waves concert, concluding with “God Save
the King”—by special desire. The special
desire was her own, seemingly. The 1000-
mile audience heard her cry “I must sing
‘God Save the King’!” And she did. Melba’s
almighty must brooks no denial.
“Fan”: “The Breaking of the Drought,”
filmed by the Golden Wattle Syndicate, was
abruptly shifted from Sydney Lyceum to the
Grand last week. The promoters were keen
on getting the film-adaptation shown in the
theatre which housed Bland Holt when his
remarkable money-spinner was first staged
in Sydney. But the Lyceum, which is con-
trolled by the Methodists, keeps a censor
on the premises to shoo off anything which
might bring the blush to the cheeks of the
next-door Tattersall’s Club, and having seen
the film of “The Breaking” on Tuesday he
ruled it out. He was asked to indicate the
offending portions. Thereupon he had a
second view of the naughtiness—some
admirable dancing at the Hurricane Club —
and ordered the excision of about a quarter
of the picture. This was declined without
thanks, and the show was banished to the
Grand. Yet there are memories of some
other films at the Lyceum !
“O. Blin”: Cecil Brooking, who appears
as the artless Gussie in “The Little Damo-
zel,” was once a member of an English co.
that played Shakspeare in Berlin and re-
ceived some heavy punishment from the
critics. The actors, of course, couldn’t
answer their press tradueers, but when the
criticism extended to their favorite caffs and
assaulted their ears with personalities
thrown in, the ordinarily complacent mum-
mers got a bit restive. The climax came
one evening when a Hun, after a flow of
ponderous insults, loudly proclaimed Shaks-
peare a German institution. This was too
much for Brooking’s partner. He went over
to the patriot’s table and in his best Prus-
sian said: “How can you call Shakspeare
German? He doesn’t mention sausage any-
where.”
“J.F.H.” (London) : Morris Gest, of New
York, recently crossed the pond to consult
with Oscar Asche regarding the American
production of “Mecca.” Morris is the man
who introduced Oscar’s “Chu Chin Chow”
to American audiences. In New York it
has been running for a year, and there
are half a dozen cos. on tour; one of them
numbers 275 members, and at Chicago raked
in .$50,000 in a week. “Chu Chin Chow”
has passed its 1700th milestone in London.
“Mecca” has long been ready to replace
it, but as “Chu” is still in the boom Asche
is giving New York the 'privilege of
sampling it.
“S.S.”: What would Europe do with a
young fiddler like Cecil Parkes of Mel-
bourne? The youngster has genius, not in
small doses, but in a mass. As a mere
kid he handles the violin with the confidence
and mastery of a veteran. He has passed
the prodigy stage, and now as a youth of
15 is Melbourne’s favorite fiddler. But
favor in Melbourne does not amount to
much. Australia only raves oYer the im-
ported item. Parkes has all that is neces-
sary in a young lion except the community
willing to lionise. He would certainly find
it in Europe, perhaps in America.
“C. Ockney”: Madge Titheradge, back
in England after a strenuous season in
American movie studios, declares that she is
“fed up with filming,” having “taken a
dislike to putting on an evening-dress at
8 o’clock in the morning and appearing with
a painted face in the sunshine.” Madge
therefore reappears at Drury Lane shortly
as the heroine of Hichens’s “Garden of
Allah.”
“Bardi”: Frederick Esmelton, one of
“The Three Wise Fools” and producer of
the same, is an Australian, too. In MeL
bourne they used to call him Fred Bryant,
and he is a brother of Mrs. Horatio Webb,
treasurer of the Austral Salon for many
years. Esmelton got his first start in a
Maggie Moore co. when Maggie wasn’t
quite so substantial as she is now. He has
done considerable picture-acting in the
U.S.A.
“Norbell” : In his published diary George
Rignold calls himself George Richard Rig-
nold, but I remember him showing me an
agreement made with George R. Sims, con-
cerning “The Lights o’ London,” in which
he was mentioned as “George Bignall, known
as George Rignold.”
“Three Wise
Fools,” at
Sydney
Criterion.
Sydney Stirling
as Dr.
Richard Qaunt.
“Old Pot”: Regarding actors and their
whiskers, Rignold’s upper lip was adorned
with, the “butterfly,” as opposed to
the toothbrush affected by British subs
and Charlfe Chaplin. Nothing more like
a winged insect could be imagined
than the beauty spot that “Handi-
some George” wore under his nose. He
had a clean-cut n*outh, and the idea was t<>
display this feature. It tickled the fancy of
one of his supers in “Called Back,” and,
dared by his mates, he went so far as to
imitate it in crgpe hair. When Rignold
saw it he scowled darkly and, sending for
the supermaster, asked what the devil it
meant.. But though he at first stormed he
withdrew his hastily-uttered order of the
sack.
“Norbell”: “Old Pot” says (B. 10/6/’2O)
“Perhaps the worst Hamlet Australia has
seen was George Titheradge, and I still
think Alfred Dumpier was the best.” Did
“Old Pot” endure H. B. Irving when he
lugubriously whined the part here? But I
cordially agree that Alfred Dampier was
our best Hamlet. I was his Horatio many
times, and know how the enthusiastic old
boy let himself go. “God, laddie, isn’t it
great stuff!” he used to say. Once he was
doing the moody one in the Towers (N.Q.)
when a callow youth who was jerking Ber-
nardo took fright at the ghost, or some-
thing, in Act 1 and faded away, leaving
Marcellus to speak his lines. When the
act was over Bernardo was found in hi?
dressing-room, feverishly polling his pants
on over his tights preparatory to streaking
for home. Dampier simply fell on him. “My
boy,” he wailed, “I wouldn’t mind you doing
a thing like that in ‘East Lynne,’ but
Elsinore is sacred! Go back to the stage at
once!” Then he quoted vigorously:—
“ ‘For though I am not splenetive and rash,
Yet have I in me something dangerous,
Which let thy wisdom fear!’
Not that you have any wisdom,” he added
bitterly.
“Old Pot”: Osmonde Tearle, whose sons
Godfrey ahd Malcolm have appeared in Aus-
tralia, is one of the few actors that have
declined to dress Othello as a barbarian.
Arthur Greenaway was lago to Tearle in
the Coldland, and he recalls that the Moor
was garbed; as a Venetian gentleman when
not in the military uniform of the period.
I recollect Tearle in the character, and his
adherence to the text in the matter of inter-
pretation as well as habit is fresh in my
memory, although more than three decades
have passed. Oscar Asche modelled his Moor
on that of Salvini, the Italian, whose pas-
sions were whirlwinds and with whom, be-
cause of that, lagos did not care to act.
The Australian actor emphasised the bar-
baric side of the character, but his voice
lacked music and could not express the ten-
derness of the pre-murder speeches. The
very qualities which made him a success in
“Kismet” as Haj the Beggar caused him to
miss the ’bus in Othello.
C. J. De Garis has issued. the marching
orders for his cryptically-named comic opera,
“F.F.F.,” which is understood to have been
acquired by Hugh Mclntosh. The piece
opens at Adelaide on the 24th inst., and
after a short run in Perth it will rush
east to Melbourne and Sydney.
DISILLUSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m of a questionable race,
A simple chorus-girl;
I pad my legs and paint my face
And put my hair in curl;
I dance a little, and I sing....
My chief use, truth to tell,
Is just to wear scarce anything—■
I do it very well.
A disappointed wretch am I!
When my first bid I made
On each hand rose the warning cry,
And I was sore afraid.
The told me of temptations dread,
Insidious snares complete
That rich and wicked men would spread
To trap my youthful feet.
They said that roues bojd would bring
Their diamonds and pearls,
That bad old fellows often fling
Large emeralds at girls
Who show upon the public stage
In frivolous array.
I’m close on thirty years of age,
And none have come my way.
Ten years I’ve been a chorister,
And gained no splendid blooms.
No suppers ever for me were
Spread in luxurious r00m5....
I am to wed a working muff,
For now I’ve come to see
The rich are never bad enough
To be much good to me.
VICTORIA.

YOU can have the Knowledge of all the Ages
Ever since the art of writing language was
evolved, man has steadily progressed in
knowledge and with the increased know-
ledge has come increased pleasure. You
can add to your pleasure if you will by
knowing and reading good books. Books
that are worth while.
The Romans had a saying, “Litera scripta
manet.” “That which is written remaineth.”
It is by the written word —Books—that the
human race has been able to accumulate
knowledge and enjoyment.
We have a saying, “Good books make
good men better”—and how true it is!
You, by reading, can gain the knowledge
and experience.
Is it not worth your while to get this extra
enjoyment out of life? It costs you so little
to gather your library together, and when
done in the Standard way that little can be
spread over a long period—you can pay
as you enjoy. Perhaps, too, you could
get your own library and pay for it by sell-
ing some editions to your friends; we would
give you generous commission on any sales
you made. Write and ask about this
proposition.
HISTORY TELLING ITSELF.
It has been said that the true difference between mankind and the brute
creation is the gift of speech. This is but half-truth, for how could we be “the
heirs of all ages” were it not for the perpetuation of race-memory by means of
WRITTEN Speech—by means of BOOKS?
Hence it is the duty—the unquestionable duty—of every civilised man and
woman to collect and to use a library ; not necessarily an expensive and exhaustive
library such as the privileged few alone may possess; but a little collection of
books such as are vital to the mental, spiritual and cultural well-being of their
possessor.
The question arises: Which are the books vital to such well-being?
Surely History must come first, for only in the light of history can the
riddle of to-day’s world be read.
There is one presentation of the world’s history which is more thrilling
than any tale of adventure, more absorbing than any novel.
This monumental work is simply and truly entitled “THE WORLD’S
STORY,” and it is in no sense the convential work of historical references. Its
sub-title, “A History of the World in Story, Song and Art,” conveys some idea of
the ideals which animated the men who compiled it.
It is HISTORY TELLING ITSELF, in its own language. Far back as
written records exist, these wonderful volumes show you history unrolling itself
AS IT APPEARED TO THOSE WHO WERE LIVING IT.
The world’s slowly evolving thought is shown in extracts from the great
• thinkers of all ages, from Homer and Plato to Tolstoi and Carlyle. The world’s
magnificent deeds are recorded in vivid pictures —pen pictures and brush pictures
—from Zenopkon to Captain Scott.
There is at once a contrast and a wonderful similarity between the exploits
of the former and the latter. Right down the ringing ages comes the glad cry
“Thallatta ! Thallatta!” While scarcely yet in its proper perspective on the gigantic
canvas stands that infinitely heroic scene of one dying man stumbling out in the
snow that he might relieve his comrades of a dead weight. “I’m going outside for
a little while, you chaps!” said Captain Oates, “I shan’t be long.” Not long—
dying!
How many heroic, how many pathetic, how many joyful scenes lie between
those two? . T _.
In so far as Life is Art and Art is Life, in just that measure is History at
once the story of Art and Life.
And here, in “The World’s Story,” we have history in prose, in poetry, in
painting—history that can be seen and heard and felt; history to which one must
thrill as no mere imaginative story can have power of thrilling us!
Fourteen volumes of vivid life! Fourteen volumes of vibrant Art! Fourteen
volumes which are in themselves such a treasure-vault of inspiration, of education,
of stimulation, of cultural value as may justly lay claim to the title of a library in
itself.
What do YOU know of the magnificent epic of human story?
Will you not know more? Surely, SURELY, the fascination of these
volumes is irresistible to any civilised being?

now —TO-DAY! These wonderful books, 14 volumes, cost only £lO 10s. on terms.

Two Great French Novelists.
BALZAC.
Balzac, of all writers of fiction, may most truly be said to have “held the
mirror up to nature.” His characters, his scenes, his portrayal of passion and its
effects are all of them characterised by the same wonderful fidelity to life.
There are those who have levelled against him a charge of coarseness. . The
charge may perhaps lie if it can be proven that Life and Nature are exquisitely
free from any such taint. Every truly great mind might be similarly indicted,
because the greater the creating mind the more closely its creations resemble
Nature. Shakspeare was not always careful of the ears of his audience; yet
which is the greater name, Bowdler or Shakspeare?
Let us not be petty. Balzac had the genius to see Life as it is: the temerity
to record faithfully that which he .saw.
The edition of Balzac which we offer you is as complete as any that has yet
been published in English. It comprises fourteen volumes, handsomely bound in
green and gold. The illustrations are particularly notable. They are by many
of the foremost French artists, and the frontispieces are etchings from copper
plates. When it is mentioned that the originals were exhibited in the Salon, it
will be realised that they are not of the ordinary. Price Six Guineas. Fifty-
three volumes for £25 —a lifetime’s interest for a few shillings a month.
DE MAUPASSANT.
Truly French, yet universal, is De Maupassant. Every educated man and
woman has read his wonderful stories, and most people of literary taste own his
complete works. Do You? If not, you are missing some of the very finest literature
the world knows, and you need not miss it on account of cost, because the Edition
we offer on the Standard way brings it within the reach of everyone’s purse.
This edition is complete and unexpurgated, it is a perfect translation of what
De Maupassant wrote —perfectly printed and bound. It will give you endless
pleasure. There are only a very few sets, so you had better send for yours now,
before they are all sold. £l2/12/- for the complete set of 17 volumes.
Send the coupon for either or both of these Sets of the greatest of France’s
novelists.
Your Children’s Musical Education.

aid of this marvellously-compiled work, “The Musical Educator.” This set of
books has been compiled by the world’s great musicians and music-teachers. It
instructs in every branch of music, and its instruction is clear, simple and concise,

The Prince of Wales had his double in
Melbourne—a fair youth in the leather trade. This
bright boy accented the resemblance by decking
lnmself on the royal lines, with the result that
when he presented himself to a bookie under the
elms the gentle Hebrew lost his nut. and, asked
the price of a certain neddy, stammered: “Twenty-
fives to von to you, yer Majesty, tens to anybody
elth.” The horse won, and by the time the fair
deceiver went to collect grave doubts had arisen in
the mind of the noble soul behind the bag, and he
whispered darkly, when paying out the long price:
‘Thee here, my lad, if I voth kvite thertain you
vos nod goinlc to be king of England, I’d pass you
von, so ’elp me I vould.” /
* * * *
Except Bright Plume (9st. 131 b.) all the
early-fancied ones for the Grand National Hurdle are
weighted at from 10 to 11 stone. It happened last
year that the placed horses carried lOst. 81b,, lOst.
81b., and lOst., but in the last 20 years the winner
has mostly been among the under-10-stoners. Nine
of them, in fact, have carried not more than 9st.
71b. This year’s handicaps are flattering to the
higher weights, in so far that the highest is list.
01b., or only 341 b. above the minimum; neverthe-
less, there is the same old chance for one of the
minimummers to reveal winning form before the
day, or run away with the race unexpectedly, as
Rathfarnham and Narahquong did in their years.
Anyhow, the law of averages indicates that the
winner will probably have under lOst. on his back,
and nothing seems more likely than Bright Plume.
The gelding is very good looking, and is compara-
tively youthful, and has been- learning his business
under Cairns, who will, all going well, have the
mount. For probably the first time on record three
previous winners are entered for the big race—
Rathfarnham, Narahquong and Will Comfort, who
did the trick last year. Eleven-six may not keep
"iH Comfort out of a place, if that rather delicate
animal be thoroughly wound up for his annual out-
ing. But the other two previous-winners are prac-
tically condemned by being thrown into the handi-
cap. Rathfarnham, who dates back to 1915 in
the record, has had but .that one good day in his
life, and Narahquong is a stallion whose recent
f°rm suggests that jumping hurdles is no longer
his hobby.
* * * *
Coronatus must be the oldest of hurdlers
entered for the National. It seems ages since he
used to be always among the top weights, and it
is three years since he surprised everybody but his
immediate friends by running second to Polygamist
in the Australian Hurdle, under the luxurious burden
of lOst. 131 b. His handicap in this year’s G.N. is
9st 81b., which is 31b. less than the allotment to
Nick-a-Jack, who is also an ancient.
* * * *
At Williamstown last Saturday there was
a further combing out of form for the Nationals.
Oopina, who beat a less exacting field at Flemington
three weeks earlier, won the Port Phillip Hurdle
from Mabu, Beltane, Suma, Pistolier and Merry Bob.
On this showing, apart from his previous doings,
Oopina looks likely to finish ahead of Mabu next
Saturday, and if Mabu is “bound to be in the first
half-dozen” there can’t be much room left (on
paper) for Oopina’s defeat. Bright Plume, however,
ought to be one too good for the son of Pistol, if
nothing else is.
■ *
Mountain God’s capture of the steeplechase at Wil-
liamstown was quite in accordance with popular
omnion of the deity’s chance in the National Steeple.
The big fellow seems to have been slowly and care-
prepared for the big race, but he’s no cert.
Nothing 1 is a cert* —except accidents.
“0.K.”: Surely Fred Burn’s Vanitor
must have a capital chance in the G. N. Steeple
He will carry the same weight (lOst. 61b.) as when
he ran second to Timipman (9st. 31b.) in the
Victoria Steeple at Flemington on the last day of
Melbourne Cup meeting. This was the fastest
three miles one furlong steeplechase ever run in
Victoria, and 7).sec. faster than Old Mun-
gindi’s time for the National, which was a record.
The pace alone beat Vanitor, who finished lengths
ahead of old Compromise. He had won the steeple
on Cup day, and Fred Burn reckoned his horse
certain to do likewise over the longer distance, but
Tirrupman (since dead) was too fast. The pace
then was over the odds, and the journey on Satur-
day week will be much more to Vanitor’s liking.
He is only seven years old, nor has he been knocked
about at the game. A year ago he won the
Maiden Steeple at the National meeting, but in the
National a week later he had the bad luck to fall.
After which nothing was thought of Vanitor until
his two outings at the Melbourne Cup meeting.
The main feature of the Epsom and
Metrop. handicaps is the uneven class of nag the
weight-fixer had to “bring together” by avoirdupois..
Starting with Wolaroi at 9st. 131 b. in the Mile, only
29 out of 192 are reckoned to be within 2st. of him,
and 137 are considered unworthy of more than 7st.
71b. More than half stand at 7st. and under. The
Metrop. 150 start with Poitrel lOst. 21b. and Kenna-
quhair lOst. Then follow 22 in the 9st. and Bst.
divisions, and the rest peter away down to the mini-
mum—lll of them below 7st. 71b. Something of
this sort happens in varying degree, of course, every
year, multitudinous prads being nominated that
haven’t a hope in life of getting to the post.
’ * * * .
In the Epsom Chrysolaus (9st: 61b.) looks
as good as any of the heavier-weighted lot. He is an
exceptionally brilliant galloper-—but Epsom winners
rarely have over 9st. on top. To be explicit, it
has happened twice in 20 years. On arithmetic the
best-treated of the lot is perhaps the Mimer gelding
Palmitic (6st. 101 b. i. He won over six furlongs in
good company at Canterbury Park last month, and
the other day ran third in the A.J.C. June Stakes
with 7st. 51b. And several that then finished behind
him are here set to meet him on conspicuously worse
terms. The last Rosehill Guineas winner Elfacre
catches the eye as a long-distance possibility, with
Bst. 121 b. He lives in the same stable as Panacre.
Dunloch, a useful Montecello colt rising four, from
an imported mare, may come into notice. He has
7st. 51b. With Bst. 131 b. and inartistic handling he
was third in the Renfrew Plate, a mile, at Randwick
the other day.
* * » •
The extension of the Metrop. to a mile
and five furlongs will probably limit the size of
the field and secure to those that do start a better
trip. Red Cardinal Bst. 21b. and Ard-na-ree appear
in the picture, and Silverton, winner of the Winter
Stakes and dead-heater for the Prince of Wales
Cup, is distinctly obtrusive. The Metrop. is a
hard race to win, but this St. Alwyne gelding is
a good horse and should be better in the' spring.
* * * *
Troy town, England’s greatest steeple-
chaser, broke his leg at Auteiul—the great jump-
ing course near Paris—last week, after narrowly
escaping being burnt to death on the railway journey
from the French coast. Being a gelding he was
destroyed. One of the Beresfords owned a horse
years ago that won a lot of money after being
added to the list; and then he broke his leg above
the hock. A vet. was commissioned to look after
the animal, and he finished his life at grass. But,
then, there has always been a strain of insanity
in the Beresfords.

Australia defeated the English Northern.
Union team on Saturday at Brisbane by eight points
(two tries one goal) to four points (2 goals). It
was the first of the Tests. The Woodbines fielded
their best 13, whilst Australia lacked Junker Robin-
son and Smacker Blair. They were forwarded from
Sydney late on Thursday night per motor, but failed
to arrive in time for the argument. Wagstaffe
(accompanied by a bulldog) led the tourists into
action, and things hummed from the boot-off. Both
sides tackled like tigers: there was much stoush, and
the cossacks were rarely off the shin. The referee
stood it; his attitude being that professional football
is not croquet. England prevailed in the first
spell, registering four points (two penalty goals by
champion booter Ben Gronow) to Australia’s three
points (one try by Chook Fraser). The Kangaroos
then bogged in to great purpose, Sandy Pearce,
Ohunky Burge and Co. obtaining the ball in nearly
every scrum. The home forwards completely over-
shadowed the visiting
six, and in view of
this the Australians
closed up the game.
The Englishmen fought
(in every sense) to the
last ditch, but were
outclassed. Chunky
Burge’s try, which
Horder converted, put
the kibosh on the af-
fair, and when little
Laurie Kearney blew
the “no side’’ blast,
Australia led as above
mentioned. Pre w i n
and Broadfoot, o f
Queensland, well justi-
fied their inclusion.

Saturday.
The eighth round of Sydney Eugby
League competition was decided on Saturday, Sydney
v. Glebe being most fancied by the experts. 'Both
teams were equal on points, and with Burge out of
the Glebe pack the Rabbitos reckoned they could
just about win. They didn’t, though they played
the better football. Their trouble was the lack of
a goaler; Glebe recorded 17 points (three tries
four goals) to 14 points (four tries one goal).
Glebe owe their victory to Dolly Gray’s unerring
toe and the cleverness of their forwards. Hallett,
the veteran South full-back, although starting ner-
vously, finished up better than Proctor of Glebe.
South’s threes were superior to the Dirty Reds"’
and brought off some pretty movements. Tiger Gilles-
pie and Boxhead Horder being very sound. Gordon
Vaughan, South’s winger (who wasn’t originally
selected), brought off a great stunt: he grabbed the
leather just outside his own 25, and shaking off the
Reds booted over full-back Proctor’s head and scored.
Benson, Glebe’s scrum-half, was always in evidence.
Not so Fritz Theiring at stand-off half: he should
be in the forwards line. Mick Scannell was Glebe’s
best back, his tackling being’ deadly. The other
games resulted as expected. Easts, without Sandy
Pearce, Bluey Watkins and Rex Norman, were
hotly pressed by North Sydney, whom they defeated
by 12 points to 8 points. Wally Messenger notched
9 for the Watersiders. Wests were at home to
’Varsity at Ashfleld. They took block, and hit up
52 points to the Students’ 15. Tancred, who visited
Australia with the last M.L. League team, made a
promising debut with Wests. Newtown, administered
the usual weekly lathering to Annandale. The
scores were 15 to 6. 'Balmain (still in front with
15 competition points) had the bye.
* * * *
The ninth round of Sydney Rugby Union
tourney produced two surprises—Mosman’s defeat of
Wests, and Easts of Glebe-Balmain. Easts have
been training assiduously, and their five-point win
over Glebe-Balmain was well deserved. Flook col-
lected three brilliant tries for the winners. Mayne,
of G.-8., was most unselfish ; and Buchanan worked
hard; but the brothers Friend were the pick of
the pack. Newtown put it about that they ex-
pected to beat ’Varsity. They were counting on
the scholars’ custom of, spelling their stars when
opposed to a weak team. Uni. were taking no risks,
however, and had their clock-like quarter-line on
the go, 39 points being compiled to nil. Farquhar
crossed lour times and Oxenham three. Wests should
never have gone down to Mosman, though the Nor-
therners have a hefty lot of forwards. Wogan, for
Wests, was patchy, hut Fetherstone and Shute were
sound. Fetherstone must get his chance in the big
matches ahead. Wests looked like snatching a win
when the whistle blew. Manly had Norths’ tongues
out after the first half, 17 points dividing them at
the end. Mailey’s offside play was a feature of
the match. His size, or want of it, enables him
to escape the referee’s notice. *The giamc was fairly
fast and open, but Norths’ team was chiefly com-
posed of new players and their want of condition
in the early stages spoilt whatever chance they had.
P.vm, Chambers and the two Smiths were the
\ dlagers’ try-getters, and Burrows scored Norths’
spectacular try. v

football in Melbourne was
prime, despite the weather. The improving ’Dons,
coached by the old ’Roy battler, Johnny Worrall,
met the undefeated Richmond tigers and, in an
exceptionally swift game, carried all before them
up to three-quarter time. They then had a lead
of six goals. Whereupon the yellow-and-blacks
pulled themselves together and added 55 points
in that last term, more than doubling their pre-
vious tally. ’Dons failed to add another point—■
and so went down by 75 to 95. ’Wood and South
put up dn exciting scrimmage on South’s ground.
’Wood, the better team on the day, won by 07
to 63. Melbourne, who seem to have lost their
dash or block or something, came down wallop at
Geelong, the Seasiders gaining their first win this
season by 113 points to 48. Geelong owed' a lot
of their success to Basil Collins, the alleged “strike-
breaker,” who was heartily cheered bv the big
crowd and gave the best he had in the box in
return. St. Kilda started on the long track that
leads to success by playing four new men against
Roy, and though the result—2B points to ’Roy’s
102—was depressing, it was no worse than many
of their earlier efforts this season.
. In J hs Ass. game FootsCrav got their first lick-
ing this season, at Northcote. Like the League
leaders Richmond—they were badly astern at the
last change of ends, and though thereafter they
strove vahantiy to score and—like Richmond-
kept their opponents from doing so, they didn’t
kick straight enough. Result, defeat by one measly
point 44 to ’Cote’s 45. ’Scray, Port, North and
Brunswick, now lead in the Ass., and it doesn’t
look as. though any team can push them out of the
nngi lour.

A finer match than that between Joe
Symonds and Jack Green at Sydney Stadium on
n-u u^r a *r mght kas rarely been staged in Australia,
lhe Sydney youngster fought as well as he did when .
the pair met the week before last; and Joseph did
a lot better. Both are champions in their class, and
game, and able to eat punishment and come back avid
tor more. Symonds was 4lb. heavier, and at the
outset, a lot stronger (he is a man, whereas Green
is still in his teens) ; his opponent was a shade faster,
and in slightly better nick. Symonds went awav
with a rush in the opening rounds and piled up a
useful margin of points, though in no one clash
was Green far behind. Then the Australian started
and the encouraging chant of his supporters rose
to a yell. Green was making Symonds miss very
crudely indeed, when, in the 11th session, he
stopped one on the ear that steadied him. But he
certainly dominated the situation in the last five
rounds, so that the verdict of referee Wallis in
favor of the visitor was regarded by a section of the
crowd as an outrage. The people who protest at
the finish of a 20-round fight have rarely bothered
to estimate the first half-dozen rounds whereas the
referee has. In fact,, many don’t trouble much about
the first minute or so of any one round, which was
why Harry Stone got such credit from the populace
for his whirlwind efforts in the final seconds of
everv three mi mites he fought. Symonds no doubt
held the balance m the total number of points regis-
tered. Yet it was a close thing. b
What the public now looks for is a match between
Jimmy HiL and Green, or between Sid Godfrey and
Symonds. Godfrey’s terrific right-hand wallop,
before which the most expensive of imported cham-
pions is liable to collapse, constitutes an objection to
him in the eyes of the Stadium authorities. “Why,”
they argue, “put a popular draw into the ring to
have his fair fame destroyed within a couple of
rounds or less?” But no such contention applies to
Hill, who could box all night and not “out” the
possessor of a normal jaw, and whose ring-artistry is
unquestioned.
H.C.L. forced the English Cup final
(Soccer) into two records. It was estimated at
about the smallest attendance for the past 20
years (only 50,000), but increased charges brought
an unheard-of “gate” (close on £10,000). This,
works out at nearly four bob a head; but there
are thousands of reserved seats at theatre prices.
As cabled, Aston Villa (Birmingham) won from
Huddersfield by a soli-
tary goal’: there was
no scoring at all in
the 90 minutes of the
match proper, and
another half-hour was
given to get a decision.
It is Aston Villa’s
sixth Cup win—another
record.
“DICK” LEE, of
Collingwood (Vic.
League Football),
the champion goal-
kicker. In the inter-
state match be-
tween Vic. and
South Aus. at Mel-
bourne, on August
2, he kicked six
goals. In Coiling-
wood's training
quarters there is a
piece of furniture
made to com-
memorate his five
hundredth goal. He
was the first Vic.
League player to
perform that feat.
In answer to The Bulletin’s suggestion
that he might have met and beaten Barry by enlist-
ing, as Felton did, Jim Paddon has this to say:
“My brother went (and was killed), and owing to
his absence the whole work of looking after our
oyster leases and accommodation house and my
family of five children (the eldest being 10) devolved
on me. I solidly supported conscription and put
all I had to spare into War Loans.” It is a good
defence as regards the writer’s patriotism. But it
is no argument in support of his claim that Barry
should give him preferential treatment over Felton.
The ex-soldiers created the sculling boom and have
a sporting right to the fruits of it.
* * * *
Some of N. S. Wales’s best appeared in
the outrigger handicap at Como on Saturday. E. West
(30see.) won from Billy MoDevitt (scratch) and
Milton Kent (13sec.). West is a 6ft. lin. novice
who scales 13st. 71b. McDevitt, who was beaten
by three lengths, claims to be well advanced for
his coming N. S. Wales championship match with
Billy Ripley.
* * * *
Ernest Barry is in poor health, and for
the last three : weeks has scarcely touched an oar.
If the doctors won’t let him get going this week
he will have to call off the big match with Felton.
* * * *
One morning last week H.R.H. rode at
Randwiek, and his exhibition of horsemanship pleased
a small crowd of discriminating critics, including
veteran trainer Joe Burton. But the young man’s
naval chaperon reproved those responsible for the
selection of two-year-olds as princely mounts. The
youngsters were perfectly quiet, but Halsey, thought
they were dangerous and said so, to the uncon-
cealed vexation of his pink-cheeked protege, who
came along before the argument had exhausted itself.
“Anyone would think a man was a blanlcy mug!”
commented the heir-apparent, bitterly.
* * * *
Kingscote, Parke, Mavrogordato and
Roper Barrett will represent Britain in the approach-
ing heats for the Davis Cup. The team is greatly
strengthened by the inclusion of Parke, who, at his
best, is something of a phenomenon, his accurate
shooting to base and side lines often paralysing the
most resourceful opponent. Mavrogordato, another
Singles player, has been selected in place of Max
Woosnam, who was previously favored, but h<»
hardly ranks with Parke and Kingscote, or with
the U.S. and French cracks and Gerald Patterson.
Barrett will be Kingscote’s accomplice in the Doubles.
He has been appearing in front-rank tennis for over
20 years, and has probably been chosen because he
is the_ best English exponent of the lively net play
in which the Yanks and Australians specialise.
“15-30” c Tilden, who decisively, walloped
Parke after Parke had beaten Tilden’s countryman
Johnston in the tennis championships at Wimble-
don the other day, is regarded by Norman Brookes
as the finest stroke-player in the world. The variety
and perfection of his shots greatly impressed Nor-
man in a match in which he lost to the American
in the U.S. last. year. Tilden’s disconcerting
accuracy, however, is unbalanced by a nervous tem-
perament, and he has twice just missed the U.S.
championship through over-anxiety at a critical
stage. That he is a great performer when stirred
up by an initial success is shown by his figures
against Parke (6—2, 6 —3, 6—4), a licking which
Parke had never previously experienced.. Tilden is
Johnston’s colleague in Uncle Sam’s team for the
Davis Cup, and if both retain their form they are
pretty certain to face Australia in the final.
* * * *
The “Indianapolis 500,” which was re-
sumed last year after being abandoned in 1917 and
1918, has been won this time by Gaston Chevrolet,
who, according to the cable, averaged 91 miles per
hour. If this is. true Chevrolet has whittled a
minute or two off de Palma’s record of shr. 33min.
55sec. De Palma was leading near the finish of this
year’s whiz; but Chevrolet caught him up and
after a great struggle left him astern.
THE MORAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Meeting to-day my lady fair,
Her dimpled cheeks aglow,
Quoth I: “The saucy hat you wear
Would have the world to know
Your fancy for the Hurdle Race,
I venture to presume?”
A passing blush adorned her face
As, curtseying with winning grace,
She said: “You’ve guessed—Bright Plume.”
The feather in her hat was red;
Red salve was on her lip ;
The red rose on her bosom shed
Sweet perfume of the tip;
Her flashing eyes diffused a light—
Such lights this world illume—
When, pinching my forefinger tight,
She said: “Old dear, it’s quite all right;
You’ve got to back Bright Plume.”
How many girls I used to meet—
Young kittens, aye, and cats—
Whom once again I’d love to greet,
Had feathers in their hats!
Hejgho! for better or for worse,'
Till worms my flesh consume,
Whilst I’ve a shilling jq my purse,
And still the wit to write a verse,
I’ve got to back Bright Plume.
VICTORIA.

.That pattern of propriety, Philip Fysh,
who helped to make political history in the
bpeck and was his State’s leader in the
federal Convention (1897-8), would have
writhed had lie lived to see his name dragged
through the Divorce Court, as it was last
week. His son Harold, a mature youth of
lb, was the respondent. The wife, a sister
ot the loliee Commissioner in Hobart, told
Schutt, J,, the story of her wrongs—how at-
tentions were lavished on other women, and
how she was neglected, although ready to
overlook the past. One point related in
Harolds favor was that, although so close
up to the age-limit, he enlisted in 1917. Re-
spondent let her have it all her own way,
ami Justice registered the decree nisi,
leaving over the question of alimony. An
adopted child appears to be the only “en-
cumbrance.”
TTnie Russell, who married the young
Chinaman Thomas J. Chia in Melbourne a
few years back, is applying for a divorce
from her erratic husband, who is alleged to
be living in New York. Chia, who spells
it ‘ IPsieh” nowadays, was Chinese Acting-
Consul in Melbourne for a while, and later
played a star part in a violent scene with
his successor which cost him a period of
sad reflection in gaol. A well-educated and
polished citizen, he might have done well
in the service of his, country, but some weird
detect of character always tumbled him
down.
Herbert Brookes has been very ill, and is
off to Bananaland for sunshine and a rest
cure. _ Mrs. Brookes goes with him, and the
new infant accompanies both. The Brookes
pair are working together on the reminis-
cences of Alfred Deakin. (Mrs. Brookes
was eldest daughter Ivy.)
Mrs. Alfred Deakin stayed quietly at
home during the Prince revels. Edward,
however, made a special call upon her, was
charming and sympathetic, and chatted for
a long time about his mother and boyishly
intimate home news.
The Apple Island will probably burst and
go up -in smoke before ever 11.R.H. sets
eyes on it. The citizens are blazing with
hysterics and quarrels. All because the
curtailed dates of the royal visit won’t go
round. Lady Allardyce wants dinners and
dances at Government House. The citizens
want mayoral receptions, addresses and
dances. The Red Cross wants parties of
its own. A prominent citizeness has gone
into retirement and sulks, and her followers
have formed a fourth faction.
Mrs. Eccles, Hobart’s mayoress, gave a
dance in the Court-room last week to wel- ■
come home Miss Allardyce, daughter of the
Governor. The young person had merely
been on a shopping orgy in Melbourne; but
isn’t that a good enough excuse for a jazz?
Mrs. Phyllis Reggie Power tracked off.
last week from her husband’s Albury wool-
paddocks to say good-bye to father Rupert
Clarke and her young stepmother. Rupert
is taking his wife r and the small son to
America. - , •
For the Citizens’ Ball at Hobart the
heads have hit on an idea which may work
well or may start civil war. It is designed
to save floor-space for dancing without
crowding Edward Windsor. The plan is to
have two bands and a roped-off space. One
band plays, a regular programme for the
Prince space; the other plays extras in the
intervals for the crowd outside the ropes.
If Edward chooses a partner from over the
ropes there will be a riot. The Committee
says, anxiously, that it is doing its best to
hold the Prince, Edward having left Mel-
bourne dances early because of the mobbing.
Dorothy Low, who recently changed her
name to Vargas in London, beat her car-
toonist brother to the church by about a
fortnight. Pier Spanish-American husband
is a full-blown Don, and has enough to keep
them in opulent comfort if they feel that
way. The representative of the. Colombian
Republic in the Fog, he is also the English
headquarters of a flourishing business. He
has taken a flat in Portman Square, where
his dainty little wife can peer closely into
the peerage. Their nest is entirely sur-
rounded by penurious dukes who have been
hit by the super income-tax. One of them
was lately reported to have been seen priz-
ing a diamond from his coronet to try to
induce the baker to call again.
The Naval and Military Ball had hard
luck. Baulked of a date during the visit
of the Fleet, it was rolled further down the
calendar by strikes. It happened at last
on Friday night in the Town Hall, and
was almost dismal. There were two com-
mittees- —one feminine, the other masculine.
They did not quarrel—oh, dear no ! —but
each committee took its own sweet way.
There was some clash of naval and military
interests, and a mere baker’s dozen of
uniformed soldiers turned up. One naval
man was sighted. He was a boy with that
wiggle of gold braid on the cuff which
comes between a middy and a sub-lieuten-
ant. The rest of the company were civilians,
with a few Diggers out of khaki.
The Town Hall is a big place, so the
four or five hundred looked scattered. The
balcony w T as sold to onlookers, who came in
drab coats and hats. Diggers from the
Caulfield Hospital fixed all the decorations
and made a great job of it. They covered
acres of leafless branches with cotton-wool
snow, made thousands of red robins, and
cunningly hid the central light under a
snowball. Mrs. (Dr.) Lambert had whole
holly-bushes in bloom brought from Mace-
don. One Digger took a flashlight, and was
back in the hall with printed copies to sell
for the hospitals before the last dance.
The revel was given for a long list of
charities, and the economical supper didn’t
please the hearty feeders. The outer
reaches o_f the hall had the gloomy look of
the morning after. Piles of Prince decora-
tions were in corners, with the seamy side
showing. The gorgeous mayoral roorhs of
the upper regions were shut off by blank
locked doors and the pretty little debs, had
no hiding-places at all.
The Gaud Mayor was away somewhere
on business. Mrs. Stein supported black
chiffon brocade and a bouquet of viqlets
which she held up stiffly during each dance.
Colonel Isaacson was a genial committee
host. His wife wore a glowing dress of
cherry color and a plump little daughter
was mostly pink. Mrs. Sellheim got a great
effect out of an Indian embroidered silk.
Mrs. Pearce wore black and an Oriental
head-band. The bulk of the Sassiety tread-
millers were either in Sydney or taking a
rest cure in bed. The members of the
committee who had advised postponement
till August signalled “I told you so!” in
every line of their faces.
But the Naval and Military Clubmen have
■planned a top-notch ball as a house-warming
when they move to their new quarters
later in the year.
Mrs. and Miss Henry Hayseed are openly
or secretly applauding Irvine for hitting
Henry in the place where he lives. His
Ex., who formerly represented country con-
stituencies in the State and Federal Par-
liaments, said he had noted that the men on
the land were not nearly as keen on secur-
ing appliances to help their wives in the.
household work as in obtaining labor-saving
machinery for the farm. There were many
women in private hospitals in Melbourne,
he had learned, who had been literally worn
out with toil in their country homes. He
had no time for the success that produced
that sort of result. If Irvine had spoken
a little more plainly, and said that the
private hospitals that held these, patients
were largely those that specialised in nerve
and border-line cases, he might have stung
Henry a trifle more.
Archie Emmett Adams, composer; has good
financial reason for the smile of satisfaction
he is wearing in this picture. Sydney-born,
he left Australia in 1911 with a bundle of
music under his arm to find a publisher;
He started the
pianos going in
countless British
homes with “God
Send You Back to
Me”—a ballad of
the tenderly devo-
tional sort which
exactly hit the seri-
ous war-time mood
of England. It is
reported to have
netted him £lO,OOO
within k year, and
he lately confided to
a well-known Aus-
tralian performer
that he wrote fire
music in an hour!
And “The Bells of
St. Mary’s” are
now chiming like a cash-register. “Pretty
Peggy,” a musical comedy from his pen, is
earning royalties in London, and the daunt-
less Adams now wants to compose an Aus-
tralian musical comedy. Good luck to him
if he will do it and induce some Australian
manager to put it on !
Nurses who were on the verge of getting
the eight-hour system six months ago will
have another chance in the coming State
session. The Assembly is on the side of
the hospital staffs and trainees, but the
Uppah House has to be won over. This
task is to be undertaken deftly. The
attack on members will come from their
own women relatives, who, like the majority
of the people, are developing consciences
on the subject.
Mrs. Ambrose Pratt has sent daughter
Babs on ahead to Melbourne to get ready
the home flat after her long journeyings
abroad.
The next month or two will be the open
season for big dances.. The Dean of the
Faculty and other imposing toothsmiths are
well up on the list with the Dental Ball.
This is due in the St. Kilda Town Hall on
July 6, and the deb. set is a small army. The
Women’s Automobile Club hops in the same
hall on July 23.
Tuesday of this week was given over to
the special appeal for the City Newsboys.
Walter Kirby had the programme in hand
at a cafe chantant in the Oriental Hotel,
and Miss Mcßae fixed up an evening dinner
and jazz at the same address.
The Vie. artists had their ball on Friday
night, and it was a lively revel in spite of
the clashing of dates. They went in for
futuristic design in decoration, and the dress-
ing was the usual joyous mixture of home-
made artistic effects and hired theatrical
duds. There was a procession, and a beau-
teous maiden (Lalla Rookh) was carried
round the room with flower girls sprinkling
vegetables in her path. Oriental costumes
were worn by the lady’s followers. The best
family curtains and tablecloths were looted
for the occasion, and precious sheets were
borrowed from the family linen-chest by
amateur stencillers-. The effect was voted
gorgeous; and to add to the festive air in-
flated bladders were banged and claret-cup
was drunk.
Though driving a busy pen in the Navy
Office, Bernard Cronin continues to turn out
racy Australian novels colored with his
experiences in
North-West T a s-
mania. His first
book, “The Coast-
landers,” won high
regard for its keen
characterisation and
graceful landscapes,
and now Mullens
are selling a new
one, “The Timber
Wolves,” which
gratifies the most
ardent taste for ad-
venture. Cronin is
an Englishman who
came to Tassy as an
infant, and spent 12
years’ cattle-raising
there before settling-
down as a Navy
clerk. This impression of the author is
from the camera of Alice Mills.
Newman College ball, held at St. Ivilda
Town Hall on the Prince’s birthnight, had
a crowded floor—-so crowded that the Old
Xaverians, many of whom helped to make
the dance a success, determined there and
then to have no more than 400 when their
turn comes on July 20.
Adelaide runs off the social film:—
The new Weigall Excellencies gave their first
party on the 23rd, and little Adelaide is quite
shocked because there were no programmes and
the host and hostess cleared off after only a few
hours of it, leaving the butler to receive the good-
byes. Nearly all the Best People turned up to
bump each other on the crowded floor and gape
at the battalion of flunkeys. Many fond mothers
and blushing damsels were disappointed that the
nice new Honorable A.D.C. was laid up with lum-
bago or something equally unromantic. The Mayoral
llacketts were palpably taking notes for their
counter-offensive; and some gilded youths who will
persist in wearing soft shirts with their glad rags
are wondering why they didn't receive invitations.
But the crowd thoroughly approves of the Weigall
pair, and on Saturday night, after a Theatre Royal
performance, gathered round the vice-regal car and
howled “For He’s - a Jolly Good Fellow” at the
astonished couple.
The Gordon MacFarlanes gave a pleasant dance
at the Osborne Hall on Friday last, marred oqly
by a poor floor. The super-knuts strolled rouiiJ.
late from the club dinner to the Governor.
A squad of 43 select matrons have issued invitations
to a dance for the Renown officers on July 9.
The Palais de Danse is only a moderately large
hall, but it is understood that there will be ample
standing-room for the guests.
The postponed dance given by the Humphrey
Marten and Poulten dames occurred on the 25th.
Betty, the pretty Irish-eyed eldest hope of the Reg
Hamiltons, made her first appearance at this very
cheery affair.
A large crowd witnessed the wedding of fair-
haired Helena D’Arenberg and Frank Osborn at
St. Peter’s College chapel on Thursday. The health-
drinking was at the Grand Central.
The committee of the Sir Henry Galway portrait
fund have given the job to R. G. Eves, who is
responsible for the portrait of H. B. Irving hung
in the Sydney Gallery.
The King Edward statue is being hurried into
position so that his grandson can unveil it. It
stands on North Terrace, just in front of the Insti-
tute.
Lady Galway has been giving Australian art a
lift-up in England by displaying, in her drawing-
room at Queen’s Gate, bush landscapes, the work
of Norman Lindsay, Mclnnes and Heysen. This has
reminded the Globe how little is known in England
about Australian art. “Unless, one has actually
been there it is difficult to appreciate, or even real-
ise, the beauty and vastness of Australia,” it
remarks. “But even those who have not known this
impenetrable mystic blue haze, this sphinx-like
silence, with its beautiful monotony of silver-grey
and blue, can appreciate the paintings of such
artists as Norman Lindsay, Heysen and Mclnnes.”
Staff-sergeant L. H. Howie, acting-principal of the
Adelaide School of Design, has returned with his
wife —she was Miss Davidson of the Education
Department. Howie served abroad with the 4th
Divisional Artillery. Since Christmas, 1918, he has
been working for the War Records Department, for
which he has painted 24 large pictures, and made
numerous sketches of battlefields where the Diggers
made history. He has also brought back a collection
of private paintings, and is to exhibit them.
Martin Hannah, M.L.A., who has plunged
into matrimony for the second time, is
honeymooning in N. S. Wales. Premier
Lawson sent his congratulations on the day
of the wedding (Saturday).
Dr. Eddie Spowers, the Argus magnate’s
younger brother, reputed a confirmed bache-
lor 1 , has repented, and*Beryl Loughnan, one
of the prettiest buds of the season, is to be-
come Mrs. Eddie in the near future. The
bride-elect is Mrs. Andrew Louglman’s
youngest daughter.
Indulging his hobby with paints, J. G.
White, Secretary of the Tender Board, has
turned out a much-praised canvas depicting
the arrival of the torpedo-destroyer Anzac
in Hobson’s Bay on May 26 with the Prince
on board. The fleet is shown at anchor,
dressed in greeting to the unit that went
out into the fog and brought in the royal
captain. The picture at least suggests very
effectively the atmosphere of that foggy fore-
noon.
Moiseiwitsch was a boom, so there are to
be more concerts. Sassiety wrapped itself
in furs and sat through the recitals in the
icy cold. The Russian wears adorable
clothes, and his matinee togs are poems.
Patent-leather boots with white tops go with
the “newddue” of his suits. Daisy Kennedy
haunts her husband’s concerts. Her appear-
ance with her violin is postponed because
of her health ; an operation is scheduled in
a Sydney hospital. Meanwhile, she keeps
up the interest with a mannequin parade
of new dresses. A sister from Adelaide
helps with the display of cloaks, furs,
dresses and toques.
Melba has been resting at Bournemouth
with grand-daughter Pam and the nurse.
She says the sea, the pine groves and the
millions of flowers are picking her up after
the ’flu. “The red is coming back to my
cheeks,” she writes. “I always know there’s
something wrong if I grow pale.” The Dame
was preparing for a big birthday party to
be given in London, with the King and
Queen of Portugal among her guests.
The “Passing Show” at Her Majesty’s
makes an ordinary glad-rag look like a dish-
cloth. A beautiful white girl, with a spark-
ling fantail attachment, is the apex of the
Firm’s achievement, but therd are many
other gowns and head-dresses that drain the
feminine vocabulary of superlatives. The
languid loveliness called out of the darkness
by Reg Roberts includes some rich effects
in grey and black and green, one frock
compromising its decolletage with a cute
bib arrangement tucking tightly under the
chin. Myrtle Power sings under a wonder-
ful arch of blue feathers, and scores else-
where in a kind of pyjama of silver scales.
But Maie Baird looks the dinkiest in “The
Lamp of Love.” Caught immobile with
Mel. Ward under a great golden lampshade,
she reveals the laces and graces of the 18th
century in a few measured movements, and
then resumes her marble calm under the
dazzling umbrella. It is a delicious little
picture in which the tender tints of the
costumes derive additional glory from the
limelight man.
Last week a vast tea-party spent a pleas-
ant Friday afternoon in the drawing-room
at.Menzies’. The theatrical side of it com-
prised Robert Courtneidge, his • pretty wife
and daughter Rosalind, supported by “The
Man from Toronto” co., while the society side
included about 50 of the Nicest. The Robert
Greig pair dropped in, so Mrs. Greig shared
with Mrs. Courtneidge and Margaret Swal-
low the distinction of a floral offering, the
three bouquets being made of violets—and
Mrs. Courtneidge protested that they were
the biggest violets she had seen anywhere
outside the South of France. During pauses
in the conversation Irene Certo sang charm-
ingly, and loud applause after her last item,
the “Hindu Chant of Despair,” was led by
Courtneidge. Whereupon the approval of
every matron from Toorak and South Yarra
grew more pronounced than ever. Young
Norman Lee, who was to have given humor-
ous monologues, changed his mind and sang
“Pale Hands I Loyed>” as though he were
rehearsing for a funeral. Soon after the
tea-party came a cable summoning Court-
neidge to America; so he and his wife will
be _ off this week to Sydney, where the
amiable expert has promised to do some
“producing” for the Hon. Tivoli Mclntosh.
Esq., before saying au revoir to Australia.

LETTER

Cobweb and Mustard-seed and I’eas-pod
were busy the other afternoon, for they bad
to help Boronia and Flannel Flower and
Gum Blossom and Waratah to do the hon-
ors at the Prince’s birthday party. Of
course there were big girls and boys, too,
of 10 or maybe 12. but they had to do only
marches and flag-drill, whereas all the little
ones had to dance about the maypoles.
Welsh girls and sailors and colleens from
Ireland all tripped it gaily in spite of a
wind that nearly tore the ribbons from
their grasp and almost lifted the various
fairy queens and the four pages attached to
each extended train sky-high ; for the wind
pretended that the queens’ -trains were sails,
and puffed and blew them, and swished them
high and low, and it was only stern deter-
mination on the part of the faithful attend-
ants that prevented queen and coronet and
all from taking a Ross Smith flight. Later
literally thousands of little girls swung on
to the green and marched and stepped and
paced with such freedom of limb and move-
ment as suggested an apprenticeship to the
Russian ballet or a new company of Ama-
zons for Flora Sandes to take back to Serbia.
Just as the pretty windblown tangle of
hair and slim legs came marching off to
give place to the boys, there was a mut-
tered ‘ Here he comes !” from 80,000, throats,
bands struck up “God Bless the Prince
of Wales,” and all the children—Mustard-
seed and Cobweb and Peas-pod and all —.
were. as quickly back on to the grounds
as agitated teachers could shoo them. But
Suest of honor—he came late
after an hour, during which space
Game Margaret and Daphne and Diana
made the afternoon glad for him. Finally
I s^ es fluttered like so many bits of
thistledown into the young man’s own fea-
thers and waggled a festive plume at him
from a Happy Returns” embroidery. Then
once more every youngster’s colors were
unfurled and the grounds became a field of
A®,£ s > while the thin treble of youth im-
plored the ear of the Almighty and besought
blessings upon all the royalties, and de-
ctured that Britannia rules the waves. After
which the enormous crojvd that had
struggled and surged in at the gates earlier
m the day did another sprint to have one
more look at the young man from Windsor.
For the gala performance Her Majesty’s
was a blaze of light and a bower of sweet
scents to make even a young man who has
been in most of the great theatres of Europe
draw m his breath from sheer amazement
and joy. The management had done things
regardless, even to attar of roses and
souvenir programmes. The royal box was
suggestive of the balcony scene from Romeo
and Juliet —only not shady enough—or a
floral arbor in “The Decameron”; and not
to spoil the ship for a ha’porth of tar, the
entire stage at once section became a bed
of roses, but (thank Heaven!) without dia-
logue of the Double or Twin Couch variety.
Ot course everybody was there, the whole
wide Sydney that is a permanent dead-
head, with the portion of the public that
pays the highest price for having its view
blocked by the first-named. Lady Helen
deciding to have a night off, Mrs. Duncan
sat beside the young man in the G.-G.’s
box, all in pink with silver leaves in her
hair; but at half-time Dame Margaret’s
white brocade and absolutely gorgeous
eimine cape lured him to the onnosite camp,
where old Sydney pals, such as John Storey
kept dropping in on him.
The pageant that preceded “Kissing Time”
was a . wonderful affair. Flo Young was
the Spirit of Empire, and one by one the
Dominions draped themselves about her
each singing or elocuting heroic lines, of a
real-estate advertisement pattern, about the
merits of her own bit of the earth. Nell
Stewart, in a clinging robe, slit well up
to display the same shapely leg that Sydney
loved of old, came on as Maoriland, and
received an ovation greater even than the
Princes; and when Nell, who has no undue
bulk .to take from the effect, swept a Du
Barn curtsey, and declaimed the opening
lines in the old silvvr-sweet tones, Edward,
in spite of an almost continuous round of
God Save, had still enough sense of music
to S t [P l a listening ear. Yards of bunting
and the MacCunn music turned Gladys Cole
Au straha, whlle Glad .ys Moncrieff
and Maudie Fane were among the overseas
mcense-swingers.
After the Gala performance the Prince-
chap and his retinue went on to the dance
given by Barbara and Janet Knox's people
at Ilona. As this party was entirely com-
posed of “representative” families, there is
a somewhat muffled note in the reports of
the festivities. Hilarity was not the pass-
word. Rosamund Lumsdaine again bagged
the high-voltage jazzer; and Barbara Bow-
ker and Ursula Catterall were new ones on
Baby-skin’s programme. Mollie Little was
not of the party. Mollie doesn’t care; her
affairs march well. H.R.H. now calls her
Moll.
The Tony Hordern dance on the Prince’s
return from Canberra was voted “the bon-
zer affair.” The house —the second-most
brilliantly illuminated one on Darling Point;
Lebby’s fireworks beat it for first place—
lends itself beautifully to the gay life; and
Mrs. Tony saw that stiffness and formality
were entirely absent.
A feature of the Tony Horderns’ dance
was a huge supper of strawberries. Another
amenity which, considering the condition of
Rheims and one thing and another, amounted
to a phenomenon, was the 1906 Moet, bottles
of which were at every guest’s elbow. Since
the Union Club rashly drank up all of this
wine that it possessed at its last ball, most
of the local epicures had given up hope of
meeting it again.
Pretty and slim Mrs. Heni’y Hill Osborne
revelled nearly all the week 'in silver lace,
and though she didn’t dance with the Prince
her programmes read like a page of Burke’s
Peerage. She was one of the party of girls
and boys who received the countersign from
Edward at the Queen’s Club Ball to make
their escape immediately after supper. Poor
Prince, it’s* not all honey being England’s
hope! When he entered the Queen’s Club
hall a long, long avenue of hostess-matrons
(Springwood to Strathfield or North Shore
line season-ticket holders) extended its
hand to him, and watched to see him duly
impressed with how we do things. His
supper-partner was Miss Macarthur Onslow,
while Mrs. Fred Orr, of 52 Macl6ay-sti*eet,
was led towards the chicken by Lord Claude
Hamilton. If the night held any more rods
in pickle for the Prince nobody knows, for
the youngster, exercisiqg his Princely pre-
rogative, gathered up his favorites and
dashed to Government House, where the
party that included Mollie Little, Ursula
Catterall, Mrs. Duncan, Doreen Hordern
and another round-dozen girls and men
danced till cock-crow under the eye of Dame
Margaret.
_ The dance on the Australia last week,
given by the captain and officers to the
captain and officers of the Renown, put the
social cachet upon your Sydney standing.
Everybody who was asked turned up to it
just to show she hadn’t been left out. All
the royal favorites were there, and pretty
Clytie Coffee made a last festive splash be-
fore her sister, Mrs. John Osborne, and
the Malay States claim her; while Mrs.
Sep Levy’s ankles were the envy of every
girl aboard when a companion-way had to
be negotiated.
The Royal Fledgling, who, in the
immortal title of Ben and John Fuller’§
bellowdrama, has “No Mother to Guide
Him” (though Lady Davidson did her best),
went off to Westralia on Friday after a
rush-visit to the Hawkesbury and New-
castle. Mollie Little solaces herself with
an autographed photograph of the Royal
Youth; but the other girleens have only
memories. But such memories !
There’s the memory of the Street party
that had the temerity to hang its sign out
for the same night as the Tony Horderns’
expensively-irrigated flutter, and came out
fifty-fifty. The Street dance made almost a
corner in pretty girls and good music, and
after the Tony Hordern gambol all the
sprigs of England’s tall ancestral trees
dropped in and gave the girls the night of
their lives.
Here is a photograph of the Birdwood
bust modelled by Svdney sculptor Nelson
Illingworth. All
who ever saw the
General will be
struck with the
wonderful likeness:
truly Birdie lives
again in marble—
the straight, search-
ing look; the dry
humor of the mouth ;
the intense humane-
ness of the features
in spite of the sol-
dier look dominat-
ing all. The Gen-
era] gave the little
man in the high
studio (and you
shall have his photo
presently) only five
sittings, all of them
hurried. But here is the finished work com-
plete even to the last decoration.
Lady Dudley, who was drowned while
bathing at Connemara in Ireland on Satur-
day, never won much popularity in Austra-
lia. She was putting up her last desperate
struggle for the affections of her errant
spouse at the time, and it tended to embitter
her. In the closing stages of the campaign
her icy figure, brilliant with gems, cast a
sort of blight on every ballroom that she
entered. She was one of the Gurney bank-
ing family, and after the famous house
smashed she was taken in hand by the re-
cently-deceased Duchess of Bedford and
launched socially. (So was her sister
Laura, who married one Troubridge, a
stockbroking descendant of Nelson’s famous
Admiral.) Though naturally reserved and
shy. Lady Dudley could be amiable enough
to those she liked: the trouble, from the
standpoint of her husband, was that they
weren’t Australians. Her acrid comments
on the stable, as. opposed to table, manners
of some of his squatter-friends did her lord
a lot of harm; and he was not doing himself
much good with the ultra-virtuous section
at the time. The fact was they were both
disappointed by the death of their friend
Edward VII., whose promised visit would
have meant a marquisate if not a dukedom
for Dudley; and a kind of don’t-give-a-
d—n spirit settled over Government House
in consequence.
Most of the dailies referred to the Prince’s
“colored tie,” and a weekly intimated last
Thursday that he “was wearing the Princely
racing colors, red and blue.” The mysteri-
ous garment is really the tie worn with
mufti by members of the Brigade of Guards.
The dull-red and dark-blue stripes are the
commonest of West End spectacles during
the season in London, as the Guardsmen
sport them on their straw hats as well as
round their necks.
Jean Drummond is just back in Sydney
after 11 years’ study in Germany and Italy ;
and the beautiful soprano will be beard
next Saturday week with the State
Orchestra. The Sydney girl (May Moore
has pictured her for us) tells you frankly
that victory goes to hard work plus money.
When she first went away she made for
Germany. In Berlin she sang and was told
“You must go to King-Clark in Paris. He
is the master-
teacher.” So to
Paris and the fam-
ous American
teacher (at the time
of his death he was
giving as many as
180 lessons a week)
Jean travelled. She
was there a month,
when King-Clark
announced: “We go
to Berlin. In* Ger-
many there are 300
opera houses, in
each of which
grand opera is
sung every week. To
bear the stamp lof
an operatic artist in
Germany one must
have a repertoire of at least 15 operas.
You see how it is.” So back to Berlin,
where King-Clark had set up his school.
After that other teachers, including Sattler
for Plastics —which is the art of expressing
operatic emotion. All of these lessons ranged
from 30s. to 10s., and none lasted longer
than 25 minutes. After that y<yi had your
accompanist’s fees to pay, the concerts and
the operas to attend, and your Italian, Ger-
man and French lessons to pay for.
When war broke out the Sydney girl went
to Milan, where she studied with Stralia’s
teacher Falchi, who is from the St. Cecilia
Conservatorium at JEtome. Jean has sung in
Lodz, in Milan and in as much of Europe
as the general disruption would allow. A
cable telling of their mother’s sickness
brought her and her sister back to Sydney
about a month ago.
For some unknown reason the practice of
submitting lists of guests to the Prince of
Wales (to be added to or reduced
according to the royal wishes) was not
followed at Sydney functions. This last,
faint survival of the mediaeval droit de
Seigneur was much cherished by the young
man’s grandfather, Edward. Here the royal
guest had to almost fight for some of his
friends’ invitations, while as regards at least
one festivity, not only was one young woman
unasked but her mother proclaimed that she
wouldn’t be allowed to go to the house if
she was asked. H.R.H. had here bumped
against one of those dark problems in Syd-
ney exclusiveness which are soluble only
by the initiate. The Jones family (say)
draws its considerable revenues from
molasses. The Boneses subsist with equal
indifference to H.C.L. upon the sale of (for
example) the tins in which molasses are
stored. Both families are composed, on the
whole, of God-fearing, respectable anti-
Laborites; and the males belong to the same
Club. And yet, in the social sense, an un-
fathomable gulf separates them. No mas-
culine Bones has ever got his legs beneath
the Jones mahogany; no female Bones has
penetrated, visiting-card in hand, the neat
suburban residence which the founder of the
Jones dynasty built full 45 years ago. “It
is nice to see him enjoying himself,” mur-
mured a typical Jones lady last week, “but
I would have preferred that he should be
dancing with a member of one of Qur Old
Families.” To the guileless Prince the
arrivist from Turramurra or Hunter’s Hill
is the same as the patrician whose sphere
of influence is Double Bay. If he were not
so transparently amiable this quality might
sap the loyalty of persons in unexpected
places. As things are his democratic ways
save him. All being understood, all is for-
given—even his persistent association with
politicians.
Because the guest-lists were not submitted
to the Prince, he was several times de-
prived of his pet partners. Tales are whis-
pered of aides dashing to the city’s outskirts
and humbly presenting invites even at the
11th hour. No one thus bidden seems to have
sent a refusal, even if she had to confound
an enemy with her sweetest smile and a coat-
ing of her best, warranted stick-fast powder.
The tremendously select Government House
party was rather a frost, there being not
nearly enough partners for the girls, who
sat about till the room was suggestive of a
chicken-roost rather than of a party to the
Jazz Prince. The mistake was made through
seeing so many men over at the big crush
the previous week. A lot of girls who were
not on the first list received cards a day or so
before the event, and duly arrived —which
was unfortunate for many in the first batch,
for the second lot bagged most of the gold
braid and epaulettes.
Latest fad amongst the girlfe is an invi-
tation album in which to keep forever bound
the calls they had to “functions” during the
royal visit. What some of them are not
keeping a record of is the date and the hour
when the cards arrived.
One of the prettiest figures at the
exclusive Saturday night State Government
House dance was Nellie Payne, looking like
a Watteau shepherdess; and one of the
most striking effects at the Governor-
General’s hop was gained by Carrie Moore.
His Ex. Weigall, of South Aus., has been
discriminating enough to ask Rene Maxwell
to sing before Edward when the young man
is in Adelaide. Rene herself looks like a
fresh wild-flower, and her voice will cer-
tainly be a change from the usual patriotic
programme the young man undergoes.
Grandmamma and sister May have already
heard Rene; also the Duke and Duchess of
Newcastle. Oh, no, not the Earps; the Eng-
lish ones.
Of the men on the Renown the beauty
prize goes to Dr. White, who is tall, dark
and handsome. But the Hamilton lordling
has an eye that twinkles over everything.
John Storey, who, in spite of persistent
rumors, did not go to the G.-G.’s ball in
striped pink-and-grey flannel pyjamas, now
has a pair of gold sleeve-links to bind Demo-
cracy to the Throne.
One club_ in Sydney has been lamenting
that the Prince would not come and play in
its yard. With the knowledge that H.R.H.
is a keen squash-racquet player, a court
was fixed up, and those in the know were
asked to bring a lady friend. Needless to
say the place was packed, but no Prince!
Later a whisper passed that the royal car
had been at the Bjelke-Petersens’ Physical
Culture School!, The exclusive four who
played there for a couple of hours in-
cluded H.R.H., Lieut.-Col. Grigg, Col. Peter-
sen and A. N. Bishop.
As unobtrusively as she had done all her
good work at the Kantara canteen, Rania
Macphillamy, 0.8. E., was married last week
at the Waroo Church, near Forbes, to her
D. 5.0., . Dr. Clive Single, who served in
Gallipoli and Palestine, and is at home
in Australia at Mudgee. Rania, who is
the elder daughter of the Macphillamys of
Waroo station, Forbes, wore soft white
satin and mother’s wedding veil for the
great occasion. Sister Nerida bridesmaided
in palest pink; and Colonel B. V. Stacey.
C.M.G., D. 5.0., helped her. The wedding
breakfast was spread at Waroo homestead.
Freda Sternberg, back in Sydney and on
her way to Melbourne after nearly two
years in the U.S.A., where she has been
doing publicity and free-lance journalism,
confesses joy at being once more where food
and clothes are not quite the price they were
in New York when she left there. Freda’s
idea now is to manage concert artists. Her
first bird will be Madame Cadorin, who used
to be _ Lovie Mueller, of Bendigo. Cadorin,
who is an Italian sculptor, fought all
through the war; and Lovie did a lot of
singing for soldiers in the States while hus-
band was helping to save Venice.
The preference-to-soldiers principle was
cut out at vice-regal functions. Not that
soldiers weren’t asked : that would have been
an impossibility, since almost every fit male
of the old pre-war Government-House fre-
quenting families became some sort of a
military man. But while distinguished fight-
ing-men who had risen to high rank abroad
were ignored, absurdly undistinguished home-
service officers were bidden to the feasts.
There was, however, no shortage of cor-
diality for men who had gained commissions
in the British Army. To have been a lieu-
tenant in the Mangelwurzelshires or the
Imperial A.S.C. counts more at most Gov-
ernment Houses nowadays than the winning
of a majority (with trimmings) in the late
Australian Army.

THE possession of a Beale Player-Piano brings the
world’s best music to your fingers’ ends. In it you
find an instrument of expression which releases all
the surging emotions that forever before have been
stifled and inarticulate.
The Beale provides a piano which appeals to all that
is best in your musically proficient friends-~-and also a
technique which enables you to re-live old favourites
when you are thrown on your own resources for en-
tertainment. Song-rolls, especially if you sing, open
the widest possible field for enjoyment.
With a player-piano you have a versatility that tran-
scends the greatest repertoire of the greatest living
virtuoso. A Beale brings the world of music to your
finger tips.
The better musician you are the more you 'will appreciate the c ßeale

WINTON.
The “Winton” stock is one of our
thoroughbred saddles, and is without
doubt the most comfortable high-pad
stock saddle made. The flaps in this
saddle are seamed direct on to the
seat, doing away with the usual skirt
and giving a narrow, comfortable non-
chafing grip. The pads are brought
high up over the stirrup bars and
along the rider’s thighs, giving per-
fect security to the rider. Made on
our best “Fouright” tree and fitted
with solid nickel stirrups, bevelled
leathers and folded girth.

unless stamps accompany. '
Award Rate: Yes, perhaps they didn’t
behave like courtiers when they called on Lawson.
And thank Heaven for it. If they were courtiers
they wouldn’t be doing their very necessary but
horribly rough job. Because you can’t make silk
purses out of sows’ ears it doesn’t follow that
sows’ ears are of less value than silk purses....
Hand}' Billy: Yes, of course, “Senex’s” “knots per
hour” was wrong. But he really knows as well as any-
body that the “per hour” was superfluous... .E.E.H.:
Well-trodden ground.... Dingo: No bite in it....
Exul: It was Justice Stephen—Mathew Henry—who
instructed a jury that it was no offence to express
the opinion that the Republican was the best form
of government.... Immature M.: Thanks. . We’ll ask
him to explain... .Lagoon: Pity you didn’t send it
at the time.... Oliver B.: “The Chow” is a bit of
the real stuff: —•
....Thomas G.: “Second Coming” doesn’t work out
we 11.... Banyook: If every piece of copy handled
was marked with notes for the guidance of the
writer in future, we should require an addition of
about 740 sub-editors to the staff. And, Lord!
wouldn’t they quarrel over those notes !.... Caris-
sima: Simply awful D.E. (Elsternwick) : Misses
0.M.A.: Nothing there.... G.E.C.: Without a glim-
mer of mirth Richard M.: The man who writes
on “Vers Libre” and says that irregular rhythms
have never been successful except in “Kubla Khan”
has no right to a hearing... .J.M.S.: As far as we
can read it, it seems to be no g00d... .W.E.K.:
“Home” is too commonplace and “Politicians” too
crude.... Harry W.: “Narrow Escape” doesn’t thrill.
....The M.H.; Not enough marrow in “Spelling
Lesson”.... Sydney G.: Rather heavy fooling....
Anon: Nothing in it... .Scotchie :No good. .. .R.B.
(Sydney): Yarn cruder than before... .H.N.L.:
Pretty rotten.... V.Y.: “Prayer” moves nicely, but
the refrain line is not effective... .Sydney H. W.: “A
Ramble in the Bush” filling nine pages with un-
poetical blank verse is a bit over the odds... .R.8.L.:
“Westminster” hardly interesting enough... .D.F.
(Whangarei): No u5e....P.M.: “Em’ly” is a poor
handling of indifferent stuff... .C.H.S.: Not up....
E. (Kilsyth): “Poultry Keeper” looks as if it
were written “on the spur of the moment”; it
might even have been written with the spur of the
rooster... .Simplex: “Beware” won’t d 0... .T.H.S.:
No. .. .Dr. B.: It suffers from pernicious anaemia. ...
G.R.H.: Nary a thrill.... The Exile: It bumps all
over the place J.H.L.: Don’t care enough for
“Dusty H01e”.... W.J.C.: Why not finish it before
sending it?....M.F.: “Jimmy” doesn’t thrill u 5....
F. : “Sede” is a sad and wooden affair, and the
carpentering isn’t of much account.... Alidade: Not
enough there. .. .W.J.D.: Townsville sketch fails....
D. : “The Call” makes us more sorrowful than
angry. .. .R.S.M.: Not the sort of thing we hanker
after. .. .T.G. (Greenwich): Shocking remarks about
the Prince noted. .. .K.A.C.: Just commonplace. ...
Saxe Rohmer: “Song” hasn’t enough in it, though
the work is pretty g00d.... Sigma: Very bad....
G. : Not much use trying to write verse about
nothing unless you’re a genius. .. .J.J.C.: “Pearl
Belt” doesn’t rope us in. .. .K.A.C.: Not interested
in “M.M.”. .. .Herbert 0.: Too much melodrama. ...
E. : “Ballybray” doesn’t get to anything....
Robert G.: Nowhere near. . . .Hosea: Glad you call
the metre “dainty.” We wouldn’t go that far our-
selves.... Pip: Wordy and wearisome.... Basil O.:
Bad verse.... Tailler: You make it very du11....
1.8.5.: Can’t get interested in the fact that you
had bacon for dinner.... .M.H. (Brisbane): “Circum-
stantial Evidence” doesn’t interest.... Effie H.: Care-
less screed on two sides of tired-looking paper
rejected... .Biddy R.: What sort of an ear have you
to rhyme “gaud” and “reward”?
TO ARTISTIC (AOT> INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
E.E.K.: An old one and the drawing induces
g100m... .C. 8.5.: Clumsy drawings in the wrong
sort of ink tethered to something a friend heard
40 years ago. Swear off... .L.AiH.: True enough,
but that doesn’t excuse your bad art. .. .D.D.T.:
Venerable wowser with antique whiskers looks as if
he had crawled out of an old illustrated tract. Shut
the stodge factory... .Jack Q.: Not much humor in
those figures... .R.G.: Yes, you drew it with the
plough. .. .E.J.S.: Far too rough....F.C.H.: Why
has the young jazzer got that lunatic glare in his
eye?... .A.S.: An ancient jest to cut your artistic
teeth 0n... .M.S.H.: It’s no use starting a factory
for sneering fashion-platan trailing one toe. The
girl standing up only neieds a label, “This style,
five guineas”... .C.E.J.: Some animation in the sea
drawing. The other is obviously “dated” and be-
longs to the great pianist’s early days... .A.8.W.:
Sour, distorted things.... Overshoot: Only scrap-book
stuff... .C.G.: Very unpleasant. . . .E.J.: You haven’t
much command over your pen yet.... P.C.: English
rural drawing attached toa joke of thesame variety. We
want original Australian work.. . .M.K.: Our teeth re-
fused duty on that one... .Hal L.: A word in your ear.
You can’t draw, and the jest was invented just
after Adam had discovered that bears’ pelts kept
the cold out R.L.8.: Infuriating factory-made
wit L.E.T.: May the Argus throw her sacred
teapot at you !. .. .F.C.C.: Drawing cursed and
entombed. Jest sent on in an ambulance to the
Home for Old and Infirm Gags... .M.G.C.: A better
draughtsman has worn out two pencils on that idea.
F.C.K.: Your line is uncertain and your humor
late 8.R.: Forgiven. You may be young and
beautiful E.H.8.: One of grandfather’s, and the
drawing has that bleak and empty look, the artist
having dodged putting in the architecture....
O.E.McC.: Two impossible wowsers with beards
dipped in glue.
Down the lane in Grasshopper-street,
A row of unpleasant looking shops,
John the Chow, with his little sweet,
It’s where the people stop and swap.
You’d wonder why they stop to seek;
The cry you’ll hear, “Me sellem cheap”—
And to see his little Margarite
Sitting there, all of a heap.
“Me sellem good potater and culliflower,
Nicey turn-up and let-us-see;
And you want em flour,
With it a poun’ of tea.”
This is how you will find John Lee
Selling his stuff in great glee;
Doing trade, as you will see,
Going as hard as can be.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUT of the black of the night he came,
The hot ferns hid the dawn;
Alone in the awful loneliness
I heard his life-breath drawn.
What count the anguish and the curse?
See! in the flashing sun
Another Adam ! Another Adam !
And such a little one!
Come hither, come hither, ye spotted pards,
Behemoth and hornfed gnu,
And look on the wonder Clod hath wrought
Betwixt the dawn and the dew!
From -the cloven rock, the humid fen,
The ooze of the black abyss,
Come forth, ye mothers of teeming earth,
Can ye show aught like this?
Tea, lioness, proud with thy clumsy cub,
Well mayst thou stare to see;
And narrow-eyed leviathan
Whose spawn the sun sets free,
What wouldst thou say? He is only one?
Naked, and weak, and small ?
IIo! peering fox, thy littered six
Are foxes, after all!
Look at his brow, like the citron bud,
The open eyes below,
His crumpled hands with fingers five
And pink nails all a-row!
Up on thy feet, my Man-child ! Stand!
Look on them in thy pride,
Thou who shall crush the tiger’s rage »
And on the jaguar ride !
Grey, hairy mammoth, blow thy trump
To cheer him if he weep!
Ye chattering apes, go softly by.
Your lord doth deign to sleep!
Low they bow to thy cradling arms;
Vassals are they of thine ;
But, Littlest One, thy clinging lips
Are mine—mine —mine !
Thy father was made of a soulless clod
And. I of a riven bone;
Out of the of God we came,
Motherless and alone.
But thou art wrought of flesh and love
With the breath of God within.
Oh, surely, God, who gave me thee,
He hath forgot my sin!
And Adam, thy father, when he shall come,
He, too, shall straight forget
The flaming sword, the sealed gate,
The toiling and the sweat;
And love again as he loved before
’Neath the Forbidden Tree,
For though I lost him Paradise,
Lo, I have brought him thee!

ALEX. WHYTE.
The Holy Well.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[Ailne. is a beautiful woman of the Shee or fairies
who has the power of working love spells. Denis
and Aileen are a boy and girl from the village
below.]
Act I. —A wild place on the hillside
where three straggling thorn-hushes grow.
The hushes are very old and bearded with
lichen. It is midnight, and a nearly-full
moon is high in the sky. To the right is an
old well, among heaps of tumbled stone.
Denis comes in.
Denis : It is a foolish thing, maybe, but
there is no other way; and if the Shee
herself would craze me with forbidden
things it is too craz-ed I am with love
already. Och, Ailepn, is it sleeping you
are now in the bed up the ladder, and the
moon shining the way it makes me hungry
for a sight of your two eyes? Well, I
will try. ' f
He goes toward the thorn-bushes, plucks
a green sprig and begins to walk round them.
When he has completed the circle three
times Ailne appears. She is a creature of
lustrous beauty, and moves with a light,
unearthly grace. When she speaks her voice
is strangely soft and musical,
Ailne : Who is it that calls me in the middle
of the green year with the moon shin-
ing?
Denis : It is for the love-thought that I
want; and me thinking too long every
sad day of one white girl that has no word
at all for me.
Ailne : It is love, love, love always; and
the flowers coming out and the flowers
going away and the sweet talk and the
old graves and the world turning to a kiss
that is no more than a red flower in the
moon.
Denis : Och, wise woman, it is my heart
that is sore and Aileen not caring.
Ailne: Is it Aileen is her name? There
were twenty thousand Aileens, and for
every one there was a new kiss that was
too sweet to wear for ten summers.
Denis : Och, wise woman, will you not help
me? It is to make her love me that I
want; and me not able to live if I am
away from the sound of her voice.
Ailne ( coming close to him) : Let me look
into your face. (Sighing.) It is too
fine your mother’s dreams were; and you
dreaming still while you walk up and
down the living world.
Denis (gazing into her eyes with a strange,
rapt look) : It is no dream surely that I
have seen the wonder of the night and
the dav together in vour face. Och, may-
be it is a dream. ( Putting out his hand
and timidly touching her arm.) Och,
woman, you are warm. It is no dream
you are, surely, but the living wonder
of all the dreams set to a tune in my
heart.
Ailne : Och, well, Aileen will love you very
well. She is dreaming now that you have
put a kiss on her mouth; and she will not
be rid of the taste of it till she has
another one to keep in its place.
Denis ( starting back) : Aileen. Och, yes,
Aileen. But, woman of this wild place,
your eyes are two full stars and my heart
is trembling at the light of them.
Ailne ( laughing ) : The light of them is to
guide you into the two white arms of
Aileen that are warmer than mine.
Denis : Aileen. Och. yes, Aileen. It was
about Aileen, surely; but it is the way
you stand there in the moon that ig mak-
ing a song in me like a little rivir run-
ning down over brown stones to a great
sea that is full of all the music of fifes
and fiddles.
Ailne ( laughing again) : It is you have the
tongue, surely; for your mother dreamt
too fine a dream.
Denis : Och, heart, would you mock me;
and me thinking too long a thought for
all the stars and the yellow moon itself?
Ailne (very quietly ): I would not mock
you, Denis. Och, yes, I have your name
for 20 years ; and it making a little song
sometimes among the other songs. I
would not mock you, heart; but I am sit-
ting a thousand years on one green hill
thinking of old graves that are very green
and old eyes that in other years were very
bright. And I have been wanting a little
grave of my own that is very quiet, with
the grass above that is wet in the dew ;
but I have only the moon and the sun and
the little birds and the blue skies and the
dreams of them that loved and died and
went away. Go down to your Aileen and
she will love you too ; for I am old—very
old.
Denis : Heart, you are not old. You are
young. Och, what would a man say? It
is like a beam of the moon that you are,
dancing in my heart; and I am mad for
the joy of you.
Ailne: It was your mother came to me for
tlie love-word of your father.
Denis : It is my mother’s son that is come
to you for the love-word of yourself and
no other. Would you be putting me
away with a small talk of other years,
and me looking into your eyes?'
Ailne: Och, Denis.
Denis : Kiss me, heart. I have no fear of
the graves and the years. Let me kiss
you and then wither up to death like a
little blade of grass. There is nothing
else at all.
Ailne (softly) : It is a dream, surely. I
will be waking up and finding the sun
shining or the rain falling and nothing
here at all. (Sh 6 puts out her hands
strangely as if groping in the darkness.)
Denis : Kiss me, heart.
Ailne : It is a madness too sweet for the
world.
She falls into his arms. Denis kisses her
passionately. Then she breaks away from
him and stands listening. A bell rings.
Denis: What is it, heart?
Ailne glides away behind the thorn-bushes.
Denis stands listening to the bell till it
ceases.
Denis: She is gone. It was the bell that
called her. Och. but she will come back.
She will come hack to me.
Act II. — The same place the next even-
ing. The moon has just risen and the thorn-
bushes throw long shadows.
Aileen comes in.
Aileen : It is here that she would be. if
she will come when I make the sign. Och,
Denis! What is it ails me at all? And
what is it ails him that he will not look
at me? There is a pain that has stayed
with me all the' day and a long thought
that is sweet find bitter. Maybe he is
with the boys at the cross-roads telling
tales and laughing with the rest: and me
sick in my own soul for the sight of his
two eyes. Well, there is thorn fo pluck
and a small way .to walk round the bushes,
and maybe she'will come to help me.
She plucks a sprig of thorn and walks
round the bushes as Denis had done on the
previous night. Ailne appears. Aileen
runs to her and grasps her hands.
Aileen : Och, wise woman, it is for Denis,
that he would love me.
Ailne : Why would he love you ? Why
would a king of the world love a young
girl that has only a foolish thought out
of a small dream?
Aileen (releasing Ailne's hands and step-
ping back shyly) : It was a dream, surely.
Ailne : It was a dream surely ; and you not
thinking about him at all till his kiss
came to you in a foolish sleep.
Aileen : Wise woman, my heart is sore.
Ailne: It is because you are very young
and the summer is full of green leaves.
Aileen : Och, what will I do? For I
thought you would help me surely to make
him love me.
Ailne: Let me look into your face. (She
conies close to her and peers into her
eyes.) _ Och, well, maybe you will have
a man’s love and a small grave at the
end that is very quiet.
Aileen (timidly) : You will help me, sweet
woman?
Ailne : You have a face like a soft flower.
Aileen: It is Denis that I want.
Ailne (suddenly walking away) : It is the
very old moon that is laughing at me.
Aileen : It is my heart that is too sore.
Ailne (coming back) : It is an old heart
that knows ; for a young heart is drily
the summer making the blood warm.
Aileen: Sweet woman. Denis is young:
and it is Denis I want to be near me
always.
Ailne (sighing) : Och. well, it is a fine
night and there is soft moss to sit on by
the well.
Aileen (dreamily) : Is it by the old well
that I must sit?
Ailne ( suddenly) : Girl, go now quickly
and sit where there is a dark shadow,
but make no noise at all.
Aileen goes quietly to the well. She sits
down where she can scarcely be seen. Denis
comes in quickly and goes to Ailne, trying to
take her hands.
Denis: Heart, have I found you?
Ailne moves away from him.
Ailne : Och. don’t touch me.
Denis : But I will touch you surely, and
take you in my arms and feel the beat-
ing of your heart. Och. Ailne. I want
you, if all the thousand years between us
had seven graves for every year and every
grave of them all my own.
Ailne : It is too foolish I am to listen to
you. There is Aileen
Denis : There is you only and no other
woman.
Ailne (wildly) : It is a curse there is some-
where might break on us all.
Denis : No. but kiss me and we will laugh
at every curse.
Ailne seems about to yield when Aileen
rushed , towards them.
Aileen : Och, Denis, my soul.

Tired, Achy
“Every Picture
aStory”
Played Out?
Are you dull, tired, achy all over —bothered with a “bad
back” ? Do you lack energy for the day’s work? Evening
find you “all played out”? Don’t worry so much about
it! You can’t expect to feel up to par if your kidneys are
not acting right. The kidneys need help occasionally,
just as the bowels need help. A dull, nagging backache;
soreness, lameness and sharp, sudden pains are all
symptoms of neglected kidneys. You may have head-
aches and dizziness, too, and perhaps some annoying
kidney irregularity. Don’t wait for more serious
trqubles. Get back your health and keep it! Use Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. They have helped thousands and should help you. Ask your neighbor!
SYDNEY PEOPLE CURED.
A WATERLOO RESIDENT.
Mrs. W. Sullivan, 2 Brisbane Street, Waterloo, Sydney, says:—“l suffered
terribly with my kidneys for some time. I had terrible pains in my back, and could
hardly move without suffering torture. Every time I stooped I would get a twinge
across my kidneys like the stab of a knife, and I could not help screaming out. I
was also subject to bad headaches, dizzy feelings, and had urinary trouble, the
secretions being thick and cloudy, and difficult to pass. Nothing I took seemed to
suit my case, and I suffered on in spite of treatment, but at last I got a good remedy
and that was Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. A friend advised me to take a
course of these t pills, which I did, and I am pleased to say they cured me of every
distressing symptom mentioned above. I used ten bottles in all, and my cure is
perfect, for I have been as right as rain for the last twelve months.”
Six years later Mrs. Sullivan says“Doan’s -Backache Kidney Pills cured me
of backache and kidney trouble seven years ago, and I am still well, but I always
keep this remedy by me and take a dose or so now and then, just as a help to the
kidneys.”
A NORTH SYDNEY RESIDENT.
Mr. H. Holder. Euronga, Amhurst Street, North Sydney, says :—“Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills are indeed a wonderful kidney medicine. I have proved this.
For a long time I suffered agony from backache and kidney trouble, and only those
who have been afflicted in this way have any idea what I went through. My limbs
swelled considerably, the kidney secretions were thick and cloudy, with a red sedi-
ment, and I had agonising pains in my back. When I stooped it was as much as
I could do to stand up straight again without assistance, my baek was so stiff
and lame. I was treated by a doctor, and tried all sorts of remedies, but nothing
gave me the slightest relief. I was naturally very worried about the serious state
of my health, and when Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were brought under my
notice I decided to try them. It was a grand thing for me that I got this remedy,
for seven bottles cured me completely. I cannot speak too highly of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and recommend them with every confidence to other
sufferers.”
Four years later Mr. Holder says: “I have still the same good opinion of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured me of kidney disorder four years ago,
and I have had no return of the complaint since.”

■Suddenly the bell rings and they all stand
listening. As the sound dies away Ailne
draios back from them a pace. She stands
■ erect and rigid with a far-off look in her
eyes.
Ailne: Listen, children.
Denis : Och, heart, it is you I want.
Aileen : Och, Denis, come to me. It is you
only I want.
Ailne: Listen, children. There are three
of us here and we are all very sick and
in need of healing.
Denis : It is sick I am surely for the love of
you in mj heart.
" Aileen : It is sick 1 am surely for a long-
thought of you, Denis.
Ailne : It is sick 1 am most of all: for I
am very old and the foolishness of them
that are young is still in my heart. Will
you let me tell you?
Denis : Sweet woman, I will listen all the
long night to you speaking, for a hard
word on your mouth has more music than
all the songs in the world.
Ailne (in a far-away voice) : It: was a
thousand years ago that he came, here and
made a small chapel by the well. I was
in the thorn-bushes; and he set up the
stones day after day and the. cross on the
top of the stones and a bell to ring under
the cross. And every day I looked out
and saw him coming and going up the
hdl or down, through the whin-bushes or
wnlking with his book whiten the sun was
red in the west. And every day I hated
him for the bell and the cross and the
prayer lie made; but iris eyes were young,
kind eyes and he walked like, a proud
king that is humble beseatii.se he knows his
own way. It was this well that he blest;
and it is a well of healing surely for all
the days. But it was a thousand years
ago; and, och, hearts., he died and the
chapel fell down to a Leap of stones be-
side the well, and all the green world
forgot him. Och, how would I forget?
It was a thousand years ago and him
lying in a small grave green with grass.
And there was I in the thorn-bushes
thinking long thoughts to the old moon
and the old sun and the very old stars.
Would a woman forged, would a woman
forget? (She pauses with her beautiful
head bowed on her breast. Denis and
Aileen stand motionless .) ■ And, och, it
was a sin in my soul, and him a saint,
but I loved him when he was dead.
Aileen: Och, Denis, will you come away?
There is a great fear -on me.
Denis: No, but do you stay, girl, for it
is the healing we need ;. and us strange in
our wits with a thing that is too great
for us.
Ailne (still speaking in a strange quiet):
And every day the bell that was buried
under the stones would ring and the water
was there for the healing; and me living
my lone and bringing: love to young hearts
when my own heart in me was wanting
only a grave in a quiet place where I
might forget.
Denis : Och, sweet woman.
Ailne (her voice rising passionately) : But,
och, I never knew till you came with a
bold man’s mouth an id set the love kiss on
my lips last night that I was still want-
ing the world and its* ways and the young
things and the mad things that would
make me hurt and destroy. Och, Denis, it
is the flame of seven hells, and them lighted
with red fire, that you are wanting to put
your heart into all the days.
Aileen : Och, Denis, come away.
Ailne ( grown very quiet again) : Children,
there is the well for healing. Will we step
down into the holy waters and wash out
the mad thoughts with the good blessing
of other years?
She moves towards the well. Denis and
Aileen follow, clinging to one another in
fear.
Ailne: It is the madness of a thousand
years and the hope of a great peace.
She goes down into the well and disap-
pears. The others stand watching at a
little distance. Ailne returns as a very old,
frail woman. She totters from the brink
and falls. The bell rings.
Denis : Och, Aileen.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Hona's Tapu.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE was a relic of the Roaring Days, and
by some chance he had got to dis-
coursing on the happenings thereof.
And at last the Roaring relic came to the
matter of Hona and his “tapu.” This was
what he said :
“I was one of the original discoverers.
Me an’ me mates would ’a’ took a fortune
out of it if Hona hadn’t turned dog on us.
Hona had no more manners than a hog.
He was a fair cow.
“There was Munro an’ me an’ long Ike
Striven that came upon it, fossicking behind
the old Maori burial-ground. And it was
rich, too. The stone ran half-a-nounce, a
nounce, nounce-an’-a-half at the first pan-
ning.
“You bet, old Mang’pai went mad.
People was tumbling over each other to
come in on shares, or buy us out. But we
hung on to it. And then old Hona butts
in and busts the show.
“It was his land. The old cove was
mighty sick, up at his kaianga, of toi-toi,
an’ not in the best o’ tempers, neither. And,
when you come to think of it, you can’t
wonder at it. He hadn’t no special cause
to love the pakeha. He’d got a shot through
the ankle down at the Gate Pah, and had
to go limping around like a lame hen. Most
of his land was confiscated after the war,
and, on top of it all, Carson, the surveyor,
had upped and run off with Kupapa, his
youngest and prettiest wife.
“We’d just started to dig out the wealth
in real earnest when down comes 20 or 30
buck Maoris and packs us off, bag an’ bag-
gage. Says Hona, he’s damned if any
plurry pakeha is going to get rich off his
gold when he’s dead, and so he sends for
the tohunga, who arrives at a run.
“Old Hona was coughing his soul out on
the mats, but there was enough devil left
in him to spit out a curse or two and
launch a spell. Him and that medicine-
man fixed us proper. They clapped a per-
petual tapu on the reef. They fixed it
so that if anyone, white or brown, man or
woman, broke, chipped, or even so much as
looked crooked at the stone, the curse would
get them and they’d die, quick and hard.
“I tell you tapu was some power in the
land them times. You couldn’t step out
free for fear o’ treading on some graveyard
or other* tapued up to the neck. The place
was full o’ them. The thing had got its
grip on the whites, too. Not a darned cocky
of the lot but wouldn’t sooner go 10 miles
out of his way than walk upon one o’ the
pesky things. And, by gum, we're not all
got over it yet.
“Of course, we miners bucked. We had a
meeting and talked fight. Spoke of forcing
the Government to declare it an open gold-
field and defy old Ilona. But the chief
was dead by then, an’ the fear of his tapu
was heavy on every man of us. It was
all right so long as there was a crowd. But
it got hold of us singly and flattened us
out.
“The chaps didn’t argue. They dropped
away like one man. and nothing came of all
the talk. The place was hoodooed. No
Maori. could be got within three miles of it
and we whites weren’t too fond of it. Now
and again me an’ Ike would go down, sit
on the next hill and damn Ilona’s eyes, but
we neither of us went no nearer.
“This is where Andy McCallum comes
into the yarn. He was a bullocky from
down Waikonaiti way. He started in to
cart goods from Mangapai to Marsden Point.
A lovely team o’ 14 he worked on the road,
and he wanted ’em, every ounce. Come the
rains, there was places, a mile across, you
couldn’t bottom the mud with a 10ft. pole.
“It was a fine autumn night Andy was
making a trip to the Point. Munro was
a passenger on the box. The road was dry
and hard, the beasts in prime fettle. The
waggon went swinging over the ruts, with
a merry clank and rattle. They’d got to
talking o’ Ilona’s tapu, and Munro said he
was damned if he’d go near it.
“ ‘Hoots! mon,’ said Andy. ‘There’s nae-
thing to it. I’ll gang my ways and tak’ a
crack at the auld staiie.’
“Munro tried to stop him.
“ ‘Havers,’ he said. ‘Bide you with the
team a wee.’
“He fetched a bottle from the locker (there
was always a bottle in Andy’s waggon-
locker), took a pull, and went swinging
down the gully with a spanner in his hand.
“Munro heard the chink-chink of iron on
stone, and in a minute Andy was back with
a chip of quartz in his hand. It was round
and small and shone in the moonlight with
the dull glare of a dead eye. Munro didn’t
like it and got as far from the blamed
thing as the seat would let him and Andy
slipped it into his breeches pocket. But
nothing happened just then. So Munro
called himself several sorts of a fool for
having shown the white feather. And he
had hardly finished doing it when Hona’s
curse got to work.
“They had gone along a matter of six
miles, to where the road breaks into the sand-
hills. Andy was tramping it, beside his
team, calling the beasts by name and sing-
ing. Suddenly the team stopped. The bul-
locks bunched into a mob, tails tucked in
and heads down. They shook with fear ana
moaned. The sweat of terror was wet on
their flanks and the reek of it rose to the
frosty stars. And Andy’s face was like
chalk in the moonlight. It was frozen into
a look of unspeakable terror. He threw
up his arms without a cry. Next instant
he fell in a heap in the road and bullocks
and waggon were away in a mad stampede.
They vanished in a whirl of sand, but Munro
had jumped clear and was down in the
road beside Andy.
“The riot of the stampede brought out a
sleepv cockatoo, and him and Munro carried
Andy half a mile, through a swamp, to the
shanty. Ilis neck was broken, and, round
the throat was the mark of huge strangling
hands. ‘Accident,’ says the Coroner; ‘run
over by a bullock-waggon.’
“Munro told the Coroner he was a blanky
idiot. He said the man had dropped before
the bullocks thought of bolting. The body
lay clear of the wheels by a good 10 feet.
‘Pooh!’ said the Coroner, again. ‘How
comes his neck to be broken if he wasn’t
run over?'
“But what Munro always wanted to know
is—what set those bullocks whimpering with
fright? What set that look on Andy’s face
and the purple marks of fingers on his
broken neck? What did man and beasts
see that he did not, and what sent those
quiet animals on a run that ended only
among the sharks of Ruakaka Bay?
“After that people was more chary of the
place than before. an(l the reef’s never
been worked. There’s been plenty tried
to start a syndicate on it, but. somehow or
’nother, it’s always fell through.
“The only other time I know old Ilona’s
tapu was broke was when Dick the half-
caste chipped a piece off the rock, just for
sheer devilment. Dick had a extra skin-
ful that day, and for no reason at all went
down to ‘preak a pit of Ilona’s planky
stone.’ Him Constable Sheehan an’ me
picked oiit, that same night, from the rushes
in front of Donaldson’s old store that useter
stand in what is now the middle of Whan-
garei town. At first we thought he’d got
’em again, and took him to the lock-up. But
it was more than the jim-jams was the mat-
ter with him. He kicked and twisted in
agerny. His chest heaved and lifted under
our hands. You could see his heart fight-
ing under his bare ribs. He died with a
shriek to Old Ilona to ‘Take your plurry
hand off my heart.’
“ ‘Heart disease,’ says the doctor. ‘Natu-
ral causes,’ says the Coroner. But me an’
Sheehan knew better. We said ‘tapu,’ and
that I holds to still. And if you want
more particulars you can get ’em from
Sergeant-Inspector Sheehan, who’s got it
all sot down in writin’.
“Is the gold in the stone? It is. Would
I work it if you made it worth my while?
I would not. I don’t suppose I’m a bigger
coward than my neighbors. I was out
after Te Kooti an’ took my share o’ the
fighting. But I wouldn't go monkeying with
Ilona’s tapu not for all the gold in the Bank
o’ New Zealan’. And I wouldn’t advise you
to do it, neither.’’
