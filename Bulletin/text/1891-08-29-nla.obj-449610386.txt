BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large - from 100 up to ISO feet frontages, with long depths
thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.

is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal

been applied to any object. In England, even the Cooperative Societies
benefit some millions of persons—their membership exceeding a million and
a-half, and hold invested capital to the amount of eleven millions of money.
This success is owing to the fact that the investor sees not only a fair com-
mercial return on his investment, but a proprietary division of profits, which
he would not receive from any other organisation. It has been left to Aus-

SATURDAY, AUGUST 29, 1891.
The Nomadic Voter, and Other Matters.
Day by day the question of the representa-
tion of the people gets into deeper water in
the New South Wales Assembly. The long
hours of incessant argument over Parkes’
famous Bill have led to nothing but soul-
destroying confusion. The purposes in-
volved in the Bill are sufficiently simple, but
the incurable tendency to spread a few plain
facts into 150 clauses, and to involve them
in a tangled forest of words and deceased
grammar has obscured it past all human
comprehension. What results the Repre-
sentation of the People Bill will ultimately
produce—whether it will develope into a
Land Act or a dog-tax ordinance—can only
be conjectured, but its presumable objects
are as follows : First, to provide that every
adult sane white citizen who is out of
gaol shall be registered as the proprietor of
one vote and one only ; secondly, to provide
that he shall vote only once ; and thirdly, to
ensure that the Legislature shall be elected
by the majority of the votes polled. It is
necessary to define these three purposes, for
the Bill itself explains them so badly
that they are only matters of specu-
lation. Possibly, if that unhappy measure
were illustrated with diagrams, showing the
voter going to the poll, and returning from
it after he has voted, and the returning-
officer counting the votes, and, finally, the
successful candidate making his entry into
Parliament, some light might be thrown on
the darkness, but the Parkes Government,
without illustrations, is incomprehensible.
* # #
The first essential in carrying out the
democratic principle is a definite system
of registration, and this part of the pro-
gramme admits of four distinct alternatives.
The first is a continuance of the present hap-
hazard process, whereby the voter grows on
to the roll rather than arrives there by any
definite method, and the chances for or
against any particular individual being on
the list are about as vague as the chances
for or against the same person being struck
by lightning. Under this plan, the dead
remain on the register till their names fall
off by a gradual process of decay, and no
definite results are ever arrived at. The
second alternative is a rigid system of official
registration, by which every voter shall be
annually inspected and enrolled by a public
official ; this is the device which is supposed
to exist at present in New South Wales, but
which certainly does not and never has
existed. The third alternative is voluntary
registration, whereby any qualified individual
who chooses to apply may have a vote, and
the rest of the nation will stand out; and
the fourth is a compulsory method, under
which every citizen must enrol himself once
a year, or incur a penalty for nonfulfilment
of his duty as a member of the Common-
wealth. fhe objections to all these plans
have been discussed until they are sufficiently
familiar. The first is incurably idiotic and
incomprehensible ; it is a shapeless policy by
which the voter is washed on to the roll bv
the sea of accidents, and remains there till
he is washed off again, and it serves no fixed
or definite purpose whatever. The second
is costly, and can never be made absolutely
efficient, and it leads to a helpless depen-
dence on the State, inasmuch as the citizen
who must have his vote brought round to
his door before he will use it will presently
want his candidate brought round also. The
third is also hopelessly inefficient ; and the
last device of the four is denounced as an
outrage on the liberty of the subject, and a
brutal encroachment upon the rights of man
in general.
* * #
Still the choice practically lies between
the two methods last-mentioned, and of the
two the latter is decidedly the less objection-
able. The system of voluntary registration
has one defect which is absolutely incurable.
The average citizen will always register
under sufficient pressure, and the well-
organised party, with abundance of funds,
which can afford to form committees, and
hire canvassers, agents, and inspectors all
over the province to rally up its supporters,
will invariably get ahead of the party which
has to depend on brains rather than on
money. The old property-vote will be
abolished, but property will remain the
ruling influence none the less, and in em-
bodying this device in his Electoral Act
Parkes has given all due consideration to
the fact that the party of property is his
party, and that any advantage which may be
gained will be Parkes’ own advantage, and
his alone. On the other hand, compulsory
registration would place all parties on an
equal footing. It would be, undoubtedly,
an outrage on the liberty of the subject if
the subject, in this particular sense, had any
liberty to be outraged ; but such liberty is a
tiling of the past, and therefore this objec-
tion is bogus and altogether void. The
liberty of the subject disappeared with the
beginning of civilisation. The law compels
the individual citizen to register himself and
his family, his horses, his agricultural imple-
ments, and all his other property in the
decennial census. It requires him to register
his marriage, the birth of his child, and the
death of any member of his household. It
demands that he shall register his dog,
and it inquires about his income for purposes
of taxation, and it infringes his liberty in the
case of any outbreak of contagious disease in
his family. It keeps him busy, in short,
registering all manner of different things
from the cradle to the grave, and amid so
much compulsory registration one more
registration can make no appreciable differ-
ence. And, by and bye, in all probability,
the law will interfere still further with the
liberty of the subject by making voting also
compulsory. It already tines a citizen when
he refuses to have his head broken by assist-
ing in the arrest of some brawny ruffian
several times his own size, and in the face of
this outrage the other is too insignificant to
be worth objecting to.
# 3F
The abolition of double-voting and per-
sonation is a matter of comparatively little
difficulty. By holding all elections on one
and the same day—this, let no one forget,
is an absolute democratic essential, for a
variety of reasons—double-voting can be
provided against to a very great extent in
country districts, for even the fraudulent
elector, who has, by perjury, obtained an
electoral right in two separate con-
stituencies, will be so efficiently blocked by
the difficulties of transit that deception of
this kind will bo practically extinct. In the
city, on the other hand, where frauds—
electoral and otherwise—have their most
congenial habitat, double-voting can only be
put down by a rigid system of organisation.
The division of the city into single elec-
torates, the subdivision of the electorate
into wards, and of the wards into precincts
—upon the American plan—of two or three
streets each, the multiplication of polling-
booths, and the appointment of delegates
living in each precinct and personally
familiar with its inhabitants to repre-
sent each precinct at its own poll-
ing - booth, will probably meet the
emergency better than any other device.
Then each elector can be identified with
almost certainty by the delegate from his
own precinct—a system which will reduce
the great electoral swindle to the lowest
possible minimum. Moreover, under a
system of compulsory registration and con-
stant supervision there Avill be no dead men
to personate, and by the abolition of the
Sydney graveyard-vote one great element of
fraud will be completely eliminated.
# #
The avowed object of an election is to
secure a Legislature which has been chosen
by an absolute majority of the electors.
Hitherto no such Legislature has ever
existed in New South Wales, and it can
only be secured by live drastic reforms : the
abolition of the property-suffrage, compul-
sory registration and compulsory voting, the
system o.f second ballots, and by the holding
of all elections on one and the same
day. The object of the last-named
measure is partly to make persona-
tion impracticable as already mentioned,
and partly to abolish that peculiar system of
lawful and legitimate political fraud at which
the Parkes Government has proved itself
such an adept. In a general election that
dark and scaly cabinet invariably takes the
vote in the reliable Foreign-trade con-
stituencies first, and places the hostile con-
stituencies at the extreme end of the list.
By this device, it opens the campaign with a
long list of successes and gains valuable
prestige ; it enables its unsuccessful candi-
dates to stand a second or even a third time,
and sets its successful nominees free to
stump the country with garbled statistics
and strange, baseless assertions ; and its
opponents meanwhile come in at the extreme
end of the programme, and, if defeated,
have no second opportunity. This is not
absolute swindling, neither is it bribery and
corruption, nor intimidation, nor any other
indictable offence, but it is an underhand
proceeding which secures the advantages of
all three combined. The object of com-
pulsory voting is to abolish the entire system
of party organisation, whereby the faction
which can spend large sums of money to
whoop up its supporters invariably counts a
largo vote at the polls, and the party which
is short of money does not. For although
open bribery may be practically extinct, solid
coin is still the ruling influence in the State.
The methods by which a party is organised
are lavish advertising, the hiring of expen-
sive orators, the subsidising of newspapers,
the distribution of impassioned printed
addresses, the giving of banquets, and similar
means ; and even a minority which has been
vigorously canvassed by these methods can
generally get ahead of a majority which has
not been aroused to superhuman activity by
any banquets or lavish printing or expensive
oratory, or other outliy of superfluous riches.
Compulsory voting, in fact, is the inevitable
outcome of compulsory registration, and
they arc both the natural concomitants of
the system of election by absolute majorities
and the abolition of plural voting. They
have all one well-defined object—to abolish
not only open fraud and intimidation, but
also the entire system of shuffling, evasion,
official “faking, ’ subterranean engineering,
legalised swindling, and passing on of the
responsibility, and to make the Legislature
represent the absolutely untrammelled
opinion of a definite majority of the nation.
# * *
The objects of a truly democratic Electoral
Act may be summed up in one sentence—to
make all men free and equal. And, by way
of doing this, it is essential to abolish party
organisation, as it is at present understood,
the same being merely an underhand device
whereby one section of the community steals
a march upon and smothers another ; to
abolish plural voting; to establish the system
of second ballots in order to do away with
the nefarious swindle of nominating fraudu-
lent candidates on the enemy’s ticket in
order to split the hostile vote ; and to extin-
guish the equally nefarious, fraud of pro-
tracted elections, which are almost invariably
engineered to suit the convenience of the
party in power. So far the course is
sufficiently simple, and but for the sufficient
fact that Pakkes’ democratic principles are
bogus, and his Liberalism a hollow sham,
the whole matter could have been provided
for in an Act of twenty or thirty clauses.
* * #
The one great difficulty which has so far
proved practically insuperable is that of
dealing with the nomadic voter. In former
times this question was one of small import-
ance. The sailor, the shearer, the pros-
pector, the hawker, the Murrumbidgee
whaler, and other unsatisfactory children
of the wilderness and the sea" were all
individuals without property, therefore the
fact that they had no residential qualification
and no vote was of the very smallest account.
But the Australian democracy is at last
beginning to weary of the reign of bricks
and earth. They realise that every adult
sane white citizen is entitled to vote because
he is a citizen, and not because of his
residential qualification, or any other qualifi-
cation of the same kind—in fact, that the
residential qualification is not the cause of
the vote, but merely a handy means of
identifying the voter. Moreover, the Go-
vernment is always ready to collect taxes
from the seaman, and the shearer, and even
the " whaler —provided it can get them ;
and if ever this country is reduced to dire
straits by foreign invasion the shearer and
the stockman and the “ whaler” and the
others will be swept in by the same levy cn
masse which takes in the affluent inhabitant
with a large stomach, and a “stake ” in the
land. And further, if the seaman'"and the
“ whaler ’ and the rest of the nomads do
little good to the country, they, at least, do
no positive harm, and for that very reason
they are better entitled to- a share in the
Government of the country than the pub-
lican who makes Ids own grog, and the man
with the 60 per slient bank, and the stock-
exchange bird of prey, and many more. But
still the nomadic voter is a problem that is
hard to solve.
* * #
He belongs to no particular constituency,
and is attached to no particular electoral
roll. He can’t be identified, as a rule,
in order to guard against double voting
or personation. It is almost impossible to
find out if he is dead and is being resurrected
for purely party purposes. It is almost
equally hard to ascertain if he was ever
alive, or was merely an, imaginary and bogus
voter from the first, and if he °is
found out, it is another serious problem
how to arrest him and bring him to justice,
seeing that he is a man with no address.
He can’t be traced by bis handwriting, for
he all writes Very much alike, or else makes
a smudgy cross on his ballot-paper. He can’t
be identified by Ids photograph, for he can
give false names, and any name will fit th >
photo, of an unknown man. The system of
compulsory registration will make it neces-
sary to furnish extraordinary facilities f o >.
obtaining electoral rights; and when tin
voter is allowed to register at eveiw
country post-office and police-station, then
the nomad—who can’t be identified— can
take out a fresh electoral right at every town
he visits. And being thus registered as (savt
John Smith of every separate township m
the province, he can next come down to
Sydney, where the constituencies are closely
massed together* and sell his vote by virtue
of fifteen elector’s rights obtained at fifteen
different places, as fifteen separate and indi-
vidual Smiths, and make much hard cash by
the process. Yet it is impossible to crush
out this crime by inflicting a heavy penalty
on any individual found with more than one
electoral right in his possession, for then the
plural voter will be careful not to carry his
multiplicity of voting-tickets about him, and
the person who is convicted of this offence
will be some unhappy individual who has been
hocussed by an enemy, and got his pockets
filled with tickets by some one who desires to
walk out with his best girl while he is in
gaol. In every way the nomad seems to be
an insoluble puzzle. Possibly he might be
arranged on a satisfactory basis if the Return-
ing officer tattooed him blue after he had
voted, as it would then lie impossible for
him to efface the mark in time to vote a
second time at the same election ; but he
would probably object to this simj le and
efficient device. In short, the one absolute
certainty about him is that, being a white
man and a brother, he is entitled to a vote,
but exactly how he is to get it no one knows
just now. But he is going to get it.
“ A Challenge to Premier Parkes.”
The Bulletin has some questions to ask on a
matter of grave Australian interest. In the
first place it wishes to know what are the prin-
ciples which regulate prosecutions for criminal
libel in New South Wales? What is the
distinguishing feature that lifts a defamatory
statement out of the category of civil wrongs,
entitling the injured person to recover damages
in an action, and converts it into an offence
against the community, punishable by the
strong hand of the criminal law ? When does
an assault on a person’s character and reputa-
tion, like an assault with intent to do him
bodily harm, cease to be the private business of
the individual and commence to become the
affair of the State ? Presumably there are
definite rules on the subject, and The Bulletin
would be glad if some person in authority
would state for the information of the public
what they are, In the meantime some infor-
mation may be deduced from the decided cases.
A very short time has elapsed since Reseigh
Martin was criminally prosecuted for a libel
on Mr. Eddy, one of the New South Wales
Commissioners for Railways. The libel was
published in some obscure provincial newspaper
—at this moment we forget the name of it—
and consisted of a repetition of certain rumours
affecting Mr. Eddy, which, though conclusively
disproved by that gentleman, were at the time
undoubtedly current in the city and throughout
the country. The libelled man might, if he
chose, have obtained redress by a civil action
against the author of the article and- the pub-
lisher of the newspaper, who could, had they
failed to pay awarded damages and costs, have
been sent to gaol for a year. He did not take that
course, but a public prosecution was instituted;
Martin was proceeded against by the Attorney -
General in the august name of Her Majesty,
and, being found guilty, was sentenced to two
years’ imprisonment, which he would have
served to the bitter end, had not the Executive
been reluctantly compelled to remit part of the
sentence, in obedience to the overmastering
pressure of public opinion. Now, whatever
may lie the ingredient that is necessary to make
a libel a crime, it must have been present in
the circumstances of that attack against Mr.
Eddy. If Reseigh Martin was a criminal
and a criminal he was adjudged to be then
every individual who acts in the same way,
under similar circumstances, is a criminal, and
should be treated as such.
* # •
In lace of that case, we demand to know why
no steps have been taken by r the authorities
responsible for public prosecutions to bring to
justice the author of the gross, malignant,
and unparalleledly audacious string of un-
doubtedly criminal libels upon the Premier
of New South Wales published in a certain
Sydney newspaper on Sunday week ? Nearly a
fortnight has passed, and idl nothing has been
done, it may be assumed the publication is to
be allowed to pass-unnoticed. We do not chdose
to repeat the statements made about Sir Henry
Parkes, or even to indicate their nature. By
this time they are quite sufficiently public pro-
perty. Whether they are true or not we do
not know ;we do not now care to know. All
we do want to know is why, since Martin was
declared to be a criminal, and was punished as
a criminal, other criminals of the same type are
not treated in the same way ? Are we to sup-
pose that it was to satisfy some private grudge
that Martin was picked out and made a scape-
goat ? What is the secret that gains other
wrongdoers this invidious immunity ? Hoav are
wc to account for the fact that the Attorney-
General who rigorously prosecuted Reseigh
Martin allows John Norton to go scot free ?
* * *
Shall we be asked to believe the old, old
story that the members of the Parkes Govern-
ment do not read the newspapers ? Is the
publication in question too obscure to have
come' under the notice of the authorities ? Or,
will it be said that its obscurity palliates the
offence, and makes it too contemptible for the
law to take notice of ? That explanation is no
longer admissible. The paper boast a that it has
a circulation of 28,000 a week. The paper that
libelled Mr. Eddy was a petty country
sheet, usually only heard of in its own


little districts If the range of dissemination of
the slander is a material clement in the case,
then tli is offence is a thousand times more
heinous than the one for which Martin suffered.
Yet, no notice is to be taken of it. Who, we
ask, is responsible for this glaring display
of favouritism ? It would be intolerable,
it is hardly conceivable, that the caprice
or partiality of the law-officers of the
(Jrown should determine whether a given act is
to bo treated as a mere harmless peccadillo or as
a grave crime. To justify their action in
Martin’s case and their inaction in this, they
must clearly show an essential distinction
between the two. We challenge them to point
to any distinction that is not overwhelmingly in
Martin’s favour. Will they say that the alle-
gations made about Sir Henry Parkes are less
serious than those which brought the criminal
law to Mr. Eddy’s aid ? Reseigh Martin was
sent to a country gaol in irons. Had he said of
Mr. Eddy what this paper says of Sir Henry
Parkes, then, if the punishment had been pro-
portioned to the nature of the libel, no dungeon
in the country could be found deep enough —the
sacred relics of the palmiest days of the old
convict system could not supply irons weighty
enough —to make the scales hang even in the
hands of outraged j ustice. The article is one long
series of the most slanderous imputations, con-
veyed not by innuendo, not in ambiguous terms
capable of being explained away, but with
deliberate, explicit, categorical, circumstantial
audacity, coupled with an insolent challenge to
the Premier to take either civil or criminal
proceedings !
* * *
By way of justifying the prosecution of the
libeller of the New South Wales Commissioner
for Railways, it was urged that it was essential
to the due discharge of high public functions
that the officer entrusted with them should be
shielded by law from unwarranted attack. The
position occupied by Mr. Eddy was so exalted
and honourable that his character was a matter
of national concern. To impeach the honour
and integrity of so distinguished a public ser-
vant was to make an assault upon the body
politic and cast a slur upon the commonwealth.
That was why Reseigh Martin was pursued as
a criminal offender—not to redress Mr. Eddy’s
personal grievances, but to punish a wrong that
had been done to the State. Well, is Sir
Henry Parkes’ character a matter in which
the people of New South Wales have no
interest? Is he too insignificant and obscure
to come within the official cognisance of
the Attorney-General? Why, is he not at this
moment the most conspicuous figure in the
land; the Grand Old Man of the continent,
the doyen of our representative institutions, the
father of the coming federation, the George
Washington of his counti’y, the man whom
Her Majesty has been graciously pleased to
raise to high honour, a magnate of a knightly
order, a prospective Privy Councillor, the
first of an impending creation of Australian
peers! He.is more than all this: he is the
Premier of New South Wales, the chosen leader
of a great section of the Australian nation.
Is the head drayman of the province, the
manager of the public parcel delivery, to be
put on a higher pedestal than the man who
stands at the head of the country, who for all
representative purposes, is the country, who is
accepted all over the world as the country?
.Shall the State upraise itself in all the grandeur
of outraged majesty to crush the miscreant who
dares to utter a depreciatory word of Mr. Eddy,
and sit with a vacant smile of supercilious un-
concern while Sir Henry Parkes is spat upon
and trampled in the dust ? Again we ask, why
is this particular publication treated with this
.marked deference and consideration ? Why
:should one man be served as a felon and
.sent to herd . with felons for repeating
iin a back-block fly sheet with a limited
local circulation, rumours which, though
■absolutely without foundation, were in many
men’s mouths, affecting the character of a
subordinate official, while a metropolitan paper
is allowed, with impunity, to fling the vilest
charges with brazen defiance in the teeth of the
personage who fills the highest office that the
counti'y can bestow and to scatter its foul
slanders all over the world ?
# # *
It may, perhaps, be said that Sir Henry
Parkes prefers to take the magnanimous course
■of ignoring this attack. As to that, we may
;say, in the first place, that we do not put over-
much trust in the gentleman’s magnanimity.
■Some time ago another Sunday paper, conducted
(by Edward Eleis, so far forgot itself as to
make damaging reflections on the present
Premier. No steps were taken against the
paper directly, but the city police promptly
began a ruthless raid on the little boys selling
it in the streets; and musty, disused, ante-
diluvian statutes were resurrected for the
special behoof of the desperate young ruffians.
We accept implicitly the statement that the
Premier and the then Government had no part
in those proceedings, and that the coincidence
of the sudden back-handed persecution of the
journal in question at the moment when it com-
menced to say nasty things about the head of
the Government was due solely to .Sab-
batarian zeal of an officious constable. Never-
theless, we do not adopt the magnanimity
theory with any heartiness. Further, we say
that it has nothing to do with the matter. This
is a criminal offence we are talking about; and
when a man becomes amenable to the criminal
law, the course of justice should not be dis-
turbed by the magnanimity of any individual.
•So far as Sir Henry Parkes is personally con-
cerned—his right to recover damages for the
injury done to his reputation —we have nothing
to say That is distinctly bis own business.
He is entitled to put what value he chooses on
bis own fame and character. He may consider
that they stand too high to lie damaged by any
traducer ; it may be that he shrinks, as a man
of his age pardonably might, from the expense
and annoyance of an action at law ; it may be
that in a spirit of pure, generous Christian for-
bearance he is willing to forego his remedy.
Let that be so. That does not affect the duty
of the Attorney-General to set in motion the
machinery provided by the Constitution for the
repression and punishment of gross, flagrant,
find undisguised violations of the haw.
Tiie. Bulletin does not desire to sail under fa 1 s 3
colours in this matter. It would be a thrice
transparent affectation for us to pretend that we
were actuated by any strong feeling of regard
for Sir Henry Parties. Our sentiments
towards Sir Henry Parties are pretty well-
known ; we have been at no pains to conceal
them. We have no love for him, personally or
politically. The influence that he has exercised,
and is likely to exercise, on the destinies of
this country, we look upon as being almost
entirely for evil. If a word from us would dis-
miss him from power, and banish him utterly
and for ever from public life, we would speak
that word, not only without compunction, but
with a sense that we were discharging a sacred
duty and conferring a lasting obligation on
N.S. Wales and the whole of Australia. We
have not the hypocrisy now to pose as his
champion. If he feels aggrieved by what has
been said about him, he, with the machinery of
government in his hands, is perfectly well able
to take steps to right himself without the
assistance of The Bulletin. What leads us to
interfere in the matter is not that a slander has
been uttered against Sir Henry Parkes, but
that a slander has been uttered against the
highest dignitary of the State, anti through
him against the State itself. Australia is being
disgraced by the perpetration of a criminal
offence right under the nose of Attorney -
General Simpson.
* * *
What possible excuse can the Attorney-
General have for neglecting what, under the
circumstances, is his obvious duty ? What are
his colleagues about to allow him to neglect it ?
It cannot be that they consider the charges
made against their chief too unimportant to
warrant notice. Would Mr. G. B. Simpson
allow the same statements, if made concerning
himself, to go unanswered and unpunished ?
Would Mr. Bruce Smith? Would Mr.
Brunker? Would Mr. Suttor ? Would any
other member of the Ministry? If not, why
should they permit them to go unchallenged
when made about Sir Henry Parkes? It
would be insulting to ask if they suppose that
the statements could possibly be true. It
would be an insult to the Premier, an insult
to the province of which he is Premier,
and an insult to the members of the
ministry themselves. We repeat that we know
nothing about the truth of the statements, and
desire to know nothing. It is at present none
of our business. It is the Attorney-General’s
business, and he has given and continues daily
to give the clearest and most unmistakable
denial to every word of the whole calumnious
tirade, a denial expressed in the most-emphatic
manner by his presence in the ministry of
which Sir Henry Parkes is the head. No one
would dare to suggest that Mr. George Simp-
son, and the other gentlemen of high character
we have named, would remain for a single day
associated with a man of whom such things
could be even reasonably conjectured. it
must be taken, then, that the charges are as
false as they are cruel and malicious, and in
that case the individual who has made them
is a dastardly scoundrel on whom mercy would
be thrown away. The precedent we have cited
shows conclusively that he is also in the eyes of
the-law a criminal, and this on the authority
of the Attorney-General himself, backed Tip by a
judgment of the N.S. W. Supreme Court. It is a
crime to which is allotted a heavy penalty. W e
wish, therefore, to know —and the country has
aright to know—what mighty influence there
is in the background, paralysing the arm of the
law, and sheltering this particular criminal
from the punishment which he so insolently
and defiantly invites ?
Colston, Insanity and Deterrents.
Dear Bulletin, —Colston has been hanged 1
And considering his execution from a logical
standpoint, he must be regarded as, in the first
place, a victim to an outworn, rough-and-ready
and uncivilised and unscientific law; and, in the
second, to an ill-digested and blundering defence.
His counsel endeavoured to prove that the
unfortunate man was suffering from a mental
disease physically discernible, rendering him
in point of fact idiotic ; whilst the testimony of
experts, and Colston’s own intelligent conduct,
bear witness to his possession of sufficient
reason to enable him to judge between what is
conventionally regarded as right and wrong.
All his actions show that, so far from being in
the least degree insane, he had the fullest com-
mand of his faculties, and any effective defence
of his life should therefore have been based on
an absolutely different ground—that he was the
victim not of hopelessly diseased perception
but of irresistible impulse. Had the facts of
the case, with due emphasis upon all the
extenuating circumstances, been placed un-
reservedly before the jury, their finding of
Colston’s guilt might, supposing them to be
possessed of reasonable intelligence, have re-
ceived as a rider a strong recommendation to
mercy with a fair expectation of such
recommendation being seconded by the presiding
Judge, whose remarks on the hearing of the
appeal show him to be seized of the illogicalness
of the present legal definition of insanity. The
Executive would probably have favourably con-
sidered such a recommendation, based, as it
might have been, on sufficiently extenuating
circumstances, and spared Colston the final
office of the law.
# # #
As might have been the defence
broke down utterly. The whole question,
indeed, turns upon the legal and social
definition of crime, and—on parallel lines
the legal and social definition of insanity.
No doubt, when' Colston committed the crime,
exasperated though he may have been to the
extremest, he was just as insane as any other
man who has committed, or may commit, a
crime of like nature. It is not a question
whether the individual criminal is insane at the
time of committing a crime, so much as whether
every man who commits such a crime is not in-
sane. Nay, more, whether every man who has
committed no crime whatever, may not have
already deeply implanted within him the germ
which may, under certain conditions, not of his
own making, blossom into crime—and insanity.
For, looked at in a broad way, all crime is in-
, anity, and conversely till insanity is crime.
Samuel Butler is no paradoxist when, in his
“ Erevvhon,” Lo makes his ideal community
punish with dreadest Draconism all forms of
physical disability, and likewise with tenderest
solicitude all forms of dangerous scoundrelism
and direst villainy. The criminal is a sick
man. Havelock Ellis, in “The Criminal,”
treats the sinner purely as a product, an atavistic
monster, a throwback to the virtues of a past
age. Ellis’s social enormities stalk through
his pages as approximations in a latter day to
the heroes of the Homeric cycles. He doesn’t
belong to us—the criminal—he is an abnormal
type, out of the modern running, the blood
brother of the genius and the lunatic, and like
geniuses and lunatics deserving of a special
treatment and a special code of morality. Men
commit crime because they mmt, and until
society recognises this fact all criminal'‘juris-
diction must perforce be tentative and purely
expedient. Every year the statistician submits
undeviating tables forecasting the total of
drunkards, suicides, murderers, and people who
trill post unaddressed letters. These things
follow natural laws. There is little appreciable
divergence —yet we hang Colston to prevent
other Colstons from doing likewise !
». * *
It is a mere matter of moral cowardice. We
are afraid to accept the conclusions of that very
Science we are so prone to laud. M e
build inebriate asylums for confirmed
drunkards because we recognise that the
drunkard is a “patient.” We have not yet
advanced far enough to desist from punishing
attempted suicides because we are as yet too
slow to accept the conclusions of our own logic
to recognise that the suicide—who evades all
moral and social obligations in a spirit of appa-
rent egotism because he must —is also a
“ patient. ” By and bye we will do this. Then
the murderer’s day will come, when he, too,
will meet with a hospital and a doctor—instead
of a gallows and a hangman. It is merely a
question of logical acceptance of conclusions,
logically arrived at from premises logically laid
down. To-day, due doubtless to a spurious
revival of gallantry opposed to a Woman’s
Rights agitation, we dare not hang a woman.
We present a gloved hand instead of a hempen
necklace to the abortionist, and Mrs. Taylor
(who was to have been Colston’s gallows-mate,
and who, it is safe to say, has, for mere money,
committed a hundred deliberate crimes as
compared with Colston’s one dark deed
of uncontrollable and unsordid impulse)
laughs at the gallows, because a petticoat
hanging from a clothes-line shocks, not our
humanity, but our aesthetic sense. This may
lie hailed as progress ! Bah ! It is only a
resurrected form of an anthropoid belief in
woman as Property, and it is looked upon as
sinful to injure property :—a woman, therefore,
doesn’t pendulate ! A man is nobody’s property
but his own (and his landlord’s) ( Alston hangs;
It is time we looked the situation squarely in
the face. There are two types of criminals.
There are two types of crimes. And punish-
ment prevents neither ! There is the crime
which Springs from the possession of too much
virtue —social virtue, which rests on the instinct
of solidarity—which impels a man to violence
because all his powers and energies revolt
against iniquity exercised in opposition to all
that is most sacred to his emotions as a member
of a race with emotions worth preserving. To
prevent this man from so-called crimes of
violence you must first corrupt him —lover
his standard of virtue —punishment is here
powerless. There is next the instinctive
criminal, the horn criminal, the man who is no
good and who doesn’t know it, for his badness
is the goodness of a past age. The only attempt
of a scientific nature ever put in operation to
eradicate the inherent vice in him is in America,
and that at the Elmira prison. There is no
good in the world pooh-poohing the treatment.
Facts are too eloquent! The returns for further
treatment of prisoners, discharged from the
Elmira prison college, show only 1") per cent,
out of over 2000 discharges. The system is
eminently practical. It is based on the most
scientific principles. It recognises the atavistic
criminal, and it rushes his intellectual develop-
ment over gaps which would be bridged only
by centuries of slow social educational torture,
if he were returned to Society as ignorant
an animal as when he entered the peni-
tentiary college. Here is a fact, and any
community which evades its consideration is
cowardly and illogical. The Elmira experiment
has proved that education can- cure crime. If
one form of crime, why not every form —pro-
vided the crime is instinctive and not emo-
tional? Hospitals are open to the drunkard;
inebriety is no longer regarded as a sin. Theft
is even sagely pondered over as kleptomania
when the area-thief wears a coronet. By-and-
bye, we will accept our responsibilities. Mean-
while, Colston hangs and the Law in hanging
him commits, through sheer ignorance, a cold-
blooded assassination. — Wyong.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Old Cargo Boat.
The Australian sailor has no vote. Therefore,
he is of no earthly use to any member of
Parliament, and no member of Parliament cares
one single straw whether he is alive or dead,
and no Legislature troubles about his existence.
He is an unsatisfactory nomad, drifting hither
and thither on a troubled sea, and his life is of
no account to anybody at all. When he travels
on a passenger steamer he is in tolerable safety,
for the passenger steamer carries the politician,
and the politician's uncle, and other valuable
properties, and, therefore, it is subjected to a
regular half-yearly inspection by a Government
surveyor. But no politician ever travels by
the old, superannuated cargo steamer or sailing
hulk, and, therefore, that vessel is never in-
spected, and the only limit to its unspeakable
rottenness is the limit at which a crew
becomes unobtainable. The cargo boat is
generally a passenger vessel which has been
run into the last stage of dccrcptitudc,
and when the steitiner has become mangy
and crippled, and foundered on all its
extremities, it is just about fit for its new
career of usefulness. Then it is stripped of all
its life-saving apparatus, and every obstruction
which occupies space that might be otherwise
turned to account is removed and sold. The
oldest and most unsaleable boat is left for use
in conveying lines to the wharf, and one or two
life-buoys, which are frayed and busted and
unmarketable, remain on the bridge, to lend an
air of plausibility to the groaning hulk which
ploughs wearily through the heaving sea. The
boat will not hold one quarter of the crew,
and the alleged life-buoy will hold nothing
at all, but the insurance-policy, at least,
is sound and water-tight. Then the
aged craft probably enters into the coal-
trade, and plods surreptitiously by night
along the coast between Sydney and the
southern ports. She loads up during the day,
and her ponderous cargo is shot into her until
it towers high above her hatches, and her decks
are cumbered with coal, and there is coal every-
where from stem to stern. Then, in the dusk,
she coughs wearily away on her six or eight
hours’ run, and with the first gleam of dawn
she wheezes unobserved into Sydney Harbour,
and thus escapes the unpleasant comment
which she might otherwise arouse. This is
what happens if the weather is fine ; if it is not
fine, she runs dejectedly for the nearest shelter,
and if there is no shelter available she wallows
miserably like a waterlogged wreck amid
the waves. Then a few breakers roll over
her and pour into her Open hatchways,
and she goes down, and the owners collect
the insurance, and the public get up a relief
fund. Also the Marine Board finds upon
enquiry that the dead captain should have had
the hatches on, and no one mentions that if he
had the hatches on he couldn’t have carried
nearly so much coal, and if he hadn't carried
the coal he would, have been sacked. Also,
nobody takes any steps to insure that the live
captains, whose time for foundering hasn’t yet
come, have their hatches on, or that the owners
allow them to have them on. Further, it is
generally remarked that the dead and gone
vessel was deficient in live-saving apparatus,
but nobody does anything to the owners who
failed to supply the apparatus, or provides that
other cargo boats shall be better furnished in
this respect. For, as already mentioned, the
sailor is a nomad without a vote, and his fate is
nobody’s funeral but his own.
The other day the death of a Freetradc sup-
porter made a gap in the New South Wales
Assembly, and Pakkes shoved through a
pathetic resolution regretting “the loss which
this House has sustained ” by the decease of
Mr. Ritchie. Last year two Protectionist
members died and left two vacant seats in the
Legislature, and Pakkes didn't move worth a
cent that the House had sustained “ a loss
in their case. They were both men of some
note : Hakoed Stephen and James Feetcheu.
But Pakkes didn't even assume the outward
semblance of respect ■ to either of them.
Pakkes’ great ambition is to be mistaken for
Headstone, but he resembles him not even in his
collar. W hen Bea<'onseieed died, Gladstone
pronounced a funeral oration on the dead man
in the Commons; and Beaconsei eld, despite his
garish jewellery and the green velvet pants of
his younger days, would have done the same
had the positions reversed. So would almost
everybody else—except Pakkes. His grief
about Ritchie was only an election war-whoop.
The deceased member was about the dullest
politician in the House, and with his three
colleagues he made up the dullest, dreariest,
and most arid quartette in all New South W ales.
He was a decent, honourable man. but he was
not a loss in any political sense ; the House
wanted to lose him —not by death, but in any
other way that he could begot rid of. Pakkes’
hollow' note of melancholy imposed on nobody.
It was all empty. He had got measured for his
grief, and the thing was made to order.

Among the half-dozen or so of banks and alleged
banks which have burst mysteriously witlun
the last few weeks in various parts of Australia
there is one characteristic which seems to turn
up every time—the reserve fund can't be found.
Every bank that breaks has a reserve fund, but
it always seems to be kept in some place where
no one can get at it when it is w anted. Most
of the defunct institutions paid a big dividend
at last balance, and carried a large sum to the
said “reserve,” but either they forgot the
bearings of the place they carried it to, or else
the road is too dreadfully uphill for it to be
carried back again, for it never seems to get
back in rime to do any service. Why they all
keep these funds in such an inaccessible spot
has never been explained. A very small amount
hidden in a pair of old boots under the counter
would have saved several institutions which
have come to grief with a gigantic amount of
“ undivided profits ” glaring out of the balance-
sheet, but it never happened to be there. The
whole banking system seems to want revision.
There ought to be a black-tracker in every
bank to get on the trail of the protit-and-loss
account when it is wanted ; or else the reserve
fund should be abolished altogether, and the
general manager should simply keep a £lO,OOO
Government debenture concealed in his ear tor
use in emergencies. The present scheme is of
no earthly good.
“Hanging Judge” Hawkins : “Whether
punishment by the lash ought to be inflicted at
all in this country (England) is matter for the
gravest doubt.” From such a quarter, this is
satisfactory.
The usual board has been appointed by
the Victorian Government to apportion the reward
which was offered for the capture of Colston.
Presumably Colston himself won't get any of it.
though, to all outward appearance, he is entitled
to the whole lot. The way ho was “captured”
was very simple: he walked into a public-house
and explained to a man who was standing at the
bar that he was the famous murderer, and was
ready to be run in. Then the man ran for a
policeman, and had to bring him along by mam
force, because the officer persisted in regarding
the whole affair as an idiotic hoax. The only
person who did any capturing was Colston him-
self, for he had actually to go out and catch a
citizen and explain matters to him before he
could get himself comfortably arrested. 1 ’rider
these conditions, where does the reward come in ?

Biii Macquarie-street North, Sydney, August 26,1891.
-‘>h Dear Moorabinda, —
The Jerseys seem to have been carrying on rather un-
accountably during their sojourn in the back regions. At
the Broken Hill festivities, for instance, Lord Jersey
amiably ukased that full dress wasn’t a crying necessity,
as a man who is worth meeting in his Sunday clothes is
just as well worth meeting in moleskin pants, &c. (alas !
for the dress-coat procession up Bridge-street in the hot
noontide on “levvy” days!) while Lady Jersey wished it
to he understood that at her receptions no style of dress
would be de rigueur 1 Now, this was quite too sweet of
M. E. Jersey, of course, but altogether superfluous, don’t
,rou think? For instance, when has the vice-regal lady
mandated what clothes her she-subjects are to put on
when they “pay their respects to M’Guinness?” The
public Governor publicly orders “frills on” for his
levees because man is a non-dressy animal who would
turn up in a flannel shirt at a wedding if he wasn’t closely
watchcd, but woman is altogether different, and can be
relied upon to wear her entire wardrobe whenever occa-
sion offers. The Broken Hill lady is probably as nicely
arrayed as lots of the women who crOw'd public receptions
in Sydney (I have in my mind’s eye whole miles of shabby
frocks, rainbow colours, and burnt straw hats) and if she
is dressed any worse it is only another phase of aesthetic
suffering of the vice-regal lady—that is all. Probably the
female population of Broken Hill is now seized with the
notion that Sydneyites turn up in feathers and bare
shoulders and carriages at Lady J.'s social afternoons !
they have perhaps never seen the long file of weird
females in every possible variation of rag-bag finery
making mournfully up the drive to Govingment House.
Sydney lie-unions held their last hop but one at Niths-
dale on 18th inst., with Hardy at the piano and twelve
valseson a card of fifteen dances ! It seems a pity that
some people were not born teetotums. The dressing was
very pretty. A tall girl in heliotrope silk plainly made
with corsage cluster of violets ; Miss Benson, in white
Greek gown with bands of gold tinsel; a bank-manager’s
wife from Bathurst looked well in black, but another fair
girl, in black, had unwisely trimmed herself all down the
back of her skirt with natural wattle. No true Australian
likes to see our flora sat upon.
And this reminds me that Lady Jersey, in her latest
pomelets, speaks of the wattle in a joyous connexion.
Her Ex., it is plain, is still a new-chum. The wattle, as
Australia knows, is never associated with joy or cheerful,
ness, but only with death and misery—with the dingo
howling o’er a grave in the lonely bush and the midnight
mopehawk hooting by the black and foetid marsh.
There are palpable orthographical frills over other
names than Smijthe. “ Major W. D. Benny Tailyour” is
the label of the man appointed to succeed Col. De VVolski
as military grand panjandrum in N.S.W. Tailyour?—
Taylor 1 Mem. : Baker—Bakyour !
Things were vice regal at the Garrick Theatre on 18th
inst.—Lord and Lady Jersey and a daughter in red and
gold frock, backed up by a trio of aides in scarlet
facings, sat in the centre of the circle, with their adorers
around them by the cab-load. Lady J. (she has com-
menced to applaud on a level with her nose cl la hubby)
looked weary—all along of her poetical endeavours, no
doubt—and wore a white lace gown trimmed with crinkled
bands of narrow white satin ribbon, the bodice spangled
in gold; diamond and pearl necklace and immense
managerial bouquet (the shape of a small parasol) w hich
she held all the time, “ The Idler ” revival filled the bill,
Olga Nethersole gasping in the same gowns she w ore as
Lady Harding last year. By the way, Olga’s make-up in
the last act-scene had rather a ghastly aspect—her lovely
countenance produced the effect of a well-flowered
dumpling waiting for the pot, and I also must lift up a
still small voice at the way she w-agged her head at the
last exit. Cartwright’s Idler was the same ugly spark
with black and white striped morals as of yore, but I
didn’t like his picking up Nethersole’s dropped handker-
chief in the final act, with the actions of an epileptic and
the superfluous saying, “Cherchez la femme.” There is no
need to “cherchez” in the “ Idler,” because she pervades
the whole show- besides which Cartwright mispronounces
his French.
The w inter is virtually over, and looking back one can’t
help wondering why it is so many dinner-giving women
have their drawing-rooms cosy and flrelit while the
dining-room grate is filled up w ith cold coral and clammy
ferns, or something else equally cheerless, and the guests
are consumed with a wild longing to warm their frozen
fingers on the hot plates. Certainly the menu warms you
when it gets inside—but how about the chilly interval
preceding “Soup, sah”?
One of the most interesting sights on the evening of a
swell ball in Sydney is to see the carriages rolling up
with mamma and the girls inside and the old man shiver-
ing on the box next to the coachman. There is generally
plenty of interior space for papa if they squeezed up a
little, but, then, airy skirts mustn’t be scrunched, and so
he has to go aloft with only an alpaca top-coat between
his laundried buzzum and a howling westerly. Now r ,
isn’t it rather a G x 4 insight into the disposition of a
young woman when she sets her sire up in the teeth of
the gale, braving pneumonia in order that her tulle train
may have a seat to itself?
With a certain amount of trepidation I learn that the
newest fashion in dresses is that they will be made with a
form of waist-belt, or a girdle, encircling the figure a
degree lower than the waist. In short, the Bernhardtian
cestus is going to rage, and no matter how unfitted by
nature a woman may be to assume such a girthing,
nothing will stop her from hooping up like a barrel, even
though slip is fat and forty and outlined accordingly. A
belt a “dej(»fec lower than the waist” is a fearsome addi-
tion to any figure except the slim, straight one—Bern
hardt was too podgy to attempt one. When she thrust
heg jewelled thumbs into each side of that cestus and
turned her profile on to her adorers in front—well, some
people used to call it the “ cherubic,” which is after all
only the poetic phrase for something over-fed.
Sir Alfred Stephen (89 years of age on 20th inst.) some-
times entertains Ins friends by reciting yards of verse
learnt long years ago—epitaphs, and so on. Sir Alfred, I
am told, has given a medical member of the Legislative
Council the original MS. of his recent article in answer to
Mr. Gladstone in the Pall Mall Gazette.
Talking about the four “ Royal ” books kept under
glass at the Victorian Public Library, Sydney suffers simi-
larly', for at the library at Government House a group of
Victoria’s literary efforts are neatly' ranged in a
little glass box which is carefully locked all the time.
Why, goodness knows, for surely nobody ever was known
to want to read them.
If there is anything at all in old superstitions, December
ought to feel his y'oung heart die within him since hi 8
marriage with May' has been postponed owing to the
death of his son—retat Jifty-une\ By the way, the son
only married once and is dead—the sire is verging on the
eighties and amorously courting No. 3. Can marriage be
a failure ?
The third bride of a cracked Sydney solicitor (now
gathered to his fathers) who lived on a gloomy estate on
the shores of the South Pacific had a lively time of it
between the old man and the family vault wherein were
ranged her two predecessors. The vault was on the pre-
mises in a damp, dark spot shaded by cypress, and he
used to take her for a stroll to it after tea, and they
would perch on the ledge and chat about the dead women
underneath with the boom of the surf in their ears and
the sombre bush around them. It is needless to say that
the bride made another in the sarcophagus ere tire year
was out; anti probably found it quite cheerful.
Apropos of the Brisbane season with “Dr. Bill,’ Myra
Kemble tells of meeting a parson who pursed up a reprov-
ing lip on hearing that she was an actress. Nevertheless,
he begged her to go and hear him preach. “Willingly,”
said she, “ provided you will come and see me act.” And
he did, occupying a stage-box, and shrinking out of sight
of the audience - which didn’t suit Myra, who sent to say'
that unless he sat where the house could see him she
wouldn’t go to church. The good man obeyed the mis-
chievous command, and sat in the middle of the box,
w ith the result that Myra’s little brass button tinkled into
the collection-bag on the Saw bath.
The 21st inst. was Arbor Day'in N.S.W., and whole
battalions of combed-up infants were out manoeuvring in
the open with spades and watering-pots, though the local
board ladies did most of the planting, w hile the brats had
the inestimable advantage of watching them spitting
themselves, in what John L. Sullivan would call the
“ bread-basket,” with the handle of the spade. The
Jerseys (deafened with shrieks of patronage from the
metropolitan schools) settled the question by going to the
Liverpool demonstrations, taking their two daughters
(unexpectedly ; as a consequence, the two bouquets in-
tended for the board ladies had to be graciously given to
the girls instead): they' were accompanied by the leading
members of the Public School Board, headed by Minister
Carruthers and his wife. There is really no need to
specify what form the ceremonies took.
Sydney Suburban Bicycle Sports, at the Association
Ground on 22nd, were favoured with a large attendance
and a really spring day. Yet the lawn and in the
members’ stand, chaos had come. To catalogue the
clothes, which had a soothing appearance, a cornflower-
blue gown trimmed with black lace and silver braid,
black lace hat tricked out with cornflowers, was really
the most up to date, but I also liked pale-grey figured in
circles with gauntlet cuffs and collar of grey bengaline ;
grey lace hat trimmed with scarlet flow'ers; tan colour
with sleeves, flounce and basque of black lace ; hat with a
bow of pink chiffon; and a neat green gown with
edgings of narrow gold cord, flat hat in black and green.
To enumerate the number of dresses I didn’t like would
fill a page. You always have to wait for the September
races to see what the Spring will really bring forth in a
frocky way.
One thing always strikes me in the meteoric sassiely
actress, which is that the hint of the woman is always
stronger than that of the dressmaker. You never see a
tailor-built “star” buttoned up from neck to waist in
rigid tweed like a boy’s suit, no matter how modish it is to
resemble a fretwork figure, because there isn’t enough
scope in such a rig to cast a glamour over even the stage-
boxes. Half the “ charm ”of the beauteous creature lies
in the subordination of her drapery, which is made part
of her, revealing more than it conceals—hopelessly out of
fashion, of course, yet leaving the woman paramount.
And this is why the “society gal,” though she painfully
memorises airs and graces, cannot be quite so seductive
because her first agonised query' always is “ What is going
to be worn ? ”
Weigal’s august fashion-journal contains as a novelty
the panier skirt—which can’t very well be the rage until
improvers reign again, as a fullness over the hips and
none at the back looks decidedly funny. Terretted
basques are still designed fashionable, and the fan-shape
is the latest for the back of the skirt—in the gospel
according to Weigal, whose sketch of a “drawing-room
arrangement ” is like a swell-barber’s dream of bliss.
From time to time I have longed to get into a tobacco-
concert ; I have resented the barriers of smoke which
interposed between melody and me, and I have pictured
all sorts of fun for the happy people inside. But a
sufferer tells me a sad tale. “ If,” said he, “the audience
were compelled to smoke the same brand of tobacco, these
concerts, saving that you can’t sec the platform for
smoke, would be well enough. It is true that the
singers nearly cough their heads off, and somebody
always strikes a wax match just as the tenor of the even-
ing is modulating his top A. But that’s nothing. It’s the
mix of a dozen brands of tobacco that makes you reach
for your hat.”
I have received, presumably from a lady, some of the
“Rita Curling Fluid’’—done up in a very professional
bottle, and accompanied by diagrams. But, after all,
cheap cold water acts just as well (with a little soap in
obstinate cases) as the fluid, which is merely to damp the
hair with ere torturing it round pins. What the female
community hungers for is a harmless decoction which
will frizzle their amaranthine bangs in one act.
No woman, say s a fashion paper (in effect), who cares a
pin about her appearance will ever go out without a veil.
Now, I calmly submit that veils are hampered by more
inartistic drawbacks than any other feminine fal-lal.
Watch a woman in a tulle fall getting through her lunch
at a cafe l . She must turn it up over her nose, when—
especially if it is dark-coloured—it gives an ugly divided
look to the prettiest face ; besides, it comes down at
inopportune moments and gets among the soup, and
when you have finished feeding and go to fix it in a kill-
ing way, there comes a crinkled grease-spot just on (he
tip of your nose, and the only alternative left you is to
take it off or go home. Also in paying calls a veil is
utterly aggravating. If you want to hypocritically kiss
your hostess’s last baby or sip your tea in deadly earnest,
that filmy rag has to be hauled up and disarranged, and,
as a result, you go away with a sort of beard of draggled
tulle where once was a crisp straight line. And I never
yet saw a woman who could hook her veil over her nose
with one hand and accept a cup of tea with the other
without looking eagerly greedy somehow.
110 is an irascible old gentleman at the best of times,
and he lives at Hand wick. Last Saturday night he took
his wife into town to hear the organ-recital, leaving his
16-year-old daughter and a young lady friend to mind
house. After the departure of the old people, the girls
started to make toffee, and there being no fire in the
kitchen, they brought their materials and so on into
the dining-room, and the ingredients were soon sizzling
merrily over the blaze. The molten toffee had just been
poured into a fiat pan when, horror, the latch-key was
heard in the front door, and the frightened girls had only
time to shove saucepan and toffee under the table, when
in marched pa and ma. They w ere amongst the thousands
turned away from the Town Hall. I’a, grumpier even
than usual, took off his boots and yelled for his slippers,
but, awaiting their arrival, he bad the ill-luck to draw up
to the table, and, putting his legs under the mahogany,
he plumped both feet into the boiling sugar. You should
have heard pa howl.
St Australian civilians may well stand aghast, don't you
think, at the manner in which moneyed Australian girls
devote themselves exclusively, even unto matrimony, to
the worship of uniforms? Hardly one girl with a red
cent to her father’s name has of late married anybody
but a naval officer or an amateur soldier—for we cannot
regard as real soldiers the expensive Australian regular,
whose sword has never cut anything more ferocious than
a wedding-cake.
"The dress-fabrics for spring, whether in silk or muslin,
carry huge floral decorations to such an extent that
they look like wall-paper. However, nobody need feel
surprised. Woman has long been painted. Now she is to
be papered as well.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
British Postmaster-General Raikes’death is
cabled. He was an exceedingly stupid person,
and the uncompromising enemy of all workers,
“The central idea of Theosophy,'’ says
Annie Besant, “is one great circle of light spread-
ing from the rare to the dense, from the intangible

objective;” Clear as mud !
The Bulletin hopes that N S.W. Chief
Forester lidnie-Brown is encouraging the local
cultivation of the cork-tree. Lemonade-bottles of
course don't need corks, but when the Prohibition
cranks get into office we shall want quite a lot of
corks for our ginger-beer.
Miss Maud Hordern, eldest daughter of
Mr. Sam Hordern, gave two piano solos at the
concert held in the New Masonic Hall, Castle-
reagh-street, at the social held in connection with
the provident society of the establishment. For
so young an artiste it was a very creditable per-
formance.
Last week 1400 fine old corpses were, it is
cabled, found in the vaults of a London church.
Which reminds us of another case there, where
the Sunday School children, under similar circum-
stances, were plagued with big black flies, called
" Undertakers.” How we worship the dead—-and
damn the living !
Cardinal Moran asserts that the Church
lias always “ taken the slave by the hand. ” That’s
just where the Cardinal is wrong. The Church
has mostly taken the slave by the hair. And,
by-and-bye, the slave will take the Church by the
ear and the collection-plate, by way of returning
the compliment.
A Sydney Sunday paper lately accused
“Jupp” Gardiner, M.L. A., of disturbing the
House with snoring on a certain evening.
Gardiner happened to be in Parkes at the time,
which fact either proves that he lias a very power-
ful bugle, or that the journal in question has
mighty long ears. The ears have it, in our
opinion.
By cable from Maoriland we learn that
Moss, who attempted to murder his wife at
Ashburton amTtbcn tried to commit suicide, has
been found not guilty, on the ground of insanity
when the act was committed. This decision is
almost equivalent to a declaration that wilful
murder does not exist. No murderer can be
wholly in possession of his faculties at the actual
time of commission.
That genial old soul, Obed West, one of
Sydney’s patriarchs, is dead, aged 84, leaving
much money, land, and bricks-and-mortar. The
ancient undoubtedly knew a lot about the remote
past of Sydney, but was in the habit of mixing
his dates terribly, and confounding his personal
experiences with things which lie had only read.
He had never been out of N.S. Wales in all
his life.
South Australian Chief Justice Sammy
Way “who has been invited everywhere to meet
the German Emperor,” will, it is cabled, “spend
some days at High Wycombe in September help-
ing Lord Oarington to put the final touches to the
story of his Australian experiences.” Carington’s
“ experiences ” will be painfully incomplete unless
they contain a full account of the wormy crawl-
someness of some Australian lawyers.
Central Cumberland election should end
in the return of Labour Candidate Marshall.
The Bulletin, however, is rather surprised to
notice from the press reports, that Mr. Marshall
instead of sinking the fiscal question is inclined
to sound the praises of foreign trade and unduly
assault the Protectionist party. This course,
if persisted in, will certainly lead to the breaking
up of the N.S. W. Labour-party. The aggressive-
ness of the Single-tax apostles is a menace to the
solidity of the ranks.
“There is one thing, at least, to be said
about suicide : it puts an end to whatever trouble
one happens to be in—so far as we know ; and we
know all that can be known.” But the misery of
a clumsy attempt at suicide! Last week Mr.
Fred.' Brock, the well-known Sydney stock and
station agent, aged 49, shot himself with a pistol.
The bullet entered the right temple, fracturing
the cheek bone, passing through the right eye,
and coming out of the left eye. The sight of both
eyes has been destroyed. At time of writing the
unfortunate man was lying in the hospital in a
hopeless state. Mrs. Brock is at present absent
on a visit to a relative at Norfolk Island.
Premier Parkes, in his now Electoral Bill,
lias named one of the Sydney Divisions after
Doctor Bland, the friend and colleague of Went-
worth. Sad to relate, a son of the Doctor died a
couple of years ago in one of the public asylums
at Parramatta, lie was a man with a refined and
beautiful face, a clever portrait and animal painter
(horses and dogs were his forte), but a thorough
Bohemian. On the death of his mother at a great
age in England he succeeded to some money, which
from his habits only hastened the end. lie used
to say that his mother lived to such a great age
that she had seen “sets” of trustees under her

Money turned away from three parts of
the house on the first three nights of “Lights o’
London ” has doubtless caused George Rignold to
asseverate : “For this relief much tanks !” “The
Lights ’’ is not, viewed bye and large, a good play
for folks of dismal livers. It is pervaded by a
wrecked father, who has been such a callously-
oriminal scoundrel that it is difficult to ascertain
how he can consistently object to his ruined
daughter doing those tilings which she might
not have done had he shown her a better
example. It is also mottled throughout by
a gentleman arrayed in football costume and
a dirty filce, who drivels and whines about his
two-days’-empty stomach, in a fashion that is
calculated to evoke derision from those who have
seen the forty-days-fasting man. Perhaps, the
least supportable individual of all is the “pheno-
menon ” Shakespeare Jarvis, an irritating person
at any time, but simply insupportable when
trebled by a woman’s puny pipe. Still, there is a
deal of human natur’, some sound sense and heaps
of fun in “ The Lights,” and it is certainly good
fora big run, for as someone yelled from the “gods”
the other evening, when Sterling Whyte dropped
from the bridge into the stream and George
Rignold dived in after him “that’s worth the sugar
itself!” The drama is as -well played, if not
better, than heretofore. Perhaps, George Rig-
nold’s Harold Armytage is somewhat more
doughy than of old, but, nevertheless, the per-
formance is up to sample. Hairy Jewett, on the
other hand, is probably more finished, and in
Jarvis “Bill” Rignold has got somethng easy
and right into his hand. Mrs. Rignold’s Mrs.
Jarvis makes folks wonder why she so seldom
takes to the boards. James Cathcart reappears here
as Squire Armytage, after being absent since he
played Brutus in “ Julius Caesar.” Watt-Phillips’
Bess Marks is marked by the care and complete-
ness of all that lady’s work, but Bessie Rignold is
scarcely adequate to the frivolity expected from
Hetty Preene. The park-loafers of Frank Har-
court and Mabel Tracey, like the fat-faced grub-
stowing boy of Guyton Heath, are remarkably
olever little character sketches. An engine-band
snapped on Monday evening last and left the
house without the electric light for some minutes.

Revived, after a lapse of ten months,
“ A Night Off,” at Sydney Criterion, is likely to
do big business during the projected eleven nights
of its tenure. On Friday, Sept. 4th, this theatre
will be probably closed while the Brough contin-
gent are making for Melbourne, and on the
following night the Boucicaultian wing of this his-
trionic army will put up “ Peril,” recently played
in Melbourne. “Devotion,” Dot’s very own com-
position, probably follows. Marcus Brutus Snap,
played with a vacuous rotundity of voice that is
more Barry Sullivanish than Ansonian, and
looking like a drab pouter-pigeon, with a
red beak and rubescent hackles, is one
of William George Anson’s numerous best
performances, with all the latest embellishments
thrown in. For instance, speaking of Babbit’s
Roman tragedy, he says : “I II produce it if it’s
as bad as “Horny Hands and Bloody Noses.”
The cast has two curious resemblances to dead
heroes. _ George Gordon’s usher is a replica of the
“Hook” of Wellington; and Robert Brough’s
peevish, thin-voiced, watch-spring legged pro-
fessor might pass fairly well about the head for
Abe Lincoln just escaped from Major Dane’s
lecture-list. Miss Romer, Annie Taylor—some-
what too gushy—“ Ted ” Corlessc, Cecil Ward
and Emma Temple repeat former successes, but
Pattie Browne’s Nisbe is a long way from being
good ; and, as Damask, Frank Cates was never
seen to Jess advantage. On first night the show
flagged slightly here and there, but, urged by
cyclonic outbursts of cachinuation, now goes like
hot pies down the throat of a nigger-minstrel.

Elton’s Mayor, who is also an “ old
guard,” is a chameleonic individual; the other
night he reminded us strongly of Toole’s Caleb
Plummer, then later of Maccabe’s “fascinating
fellow ” shorn of his whiskers. His gags over the
broken bayonet of “made in Germany,” and
“ raining in England, doncherknow,” as he turns
up the hems of his tight pants, are received with
such howls of delight nightly, that The Bulletin
inclines to think there would be money in hash-
ing together all the popular sayings, serving them
up with popular airs and dishing them as a plotless
comic opera. There would be absolutely no
strain on the listener’s mind, little on the actor’s,
possibly none on that of the treasurer. By the
way, “ King Billy’s ” exquisite fooling at the end
of the second act kills a rather pretty sextette
stone-dead.

John Roberts, for about 18 years the un-
disputed champion of all-round British billiards
—nrince of the “push,” in fact —concluded a
season, which became highly successful with the
lowering of prices, at the Crystal Palace Hall,
Sydney, on Tuesday. Roberts, the “iron man ”
of billiards, is as square, as hard-looking,
physically and mentally, as on his prior visit, and
is,” perhaps, even more impassible, for any
measure of impetuosity that he may have once
possessed seems to have been eradicated by a
long course of public appearances, and the steely-
grey eyes now light up an organism apparently
as chilly as that of a cold-water eel.
They say Roberts plays better than he did ; the
improvement was not manifest to a merely casual
dropper-in, who missed the dash and daring that
made “young John,” the hero of the British
billiard world, when he and Cook with “Joe”
Bennett, Timbrell and “Master” Stanley were
revolutionising the “ royal game.” But the quick-
sighted , decisive directness, the unerring j udgment,
the cool imperturbability, the old determination
and confidence, the touch, delicate as a lady’s,
allied to the wrist-power of a blacksmith, all
remain, and as the experience is, of course, en-
larged, it is probable that Roberts does play
a better game now than at any prior period
of his career. In Sydney he easily defeated J ames,
Birkett, Parker, and Weston, who received starts
from one-half to six-tenths the game. Roberts’
largest break, 437, was made with Birkett, and
Weston’s 94 secured for that player a silver cup.
The afternoon performances have been invari-
ably attended by many ladies, and the guber-
natorial party has put in several appearances.
Roberts now'plays through the country districts
of N.S. Wales towards Queensland, then visits
Adelaide and Broken Hill prior to touring Maori-
land.

Times have changed. The Age, in a lead-
ing article on the MacMahonian drama, says that
Slugger Sullivan “commends himself even as a
physical curiosity to neither gods nor men, and
only seems a rather stupid caricature of what he
really is.” But which, by the way, is not correct.
Sullivan upon the stage looks exactly what he is—
a retired prize-fighter run to fat.

Although “ II Trovatore ” and “ Martha ”
outstayed their welcome at Melbourne Alexandra,
the shilling pit, which may be accepted as the
barometer of an Italian opera season, has remained
at “ set fair ” thus far, wherefore Madame Simon-
sen may reckon upon getting through with a
credit balance if she makes haste to put novelties,
positive or comparative, before an evidently
appreciative public. “Un Ballo in Maschera”-
that favourite feast of melodies—woke things
right up on Monday, and will keep the ballo
rolling this (Thursday) and following night. The
one young and sylphlike lady of the company,
Signorini Mattioli, blooms for the first time in this
production as Oscar, page to the giddy governor
who ultimately comes to grief through singing
illicit duets with his secretary’s wife. Winsome
Mattioli lends a delicate flavour of leg-show to
an otherwise tragic story of intrigue and political
upheaval. The strength and weakness of the
present Italian invasion have been fairly sampled
by this time. Cuttica is a delightfully sympa-
thetic, yet powerful tenor, whilst Kilalta meets
ordinary requirements as a robusto, but for stage
love-making—the business of all tenors since time
was—the one is too short and chubby, and the
other too small and wooden. Both the baritones,
however, are much more satisfactory in a pictorial
sense, and Melossi has a noble voice entirely. The
fair primi-donni, buxom and matronly-looking,
will always pass muster as actresses in heavy
operas, and compel admiration as vocalists.
Cavalleri, who was formerly cast for all the lead-
ing contralto parts, is now able to take turn and
turn about with an efficient colleague inSignorina
Castiglioni; the basso department is fairly well
looked after, and, with orchestra and chorus in
capital working order, the entertainment, taking
one consideration with another, may be summed
up as the best of the three produced under Simon-
sen management.

“Devotion,” a short three-act Frenchy
drama from the pen of Dion Boucicault, jr., was
elegantly staged at the Bijou on Saturday night,
when His Excellency graciously consented to take
the chair. Described as original, save in the
matter of one leading incident, “Devotion” is a
decidedly artificial story of the Richelieu period,
and the plot is so completely dominated by the
great Cardinal and his royal master that their
absence from the cast is a matter for regret. The
players appear as mere puppets moved to hopeful-
ness or despair, by someone who is pulling a
string behind the scenes. That the ph*y is fa rly
well written and constructed goes without saying,
inasmuch as the author is a Boucicault all over,
and an expert in stage work. But “ Devotion ’is
not a good play, all the same. The hero and
heroine arouse no interest in their troubles,
and don’t appear to be quite certain
whether they are giddy or virtuous. Several
other people, including the heroine’s husband,
ai’e too much mixed up with events that transpire
elsewhere, and there is no air of reality about
things that would, perhaps, appear exciting in
print. For this fatal shortcoming Percy Lyndal
and Mrs. Brough are partially responsible. The
lady occasionally makes a bold attempt to rise to
a false situation, although hampered by a
clumsily-out train; but Lyndal is as unimpressive
as his silk pyjamas, which, by the way, ought to
be frilled and fussed out below the knee.
Titheradge is less happy than usual as a rather
stupid sort of husband, and author Boucicault
strikes one as being the youngest Abbe that ever
went on the loose in holy orders.

J. L. Sullivan drama is considerably
patronised by football barrackers, and other male
members of the unintelligent classes at Melbourne
Opera House, but the rational public seem to have
had enough of a deplorable spectacle on the open-
ing night. Since then the star performer has
turned up in a solemn, sober condition, and
as he sullenly ignores all gallery invitations to
“ put a tail ” on the rest of the company, there is
nothing new to be said concerning that remark-
able man.

“Cinder Ellen” drew a seething first-
night crowd to Melbourne Princess’ on Saturday
last, and seems likely to satisfy the followers of
Gaiety burlesque for the remaining three weeks of
its stay. Whether this brand-new absurdity (said
to be the work of Fred. Leslie) is better or worse
than “Ruy Bias ” is a question that could only be
satisfactorily settled by a jury of Johnnies,
capable of drawing nice distinctions between the
idiotic and the inane. Considering that the same
people play the fool, dance, sing, and continually
change their clothes in either “burlesque,” with
the same old Gaiety regard for a proper distribu-
tion of “fat” in both instances, it is hard for a
tired journalist to see the necessity for ever
altering the names of these variety shows. All
that is done in “Cinder Ellen” might have been
done in “Huy Bias,” or vice versa, without hurt-
ing anybody’s feelings, or making matters more
incoherent than at present. No thread of
humour would be snapped if half of the one
were taken away and sandwiched between two
quarters of the other. The public, who are woe-
fully apt to lose a thread of humour even when
they get it, would probably swallow greedily a
stew composed of odd bits from ten burlesques,
provided that the usual quantity of legs and
topical allusions were thrown into the pot to
represent onions. The performers make what-
ever fun can be discovered in “ Oinder-Ellen.”
Sometimes they are more funny than a dead
rhinoceros. They sink to their lowest depth of
humour in a pantomimic episode which concludes
with a chorus—“ The monn has got his trousers
on.” If Fred. Leslie designed, arranged, and in-
vented this last-mentioned item, he can’t be such
a clever man as one might think. In his stage
character, however, Frederick is bright, mercurial
and amusing as ever. Ditto Cinder-Ellen Farren.
Grace Pedley’s ballad singing and the dances by
Sylvia Grey and Florence Levey are exactly what
was expected, but in point of magnificence the
show falls short of one’s wildest dreams. Less
expensive entertainments have seemed more
gorgeous to the general.

Miss Laura Yilliers and Co. are still con-
fronted by more bare bench than audience at the
old Royal. On Saturday the lady from London
produced “ A Celebrated Case,” without mention-
ing on the playbill that it is just about identical
with Burnand's adaptation of “ITn Cause Celebre”
played in England under the name of “Proof.”
The original run of “ Proof,” one of the strongest
of dramas in capable hands, was remarkable
for the fact that four actors —Charles Kelly,
Bandmann, Harry Neville, and Hermann Vezin
played the hero in rapid succession. The writer
saw three of them in the part within about three
months. Others of a splendid company were
Louise Moody, Arthur Stirling, Mrs. Bandmann,
Charles Harcourt, Bella Pateman, and Mrs.
Billington. With such people in the mind’s eye,
it is impossible to say very nice things about the
very mediocre Yilliers company, but they do their
best, and the drama is quite strong enough to
enable them to make a success.

Two years ago Snazelle opened his one-
man show at Melbourne Athenaeum before a
handful of payers and the rest deadheads. On
Saturday, when that mariner bold re-opened the
same proceedings, the public came rolling up the
hill, like Bonyparty at the battle of Waterloo, to
hear an established favourite give an entertain-
ment which is now understood to be first-rate in
several different ways. The music-halls are all
right, and the Eureka Stockade picture has just
been fixed up at the Cycldrama.

A well-known pug. is just now a perfect
terror to the waiters at one of the chief Melbourne
hotels. There it is by no means uncommon to find
a waiter with his head screwed round the wrong
way, a bruised arm, and a broken spirit, as the
result of his temerity in venturing into the
slugger’s private room with a supply of spirituous
liquors.

Fanny Enson, whose Countess Zicka in
“ Diplomacy,” and Louise in “Frou Frou” will
be remembered while memory hold its sway,
leaves for England shortly. She takes a farewell
benefit at Sydney Criterion on Wed., Sept. 9,
when a mighty multitude will wdthout doubt
assemble to bid a universal favourite farewell.
At Poverty Point.
According to a Sydney paper Sara Bernhardt was
“caressed by many friends” on gaining the stateroom
which the Mariposa’s captain had relinquished in her
favour. For “ many friends” read “certain critics” and
you hit the gusher on a soft spot.
Pattie Browne's knee-cap wasn’t really fractured ; only

Highflyer Higgins was dashed to death in England,
aeronaut Annie Harkess fell hard from a great height at
Oincinnatti (U.S.) and succumbed to the hardness of the
ground, parachutist Pieroni dived from a great altitude
into the Adriatic and became food for fishes, and balloonist
Buckingham found no footing on the waters of Lake
Syracuse (U.S.); further, the foolhardy Fernandez, of
Australia, having avoided death by drowning, was nearly
grilled to death while entangled|by the ropes of his burn-
ing balloon in a Queensland tree-top. Curiously enough,
contemporaneously with these disasters to air-navigators,
comes news of improvements to Maxim’s flying machine—
a steam-kite actually—which, propelled through the air
by a light screw, can, it is cabled, carry a weight of two
tons at a speed of 90 miles an hour.
musical “ classicists ” of Sydney are nearly insane
at the tremendous success of Organist Wiegand’s popular

Henry and Ellen are playing together in “Ravenswood.”
All the same, she will not accompany him to America
whenever he goes on pleasure bent. She prefers her

“ The Nautch Girl,” writes our London correspondent
“ thanks to the old stagers like Denny, is gradually work-
ing up into a good opera. The bookings are enormous,
almost up to the highest standard of the old Carte-Sulli-
van-Gilbert regime.
Haddon Chambers says that the play he is now writing
for Tom Tlmrne will set the seal on his fame. His fees
for “The Idler ” amount to £75 per week.
Christie Murray is back in London, looking well. He is
determined to test the judgment of the London critics on
his dramatic work, and has nothing but what is good to
say of the “ Colonics.” No sooner had he set foot in
England than he was met with matrimonial troubles. He
is not quite sure whether or not he will venture on the
boards—at least for a while.
M. Maurel, the French baritone, recently distinguished
himself at the Actors’ Benevolent Fund dinner, in London,
He accepted a treble encore for his song and gave £lOO to
the Fund in return.
A London County Councillor has dropped £250 damages
and costs for slandering a marionette performance at
Westminster Aquarium. He declared that he saw through
his spectacles, one marionette behave indecently towards
another marionette, whereas both figures were proved to
be as pure and chaste as a Baptist congregation, or more
so. The old gentleman, it appears, wears blue spectacles
and naturally discovers a cerulean meaning in every-
thing.

The American soprano who took up Nellie Stewart
rejected part in “The Nautch Girl” turned out a dire

Madame Simonsen advertises “ Martha ” in preference
to “ Marta.” It is, in truth, absurd to Italianise the name
of the heroine of an opera which includes such sternly
English characters as Nancy and Plunket. You can’t
make them into Italians, nohow or anyway. If memory
tells truly, “Martha” was Italianised in the interests of
Giugluini, the tenor of 30 years ago.
Arthur Dacre and his talented wife (Amy Roselle) have
been having a terribly bad time in America. B. &B.
ought to pick (hem up cheap for a season in Australia
where the lady, at any rate, would speedily take the
shine out of one of her “star” imitators. Dacre, too, is a
nice-looking actor of superior Frank Cates quality, and
the pair might do almost as well as the Kendals, who
seem to have left no room for them in Yankeeland.
Beerbohm Tree intends to make his Hamlet dehut
before a Scotch or Irish audience.
Irving is adopting all sorts of strange devices to keep
business brisk at the Lyceum. He gives morning per-

Charles Westmacott, one of our most promising actors,
a white man in every way and a thoroughly good and
genial fellow, sailed from Sydney for London in the
Murrumbidgee on Saturday morning. He may return
soon; meantime, he will be best remembered for his
auctioneer in “The Octoroon,” Tybalt in “ Romeo and
Juliet,” and his old dodderer in “The Middleman” —
three quite dissimilar characters.
Fred. Neebe takes a Sydney benefit soon.
Marie Frazer, a lady w’ho, if memory does not fall, recently
made a London hit in one of Ibsen’s plays, has arrived
in the Oruba under engagement to B. and B. She opens
in “Sunlight and Shadow,” one of several new' plays
secured by Alex Mayne for the firm. By the w*ay, he has
also engaged Miss James, a smart soubrette, with an
Adelphi reputation, and has secured tor B. and B. the
first Australian refusal of every play Pinero, Grundy and
Jerome write for the English stage.
Mr. R. B. Wiseman, a well-known man in theatrical

The Dampiers appear to have had another good time in
the Sandhurst and Ballarat districts, where “ Miner's

introduce it as new*.
Brian Dailey was recently met in one of the London
clubs, very much the West End swell. His voice had been
restored to him by a surgical operation, and altogether
Brian was the Brian of old, when Sydney ladies raved
over him and the morning post brought him many
delicately-scented notes.
Catherine Sinclair, widow of Edwin Forrest, died a few’
weeks ago in America, aged 76. She acted in Sydney and
Melbourne 36 years ago with Henry Sedley in “ Much Ado
About Nothing” and other pieces. She was a very
beautiful woman. Forrest, who married her in England,
falsely accused her, and she got a divorce with £3OO
allowance a year, but Forrest never paid it. She died
poor as an actress.

It was originally intended that Emperor
William should visit the London Naval Exhibi-
tion on a Sunday. But when a large, tallow-faced
M.P. fixed Mr. Speaker with his fishy eye, and
asked him whether he thought the Board would
like one of the Anointed to break the laws of
Moses, the diplomatic William telegraphed over
from Germany that he would “ do ” the show on a
week day. So the Sunday was set apart for a
select royal orgie, and Christianity went on as
usual.
Says a Bulletin London correspondent:—
It is a subject of remark that the German Emperor
speaks English with much less of a foreign accent
than his uncle, Albert Edward. In point of fact,
the Kaiser’s English is almost perfect. A great deal of
rubbish has been written in the Telegraph and other
papers respecting the Emperor’s personal appearance.
“ Every inch a king,” say they. In reality he is a ven
ordinary-looking person, with nothing commanding at all
about him. He is short, walks badly, despite his long
military training, and has a pale, almost sallow com-
plexion. His forehead is high and intellectual, and his
smile is winning. He has a certain hauteur of manner,
too, which is, in its way, effective, especially w hen he is
compelled to listen to dreary and frequently ill-worded
addresses. On the whole, he was very well received in
England, though it can hardly he said that his presence
evoked the same enthusiasm as did his fathers. One of
the features of the procession to the Guildhall was the
cheering when the Prince of Wales’ carriage passed.
Much of this, however, was undoubtedly for the Princess,
but Albert Edward took it all to himself apparently, if
one may judge by the gracious manner in which he
bowed to the crowd.
Mr. Thomas Taylor, Foreign-trade candi-
date for Central Cumberland (N.S.W.), objects to
Mr. Garrard’s candidature for the same place,
because “ it is a shame to import a gentleman to
crush out local ability.” This may be good logic,
but it is woefully bad Ereetrade. The only use of
Ereetrade is to import cheap foreign articles to
crush out local ability, and the one essential is
that they must be cheap. Garrard is cheap, and
the only thing Taylor can do to excuse his
existence is to be cheaper than Garrard. As
Taylor is a cheap man by nature he may succeed,
but even then he shouldn’t complain of Garrard,
for the essence of both their creeds is free com-
petition, and if six men after one seat isn’t free
competition, then what is?
They have a kind and thoughtful constable
at Outram (M.L.). He was prosecuting a local
landlord for Sunday-trading, and had brought in
two witnesses to testify, when he discovered, to
his alarm, that they were both very drunk. It
was a tight place, but in the bright lexicon of the
“ cop.” there was no such word as fail. Seizing
the drunker of the two, he rushed him out into the
yard, and poured twelve buckets of water over
him to bring him to. Then he rushed him back
again just as his name was called, and the testifier
lurched into the box with water pouring out of his
hair and his ears, and half-a-bucket in each
pocket, and a lot more in his hat, and stood there
coughing and blowing his nose violently. Then,
in a fatal burst of confidence, he addressed the
bench as “ old rooster,” and the case fell through.
The wet drunk was committed for contempt, and
his companion, the dry drunk, was left on the
pavement, and the proceedings terminated.
“ Universalist ” thus addresses us :
Dear Bulletin,—l noticed in your last issue a para-
graph wherein you set out that O’Sullivan, M.P.,
opposes divorce on behalf of the section whose religion
denies them the moral, social and political right of
divorce (?) I beg to inform you that the R.C. Church is
not a civil or political institution. Catholics care very
little what Divorce Bills are passed; such legislation in
noway affects us. In the R.C. Church matrimony is a
sacrament, and quite as obligatory as the other sacra-
ments of that Church. It is not merely a. contract
entered into between two persons who seek the
pleasures of conjugal love. Marriage has a very dignified
definition in the R.C. Church. In the R.C. religion
there is no doctrine favouring divorce, and if such were
inserted, “to keep up with the times, you know,” the
religion would cease to be the same as it has been since
its inception, 1900 years ago, to the present day. The
R.C. Church exists in all “political climes,” and has
never altered its doctrines to suit anybody. Catholics
hold that a sacrament is altogether outside politics.
Here comes the “ rub.” You are always preaching
against religious interference in politics; why, then, do
you favour political interference in religion ? We have a
religion and are satisfied with it, so you need not go into
hvst»ria over our “ misfortune." Let those who want
the “moral,” “social” and political right join some
other fold. Under the banner of the Roman Catholic
Church, women are, at least, free from the designs of
depraved men.

POLITICAL POINTS
There are but six Labour representatives
in the Commons.
The Victorian Legislative Council appears
to be entirely under the political control of three
firms of solicitors.
-A Tasmanian M.L.C.-the other day rose
to a point of order. His point was that the
speaker was leaving out all his aitehes.
Bir George Grey’s law reform measure,
which opens the profession to women, has passed
the Maoriland House of Representatives.
Parkes says he is not responsible for any
“itch in the N.S.W. Electoral Bill.” Neverthe-
less, he will be compelled to scratch much of it
out.
The violence of the Age attacks upon
Commissioner Speight is making people look for
some virtue in the Victorian Railways management
after all.
Has Boss Templar Clarke, M.L.A., in
accordance with the “Labour edict,” one-man-
one-billet, resigned the paste-pot and scissors of
the Temperance Would ?
Schnadhorst, the father of the “ Caucus,”
and former lackey to Joe Chamberlain, has apolo-
gised for having presented the brother of that
right honourable renegade to a radical consti-
tuency.
Parkes’ admiration for Crick is marked.
He beams with delight whenever that smart young
man takes the floor. As a matter of fact, Crick
says all the nasty things that nothing but Parkes’
position keeps him from saying.
Toby Barton should know better than to
say a Governor’s speech is “a speecli from the
throne.” But he was a member of the National
Australian Convention which wanted to compel
the Australias to Federate “under the Crown.”
The supersensitiveness of a few Labour-
members in the N.S.W. Assembly to political
badinage is becoming rather ridiculous. The
philosophy of the thing, however, seems to be that
no man is so easily offended as lie who is in deadly
earnest.
Mr. Chanter, ALL. A. (N S.W.), has a
sneaking liking for the plural-vote system, as he
holds that people who have property in N.S.W.,
but who, for commercial reasons, do not live in
the province, should bo allowed to exercise the
franchise.
The true cause of the weakening of
Parnell's influence in Ireland arises from the fact
that, for the time, his work is done. Irish dis-
satisfaction was built up on tenant troubles and
the Land Purchase Bill has momentarily quieted
agrarian agitation.
Ex-Premier Murehead (Q,), who hastened
out from England to save his beloved fatherland
from the wicked shearers, has duly come to hand.
He thinks Australian Federation can only be
brought about by “ outside pressure, such as a
war. ’ \\ ith whom- —and for what?
The American Consul in Melbourne says
that the legal machinery of Victoria (and N.S.W.)
is clumsy and absurdly expensive as compared
with that of the United States. He might, too,
h.i'e instanced Canada, where one can drop into a
lawyer's office and get quite a Jot of work done in
less than no time for a modest four or live dollars.
It is as good as settled that Duncan Gillies
will take over the Vie. Agent-Generalship from
(i raham Berry early next year. Duncan has made
his pile, Ids political light burns lower with each
fresh railway “ revelation,” and it’s about time
that lie went “Home” and became “Sir”
1 hmcan.
Brass is the thing in polities. Speaking at
the rather 'poorly-attended lecture last week°by
Air, Cox, ALP., on “Notable Irish Eviction
.'■cones,'' Postmaster-General O’Connor, according
to the daily press, stigmatised as “mean and
cowardly” those who refused to attend the lecture.
What a tail our cat has got since the Redmond
t me!
Air. Dan. O’Connor has not settled down
to the chill atmosphere of N.S.W. Legislative
Council. He usually occupies a louelv seat on
the back Ministerial bench, and treats with com-
parative indifference the cold glances of the old
political relies whom he used to denounce with
the fervour of his race from a safe distance in the
Assembly.
'1 be Anglo-Australian Bank, Melbourne,
grounds through locking up money in two big
accounts. The old story; every new bank is
started to meet the felt want of the struggling
trader, but drops into the swim, with the "cock
salmon of the big accounts, wherefore another
new bank is needed. A es, the State Bank, by
the people for the people.
The method of manufacturing votes on
[•oiling day in West Sydney is thus described by
Jawbone Neild ; -“ A building is hired, and it is
fitted up with a large number of spare coats, wigs,
and false whiskers, and people get Is. apiece for
going to the polling place, and voting in the names
of other people. Some men get3os. a day by com-
mitting this offence against the laws of God and
man.”
Mr. llingnose Wise has very smugly
delivered himself of this ex-cathedra opinion in
the N.S.W. Assembly
lam delighted to see a clause in the Bill which requires
that it a man cannot write he shall not have a vote. I
no not want illiterate foreigners coming to this country
and swamping our educated Australians.
Pretty cool from a barrister whose university
polish was presumably paid for with the proceeds
ot a State pension.
It has just been pointed out that secular
education is omitted from the N.S.W. Labour
Electoral League platform. The Bulletin pre-
sumes that this is due to the fact that the educa-
tion question is regarded as settled, so far as its
,®i® 18 concerned. One thing, however, is certain
Parkes’” education system is (unlike the
Victorian system) as yet neither free nor secular,
though it is supposed to be compulsory. To be
justly compulsory the system must bo made both
tree and secular.
A North Shore (Sydney) paper, complain-
ing of the dilatoriness of the ghost at the recent
elections, incidentally mentions that Messrs.
Gul en and Bums paid their own and Sir Henry
x arkes advertising expenses. It is extremely
gratifying to know that the local “ Archimedean
lever ’ has got his money, but if he wanted to
THE FIRST THING THAT STRUCK HIM.
JONES : “This is a pleasant surprise. And what are you doing now, old man?”
BROWN (languidly): “Oh, I’ve been in the Government service for the last four years,
doncherknow.”
JONES: “Four years! When are the usual defalcations coming to light?”
electrify the world lie .should have stated that the
thornier stood Sain for the three. “Hi never
I'aid s«, £T, for expenses at any election,” says the
G.O.M. It is much more prudent to let common,
vulgar people look after such sordid humdrum
work.
New South Wales is notorious for the
number of its Royal Commissions. This political
disease is approaching alarming proportions.
The slightest opportunity is seized by Parke,s for
shunting his responsibility on to a commission,
composed chiefly of Parkesiau political dead-
beats. The Public Service Inquiry Board is the
laughing-stock of the Public Service : a quintette
of boys in knicker-bockers could not ask sillier
questions than they do; and for this frivolous
service handsome fees are paid. Hawthorne and
Abigail are now billeted on the country to
officially discover what everyone knows—the
gambling, immoral and insanitary habits of the
Chinese.
The delay of Parkes in appointing a Public
Works Committee is viewed with strong disfavour
by some members whose perquisites from this
source used to amount to several hundreds a year
in the last Parliament. The delay is excused on
the ground that £5,000,000 worth of public works
which have been approved of have yet to be
sanctioned by Parliament. But with the reten-
tion of this patronage in his hands the old man
feels he is in a better position to weather the
political storm. Were he sure of his present sup-
porters he would soon find a reason for bestowing
some fat billets among the members, and commis-
sioning them to report upon the expediency of
errecting, say a bridge to North Shore, a bridge to
Balmain, or a bridge to Glebe Point. Masterly
inactivity is surely Parkes’ card while the Elec-
toral Reform Bill is being knocked into shape.
The N.S. W. Assembly, on an off-night
last week, affirmed its opinion that all marble
required for public works should be obtained from
quarries owned and worked by the State. The
vote was virtually a censure of Bruce Smith’s
action in vetoing the use of colonial marble in the
new N.S.W. Lands Office. The principle, or
rather the extension of the principle, of State
Socialism was a live feature in the debate. The
emphatic vote of the House struck this minister
all of a heap; and while the members were
rubbing their hands with joy, and resuming their
seats, he smartly moved the adjournment of the
House—to avoid a second defeat on the question
that all rolling-stock required for the railways
should be manufactured in the country. To have
negatived his motion, as a minister, would have
meant the ministerial exit of Parkes with his
Some-men-one vote Bill.
I ho L ope s Itncyclical on Labour, so far as
it is practical
At this moment the condition of the working pouula-
tion is the question of (he hour. It has come to piss that
n“ 1U " ! ave been " n en ovel '. isolated and defence-
css, to the callousness of employers and the srreed of un-
lestuuned competition. Rich men and masters should
lemember this—that to exercise pressure for the sake of
Sam upon the indigent and (he destitute, and to make
one s profit out of the need of another, is condemned by
al laws, human and divine. The experience of his own
weakness urges men to call in help from without (work-
men s associations). We road in the pages of Holy Writ

inn TI le b L ; ss have a claim to special considera-
n°L.r r ,i 1IUIC ?' P°P«latioii have many wavs of
protecting themselves. It may be truly said tb it it is
only by the labour of the working man that Stales grow
neb. 'Mien workpeople have recourse to astrike. it is
requently because the hours of labour are too long or
the work too hard, or because they consider the wanes
insufficient. The laws sliould be beforehand, and prevent
hose (roubles from arising. It is neither justice nor
humanity so to grind men down with excessive labour as
to stupefy their minds and wear out their bodies. Those
vviio labour in mines and quarries, and in work within the
newels of the earth, should have shorter hours in propor-
tion, as their labour is more severe and trying to health,
in regard to children, great care should be taken not to
place them in workshops or factories till their bodies and
minds are sufficiently mature. For just as rough weather
ties, troys the buds of spring, so too early an experience of
nre s hard work blights the young promise of a child’s
powers, and makes any real education impossible. Women
aie not suited to certain trades, for a woman is, by
nature, fitted for home work. If working people can lie
encouraged to look forward to obtaining a share in the
land the result will be that the gulf between vast wealth
and deep poverty will be bridged over.
Those members of N.S.W. Parliament
who, like the newly-elected Dr. Cullen, think it
good policy to resent the “insult to the press”
implied in the recent motion to establish in
.Sydney a daily Hansard, must be either grossly
ignorant or grossly hypocritical. The press
emphatically does not report, and never has
reported on their merits, the utterances of poli-
ticians. Anyone privileged to thoroughly know
the secrets of the prison-house is aware that in
every daily newspaper-office—the exceptions are
too few to vary the rule—a certain code of
instructions is from time to time issued by the
editor or the fat proprietor for the guidance of Par-
liamentary reporters. Where is the scribe who
lias not in the course of his experience
seen the F.P. enter the reporter’s room with
Aever let the name of So-and-So appear in
m y paper to the extent of more than two lines
unless it is in connection with a criminal charge
preferred against him and then bump it out or
something like that ? Yet the proscribed M.P.
in such eases, often is one of the cleverest men and
best worth listening to in the whole country- but
lie has committed the unpardonable crime of act-
ing independently and sticking his knife into the
tat proprietor’s private interests. For years there
were standing instructions in Melbourne daily
newspaper offices to boycott David Gannsonjust
as there were for many years standing instruc-
tions, executed to the letter, in Sydney offices, to
boycott and stifle Melville and Luscombe, and
every other lone-hand N.S.W. member who did
not join in the chorus of the song which it pleased
a conspiracy to sing. “Cut ’em off with a line ”
was the word in the Parliamentary gallerv. So
little dependence is to be placed on newspaper
reports that in the absence of the official short-
hand-writers you could in after years pin no poli-
tician to anything under Heaven. Premier Parkes
says he “ would vote for the abolition of the
official reporters of the house to-morrow.” Very
likely. The official reporter is the man who acts
as memory to the Parliamentary turner and
twister. He is the man who holds the wriggling
eel by the back of its neck with a firm grip.

To the smart reader who looks at the bottom of
all advertisements to see if Warner’s Safe Remedies
are the raison d'etre of the articles, this note is
specially addressed. Such are the curative
properties of the “ safe cures ” of H. II. Warner
* Co,, that the onetime almost universal con-
servative objection to proprietory medicines has
been entirely broken down and the “ safe ” cures
are becoming the household medicine. You may
not have any disease now, but you do not know
when it may evidence itself. If you are ill, never
pass Warner s safe cures without a trial.
Remember the power of the remedies was proved
m the first instance by Mr. Warner himself and
were famous thro’ the length and breadth of the
Ameilean continent before they were introduced
into Ragland, Europe, Asia, .or Australia.
Remember that testimonials from creditable
c.ti/.ens of all nations have been received, grate-
fully acknowledging the unparalleled excellence
oi the cures, and that in this connection the firm
make a standing offer of a reward of £1000 on
proof of'the unreliability of any certificate. If
try one of the Cures rightly named
Otife. and you will profit thereby. Remember,
you must do the sum to prove it, and all. the
neglect iu the world to use the remedies, will not
prove that the remedies themselves arc not as
represented. Read this before you buy. Remember,
we don’t cure everything with one bottle. Take

Mr. John Cape, who died at Launceston
recently at the age of 83, was a son of Mr. William
Cape, who was master of the Sydney Public
School in Castlereagh-strect in the early twenties.
In Lis young days he supplied the weather-records
to the Monitor! His brother, Mr. William T.
Cape, kept the well-known school in King-street
in which so many of the leading men of N.S.W.
were educated.
A lady tells The Bulletin that she
remembers going to private school with Madame
Melba in years gone* by. Melba had a decided
penchant for eating pork pies late at night, and
whistling in her sleep. (So we should think).
She also whistled during the day when the girls
marched two and two through the streets of East
Melbourne, and was many a time rebuked and
punished for said crime.
An old man well-known as “Tom’’and
proprietor of a barrow and boot box, who stood

Sydney, went to Maitland some time ago for
work. He lodged in a miserable hovel in the

in his bed. On examination he had secreted
about him no less than £5OOO, which, as he had
neither kith nor kin, went to swell Treasurer
M'Millan’s “surplus.”

trine was evidently one that enforces equity upon
the world, and he reprimanded those people who
by quibbling perverted justice altogether.” Here-
upon the Hebraic Salomons (cheerfully): “I am
afraid the lion, member has access to papers and
books which I am not able to see.”
The Age London correspondent writes on
Adam Lindsay Gordon, as his most intimate
friend. Corrects Patchett Martin’s poetic, pic-
turesque account of how Gordon died. Patchett
writes like an eye-witness of how Gordon got up
at dawn, kissed his wife, took his gun and went
forth, with many other details—the whole thing
being imaginary, because he shot himself in the
evening, after being at the Yorick in the after-
noon. Gordon lost his money keeping a Ballarat
livery-stable.
On May 1, 1891, five persons said to be
over 100 years of age were inmates of the N.S.W.
Government Asylums. Two at Liverpool, one at
George-street, Parramatta, and two at Newmg-
ton. In the asylums on the same date were 48
persons between the ages of 90 and 100 years, four
only being females.
Sir Alfred Stephen, Lieut. -Governor and
ex-Chief Justice of N.S.W., who entered his
ninetieth year on 20th inst., arrived in Van-
demonia in 1824 (G 7 years ago !), and helped, as
Crown Solicitor, Solicitor-General, and Attorney-
General respectively of that hell-upon-earth, to
administer a bloody code in one of the most
bloody times of history. Yet, here is the old man
with all the traditions of the past weighing upon
his brain influencing and directing the criminal
legislation of N.S.W. in the year of grace, 1891.
The state of Spurgeon’s health as per

help saying that if he really has granular disease
of the kidneys, as stated, he might as well die at
once. It will save him ever so-much trouble. The
Almighty never cures granular disease of the
kidneys on any account, and the poor parson s
friends might as well pray for a slice of the moon.
Seven years ago, Patchett Martin’s article
rn Adam Lindsay Gordon introduced him, in
Temple Bar, to the English reading public. This
led to much Gordon material being showered on
Martin, who unloads in the latest Murray’s
Magazine. Gordon’s father sent him from home,
under 20, as a scapegrace, for illegally taking the
horse of one Black Tom, to ride in a steeplechase.
The poet’s wife was a poor girl, daughter of a Robe
(S.A.) working-man, and employed at a bush inn.
After Gordon’s death she married a Mr. Low,
who, so far as we can hear, is not a poet. Gordon
and she lost a daughter, aged two years, and there
were apparently.no other children.
They are going to have a close season for
kangaroo in S.A., while in the mother colony
they cannot be shot down fast enough.
Some of the old identities of Launceston
(Tas.) have just died off. In the last fortnight
there departed four persons over GO years of age,
nine over 70, eight over £O, and one over 00 !
The amalgamation of the Exchange Bank
of Australia, Ltd., with the Sydney Deposit Bank,
King-street, is a step in the right direction and as
following in the lino of the English banks, a great
number of whom are adopting this satisfactory
method of concentrating their energies and
capital. The total business of the Exchange
Bank has been merged into that of the Sydney
Deposit Bank, and under the able management of
Mr. T. S. Richardson, the General Manager, con-
tinued success is assured. The latest development
in banking has been promulgated by the Sydney
Deposit Bank who have for some time past given
practical effect to the principle of equitably
dividing banker’s profits with depositors’. The
Exchange Department is very interesting, and
travellers to all parts of the world are informed
that they can obtain or dispose of coins and notes
of all nations, also circular notes of exchange are
issued negotiable in all the principal cities through-
oK the world.*'
Within a radius of six miles from the

The “genial” Willie Jinkins (everybody
in the theatrical business-manager line is genial
on principle) is just now calling the attention of
the nobility, gentry and public press —especially
p.p.—to a patent incandescent gas light, diffused
from tubes of platinum, or something, around the
vestibule of Melbourne Opera House. • The
advantages claimed for this new patent illuminat-
ing power are calculated to make any ordinary
gas consumer kill the rate collecting man next
time he comes round for the money. It is said to
cost no more than a simple nimble “bob” per
1000 feet, and, seeing that its steady mild beam
goes almost as far as the electric-light the patent
gas bids fair to enjoy a bright future, always
provided that the promoters are correct in their
calculations. The main ingredient being air,
there is no solid reason for questioning the present
estimate, because atmosphere is remarkably
plentiful and can always be laid on at a low price.
Prejudice is as varied in its operation as
ts victims are countless. Like sunshine and
rain, it falls upon the evil and the good ; but,
unlike the gifts of God, it is only fruitful of
mischievous • wrong. Many a sad and lonely
soul is wearing out to-day a life become pitiable
by prejudice. Many a bright hope and noble
aspiration has been blasted by its withering
influence. In the world around us there are
those who longed to do—aye, and would have
done—yeoman’s service for God and truth and
right had not the black shadow of prejudice
blocked their progress. Surely we may call it
a cruel and cowardly vice. Not only so, it is a
foolish one as well. Like justice—though in a
far different sense—prejudice is blind ; for,
while very potent to oppress and injure the
good, it just as often perhaps places the un-
worthy upon a pedestal of honour. Led by
the passing gossip of triflers, even well-inten-
tioned men, too lazy or too careless to examine
for themselves, surrender to its influence what-
ever fairmindedness they have, and thus private
reputations, social reforms, national affairs, and
even religious observances become the victims
of what is neither more nor less than criminal
thoughtlessness. Don’t be prejudiced against
Clements Tonic because it is a patent medicine,
or because some unscrupulous chemists and
doctors depreciate it. They only speak against
it because it pays them better to mix some of
their own concoctions ; and in this case you
have to take your chance of getting what may
suit your case, for it all depends whether they
may have the required drug in stock at the
time. Nqw r , this is not the case with Clements
Tonic, for every article required in the manu-
facture of this remedy is specially imported,
and used for no other purpose ; consequently
it is reliable and genuine. Clements Tonic does
not claim to cure everything ; but in many
special forms of disease it has been proved to
possess wonderful curative properties. There-
fore, is it not better for sufferers to use this
remedy, which has been proved reliable in
thousands of cases, than that they should be
experimented on by physicians and pseudo-
chemist-practitioners. You know you get a
genuine article in Clements Tonic, while it is
very doubtful if even the man who mixes your
medicine hap-hazard knows for certain what
he’s putting in the bottle Exceptions always
prove the rule, and an eminent physician writes
under date November 12, ’9O : “ Dear sir,—lt
gives me much pleasure to send you an acknow-
ledgment of the therapeutical value of Clements
Tonic. It behoves a medical man to be
extremely careful in lauding the value of any
patent medicine, the great majority being
entirely worthless. I have had, however,
practical demonstration in two cases of extreme
debility which have been under my personal
supervision, and which, I am happy to tell you,
made a wonderful rapid recovery by the use of
Clements Tonic. One very valuable end you
have achieved is that Clements Tonic can be
tolerated by an irritable stomach, which is so
often concomitant with atonic dyspepsia, and
which frequently debars the physician from
prescribing many valuable remedies, most of
which you have, however, combined in Clements
Tonic. In conclusion, permit me to congratu-
late you on the success you have obtained, and
which you thoroughly deserve. —I am, etc.,

Raymond Terrace, N.S.W. Mrs. E. Pike,
certificated midwife, Enmore (N.S.W.), writes ;
“ I have great pleasure in adding my testimony
to the efficacy of Clements Tonic. I suffered
from general debility and low fever, which had
afflicted me for two years, and Clements Tonic
set me up completely. lam never without it
in the house, and I find a few doses a capital
pick-me-up after fatigue, and I always recom-
mend it to my patients when it is needed.—

The fascinating divorced wife of a well-
known Sydney business man has “ chucked ” her
00-respondent, and now basks in the smiles of a
swell in the Guards. She is, writes a correspon-
dent, to be seen every Sunday very smartly dressed
at the Guards’ Club, Skindies, at Taplow, in com-
pany with her new Johnnie. When last seen poor

Item for a certain Melbourne man’s eye 1
A marriage has been arranged between Hon.
Frederick Rossmore Wauchope deMoleyns, of the
4th Hussars, A.D.C. to Lord Hopetoun (brother
of Lady Hopetoun) and Miss Millicent Wilson,
eldest daughter of Mr. Charles Wilson, of
Warter Priory, Pocklington, and M.P. for Hull.
Mr. Wilson is a member of the celebrated ship-
ping firm of Wilson Bros., of Hull, and brother
of the owner of Baccarat Hall, otherwise Tranby
Croft. The brothers Wilson are immensely
wealthy, and it is said that they consider it a
very bad year when they do not divide £400,000
between them. So Master de Moleyns, whose exit
from Melbourne took place under such auspicious
circumstances, has fallen right on his feet.
# # #
Our old friend, Benjamin Trovato, Esq.,
is now telling this story. The other day a
certain Australian dignitary—or shall we say
personage ?—whose wife somehow or other is not
received at local Government House, was talking
with His Ex., and the conversation drifted to the
subject of women drinking too much wine on
social occasions, particularly at Government
House. The personage deplored the custom,
“ and,” said he, “to mark my disapproval of it,
I do not allow Lady X. to visit Government
House.”
# # *
J. F. Patterson, the Melbourne artist,
thinks precious little of Sarah Bernhardt. At
that dismal Athenseum reception he craftily fixed
up a chair of honour right bang in front of one of his
masterpieces, and when Sara had gone away with-
out gushing over this noble work the little man
decided, once and for a’, that she no appreciated
airt, ye ken.

Apropos of something or other, impecuni-
ous Judges have sometimes found effective
methods of getting “even” with obdurate
creditors. A Victorian solicitor held the note of
a certain minor Judge for £5O. When due, a
renewal was refused and payment insisted upon.
The Judge waited his opportunity for revenge. 11
came. The creditor was sadly given to tippling,
and, when in his “cups,” was not overguarded in
his language. He had occasion to appear before
the minor Judge, for whom, by the way, he had
a most supreme contempt, and in the course of his
case made use of language which offended his
Honor’s ears. An apology was promptly de-
manded and as promptly refused, whereupon his
Honor sent the attorney “up ” for a fortnight,
and all the efforts of the friends of the latter
could not induce the Judge to relax the severity
of the sentence.
# # #
That story of the vagrant ex-policeman, in
Melbourne, reminds us of another member of the
force, a fine specimen of manhood in his prime,
a sergeant, who on all State occasions
attended the Governor and generally wore a
stand-off-the-grass air. He left the force
and took a public-house, the Scots Greys, in the
very worst part of Little Bourke-street. If he
thought the “push” would support him for his
own sake he was more or less mistaken. If they
did drink in his house they gave him —especially
the women—all sorts of trouble. The sergeant went
from bad to worse, was sold off, and died, poor
devil, in the most abject poverty and misery on
the bare floor of the Little Bourke-street drink-
shop !

A certain English peer, who not so very
Jong ago visited Australia, lost £87,000 in mining
deals with one Sydney broker alone. Among his
transactions were the purchase of 4000 Webbs, at
£4 10s. (they are now Is. or so); 3000 West
Wallsends, at 275. (now they’re Os.). He bought
Souths, at £l4 10s. (now they are £5). The mar-
vellous rise in Broken Hill Proprietary lured
him on.
# #
When will the scandal attaching to a cer-
tain Australian Judge, whoso house iiTconstantly
invaded by bailiffs, be done away with? How
can a man do justice between litigants, one of
whom holds his dishonored promissory- notes?
# * #
The late Victorian Chief Justice, Sir
William Stawell, was a very mild man and seldom
gave way to surprise. He was, however, very
nearly knocked off his official perch in Chambers
one morning, when a well-known solicitor and his
clerk appeared before him to get his signature to
an order for a ca. re. (please note the difference
between Stawell’s act and that of the Judge in
Sydney who signed the order for ca. re. in the case
of the Actor-Managers, Gerald and Huff.) The
attorney had included 10 guineas in the document
as “ his costs ” when Stawell observed that he was
a Judge of the Supreme Court and not a taxing-
officer, and promptly ran his pen through the
amount. This was a little more than the attorney
bargained for, and forgetting the awful presence
in which hestood, said notto vocc, “B (hie) fool.”
Stawell stopped writing, and looking up said, in
his quiet way: “Hid I hear anyone speak?”
“Yes, your Honor,” promptly responded B——,
the clerk, “Mr. H——applied the remark to me
for my stupidity in inserting the costs.” Stawell
paused and presently said, “I accept the explana-
tion, but don’t let your principal appear before me
again in a state similar to that in which he now is,
or I may send him into retirement for a time.”

A Sydney law-clerk recently tried, day
after day, to serve a writ on a local builder, but
in vain. The defendant could not be found. At
last, encouraged by the promise of a new hat from
his employer, the scribe made another try, and
was successful, but it nearly cost him his life.
The builder was on top of a three-storey building
in course of erection, and the clerk, pretending
SHE KNEW IT.
PARSON : “It is not the body that needs most looking after, my dear young lady.”
SHE : “I know it isn’t—it’s the skirt.”
that he was the architect’s employe, climbed up
the shaky ladder. “ Are you Mr. B. ?” be queried.
“Yes,” said Mr. 8., with a smile. The pen-
wielder thereupon handed him the writ, displaying
at the same time the original. As he did so, he
saw a mischievous scowl darken B.’s face. He
understood it immediately and waited not a
moment. Down the ladder he went like a
monkey, with the defaulting builder close upon
him, threatening, in awful language, to “bust his
head in with a brick,” Once upon the ground the
clerk ran like a deer, Blank following him
with a big half-brick, and cursing like a
backblocker. It was a long run, but the clerk
got away alive, and won his hat. It was a tvvo-
and-sixpenny one, with a bashed crown, and thus
Capital got ahead of Labour once more, and the
toiler was again left.
# # *
Mr. W. H. Burgess, the chairman of the
unfortunate Y.D.L. Bank, is a big sufferer by the
failure of that old institution. He has not only
resigned his seat for West Hobart (with the re-
version of the Tasmanian Premiership in his
hands), but has even struck himself off the Com-
mission of the Peace. He has thrown up every
public position he held, discharged his servants,
removed his children from school, and put his
house in order for the grim finale. Mr. Burgess
has many sympathisers in the tight little isle.

Said Sara Bernhardt to Myra Kemble ;
“Some people seem to be complaining of the im-
morality of the plays I present here. I can only
tell you, my dear, .that no actress would dare to
wear, in a respectable Paris theatre, the dresses
that some of the ladies wore in ‘Evangeline’”—
or words to that effect.

ON THE BAY.
(For The Bulletin.)
Up with the jib, and slip the moorings.
Let her pay off till the canvass fills, so ;
Now she is feeling it, haul in that sheet there.
More, now belay ; and then, off we go.
Out on the water flashing with sunlight,
Out on the glistening rollers of green,
Down in the hollows, with wave-peaks around us,
Nothing but cloud-dappled blue to be seen ;
Up to the sky again, on to the crests of them,
Giddily reeling ; then the down-plunge again.
Everything drawing, ropes taut as muscle-cords,
Humming wind-music, so tight is the strain.
Eyes on the sail-hem, carefully feeling
Nearer and nearer the wind’s-eye she creeps,
While over the bows of her, into the skin of us,
Bubbling and soaking, the showering foam leaps.
All is the fun of it, all is the joy of it,
Oh ! for the rush through the salt driven spray.
The rolling ! the wetwind ! thesplashing ! the tossing !
There is no joy in life like a sail on the bay.

The partition of Sydney politically suggests
that Premier Parkes is perpetrating a jest at the
expense of the “ upper ten.” For voting purposes
lie has joined Woolloomooloo and Potts Point in
political wedlock, and caps his little joke by
calling the division after one of New South Wales’
most immoral Governors, whom he himself.once
denounced in this sturdy fashion: —“ It is
expedient that the Queen’s moral character —and
she is highly moral and virtuous by all report—
should not be represented by immorality
(Fitzroy). We believe it is the bounden duty of
all colonists who disapprove of the personal
characters of any officers of rank to abstain
from giving them countenance under pretext of
loyalty.”
* # #
Parkes was in a saturnine mood when he
selected the names for the new electoral divisions
of Sydney. Of the 11 divisions, only two beat
the names of pioneer politicians. “Slippery
Charley ” is perpetuated in the “Cooper” Divi-
sion ; and another division is named after good,
brave old Dr. Bland. Lang, Deniehy, Dailey,
Martin, Forster, Smith Hall, Lowe, Campbell,
are all forgotten, while narrow-minded Governors
like Gipps are honoured. The only excuse for
honouring Gipps’memory must be the similarity
of his disposition to Parkes’. For of Gipps it has
been written: —“Rude . , in his manners,
arbitrary in his disposition, and overbearing
in his demeanour. His moral sense also was
somewhat obtuse; and he was remarkably defi-
cient in the finer feelings and relentings of
humanity. His inferiors regarded him rather
with fear than with respect and reverence; and
while he succeeded in making many enemies, he
made no friends.” For the late Chief Justice
(then Mr. James) Martin’s opinion on Governor
Gipps. vide Barton’s “ Poets and Prose Writers of
N.S. Wales.”

The most beautiful and graceful ornaments
yet attached to any building, public or private,
in Australia are undoubtedly the half-draped
female figures which support the electric lamps
outside the Australia Hotel, Sydney, They form
indeed a lesson in art and an eloquent apology for
the absence of barmaids from the great hotel. A
curious legend attaches to these two beauties. It
is said that the management engaged in Europe
two Hebes of surpassing loveliness. Just ere they
were to depart for Sydney, “Ginger” 0 , a
well-known Australian gentleman, called at their
residence to say good-bye. On seeing “Ginger ”
the maidens at once turned into brass. Where-
upon they were packed in cases and sent along to
Manager Moore, who fixed ’em up outside his big
pub.

The fact that 20 men are now in Darling-
hurst prison for wife-desertion, and only two for
wife-and-child desertion, affords an interesting
glimpse of the main cause of marital unhappiness.
The Bulletin wonders what view is taken of this
aspect of the matrimonial question by the Woman
Suffrage Society ? From an independent woman
standpoint, how can it be reasonably argued that
any man should be put in gaol for deserting his
wife if they have no children ?

Another parcel of amateur white mis-
sionaries (chiefly women, of .course) are about to
leave the sin-stained city of Sydney with all its
miserable poverty-stricken wives and children for
China, in the charge of a clergyman. Six more
missionary women follow in September, under the
charge of another parson. How affectingly
beautiful! And it’s all in the interests of that
bumptious, organised hypocrisy, the London
Missionary Society, advance-agents for the same
pious J. Bull who not so long since forced opium
on China at the point of the bayonet.

Maria Island (Tas.) graveyard—weird,
wild, silent and sad —faces the great ocean looking
towards Maoriland. Here may be seen six old
blackened grave-stones, bearing the names of six
Maori chiefs, transported there for trying to drive
out the invaders of their fatherland in 1846. An
old inhabitant of the island says that the saddest
sight that ever met mortal eyes was to see these
brawny, dignified men sitting on the high, rocky
cliffs where now they sleep—longingly and sullenly
gazing towards their lost homeland.

A curse seems to have hung over the old
“Bank of Van Diemen’s Land,” which lately
went smash at Hobart. No wonder, with such a

Several of the officers of the now d>

It has been specially remarked of late
that, thanks to the forethought of a former
Governor, two of the private spare-bedrooms at
Government House, Hobart, are immediately
contiguous to a private staircase leading into the
street. Gentlemen can, therefore, qome in—and
go out—when they like.

One of the successful bowlers for Harrow
in the recent annual cricket match, writes our
English correspondent, was young Rome, son of
“Tom ” Rome, formerly of Northampton Downs,
Queensland. He is the youngest lad who has
ever taken part in the schools match, being only
a little over 15 years of age. 'He is six feet high,
and when he has thickened out a bit will develope
into a bowler of the first class. He justified his
selection by taking five wickets for a good average.
His father was until last year the popular master
of the Cotswold Hunt (“ I remember the lowering
wintry morn and the mist on the Cotswold hills,”
sang A. L. Gordon), and a better man across
country cannot be found, Pat Osborne used to
hunt with this pack, but it can hardly be said that
he kept up the reputation of Australia for horse-
manship, though he rode the very best cattle.

The Trinity Hall (Cambridge) crew which
won the Visitors’ Cup at Henley the other day,
was composed of three thorough-bred Australians,
Garrick (son of Sir James), Ned Lord, and Lan-
dale, whilst the fourth man, Fog-Elliott, who
stroked the crew, is the son of a lady who was
born in Australia. The cooees which greeted their
victory might have been heard a mile off. Aus-
tralia was well represented afloat and ashore.
Mrs. Bassett (a sister of W. C. Wentworth) has a
house just at the winning-post. The Letts—
Charles A. W. L. is still beautiful as ever—have
a cottage close by ; Sir James Garrick shared a
house-boat with Agent - General Samuel, and
Mount Morganaire Knox D’Arcy had a “swag-
ger ” one all to himself. The Fred. Want’s were
on board the Albany Club house-boat, and dis-
pensed hospitality freely. There were hosts of
other “colonials” present. The difference between
a colonial and an Australian will be explained
when we have more time.

Melbourne papers carefully refrained from
reporting a spicy little case in which a certain
newspaper man figured as defendant. A young
female, describing herself as an ex-virgin, charged
Jimmy with being the author of her shame, but
the allegation broke down in all directions, the
aged father’s curse was dismissed as a put-up job,
the tears of the fond mother for her “ruined”
child fell upon stony ground, and James left the
court with a character still unspotted before the
world. So completely, in fact, was his innocence
established that James’ successful endeavours to
keep the matter out of print can only be attributed
to his abnormal modesty. Few evenin’ newspaper
men would, under similar circumstances, have
shown such self-denial. Why, in the name of all
that’s good and pure, didn’t the Howl burst
forth with a speshul edishun, containing a true
and particular account of this interesting episode,
headed “Virtue Again Triumphant!” and illus-
trated with portraits of the Snow-White Male and
the Black Fe-Mailer ?

The divorce-case of Crawley v. Crawley,
just finished in Dunedin (M.L.), is a solemn
subject and full of pathos. The parties were
married in 1886, and the bride wept all through
the ceremony. She didn’t want to be married,
but having promised in a moment of aberration,
she was too young and too much frightened to
back out. When the ceremony was over she was
still weeping. She howled bitterly on the door-
step outside the church, and attracted a crowd.
Her husband got excited, and hustled her away
to the nearest quiet spot, which happened to be
the cemetery. It was a damp, sodden, winter
day, and the trees were bare and shrivelled, and
the earth was slushy, and there was ice on the
tombstones, and the inscriptions were frozen hard.
It was one o’clock when the happy pair reached
this place, and the bride wailed among the sepul-
chres until six. Then Crawley threw up his con-
tract and left. His new-made wife was flabby
with weeping, and as limp as a strip of blotting-
paper, and her lugubrious howls in the solemn,
windy twilight, among the homes of the dead
inhabitants, were too much for Crawley. He laid
clown his hand. He quitted, in short. He left
bis bride, and his situation, and his house and
furniture and everything else, and vanished.
Nobody saw him or heard of him again. And
now the law has granted a divorce on the ground
of desertion, which is an unkind way of putting
it, seeing that the real causes were damp and
incipient rheumatism.

A certain mental specialist, of Melbourne,
said, on first seeing murderer Colston : “ If he had
come into my study casually, I would have at
once signed his certificate of insanity.” Yet he
declined to give evidence at the trial, and the
defence had no funds to make his evidence suffi-
ciently spontaneous to call him !

Young Lord Hope rode on one of the
young St. Bernard dogs during the late Mel-
bourne show. Ten minutes after the dog’s ticket
was marked “Sold—price £40.” It was worth
about a tenner—outside price. Happy is the man
who has a lord to ride his pups.
# * #
The Victorian authorities decline a post-
mortem of Colston. They declined it in murderer
Johnston’s case, as he objected. Colston wishes
it, and they still decline. This is not the action
of a civilised Government.

With much reluctance we print the
following :
Dear Bulletin, — Despite all that has been said to the
contrary I firmly believe that every woman, whether
happily married or otherwise, has secret hankerings after
divorce. Women are so sentimental, so romantic, that
even after bearing dozens of children, losing hair and
teeth, and running into 20 stone or so of too solid flesh,
they imagine that some handsome bold-eyed boy is likely
to fall in love with them could they only obtain a suffi-
ciently bewitching costume. Of course, they wouldn’t
do anything wrong, oh, dear no ; therefore they would
like to be able to obtain dissolution of the marriage con-
tract on the grounds of incompatibility of temper or
snoring in slumber, or some otherwise grave cause of
domestic disagreement. Meantime, they consult “the
cards,” and console themselves with fortune-tellers. —
Yours, A Much-Married Man.

A melancholy death occurred at the Alfred
Hospital, Melbourne, not long ago. The doctor
forbade fruit to a typhoid patient, but the latter’s
friends brought in grapes, and joked him into
eating one or two, when bowel-perforation and
death ensued.

There was one mysterious female in the
famous baccarat party at Tranby-Croft who,
apparently, will never be cleared up. None of
the witnesses ' mentioned her name—she was
merely alluded to as “a player.” None of the
lawyers demanded her name in cross-examination,
though why they didn’t no one can explain. She
was officially smothered and put out of sight, and
whether she was too shady to be mentioned, or
too important to be exposed, or too particular a
friend of the Prince of Wales to be spoken of, can
only be conjectured. One theory is that she was a
princess out on the “bust” at midnight in an
atmosphere of liquor and long, black cigars ; the
other theory is that she was an actress with a
damaged reputation. Anybody who could clear
up this point would probably be made a colonial
Governor to keen him quiet.

In the gazetting of Lieut. E. R. Connor,

attended by much jealousy. The appointment is,
financially speaking, no “ catch.”

nearly all the nags served their time in cabs or

was horsed, and which would never gee-up until
the driver made a noise like a door-bang.

A Melbourne paper suggests the substitu-
tion of ginger-wine, lemonade, and other tem-
perance drinks, for champagne at balls, etc. In
view of what has occurred on several occasions
lately at Sydney “ chivoos,” in consequence of
the plenitude of “fizz,” a re-action in favour of
“soft” drinks, for ladies especially, has ret in
amongst hostesses (headed by Lady Jersey)
of the City of the Beautiful Harbour. Can
it be the aptitude of very high - toned
young ladies down South to indulge in
step-dancing in the streets after the formal close
of social festivities, which prompts a change in
the style of refreshments?

The new swell dance, performed to the
air of “the Bogie Man,” is the Angels’ and Demons’

their hair, flowing wing sleeves, and a big spray
of lilies in their hands. The devils are got-up
with long black forked tails, while tufts of hair
on either side of the head give the idea of pointed
ears. Black coats, with a kind of bat’s wing
under the arm and joined to the side, black bands
of silk across the shirt front, to cover all gleams
of white knee breeches, silk stockings and

erudition equals, if it does not excel, his elo-

classicism, in which many complimentary
references were made to sundry personages known
to antiquity as Demosthenes, Plato, &c. A

criticising his rival’s “ oraition,” alluded to it as
too “ ilimentary,” and censured his compatriot foi

doughy and unwholesome) was being whirled
away from the tabernacle in a closed carriage the
Archbishop of Canterbury took part in a general
waving of handkerchiefs. The Queen is said to
have smiled graciously at his holy enthusiasm, and
the Almighty also made a note of it, no doubt.

Randolph Churchill was so consummately

that his fellow-passengers burnt him in effigy when

least guilty of some redeeming conduct cn route.
“He needlessly outraged the feelings of the
Sabbatarians on Sundays,” it appears.

The Bulletin begs to acknowledge, with
a prolonged shriek, the receipt of the Richmond
and Twickenham Times Supplement, dated J une
13th, 1891. This damp sheet (for it is wet with
cur bitter tears) was issued in celebration of the
silver wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Teck,
and contains beautiful portraits of that revered
couple and family, both individual and collective ;
also, portraits of the couple before they had a
family, and sundry reproductions of old pictures
illustrating incidents of their marriage day. Many
columns of printed matter, commencing—“ Now
that aU England is rejoicing with the Duke and
Duchess of Teck in the celebration of their silver
wedding,” assist to make the aforesaid supple-
ment an historical souvenir and a joy for ever.
Wherever the English language is spoken this
illustrated narrative deserves to find purchasers.
It is essentially touching. The fact that a bank-
rupt German Serenity should hang on to the same
old wife for a quarter of a century must send a
thrill of satisfaction through every taxpayer who
c ontributes his mite towards the support of their
c ome stic bliss. Australia, as well as the beloved
mother country, glories in the blessed thought
that Teck was happily restored to the arms of the
Queen’s cousin after he had had a row with her
over an actress some fifteen years ago. But for
Tummy’s thoughtful behaviour in bringing Teck
back to the Royal Family circle on that occasion
we should have had no national rejoicings, no
provincial newspaper supplement, no reminder
that a fat, unintellectual pair of sold-up loafers
continued to exist to point a democratic moral and
adorn a darned penny-royal tale.

A LETTER.
Melbourne, August 22, 1891.
Dear Heditor, —I’m in a scot, O I’m sweatin’ an
dasliin’ my gaiters,
For a man down at Brunswick has got nearly
rooined for sellin’ pertators
On Sunday, a week or two back, to some little
hinnercent sinner,
Whose mother was cookin’ a snack, and wanted
two pen’orth for dinner.
The h’infant goes todderlin’round with a bag (as
the riter supposes)
And the shopkeeper weighs out two pound, for-
gettin’ the Bible an’ Moses,
But Nemmersis comes in the guys of a h active
intellergent ‘-copper,” „ , ,
He twigs the transackshun an sighs, My Bora ’
this is ’ighly improper.”
So he took out a summuns, he did, and carried it
round to the dealer
Who’d traded off spuds to that kid, without givm’
a thought to the “ peeler,”
And, cuttin’ a long story short, this here was the
magerstates’ sentence —
A fiver paid down into Court, or a month in the
cells for repentance.
Tee kulprit looked calm and resigned, he ’adn’t
the ’art for resistance,
He borrered the “ quids ” he was fined, an’ faded
away in the distance ;
And, as for the worshipful beaks, I’m told (by a
pal as reported)
They blew out their worshipful cheeks an’ looked
up to ’Eaven and shorted.
I've stated the facks o’ the case, and now you can
underconstumble
Why I cuss till I’m black in the face—it’s enuff
to make any man grumble ;
If this country we live in is free, as they tells us
in speeches and sermuns,
Why, I wish I was over the sea, along with the
French and the Germuns.
It’s O ! to be down-trodden slaves in lands where
there’s no Missis Grundy,
Where a cove can get liquors, an’ shaves, an’
“smokes,” an’ pervishuns on Sunday,
And order a smokin’ ’ot roll, or buy his young
woman a present;
' Out here they look after your soul in a way wot is
’orrid unpleasant.
Dear Heditor, I shall “ levant ” (that’s furrin for
“ slope ”) from a region
Of tyranny, ’umbug, an’ cant, an’ bye laws for
spreadin’ religion ;
Such laws may be ’onestly meant, but they ain’t,
I don’t think, the Creator’s,
For He wouldn’t fine any gent, for a-sel!in’ two
pounds o’ pertators.
So if I don’t write any more you'll know by this
’ere little token
That I’m orf to a wickeder shore where the dear
“ mother tung ” isn’t spoken :
An’ if I ’ang on where I am you had best keep a
h’eye on my verses,
Tor I’m bound to be droppin’ in “dam,” an’
ventin’ mv h’anarer in curses.

Herr Rassmussen, the celebrated Danish herba-
list, is undoubtedly one of the most hardworking
and deserving among Australian scientists. His
Danish herbal remedies are too well and favour-
ably known to the public to require any addi-
tional praise. His herbal discoveries which
are numerous, have already given many hands
employment from tune to time, one of which is to
extract a purer eucalyptus oil from our gum-trees
than any which has hitherto been produced This
improvement is brought about with his newly-
invented eucalyptus extractors and condense/s.
lo manufacture this improved eucalyptus oil
Herr Rassmussen is about to open large
eucalyptus works at his estate at Minto, where
experiments are now being carried on very
successfully. _ Tasmanian blue gum trees
have been imported and planted there for
the last five years, and they are thriving
splendidly ISo doubt this extensive under-
' Vl bo , ns s '! ccessfnl as a 'l his previous
undertakings have been, and his new product
will find its way throughout the world, as his
celebrated Denmark herbal remedies have done
Herr Rassmussen has just opened a very large
establishment at 047 George-street, Sydney, for the
sale of his well-known Denmark herbal remedies
and it us not only the most scientifically-complete
establishment of its kind in Sydney, but it
is also the most pretty and artistic to be seen in
Australia. Large crowds of eager onlookers are
seen inspecting the interesting windows contain-
ing his wonderful microscope, his numerous
Government registrations for his remedies, and
his hundreds of testimonials, as well as the mag-
nificent gold medal awarded to him. Sufficient
proof will be seen m his windows of the entire
genuineness and reliability of his remedies, which
are now patronised by the whole world. The
magnificent fittings of this establishment were
carried out faithfully and well by Mr. Peter
homle cf this city. Herr Rassmussen may well
be proud, of his new establishment.

“ Pendragon,” of the Referee, who visited us
i few years ago, and is now dead, cut Up rich (saj s our
correspondent), the personalty amounting to nearly
£5O 000; realty not stated, though it must amount to a
considerable sum. He leaves his wife a life interest in his
estate, with remainder to his adopted daughter, who has
■lower of appointment. In the event of her death, with-
out having exercised such power, the estate is to be
divided into three parts, of which G. 11. Sims and Dick
Butler, who has been for years “Pen.’s” righthand man
and friend, take one-third each, and the remaining third
coes to two or three charities connected with the printing
t nde Considering that the Referee has been in exist-
ence only about 15 or 18 years, and that for a great por-
tion of that time Sampson had only a comparatively small
interest in the paper, some idea may be formed of what a
p-rand property it is. Already one misses the master-
hand. In the natural order of things men write them-
selves out, and even Sims’ liver begins to cease to have
anv interest for people who buy a paper for the sake of
the news it contains. Martin Cobbett still contributes
the “ Sporting Notions,” and the “ Handbook” continues
to be a leading feature of the front page. Probably
Sims will not write for the paper much longer. With
all his love of money, he begins to find the work
irksome. Besides, he is “beastly rich,” and can afford
to forfeit his stipend from the Referee. Martin Cobbett,
besides writing for several papers, including the Mel-
bourne Age, is a turf-commissioner, and makes a large
income as such. He does business for some big men and
is generally in the know. Occasionally he is put in the
cart and you can always tell when this is the case by his
assumption of high tone and purity when he writes in the
“ Darebin ” Guesdon is back in Hobart again,
where he has many friends and one or two deadly foes.

Larry T'oley is no end of a speculator, and if
anyone goes to him with a “ good thing,” Laurence, as a
rule, has the pluck to grip it. However, a gentleman
recently returned from the Islands came to Larry, the
other day, and unfolded a scheme for annexing real
estate that even the ex-champion had not the pluck to
tackle. During his trip to the Islands the traveller had
come across an island, “ a regular little daisy of a place,”
to quote his own words, “ with only about 40 inhabitants,
ruled by a decrepid old chief.” The plan of annexation,
as unfolded to Larry in all seriousness, was that the two
of them should start from the neighbouring islands in a
cutter laden with a cask of poisoned rum, and that such
of the inhabitants who escaped the rum should he done
to death with the shooting irons, when the island could be
jumped. Larry admitted the millions that were in it, but
he nevertheless passed.
* * *
At Sydney Sailing Club’s meeting the other
day “there was a discussion as to the regulations recently
gazetted by N.S.W. Marine Board for the regulation of
hired sailing boats, those present expressing considerable
indignation at the class legislation shown. It is a well-
known fact that hired sailing boats are the best built and
best found boats of their class in the harbour, and when
these boats are out of date, they generally find their way
into the ranks of private boat owners. Why these boats
should be selected by the Marine Board to legislate on,
and private boats with defective sails and gear be allowed
to do what they like, is at present a mystery.” It is no
mystery. “ Hired” boats are often let to a crowd of in-
competents, who carry a lot of helpless women as pas-
sengers-each man or boy having his girl with him.
Private boats are usually sailed by experts (men who own
boats soon learn to sail them), and as they, as a rule,
carry fewer persons than hired boats, there is less danger.

Dan Cooper told cricketer Barrett that he con-
sidered the quality of the English racehorse, all round, to
be far superior to that of the Australian article, although
a wonder like Carbine would doubtless hold his own in
the best of company.” And even Carbine is as English as
they can make ’em in New Zealand, a fact which The
Bulletin is not too nationalistic to remember.

The sporting world relapsed into a cynical
smile when Mr. Willie Jones recently announced that
Dreadnought had partially broken-down. Check-suited
philosophers called to mind how Bravo nearly broke
down a week before winning the Melbourne Cup, and
some of them rushed off to back Dreadnought on the
strength of his infirmities. Now that the Australian Cup
hero.of 1889 has indeed “gone for ever” the word of
Jones is held sacred in tobacconist’s shops, and the
double-event layers sing praises to his name.

A certain wealthy sporting man gave, for many
years, ten guineas to buy a trophy at a certain annual
metropolitan dog-show. ' This year his name does not
appear. The story goes that a man, last year, walked
into the sporting man’s office, and, hanging down a plated
mug, asked him what he meant by giving that as a ten-
guinea tronhy. Mr. B. was thunder-stricken, and ex-
plained that he gave his cheque for ten guineas. The
mug was second-hand—value, say, 15s. Someone “got
the run,” and Mr. B. and others who heard the story
withdrew from the show.

The first stag-hunt ever attempted in Maoriland
came off the other day near Wellington, with much eclat.
The local Hunt Club fetched along the stag, and turned
it out in front of a great assemblage of dogs, idiots, and
money-lenders. The animal, of course, should have
bolted, and then all the dogs and Hebrews would have
galloped and howled like blazes in the rear; but instead
it started to eat grass by the roadside. Somebody
walloped it with a whip, and it ran into a paddock and ate
some more grass. Then the local small boys and cads and
larrikins tried to scare it away with screams and brickbats
and bottles, and at last it was induced to go off at a
canter. The dogs cantered also, and the uncles and
clerks and tailors swore and thrashed and gal-
loped and perspired in the rear. Next, the tame
stag hid itself among some cows, but being
yelled at and dog-bitten it went off again, and
after cutting itself on' various wire-fences it was overtaken
by the dogs and bitten some more. Then the show ended,
but the wretched animal died that night from fright and
misery, and being chawed at by mongrels, and yelled into
a premature grave by pawnbrokers. The one redeeming
feature about the show is that Governor Onslow wrote to
the club, and gave it most particular sheol, and Tub
Bulletin - trusts this fact will be remembered in his favour
and writ large on his tombstone. For it is better to give
a lift to a harassed brute that is being welted with fence-
rails by the upper ten in the name of sport than it is to be
a K.C M.G. and sing the “ National Anthepi ” till one
bursts.
J. 0. Fergusson, S.M., formerly deputy-
collector of Customs, and latterly clerk of Adelaide Police
Court, who died last week, was in his time one of the best
rifle-shots in Australia. He had been in Government
employ for 42 years, had been twice retrenched, and at
his death was receiving the munificent salary of £280 per
annum.

A yell of execration arises at the Adelaide
police authorises’ action with regard to the bookmaking
fraternity. No betting is now allowed outside the grand-
stand, with the result that the wagering is almost
entirely restricted to the half-guinea division ; the public
—who are the main supporters of the bookmakers by cash
betting—being almost wholly debarred from putting their
money on. The result is that the races are poorly
attended, and excitement-greatly on the wane. They
always did make a hash of racing in S. Australia.

K EEP IT FOR REFERENCE
The following suggestions are not designed to
induce the public to attempt the duties of the
regular surgeon, but merely to place the reader in
possession of a means of treatment of the minor
accidents occurring daily in the household. No
family can be assured against accidents; the
broken bone, the dislocated joint, the severed
artery—these are misfortunes that may possibly
happen to anyone; and we scarcely need to add
that they demand thp instant attention of the
most skilful surgeon within roach. But by house-
hold accidents we mean those which are constantly
occurring every day, in nearly every family, and
which, while not always dangerous in themselves,
are exceedingly annoying. Burns, bruises, cuts,
scalds, sprains, &c., are principal among these
troublesome and annoying occurrences, and
demand immediate treatment with the best means
at hand. In the kitchen, the dining-hall, th e
nursery, and the sitting-room they are liable to
happen, and instead of fear and alarm at the sight
of the cut or smashed finger, or burned or bruised
arm, or scalded surface, a cool and quiet manner
should be assumed, and after washing away the
blood (if required), the injured parts should be
dressed with that most valuable remedy—St.
Jacobs Oil. Its especial worth for the injuries
named, and others of similar nature, is not based
upon mere claim and assertion ; but its constant
use for a long term of years has given it a reputa-
tion which is always increasing. Its surprisingly
quick relief, its cleansing properties, its tendency
to quickly remove all inflammation, and its
wonderful efficacy in the above, as well as in all
muscular and other pains, such as rheumatism,
neuralgia, toothache, headache, stiffness of the
limbs, joints, &c., these qualities render St.
Jacobs Oil pre-eminently the best external remedy
before the people, which claim is fully sub-
stantiated by the class of strong testimony
voluntarily accorded it by representatives of every
class and station in life.
THE PANGS OF CONSCIENCE.
There is no necessity to commit wilful murder,
or to speak in a loud and angry tone of vo ce to
one’s mother-in-law, to understand how Richard
111. felt on the bloody field of Bosworth, when
admitting that
“ My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And every tale condemns me for a villain.”
Any man, whether he be a king or a contractor
for the supply of shoddy stores to a trusting
Government, must feel pretty bad before he can
talk like that, although Richard was only talking
to himself after a bad night passed in company
with an undigested supper and a queer I t of
ghosts begotten thereof. And it is really astonish-
ing what a number of people do accuse themselves
in this drivelling fashion. Some do it out loud,
but unconsciously. Take themselves into their
own confidence as it were, while walking along
the streets in pursuit of their ordinary avocations,
or while sitting at the table at the mercy of the
smart waitress, who has been away for ten or
fifteen minutes in chase of another cup of tea or
some other painfully common-place hash-house
commodity. It is at such times as these that the
pangs of conscience are apt to break loose in the
system, and run a wild riot among the heart's
best feelings ; for no matter how much the best
man may struggle to hide himself from his friends,
there are moments when self-control becomes as
impossible to the conscience-stricken man as to
the one whose epigastrium has gone back on him
in a heavy head sea on board a small coasting
steamer. Conscience makes cowards of some, and
only fools of others. It makes the worst kind of
coward of the man who is mean and reckless
enough to curtail his household expenses to the
extent of lighting up his home and family with
bad kerosene, ami who in consequence thereof
arrives at the garden ga.te some night just in time
to see all his household belongings careering
madly skywards through a rent in the roof as a
first result of the cat having knocked the lamp
down. His conscience will never let him forget
that, and serve him right too ! He can avoid it
if he will by burning only Luxcne, the new
illuminant, which is beautiful to the eye, pleasant
to the nostrils, economical to the pocket, and safe
in every direction. Corroborative testimony on

The great Maoriland sea-serpent has “a

head. A missing politician.
According to the late Peter Lalor, the
nationalities of the killed and wounded at the
Eureka Stockade were as follows : Irishmen, killed
10, wounded 10; Englishmen, killed 1, wounded 2 ;
Scotchmen, killed 1, wounded 0; Prussians,
killed 2, wounded 0; N. S. Wales, killed 1,
wounded 0; Canadians, killed 2, wounded 0.
Iwo men were killed whose nationalities were un-
known and three killed whose names and country
were unknown.
Significant proposition tabled in N.Z.
Parliament:—
That, in order to give an impetus to and permanently
an^'cll^ure > all N.Z. products (and people?)
should he carried free upon the railways of the colony,
and that a commercial marine-service be organised to
connect with the railways; also that the revenue
required to provide interest and maintenance, short of
that derived from other sources in this service, be made
up from a special land-tax.
Ihe argument is that there is no more reason for
charging the people for the use of their own
railways than there is for charging them for the
use of the public roads. Moreover, a system of
free conveyance by rail would tend to promote
settlement in the country, and check the present
fatal tendency toward concentration of the popu-
lation in large towns and cities.
In one of the colonies of which he was
Governor in his youth, Sir George Grey and a party
came to a river which was difficult to ford, and at a
spot where it never had been forded. Right there
the Governor wanted to ford it, and, as he always
had his own way, his companions left him, went
to the regular crossing place further up, and
reached a shanty on the other side. An houi
or two passed and the Governor didn’t tun
up. Evidently something had happened tc
him. The party went out to look for his
corpse, and had been away some little time
when a horseman, who had manifestly been
having a bad wet time in deep water, rode
up to the shanty and, as he dismounted, casually
asked the proprietor whether there was any news.
“Oh> yes, sir; there’s great news!” said the
man. “ ihey think the Governor’s drowned in
the river. We shall get a bridge now.” “And
that’s what you call good news, is it?” said his
visitor, good-humoredly. “ Well, I don’t think it
is. lam the Governor.”
Dear Bulletin,—You have ere now noted the
fjreat anxiety of Chief Justice Darley to purify the atmo-
sphere of the N.S.W. Supreme Court and its neighbour-
hood- Inside the court rooms his Honor lias been very-
thorough in his renovation. The old, time-worn seats to
which clung memories of the Martins, Butlers, Daileys
Broadhursts, and a host of other brilliant barristers, have
given place to highly-varnished, newly-smelling “pews,”
on which are labelled the respective classes of persons
permitted to occupy them. They are, however, seldom
occupied now. The legal learning of Martin, the wit of
Dailey, the rugged eloquence of Butler, and the rounded
periods of Darvall are wanting to attract audiences at the
Supreme Court, even if the C.J. had left room for the
decent portion of the public. A stranger, however respec-
table, on entering the court-room, is pounced upon by
one of the sheriff's myrmidons (in many cases foully reeking
of tobacco and stale beer), a id if the visitor be not a limb of
the law, a J.P. ora pressman, he is incontinently told
there is no room, though nearly all the seats are empty •
hut he may find a porch up in the c ck-loft, dignified by
the name of gallery. There is, however, one more reform
which the Chief Justice might undertake with advantage
to people having business at court, and with persons who
have to use King-street on business or pleasure. Every
day, whether the courts be sitting or not, the verandah
of the court-building exhibits a crowd of unwashed un-
kempt men whose eyes “ purge thick amber and plum-
tree gum.” They even invade the path in front ot
the building, and not infrequently- find their ways
to the opposite side of the street, blocking up the road
and generally inconveniencing the public. On inquiry we
are told that these gentry are bailiffs of the Supreme
Court, or rather the “ men ” that the S.C. bailiffs put in
“possession,” when some unfortunate gets within the
clutches of the civil law. In Melbourne, I understand',
the Sheriff provides a room where these necessary if
otherwise harmless, individuals can seat themselves till
wan ted. They are not allowed to hang about the doors
of Melbourne’s palace of justice, and I think that Chief-
Justice Darley or the Sheriff might, with profit, intro-
duce both the room and the rule in the Sydney Supreme
Court.—Yours, Btsn Lawyer.

Pentecost satirises the dogmatists
Bok is. Bok created man a living slork. After man
dies he will pass into the land of harmulkins and dwell
with the juflams forever. Can anybody understand
that? Certainly not; became nobody knows what cer-
tain of the words mean. Until those words can be
defined, the sentences in which they appear cannot mean
anything. I made up some sentences like the foregoing
a few days ago, and asked a man if he understood what
they meant. He said he did. I asked him to explain
them to me. He said he could not do that, but that if 1
would open my harraulkinal eyes I would understand
them. I asked him what my harraulkinal eyes were, and
he told me that could only be harmulkinally discerned.
And I could see that he was very earnest in what he was
saying, and that he thought he knew what he was talking
about—hut I didn’t.
Secured Deposits. —ln view of the promised
legislation to regulate the business of those finan-
cial institutions which receive money on deposit
from the public, we are pleased to notice that a
step in the right direction has been taken by the
Universal Land and Deposit Bank, Limited, who,
in a little pamphlet entitled “Mutual Banldng,”
have called attention to a few points of practical
interest to all bank depositors. The main idea of
the above company appears to be that the
depositors, not the shareholders, should be the
first to receive the benefit of the profits made by
the bank, whilst, by the issue of debentures, they
(the depositors) obtain a first lien over all the
assets of the concern and are in possession of a
collateral security equal to the sum deposited,
which, by the way, bears interest. The scheme
is entirely novel, and we think the originators
deserve the support of the public in their efforts
to improve the position of the depositor. We
commend the above-mentioned pamphlet to the
attention of our readers who contemplate invest-
ing their money in this manner. It is forwarded
post free to any address by the bank, whose office
is at 301 Pitt-street, Sydney.*

NOBODY WANTS THAT GOLD RING.
For nearly 100 years a certain family of working
people living in Paris have ended their lives by
suicide. From father to sou, from mother to
daughter, has descended a plain gold ring, and on
the finger of every one of these suicides, as they
lay in death, this ring has been found. Only last
year the body of a young man who had killed
himself was brought to the Morgue, and on his
finger was the fatal golden circlet. H e was the
last of his race. The ring was buried with the
corpse, from which no one acquainted with its
history will have the courage to remove it.
The mental taint in this family came from some
remote ancestor, and was intensified by their
recognition of it until it became a controlling
force : and the ring was accepted as imposing upon
its possessor the obligation to commit suicide,
after the example of the person who last wore it.
This form of mania usually originates in a disorder
of the nervous system, which in its turn arises
from anaemia, or poverty of the blood, one of the
results of imperfect nutrition.
A recent letter from a gentleman living in Nor-
folk contains the following assertion : “/ longed
for death ; I was afraid of the night; I was afraid
to he alone, yet I hated society. I was afraid that
in some one of these hours oj deep gloom and depres-
sion I should lift my hand against my own life, for
I knew that many had done so from the same cause.”
The dark hours became a time of terror to him, so
he says. He tossed and tumbled on his bed,
wondering if morning would ever dawn again. In
this case it was not an accusing conscience, as he
had committed no offence ; the cause was purely
a physical one —yet, all too common in England—
indigestion and dyspepsia, with the long chain of
i consequences dragging after it, nervous collapse
among them.
He relates that his skin and eyes had been more
or less discoloured for years, often of a ghastly
and repulsive yellow. This was due to the presence
of bile in the blood and tissues, where it had no
business to be. But as the weak and torpid liver
could not remove it, no other result was possible
than the one our friend experienced. His head
frequently ached as though fiends had turned it
into a workshop, and pains chased one another
through his body as though he had at least half
the maladies catalogued in the popular books of
disease.
Yet one thing, and one only, was responsible
for all the mischief, namely, the poison introduced
into the blood from the decaying food in the
stomach and intestines. The cold feet, the loss
of appetite and ambition, the mental despondency,
the sense of weariness and fatigue, the bad taste
in the mouth, dry cough, giddiness, palpitation,
chills, weakness, &e., are a brood of foul birds
hatched in one nest, and the mother is always
indigestion and dyspepsia.
Time passed somehow, as it always does,
whether we laugh or cry, and this man grew
heartily tired of a life thus burdened and spoiled.
He longed to see the end of it, and no wonder.
But the last page of his letter is pitched in a
higher key. He says, “ When I think of what
I was, and what I am now, I can hardly realise
the change. For the past six months I have been
using a preparation known as Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup, and it has actually revolutionised
my whole system. One of my tenants recom-
mended it to me, and I tried it just to please him.
Now I praise it for myself, and thank the men
who made and advertise it. My troubles are over,
and I feel (at 57) as light, elastic, and gay as a
boy on his summer vacation. I tell my doctors
they are beaten at their own trade by an old
German nurse, and so far as I am concerned they
can’t deny it. I have no more horrible thoughts
of self-destruction, for I find too much enjoyment
in living. My thanks are too deep for words.”
The author of tins letter consents to the pub-
lication of so much of it as is here printed, but
declines to allow the use of his name, at least for
the present, for reasons we are bound to respect.
But the evident sincerity of his story will carry
conviction to every candid mind.

willing to recommend soap. lam told that my
commendation of Pears’ Soap has opened for it

to stand by every word in favour of it that I ever

Sir ERASMUS WILSON, F.R.S.

England.)
Writes in the Journal of Cutaneous Medicine ;
“The use of a good soap is certainly calculated
to preserve the skin in health, to maintain its
complexion and tone, and prevent its falling into
wrinkles . . . PEARS is a name engraven on
the memory of the oldest inhabitant; and Pears’
Transparent Soap is an article of the nicest and
most careful manufacture, and one of the most
refreshing and agreeable of balms for the skin.” .

The New Dummyism.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
New South Wales dumipying is not done quite
so openly as it used to be ; but in the perpetual
struggle with the Land Act the squatter still
manages to keep well in the leach In the good
old times the game of grab was a comparatively
simple matter. Incurables from the hospitals
were sent forth to subdue the wilderness with
all the rations they needed in this world packed
inside a jerry-built dwelling, little roomier than
a coffin and scarcely more comfortable. The
generous squatter provided the necessary
capital, made out applications, and carefully
drilled his tools for the parts they had to play
before the land-court. Each man as he passed
the ordeal was carted out to the little sentry-
box provided for him, wherein he sat down to
enjoy the pleasure of being “settled on the
land,” as provided by the Act. The squatter’s
next care was to see the whole batch firmly
settled in the land. As a rule he waited
patiently for the reward of Christian charity.
These free selectors were guaranteed not to out-
last their rations, and all of them bequeathed
their little blocks to their benefactor in con-
sideration of unlimited rum and tobacco. Men
doomed by the doctors have been known to
recover, but in these cases rum and sheep-wash
tobacco rendered permanent recovery to health
impossible. Now the good old days when the
squatters acquired the earth by planting
derelicts “ ’neath the wattle ” have vanished.
* # «
Nowadays, the N.S. W. Land Act is very
constantly revised, and, therefore, just when the
philanthropic squatters have discovered the
loophole always left for them, a new Act
warranted dummy - proof is passed, and
again they groan, like the crushed
tragedian, “More Study!” Meantime, the
present Act is a perfect “throw-in” for the
lords of jumbuckdora. It allows the selector
who has served his sentence of “five years’
hard ” on a goat-paddock — i.e. , 40 acres, to
increase it to 2560 acres, in the Central Divi-
sion, without further residence. Presumably,
this clause was intended to apply solely to
the selector, who, having served his sentence on
40 acres, is entitled to increase it to the same
amount as the man whose capital enabled him
to start with the full area allowed by the Act,
but, in any case, it was not long before the
squatters commenced to work it for all it is
worth against natural enemy, the hona-Jlde
selector.
# # *
To old “Jacky” Hardswear, who devoted
every Sunday for years to the study of the Act,
the honour of discovering this loophole is due.
He bought up all the old forty-acre blocks in his
N.S.W. stations, and, on the strength of the
residence having been fulfilled by somebody,
alive or dead, applied for additional C.P.’s or
C.L.’s to the full amount to he added to each of
them. The applications were at first objected
to, but “Jacky” stood his ground upon the
strict wording of the clause, and triumphed. In
addition to other advantages this clause reduces
the cost and risk of dummying to a minimum.
In putting a dummy on a “ six-fortv ” the
squatter risked a fair amount of cash.
He required a man in whom the elements
of kna^ery and idiocy were equallv blended>
but ifc ' ften happened that the former
shifted the bean upset all the Bquattep . s
calculations . Apropos, the following true bill:
A Gwydip squ^ te " r uamed - well, Brown,
bought out a cockie (one Smith). After the
sale Brown asked Smith to dummy for him.
The grass parrot agreed, and with £BO of the
Bquatter > s inoney selected a paddock not far
from his home stead. Smith drew his “note
and rasllilis » regu larly, and spent most of his
time f encing and improving the land until the
five , residence had expired. Just about
the time when he got his certificate the squatter
, waB foolish enough to bully Mrs. Smith for
allowing some f rie nds to put their horses in the
paddock duril]g her h usb and’s absence. Smith
thereupon swore revenge. Whether he would
have transferred the itnd to his employer in
case is to doubt , but that he did not
is known to everyone in the district. He met
Brown outside the Land-office on the day he
had promise d to make the transfer, and said :
.. IVe sold n Bele ction, and here’s your share
of it .» Brown’s share was just £BO-without
interest and Smith still relates with pride how
he t .. a note a week and ra , sllu , s for im-
poundin - his own land y>
# # #
Mr Brown now employs only 40-acre dum-
mieB> If they “take him down ” he doesn’t
lose much, and if they run straight and “sell
out ” to him—they mostly do, the temptation
being small—Brown works the “ Jacky ” Hard-
swear clause, and sets the balance of the full
area added without' further residence. A few
40-acre dummies judiciously arranged along a
water-frontage will lock-up miles of the country
behind them, and scare away any “damned
selectah ” who hasn’t a thousand or two in hand
to spend upon tanks and wells,
* # #
A curious fact about dummying is that every-
body cau de tect it, save those who are paid by
Government to do so. Perjury before a Land
Board passes without comment, even when it is
practically admitted. The Board only occasion-
any refuses an application that has been made
[ n due form, for land available for selection,
when all the usual questions put to the appli-
cant on oath have been answered as required by
j aw . The refusal of any application simply
me ans that the would-be dummy perjured Uni-
self so clumsily that even the Board could not
avoid seeing it. Yet we rarely hear of such
men being punished for perjury. Let any care-
ful observer attend a bush Land Court through
a three days’ sitting and he will hear more
calm, cold-blooded perjury than all the Metro-
politan police-courts could produce in a year,
A shock-headed specimen, with no forehead to
speak of, stands up for his preliminary examina-
tion. He is a bush carpenter. Recognises the
cross at the foot of the application produced as
his signature (he is not asked who filled the
paper up for him). All the answers to the
printed questions thereon are correct. No one
asked him to take the land up. He has had no
business transactions with the lessees on the
run he is selecting upon, excepting payments
made to him for contract-work. He intends to
use the land for bis own sole benefit He took

ters in court). Applicant has had no experience

Tl.c money ho deposited with his appli-
Ccitioii av cis edi ned by hiiuselr. Just heie a
spreads over the court and the applicant grins
himself, until, catching a certain squatter’s eye,
he suddenly closes his mouth and assumes an
expression of profound gravity. The joke is
t . , ■’ ~
that every soul in court, except, perhaps, the
chairman of the Board, knows that the appli-
cant hasn’t held the price of a “Jimmy

\\ oodser for a month previous to his appear-
ance as a selector. However, after a guileless
old gentleman on the bench has been consulted
by the chairman, as a mere matter of form, the

applicant is informed that the land is passed for
survey. Then the latest addition to “ our bold
peasantry, their country’s pride,” departs to
float 1-ii’a nerinrerl sra.l in vmr*

The only difficulty a dummy has to solve
i • . J . .. . . , .
nowadays is to account tor his sudden accession
to wealth. In a small community where his
pecuniary resources are known to be extremely
limited he requires to break the news very
gently. The old-time legacy from an ancient
and obscure relative, has been worn so thin that
even a Land Board sniffs incredulously at it,

taking Hie question by and large, it is
difficult to account for the weakness of the
squatter in employing dummies. It is a risky
1 i i J & mi i
and unproductive game. The man who will

adhere faithfully to a verbal agreement, and
not a few son a Hers have Ivpp„ fi,vinoinllu

w inked at in the .Land Courts, the squatter
will continue to grab the earth per medium of
dummies in 40-acre blocks, which can be ex-
tended, without further risk or residence, to
the full area allowed by the elastic Land Act
of New South Wales.
COCKATOO.
Matrimonial item :
Marriage, if not carried to excess, is a wise provision
and sacred obligation. Marry jour opposite as far as
possible, especially as regards sex. You will never regret
it. If possible, marry above your station. Both of j'ou
should do this. It is sure to advance your race. Do not
marry a foreigner unless highly recommended by those in
whom you have perfect confidence, or unites you want to
very much indeed. Do not encourage long engagements.
It is better to get Weary of each'other at j our leisure
after marriage than to do it beforehand. Courtship, how-
ever, is a most .delightful industry, and should not be
rashly broken in upon bj- marriage. Some people seem to
lie admirahlj-fitted for suitors, but faii in other occupa-
tions. Tins is very fortunate indeed. No suitor can be
sure of a permanent situation. The supply greatly exceeds
the demand.
Dear Bulletin, —You fall into the common
mistake of supposing that Home Rule without Parnell
must degenerate into Home Rule. As a Protestant, the
present member for Cork would ba the wrong leader in
the struggle which must inevitably arise between priests
and tire K.C. laity as soon ns Home Rule is granted. The
Irish, not half so'priest-ridden as the English, will deal
with .the Church as France did, but not under a Protes-
tant leader. Look at history. Before the Reformation
the Irish were the most turbulent of Catholics; in fact,
the English invasion was brought about at the i .stance of
the Rope. They had always been at variance with the
Vatican. But they refused to accept the Reformation at
England’s dictation. The more they were urged to break
away by outsiders the closer they clung to an allegiance
to which they had previously been lukewarm. Much the
same thing would happen now if Parnell were mad enough
to start an anti Papal crusade-and the man seems mad
enough for anything. Which reminds me that Baron
Congleton, the most illustrious of the Parnell family,
committed suicide, and that other members died lunatic's.'
Don’t make a mistake in thinking that men like Dillon",
Sexton, O’Brien, Heidv, the M'Carthys, the O’Connors
(Arthur and T. P.), &c., will ever be priest-ridden,—

The Disappearance of Molloy.
AN INCONCLUSIVE STORY.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Down on the Starlight Flat, at Christmas-
tide five-and-thirty years ago, the leading store
was that of a firm named Grant and Molloy, who
did a thriving trade and were the largest gold-
buyers on the field.
Grant was a widower with only one child, an
attractive girl of 18 or 19 years, with a wealth of
brown hair and loving blue eyes—and, better still,
a generous and kindly disposition. Nelly Grant
was her father’s housekeeper, comforter, and in-
separable companion, and, in truth, the very
apple of his eye. An apple which, it goes without
saying, was sorely coveted by all the young
fellows in the neighbourhood; and endless were
the cunning excuses invented for a visit to the
store, just for the chance of a bright smile or
pleasant greeting from pretty Nellie. But, al-
though the young girl smiled kindly upon her
host of earnest wooers, she seemed insensible to
the blandishments of all, save one —young Tom
Daley.
Tom was a fine young fellow of six or seven-
and-twenty. He had been a clerk in a Melbourne
house for some years previous to the opening cf
the “ Starlight,” but, like thousands of others,
unable to resist the temptations of the glovying
accounts constantly arriving from the new field,
he had thrown up his situation and hastened off
to the “ rush,” hopeful of falling across one of the
big nuggets or rich patches of which he had heard
so much. And, although it was an open secret at
the “Nob” that he had garnered a better treasure
than either in the shape of Nellie’s love, his ill-
success in gold-digging was a sad damper to his
happiness ; for Tom was poor—and proud—and
far too fond of the girl to speak out just yet. But
Tom worked away steadily, in the hope of “strik-
ing it heavy ” some day soon.
# # #
Although Starlight Flat had been given a
marvellous riddling, and was now, in the main,
merely a “hatter’s” diggings, there were yet
many good patches only waiting some lucky stroke
of the pick; outside “ streaks” still undiscovered;
Carelessly-worked ground and so forth, for the
held had been as extensive as rich, and Tom had
good grounds for his hopes.
Being Christinas time, all hands had “washed
up” and disposed of their gold, in preparation for
the coming festivities. A large quantity had been
Purchased by “Grant and Molloy,” including
some very fine nuggets, in all amounting to
2500 z. Now, the nearest bank being in a town
distant some miles or so from the “Nob,” it was
Grant’s custom to drive thither himself periodi-
cally, sell his gold, and return with the money on
the following day. On this particular occasion,
however, it was arranged that Molloy, the junior
Partner, should go in his stead. Accordingly on
Boxing Day morning, 185 G, the gold was emptied
>nto a large scoop, sifted and thoroughly cleansed.
and finally weighed and returned to the chamois
and sealed. All this took place at the open
counter in the presence of Tom Daley and Nellie,
who were admiring the strange shapes of the
nuggets, and conversing with Molloy as he sifted
the fine gold while Grant was passing to and fro
attending to the customers, who proved to be
pretty numerous on that particular morning.
Whilst in the vicinity of the trio his attention was
directed by Nellie to a very remarkable-looking
“speck” which Molloy had just weighed and
declared to be 2dwts. It was a thin, flat nugget,
hollow in the centre, and in shape exactly
resembled a heart.
# * *
Grant took it into his hand and examined
it closely. He was just remarking that he had
not observed it before, when he was called off by
a customer, and the incident passed away from
his memory. An hour later the gold having been
put into a valise and properly secured in the boot
of the buggy, Molloy, armed with a brace of
revolvers, took his departure for the bank.
Two days after, the buggy was picked up on
the ranges with bits of broken harness attached to
it, and brought to the store. Grant, in great con-
sternation, at once collected a party of volunteers,
whom he despatched to scour the country in a all
directions in search of Molloy, whilst he him-
self rode away to town in order to ascertain what
time his partner had left on his return journey.
Upon enquiring at the bank he found, to his
surprise, that Molloy had never presented himself
there, neither had anyone in the township seen or
heard anything of him. Interviewing the
authorities, he communicated all the circum-
stances of the case, and being assured by the
Inspector that no time would be lost in making a
thorough investigation, there was nothing else to
be done but return home and see if anything fresh
had happened in that quarter. On arrival he
learned that nothing had been seen in any way to
account for the disappearance of Molloy and his
valise. Poor Grant was at his wits’ end. He had
a sincere regard for his partner, who had been in
his employ for a number of years previous to his
receiving a small interest in the business, and
never questioned his probity, therefore he
had little doubt that he had been murdered
for the sake of the gold by some of the
numerous out-throats who infested the bush.
The loss of so large a sum of money was,
however, a serious matter, and would certainly
cripple his business, for, though well above the
world, he was by no means wealthy. However,
there was nothing to be done but to await with
patience the result of the investigations of the
police, but, though neither time nor trouble was
spared in the endeavour to discover the missing
man, no trace could be found. Molloy had dis-
appeared as effectually as if he had been spirited
away; and as time sped on the diggers at the
“Nob’’ceased to speculate on the matter, until
at length, like many other mysteries, it became
“forgotten history.”
11.
The Heart-shaped Speck.
Twelve months had passed away and
Christmas was again at hand. Tom Daley’s suit
had prospered amazingly, for he and Nelly were
to be married early in the coming year. Tom
had —in digging parlance —“struck the jugular,”
3oz. to the tub, no less. The ground was virgin,
and but six feet deep, and, having no mate, lie
had the claim all to himself. Of course, the whole
community had swarmed around him ; hundreds
of shafts had been sunk, but not a single one of
them had bottomed on gold ; no, hardly even so
much as the “ colour.” Such a completely isolated
patch was hitherto unexampled in Starlight 3*lat.
So, after riddling and cutting the ground in alt
directions without finding gold, the diggers bad
reluctantly “given it best,’’and for the last few
weeks Tom had been sole occupant of the ground.
The patch, although very rich, had, however, ex-
tended over but a small area of ground, and he
had now nearly worked it out. He had just
handed to Grant the result of his last week’s work,
and passed through the store_ into the dwelling-
house behind to have a chat with Nelly, while her
father washed and cleaned the gold and weighed
it. Grant emptied the gold into a scoop and pro-
ceeded to shake it about and examine it in the’
usual way. It was a coarse, shotty sample, in-
cluding a number of biggish specks of various
sizes ; some of them would have to go into the’
mortar presently, having bits of ironstone attached.
All at once he laid down the scoop, and, going
to the passage communicating with the house,
listened. Sounds of low rippling laughter were
wafted to his ear. The young couple were having
a good time. He made a movement as if he would
pass through and join them ; then turned, closed
the door, and went back to the scoop. Picking up
one of the bigger bits of gold he held it up to the
light and scrutinised it minutely, then put it into'
the scale and weighed it—it was exactly two-
pennyweights. Beyond a doubt, it was the’
“ heart-shaped speck.”
The whole scene of 12 months ago came vividly
before him. He recollected clearly the weight of
the “ speck ” and his own curious examination of
it, every particular stood out as clear as in a vision,
but—win nee this fearful re-appearance of the’
heart-shaped speck ?
A rush of hideous ideas took his breath away
and made his brain reel. Whilst trying to 1
recover himself and collect his thoughts the door
of the passage opened and Tom entered with a
smile. “ Well,” he began, “how about the gold?'
But,” he continued, “I see you are busy, and
won’t interrupt you. I’ll be over early to-morrow
to take Nell to the picnic.” And with a cheery
look in his eyes Tom passed out, giving his future
father-in-law a friendly nod as he went.
But Grant, who, on hearing Tom’s step, hastily
opened his ledger, averted his face, and uttered 1 ,
never a word. He moved slowly to the doorway,
and leaning wearily against the sill looked after
the slight young figure stopping briskly along in
the sunshine. He went back carefully over his
two years’ acquaintance with Tom ; remembered
his unvarying generosity and self-denial; and,
above all, his manly, straightforward conduct in
his relations with Nellie; and as hedwelton these
two things, his mind grew calmer, and the fright-
ful suspicions so suddenly engendered by his
recognition of the little nugget seemed out of all
reason j little short of madness indeed. Still,
supposing Tom to be free from all complicity ini
the robbery—if not murder—of the missing
Molloy, what theory would possibly account for
the possession of the piece of gold ? Sorely exer-
cised by these conflicting conjectures, he turned!
to his books, and, adding up the amount of gold
which he had purchased from Tom during the last
two months found, to his further consternation,
that it weighed within a trifle of 2500z5., the exact
quantity carried aioay by Molloy.
Pondering upon this most ominous coincidence,
the singularly isolated character of Tom’s
“ patch ” recurred to him in a new and convincing
aspect. Dwelling upon these dircfully significant
incidents, a multitude of trifling circumstances
flashed through his mind—trifling when considers
by themselves ; but which, read in the lurid ligh
of later developments, united in forging such a
chain of evidence against Tom as would surely
admit of only one interpretation. The whole
tory seemed clear enough now. Tom’s cupidity,
aroused by the sight of the large quantity of gold,
the comparative ease by which he might become
possessed of it, thus removing the chief obstacle
to the gratification of his love; his interception
and murder of the unfortunate Molloy near the
deserted old workings, and his ready disposal of
the body in one of the deep, wet holes which, in
the nature of things, would prove a sure and un-
discoverable grave; and finally his pretended
discovery in “ Duffer’s Gully,” as it had been
dubbed by the disappointed diggers. Then, as to
his inexplicable retention and disposal of the
“ small nugget,” of whose easy identification he
must have been aware—it could only be another
of those unaccountable oversights so common in
the most ingeniously-concerted crimes ; confirming
the truth of the old saying that “ murder will
out.” Great Heavens! what a providential escape
for his child !
Then the thought of the probable effect upon
poor Nellie, of the dreadful revelation, brought a
tear to his eye. But whatever unfortunate conse-
quences might ensue, his course was clear and
inevitable. He must prevent all future communi-
cation between his daughter and Tom, and take
steps to have the latter arrested at once. Reason-
ing thus, but loth to make the first move, Grant
paced backward and forward in front of the store
all the afternoon, nodding mechanically once in a
way to some passing acquaintance, and deli-
berating anxiously as to the best way of breaking
the news to his daughter.
* « •
Tom Daley, unconscious of the tempest
■of emotions rending the breast of his prospective
father-in-law, was unwittingly about to precipi-
tate matters in an entirely unsuspected way. He
had eaten his supper and was busily engaged in
ransacking the pockets of sundry cast-off trousers
and waistcoats in search of some article, the
absence of which seemed to puzzle him greatly,
when all of a sudden he dropped the old clothes
and, putting on his hat, started for the store.
Although still early, on arrival, somewhat to his
surprise he found it closed ; but this, as may be
;supposed, was a matter of small moment to Tom,
who betook himself to the door of the private
•dwelling, and knocked.

Grant had, in the interim, written a note
to the Inspector of Police, requesting his presence
at as early a date as might be convenient, in order
to receive some important information in reference
to the mysterious disappearance of his late partner,
Molloy. This, he felt, was as far as he could
bring himself to go in the matter at present, for in
spite of the manifest guilt of Tom Daley, so great
was the conflict in his mind that the initial step
he had taken to bring him to justice had been
attended by some sharp pangs of remorse. He
felt quite unequal to the task of broaching the
subject to his daughter, and being completely
tired out, had closed the store and retired to his
room in search of sleep.

On being admitted, Tom found Nellie and
a companion deeply immersed in the congenial
occupation of inspecting and discussing the rela-
tive merits of a number of articles of feminine
finery strewn upon the table, and explained as the
cause of his unexpected visit that he had mislaid

Twenty Years in the study and practice of

Of Men and Women in the leading Medical Schools and!
Hospitals of Great Britain, Paris, Berlin and Vienna, and
in pm'ate practice. Formerly House Surgeon to the
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Maternity and Lock Hospitals.
No medical man advertising in these colonies has medical!
degrees which can he compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the
ONLY LEGALLY QUALIFIED DOCTOR
advertising in these colonies who combines with special
Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those'
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old,

cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,,
specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened!

tism,impure blood, weakeningdischarges, impaired

NERVOUS DEBILITY, shoidd lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-
cines will be forwarded to them. On receipt of

Generative Function in Health and Disease,”

Dr. Alex. Paterson,
201 Macquarie Street North (opposite Parliament House)
his long-treasured speck, that he had searched for
it everywhere without success, and that as a last
resource he had come to see if by any chance it
had got amongst the gold he had left with her
father in the morning. Nellie rose sympatheti-
cally and went to enquire. She was gone, Tom
thought, for an unusfial length of time for so sim-
ple an errand, and on her return her face bore a
strangely thoughtful and puzzled expression. She
was followed immediately by her father, who,
somewhat to that young gentleman’s surprise,
shook hands with an unexampled exuberance and
warmth. _ After a long and pleasant evening’s
conversation, Tom returned to his own little homo
highly elated in spirits, and with the fateful speck
snugly secured in his pocket.
* # #
It is only needful to say that the substance
of Nellie’s communication to her father was to the
effect that the “ heart-shaped speck ” had been in
Tom’s possession for many months prior to the
despatch of Molloy with the gold ; that he had,
at Nellie’s request, shown it to the missing man,
who had put it into the scales out of curiosity,
and that if Grant had not been so suddenly called
away he would have learned all about it.
* * #
Tom and Nellie were married in due
course, and although neither of them ever under-
stood the mental suffering it had cost Grant, the
heart-shaped speck is still in their possession, and
will doubtless be handed down to generations of
Daleys indefinitely. Many years ago a rumour
reached Grant, to the effect that his partner had
been met with in New Zealand by some old
acquaintance fropi the “ Nob,” but, otherwise,
nothing authentic has ever transpired to account
in any way for the disappearance of Molloy.
J. LYALL.
Maxim, the Yankee gun-inventor, has
built, or is building, the long-desired flying-
machine, which is to overturn the world. It is to
be a species of very light locomotive, and when it
starts on its wild career will run along the surface
of the earth like any other vehicle. At 25 miles
an hour, however, it will begin to jump and mani-
fest a desire to rise; at 30 miles, it will skim
along, only grazing the earth occasionally ; and at
35 miles it will rear up and strrt into the air. The
inventor says : “If I can rise from the coast of
France, sail through the air across the Channel,
and drop half-a-ton of nitro glycerine upon an
English city, I can revolutionise the world. ” This
seems an eminently probable statement, too.
Half-a-ton of nitro-glycerine, dropped in the right
place, would wipe out any empire nowadays.
One of the curiosities of Sydney is an
eminent legal luminary, who may be seen any
day trotting contentedly down the street, with
papers falling promiscuously out of all his pockets.
He is full of papers and manuscript and all sorts
of written matter, and he slops over with them,
and sheds them wherever he goes. Anybody can
make him drop about eighteen writs and duns
and lawyers’ letters by simply rushing a horse at
him when he is negotiating a busy crossing, and
making him run, for when he runs it shakes the
literature out of him. The people who pick up
the documents generally grin a broad, capacious
grin, and carry them round to the nearest news-
paper-office. Twice this week the legal gentleman
bolted across Pitt-street, and each time the bill he
dropped was brought to The Bulletin. The first
time it was a liquor bill for £lO or so, with a
peremptory memo, at the foot demanding the
cash. The next time it was the same liquor bill,
with a more peremptory memo, at the foot, stating
that the firm’s lawyer was about to “ take pro-
ceedings.” We are now waiting for the old man
to run across the street a third time, and drop the
writ, and then the series will be complete.

“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the publiito
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering fi’om the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.

CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, 1880.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned :
“1 have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
in my sysifuii, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afffeted as I have
been may take advantage of them.
“ I remain, dear sirs,

An Evening in Dandaloo.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was while we held our races
Hurdles, sprints and steeplechases—
Up in Dandaloo,
That a crowd of Sydney stealers,
Jockeys, pugilists and spielers
Brought some horses, real heelers,
Came and put us through.
Beat our nags and won our money.
Made the game by no means funny,
Made us rather blue ;
When the racing was concluded,
Of our hard-earned coin denuded
Dandaloonies sat and brooded
There in Dandaloo.
• .»•••«
Night came down on Johnson’s shanty
Where the grog was no means scanty,
And a tumult grew
Till some wild, excited person
Galloped down the township cursing,
“ Sydney push have mobbed Macpherson,
Roll up, Dandaloo ! ”
Great St. Denis ! what commotion !
Like the rush of stormy ocean
Riery horsemen flew.
Dust and smoke and din and rattle,
Down the street they spurred their cattle
To the war-cry of the battle,
“Wade in, Dandaloo ! ”
So the boys might have their fight out,
Johnson blew the bar-room light out.
Then, in haste, withdrew.
And in darkness and in doubting
Raged the conflict and the shouting,
“ Give the Sydney push a clouting,
“ Go it, Dandaloo !”
Jack Macpherson seized a bucket,
Every head he saw he struck it—
Struck in earnest, too;
And a man from Lower Wattle,
Whom a shearer tried to throttle,
Hit out freely with a bottle,
There in Dandaloo.
Skin and hair were flying thickly,
When a light was fetched, and quickly
Brought a fact to view—
On the scene of the diversion
Every single, solid person
Came along to help Macpherson—
AH were Dandaloo !
When the list of slain was tabled,
Sonic were drunk and some disabled,
Still we found it true.
In the darkness and the smother
We’d been belting one another,
Jack Macpherson bashed his brother,
There in Dandaloo.
So we drank, and all departed—
How the “ mobbing” yarn was started
No one ever knew —
And the stockmen tell the story
Of that conflict fierce and gory,
How We fought for love and glory
Up in Dandaloo.
It’s a proverb now, or near it—
At the races you can hear it,
At the dog-fights, too ;
Every shrieking, dancing drover
As the canines topple over,
Yells applause to Grip or Rover,
“ Give him ‘ Dandaloo ’! ’
And the teamster slowly toiling
Through the deep black country soiling
Wheels and axles, too,
Lays the whip on Spot and Banker,
Rouses Tarboy with a flanker—
‘Redman ! Ginger 1 Heave there ! Yank her !”
“ Wade in, Dandaloo !”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On the track where travellers so,
Silent and sad and slow,
By the well where the drovers rest,
In the sun of the hot North-West;
On the plains where the stockmen meet,
By the camp-fire’s dying light;
On the hills where the miners throng,
In the city’s busy street.
In the daytime, in the night,
A voice comes clear and strong—
And the traveller halts in his stride,
Though but half the day be done ;
And the horsemen pause in their ride
In the blaze of the noonday sun.
In the heart of the city’s life,
On the trackless plain,
Workers waging their strife
For a pitiful gain ;
Hest for a minute then,
At the sound of the voice.
“Listen, O men, that are men,
In your hearts rejoice.
“ To-day is the day of days,” it said,
“ For the people have broken their thrall,
And hopes are living that erst were dead,
And lies, in the countless ages bred,
Are doomed in their time to fall.
Vo have waited long, not taking heed,
Whilst traitors misruled in your place ;
But right prevails in the hour of need,
And a brutal law and a rich man’s greed
Ye have fought them face to face.
Fought them and beaten them. Who says nay?
Though the battle be not yet won,
Ve have struggled free from a tyrant sway—
Be true to yourselves as ye have this day,
And the rule of misrule is done.
“The future is yours, and the power
_ To make and unmake and reign ;
But success comes not in an hour,
And is victory bought without pain?
Struggle on, struggle on to the goal,
Ye shall lead who have long been led.”
And the workers listened with steadfast soul—
“ 'Ve will conquer or die,” they said.

Te Anau Lake.
The following verses are said to have been com-
posed on the lake at Te Anau, N.Z., by “an
eminent Australian lawyer.” They are (this
isn’t saying much, perhaps) the best verses yet by
any Australian lawyer, that we know of, from
Judgoßarron Field down :
The wistful waters wander at the base
Of Anau’s brawny breast:
The virgin snow enclasps with cold embrace
His towering crest.
The tall hills stand along the watery way
As guards before a king:
Rob’d with soft foliage where sunbeams play,
And shadows cling.
Here the forgotten gods descend in mist
To bathe a sunny hour,
And softly lave their white wings where they kiss’d
The Rata’s flower.
I know not whether tenor ruled thy birth
O ! lake of Titian face,
Or beauty thought to bring at once to earth
Her every grace ;
Or both combined, to show to mortal eyes
How deep the mystery
Which living things and dead things imdeil'. s
Eternally;
And how, beyond the music of the tide,
The vvitcher3’ °f the snow
The gold of sunset on the mountain si.ia
And woods below.
The full-voiced whistle of the rising lark,
The torrents’ sullen roar,
Is that which must remain a riddle dark
For evermore.
Oh ! lake ; illusion was the name so meet,
They gave thy bosom fair,
And near, thy note of sorrow doth repeat
Thy deep despair.
Joe Chamberlain summed up :
Joseph Chamberlain smiles ; he does not laugh. Ilis
smile is peculiarly unsatisfactory, as if an adder had taken
to grinning. Mr. Chamberlain, too, lias a wandering and
uneasy eye, and a habit of glancing furtively around him,
as if he expected each moment to be arrested. Chamber-
lain is chiefly known by his bitter advocacy of the coercion
of the Irish democracy. He began life as a debating
society Tory. Then he became a Republican ; and now he
has re-joined the Tory party. All his inclinations, man-
ners, and dealings savour of the shoddy middle-class
whose god is wealth, and who look upon Heaven as a
place where special stalls are reserved for themselves.
The sky will fall when anybody trusts Mr. Chamberlain,
but the sky is not likely to fall.
France and England have entered into a
solemn agreement to respect each other’s mail-
boats in time of war, that the widows and orphans
of either side may promptly receive the dying
messages of the respective heaps of slain. This is
a genteel but utterly mischievous compact, because
the original idea in going to war was to make the
enemy sick, and any practice which tends to
upset commerce, and make both enemies sick as
soon as possible, ought to be maintained, not
abolished. Governments seem to want to trim
and polish campaigns, and wipe up the gore with
a clean wet flannel, so as to give them quite a
decent appearance. Out upon such sugar-coated
barbarism ! Give us one good war in all its
native hideousness - prisoners burnt alive, the
wounded left to rot, women and children tortured
to death, every possible house, crop, bridge, dumb
animal, and parson destroyed—and civilisation
would cry off battles once and forever. The
modern majah - general with his talk about
chivalry and pretence of converting wars into
picnics, is a contemptible beast as compared with
a naked Zulu, who shoves his spear into every
available member of the nation that is trying to
wipe him out.
There was a large, fat, sleepy individual in
the Melbourne express the other night, and he
had a ticket for Wodonga, which was the next
stopping place. He looked like a man who
intended to wake up and get his traps together at
the last moment, but meanwhile he lay in a
reposeful attitude on the seat. His boots were off,
to ease his corns most likely, and he had seven
packages, and a gun, and an overcoat. Presently
he woke with a frantic start to find the train just
stopping. Then he evidently concluded that he
had been sleeping for the last twenty miles, and he
made a grab at the luggage, and tried to get a
boot on one foot and a parcel on the other. Next
he dropped the parcel and grabbed for the other
boot, and the parcel burst through the fall, and
scattered a quantity of underclothing ail over the
place. He got the boots on the wrong feet, and
shoved the underclothing in his pockets, and
grabbed for the gun and some more parcels.
Just then the train started again, and with a
whoop of rage and excitement he launched him-
self at the door, amid a perfect cataract of
packages all bursting open in mid-air. He
landed on the platform in a sitting position, and
surveyed the wreckage. The gun was damaged,
and the overcoat had a tear down the back ; bis
hat was left behind in the train; a quantity of tea
and other provisions were spilt around loosely on
the platform; it was raining like thunder, and
there was no town in sight. The express had
stopped for a moment to breathe, and he had
thrown himself out into an empty wilderness
thirteen miles from anywhere in particular, and
there he was left—a distracted fat man in a great
desolation of grass, with never a bed or a pub or a
square meal in sight. I

The Tongan Parliament has abolished all
legal redress for debt. In that favoured land
there are now no more bills or p.n’s or 1.0 IPs, for
they are waste paper, every one. If anybody lets
anybody else have goods on tick he must trust to
Providence for the cash. There are no more time-
payment pianos or sewing-machines, or cheap
instalment furniture, or drinks that are chalked
up ; and nobody can go bankrupt, for to go bank-
rupt a man must owe something, and under the
new law nobody can owe anything in all Tonga.
It is a good and wise device, and the white man
should go and do likewise. Then there would be
no more calls recoverable in wild-cat mines, no
more land-speculation booms, no more part-books
or deferred-payment allotments, no more bills of
sale, no more flaring chromos. sold to the deluded
suburban female, to be paid for at Is. per weak,
no more anything, in fact; and everybody would
have a rest —a long, long, peaceful rest.

J. W. Lindt, of Melbourne, is going for a
trip to the Caroline Islands. When you are at
the Carolines it is prudent, ere you go ashore for a
walk, to entice on board your ship three or four
native chiefs, and let them know that unless you
are permitted to return alive they will be hanged
at the yard arm by the crew. Otherwise, you'are
very liable to be eaten. Should the nigs, eat
Lindt, they will, on the heathen theory that you
incorporate the spiritual qualities of the enemy
on whom you have dined, have a very high opinion
of themselves indeed.

“THE BULLETIN."
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonparell
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletsn,”
Premier A mtralian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dig
tinctive Australian National Policy. 1
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
ißate Revenue 'derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
-Ihe Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
■ The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
Ihe Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
ar-d has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established .Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claiu’i
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the moSt
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official— that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than anv
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SWORN CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, blit I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter jT
was expectoratingevery day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
©nd of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.
