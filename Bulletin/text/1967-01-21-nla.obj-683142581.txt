Is Anyone Listening?
IT is at first tempting to ignore
Mr. Arthur Calwell’s almost
daily fulminations against the visit
of Premier Ky, dismissing them as
the last egotistic desire for publicity
of a sadly senile political failure.
The style and temper of his lan-
guage is such that a foreign ob-
server might think him a partici-
pant (Albanian perhaps) in the
current Chinese ructions and the
charges he makes are so ridiculous
as to hardly warrant an attempt at
serious refutation. Yet, this must
be done. It is just possible that
some people may still be listening
to what he is saying.
The first point is that Premier
Ky is not a military dictator. His
powers are limited and he must
act with very serious regard to the
views and interests of a great
variety of contending social
groups. If the Government is not
elected —• as Britain’s wartime
Government was not it operates
within a political atmosphere in
which workers are free to organise
their trade unions and are free to
strike; in which Buddhists and
students are free to voice demands
and march the streets in demonstra-
tion and, in fact, do so; and in
which, despite Press censorship,
there is a great deal of freedom of
speech.
The second point is that Premier
Ky did not come to power through
a coup. On the contrary, he first
entered politics when he moved
with other young generals to pre-
vent a coup (in September, 1964).
He became Prime Minister in the
middle of 1965 when the Head of
State asked him to take over power
after a prolonged crisis in the
civilian government.
The third point is that Ky was
in no way whatever involved, as
Mr. Calwell has repeatedly
charged, in the deaths of the Diem
family. All died long before Kv
wielded any relevant power.
The final point is that Ky is
trying to do most of the things
which true progressives wish him
do. He is injecting the element
of compromise into Vietnamese
politics, as shown by his handling
of the Buddhists and his resolution
of several Cabinet crises. He has
held the first free national elec-
tions ever in Vietnam, and put in
train adoption of a constitution
and the establishment of a repre-
sentative-elected Parliament. Poli-
tical opponents have not been
repressed. He has implemented
drastic monetary reforms and
initiated “revolutionary develop-
ment” to improve conditions in the
countryside. Millions of refugees:
are resettled. He has encouraged
reconciliation with Communists
who will lay down their arms by
offering them an amnesty, and
Government assistance to resume a
peaceful, civilised life.
There are serious blemishes in
his record, but hardly more than
could be expected given the history
of the country and the nature of
the war to which it is subjected.
But Mr. Calwell, in his hysteria, so
vilifies the non-Communists of
Vietnam that he would appear to-
prefer the lunacy and violence of
the alternative.
Despite this, Premier Ky will be
welcomed by Australians this week.
He is an imperfect man in an im-
perfect world, but he is at least
devoting his life to doing what he
can to eliminate some of the
imperfections. That is much more
than can now be said of Mr.
Calwell.


Face of the Week
The Federal Government released
Premier Ky’s itinerary, with few
public appearances in four Austra-
lian capitals. Federal Opposition
Leader Calwell was pledged to lead
four protest marches, after a week
of verbal attacks to which Premier
Ky replied “completely misin-
formed.” Century temperatures were
recorded frequently in all eastern
mainland States. The Australian
Teachers’ Federation held its 47th
annual conference in cooler Hobart,
where Premier Reece said the States
could no longer find the necessary
funds for all education needs. Sir
Hugh Ennor was appointed head of
the Commonwealth Department of
Education and Science. Francis
Chichester prepared for the second
half of his world voyage, saying he
was confident of success when his
sponsors offered him a release from
contracts.
In Sydney and Melbourne a total
of 36 people charged with murder
were remanded during the week. The
Australian Dairy Industry Council
met in Melbourne to plan its
$750,000 campaign against marg-
arine interests. In Brisbane the
Queensland Cabinet considered a
s39m. plan to redevelop 16 acres
of the city’s Roma St. area. J.C.
Williamson’s reported a loss of
$208,000 for the last financial year.
Opposition to the proposed hanging
of Ronald Ryan increased in Mel-
bourne, while his counsel, Mr. Opas,
Q.C., left for London and a Privy
Council appeal. The Victorian Police
arrested another two men in con-
nection with the forged $lO notes
case. The Australian Junior Cham-
bers of Commerce changed its name,
officially, to “The Jaycees.” The
18th National Music Camp began in
Adelaide.
★ ★ ★
The two main domestic airlines,
TAA and Ansett-ANA, agreed to
stagger the timetables of their flights
between Sydney and Melbourne. The
Army Department announced that
a total of 83 Australian servicemen
had died in Vietnam and 281 had
been wounded. There were strong
public protests against hooliganism
in Melbourne’s bayside suburbs. In
sport, the Wallabies beat England
23-11, and for a second time Ameri-
ca’s Cup challengers “Gretel” and
“Dame Pattie” were matched and
honors went to Melbourne’s “Dame
Pattie.” The Crown Prince of Swe-
den visited Perth as a crew member
of a Swedish cadet-training ship. In
N.S.W. there were union protests
when Premier Askin refused to see a
deputation representing 56,000 Gov-
ernment transport workers asking for
wage rises.
THIS AUSTRALIA
The Why of Ky’s Welcome
In recent weeks Mr. Holt has obviously thought a great deal about how to
handle Mr. Calwell’s diatribes against Premier Ky and the Government’s decision
to invite him to Australia.
At his Press conference last week
Mr. Holt drove home three points
firmly and effectively. The first was
that the visit would enable Australians
to make their own assessment of Nguyen
Cao Ky, his policies, and the issues for
which the Allies are fighting in
Vietnam.
The second, that it would enable the
representative of the Vietnamese people
to express their gratitude to Austra-
lians for the sacrifices being made in a
joint cause. And the third, that since
the Government of South Vietnam had
shown great hospitality to leading Aus-
tralians, there is a certain simple
courtesy in returning this hospitality by
receiving Vietnam’s Premier Ky.
Mr. Holt did not comment directly
on anything that Mr. Calwell has said.
However, he made observations which
bear on the position adopted by the
leader of the Labor Party.
He pointed out that Mr. Calwell had
last year accepted in principle the idea
of travelling to Vietnam to be an
official guest of its Government. Fol-
lowing his shooting incident he had
asked Mr. Whitlam to go in his place.
Mr. Whitlam had been received by
South Vietnamese Premier Ky, and
talked with him for over an hour. Later
he had been given an official reception
by the Foreign Minister, Dr. Tran Van
Do, and helped to travel the country
by the Government.
The clear implication was, of course,
that Mr. Calwell was showing great
inconsistency in being prepared to
accept Vietnamese help and hospitality
on behalf of the Labor Party, while
now he called for an official rebuff and
boycott.
Mr. Holt also commented on the
lack of full democratic rights in
Vietnam, saying:
“Most of us are sufficiently close
still to the events of World War II
to recall how we in Australia had to
put much of our democratic liberty in
storage for the duration, and the Gov-
ernment had to assume powers under
its National Security legislation of a
far-reaching kind. We recognised the
need for this in the emergency of war.
“Now here is a Government in a
country which is engaged in a war
closer to the actual business of adminis-
tration than we have ever experienced,
and indeed the U.K. had to experience,
where the head of Government and
his colleagues are in almost daily danger
of injury or assassination by terrorist
opponents.
“I think it is quite remarkable in
those conditions that the Government
should have pressed on as it vigorously
has with the effort to establish a Con-
tituent Assembly.”
PETER SAMUEL
Further Asian Involvement
From ALAN REID in Canberra.
Under the political leadership of Prime Minister Harold Holt, Australia is going
to get increasingly deeply involved in Asian affairs. The present visit of South
Vietnam s Premier, Air Vice-Marshal Ky, is only the beginning of the involvement.
This year Holt is planning visits
from Philippine, Thai, and Malayan
political leaders, and to travel himself
to some of the troubled spots of Asia.
In the light of this intended involve-
ment on a scale never previously
approached, it is worthwhile to
examine how Holt views Australia’s
relationship with Asia.
He sees involvement as inevitable,
and inescapable. But although he is
accused of following slavishly the
United States’ line—and he undoubtedly
identifies the U.S.-Australia alliance as
the solid rock foundation for all Aus-
tralian external policies Holt is in
some ways much broader in his
approach than the Americans.
A man with genuinely humanitarian
instincts, he is appalled by the poverty
of so many Asian countries, even when
expressed in coldly statistical terms. He
drew attention recently to a U.S. official
Department of Commerce publication
which claimed that Australia’s figure of
$U.5.167 of average output per person
per annum was the highest in the
region. Against this, Indonesia’s 70 dol-
lars, Burma’s 75 dollars, North Korea’s-
and North Vietnam’s 80 dollars, Paki-
stan’s 83 dollars, India’s 90 dollars,
South Korea’s 100 dollars, and Com-
munist China’s 105 dollars per person
per annum are pathetically meagre.
Like the Communists, Holt wants
change, the type of change that will
raise Asian living standards nearer to
those of more developed nations. Until
the economic situation is changed, Holt
believes that the area will continue as


a danger spot for world peace —which
he regards as indivisible.
But Holt does not want change ex-
ternally enforced, but rather internally
induced; not dictated by Communist
China but brought about under politi-
cal auspices that give some prospect of
wider influence upon the shape of gov-
ernment by ordinary people. Without a
halt to the limitless expansionary ambi-
tions of Communism, there can be no
stability in Asia, and without stability,
no real progress.
This is the concept which makes
Holt an ardent supporter of the Ameri-
can presence in South Vietnam. His
support in part stems from selfishness
(he believes that without the U.S.’s re-
straining presence in the area, Australia
must itself inevitably come under
threat). But he also has a vision of a
non-Communist Asia developing and
Premier Ky receives an Australian delegation in Saigon: centre, Mr. lan Sinclair;
right, Australian Charge d’Affaires Mr. Roy Fernandez
lifting living standards while sheltering
behind the United States’ shield in
Vietnam.
Holt is convinced that stability is
essential to produce the kind of non-
Communist prosperous Asia alongside
which Australia can live. Pointing out
that Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, For-
mosa, and Thailand were among the
Asian countries that had produced the
highest level of individual productive-
ness, Holt told an audience recently
that it was conspicuously in South East
Asian countries enjoying stability that
“we find development occurring, rapid
change, and reform and a sense of
national vitality.” But Holt is always
very careful to emphasise that what is
desired in South East Asia is stability,
not stagnation. “We don’t by stability
mean something passive, conservative,
or resistant to change,” he said recently.
“Our concept of stability is a pro-
gressive one. We want in this region a
constructive, assured environment . . .
in which public authority is an instru-
mentality of the public welfare and . . .
in which there is prospect of real par-
ticipation on a broad basis in economic
and social affairs.”
Holt, a professional but very human
politician, can see the imperfections
of some of the countries with which
Australia is associated in Asia. But
he can also see the immensity of the
problems, particularly for nations
which are struggling with the enormous
task of trying to establish institutions
akin to democratic ones in an area
where there is only a limited demo-
cratic tradition or none at all.
“We should not and must not go
into Asia self-righteously selling West-
ern concepts and ways of doing things
as the best and only course for these
countries who have a history and
tradition hundreds of years, perhaps
thousands of years, older than ours,”
he says. “And we must not assume that
ours has the only answers, and that
others must change fundamentally all
the things on which they have built
up their beliefs.”
Holt is prepared to court unpopu-
larity within his own country to help
out Asian countries he believes are
struggling to establish more demo-
cratic forms of government. He be-
lieves that Air Vice-Marshal Ky is
engaged on this struggle under the
most difficult circumstances in a war-
torn country.
While Ky is trying to do this, Holt
is prepared to give him a hand even
though it presents him with some
internal embarrassment. He believes
that Australia has to understand the
immensity of the problem of establish-
ing broadly based political institutions
in Asia, or otherwise its nations will
lose patience and accept policies that,
as Holt sees it, are unrealistic and
dangerous to Australia’s future.
An interesting aspect of Holt’s brief
period in the Prime Ministership is the
way in which he has emerged on the
policy side as his own Minister for
Foreign Affairs and foreign affairs
policy maker, particularly in respect to
Asia. External Affairs Minister Paul
Hasluck has been relegated almost to
a back seat. It is Holt rather than Has-
luck who is doing the thinking. As this
state of things is likely to continue,
even intensify, it is desirable to have at
least some idea of Holt’s approach to
the question that is obviously going to
bulk ever larger in Australian affairs—
its relationship with Asia.
A Strong Leader
Mr. Nguyen Van Thai, the editor and
publisher of Saigon’s leading magazine,
“Thoi Nay,” is on a visit to Australia.
THE BULLETIN interviewed him in
Canberra.
Q.: Mr. Thai, some rather bitter
things have recently been said here
about your Premier, Mr. Ky.
A.: I think you refer to the state-
ments of Mr. Calwell. He is obviously
not well informed about our country, to
which I think he has not been. The
death of Diem and his brothers was
nothing to do with Ky, as he was not
in power at the time.
Q.: Is Ky regarded by people in
Vietnam as a more popular leader or
just one in the series of military men
who have risen and fallen since Diem
went?
A.: He is quite well known by the
people, since he travels a great deal in
the countryside, and in Saigon he is
often watched on television. He is a
very good orator in Vietnamese, and
people are excited by his speeches.
Q.: How does he compare as a
speaker with some of the Buddhist
leaders who early last year rallied mass
movements with their oratory?
A.: I think Ky is better. Tri Quang,
for instance, speaks with a central
accent which is not as beautiful as Ky
with his northern accent. Ky is quite
a poetic speaker of great fluency. I
think he is gradually becoming popular.
He may have made some blunders
earlier, but he has generally succeeded,
overcome many crises, and remained.
The election of a National Assembly is
a good thing, an excellent start. A con-
stitution has been promised by the Viet-
namese New Year, which is February
9. I don’t know whether they will meet
the deadline, but there is no turning
back. Democratic institutions are taking
shape, and a lot more young people
have come into politics. But how far it
will be stable and successful we cannot
say. In a state of war it is particularly
difficult to run a democratic system.
Q.: This brings us to the question of
freedom of expression as it exists under
Premier Ky. Could you define the
limits within which there is freedom to
publicly criticise the Government.
A.: Ky has said many times that pro-
vided criticism is constructive and for
the good of the country he will allow
it and in practice he is personally quite
ready to accept criticism. He has given
specific instructions to the Ministry of
Information to that effect.
Q.: How does censorship work?
A.: Before anything is published, galley
proofs must go to the Ministry to be
approved. We do have difficulty some-


times, but we can appeal and surpris-
ingly we often get satisfaction.
Q.: What sort of things have been
censored from your magazine?
A.: Comments on relations between
Vietnamese people and Americans, the
behaviour of American soldiers, things
like that. Speaking generally there is
censorship of articles on military oper-
ations, and sex and love stories too.
Q.: Can you for instance write a frank
assessment of the revolutionary develop-
ment program? Can you expose corrup-
tion in government and such like?
A.: They are more or less free. Parts
will be censored if the editor cannot
prove the accuracy or produce solid
evidence. If an editor feels strongly
about a case he can usually fight and
win the right to publish it.
Q.: Does the Vietnamese Press in fact
come out and succeed in publishing
scandals reflecting on the Government?
A.: Oh, yes. Recently we had stories
about pilferage and robbery by officials
at Saigon Harbor and quite a few
police and officials were arrested as a
result. Of course we need greater
freedom. Certainly as an editor I be-
lieve that, and we journalists will try
to get it. But you must not think in
black and white. Because there are some
restrictions it does not mean that South
Vietnam is without freedom.
Q.: Opponents of Ky often quote
against him a statement reported in “Le
Monde,” that he admired Hitler.
A.: This statement was I think made
when there was a great political in-
stability in Saigon. Many people wanted
a strong leader who could appeal to
nationalist sentiment and apply disci-
pline. You must understand the state-
ment in that context. They wanted a
man of the drive and energy and rally-
ing power of Hitler, who, like the
Vietnamese, fought against the French.
I am sure Ky does not admire any of
Hitler’s other characteristics. He does
not display them.
Victoria’s ‘Vietniks’ and ‘Hangers’
Although Ronald Ryan’s hanging has been averted pending an appeal to the
Privy Council, there have been a number of developments in Victoria where
opposition to the proposed hanging is quietly mounting.
Ryan’s appeal is being prepared and
is evidently an extremely elaborate
and complex case. No date has been
set for the hearing, but most guesses
are that it will be at least two months
before the decision is known.
Meanwhile, a number of people in
Melbourne have confirmed reports that
the Chief Secretary, Sir Arthur Rylah,
is deeply opposed to the execution.
The Director General of Social Wel-
fare, who, in Orwellian style, is in
charge of organising execution prepa-
rations, is said to be vehemently
against it. So is the Governor of
Pentridge Gaol, Mr. Grindley.
Leading churchmen whom Sir Henry
Bolte has so far refused to meet,
have now appealed over his head to
members of his Cabinet in what is
described as a most powerful and
moving letter. It asks 16 pertinent
questions about the hanging decision
and ends by saying that silence and
inaction cannot be taken as avoidance
of moral responsibility.
A more unusual source of trouble
for the Victorian Government lies with
the jurors who found Ryan guilty.
One of them, shocked by the Govern-
ment’s decision to invoke the death
penalty, has contacted other jurors and
found that another six of the remain-
ing eleven agree that they would not
have returned a finding of “guilty”
had they ever thought a hanging
would result. They have, as a first step,
written a letter to the Premier saying
they “strenuously object” to the hang-
ing, and urging him to reconsider the
matter.
There are some signs that Cabinet
might renege. One of the Ministers
who voted for the hanging, Mr. Reid,
is overseas now and it is likely that
another “hanger” might desert. That
would give an 8-6 vote for a reprieve,
but the problem is that none of those
opposed to the hanging seems inclined
to challenge Sir Henry Bolte and call
for a vote on the matter. Sir Arthur
Rylah might be strong enough.
There is one ominous suggestion
around, namely, that Cabinet has
already given approval to a lightning
execution, immediately a Privy Council
rejection is announced. According
Ronald Ryan
to this, instructions have secretly been
given to the Director General of Social
Welfare to have his gallows in readi-
ness so that Ryan can be hanged
within 48 hours of the announcement.
Sir Henry Bolte has ironically had
a bit of luck in the coincidence of the
Ky visit with his hanging. When he
announced details of the hanging just
before Christmas, he right away moved
to discredit his critics by saying that
the people who would protest would
be just the dreary “Vietnik” crowd,
whom the elections showed so dramati-
cally have little public support. With
these people likely to perform before
the public again, Sir Henry will un-
doubtedly hope to link the anti-
hangers with the Left Wing Vietnik
protesters.
In fact, there is extremely little
similarity. Only one of the 30-odd
members of the anti-hanging commit-
tee is a protestor Mr. J. P. Ryan,
editor of the “Catholic Worker,” and
he is a rather apologetic, ambiguous
opponent of the Vietnam involvement.
Mr. Barry Jones, the president, says
he is “unhappy about the bungling,”
but in favor of the Vietnam involve-
ment generally. None of the others
has strong enough views on the sub-
ject to make a public stand.
Quite bizarre has been an opposite
juxtaposition of attitudes, in people
who might be described as Vietnik-
hangers. At least three of these were
prominent among the letters-to-the-
editor columns of the newspapers while
the debate raged. Another is the stern
former stipendary magistrate in the
Wimmera, Mr. P. R. Biggin, well
known to many newspaper readers for
his outspoken attacks on traffic offend-
ers and his severe sentences. Once he
hit the headlines by jailing for the night
a prominent Melbourne barrister.
Mr. Biggin recently wrote an article
for a local newspaper in which he de-
precated a “frantic obsession with Com-
munism” when a “vastly graver and
more immediate menace to Australia
is growing up within our shores . . .
a startling increase in heinous crime.”
Believing “there is no place for the
weakling or the theorist in dealing with
crime,” Mr. Biggin declared “the
criminal is a beast in human form,”
and he posed the following questions
“How can they still their voices about
the wholesale, hideous slaughter (in
Vietnam) with the bayonet and napalm,
yet hesitate not to abuse the process of
law and humiliate the government of
the State in order to save from a
humane death the vilest murderer who
ever fouled the history of Victoria?”
FETTER SAMUEL
No (Real) Choice
It was impossible for the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust to come out of Monday’s
crucial meeting with N.S.W. Works
Minister Davis Hughes with any
serious hope that it would get the
major hall at the Sydney Opera House
as an opera auditorium.
It now looks certain that Opera will
be relegated to the second hall, where
a smaller stage, smaller pit, and smaller
audience (1500 compared with 1800 in
the bigger hall’s “Opera configuration”)
will limit the operatic productions to
Glyndebourne scale and rule out the
more massive and seldom played
operas.
But the most surprising feature of
the Monday meeting, at which Mr.


Hughes met not only the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust but also other users like
the ABC (whose ambitions to get the
major hall as an ideal concert hall are
carrying the day) and the Opera House
Trust, was the proposal quite seriously
put up by Dr. Coombs that concerts
be thrown out of the big hall into the
little one, leaving the big one for opera
and ballet.
So, in the last-ditch stand, the Eliza-
bethan tried to turn the Opera House
into an opera house. But opera has
never been regarded as the major func-
tion of this misnamed group of halls
that visiting British adviser on the
project T. Ernest Bean calls a “cul-
tural supermarket enclosed by a magni-
ficent shell.” The main object of the
Opera House has always been to pro-
vide a concert hall first, and then
other things like opera, provided this
did not damage its excellence as a
concert hall. Any protests about this
are 10 years too late.
Both Utzon and the new architects
had found it impossible to design a
hall that would cater well for both
concerts and opera, at least for the
numbers that were demanded.
In these circumstances there is an
inevitability about the architectural
panel’s proposal that opera be moved
out of the major hall.
But the Elizabethan Theatre Trust’s
suggestion that concerts be thrown out
instead could not hope to stand any
chance of success. Dr. Coombs’ men
were proposing that 2000 operatic seats
be put into the big hall (which has
room for 2800 concert seats) and that
2800 concert seats be squeezed into the
smaller hall, representing almost a
doubling of the numbers the new archi-
tects are trying to fit in if the hall were
to be used for opera. The Elizabethan
also suggested that an ideal opera rever-
beration time of 1.3 seconds be designed
into the big hall and a concert rever-
beration time of two seconds be put
into the smaller hall.
But Mr. Utzon’s roof is not made of
elastic; there is simply not the space in
the small hall for 2800 concert-
goers—and the experts told Mr. Hughes
there was certainly not enough area in
it to allow for the reverberation time
of two seconds needed for concerts.
But not even the Elizabethan seemed
to take itself seriously with this pro-
posal, for in its submissions to Mr.
Hughes on Monday it also pressed for
the multi-purpose nature of the major
hall to be retained, even though the
concert reverberation time would not
suit opera, even though the seating
arrangements would not be ideal, and
even though finding the space to seat
2800 concert-goers involved cutting into
the stage area and lifting the proscenium
arch.
As Mr. Bean reported to Mr. Hughes
on Monday: “The Trust on balance
believes it to be so desirable to retain
the dual-purpose function of the major
hall that they are ready to accept an
imperfect acoustic and a less than per-
fect auditorium for the performance of
opera. Can this readiness to accept a
compromise in these important respects
be justified.” Bean suggests that an
unsatisfactory opera house would
adversely affect both the public’s enjoy-
ment of opera and the prestige of the
centre as a whole.
A decision to reject the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust’s ideas means, in effect,
a decision to seek perfection in a
limited number of functions (which
include, by the way, the most popular
function of subscription concerts)
instead of attaining a second-rate
quality by spreading the hall’s uses a
bit more. The Government had no
real choice; it had to try after perfec-
tion.

THE MASONS
By MICHAEL BAUME
Sinister? Harmless?
Declining? Expanding?
ITS power is largely an illusion; the
“secrets” of its ritual have been
printed in many books and shown
at tedious length on television; as a
charitable organisation, it is large but
relatively self-centred; as a political
pressure group, it is inconsequential
(discussion of political matters is
banned in lodge); its role in providing
preference in employment is small and
diminishing, and, as an organisation, it
has been running down, with a 14
percent drop in membership in the
past eight years in N.S.W. alone.
But in Australia, where one in every
ten adult males is a mason, free-
masonry is still a force (“for good,” say
its supporters) and will continue to be
one, with many influential men among
its' members. Its numbers are believed
to be picking up again a little as the
craft has been instituting reforms 'tQ
give itself a better “image” that would
add to its appeal among worthwhile
potential members.
But it faces real problems in giving
a 20th-century appearance to what
seems to be such an old-fashioned Vic-
torian sort of institution. Its main
buildings are mostly drably uncomfort-
able, their furnishings dull (unpadded
former “front stalls” cinema seats run
around most lodge rooms), its member-
ship is heavily weighted with old men,
its rituals in craft lodges are generally
repetitious, involving, with little excep-
tion, the initiating of new members or
their passing or raising to higher
degrees. To most masons, these cere-
monies, which are, in effect, allegorical
plays and the “South” or supper
after the lodge meeting represent
the total of their masonic experience.
To many of them, these are not enough
to make the craft appealing.
Yet to be a mason in a fuller sense
takes an immense, amount of time and
effort, particularly in learning large
slabs of ritual by rote in progressing
up the ladder of promotion as an
officer of the lodge toward a one-year
term as its master, in visiting other
lodges at their monthly meetings as
well as one’s own, and in moving out
into the other associated lodges in
which further degrees can be gained.
The falling membership of the craft
is probably due largely to increasing
other demands on the available time of
members and potential members, not
only as ambitious young men in a com-
petitive society find themselves increas-
ingly reluctant to give up the time
needed to progress in the craft, but also
because of the development of so many
other methods of filling leisure time.
So, the most dangerous enemy of
freemasonry is not its traditional one,
the Catholic Church; it is modern
society and the television set, and
the licensed club.
And the lack of evidence of material
advantages now being derived out of
membership of a masonic lodge appears
to have discouraged many men from
remaining in or joining the craft (“and
good riddance,” is the official view,
which rejects this materialistic attitude
to freemasonry).
But despite all this, the masons are
still feared and hated.
’PO many Catholics, freemasonry is a
secret society “plotting against the
Church and State”; to many Protes-
tants it is an “anti-Christ” organisation;
to many frustrated employees, it is an
offensive “club,” whose members get
unfair job preference; to some poli-
ticians, it is an evil group that wields
immense and disproportionate politi-
cal power; and to television viewers
who saw a recent program of its ritual,
it is an immense bore.
But all of these attitudes to free-
masonry in Australia membership
of the United Grand Lodge of Ancient,
Free, and Accepted Masons are
claimed to be quite wrong by members
of the craft. Masonry, they say, is
misunderstood; it is a worthwhile
organisation, performing good and
charitable works for the community
at large, leading its members to the
good life in advocating the fatherhood
of God and the brotherhood of man,
and that although opportunities do
exist for the craft to be misused by
its members, it is not aimed at bring-
ing any sort of material benefit to
them, although masons are required
to help each other in times of need.
Where masons are strictly required
to follow a particular code of con-
duct to other masons, it could possibly
be argued that this represents unfair
preference, but this is taking a long
bow in the sort of situation where a
mason swears: “I will not injure or
revile a master mason myself or know-
ingly suffer others to do so, if in my
power to prevent it, but on the con-
trary, will boldly repel the slanderer
of his good name and will ever most
strictly respect the chastity of those
nearest and dearest to him in the
persons of his wife, his sister, and his
daughter.”
In the past, masons have in some
ways enjoyed being “misunderstood”;
their organisation has been feared far
more than is warranted, and its
appearance of power could have played
some part in attracting many of the
300,000-odd members of the craft in
Australia.
But recently, with its membership
falling, the craft has been wondering
whether it should not change its
image and, anyway, the “secret”
words and grips that have helped
arouse so much fury and so many
jokes are no longer real secrets.
The craft now appears to be aiming
at being “understood” as its answer to
its dwindling numbers; it is even pre-
paring a booklet on freemasonry and
its obligations for the study of potential
members before they are required to
make the dreadful-sounding promises
that have aroused such hostility.
The decision to issue this booklet
followed the presentation a little over
a year ago of a report to the Grand
Master by a committee of inquiry he
had set up in 1964 to inquire into the
reasons for lessening of applications for
membership of the craft, “particularly
having regard to the population of the
State; as to whether a greater propor-
tion of brethren are ‘calling off’ and
why; if the percentage of attendance of
members at meetings of their respec-
tive lodges is gradually becoming less
and the reasons for this; to investigate
and report on any other matters that
the committee considers may be affect-
ing the craft adversely.”
There can be no doubt about declin-
ing numbers. In his last quarterly com-
munication as N.S.W. Grand Master
in June, 1966 (before being succeeded
by M.W. Bro. E. A. Primrose, who is
pictured on the cover at his installation
ceremony), M.W. Bro. E. L. Beers
spoke of things appearing to be “at a
low ebb” and urged that “we must
work hard to revitalise the craft.”
The 1965 initiation rate .was only
about one-third of that ruling in the
post-war years up to 1950, as 2639
men were initiated into freemasonry
and another 1695 existing masons
joined N.S.W. lodges, a total of 4334,
while 4964 “called off,” 1714 died, and
809 were struck off.
At the end of 1965 there were'
116,000 masons in N.S.W. in 912 active
lodges down 3150; in Victoria there
were 114,700 in 820 lodges down
2250; in Queensland about 37,000; in
South Australia about 27,000; in Tas-
mania about 900, and an unstated
number in W.A.
The Grand Master’s report in N.S.W.
says that there is a definite connection
between membership and wars and
that this may explain the current mem-
bership situation. In both world wars,/
initiations dropped slightly immedi-
ately after the declaration of war, to

rise rapidly during the latter part and
immediately after peace and reach a
peak 13 years after peace, and' then
decline.
But the craft is progressing with its
more “open” approach. Shortly before
his term of office ended last year, the
N.S.W. Grand Master told Grand Lodge
that “the Committee suggests, and I
agree, that good dignified publicity is
not contrary to our principles. Our
moral and high spiritual standards
should be made known.”
In any event, if freemasonry does
develop a more “open” image in its
bid to restore its size and stature, even
its most influential antagonist, the
Catholic Church, would find it hard
put to expect much serious popular
support or sympathy for the more
extreme of its allegations about the
masons. Can it be possible that those
mild-looking men standing on suburban
railway stations in their dinner suits
carrying small bags are really on their
way to secret gatherings to plot against
the Church and State? The Church
says so officially, and excommunicates
any of its number who joins the craft (a
penalty which does not apply to mem-
bership of such anti-Christian organisa-
tions as the Australian Communist
Party).
B UT its real (and strongly arguable)
reasons probably lie elsewhere;
much of the Catholic Information
Centre material on freemasonry is
absurd, being based on a misunderstand-
ing of modern British freemasonry. Evi-
dence of this absurdity about “plots” is
visible from the composition of the
craft, which is loaded with leaders of
both the Church (particularly the
Anglican church, including a former
Archbishop of Canterbury) and State.
The N.S.W. Premier, Mr. Askin, and
a number of his Ministers are masons,
and were among the 33 members of
N.S.W. Parliament (of whom very
few indeed would be from the Labor
Party) who attended a meeting of
Lodge Randwick High School last
March when the speaker of the N.S.W.
Legislative Assembly, Very Worshipful
Brother Kevin W. C. Ellis, PDGIW,
was present at his old school lodge
for the first time as a grand lodge
officer.
The Chief Justice of N.S.W., Sir
Leslie Herron, was master of his lodge,
The Royal Empire, last year. The
N.S.W. bench is represented in Grand
Lodge by His Honor Judge Mclntosh,
the Grand Registrar, and by His Honor
Mr. Justice Richardson, a Past Deputy
Grand Master. There has often been a
suggestion that it is an unofficial
“arrangement” that the position of
N.S.W. Commissioner of Police should
alternate between a mason and a
Catholic. The late Sir John Northcott,
former governor of N.S.W., was a Past
Grand Master in N.S.W. Sir Charles
Gairdner, the Governor of Tasmania
and formerly of Western Australia, is a
Most Worshipful Past Grand Master
(W.A.). And the former Governor of
Victoria, Sir Dallas Brooks, who died
in March, 1966, was a Most Worshipful
Past Grand Master.
There are strong suggestions that
masonic influences have played a part
in the Victorian Labor Party in-fighting.
Bob Holt, the former president, is said
to be a mason, and it is claimed that,
for a while, some masons supplied part
of the forces opposed to the Catholic
Right Wing without being leftist.
In Australian Federal politics, Labor’s,
deputy-leader, Mr. Gough Whitlam,
has pointed to the “harmful effects” of
the masonic influence on the Liberal
Party. He said: “It is very difficult for
a Catholic to receive an appointment
to a top Government job or a Govern-
ment commission or to get political
selection from the Liberal Party. I
think the lower levels of the Liberal
Party are strongly influenced by free-
masonry.”
Mr. Askin replied: “His statement
about outside influences in the Liberal
Party from any quarter is utter balder-
dash.” The N.S.W. Liberal Party sec-
retary, Mr. J. L. Carrick, said last
week: “I’ve seen no evidence of any
kind of extra-political associations
having any impact on Liberal Party
politics at all, although some important
men in the Party have held high
masonic office. Many seem to be
associated with their old school lodges,
but I wonder whether the major inter-
est there is masonic or the maintenance
of old school ties.”
In Britain, as James Dewar points
out in his recent book, “The Unlocked
Secret,” the craft has drawn to it
many men of power and influence in
business and the professions and the
favorable attention of the royal
family. The latest royal recruit, Dewar
notes, is the Duke of Kent. Dewar also
lists an imposing array of MPs, bishops


and archbishops (and a rabbi), FRCSs
and Ps, judges, generals, ambassadors,
scientists, and businessmen like Lord
Baillieu, Lord Rusholme, and Sir Noel
Bowater in Grand Lodge, but adds that
the academic and artistic worlds show
hardly any signs of representation. In
Australian academic circles there are
some masons; Lodge Sydney University
is a large and impressive one. There
are few representatives of the arts
but many sportsmen, like Bert Oldfield.
America has had 14 masonic Presi-
dents (L.B.J. set off to be a mason but
gave up), and two years ago, says
Dewar, a majority of the governors of
the 50 States and of members of the
Senate and of the Supreme Court of
the U.S. were masons.
But, impressive as is the list of mem-
bers of the craft, it is hard to establish
evidence of political decisions being
taken as a result of masonic pressure.
Despite the large number of Liberal
politicians in Australia in the craft, it
would be wrong to suggest that most
masons are “silvertails”; membership
is widely spread through the trades
and professions. This is in sharp con-
trast with Britain, where it is very
much an “establishment” organisation
and has heavy membership fees.
There are still some “masonic” com-
panies in N.S.W. where it is important
to be in the craft to get on - one large
and successful building materials com-
pany is heavily masonic—but in general
the pressures of getting the best man
for the job are becoming so great in
this competitive society that masonic
nepotism does not appear to be nearly
as pronounced as critics claim.
“It is only if all other things are
equal and I mean equal that a
mason might be preferred to a non-
mason in my employment, arid that
has little to do with any prejudice for
masons. The simple fact is that I know
a mason has sworn to behave by a
moral code, and adherence to it would
make him a better employee to me
than someone whose attitudes I am not
certain about,” a Sydney businessman
told me. To this extent, being a mem-
ber of a Lions Club or a former Boy
Scout would be just as important.
“Salesmen and representatives who
come into my office full of signs and
handshakes get no recognition from me
—and certainly no business,” the master
of one of Sydney’s “old boy” lodges told
me last week. “It is quite wrong for
masons to expect that membership of
the craft can be used like this; the rules
are strictly opposed to it.”
All but a very few masons reserve
the use of signs exclusively for the
lodge room; few Australian masons go
around making gestures, although it is
customary for pieces of the ritual to
crop up in conversation, and masons
probably identify each other more often
this way than any other, especially as
the ritual is so cliche-ridden that much
of it fits into normal conversation.
What goes on inside the lodge rooms
that are so closely guarded? It is no
secret any more; not only have there
been books written about it (James
Dewar’s “The Unlocked Secret” is
the latest and best description), and
television features done on it, but even
some children’s programs (like a
recent instalment of Robin Hood) are
full of masonic ritual.
No mason would be breaking his
oath to “Hele, conceal, and never
reveal” the secrets of the craft (on
pain of some quite horrible, but for-
tunately symbolic, penalties) by saying
that most meetings were concerned
with initiating a candidate to the craft,
or passing him to a fellow-craft status
of raising him through the third
degree to be a master mason. And when
there are no candidates for one of
these ceremonies, the lodge will either
hear a lecture on a masonic subject
or have a “practice run” at a first,
second, or third degree ceremony by
using one of its members.
After the ritual, members adjourn
to a supper to have (unless they are a
temperance lodge) a “good time,” with
a few beers, some entertainment, a
speech or two, and a bit of a chat.
One of freemasonry’s major func-
tions is as a charity. But Dewar says:
“If masonry is regarded purely as a
charitable club, its organisation is fan-
tastically wasteful; if it is simply a
society of men interested in the preser-
vation and performance of rituals, its
membership is remarkably large. No
doubt charity and ritual are important
aspects of modern freemasonry, but
they do not seem sufficient to com-
prise the whole purposes of a move-
ment attracting a variety of men in
such large numbers.”
In Australia, it is a very big business.
In N.S.W. alone, which has 116,000 out
of Australia’s 300,000 masons, the
One in every 10 adult males
United Grand Lodge’s invested funds
totalled $1.96 million, quite apart from
other special resources like the $l.B
million Masonic Temples Fund, two-
thirds of which is to go toward build-
ing a new headquarters and the rest to
suburban and country temples.
(The temples fund had only been
going six years at balance date for
1965-66, and the total of $1.2 million
available for the building of a suitable
temple and offices in Sydney is still far
from what is considered necessary,
although officials hope to have enough
to commence building on the land
already owned by 1972 or 1973, and
as a result most of the investments in
fixed interest securities in this fund
are aimed to fall due around that
time.)
And then there are organisations like
the N.S.W. Freemasons’ Orphan
Society, with funds available of
$114,465 (after spending $4OOO in sup-
port of children last year); the Free-
masons’ Benevolent Institution of
N.S.W. with assets of $580,000 (after
spending $55,667 of its own income of
$lOO,OOO on “relief” and after its “sub-
sidiary,” The Hunter Valley Masonic
Hospital, earned $7OOO more than the
$53,000 it spent); The N.S.W. Masonic
Youth Welfare Fund, with assets of
$328,000; the Frank Whiddon Masonic
Homes with assets at book value of
$840,000 after last year’s income of
$357,000 exceeded expenditure by
$142,000.
So masons in N.S.W. together own
assets totalling close to $6 million—
apart from the specific assets that each
lodge (or small group of lodges) own,
such as suburban or country temples,
the value of which would total many
hundreds of thousands of dollars. And
the same goes for Victoria, where the
membership is only a fraction lower
than in N.S.W.
The bulk of the craft’s N.S.W. invest-
ment is in Commonwealth bonds; half
the UGL’s assets of $1.96 million are
in bonds, the rest being mainly in
properties in Castlereagh Street (book
value $130,000), Goulburn Street (book
value $150,000 on which tenants —some
of whom are unsatisfactory—pay rents
of $24,000 to bring in a net $1327),
and the masonic school and hospital;
in semi-government loans (largely the
Sydney Water Board, which has had
strong masonic associations and in
which $132,000 was invested), fixed
deposits with banks (mainly the Com-
mercial Banking Co. of Sydney with
$110,000) and cash at bank (with the
CBC having about $91,000 in general
account).
The FBI is a little more adventur-
ous with its investments than Grand
Lodge. It has about $380,000 invested
in debenture stock, mainly with the
leading bank-associated hire-purchase
companies (with the notable exception
of Custom Credit and with special
emphasis on Mutual Acceptance and
Alliance Holdings).
Most of the payments from the
“Fund of Benevolence” administered
by Grand Lodge go to masonic chari-
ties or relief, but it also pays out con-
siderable sums to other charitable in-
stitutions, for example, last year $4OOO
was split among 43 public hospitals
and other bodies like the Salvation
Army (despite the Army’s strong ob-
jection to its members being
the Mission to Seamen, the Sydney
City Mission, and the ambulance ser-
vice.
And this excludes the considerable
amounts given to charities of one kind
or another by each individual lodge,
although the amounts given to masonic
charities appear in the
columns of these charities.
Most of the Board of Benevolence
grants are of between $l5O to $250 to
widows of masons, but there are many
instances of needy masons themselves
being helped by gifts of $2OO or $300;
and some funerals are paid for.

LETTERS
Hanging Murderers
Sir,
In the highly emotional and inac-
curate article on “Killing Ronald
Ryan” (8., Jan. 7), Peter Samuel de-
monstrated the old statistician’s trick of
drawing an accurate line from an un-
warranted assumption to a foregone
conclusion.
His picture of the prisoner,
“struggling and filthy with fear,” does
not accord with fact. These days, the
prisoner is given heavy sedation the
night before. With the hangman’s
knot, loss of consciousness is instan-
taneous, due to fracture of cervical
vertebrae and rupture of the spinal
cord.
Mr. Samuel’s claim that murders
are generally committed, without
thought, by temporarily crazed people
does not hold water. After a bank
robbery in Victoria, Ronald Ryan used
his “getaway” car to knock a young
man, who followed him on a motor-
bike, off his machine. Ryan ran back
and was about to shoot the unconscious
youth through the head when he was
forcefully restrained by his own com-
panion, who feared the death sentence
for murder.
Surely the main purpose of the law
is to protect the life and property of
decent citizens. So long as there is the
slightest chance that the death penalty
will save the life of one decent citizen,
it is worth hanging fifty incorrigibly
vicious, inhuman monsters.
J. H. G. DYSON-FIRTH
Fairy Meadow (N.S.W.)
Sir,
I greatly enjoyed M. H. Ellis’ article
(8., Dec. 31) on Ned Kelly, and I
am sure that the views expressed are
shared by most sane Australians. Yet
in the very next issue of THE
BULLETIN I found to my amazement
what appeared to be an editorial article
which demanded that an equally ras-
cally blackguard, one Ronald Ryan,
should be spared the punishment meted
out to Kelly.
Some may claim that times have
changed. But is not the life of Ryan’s
victim as sacred as those of Kelly’s
victims? Is not society today as much
in need of being rid of its scum as
it was 97 years ago? Is not the crime
of murder as heinous now as it was
then? Or are we so sick, so maudlin, so
sentimental that we will overlook the
crime, have no sympathy for the victim,
but pour our loving kindness on the
animals who stalk in our midst and
prey on us?
M. KARTZOFF
Roseville Chase (N.S.W.)
Sir,
I had a good deal to do with a
maximum security prison in another
country and found that improving
“criminal features” by plastic surgery
made no difference to the habit of re-
peating crimes; that psychological help
often ended up with the psychologist
being beaten with a handy chair; that
psychiatric treatments helped only some
of the younger offenders. I found that
a hard core of unfortunates had all
these pompous efforts made to help
them and the community from whom
they had to be segregated, but remained
repeaters.
Once an individual becomes a hope-
less “repeater,” then, in my opinion,
is the time to consider whether that
criminal should be barred for ever
from his community by being disposed
of humanely (certainly not by any pre-
sent judicial methods), or by life in-
carceration.
Perhaps a computer fed with present
thoughts of many committees giving
earnest attention to the criminal, ten
percent of us would come up with a
set of rules on these emotional and
controversial issues!
DR. R. J. WILSON

“Doves " Into “Hawks "
Sir,
Monty Dennison’s remarks (8., Jan.
7) on the William White case were
commendable enough. However, two
things bug me about conscientious ob-
jectors. Firstly, how are we going to
prevent poseurs from getting out of
military service? Secondly, what if fel-
lows like William White change their
principles after a few years? If such
doves become (still able-bodied) hawks,
shouldn’t they be obliged to do their
duty?
I hope this does not embarrass your
ardent conscriptionist Brian Buckley,
who earned notability some years ago
for refusing to do National Service be-
cause he was a Christian (Catholic)
pacjfist. I would welcome one of his
“sophisticated” (I think that is his
operative word) probes into conscien-
tious objection, because many reactions
to this subject seem to me quite adven-
titious.
JAMES GRIFFIN

For “Miss Australia "
Sir,
I suggest that Mr. Sam Dailey in his
comments on the Miss Australia contest
(8., Dec. 31) is sadly off the mark.
Physical need and physical beauty are
not incompatible, but rather part of a
unified and larger whole. During the
past two years the Printing and Allied
Industries in Victoria raised a total of
$42,000 for the Spastics and our
nominee in each year became “Miss
Australia Charity Queen.” Does Mr.
Dailey seriously suggest that we should
be ashamed of this effort? Would that
amount of money have been raised if
we were publicising “the work of the
Spastic Centre”? The end is inspira-
tional. The means are good and honest.
Sam Dailey: please do not deny us
the right to help.

Adult Education
Sir,
Mr. Derek contributions
(8., Dec. 17) to what is essentially a
discussion on academic policy have
been marked by an air of lofty con-
descension; they have indulged in quite
unfounded imputation of motives, they
have been largely irrelevant and have
failed to come to grips with the issue.
And their style is clearly designed to
show what a clever fellow Mr. White-
lock is. But at long last Mr. Whitelock
has come to the point. To justify uni-
versity participation in adult educa-
tion, he says universities do it, so, of
course, they should go on doing it, and
it is impertinent of me (or for the
Universities Commission?) to ask ques-
tions.
C. R. BADGER
Director, Council of Adult
Education
Melbourne (Vic.)
Sir,
Some are questioning the benefits
of Adult Education, and more parti-
cularly, the “Kits” scheme, as supplied
by the University of Sydney. As a
member of a successful Artists’ Kit
scheme, I would like to point out a
few of its benefits. A housewife has no
graduate’s diploma, yet she has to be
all things to her husband and children.
In the city, one can enrol at a techni-
cal college or university, and do an
evening course. However, women living
in a country town without any facilities
for higher education need the corres-
pondence forms of education in learn-
ing and sharing together a Kit group
provides. Are we expected to become
“vegetables” for the price of living in
the wide open spaces? The Australian
Universities Commission must consider
the facts carefully, as the repercussions
of any decision will surely be great on
country folk.

No Sense Of Humor

Your television critic (8., Dec. 31)

since Steele Rudd defined the “Dad

that while on the one hand Mr. Larter
calls upon his fellows to follow his
resolution to abstain from art, on the
other he sees the New Year in by
exhibiting three of his paintings at

Mary Gilmore Letters
Sir,
With the approval of the literary
executors of Dame Mary Gilmore, I am
preparing a selection of her letters for
publication, containing as wide an ex-
pression as possible of her varied in-
terests.
Could I request that any of your
readers who hold letters from Dame
Mary kindly forward the letters or
copies to me, Professor T. Inglis Moore,
Department of English, A.N.U., Box
4, P. 0., Canberra, A.C.T'. Originals
will be returned by registered mail.
Any information welcomed as to the
whereabouts of letters written by Dame
Mary.

THE CLONTARF ORGY
86 Years Ago: January 15, 1881.
TVHE straight hitting of THE
BULLETIN in its last article on
“The Clontarf Orgy” has been felt
in the right quarter. We have been
threatened with all kinds of proceed-
ings by the parties to whom the lash
was applied; but, nothing daunted,
we will revert to the subject again
and force the legislature to provide a
remedy. Here are extracts from a
few of the letters we have received:
“A Parramatta JP” writes as fol-
lows: “Bravo, BULLETIN, your
leader of Saturday last, ‘The Larri-
kin Residuum,’ was an excellent and
forcible one. Continue in your good
work until our local magistracy,
clergy, and politicians do their work
in crushing this crying evil.”
“A Parent” writes: “You have done
right good service in your article last
Saturday on larrikinism—the only
real evil that faces us in this country.
What I say now is the truth and I
regret it much: The youth of this
colony, at least of all the cities and
large towns, are growing up without
religion, without principle, and with-
out respect for themselves or those
above them.”
A “City Member” says: “Your
article in the last issue was in true
BULLETIN form. It has thoroughly
roused public attention to the larrikin
danger.”
A “C.E. clergyman” writes:
“Your able leader should be read by
every parent in the city. With Dean
Cowper I have been preaching
against larrikinism for years.”


Face of the World
Asia: The week ended without
clarification of China’s internal
revolts, but some major cities were
in turmoil. A central figure, Prime
Minister Chou En-lai, was trying to
prevent civil war. Japan’s election
campaigns began with an apology by
Premier Sato for scandals past. In
Vietnam, 25,000 U.S. troops began
a mass advance in the “iron tri-
angle” staging area north of Saigon
while the enemy shelled four ships
in the Saigon River. The last British
troops left Borneo, where floods
made 70,000 homeless. In Indonesia,
President Sukarno continued to defy
Army, Congress, and student “please
explains.”
The Americas: The U.S. 90th
Congress convened and heard Presi-
dent Johnson’s appeal for a tax rise
to pay for the Vietnam war. Separ-
ately, Mr. Cabot Lodge predicted
sensational results for U.S. forces in
Vietnam this year. Negro Congress-
man Adam Clayton Powell was
removed by Congress as one of its
House Committee chairmen. The
U.S. launched a second Pacific com-
munications satellite, Intelsat 2, and
signed an investment guarantee
agreement with Indonesia to prevent
future expropriation. In the
United Nations, Secretary-General U
Thant challenged the “dominoes
theory” and the view that Vietnam
was vital to Western security.
Europe: The U.S.S.R. sent the
11 members of the Politburo out to
warn Russians of China’s anti-Soviet
policies, while the Lrench Com-
munist Party denounced Peking.
Europe’s annual winter freeze had
arrived, but in Italy a group of
Catholic and Anglican theologians
went into retreat in an attempt to
unfreeze some of the Churches’ dif-
ferences. On the southern fringe of
Europe, Israeli and Syrian skir-
mishes continued, and Egyptian air-
craft dropped napalm and gas on
Yemeni villages. Princess Margreit
of Holland married a commoner.
British Prime Minister Wilson re-
shuffled his Cabinet in a further
move towards Common Market
entry.
Africa: Rhodesia’s lan Smith
addressed 26 tribal chiefs represent-
ing four million Rhodesian Africans,
and issued a statement that all sup-
ported his stand against Britain. In
Congo, President Mobutu national-
ised the Belgian-owned mining com-
pany Union Miniere. Chief Jona-
than, of Lesotho, visited surrounding
South Africa to assure Prime Minis-
ter Vorster of his friendship.
Africa’s first coup for 1967 occurred
in Togo where the Army deposed
the President without bloodshed.
OVERSEAS
Week of Blood Red Thought
The battles of Shanghai, Nanking, and Canton have not yet shifted the balance
of power in China. They may not have been major battles at all. But to two old
guerrilla generals like Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao they should have signalled
something about the course of the conflict they have let loose.
Mao and Lin must have known it
would be a long, tough job to shove
their cultural revolution into every
nook and cranny of China. But the
past two weeks of industrial strikes,
sabotage, dislocated production, and
peasant and worker uprisings against a
movement that calls itself proletarian
should have suggested the unthink-
able. This may be a revolution that
even Maoists cannot win, and which
could turn the East blood red.
Mao Tse-tung and Lin seem to have
provoked the outbursts by a decision to
have a showdown with their enemies.
In Peking they stepped up the drive
against Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-
ping by holding almost daily Red
Guard rallies and by sticking up posters
in which China’s head of State and
chief apparatchik were criticised by the
Liu children and, according to one
report, by Mao himself. On Thurs-
day they ordered a shake-up of
the committee that was supposed to be
keeping the Army in line, with Mrs.
Mao to “advise” on the shake-up. And
in the provinces they set off a new stage
of the campaign against dissident Party
leaders by sending Red Guard
organisers into factories and farms.
On Monday, 32 Red Guard organisa-
tions in Shanghai claimed that the
Shanghai Party Committee, which was
leading the rebel workers, had been
“knocked down.” Yet later in the
week it seemed that the familiar
“handful” of Party leaders in Shanghai
and other cities was still “playing new
tricks.” On Wednesday Mao issued a
message in the name of all the authori-
ties in Peking calling upon the whole
nation—Party, Government and Army,
revolutionary students, peasants and
workers—to learn from the experience
of the Red Guards in Shanghai. What
the Maoists should have learned from
Shanghai is that Party and workers
make a formidable alliance. But
Mao seems set on making his
revolutionary writ run across the
country. What this will mean in prac-
tical terms is siege warfare against the
leading Party secretaries in most of
China’s provinces and cities which have
committed themselves against the Mao-
Lin line by defying previous Red Guard
attacks. If the assault on them is
attempted by Guards alone, it will be a
fierce enough struggle, judging by last
week’s resistance by workers in the
industrial cities. But if Wednesday’s
appeal to the Army is more than ritual,
and Mao attempts to call-up the pro-
vincial divisions, he could lead China
into a full-scale civil war. In much of
China, where the local party leader-
ship is solidly entrenched in power, the
local party boss is also political com-
missar of the local Army battalions.
Mao and Lin might succeed in con-
solidating their power, region by region,
by using loyal Army battalions from
around Peking. But even among the
officers at the centre there have been
signs of disaffection: the latest came
this week with the denunciation of Liu
Chih-chien, a deputy political director
of the Army, and the reorganisation of
the Army’s Cultural Revolution group.
So Mao and Lin, as two good guer-
illas, should be preparing a fail-back
position. Mao may already have been
thinking along these lines: earlier this
week posters quoted him as pleading
for compromise and even urging an
end to the attacks on the leaders of the
opposition, Liu and Teng. Yet the
campaign against these two former
comrades has probably gone too far for
the steamroller to stop.
One important concession that might
help to damp down some of the recent
turbulence would be to drop the idea
Mrs. Mao
of pushing Red Guards and the Cul-
tural Revolution into industry and
agriculture. The Prime Minister,
Chou En-lai, and his cabal of economic
realists were bound to oppose this
recent move. There was a suggestion
of triumph in Chou’s appearance
at a Peking rally on Sunday,
the day after the first set of
posters attacking him had been torn
down. With Mao’s wife, lending him
authority, he called for a continuation
of the struggle against the Liu-Teng
revisionist line, but warned his audience
that another group of men should be
left alone. This group, not surprisingly,
included five Deputy Prime Ministers


and three of Chou’s most important co-
believers.
If Mao and Lin are to keep their
diminishing list of supporters without
risking civil war, they may have to rein
in Mrs. Mao, who is looking more and
more like the evil genius of the past
few weeks and perhaps of the whole
Red Guard campaign. Another part
of a possible compromise might be to
get rid of Mrs. Mao’s equally blood-
thirsty partner Chen Po-ta, the Direc-
tor of the Cultural Revolution. And
Mao may even have to consider dump-
ing Lin Piao. '
But even if Mao should turn out to
be willing to emasculate his revolution
—and the Wednesday appeal suggests
that he is not —he will still have to deal
with infuriated Party leaders in the
provinces. Mao might decide that the
sanest course for the time being is
to let dogs’ heads lie. In this case it
would be the 1930 s all over again,
with Mao reigning in the capital, as
Chiang Kai-shek did then, while a
good part of the country was ruled by
rival politicians and local military men
virtually independent of Peking. That
would be a stinging defeat for China’s
second great unifier. Mao has never
been an advocate of peaceful
existence. But unless he can be sure
of the entire Army-—and he probably
cannot be—he may have no choice.
A concession to regionalism would
mean abandoning some of the most
important benefits like the fair
distribution of food that the
Communists have brought to China
since 1949. They have not made any
miracles with their harvests; but their
efficient centralised administration has
wiped out the chronic famines India
still fears. Even this achievement would
be in danger if the conflict continued
for long.
It is not a happy prospect for the
Chinese people. Whatever else may be
said of Mao’s rule, they have profited
from 17 years of peace ,and political
stability. The loss of that stability,
and a possible degeneration into war-
lordism or civil war, would be worse
for them than some kind of com-
promise settlement between Mao and
his opponents.
A continuation of civil conflict in
China probably means a temporary
Chinese withdrawal from the world.
The calling in of Chinese dip-
lomats this week may be the begin-
ning of such a retreat behind the Great
Wall. The bureaucrats will doubt-
less try to keep the supplies
flowing to Vietnam, but if the break-
down of administration gets bad
enough, even this will be in doubt.
The North Vietnamese may be both
relieved at a release from Chinese pres-
sure and worried about possible Ameri-
can reactions, perhaps in the form of
stepped-up raids on the North. If
this worry, combined with an increase
of Russian influence, were to push the
North Vietnamese one step nearer the
conference table, this would be the
best by-product the world can hope
for from Mao’s Cultural Revolution.
Singapore’s Goh
From ALEX JOSEY in Singapore
DR. GOH KENG SWEE is not an
easy man to understand. He pro-
fesses a contempt for detailed
economic planning. Yet his inter-
nationally acclaimed $4O million
economic development board is with-
out equal in any newly developing
country. He is a chess player, rank-
ing among the State’s best, yet he
made moves when Minister for Finance,
in the textile quota war with Britain,
for example, which appeared more like
Dulles “brinkmanship” than Capa-
blanca calculation. His decision to tax
transport bringing workers to the in-
dustrial site at Jurong, an attempt to
force workers out of city slums into
modern low-priced flats he had built
specially for them on the site, was
another instance, of which there are
many, of Dr. Goh’s aptitude for un-
expected, and sometimes unpopular,
decisions.
Dr. Goh, in his middle forties, mar-
ried (his wife works in social welfare),
with a son at the
university, prefers a
nation of rugged
individualists to a
nation of bureau-
crats, yet he be-
came a politician
after a highly suc-
cessful career as a
top civil servant.
He has been ac-
cused of being con-
temptuous of or-
ganised labor, yet
Dr. Goh Keng Swee, Singapore’s
Minister of Defence, arrives in
Australia next week to read a paper
at the Australian Institute of
Political Science Summer School
on “Communism in Asia. A Threat
to Australia?”
no man has done more to raise the
status of Singapore’s trade union move-
ment, or worked harder to ensure
social justice for the worker. He
founded the Workers’ Research Unit.
He produced the Production Code,
which guided employers as well as
employees.
Yet his socialism would encourage
capitalists, not eliminate them. “Let
the capitalists make capital. That is
what developing States want. Let them
make profits. Let the State see to it
that capitalists do not rob the workers,
or ill-treat them. Let us also ensure
that the workers permit the capitalists
to make profits. Then the State can
tax capitalists to pay for national
development and for the State’s social
welfare needs.”
Dr. Goh studied in England, at the
London School of Economics. In a
Cabinet largely of atheists, agnostics,
and Buddhists, Dr. Goh is one of two
Christians, but none of his colleagues
can match his knowledge of Chinese
history, especially military. He speaks
Chinese. He has never been to China.
He has made brief visits to the United
States and to New Zealand, and he
knows Europe fairly well. He has been
to Japan several times, and greatly
admires Japanese thrift, scientific skill,
and massive industrial output.
Young Private Goh fought against
the Japanese during the war. His life
was saved by a cabaret girl, a Japanese
Army collaborator. When the British
capitulated, the Singapore youth in the
Army, including Private Goh, threw
aside their uniforms and returned home.
Rounded up in batches, they were,
paraded before informers hidden be-
hind screens. Most of the youths in
Goh’s batch were condemned by the
cabaret girl peering through a hole in
the screen. They were ordered into a
lorry and were driven away, never to
be seen again. Why the girl, who
was unknown to him, spared his life,
Private Goh never knew. His good
fortune, the manner of his chancy
escape, possibly helped Dr. Goh develop
into the type of philosopher he has
become: with a pronounced attitude of
“live and let live,” and a ready smile as
much in the eyes as in the lips. “Oh,
I don’t know,” pro-
testingly, is possibly
his most common
exclamation.
Dr Goh has been
described as a
serious man with a
boyish sense of
humor. He has,
fbr example, the
disconcerting habit,
often when least ex-
pected, while walk-
ing pensively may-
be toward the seventh hole, or perhaps
when about to declare open yet another
new factory, of suddenly chuckling
at a flash of * humor apparent to no
one but himself. Some people say
that this tendency to be alone with
his thoughts, even in company, and his
habit of jerking out “What? What?”
as though suddenly emerging from
intense concentration, has become part
of the absentminded professor image
they say Dr. Goh cultivates; but this is
nonsense.
His chess mind thrives on harass-
ment, and if his tie is inside out or even
mislaid, this, after all, is not of great
importance. Any reasonable person
would agree there are more urgent
matters to think about. Dr. Goh is not
a poseur. On the contrary. He is an
extremely modest man, an eminently
sensible man devoid entirely of any
pretence or swank. At his clubs he
would indignantly reject any preferen-
tial treatment. He has no privileged
parking place. There are no outriding
motor-cycles to guide him through
traffic. At the hawker’s foodstall, in
the street, he waits his turn to be
served, and takes the next vacant stool.
Dr. Goh has no “big ideas” about him-
self.

to his intellectual courage and percep-
tion. Dr. Goh’s bold decision in 1961
to invest millions of money from the
State’s Treasury in a plan to transform
15,000 acres of wild and swampy
jungle into an industrial town of half a
million people, complete with its own
facilities, including deep-water harbor
and railway line, power, water, tele-
communications, and housing, is now
recognised to have been audacious and
essential. But there were many mis-
givings at the start, and even Dr. Goh
will now admit that Jurong could easily
have become a disaster not unlike John
Strachey’s ill-fated ground-nut scheme.
Instead, Jurong is an established success:
it is a bustling industrial satellite town
with factories, a steel mill, and a ship-
building yard, employing, when in full
production, 18,000 workers contribut-
ing some $l6O million a year to Singa-
pore’s wealth.
Dr. Goh saw in 1961, even earlier,
that modern Singapore must not con-
tinue to depend
upon her position
as one of the
world’s leading en-
trepots. Trade and
commerce, he be-
lieved, could not
alone provide work
for Singapore’s
speedily increasing
population. He had
little difficulty in
persuading his col-
leagues in the Gov-
ernment of the
necessity for Singa-
pore to industrialise.
He found plenty of
opposition outside,
from Singapore
traders and foreign
business houses. He
pressed ahead and
gradually brought
some of the rich
merchants round to
accepting his argu-
ments that their
future was in long-term investment, in
factories, steel mills, shipyards.
It was hard work, even for a man of
Dr. Goh’s ability. His zest for work is
remarkable. He is usually up before
daybreak, and often takes exercise on
the golf course before sitting down at
his desk about nine o’clock. He is a
man in a hurry. He showers and changes
in less than ten minutes. Unimportant
papers he can shovel away “by the
ton” in quick time. But hand him a
file which needs serious attention and
Dr. Goh will concentrate as only a
chess player can. For six years Dr.
Goh labored at his desk, nursing Jurong,
organising the community centres and
the vast People’s Association. And
then, on the instructions of his doctors,
he went to Germany with his wife for
medical care and complete relaxation.
It was typical of him that once the
decision had been taken he was ready
to go in a quarter of an hour.
When, on August 9, 1965, Singapore
Dr. Goh Keng Swee
was evicted from Malaysia, Dr. Goh
left the Ministry of Finance and be-
came Minister for Defence. He left
behind a record of incorruptibility un-
equalled in Asia.
Dr. Goh has always believed that for
a newly developing State to make pro-
gress, two factors are vital. One is
good civil service, the other: to com-
pete with Communist Party leisure-
organisers (all the more dangerous
when Communist Party activities in the
trade union movement have been re-
stricted, if not entirely eliminated),
good community leaders, trained to im-
part a civic responsibility to the
citizenry, and capable of out-organising
any Communist, no matter how en-
thusiastic.
This leadership development course,
expensive and highly organised, was
most comprehensive and is likely to
prove of considerable help to Dr. Goh
and his new capacity as Minister-in-
Charge of Singa-
pore’s Defence. Dr.
Goh was entrusted
by the Prime Mini-
ster with the task
of raising a brigade.
Mr. Lee could not
have made a better
choice. The interest
Dr. Goh had in
military matters
some 25 years ago
never completely
evaporated; his own
experience was lim-
ited, but Dr. Goh’s
book interest in
generals is by no
means confined to
Chinese generals of
the ancient past. He
brings to this new
job of building
Singapore’s Army
the same enthus-
iasm, the same
sense of urgency,
and the same care-
ful attention to detail which he con-
centrated upon the building of the
new industrial town of Jurong. He is
an honorary colonel in the People’s
Defence Force.
As Minister for Defence Dr. Goh
will have to make and maintain con-
stant contact with Malaysian and
British defence authorities. He gets
on well with the Tunku. Lee Kuan Yew,
as Prime Minister, took most of the
hatred of the “ultras” in Kuala Lum-
pur: Dr. Goh, more administrator than
politician to most people, was spared
much of this. Indeed, the extremists
said openly they would work with the
Singapore Government if the People’s
Action Party rid themselves of Lee and
made Goh Keng Swee Prime Minister.
“Are they mad?” muttered Dr. Goh.


ONE MORE
WEEK
Timing
ANY IDEA that Prime Minister Holt
might be taking note of Arthur Cal-
well’s campaign and as a consequence
be trying to “sneak” the South Viet-
namese Premier, Air Vice-Marshal Ky,
in and out of this country is dispelled
by the itinerary. Marshal Ky will be
in Sydney on Saturday and in Mel-
bourne on Sunday. Demonstrators
won’t even have to lose time from
work.
Grouse Is Extra
FOR THE ATTENTION of the Wine
and Food societies:
“Many people claim that there is no
real Australian cuisine, but ask an Aus-
tralian and he will probably say, ‘Well,
the Abos like eating witchity (sic)
grubs and we eat mutton, steak and
mash with Rosella tomato sauce. Mind
you, sport, there’s carpetbag steak,
rabbit stews, and kangaroo-tail soup.
Mum makes lamington and Pavlova
cake, and, my word, they’re grand
extra grouse! We put down a lot of
beer, too, and claret.’ ”
From a recent issue of the London
“Queen” magazine.
After the Battle
THE BATTLE for the Main Hall of
the Sydney Opera House (discussions
are going on this week) was over before
it began. If it looked for a moment
as if the ABC and the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust were locked in mortal
combat, this was merely a trick of
lighting. Opera made a very poor
showing. Even to those committed to
concerts, it must be alarming to realise
how few first-class people, or even
people of long, solid experience, we
have in any artistic field, apart from
the entrenched Concert Department of
the ABC.
But when the heat of battle over
the Main Hall dies away it is clear, if
Peter Hall’s basic plan is adhered to,
that drama may come out of it very
well. In Utzon’s scheme there was
merely one theatre, dubbed “experi-
mental,” apart from any occasional
use by larger companies of the Major
or Minor Halls. The “experimental”
theatre seated 350 and had distressingly
inadequate backstage facilities.
However, out of the space left over
when the expensive stage machinery for
the Major Hall is removed, Mr. Hall
has carved a theatre to seat at least 700
people and possibly 900. An area,
formerly designated a rehearsal room,
is to be given backstage facilities and
seating for 300, so that it might become
in some true sense an “experimental”
theatre or workshop.
Now drama and akin activities may
be able to range through major presen-
tations in the Minor Hall to a fair-
sized theatre, both from the audience
and—if rentals are not astronomic —
from the box-office point of view, and
a workshop.
Out of Tune
THE ABC may be winning the battle
for the main hall of the Sydney Opera
House, but in Perth it is facing the
choice between the Winthrop Hall, at
the University (and so out of the centre
of the city) and, additionally, an acous-
tic echo-chamber, and going under
canvas.
It’s a fairly long and sad story.
Perth has two main theatres. The 2000-
seat Capitol, in William Street, is close
to a car park but has always played
second fiddle to the smaller, more
central, older but better equipped
His Majesty’s.
The Capitol showed avant-garde
films and bare-breasted dancers, while
His Maj. played safe musicals that
courageously crossed the Nullarbor and
endless variations on the Russian enter-
tainers’ theme. But the Capitol was also
the only place in Perth where the
ABC could hold its subscription con-
certs, the only hall acoustically and
atmospherically fit for visiting celebri-
ties.
Then last year the Capitol was sold
to Tom Wardle “Tom the Cheap
Grocer” for $lBO,OOO. Last month
Wardle sold out at a profit of $20,000
to an unnamed business syndicate which
immediately announced it would build
a six-storey office block on the site.
T he ABC began negotiating with the
University to use Winthrop Hall on a
long-term basis. It will use it for some
performances during the Perth Festival,
beginning at the end of this month;
otherwise, during the Festival, it is
relying mainly on Perth’s perfect
Mediterranean climate and having free
concerts out of doors.
But among Perth’s agitated music-
lovers, fading memories of Perth City
Council’s scheme for, a concert hall
were revived. The Council called for
plans five years ago and gave the
winning architects $lO,OOO. The gesture
made, the Council shelved the plan
somewhere in its ultra-modern office
block.
After this pigeonholing, a citizens’
committee prepared concise plans for
the development of Heirisson Island, in
the Swan Riven The island, linked to
either side of the river by the Causeway
bridge, has room for cars and a culture
centre. But authority in Western Aus-
tralia doesn’t like individuals seizing
opportunities and the plans were
crushed on the drawing-board.
The State Government went as far
as to bring up the subject of its plans
for a $2l-million cultural centre north
of the railway line in Perth. But there
is no starting date for the 20-year
project.
The Perth Shire Council, as opposed
to the City Council, then asked the
Government for money so that it could
build a concert hall and win glory for
itself, but the Premier, David Brand,
who, ironically, is also Minister for
Tourism, turned the Shire Council
down.
There is still a good deal of public
agitation, but, all in all, it might be
safer to go under canvas. Otherwise
Perth might get an Opera House.

ney suburbia, a very young potter,

including three first prizes in the
Waratah Festival this year, one of
which was for sculpture. Fie has just
(ompleted a two-year course in pot-
tery at the National Art School which
he combined with a sculpture course
at night. He has been a member of
the rather exclusive Potters’ Society
for a year and is still their youngest
member.
His interest in pottery began at
Sydney Grammar School, where he
used to stay back for two hours every
afternoon working with clay. “But
all I really learnt was that clay had
to be fired and could be decorated.”
The decision to become a professional
potter seems rather extraordinary in
a 17-year-old boy, since the majority
of potters appear to turn to it from
other art forms. If Skillitzi succeeds
he is likely to be the first indigenous
Australian potter to leave school, be-
gin potting, and make a business of it.
He is quite convinced that he can
do this. He has a quiet purposeful-
ness:- “I am aware of my direction,
though I find myself wanting to experi-
ment with form, and the only way is
to produce in diverse ways, though there
is a strong linkage and the style is
individualistic.” He also believes that
traditional forms should be contorted
and distorted, almost destroyed and
then re-created to produce vitality.
J'HIS is obvious in his work- from the
tiny cups and bowls to tall sculp-
tured forms. He uses melted glass and
likes to base most of his pots on the
human figure. “They can be so much
more vigorous, with liveliness and often
humor. So much better than an
abstract form which resembles nothing.
I like directness in my work. And I
don’t think a pot should have to be
designed for some specific job. They
should be complete within themselves.”
The veranda of his home is already
overflowing with large and small pots.
He is in the throes of producing half
a dozen murals which combine broken
shards, metal, and complete shapes
arranged in varying levels. In the
neat garden, with its lawns and rotary
hoist, are more pieces, mostly sculptures
in biscuit clay.
“I have so much energy,” he said.
“But I have so many ideas that I can
only do a percentage of what I want
to do.” His interest in sculpture is
coming strongly through his work and
his latest pieces, though paying lip ser-
vice to the world of pots, are far more
figurative than useful.
There are no potters and no artists
in Skillitzi’s family. “Why shouldn’t
someone just appear?” he asks.
Skillitzi feels strongly that heredity
doesn’t come into art. Ability does,
and so far his teachers at the National
Art School, including Peter Rushforth,
have been proved right in their pre-
dictions that he is that rare creature,
a naturally gifted potter who can work
quickly and surely. He will be going
overseas next month to a pottery in
Denmark and thence to the Central
School of Arts and Crafts in London.

Mr. Ed’s Bailiwick
By DAVID McNICOLL
THE wise American, if he can avoid
it, doesn’t travel on his internal
airlines round Christmas and
New Year. It is hell. Delays, over-
bookings, cancellations, snafus of every
modern description. After five hours in
Dallas airport (where the Oasis Bar
serves only beer and light wine) waiting
for the Braniff plane to Austin, I was
reduced to reading and noting down
the names emblazoned on the uniforms
of the servicemen doing their best to
get home to Mom for Christmas. I
thought there’d be some tough ones—
Polish and so on —but they were pretty
straightforward - Ramsey, Carlson,
Yarbro, Clark, Hales, Brown, Leahy,
O’Dell, Lance, Hay, Eldridge, Thewlis.
An unrewarding way of killing time,
and a dull entry to Texas—Ambassador
Ed Clark’s bailiwick.
Things changed for the better at Aus-
tin. The place felt, as Mr. Ed might
say, cosy. Although the capital of Texas,
it is relatively small, and the airport is
correspondingly modest. Sam Winters,
one of Mr. Ed’s law partners, seemed
to find no trouble in picking me out,
and whisked me off to the Commodore
Perry Hotel, where I showered, and
then off to the Austin Club.
I should have got the message about
liquor from the restrictions in the Oasis
Bar at Dallas airport. But I didn’t, and
it was with some surprise that I realised
Texas has no bars (nor has it any
gambling—no racetracks, no casinos).
The liquor problem is resolved by
liquor stores, where the dreaded stuff
may be purchased and carted guiltily
home —or for the more affluent, by
membership of clubs, where your own
bottles are ostensibly always available.
Dinner with Sam Winters was a de-
lightful affair, and when I finally closed
my eyes in my room at the Commodore
Perry, thoughts of the tedious hours at
Dallas had been washed away.
IN Texas, it seems, nearly everyone
goes to church (except visiting Aus-
tralians). In fact, I am more and more
astonished and impressed at the church-
going enthusiasm of America’s more
established strata of citizens. Not for a
minute would I suggest that the Sunday
pilgrimages were not motivated by
genuine Christian enthusiasm for wor-
ship. But I have to conclude, after
watching the phenomenon in Connecti-
cut, Washington, and Texas, that there
is also some status symbol factor in-
volved. The young man making his
mark in the world should be seen going
to church. As with justice, not only
must worship be carried out, but it
must be seen to be carried out.
While my friends came to terms with
their Maker and I hope, put in a
cent’s worth for the visitor I wan-
dered up to Austin’s capitol a mag-
nificent domed edifice which, locals
claim, more than matches its Washing-
ton counterpart. A friendly uniformed
guide took me up in a lift, then by
stairs, to the dizzy heights of the dome.
His talk all the while was no doubt
full of fascinating facts and figures, but
it was hard to stop one’s eyes from
turning toward the nearby tower of
the University of Texas, from which
the crazed sniper last year picked off
hapless victims in one of the most in-
credible mass slayings in history. (The
University, which I visited a few days
later, is something to make our Univer-
sity administrators’ mouths water.
Endowment money has been poured in
from the oil benefactors, and the
University has blossomed with build-
ings of extraordinary architectural
beauty, with libraries, with auditoriums,
with electronic and TV teaching equip-
ment running into hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars. To say nothing of the
money spent by specially commissioned
scouts in far-off Sotheby’s to acquire
paintings and manuscripts [most of the
G.B.S. manuscripts, Dylan Thomas,
Somerset Maugham, Kipling, Heming-
way you name them, Texas U. has
them]. But I am getting ahead of my-
self.)
Sunday, from “brunch” on, was a
pretty memorable day. Sam Winters
and another of Ed Clark’s law partners,
Donald Thomas (who handles the bulk
of President Johnson’s business affairs),
took me to the ranch for the day.
But since I have written about the
visit to the L.B.J. ranch in some detail
in another publication, I will not repeat
it here. Sufficient to say that at 8.30
p.m., as the President saw us out of his
warm living-room and into Sam’s car,
I flashed on a light, grabbed a note-
book, and started to jot down every-
thing I could remember of the previous
six hours. I was still thinking and
jotting as we pulled into El Toro, a
superb-smelling Mexican restaurant in
Austin. Soon we were surrounded by
fried beans and tortillas, salads, and
great goblets of beer.
It’s funny about food. You will not
get really good steaks in restaurants in
Texas. And you will not get good
Mexican food in fashionable restaur-
ants in Mexico City. Yet you will get
superb Mexican food in Texas and
good steaks in Mexico.
Austin is a pleasant, friendly little
city. Everyone seems to know everyone
else, at least by sight. Lady Bird owns
the local TV station, and son-in-law,
Pat Nugent, was spending some of his
university vacation working there. The
main street is not unlike the main
street of, say, Newcastle. The traffic
is fairly light, the policemen are
friendly. Five-gallon hats are every-
where (I had been startled when my
two hosts, Sam Winters and Donald
Thomas, were, when we visited the
President’s ranch, suddenly transformed
from the sombre lawyers in smart suits
and snap-brim hats of the day before
into outdoor types in casual clothes and
five-gallon, pale grey hats).
'J'HE Texas hospitality is warm and
obviously sincere. Texans accept it
as natural that voyagers should wish to
visit The Hub of the Universe, but they
are, nevertheless, flattered and pleased.
The homes of the well-to-do are, in-
side and out, not unlike the houses in
Toorak except that fences are non-
existent and trees are taller and more
prolific. It was getting on for Christ-
mas, and the decorations, in and out-
side the homes, had to be seen to be
believed.
The night before I left I was a
guest at the Christmas party of ex-
Governor Shivers, a tall, distinguished
man from whom exuded the unaffected
and quiet charm which seems to come
naturally to many Texans. His house
no, dammit, no word but mansion
will suffice is like the principal set
from “Gone With the Wind.” Huge-
white columns right across the front
of the house, stretching up to the top
of the second floor. They had been
festooned with lights, and I report
with a little sadness that they were
wired in some way that made the
huge columns appear to be spinning
round. It was just a little too much,
and not quite in accord with Gov-
ernor Shivers’ dignity.
Each reception room in the man-
sion and there were six that I saw
contained a huge Christmas tree
bedecked with lights and goodies.
Through hidden microphones soft
carols were sung, and in large glisten-
ing white cages, flocks of pure white
doves cooed a peaceful Christmas
message. Toward the rear of the
house tables exhibited to the charmed
guests bowls of punch, hot meats,
salads, fruits, ices you name it, it
was there. I’ve seen some pretty fair
Christmas parties, but Governor
Shivers wins my inscribed gunmetal
fob watch and his party was only
a little affair to “howdy” the neigh-
bors.
I’m not sure whether Ambassador

Clark had given his Texas friends the
impression that I was Prime Minister
Holt’s principal adviser, but I began
to wonder when I found I was to be
guest-of-honor at a lunch in the Head-
liners’ Club. Politicians, judges, oil
tycoons, local professional, and business-
men, all eager to hear how Ed Clark
was getting on in the Antipodes, and
not very surprised to learn that he had
visited places many Australians had
never heard of. The main course had
hardly been cleared when John Hill,
Secretary of State for Texas, got to
his feet, welcomed me, and presented
me with a document, signed and sealed
by Governor Connally, making me an
Honorary Citizen of Texas.
I think my last day in Texas gives a
picture of Texas’ warmth, open-
handedness and veiled influence. I
was due to fly to Acapulco, and as
bookings in and out of Mexico round
Christmas are like precious gold, I had
confirmed (in New York a week
before) a flight from Austin to Hous-
ton, where I was to catch an originating
Pan-Am plane to Mexico. The book-
ings were firm and I felt happy about
them.
But Donald Thomas, of Austin,
Texas, didn’t. To him it made no sense
to fly at crack of dawn to Houston
when there was a direct daily flight
from San Antonio to Acapulco. I ex-
plained patiently that I’d tried for that
flight it was booked solid for weeks.
That merely made Thomas reach for a
phone and start talking to Dallas.
There was mention of my unhappy
delay a few days earlier, mention of
Ed Clark, mention of Australia. Then
“well, that’s OK, you’re on the
direct flight,” he said. I found out later
he’d been on to the president of Braniff
Airlines. Nothing like going to the
roof.
, 'J'HEN there was the question of get-
ting the 100 miles to San Antonio.
My friends seized my tickets, and
booked me on a flight out of Austin
about 10.30. It would get me to San
Antonio by 11.30, in time to connect
with the Braniff to Acapulco, leaving
soon after noon. ,
I woke on the last day slightly
hung, a combination of Governor
Shivers’ punch and a lethal Scotch
Mist produced by a wonderful Austin
citizen named Morin Scott, who should
be placed under restraint when visitors
are about. I packed, sent my bags to
the lobby of the Commodore Perry,
and went down to wait for Donald
Thomas to pick me up. Ten o’clock
came. No word from Thomas. I
started to tense up, then rang the
airline to see how the Austin-San
Antonio plane was going. It was run-
ning two hours late!
By this time it was panic stations.
I wasn’t going to miss that plane out
of San Antonio. I grabbed the bell
captain, asked him to get a cab and
find what it would cost to take me
to San Antonio. He hurried back
yes, he had a taxi, and it would be
42 dollars. I was about to get my
bags to the cab when I was paged
it was Donald Thomas. Yes, he knew
about the delay, and oh, hell, send
the taxi away. He’d send his car round
for me, and we’d think about getting
to San Antonio somehow or other.
You get to a stage when it’s no
good sweating any more. I reached
it. Donald Thomas was studying his
watch, and checking whether the
Braniff plane out of San Antonio would
be leaving on time. Then he picked
up a phone and asked for Ruben
Johnson. Did he have a plane avail-
able? Two engines? Two drivers? OK,
we’d be ready soon.
Twenty minutes later I was soar-
ing up from Austin airport in a twin-
engined Beechcraft, Ruben Johnson
and another pilot sitting in front of me.
We skimmed in the shimmering Texas
sun over the expressways, the brown
fields, irrigated pastures, the huge Air
Force bases, the lakes, the hamlets.
Then we were over San Antonio and
getting a priority landing.
The little plane touched down, a
pigmy among the jets. A voice from
the control tower crackled permission
for us to go right to the terminal
where the Braniff 727 was standing.
We unloaded the bags. The Braniff
hosties turned on their best hostie
smiles. Ruben and the pilot waved
goodbye, and the Beechcraft turned
away. I sank into my seat, thinking how
crazy I’d been ever to imagine I would
have missed the plane. The hostess
poured a martini as the plane took off.
“We will soon,” said the pilot, “be
crossing the Rio Grande, on your left.”
The Do-Not-Disturb Princess
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
Perhaps it was too much to
expect a Royal Presence . . . Prin-
cess Dmitri Romanoff had just
finished reading her own handout (as
opposed to the official one issued by
Fourways Travel with which she is
connected through her agency, Mil-
banke Travel) written during the night
on a stack of DO NOT DISTURB
cards belonging to the Australia Hotel,
and Prince Dmitri, squatting on the
end of a twin bed, had corrected the
long, involved facts of their Russian
ancestry for the umpteenth time, when
the opposition arrived.
The lady journalist looked at us
crossly and said she thought it was an
exclusive. We said we didn’t mind
sharing and, anyway, another lady
journalist was arriving soon, so ex-
clusivity didn’t come into it. (That one
had even threatened the Princess that
next weekend would be too late, she’d
be on to other celebrities by then.) At
that point a photographer threw him-
self on his knees, and for a moment
conversation ceased. We gazed at him
hopefully, but alas, his was not a royal
greeting from one fellow exile to
anotheh he was searching for angles on
the royal chin.
“Shall I say cheese?” inquired Prin-
cess Dmitri. “No, I’ll use the word
Douglas Fairbanks taught me, and it
wasn’t cheese.”
“That’s Sir Douglas, isn’t it?” asked

the lady journalist scribbling fast, while
the photographer hobbled round on his
knees snapping chins left, right, and
centre. We had the feeling this would
go on all day, but the lady journalist
said rather sharply that that would do,
and he hove-to, winked at Princess
Dmitri, God blessed her and departed.
At this point the Princess announced
her intention of reading the DO NOT
DISTURB cards all over again, add-
ing, for reasons we could not follow,
that she had entitled it “To the Cruel
Press Gang.” In the interim we
checked notes made before the opposi-
tion’s arrival.
Princess Dmitri, born Sheila Chis-
holm, of Woollongorang Station, near
Goulburn, married first to Lord Lough-
borough, then Sir John Milbanke (they
both died), and now to the nephew of
Tsar Nicholas 11, the last reigning
Romanoff, was here by the grace of
Milbanke Travel Agency “to get a
lot of rich Australians to travel my
way.” Her way is package-deal coach
trips to Europe from England for
£stg.so a fortnight, from Australia to
Europe at Lstg.bOO for three months.
rpHE agency, set up behind a counter
at Fortnum and Mason’s, did well
despite friends’ warnings to the con-
trary, and now there are Milbanke
agencies all over Britain. The secret of
success, she said, is payment in ad-
vance; this is all right when dealing
with large business firms who pay on
the dot, but terrible when dealing with
rich friends who do not. Their profit
was only six percent, and that meant
having to go to your best friends and
say, darling, do you realise you owe
us a thousand pounds? So Princess
Dmitri prefers dealing with big firms
or small typists, who also pay on the
dot.
We were working hard with the next
bit of Pitman’s when the opposition
asked if it was all right to describe
Fortnum and Mason’s as a department
store. We thought that would go down
a treat in Piccadilly. “Tell me, Prin-
cess, are you conscious of much social
change in England today?” (Hers was
an interview in depth.) Well, the young
ones had no staff nowadays and when
they married they had to choose
between a cook and a nanny. She, how-
ever, had two staff in their little Bel-
gravia house, a stone’s throw from
Buckingham Palace.
By this time we had deciphered the
Pitman’s, and it read: “Princess Dmitri
cannot sleep at night with flowers in
the room. She gave the whole lot to
her nephew and his wife, with whom
she had had lunch that day, for their
party in the evening. When asked to
carry them down for his wife the
nephew refused, and Princess Dmitri
said his mother should have slapped
his bottom as a child.”
The “Sunday Mirror” arrived then.
Princess Dmitri, in determined fashion,
stretched out once more for her DO
NOT DISTURB cards . . .


A Rewarding, if Unrewarded, Life
By APRIL HERSEY
BORN with the most ornate
of silver spoons in her
mouth, Lady (Jessie)
Street, long-time supporter of the
rights of women, pushed aside the
easy life which was hers to
take on the unpopular role of
feminist. Her recently published
book, “Truth or Repose,” which,
incidentally, she says, went from
publisher to publisher for many
years before the Australasian
Book Society decided to take a
chance, provides ample evidence
of the mountain of work that this
very able woman achieved in a
lifetime of unrewarded public
office.
Dubbed as a Communist be-
cause of her interest in and de-
votion to the USSR in the war
years, she says she was actually
a staunch Labor supporter.
Though she fell out with Labor
over a pre-selection contretemps,
she was never, she says, a mem-
ber of the Communist Party.
“Why should I be?” she said.
“They didn’t have any women on
their executive. I was really only
interested in getting an equal
opportunity for women and,
of course, in peace.”
Now 77, Lady Street has no
intention of retiring from the
battle. “I feel that when I’m in-
capable I’ll have no choice, but
in the meantime I’d like to keep
an eye on what is happening in
the world.” She plans another trip
overseas shortly and will be giving
lectures wherever she goes and joining
discussions with international women’s
organisations.
Lady Street’s obsessive feminism
dates from her earliest years in India,
when she blamed her new baby brother
for her mother’s ill health. Characteris-
tically straightforward, she suggested
they might throw him over a nearby
cliff and remove the problem. Her
mother quickly realised her three-year-
old daughter was being neglected and
gave her more attention. But later,
travelling home to Australia, there was
no way to explain to a lively eight-year-
old why boys were allowed the run of
the ship and girls were not.
Again, on her grandfather’s remark-
able property “Yulgilbar,” on the
Clarence River in northern New South
Wales, where she became friendly with
the stationhands, she had to accept the
fact that once she had passed the age
of ten all sorts of restrictions descended
upon her. In the interests of turning
her into “a little lady” she was called
in from the noonday sun, expected to
take an interest in a canary instead of
the horses, and hopefully seated at a
piano for hours each day. After praying
Lady Street
desperately that she might turn into a
boy, she resolved to fight back. This she
did so enthusiastically that when she
was removed to school in England she
was affectionately known as the Bush-
ranger.
The headmistress of the school,
Wycombe Abbey, was called Miss Dove,
but this gentle title hovered above a
very unlikely head. Miss Dove felt that
girls should not only be educated but
should be physically fit. Despite the
cries from Harley Street that her girls
would never be able to have children
after all this muscle-building, she in-
stalled a gymnasium and, as well, had
the girls play hockey, cricket, tennis,
and golf. She pursued them about the
grounds on a tricycle. She also insisted
they read the newspapers. All this had
a very strong effect on the Bushranger
from Australia.
When at 17 the rebellious Jessie re-
turned to Australia, she was determined
to get to a university. She wanted to
start another Wycombe Abbey in Aus-
tralia. The school never eventuated, but
our heroine made it to the university—
no mean feat for a girl in the pre-
World War I years. She introduced
hockey there, and was in turn intro-
duced to young Kenneth Street, who
helped her unravel her first
treasurer’s report for the Sydney
University Dramatic Society.
With the help of coaches and
posts Jessie emerged from the
university with a BA and a
“secret engagement” to Kenneth
Street.
He had several more years of
study before him, so his fiancee
returned with her family to Eng-
land to see her brother, who was
still in school there. She also
joined the battling suffragettes.
Her bemused parents, by this
time inured to life with their
eldest, let her take part in dem-
onstrations, do house-to-house
canvassing, and sell the paper
“Votes for Women.”
She was also plunging, along
with millions of others, into
World War I, and in the long
run into a very different world
for women. The war permitted
her the luxury of getting a
driver’s licence and a mechanic’s
certificate, but not the right to
drive an ambulance in France.
Bitterly disappointed, she went
instead to America and worked
at a settlement house trying to
stamp out organised prostitution.
Before she could become too
involved, her husband-to-be
graduated and they were able to
marry.
For a few years Jessie Street
(who tried hard to retain her
maiden name after marriage) settled
down to domesticity and produced her
four children. But she was by no
means the stereotyped wife and
mother. Clothes, bridge, and the social
set were not her milieu.
Hers was the world of the Feminist
Club, the United Association of
Women, and the League of Nations.
She developed a flourishing private
business, the House Service Company,
which provided well-trained domestic
staff.
The depression of the ’thirties pushed
her into a wholehearted acceptance, in
theory, at least, of socialism. She tried
to organise a rebuilding program in
Glebe, worked out a social benefits
scheme, studied the nationalisation of
banking, and joined the Labor Party.
Spearheading every deputation to
Parliament, whether it was to have
married women teachers keep their
jobs or get a woman appointed Child
Endowment Commissioner, was the
übiquitous Mrs. Jessie Street.
Possibly the turning point in her life
was when in 1938 on a Grand Tour
with her second daughter, Philippa, she
included the USSR in her itinerary.
It was not considered safe to travel
there, certainly not for two unaccom-

panied women. Unless conversion to
another ideology is unsafe, no harm
came to the Streets. Instead, they were
fascinated by the role women were
playing in the re-birth of Russia. This
began when they discovered, after
panting along the platform beside the
train to confirm their suspicions, that
a woman was actually driving the train
to Moscow!
Jessie Street’s love affair with the
Russians began at that moment. When
she returned she lectured all over the
world, and industriously, if perhaps un-
wisely for her own career, sang the
praises of the new regime. During
World War II her name became
synonymous with “Sheepskins for
Russia.”
She also worked hard for the Labor
Party and was eventually allowed to
contest a seat. It was the blue ribbon
Liberal seat of Wentworth and she
very nearly won it from Eric Harrison.
Finally, in 1945, her ability was
recognised by Prime Minister Curtin.
Despite opposition (mainly from Harri-
son) she was invited to join the Aus-
tralian delegation of the United Nations
Conference of International Organisa-
tions at San Francisco with Dr. H. V.
Evatt and Deputy Prime Minister
Forde.
JF Curtin had not died during that
San Francisco conference, Mrs.
Street might have held an important
position in this country, but despite her
work at the conference and her con-
tinued work on committees in Aus-
tralia she did not rise to international
heights again. She feels now that she
has achieved very little “except that
most people including women
regard me as slightly potty about the
rights of women.”
In her own two daughters and the
granddaughters among her 14 grand-
children, she had no converts to the
ranks of the feminist cause. Both her
daughters married and did not pursue a
separate career.
Her own ability to pursue such a
lively career with dozens of overseas
trips was partly because of the efficient
staff at home, and surely also the rather
Job-like patience of her husband, Sir
Kenneth Street, Lieutenant-Governor
of N.S.W. He appears never to have
questioned her right to her own ideasj
to have sheltered her as much as
possible from the trials of social life,
and encouraged this free soul, who
even now at an age when most women
are content to potter about and live
vicariously through their children, is
President of the Australian Soviet
Friendship Society, carries about a
copy of the United Nations Charter for
ready reference, and dashes on carry-
ing the flag for women’s rights whether
anybody wants to see it or not. Only
once does Sir Kenneth seem to have
wavered. After a particularly awful
gaffe from Jessie at a large party when
someone said: “Who is that young
woman?” he looked down the room,
adjusted his glasses, and said: “I
haven’t the faintest idea.”


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
James Sharman talks to Gurry Shead
I LEFT school at 16, but as a child I travelled with my
father (Jimmy Sharman’s Boxing Troupe) and saw
Sorlie’s touring vaudeville shows. I went through school
interested in theatre and little else. At school I formed an
amateur musical society, doing Gilbert and Sullivan. God
knows why. Sixteen-year-old G. and S. producers weren’t
very fashionable then, but I formed a company and put on
a G. and S. opera at the Conservatorium for £9OO. It
worked out all right and I took heart.
I then became a messenger boy in an advertising agency,
and at the ABC, which didn’t think I’d make a producer.
I then studied at NIDA for two years, formed the Group
Theatre, which did “A Taste of Hofiey.” This led to a job
at the Old Tote. In the meantime I did Punch and Judy
at the Warringah Mall shopping centre. This has been my
most financially rewarding venture.
At the Old Tote I felt I was tying myself down too
early to a conventional pattern of work. I wanted to experi-
ment. I did the On Stage Oz Revue, “The Doll’s House,”
and some teaching, then resigned. I did 14 productions in 12
months, which brought me to Genet’s “The Maids.”
I admire Genet as a playwright. He never attacks society.
He wipes out the values of society. “Without thieves there
are no judges.”
The theatre today seems to me redundant and decadent.
It does not serve the purpose for which it is meant. I’m
still trying to find out what it should say, what it’s supposed
to do.
I hate apathy and complacency. I think the apathy in
Australia must outweigh that of any other country. This is
why I like being here. I want to go overseas desperately,
but I’d like to find ideas from this country and bring them
out instead of trying to transplant rather interesting things
I saw in London or America.
My sense of humor is very camp. I generally laugh louder
than anybody at funny plays. People say to me, we heard
you there last night.
A Very Healthy Atmosphere
By APRIL HERSEY
THE drama complex at the Uni-
versity of N.S.W. begins 1967 with
its head, Professor Robert Quen-
tin, a full professor instead of an asso-
ciate. Professor Quentin’s rise in the
scale has not yet been accompanied by
a larger budget for his activities; a
second season of Australian plays at
Jane Street this year is still in doubt
and there seem to be no firm plans for
a new building to replace the Old Tote
theatre. However, Professor Quentin,
a model of determination, remains
sanguine.
“There is great talent in Australia,”
Quentin said. “I think this has been
proven by the fact that 70 percent of
the graduates from NIDA have found
employment. But the theatre itself and
its importance depend upon the writers.
If live theatre is ever to re-establish
itself completely in Australia, we must
produce new Australian plays.”
So far the Jane Street writers have
not been able to make much money
out of their plays. They are offered
from five to ten percent of the gross
takings. The gross takings, of course,
are not particularly high, because as a
whole the Australian public is not de-
voted to watching plays.
“They are usually minority
audiences,” Professor Quentin said.
“The Jane Street shows were very good,
but I don’t know that all live theatre
in Australia is worth encouraging just
because it is live. One thing that
gives me the horrors right round the
world is the pretentious attitude that
implies there is some high moral virtue
in attending the live theatre. The first
business of actors and producers is to
please the audience. If they don’t do
that they don’t deserve to be popular.”
Quentin himself has been involved
with the professional theatre for many
years, both as an actor and as a pro-
ducer. From Oxford he was precipi-
tated into “a very gentlemanly war” in
Naval Intelligence for five years. At
war’s end he was in Sydney and was
discharged to serve with J. C. William-
son’s. True to their fashion, the firm
was preparing to launch Cyril Ritchard
and Madge Elliot in a remount of “The
Dancing Years.” Quentin was the pro-
ducer.
“J. C. Williamson’s have much to be
blamed for,” he feels. “In continually
using the safe overseas success with the
dreadful recipe of imported stars and
local talent in the chorus, they did
much to repress the Australian theatre.
But at the same time they did keep
going when all the other theatrical
managements had given up putting on
any sort of a live show.”
They Were too much for young
Quentin, however, and he went back
to England. He produced plays at the
Bristol Old Vic. This led to his being
made a director at the London Old
Vic. Later Quentin toured the United
States lecturing. He was invited back
to Australia to be general manager of
the opera company of the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust.
Though no longer associated with
this, Quentin feels there is a rosy
future for opera in Australia if the
Trust abandons its full interstate tours.
“It seemed feasible at first,” he said.
“But it has been proved so wrong so
often. It isn’t possible to defeat the
geography of Australia. Re-establishing
resident companies in Melbourne and
Sydney would be the answer now.”
“Coping with great distances in Aus-

tralia is a unique problem for our
theatrical entrepreneurs, whether they
are dealing with the Beatles or the
ballet. Touring is great experience for
actors, but touring out here is very far
removed from the touring done in pro-
vincial English towns and cities.”
Quentin feels there is a very healthy
atmosphere in Australia at present as
far as the theatre is concerned. “There
is so much more interest than there
was ten years ago. For a while there
were no producers, but now they are
coming forward. The TV screen has
mopped up a lot of the middlebrow and
lowbrow entertainers who used to take
up space on the stage. I have always
felt that the Government did us all a
great disservice in allowing a liberal
issue of television licences but in
this particular instance they did some
good.
“As far as the Trust is concerned,
a lot of the criticism levelled at it has
been justified, though some has been
purely a matter of ‘knocking’. The
root of their trouble has always been
the ambiguity of trying to subsidise and
produce at the same time. It is an
invidious and a difficult situation,”
Quentin said. “But anyone who has
talent in Australia—talent for acting or
producing or writing—should find an
outlet before long.”
ON FILM
Can You Bank on Films?
AS 1967 begins, plans are develop-
ing rapidly for feature films in
this area. Kenneth Herts, of
Herts Productions, a B-picture unit in
Hollywood, told me recently that he
plans to make Westerns here: even if
he has to fly in American stars, direc-
tor, and unit, it will still be cheaper
than making them in Hollywood. Brian
Chirlian of Ajax Films in Sydney has
recently returned from America with
a folio of plans for cut-cost American
pictures and TV series: Ajax’s studios
can produce more cheaply than Holly-
wood, and provide first-class equipment.
Robert Vaughn’s company has bought
properties. In view of a whole succes-
sion of previous plans, all fallen through
and ranging from Karel Reisz’s “Ned
Kelly” to Albert Zugsmith’s thriller
with Nina Foch to be shot off the
South Australian coast, one might be
forgiven some scepticism: but now
shooting has started on a feature:
“Journey Out of Darkness,” from a
screen play by Howard Koch, whose
script for Wyler’s “The Letter” remains
a masterpiece of romantic melodrama.
Neither producer (Frank Brittain)
nor director (James Trainor) has
worked on a feature before, and both
have sprung from a documentary back-
ground: Brittain in industrial films,
Trainor in United Nations work and
TV. “Journey Out of Darkness” is in-
tended for the Festivals it will be
too late for Cannes, but will be entered
for Venice and, perhaps, Berlin. Brit-
tain envisages for it a succes d’estime,
which will launch it on the art houses
in New York: these are held in small
chains for instance, the showman
Don Rugoff owns ten in that city. “A
picture can recoup its costs in a few
months playing at the art houses on
those chains or circuits,” Mr. Brittain
said. This seems to open up a possible
area in film-making here no one has
thought of to date: films made for
art houses only, with no attempt to
break into the major overseas markets.
The story of “Journey out of Dark-
ness” about a white policeman sent
out of Cooper’s Creek to arrest an
Aboriginal, and the way the policeman
discovers himself as a man in the
process—sounds like a routine B-picture
“actioner,” a Western with an Aus-
tralian locale. But Brittain insists it
will be every bit as much an art picture
as a Bergman production. How about
backing for future productions? “This
business is a banking business. I’ve
talked to bankers here. So far they’ve
not been interested. They’ve told me
Australian films have failed to show a
profit in the past. But ‘The Mob’ has
already started to make them sway a
little. Of course, they agree that the
Bank of America got Hollywood go-
ing. But we will have to prove our
ability to make money with the success
of this first picture before they will
finance others. They have to be sure
of a profit.”
Mr. Brittain produced a sheaf of im-
migration papers to show he intended
staying here for good. His company is
to be permanently stationed in Sydney,
which he sees as another Hollywood
or Rome of the future. First camera-
man on “Journey Out of Darkness”
will be Andrew Fraser, whose work on
the NLT series “If These Walls Could
Speak” was described to me as brilliant
by Vincent Price, its star. Supreme
Sound will supply unit, processing
(Eastmancolor) and all other facilities,
and part financing. Some American
financing is rumored to come from
Martin Luther King’s organisation,
interested in the racial angle: in which
case Ed Devereaux’s casting as the
Aboriginal is surely odd.
Mr. Brittain’s comments on “The
Mob” are significant: although Wil-
liamson-Powell will not make figures
available, a recent visitor, Mr. Reginald
Baker, former head of Ealing Studios,
told me it will take $3,000,000 in ticket
sales in Australia. Even if 50 percent
of main theatre takings goes back to
the distributors, Greater Union (said
by Mr. Baker to be the arrangement
with GU), this still leaves a hefty slice
in the Williamson-Powell kitty for
future films, and a strong encourage-
ment to the bankers for projects like
Mr. Brittain’s.

ART
Layman’s Dilemmas
THE intelligent layman certainly
feels increasingly frustrated in his
attempt to understand modern
art. This layman came into view about
1900, just when art began to reject
reality and increasingly to accelerate
changes in its appearance. No sooner
has a new art and its raison d’etre
been grasped than the layman (and
others) is told by the vehemently
polemical supporters of a new move-
ment to cast out the old. He begins to
feel with Wyndham Lewis in “The
Demon of Progress in the Arts” that
all this restlessness is unhealthy, that
the artist’s fickleness in changing his
style is a sure sign of loss of integrity
and seriousness.
In fact, he’ll find these last two terms
rejected by some artists as irrelevant
moral judgments when applied to the
creative impulses and he’ll find, too,
that some spokesmen for the new
squared-up paintings and grey box-
sculpture think “creative” a word
almost as dirty as “brush stroke” (an
anachronism that should have gone
with Van Gogh) and that art as the
symbol of human torments and aspira-
tions is vague metaphorical evasiveness,
fit for people who can only think of
art as an anthropomorphic syndrome.
It is little wonder that not only lay-
men, but also critics and social
theorists, tend to regard artistic changes
as mere fashions, little different from
what comes from the House of Dior
or from what is run up in Carnaby
Street; but the situation is even more
complex, for while some laymen beat
a retreat others join what New York
critics Hess and Rosenberg call the
avant-garde audience that demands
novelty for novelty’s sake a phrase
designed to perturb, but which doesn’t
necessarily exclude art.
'pHESE two attitudes—avoidance and
pressure-group involvement stem
from the impudent notion that art
should appeal to and communicate with
all the people all the time, a notion
that the specialised collections of the
great collectors refute. The layman’s
frequent phrase “I cannot understand
it” should be taken for what it is: a
normal confession rather than a criti-
cal evaluation.
A common way of justifying the
vagaries of art to the layman is that
adopted by Katherine Kuh in her
“Modern Art Explained,” where, in
tracing the increasing (?) fragmenta-
tion of forms, she refers to analogous
changes in science: X-ray is related to
sculptural penetration of space; “As
scientists smashed the atom, so, like-
wise, artists smashed traditional forms”;
and surrealism grew out of Freudian
theories. But it is always more com-
plex than this: Freud thought surreal-
ists 95 percent lunatic and that there
would be no art unless a proportion
were kept between pre-conscious elab-
oration and unconscious elements; X-
ray drawings were done by Aborigines
without the benefits of Rontgen.
Curiously, the science used by artists
is usually out of date; Miss Kuh, for
example, has no references to topology,
electronics, or non-particles. Her and
others’ comforting theories of art’s
mirroring the progress of science have
received a jolt froPn Marshall McLuhan
(“The Gutenberg Galaxy” and “Under-
standing Media”), who thinks art is
increasingly anti-environmental, is less
concerned about personal expression,
and more with being an Early Warning
System against certain technological
changes in our environment; it sharpens
awareness and alerts people to the con-
fining and distorting power of their
cultures. He would say that those who
explain away art by scientific analogies
really want to silence the Early Warn-
ing System, something done, too, by
the popular art of the masses and that
of the academy.
Anti-environmental art contends, but
does not compete with the new tech-
nologies that, says McLuhan, view the
public as an almost corporate, undif-
ferentiated consumer; in fact new tech-
nologies contain old content; for
example, TV did not become a real


part of the environment until it ceased
being an old movie in a box; when
the mechanical movement enveloped
the agrarian world, the status of folk,
primitive and landscape art rose. They
became the content of the new techni-
cal processes. Art - cubism and archi-
tecture became more mechanical-
looking as the electronic age replaced
the mechanical. , What happens
(McLuhan writes sentences that are
neither universals or particulars, by the
way) is that the content of art is always
a past technology. Science is never
immediately reflected in the content
of art. What is debatable in McLuhan
is that he thinks the content quite un-
important, but what is important for
our layman is that in attempting to
cope with art he need not plunge into
a scientific course from optics to elec-
tronics, but simply do what any seeker
after aesthetic experience does when
confronted by the bewildering array of
art from Altamira to the new Eccentric
Abstraction, seek the unique aesthetic
object: he has, and needs, our sympathy.
ELWYN LYNN
FILMS
Summer Frippery
FROM Christmastime on, we’re
generally stuck with a few light-
weight movies which stay put in
the theatres for some little time and
which are usually described as “school
holiday fare.” This year hasn’t been
typical; certainly Disney, Presley, and
the “Carry On” mob have made their
ritual appearance, but the majority of
releases haven’t been primarily aimed
at child audiences or even at adults
on holiday.
The only release worth serious con-
sideration is “The Professionals,” a very-
satisfactory Western directed with un-
obtrusive expertise by Richard Brooks
- a welcome change from the pompous
self-importance of “Lord Jim”! “The
Professionals” has some sensible things
to say, but lets its “message” be car-
ried implicitly, without stopping the
action for the players to indulge in
moralising.
The same can’t be said for “Cast A
Giant Shadow,” a garrulous, didactic
film about the fight for Israeli indepen-
dence. Its main fault is or was,
since it didn’t last long in Sydney
its dullness; but one could also object
to its portrayal of a bloody war as a
jolly, adventurous business and its impli-
cation that the Israeli cause was won
single-handed by Kirk Douglas.
“Lost Command” is much given to
moralising, too, but thanks to a diversity
of accents the soundtrack is often in-
comprehensible, so that the philo-
sophical discussions can easily be
ignored. This, too, is set in a country
struggling for independence Algeria
this time and this film does manage
to give some impression of the bitter-
ness of a people torn by civil war, and
of the senseless, vengeful slaughter.
There are a few genuine summer-
holiday fripperies, but with the excep-
tion of “That Darn Cat” they’re a
mediocre lot. There’s some mild fun in
“The Russians Are Coming, The
Russians Are Coming”; the two Eng-
lish comedies “Carry On, Cowboy”
and “The Great St. Trinians Train
Robbery” rely heavily on respectable
old dirty jokes and on their appeal to
a readymade audience (so they hope).
Fortunately, both of them employ a
team of comedians expert enough to
make the whole thing seem rather
funnier than it is.
The one juvenile adventure story,
“Around the World Under the Sea,”
fails chiefly by trying to appeal to
adults as well. This story of submarine-
borne scientists planting earthquake-
warning systems on the sea bed is
badly slowed up by ponderous and
unnecessary scientific explanations.
If you want to take children to the
pictures, your bet is undoubtedly
Disney’s “That Darn Cat.” Since there’s
plenty of action and some good
knockabout comedy it will entertain
the children acceptably while also pro-
viding considerable amusement for the
host. This engaging movie has a lot
to offer older members of the audi-
ence its self-reliant feline star,
treated not coyly but with the dignity
an animal warrants; its disrespectful
attitude to the FBI; the sophisticated
comedy playing of Roddy McDowall
and Elsa Lanchester.

The Married State
The Family Game. Adapted by Hugh
Leonard from Celimare, le Bien-
Aime, by Eugene Labiche. Inde-
pendent, Sydney.
You Wouldn’t Read About It. Peter
O’Shaughnessy. Peninsula Playhouse,
Avalon.
IN farce, all husbands are cuckolds
and, what is more, ,they deserve
to be, for they are either very old
or very boring, very suspicious or com-
pletely unsuspecting, but, in any case,
invariably absurd. In this play Labiche
has had the pleasant idea of making
the lover a figure of fun, too, although,
of course, he still retains some of his
traditional glamor.
Celimare has managed to reach
middle age without marrying and be-
coming involved in the tedium of
bourgeois domesticity. Instead, he
spends his evenings with his mistress,
and her husband, playing dominoes.
However, when Celimare decides to
marry a young wife, the husbands of
his two successive mistresses, M. Ver-
nouillet and M. Bocardon, feel that
politeness requires that they repay
Celimare’s assiduity in visiting them.
With a good cast, attractive settings,
and gay and amusing costumes by
Michelle, Peter Summerton’s enjoyable
production is well suited to the holi-
day season. As Celimare, Allan Trevor
achieves the right mixture of the
romantic and the absurd. Beleaguered
as he is by the husbands (Tom Farley
and John Armstrong) and suspected of
preferring men to women by his
mother-in-law (Pat McDonald) Celi-
mare is finally extricated from his diffi-
culties by his poker-faced valet, who is
a kind of young Jeeves, French-style.
As this supposed virgin, Max Meldrum
shows himself a master of deadpan
comedy.
Within a very short time, perhaps
only in the past ten years, Australia has
gained a new past. Before that our
history was either an embarrassment
or a bore: convicts being flogged or
sheep being raised, while our literature
was something to be endured in the
schoolroom or recited at country con-
certs. But now that we have finally
accepted the fact that we are a modern,
urban, industrial society, our past has
both receded and become more colorful
and more acceptable.
Peter O’Shaughnessy’s program of
Australiana, which he presents with
great verve and professional skill, is a
lively illustration of this new attitude
to our history and our literature. His
well-chosen selection ranges from
Dampier’s matter-of-fact description of
the flies swarming on the faces of the
Aborigines, through Sturt’s exciting
description of his boat suddenly shoot-
ing out of the rapid stream of the
Murrumbidgee into the broad waters
of the Murray, to Barry Humphries’
comic but appalling picture of the
bleakness of cosy suburban domesticity
in “Sandy Stone.” The visiting English-
man, D. H. Lawrence, contributes a
sensitive description of wattle in the
bush, while the Australian Judith
Wright provides a controlled but
deeply felt celebration of her Aus-
tralian heritage in “South of My Day’s
Circle.”
Two pieces by convicts remind us
that not all the convicts were thieves or
thugs. An Irish rebel describes with
raw-nerved vigor the flogging of two of
his fellows—men of courage and prin-
ciple. Then there is the rollicking
ballad by Frank the poet called “The
Convict’s Tour of Hell,” which peoples
hell with governors and overseers and
reserves heaven for convicts.
This heralds a tradition of comic
criticism—a form of adjustment to the
harshness of life in a tough country —
which we see in Lawson’s bush sketches.
More recently our writers have been
taking a cool, comic look at some of
our cherished legends. We see this in
Shaw Neilson’s poem “The Sundowner”
and in Alan Seymour’s description of
the drunken, vomiting “celebration” of
Anzac Day by Alf and his mates in
“The One Day of the Year.” We do
not see it in the extract from “They’re
a Weird Mob,” which is the nadir of
the evening.
The highlight of the evening is the
Sentimental Bloke’s very lively essay
in dramatic criticism: his translation of
“Romeo and Juliet” into the vernacular
of “Little Lon.”

BOOKS
Sex and Sunday Suits
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
Coast to Coast: 1965-1966. Edited by
Clement Semmler. Angus and
Robertson. $3.
THIS anthology of Australian short
stories, published over the past two
years, contains twenty-four stories
by an equal number of writers, and to
detect any perceptible trend along which
these writers are developing is like try-
ing to pick which direction the prickles
of a prickly pear are pointing. There
just is no specific direction in which
even a moderate number of these writers
is going. Each is picking his own track
through the wildwood.
It is a compliment to the editor,
Clement Semmler, that he has cast his
net sufficiently wide to make the con-
tents of his anthology difficult to clas-
sify. I feel an anthologist should be
catholic in his taste, unless he is that
very rare bird who by his very selec-
tion is able to set a whole new literary
movement on its feet.
The first of the stories which I found
outstanding was “Four Sunday Suits”
by Alan Marshall. Its theme is the
tangle of sexual relationships in a
country town, and it is a masterpiece of
humor and tenderness.
The other outstanding humorous
piece in the book was Hal Porter’s
“Say to Me Ronald!” Whereas Marshall
relies on a deliciously constructed plot
and a beautifully understated narrative,
Hal Porter achieves his effects by bom-
barding and dazzling the reader with
words. The story deals with the antics
of the son of a Singapore millionaire
at an Adelaide school in World War 11,
a delicate sylph-like Chinese who has a
charming persistence and the result is
brilliantly successful. The two other
short stories which impressed me par-
ticularly both strike a more serious
note. They were “Pioneers,” by John
Morrison, and “The Full Belly,” by
Patrick White.
“Pioneers” is a story concerning an
encounter with an old couple who were
pioneers in a country district. The story
has a claustrophobic atmosphere which
intensifies as it progresses. This is one
of those rare stories which evoke the
grimness of the Australian outback with
great power. It is almost a complete
success. I am not sure that the ending
completely escapes melodrama, but the
story is really so good, up until then,
that this does not really matter.
“The Full Belly” is set in Greece.
It avoids the satirical note that creeps
into many of White’s stories set in
one’s own kitchen and takes as its
subject matter what is close to hand.
It is interesting that in “Riders in the
Chariot” White is generally less satiri-
cal when dealing with a European en-
vironment. The lack of satire in “The
Full Belly” does not prevent it from
being a very stark and savage story.
There is a certain indirectness about
White’s narrative method in “The Full
Belly” which means that he is able to
bring off his big moments without laps-
ing into obviousness. The conclusion
of “Pioneers” by comparison seems a
trifle too inevitable. Yet, the direct-
ness of John Morrison’s has advantages
as well as disadvantages: when Mor-
rison makes an impact on the reader,
the contact is immediate and intimate.
“The Tins” by Peter Cowan is ex-
cellent; it skilfully works out its theme
of people ceasing to be involved with
each other and compensating by be-
coming obsessed with things in
this case tins. It reminds me of an
allegedly true story I once heard about
a man who rented several addresses
merely for the purpose of storing mint
rubbish, which included items such as
newspapers which had never been read
and mint bottle tops which had no
mark on them of ever having been
opened by a bottle opener.
“The Road to Madrid” is a very
funny and sharp story about children
playing mock battles, written by David
Forrest. “Preliminaries” by Laurence
Collinson is very amusing about a
pilled-up, deodorised, and liberated
young wife who treats her husband like
a piece of furniture while she troops
off to meet her lovers, for whom she
prepares herself by various chemical
preparations. “Spoe” by Hugh Storey
first appeared in “Honi Soit” and
strikes a similarly contemporary note.
Neither of these stories with their frank
acceptance of a break-down of sexual
mores could have appeared in an
anthology of Australian short stories
ten years ago.
E. M. Noblet in “The Crabs” power-
fully evokes a seamy hotel on the nor-
thern coast of Western Australia; this
story is only spoilt by its slightly melo-
dramatic ending. Don Campbell’s
“Only On Saturdays” deals with the
old traditional theme of a father and
son in the bush. It has some good pas-
sages, but tends to be a slightly bald
recitation of a succession of events.
Michael Wilding’s “Odor of Eucalyp-
tus” quietly sketches the relationship
of a young English migrant and a girl
who meet on the ship to Australia, and
their failure to get to grips with each
other when they arrive here. An an-
thology of many good things.

of the defeated, had fallen by then!).
In 1953 the men fighting for power
were Malenkov, Khrushchev, and
Beria could anyone, at the time,
regard them as anything but a gang
of cut-throats, suitable members for a
Politburo which, according to Khrush-
chev’s own boast, one fine day fell
upon one of its members (Beria),
dragged him out of the room and shot
him out of hand?
How had Nikita Sergeievich Khrush-
chev, grandson of a serf, son of a
landless worker-peasant travelling to
the Donetz coalfields in winter, risen
so high since the day he (belatedly)
joined the Communist Party in 1918?
Was it possible for anyone in the Soviet
Union to rise high between 1918 and
1953 except by climbing on to the
corpses of his colleagues?
In January, 1938, N. S. Khrushchev,
then 44 years old, was sent to Kiev to
replace the disgraced S. V. Kossior
(who was arrested a few months later)
as First Secretary of the Ukrainian
Communist Party. The men who had
presided over the Ukrainian version of
the Yagoda-Yezhov terror preceding
and accompanying the Great Purges
Kossior and Postychev were now its
victims. A new butcher was needed to
take their place. “I pledge myself,”
Khrushchev told an election meeting


in the Ukraine in May, 1938, “to spare
no efforts in seizing and annihilating
all agents of Fascism, Trotskyites,
Bukharinites, and all those despicable
bourgeois nationalists on our free
Ukrainian soil.” This was one of the
few pledges to be kept.
Butchers are not made overnight.
Khrushchev had gone through a period
of training. From 1932 to 1935,
Khrushchev, as deputy to his political
patron Lazar Kaganovich (whom
Khrushchev was to destroy in 1957),
had been Pharaoh of that monstrous
Byzantine extravagance built on slave
labor, the Moscow Underground. Here,
great columned halls lined with multi-
colored highly polished marbles and
porphyries were built by politically dis-
graced men driven beyond endurance,
and beyond all safety norms, on the
basis of a faint prospect that obedient
work might bring ultimate rehabili-
tation. The investment in the first sec-
tion of the Underground at a time
when Russians were close to starvation
was 500 million roubles; the total
investment in consumer goods for the
whole of the Soviet Union under the
first five-year plan had been 300 million
roubles a ybar. The stations on the first
and second section required 70,000
square metres of marble one and
a half times the amount used in all
the palaces of Tsarist Russia in the 50
years preceding 1917. Khrushchev was
rewarded in 1934 by becoming a mem-
ber of the Central Committee. A year
later, the NKVD went down into the
tunnels and shot scores of men who
thought they had found safety in the
anonymity of Metro laborers. Their
work was not needed.
Khrushchev had come to Moscow, as
Kaganovich’s protege, five years earlier,
in 1929, to a delicate assignment in the
Stalin Industrial Academy, where
Stalin’s own wife, the 32-year-old Nad-
ezhda Alliluleva, was a leading member
of the Party cell that was repeatedly
being purged for Bukharinist tendencies.
In November, 1929, Khrushchev, nomi-
nally a student at the Academy, was
elected a member of the cell; six
months later, the cell bureau was dis-
solved for anti-Stalin activities and re-
organised, with Nikita Sergeievich
Khrushchev as secretary. Khrushchev,
one surmised, must have had the deli-
cate task of reporting directly to Stalin
about the activities of Stalin’s wife; she
committed suicide some two years later
Nikita Khrushchev
in 1932. His work in the Academy done,
Khrushchev was thrown into Moscow
City politics, first as secretary of the
Baumann District Committee, then as
secretary of the Krasnopresnaya dis-
trict, then as second secretary of the
Moscow District Committee, respon-
sible directly to Kaganovich.
Moscow and Russia in the early 1930 s
were, of course, full of other ruthless
men on the move. The men then being
moved into high positions, as Mr.
Crankshaw writes, were those who for
two decades to come would dominate
the Soviet Union.
What, in this unrelenting and un-
principled struggle for power, enabled
Khrushchev to rise to the top? Mr.
Crankshaw sees the question as a com-
plex one and brings together, quite
brilliantly, a picture of the conditions
in which Khrushchev operated, of the
“accidents” that befell the more senior
men, because they were too close to
Stalin, and of Khrushchev’s own charac-
ter, a combination of recklessness and
ruthlessness, political imagination and
caution, all held together by a superb
sense of timing. The book is as much
superb biography and social history,
lightly written, as an essay in Krem-
linology.
Khrushchev’s career, then, is the
career of a party apparatchik whose
power base lay in the other apparat-
chik in the provinces, and who was at
one stage apparently used by Stalin to
stop Malenkov (the heir apparent) from
becoming too comfortable and secure.
Of the men at the top, Khrushchev was
the least educated and, in the usual
sense of the word, the least intelligent;
but he had formed the habit of
authority, he had daring and imagina-
tion, a sense of reality when it suited
him, and a superb common touch. He
was both a cynic and a genuine Russian
patriot: Mr. Crankshaw has little doubt
that Khrushchev, like many of his col-
leagues, suffered a genuine revulsion
from Stalin’s personal autocracy in the
horrible years just after the war, when
the sufferings imposed upon Russia by
the Germans once again seemed to fade
Loquat Tree
In the afternoon was loquat time.
We, as greedy as the silver-eyes,
would snatch at the yellow, tear-drop
globules,
making us web-fingered sticky.
Sometimes the cats were with us to play
a game
of their own austere making;
scooping at the water-polished, silky-oak-
like seeds,
big and brown and slippery when you
tried to hold them.
The powdered-eyeshadow-green birds
shared the tree;
they had the topmost branches
while we
had mostly the lower ones with grubs
white, busy, pin-head grubs,
which humped away in terror from our
white, young teeth
and left the glowing fruit entrails to
lodge beneath our
fingernails.
Child-like we would have gorged ourselves
till we drooped tear-shaped as the fruit,
till even the never-satisfied silver-eyes had
long gone.
But even loquats lose their charm when
darkness and mosquitoes close in.

into the background against the suffer-
ings Stalin was determined to reimpose
on Russia.
The time had come for a change.
Malenkov saw this as much as Khrush-
chev, even more clearly perhaps. But
one of the most instructive portions of
Mr. Crankshaw’s excellent biography
is his description of the power struggles
surrounding Khrushchev’s post-Stalin
rise to the top. The men in the Presi-
dium used policies to gain power more
often than they used power to promote
policies; just as Stalin had used suc-
cessive switches of policy in the 1920 s
to smash first the Left and then the
Right Opposition. But there is little
doubt, in retrospect, that Khrushchev
was the man to bring Russia to the
brink of a new era that he himself
could not fully envisage. He hall acted
decisively and boldly when others had
been afraid to act; with all his hare-
brained schemes and reckless adven-
tures he had secured peace and laid
the foundations of prosperity.

JUDAH WATEN in “Season of
Youth” turns from his usual
Melbourne-Jewish characters and
atmosphere to present a fictional auto-
biography of a young working-class
man whose ambition is to become a
writer. In “Shares In Murder,” his
provocative novel of detection which
never received its proper recognition,
he demonstrated that he can move very
confidently in settings other than those
provided by Melbourne Jewry.
The book’s worst fault is one which is
quite unexpectedly perpetrated by
Waten of all people if ever a book
appeared to be written to a formula,
“Sfeason of Youth” is that book. So
much of parental misunderstanding, so
much of brotherly rivalry, so much of
sex., a bit of Sydney to get away from
Melbourne, and a liberal dash of senti-
ment at the beginning, middle, and end.
Waten, though, is too good a novelist
to produce a boring work the people
are believable enough, some likable,
some hateful; but they all lack force
and a few have very little reason for
existing in the story.. The novel gives
an impression of having been run up
at speed. The style is sloppy (“as”
written as a conjunction and “get” in
its various verbal forms are over-used
and irritating). We are left to suppose
that the narrator achieved his ambi-
tion, but on the evidence here he, as a
writer, does not measure up to Judah
Waten’s bootlace.
“Once There Was a Bagman” is
genuine autobiography in which the
authentic Northern Territory life and
background of Ronan’s successful novels
is presented full, raw, exciting, but with
room for detail. It is an honest, un-
contrived and sometimes horrifying ac-
count, and more than a little depressing
because, despite a good seasoning of
sardonic humor, its true centre is sad.
This true centre is decline the de-
cline of an era and of a dream of
which Ronan’s father, the famous
cattleman, and his' partner Matt Wilson,
are personifications.
The line drawing decorating the
cover of “A Rambling Man” seems to
show an unaccountably pregnant young
fellow. I perused its four short stories
with attention and followed the hero,
an Australian travelling in various
countries, with interest. He angrily-
escaped from a Greek seaman who
made a homosexual pass at him; en-
joyed a most engaging French girl’s
bed; was bruised jumping from a mov-
ing train and narrowly escaped capture
by a sentry, and finally handled an
awkward situation in a Hong Kong
brothel rather deftly. Cowan’s style is
too scrappy and brief, but his future
(for he is a young writer) may well
be promising.
The back jacket of Jan Smith’s first
novel asks whether “a sexually sophisti-
cated novel about modern urban Aus-
tralia” existed before “An Ornament
of Grace.” It seemed a silly question
(for the list is long and includes so
many authors Christina Stead,
Jessica Anderson, Elizabeth Harrower,
Patrick White, even Len Lower, for
goodness’ sake to mention only a
few). Perhaps, I hoped, they mean by
“sophisticated” something as airy and
enchanting as Colette or a delightfully
naughty, silly, funny little book. They
don’t. Jan Smith writes well of a young
woman journalist who, with her chil-
dren, has left her husband and finds no
true substitute elsewhere, although, for
some months, her affair with a generous
(and somewhat long-suffering) Jewish
businessman seems satisfactory. Her
next novels will be worth watching.
“The Nature of Love” is the first
collection of Judith Wright’s short
stories, most of which first appeared in
THE BULLETIN. It is inevitable,
although not really fair, that one should
compare them with her poetry, and
by that very high standard the stories
suffer. Yet, in their own right, they are
mostly moving, perceptive, and, as one
would expect, beautifully described.
My own preference is for the tales
here in which Judith Wright explores
the subtle complications which arise
from situations or incidents that, in
themselves, are so undramatic as to be
scarcely noticeable.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Guns and Butter
PRESIDENT JOHNSON’S State of the Union message
had to be an announcement of a guns-and-butter policy.
But, with the Administration hard-pressed by public
opinion, it had to take a gamble. The gamble it took was
to make the program of Governmental activity much larger,
both on the domestic and defence fronts. It is finding a
lot more money both for Vietnam and for social welfare,
slum clearance, and other parts of the “Great Society”
program. Further big increases in spending on defence will,
it is hoped, consolidate the already strengthening military
situation in Vietnam and by 1968 bring the end of that war
at least in sight. At home the Administration is hoping that
it can banish some of the disappointment with the war on
poverty by allowing its scope to be broadened by giving its
generals more men and materials and allowing the overhead
cost of administrative experience already incurred to be
spread more widely.
There is, of course, a big political risk, because this new
program has required an unexpectedly large rise in taxation
six percent increase in income tax. This is not simply to
“find the money” for expanded public spending, for Ameri-
can economic policymakers are no longer naive pre-
Keynesians. It is just as much a product of the situation in
the U.S. economy generally.
When he stepped down in 1961, President Eisenhower left
the Democrats an enormously valuable heritage unem-
ployment of between eight and ten percent and an even
larger underutilisation of capacity. There was huge slack
to be taken up without making increases in output depen-
dent on any real sacrifices. So there were halcyon years,
four of them, in which by simple Keynesian pump-priming
the economy could surge ahead, public services could be
expanded, and taxes even cut year by year. It is worth
recalling the achievement. Real production rose in five
years by more than a third, unemployment was taken down
from over eight percent to little more than three percent.
But an end to these painless advances had to come and,
unfortunately for President Johnson, it came just at the
time when his general political stocks have fallen. Now that
the slack in the American economy has been taken up, its
growth must be restricted to the growth in underlying
capacity about four percent a year, according to Adminis-
tration estimates. Since Eisenhower went, of course, we have
grown used to U.S. growth closer to seven percent a year.
Last year was the first year in which a transition to the
lower rate was attempted. This was done mainly through
monetary policy interest rates went up steeply. The
result was that the restraint was concentrated almost entirely
on housing and business investment expenditures, which
have slumped sharply. Fortunately in a way for the Adminis-
tration, the controversy over car safety standards took a lot
of steam out of automobile sales, but under the unremitting
pressure of defence spending the economy as a whole con-
tinued to plough ahead. For the first time in a decade there
was pressure on labor costs and prices. Inflation, about which
Americans are more sensitive than most, threatened to
become an issue, and with defence still draining U.S. foreign
exchange reserves the Administration could not afford to be
complacent about a rise in costs.
This is the background to the announcement of a six
percent tax rise. It does not herald any serious downturn
in the American economy, only a slower rate of growth. For
Australia this may mean a further weakening of commodity
prices, and we will want as much as ever to get the
Americans to abandon their restrictions on our wool and
meat exports. Otherwise our interests are similar. Any
further deterioration in the U.S. balance of payments would
only mean that we would face cuts in the flow of foreign
investment, and an overstrained U.S. economy would raise
the cost of our defence hardware.
MEN AND MATTERS
IF S.A. Pnmier F. H. Walsh can
be placated, there’s a good chance
that within a month or so Esso-
BHP will have licences to proceed with
the exploitation of its oil and gas finds
in Bass Strait along the general lines
of Mr. Holt’s formula. After objecting
to the rules having been changed while
the off-shore oil search game was in
progress, the Esso Exploration man-
ager, Mr. J. H. Hamlin, has at least
won his major objective in the months-
long discussions with Governments
the retention of the whole of his
group’s discovery areas, even if the
price of paying an extra one percent
(making a total of 11) in royalties as
a quid pro quo seems pretty stiff.
Mr. Hamlin’s tall, commanding
presence has made an impressive mark
in oil search circles and on Govern-
ments since his translation here from
a variety of oil-search posts abroad,
including a long spell at the fabulous
Leduc field in Canada. A lot more
will be heard also of 46-year-old
geologist Mr. W. Murray Lonie, his
BHP partner in the group’s talks with
Governments.
Mr. Lonie heads BHP’s oil and gas
study group and was promoted to
manager class in the recent reorgani-
sation, which, in-
cidentally, entitles
him to a spot in
“Who’s Who.”
He’s been with
BHP since leav-
ing the Ballarat
School of Mines
in 1940. For the
past six years he
has been assistant
general manager
of raw materials
and exploration
at headquarters in
Melbourne and in BHP’s oil search
from the inception. Last year he was
chairman of the Melbourne branch of
the Australian Institute of Mining and
Metallurgy and has represented BHP
at numerous conferences and courses
overseas.
is a true-blue BHP promo-
tion, but in bringing in Daniel
George Moye, 47, from the Snowy
Mountains Authority as director of its
newly created exploration division,
BHP demonstrates (as it did in the
case of its director of research, Mr.
R. G. Ward) a flexible approach to
managerial appointments. Mr. Moye
W. M. Lonie
F. H. Walsh
J. H. Hamlin
will preside over the group’s search for
minerals generally on land, as distinct
from Lonie’s responsibilities for oil and
gas. Seventeen years with the SMA,
where he was in charge of its geologi-
cal work, a B.Sc. (Hons.) in geology at
Sydney University, and a spell working
with the N.S.W. State Geological Sur-
vey would seem to qualify him for his
appointment.
It is a matter of regret that the SMA
is shedding some of its key men and
that its highly experienced team cannot
be kept intact for new projects of simi-
lar national importance. But there can
be few better places for them to go
than where Moye is going.


Mrs. Jones Returns
THE bread spreads look like coming into the news again.
We have already had the dairy farmers’ representatives
putting in some punches at margarine, and there is lots
of talk of Marrickville Margarine recalling Mrs. Jones to
harangue the Agriculture Ministers before they meet as the
Australian Agricultural Council in the middle of next month.
There is expected to be strong pressure on them to raise
the level of quotas. Of course, this will come partly from
margarine companies like Marrickville, and through Liberal
Ministers who do not like the transgression of free enterprise
of such quotas to be too blatant. But also they must be
thinking that, in the longer term, there is potential electoral
unpopularity to be won by holding down the level of
quotas. For margarine is becoming more popular. Sales
are increasing, and quite soon there will be supply problems.
Margarine will increasingly become unavailable in the shops
and some sort of rationing w r ill develop. The fact that some
people believe there are health benefits to be gained from
eating margarine will add a sharp note to protests about
this unnecessary return to the conditions of the 19405.
It might be as well if larger considerations of this sort
were to dominate the discussion rather than the fate of one
company. Understandably, in its own publicity Marrickville
will stress the damage done to it as a company. While
sympathising with it in principle, it is difficult to find too
many tears for it in practice. The outcome of recent negoti-
ations with the N.S.W. Government is about as satisfactory
as it could possibly have expected. Having produced about
three times the legal quota for several years, it has incurred
a fine of only $4OO for five months without any licence at all,
it has produced at five times the quota rate, and now in the
remaining seven months of the financial year it is able to
produce the full year’s 2166 tons. It has certainly been
allowed to get away with a lot more than the rival companies
which abided by the law and resisted the temptation to take
the profits so obviously available beyond the quota.
If the N.S.W. Government has discriminated against any-
one, its victims have been Meggits, Vegetable, Unilever, and
other firms which have remained within the law.
Image of the Treasury
MR. JOHN STONE’S appointment as an executive
director of the World Bank and the IMF is an
interesting development. Stone, more than anyone,
has been responsible for improving the public image of the
Treasury following the 1961 recession, for which it was
blamed. Put in charge of a new “Surveys” section in the
elite general financial and economic policy branch in 1962,
he recruited a handful of the best brains in the Public
Service to work for him; he also created new precedents
by employing university and Reserve Bank officers on year-
long assignments.
Stone has constantly urged a more open approach by
the Treasury to discussion of policy issues and his section
was responsible for the drafts of the Treasury’s series of
pamphlets on the balance of payments, foreign investment,
growth, and the work-force projections. It also produced
the periodical statements with the Budget papers assessing
the economic implications of the Budget, and the August
and November consolidations of semi-Government and
State Government finances.
For Stone, who was one of a dozen of Treasury’s assistant
secretaries, the new appointment is a big promotion. He
takes the place of Maurice O’Donnell, who came back
from Washington to become Deputy Secretary of the
Treasury. So Stone is well in line for this position in 1971,
when the top two men are due to retire.
Treasury is keen to get Australia closer to the Group of
Ten and other informal associations of central bankers, who
these days make most of the important decisions affecting
international finance. The wise and gentlemanly old
O’Donnell has laid the diplomatic groundwork; it is now'
up to the younger, forceful Stone to bring things to fruition.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: Plenty of notice attached to
wool last week, culminating in what looked suspiciously
like a resurrection of reserve-price notions by Mr. B. L.
Killen and a batch of his followers at Moree (N.S.W.)
. . . The cheque for six months of the 1966-67 selling
season to December totalled $353.9m. dollars, against
1965-66’s corresponding $330.5m., with greasy averaging
49.18 cents a lb. (previous period 48.67 cents) . . .
Actual December sales dropped back $ 15.5 m. to $49.7m.
on smaller volume, the month’s greasy average being
48.16 cents . . . The week’s sales saw prices still going
in buyers’ favor.
The London “Financial Times” feels 1967 will be
especially “gloomy” for sugar; Friday’s free market
price touched down at £I2J a ton.
The Bureau of Agricultural Economics estimates Aus-
tralia’s farm income will gain some 10 percent in 1966-
67, bringing it a little higher than pre-drought, 1963-64
levels.
For the marhets: Second thoughts, and profit-
taking, took some of the forward drive away from Aus-
tralian share markets during the week. By Friday a
firmer tendency had returned, allowing many earlier-
affected metals and industrials to improve. Nevertheless,
these sections went lower overall. Gold issues are sought
in terms of possible overseas developments.
Bravely resisting poor December trade figures, falling
company earnings, a sad steel industry, and America’s
“State of the Union,” London crept up, but certainly
looked more mixed on Friday . . . Wall Street found
enough pressure for nine consecutive days of rising
dealings.
For companies: A new set of auditors are still
kept busy qualifying the latest (1965-66) accounts from
Savoy Corporation, mostly because some real estate
assets do not carry independent valuations; a loss of
$189,891 is indicated, compared with 1964-65’s
$2,300,798 loss. The company sounds hopeful about resi-
dential land prospects at Tullamarine, Melbourne . . .
Directors of retailer Cox Bros, are engaged in trying to
develop a reconstruction plan, while the receiver-manager
advertises for offers to buy the group’s shops; accumu-
lated losses went up from sB.9m. to $ 10.1 m. in the year
ended August 1.
Financiers Mercantile Credits and Custom Credit
Corporation have cut interest rates on their public bor-
rowings, Custom Credit actually replacing a still-current
prospectus . . . Melbourne’s Carlton and United Brew-
eries is soon to ask for slom. in debentures, “for ex-
pansion and to improve liquidity”; its Queensland sub-
sidiary, Queensland Brewery, earned less for the year to
June 30 last ($387,139 against $429,825) ... In Tas-
mania, Cascade Brewery earned “slightly more” to De-
cember, keeping a steady 4 percent on pre-bonus capital.
Pyrites proved the boon for Norseman Gold Mines:
better demand for sulphur lifted profit from $56,022 to
$72,351 and meant a 24 cent bonus addition to the
normal 5 cent a share dividend . . . Wittenoom pur-
chasers, Messrs. Hancock and Wright, are negotiating
with three oil companies in an effort to bring a refinery
to the Cape Lambert-Port Samson area .... Wapet’s
Dongara “appears to be an important natural gas field”
. . . Conzinc Riotinto’s Barrier operators, New Broken
Hill and Zinc Corporation, produced less lead and
silver during the December quarter; New B.H. gave
more zinc.
“Real progress in the rate of industrial growth” is
awaited by Commonwealth Industrial Gases; until this
eventuates its own capital expansion will remain “below
anticipated levels” . . . British Tobacco’s packager Dodge
Consolidated shows hieher sales and profits . . . The
AMP wrote record new business in 1966, at a slightly
faster rate than in 1965.

Gunn's Unenviable Ghost
By CROESUS
SHEEP have always grazed more
peacefully in Australian pastures
than, say, in the Soviet Union,
where wolves abound. So have our flock-
masters gone their own sweet way with-
out too much thought of beasts of prey
or economic doom, at least until one
of their number, Sir William Gunn,
donned a wolf mask.
Sir William carried all before him in
the industry until he overplayed his
hand. The rejection of his wool reserve
price scheme was a bitter setback to
his aspirations for himself and the in-
dustry. Since the referendum, he has
said and done little on the wool front.
Now he has found an apologist with a
more than useful pen, an Assyrian to
sweep down on the Australian wool
fold with a paperback carrying the
message that the industry is threatened
with extinction and that Gunn is the
only man who can save it.
The other side of Ronald Anderson’s
penny in “On the Sheep’s Back” (Sun
Books: $1.35) is a picture of the Aus-
tralian woolgrower as a dumb sort of
chap who can’t see beyond his nose
because he refused to be led up Gunn’s
garden path. One can only think that
Anderson has got a little too close to
the Wool Board and the International
Wool Secretariat, who are furious
they’ve not been given carte blanche
for their plans to rationalise the Aus-
tralian wool industry a la Gunn and
Vines.
The strange thing is that, although
Anderson says the rejection of the re-
serve price scheme was a disaster, he
refrains from expressing an opinion
about it. I’ve suspected all along the
scheme was merely a front for Gunn’s
unspoken design of virtual nationalis-
ation. If, as Anderson thinks, most Aus-
tralian woolgrowers are dismally ignor-
ant of the outworkings of their own
industry, they’ve been smart enough to
see that. And if they might expect to.
find in Anderson’s book anything to
convince them to change their minds
about reserve price they will be dis-
appointed, because the case for it is
not argued.
At one point, Anderson makes the
blunt assertion that “whatever one’s
personal opinion on the merits or de-
merits of the reserve price proposals
itself (it seems he has some doubts!),
the referendum by rejecting, in
effect, the leadership of Gunn and
Vines and their proposals for updating
the industry set wool back by more
than a decade.” This is a bit thick and
rather typical of the book’s many sweep-
ing and sometimes contradictory
generalisations. It certainly cannot be
taken as final in any assessment whether
the industry is going to meet all the
terrifying challenges the author poses
for it challenges ranging from the
costs-prices squeeze to the very sur-
vival of wool as a competitive fibre in a
world of synthetics.
frequently goes over-
board to rescue Gunn’s reputation,
but he also admits quite frankly that
his idol has made rather a mess of
things as chairman of the Wool Board
and has failed to rationalise the inter-
relations of the Wool Industry Confer-
ence and the Wool Board. As for the
institution of the Wool Industry Con-
ference, it has “barely got off the
ground.” His charges against the Con-
ference are particularly meaty. It lacks
recognition among growers, its mem-
bers are mostly “faceless men,” its busi-
ness is done largely by a small execu-
tive, and “as a whole it has been slow
to meet its responsibilities to the wool
industry and in some cases has failed
entirely to do so.”
Apparently dissatisfaction is so rife
at Gunn’s handling of the Wool Board
that Anderson can talk of internecine
power struggles racking Wool House
these past six or seven years, of execu-
tives tailoring their views to Gunn’s
likes and dislikes, of the chairman’s
favorites, of failure to decentralise and
so on. It must be pretty bad for one
senior board executive to say recently
(according to Anderson), “Without
Gunn the wool industry would still be
where it was in 1960 in a mess
... he is a remarkable man . . . even
a great one . . . but we wish he’d
been successful in getting into politics.”
What the Wool Board needs, says
the author, is a full-time chairman, as
for wheat and meat. Gunn’s inter-
mittent control of its day-to-day oper-
ations is unsatisfactory. Because he has
too many other irons in the fire, Gunn
would be unlikely to take it, so Ander-
son puts up the suggestion that Mr.
Vines be appointed executive director
ht $20,000 a year! I don’t think this
would be much good if, as is suggested
in the book, Vines coupled the job
with the IWS and spent only six months
of the year here. The suggestion seems
the more strange because what is lack-
ing, in Anderson’s view, is somebody
to take full-time control of the Board’s
day-to-day affairs and to develop a
direct and effective method of com-
municating with the woolgrowers who
provide the bulk of its funds.
A MUCH less controversial figure than
Gunn is now needed to run the
Wool Board. Sir William has been
nursing his reserve price hurts too long,
to the detriment of the Board. Virtu-
ally no progress has been made toward
other reforms which were not neces-
sarily dependent on the acceptance of
the reserve price scheme and which
Anderson outlines. Yet, if time is as
desperately short for wool’s salvation
as the author urgently suggests, why
hasn’t Gunn done something about
them? The short reason is that he’s
otherwise engaged, mainly in advising
Americans how to develop their vast
acreages in northern Queensland.
Anyway, I refuse to believe the right
man to do the job on a full-time basis
couldn’t be found without considering
the self-styled legendary figures of
Vines and Gunn. As I understand it,
Vines, who is 50, was discovered out-
side the wool industry by a PA firm.
Up to the time of his appointment in
1961 as managing director of the IWS,
his career was largely centred in the
paint industry and the Army. There
must be many a suitable candidate
around who has been a bit closer to
the wool industry than that!
The book was probably meant to be-
come a rallying point for the presently
dejected forces seeking drastic reform
and, above all, rationalisation in the
wool industry. They should certainly
take some comfort from it, but for my
money the case is overstated and too
scary. I much prefer the author in his
earlier chapters, where for the first
time to my knowledge all aspects of
the industry get a thorough going-over
by somebody who obviously knows his
subject inside out and writes jauntily.
It is written for popular consumption,
and every Australian should read it for
its lively account of our greatest
national industry and what the future
could have in store for it and us if
Anderson’s worst fears befall.

MAN ON THE LAND
A Blueprint from Monash
THE recent, extremely comprehen-
sive, survey of Australian agricul-
tural potential by a team headed
by Professor Fred Gruen, of Monash
University, is, to our mind, a blueprint
for American investment in Australian
primary industry. Yet it is doubtful if
Professor Gruen himself, the people
who helped him, or even the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture, which com-
missioned the project, are fully aware
of the full implications of tbe work
they have performed.
For most concerned it was, unques-
tionably, nice work. The two-year sur-
vey cost $36,000. The U.S. Department
of Agriculture got full value for
money, but then, we venture to suggest,
it was not really its money in the
first place. The Department normally
has no charter to investigate agriculture
in foreign countries in this manner.
However, along with every other
American branch of government, it
has, since World War 11, increasingly
entered into rapport with U.S. private
enterprise.
This is the Big Government-Big
Business phenomenon in the United
States which is only beginning to be
understood. To criticise it is to run
the risk of being branded a Goldwater-
ite, yet, in fact, Goldwater was the
first to speak out against it. His “ladies
of the night” speech (in which he al-
leged that big corporations were pre-
pared to sell their souls for Govern-
ment contracts) probably cost him
dearly.
Author Richard Barber, an employee
of the Senate sub-committee on anti-
trust and monopoly, and a sometime
Yale lecturer, was more specific in
economic terms. Barber wrote: “The
basic economic significance is that in
oligopolistic markets the big sellers
come to recognise that it is more
profitable not to compete in price . . .
co-ordinated pricing occurs regularly
in the highly concentrated industries
. . . for the foreseeable future the
American corporate giants will be able
to expand their position, at home and
abroad, with considerable freedom to
exert their power much as they wish
. . . without Government protection the
best the public can hope for is that big
business will be charitable.”
The Monash report on Australian
agricultural potential would appear to
encourage those large American food
and processing corporations interested
in wheat, beef, and veal, and margarine.
Production of these items is expected
to rise considerably by 1980. Surpris-
ingly, the projected increase for coarse
grains, barley, oats, sorghum, etc., is
not of the same order. It was this aspect
of the report particularly which puzzled
us from the outset.
All things being equal, one would
have felt safe in predicting quite
dramatic increases in coarse grains pro-
duction in Australia over the next
ten years. But, of course, all things are
not equal. World grain prices, and
movements, are controlled by the
United States. Power has its privileges.
The U.S. is the largest producer of
coarse grains in the world and the
difficulty in reaching agreement on a
world wheat price is magnified in the
case of coarse grains many times over.
The Monash report actually predicts
that Australia could be an importer of
coarse grain by 1970. In 1970, there-
fore, if we are still in this business, we
will look at the situation and remind
the authors of the Monash report of
their prediction. Yet the report’s view
that, by 1970, Australia could be im-
porting lamb may not be so far off
the mark.
LAMB producers are well aware of
problems facing this industry and
unfortunately the imponderables are
pretty imponderable. What happens to
wool in the next ten years must have
a tremendous bearing on fat lamb pro-
duction. Many properties, carrying wool
sheep now, could go over to increased
lamb raising if the markets were avail-
able. The lamb market is always tricky,
due to the quirk of human nature in
that some people like lamb and some
do not, but most people seem to like
beef. Most people in the trade (as dis-
tinct from the universities) seem to
believe that with the right approach
to pricing, packaging, and presentation,
lamb could make useful gains. Even
in Asian countries, where we were told
that people would never eat lamb,
resistances are being broken down.
Another Monash report item which
has already aroused considerable dis-
cussion is the prediction that egg
exports can double by 1980. At first
sight this looks a pretty wild guess, but
the egg industry, perhaps more than
any other, appears ripe for takeover by
mammoth American interests. The
CEMA plan, which was supposed to
keep small producers in business, in
reality is tailor-made for mammoth egg
factories. One decent sized American
egg giant could probably supply the
whole of Sydney and have a surplus
for export.
The Monash report is very juicy
when it deals with margarine. Butter
consumption will decline, it says,
whether or not margarine quotas are
liberalised. Dairy farmers will hardly
be ecstatic. According to Professor
Gruen and his team the best they can
hope for is a decline to 181 b. per head
per year by 1980, if quotas are retained.
If quotas are liberalised, we will be
eating only 121 b. per head. The report
does not say it, but the inference seems

to be that the quotas might just as well
be scrapped.
What the farmers will have to do
now is to get out a report to counter
the Monash one. Somehow we cannot
see them raising $36,000 to do it. They
just might, however, put in for a report
on how agricultural academics in the
universities spend their 40 hours a week.
This might provide some droll reading.
Bearing in mind that American Gov-
ernment policy and American business
policy, abroad, is one and the same,
it will be surprising if an American
food giant does not make a takeover
bid for one, or two, or more, Australian
margarine companies in the not too
distant future. It will not be surpris-
ing, either, if most people see it as a
good thing.
AGRISEARCH
Drought and Sheep Numbers
AUSTRALIA’S sheep flock could
regain its pre-drought size of 170
million by 1970, according to Mr.
J. N. Cumming of the Commonwealth
Bureau of Agricultural Economics. But
if the build-up follows the somewhat
slower average of the past three years,
he says it could take until 1972 to
recover fully.
At the end of March, 1966, the
national flock was nearly 14 million
fewer than at the same time in the
previous year. Actually, New South
Wales had lost almost 12 million sheep
in the drought and Queensland just
over 5| million. Being more or less un-
affected by the drought, the other
States continued to expand their flocks
at the normal rate. As a result the
heavy losses in New South Wales and
Queensland were partly offset.
Though Mr. Cumming’s calculations
of effects on the national front are
heartening, his figures tell a harsher
story for the two States hardest hit by
the drought. Implicitly, many individual
sheepmen are going to have a hard
struggle ahead of them in attempting to
regain former strength in flock numbers,
not to, mention flock quality.
Given good seasons and optimum
opportunity, New South Wales could
possibly make good in three years. Five
years, however, is the more likely mini-
mum period, but it could take eight
or even twelve years for this State to
reach its pre-drought sheep population
of about million.
Queensland’s plight is much worse.
Because lamb survival is so hazardous
there under the difficult climate, it
could be 25 years before the flocks
again equal their 1965 size. On the
records of the past, Mr. Cumming
considers that Queensland will prob-
ably take about 16 years to recover.
ffHESE estimates, it must be realised,
refer only to quantity, not quality.
Breed improvement programs will have
been set back considerably longer. The
Animal Genetics Section of the CSIRO,
for instance, has recently abandoned
the unequal struggle in Queensland. It
has finally given up its long-established
breeding research station of “Gilruth
Plains” at Cunnamulla in south-western
Queensland and moved the sheep to the
much better environment offered by the
tablelands near Armidale in New South
Wales. Here, it is hoped, breeding ex-
periments will be carried through to
fruition before their designers die of
old age.
Lamb survival more than anything
else determines the rate of increase in
sheep numbers, besides controlling the
flockmaster’s latitude in culling. The
lamb marking percentage, while vary-
ing very widely from property to prop-
erty, has fluctuated around 70 percent
as a national average. This is a de-
pressingly, even disgracefully, low
figure. Research has shown that, if
ewes are properly fed during the last
month or so of pregnancy and if the
lambs are given some protection from
cold wind during the first several hours
after birth, striking increases in lamb
survival are possible.
ir fHE scientific papers of Dr. G. Alex-
ander, CSIRO’s specialist on lamb
losses, make very interesting reading.
His experiments and experience may be
summed up thus: starvation is by far
the commonest cause of death among
young lambs. And he has found that
this state of affairs usually arises as
a result of mismothering on the part
of the ewe or a feeble response to the
ewe on the part of the lamb. Such
disturbed behaviour is consequent upon
poor pre-natal nutrition, which bad
weather at the time of lambing aggra-
vates.
Perhaps one of the more significant
of his recent findings is that a lamb’s
sucking drive is strongest immediately
after birth. However, this urge to suck
and seek the udder declines quite
rapidly unless the early attempts are
successful. For instance, he found that
lambs typically spend 30 percent of
the first two to three hours after birth
trying to suck. But during the twelfth
hour, if they have been unsuccessful in
the meantime because of mismothering
or the stresses of cold, they spend only
5 percent of their time trying to get
milk.
During these studies he also found
another curious fact: lambs that fail to
get milk in the first six or so hours
after birth grow less rapidly. Even
four months afterwards lambs that had
endured this experience in the first
few hours of their life weigh less than
their more fortunate flock mates. It
has been known, moreover, for some
time that the standard of nutrition dur-
ing the early months of a sheep’s life
has a lasting effect on its wool pro-
duction.

Digging up a Recovery
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By PELIAS
THERE is nothing subtle about re-
garding the agricultural equip-
ment makers as a good recovery
proposition in 1967; the stockmarket
has already begun marking their shares
up from last year’s drought-stricken low
points. But has this recovery gone far
enough? There is no doubt about the
scope for further recovery before shares
for all the listed agricultural equipment
makers get back to the levels of a few
years ago.
True, the capital structure of some
of them has changed considerably in
that period and the earnings of many
others have fallen enough during the
drought to alter their apparent worth.
But it seems reasonable to expect that
the high profits and good prospects
that prompted such investment interest
a few years ago will return even if
moderated a little by last year’s savage
reminder that drought can reappear at
any time, this year’s record wheat
planting will in itself create a real de-
mand for equipment which could well
hasten recovery in this industry, des-
pite the lack of funds of many farmers.
The extent of the gap between cur-
rent prices for agricultural implement
makers’ shares and the general levels
of a few years ago is still great despite
the recovery so far. Chamberlain shares
are now around 1.62, but a few years
ago they were 2.56; Connor Shea are
down from 1.39 to .91; Ptavid Shearer
at .82 are still well below their old 1.42;
John Shearer at 1.72 is well down from
2.50; Mobile Industrial Equipment is
only .60 compared with .99; Napier is
.41 against .59; its far more impressive
rival in the disc-making business, Ralph
McKay, is 1.48 against 2.20, and R. and
N. Statham is .77, or about half its old
price.
Not all of these stocks are guaranteed
to bound ahead this year, although one
Melbourne investment counsellor con-
siders they are worth buying right
across the board, as he believes that
their results in the current year, not-
withstanding the drought, are likely to
be at near-record • levels and with
every prospect of further sharp in-
creases to earnings in 1967-68 and

1968-69. Probably the pick of these,
however, could be limited to Chamber-
lain, the W.A.-based tractor company,
Ralph McKay, which has an agricul-
tural equipment subsidiary in S.A. as
well as its plough-disc operation in
Melbourne, and John Shearer, the S.A.
implement maker.
A growing body of opinion is point-
ing to Chamberlain Holdings as one of
the best of these. There appears to be
four reasons for the choice. First is
the removal of the profit limitation
clause from the Tractor Bounty Act,
and the bounty’s extension for another
five years. The bounty is dependent on
a certain percentage of Australian con-
tent; however, until recently, it was
withheld if the pre-tax return on funds
employed in the making and selling of
tractors exceeded 10 percent. This
clause, which has prevented Chamber-
lain from receiving any bounty over the
past three years, exists no longer.
Second is the brilliant way in which
the group weathered the disastrous
1965-66 year. Implement sales fell 31
percent and tractor sales by 6 percent.
Nevertheless, profits returned 29.7 per-
cent on capital inceased by the previous
Year’s three-for-five cash issue and divi-
dend was held at 12£ percent.
The third reason is good manage-
ment. The people who run Chamber-
lain are highly regarded throughout the
industry (not just because of the com-
pany’s excellent financial record).
Finally, the group has been expand-
ing this year. Staff numbers at the
Welshpool (W.A.) factory have been
increased by about 20 percent due to
rising demand, probably a lot of it
reflecting the nation’s record wheat
harvest. And in labor-hungry W.A.
Chamberlain are doing pioneering work
by employing women in the light
engineering side of their tractor and
farm implement making. For Cham-
berlain this will be a marginal saving.
But, more than the financial saving,
a considerable improvement is expected
in productivity. In the present labor
position, employing male process
workers the bottom of the
barrel.
At $1.62 and yielding 3.9 percent
from the dividend, the shares seem
sensible buying. Benefits of one kind or
another to shareholders seem well on
the cards some time this calendar year.
ALTHOUGH Clark Rubber Stores’
shares have climbed more than
10 cents in the past four weeks,
they still appear fair buying at 86
cents each. The group’s growth over
the past three years has been remark-
The Chartist says:
AMPOL EXPLORATION could prove very rewarding for short- to medium-
term holders. The long-term trend on the chart since 1960 shows rather
wide fluctuations in a broad primary trend channel at a basic rate of
approximately 10 percent appreciation per annum. The basic trend line was again
“tested” and confirmed recently at 94c; a short-term rise to about the $1.45-$1.50
level would be possible, where considerable resistance would be encountered from
the 1966 range of trading in that area. However, a further upward move to
between $2.45 and $2.50 is indicated by the base consolidation and this point
would be close to the return or upper line of the trend channel. Sales below 90c
would invalidate the above projections as this would represent a complete break
of the major primary trend. Last sale price on 13/1/67 $l.lO.

to more than $4.5 million.
The organisation of this expansion
has been well planned; it is not merely
expansion for its own sake. The
board’s moves have been formulated
on the basis that the existing ratio
of profits to turnover will be main-
tained. If this aim is being achieved,
the outlook for the current year is
fine sales were reported 35 percent
higher for the first four months.
So there seems little reason why
the 1966-67 result should not cover
the dividend requirement on increased
capital at least three times. This
warrants a market price for the shares
of at least $l. The dampener on the
price appears to be the rapid series
of issues made in the past 12 months,
mainly to finance the current expan-
sion. There has been a three-for-ten
par issue, a one-for-four par issue,
and a one-for-ten bonus. One could
not be blamed for thinking that the
next off-the-market capital gain for
shareholders is a long way off.
However, this will not necessarily
be the case. The wide cover for the
dividend and the existence of num-
erous further opportunities for new
stores indicate that issues to share-
holders are far from done with for
the present. If the current expansion
program is a success, directors will be
looking for more funds to continue
it into 1967-68. An added thought is
that the wide dividend cover makes
the shares an attractive proposition for
those seeking mainly income cur-
rent yield from the dividend is 5.8
percent.
THOSE who like a bit of a gamble
may find Great Eastern Brick
shares enticing at 68 cents. The
group makes clay bricks down at
Traralgon in Gippsland, Victoria. It
returned to the dividend lists in 1965-66
after a four-year absence. The main
reason for this unhappy period was a
chain of technical difficulties with the
clay brick kiln. This is now on an

efficient basis, and the achievement
enabled the company to earn 15.1 per-
cent on capital in 1965-66. Dividend
was 10 percent.
Because of the mounting demand for
clay bricks (it outstripped supply last
year), the directors are planning to
double capacity in the near future. Part
of the necessary finance will be raised
by a cash issue. Now that the kiln
problems have been ironed out, the
group’s long-term future seems fairly
well assured. Profits were higher in the
first three months of the current year,
reflecting the fact that the main outlet
for its products is in one of the fastest
developing areas of the State.
The company is rather small (1965-
66 profit was only $42,000) and
localised, so the shares are tightly held
and tend to rise or fall quite sub-
stantially on the market if any buying
or selling pressure develops. The
danger for the shares lies in the pos-
sibility that the group’s patchy past
record may return. However, if the
current year returns more on capital
than in 1965-66, this will add to gen-
eral confidence in the stock and, with
a dividend yield of 7.4 percent, con-
siderable buying pressure could develop.
There are signs of this already the
shares could be got for 60 cents at
the beginning of December. Asset back-
ing is 75 cents.
AT $l.Bl Brolite Industries’ shares
are at their lowest point for
more than a year. The prob-
lems of the paint industry may in-
duce shareholders to send them lower
over the next few weeks, but the point
must soon be reached where they will
be due for a recovery. Possibly, the
turning point will be around the $1.70
level representing the net tangible
asset backing on book values for each
50 cent share.
The main reason for the drift in
market price over past weeks appears
to have been the dip in earning rate
to below 30 percent in the year to
September 30 last. Although still pro-
viding a wide cover for the 16 percent
dividend, the return on capital was
the lowest for some time. In the three
previous years the return had varied
between 35 and 39 percent.
The earnings drop mainly reflected
lower activity in the automotive and
building industries on which Brolite
largely relies. Their recovery should
take earnings back to pre-1965-66
levels without much trouble. In the
meantime, shareholders can be com-
forted by an earning rate which is
relatively high despite its latest dip,
reserves which are twice the level of
paid capital, and a complete absence
of long-term loan commitments. These
factors alone make the shares a sound
investment and one which should make
fast capital gains once the inevitable
profit recovery sets in (as it may well
have already).

COMMODITIES
Tungsten Ores Move Up
SEVERAL factors have been push-
ing up tungsten ore prices for
some months, China’s internal
problems could prove the most im-
portant in the longer run. Prices began
to rise slowly about four months ago,
after some months at about 260/- stg.
a long ton unit a unit is one percent
'of metal in a ton of ore, or 22.41 b. of
*lOO percent grade ore. After levelling
fat 300/-, late in the year, a further rise
Started and the current quotes are near-
ing the peak of 370/- set earlier this
year.
The latest surge reflected a wave
of merchant buying which quickly
absorbed the material available. Not
only is the small free market very tight,
but long-term supplies are none too
liquid, with some producers being
forced to cut commitments.
A fire has seriously damaged the
SU.S.6 million scheelite mining opera-
tion of Canada Tungsten Mining Cor-
poration, near the town of Tungsten,
in northern Canada. Production will not
resume for several months capacity
of the plant was 4 million lbs. a year,
and this is an important loss at the
present stage.
Also helping prices have been rumors
that the General Services Administra-
tion would lift its selling price for
stockpile supplies of wolfram. The cur-
rent $U.5.43 a unit price puts a ceiling
on prices outside the U.S. at the level
when it becomes profitable to export
supplies bought from stockpiles. This
ceiling is now a dampener on European
markets and should become more im-
portant if prices rise any further
depending on how desperate traders are
for supplies.
Probably the main factor in the
merchant buying in December was
speculation on China’s position and
on Russian sales policy. Russian deliv-
eries to the West have declined in re-
cent years, to probably 2000 tons in
1966. China’s exports have also fallen,
but are still vital at a likely 6000 to
7000 tons this year.
The Christmas period also marked
what some observers see as a new
stage in China’s internal cultural re-
volution, when orders were given for
mines and factories to be swept by
“serious struggle.” These productive
areas had formerly been exempt from
disturbance. Such activities will un-
doubtedly cause some interruption to
supplies of many goods, including wol-
fram.
AT present zircon, the by-product
of rutile production, is largely
used in ceramics and as a re-
factory (lining for kilns and furnaces).
It has been said that in the not-too-
distant future such “waste” of the rare
mineral will be looked on with wonder.
Zirconium metal was isolated over
150 years ago, but has only found a
use recently. It has excellent resistance
to alkalis, acids, and other chemicals,
but is too costly for general use in
chemical plant.
As alloy, with copper or magnesium,
it is very strong. So far the main prac-
tical exploitation of zirconium’s pro-
perties has been in nuclear plant, where
it is valuable because of resistance to
absorption of neutrons.
Westinghouse Electric Corporation
of the U.S. is to construct an ingot
melting plant and ancillary tube mill
to produce zirconium alloy tubing as
the latest move in the metal’s growth.
The trend toward using zircon in its
metallic form will be boosted by the
spread of nuclear energy as a generator
of electrical power.
Prices Trend
Downward?
The
Economist
Forecast
for 1967
COPPER is again likely to be the
most volatile of the non-ferrous
metals. The Rhodesian crisis is
still packed with possible surprises for
Zambia’s production. A stoppage of coal
supplies? A power cut from the Kariba
dam? Either would have drastic effects.
Katanga’s contribution is also in jeop-
ardy at the moment. Furthermore, im-
portant wage negotiations are in the
pipeline. Talks are now going on at
Chile’s big Chuquicamata mine, and
others are scheduled at some of the
key United States mines. According to
form, a number of these negotiations
are bound to lead to strikes. There is
also a great deal of uncertainty on the
demand side, with the Vietnam war
the most significant factor (at present
nearly 25 percent of the United States’
production is appropriated by the gov-
ernment for military use). Peace would
bring prices down with a bang.
For zinc and lead the picture is bear-
ish. World supplies of both metals are
expected to increase substantially next
year: lead by 7 percent to. 3 million
tons and zinc by 8.5 percent to 3.7
million tons. But consumption is ex-
pected to fall further behind supply: up
by only 2 percent for lead and 5 per-
cent for zinc. So prices of both metals
should fall. Tin, however, should re-
main fairly steady: world production is
now catching up with consumption.
Should prices fall as a result, the Inter-
national Tin Agreement’s buffer stock
stands ready to support , the market at
£l2OO a ton. If unexpected disruptions
of supply occur on the other hand, the
United States will be selling from its
stockpile at prices above £1236 a ton,
fixing a fairly firm ceiling.
Of the foods, cocoa looks well set.
Estimates for this season’s crop,
although higher than last, still leave
supply short of consumption in 1967,
projected on the assumption that prices
remain at 1966 levels. In fact, prices
have already begun moving up as con-
firmation of the estimates have started
coming in from the world’s' principal
producers in West Africa. The level
of world stocks therefore will be the
chief determinant of cocoa prices in
1967. With world supplies greater than
a whole year’s crop, coffee prices will
depend on how strictly producers stick
to their quotas under the International
Coffee Agreement. For sugar there is
little cheer, after a year when prices
have hit one post-war low after the
other. Production is expected to be up
again in 1967, raising world stocks by
a further 2 million tons to 20 million
tons by the end of next September.
After this year’s record crop in
Canada, Russia, and Australia, world
wheat supplies should cover demand •
including India’s. So prices could re-
main steady or fall a little. The big
question here is the next crop.
Best speculative bet for 1967 is silver.
The United States Treasury reserves,
which are currently being used to keep
the price down, are running out fast.
At the present rate there is not quite
a year’s supply left. A price rise seems
inevitable.
In all, we guess that commodity
prices during 1967 will continue on the
downward trend which first asserted
itself at the end of 1964, broken only
by a temporary recovery lasting from
the end of 1965 to the middle of 1966.

MINING
Some Other Active Miners
MOST investors are probably aware
of the mining activities of such
large companies as BHP and
CSR. The announcements concerning
the huge Mount Newman iron ore de-
velopment and the Bass Strait oil and
gas deposits are fairly constant re-
minders of this. But without continu-
ing publicity, the activities of other
industrial companies which are active
miners can easily be forgotten. Leav-
ing aside the quarrying activities of
blue metal and concrete companies,
there are several industrial companies
which have an active mining section in
their business.
Bell Brothers Holdings Limited,
which came on to the public lists only
last year, has had mining leases in
Western Australia since 1948. The
mining of manganese at Peak Hill and
Pilbara has made an important contri-
bution to profits of the company and
has provided valuable taxation conces-
sions. The company’s business is based
on providing haulage services for the
cartage of gravel, limestone, phosphate
rock, timber, bauxite, iron ore, coal,
etc., and the company also provides
earthmoving services under contract.
These activities provided the ideal
background for the entry into open-cut
manganese mining and the company’s
activities in this venture have made
Western Australia the major Australian
producer of manganese ore in past
years.
McDonald Industries Limited is an-
other company in which earthmoving
and construction activities provided an
ideal background for an interest in
open-cut mining. This group had been
active in the construction of beef roads
and other projects in northern Queens-
land and in August, 1965, after two
years of negotiations, it announced that
it had acquired a 25 percent interest in
Frances Creek Iron Mining Corpora-
tion Pty. Ltd. (Duval Holdings Pty.
Ltd. hold the other 75 percent). Frances
Creek Iron Mining Corporation has a
contract to ship 3 million tons of iron
ore, worth $22 million, from the
Northern Territory to Japan over eight
years. Frances Creek is about 120
miles south-east of Darwin. Besides hav-
ing an equity in the venture, McDonald
Industries will also carry out the min-
ing and ore crushing on a contractual
basis and will also build the leading
plant at Darwin under contract to
the Commonwealth Government. Ship-
ments from this deposit will begin early
this year, and should be of substantial
benefit in the years to come.
In 1960 Consolidated Metal Products
Limited, in an effort to ensure sup-
plies of antimony, much of which at
that time came from Communist
China, acquired New England Anti-
mony Mines NL, which operates a
fairly small mine at Guyra, in New
South Wales. The mine is Australia’s
sole producer of this metal, and all
output is exported there is no local
smelter, and the company imports re-
fined metal from overseas. Substantial
reserves have been proved at the mine,
which is being further developed by
Consolidated Metal Products, and,
although the shortage of water last year
restricted production considerably, this
relatively small venture has quite good
prospects.
services also pro-
vided the background for the entry
of Thiess Holdings Limited into open-
cut coal mining at Blair Athol, in
Central Queensland, as long ago as
1946, when it began open-cut coal
mining under contract to the Coal
Commission. These contract services
were -subsequently extended to New
South Wales and Callide in Queens-
land. In 1960-61 the company acquired
its own coal deposits at Callide and
Kianga, both in Queensland, and
directed its activity toward obtaining
export contracts for the production
from these areas. Expectations at that
time were for the export of a million
tons in 1961 and 3,000,000 tons within
a few years. These expectations were
more than fulfilled, and in order to
develop the fields at Kianga and Moura
a joint company was set up consisting
of Thiess, Mitsui (the Japanese
buyers), and the Peabody Coal Com-
pany, the second largest company in
the U.S.A.
Thiess originally had a 50 percent
interest with Peabody, but by 1963 this
had been reduced to 22 percent by the
admission of Mitsui. Until recently,
contracts called for the export of about
2j million tons of coal per year, but
the group has just obtained further
contracts which will mean that from
1968 about million tons per year
will be required to meet contractual
commitments. Profits from this venture
will be considerable, as they could easily
exceed $1 per ton —of which Thiess’
share is 22 percent. In addition to
its equity interest, Thiess also receives
a royalty of 20 cents per ton on sales
over and above 600,000 tons per
annum. With the latest addition to
the contract, Thiess’ royalties after 1968
will amount to $780,000 per annum.
This joint venture is by no means
Thiess’ only mining interest. The com-
pany has for many years owned a coal-
mine at Callide and supplies coal to
Rockhampton Powerhouse and the
Queensland Railways from this mine
and since 1965 has been supplying the
Calcap Power Station under a 25-year
contract. In Western Australia Thiess
is maintaining a prospecting program,
and last year took out leases at Cool-
gardie of about 1800 acres, covering
lithium, nickel, copper, gold, and tin.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Both industrial and metals sections turned down over the
week, yet, after a principally midweek disturbance, they
appeared rather firmer at the close. Western Mining drew
some of the interest in golds and started to move up again;
profit-taking, however, forced a net 14-cent decline to $6.82.
B.H. South lost IS cents to finish at $3.12, while Mount Isa,
moving more evenly to $4.19, shed only one cent. King Island
Scheelite put on a hefty 32 cents, reaching $3.23. Prominent
retailers Myer and Grace Bros, eased by six and five cents
respectively. Howard Smith was pulled back 14 cents.

Chess Bulletin
ARTHUR POPE
ARTHUR POPE, Junior Cham-
pion of Western Australia,
last week was a key figure
in what must be regarded as one
of the most sensational finishes
in a chess tournament ever held
in Australia. Pope was declared
the winner of the Australian
Junior Championship by the
Director of Play after a tech-
nical breach of the rules by
Ralph Shaw, of Sydney, who
would undoubtedly have other-
wise tied for first place with
Pope.
Shaw placed an appeal before
the N.S.W.C.A. appeals com-
mittee, which, after hearing evi-
dence from all affected parties,
cancelled the D.O.P.’s ruling and
insisted on a course of action
which would almost certainly
result in a play-off between
these two lads. This second
ruling was not acceptable to
Pope and he indicated that he
would refer the matter to his
own State Association for further
advice.
Pope was born in Glasgow in
1950 and, although he learned
the rudiments of chess at the
age of nine, it was not until he
migrated to Perth in 1964 that he
took up the game seriously. In
that short time he has become
Junior Chess Champion of W.A.,
Divisional Chess Champion of
W.A., and City of Fremantle
Chess Champion.
One thing certain is that
should a play-off eventuate be-
tween Pope and Shaw, they will
be worthy opponents.
Here is how Pope handled his
first round opponent in the Aus-
tralian Junior.
White: A. Pope.
Black: A. Sauran.
Opening: Petrov’s Defence.
I. P-K4, P-K4; 2. N-KB3, N-KB3;
3. P-Q4, PxP; 4. P-K5, N-K5;
5. QxP, P-Q4; 6. PxPep, NxQP;
7. B-KB4, N-B3; 8. Q-Ql, B-N5.
Much safer for Black would
have been 8 . . . B-B4; 9. B-Q3,
BxB; 10. Qxß, B-K2.
9. B-K2, B-K2; 10. N-83, B-83.
This move allows White to
spring a surprise. Much better
was 10 . . . O-O.
11. N-Q5!
From here on Pope assumes a
control of the game that his
N.S.W. opponent cannot seem to
combat.
11 . . . BxNP.
Black could have tried 11 . . .
R-QBI but after 12. P-B3 his
position is, to say the least,
cramped.
12. R-QNI, B-QR 6.
The only move available. If
12 . . . B-B3 then 13. NxPch,
QxN; 14. BxN.
13. O-O, R-QNI?
Better was 13 . . . 0-0,
although it is doubtful if Black
could withstand the pressure for
long.
14. Q-Q3, B-QB4; 15. Q-83, BxN;
16. Bxß, B-Q5.
This allows White to effect a
very pretty finish.
17. NxPch!, QxN; 18. BxNch, Qxß;
19. Qxß, R-Ql; 20. QxNP, R-KB1;
21. Q-Ksch, K-Q2; 22. KR-Ql,
K-B2; 23. Q-Q7ch, Q-Q2; 24.
BxNch, Resigns.

SPECULATORS DIARY
One Eye on the Ultimate
THE performance of the Petroleum
Investment portfolio continues to
fascinate me. After a major re-
organisation last financial year, directed
by an outside investment consultant,
the asset backing of the shares still
managed to drop a further 10 percent
in the past six months.
Perhaps directors should have in-
cluded such a “doubtful” stock as
Hotel Australia to boost the perform-
ance of the portfolio. I only wish I had
the foresight to do just that in my own
portfolio. The signal to buy was when
it became known that N. B. Rydge was
adding to his own holding.
While Hotel Australia was bound-
ing up, my first purchase of the week,
Darrell Lea, could barely hold steady
in the market. Placed at 90 cents a few
months ago, the shares sold down to
83 cents shortly after listing. A little
buying interest brought them fairly
quickly up to 90 cents again, where
they have since remained. So until now
it has been a rather uninspiring per-
formance.
Fortunately, the ultimate value of a
share generally bears no relationship
to the day-to-day movements. Re-
member United Telecasters shares and
the buying fever in the early days of
their listed life.
Apart from selling appealing choco-
lates, Darrell Lea has also managed to
build up an impressive profits record.
Following a move to very much larger
manufacturing premises at Kogarah in
1963, profits doubled in 1965 and were
higher again in 1966.
JF profits follow the trend of sales,
earning rate in the current year will
be materially higher than the 25 per-
cent shown in 1966. Surely the share
price then deserves to be higher than
90 cents.
I went back to the mining market
for the other purchase of the week.
Uranium Consolidated must rate as
one of the leading speculations on the
market. I use the word speculation in
the sense that the unknown is weighed
much more heavily in the share price
than the known.
If bentonite contained in the lease
at Springsure, Queensland, proves to
be commercially suitable in the pelletis-
ing treatment of iron ore, then the
investment will prove very valuable,
not only as an independent going con-
cern but also as a possible takeover
prospect. CRA could do it by issuing
a measly 100,000 shares. On the other
hand, if the bentonite does not work
out, the past record of the company
(six losses in six years) is likely to
rear its ugly head. I bought 500 shares
at 52 cents.
A couple of good profits in Whale
Industries ($49) and Woodside ($35).
I’m afraid Woodside was a case of
cold feet!
