COTLAND’S TRAQUAIR HOUSE IS
STEEPED IN HISTORY
THE foundations of. historic Traquair House,
the oldest inhabited mansion house in
Scotland, have stood in the valley of the River
Tweed for ten centuries. Today it is the home
of Mr. F. J. Maxwell-Stuart and is open to visitors
at certain times. It stands among the woods,
flanked by the rolling hills and moorlands of the
Border country, one mile from Innerleithen.
On either side of the main gate stand two
great bears carved in stone —silent and forbidding
sentinels that look down upon the impressive
approach to the house, a long avenue lined with
fine old trees. Traquair is the house where time
stands still, for no man has walked along the
avenue since the Jacobite rising of 1745. In the
summer of that year the Earl of Traquair, having
entertained Prince Charles, bade him farewell and
locked the great gates, setting a curse upon any
man who opened them until a Stuart monarch
was restored to the throne of Britain. Since that
time the gates have remained locked, and the
house is approached by what is known as the
“temporary drive.”
The ageing walls of Traquair have sheltered
twentv--seven Scottish and English kings since the
time it consisted of a single tower, a favourite
residence of Alexander T (1107), David I, and
later, Robert the Bruce, when these monarchs
came to hunt in the nearby Ettrick Forest.
Many scenes of historical importance have been
witnessed at Traquair —the signing of a charter
by William the Lion that elevated the hamlet of
Glasgow to a Bishop’s Burgh; the rise and decline
of the fortunes of Charles, the first Earl of
Traquair, who became Lord High Treasurer of
Scotland, but died poverty-stricken in Edinburgh;
the political intrigues such as took place between
Maty Queen of Scots and Darnley, who stayed
there iwo nights in 1566.

A BILLY BOOK
More than one daily-press reviewer
of Farmer Whyte’s William Morris
Hughes: His Life and Times (Angus
and Robertson) has written that it will
probably not be the last biography of
its subject. It certainly is not a
definitive biography.
As a collector of any material he
could find in the press or in the heady
reminiscences of Billy himself, Whyte
has been sedulous and painstaking; but
he seems to accept too much at its
face-value as it comes.
As a journalistic continuity-piece the
book is useful, though at times it has
for the man-in-the-street an appearance
of being more deeply informed than
it is.
Where the author has relied on
Hughes’s own printed reminiscences he
is on quicksand, and obviously has not
the historical and geographical know-
ledge to pull himself out of trouble.
W. A. Holman once said to the
writer of this article: “Billy is a
magnificent raconteur; but his tales
bear the same relation to fact as beer
does to water.”
So the sketches which Whyte gives
of his hero’s early Australian adven-
tures, while highly entertaining, are apt
to be also startling to ancient survivors
from, say, the life of Western Queens-
land in the middle 1880’s. Whyte is, in
fact, moved to brigade the youthful
Billy with the pristine explorers who
“left their bones in the desert” and
the men and women who “followed
bravely in their tracks bringing flocks
and herds and carving out homes where
no white man ever trod before.” But
the picture of an adventuring “great
heart” is scarcely more convincing than
the portrait of Littleton Groom which
the author prints facing page 146 and
which bears an even stronger resem-
blance to Senator Findlay than it does
to Groom.
However, let us view that “great
heart,” W. M. Hughes, waltzing
Matilda in the year of grace 1884—in
truth it must have been later: —
W. M. Hughes, just turned twenty,
sets out alone from Adavale for
Brisbane, humping his bluey and
swinging his billycan, and whistling
blithely as he plunges into the bush
that is all unknown to him. There
are rough roads here and there, and
some bridle-tracks and sheep-pads,
but there are forests to get through
and mountains to cross which had
never known the foot of civilised
man.... He is trusting to luck —and
Providence. And as he marches on
he recites passages from Shakspeare
to the possums in the trees and the
scudding lizards, and for variation
he whistles some of the tunes he has
picked up in the shearing-sheds.
“With hardly enough in his tucker-
bag to keep body and soul together,”
as he strode along, he “feared most
an encounter with the blacks,” with
whom he had had some “rather
unpleasant experiences.” for they were
a “pretty wild lot in these parts,” it
seems, and he had “heard one horrible
story about a whole family being
massacred by them. However, his luck
stuck to him.”
Now and then he saw
parties of them showing up in the
distance, armed with spears and
wommeras [sic], but he managed to
evade them.
So is legend made; but it is a sad
fact that two-thirds of the “great
heart’s” journey lay along a railway
which was through to beyond Mitchell,
and the rest along a regular Cobb and
Co. route!
There were gno mountains untrod
by the foot of civilised man—unless
it be conceded that Queenslanders are
not civilised. There were no forests
closely grown enough to suffer damage
even by the passage of a herd of
mastodons. If the blacks were waving
“wommeras and spears” at the traveller
they were only anxious to sell them for
tobacco.
The same flamboyance is apt to
invest the stories of Hughes’s deeds
throughout his lifetime, as when Whyte
finds him emerging from the fracas
after the Warwick egg was thrown with
“bloody knuckles” —I can assure' him
as one who was there that the only
thing bloody about him was his
language.
Of the mainsprings of Hughes’s
career Whyte writes that with the
question of White Australia “begins
the rise of W. M. Hughes as one of
the most dynamic forces in the history
of the country.”
Actually, in that matter Hughes was
only riding the tide, and he shines
only dimly in the great debate on the
Immigration Bill of 1903 in which all
the lions of the day roared at their
best. His part is little remembered,
and was scarcely part of the basic
pattern of his political career, which
was built, in the main, round com-
pulsory military service.
From the time that he first raised
the matter in his speech of July 31,
1901 —not mentioned in Whyte’s book
—this was his mission, pursued some-
times in the face of bitter opposition
from colleagues like King O’Malley
until it led him to fame, and the Prime
Ministership. Thereafter his claim to
note, apart from his past, lay chiefly
in a picturesque manner which gained
him a reputation as the political
“card” of all time and the fact that
having been the agency which first
injected Socialism into the Nationalist
(Liberal) platform on any perceptible
scale, he remained a sort of man-in-
the-iron-mask, a prisoner of Liberals,
whom he yearned to leave for his old
pastures and whom he was able,
because of his prestige as an erratic
enfant terrible, to flout frequently with
impunity.
Whyte is not very clear-sighted
about the political Hughes, or about
his associations. He ignores altogether,
save for casual references of no real
import, the galaxy of war-time advisers
—men like Percy Deane, Hughes’s alter
ego, as important in his story as Harry
Hopkins was to Roosevelt —one who
provided him with most of his practical
day-to-day ideas and restrained his
wayward passions.
Furthermore, our author fails to
bring out clearly in the right places
Hughes’s constant affinity for Labor,
the attempts of the imp to get out of
the Nationalist bottle in the years
1918-23. during which he found it
impossible to abandon his delusion
that his breach with Labor was only
on an ephemeral issue and that when
the war was over he should be able to

ANEURIN AND BERT
ALTHOUGH the Eisenhower-
Macmillan Agreement was received
with satisfaction in both Britain and
America (and also in Australia), the
voices of at least two men who aspire
to be leaders of Commonwealth
countries were raised against it.
Aneurin Bevan, interviewed on his
arrival in New York for a three-weeks’
lecture-tour, said the agreement made
“no contribution to the easement of
the international situation,” and that
the two leaders had continued “the
polarisation of the Power-blocs as they
are, which means they are in a position
to slaughter each other.”
Examined dispassionately, this is not
so much an attack on the agreement as
an attempt to brush it aside as a thing
of little importance. And that is not
surprising. After all, Mr. Bevan is an
important figure in the political party
which hopes to dislodge Mr. Mac-
millan’s Conservatives at the next
election, in which event Nye himself
hopes to be Foreign Minister if he
can’t edge Gaitskell out of the top job.
At the time his American tour was
arranged there was not only the
Atlantic Ocean, but the Suez Canal
also, separating Eisenhower and Mac-
millan, and if must have been rather
galling to find them renewing their
war-time comradeship just as he
arrived in America.
The agreement could easily mean the
recasting of his whole lecture-plans.
Was it this that was rankling in N'ye’s
mind when he said, in reply to a
question about the removal of Marshal
Zhukov from his post of Defence
Minister, “I suspect that all generals
of the last war ought now to be
relieved”?
But in brushing aside the Eisenhower-
Macmillan Agreement as something of
little moment, Bevan did not discount
the importance of the Nato Pact, which
was reaffirmed in it. Reminded that
Secretary-General Spaak had proposed
a “summit” meeting of Nato to discuss
co-operation in scientific research, he
said he thought it would be a good
thing. He had always believed in Nato,
and “the West has a right to protect
itself by alliances, the same as the
Soviet.” The importance of this is the
implication that despite the attitude of
British Labor at the time of the Suez
crisis and despite its proclamation on
that occasion that “bipartisanship in
foreign policy is dead,” the Opposition
at Westminster is at one with tha
Government in believing that Nato is
vital to Britain’s security.
Unfortunately the same unanimity is
not apparent in Canberra in relation to
the Seato Pact, which was also
mentioned in the Washington talks as
one of the “collective defence arrange-
ments... .authorised by the Charter.”
Dr. Evatt’s condemnation of the
Eisenhower-Macmillan agreement goes
far beyond Bevan’s mild dismissal.
Nye said, in effect, that the agreement
got nowhere. Evatt described it as “a
step backward, not forward.”
What sort of nonsense is this? For
several years there has been a Red
Tape Curtain between the two great
English-speaking countries in the matter
of scientific research —a state of affairs
that has meant a duplication of effort
and unnecessary expense to them both.
On top of this, for the past twelve
months there has been distrust and
resentment as an aftermath of the Suez
affair.
If the agreement just reached means
a pooling of scientific brains and a
healing of the breach between the lead-
ing nations of the free world it may
well be that the Kremlin takes a dim
view of it. But it is incredible that a
politician in this country, which has
strong ties with both Britain and
America, should regret the move. The
two English-speaking nations agree to
co-operate in matters deemed essential
to their common safety —and Evatt
considers it a step backward! Is it
the co-operation he disapproves? Or
is it the reaffirmation of Nato’s decision
to stand by Turkey if attacked?
The fact that Dr. Evatt’s statement
was made at a meeting organised by
the “Australian Committee for Cypriot
Self-determination” suggests that this
may be the case. Evatt, whose intended
presence at the meeting had been
publicised in advance in the Communist
“Tribune,” told the meeting that the
U.K. Conservative Government’s policy
in Cyprus had cost thousands of British
and Cypriot lives. He was cheered
when he said he had met Archbishop
Makarios and had found him “an able,
frank and direct gentleman, wanting
peace, not war.”
As these are kinder words than Dr.
Evatt usually accords archbishops, the
Greek political priest must have made
a profound impression on him, but if
he thinks they provide the key to the
Cyprus problem he is being more naive
than when he asked Parliament to
accept as conclusive his famous
correspondence with Molotov.
It is quite easy to believe that Dr.
Evatt’s able, frank and direct gentle-
man wants peace, not war. As another
able gentleman, Khrushchev, said last
week, after he had been threatening
Turkey for a fortnight, “Let him be
damned who wants war. The one who
wants war, let him fight alone.”
An admirable sentiment! Even more
admirable was the Soviet leader’s state-
ment.that “If a decision is left to Russia
there would be no war for hundreds of
centuries.” Unfortunately, it comes
rather hollowly from the lips of a man
who in the past twelve months has
warned almost every country in
Western Europe of the horrors that will
befall them at Russia’s hands if war
should come. Only a year ago a
decision did lie with Russia—which
means with Khrushchev—and the
result was the Hungarian blood-bath.
To say that a man wants peace, not
war, means nothing. No national
leader wants war if he can achieve his
ends without it. Archbishop Makarios
is the leader of a movement which does
not shrink from murder and terrorism
to further its objective. Dr. Evatt
affirms that the A.L.P. and the British
Labor party are in favor of self-
determination for Cyprus. So is the
British Government. That principle
was agreed to years ago, and it was
Makarios’s Greek Cypriots who rejected
a new Constitution offered by the
Attlee Labor Government in 1948 by
walking out of the Consultative
Assembly because their full demands
could not be met.
By self - determination Makarios
means enosis, or union with Greece,
a course which is not acceptable to the
Turkish Cypriots who comprise at least
a fifth of the population. It is also
unacceptable to Turkey, both for racial
and strategic reasons (Cyprus is about
40 miles from Turkey, 70 miles from
Syria and 700 miles from Greece).
The Greek case was rejected by
U.N., and two years of terrorism
followed. Dr. Evatt lays all the blame
for bloodshed on the British Govern-
ment —his references to thousands of
lives is an exaggeration; the actual
casualties are numbered in hundreds—-
but the forces of his “able, frank and
direct gentleman,” who wants peace,
not war, were responsible for most of
them. And the majority of the victims
of Makarios’s terrorists have been not
British soldiers, nor British civilians,
nor Turkish Cypriots, but Greek
Cypriots “executed” as traitors to the
cause of enosis.
Why the Leader of the Federal
Opposition should go out of his way to
identify himself with such a movement
must puzzle even his own party.


“NOW, BULGANIN. LET'S DRINK TO ABSENT FRIENDS!"


PLAIN ENGLISH
Time Out of Joint
Most South Australians pride themselves
on the fact that their State is up-to-the-
minute, but Senator Laught frankly
admits that it is behind the times. He’s
quite specific about it, even to the point
of naming the time it’s behind —Australian
eastern time —and by how much —30
minutes.
In a general way South Australians have
always been aware that clocks in Mel-
bourne and Sydney are half-an-hour
ahead of Adelaide timepieces, but the
thought has never worried them over-
much. Most of them, it is understood,
have been under the impression that
South Australian time is the real time
and that the clocks in the eastern States
are half-an-hour fast—due, no doubt, to
some whim or fancy of the denizens of
those parts.
Apparently there’s much more to it
than that. Speaking in the Senate on
October 16, Senator Laught, after glanc-
ing at his watch, asked, “Why should it
at this moment be 8.37 p.m. in Victoria
and the Australian Capital Territory and
only 8.07 p.m. in South Australia and
the Northern Territory—a few miles to
the west?”
He told his fellow-Senators that the 30
minutes’ difference was having a deleteri-
ous effect on industrial costs and upon
communications between South Australia
and the eastern States. “At the present
time, as between South Australia and
the eastern States, there is always one
dead hour a day,” This is because it is
no use a businessman in Melbourne or
Sydney making a phone-call to Adelaide
before 9.30 a.m. A.E.T. or an Adelaide
man trying to raise Melbourne or Sydney
after 4.30 p.m. Adelaide time.
Broadcasts of orchestral concerts
which commence at 8 p.m. in the eastern
States must be received at 7.30 p.m. in
South Australia. Church broadcasts,
sporting broadcasts, broadcasts of the
Melbourne Cup and even Parliamentary
broadcasts present a problem, and the
A.B.C. is put to a lot of trouble with
landlines and recordings in trying to
overcome the disability.
Senator Laught suggests that South
Australia and the Northern Territory
should be brought into line with the
eastern States in the matter of time. He
recalls that when the present time-zones
were adopted 60 years ago South Aus-
tralia was to have been one hour behind
the eastern States, but the South Aus-
tralian Parliament of the day saw
economic difficulties in the proposal and
reduced the difference to half-an-hour.
The Senator “cannot see why half-
measures were indulged-in,” and thinks
it is high time his State went the whole
hog.
This seems to be a matter for the
South Australian Parliament, but Senator
Laught, in stating Adelaide’s disabilities,
may have overlooked one important
point.
That dead hour may not be as dead as
he thinks. “Old” Tom Playford was
Premier of South Australia when the
subject was first raised in 1892, and
“young” Tom Playford is Premier today.
It is possible he might not agree to the
change. Perhaps it is during that half-
hour each morning when the Premiers in
the eastern States think he’s asleep and the
half-hour each afternoon when they’ve
forgotten he’s awake that he puts over
the big deals that attract new industries
to South Australia.
The Benefactors
Down the centuries it has been the
practice for those of British derivation
who have made great fortunes in trade to
spend their later years acquiring from all
over the world works of art with which
they can enrich their countries and stimu-
late the imaginations of their people.
It is therefore a matter of much grati-
fication to Australians that Mr. Frank
Packer and the Messrs. Fairfax, having
achieved immense wealth by printing
humble day-to-day advertisements, full-
page and classified, of the banal needs of
the Sydney community, should range
abroad and, with that taste which might
be considered fabulous if there were not
so many previous examples of it, import,
one from England, one from America,
those gracious compendiums of literature
and art, “Weekend” and “Crowd.”
First Come, Best Paid
Ford has introduced, chiefly for the
workers at the company’s Geelong fac-
tory, a bonus scheme offering them 10
per cent, of their normal wages for punc-
tuality and attendance.
The recession—or, rather, the easing of
the great boom—in the motor-car
industry, has made all manufacturers
apprehensive about costs, and they will
all soon face stiffer competition from the
local products of the British Motor
Corporation.
It could hardly be claimed that the
Ford offer of incentive-pay to its workers
to begin on time and to come every day is
the cracking of the industrial whip or
sweating, but it was received by trade-
union leaders, including even the more
responsible section of the A.C.T.U., with
misgiving, despite repeated union claims
that they are just as interested in higher
productivity to raise the living-standards
as employers are.
Factory output in Australia has, of
course, risen spectacularly. It has in-
creased sevenfold between 1939 and 1955,
although not quite double the number of
people have been employed. Manage-
ments have contributed plant and equip-
ment in the country’s 52,000 factories
worth five times the 1939 figure.
Ford, which has been one of the fore-
most in the provision of the most efficient
equipment and plans to expand still
further, mildly suggests by this plan that
the benefits of increased productivity
should go to those who get to work on
time and stay away least.
The company will pay £250,000 to its
2850 manufacturing employees at Gee-
long and £90,000 for the year to others
on the payroll. It is a recognition that
its prosperity rests on the output per man
per year, and gives the real worker the
chance to share in it.
The Defence Forces
[l'roni Canberra]
The number of persons in Australia’s
defence forces this year is the lowest since
1952.
The Defence Minister, Sir Philip
Mcßride, has circulated among members
of Parliament figures showing that
defence authorities estimate this year
that the total strength of permanent and
citizen forces will be 123,645.
The total strength has been higher in
every year since 1952, when it was
113,011. However, in addition, at June
last there were 81,431 National Service
Reservists who had completed their
training obligation.
Including permanent and citizen forces,
the Navy has 18,113, the Army 88,800
and the Air Force 16,732.
Expenditure in the major categories
for maintenance during 1957-58 is esti-
mated at £136,599,000 of the total defence-
vote of £190,000,000.
Service pay and allowances will take
£48,042,000, civilian salaries and wages
£22,303,000, general expenses and ser-
vices £27,908,000, procurement of main-
tenance - equipment and stores
£26,735,000, repair and maintenance of
equipment £5,841,000, and maintenance
of buildings and works £5,770,000.
The Queen Mother's Visit
Officials of the Prime Minister’s
Department planning the visit to Aus-
tralia next February of the Queen
Mother expect many more headaches
before final details are announced.
Already they have been inundated with
requests from States which, the Queen
Mother will visit to allow her to see
certain places and meet certain people.
The Tasmanians have protested at being
the only State left out of things. Mayors
of the larger provincial cities are up in
arms that no provision has been made to
include their districts in the itinerary.
But the officials are adamant that the
visit, although extended by one week,
will be what the Queen Mother herself
requested—informal and not exhausting.
Prime Minister Menzies had already
stressed this to the planners long before
the officer-in-charge, Sir Allen Brown,
left for talks with the Queen Mother on
detail.
Most important official engagement of
the visit—the opening of the British
Empire Service League biennial con-
ference in Canberra —is being arranged
as the only occasion for ceremonial of
any sort.


Deserted Wives
ii rom Canberra]
The Department of Social Services is
becoming concerned at the number of
deserted wives receiving the widows’
pension.
The department’s latest report shows
that the trend continued throughout
1956-57, and was very pronounced in
Class A widows’ pensions. The percent-
age of deserted wives in this group is
now 35.3 per cent., and the trend is
clearly apparent from the figures for the
past 10 years.
In 1948 it was 19.5 per cent., 1949,
21.8 p.c., 1950, 24.0 p.c., 1951, 25.7 p.c.,
1952, 27.1 p.c., 1953, 28.8 p.c., 1954,
30.8 p.c., 1955, 32.2 p.c., 1956, 33.5 p.c.,
1957, 35.3 p.c.
The growth of. the problem is also
causing concern to many voluntary
agencies in the community.
Expenditure for the year to June 30
on all classes of pensions was
£8,862,402, an increase of £1,139,606 on
that for 1955-56. The increase was largely
due to the greater number of pensioners
and to the extra payments made for
children.
Class A widows at June 30 numbered
20,648 and Class B widows 24,269.
Widow-pensioners form 0.47 per cent,
of the total population.
Men on the Job
Excellent private reports of the vitality
of the lately appointed Aborigines’
Welfare Board are coming out of the
Government offices in Melbourne.
These are characteristic of the other
activities of the Chief Secretary’s Depart-
ment since Rylah assumed control, and
also of the work of his assistant, Murray
Porter, who is serving his first term in
Parliament as an Assistant Minister.
Porter is chairman of the board, which
includes housing, health and welfare
experts, and within six weeks 'of its
appointment it has cleaned-out the shock-
ing conditions at Mooroopna.
Here, on the Rodney Shire’s rubbish-
dump, in the most degrading conditions,
were living a settlement of blacks and
some whites who had nowhere else
to live ; and standard housing plans for
the area have left the drawing-boards of
the Housing Commission, which is
represented on the board.
Last week members of the board were
scheduled to visit north-west Victoria
and the Wimmera to see for themselves
the conditions in which the native
populations are living and to investigate
on the spot the best means of housing,
educating, employing and assimilating
Black Brother in the climate where he
lives.
Operation Leave-pass
At a luncheon-meeting in Sydney last
week organised by Col. Ted Milne and
attended by representative ex-Servicemen
of two World Wars a scheme was
launched to raise funds for a memorial
to William Morris Hughes, Australia’s
Prime Minister and statesman-extra-
ordinary in World War I.
This country already has one enduring
memorial to Billy Hughes—the Territory
of New Guinea, which he saved for
Australia at the Versailles Conference
when President Wilson was hell-bent for
giving the mandate to Japan. As one
speaker at the luncheon remarked, Aus-
tralians probahly have to thank Hughes’s
prescience and stubbornness on that
occasion for the fact that they were able
to fight the Pacific war outside their own
shores.
But if New Guinea is the Little
Digger’s real memorial, the one now
proposed is at least a worthy one, and
one of which Billy himself would have
warmly approved.
Since 1918 Furlough House, at Narra-
been Lakes, near Sydney, has provided
holiday accommodation for 34,000 people
—ex-Diggers, their wives and children. It
is now proposed to extend this work by
providing permanent homes for aged
Diggers and their wives. Land has been
bought adjoining the present site, and
the scheme envisages the erection of
cottages containing two, three or four
self-contained flats suitable for married
couples—ex-Servicemen and their wives
or ex-Servicewomen and their husbands.
At the moment the emphasis is on
cottages for aged couples; later on it
is planned to build cottages for aged
single or widowed ex-Servicewomen or
for aged widows of ex-Servicemen.
In linking their appeal with W. M.
Hughes, the trustees of Furlough House
have in mind his work for the Diggers,
his lasting interest in ex-Servicemen and,
in particular, his sponsorship of the
Repatriation Act, which as Minister for
Repatriation he steered through the
House and which has been the prop and
stay for ex-Servicemen of two World
Wars. Incidentally, Billy was present at
the opening of Furlough House in 1918.
To make the W. M. Hughes Memorial
Cottages a reality the
trustees are seeking
to raise £BO,OOO.
Their appeal is
addressed to every
Digger who ever had
a leave-pass —which
means every Digger.
The 1957 Leave
Pass, which bears the
signature of W. M.
Hughes, asks for
leave to be granted to
“an aged ex-Service-
man and his wife for
the balance of their
lifetime, to visit my
memorial cottages.”
Anyone wishing to
help make one of
these “Enduring
Leave Passes” pos-
sible should get in
touch with the
Sydney office of Fur-
lough House, 129
Pitt Street (phone

Riches from Strangers
Although there is some evidence of a
belated interest by Canberra in Australian
science and research, chiefly by the
peregrinations of official bodies around
the capitals, the exodus of the talented,
discouraged, underpaid and under-
equipped young scientists continues.
Chided by friendly organisations and
the press for accepting salaries that
waterside-workers would scorn, Mel-
bourne scientists have turned up compara-
tive figures and discovered that the
United States Government spends 11s.
a head a year on medical research alone,
and the Australian Governments rather
less than fivepence a head.
Moreover, United States industrial
undertakings devote an average of five
per cent, of their turnover to research,
and hardly any is undertaken in Australia
in basic research by commercial interests.
Public-company boards, except those of
our few industrial giants, are content to
be second in the field to their counterparts
in the U.K. or U.S.
This attitude partly explains the depar-
ture of Ross Adey, senior lecturer in
anatomy at Melbourne University, whose
work on brain-cells has been gratefully
noted abroad, to become Associate
Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at
the Californian University’s Medical
Centre.
The other part-explanation is that his
effective salary will be doubled, he will
have charge of four laboratories, and his
work will be part of a programme in
which £340,000 a year is spent on medical
research compared with £9500 annually
on anatomy research at Melbourne
University.
Dr. Adey’s youth, brilliance and pros-
pects fortified him, on leaving Melbourne,
to make no secret of the fact that his
acceptance of the Californian post was
a protest: a protest on behalf of the less-
fortunate —and, in many cases, of course,
less-gifted—scientists he leaves behind,
and a protest that shows where his heari
remains.
“My idea of foreign policy is to sell more oil to the
Yanks so’s We can buy more tanks from the Reds.”

“AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS”
TT was a Saturday night and my husband
-*• and I were just leaving for the pictures
when the telephone rang. Because of a
Confinement we were already late, so when
the caller requested Doctor’s attendance
to a man “who had a bullet-wound in his
leg” we decided the pictures would again
have to wait for another night.
At the home of the patient Dr.
entered the living-room, where all
the family had gathered by the
hearth, and looked around question-
ingly for the patient. “It’s Grandfather,”
one of the women explained. “We’ve been
trying to get him to see a doctor for years
—and tonight he agreed. An old wound
has been giving some trouble. He was
shot in the leg during the Boer War.” —
“Doctor’s Wife.”

“Oliver Filter”: Sydney “Sun” seems
awfully alarmed about the shortage of
scientists in Australia, but one of the
suggested remedies does seem to be
carrying things a little too far:
Increase greatly science teachers and
mistresses in schools.

“Chas. E. Rattles”: On the day my
wife said The Stars predicted that I was
due for a great surprise, I got a verdict
in the courts in a tenant-ejectment case.
I had lost the same case in the same
court previously, so it was a surprise. So
I have added “Your Stars” to my daily
newspaper-reading ; I went so far as to
buy an armful of papers of the same date
and check on the prospects of “Leos.”
Sydney’s “Sunday Telegraph,” ‘Truth”
and “Sun-Herald” all assured me
the present was a good time
for business, though the “Truth”
and “Sunday Mail” did urge a
measure of caution, the “Mail” going so
far as to tell me I was “passing through
an upsetting period.” The “Sunday
Telegraph” said my luck was in. This
was supported by the “Women’s
Weekly,” which went further, confid-
ing that “luck was in, provided I played
safe ; my lucky number was No. 8 ; my
lucky color in love was black.” Anyhow,
there was a bit of sense in the injunctions
of the “Telegraph” (Bris.) and the
“Courier-Mail,” the one exhorting me to
“make use of personal contacts to further
my interests” and the other “to avoid
unnecessary work.”

“Cinquanteneuvieme”: Beer-cans may
replace bottles in Victoria, where a com-
pany has been formed to make them.
What a difference this will make to our
way of life! The hottle-brawler will
become an antique antagonist—almost
an iconoclast. The Australian habit of
throwing empty bottles out of moving or
stationary windows anywhere on the
road or close verge will have no virtue,
as a can will simply squash up if run
over, and cause no damage. Marine-
dealers will go out of business and small
boys will be deprived of a steady source
of pocket-money. In many ways the can
as against the heavy bottle should be an
easy winner, but I’m not so sure how a
can in the hip-pocket will look.
“Narumee”: He was a tall, elderly
man, dark-suited, hatted, and bearing a
suitcase; he ran, smiling blissfully,
along our suburban street, now and again
leaping into the air with arm outstretched,
reminiscent of a Soames or a Helpmann,
never quite reaching the large, saffron-
yellow balloon that bobbed in front of
him. Housewifely heads shook and
tongues wagged at this apparent manifes-
tation of the evil influence of hotel
counter-lunching. Then, far behind, a
very small, scarlet-faced boy rounded a
corner, yelling he’d lost his beaut,
balloon ; he was soon ringed by clucking
females who were taken aback when the
man, still smiling, reappeared, having
captured his quarry; the small boy
happily silenced, the man proceeded to
display the wares in his suitcase to cus-
tomers who were usually behind doors.
Yes, he did a fair trade. And yes, he
was a New Australian.

“Roni”: The town wje lived in during
the war was one of those sleepy old places
where nothing much ever happened, and
even the invasion of American troops did
little to relieve the monotony. Therefore,
it was quite an event when, one swelter-
ing summer midnight, the town bakery
burnt down before a large, interested
audience hastily summoned from bed by
the fire-alarm ; and as it never rains but
it pours, there was old George, the care-
taker of the building opposite ours, stand-
ing at the door with all lights blazing,
wearing naught but a very short singlet,
and shouting “Where’s the fire?” the
while he vigorously scratched his bare
stomach.
“Where's the fire, Abdul?”
GOON!
"Internationally 1957 will be remembered as
the year of the first world-satellite, and in
Australia as the year when so many huge new
office-buildings were completed in capital

a city of banks ; apart from the two that
skirt the Yarra there are no fewer than 79
banks within the city. Hotels have
decreased to 85, six going from Bourke
Street alone in recent years. There have
been several instances where banks have
bought hotels, demolished them, and
erected new premises for themselves on
the key sites. Like the struggles of pre-
historic monsters, it is all very frightening,
and the most depressing instance we have
had for a long while of the survival of
the fittest.

“Swanee”: One must give full marks
to the Postal Department for its efforts

Urana ; that office plugged for Erina as
the likely spot; fortunately that village is

everybody: Council’s in-
surance company because
the boots have built-in steel

prise a good percentage of

council itself because it
makes up employees’ com-
pensation to full pay ; the

ness is brisk; and the

A single stamp (Id. “Post Office”

the most noticeable of all droppings with

ANSWER TO THE QUESTION—
Who Was Donald Dinnie?
<<-|-N one of his stories,” the
I question came, “Henry
JL Lawson speaks of a
character being ‘stronger
than Donald Dinnie/ Who was
Donald Dinnie?”
Evidently some Bulletin
reader who, on reading Henry,
wanted to know precisely what
his strong-man simile meant —
not an extraordinary query fo r
the Service Department, and in
it went, under the “Does Any-
body Know?” heading.
Does anybody know! At
one stage the Service-page
editor got to thinking, as he
tried to find his desk under the
response, that he and the
inquirer must have been the
only Bulletin readers who
didn’t know. There were
people coming in, phone-
calls, letters from all over. And
when, for instance, you get a
wild Irishman (or at any rate
a wild Irish pen-name) jumping
on you for not being acquainted
with the prowess of a Scot,
qualms of ignorance become
justified. Thus:
“Paddy Doyle” (Lismore,
N.S.W.): Who was Donald
Dinnie? Hoots mon! Do ye
nae ken the Chiel? He was
probably the most versatile
athlete ever produced by the
land of burgoo and bannocks.
The human equivalent of
equine Lough Neagh, his wins
in both sprint and distance
events were legion, many
scored when he was very aged
by athletic reckoning. He was
also a classy performer at
hurdles, high-jumps and High-
land-dancing. I can recollect
an illustrated magazine article
at the turn of the century
featuring Donal’, dapper,
moustached and kilted, with a
heap of trophies and a collec-
tion of medals that would have
made Goring cry his eyes out.
It has surprised me that no
enterprising distiller has
named a whisky from him who
matured so grandly while still
maintaining his kick.
Most of the accompanying
response agreed broadly with
“Paddy Doyle’s” vignette. It
ranged through the dogmatic,
the enthusiastic, the vague,
while the contributors ran from
athletics-fanciers and High-
land lads and lassies to a South
Australian member of Parlia-
ment and a retired Army
colonel in Queensland.
Here's a selection from what
they had to say:
“Sapper” (Noble Park,
Vic.): Donald Dinnie was a
famous Scottish wrestler of the
type of “Little Wolf.” He
came here in the ’eighties of the
last century. On his retirement
he kept the Croxton Hotel in
Preston, near Melbourne. He
was noted for always wearing
the kilt.
“ R h y n i e ” (Drummoyne,
N.S.W.): The Donald Dfnnie
of whom Henry Lawson spoke
was a Scottish professional
athlete and strong man. In
his youth he took part in run"
ning and jumping events, but
later confined himself to
hammer-throwing, caber-toss-
ing, ball-putting and wrestling
at the various Highland Games
which were held all over the
country during the summer
months. He was, so far as 1
can remember, still competing
when I was a small boy in
1885.
“Chas” (Mosman, N.S.W.):
Donald Dinnie was an all-
round professional Scottish
athlete and strong man who
came to these shores in
the late 1880's. As a boy I
used to hear him adversely
criticised on account of bad
sportsmanship so different
from old Prof. Miller and our
Snowy Baker, both liked
and admired by everyone.
“L.J.G.” (Brisbane) :
Donald Dinnie was a strong
man very well known about 70
years ago. He travelled giving
stage exhibitions of muscle-
development, weightlifting and
wrestling. He visited Gympie
(Q.) on more than one occa-
sion in the late 'eighties. (I have
a schoolboy memory of him
only. I have a faint idea he
came from overseas.)
“D.S.N.” (Broken Hill):
Donald Dinnie was the strong
man of my boyhood days in
the early 'nineties. In Aber-
deen Shire, where I was born
and reared, we had our amuse-
ment from travelling parties,
with all kinds of acts —in fact,
it was in this circuit that Harry
Lauder first made his appear-
ance, doing all the towns on
the east coast and along the
Murray Firth. Donald Dinnie
used to travel from town to
town giving exhibitions of
weightlifting, and we young-
sters would proudly flex the
muscles in our arms trying to
imitate oor Donal’. He was at
his best, 1 think, about 1890-
94.
“A. Reader” (North Curl
Curl, N.S.W.): In the mid-
’eighties Donald was well
known in Melbourne as a
champion weightlifter and
wrestler. He was very popular
and a great favorite with the
people of that time. (Our
family has been reading The
OOR DONAL’
(Illustrations in this article are
both from “Professor” Miller’s
book in the Mitchell Library,
and are reproduced by courtesy
of the Library Trustees.)
Bully since it first began,
being friends with Jack Archi-
bald in Warrnambool in 1878.)
“L. E. O. R” (La t robe,
Tas.): Donald Dinnie was a
Scotchman wearing Highland
dress, who visited this town
during the 1880’s giving
demonstrations of weight-
lifting, etc. I well remember
as a youth trying to lift from
the footpath one of his dumb-
bells, which was displayed out-
side his show at the local hall.
He was a tall, well-built man,
and had a good attendance at
his show.
“Mac” (Rockhampton, Q.):
Nearly 80 years ago, when a
schoolboy, I saw Donald
Dinnie, who was then the
champion athlete of Scotland
(and, I believe, the world)
performing at a sports-meeting
in the town of Nairn in the
North of Scotland. He won
throwing the hammer, putting
the stone, tossing the caber and
ail heavyweight items. My
mates and 1 were greatly
amused at him tossing off his
kilt when his turn came to
compete. He was then dressed
in a white skin-tight dress
down to his knees. What
amused us was how quickly
he got rid of his kilt and put
it on again just as smartly. I
think he must have been near
the end of his career when I
saw him, as he never visited
the north again.
“Pelm” (Beaumaris, Vic.):!
Donald Dinnie was a
champion wrestler (Northum-
berland style). According to
my late parent, Dinnie was
brought to Melbourne approxi-
mately at the end of last
century for contests with the
locals. It would not be safe to
show you the house he
(Donald) bought in Prahran,

The story has it that a local

POLITICAL POINTS
There is no reason to believe that the
dismissal of Marshal Zhukov is due to
his refusal to accept the command of the
first Soviet manned (or dogged) satellite.
In fact, there’s no reason to believe he
.was offered the command.

The protests raised by some N. S.
Wales Labor M.L.A.s against the Cahill
Government’s Cabinet luncheon for
Japanese Prime Minister Kishi are either
posturings to gain cheap popularity or a
sign of politcal immaturity. We have
signed a peace-treaty with Japan and we
have signed a trade-treaty with Japan.
Federal Ministers and members, including
the Prime Minister and some Labor
members, have visited Japan and have
been received courteously. The Japanese
Prime Minister is entitled to the same
courtesy here.
Premier Cahill rightly told the N. S.
Wales Assembly that this was not a matter
for personal feelings ; it was a question of
public duty. In international dealings
no one can demand liked, but
everyone is entitled to politeness.

Former U.S. President Truman has
given emphatic endorsement to the
Eisenhower-Macmillan agreement. Say-
ing that part of America’s difficulties in
foreign affairs is due to failure to under-
stand and co-operate with friends and
allies, he thinks “the time has come to
stop fooling ourselves that we know all
the answers or can for ever maintain a
monopoly of any scientific development.
Therefore, within reasonable safeguards,
our security would be served best by
co-operating in a two-way exchange of
information between the British and us.”

Because of the poor services on Mel-
bourne suburban lines, it sometimes takes
two hours to make a journey entailing a
simple connection, but Transport Minister
Warner says that more trains can’t be

staff on duty than there are passengers.
Logically, the solution is simple: keep
cutting down the services until there are
no passengers, and then there’ll be no

“Uramao”: The auguries are not good
for New Zealand Labor at this month’s
general election. The Nationalists have
taken the wind out of their sails by adopt-
ing measures they had set their hearts
on, such as the pay-as-you-earn system of
collecting income-tax. The Nationalist
Cabinet under Prime Minister Holyoake
is the youngest N.Z. has ever had, its
average age being 54. Labor is ageing,
its leader, Walter Nash, being 75,
and many of the men he’d be called on to
fashion a Cabinet from are old men. The
party’s ablest debater, A. H. Nordmeyr,
is just discharged from hospital after a
heart-attack. If he can’t throw himself
into the campaign with his usual vigor
his absence will be badly felt.
Queensland Cabinet last week approved
a draft agreement for the development
of the bauxite deposits of western Cape
York Peninsula. If the plan comes to
fruition it will mean the building by the
Consolidated Zinc group of a town, port
and treatment-works at Weipa, at a cost
of £5O million. The plant would reduce
the bauxite to alumina, which would be
shipped elsewhere for conversion to
aluminium, but C.Z. would be required
at the end of 20 years to erect a full
aluminium-smelter or surrender a large
slice of its mining-lease.
Even at the treatment-works stage it is
estimated the industry would be big
enough to support a town of 6000 people.
In addition the port would help to open-
up a part of Queensland which, although
it was the first to be discovered, is at
present the least developed.

“Collins Street”: It isn’t just another
example of Victorian Country-party

M.L.C. for Gippsland, A. K. Bradbury

(North-western) are non-smokers, non-*
drinkers and non-gamblers, and to them
the jackpot-tote represents An Extension

Although Russia’s second earthy
satellite, now dogging the footsteps of
Sputnik I through space, could hardly
be expected to create the sensation the
first one achieved, its reputed size is
rather a shock to the Western world.
U.S. scientists, basing their reckoning on
the 221 b. of their own yet-to-be-launched
moon, were astounded when told that
Sputnik I weighed 1841 b. They haven’t
found a word yet to describe the feelings
evoked by the second one’s size—
reported to be almost half a ton. Pro-
fessor Messel’s word is probably as good
as any—he admits to being “totally
flabbergasted.” And anyone or anything
that can flabbergast Messel has
performed a feat.

Protests against shipping an unfortunate
dog as passenger on the satellite are a

solve some of the cosmic-ray problems
differs from the use of sheep and Tattle
for food or of monkeys to produce Salk-
vaccine or of guinea-pigs and other
animals in scientific research only in
being new and bizarre. Of course, an
alternative would have been to send
Zhukov, but he might have turned sullen

Zhukov’s fall followed the pattern that
has become routine in Soviet Russia
when a former idol is toppled from his
pedestal. He confessed his sins and short-

inember of the Presidium....! consider
[the criticism] to be substantially correct and
look upon it as comradely party help to
me personally.
He continued that when he had previ-
ously been dismissed from the central
committee in Stalin’s time he did not
admit the correctness of the action, but
“now it is a different-matter. 1 recognise
my mistakes.... and I pledge my word to
the central committee that 1 shall elimin-

If the sacking of Zhukov is primarily
Khrushchev’s doing and amounts to
removing a dangerous rival, it is hard
to reconcile it with the dictator’s recent
overtures to send the Marshal to Wash-
ington as a special envoy on a mission
of “high trust and confidence.” It could
be that the initiative came from other
sources in the hierarchy, in which case
Khrushchev’s position may not be so
unassailable as Zhukov’s fall at first
suggested.

“Ex-ACT”: When a friend had his car
slightly damaged he told his garage he’d
pay for the repairs himself instead of
going through the tortuous ways of
insurance. Thereupon the garageman
said the bill would be a lot less, because
he always “popped it on” for insurance
repairs. Musing on the effects on in-
surance premiums of this perhaps wide-
spread practice, my friend read the sug-
gestion of Sydney M.L.A. Ken McCaw
that insurance companies should be able
to recover part of the damages awarded
against their clients in cases where driving
under the influence, or dangerous driving,
was proved. He also read the reply of
Transport Minister Enticknap that third-
party insurance protection might encou-
rage some irresponsible driving. For my-
self, it’s just reinforced my decision to
stick to taxis.

After 38 years selling Victoria to

more leisurely tour of Europe after the
Armistice. He joined the bureau when
he came back.
Much of his own travelling around

Gippsland from Bairnsdale to Omeo;
where, he says, they are long, long miles.

H. W. Weathersbee, who has recently
retired as chairman of Horlicks Pty., Ltd.,
was a Regular Army officer in War I, and
for some years after. Joining the parent-
company in 1928, as assistant saies-
manager, he quickly made his mark in
business, and a few years later became
managing-director. During War II he
filled the difficult position of Controller
of the Southern Board of Trade, as well
as handling a number of other jobs, rang-
ing from top ones with the Red Cross to
private in the Horlicks Home Guard.
Just before he left England to settle in
Australia he was active in about 37
organisations. He left the parent-company
in 1955, but earlier, in 1947, he had
recommended that Horlicks invest a large
amount of capital in N.S.W. This led
to the building of the new factory at
Bomaderry, in the Shoalhaven district,
which was opened in 1952. At a function
attended by the N.S.W. Premier and
leaders of industry, the retiring chairman
said that he stepped down feeling his con-
fidence in the future of Australia had
been justified. “I retire in the best finan-
cial year the company in Australia has
ever had, which gives me much satisfac-
tion. I know that my successor, Mr. J. S.
Haddin, will excel this result.”

“M.”: Celebrated his 85th birthday
last month, Dr. Ralph Vaughan Williams,
0.M., the Grand Old Man of musical
composition. Born in Wiltshire, England,
in 1872, Williams studied under a
number of famous names —Parratt, Parry,
Villiers Stanford, Max Bruch, Ravel —-
and has devoted the greater part of his
life to the creation of music. Whatever
posterity’s assessment of his work may
be, in his own day he is counted among
the important British composers of any
period—the others are Henry Purcell and
Edward Elgar. Oddly enough, he has
held few posts: he was organist for three
years at South Lambeth Church, an
extension lecturer for a time at Oxford,
and a teacher of composition for a
number of years at London’s Royal
College of Music.
His works, which include symphonies
(among the best-known are the “London,”
the “Pastoral” and the “Sea”), other
orchestral pieces, chamber music, choral
works and songs, have a distinctive
English flavor, largely due to his love of
indigenous song and the use he has made
of ancient (and almost forgotten) British
modes. His later works include the


remote “Antarctica” and the outsize
opera based on Bunyan’s Pilgrim's
Progress.
He is absolutely lacking in musical
snobbery (what other famous composer
would have written a major work for the
harmonica, as he did for Larry Adler?),
an unashamed democrat, and a lover of
folk music. A huge man, he always used
to take part in the English Folk Festivals
in the Royal Albert Hall —to see him lead
on the dancers in the Cornish Helston
Processional Dance was a sight to remem-
ber. Since its foundation he has been
president of the Unesco-sponsored Inter-
national Folk Music Council. Lovers of
English song owe him a great deal —
where will you find a song more satisfy-
ing, more saturated with English
atmosphere, than his setting of D. G.
Rossetti’s “Silent Noon”?

“Maitri”: Something “unique in the
annals of Australian optometry and prob-
ably elsewhere in the English-speaking
world,” according to the “Australasian
Journal of Optometry,” took place
recently at the N.S.W. University of
Technology when William George Kett,
for 45 >ears an optometrist in this
country, was awarded the degree of
Doctor of Science honoris causa.
Educated at Caulfield Grammar School, Mel-
bourne, rveil stalled as a med. student at Mel-
bourne University, but was oonged to give
up fiis meuicai studies after the aeath of his
lather, and turned to optomefiy instead. He
practised for some time in Sydney, then
jouineyed overseas for further study, first rn
London, where he gained his Fellowship of
the institute of Ophthalmic Opticians, and
then in France and Germany. Returning to
Sydney, he became a member of the Institute
or Optometrists and was appointed its Director
or Opiomemcal Education. In this capacity
he staited a two-year course, in optometry, which
betoie long he extended into a three-year course.
Lecturer and examiner lor this course, he also
examined for the N.Z. Institute of Opticians and
lor the N.Z. Government Board.
He was an ardent advocate of the legislation
which culminated in the N.S.W. Opticians Act
(1930), and was lor more than 20 years a
member of the board which, as a result, was
set up. Following the passing of the Act, the
N.S.W. Institute of Optometrists was merged
into the Sydney Technical College and KetT
was given the job of preparing the new four-
year course, as well as being lecturer and
examiner. For several yeafs he was president
of the Technical Educational Council, to which
he had been appointed by the N.S.W. Govern-
ment. When this council was abolished, he
was made a member of the Developmental
Council formed to establish the University of
Technology. Once the university was success-
fully launched, he was appointed to its council,
and became president of that institution's
library committee. He is a member of the
State Educational Council, and one of two
State representatives of the National University
Convocation at Canberra.
W. G. Kelt’s outstanding services to the
cause of optometry have brought him no fewer
than three national awards—honorary life-
memberships of the American Optometrical
Association, of the English Institute of
Ophthalmic Opticians and of the Australian
Optometrical Association. H- was for many
years president of the Wild Life Preservation
Society of Australia, is a director of Mark
Foy’s, a member of the Sydney Anglican Synod,
and a churchwarden at historic St. James.
This very notable Australian’s other interests
include a profound knowledge of the classics
and archaeology. His biography does not appear
in Who’s Who.

Quietly-spoken, 74-year-old George

Church of England Grammar School

Gordon Burnside, then under Arthur
Mason, who was at that time city
organist. A founder of the Musical
Association of N.S.W. (one of the aims
of the association is to get legislation
through to protect the interests of capable
music-teachers), Allman has been a dozen

Big Tom Cunningham, said to be the
world’s first camera-cop, has called it a
day after 30 years in the Vic. Police
Force, the last 11 armed with a camera.
He’s taken some 10,000 photographs of
erring motorists, has lost only one such
case in court (the exception was when a
magistrate considered that there was a
reasonable doubt whether the motorist
had been forced over the double line or
not). In the early days of his cam-
paign, he was clicking his shutter 25
times an hour. Five years later he was
down to 100 a day, but last Easter took
only 30 pictures—which seems to indicate
that Victorian motorists, if no more
virtuous than they used to be, are, any-
way, more wary. .Cunningham saw service
with the First A.I.F. in France and
Belgium (he was under age when he
enlisted), then transferred to ihe R.A.N.
In 1937 he went to England with the
Coronation contingent, and in War II got
his majority and became assistant
Provost Marshal of W.A. following ser-
vice in Palestine, Egypt, Libya, Greece,
Syria, Ceylon and New Guinea.

Somewhere along the way from becoming
the first Adamson scholar at Wesley
College up to his new appointment he has
lost, he claims, an inch! He was admitted
to practice in 1931 and worked at Leon-
gatha, in Gippsland, for 20 years until he
returned to Melbourne. Since then he
has concentrated chiefly on criminal
cases. He has a good delivery and an
impressive manner. He also has an air
of detachment and tranquillity that goes
well, or so they say, with a Crown Prose-
cutor. In the whodunits, of course, it is
described as cold aloofness.

Into the Silence:
In Sydney, at 68, Charles Maclurcan, a
pioneer of Australian radio. In 1911 he
established Australia’s first short-wave radio-
station. He was at one time a director of the
Wentworth Hotel.
In Melbourne, at 72, Major-General F. P.
Derham, who, as an artillery-commander in
War I, Won D.S.O. and Croix de Guerre, and
was mentioned in dispatches. He was senior
partner of the legal firm of Moule, Hamilton
and Derham.
In Brisbane, at 76, Dr. Valentine McDowall,
one of Queensland’s leading radiologists.
Served as a captain in War I, and was a
Wickham Terrace specialist until two years ago.
In Dublin, at 79, Lord Dunsany, Irish poet,
dramatist, novelist, big-game hunter, cricketer,
and Boer War and World War I soldier.


ABORIGINALITIES
THE natives of the upper Gama
River in the Delta Division of
Western Papua are a primitive lot, with
little surplus produce or goods for trade,
but they do a fine export business in
snake-skins, exchanged for the coastal
natives’ salt and steel goods. Snake-skins
(or lizard-skins) are used as the tympanum
stretched across and firmly cemented on
to one end of the native “gaba,” or tom-
tom. Unlike sea-snakes, the Gama fresh-
water snakes are non-venomous, with only
a gummy mouth. This is how the catching
is done: A line of mature girls kneel in
the swamp-water. When the snakes
attach themselves to their breasts, which
are about a foot below the surface, the
“It's not fit for a DOG to be out on a night like this!"
girls detach them and toss them to the
waiting men, who smoke-cure the skins.
Removing the skins does not kill the
snakes; thrown back into the swamp,
they grow new ones. In my several
excursions into this Gama and similar
regions I must say I never saw a dead
snake. The natives always had scores
of skins to barter ; rate of exchange, one
skin for one safety-razor blade.—“Sanasi.”
* * * •
“Manamoi”: The shearers, feeling like
a day off, put their heads together and
decided to vote “wet sheep.” They duly
shore two sheep each, took a vote and
informed the owner that his sheep had
been unanimously declared “wet.”
“But,” said the infuriated grazier, “how
could they be? There hasn’t been a drop
of rain for three months.” “No, but you
brought them across a creek on the way
to the shed, didn’t you?” “Yes, but
there’s been no water in it for weeks.”
“No water! Well, how were we to
know?”
# * * *
“Q. Ree” (Fiji): About 80 years ago
my neighbor’s father was bom in an
iron tank (brought to the plantation for
protection) during a raid. Now our
housegirls take our electric stoves, refri-
gerators, washing-machines, etc., for
granted. And what would his wild
ancestors have, said if they could have
seen our Fijian medical practitioner
attending our golf-club in formal dress?
“Warbler”: The sacred- or green-
kingfisher, now to be seen occasionally
round Sydney suburbs, has arrived from
winter quarters in the north for the
breeding-season. If you’re lucky, you may
even see the dapper little fellow with his
green plumage and long brown beak
about the city or parks. They nest in
tunnels excavated with beak and claws
in hollow, decayed trees, river-banks or
termites’-nests. Occasionally a pair will
select a staghorn for home, but when the
young are hatched these quarters are
rather cramped. In one such nest I saw
in the Botanical Gardens a few years ago
five young birds were so crowded that two
had to sit on the backs of their brethren.
There was constant scrimmaging to
occupy the more comfortable top
positions.
* * * *
“8.H.C.”: Did the A.B.C. news-reader
get the drovers and the driven mixed
when she quoted market prices for “foul-
mouthed wethers and foul-mouthed
ewe’s”?
* * * *
“Tauvy”: A lot of mice about, so I
set several traps and put them in odd
spots round the house. One I overlooked
for two days and when I went to it, it
contained what looked like a mouse's
skin, but was actually just enough tissue
to hold the fur together undisturbed. The
trapped mouse’s kind family and friends
had penetrated the hindquarters and
removed bones, flesh, everything except
fur. I always believed mice were canni-
bals, but what dainty cannibals!
* * * *
“Spin”: Here in W.A. the bobtailed
lizards are about again, raising the old
question that can’t be satisfactorily
answered ; what awakens them,
and other hibernating animals,
from their winter sleep? Return-
ing warmth plays a big part,
perhaps, but it may not be a
determining factor, any more
than it was just plain cold that
put them to sleep; in fact, the
reverse can apply, at least to
hibernating mammals they’ll
awaken if the temperature drops
to the point where they’d freeze
to death. Disturbance will
awaken most hibernators, some
more easily than others, and of
course potential disturbers would
be more numerous and more
active as the winter moderated ;
but they’d awaken without any
disturbance, too. The trigger is
more likely attached to some
internal characteristic and some
annual physiological change—
excessive fatness may be the
principal factor inducing sleep,
and the dissipation of that fat
may be responsible for the
awakening. In the case of the
bobtails there may be another
cause. They’re particularly fond
of strawberries, and I’ve noticed
those around my neck of the
woods always come to life in time to
beat me to the first of the fruits.
* * * *
“W.J.W.”: Who taught the first
kangaroo to box? Nobody—it’s a natural
trait. * A bailed-up ’roo naturally adopts
a boxing attitude, and a big bloke will
even punch at a dog while its murderous
hind-claw is coming up to swing down
in a belly-ripping drive; and fighting
males often stand up and spar, resting
back on the tail and waiting for a chance
to bring the hind-feet into play. There’s
a tendency to regard the ’roo’s fore-feet
as rather redundant appendages, but they


Gcov& " ,
r \ ho. i 3
QoTri W*V&/


have a variety of uses. They’re used to
convey food to the mouth and to grasp
dogs and hold them under water to
drown; and ’roos have been seen to
catch fish with them. That requires con-
siderable dexterity and indicates that
those limbs aren’t becoming atrophied.
The boxing kangaroos which have been
exhibited have probably taught their
tutors more than they’ve learnt themselves.
* * * *
“J. A.S.”: Those “triple-barrelled guns,”
correctly known as “drillings” (from the
German Drillinge, meaning triplet),
mentioned by sundry Aboites, are still
obtainable in most countries. And not
only triplets, but over/under “combina-
tions” in 12-, 16- or 20-gauge over and
.22 Hornet or .22 rimfire to .30/06
Springfield (U.S. Government) under,
built by A.F.S. Ferlach of the Carinthian
town of Ferlach, Austria. This associa-
tion of gunsmiths also produces an
“Bimbo, YOU’LL never make an artist !”
0./u. job with a shotgun on top, a (say)
7mm. Mauser underneath and a .22
Hornet outrigged on the right-hand side.
Further, a two-rifle, one-shotgun set-up
that appears to be two .375 H. and H.
Magnums over a 10-bore —what a
cannon! —and a four- barrel 12-gauge x
.22 rim. x Bmm. Mauser —a veritable
mobile arsenal known as the Model 300
which retails in the U.S. at $BBO, or near
enough to £450. J. P. Sauer and Sohn
make a drilling of 16-gauge x 16-gauge x
8 x 57mm. Mauser (the ex-German
Service-cartridge) and are now produc-
ing it in American rifle-calibres. _ And
Krieghoff, formerly of Suhl but now
removed to West Germany, produces a
very fine drilling with everything on it
but wheels, which it doesn’t need,
weighing only 6ylb.
“Wandana”: Re the term “nailrod”
for tobacco (B. 11/9/’57), I recall its
frequent application in my boyhood days
in the latter part of last century. It has
always been associated in my mind with
the heavy square-shaped wooden cases of
tobacco pressed into black twists: the
top of the case carried a highly-colored
picture, usually portraying an American
scene with negroes, ships and so on. For
“negro-twist” the price was a shilling or
15 pence for a quarter of a pound, or
3s. 6d. a pound, and it was very generally
smoked until Havelock, Derby and other
brands of plug tobacco supplanted it.
* * * #
“Fair Mac”: A kick from the cocky’s
mare injured the pup’s near hind-leg. We
couldn’t find any broken bone, but a
month later he still wouldn’t put his paw
to the ground. When the doctor came to
attend the boss’s missus we asked him to
look at the pup. He confirmed that
nothing had been broken, but opined that
the muscles had been so badly bruised
that the pup had been forced to adopt
the three-legged gait; associating the
putting of the leg to the ground with
acute pain, he now wouldn’t try it;
should that persist, he’d eventually lose
the use of the leg. The boss tried
weighing-down the paw with a band of
lead, but it didn’t work. Then the wood-
and-water joey took a hand. He ban-
daged the good hind-foot with sticking-
plaster, explaining: “When a dorg walks,
his paws spread ; that bandage ain’t
tight—till he puts his foot down, then
it’ll feel like a tight boot on a corn. It’ll
make him use the other foot.” It did.
* * * *
“S.S.”: Three brothers were hunting in
the Adelaide Hills when their terrier
chased a rabbit into a drive of an old
silvermine. One youth put his shotgun
against the bank to dig out the burrow.
The terrier kept impeding his efforts by
joining in the operation, and, losing
patience, the rabbiter tossed the dog over
his shoulder. It landed on the gun, which
went off, killing the youth —another long-
odds one in the list of queer deaths by
misadventure.

WALKER’S lucerne-paddock is a pic-
ture this afternoon. The low sun
sparkles on the crop, wet from irrigation-
sprays, and fires the brick-red bank that
rises steeply across the river to sweep
up to the little hill beyond. The dozen or
so pulsing monsoon-sprays have just
settled down to the drenching of a new
strip, and on the sodden belt are the
experts that remove all pests washed-up,
or fossick for them while the digging is
soft. Today’s team comprises 13 blue
herons, 27 ibis and 43 spurwing plover.
The herons and ibis don’t mind getting
muddy feet, though they like to keep their
plumes dry, while the plover don’t object
to being splashed a bit.
The diet of the trinity is just about
anything that hops or wriggles, but
their behavior varies as much as their
dress. The ibis are stately and confident;
the herons daintier, but more wary;
amongst the plover there are signs of the
stirring of interests beyond mere feed-
ing. There was a whisper of spring in
the air today, and snowy breasts are
pouting, yellow wattles quivering and
stiff flight-feathers lowering as the cock-
birds strut their overtures. That flock
will break up soon.
It would be hard to assess the cash-
value of those birds to old man Walker;
but he takes no more interest in them than
do his massive Friesians, now straggling
back from the bails.
WIPPEGONG.
THE STOCKYARD POOL
The trout are big in the Currango,
But bigger to me by far
Are the trout that lie in the still, deep
pools,
Down in the Tantangarra.
The fish fight well in the Eucumbene,
Or the Three Mile Dam after dark ;
But give me the fish in the Bullock Head
creek,
Near the fossicker’s hut of bark.
And down by the stockyards there’s a
pool
Where two monsters met their fate,
One of them weighed eleven pounds
And the other one weighed eight.
They played these fish for hours on end,
Two men, who remember yet
How they landed them on the grassy
bank
Without aid of gaff or net.
So if ever you’re up around the Point
You’ll hear this story told;
And if ever you find the stockyard pool
You’ve found your pot of gold.

TjyE reared on the bottle a joey
wallaby whose mother had been
shot; it grew up into a lovable pet, but
when half-grown became partly blind
and remained so afflicted all its life.
Recently I saw another poddied wallaby ;
its mother had been struck by a car and
killed. The motorist accepted his
responsibility, and went about his foster-
parenthood in a scientific way by getting
zoological advice as to feed and suckling.
The diet was faithfully administered,
complete with the recommended
vitamin-C to ensure that the animal’s
sight would be normal. The youngster
is now a little over 12 months old, but
its sight in daylight is about on a par
with a human’s at night. Apparently
only natural food and conditions can
supply what is required to endow a young
wallaby with normal sight.—“ Sack.”

“Orang Puteh”: Regarding headgear in
the tropics (“Abi Tonus,” B. 16/10/’57),
Malaya can give Port Moresby a start
and a beating. Singapore is only 30 miles
north of the Equator, yet it would be
difficult to find a white resident (unless a
visitor) wearing a hat of any description ;
and anywhere north of that, to Penang
and beyond, it's the same. Before the
last war the wearing of pith helmets was
almost universal ; now they're museum-
pieces. It was the prisoners-of-war, Aus-
tralian and others, who scotched the idea
that headgear and shirts were a necessity
in the tropics. The shirts came back, but
not the hats.
* * * *
“Liewahlo”: In drought - stricken
southern Queensland the sun sets these
evenings as a blood-red ball —effects of
dust, haze and bushfire-smoke. Queerest
setting yet was witnessed at Mary-
borough. At dipping-time a cloud caught
old Sol, swathed him in black and then
divided into four distinct bands narrowing
towards the top. There on the western
horizon sat for a full minute or more an
enormous scarlet-and-ebony Chinese
lantern.
* * * *
“Spin”: The triggerplants are flower-
ing on the damp ground just up from the
swamp, and I couldn’t resist the urge to
trip the triggers on some of them. There
are three species blooming in this area
now, two with triggers which swing
straight over and down, one which has
a sideways sweep ; but they all have this
in common—when an insect comes to sip
their nectar, and lands on the right spot,
that trigger strikes and dusts the insect’s
body with pollen. Don’t think anyone
has worked out what activates that
trigger, and you can sometimes experi-
ment with a dozen flowers before you’ll
get a trigger to trip; apparently the
mechanism comes into action only when
the right spot on the flower is touched,
which means the insect visitors must all
alight in the same way or take the same
stance when sipping. This suggests that
each species of triggerplant has evolved
a scent or nectar attractive to only
certain insects, and that the blooms are
so designed that those insects are forced
or urged into a set stance.
WHEN I opened the backdoor to let
m Otto von Snigglefritz, that usually
bounding - with - vitality dachshund,
instead of cavorting joyously around
before settling down to the more serious
business of masticating my trouser-cuff,
staggered in like a rheumatic ancient of
about 16 and cast himself dolefully on
his side with a sigh like that of a forlorn
“ Shut-up, you! Remember , the customer is always right”
.lover. Blind Freddie could have seen
that he was blown up to about twice his
normal size.
“It looks as if he’s been poisoned!”
exclaimed the wife. “Don’t you think
we should run him up to the vet.?”
But the sable end of Otto’s elongated
conk \yas icy-cold and wet, consistent
with his usual state of rude health. More-
over, he wasn’t frothing at the mouth. It
didn’t seem to me, at that stage, to call
for the services of one who charges more
for a brief consultation with a tyke than
my doc. does for a long one with me. So
I prescribed a lubricant, thinking perhaps
that it was merely a case of his works
having temporarily seized-up.
Next morning Otto had subsided
slightly. Then the second mystery came
up: there, on the back lawn, was a
u.nVpno inn.Pt!
f , , ' , ' TT , ...
Me don t keep fowls. How, then, did
the goog get there? At fivepence a go
people don’t sling hen-fruit around other
people’s lawns haphazardly. It was all
verv nuzzlimr
J,, _ ,
That afternoon, while forking around
the young tomato-plants, I speared a
chooks head complete with comb, and
a lew feet further along dug up a claw.
Thus the full measure of Otto’s perfidy
was revealed, and the explanation of his
painful perambulation became apparent.
One of next-door’s fowls had flown over
our fence a day or so before and I had
rescued it, adjuring the owner to clip its
wing. Obviously he had failed to do so,
thus giving my Teutonic canine mate a
cheap poultry dinner, self-delivered, on
the hoof.
I haven’t sighted a feather since, so I
must presume that Otto, though an aristo
by lineage, is at heart really a plebeian,
for he vulgarly bolted his poultry feathers
and all. Apparently Nature has vouch-
safed him intestines strong enough to
withstand their being pierced by sharp
quill-ends. However, to look at it from
the Von’s point of view, feathers stick
somewhere in a fowl, therefore they must
be impregnated with the taste of
fowlflesh.
There remain but a few questions yet
to be resolved: («) Is it possible for a
chook to lay an egg, and that without
busting it, while sprinting at top speed
from a death-dealing pursuer? (b) If
the goog on the lawn was the by-product,
as it were, of Otto’s feathered feed, why
didn’t dogdom’s champion gourmand
polish it off as a dessert? (c) What sort
of debilitated fowls do they breed these
days that can’t outpace, let alone outfly,
the most unathletically proportioned of
the world’s pooches?
I may add that since he made the only
catch he is ever likely to make in his life-
time, whenever a hen cackles after
performing her matutinal duty Otto von
Snigglefritz bends upon me a reproachful
look which clearly says: “Vy der hell
garn’t you bring me home der boiler to
eadt now und den, you lousy cow, nein?”

Business Rollery, ETE.
Another “Dramatic Turn”
r T'HE economic background
is one mostly of lower
wool prices, reduced metal
prices, lower prices for
meat and most dairy products,
failure of the wheat crop
in N. S. Wales and Queens-
land, drought in many
parts that has been more
severe on agriculture than on
grazing, and uncertain economic
conditions developing in
France, Great Britain and
India, as well as in nearer Asia.
Notwithstanding these things,
Australia is, up to now, a very
busy country.
Part of the picture also takes
in the efforts, at Treasury and
central-bank level, to curb
inflation in Australia and con-
serve overseas funds. In spite
of these efforts there has been
some further rise in the cost-
of-living in the Commonwealth,
but the upsurge does appear to
have been steadied.
The all-over economic picture
is a complex one and a
changing one. Just as, under
date of -August 30 last, Dr.
Coombs, governor of the
central bank, reported “a
dramatic improvement in the
health of the Australian
economy” for 1956-57, so,
since the opening of the wool
sales, there has been an equally
dramatic change of a different
nature.
But the situation to an extent
holds its own shock-absorbers,
though these same shock-
absorbers may also have
inherent inflationary qualities.
One shock-absorber is the
effect lower prices will have on
overseas funds. These are
likely to be less robust, and
import-licensing will in such
a case be continued at
restrictive level. Under strict
import-licensing the Australian
manufacturer will have more of
the market to himself.
And right at the back of the
economic picture is the con-
tinuing lag in the carrying-out
of national development on the
scale demanded by our growth
in population. This shows up,
under scrutiny, as a backlog of
work awaiting a sufficiency of
unemployed manpower,
materials and money.
Carefully handled so as not
to breed outright inflation, the
national-works backlog is a
potential steadier in any major
trade-recession, but careful
planning in advance is needed
in order to get the utmost
value, present and future, out
of any credit-expansion based
on the carrying-out of needed
public works.
Cheaper Now!
A FEW stocks which can be
bought much more
cheaply then a month ago are
Kandos Cement (now 425.,
against 485.), Bradford Cotton
(335. 3d., against 435. 3d. early
this year), Bank of N.S.W.
(£36 17s. 6d., against £42),
Frederic Ash (475. 9d., against
"She's not your secretary any more, chief — she's
going to be Mrs. Bill Dobson.”
555.), and Tooth (475. 6d.,
against 51s. 3d.).
All of them are worth atten-
tion by anyone seeking equity
investments with reasonable
present yields and a promising
future.
A New Misima Float
EARLY next year, holders of
the shares in Oceanic
Minerals Development Pty.,
Ltd., aim to hand over their
interests to a new public co.,
Pacific Island Mines, Ltd. (to
be registered in Papua), which
will seek sufficient public funds
to explore leases on Misima
Island (Papua), with especial
interest in silver-lead in the
sulphides, but having regard
also to the other minerals
which may be found in the
area.
In the past the oxides were
successfully worked for gold
by Cuthbert’s Misima Gold
Mines, Ltd., which up to the
outbreak of war in the Pacific
paid £175,000 in dividends.
It is now thought that the
virgin sulphide zone of the
Misima lodes may constitute a
completely new lead, zinc,
copper and gold prospect of
great size and potential.
The auriferous lead-deposits
on Misima which have attracted
the present venture’s attention
include the Urnuna lode, which
is marked by a persistent line
of mineralisation extending
four miles n.-w. across the
island. It is this lode which in
the past supplied the bulk of
the island’s gold and silver pro-
duction.
Past operations were con-
centrated towards the centre
of the line, where the lode was
mined in the oxidised zone
over a maximum width of 30ft.
and a maximum continuous
length of 4000 ft.
Though there are consider-
able tonnages of oxidised
remnants which may be worth
exploitation later, the pro-
moters of the new venture
believe that the mining future
of Misima will be determined
by the metal-contents of lodes
in the sulphides, and pre-
liminary investigations, to take
the form of churn-drilling
and/or adit-driving, will be
largely concentrated on the
virgin sulphide zone. The co.
holds 14,000 acres under
mining-lease or prospecting-
reserve.
It is intended to raise
£lOO,OOO from the public, and
to issue 80,000 2s. 6d. shares
(£10,000) to the vendors in full
payment, apart from £2500 of
out-of-pocket payments.
Though Misima Island is on
the list as the first prospect,
Pacific Island Mines, Ltd.,
intends to prospect and explore
anything attractive that offers
in the South-west Pacific area.
Though the price of lead is at
present considerably lower than
it was earlier this year, Pacific
Island Mines will naturally be
more concerned about what
lead fetches in five years’ time.
Metal Shares Up
EOLLOWING comments on
the depressed state of the
market for metal shares in
B. 30 /10/’57 there was a
smart recovery in Barriers and
Mt. Isa on the same day. The
recovery continued to the end
of last week, when there were
again signs of a slackening.
An expenditure of £5O
million, spread over many
years, has been forecast by
Consolidated Zinoin respect of
the Cape York bauxite deposits.
The B.H.P. Cash Issue
EOLLOWiNG the one-for-
-4| bonus-issue financed out
of snare-premiums, Broken
Hill Proprietary will make a
one-for-five (in relation to the
bonus-increased capital) cash-
issue at par, amounting to about
£9 million. The two issues will
raise paid capital to round
about £53 million.
Books close for the cash-issue
on December 24, with first pay-
ment (10s.) due in February.
At a present cost of 475. 3d. a
share, ex rights to the bonus-
issue, the cost ex the cash-issue
will be 425. 6d., and the yield
on an 8| p.c. div. basis will be
3.9 p.c.
If issues aggregating two-for-
five (in relation to capital after
this new cash-issue is com-
pleted) are made in ensuing
years, the yield on an 8| p.c.
div. basis will rise to no more
than 4.63 p.c.
On a 10 p.c. div. basis the
return would still be rather less
than 5.6 p.c.
That would be on a paid
capital of about £75 million.

horizon.”
On the strength of this,
Eclipse Gold Mines, N.L., is
being floaled in Sydney.
According to Kevin J.
Finucane, consulting geologist,
“excluding the possible 10,000
additional tons to a depth of
635 ft. on the Eclipse Extended
shoot, and the unbroken ore in
the Eclipse East shoot,” the
estimate of proved, broken
and probable ore is 14,460
tons, averaging 38dwt.
According to the same
authority, the one important
ore-body proved to date in the
group of leases is the Eclipse
Extended shoot. This
occurs on a cross-fault in a jaspilite
bed 60ft. thick, and is 60ft. to 70ft.
long and 6-)ft. wide. The estimated
average grade of this shoot at the
215 ft. level is 33.8dwt. per long ton,
based on samples of approximately
30ib. weight broken across the full
width of the lode at sft. intervals.
At the 325 ft. level the estimated
average grade is 39.4dwt. per long
ton, based on a trial crushing of
90.6 long tons broken under opera-
tional conditions, over the full
length of the shoot for an average
height above the drive back of I.6ft.
A double-check was made of the
grade at the 325 ft. level by means
of a total of 27 grab-samples taken
after each cut was fired, and by
brace-sampling. The mean of these
two series is 41.1dwt. per ton, and
this agrees within reasonable limits
with the crushing return.
Three depressed diamond-drill
holes have been bored from the
south-east drive at the 325 ft. level
to test the downward extent of the
shoot. No. 1 D.D. intersected the
shoot 90ft. vertically below the
level, the intersection assaying
69.9dwt. over an equivalent
horizontal width of 86 inches. No.
2 D.D. intersected the shoot 310 ft.
vertically below the level, assaying
29.7dwt. over an equivalent
horizontal width of 24 inches. No.
3 D.D. directed to intersect the
shoot at a horizon intermediate
between the other two intersections
did not locate ore.
With incomplete evidence it is
difficult to evaluate these drilling
iesulls....
However, Mr. Finucane
points to the possibility of
10,000 tons of ore to a depth
of 635 ft., and says that the
development of a major ore-
body in the main jaspilite
bed would probably be con-
tingent on some major struc-
tural change in it other than
the cross-fractures which are
a feature of the geology. It is
along breaks in the jaspilite
beds that most of the high-
grade payshoots occur.
The estimated 14,640 tons of
ore considered to be in sight
can be worked for 2475. a ton,
the prospectus says, and
estimated profit therefrom is
put at 2935. a ton. Total profit
in sight, estimated to be won
within two years from the
start of production, is reckoned
at £212,000.
The co. has hopes of
developments beyond those
mentioned in these estimates.

Bell Bay Aluminium
[From “Old Opencut”]
npHE Australian Aluminium
Commission has tabled its
report for the 1956-57 year in
Parliament on the Bell Bay
undertaking.
The report and balance-
sheet were presented on time
and correct to accountancy
standards.
Production at the beginning
of the financial year was at a
rate of 9784 ingot-tons a year.
At the end of the year output
had been stepped-up to 11,250
tons. The designed and, by
then, installed capacity was
13,000 tons.
Power for production above
10,000 tons was not available
until January, 1957, by which
time the linings of some of the
earlier-installed furnaces were
due for renewal.
The commission sold 10,085
tons of ingot at an average
price of £270.91 a ton. It was
sold at £267 10s. until Septem-
ber, 1956, when a £lO increase
became necessary. This figure
was 6.1 p.c. higher than the
landed cost of Canadian metal,
and local consumers, using
their import-licences, left Bell
Bay holding stocks.
Limited storage-capacity and
ready cash forced the sale,
overseas, of 650 tons at a loss.
In the previous year’s opera-
tions 4500 tons was produced
and sold at an average rate of
£261 10s. At this production-
figure and selling-price a
trading loss of £144,578 was
inevitable. This year the plant
showed an operating profit of
£52,359 (subject to interest and
other charges); £113,292 is set
aside for depreciation (£44,520
in 1955-56), not enough by a
long chalk for this particular
industry. •

serious problem. The commis-
sion did well to achieve the
recorded output in what must
have been a difficult year.
The payroll totals 929 —197
staff and 732 operatives, a very
high figure for the tonnage,
but probably including some
construction-workers.
The labor turnover for the
year was 106 p.c., touching
117.5 p.c. in the first six
months, but improving to 89.5
p.c. in the last term, a figure
still far too high for efficient
operation.
The power position is not
bright for continuous opera-
tion and future expansion :
35,000 h.p., sufficient for a
yearly output of 10,000 tons,
is on a firm basis, but the
additional 11,000 h.p. now
being supplied for maximum
production is subject to can-
cellation at six months’ notice.
Six months to cool-off one-
third of the reduction capacity
and, of course, another six
months to start them up when
the power becomes available.
It still looks the shot to
double alumina - production
at Bell Bay—not much capital-
expenditure involved—and set
tip a reduction-plant on the
mainland in any State with an
electrical authority able and
willing to supply power.
Overseas producers are not
letting-up in the South Pacific
area. Increased production
and lower costs are necessary
to get the industry on its own
feet and off the backs of the
taxpayers.
Small Mines and Canberra
[From J. W. Reddle, Slirimp
Battery, N.Q.J
nrHE numbers, titles and
salaries of Federal public
servants outlined in “The Sky
the Limit” (B. 25/9/’57), and
the necessity of providing funds
for same, may account for the
cheeseparing methods
employed by some Federal
departments in dealings with
the public, particularly primary
producers, and the narrow
interpretations given to pro-
visions framed to “foster
production.”
A few years ago, partly for
the extra convenience, but also
because it appeared that, with
the dwindling population of the
field, the local telephone-
exchange at Ewan (N.Q.) might
close down, a five-mile private
line was run to connect to it.
Early this year, with the
departure from Ewan of a
mining syndicate which also
attended to the telephone (and
no one else to take over), the
exchange was closed. The
P.M.G. then connected the
three subscribers at the
exchange direct to the main
telephone-line to Townsville —
90 miles—giving a very accept-
able continuous service.
However, shortly afterwards,
a demand was made that these
subscribers should buy and
maintain the section of the
department’s line —tree-to-tree
—between Ewan and the next
exchange (Hidden Valley),
about 18 miles. Representa-
tions further afield scotched the
proposal.
The Sales Tax Exemptions
Act provides that, if a motor-
vehicle is actually engaged “in
mining operations,” no sales-
tax is applicable on its pur-
chase. Last year our ’37 Chev.
utility stalled and rolled down
the hill at the mine. It had
been used for any and every old
]ob possible in and about the
mine and the treatment-plant,
including light loads of ore of
an evening returning from
work, and had cut-out the
couple-of-miles walk each way
between the house and mine.
It was just as essential to our
mining operations as the jack-
hammers, being in fact a prior
necessity, more so as one
partner is married and still has
children of school age. Towns-
ville, the source of supplies, is
95 miles distant.
To avoid further hold-ups, no
Land-Rovers being available,
a four-forward-speed utility
was bought and remission of
the sales-tax applied for —but
refused.
Our association, when
applied to, advised that the
department’s interpretation of
the words “engaged in mining
operations” is very narrow and
means the vehicle must be used
for the cartage of ore. To our
mind it corresponds to what
would be Euclid’s definition of
a crooked line, or, as in “Angry
Importers” (B. 2/10/’57),
“natural justice in the depart-
ment appears to be overborne
by this rule of thumb.”
It took Mt. Isa Mines,
Ltd., quite a few years and a
High Court case to convince
officials that the provision of
homes and other amenities
for employees was within the
meaning of “mine develop-
ment” in the Act, so we still
have hopes, as we have been
well trained in persistence.
It took us a couple of years’
writing to get a permit to
export overseas copper-tin
sulphide (stannite) ores and
concentrates which one Aus-
tralian tin-smelter described
as “an unholy mixture.”
Possibly, though, that success
may have been due to the
intervention of a highly
placed State officer a
personal friend —when made
aware of the position.
However, apart from the
waste of time, the outcome
was not so bad, as the overseas
market prices had doubled
when the parcels did get there,
and maybe we got a bit of
training for a Literary Fund
grant later.
Whilst unloading, it is as
well to state we can see no
logical basis for the difference
in treatment between small-
scale goldmines and small-
scale base-metal mines, as the
base metal which is sold
abroad augments overseas
funds and that used in Aus-
tralia saves a drain on same,
which is all that gold does,
though easier to handle.
Despite the Prime Ministers
speech at Cairns early in the
year (“Fine people doing a
fine job— not forgotten, etc.,
etc.”) our response to mining-
engineer McMahon’s “Don’t
we want our small mines?”
(B. 11/6/’55) would be an
innocent “Do we?”
Maybe Brisbane, Canberra
and Melbourne are too far
away from Cairns for any-
thing said in the last-named
place to register with the
departments.


STREETS ICE CREAM LTD
Record Net Earnings and Sales—Long Term Supply
Agreement Completed —New Factory at Newcastle.
The Chairman of Streets Ice Cream Ltd.. Mr. K. Wiseman, at the 23rd
Annual Meeting held in Wollongong on 31st October said:
We jmeet tonight to execute the
business of the 23rd Annual Meeting
of the Company and it is again my
privilege to submit for your
approval and adoption the Report of
the Directors, the Report of the
Auditors, and the prescribed
Financial Statements for the year
ended 30th June last.
1. THE BALANCE SHEET—
Consolidated Balance Sheet
includes the assets and liabilities of
Streets lee Cream Limited and
wholly owned subsidiaries, Lynam’s
Ice Cream Pty. Limited and Ice
Cream Messengers Pty. Limited.
Comparison with last year shows
the- following movements:
(a) FIXED ASSETS as a result
ol the capital expenditure rendered
necessary by expansion rose by
£166,490 made up as follows: Land
and Buildings, £76,392; Plant and
Machinery, £57,670; Motor
Vehicles, £31,372; Office Equipment,
£1,056.
(b) CURRENT ASSETS increased
by £78,513 as follows: Stocks,
£21,116; Debtors, £6,464; Cash at
Bank, etc., £21,010; Investment in
Commonwealth Bonds, £29,923.
<c) INTANGIBLE ASSETS
decreased by £33,963 representing
Goodwill debited to Profit and Loss
Appropriation Account. As a con-
sequence of this write-off, the only
intangible asset which now appears
is the difference between book and
par values of shares in subsidiaries
set at £40,300.
(d) STOCKHOLDERS’ FUNDS
increased £185,586 represented by :
Capital Issue, £108,832; Undistri-
buted Profits, £26,754; General
Reserve, £50,000.
Whilst dealing with this item, it
is interesting to compare that in
1952 Stockholders’ Funds totalled
£604,654, whereas in 1957 they
totalled £1,089,466. an increase in
the five years of £484,812 or approxi-
mately 80%. Of this increase, only
£108,832 represented introduction oi
r.ew capital.
(e) CURRENT LIABILITIES
rose by £25,454 being: Trades
Creditors, £15,145; Provision for
Income Tax, £8,309; Provision for
Long Service Leave, £2,000.
The principal feature arising from
this review is again the remarkably
liquid and solvent nature of the
finances. The surplus of Current
Assets over Current Liabilities pro-
vides £75,768 available as working
capital for conducting the business.
Taken all round, I am satisfied
that the Balance Sheet will present
to .you an excellent and most com-
forting picture and I feel sure you
will be pleased with the efforts of the
Directors and Employees in con-
tributing towards this result.
2. THE PROFIT AND LOSS
ACCOUNT—
This Account shows that the Trad-
ing Profit of our group amounted
to £288,663 before tax, after charg-
ing £2,495 for Directors’ Fees and
£82,928 for Depreciation of Fixed
Assets.' Provision of £117,000 has
been made for taxation at the new
rate, leaving a residual net profit
of £171,663, which is £21,255 higher
than last year, an increase of 14%.
The Net Profit is equivalent to an
earning rate of 31.5% on the
increased Subscribed Capital; and
to 15.8% on the total value of
Stockholders’ Funds.
In considering Net Profit,
Depreciation has been provided at
£82,928, which exceeds last year’s
allocation by £29,428. In view of
the rapidly accelerating trend
towards automatic machinery the
Directors considered it advisable to
increase normal rates of deprecia-
tion to provide a'prudent coverage.
The Company’s buildings, plant,
and machinery are in good order
and the figures shown in respect of
them in the Balance Sheet are
realistic but still conservative.
After adding the Net Profit of'
£171,663 to the carry forward of
£285,226, the total amount at
credit of the Profit and Loss Appro-
priation Account was £456,889.
After debiting final and interim
dividends and transferring £50,000 to
General Reserve and £33,963 to
write off Goodwill, there remained
a carry forward at 30th June of
£311,980 to augment Stockholders’
Funds and provide funds for future
operations.
ASSET BACKING
The net tangible asset value of
each £1 stock Unit has improved
and now stands at 38/7 compared
with 38/1 last year. As against this
asset value, the market value has
remained steady in recent months
it: the vicinity of 51/-, which
evidences that our Shares have won
(he confidence of the investing public
and their advisers.
1 have recently returned from a
visit through the Central West and
1 regret to say that I found the
drought conditions to be as reported.
There would not appear to be any
doubt that feed and food will be in
short supply next year; that costs
will rise accordingly and that the
money market will demand an even
greater premium than has hitherto
been the case. Producers and manu-
facturers who have conserved their
stocks and taken advantage of the
stable conditions and good seasons
experienced during the last five
years, will be well placed to with-
stand these impacts should they
eventuate. I think that this Com-
pany can -be classified in such
category and should have no
difficulty in weathering any adverse
season.
DIVIDEND
After taking into account our
budget for future Capital Expendi-
ture, it was considered that as much
as possible of the available funds
should be conserved to provide a
safe margin of working capital.
As a consequence, the Directors
recommend the payment of a Final
Dividend of 8% out of the profits
of the year. This, with the Interim
Dividend of 6% paid last March,
will give a total dividend for the
year of 14% absorbing the sum of
£69,653 and leaving a balance of
£104,255 to be carried forward in
Profit and Loss Appropriation
Account to provide working capital.
NEW SHARE ISSUE
During the year, the Directors
decided to call in new capital by
making an issue to existing stock-
holders of £1 Shares at par in the
ratio of 1 for 4 held. This raised
the previous Subscribed Capital of
£435,330 to £544,162 yielding
£108,832. At that stage, the estimate
of capital expenditure for the
immediate year envisaged further
additions at Turrella, .Corrimal and
Parramatta, together with the con-
struction of new depots at New-
castle and at Gosford. Whilst it
would have been possible to finance
the requirements from existing funds
and bank overdrafts, the Directors
made the decision to approach the
Shareholders for two reasons; firstly,
so that the ready moneys available
would not be depleted but would
be available in case we wish to meet
competition in any particular respect
or to expand in any particular direc-
tion ; and, secondly, so that the
Shareholders would derive some
material benefit from the progress
made during the yeais.
As a consequence of the new
issue, we welcome many new Stock-
holders and we hope that they will
take a keen interest in the Company
and become staunch supporters of
our products.
It is interesting to note that those
Stockholders who purchased their
Stock Units when the Company first
became listed on the Sydney Stock
Exchange in 1952 have received
excellent -returns and that the
capital value of their investment has
more than doubled in the interim.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
The increased volume of business
demanded additions to existing
buildings, new cold storage space,
new delivery tankers and trucks, and
construction and commissioning of
new depots at Newcastle and
Gosford. The total actually
expended during the year amounted
to £249,418, but the total contracts
of course exceeded that figure. All
our objects have proceeded accord-
ing to plan during the Winter
season and we are confident that we
shall be able to cope with the
increased demands should the season
be hot and dry.
All items of Capital Expenditure
are weighed carefully against the
possible savings and/or profits
which will accrue therefrom and
the Directors and Executives of the
Company are constantly striving to
introduce the most modern overseas
methods and techniques without in
any way diminishing the quality of
our products or the service to our
shopkeepers. At the same time, we
are mindful that expansion must not
be permitted at a rate inconsistent
with proper financial safeguards.
However, in some instances such as
installation of modern plant, pur-
chase of additional motor vehicles
and provision of additional cold
storage facilities,, regard cannot
always be had to the profit-making
nature of expenditure if we are
to maintain a strong front against
competition. The ice cream industry
is expanding as the per capita con-
sumption of ice cream and frozen
confections increases and we must
be ready with all facilities to absorb
as much of the - available new
business as can be derived by our
Sales Staff. The question of Capital
Expenditure is intimately vyrapped
up with that of dividend policy.
SUPPLIES OF RAW MATERIALS
During'" the year tlie Company
entered into a new long-term Agree-
ment with Dairy Farmers Co-oper-
ative Milk Co. Limited, ensuring
continuity of supplies of all milk
products whether in times of surplus
or drought. This will give a solid
foundation for future operations.
Our Company plays an important
role in the dairying industry pro-
viding a substantial outlet for milk
products, particularly at a time
when production of them is at its
peak. In view of this and of the
fact that in the recent Budget re-
lief was given from Sales Tax in
respect of fruit drinks and aerated
waters containing a proportion of
fruit juices, It is difficult to under-
stand why the Government does
not give further assistance to the
dairy industry by abolishing Sales
Tax on Ice cream. Such abolition
would facilitate reduced prices of
a product which is now becoming
more and more popular as part of
the staple diet of the Australian
community. The increased turn-
over which would then ensue would
result in increased profits to
primary producers and to users of
milk products such as this Com-
pany. As a consequence, the Gov-
ernment would more than gain in
income tax the amount of revenue
represented by the abolition.
SUBSIDIARIES
Lynam's lee Cream Pty. Limited
liad a very satisfactory year and is
now well equipped to take advan-
tage of tlie increasing business in
tlie progressive area embracing
Parramatta and western districts.
This subsidiary is .well consolidated
in its area of operations, and the
trade is of a much more substan-
tial nature than when the business
was first acquired. The Executive
Staff and the employees are to be
congratulated on their efforts.
Whilst making reference to
Lynam's Ice Cream Pty. Limited
1 wish to record our regret
at the death of Mr. E. Y. Lynarn,
which took place during the year.
He was tlie founder of the busi-
ness, and we convey sincere sym-
pathy to Mrs. Lynam and her
family.
Ice Cream Messengers Pty. Limited,
our retail vending organisation,
also had a very successful year.
TRADING CONDITIONS
These were reasonably stable
and cost increases were capable
of fairly accurate advance, estima-
tion. As a consequence, it was
possible to fix prices for our pro-
ducts anticipating a sustained
profit margin.
Stability aided by favourable
conditions in respect of raw mate-
rials, by keen merchandising, by
the introduction of new lines
which proved appealing to the
public and by the long “Indian
Summer” enabled record figures to
be achieved in sales and profits.
As disclosed in the Report, mone-
tary sales totalled £1,701,858 as
against £1,542,562 last year—an in-
crease of 10.3%. The percentage
of net profit on sales was 10.1%
as against 9.8% previously.
Goulburn Depot returned results
for its first full year of operation.
These showed that the service now
available in that district has been
appreciated both by shopkeepers
and the public alike. Gosford
Depot was established in Novem-
ber, 1956. A regular delivery ser-
vice was organised and the results
have been very satisfactory.
CURRENT PROSPECTS
Since the Ist July, sales have
continued to progress and are
higher than those for the same
period last year. In August, the
construction of the new depot and
first stage of the factory being
established at Newcastle were com-
pleted. Trading commenced there
on the Bth August subsequent to
an intensive market survey. The
forecasts made by this survey have
been proved, and we look forward
to the success of this venture. The
depot is erected on a favourable
site at Lambton, and an adjoining
cottage has been purchased for use
by the supervising foreman. Mr.
Eric Grover, who was formerly
Chief Accountant at Turrella, has
been appointed first Manager at
Newcastle.
Our whole organisation has
now been provided with most
modern and efficient buildings and
machinery, and we look forward
to the future with every confidence.
OVERSEAS VISITS
The Managing Director, Mr.
Edwin Street, and the Assistant
Managing Director, Mr. R. M.
Street, visited the U.S.A. recently
to examine certain projects and to
investigate particularly new de-
velopments in the marketing and
production of ice cream and similar
products.
DIRECTORS
No changes have occurred in the
the composition of the Board, and
each Director has given close and
loyal service throughout the year.
Messrs. R. R. Merrett and William
Simpson retire by rotation; and I
ask that you be good enough to re-
elect them again.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, I wish to convey
the thanks of the Stockholders and
of the Directors to those whose
combined efforts have achieved the
magnificent results disclosed in
the Report.
Lastly, but most importantly,
we thank our customers and sup-
porters for their valued patronage
and goodwill, and we pledge our-
selves to a policy of producing
appealing goods of first quality at
minimum prices coupled with re-
liable and prompt service.

“Nex’ Town”
Reviewers, they say, should
stay out of their reviews, but
in the case of this new musi-
comedy at the Independent
Theatre, North Sydney, there
would seem to be some excuse
for breaking that rule. . .
Rather more than 21 years
ago, Rob Morris and I drove
into Youanmi, a little gold-
mining town on Westralia’s
Murchison, in a 1924 T-model
Ford with a steaming radiator
and a banging big-end. We
were looking for work we
literally hadn’t the price of a
feed between us and our last
meal had been on the road
between Mt. Magnet and
Youanmi when we shot and
stewed a pathetically small
pigeon with a couple of onions
and a scraping of flour from
the bottom of our tucker-box.
We’d heard way back in
Geraldton that they were
putting on men at Youanmi, so
we pointed Leaping Lena in
that direction and let her have
her head at the maximum
35 m.p.h. We got a start on
the mine a couple of days later,
bogging on the 300 ft. level in
P-shaft on Arthur Head’s shift,
and learned for the first time
in our young lives that you had
to work for your wages.
Still, it wasn’t a bad life
after the blisters hardened. We
lived in the compound, fed well
in the mess run by Mrs. Cass
and her daughters, and soon
came to know what a good
bloke the Westralian goldminer
is. I’ve forgotten a lot of
names I should remember, but
Long Bill Murray, Leo, Johnsie
and Big Yorkie come readily to
mind; then there were Pat
Macnamara and Jimmy
Ferguson, both handy with
their fists as I remember ; there
were little Paddy Maclntyre,
the timberman who showed me
how to use a shovel, and Paddy
Carr, who introduced me to
the machines.
Then there were Gordon
Thompson, Slap Bateman and
Andy O’Hare. I recall them
particularly because they were
all in hospital together, their
beds side by side on the
veranda, on the night Bill
Murray won forty or fifty quid
at the heads-and-tails school
in the old billiard-saloon. Bill
filled a sugarbag with beer and
other grog and we went up to
the hospital. I’ve forgotten
how long the party lasted, with
occasional return visits to the
pub, but the legend always was
that, after we had gone, Slap
Bateman got out of bed and,
in his pyjamas and with a leg
in plaster, walked the mile or
so to the pub and back again
for further supplies.
Next morning, Andy (a mile)
concussion job, I think) was
running quite a temperature and
the matron fronted the three
patients: “I don't mind you
boys having a drink or two
while you’re here, but I found
three dozen empties under the
veranda this morning and if
it happens again I'll have to
tell the doctor.”
They were good times and,
like all good times, seem even
better looking back on them.
Rather less than 20 years ago
I left Youanmi with the offer of
a job on The Bulletin in my
pocket. Before I set off on the
long trip to Sydney, we cele-
brated in the pub, singing: ■
The lode is on the hanging wall,
The dirt is on the floor.
There’s nothing much left for
you to do,
So bore, you bastards, bore.
And, finally,
Goodbye, Mr. Sellon,
Goodbye, Warwick, too.
Ever since / left old Ireland,
I’ve been mucked about by you.
Or words to that effect, any-
way, Warwick and Sellon being
manager and underground-
manager and, in case the rhyme
suggests otherwise, both good
blokes.
I heard long ago that
Youanmi has all but vanished
—the mine closed down and
with it went the main reason
for the town’s existence, and the
men who worked there are no
doubt scattered about the
goldfields from Kalgoorlie to
Marble Bar. For my part, 20
years in Sydney had almost
wiped out the memory of the
town until I went along to the
Independent Theatre on behalf
of The Bulletin the other
night to see Peter Scriven’s
presentation of “Nex’ Town,”
which turned out to be a
delightful musicomedy about a
travelling sideshow stranded in,
of all places, Youanmi.
I was so surprised by this
coincidence that at first I had
the vague feeling someone was
having me on. Then, inevitably,
I found myself noting that the
policeman in the show should
have been dressed in khaki
instead of blue, that there
shouldn’t have been a railway
in Youanmi, that the pub was
on the wrong corner, that you
don’t salt goldmines as Mrs.
Copley, the publican, does it —
planting nuggets like daisies
all over the place.
That, of course, was an
utterly wrong and unjust
approach to a musicomedy
plot—a wispy, almost ballet-
like tale about the friction
between the sideshow people
and the townsfolk, with a
couple of complicating love-
affairs thrown in and the whole
pother happily solved when
Mrs. Copley scatters her
nuggets like a prodigal planter,
thus ensuring that the mine will
be reopened and prosperity
return to the town —but, even
though aware of the injustice,
I still found it impossible to
separate the memories of reality
from the light, good-humored
fictions on the stage,
In this confusion of mind,
however, it did break through
that, musically, the show has
been remarkably well served by
Iris Mason and Hal Saunders
with a string of insistently
tuneful ditties: “Nex’ Town,”
“A Man’s Mad,” “The Plot
Song,” “Shootin’ Through,”
“Hullo, Joe” —these and others
all seem to be “hit-parade”
material.
Neil Williams’s baritone is a
tremendously useful centre-pin
for the singing, with Yvonne
McLeod singing the romantic
lead opposite him very charm-
ingly, and Laurel Mather
doing likewise as Mrs. Copley
and making a particularly
attractive number of “Hullo,
Joe” —Joe (smoothly played by
Ken Fraser) being the Federal
member for Youanmi and Mrs.
Copley’s matrimonial target.
Betty Po u-nder’s dance-
arrangements are excellent,
and the Clown Ballet (with
David N. Martin as the clown)
and the Goldrush Ballet are
two of the most striking items
in the show; Janne Coghlan
and Bob Ainslie put something
very fresh and spontaneous
into their dancing.
Altogether a vigorous and
highly entertaining musical,
produced with skill and
imagination by Haydee Seldon,
and nicely decorated by Peter
Hurst’s costumes and even
more so by what goes in them.
It is probably the best thing
of its kind yet originated in
Australia, and, of course,
certainly the best thing ever
to come out of Youanmi.

“Elijah”
Alert and vigorous, con-
ductor Gerald Williams
emphasised the dramatic
qualities of Mendelssohn’s
oratorio at the performance at
Sydney Town Hall by the
Sydney Philharmonic Society.
Chorally, there were some
weaknesses, notably among the
male voices—a weakness that
seems to afflict most choral
societies —but the sopranos sang
with especially good tone and
weight.

oratorio since “The Messiah,”

Kenneth Jack
In the stone canyons of
King’s Cross, at the Terry
Clune gallery, Kenneth Jack's
watercolors of the Victorian
countryside contrast a little
oddly with their surroundings;
and yet, being chaste, severe,
mathematical, have a certain
affinity.
Essentially the work of a
draftsman almost a carto-
grapher—their virtue is that of
precision: precision of line,
precision of pattern ; and this,
combined with quiet and
harmonious color, makes them
at once a little formal and
exceptionally attractive.

Canadian Art
Indistinguishable from the
“contemporaries” of Australia
or New Zealand, the Canadian
punters on exhibition at the
N. S. Wales National Gallery
are mostly more concerned to
reproduce the art of Paris than
to develop the art of Canada
. . . and what's the use of an
imitation of Picasso from
Montreal?
There are some lively
adventures, such as Kenneth
Tochhead's pegtops and bottles
and Paul-Emile Borduas’s
parachuting vegetables, but the
painters who look most likely
to say something distinctively
Canadian are Riopelle, whose
gigantic “Forest Blizzard” only
needs to look more like a forest
and less like a palette to be
immensely impressive, and Jack
Shadbolt, whose watercolor of
“New Snow” has an un-
expected bare force.

“Island in the Sun”
This screen-version of Alec
Waugh’s novel about color-
problems in the British West
Indies is generally well served
in matters of direction, acting,
scenery and crowd-scenes.
The problems include an
affair between the Governor’s
aide (John -Justin) and a
chocolate-colored typist on the
vice - regal staff (Dorothy
Dandridge); another between
a society woman (rather color-
lessly played by Joan Fon-
taine) and a rabble-rousing,
aggressive young black poll-
tician (Harry Belafonte); and
the upheaval in one of the
English community’s top
families when it is disclosed
that a lilywhite family-tree had
a black branch a few genera-
tions back. Added to all that
is murderer James Mason being
played with by the police-
chief after the pattern of
Dostoievsky’s Crime and
Punishment.

THE DOLL AND THE UMBRELLA
By JILL LYONS
DID “Summer of the Seven-
teenth Doll,” “The Shift-
ing Heart- and “The Multi-
Colored Umbrella” rise
suddenly out of nowhere?
Playwrights cannot exist in a
vacuum.
It is surely no disparage-
ment to the authors of these
successful plays, or to the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust and
J.C.W., which are helping to
stage them, to call into the
limelight a group which has
never yet received Its due share
of applause: the Playwrights’
Advisory Board.
When Doris Fitton, Rex
Rienits and Leslie Rees inaugu-
rated the P.A.B. nearly 20
years ago, their aim was to help
the local playwright get his
work produced on stage; to
see that he was paid for it;
also, where possible, to have his
plays published.
Not that there was, at that
time, the faintest immediate
hope of persuading commercial
managements to present local
work; but there were the
hardy Little Theatres in the
capital cities, and the drama-
groups in the country towns.
In these fields, the market was
wide open—although the box-
office takings were likely to
look rather drought-stricken.
Of the original members of
the board, Leslie Rees, Beatrice
Tildesley and O. D. Bisset
remain. Past members were
journalist Josephine O’Neill;
playwrights Sumner Locke-
Elliott, George Farwell and
Dymphna Cusack; Lindsey
Browne, the “Herald” . drama
critic, was co-opted to help in
the judging of play-competi-
tions.
Since that far-off occasion in
1938, this “honorary organisa-
tion devoted to the advance-
ment of Australian stage play-
wrights and their plays” has
worked to carry out that ideal
in four practical ways: by
criticising hundreds of MSS.;
by negotiating well over 250
stage-productions of Austra-
lian plays and collecting royal-
ties on behalf of the authors ;
by sponsoring the publication
of plays; and by conducting
four competitions for fuil-length
stage-plays.
Members of the Playwrights’
Advisory Board now in office
(other than the three already
mentioned) include George
Cassidy, Gwen Harrison, May
Hollinworth, Alrene Sykes, lan
Maxwell, James Pratt, Allan
Ashbolt and Lindsey Parker.
Five are on the staff of the
A.8.C., and another four are
former members of Sydney
University Dramatic Society—
formerly directed by May
Hollinworth.
With years of experience in
S.U.D.S. and her own Metro-
politan Theatre, it was May
Hollinworth’s productions of
fresh, local material that caused
the most interest, and provided
fine parts for rising young
players such as Dinah Shear-
ing, Betty Lucas, Brenda
Senders, Leo McKern, Frank
Waters, Kevin Brennan, Nigel
Lovell and Owen Weingott.
Two of these most successful
productions were in the chal-
lenging field of modem verse-
drama ; Douglas Stewart’s
“Ned Kelly” and “Shipwreck.”
Others were Catherine Dun-
can’s “Sons of the Morning”
(also a verse-drama) and
Dorothy Blewett’s “The First
Joanna” —both prizewinners in
different jcompetitions spon-
sored by the P.A.B.
Inspired by the Australian
campaign in Greece, “Sons of
the Morning” was the first play
to win the £lOO first-prize (the
prizemoney for these competi-
tions has each time been
awarded by businessmen) and
at one time was playing con-
current seasons in two Sydney
little theatres—each production
with a different ending.
Catherine Duncan, who has
returned to Australia after liv-
ing in France for some years, is
at present editing a new edition
of one-act plays partly supplied
by the P.A.B. for the Tas-
manian Adult Education
Board ; this is a practical “pro-
duction set” (one for producer,
one for stage-manager, one for
lighting, etc.) designed to ease
some of the technical diffi-
culties that beset many little
theatres.
Another author-actor re-
turned from exile is of course,
Richard Beynon, winner of the
Sydney Journalist Club Play
Competition for 1956, with his
comedy-drama “The Shifting
Heart.” Beynon thinks thaf
the heavy post-war traffic of
young Australians on trips
abroad is paying off in an un-
expected way: all they have
seen in the way of European
culture will fire them with a
taste for theatre which will
remain with them on their
return home. Thus Australian
dramatists of the future will
have preconditioned audiences
to play to, and can expect a
happier time all round.
But the P.A.B.’s most “his-
toric” moment was in 1955
when the youngest member of
the board (and playreader to
the A.B.C. drama department),
Alrene Sykes, unwrapped the
manuscript of Ray Lawler's
“Summer of the Seventeenth
Doll.” Although the Sydney
Journalist Club provided the
prize for the 1956 play competi-
tion, again it was the Play-
wrights’ Advisory Board which
undertook the reading and
judging of the 130-odd entries.
Members of the P.A.B. might
well be satisfied if all that had
resulted from the years of
patient reading and competitive
search had been these two
remarkable plays. But they find
it rather amusing that this
literally is the impression
abroad and even in Australia.
Ray Lawler has pointed out
the absurdity of the belief that
“The Doll” suddenly popped-
up out o£_. nowhere ; through-
out the whole of the 20th cen-
tury, writers such as Louis
Esson, Vance Palmer, Betty
Roland, Oriel Gray, George
Landen Dann, Dymphna

Waltons-Sears, Ltd.
ALTHOUGH vigorous and profitable
expansion over the past seven years
has already earned Waltons-Sears a place
amongst the largest retailers in the
country, the board is pushing ahead with
plans to extend further its operations as
both chain-store and mail-order retailer.
Over the next six years development
plans are expected to involve an outlay
of at least £6,000,000, and while Sears,
Roebuck can be expected to put up part
of this sum, as share-capital and
-premiums, ord. shareholders may also
have the opportunity of increasing their
stake in the co. A million of 74 p.c.
debentures is now being offered.
Originally concerned with the provision
of short-term credit, the co. was formed
in 1926 as Cash Orders (Amalgamated),
Ltd., but by 1937 it was also retailing
furniture, furnishings, etc., in the three
eastern States. The retail side of the
business developed steadily, and in 1952
the name was changed to Amalgamated
Retailers, Ltd., following the purchase of
the department-store business controlled
by Murdoch’s, Ltd., of Sydney.
An indication of subsequent develop-
ments was given in 1955, when the co.
(which had changed its name again, this
time to Waltons, Ltd.) joined with
American retailer Sears, Roebuck and
Co. to make an unsuccessful bid for Foy
and Gibson, Ltd. Later in that year it
was announced that Sears—which claims
to be the largest retail organisation in
the world —had taken up 2,014,600 ss.
ords. at a 100 p.c. premium and had been
given the option of increasing its share-
holding to 50 p.c. of issued ord. capital
on the same terms. The option will
remain in force until 1960, but may be
extended at the discretion of, the board.
Backed by its wealthy American asso-
ciate, Waltons-Sears then offered to buy
the ord. capital of Cox Bros. (Aust.),
Ltd. (for £3,719,000), but, after some
sharp * and well-publicised exchanges
between the two boards, the offer was
rejected.
Negotiations for the purchase of
Overall's, Ltd. (Brisbane), and Wakes
Consolidated, Ltd. (Melbourne mail-order
specialists), were, however, more success-
ful, and with the acquisition of a number
of country retailing-chains the co. now
trades through a total of 24 retail-stores
in N.S.W., Victoria and Queensland,
while an additional 12 catalogue-sales
stores contribute to the mail-order section
of the business.
Both debenture- and share-capital have
been used to finance the growth of the co.,
and £1,500,000 was raised last term by
the issue of 8 p.c. debentures, a final call
(oLlOd.) being payable next February on
scrip issued at par to shareholders in 1954
on a one-for-one basis.
Profit and income reached record
levels last term, turnover for the year to
July 31 increasing by more than 20 p.c.
to approximately £24,000,000 (compared
with £5,000,000 in 1950), net profit jump-
ing by £100,994 to £578,072 after pro-
viding an undisclosed amount for
taxation and £66,637 (up £28,694) for
depreciation:

Eight existing country stores came under
the control of the co. during the year,
and, with the establishment of the mail-
order division, many items of a non-
recurring nature were charged against
earnings. The earning-rate on the higher
average ord. capital was, however, main-
tained at 18.6 p.c., after allowing for pref.
charges, to give an average of 20.2 p.c.
over the last three years. A 15 p.c. ord.
div. was sent out for the eleventh suc-
cessive term.
A high proportion of outside money
to shareholders’ funds has helped the
board to hold the 15 p.c. ord. div.-rate
(and also to avoid the overcapitalisation
•which can easily occur in a period of swift
expansion), share-capital and reserves
accounting for only 37.5 p.c. of the

the £1,294,536 added to secured
liabilities, and with an extra
£1,621,286 against creditors, sundry
provisions, etc., and £412,661 from
new capital and premiums, the co. added
a net £783,294 to the book-value of fixed
assets, carried a further £2,051,918 in
book-debts and £359,541 in stocks.
Taking its lead from the successful
Sears organisation, Waltons-Sears plans
to erect department-stores in leading
suburban shopping-centres and at the
same time extend its mail-order opera-
tions. Large building-sites have been
secured in the Melbourne outer-suburb
of Clayton and at Bankstown (Sydney),
while the 12 catalogue stores, displaying
lines illustrated in the co.’s mail-order
catalogue, have all been established since
last February.
With its. eye on future rather than
immediate rewards, the sharemarket
prices the f.-p. ss. ords. at 20s. Id. to
return a modest £3 14s. Bd. p.c. from a
15 p.c. div., the contribs. paid to 4s. 2d.
fetching 18s. 6d. Including uncalled
capital, net tangible assets support the
scrip to the extent of Bs. 3d.
McPherson’s, Ltd.
npHE post-war demands of fast-growing
secondary industries have given a
great boost to the turnover and earnings
of this long-established merchant and
manufacturer, but sales remained rela-
tively steady last term, and higher profit-
margins appear to have been responsible
for an improvement in net profit.
The public first obtained . a share-
interest in McPherson’s 97-year-old
business late in 1944, when existing share-
holders made 225,000 f.-p. £1 ords. avail-
able, at a premium of 100 p.c. Since
then paid capital has climbed from
£777,849 to £4,419,777, and the div.-rate
from 8 p.c. to 124 p.c., the rapid growth
of the co. being financed mainly by its
shareholders. New scrip has been offered
at par in four of the last seven years, a
one-for-five issue being completed last
term.
The parent co., six subsidiaries and
four associated cos. are engaged in the
manufacture and/or distribution of an
extensive range of machinery, machine-
tools, pumps, bolts, motor-vehicle acces-
sories and engineering-supplies. Head-
office of the group, which includes an
N.Z. subsidiary, is in Melbourne, and
there are branches in all mainland States.
The parent’s turnover edged forward
by £31,257 to a record £12,909,213 last
term, notwithstanding that sales of most
lines, with the exception of bolts, were
affected by credit- or import-restrictions
in the first half of the financial year.
With divs. from subsidiary and other
investments £3104 stronger at £82,749,
and costs and expenses £12,384 lower at
£11,842,493, net profit advanced by
£28,650 to £721,469:

respectively, the earnings, claimed after
providing £428,000 (up £18,095) for
taxation and £139,046 (up £22,145) for
depreciation, equalling a return of 16.3
p.c. on paid capital, compared with 18.9,
25.6, 23 and 19.1 p.c. back to 1953.
Profits of subsidiary cos., less outside
interests’ share, rose by £6326 to £95,651,
representing 14.3 p.c. on the higher
capital-investment, as against 21.1 p.c. in
the preceding term.
Proceeds of the one-for-five issue and
retained earnings further strengthened an
already sound financial structure, the
additional £255,022 against shares in sub-
sidiaries reflecting the purchase of a
55 p.c. interest in Keep Bros, and Wood
Pty., motor-accessory merchant of Mel-
bourne, and a further investment in
Patiehce and Nicholson, Ltd., manufac-
turer of twist-drills, taps and dies:

overdraft, reducing it to £135,346, but
while stocks increased by £329,532, book-
debts slipped by £131,515. New ware-
houses were opened in both Sydney and
Brisbane during the year, the conservative
cost-/eAA-depreciation value of freeholds
rising by £146,274, a net £180,038 going
into new plant, etc.
At 525. the f.-p. £1 ords. would return

Pope Industries, Ltd.
TCACED with increasing competition
and counter-attractions in the domestic-
appliance market, Pope Industries,
Ltd., has been forced, over the last few
years, to spread its own net wider in
order to catch a fairer share of available
householder-budgeting.
The decline in Pope’s earnings is
especially due to the coming of television ;
so it was natural enough that early in the
current term the co. should branch-out
into the electronics field by buying the
shareholding in Thom and Smith Pty.,
Ltd., manufacturer of radio- and TV-
receivers and quondam vassal of the
unfortunate President Consolidated, Ltd.
This acquisition carried with it the right
to make in Australia the Motorola TV-
sets under licence from the U.S. patentee.
Other Commonwealth-wide activities
underline Pope’s proclivity for expansion.
Last term petrol-engines were added to
the firm’s front-rank products (refrigera-
tors, washing-machines, lawnmowers and
electric-motors). These are being turned-
out by the enlarged West Australian sub-
sidiary, Pope Engineering, W.A., Pty.,
Ltd. (formerly Beaufort Engineering Pty.,
Ltd.), which also manufactures refrigera-
tion sealed-units. In South Australia the
toolroom has been extended and re-
equipped, while in Brisbane, Sydney and
Melbourne branch-warehousing facilities
are being extended.
Bespeaking an efficient sales-organisa-
tion, the favorable reception, “substanti-
ally in advance of that planned,” accorded
the recently-introduced Pope* domestic
refrigerators has been largely responsible
for maintaining the co.’s trading-profit at
its present still-high level. However, while
the market continues to be oversupplied,
the outlook for spectacular advances in
this field isn’t encouraging.
The national output of home-refrigera-
tion units has fallen steeply since the peak
1955 term:

term) was 15.5 p.c.
To finance its new projects, the co.
has gone on adding to its paid-up capital,
although £340,000 of the increase has
taken the form of bonus-issues, financed
from asset-revaluation. Secured and
unsecured borrowings have been rather
heavy, with secured creditors now
£729,860 (up £126,500 last term). How-
ever, new share-capital enabled bank-
overdraft to be reduced by a commen-
surate amount, and the ratio of share-
holders’ equity to outside money appears
to be improving. With debtors down by
£28,085, stocks (£1,657,040 at the end of
June) represented a high proportion of
working-capital, but this can probably
be ascribed to a normal seasonal build-
up:—

the allotment of 200,000 fully-paid ss.
ords. and 1,360,000 ss. ords. paid to 2s.
brought paid-up capital to £1,266,000.

Current sharemarket quotes are 7s. 6d.

Evans, Deakin & Co. (Q.)
SUPPORTED by reserves over three
times the size of paid capital, the
£1 ords. in this prosperous and well-
established Queensland co. enjoy a strong
asset-backing and a wide dividend-cover,
the scrip commanding a substantial
premium on the sharemarket.
Formed in 1924, Evans, Deakin and
Co., Ltd., controls a business established
in 1911, its chief interests being ship-
building, general engineering and struc-
tural steelwork. Shipbuilding and
engineering activities are centred around
Brisbane, but the co. has maintained a
branch at Townsville for many years
(handling agency-sales of engineering
plant, etc.) and recently purchased a
foundry, engineering-works and slipway
in that city. A 25 p.c. interest is held
in the Queensland offshoot of Common-
wealth Engineering Co., Ltd., manufac-
turers of railway rolling-stock, etc.
The board’s policy of keeping the
annual distribution well within the
available earnings and ploughing-back
the surplus has paid-off handsomely over
the last 10 years, and, with a2 } p.c. bonus
added to the p.c. ord. div. last term,
shareholders have received divs. averaging
16 p.c. p.a. since 1948, as well as bonus-
scrip in 1950 (one-for-one) and 1953 (one-
for-three).
Paid capital includes 40,000 £1 7\ p.c.
prefs., participating to 10 p.c., and 60,000
£1 5-6 p.c. prefs. as well as £228,599 in
f.-p. ords. and £25,946 in fully- and
partly-paid employee-shares. Payments
on the employee-scrip last term lifted the
total on the register by £5005 to £354,645.
Last term (to June 30) the co. launched
the second of four 10,000-ton bulk-
carriers ordered by the Australian
Coastal Shipping Commission, and, with
both the engineering and structural-steel
divisions busy, there was a “small”


improvement in turnover.
Operating expenses were higher,
but the £4865 slip in net
earnings, as claimed by the co.
(£143,306), was more than offset
by the subsequent reduction in
rates of co.-tax:

The extension of activities at
Townsville contributed to a
£43,085 increase in the “cost
and/or valuation” figure given
for fixed assets but, although
debtors were slower to pay, the
co. ended the term with an
extra £40,299 in cash, bonds,
etc. Current liabilities a
miscellaneous assortment of
creditors and provisions—are
shown in total at £578,915 (up
£18,006).
Agencies for several new
lines of engineering equipment
have been obtained recently,
and some expansion of this
side of the business is planned,
while orders in hand, including
one for a 5200-ton cargo-vessel,
should ensure a satisfactory
turnover in the current term.

CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS
TWENTY-SECOND ORDINARY GENERAL MEETING
The Chairman of Duly and Hansford Ltd. (Mr. A. Duly) will give the following review
of the Co.’s activities at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on November 27.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have much pleasure in presenting to you
tHe Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account,
for the year ended 30th June, 1957, supported by
the Report of the Directors and the Auditor.
I he past year has been most successful in produc-
ing all-time records covering production, sales,
gross and net profit, also in salaries and wages
paid to Staff and Employees.
The Management endorse the payment of
incentives to Personnel to encourage better
relationship between the Staff and Management.
Such an incentive scheme, known as a “Production
Award,” has been in operation in the Company
over the past seven years and employees have
received substantial payments over and above their
normal salaries or wages.
Ihe staff Superannuation Plan operating since
1943 on a limited scale in conjunction with the
A.M.P. Society has been extended to cover all male
persons who qualify and wish to stay in the
Company’s service to an age of 65 years, if
desirable, and the value of the Policies under this
Scheme amount to £509,483.
Sales for the year recorded an increase of 14%
over those of the previous year, and are again
on the upward trend for the first quarter of this
current year.
Our Company’s contribution to the Industry of
manufacturing cars in Australia is rapidly increas-
ing to the stage where we are considered to be a
major supplier of Components.
The goodwill we have established with our
extensive range of customers' in Australia and
overseas territories has been well maintained.
We would again stress the fact that our Industry
is one of ever-changing models and designs, and,
in line with our Policy of keeping up to date
with such changes, two Members of our Engineer-
ing Executive have just returned from overseas
on a visit extending over four months in research
work in the principal Automotive Plants in the
LJ.S.A., the United Kingdom and Germany.
It is the intention of the Directors to continue
this Policy wherever necessary, as the results
obtained through the installation of Plant as
recommended from these visits, has resulted in
greater efficiency, and improved manufacturing
methods.
NET PROFIT.
£294,389 (last year £224,037), an increase of
£70,352 for the year. The Net Profit for the
year, after charging Depreciation amounting to
£54,140, is £294,389, and out of this profit provi-
sion of £116,000 has been made for Income Tax
payable. From the remaining profit, namely
£178,389, your Directors recommend the payment
of a final dividend at the rate of 10% per annum,
amounting to £52,344, which, with the interim
dividend paid in July, makes a total dividend of
£104,688 for the year, leaving a balance of
£73,701 to be added to the Accumulated Profits,
making the total amount carried forward £189,517.
RESERVES.
The total Reserves shown on the Balance Sheet
amount to £493,238 after giving effect to appropria-
tions recommended by the Directors, and with
the exception of Unappropriated Profits, have not
been drawn upon during the year.
LAND AND BUILDINGS.
£214,204 (last year £209,394) —Valuer-General
£287,550 at 22nd August, 1955. The additions for
the year amounted to £4,810, and this expenditure
is in line with the Directors’ Policy of acquiring
all available and suitable property in the surround-
ing area necessary for future development.
PLANT AND MACHINERY.
£500,397 (last year £452,869); after making
provision for Depreciation for the whole plant, the
Balance Sheet discloses a net increase of £47,528
after adjusting the liability under Hire Purchase
of £41,388, but the gross capital cost of new plant
installed during the year is £76,441.
DEPRECIATION.
Depreciation provision £54,140 (last year
£44,908). Adequate provision for depreciation
over the whole Plant has been made and shows
an increase of £9,232 above that of last 8 year.
All Plant and machinery has been maintained in
lirst-class condition throughout the year.
TAXATION.
£116,000 (last year £96,483) —an increase of
£19,517. The provision of £116,000 has been made
out of the Profits of the year at the new Budget
rate for Companies and is considered to be ample
to cover all taxation for which the Company is
liable, at the balance date.
SUNDRY DEBTORS AND BILLS RECEIVABLE.
£217,246 (last year £237,873). This item shows
a reduction of £20,627 in spite of the record
turnover. Collection of accounts has received close
attention during the year and all accounts are in
excellent condition.
STOCK INVENTORY.
£1,100,772 (last year £1,012,926). The increase
of £87,846 in this item is generally restricted to
raw material steel stocks which are considered to
be a sound investment.
BANK COMMENT. /
Bank Overdraft £289,864 (last year £289,066).
Your Directors have considered it prudent to
utilise bank funds to this extent, but do not
recommend the retention of the liability at this
figure.
FIJTURE DEVELOPMENT.
As a result of experience gained during visits
overseas by senior executives, your Directors have
decided to purchase and install additional modern
plant and erect the necessary Buildings, in keeping
with the Policy of equipping our Industry on the
same level as Industries overseas.
To finance this expansion and to provide
additional working capital, your Directors have
decided to issue 261,719 Ordinary Shares at Par
and to offer same to Shareholders in the propor-
tion of one new share for every four shares held
by them at the close of the Share Register at
5.00 p.m. on the 7th day of January, 1958, but
without regard to fractional interests.
Your Directors are of the opinion that it is
reasonable to assume that the Dividend rate of
10% per annum as paid for the past nine years
should be maintained on the increased capital.
The terms of issue will be £1 per share payable
on application not later than 4.00 p.m. on the
31st day of January, 1958. The shares issued will
be entitled to rank for dividend pari passu with
the existing ordinary shares from 1st day of
January, 1958, as if the profits had acciued in
equal proportions from day to day.
You will accordingly be entitled to apply for
and to be allotted the number of shares in this
issue to be shown by a circular which will be
forwarded in due course.
If you desire to renounce your rights to all
or any of your entitlement, you are recommended
to consult your Sharebroker in connection with
the sale of your rights.
CONCLUSION.
Your Directors take this opportunity to express
their appreciation to all people within the
organisation for the loyalty and assistance given
to the Management throughout the year. This
co-operation is largely responsible for achieving
the satisfactory results shown in the year’s accounts.
To our customers in Australia and overseas, we
again record our thanks for the support that they
have given to us.
A. DULY.
Chairman of Directors.

Broken Hill South, Ltd.
-EARNINGS of Broken Hill
South and its principal
subsidiary, Barrier Central Pty.,
were npt “materially” affected
last term by the sharp fall in
lead and zinc prices occurring
towards the close of the
financial year, but a “severe
reduction” in the current
term’s mining-revenue ' was
forecast by the chairman (G.
Lindesay Clark) at last week’s
annual meeting.
However, almost 30 p.c. of
the co.’s net profit comes from
an extensive—and growing—
investment-portfolio (valued in
the accounts at £4,663,088), and
while a large proportion of its
investments is in mining and
refining 'concerns, there are
substantial holdings in cos. not
directly connected with the
mining industry.
At June 30 last market-value
of the co.’s £2,064,907 of listed
scrip was over £4,600,000, total
income from outside invest-
ments increasing by £77,264
last term to £569,383, to
represent 14s. 3d. for each £1
of the £BOO,OOO paid capital.
Falling with the decline in
metal prices,. bids for South’s
f.-p. ss. ords. have slipped
from a “high” of 100 s. 6d. in
April to around 865., to
return £9 17s. Bd. p.c. from the
current 170 p.c. distribution, or
£6 19s. 6d. p.c. if the rate were
lowered to 120 p.c.
Although calculated on a
reasonably cau t i ou s basis,
limited ore reserves have for
some time complicated the
evaluation of investments in the
co., and at the end of last term
were “conservatively estimated”
at 1,750,000 tons (down 100,000
tons), enough to keep the mill
going for only a little under
five years at current produc-
tion-rates.
An authority -to - prospect
over Q. large area in the Broken
Hill district has been obtained
recently, but, as yet, the search
for new ore-bodies of significant
size has been unsuccessful.
Gold - and - copper leases at
Cobar (N.S.W.) were bought
last year from New Occi-
dental Gold Mines, N.L., and
investigation of the mines is
now in progress.
The combined ore-production
of South and Barrier Central
dropped by 5394 tons to
343,469 tons last term, the mill
handling 332,540 tons (down
4670 tons) :

A further 9478 tons (down
3977 tons) of oxidised ore went
direct to the smelter at Port
Pirie. Recoveries (South only)
were 95.6 p.c. of the lead and
90.9 p.c. of the silver in the
lead concentrates and 87.6 p.c.
of the zinc in the zinc con-
centrates.
Average metal prices realised
during the term did not vary
greatly fr-om those of the pre-
ceding period, but a £47,015
increase in the value of mine-
production at Broken Hill
(£6,685,833) was more than
offset by higher working-costs
aid railage charges, profits
from working-accounts con-
tracting by £377,197 to
£2,898,889.
The higher investment
income and smaller provisions
for taxation (down £317,836 at

£18,033 at £312,580) improved
the over-all picture, however,

Ore Samples and Assays
A WELL - QUALIFIED
mining man has drawn
The Bulletin’s attention to a
newspaper paragraph to the
effect that Kia Ora Gold
Corporation, N.L., reports that
“the 200 ft. north crosscut on
Metallic Hill lease has been
extended to 10ft. in ore showing
fine gold.” As the mining man
points out, the correct pro-
cedure is to have proper channel
samples cut and assayed. “It
only takes half a day to take
samples and have them assayed.
Even if it took a week it would
be better to await the result
rather than to issue a statement
whiqh means nothing.”

From Herbert Holman
YI/HAT makes a good Con-
servative? It is not a
sense of grievance at the ills of
the world, as with the Angry
Young Men It is not pre-
occupation with a rigid political
creed, as with ■ the Socialist.
Probably, in fact, the older men
and women who belong to
Conservative associations - up
and down the country have
but the flimsiest conception of
either the political issues of
the day or of how their leaders
propose to cope with them.
The Conservative Club in
a fair-sized town has changed
little: it is still the resort of
businessmen, varying in degree
from moderate prosperity to
affluence, whose single qualifi-
cation is the promise to
support their party on all
occasions. The Women’s Asso-
ciations are unashamedly social
and money-raising in character,
with never a lecture on politics
(or, for that matter, on any-
thing else) from year-end to
year-end.
But the real virility of the
party-membership lies in the
Young Conservatives. In every
residential district, from the
cheaper semi-detached villas to
the moneyed estates, there is a
flourishing and expanding
branch. The officers are keen
and recruits are willing. Young
men join because they like the
fellowship, and because they
like to meet the girls. And the
girls join because of the oppor-
tunity to meet the men. It
is a thriving and consistent
matrimonial agency.
So, these young people enjoy
their social contacts, marry-
off and, when no longer
“young,” go their several ways.
But those who take to the life
move on to the parent organisa-
tion. Many are assured
committee - members, experi-
enced organisers and fair
public-speakers by the time
they reach the age, thirty, which
is the prescribed threshold
between Tory youth and
middle-age. They constitute an
electoral force of some moment
which is much envied by their
opponents.
All Hailsham
This significance is important
in considering the Conserva-
tives’ annual conference at
Brighton, particularly in
noting the delegates’ reactions
to their leaders. Despite their
very real fears and apprehen-
sions, they did not revolt and,
notwithstanding the Govern-
ment’s present low standing,
went away united, reassured
and astonishingly confident.
If, beyond the skill with
which most Ministers con-
trived to gloss over the pressing
issues, the conference revealed
nothing new in thought or even
positive in action, there were
some interesting changes in
mood and personalities. The
delegates were obviously
delighted at the presence, and
the speeches, of several trade-
unionists who pleaded for
industrial amity and better rela-
tions.
Those Ministers who, by
appearance and repute,
epitomised the high Tory
prototype were received coldly.
And Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, after
initial applause that was largely
sympathetic, went on by his
oratory to earn, as no one else
did, a double - bow. Mr.
Thorneycroft, whose successive
pronouncements tend to lose
conviction, came off less well.
So, too, did the Prime Minister,
reading his speech as if it had
been prepared by someone
else half -an - hour before.
Obviously, Mr. Macmillan’s
apparent casualness, non-
committal style and absence of
crusading zeal were not what
his followers were looking for.
They wanted more dynamic
leadership.
This. was provided by the
party’s new “character,” Lo-d
Hailsham, who resembles the
conventional Tory as much as-,
on the way to his dip in the sea
that morning, he resembled
Leander. He dresses carelessly,
appears to act unaccountably
,and is markedly idiosyncratic.
Yet it was this portly, benign
Pickwickian who fired the con-
ference with the spark of
enthusiasm it yearned for. A
Lord who didn’t want to be
one and v/ho, they say, is only
waiting for the reform of the
Upper Chamber so that he can
go back into the Commons and
become, eventually, Prime
Minister.
At any rate, he is a man of
many parts with a bit of every-
thing, from a Gladstonian
Christian faith to a first-class
brain. Many people feel that
his talents were better employed
and more valuable to the nation
at the Ministry of Education,
which he has recently relin-
quished to lead the Tory
crusade. But at least, even to
the spontaneity of the facetious
bell-tolling incident, he seems
to have the rare gift of being
the right man at the right time.
An Outstanding “Hamlet”
The Old Vic season has
opened with a “Hamlet” that
may well be talked about for
years. For dynamism, clarity
of outline, literary force and
consummate stagecraft, Michael
Benthall’s production is
definitive and unsurpassed. And
the irony of his achievement is
that, so far from the Prince
carrying the play, the play all
but carries the Prince.
He has discarded the First
Folio of 1623 in favor of the
1604 Quarto edition. Thus the
“To be or not to be” soliloquy
is brought forward into Act 11,
the scenes with Polonius and
Ophelia are compressed, and
“O, what a rogue and peasant
slave . . . The play’s the thing”
brings the act to a very strong
close, the more so as Hamlet
is surrounded by the players’
open hampers as he delivers
the speech. This leads, power-
fully and logically, direct to
the play scene.
Other distinctive touches are
the costumes (early nineteenth-
century Grand Duchy) and a
use of lighting so masterly as
almost to dispense with the
need of a set. Unusual for a
beginning-of-season play, every
supporting character, save only
Osric, is self-assured and
sharply defined. Horatio (David
Dodimead) is grave and intelli-
gent ; Claudius (Jack Gwillim)
is, apparently, a clean-limbed
Brigadier; Polonius (Derek
Francis) is endearing in his
pomposity—it is a clever touch
to make the others humor him ;
Judi Dench, a newcomer,
although initially a colorless
Ophelia, is indelibly impressive
in her madness ; Coral Browne's
Gertrude is, perhaps, the
maturest of all interpretations,
for it combines womanly weak-
ness with womanish purpose ;
and Ronald Fraser’s grave-
digger endows the comic relief
with first-time naturalness.
The military stamp of the
production, so effective in
other ways,, severely taxes the
Hamlet of John Neville, who
suggests a subaltern among
field-officers ; he seems slight in
mind as well as in physique,
notwithstanding his elegance of
bearing and diction. The
essence of Hamlet is a strong-
even headstrong force of
intellectual character. Neville
approaches this later in the
play: the closet-scene and the
preceding one, with Claudius at
prayer, are superb. All that is
lacking is the sublimity of
personality with which the
great actor integrates his role.


The Greek
By ROY THEODORE
THE Greek's words
whipped and tore at the
Happy Dumpling in an
extravagance of verbal
violence: Like so many brutal
little hands slapping and sting-
ing her and pouncing on her
own trembling words to break
and mutilate them and glee-
fully whirl away the pieces.
Big brown eyes behind thick
lenses grew bigger, browner,
blinking rapidly.
The tears that shock held
back came later in the pantry
behind the big kitchen as she
fumbled at her coverall of once-
upon-a-time-white tattled with
grease-droppings. ,
“Thinks he can call me for
anything, he can think again.”
The sullen dark girl at the
sink went on with her vengeful
game of adding new chips to
old, ignoring the other’s sobs.
The Greek’s wife came in—
short, stout, face like a nice
fat shop-cat —bearing broken-
English comfort. “Is all right,
Is'bel ; is all right, Is’bel.” She
ran on softly and she did up
the coverall-buttons as fast as
the Happy Dumpling undid
them.
They gave up the buttons at
last and stood woefully facing
each other. The Happy Dump-
ling’s words wobbled out be-
tween blubbing shudders ; the
tears streamed on.
“Called me . . . called me a
soandso . . . No man’s . . .
We’ve all got a right to a little
respect.”
“Is all right, is’bel. He is
tired.” The hands moved out
in what-can-you-do? helpless-
ness. “Is too big, the shop.
With the small one was easier
... Is too much.”
The Greek yelled. The
Happy Dumpling was in the
kitchen again before she
remembered she was going to
finish and then she had four
plates of steak-and-eggs in her
hands and the world went on.
The lunch rush ended. The
Greek relit the roll he had
placed on a bench more than
two hours before. Thick hands,
fingers like the knags on a
potato, shook slightly. At the
end of the kitchen where he
stood there were twin vats with
a grease-crusted sheet-
iron funnel suspended
above to draw off
some of the fumes.
The Greek turned
down the thermostat
on each and from one
he drew out a wire-
basket of chips, hiss-
ing as they left their
hot- f a t bath. He
spilled them on to
other chips that lay
with once-cooked fish
and sausages in great
shallow trays on a
right-angle of benches.
He turned off the two
hot-plates that had
been on continuously
next to the vats. He
walked across the
room and sat at a
table.
The Greek was little
taller than his wife.
Fat, stub-necked, in-
destructibly broad. He
Y’d one hand across
his mouth, rubbing
thumb and fingers across
stubbled, tired foam-rubber:
a face in which the stiff-
ness of teeth would have
been an anachronism. He
was soundlessly talking his
thoughts, lips moving con-
tinuously. Eyes fixed on the
wall had the vision of marbles.
Sweat appeared on his fore-
head. The Greek could feel
his stomach balling-up: the
interlacing, knotting, squeezing.
Soon would come the
expected pain for which he was
never ready, knifing into that
chewing-gum ball of gut.
The Happy Dumpling sailed
up the ramp from the dining-
room, through the kitchen,
dropped her dishes in the
pantry and went on to the
concrete-floored shed beyond
the pantry fly-door.
A RN looked up, eased a
cigarette further away
from the white, lower-lip sore.
“Bit of a yike on earlier,
eh 7^
“That Greek!” .said the
Happy Dumpling. “Just says
anything that comes into his
head.”
“What was he on about?”
“Me mixing the orders. So
he said. More like him —he’s
half - deaf, anyway.” She
fingered the bridge of her
glasses more firmly back on to
her nose. “I told his missus
straight. One more bit of fun
like that and I’m off. Not stay-
ing to be kicked around like
a bit of furniture, I told her.”
“Told her that, eh?” Arn
licked the scene around in his
mind. “Should’ve told the old
buzzard himself.”
“Don't you worry about
that!” She floundered just for
a moment. “1 would have, too,
but she held me back. Anyway
you’ve got to be sorry for the
poor old thing really; he’s
half-deaf.”
Arn turned his concentration
back to the fish. One end of
his bench was piled with them,
a hose running to soften them
after 24 hours in the room-
sized refrigerator that took up
most of the shed-space. His
knife drove in under the head
of one, slid to the bottom of
the gut, was withdrawn for
a moment and then both head
and gut were removed, almost
in a single motion. Arn con-
tinued the cut to the tail, then,
more deeply, ran the knife
down again, separating flesh
from backbone. In a few
fnoments the other side, too,
was free and he trimmed the
pieces, cut them away from the
skin, and added them to the
neat pile of fillets beside him.
“Hullo, Dumpling.”
She turned. “Hullo, wart,”
she said happily. The Greek’s
son slapped her lightly on the
rump with his schoolbag. “Fat
and happy.”
“Skinny and silly,” she
replied, trying unsuccessfully
to sway her bulk away from a
second friendly swipe.
“Costa!” roared the Greek.
He was standing at the fly-
door, two fingers of one hand
raised in aV. The thin boy


pretended not to understand.
“Two,” said the Greek.
“Two what?”
“Two tins.”
“Aaw! The blokes are
picking me up for tennis, Pop!
Can’t 1 do them when I get
back?”
The V stayed up in heavy
emphasis. “Two!” When the
boy didn’t move his father
burst into an angry flow of
Greek. The boy answered
deliberately in English. “What
about Arn? He can do them,
can’t he?”
“Come on now, hurry up.”
A wave of his hand cut off
any further argument. “Climb
into your old clothes and
start.”
The way he pronounced
“climb” rhymed it with
“trim.” The boy corrected
him, saw 'the tightening round
his father’s eyes and hurried
off.
The Greek looked at the
Happy Dumpling, jerking his
head impatiently back at the
dark girl in the pantry. “Give
her a hand with those dishes,
Isabel. She be there till mid-
night.”
T OADING potatoes into a
bucket from an adjacent
shed, the boy tumbled some
into the potato-machine on a
bench beside Arn’s, turned on
the water and began swinging
a handle like a car-crank.
The potatoes hobbled about
inside the revolving drum, its
rough inner wall scraping off
the skins, the spray of water
cleaning them and sluicing
away dirt Und skin. He
opened a door set into the
drum and the potatoes spilled
down a chute On to the bench.
One by one he placed them
on a square of inter-set, criss-
crossed blades laid into the
bench. His other hand
stretched up, pulling down the
lever-bar of a 3in.-square head
that pressed each potato
through the blades. A scatter
of chips fell from below to the
kerosene-tin on the floor.
Two boys with tennis-
racquets appeared at the shed’s
outside door.
“Hullo, got trapped, did
you?” said one.
“Can’t all loaf,” said Costa
easily. One of the boys refilled
the potato - machine. Costa
went for more potatoes and
the other boy replaced him on
the chipper. The Greek boy
returned and took an advisory
post.
“Saw Vita on the milk-run
today,” said the boy swinging
the potato-machine handle.
“Who?”
“Vita, I told you. Out in
the garden in her pyjamas.”
“Vita Lipcombe!”
“Yeah,” he laughed. “Purple
pyjamas on and she was dig-
ging. She saw me looking, too,
and she just waved.”
They savored the scandal.
“Dju have her today?” Costa
asked.
“English and maths. She
didn’t say anything about me
seeing her.”
“Nut reckons she’s on with
a bloke from the Air Force
camp.”
“On with the whole lot,
more like.”
The Greek bustled out again,
nodded at the boys and spoke
to Arn. “He’s not taking long
to get someone to do his work,
eh?”
Costa flushed. “We don’t
mind, Mr. Enakis,” said one of
the boys. “We’ll get out to
tennis quicker if we all help.”
“Not him!”
There was a complaining
wail from Costa. The Greek
said abruptly, “You gotta do
the flounders for me.”
“That’s Arn’s job!” said
Costa indignantly.
“Arn’s job, Arn’s job—
always Arn’s job!” exploded
the Greek. He spoke to the
boys. “He’s do this at school,
too? ‘Not my job, teacher,
that not my job!’—Eh? He’s
do that the way he do with his
mother and father?”
There were tears in Costa’s
eyes. The Greek looked away
as he went on quietly, “Costa
—you doing the flounders. No
more argue, argue.” He flicked
a sentence at the man working
on the fish: “The union man s
up at Nick’s now; you better
go quick, Arn.”
Arn was'already putting the
untouched fish back into the
refrigerator. The part-time
work fhe fisherman did for the
Greek was settled for on a
strictly private basis that suited
both.
AN intense man, suspicious
of the Greek, the union-
secretary was fiercely
“whaddabout-the-worker.” He
closed the wages-book that the
Happy Dumpling and the dark
girl had been busily filling-in
before he arrived and as the
Greek went off to attend to an
order he spoke quickly and
softly to the Happy Dumpling.
“Who’s he got out the back
these days?”
The Happy Dumpling had
her loyalties. “Himself. Only
himself and the boy, Costa.”
“Come on,” he coaxed. “I
know he’s got someone from
the port. Arn Patton, isn’t it?”
She said nothing.
Bony hands protruding from
showily-scruffed cuffs went on
earnestly matching knuckles.
“Look, we need everyone in the
union: we’ve got to stick
together. Is it Patton?”
The Happy Dumpling looked
at him curiously. “Didn’t you
hear me, Mr. Rogan? Just
himself and the boy, I said.”
The Greek came back in that
bustle that seemed his only
pace of movement, wiping his
hands on his apron. He eyed
the union man shrewdly.
“What you questioning my
girl about, eh, Mr. Rogan?”
“Questioning? I was just
talking to her.”
“Asking me who you had out
the back,” the Happy Dump-
ling helped.
The Greek leaned across the
table. “And what she tell you?”
“She said you were by
yourself.”
‘-Then why you’re not mind-
ing your own business!”
Rogan drew back. “Don’t
talk to me that way, Enakis.”
The Greek brushed the words
off scornfully. “Coming round
here when we all got work to
do. Wasting everybody’s time.”
His tongue licked over his lips.
“Why not minding your own
business? Or you want my boy
Costa in the bloody union, too?
He’s thirteen; you can train
him well. Sign the time-book,
sign the wages-book, tell the
boss what to do ; only no work.
Never do any bloody work! ”
Rogan had jumped up, tib
dancing in sallow face. “I
know Arn Patton’s working for
you. And we’ll prosecute,
Enakis! We'll make you pay.
Just because you get a few quid
you think you can run us
around, but you’ll pay,
Enakis! ”
The dark girl spoke her first
words of the day.' They came
in a venomous rush. “You’re
right, Mr. Rogan. ’Course he’s
got Patton doing the fish ; had
him here ten minutes before
you came.”
The Greek looked as though
he would strike her. His
wife waddle-rushed to his side.
They spoke quickly in Greek,
then he reverted to English.
“Like a little rat . . . nibble
here, nibble there. Work
sixteen hours a day for a little
rat to nibble.”
He dug a roll of notes from
a pocket, slipped off a few and
gave them to the girl. “Go
put your coat on.”
Rogan was going, too. “I’ve
got what I came for, Enakis.
You can’t push union-
secretaries around the way you
push your staff.”
“Get out or I cut your bloody
throat,” said the Greek tiredly,
the balling-up starting again.
XJIS wife went out to help
Costa with the flounders.
A cut with the knife to remove
the head, a nick below that
big enough for a thumb to dig
in between skin and flesh, then
pressure down to the tail, lifting
the skin free before the thumb.
The tail-skin was freed, then
pulled backwards, ripping
cleanly from the whole fish.
Mother and son worked quietly,
efficiently, then
“Aaark! ” she screamed.
Costa saw the crimsoned hand,
went pale and vomited.
The Greek was there before
the screams ended, washing
water on the wound the knife
had made down thumb and
palm, binding it with a tea-
towel as his wife followed
Costa at the open drain.
Costa fook over the shop
and the till for the dinner-rush.
The Greek’s wife struggled
one-handedly with the dishes.
“Steakneggs again for two,
one underdone . . . fish, two
. . . tomatoes on that single
steak, please . . . fish for three
—that's five fish now . . .”/
The Greek danced between
stoves and vats in a cloud of
steam, hammering steaks with
a knife-handle, cutting onions
and tomatoes, filling baskets
from the great trays and putting
them into the vats, arranging
food on heated plates. He
changed a £lO-note for Costa,
bustled out to the refrigerator,
dealt with a phone-call from
the Egg Board manager (“Wife
on the way down for it; yes,
just two pieces—only the two
of us now”).
TT was a bad time for the
truckie to bring a quarrel
with his light-o’-love to the boil.
“Why in hell should I?” Big
voice boomed round the dining-
room. “Go on, why the hell
should 1?”
An evening shower had
drenched them coming up from
the hotel and the woman was
using a whisper of a hanky to
dry a full, indecisive face.
Misery had made it slop like
warmed butter, just as the rain
had made its colors run. The
snap of pride that could have
done something with her bold
body was missing and it was
just fettered flesh in cheap
cotton trappings.
She looked about, em-
barrassed, as he spoke.
“Why me?” he continued.
“Why pick me out of the
bundle? Take Jimmy Shannon,
Pete Leslie; you want a mark,

then go ahead. You got
hundreds to pick from.”
“Please don’t . . . not here!
Please.” It was not all rain
on the puddled face.
The truckie looked upwards.
“Whaddya want, mate?”
“The noise,” said the Greek.
“Too much noise for my
customers.”
“You’d make a noise too if
this harlot tried to put it on
you.”
The woman shushed at him.
“Ned . . . Ned, let’s get out of
here.”
The Greek wiped his hands
on his apron. The truckie
made a show of unconcerned
eating.
“You will be quieter then?”
Quite softly.
The truckie looked up in
ludicrous surprise: scaramouch
bellying the scene out to its
fullest. “You still here, mate?”
He waved his knife negligently.
“Go on now, hop it. Hop it
quick before I sneeze on you.”
“Ned! I’m going! ” She
started to rise but a hand
pushed her back in the chair.
“You sit where you are!
And you, mate —buzz off!”
The Greek’s voice was a hiss.
“Get the police, Isabel.”
“Copper’s nark! ” The
truckie rose. “Dob a chap in
just like that.” He appealed
to the dining-room. “How’s
his flipping form? Dobber-in
Number One.” One great hand
reached out, grapped the
Greek and pulled him in.
The truckie towered over the
cafe-proprietor. “All the same,
you stinkin’ Wops, all the
flipping”
The Greek’s knee came up
with vicious swiftness, and as
the big man doubled the Greek
chopped hard, shatteringly,
with the side of his hand
against the'truckie’s nose. The
man went back into a chair in
a boneless slump. Pain and
bewilderment gave way to
snarling rage.
But the Greek’s all-wrong
day had caught up with him,
swept through him, possessed
him in one second of furious,
killing hatred. Muddled
orders, Costa’s backchat, the
pains, Rogan, the dark girl,
the accident, work. Work for
any tramp with five-bob in his
pockets if you have to on
your belly to the stoves!
The sauce-bottle smashed
across the truckie’s face and
he was on his knees, howling
from a mess of blood and
sauce, crawling directionless
with his pain. The Greek
kicked swift, toe pointed,
hard, into the shambling body.
Again he kicked: at the
battered face. There was a
grunting expulsion of wind —
but not from the truckie.
Costa lay unmoving where
he had flung himself between
the men.
Then the Greek could no
longer shrug off the men leap-
ing at him: “Take it easy,
Greek! You’d have killed the
poor soandso.”
Dumbly he watched his wife
being helped to take the boy
away. The sergeant was there
and they were all telling him
at once how the truckie
assaulted the Greek.
AFTERWARDS he sat
alone, trembling, in the
kitchen. There was a thought
darting round the wall of
dumbness looking for a chink
to get through and urge him
to the boy’s side, but finding
none yet. He spilled makings
on the table and swept them
to the floor.
Now one needle of thought
got through: the pain was on
the way back.
He looked at the girl for a
while before recognising her.
“Yes?”
“I just wanted to say I'm
sorry it happened.” Uncertain
of her reception, ready to run.
At last he shrugged. “It
has happened.” A longer
silence, then, “You got a
job?”
“No, I . . It trailed
away.
Hands washed across the
greyed foam-rubber, over the
bald head. “You want to work
in the pantry, there is job for
you.”
“Thank you . . . but . . .
Well, I’m going to have a
kid.”
He eyed the wet dress, dark
eyes, stringy hair, wispy
desolation, the kickaround
marks.
“There is the missus and me
here. And the boy. We have
room if you want.”
The boy ... He led the
woman through to where his
wife was nursing the wakening
Costa. The knives were churn-
ing and stabbing and there was
no bustle now.
Before they went through
the door he took off the soiled
apron, rolled it slowly and then
abruptly threw it away from
him as though it were a dirty
thought.
The bedroom was heavily
carpeted. Big oils that seemed
all deep gold and blue and
green hung on the walls. The
bed was a huge, richly covered
squab. Soft pink lighting
emphasised the room’s exotic
tastefulness.
The woman looked about at
the luxury they had walked to,
one door away from rush,
steam, heat and cursing. She
moved over to one corner,
across which a shelf had been
recessed into the smooth peach
walls. A ruby-red sanctuary-
lamp, the kanthila, burned on
the shelf. Above it was an
icon, a New Testament scene,
and the shadows of the recess
and the tiny light played with
it for an effect of movement in
the faces of the disciples.
The Greek looked up from
the boy as she moved a hand
out to the picture and he spoke
urgently: “Do not touch it,
please! ”
She drew the hand back
without knowing why she had
extended it. He moved to her.
“It looks so beaut. 1 mean,
it’s so lovely, isn’t it!”
He looked at it a long
time, lips moving, before he
answered. “Yes, the icon. Is
most lovely thing, the icon ..
XJE was speaking about
another icon in another
bedroom in another land.
He saw a boy run laughing
from that other house into
the bright diamond of a day
and over the hill and down
the rough white track. The
boy ran on and on, tireless as
a spring wind, past the shops
and through the market and
along the beach with its
hissing, bubbling, pattering
wavelets that laughed with him,
and on to the jetty and out to
the trawler, skinny legs
buckling as he jumped down
to its decking.
The fishermen were bearded,
joyous men, and they laughed
as men do whose hold is full
of fine fish, and they tossed
the boy one to the other until
his shouts and struggles and
laughs left him without wind,
and then from the cabin came
another man, and he hugged
the breathless boy hard and
lifted him up and looked at
him and hugged him hard
again.
They left the boat, the man
and the boy, and they walked
back to the village; and the
man spoke to friends in the
markets, enthusiastically boast-
ing about the catch ; and at
the cafe he drank a little ouzo,
swinging the glass away from
his mouth on an outstretched
arm, thumping the back of his
other hand on someone’s chest
to emphasise a point. Then off
again up the steep white road,
both running now, for they
saw the woman coming down
toward them.
They gathered up her mock
dignity in their whirl of happi-
ness, dancing around her,
embracing and pinching her,
festooning her with foolishness
to see her laugh.
And later, in the cozy dark-
ness of the small house
wrapped in wood-smoke smells
they gathered before the icon
framed in hard twisty wood
the man had taken from the
sea and cut and polished to
gleaming blackness. The man
placed incense on the little
glow of charcoal in the therebul
and they gave thanks for the
fish, and for the smooth sea
and good weather, and for their
life . . .
And in the far-off other
land the man looking at the
other icon repeated himseif
without knowing he had
spoken:
“Is most nice thing, the
icon.”

A Rachel Henning postscript
John Mills's Diary
[ln previous instalments John
tUills described his first and second
visits to The Mount, in Taunton,
Somerset, where . his friend John
tester was staying- with the
Pinchards, relatives of Rachel
Henning. In this instalment John
Mills continues with the descrip-
tion of his third visit to The Mount
to attend the wedding of John
Pester to Rose Biddulph, a cousin
of RacheUs staying with the
Pinchards. He also describes a
later visit to attend the wedding
of Edwin Arnold, the poet, and
Kate Biddulph.]
The Marriage of John Lester
and Rose Biddulph
August 1, 1854. —My birth-
day and John Lester's wedding-
day. Mrs. Pinchard had decided
upon breaking through the
usual etiquette (that the bride
and bridegroom do not meet
on the eventful morning until
they meet at church), artd had
arranged that they should meet
a few of the most intimate
friends in the drawing-room at
8 a.m. for prayers, and she
most kindly invited me to be
one of the number.
Lester and I, sent to The
Mount at half-past-seven, found
another addition to the party,
an uncle of Lester's, the Rev.
Mr. Barne.
We got some coffee, etc., in
the little front room and then
Mr. and Mrs. Pinchard, Lester
and Rose, Mr. Reeve, Mr.
Barne and myself went in the
drawing-room for prayers. Mr.
B. read the 103rd Psalm, said
a few words on it, and then
gave a prayer most appropriate
to the occasion.
At nine-o’clock we started for
church in seven carriages.
There were eight bridesmaids
—Kate (1) and Rachel (2) Bid-
dulph ; Bella (3) and Georgie
(4) Badcock ; Annie Wadding-
ton (5); Annie Doveton (6);
Miss Fraser (7); and Annie
Trenchard (8) —uniform white
muslin and pink ribbons.
Eight groomsmen—Biddulph
(6) and Theophilus (5) Pinch-
ard ; Tregenna Biddulph (3);
Mr. Arnold (1); Mr. Malden
(4) ; Horace Waddington (8);
Mr. Sheil (2); myself (7);
paired-off as numbered.
In the first carriage were
Mrs. Pinchard and Lester;
second, Mrs. Waddington, Mr.
Russell Gurney, Mr. Reeve
and Mr. Barne ; then four car-
riages containing the brides-
maids and groomsmen ; and in
the last, largo intervallo, the
bride and Mr. Pinchard.
As we got to the church we
walked up the aisle two-and-
two tiU'we got to the chancel,
where the ladies took one side,
the gentlemen the other, and
the bride and her uncle walked
through to the communion
rails.
Mr. Parr, being in bad
health, cut short the service
very much so that, after a little
meeting in the vestry, we got
back to The Mount before 10.
About half-past we sat down
to breakfast.
Mr. Parr could not come.
Mr. Barne proposed the health
of the bride and bridegroom in
a very nice speech. Then
Lester proposed his uncle and
aunt. Mr. Pinchard proposed
the bridesmaids, for whom
Theophilus returned thanks —
and proposed the groomsmen,
Biddulph Pinchard returning
thanks for us. Then he pro-
posed the engaged, for whom
I had to return.
Mr. Arnold returned thanks
for the unengaged, and lastly
Theophilus proposed the
married. I think Mr. Trenchard
returned.
The bride was very hand-
somely dressed in a rich
figured white silk with a very
large and handsome veil. The
bridesmaids were in white mus-
lin and pink and looked very
nice.
After breakfast we adjourned
to the drawing-room to bid
good-bye. The bride and
bridegroom started about half-
past-12, and then Mr. Barne
invited all present to pray for
them, and gave a very short but
beautiful prayer.
Then all separated till 3 p.m.
1 went with the two clergymen.
Mr. Barne apparently an
excellent man.
Then I saw Malden take a
couple of pholographs of St.
Mary's (he does the waxed-
paper process) and then 1 wrote
to my darling.
At 3 we dined, and, immedi-
ately after, a large party, 36 in
all, various vehicles, started
.for a beautiful place in the
woods near Orchard Portman,
five miles off. Here we had a
picnic tea and spent the rest
of the day delightfully.
It was a sweet spot, and the
sunset was most beautiful. The
view of the Mendips, with
Glastonbury Tower, etc., and
the tints of the sky as the sun
sank will long be remembered
by many of us, as will all the
proceedings of this day.
The only sorrowful feature
was poor Tregenna Biddulph
and Bella Badcock, her father
refusing to allow them to be
married or even to consider
themselves to be engaged, now
that Tregenna is going to Aus-
tralia, tho’ as to not consider-
ing themselves engaged, that is
absurd, for he says, if Tregenna

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL-RUM
V.R.C.
Following his ridiculously
easy win in last Saturday’s Vic-
toria Derby, Tulloch can be
safely rated the greatest colt
ever to race in Australasia.
As he placed the coveted sash
around Tulloch’s neck Vic-
toria’s sporting Governor,
Sir Dallas Brooks, recently back
from England, termed the colt
“champion of champions.”
And jockey George Moore
stated: “Tulloch is the greatest
three-year-old in the world.”
In the Derby the champion
raced kindly close to the lead
until the straight entrance,
where Moore let him have his
head. Galloping at his top for
perhaps a furlong, Tulloch put
eight lengths between himself
and the field, an advantage he
maintained effortlessly to the
line.
The Derby first-prize of
£4900 took Tulloch’s earnings
to £45,432 10s., and after his
spring campaign he should
return in the autumn to add the
St. Legers and a string of
w.-f.-a. races to his tally. He
has now raced 19 times for 13
wins and six seconds. As a
three-year-old he has had six
starts for as many wins.
Tulloch goes into the record
books as the 35th dual A.J.C.-
Victoria Derbys winner. At
10 to 1 on, he is the shortest-
priced favorite to have won the
Victorian classic, which dates to
1855. And he is the only horse
ever to win the two Derbys, the
Caulfield Guineas and Caulfield
Cup in the one year.
Victorian racegoers, who
dearly love Sailor’s Guide for
his courage and honesty, gave
the Bendigo horse a tumultuous
reception - when he outstayed
Syntax in the L. K. S. Mac-
kinnon Stakes. Ron Hutchin-
son’s tactics played a big part
in Sailor’s win. Realising that
Syntax, who had been out of
action for some weeks, might
be wanting in condition,
Hutchinson took Sailor’s Guide
to the lead from the barrier,
and set the. New Zealander the
task of running him down.
Two furlongs out, Williamson
sooled Syntax after the leader,
but, while his mount responded
valiantly, Sailor’s Guide was
too fit on the day.
It was Sailor’s Guide’s 14th
win from 47 starts, in which he
has earned a handsome £51,544.
The Bendigo horse is still as
sound as a bell, and should
have plenty of opportunities to
add to those stake-earnings.
In recent years Sydney-
trained entrants have dominated
the Maribyrnong Plate, but last
Saturday the two Sydney
representatives, Mighty King-
dom and the filly Andabri, who
started first and second favorites
in the race, turned in poor
performances to finish well
down the running. The race
went to Sandhurst, who is
clearly the best youngster seen
out this season. He ran record
time for the event —59sec. The
Bob Major (imp.) colt is chock-
full of promise. Saturday’s win
was his third in four starts. The
most pleasing feature of his
form is that, while he can
match the speediest youngsters
for pace, he gives every indica-
tion of being able to stay as
he matures. His sire was a
good distance-performer, and
his dam was out of Oaks
winner East End. It was
mentioned here last week that
no Maribyrnong Plate winner
had in later years won a Caul-
field or Melbourne Cup. Sand-
hurst may be capable of even
those heights.
• • • •
Tomorrow (Thursday) is
Oaks Day at Flemington, and
it will be surprising if last
Saturday’s 10-furlongs Wakeful
Stakes did not offer a preview
of the fillies classic. Sent out
a 9-to-4-on favorite, Amneris
won the Wakeful very easily
from another Sydney-trained
filly, Goldenway. When the
pair last met, in the One
Thousand Guineas during the
Caulfield Cup meeting, Golden-
way’s early pace won the day ;
the extra two furlongs of the
Wakeful were all in favor of
Amneris, and in the run along
the straight she finished much
too strongly for her rival. The
mile and a half of the Oaks
should be even more palatable
for Amneris, who is a daughter
of imported Nilo, whose sire,
Nearco, was unbeaten —his
mariy wins included the Italian
Derby and Grand Prix de
Paris.
• •; •
Lionel Israel, of Segenhoe
Stud, Scone (N.S.W.), declined
2600gns. for Amneris at the
Randwick yearling-sales last
year, but he accepted 1175gns.
for her yearling sister at last
April’s auction, the youngster
being purchased for a Brisbane
client.
The Oaks was inaugurated
in the same year as the Mel-
bourne Cup, 1861. Fillies in
the race carry 8.10, which gives
added merit to the time-record
for the event, 2.30}, set by
In the Hotham Handicap
six-year-old New Zealander
Baron Boissier put up an
excellent performance to share
the lead for most of the journey
with Gallant Lee and then
bound away in the straight
and hold off all challenges. Mel
Schumacher had the mount on
Baron Boissier, and his success
completed a good day for visit-
ing riders, who won five of the
seven events on the programme.
Session in 1940, which time is
only half a second outside
Advocate’s Victoria Derby
record. Last year’s Melbourne
Cup winner, Evening Peal,
took the Oaks in 1955.
• • • •
Bobby Lewis, who had the
best riding record in the Mel-
bourne Cup, also had a
remarkable record in the Oaks,
winning the race seven times.
Frank Dempsey, who will start
tomorrow’s race, rode four
Oaks winners.
George Moore completed a
Derby Day treble when he
took the mile Cantala Stakes
on Landy. When betting
opened on the Cantala there
was not much difference in the
quotes about Landy and the
South Australian Matrice, but
followers of T. J. Smith’s stable
sent the Sydney horse out a
short-priced favorite. Matrice
tried to run his rival off his
legs, but he found his welter
weight of 10.2 too much, and
Landy had little trouble to
pick him up in the run home.
• • • •
At the time of writing the
pair were due to meet again
in the mile Linlithgow Stakes
at w.f.a. tomorrow (Thursday),
when Matrice would meet
Landy with an advantage of
81b. campared with the Cantala
weights, and that difference
could reverse last Saturday’s
placings.
Feature race on Saturday
will be the £5OOO C. B. Fisher
Plate, and at time of writing
it was expected that Tulloch
would be in it. If so, he should
certainly add the £3500 first-
prize to his stake-total.

printer when the smallish field
got away for the big Cup, so
comment stands over till next

Missing Beneficiary
IN the Estate of JOHN BERTHOLD
ALBERT FERGUSON, late of 25
Torrens Road, Alberton, in the State
of South Australia, Labourer, deceased.
—By DIRECTION of the Supreme Court
of South Australia NOTICE is hereby
given, pursuant to The Trustee Act
1936-1953 that ISAAC FERGUSON, at
some time resident at Black Hill in
South Australia, or his children or per-
sonal representative, is or are within
60 days after the date of insertion of
this Notice, to ’send by prepaid post to
PUBLIC TRUSTEE, of Hindmarsh
Square, Adelaide, South Australia, the
Administrator of the estate of the
abovenamed JOHN BERTHOLD
ALBERT FERGUSON deceased, an intes-
tate, full particulars of any claim the
said Isaac Ferguson has or had to share
in the estate of the said John Berthold
Albert Ferguson deceased as the father
and next-of-kin of the said John Bert-
hold Albert Ferguson deceased, other-
wise he or they will be excluded from
the distribution of the said estate.
N.B.—ISAAC FERGUSON is believed
to have been born in Scotland in about
1854, and lived in South Australia from
about 1883 to about 1893, and was a
shipwright by trade. —E. P. JIeUEE,
Solicitor for Public Trustee.
would win prizes in any show-
ring, but his turf record is
nothing to write home about.
Connections forgot to bet or
had no intention of backing the
handsome chestnut, who
sported blinkers in the race.
But, though he eased to 15 to 1,
the big son of Dhoti ran race-
record time, 1.23|, beating by
a quarter of a second Sunny
Hour’s time v made in 1954.
Poor form at earlier starts had
brought Indian Empire down
to the limit in the weights.
Trainer E. Fellows paid
2000gns. for King Lazar at the
Randwick yearling - sales last
autumn. Bred at Phen Buen
Stud, Scone (N.S.W.), the
Jambo (imp.) colt is another
good looker, and is from the
Dhoti (imp.) mare Belgrade,
whose dam, Caeira, was by
Beau Fils (imp.). King Lazar
belongs to a family of winners ;
his closest relatives have all
won races. He was restive in
the barrier-stalls and lost a
couple of teeth, but that didn't
prevent him winning in brilliant
style. He had started once
before, finishing third to Man
of Iron and Regal Jester at
Randwick a fortnight earlier,
and Regal Jester had meantime
won at the Warwick Farm
midweek meeting.
Three moderate prior dis-
plays were no inducement for
the stable to support two-year-
old Flying Kwinana, narrow
winner of the Two-year-old
Maiden for fillies at Rosehill.
Trained by Jack Daniels for his
wife, the filly eased to 66’s, but
firmed slightly through spas-
modic bets to 50 lo 1. The
£715 prize put Flying Kwinana
on the credit side ; her cost as
a yearling last April was 500gns.
Her sire, Bob Cherry (imp.),
also sired Hurst, winner of the
final event, the Welter Handi-
cap. Jesterine, dam of Flying
Kwinana, is a sister to the
former speedster Trimmer, and
herself won races on Sydney
tracks.
Randwick trainer Maurice
McCarten, who had no luck in
Melbourne with Mighty King-
dom (winner at his two Sydney
starts, but out of a place in the
Maribyrnong Plate), used to
train three of the winners at
Rosehill Calculator, Hurst
and Indian Empire. Calcu-
lator’s present trainer, Jack
Denham, has now won five
races with the gelding, whom
he purchased for £BOO. Calcu-
lator, who managed only a
couple of minor places in 15
starts for his previous mentor,
has had only seven starts for
his five wins for Denham. But
that’s racing! He won the First
Parramatta Stakes in fine style,
but supporters of the short-
priced favorite, Prince Atlas,
handed no bouquets to his
apprentice rider, D. Pritchard.
Within six weeks, Hurst, now
trained by A. J. Lyell, has had
five starts for three wins, a
second and a third, and is still
improving. His first success
was in a Canterbury Maiden
Handicap, and on October 19
be won the Randwick Schactel
Handicap.
• «T 1 •
Though Grand Charles does
his training at Randwick —his
mentor is former successful
amateur rider Les Quinlan —he
has won seven races at Rose-
hill, mostly Rosehill Handi-
caps. Latest of the series was
last Saturday’s main event, in
which he started at odds-on.
He had sone up in the weights,
but aeam came from the
of the field and outclassed his
four opponents. It’s now
intended to give the six-year-
old entire a brief rest, then get
him ready for the A.J.C.
Summer Cup. in which the
opposition won’t be strong.
Superbly, now a five-year-
old, won his first race when
he landed Rosehill’s Second
Parramatta Stakes, and it gave
apprentice J. Hampton his
first city success. Hampton
took no chances; he sent the
gelding to the front after going
a couple of furlongs, then rode
him hard to the finish. Superbly
is by Wayside Inn (imp.), sire of
Grand Charles, and is from
Dark Elegance by El Cacique
(imp.). He cost 1500gns. as a
yearling in 1954.
Coronia, dam of Regal
Jester, easy winner of Warwick
Farm Juvenile Maiden for
colts and geldings, is a
daughter of Feminist, a winner
of the Metropolitan and of
Tattersall’s Cup. Regal Jester,
form horse of the race, had an
easy task beating a modest field.
The colt is by Rigoletto (imp.),
a winner in England at up to
-1{ mile. Regal Jester’s half-
brothers Avonair and Pleasure
Cruise won a number of races
at N. S. Wales country meet-
ings. Coronia’s sister, Ann-
Tein-Et, brought a high price,
4500gn5., as a yearling some
years ago, but her racing
record was of little account.
Bred by E. N. Larkin, of

(N.S.W.), Infanta, winner of
Warwick Farm Two-year-old
Maiden for fillies, cost owner
Mrs. A. R. Rial 1050gns.
as a yearling at the Randwick
auction last autumn. The filly
showed promise at her prior
start by finishing third at
Canterbury to Brendie. She is
one of Bill Kelso’s team and
was well fancied by the stable.
The filly is by Emperor (imp.)
from Elusive by Brueghel (It.).
Elusive won the Adrian Knox
Stakes and other races.
Infanta was her second foal.
After a run of weak efforts,
A. O. Romano’s Bernfield
rejoined the winning-list by
narrowly defeating the pace-
maker, Sales Boy, in Warwick
Farm’s Burragorang Handicap,
in which three others were
preferred in betting to the
four-year-old Bossier gelding.
Last season Bernfield won a
couple of restricted events at
Rosehill immediately prior to
the running of the A.J.C.
Derby, and was then given a
good show in the classic, but
Monte Carlo proved too solid
for him. Bernfield was later
unplaced in the V.R.C. Derby,
but filled third place in the
A.J.C. St. Leger, again to
Monte Carlo. Harry Plant,
trainer of Bernfield, also won
the First Warragamba Stakes

Cricket
The Australian tourists com-
fortably won their first first-
class game in South Africa by
an innings (against Rhodesia
at Salisbury). Features of the
game: a neat century by Craig
(which he followed by a round
100 in the second game v.
Rhodesia); hurricane centuries
by those two hitters Benaud
and Davidson (with the local
Jessop, Test-batsman Winslow,
also getting right among ’em,
81 and 139); and good bowling-
efforts by Drennan and Benaud.
Queensland was clearly the
better side in its first-innings
win over N.S.W. in the opening
Shield game. It just missed
an outright; time ran-out when
N.S.W. batsman Martin looked
likely to run out of partners.
Features of the game, apart
from Martin’s 79 not-out:
young Queensland opener Ray
Reynolds’s eight-hour 174 —
he should be a fixture in the
side for a long while ; “old
man” spin - bowler Wal
Walmsley’s century (and, with
his participation in both of
them, a century-partnership for
each of the last two wickets —
something rare in first-class
cricket, or any cricket) ; good
bowling by all the Northern
trundlers, not least by Lind-
wall ; and N.S.W. skipper
Carroll’s fine second-innings 75.
(Walmsley figured in two ninth-
wicket century - partnerships
last season, getting his share of
the runs, too —must constitute
a record of sorts for a No. 10
batsman.)
“Kejokada”: Against Foot-

when Melb. skipper Clive
Fairbairn withdrew through
injury. Last “full hand” in
Melbourne pennant-cricket was
in Feb., 1938, when former

bowler Laurie Nash took 10-35
for South Melbourne against

North Melbourne (V.F.L.)

football side which toured S.A.
and W.A. this year.
The other is 21-year-old
Lindsay Head, who has just
made a most impressive debut
for S. A. against W. A.
Picked without playing a game
in district-cricket this season,
Head is a dashing batsman with
Phil Ridings’s team, West
Torrens; he is also West
Torrens and S.A. half-forward,
and was one of S.A.’s best foot-
ballers in the two games against
Victoria this year. He won the
Magarey Medal (for S.A.’s
best-and-fairest player) in 1955.
“Veryl”: St. George won
this year’s Sydney Rugby
Union, Rugby League and
hockey premierships. It could
add the 1957-58 cricket premier-
ship. The Saints have the
talent, particularly in the
batting Watson, O’Neill,
Saunders, Booth and O’Reilly
are a formidable batting line-
up for one grade team. Of
course, the State might make
too heavy a call—there were
five from St. George in the 12

Failh in llic
Future
One of the most constructive proposals I have
heard in years—thinking of Australia’s develop-
ment —is that five leading shipping companies have
been considering a road transport project to
co-ordinate land services with the shipping they
provide along the coast.
It is refreshing to have new ideas brought to
bear on Australia’s knotty transport problem. Sea
and land and air will have to play their increasingly
connected part in its solution.
Take, for example, the States of Queensland
and New South Wales. Between them they cover
one-third of Australia’s land area. In their
coastline—3ooo miles in Queensland. 700 miles
in N.S.W.—they reach round one-third of our
continental seaboard.
For all their bulk and industry-in-depth, they
are maritime States. Shipping, no less than railways
or roads, is life to them. It will always be so,
however the ships may be powered in days
to come. And shipping along the whole Australian
coast has languished—for a variety of reasons,
including costs.
Well, whether by this latest proposal or
some other means, shipping will have to be
stimulated if we are to work out the balances of
our development.
But the application of fresh thought to
Australia’s transport needs does not end with
shipping, or with road services to connect
productive centres with the ports. There is the
urgency of roads in all directions—for the interior,
as well as on the coastal fringe.
Roads are going to require all the financial -
strength we can gather; more, it seems, than
will be available from Government revenue or
loan funds.
Before the road requirements are satisfied it
may be necessary to revive the system of toll
franchises for construction of some of the mileage,
Queensland, in fact, legislated for such a
system more than 25 years ago, but a succeeding
Government abolished it before it had a chance
to operate.
In the light of present and future needs, I
believe the toll system for certain road works may
merit close consideration now.

Would sawdust be a satisfactory
insulator for the water-tank of a
solar-heater ?
Sawdust is not a very satisfactory
insulator unless it is baked perfectly
ary, sprayed with a good insecticide
such as D.D.T., or similar liquid,
and sealed so that it is proof
against any moisture. It is inclined
to attract moisture, which sets up
mould and deterioration. Ground-
up pumice is excellent, but probably
difficult to procure. Inquire into the
merits of some of the fibre or block
insulating-materials often advertised
for roofs and walls; these would
probably suit your purpose.

(1) In what conditions ( climate,
soil, etc.) does the olive grow best ?
(2) Life of an olive-tree ? (3) What
types of olive are most suitable for
the making of olive-oil ? (4)
Methods of extracting the oil? (5)
Yield of oil per tree ?
(1) The olive needs good rainfall,
plenty of warm summer sunshine
and bracing winter cold. It does
not do well in climatic extremes. It
prefers rich, deep soil—though not
waterlogged or saline ground. It
likes decomposed granitic soil,
such as is typical of the Grampians
foothills (Vic.). (2) Olive-trees are
very hardy, and in Mediterranean
countries have been known to bear,
year in, year out, for hundreds of
years. (3) Almost every oiive is
suitable except the Queen olive,
which has little oil-content and is
almost always used for the table.
(4) Method varies according to
acreage cultivated. If the acreage
is small (as, apparently, in your
case) a small crusher comprising two
granite wheels, along with a hand-
press, would suffice. (Cost of this
installation, approx. £1000.) (5)
Hard to say, as trees bear different
quantities each year. At maturity
a tree should average about 2001 b.
of olives annually. It takes 401 b-
. of olives to make a gallon
of oil.

(1) Why do vines, such as climb-
ing-beans, wind round a support in
an anti-clockwise direction ? (2)
Any information re whirlpools in
running water ?
(1) Scientists of many times have
studied this subject; it received
much attention from Charles
Darwin, among others. The true
causes are still not exactly known,
but generally speaking it is con-
sidered that many plants are
attracted to the greatest and most
powerful light-rays from the sun,
early in the day. Roots also are
considered to be sensitive to out-
side causes. The subject is known
as circumnutation, and under the
heading of “Plants” can be further
studied in your public library. (2)
Caused by the meeting of two
opposing currents, not necessarily
opposite; the stronger turns the
weaker. The currents themselves
may be caused by rocks or other
obstructions, or by banks of
different levels on each side of a
stream.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
ANGLO-U.S. RELATIONS
YS7TTH Anglo - American
** relations at the heart of
British foreign policy, and with
British Labor optimistic about
the next elections, Aneurin
Bevan’s views on the ties
between John Bull and Uncle
Sam are of particular interest.
As was noted here last
week, Mr. Bevan already
appears to be tailoring his
politics to suit the responsi-
bilities of the Foreign
Secretaryship and paying some
attention to American opinion,
which, not so long ago, was
hardly favorable towards him.
In the following article,
published in the U.S. quarterly
“Foreign Affairs” just before
Mr. Bevan’s current visit to
America, he makes a significant
attempt to effect a compromise
between divergent British and
U.S. views and, incidentally, an
astute political point in draw-
ing attention to British Labor’s
sympathy with Uncle Sam's
Suez policy:
“When the war ended Anglo-
American relations were at
their best. In ruling Conserva-
tive circles they continued at
this level for some years,-but
among the masses - of the
people, then devoted to the
cause of Labor, criticism of
American policy began to be
heard with increasing fre-
quency. The abrupt ending of
Lend-Lease by the Truman
Administration was felt to be
a bitter blow intended to injure
the British Labor Government
by hurting the British people.
World War II
“During the war a division
of labor had been worked out
between the two countries by
which we went on building
ships and bombers while
America concentrated mainly
on supply-planes and merchant-
ships. The supply-planes and
the ships could be quickly
converted to peace-time uses ;
but not the tanks or the
bombers or the battleships.
Britain’s export trade, so vital
to her economy, had been
virtually extinguished for six-
and-a-half years and had to
be painfully rebuilt ; whilst
America, with a relatively tiny
export trade, had been able to
maintain most of it in the
expanding Americas. At the
same time, Britain had suffered
grievous material damage by
air raids and from guided-
missiles. One-third of her
homes had either been
damaged or destroyed outright.
I myself was keenly conscious
of the magnitude of the task
this involved, because for six
years I was the Minister

TIME FOR A MEETING AT THE SUMMIT.
responsible for housing as well
as health.
“The economies of both
countries were closely inter-
locked while they were being
built into the war effort. The
consequence of this projected
itself far into the peace-time
years. Disentanglement was a
difficult and painful process for
Britain, but of no significant
consequence to the United
States. The abrupt ending of
Lend-Lease was, in these
circumstances, a sharp, indeed
almost a mortal, blow to
British prospects of recovery.
I understand that Mr. Truman
now believes that this action
was a mistake. I recall it now,
not for the purpose of
recrimination but in order that
American readers may under-
stand one, at least, of the
‘reasons for British coldness
towards America. This cold-
ness was, of course, partly dis-
persed by the imaginative
generosity of Marshall aid.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to
appreciate that charity, how-
ever lavish, is no substitute for
justice.
Economic Differences
“At this point it may be well
to make an observation which
is not usually emphasised
sufficiently. The American
and British economic systems
are not complementary to each
other. Britain and the United
States are not the natural
markets for each other’s goods.
They are both highly indus-
trialised countries. The goods
they produce in the main com-
pete with each other. The
natural markets for the exports
from Britain are to be found,
in most cases, in the under-
developed countries. Most of
these, at least in the years
immediately following the war,
were either in the throes of
political convulsions or, like
China, Russia and her Eastern
satellites, had come completely
under Communist control.
Even Russia remains a com-
paratively underdeveloped
country, in spite of her
astonishing industrial progress
within recent years.
“All this adds up to a signifi-
cant conclusion for which
inadequate allowance often is
made in attempts to analyse
the complex relationship be-
tween Britain and America.
Britain has been in close
political alliance with the
United States, to which her
economy is not similarly
married, and she has been
estranged diplomatically and
militarily from those areas of
the world most suited to her
economic destinies.
“Thus we have economic
interest pointing one way and
diplomatic involvements in
another. If all ideological
considerations were dismissed
British diplomacy should fol-
low her material needs. But,
of course, they cannot be dis-
missed. The fact that her
ideological affiliations and her
economic interests tend to tug
Britain in opposite directions is
a fact that should be recog-
nised and for which allowance
must be made if we are to act
intelligently.
Britain’s Shrinking Markets
“It is not often in the history
of nations that long-term
economic trends and needs fail
to find corresponding expres-
sion in diplomatic policy. That
this has not been the case with
British policy in recent years
is a remarkable tribute to the
strength of the Anglo-American
alliance. Jf the Kremlin had
not been so obtuse and mala-
droit it could have made much
more of this. On the other
hand, if Washington and the
American people understood it
more fully, and realised its
implications, certain American
policies might have been
modified.
“Britain’s trade and com-
merce were caught at the end
of the war and have been held
since in an unnatural clamp.
Her financial and economic
recovery has been partly frus-
trated. The outlets for her
exports have either been silted
up or blocked, distorted and
diverted in a way which has
impaired her vigor and enter-
prise.
“In spite of the economic
enfeeblement resulting from all
this, she [Britain] accepted,
largely under United States
pressure, a crippling burden of
arms. It is true that the United
States, from time to time, came
to her assistance in various

□ Placa X In tquarm If for tchool pro/ocf
ways, but as I once remarked
to Mr. Lewis Douglas when
he was Ambassador in London,
“the British were getting tired
of American dollars being
pushed into pockets from
which the bottoms had been
cut by American policies.”
The foreign - exchange crises
which have occurred so fre-
quently in Britain since the
end of the war are but the
symptoms and expressions of
these underlying economic
distortions.
“I am not contending that
the economy of Britain should
be interlocked with that of the
Soviet world. That might well
prove disastrous. It would
have made her far too
dependent on Communist
foreign policy, which is always
prepared to apply economic
sanctions, as happened in 1948
in the case of Yugoslavia. But
it is a far cry from that position
to cutting off Britain’s expan-
sion almost completely from
those parts of the world
economically most suitable to
her trade.
China and Germany
“A particular illustration of
this is the policy of the United
States towards China. To the
British it just does not make
sense. It is causing bad blood
in British business circles as
well as among those whom
Americans would describe as
radicals. It is easy for the
British to understand and
sympathise with the emotional
overtones involved. American
soldiers were killed by the
Chinese in Korea. It is there-
fore understandable that
American opinion cannot
easily be brought to the
resumption of norrqal trade
relations with China. But
when we set against that the
American policy towards Ger-
many it becomes difficult for
us to understand this one-sided
emotionalism,
“America insists on helping
Western Germany, arming her
and bringing her into the
Western Alliance. For the
moment I am not entering into
an argument about the merits
of this policy, but it rather


assumes that the British are not
entitled to have emotions. If
it was only yesterday that
Chinese were killing G.l.s, it
was only the day before yester-
day that Germans were killing
British Tommies as well as
American G.l.s. Taking all this
into account, I am afraid the
American argument in this
respect does not carry much
weight with British opinion.
“It would be unwise to
exaggerate the possibilities of
direct British trade with China.
There is not much that China
could send to Britain in
exchange for industrial pro-
ducts. China’s greatest need is
for extended credits, and these
Britain in any case could not
provide. But the same is not
true of Japan. Before the war
Japan did a thriving trade with
China. Both economies grew
up together. They became
interlocked and a mutual
division of labor developed in
the interests of both countries.
Cut off from the Chinese
market, Japanese exports are
driven elsewhere, frequently
into the British Common-
wealth and dependencies, to
the injury of Lancashire textiles
and other British exporting
industries.
‘“Leaving, for a moment,
the economic consequences of
this American policy, it is diffi-
cult to understand what are
the American objectives in thus
insisting on the maintenance
of Chinese isolation. Is its
purpose to starve the Chinese
revolution? If it is, then it is
practically certain to prove
ineffectual. On the contrary,
all experience shows that by
such ways revolutionary Gov-
ernments are consolidated,, and
not only consolidated but
made more oppressive in their
methods.

Communism
“The enemy of revolutionary
extremism in modern society
is industrial expansion. With
the development of the tech-
niques of modern industry,
society undergoes profound
changes. The social structure
becomes more complicated as
wider sections of the popula-
tion learn new cultural and
technical skills. Methods of
direct tyrannical oppression
which are effective in a simple
homogeneous community
prove less and less effective as
the social and economic
structure grows more complex.
— N. Y. “Herald Tribune”
MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE OFF IN ALL
DIRECTIONS.
It is a law of social evolution
that when people come to
occupy positions of authority
and initiative in industry and
commerce, and in all the arts
and sciences ancillary to them,
they come more and more to
resent limitations on personal
freedom. The crude, mono-
lithic political apparatus of
Communism is shown to be
more and more at variance
with the underlying facts of a
developing community. This
is the chief explanation of the
series of palace revolutions in
the Soviet Union.
“If all this be true, does it
not make nonsense of the
American policy of economi-
cally isolating, as far as
possible, the Communist world?
It may be a long-term answer,
but surely it is the fact, never-
theless, that the way to rid the
Communist nations of those
features which are most repug-
nant to the Western mind is to
facilitate, not to thwart, their
economic diversification. Nor
can it be said that economic
isolationism is even a short-
term answer. (I am not, of
course, arguing for the sale of
arms or of goods directly for
arms production.)
“As I have already declared,
this economic isolationism
which scarcely touches the
buoyant American economy
damages and hinders in a
thousand ways the totally
different economic needs of
Great Britain. In the past
few months, the embargo on
trade with China and Russia
has been relaxed, but the
business world of Britain is
conscious that this was accom-
plished despite prolonged and
stubborn resistance from the
United States. Gossip was
bitterly busy about the number
of American officials in Hong
Kong whose job it wao,
apparently, to keep a watch
on the extent to which Britain
was keeping faith with the
embargo.
Suez Policy
“Because of these considera-
tions, the criticism of American
foreign policy, which was con-
fined in the main to the work-
ing masses in the immediate
post-war years, spread to Con-
servative circles, until it has
now become pervasive. With
the coming of the Suez crisis,
the emphasis shifted until it is
now more marked in Con-
servative than in Labor areas of
political opinion. Indeed,
informed circles of Labor
actually grew more friendly to
the United States in the second
half of 1956, for Labor’s Suez
policy more closely resembled
that of the White House than
of our own Conservative
Government.
“Apart from its manifest
insanity, the Anglo-French
adventure in Egypt provided
evidence of the extent to which
America and Britain had
drifted apart. History shows
few similar examples of a
nation embarking on such a
wild and dangerous under-
taking whilst keeping her
closest ally in ignorance of her
intentions. That the British
Government behaved in this
way dramatically exposed the
gulf that separated Washington
from London. Ironically
enough, the line taken by
President Eisenhower drew
him closer to Labor and further
away from his political counter-
parts in Britain.
“Conservative speakers made
no attempt to hide their bitter
resentment against the United
States. Those who, like myself,
had been for years highly
critical of certain aspects of
American foreign politics were
left far behind in vituperation.
Conservative critics of the
President’s attitude felt no con-
trition at the way in which they
kept him- in the dark. When
the affair was over, and
Egyptian soil was free of the
invaders, they pointed in
cynical triumph to the Eisen-
hower Middle East Doctrine
that immediately followed as
evidence of American perfidy.
They believed the Lion had
heen driven back to its lair only
in order that the American
Eagle copld dominate the same
territory. This point of view
persists, and is reinforced by
the suspicion, amounting almost
to a certainty, that arms
supplied by America to
Saudi Arabia were recently
employed against British
interests in Oman.
Areas of Influence?
“It is openly stated in Britain
that the United States is assist-
ing in the liquidation of the
British Empire so that she can
be the residuary legatee. It is
felt that this is particularly true
of the Middle East, where
British and American oil
interests are in persistent

“CAREFUL NOW, MR. DULLES! YOU’RE PLAYING WITH FIRE.”
collision ; nor will these con-
victions be dispelled until there
is Anglo-American agreement
about the Middle East. It is not
enough that America feels she
is constrained to do w'hat she
is doing as the champion of the
free world in the struggle
against Communism. British
Conservatives are not consoled
if, whenever a blow is struck at
Communism, they are made to
bleed.
“These evidences of strained
relations between Britain and
America have given rise to
the suggestion that some
attempt should be made to
reach an agreement whereby
each is assigned its own special
area of influence, without inter-
ference from the other. It is
hard to see both where and
how this can be done. It is a
conception belonging to old-
fashioned diplomacy and is out
of place in a rapidly contract-
ing world. Furthermore, it
implies that if either gets into
. trouble when following its own
interests, it can rely on help
from the other. Is this really
practicable? Could it be
reconciled with the obligations
of both to the United Nations?
“It had been assumed until
recently that the Middle East
was a special responsibility of
Britain’s. But when she pursued
a policy there which offended
at one and the same time
against American views and
against the Charter of the
United Nations, she found
herself at loggerheads with
America. When, at one time,
it seemed that America wanted
to extend the Korean War, she
found herself at variance with
Britain. Spheres of influence
are not, in the final analysis,
consistent with the concept of
a United Nations clothed with
increasing authority. It is in
the United Nations and its
Charter that" the chief hope of
peace lies.
“Here we reach the real
problem of Anglo-American
relations. These cannot be put
on a more satisfactory footing
until agreement is arrived at
on our relations with the
Communist world. Failure to
do this bedevils our position
both in Europe and in the
Middle East.
“In both these parts of the
world it is essential to realise
that reaching an accommoda-
tion with the Communist
countries is not the same thing
as accommodating Com-
munism. The distinction is a
real one. In fact, it can be
argued that a refusal to attempt
an understanding with the
Communist nations may itself
lead to the spread of
Communism. Conditions of
economic and political dis-
turbance facilitate the spread
of Communism or its offshoots.
If the frontiers of Communism
are to be frozen where they
now are, it can be accomplished
only by pacifying and stabilis-
ing conditions in adjacent
territory. If, on the contrary,
these are constantly bubbling
with discontent, Communism
seeps across by a thousand
different channels. v
“Military containment is not
the answer, for it invites un-
settlement in the most sensi-
tively dangerous areas the
frontiers themselves. Syria is a
case in point, and so, of course,
is Eastern Germany. Russia
reacted with brutal sharpness
to the dangers of a weakening
of her military frontiers in
Hungary.
“If, in the countries con-
tiguous to the outposts of
Communism, Britain and the
United States are in conflict
with each other, a situation is
created that Soviet Russia can,
and does, exploit. Nor, to be
realistic, can she be blamed for
this if the dominating motif
of the Western Powers is the
eventual destruction of Com-
munism. On the other hand,
if the principal aim is mutual
tolerance until time and social
changes do their work, a
different and more hopeful
pattern begins.to emerge.
“It is sometimes argued that
such a course is useless because
Communism is bent on the
destruction of the institutions
of the free world, and that
therefore its dynamism must
be met by a superior dynamism
on our part. But what kind of
dynamism? Military, or social
and political? If it is the
former, then the world will go
up in flames and that will be
that. But if the dynamism is
to be socio-political, then the
circumstances must be
assembled in which it can do
its work, and this can be
accomplished only by reaching
an understanding with the
Communist nations.
“It may be said that there
is no sign of the Communist
world wanting such an under-
standing. That may be so. But
what of ourselves? Do we
want it? If the answer is yes,
then let us set about trying to
get it. Until we do, Anglo-
American relations will con-
tinue to be snarled. In the
shadow of impending catas-
trophe, in an atmosphere where
military threats and counter-
threats dominate, is it asking
too much of mankind to expect
even minor social and economic
adjustments to be hopefully
attempted?”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Two Educations
The Russian satellites and
other scientific advances since
1945 result directly from a
dual-system in world-education,
each strand ot which has no
communication with the other.
On the one hand we have
the specialised education,
spending unlimited millions on
nuclear-research, automation
and space-travel. Despite the
enormous absorption of public
funds—against which nobody
argues because we are getting
used to letting others think for
us—this is the field of the
minority. Its worst effect is the
suppression of mental activity
among the millions who can
neither share in an intelligent
“They say it's a cure for static electricity or somethin.”
understanding of it nor escape
from the responsibility to
maintain it.
On the other hand we have
the education which strives to
teach us how to live with one
another. It is this education
which bolsters the conditions
under which the scientist finds
his freedom to work, but
which is already in its death-
cycle through lack of recogni-
tion and consequent financial
starvation. The essential lack
of cultural substance in the
pure form of the new scientific
order must soon produce
insoluble difficulties in social
relationships.
In its own way Russia stands
to get a cheap bargain. The
West is about to enter the final
stages of the race to match
the Russian achievements.
There will be austerity for the
taxpayers who must support
the scramble, and it threatens
to be the austerity and priva-
tions of Communism without
any of the doubtful advantages.
It could be Communism in all
but name, self-imposed without
alternative.
If the two educations are not
integrated—even if it means
slowing-down the scientific
programme—we will face the
prospect of a Godless new
order soon disintegrating in a
world sucked dry of humanism.
—Luke (N.S.W.).
Preserving the Past
If the Commonwealth
Government’s Standing Com-
mittee on Public Works has its
way the historic and stately
Customs House in Melbourne
will be demolished and replaced
by a new building.
The committee has sound
economic grounds for its
recommendation —although in
recent years the Commonwealth
Government has shown
precious little regard for
economy. The present build-
ing is inadequate for
administrative needs; adding
an annexe to it would not
be satisfactory ; and the present
site is so valuable that
the fullest use should be made
of it. And, as the present
owner of the building, the
Commonwealth Government
has the legal right to dispose of
it as it pleases.
But more than legal rights
and administrative needs are
involved. The Customs House
stands on the very site chosen
for “a village” by Melbourne’s
founder, John Batman ; it has
been classed as one of the
finest and oldest remaining
examples of early colonial
architecture in Melbourne,
having been built in part in the
year 1841 ; and it is one of
three historic Melbourne build-
ings mentioned some months
ago (B. 20/3/’57) by Professor
Brian Lewis, of the Faculty of
Architecture at the University
of Melbourne, as being well
worth preserving for posterity
—the other two are the Royal
Mint and the Victoria
Barracks.
The Commonwealth Govern-
ment should be reminded that
the Customs House was built
by Victoria long before
Federation was dreamed of;
that, although it passed out of
control of the Victorian
Government through the trans-
fer of certain powers to the
Commonwealth, it is intrinsi-
cally still part of Victoria’s
history; and that, if the
Commonwealth no longer finds
it adequate for its purposes, it
might well be returned to the
State.
Victoria could make good use
of the building. It contains a
spacious room which could be
used for conferences, or for
the display and preservation of
State documents and records of
historic interest. In fact, it
might well be converted to
house a permanent exhibition
of the State’s activities, past
and present. — Wusslean (Vic.).
Blood-alcohol
Yes, blood-tests will tell (B.
16/10/’57). They have been
doing so for some time, and
most informed people think
that they should be compulsory.
It has been a long trail from
the earliest use of the test over
30 years ago to its present
world-wide recognition. The
credit goes, not to the medical
profession in general, but to
the physiologists who have
studied the action and the fate
of alcohol in the human body,
and to the analytical chemists
who have perfected accurate
and convenient methods of
determining the alcohol in
small amounts of blood.
Two factors have accelerated
the adoption of the test in the
more conservative countries:
the enormous increase in
motor-traffic and high-speed
cars, and recognition of the
difference between the “drunken
driver” and the person who
drives “while under the in-
fluence.” It is now acknow-
ledged that the consumption of
even a moderate amount of
alcohol renders a person unfit
to drive a car. Your capacity
is impaired long before you
start staggering and seeing
double. Any appreciable
amount of alcohol - circulating
in the blood slows down the
reaction-time, because the
groups of cells in the brain
and spinal cord responsible for
the controls and reflexes are
“intoxicated” in the medical
sense.
Much of the earlier work
began in the 1920'5, one notable
pioneer being Edward (later
Sir Edward) Mellanby, we 1
known for his work on rickets.
Using the cumbersome but
reliable analytical methods then
available, investigators had no
difficulty in determining, with
the aid of human volunteers,
the levels of blood-alcohol
attained after imbibing various
amounts and kinds of liquor.
The blood is generally con-
sidered to be the best material
for the test, although the
B.M.A. in England still clings
to urine. After all, it is the
blood that circulates the
alcohol to the brain. * There
was a great advance about 1928
when Widmark perfected a neat
and precise method of analysis
to give accurate results with
only a drop or two of blood.
The taking of a blood-sample,
from being almost a minor
operation, became a mere pin-
prick. The test has been greatly
improved in recent years and

possible to calculate the total
amount of alcohol in the body
and, therefore, to estimate the
minimum amount of liquor
which has been consumed.
From then onwards the use
of the lest snowballed. Some
American States and Scandi-
navian countries adopted legal
blood-alcohol standards defin-
ing intoxication. The common
standard is 150 milligrams, but
in Norway you are a “gone
coon” if you are caught driving
a car with 50 milligrams per
100 mils of blood.
In recent years the scene
has shifted to the courts, where
defending counsel have raised
all the arguments —the varying
reactions of different individuals
to the same amounts of liquor,
the effects on the habitual
versus the abstemious drinker,
the man who “drinks a bottle
of whisky a day and shows no
effects,” and the effects of
certain diseases and drugs. All
these have been raised and
and countered, with the aid of
laboratory and clinical research,
published results of which
would fill libraries. The result
is complete vindication of the
test.
Virtually everything is now
known about the rate of
absorption, distribution,
destruction and elimination of
alcohol in the human body.
Thousands of observations
have been made comparing the
blood-alcohol levels of people
with their behavior and reac-
tions. Moreover, as the rate of
destruction of alcohol in the
body is known, the probable
level of alcohol-concentration
in the blood at a stated time
before the blood-specimen was
taken —say, at the time of an
accident several hours before
an arrest is made can be
calculated.
Several points are worth
noting. At a concentration of
50 milligrams per 100 mils of
blood, alcohol has achieved the
object for which it is usually
taken—the loosening of inhibi-
tions, removal of strain, and a
feeling of well-being. As the
concentration goes above this,
an increasing proportion of
people are likely to be
diagnosed by a doctor as
“under the influence,” and the
ability of anybody to drive a
“Eyes right!”
car safely is impaired to some
extent.
A 50-milligram concentra-
tion is attained after drinking
30oz. of beer or three whiskies
(there is a small variation
according to body-weight and
sex). If you keep on drinking
fairly rapidly after that you
will later exceed the mark, so
if you must, don’t drive the car.
It is also worth remembering
that a meal slows up the rate
of absorption of alcohol, giving
the body time to catch up by
dealing with some of it by
oxidation. — Alchemist (Tas.).
Postage
If someone could work out
the actual cost of printing,
distributing, franking and
generally policing the postage-
stamp, it is more than likely
that we should be appalled by
the figure produced.
Wasting five minutes recently
in a queue to pay sevenpence
to send a letter airmail to
Queensland I was impressed by
the colossal army of labor
involved in the Alice-in-
Wonderland process.
Surely we would be better
off with a stampless postage,
controlled only by existing
regulations as to proper address,
packaging and weight limita-
tion a free mail - service,
covered by departmental vote
like that of defence or agri-
culture.
The only people likely to be
hurt in the process are the
philatelists ; but the system was
not originally set up for their
benefit although these days
you might think it is run for
them.—E. P. M. (N.S.W.).
Third-parly Insurance
The increasing toll of the
roads is a 20th-century
phenomenon that cannot be
dealt with intelligently within
the existing legal framework.
Nor would the abolition of
juries (B. 23/10/’57) make a
significant difference. The
judge is faced with an intoler-
able burden in allocating blame,
and it is quite unreal to think
that he will reduce damages in
cases where the plaintiff has
incurred severe injury and
suffering at the hands of a
negligent defendant., even
though the plaintiff contributed
to the accident by his own
negligence. Moreover, it is
manifestly unjust, as well as
politically unreal, to suggest
that after a statutory minimum
the damages recovered should
ciepend on the length of the
plaintiff’s purse (B. 11 /9T51).
The truth is that we have
accepted road-accidents as the
more-or-less inevitable price of
progress. Indeed the advent of
compulsory third-party insur-
ance only emphasises this
change in our social concepts.
Questions of moral fault are
more conveniently left to the
remedies of the criminal law,
although there is certainly
scope for increased premiums
from drivers involved in
accidents.
On this basis all persons
injured in a road accident
should have a right to com-
pensation fixed on a scale
similar to that in force under
the Workers’ Compensation
Acts. Undoubtedly this will
make the awards of damages


less glamorous and in some
cases cause slight injustice.
However, these disadvantages
are more than outweighed by
the fact that this scheme will
ultimately achieve a greater
justice more efficiently.— Fiat
Justitia (Vic.).
St. Mary’s
It is amazing, in the
welter of words and argument
about St. Mary’s (N.S.W.)
ammunition-plant, that no one
mentioned that the project was
obsolete before it was blue-
printed.
During World War I it
became apparent to European
defence-planners that, although
the aeroplane had its limita-
tions, the bomber would be a
mighty factor in any future
conflict. This meant that the
Clausewitz theory of total war
was, sooner or later, to become
a hideous probability, so that
the girl sewing buttons on
soldiers’ shirts a hundred
leagues behind the area of
conflict would be as much in
the fight as the infantryman
and the field-gunner in the
front line.
With this in mind, military
planners began to review their
supply organisations ; and
when the League of Nations
became quite impotent and the
spectre of war stalked the
Continent, decentralisation of
“You can stop prettying yourself up, Charlie—
she'll still prefer me.”
war-production became the
recognised principle. In Eng-
land, France and particu-
larly in Hitler’s Reich, elaborate
systems of scattered co-ordina-
tion shifted from the drawing-
board on to the terrain, and
this move was accelerated and
expanded during the so-called
“phony” war.
Czechoslovakia was ah
example of this type of
planning, because of its small
area and its unhappy geo-
graphical location.
It is fairly safe to say that
had this system of defence-
production not been wide-
spread the’ course and dura-
tion of World War II would
have been different. Between
the two great conflicts not only
had the bomber gained in
power and speed, but accuracy-
bombing had become common-
place. Only The distribution of
sites and co-ordination between
groups of subsidiary establish-
ments made possible the con-
tinuous supply of munitions to
the fighting forces. Even when
the bomber took heavy-toll of
individual munition-plants the
orderly supply went on almost
to the end.
With these facts to go on,
the establishment of a huge
munitions-plant under almost
one roof seems incredible. The
statement of Senator Spooner
to the effect that this St.
Mary’s plant was the basis
upon which the whole of the
country’s defences were built
must have made Clausewitz
and Von Bernhardi laugh from
their graves.— Fred Aarons
(N.S.W.).
Naming New States
If new States are achieved in
Australia it’s to be hoped that
their sponsors improve upon
the names borne by some of
their predecessors.
New South Wales, as a title,
is clumsy and largely meaning-
less. Western Australia is little
better, and the names South
Australia and Northern
Territory are not only
ponderous misleading,
since the one area contains
only a modest part of southern
Australia (and also extends
towards the Centre), and the
other embraces only a section

Cusack, Lynn Foster and
Catherine Shepherd, to name a
few, have been laying those
stepping-stones on the path
from the little theatres to the
professional box-office successes
of 1956-57 ; not to forget that
transitional signpost planted
about halfway along the path,
when Sumner Locke-Elliott’s
play “Rusty Bugles” was first
produced by Doris Fitton at
the Independent Theatre in
1948.
Women dramatists, although
working as hard as the oppo-
site sex in laying foundations
for the national theatre, have
not so far reaped the same
rewards.
In the 1955 P.A.B. competi-
tions, Oriel Gray’s play “The
Torrents” was awarded equal
first-place with Ray Lawler’s
play. A radio-version has been
heard on the national stations,
but the original stage-version of
this period comedy-drama of
character, with a country-news-
paper setting, has been seen
in only one capital city,
Adelaide. \
Dorothy Blewett must surely
be counted Australia’s un-
luckiest playwright, for winning
the 1947 competition 10 years
before her time! Her prize-
winning play, “The First
Joanna,” came within an inch
of production in the London
West End some three or four
years ago. The management
dropped the option on it when,
at the crucial moment, Pamela
Brown was not' available for
the leading role.
Barbara Vernon, of Inverell,
N.S.W. (and the P.A.B.’s latest
and possibly brightest “find”),
is reaping the benefit of the
trail-blazing done by her pre-
decessors. “The Multi-Colored
Umbrella,” her brash but sensi-
tive play of a Bondi racing
family (who* 5 , when they refer to
“the books,” do not mean
literature!), ran a very close
second to “The Shifting Heart”
in the 1956 Journalist Club
competition—being beaten by
half a length and a vote or
two.
“The Multi-Colored Um-
brella” had its premiere at the
Melbourne Little Theatre on
October 5. Acting partly on
the P.A.B.’s advice, the Little
Theatre invited representatives
from J. C. Williamson to take
an on Barbara
Vernon’s play ; the success of
the Melbourne season has now
ensured that the play will have
a professional Sydney season.
It is due to open at the Theatre
Royal, Sydney, on November
9, and will also be given on
A.B.C. television.
of the continent’s northern
region.
All four of these ill-chosen
names should have been skittled
long ago, and doubtless that
would have been the case but
for official conservatism and
the public’s tendency to become
hidebound by tradition. Yet,
of course, a precedent for name-
changing was established as
early as 1842, when Van
Diemen’s Land was semi-
officially discarded in favor of
a more-appropriate and more-
agreeable term, Tasmania.
Maybe it is now too late to
“rescue” N. S. Wales, S.A. and
W.A., but if and when “The
Territory” gets fairly moving,
it ought to be possible to give
that area a decent name —
though not necessarily, as was
suggested a few years ago,
Churchill or Elizabeth.
A catch in these matters is
that it isn’t easy, in most
instances, to hit upon an
appropriate name, and one that
wins general approval. North
Queenslanders learned that
when, at a recent conference at
Charters Towers, opinions
differed over a hefty batch of
names suggested for the pro-
posed New State of the North.
The list included Burdekin,
Carpentaria, Cook, Endeavor,
Kennedy, Macrossan, North
Queensland, Northland and
York; and in the final ballot
the choice, by a narrow
majority, fell upon Burdekin.
That decision strikes me as
lamentable. Certainly the
Burdekin River is an imposing
feature of the north-east, but
I doubt if any delegate who
voted for the name, as a State
title, got down to basic con-
siderations in the matter,
The fact is that the Burdekin
was discovered (on April 1,
1845) by the Leichhardt
exploratory party and was
named by the leader after “Mrs.
Burdekin of Sidney,” who had
given the expedition a trifle of
assistance, possibly a little
money but probably a supply
of chocolate,
Mrs. Burdekin (formerly
Mary Ann Bossley, who in
1833 married Thomas
Burdekin, a Sydney ironware
merchant) was doubtless a
worthy woman, but she scored
well beyond her public merits
in being presented with a large
tropical river; and the reason
that she did so, it would seem,
was that Leichhardt’s stock of
approved names, never exten-
sive, had begun to run short at
the time,
Clearly, then, it would be
absurd to apply the name
Burdekin to an entire province
—a rich and beautiful province
—of north-eastern Australia.
If any woman is to be
honored in the matter it should
not be Mary Ann of Sydney,
who knew nothing about the
area, but one of the gallant
pioneers of the region.
Personally, however, I am
dubious about the wisdom of
applying the name of any
individual, man or woman, to
a State. Surely it should be
possible, in the present instance,
to hit upon a term of general
significance and appeal.
If not, perhaps the best bet
for the North would be
Carpentaria. That name, at
least, has its roots well down
in Australian history. Ex-

PROSPECTS FOR VETS.
A S the wife of a vet. who has
spent the last three months
unsuccessfully looking for an
area either in N.S.W. or Vic-
toria in which to go into
private practice on his own, the
article in Plain English (B.
18/9/’57), “Only Two Vet.
Schools,” sets off an explosive
spark.
Speaking from experience
and not from statistics, the
country, with its still compara-
tively tiny rural population,
cannot economically absorb
very many more practitioners,
as yet.
The comparison between
vets., per million head of live-
stock, in Victoria and in
Europe and the U.S. is not a
good one. Mileage and
travelling-time is one of the
major problems of the prac-
titioner in Australia. He must
charge at least Is. 6d. a mile
travelling-expenses if he is not
to run his car and use his time
at a loss, and very often he
may spend a morning driving
40 miles to a case which may
it is claimed that the
new cobalt pellet wilt
give immunity from
phalaris staggers to
sheep grazing in the
very productive
phalaris - dominant
pastures. Here is a
development which,
like the Elastrator
Rubber Ring, should
remove anxiety from
the grazier’s mind.
By using the rubber
ring for marking and
tailing lambs instead
of the knife, graziers
are finding an effec-
tive method to reduce
losses and minimise
shock and set-back
and susceptibility to
disease.
well prove uneconomic to the
owner to treat. A grazier will
not spend, say, £2O to cure a
beast which may well only be
worth £l5.
This means that very fre-
quently the practitioner is run-
ning little more than a poorly-
paying taxi-service, which is no
great reward for five years of
intensive study, during which
time he has no earning-capacity
and after which he has to out-
lay a great deal on instruments
and reading-matter to keep him
abreast of current trends of
treatment.
Again, mention of Agri-
cultural Department vets,
raises a point of interest. The
private practitioner tends to
shy clear of districts serviced by
salaried vets. When the farmer
can get so much free advice,
why should he pay a private
practitioner? Another lot of
competitors in this field are the
big companies of manufac-
turers of agricultural and
veterinary supplies, who
employ qualified vets. * to
dispense free advice to
customers: good business, no
doubt, but a bit rough on the
private practitioner.
The life of a man in private
practice is not easy. His job is
24 hours a day, seven days a
week, always hard, even if
usually rewarding. His home-
life is virtually non-existent,
and this, in a community that
is encouraged to believe that
the home is the basis of its
stability, is difficult.
Extra responsibility is
thrown on the wife, who, of
necessity, is frequently .forced
to do jobs about the home that
are almost physically impos-
sible. And she has to answer
the telephone, the privacy of
her home is at the mercy of
her husband’s clients day and
night, and she and the children
miss the companionship to
which they are entitled. <
Once again, even if reward-
ing, the job remains difficult.
The medico in a country town
is at the public’s beck and call,
but if an accident occurs the
patient can usually be brought
into hospital, where equipment,
asepsis, staff, are possible and
available. If a woman is to
have a child, nine cases out of
ten, commonsense sees she has
it in hospital.
If an animal is hurt, it must
be attended to on the spot,
frequently with insufficient and
unskilled assistance, and with
the added danger that the
unfortunate creature is nervous
and frightened with pain. If
a cow has calving difficulty,
she’s likely to be 20 or 30 miles
from the vet., over rough roads,
on a freezing night, in the
small-hours.
Theoretically, in a country
such as ours, which owes its
economy largely to its live-
stock, there should be a limitless
number of openings for the
veterinarian who wants to use
his own initiative and ability
in order to build some sort of
a home and independence. The
tiuth is otherwise.
The greatest need would
appear to be in extension
services. Abroad, the vet. has
been an accepted and necessary
member of the community for
many years. Few people in
Australia realise that it is only
within the post-war years that
veterinarians have pioneered
new ground in going to the
country centres.
The stock-owner has to be
educated to use his local vet.
fully and effectively, just as the
vet. must learn to know some-
thing of livestock values and
agricultural economy. There
are a surprising number of
landowners who believe that
“What was good enough for
Grandpa is good enough for
me,” just as there are an
unfortunate number of vets
who dismiss an intelligent
stockman with years, and very
often generations, of stock-
knowledge behind him, as that
despised thing, “the layman.”
Surprisingly, the larger hold-
ings and studs, particularly in
the Merino world, have little
work to offer to the vet. The
opening here, if it could be
made, particularly in advisory
and husbandry services, must
make a real contribution to
national progress.
In short, there is need for
greater and happier liaison
between practitioner and land-
holder, which must come about
in time, but which could be
helped by landholders and vets,
themselves. Not least of the
ways in which the vet. can help
himself is to conform a little
to what sounds rather
priggishly like “social niceties.”
By nature of his time-consum-
ing work, the average prac-
titioner has little time for Out-
side interests, and his conversa-
tion becomes largely “shop.” I
doubt if many vets, realise how
often they rather startle and
embarrass social gatherings by
discussions that are everyday,
run-of-the-mill stuff to them,
but nevertheless, by most social
standards, coarse, and even
lepulsive.
It is a useful, honorable pro-
fession, which must play a
large part in the future of Aus-
tralia. But our vast distances

Bowas is the world’s, strongest, most versatile framework
—the perfect building material for shearers’ quarters,
cottages and homesteads. The Bowas principle (cypress
pine held rigid on both sides by mild steel members up to
thick) provides a framework (surpassed only by brick)
of immense strength. Only Bowas allows future alterations
to be made without major structural changes, and only
Bowas can be completely dismantled, then re-erected
without damage to the framework.
Bowas framework will not warp or twist; is not affected
by shrinkage, dry rot, white-ants, gum veins, etc. This is
why Bowas quality pays off in the long run, costs
practically nothing in maintenance and very little in
depreciation—holds its value years longer than any other
comparable structure. Erection of any building, from a
large homestead to small cottages, takes less time than
any other normal structure. Bowas is the modem way to
build —permanently for the years ahead!

ALMA.
Early Weaning
“Van”: The trend in Great
Britain is for a sow to have
three litters in about 13 months.
Suckers are weaned at 10 to
12 days—or earlier if desired —
and the sow returned to the
boar. Early, weaning keeps the
sow in good condition and does
not sap her reserve of strength
as suckling young ones for
eight weeks would.
Suckers weaned at 10 days
need very careful attention. It
is a job that takes extra effort
and time, and unless you are
prepared to do this it would be
better to wean at eight weeks.
When weaned, either electric
hover-lamps * should be hung
in their house, or small hot-
houses should be provided to
give the necessary warmth.
Hot-houses can be easily made
from a few bales of lucerne,
making a small low cover that
they can nestle into ; warmth is
provided from their own
bodies. These hot - houses
would be placed in the farrow-
ing-houses—the sow, of course,
being removed.
Patent gruels are sold on
the market, and these provide
everything necessary to keep
the suckers growing quickly.
The suckers actually grow
faster under this method:
however, cost of production
would be higher than if the
sow fed them herself. The
gruel should be given a little at
a time and often. Cleanliness
is essential, even to seeing that
no food is left in the feed-
bowls between feedings. Gruel
turns rancid, upsetting the
suckers and defeating the object
of early weaning.
Cleanliness, warmth and
frequent feedings are the
successful factors in early wean-
ing. Despite the extra cost to
raise a sucker under this system,
it grows faster, and, most
important, it is possible for the
sow to have three litters in 13
months. This is of vital
economic importance to the
pig-raiser.
However, a word of warning
—don’t rush in without careful
thought ... it is a system that
would only be suited to a few
layouts. Certainly any man
who runs pigs as a sideline
would be foolish to adopt the
system, as it absorbs so much
time. But it is a challenge to the
pig-raiser who has a suitable
layout: dry, warm housing with
suitable drainage.
Re-seeding
Mitchell-grass
“Splodger”: The best and
easiest way to re-seed a paddock
with Mitchell-grass is to get
a flock of full-woolled sheep.
Select another paddock which
is heavy with seed just ripening.
Put those woolly sheep into the
paddock—and stock it heavily.
The seed of the Mitchell will
“Know anything about horses?”
catch in the fleeces of the sheep
as they work through the grass.
When the time and the seed are
both ripe, shift those sheep into
the paddock which is eaten out
of Mitchell and which
requires re-seeding.
A lot of the seed will fall
off as the sheep work the worn-
out paddock ; a lot more will
be brushed-off as the sheep rub
against each other; the bit
that’s left didn’t cost anything
to gather, so it’s no loss.
The fact of the seed falling
from the fleeces ensures it will
bevirtually harrowed-in by the
trampling trotters of the mob
as they feed from place to place.
That embeds it, and offers some
protection from galahs,
corellas and budgerigars. A
man is practically assured of a
rattling good strike after the
next wet season. '
But don’t make the same
mistake which I did when
managing a big station in the
far west of Queensland. Don't
put sheep in on the new
growth until it is well estab-
lished. I'd say about three
months at least is needed to
allow a stool to grow a root-
system. Even dainty eaters
such as sheep will pull the
young stuff up by the roots if
it is younger than that. Then,
though all else has been a
noble conception, well executed,
the whole will be up to putty.
Corn-ear Worm
“Myall”: The corn - ear
worm has plenty of Queens-
land farmers worried. It
attacks a variety of crops,
including maize, linseed,
lucerne, cotton, sorghum,
tobacco, peanut, tomato, bean,
lettuce, cabbage and cauli-
flower. The moth has a wing-
span of lyin., fore-wings are a
reddish pink, back-wings a
creamy yellow, with large
smoky areas along the edges.
It lays eggs on the flowers,
flower-buds, or the young
foliage of plants. Eggs are
white, and about half the size
of a pin’s he&d. They are
usually laid singly, and after an
incubation period of from
three to six days the young
worms emerge, and commence
to feed on the host-plant. The
grubs vary greatly in color
when fully grown, some being
pale-green, while others are
dark-brown with stripes of
different shades.
The insects grow rapidly, up

to liin. in about 18 days.
During this period they do an
enormous amount of damage,
especially to linseed, maize and
cotton.
Control methods vary con-
siderably, according to the
variety of plant attacked.
Tobacco, peanuts and the
various vegetables should be
sprayed with D.D.T. at a
strength of 0.1 per cent., or
dusted with a 2 per cent, dust,
every fortnight. Linseed and
grain-sorghum are sprayed with
25 per cent. D.D.T. at the rate
of lgal. of the insecticide tp
2} acres. This gives coverage
for three weeks or even longer,
provided no rain falls to wash
it off. A kill, without coverage,
will be obtained at half the
above strength.
In maize and cotton, control
is more difficult, as the young
worm enters the cob or boll
soon after hatching, and is thus
protected from spraying.
Keeping the field and around
the headlands free from weeds
will greatly help, as the pest
lives on many of these, particu-
larly the pigweeds, twin-leaf
and wild cape-gooseberry,
while bull-head and allied
weeds are also attacked.
Dusting with D.D.T. 10 per
cent, powder at the rate of
81b. to 101 b. per acre, or spray-
ing with a mixture of three pints
D.D.T. 25 per cent., 3gals. of
molasses and 12gals. of water
per acre during the egg-laying
period will keep the young
worms in check.
Lucerne, when attacked,
should be cut for hay as soon
as possible. The drying of
the stems will destroy most of
the pests, and the subsequent
crop will be very likely free
from attack.
Tractors for
Yugoslavia
A cable from Massey-Harris
Ferguson, Ltd. (U.K.), advises
that Yugoslavia has ordered
1000 Fqrguson tractors, plus
accessories, and 6500 imple-
ments. Since 1955 the Massey-
Harris Ferguson company has
had three large orders from
Yugoslavia. The first was worth
£4,250,000, the second, in May
this year, was worth £2,500,000,
and the latest —delivery to be
completed by the end of this
year—-will be worth £1,100,000.
A total of £7,850,000.
Clamps
“Milfay”: Experiments with
comparatively lightweight
clamps in north-east Victoria
indicate that this method of
making above-ground silage
has several advantages over
wedge- and bun-stacks.
In addition to having less
waste-liable surface than the
wedge or bun, the clamp is less
dangerous to make than the
former, and presents two
straight faces to self-fed stock.
This prevents fouling and
breaking of the top seal, as
often happens when stock are
given access to a bun.
Small 15-ton clamps of silage
seem well worth while, even
when fed back to stock as soon
as the summer or autumn after
they have been made.
A 16-weeks trial at Ruther-
glen Research Station, using
twins, showed that it made
little difference to milk-yields
and butterfat-tests whether
the cattle were self-fed with
silage, or given hay in addition
to some paddock feed and con-
centrates.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(24/10/’57)
There may be some fairly good falls on parts of the
Queensland south coast and Darling Downs during
November, but otherwise the State will get only light to
moderate, patchy rains, with general relief rains in
December.
Much the same picture is indicated for N.S.W. in
November, with some moderate rain, below average, on the
coast and tablelands, and relief rains in most of the State
in December.
In Victoria, rainfall should vary from moderate to
reasonably good in November, with parts of the Mallee and
northern division getting only light rain. December should
be a month of patchy rainfall, with the best falls in the
southern half of the State.
Reasonably good rains likely in the central agricultural
area of S.A, during November, but patchy elsewhere.
December mainly dry.
Good rain may fall in the East Kimberleys of W.A,
in November, with moderate to good rain in the south-west
corner, and poor rainfall in the balance of the State.

Here is Barbara Vernon, whose play
“The Multi-colored Umbrella” opens at
the Royal next Saturday (November 9).
In the last eight of the ten years that she
has been an announcer with station 2NZ
at Inverell (her home-town) she has pro-
duced three plays a year for the drama-
group she formed there. She writes the
scripts for, as well as conducts, the
women’s and children’s sessions, and also
runs the station's drama-club ; and her
spare time is devoted to the teaching of
drama and theatre. Besides writing “The
Multi-colored Umbrella” (which won
second-prize in the Playwrights' Advisory
Board’s competition ) she has turned out
two other plays in the last two years:
“The Passionate Pianist” (which involves
the same family as inhabits “Umbrella”),
and “The Naked Possum,” which has as
its theme guerrilla warfare in Malaya.
The daughter of a country doctor, Miss
Vernon was educated at the New Eng-
land Girls' School, Armidale, following
which she was in turn librarian and
teacher of voice-production and dramatic
art before taking to radio. During the
war she served with the W.A.A.A.F.

member of the Victorian Women Gradu-
ates’ Association and a holder of various
offices in organisations of the Presbyterian
Church, Mrs. Wardlaw takes an active
interest in the Hermitage Old Girls’ Asso-
ciation and the Play-reading Group.
For some years she has been a vice-
president of Melbourne Y.W.C.A. and a
member of the National Social Responsi-

MELBOURNE
Four hundred guests attended Queen’s
Hall, Parliament House, for the reception
, given by the State Goverfiment to
welcome-home Governor Sir Dallas
Brooks and Lady Brooks. The vice-regal
pair were received by Premier Henry
Bolte and Mrs. Bolte, and Legislative
Assembly Speaker W. J. F. McDonald
and Mrs. McDonald. The slim-fitting
frock of navy crepe worn by her
Excellency was topped with a small white
flower-laden toque. Lady Brooks's step-
niece, Wendy Raphael, chose a navy-and-
white spotted-silk frock. Mrs. Bolte had
a matching sequin-covered beret for her
navy silk frock. Mrs. McDonald’s grey-
and-white spotted-silk suit was worn with
a tiny jewel-embroidered cap.
Among the guests were the Lord Mayor
and Lady Mayoress (Cr. F. W. and Mrs.
Thomas), she wearing a slim, black silk
frock and small hat of lily-of-the-valley
blooms; Sir Arthur Warner and Lady

Hundreds of people lined Bourke
Street to watch the arrival of guests for
the premiere of Mike Todd's “Around the
World in 80 Days” at the Esquire
Theatre. Proceeds were for the Lord
Mayors Appeal and the Anti-Cancer
Council Appeal. The Governor and Lady
Brooks were received by the managing-
director of United Artists, Mr. R. G.
Michaels, and Mrs.. Michaels, and the
managing-director of Hoyt’s Theatres,
Mr. Ernest Turnbull, and Mrs. Turnbull.
Lady Brooks’s short evening-coat of
pastel-blue faille, which was embroidered
with gold thread, was worn over a
matching frock.
The after-show party, held at Menzies’,
was a fabulous affair; with exotic foods
of wondrous variety. Among those who
attended it were- Mrs. John Buckland,
whose theatre-coat was of Ming-blue
satin ; Mrs. R. G. Michaels, her slim,
short sheath-frock of black and silver
lame; Mrs. Ernest Turnbull, her pat-
terned chiffons in pastel-blue and white ;

At the Derby Eve dinner-dance at the
South Pacific, St. Kilda (helping the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children), 150 guests were received by the
president of the committee, Mrs. lan
Miller, who wore a gown of hibiscus-pink
nylon-velvet. Among the dancers were
Mrs. Hamilton Sleigh (her white chiffons
cut on Grecian lines); Labor Minister
Harold Holt and Mrs. Holt, whose party
included the Marcel Dekyveres from
Sydney ; Mr. and Mrs. John Grimwade
and Mrs. Geoffrey Grimwade ; Mrs. Ken
Guest, whose black taffeta frock featured
a harem-hemline ; Mrs. F. Hobbil Cole,
who allied an orchid-pink, jewelled
bodice with a pleated black crepe skirt;
and Joyce Bowman, whose frock of
powder-blue satin had the bodice
embroidered with crystal beads.
Mrs. L. F. Donnelly, wife of the
Assistant U.S. Air Force Attache, has
been in Australia for three years. In the
absence of Mrs. Max Clements (who is
overseas ) Mrs. Donnelly has been acting-
president of the American Women’s
Auxiliary to the Royal Children’s
Hospital. She is also a member of the
Australian-American Association and of
the R.A.A.F. Women’s Association.
Another curtain-raiser to the Derby
was the afternoon-tea which the Lady

comes back at the end of two
years and they both think as
they do, he shall make no
objection.
Their friends wished them to
be married at once, but he is
a very queer-tempered old
gentleman and will not hear of
it. He would not allow poor
Bella to go to the picnic, but
Mrs. Waddington managed that
they should be as much together
and as long as possible.
Mrs. W. and I became great
friends, and I feel that my
friendship with the family at
The Mount has been very much
cemented by these last few
days. From the picnic I drove
back with Tregenna, Arnold
and Ritchie. We then went to
supper at The Mount, and
there lingered on, loth to
break up, as so many of us were
not to meet again—many pro-
bably never in this world.
Arnold and I exchanged
addresses, and he begged of me
to write to him. About 11 I
bid good-bye to him, Tregenna
Biddulph, Rachel Biddulph
(who was to go to Southampton
with her brother), and Malden.
I shall ever look back to this
as one of the happiest days of
my life. I could hardly imagine
a party so large without one
objectionable member in it. I
wish I could look forward to
my own wedding being as
delightful as this has been, but
that I cannot—there will not be
the same elements.
August 2. —Went to The
Mount for breakfast. Oh, how
our party has shrunk! Mr.
and Mrs. Pinchard, Biddulph
[Pinchard] and Theophilus,
Mr. Reeve, Rachel Bid-
dulph, Mary Fraser, Mr.
Ritchie and myself—t his
was all. Horace Waddington
came in. Mr. and Mrs. P.
most kindly wished me to re-
main with them, but that could
not be, though I should have
liked it.
They have been most
kind, and have taken the

greatest interest in me and my
Maggie. They much wished,
and so did Lester and Rose,
that she could have been with
them and me. After breakfast,
bidding unwilling good-bye, I
called to see Mrs. Waddington
and Annie, a very sweet child.
Mrs. W. insists upon my com-
ing to see her at Clevedon in the
winter. I will if possible. At
11.30 Ritchie and 1 started to-
gether, he for Tiverton Road,
I for Exeter.....

Edward's School, near Birming-
ham.

I went to Taunton by the
express. Put up (as far as
sleeping) at the Castle. Lived
with the Lesters at their lodg-
ings. Met Lester at the station,
who was waiting for the down
express to receive Miss Blake
and his cousin, Lizzie Lester.
After lunch we went to The
Mount—did not see Kate, she
has been very poorly for some
days, but is getting better. I
took Mary’s paper flowers,
which were much admired. We
then played quoits, where I
think I caught a bad cold.
Dined at the Lesters, and spent
the evening at The Mount.
January 3.— Woke with a
cold, which I hoped would wear
off. Got a letter from
Maggie before going out.
Breakfasted at the Lesters
and after wrote to Maggie.
Then we went to The Mount
and played quoits. On going
back to The Mount, found
Mrs. Throwesby busily en-
gaged working up Mary’s
flowers into a wreath with ivy,
holly, etc., and very well indeed
it looked.
My old friend of the last
wedding, Miss Fraser, had
arrived, but this time I am
not to be a groomsman, but
am to take charge of Rose
Lester. After lunch we—Lester,
Alfred and I—-walked to the
station to receive a box of
camellias from Pirrie’s, which
we got. We also met Ritchie.
Dined at Lester's, and immedi-
ately went to The Mount. My
cold had got so much worse
that I would have very much
sooner have gone to bed, but,
being specially engaged to
manoeuvre cakes out of their
boxes, I had to wait until the
tables were ready, and that was
not till past 10.
There was some capital sing-
ing, especially Mr. P.’s
“Warrior.” Mrs. and Miss
Sheil and Miss Trenchard were
there, also Mr. Ritchie and Mr.
Woodall, the last a stranger to
me, and a young Sheil. Got
away at half-past-10, quite
knocked-up.
January 4. —Having had
some preliminary breakfast at
Lester’s at half-past-nine went
to The Mount, and at quarter-
to-ten started for church as
follows:
Ist carriage: Mrs. Pinchard and
Mr. Arnold.
2nd carriage: Mrs. Sheil, Mr.
Sheil.
3rd carriage: Mrs. Lester, myself
and Alfred.
4th carriage: Miss Bella Badcock,
Mr. Arthur Arnold. Miss Laura

Theophilus Pinchard. Miss G.
Badcock, Mr. William Pinchard.
6th carriage: Miss Blake, Mr.
Sheil. Miss Fraser, Mr. Pullen.
7th carriage: Miss Trenchard, Mr.
Woodall. Miss Lizzie Lester, Mr.
Ritchie.
Bth carriage: Miss Biddulph, Mr.
Pinchard.
9th carriage: Miss Rachel Bid-
dulph, Mr. Lester.
The church was very full in-
deed, wherever there was a
sight to be got. It was famously
warm, thanks to Mrs. Pinch-
ard’s care. We had the whole
service this time by particular
desire.
Returning from church I
took Mrs. Sheil, Sr., and John
Lester himself took Rose. The
day was beautiful, the sun
shining right in the faces of the
brides as they left the church.
Mr. Parr came to breakfast
and also Mr. and Mrs. Trench-
ard and Mr. and Mrs. Badcock.
We waited very little time
after the return from church.
I was at the upper table with
Mrs. Lester and close to Mr.
Parr. I was introduced to him
and found him a pleasant little
man. Arnold spoke very well
indeed in return for his and his
wife’s health, with much feel-
ing. I had to propose the health
of the bridesmaids. We did not
waste much time, being an hour
later than in August.
Mr. and Mrs. Sheil left first.
They went to Durston and
joined the up express, going
to London. Mr. and Mrs.
Arnold left a quarter-hour
after, also for Durston, to join
the down express for Torquay.
I was still so seedy that I
feared increasing my cold and
perhaps bringing on fever if I
stayed,.so I got permission to
be off at once, and Alfred and
I managed to get away in time
for the down express. Care-
fully avoided seeing the new
couple. Oddly enough found
another couple waiting at the
station from Wellington en
route to Plymouth.
March 28, 1855.— 1 left by
the 2.40 and went to Taunton.
Left beautiful weather in
Exeter, found that they had had
snow and lots of rain all the
morning at Taunton. Mrs.
Pinchard and I had a long
walk. Mr. Sidney Gurney at
The Mount in the evening and
we had a very pleasant chat —
Mr. and Mrs. Pinchard, Mr.
G., and myself.
March 29. —At about half-
past-11 Mr. Barne came. He
has been in Devonshire for
some little time, having had
scarlet-fever, and so gone away
for change of air. He seems far
from strong now. Mrs. P., Mr.
B. and I had a long walk in
the afternoon. Weather fine but
very cold. Mr. B. and I spent
the evening alone, the others
being out at an evening party.
March 30. —Left Taunton
about half-past-three.

“H.D.” (New Farm, Q.):
Donald Dinnie was a
champion Highland athlete
who came out to Australia
from Scotland about the late
’eighties of last century and
issued a challenge to all and
sundry to meet him at field-
games and wrestling. I saw
him in Brisbane Show-ring at
that time, tossing the caber,
putting the shot, etc. —and, my
word, he was a. fine big fellow
and certainly was a champion.
An old English wrestler who
kept a store in Stanley Street,
South Brisbane, named Stables,
challenged Donald to a
wrestling match, but he was
not quite good enough.
“C.E.” (Ashburton, Vic.):
As Donald Dinnie came from
the same town in Scotland —
Stonehaven (Stonehive to the
locals) —as my parents, I am
able to supply you with a few
details which may be of
interest. Donald Dinnie is
considered to have been the
strongest athlete ever to come
out of Scotland, and probably
equal to the very best of the
strong men who have visited
Australia. I saw him in the early
’nineties; tossing the caber and
wrestling Professor Miller on
the Melbourne Cricket
Ground. On a recent visit to
the Highland Games at
Braemar I watched several
brawny Scots trying to toss
Dinnie’s caber. Not one
succeeded. When the railway
was being built at Stonehaven
a lot of Irish navvies used to
slip the heads off their picks
and come into the town look-
ing for trouble. They found
it! The three Dinnie brothers
used to give them a great
reception. There were epic
fights and many cracked heads
in the toon in those days.
Donald liked his wee drap of
Scotch and at times could
become a menace in Stone-
haven when foo. My grand-
father, Sergeant John Gartly,
more than once had to lock
him up to sober him down.
Although Dinnie could have
crushed the sergeant with one
hand, he had great respect for
the uniform and always went
quietly.
“J.S.” (Toronto, N.S.W.):
This takes me back to my
early twenties. Donald Dinnie
was a Scottish counterpart of
Eugene Sandow, the strong
man of that time. He appeared
in his exhibits of strength in
vaudeville at Newcastle. This
is authentic, as I was privi-
leged to see him in his acts.
From what I can remember of
discussion of his prowess at the
time his proper name was
Denny.
“W.J.S.” (Tewantin, Q.):
Donald Dinnie was a very
strong weightlifting Scotch-
man who toured Australia
about 1895. As there were no
motor-cars to lift at that time,
he used to lift horses. He was
strong both physically and in
character. He had a sister in
Queensland.
“A.M.” (Adelaide): Donald
Dinnie was a Scot, an out-
sized and very powerful man,
excelling in all the local athletic
pastimes. He was, in addition,
so active that he could run the
100yds. in lOsec., or however
the equivalent distance was
timed. I have forgotten the
exact details, but could prob-
ably find out a bit more if
no one weighs in with them in
the meantime. I am under the
impression that he lived during
the latter half of last century.
“D. E. Mac.” (East Kew,
Vic.): Donald Dinnie was a
professional strong-man about
1890, doing the usual stunts—
weightlifting, tossing the
caber, etc. I think he was a
Scot. He was naturally strong
• —not cultivated strength, as
Sandow claimed to have had.
“H.C.G.” (Camp Hill, Q.):
Approximately 60 years ago,
when I was a boy in my early
'teens in Armidale (N.S.W.),
I heard the name of Donald
Dinnie mentioned at various
times. I cannot clearly
remember the circumstances,
but I think that he was an
athlete, and a rather promi-
nent one in those days. I
fancy he was a runner, a
jumper or a wrestler.
“P.O’H.W.” (Toorak, Vic.):
So far as I can remember,
Donald Dinnie was a Scotch
wrestler and general strong-
man athlete who had some
epic struggles with “Professor”
Miller.
“Byand” (Beerwah, Q.):
In 1903 I finished my appren-
ticeship in Alexandria (Vale of
Loven, Dumbartonshire, Scot-
land), and had met Donald
Dinnie on several occasions.
At that time he was making
clogs for the print-and-dyer
workers in the yarious mills,
and had a shop in the main
street. The powers related to
him were in conjunction with
Highland Gathering contests.
The stories of his strength
were many, but particularly
in relatiop to some special
tree from which the clog-soles
were made. He undertook to
throw it as a caber in return
for the tree. It was thought
impossible, but he won, and
got his tree. A special kind of
guillotine was used to get the
clog-soles, and orders came
from Lancashire, England. To
be of any standing in the Vale
of Loven, you had to wear a
pair of Donald Dinnie clogs.
Mothers were most insistent.
A cheerful smiling gentleman,
“PROFESSOR”' MILLER
it was always a pleasure to
meet him.
“K.C.8.” (Collarene-
bri, N.S.W.): The Donald
Dinnie mentioned by Lawson
was a noted Scotch athlete
and professional strong man
who toured Australia during
the heyday of the goldfields.
“Oak A.” (Ingleburn,
N.S.W.): I had a mate before
World War I who was a
“Glasgow Keelie” and never
tired of singing the praises of
one Donald Dinnie, a lieut. in
the Glasgow Constabulary—
7ft. tall, of immense strength,
an expert at tossing the caber
gnd hammer-throwing, could
bend a fin. iron bar with a
blow across his biceps, and
hold a man out at arm’s
length by the scruff of the
neck. He must have been
some man to earn such praise
from a “Keelie” (the toughest
gang in Glasgow). He was
reputed to have had the habit
of lifting the flower-pots from
the first-floor window-ledges as
he passed, to the annoyance of
the womenfolk, Ido not think
he fell from grace when he
challenged Shimo, the 4ft. 6in.
Japanese jiu-jitsu expert of
those days, and lost.
“R.W.” (Noosaville, Q.):
Donald Dinnie was the out-
standing heavyweight athlete
at Highland Games about the
turn of this century. I have only
hearsay youthful memories of
his prowess, but I seem to
recollect that Dinnie was an
all-round athlete who was as
outstanding in track-events as
he was in the “heavy” field. I
think he was born in my native
Aberdeenshire, and lived for
many years in either Maud or
New Deer area.
“Berri” (Berrima, N.S.W.):
Donald Dinnie was a big High-
lander. He toured southern
Australia about 75 years ago.
He used to compete at High-
land Gatherings. No one could
get anywhere near him at toss-
ing the caber and throwing the
hammer.
“Kehu” (Fairfield, N.S.W.):
Donald Dinnie was a Scotch
weightlifter and wrestler. When
Henry Lawson taught the
Maori school at Mangamaunu,
near Kaikaura, Donald Dinnie
visited there with his little
touring show (comedian and
other items). Probably Henry
Lawson saw him then.
“W.G.W.” (Cairns, N.Q.):
A benefit-night for Donald
Dinnie was held in 1906 at the
London Scottish H.Q. (59
Buckingham Gate, S.W.).
Although then up in years, he
was still a fine figure of a man
—chest and back covered with
medals which he had won in
wrestling, running and jumping.
He had been up in the
money one time, but dropped
it all here in the 1893 bank-
smash. A fine all-round
athlete.
“ Tronner ” (Indooroopilly,
Q.): Donald Dinnie was a
famous Scottish athlete
towards the end of the 19th
century. He was very versatile
—he seemed to specialise in
hammer-throwing, caber-toss-
ing and wrestling ; but he was

quite accomplished in other
branches of athletics. He visited
Australia about the ’nineties,
I think. I saw him at the
Glasgow police-sports in the
early years of this century, and
although old then, he was, in
his kilt, a very fine figure of
a man.
“R.C.K.” (Moonee Ponds,
W.A.): My father (Wm. T.
Kerr, Jedburgh, Scotland)
arrived in Australia about
1880. I was born 1892. I have
always been interested in
athletics, both at school and in
open company, and during my
father's life he often quoted the
name of Donald Dinnie as an
outstanding Scottish all-round
sportsman, with prowess as a
wrestler, strong-man, and as
a competitor in tossing the
caber. In the south of Scotland
I believe he was a competitor
in the Border Games, which
are still held annually.
“F.J.C.8.” (Esperance,
W.A.): Donald Dinnie was a
Highland strong-man athlete,
shot-put and caber-throwing
champion. He was a particu-
larly strong and muscled
Scotchman, and if my memory
serves me correctly, he was also
Commissioner of Police at
Wellington (N.Z.) about 50
years ago.
“G.J.C.” (Hawthorn, Vic.):
Some 60 years ago I was
serving my apprenticeship as a
proofreader with A. H.
Massina and Co., then pub-
lishers of the widely-read
“Sportsman” weekly news-
paper. I can well remember
reading quite a lot about
Donald Dinnie, I think a
strong-man, wrestler and athlete
from Scotland. He had many
encounters with the then Aus-
tralian champion “Professor”
Miller, who, I believe, won
most of the events, staged both
in Sydney and Melbourne. I
can’t recall seeing Donald
Dinnie, but Prof. Miller often
called at the “Sportsman” office.
“M. 8.” (Launceston, Tas.):
Donald Dinnie was a famous
Scottish athlete, born on July
8, 1837, at Aboyne, Aberdeen-
shire. He exhibited great
physical strength—he was 6ft.
tall and had a 48in. chest; his
training-weight was 15st. All
his life he stuck to the kilt. It
;was, however, in tossing the
caber that Donald shone
chiefly: he won it eight times.
He indulged in all the other
usual Scottish sports—hammer-
throwing, putting and wrestling.
He won over 10,000 prizes.
“N. J. McK.” (Pemberton,
W.A.): About 1902 I saw
Donald Dinnie wrestle in Perth
in Her Majesty’s Theatre. I
was only a lad at the time, but
it being the first wrestling-
match I saw I can still remem-
ber it. Could be the Donald
Dinnie you are inquiring
about.
“Alex” (Napier, N.Z.) :
Donald Dinnie was a wrestler
in Edwardian (VII) days—l do
not know if national or inter-
national fame, but he was well
known in the north of Scotland
in the period mentioned.
“Angus Bob” (Summer Hill,
N.S.W.): Donald Dinnie was a
famous Scottish athlete of his
day. He competed at Highland
Games in various events the
high leap, foot-races, and even
dancing. His greatest achieve-
ments were in throwing the
hammer and putting the shot;
his record for the 161 b. ball
stood for many years. Dinnie
was born in 1837 and died in
1916. He toured Australia, New
Zealand and the United States.
A book on Highland Games is
in preparation by David
Webster; it will give some
account of Dinnie’s athletic
records. These few notes were
passed on to me by a friend
in Scotland, who acknowledges
the kindness of the editor of
“The Aberdeen Press and
Journal” in supplying her with
them.
Of the phone-calls received,
there was one from an ex-
Enzedder, adamant that
in the Scotch-settled neck of
the woods where he spent his
youth Donald Dinnie was a
“household word.”
Then there was a call from
author and Bulletin con-
tributor Alec Chisholm, who
remembered having made a
reference to Dinnie in one of
his books, Scots Wha Hae
(published in 1950; a history
of the Royal Caledonian Society
of Melbourne). He also men-
tioned that in the new Aus-
tralian Encyclopaedia (he’s
editor-in-chief) there will be a
reference to Donald Dinnie.
Here is the Scots Wha Hae
reference (introduced in a dis-
cussion on patronage):
Patronage, of course, was not all
one-way traffic. While seeking the
approval of the King’s representa-
tives, the Society in its turn was
often asked to bestow patronage.
Such a request reached the
Council in 1886 from “the Herd
Laddie” (Andrew Wylie), a Scot
who had risen from cow-tending
to such remarkable eminence as a
draughts-player that it was said
he could defeat skilled oponents
wdth his eyes blindfolded. Another
request of the kind, made in ’9l,
was from Donald Dinnie, a sturdy
Scot (son of an Aberdeen poet and
brother of a dectective-inspector at
Scotland Yard), who was probably
the best all-round athlete In the
world of his time.
The Council “played canny” in
both cases: it agreed to give
patronage to “the Herd Laddie,”
but without accepting any financial
responsibilities, and it asked
Donald Dinnie for more informa-
tion ....
Since his name occurs so
frequently in connection with
Dinnie, it is appropriate to
have “Professor” Miller’s word
on Donal’ —from a little paper-
back (to be found neatly
Morocco-bound in the Mitchell
Library) entitled Health, Exer-
cise and Amusement, by Prof.
W. Miller, Retired Champion
Athlete of the World:
DONALD DINNIE
This magnificent specimen of
health and thoroughly developed
manhood was born at Aboyne,
Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on the
10th July, 1837. He stands 6ft. lin.
in his shoes, weighed in best
form 15st. 71b., and measured
round the chest 47in.; biceps,
16Jin.; thigh, 2G£m-; calf, 17iin.
During his career he is credited
with having won over 7500
money prizes, and over 100
champion medals, cups, etc. His
early records include: 1871—Threw
the 161 b. hammer, fair stand,
138 ft. Bin.; 221 b. hammer, fair
stand, 104 ft. 6in. 1868 —Tut the
161 b. stone 49t't. 6in.; 181 b. stone,
44ft. Bin.; 221 b. stone, 39ft. 9in.
At Aberdeen, in 1868, he threw a
561 b. weight by ring, fair stand,
28ft. lin. He has several times
cleared sft. llin. at running high
leap; 20ft. lin. at running long
leap; and 44ft. at hop, step and
jump. He has run 100yds. in
10-2/5 seconds. He has lifted from
the ground to stretch at arms
above head .two dumb-bells, one
weighing 1281 b., the other 1121 b.,
and a two-handed dumb-bell
weighing 2501 b. On the 22nd
March, 1884, Dinnie arrived in /Mel-
bourne, after a successful tour of
America. He at once issued a
challenge through “The Sports-
man,’’ offering to any athlete the
concession of 10t't. in throwing the
hammer; 2ft. in putting the stone;
Ift. in tossing the 561 b. weight;
and in tossing the caber, Ift. cut
off the caber. He made a match
at heavy dumb-bell lifting with
Professor Miller. Each won five
feats, and Dinnie lost the toss for
the deciding feat and the match.
He subsequently wrestled a draw
with Miller in Grfeeo-Knman and
Scotch styles—three falls each;
lost a match to the Professor in
the Bijou Theatre; and won one
from him in the Victoria Hall.
Was defeated by Clarence Whistler
in the same hall, but made a draw
with Tom Cannon in the Alexandra
Theatre. Defeated Mons. Victor
in the Victoria Hall. At the Cale-
donian games all round the country
Donald Dinnie was a conspicuous
figure, his presence recalling to
the minds of many of his country-
men the years when, in Scotland,
Dinnie’s arrival on the sports-
ground was hailed with accla-
mation. He is now in New Zealand
travelling with a variety company.
After all that, one looking
through the old Bulletin files
for something else came across
the following terse reference to
oor Donal’ in the issue of July
21, 1888:
Our auld acquaintance Donald
Dinnie has been refused a licence
for a suburban hotel, on profes-
sional grounds. Mr. Judge Moles-
worth, who is himself no milksop
of a man, put the matter thus:
“There was evidence that Sunday
after Sunday Dinnie’s hotel (one
formerly tenanted by Donald) had
been visited by numbers of young
men, who were attracted by the
fact that the licensee had won a
reputation as a wrestler. The fact
that a man had this reputation
was in itself strong reason for
considering him an improper
person to hold a licence.”
Finally, as this is a record of
reader - inquiry and reader -
response, it may be appropriate
to conclude with two contribu-
tions that were, in the light of
the other replies, a little sur-
prising :
“C.P.D.” (Lindfield, N.S.W.):
“Stronger than Donald Dinnie.”
It is probable that Henry
Lawson, in making this com-
parison, had in mind a Clydes-
dale horse of that name who
was champion of his breed in
Scotland—the home of the
Clydesdale about half a
century ago, when that power-
ful and active animal was the
main source of strength for
the farmer and the carrier,
before being superseded by the
tractor and the semi-trailer.
“Oera” (Albert Park, Vic.):
Who was Donald Dinnie? In
Dick Pascoe’s gallery of wool-
producing notabilities at Burra
(S.A.) there is a large portrait
of Donald Dinnie. He was a
Merino ram.


return to the Labor fold, restore the
party and lead it to victory.
Ryan, the Leftists of the 1921 con-
ferences, and the £25,000 subscribed as
his douceur —not by such generalised
subscription as Whyte suggests —stood
in the way of this artless plan. Also,
the fact that new gods had grown up
in the Labor party.
Yet the yearning never died. The
Hughes who made secret overtures to
Labor in 1918 and 1920 was the same
Hughes who wrecked the Bruce-Page
Government, voted in the Menzies era
against the sale of the Commonwealth
ships and elected to remain in the War
Council with Labor when his Tory
colleagues retired during World War 11.
Essentially, Hughes was by nature
inescapably a Labor man. Agitation,
attack was his metier rather than the
constructive statesmanship for which
Whyte allows him, trustingly, all too
much kudos. He had little constructive
ability, and lacked the deep knowledge
of practical industry for which Whyte
gives him credit. But he had a sponge-
like capacity for absorbing other
people’s knowledge and at short-notice
retailing it with the virtuosity of an
accomplished expert.
His picturesqueness was his greatest
asset, along with a vitality which
would be hard to match. W. A.
Watt, who was his deputy at the end
of World War I, spoke some of the
truth when he said meditatively that
Billy stole and used the effects of
Gallipoli on the public emotions of
1915-16 for his own ends, and had
been able to do it because he was even
noisier than Gallipoli.
It is a tribute to and proof of the
strength of his personality that he was
able to survive after the failures of the
two conscription fights and some other
debacles and in the face of his inability
to compromise and of the flock of
purposeful enmities bred of his fully
exercised flair for vituperation and his
tendency to consider those around him
merely as the instruments of his policy
to be used for his own ends and then
thrown away.
As one who had a great deal of
intimate and confidential dealing with
him during World War I and saw him
often in his last years, I would seriously
disagree with Whyte’s summing-up of
him in his final days: “He was the
friend of all.”
You could develop a kindly affec-
tion for Billy, even at his worst; but it
was the same sort of amused affection
you might have felt for a pet cheetah.
You loved him as a diversion, but
expected nothing in return, and
devoutly hoped that the meat supply
would not run short while you were
about and he was hungry for gore. I
doubt if he ever had a real intimate
on the basis of unselfish friendship,
though he had a good many cronies.
Archie Cameron used to his face
almost the same words that Whyte
uses in his book, two or three years
before the “great heart” was stilled,
when, bent on a little quiet historical
mischief, he and I decided to get the
old man to lunch with Earle Page to
determine for ourselves how far the
old hatreds of 1923 had survived.
“You’ll come?” said Archie. “You’re
everybody’s friend now.”
“What’s that?” said Billy. “What’s
that? I’m my only friend, brother!
Except.” he added. “God —who has
always been on my side, brother.”
The Hughes of Whyte’s book is only
the Hughes of the newspapers and the
political pamphlets. The real Hughes
still needs an analytical biographer
with access to State and private papers
and to sources of personal knowledge
as yet untapped in an organised way.
M. H. E.
Poems by E. G. Moll
It is a curious fact that though the
overriding effect of Ernest G. Moll’s
Poems, 1940-1955 (Angus and Robert-
son) is of a genial, a happy poetry, like
a warm day in the bush, the theme to
which he recurs over and over again,
so that it seems to be the principal
statement he is concerned to make, is
the singularly ungenial theme of
cruelty to animals: man’s cruelty and
Nature’s cruelty.
There are too many of these poems.
They are felt, but not deeply felt; and
when they are not deeply felt they are
sentimental. They are written to a
formula; and, like so many short-stories
of cruelty to animals, they are rather
an unfair trick to play on the reader,
who is invited to partake of country
pleasure and then, like one of Moll’s
own sparrows and rabbits, trapped.
They fall under the august displeasure
of Matthew Arnold, who said that
“mere misery, unrelieved hopelessness”
was not tragic; and of Yeats, who said
that “passive suffering” was not a
subject for art. Movement and depth
can come only when pain and death
are seen not merely as lamentable facts
but as a mystery.
Why, then, do these poems, in spite
of the repetition of this theme of pathos
and cruelty, as a whole give pleasure?
Partly because the warmth of the
earth persists through the pathos.
Partly because Moll often balances his
sentimentality by a recognition of
necessity. Partly because he still has
a great many poems simply on the
pleasures of country life —as when he
sits down comfortably and talks to the
old gumtree;—
I the man and this wried wood,
Hump to hump, as old friends should,
Squat and talk and watch them run,
Stretched up thin to catch the sun.
Partly because his American style,
easy and colloquial, deriving from
Frost and Robinson, enables him to
make a fresh approach to Australian
themes. And partly because in some
of the poems, such as “Death of an
Old Sheep-dog” and “To a Dying Wild
Cockatoo,” the facile pathos does
deepen and expand into tragedy:—
Or, while your wings stiffen and
quiver,
Is it all inwardly dark
With the wet ground under, the
stubble land round you,
And I who found you,
Seen by your brain’s last spark,
A crouching monster of life from
whom
You slip, with your heart turned
stone and your eyes grown
stark,
Into the sheltering gloom?
This collection contains the five
books which, beginning with “Cut
From Mulga” in 1940. Professor Moll
has published in Australia. It includes
the long sonnet-sequence “The Water-
hole” and the Miltonic narrative
“Jonah at Nineveh.” Both of these
contain some admirable writing, but it
is in the shorter country-pieces, some-
times humorous and sometimes tragic
and always close to the earth, that the
best work is to be found.
Navarre
The old kingdom of Navarre
straddles the Pyrenees and the present
borders of France and Spain, and
Nina Epton has plenty of memories
to revive and observations to make in
her travel-book. Navarre, the Flea
Between Two Monkeys (Cassell).
Its best-known man, of course, is
Henry, who considered Paris “worth
a Mass,” and became Henry IV of
France; and, in her sojourn at Pau,
Miss Epton digs up a great deal of
the gossip about Henry and the love
of his early days, “Corisande,” and
how badly he afterwards treated her.
But the best parts of the book are
the stories of the author’s attendance
at ancient rituals: the 6000 ft. ceremony
of the Tribute of Cows on July 13 at
the Frontier Stone of the Col St.
Martin, for instance, in which, annually
since 1375, the French villages on one
side have given three cows to the
Spanish villages on the other side, an
affair of mayors in ancient costumes
which is followed by feasting and
revelry.
Another ceremony is of the jota-
dancers of Salazar, who, after a special

Mass in a church high up on a hill,

encierro of Pamplona, where youths
and young men in white shirts venture
their lives by running before the bulls
released from their corrals to run
through the city streets to the bull-
ring:—
Most of these lads have not had
any sleep for days. Some of them
have drunk a little too much wine
.... They are inclined to behave
foolishly and to taunt the oncoming
bulls. This can be fatal and it is
also contrary to the rules of the
encierro. The orthodox runners,
those who take part in the encierro
year after year until their family
responsibilities rob them of their
dare-devilry, keep on running and
never look back.
Then there is Roncevaux, scene of

The Emden
The “enterprise,” “daring.” “extra-
ordinary skill, audacity and heroism”
of Captain Karl von Muller was cele-
brated by the English papers in
announcing the destruction of his ship;
even Sydney, says A. A. Hoehling in
Lonely Command (Cassell), “com-
menced preparations to welcome von
Muller comparable to a Broadway
ticker-tape parade. His glory even
overshadowed their own Captain
Glossop’s,” whose H.M.A.S. Sydney
had sunk von Muller’s Emden.
In the three months before November
9, 1914, when Glossop got him, von
Muller captured or sank 24 merchant-
ships without harm to their passengers
or crew, destroyed two enemy warships
and raided two Middle East shore-
installations.
The book seems to suggest that the
Sydney need not have returned to
shoot at the Emden when she was
beached on the coral at North Keeling
Island, already battered to bits. The
Sydney was twice the Emden’s size;
her 6in. guns were to the German
4.1 in. guns “as a shotgun to a boy’s
air-rifle”; her speed of 26 knots was
at least a knot faster than Emden’s.
But how to calm a cruiser when its
blood is up? Von Muller had avoided
being sunk; not only this, but he hadn’t
struck his flag. The Australian salvoes
ceased as soon as von Muller’s cabin-
servant shinned up the shell-scarred
mainmast and fixed a piece of white
linen in the place of the flag; and
whether von Muller had the flag burnt
“as a final proof of submission and
degradation” or as a denial of that.
too, to the enemy is a matter of
opinion.
As it was, the Australians missed
the first-officer, von Muecke, with three
officers and forty men, who had landed
at Direction Island to destroy the cable-
and wireless-station, and had been
unable to rejoin the Emden when the
battle opened. This produced the most
bizarre story in the book, as told by
von Muecke:—
I now took my station on the
roof of the highest house to watch
the fight between the two cruisers.
As a whole, the Englishmen showed
little interest in the conflict that
was going on but a few thousand
metres distant from the island....
With an ingratiating smile one of
them stepped up to our officers, who
were head over ears in work down
on the beach, and asked: “Do you
play tennis?”
The escape of von Muecke and his
company in the rotten-bottomed
schooner Ayesha makes an extra-
ordinary end to the Emden story. Not
only to escape, but to meet-up in the
Indian Ocean with the Choising, the
Emden’s collier which had never
reached her, and continue on it to
Hodeida, on the approaches to the
Red Sea, then by dhow to Leet, and
over the desert, fighting battles with
Bedouins, to Haidar Pasha across the
Bosphorus from Constantinople, still
free and among German allies, ranks
von Muecke with the greatest escapers
of modern times.
Reviewed Briefly
With a foreword by R. G. Menzies,
Harry Hopman’s Aces and Places
(Cassell) deals individually, in Part I,
with some 20-odd stars, most of whom
are of post-1945 tennis, and, in Part
11, with the Davis Cup tournaments
1950-56, when “Hop” was Australian
non-playing captain. In all it is a
comprehensive survey of world tennis
for the decade to the end of 1956, and
there’s also behind-the-scenes know-
ledge of one or two controversial
incidents of recent years, such as
whether or not Hoad and Rosewall
really signed-up with Kramer in 1955.
On one point only has Hop himself
been aced, by Hoad—his very last
sentence is “As 1957 opened he
[Hoad] did know that he did not want
to be a professional during that year.”

Two useful reprints for the novice,
with points of interest for the expert,
are The Quest of the Trout, by R. L.
Blackwood, and Canary Breeding in
Australia, by C. Kirby, both from
Robertson and Mullens. Blackwood
discusses gear, methods of casting,
“Where the Trout Lie” (out of reach
under the far bank), dry-fly, wet-fly,
spinning (tut) and live-bait (tut tut).
Kirby has all about breeding, feeding,
showing and curing the ailments of his
small feathered friends, with additional
chapters on hybrids and Australian
finches. Anglers intending to buy the
fishing book should be careful not to
get the one on canaries, which will
be of no use to them, and vice versa.

Bitter Lemons: Lawrence Durrell
(Faber). A most interesting book on
Cyprus, probably the best account of
the present troubled state of that
lovely island we are likely to get:
Durrell being, of course, not a journalist
but a writer. He went to Cyprus in
1953 simply to continue writing his
series of impressionistic travel-books;
found himself in the midst of a revolt
and eventually took a job as a senior
Government official; so that the book
is a mixture of first-class travel-
writing, time-bombs and guerrillas.

This
pot-hole is costing you money!
You are paying millions of pounds a year for
Australia’s thousands of miles of crumbling, out-
moded roads and congested city streets.
Whether you’re a car owner or not somewhere
along the line you are paying for Australia’s pot-
holes and other road deficiencies. When a truck
carrying a load of produce from farm to market is
damaged by a pot-hole, you pay for it. You pay
again when traffic congestion and other hazards
cause transport delays. The increased costs for
needlessly wasted fuel, greater maintenance and
depreciation costs and higher insurance premiums
are eventually passed on to you.
It is estimated that the cost of freight is 6/- in
every pound you spend on consumer goods. Experts
agree that this is twice as high as it should be and
the main reason is bad roads. Don’t you agree then
that it is time we did something about our bad roads?
Australia has the engineers, the manpower, the
ingenuity and all the means to build good roads.
Now we need a blueprint for further action.
An Australian National Roads Authority, a single
body backed by the necessary powers and funds,
could be the first step in bringing our roads into
line with today’s . . . and tomorrow’s requirements.
Such an Authority could co-ordinate the plans of
existing State and shire road-making bodies, who
are doing their best under great difficulties to keep
our roads open, so that our road construction pro-
