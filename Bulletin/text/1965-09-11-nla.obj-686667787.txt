OVERSEAS is vital to Australia
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills does both, and this
Australian-owned company is a large contributor to the economy and
prosperity of Australia.
In 1938, for the first time in the world, printing and writing
papers were produced at Burnie from short-fibred Eucalypt pulp.
Today, more than 3,000 people are producing some
100,000 tons annually to supply most of Australia’s requirements
in fine papers. There are "Burnie” and "Ballarat” papers
for personal stationery, Government usage, school exercise and
text books, printing, publishing and special wrapping.
This local production effects a very substantial saving in imports
and so conserves Australian overseas funds. To further assist
the nation’s trade balance, large tonnages of “Burnie” and
"Ballarat”’ papers are exported to South East Asia and other
foreign markets.
Constant quality control, intensive product research and the skill
of Australian workers ensure that the "Burnie” and “Ballarat” brands
rank as world-quality papers.

National Notebook
figurehead
“ A h, Mr Kerr, you are a cartoonist’s
J*- dream,” one of the delegates to the
[Commonwealth and Empire Law Con-
ference in Sydney told John Kerr, QC.
Kerr, a massive man with a head of
white hair which makes you grope for
.“leonine”, then reject it as inadequate,
appears indeed to be a Man of Distinc-
tion.
( President of the Law Council of Aus-
tralia, Kerr was a natural figurehead
for the conference. But although the
conference, of course, involved a great
ideal of work by many people, Kerr be-
came so enthusiastically involved that if
jit had been humanly possible, he would
ihave personally shepherded every one
'of the 2000 delegates in and out of Syd-
ney and in and out of every session.
It was suggested that he had given over
two years of his time to ensuring the con-
ference’s success. This seems unlikely,
jin the past 12 months he has appeared,
iamong others, in the “total wage” case
(before the Arbitration Commission, in
the case involving the Speaker of the
NSW Legislative Assembly, Mr Ray
Maher, for the cattlemen in the North-
ern Territory cattle industry award hear-
ing and for the four members of the staff
of “Oz” magazine in their appeal against
a conviction of publishing obscenity.
I The conference was, undoubtedly, a
isocial success with delegates beetling all
around Sydney’s waterways in perfect
spring weather. It also secured a remark-
able amount of space in the daily papers.
But how far did it go in its purpose of
getting the law to “look at the challenge
of the 20th century”?
Mr Kerr was prepared to go along
with criticism that the level of papers and
discussion wasn’t always particularly
high. “However," he said, “this was not
a seminar at academic level with people
presenting an original piece of work. It
[was just a conference of practitioners,
[exchanging ideas and experience. Any-
thing that emerged came out of the push
and pull of debate. There were no re-
solutions and no votes.”
Mr Kerr felt, too, it might be true that
the conference seemed overweighted with
[judges, law ministers and attorneys-gen-
pl. “This might just be something to
Watch for the future,” he said. “But every
delegate comes as a private person. If
• s We do get, say, a law minister speaking
oa the Commonwealth Court of Appeal,
jtt is useful to know what his Govern-
ment’s policy may be, but no statement
as political and no government is com-
mitted by what a delegate says.
: “The next conference is in New Delhi,
and no matter what the political situation
is between, say, India and Pakistan, the
host country must be prepared to
ask members from all Commonwealth
countries.”
Unparalleled Venom
’IJETTth the Sydney Symphony Orchestra
and the Australian Ballet about to
descend on London, bent on cultural
conquest, it is melancholy to have to
report that Australians are definitely out
of fashion there this season, or perhaps
it’s only this month or this week.
Fashions don’t last long in London these
days.
Hal Porter’s play “The Professor” was
savaged so severely by the critics after it
opened at the Royal Court that even one
critic was surprised. After daily paper
critics had said Porter’s play was “pre-
posterously silly” and “as unlikely a tale
as one has ever encountered on the
British stage” and that Porter had com-
mitted “murder in the theatre” and
“theatrical hara-kiri”, J. W. Lambert in
“The Sunday Times” wrote:
“There have been, I won’t deny, weeks
in the London theatre when Hal Porter’s
play ‘The Professor’ (Royal Court)
would not have forced its way to the top
of the bill. It does so now not in the
least because of weakness in the opposi-
tion but for two more positive reasons
its merits and its mystery.
“Its mystery lies in a quality, un-
perceived by me, which has caused it to
be written and spoken about in terms of
almost unparalleled venom. I concede
that ‘The Professor’ is never likely to be
ranked along with Sophocles, Shakespeare
or even Tennessee Williams. But it seems
that lurking somewhere within its com-
monplace shortcomings is some far
darker quality, which has spilt vitriol
down newspaper columns and caused
several acquaintances to scorch me with
the sparks of hatred showing from their
impassioned eyes as they denounced the
work in an apparently instinctive (cer-
tainly unexplained) revulsion which
corrodes their pens, pinches their nostrils,
twists their lips and gives their voices the
timbre of so many enraged hyenas. Yet
with all its faults, it is not, as might be
supposed, an outrage, an insult to the
British theatre, a blot on the face of the
capital and a disgrace to the dignity of
man.”
Meanwhile, on home territory Porter
has been getting a much milder doing-
over, following publication by Rigby of
his book “Stars of Australian Stage and
Screen”. This is just what the title says,
but Porter had selected stars according to
methods and preferences all his own, ,j|J
"Hurry up, we've a deadline to meet."

Late in the Day
'T'he first return appearance of Miss
Joan Sutherland in her home-town
last week was judged something of an
anti-climax. Although the opera tour so
far has provided more than a fair share
of surprises for J. C. Williamson’s, this
may not have been one of them. Wil-
liamson’s take it for granted that any
show which opens in Sydney dies in Mel-
bourne, but the reverse is not quite so
relentless. Still, Sydney seemed to be
getting Sutherland pretty late in the day.
The orang-outangs couldn’t quite make
up their minds how gala the premiere
was. It probably all depends on what
part of the jungle you live in. Page 3 of
the “Telegraph” sighted its first tiara at
6.50 and its first ermine at 6.55, but
judged the dressing as “not as good as
the first night of ‘Mary Poppins’.” On
page 24 it was “the most elegant premiere
in years”. Page 1 of the “Herald” report-
ed that “only about one in 10 of the
men wore full evening dress” and spotted
“only one or two tiaras” but page 12’s
verdict was “the best-dressed first night
in years”.
The first-night audience seemed re-
markably and gratifyingly high in opera-
lovers and low in Sunday-paper socialites.
A surprising number of people came
alone. There was the solid core of
Sydney, often overlooked by the enter-
tainment industry. They came to see,
not be seen; to hear, not overhear.
They were there again in the near-
capacity house for the opening night of
the non-Sutherland “L’Elisir d’amore”,
clapping and cheering enthusiastically, a
little relieved after the solemnity of the
first Sutherland appearance. They will
remember the Sutherland season when
all the fracas between Richard Bonynge
and the Press at the Four Canoes is long
forgotten. It is almost forgotten now.
There was silliness on both sides. Silly of
the Press to say that Miss Sutherland
“owes” anything to the Press. She and
the Press owe each other nothing. Ex-
cept, of course, courtesy.
Mystery of Our Time
Come months ago in Melbourne Brian
Fitzpatrick was honored at a dinner
attended by a number of leading political
and public men. Representatives of most
political attitudes were present, including
members of the Communist, Labor and
Liberal Parties, the most eminent among
them being Mr Harold Holt.
The dinner of honor was in due time:
Brian Fitzpatrick is now dead. With
him has died something of Australian
intellectual and polemical life, some-
thing more of the “generation of the
’thirties”, and a great deal of the heart
and mind of what is the Old Left.
Fitzpatrick attended Trinity College at
Melbourne University, worked on news-
papers, returned to the University for
a time as a Research Fellow, wrote
books and numerous articles, and
founded political magazines. He spent
much of the latter half of his life free-
lance writing, editing his “Labor News-
letter”.
A man of winning Irish-style personal
charm, he had a strong influence on a
generation - and -a - half of Melbourne
academics, writers, Left-wing politicians,
and artists who gathered around such
institutions as the Council for Civil
Liberties, the Rationalist Society, and
the old Swanston Family Hotel.
It would, however, be no honor to
him to evade the central mystery of
the man in his death. The mystery is
this: How could a man of such fine
personal qualities of generosity, charity
and courtesy, a man whose labor was
often herculean in the cause of civil
liberties and in the defence of the
oppressed of the Western world have
been so long a victim of Stalinist propa-
ganda?
It is a mystery deep at the heart of
our time.
Tasmania's Plan
Cenior staff members of the University
of Tasmania are pushing to have the
university become the Australian head-
quarters for Colombo Plan students.
If approved, the University council will
submit the proposals for consideration by
the Universities Commission when it
visits Hobart later this year. Tasmania
has been suggested as the students’ head-
quarters because of the already over-
crowded mainland universities.
Supporters of the proposal consider the
benefits to the students will be great, and
certainly in Hobart they could benefit
from individual attention. Having the
students in Tasmania would also help the
university to bring its enrolment to the
4000 mark considered economical.
A Union Man
TT is considered bad manners to predict
honors from the Queen, but in the
case of lan Francis Beaurepaire, who
has become Lord Mayor of Melbourne,
the issue is decided. It will be routine
for him to become Sir lan or Sir Francis
in 1967, in his second term in office.
This is the ritual of the Council.
Only three things could get in the
way. One would be illness or demise.
Another would be the return of a Labor
government. The third would be some
indiscretion by the new Lord Mayor
which might offend the mighty clique
of 22 civic group councillors who
dominate Melbourne Town Hall (and
ignore all protests by the 11 Labor coun-
cillors). All three events are unlikely.
Councillor Beaurepaire, at 42, is fit and
well. Labor is not within sight in State
politics. And the Lord Mayor is of one
mind with his supporters on the im-
portant things of life.
Councillor lan Beaurepaire is the son
of the late Sir Frank Beaurepaire, one-
time Olympic swimmer, who founded
the Olympic tyre business and its
affiliates, was Lord Mayor of Melbourne
in 1940-42, and was a leader in the
movement that got the Olympic Games
for Melbourne in 1956.
lan, only son of Sir Frank, went to
Carey Baptist Grammar School and
Scotch College. He joined the RAAF in
1942 as an armorer and later became a
Kittyhawk pilot in New Guinea and the
Islands.
GAGGING THE PRESS
ffij%ulCetCn
80 Years Ago: September 19, 1885
JN Australia the law demands from any
one who proposes to print his thoughts
in a cheap periodical fashion, so that
the poorest may benefit by them, that he
shall first give heavy securities for his
good behavior such behavior to be
gauged by the authorities whom it may
be his highest duty most vehemently
and persistently to attack. Nothing more
infamous could well be conceived. This
piece of legislation was repealed in the
old country in 1869 Charles Bradlaugh
with his National Reformer having, the
previous year, defied it to do its worst.
In Australia it has been a dead letter
too for the most part until now, in Mel-
bourne, where it has been revived at the
bidding of the priests who have always
striven to keep a gag on the Press.
Joseph Symes, the Freethinker, has for
more than a year been printing and pub-
lishing a paper called the Liberator in
the city of the Cup Carnival. More than
80 papers in Victoria are issued, like the
Liberator, regardless of the infamous Act,
and without a ticket-of-leave from the
Government. But they do not make free
with the sanctuary as Joseph does. Hence,
it is at Joseph, and not at them, that the
police are set.
Let each newspaper register its respon-
sible publisher, so that if an offence be
committed the offender may be known; but
giving security for good behavior is only
worthy of a community of convicts.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Escalation in Kashmir
rpHE tragedy of the Kashmir situation
*■ may be best summed up in this
way: India’s position is legally and
morally indefensible but strategically
unanswerable.
Legally India barely has ar leg to
stand on. When the United Nations
force imposed a truce 'n 1949, India
and Pakistan agreed that .a plebiscite
should be held to settle Kashmir’s
future status. Since then India has
consistently refused to hold the plebis-
cite, has successfully lobbied to keep
Kashmir off the United Nations
Security Council agenda, and, despite
its earlier pledges, has unilaterally
integrated its part of Kashmir into the
Indian Union. Morally India’s position
is equally weak. Although officially
committed to non-violence, India has
maintained its rule in Kashmir by
force and it has not managed to win
the Kashmiris’ loyalty. Regardless of
Indian claims, a plebiscite would
clearly lead to Kashmir becoming
either a pro-Pakistan independent
State or a part of Pakistan.
But in this tragic situation we are
not awarding marks for good or bad
moral or legal behavior. We are con-
cerned with India’s survival as a free
country and with the survival of a
free world. The crucial point is that
India cannot and must not abandon
a country as strategically important
as Kashmir while the Communist
Chinese threat is so great and so im-
mediate. The Indian Prime Minister,
Mr Lai Bahadur Shastri, finally made
this clear last week when he said
that India must and will retain control
of part of Kashmir even if the whole
world condemns her. To allow Kash-
mir to become independent or part of
Pakistan, while Pakistan is, in its
foreign policy, so much a Chinese
ally, would be to risk handing a vast
strip of strategic territory over to
Chinese influence. This Indian position
must command Australians’ sympa-
thetic support.
Although the only possible policy
for India’s and Pakistan’s allies is to
try to bring the parties to a cease-fire,
passions are now so aroused on both
sides that each day this becomes in-
creasingly difficult. The Pakistan
Army demands a show-down with
India, and the Indian Army, having
suffered defeats at the hands of the
Chinese on the border and of the
Pakistanis in the Rann of Kutch,
would welcome an opportunity to
prove its “superiority” by trying to
defeat Pakistan. An enraged public
in both countries is in no mood to
talk peace.
A clue to the state of Indian public
opinion is a recent speech by the elder
statesman C. Rajagopalachari, who
has never feared to take up an un-
popular position criticising all of
India’s established heroes and policies,
the Congress Party, the late Mr Nehru,
the policy of non-alignment, the ideal
of socialist planning. Yet he, too, did
not oppose the anti-Pakistan hysteria
and even 'called for an all-out war
on Pakistan. Such a development
would be utterly disastrous. It would
ruin two countries that should be
investing in economic development,
not war, and facilitate China’s expan-
sion which India’s claim to Kashmir
is largely meant to contain.
Yet despite the mounting hysteria,
India’s and Pakistan’s allies must still
use every possible means to bring
peace to Kashmir. plebis-
cite must be held and that means that
ultimately Kashmir will be incorpor-
ated in Pakistan; but until the Chinese
threat is reduced and Indian strength
increased, it is pointless to demand
that India give up this territory. The
best that can be hoped for is a cease-
fire and India’s acceptance of the
principle of a plebiscite in the long
run. The United Nations successfully
intervened in 1949 and might now do
so again. Britain successfully inter-
vened in the Rann of Kutch and might
do so again. America is an essential
ally of both India and Pakistan and
can legitimately use its influence. Aus-
tralia is an established friend of both
and must use whatever influence it
has. The alternative to peace is appal-
ling— for India, Pakistan, Australia
and the world.
Celluloid Evidence
T'he arrival this week in Australia of
A the celebrated American script-
writer Mr James Poe, who will pre-
pare a screenplay for a Hollywood film
on the life of Captain Cook, and the
recent visit of Mr Mickey Rooney with
plans for a film called “Lost in the
Bush”, once more highlight the non-
existence -of an Australian feature film
industry. The point is that both Mr
Poe and Mr Rooney are involved in
projects which will rightly be regarded
internationally as American films, and
the question remains: How are Aus-
tralian directors and writers to prepare
indigenous motion pictures?
The argument usually boils down to
one over Government sponsorship. The
most cogent of the arguments against
Government sponsorship is that insuf-
ficient talent has so far been displayed
in local productions and that therefore
the Government may be assisting in
the production of inferior work which
can only reflect badly on the country
as a whole. The argument for Govern-
ment sponsorship is that, without it,
there can be no climate of film making
in which new talent may emerge and
promising young film-makers will con-
tinue to leave the country.
The issue can only be settled in
one way. Those new film-makers who
have talent and drive should, in com-
mon with their contemporaries in
Europe (and American film-makers
outside Hollywood), obtain funds from
those enthusiasts, who must number
themselves in thousands, to produce
independent films. Ten pounds a head
raised from, say, a thousand people
would be enough to finance a good,
little film, providing of course and
there is no point in mincing words
that the promising talents in the coun-
try combined their efforts on the pro-
duction and that the crew, like their
overseas counterparts, worked for
next to nothing.
The release of such a film to the
international festivals would prove how
much talent there is in the country,
and how it can operate on the most
slender resources. There would then
be a case for taking the film (assuming
it has been internationally acknow-
ledged) before a meeting in support of
that Government sponsorship which is
so often talked about in a vacuum.
The trouble until now has been that
the argument for local films has had
little in the way of worthwhile cellu-
loid evidence in support of it. One
or two brilliant little films could be
more eloquent than any number of
high-sounding declamations.

EDUCATION
Who Will Fire the Teachers?
The fight for seats on the Education Commission?
C. CUTLER
ELIZABETH-MATTICK
By BRIAN JOHNS
The forthcoming elections in the New South Wales Teachers’ Federation will
be of the gravest importance not only for teachers but for parents throughout the
State. It will decide whether moderate or Leftist and Communist representatives will
sit on the proposed Education Commission which will have power (at present held by
the Public Service Board) over the appointment, transfer, promotion and dismissal of
teachers in NSW State schools.
The Teachers’ Federation has cam-
paigned long and vehemently for the
establishment of this Commission. In his
policy this year the third election in
which a Commission was promised as
Liberal policy Mr Askin said:
“Teachers will have equal representation
on the Commission with Government ap-
pointees, and they will function under an
independent chairman of proven capa-
city.” The Teachers’ Federation also
claims that Mr Askin told a deputation
before the last State election that two of
four Commission representatives would
be nominated by the Federation, and
that “there would have to be agreement
between the Federation and the Govern-
ment concerning the chairman if the
scheme were to work.”
Government members, now having
second thoughts about the composition
of the proposed Commission, believe that
an Education Commission set up on
these lines would deliver a frightening
amount of power on policy into the
hands of Communist and extremist ele-
ments in the Teachers’ Federation and
are hoping mightily that the Left-wing
leadership of the Federation is defeated
by the moderates in the coming Federa-
tion elections.
From the Teachers’ Federation record
there is no doubt of its Leftist orienta-
tion. The Federation assured the success
of last year’s Communist-front Sydney
Peace Congress by providing 67 of the
sponsors, or about 12 per cent. Sixteen
of these 67 sponsors were members of
the Teachers’ Federation Council and 27
members of the Council attended the
Congress as delegates.
In June this year the Federation’s
Council made a much bolder move by
recommending affiliation with the organi-
sers of the Peace Congress, the Associa-
tion for International Co-operation and
Disarmament. After Press controversy
and confronted with unexpectedly strong
rank-and-file protests, the affiliation move
was rejected on July 3.
In June the Federation executive also
decided that the Federation should con-
tribute to the holding of a World Con-
ference of Organisations of the Teaching
Profession a democratic body in
Sydney in 1970, provided invitations
are issued to organisations affiliated with
the Federation Internationale Syndicale
de l’Enseignement (FISE), which is affili-
ated with the Communist - controlled
World Federation of Trade Unions.
The Teachers’ Federation will also at-
tempt to reverse the ACTU’s withdrawal'
from the WFTU at this month’s Con-
gress. The ACTU —at present affiliated
with the non-Communist International
Conference of Free Trade Unions-Avil]
be asked to endorse a Federation call for
the merging of all trade unionists into
“one v orld organisation”.
The Federation’s decisions to forged
closer links with Communist-directed ini
ternational organisations followed the at-
tendance of the Federation’s senior vice-
president, Miss E. M. Mattick, at a con-
ference in Algiers in April organised by
the FISE.
But the Communist orientation of thej
Federation goes a long way back. In
pamphlet, “Communism is Treason”,
J. T. Lang devotes a chapter to the NSW
Teachers’ Federation in which he claims
that the “First direct public acknowledg-
ment of the interest that the Communist
Party was taking in the Teachers’ Federa-
tion came at the 1932 Teachers’ Con-
ference when it was announced that the
Friends of the Soviet Union a Com-
munist auxiliary was prepared to pay
all expenses for a teacher to visit the
Soviet Union”. Lang included in his
pamphlet excerpts from Hansard of ques-
tions he had asked and speeches he had
made in Federal Parliament alleging that
the veteran Federation president, Mr
S. P. Lewis, was a well-known Com-
munist and “holds an important position
in the inner Communist organisation in
Australia”. Mr Lang also claims that at
one period Mr Lewis used the alias oi
Sam Curtis in Communist circles.
But the very size of the Federatio/
apparatus leaves it wide open to manipuj
lation, which is made easy by the deejj
apathy among the Federation’s. 30,00(;
members. The Council should be electee
by ballots among the 216 groups 143
of which are in the country but in
practice interest is at such a low ebb thaf
few ballots are held (last year there were
only four). Naturally, this apathy works
in favor of the ruling group.
The task before the candidates con
testing the coming election will be M
break this apathy. It was last done <j
decade ago when the Right, organised b;j
a primary-school headmaster, Mr Emit
Bray, defeated Mr Lewis in an election
for president.
In November all top three position!
will be contested. Mr Lewis is being op
posed by a Liberal, Mr S. Kelly, a teacheii
in the Sydney suburb of Fairfield, ant
Mr G. Stanton, an ALP member. Tfej
deputy president, Mr W. J. Whalan,
Miss Mattick, both closely
with Mr Lewis, will be opposed by Mr J
Jeffreys and Mr H. Boyle, a Liberal 1
The Education Minister, Mr C. Cutler,;
will be only one among many anxiously
awaiting the results.


TRADE PRACTICES
Mr Sneddon’s Epitaph
Freezing the Bill
By J. C. HORSFALL
With Mr H. Bolte, the Victorian Premier, cold on the idea of complementary
State Trade Practices Legislation, and Mr Billy Snedden, the Attorney-General, fight-
ing for his ministerial life, after a consistent display of administrative ineptitude, it is
unlikely that Cabinet will push the Federal Trade Practices Bill through this year.
In the meantime, while Mr Snedden
keeps grasping at the shadow of his Bill,
more evidence is accumulating that a
compliant system exercised through the
existing legal system would suffice to
protect the public against anti-social trade
practices. Provided complementary legis-
lation to the Australian Industries Preser-
vation Act could be passed in the States,
and cases coming to the notice of the
Attorney-General pushed with more
vigor, it is highly probable that this old
Act, passed in 1905, could do the job.
. J
It is unlikely that such a course would
be pm to the test by Mr Snedden, whose
infatuation with his unsatisfactory Bill
has blinded him to the duty of prosecu-
ting cases under the old Act. This was
seen in the unresolved affairs ot Heine
Bros, the Canberra grocers, rubber goods
traders and lohn Rowan, the Jindara
publican, against various monopolists.
Passing through Jindara last week one
saw the closed doors of its one and only
pub as a possible epitaph to Mr Snedden
Time mav well be running out for Mr
Snedden and his Bill, but at the eleventh
hour he should at least take a look at an
instance of an allegedly unwarranted re-
striction ot trade which came to notice
at Euroa. in north-eastern Victoria, last
week. This would seem to be an ideal one
for a testing of the old Act.
The gist of this case is given in the
foregoing letter from E. D. Kenny Pty,
Ltd, to the secretary of the newly formed
Farme s Co-operative Fertilisers (Euroa)
Ltd. Briefly, it is alleged that ICIANZ
cancelled Kenny’s agency for Common-
wealth Fertilisers (a wholly owned sub-
sidiary of ICIANZ) because of Kenny’s
activities with the new Co-operative. The
letter runs as follows:
“You will, no doubt, be interested to
hear that the local representative from
ICI called yesterday morning and in-
formed me that as from today our agency
with the Commonwealth Fertilisers was
cancelled because of our activities with
the Farmers’ Co-operative.
“This, of course, places us in an awk-
ward situation as regards future supplies
of super, but we are endeavoring to
come to some arrangement with the
Griffith Producers Co-op., to obtain
supplies through them as distributors for
Commonwealth Fertilisers. When we
threw in our lot with you, 1 discussed the
possible repercussions with my son Ted,
and we decided that it was worth the
effort, if only to keep the monopoly in
iine. Apparently the results of your
drive for shareholders have upset the big
boys and they did not take long to
retaliate
“Although this will probably affect us
BILLY SNEDDEN
H. BOLTE
financially, it will, no doubt, give you a
sense of satisfaction to know that your
efforts must be causing a certain heart-
burning amongst the Melbourne crowd.
Congratulations on your efforts and the
results achieved. We trust that all will go
well and that we will see some real
activity shortly.”—Signed, E. D. Kenny.
Now, Mr Snedden, what are you wait-
ing for?
HANOI
The Two-lane
Bridge
That dirty word
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
Robert Rose became national news in
May when he applied for a visa to
attend the “International Trade Union
Conference for Solidarity with Vietnam”
in Hanoi.
Vice-President of the Newcastle
branch of the Waterside Workers’ Fed-
eration, and a member of the ALP, Rose
protested strongly against the “denial of
his democratic rights” when the Federal
Government refused him a visa for
North Vietnam. He applied for a visa to
visit Hong Kong, but withdrew his ap-
plication when the Acting-Minister for
Immigration, Mr Bury, asked him to sign
a statutory declaration declaring that he
would not go to Hanoi from there.
This was on the eve ot the departure
of Australian troops for South Vietnam,
and the Federal Government stated that
the grounds for its action against Rose
were that no Australian citizen had the
right to a passport in order to help a
foreign power organise resistance to the
military action of Australian troops.
The Waterside Workers’ Federation
established protest machinery on behalf
of Rose and threatened to strike, but
took no further action when word was
sent around that it did not need to send
over a runner to the conference because
a party of five Australian union officials,
already in China, had passports which
would allow them to attend. When these
officials returned they assured the nation
that the aims and attitudes of the con-
ference had been entirely peaceful and
not in any way connected with the Viet-
nam war. As one said, “It was a meet-
ing to build bridges of friendship
amongst the workers of South-East
Asia.”

Q 2968
Mr N. Wallace, ol the Communist-run
Victorian Builders’ Laborers’ Federation,
complained about remarks which had
been made questioning the loyalty of his
delegation to Australia. He added that
his chief impression of the conference
was that aid for South Vietnam was giv-
ing Australia a bad name in Asia.
A radically different picture of the
Hanoi conference appears in a recent is-
sue of “Letter from China”, a Com-
munist-Chinese propaganda magazine. It
is written by the ex-American journalist,
Anna Louise Strong, who is now resi-
dent in China, and who was a Chinese
delegate at the conference.
In general, the picture painted by
Miss Strong is that of a conference dom-
inated by an ideological battle, between
Moscow-inclined and Peking-oriented
Communists, ovei the issue of how much
deeper and wider the North should ex-
tend the war. Her report leaves no doubt
about the intentions of the Hanoi organ-
isers of the conference “They wanted,”
she says, “moral and material support
from all progressive forces in the world,
including money and weapons.”
Of the scene in the conference hall
she writes: “The delegates from some 60
nations and organisations held only a
couple of hundred seats in the front of
the hall, not even one-sixth of the total
space. Around them, at sides and rear
and in the gallery, sat a daily changing
audience of local Vietnamese —applaud-
ing in the right- spots and desperately
wanting the world’s organised workers’
unanimous support for the struggle in
Vietnam. They wanted this to strengthen
men on battle-fronts a thousand miles
to the South.”
She castigates the Moscow-directed
delegates for being “embarrassed by the
war” and sneers at “peaceful co-exist-
ence” and the Moscow-line “World
Federation of Trade Union officialdom
who came to bring peace”. “These aims
they never dared publicise in Hanoi, for
in Hanoi ‘negotiation’ was a dirty word.”
Dr. Jim Cairns and Mr. Arthur Cal-
well would be interested in the following
remark quoted by Miss Strong from the
mouths of the North Vietnam leaders:
“If we cannot win in a year, we will
fight for ten. If this generation cannot
accomplish it, the next will carry on.”
On the question of volunteers for the
Communist army Miss Strong concludes:
“For the present they did not wish to
bring in foreign troops for their own
troops were familiar with the terrain . . .
they took on their own backs the task
of liberating and unifying the country.”
There was a bitter struggle between
the Moscow and Peking delegations over
the drafting of the final resolution,
which, when it was at last drafted, en-
couraged the workers of the world to
send the North money for arms.


EDUCATION
Catholic Moment of Truth
A sort of traitor?
The Melbourne Catholic diocesan weekly, “The Advocate”, recently
headed an editorial about the grim realities of the Catholic school system,
“A Moment of Truth”.
It was referring to a seminar at
Melbourne University’s Newman Col-
lege, which it described as “perhaps
the fullest and frankest discussion of
the ‘crisis of Catholic education’ in
this State and the country at large
that has yet taken place.” Character-
istically, Sydney’s “Catholic Weekly”
was more cautious. In a page 10 story
on the seminar, it reported that
Catholic students had “a slightly
higher pass rate” in the matriculation
examinations than other students. It
did not mention the name of Father
Brian Crittenden, the lecturer in
education at Sydney University, who
had startled many at the Melbourne
seminar by asking whether the Cath-
olic school system should be dis-
mantled.
Catholic officials in the Sydney
Archdiocese have been concerned in
recent weeks at the sort of questioning
not only of the practicality of main-
taining a Catholic school system but
of the validity of the basic principles
of Catholic education. Shortly before
Cardinal Gilroy left to attend the final
session of the Vatican Council in
Rome, he asked the priests in his
Archdiocese to preach on Catholic
education at all Masses on Sunday a
few weeks ago. The sermons followed
articles in the Press by a layman ask-
ing, “Are Catholic Schools Neces-
sary?” '
Another expression of concern was
seen in Father J. K. O'Reilly’s
“Catholic Weekly” advertisement for
one of his art unions. The advertise-
ment included quotes from statements
by Cardinal Gilroy and Pope Pius XI
which Father O’Reilly said showed
that “to have serious doubts about
this question (of Catholic schools) is
to be completely out of tune with the
mind of the Church. To propagate
the idea that Catholic schools may
not be necessary is surely treason”.
Coincidentally Father Crittenden,
at a lecture in Newcastle in August
entitled “Catholic Schools What is
the Future?”, had expressed the hope
that he would “not be labelled with
the term ‘traitor’, ‘disloyal’, etc.”.
This lecture, ignored by the Catholic
Press, is now in private circulation.
Father Crittenden’s first premise : s
that “the school as an institution in
society and the idea of education have
both changed so radically in the past
hundred years that Catholics must
re-think the role of the Church in
relation to schools and formal educa-
tion”.
In the re-thinking he suggested that
Catholics should realise that public
schools had become the agents
through which society expressed and
developed its unity and distinctive
character. “In the light of this it
seems that a basic question facing
the Church in the exercise of its spe-
cific education function is not how
to go about maintaining a separate
system of schools but how to promote
human values and bear witness to
Christ in the common schools of the
society to which Catholics as much
as anyone else belong.”
CARDINAL GILROY
Noting the argument which Catho-
lics frequently put forward that
diversity in education is justified in
a pluralist society Father Critten-
den said: “In practice, of course,
Catholics are the only group who
have attempted a comprehensive
separate system of education in the
Western democracies.” In Australia
this had meant that the Church had
not shown sufficient concern for the
quality of the common human values
which the public school should be
promoting.
“I do not see the future of Christian
education in continuing the crippling
effort of maintaining a separate
system of elementary and secondary
schools. I see it as involving a dif-
fusion of the vast effort —people and
finance—we have so far concentrated
... to a much wider range of educa-
tional media.” Catholics should take
the measures necessary to see that
public schools are based on genuine
human values common to the society
and to see that the schools are “safe”
not just for Catholics but for all
children.
According to Father Crittenden,
the Church could establish parish
schools of religion which would
provide special instruction and coun-
selling for parents. Separate, com-
pletely Catholic schools would only
be provided “where particular, extra-
ordinary circumstances demand
them”.

HOSPITALS-I
Glamor, but no Reward
The doctors’ trade union
The long-awaited Starr Committee report on the NSW hospital system, which
the Minister for Health, Mr A. H. Jago, received this week, might lead to some of
the “tremendous changes” he foreshadowed when he spoke recently about the need
to improve the quality of hospital services in the State.
But hospital services in NSW, and
ultimately throughout the country, will
be more influenced by an Industrial Court
ease due to resume in Sydney on Septem-
ber 20. Then, barring the unlikely pos-
sibility that the NSW Hospitals Commis-
sion might change its mind and come up
with an acceptable counter-offer, the
Hospital Specialists branch of the Public
Medical Officers’ Association will seek a
new award from a three-judge Industrial
Court headed by Mr Justice Taylor.
The hearing will be unique in medical
history and will establish precedents in
industrial negotiation and arbitration. Its
likely effects will make the ten days
which the judges have set aside for the
hearing of interest to medical and other
professional employees in every state.
After a year of abortive negotiations
with the Hospitals Commission and rep-
resentatives of major hospitals, the
specialist “trade union” is asking the
court for a new salary range, extended
annual leave, sabbatical leave, conference
leave, and special allowances. The doc-

For the purposes of the new awa
the doctors are defining “specialist”
a medical practitioner employed fi
time at a public hospital, who has h
five years of experience after graduatic
and who holds a post-graduate medic
qualification in the specialty at which :

In itself this public definition of
“specialist”, if accepted by the coui
would be of great interest and impoi
ance to the medical profession, lot
divided on just how to distinguish bi

Apart from this there is the basil
question of salary increases. The log c

at £4500 p.a. in the first year of
specialist’s service, rising to £7OOO aftc
10 years of service. At present, income

£4500.

The
Untouchables
Institutional neurosis
By TONY FARRINGTON
“And the leper in whom the plague
is, his clothes shall be rent . . . and he
shall cry: Unclean, unclean.” (Leviticus,
13, 46.)
Hidden away in the grounds of one
of Sydney’s largest hospitals is a tiny
cluster of dilapidated old buildings
surrounded by a high wire fence. Lead-
ing up to the fence is a barren dirt road,
neglected and dirty. Here six lepers, one
of whom has lived in this squalor for
20 years, exist in the shambles of old
buildings with tall chimneys standing
only because of the support of a weather-
stained coat of paint.
There are at least 1000 known lepers
in Australia and every State has a leper
hospital—but the lazaret in Sydney is
reputed to be the worst in the Common-
wealth. An article in the “Medical Jour-
nal of Australia” last year, describing
the lazaret, said the patients were suffer-
ing from institutional neurosis. The
symptoms were described as apathy, lack
of initiative, loss of interest, submissive-
ness, apparent inability to make plans
and lack of individuality. ,
Despite this and the irreparable
psychological damage the lepers have
suffered, the lazaret until now has re-
mained unchanged since it was built in
1890. Medical officers told The Bul-
letin this week that this was mainly
because the Renshaw Labor Govern-
ment wrangled over constructing new
premises for only six patients.
The officers were reluctant to discuss
the political aspects of the lazaret and
brushed it off as being history.
A tender has been accepted for the
construction of a new ward to accom-
modate the lepers. But the officers did
say that this was only being done because
the Government had dumped the lepers
into the laps of the Hospital Board con-
cerned, and after the Board of Health
had inspected the colony and reported it
was appalled that patients were being
treated in such squalor. A Sydney
doctor, specialising in tropical diseases,
said this week that the lazaret was
the worst leper hospital in Australia.
Although the new wing would improve
living conditions for the sufferers, the
psychological problems would remain.
While the disease is more common
among Aborigines in the Northern Ter-
ritory and Western Australia, the patients
at the lazaret are mostly Europeans.
The doctor said they were mainly un-
educated migrants who had lived in
extremely poor conditions. Some of
them came for treatment from the
Northern Territory, where they were
believed to have caught the disease.
As well as the lazaret patients, the
doctor said there were at least two
dozen out-patients in Sydney and scores
more out-patients throughout Australia.
But this did not present the possibility
of passing on the disease because it was
difficult to “catch”. If discovered in the
early stages it can be cured—although
those Europeans who had suffered before
from leprosy usually preferred not to
report it for fear of “life isolation”,
According to one doctor, when a
person is “sentenced” to a leper colony
he must, as he nears the high wire fence
and high gate, realise that he is perhaps
being sentenced to a life of “imprison-
ment”. To a person walking along the
earthen road to the lazaret it must seem
his life has ended, and it is here that the
patient stops planning his life and adapts
himself to aimless idleness and un-
inhibited loneliness.

Rolex watches
You know their names as you know
your own. You know their faces
from a thousand newspaper and
magazine articles. You have seen
them and heard their voices on
newsreels and on your television
screen. Their actions and decisions
influence the pattern of our lives.
We cannot mention their names,
or show pictures of them. It would
not be fitting to do so, for they
include royalty, the heads of states,
great service commanders. But we
invite you to look carefully at the
next pictures that you see of them,
at their wrists as well as their faces
and clothes. You will notice that
in almost every case they wear a
wrist-watch. That watch will
most likely have been made by
Rolex of Geneva.
We are proud of the service given
by Rolex watches to so many
eminent men throughout the
world. It is scarcely necessary to
point out that the performance of
these watches is, in the highest
degree, accurate and dependable.

CIVIL RIGHTS
To the Oasis
Newly committed
Aborigines are at last rallying to their own cause. Civil rights, once the province
of student demonstrators and isolated Aboriginal leaders, has become the catch*
phrase of increasing numbers of committed Aborigines.
The charging of an Aboriginal man
and woman early last month, who were
attempting to desegregate the lounge of
the local picture theatre in the New
South Wales town of Walgett, with ob-
struction, is believed to be the first time
Aborigines have been arrested in a civil
rights demonstration. Groups of the
town’s Aborigines continued protesting
about discrimination at the cinema un-
til the proprietor drew up a lengthy
document agreeing to admit Aborigines
on an equal basis with whites.
Another target of local Aboriginal
protest was the sudden exclusion on the
second Saturday night in August of
Aborigines from Walgett’s Oasis Hotel,
where the town’s native population had
been accustomed to drinking in the pub-
lic bar. The publican, Mr A. White,
imposed the complete ban when an Abo-
riginal drinker, testing his right to enter
the hotel lounge, resorted to violence.
The publican has since eased the hotel
ban, but he encouraged Aborigines to
sign a petition protesting against agita-
tors from outside the town. The petition
was clearly aimed at a group of Sydney
University students who helped initiate
the unrest about conditions in the theatre
and hotel, four of them being arrested
for obstruction before the group return-
ed to Sydney.
However, the organising spirit behind
Aboriginal stirrings in Walgett is closer
to home. Local Aborigine Mr Harry
Hall, as president of the Aborigine Pro-
gressive Association, has organised meet-
ings among the one thousand or more
colored people and has been prominent
in all the latest efforts against discrimina-
tion. Hall is a candidate for the Town
Council elections. His stand is in direct
opposition to those of the town’s Abo-
rigines who claim there is no discrimina-
tion in Walgett. There were Aboriginal
hecklers of the recent desegregation
efforts.
The arrival in Walgett at the end of
last month of over 25 Aborigines from
Sydney clearly indicated that the Abo-
rigines were fighting their own civil rights
battle. A well-known identity in the
Aboriginal movement, Charles Perkins,
said before he left Sydney with the party:
“The students have done as much as they
can. The Aboriginal people in Walgett
must carry the fight now. If they do
this they’ll get support from Aborigines
all over the State. It’s only natural that
a few Aborigines are reluctant. Some
people don’t like to rethink their situa-
tion their relations with the white
people. They are uncertain about what
will happen in the future. Many have
been threatened with the loss of their
jobs. But they are beginning to realise
that they’ve got to stand up for their
rights and we feel we’ve got to give them
moral support.”
JUDITH RICH
TRANSPORT
Flat-footed
Trial for the movement
The duel between the NSW transport
unions and the Government, which be-
gan as the first industrial test for the
new Askin-Cutier administration, has
slowly turned full circle into a trial for
the trade union movement itself.
The question now is not whether the
Government will crack, but whether a
break-away will occur within the unions.
The testing time will come this week
when officials of the 26 unions involved
in the dispute, which has already re-
sulted in two 24-hour stoppages, meet
at Sydney’s Trades Hall to decide their
next move. Although there are no
direct signs of a split within the unions,
an undertone of dissatisfaction is evident
at both rank and file and official level.
The crack could easily have come at
a gathering of unions when the “final”
compromise offer under which the
unions would have received increases
of up to 17s. 6d. a week after three
years was considered. Although the
offer was rejected, and a determination
expressed to continue to go flat out for
their original demand of up to 495. 6d.
a week, there were some feet dragging.
This week the Electrical Trades Union
is counting a ballot of its 2000 members
in the Government’s employ to find
rank and file opinion whether the dis-
pute should be continued. If the men
come down against further industrial
action then the veneer of unity within
the unions will have gone, for others
will certainly follow the ETU lead. It
could be that the only major industrial
dispute in the NSW railway service
since 1917 could fizzle out, temporarily
at least.

The Next PM?
McEwen is building up Hasluck as a rival to Holt
From ALAN REID in Canberra
The struggle for power now developing within the Liberal-Country Party Federal
coalition government is important for two major reasons among many.
The first major reason is that the
struggle could decide who are to be
Australia’s top political leaders in the
immediate future. The second is that,
with Sir Robert Menzies refusing to say
whether he is going to quit or stay in
the Prime Ministership, there is uncer-
tainty about the coalition leadership and,
as Australian political history has
repeatedly shown, when there is this sort
of uncertainty, the always-present poten-
tial for disintegration in a coalition gov-
ernment expands almost inexorably.
Menzies triggered off the struggle on
July 13 last. Newly returned from over-
seas, he was asked about rumors of
his retirement. He did not discount the
rumors, he fed them. He said that he
was giving thought to his future and
to his duties, and that, after reaching a
conclusion, he would announce his
decision. He has not announced it yet,
and so the struggle he triggered off is
continuing and intensifying.
Although impersonal forces are at
least as important as the personalities
involved, the struggle tends to centre
around personalities. The two most
important personalities are undoubtedly
the Treasurer, Harold Holt, and CP
leader John McEwen.
After years of association which, in
Menzies’ case, has been marked by a
determination to maintain the coalition,
McEwen and Menzies seemed to have
reached an understanding on how far
each can safely push the other.
But Holt is a different proposition.
Despite a surface aura of good fellow-
ship he lacks flexibility. He has clashed
several times with McEwen, particularly
recently on foreign investment policy.
As a result, while McEwen accepts
philosophically a government dominated
by Menzies who has flexibility and no
dedication to the proposition that the
Country Party should be eradicated
electorally, he would not be nearly as
philosophically passive towards a govern-
ment dominated by Holt. Accordingly,

he can promote a rival to Holt in
the Liberal ranks, or he can build
himself and his party into such a posi-
tion of strength that he will be able to
extract from Holt concessions, in the
shape of additional or more key minis-
terial appointments for the CP, and
thereby limit Holt’s dominance in the
Cabinet room.
External Affairs Minister Paul Has-
luck appears to have been selected for
building up as a rival to Holt. Hasluck
would undoubtedly suit McEwen and the
CP as a Prime Minister better than
Holt. A reasonable expectation would
be that Hasluck would tend to concen-
trate upon the area of Government
administration in which he is most
interested international affairs. CP
reasoning is that this should, or would,
give the CP a more uninhibited go in
domestic matters with which the CP is
primarily concerned.
The choice of Hasluck is shrewd in
one way. Though not an inspiring plat-
form orator and inclined to dogmatism,
Hasluck has a hard core of integrity
recognised even by those who disagree
with his views. He has a small but
influential group of admirers within the
Liberal Party. But he displays no per-
sonal interest in
the struggle and
if he is making
any attempt to
ingratiate himself
with his fellow
Liberals (which I doubt), he is going
about it in a singularly unenterprising
manner.
Another individual whom forces within
the Liberal Party rather than his own
personal inclination are trying to push
into the top bracket is Supply Minister
Alan Fairhall. The forces here are
partially those trying to break down
Victorian domination of the inner
Cabinet, and include NSW elements who
are against Minister for Labor Wil-
liam McMahon improving his position
by moving into the Treasury in a Holt
administration. But Fairhall had his
political fingers burned as Interior
Minister. He was dropped completely
from the Ministry in a Cabinet shuffle
as a result. He gives the feeling that
he is quite happy to restore his
administrative reputation in the satisfy-
ingly busy but relatively unpolitical
Supply Department before wanting to
resume his climb towards the always
dangerous political peaks.
Control of the Treasury is the key in
the power struggle. If a NSW Minister
gets it, it lessens Victorian dominance.
The CP has regretted its loss ever since
it passed from CP to Liberal hands
One word from Menzies . . .
when Sir Arthur Fadden retired in 1958.
Personally I cannot see the CP getting
it back. The only CP member who could
aspire to it would be John McEwen
himself and, to take it, he would have
to yield up the Trade portfolio which
he now administers and which is pos-
sibly even more vital to CP interests.
McMahon, the senior NSW Minister
who has the technical qualifications as
well as the seniority, would be the
obvious one to take over this key post.
His Budget speech last week was
thoughtful, reasoned and effective, and
Ifriany Liberals claimed it enhanced his
Treasury prospects. While Holt himself
might be happy to see McMahon in it
(and the Liberal Party Deputy Leader-
ship) in return for NSW support for
him as Prime Minister, there are some
Victorians who, if they cannot get it
for Victoria, would sooner see it go
anywhere than to NSW.
The only Liberal alternative to
McMahon as Treasurer might prove
to be the present PMG, Alan Hulme.
Hulme, a Queenslander, has (like
Defence Minister Senator Shane Palt-
ridge and Shipping Minister Gordon
Freeth in Western Australia) shown him-
self actively opposed to CP interests.
The CP would
not want Hulme
but, on the other
hand, if Hulme
moved into
Treasury, the CP
would have a chance of getting back
the PMG.
This power struggle has a signi-
ficance which goes beyond moves within
the Liberal Party and between the Liberal
and Country Parties. Labor’s Left wing
is watching with absorbed interest. The
ALP Left wing has long worked on a
theory that it does not have to win
electoral support, that Australian political
history shows that a Liberal-CP adminis-
tration carries always within it the seeds
of its own disintegration. Working on
this theory the ALP Left wing has con-
centrated on maintaining control of the
ALP machine and using the machine to
replace Right-wing Labor parliamen-
tarians with Left-wingers who can be
relied upon to accept and execute the
machine’s directions.
The irony of the whole situation is
that Menzies could halt the struggle
and dissipate the present strained atmos-
phere at least temporarily by a few
words. If he said that he had no inten-
tion of resigning, this would enable
Ministers to concentrate upon administra-
tion instead of the power ploys which
are now their inevitable preoccupation.


Where I Stand
A personal statement on Vietnam
By GEOFFREY FAIRBAIRN
This article is the text of Geoffrey
Fair bairn's address last week to a
Sydney conference of the Australian
Council of Churches.
Mr Chairman, Reverend Sirs: I believe that the Americans and Australians in
South Vietnam are fighting for world peace, and I propose to explain why 1 believe
that. I do not stand here as some tame apologist for the present Government. 1 have
again and again attacked what I believed to be its insouciance about the great issues
in Asia. 1 have many times criticised its attitudes towards Asians.
I have a kind of foster-son —for years
while he grew to manhood I was in
effect his foster-father who lives in
Burma near the Chinese border and I
am conscious all the time of the dangers
that he and his Australian wife and their
children face today. When I speak
about guerrilla warfare 1 do not speak
as an academic. At every local dis-
cussion such as this one, a large part of
my mind is in other places: the road be-
tween Kutkai and Namkham where that
great medical missionary Segrave worked
until he died in the hospital that he and
his wife and his sister built with their
own hands out of stone laboriously
moved from the Shwe-Li River, the
border between Burma and China. It
was on that road that the Shan Burmese
family, of whom I am an honorary
member, learned that guerrillas had the
same day inadvertently killed their small
niece. They were not Communist guer-
rillas.
I keep remembering the faces of
my Arakanese friends in Western Burma
the day the Burmese Army an army
representing a very Left-wing govern-
ment had bombarded a village, killing
some innocent people, in order to attack
local Communist guerrillas. I remember
the frightened faces of rubber tappers
in Malaya during the height of the Com-
munist insurrection in Johore in 1951
and remember my own fears as the very
brave Welsh plantation manager drove
me .through the shadowy lines of the
rubber plantation, where his assistant had
been killed not very long before. I re-
member the gentle face of a Vietnamese
Army officer, seconded to civilian duties
in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in
1962, and the frightened young—oh, so
very young faces of his militia boys
as they awaited attack from Vietnamese
Communist guerrillas. Indeed, I even
keep remembering a day 20 years ago
when I went up-river behind the Japanese
lines in Borneo: remember the fear on
the villagers’ faces lest our operation be
unsuccessful and bring Japanese reprisals
upon them. J also remember a little boy
on a beach in the Philippines a little
earlier: his right arm a bandaged stump,
the result of our bombardment earlier »n
the morning . . . oh, no, I loathe both
guerrilla war and the methods involved
in its putting down.
I simply see no alternative to the
American commitment in South Vietnam
and our support of it. For this is not an
attempt by the West to put down an
indigenous peasant rising, “a response to
economic and political conditions” as
some intellectuals believe. What is hap-
pening in South Vietnam is not only an
invasion through methods of revolution-
ary guerrilla warfare: it is part of a
grand design by China to alter cata-
strophically the balance of world power.
And should it succeed then world war
is virtually inevitable.
Contained by the wills of free men in
Western Europe, the Soviet Union has
been forced to take stock of its position
and of the realities of the thermo-nuclear
balance of terror. It turned its energies
towards social betterment, towards a
hitherto undreamed-of humanism,
towards a real effort to co-operate in
keeping world peace. China acted differ-
ently. China is biologically unafraid of a
nuclear holocaust. China talked, and talks
today, in terms of war “as the highest
form of struggle” “war will become a
bridge over which mankind will pass into
a new era of history”. A “beautiful new
future”, according to this viewpoint, will
be built upon “the debris of a dead
imperialism”. I do ask you, most humbly,
if we have not in such a viewpoint a
truly terrible threat to world peace?
Have the Americans ever talked in those
terms? I ask you at this point to remem-
ber that American airpower could to-
morrow, in a matter of hours, reduce the
Red River Delta of Tonkin to a raging
flood, against which the energies of the
Vietnamese people have been bent for
over 2000 years. Instead of doing this,
young Americans are dying in and
around Maquis D, around Chu Lai, Da
Nang, Dak Sut, Kontum, Pleiku—dying
individually near places whose names are
probably unfamiliar to you. The Ameri-
cans could end the war tomorrow by
bombing the river control system of
North Vietnam. They do not do so. Do
you really believe the Chinese would not
do so if the positions were reversed?
I must confess to finding the present
situation here rather eerie, rather un-
real. When the campaign against South
Vietnam was launched through means of
revolutionary guerrilla warfare, there
were very few Americans indeed in Viet-
nam. The number of village officials, and
their wives and their children, assas-
sinated or kidnapped each year by the
Vietcong vastly exceeded the number of
American advisers. I hope that the
churchmen protesters against American-
Australian involvement today protested
against those murders and kidnappings.
Otherwise quite clearly a double stand-
ard of morality is being insinuated upon
the Australian public. When over 50.000
North Vietnamese were executed after
atrocious public humiliations 1 hope the
protesters of today publicly protested—
since this was the inevitable consequence
of Communist victory in the North, as
it will be in the South. I hope protesters
are aware of what will happen to sup-
porters of the South Vietnamese Govern-
ment should the Communists win. I hope
that when the state power of the North
Vietnamese Communist society trained
artillery upon the protesting peasants of
Nghe-An, Ho Chi-minh’s home province,
the clerical protesters of today protested
then; and when Hanoi University was
closed down in order to prevent some
kind of teach-ins. Otherwise a double
standard of morality is being imposed
upon Australian citizens.
Now today I refuse to get side-tracked
into technicalities. I would rather put
this to you: South-East Asia is compos-
ed of new nations that might well be
supposed to favor Communist ideas.
They all have, in varying degrees, mem-
ories of humiliations imposed by West-
erners. They have all discovered disa-
bilities in themselves, since independ-
ence, so far as modernising techniques
are concerned. They are all disappointed
by their own political and economic
achievements, and so they are all only
too apt to talk in terms of an economi-

cally dominating neo-colonialism (and
there is truth, economically, in this talk).
They are chiefly Left-wing in point of
social policy. But nowhere have the pre-
sumably “higher ideas” of Communism
issued in a Communist government by
popular acclaim, through elections.
The chief reason for this is that they
are peasant countries and they know
by now that Communism is a vast con-
fidence trick perpetrated against peas-
ants. They know that where Com-
munism successfully grows out of the
barrel of a gun, the peasants are herded
on to collective farms as State slaves. The
result is economically appalling. For ex-
ample, the per capita production of
grain in the Soviet Union was higher in
1913 than in 1961 (Mr Khrushchev’s
figures, not mine). The same thing hap-
pened in North Vietnam after the Com-
munist conquest of 1954. Production
in the South grew by 20 per cent, it
dropped by 10 per cent in the North.
I look forward to a day when China,
when the great energies of Chinese
civilisation are forced back by the wills
of free men to the task of bettering its
own people. 1 look forward to the
day when the nations of South-East Asia
—Left-wing and Right-wing—are united
in the common purpose of harnessing
the Mekong River. I look forward to the
day when an Australian Peace Corps
will be active in the villages of South-
East Asia.
I>ut first the Chinese “line”, the Chin-
ese attempt to extend violence of a
brilliantly systematised kind throughout
South-East Asia, Latin America, and
Africa, must be repulsed. Peace depends
upon this repulsion. Hope depends upon
this repulsion. This repulsion simply
must not be stayed on its way by the
neuroses and double standards of mor-
ality and political gormlessness. I am
not prepared to stand in some apolo-
getic stance, even before such an aug-
ust audience as this, ft is we who repre-
sent the open future for the hearts and
minds of men and women we, not
the totalitarians. By “we”, I do not have
to add that I mean those South-East
Asians who are fighting and bleeding
and dying the South Vietnamese arm-
ed forces have suffered casualties equiva-
lent to those of Australia during World
War 11, fighting for the freedom to
choose their future. I want to quote a
man who once symbolised the dour, en-
during decency of free men, Winston
Churchill: “Never give in. Never, never,
never, never. Never yield to force and
the apparently overwhelming might of
the enemy. Never yield in any way, great
or small, large or petty, except to con-
victions of honor and good sense.” ~
After all, we are back in 1938 now.


Radio’s Talk Jockeys
Off the top of their heads
By CHARLES HIGHAM
IT begins around 6.30 in the morning,
with a private landline broadcast
from a flat in Kirribilli, Sydney.
Then, in two or three-minute bursts, the
hearathon continues on and off until
9.00 a.m., when the listening begins in
real earnest. From then until 10, Andrea
interviews celebrities and exchanges
banter, knowing or risque, with John
Pearce; Eric Baume comes next, taking
the side of the underdog, quietly brusque
and gruff, interrupted occasionally by
his pseudonymous legal adviser, Sidney
Carton; from 11.05 until 12, Gordon
(“Charlie”) Chater and Gwen (“Pussy”)
Plumb giggle, natter, or collapse wheezily
into helpless laughter, as they plough
through Press clippings, letters, and
entries for competitions; then, at noon,
the news again, followed by Ann Deve-
son a milder, slightly less waspish
replacement for Carolyn Berntsen, now
back in her native America—until 1.30.
Switch to television: “Beauty and the
Beast” (another answer-to-listeners pro-
gramme with a panel of four women and
Eric Baume) is followed straight away
by Dita Cobb, wide-eyed and gushing,
with (at time of writing) a rather cowed
Stuart Wagstaff trying to score points
off her and someone-or-other-with-a-
name brought on as her companion or
victim. And in the evening, Dita Cobb
and Terry Dear, Baume and others once
again tear news and letters apart with in-
exhaustible loquacity.
Now that the folkie craze is beginning
to look rather sick, the talkies are
flourishing, beaming triumphantly from
magazine covers, picking up hundreds
between them a week. The fad, though
(contrary to some reports), isn’t new; m
fact, compulsive chatterboxes have been
a feature of Sydney radio for years.
2GB, which has a virtual corner in the
field, long ago had its “prince of story-
tellers”, Ellis Price, who read novels,
taking the parts of the characters speak-
ing the dialogue (his throaty females
were particularly memorable). 2SM had
the splendidly named Dr Rumble, and
2CH the durable Frank Sturge Harty,
a kind of male Dorothy Dix, conducting
an aural Miss Lonelyhearts column. Del
Cartwright, no less ready with answers
for every known human problem, also
starred on the same station. Characters
like 2GB’s Bimbo and Uncle George (as
long ago as the 1920 s and early 19305)
and Frank and Ernest in more recent
years had rapt followings. And Meg
McSpeerin probably holds the world’s
talkathon record in this kind of
thing: for about thirty years she
has delivered news and notes for her
Women’s League members on 2CH, in
a briskly breezy manner which shows
no sign of flagging with each successive
decade.
The new talkie fad is, in fact, some-
thing of a Second Wave. The old-time
rage for quizzes most notably Jack
Davey’s and Bob Dyer’s—on radio, for
the Frank Sturge Hartys and the Del
Cartwrights of the time, died temporarily
in the mid-1950s when transistors came
in almost simultaneously with the
emergence of rock-’n’-roll. Teenagers
collared the field, transistor sets made
radio mobile, and the main listening took
place in cars and on beaches and around
the house where young people would
move from room to room at parties. In
the late ’fifties, the rage for loud, belted
rock-’n’-roll reached its peak, Col Joye
and Johnny O'Keefe were in their
gaudiest heyday, and a raw (and, one
must admit, pretty exciting) vein of
music was thoroughly explored by every
disc jockey worth his salt.
Then, gradually, there came signs of
a decline in the teenage music craze,
and nothing really as dynamic has arisen
in its place. The talkies are the nearest
to being that, and 2UE, which for years
had been top-rated station because of its
exploitation of rock, for a time did well
with Andrea and Gordon Chater. But
both gave the station a headache; their
often ribald, near-the-bone type of con-
versational matter made executives hot
around the collar, painfully conscious of
possible moves by the Broadcasting Con-
trol Board to take away their licence.
But 2GB was more daring.
Stan Clark, managing director of 2GB,
had already taken over Andrea (and had
Eric Baume and Carolyn Berntsen on
the payroll) when, in 1964, he suddenly
saw a way to escalate the talkie business
into a craze. Studying New York and
Los Angeles markets that year, he found
that stemming from a genius called
Robert Hyland in St Louis “talking
concept programmes” were building
rapidly on local stations.

time been the top-rated station there,”
Clark told me. “Operated by RKO
General, they had 15 minutes of news
in each hour and the remaining 45 were
taken up with personalities, one or two
at a time, talking from 9 a.m. solid until
midnight.” He decided to adopt the
policy here, but not to make it quite
a morning-to-midnight format. “We

Bach, no rock-’n’-roll, and increased the
half-hour talk programmes we had to
55 minutes. This type of programming
was in sufficient volume to create an
image,” Mr Clark beamed. “We became
the top-rated station.”
What, I asked him, did he think was
the appeal of the programmes? “The
psychology of the programmes is that the
microphone personality is not talking
down to you but you are eavesdropping.
This takes away the feeling of pomposity
you’d get if you were being talked at.
It’s as though you were in a restaurant,
overhearing a conversation.” And what
was the individual appeal of each of his
talkers?
Censoring the talkies
“Andrea —well, she has a quaint and
fascinating way of expressing her-
self. Her background is very interesting,
she really has met famous people. She
has an air of first-hand knowledge.” But
wasn’t she a bit sophisticated for her
audience? “Well, you mustn’t forget the
public is much better educated than it
used to be. As Dr Wyndham pointed
out in a recent talk to the Rotary Club,
only 17 per cent passed the Leaving a
few years ago. Now it’s 24 per cent.
“Dita Cobb’s appeal? I’d say it’s just
good fun. Pussy and Charlie the same.”
How did their popularity stand,
relatively? “Roughly in descending order
according to their timeslot. So it’s
Andrea top, then Eric Baume, then
Pussy and Charlie, and so on.
“Of course, I don’t mind admitting
that although we’re top-rated station our
operation with the conversation pro-
grammes is also the most expensive. You
can’t get people of this kind of calibre
for peanuts. In the old days, a man like
Jack Davey would be underwritten by
commercial interests. But we pay for
these people.”
Had the charges been increased for
commercials? “No. We simply get more.
And we felt that while we were getting
this increased volume of business it
would not be advisable to increase in-
dividual charges.” All the talkie pro-
grammes are unscripted; 2GB does some
censorship (of near-the-bone humor
mainly) and for this reason some of the
programmes cannot go on live; so far
this has precluded the phoning in of
“live” questions from listeners a com-
mon practice in America.
The salaries for most of the personali-
ties are said to be more than £IOO a
week: Andrea gets slightly below £l5O,
but £lO a week for every week of
retirement for life; Eric Baume is said
to get about £135 a week, and so on.
Of the personalities, Andrea seems the
most immediately striking and durable:
a woman of considerable sophistication,
her career has included activity as a
suffragette, marriage with a scatty adver-
tising agent, who took a gun to their bed,
and a San Francisco socialite who died
of drinking wood alcohol during Pro-
hibition, a period in Hollywood (as an
extra in Cecil B. DeMille’s “Ten Com-
mandments” and as support to Valen-
tino), imprisonment in the war and
years as a “Daily Mirror” columnist. “I
started my radio programmes at 2UE
about six years ago,” Andrea told me.
“First of all with a script, but they
threw that out and told me just to let
rip. I did. On my opening programme
I said Nola Dekyvere worked for charity
but she also made charity work for her.
She sued me for £25,000, but when the
lawyers got together they laughed the
whole thing out of court.
“I always felt nervous at 2UE. You’d
go up and see the big bosses and you’d
feel those cold, cold eyes and know you
were going to be carpeted. It’s nice at
2G8.” She had been offered £l5O a week
to go back to 2UE but had refused it.
What, I asked her, did she think kept
her so much at the forefront? “I don’t
talk down. That makes a difference. I
don’t like the pompous thing, you know.
The garbos call out to me, ‘Hello,
Andrea, you were bloody terrible yester-
day morning.’ And at the same time I
might get a listener among the big brass.”
She made a swooping gesture with her
hand. “I go all the way along the social
scale, you see.”
A facelift some years ago had done
good to Andrea’s career, and Dita Cobb
perhaps her greatest rival as a per-
sonality on radio today had literally
been launched with her “face-warming
party” in 1964. Taut, quick and
shrewdly wide-eyed, Dita Cobb gives an
impression of militant feminism which
frequently colors her column and broad-
casts. On the air and on paper she dis-
closes a number of other prejudices
which endear her to a large audience of
women. She loves animals, has a fond-
ness for “in” socialite haunts like the
Bull ’n’ Bush, the Silver Spade and
Chequers. She claims to know nothing
of politics, displays a vestigial interest
in art not specialised, not Philistine
(names like Leonard Hessing and Bob
Dickerson have been dropped) in her


column, has criticised teenage music
(while carefully exempting 2GB from
the charge), and exudes a perhaps cal-
culated air of brassy but daffy sophistica-
tion. The appeal in her programmes
is obviously escapist: housewives can
imagine themselves Up There, meeting
the famous, while still feeling she’s one
of them because she has debts, a weak-
ness for expensive clothes, and a sharp
(but not prissy) attitude to men, whom
she depicts as less efficient drivers than
women, voracious proposers of marriage
(or worse) or, at best, necessary evils.
How, I asked her, had she begun her
radio career? “On North German
radio. I'm not a German, by the way,
I’m a Jew. My most memorable assign-
ment was interviewing the head of a
nudist colony. He was terribly old and
hideous. I asked him why he was a
nudist. He said, ‘Because the human
body is the most beautiful thing in the
world.’ And do you know the funniest
thing I ever saw in my life? Two nude
men playing table tennis.”
She had married a White Russian who
hadn’t felt safe in Europe and had
arrived in Melbourne on AnZac Day,
1950. “It was like the end of creation.
We lived in a converted woolshed hostel
two miles upwind from a boiling-down
works. My husband, who loved grog,
was put on a job packing empty glasses
into crates. I went for a position as
a spinning operative, whatever that is,
wearing a fur coat and a terribly affected
English accent. The foreman at the mill
took one look at me and told me I wasn’t
well suitable for the job.”
Later, after a divorce and a brief return
to Europe, she had gone to a party at
ATN’s Richard Croll's house. “After the
party John Pringle asked me if I'd like
to go on ‘Beauty and the Beast’. I said
what as? But 1 went on . . . and I had
my chin lifted ... At a face-warming
party afterwards there were some photo-
graphers. Next day I got seven phone
calls to tell me I was on the front page
of ‘The Sun’.
Close to the bone
“Dome men were working outside the
house and had cut off my water
supply. So I scrubbed my teeth in hot-
water-bottle water and rushed off to ‘The
Sun’. They offered me a column. I said,
‘lt takes me six months to write a letter.’
I couldn't face sharing Sunday with the
Reverend Gordon Powell and God but
they insisted I did. Soon I had a regular
column ... I was getting between 225
and 275 letters a week . . . then the
radio programme and then ‘Cobb's
Column’ on TV. The articles, darling,
take three quarters of an hour to W’rite
... I shouldn't tell you that, should I?”
What was the secret of her appeal?
“I’m honest and close to the bone.
Closer to the bone than most people. I
don’t mislead them ... I talk about my
wigs, my false eyelashes, my age . . .
and sometimes I’m even quoted in the
Press. Even the critics liked my remark
about Joan Sutherland being ‘all chin
and chinchilla’.” Was politics really a
mystery to her? “Yes, purely mysterious.
But I like the idea of ideals pure
ideals—like Christianity and Communism
. . . and I do think Australian politicians
spend too much on their holidays and
too little on pensioners.”
Eric Baume, by contrast, discussed
politics, but he himself, he said, sub-
scribed to no political party. His “This
I Believe” had been going from the early
19505, and his 2GB News Review as
early as the 19305. He had, he said,
always been criticised: before the war
for his attacks on Hitler; later for his at-
tack on enemies of State Aid for educa-
tion and on the vicious potato prices of
a few years back.
Did he have religious views? “I
belong to no religious sect. I hate bigotry
in any form. I'll say only that I'm a
Deist and believe in Jahweh.” No
political views at all ? “No, I’ve no fixed
beliefs. My father was a Cabinet
Minister and a KC, a Whig fighting the
Tories. But —I used to talk with Hannen
Swaffer in London about this—a com-
mentator can’t have any political bias.”
None? “Well, I'll say this, I am anti-
communist (a) because I don't under-
stand it and (b) because I don’t think
Communism is an answer to anything.
I don't think any Australian is a Com-
munist in the true sense. Oh, I did like
one. Jim Healy.” Baume stood up for
the underdog, of course. “Yes, but look
here. 1 m not St George fighting the
Dragon . . . What am I? I'm a kind
of ombudsman.”
Gordon Chater and Gwen Plumb saw
their roles differently; they just wanted to
entertain. Chater, worldly and amusing,
and Plumb, the harassed housewife, are
very effective radio contrasts, and their
show full of chortling good humor,
competitions and free-wheeling talk
must appeal strongly to housewives in
need of distraction from ironing or other
chores.
Andrea with her sophisticated back-
chat and “high life” interviews; Baume
with his sharp-tongued aggressiveness
against browbeaters of the under-
privileged; Dita Cobb with her “little
me in the big leagues” routine, sharp-
tongued feminism and expertly cal-
culated gush; Pussy and Charlie with
their jolly stories and jokes and helpless
laughter; all seem to be here to stay*
and to be fulfilling a very definite need.
Can they go on across the air waves
forever? Stan Clark of 2GB thinks so,
and he has WOR's durable example in
New York to back him up. If there are
any housewives who haven't succumbed
to the talk jockeys, they'd better. The
talkies aren’t going to be gagged ny
falling ratings —at least, not yet.


Citizen Barassi
After 100 minutes , a study in the agony of fatigue
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
In northern States the passionate intensity Victorians display for football is
regarded as an amusing minor national scandal, not to be taken too seriously: there
is clearly a suspicion that somebody’s leg is being pulled, that the whole frenetic
business is some kind of joke shared only amongst Victorians. The Barassi cult gives
the lie to this view.
To people interstate Ron Barassi may
be just an Australian Rules footballer,
even a famous footballer; but for Vic-
torians Ron Barassi is an institution and
a symbol, a kind of apotheosis of foot-
ball.
Earlier this year the whole State was
thrown into confusion when Barassi, the
captain and hero of the Melbourne Foot-
ball Club, the man who roused them,
cheered them, drove them on to victory
in half a dozen Grand Finals, accepted
a £9OOO three-year contract to transfer
and become Carlton’s captain-coach.
The headlines followed in daily pro-
cession: “Carlton Name Barassi as
Coach”, “Melbourne Angry at Carlton
Offer”, “Blues Apologise to Demons”,
“Barassi Confident of Clearance”, “De-
cision on Barassi Expected Tonight”,
and finally “Barassi Cleared to Blues”.
It was a bitter-generous day for Mel-
bourne and a time of some uneasiness
and doubt in a land where changing one’s
team is considered not much worse than
changing one’s religion. Barassi describ-
ed his personal feelings at the time: “It’s
going to be very hard to leave Melbourne
after all these years. This is the biggest
step I’ve taken in my life.”
Quite a keen debate was generated
over the ethics of Barassi’s decision and
the sporting or gauche decision of the
Melbourne Football Club to grant his
clearance. A number of members of the
ancient and venerable Melbourne Cricket
Club declared in an irate letter to the
Press that the whole Football Club Com-
mittee be sacked.
One of the most touching stories of the
day concerned the young Mount Wav-
erley couple, dedicated Melbourne sup-
porters, who had bestowed the glory of
the name Barassi on their large Labra-
dor dog and had to receive public as-
sistance to get a new name that would
not upset the dog and yet would keep
him in the right team.
A Member of the Victorian Parlia-
ment, who also plays wing for Mel-
bourne, cautioned those in danger of
the sin of rash judgment about the buy-
ing of Barassi’s loyalty by declaring in
his weekly column in a Melbourne daily:
“It is impossible to say dogmatically that
Ron Barassi was right or wrong in go-
ing to Carlton”. He added sagely: “If
you believe that loyalty and close friend-
ship at one club are more important than
increased independence of thought and
action, and new loyalties and friendship
at a new club, then you must say that
Ron has made the wrong decision.” The
alternative case being so obviously in-
dicated in this subtle moral exposition,
Victoria simmered down to let Barassi
face whatever consequences his choice
would bring.
Ron Barassi and his number 31 guern-
sey are the chief symbols of Victorian
football he is often referred to as
“Mr Football” for a combination of
reasons connected with his athletic
ability, football style, and physical ap-
pearance. At sft lOins and 13 stone
21bs he is more heavily muscled than
the scales suggest; playing without
sleeves he exhibits arms as thick as a pro-
fessional wrestler’s. His style of football
is best described as a variant of the
“power game”. Although he is skilful
in kicking, marking, and ball-handling,
his mode of play has become legendary
because of his ability to drive himself
with fierce energy and courage for the
full 100 minutes of a league game. There
are times at the immediate conclusion
of a match when his face is a study in
the agony of fatigue.
On the ground during a match he takes
on the appearance of a revivalist fan-
atic: eyes glowing with concentration,
breath coming in heavy gasps, the large
lower jaw projecting with the will to
victory. It is the form of a man whose
endurance is beyond measuring, whose
desire to win is without bounds, and
whose capacity to feel pain is smothered
in the drama of the match.
He is frequently at his most effective
in the last quarter of a hard match
when most of the other players have lost
pace and concentration through fatigue:
a circumstance which led an opposing
coach to remark in exasperation: “Hasn’t
that bloody Barassi got a nervous sys-
tem like the rest of them?”
A good athlete, but not amongst the
top twenty or so most talented players
of recent years, it is not so much foot-
ball skill as its combination with the
strength, endurance and will mirrored
in the grim, strongly muscled lower face
which has created the specific Barassi
image and made his name practically
synonymous with football.
Meeting Ron Barassi off the football
field is a surprise. The aggressive mas-
culinity takes on the guise of almost boy-
ish enthusiasm for the non-dramatic am-
bitions of Australian suburbia. He is es-
pecially pleased by his 18-square house
in outer-suburban Heathmont: “We’ve
been in it over three years. I stretched
my resources to the limit but I felt that

I could make the money to justify think-
ing big.
“Do you know that I put sft drains
in the garden and heaped 12 truck-loads
of soil on them?”
At work his thighs rest oddly behind
the executive deisk. The desk has two
phones and over them Ron Barassi looks
on to a large room full of office furni-
ture. He is sales manager of a firm which
sells office furniture. He has no illusions
about the fact that his position and his
sales ability come largely from his fame
as a footballer.
He also has no illusions about his
fame. He lacks the irritating false mod-
esty assumed by so many Australian
sportsmen. He knows that in Victoria
he is better known than the Premier
and at least as famous as television’s
Graham Kennedy. He enjoys it in a way
that reveals he is not beset by vanity.
“I can’t pretend that I’m a nobody and
I don’t want to. I’ve worked terribly
hard to make myself a top footballer and
I feel that the publicity is a pleasant re-
ward.”
Noblesse oblige
are other rewards. Four days a
A week during the football season, and
usually twice a week during the off-
season, he appears on television. The
year-round engagement is on a children’s
show in which Barassi manages to main-
tain his dignity despite the execrable
flavor of the whole.
The other television appearances are
on sports programmes, which in Victoria
are almost wholly given over to foot-
ball. On these Barassi’s energetic and
utterly guileless intelligence often com-
pares favorably with the astonishing
banality of most of the other profes-
sional commentators.
He also runs a column in a daily paper
and is frequently used for advertisements
and endorsements. The combined total
of his earnings must be around £lO,OOO
a year.
Barassi has something of a noblesse
oblige attitude to his success. It might
be considered that working, coaching,
training, selecting teams, chasing re-
cruits, appearing frequently on television
and establishing a garden would be
enough for any man; but he also gives
frequent talks to youth clubs and as-
sociations such as Rotary, Apex and
Lions. The talks are always about foot-
ball and football administration. He be-
lieves that the success football has
brought him brings with it the obligation
to make himself available to the requests
of what he thinks are respectable or-
ganisations.
The talks probably have the added
function of preparing him for an at-
tempt, in a few years, to make a poli-
tical career. A couple of years back he
joined the local branch of the Liberal
Party and there were strong rumors
that he would stand for the State seat of
Melbourne in the 1963 elections. He de-
cided that he could not mix football and
politics but he has the obvious intention
to attempt to make a political career
when he has stopped playing.
Personal ambition does not fully ex-
plain his interest in a political future. It
is evident when talking with him that he
feels that by devoting his enormous en-
ergies to politics he would be repaying his
debt to a society in which he has be-
come happy, moderately wealthy, and
very famous.
Brought up in frugal circumstances by
his mother after his father, also a for-
mer Melbourne footballer, was killed at
Tobruk, Ron Barassi has achieved every
ambition which he has so far set him-
self. His ambition has not stopped grow-
ing but it is now accompanied by a solid
sense of gratitude. The vocabulary of
citizenship and its responsibilities occu-
py an identifiable area of his conversa-

This compound of physical and social
drives which has produced the Barassi
footballer-citizen should have made him
the ideal under-study for present Mel-
bourne coach Norm Smith. The swift
undercurrent of feeling which had been
flowing against Smith for some time in
the Melbourne Football Club broke the
surface this year when the club dismissed
him from the coaching position. Smith
may not have been re-instated if Barassi
had been available to take over as Mel-
bourne coach.
The troika
fact that the Melbourne com-
A mittee, knowing that its conflict with
Smith could lead to his dismissal, was
unable to offer Barassi sufficient induce-
ment to stay with Melbourne suggests
that in some way Barassi did not meet
all of their sporting and social require-
ments. His particular deficiency must
remain forever a muffled echo in the
Board Room of the Melbourne Cricket
Ground. It must have been a satisfaction
for Barassi that in his first year of
coaching he raised Carlton from tenth
to sixth position on the League ladder,
whilst his old club dropped from first
place to seventh.
The Carlton committee, which is
unanimously pleased with its £9OOO in-
vestment in Barassi, believes that, if he
had not been out of the team so often
with injury, Carlton would have been in
the finals. Their defeat of one of the
finalists, Essendon, in the last of the
pre-finals matches lends weight to this
view.
The main danger to Carlton reaping
full dividends from its money is that
Barassi will continue to be harried by
injury. The wide variety of physical
movements demanded by Australian
Rules places a great strain on the legs
particularly on the knees and ankles.
When the tendons of the knees and
ankles are frequently torn they become
progressively weaker. Heavily muscled
players like Barassi are also prone to
muscular strains and lesions. However,
only severer injury will diminish Barassi’s
ambition to lead his team to a premier-
ship as playing coach.
But no physical barrier is likely to
prevent the realisation of his ambition
to use his fame gathered as a sports-
man to achieve eminence in business and
civic affairs. An unexamined presup-
position of Barassi’s view of things is
that ambition harnessed to the troika of
courage, endurance and self-confidence
can take men anywhere they want to go
in Australian public life. He may be
right.

A Doll of
An Idea
Things as they should
have been
By JAN SMITH
To those of us who have lost touch
with dolls, Barbie comes as a sur-
prise. A puny elcven-and-a-half
inches, straight as a stick in soft plastic,
she has all the warm, cuddly qualities
of a preying mantis. The post-war dolls,
looking like Gina Lollobrigida in their
pink and white finery, seemed reason-
ably female. But as far as one can tell
• a quick strip being impossible under
the prim eye of the merchandise con-
troller Barbie is neuter
She is, in short, what the label says, a
teenage fashion model. Hei tiny face is
without expression, and the eyes, staring
straight ahead, are carefully embellished
with eyeshadow, eyeliner and miniature
false lashes.
If you get tired of her existing hair,
you can buy a Barbie w'ig set, at 355. 1 Id.,
and change her over to a poodle cut,
swirl or pageboy bob. It’s simply a
matter of removing her head, screwing
on the spare, and taking your pick from
brunette, blonde or strawberry.
Then come the clothes, and this, as
they say in the best narratives, is where
the story really starts. For Barbie, being
a teenage fashion model, is no cotton-
picking budgeteer. Not tor her the
scraps from the sewing-room floor. She
wants the best, be it a satin ballgown
called Magnificence at 545. 6d., an
astronaut outfit, a skin-diving kit, a wet-
weather ensemble or a tennis dress. She
can be a fashion editress, a reporter with
a miniature camera, wig and notebook,
a student teacher, a beach girl or a
summer stock actress.
David Jones’, who claim to have the
biggest Barbie department in Sydney,
usually manage to have about 42 of the
possible 46 different outfits on hand,
ranging from 15s. 6d. to 545. 6d. As
well as the clothes, there are packaged
knicknacks labelled Fashion Frosting
Accessories, all at 11s. 6d., containing
things like shoes, spearguns, roller and
ice skates, hats, underwear and black
nylon pantie girdles.
Despite her asexual build, Barbie is
positive proof that dolls have now gone
the full cycle of history. Like her earliest
forebears, Barbie is a symbol not of
fertility but consumption; a mascot of
the acquisitive society. For children, she
is the American Dream. For mother,

the remembrance of things as they should
have been.
After four years in the United States,
Barbie reached Australia last July and
has been selling like hot cakes ever
since, the supply never quite reach-
ing the demand. She and her bud-
dies are made in Japan where her
creators, the Mattel Company, have
established large Barbie factories to turn
out both chassis and clothes. The old
Barbie doll factory, iii California, has
been converted to the manufacture of
Barbie-style children’s clothes. Barbie
is togetherness. All the family can play.
“Teenagers and even young marrieds,”
said the David Jones’ man happily, “are
identifying with Barbie. They can buy
Barbie and Ken and wear Barbie and
Ken clothes and have a lot of fun.”
Barbie, in short, has been everyone’s
salvation. “She’s a godsend for mother,”
the man explained. “In the old days a
doll was something fragile and precious.
Mother brought her out for ten minutes
at a time (presumably he meant the post-
war era, as opposed to the pre-war when
one was actually allowed to take Dolly
to bed)' and then whipped her away be-
cause she was too expensive to be
handled overmuch. But now mother can
join in the fun, too.”
And what of Little Tuppence? Sindy?
The proliferating European versions of
Barbie? “Definitely inferior,” said the
man from David Jones’. They are
cheaper, with Little Tuppence retailing
at 255., but the range of clothes is hot
as great.
Sindy, the man said, was more like
Barbie’s kid sister, Skipper, pre-teen, sub-
deb, or whatever. She wears what the
Hong Kong manufacturers call Sloopy
Joes, and does not lend herself to being
a fashion editress or a tea-party hostess.
Barbie is better, thQ. full queen-sized
bit. Sophisticated, cool as a frozen TV
dinner, she presides at junior tea parties
in pink hostess slacks and lame jacket,
relaxing, when the guests have gone,
with a portable TV, a telephone and two
pink plastic milkshakes (Leisure Hours,
12s. 6d). “Barbie,” said the man with
delicate emphasis, “teaches little girls to
be fashion conscious.”
Next year, said the man from David
Jones’, it will be small boys’ turn with
an animated figure (not a doll) called
GI Joe. You will be able to dress Joe
in army, navy, marine and air force
uniforms and equip him with rifle kits,
sub-machine guns and possibly napalm
bombs. Better still he’ll be fitted with
16 moveable joints, putting him in a
class above poor Barbie, who is rigid.
“Think how little boys will be able
to put Joe in lifelike positions,” the
man said. “They can lie him down,
scrunch him up and spread him out just
like a real dead man.”

Mr Fudge Knows His S.E.2
Toorak v South Yarra
Touring the past few years keen
social observers have noticed a
battle for supremacy between Toorak
5.E.2. and South Yarra S.E.I. As a
shopping centre S.E.I unquestionably
has taken the lead. It has more ex-
pensive and more exotic restaurants.
It has more iron lace-work and many
more coach lamps to the square mile
than 5.E.2. It definitely has more cast-
iron columns, more olde English
fronts and its continental delicatessens
out-wurst the continental delicatessens
of Toorak.
Last week South Yarra made a
major killing. It opened an olde ar-
cade, absolutely up-
to-the-minute in its
olde worldliness. It
has brand new, an-
tique Spanish street
lamps, it has gas-
style lamp stand-
ards, a dear little
Florentine fountain
that really works
with a cherub on
top, and flower
boxes hung by chains from the up-
stairs shop windows.
There are 17 shops. Upstairs there
is a sort of female reconditioning
area where ladies can get everything
from a sauna bath to manicure.
There’s an olde worlde English tav-
ern called the “Outside Inn” which
specialises in olde English recipes like
the “Smorgasandwich”, the “Pizza-
berger”, the “Tunaberg”, and yog-
hurt at two shillings a glass.
Then there’s a puppet shop with
puppet dolls for grown-ups, and lots
of little gift shops with cute names
like “Etcetera” and “Sugar Plum”.
The South Yarra Arcade was opened
by Dame Mabel Brookes, who wasn’t
letting down 5.E.2. She lives in
Domain Road, which is definitely
S.E.I.
Ah, but if S.E.I is taking a lead
commercially, 5.E.2 is still in com-
mand as Australia’s nicest, and tight-
est little luxury suburb. Last Novem-
ber, Nareeb, the last of the great
Toorak mansions, sold for nigh on a
quarter of a million pounds. It had
been occupied by two sisters, the
late Miss Gertrude Simmons and the
still living Miss Nellie Simmons. Their
father, Walter Simmons, bought the
place for them in 1906 and it hadn’t
changed since. It still had the original
furnishings, electricity had never been
put on and it was lit by gas.
But here was the point, the great
old mansion was sitting on five and a
half beautiful acres right in the centre
of the warm heart of 5.E.2. For more
than 20 years estate men had been
calling almost weekly hoping to get
the prize. The man who bought it
was Mr H. J. Fudge, a Melbourne
builder. To those of us who don’t
understand these matters the price
seems incredibly high. However, could
he sell houses at a price to get his
money back? But Mr Fudge is a brave
and enter prising
man and he knows
his 5.E.2.
About seven years
ago he bought some
expensive land at
Kenley Court just
at the back of Nar-
eeb, subdivided it
and sold four houses
for around £39,000
each. Here he
planned to do the same thing on a
large scale. Mr Fudge got occupancy
on December 1. In the next fortnight
I don’t think any staunch, breathing
Toorakonians failed to look over
Nareeb.
Then in February and March the
bulldozers moved in. Robin Boyd was
appalled at the destruction of the
famous old garden and wrote an
article headed “The Rape of Nareeb”.
Now Mr Fudge’s plan is becoming
more clear. He has divided Nareeb
into 20 lots and it will be the richest
subdivision yet in Australia.
The first four houses are nearly
completed, and although we can’t
give you the exact prices they are a
little more than £40,000 each.
The agents, R. T. Edgar and Son,
have no doubt that they will sell all
20 houses. This should mean a gross
of over £BOO,OOO and a very good
profit for Mr Fudge.
And do you know what Mr Walter
Simmons paid for Nareeb when he
bought it from James Grice, the chair-
man of the Victorian Amateur Turf
Club back in 1906? He bought it as a
going concern estate, house, furniture,
the lot. The price was £11,500.

The Larger Hope
Turning-point or another illusion?
From ARNOLD BEICHMAN in Saigon
A political journalist suddenly evi-
dencing optimism while his con-
freres are keening the G otter dam-
merung blues as here in South Viet-
nam takes a calculated risk. He
may find that his dispatches are being
spiked in favor of those from colleagues
whose pessimism is a more dramatic
synonym for the editor’s sense of realism.
My hope is that this dispatch, with its
aura of optimism amid savage battles,
will avoid so dismal a fate as non-
publication just because it argues that
the war in South Vietnam is surely reach-
ing an important turning-point in con-
temporary history, one from which we
may draw some cheer for the future.
I was here last summer when the
American military effort consisted of
15,000 men, and it is now nearing
90,000 combat and logistical troops, and
no doubt the figure will double by the
year’s end; and when the daily cost of
the American resistance was perhaps
$1.5 million a day, and it is now running
at the rate of $3.6 million a day and
will soon be $4 million. I was then, as
were others, disturbed that the Johnson-
Goldwater campaign clearly was of
greater importance to US military
strategy than the Mao-Ho strategy of
steady infiltration by North Vietnamese
regulars south of the 17th Parallel.
And I was also here when General
Kguyen Khanh, then the South Viet-
namese Premier, was demanding bomb-
ing of the North, to the intense irritation
of Ambassador Maxwell D. Taylor and
the White House. Today, bombings of
the North are as routine as a milk-run.
What I most remember, however, is
the curious incident of the hound which
didn’t bark last August. There was the
sudden bulletin on the news-tickers that
the US Fleet in the Gulf of Tonkin had
ordered its fighter-planes to strike North
Vietnam’s navy after torpedo-boats had
twice attacked an American destroyer.
In Hong Kong that week we had waited
for Peking’s reaction. A day went by,
a night went by, another day. Newsmen
tuned their transistors to Chinese radio
stations and waited. Nothing. No re-
action. It was an ominous silence and
then it became just a silence because
there was, perhaps, nothing that could be
said. Perhaps nothing could be done by
China and North Vietnam.
It is now a year later and the war has
entered a decisive phase which I believe
will test the Mao-Ho doctrine of “wars
of liberation”, or “people's wars”. A few
weeks before the US air strikes in the
Gulf of Tonkin, General Vo Nguyen
Giap, the hero of Dien Bien Phu, had
written in the North Vietnamese paper
“Quan Dio Nhan Dan”:
South Vietnam is the model for the
national liberation movements in our
time ... If the special warfare that
the US imperialists are testing in
South Vietnam is overcome, this means
that it can be defeated everywhere in
the world.
President Johnson’s evident determina-
tion about America’s police role in
South-East Asia may be giving Giap and
his mentors in Peking second thoughts
about the ease with which the “national
liberation” wars can subvert existing
countries in Asia or elsewhere.
There have been full-fledged Com-
munist uprisings in seven Asian coun-
tries since the Second World War ended.
Two succeeded —the seizure of China by
Mao in 1949 and Tibet in 1953. Three
failed—Korea, Malaya and the Philip-
pines. One is enjoying a truce women-
tone Laos. The future of the seventh
—South Vietnam—is now in the balance.
Only five of the seven can be said to
fit the “wars of liberation” rubric —-
China, Malaya, Philippines, Laos and
South Vietnam. Korea was a conven-
tional war which ended in stalemate. For
the US it was a costly police action —-
59,000 killed, 103,000 wounded and
almost 18 billion dollars in costs. The
seizure of Tibet was a simple piece of
imperialism.
Communist defeat in Malaya after
twelve years of battle and similar defeat
in the Philippines will now be followed,
in my opinion, by a stalemate in the
Indo-China peninsula. For one thing is
clear from the history of “wars of libera-
tion” since the Second World War the
victim must be weak, like Tibet, or else
without allies, or both, as Kuomintang
China was. Given a modern industrial
power capable of and willing to fight as
an ally, “wars of liberation” become
dangerous for aggressor Communist
countries, whose economies cannot sup-
port, except at enormous cost to their
planning programmes, protracted conflict.
The third requirement for Communist
success is speed. That is why Fidel Castro
won so easily in Cuba. The Batista gov-
ernment was corroded, unsupported and
friendless. Fidel Castro looked good, the
Herbert L. Matthews propaganda camou-
flaged the Communist character of the
revolution and they made it. But the “war
of liberation” in Venezuela will not
succeed, despite the FALN terror, so long
as Havana knows that US troops are
poised to fly in at the first sign that the
Caracas Government is unable to cope.
What President Johnson is doing in South
Vietnam and what he did in the
Dominican Republic—is not lost on
Fidel Castro, I am sure.
In other words, despite a feeling on a
previous visit that the way to lose to the
Communists is by using conventional war
tactics, I am beginning to be persuaded
that conventional war with ordnance,
manpower, airpower, either fluid or
fixed battlefronts, accompanied by some
counter-insurgency manoeuvres, is the
only way to outflank them.
Put another way, American strategy
now in Vietnam is to force and entice
the Vietcong 65,000 hard-core “Chu
Luc”, plus about 100,000 irregulars, plus
about 40,000 North Vietnamese infiltrees
—to come out of their foxholes and
thus transform their ambush tactics, their
hit and run tactics, their terror and
effective propaganda and their brain-
washing in short, the entire arsenal of
“liberation” weapons into face-to-face,
bayonet-to-bayonet battle.
The US is now doing what it can do

best war, direct combat and to hell
with psychological war, political war and
all the special training programmes at
Fort Bragg, Oberammergau, Eglin Field,
Okinawa, for counter-insurgency. With a
skilful political enemy like Mao or Ho,
there is nothing else to be done hut to
provide muscle, in every shape or form,
except nuclear.
Such a response would not work if
America were determined on “rollback”.
I am sure that had President Eisenhower
insisted on going beyond the 38th
Parallel, the US might still be fighting in
Korea or else have used the atomic bomb
once more. And since the Johnson Ad-
ministration had stated again and again
that they “seek no wider war”, that they
do not intend the overthrow of the
Hanoi regime, they offer the Communists
difficult choices. To beat the American
forces, now that they are arriving daily
with every conceivable kind of weapon
plus, of course, the ineffable Seventh
Fleet Communist guerrilla tactics are
insufficient. American power must be
met by Communist power and that
means grave risk for Hanoi. It hasn't that
kind of power against an industrial giant
immune from attack at home and it is
questionable whether Hanoi would want
a million Chinese troops marching
through North Vietnam.
Verge of victory
\JVvlkt impels me to this analysis is that
the Communists twice in the last 21
months looked as if they would take
power in South Vietnam at any moment.
The first occasion was the immediate
aftermath of the Diem regime overthrow
in November, 1963, and the second time
was in October-November, 1964, when
the Communists were American
officials admit this now —on the verge
of victory. Somehow they didn’t make it,
because when it came to phase three
fighting in divisional strength and being
able to muster the essential logistics for
fixed warfare —it could not be done
against the US. It could have been done
easily had the South Vietnamese been
alone, but they were not.
This is what I meant when I suggested,
earlier we were at a turning-point in
history, because it appears that “wars of
liberation” are doomed as a tactic if the
victim has an ally or allies with patience
power and prowess. The victim may be i
corrupt government —Khrushchev in hi
January, 1963, speech called them “rot
ten, reactionary regimes” or a piece of
real estate with no sense of nationhood
or without an economy. But if the victim
has a friend willing to make the victim's
interest his own, “wars of liberation” will
not work. (Stalin tried a “war of libern
tion” in Greece and Turkey, which failed


because of President Truman. However
shaken and riven both countries may be
today, they exist.)
Having said all this, I must add that
when America has to bring up so much
of its weaponry and manpower it is
dangerously late. There' can be no victory
in South Vietnam = —meaning a stable
government without the intrusion of
Communist coalitionism without an
American occupation army for years to
come to ensure the country’s continued
existence. Now would be the time for
American policy planners to determine
who are the potential victims Iran?
of “wars of liberation” and see if they
can avoid the inevitable heavy losses of
American lives in these wars, let alone
among the people who live in these
Communist target areas.
The theory of “wars of liberation”
depended from the outset upon Western
unwillingness to risk war with either or
both of the Communist powers. Since
the Sino-Soviet alliance is ruptured for
some years to come and since the Soviet
Union itself “seeks no wider war” over
South Vietnam, the burden of protector
has fallen upon China. America has
exercised its option counter-invasion
along conventional lines. China today has
only one option counter counter-inva-
sion— if they mean to safeguard the
ten-year-old investment of South Viet-
nam. This option they will not or they
cannot exercise, because it means a con-
frontation with American military power
for which China is obviously unprepared.
If luck holds out, we may see the
cremation of the “wars of liberation”
doctrine in South Vietnam, just as we
saw the end of the Soviet military threat
to Western Europe after the Berlin airlift
and the creation of NATO.
Joining
the Club
Qualified neutrality
From GAVIN YOUNG
in Singapore
The vehemence of the tirade of
Singapore’s Prime Minister, Lee
Kuan Yew, against what he sees
as the United States’ lack of judgment
and understanding of South-East Asia
has surprised many observers here. But
it was the manner in which he expressed
his vow not to have the Americans in
Singapore whatever happens, not the vow
itself, that was surprising.
Three weeks after Singapore’s sudden
exit from the Malaysian Lederation two
questions are foremost in Mr Lee’s mind:
Acceptance of Singapore as a worthy
member of their club by the Afro-Asian
States, and entry into the United Nations,
and the security of the island from
aggression and subversion. In the Afro-
Asian context, Mr Lee’s concern is to
convince the world that, despite the
great British military base on the eastern
tip of Singapore, and his close ties with
Britain and Malaysia, he is not a neo-
colonialist stooge. His tough talk last
week was designed to make it clear
beyond doubt that he has no intention
of attaching Singapore to either of the
two major power blocs —US or Chinese.
As Mr Lee is well known as an out-
spoken anti-Communist the extreme
Left wing and the Communists in Singa-
pore are his bitter -foes there is no
question of his throwing his hand in
with Peking. To reassure non-aligned
Afro-Asians, he had, therefore, to make
it clear that he had no desire to go to
the other extreme and embrace the
Americans. He did this, typically, in no
uncertain terms. The fact that his state-
ment included a rambling and scathing
attack on the US character can be put
down to a genuine belief that Americans
lack understanding of Asia’s problems
and his own turbulent character, which
tends to boil over in front of a television
camera, as on this occasion to the em-
barrassment of his more cautious col-
leagues.
Mr Lee’s preoccupation up to now
with domestic politics—first in winning
the Premiership and outwitting the
island’s numerous Left-wing extremists,
and secondly in unsuccessfully striving to
achieve a working relationship with his
Malayan neighbors in the Malaysian
experiment—has left him somewhat short
on international experience and tact. He
certainly lacks faith in American judg-
ment, but he could have made his point
with less anti-American acrimony. Still,
for Singapore the point he wanted to
make to Afro-Asians was a reasonable
one. It is that if the British, Australians
and New Zealanders abandon their
defence responsibilities in this area of
South-East Asia there can be no question
of inviting the Americans to replace
them in the base.
Not only was this a reassurance to
the non-aligned world, it was also a
warning to the British that if they decide
to pull out they will simply leave Singa-
pore wide open to any Communist
aggression, military or subversive. Mr
Lee said he saw danger of a British
withdrawal as British public opinion
over Britain’s defence role “East of
Suez” becomes increasingly disillusioned
by events there. It may also be that
Mr Lee, who does few things without
careful calculation, wished to warn the
Americans that if they fear that Britain
is “disengagement-minded” in South-East
Asia, and have plans to move in to re-
place the British, they had better think
again.
On a recent visit to Borneo I heard
that at least one US official had been
discussing this possibility with local
politicians, pointedly emphasising that
Britain had not sent troops to support
the United States in Vietnam, as they
might have been expected to. One
Borneo politician complained to me
about this, and I understand that British
officials there have been irked by similar
reports, which could well have reached
Mr Lee’s ears.
Be that as it may, the Singapore base
is something of a dilemma for the Singa-
pore Government. As Mr Lee sees it,
the British presence is both vital for
Singapore and an embarrassment. Singa-
pore has no armed forces to speak of,
and faces the threat of invasion from
Indonesia and subversion by Communists
at home. The base is the linch-pin of
the British defence system guarding
Malaysia (also militarily weak) and
Singapore, and Mr Lee has made it plain
that as far as he is concerned there is
no option but to allow it to remain.
Lrom what Mr Lee has said in the
past it seems, too, that he may be mulling
thoughts of Singapore as some sort of
“third Chinese force” in Asia, sup-
ported by a Britain which accepts the
moral obligation to protect its Asian
friends but adopts a role more indepen-
dent of America, perhaps more closely
approaching the kind of role President
de Gaulle has visualised for Prance.
Mr Lee is an impressive, dynamic
politician—some would say one of Asia’s
genuine leaders of stature, despite his
tiny island nation. He is a democratic
socialist, he is young, he has ambition.
His angry tirade this week could have
been a step to disengage himself from
the second of the two great power blocs
with a long-term view of an eventual part
to play as mediator i» Asia.


THE WEEK
OVERSEAS
INDIA-PAKISTAN
Kashmir as China's Chance?
As grey thunderclouds drenched New
Delhi with a monsoon downpour
last week, an air-raid siren atop the
Government-run Ashoka Hotel began a
mournful wail across the city’s dripping
rooftops. Hotel officials explained they
were “just testing” the siren “in case of
emergency”, but the wait symbolised the
new crisis between India and its neighbor
Pakistan.
Never, in the 18 years of their on-
again-off-again scrapping, have India and
Pakistan been closer to war. With tanks
battling on the dun-colored frontier
plains and jets clashing overhead, both
countries seemed to be throwing off all
restraints in a rapidly developing dispute
over Kashmir. The crisis raised the
possibility that South-East Asia’s two
biggest non-Communist countries might
lock in a full-scale war at a time when
file power of Communist China loomed
over the whole area. Such a develop-
ment could not only shake the whole of
Asia already unsettled because of
Vietnam but could upset the world’s
power balance. The crisis caught the
United States in the middle. Each side
accused the other of using arms which
Washington supplied originally for pro-
tection against Commuffist China. At
the end of the week diplomatic efforts
were pressed in Washington, London,
Ottawa, the United Nations and else-
where in hopes of heading off fighting
before it got out of control,
Kashmir is the biggest bone of con-
tention in the uneasy relationship exist-
ing between India and Pakistan ever
since 1947, when the Indian sub-con-
tinent was partitioned as British rule
ended. Pakistan was founded as a
Moslem counterpart to the bigger Hindu
State, fathered by Gandhi and Nehru.
From the start, when religious conflicts
rocked the sub-continent, there have
been differences over influence in South-
East Asia and rivalry for economic aid
from both Western and Communist
worlds. Many Pakistanis have harbored
the f ear that Indian irredentists were
waiting for the right moment to re-
absorb what they regarded as their “lost
territory .
Last week fighting grew to crisis pro-
portions and brought the two nations to
the brink of all-out war. India captured
more Pakistani positions in what was
described as the biggest battle of post-
independence years. Pakistan retaliated
by seizing some Indian posts. By mid-
week tanks and planes were thrown into
battle. Some of the heaviest fighting took
place near Chamb, where the Kashmir
cease-fire line meets the international
border between India and Pakistan,
India protested to Washington, claim-
ing Pakistan was using American-supplied
"W ould you please do up my shoelace, Professor?"
F-86 Sabre jets and Patton tanks in
violation of mutual agreements. Govern-
ment spokesmen said Pakistan would
never have dared to launch its attack at
Chamb without the American planes and
tanks.
In Pakistan, however, there was the
widely held view that open fighting
would not have erupted in Kashmir if
the US had not given military aid to
India in the three years since the Indian-
Chinese border clashes.
While India’s army is said to be aching
for a chance to prove itself after a
bloody-nose on the Chinese border in
1962 and in Rann of Kutch, there are
strong economic reasons for India not to
go on a war footing. India’s economy
is badly lagging and foreign exchange
shortage is acute. The country would
have to shelve its development pro-
gramme if mobilised. The presence of
50 million Moslems in India is also an
inhibiting factor. War between India
and Pakistan would almost mean a
renewal of bitter communal fighting
which marked early post-independence
years. Some communal clashes have
already occurred in the city of Poona.
As for Pakistan, Ayub’s Government
may feel that now is the time to take
on India. If Pakistanis ever had any
hope of getting Indian Kashmir through
a plebiscite or negotiations, that hope has
been scotched by India’s firm declara-
tions against such a settlement. On the
other hand, though Pakistan’s army is
well-trained and well-equipped, it would
probably have little chance in a pro-
longed struggle against India’s much
larger forces —at least without outside
help.
In the view of American experts the
deterioration of Indian-Pakistani relations
weakens drastically the defence of the

UNITED STATES
Integration
FFhe American Negro is passing another
milestone in his quest for equality.
As more schools reopened last week,
the South was experiencing the largest
wave of school desegregation in its his-
tory. Thousands of Negro children were
entering classrooms formerly reserved for
whites. No major violence was reported.
Although precise figures were hard to
come by, it was estimated that integra-
tion in the South will be more than
double that of the previous 11 years
since the Supreme Court declared separa-
tion by race in schools unconstitutional.
As Civil Rights groups have pointed
out, however, this integration amounts
only to a token. In most areas the
milestone is not in numbers but in two
developments that may have significant
meaning for the future: (1) Integration
was achieved for the first time in wide
areas of the Deep South, notably in
small cities and rural areas where there
are heavy concentrations of Negroes and
where white opposition has been great-
est; (2) the essence of the 1954 Supreme
Court decision has been, or soon will
be, achieved in nearly every school dis-
trict in the country. That is, de jure
segregation or segregation which is
accomplished by policy or overt action
of local or State authorities is virtually
eliminated.
GREECE
The King's Men
p\>R more than seven weeks Greece’s
tough King Constantine and shrewd-
est old politician Papandreou have
manoeuvred to thwart each other’s will.
Both have succeeded in leaving the
country without a real government. Last
week the battle continued without a
final solution in sight. Both have
employed with considerable skill the
powers given them under the Constitu-
tion. Papandreou’s aim is to become
head of the government again and Con-
stantine’s aim is to prevent this. Papan-
dreou, head of the Centre Union Party
which is the largest bloc in Parliament,
has frustrated three attempts by Con-
stantine to install a new Premier. But
neither seems to be able to win against
the other.
At the weekend, in a move clearly
designed to embarrass the leader of the
major Conservative Party, Panayotis
Canellopoulos, and bring new pressure
on the King, Papandreou accepted a
proposal by Canellopoulos to hold elec-
tions within 45 days under a Cabinet
formed by the Conservatives.
Papandreou’s acceptance caused con-
sternation in Canellopoulos’s party which
had criticised its leader for making the
proposal the previous day. If the two
party leaders stand by their positions,
the King will find himself in the difficult
position of opposing a joint bid for
elections by the chiefs of the two great
parties of Greece.

6,000 cheering fans
started the season with steel
(At St. Kilda’s new football ground the trend is to steel 22,925 square feet of it!)
And when the fans stand up to cheer the winning
kick, they won’t spare a thought for all that steel.
But one thing is certain—steel will keep them full of
cheer—hail, rain or shine. Year after year. This new
6,000 capacity grandstand at Moorabbin (Mel-
bourne’s first new league ground, and built for St.
Kilda club) features 22,925 square feet of steel sheet.
To be exact: 18,950 square feet of Klip-Lok roofing
with spans up to 58 feet; and 3,975 square feet of
Tri-Lok walling. So look around. The trend is to
steel. For homes. For commercial buildings. Indus-
trial projects. And football grounds, too. Steel,
because of its great structural strength. Steel, because
it looks good in its natural state. Steel, because in
the long run it costs less. Lysaght roofing and walling
comes in six attractive profiles. Klip-Lok, Spandek,
Trimdek, Custom V-Crimp, Custom Orb and Tri-

Albert Monk’s
New Chance
Anti-Communist revulsion butters no bread
Within the space of two months, Sydney will have provided the locale of the
two most important Labor conferences in years. The Federal Conference of the
ALP met in the Hellenic Hall from August 2 to 6. The Biennial Congress of the
ACTU will meet from September 13 to 17. But whereas the ALP Conference was
small numerically, comprising only the notorious thirty-six, the ACTU Congress will
credential approximately 550 delegates, representing approximately 100 affiliated
unions.
The real ACTU decisions will have
been made beforehand, probably during
the meeting of the Interstate Executive
which was held in Melbourne from Aug-
ust 30 to September 3.
The substance of the political situa-
tion within the ACTU lies in a series of
Communist excesses and abuses of pow-
er since the last ACTU Congress in 1963;
and in the reaction of the non-Com-
munist elements to a campaign of shop
committee disruption which, nominally
launched against the employers, is in
fact designed to smash the non-Com-
munist leadership of the ACTU.
The long series of stoppages in de-
fence establishments throughout 1964
was a tribute to Communist power to
manipulate its own creation the shop
committee movement. The anarchic
GMH stoppage led ACTU Vice-Presi-
dent Kenny to say: “The trade union
movement of the country would be dis-
gusted if I was able to tell the full story.”
The almost incredible Mt Isa stoppage
could not have lasted if the Communist
Party had not marshalled all of its own
forces and those of its associates
throughout the country. The leaders of
powerful but moderate unions like the
Ironworkers’ and the Australian Society
of Engineers were left under no illusion
as to the motivations behind the stop-
pages at the Lithgow Small Arms Fac-
tory, home of the FN rifle. Last year’s
stoppages at Williamstown and Garden
Island naval dockyards were aimed at
essential defence industry and were
manipulated by the Communists through
local unions and shop committees. Fin-
ally there has been the long series of
waterfront stoppages which were under-
taken without reference to the ACTU.
The significance of these events has
not escaped the non-Communist union
leaders who still have a clear, if not
substantial, majority within the trade
unions but only if they care to mo-
bilise it. The result is that for the first
time since the Labor split in 1955 a de-
cided anti-Communist revulsion is the
prevailing mood of trade union official-
dom.
But sentiment, unless organised, but-
ters no bread. It is here that the decisive
role of the ACTU leadership emerges.
At every ACTU Congress since 1955
there have been few points of difference
between the ACTU officials and the well-
organised Communist forces. The ma-
jority of ACTU leaders have lent them-
selves willingly to the favorite Com-
munist policy of isolating the Industrial
Group force. But there have always
been one or two issues on which Mr Al-
bert Monk and the Communists have in
fact divided. These issues have facilitat-
ed the identification of the actual vot-
ing strength on which the Communist
faction could rely. “Could rely” is the
salient phrase. The Communists can rely
on many delegates other than actual CP
members. In 1959 it was approximately
180 votes out of 470. In 1961 it was 180
votes out of 413. (This was the Congress
from which a number of anti-Communist
unions were excluded because they re-
fused to pay the “China levy”.) In 1963
it was 190 votes out of 509. This year
it is 210 out of 550.
JTlhese issues not only enabled observ-
A ers to estimate the size of the force
on which the Communists could inde-
pendently rely even against the “middle
of the road” elements. They also proved
conclusively that Mr Monk and his main
officials had it in their power to defeat
and isolate the Communists at every
Congress had they wished to do so. It
will be the same in the coming Con-
gress.
When one looks at the composition of
the Interstate Executive, it becomes quite
clear that the character of the decisions
will be determined by the officers
Messrs Monk, Kenny, Evans and Souter.
The Communists have three members
on the Executive Messrs McDonald,
Dawson and Wright. They obtain the
unswerving support of “Mick” O’Brien,
and can quite often rely on the WA
representative, Coleman. Among the
other members, Messrs Riordan, Jordan,
Johns, Harradine, Marsh are seized with
the necessity of grasping the nettle.
ACTU Secretary Souter, likewise, has
every reason to call for a showdown.
Thus, a lead from the other officers
would be assured of support from these
members. In addition, Albert Monk can
usually command the support of Messrs
Wilson and Petrie. Hence the outcome
of the Congress will be determined in
large measure by the attitude that Messrs
Monk, Evans and Kenny adopt at the
Executive meeting. And the trend of the
trade union movement for many years
will be determined by this Congress.
The issues which will be debated will
set the tone of the Congress: the only
decision which matters will, however, be
made when the Congress elects the six
members of the Interstate Executive
one representing each of the six industry
groups into which the Congress is divid-
ed.
As to the issues, the Communists have
made no secret as to the type of policy
decision they want from the Congress.
In the March, 1965, issue of the “Com-
munist Review”, Mr T. Wright, Federal
Secretary of the Sheet Metal Workers’
Union, member of the Central Commit-
tee of the Communist Party and member
of the ACTU Interstate Executive, de-
clared that a main Communist aim was
to increase Communist influence (and
reduce that of the Interstate Executive)
by giving the six industry groups in the
ACTU a “definite field of jurisdiction
with power to make decisions, and also
with certain executive power”.
In the same article he outlined other
Communist objectives. They included:
(1) The promotion of reciprocal visits
between the ACTU and the “trade
unions” of Communist countries.
(2) The immediate recall of all Aus-
tralian forces, and also the withdrawal


of all British and American forces in
South-East Asia. y
(3) A demand that the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions have
discussions with, and seek points of
agreement with, the Communist-front
organisation, the World Federation of
Trade Unions.
(4) The promotion of activities of the
Congress for International Co-operation
and Disarmament.
If the Communists are clear on what
they wish to achieve, the non-Communist
union leaders ought to be equally clear.
The most important function of the Con-
gress is the choice of the half-dozen
members of the Interstate Executive,
which the Congress selects. If the Com-
munists and their collaborators can be
reduced in influence on the Interstate
Executive, there is a chance that for the
next two years the ACTU can concen-
trate on its essential role of the repre-
sentative of the economic interests of
unionists.
The Communist position is numeri-
cally stronger than in 1959. Out of ap-
proximately 550 delegates who will be
credentialled, the Communists will be
able to rely on a vote of about 210. This
is 30/40 more than they have been able
to rely on in the past. It is due basically
to the affiliation of the NSW Public Ser-
vice Union (a majority of whose dele-
gates can be relied on to vote with the
extreme Left), the deterioration in the
position in the Postal Workers’ Union
and the Transport Workers’ Union.
It is rumored that the Communists
propose to use their numbers to replace
their long-time supporter M. O’Brien by
C. Fitzgibbon of the WWF, and the ail-
ing Communist “Gerry” Dawson of
Queensland with the younger and more
vigorous P. Clancy of Sydney.
When all the votes are taken into con-
sideration, there is still a narrow non-
Communist majority. The only question
is whether Messrs Monk, Kenny and
Evans will decide to use it.
Organising Grub St
Authors disciplining publishers
By M. H. ELLIS
Since I wrote in “The Bulletin” more than two years ago on the need for an ef-
fective Society of Authors in Australia, on the lines of the British one, such a society
actually has got well into its stride. Although an Australian Writers’ Society existed
in London, as far back as 1952, dedicated to acting as “spokesman and advice and
information centre for Australian writers in the United Kingdom”, at home Australian
writers had lagged behind. For another decade Australian authors had no body, or even
an agency system, to protect them and do business for them. Now they have.
The new habit of Australian writers,
who have a world market, living at
home has been a boon to the Australian
author community. Morris West, Olaf
Ruhen and others, for instance, have
done a great deal to set the new Aus-
tralian Society of Authors on practical
courses and to begin to professionalise
what hitherto was a part-time occupation,
save in a few instances, for amateurs,
journalists and professional men bent on
supplementing normal incomes or mak-
ing bids for fame.
The society has made considerable
strides under the presidency first of
Dal Stivens and then of Morris West,
both men with wide overseas experience.
It set as its membership qualifications
a basic requirement that a prospective
member must have had a book pub-
lished within the last seven years, or that
he should have had three major stories
or other works published in major
journals or newspapers, or a play or
radio script presented on radio or TV
within 18 months before lodging his
application; otherwise that he satisfies
the committee that he was a professional.
Persons with literary work in progress,
but not yet published, may be admitted
at the discretion of the society as
associate members. A paid secretary,
Miss Jill Hellyer, was appointed and a
membership of 350 has been built up.
The committee has found an almost
virgin field awaiting cultivation. It
found Australian books still outside the
protection of the Universal Copyright
Convention, it faced the problem of
uniform contracts with publishers, of
minimum fees and royalties, of plagiarism
over the radio, of the habit of anthologists
of appropriating large slabs from the
works of authors without adequate—or
any—fee.
In Australia, the contract between
author and publisher is a recent mani-
festation, the formulation of which
usually has lain entirely with the pub-
lisher. He, for the most part, has not
been backward in protecting himself
financially and otherwise. One such
optimist once sent me four closely
printed pages of foolscap to cover an
agreement to write a few thousand
words. This document appeared to give
me a £25 advance against the proceeds
of a 10 per cent royalty on a ss.
pamphlet in return for rights to the
publisher of everything literary, past,
present and future, that I owned or
might own, except the title deeds to my
immortal soul. Reputable publishers are
not relucant to see the position tidied
up and a standard contract introduced.
They are, no doubt, less enthusiastic
about the society’s pressures for in-
creased royalties. These normally have
been anything up to a basic 10 per cent
of retail sales proceeds with the first
flight of publishers, with increases of
2 i per cent for each new 5000 copies
sold. With mounting costs of material
and printing labor, the tendency of pub-
lishers has been either to undercut the
original 10 per cent or to ask that the
author waive progressive increases.
Authors serving overseas markets with
fiction, and with huge fields of sale, can
expect opulent contracts which may give
them a minimum royalty of 25 per cent
and assurances of Book Society sales of
some sort that, may run as high as
50,000 in one lump. But it is possible
to see the side of the Australian pub-
lisher whose sales, even at the most
expansive, do not touch the fringe of
magnitude enjoyed by the overseas pub-
lisher of popular works. Most Aus-
tralian books are non-fiction which, even
if they run to the limit, are a headache
on the financial side. This more especially
as, with experience, the publishers have
fallen into the wary habit of looking on
a first edition as the potential last, and
disposing of its type so that new editions
have to be reset or lithographed.
Their argument against rising per-
centage royalties under these circum-
stances has some ground under it on the
basis that the author’s royalties rise
merely through increase in printing and
selling costs. But so does the author’s
cost of living.
One of my own books, published in
1947, for instance, cost to my knowledge
£1 a copy to print and sold profitably at
£2 2s. By the time it came out in a new
edition three years afterwards it sold for
£2 10s. A recent new edition put the
price up to £4 4s. On a 10 per cent basic
royalty my return would go up from
4s. 2d. per copy to Bs. sd. a copy. Since
that book cost me several years of work
it is scarcely a payable proposition. For
the same amount of day-to-day journal-
istic writing I could earn at least ten
times as much.
The Authors’ Society is tackling the
matter naturally from its own point
of view and, perhaps, on too uniform a
basis. A demand for a 10 per cent basic
royalty with 25 per cent advance on
10,000 copies which has been mooted is
enough to give publishers heart failure.
Eventually, a reasonable scale and
system will be devised, but it will have
to be on a workable economic basis.


Whatever it is, it will certainly improve
and stabilise the conditions under which
authors work and give them considerably
more protection and rights than they
have. It will also, surely, tend to
restrict the profession of book and
magazine writing because it will dis-
courage publishers in their present policy
of issuing large numbers of books in
small editions on the basis that they
can print them, sell them and forget
them after a first printing of a thousand
or so. Better quality, fewer books and
bigger circulations are something for
the serious professional author com-
munity to aim at.
Much of what the Authors’ Society
appears to be trying to do in detail is
really the work of an author’s agent. It
is astonishing that in the Australian field
there is no such animal. Anybody who
has employed a reputable one soon learns
that his commission pays for itself. In
view of the existence of a vast field of
opportunities and legal rights to re-
muneration on the side from broadcast-
ing, TV, syndicate publication, antholo-
gies and so forth, the job of selling an
author’s work has become a separate
profession.
In such matters as broadcasting rights,
the society can establish a basis, but it
cannot, obviously, discriminate between
authors and negotiate individual agree-
ments. Indeed, for some of its members
its agreements could well prove a
hindrance to upgrading their rates in
accord with wide selling capacity. At
the same time, it has done good work.
That national institution, the Aus-
tralian Broadcasting Commission, has
been brought up to scratch with its rates
of remuneration. Only a year or two
ago, for example, there was constant
complaint from authors about the rates
paid for school broadcast material
for a 1500-word short story previously
published and by an established author,
£2 25., and for 1800 words £2 16s.
Comparative BBC rates were £l3 13s.
and £l5 15s. The Authors’ Society has
altered this condition of affairs by
agreement with the ABC and produced a
new standard of payment which, some
of its committee members claim, is in
general scale superior in rates to those
paid by the BBC.
The Authors’ Society appears to have
come to stay and from now onward
must be an influence in the publishing
world in dealing with copyright, general
rights and remuneration, and the ethics
of authorship. Its membership list seems
to include nearly all the leading writers
of the continent and, provided it is
patient while firm and keeps its opera-
tions within the bounds of practicality, it
will undoubtedly work a revolution in
the Commonwealth’s Grub Street.
Letters to the Editor
Singapore's Separation
SIR. —Dr Peter Boyce's article (8., August
21) asks why the Australian and British Gov-
ernments were not consulted, or even in-
formed. by the Malaysian Prime Minister
before the separation of Singapore was
accomplished. I think the reason why this
was not done was because the Tunku felt
master in his own house, perhaps felt also
that this had to be made clear, to his own
party in particular, and that defence pacts
or not, this was a piece of domestic house
cleaning. To have discussed this with an
unsympathetic Lord Heath would have
achieved nothing. It has also been asked
why, if Lee Kuan Yew was so dedicated to
the concept of Malaysia, he did not inform
Australia and Britain before the split; and
thus use their pressure to avert the crisis.
If Britain and Australia had been approached,
and had either successfully averted the
secession or had failed in their attempts, the
result in any case would have been to
brand Singapore's Prime Minister as a neo-
colonialist, and Malaysia as something kept
together merely by Western imperialists.
Britain and Australia just had to be kept
out, if this image was not to be created.
A further point, one that has been over-
looked in the crisis, is the internal split
over this in the Alliance, the governing party.
Although all of Singapore's Ministers signed
the sad separation agreement, only three
Malay Ministers, all English educated, signed.
These were the Prime Minister, the Deputy,
Tun Abdul Razak, and one other, Dato Ismail;
together with the Minister of Finance (Tan
Siew Sin) and the Indian Minister. Con-
spicuous amongst the Malay Ministers who
did not sign was the powerful Minister for
Education, Mohamed Khir Johari. He obviously
has support from those that would have
taken other steps rather than split Singapore
from the mainland, and who disapproved of
it. The outcome of this divided opinion
remains obscure, and warrants Australia's
close attention.
This Malaysia crisis has been (and re-
mains) but one of many recent developments
in South-East Asia that has been of im-
mediate significance to Australia. Australia's
future increasingly is tied up with Asia. It
is almost incomprehensible then that you,
the leading weekly in Australia, have no
Australian representative permanently in this
region.

Law V. Reform
SIR. Whilst one can always hope, I see
little prospect of the Third Commonwealth
Empire Law Conference initiating much of
practical importance to the citizen for the
following reasons:
(1) Judges have never been nearer to a
lay client than as a barrister, and the
academics have not even been that close.
The arguing or determining of cases within
a strictly formalised structure and to a large
extent relayed through solicitors' clerks leaves
plenty of scope for eighteenth-century oratory
and tactics but little for full or cheap justice.
(2) In these days of advertising, solicitors
cannot; and, by the outmoded and cumber-
some controls over most of their costs, are
forced to waste their training cultivating
contacts in building societies, real estate
agents and the like—instead of clients. Any
clerk does the conveyancing once the
financial tie-up is arranged or perhaps a
solicitor is employed on a production line
basis (which is not the basis in other pro-
fessions). Those solicitors who are well
established have their directorships but
where does that leave the little fellow?
(3) The concept of absolute liability with
insurance in motor vehicle accidents has not
been seriously disputed ever since a senior
judge took the wrong turning in the last
century; yet we still do not have it.
(4) The arbitrary division of the profession
into barrister and solicitor (backed up by
the costs structure) has been as long over-
due for change; because there is no challeng-
ing that the more removes you put between
the lay client and his remedy the less justice
he gets and the more it costs.
(5) The present-day legal structure is as
outmoded as Adam Smith's economic theories
and has, of course, largely been by-passed
by the citizen who is wise to have nothing
to do with writs of certiorari, mandamus and
prohibition.
The only worthwhile reforms must come
from the grass-roots and I suggest a rep-
resentative body on which the only lawyers
would be master solicitors of between five
and ten years' experience. Over that, they
will be fundamentally as opposed to change
as the present Law Conference. The Law
Society, of course (like most other organisa-
tions), speaks for those who have the leisure
time to run for its offices.

Soviet Capitalism
SIR. The article by G. Segal (8., August
28) refers to a recent contribution in the
Soviet journal "Economic Gazette" which
drew attention to the fact that the priority
development of heavy industry over light
industry is not a rigid economic "law" for-
ever binding on socialist economics. Segal
says that the appearance of this article
occurs "quite extraordinarily". He also draws
the further conclusion that such a viewpoint
concedes that the entire industrialisation
policy pursued in the USSR was unnecessary
and unjustified. What is actually "extra-
ordinary" is that a specialist on Communist
affairs could regard the Soviet authors' state-
ment as new or unusual, and that he could
display such obvious ignorance of the im-
plications of modern technology in dictating
the rate and structure of industrialisation
programmes.
In the first place, the views presented in
"Economic Gazette" are far from new. They
were advanced in the USSR by Feldman and
by Kovalevsky in the Soviet journal "Planned
Economy" in December, 1930. Both of these
authors showed that the rate of increase of
future consumption depended on the current
allocation of funds to heavy industry and
the industries producing capital equipment,
and that the necessary diversion of funds to

these sectors would become smaller once
the industrial base of the economy became
established. In the absence of extensive inter-
national trade (denied in the 1930 s to the
USSR by the international political situation),
consumption goods could not be produced
without prior investment in machines and
tools to turn out such "wage-goods”.
In more recent times, the idea that con-
sumer-goods industries can grow at the
same or higher rates than capital goods
industries was argued 10 years ago by
A. I. Nothin in the Soviet journal "Questions
of Economics" and by M. Kalecki and
Bronislaw Mine in the Polish journal "Ekono-
mista". May, 1956. The notion that the
priority development of heavy industry in
pre-war Russia was unnecessary could only
be true if one assumed that consumption
goods can be made without investment in
the machines that make machines that make
such consumer goods; that there is a short
period of gestation in construction and equip-
ment industries; that equipment has a uniform
life spread. All of these are unrealistic
when one looks at the nature of modern
technology.
All that is happening today is that the
Soviet economy has reached the level of
maturity at which Feldman and Kovalevsky
thought a rapid and more than proportional
growth of the consumer goods section would
be feasible.

Mr Adermann's Trick
SIR. I can only say the writer of "Mr
Adermann's Trick" (Plain English, 8., August
28) must certainly be a very biased "reten-
tion" man. A one-grower-one-vote system is
the fairest way, otherwise we are harking
back to the feudal system of the Middle Ages.
Is it just to give a grazier, whose income
(although he may produce 100 bales) is only
partly derived from wool, more votes than
the "little" man whose whole income is wool,
yet only produces 15 bales. It is a well
known fact that many of the "grazing elite",
commonly referred to as the backbone of the
industry, hold considerable interests in textile
manufacturing companies. wonder,
indeed, that they fight the reserve price plan
so vigorously.

Miles Davis
SIR. —Mr Pickering's review of the recent
Miles Davis CBS album "My Funny Valen-
tine" (B„ August 28) can scarcely pass with-
out some further comment. He is, of course,
perfectly entitled to his opinion of Miles
Davis. But to say that his sound is "con-
sistently unpleasing to my old Armstrong-
trained ears" hardly satisfies the basic
standards required of a reviewer. What one
reasonably expects in a review is a com-
parative evaluation of the music on the
record written by a reviewer with some under-
standing and knowledge of the musician's
work. Mr Pickering's comments range from
the offensive to the meaningless. The sugges-
tion that Miles Davis' "sound is expressive
only of despair and hate" is beyond reason-
able discussion. He may also care to explain
in greater detail just what he means by
"gloom-ridden, anti-melodic moanings" and
"toneless mutterings".

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Look at the Head Office,
Not the Box Office
Missing out on the opera boom
By JOHN CARGHER
Much has been written about the
doldrums in which the Australian
theatre is floundering right now.
However, with one exception, near paral-
lels can be drawn with London and
Broadway. That exception is grand
opera.
Throughout the rest of the world
there is a boom in opera which shows
no signs of abating. Millions are being
poured into subsidies, not to keep alive
a dead art, but to ensure that the over-
whelming demand for a very live
medium is met. Yet, in spite of the
current Sutherland-Williamson opera
season, which really cannot be faulted
seriously by its worst critics, opera in
Australia is right now at its lowest ebb.
Any hope that Joan Sutherland might
have revived interest in the medium as
such appears to have been shattered.
To discover why Australia is the odd
man out in this field one must look
closely not only at recent operatic
ventures, but at past. Once upon a time,
even before Melba brought her own
glamo back to this country, opera was
“the big event” here, just as it was in
the United States. While the Metro-
politan grew from infancy to adulthood,
Australia’s intermittent odd seasons also
grew in excellence and thereby improved
the operatic status pro rata. By the-
-1920s J. C. Williamson’s had a strangle-
hold on the medium and held tight on to
it while it continued to be a financial
bonanza. Unfortunately the management
grew flaccid during the post-war boom
when literally anything filled a theatre
and, as costs grew, financial considera-
tions and personal friendships began to
govern the choice of personnel and
repertoire. As a result standards dropped
with each season, culminating in the
fiasco of 1955 which apparently
knocked the Firm out of the operatic
field for good. The present season is
clearly an exception in which William-
son's are trying to cash in on a sure-fire
box office star; for the artistic merits
of the season we must thank the
Bonynges.
That leaves, of course, the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust, the unfortunate victim of
all critical assaults. While I have the
greatest admiration for the work the
Trust has been doing and while actively
being one of the Trust’s loudest unpaid
propagandists, I cannot but lay the blame
for many of opera’s present troubles
squarely at its feet. It was within the
Trust’s power to reverse the unfavorable
trend created by the last of Williamson’s
“International Grand Opera Seasons”.
To be blunt, it has failed to do so. Why
it has failed, and how it can now eradi-
cate the additional rot it has allowed to
accumulate, is a double-barrelled ques-"
tion with many answers. To find them,
we must enquire into the reasons which
have caused audiences here to dwindle
at a time when they have been doubling
and trebling overseas. Here are the
causes I see, others may make additions
as they will.
1. Loyal opera fans have ceased attend-
ing to a large extent because time
and again they have spent hard-
earned money on productions of in-
ferior quality which had been pub-
licised by managements and critics
as from good to magnificent.
2. There has been no attempt at all to
recruit new audiences to opera by
presenting regular productions of
universally popular appeal.
3. A poor box-office image has been
created by the constant stressing of
opera as something esoteric and
“arty”.
4. Inferior artists have been imported,


given star billing and built up
extravagantly.
5 Productions have been so avant
garde and experimental that they
have created positive antagonism in
audiences
„ . , _ . ■,
T e ame or t e rs pom mus e
shared equa y . . i larnson s, e
Trust and, most importantly, the critics
worthy Efforts beyond a reasonable point
or condemn utterly something which can
be reasonably accented- there appears
to be r m L y d.e Saf harm wls
done by the excessive praise lavished on
“Ariadne auf Naxos” than the roasting of
“Rigoletto” in one season.
The endeavor of the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust to bring new works to
Australian music lovers is admirable.
But the catering to minority groups must
wait until the majority has been served.
Where can the public at large.see the
“Toscas” and “Trovatores” and “Barbers
of Seville” which are so necessary to the
inexperienced opera lover? With all the
cards in the Trust’s hand, how can it
justify a ratio of three novelties to one
popular opera in a four-work season? At
this stage it should definitely be three
pops to one classic, not the other way
rnnnd
ruunu -
The constant stressing of the Trust
and the Press of the '“cultural ’ and “edu-
cational value of opera has been little
short of the kiss of death for the medium
in this countrv Last vear the Trust ac-
tually published paid advertisements in
which the public were exhorted to buy
tickets “to help a good cause”! Who ever
heard of a good cause which was en-
tertaining? The total and absolute ignor-
ance of the Trust’s and Williamson’s pub-
licity staff in any matters operatic is really
astounding. There appears to be no liai-
son whatever between production and
advertising departments and there is
certainly no indication that anyone
knows what makes a customer buy a
ticket. But then, there is some doubt
whether the Trust realises that audiences
are made up of “customers”. It is con-
stantly appealing for “supporters”. When
people are offered value for money there
wiU be no need for “ support ». '
The Trust should build a public for
opera. Let the artistic and society types
find their own way to the theatre; they
always do. The great mass of theatre-
goers is interested only in a good night's
entertainment and that is exactly what
they are offered in the world’s great
opera houses. If they can be made to
believe that local opera does the same,
they will undoubtedly give it another try.
At P iesent J seems obvious that operas
are chosen for production and then
artists are sought to fill the parts Any
sensible management with a limited
supply of artists chooses operas which
are well within the limits of available
singers. It is hard to understand the
mentality which schedules a Traviata

e importation o singers ant ot er
artists presents problems for wh.ch Aus-
tralian managements must be given a
certain amount of sympathy. However,
the “international” standard of the last
Williamson seasons can be gauged by the
total disappearance from the operatic
scene of all but one of thbir last group
of guest stars. As for the “stars” imported
by the Trust, in most cases it would be
better if the fact of their being imports
were not mentioned at all; as supposedly
local artists they would at least receive
sympathetic consideration. Why bring a
tenor whose sole claim to fame was a
single leading part at the St Pancras
Town Hall (for which reviews were far
from good) 12,000 miles to Australia?
The result of this policy is hitting the
Sutherland-Williamson season right now.

, The harm done to opera in Aus "
traha h J poor artists cannot be
overestimated.
The question which is raised most
often, yet which is really the least im-
portant in this context, is that of pro-
duction standards. The Williamson corn-
panies> including the present, have al-
ways chosen to offer pedestrian tradi-
tional methods of design and production,
while one would wish for a Zeffirelli to
s h ow tbe way? we must be rea ii s ti c and
realise the impossibility of such a dream,
Tbe q- rust pro ductions, on the other
hand, have usually been much superior
j n actua l production techniques, cos-
tumes and scen ery. At times they have
~,c , , t
been superb and successful (remember
“Falstaff” or the last “Marriage of
Figaro”?), but generally they have hinged
around avant garde methods of stage pre-
sentation h in , he
b , . °
anas o a master producer wit an mter-
national cast. Even here in Australia such
experiments could prove successful once
i n a white- To continue them as a matter
policy year after year, presenting the
majority (!) of operas like this, is asking
for trouble.
What, if anything, is the Elizabethan


Theatre Trust going to learn from all
this? Is it going to use the year’s respite
it has been given by the Sutherland-
Williamson season to re-align its think-
ing. to plan perhaps for a new policy
aimed at a special effort towards the great
opportunity to outdo the present troupe
at the opening of the Sydney Opera
House?
The Trust has never been prone to
accept outside suggestions, running, like
the public service, on its chosen path
through all opposition. Criticism, even
when constructive, has no effect at all
and the directors appear to obtain some
kind of masochistic enjoyment from per-
sisting with things long after it is clear
that an obvious mistake has been made.
When their last production of “Faust”
was universally roasted for the inclusion
of some ludicrous and meaningless
modern slide projections, it would have
been easy to remove the slides and pre-
sent the opera with the remaining (far
from bad) costumes and scenery. But
that would have been a tacit admission
that an error had been made initially, and
that would never do, would it? I wonder
how many pounds of hard cash this one
little piece of stubbornness actually cost
the Trust at the box office.
All of this may be considered destruc-
tive criticism. Far from it! It is within
the Trust's power to correct any and all
of the failings mentioned and only by
correcting them will it bring opera back
on to the popular entertainment level.
Complaints about poor attendances
should be investigated at the head office,
not the box office.
ART
The Scarcity of Sculpture
By BILL HANNAN
THhe touring collection of recent Austra-
lian sculpture is at present sojourn-
ing in Melbourne, at the National
Gallery. It creates, surprisingly, a quite
peaceful in the high-vaulted
hall. Contemporary painting has led us to
expect a good deal of tumult and image-
shattering from a combined exhibition.
Sculpture is still much more sedate.
This may be one of the reasons why
this collection is the first in living
memory. Obviously, large collections of
sculpture are enormously difficult to
gather and transport. The absence of
Gerald Lewers, Margel Hinder, Lyndon
Dadswell, John Perceval and Donald
Friend is apologised for on these grounds.
But there is, undoubtedly, much less inter-
esting work to collect. The 24 represented
in the collection already spread the avail-
able talent too thinly. The mass could be
reduced by about a quarter without loss
of weight.
Even so the core is solid and deserves
more attention than it gets. Redpath,
Klippel and Meadmore stand out with-
out argument. Walker, Flugelman,
Jomantas, King, Lyle, Lenten Parr have
all by now reached excellence in expres-
sive styles. The chief disappointment is
the shortage of newcomers. George Bal-
dessin is the only one here still in his
twenties, and to my knowledge it would
be hard to find company for him. Paint-
ing is in a much happier position, as the
Museum of Modern Art’s current “New
Generation" demonstrates: two sculp-
tors among 26 painters.
There are, I think, two features of
this collection which legitimately worry
people. One is the comparative lack of
variety in purpose and even in method.
The other is the absence of a compelling,
original and perhaps local character. I
do not mean by this to brush off the
merit of individual achievements. There
is plenty here to admire, enjoy and even
be overawed by. If we want to adorn our
public lives with sculpture, we have the
talent, though we might have to over-
work it a bit. But the strength of an
assembly does not come solely from its
individuals. Several sculptors are working
well, but sculpture is still not a vital art
here.
What, for instance, will the next
generation be like? There will surely be
one, though it has not yet arisen in force.
How much of this work will it build on?
The dominant character of this collection
is its formalism. Meadmore, Jomantas,
King and Parr are severe abstractionists.
Klippel is too, though more elegant and
insouciant. Walker and Redpath are more
romantic: they evoke nature, but they,
too, abstract it, especially Redpath. And
so on.
Against this weight of formalism, the
only strong theme is the traditional
sculptor's one the human figure. If
Baldessin and his contemporaries are
signs of the future, this is the theme that
will take over, and it may not take much
of the present with it. I would prefer at
this stage (probably at any) to see much
more diversity and conflict.
Whether more intense and diverse
activity will lead to a marked local
character in sculpture is arguable. Cer-
tainly in this particular exhibition one
need not bother to look for a national
character because many of the best are
European by birth, training and inspira-
tion and have had no tradition that they
have thought worth drawing on here.
Without their work we would be strug-
gling to collect a show at all.
Obviously there is more flux in paint-
ing. The Museum of Modern Art has just
collected the New Generation from
Sydney and Melbourne, all but two of
them painters. Most of them are still in
their twenties, but old enough in these
boom days to have reputations and
known styles. If they can now be called
a New Generation it seems mainly be-
cause they are no longer brand new. In-
stead they are in the process of seeing
what can be done with the now familiar
horrid and comic figures, throbbing
optical patterns, geometry, constructions
and collage.
Where the figure is used the tendency
is to concenrate on it' internally, by dis-
tortion, rather than place it in an environ-
ment. This is true at least of George
Baldessin, Russell Drever, Robert Rooney,
Peter Creel and Gareth Sansom whose
figures create their own context and com-
ment, rather than draw meaning from
their situation in the way Mike Shaw’s
“Lawrence Diptych” does.
The largest single preoccupation of this
generation, particularly among the Syd-
ney painters, is with sundry forms of
powerful optical, geometric and color
effects: Trevor Vickers, Col Jordan,
Richard Larter, Merilyn Neate, Colin
Spencer, Dick Watkins. The optical
attacks, like Merilyn Neate's “Away We
Go”, seem to want to force themselves
on us by being impossible to look at,
like the oxy flames or eclipses of the
sun that irresistibly draw us against all
warnings. The comparatively quieter
and more expansive abstraction, like
Dick Watkins and Wendy Paramor, js
also very bright in color and fresh and
nervous with its sketchy open spaces.
I confess I enjoyed our New Genera-
tion more than I did New Zealand's seven
painters and one sculptor in the National
Gallery. The oldest of them, Colin
McCahon (b. 1919), is a forceful and
resolute worker in virtual black and
white with intensely simplified lines or
numerals. The youngest, Ross Ritchie
(b. 1941), works confidently in the
American Pop manner of partly oblitera-
ted and lettered-over figures painted in
advertising style. Another young man,
Don Binney (b. 1940), is the only one of
the eight to preserve landscape, in a semi-
primitive and sometimes very effective
style. Tim Garrity and Patrick Hanly,
both in their early thirties, are stimulating
painters, Hanly especially with his strong
figures on bare spaces, Garrity I thought
less so because of the obscurity of what
was plainly intended to be symbolic. The
sculptor, Greer Twist, uses slim muscular
figures in small-scale, closely combined
groups, often with very fine effect. None
of these is a particularly commanding
artist, but the overall tone cf the exhibi-
tion is nonetheless forceful and
optimistic.

THEATRE
Anglo-Saxon Sartre
Crime Passionel. Jean-Paul Sartre. St
Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
“FkEPmmoNS are never settled,” Sartre
has written. “One cannot define a
man before- he has died, or humanity
before it has vanished.” And again:
“Writers are constantly haunted by
qualms of conscience about the means
or about the ends, with the result that
we are always keeping something back.”
What we are keeping back is the last
truth which could define us this side
of the grave and which it is hard to
bear, namely that the only “end” is man
himself and that there are no means
which are either good or bad. Means
which lead a man to himself are good,
means which lead him away from him-
self are bad, and there is no third way
through religion and., ideology. This is
nihilism, and existentialism is a nihilist
philosophy, whatever its adherents may
claim. The fact is disguised by an
appeal to grandeur. Humanity cannot
struggle free but there is greatness in the
struggle. Outside France, Sartre is almost
always misunderstood because people try
to find in his work statements about the
individual and society which it does not
contain, and are bewildered by the man’s
political commitment which seems to run
counter to his pessimism. To read into
“Crime Passionel” a criticism of Com-
munists for the means they employ is
ridiculous; it is not a play that criticises
anything (least of all Communism, since
it was written at the time of “Les
Chemins de la Liberte”).
Its politics are merely a method of
demonstration, and it demonstrates, first,
that Sartre admires the beauty of con-
sequential action and, secondly, that no
system of salvation can be built on this,
as on any other, foundation. Beyond this
it indicates Sartre’s personal problem as
an intellectual who loves “heroes” and
as a man who believes that love explains
nothing.
The hero is Hoederer, leader of the
Proletarian Party, always ready to take
tactical advantage of the class enemy.
The intellectual is Hugo, who has been
sent to kill him as a traitor. Hugo is
drawn to his victim because Hoederer,
unlike himself, is strong enough to
resolve doubts in action he can only
shoot him when sexual jealousy becomes
his spur. He spends five years in prison
and when he comes out he discovers that
the group which made him an assassin
now carries out Hoederer’s policy. He is
given a chance to save his life he talks
too much and his comrades want to
liquidate him by affirming jealousy as
his motive for killing: thus he could fall
in, uncompromised, behind the victorious
faction. But this would make nonsense
of what he thinks are his ideals. His
lie becomes his truth and in letting him-
self be destroyed by the opportunists
(Hoederer’s spiritual twins) he gives
meaning to his original crime.
In fact, of course, he does not give
it meaning: his sole freedom is to imagine
that he does. To the last moment he
keeps talking about Raskolnikov . . .
Two women complicate his illusory
choice: Jessica, his wife, and Olga, his
comrade-gwn/. Jessica, although she is
a flapper, cannot love him until he
“defines” himself. In seducing Hoederer
she seduces Hugo to his destruction.
Olga does the opposite. Obsessed with
objective reason, she is a woman and
wants to save Hugo by making him con-
fess and accept his subjective motives.
Only a very gifted dramatist could
mix the levels as Sartre does and not
come a cropper, but even with him melo-
drama waits at the juncture of love
story and dialectics. (“Huis Clos”
presents a profounder argument more
hermetically, while “Men Without
Shadows” lacks effective contrasts.)
In “Crime Passionel” the really in-
teresting conflict lies in the love-hate
relationship binding Hugo to Hoederer,
reflecting so clearly Sartre’s surrender-
domination affaire with Thorez and
Duclos. He knows that in the context
of revolution the means - and - ends
dilemma is a phantom. He approves of
Hoederer Sartre is himself xff partly
German origin, like so many of his
characters, and Hoederer is very German
but, also being Hugo, he must find
a rationale. Honesty prevents him from
siding with either of his main characters.
Nihilism is the let-out of the feminine
man, the artist.
Raymond Westwell puts Hoederer
before us with magnificent directness
and cunning, showing us a leader whose
complex humanity is not contradicted
by his brutal decisiveness. He is earthy,
he is subtle and he is triumphant even
in death, not at all like Hugo whose
sacrifice can only be a gesture. It is a
tremendous performance which over-
shadows all others. John Rickard is a
less satisfying Hugo, but he is up against
the old problem of having to be Hamlet
in modern dress. There should be a
sleep-walking quality in his acting, not
only the half-conscious dissimulation of
the neurotic —a little more of Raskol-
nikov.
It seems that in Anglo-Saxon -produc-
tions Jessica always has to be a kitten.
This Judith Arthy manages almost too
well. When the joke ends and the
tragedy begins she has played herself
off-balance. Miss Greenall’s Olga remains
too deeply in the shadow of her
ideological widowhood to emerge as a
living female at the last. Karsky and
Prince Paul, the bourgeois and aristo-
cratic opponents of Hoederer, are sharply
realised by Joseph James and lan Boyce,
and Dennis Miller and Neville Thurgood
are good as the hate-laden bodyguards.
George Fairfax’s direction grapples
with fair results with a story in which
stagy surprises could easily distort the
main dramatic line, but paints the mood
too self-consciously in the opening and
closing scenes in Olga’s flat.

HPhe marionette world of the Tin-
*■ tookies is wonderfully crowded and
colorful. Characters like the Mayor and
the Astrologer, the Three Wise Monkeys
and the Magician, come from a long
tradition of comic theatre, and the knock-
about satire of such scenes as the meet-
ing of the town council and the learned
discussion of the wise monkeys will
delight the adult members of the
audience.
The children are more absorbed in
the doings of Possum, Koala and Wom-
bat, characters whom I find somewhat
cloying. However, the interweaving of
the more sentimentally conceived local
animals with characters of traditional
farce does make for richness and color.
But the plot seems to me over-compli-
cated and the action a little slow. Fewer
set pieces, imaginative though they are,
and swifter narrative would make the
programme a better length.
Alastair Duncan’s production of his
own adaptation of Goldoni’s play is
excellently done. The cast of ten is
thoroughly professional, Robert Lloyd’s
setting is attractive and efficient and
the music is delightful. The playing
time of U hours including the interval
seemed to me just right for a children’s
play.
The production is fortunate in having
A 1 Thomas as Truffaldino, the irrepres-
sible servant of two masters.' On the
day I saw it Mr Thomas made his
clown’s business over-fussy, but this may
have been due to an unresponsive
audience. Children need practice and
encouragement as playgoers if they are
to respond enthusiastically to theatre.
Goldoni, like Shakespeare and
Moliere, took traditional character types
of the commedia dell’arte and made
them more realistic. He has not the
poetry of Shakespeare nor the wit of
Moliere, but he has liveliness and
humor.
In his adaptation, Alastair Duncan
has retreated a little from Goldoni’s
realism by introducing a boy imp and
a girl imp whom he calls Spirits of the
Pantomime. While confusing to students
of drama, this is unlikely to worry the
children, for the imps are delightfully
played by Jon Ewing and Yvonne
Matthew.

Debunking the Bushrangers
By LEONIE KRAMER
The Hero of Too. David Martin. Cassell,
Australia. 40s.
T|avid Martin’s Tooramit (Too for
short) is a typical Australian
country town —so typical that one begins
to wonder whether it can be in any
sense real. It is about to celebrate its
founding day—but how? Its history is
unremarkable. It might, in fact, be any
one of a number of towns of the same
vintage.
It has known a gold rush, and then
a peaceful decline into farming. Rivalry
with its nearest neighbor, Boobyalla,
which expresses itself in bloody football
matches, keeps it from utter stagnation.
There is little material for pageantry
here. But Tooramit has one asset a
hero to some, a monster to be forgotten
to the respectable small-town “upper
crust”. He is Dick Grogan the bush-
ranger, who made his last stand against
the law at Tooramit bridge. Is he, or
is he not, to have a part in Tooramit’s
celebrations? Is he to relive his last
defiant moments, or is he to be buried
with the vanished past? The exploration
of this question provides the action of
the novel.
Factions are formed, feuds develop,
characters align themselves according to
rank and prejudice. Grogan is resur-
rected in the expectations and appre-
hensions of Tooramit. Eventually a
shaky compromise is reached between
the pro- and anti-Groganites. The great
day arrives; but before it is far advanced
the celebrations disintegrate into a wild
and uproarious free-for-all, provoked
and sustained by a series of absurd mis-
apprehensions.
From the outset David Martin estab-
lishes the exact comic flavor of the novel.
Our first meeting with the respectable
citizens of Tooramit is conventional
enough. But having established them in
all their uneasy and tentative authority,
he then takes us on a tour of the town
with Klep Quinn, ex-AIF, MM, the night-
cart man. We have caught a glimpse of
Tooramit society in the front room; now
we are invited to regard it from the
back of the house. This is not to say
that we are condemned to a minute
account of events better left to the
imagination. Far from it. Mr Martin
extracts the last ounce of comedy from
Klep Quinn’s observations of his clients,
without becoming either tedious or
facetious. And at the same time, though
preserving his comic angle, he lays
down one of the main lines of his novel
the snobbery of small-town society.
Klep, from its lowest level, has a clear
view of its unattainable heights.
So far all seems simple enough. “The
Hero of Too” is a comic romp, a com-
pound of burlesque and gentle satire.
The Tooramitians are ordinary enough,
even predictable. There is the doctor,
the lawyer, the merchant, the school-
teacher, the night-cart man with his
rowdy, disorganised family, presided over
by an ancient grandfather, Pongo Quinn,
who lives in a lean-to in the backyard.
There is the town hairdresser, a gallant
ex-Hungarian ex-aristocrat. There is
George Bollman, handsome young son
of the merchant, garage owner, Jaguar
owner, captain of the football team,
eligible. There are two pretty girls, one
dark, one fair, one upper, one lower
crust, and both in love with George.
There are mothers, gossips, and visiting
celebrities. All these ingredients combine
to make a picture of Australian life
recognisably true in its general outlines,
though distorted, fairly enough, for the
purposes of comedy. The mild satire
glances at many topics —at the local
pride of a small and relatively insignifi-
cant community, at its vulgarity, its
pettiness, the snobbery of its rising
merchant class, at the emptiness of its
leisure hours, consumed in beer and
Australian Rules football, at the mind-
less vigor of its young people. These
DAVID MARTIN
targets are hit accurately, but without
acidity. This is affectionate, not re-
proving, satire.
Yet there are curious fluctuations of
tone in the novel which undermine the
impression of consistency and unity
given by the comic plot. There are
times when young love is described with
a sentimentality which strikes one as
serious. The neat pairing-off in the last
pages would satisfy the reader of a
woman’s magazine, but there is no sign
that Mr Martin intends us to laugh
at the novelette manner. Klep Quinn
makes a drunken speech in which he
expresses his love for Tooramit and all
its people. Considering the angle from
which he usually views them, we might
accept this scene as an amusing comment
upon maudlin drunks and Australian
military heroes. Yet it lacks the tone of
satire; rather it seems to invite us to
consider love as the only antidote to the
pettiness and scheming of which we
have been shown a good deal.
And what of the hero of Too? Dick
Grogan, the intrepid bushranger, the
legendary idol of the underdog, turns
out to have been impotent. So the town
of Tooramit is denied even a lawless
hero. Does life then demand that the
legends be examined, and, if found want-
ing, rejected? Is Mr Martin enjoying
himself at the expense of the fashionable
interest in the Australian legend and in
the anti-hero? His remarks in “Meanjin”
in 1959 on the myth-making, symbolic
novels of Stow and White might lead us
to suppose so. Tooramit is situated on
the Vossler Highway, which is called
after the German explorer who left a
legend “which is a compound of poetic
mystery, ambiguous prose and bungling
in about equal proportions”. Yet I
doubt whether Mr Martin wants to
moralise his tale. He has had a lot of
fun in Tooramit; he enjoys the Vossler
joke just as he enjoys describing Sidney
Nolan-alias-Cedric Bolan’s portrait of
Grogan. For the reader there is never
a dull moment.

Amid the whirl of hurdygurdy sound
She sits posed breathless on a cardboard
moon,
This thin remote small child who draws
me right
Inside the photograph and offers me
A glance of secret and contained delight.
The grotesque smile that bends the moon
she does
Not see; the set that is designed for lovers
She makes solely hers, and dreaming
drowns
The heady jostle and the switch-back
screams
Where she has risen far above the towns.
She sees the groping giants in the trees,
The darkened earth inhabited by gentle
Light, till back upon the ground she’s
blind
To flashing colors, crowds still traces
out
And walks within the country of the
mind.

“I Fly Above the World”
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
My Life. Marc Chagall. Peter Owen.
545. 6d.
Qomewhere near rainbow’s end floats
the world of Marc Chagall, weight-
less, without gravity, accepting no
bounds save the limits of the painter’s
own strangely logical fantasy. There,
cows are invariably blue or green and
jump over the moon at will, grandfather
clocks pointing to ten-past-ten skim
above the rooftops on one azure wing,
blood-red angels hurtle in flames towards
a demented earth and a giant white
cockerel strides a purple landscape, a
tiny pair of lovers nestling in his tail
while an elongated scarlet bride curves
skywards like a genie from a lamp. Or,
as the artist himself expresses it in “My
Life", “Now the candle flares up to the
moon, now the moon flies down to our
arms ... I fly above the world”.
If “Life” ended for Marc Chagall
the autobiographer in Moscow in 1922,
Marc Chagall the artist is not only still
very much alive but at the age of 78
is engaged in a frenzy of painting that
stretches across the
globe: the new Metro-
politan at the Lincoln
Centre is getting fac-
ades 30 feet high (and
scenery for “The Magic
Flute”, by Chagall, the
Paris Opera already
has a ceiling ablaze
with his leaping birds
and blossoms, his stain-
ed-glass windows flare
in Christian cathedrals
and Jewish synagogues,
and his legendary can-
vases and drawings
continue to flow out
in a tireless stream
from his studio on the French Riviera.
Although the 3$ - year - old Chagall
finished “My Life” on the day he left
Russia for the last time, it has supplied
the missing key to his work. The Chagall
Salzburg Festival Exhibition of 1957
made an indelible impression but left
me still puzzled: does he make or does
he see the world like that? “My Life”
provides the definitive answer; in reveal-
ing himself he explains that the world
is like that.
For Chagall is not one of those in-
articulates whose thoughts take form
only in paint. As a piece of writing,
this autobiography is as individual and
as stimulating as his colors. The para-
graphs are brief, often only one short
sentence each. He has as little patience
with the conventions of words as for
MARC CHAGALL
the restrictions and fetters of the
numerous “schools” of his contempor-
aries, all of which he refused to join.
His pen levitates like his brush. It darts
from a horse-trough to his birth during
a fire in the Russian Jewish ghetto of
Witebsk to his uncle sitting on a roof
eating carrots and yet manages to tell
you everything you want to know, with
surprising clarity.
Marc was the eldest of a large, poor
family and his father worked hard carry-
ing huge barrels of salt herrings for a
boss with a fat stomach. From the first,
the boy was a dreamer in search of a
medium, but it was not until his school-
days that he discovered drawing. The
local form of the Hebrew religion forbade
graven images and when he told his
people he was going to be an artist,
no one even knew what that was! (Years
later Chagall was to illustrate both
Testaments of the Bible.) Baffled but
Jewishly sympathetic, his parents enrolled
him in “Penne’s School for Painting” but
he did not learn much and his sisters
used his canvases for
floormats while his
mother ordered him to
remove his first nude
from the wall. He was
failed in the entrance-
test to Baron Steglitz’s
School for Art at St
Petersburg because he
was a Jew. He learnt
nothing on a scholar-
ship at a lesser acad-
emy and little more
from the famous Bakst
Studio where he set up
his easel next to Count-
ess Tolstoy and the
dancer Nijinsky, so in
1910 he took the plunge for Paris.
There at last in the museums, exhibi-
tions and shop windows he found what
he had been looking for—“the very heart
of French painting”, Cezanne, Van
Gogh, Gaugin, Matisse and the rest.
He was taken up by the art critic and
poet Apollinaire who was one of the
few to see his originality in an era
besotted with Picasso and all the new
. . isms”. After the magazine “Sturm”
held an exhibition in Berlin in 1914,
Chagall, blissfully unaware of the real
storm about to break over Europe, re-
turned to Witebsk where he married
his beloved Bella although she was rich
and painted the famous village series
that was to put his home-town on the
artistic map. In what must be the record
for the shortest and most vivid descrip-

tion of the revolution, he writes: “Russia
was covered with ice. Lenin turned her
upside down the way I turn my
pictures.”
Appointing Chagall director of a
School of Fine Arts, the Communists
expected to receive busts of Lenin and
Marx and were present'd with green
cows and blue horses instead. While
his pre-war canvases were selling in
Berlin and the dealers pocketed all the
money, he painted murals and scenery
for a Moscow theatre and was still await-
ing payment after two years. Another
“. . . ism” had disappointed Chagall . . .
With his wife and young daughter
Ida he finally left for Paris. There he
continued to follow his own vision, the
one fixed point in a maze of rebellious
flurries of painf “Down with naturalism,
impressionism and realistic cubism! ...
Let them choke themselves with their
square pears on their triangular tables!”
Forty vears later Chagall still paints
only like Chagall. Compare the many
engravings and watercolors from around
1911 with which he has illustrated “My
Life” (unfortunately only in black-and-
white reproductions) with his 1958
“Creation ol Man” and there is nothing
to separate them stylistically but a little
more certainty and an added ripeness.
Even today his work still springs
basically from the land of “Peter and
the Wolf”, “The Firebird” and “The
Soldier’s Tale” where animals are as
important as people, perhaps more so,
where birds talk and Babushka con-
tinues to knead her bread and bake
hej pies, and the Devil is a man playing
a violin.
Chesty Bond
By CHARLES HIGHAM
The James Bond Dossier. Kingsley Amis.
Cape. 20s.
Perhaps the most striking thing about
the James Bond of lan Fleming’s
novels—the film persona takes on an
entirely different character—is the fact
that he is by no means a conventionally
heroic presence. He is less than six
feet tall, weighs about Ilf stone, drinks
rather more than is good for him, earns
less than £2OOO a year, suffers from
periodic impotence and is often down-
right stupid when in a jam. Critics have
said that the Len Deighton thrillers strip
the gloss from Bondsmanship: have they,
one wonders, read Bond? This tired,
troubled, physically unimpressive, ner-
vous and old-fashioned man is rather
closer to the harassed Mr Fleming him-
self than anyone has been prepared to
admit. One can’t quite see Sean Connery
dying out of condition at a Flemingish
age, and only in Bond’s habit of doing
push-ups and straight-leg raises in the
morning does one catch a hint on paper
of the celluloid figure Mr Connery
presents, all torso and insect brain. But
even there, James has his limitations:
only 20 push-ups? That wouldn’t do at
all for the final stages of the President
Kennedy fitness course.
Kingsley Amis, in a very curious work
called “The James Bond Dossier”, does
a nearly thorough run-down on the
character which for some reason omits
his vital statistics and his earnings.
Elsewhere, though, Mr Amis is almost
eerily familiar with every detail of
Bond, throughout displaying a total
fascination with his habits, tastes and
concerns. He knows when Bond orders
the wrong wine, when he sleeps with the
girl, and the way in which his career
echoes that of legendary heroes. Luckily,
Mr Amis doesn’t go as far as David
Ormerod and David Ward, two Kuala
Lumpur lecturers who in “The London
Magazine” earlier this year traced back
the Bond legend to Greek and other
myth-sources. Mr Amis knows the Bond
stories for what they are: wish-fulfil-
ment fantasies for adult males missing
their adolescence, tied up in marriage or
inhibited bachelorhood, nearing the
point at which they’ll be past their prime.
The origins of the Bond legend lie
more clearly in the straight line of spy
fiction than in more elevated sources,
and Mr Amis knows that, even if he does
get involved at least once in an Oedipal
theory. But oddly enough (despite
frequent and relevant references to
Sapper) he doesn't see that John
Buchan’s Richard Hannay and the hero
of the Valentine Williams Clubfoot saga
(most disgracefully forgotten these days)
are no less Bond’s literary parents.
Buchan s evil Norn woman, weaving
blindly the fate of her enemies in the
splendidly weird and xenophobic “The
Three Hostages”, and the club-foot
German hobbling around with a
massive stick in Williams’ saga, are direct
antecedents—even more so than Sapper’s
Carl Petersen—of Dr No, Drax or Gold-
finger. The combination of heady
patriotic fervor, sadism, skulduggery in
high places and threats to the well-being
of civilisation are all in the proper
tradition, and so are the emphases on
physical oddities: the club-foot and
Buchan’s laird's missing finger; Red
Grant’s sexual inertia, Rosa Klebb’s
lesbianism, Dr No’s claw hands and
unnatural tallness and thinness. And at
least one other borrowing of Fleming’s
has escaped Mr Amis’s notice: the death
of Dr No, smothered in the evil white
powder of the guano like a collapsing
snowman is a direct echo of the end of
Carl Dreyer’s celebrated film “Vampyr”
when the villain sinks helplessly under
the shifting, relentless drifts of flour
in an ancient mill.
“The James Bond Dossier” is certainly
one of Mr Amis’s oddest books; not so
much a work of analysis, or criticism,
as a hommage. His reason for writing it
apart from hard cash seldom
emerges, but here and there one can
find a hint: he eagerly analyses the faults
of Mr Fleming in the matters of his
hero’s gourmet appetite and his gunman-
ship, seeming to share in Bond’s ad-
ventures vicariously, yet taking note in
striking detail of the areas in which the
man falls short. Can it be that inside
at least One Fat Englishman a James
Bond is screaming to be let out?

1804-February, 1805. Facsimile edition.

& Robertson, with the backing of the

The Hobart Town Gazette and Southern
Reporter. Facsimile edition. Platypus
Publications Ltd, Hobart 635.
rHHis volume presents in facsimile the
second volume of the “Sydney
Gazette and New South Wales Adver-
tiser”. It was issued from the Govern-
ment printery under the strict super-
vision of the Government when there
was no other journal in Australia to
serve a population of 7000, of whom a
third were convicts in servitude and
most of the rest emancipists and their
families. Technically, it is the most
sophisticated job of facsimile printing
yet done in Australia. It is presented on
specially made paper by offset despite
vast difficulties in the way of illegibili-
ties and damage to the originals, of
which not more than 100 usually were
printed. The “Gazette” was issued on
Sundays when George Howe’s printers
and compositors were apt to have been
enjoying unconfined jollity rather than
the solaces of Holy Church.
The year 1804-5 gave the staff plenty
to.write about when the Government
would permit. The volume opens with
a ball (which seems to have been one
to end all balls) given by the officers
of HMS Calcutta in Sydney Cove, and
followed immediately by an Irish rebel-
lion out at Castle Hill and Parramatta,
suppressed with unexampled courage by
Major Johnston, and described with a
nice restraint that leaves the gory details
to those of the rebels and their friends
who were not hanging by the wayside
after hurried trials under martial law.
Mrs-John Macarthur re-created the ex-
citement of the occasion in her private
correspondence far more graphically
than the official records in the “Gazette”,
since she wasn't subject to Governor
King’s rigid censorship.
Even when there was no Irish rebel-
lion in progress, Sydney was a livelier
and more exotic place to live in 1804-5
than in 1964-5, .even if less excitable.
The editor of the “Gazette” found the
absconding of a whole band of criminals
worth only a list of their names, while
a single escape today generates columns
of descriptions of the hunt. But the
1804-5 approach could only have been
natural in a community in which one
never knew whether or when it would
be necessary, like poor Mr Wiltshire,
the Assistant Commissary, to organise
off the cuff an expedition “armed with
firelocks” to the savage wilds of Lane
Cove on receipt of the news that a
couple of hundred savage Cammerays
had tied up all one’s servants, guzzled
all the brandy and gobbled all the
poultry.
Though there was no theatre to pro-
vide the “Gazette” with theatrical adver-
tisements there was the gallows at the
corner of Bathurst and Castlereagh
Streets to which, at intervals, “the male-
factor was in a cart conveyed to the
spot at which he was to atone for his
offences by an ignominious end, and by
his awful example to inspire a just
abhorrence to crime”. Usually he pre-
faced what the “Gazette” was apt to
describe as his “sudden departure for
an unknown region” by a “short
harangue”, after which the survivors of
the scene repaired to High Street to
lunch off the “well constructed mutton
pyes ready for issue” at the premises of
Mr William Chapman.
Published simultaneously with the
“Sydney Gazette”, on similar paper and
with similar technique, are Volumes I
and II of the “Hobart Town Gazette”,
covering the period May 11, 1816 to
December 27, 1817.
If it is conceded that the “Tasmanian
Government Gazette” is the same jour-
nal in reformed guise, as the Chairman
of the Tasmanian National Trust, Dr
Craig, claims in his introduction, the
paper will next year celebrate its 150th
anniversary as the Commonwealth’s
oldest paper. It is, however, a far cry
today from the salty and historic sheet
in which that tough old founder of Tas-
mania’s free Press, Andrew Bent, and
his vigorous and irreverent battery of
journalists lambasted Governor Arthur.
Bent, Robert Lathrop Murray and
Andrew Melville made themselves part
of Tasmanian history and were as power-
ful a combination as Wentworth, Wardell
and Smith Hall in Sydney. Moreover,
Bent was ahead of his northern neigh-
bors in his services to Australian litera-
ture, for he published the very first
general work published in Australia in
“Michael Howe, the Last and Worst of
the Bushrangers of Van Diemen’s Land”
from the “Gazette” office in 1818.
He also published those two curious
books of Savery’s, “The Hermit in Van
Diemen’s Land” (1829), the first book
of essays written and printed on this
continent, and our first-born novel,
“Quintus Servinton”, in 1831.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Tight-money Bargains
CHARE prices on the Stock Exchanges in Australia have been slipping and a major
portion of the blame has been attributed to the weight of new share issues. “The
Bulletin” recognised this previously, but other factors must not be overlooked.
The tightness of money, the effects
of the drought, prospects of another big
trade deficit in 1965-66 and a rise in
wage costs have helped to put a damper
on enthusiasm.
Mr Staniforth Ricketson of Melbourne
says that the upward pressure on interest
rates is likely to continue. He suggests
that the Government will not achieve
its loan-raising target without increases
in bond rates.
If interest rates remain high, the ten-
dency naturally is for investors to seek
better yields on their investments. So
there is an inclination to reduce share
prices to achieve a higher income return.
On the face of it, there is not much
encouragement for investors to go wild
about share prices. However, the nega-
tive attitude should not be carried too.
far. We have pointed out here in a pre-
vious comment that there are definite
signs of cost inflation in Australia.
It has been shown that, when money
values decline, a hedge into property or
share investments is one method of keep-
ing pace with the declining pound.
Looking well ahead, and taking into
consideration the problems of overseas
buyers (including the prospects of ster-
ling devaluation), it is worth recognising
that Australia is still a rapidly expanding
nation and its mineral developments are
going to attract a lot more attention
from overseas.
On this basis it would be unwise to
disown .the share market entirely. Al-
though the Financial Editor’s comment
in this column has been “bearish” for
more than a year, it is now possible to
suggest that tight money conditions in
the next few months could provide some
relative bargains in the flood of rights to
new share issues.
Sugar Reappraisal
SPHERE is an old saying in the stock
market about “Buy in Gloom”. A
reminder of the opposite came last week
when Millaquin Sugar's result was pub-
lished, showing a drop in earning rate
from 36.3 p.c. to 24.2 p.c.
A year ago everyone was madly keen
on sugar shares and prices spiralled
sharply because of the boom in world
sugar prices.
At that time the writer became un-
popular with buyers of sugar shares for
asserting that the record sugar prices
(over £stgloo per ton) would only stimu-
late growers and cause a reaction.
Now that sugar prices have plummet-
ed, it may not be out of place to say
they could be too low. Looking coldly
at the earning rates of Australian pro-
ducers like Millaquin and Pioneer, it is
safe to say that the market prices for
these shares are far more attractive than
they were during the boom.
With yields of 5.5 p.c. and 6.8 p.c.
respectively, the market is being more
sober in its outlook. Even agreeing that
share prices could come lower, there is
less risk of a big capital loss compared
with the time when such shares were
substantially higher.
The International Sugar Conference
in Geneva on September 20 will attempt
to do something about the low sugar
prices now prevailing. Attempts will be
made to fix sugar quotas.
It will not be a simple task to estab-
lish more orderly marketing against the
requirements, and the US move to give
FRANK NICKLIN
American sugar producers a larger share
of the domestic market.
But, with Australia relying more on
world markets to absorb expanding pro-
duction, Australia’s Trade Minister, Mr
McEwen, and Queensland Premier Mr
Nicklin will attend the final stages of the
Geneva conference to press for stable
prices.
No miracles are expected, because the
consuming nations also will have their
say about quotas and fair prices. Yet
something needs to be done about pres-
ent uneconomic prices. If not, growers
will drop out again and this could force
another unhealthy fluctuation on the
free market.
British and American Share Markets
and New York share markets
each managed a lively enough little
spurt right at the end of last week's deal-
ings and after somewhat tepid beginnings.
In neither case does the more widely
spread cheerfulness suggest that the long-
held mood of caution is anywhere near
complete dissipation. Enough major
economic and technical factors remain to
be resolved at both centres.
Very specific happenings, too, seem
likely to make their influence felt over the
next few days. London must absorb the
political implications of the death of the
Speaker of the House of Commons. Wall
Street has still to operate in the shadow of
a possible steel crisis. First reactions to
these events were certainly more positive
than could perhaps have been expected.
London jobbers started by marking
shares up with the hope of an early
election and the presumable return of a
Conservative Government. It did not take
Mr Wilson long, though, to announce his
firm intention to stay in power, adding a
rider that the Labor Government now
envisaged a faster improvement in the
balance of payments position.
Certainly a good number of sources see
sterling under rather less pressure than
formerly and believing that the previously
forecast autumn difficulties may not
eventuate. This kind of feeling, aided by
some institutional activity, kept the markets
up, giving a firm end to the week.
Volumes are not especially high, however.
The better mood brought with it a
measure of interest in leader stocks.
Courtaulds, Vickers, AEI, and Turner and
Newall posted advances. ICI held in the
face of its huge £5O million loan issue.
Much the same leader interest showed
itself in Wall Street, again for the first
time in several weeks. On quite healthy
volumes the blue chips came into line
with the earlier sought defence stocks.
Noteworthy last week was the disappear-
ance of the recently characteristic wave
of Friday profit-taking.
Not only does New York continue to feel
that the President will finally succeed in
settling the steel troubles. The whole
economy is viewed hopefully. A moderate
inflationary push (signified by some basic
price increases and defence spending)
should further stimulate the latest market
rise. _


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Share Markets Come
Under Suspicion
The foolishness of spring fever
T IKE the spring in Melbourne this year the recent rise in share markets has belied
its early promise. For a while there, some brokers thought they were set for
high summer. Their early chorus was that, by eschewing new strictures on business,
the Budget provided the missing link of confidence to the chain of favorable local
influence which would lift the market out of its trough.
Instead, as after the spirited flurry in
January, there has been no follow-
through to the initial spurt. In a strait-
ened mood, early-bird brokers have had
to admit to counting their chickens ahead
of the clock. Others like Mr Staniforth
Ricketson, who were reticent to pick up
worms in mid-August, have been in the
superior position of waiting to see them
before analysing the prospects.
In his address to shareholders of Sher-
bourne Investments in Melbourne last
week Mr Ricketson underlined two of
the points made here in the issue of Aug-
ust 28. One, whose import is becoming
more obvious almost daily, is the spate
of new issues to be accommodated. The
other is less articulate caution on the
future trend of interest rates.
Talking about the first of these, he
pointed out that equity issues already
announced will call for almost £27 mil-
lion by the end of the calendar year and
one may take it that the amount to be
found will exceed that amount by a con-
siderable margin. Many companies up
and down the land have been awaiting
a favorable market opportunity to raise
new money. Even if markets continue to
move within their present depressed
range, quite a few of them will have to
take the plunge, if only to replenish
their supplies of working capital, not

five at 50 p.c. premium, about £5
million by CSR in a one-for-eight issue
also at 50 p.c. premium, a number of
others for small sums like ACF and
Shirleys (£1,555,000), Ampol Explora-
tion (£937,000), and many more for
smaller but still very substantial amounts.
The fact that Mr Ricketson’s tally in-
cludes such a large number of issues an-
nounced before the Budget underlines
the urgency with which many of the
companies have had to come to the mar-
ket. Mr Ricketson instances the tight
lending policy of the banks as being
partly responsible for this. Equally, it
can be said, it has been caused by in-
creases in the capital requirements of
the companies concerned over and above
what they can find from their internal
resources. Unfortunately the latter mar-
gin has greatly narrowed in the last year
or so, because cash flows have been in-
creasing at a lower rate (as have profits
generally), increases in wages and mater-
ial costs have required more capital to
finance and because of the fuller ab-
sorption of liquid funds for operational
needs.
In sharing our caution on interest
rates, Mr Ricketson said he envisaged
continued upward pressures. He was ap-
parently not thinking so much of the
prospect for diminishing liquidity in the
system as a whole (though doubtless he
is well aware of it), but more of the
imponderables facing the Government in
the loan market this year. Thus, “it re-
mains doubtful whether or not the re-
duced loan-raising target can be achieved
without further increases in the rates of-
fered on Commonwealth securities,” he
said.
As it would be foolish of the Govern-
ment to imperil its internal borrowing
status by not increasing interest rates if
this were required to meet its loan tar-
gets and accomplish the highest possible
rate of conversions of the massive vol-
ume of maturities of old loans coming
up this year (particularly next May), one
counting what they may need for financ-
ing fixed investment.
As a matter of fact the great bulk
of the money being sought by companies
in the next few months is for new issues
announced before the Budget. These
include 10s. a share application money
or half the £l6 million being sought by
BHP in its one-for-seven issue at par,
£6 million by Woolworths in a one-for-

trays."


must presume that, whatever direction
may be dictated by economic balance to
monetary policy, the Federal Treasurer
would have to call the tune.
The big question for the share market
would seem to be whether any projected
increase in Government borrowing rates
is to be expected in the next few months
or whether it would be phased in with
loans floated in the second half of the
year after the seasonally flush period for
liquidity. A primary consideration here
would be whether any change in borrow-
ing rates would be advisable in the next
few months on general economic
grounds. There was nothing in the Re-
serve Bank’s annual report to suggest
that a change either way would be re-
quired for this purpose. The presump-
tion is simply that credit will be kept
tight rather than deliberately increased
in price by official action to maintain
the economic balance.
However, Mr Ricketson hints that
monetary policy could be brought into
action much sooner than one might
think. His argument is based on his view
of the Budget. “The attitudes and action
of the Reserve Bank during the next few
months,” he stated, “could be of far
greater significance than would have been
the case had the Budget provided a less
tentative framework for forward plan-
ning by industry. Further, the Budget has
in effect left a great deal of initiative
with the Reserve Bank and the task of
determining monetary policy will be far
from simple.”
In saying this, Mr Ricketson may well
be implying that monetary policy cor-
rectives will possibly be required in the
next few months, presumably to restrain
economic activity. I would find it hard
to go along with that because, although
the pressures towards intolerable strains
on resources may well get much closer
if the defence effort builds up more
rapidly than at present, they would not
appear to be right on top of us. Indeed,
if anything, activity in some of the vital
sectors such as motor and building in-
dustries has abated a bit in recent
months and, contrary to some expecta-
tions, the share market remains in the
doldrums.
The share market’s reluctance to take
the Budget bull by the horns, in face of
a series of very good company profit re-
sults, at least in part reflects the more
sober internal economic tone as well as
new issue selling, caution about interest
rates and other local factors. Investors
are disinclined to discount a boom they
cannot see. However, the most dampen-
ing influence could well be coming from
external economic and political factors
which have played the background music
to markets all this year. It was these
which really sent the bulls scurrying in
January and they continue to have a big
bearing on the level of market overall.
Mr Ricketson hasn’t forgotten these
either. On this occasion he doesn’t go
into such favorite topics of his as capi-
ta! inflow and the balance of payments,
which are obviously of importance if
not critical in market calculations at
present. Instead he put his finger on a
possibility of real and vital moment
which is very much on brokers’ minds,
that is, devaluation. He comes to the
conclusion that if sterling is devalued
Australia might have to go part of the
way down with it He thinks, as we do,
that it would be much more difficult to
justify a significant devaluation of the
Australian pound at this time than it was
in 1949. In any case Australia cannot
afford to be caught napping.
In sum, the variety of factors causing
the retreat of markets from their post-
Budget peaks is wide enough to cause
all but the most abandoned of market
pundits to pause. With Dr Coombs ever
alert to clamp down at the mere whiff
of a boom caused, say, from excess
fixed investments, the difficulty is to see
any sufficiently strong bullish influence,
except devaluation itself, which could
put new more enduring life into them
than their burst of spring fever after the
Budget.
CROESUS
Ready for the Royal
Annual pilgrimage to the studs
OTUD business is big money business but the units are small alongside the giants in
factory industry. More often than not they can be man and wife affairs, like,
say, the Goodes’ Friesian stud at Ebden in N-E Victoria, or Simpson’s for racehorses
at Khancoban across the border in NSW. Even Reg Board’s Jersey stud near
Alexandria has a homely look, despite the royal treatment afforded the ancient queen
of the Francliffs, its PR angles and loudspeakers in its sale rooms.
These may make the father and son
affair of the Maloneys’ Belgonia stud, its
great Jersey rival, at Tongala look almost
amateur. Streamlined though they be,
somehow even the wondrous radio-tuned
milking yards at the “Vermont” Guernsey
stud of Dr F. G. Stevens, the daddy of
Collins Street farmers, at West Road-
side outside Tatura still need the owner’s
personal touch. The keynote of the stud
business is the dedication of proprietors.
Their main shop window is the Royal
Show.
If this all sounds well off the beaten
track for Croesus, let me say that for
the past five years he’s been making an
annual pilgrimage to Victorian studs at
the kind invitation of the Royal Agri-
cultural Society of Victoria, whose
annual Royal Show opens on September
16 and goes on for nine days. In the
course of this period these tours have
taken him into pretty well every corner
of Victoria to pick the brains of some
of the greatest studmasters in the land.
He ventures to suggest that if the Mel-
bourne metropolitan dailies had also
been along they would now be giving
a better coverage of rural affairs than
they are doing at the moment. (The
Sydney dailies leave them for dead on
country matters.) None of them was
represented on this year’s tour to the
north-eastern sector of the State.
Apparently they are very reluctant to
accept commercial sponsorship of this
sort of tour, designed to give journalists
valuable background information.
Although holding no brief for any par-
ticular oil company, be it run by Angus
Jones, Hamilton Sleigh or even Mavis
Bramston, I cannot help feeling that the
one run by Lewis Luxton from a certain
corner on lower Bourke Street is mixing
business with national service to the
nicety in sponsoring these pre-show ex-
cursions to the country. They provide
journalists of several States with a
golden opportunity to become better
acquainted with the farming fraternity,
their lands and their produce in the full
tide of its preparations for Royal Shows.
The Bulletin has been in on these tours
since they started nine years ago. The
annual ceremonies involving the some-
what unorthodox “Bulletin Cup”
attest this.
Flying as this year’s party did over
the Snowy uplands in the full flush of
spring, looking down on dams in the
making and the country back and front
of Corryong, was a pleasant prelude to
the real business of the tour. This was
to discover what was going on below,
W'hat could only be seen close up and
heard face to face—not only about the
studs but also about what is occupying
the fields, steps taken to stop soil erosion,
conserve water, plant new forests, to
grow hops, tobacco and grapes.
Here also was an opportunity to find
out, at first hand, rural reactions to
some of the topics which have recently
been examined in these pages, such as
the reserve price scheme for wool
marketing, rural credits, stabilisation
schemes, drought, and so on. Admittedly
the upper Murray, Ovens, Mitta Mitta
and Kiewa River valleys hold more

cattle than sheep; if they ran sheep,
farmers usually did it only as an ancil-
lary activity to cattle. But as votes of
practically anybody running sheep will
count .in the “rigged” referendum on the
reserve price scheme, it was illuminating
to find that practically all the farmers
I talked to seemed pretty ignorant of
what the scheme entailed.
One of the more knowledgeable said
they would mostly be “voting in the
dark”, and many as captives of the
ebullience of Sir William Gunn. The
main thought to attract them was that
the reserve price scheme would lead the
way to some form of appraisal or acquisi-
tion arrangement which would give wool-
growers the same sort of enviable deal
as the wheat farmers got through wheat
stabilisation.
On the other hand an RAS councillor
with a big sheep run near Wangaratta,
who joined the party for the last stages
of the tour, had different ideas. Last
season he had paid out £lOOO to a wool-
broking firm, mostly for holding for
one week 150 bales of wool awaiting
auction. He was frankly disturbed at
what the ultimate cost of holding bought-
in wool might run to under the proposed
reserve price scheme and also about the
likely cost of scheme for taxpayers.
When I suggested tha-t the Government
should have another look at the scheme
from this angle, he heartily agreed. His,
I felt, was one vote Sir William would
not get. This all underlines the absurdity
of not weighting the vote according to
the size of each woolgrower’s clip.
Equally edifying was to hear farmers’
views on the availability of capital. Here
and there I heard complaints of the
limited availability of medium and long
term credit for farmers. I was surprised
to find a general ignorance of the activi-
ties of the Commonwealth Development
Bank. It was suggested by one farmer
who addressed the party that a new
institution should be set up to provide
medium-term capital for rural industries.
There would seem to be a case for the
Development Bank to expand its field
force and also for the trading banks to
push on with their mooted fund to pro-
vide longer-term capital, either as an
extension of their present Term Fund
or alternatively as a separate institution.
However, my impression was that, if
marshalling facilities may need im-
proving, there is no actual shortage of
capital in the area. So much is evident
from the financial (as well as the
operating) strength of the co-operatives
in the north-east, particularly the North
Eastern Dairy at Kiewa. I was assured
that, with its embracing arm on the
dairy farmers over a 1000 square miles
area covering as far north as Wagga
and west to Corowa, this co-operative
has no trouble at all in raising the neces-
sary funds for its rapidly expanding
activities. Incidentally, as well as making
a wide range of dairy products, the NED
has the biggest piggery in Australia
(across the ranges at Myrtleford, where
the best tobacco land goes for £lOOO
an acre, I also looked at the biggest
tobacco farm in Australia).
Talking about the studs themselves, a
newspaper has to remember the stock
owners have their eye primarily on sell-
ing at the Royal and district shows or
elsewhere. So, as regards both presenta-
tion and stock qualities, this is not the
place to compare merits, in any case
something for experts only. Even so,
some studs on this tour were unique, at
least t 0 the amate ur eye.

NOW
IS THE TIME
TO DRINK AUSTRALIAN WHISKY
THE MAN ON THE LAND
Farms and Vertical Integration
Bypassing the producer boards
rpHE giant British Tobacco group recently bought a 50 per cent interest in Sou’West
Frozen Food Packers Ltd, the holding company for the Sunkist group. In its
handout, the British Tobacco people said the move was “in line with other pur-
chases in Western Australia, Queensland and NSW”. Earlier this year British Tobacco
bought a controlling interest in another Victorian frozen food company, Frozo Foods.
Ice cream, pastry, and frozen peas
and beans thus come under the control
of a company which started out selling
penny Capstans. That’s business, and the
growth of the British Tobacco Company
is not the concern of this article.
The operation is, however, a classic
example of that vertical integration
which may change the face of Australian
agriculture even more rapidly than the
observant few realise. The majority of
farmers, if they do not get with it
very quickly indeed, may find themselves
redundant.
Sunkist, now under the protective
arm of British Tobacco, was one of the
pioneers of contract pea and bean grow-
ing in Australia.
The quick frozen pea and bean in-
dustry is largely centred on Victoria and
Tasmania. It is nearly all vertically in-
tegrated. Instead of the farmer harvest-
ing his peas and beans and selling them
in a market, he farms on contract.
This means that he agrees to provide
the land and care for the growing crops.
The planting and the harvesting are done
by machines provided by the vertical in-
tegrator, the seed also. To make the job
even easier for the farmer, the vertical
integrator sends out specialist advisers
every so often to make sure that the
grubs and weevils aren’t into the crop.
To date, everyone seems happy with
the system. The housewife certainly buys
frozen peas and beans by the billion in
the shops. There is an over-supply of
farmers willing to make land available
and British Tobacco evidently is suf-
ficiently impressed to want to buy into
the operation.
Frozen pea production alone rose from
33 million lbs to 55 million lbs last
year. Beans would not approach any-
thing like this volume, but are on the
increase. So, too, are tomatoes and
sweetcorn.
Now whatever may be thought of this
system in principle, one thing has to be
faced realistically. It is paying and it is
able to pay without calling for 'a gov-
ernment subsidy. There are no producer
boards and no market agents. This, in-
trinsically, is a tremendous strength.
Any government, no matter what its
complexion, must be impressed with a
primary industry operation which does
not put out the hand for a subsidy from
the general taxpayers’ pockets. It will
be the more prepared to help in other
directions tariffs (if needed), perhaps.
T>roducer boards are the holy of holies
for the majority of Australia’s farm-
ers. They have a real bearing on the
general farmer attitude to all kinds of
questions. They are almost a way of life
with dairy-farmers and wheat farmers
particularly.
One of the disquieting aspects of pro-
ducer boards, though, is that they tend
to shut the door on newcomers. This
does not happen by intention so much
as a matter of course. The very stability
of incomes guaranteed by producer
boards tends to put an unrealistic value
on properties. Only the very wealthy, or
the very lucky, can afford the price of a
farm.
In most informed circles the drift
from the land is accepted as inevitable.
Only a week or so ago, the Australian
Institute of Agricultural Science, meet-
ing in Hobart, was told that there would
be fewer opportunities for employment
in rural occupations and that fewer
children from farms would return to the
land.
One speaker, Mr J. A. Sutherland,
senior lecturer in agriculture at the Armi-
dale Teachers’ College, said that the ad-
vance in technology would inevitably
have this result. The technological ad-
vance is perhaps largely responsible for
farms becoming bigger and employment
scarcer. Now there is something amiss
here (not in Mr Sutherland’s argument,
for he is quite right). But if land was
cheaper, surely the very availability of
improved machinery and so on would
enable more young men to develop farms
of their own; there is any amount of
land.
You only have to look at any rural
paper and see the number of properties
listed for sale every week. Yet they
range from £12,000 for a battler’s farm
to £200,000. Who has that sort of money?
No one has ever attempted to define
in exact terms the effect* of the dairy
subsidy and the wheat subsidy on land
values. Let us simply say that it would
be a considerable effect. Likewise there
is an enormous influence on market
garden land values within trucking dist-
ance of the large cities. This comes from
the pressures of the subdividers and real
estate developers.
There are people in the community,
of course, who would do away with this
very simply. The communists have one
answer; the Henry Georgists, Douglas
Creditors and so on would do it another
way. Suffice to say that any of these
alternatives, different as they may be,,
come close to revolution. People do not
want them or they would have accepted
them many, many years ago. Any un-
compromising economic theory, whether
pure Marxist or anything else, does not
work if it remains uncompromising.
The best example of this is the cur-
rent revision of thought in Russia and
the return to “profitability”.
Now in vertical integration, perhaps,
there is a workable compromise. These
integrators need now, and will need
more and more in the future, trained
personnel. They will need advisers, tech-
nicians, agronomists, salesmen,
etc.
Computers will undoubtedly be used

to ensure that the right quantity of pro-
duce comes forward at the right time,
in exact proportion to consumer de-
mand. These will require skilled oper-
ators. Shortage and glut, the bane of the
traditional food producer, will be elim-
inated.
The young man who likes the idea
of farming, but lacks the capital, there-
fore does have an alternative. He can
seek a technical or an academic educa-
tion which will suit him for one of these
openings. As an employee of a large
vertical integrator he could make as
much money, probably more, than bat-
tling on a small farm of his own. He
may even enjoy a little more status,
which is not unimportant (though it
ought to be).
Australia, really, is ready made for
this development. We have no large, im-
poverished “field hand” community that
would be displaced by the machines. We
have literally thousands of farmers own-
ing large acreages which, in terms of
potential usage, are wasted on sheep.
There is no threat involved here. Many
farmers will, for their own gain, be pre-
pared to lease a hundred acres here and
fifty there to vertical integrators growing
various kinds of crops.
The possibility arises, naturally, that
vertical integration might become so ad-
vanced that the established producer
boards could be by-passed. The minute
this looks like happening there will be
trouble. There is, already, in eggs.
The CEMA plan was Conceived in the
classic Australian producer board spirit.
But it ignored two vital facts.
• A large proportion of egg raisers
(possibly 50 per cent, though no one
knows) had already made up their minds
that they could do better outside Egg
Board control.
• The great bulk of eating-poultry
(broilers) had already passed from the
traditional poultry farmer to the vertical
integrator operation.
A producer board for poultry farmers
which excludes broilers is, in itself, con-
tradictory. CEMA, as predicted in these
columns, is now to be challenged in
court.
It should be an interesting case, though
one hesitates to predict the outcome.
Whatever happens, the planners must
begin to come to terms with the unplan-
ned, but inevitable, result of so much
planning. If men of energy and initiative
can see a way to supply consumers with
the things consumers want at the price
they want to pay, then obviously they are
a force to be reckoned with.
It is just possible that the producer
board concept has outlived its useful-
ness. British agriculture was heavily pro-
ducer board minded for many years. To-
day, under a Labor Government, we see
the unbelievable happening. Thousands
of small farmers, who were to be pro-
tected for all time by the producer
boards, are actually being bought out by
the Government and their land re-sold
to large operators who can make farm-
ing pay with less subsidy.
“There is no question of the State
running farms,” says Agriculture Minis-
ter Fred Peart. “The land will be sold
for incorporation into other farms.”
Some 90,000 small holdings are schedul-
ed for buying in by the Government.
It seems so oddly out of character
with a British Labor Government that
one can only assume it is a case of neces-
sity being a harsh mistress. The Rus-
sians, with their new ideas of profit mak-
ing, doubtless are motivated by neces-
sity also. In the long run aren’t we all?
This writer does not pretend to know
the answers to even part of the vexing
question of producer boards and verti-
cal integration. As we have so many
symposiums, on so many strange and
wondrous subjects, it seems reasonable
to suggest that a symposium on vertical
integration be held. The quicker the bet-
ter because this is urgent. No one knows
enough about it, not even the people in
the thick of it.
This writer has questioned a number
of men working for vertical integration
operations and all of them give the im-
pression of simply doing their job as
best they cm. There appears to be no
sinister master-minding, no ivory-tower
theorising. It is just happening and gath-
ering momentum as it goes along. That,
come to think of it, may be an indica-
tion of strength rather than weakness.

Some Recent Advances
Sudden Death
!>eports of sheep collapsing suddenly
* when grazing Phalaris tuberosa are
becoming more alarming. Recently, for
instance, 40 Merinos in a flock of 1400
depastured on phalaris on the south-
western slopes dropped dead within two
days of beginning to graze. In previous
reports, of which there have been quite
a few over the last two years, smaller
numbers of sheep died in each instance.
Phalaris is being sown more widely
throughout south-eastern Australia as
more and more farmers and graziers
come to appreciate its relatively high
productivity. Fortunately, toxicity only
develops under certain circumstances,


though these are not yet fully defined.
The new season’s growth after the autumn
break seems to be most dangerous, es-
pecially if clover growth is not occurring
at the same time. Because of the drought
this year clover growth has been depres-
sed and the deaths are occurring after
the w'inter rains.
CSIRO scientists have linked this new
development with “phalaris staggers”,
which has been recognised for some
years. They believe that staggers is the
chronic form of the disease. It is more
common in South Australia, whereas the
acute form generally arises in New
South Wales. The reason for this is not
yet known Some evidence suggests that
low soil fertility suppresses the formation
of toxin in the grass Possibly the phal-
aris pastures in South Australia contain
a smaller proportion of phalaris in them,
or they grow less rapidly after rain and
so the sheep’s intake of poison is more
gradual.
About the time of the first reports
of “sudden death”, Dr C. C. J. Cul-
venor, who works in the CSIRO divi-
sion of organic chemistry at Melbourne
and whose interest is plant alkaloids,
found a new group of these compounds
occurring, strangely, in P. tuberosa. Al-
kaloids, examples of which are digit-
alis, belladonna, nux-vomica, etc., are
rare in the grass family of plants. Dr
Culvenor has since isolated the same
dimenthylated tryptamine alkaloids from
a few other species of plants and from
lower vertebrates, but not from mam-
mals.
Scientists at the McMaster Laboratory
have administered small doses of these
tryptamine alkaloids to sheep and to
small laboratory animals. The effects
have been identical with the signs dis-
played by sheep naturally afflicted with
acute phalaris staggers. Larger doses
proved fatal to the animals, which died
of acute heart failure just as happens in
the paddock. The results were the same
whether the alkaloids were injected dir-
ectly into the veins, under the skin, or
into the stomach. Only the time taken
for the effects to show varied. After
jugular injection the typical nervous
disorder is apparent within 15 seconds.
Oral' administration causes trouble a
mere six minutes later, showing that the
alkaloid is rapidly absorbed from the
gut. However, clinical symptoms re-
sembling the chronic phalaris staggers
have not yet been reproduced artificially.
About three years ago overseas scien-
tists found that a compound known as
serotonin occurs m mammals and is re-
sponsible for the normal functioning of
the brain and the nervous system that
regulates the heart. The McMaster scien-
tists now suspect that the phalaris alka-
loids inactivate serotonin. Whether it will
be possible or practicable to buffer such
interference by giving sheep an anti-
dote remains to be seen. Alternatively,
now that the harmful principle of phal-
aris has been recognised, it may be pos-
sible to select or breed strains of phal-
aris that do not develop the tryptamine
alkaloids.
Meanwhile, stock owners, cattle as
well as sheep, can lessen the risk by
keeping stock away from new-growth
phalaris, encouraging the proportion of
clover in the pasture, or by feeding out
cut and partially dried phalaris. Where
these alternatives are not possible they
can first test the safety of a pasture by
turning on to it a dozen or so head of
the less valuable stock.
Unearned Increment
lands need superphosphate.
Some also need zinc. Field trials
at Kojonup, 160 miles south-east of
Perth, indicate that commercial super-
phosphate is likely to contain enough
zinc as a contaminant to allow full
plant growth on zinc-deficient soils. The
super was applied at the rate of 2 cwt
per acre. This quantity of the particular
superphosphate was at least as effective
as the standard dressing of zinc sulphate
recommended for the area. It raised
clover yields by nearly one-third over
the yields obtained where a similar
amount of zinc-free super was applied,
The zinc contaminant comes mostly
from the parent phosphate rock. It is
fortunate that Australia gets its rock
from Nauru, Christmas and Ocean
Islands. Phosphatic rock from these
sources typically contains between 800
and 1000 parts of zinc per million. Phos-
phatic rock from some other parts of
the world, eastern USA for instance,
scarcely contains a trace of zinc. When
converted into the familiar superphos-
phate fertilisers, the zinc content ranges
f rom to P arts P er million. The
super used in the Kojonup trial contain-
ed 515 parts of zinc per million. A
point to remember, however, is that in-
cipient zinc deficiency could be masked
by the regular use of super. If such a
soil was then limed, plant growth would
be depressed since lime blocks the up-
take of zinc by plants. Even a very light
dressing of lime could have this effect.
Seminar on Farm Safety
Familiar machinery breeds contempt
A ustralian tractor and farm machin-
ery manufacturers and importers
are trying to get farmer organisations
interested in holding a national seminar
on farm safety. It is to be hoped that
the seminar is held and that all interested
parties attend.
Much good could come from such a
seminar. But relations between the
manufacturers and the safety experts are
not as good as they might be. Unless the
proposed seminar hears the views of
manufacturers, safety experts, and prac-
tical farmers, it could not really amount
to much.
A psychologist might be a worthy in-
clusion. One of the basic causes of
accidents on farms is the familiarity
which breeds contempt. How on earth
do you prevent yourself doing something
which you know to be dangerous but
which you have done time and time
again with impunity.
Attaching a rope or chain to a point
other than the proper one on the tractor
is a very common misuse which causes
accidents. It happens like this. The
tractor is rigged with an implement, say
a plough. Suddenly there is need to
haul something. A cow may have fallen
into a drain or a friend may have stalled
his car on a steep slope. So the farmer,
knowing full well that he shouldn’t do
it, hitches a rope to the plough sticking
out behind the tractor. Result the
tractor flips over and the farmer is
pinned underneath.
Children are another constant source
of trouble with tractors and farm
machinery generally. Everyone knows
the two do not mix. Yet the little fellow
is brought up in an atmosphere in which
the tractor is almost a part of the house-
hold. Do you give him a hiding every
time he goes near it?
A certain amount of parental pride
comes into it, too. The kid next door is
only ten, yet he is driving the tractor.
Do you encourage your boy to do the
same or do you put the fear of the devil
into him if he tries to start the tractor
by himself?
Talk of punitive legislation, which
would be justified, is not likely to help
much. Would any policeman feel like
charging a farmer for giving his young
child a ride in front of him on the
tractor?
Tractor safety, for country children,
is just as vital as road safety for city
children. All schools give training on
road safety and this is a good thing.
The seminar on farm safety might give
some thought to means of instructing
children in rural areas on basic rules of
farm machinery safety.


FINANCE CORPORATION
OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED
(Incorporated in South Australia)
MR R. S. TURNER
Chairman's Address at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders
held on Tuesday, 31st August, 1965
From the Directors’ Report
and the Balance Sheet as at
30th June, 1965, and support-
ing Accounts of the Company
and the Consolidated State-
ments of the F.C.A. Group,
Shareholders have already been
notified of the satisfactory
results achieved for the past
year. The Consolidated Net
Profit, after deducting Minority
Shareholders’ Interests, and
after providing tax at a basic
rate of 9/- in the £, was
£513,921.
The Federal Treasurer has
introduced his 1965 Budget
since the Company announced
its results, and the basic rate
of tax payable by Public Com-
panies remains unchanged at
8/6 in the £. In consequence
the tax provision of £468,194
will exceed the estimated tax
payable by £27,080.
The best index of the growth
in the Company’s earnings in
recent years is obtained by
comparing the results before
providing for tax or contingen-
cies.
The relevant figures are:—
1961/62 100
1962/63 139
1963/64 150
1964/65 185
Net Outstandings of the
Group i.e. after deducting
unearned income rose by
16.8% over the past year to
£34,321,156.
Hire Purchase Contracts
represent a very small, and
diminishing, part of the Group
business, and provide less than
3% of net outstandings, com-
pared with nearly 8% rep-
resented by Net Leasing Out-
standings, which have almost
doubled in the past year. Per-
sonal Loans (secured and
unsecured) are about 3%, and
outstandings from Real Estate
and Property Finance are
approximately 85% of the
total. We have concentrated
for several years on the latter
class of business, which we
consider the most satisfactory
available.
The substantial demand for
leasing facilities reflects the
widespread acceptance of leas-
ing of plant, machinery and
motor vehicles as a method of
finance in commerce and
industry.
Unearned Income included
in certain types of transactions
of the Grout) amounted to
£10,929,867, or 31.4% of the
relevant outstandings.
The growth of Group Net
Outstandings can be seen from
the following figures and
index:—
At 30th June:
£
1962 17.621,364 100
1963 24,029,193 136
1964 29,377,999 166
1965 34,321,156 194
The Contingency and Doubt-
ful Debts Reserve, which is not
reckoned as part of the Share-
holders’ Funds, but is deducted
from Outstandings in the Cur-
rent Assets, was increased by
£35,000 to £400,000 and
income tax has been paid or
provided in respect of this
sum. Your Directors consider
that the Reserve is adequate
for any losses which may here-
after arise in respect of
Debtors at 30th June, 1965.
Following our normal practice,
all bad debts incurred have
been written off in this year’s
accounts. Full provision was
made this year for any possible
loss that may be incurred in
respect of the investment by a
subsidiary company in shares
in Kosciusko Chalet Limited.
Despite keen competition,
there has been a satisfactory
volume of business available
throughout Australia, and out-
standings have grown, and are
substantial in all mainland
States. The progress made in
our newest Branch in Canberra
has justified our confidence in
opening there.
During the year your Direc-
tors decided not to continue
operations through the Com-
pany which had been incor-
porated in Malaysia, and our
shares were sold satisfactorily.
It is pleasing to report the
continued support of our
Debenture Issues throughout
Australia by individuals, institu-
tional investors and share-
brokers. Deposits also have
been maintained at a similar
level to last year. The Group’s
total borrowings of £32,462,121
at 30th June, 1965, consisted of
£22,981,400 from 12,709
Debenture Holders, £8,544,768
from 1,035 Depositors and
£935,953 secured loans in a
subsidiary company, Scottish
Loan Investment and Building
Society, in Perth, W.A.
On 25th June, 1965, the 22nd
Debenture Issue opened, and
the amount of the Issue,
£1.000,000, has already been
subscribed and oversubscrip-
tions are being accepted. In
this Issue there are four
medium terms offered —2, 4,
6 and 10 years—whilst for the
first time since 1961, short term
debentures are on offer, the
terms being 3,6, 9 and 12
months.
A high degree of liquidity
is being maintained as a firm
policy to ensure the Company’s
ability to repay all borrowed
moneys when due. At 30th
June, 1965, approximately £2.9
million was held in Bank
Balances, Commonwealth Gov-
ernment Stock, Deposits and
Shares quoted on Stock
Exchanges.
Paid up Capital at the last
balance date was £3,209,025,
and included the recent partly
paid issue of 1,000,000 10/-
Ordinary Shares on which 4/-
has been paid. The remaining
6/- per share will be payable
on Ist December, 1965.
Reserves and retained profits
total £1,265,992. All Reserves
are used in the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.
Stockholders and Sharehold-
ers now number 1,564, and for
the convenience of some, a
Branch Share Register was
opened in Canberra on 23rd
June, 1965.
The Company continues to
enjoy the active co-operation
and assistance of The Bank of
Adelaide our largest share-
holder, which owns 40% of the
issued Ordinary Capital.
It is fitting also that mention
be made of the valuable help
that the Company derives from
its membership, in common
with all other major Finance
Companies, in the Australian
Hire Purchase and Finance
Conference.
Since 30th June, 1965, our
Group of Companies has main-
tained a satisfactory volume of
business notwithstanding keen
competition in all States.
Competition for funds has
been accentuated by the wide-
spread tightness of liquidity,
and the number of substantial
fixed interest loans which have
been offered to the public by
industrial and commercial com-
panies in recent months.
The Directors who retire
by rotation this year are Sir
Barton Pope and Mr. R. S.
Turner. We are eligible for re-
election and offer ourselves
accordingly.
That the Company is once
again able to report records in
Net Profits earned, and in the
volume of Outstandings, reflects
very great credit on the Man-
agement, ably led by Mr. A. C.
Noble, our General Manager,
assisted by Mr. K. W. Adcock,
Mr. K. C. Collins and each
Branch Manager, as well as
the Staffs at Head Office and
each State. I know it is the
wish of the Members that I
should express their thanks, as
well as those of the Directors,
to all who have thus con-
tributed to the results of an-
other highly satisfactory year.

Chairman of Directors

A Home in the Country
Camden and diminishing returns
By RICHARD BURDEN
QYMPTOMATIC of the increasing Sydney shortage of land and housing, and con-
firmation of a prediction that Sydney has just about run out of suitable building
land, are advertisements proclaiming home sites in faraway Camden. For years a
sleepy village, and known mostly to interstate travellers as the last stop before the
hard driving began on the way to Melbourne, Camden is 38 miles from Sydney on
the Hume Highway.
By-passed by the main southern rail-
way line which goes through booming
Campbelltown eight miles away. Cam-
den has until recent times been notable
as a dairying and historical centre, not
as the scene of burgeoning housing
estates. Sleepy, comfortable and with a
number of buildings of architectural in-
terest (including St John’s Church,
1849, and nearby Brownlow Hill, a
superlative colonial country home), Cam-
den is the centre of a “civilised”, almost
British, countryside which was settled by
the Macarthur family as long ago as
1805.
Nearby areas are not so glamorous.
Picton, almost as long established as
Camden but farther south over a range
of hills, is “Australian” countryside and
is little removed other than in details
from a Russell Drysdale view of Sofala.
Campbelltown, too, undei the pressure
of a housing upsurge in the last few
years, has lost some of its charm.
Sprawling, bustling at midday, and with
most of the conveniences of a near-
Sydney suburb, it has the air of a scaled-
down Parramatta.
Campbelltown’s experience is the
price of progress. On the eastern side,
the houses first ciimbed up a pleasantly
settled hill until they dominated a whole
area. Now, on the western side, the
gouged and treeless hillside of the
sprawling Lend Lease development cf
Sherwood Hills is taking shape. In a
year, maybe a few years, this will take
on the contrived greenness of a garden
suburb. In the meantime, Campbelltown
will continue to have the air of a small
city in search of a future.
Camden, however, is not living as
easily with its future. So far great tracts
of land have not been carved up. Yet
there has been a steady erosion in re-
cent years of the larger estates in the
area. Mostly this has been in five-acre
lots, and has resulted in a fragmenta-
tion of the once rolling acres. It is not
as marked as a few miles north along-
side the Hume Highway near Lepping-
ton, but the signs are there.
The latest development is only a mile
south of Camden and consists of half-
acre and acre homesites, quaintly called
mini-farms although it is hard to
see economical farming of this sort of
land even on five acres. This is the Oak
Crest estate and its attraction is cheap-
ness. The full prices range from £495
and the deposit is a low £lO with “easy
terms”.
Presumably the disadvantages of Cam-
den also count in this low price, which
is advertised as £lOOO less than com-
parable home sites in Sydney. Never easy
to get to, and hence its great charm to
the wealthy who built in the area, Cam-
den has, with the demise of its famous
tramway to Campbelltown, become even
less accessible in the last few years.
Today it is car country. The company
developing the estate recognises this by
saying that the eight miles between Cam-
den and Campbelltown is a mere 10

minutes’ drive. Be this as it may, the
train ride from Campbelltown to Sydney
takes another 54 minutes. By car (and
at a realistic speed!) the whole trip from
Camden to Sydney takes about an hour
and a half, although traffic conditions
make this a variable figure.
Taking a shilling a mile as a reason-
able cost for operating a new car
such as a Holden (including deprecia-
tion), the 380 miles a week between
Camden and Sydney represent a for-
midable £l9. Public transport is cheaper,
but still works out at about £4 10s.
a week, the larger part of it being the
11s. Bd. a day return train fare from
Campbelltown to Sydney.
Qomewhere in the calculation, and be-
tween Campbelltown and Camden, the
point of diminishing returns has been
exceeded both in convenience and cost.
Most would class Campbelltown as an
okay place to live on the scores of
travelling time, access and expense; Cam-
den, attractive though the land may be
on terms of cost, may be just not worth
it. The mathematics of this situation has
probably spared Camden a fate similar
to that of Campbelltown, which is sub-
merging its identity in a drive to become
a satellite city with a population of
200,000.
This obsession has already brought a
remarkable change, with a certain ugli-
ness in housing co-existing with areas
which still retain an older charm.
Not that the cheap land at Camden
won’t be sold. There is at present not
a great deal of it, and the town offers
great recreational facilities to those con-
sidering retirement and to those wanting
to get away from it all. Although not
in this same area, Camden is still one
of the ideal places relatively near to
Sydney for a country home. Looking at
the shops in Camden’s main street, con-
servative and solid, and walking in its
dress circle among long-established
homes which rival those in Sydney’s bet-
ter suburbs, it is hard to believe that
any great change is likely.
This feeling becomes less strong on
seeing, close by, the newer houses which
are grafted on appendages to the main
part of the town. These conform to the
modern trend in low-cost housing, simple
and matter-of-fact. They have nothing
of the flamboyancy or eccentricity of
their older neighbors. Nor do they look
as if they will wear half so well.
Yet even these have the appearance
of belonging to the town rather than
being the sprawling overflow of Syd-
ney’s housing problem. Camden, too, is
growing. It might not be in the style to
which the old town is accustomed and
the developers might be eyeing its
charms. Perhaps a relatively quiet future
seems assured.

An Unrestored Dividend
Despite Petersville’s profit recovery
In line with chairman Christensen’s
statements to shareholders and the
Press during the year, Petersville Aus-
tralia scored a virtually complete recov-
ery during 1964-65. Profit rose from
£579,000 to £821,000 only £13,000
short of the record 1962-63 result. The
1963-64 setback was the result of stock
write-offs and the expense of moving to
new premises, among other things. Ap-
parently the successful integration of the
general foods division played a large
part in the latest recovery.
In actual fact, the recovery is more
than complete and not just short of the
mark, as the figures indicate. Profit was
after depreciation of £786,000; in 1962-
63 this item took only £584,000. It was
also after tax at £513,000; in 1962-63
the provision absorbed only £414,000.
So, although net results are still frac-
tionally behind their former self, the
group’s overall position is actually far
improved on 1962-63. This is a bright
state of affairs, especially when one con-
siders that profits from ice-cream were
adversely affected by unfavorable sea-
sonal conditions dtiring the year.
Unfortunately, the dividend will not
be restored. Following the 1963-64 slide
in earning rate from 18.7 to 12.9 p.c.,
the 10-year-old 15 p.c. payout was cut
to 121 p.c. Shareholders have been under
the impression that 15 p.c. payments
would resume after the profit recovery.
Apparently this is not to be the case:
the payout will stay at 121 p.c. although
earning rate is now up to 18.2 p.c.
It is to be hoped that directors see
fit to restore the rate in the current year.
No doubt there will be some nasty
queries at the annual meeting as it is,
seeing the chairman himself had expressed
the hope of a restoration at a Press con-
ference last year. Perhaps the board is
awaiting better results from the ice-cream
division before restoring the dividend.
The current year will tell.

sound industrials and devoid of
speculative elements, the large flotation
of Consolidated Rutile Ltd is a bold
move.
Shares offered for subscription are

The shares will be attractive to ' big
tax-payers, as one-third of calls on Aus-
tralian mining shares are tax deductible,
and one-fifth of company, income is tax-
free. Dividends paid from this exempt
income are tax-free in shareholders’
hands.

ing and wet treatment plants for rutile
and zircon, at a cost of £l} million.
Expected annual production is 30,000
tons of rutile and 25,000 tons of zir-
con; by relating all operating costs to
rutile, production value is assessed at
£26 11s. Od. per ton. Recent forward
prices for rutile were £4O per ton, and
for zircon, which is mined for free on
this costing basis, £25 per ton. Inciden-
tal production is 60,000 tons of ilmenite,
which will be stockpiled.
Consolidated Rutile has contracts for
sale of 30 p.c. of planned production ; n
the next three years, worth an estimated
£1,450,000.
London reports say that rutile pro-
ducers “generally appear to be very well
sold ahead, while merchants’ supplies
are believed to be none too flush either”.
Zircon is holding well despite a doubling
of prices in the past year. One leading
producer is believed to be selling well
below this level to avoid risk of sub-
stitution, the report states.
Industrious Engineering
Shareholders’ concern over the future
dividends of Melbourne-based In-
dustrial Engineering has now been well
and truly put aside. Profit in the year to
June 30 rose 80 p.c. from £247,000 to
a record £445,000, equalling 22.3 p.c.
on steady ordinary capital. Dividend for
the year will be held at 10 p.c. Shares
from the one-for-eight issue made in
April do not rank for the payout.
At the time of the issue, shareholders
still had the 1963-64 result at the back
of their minds. It equalled only 12.5 p.c.
on capital, so the prospects of main-
taining 10 p.c. dividends after the issue
were rather small. Fortunately such is
no longer the case.
Moreover, the current year looks ex-
tremely promising. The subsidiaries and
associate companies already have enough
orders on hand to occupy themselves
with for the rest of the year. A plan
for the streamlining of administration
is to be implemented. This, one pre-
sumes, will lower overheads. Certain
aspects of the product range are to be
expanded. It w'ould not be surprising if
the year closed with a higher dividend
for shareholders. Alternatively, the ex-
panding business may require cash,
which could well be financed by another
issue.

December half, expected benefits from
the deal with Yarra Falls, the Bruce
Pie takeover, an extra three months trad-
ing by the New Zealand subsidiary and
numerous other items could all have
been expected to improve the result,
but no.
Profit came back below that formid-
able £1 million mark to £987,807. This
was the second successive fall from the
peak £1,100,000 earned in 1962-63,
Earning rate on capital increased by the
Bruce Pie takeover eased from 15.6 to
14.3 p.c., though still provided adequate
cover for the steady 10 p.c. dividend.
Directors gave no explanation for the
situation in their otherwise comprehen-
sive preliminary report. One hopes the
annual report will shed a little light in
the necessary quarters. Shareholders are
no doubt becoming somewhat concerned
at the profit trend and wish to get some
idea of how much longer it is likely to
continue. After all, any further lower-
ings could prove dangerous to dividends
in the future, especially as the group
has yet to bear a full year’s interest on
the £5 million in 7 p.c debentures it
floated off a few months ago.
To maintain the position it holds in
the industry the group must expand as
it has done in the past year. This in-
volves cash. If the difference between
earnings and the dividend becomes too
narrow, this cash may only be found
by cutting the dividend. Further borrow-
ings seem out of the question at the
moment. An upturn in profits is vital
in the current year
Rueful Reid
A lthough directors had already pre-
dieted a heavy loss for the year,
£312,000 was a little heavier than the
shareholders in G. H. Reid expected—
especially when one adds to this figure
the additional £BO,OOO provided for fur-
ther losses in the current year.
The extra amount will supposedly
cover all further losses on stage one of
the US Navy project on the North West
Cape, WA. As far as stage two is con-
cerned, directors are confident that pro-
fits will result. How much store to put
in their confidence is purely a personal
matter, seeing any unbiased opinion is
lacking.
Moreover, the future is never easy
to predict, especially for contractors. A
few facts and figures from the directors
would be appreciated. If these are not
forthcoming in the annual report or at
the yearly meeting on October 29, a few
more shareholders will be playing safe by
selling out and cutting their losses.
Fortunately, the loss has not pounded
too hard a blow at the group’s finances.

These businessmen aren’t fickle.
They just approach costs with a needle-sharp pencil.
So when they punch a hole in inflated office copying costs, the copier they
loved and chose in May usually becomes a Bruning 2000 in December.
Reasons:
The Bruning 2000 produces sharp, top-quality copies for as little as 3.5 pence
each (including materials and depreciation for volume purchasers). Lowest
cost per copy among dry copiers.
Copies range from cheque size to 11 inches, by any reasonable length ledger
or even roll.
It spins these copies out at 14 per minute. Because it’s the fastest copier, the
office help spends less time standing around waiting for copies.
And, depending on your needs, you can rent, buy or lease a Bruning 2000.

The result did not include a £121,000
profit from the sale of the 50 p.c. interest
in Monier-Reid Asphalt Pty. Ltd. The
losses will lower tax commitments once
profits are restored. In addition, the
group still managed to find £175,000
during the year to pay off a mortgage
loan. The stage is set for a brighter
future, but it all depends on contracts,
dangerous documents at any time.
Exceptional Year
fpHE great success of the NSW smelter,
A refiner and manufacturer O. T.
Lempriere and Co. Ltd for the year to
June was helped by the wide fluctuations
in tin, lead, antimony and copper prices.
Directors regarded the net result of
£194,314 as exceptional (1963-64’s
profit was £127,715), so they appropri-
ated £60,000 for metal price fluctuation
reserve, bringing that account to the
significant sum of £200,000.
Turnover, partly reflecting higher
metal prices, jumped 52 p.c.
Earning rate rose from 9.5 p.c. in
1962-63 and 21.3 p.c. the next year to
29.1 p.c. A 21 p.c. bonus was added
to the 10 p.c. basic dividend, though
the new shares created by the one-for-
six par issue in April last do not par-
ticipate in the final pay-out.
Lempriere should be an interesting
stock to watch. The ss. shares are cur-
rently three times par to yield 4.1 p.c.
in income and 9.7 p.c. in earnings.
Losing Less
Queensland beef road contracts
have involved McDonald Industries
Ltd, civil engineer and builder, in
losses totalling £670,000.
In a preliminary profit announcement,
directors reported that £280,000 of this
relates to the latest trading period to
June 30.
The remainder of the business, there-
fore, made a profit of about £200,000,
since the group’s net result is a loss of
£80,709. This follows the 1963-64 trad-
ing loss of £431,252, of which we now
know £350,000 was due to the roads
contracts and the" balance to losses on
another Queensland contract and a
couple of contracts in NSW.
In 1964 an interim 5 p.c. dividend
was paid before the difficulties of the
beef roads contracts were realised; this
was the total distribution for the year.
No dividend is recommended for the
year under review.
Capital profits of £145,112 (1964,
£17,683) were a redeeming feature in
the latest news release, as was the state-

ment that contracts in hand total £9m.
and trading is now on a profitable basis.
Cyclonic conditions upset estimates
for the Queensland roads. Labor and
machinery shortages and isolation also
played their part in 1963-64. The cy-
clones continued into February-March,
1965.
The company has not allowed for
the success of any claims in respect of
the roads contracts.
The ss. shares remain well below par
at 3s. 7d., yet another reminder that
no matter how good the past record,
all contractors are liable to make mis-
takes of such a magnitude as to severely
strain their liquidity and invesors’ loyalty.
Hiltons Efficiency
T ast week’s result from the Hilton
hosiery and lingerie group, while
not remarkable for any great growth of
business during the year, indicated an
encouraging trend toward greater ef-
ficiency always a valuable asset in
any branch of the rag trade. Profit rose
by 13 p.c. although sales rose by only
5 p.c. This is a substantial improvement
on 1963-64, when the 1\ p.c. profit rise
followed a 13 p.c. rise in sales.
The achievement is made more out-
standing when one considers that the
profit rise was despite increased operat-
ing costs. The result, up from £234,000
to £265,000, equals a healthy 24.6 p.c.
on capital. The improvement prompted
directors to raise the dividend from 131
to 15 p.c.
They are well justified in raising the
payout, although the actual profit im-
provement was only about £31,000. It
was the best result since 1957-58. Earn-
ing rate was the best since the 31 p.c.
earned in 1959-60, before the credit
squeeze.
Appropriate or Provide
TV/larket observers can take about three
different views of trading by the
Bellambi Coal Company Ltd.
The company itself, in its preliminary
report, declared a profit improvement
from £67,534 to £95,547, after pro-
vision for major overhauls and replace-
ments of £84,000 (1964, £60,972) and
provision for deferred tax of £92,777
(1964, £52,908).
But in the 1964 published accounts
Bellambi treated deferred tax as an ap-
propriation after bringing down a profit
of £120,442, for which the comparable
figure in the latest June period is
£188,324.
The current tax provision was a nom-
inal £16,803 (1964, £13,240). The or-
dinary shareholder might appreciate
some explanation of the deferred tax.
Depreciation provided was £277,439,
compared with the previous year’s
£207,349.
If the deferred tax is accepted as an
appropriation and not a provision, the
earning rate rose from 21.5 to 33,7
p.c. The question of deferred tax did not
arise in preceding years. The earning
rate in 1962-63 was a modest 14.5 p.c.
Taking the most conservative view of the
latest results, the earning rate is 17.1
p.c.
A 10 p.c. ordinary dividend is paid
for the ninth year in a row, of which
two-thirds goes to Consolidated Gold-
fields (Aust.) Pty.
This control accounts for the low 2.1
p.c. yield on the ss. shares currently sel-
ling for about 245.


CUSTOM CREDIT CORPORATION LIMITED
CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS, 1965
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING, held on Tuesday, 31st August, 1965
Ladies and Gentlemen:
As the Directors’ Report and Profit
and Loss Account for the year ended
30th June, 1965, and the Balance Sheet
as at that date have been printed and
circulated, I presume it is your wish
that they be taken as read.
There are some aspects of the con-
solidated accounts to which I would like
to draw your attention.
It will be noted that our total assets
increased by £1,120,498, the primary
reason being an increase of £1,559,287
in overall outstandings which, at bal-
ancing date, totalled £84,372,807. How-
ever, during the period under review,
substantial prepayments of long term
loans continued and this accounts, in
the main, for the reduction of £419,065
in Income Yet* to Mature, which now
totals £12,667,806. Other than these, the
movements in asset items do not have
any special significance.
On the liabilities side it will be noted
that the total of Debentures and Notes
outstanding amounted to £58,548,159,
compared with £59,380,233 last year, a
reduction of £832,074. This movement,
during a period of consolidation, suit-
ed us quite well, ,nd, from the viewpoint
of cash funds, was offset by the intake
of £1 million of Preference Capital, of
which shareholders are already aware,
and £675,000 representing the net cash
proceeds from the sale of Customlife
Assurance Limited, to which I shall
refer later.
Shareholders will, I feel sure, be in-
terested in the fact that of the total
amounts payable by Custom Credit Cor-
poration Limited in respect of Deben-
tures, Notes and all other liabilities,
amounts due to mature within two
years are estimated at £36,533,834,
which includes approximately £5,000,000
more or less permanently on deposit by
our own subsidiary companies. Tra-
ditionally, a high proportion of our
maturing Debentures and Notes is re-
newed for further periods. It is import-
ant to realise that during the same peri-
od of two years, Gross Receivables are
estimated at £59,816,596. There will, of
course, be an intake of funds from new
subscriptions for Debentures and Notes
under prospectuses we will issue from
time to time. Consequently, you will see
that our funds are in excellent balance.
Having dealt with the major move-
ments in our assets and liabilities, I
now turn to the results of the year’s
trading. The consolidated net profit was
£1,193,078 after providing for Income
Tax of £926,199. This compares with
£1,109,924 after Income Tax £890,650
for the previous year. The profit for
the year is equivalent to 16.6% on Or-
dinary Capital and represents an in-
crease of 15.8% over the year ended
30th June, 1964, when the figures for
that year are adjusted to a comparable
basis.
Your Board feels, having regard to
the conditions in the' industry over the
past year, that this result is satisfactory.
At the same time, it is also felt that,
in the present economic climate, it
would be prudent to husband the Com-
pany’s funds by a strengthening of re-
serves and, therefore, a final dividend
of 3 pence per Ordinary Stock Unit
has been recommended which, with the
interim dividend of a similar amount
paid on 22nd March, 1965, represents
10% on Ordinary Capital for the year.
From the year’s profit, we have al-
located £250,000 to strengthen further
the Provision for Doubtful Debts. Per-
haps I should stress that all bad debts
are written off as they occur, conse-
quently this provision is not called upon
and stood on balance date at £753,326.
In addition, the Capital Reserve bene-
fited by £225,000 as the result of the
sale of Customlife Assurance Limited.
Your Board, after most careful con-
sideration and in the light of experience
gained during the seven years’ opera-
tion of Customlife Assurance Limited,
decided that the funds invested there-
in could be employed to greater advan-
tage in our main undertaking. Follow-
ing somewhat lengthy negotiations a
sale was effected, on a basis satisfactory
to all concerned. The amount paid by
the purchasers was £1,225,000, plus a
dividend of £50,000, making the total
cash received £1,275,000, leaving a net
cash result of £675,000 after the pay-
ing out by Custom Credit Corporation
Limited of £600,000, which had been
invested in that Company by Custom-
life Assurance Limited.
Our main subsidiary Company,
National & General Insurance Com-
pany Limited, enjoyed a record pre-
mium income for the year of £5,816,705,
compared with £5,529,432 for the year
to 30th June, 1964, an increase of
£287,273. Net Profit after tax was
£106,076, compared with £104,692 for
the previous fifteen months, and the
result is regarded as very satisfactory.
Shareholders are aware that this
Company is managed and operates in-
dependently from the parent company
and exercises its right of accepting busi-
ness with consequent responsibility.
Notwithstanding this, it forms part of
our complete operation, and this valu-
able asset will always remain as an in-
tegral part of our business.
This year we incorporated in the
United Kingdom a wholly owned sub-
sidiary, National & General Insurance
Company (United Kingdom) Limited,
and it is intended, in due course, that
all business transacted in this area will
be handled by that company.
During the year under review, Cus-
tom Credit Corporation Limited pursu-
ed a policy of conservative expansion,
concentrating on short term business of
good quality. Eight new branches were
opened to handle personal finance and
insurance in city, metropolitan and
country centres. Increased motor
vehicle hire purchase business continu-
ed with carefully selected acceptances,
but during the past year this avenue
constituted a somewhat lesser propor-
tion of the total business than previous-
ly.
Your Directors record their apprecia-
tion of the continued close co-operation
by The National Bank of Australasia
Limited, and the valued service by its
714 branches throughout Australia and
the United Kingdom. During the cur-
rent financial year, all of our branches
were appointed Agents for The Nation-
al Bank Savings Bank Limited for the
purpose of opening new accounts and
transacting normal savings bank busi-
ness.
We are particularly grateful to the
Investing Public and Members of the
Stock Exchanges, in all States, for their
continued support throughout the year
to our Debenture Stock and Unsecured
Notes issues.
We congratulate Mr. E. A. Edwards,
our Chief General Manager, on being
elected Federal Chairman of the Aus-
tralian Hire Purchase and Finance Con-
ference; also our New South Wales
Manager, Mr. R. Williams, Past Chair-
man of the Conference for New South
Wales, and our Queensland Manager,
Mr. K. Athans, Chairman of the Con-
ference for Queensland. We believe these
appointments are an appreciation of
the esteem and standing that our ex-
ecutives hold in the finance industry.
The Conference has been doing excel-
lent work in developing closer co-opera-
tion between the industry and Govern-
ments and in fostering greater under-
standing of the working of consumer
credit. Of particular interest, is the at-
tention being devoted to improving the
industry’s statistical service, with the
object of keeping both Conference mem-
bers and authorities outside the indus-
try more closely informed on trends in
consumer credit and other forms of
financing.
The Directors record their apprecia-
tion of the splendid achievements, en-
terprise, and the loyal work of the
Managers, Executives and Staff of the
Corporation and associated Companies
throughout the year.

Chairman.

Little Enthusiasm for Financiers
Yet Alliance Holdings possesses real merits
A lliance holdings limited is yet
another example of the lack of in-
vestors’enthusiasm for finance companies
today, despite the good results which are
currently being announced by the maj-
ority of such companies. At 7s. the divi-
dend yield from Alliance s shares is in
excess of 7 p.c. and the 10 p.c. dividend,
even on the increased capital of
£2,250,000, vv.ll.be covered 1.7 times by
last year's earnings. Over the last five
years, earnings have always been sutti-
, .
cient to cover this dividend commitment.
„ , _
Earnings for the year 1964-65 were
55 p.c. greater than those for the year
1960-61; there has been a steady in-
crease each year. From many points of
vic* this would be an attractive record.
T ~ ... , u .
It would certainly seem that the com-
, , . ,
pany deserves a higher rating on the
stock market than it is currently receiv-
stock market than it currently receiv
m °‘ .
It is now seven years since the Mutual
Life and Citizens Assurance Company
Limited first acquired a 44i p.c. interest
in the company, just two years after Al-
liance Holdings had been formed to
merge the interests of Alliance Accept-
ance Co. and Portadown Discounts. The
histories of these two companies prior
to the merger seem to have been com-
parable with those of other finance com-
panies formed just after the end of
World War 11. Actually Portadown Dis-
counts had been formed prior to the
War, in 1938, but it was not converted
to a public listed company until 1951.
At that time, its activities covered motor
vehicle finance, industrial finance and
business finance, mainly in the Newcastle
area. Alliance Acceptance was incorpor-
ated j n 1950, a } so to conduc t hire-pur-
chase business (he automotive and in .

1954-55. Portadown also more than
~ . . ,
doubled its profits in the same period,
, c . r
However, after he merger, profits seem
tQ haye declined Qnly in the 1959.60
year was the consolidated profit as high
as {he combined profit of Alliance Ac-
ceptance and Portadown Discounts in
1954-55. Even the £1 million subscribed
by tbe Mutual Life and Citizens’ did
nothing to alleviate the position. The 15
p c dividend rate was cut to 121 p.c.
| n 1960-61 and to 10 p.c. in 1961-62.
This latter rate has easily been main-
tained since that time; in fact there
would seem to be some scope now for
a return to the 121 p.c. rate at least.
It will be obvious that growth in net
outstandings and other debtors, etc., has
been the main reason for this improve-
ment in earnings. As at June 30, 1961,
the total amount of these accounts was
£12.8 million approximately, but in four
years this figure had been increased to
£25.7 million almost precisely double.
So far as can be judged from the fairly
brief comments made annually in the
directors’ report, a fair part of this in-
crease has taken the form of property
mortgages, bridging finance and other
types of secured lending. During the last
eighteen months, it would seem that the
whole of the increase in the funds avail-
able has been directed towards this type
of financing, for in both the half-yearly
report and the preliminary final report
it was stated that hire-purchase funds
had remained steady during the preced-
ing twelve months and the increase in
gross receivables came from the em-
ployment of funds in this area.
Until such time as the full accounts
are available and the amount paid in
interest for the year is known, it will
be difficult to make any appraisal of the
profitability of this move. It is quite
likely that this type of business is rela-
tively more profitable than hire-purchase
business. The main problem is the selec-
tion of risk and making certain that an
unduly high proportion of the funds is
not committed to any one venture or to
any one borrower. Over the last three
years, the rate of return on average out-
standings has been approximately as
follows:

debtors, etc. 8.3 7.8 7.9 (8.3) estimate
The average cost of borrowing seems
to have declined sharply in 1963-64, but
I would expect to find that the average
interest rate over the last three years
of 6.9 p.c. has not varied to any extent
when the 1964-65 figures are available.
However, it is clear that the gearing of
the company has increased quite sub-
stantially over the last five years, for
while net outstandings have doubled,
borrowings have increased by 133 p.c.
The trust deed for the unsecured note-
holders limits “borrowings” to 80 p.c.
of “liquid assets” and the definition of
“liquid assets” includes the provision for
unearned income. On the basis of the
figures appearing on page 10 of the last
prospectus, it would seem that, very
roughly, the company could borrow up

to 921 p.c. of total tangible assets or
total liabilities could be at least 12 times
shareholders’ funds.
The ratio of total liabilities to net
shareholders’ funds over the last four
years has been as follows:—
Dec. 31
As at June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1964
3.76 4.01 4.52 6.05 6.90
These figures indicate that there will
be no need, so far as the terms of the
trust deed are concerned, to raise fur-
ther equity capital for some time to
come. Equally, there is no real need to
plough back profits to boost the share-
holders’ funds. However, it is quite pos-
sible that the company would not run
liabilities to anywhere near the limits
available by the trust deed and could
well feel that once an 8-to-l situation
has been reached, further shareholders’
capital should be raised. Even so, this
would allow a further £4 million to be
borrowed. Assuming that the average
cost of borrowing remains around the
present level and there is no change in
the average return on funds, the earning
rate on the present capital could be rais-
ed to just over 18 p.c. by this increase
in the borrowings.
At the rate borrowings have been in-
creasing over the last two years, it could
have been expected that a further £4
million would have been borrowed dur-
ing 1965-66, but there are already in-
dications that next year will be a diffi-
cult one for the “money-raisers”. This
could mean that the increase in funds
will not proceed so rapidly.
With the prospect of some improve-
ment in the dividend rate, and perhaps
a new issue to shareholders also pos-
sible, the shares seem quite attractive
at present prices.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Rather Languishing Prospect
Lamson Industries does not excite
T amson industries \USTRALIA LTD
operates from Melbourne through
three main subsidiaries: Lamson Para-
gon Ltd, which specialises in business
forms, systems products and ancillaries;
Control Systems (A’asia) Pty Ltd, which
handles accounting and office machines,
ticket-issuing equipment and totalisator
equipment, and Lamson Engineering
Australia Pty Ltd, dealing in pneumatic
document-carrying systems, conveyors
and internal telephone and address sys-
tems.
The main subsidiaries all have plants,
branches and sales coverage throughout
Australia and New Zealand. The origin-
al company was registered in Victoria
in 1897 and the name was changed to
Lamson Paragon Ltd in July, 1910. A
holding company was formed in July,
1957,, and a new holding company in
July, 1962 In total today there are 21
subsidiaries, incorporated *in Victoria
(5), NSW (8), Queensland (1), SA (1),
WA (2), ACT (1), Tasmania (1) and New
Zealand (2).
There is a history of mediocre earn-
ing rates and dividends ever since the
formation of the first holding company,
Lamson Paragon Industries Ltd. In 1950-
51 a one-for-five bonus issue was made
to shareholders The following year a
one-for-two issue of 20s shares was
made at an Bs. premium. In the two
years prior to 1956-57, earning rates
were at the peak levels of more than
20 p.c. and dividends were I2i p.c.
The formation of the holding company
brought the earning rate to 10.5 p.c.
in 1956-57 and the dividend to 9 p.c.
it has yet to top this rate. To balance
against this weakened position was the
virtual one-for-two bonus which share-
holders received in accepting the take-
over offer from the holding company
Two years after this holding company
had achieved its peak level of earnings
and dividend 16.3 and 9 p.c. re-
spectively another holding company
was formed, Lamson Industries Aus-
tralia Ltd. Amid great controversy, need-
less to say! The deal for shareholders
was not as good this time but, con-
versely, their capital was not watered to
nearly the same extent. They were of-
fered two 10s. shares plus 20s. cash for
every three 10s. shares they were al-
ready holding.
This move should have enhanced
earning rates considerably, as capital
would have been reduced by a third.
However, shareholders were not the only
ones to be issued shares in the new
company. To finance the cash portion of
the deal and to execute a merger with
the local subsidiaries of Lamson of the
UK, shares totalling more than 50 p.c.
of the new holding company’s capital
were issued to the English group. The
end effect was to almost double paid
capital from £1,419,000 to the present
£2,686,000. Subsidiaries acquired were
Lamson Engineering and Control Sys-
tems, two of the most important in the
group today. As the accompanying table
shows, profits have been much higher
ever since but, unfortunately, earning
rates have been more mediocre than ever.
Although it would seem that the
whole 1961-62 deal was not very bene-

ficial to shareholders, many experts are
of the opinion that it saved them from
a very bad or perhaps disastrous few
years. In 1960-61 the 9 p.c. dividend
was covered by 13.3 p.c. earnings. How-
ever, a note conversion was on the way
which would have lifted capital by 50
p.c. Obviously the 9 p.c. dividend could
not have been maintained after this capi-
tal increase unless profits managed to
rise considerably. The noteholders re-
ceived the same offer from the holding
company on conversion as did the share-
holders and the whole deal solved the
problem of the conversion very neatly.
Earning rates since the new company’s
formation are shown in the accompany-
ing table a peak of 12 p.c. was reach-
ed in the year to December 31 last.
Dividends have been 9 p.c. without a
miss, the same rate paid by the old hold-
ing company in its last two years. The
table also shows that, despite the lower
calibre of the stock since 1961-62, share
prices have actually fluctuated on a high-
er plane. More than anything, this would
seem to reflect the more stable nature
of the group now that it is virtually
controlled by the powerful English com-
pany.
The outlook for earnings in the cur-
rent year is a little puzzling, despite the
extra business which must be coming
the company’s way as a result of the
switch to decimal currency. In the six
months to June profit was down 6 p.c.,
although sales were up by 13 p.c. Dir-
ectors attributed the decline to the de-
creased profitability of business forms
caused by the abnormally heavy costs
associated with the reorganisation of pro-
duction at the various factories. As the
changes have been completed, similar
costs should not be encountered in the
current last half. In addition, the direc-
tors have indicated that sales are now
running 15 p.c. ahead of last year. The
company has paid a steady interim divi-
dend of 3 p.c.
So it seems that investors can expect
another year of mediocre earnings and
another 9 p.c. dividend, providing no
other abnormal costs arise. Next year,
of course, should see a worthwhile im-
'provement if sales continue to rise and
the benefits of the new currency make
themselves more definitely apparent.
The table shows a steady and appar-
ently adequate amount of working capi-
tal since the formation of the new hold-
ing company. The 1962 column covers
a 14-month period, when the balance
date of the group was changed to De-
cember 31. Fixed assets show little ex-
pansion since that year, while intan-
gibles are substantially lower than those
which the former company carried in
its books. Reserves, in relation to capi-
tal, are nothing to write home about,
while the relatively low level of loan

capital offers prospect for any expan-
sionary cash which may be needed; the
low earnings make it inadvisable to raise
any from shareholders.
Profits have varied over a narrow
range since 1962, apparently depending
to a large extent on how well directors
can control the cost of operation. The
shortage of skilled labor has created
problems with many of the group’s high-
ly technical products. Thus, costs of
mechanisation must be borne.
To sum up: at 21s. and yielding 4.3
p.c. from the dividend, the shares offer
little but the possibility of making capi-
tal out of the switch '"o decimal cur-
rency. However, as the group’s resources
are already fairly hard pushed, it is
doubtful whether profits will rise to any
great extent. If they do, slightly high-
er dividends are a more likely occur-
rence than a share issue. It must be re-
membered that the benefits of the cur-
rency switch are unlikely to last beyond
the end of 1967. Generally, a lot of
ifs and buts can be seen in the future,
although, undoubtedly, the group’s posi-
tion is unlikely to get any worse. It
would seem that there are plenty of more
attractive companies to sink pounds (or
dollars) into.

BROKEN HILL HOLDINGS LTD
Getting Out of the Cold
A more or less full trading recovery
was made by Broken Hill Holdings
Ltd in the June 1965 year after a
previous year of severe industrial unrest
in the city of Broken Hill.
The company now has published five
years’ reports. It was formed in April,
1961, to co-ordinate the activities of four
independent local companies with board
links and became the first commercial
public company formed in Broken Hill
to obtain Stock Exchange listing (on
both Sydney and Adelaide Exchanges).
Those four companies ran two first-
class hotels, the largest bakery in the
city, a drive-in theatre, and a finance
business. The latter ran into collection
difficulties and wisely ceased lending
operations; it is now solely “the finance
arm of the group”. The hotel subsidiary
added the Freemasons Hotel to the
Palace and Royal Exchange Hotels, so
that the group now offers about four-
fifths of the city’s better accommodation.
The Freemasons and Palace Hotels
are freeholds, but the Royal Exchange
is leased from the South Australian
Brewing Company. All three have been
renovated and modernised at consider-
able expense.
In 1961-62 the group acquired the
only commercial laundry in Broken Hill,
and a new subsidiary, Holdings Suppliers
Pty, obtained the agency for Penfolds
wines, Black and White whisky and
other lines. It now operates as pur-
chasing agent for the group.
The most daring move by the group
was the flotation of Kosciusko Chalet
Ltd which runs The Chalet at Charlotte’s
Pass in the Snowy Mountains. Broken
Hill Holdings had intended to form a
subsidiary to conduct The Chalet, but
decided the capital needed for extensions
and erection of a chairlift was beyond
its own resources.
Kosciusko Chalet Ltd was therefore
floated off as a separate venture. Broken
Hill Holdings subscribed £50,000 of the
paid-up capital, which was £150,000
after public subscriptions were invited.
Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd
(with Bank of Adelaide connections)
lent £200,000 under floating charge and
mortgage, at 12 p.c.
The Chalet company had trouble from
the start with the chairlift, to which so
much of its capital was committed. It
lost £171,725 in the 14 months to Febru-
ary 28, 1965, after losing £10,812 in
the preceding year. The rate of loss in
the period to February was expected to
continue until the snow season began in
July.
In December last a capital and
managerial reconstruction was made
by Kosciusko. FCA, which was owed
£475,000 in advances, then assumed
managerial control, reduced the interest
on its loans to 7 p.c., converted £200,000
of its debenture loan into preferred
ordinary shares, and made various other
financial rearrangements.

CONSOLIDATED MILK INDUSTRIES LTD.
1965 ANNUAL MEETING
The chairman, Mr. A. E. McCartney, addressed shareholders at the 45th
annual meeting of the company at Federation House, Phillip St., Sydney, on
Tuesday, August 31, 1965.
Mr. McCartney said:
Ladies and Gentlemen,
With the Members' consent I am taking the
Accounts and Reports now before the Meeting
as having been read, but before moving their
adoption I shall avail myself of the oppor-
tunity of commenting thereon.
The Directors' Report concisely covers the
financial statements and does not require
elaboration, but there are other factors which
influence operations.
As you are aware, this Company has con-
siderable capital invested in the Dairying In-
dustry and is vitally concerned with its pro-
gress.
During the period reviewed New South
Wales experienced extreme drought conditions
which adversely affected all primary produc-
tion.
The area from the Hunter to the Richmond
Rivers, where dairying predominates, suffered
unprecedented hardships and the Company's
condenseries at Taree and Grafton were
obliged to ration export sales to maintain home
consumption.
The contingent liability referred to in the
Directors' Report relates to Drought Relief dis-
tributed amongst those producers supplying
the Company's Dairy plants which since the
balancing date is in the vicinity of £lOO,OOO.
In the event of adequate rainfall being re-
ceived in the affected areas, the forthcoming
season's production is assured of a ready out-
let.
Economic operation
In view of the foregoing the results achieved
from the fluid and processed milk operations
were most satisfactory, principally due to eco-
nomic plant operation.
For some years past considerable sums have
been spent on plant and equipment at Taree,
Grafton and the Fresh Food & Ice Company,
the benefit of which has shown to advantage
this season.
Although export quantities were curtailed,
there was a corresponding advance in sales
values which considerably maintained earn-
ings.
The Cold Storage Company operated at full
capacity as the drop in Butter production was
more than maintained by Meat exports.
In New South Wales, Ice Cream production
rose by 11.26%, which our Companies shared
to an increased advantage. Competition has
become more intense mainly through the ad-
vent of new companies, together with the in-
vasion by Victorian Companies at cut prices.
The South Australian Company continues to
maintain satisfactory progress and its estab-
lishment has proved well worthwhile.
The Nizer Refrigeration Company has had
to extend its activities to maintain the increas-
ing demand for Farm Refrigeration which will
absorb its output for many years to come.
Milk exports helped
The association with Foremost Dairies, Inc.,
has proved to advantage, particularly in re-
spect to the development of export markets
where the Company's products have now be-
come well established, which has increased
the demand for fluid milk at the condenseries.
Again it is my pleasure to emphasise the
loyalty and efficiency of the Executive and
Staff which has contributed to the results
achieved.
In conclusion, the financial results are credit-
able, especially in view of the abnormal sea-
sonal conditions and the limitation of export
sales.
I now move the adoption of the Accounts and
Reports as submitted.

issued £50,000 71 p.c. cumulative re-
deemable preference shares to the Mutual
Life and Citizens’ Assurance Co Ltd.
The proceeds were wholly used to take
up £50,000 of 71 p.c. cumulative re-
deemable preference shares in the
Kosciusko venture.
These were converted to preferred
ordinary shares at the time of the
Kosciusko reconstruction. As a con-
dition of the FCA moves, Broken Hill
Holdings was obliged to contribute a
further £25,000 for preferred ordinary
shares. Its investment is now con-
solidated in £50,000 of preferred ordin-
aries and £75,000 in ordinaries.
As an appropriation of profits for
1964-65, Broken Hill placed £50,000 in
a reserve for the Kosciusko investment.
The new Kosciusko management has
made it clear that it is a long-term
venture. Holders of ordinary shares
cannot expect any dividend for at least
five years.
In five years the company has earned
£233,398 in profits and paid out
£162,522 in dividends. Unfortunately
the ordinary shareholders are rather less
well off than they were at the beginning
of that period. Preference capital has
been issued to rank ahead of them. The
latest earning rate of 12.5 p.c. and
dividend of 8 p.c. are retreats from the
1961 levels of 14.7 p.c. and 10 p.c.
respectively. The 5s. shares are now
down to 3s. 6d., although this is some
recovery from last year’s low.
A fairly tight working capital position
is evident, intangible assets have not
diminished, and the group is saddled with
the Kosciusko investment, presently un-
productive. But perhaps the manage-
ment has profited by five years in the
public investment field, so conservative
progress may now be made.
The management can be complimented
on its reporting of group activities from
instigation of the company.

Odd Interpretations of Facts
Sorting out the company reports
EVERY day we are greeted with a welter of company reports. In most instances
they cover three items profit, tax and dividend rate. It’s amazing how these
three can be twisted around so as to present a different story every time. Take Olims,
for example,
One report highlighted the fact that
more tax was paid this year than last
and then, almost as an afterthought,
mentioned that earning rate was down
from 32 p.c. to 22 p.c. In contrast,
Eric White was condemned because its
pre-tax profit fell by 24 p.c. Perhaps it
would have been more fair to explain
that the tax provision was down because
the company was entitled to a double
tax reduction on expenses incurred in
establishing the Hong Kong and New
Zealand offices. Earning rate was still
a reasonable 35 p.c. In view of these
results, which share should sell at 13s. 6d.
and which at 125.?
Another example of the odd interpreta-
tion of facts concerned the discovery of
a tin-free steel for use in the production
of cans. When the announcement was
made by the American Can Company
some weeks ago, newspaper reports at
the time led one to believe that tinplate
Could be something of the past. And,
as tinplate accounts for 43 p.c. of the
world consumption of some 150,000 tons
per year, this could be very serious for
the tin producers. When a more sober
assessment was made, it was revealed
that the tin-free steel could at the most
only displace 3000 tons of tin per
annum. It will, in fact, be more com-
petitive with aluminium cans than tin
cans.
The best indicator of the impact of
tin-free steel on traditional tin markets
is the tin price. It momentarily weakened,
but has since moved above £stglsoo per
ton again. Now the summer vacation is
over in the Northern Hemisphere, all
metal markets, including tin, are ex-
pected to become more active.
Why am I talking about tin cans and
the like when what I’m really interested
in this week is inside the can. Beer is
a product that most of us are familiar
with; the particular brew that I’m recom-
mending is Tooheys.
Three years ago, when Tooheys’ shares
were 7s. 6d., I would have placed them
high on the list for selling. Now that
they are 10s. 3d. I think they are excel-
lent value. If Tooheys had progressed
as steadily as national beer consumption,
this would have been quite irrational
thinking. Even a superficial glance at
the profit record, however, shows that
matters were pretty desperate in the
early ’sixties. In both 1960 and 1961,
earning rate was only just over the
dividend rate of 9 p.c. Not a strong
position at all, when viewed against the
prospect of a 63 p.c. increase in issued
capital in 1962 when the note issue was
due to convert.
Thus, at 90 years of age, Tooheys had
become decrepit and was badly in need
of new direction. Management was
reorganised and almost immediately the
company became a much more dynamic
and vital organisation. The main
brewery in Sydney has been much im-
proved. Several of the hotels have been
extensively modernised.
The 21 p.c. increase in pre-tax profits
in 1964 is the first concrete evidence of
the progress of the new Tooheys. Profits
for the year just finished ought to provide
further evidence. Of course, the current
year should be helped along by the
recent increase in profit margins. My
order for 500 shares *vas executed at
10s. 3d.
The only stock to leave the portfolio
was Millaquin. The directors very
graciously waited until I had taken up
my short position and then announced
a substantial fall in profits. By buying
back at 335., I cleared £23.
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
500 Tooheys, 10/3 £261
200 Millaquin, 33/- £337
This leaves me exactly £lOO in debt.
Best news of the week for the portfolio
was Kolotex, with its l-for-4 bonus issue.
What an amazing company!
