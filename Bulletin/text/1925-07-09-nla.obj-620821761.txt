Mudie and His "Felonry"
The Red Page
Ines Mudie held a commission as sub-
■nant in the Marines, which he resigned,
then became a partner in the nianufac-
of medals. The speculation tailed, and
as so befriended by Sir Charles lorbes
he arrived in Sydney in July, 18-2, and
ved a free grant of 2500 acres at 1 at-
i Plains in the Hunter River district,
named his property Castle Forbes m
r of his patron, and commenced working
ith 15 convict servants. He lived his
year in the colony partly on Ins farm
partly at his town residence m 1 arra-
a. His farm was successful, and by
he, with his son-in-law, Mr. Larnach,
loyed about 100 convicts, bond and tree.
i came ail unfortunate trouble with some
Uis convict servants. Eight of them
onded from his employment, took to the
i, robbed his house, and fired a shot at
aacli, for which offence six of them were
ured, tried under the new Busnrangnig
and found guilty; live of them were
ged on Mudie’s farm 24 hours after sen-
te had been passed, and the other outlaw
transported for life to that living hell,
•folk Island. At the trial the men pleaded
t by continued ill-treatment by Mudie and
nacli they had been driven to such despe-
; measures. The Court refused to listen
lie plea, the law took its course, and the
i paid the penalty. But, the public being
sed, excitement ran so high that Governor
lrkc appointed a commission to inquire
o the complaints. The administration
the local magistracy had been attacked,
traducers were common convicts —vile
s at that —and as the principal witnesses
l been hanged, what more could be ex-
ited than that the inquiry would be a mild
'hitewashing” affair? Yet the convicts had
dently good ground for some complaint, be-
isc the Governor wrote: “Although it was
dent Mr. James Mudie did not treat ms
vants with the same consideration for their
nts and comfort which the neighboring
tiers evinced, yet upon the whole he hail
t in any remarkable degree transgressed
i regulations of Government. In tact,
udie was a bad master, about the worst m
, district. He believed that a man who
d once committed a crime, no matter how
vial, was beyond redemption. And he
ted accordingly. He was a cruel man m
lose nature kindness was unknown.
Bourke’s inquiry brought Mudie into dis-
vor with the community; and his spite
ainst the enfancipists—those who were free
servitude —increased. He bitterly opposed
e Patriotic Association and everyone con-
cted with it. That was to be expected
am such a Tory. His futile malicious per-
cutions of Watt, an ex-convict who was
b-editor of the Sydney Gazette, because
. had dared to criticise Mudie, brought him
to further detestation. He became more
id more embittered against the place and
e people, so lie sold his property, and in
arch. 1836, returned to England. Was he
tisfied with shaking the Australian dust
f his shoes, and severing his acquaintance
ith the penal colonists? Not a bit! In
ie following year he issued lus book
rke Felonry of New South Wales : Being a
lithful picture of the real romance _of Me
i Botany Bay, with anecdotes of Botany
ay society, and a plan of Sydney. By
ames Mudie, Esq., of Castle Forbes, and
ite a magistrate for the territory of New
outh Wales. London: Printed for the
uthor, by Whaley and Co., HolyweU-street,
nd sold by all booksellers, 1837. The
olume is dedicated “to all Members of bMh
louses of Parliament.” Oh, lie was going

orld know how badly Sir Richard Bouik

The book contains its pages consecutively
umbered up to 300: then follow two pages
/rongly numbered (293 and 294) ; and then
he pagination runs consecutively from 3-5
o 362. (There are no pages 301-324.) it
ooks as though some pages had been pur-
ibsely extracted before binding. Several times
luring my four decades connected with books
% have heard the story told that a section ot
he work was suppressed because it was
ibellous. The yarn was probably originated
w some vendor to effect the sale of a copy
hat seemed defective —and, like tar, the lie
las stuck, and from time to time keeps
turning up. I always challenge the state-
ment ; but no proof has been produced, only
•Well, I’ve heard so.” During the past
couple of days I have examined five copies
that belonged to such collectors as D. b.
Mitchell, Mr. Justice Wise, H. Gurner, and
A. Lee. During 40 years I have handled at
least a dozen other copies of the book, and
they are all identical. No section was ever
missing. The errors are merely wrong pagi-
nation. I don’t believe that whilst the book
was going through the press some matter
was suppressed by the author. The text is
consecutive and appears whole. If any sup-
pression had been made the odd pages sub-
stituted would have been properly numbered.
Mudie was far away from those lie was
attacking, and they could not hit back, so
there was not any need to suppress any-
thing. Let us dismiss the yarn as fiction,
and glance at the work. ..... «
Mudie’s vanity shows itself m the pretau
over the author's coining of the term
“felonry” to embrace all the inhabitants who
were convicts as well as those who, having
been sent out for their country’s good, were
free bv servitude. He accused Governor
Bourke aud Chief Justice Forbes of leniency
to the convicts to the extent of warping
justice in their favor. He said Forbes was
tainted with a spirit of duplicity and
treacherv. They were not bouquets that he
handed round' to the barristers Wentworth
•mrl Therrv. to the esteemed John Blaxland
and Dr! Bland, and to Mr. Kinchela the
\ttorney-General, of whom lie wiote . Defici
ent in legal knowledge, he lias not even the
address or manners or the language of a
gentleman. His utterance
tinctured with the brogue of Kilkenny. ine
“Felonry” is mostly an attempt by Mudie to
vindicate his actions in New South Wales.
As- a contribution to history it is ot no

ISIO. I suppose it was on account ot Ins
age—he was then 60 years old—that he was
not repeatedly called upon to give ‘the satis-
faction due to a gentleman.’ But in at
least one case family pride was hurt, and
one September morning in Barrack-street,
near the Savings Bank, a young man soundly
horsewhipped him and also hit him in tne
face. The sequel was a trial, Mudie v.
Kinchela, on October 26, 1840, when the
plaintiff claimed £lOOO for assault. The ve.
diet was against the defendant, but damages
were assessed at only £oo. The public e\ -
dently thought Mudie deserved all he got.
because the amount of the damages and costs
were defrayed by public subscription. And
that is the last we hear of Mudie—cruel,
vain and vindictive, but courageous in ex-
pressing liis opinions.

A Short-cut for Critics
The connection between literature ami the
social circumstances under which it is pr -
duced has always been an niterestmg prob-
lem What is the writer s relation to the
country he lives in and the public to whom
hi- makes his appeal.' Is he sport,
suddenly appearing among the herd like a
black lamb or a piebald colt, and responding
to nothing but the incalculable laws of his
emotional being V Or is lie, on the othei
hand, particularly sensitive bj his \ er.i
nature to the life about lnm, developing only
when it is rich in quality, and wilting when
it is poor? Purely aesthetic criticism is
not much concerned with the question; it
concentrates almost entirely on the artistic
product. Lately, though, there has giown
up a school of criticism intent on burrow-
ing into the soil of social life and mealing
the writer in its terms, .
In America, for instance, there is Van
Wyck Brooks, as penetrating a critic as the
country has ever produced, a man with a
style and a background of culture. He is
not hampered by the heavy, academic touch,
nor does he write for quick-lunch readers us
Mencken and Nathan do. Aet lie belongs
emphatically to the school of social critics,
and if he has a failing it is that he writes
too much to a 4 thesis. He is haunted by
the idea that the quality of American lire
is too thin and diluted to provide nourish-
ment for its writers. There is a lack in tlieir
surroundings of what Lawrence has called
"blood-life”; there is also a lack of the
emotional depth and fulness that comes lrom
centuries of intellectual struggle and achieve-
ment. American life is> neither really primi-
tive nor really civilised; it is merely a tepid
dream of comfort and mechanical progress.
In the very air of the unhappy country
there is a strained optimism that denies ate
both its deep rapture and its tragic dignity.
That, or something like it, is the idea with
which Van Wyck Brooks approaches his
studies of American writers. The Ur deal ot
Mark Twain” was a pitiless and revealing
work. Brooks deliberately aimed at destroy-
ing the legend of the good-humored, jesting
philosopher, who had a quip for every cir-
cumstance and whose springs ot laughter
never dried up. Instead he gave us a picture
of a tired, intimidated man, grinding out
hackwork to maintain a prosperity as great;
I as that of the neighboring draper or banker,
nervous about his public, forced by his wile
and those around him into keeping up a
fixed, mechanical grin at the comic appear-
ances of things. It is a picture of a giant
bound by a network of tiny threads, and
it is convincing. We know from Mark
Twain’s letters that he had a sense of fail-
ure at the end of his life. He . wished to
write a diary that would be published atter
his death and would reveal his real vision ot
things, but by the time leisure and freedom
had come to him he was too old. All he
gave us was a rambling record of disillusion-
ment. lit with sudden lightning-flashes—the
eruptions of a volcano that was nearly
I extinct. . ' ' ■ , ■,,
Now it is the turn of Henry James. Van
Wyck Brooks takes his letters and autobio-
graphical books and constructs from them
a portrait of a defeated artist who had no
roots in his own soil and could not success-
fully transplant himself into any other. W e
have Henry James shaking the dust or
America from his feet and trying to find a
home in the Europe that had intrigued his
imagination as a boy; loitering like a tourist
in Paris, Rome, Wiesbaden; settling \n
England and attempting to find material for
his art in the complicated structure of Eng-
lish society; finally hankering for America,
and retreating in despair from what lie found
there. A homeless, emotionally-starved man,
whose imagination became bankrupt in the
end, just as his style ran to seed! ilie
spiritual poverty of America had driven him
out. but he could not treat English society
with any freshness or intimacy, tor lie had
the sense of being an outsider —an observant
stranger, looking in at a warm, furnished
room through a window. And so we were
given books like “The Sacred Fount, which
is like a sonata played by a skilled musician
on a silver tea-tray. . \ •
There is nothing very new irt this vision,
of course, for Henry Janies was a master ol
language, wlio revealed himself in everv line
he wrote, and his letters have long been
public. It did not need the insight of Van
\\ yck Brooks to discover that Ins freshness
evaporated when lie had exhausted his
original impressions. "Daisy Miller had
wonder and delight in it, but ‘The Sacred
Fount” was the jaded work of a man who
bad nothing left him but technique. And
the tragedy was that, just when James- s
style had matured, his imagination began to
grow faint. If he had been able to settle
down in America and draw inspiration from
his surroundings he might have become one
of the greatest novelists, not only of his own
time but of any other. . ,
Van Wyck Brooks sees this: indeed, so
thoroughly is he preoccupied with it that he
tends to belittle James’s actual accomplish-
ment. That is the worst of working to a
theory. Everything must be made to fit. even
if it means lopping a little off the legs of
truth. And just now what may be called
the “social” theory'of art is being a little

overdone. There is Strachey with his “Emi-
ment Victorians” and his sense of an age that
overwhelmed all who lived in it. Upton
Sinclair has just written “Mammonart, a
book designed to show that “from the dawn
of history, the path to honor and success m
the arts has been through the service and
ojorification of the ruling classes.” Trotsky
has spent an enforced summer holiday m
the Crimea writing “Literature and the Revo-
lution,” a revision of much the same ground,
but with, apparently, a less rigid adherence
to mere dogma.
After reading a mass of such criticism
one’s chief impression is that any formula,
however good, can be done to death. This
social method provides a useful light for
some dark corners of the literary field, but
it is not a final source of revelation. And
there is a danger that, instead of leading
the reader inwards to the heart of the works
themselves, it will tempt him outwards to a
morass of vague speculation and social theo-
rLmg.
VANCE PALMER.
Aren’t We All?
It is good that we should get ourselves in
perspective, standing as it were apart, look-
ing critically on our little globe with its
clusters of human ants.
“What’s your most vexing’parasite,”
Bawled Earth to Mars, “since life began?”
Mars roared an answer through the night
In emphasis of thunder, “Man!”
A French philosopher, M. Charles Richet.
whose position in the intellectual life of his
nation was marked in, 1913 by the award of
the Nobel prize for physiology, has written
a book, L’liomme Stupide, which has been
translated into English with the catching but
not altogether equivalent title of Idiot. Man
(Werner Laurie). “Idiocy” denies intelli-
gence, whereas “stupidity” does not, in the
Professor’s meaning, infer that we have not
understood, but that we act as if we had
not understood, lie admits the intelligence,
and rages at its misapplication. “Many
people,” he declares, “will doubtless be aston-
ished that in comparing animals with men
I constantly find the animal less stupid.”
The animal is not endowed with reason ; it
would therefore be absurd to quarrel with
it for the non-exercise of a faculty it does
not possess. .Man, on the other hand, has
the perceptive* quality and misapplies it. “To
have reason and to be unreasonable is much
more serious than to lack the faculty of
reasoning.”
Richet views man’s stupidity from many
points. Take social inequalities: the sepa-
ration of men into distinct groups is derived
always from the principle of the hereditary
transmission of virtues. “The son of a king,
the son of a gentleman, the son of a rich
man; none of these have ever given any
proof of superiority while yet in the womb
or even in swaddling clothes.” Even granting a.
possible heredity of intelligence, “we can
only accord a very meagre superiority to
the sons of gentlemen and millionaires over
the sons of navvies and ragpickers. It is
an outrageous violation of right and justice
to dig so wide a gulf between the, two — 1
giving everything to the one and nothing to
the other.” The only classification tolerable
'o the author is one of merits —“On the one
hand, those who are industrious, upright,
brave and intelligent; on the other, those
who arc lazy, dishonest, cowardly and
utupid.” Any other classification is unjust:
yet the whole social fabric has been founded
n n such injustice for a hundred centuries.
It is “a state of affairs which would never be
found in any community of animals, even
the lowest in the scale of life.” Reforms are
talked of; but what do they amount to?
“The principle of socialism is to impose the
same yoke on all men without giving any
pre-eminence to the good or the brave.”
How stupid man is !
By long and scientific elaboration, and
by dint of unremitting toil, men have “de-
vised a product by means of which they
intensify their degradation and bestiality.”
This blockhead man has invented a hideous
poison, and made it one of his staple foods.
If this poison is constantly taken, then in-
fallibly reason l perishes utterly; yet every-
where, in town and country, alcohol is wor-
shipped like a god. “In Paris alone there
are 65,000 establishments for the sale of
this hateful product. Reckoning that each
retailer, with his wife, children and domestic
staff, represents six persons, that gives us
400,000 poisoners. One might divide
Parisians into two groups : 400,000 poisoners,
1.600 000 poisoned.” How incomparably
stupid man is! Could there be a more striking
proof_of his inferiority to the animals! Yet
to this universal poison he adds still other
toxic aids to his own destruction —opium,
cocaine and tobacco.
Then war—war that means death, death
and yet again death. How futile in its end!
It means irrational, stupid destruction of
human life ; wild, objectless annihilation. Yet
m en to. that end it is futile. Out of the
1500 million human beings on the face of
the globe the last war was able to
destroy only 15 millions—a mere fraction
of mankind, next to nothing:—
It is not death and destruction that makes me say
that war is the supreme infamy. For the new-
born replace the dead. Ruins are rebuilt. Trees
grow again. New crops are harvested. But there
is one sinister reality which nothing will have power
to efface while time shall last, and that is suffer-
ing. Suffering! Simply that. One vast and uni-
versal suffering.
The summum bonum of life is happiness. All
living things aspire to it; it is the goal
of their existence. Fifteen million deaths
may be no great calamity, for the dead do
not suffer, and births will compensate for
deaths, “But countless millions of victims!
Countless millions of martyrs! That is
the acme of human folly. . . . Ten million
mutilated, who will have to be supported by
public charity, represent the ‘ flower of 30
centuries of civilisation. This is the result
°r u r oes el,c * there. Famine
stalks the land: hatred, vengeance and fury
blacken the soul. “The whole of humanity
wallowing happily in blood and slime, and
finding therein some obscure, perverse joy
more hideous than a noble grief.” Fool,
fool!
, even in the days of peace, when not
Pesotted by war, in the tranquil days of civic
government, man is perversely stupid. He
lets venereal disease, cancer and tubercu-
losis rot the vitals of society relatively un-
checked. If all the authorities unitedly
deigned to take a few drastic precautionary
measures, syphilis could be stamped out in
three years. If but one-tenth of the whole
cost of the Great War had been spent in
combating alcoholism, syphilis and tuber-
culosis, these scourges would have dis-
appeared. “Our civilisations have never
dreamt of interrupting the joys of war that
they may heal their sores. They don’t want
to be healed. They want to fight! And that
is why the human species is a thousand times
more stupid than the stupidest animal.”
Finally comes death. It is inevitable, and
the man of reason should be resigned to it.
Yet he is angry, and bewails his fate. He
pictures it as terrible, though it is not: —
You go to sleep. That is all Nevertheless
from time immemorial, and in all countries, man has
spent his ingenuity in devising for himself fantastic
stories about the hereafter Our common fear of
death is, therefore, appallingly stupid. But it would
be idle to fight against it, as it is less reason than
instinct, and the instinct is justified, since every
living being should be possessed by the fear of
death in order to make the best of life.
Thus drops the curtain on the fool wander-
ing in the universe and drawing other vag-
rant fools around him to babble of “our glori-
ous civilisation.”

Charlotte Bronte and Belgium
“C.M.’s” account of the new Paris edition
of “Jane Eyre” (R.P., 11/6/’25) makes in-
teresting reading; but it is not so very sur-
prising, after all, that France should wish
to honor this remarkable Englishwoman of
letters. Charlotte Bronte certainly hated
many of the Belgians, but she loved a few
—perhaps it would be truer to say that: she
loved one. She made the hero and sub-hero of
“Shirley” the brothers Gerard Moore. half-
Belgian by birth and education; and Paul
Emanitel in “Villette” was wholly so. In
the latter she has surely painted the most
living, the most convincing portrait of a
foreigner that an English writer has ever
produced; and his faults and failings and
his great qualities were those of M. Heger,
of Brussels, of whom she wrote: —
I suffered much before I left Brussels. I think,
however long I live, I shall not forget what the
parting with M. Heger cost me. It grieved me so
much to grieve him who has been so true, so
kind and disinterested a friend.
But, however strong her affection for her
master, however violent her aversion from his
compatriots, the fact remains that they all
were Belgian, and not French; and Bel-
gians are not exactly popular with their
neighbors across the frontier. The people of
Brussels are Nordics, whose mother-
tongue is Flemish, a series of dialects whose
literary language is Dutch and closely allied
to English. She went to Brussels to learn
French from a people mostly bilingual, but
she very soon became aware that French in
the mouth of a Bruxellois is not the same
thing as French spoken by a Parisian —did
she not dilate upon the “horrors of the Bel-
gian accent”? Her remarks upon that ques-
tion, more than once repeated, must certainly
endear her to the hearts of the French, who
have always been extremely jealous of the
niceties of their language. As to their litera-
ture, whilst she admired Balzac, she thought
his novels left a nasty taste in the mouth :
but she gave unstinted praise to her French
sister-writer, George Sand, preferring her to
.Jane Austen, who “is only shrewd and obser-
vant,” for her grasp of mind and her poetry,
which made “out of something coarse some-
thing godlike.”
French people she met in Brussels, where
they were foreigners like herself, with this
difference, that they were Continental, whilst
she was insular. Judging from Pelet in
“The Professor,” and from Zelie in “Villette,”
she did not like them; but is it not the
English schoolgirl Fanshawe whom she pur-
sues with still stronger dislike?
Finally, it was to a Frenchman whom she
never saw that Charlotte Bronte paid a
tribute of gratitude and admiration which
France has repaid to-day. It was to a re-
viewer of “Shirley” in the Revue des Deux
Mondes ; “Eugene Forcade. .. .follows Currer
Bell through every winding, discerns every
point, discriminates every shade, proves him-
self master of the subject and lord of the
aim. With that man I would shake hands if
I saw him. I would say: ‘You know me.
Monsieur; I shall deem it an honor to know
you.’ I could not say so much to the mass of
the London critics. Perhaps I could not say
so much to 500 men and women in all the
millions of Great Britain.”
The question of the relations between
Charlotte Bronte and France summarily dis-
posed of. there remains the problem of her
real feeling towards Belgium—or, rather,
towards that damp, flatfish Flemish part
of Belgium which alone she knew; for she
never saw the charming hills and valleys of
Ardennes, never knew the quicker, smaller,
darker Walloon at home, but only the slow,
heavily-built Brabanter, now as then of
grosser appetite. She depicted the failings
of the Belgian with remorseless accuracy, but
beside the portraits of mutinous and licen-
tious schoolgirls, of mistresses unscrupulous
and cunning, hangs always the picture of
Paul Emanuel —of Paul Emanuel-Heger :
Belgium ! I repeat the word now as I sit alone
near midnight. It stirs my world of the past like
a summons to resurrection: the graves unclose, the
dead are raised ; thoughts, feelings, memories that
slept are seen by me ascending from the clods—
haloed most of them —but while I gaze on their
vapory forms, and strive to ascertain definitely their
outline, the sound which wakened them dies, and
they sink, each and all, like a light wreath of mist,
absorbed in the mouki. recalled to urns, resealed
in monuments. Farewell, luminous phantoms!
Belgium! Name unromantic and unpoetic, yet
name that whenever uttered has in my ear a sound,
in my heart an echo, such as no other assemblage
of syllables, however sweet or classic, can produce.
And it is because Charlotte Bronte wrote
these lines, and because she created Paul
Emanuel, that her own phantom seems more
luminous in Brussels than even in the par-
sonage at Haworth. Twenty years ago,
although the pensionnat of Madame Heger,
where Charlotte lived and taught and learned
so much, had already disappeared, it was
easy to reconstruct the mise-en-scene of the
Professor and Villette. Going down the
steps behind the statue of Beliard, from Rue
Royale, one saw, in Rue d’lsabelle below, an
old house and leafy garden where lilacs still
bloomed. Before the war, however, home
and trees had been swept away by the
modern builder. Even in a street near
by a whole row of old shops and
houses that Charlotte must have known
had been destroyed to form a terraced public
garden. And yet the phantom persists. Yon
will see it flitting before you in the Parc at
once so natural and so formal, slipping be-
tween the elms and beeches or behind the
paliers of clipped lime. You will never hear
the bell of Ste. Gudule, but you will think
how often she heard it, lying awake o’ nights,
alone amongst so many; and when you enter
the church you will find her there, the Pro-
testant, opening her passionate heart at the
confessional before a Romish priest. And
if you seek the Cities of the Dead beyond
the Porte de Louvain you will remember that
somewhere one she loved lies there.
DORA WILCOX.
Worthless Writers
I am tempted to ask who is this Lester
Way, despite his achievements on thte Red
Page; but I fear he would mistake it for
an anxious admirer’s inquiry, and can we
not see him expanding his chest and search-
ings for his clippings?
Now, I am not a writer. I have no clippings,
even of the humbler kind, to inflict on anyone;
but I do read, and this “Worthless Writer”
grates (R.l*. 11/6/125) In his cynical dis-
sertation we see the insufferable conceit of
a patron, and neither authois nor books re-
quire or want patronage. As Thackeray re-
marked: We don t want patrons, we want
friends; and I thank God we have them.”
It is to be deplored, but recognised, that
there is a good amount of literature of the
type that is “causing strife and discord, pro-
pagating fraud and inspiring scandal,” etc.;
t ? ... ,• n .. , , , -n • „i
lut it IS a caieflllly constl UCted illogical
argument to condemn all because of some,
even if their name is legion. Literature is
one of the most powerful instruments for
forming character, and giving us men and
women able to weigh evidence; and when
was the latter required more? “The more
~•i • • i „
<i man improves his leisure in such a way,
the better, gentler, kinder man lie must be-
come” , and a return to this way would
have a far-reaching effect in these days of
social, political and religions unrest. Litora-
ture has done much for the cause of morality
in the past. It can do much more.
And what of the world without writers?
If vou deprive ns of them von take awav
ir you deprive us or rm in you tarn away
our books, and they are the world s memory,
the goddess Mnemosyne, the mother of the
Muses. There is a terrible mental disease
which destroys a man’s memory and renders
him a nuisance to himself and his fellow-
men. So, too, the world without its books
would be an inconceivable chaos. From the
beginning of time man has sought for some
medium nf expression of bis thoughts achieve-
medium ot expression or ins thoughts, acineve
ments, etc., and m the earlier days crude
pictographs played their part. Later came
the complex hieroglyphic writings of Egypt,
and the cuneiform writing of the Babylonians
and Assyrians, until the modern alphabet
arose out of the basin of the Mediterranean,
, . , , r. i
Discover any race or people and you find
some visual means of expression has been
adopted.. It is innate in man to do so. In
Bookland we see the edifices and ruins of
all his works and days, his accomplishments
and defeats side by side, the vast tracts he
has traversed in the realm of ideas.
Again, could we see into the minds of men
we should find on all sides a longing for
expansion, a craving for escape from the
pettiness of the commonplace, a hunger for
the beautiful; and where could it be better
satisfied than in the domain of books? In
Bookland we roam at will. We are not
confined to our State or country, but can
travel to the ends of the earth, or leave this
planet and roam amongst the stars, or enter
into the realm beyond materialism and make
contact with the infinite.
Let us consign “The Worthless Writer”
to the place he belongs, and worship at the
shrine of the goddess Mnemosyne, who is
liberal in gifts to her votaries. There will
be found the well of thought and memory,
where can be had those copious draughts of
knowledge that will cause even our every-
day life to assume a new significance.
I am content to know “of making books
there is no end” and murmur a fervent
“Thank God!”

A Satchel of Books
Wide Waters, by Captain Dingle (Brentano).
After leaving school to ship before the mast, Alden
Talbot Drake inherits a family estate. Social duties
irk him and the wide waters call. He is shanghaied
and then rejected as useless, but to prove his worth
stows aw'ay in the clipper Orontes. There he is
bewitched by the bright eyes of a lady passenger.
A brutal skipper, a woman and a youthful lover
provide material for a drama by one who seemingly
knows all there is to be known about ships and
sailormen. A racy yarn.
Oh , Mr. Leacock! by C. K. Allen (John Lane).
The fact that the author of “Literary Lapses” is
also a Professor of Political Economy suggests an
incongruity of which Mr. Allen makes full use. Here
is an extract from a burlesque lecture by the Professor
in his academic chair: “Capital and Labor are very
different. The more Capital you have the more you
want to take out of other people; whereas the more
Labor you have the more you want to pass on to
other people. If you pass on enough of it .you arc
said to have Organising Ability, and you succeed in
business; if you don’t pass it on you deserve all
you get, and you get it.” Light, bright and often
witty.
Picturesque Travel, 1925, the annual published by
Burns, Philp and Co., is a more delectable piece of
bait than ever. One of the most interesting section:
is devoted to travel inside this variegated continent.
There is no excuse for the Australian to plead
ignorance of the North when an aeroplane that flies
weekly to scheduled time can lift him from Longreach
and deposit him in Cloncurry in 44 hours, w'hile the
earth method takes three days. Also taxis are avail-
able to take him in four hours to Camooweal from
Charleville, which can be reached by rail from
Sydney ; the next stride, to Darwin, will come shortly.
And the X.T., in the right season, is a sportsman’s
paradise.
Murty Drown, by E’. S. Sorenson (N.S.W. Book-
stall Co.). It is fortunate for those Australians who
prefer the home-made goods that there are writers
like Sorenson to keep interest in their own country
alive. Certainly Sorenson’s backbloclcs are vastly
different from the bush of to-day, with its Ford cars
and radio sets; but he is a born economist who is
going to extract every ounce of humor from his
mine of material before he commences prospecting
elsewhere. The bulk of the fun arises out of physical
accidents; and although his characters are of the
exaggerated Steele Rudd type, they are a hospitable,
jovial crowd for whom you feel you would like to
shout the longest beer ever drawn. An excellent book
to pass the time while waiting in the queue to pay
your income-tax.


Better and Better
Dependable ten years ago, and five years ago,
and more dependable than ever to-day,
Dodge Brothers Motor Car simply represents
the latest phase in a process of continual
betterment.
The first cars Dodge Brothers built established
a world-wide reputation. The cars they are
building to-day incorporate the accumulated
refinements of those ten intervening years.
That important improvements in the comfort
and appearance of the car are made from
time to time implies no basic departure from
Dodge Brothers traditional policy of progres-
sive rather than seasonal development.

Sorrow at the desk next to mine;
A young man mourning,
Forcing out his work, line by line,
Wondering at finding no sign
Earth has ceased turning.
Wondering, he thinks “She is dead ;
Our life has ended.
Yet all hearths save ours still burn red;
Still all loves are hungry, are fed ;
Quarrels are mended.
“Still these others live as before,
Happy and hoping;
Only I am happy no more.
Seeking for a way to the shore,
Stupidly groping,
Stretching out my hands for a line.
Tide without turning! „
Tide of sorrow, sour as stale wine.

I Was Down By the Sea One Day.
I was down by the sea one day,
And saw an ocean-ship unloading
Cargo of spices from eastern lands,
Its dusky crew from coral strands,
Smiling as though their task was play,
Laughing at the white-man’s goading.
That day I was down by the sea,
rupm'.vies came back surging
Of a bygone day
\\ hen, in toe i ..stern way,
1 loved for awhile as she came to me
With soft-lipped whispers urging.
I returned that day o’er the sea,
In the swift white-winged ship Memory,
Back to the moghra flowers
The jasmin-scented hours
And the cinnamon garden ’neath the tama-
rind-tree
Where together we sang Love’s symphony.
I shall return many times o’er the sea,
When sweet scents and perfume call
Ale back to her arms
And sweet memories’ charms;
I shall listen again to her insistent plea
In the temple-garden ’neatli the palm-trees
tall.
I shall often go down to the sea
When ships bring eastern perfume;
I shall see her amber eyes
Under dark starry skies,
And feel her lithe body in the arms of me,
When the oleanders bloom.

WALTER MOOD.
FROM OVERSEAS.
And I, when I go back again
To Sydney, shining through faint rain,
I should desire a dawn of grey—-
Grey folding rose —to light our way.
Here where a sword the sunlight falls
And red hibiscus by white walls
Burns in the noon —oh, I shall dream
Of that dawn’s rose through.grey agleam :
Dream of our gliding softly through
The smooth stilled harbor’s wakening blue,
All in a hush while gulls sweep low;
Gladness near tears my heart will know!
I shall forget the leaning palms
On lonely isles, the burning calms,
And poignant feel, as in old years,
My city’s welcome, feel her tears.

Magpies at Sunrise.
The valley’s purple gloom to lilac turns;
A running fire is on the mountain-top;
And like a molten stream that cannot stop
The sunlight down the slope a long path
burns,
Leaps the rough fence and floods my green-
house wall,
And the white blind, limp in the windless air,
Then lingers, flirting with the roses there.
Kissing the loosened petals ere they fall.
Now comes a bird, its plumage lustrous jet,
Tied with the white of rain-washed cotton-
fields ;
And such a magic fairy flute it wields.
I strain to follow, fearing to forget.
Now conies a joyful flock of them, to thrall
With their high chorus all the brightening
skies; ...
Their ecstasy my own, in fairer guise.
All, see, I, too, spread wings and soar and
call!
Just for one breathless moment do I span
The mysteries of gravity arid space,
And cleave the air and seek that airy space
In swelling joy that holds no thought of man.
From love of gain and Passion's shackles
free,
Not knowing poverty nor fearing pain,
I rise until the rapture bursts amain—
Being too great to last, abandons me!
They have dispersed. Only a mass of cloud
Streams like a tangled ribbon o’er the sky;
Too sweet the dream to be earth-bound as I,
It ceased with that bird-singing, clear and
loud.
Only beyond the brown arc of the hill,
Where the grass-laden breaths of cattle
steam,
Mingling with odors of warm milk and
cream.
The wistful roses watch and listen still!

AXLE-GREASE AND AXE-GRINDING.
The track of the proposed standard-gauge
South-to-North railway instalment from Tar-
eoola to Alice Springs (as an alternative to the
extension of the narrow-gauge concern from
Oodnadatta to the same half-way house) was
lately viewed by an official expedition of
hand Board men, sent out with a sole eye
to business. The report which resulted was
distinctly favorable. But this was followed
■by a Ministerial visit, and Parliamentary
inspectors are naturally liable to consider
various things, including the number of
existing votes along the proposed line, the
number of new votes it is likely to produce
in time for them to be helpful to existing
politicians, and the number of votes that
might be lost if an end was unkindly put to
the scheme for tearing up the old-standing
and much-postponed treaty, and spending
Commonwealth money in Western Queens-
land and N. S. Wales instead. The Parlia-
mentary party, it is said, came back de-
pressed, which was probably the way it
started. The semi-official report is to the
effect that it will be impossible, for many
years, to earn “axle-grease” with a line which
is to stop in the middle of the continent,
which is to finish for an indefinite period
Vhen it has got over the worst country, and
es better prospects ahead, and which is to
a tropical venture in the sense that it
will leave off abruptly about a gunshot from
the tropic line. In addition, the proposed
but despised work is to develop the Northern
Territory by keeping almost entirely out of
the Territory, and far away from all its
ports and its most promising mineral coun-
try, the said Territory being a region where
the Government promotes settlement by re-
fusing to sell any settler an inch of land to
settle on. The “axle-grease” which allegedly
can’t be earned for a while under these
trying conditions doesn’t literally mean the
necessary but disagreeable substance of that:
name. The expression signifies that the
work will probably pay nothing towards in-
terest on borrowed capital, and fall some-
thing short of working expenses. The idea
of paying no interest on borrowed capital,
but constructing in full Australia’s first
transcontinental line out of revenue, would
at least have the charm of novelty. Some-
thing might be done in the way of recouping
the Treasury later on by the sale of farms
and township allotments along the track.
That trade should yield a profit even though
a little compensation was due to lease-holders
with some years yet to run.
* * *
The “axle-grease” tale may be described
in rude terms as one of the sickening hypo-
crisies of the day and of the country. If
a large and costly work is mooted in a fairly
well-settled part of the little bit of Australia
which is really settled, or, in other words,
where there are influential interests to be
considered, and its construction doesn’t
arouse the animosity of bigger interests else-
where, say, in Melbourne or Sydney or
Brisbane, the fact that said work i$ ex-
pected to be a staggering loss is hardly con-
sidered. But if it is proposed to spend
money on the development of the public
estate, and to pioneer the empty spaces with
funds that the occupied spaces can always
spend on themselves, then it becomes a dogma
that Australian politicians never invest loan
funds where an immediate profit is not
assured, and would sooner perish and dis-
pense with Christian burial. N. S. Wales
is the oldest of the States, and is alleged
by its admirers to be the richest, yet its last
published returns set forth that it possessed
58 railway lines or sections, representing
3545 miles out of a total of 5523 miles, which
failed to pay “axle-grease” and interest. One
notable cripple began this game 40 years
ago. Of these, 27 paid no interest and also
failed to meet the grease bill. The mmibers
have been added to since. The unfinished
fragments, one at each end with a yawning
gap in the centre, of the South-to-North rail-
way are quoted to the point of acute bore-
dom by opponents of pioneering as a shock-
ing and dreadful warning, especially the
southern fragment, which is 478 miles in
length. Yet N, S. Wales owns a 111-mile
undertaking which in some years beats that
profligate as a money-loser, and is never
far behind it. It had last year five lines
which beat the Northern Territory under-
taking for insolvency. The Darwin-Kath-
erine River affair is 199 miles long, and the
Ma State’s 111-mile Demopdrille-Blayney
investment last year successfully dropped
£35,000 more than the rival contrived to do.
The extension of the track from Inverell to
Grafton. and the coast, which is supposed
to conflict with Sydney interests, has been
blocked for years on the “axle-grease” plea.
Yet the Killarney-Grafton project, which
doesn’t conflict, was endorsed almost at a
moment’s, notice. The official estimate was
that it will lose in a year, when finished and
doing its best, almost exactly as much as
the 677 miles of incomplete transcontinental
put together. Incidentally, it will closely
parallel three other lines, all great droppers
of money, or expected to be so when com-
pleted.
* * * *
The unpayable habit pervades a wonderful
number of Australian institutions without-
exciting much remark. The Queensland
western lines are confirmed insolvents, and
so is the 40-year-old Nyngan-Bourke speci-
men in N.S.W. Yet the craving of the cheeky
schemers who decry every effort to open up
the Northern Territory with a Federal line
is to get these State bankrupts linked to-
gether with a Federal line, for the develop-
ment of State territory. The East-to-West
railway, which was built to appease political
interests at Perth, and which traverses a
stretch where the alkaline waters eat the
engine boiler, was a worse axle-greaser than
the two unfinished fragments of the South-
to-North undertaking combined until the
visible interest bill was cut down. This bill
stood at £222,352 in 1920, and at only
£102,099 in 1923, the curious result being
that while the partially-built South-to-North
affair was debited with £129,091 interest on
£4,034,802 of construction and equipment
money the route to Westralia was charged a
mere £102,099 on a cost of £7,301,433. These
facts, or fakes, •stick forth without explana-
tion in the Commonwealth Bulletin No. 15
(Transport and Communication). Y r et de-
spite all efforts to put a good face on things
the Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie-Perth undertak-
ing is a visible loser of the malignant type.
The Commonwealth mercantile fleet doesn’t
pay for its axle-grease nor even for its bilge-
water. It has lost, in capital, more than the
cost (construction and equipment) of the
four Commonwealth railways combined. It
lately proved itself capable of losing, in a
given time, as much money as the four com-
bined, and even then depreciation wasn’t
provided for, and a good part of the dis-
appointing crowd of ships was doing no ser-
vice. The fleet is supposed to be the cause of
a reduction in freight rates, which enables
imported drapery and whisky to get here
more cheaply, and climb over the Customs
barrier more successfully, and it has indi-
rectly caused a big outlay in strikes. The
Queensland Government’s small but much-
boomed cattle-stations enterprise, which
has written off nearly £700,000 of capital
as lost, is an axle-greaser of a bad sort.
During the financial year 1923-24 the six
States spent about £8,000,000 of loan money
on undertakings which are not expected to
make any direct cash return, for axle-grease
or for any other purpose, though they will
cost a large amount for maintenance.
* * * *
The situation may be summarised thus:
There is one important work to which the
Commonwealth is pledged. There is need
of this work to furnish a chance for the
development of more than half a million
square miles of Federal estate. It is required
in order that the national claim to the tropi-
cal Centre and North-West may rest on some
feasible basis, for the settlement, on 790,320
square miles, of 856 additional white inhabi-
tants in 30 years doesn’t constitute a claim
that will last. It would be a short cut sav-
ing an immensity of sea distance between two
coasts, while the East-West line is longer than
the sea route, and fails more and more badly
to compete as a goods carrier. As a means
of supplying employment it would be as
good a job as the next job. Yet this national
undertaking is the only one of any import-
ance to which the weird rule is applied that
it must not be born unless it proves in
advance that it can pay its way from infancy,
If the hostile political pull is too strong to
be resisted by the present school of politicians
it would be more honest to say so, and not
trouble about the axle-grease argument.
OUR GREAT ADVENTURE.
The recent doubt thrown by Prime Minister
Bruce upon the theory that Australia could
rely on Britain for the support of its most
important article of faith raises the ques-
tion as to the real object of the Australian
nation. Every nation is, first of all, an asso-
ciation for obtaining food, shelter and com-
forts ; but the nation that has no vision be-
yond that is not likely to strike its roots
deep nor endure long. It is true that the
vision of the progressive nation is not always
a clear one, nor does it remain fixed through
the years; but the abandonment of any high
principle founded upon a faith in the future
is a sure sign of decay. While some of the
tremendous national growths from compara-
tive insignificance to greatness have been
directly due to religious impulses which
altered the view of the world, other concep-
tions of duty, freedom and law have had
even more significant results. The rise of
Persia under Cyrus was no doubt directly
due to the influence of the creed of Zoroaster.
Through that the scattered Persian tribes
were united, the alliance with the Modes
was made possible, and the fighting arm of
the soldiers under one command was strength-
ened by the knowledge that every victory
meant the liberation of nations from the
bondage of cruel religious systems. That
Persia itself grew cruel enough when Asiatic
servility had made its leaders into luxurious
despots does not alter the fact that the origi-
nal invasion of Cyrus was a war of libera-
tion and that the conqueror was large in his
mercies and broad in his views. Similarly
the first Arab leaders of Islam were fired
with a holy zeal that linked with great kind-
ness and curious tolerances. The fighting
armies of the Prophet believed that they were
bringing light and truth as Avell as purer
and juster laws. In plain fact, a large por-
tion of the Grecian world submitted to their
reign without a blow because it relieved
cities and districts from the galling condi-
tion under which they were living. The first
advance of Ali and Abdul was a chain-
breaking event in a world of falsehood and
oppression. The brutality and religious hate
which marked more modern Turkish advances
were mostly associated with conquests gained
after serious reverses, and when the original
world-reforming spirit was gone. Of a
different kind was the triumphant march of
Alexander and his Macedonians. There the
moving spirit was the advance of Greek cul-
ture and institutions, the plunder of the
Orient being used for the cleaning-up of the
conquered places. The Macedonians were,
in fact, spiritual mercenaries of Athens, doing
the work to which neither the size nor valor
of the little city had ever been equal. These
are outstanding examples of the power in
practical affairs of a great vision; and in
every case the vision, though at first national,
embraced so much of the world that the
nation was lost sight of.
* * * *
Far more in line with Australian possi-
bilities was the vision of Rome, which ex-
ceeded the bounds of nationality but never
forgot the nation. To make the nation safe
by a continual conquest and Romanising of
its possible enemies was the central notion. To
make straight roads, straight laws, straight
administration, on and on to the last limits of
the world, was to maintain such a security
at the centre as might never have been
broken. Unfortunately later Romans lost
the vision, and people with quite narrow
views used the long straight roads to gather
to the plunder of the imperial capital. The
British idea was very like the Roman, but
the geographical position was different. The
sea provided the long straight roads; and
instead of marching legions ships spread
the frontiers to the utmost bounds. The
British faith in the peace of commerce may
have been a partial thing and applicable only
to certain periods; but out of it grow the
broad colonisation which established British
Dominions in three continents and British
outposts in all the seas. Where other races
were concerned, British rule may not have
been an unmixed blessing any more
than Roman rule had been in earlier
ages: but there was no question about
British sentiment in the matter. The
members of the advance guard of the
growing nation did regard themselves as
bringers of good to others—their faith in
British institutions and the benefits of trade
were sometimes almost pathetic. To-day,
while that faith has been lost in some direc-
tions, it has grown in others. The vision has
changed, not. been lost; and the constant
evolution of British thought in relation to
the world is the best proof that the nation
is alive. It is difficult to point to any other
large nation possessing anything b'ke the
same mental hold upon the future. Though,
for the moment, domestic problems may loom
large in the British mind, and the business
of finding food and shelter for so many mil-
lions may be a grave concern of statesmen,
the outlook still widens. The. Briton, in
fact, sees two worlds, one British and the
other foreign, much as the -Roman saw the
Roman Empire and the outer barbarians:
and though the British Dominions and de-
pendencies are far wider than any that ever
acknowledged Caesar, the parallel holds in
that the proportions are much the same. It
might be argued also that the problems are
much the same; but the advantage is with
Britain of possessing a fuller knowledge and
a wider experience.
* * * *
Australia, in common with the other
Dominions, shares the British tradition : but
here men have seen another vision which no
other people may fully share. The Com-
monwealth represents the greatest national
experiment in history. Other nations have
always been forced to play a part in an in-
ternational game of conflicting interests and
shifting frontiers, of dangerous racial hates
and armed interventions. Britain, from its
insular position, was saved from many of
these; but the narrow English Channel did
not quite keep national interests from clash-
ing with those of other peoples across the
waters. Yet insularity formed a protection
from many more dangerous things than mere
armed attack; and for nearly 900 years there
was little race admixture and comparatively
little thought-disturbance from abroad. The
Briton evolved his own modes of life on
his own soil, and was little warped from his
national aims. Australia took up the run-
ning with a whole continent instead of a
small island on which to work out a new
nationality. The continent was not, perhaps,
large as a continent, but it had that which
made it equivalent to a separate world. Its
range of climate and soil gave all the possi-
bilities of living a full and complex modern
life without seeking from foreign hands any
important product. It was an empty field,
replete with all that man could need and
calling only for sturdy toil and intelligent
industry. It was the most complete home
the white race ,had found; and the White
Australia policy was the perfectly natural
outcome of a vision which saw the white
race attaining on Australian soil more than
circumstances had ever permitted it to at-
tain elsewhere. In a sense the British vision
expanded until it reached Australia, where
it was concentrated and intensified. Prime
Minister Bruce is probably right in declar-
ing that many people in England do not
appreciate this, and that their failure to un-
derstand it may at some time leave Australia
isolated in the mattfer of defence; but though
that statement may look alarming in its
present setting, it should do nothing to shake
the faith of Australians. It is no hyperbole,
but the downright truth, that the realisa-
tion of the vision of all that White Aus-
tralia may bo would constitute not onh
the greatest achievement of British people
but by far the grandest thing attempted
by the white race.
* * -* *
Though the undertaking is still in the
nature of an adventure it is a national duty
and even a world duty to see it through. The
people who look upon Australia as one of
many countries to be exploited as swiftly
as possible for as much bread, beef, beer
and amusement as can be got out of it are
missing the truth and blind to their own
honor. A far rndre honest statement of the
position would be to describe the people of
the Commonwealth as the crew of a ship
bound upon the greatest voyage of scientific
discovery in the history of the world. Ni-
sei once can be greater than the science of
man. and no adventure greater than one
which leads into the uncharted future. We
have only one danger to face which is of
real consequence. Our kinsmen in England
may fail to understand, but a few genera-
tions will make our aims clear enough to
every white man the world over. Our will
may be challenged from without, but if we
are prepared to meet that challenge it wifi
be answered as the white race has answered
such challenges before. Our real danger
does not lie in these directions, but in the
failure of Australians to realise what Aus-
tralia means. Our hold upon Australia is
based upon our attitude to Australia. To
merely get bread and butter from it is not
enough. We are not the finished product
of nationhood, but the pioneers of a vast
movement. If we lose sight of that, all else
may go ; —our bread and butter with the rest.
Yet if every toil of every hand and brain
could be consecrated to the Australian ideal,
as every scimitar slash of early Islam was
to the desert creed of Mahomet, the issue
could never be in doubt.
PROPOSED EXIT OF THE IMPORTED
STRIKE NUISANCE.
Provided the" administration of the Federal
Amending Immigration Act, when it becomes
law, is on a par with its possibilities, the
measure will cover a multitude of past sins
and make amends for a futile and flickering
Ministerial record. It arrives late, for the
outrageous provocation which gave rise to
it began some distance back in last year,
but that is because it isn’t the Australian
way to hurry, except in loan-floating mat-
ters. The provisions are reasonably com-
prehensive, and look even drastic to some
Australians, but that is because some Aus-
tralians have become accustomed to the idea
that any kind of white alien has a right to
enter here in the sacred name of Liberty,
and, when he has entered, to conspire openly
for the promotion of every kind of crime
which can be included under the term “revo-
lution” (and there are few which can’t), in
the equally sacred name of Free Speech. They
were even beginning to learn from one par
ticular importation that every nigger, pro-
vided he is a “worker,” has the same rights.
The bill now before Parliament would not:
be regarded as drastic in Britain, where the
old ideas about the rights of undesirables
have been greatly modified in recent years.
In the last year for which figures are avail-
able the Cold Country excluded 1997 persons,
deported a considerable number, and so con-
ducted itself that the addition to the foreign
population amounted to only 271 carefully-
sifted aliens. The British have gone so far
that “His Majesty may, by order in Council,
impose further restrictions on aliens,” which
practically amounts to a blank cheque, tin-
same to be cashed on emergency. And the
Australian bill would be considered mild in
some countries of Continental Europe where,
after such a happening as the Townsville
riots of a few years ago, aliens of the dis-
turbing sort are first bagged by the police
like wheat, and then exported in bulk, also
like wheat. Australia being now officially a
nation —a full-blown member of the League
of Nations, on whose list it comes immedi-
ately after Abyssinia, Albania and Argentina,
and one of that Commonwealth of Nations
which is called the British Empire—the bill
lays down the simple national principle thus
any person born outside is within our gates
by permission, which may be withdrawn if he
proves offensive and damaging. Labor-leader
Charlton, who opposes the measure because


that is “the duty of his hive,” would probably
act similarly by the strange man or dog in-
side his garden gate. If the objectionable
person has been naturalised by mistake there
should be no difficulty about revoking his
certificate. In Britain one of tine Secretaries
of State attends to that matter in his spare
time.
* * *■ *
The methods by which a non-Australian
may be uprooted and sent out of the country
at the public expense when flhe Act becomes
operative are much less offlland than those
by which a real Australian often uprooted
out. of trades-unionism and put outside the
wage-earning fraternity in bus own country.
A district may be declared *by the Govcrnor-
General-in-Council to be in a state of indus-
trial disturbance, and sudli a district can
generally be identified. Then any non-
Australian who is busy “hindering or
obstructing, to the prejudice of the public,
the transport of goods or; the conveyance of
passengers in relation to ’ trade or commerce-
with oilier countries or mnonp the States"
(the italicised words lof>k superfluous and
a possible pitfall) “or t)ie provision of ser-
vices by any department! or public authority
of the Commonwealth” may be called upon
to show cause for his further continuance.
In other words, he may be summoned before
a Board, and if he fafils to convince that
body that he isn’t the nuisance he appears
he may be put on a shi/p for transmission to
his homeland, the sliip» having no option .of
refusal. The Board nfiy apparently be dis-
pensed with, and the Minister be his own
authority, if the non*-Australian has been
convicted of an often(jb against, the laws of
the Commonwealth ‘'Yelp ting to trade and
commerce or conciliation; and arbitration for
the prevention or settlement of industrial
disputes, and the Minister is satisfied that
any of the acts constituting the offence were
directed towards hindering or obstructing
to the prejudice of the public the produc-
tion or transport of gomds, or the convey-
ance of passengers, or tl4‘ provision of neces-
sary services,” all this provided the Minister
thinks that the defemlafint looks like break-
ing out afresh. There is talk, however, of
toning down this provisb. Everything is to
be done by process of law. The possibilities
of exclusion of applicants for admission are
large, but not too large. It is difficult to
see how the Labor party, which grumbles
bitterly at all immigration, cfan logically object,
to the exclusion clauses unless it desires to
admit suspects and tin desirables, and no
others. And it vs bard to see how it can
reasonably carp at 'the deportjation of the
alien disturber, who usurps the place of the
native disturber, takes tbe broafcl out of ms
mouth, and is an Outrage on the principle
of “Australia for the Australians. ’ Still
the party objects and carps in ii straggling,
struggling sort, of way.
* * * *
The shipping trouble, which has dragged
on for three-quarters* of a year.i.has not been
a strike but an, insujrrection. It was organ-
ised and eondefcted with ferocious energy by
men who w e/re not Australians., and not
always even citizens of the British Em-
pire. The ‘most erfanky and unreasonable
orders of tlift'se freaks Were obey old by Austra-
lians. montm after nioruth, with a tameness
which has caused inantv people to revise their
estimate of an allegedly independent and up-
standing community. The struggle was not
to secure better terms and conditions for the
employees; in fact, tlur fury of the hostility
was directed against tlii; Commonwealth ship-
ping line, which supplies its workers with by
far tin*- best marine conditions known, in addi-
tion to representing tli' cherished principle
of pnblic ownership. X<* reason was assigned
for this. Being told by t their freaks to hate
and make war upon public ownership the Aus-
tralian seamen did so. JThe avowed purpose
of the campaign was to Institute a disorderly,
erratic and uncivil ineitiKid of ship manage-
ment. to no visible end except the satisfaction
of being uncivil, which is Similar to the plea-
sure of expectorating on the\pavement and say-
ing “Blanky.” Every time a vessel was ready
for sea it was to be delayed till some demands
which had been tlnjiurht up for the occasion
were satisfied; also till the i#isentce fireman
left off drinking. Sbme of t.ho demands were
more grotesque than others, especially in one
case where the slap ay as not to sail until the
owners negotiated Hie release from the lock-
up of a complete stronger in whom they took
no interest at all. The job-control idea did
not imply that the unions would “take over”
the ships, and be responsible for accidents
and losses, and find new ships when old ones
wore out, and syt the world an example of
management. Ttie controllers were to take
such earnings as tl*i system allowed (much
more in the case of i(hc Commonwealth line),
hut it was not imagined that they would be
large enough to malke any improvement in
the financial condition! of the men even if
the business kepft going. The capitalist, as
his share of the bargain, was relied upon to
start the ship After the embargo was re-
moved, the job-00111rollers being an uncerti-
ficated lot who didn't know how to start;
he was to manage, to pay losses and to do
replacements. This was the part which the
imnorted freaks sketched out for him, but he
failed to take kimdly to the arrangement. And
the only benefit that can be identified was
to go to the imported revolutionaries, who
were to have the satisfaction of shouting
and ordering their fellow creatures about,
if that can he called a benefit, and the idea
that they had brought the revolution and the
general work-sfloppage somewhat nearer. It.
seems unsatisfying, but a professional dis-
turber. if he left off disturbing, might have a
hard struggle to live. Some of them disturb
for very poor salaries, but still the pay is
better than they would be likely to get at
any useful work.
DEMOCRATISING INDUSTRY.
Over a century ago a keen Parisian politi-
cian remarked: “If people with property
allow- political powder to be transferred to
those who have nothing, they need not be
surprised if the latter proceed to transfer
the property.” Since the war that process
lias been in very active operation, and in no
country more tluan in Britain. Death duties,
colossal income-taxes and other impositions
on the one hand, and on the other a ipillion
and a quarter of the population living on
doles, are the patent and indisputable
evidences of the transfer, a transfer
none the less real and effective because it is
put through in a strictly constitutional
fashion. In Australia we are face to face
with another development which the politi-
cians of a previous era made inevitable
although they failed to envisage it. In hand-
ing political power over to the masses these
legislators handed over the control of indus-
try. Edward A. Filene, in "The Way
Out,” states the problem pithily:—
When you give to men who do not like to be bossed,
but whom ,vou have been bossing industrially, the
power to boss you politically, and when they realise
that they can get very definite material advantages
by bossing you politically, you have set tile stage
tor a contest that will not be stopped by any
instrument or policy of mere opportunism.
Fiuene is not an Australian, but in this
passage lie has correctly outlined the posi-
tion of things in this continent to-day. Em-
ployees not only have political power, but
they outnumber employers to such an extent
that, given anything approaching a conscious-
ness of their power and a solidarity of pur-
pose, employees can get by political means
most of the things they are unable to get
by industrial means —that is, within certain
limits. Job-control is by no means confined
to the Seamen’s Union. It is more preva-
lent than most people imagine. But the
power upon which job-control is resting is
the political bludgeon that frequently domi-
nates both State and Federal Parliaments.
Witness the history of the Commonwealth
mercantile fieet, of the State railways, and
of Government trading enterprises gener-
ally.
It is absurd to expect that masses of men
who can control Governments by organised
action at the polls, or by blocs in assemblies
humorously called deliberative, will not at-
tempt industrial control as well. The mere tact
that they can control taxation puts into their
hands a weapon of enormous power. What
some people call "industrial democracy,
meaning thereby industrial control, is, in
the long run, the inevitable result of the
conferring of political power on the multi-
tude. What the multitude cannot achieve
inside the industry by industrial methods
they will most certainly attempt to achieve
outside the industry by political methods.
Under our present system we give a group
of men power over an industry for which
they have no responsibility. To make that
industry safe you must make this group re-
sponsible. Filex’e imagines the thing can
In accomplished by “so conducting great busi-
nesses that, by raising wages and lowering
prices at the one time, the masses employed
will have increasing economic freedom.”
That particular method is good enough in
its way, but it docs not awaken in the work-
men the feeling of responsibility. Other
American employers, with shrewd Yankee
insight, have hit on a much more feasible
solution. All over the U.S.A. at the present
time wage-earners are being induced to take,
up shares in the great business concerns in
which they are employed. There are plain
every-day 'toilers employed in big American
concerns whose dividends are as great as,
or even greater than, their wages. No rise
asking those men to strike or to sympathise
with the I.WAV. It is time we all realised
that the fixed-wage method in industry is the
begetter of countless evils. Particularly
should the employer recognise, that the fixed-
wage system, by divorcing the workman from
any interest in the success or failure of the
enterprise in which lie is employed, is dis-
tinctly injurious to employing interests.
In Australia to-day the average worker is
prone to hail any stroke of taxation that hits
the employer hard as a triumph of demo-
cracy. tie fails to realise that it is
industry, not the individual, that pays. Give
him only 50 shares in the concern and liis
point of view immediately changes. Our
employers should follow the wise American
example and “democratise ’ industry by making
the wage-earner a divideiulaire. Some people
imagine that this would mean job-control ;
but nothing could be further from the truth.
The workman made a shareholder would be
vitally interested in capable management:
lie would know perfectly well that comrades
Tom, Dick and Harry are not capable man-
agers, and that liis 50 shares would be m
serious danger if they ran things. Moreover
he would begin to look round, to notice waste,
to make suggestions by way of helping his
business along. In time, too. lie would have
to be consulted at shareholders’ and com-
mittee meetings and would come to see that
Ms interest and the company's were one
and the same. Year by year so-called “demo-
cratic” legislation tends to tighten the grip of
job-control. Compulsory arbitration, as far
as protecting employers interests is con-
cerned. is an empty sham. What safeguard
remains then for commercial or manufactur-
ing adventure? One and one only—make the
toiler a partner, a sharer in good and evil
fortune. The employer who does so will have
little friction in his business, will attract
the best type of workmen, and will feel that
Ids men’s interests arc his and liis interests
are theirs. He will cease to employ mere
hands and will be the guiding light in a
band of partners. The security of capital
in anv State must be based on its diffusion.
A land with a few score big millionaires and
a multitudinous proletariat is to-day as good
as lost. A country in which the masses have
political control must inevitably drift into
placing industrial control in the same hands
unless a barrier be erected. That barrier lies
in the, shareholding system. America, that
country in which we are told the Money
Power’is an unbearable tyranny, is really the
land wherein capitalism is most secure, be-
cause in the last 10 years the number of
small capitalists has increased enormously.
The American plutocrats are wise men in
their day and generation.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Brisbane and Some Broken China.
Shocking ignorance of the actual conditions
was displayed by members of the House of
Reps, in the debate on whether the Aus-
tralian cruiser Brisbane should stay in
Chinese waters while trouble is on there or
run away. The worst exhibit came from
that curious blend of pacifist and jingo,
W. M. Hxjgiies, alleged by many admirers
to be nothing short of a sage in international
affairs. Hughes drew -what he called an
analogy with a story of white larrikins
assaulting a Chinese cabinet-maker in Lons-
dale-street and the Chinese Navy bombard-
ing Melbourne in redress. Actually no
fighting whatever has taken place on
Chinese territory. The original uproar
began when Chinese operatives stormed
and damaged a Japanese mill in the
Shanghai international settlement, which is
under the jurisdiction of the foreign consular
body. The settlement was originally leased
from the Chinese Government, and the
foreigner was invited to come along and build
a city. This he did to such purpose .that
the city is now bigger than Melbourne, ano.
probably as prosperous. Home of its pro-
perty is owned by Australians. W ith an
eye on the Red objective, the Chinese want
to collar the settlement without paying
for the improvements, and they have been
busily demonstrating along its borders and
along the borders of all the other foreign
concessions which are similarly situated.
The European guards only fired on the
demonstrators when they heaved ironmongery,
supplied mainly by Soviet Russia, at white
residents, or when they attempted to enter
without knocking. Another foolish utter-
ance came from Anstey, the Labor lieu-
tenant, who said that the disturbance was
exclusively a struggle by the Mongol water-
front workers to secure better conditions
from the Imperialistic exploiters of their
labor, and that it was a movement deserving
Australian support. Actually the foreign
employer has as much chance of improving
the conditions of the Celestial worker as
Mr. Anstey lias of bailing Burrinjuck dry
with his hat. Owing to the fact that the
international settlements have nopporerw r er to
impose a tariff, wages and hours of work
inside the foreign pale are controlled. by
conditions in China proper. And conditions
in China proper are beyond belief or Mr.
Anstey’s worst experience, and will remain
so until the Chinese birth-rate is revised. A
rambling expression of muddled idealism was
to be expected from Matthew Charlton,
and it duly arrived. Matthew said that
the way the British Government was going
on, the League of Nations was doomed. There
are more things likely to be doomed than the
smiling League if the present challenge of
Asia and Bolshevik Russia to the prestige
of the white races is handled in the timid
fashion recommended by Labor altruists.
The Asiatic understands and appreciates no-
thing so well as firmness and consistency,
and any faltering by the Powers now that
the pot has boiled over will result in worse
chaos. The only reasonable utterance that
brightened the Federal debate came from
Donald Charles Cameron, the Digger
M.11.R. for Brisbane, who. speaking from
personal experience of China in time of dis-
turbance —experience to which neither the
chameleonic Hughes nor any of the Labor
pacifists can lay claim —emphasised the need
for action such as had been taken. Aus-
tralia has no interest in grabbing conces-
sions or territory in other countries, but if
she stands, as she is supposed to do. for
the protection of white standards from the
assaults of the yellow race within her bor-
ders, she cannot logically refuse to assist in
the protection of her nationals in China
when their lives are threatened by Asiatic"
gone temporarily off their heads.
More Commissioners for the North.
Minister Pearce's bill for camouflaging the
case of the Northern Territory has made an
appearance, before the Senate. It is a shifty
and apologetic obiect. and this is a news-
paper summary of it
The old name is to be dropped, and 455,000
square miles of country are instead to be named
North Australia and Central Australia (tlie terms
are dazzling in their originality), and put under a
Commission. The fate of the other 68,020 square
miles doesn't appear. Possibly the seeming dis-
crepancy is more accident.
There are to be three Commissioners, a Government
Resident and a Council, so there should he plenty
of administration.
The Commissioners are to “maintain and operate”
many concerns and works in Northern Australia,
including railways, roads, ports and harbors. In
the constructive line they will be authorised to
“report” on works (including railways) exceeding
£25,000 in anticipated cost, which may be proposed
by the Parliament. The difficulty lias always been
to get that distant body to take enough interest in
the great Federal property to seriously propose any-
thing, bar sending a small Tasmanian Judge up to
look round.
Works in Central Australia are not to he under
the Commission, though public lands arc. Informa-
tion about the works problem is expected later.
The Commission is to he a strikingly independent
body, with command of its own funds when it can
get them from Parliament (it will have no taxing
powers of its own), and with its own borrowing, powers
provided the distant Legislature passes its estimates.
Thus undertakings, if they get started, are to “pro-
ceed uninterruptedly” unless the money runs short.
The State Governments at Perth and Brisbane are
invited to join in running the show, and may put
some of their adjacent territory into the pool, not
surrendering the sovereignty of it, but apparently
taking any financial benefits which may accrue. It
isn’t professed that Westralia and Queensland have
done anything in particular for the Territory, and
Westralia, at all events, has a very poor record as
a developer of its own north. Furthermore, both
their State capitals are about as far removed from
any central point (say Daly Waters) in the new province
of North Australia as Melbourne itself. South Aus-
tralia, which transferred the Territory to the Com-
monwealth on conditions which have never been
fulfilled, has apparently not been asked to join in
running the show. Yet Adelaide is closer to the
aforesaid central point than either Perth or Brisbane.
There is amazingly little of a visible sort
in the scheme, though, of course, the division
of the Territory and the invitation to two
very remote State Governments to take a
hand looks like a prelude to the log-rolling
of another long East-to-West line, to con-
nect the emptiest part of Pearce’s State
with two other empty localities. The dreary
Minister had a lot to say about the lack of
means of access to the Territory, but unless
lie regards a batch of additional placemen
as a means of access his bill proposes no-
thing. And he said much to the effect that
the place is governed from too far away.
That has been said already, and the proposal
to shift scraps of the ruling influence to
Perth and Brisbane is getting further away.
The remedy lies in getting enough popula-
tion to make self-government feasible, but
population comes slowly when it comes by
camel or bullock-dray or the auxiliary oil-
liner Huddersfield.

The Sermon on a Mount.
If the new Sydney Government develops a
turn of speed N.S.W. and Queensland may
start the 44-hours system almost abreast,
which will make it a fine large experiment,
extending about 2000 miles from north to
south, and affecting more than half the popu-
lation of the Commonwealth. One of the
early results ot the proposal to require 8)-
per cent, more pay for the same amoqnt of
work, or to put in 81 per cent, less work for the
same pay, is, as this paper lately reported,
that the Mount Morgan gold- and copper-
mine may definitely pass out, aged 39 years.
This will be no small disaster; yet, if the Gov-
ernment were to take it over, and work it on
philanthropic principles, with 44 slow and
well-paid hours per week, the blow to the
Treasury might be fatal. Prices might rise
with a rush and save the. situation, if
Providence took a special interest in the
Gillies Government; but Providence told
man to work six days per week, and it may
not go out of its stride to do a good turn
to a five-day Cabinet. What effect the 44-
hours idea will have on the sugar mills is
a matter for speculation. The Minister who
looks after these affairs has intimated that
no more permits for the growing of cane
will be granted, as the supply is now ahead
of the demand in the sheltered Australian
market, and at the present cost of produc-
tion a surplus of any size can't be sold
abroad except at a heavy loss. That looks
bad for increased employment in the indus-
try. As to the division of existing employ-
ment, it was stated recently that out of
783 caneeutters registered for the season
at Ingham only seven are of British descent;
and that is a considerable fly in the oint-
ment of high pay and short hours. An un-
expected development is that many Gov-
ernment employees admit they don’t really
want a shorter week so much as they want
to be paid overtime for the tail-end of the
old longer week. The police have already
sold their reduced working, hours for cash,
and the railwaymen are said to be anxious
to do the same. This arrangement does no-
thing for the twelfth man who hoped to get
into the service, but it may prevent the
eleven who are already in from turning on
the Ministry in anger. There is no.joy in
the prospect of other industries joining the
category in which the product costs more
to produce than its possible selling value.
Still, Queensland politicians think they see
one gleam Of hope arising out of some such
circumstance. The 44-hours system in N. 8.
Wales is expected to sufficiently cripple that
State's industries as to make it of. mucli less
importance as a competitor. Which may
explain why Brisbane orators came across
to lend a helping jaw at the recent elections.

The Laggard Telegraphs.
An ex-telegraphist on his old job:—
Insufficient, lines and equipment, the stubborn
refusal of the Murray multiplex system to rise to
the occasion, and Providence playing skittles with
long-distance lines are the main causes of the sluggish
movement of our telegraph traffic. All these could
be remedied in the process of years; even Providence
would find it a tougher job interrupting an under-
ground cable than an unstable land line. But the
“process of years,” especially when the Government
is the timekeeper, is an altogether too tiresome
process.
Even under the present unfavorable conditions
much could be done in hastening the traffic; but
the most reasonable remedy immediately applicable,
that of grading the traffic, is never heard of now.
It was mooted a few years ago and became an
echo. It is time to resurrect it.
At present the Department accepts telegrams on
any subject under the sun, takes the messages as
they come and despatches them in their turn, it
has but two classes of traffiee—urgent (double rate)
and ordinary rate. The urgent messages are deter-
mined, not by their actual urgency or by the Depart-
ment’s estimation of their urgency, but simply hv
the sender paying double rates, although the sub-
ject of the telegram may be birthday greetings or
a wish for a bon voyage- Half the urgent-rate traffic
by no means justifies its classification as urgent ;
hut chivalrous swains and social climbers consider it
ever so much move impressive to serenade a lady
friend or a new-made 0.1!.E. with an urgent telegram
in preference to the common, ordinary-rate message.
So they pay double rates, and preference is theirs.
In the ordinary-rate traffic, lovesick youths, horse-
racing limpets and the fiends who rush to con-
gratulate everybody of social tonnage on every
occasion, taking great care to append tlieir full
suburban address, flood their messages over the
counter, engulfing commercial business and matters
of life and death, and blot-king the bottle-neck where
frivolous telegrams of minor importance dribble
through at the expense of something of real conse-
quence, delaying the latter for long periods. One
would not concede to the commercial telegram a
“divine right”; but, after all, apart from death
and sickness and a few other occasional happenings,
the commercial telegram has a right to be treated
with more consideration than a message that is
but a highly.-paid-for social letter. At Christmas
and New Year the telegraph facilities are choked
for days with thousands of greetings and wishes,
while matters of business are dragged into the
flood and emerge hours and hours later.
Everybody has a right to send telegrams and say
what he likes (within the bounds of decency), but
the Department should assert the right to classify
its traffic, relegate the trifling and unimportant to
the tail-ml of the batch, and give the important the
consideration it deserves. The principle is observed
in other postal matter, first-class, second-class and
so on being graded. A letter is treated as first-class
matter, while circulars and newspapers follow in
their order of importance; and so a telegram of
apparent importance should have preference over
a bedtime story from Augustus to his beloved or
a gushing greeting from Mrs. Darlingiiurst Flats
to Sam SiLVERSinES, 1i.8.E.
The option of paying double rates for preferential
treatment is grossly unfair to large firms trans-
acting business costing hundreds per year; and
even when they do pay double rates they find that
that facility is as much abused as the ordinary
rate. The urgent-rate traffic is also loaded with
intra-departmental matter that is franked or goes
through under cover of the O.S. stamp. The grading
of traffic into, say, illness, commercial, sporting
domestic, social and miscellaneous —not exactly jM
that order perhaps—and treated preferentially, wofl
put the telegraphic services to the use for
they were intended.

Anomaly Land.
Westralia, where the secession movement
and the Federal grievances grow, is a land
of contradictious. Nowadays it is largely an
agricultural State; as a matter of fact, it
has more land under Crop in proportion to
its population than any other State bar
Bouth Australia. Yet among the simple pro-
ducts of the dust with which it fails to
supply itself, as shown by the surplus of
imports over exports, are butter and butter-
substitutes, cheese, bacon and hams, milk
and cream, sugar, eggs, honey, poultry,
barley, beans, peas, bran, pollard, oatmeal,
hops, onions, potatoes and beer. The last
detailed returns are for 1922-28, aud they
set' forth that, during 12 months, the Jarrah
State bought from abroad £897,369 worth
of butter, cheese, bacon and ham, and milk
and cream, while it only sold abroad £2423
worth. That might be agricultural, but it
wasn’t very agricultural. No other State
lias quite so big a proportion of its area
either as unoccupied State land or leased
State land, and none quite so small a one
as private holdings. Yet no other State has
spent so much borrowed money, in propor-
tion to population, in buying back private
land on which to plant settlers in order
that they may grow butter, cheese, bacon
and milk. The State election arrangements
are a marvel. The eight electorates with
most names on the roll and the eight with
fewest showed up in this way at two dates
less than a year apart:—
30/6/’24. 4 / 4/’25.
Eight big electorates .. 71,244 79,138
Eight small electorates . . 5,715 6,389
If that doesn’t mean a brisk rush of people
to the large centres, and a fairly brisk
exodus, despite all the “settlement” expen-
diture, from the districts where the missing
vegetable ought to grow, it at least suggests
some possibility of the kind. Nothing has
been done to the electorates since 1911. Two
specific Westralian demands, if the witnesses
before the Federal Grievances Commission
are a representative crowd, are for a local
tariff inside the Commonwealth to protect
Westralia against its eastern neighbors which
send it butter, or else separation from the
Commonwealth so that it can make an effi-
cient Protective tariff for itself. Yet West-
ralia sends an aggressive Freetradc push to
the Commonwealth Parliament. Its Coun-
try party, which amuses itself by waving the
Cobden banner that Britain shows a ten-
dency to discard, is trying to put a Free-
trade pledge into the Ministerial programme
so far as Westralian candidates are con-
cerned. And in the latter days of .Jimmy
Mitchell’s ill-fated spendthrift Cabinet the
State Assembly consisted of 18 Cockies,
waving their fiscal flag where it served no
good purpose, 8 Nationalists. 18 orthodox
Laborites and 6 sundries. Naturally, the
State is ruled by Labor now. Labor polled
a minority of votes, but managed to cep
ture a majority of seats, thanks to the exist -
ence of the eight small electorates aforesaid.
Some of its 27 members represent more aban-
doned poppet-heads than people. But that
is nothing out of the way in the pleasant
Land of Upside Down.

The Well-meaning Amateur.
Melbourne is up against the problem of an
increase of crime amongst its young folk.
Its case is not an isolated one, for the world
over the same difficulty is being faced in
less or greater degree. The officer in charge
of the Victorian children’s courts reports that
8328 youngsters were dealt w T ith last year.
About 75 per cent, of their offences consisted
of larceny and kindred breaches of law, 85
per cent, of which were committed by boys
aged from 11 to 16 years. During the last
four years the number of inmates in gaols
whose histories showed that they had been
before children’s courts has steadily increased.
It was hoped that these courts would serve
as rescue houses for boys or girls who might
be drifting into crime, but the report indicates
that there is some weakness in the system
which defeats that end. Possibly the defect
in question is local, for the Victorian law
differs materially, both in scope and admin-
istration. from that of other States. In
N. S. Wales, for instance, the age-limit is
higher and the executive duties are in the
hands of stipendiary magistrates. And better
results might bo got in Victoria if the age-
limit were extended and the administration
taken out of the hands of well-meaning ama-
teurs and put into those of the trained pro-
fessional magistracy. But the report indi-
cates a more serious difficulty common to
all these courts which cannot be so easily
dealt with. The officer-in-charge calls atten-
tion to “the great harm which is being done
by boys who absconded from the reforma-
tory,” and suggests that some place be
obtained whore such boys could when re-'
arrested be kept beyond the possibility of
escape. This raises the whole question of
reformatories and whether they reform.
The well-meaning amateur has a child-
like faith in these institutions, be-
lieving that they provide an environ-
ment which must leave an impress of
lasting good on the youthful mind. Healthful
position, picturesque surroundings, ample
food and useful vocational training are all
met by the average institution, but the fly in
the ointment is that the children must inter-
mingle. And where vice and relative inno-
cence meet the latter is easily led on the path
to the gaol. Every herd system leaves its
members open to contagion. In N. S. Wales
the tendency is to seek reform in every other
avenue before the institution is resorted to.
It is reckoned better to place the young
offender on a farm than to send him to such
an establishment. The number of commit-
tals from Sydney to institutions is yearly
decreasing. What to substitute in their
place is a problem not easily solved, but it
is undoubtedly open to grave doubt whether
reformatories do reform.

The State as Station-owner.
Pugh's Almanac devotes 70 pages to a list
of Queensland’s “stations and grazing farms”
which carried more than 200 cattle or 500
sheep by latest returns. As they averaged
about 80 to a page the total should be about
5600 separate establishments, and life is too
short to carry the investigation into closer
detail. The Government, whose enterprise in
taking to the station-owning business has
HIS OLD MAN OF THE SEA:
“Speaking on the new Federal Loan Bill, Mr. Charlton, leader of the Labor party, pointed out that
the national debt now exceeded a thousand millions, and said that the matter needed very careful considera-
tion, as a population of 6,000,000 could not continue to carry that load.... The N. S. Wales Labor Gov-
ernment has provided sand-shifting jobs for Sydney unemployed.”
CHARLTON: “Great pity, preat pity!"
J.ANG : “That reminds me, well have to tap the Old Man for another advance. Our
sand-shifting money is running low.”
roused so much admiration among its sup-
porters, owned 15 of these at June, 1923.
Out of 6,396.514 cattle in the State it owned
218*413, or barely 3£ per cent. Out of 660,387
horses it owned 7184, or less than 1 per cent.
Of Queensland’s 16,756,101 sheep and 132,243
pigs the Government’s own statement doesn’t
show it as possessing a single animal. In
fact it was, in 1923 (latest figures), pro-
prietor of below 1 per cent, of the State’s
live stock. It is now announced that it will
be necessary to write off £674,189 as lost, and
when that is done it is anticipated that the
show “will be in a position to operate in fail-
competition” with private owners who pay-
all manner of charges from which the State
concern is exempt. If private cattlemen ha'd
made a downfall of their business on the
same heroic scale the loss in the cow branch
of industry alone would be over £19,000,000.
In addition, the State cannery is to be
written dow-n by £89,959 and the State fish
supply by £44,080. It helps a Ministry to
have billets to dispose of, for the most
stupid and inefficient crowd can give away
billets, but the community pays (or owes)
a lot in the process. The amount of loan
money invested in all the State industrial
undertakings of Queensland at June, 1923,
was officially given as £876,472, and if there
is any earthly connection between the items
it is a very big writing off for the size of
the show.

When the Federal censure debate was on
the usual Freetrade pterodactyl informed the
House that “the wit of man has never yet
devised a means of paying for imports except
by exports.” It is a pleasant theory, in-
tended to prove that there is no need to re-
stict the. importation of goods for fear they
may destroy industries, since if they do other
industries will automatically arise to make a
corresponding quantity of export goods in
payment, and will replace the lost employ-
ment. Unfortunately neither the wit of
quidnunc, wiseacre nor ass has devised a
means of saying when the payment will be
made. The Australian States (apart from
the Commonwealth) at recent advices owed
£343,000,000 abroad solely by getting im-
ports, often to the great detriment of local
industry, and not paying for them yet. No
doubt there will be heaps of work for every-
body when Australia starts to fulfil the whole
gospel of Cobden by making and exporting
£348,000,000 worth of goods in excess ot
its imports, and settling up, but when will
the rush of employment begin? And if the
country forgets the art of production through
sacrificing its industries to the importing
craze, how will it ever begin? The Bank-
ruptcy Court is kept busy winding up the
affairs of spendthrifts who have imported (oo
much and failed to export enough to balance
the account.
The abolition of extra-territoriality, or the
right of foreigners to be tried in their own
consular courts, is one of the demands the
Chinese Government is making on the Brit-
ish. The privilege with the long name has
a very old history. It was exercised by the
Romans in foreign countries, by the Levant
company in England in the days of Eliza-
beth, and by Englishmen when they occu-
pied Australia. It has been reluctantly given
up by Europeans of recent years in Japan,
Korea, Siam and Turkey. The Russians and
Germans resigned it for commercial advan-
tages in their new treaties with China after
the war. One of the first victims was
Ostroumoff, formerly general-manager ol
the Chinese Eastern Railway. He has been
awaiting trial in a Chinese prison for seven
months. Chinese prisons are not unbear-
ably luxurious, and their sanitary service
could be improved.

“Borom.” : I sent an order for some goods
to a firm in another State* and asked that
the articles be despatched through the Post
Office’s handy “Value payable” system, by
which the authorities collect the bill on
delivery and remit it to the sender. Bv
return of post I was notified that the firm
refused to have anything to do with the sys-
tem, and that the goods ordered would be
sent and charged to me instead. I ascer-
tained that the prejudice against the “V .P.
is the result of business people being kept;
waiting for their money by the Post Office
Packages have been delivered and the money
for them collected within a few days, never-
theless the senders have had to wait three
weeks or a month for their money, although
they were within a few hundred yards of a
post office. Hence many business firms now
decline to despatch goods by the collect-on
delivery system, and so country people are
denied a valuable convenience.

“Loco”: Dual buffers may be a cause of
wheels jumping off narrow-gauge railway
lines (B. 25/6/’25), but I am inclined to
think the overhung build of the rolling stock
is more to blame. The 4ft. 84in. gauge
carriages' are almost, if not quite, as roomy
inside as the sft. Sin. rolling stock. Con-
sequently they hang over the wheels about
Sin. more on either side. I have noticed
the sway that passengers get when striking
a curve at, say, 50 miles an hour on the
narrower gauge in N.S.W. I have never
observed if on the sft. 3in. Victorian and
S.A. through line,. Give me a sft. Sin.
gauge under my engine wheels. Buffers do
not matter so much. Tn any case, if the
buffers are not kept together by the screw
couplings the consequent jerking of the train
would be worse than awful. Where buffers
are dangerous is where they are of unequal
heights from the rail. In Victoria, for. in-
stance, there are goods trucks of various
capacity—lo tons, fitnd more. The springs
are not always adjusted accordingly. Or a
heavily loaded 10-ton truck may come next
to a 10-ton “empty.” Regulations provide
for adjustment, where the margin of safety
is deemed over ample. A good deal of
time is often taken in shunting trucks from
one place to another in goods or mixed trains
to equalise buffers. But railwaymen are
as liable to err as any other class. The
danger in unequal buffers is that one may
be broken off and drop on to the rail, to say
nothing of the disarrangement of the spaces
between the vehicles (pausing unequal pull
on the draw gear. Finally, almost all
modern carriage broad-gauge rolling stock
is fitted with a continuous buffer right across
the end, with a shank at each side.

“Lex” on two out-of-the-way courts: —
Poked away in an unobtrusive part of Sydney are
two minor courts, one c*E which deals with juvenile
delinquents and the other with affiliation matters.
The morals, or want of them, that are tossed about
iii these two shy tribunals are almost as ,scarlet as
the covers and contents of the modern society novel.
“Sex morality,” says tivat acknowledged authority on
social psychology, William McDougali,, “always has
been, and must ever continue to be, a difficult pro-
blem for the human rqjce. And the difficulty of the
problem increases rather than diminishes with every
forward step of civilisation and every increase of
the control of far-sighted intelligence over the more
immediate prompting* of human nature.” These two
courts arc perhaps in thds respect as good an object-
lesson as could be found in our midst. Take this
one case out of the# many that daily flow through
their doors. A girl, for she is no more, is before
the Court, and the question is put to her: “You
have been living an immoral life?” To this conies
promptly the answer: “Nc* I ain’t.” “But the
police say they know you well, and have proof that
you are immoral.” “I don’t care, I ain’t immoral.”
“Do you say you don’t go with men?” “No, I don’t
.go with men. Igo with cine man. That ain’t im-
moral.” “Are you married to him ?” “No, I ain’t
married, but he’s the only man I go with, so 1
ain’t immoral.” Then the another is put in the
witness-box and questioned to* tlie same effect. “My
girl ain’t immoral,” she protests; “she ain’t been
with only tire one hoy.” And' 1 that is the attitude
taken up by not one but many tof the folk who come
before these courts. After all, it is not unreason-
able. Many of these girls are doubtless quite faith-
ful to the one man; it is only the convention —a
necessary social convention, no doubt—that is lack-
ing, and they resent the imputation of immorality
as indignantly as the conventionally married wife
would resent it. The court officials, if you gain their
ears, will tell you that many* such conventionallv-
immoral girls subsequently ma;rry, and make faith-
ful wives. Indeed, on the whoh? they compare quite
favorably with their sisters undfer the skin who live
in the fast sets of what Jewries described as the
“Hupper succles.” It is becoming increasingly diffi-
cult to define immorality.

The average Australian, either on the basis of private

POLITICAL
POINTS
Federal Treasurer Page lias a surplus, and
one or two States have a surplus, and Fuller
would have had one if he had hung on to
the end of the financial year. But they con-
sist of paper, which is of no more value for
paying interest bills in London or averting
the demand for new loans in London than if
they were made of old brass and bits of glass
and similar currency. Unless this country
contrives to do with less imported wares, and
produces more for its own use or for export,
the foreign loan must go on till the foreign
lender grows alarmed or financially short,
and puts in the plug.
‘"How long has a man to be resident here
before he becomes an Australian citizen?”
passionately demanded Federal Labor-leader
Charlton in his speech against the deporta-
tion of imported Communists. Who can tell,
especially if the man is a public danger?
How long has a Chinaman to be resident
here before he becomes" a white Australian
citizen ?
A. C. Willis, Vice-President of the N.S.W.
Executive Council, argued the other day that
his crowd couldn't be held responsible for
Walsh, of the Seamen’s Union, since that
person didn’t belong to the Labor party. But
Walsh does belong to the Labor party. He
represented the Seamen’s Union at the
annual Vic. Labor Conference in April. And
he would very likely have represented it at
the annual N. S. Wales Labor Conference
if Willis, being president of the State A.L.P.
and in that capacity a law unto himself,
hadn’t called it off. Many native-born
Laborites have been expelled for being faith-
ful to Labor policy, but apparently any im-
ported troubler-maker, even if he has stood
against Labor candidates and assailed the
White Australia doctrine, can join the party
and no questions asked.
W. M. Hughes, when in office, had such a
craving for absolute power that the business
of getting him and his War Precautions
authority apart long after the war was
equivalent to removing a lion from a sausage
by the tail. But he dressed for a new part
When the Immigration Bill came before the
House, dnd appeared as the defender of the
rights of the foreign Communist to be here
if he darned well likes, and to do pretty
much as he darned well pleases when he is
here. Hughes, who never took kindly to loss
of office, has been in a frightful temper of
late. He is a shifty politician, and a shirty
one when things don’t go quite to suit him.
He may be a Nationalist, and therefore a
follower, Wt he looks too much like a pur-
suer.
In South Australia the Cocky party _is
standing on its hind legs and its dignity
because Wilson, the Migration Minister, de-
clines to allow his name to go to a pre-
selection ballot. In N. S. Wales, in parallel
circumstances, the C.P. wouldn’t make such
a demand, but in S.A. and Westralia pre-
selection hasn’t yet been abolished, though
it is a straining of the principle to insist
on a Cabinet Minister having to weather
the test. In Wilson’s case it is poor policy
and worse judgment, for no other S.A. Cocky
candidate, even were he plastered all over
with unqualified C.P. endorsements, could
win a Senatorship.
The N. S. Wales Labor Government of
1920-22 had 13 salaried Ministers. Fuller
began with a dozen, and after Cocks’s trans-
fer to London he managed with 11. Lang
is starting with 12 and an honorary, but
the fact that Cann has been named Minister
and Fitzgerald Assistant-Minister for Health
and Local Government—two small depart-
ments which could be easily run by one man
—suggests that a pretext will soon be found
for another appointment, if not more. It
is generally safe to bet that anew Labor
Government will increase (1) the number
of Ministers, (2) Parliamentary salaries and
(3) taxation.
Hitherto the Queensland sugar industry
has got more kicks than ha’pence from Vic.
Federal members, but Senator Guthrie paid
STICKLER FOR PRINCIPLE.
“Many Labor members really believe in the orovisions of the bill authorising the deportation of
lawless aliens, but their party alleges that the measure is an abomination.”
BARMAID BELINDA BRUCE: "Let me take that cockroach out of your beer."
CHARLTON: "Not on your life! I don’t like drinking cockroaches, but I’m not going to
allow any interference tilth the liberty of my beer !"
it a handsome tribute during the Address
in-Reply debate in bis House. An extract —
Recently, with other Senators, I visited South
Africa. Despite the fact that the average rate of
wages paid in the sugar industry is from Bs. to 10s.
a week, compared with an average of 255. a day in
Australia, the price of sugar is no lower than in
Australia, and South African sugar is very inferior
to ours. The Queensland sugar-fields are much better
managed, and their machinery is much more efficient.
I formed the opinion that cheap black labor led to
inefficiency, and I returned to Australia more firmly
convinced' than ever that the policy of a White Aus-
tralia is a correct one.
Guthrie’s statements were not reported in
the Melbourne daily most addicted to pub-
lishing fustian about sugar barons grinding
the faces of the poor.
Vic. Country Roads Board has recom-
mended the Composite Government to de-
clare six principal roads State highways so
that there will be central control, except as
to the township portions. A few* millions
sterling will be needed to do the big jobs.
The Prince’s Highway, from S. Aus.
border along or near the south coast
to Mallacoota, Melbourne to Mildura,
Bendigo to Echuca, Melbourne to the S.A.
border (via Ballarat, Horsham and Dim-
boola), Melbourne to Wodonga and Bairns-
dale to Omeo and Wodonga are the routes
suggested, and the Commonwealth Govern-
ment is looked to for a contribution of
£lBO,OOO p.a. for five years. A Common-
wealth Government with a surplus of
£4,575,000 and a general election to fight in
nine or ten months is reckoned an easy mark.
An enterprise which pays only 5 p.c.
dividends can’t afford to reject the business
of regular customers or let its workmen
decide what jobs should be accepted and what
shouldn’t. So when the employees of Mort’s
Dock and Engineering Co., Sydney, inspired
by Communist work-stoppers, refused to
repair a steamer belonging to the Newcastle
and Hunter River Co., with which the said
work-stoppers have a quarrel, the manage-
ment paid them off. On the same day, how-
ever, the Communist push was worsted in
another quarter. Rejecting the job-control
lunacy, of which the imported and inflated
Walsh wrote recently that it had “come to
stay,” six unions of the marine transport
group signed an agreement with the Common-
wealth Shipping Board, and offered to sign
one with the steamship companies, guarantee-
ing the smooth working of ships on the
Australian register, conditionally upon the
deregistered Seamen’s Union being granted
the terms and conditions of the Arbitration
award. A significant extract: —
Should the Seamen’s Union flout the agreement
under which men sign on any vessel, and persists in
preventing the sailing of ships or exercises job-
control, this group will bring all possible pressure
to bear on the union to observe the conditions afore-
said, and if the union continues in its attitude it
will be isolated from the group. In the event of these
measures not being successful, the transport group
will not oppose any measures affecting the manning
of the ships to permit of their continued running.
It is a very definite repudiation of Walshism.
If an equal amount of commonsense is
brought to bear on the Mbrt’s Dock matter
and other affairs of the kind, peace will
return to the distracted waterfront, and the
Australian shipping industry may escape the
ruin which would have been the certain re-
sult of the Walsh-Johanson madness.
Crockett’s exit from the Allan-Peacock
Cabinet brought intense relief to other mem-
bers of the Ministry, his querulous com-
plaints having bored them stiff. One of
Crockett’s objections was that Premier
Allan had disregarded the F.U.’s direction
to take a ballot of wlieatgrowers as to
whether they desired a compulsory pool,
although the Cockies’ Central Council agreed a
month ago to accept the voluntary' pool for
five years, with a 75 p.c. guarantee. Another
grievance was that too little had been done
for the grower of dried fruits. That indus-
try is certainly in a bad way, but what Gov-
ernment assistance can do for it is being
given in no grudging spirit by State, Com-
monwealth and Imperial Governments alike.
The climax was reached when Crockett
pitched into Allan at the Agrarian Caucus.
The Premier demanded the mutineer’s resig-
nation. Crockett dared Allan to administer
the boot. Farmer John waited for two
days, whereupon Crockett resigned. J. R.
Harris, Cocky M.L.C., med. and vigneron,
has been given the vacant job.
The idea, mooted in London, of putting
these spendthrift States on a reduced allow-
ance of loan money can be explained by the
simple fact that the spendthrift States have
ceased to pay interest in London save with
another lOU*. During the last three years
they borrowed 724 millions of good money
in London, and it all stayed there to cover
interest and to pay for oddments. Bull’s purse
being emptier than it has been within living
memory, he thinks of only lending part of
the interest, and asking for the rest in cash,
which will be an awakening.
An impression is bound to prevail that the
bright and fresh Lang (N.S.W.) Government
overdid things when, having a week or so of
the departed Fuller’s financial year to work
upon, it proceeded to pay, or charge up, all
possible items to him, thus furnishing a
deficit which could be thrown up at him, and
making the immediate future easier for it-
self. To make the June expenditure
£1,600,000 more than that of any previous
month in the year, and £2,100,000 more than
that of June, 1924, was hulking and clumsy,
also suburban and unconvincing. Tax-Com-
missioner Whiddon did his bit by informing
a number of taxpayers that they need not
pay till later, when their cheques would help
to swell Lang’s revenue instead of Fuller's.
His statement that he acted entirely by his
own volition is accepted without any doubt
whatever. But when a public servant does
a pleasing act for a Ministry which already
shows sign of having a very short way with
public servants who are not members of Our
Party, it is always wise to have the right
kind of volition.
The Mandates Commission of the League
of Nations has at last been able to consider
the annual report of the Australian man-
datory without being confronted with hostile
criticism from German-inspired sources. The
Nauru Administration has received an un-
accustomed pat on the back for the way it
is managing its show, and the news that
the Nauruians were running a branch of the
Commonwealth Bank on their own account,
as well as a co-operative store in competition
with European traders, was hailed at Geneva
as a great advance in native administration.
As a matter of fact, the Pacific Islander is
a born trader. Except where naturally easy
circumstances have removed the edge from
his appetite for a bargain, it takes a good
man to get the better of him. As in Nauru,
we may yet see native bank managers in
Papua. The chief drawback is that the
strong community sense of the Papuan may
make it difficult for him to refuse an over-
draft to his friends of the same village.
That liberty-loving institution the Mel-
bourne Trades Hall Council the other night
passed a resolution protesting against the
Commonwealth asserting its right to expel
undesirable immigrants from its territories.
After which the humorless body “resolved
that any Labor member who supported or
voted for the clauses should be expelled from
the party.” Ogden, the Tas. Labor Senator,
is the person for whom the apostles of
liberty are sharpening the sacrificial knife.
TACTLESS MR. WREN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Sydney City Council decided that a letter
from Mr. John Wren, offering to contribute £60,000
for street-improvement purposes if the resumption of
Park-street was not persisted in, should be merely
‘received.’ Several speakers characterised the offer ?s
an improper one, and there was some talk of referring
it to the City Solicitor. One speaker asked if
aldermen were to be continually subjected to this
sort of thing.”

“Wallaby”: South Melbourne’s once
famous joss-house has fallen Upon evil days.
Originally a handsome two-storeyed residence
standing well back from the street, it now
fronts a narrow lane, with consequent loss
of prestige. But the followers of Confucius
still own the valuable piece of land on which
the temple stands. Two weird-looking stone
creatures, each with a ball in its mouth,
guard the entrance; gilt Celestial lettering
adorns painted screens of red and blue; and
on the balcony two porcelain figures gaze

imperturbably on the uninviting landscape.
Gallantly throughout the years these hideous
custodians have withstood the shanghais of
sundry urchins. No one seems to know the
reason for the joss-house’s declining patron-
age ; but it was reserved for some local sports-
man to put the place to incredibly base uses.
Gloomy and secluded, it evidently struck
someone that it would make an ideal two-
up school, and it was actually commandeered
for this purpose until the local johns got
wind of the unlawful gatherings and inter-
fered. There is no means of knowing how
John Chinaman viewed this crowning act of
desecration.
“The Deacon”: The sea has been up to
its old tricks. During the recent stormy
weather off the Maoriland coast the steamer
Gale was getting so much the worst of it
in Cook Strait that the skipper decided to
run for Wellington again. In the flurry of
going about a wave swept the chief officer
overboard. A moment later another one
obligingly returned him, little the worse for
his immersion.

“Sauce”: The War Chest Club, a hostelry
for Diggers in Horseferry-road, London, had
a dubious reputation. Many Diggers spent
one night there; few risked a second. The
sleeping portion, a huge
barn-like room, con-
tained several hun-
dred beds, a few feet
apart. Experienced
campaigners put a leg
of the bed in each boot
before turning in, and
slept on the rest of
their kit, but even then
it was a case of ‘‘first
up, best dressed.” On.
the. night when I
patronised the estab-
lishment I woke from
a troubled slumber to
lind an outsize com-
rade-in-arms wobbling
about on my stomach
unwinding his puttees.
With a few words of
remonstrance, and both
feet, I induced the in-
vader to subside in a
graceful swallow-dive
to the floor. On regain-
ing his unsteady feet
he either dropped or
threw something under
the bed, and finally
flopped down, clothes
and all, on the adjoin-
ing one. He woke me
again early next morn-
ing to know if I had
seen anyone about his
bed, as he had lost his
wallet with 48 Brad-
burys in it. I promptlv
felt for my own; it
had gone, and several
others were loudly be-
wailing the loss of
articles o f uniform
and other personal
property. Then sud-
denly I remembered
that my neighbor
dropped something
under my bed when I
evicted him. We had a look; there was his
wallet untouched ; the thief had evidently not
thought it worth looking for anything in such
a poor hiding-place.

“Old Hand”: The re-gilding of Yic.
Assembly mace at a cost of five guineas re-
calls that the predecessor of the furbished-up
bauble disappeared mysteriously from the
Spring-street Parliament House 32 years
ago, when Matthew Davies was Speaker.
What became of it has never been ascertained
to this day. The yarn that it found a resting-
place in quicksands at a bayside suburb was
just about as true as the other 150 tales
broadcast at the time. Davison Symmons
got the scoop for the Argus from a friendly
sleuth who was trying to stimulate his de-
tective faculties by moistening his throat at
midnight at a city bar. Tommy Bent,
when he succeeded Davies in the chair,
officially reported that the mace was gone and
could not be located. A wooden affair served
to adorn the end of the table of the House
till 1902. when Speaker Frank Mason in-
duced Peacock (then Premier) to splash
£3OO on a new mace —the one just polished
up.

“Wai-lioi” : Many are the vagaries of the
J.P., but one I knew in the Northern Terri-
tory put up a record of his own. Before
him came a Chink charged with a trivial
offence. After administering a lecture his
Worship fined the offender £1 with costs,
casually adding, “With the money you owe
me for beef, that makes £3 17s. 6d. alto-
gether.” The Chinaman paid, but there was
such a kick-up over the business that Gil-
ruth, then Administrator, had the J.P.
knocked off the roster lest he might collect
any more overdue accounts that way.

“Flicker” : Stowaways? I may have helped
to save the life of one. On the troopship
Port Darwin, four days out from Colombo, a
mate and I were strolling the deck one night,
when we heard a continuous knocking just
under our feet. We reported to the officer
of the watch; a coal bunker was opened and
the most miserable-looking Cingalese I’ve
ever seen was extracted. His yarn was that
when coaling at Colombo he had fallen into
the bunker, lain stunned among the coal till
the ship was well clear of port, and had been
hammering on the door at intervals ever
since. He was made much of by the Diggers
who —mainly because he had six toes on each
foot —regarded him as a mascot, and would
have taken him with us into Egypt if
authority had not intervened. For four days
he had been immured without either food or
drink, and I’ve often wondered what would
have happened if we had coaled from the
port instead of the starboard bunker.
“J.R.”: I wonder if this accident ever
happened before. At the recent election in the
Speck a venerable voter, when depositing his
ballot-paper in the box, had the misfortune
to see his spectacles follow it. He approached
the presiding officer with the very natural
request that the box be unlocked and his

missing property restored, only to learn that
the regulations forbade the box being opened
until the poll was closed; so the hapless citi-
zen had to resign himself to an indistinct
view of the world for the rest of the day.
When the ballot-box was at last opened, he
was as much interested in the contents as
the candidates.

“Simon”: A few years ago the boss of a
department in one of the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Stores had a nervous breakdown and
was advised by his doctor to mix his work
a bit by way of relaxation. He did. He put
on overalls and heavy boots, took a bass
broom and rustled things about m the
reserve on the top floor for a. _ couple
of hours every morning. While he
was so engaged all hand's called him
“Dodds”; at all other times he was Mr.
Coxon. One morning a caller nosed in and
hailed him with a “Hi, Dungaree!” Dodds
took no notice. The caller became more
specific: “Which of you two’s the store-
man, you or the blanky broom?” It was
now Dodds’s turn, and he retorted with such
a burst of vituperation that the visitor, in
his hurry to report the insolent menial to
the boss, missed the lift and. took to the
stairs instead. Dodds saw the intention and,
with his overalls shed, was soon shooting
downwards in the lift. He just had time to
get into his office chair and look permanent
when the complainant was shown in. Lo
his utter bewilderment he was greeted from
the chair with “If you’ve come to report
Dodds, the storeman, for incivility, you’re
wasting your time. I know from experience
that you must have been offensive first..'’ And
the baffled caller passed out again wondering
liow in thunder “Dungaree” had got m first
with the boss.

“Quiz” : Even a house of worship lias be-
come an indifferent sanctuary these times.
Breathlessly entering a church in Williams-
town (Vic.) during a recent Sunday evening
service, a. young man sank with every ap-
pearance of reverent attentiveness into a
back pew. Several moments later another
man entered the building with similar de-
corum. and seated himself immediately be-
hind the first-comer. When the service ended
both men left together. Once clear of the
sacred portals, the second laid a heavy hand
on the shoulder of the first. The sleuth, it
transpired, had just caught sight of his
quarry as the latter disappeared into the
porch.
“X.N.0.”: I urn with ‘‘Bildud” all the
way in his defence (B. 25/6/’25) of the
“slovenly Spaniard” when it comes to town-
planning, and the allegedly degenerate Portu-
guese deserves a bouquet, too. Twenty-five
years ago Rio was a considerable town, but
it needed re-planning as much as Sydney
does to-day. The Brazilians sent for a town-
planner, gave him a free hand, and carried
out ruthlessly everything their chosen expert
suggested. If a house was in the way down
it came; if a hill was in the way down it:
came, too, and the earth and stones created
the reclamation which has given Rio the
finest wharves and waterside stores in the
world. The result is that Rio, in my opinion
—and I have seen a good many of the world’s
big cities—has no equal from whatever view-
point it is regarded. If a Rio building like
the Municipal Opera House is worth seeing
it has a space round it so that, unlike the
Queen Victoria Markets and even Sydney
Town Hall, it. can be seen. The roads are
wide, and those carrying much traffic are
double width, the two halves separated by
a continuous centre “island.” There are
trees everywhere, and every bay has its sea-
wall. Most of the buildings are at least 100
yards away, so that the inhabitants can see
for themselves that their harbor is there, in-
stead of only knowing it from the papers, as
most Sydney people do.
“Bouragi”: The damsel who thought the
growing olives in South Australia were
“young corks,” and asked when they would
be ripe (B. 25/6/’25), recalls a newly-
arrived missionary at Samarai. Someone
had brought down a lot of “wild rubber”
from the Mambare, and it had been turned
out of the bags on to the verandah of 8.-P.’s
store. This rubber is gathered from a vine
by the natives; after it has been dried they
roll it into rough little balls, not. unlike a
dried plum and much the same color. The
misli. blew along as we were regarding the
heaps, and made inquiries. Told that they
were wild rubber, he was much interested.
“Dear me,” lie said, “T had no ideah: do
these grow on the branches or the trunk
of the tree?” He may have been pulling our
legs, but I fancy he had been reading up
cocoa (not cocoa-nut) cultivation, then being
bruited in B.N.G.
* * * *
“Gouger”: It was two days after the Bir-
el-Abd stunt, and the fierce sun whipped the
crowns of distant sand dunes into shimmer-
ing tiers of light. In a far-flung line some
hundreds of us were cautiously scouting in
pairs long distances apart. From a rough
gully, drab with desert bushes, came the faint
wail of a mouth-organ. The tune was "Annie
Laurie.” Thoroughly surprised, my mate
and I turned our horses’ heads, and the hoofs
ploughed deep in the sand as the animals
rolled and stumbled down the hill. At the
bottom lay a Tommy, his head trying to cap
ture the shifting shade from a meagre bush.
His body lay in the sun-haze, with puttee-
bound bushes around his blood-stained thigh
to keep off the flies. The quavering notes
ceased as his blue eyes looked up in quick
apprehension. We could read his thought
plainly < “Turks!” And then the relief that
tried to smile from his sun-cracked lips as lie
saw instead two brown Aussies! He was
only a kid, a remnant of Kitchener’s army.
DUTY FIRST.
"Are you going to Australia for pleasures
“Heavens, no! I'm going out to join my
hushand!”
Hut lie was game. Two blazing days ol
thirst and nights of bitter cold and loneliness
he had spent there with his mouth-organ :
“Ah was afraid Ah’d go clean barmy.
Chooms, when mah lips cracked too much to
play,” he whispered when we’d emptied a
water-bottle down his throat.

THE HOLY CITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A purer city than Ballarat, with better residents,
t have never known.” — Mr. A. Nicholson, Chief Com-
missioner of Vic. police.
Bagdad and Tyre and Babylon,
Persepolis and Nineveh,
Though festive spots had nothing on
Some towns we read about to-day.
London’s as swift as swift can be,
Likewise Noo Yark and gay Paree.
The jazz band bangs, the cocktails fizz,
None heeds the writing on the wall;
Electric sky-signs blaze and whiz,
And throngs at Folly’s festival
Refill their cups at Pleasure’s vat.
Alone, aloof stands Ballarat.
Sydney is but one hectic glow,
Melbourne a whirl of dance and song.
We’ve heard dark hints of Bendigo,
And grave suspicions of Geelong.
And Adelaide —if tales are true !....
But Ballarat is ingenue.
A little drinking on the sly,
A little gamble in the street
Where starting-prices bookies cry,
And sports and cops in conflict meet—
Such brave adventures but uphold
Traditions from the age of gold.
In riot and luxuriance
Our tropic towns with mad desire
Whirl headlong in the sinful dance
To meet the fate of Koine and Tyre.
But Ballarat, the prophet knows,
Is pure and chaste among her snows.

“Elsie Ghee” : Melbourne’s latest fashion-
able weddings enjoyed all the vogue of a new
musical comedy. The leading ladies’ photo-
graphs were broadcast in the weeklies not
only when they became brides, but when
their engagements were rumored, when they
were announced, when wedding dates were
fixed and on any opportune occasion in be-
tween. The crowd at the church was like
that at the early doors of a risky drama,
with batteries of cameras and onlookers
treating the sacred edifice as something be-
tween a grandstand and a stadium; the
photographers’ only trouble was that the
front-rowers would not sit down when be-
sought. It seems only a step to the day
when a place like the Exhibition will be
engaged: bands will play, and there will
be tenders called for sideshow and cinema
franchises. A live entrepreneur, indeed,
might even purchase the showman’s right
and title in the affair*, whacking up proceeds
with impecunious young men picking up
wealthy brides.
* * * *
“Tabac” notes some changing methods: —
Sydney has had a change of coroner. Not a cheer-
ful iob at any time, but since old days things have
brightened up a bit—a clean court, no unclean
jurors, and decent post-mortems. Years ago when
medical men were supposed to be the proper material
for coroners, the court was held in a cramped and
not too clean room in the old Macquarie buildings
at the top of King-street. A motley "crowd of
“professional” jurors lounged outside the door —they
lived on the game in a close union. No outsider
NOT SAFE ON ITS OWA.
HE ( timidly ) : “It's wrong for a man to go through life alone."
SHE ( acidly): “Poor darling—won’t its mother chaperone it, then?”
got a look in. Nowadays jurors are seldom seen
at the court, and are only called for when a request
is made by a relative, an interested organisation or
by order of the Minister of Justice. Post-mortems
are held at the morgue where the body is viewed;
in the old days they had to be conducted on the
spot where the death occurred, if possible; if not
then at the nearest pub or any old place convenient.
Reform was precipitated by the case of a fat man
who committed suicide by taking prussic acid, which
has a specific action on the blood. When the
pathologist laid him out on the dissecting table oi
a floor in a pub, and got to work with the knife,
a spurt of blood shot up and damaged the ceiling
and woodwork of the room. The publican promptly
demanded damages from the Government. The claim
was met and orders given that in future all cadavers
were to be sent by ambulance to the Morgue, there
to be dealt with according to law and surgery.
* * . * *
“Nikko”: My only visit to a palmist was
made in company with a cousin predisposed
to scepticism. After long seeking we located
the seeress in a small, bleak house in a
back street, and were shown by a dejected
small girl into a fusty little parlor to await
Madame’s pleasure. During the wait a
tradesman called
unsuccessfully t o
collect .an account,
a lien strolled in at
the front door and
clucked inquiringly
at us, and a crowd
of shabby children
appraised us hun-
grily with a pathe-
tic suggestion in
their gaze that in
us they saw a solu-
tion of the dinner
problem. The scep-
tic showed symp-
toms o f restless-
ness, and presently
insisted on on r
withdrawal, despite
the assurances of
others of the party
that Madame’s
power to read the
future was extra-
ordinary. “Kead the
future!” she ex-
ploded indignantly
as we left. “Don’t
talk rubbish to me
about palmistry
and the future. Do
you imagine that
any woman able to see ahead would have let
herself in for that?”
“Piriti”: German-sounding names (B.
18/6/’25) were responsible on at least one
occasion for the N.Z.E.F. losing some good
soldiers. During the Somme battle of 1916
the brass-hats were perturbed by the deser-
tion to the Huns of a Maorilander of German
extraction. There was a hasty search through
the rolls for other German names, and any
unfortunate with a handle suggesting Teu-
tonic taint was marked down for immediate
deportation to England. The roll purifier
was apparently not well up in his job and
made some ridiculous mistakes. My own sur-
name, which is unusual, though thoroughly
English, was under grave suspicion, especi-
ally as my parents had fastened a German
Christian name to it, and I had to undergo
a searching cross-examination before I was
cleared. A cobber was not so fortunate. He
rejoiced in the Welsh name of Hinksmau,
and, despite his protests, “Hinky” was
hustled off with the others, calling on a long
line of Cambrian forebears to witness the
insult that had been put upon him. Eventu-
ally the hats saw reason in his case, but
Hinky refused to return to the line until an
apology had been sent to his parents.
* * * *
“Lai”: In the list of corrupted Australian
(N.S.W.) place-names (B. 18/6/’25) put
Ben Buckler. This
striking headland,
a boundary to the
favored beach o f
Bondi, was named
by Governor Mac-
quarie Benbecula,
from its close re-
semblance to an
island of that name
in the Outer Hebri-
des, of which group
he was a native.
“Dubbo” is another
distortion. A sta-
tion-owner, in the
early ’seventies,
built a residence
with a high-pointed
roof somewhat re-
sembling the crown
of a hat much in
favor in those days.
The abos. named
the place Thubbo,
meaning the crown
of a hat; corrupted
to Dubbo, it later
became the name of
the present town.
“Oxmead”: N.S.W. Speaker Dooley’s
action in discarding the official wig (B.
2/7/’25) was the reverse of that taken by
Tommy Walker, of W.A., when he secured
the same job in the rush for the spoils that
followed Collier’s accession to office. Tommy
re-introduced the antiquated horsehair which
Troy, Speaker in the previous Labor Admin-
istration (1911-16), had hurled aside with
some scornful remarks about mediaeval flum-
mery. In theory Labor is supposed to be
strongly opposed to all those superfluous
frills, but Walker’s dislike to wigs may have
been tempered by the fact that he is a
lawyer or the consideration that his own
thatch isn’t what it was —he owns to 60
strenuous years. Anyway, the wig, abolished
under W.A.’s second Labor Government has
returned under the third.

“J.11.D.”: It was at a city auction sale;
a score of miscellaneous paintings and a
few prints in frames had been put up in
various lots and knocked down, at an average
price of five shillings each. The last olfered

NOT CARRIED FAR ENOUGH.
“Her hat was a picture.”
“May have keen! But the rest of her was a sketch ?”
public custom, like the preceding works of
art, with a tentative “'Couple o’ bob to start
it?” from the auctioneer. But here the
resemblance ceased; imbued with what was
obviously a brisk spirit of competition, a
couple of dealers quickly ran the painting
up to £4. The auctioneer looked puzzled
and stopped abniptly. “An Old Master or
what?” he queried, adding to his assistant
who was holding the painting up to public
gaze, “Have a look, Bill, and see if there’s
a signature on it.” Bill inspected the pic-
ture earnestly, front and back, but could
find no name. “Funny,” commented the
man with the hammer. “Rub off the cata-
logue number in the corner. Any name
below that? Pen Boyd, eh? I thought those
two fellows knew something. Now, then
gentlemen, a Penleigh Boyd painting, and
I’m only offered £4.” He got £l6 before he
knocked it down.
* * * *
“Iford”: Australia’s old acquaintance, Sir
Gerald Strickland, has been attacked lately
by his opponents—his sometime Ex. always
had plenty of these: —because of his dual
Parliamentary position; he is a member of
the Maltese Legislative Assembly as well as
the House of Commons. It has not yet been
established, although It has been alleged,
that Strickland’s position is unconstitutional,
but it might certainly result in complications.
For that matter, there might easily have
•been legal questions raised in Australia
about John Forrest’s position when the big
Westralian was given an Imperial peerage,
and it is highly probable that constitution-
alists would soon have been busy arguing
about the dual role if Forrest had remained
an active politician instead of being a dying
man when the barony came his way. For in-
stance. in the U.K. a member of the House
of Lords is specifically debarred from taking
part in elections for the House of Commons,
and it is not clear that his right to do the
equivalent thing in a British Dominion might
not be fairly questioned. Strickland’s posi-
tion may be rendered a trifle more confusing
by the fact that he is a Maltese count as
well as two sorts of M.P., but counts are too
frequent in Malta to inspire any exaggerated
reverence.
* * * *
“Bill o’ Costs”: The remedy, mentioned by
“Clement It. D’Uppe” (B. 23/4/’25), of
roping in any bystanders the sheriff can lay
hands on to fill an incomplete jury is called
empanelling a talcs —that is, “so many” of
the bystanders as are needed, and the scratch
juror is called a “talesman.” An old-time
southern barrister (father of two living
K.C.’s, by the way) was fond of telling how
he was once briefed to appear in a far-back
court presided over by justices. He had
demanded a jury and in that remote region
any sort of juryman was scarce. Moreover,
as the case had been discussed by the locals
for a month or two, everyone was more or
less an avowed partisan. The action was
by a station employee against the owner,
and, as one side challenged all the squatters
and cockies and the other cut out all station-
hands and the like, the panel summoned was
exhausted with no one selected. “That about
settles you, don’t it, Mr. ?” said the pre-
siding beak with heavy jocularity. Mr. ,
who loved to pull a judicial leg as much as
any other, replied, “Not at all, your Worship.”
Then, screwing in his eyeglass, he put it
in his best Superior Courts of Westminster
style: “I pray a tales.” “You pray what?”
asked the staggered Bench. Mr. sol-
emnly passed up his copy of Roscoe’s Nisi
Prius with the appropriate passage for
perusal. Permission was given, but when the
purport of it dawned on the onlookers there
was a wild scramble of escaping eligibles
who didn’t want the job, and those yarded
were the obvious culls. His Worship sur-
veyed the catch disdainfully. “Are them the
sort of tails you prayed for, Mr. ?”
Counsel, who had to make the best of it,
answered that they seemed to him a highly
intelligent body of gentlemen, at the heads
of their respective callings. “No, they’re
not.” said the Court, “we know them better
than you do. They’re tails all right.” But
“tails” were what Mr. really wanted,
and he got his verdict.
“E.N.R.F.” : I notice from the cables that
at the centenary railway celebrations at
Darlington, England, the other day, the Duke
of York unveiled a tablet on the spot where
the first passenger ticket was sold. Nobody,
however, as far as can be gathered, pointed
out the exact place on the track where an
esteemed relative of mine, one Hutcheson,
was killed by the first engine of the first
train that, ever ran. For myself I’ve always
believed that my great-uncle sacrificed his
life to his convictions. An obstinate Tory
of the period—a Diehard of the old school—
he refused to believe that “the demnition
thing would move, sir,” and stood on the
track to attest his bona /ides. The engine
wasn't really much; but it won.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: The disappearance of the tall
and unsightly western wall of Government
House grounds in Adelaide recalls that it
was covered, during the war, with a Titanic
inscription, “Enlist! Enlist! We ai’e in grave
danger!” The story went that a dear old
lady, evidently under the impression that
Governor Galway had been out with the
paint-pot on behalf of his family, com-
mented : “Huh ! I don’t see that they are
in any more danger than anyone else.”
* * * *
“X.N.0.”: “J.A.E.” (B. 2/7/’25) is right;
neither “washout” nor “swinging the lead”
is a war product. The former in the It.N.
has always meant “finish,” “dismiss” or “no
score” (i.e., on a rifie range) or anything
else of the sort. It derives from the practice
of sponging or washing out the bore of a
gun after firing is over for the day. In
“Whispers from the Fleet,” published about
1906, Admiral Oradock, the subsequent vic-
tim of Yon Spee off Coronel, compares the
strict disciplinary method used by the gun-
nery officer: “Class, ’shun; dis-miss.” with
the awful method adopted by a torpedo officer
SO EASILY LICKED UP, TOO.
BLONDE ( referring to hero behind) : “Is he
your lover?”
BRUNETTE: “Oh no; merely a habit.”
on concluding a lecture to a class of young
subs., who were sent away with the words,
‘‘Righto; washout.” The second phrase pic-*
tures a leadsman in the chains who just
allows the lead to swing in a fore-and-aft
direction but never gives it the necessary two
complete cii’des over his head, and never, of
course, actually heaves it or gets a sounding
at all. The officer of the watch, glancing
over the bridge-rail at intervals, will always
find such a leadsman “swinging the lead”
but never doing any actual work. After the
lead has been hove as far ahead as possible
and a sounding obtained, the objectionable
part of the job consists in hauling it in again.
A “lead-swinger” never gets as far as that.
* * * *
“Common Plea”: It was a relative, pos-
sibly, of the woman voter with “Naturalist”
principles (B. 2/7/’25) who presented her-
self at the inquiry office of the Old Age and
Invalidity Pensions Department Sydney, the
other morning. “Oh please, sir,” she said to
the clerk at the counter, “please could you
tell me where I am to go for an infidelity
pension.” The clerk directed her to tlm
counter she had tried to indicate.
THE MIDNIGHT TRAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The street went up an’ the street went down, an’
I sloped like Wheeler’s Hill.
Oh, help!—a terrible night it was, and just on
midnight, Bill,
1 saw mesself in the cells all night, an’ up at the
court next day,
With the sergeant muttering ‘Drunk y’r Washup,’ and
general Hell to pay.
An’ then, just then, a tram buzzed by, an’ I grabbed
it, bold an’ neat—
The tram that turns the corner there at RusseU an’
Flinders street.”
Bill eyed his beer with a thoughtful air, and grinned
as he drained the glass,
And he dwelt awhile on the vision quaint of a
miracle come to pass.
“I hopped the tram, Bill, safe an’ sound, an’ I
rolled home, all 0.K.,
An’ here I am —yes, gimme a pint!—a free man
still this day!”
And then Bill said, as he turned his gaze on the
speaker, searching slow:
“But there ain’t no tram that turns around at
Bussell an’ Flinders —no!”
Jim stared at Bill with a long, cold stare, and “Wod-
didyersay?” he growled.
And Bill he gathered his glass again, and threw back
his head and howled.
“You blithering goat!” he roared, and drank, and
uttered a joyful neigh.
“The tram don’t go from Flinders round by Russell,
the way you say.”
Jim stared at Bill with a watery eye, and a hand
to his whirling head.
“Wosstliat?” lie muttered, and thought awhile. “Well,
it did las’ night!” he said.

In four years about a million tons of ore
have been taken out, and the best part of
£200,000 received from the outside invest-
ment of earlier savings, and all there is to
show are some worked-out stopes and losses
aggregating £176,778. So voices are raised
in demands that the mine be closed and
assets distributed. The Board has not de-
cided yet. It cannot be charged with timor-
ousness. It has fought hard to keep the
concern producing, and circumstances have
not helped. An extensive movement under-
ground between October 30 and November
5 was responsible for much of last year's
loss, mining exes, for the 208,557 tons of
ore raised being £318,309 compared with
£274,824 for the 242,021 tons raised in the
previous year. Last year’s loss was the
fourth running. When the abnormal de-
mand bred of war-time waste of metal and
war-time “prosperity” started to ease at the
beginning of 1921, the management found
that it cost more to work the ore to the ingot
stage than the gold- and copper were worth.
It was an impossible position ; and although
Premier Theodore was prepared to let the
taxpayers carry some of the load by rebating
£lOOO of railway freight per week, the co.
closed down. In March, .1922, work was
recommenced, the Government having in-
creased its subsidy _ to £llOO per week
and the unions having accepted a small
cut in wages. But meantime the quality
of the labor had fallen; and, though no
complaint was made on that score last year,
the heavy loss —£113,726 —on working
account is what is troubling a section of
shareholders, and not its causes. Taxes,
administrative exes, and depreciation allow-
ance brought the loss to £157,428, which re-
turns on investments (£86,823) and income-
tax refund reduced to £66,364. That refund,
although it belongs to earlier years, lias to
fit in • somewhere, but it makes last
year’s position look better than it really
was by £4241. Another slab of gloom which
may be put into the picture is that copper
stocks at the 1924 balancing date were 2018
tons, while on May 31 last they were 1387
tons. Following custom that was taken into
the accounts at £55 (the average price for
electrolytic for the year was £6B 13s. Sd.),
and it is plain that the true position was
improved by the surplus obtained on the 631
tons difference. That picks out the dark
spots. Here is a bright one:—

improved recovery costs money.
Gold is now a secondary consideration;
copper has long been the mainstay of the
mine. Early this year assistant g.-m. Hors-
burgh was sent to America to look up latest
methods of treating low-grade copper ores,
particularly reverberatory smelting. Tlors-
burgh has just returned. Much depends on
his report and recommendations. The direc-
tors propose visiting the mine “to investigate
the position fully on the spot, when the im-
portant question of continuing mining „and
treatment operations will be considered.
Known ore reserves on May 27 were
2,701,450 tons; but as roughly 25 p.c. of
ore mined of recent years has been from out-
side the mapped reserves, there is more than
10’ years’ supplies at recent rate of extrac-
tion. But both known and unmapped bodies
become unpayable when world prices for
copper fall to a low level. Last year electro-
lytic averaged £6B 13s. Bd.; in Jbly, 1914. it
was £6l, and at the close of 1918 £ll7. But
in July, 1914, costs were little more than
40s. a ton, while last year they were 725.,
working from the figures in the accounts.

Dawson Valley Colliery (Q.) is another
investment. Coal from it has released the
co. from much of its former dependence on
N.S.W. South Coast coke. Australian Fer-
tilisers absorbed Geo. Shirley and Elliott
Bros.’ fertiliser interests. Metal Manufac-
tures is producing electric cables, tubing and
wire. The net return of £86,828 from the
investments speaks plainly of their pros-
perity. Those net assets had a value (blister
at £55) equal to just on 15s. per share. And
there is the mine and plant in the books at
£1,115 300 less £435,666 written oft,
2.701,450 tons of known ore reserves of 2.61
p.c. copper and 6dwt. gold and one of the
completest plants in the world. But the
value of mine and plant is governed by the
copper market, which is completely out ot
the Board’s control. The Stock Exchanges
see verv little hope. Recent sales were made
at ss. 6d. and there was a quote this week

A further 100,000 ordinaries were issued to
shareholders at par during the year, and
rauk for dividend as from the beginning of
the term lately begun. Needless to say, the
issue was oversubscribed. A like number
was issued in 1921. Shareholders will call
for another £lO,OOO this year (the 10 p.c. has
been so regular that, barring a catastrophe,
it may be taken for granted), but the task
should be very simple judged by disclosed
profits since the public became interested, m
1915. Last year, for instance, 30 p.c. of
net visible earnings was sent to reserves,
which on April 30 amounted to £209.754.
There was a gift issue of £50,000 in 1920
and the market is looking for further sweets.
Apart from such expectations the scrip has
been popular from the day of listing on
’Change. The balance-sheet figures give
most of the reason :
1915. 1921. 1924. 1925.
Paid capital .. £340,740 £490,740 £490.740 £590,740

Cash and invest-
meats .. 17,348 122,406 196,224 268,32.1.
The effect of the new capital, all of which
had been received prior to the close of tL’c
accounts, is visible in the changes. r l hose
figures will be altered as the year progresses,
and doubtless much of the new money will
go in advances: the management, which is a
liberal backer of likely customers, has been
financing printers more extensively since
capital which was bound up in high-priced
stocks in the boom period has been released.
There has been a steady diminution in the
figure at which stocks appear in the books.
Last year’s figure was a further low record,
despite an increased turnover, which gener-
ally, although not necessarily, is accom-
panied by heavier stocks. The position sug-
gests that it is in stocks that the co. is build-
ing up a substantial inner reserve by drastic
writing down in book values. According to
the report stocks are in “at replacement cost
or less, and provision has been made for any
further decline in market value.” The ten-
dency during the year was downwards —lead-
ing lines of paper sold 5 p.c. lower —and the
Board appears to have made lavish allow-
ance. The hard-working Board, by the way,
consists wholly or almost wholly of the heads
of the business; and the establishment wears
no frills.
The position on April 30 was very solid:
to meet current trading liabilities of £131,868
there were cash, Government securities and
shares in other cos. amounting to £268,321.
And the assets other than stocks had without
a doubt been looked at conservatively. Dur-
ing the year a new warehouse in Melbourne
and an additional area adjoining the Bris-
bane freehold were purchased. The only
feature which the management considers dis-
turbing is the proposed commercial treaty
with Canada. At present a large quantity
of paper is imported from England, but that
position will change if the treaty is finalised.
Meantime the market is holding its scrip
pretty tight and hoping for an early pleasant
surprise.

That recent record looks good and much
better than the record of previous years,
when occasional big profits made one sus-
picious of speculative dealings. In the past
three years, only £4478 of the total profit
of £11.578 has been distributed ; and, though
the div. rate has been but 6 p.c., it has
really been double that to old holders, be-
cause of the 1921 capitalisation. I urther,
so far as one can see, the co. hasn’t had to
take heavy risks to do all this: —■

Shares in other cos., etc. — 1,280 22,900 2t>,193
The co. was leaning on its bankers on
April 60 for £25,230; on its limited capital,
even though aided, by substantial accumula-
tions, it was impossible to build and fit freez-
ing works, etc., without assistance. On April
30 last the item was £43.20S “at cost, "
less depreciation of £13,048. Apparently
during the past few years there have been
some sales of property, which explains part
of the shrinkage. Debtors are moderate at
£19.649, while shares are held in the Co-
operative Insurance Co. of Australia (£7500)
the Co-operative Box Co. of 5 ictoria
(£16.510) and £660 in unspecified concerns.
Altogether, the position is comfortable
enough, and with present promising condi-
tions in the primary industries the outlook
is bright.

Vs in the previous year the co. laid off large
blocks of its risks, otherwise things would
have looked very blue. As it was, despite
this re-insurance, the underwriting experi-
ence was unpleasant. The trouble came from
the marine branch; in the preceding term
heavy fire claims took the burnish off lesults.
It was the third consecutive year to show
underwriting losses: —

1995 47,181 33 950 13,107 71.9 „ 27.8 „
The surplus of £4OOl shown for the year in
the first table was not profit, of course:
increased business necessitated increased
cover for unexpired risks, and tbe interest on
investments did little more than meet under-
writing losses. What could be considered
strictly as the year’s net profit was £I.W,
and rather than transfer money from the
general reserve to pay a div., the Board added
the small sum to the balance at 1 .
and L. The reserve for unexpired risks (it
is included in the reserves of the introduc-
tory table) was maintained at 40 p.c. or
the net premium income in the Fire and
Accident and the usual 15 p.c. on cargo
and 50 p.c. on hulls in the Marine de-
partment. But in addition was a general
reserve of £7500 plus the undistributed
balance, £2353. Witli funds thus amounting
to 184 p.c. of the year's premium income, the
co.’s strength was well over what is usually
considered adequate.
The Pacific was established by J. M. Hed-
strom. Henry Marks and A. B. Joske, the
“Big Three” of Fiji, in December, 1010. It
was a clean float. Preliminary exes, were
written off out of the first year’s profits,
and the accounts are free from establishment
account: even such items as furniture and fit-
tings and stationery have been written out. As
funds have increased they have been placed
in gilt-edged securities. The expansion lias
been consistent: gross premiums last year
were £05,003 compared with £80,027 for
1024 and £67.163 in 1023. Although out-
goings have been heavy—-90.7 last year,
1.01.4 in 1024 and 103.3 in 1023 —expenses
have been uniformly light; they showed a
decrease of 5.7 p.c. last year. The good com-
mercial connection of those principally in-
terested in the co. makes the outlook bright
for still further increases in business. And
since last year’s heavy marine losses were
almost all on first-class risks (the co. was
interested in the steamers Armagh, Clan
McMillan, Kaikoura, Strathlorne, Port
Nicholson, Leitrim and City of Singapore).
there seems every likelihood of shareholders
getting a run of good divs. under normal
conditions. The foundations certainly have
been well and truly laid.

so much that the teeth-carpenters of M.L.

ing a hand, despite the semi-co-operative

ment was satisfactory in those matters, the
future looks brighter, for “the turnover for

and tested by British firms, including Beard-
more and Karriers Motors, Ltd. A locally-
built engine fitted to a chassis completed
24,000 miles over S. A. roads at a reported
cost of 16s. 6d. for three new gudgeon-pins.
Norman Darling installed an engine m his
speed-boat and “did” 25 m.p.li. Now comes

Nominal capital is £250,000 in £1 shares.
Wege Motor, Ltd., is to be allotted 10 p.c.
of the issued capital: the directors may pro-
ceed to allotment when 20.000 shares have
been applied for. Vendors receive no cash

Royal Commissioner Kingsley Thomas’s
criticism of the Ivalgoorlie mining cos. and
their works is what The Bulletin expected
from the hints he dropped. Some of his con-
clusions arc overdrawn, and almost suggest
the prosecutor rather than the judge. He
found there has been “tx great laxity of con-
trol,” an attitude of “inertness, inactivity
and inability to grapple effectually with pro-
blems as they arise.” He discovered lack
of attention to detail and lack of control,
and “stagnation, drift and apathy.” Further,
the general appearance of the mines on the
surface gave him “an impression of desola-
tion, despair and ruin.” Things are better
than that, although in some cases there has
been in recent years a tendency to “live in
the glories of the past.” Thomas recom-
mends the amalgamation of the seven pro-
ducing mines on the Golden Mile, with cen-
tral power and treatment plants, That, of
course, is what has been urged on this page
unceasingly during the past seven years.
The excuse for not doing it has invariably
been that mining on the field has “gone too
far” to justify the “scrapping” of existing
plants and the installation of others. Seven
managers, seven mine staffs, seven London
Boards, seven everything that goes to
the working of a mine except modern
appliances and labor-saving machinery and
an appreciation of up-to-date mining practice
—this is the picture that Thomas presents
of Kalgoorlie. But he is wrong when he
imputes to the mine managers (though he
makes two exceptions) responsibility for
“this attitude of inertness, inactivity and in-
ability.” Mining policy is directed from
London, not from Kalgoorlie. Had the local
managers been free agents, lots of things
which have been left undone would have been
done. It is the London directors who have
to be convinced of the need for amalgama-
tion and the “scrapping” of plants, etc., and
so far, except in the cases of the Oroya
Links, Ivanhoe and Chaffer’s, they have been
opposed to anything of the kind.
Kalgoorlie is not the be-all and end-all of
Westralia’s gold-mining industry in the
opinion of Royal Commissioner Thomas. He
believes that with ample capital and scien-
tific methods there arc good prospects on
other fields. He reckons that Wiluna offers
“great possibilities,” but that the present
scale of exploration is “singularly in-
adequate” ; at Menzies further development
is recommended; at Meekatharra there is
“a long line of lodes and quartz veins which
warrant further investigation”; at Day
Daivn the Gt. Fingall “offers encouragement
for further inquiry”; at Norseman the old
Mararoa mine, which was abandoned by the
Mararoa Co. some years ago and which has
been successfully worked by a local syndi-
cate ever since, is a property, “worthy of in-
vestigation in view of the size and perma-
nence of its reef.” Even at Coolgardie
Thomas was impressed. He doesn’t believe
that this down-and-out field is finished, and
suggests that diamond-drill bores be put
down in likely places to prove the principal
gold-occurrences at depth. Dealing with
labor in the West, he asserts that its
ciency is lamentably low, and that it is “not
so much the wages that bear heavily on
the mining cos. as the return in work for the
wages.” He adds: “What proportion of the
low standard of efficiency is due to ineffi-
cient labor and what to inefficient appliances
and lack of discipline I leave to those in-
terested to determine.” Apparently Thomas
found the problem too knotty to solve.
* * * *
Kalgoorlie has hopes of the old Boulder
No. 1 mine, surrendered by the ill-fated
Boulder No. 1 Co. last year, becoming a con-
sistent gold-producer. Latterly a local syn-
dicate has, by selective mining, been doing
well, and is now opening up a fair-sized
shoot at a depth of 360 ft., which is said to
have every appearance of permanency. Mean-
while Boulder No. 1 Co., which gave up this
property to look for one “worth attention,”
is growling at the high prices asked for
undeveloped slums.
* * * *
Hampton Celebration (W.A.) is again
being worked. Present operations include
further development at 400 ft. where pros-
pects are considered fair, and the deepening
of the shaft to 600 ft., where it is hoped
values will prove a source of profit to the
co. It is possible that exploration at these
points will expose sections of good stuff, but
success hangs by a very slender thread.
“General Oil Seeker” :
J. L. Strevens (B. 28/5/’25), in speaking to His
brief about the chances of finding oil in the Glenelg
River district (Vic.)i blundered about the amount of
drilling and surveying done there. It is because the
territory has been well drilled and widely that Mclntosh
Reid, State Geologist of Tasmania, was able to
speak hopefully about the ultimate discovery of oil.
From the Coorong to the Glenelg River much good
work has been done and a large amount of capital
spent in boring. Here is a list of bores not before
published. The grandfather borehole of the lot was
put down at Alfred Flat to 922 feet in 1883.
Subsequently a hole was bored by an Adelaide
drilling co. about three miles north-west of that
bore which stopped at 932 ft. Neither of them
bottomed on ordovician rocks, both leaving off in
the tertiary strata through lack of funds. At Black-
ford, east of Kingston on Lacepede Bay, a hole
stopped at 1365 feet. South-east and nearer Kings-
ton, Tom Whaley drilled for the Southern Ocean Co.
to 1170 ft. The S.A. Oil Wells Co., the only concern
which has properly tackled the search for oil, not
far from Robe, took about three years to get down
to 4504 feet, and did not reach bedrock. Its second
bore, near Tantanoola, was thrust down to 1502 ft.
and unfinished. The Associated Oil Corporation sank
a hole to 960 ft. not far from Mount Gambier. The
Coorong Oil Co. at Salt Creek delved to 930 ft.,
and the S.A. Oil Wells Co. is plugging away, just
east of the Victorian border with excellent prospects.
The tertiary deposits of Australia have not yet been
properly drilled for petroleum with proper plant
by competent men. Evidently, Strevens, like a
number of other oil seekers, thinks that potholes put
down to 1000 or 2000 feet are sufficiently deep to
prove or deny the existence of petroleum. With
experience equal to his, may one ask The Bulletin
to believe that not one borehole in Australia has
been bored deep enough, say to 5000 or 6000 feet,
to tell the truth about our oil deposits? So far,
barring the Robe borehole at 4504 ft., we have
been bothering about on top with rotten machinery
and worse geological advice. But we are learning,
and I hope ,one day to announce in The Bulletin
that oil has been struck in Australia very deep down.

Amalgamated Zinc hangs in the balance.
All that is being done at the moment is to
clean up the zinc sales of the past, get what
it can for its Broken Hill mill and collect
dividends from share holdings in Electrolytic
Zinc and Mineral Separation and De Ravays.
Last half-year brought in £15,751 from them ;
this with £2623 from excess of realisations
over, valuations of concentrates and £7203
from interest, etc., gave sufficient to provide
another shilling for shareholders. Moreover,
a good start was made for another distribu-
tion of the same amount, as £16,500 has since
turned up from Risdon find £2756 from flota-
tion. If the co. was to go into liquidation,
as some hungry souls suggest, there would be
a fair bit to cut up, for on Dec. 31 last,
against liabilities stood the following easily
realisable assets: —
Stores and products .. .. £25,138
Sundry debtors .. .. 12,077
Deposits, interest and debs... 239,893
Cash 8,145 ,
Total £285,253
As liabilities are £55,585 there is a surplus
of £229.668 of tip-top assets apart from the
holdings of 300,000 ords. of Electrolytic Zinc,
and 83,250 ords. and 36,000 profs, of Mineral
Separations and De Bavays. Oddments of
other shares may or may not be worth
putting into the waste-paper basket; that
only is known in Shackell’s office. Nothing
is told by the Board as to what has been the
outgo upon the Tasmanian paper project,
though it must have cost a lot more than
6d. to send Dave Avery to London and for the
experiments in England and Holland to de-
cide whether pulping and paper manufacture
can be carried out successfully with_ the
Speck’s hardwoods. Then, too, a technician
from one of the Armstrong Whitworth sub-
sidiaries has been brought hither to see if the
Speck’s forests are as mapped out by Collins
House. He is favorable; Avery is certain.
Hence this recommendation by the Board fo
shareholders :
The gentlemen above mentioned, having thoroughly
investigated the proposition on the manufacturing side
and by an inspection of the timber areas, factory
sites and other relevant features in Tasmania, have
no hesitation in recommending that this co. should
proceed w'ith the undertaking, and they advise that
the favorable conditions attendant on the timber areas
secured to the co, and the available features essential
for technical success and commercial success are
such that it is unlikely that the same will again be
found together in Australia.
Every rose bus a thorn. The little point
showing through is the “newsprint free of
duty” item in the reciprocity agreement with
Canada. Monty Cohen and his associates
want a bounty first, and then a duty of 40 p.c.
to give the Australian paper project its
show. The orehardist requires wider markets
if he is to stop on the land. To get free
entry into Canada seems to him a fine thing.
But the Canucks won’t have reciprocity if
they can’t get their paper in free. Is the
fruitgrower to win, or will Collins House
succeed V
Woods Point (Vic.) went back when
George Dickenson tripped to London. He
thought that things were in train for a fan-
run of stone at the Morning Star, but the
mountains played him false, as they have
done everyone who has trusted them too long.
The going was good while it lasted, and
the Mine’s advance of £lO,OOO was justified.
It was wiped out, and £27,000 in divs. given
to the sporty crowd that hang on the mining
tips of Dickenson. Now, unfortunately, in-
stead of tonnages of pay ore being exposed
to give the battery a duty of 2000 tons a
month, the quantity available for the stamp-
ers has slumped to zero. So calls are the
rule. The A 1 programme of sinking to pick
up fresh floors of quartz has been adopted,
but a halt was called at 920 ft., as calls were
not blossoming as freely as formerly. At
the moment £3.600 a month is being blown
into the mine in quest of a make of gold.
Most of the work is on the western wall of
the big dyke, the hope being that a shoot of
ore will materialise below the spot where the
old Age of Progress formation made the
basin famous. Some boring is to be done on
the eastern side of the dyke, and by the end
of the year it will be known whether the
Morning Star has guttered or not.
* * * *
The fall of copper below £6O forced Lyell
to reduce on the mining side. Thirty men
were paid off last pay, and another batch
will probably have to go.
The Minister for Mines is helping the Stan-
hills tinfield (N.Q.). He has just paid a
visit and returns much impressed with pros-
pects. The 10-head battery, for which he
granted assistance, will soon be ready for
crushing. A geologist is to be sent to the
field to assist and advise prospectors who have
recently gone there, as well as to furnish a
report general! v on the field. New leases
are being taken up on the strength of glow-
ing reports broadcast as to a couple of the
prospects, and there is a growing feeling in
some quarters that the Mauretania is one
of the most promising shows in the North
and may emulate the Vulcan.
■* * * ■*
Lawn Hills (N,Q.) has 20 or 30 men
prospecting and raising ore. This is the
largest number that has been on the old
field for many years. Although a gouger s
field, under present conditions of isolation
it is not an attractive proposition. There
are some rich shows, and conditions are not
too bad, but it costs a mint to get mining
stores and provisions there, and freight eats
up at least half of the value of high-grade
ore. The Silver King and others have exposed
some clean galena veins and lenses which
-under ordinary conditions would delight the
heart of the gouger. However, they are on
the low side in silver, and that, combined with
the crippling freight to Burketown and then
steamer freight on top, will keep this field
under. If it ever gets a railway it will
certainly be heard of.
Havenswood (Q.) crushed in June 122
tons for 5070 z. smelted gold, and the crush-
ing also produced 40 tons concentrates and
sludge. Total value, £2800; or £23 per ton.
This co. keeps up its high returns, but ton-
nages have been small lately: 140 ft. of sink-
ing and 240 ft. of levels produced no stone of
any value, as the shaft is away from the shoot
of gold. Latest reports, however, make the
future more promising, as both the bottom
levels have picked up good stone. The south
level has 6in. of lOoz. stone, and the north
sin. of Boz. stone, and both are improving.
The last six months showed a profit of £398
only, but much development work was done
and paid for during the term. This is the
co. that shocked the Q. Mines Department
by paying back the whole of its advance.
Recently £lOOO was placed at fixed deposit
and £lOOO in the Savings Bank—no doubt to
build up a reserve to provide for the rainy
day that comes to most mining cos. As the
present is the first time the co. lias had a
block of stone each side of the shaft, it looks
certain that tonnages will be greatly increased
before the end of the year.

“Sol”: When hysteria took full possession,
a section of the Sydney press recently burbled
in large type that the owners of a pothole at
Lucknow stood to win “the reward of
£10,000” offered by the N.S.W. Government
for discovery of a new field. There is no
such reward. The Mines Department offers
£lOOO provided the new mineral field is 10
miles from any other, and that within two
years 200 miners have been “profitably em-
ployed” on the line of lode or within a
five-mile radius. An addendum gazetted last
April awards a maximum of £5OO for a
discovery within a mile of a former field or
mine, provided that £2OOO worth of mineral
is obtained within 12 months.
Flagstone Tin, Emmaville (N.S.W.), has
purchased at a big discount the 10-head mill
at the Butler mine, about 12 miles away.
The plant cost £5OOO when erected eight
years ago, and has crushed only 4000 tons
for the Melbourne syndicate which bought
the Butler pup. There will at least be no
Jack of provender at the Flagstone, and it
McKenzie’s values are corroborated the mill
has many years ahead of it when removed
to its new address. Some vein stuff brought
to Sydney last week contained 60 p.c. tin

paid to £2 for battery purposes. If agreed
to, this will place the nominal capital at
£30,000 in 6000 £5 shares.

Bribbaree (N.S.W.) got 1550 z. from as
many tons for the June crushing, but the
cyanide plant still awaits completion. No. 1
n.-w. level picked up the quartz again in a
crosscut 16ft. into the footwall. The stopes
above are in 6in. to 24in. of medium ore.
Nos. 2 and 3 s.-e. levels are both in a bad
way. No. 2 has two men stoping on “an
irregular reef from 3in. to 6in. fair to medium
quality ore.” No. 3 had its “3in. of poor
ore” displaced by a fault at 140 ft. from the
shaft.

Adelong Estates dredge, dealing with
310,500 c. yards of better-grade wash, got
the average up to Old. a yd., but was helped
by a 15:}d. patch in November, and 13d. dirt
in the January-February runs. Surprises
of the kind have made the co.’s profits for
the last two or three years, and the regret
of Collins House is that the same stuff cannot
be expected for another decade. Just now
the dredge is working out of a poor spot,
but with lOd. bores ahead returns will allow
Bill George to go to the Cup. Grades all
round went Id. better than during the pre-
vious campaign, and by netting £4883 the
co. could splash another shilling div. The
worst of having to stick to an old plant is
that it eats up cash for repairs and mainten-
ance : £3247 went that way against £2900
for six months’ wages. The Estates has
£11,225 with which to face adversity.

An inverted wowser :
J. S. Langley, who is at present preaching evolu-
tion to Sydney, is an interesting study in evolution
himself. Destined for the church, he was waylaid
at the very portals in his English undergraduate days
by some literature of the Rationalist Press Association.
His conversion was as rapid as Abu Bekir’s, who,
when he denied Islam, was flicked by Mahomet’s
little Anger into the sky. He went up an infidel and
came down a believer. Going to Perth (W.A.),
Langley galvanised the moribund Rationalist Associa-
tion of that city into temporary life hy his missionary
zeal. In cne of his debates, presided over by the
late Montague Miller—who was at the Eureka
Stockade the morning after the fight . and who lived
to stand his trial for being mixed up with the
I.W.W. during the Great War—he faced a young
army chaplain. The confident man of God was
sybaritic-looking in military uniform and decorations,
while the rationalist was a gloomy fanatic in dingy
serge. To the astonishment of the parson, the
despised outsider quoted not only Scripture,’ but
Greek and Roman authors in the original. Subsequent
attacks on clericalism nearly led to riots in which
the orator’s sole line of defence was the odd police-
nian he could summon from the nearest beat. When
the impassioned Langley left Perth for Melbourne,
rationalism in the former city died immediately.
Ned Harney, K. 0., the eloquent Irishman
who sits in the attenuated Liberal party of
the House of Commons as member for South
Shields, had three shots at Parliament in
Australia. The first was in 1597 when he
was at Coolgardie. The young lawyer at first
aspired to represent the “Old Camp” in the
Vi .A. Assembly, but the supporters of A. E.
Morgans, who wanted their man to have a
clear run against “Smiler” Hales, managed
to divert him to Esperance, where a better-
kuowu local candidate was preferred. Four
years later Harney got his chance at the first
federal elections, and was returned fifth on
the list of W.A. Senators. But he soon be-
came unpopular owing to his habit of leaving
Ins Parliamentary job and taking steamer for
I romantic whenever a fat brief beckoned,
and lie didn’t stand again in 1903. Two years
later he made another attempt to enter the
State Parliament by offering his services to
< rreenough ; but his fiorid perorations failed
to tickle the ears of the Cocky groundlings,
who returned Pat Stone, reasoning that he
knew more about fertilisers and noxious
weeds that any K.C. could be expected to
know. Three or four years later Harney
bade good-bye to Australia.

As Alec Nicholson, Vic. Police Commis-
sioner, will either not return to duty at all

course, Warren, who is just on 60, would
retire at the end of July, but it won’t do
to leave the force headless. There is an im-
pression that the top-clerk, Heathershaw, is
the power behind the throne, whoever is
nominal ruler. He was temporary chief
while Edward P. was whirling through Vic.
five years ago.
"Sucre”: Mention (B. 2/7/'25) of the
retirement of Barnes, of Canning Downs,
Warwick, beckons my memory back to days
when Canning Downs was the swellest of
outh Queensland stations. There resorted
the Windeyers, the Wildashes and the Mac-
anslis, all merinos of the finest fleece. Others
who made merry at Canning Downs were the
Leslies, the Chauvels (Palestine knows Harry
Chauvel’s fame), the Mackays of South Tool-
burr, the Slades of Glengallan. the J. D.
Smytlies, Captain Daveney, the Margetts,
the Pollards, Chas. E. Bright (now
serang of the postal service, who married

Bill I£ erme dy, of Melbourne Herald, and
11. Drakard, of the Age, have joined Vie.
Hansard staff. . Up till two years ago
Kennedy was private sec. to Vic. Minister
for Public Works. He took to journalism
like a duck to water. Drakard. a coinpara-
tively recent importation from S.A., was in
charge of the Age’s law-court staff, and is
a crack Pitmanite. He passed the licensed

his spare time he is general treasurer of

There were few busier men in N.S.W. 30
years or so ago than William Archer, who
died at Burwood on Monday, aged 94. He
was six years in N.S.W. Assembly, 47 years
in the Burwood Municipal Council (several
times Mayor), and as a railway contractor
he was responsible for the Wallerawang-
Rydal section of the western railway. A
cheerful soul was “Old Bill,” and cheerful
he remained even when blindness descended
upon lum in his declining years.
H.K. : This looks like an even more
complicated matrimonial web than that
woven around that old-time Tasmanian
champion cricketer Eady (B. 2/7/’25) A
storekeeper in a N.S.W. western township
is married to his son’s wife’s mother. Thus
the son lias acquired a mother-in-law who
is also his step-mother, a wife who is his
fathers step-daughter and daughter-in-law,
and a father and step-father in one.
Candidates of the past:—
The modern candidate for Parliamentary honors is
either a bit warier or better-informed than his pre-
decessor of 20 or 30 years ago; he seldom falls so
hard at question-time. Half a dozen years before
Australia federated, a person who looked like (and
possibly was) an undertaker uprose at a Sydtiev
meeting and demanded to be told if the would-be
legislator on the platform was in favor of cremation.
The candidate looked puzzled for a moment, and then
his eye lit up with understanding. “Yes, 1 am,” he
dec!aied boldly, “but”—with the air of one deter-
mined to be perfectly frank—“l draw the line at
Imperial cremation!” It was a would-be Westralian
statesman-—he afterwards became an M.H.R.—who
pledged himself, if returned, in response to a chal-
lenge that he lacked the necessary gameness, to
advocate a tax on all land, including Crown land.”
But the most embarrassing inquiry I ever heard
boomed from the back of a crowded hall was addressed
to an orator of hardshell Tory views, and, to put i,
mildly, allegedly Brigham Young ish proclivities. He
had just concluded in response to Query No. 1 a
logical summary of the considerations which made
him range himself as an opponent of One Man
One Vote, when Query No. 2 arrived like a thunder-
bolt out of the clear sky. “And now,” pursued the
seeker after information relentlessly, “tell us if
jou le in favor of One Man One Woman.” Five
minutes must have elapsed before the chairman’s re-
quest that somebody would move a vote of thanks
was audible above the glad uproar.
A further step up is to bo taken next
month by Alan
Rowe, who was
honorary curator
of the Adelaide
Museum and lec-
turer in archaeology
to the W.E.A. of
S.A., until in 1022
he went off to

fine old couple, who have no family, have
given a recreation hall to Shelford, and hand
out cheques to deserving objects all round the
Geelong district. The Commander even car
ned quixotism so far as to finance for some
years a daily paper of “correct” view’s, and
he provided one of the earliest cheques for

Of interest to Maorilanders is the cabled
news that a retired schoolmaster named
Grant, over 70 years of age, is claiming the
earldom of Seafield. The present holder of
the title, according to the cable, is the
Countess of Seafield, a Maorilander; but this
is incorrect. The story of Maoriland’s con-
nection with the earldom goes back to 1882
w hen the fifth Lari died. The sixth, seventh
eighth and ninth holders of the title all
succeeded and pegged out between ’B° and
98; in that year the title fell upon a Grant
who, after being in the Navy, emigrated
to Maoriland and there became in turn
laborer, farmer and member of the legisla-
ture. He wore the Seafield coronet for six
months, and then swapped it for a halo the
earthly bauble going to his 21-year-old’son.
This Grant, born and bred in M.L., married
a daughter of Dr. Townend. a Wellington
medico. In 1915, being then 38, he was killed
in the war. By special royal dispensation his
nine-year-old daughter succeeded to the title
as Countess of Seafield. This voung miss
now 19, and not her M.L. mother, is the
one whom the old schoolmaster is trying to
displace.
REINCARNATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
1 heard the bagpipes playing last night as I lay
abed;
The Highland club was nestling scarce a furlong
from mv head.
The wild, weird pagan music played havoc within
my brain.
And my previous incarnations brought me my youth
again.
1 was equerry to Wallace and 1 polished the helm
of Bruce,
lighting the war-worn English with never a cry
of truce.
Battle-axe, spear and truncheon and the weapons of
pagan man
AVere moulded all in my fountain-pen to sing ot
my mother clan.
Oeep in a Highland fastness a stream that made
dancing rhyme
Brought me my first sea-longing when Raleigh was
in liis prime.
Brake and the sons of Devon who feared not the
ruthless sea,
Brought me unscathed through the icons and paved
the way for me.
Down to the Horn that spares not in ships that
were small and frail
AVcnt men who were aye resourceful, men who knew
not to fail.
Fighting the sea for a living and nursing- no vain
regret.
They made the ocean an open road—and the sea
is England’s yet!
1 heard the bagpipes playing, spatlispey and reel
and fling,
Sassenachs spitting their venom to poison a -Scottish
king!
And the old-time blood of my fathers surged swift
in my modern veins
At. the wheel and whirl, and the squeal and skill
and the bagpipes’ doleful strains.
But I was born in Australia, the land that I hold
most dear—.
Still the old-time spirit comes surging through the
ages year by year.
1 heard the bagpipes playing and the nates were
wondrous sweet,
As I „ 1 la r'’ close b - v the Hi elan’ club that nestles in
Philup-street!

“Hardaiidry": “Nicauor” (B. 4/6/’2o) is
light when he says 127 degrees is not a record heat
tor Australia. I remember one day in January
about 1906 in the Cunnamulla district (Q.) when
the glass event to 128 and some points—I forget
how many. Some Abo. readers might remember
two bagmen perishing from heat and thirst on the
road between the Widgee pub and Cunnamulla. The
same day I was dispatched to save a lot of wethers
which were perishing in a comer of a paddock.
Making an extra-early start, having about 10 miles
to go, and expecting to get water in an iron tank
at an old rabbiter’s camp, I found on arrival that
it was bone dry. After going a little further the
dog threw in the towel and was dead before 7 o’clock
in the morning. The day took its full toll of birds
also. They were lying dead under the trees every-
where. After punching the woollies seven miles I
reached water at half-past two in the afternoon
with a swollen tongue and ears singing like a hive
of bees. The sandflies that came after the big wet
that followed nearly wiped out the kangaroos in
the district, besides killing thousands of lambs and
weaners.
“Bamahoota”: “Yarrunx”. (B. 11/6/ 25)
eulogises the Wellington (X.S.W.) scnoolboys’ cricket-
bats, home-made from the local willow-trees. Asa
kid attending the Tambaroora public school —one of
the seven structures which are all that now remain
in a once thickly-populated goldfield—cricket-bats as
used by Collins and Gilligan were treasures possessed
only by the local cricket club. This didn’t worry
the champions of the morrow, as a length taken
from the butt of an old acacia-tree touched up with
a spokesliave proved a wonderful success. Two oi
these bats had four years’ work and hit countless
“boundaries,” and it was with a wistful smile that
1 greeted them a few weeks ago after 30 years.
They still stand in the corner where I used to leave
them after school, and I reverenced the memories
they visioned for me too much to disturb them.
“Cooliibah”: “Tamornie’s” barking lizard
is not the only reptile that has a voice (B. 18/6/’25).
The small smooth-skinned lizards common in N. 8.
Wales and called “slaves” by the children can
utter a note similar to that given by some frogs.
I noticed one recently gliding along a rail on the
ground. Suddenly it saw me, stopped, uttered its
warning to its mate, whose head just appeared at the
other end, and then both glided back under cover.
I have heard the note a few times since then, and
on making a search have located more of the beauti-
ful little creatures under wood of some kind. A
pair of them live close to our seed-beds and may be
seen basking when the sun is warm.
“J.A.”: Is there any bird in Australia
that can make a more terror-charged cry or scream
than the powerful owl, met with in the dense
forests of Gippsland
and other parts of
Victoria? One remark-
able thing concerning
it is that so small a
bird comparatively
speaking, should be
able to produce so
great a volume of
sound. It is not only
loud, but is weird and
penetrating. Every
one who has heard the
cry gives a different
description of it, but
all agree that it creates
terror. This owl also
differs from others in-
asmuch as it will attack
and kill small animals
as well as birds. A
naturalist who took up
an observation post in
order to watch tl;e
habits of kangaroos on
one of their play-
grounds was given an
unexpected sight. Two
kangaroo does with
young joeys were amus-
ing themselves when,
without warning, a
piercing shriek, gradu-
ally developing into an
uncanny roar, came
from a tree overhead.
Both kangaroos were so
terrified that they fled,
leaving their young
behind. This seemed
to be the effect desired,
for an owl flew down
and attacked the
smaller of the joeys,
and in a few moments
had its throat ripped
open. Then it gave
another cry, even worse
than the first, where-
upon its mate arrived and joined in the evening-
meal.
‘‘Orange : The old objection to catfish as
food (B. 18/6/’25) is almost- dead in N. S. Wales.
Twenty years ago many people would not dream
of tasting one. 1 remember about that time watch-
ing a woman fishing in the Macquarie just below
Warren. Almost every fish she caught was thrown
back because it wore “those horrid whiskers.” 1
tried in vain to persuade her to test one of them.
Three years later 1 fished with her in the Marthaguy
River, near Inglegar, in the same district, and
noticed that she bagged every kind of fish caught,
catfish included. Codfish were fairly plentiful and
of a good size, but only the smaller ones could
compare with the catfish for delicacy of flavor. The
grotesque appearance caused by the whiskers gives
protection to the fish where larger varieties abound.
“Jimmy Possum”: Iu a Bauattalaud farm-
ing district a while back a vis from Maorijand
spoke in glowing terms of tVe .lioney-pr.odrfoing
properties of a flowering plant Vknc|Rvn to him as
Paddy’s lucerne. So impressed werteHis honey-raising
friends that they asked him to procure them some
seed, which he did, a sackful botoigj 0 btaimil. This
HAD BEEN G[?]TTLNG IT ALL THE MONTH.
CUSTOMER: “How much do yer charge for dog’s meat?”
BUTCHER: “Nothing, sir, nothing!”
CUSTOMER: “Right, y’arc, then—that’s what I owe yer!”
was sown, and in a few months the experimenters
were cursing over the finest crop of they
had ever grown. No doubt the yelyow blooms of
this vigorous plant contain a fair amounthof nectar;
but most farmers would rather go han<jyless than
have their cultivation paddocks over-run by a growth
which will smother out even the haifiy vcoucli-grfoss
once it gets a footing. Cattle will eat: it reatdiy
when young, but it quickly becomes too ;tough fond
woody to be useful as fodder. If, however, “Centre”
is really anxious to free his 10-acre patejh of Sida
retusa (B. 28/5/’25), let him introduce about 50
goats or sheep to it; they’ll perform, the job
willingly. I know of at least one ease* im which a
South Queensland cocky cleared an apparently hope-
lessly overgrown paddock by taking this coußse. The
jumbucks in a season or two exterminatecP every plfont,
and a vigorous growth of couch-grass tooik its plfoce.
Of course, if there are any fruit-trees in the ,10-
acre block, the goats would trim up his, trees for
him, too. In that case the only practicable method
of eradicating the pest is by intense cultivation for
several seasons. And a word of warning;, if you
don’t want to spread the nuisance, keep houses away
from it.
“D. 8.”: Many kinds of water-fowl come
a thud at night-time by mistaking a galvanised-iron
roof for a shimmering pool of water (B. 11/6/125). I
know’ a farmer in Riverina who had in his possession
for many years a large black swan that noso-dived
on to the roof of the homestead one frosty night.
Apart from a broken pinion the bird ufos not
seriously injured, and soon became a pet ef the
familjq
“W.Y.N.” : Re “Billy See’s” advice to end-
up fence posts the way they grew. An old Tasmanian
friend of mine, who experimented for years, was a
firm believer in putting the head end of the post in
the ground, and used the same argument as William
in support of the theory. He maintained that the
capillary action of the sap-channels would draw
moisture from the ground, thus keeping the post
always damp, and tending to make it rot. On the
other hand, if the post were put in on its head, the
natural action of the sap channels would check tlie
moisture proceeding froni the ground, and also
quickly get rid of any that entered at the top of the
post. To settle the question he obtained two gate-
posts (gum) from the same tree, squared, painted
and tarred them, and then put them in reverse ways.
Unfortunately he died before either post showed
any sign of rotting, and now no one knows for
sure which is which. It would be interesting to
know whether the sap channels in dead timber do
act in one way only. It is known that the growing
tree pumps the sap with a sort of heart beat, and
this suggests some kind of valves in the channels.
“Slam”: The red-cross spider is not the
only dyed-in-the-wool sectarian among the native fauna.
There is the “Catholic frog” or “Holy Cross toad”
of the dry interior, which disappears during a
drought, but reappears. in thousands when the
weather breaks, to the delight of spoonbills, storks
and cranes. The body colors are bright-yellow, green
ai.o orange-red, with a prominent black cross on the
back, formed of many small lumps of warts. Then
there is the Crusader bug, a large brown squash-bug
which has begun to take to orchards. It has a
neat yellowish cross covering the whole of the back.
There seems, however, to be no record of the square
and compass on bug, beetle or frog.
“M.H.H.”: Old Bill had driven a bullock
team along N.S.W. South Coast roads for years, and
the lonely trails had made him a man of moods.
He was also addicted to periodical intakes of beer
on a generous scale, and it was after one of these
that he read the announcement of his own engagement
in the local rag. He was astonished ; but as the
lady in the case —she had inserted the item her-
self—had a distinct memory of the proposal, old Bill
accepted his fate with manful resignaticn. On
one point only was he firm —he refused to approach
a church, so the ceremony came off at the bride's
home. The lady and her relatives were so apprehen
sive of the bridegroom stampeding back to the bush
before the knot was tied that nobody was allowed
to make any remark when he strolled into the
dining-room with his hat on, and kept it there
throughout the proceedings. Something of romance,
however, must have touched his casual soul, for he
entered into his wife’s idea of a real honeymoon
with interest, and the happy couple left per bullock
team for the fastnesses of the bush. Bill must have
had some of tiic rudiments of etiquette instilled into
him during that rapturous period, for it was noticed
on his return that he was very careful to remove
his headgear indoors.
“C.M.” : David Collins, tlie first Advocate-
General (N.S.W.), described the occurrence at the
Hawkesbury in December, 1795, of an “extraordinary
meteorological phenomenon.” Four farms were totally
cut up by a fall of large flakes of ice. The standing
wheat was beaten down, the ears cut off and the
grain threshed out. Of the Indian corn the thick
stalks were broken and the cobs deposited at the
roots. The sides of the trees facing the storm
looked as though large shot had been discharged at
them, and branches and twigs were scattered every-
where. Even after two days of this destruction, tin l
ice remained on the ground as large as when it fell.
Some flakes measured six to eight inches long by
two inches thick. Has anything like it ever hap-
pened since ?
AFTER THE TAMING OF THE SHREW.
HENPECK: “Wotchew thinker marriage?”
NEW-WED: "‘Bliss ain’t no name for it!”
“Ned Kelly”: In Western Queensland
some years ago I came across a black gin who had
been hamstrung by her lord and master owing to
her propensity for “walkabout.” She was an unlovely-
looking object, but, although she had to travel on
all fours like a dog, managed to do her full share
of the camp work. I have known her to travel
thus 30 miles in a long day. She was the mother
of four children.

THE PIPER OF PIPECLAY POINT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Old Peter tne ’possumer iiyed all alone
In a queer little hut he’d erected of stone ;
He was crippled and bent—-he’d been to the war —
His face was besmirched with a hideous scar.
Some said he was “ratty,” some called lnm a fool.
For he would walk home with the children from
school,
Though most of them feared him and some ran away,
And few cared to listen to what he'd to say.
Beneath his ill-shape he’d a heart that could sing,
And child-love to him was a wonderful thing;
So he plaited a rope and then hung them a swing.
From the great spreading branch of a tall leaning
tree,
By the side of the hut, where the children could see,
He knotted it thrice and he fastened it strong.
The tree towered high and the rope dangled long.
Then slowly and shyly the school-children came,
And some of them whistled or called him by name.
A freckled boy crept in, then sat on the seat,
And red dust flew up as he slithered his feet;
Then outward he flew, with a rollicking fling,
Like the swoop of a hawk on a quivering wing.
And Peter was joyfully watching him swing.
Soon confidence came to those waiting outside,
And they all rushed in, for the gate opened wide.
They laughed and they sang, as they circled in glee,
And formed a big ring round the old leaning tree.
Then there was a patter of scampering feet
That flew around corners and followed the street;
And children came in from the ranges and flats,
Some carried their doils and some carried their cats ;
Though old Peter’s face was a hideous thing
He was joyous at heart and was proud as a king,
For he’d captured their love when he built them a
swing.
TUE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A SCHOLARD.
"What he the date in three weeks’ time, maate?"
"Lemme sec; to day es twenty-first. Three sevens es twenty-one.
Add on —'e do he forty-twoth, hoay.”
They came in the morning ere Peter was up
And stayed till he’d swallowed his scant evening sup,
And any child missing from home at the Point
Was found at his humpy (they’d named it “The
Joint”).
For over a year they came every day ;
Then Death, the Grim Reaper, took Peter away.
Peaceful his rest is, with no stone at his head,
But carpets of roses the children have spread,
And bunches of wattle bloom there in the Spring,
And each kind of blossom the seasons may bring.
His spirit, they say, is still guarding the swing.

“G.H.W.” : I nominate the climbing perch
(Anabus scandens ) as the best pedestrian in the fish
family. It is alleged that Ganges River fishermen
have kept members of the species alive out of water
for a period of six or seven days. I have doubts
about their tree-climbing power, but some reputable
people have averred that they do possess it, and
an old record states that Sir Joseph Banks “took a
climbing perch from a moist cavity in the stem ot
a Palmyra palm which grew near a lane.”

“Wai-hoi”: It can rain when it likes in
the N.T. In May, 1923, between Wave Hill on the
west and towards the Gulf on the east, there was a
stretch of over 100 miles of floodwaters as a result
of what folks out that way reckon was a cloud-
burst# All hands at Wave Hill station spent a
rorty night on the roof of the store with as much
as 10 feet of water lapping around. At any
moment it was odds on mixed bathing. In some of
the affected districts cattle, horses and wild buffaloes
were washed away. A good idea of the height
floodwaters can reach may be got at the Limmen
River, 70 miles from Borroloola, where the skeleton
of a buff, is wedged in the fork of a big river gum,
18 feet above the ground. Jack Richards, the Mata-
ranka-Borroloola mailman, lost 18 horses during that
little wash-out, and not a skerrick of them has ever
been traced. They were carried probably down the
river and out into the Gulf, there to keep the
Douglas Mawson company.
“Pick” : Can any member of tlie Council
produce a record to beat that of the Harvey family
of Jindabyne (N.S.W.) ? End to end, the six brothers
bridged a distance of 37 feet 9 inches. Dick filled
the longest span with 7ft. sin., and Joe the
shortest with 6ft. lin. Ned, the wag of the towering
bunch, was once a witness in the Cooma Police
Court, and was questioned on his height. He
admitted that he was either 6ft. llin. or lift. 6in.
—-he wasn’t sure which.

“Curlew”: No man, without exhaustive
biological research, can authoritatively state that any
dingo, no matter what his color, has no trace of a
cross in his composition. One of the earliest svmp-
toms of atavism in scrub or other neglected cattle
is the prevalence of brindles and blacks among them,
showing a reversion to an earlier strain. So with the
dingo, the black ones may be originated by immediate
pr ogenitors or may derive their color from an ancestor
of many past generations. Forty years ago dingoes
other than red were rare in Queensland. Personally',
1 don’t believe that any dingo other than red,
except possibly a freak albino, is absolutely' pure.
Further, I don’t believe that even any red dingo,
ENDANGERING HIS DYNASTY.
KING BILLY (looking at latest picture of Prince of Wales ): “Mine
kin tinkit him kin plenty long time catchem gin!”
except maybe in the Northern Territory, is absolutely
pure bred. In the Nive scrub, north of the Warrego,
I have seen numerous handsome dingOes, black with
white on breast and white-tipped tails, but no one
supposed them to be pure—they did not materialise
until after the kelpie and Tully sheep-dogs came into
the district. The beautiful way in which they will
amuse themselves working sheep when not actively
engaged in killing shows a good sheep-dog strain in
their ancestors. I have seen some comical-looking
packs, up to 20, and ranging from mongrel-looking
deer-hounds and kangaroo-dogs to still more mongrel-
looking fox-terriers.
“A.E.T.”: Re the Pikedale settlement
soldier .who, single-handed, sank a well to 25 feet,
water level (B. 11/6/’25). “Red Jerry” Sweeney,
nearly 70 years of age, sank on the Lightning Ridge
opal-field (N.S.W.) a shaft (sft. x 2£ft.) through
gravel, white limestone and desert sandstone, to the
opal dirt at 73ft. To do this he climbed up and
down by footholds cut in the side of the shaft, and
kept hold of the handrope fastened from the bedlog
at the surface to the bottom; he fished for his filled
bucket per grapnel hook. Harry Walsh, Joe Gunnel,
Jacky Neighbour, ‘‘P. and O. Jack,” “Charcoal
Jimmy,” George Cutler, “Old Jack” Bird and others
sank similar shafts on this field, ranging from a
shallow depth to 60 feet.
“Gouger”: The single-handed 26ft. well (B.
11/6/’25) has been beaten in Australian mining
history thousands of times. I knew a man sink
to 60ft., “shooting” country all the way, and then
put in a 6uit. cross-drive each way from the bottom
of the shaft, climbing up and down and hauling
every bucket of mullock unassisted.
* * * *
“Hamer”: One of the mysteries to be in-
spected by the expedition of Lance le Souef through
N.-W. Australia is that mysterious body of water
known as the Mill Stream, because of its strong
current. It starts apparently from nowhere, and
ends in a pool; but at its best going it is esti-
mated to run 77 million gallons in the 24 hours.
Water in an alleged “dry country” which is in such
a hurry to get nowhere is, naturally, a subject of
curiosity.
* * * *
“Slam” : Although smaller than the average
wallaby, the tree kangaroos of the thick coastal
scrubs north of Townsville are the prettiest mar-
supials I have seen in any part of Australia. There
is not nearly such a disproportion between the fore
and hind limbs of this animal as in the ordinary
kangaroo, and the great ripping hind toe is not
developed. The face and ears are black, the sides
and belly almost white, the limbs yellow and the
paws black. The males are yellowish on the back
and the females grey. These quaint leaf-eaters sleep
in the highest trees all day, curled up like native-
bears, and feed only at night. They are astonishingly
active in the branches, are also very fast on the
ground, and can jump down safely- from a great
li eight.
* * * *
“M.G.”: The most wonderful portrait by
nature that I have ever seen may be viewed on the
old road running through Long Flat, near Murray
Bridge (S.A.). A big gum-tree depicts with wonderful
fidelity the head of a Maori chief. It is a marvellous
counterfeit. The tattoo pattern of spiral scrolls,
circles and curved lines on the face is complete.
Even the coarse, curly hair, prominent cheek-bones,
large eyes and well-formed nose are all faithfully
outlined.
* * * *
“Up Top”: A few of the bucks on the
finger point of Cape York Peninsula use a spring
line for catching fish.
As some of the “boys”
have been on beche-de-
mer luggers, I’ve a sus-
picion they pinched the
idea from New Guinea.
A long clastic sapling
is chosen as a fishing-
rod, and its butt end
rammed firmly into the
river bank, or between
rocks on a coastal pool.
To the tapering end of
this rod a fishing-line
is secured. A straight
sapling is then driven
in close by. About a
foot below the top of
the latter is tied a
string about 2ft. long.
To the end of this
string a peg 6in. long
is affixed. The rod with
the fishing-line is then
bent over the water so
that the baited hook
is a few inches off the
bottom, and the peg
line stretched across
and over the bent rod.
An adjustment is then
made which constitutes
the peg the spring of a
trigger. The trigger
itself is the hook, and
the fish the trigger-
finger, the line pulls
the peg, and, the
“bolt” being released,
up flies the rod, with
the fish dangling a good
2ft. above water,
so that no other fish
may scoff him during
the night. My mate
and I used the idea,
and often found it an easy way of obtaining break-
fast.
“Spenner” : The rabbit seems to be keeping
his education well abreast of the times. A trapper
has now to bring all his cunning and ingenuity into
play to be successful. A few years ago the first
setting in new country always proved the most pro-
ductive. Now traps have frequently to be kept in
the same places for several days before bunny will
approach. Once he would make straight for the
freshly disturbed earth as a fine playground, but
generations of pursual have developed hereditary
caution. For the same reason the poison trail may
not be visited for several nights; and it takes a
well-camouflaged bait to deceive brer now. It is
no uncommon sight after the first rains to see a line
of green shoots mark what had been the trail of
poisoned wheat. A cocky with his property enclosed
by 3ft. 6in. netting regarded it as rabbit-proof. A
modern vigorous buck considers such an obstacle a
mere stepladder.
“Quintex”: For two or three days in tht
clear water on the lee side of a coral head near
Double Island (Q.) I studied the antics of an Bft.
blue pointer that was mothering her just-arrived
school of youngsters, little fellows about 12in. Jong.
The mother was generally lying very still but
wide awake behind the coral growth, or rubbing
herself against its projections, but she was always
ready to streak out after large intruders that looked
HOW HE KNEW.
JUK ( ski-ting ) : “Sec over there? Well, on Toosday I wus walkin along, an’ I stepped
right on top of a big rattlesnake.”
JIM: “Garn! There ain’t any rattlers in Orstralia —how didyer know it teas one, any-
how?”
JOE: “I could hear its teeth chattering the minute it saw me.”
dangerous to the juniors, who were busy darting
after the young shrimps which appeared to be the
chief item of their diet. I dropped a tempting bait
and was lucky enough to hook one little chap that
came out of the water just ahead of the charge
the old shark made right up to the gunwale of the
flattie. I left promptly, and next day a better
armed visit of investigation showed that the school
had changed its address.
* * * *
“Pick”: Others besides birds attack and
kill weaklings of their kind. While tailing herds of
cattle on the plains of Monaco, or a-track with drov-
ing mobs, I have often noted the different receptions
accorded to healthy-looking, well-fed stragglers
rounded up on the way, and those that were mean-
looking and poor. The sleek and fat were always
greeted by their fellow travellers with welcoming
murmurs and playful bucks, whilst the poorly-
conditioned and dejected-looking animals were horned
to earth, and only much cursing and whip-lashing
could rescue them. There’s much of human nature
amongst the birds and beasts.
* * * *
“Centre”: Can any Abo. mycologist give
the name of what is apparently a variety of boletus,
of a deep violet color? I’ve known and eaten this
’fungus in a score of different shades, but never
before tinged with anything like purple. Is it a
new variety of the species, or is it a freak? I did
not risk eating the little stranger, though
I breakfasted off a dish of fried brown boleti the
morning I found it. By the way, why not grow
puff-balls for market? Thousands are eaten in Europe
and America, and a good many in Australia too, by
those who know what is good. I tried growing
them last year in flower-pots in the garden, but
without luck; this season, however, the same pots
have produced a fair crop, the largest single growth
being just under I4in. round—quite a satisfactory
breakfast when sliced and fried in butter and
served with pepper and salt.
* * * *
“Jesmond” : What does the toadfish
( batrachidae ) depend upon to repel enemies? They
are in millions round our Victorian shores, and,
being rarely more than 6in. long, one would expect
them to be preyed upon by other fish; but none
seems to touch them. They are very similar to
>und toads about the head, and their skin exudes
a slime which perhaps has some poisonous constituent.
I had a dog which caught dozens during a walk on
the beach; he never attempted to bite them, but
dropped them as soon as he got them ashore. I
used to be sceptical as to their toxic powers, regard-
ing that story as one of the many toad myths in
a fresh form. Some time ago an exceptionally
high tide brought thousands up an inlet on Phillip
Island (Vic.), hundreds being killed by the fresh
water and left stranded when the tide ebbed. Whilst
walking the next day I counted seven cats, dead,
and beside each the remains of a toadfish supper.
* * * *
“Te Babarantiko” : The impulse to knock
off work on the tick of the clock is not peculiar to
man. At the Hurstville (N.S.W.) brickworks a
horse employed in hauling clay' from the pit stops
work instantly the whistle goes. If the truck is
halfway to the top when the welcome message sounds,
the moke refuses to take it any farther. He backs
it to the bottom.
“Bunya”: I am satisfied the “twelve
apostles” are true feathered communists, in spite or
the textbooks. The family is seldom twelve
but commonly eight or ten, and the noisy Bohemians
always keep strictly to themselves. The nest, of
reddish mud, is lighter and more symmetrically finished
than that of the peewee, and is usually built in the
scrub away from water. I have seen all hands at
work on one nest, and as there were eight eggs in
it after four days, there can be no doubt it was
a community nest, and that no other was built.
Later on the whole tribe began a second nest, and
at least three broods were reared in this way between
September and February. In spite of inaccuracy,
the name “twelve apostles” is better than the ornitho-
logist’s formal “grey jumper,” though in different
localities this popular bird is known by many
different names, and is commonly confused with the
stick-building babblers, also called “twelve apostles.”
* * * *
“Cobber-o’-mine”: Tell “Ted” that his
candle-lighting girl doesn’t hold the record. In a
similar competition, Alf Wagner, of Boonah (Q.),
succeeded in lighting 63 candles with the one match.
I wonder if he holds the championship ?
* -X- ' * *
was in occupation of my
favorite haunt on the cliffs, grass-carpeted and
sheltered by friendly barriers of rock, when the
silence was disturbed by what seemed to me the
sound of bells across the water. I sat up and
ran back over all the sea superstitions I had read
of. The tinkle continued, low and sweet, until at
last I rounded the face of the cliffs to investigate.
And in the next crevice I stumbled across the
TOO SUDDEN.
“Vot caused Coheri to haf der vit?”
"He vos asked for a donation to a viremeu’s
charity.”
Perfect Fisherman. He was leaning back with a
pipe in his mouth and a book in his hands, and
at his feet rested two short rods, fixed into the
ground. At the sensitive ends of the rods where
the lines were attached a couple of little bells
quivered; a sharper jangle, it was clear, served to
warn the lazy one of a bite. It didn’t seem strictly
according to Izaak Walton, but it looked comfortable.

A wind that blew off snow-capped moun-
tains, with only intervals of sunshine,
huddled fragile femininityjinto furs on the first
day of the Grand National meeting at Flem-
ington. Every fair patron aired a more or
less priceless bit of miaow, but a trio of
capes of squirrel and one of fringed kolinsky
were particularly enviable. The latest color
in suiting i,s cocoa undiluted, and popular
fancy revelled in headpieces that bloomed
in every tone of a bed of petunias. So full
of accidents was the racing that humane folk
who feel for beasts and their fellow man
wondered if the sport of Spain could be more
brutal. The Kensington Steeplechase, with
only four horses left to finish, seemed to
record a tumble at every obstacle; but Grand
National hurdlers flew the sticks like larks
until the final turn brought the ambulance
along. Governor Stradbroke was an inter-
ested spectator, and the members’ stand held
Society in its best. Mrs. Robert Knox wore
nigger and fawn plaid covering, topped by a
brown hat; the Mackay lady mixed black
with a grey hat, and ’possum prinked up Mrs.
G. Hisken’s beige. Mrs. Gilbert Lodge, the
Cliauvel dame, the Alister Clark and Jim
Fairbairn couples and Mrs. Carty Salmon
were of the lawn strollers.
“Kid Boots” pinched the toes of first-
nighters at His Majesty’s on Saturday.
Josie Melville tripped about in frocking upon
which every flapper cast longing eyes. A
pink taffeta creation it was, front-panelled
with frills of jewelled lace and touches of
floral embroidery and blue ribbon; also a
white gown splashed with silver and feather-
edged came decidedly under the heading of
sweet. Adele Crane favored clinging cover-
ing finalised in frills, and the statuesque
Jean Newcornbe was a sensation in red and
white with the two-colored fringe. Gorgeous
ballets included a Spanish setting of maize-
hued gowns, with huge jewelled combs sup-
porting a Niagara of lace veils, and the final
curtain descended on an arrangement sug-
gesting strawberries and cream. Flowers
a-plenty were passed over the footlights. The
George Tallises, some Tait maidens, and
many members of the “Primrose” company
watched proceedings from the boxes.
In “A Bill of Divorcement,” at the Play-
house, Isabel Handley appears as an attrac-
tive modern flapper in apple-green with flared
front flounce. Mrs. Madge Morrison, who
impersonates the heroine, Margaret Fairfield,
is a sister of Miss .Toske and Miss Goyder,
whose combined efforts, under the pen-name
of “Neville Goyder,” are responsible for at
least ttvo readable novels. The lady dons
cherry-red with an extra skin of tan-liued
coat and furs.
The Governor’s lady went along the other
afternoon to turn the key in the hall door
of the new hostel in West: Melbourne of the
Travellers’ Aid Society. Eight years of use-
fulness the handful of workers have to their
credit in assisting lone and new arrivals
from the country, other States or overseas.
An aider is stationed at the wharf to guide
the stranded woman, girl or child to a
temporary lodging. The T.A.S. is frequently
being called upon to discover wandering
young folk who have deserted home in quest
of adventure. The spick-and-span hostel
accommodates about 27 in cheery style. Lady
Stradbroke lias shown a practical interest in
the growth of the society, and a gold key in
the shape of the official badge was handed
her by the president, Mrs. John MacLeod.
The general secretary, Miss Nest Malcolm,
got well-deserved praise for her work in
pushing on the T.A.S.
“The Planets,” by Gustav Holst, arranged
for two pianos by Nora Day and Vally
Lasker, had a second hearing one day last
week at the Assembly Hall, thanks to Mrs.
Jimmy Dyer. It is a brilliant description
of the heavenly bodies which pianists William
James and Harold Elvins fingered with much
success.
“Nanette” and the other lady friends and
male acquaintances of Jimmy Smith were
introduced by their management to local
presswomen at a tea-drinking in the foyer
of the Princess’s. Hugh Ward, looking
younger than ever, whitened locks notwith-
standing. made all acquainted, and had a
few words to say about the kindly feeling
existing between the stage and women wield-
ers of the pen. May Beatty, smiling above
a black ensemble suit, seconded, and draw-
ing her squirrel cloak around her diminutive
figure “Nanette” Elsie Prince made the con-
fession that she had found everybody and
everything in Australia awfully nice.
Club night on Thursday at the Embassy
was a special occasion when principals of
"No, No, Nanette,” were guests of Jennie
and Eileen Brenan after the theatre. Ben-
jamin Fuller and his brother John, Hugh
Ward and the ever-youtliful Percy Hunter,
were of the party. “Nanette” tripped about
in rose-hued frocking and fringe; black velvet
covered Olive Grant’s six feet and an inch ;
ivory eharinante and shiny lace kept Wini-
fred Dalle warm; and Anita Shaw was in
flame-hue. Amongst other theatrical charm-
ers was Maud Fane, a slim figure in black
dangling much gold and black bead fringe.
Airman Pinedo, who revolved with Vera de
Bavay, was almost missed in such a constel-
lation, and lots of bonnie girls and nice young
men were merely members. Gertrude Dix
was there, wearing something unique in
plumbago blue, and a pet of a frock of gold
lace, tissue and fur adorned Sheila Barrett.
At a Kroisler concert last week the atten-
-1 ion of the crowded house was divided be-
tween the exits and entrances of the violin-
ist and the top storeys of three feminine
patrons. One had a youthful oval face
crowned with a pompadour erection; rather
large, strongly marked and less youthful
features were allied to a fuzzed bob of the
Gaby doll order in the second ; and a neatly
pinned and coiled coiffure belonged to the
third, a mature matron. All were alike,
however, in having hair whiter than the
driven tow. Judging from the delighted com-
ments overheard, an outbreak of bleached
locks is imminent.
St. Kilda Town Hall glowed gold and
purple with conscious pride on the occasion
of the Mayoral Ball. Imposing was the
entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Levi with their
official guests, who included the Melbourne
Mayoral pair (a Levi supported a Brunton
and a Brunton a Levi) and at least a dozen
other Mayors, their wives and droves of alder-
men. All having been neatly arranged on the
stage, the 20 debutantes and their escorts made
obeisance before the civic heads. Such dig-
nity! The wliite-frocked maidens, carrying
posies dangling gold and yellow streamers,
executed a sort of flying movement with
their arms and wiped knee-length frocks upon
the floor. Four stately heads bowed in
unison to the aeroplane curtsies, and with
courtly grace two white-gloved mayoral
hands spread heartwards over fur-edged robes
and gold chains. Lest the crowd should lay
rude hands upon the tableau a barricade of
yellow ribbons was linked at intervals to
staffs supporting primrose-hued lights. The
debs., who all wore a touch of gold in their
frocking, danced the lancers to syncopated
music with heaps of decorum. After that
gears were reversed, bonds were loosed and
the ice melted.
Mrs. Maida-Pile was describing her latest
purchase in antiques. “Such a glorious bit
of old Jacobean I bought yesterday. I’m
dying to have it home —a black oak dinner-
waggon, with” “Oh, how lovely, dear!”
broke in her humble sister. “It will save
a lot of work when we’re alone. We can
have our meals a la carte. I’ve often won-
dered what it meant.”
One of the most attractive exhibits at the
Women Artists’ Exhibition is the exquisitely-
painted china

cognised a s

which is filling the Athenaeum. The lady
herself, a cpieen of the region, is like a starlit
night in a deep blue gown against a silver
train.
A well-known musical critic has earned
the indignation of local professional fiddlers.
He stated with reference to Kreisler’s play-
ing of the Bach E Major Suite that “For
the first time in years I heard a minuet
played in its right tempo.” Violinist Zel-
msn humorously alluded to this remark when
sharing in the welcoming of the Austrian at
the Melba Hall, referring to Ivreisler’s visit
as being worth while when such a knotty
problem was settled for all time. This Chat-
terer has met the fiend who takes the score
to concerts, but never yet spotted a metro-
nome carrier. So it is doubtful whether the
tempo of that minuet was recorded.
To earn the expenses for the forthcoming
ball of the Alliance Francai.se. whose pro-
ceeds go to the Alfred Hospital, Mr. C. W. Wil-
son, of Scott’s Hotel, allowed Alliance workers
to commandeer the dining-hall, lounge and
vestibule of the hotel for bridge, dancing,
music and the usual sales. Four hundred
patrons skidded over the wonderful floor of
the new lounge. May Rimmington, in a glist-
ening black gown, and Pierre Ilerry sccre-
taried the show, which numbered among its
commanding officers Mrs. James Angus, in
nutmeg hue, bronze-beaded; Monsieur and
Madame Vanderkclen; and the G. -V. Watson
pair. Olive Davies and the Edgar Dye, V. E.
Solomon and R. Williams dames were of the
trade promoters, and Walter Kirby sang to
his own accompaniment. A flutter was
caused by the arrival of Italian airman
Pinedo. with the Consul-General for Italy
and Signora Grossardi, Mrs. N. Anderson
and Vera de Bavay.

Mrs. Edwin Miller, in black and tan,
beckoned many of Melbourne’s Society
adorners to the Alexandra Club to farewell
Mrs. D. S. Fripp with music, tea and cake.
The guest of honor, who has since left for
England, came this way to say “How d’ you
do?” to her son and also to her brother,
Percy Alderton. The glad hand was ex-
tended at the gathering to Mrs. Jack Hay,
of Appleland, a niece of the hostess and
daughter of the Bowes Kelly pair. Mrs.
Hay’s ermine stole added richness to a black
coat and hat, and the farewelled leaned to-
wards magpie effects in ivory ottoman silk
upholstery and black satin headpiece.
When Doris Mary Dolbel, daughter of Mrs.
A. Dolbel, of Napier (M.L.), said “I will”
to George Stock, of London, at Christ
Church, St. Ivilda, she gleamed in silver
lame and lace, framed in a veil and train
of tulle. A cape of white fur was a wise
addition against Melbourne’s chilly fogs.
Linda Van Breda and Myrtle Williams,
over from the Windy Isles, and Lilian Cell
’maided in lace and tissue with a dash of
color and coiffures swathed to tone. The
wedding dinner was at Wiekliffe House, the
bride's mother wearing black brocaded velvet.
The new home-camp is to be pitched in Mel-
bourne.
Election of office-bearers and committee of
the Returned Army Nurses’ Club, Anzac
House, is now in full swing. This occasion
sees the retirement of the last of those who
formed the original committee, wdiose splendid
service has been directed by president Mrs.
Hume Turnbull. The R.A.N.C. has now a
membership of 371. with room for more. Re-
turned Army nurses, nursing V.A.’s and mas-
seurs are all welcomed. The club is suffering
a loss through the resignation of Miss Elvie
M. Overend. who lias been the secretary for
two and a half years. A trainee of Alfred
Hospital, she was turned down here when
the Big Scrap began, but in November, 1014.
paid her own passage to England, joined the
British Red Cross, and so on to Lady Dud-
ley’s Hospital in France. Family bereave-
ment brought her back to Victoria the next
year, but she returned later to see it through
with the A.I.F.
Jean Gilrutli, elder daughter of Dr. J. A.
Gilruth, onetime Administrator of the
Northern Territory, and of Mrs. Gilruth, of
South Yarra, promised the other afternoon
to share Theribi, the station home of Ken-
neth Austin, third son of the A. S. Austins
of Toorak. The chapel of C.E. Grammar,
done up in autumn foliage, heard the fully
choral service. The bride’s white gown was
agleam with crystal, silver and gold thread,
with much tulle veil. Bridesmaids three
were a contrast in georgette, shaded from
cream to bronze over gold tissue, and worn
vvith biscuit-hued veils and leaf wreaths. The
cake-cutting and congratulations were at St.
Neots, South Yarra, Mrs. Gilruth displaying
some mink fur upon cocoa-colored robing m
greeting the guests. Of the gathering were
various newly-acquired relatives or the
Austin clan, and also Admiral and Mrs. HaJI
Thompson, whose daughter married a brother
of the bridegroom the other day.
The G.P.O. sorters worked a bit harder
the other day sorting the first of the fleet
publications in a souvenir invitation booklet,
desiring the receiver’s presence at the Lord
Mayor's Ball on the 29th at the Exhibition
Building. Percy Deane, secretary to the
Prime Minister’s Department, is the most
popular man in this city just now, and one
of the busiest.
Hon. Mrs. Robert Lindsay and her two
lasses are sheltering at the Toorak home ot
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Knox. The latter is a
sister of Mrs. Lindsay and Mrs. George Lan-
ds,le, and all are 'daughters of the late Lady
Janet Clarke and step-sisters of baronet bn-
Rupert.
At the third lecture upon the music of
France, entitled "The Modern Renaissance,
at the Assembly Hall, Miss Josephine Pat-
terson read more of the inspired words oi
the French critic Calvocoressi, to which vio-
linist Gertrude Uealy, pianists Louise Gar-
gurevich and .Loris lladden and contralto
Violet Somerset supplied the vocal illustra-
tions. Members ot the Alliance Franchise
rallied in force and blessed Mrs. Jimmy Dyer,
their president, for the entertainment.
Oil' by the Aorangi last week to \ ancouver,
and thence to Alaska and California, went
Mrs. C- J. Ahern, wife of the well-known
solicitor, and their daughter, Kathleen. The
jaunt is likely to last until what Uncle
calls the fall.
Pauline Bindley was speeded on her way
to visit her uncle, Dr. Phil Bindley, in Lon-
don, with a musical tea-drinking at the Aus-
tral Salon. Hostess Mrs. Hawthorne iait
wore wrapping of black Ottoman silk, fui-
edged. The afternoon’s songbirds were \ lolet
and Malcolm Semple and George Gunman.
Coral Trenerry threw in some violin pieces,
and Dollie Turnbull accompanied.
Miss Adelaide's additions
The committee of tlic Lady Victoria Buxton Girls
Club, headed by Mrs. Charles and Lorna Todd, is
patting itself over the success ot its Winter Fair,
excellently organised and staged in the Town Halt
with Mrs. Glover to utter the benediction. Private
collectors lent anything from old documents to
warming-pans for the curio exhibition, and there was
a home-made flavor about the afternoon tea. Bridge
and a variety entertainment carried the money-
making into the evening.
However slow this village may have been to appre-
ciate Chulialdin’s artistry, it made amends at a
packed and excited farewell concert at the Town lla-1.
Success was largely due to the Con. staff and Mis.
H. FI. Dutton, who backed up the management with
personal enthusiasm and saw to it that the Russian
fiddler’s ability became known. illness kept the
Administrator away, but Mrs. Poole was there with
Mrs. Glover and the Duttons ; Clive Carey sang with
his usual easy charm, and George Pearce accompanied
worthily. At the moment, Chuhaldin is the Duttons
guest at their station near Kapunda, where lie is
practising English as well as bowing before departing
eastwards.
The engagement is announced of Phyllis, daughter
of the A. Pointons of Medindie, to Mr. S. J. R. Kemp ,
and of Gwenyth Craigie to Frederick, son of tiie
Winsloe Halls, and now in India.
Administrator Poole has just been having a double
celebration —his 52nd birthday and the 22nd anni-
versary of his marriage. His wife, a daughter of
the Francis Williams known as “Coekie” when head-
master of St. Peter’s College, has shown herself an
adept at blessedly brief and quite effective speeches
since her husband stepped temporarily into the
gubernatorial shoes. He, by the way, was chief
speaker at the Victoria League’s annual meeting,
'anu gave a pat on the back to the departments that
hold out a friendly hand to new-comers from over-
seas. The League is lucky in having as its secretary
Kathleen Kyffin Thomas, who did such fine work
as Red Cross sec. during the war.
It has been belatedly discovered that Gawler-plae.:
is about half as wide as it ought to be and ten times
as crooked. The fact lias been patent to the
ordinary citizen for years past, but it has taken
a building boom—some of the building already
accomplished and well up to the existing boundaries
to wake the authorities up to it.
Dorothea Spinney chose the Alcestis of Euripides
for her opening night, playing to an audience that
nearly filled, but failed to warm, the icy Liberal
Hall. The Mayoress poured tea for the elocutionist
in her rooms at the Town Hall on Monday, when
Professor Darnley Naylor vouched for her as a miracle
in revivifying the dry bones of the classics, and
Dorothy put in a word for the spiritualising of
science in her reply. She was the speaker at tne
Dalcroze Society's first annual meeting, and full
of approval of the excellent demonstrations by
Heather Cell and her pupils.
Mrs. A. M. Cudmore and Mrs. Bronte Smeaton
were joint hostesses at the Piccadilly, when pro-
gressive euchre —shades of the ’nineties I—Riled1 —Riled in
time till supper, after which there was dancing. The
euchre re-incarnation, by the way, proved a vast
success, and bridge may have to look to its laurels
at such frivols in the future.


The New Cobber
When I first came here they
passed remarks about my appear-
ance, sir.
That was until they found out
the precious cargo I had on the
boat, sir, and then —well you
have only to ask the first smoker
you meet the best cigarette on
the market, and every time the
answer is “Kensitas.”
And they all add cc as good as
really good cigarettes can be.”
Just common sense, I call it.

America's Independence was celebrated
last Friday at the Wentworth; but the first
thing that met the gaze of Uncle Sam’s sub-
jects was a reminder of prohibition. Up at
the top of the ballroom, where the spotlight
worked overtime, the management had
moored a rakish-looking craft whose name,
gaily blazoned in gold across the prow, read
“Rum Runner.” Only fowl of the air, how-
ever, came from that hatch. Through its
portholes a half-dozen hefty carvers served
the turkey called for by the hungry dancers.
The ballroom was packed to the doors with
beautifully-dressed American women and
not so beautifully-tailored American men.
The Stars and Stripes flew everywhere; and
gollywogs, all legs and no bodies, and a mis-
cellany of fantastic paper favors were the
chief table decorations. The U.S.A. Con-
suiar Lawtons’ table, at which Mrs. Coontz,
wife of the Admiral, was enthroned, was the
evening’s magnet. Here the silver-haired
and lilac-clad Queen of the States’ Navee
held court between the dances. But while
the music lasted she was footing it as fleetly
as her daughter Bertha or her niece, Doris
Green. Bertha, who is dark and jolly-look-
ing, mixed black tulle and blue ribands in
a satisfying whole, while her taller cousin
glittered in gold array. The nice-looking
Maclean girl, whose father manages the
quarter-deck of the Colorado, came with her
mother, who suggested a Bacchante (in
spite of the Rum-row doctrine) by wearing
a grape-festooned favor in her hair. The
nice Lachlan couple were among the night’s
entertainers. Frank Coffee divided his time
between the Admiral’s lady and the outsize
party he and Mrs. Coffee were signing up
for. Eating tlieir pumpkin-pie at this table
sat daughters Mrs. Dan Kelly and Mrs.
James Hughes, squired by their tall hus-
bands, youngest daughter Dorothy, the Clif-
ford Hay couple and that pillar of the
American circle Mrs. Evan Jones. The
Rexona Shelters brought a round table of
lads and lasses. Towards midnight 'the
assembled hundreds burst into song, and
helped to raise the syncopated strains _of
“Marching Through Georgia” to something
very like a paean.
Pauline Frederick, getting out of her
“Spring-Cleaning” overalls, headed the glitter-
some throng that swept on the Ambassadors
in time to usher in America’s Glorious
Fourth. Pauline was filmed in a web of
lace that must have cost a whole movie
picture to buy. This was made with the
wrist-long mediaeval sleeve that can only be
worn by the beauteous of arm and hand.
With her came June Elvidge, who, perhaps
running short of embossed velvet after the
shops were shut, finished off her dress for
the party with a back panel of ivory satin.
Mrs. “Snowy” Baker was an attendant satel-
lite, trailing a comet-like blaze of glory in
fuchsia georgette.
Youth was at the helm of the June Carni-
val in aid of the Sydney Hospital, and even
a moody night could not extinguish the radi-
ance thereof. The revels were enginereed
by a committee of pretty girls, aided and
abetted by hordes of others just as attractive
and fleet of foot; their job was peddling
every variety of jazz cap and balloon plus a
fascinating line of paper dolls. Alice Carru-
thers, the president, beamed contentment
above a cunning mixture of rose and silver
lace. Valerie Britten and May Matchett, the
secretaries, and Bronzie Clonan and Clarice
O’Connor, the treasurers, deserve an honor-
able mention. Experience kept its eye on
the function, and the Carrutherls dame),
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh and Dr. Fiaschi's
lady helped to navigate the jazz ship free
from all shoals. Matron Kellet, the hospi-
tal’s chatelaine, was another notable figure.
Surgeon-Knight Alexander MacCormick
took an afternoon off from the operating-
table last week to give daughter Alison away
in matrimony to John Martin, eldest son of
that W. P. Martin of the woolbuying firm,
once of Sydney and now settled in Devon-
shire. The trystirig-place was St. Stephen’s.
Masses of poppies steeped the Phillip-street
kirk in an aura of gold, and the bride’s
sparkling ivory and gold raiment was an
added glow in the hoary pile. The frock
wore its sleeves wrist length, was cut on
those classically severe lines which only a
very rich material can survive, and for its
train drew a misty wash of Hon i ton lace. A
tulle veil cascading over her blushes, and a
positive fortune in mauve and gold orchids
completed the bride’s magnificence. Sister
Morna, Alison's only bridesmaid, was a flut-
ter of white georgette and yellow ribands
and yellow roses. Her Carmen-like head-
dress was a gold lace fan, erect at the back
of the head and encircled by a wreath of yel-
low pansies. Brother Malcolm best-manned.
The reception was held at Kilmory, the family
roof-tree at Point Piper, the MacCormick
lady doing the honors complete from head to
toe in cigar-brown softness. Outstanding
teatures of the party wore the absence of
speeches and the profusion of flowers; draw-
ing-room, billiard-room and the awniuged
courtyard where the buffet was , spread sug-
gested a horticultural show. Among the
guests were some of Sydney’s oldest inhabi-
tants, one of these being the mother of the
present generation of S, M. Herald Fair-
faxes.
Queens and archbishops and vice-regals
were tangled up in the melee at the Town
Hall when the Scottish Royal Arch Masonic
Ball held the fort. To begin with, there was
the crowning of the queen of the ball to
dazzle the eye of the gallery beholder. This
momentous ceremony was performed by
Dyson Austen. Mrs. Ingham. Drummoyne's
nominee tor royalty, raked in the sceptre and
orb at what might be regarded as bargain
rates; £B9 14s. 9d. entitled her to be
ensconced in the throne with the assistance
ot six masters of ceremonies, 20 ladies of
the court, six maids of honor, and a retinue
of trainbearers and pages that totally
eclipsed the cavalcade Elizabeth led to Kenil-
worth. Before the last sigh of admiration
over these pomps had died to nothingness,
in swept the Masons themselves. A blaze
of decorations and orders, they marched nobly
under the arch of steel that clattered to for-
mation even at their approach. That pro-
cession had iust completed its wheels and
detours when Sir Dudley and daughter
Elaine arrived. Their entry, of course, neces-
sitated another procession. And after that,
under an arch, all rosebuds and green gar-
lands, that apparently came into existence by
magic, a string of dainty little debs stepped
forward to make their bob to vice-royalty.
Henri Verbrugghen, visiting the scenes of
former triumphs, had a week crammed with
receptions, luncheons, dinners and entertain-
ments. Separate functions were arranged
by the Conservatorium professors and staff,
the Con. students and members of the old
orchestra. Harry Lauder and the Soccer
match, with motor-trips to Bulli Pass and
elsewhere, were sandwiched in. Sons Phil-
lippe and Marcel were in evidence through-
out, but Dr. Adrian had to return early in
the week to his medical duties at Guyra.
Henri is now spending a quiet week at Mel-
bourne with pianist Edward Goll.
Verbrugghen heard Roland Foster's star
pupil, Ethel Osborn of the bird-like voice,
during bis stay in Sydney, and promised her
an engagement with liis Minneapolis orches-
tra if she journeys to Europe via U.S.A. He
considers Ethel a potential prima donna with
a vocal equipment already adequate.
The golden head of the lady alongside
gleamed for many months among the moun-
tains of music
at Albert’s in
King - street.
Its own e r,
Evelyn Grieg,
possessed
brains, too,
and as far
back. as 1909
the clever
pianist made
her first hit
by composing
a Dutch scene
for “Mother
Goose.” Some
time ago the
Sydneyite took
her talents to
America, and
since her arri-
val has had
the joy of see-
ing five of her
songs pub-
lished and making a hit on the U.S. market.
One of these, “Baby’s Hair,” is dedicated
to Dorothy Helmrich; the words are by
Maxwell Foster, a grand-niece of the com-
poser of “The Old F'olks at Home.” Evelyn
is of Norseland origin, and claims kinship
with Edward Grieg.
The Old Boys of Sydney Grammar lived
over lots of memories of school days the other
night when, between dances, they sat on
forms round the b’g schoolroom. This was
festooned with black and gold streamers and
decorated with fluttering groups of young
things. The girls were in dazzling and color-
ful frocking, and the boys sported paper caps
of every make and blend of color, worked up
by the clever fingers of Mrs. Burrows. The caps
were sold in the interests of the scholarship
endowment, to which the night’s gate-money
will be devoted. Old Sydneians like Harry
Storey brought their girls and boys to the
party, and other big public schools sent their
ambassadors. Sydney High was represented
by wildflowor-expert Arthur Eedy and his
Shakspeare-loving wife; Crown Prosecutor
Coyle and his pretty daughters came on be-
half of St. Ignatius’, and Scots' College was
upheld by Hugh Reid. Headmaster Dett-
man’s wife was very much missed from the
revels. Ipfluenza,
Bernice Vert has her face set towards
Broadway, according to the critics who have
seen her acting in "Lazybones,” one of the
latest productions of the Jefferson stock
company. She will be chiefly remembered
in Australia for her sleep-walking act in
“The Blue Mountain Mystery,” the film
which starred pretty Marjorie Osborne.
Since then the clever girl has been in
America, first making pictures and later
acting in stock. Incidentally, before taking
her engagement with the Jeffersons Bernice
was rehearsing in “The Winds of Chance,”
but threw down her part when the manage-
ment introduced a full-blooded negro as her
“lover.” Dean Talbot’s wife is the actress’s
only sister.
This is a May Moore study of Mary
Edwards, one of Sydney’s cleverest young
artists. Already she has made her name as
a portrait-
painter, and
she is parti-
cularly happy
in her pic-
tures of child-
hood. With
little black
brother and
sister the
a r tis t has
spent some
years paint-
ing in India
and oth e r
parts of Asia
—or our own
pink and white
babies Mary’s
brush lias a
wizard touch,
and her studio
in Kirkland-
road, Darling-
hurst is radi-
ant with gems
of childhood in all its moods and colors. Her
portrait of Australian writer Jack Abbott
lias just been bought by the Millions Club;
and Nellie Stewart is another celebrity per-
petuated by her art.
There will be quail from Cootamundra
and fruit from the Gosford orchards on the
supper-tables at the Extra Chukka dance on
July 18. The White Pavilion will harbor
the flutter, which is in aid of the Country
Women’s Association. Mrs. Venour Nathan,
who is coining down from Burradoo, will
take the door during the evening in a speci-
ally-edited tango.
The girl in the flat opposite said the other
day that she is getting tired of the race of
Tut. Better, said she, to build flats of
modern limitations for living people than to
break into the gilded and spacious tombs of
the Gyppo dynasty. “Dust to dust,” she
remarked sententiously, dressing her nose as
though it were a billiard cue. Wliat luck
lias loosing the old mummies with tlieir em-
balmed spites brought to anybody? None to
Carter, none to Carnarvon, none to bis lady ;
and even the Tut styles weren’t what you
might call lucky to the f.a.q. girl: only a
Cleo. could look presentable in them. The
girl opposite thereupon over-emphasised her
mouth-line with a searlet lip-stick, mur-
mured reflectively “Ashes to ashes!” dropped
her cigarette just short of the tray, and sped
forth in search of one who had promised her
a flat with a view in Victoria-street.
Slim and fair, looking a true daughter of
the Norscland, Inga Wheeler walked St.
Stephen’s aisle the other night to link up
with Allan Douglas Syme, of Narandera.
The bridegroom is a grandson of the late
David Syme, of Melbourne Age, and Inga is
the youngest daughter of the Walter
Wheelers, of Manly. The Syme clan came
up from Melbourne in force to greet the
pretty bride, and there was a great cheerio
at the Australia afterwards. And after that
again, when Allan and Inga had departed,
Otway Falkiner whisked the guests from the
Australia steps to the Ambassadors to jazz
into the small hours of the morning. ;
The Sydney Hospital workers are plan-
ning two functions against the background
of Uncle Sam’s battleships. On the after-
noon of the 25th a kiddies’ party will inhabit
the P. and O. liner Naldera, and in the even-
ing a ball for grown-ups will be turned on.
Mrs. T. Fiasehi is president of the ball com-
mittee, which includes Premier Lang’s lady,
and Mrs. B. Shand is skipper of the young-
sters’ cheerio.
P. J. Minahan, M.L.A.. bad an early-
morning wedding in the family the other day,
when son Aloysius married Bernardine Stenz.
The knot-tying took the form of a nuptial
mass, and was timed for a quarter to eight
at St. James’s Church in Forest Lodge. Ber-
nardine was a pretty bride, and her froth of
georgette and tulle was followed by three
attractive young ’maids in pink, blue and
mauve velvet frocking.
Lady Carnarvon seems to have been emu-
lating Geraldine Farrar in her determination
to wipe out the memories of past years. Mot
only did she have the whole of the wonderful
Rothschild collection (a gift to herself) auc-
tioned at Christie’s, but in the holocaust she
sacrificed five family portraits. A Joshua
Reynolds group of a certain Elizabeth Coun-
tess of Carnarvon and her infant son was
sold for 9500 guineas. Geraldine hadn’t a
portrait gallery to draw on, but after a
romantic earthquake she sold off everything
in her household, even to clothes, make-up
pots and lipsticks.
Poor Cissie Jamieson, at present creeping
back to health at Bundarbo under the friendly
wing of the newly-returned Mrs. Oliver
Osborne, has had more than her share ot
bereavements. The death of her brother
Sydney was followed by that of her mother,
a fine old lady of 84, who came to Australia
in 1872. Mrs. Jamieson survived her only
sister, Mrs. Crouch, by just 14 days.
Ellis Silas, the painter of the Trobriands,
whispers a word about the last E.A., which
he acclaims as the best for some years,
although some of the portrait-painters revel
in those blue-mouldy flesh tints that are the
latest mode. Orpen’s “Man Versus Beast’’
is, Silas declares, the picture of the year—
good in both composition and color, and full
of the satirical expression of a Hogarth.
The absence of a Brangwyn is deplored, but
the fact that the number of exhibits has
been still further limited has resulted in an
amazingly good show r . Frank Dicksee, now
president of the R.A., is the power behind
the mass of publicity that has proclaimed
this year’s exhibition.
On Thursday morning St. James’s dusted
confetti from its doorsteps where the night
before’s bride and ’groom had passed. They
were Joy Shute, of Potts Point, and John
Dean Stuart, of Ivillara. The dark-haired
bride had enswathed herself in a shimmer of
white and silver, and she was followed by
Enid Minty, of Maoriland, and Joan Bad-
gery, of Scone, whose frocking in its mauves
and blues and lilac pinks suggested a bunch
of sweet-peas. Arthur Ward was best-man,
Roy Stuart was groomsman, and the cake
was cut at the Ambassadors.
The Supreme Court is entering a com-
plaint to the Trades Hall about being worked
overtime. No sooner does it gets its own
daily job cleaned up when Judge Beeby
ushers in a lot of amateur K.C.’s, constables,
witnesses and prisoners, and the rehearsal
for his Honor’s new play, “Point of View,”
is in full swing. The result of the atmo-
spheric effects will be demonstrated at the
Con. on Saturday night by the Players,
directed by Eric Howell.
A note from Brisbane-
The Government House dinner board looked like
a sitting of the Full Court convened to make an
alteration in the Constitution the other night when
five Judges, including Chief-Justice Jimmy Blair,
sat round the chicken. Sir Frederick Dutton, Lieut.-
Colonel and Mrs. Stanley, the C. E. Sligoes, Kathleen
Lilley and other lay folk, however, prevented the
atmosphere getting too thick with legal aphorisms.
The Royal Automobilites had their ball in the
Troeadero. Sir Matthew came in tow of Cecily
Cadell-Garrick and Joan Macdonald. African daisies
decorated a table in the gallery for the vice-regal
supper, and there, was a big roll up of clubites and
their pals.
To buy the sticks for the new Seamen’s Catholic
Club, the old Centennial Hall, which is not heard
of so often nowadays as when it was Brisbane’s chief
dance hall, gathered some three hundred jazzers in
a decoration scheme of blue and gold. The claret
cup and trifle were passed round in Vaughan’s
Jmolan Cafe. Sir Matthew- came along, bringing
with him the P. J. Kerwins, with Captain Turner
on guard. White georgette plus a white camellia
decked Mrs. Toni Ryan; and Mrs. Gillies was in
powder-blue.
Mary Gwendolyn Clapperton said she. would to
Fred S. Lord, eldest son of the Eskdale Lords, at
St. Mark’s, Albion, with the assistance of Rev.
Osborn. Wattle and gum-tips, a suitable setting
for the bush-bred bride, who is a daughter of the
C'lappertons of Tarong, Nanango, decked the church,
and the bride wore white mariette. Lennon's hotel
was filled with roses for the after tamaslia.
In the interests of their club money-box, the
authors and artists danced the other evening amongst
the pictures which adorn the walls of the Anzae
hostelry hall. Old-fashioned numbers crept shyly
back on to the programme, and even University
dons with flying coat-tails found them cheerful.
Mrs. Ted Theodore took all the spare nurses from
the Children’s Hospital to an afternoon at the
pictures. Tea was 'sipped subsequently in the
Wintergarden Cafe.
The Clayfield Memorial School of Arts Library
scooped in some 200 books at the book afternoon
arranged by the women’s committee. Alison Burrell
won first place, Lady Philp donated the prizes, and
Mrs. Fred Tritten handed them out. Afternoon tea
was part of the game.
Thp A.T.N.A. cast off their uniforms, and arranged
a party for the 21st birthday of the branch. Roses
and maidenhair brightened the Albert Hall, and
Misses Chatfield and Barron received the guests. Mrs.
Espie Dods and Ted England helped with
song and music, and Grizei Gibson recited. Madeline
Wright played the piano,? and Florence Hill
fiddled, while Miss Barclay accompanied. Some of
the Brisbane Hospital staff served up the supper.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Harry Connolly’s luck changed violently
in the Grand National Hurdle at Flemington when Sir
Charles fell on the flat, after jumping the second
last obstacle, and brought down Gay Serenade! - and
Fiseom. Sir Charles, who was running prominently
at the time, as also was Gay Sergnader, broke his
back, and a bullet terminated his sufferings. Eric
the Red, Connolly’s other horse, was favorite at
4’s, Rahda being quoted at 9 to 2, Pildin and Gay
Serenader at 8’s, Heke and Btndoc at 10’s, Berrinbo
at 12’s and Sir Charles at IPs. Sir Charles led for
a round, but blundered at the hurdle near the judge’s
box, and Butler then took Pildin to the front. Sir
Charles, Gay Serenader, Fiseom, Heke and Parupa
followed him until the accident which disposed of
Sir Charles, Gay Serenader and Fiseom; Rahda also
suffered in the scrimmage. Pildin led over the last
jump from Parupa, Bendoc, Eric the Red and Rahda,
and, coming away when Butler gave him his head,
he won very easily from Bendoc, last early, and
Rahda, who finished strongly, with Parupa, Eric the
Red, Berrinbo and Jupiter next. Pildin, a five-
year old gelding by Burrabadeen —Perrier, won the
A.J.C. Hurdle last month, and owner T. Davies, trainer
Bert Foulsham and Butler must be a very satisfied
trio. His form over the stiff Flemington course was
vastly superior to what he showed at Moonee Valley,
where Sir Charles ran away from him at the finish
of two miles, but it is explained that Valley condi-
tions did not suit him. Eric the Red was a dis-
appointment. Berrinbo, who had pulled up lame after
a gallop in the morning, shaped respectably. Parupa
is another who may do better presently.
Memories of the famous Tarmoola-Irish Rufus duel
in the Kensington Steeplechase of 1924 were stirred
when Irish Rufus (12’s) was again tackled at the
entrance to the straight in the steeple of that name,
this time by Berribee. It was the most thrilling
race of the afternoon. Berribee gained perceptibly
all the way down the long straight, but Irish Rufus,
desperately ridden by Webster, displayed all his
old gameness and got home by half a length; Silver
Heart was five lengths away. Like Pildin, Irish
Rufus showed a vast improvement on Valley form,
but although he goes down half a stone to list.
71b. in the G. N. Steeple, he hardly seems likely to
trouble Haoma. If anything beats that little cham-
pion it may be Dundalk, a good jumper and sticker
with only lost. 6lb., to carry—he has been running
good races with a lot more. But Haoma, second
in 1924, should go one better this year.
“Hasen”: West Queensland bookies cer-
tainly have their own way of expressing their
disapproval of “dead-uns.” The “Dead March” after
the race incident (B. 25/6/’25) recalls the effort of
one of them before the race. It was at a hospital
meeting at Cloncurry. There were five starters in
the third event, but only one racehorse, one of the
Ninvas progeny so numerous in Queensland, with
Brisbane victories to its credit. Naturally enough,
this—call it Sayalot—opened at 3 to 1 on. Suddenly
a rush came for Deafandum, a hairy country prad that,
groomed, would have done for a trooper’s mount.
Sayalot eased to even money, really a ridiculously
good price, with all the books save one. That one
left his stand, made straight for the stewards’ box,
faced it squarely, and talked directly to the officials.
“Ten to 1 Sayalot!” lie informed them. “Come
on, 12 to 1, 15 to 1, 20 to 1 Sayalot!” And before
the race started he was gravely offering 33 to 1 about
a horse the others quoted at even money. He accom-
plished nothing beyond making his opinion of things
reasonably clear. And he was right. They had
a good strong boy on Sayalot.
Ivaitangata : There is one subject that
Mason, Gloaming's trainer (horse and man are back
111 b T . S. Wales), never reverts to, no matter how
general the conversation, and that is his association
with the once famous and always dangerous stable
of Mason and Vallance, of Christchurch (M.L.).
Mason was the trainer, while Vallance was a book-
maker and a big- operator, too. Away back in the
’eighties Vallance left Christchurch with a team
intended to scoop the pool at the big Auckland
meeting; but he never got there. The ship was the
ill-fated Taiarua. She butted on to that eternal
danger on that trip, Opawa Point, and the waters
closed over poor Bob Vallance and his horses.
A sterling performance was that of Vala-
mita (4’s) in the 10-furlong handicap at the post-
poned Rosehill (N.S.W.) meeting. The sturdy bay
Colt carried 9st. (there was a 6st. 71b. minimum),
and won in clinking style, after shaking off first
Westeiiys (an early winner in suburban company),
Freddie C and Note, the runner-up, to whom he was
conceding 71b. Others behind him were Stony, from
whom he was receiving lib. (there is 101 b. between
them in the Metropolitan), and Dialogue, who two
days later annexed the 11-furlong handicap at 'Canter-
bury Park. There is not a more improved youngster
in the business than Valamita, who is by Valais
(imp.)—Tressamita, and having come through his
winter campaign so well, he may go on and win
the Metropolitan, as did Laddie Blue in similar cir-
cumstances four years ago, and Polyc-letan last year.
Ho has Bst. 2lb. in the big Randwick race, the
same in the Caulfield Cup and 7st. 131 b. in the Mel-
bourne Cup.
* * * *
For a change, most of the winners at Can-
terbury Park (N.S.W.) on Saturday were well backed.
The most interesting of them was Cilix, a three-
year-old bay gelding by Linacre—Lady Capulet, and
therefore a brother to Erasmus, who ran second in
Poitrel’s Melbourne Cup. Erasmus could both sprint
and stay, aud Cilix showed that he could go fast
over six furlongs by donkey-licking a field of platers
in the 1 second division of the Park Stakes. He is
trained bj r Fred Williams, who prepared Erasmus,
and races in the colors of Williams and R. Walder.
* * * *
“Ex-Englishman”: The story (B. 18/6/’25)
of the short-sighted sportsman who collected on
Moneth because somebody had tipped him Monrose in
a different race, recalls an old English yarn spun
round Whitelegs, winner of a big handicap. “A
real good win I had,” said the genial but unintelli-
gent sport at the club afterwards. “Couldn’t miss
it. Had the tip actually thrown at me. The morning
of the race I was shaving, and there was my little
kiddie outside in the garden singing away, that song
about ‘White legs that never grow weary.’ You
couldn’t let a tip like that go unbacked.” “But,
you idiot,” said the crowd, “it’s white icings that
never grow weary, in the song.” “Oh, well, have
it your own way,” said the favorite of Fortune;
“but I went out and took 200 to 10 about it anyway.”
Contrary to general expectation, A. L.
Dunn, who had been the late Byron Moore’s assist-
ant for the past 19 years, failed to secure the V.R.C.
secretaryship. There were 142 applications, and the
committee, after narrowing the field down to two,
preferred the claims of A. V. Kewney, S.A.J.C.
A. V. KEWNEY.
who has succeeded
the late Byron
Moore as secretary
of the V.R.C.
secretary, to those of
the man on whose
shoulders the bulk of
the administrative
work has fallen for so
many years. The new
secretary is a native
of Cheshire, fcngland;
his professional racing
experience began 10
years ago when the
Kalgoorlie R.C. selected
him to take charge of
its meetings. Four
years later, the S.A.J.C.
billet having become
vacant, he moved
higher up the ladder.
Curiously enough, C.
W. Cropper, the A.J.C.
secretary, also gradu-
ated for the job at Kal-
goorlie, and each man
was previously a min-
ing attorney.
The French won all the championships at
Wimbledon —the singles with Lacoste, the doubles
with Lacoste and Borotra, the mixed doubles with
Borotra and Mile. Lenglen, and the women’s singles
with the wonderful Suzanne, who had Miss Ryan for
her partner in the women’s doubles. In the semi-
final of the women’s singles, Suzanne defeated Miss
McKane, last year’s winner (she conquered Miss
Wills, the American), 6 : —o, 6—o. Lacoste wrested
the men’s title from Borotra after four hot sets,
having previously beaten Anderson in straight sets.
The usual excuses have been made for Anderson, but
on this occasion he clearly met his master. And
now the A.L.T.A. is gloomily wondering how much
of its surplus will be left after the Wimbledon busi-
ness and the Davis Cup jaunt. Last year’s Davis
Cup trip resulted in a loss of £1479 18s. 7d.,
“expenses” eating up just £1 19s. 9d. short of
£4OOO. Nearly £lOOO a man.
“Centurion”: The modern fashion of
eulogising one’s own athletic performances in the
press—Tilden began it—has been adopted by Aus-
tralian lawn-tennis luminaries. It promises to spread,
too. Last season one or two Australian cricketers
were tempted to smear themselves and their friends
witli butter in press interviews. In days to come
we may expect to find the personal note introduced
into reports of all sorts of sport. What is to pre-
vent, say, a prominent member of the Papuan Rugby
team which will, no doubt, visit us some day from
holding forth in the style popularised by J. O.
Anderson and his fellows? “I’m frightfully flopped
at lettin’ the dear old Papuan public down to-day,”
said Tearemaneatem, the famous wing-forward of
the All Cannibals. “I felt so fit, too, at the start
and was bringin’ off my forehand drives splendidly.
One of them knocked the opposition breakaway over
his five-eighth’s head. He proved very strong
on his backhand, though removing' three of my
front teeth with his returns. This put me right
off my ground shots, my boot all but missing the
strum-half’s ribs on the two or three occasions I
tried to find touch with him. After I had netted
their right-winger badly in the press table, deai
old Chewislug, our full-back, came up to me. ‘Tear-
em, old man,’ he said, ‘we mustn’t slack; those
two last men you tackled got up again without
ambulance assistance.’ But it was too late, too
late. Our opponents were terribly bucked in the
second half, and kept our stretcher parties on the
run till the final whistle. I’ve no excuses; they
were the bigger savages on the day.”
“Shrewsbury”: After again winning his
way into the semi-finals of the Diamond Sculls at
Henley, Gollan, the indefatigable Maorilander, once
more succumbed to the English champion, J. Beres-
ford, who had previously defeated Hoover, the Ameri-
can, in the other semi-final. Beresford is rated as
the best amateur sculler now rowing, and last season
won the champion gold cup at Philadelphia. This
has occasioned a curious exercise of discipline by
the haughty English Amateur Rowing Association.
The Yanks, of course, claim that the Philadelphia
race is the world’s sculling championship, and the
cup is inscribed to that effect. When it heard this,
the E.R.A. informed America in a strangled voice
that there could be only one possible world’s scull-
ing championship, and that was the Diamond Sculls at
Henley. Then it ordered Beresford to send the
demned cup back, which the obedient youth promptly
did. All the same, if the E.R.A. imagines this will
prevent the Yanks claiming this or any other cham-
pionship it is vastly mistaken. Writer can recollect
a cartoon in New York Judge showing Uncle Sam
as world’s cricket champion, after the Philadelphia
C.C. had beaten a touring team of the English
Incogniti club.
* * * *
A Goodsell-Saul match for the world’s
sculling championship has been arranged for July
25. Saul is labelled the best man Northern N.S.W.
has produced, with the exception of Searle and Paddon,
and the Northern Rivers will back him solidly.

Charlie Purdy, the young Auckland ex-
amateur who fought at Paris last year, made his
Sydney Stadium debut on Saturday night before a
small and hostile crowd. He was opposed by the
Rozelle lightweight, Jimmy Allen, to whom he
administered a severe hiding, winning almost every
round. Purdy overdid the ducking business, and
Allen hugged and hung on persistently, so that be-
tween them they made it a rather monotonous exhibi-
tion. Referee Joe Wallis declared it a draw, much
to the relief of a noisy section from west o’ Darling
Harbor. Purdy is a beautifully-built lad, who has
grown inches since lie was here as an amateur and
captured the Australasian title; but he will have
to cultivate a punch. In an animated ten-rounder
A 1 White, otherwise known as “Splinter,” hit Eddie
Watson with everything but the clock and made him
stop in the seventh round. A 1 has been fighting
for at least 12 years, and for one of such frail
physique (he weighs only 1071 b.) is marvellously
enduring. Watson was tipped as a coming bantam
champion three years ago, but, like Jack Green, he
began too young, aud two or three 20-round contests
settled his prospects.
* * * *
Both the 10-round bouts at Melbourne
Stadium on Saturday were interesting up to a point,
and gave a moderate house value for its money. In
the affair between Ben Martin (9st. 21b.) and Dick
Congress (Bst. 121 b.) it was Martin -who showed
most initiative; but after six rounds he appeared
satisfied to rest on an obvious points’ advantage
which won him the honors, Congress being unable to
make up the lost leeway. The verdict in favor of
Charley Pilkington (9st. 91b.) at the conclusion of
his 10 rounds with Bert McCarthy (9st. 711 b.) led
to a demonstration, the crowd protesting that Bert
was the victor. There was certainly very little be-
tween them, but this Page won’t argue against the
referee’s decision.

The inter-State hockey tourney came to
an end in Sydney last Saturday, when Queensland
easily beat South Australia, 12-0, and N.S.W.
accounted for Victoria, after a hard and fast game,
by 2 goals to 1. Earlier in the week the Victorians
had beaten Queensland by 4 goals to 2. The result
Was indefinite, Victoria, Queensland and N.S.W. tieing
with 2 wins and 1 loss each. No agreement had been
made to deal with such a situation, and matters
will have to stand in this unsatisfactory position
until next year. Had a goal average been taken
N.S.W. would have been the winners.
The inter-State competition arranged by
the Australian-rules people after last year’s Hobart
tournament has produced some exciting football. On
June 20 South Australia’s crack XVIII beat the
elect of Westralia at Subiaco by 3 points—B goals
9 behinds to 7 goals 12 behinds. Returning to Adel-
aide, Golding’s men met the pride of the Victorian
League at the Adelaide Oval, where 34,000 people
passed through the turnstiles, and again snatched
a 3-point win—ll goals 11 behinds to 11 goals 8
behinds. The Victorians were handicapped by an
injury to Colin Watson, the best of their backs, in
the third quarter, but the Croweaters showed splendid
form. They are to meet the Gropers again at
Adelaide on August 1, play a return match with the
Victorians at Melbourne on August 15, and encounter
the Tasmanians at Adelaide on August 29, and one
success will bring the championship to their State.
While Victoria’s first XVIII was going down at
Adelaide a second team took on N. S. Wales at
the Melbourne C. G. At the end the Gumsuckers
owned 130 points to the Cornstalks’ 89, and the
locals might have doubled their score had they
been so minded. The Ma Staters couldn’t mark,
couldn't catch a healthy worm, and exhibited not
even the rudiments of system.

“G. 0.8.” : Dave McNamara (B. 2/7/’2sj
is the one Melbourne footballer who deserves to
have premiership flags flying over his own back door.
In 1905 he .was lured from the bush by Stoush Mel-
bourne and dropped as a dud, to become a champion
at once for St. Kilda. When in his lusty prime he
transferred to Essendon Association, and won them
premierships off his own boot. Six feet four inches
high and nearly I6st., yet agile as a cat, he was
the perfect footballer, and in any position dominated
all opponents. When the arms that spanned Oft.
Sin. horizontally shot into the air the mark was
generally his, and the resultant kick something to
be wondered at. In exciting games Dave would fill
all the key positions. It was no unique feat for
him to kick off from one end, rush to the centre
and take the pass, and then bag a goal. His total
of 107 goals in 1912 is the State’s best, and his
long-kicking has never been excelled. He has man-
aged 84yds. and 86yds. in public exhibitions, and
90yds. on several occasions in matches. He has kept
himself fit this year by playing- with the book-
makers, and if he could bring himself to take the
comparatively inactive post of full-back at North
Melbourne, he might still be a star in League
company.

South Sydney’s defeat of North Sydney
by 15 to 10 practically made the Rugby
League premiership South’s property. The scrambling,
untidy game was not nearly worth the money that
SON OF FOOTBALLER: “ ’Oo, dad! What
team do those horses play for?”
the 20,000 spectators—the best attendance of the
season at a club match—paid at the gates. South
was always on top and deserved to lead by more
than 5—4 at half-time. In the second spell North
went to pieces for a time, but came with a rattle
after many fed-up barrackers had gone home. For
the winners, Wearing scored a try and two goals
(7 points), and lifted his aggregate to 63 points
in eight matches. Western Suburbs and Glebe had
an exciting tussle, West getting home by 14—13.
Balmain downed St. George, 15—11; and Eastern
Suburbs trod on ’Varsity, 11—8. South has a long
lead, with 18 points against North’s 13 and Bal-
main’s 12.
* * * *
A crowd of about 25,000 saw the Eng-
lish Soccer eleven defeat Australia in the second
Test at the Sydney Showground by 2 goals to 1.
The reorganised Australian XI made a respectable
showing, though it was evident that there are
still one or two weak spots. The side lost Sherring-
ham from the wing in the second half; on the other
hand, one of Batten’s shots hit the post, and there
were many narrow misses, the visitors being much
less accurate in their shooting than usual. Eng-
land had to play Spencer, a half-back, at full, and
stood down a couple of others through injury.
Spencer was not a success, and practically made
Smith, the new centre, a present of Australia’s goal.
The home team’s outstanding player was Cartwright,
who again did some astonishingly clever work in
goal, while Gallen was in excellent form at back, and
was well aided by the Tasmanian, Faulkner. But
the forwards again failed in combination, and Smith
was very disappointing at centre. The Australian halves,
with Spurway conspicuous, defended finely, but failed
in keeping their attack in motion, whereas the Eng-
lish half-back line provided an almost perfect exhibi-
tion of how to set forwards moving, Sage, Hamilton
and Graham holding the balance of attack and
defence for England all through the game. Charlton
was as solid as ever at right-back, and Hannaford,
on the right wing, Simms and Elkes were the best
of the English forwards. Batten being off his game
for once. So far the tourists have won against all-
comers, and have scored 101 goals to 7.
* * * •»
“Centurion”: After all, Tom Lawton, the
Queensland Rhodes scholar, will not be lost to
Union football, for he has decided to stay in N. K.
Wales, and will play with Western Suburbs. He
had intended to settle in his native State, and
would probably have played League football. The
row that his participation in the professional code
with Brisbane University got him into in England
is written in bright blue letters in the annals of
the game. Though Tom’s explanation was accepted,
he was studiously passed over by the English selec-
tors, albeit he was the best five-eighth of his day
in England. He was included in the last match
against the All Blacks at Manly last week, and his
splendid form indicated that N.S.W. has found the
five-eighth for whom the selectors have been looking.
“Past Grammar”: Like “Young Happy"
Evre, the rising golf “pro.” (B. 25/6/’25), “Old
Happy, so well known to Manly surfers, was a
notable Rugby player in his day. The original
“Happy” was a fine forward, and as likeable a
humorist as ever kept a touring team in a good
temper. He reached his apogee with the N.S.W.
side which toured Maoriland in 1894, and for "years
afterwards almost the first question asked of Aus-
tralian teams after landing in M.L. was “How’s
‘Happy’ Eyre?” AH sorts of football legends were
tacked on to his genial personality.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: R. H. Bettington. the
sometime King’s School (N.S.W.) googlie bowler and
Oxford and England Rugby forward, is having a good
season in English county cricket. Plaving for Middle-
sex he has an average with the bat of 21 (good work
for a pure hitter), and has taken 32 wickets for an
average of 11.34. He has been invited to play in
the Gentlemen-Players match. In addition to cricket
and football, the old Parramattan has played golf
for Oxford, a rather unusual treble.
DANGEROUS CALLINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In the Central Court, Sydney, the captain of a
Itugby League club was fined £5 and costs for
a violent assault on the referee. Counsel for the
complainant remarked that it was becoming very
difficult to secure referees on account of similar
happenings.”
“Come in, my crippled friend, come in,”
I hailed him by the tavern door,
"You’re short a leg and shy a fin.
I’ll bet you lost them in the war.
Come, while a heartening nip they pour
Tell me of Mons and Pozieres.”
He hobbled o’er the polished floor;
“I can’t,” he said, “I wasn't there.”
A scar from occiput to chin
And other battle marks he bore.
He heaved a sigh and sank a gin.
1 wondered what his ear had tore
And slewed his nose nor’-cast-by-nor'.
Was lion-taming his affair?
Of laurels had he earned a store
Where bruisers bold their biceps bare?
He shook his head, the nips between.
Said I; “If I can read aright
You have the modest hero’s mien,
Beside your anatomic plight,
For sign of many a stubborn fight,
Of dogged pluck the guarantee.”
He nodded as he struck a light
And puffed a blackened G.B.D.
“’Tis plain,” I said, “you oft have been
Where passions seethe and strong arms smite,
Knee-deep in many a bloody scene
That few would view without affright.
Cut off from chance of help or flight
Odds you have faced unflinchingly?”
He acquiesced, “I have, too right,
1 was a Rugby referee!”

Shave in Comfort.
ft
m
If you could sha-e
yourself in three min-
utes as well as the
barber does, wouldn’t
you rather always do
so than waste valuable
time at a barber’s
shop ?
Then try a PERFOR-
ATED HONE. It puts easy
shaving within reach of every
man. Requires no skill or
experience to use. Give six
strokes or a hundred—you
can’t hurt your razor, for the
perforations prevent WIRE-
EDGE, and automatically
produce a perfect, keen shaving edge.
TRI ONE. If it doesn’t make your
razor shave to your satisfaction return
it to us within 30 days and get your
money back.

THE INKY WAY.
A.J.A.X. A writer whose nane now appears
«-eek by week in Melbourne Leader over a brand of
humorous article is Esme Johnston, the dainty girl
who was Florine in “The Lady” during Pauline
Frederick’s Melbourne season, and who was formerly
on the Melbourne Sun. The Leader was never noted
ior its laughter-provoking prose, if one excepts the
weekly budget of reprinted jests from overseas, and
its departure from its old habits is quite an event.
Christchurch (M.L.) newspaper owners apparently
don t think literary men are necessarily fools in
business. Following on editor Huie’s appointment
as manager of the Christchurch Sun comes news of
the transfer of A. M. Burns, chief sub-editor of
Christchurch Press to the post of manager His
position will be filled by V. White, who had a turn
i offices as well as on M.L. Hansard before
joining Sydney Sun. Afterwards lie hopped back
to M.L. and the Press.
Keighley Goodchild. who published his “While the
Billy Boils” in 1883, and who was the subject of
a recent Inky Way par. (B. 23/‘4/’25), left a sister,
Mrs. J. Denny, of Brisbane. She tells The Bulletin
that the Keighley Goodchild who is the new chief of
London. Standard cannot be that other Keighley
Goodchild’s son, because he died unmarried at Echuca
(Vic.) in 1888. Mrs. Denny says that much of her
brother’s work has hitherto been unpublished in
book form, but that there is a probability of a
collected edition.
“Cartot”: Passed out the other day in a Sydney
hospital, one of this country’s profoundest scholars,
James Collier, at one time a regular contributor to
most of. the leading reviews in England and Scotland.
1 or a time he worked with Herbert Spencer, and two
of the volumes in Spencer’s monumental work on
comparative sociology were contributed by him.
When his health broke down, more than 20 years ago,
he went to Maoriland ; later he came to Sydney, and
in the seclusion of his home at Manly wrote what
he could on his favorite subjects.
“Miro”: Just published, by her husband, Julian
Grande, the life of Constance Barnicoat, Maoriland’s
most distinguished woman journalist. She was born
in Nelson, and after a brilliant school career and a
brief experience as a stenographer in Wellington
went to London and obtained a position with W. T.
Stead on the Review of Reviews. She was success-
ful in many lines, particularly as a war corres-
pondent, for her linguistic abilities were remarkable.
Mountaineering was her recreation, and her clever
pen recounted her experiences on both sides of the
world.
“lan C.”: Melbourne Herald’s victory in the art
libel-suit brought by Captain Falcke has reminded old
paperstainers that the journal had a big win 30 years
ago when Downie, a contractor for gaol-building at
Pentridge, sued it for £15,000 damages. Downie
put in a big bill for extras, which led to the Herald
pitching into him and commenting upon the dis-
appearance and reappearance of inspectors’ diaries.
Sam Winter, who was then in charge of the evening
sheet, provoked a. smile in court when he related
that upon Downie coming to him and claiming
£15,000 he asked him if he would be inclined to
give a discount for cash. Sam hated libel actions,
but when he had to fight he went at it with a
will.
“Kazan’’: Sydney Sun is getting a strong American
touch in its method of obtaining news scoops. The
other day a divorce case was set down for hearing,
but seemed likely to be held over till next sitting
of the Court. However, the paper had everything
set up in anticipation by 3 p.m. At 3.C5 the case
was unexpectedly heard. The Judge (Owen) being
satisfied with the petitioner’s plea, very little evi-
dence was called, and the detectives outside waited
in vain to be called into the witness-box. However,
when the petitioner stepped into the street the
case .was in the hands of the news-vendors, much
prominence being given to the stories of the three
detectives—who had not been wanted! As the peti-
tioner who had much appreciated the Judge’s con-
sideration in dispensing with unpleasant witnesses, I
feel entitled to a kick.
“Baannutha”: “Morehead” is not quite correct in
his statement (B. 14/5/’25) that Vance Marshall
“did a term at Long Bay over the Freeman case.”
Vance was awarded four months’ hard labor for
speeches likely to promote disaffection to the King
at the close of the 1917 strike. The sentence was
served at Long Bay and Goulburn, and a book
“Jail from Within” was one of the results. In
1918 he was further sentenced to six months’ im-
prisonment for having prejudiced recruiting. This
term was served at Long Bay and Albury gaols.
Following his release. Marshall put his impressions
into “The World of the Living Dead,” with a pre-
face by Henry Lawson (both books may be found in
the Mitchell Library). In 1919 he was sentenced
to six months’ hard labor for his part in the Paul
Freeman riot, but Judge Cohen, on appeal, suspended
the sentence, and instead of going to gaol on this
occasion Vance went into business in Brisbane, where
he has remained until lately. Meanwhile he has
again taken up the pen, and his “Life and Memoirs
of Henry Lawson” will be published next year in
England.
“Julia Jongbolt”: While the devils of high finance
chase the ghosts of dead ambitions through the empty
corridors of the Sun (Melb.), it is a melancholy
thing to call the roll of the original members of
the Pictorial stuff in its new home. Only seven
are left. Blanche Jones, for many years “Falaise,”
of the Australasian, still writes pleasant things
about hostesses and their guests. Nina Murdoch,
whose verse and paragraphs The Bulletin discovered
some 11 years ago, is on the general staff. Thorold
Waters remains as “The Salamander” and musical
critic, and another erstwhile Bulletin contributor,
Jimmy Brown, has slipped from news editor to
deputy. Reg Kempton, the only reporter to get
through to the Wilshire wreck off the M.L. coast,
still looks after the pictures; Crayton Burns and
H. E’. Fenton (commercial) are also among the
salvaged. Gordon Kennedy, than whom no one
did more for the success of the Pic., is
back in his old job on the Sydney Sun.
Chief-sub. Tom Fitzgerald left soon after the change-
over to edit the Countryman and the farmers’ daily
(Morning Post) when the latter comes to the start-
ing-post. The latest departure is Norman Sharpe
(“Vigilant”), who has joined the racing staff of
the Sydney Sun. The others are scattered from
Perth (W.A.) to Bundaberg (Q.). Monty Grover
has become a sort of Lord High Admiral of the
Herald’s fleet of weeklies.
“Canar”: One matter overlooked by a recent writer
in his article on freelancing in Australia was that
of getting the money for contributions after they
have been published. With the exception of The
Bulletin, which pays immediately on publication,
or earlier in some cases, I don’t know a paper in
the Commonwealth which remits in less than 10
days or a fortnight, while some take three months.
Not long ago I posted a batch of paragraphs and
short articles to an American technical journal,
sending them away four days before a number of
my pars, appeared in an Australian weekly. Although
the claim for the latter was sent in the week
they appeared, I received the two cheques within
a few days of each other, it taking the local weekly
just as long to pass the claim and forward the
cheque as it took for the other matter to go to
America and the money in payment to come back.
Quite recently my accumulated accounts with one
well-known journal ran to more than £l5, and
when I did receive payment some of it was 10
weeks overdue. Sometimes the remissness of papers
may make all the difference between an early
success and a failure. A few days ago I was shown
a list of overdue accounts by a young lady who.
having become suddenly faced with the necessity
for earning her living, had essayed to do so through
freelance journalism. The list covered a period of
about two months, and the total of the payments
due was £l4. In a way it represented the failure
of her attempt, for had she received what was due
week by week, she would have got enough to live
on, instead of the impossible few shillings a week
which had actually come in.

lit “The Street Singer,” now showing at
Tier Majesty’s, Sydney, Frederick Lonsdale,
who takes long walks and hot water for 1
dyspepsia in an English coastal town, has
spread a repast that will not tax the weakest
stomach. It is also a pleasant sedative for
the nation’s nerves, set painfully vibrating by
a long course of American jazz comedies. ±he
lower tempo at which the play is set enables
Gladys Moncrieff to display a voice instead
of a high kick, and Noel Leyland, Claude
Flemming and others to throw attitudes in-
stead of hand-springs; and a total absence
of the awful gagging which many American
playwrights substitute for humor enables
Arthur Stigant and Leslie Holland to in-
dulge in acting instead of knock-about farce.
As Bonni, a young and disregarded artist,
Noel Leyland makes a moderately effective
hero, though he has to struggle to maintain
his position all the evening against the at-
tacks of Claude Flemming, whom long habit
has accustomed to the role. The action o
Yvette, a street-singer partially disguised as
Gladys Moncrieff, in buying with her scanty
coin one of the hero’s canvases unknown
to him, puts Bonni on his financial and artis-
tic legs again. He abandons Byrl \\ alkely
(who, as the sulky model, Marie, acted con-
"SPRING OLEANING." AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Archie Wells (Charles Coleman) listens un-

Richard Sones (Mayne Lynton).
sistently), and transfers his affection to
Yvette in the process of transferring her
features to canvas. The arrival in the middle'
of an artists’ ball of an invitation from a
duchess, is, as usual, too much tor the sus-
ceptible artist, who abandons Yvette and
rushes off in haste to have a look at the
latest patron. Needless to say. she is the
street-singer, having adopted the disguise to
help the struggling artist, and the stratagem
of the invitation to test his affection. At
this stage Claude Flemming was obviously
laboring under the delusion that the play-
wright intended him to succeed to the
duchess; but a timely hit of eavesdropping
on the part of the lady brought the usual
reconciliation and circumvented lnm. *
H. Fraser-Simson and Ivy St. Helier have
provided some pleasing melodies which the
principals adequately interpreted, though
Noel Leyland’s voice fell a trifle * short.
Arthur Stigant characterised excellently a
man-servant who hates women, and Nellie
Payne laid herself out very brightly to prove
to "him that there are exceptions. Playing
with audacity and vim, Yera Spaull made a
sparkling bit of comedy out of the part ot
Estelle in the first act; the clever little lady
deserved a longer run. The lengthy waits
between the acts are an annoyance winch
the extraordinary system of lighting em-
ployed in this theatre makes no easier.

A Scotch comedian named Harry Lauder
is at present performing at the Theatre
Royal, Sydney. He is a highly original
humorist who deserves more than the passing
references accorded to him in the newspapers.
This Page takes no credit for especial
sapiency in having discovered him. His
talent is indubitable, and might be said
almost to amount to genius. A large audi-
ence who had doubtless dropped in to see an
average vaudeville entertainment was sur-
prised and delighted at his address. Cer-
tainly his lyrics had a curiously familiar
ring, and some of his quips, like Shakspeare s,
had the air of being quotationsalso his
dancing, which resembled the antics of an
amiable but gouty elephant, fell far short ot
the gymnastic standards expected on the
variety stage nowadays: but his characterisa-
tions of an Edinboro’ schoolboy, a buildiog
contractor, a British tar, a Hielan laddie
and other well-worn subjects had a qui.e
delightful freshness absent from the
machine-made humor we have been try-
inf to get accustomed to lately. 1 ro-
phesying is a thankless and dangerous pas-
time, but we venture to predict that Harry
Lauder will go far. Associated with him
are some capable supports, including Ilarrj
Moore, who tears up paper and achieves
extraordinary effects.

A Glasgow man informs us that the com-
edian is 90 years of age or thereabouts, and
delighted millions of discerning people before
we were born. Ah, well, the world moves,
but it doesn’t seem to get any forwarder.
From Czecho-Slovakia there came last

thetic men and women called Robots, lhe
curtain rises on the office of the factory

work, and the arrival of Helena Glory bent
upon improving their lot. 1 his is effected
by a change in the ingredients used which
converts the factory products from obedient
serfs into ravening rebels. Helena having
obligingly destroyed the secret of their manu-
facture, they storm the factory, and eventu-
ally massacre all mankind save one. Three
years later their troubles begin. \\ hat they
'are Sydney should go and see for itself-
“R.U.R.” is as exciting as any melodrama,
and a powerful satire withal. Duncan Mac-
dougall, in addition to producing the -play,
portrayed the many-sided Domain skilfully.

Clemence Dane’s sombre “Bill of Divorce-
ment” was staged by the Repertory Players
at the Melbourne Playhouse on Saturday.
The Repertorians had an initial misfortune in
the sudden illness of the consistently valu-
able Charles Row, whose place had to bo
taken by George Faulkner. In the cir-
cumstances. George did well, but gh>°m
seemed inclined to sit on the performance
even before the action justified its presence.

A Belligerent Painter: —
Amiable in nature, Max Meldrum is so
in paint that he is apt in the dust of battle t
forget everything but the joy of fighting. That, at
„., v ra t e j s the impression gained from some ot his
Australian landscapes at the Athenamm Hall, Melbourne
in which everything seems to have been sacrificed u>
realism. There is much besides, however which is
appealing, notably “Silver Morning” (No. 10), which
is full of poetic feeling; the vivid Sunshine and
Rain” (No 24) and a study of “Iceland 1 oppies.
V sketch for a portrait of Fritz Hart has liveliness

cm an occasion which Kreisler left, vacant. A
\ cry large audience showed its appreciation of
the opportunity of listening to a creditable
interpretation of the composer who delighted
in tremendous climaxes. The orchestra’s best
work was done in the “Siegfried Idyll,
which was gracefully rendered, and in the
introduction to the third act of “Lohengrin ;
but “The Flying Dutchman” was a mere
tumult of sound, in which the basses and
the strings proclaimed undying hatred. The
eor anglais solo in the Prelude _to Act 111
of “Tristan and Isolde” was feelingly played
by Dr. .7. F. liudall.
“No. No, Nanette,” at the Princess’s,
seems likely to prove the best Hugh Ward
investment to date. A brighter show has not
been seen in Melbourne for ages.
Battalions of Melbourne people are going
to “Let’s do,” at the Athenamm, and making
nightly demands upon Lee White for extras.
The smiling dame supplies them with a
cheerful generosity.
Another inspection of "Secrets,” at the
Melbourne Royal, strengthens the impression
that it is an altogether likeable play, and
that Muriel Starr has a part which tits her
like a glove.
There have been additions to the novelties
of the “Snap” revue at the Melbourne New
Palace, notably a Grecian song ballet,
“Calypso,” a very amusing encounter be-
tween a stage aspirant (Vivian Carter) and
an entrepreneur (James Grant) on the
Thames embankment, and “The Dancing
Doll” —a bit of drollery that keeps the laugh-
ter fizzing. But the orchestra needs some
improvement. A first impression of Duffield s
music was that it was extremely bright; but
the orchestra contrives now and then to vex
the mind with doubts.
From the moment that Harry Green
stepped on to the stage at the Melbourne
Tivoli to announce that his name was George
Washington Cohen and that, as long as ic
told no lies, he had hopes of some day being
President of the United States, he had the
audience with him in everything he did.
There is nothing of the knockabout lid
comedy in Green’s work : in a bright little
thing called “The Cherry Tree” he lays the axe
of truth to the roots of a matrimonial tangle,
and knocks the fruit of spontaneous laughter
from all branches of the theatre. Such
sparkles as “Know him? Vliy, I vorked for
10 minutes at the place vere he steals Ins
money” came quite naturally. His support
in the sketch is up to requirements. Iris and
Phyllis are a buoyant pair, and Fred Bluett,
Keith Desmond and Ernest Hastings help to
fill up a good-weight programme, in which
one irritating item can be ignored.
George Wallace and his merry men —and
girls—show some of their best form to date
in “Some Night,” the Bijou frivolity for this
week; and Wallace at Ms best is very enter-
taining indeed. This will be the last week
of the Foy Brothers, who have been doing
much the usual thing on the horizontal-bars ;
but Vieta Burke will be forgiven if he stays
sbme time. He owns a pleasing baritone.
A movie version of “Welcome, Stranger,
is screened this week at Melbourne Majestic,
and the battle of Issy Solomon (whose bread
is cast on the waters and comes back as sand-
wiches) with graft influences over a muni-
cipal lighting contract is the body of an in-
teresting story. “A Good-Bad Wife lends
support. Hoyt’s Do Luxe feature a D. v\ •
Griffiths’ story of “Love and Sacrifice, and
Hoot Gibson provides a counterblast ot action
in “Hurricane Kid.” At Hoyt’s New. Gaiety
“The Ten Commandments” is running for
a second week.

A parade of the two-year-olds:—
The work of students of the N.S.W. Royal Art
Society, now showing at Vickery’s Chambers, Pitt-
street, Sydney, is as much as anything an indictment
of contemporary teaching. When Julian Ashton hac
most of the rearing of Australian artists, the infants
were not allowed to suck a paint-brush until they
had learnt to handle a stick of charcoal; and a
craving for print was regarded as a sign of hereditai,
depravity. Nowadays the process appears to have
been reversed, with lamentable results. Even being
born of very holy artistic lineage and in an odor
of Indian ink and burnt sienna does not exempt the
craftsman from the necessity of learning the rudi-
ments of his craft. Ray Lindsay, for instance,
has gained a first prize for a lunette decoration
which, while it shows some of his distinguished
parent’s power of marshalling figures, is very badly
drawn and painted. HA other contributions show-
qualities of imagination allied to the same hasty
workmanship. Lindsay IXpyle in a series of caii-
catures also refuses to acknowledge that he has
limitations or that David Low owns any copyright
in the pictorial representation of W. M. Hughes. D.
Toovey has a landscape that shows feeling, and
Miss E. G. Kane has some very competent still-
lifes • but in the drawing section, where the student
should show the mettle of his pasture, there is
nothing particularly worthy of remark^

“Flaming Youth”: The stage girl had
some remarks to offer concerning a much-
married star. “I think it’s perfectly putrid
the way those newspapers keep mentioning
her former husbands,” she protested. You
know what I mean —‘Fysick Fairbrow,
Brenda Braithwaite’s fifth husband, lias
gone to Reno again’; or ‘Brenda Braith-
waite’s third husband has married his six at
wife.’ As if Brenda could help it! She had
to have those husbands.” “Had to have
them?” I repeated. “Well, she had to have
them if she wanted to keep respectable, ’ the

“Well, what is it?"
PASSER-BY : “Dear me, don't you know your
self?”
lady explained. And as she comes from
Brenda’s country she may be in a position
to know.
“Hamfat”: So far from wearing out its
welcome, “On Our Selection” appears to be
growing in popularity with Australian audi-
ences. " The present tour has been as success-
ful as any in the 14 years’ history of the
play, and one week of the Melbourne season
was the best yet experienced from the box-
office point of view. Higher prices had some-
thing to do with that; but there is signifi-
cance in the fact that the day when a dinkum
Australian production had to appeal with
cheaper rates is gone.
“W.E.F.”: “F.T.K.” (B. 2/7/’25) accuses
Duncan Macdougall of reserving for lumselr
the big parts in his Sydney Playbox produc-
tions. Far from being a glutton tor lime-
light, Duncan has, during his two years m
Sydney, practised a rare self-effacement. In
“Masses and Man” he relinquished the fat
part of the Nameless Man for that oi Soma.
In “The Adding Machine” lie impersonated
Zero, a mere cypher. Nor did he cast him-
self for any of the big roles in Morality'
or “R.U.R.”—-Dr. Homer and Baron Smith-
son in “Morality”; Radius and Dr.
Gall in the Czecho-Slovak play. Mac-
Dougall’s primary consideration has always
been the production, and “F.T.K.’ as alone
in denying the man versatility. r.l.iv.
mentions “physical disabilities, but what
does he want? A matinee idol as Yank
in “The Hairy Ape”?
“Bouragi” : The clumsy hand of Hollywood
is evident in a cable dealing with the cap-
ture of that famous film star, Miss Bluestone
Blithers, by the savage Bedouins of I ales-
tine. Miss Blithers was engaged in film-
making when the sheik and his attendant
fleas swooped down on her and held her to
ransom. It seems that the kings ot the
desert were offended because the lady was
appearing in a film entitled “The Princess
of Pawnticket,” or words to that effect, they
having previously elevated the said Princess
to the job of Tribal Deity, which, of course,
is just what one would expect of fanatical
Mohammedans —if one hailed from Hollywood
It will work out a ripping ad., no doubt, but 1
am sorry for Miss Blithers if she had to put
in a short stav in the camel-hair tent of her
princely captor. The writer spent live
minutes under one once, and the experience
has not been erased —not to say scratched
—from his recollection to this day.
“T O.I.” : In a notice of the death of G. L.
Goodman, a Sydney writer mentions the
time when John Bennett had the old Victoria
Theatre in Pitt-strcet, and asserts that the
cafe known as the Ambassadors now occu-
pies the site. The old Vic. stood where
now is McCathie's drapery warehouse. As
I fretted my little hour upon its boards 1
ought to know.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Willie Driscoll, one of
the six originals in the “On Our Selection
show —h e has been Uncle from the beginning
__dates his theatrical history back to Mrs.
G. B. W. Lewis’s juvenile comic-opera co.
He was Dick Deadeye in a production ot
“Pinafore.” The Driscoll brothers, once very
well known in vaudeville, are nephews.
“Hamfat”: Australia is used to mature
Juliets —much too mature in some cases
but it once had a Signorina Capulet who was
only a few months older than the tempestu-
ous flapper of Shakspeare’s imagination. 1 hat
was Rosa Dunn, daughter of the John Dunn
who figured in its early theatrical history.
She was barely 15 when she appeared at the
Cremorne Gardens, Richmond (Vic.), which
George Coppin opened in 1856, two ot the
other women being Rose Edouin and Julm
Matthews. Rose Edouin married G. B. \V.
Lewis, who in 1854 had opened Astlcy s
Amphitheatre on the site where now is the
Princess’s. L. L. Lewis, of the flowing whis
kers, captured the heart of Rosa Dunn, and,
married in her ’teens, she left the stage.
Julia Matthews went to London and made a
hit. So, after many years, did Rose Ldoum.
There are Diggers who saw .this wonderful
oM lady play Mrs. Quickly m The Meny
Wives of Windsor” at Stratford : on-Avon in
1916- and three years later, being then in
her 76th year, she appeared with Dot Brun-
ton in “The Bantam V.C.” at the St. Mai-
tin's. Just on 68 years before she had
acted, as the child in “The Stranger, with
G. V. Brooke. She is still alive, I believe.
“C.K.” recalls some understudies: —
Generally speaking, understudies are treated bt
their principals in a friendly and helpful spirit (b.
2/7/’25), but the rule was departed from in the case
of a co. which produced “The Belle of New V ork in
Australia at the close of the nineteenth century The
lady who understudied Louise Hepner as the Belle
was Mabelle Darlev, an Australian. On her first
appearance in the part every obstacle was placed m
her way. The wig was not to be found, and the
costumes were distributed so as to render their proper
assemblage difficult. In addition, a member of the
co who had been superseded as Harry Bronson by
myself sat in the stalls and tried to guy Mabelle s
show. ’ It used to be the practice not to distribute
understudy parts of a new piece until after the
first performance. The folly of this was shown at
the Savoy on the production of the “revised” version
of Offenbach’s “Grand Duchess,” with the late
Florence St. John in the name part. Shortly before
the performance, Florence Perry, the Wanda of the
production (Australia saw her in “The Geisha ), was
taken 111, and there was no understudy. A little
American chorister, Ethel Jackson, told producer
Bichard Barker that she had been watching the
rehearsals and thought she could get through. This
she did very creditably. Some years ago in Mel-
bourne at the first performance after many years
of a certain Gnoert and Sullivan opera, one of the
principal performers could not be located. A member
of the chorus went on with the book and score in
his hands and, to some extent, saved the situation.
“N.F.”The return to Australia of the
former opera .star Annie Leaf awakes mem-
ories. A native of Auckland, where her
brother was a photographer, Miss Leaf, the
brother—a little man with a iarge bass voice
—Signor Tom Ricardi (otherwise lhomas
Richards), old Buixetin contributor J. a.
Crain, Charlie Harding and Tottie Teague
figured in a famous production of ’ l inafore
at the Auckland Theatre, the firs in Aus-
tralasia Annie Leaf, Riccardi and Ilarding
were snapped up by the Williamson. Oramer
and Musgrove firm at Gisborne on their way
back to Auckland after a tour of the southern
provincial centres; and their subsequent suc-
cesses in Australia are Australian opera his-
tory! I was a member of their mixed pro.
and amateur eo., and had the honor of teach
ing Annie and Tottie how to put up their
dukes when they sang about a British tar
being a soaring soul, and demonstrated tlia
“this should be his customary attitude.
GOOD IMITATING.
THE POET : “I got my inspiration from the
Wihl songbirds in the far mountain
gullies.”
THE EDITOR : “Ah, yes, I can see the lyre-
bird influence all through it.”
“Caesar’s Ghost” : I wonder what has be-
come of Minnie Tittell Brune and Clarence,
her husband. Clarence had stage ambitions
which Minnie discouraged, but he made two
splashes into the pool of theatrical manage-
ment in this country, both disastrous. Ite‘
gardless of his spouse, he produced “Hamlet
at Newcastle —Clarence was Hamlet—in-
tending to take his Market-street, ’Frisco,
version of Shakspeafe on to Maoriland. The
co. got no further than the Coal City. Clar-
ence’s other effort was at the Sydney Cri-
terion, in partnership with another ambi-
tious neophyte—a bank clerk who financed
the show. The play was .“His Majesty the
King,” and Clarence had a line which he
dragged out in this wise: “Mah Gahd! Anq
—yew ! —did !—this !” It sticks in my mem-
ory as the worst thing 1 ever heard on the
stage.
“C.K.”: I met the late J. T. Carrodus
(B. 25/6/’25) fairly frequently in the
’eighties. As an orchestral leader he was
supreme, but he rarely accepted solo engage-
ments. To excel in both departments is prac-
tically impossible and rarely is it attempted.
On the only occasion I met Carrodus as a
soloist his single contribution to the pro-
gramme was the hackneyed “Carnival de
Venise” with variations. I asked him the
reason for his curious choice. He said ho
had been playing the thing since he was a
kid and had not the opportunity, even if he
had the inclination, to work up Avorthier
stuff. “Orchestral work takes up all my
time,” he added, “and I prefer it.”
“B.K.D.N.”: There is a play running in
New York which for strange t oaths beats
the productions of Eugene O’Neill hollow
and that’s saying something. The piece,
called “What Price Glory?” is the work of
two new dramatists, both journalists on the
World, and professes to show war exactly
as it is—a sufficiently tall order. In a
horror-stricken description of it George
Tallis said: “The language, blasphemies and
stories were reproduced with a brutal frank-
ness and realism which took my breath away.
Yet this was accepted as the outstanding
success of the New York season. ’ But ot
course it is a success. Since moonshine
took the place of honest liquor m the States
the doped public demands that its spoken
drama shall be as hot and strong as the pic-
tures. “What Price Glory?” seems to fill
the bill.
MOVIELAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sheriff with the silver star,
A knave of craft and guile untold,
Hites deeper on his rank cigar
And starts to hang the hero hold.
Unmoved by tears and proffered pelt.
But sudden rings the rescuing hoof.
Caught in the mesh his hate had planned
His guilt unmasked with damning proof,
Soon, Haman-.like, he swings himself,
Or so it goes in Movieland.
Without a friend, without a scad,
There staggers to the cabin door
A whiskered vagrant on the pad,
And falls exhausted on the floor.
But, warmed with elderberry wine,
He shows a Plan Three weeks he lies;
Then, strong, and fit to beat the band,
Joined by his paid, begins to prise
Huge nuggets from a secret mine,
Or so it goes in Movieland.
Yon Jugo-Slav from Ellis Isle,
You think he is a brainless coot?
Ah. wait! In meteoric style
He soars to be an envied plute.
That maiden in the mountain shack
Who holds the drunken Finn at bay
Is Mary. So we understand
She’ll star upon the Great White Way-
Five reels will show the shining track
By which maids climb in Movieland. ?
And so, with hope and courage buoyed,
I watched the Super-film unfold ;
Though frayed my cuffs and celluloid
My collar, and it’s Wet and cold,
I feast on oysters and champagne
And drive a Rolls, and mingle free
With Doug, and Rudolph, and expand
Till Henry Ford’s a pup to me;
Xor care a doit for cold and rain
The while I dwell in Movieland.

Try Her Way
The way millions now employ to fight
film on teeth
Try the method which is bringing
the prettier teeth you see.
It is the modern method of teeth
cleaning. Millions now employ it.
The results are seen in every circle in
those whiter, cleaner teeth.
It means new beauty, new cleanliness,
new charm. Let this test prove that
to you.
Why teeth decay and
discolour
You feel on teeth a viscous film.
Much of it clings and stays. No
ordinary tooth paste can effectively
combat it.
Food stains, etc., discolour it, so
it forms dingy coats. That is why so
many teeth are clouded.
Film also holds food substance
which ferments and forms acid. Germs
breed by millions in it. They, with
tartar, are the chief cause of pyorrhea.
Science has in late years found effec-
tive film combatants. One disin-
tegrates the film at all stages of forma-
tion. One removes it without harmful
scouring.
A new-type tooth paste has been
created to apply them daily. The name
is Pepsodent.
No one can doubt the results
Send the form for a 10-Day Tube.
Note how clean the teeth feel after
using. Then decide if your home should
adopt this modern method. Cut out
form now.

Ever Built
The Lowest Price for Which
Kvpt Sold
Its overwhelming public acceptance confirms by actual sales supremacy
the outstanding leadership of Essex value. Never was that position so
clear and so rightly deserved as today. This is the finest Essex ever built.
It is the smoothest, most reliable Essex ever built. It is the best looking,
most comfortably riding Essex ever built. And the price, because of vol-
ume, is the lowest at which Essex ever sold.
Built by Hudson
Under Hudson Patents
Essex won its great recognition on the issue
of finest quality, performance and utility
without useless size, weight or cost.
And with its low first cost and operating
economies, you get qualities of long-lasting,
reliable performance, smoothness and
riding ease.
Essex requires little attention to keep in
top condition. Its maintenance cost, we
believe, is the lowest of any car in the
world. You sacrifice no motoring pleasure,
comfort or good looks that large, high-
priced cars can give. Essex is nimble of
action. It is easily handled in traffic, re-
sponsive to every call for power or speed.
And with it you know all the satisfaction
that comes with its distinction as a fine
and beautiful car.
Built by Hudson under the famous Hudson
patents, Essex has behind it the stability of
fifteen years’ manufacturing experience and
the same high standards of service for
which Hudson is noted everywhere.
The COACH
The Hudson-Essex invention, and more than four years’ develop-
ment of the Coach, of course, give it exclusive manufacturing
advantages in this type. No car at or near the price rivals the
Hudson-Essex Coach in actual proof of value—which is SALES.

The Ace: You dawdle too long on the
way. . . .5.0.8.: Doesn't crush more than about 2dwt.
to the con. .. .Biol; But it’s such a stale egg.
Toby: Certainly. There’s always a market for the
Personal par.—things we don’t know about people
we do know. ... J.J.A. : As written, the interest is
too 10ca1... .F.1.C.: Too vague. You may know
all about it, but when a man writes in such general
terms, on any subject, this paper always suspects
that he doesn’t... .R.C.H.: So shallow that only a
wader could make anything of it... .Rippcn’.ea: Yours
appears to be the reckless love of a cave-man from
the heights of Mosman or a sand-bagging gallant
from Toorak:—
’Twas close on about two years ago
Bid you drape thy silken loveliness about mine
neck.
And now? Now you’re a dilapidated wreck;
And twas I did make you so!
I callously threw you into th’ discard with th’ rest,
that night you hung helpless on mine breast
was tli' knot forever untied.
You slid gently down till at mine feet you lied,
Tet not a word did you remark
And now to those exquisite days mine memory
harks,
When at first sight, with you in love I did fall and
look you from out that plausible villian’s hands,
Heeding not his palpable lies
For I judged you with these eyes.
Alas, it must be so; I have paid th’ price
And man must ever assume fresh ties.
....Barbara D.; Blank verse must be much better
than that... .El Pong; The intended humor is wearily
pumped out 5.R.8.: Not well done and on an
impossible theme A.8.W.: Verse far too weak and
lame L.L. (Warwick); Fearful stuff W.H.L.:
More fearful stuff Nell H.: Gently dull Victor
S.; Has a hint of vigor, but most of the lines are
very bad..,.J.M. (Malvern); Miserable little point
badly handled I.W. (Melb,) : The ideas are better
than the verse.... Gilbert G.: Has a sort of very weak
prettiness A.F.S.; Very bad A.M.8.8.; No use
writing all that poor stuff about nothing in par-
ticular Flicker; Not up. .. .H.C.8.: Both miss
D.P.M.; Must go back E.M.E.: The letters fail....
Dento; It misses the thrill of really venomous verse.
... .Catherine: Too thin Bellerive: The melancholy
picture will appeal strongly even to those who have
not been farther out than Manly and St. Kilda:
I’ve been through it, and 1 pity
A swagman in the rain.
Striking out for timbered country.
Across a barren plain.
Dark and drifting clouds above him.
And not a tree in sight
Trudging onward ’neath the pelter
In he’s wretched plight.
With he’s bluey soaked and crumpled
Upon he’s aching back.
And he’s boots a full of water
From the sloppy track.
I’ve been through it, and I pity
A swagman in the rain,
Plodding miles of desolation
Across a barren plain.
....Peregrine; The monkeys are not in our line
D.F.L.; Not for us. There is material there for a
novel, but it does not make a short story... .H.J.L.:
Too long for its interest. A bright, short paragraph
on the same subject would be worth while G.D.
(Hornsby) ; Get directly to your subject and write
on something of general interest. .. .A.A.A.: The
“Day” is only worth a par J.M.S.Y.; Weak imi-
tation of familiar rubbish... .E. 8.; Not up bv some
distance... .W.H.D.: The sonnet misses... .L.M.S.;
Doesn’t strike us S.S. (Innisfail) ; Doesn’t explain
itself sufficiently M.B. (Remuera) : None of them
UP* • • .R.A..5.; Not bad verse, but an old subject
handled in the old way and not interesting 1.W.:
It doesn’t get to anything worth while.. . .W.H.L.:
Suitable for writing in a lady’s album G.S.C.:
Not fresh enough nor well enough handled. .. .H.B.
(Wallerawang); Poor verse that only repeats the
commonplace....McC.R.; Says nothing worth saying
m a very wooden fashion Sucre: Too wild and
sudden Caesar; No possible material there for a
yarn William C.: No use C.L. (Roseville):
None of those endings are real rhymes. Why not
try something in decent form? G.H.C.: Far too
rugged H.K.W.; Wants taming and putting into
shape. \ou cant leave a loose leg trailing in that
way from every stanza F.T. (Manly); Fair verse
that goes over old, old ground and never moves a
pulse... .1.C.W.; Not enough in them... .I.W.'W.:
Doesn’t move us Uncle J.: Poor stuff... .W.J.D. :
Bad verse... .K.H.L.; Misses.... E.D. (Perth): “Ex-
pectancy” must go back Tics Tragique: It’s tragic
all light, particularly the fierce thrusts, as with
a cross-cut clothes-horse, which the alleged rhymes
make at the ear:—
The scene was the sickroom.
The light was dim, and in the gloom
The patient on his bed of pain
Twists and squirms in poetic vein.
Moaning, groaning, twisting, turning,
Oh. this agony of learning !
Strong he was, but now so weak
Since he suffered this poetic streak
Now he’s getting quite delirious.
Surely this is something serious.
Hear him, hear him, curse and cursi
Holy smoke, it’s another verse!
Shall I ring and get the doctor
Or the meat-axe and the chopper?
Now lie’s bleeding: from the nose.
See what comes from writing prose.
Now I hear him softly mutter
“Shy the darn stuff in the gutter.”
Hoping, praying, tears astreaming,
Here I watch the poet dreaming.
With hair on end and breathing fast.
“Thank heaven!” he cries, “at last, at last.
That nearly was the death of me
No more I’ll try to write poetry.”
L.O’N.; Not quite well enough done A.E.Y.:
The verse is fair, but the tale is not well told
D.P.F.O’K. ; Can’t make out whether its “nature’s
peers” or “native’s beers” you want to spend your
remaining years with. Natural beer might certainly
be a stirring discovery P.D. (Raywood): The verse
is rugged and thin D.B. (Coolamon): Nothing
there Edward H.; Too thin U.8.F. : Rubbish.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.R.U.: Drawing not quite up J.E.H.: You
are no cartoonist A. 8 .: Looks like the product
of a lathe.... A.C.; Drawing weak and jest open
to criticism.... D.P. (M.L.) : The shingle is appa-
rently causing trouble in your village; the disturb-
ance is nearly all over here L.O’N.: Thanks- but
too wildly improbable J.G.; Needs more ’than
a pea-shooter to hurt those fellows.

Hypol is a friend indeed to the precious
little folk. It chases away gloom and anxiety,
by restoring sick Children to the bloom of health.
For racking Coughs and Colds, the prevention of
Rickets, or for keeping up the strength of Children
who are growing rapidly, there is nothing so reliable
and sustaining as
Delicate Children should be given Hypol during the wintet
jnonths. It will build up resistance to illness and disease,
and improve their condition generally.

And a profit-maker, moreover.

Phoney”: The crew of the lugger was
preparing the evening meal when a foul odor
floated into the cabin. It would have made
a bonemill smell like a rose-garden. It
proved to be blacham, a paste prepared in
Singapore from small fish and used as a
condiment. Packed in small fibre mats it
does not become deadly, odoriferously speak-
. Ull til heated. Mixed with crushed
chillies,, it helps to make curried fish, the
mam diet of the crews, a delightful dish.
But smell—ye gods !

“Yarrum”; The cheapest coal ever I
/ x- 1 §'ht was at Swansea, on Lake Macquarie
(jN.S.W ) The ketch Galgabba—belonging
to Boyd Bros.—with 70 tons of coal for
Kiama, got a bumping on the bar and sprang
a leak. The coal was unloaded opposite the
school, and 30 tons sold to me for £2 I
had 40 boys, with barrows and bags, shifting
it into the playground, and it took them a
week. But it kept us warm for years.

“Slam” : Why the long delay in exploiting
our various native barks, palms and grasses '!
Bungalook basketry, made first by a woman,
Mrs. Frank W alker, is the only serious attempt
so far to use the abundant Tesources at hand
in the way of native barks. The messmate-
gum bark gives a splendid pulp for uphol-
sterers ; the large fans of the cabbage-palm
make durable baskets, hats, etc.; the native
flax lily was used by the abos. for making
the toughest lines and cords; the bark of
the native nettle (Laportea gigas ) affords a
strong fibre, suitable for nets and lines; the
tough-bark” or pimelea yields a very strong
fibre; the leaves of the screw-pine are capable
of being turned into serviceable bags and
mats. Among the native plants eminently
suitable for the manufacture of paper are
the paper-grass (Poa australis), native
sheathed rush, marsh rush, and sword rush
{hep. gladiatum ). Yet we continue to import!
* * * *
“W ai-hoi” : There’s more pearl-shell to be
seen in Darwin (N.T.) these days than for
a long time past. I have just seen seven
tons of it taken by three boats during the
past month. It’s fine stuff, too. For years
past Darwin shell has beaten the Broome
and, Thursday Island product by an average
of ±l5 per ton. Experts do not agree as to
the exact reason why N.T. shell should have
more body and lustre than the goods from
other grounds, but some pearling bosses attri-
bute it to the tremendous body of fresh water
that flows into the ocean from the Northern
rivers—either that or the better sea-bottom
feed.
* * * *
. ‘‘Sturt”: Renmark, S.A.’s first and chief
irrigation settlement on the Murray, is about
to scrap the pumping-engines which gave it
its start. They were built in England to the
order of George Chaffey, now retired to Cali-
forma; Ben Chaffey of Melbourne is his son.
\\ .L., the other pioneer, lives at Mildura,
the sister irrigation colony that the brothers
founded in Vic. George Chaffey has always
claimed that the great Tangye firm of Bir-
mmgham, though making the engine, to an
original design of his own, queried its effec-
tiveness for its purpose, and refused to
guarantee the result; but he persisted, and
the, great pumps have always done their work
well. Still, 40 years is a long time in the life
ot any engine, and the Trust is now going to
instal something more modern.
. * * * *
Polycarp”: All the good-humored chaff at
the expense of the G.P.O. doesn’t detract
from its tenacity in sticking to a trail. A
Brisbane man had a letter posted to him in
I ebruary, 1924, from a few streets away. He
left for England via Maoriland on the day it
was posted, and the letter pursued him. It
followed him across the Dominion and all
over the U.K., and was finally delivered the
other day at the original address in a Bris-
bane suburb, having arrived only one mail
behind its quarry. The tattered envelope,
after going round the world and being
handled by scores of officials for lid., is one
crossword puzzle of office stamps and differ-
ent addresses in varidus inks. The journey
took over a year.
(( * * * *
“C. Coral”: The cycle trade has had a
lively time in Thursday Island, the chief
customers being young Japanese seamen from
the diving-boats, who spend odd days ashore
m cruising violently up and down the street
on their new possessions. This new form
of exercise has nothing to do with physical
fitness for diving purposes; it is simply that
llie wily sons of Nippon have discovered
that used cycles get into Japan duty-free.
Hence the, “breaking-in” process before the
goods accompany home-going travellers as
personal luggage.
* . * * *
“Lomara”: Pessimists who saw a white
elephant in the Vic. Government’s electricity
scheme and town at Yallourn have been con-
founded as far as the briquettes enterprise
is concerned. The half-factory which turns
out 360 tons a day cannot cope with the
demand. The little bricks of compressed
lignite are about the size and shape of a
handleless flatiron; they are clean to’ finger,
require no splitting, light well, last mod-
erately long, burn without waste, and are
cheaper than poor wood and relatively no
dearer than the best. But it is doubtful if
they pay, except as a user-up of a waste pro-
duct. The factory they need is a huge one.
. e a . y observer goes away convinced
that it requires a very great deal of complicated
plant to bring forth a very small and simple-
looking brick. The moisture-laden brown-
coal has to be graded to size, cooked in vast
cylinders, ground in vast pulverisers,
pressed m vast presses and handled an inor-
dinate number of times. If the works are now
only half a factory, the whole when com-
pleted will look like another Exhibition
Building dropped in the Gippsland bush.


Australian-made Farm Implements are
Better. They are also much Cheaper.

CREAM
“Gippsland”: Reference to queer Chris-
tian names (B. 4/6/’25) calls to my memory
one bestowed on a Queenscliff (Vic.) young-
ster who should now be 16. He arrived just
"hen Halley’s comet w T as becoming per-
ceptible in the heavens, and his parents
solemnly commemorated the fact by having
him christened Cometeer.
Bob Solly, M.L.A. for Carlton (Vic.), lias
again been made chairman of Exhibition
trustees. He is strongly in favor of such
arena and building improvements as will
make the gazabo and its environs a better
revenue-producing proposition than it is.
Elected first to the Assembly as a railway
employees’ member under the Irvine sepa-
rate representation scheme, Solly captured
Carlton 21 years ago and has held it since.
“Cwrw Bach”: I won’t enter him for the
Oldest Soldier stakes, although he must have
knocked off having birthdays for many years
before he enlisted; but Alec Marshall, for
a time R.S.M. of the 15th Battalion at
Anzac, fought at Tel-el-Ivebir under Wolseley.
He was wounded at Quinn’s on Gallipoli, and
returned to Australia. In 1917 I came across
him again on the Medic, going over to do a
bit more as a munition-worker.
The famous Westward Ho (Devon) Col-
lege, which produced Rudyard Kipling, along
with Stalky and McTnrk, gave two out-
standing men to the M.L. police force. One
was ex-Superintendent Marsack and the
other Constable T. H. H. Beddek, lately re-
tired. Beddek was the son of a colonel in
the Madras Staff Corps, and after a taste
for adventure had led him to sea he joined
up with the M.L. police force. Another ex-
pupil is General Godley, also known in M.L.
.T. .7. Richardson, the new president of the
N.SAV. branch of the British Astronomical
Society in succession to Father Bigot, will
bring to the office an excellent record
acquired in technical circles. As head of
the electrical designing work in the Depart-
ment of Public Works, he has managed some
big undertakings. Determination of stand-
ards, particularly in electrical engineering,
astronomy and five joint-secretaryship of
the physical section of the Royal Society are
some of the objects of his leisure moments.
A good Australian, he did useful war service.
William Mclver, Vic. Director of Land
Settlement at £1750 a year, who helped his
staff the other day to celebrate his poor
little C.M.G.-ship, was never a 9-to-5 offi-
cial. In his spare time he won accountancy
and audit qualifications, and mastered all
the land laws extant. But his qualifications
would have been useless without the per-
sonality and self-confidence behind them.
He has been the chief adviser in spend-
ing £25,000,000 or thereabouts on closer
settlement for ex-soldiers and civilians, and
his courage is commensurate with his opti-
mism.
Two noted pioneers on the N.S.W. North
Coast to-day are Mr. and Mrs. Alexander
McDonell, of Cundletown. They both came
to Australia in 1836 by the ship William
Nicoll, which sailed direct from the High-
lands of Scotland, when the McDonells of
Glengarry, a clan that was broken up about
that time, began to immigrate almost en masse
to Australia and M.L. Mrs. McDonell once
rode on horseback 120 miles to the nearest
R.C. clergyman, and carried her first-born
child—an infant two months old—to have it
baptised. Of 13 children two sons are priests
and four daughters are nuns.
“Toorale”: It is hardly correct to say that
a hydatid cyst was removed from a woman’s
heart in a Sydney hospital (B. 11/6/’25).
The cyst was in the diaphragm, but its pres-
sure was exerted upward on to the back of
the heart. In the operation the lung was
allowed to collapse and a section of the chest
including ribs, flesh and muscles, was laid
back, exposing lung and heart; this enabled
the surgeon to feel right round the back of
the heart. Tubes were inserted to drain the
cyst and the section of chest replaced and
stitched. The dangerous and delicate opera-
tion proves once more that skilful feats of
surgery can be performed as successfully in
Australian hospitals as elsewhere.
“Buttenderry”: The story is still told in
a far western (N.S.W.) town. A somewhat
weedy agent, meeting McFullmouth. a 14-t.
squatter, at the pub, offered to wager £lO
that he would carry the big man in the heavy
oak hall-chair to the post office and back,
a distance of about 100 yards. Having felt
the agent’s biceps, McFullmouth took the
bet, and it was arranged that the contest
should come off at 10 next morning. Sharp
on time the squatter arrived, and, in the
interested presence of a small crowd, which
included several women, took his seat and
invited the other to go ahead. “Righto.”
said 5 per cent.; “take ’em off.” “Take
what off?” “Your clothes,” was the calm
reply. “I’m betting I can carry you." The
agent collected.
Almost coincident with the eightieth birth-
day of Captain Bennett, who was her'skipper
when the Loch Vennacher beat the Cutty
Sark to London Fool, comes Captain R. J.
Woodgett, son of the captain of the beaten
sea-hound. Captain Woodgett is in command
of the steamer Anclxises, but he is proud of
his father’s connection with the old-time
clipper. The Cutty Sark, now the property
of a Captain Dowson, is being invested with
some of her old glory in order that she may
be taken round the world for exhibition pur-
poses ; and the trip may bring her again to
(Australia. The present skipper of the
Anchises saw the old craft in Cape Town
during the war, dirty and unkempt, but
making profits for Portuguese owners. But
she has since been rescued from that service.
“The Deacon”; The best driver of the
century in Bananaland is or was Arthur
Single, scion of an old N. S. Wales family.
Tiring of the big stock route on which he
spent the greater part of the year bringing
fats from the Gulf to Maitland, he opened
up a butchery on the then booming Sapphire
fields (C.Q.). As his route daily covered
anything from 30 to 50 miles, four fresh
horses were requisitioned from the droving
outfit each day. The first four cut out went
in, regardless of size, quality or equipment,
and the noise of the old shandrydan, the
rattle of the trace chains and the yelling
and whip-cracking could be heard miles off.
Then the bottom blew out of the industry,
and Single went back to droving. No better
man ever steadied the lead —and this despite
the fact that his right thumb was missing.

The Burroughs Duplex Adding Machine
is really two adding machines in one —two
machines operated from a single keyboard.
For instance, the Duplex will add groups
of figures and give a total (besides a sub-total)
of each group. Then, without re-listing a
single group total, it gives a grand total of all
groups automatically. Such totals are neces-
sary when dissecting expenses, or sales by
departments, assistants, or lines.
Or, the Burroughs Duplex will add two
columns of figures at the same time and give
separate totals for both columns which it will
combine into a grand total if desired. In listing
cost and selling price, Dr. and Cr. Postings, etc.,
you will find this feature alone will save a
great many minutes.
For a demonstration of the Burroughs
Duplex, just mail the coupon. You will not
be obligating yourself in any way.
The Burroughs Adding Machine Company manufactures the only com-
plete line of Adding, Bookkeeping, Calculating and Duplex Machines.
Factories at Nottingham, England; Windsor, Canada; Detroit, U. S. A.

The Brass Door-Knocker.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A SIXTEENTH-CENTURY gentleman,
who holds
A book within his hand, or else some
screed
That dates a heritage and proves a case—
A likely thing to balance to a need —
With no disclosures in his sombre face.
This is the knocker! How the grey ghosts
I )ass . , ~,
A knick-a-knocking on the time-worn brass t
Perhaps a burly rogue, with murder pent
In his cold heart, came stealthily by nignt
And touched this warning with a treacherous
hand, .
Fearing the smoking torches’ ruddy light,
Though venture —and escape—were ably
planned.
Hut Chance may make the craftiest play the
fool;
The brain behind him might not spare the
tool
One notes the seeking ray the lamp has cast
On to the shallow steps, hears clashing
chains,
A handle turning ; then, to guard the street,
Only a closed door with its clamps re-
mains. . ,
The watch belike is slumbering on Ins beat.
Did the lean prowling cat that padded by
Bristle a moment at a muffled cry:
Now down the steps the hooded slayer creeps.
Looks round just once, his shoulders
hunched, as though
He felt the burden on his blackened soul.
Past Wapping Stairs the oily tides will
flow; , ,
The boat must find him ready at the goal:
There is a bag of gold, and (happier chance .)
Some red-cheeked Moll to share the \oyag(
to France!
T-Ie does not brush the knocker as lie goes;
Till dawn, undimmcd its glimmer shall re-
main. ,
The sixteenth-century gentleman can smite i
Untroubled dreaming, though a crimson
stain . , ,
Crows on the costly carpets, from that patch
Between the linens of a great man s breast.
To-morrow shall the knocker know no rest.
Perchance on some rose-scented summer s
night _ . ,
An ivory hand has slipped a silken cloak,
Dreading the tat-a-tat her trembling makes.
Sure that her furtive knock the world
aw r oke, . .
Till from curled head to satin shoe she
quakes,
And almost turns to flee the way she came,
Rosy with blushes from her happy shame.
M'Lord will trust no menial to the door;
Sleek-footed he will come himself, to set
The panel wide, yet let no lamplight through.
More wide his arms, to teach her to forget.
To plant a laughter in her bright eyes blue,
Press his hot lips where her white throat is
bare
And carry her, triumphant, up the stair.
The sixteenth-century gentleman may muse
A little on the ways of lovers then,
A tolerant smile upon his bearded lip
M’Lord the Duke is just as other men!
Screwed to the door a brass man, too, may
slip.
Perhaps the light wind moved him to a tune
Upon the panel; or this night of June
Found Eros lingering in the quiet street,
Till unseen fingers touched the oblong
brass,
Playing the. measure of a merry song.
Let not wiseacres scold! All love must
pass.
Let Youth enjoy—the roses last not long.
The old door-knocker taps to every mood
Till two brass handles lift a chest of
wood!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
A Triangle of the Never-Never.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was when the Murmmbidgee irriga-
tion areas were* in their infancy that
Bill Cantor, Old Alec and myself had
each taken up a ten-acre farm, side by side.
Stockmen, shearers and out-back bushmen
all of us, as intense-culture farmers we were
square pegs in round holes if ever men were.
Old Alec had his boy with him, a bare-faced,
clean-limbed youth of about twenty; acti\o
as a cat, and soft-voiced as a Maori. V\ e
had half a dozen light saddle-hacks amongst
us, and with these yoked up together and
attached to a small single-furrow plough we
tried to carry on. It took us three weeks
to plough five acres. When the horses
pulled together the plough fairly flew along,
the earth spurting out from the mouldboard
like spray from the nose of a racing motor-
launch. But it was generally a plunge for-
ward and a jerk back, see-saw fashion,
with a tossing of heads and a stamp-
ing of feet, and often it finished up by a
couple of them getting tangled in the gear
and then kicking themselves clear of every-
thing. So we gave the ploughing idea up—
we would broadcast lucerne-seed and scratch
it in with a harrow while the ground was
soft.
One afternoon, just after we had decided
on this, the three of us were yarning of old
times —the boy was away digging for worms
for fishing-bait—when Old Alec remarked
casually:
“Yon blokes have often asked me how I
came to lose the first finger of my right hand.
Til tell you now, as the boy is out of the
way—l didn’t want to tell the yarn while
he was about. Though there isn’t much in
it, after all.
“It was late in the ’eighties that I set
out from Gamooweal into the heart of the
Queensland bush. I was young at the time,
and craved for adventure, and Heaven knows
I found it on that trip! I intended to take
on anything that might turn up brumby-
running, kangaroo-shooting, prospecting -
anything that the Never-Never offered. One
day, after I had been about three weeks out,
1 suddenly came on to a rather decent sort
of a camp beside a thick clump of lapunyah,
in the centre of which was a waterhole. 1
noticed a horse, witli a pack-load of kangaroo-
skins, tied to a tree, and a couple of well-
bred looking greyhounds were chained up
close by. The camp was clean as anew
pin, and by the knick-knacks I saw about
I knew that a woman was living there. Be-
fore dismounting I gave the usual ‘Anybody
home?’ but as 1 got no reply, after waiting
a quarter of an hour I decided to fill the
water-bags and push on. I supposed that it
was the camp of a married kangaroo-shooter,
and that his wife had gone out with him
for the day. There was a big bough shed
that had been used as a dining-room, the
table a flattened sheet of bark, smooth side
up, resting on two cross-sticks, whose ends
fitted into four stakes that had been driven
into the ground. On either side was a round
rail, also resting in forked-sticks, which served
the purpose of stools or chairs. On the tame
was a pile of clean crockery and tinware,
and parts of a damper and brownie, camp-
oven cooked. These were covered loosely by
a clean bag, and I felt tempted to sample
the food, but instead I wrote a note in pencil
stating who I was and where I was going.
This I placed beneath a plate. I also left
a couple of books, placing part of a broken
boot-last on top as a weight. I remember
the books quite well. One was ‘A Tale of
Two Cities,’ the other a tattered copy of
‘The Woman in White.’
“After listening for a while and then mak-
ing a final survey of the camp I started
off; and, although I saw fresh tracks of
waggonette-wheels and others of horses going
south towards the ranges, I did not follow
them, but decided to keep my horses’ heads
towards the north-west.
“I thought little about the camp during
the next three or four weeks, for my mind
was full of a good-looking show that I had
discovered, and I was determined to come
back and prospect it as soon as there was rain.
It was then that I fell in with a big mob
of cattle going right up to the mouth of the
gulf, and as a job was offered I joined them.
It was on this trip that I mated up with
Ilyall—you’ve both heard me speak of him ;
a restless sort of chap: died afterwards at
Blank Range, in W.A. We were about four
months with the cattle, and I persuaded
Ryall to come back with me to help dis-
cover what I thought would prove a bonanza.
“We found the spot all right, and there
was water and grass in plenty, the spinifex
on the ridges waving like a crop of ripening
oats, and the waterliolos and gilgais teem-
ing with ducks and other kinds of water-
fowl. Wo traced outcrops of likely-looking
reef for miles, and here and there where
they dipped out of sight we cut trenches,
often a chain long, and five or six feet deep,
till we found the reef again. We must have
pottered about like this for eight or nine
months. Whether it was that we'd had too
little experience at the game, or whether
the show was barren. I don’t know ; but wt
won nothing, and after a week’s work get-
ting our horses together we decided to make
back into civilisation again.
“The shortest route lay by the camp that
I had passed, so wo started off in that direc-
tion. The day before we should have reached
there —we were twenty-odd miles from the
camp—we were crossing a little open plain
when we came on three horses feeding; but
what surprised us most was that two of
them had collars on their necks, and the
other had a battered saddle; and although,
owing to the animal improving in condition,
the green-hide girth and surcingle were
buried deep in the flesh, they had not broken.
“The horses were easily caught; but not
having any use for them, we removed the
old gear and let them go again. Of course we
wondered what and who and where the owner
might be; still the matter did not give us
much concern, for in those days the Never-
Never was a place where queer things often
happened. But next day, when we arrived
at the old camp. I felt that there was or
had been something seriously wrong; for
where the two dogs had been tied were their
two skeletons, still attached to the chains.
The horse, too, was dead, with the skins
still tied to the pack, and the rein still fast-
ened to the tree. My note, discolored and
musty, was under the plate as I had left it.
and there were the two books beneath the
boot-last. I noticed now that there were two
sleeping-tents. One had a single bunk, while
the other had a rough double bed, with the
bedding still there. As the season had been
rainy, great pumpkin-vines sprawled over
the ground in a semi-circle where the camp-
litter had been swept, and the bough-shed
was overgrown with rank herbage and toad-
stools. Everything otherwise was as I had
left it a year before. After talking the
matter over, we chose a camping-place some
distance off, and determined to wait a day
or so and investigate.
“Next day we rode out in the direction,
as well as I could remember, that the wheel-
tracks I had seen on my last visit were tak-
ing. We kept together, and after riding for
some hours, and finding nothing, we were
beginning to think that we were on a wild-
goose chase, when suddenly our horses, which
were strangers to that class of country,
floundered belly-deep in a small mud-spring.
We realised then that we would need to keep
a sharp eye lest we might become submerged,
holus bolus, in a bigger and more treacher-
ous spring. This necessary caution narrowed
our perspective somewhat. Glancing up a
little further on, we saw, not fifty yards
ahead of us, what appeared to be a dilapi-
dated tilted waggonette. Closer inspection
showed that it was standing high and dry
on a peninsula of firm ground, with a seeth-
ing sea of grey mud ahead and on either side.
After tying our horses we crept warily up
and were amazed at what we saw. Attached
to a swingle bar at the end of the pole,
amongst the mudcaked harness, were the
bones of a horse which had apparently been
the leader of a team of three, and had been
caught and sucked down in the quagmire, to
be later shoved up to the surface again. No
doubt they were the two wheelers wo had
found with the collars on the day before, as

“Every Picture
Tells a S tory”
What
causes
Aching Joints?
Much of the pain attributed to rheumatism is
really due to an excess of uric acid in the blood
caused by weak kidneys.
When excess uric acid col-
lects in the blood it forms
jagged crystals, which are de-
posited in the muscles, joints,
aiong the walls of the arteries,
and in the sheaths of nerves.
The movement of a nerve or
muscle that contains these uric-
acid crystals causes sharp, in-
tense, darting pains, and in time
starts swelling and inflammation
of the joints.
The moment you feel any
rheumatic pains—any twinges
or uneasiness in the , back—any
sign of urinary irregularity, be-
gin with Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills. This medicine aids
the kidneys to filter excess uric
acid out of the blood, and has
been winning successes for over
fifty years.
SERIOUS KIDNEY TROUBLE
CURED.
Mrs. F. Schroder, Oberon Cottage, 14
Oberon Street, Randwiek, Sydney, says:
For a good while a member of my
family suffered from rheumatism and
backache. The pain was often so severe
that it was torture to move about,
especially stooping. We felt sure the
kidneys were not working properly, as
there were several other marked symp-
toms noticeable, but backache and rheu-
matism were by far the most painful.
One day Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
were recommended to us, so I sent for
some, and I am pleased to tell you
they acted splendidly, three bottles
making a complete cure. Some years
have elapsed since then, but there has
been no return of the trouble, so we
feel safe in saying the cure is a perma-
nent one.”
years later, Mrs. Schroder savs:
’The cure referred to still holds good,
a fact that speaks volumes for Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. They are a
splendid kidney medicine and will
always have our hearty recommenda-
tion.

TWO RESIDENTS OF SYDNEY CURED OF
PILES BY DOAN’S OINTMENT.
A KENSINGTON CASE.
Mr. Joseph Abrahams, senior, No. 29
Anzac Parade, Kensington, Sydney,
says: “For years I was tortured with
itching piles. The irritation of this ail-
ment is terrible, and only those who
have suffered know how awful it is. I
used dozens of pile remedies, but could
not get anything to give me ease. A
friend urged me to try Doan’s Oint-
ment, saying he was sure this prepara-
tion would cure me. I got some and
commenced using it, and in a very short
time I was completely cured.”
Nine years later Mr. Abrahams says:
“I have not been troubled with Piles
since Doan’s Ointment cured me over
nine years ago, I have advised many
sufferers to use this grand remedy, and
I am sure it will cure in every case if
people will only apply it properly.”
AN UNDERCLIFFE CASE.
Mr. F. W. Martin, Homer Street,
Undereliffe, Sydney, says: “For about
12 months I was tortured with Itching
Piles, iad the pain and irx-itation nearly
drove me mad. I consulted a doctor,
and used Pile remedies, but could not
get permanent relief. I heard that
Doan’s Ointment was good, and decided
to try it. After a few applications I
felt better, and by the time the third
pot was finished I was perfectly cured.
I advise all those who suffer with Piles
to use Doan’s Ointment, as I am sure
they will benefit by it.”
Eleven years later Mr. Martin says:
“Eleven years ago I told you Doan’s
Ointment had cured me of Piles. I
can now add that my cure has lasted,
for I am still free of this torturing
ailment. I always keep Doan’s Oint-
ment in the house, and use it occasion-
ally, just as a preventive against any
return.”

where they would have pulled up the ground
was firm, and we surmised that they had
kicked themselves free of the tackling. That
part seemed to w r ork out all right, but for a
time w r e were baffled by what we saw a few
yards away. The mud seemed to expand in
ripples from the centre to its outer edge,
and from that point the ground was soft and
springy ; and it was there that we came to
the clothed remains of two men, mud-caked
and awful looking. They were locked in each
other's arms, and the fingers of one’s hands
were entwined in the stiffened sinews of the
other’s throat. The surroundings were so
gruesome that, as the sun was now well
down amongst the treetops, we did not stop
to form a theory, but moved round to the
waggonette again.
“Here the greatest surprise of all was
waiting for its. The trap was still inhabited!
That is to say, the floor w r as spread with
filthy rags and tattered greasy blankets, and
the ground about showed the prints of bare
feet in the loose dust by the tailboard. Here
was a riddle that would take some, working
out; so, notwithstanding the uncanniness of
the whole thing, we agreed to wait and watch.
“We did not wait long; out of a dense
belt of umbrella mulga that capped an adja-
cent ridge came a human being such as I
had never seen before and God grant I’ll
never see again. Shuffling along and almost
naked, stumbling in weakness, it was a white
woman, her hair tousled and matted, the lips
drawn right back, leaving the teeth long
and white like those of a snarling dog; and
with its skinny arms and legs dangling, she
carried a child that in appearance resembled
flic carcase of a freshly-skinned half-starved
joey kangaroo. She was at the waggonette
before she saw us coming towards her; then
with a squealing cry she clutched the child to
her and tried to reach the scrub again. But
she floundered in her weakness and fell be-
fore she had gone half a chain, and I was
beside her in a second, grasping her by the
shoulder. Although she was exhausted and
spent, those long white teeth, from which
the lips were drawn back, were sharp and
the jaws strong; and as they closed on
the first finger of my right hand, flesh and
skin and sinew severed, and bone crunched.
But I stuck to her and the child till Ryall
came up, and between us we managed to get
the two of them (the child was a little girl)
back to our cam)?.
I he woman was as mad as a hatter and
so ravenously hungry that she clawed the
food we gave her like a wild cat; and as
she would try to bolt for the bush <it every
opportunity we chained the poor creature
to the trunk of a small tree. It meant wait-
ing two or three days to break a couple of
our horses to harness, so that we could take
her on with us, and it was while we were so
engaged that half a dozen wandering blacks
came to us. One of them, a potbellied
veteran, who at some time of his life had
been a station boy, spoke understandable
English. He knew that feller, he said, point-
inging to the woman. ‘Old man’s mate been
clear out with him : old man been follow up
track on horseback. Chasem into mud-spring,
t wo feller fight, go down in mud. By-an’-bye
horse come up again. That feller’—the
woman—‘him go mad. Old gin die last
week she bin feedem; poor feller starve
now. Child he come last year. Him mad
too —better you knock him on head, mine
tink.’
“We managed to patch the old trap up,
and after we had buried the two men—as
they had died, together—we started off; but
the woman got weaker and weaker, and on
the third day on the road she collapsed and
died. I think the sudden change from star-
vation to plenty was too much for her, and
really killed her with kindness.
TV e pushed on, taking the child with us,
and when we reached the first township we
told the police there all we knew of the
matter. After making copious notes the
official told us we could go on, and if he
wanted us he would send after us. But we
did not move on for many a long day, for
slight blood-poisoning had set in where the
woman had bitten my finger, and it became
so bad that the doctor there had to take it
( ’ff the socket, as you see it now. And
that,” said Alec, “is how 1 came to lose the
first finger from my right hand.”
“Yes,” I said, “but you did not tell us
what became of the mad woman’s little girl!”
“Oh.” he answered, “someone adopted her
and of course she’s grow r u up now.”
And as Old Alec looked up and saw the
boy swinging down the path he grinned
quaintly; and as I looked, too, I noticed
for the first time how sweeping were the
curves of the boy’s hips beneath his dun-
garees, and how small and shapely his hands
and feet for a man of his age, and the soft-
ness of his voice as he hailed us. I won-
dered if Bill Cantor had noticed these things
also.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TO get correct results from any problem
it is well to neglect none of the
factors, however small; and if you
live in Fiji it is well to remember also that
trifles with us are often essentials with the
native. Corliss has learned this lesson, and
maybe other lessons to the good of his soul
and, perhaps, to the detriment of his bank
account.
Corliss was a planter and trader in one
of the outer islands of the Group, dis-
tinguished above the vulgar herd in that a
lot of his culture went into his business.
.now, modern business—but you know what
business is as well as I do, so let’s get
on with the story.
Corliss bought copra from the natives, who,
even before the advent of the first mis-
sionary, understood the principles of busi-
ness more than you would think. Corliss
made money out of them, notwithstanding,
because, although they knew most about
adulteration and false-weighing of produce,
hr knew most about the mechanism of scales
and steelyards. Most of us thought so
much of him that we avoided him (in busi
ness) as the amateur boxer avoids the pro-
fessional. But poor old Gilbert was differ-
ent : they lived on different islands and saw
each other but seldom. Hence it was that
when Corliss sailed into Gilbert’s anchor-
age one evening and explained that he had
chartered the cutter through to Levuka,
and that, aware of Gilbert’s waiting copra,
he had come to help him move it since his
own freight did not fill the boat. Gilbert
thanKed him quite innocently and said he
would be glad to have a few tons lifted. He
invited Corliss in for the night and pro-
duced the bottle of hospitality as island
custom demands, just as it there was nothing
strange in Corliss’s going out of his way to
help anyone but himself.
in the morning Corliss was in a tearing
hurry, which same is not island custom;
and this Gilbert told me afterwards he cer-
tainly thought strange, but not sinister.
Corliss blamed it all on the tide, glibly
explaining that he must go back home while
the boat went on to Levuka and—look here,
bed tell Gilbert what: since the waiting
copra was not yet bagged like that already
in the hold, why not ship it in bulk! You
counin t contuse the loads, and not only
would time thus be saved, but also the trouble
of sewing and branding sacks. One who
understands our simple philosophy will not
blame Gilbert too much that he fell to the
last argument. He put his freight aboard in
mass, and when Corliss and the cutter had
sailed out of his life beyond the horizon, he
took 11 ]i Iris problem of existing with the
Jeasr amount of trouble while awaiting what
le Bon I >ieu should cause to happen next.
It is necessary to explain here that island
atmosphere has many strange effects upon
men and things. 11 you sell a known weight
ot copra at a quoted price per ton, the
calculation of your cheque would seem a
simple affair. Should you try a shipment,
your naive ideas would suffer a sudden re-
adjustment. Maybe gravitation, like the
clocks, varies at different spots on the earth’s
crust, being least of all in Levuka, as experi-
ence _ seems to prove, but—well, until that
evening 1 had never heard of any planter
getting more for his produce than it was
worth.
Gilbert showed me his cheque as soon as
lie had recovered from the daze into which
the sight had thrown him. It was £7O or
so in excess of even the most optimistic hopes
ot the most inexperienced planter, and I
asked for details. Then I heard all about
Corliss; and that made it stranger still, for
1 knew Corliss. So we discussed the pheno-
menon, which seemed almost like a reversal
0 1 a nMural law, till on an inspiration we
called m the cutter captain ; and there entered
.loseva, who tucked in his sulu and squatted
on the floor and spake in this wise.
Sombo! This is indeed a strange thing
the turanga tells. But now that I recollect,
if may be that those bushmen who are mv
crew have done this thing. There is that
which I would tell. That fori papalangi who
chartered my cutter last trip is of a bad
mind Will the turangas perhaps speak to
him that lie pay me that sixpence? What,
sixpence. The sixpence he owes my son
who is named Vatu. No indeed, ni'v son
is not here. He, is dead —10. 20 years ago
how can I tell? But he was working for
Misi Ivorlisi, and when the time (Of
indenture) was finished Misi Ivorlisi
most surely kept back a sixpence and
spoke thus to my son with many bad
words, ‘The sixpence is to pay for the
matches you stole.’ And that was not the
speech of a good man. because my son Vatu
is not a thief. (Certainly he is dead—were
there not ten pigs eaten at the feast of a lnm-
dred days?) He was not an educated man
at all, lie was an honest man; and we know
that it was Kamenieli who stole those
matches. No, he is not dead, lie....but
what does the turanga say? What have the
matches to do with the copra? Now. I will
speak a true word and tell the turangas that
that ,&«•* papalangi Misi Ivorlisi is of a bad
mind .... And so on, and so on, according
to guileless Fijian ways the talk surged back
and forth over the body of those matches till
Jos'cva was shepherded back to the main path
and continued: “And so I, knowing him to
be of a bad mind, who always uses forbidden
words when I ask for that sixpence, did
watch him as we sailed from here, and he
went into the hold and began to fill this
turanga s copra into bags which he had hid-
den ready for the purpose. And all the time
we were returning to his place to set him
down he was filling those sacks. That was
a had thing to do. So when we had set down
Misa Ivorlisi at his place and had sailed on
to Levuka, I sent the crew below to empty
out again those sacks which Misi Ivorlisi had
filled. No, indeed, why should 1 count them?
Lilt the crew arc fools; what do they know'!
It may be that they emptied out too many
sacks and restored to this turanga 7 s copra
some that was indeed Misi Ivorlisi’s. But
that fori papalangi is a bad man who speaks
kotam against me when I ask for that six-
pence—is it not my son’s? And all the
tobacco on board is finished, and when I go
hack those ill-mannered men of the woods
that are my crew wall ask if the tiirangas
here gave me any—thanks, thanks, indeed,
sirs. And now r I go to see if there yet remain
in the galley so much as one little ember to
light the tobacco with— vinaka, vinafot, saka”
and Captain Joseva gathered up his tobacco
and matches where they had fallen at his
feet and went out.
Gilbert looked at me and said; “Well, I’m
blest! It seems the extra 70 quid comes from
Corliss’s lot, and he is naturally short the
same amount? What do you think?”
T think,” I said, “that Corliss would have
found it cheaper to have refunded that six-
pence with compound interest to date when
last called upon.”
“No, but what do you think I ought to
do ?
I'm not doing anyone else’s thinking, Gil-
bert, I said; “but I bet a dollar that if Cor-
liss has had his mail he has struck his
weirdest problem yet.”
Gilbert is a friend of mine, and I would
like you to think well of him; and it is thus
distressing to have to record that the simple-
ton paid that money back to the Levuka
buyer, though the certainty that it never
went farther is a sort of thin comfort.
