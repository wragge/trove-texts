CT NINIAN’S CAVE near Whithorn, on the rocky coast of
Wigtownshire, in western Scotland, is reputed to have served
as an oratory for St. Ninian, who was bom on the shores of the
Solway in the fourth century. According to tradition he was a
Briton, taught at Rome, and, on his return, he converted the
Southern Piets and built the first stone church This
church was erected on the site later occupied by Whithorn Priory,
and was dedicated to St. Martin of Tours, who had sent masons
to shape the walls after the Roman fashion. Here, as first bishop
of the Southern Piets St. Ntmantdted_m4: 12 andte

CHRISTMAS FLOOD.
Christmas is a terrible season for re-
viewers. It begins about August, when
the earliest birds go hunting for worms
to read their books about witches and
fairies ; by November it is monstrous —
there are gnomes, pirates and animated
animals in every corner of the room, elves
are under the desk, bunyips are breeding
in the wastepaper-basket.
It is a season when the most hard-
boiled authors go soft in the head and
woo little children with soft words and
winning smiles. Wasn’t it last Christmas
that Lawson Glassop, after writing
a novel about soldiers so obviously true
that the authorities felt irresistibly im-
pelled to ban it, turned round and wrote
about a Wild Garage that wasn’t true at
all and so was given to young people to
improve their minds?
This season it is lon Idriess who
(not for the first time) has suffered an
attack of Christmas sentiment, and, instead
of writing for hard, horny-handed men
who fossick for opals or perish from
thirst in the desert, has addressed him-
self to the assembled small boys of
the nation. Admittedly The Opium
Smugglers (Angus and Robertson) is
billed as a true story, and, writing about
trochus-fishing and its attendant devilish
machinations, Idriess hasn’t yet got to
the stage of seeing pixies under the
lantana; but still, he will have to be
watched.
Then there is Mr. Hal Missingham, who,
instead of buying formidable paintings
of soil-erosion for the N. S. Wales
National Gallery, has turned out An
Animal Anthology, nicely produced by
the Shepherd Press and illustrated with
pen-drawings and photographs. An
Animal Anthology is not specifically in-
tended for children, and some of the
quotations from Burns, Walt Whitman
and D. H. Lawrence may be a little
advanced ; but on the whole it would
do very well for animal-lovers of all
ages. The photographs, of everything
from a wombat to a giraffe, are the best
of it, the pen-drawings being rather
wooden. The text is made up of quota-
tions from all sorts of authors —comic
verses by Leon Gellert rubbing shoulders
with the immortal Mrs. Beaton, Rupert
Brooke giving his impressions of the dog
and Huxley of the gorilla, Barron Field
on the kangaroo and Jeremiah on the
ass.
These are two books that insist on
notice; but the pile of Christmas wares
is three feet high. No man could read
them all; and anyone who attempted to
do so would be found one day in a
corner, quietly playing trains. The Randy
by Dorothy Sanders (Australasian Pub-
lishing Co.) catches the eye because the
first chapter of it was published in The
Bulletin as a short story. As it was first
printed, it was a fantasy about a small
boy whose passion to go to sea resulted
in a hallucination in which he played
with an aboriginal boy, met with some
adventurous American troops from a
ship called the Randy and, as a psycho-
logical phenomenon, was handed over to
a doctor. In the published book the
Randy becomes a real ship and the boy,
sent to sea, has adventures in the late war
in the Pacific, ending in a visit to the
Abrolhos Islands; an extraordinary
change of artistic direction.
Cole’s Great Book for Boys (E. W.
Cole, Ltd., Melbourne) is the next to
speak up for itself. The heart leaps up
when one beholds a rainbow on the cover
of a large black book; remembering,
from years ago. Cole’s Funny Picture
Book; which, for all one knows, is still
on sale and still enchanting the young.
The Great Book for Boys has a colored
frontispiece of piratical-looking gentle-
men crouching above the caption “At the
sight of the gun, Tony gasped” ; so it
appears that all is still well with the race
of small boys, if not with Tony. Con-
tributors include Will Lawson and D’Arcy
Niland (with a story about Te Kooti), and
there are “strips” including a desperate
account of an invasion of the earth by
supermen from “the mobile planet
Myrtle.”
It is to be feared —or regretted, or
something—that at the date this agonised
notice is being written the Australian
publishers have not yet fully launched
their annual bombardment. Last year
large, illustrated children’s books so
beautifully produced that they called for
the most respectful attention fell as thick
as leaves in Vallombrosa, wherever that
may be. This year—so far —the finest
productions in hand are from English
publishers; Frances Dale’s The Dryad
and the Toad (Macdonald), Eileen Soper’s
Songs on the Wind (Museum Press) and
The Mighty Hunter by Berta and Elmer
Hader (Hale). The Hunter is about an
Indian boy who liked to shoot animals
and was reformed by a kindly grizzly
bear ; the Songs are pleasant verses about
village and country matters; and The
Dryad and the Toad may confidently be
recommended to collectors of dryads and
toads.
Among other English publications,
Mary Campbell’s The Three Tregunters
(Museum Press) appears at first sight to
deal with an animal hitherto unknown,
but one learns that a Tregunter is not a
bird, beast or gnome, but merely an
English soldier home on leave who goes
(accompanied by offspring) to Bucking-
ham Palace to be decorated by the King.
Helen Sewell’s Birthday Book (Hale),
mainly in pictures, is about a male infant
of the human species who wanted a dog
and got one. Winkie-Wee’s Spring
Cleaning and Winkie-Wee and the Silver
Sixpences by Christine Chaundler
(Museum Press) are very nice winkie-
wee books about a winkie-wee elf named
Winkle-wee who, rather surprisingly, in-
vents pickled onions.
A.B.C. and All That, written and illus-
trated by Gladys M. Rees (Hale), besides
reminding one that Mr. Leslie Rees (no
relation) will probably gladden the re-
viewer’s heart with another children’s
book this Christmas, purports painlessly
to teach the baby the alphabet: a very
necessary process if it is to grow up and
write children’s books. Once in a Blue
Moon by Margaret Gibbs (Hollis and
Carter) brings the gargoyles down from
the college wall to have adventures with
a tortoise; and Five Golden Wrens by
Hugh Troy" (Hale), Rusty, the Little Red
Dachshund by Dorothy K. L’Hommedieu
(Hale) and Poppel and the Runaways by
Fanny Dickens (Hollis and Carter) deal,
no doubt, with golden wrens, dach-
shunds and poppels.
To return —after a short conversation
with the Religious Editor in the temple
adjoining The Bulletin, during the
course of which a small green crocodile
ran across the ceiling and dived into a
pot of beer—to return, we say, to the
Australian writers who have thus gener-
ously sacrificed themselves, and the re-
viewer, to the spirit of seasonal goodwill,
T. Stuart Gurr offers a Mountain
of the Sleeping Giant (Australasian Pub-
lishing Co.), in which a boy, accompanied
by a boogie and a toy Battery Elephant,
sets off through the Indian jungle to look
for England. Edith Lanser’s Caroline
Listens (Australasian Publishing Co.),
mostly pictures, appears to encourage the
young to make up songs about interesting
things they see, such as wheelbarrows,
bent tricycle-wheels and (presumably)
boogies. Gladys Lister’s / Wouldn't If
I Were You (Angus and Robertson) has
two of the very young in search of a
house; profits to Sydney Day Nurseries.
Ray Harris’s The Secret of the Tide
Race (Angus and Robertson) is about
boys exploring in a ketch the rivers of
the remote North-West, where they have
suitable adventures; and Veronica
Basser’s The Martins of Montrose (Aus-
tralasian Publishing Co.) has to do with
school, sport, exams., country holidays
and other matters of importance to teen-
age girls.
This review will now cease. The re-
viewer, while trying to make up a song
about bent tricycle-wheels of interest to
teen-age girls, was treacherously bitten
by a boogie.
A Book of the Ballet.
Cornelius Conyn, whose Three Cen-
turies of Ballet has been published by
Australasian Publishing Co., has recently
been mentioned on The Bulletin’s
“Personal” page. He is a Dutchman who
has been an art and ballet critic in Paris,
has written poetry and plays and has
published a study of the Spanish folk-
dance.
During the late war he fought for the
Dutch in Sumatra and was taken prisoner
by the Japanese. Now he lives in Aus-
tralia, because he likes the country. Aus-
tralia, in return, should like his Three
Centuries of Ballet : for of its kind, and
within the limits of what it sets out to do,
it is astonishingly good.
In the first place, it is a remarkably
fine production ; a big book, admirably
bound and printed, and decorated with
a splendid set of photographs beginning
with a bas-relief of Cambodian temple-
dancers and ending with masked dancers
of Bali: between which are to be found
Pavlova, Diaghilev, Massine, Baronova
any great dancer, any great company
and any great stage spectacle you care
to look for.
Why Cornelius Conyn, who obviously
adores the grace of women and the sweet
now of line, should have included,
among a selection of pen-drawings, a
sketch by Picasso of two ballerinas with
the legs of elephants, fingers like pork
sausages, prodigious busts and the faces
of demented Roman Senators of the de-
cadent period is a mystery passing com-
prehension. Fashion, no doubt. But the
point should not be overstressed, for it
is the only lapse in a book of taste and
beauty.
Three Centuries of Ballet is not only
delightful to look at but informative and
unusually easy to read. Conyn has set
out simply to tell “the average spectator”
enough of the history of ballet and the
significance of the dance to let him know
what it is all about; then to tell him
enough about technique—without going
into unnecessary details —to give him an
appreciation of some of the fine points ;
and then, in broad outline, to survey re-
cent and contemporary ballet companies
all over the world. He writes clearly and
economically, sometimes poetically, and
he avoids, except briefly to mention them,
the furies and feuds of the ballet world
which too often make the books of the
dancers themselves unreliable and —if
lively in patches—as a whole a little
tedious.
Space and the plan of the book do not
permit Conyn to dwell as long as one
could wish on the various Australian
companies, particularly the Borovanskys,
but all recent developments from Kir-
sova to Laurel Martyn are noted, and
the photographic section, compensating
for the brevity of the text, includes a
surprisingly large proportion of Aus-
tralian designs, costumes and ballets.
Conyn’s “average spectator” should be
grateful for this book; for the ballet,
even when one has seen many companies
and read many books about it, tends to
remain a great and alarming mystery, and
Three Centuries of Ballet makes it
simple, comprehensible and companion-
able.
Among the Eskimos.
In Charles D. Brower’s Fifty Years
Below Zero (Hale, Ltd.), there is briefly
described a tragic little picture of in-
credible gluttony;
During the cutting of our second whale a
woebegone Eskimo wandered out on the ice
to where we were working and stood about
watching hungrily. His home was far in-
land, he said, arid this was the first time
he d come to the coast for many years.
Help yourself,’’ we told him, indicating
the blubber.
He made a dive for a piece and gulped
it down faster than I’d ever seen an Eskimo
dispose of food.
Half an hour or so later, Pat exclaimed;
‘Will y’ look at the man now! Faith, he’ll
be killing himself!”
Our guest was sitting flat on the ice with
his back against the carcass still bolting
blubber and reaching for more.
When next we noticed him his eyes were
glazed, his jaws motionless. He was dead.
I think he must have burst something in-
side.
Had the poor wretch succeeded in his
evident intention to dispose of a whale,
raw, at one sitting, he’d no doubt have
arisen with an Eskimo equivalent of the
classical expression of gluttony “The only
thing wrong was there wasn’t enough of
it”—a phrase that also fits Brower’s book.
Fifty Years Below Zero is sub-titled
A Lifetime of Adventure in the Far North,
which, in a sense, is doubly inaccurate.
The book does not cover Brower’s full
lifetime, for a brief prologue gives tan-
talisingly sketchy glimpses of an earlier
part of his. life —dotted not with the names
of Alaskan trading-posts, but with such
names as New York, Montevideo, Mel-
bourne, Ballarat, Callao, “a Peruvian
hell-hole called Huanillos,” Liverpool,
Cape Horn, Calcutta, Dublin, San Fran-
cisco. All that disposed of in four pages,
Brower moves on to begin his “lifetime ’
as (expressed in -an introduction by
Vilhjalmur Stefansson)“ Uncle Sam’s
most northerly citizen America’s most
northerly pioneer friend of most of
the explorers, whalers, traders and
missionaries who have reached or passed
the north tip of Alaska since 1884.”
Brower obviously loves the north —a
man must have a deep love to blind him
for 50 years to the faults of such a hard,
cold and temperamental mistress; and
she, for that matter, must have her com-
pensating charms. But possibly even
more he loves the native people of the
north, the Eskimos; their sometimes
ruthless, sometimes childlike, usually
practical philosophy and way of life;
their superstitions ; their mixture of primi-
tiveness (when he first knew them) and
ingenuity. He has been able to study
them throughout a period of transition
from their original state to an inevitable
acceptance of the mixed blessings of
civilisation, and lie has made a study of
them —he married one.
For Brower’s study of the Eskimo
alone the book is worth reading ; added
to that is an infinity of assorted adventure
and a diversity of experience, all related
in a free and pleasant style with a liberal
salting of humor and without one word
of padding ; the only fault, if any, lies in
the- other direction —an often too brief
and casual mention of things on which
one would have him dwell.
War in Burma.
Roy McKelvie’s War in Burma
(Methuen), on a subject covering some
of the most savage hand-to-hand fighting
of the war, is written with a restraint
that verges on bloodlessness.
A British military observer under
Mountbatten, McKelvie is obviously well-
informed —armies, divisions, commanding
officers and so on are moved over Burma
with h.q. facility; and with the same
distant detachment. His account is like
an overall aircraft coverage of Burma,
where what the reader thirsts for is a
dive into the jungle of actual experience.
For instance: “Jack Knight of the
124th Cavalry earned undying fame when
he was killed leading his troop against
a Jap-held hill.” Here is something, you
think, out of the box. Most troop-leaders
who were killed were leading their men
against enemy positions, yet this one is
worth special mention. But instead of a
page or two of how Jack Knight earned
undying fame among a body of fighters
whose own fame had become a legend,
you find yourself shifted in the next line
300 miles further south.
The book is full of similar unfulfilled
promises, and of all the commanders
mentioned one only is described satisfy-
ingly: Major-General Frank Festing,
commander of the famous British 36th
Division, injected by Mountbatten into
General Stilwefl’s northern Burma com-
mand to restore strained Anglo-American
relations. The excellent picture of Festing,
with a brief flash of arresting writing of
the battle for Kohima (which earned the
merciless Cameron Highlanders the Jap
appellation of “Churchill’s Murderers”),
shows what McKelvie could have made of
the whole bitter campaign if he’d dealt
with men and battles instead of armies
and dispositions.
As it is, the book has about as much
detailed penetration as a war com-
munique, McKelvie’s is a map-war, with
the disposition of its fighters meaningless
without constant reference to maps. But
detailed mention of these British units
and the areas through which they hacked
their long, cruel path serves at least one
good purpose—it effectively refutes Errol
Flynn’s celluloid claim to be Savior of
Burma.
Reviewed Briefly.
British Samplers: Mary Eirwen Jones
(Pen-in-Hand Co., Oxford). By some
mistake, this elegant work on the history
of samplers, with photographs of Eliza-
bethan and later needlework, found its
way to The Bulletin instead of to the
“Woman’s Mirror,” to which it was
addressed. It is a learned and dainty
piece of goods and is hereby recom-
mended to anyone interested; in parti-
cular, to the editor of the “Woman’s
Mirror.”

Malleus Malefcarum : Translated, with

the Rev. Montague Summers (Pushkin
Press). A document on witchcraft stated
to have been written by two Dominicans
in 1484. The book is printed in double
columns on poor paper, making it diffi-
cult to read, but it contains an extra-
ordinary amount of extraordinary in-
formation concerning witches, demons
and other medieval equivalents of the
bunyip. Edition limited to 2000 copies.

My Lord of Wry bourne: Jeffery Famol
(Sampson Low ; Robertson and Mullens).
The jacket says that many of the char-

present reviewer seems to remember, from
Mr. Farnol’s previous novels, every word
of it; but upon Mr. Famol, his readers
and his romances let there be light and
peace.

What chemical stimulants should be
used to accelerate growth of vegetable
plants ?
Give cabbages and cauliflowers fort-
nightly doses of a mixture of 2oz. sul-
phate of ammonia and loz. sulphate
of iron diluted in one gallon of water.
Beetroot, onions, beans, peas, spinach,
carrots and parsnips can be helped
with a dusting of superphosphate. Let-
tuces grow quickly when a light dress-
ing of sulphate of ammonia or nitrate
of soda is spread through the plants
and watered heavily. For rhubarb
stable or fowl manure is the best
hustler. In all forcing treatment it is
essential that the manures are not
sprinkled on the foliage and plenty of
water given.

Details concerning the boxer Dave
Sands?
Sands was born at Burnt Bridge via
Kempsey (N.S.W.), on February 4,
1926. Real name is Davis Ritchie.
Began boxing in 1943, and is generally
regarded as middleweight, light-heavy-
weight and heavyweight champion of
Australia. Sands kayoed Jack Kirk-
ham for middleweight title at Sydney
Stadium on May 11, 1946, and Jack
Johnson for light-heavyweight cham-
pionship at Sydney Stadium on
August 24, 1946. Johnson claims he
was never beaten for his heavyweight
honors, but Johnson has evidently re-
tired, and boxing critics recognise
Sands as a triple champion (middle,
light-heavy and heavyweight) of Aus-
tralia.

RECOLLECTIONS OF THE WRECK OF THE
LY-EE-MOON, AUSTRALIA, JULY, 1886.
In the awful panic
Brave men on the deck
Fought to save lives
In the midst of the wreck.
At the mercy of the wild
And roaring waves
Victims were swept
To watery graves
On a winter night
Dark misty and cold
In the calamity died
Young people and old.


PLEASE TO
REMEMBER
By J.B.BLAIR
I WAS dut of bed very early. Like
most seven-year-olds I usually awoke
with the sun, but that morning I
beat him easily. I had awakened
several times looking for the first glimmer
of daylight—perhaps I had not really
been to sleep at all —and at last, unable
to contain my impatience any longer, I
slipped out of bed, dressed in the dark
and crept out of the room. My sister
sleepily asked where I was going.
“Out with the Hall boys, like I told
you,” I whispered, and was off without
waiting for further comment or questions.
OUTSIDE there was a faint flicker of
dawn as I hurried across the road,
climbed the fence and ran across the
paddock to the Halls’ place. There was
no sign of the boys, so I stopped at the
gate. I wasn’t game to go inside. Their
kangaroo-dog, although an arrant
coward like most of his breed, had my
measure; I was scared of him and he
knew it. As a legacy of my shame I
loathe his tribe to this day.
I sat down on a stump to wait for the
Hall boys, and as I waited my mind
leapt ahead in gleeful anticipation of the
morning’s doings. It was Guy Fawkes
Day—to the youngsters of our small
South Australian town one of the really
great festivals of the year. From day-
break until it was time to go to school
boys dressed as “guys” would be chanting
rhymes and pestering housewives for
money “for the guy.”
Money collected, together with any
that could be coaxed out of parents,
would later in the day be expended on
the purchase of fireworks, and in the
evening there would be grand revelry
around the many bonfires that had been
built up during the preceding few weeks.
In other years my role had been that of
onlooker; this time I was to play an
active part —a speaking part, too, for I
had learnt all the doggerel that goes with
the day, and only the previous afternoon
I had repeated some of the rhymes to
the Hall boys to prove my worthiness to
join their team. Roly, who at fourteen
was almost a full-grown man to me, had
been unwilling to accept me, but Rupert,
two years younger and more sympathetic,
had persuaded him to let me come.
L SEEMED to be sitting on that stump
I for ages. It was quite light and I was
beginning to think they had got up early
and given me the slip, when I heard
voices and saw them coming towards me.
My first impulse was to run for my
life, for they* were fearsome objects.
They wore costumes made out of sugar-
bags, old felt hats which had been pur-
posely battered out of shape, and their
faces were hidden behind frightening
masks. Each had a bundle slung on his
back, and from the mouth of each pro-
truded an old clay pipe. Tradition,
which had handed down the rhymes
connected with the day, hadn’t told our
town much about the style of clothes
affected by Messer Guido Fawkes; that
item was left to individual taste, which
in most cases meant dressing up like a
down-and-out sundowner and wearing
the fiercest mask procurable. The Halls
had chosen masks Lon Chaney or Boris
Karloff would have been proud to wear.
“Hullo, young ’un,” said Rupert—l
knew it must be Rupert because he was
the smaller of the two —“so you got
here?”
“Yes,” I said. “Gee, you look good-
oh.”
“We’ve got to get the guy yet,” an-
nounced Roly. “It’s down in the stable.”
We walked across to the stable and
opened the door. Roly 'Struck a match
and Rupert went in and wheeled out a
billycart in which lolled a rather shape-
less effigy made out of a ohaffbag stuffed
with old rags and dressed, rather incon-
gruously, in a modern coat, collar and
tie, and surmounted by a cocked hat.
Like its human colleagues it wore a mask
and a clay-pipe. For some reason the
mask was that of a circus clown, and the
broad grin it wore seemed a little out of
place in a man about to be hanged,
drawn and quartered. Not that I
noticed anything funny about that at the
time. I couldn’t imagine a finer guy.
There were ropes tied to the billycart.
Roly took hold of them.
“I’ll pull it for' a start,” he said to
Rupert “You carry the hat.”
Rupert picked up an old cabbage-tree
hat that was resting on the guy’s pro-
truding stomach. It was to act as a col-
libcting-box.
“What about the kid?”
he asked. “Oughtn’t we
dress him up?”
“I’ll fix him,” said
Roly.
He picked up a sugar-
bag, jagged a couple of
holes in it with his pocket-
knife and pulled it down
over my head. I wriggled
my skull through the main
hole and my arms through
two others.
“Better give him a moustache,” sug-
gested Rupert.
“Soon fix that,” said his brother.
He dabbed his finger into the axle-
grease on a wheel of the dray that was
standing there and decorated my top lip.
“Better have a beard, too,” he decided,
and rubbed some more of the filthy stuff
on my chin. Rupert put a hat on my
head —the Hall family must have pos-
sessed an endless stock of old hats—
and my disguise was complete. Roly
took the ropes again and we moved off.
There was only one thing to spoil the
occasion from my point of view. The
boys’ tan kangaroo-dog had slunk up
along the fence and attached himself to
the party. He brushed against me care-
lessly and bounded around me in circles
a couple of times as though to show me
that my disguise was not deceiving him
for one moment. Then he darted ahead
for fifty yards, doubled back and padded
along beside the billycart.
“We’ll try the Morgans first,” an-
nounced Roly.
The Morgan house was two hundred
yards across the flat. It stood by itself,
without a fence. We pulled up outside
it and began our chant:
Please to remember the Fifth of November,
Gunpowder treason and plot.
Don’t see the reason
Gunpowder treason
Should ever be forgot.
Up shot a window and out poked a
head.
“Hell, you kids get earlier every year,”
said old man Morgan. “Don’t you ever
Sleep?”
We were too wrapped up in our job to
give him an answer.
Guy Fawkes, Guy,
Stick him up high,
Stick him on a lamp-post,
Leave him there to die.
MRS. MORGAN was at the window,
too, now. “What a pretty guy! ” she
remarked. Pretty hardly seemed the right
word for our effigy. I looked at Roly
and Rupert, but if their faces registered
any disgust at this typically feminine
description it was mercifully hidden by
their masks. On went the song.
Half-a-crown to cut him down,
A pound of cheese to choke him;
A bottle of wine to wash it down,
A yard, of rope to hang him.
I lagged behind a bit over that verse —
I couldn’t quite see the sense in cutting
him down before .we hanged him —but
I came in again strongly with:
Christmas is coming,
Geese are getting fat,
Please put a penny
In the old guy’s hat.
If you haven’t got a penny
A ha’penny’ll do.
If you haven’t got a ha’penny
God bless you.
The others were content to let it go at
that, but I was properly wound up by
now and kept blithely on:
One a penny, two a penny,
Hot cross buns;
If you have no daughters
Give ’em to your sons;
If you-
ii O HUT up! ” said Roly. “This is Guy
Fawkes Day, not Good Friday.”
I shut up.
“Who’s the little chap?” asked Mrs.
Morgan,
The Hall boys did not
answer. Probably they felt
she had had enough for her
money, which, anyway, wasn’t
forthcoming sp far. They held
up their hats.
“Remember the guy. Penny
for the guy.”
The Morgans were kindly
folk. At the direct appeal they
threw down several pennies,
which were quickly retrieved
and placed in “the old guy’s hat.” We
waved our thanks and went on our way.
“Kings’ next,” said Roly. “Then
Porters’.”
A couple of minutes later we were
going through our act again, loudly and
with gusto. The
Kings were gen-
erous, so were the
Porters ; there were
threepences amongst
the coins they
threw. I began
wondering what my share
would be and planning what
I’d buy with it.
“Now for Mrs. Blake,” said Roly.
Mrs. Blake was an elderly widow who
lived in a little shanty infested with cats
and chickens.
. “She won’t give us any money —I don’t
think she’s got any,” Rupert explained
to me, “but she always gives us cakes or
something to eat. Keep quiet. Splinter.
Don’t touch those chickens.”
Splinter hung back in our wake as we
neared the hut.
We gave the old lady our full number
and, fortified by thoughts of the cake to
come, sang
If you haven’t got a ha’penny
God bless you
with special fervor. We weren’t disap-
pointed. Out came the old soul with
cakes, cups and a jug of milk. She ex-
amined our disguises at close quarters,
we drank the milk and went on our way
munching the cakes.
Rupert was pulling the billycart now
and he went to cross the road.
“Not over there,” Roly warned him.
“That’s the Conwaytown mob’s territory.”
Rupert came back. It wasn’t that there
was a gentlemen’s agreement to be ob-
served ; he knew, as even I did, that the
Conwaytown mob was quite capable of
using force to see that their domain was
not invaded.
THE procession of three boys, a dog
and a guy passed on from house to
house. Our reception was not always the
same. Twice we were told to get to hell
out of it and once, at the Johnsons’ place,
a well-directed stone knocked the guy’s
hat off. There was no sign of the thrower,
but Roly and Rupert marked young Joe
Johnson down for future vengeance and
we resumed our pilgrimage. We were
almost out of range when there was a
yelp from Splinter; Joe had scored an-
other direct hit.
My senior partners yelled back threats
at the concealed marksman, and I tried
to hide my pleasure at the discomfiture
of my enemy. Splinter himself wasn’t
concerned about our feelings ; he was al-
ready halfway across the paddocks, head-
ing for home and safety.
“No good trying the Flannagans,” said
Roly as we approached the next house.
“Old Flannagan don’t believe in it.”
Their father’s belief or lack of it did
not prevent the three Flannagan boys
from climbing up on the fence for a free
look. The eldest, a scraggy lad of fifteen,
called out to Roly: “That; our brother in
the cart, Hally? Gee, he looks like you.”
Roly bent down to pick up a clod of
dirt and the three Flannagans dropped
down on their own side of the fence. We
threw a few clods of dirt at the fence as
we passed, and went on to seek more
profitable fields. The Harrises were good
to us, so were the Akehursts and the
Seegers and the Youngs. Our bank was
mounting up well. We sang our “Please
to Remembers” with growing enthusiasm,
even if we cut short some of the rigmarole
in the knowledge that time was running
out and we still had plenty of places to
visit.
We called on them all —the Stratfords,
the Dorters, the Coopers, the Manns, the
Bakers and a host of others whose names
I cannot after this space of years recall.
The “old guy’s hat” was getting pretty
heavy by the time we reached
my own home, last port of call
before returning to base.
We put on our full turn
there and I, at any rate, gave
it all I had. My mother came
to the door as we finished.
“Please to put a penny in
the old guy’s hat,” chanted
Rupert.
“No,” said my mother. “I
want to give it to that little
chap with the black beard.”
She was pretending she hadn’t recog-
nised me, and as far as I was concerned
she succeeded. I stepped forward, aglow
with pride in the disguise that could de-
ceive even my own mother. I reached out
my hand for the proffered sixpence. Then
I spoilt the effect.
“Thank you, Mum,” I said.
' “Hurry back to breakfast,” she told
me, “or you’ll be late for school.”
THE cavalcade of guys went across to
the Halls’ stable to resume their own
identities. Roly tipped the money out of
the hat and began to count it. I dropped
the sixpence in with the rest and stood
there fascinated as he sorted the copper
and silver into heaps, wondering how
much my share be. I couldn’t
expect a third, I decided ; probably they’d
give me a quarter or a fifth. If it was
a pound a fifth would be? Sums
weren’t my strong point, but a fifth of a
pound would be quite a lot of money.
Roly finished his counting.
“One pound four and nine,” he an-
nounced.
“That’s six bob better than last year,”
said Rupert. “It’ll be twelve and four-
pence each.”
He paused and looked at me. “Oh, I
forgot about the kid. “Let’s see, three
into twenty four and nine...”
“What d’you mean?” said Roly. “The
kid only came round for the fun of it.
We didn’t ask him. He pestered us to
let him come. You didn’t expect any
money, did you, Jimmy?”
I certainly had expected some, but I
didn’t know how to say so.
“After all,” Roly continued, “it was
our idea, and we made the guy, and it
was our billycart and our clothes. Why,
that hat you’re wearing is ours and so is
the sugarbag.”
At this I felt terribly mean, and
wondered how I had dared to think I
might be entitled to a share of the takings.
Why, I even had their axle-grease on my
face. I hoped he wouldn’t think of that.
“Better give him something, though,”
said Rupert. “After all, we’ve got nearly
twenty-five bob.”
“I’ll tell you what,” said Roly. “How
much did your mother give you?”
“Sixpence,” I told him.
“Well, you can have that. That’s fair
enough. After all, if you hadn’t been
with us she’d still have given us the
money, so it’s really us that’s giving it
to you, isn’t it?”
“Ye-es,” I agreed as he handed me the
sixpence, and I was halfway home before
I began to have my doubts.
WE were coming home from school
late that afternoon when my sister
saw the blaze.
“Look!” she called. “The bonfire’s
burning.”
There were piles of wood and rubbish
all round the town that would later in the
evening be blazing bonfires, but to us
“the bonfire” meant only one thing—the
pyre in Lodge’s paddock which would be
the centre of our own pyrotechnic acti-
vities. And there it was, burning away
to ashes in broad daylight three hours
before its destined time. There were
several other youngsters with us, all with
a direct personal interest in the disaster,
and we ran towards the blaze as fast as
we could, eager .to know the worst.
When we got there it was almost oyer,
and what had been an imposing-looking
edifice of combustible material a brief
half-hour before was merely a heap of
glowing coals and ashes.
My sister howled outright and most of
us felt like doing the same.
“It was that Conwaytown mob that
done it,” volunteered a lad who had got
there before us. We didn’t need his tell-
ing. We had all guessed as much before
we got there. The premature lighting of
other peoples’ bonfires was an accepted
article of war in our gang feuds, and the
Conwaytown mob had always been
jealous of the Lodge bonfire, the biggest
thing of its kind in our town’s Guy
Fawkes festivities.
I don’t remember just what function Mr.
1 Lodge performed in the general life of
the town; I recall him as a short, grey-
bearded old man who used to drive past
our house in a dog-cart distinguished by a
very small pony and a very long whip—
the latter for decorative purposes only;
no one ever saw him use it on the pony.
But whatever it was he did on the other
364 days of the year, on Guy Fawkes
night he came into his own. TTie Lodge
bonfire was built by his three sons at
his instigation, and not only did he see
that his boys Were provided with a store
of fireworks second to none in the town,
Jbut he also laid in on his own account a
stock of crackers and bungers for dis-
tribution among the youngsters who
crowded around his annual bonfire.
His enthusiasm for the festival was
unbounded—just why, I cannot say.
Psychologists would perhaps explain his
passion as a suppressed longing stored up
from childhood. Possibly he was a pyro-
maniac whd managed to keep his
dangerous urge under control so long as
he was able to indulge in this one orgy
of fire one night a year. In that case

ATOM TRICKERY.
•
Soviet delegate Vyshinsky’s
atom-bomb proposal to the
current session of U.N.O. was,
with his disarmament proposal,
demonstrable propaganda
trickery, and the demonstration
needs to be given in plain and
simple terms.
Otherwise the calculated Com-
munist propaganda—that Mos-
cow has made genuine offers—
might be accepted by some,
though by now all Communist
propaganda, like Hitler’s before
it, must have just about defeated
itself.
The trickery in the Vyshinsky
“offer” is simply that (1) it in-
sists that the U.S. must destroy
its stockpile of atom-bombs and
give up the atom-bomb as a
weapon; and (2), while it ap-
pears to agree to inspection, it
places this under the Security
Council, where the power of
veto rules.
That is to say, the U*S. having
destroyed its atom-bombs, the
Soviet delegate in the Security
Council could prevent any in-
spection by merely using the
veto —plainly a proposal that
could not be accepted by other
than simpletons.
The U.S, proposal included
both the apparent Vyshinsky
provisions of destruction of the
atom-bomb stock and inspec-
tion ; the offer to destroy the en-
tire stock of already manufac-
tured atom-bombs and not
manufacture any more being,
very sensibly, subject to one
condition —that there be set up
an effective international body
and that this body have effec-
tive control over all atomic
energy in all forms and in all
countries, with no veto in force.
Based on the original plan
drawn up by Bernard M.
Baruch —this plan itself both a
remarkable product of brilliant
thinking and unprecedented as
an example of international
goodwill and generosity—the
U.S. proposal in its final form
was the work of experts from
14 nations carried on over some
two and a half years. In con-
trast to the latest Vyshinsky
proposal, which was —no doubt
deliberately—vague and general,
with the Security-Council veto
to be played at any time, the
final proposal drawn up by those
international experts w<a s
specific, detailed and technical.
It needs emphasising over and
over that it is due to Soviet
hindrance alone that that plan
has not been put into effect;
thus the whole responsibility for
the continued threat of atomic
warfare is a Soviet responsi-
bility.
The U.S. position was recently
clearly summarised by N. Y.
“Herald Tribune” Washington
correspondent Mark Sullivan in
the following comments:
“Immediately after the first
impact of the atomic bomb on
the world, in Japan on August
6, 1945, we [U.S.] took the
initiative in steps to assure that
the atomic bomb be banished
from the world. By our initia-
tive there was set up, within the
United Nations, the Atomic
Energy Commission, in which
17 nations have been repre-
sented. The report made by this
commission, one of the great
documents of the modern world,
is an attempt to bring the mind
of man up to the level of the
change wrought in the material
world by the atomic bomb. It
goes the utmost length of putting
atomic energy under interna-
tional control, involving com-
plete surrender by us of our
bombs, the materials for them
and the knowledge % of how to
make them.
“The report of the Atomic
Energy Commission would set
up an international body, and
to this body would give absolute
and exclusive ownership of all
the uranium and thorium any-
where in the world. This body
Indianapolis (U.S.A.) “Star.”

wouid have exclusive authority
to own and manage or license all
facilities for producing atomic
energy anywhere. It would have
the right to inspect anything
having to do with atomic energy
at any place in any country at
any time, including military
establishments.
“This proposal has been
agreed to by 14 of the 17 nations
that have been on the Atomic
Energy Commission. It is op-
posed by Russia, as well as the
Ukraine and Poland. The
Ukraine delegate said [in the
current U.N.O. session] that the
‘Soviet delegates would rather
have their arms cut off than
vote for such a fantastic organ’
as the international control
body.
“That is the picture and the
problem. If there is to be inter-
national control of atomic
energy, if no nation is to have
advantage from it, neither we
nor any other ; if atomic war is
to cease to be a danger and a
fear —there it all is. There lies
the real situation for world
opinion to pass judgment on.
There lies the real test of
whether the Russian proposal
was sincere.”
Actually, the real test hinges
upon the Security-Council veto.
Vyshinsky, of course, made no
mention of this, but it was,
quite rightly, made a major fea-
ture by Baruch in originally out-
lining the U.S. proposal, and
has been emphasised by him in
various subsequent speeches.
Baruch made a special distinc-
tion between the veto system as
applied to any other matters and
as applied to atomic energy, as
shown in the following extracts
from one of his statements;
“I want to make it very plain
that I am concerned here with
the veto power only as it affects
this particular problem [atomic
energy]. There must be no veto
to protect those who violate
their solemn agreements not to
develop or use atomic energy for
destructive purposes.
“I digress here to remind all
0 f us that when the United
Nations was founded the atomic
bomb was unknown. Therefore,
it is apparent that the processes
set up in the Charter did not —
could not—deal with this preg-
nant subject.
“I take it that I need not labor
the point of punishment. It is
obvious that an offender should
be debarred from sitting in
judgment of his own guilt.
“The success of the commis-
sion in dealing with this subject
will be the keynote of our de-
liberation. It will mean world
protection or world destruction.
There is no time for delay or
debate or technical block. Once
criminal violation of the code is
proven—immediate and condign
punishment must follow.”
In another speech Baruch
further stated that there must
be “provision that no nation
which has accepted the interna-
tional control treaty can be pro-
tected from punishment for vio-
lation of its terms through use
of a veto whether cast by the
violating State or by any other
nation.”
Those merely normally sane
control terms all countries bar
Russia and its puppets are
eager to accept in order that the
atomic threat shall be banished
from the earth. U.N.O. has at
least served the purpose of mak-
ing that position unmistakeably
clear, and hence of putting the
responsibility for perpetuation
of the threat squarely where it
belongs.
The Vyshinsky proposal for
a one-third cut in armaments
was just as demonstrably a mere
piece of Soviet propaganda
trickery. The position in this
simply is that, while the U.S.
and Britain hastily—as it turns
out, incredibly foolishly
heavily disarmed in the first
couple of years after the fight-
ing, there has been no compar-
able disarming in Soviet Russia.
Obviously, the Soviet-proposed
cut in all “present land, naval
and air forces” would work
wholly to the Soviet advantage
—even if it could be accepted
that Moscow would carry out
its part of any such idiots’
arrangement.
Like the Soviet atomic-inspec-
tion proposal, the disarmament
proposed by Vyshinsky was also
to be supervised by a control
body “within the framework of
the Security Council.” That, of
course, means only one thing—
that the Soviet veto would be
used as soon as it was needed to
serve Soviet ends.
One final point should not be
overlooked. When the U.S.
atom-bomb offer was first put
forward there was still trust in
the Russian word. That word
has meanwhile been proved even
more worthless than Hitler’s.
Who now would trust Russian
agreement on anything how-
ever innocuous, let alone on such
a thing as the atom-bomb?
Peace Fallacy.
In N. Y. “Herald Tribune”
Walter Lippmann points out a
fallacy that has dogged the
peace-making so far the
idea that wars cannot be settled
except by the continuing co-
operation of the victors in ad-
ministering the affairs of the de-
feated nation.
For this notion, the writer in-
sists, there were no historic pre-
cedents, nor has there ever been
any plausible justification for
imagining that the “newfangled
and quite bizarre” experiment it
led to could have been made to
work: ,
“Even among the most like-
minded nations a condominium,
that is to say the governing of
an area by several alien Gov-
ernments, has always proved to
be unworkable. Applied to
Germany by Governments which
are irreconcilably contrary-
minded, it reflected a complete
misunderstanding of Germany,
of Russia, of Europe, of the
United States and of the nature
of things.
“It was never possible, and it
will never be possible, for four
Powers, severally or jointly, to
govern Germany, to re-educate
the Germans, to make a Ger-
man Constitution or, sitting in
Berlin or Frankfurt or Dussel-
dorf, to plan, to control and to
regulate the revival of Germany
so as to suit their own varied
predilections.”
In that hopeless experiment it
has not been merely Russia
standing pat that has blocked the
peace-making: there are differ-
ences of view even between
U.S. and Britain, and on some
points France differs as widely
from the rest as the Kremlin
does. Unless they’re prepared to
continue indefinitely snarling at
each other or fight it out, all
the victors can now do is, as
Lippmann rightly concludes,
“to make reasonable terms of
peace as quickly as possible, and
then go away, leaving the van-
quished to face the responsibili-
ties of their own reconstruction
and to adjust themselves to the
international system which the
new balance of power, resulting
from the war, has brought into
being.”
French Occupation.
Although British and Ameri-
can occupation policy is coming
in for a fair amount of criticism,
even more is being directed at
the French, who, it appears, are
achieving little in the way of
ironing out the old Franco-
Prussian antipathies.
If not such hungry visitors as
the Russians, the French are at
least making such a good show
of using all they can on the spot
and removing what they can’t
that Germans in the French zone
are looking longingly towards
its promised merger with the
British and U.S. zones.
Describing the situation, “Wall
Street Journal” correspondent
Joseph C. Evans states that thp
normal ration in the French zone
this year (it was a starvation 800
calories last year) is 1700-1800
calories a day compared with a
minimum of 1845 and a maxi-
mum of 3190 calories in the
American zone. French occupa-
tion forces have been living
mainly off the land, and a Ger-
man farmer, quoted as a typical
case, laments that his herd of
23 cows has dwindled to three
during the occupation, while his
brother in the British zone still
has 40 of an original 43.
There is little evidence yet of
the French fulfilling their pro-
mise to give up the removal of
agricultural products. Marshall-
aid flour and a good harvest
have improved the quality and
quantity of bread, but fresh
meat and butter are being ex-
ported to France in return for
inferior frozen meats and mar-
garine.
The business and industrial
outlook is also gloomy and more
than Marshall aid is needed for
economic recovery. Business-
men want private foreign invest-
ments, especially American, “to
give more. strength to the deut-
schemark, and for the kind of
connections they would bring.”
Badly-needed long-term credit
is practically unobtainable, while

short-term loans are prohibitively
expensive.
As for the French reparations
policy, “the particular case of
the clock-making industry in the
Tuebingen area in south Wuert-
temberg has become something
of a cause celebre. The French
justify this by pointing out that
the actual number of machines
left to the industry will be
slightly more than in 1936, when
already some 15 per cent, of
production was for war pur-
poses. This reasoning, of
course, leaves out of account the
fact that many of the machines
removed are critical and irre-
placeable.
“But what many Germans
object to more than reparations
are the removals undertaken as
restitutions. During 1946 and
'1947 a vast number of machines
were removed on the theory that
they had been looted from
France. Certainly many were,
but it is equally certain that
many were bought and paid for
in the normal conduct of busi-
ness, and it is highly probable
that many never originated in
France at all.
“One German economist
claims that recovery has been
hindered by these industrial re-
movals equally as much as by
war damage.
“There are also reparations
from current production, which
do not appear on any repara-
tions account. Thus one Kob-
lenz factory was producing, until
currency reform, 100 per cent,
on French orders—nothing for
Germany. Nor was this excep-
tional; of the 80 firms in the
trade association to which this
plant belonged, 90 per cent, of
production was for the occupa-
tion authorities. Some of this
remained in Germany, but a
great deal did not.”
Why Britain Lags.
Having looked closely into
Britain’s.. current production
effort, American engineer and in-
dustrialist Richards W. Cotton
wrote his analysis of why it is
lagging. The following extracts
give his main views and recom-
mendations (inferentially his an-
alysis indicates why U.S. leads ;
also, some of his criticism applies
equally to Australia); —■
“Obstacles to success in carry-
ing out E.R.P. in Britain are the
same which prevented her from
remaining in the forefront of
efficient production during the-
past 25 years. These obstacles
include restriction of output, pro-
tection of the least efficient enter-
prises, resistance to standardisa-
tion, little acceptance of mass-
production principles, and a
rather static industrial system in
which few of the top man-
agement worked up from the
ranks and in which the excep-
tional worker has little incentive
to work to the top. Not all of
British industry exhibits such
tendencies*
“A frequent explanation of the
slowness of Britain’s industrial
recovery since the war is that she
has a manpower shortage.
Numerically, this is not so. More
people are employed today in
Britain than ever before. With
more tasks to be done and more
people to do them, the chief
reason for a labor shortage is
that output a man-hour is still
down.
“Only a small section of
British industry has embraced
mass-production. Most Euro-
peans, in fact, do not understand
the difference between mass-pro-
duction and quantity production.
They mistakenly believe that
they engage in mass-production
when they turn out products in
great numbers.
“In true mass-production the
work is so organised and parts
are so standardised that no man
performs work which a machine
can do. Quantity production is
overgrown job-shop practice in
which men with tools perform
a variety of tasks or work that in
mass-production would be done
by machines.
“In much of British quantity
production, management has
been too reluctant to provide
up-to-date equipment; and in in-
dustries in which prices are based
on production costs of the least
efficient manufacturers there is
no incentive to modernise equip-
ment and to step up output a
man-hour.
“When mass-production com-
petes with quantity production in
the same industry the burden
falls heaviest on the quantity-
production working man. He
gets lower pay because more
people are making fewer goods
than under well-organised mass-
Washington “Post.”
"FIVE MINUTES, EH?”
production methods. Too few
Britishers, particularly too few
British laboring men, understand
the fact
“Restriction of output has
been a practice of both British
labor and management. For
more than half a century British
labor unions have clung to the
philosophy that a man who
works too hard to increase his
output an hour soon works him-
self out of a job. Because of
that philosophy, unions for many
years have adopted restrictive
practices which limited the out-
put a man-hour in various in-
dustries. This doctrine, that in-
creased efficiency decreases em-
ployment, reduces British
workers’ output to that of their
least efficient members.
“British management is as
much responsible as labor for
restriction of output a man-hour.
Various industries formed asso-
ciations or rings for the purpose
of reducing competition, limit-
ing production and fixing prices.
Just as the unions limited out-
put to the producing abilities of
their least efficient members, so
did industrial associations or
rings set their prices at a figure
where the least efficient member
could make a profit. Under such
circumstances there was little in-
centive for management to in-
crease productive efficiency, be-
cause one could be highly profit-
able by remaining inefficient.
“The United States working
man feels that his future is in
his own hands. The British
working man feels that, with rare
exceptions and irrespective of
ability, he is restricted from
rising to management by his own
effort. This is due partly to a
traditional class system, partly
to a leadership which helps to
preserve that class system by pro-
moting class solidarity. Conse-
quently, instead of graduating
from the bench to the front
office, an exceptional working
man usually moves into trade-
union work and perhaps eventu-
ally into political leadership.
“Few of those in the top man-
agement in British industry have
come from the ranks. Nor is it
customary for heirs to manage-
ment to have a technical educa-
tion and then ‘learn the business’
by starting in the shop and work-
ing through all phases of the
organisation. Thus the gulf be-
tween labor and management is
wider in Britain than in the
United States,
“Few mechanical improve-
ments have come from the ranks.
Management pretty generally
overlooks the fact that in the
ranks there may be some brains.
It offers little or no incentive
for men in the shop to contribute
ideas.
“To attain efficiency in pro-
duction British industry must
modernise. Before modernisa-
tion can take place British labor
and management must change
their traditional thinking and be-
come modern in outlook.
“Although tradition-bound by
a class system the Briton sturdily
holds to the dignity of personal
liberty. Along with clinging to
tradition is a highly-deyeloped
tendency to listen to reason.
Along with adjustability is a de-
termination, when backs are to
the wall, to see things through.
Economic recovery to a great
extent will depend on how those
traits are directed and employed
—whether they are stimulated or
antagonised.”
Exit Mendel.
It has not yet been reported
that anyone has succeeded in
obtaining free light in the form
of luminous eggs from fowls fed
on glowworms, but it is fairly
certain that when the claim is
made it will come from Moscow
and that the claimant will be
one T. D. Lysenko.
Mr. Lysenko, it is recalled by
Joseph and Stewart Alsop, in
N. Y. “Herald Tribune,” is the
eminent Soviet agricultural bio-
logist who stunned lesser foreign
scientists, including Julian Hux-
ley, when they were permitted
to visit him in Moscow shortly
after the war. After dismissing
“foreign bourgeois genetics’-’ in
favor of “Marxist-Stalinist gen-
etics,” Lysenko described a
system of plant-breeding which
“flew flat in the face of every
established principle of biology.”
Such doubts as Huxley and
company may have entertained
were then dispelled by a bowl of
tomatoes which made any bour-
geois champion of champions
look like an undersized cherry.
Unfortunately, one of the
visitors managed to smuggle out
one of the oversized specimens,
which turned out to be pure wax.
Mr, Lysenko, however, was
not dismayed, and while the
world was occupied y/ith the
Berlin crisis and similar lesser
things “Pravda” edified its
Moscow readers with reports of
the battle between Lysenko and
such genuine Russian scientists
as A. R. Zhebrak, I. Schmal-
hauzen and B. M. Zavadovsky,
who w§re under fire for their
“foreign bourgeois deviations.”
Apparently Mr. Lysenko had
too much influence in his corner,
and the scientists lost out after
a short contest As “Wall Street
Journal” notes, they had previ-
ously agreed with Western
scientists who, following Mendel
(a Catholic priest), “believe that
the inheritance of one genera-
tion from its parents follows
fixed laws applicable to plants,
animals and people. Thus, ac-
quired characteristics of one
generation are not passed on to
the next. The Soviet doctrine
is that this is unfair to posterity
and hence cannot be counten-
anced.
“The bourgeois view did not
bow easily. T. D. Lysenko, who
sponsored the new party line,
has spent 10 years trying to con-
vince other Russian scientists
that they were swallowing
Western propaganda. A few re-
actionaries clung to the old-
fashioned laboratory data as late
as this month, when' a Soviet
conference of geneticists was
held.
“ ‘Pravda’ relates how the
change came about. Mr. Lysen-
ko read a paper attacking the
Mendelian theory. The classi-
cists spoke up vigorously until
Mr. Lysenko announced that his
paper had been approved by the
Central Committee of the Com-
munist party. The opposition
then faded and a unanimous
resolution was adopted repealing
Mendel’s law.”
Dragnet Digest.
Overboomed Bear. —The U.S. Mili-
tary Governor in Berlin, General Clay,
is reported in “N. Y. “Daily Mirror”
as telling members of Congress visit-
ing him that “we have overestimated
Russian military might,” that “Soviet
power has been grossly magnified,”
and that actually “Russia hasn’t the
industrial power or communications
to back up her armies.”

European Union. —Mr. Duncan
Sandys, writing in London “Times”
as executive chairman of the Inter-
national Committee of the Movements
for European Union: “A European
union of whatever nature will be no-
thing but an illusion unless it obtains
the effective participation of Great
Britain. However, Britain could not
enter any Continental system which
tended to separate her from her part-
ners in the Commonwealth. Even
looked at from the standpoint of
purely European interests, it would be
a disaster if Britain, in seeking to
create a new union in Europe, were
in any wise to weaken the union of
British nations which is already an
established reality and which, together
with the United States, constitutes
the only proven bulwark of peace and
freedom.”

Radio Jackpots. —Critics of Aus-
tralian radio programmes on which
all manner of expensive items may be
“won” for answering fatuous ques-
tions may see a glimmer of hops in
the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission’s attack on similar ses-
sions in America. According to N. Y.
“Times,” the commission was tem-
porarily stalled by the repeal of a
section of the Communications Act
prohibiting such programmes, hut it
has since been pointed out that a sec-
tion of the criminal code covers both
lotteries and “give-away” programmes.

Chinese Puzzle. —Harold K. Mills
reports in Washington “Post” that fol-
lowing a football match through the

would be easier than covering the
Chinese civil war. “At the football

though dim and distant without
doubt there is less first-hand report-
ing of the war in China than of any
other conflict in modern times....ln
two years of daily coverage of the
war this correspondent has been able
to accompany Government troops
into the field twice those brief and
closely-conducted visits to the ‘front
lines’ were more than many other
newsmen have had.”

Churchill Foresaw Berlin. —Another
star can be added to Winston
Churchill’s very starry prophet’s
mantle: at Yalta, says a Washington
correspondent of hi. Y. “Daily News,”
he foresaw exactly what has happened
in Berlin when it was made the Four-
Power headquarters with no clear-cut
corridors for the Western Powers to
reach their zones. He tried to stop it
and wanted the new capital for occu-
pied Germany to be a small border
town between the Eastern and West-
ern zones. Roosevelt agreed with
Churchill. But neither pushed this
point far enough—and again Stalin
got what he wanted.”

R.A.F. Enlistments. —According to
Lord Douglas of Kirtleside in the
House of Lgrds, the R.A.F. is in
much the same pickle as the R.A.A.F.
in the matter of enlistments: “Steps
to stimulate recruiting are necessary
in the case of the R.A.F., whose re-
turns are the least satisfactory of the
three services. Unless urgent steps
are taken to improve the rate of re-
cruiting it looks as if the R.A.F. will
before long die on its feet.”

grandson was born in quite another
country —I am not clear what, but I
believe the Irish Free State. They
were both born in Dublin. Can any-
body make either of them a foreigner?
And, if anybody can, what about my
own future status, a native of Lon-
don, and yours, Sir, incriminated by
the broken promise of Hengist and

rightful name of Ludd’s Dun, should
ever be handed back to the tribe of

“Nothing Controversial.” —N. Y.
“Times” has added another interest-
ing feather to the changing plumage
of Australia’s Minister for Foreign
Affairs. Commenting on the Com-
munist heckling at a London U.N.
meeting of Warren R. Austin, per-
manent U.S. delegate to U.N., the
N. Y. paper’s correspondent added
the incidental information that “Dr.
Herbert V. Evatt, president of the
General Assembly, the third principal
speaker, had a good hearing, no doubt
because he was an Australian and
said nothing controversial.”

COAL AND ROYALTIES.
Last week’s sudden and simultaneous
collapse of the Communist-ordered strikes
on the coalfields and the waterfronts, and
of the bread strike in Victoria, accentu-
ated by the near-Red Melbourne Trades,
Hall’s declaring all bread “black,” was
a phenomenon too remarkable to be
attributed to the mere “unpopularity” of
the stoppages. The public has too often
suffered and condemned these minority-
made afflictions for that consideration to
have weighed in the balance with the pro-
fessional troublemakers in key unions.
Nor was the “firmness” of Socialist
Ministers in Canberra and Sydney—that
further phenomenon—something attri-
butable to courageous statesmanship
hitherto concealed like a light under a
bushel. Consider, for instance, Mr.
Baddeley of the McGirr Ministry in
N.S.W., who, having once been a miner,
believes that the best course in dealing
with a coal strike is to do nothing ; what
turned him this time into an enraged
sheep? What broke down Mr. Chifley’s
imperturbable conviction that to invoke
the penalties of the law against the Red
wreckers is • unthinkable, as “crucifying
the workers”? What was it sent the
“Fixer” into a flat spin, and put an
Acting Federal Attorney-General into
battle-dress which the nominal Attorney-
General has persistently refused to wear?
What made the Reds believe that these
always-sympathetic “Labor” Govern-
ments were really going to hit back this
time, and that someone in “the move-
ment” would be badly hurt?
The answer is not hard to find. The
Royal Family are due to arrive in Aus-
tralia on April 4 next and will be in
Australia for 68 days. No “philosophy”
about Communism could blind Mr.
Chifley to the destruction awaiting him
and his party from the electors if the
Royal visit should become a flop for
want of coal denied by the miners’ bosses.
This N.S.W- coal strike was launched
at the very time when, if coal is to be
available next April and May, adequate
reserves must be built up in advance.
There can be no question that the entire
Socialist outfit in Canberra and Sydney,
having made themselves responsible for
getting coal, became badly frightened.
The high insurance premiums lately
quoted against cancellation of the Royal
visit are explicable only partly by fears
of international war, and could be justi-
fied quite as much by a breakdown of
coal supplies through industrial war in
Australia.
Already strikes this year have caused
a loss of some two million tons of coal,
300,000 tons more to date than last year
(which was bad enough), and the Coal
Board’s target of 13 million tons for the
12 months is far out of range. Even if
all miners worked for every hour, “back
Saturdays” included, till their Christmas
holidays begin, they could not repair that
loss —they could not even produce enough
to be able to take their three weeks’
holidays at the year’s end without leaving
a serious shortage for the whole period
between now and mid-January, On last
year’s experience, the public will have
to suffer semi-starvation in coal for the
first weeks after the miners’ return from
those holidays. The. indiscipline among
individual miners, any one of whom can
at will lay a whole mine idle, has been
for far too long encouraged by the
malignity of Communist bosses and the
stupidity of political “Labor,” for easy
correction to be expected now. Where,
then, can any assurance of coal output
be sought?
It has been estimated that from a
quarter to half a million extra people
will come into Sydney during the Royal
visit. Similar mass migration is to be
expected in each of the State capitals
and the big country towns. The demands
thereby falling on transport services, fuel,
light, and catering for the festivities, and
the need to meet normal household and
industrial requirements besides, will be
such that extraordinary stocks of coal will
have to be accumulated in each State
well before the Royal visitors arrive.
That will entail unusual efforts in rail
and shipping movements of coal as well
as the getting of it by the miners, and
the job will have to be done in February
and March.
The miners’ and watersiders’ attitude,
as demonstrated by the strikes, shook
the Chifley and McGirr Cabinets to their
very roots. No wonder the leaders
sprang to unwonted action. If they had
not they would soon have had two
courses presented to them—either to
cancel the invitation to their Majesties
to visit Australia knowing that the tour
must collapse, or to resign rather than
face that dire event. In either case they
would be, by electoral reckoning, dead
meat. Better that the rebels and their
Communist-bosses should suffer a little
“crucifying” than that political “Labor”
should be thus outed,
“Fixer” Ashley said to the northern
miners two months ago, “A continuance
of coal shortages could mean the end of
‘Labor’ Governments and the end of the
Coal Board.” This is how.
No doubt Commissar Williams, of the
Miners’ Federation, and Commissar
Healy, of the watersiders, appreciated
from the outset the consequences of their
intended strikes. The mental distress
which they personally would suffer if the
King’s visit were busted by an Australia-
wide coal famine would probably be
rather less than that inflicted on them
by any previous strike they have engin-
eered. Indeed, the knowledge that threat
of direct action by their unions for the
King’s visit could be used to blackmail
the Chifley-McGim must have counted
with them as the joker in the sort of
deals they practise.
, What they did not include in their full
reckoning is the feverish desire of each
unit of Australian womankind in full
possession of her feminine faculties—
miner’s wife, wharfie’s wife, caucus mem-
ber’s wife, or boss’s wife —to see the
Queen and Princess Margaret as often as
possible and certainly in her own home
town. Mr. Baddeley stumbled across the
truth when force of opinion in his mining
constituency obliged him to ask Mr.
Chifley publicly why the arrangements
for the Royal visit did not allow a longer
halt on the northern coalfields. That
sentiment among the women is the thing
that really killed Ministerial apathy, and
will slay the Socialist Governments, too,
as soon as the public realises that the
Royal tour is probably marred already.
The behavior of the miners during the
next few weeks should clear up any un-
certainties on that point.
After ordering the coal strike six days
previously—having taken as an endorse-
ment of their policy a vote of two to
one among less than a quarter of their
union’s membership—the Communist
bosses on Monday night of last week
ordered all mines back to work. South
Coast and all, without taking any vote
at all or holding any lodge meetings.
There could be no more damning indict-
ment of union administration, especially
when the stoppage was ordered in exer-
cise of power politics against another
union.
In precisely the same way the Com-
munist executive of the watersiders called
off the week-old hold-up of ships in
Sydney Harbor (43 were by that time
idle), and sent the men back to work
under the award at six to each sling in
the ships’ holds, instead of the eight for
which they were prepared to defy arbitra-
tion and the Chifley Government alike.
So, too, the ships’ painters and dockers,
for six weeks idle throughout Australia
against a ruling award, were peremptorily
instructed “by combined waterside
unions” to return to work on conditions
against which the strike managers had
but a week earlier been wailing in simu-
lated indignation to high Heaven, In
Melbourne the Trades Hell had just de-
clared bread “black,” which would have
dragged in a lot of unions other than
the two whose dispute had kept the
quarrel going for a month ; whereon the
Victorian Government informed the local
Trades Hall bosses that it would apply
the Essential Services Act, and the Trades
Hall promptly reclassified bread as white
and the strike as black.
The time has gone by when the public
could shrug its shoulders and wait for the
day of the general election when it could
pronounce judgment. What it might
profitably ask without more delay is why
this Communist plot fizzled out so
suddenly when earlier this year it
had to run a nine-weeks fever-course
in Queensland ; and why, if “Labor” poli-
ticians can at need stop in full course a
strike deadly to the community, they have
never till now found the means or the will
to do so. And, if they have found the
means and the will, why should these
ravages on Australian industry and
society be allowed to occur at all?
The Chifleyites thought they had
pulled off a great party stroke when they
arranged the Royal visit for election year.
It looks now as though—for the mass of
Australians, who have had enough of the
silly flirtation of their Government with
class-war-crazed union bosses—they had
builded better than they knew.
Federation's "Fathers.”
[W. A. Brennan, who lived through the for-
mative period of Federation —he was in the
gallery for the “Argus” when the first Federal
Parliament met —looks, with special interest, to
the recent Life of Edmund Barton, by John
Reynolds.]
There was no “Father of Federation” in
Australia. It evolved inevitably out of
the grant of self-government to the
various The much-abused
Colonial Office foresaw the inconvenience
that would arise from conflict of
authority,, and throughout our early
history the desirability of having a central
Government for common purposes was
referred to repeatedly.
Let us dismiss this notion of a paternal
benefactor, bestowing Federation on his
children* and discount the homage paid
to leaders who were pushed by public
opinion before they led. Were I forced
to measure the immeasurable, I would
credit Alfred Deakin with being the
strongest separate influence. Without
him, it is possible that Federation would
not have come in our day. That cannot
be suggested of anyone else.
Barton acquired significance as an
Australian after the sag in the Federal
movement which followed the 1891 Con-
vention, The draft Constitution for
which Samuel Griffith has been given the
principal credit is more than an outline
of the present Constitution. It is its
foundation, and the amendments made
later, though important, rose naturally
out of the democratic evolution.
Of the factors at that stage the his-
torian, limited to records and to corres-
pondence, will miss much. Probably the
files of The Bulletin would better repay
reading than the empty archives of the
day. In those files lies the concentrated
spirit ,of the Federal fight. Journalism,
in the writing of James Edmond, and of
J. F. Archibald (as I believe) and in the
drawings of “Hop” (Livingstone Hop-
kins), was at its best. The governing
factor to which all else was subservient
was that N.S.W. was necessary to any
Federation worthy of the name and that
the centre of opposition was in Sydney.
Against that opposition, which rejected
Federation as an attempt by Victoria and
other States to batten on N.S.W., The
Bulletin advanced with fire and sword.
In Victoria, the Federal cause glowed
brightly. Deakin had staked his political
future on it; South Australia, under
Kingston, Downer, Holder, Bray and
others, gave support without stint.* The
great influence of Griffith and Macrossan
prevailed in Queensland. High respecta-
bility, reinforced by the economic isola-
tion which the Victorian protective tariff
created, could be relied upon to carry
•Tasmania. An influx of t’othersiders,
largely from Victoria, .was perceptibly
influencing John Forrest, who, under the
recent grant of constitutional government,
was reluctant to share with anyone his
great domain in West Australia.
Remember always there could be no
Federation without N.S.W. An experi-
ment, Parkes standing out, had been made
with the Federal Council, whose actual
work was sufficient only to inspire in
Parkes a fear that he and would
be left behind. He made one of his
periodical efforts to- regain his leadership,
but the sagacious Duncan Gillies sug-
gested to Parkes that if. N.S.W. wanted
to advance the Federal cause it could
do no better than associate itself with
the Federal Council. Parkes to the last
would take no place but the lead. He
was a hindrance rather than a help to
Federation between 1891 and his death
in ’96. When Parkes moved, New South
Wales moved, and he moved with effect
before ’9l.
Reid entered later, In consequence of
a quarrel with Parkes, not on Federal
matters, but on State leadership. The
veteran was lagging superfluous. “Hop”,
had two boys slinging mud at each other
and a lofty fellow looking down on both
saying, “Well, well! How very small
they look!” Tradition has credited
Parkes with having handed over the
Federal leadership to Barton. Parkes, in
bestowing on Barton a charge not then
in his gift, was striking at Reid, a member
of his political party, while Barton was
in the opposite camp, and had been a
Minister under Dibbs. Barton at that
stage had lost interest in State politics,
except in sb far as State politics were a
necessary part of the Federal movement.
The evidence is strong that Barton was
fired with an ambition to do for N.S.W.
what Deakin had done for Victoria.
Barton and Deakin had worked together
in the ’9l convention. They attracted
each other as assuredly as Reid was poli-
tically repellent to both.
Opportunity opened the door to Reid
in 1894. He held the master key when he
became Premier of N.S.W. with Labor
support and took charge of the Federal
situation at the point to which it had
been brought by the efforts of others.
Led by Barton, a vigorous campaign had
been concentrated on N.S.W. with the
assistance of Federalists in Victoria. The
Corowa Conference was one of the im-
portant events of that interval.
Reid did not fashion the Federal en-
abling legislation. He and his fellow-
Premiers at Hobart, in ’95, employed the
political instrument which came to them
from Corowa. It was Dr. John Quick,
of Bendigo, who put into shape the idea
of the elective convention and the referen-
dum, although Parkes had outlined the
suggestion after the ’9l convention. The
idea had to be made viable by legisla-
tion in the State Parliament. The dexter-
ous taking of occasion by the hand gave
substance to the later claim by Reid that
he had found Federation in the air and
had brought it to earth.
Barton headed the poll in N.S.W. for
the convention. By this time, the Federal
movement had assumed the lead in public
notice, and the various Parliaments were
more or less in its train. In Adelaide, and
later in Sydney and in Melbourne, Barton
attained his full stature as leader, and his
influence was not dependent mainly on
the fact that he represented N.S.W.
The burning crisis of the Federal move-
ment was when, in ’9B, a majority of
voters in N.S.W. favored the bill, although
the statutory requirements of 80,000
affirmative votes was not reached. By a
happy coincidence, an election in the
State Parliament followed closely, and into
that contest Barton entered, all aflame.
It was an unforgettable current of en-
thusiasm that swept Australia when Barton
announced himself for Sydney-King in
opposition to Reid. In the campaign for
the bill, Reid was deemed to have failed
the Federal cause. He pleaded that he
felt bound to explain the defects of the
bill to the electors in whom the decision
rested, although he himself intended to
vote “Yes.” Barton was determined to
apply whip and spur to Reid. His failure
to win the seat counted for nothing;
the challenge was everything. Another
door was immediately opened, and when
the Legislative Assembly met Barton and
Reid were face to face.
But from that moment Reid outpaced
all competitors and all pursuers. He
sought from the other Premiers conces-
sions to make the bill “more acceptable”
to N.S.W., but really to save face.
That done, Barton had no further in-
terest in State politics. Barton’s bio-
grapher could have given proper weight
to that swift and effectual movement by
the,“lazy” leader of the Federal cause.
But for Reid’s ambiguous advocacy,
Federation would have come a year
earlier, and—there was -in this an
irony at which the gods make merry
—he would have received the com-
mission which was given to Lyne as
Premier of the senior State by Lord
Hopetoun, the “first Governor-General,
acting, no doubt, by direction of the
Colonial Office. Lyne, the heavy-footed
anti-Federalist, without sufficient political
balance to revolve on his own axis, was
hopeless. The swelling indignation re-
stored Barton to the place which was his
by conquest, and he had practically
unanimous support in Victoria, as was
shown by the elections to the first Parlia-
ment.
We who saw much of Barton in the
first Federal Parliament had little to
inspire and much to deplore. He had
nothing of importance to do. The
ing of Commonwealth legislation fell od
Deakin, Kingston and Turner. In thd
Senate, a burden almost unshared fell on
R. E. O’Connor, whose great qualities, so
well balanced, would have lifted him to
the highest place, had his selflessness not
weighted him. , fi i
Barton’s strength and weakness cannot
be adequately balanced without an
standing that in 1903 his health was
shattered. The mastery of himself which
he regained earlier than that was for one
in whom nervous sensitiveness underlay a
winning companionableness of the rarest,
and its compensations alternated with
periods of deep depression and even
misery. It was in those days that I saw
the Barton of my broken dreams, and
he exuded dignity and power. Those who
would reduce him to their own level by
playing lightly on his indolence might
well reflect on that struggle and its
triumph.

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Empire's Prince.
All over the Empire, which is to say in
all parts of the world, the main subject
of public interest last week-end was the
birth of a future Prince of Wales.
For weeks the preparations for Princess
Elizabeth’s lying-in made front-page news
in the British and Dominion press. On
the expected date the public interest
allowed no room for error in the medical
bulletins. In catering for that interest
British newspapers omitted hardly a detail
of the most intimate arrangements.
On Friday a French cruiser, entering
Singapore, fired a salute to Malaya, and
Chinese citizens of the City of the Lion
promptly hung out their flags to celebrate
(as they interpreted the gunfire) a Royal
baby in London,
From all over the British realm, and
the United States as well, people “backed
their fancy” for a boy in presents for the
Princess’s child. “Bagfuls of them,” said
one postal-van driver, “and most of them
seem to be from Australia and America.”
Crowds thronged the area before the
Palace gates during Saturday and Sunday,
and on Monday morning bells through-
out the Empire proclaimed at last the
news of the birth of a male heir presump-
tive to the Throne.
The Royal line is thus fortified through
Princess Elizabeth, and the popularity of
herself and the Duke of Edinburgh is now
confirmed on its last and most important
ground.
War Trials in Tokyo.
“Ek Dum” on the Japanese war trials:
After two and a half years the Allied Mili-
tary Tribunal in Tokyo, representative of 11
countries, has given its decisions, in one of the
longest findings ever written.
Seven of the accused have been sentenced
to hanging: General Kenji Doihara, Com-
mander of the Seventh Army at Singapore,
1944-45 ; Koki Hirota, formerly Foreign Minis-
ter; Seishiro Itagaki, a former War Minister
and Seventh Army Commander, 1945; Keitaro
Kimura, C.-in-C. of the Japanese Army in
Burma, 1944; Iwani Matsui, C.-in-C, of the
Central China Army at the time of the capture
of Nanking; Akira Muto, Chief of Staff in the
Philippines; Hideki Tojo, Prime Minister.
Most of these are old men, two of them 70
years of age, and the rest, with one exception, in
their sixties. Sixteen others, including one 81
years of age, have been sentenced to life im-
prisonment. Shinegori Togo, one-time Foreign
Minister and a former Minister to Russia, re-
ceived 20 years’ imprisonment, and Mamoru
Shigemitsu, once Ambassador to Britain, who
had always been regarded as friendly to a
peaceful policy towards the English-speaking
nations, was given seven years, principally be-
cause he tried to conceal atrocities from the
Allied Powers.
For the fate of those who were sentenced to
death there can be little repining, though one
of the accused might be a little bewildered at
the fact that though he was charged and con-
demned for the much-advertised “rape of Nan-
king,” that well-known atrocity did not even
lead most of the Powers whose Judges were
involved in the trial to withdraw their Am-
bassadors from Tokyo at the time or even to
protest to the Japanese Government. All
moreover, might be a little astonished to be
sentenced to death by a president who hails
from a State which long ago abolished the
death penalty with his concurrence, and from
a Commonwealth which hasn’t even a law of
treason operating whereby it can punish its own
citizens for crimes against its crown and loyalty.
As in «the Cousens case, the Commonwealth
has to help a State to prosecute when treason
is involved.
To the seven who were awarded death
were sheeted home, first, responsibility
for the foulest atrocities against Australians,
Americans and British in the Philippines,
Borneo, Siam, on the Burma Railway and
elsewhere, apart from the insane murdering
of crews of merchant and naval ships and of
nurses and other non-combatants. The only
regrettable feature about the trials of these
human horrors is that they were so prolonged
and that they were not tried by drum-head
courtmartial and hanged out of hand in their
proper atmosphere quickly and ignominiously,
as Yamashita and others were brought to
justice.
Some other features of the findings are not
so free of material for misgiving. The citing
as criminal actions of Japan’s failure to observe
the Geneva Conventions and of plotting aggres-
sion against Soviet Russia has its grimly humor-
ous side, since the Soviet Union itself has con-
sistently flouted the Geneva Conventions, which
it refused to recognise, its atrocities in Eastern
Europe (of which some members of the higher
Command in Allied Japan were personal wit-
nesses in Vienna and elsewhere) being on a
par with those for which the Japanese criminals
have been sentenced. The U.S.S.R.’s plans for
aggression are well* known, and it would be
possible, on trial, to convict that country’s
rulers of most of the crimes of which the
Japanese have been convicted.
Also, it would be more salutary to secure
convictions like those registered at Tokyo before
the event of war rather than after it, and the
fact that it cannot be done as a matter of
practical politics highlights the weakness of
the new system of international justice.
There were several dissensions connected with
the trials which have not added to their dignity
or effectiveness. A fortnight before the find-
mgs were made, one American defence counsel
was suspended _ for criticising the tribunal’s
procedure, and in the findings themselves there
were differences among the Judges.
Mr. Justice Webb, Australia’s representative,
to whom the members of the Court conceded
unanimously the thankless task of the chairman-
ship, has declared that he regrets that the
Emperor Hirohito—-who, on the evidence, was
n °t the decision to make war until a
month after it was taken by the Japanese War
STi-niT f l n t tned ‘. Bis unfortunate that
this opinion follows closely that shouted by
Mr. Haylen and advocated vigorously by Dr.
Evatt, facts which, impartial as Sir William is
held to be, may lay his viewpoint open to a
political construction.
It moreover seems fantastic in view of the
fact that Allied representatives in Tokyo, except
those of Russia and Australia, associate with
Court circles, attend functions organised by the
Court and imbibe the Royal sake with enthu-
siasm and the best of goodwill.
Even more unfortunate than this is the find-
ing of Mr. Justice Pal, the Indian Judge of the
Court, appointed while the British were still
in control of India, English educated and of the
highest judicial reputation. He declared:
I would hold that each and every one of
the accused must be found not guilty of
each and every one'of the charges in the
indictment, and should be acquitted of all
the charges.
In Asia, whatever its validity, his word will
carry more weight than that of all the other
Judges put together and will lend color in
Japanese eyes to the guilty Tojo’s remark that
the trial was a “trial by conquerors.”
The finding of the French Judge, M. Bernard,
acquitting the accused but advocating the trial
of the Emperor, piles confusion on confusion.
It seems that, in future, the winners might
profitably limit their trials to those of persons
against whom specific charges of actual breaches
of the laws of war are likely to be provable.
The weakness of the Allied position in the
present and other trials in which the plotting
of aggression is the crime imputed is that when
the aggression was plotted there was no law
against it and nobody had any warning that
he would be tried if he were an aggressor.
In fact, one ally, now party to the trials and
convictions of both Germans and Japanese, in
1940-41 was actually aiding and abetting aggres-
sion against the British, French and Americans
and, so far from discouraging the aggression and
atrocities of the Japanese, was helping to feed
and fuel their armies at the time the war
crimes for which convictions have now been
registered were being committed. It remained
in that position until the eve of Japan’s defeat.
General MacArthur will consult the members
of the Allied Council about the fate of the
prisoners on November 22.
The Longest Way Home.
Having forsworn an article in their
political faith by applying to the Privy
Council for leave to appeal from a High
Court majority decision against them.
Socialist Ministers at Canberra are
pluming themselves on their “victory” in
REDEESTR-R-RIBUTION.
obtaining the Privy Council’s approval.
If politics in this land were not so
dour, this would be the best joke since
the Devil surreptitiously cooled his brow
at a stoup of holy water.
In accordance with the win-tie-or-
wrangle doctrine which serves with them
for principle, this Canberra crowd was
quite as ready—and might have been
better pleased —to receive a refusal of
leave to appeal as the cue for wailing
about being thwarted in their party
policy by Tory influences in Britain.
They would have howled for prompt
implementation of the “Labor” platform,
“as approved at the general elections,”
for abolition of all appeals whatever to
the Privy Council.
Reflection will convince the trading
banks, the States and the people whose
cause as a free democracy the respon-
dents in this appeal are upholding that
the preliminary decision of the Privy
Council is on their side. Apart from
preserving the-Australian people’s right
to carry a plaint to the highest legal
tribunal in the Empire, even at the risk
of transgressing against a limiting pro-
vision in their own Constitution, the
decision serves their immediate need
against a revolutionary-minded oligarchy,
by making for precious delay.
Delay is still of vital importance in
defeating the Socialist plans—delay until
the whole issue can be resolved by the
electors at the ballot-box.
Theirs is the proper tribunal for settle-
ment of this question; it is the only
tribunal which really can settle it; and
it is the one to which Mr. Chifley re-
fuses to refer it because he dare not.
Every week of delay gained brings him
nearer to the day when he will no longer
be able to prevent the Australian people
from pronouncing upon it.
Even the technical point on which
leave could have been refused —the ques-
tion whether Section 74 of the Consti-
tution does not put the Commonwealth
Government out of court —has not been
decided but is reserved for argument
when the appeal begins. If it should
appear that, in his concern to eliminate
delays—and in this instance threats at
the Bar will not avail him anything—Dr.
Evatt should discover that the shortest
way round is the longest way home, that
will make another good laugh.
The longest way home is just about
what he will soon be looking* for.
The Sacred Cause.
Invited by somebody or other to assume
control - of all senior football in Vic-
toria, where senior football is big busi-
ness, the Acting Premier answered that
the Government had enough to do with-
out becoming “sports promoters.”
No such qualms disturb the N.S.W.
Government, which already runs a turf
club and a lottery, seems incapable of
keeping its fingers out of racing, supports
what its Acting Premier has called “that
good and useful sport dog racing,” and
has now decided to permit night trotting
(with betting), set up a board to control
dog racing and force the Australian
Jockey Club to let the public in on
appeals by jockeys, trainers, owners and
so forth against A.J.C. racing decisions.
The new bill means that, in addition
to the five or six ordinary and “special”
lotteries a fortnight, Sydney is to have
one horse meeting, one dog meeting and
near to one trotting meeting a week. It
is no wonder that persons who get a
living from these “sports” now proudly
refer to them as “industries,” though they
produce nothing and contribute heavily
to the shortage of labor.
The 92 dog. and trot meetings to be
held in Sydney each year will be night
shows, each drawing heavily on an electri-
city system which now fails to meet the
needs of real industry, commerce or the
household.
Any Government worthy of the name
would be appalled by the spread and
extent of gambling in the community;
the Sydney Government is plainly bent
on encouraging it.
Stupidity of Socialism.
Restoration of political self-government
for Germany, steadily proceeding in the
zones occupied by the Western Allies, in-
evitably entails a decision on the future
of the Ruhr; and now the British and
American Governments are about '‘to
return to German owners” the Ruhr coal
and steel industries, the ultimate “pattern”
of ownership to be left to a freely-elected
German Government-
This pattern will not be allowed to
admit “an excessive concentration of
power”; and the Allies’ preference
appears to be for. the grouping of the
industries into a number of firms under
control of trustees.
The ban on “excessive concentration
of power” would appear to rule out
nationalisation for the Ruhr, and anyway
the U.S. Goverriment has declared against
nationalisation.
That being so, it seems that the
Socialist Government in Britain, having
nationalised British coalmines, and now
obstinately intent on nationalising all
British steelworks, does not propose to
extend to revived German heavy industry
the handicaps devised on private enter-
prise in Britain.
Two considerations thereupon arise.
One is that in the view, of the Socialist
Government under Mr. Attlee the most
efficacious course for restoring a country's
national production is not nationalised
control but encouragement of private
enterprise. The other is that the said
Attlee Government is restoring German
private enterprise as the trading com-
petitor of a nationalised British steel in-
dustry in world markets,
British “Labor’s” policy supplies one
more illustration of the truth that
Socialist theory is mad, and that those
who attempt to translate the- theory into
democratic practice ought to be firmly
restrained. As ex-Senator A. J. Mc-
Lachlan (of S.A.) writes in his recently-
published autobiography, McLachlari an
F.A.Q. Australian (Lothian):
The Labor party has no logical political
outlook short of Communism you social-
ise this and you socialise that, and what
benefit accrues is quite beyond comprehen-
sion. There is less revenue, there is less
income upon which to levy those charges
which enable the Government to provide
the wherewithal for those who do not
work. There is no logical resting place
for Labor short of Communism. Commun-
ism may savor of the autocrat, of the gov-
ernment by thp few, of the elevation of the
few to places of power and authority, hut
at all events it does govern. Labor en-
gages in anaemic platitudes and promises
which can be fulfilled only by avoiding
further State Socialism.
That is exactly what Socialists in Britain
and Australia are beginning to find out.
They are already on the defensive.
Passing of Country Towns.
When the 1947 census proved what,
thoughtful people already knew —that the
drift to the cities was increasing—some
nervous excitement was apparent among
those who took it as a threat to the food
supply of the big cities.
There’s no need for alarm on that ac-
count. Though it’s true some cow-
farmers have chucked the game in and
some banana-benders sold out-to get in
on the suburban key-racket, food pro-
duction hasn’t fallen insofar as supply-
ing local demand is concerned. Food for
export is a different matter, but that’s
political rather than national. Improved
land-production methods, both through
farm technique and modern machinery,
have more than offset the loss of agri-
cultural labor.
What Australians should concern them-
selves with is the stagnation and decline
of country towns which has been going
on for 30 years. By far the great
majority of Australian non-metropolitan
towns have either lost or only just
managed to retain their people. This
can have only one end: a final phase in
which everybody except the farmer lives in
one or other of half a dozen big cities.
Already it is evident that big popula-
tion centres expose their people to politi-
cal and industrial blackmail. When coal-
miners, wharf-laborers or railwaymen
strike today it is nothing less than an
ultimatum to the city population: “Un-
less we get what we want you go without
work, food, light, transport and power.”
Nearly 8,000,000 people scattered all
over the continent, in provincial cities,
towns and villages couldn’t be held up
like that. Concentrated in two or three
spots, they are easy game for the party
politician, the revolutionary and the
criminal.
We have become so much the slaves of
government that the most ardent decen-
tralisers expect the Governments to do
something about repopulatipg the non-
metropolitan districts. One of them said,
the other day:
Secondary industries and people can only
be established and retained in the country
if those areas are given adequate water,
electricity, transport and civilised amenities.
But, in their way. Governments have
“given” these amenities. Dams, long pipe-
lines, electric-grid systems, roads, bathing-
pools, libraries, sewage, telephones—Aus-
tralian country districts, scattered over a
vast area, have these things to as great,
if not greater, extent than comparable
communities in other parts of the world.
The comparative primitiveness of many
parts of rural U.S.A., for instance, would
shock Australians,
Of course, Governments could do much
more; but despite considerable achieve-
ments in providing country districts with
these “amenities,” the drift goes on. What
for instance does Ballarat or Bendigo
lack? Yet their population is static.
Cowra, one of the most delightful towns
in N.S.W., has “amenities,” yet Cowra is
static. So are dozens of other places with
the same “amenities.”
Rightly or wrongly we are an urban
people with a pronounced gregarious
instinct. To such a people the magnet
of the great capital cities is irresistible.
If we could discover vast new goldfields,
or oilwells, or a river of diamonds, or if
millions of immigrants began to pour into
Australia as they poured into America
last century, the problem would solve it-
self, Since no such miracles can be ex-
pected the only people who can "develop
the country centres are the people who
live in them. And, truth’to tell, few of
them seem to have the will to go about it.

The appeal of Dr. Evatt and the
Russian-nominated secretary of U.N.0.,
Mr. Trygve Lie, to Britain, the United
States, France and Russia to confer to
settle the Berlin blockade dispute will not
please anybody but the Russians nor add
to the proposers’ reputations as realists.
Neither apparently has heard that- the
four Powers conferred for weeks in Mos-
cow earlier in the year and came to an
agreement which the local Russian com-
mand in Berlin at once repudiated. Apart
from that anybody who has heard the
proceedings of U.N.0., and particularly
those of the Russian delegates, in the
past few weeks and who thinks the ques-
tion can be settled by further discussion
under the aegis of that rickety body is a
case for examination by an alienist.
Although tfie preferences of the Com-
munist candidate were still to be dis-
tributed, “Labor” on Sunday night write-
off the Geelong seat in the Victorian
Assembly as lost to the Liberals. At that
stage, with only a few postal votes out-
standing the count was: Montgomery
(Lib.), 9654; Travers (Lab.), 8766 ;
Baker (Com.), 1042. A year ago Mrs.
Brownbill, whose death was the occasion,
for Saturday’s by-election, retained the
seat for “Labor” with 11,852 votes against
8623 polled by Montgomery; at the pre-
vious election she had been returned un-
opposed. Geelong has been held by
“Labor” for 30 years, except for one
break in the early 1930’5, and even allow-
ing for the undoubtedly strong personal
following of Mrs. Brownbill it is clear
that the swing against the party, which
swept the Cain Government from office
last year, is still in evidence. Mr.
Chifley’s comforting belief that the public
has a short memory seems due for
reconsideration. Daddy Dedman, who
“assisted” the “Labor” candidate, will
need to do some serious thinking about
his future; in 1946 he held Corio by a
comfortable margin, but redistribution
has taken away some of his safest sub-
divisions and the new Corio isn’t much
more than Geelong.
With the coal-strike over and the show-
down with the Communists once more
postponed N. S. Wales Assembly was able
to shelve its threatened drastic measures
last week and turn its attention to legisla-
tion nearer and dearer to the heart of
“Labor”—a bill to amend the Gaming
and Betting Act. Charges of pulling,
doping and otherwise interfering with an
honest racehorse in the course of per-
forming its duty to the punters will in
future be heard in public; night-trotting
will be permitted, with bookies in full
cry, and a greyhound control-board will
be set up. To one Caucus spokesman the
bill is “a very sincere attempt by the
Government to put greyhound-racing on
a solid footing” ; another feels that he has
“achieved something for the racing
people.” Caucus as a whole probably
considers that, with the exception of the
Salaries Grab and Members’ Pensions, the
bill is the most important piece of legisla-
tion introduced since McKell established
the Sydney Turf Club in 1942.
Now that industrial peace is tem-
porarily restored and there need be no
appearance of either Government’s hand
being forced in emergency, why should
not both Chifley and McGirr proceed to
legislate for (1) a compulsory secret ballot
to be held by the Arbitration Court or its
substitute before any union executive shall
recommend a strike and (2) the freezing
of an offending union’s funds to follow
automatically the deregistration of a
union on cause shown? And if Chifley
and McGirr refuse, will the Liberal and
Country parties undertake, if returned to
power, to legislate for this reform of in-
dustrial indiscipline, and if not, why not?
Heard on the air last week. Donal’
Grant, complaining to his fellow-Senators
of unfavored treatment at the hands of
the press: “Last nicht I spoke in this
Hoose for twenta meenuts and this morn-

Interjector: “There was no interpreter in
the House.”
■ A “secret document” disturbance hit
Queensland Parliament last week when
Aikens, the Mundingburra Independent,
alleged thatWlorris, the Enoggera Kewpie,
had threatened him with the police for
“having possessed a confidential Q.P.P.
leaflet.” The leaflet was a list of sug-
gested contributions to Kewpie funds, but
nobody uttered the famous formula: “If
it is not true it was forged; if it is true
it was stolen.”
Hardly had that noise died down when
Aikens was at Morris again, this time
alleging that he had laid a wreath at the
Shrine of Remembrance on behalf of
the Q.P.P. and that it was “mean and
most contemptible” to bring party politics
into the memory of the war dead. Oppo-
sition-leader Nicklin said Morris, a
former Federal president of the Rats of
Tobruk Association, had officially repre-
sented the Opposition. It ended with
Aikens calling Morris “low” and Morris
returning the compliment and refusing
to withdraw, whereupon the Tobruk Rat
was suspended for a week and Q.P.P.
members walked out with him in protest;
Mundingburra must be proud .of Aikens.
Surest proof of the importance of the

N.S.W. Minister for Agriculture
Graham, announcing that 400,000 gallons
of petrol would be made available this
month for shifting early wheat from farm
to siding, said he would investigate any
hold-up in transport of wheat to rail-
heads. Oughtn’t he find out what holds
it up between railheads and ships?
It seems high time Mr. Chifley, as
leader of his party, kept an eye on
Senator Cameron or that the Senator, as
P.M.G. and czar-designate of the radio-
waves, kept an ear on Chif. While the
P.M., forgetting under stress of office the
“Labor” doctrine he cut his teeth on,
goes on the air to urge the workers to
greater production the P.M.G., who can't
or won’t forget, leaps into print to preach
the opposite policy. Recently the old boy
wrote in the “Australian Worker”:
Workers have nothing to gain and
everything to lose by increasing produc-
tion beyond what would be necessary to
maintain themselves and their families
Increasing strike action, however, by
workers nowadays in most countries of the
world would indicate that the dangers of
producing surpluses is being realised
Coalminers, for example, have few, if any,
illusions about the matter.
Leaving the coalminers’ illusions out of
it and without raising any question about
the shortage of telephones, the fact that
the P.M.G. can suggest that overproduc-
tion exists anywhere in the world today
shows that he still lives in the world of
illusion he spun around himself when he
was secretary of the Victorian Socialist
party.
“Eddie Ward’s speech” has become one
of the stock jokes of the House, which
doesn’t find much to laugh at these days.
Most members know it off by heart, and
Archie Cameron recently offered to say it
for him. But the East Sydney oracle sur-
passed himself last month when he de-
livered the harangue twice inside a week
—on October *1 and again on October 5.
There was possibly a reason, though. On
the first occasion he got the call round
about lunch-time; for the repeat per-
formance he rose at 9.5 p.m., a very good
broadcasting time.
A fortnight ago watersiders unloading
asbestos from a ship in Sydney walked
off the job when their claim for two extra
men to a sling was refused. As has be-
come customary with these petty disputes
the trouble spread until 43 vessels were
held up and work in the port of Sydney
was brought almost to a standstill. The
miners’ strike collapsed and the wharfies
went back to work on pre-strike terms.
There may be no connection between the
two facts, but both unions take their
orders from Marx House.
When N.S.W. sawmillers announced
that unless they got more for their timber
and some help in shifting stacked timber
from forest sites they would close their
mills, the McGirr Minister for Conserva-
tion sprang forward;
The Government will not submit to any
threat involving hardship to employees
and the hold-up of materials essential to a
home-hungry public.
That is, of course, unless the threat is
, made by some Commo union boss or
other.
It appears that Calwell or Chifley or
O’Flaherty or whoever ultimately drags
the “Manila girls” back to Australia has
no intention of making them stay here.
The P.M. told a (questioner that “on their
return to Australia they would be eligible
for passport facilities in exactly the same
way as any other Australian resident if
they wished to proceed abroad.” Then
why on earth bring ’em back?
N. S. Wales Full Court last Thursday
dismissed the appeal of Max Falstein
against his conviction on isix charges
under the Customs Act. A special
Federal Court had fined the M.H.R. for
Watson £320, with £55 costs, on charges
of having, through his agent, presenting
documents which purported to be genuine
invoices, but which were not genuine and
of making false entries in respect of
imported watches. Falstein appealed on
21 grounds, the chief one being that
there was no evidence to support the
alleged authority of the agent Preston.
The Chief Justice found that
there was ample evidence to justify the
magistrate’s finding that Preston was law-
fully authorised by Falstein to do what he
did; there was plenty of evidence that
Falstein was the owner of the goods; and
there was nothing to suggest that Falstein
was prejudiced in his defence by the absence
of further details of the matters with which
he was charged.
The two other Justices concurring, Fal-
stein was ordered to pay the costs of the
appeal. He will nojy appeal to the High
Court.
Vic. Premier Hollway and Opposition-
Leader Cain were together in New York
when news of the latest N.S.W. coal strike
reached them. Neither would be drawn
on the “rights or wrongs” of the strike,
but Hollway told a reporter that he and
Cain were there to see what American
machines could do with brown coal. “Mr.
Cain and I are investigating this together
so that we can form a bipartisan policy.
Even should the Victorian Government
change hands brown-coal development
will go on. The sooner we become inde-
pendent of N.S.W. coal the better.’
That’s enough to cause another strike.
In the matter of making recommenda-
tions to the King on the choice of a
Governor-General, New Zealand’s Labor
Government suffers from none of the in-
hibitions shown by one Federal Minister
on the occasion of a lesser appointment
—“no bloody generals.” Lieutenant-
General Sir Bernard Frey berg, at present
having a look around this side of the
Tasman, has been a fighter all his life.
At 22 he was scrapping in Mexico under
Pancho Villa; at 24 he was in Antwerp
with the Royal Naval Division. A year
later he swam ashore at Gallipoli pushing
a raft of flares to distract attention from
the beach where an actual landing was
to be made. This brought him a D. 5.0.,
and before the Kaiser’s War was over he
had added two bars to that distinction,
won the V.C. at Ancre, had been nine
times wounded, six times mentioned in
dispatches and was a brigadier-general at
27. In the Second War Freyberg led the
Maoriland forces in North Africa.
Greece, Crete (he commanded the British
and Greek forces during the Battle of
Crete) and Italy. Knighted in 1942,
he became Governor-General of New
Zealand three years ago.
“S. M. Herald” reported that the
N.S.W. State Brickworks had increased
its prices “for the fifth time this year,”
remarked that “its bricks now sell at the
same figure as those from private yards,”
and drew the conclusion that “State instru-
mentalities are no more successful than
anyone else in escaping the inexorable
upward pressure of costs.” When Mr.
Cahill’s attention was drawn to the item
he admitted that it was “substantially
correct,” but he regretted “the manner
in which it was made public.” His ex-
planation of the increases was that they
arose “from higher prices for coal and
higher wages and also to the incidence of
the 40-hour week”—in other words the
inexorable upward pressure to which
“Granny” referred, and which became in-
evitable the day when Cahill’s chief, for
political purposes, beat the gun and
brought in the 40-hour week in N.S.W.
while the Federal Arbitration Court was
still considering it.
In the course of his comments on the
Brickworks Cahill told the Assembly that
“the Government was seriously consider-
ing whether, in view of increased adver-
tising rates in the ‘S. M. Herald,’ it
would make other arrangements for pub-
licising its announcements.” What’s that
got to do with the price of bricks?
Old Digger W. F. Sheahan, N.S.W.
Minister for Lands and one of the few
known specimens of a “Labor” man with
guts, made it clear to Young Digger Bate
in the N.S.W. Assembly that he believes
in compulsory secret ballots for unions.
Bate had asked whether it was a fact that
Sheahan had consistently advocated the
ballots for five years, yet failed to support
them in a division in the House.
If these are facts, can he now make a
statement to the House which will recon-
cile his utterances with his action, or will
he new leave public life and go for ever
into the oblivion from which he should
never have emerged?
With his impish grin Sheahan made
answer; —■
I propose to educate public opinion as
far as possible and to ask the majority of
citizens and my party to come to my way
of thinking, and I hope to be the precursor
of the new millennium.
No politician with a sense of humor
merits oblivion.
In giving judgment for a horse-trainer
who claimed fees and expenses from a
company-director and horse-owner who
alleged that a bookmaker was the man
really liable for the debt Judge Holt, in
the Sydney District Court, said that he
was “forced to the conclusion that none
of these three witnesses was reliable,
either as to veracity or memory.” His
Honor did not give any indication as to
whether he thought the bookie’s veracity,
or memory, or both or neither was at
fault when in reply to questions he said
that it was “absurd” to suggest that he
and Senator Ashley were partners in own-
ing the horse Flying Duke, but that the
Senator was “definitely” a great friend
of his.
When this went to the printer Mel-
bourne was without gas through a light-
ning strike turned on by employees of
the Metropolitan Gas Company over the
dismissal of one of their number. The
trouble was settled on Sunday, but the
Victorian Government seems determined
to avoid a repetition. It has announced
its intention of proclaiming the Essential
Services Act, which has been kept on ice
since the transport tie-up which led to
its enactment. The Act prohibits strikes
in essential services unless approved by
a majority of persons concerned —
approval to be sought by secret ballot.
It also prohibits picketing and provides
for penalties up to £lOOO for breaches
by union officials. Earlier in the week a
threat to proclaim the Act had settled
the bread-strike; the gas stoppage was
apparently the last straw.

“K.”: Re swearing and official efforts
to control it (B. 3/11 /’4B), there might
be added to the comment that under
English law the Profane Oaths Act of
1745 makes cursing and swearing, if done
profanely, criminal offences. Fines are
prescribed thus:
Every day laborer, common soldier,
common sailor, and common seaman, Is.;
every other person under the degree of a
gentleman, 25.; and every person of or
above the degree of a gentleman, ss.
And that, as a case in 1864 showed,
means Is., 25., or ss. for each swear-
word uttered (so long as it is profane).
The law came up for revision by the
House of Commons last July when it
appeared in the schedule to a Statute
Law Revision Bill along with 770 other
“obsolete” statutes, the list founded on
report of a select committee, which from
time to time reviews the Statute Book
to cut out deadwood. But this Profane
Oaths Act was not repealed. It was,
however, amended. Hitherto, under its
provisions, a policeman, charged with fail-
ing to arrest cursors and swearers, could
be fined 40s. or have some of his furni-
ture sold to bring in the same amount, or
be sent to the workhouse for a month.
By amendment last July, a constable so
complained against by “one or more
credible witnesses,” and found guilty,
may be required to do a month not in a
workhouse, but in prison. That done the
old Act was sent forth with a new lease
of life.

was “to keep your balance.” The news-

som and paid 4s, to be - driven to Spencer-
street, carrying my mate’s and my own
ticket and his clobber in a Gladstone-bag.
He failed to turn up. The train went via
Geelong and put us out at Ballarat about
8 a.m. on a bitter day. I struck an
English girl on the train, her cobber
hadn’t turned up, or so she said, and we
did the “picnic” together. But she had
the unfortunate newchum habit of decry-
ing things Australian, and when she
sneered at the “Flight from Pompeii” in
the gardens, waxed sarcastic over the
steamer trip on Lake Wendourie, and
alleged that the pie I bought her was
stale, I took her into the little Art Gallery
and left her there. About an hour later,
well on towards train time, I was drink-
ing rum in the Scottish hotel and suddenly
remembered I had her ticket for safe-
keeping, The picnic fare was a cheap
one, 7s. 6d. return, whereas the single
second-class fare to Melbourne was then

hadn’t more than five bob, so rushed
down to the station, handed in the ticket
and told them to watch out for her. I
waited till the last train, but didn’t sight
her. Perhaps she’s still waiting in the

rak, a “suburb” half a mile to the north-

tion. The local Noah is Tom McGrath,
an 82-year-old -identity who heads a sec-
tion which proposes to move the town
back to a forlorn-looking railway-siding
known as Brolga. Whatever happens, one
thing is certain, that the final evacuation

Sydney-Emden battle was the reminder given
by Admiral Collins at the Melbourne Lord
Mayor’s banquet that the date was the 34th
anniversary of Captain Glossop’s sinking of
the raider, which, the Admiral said, was as
important to the R.A.N. as Gallipoli was to
the A.I.F. After passing the first Australian
convoy at a short distance without knowing
of its existence, Von Mueller made for the
Cocos atoll to demolish the wireless and cables.
The Chinese cook of the cable-station, out in
the early morning looking for shellfish, was
the first to sight the Emden’s dummy funnels.
She had long been expected, and a signal
promptly went out from the wireless, which was
picked up by the Australian escort and
brought the Sydney to the scene a few hours
later. In the meantime the Emden’s landing-
party was busily engaged blowing-up cable
equipment, uprooting the wireless mast, loot-
ing the cable stores, cutting the cable shore-
ends and fraternising with the staff, which was
smiling up its sleeve. Later Britishers and
Germans, seated on the roof of the quarters,
had a grandstand view of the destruction of the
raider, which ended its days on the reef at
Horsbrough Island. By the time the Sydney
returned from the engagement the landing-
party, under Lieutenant von Miigge, having
pinched Governor Ross’s schooner, Ayesha,
had sailed out of the lagoon like picturesque
pirates and were hull down on the horizon.
After sinking and capturing more Allied ship-
ping they landed at Aden in a tramp, crossed
Arabia by camel and got a tumultuous recep-
tion in Berlin. The cable staff dug up out of
the sand spare instruments, batteries and equip-
ment, joined the two ends of the Cocos-Perth
cable across the gunwale of a moored boat
and in 24 hours were talking to Australia and
London. The Cocos-Perth cable was the only
one the Germans really severed. The cables
they labored at so energetically were short
lengths which had been laid out to sea in order
to deceive just such a raider.

“Eureka”: It is well known that many
men work in factories at week-ends or on
night-shifts using assumed names to
dodge the wage-tax. At a Sydney box-
factory the boss called out the name of
one of these casuals about a dozen times,
but got no response. Finally he com-
plained, “I wish you chaps’d remember
the names you work under.”
* * * *
“Squid Shay”: When I was in Japan
shortly after World War One, the pro-
fusion of inquiries in foreign lingoes
overwhelmed the stationmaster’s office at
the central railway-station'in Tokyo. He
slammed up a large blackboard at the
approach to the platform, with a placard
telling foreigners to use it for making
inquiries about people they were seeking
—non-arrivals, non-starters and so forth.
One day I found this doleful plaint:
“At one I come. But you are not. So
Igo myself home.” I remember another
chalk episode in a French town where I
once abode. A little girl down the alley
got hold of some chalk and made a mess
of the walls. Bublic opinion arose in its
wrath and menaced her with horrible
punishments. Next day I caught her at
it again. I remonstrated. “Oh, that’s all
right, Monsieur,” she assured me. “I’m
only chalking up 30 times T must not
chalk words on the walls, signed Anne-
Louise.’ ”

“Derwent”: Tasmania claiijis another
“First in Australia.” Launceston taxis
are to be installed with radio telephones,
enabling contact to be made from a main
control station with any of the fleet of
cars. It will also be possible for cars
to contact one another. A frequency-
modulation service with a range of be-
tween 20 and 30 miles is being used. A
big saving in mileage is expected, and the
taxi-phone should also be useful in dis-
covering whether the passenger still has
time to catch his train or plane, in the
last-minute dash!
# * * ♦
“Nakhoda”: I see that a Judge in Syd-
ney has enunciated that it is “nonsense”
to say that smoking is a luxury. If it
isn’t a luxury, what is it? It cannot be a
necessity; millions of people don’t in-
dulge in it, and it was unknown to the
ancient Greeks, who did pretty well with-
out it, though, no doubt, they had other
forms of solace. Like beer, self-pity and
Communism, it is a form of solace for
mankind’s unhappy feelings of inade-
quacy. Art, literature and music might
also be called forms of solace, but
Whistler showed the distinction when he
saw a pupil standing in front of his
easel filling a pipe. “Don’t paint,” he
said. “Your pipe may go out.”
* * * *
“K.V.”: The two women deployed
their bulky frames comfortably on the
seat in the suburban train and launched
into a loud discussion of their family
affairs. From there, by way of general
topics, they worked around to the cur-
rent sensation —the escape of a mental
patient. One admitted to being “scared
stiff,” but her friend reassured her that
there was nothing to fear. If one met
the wildest of wild men it was only neces-
sary to humor him. Directly in front
of the pair a languid-looking young man
was gazing out of the window. At this
stage he drew a book from his pocket
and held it up to read. One of the
talkers glanced over his shoulder, halted
in her narrative and looked significantly
at her companion, who also took a peek.
They exchanged a ““do-you-see-what-I-
see” look and subsided into uneasy silence
until the next station, where they got out.
The languid-looking young man then
flipped the book right-side up and com-
menced reading.
* * * *
“Filar”: In a back street of my suburb
a motherly old soul conducts a “mixed.”
At the end of the counter, nearest the
display window, ds a set of plain glass-
topped barrel scales. With beans at Is.
per pound the old girl takes a cardboard
box to the window, places beans in it,
and weighs them, box and all. I glanced
at the scales where the empty box was left
in the rush; it weighed Hoz., so the
proprietress is lib. beans up on every tenth
customer. The local foreign gentleman
in the same line of business is much more
subtlfe. The scoop of his scales contains
at least 2oz. of soil which just happens to
get there —and somehow manages to re-
main—from much spud-weighing. The
fact that the scales are of the registering
type is easily circumvented. Always a
spare potato reposes in the bottom of
the scoop, and, coinciding with the weigh-
ing of each purchase, this stray is lifted
out —a gesture indicating impeccable
honesty of purpose —but is invariably
returned to the scoop again. The couple
of ounces of good red soil always re-
mains, and the presence of the lone spud
accounts for the “registration” on the
scale face.
THESE GALLUP POLLS.
“An Illinois (U.S.) newspaper has announced that
it will publish no more Gallup public-opinion polls.
After these forecasts about the result of the Presi-
dential election proving so utterly and hopelessly
wrong, the public would no longer have any faith
in them.”
These Gallup polls! By widely-voiced consent
They seemed a well-worth-while experiment,
Taking at random a cross-section (sic)
Of what we term the body politic
To find therein a sure and certain clue
To what the crowd in general would do.
A Yank device, it’s something of a shock
To note them getting there so hard a knock,
Wrecked, so to speak, on Presidential shoals,
These Gallup polls!
These Gallup polls may have their use for
showing,
Like weathercocks, which way the wind is
blowing
When thousands or when tens of thousands wait
Their party loyhlties to indicate.
But when it’s millions for whom they’re picked
Successes or frustrations to predict,
They’re fallible as Mother Shipton fans
Or astrologic quacks and charlatans,
As gullible as geese and blind as moles,
These Gallup polls!
Heart up, you chaps with slippery seats, who let
This sort of divination make you fret
And doubt if polling-day won’t queer your pitch
And. leave you, sorely humbled, in the ditch.
No man can estimate, from what a few
May think or say, just what the crowd will do.
Best keep in mind what sturdy Truman did
Those tempests of disparagement amid,
And how he tore to rags and left in holes
These Gallup polls!
Put faith, if your experience insists,
In Government meteorologists,
In the straight bat your timberyard that guards
At cricket, and the ace of trumps at cards;
In short, in everything that’s proven, from
The Darwin theory to the atom bomb.
But now they’re shown so hideously wrong
In the most spacious test that’s come along,
Withdraw your trust, you too-confiding souls,
From Gallup polls!

This early wheel-lock Handbuschse sporting rifle with its ornate
buck-horn stock, shows all the consummate skill of the 17th
Century gunsmith. Although its range was limited, and its
accuracy doubtful, the Handbuschse sporting rifle was among the
finest weapons of its day.
Modern weapons demand high grade ammunition. Sportsmen of
today have a sure guarantee of consistent excellence in all 1.C.1.
sporting ammunition.

“Uramao”; New Zealand doesn’t be-
lieve in rushing things, but unless a new
war upsets the applecart the history of
Enzedders’ part in the Boer War will
be ready for publication in a few months.
Five successive historians, who tackled
the job, either fell down on it or sought
other work, but Mr. Parry, Minister for
Internal Affairs, recently assured a depu-
tation of South African War veterans that
the matter which had been kept steadily
in view by the Government for 45 years
would soon be an accomplished fact.

“L.P.”: The assassination of the Duke
of Buckingham (B. 27/10/’4B) is import-
ant in newspaper history. What is
claimed to be the first newspaper illus-
tration appeared in a journal (news-
books they were then called) of 1627. It
represented a poniard used in the first
attempt on the Duke’s life at Rochelle,
and in a caption it was described as a
“portraiture of the knife with which his
Excellence should have been murdered”
—an idea which might have been better
expressed. The weapon with which
Felton later made the successful attempt
is described in the history-books as a
“tenpenny knife.”

“Zake”: Fashion has decreed that milady
may now carry the latest in detachable-
handle umbrellas in her handbag. This
is a great step forward. That mechanical-
mindedness which has always been so
marked a feature of the feminine make-
up will be greatly strengthened by the
ladies’ frantic endeavors to find out, when
they are caught in a sudden shower out
in the open, which end the handle fits
on, and they should be no more than
soaked *to the foundations by the time
they enlist the aid of a passing man to
solve the problem. Absentmindedly push-
ing the soaking brolly back in its proper
place while animatedly discussing whether
gussets or box-pleats will go better with
a bolero should be excellent for hand-
bag manufacturers. But the most fascin-
ating effect will surely be reserved for
the tram troub as he waits patiently
while the elusive treybit is chased furi-
ously among the folds of the brolly.
“Spinet”: Benzedrine (B. 10/11/’48)?
A clever but brain-weary undergraduate
relied on the drug to see him through his
last exam.-paper. Unstimulated fellow-
students watched with envy as he wrote
confidently until time was up. He came
out assuring well-wishers that he felt
magnificent and had never written a paper
like it. He hadn’t, either —his answers
consisted entirely of his own name,
written with energy for three hours.

“Nozzer”: Teaching sailors to swim
(B. 21 J lO/’48)? When I joined the
R.N. in 1908 I did my training in
H.M.S. Ganges (Shotley Barracks, Har-
wich), and swimming was one of the first
instructions received. Every boy had to
swim 100yds, in the baths and about the
same distance in the river dressed in a
jumper and trousers. Christmas or mid-
summer leave was not granted to any
boy who had not passed out of the
swimming class. A further test was
given in the river before being drafted
to sea-going ships.
* * * *
“Jurumudi”: Years ago I wrote a
piece for The Bulletin concerning the
“Since Maggie left everything in the gardens lousy”
old-time China tea-trade in which I
spoke of “the Roaring Forties and the
no-less clamorous Nineties.” I was
rather pleased with my talents as a
phrase-maker until some inconvenient
scribe, anticipating “Salt Junk Joe,”
pointed out that the Roaring Forties was
a region of the Southern Ocean, not a
period in history.
* * * *
“Cedus”: Origin of the gremlin (B.
3/11/’48)? Odhams Dictionary, pub-
lished in 1946, says “R.A.F. slang, an imp
or goblin alleged [how careful to avoid
the law of libel!] to be responsible for
mysterious faults in, an aeroplane. From
‘goblin’ and ‘fremlin,’ the latter being
the name of a brewer in whose bottles the
imps were supposed to hide.”

“McL.”: Caught with several others
on licensed premises one Sunday after-
noon, Old Bob knew he would have to
put up a pretty good case. His cobbers,
pleading guilty, were fined the usual two
quid and 30s. costs. Old Bob boldly
said “Not Guilty,” and explained. “Your
Worship, I was in the hotel by special
request from the landlord in connection
with a cat.” “A cat?” repeated his Wor-
ship. “Yes, sir. It was a tomcat I
had business with.” “Can you produce
the cat in the court if necessary?” the
Beak asked. This was a bit of a staggerer,
but Bob came back with “No, sir. The
operation wasn’t successful. The cat
passed away.” “Well, well,” said the
magistrate. “Seeing your reputation as
a doctor of cats has suffered, case dis-
missed.”
* * * *
“Swaddy”: Two mainland visitors to
the Hobart Show took yarns of the
midget. size of the Apple State too
literally. The plane crossed Bass Strait,'
reached the Tassie coast and 30 minutes
later alighted at a drome. The two visi-
tors got out and were soon whirled into
town by bus. At the airways office they
asked the way to their lodgings. “It’s
rather a long way,” the clerk told them.
“The hotel you want is in Hobart.” Ob-
serving their blank looks, he added “This
is Launceston.”
* * * ♦
“Eureka”: There is no price control
over souvenirs, as any tourist will dis-
cover. Recently I bought for 2s. 6d. a
plastic letter-opener inscribed “Souvenir
of Katooraba.” The following week a
similar article with “Newcastle” substi-
tuted for “Katoomba” was on sale in
Newcastle for 7s. 6d. “Mountain devils”
sell in Katoomba at fancy prices, yet
they can be picked in hundreds all oyer
the Blue Mountains.
* * ♦ ♦
“Clooter”: My daily paper, telling of
an English boy who borrowed ss. from
his father to enter an angling contest and
won a hatful of prizes, remarked that the
proud father was unlikely to demand
repayment of the loan. It reminds me
of a couple I met at our picnic golf-
course. The man was with me on the
first tee when his wife borrowed 2s.
from him to play the poker-machine.
Before we hit off an excited squeal an-
nounced that she’d hit the jackpot and
she ran out to us with 50s. “Now, go
and put a quid of it on Catsmeat,”
ordered the husband. “And if that wins,
have something on Birdseed,” I put in.
We hit off. As we set out he remarked,
somewhat bitterly, “Y’ know, she didn’t
offer me two bob back.” At the ninth
he mentioned the fact again. There, was
nothing I could say. When we got in
we learned that Catsmcat had won at
eights. Birdseed at sixes, so she was round
about 50 quid up. I struck him in the
guesthouse lounge-room that night.
“What’s it like to have a lucky missus?”
I asked. He didn’t smile. “She never
offered me two bob back,” he growled.
“Y’ know. I’ll never get that ruddy two
bob back.”
* * * *
“F.S.”: There has never been an age
when there has been so much bad art or
so many exhibitions. It is the age of
lectures, exhibitions, concerts, councils
for the advancement of this and that,
committees for bringing art to the people,
the schools, the country and the factory
—and now they are trying to spoil the
kids by holding children’s exhibitions, of
which there have been several lately in
Melbourne. They are solemnly opened
by Lud Mayors, and eminent critics trot
along and discover geniuses. One
wouldn’t be surprised if one of these days
some innocent daub by a girl of three or
some flagrant imitation of Walt Disney
by a more sophisticated youngster is pur-
chased by the Felton Bequest and gets
into the National collection. Still, it
might be as good as some of the recent
acquisitions.

“Hep-2-3-4”; Consternation followed
the discovery that some Bristol Grammar
School Old Boys were wearing versions
of “the tie” colored upside-down. The
haberdasher supplying them was put on
the carpet and guiltily admitted that he
had cut his last lot of cloth “as economi-
cally as possible,” which may have ac-
counted for some of the ties wrongly
signalling red - over - yellow-over-green.
After rashly declaring that he “did not
think it mattered much,” he was led
away amid hisses and uproar. A similar
panic was experienced by at least one
unit during the recent stoush, and a dark
warning appeared on its company notice-
boards ;
Duty officers have observed color-patches
being worn upside-down. This error will
be rectified by OSOOhrs. Monday.
On Monday they turned out to a man
wearing them right-side-up—-the only
offender was the unit flag, which, hoisted
by the R.S.M. himself, fluttered its up-
side-down defiance throughout the whole
parade.
♦ * ♦ ♦
“Percy Pawnticket”; My own non-
successes in the lottery have satisfied me
that Fate has no part hi handing out
the prizes to the most worthy; but it has
certainly managed to play some tricks.
A chap I know, recently married, left to
his wife the buying of a small token for
his dad’s birthday. Not aware of
the old chap’s prejudices, she thought
a lottery-ticket would be just the
thing and posted one. It won a
prize. But the old man, who hates
gambling in all its forms, had torn
up the ticket and refused to have
anything to do with the money. More-
over he announced that the “gross dis-
regard of his principles” had caused him
to alter his wifi. After a lot of argument
the angry old bloke was induced to make
an affidavit about the destruction of the
ticket, and order the payment of the
prize to a society one of whose objec-
tives is the suppression of gambling. But
his son and daughter-in-law are still on
the blacklist.
TEMPERING THE WIND.
“The Federal Cabinet is introducing a Bill to
provide that Senators and Reps, who are defeated
after eight years in Parliament or who retire after
12 years will be entitled to £8 a week for life.”
God tempers (Laurence Sterne asserts) the wind
To the shorn lamb. Though how he claimed
to know it
And stress it so authoritatively
I cannot tell, "there doesn’t seem to me
Much evidence to show it.
Still, it’s a pleasant principle enough
And chances to approve it never cease,
Whether it’s Reps, or Senators who’ve lost
Their seats and been into the discard tossed
Or sheep who’ve lost their fleece.
Blokes who have missed the bus, according to
Those who applaud Sterne’s well-known
apothegm,
Should not their country, now that fickle mobs
Have torn them from remunerative jobs,
Temper the wind to them?
They did their little bit, and now their scope
For further opportunities is past,
The notion worries and the thought repels
Of leaving their defenceless cuticles
Bare to the chilly blast.
Eight quid! It’s more than any member drew
When Federation came upon the scene. One
Could hardly have foreseen that you could
touch,
When Labor got into its stride, as much
For merely having been one.
Some Heavenly power may, for all we know,
Take pity on the shivering lamb’s condition,
But here we’ve earthly rulers come to free
From fear of aught approaching penury
The blown-out politician!

THE SERVICE MAIN
WHITHER JAPAN?
“Ek Dum” (in Japan): At
first glimpse the problems of
Japan seem so simple to visitors
that most who come here
have settled convictions about
them within a week. The whole
countryside looks rich and pros-
perous, even if the villages are
dirty and crowded. The golden
rice is so thickly packed together
that the wind can scarcely wave
the full ears. The people laugh
and sing and attend festivals and
amusements in thousand-thou-
sands. Outside the schools the
baseball-fields are in full play
—except in Hiroshima, where
they play Australian football.
The fruit, bowing the trees with
its weight, lends a splash of
color to villages with steel-grey
roofs. The fishermen and the
salt-makers are at work. All
along the Inland Sea coast little
wooden ships are being built —
largely to go to the Russians by
way of reparations. Textile and
rayon factories, needle factories,
canning factories are coming to
life. In Tokyo, green and nor-
mal despite its hollowed spaces,
there is an opulent atmosphere
of which the U.S. force motor-
cars of 1948-49 models form the
chief ingredient.
In the great 50-mile spread of
industrialised Osaka-Kobe, one
of the greatest aggregations of
population which the world
knows, normally equal to two
and a half times that of Aus-
tralia, is enjoying the sight of
something which much of it has
never seen before —the blue hea-
ven above. Once this God-
given feature of the universe
was perennially hidden by man-
made industrial smoke.
The chimneys which made it
are still there. The factories
which made it often, are not.
They were blown sky-high like
the new buildings along Light-
ning Boulevarde, the pride of
Osaka’s heart. Sometimes their
reinforced skeletons stand, bent
and rusty, acre upon acre, in the
midst of hovel-infested rubbish
which has been spawned over
since it .was created by the fire-
bombs. But even in such places
there is industry, fat children,
busy life which tend to deceive
the casual passerby as to Japan’s
attitude of mind and future.
More and more chimneys are
smoking.
Japan, it is conventionally be-
lieved by pressmen rushing
through and visitors who are
shown by proud local officials
how much can be achieved by
real Western efficiency applied
in an enlightened way to a
docile conquered people, is
doing all right and is grateful
to its conquerors, to whom it
is supposed to give credit for its
recovery.
The future is bright. “De-
mocratised,” Japan will come
through, a credit to her new
makers. Somehow the 60 per
cent, of leeway lost since 1934
will be built up, and, with the
gap filled, stable and an
example, Japan will join the
community of “peace-loving
nations,” and this will be done
without giving Japan the power
to arm —that is, without giving
Japan heavy industry.. She will
be the happy friend of all, and
especially of Australia, which has
done so much to “democratise”
her in southern Honshu and
other adjacent parts, and of this
the witness is to be seen already
in the waving of schoolchildren
every time General Robertson
walks abroad on his tours of
inspection. Those who suggest
mildly that a Japanese child is
not a Japanese adult, and that
children would wave at anything
on a holiday, are treated to a
cold stare.
The Reserve Attitude
Yet it is a matter on which
any reasonable man might feel
noncommittal, for underneath
the general Japanese effusiveness
one begins to detect, after a few
days of • observation, another
attitude which seems more logi-
cal in a proud race living in a
land whose sheer beauty and
fruitfulness are a starter to in-
stinctive patriotism, apart from
its tradition.
It is the attitude of a people
which feels that it is standing on
its own feet, playing up to and
using its occupiers and which
has lost nothing of its own self-
respect through being con-
quered. Its tradition is not de-
stroyed. It refuses to allow
its foreign managers to see it
crestfallen. Its head is “bloody
but unbowed.”
When you travel in the
American G.I, train which runs
all the way from Tokyo to
Kyushu and watch the solid
walls of stony faces, staring,
staring on the railway stations,
which are the only places where
you can really observe the
Japanese people in static masses
and off their guard, you ac-
quire very soon a feeling that
they are not the “reformed
characters” they are supposed to
be, and that you-would not like
them much if they were. You
feel -that if you were a member
of an ancient island race and
you were in the same position
as themselves you would wait
a hundred years to avenge the
shame of defeat. The atmos-
phere is much like that of Ger-
many 25 years ago. ■
It is difficult to understand the
mental processes of observers
like some of our official ones
who have convinced themselves
‘that the Japanese have actually
accepted our own concept that
we are a race superior in culti-
vation of mind and in civilisa-
tion, together with the kind of
sanctions which we exclusively
have imposed on them, such as
non-fraternisation and complete
exclusion from Australian terri-
tory.
More detached onlookers are
compelled to feel that the out-
ward show of*.friendliness is not
the outcome of humility. It is,
as often as not, very genuine
with the individual. It is the
same sort of surprised friendli-
ness which develops in many a
former prisoner-of-war of the
A.I.F. who is here. On each
side there was the fear and hate
of the war years which personal
contact on a more equable basis
has melted. But behind the in-
dividual attitude you sense a
regimentation which is not the
doing of the occupation forces.
There *is a mass patriotism
which is just as capable of being
misdirected as it was in 1941,
and there is an energy, virility
and discipline which is frighten-
ing, and one does not know
whether to be more frightened of
it when applied to peace than to
war.
This “defeated” nation, for
instance, its old leadership
“purged,” still has a native press
of tremendous proportions pour-
ing out daily newspapers in tens
of millions of copies and
weeklies and magazines in stag-
gering numbers and varieties
providing a ready-made propa-
ganda weapon which, though
officially uncensored, the Allied
Command in Tokyo has found
it necessary to strictly “control”
to the point at wjiich many local
newspapermen insist that there is
a de facto censorship, in contra-
vention of avowed policies. It is
essentially and totally Japanese
in outlook, and, though it ob-
serves the directions of the
Supreme Command to the letter,
it is not always scrupulous
about the spirit in' which its
obedience is given.
As for industrial virility, there
are evidences to hand. You find

The Government is making

Honshu by a tunnel which will

that it will be possible for very

“Squeeze” Comes Back
■, , ,
They can be an unruly lot
when they like. Even now the
foreign traders who form the
second line of the occupation
army claim that they are suffer-
mg from squeeze and other
Orientai methods and there is
little doubt that they will have
still more cause to complain in a
few years; or months’ time-
when foreign trade really begins
to become an issue and when the
Japanese have the power to bar-
gain, which they have not at the
present moment
A definitive factor in the sue-
cess of the occupation so far
has been that foreign trade has
been dead and that the Japanese
have not been of any com-
mercial consideration other than
as a receptacle for whatever
goods the occupation authorities
have been prepared to allow to
come in here. But exporting
level has now been reached—
the U.S. is already receiving
quantities of goods, the first silk
of the new era has gone to
Britain, and the British Com-
monwealth trade agreement is at
completion point, with Aus-
tralia a participant in the fore-
front of the arrangement,
though it is the country which
has been keenest in maintaining
non-fraternisation in the occu-
pation areas.
Hitherto, major exports of
other countries, such as wool,
have been readily marketed at
boom prices without recourse to
Japan. Shipping has been so
constricted that, even if there
were really large trade oppor-
tunities, they could not momen-
tarily have been capitalised,
But, given a few years of peace,
this condition of affairs will
change remarkably. Within a
decade or far less Japan may be
an eagerly-sought market de-
manding the right both to ex-
pand and to put herself in a pos-
ture to defend her trade routes
and her coasts and ports,

The Russian policy follows
these lines, only more cautiously,
with emphasis on the right of
trade - union organisation,
especially in key unions, and
with an almost uncompromising
condition about the peace
treaty that it shall be made, not
by all the Allies, but by the four
great Powers,
Two of these, Britain and
America, Moscow hopes to see
divided on the questions of com-
merce and internal industrial or-
ganisation, and the other, China,
it hopes will be by that time in
the hands of its friends the
Chinese' Communists, who will
do its own bidding.
If China is not, the viewpoint
of the present Chinese Govern-
ment, expressed very unofficially,
but, nevertheless, fairly correctly,
by the former Chinese Premier,
Chang - Chan, over Nanking
Radio a few days ago will suit
Stalin and Molotov for the time
being.
The New Prosperity Sphere
Chinese should (said Mr.
Chang) cease criticising and
pointing a censuring finger at
others. They must recognise
that world reconstruction
centred on Asia ; that, in fact,
“following World War II an
Asiatic century already has be-
gun.”
Asia, he continued, was rich
in untapped natural resources
and had a population of
1,000,000,000 living on the
world’s lowest standards. And
he advocated that China should
take the initiative towards
“forming an Asiatic economic
bloc, from which a peaceful and
democratic Japan, needless to
say, would not be excluded.”
Remembering the phraseology
of the Japanese in 1940-41, Mr.
Chang’s scheme sounds very like
a heady project to sub-edit the
words “South-east” out of that
well-known phrase “South-east
Asia Co-prosperity Sphere,”
which crystallised all the reasons
why units of the 34th Brigade,
Australian Military Forces, are
now occupying a camp named
after Ebisu, God of Prosperity,
in the heart of Tokyo.

PERSONAL ITEMS
There has been a strange contrast in
the careers of the two American poets,
T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, who crossed
the Atlantic as young men to conquer
English letters. Pound took up Douglas
Social Credit and Mussolini, was declared
a traitor in the late war by the U.S.
Government for his broadcasts from
Rome and, when the Americans eventu-
ally laid hands on him, was stated to be
insane. Eliot took up the Church of
England and the Monarchy, has just been
awarded a Nobel Prize for literature
(worth £11,000) and is a sitter for the
Laureateship after Masefield.
About 20 years ago a Mudgee youth
sent in some joke-blocks to The
Bulletin. The art editor sent them back
with the suggestion that he should “stick
to concrete-mixing.” The lad didn’t ex-
actly do that, but for a while he stuck
to his office job by day and spent his
evenings playing the trombone and saxo-
phone in a dance-band. A year or so
later he took his trombone on board a
steamer and, with a like-minded friend,
set out to show London what real dance-
music sounded like. London was not
greatly impressed, but one of the comic
papers he had read aS a boy bought
some humorous drawings he turned out
in his spare time. Next step was a job
with a studio that was producing cartoon
films. Then some sketches clicked with
“The Passing Show,” so he left the film,
job,, and, working as a freelance artist,
soon dug himself well in to the London
joke-block field. Hq invaded “Punch”
in 1937, and by 1939 was one of its regu-
lars. Six years in the Royal Artillery
interrupted him a little, but the flow of
ideas and jokes is in full flood again.
On achieving “Punch” he felt that he had
really made the grade and tried to put
his real name on his sketches instead of
the- “Hickey” he had been using, but
“Punch” said, in effect, “No, Hickey you
are, and Hickey you’ll stay.” The full
monicker of the man who refused to stick
to concrete-mixing is George Harvey
Hickson. His father is a Sydney solicitor,
his mother a cousin of Banjo Paterson.
It could safely be said of A. E.
Buchanan, ex-captain R.A.N., who re-
ceived the U.S. Bronze Star Medal in
Melbourne for some smart work
in destroyer Arunta up north, that he has
seen two dreams come true. The first,
the ultimate peak of experience to which
a destroyer commander can aspire,
materialised when he drove Arunta into
a torpedo attack against a Jap battleship
in Surigao Strait. The second was ful-
filled on August 30, 1945; in Tokyo Bay,
when, at the head of 500 bluejackets, he
was the first man after the surrender to
land in Japan from the sea.
“Trinco”: If the Russians start shooting in
Germany, one of the toughest generals in the
U.S. Army will jump into the job of stopping
them, Lt.-General Clarence Huebner was ' a
ranker in 1910, Today, after fighting experience
of both wars, he commands the American Army
forces in Germany, forces which he’s bullied,
toughened and finally disciplined from an easy-
living post-war mob into a small but compact
command of prideful efficiency. His crack
honor guards, with their chromium-plated hel-
mets, white gloves and scarves, enjoy an im-
pressive reputation among Germans, who’ve seen
nothing like them since the days of the Im-
perial Army. His voice permanently husky
from mustard-gas, Huebner told his men:
“Every man of you is primarily a soldier.
You will be trained as such. Some day you
may have to fight for your lives.” Acknow-
ledged as the U.S. Army’s outstanding training
expert, Huebner was a ranker for six years, got
his commission in 1916, and was a company
commander in the Ist Inf. Division when the
Germans launched their first terror raids against
the Americans in the Luneville sector in Novem-
ber, 1917. Next year he was wounded by a shell
which broke his helmet and his neck, but
he came back to continuous action in the great
battles which convulsed the Western Front until
the end of the war. In the second melee he
landed as commander of his old division at
Normandy, and fought it through St. Lo, Mor-
tain, the Falaise pocket and Aachen and the
bloody Hurtgen Forest. Now the same division
is with him in Germany, On V-E Day Huebner
had his men in Czechoslovakia, close to the
Russians, who announced they would move in
on his bridgeheads. The American’s reaction
was typical and immediate: he sent a battalion
of tanks backed with artillery to the threatened
position. That’s all the Russians wanted to
know. Counting restraint a weakness, they
understand a man who knows what he wants
and backs his decisions—and in that respect
General Huebner is about as shy as a 21-gun
salute.
A retired master-mariner named
Sydney Harbor is on his way to Sydney
in the Wairangi. Mr. Harbor is a sailor.
Some years ago Julius Caesar, at one time
employed on Sydney coal hulks, died at
Narrabeen; Oliver Cromwell and John
Dryden have both been on the charge-
sheets of Sydney courts; and William
Shakespeare appeared in a case as a
witness, and said he could neither read
nor write,
“Nanson”: A link with early Wes-
tralian goldmining snapped at Cottesloe
when mining-engineer J. H. Johnson,
known throughout the State as “Ora
Banda Johnson,” passed on at 84. Born
in Maoriland, he reached the goldfields
at the turn of the century, and 10 years
later sank the Gimlet incline-shaft at
Ora Banda, in the eastern fields n.-w. of
Kalgoorlie. From then on there wasn’t
much in the goldmining field he didn't
have an interest in. Himself a great
Empire-man—yellowed records in his
home show his forebears were with Clive
in India and Wolfe at Quebec —his
grandfather, Dr. Grant Johnson, signed
in M.L. on behalf of the British Govern-
ment the Treaty of Waitangi, which
ended the Maori wars. The doctor’s son,
Johnson’s father, was private secretary
and Maori interpreter to Sir George Grey
when he was Governor of N.Z. A long,
lucid letter to the “West Australian” on
the advantages of mining coal under the
long-wall system, as opposed to pillar
extraction, written only, two months be-
fore he died, showed J.H.’s mind was
young to the end.
Subject of Scorfield’s sketch is an old
towney of his, Jimmy Adamson, who-
hails from Newcastle-on-Tyne, where
Scorfield was “Scafe” of the “Evening
Chronicle.” Now chairman of directors
of British Paints, with eight branches in
England and others in India, S. Africa,
Sydney and America, Adamson started
work as a grocer’s errand-boy. The
size of his arms and shoulders is
explained by his story that when he
left the grocer’s shop to sell tallow candles
to sailing-ships his skinflint boss was
obliged to buy a pony and cart to de-
liver the goods which young Adamson
had hauled in a scwt. barrow. At 17
he was mixing paints in his own shop—

Fred Thompson is depicted here by

ments from those finally selected to
migrate. Communists and S.S, guards—
the latter easily identifiable by a brand
of indelible ink under one armpit—are
barred, and each case is examined indi-
vidually. War orphans are traced by a
special department, many of them to
good German homes, and on-the-spot
relief men think they should be left in-
stead of, as required by the French arid
Belgian Governments, being returned to
their own countries, possibly to institu-
tions. Germans themselves are working
well in the U.S. zone, the last harvest was
good, superphosphates are in fair supply,
the potato crop was a* record, and the area
is approaching self-government under
men elected by the Germans and
approved by the U.S. authorities. An
observant man and a good talker, Thomp-
son was an early advertising manager of
2UW, went to Europe in 1935, ran his
own broadcasting station at Lyons, in
France, came home when the war burst
and served in R.A.A.F. Intelligence in
New Guinea and points north. His wife
is still in Badkissingen, and he leaves to
join her next month.
Currently roaming around Sydney and
singing the praises of Lord Howe Island
is Alasdair Loch, whose history reads
like a bad case of itchy feet. Born in
Kalgoorlie and schooled at Shore, in
Sydney, and a branch of Manchester
Uni. in England, he went into the film
business first as an actor and then on the
technical side. After five trips to Holly-
wood to see what went on in those parts,
he took on a couple of expeditions up
the Amazon and one into West Africa.
Knocked back by the R.A.F. because of
jungle fever —he holds an “A” licence —
Loch joined the 8.8. C. as a producer-
writer and then as a war correspondent.
Ordered abroad for two years for medical
reasons, he came back to Australia and
has since made three excellent docu-
mentary films —“City in the Sun,” “7
Woolloomooloo” and “Weekend in the
South Seas,” the last a celluloid report
on Lord Howe Island. His itchy feet
are taking him back to England shortly.
The passing of Tasmanian artist
Charles E. Ritchie evokes memories of
Streeton, Roberts and others of the
Eaglemont school with whom he
sojourned in Paris. Unlike them, he stuck
to Europe and made, a niche for himself
in the more exalted circles as a portraitist
in watercolor. He was commissioned
several times to do portraits for the Royal
Collection at Windsor Castle, including
portraits of the present King when he was
Prince Albert. Ritchie was a Royal
Academy show regular for many years ;
among his best portraits was one of his
friend Tom Roberts.
Here is the best news for employers
since the 40-hour week. The vice-presi-
dent of the B.M.A. has announced that
Professor Frank Burnet, director of the
Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville
(Vic.), is “within measurable distance of
being able to control ’flu,” Burnet has
waged war on germs*since he became a
Beit Fellow of the Lister Institute in
London in 1926. Now a F.R.S., M.D.,
Ph.D. and D.Sc., he also took on Ger-
man measles, and though not in com-
plete rout the wog is no longer able to
harm unborn babes if mothers have the
disease,.
“Fitz”: English playwright Geoffrey Thomas,
at present lecturing on the theatre in Sydney,
is no stranger to these parts. A tall and
amiable fellow with a bright humor, Thomas
first same to Australia, at 24, in 1922, as a
tutor to Geoffrey Harmsworth. He made a
second trip in 1925, stayed five years and
worked in sawmills and shearing-sheds. Born
in Gloucestershire, Thomas went to Worksop
College, and, after serving in the first scrap with
the Somerset Light Infantry, rising from private
to captain, and winning the Croix de Guerre, he
graduated in Science at Edinburgh Uni. It was
not until he was in Mapriland, after his second
visit to Australia, that Thomas began to write.
His first efforts were radio sketches, and in
1936 his first play, “Winter Sunshine,” the
action of which takes place on a ship bound for
Australia, was produced at the Royalty, Lon-
don, with Nicholas Hannen and Athene Seyler
in the leads. He has written five other plays,
including “The Shoemaker’s Last,” “The
Amiable Mrs. Luke” and “Calcutta in the
Morning,” and this year Christopher Johnson,
London, published his first book, The Theatre
Alive, in which he sets out to demonstrate in a
novel fashion that the theatre has always been
a critic of man and his ways. Thomas has lec-
tured in England on the drama for the Arts
Council of Great Britain, and he will talk next
Wednesday evening (Nov. 24) at the N.S.W.
Public Library on Ibsen, and the following
Wednesday fortnight on Shaw, at the same
place. Like most Englishmen his main com-
plaint against Australia is our wretched pubs
and deplorable drinking habits. He sees a great
future for the theatre here, and hopes stimu-
late an interest in the stage, and a demand for
community theatres by taking country audiences
behind the scenes to see comedy, tragedy and
farce from the viewpoints of their creators in a
style of presentation that was successful in Eng-
land.
Jimmy Riddell, farewelled as Mel-
bourne’s city-valuer after 44 years with
the council, was a noted amateur athlete
in his early days. As a member of the
Carlton (Vic.) Harriers, he won the 10-
mile cross-country championship at Caul-
field in 1906, running against Alec Still-
well and George Blake, both champions.
He is the only runner to hold all five
championships—half-mile, mile and three
miles on the track and five and 10 miles
cross-country.
The Last Post has sounded for Lt.-
Col. Frank Peters, an Anzac who was
wounded at Lone Pine. Old Diggers of
the 49th Battalion who trooped across
in the Hororata will remember him as
their o.c. troops. On the Western Front
after the evacuation, he caught another
severe packet in Belgium. After the All
Quiet he travelled for a Melbourne biscuit
firm, and died two days before Remem-
brance Day.
Into the silence:
At Cowes (Vic.), at 81, Rev. T. Worsley
Maguire, Presbyterian minister and engineer.
Born in Manchester, he was apprenticed to an
engineering firm, and jn 1888 brought to Aus-
tralia machines for production of locomotives
at Gawler (S.A.). After four years at Newport
(Vic.) workshops he went to America and took
B.A. degree. Back in Australia, he become in-
cumbent of Beaconsfield Presbyterian Church,
Fremantle, and was an Army chaplain in
World War I.
At Charleston, Scotland, at 87, Major
Reginald Hunter-Blair, brother-in-law and
A.D.C. of Earl Glasgow in 1892, when he was
Governor of Maoriland. Hunter-Blair saw
service with the Gordon Highlanders in the
Eastern Sudan in 1884, was with the Nile Ex-
pedition the next year, had a round against
the Boers in 1899-1902, and was a general staff
officer in the First World War.
At Mentone (Vic.), at 89, Edward J. Rigby,
chairman of directors of Robert Bryce and Co.
He founded the Austral Otis Engineering Co'.,
which made engines for Melbourne cable tram-
ways, some of which are still in use. Before
his death the sole surviving foundation member
of the Victorian Institute of Engineers a*nd a
foundation member of the Institute of Mining
and Metallurgy, he was sent to Russia during
the first war to build large silver-lead works,
but the mission was interrupted by the revolu-
tion. He escaped through Norway # to England.
At Avalon Beach (N.S.W.), Henry Robert
Holmes, formerly Dean of Bathurst. Educated
at Melbourne Uni., he was ordained in 1904,
and after serving at St. Phillip’s, Sydney, for
a year, he was accepted for missionary work in
India, remaining there until 1921 as a chaplain
with the Indian Labor corps. Returning to Aus-
tralia he became Rector of St. Mary’s, West
Maitland, and was Dean of Bathurst when he
retired in 1942.


Women’s Letters
From Sydney
As this is being written the bells in
England are pealing and clashing in a
very ecstasy of rejoicing over the birth
of a son to Princess Elizabeth and the
Duke of Edinburgh. Throughout the
whole of the British Commonwealth the
radio is distilling the sound of glad
chimes. But the bells are ringing only the
changes on a chant royal that is surging
in the hearts of all their Majesties’ loyal
subjects sharing in the happiness of their
daughter.
Maoriland’s famed Governor-General,
Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Freyberg,
VC., and Lady Freyberg are now in
Sydney. They will be given a reception
by Sydney’s Lord Mayor and Lady
Mayoress in the Town Half, tomorrow
afternoon at 4 o’clock.
The Metropolitan Theatre’s new offer-
ing for the Christmas season is the very
old Coventry Nativity Play, and Aria Da
Capo. There is a link here —one tells the
story of Christ’s birth, the other stresses
the brotherhood of man. Aria Da Capo
is the introductory play peopled at begin-
ning and end (when the “Song Began
Afresh”) with Pierrot and Colum-
bine, a carnival table and the bright trap-
pings of make-believe. In between there
is a bit of stark realism which is strong
though unconscious propaganda for
U. It is written by Edna St. Vincent
Millay, and it proved to one person in
the audience that poets and not politicians
should run the world. The blue of Mary’s
robe, the flame-red of Herod’s trappings,
the accoutrements of the three Kings,
and the soft browns of Joseph’s cloak
passed across the small stage—like a
series of charming Christmas-cards in
the Nativity play.
Almost every woman in the crowded
rooms of the Lyceum Club last Thursday
represented at least two decades of work
in the cause of women. The rally was a
farewell with flowers —flowers of speech
as well as garden blooms —to Ruby
Board, who has decided to retire from the
presidency of the N.S.W. National
Council of Women. Ruby, who has held
almost every office in this movement, has
been State president for 10 years. After
each of the afternoon’s speakers (three
minutes each, ladies, please) had added
her tale of some particular job well done
by the retiring president, it seemed there
was no angle of women’s activities, in
peace and war, that had not had Ruby’s
attention.
Speakers included Mrs, J. Metcalfe
(the new president), Evelyn Tildesley,
Miss Vidler, Dr. Grace Cuthbert (who
behind the inadequate screen of her hand-
bag added a delightful feminine touch by
making-up her lips before facing her
public), Mrs. Commissioner James of the
Salvation Army, Mrs. Bernard Muscio,
Mrs. Edmond Gates. There were many
others. But the theme was always to the
glory of Miss Board. Ruby made neat
and brief reply, much touched by the
wave of friendship about her. For tan-
gible gift there was a delicately-flowered
tea-set and a pendant of marquisette.
Gladys Marks, Mrs. W, R. Dovey, Mrs.
Vernon Cole, Persia Porter, of the
V. and dear little Mrs. Darsow, of
miniature-gardens fame, were there.
V.As. in Sydney breathed a deep sigh
of relief when the coalminers went back
to work and industry swung. back to
normal. The reason was dozens and
dozens of spanking new uniforms being
made for the annual parade of the Red
Cross V.A.D. on November 27. This will
be held in the inner Domain at three
o’clock. The Governor of N.S.W., Lieut.-
General Northcott, will inspect detach-
ments and take the salute in the march
past. He will also present the “Wilfred
Johnson” Cup to the most efficient de-
tachment, and King’s Bar brooches to in-
dividual V.As. H.M. the King has
approved this mark of distinction to
recognise active and efficient service. The
brooch is awarded to Voluntary Aids with
a minimum of 10 years’ active service.
Helen Baldock’s bridal raiment of fine
white needlerun lace and tulle billowed
gracefully as, squired by her father, she
entered St. Mark’s at Darling Point last
Wednesday. Helen, younger daughter of
the W. J. Baldocks, had a wedding date
with Gordon Bettington, of Terragong,
Merriwa. Nancy Baldock and Mrs.
Alan Atwill attended the bride in frocks
of pink moire. A reception by the bride’s

Golf Club.
Did Kenneth McKenna feel like a
dove of Peace as he flew by Pan
American to Australia? Kenneth’s big
job is to openln Sydney a United Nations
public-information office, serving Aus-
tralia and Maoriland, and that’s about the
modern equivalent of the olive branch
the dove of old brought to Noah. Mr.
McKenna and his wife arrived last Friday
evening, and were met by a great con-
course at the airport. Mrs. McKenna
was a Perth girl, and during the early
war days was active in war services in
Melbourne. While her husband was
with U.N.O. in New York, Mrs. Mc-
Kenna helped in the good work. She
was attached to the Australian News and
Information department.
They left New York on the third-hottest
day of its history, and it took them two
days in the Mauretania, going to England
to cool off. London is still Mrs. Mc-
Kenna’s greatest thrill, though Paris,
with its fountains, its boulevardes and
its art treasures, is a song to remember.
There was a Schiaparelli show for her and
a very plush reception at the Foreign
Office, and a dazzling gala night at the
opera, when the two Australians were the
guests of the French Government.
This brilliant girl is Daphne Davison, of
Palm Beach, who recently won, from
Sydney University, a Science scholarship
to Cambridge, where she will continue her
studies in Plant Biochemistry with the
famed Professor Chibnall. Leguminous
vegetables are Daphne’s particular study;
green peas and suchlike. But her interest
in them is purely academic. She will keep
a lynx eye on them with regard to meta-
bolism, This Australian student will stay
amid the medieval atmosphere and the
giant rhododendrons of Cambridge for
about two years. She is working towards
her Ph.D. Norton Trevaire photograph.
If goodwill and warm wishes make a
fair tide then Harold Blair shall make
port in the greatest opera houses and
concert halls of the world. This young
aborigine singer with the fabulous tenor
was greeted with storms of applause when
he sang in the Town Hall with the
Symphony Orchestra directed bjT Joseph
Post. Whoever has taught this singer can
feel proud of the job he has done in two
years. His diction in the Handel numbers
was perfection, and the voice itself was
like a silver trumpet in the Judas Mac-
cabaeus aria “Sound an Alarm!” The
Town Hall was crowded, and amid the
thousands was a small .group of young
aborigine girls dressed in white. Excited
concertgoers crowded around and
cheered as Mr. Blair left the hall. Con-
ductor Joseph Post was openly delighted
at the singer’s success.
Do you recall Annie in “Annie Get
Your Gun” shooting a seabird, bringing
it down to the deck of her ship and say-
ing “Here, boy, ask the chef to make me
a sandwich”? Well, at a recent barbecue
in Sam Lands’s gardens, Evie Hayes
hadn’t to do anything so drastic. She was
waiting meekly in a queue for a hot-dog
when a small boy whooped out “It’s
Annie!” and going to her armed her
proudly to the hot-dog stall right on the
side where the chef was dealing them out.
Impressed by the escort the chef handed
out two hot-dogs, Evie Hayes told this
story at the Australian - American
Women’s lunch at the Savarin last week.
Evie looked a peach in silk crepes
splashed with mauve-blue flowers. Her
hat was Leghorn with a shady brim edged
with mauve-blue velvet.
President Florence Taylor’s speech
glinted with sentiment and humor. Be-
sides the popular actress she introduced
Dr. Lloyd Ring Coleman. This gentle-
man seems to be a kind of modern slant
on Diogenes. He is obsessed with the
idea of the tub. But his tub is fitted up
with electricity so that it becomes a wash-
ing-machine. If he can only get his com-
pany for the Exploitation .of Russia
going, he proposes to sell this gadget to
the housewife now washing her clothes
the old hard way in the Volga, the
Dnieper and the Don. Behind the non-
sense there was the sound commonsense
of “let us all be neighbors.”
From Melbourne
At the Victoria League’s Empire Ball
at St. Kilda Town Hall a gold-framed,
red-velvet-draped picture of the King and
Queen hung on the wall behind the
official table. A big Union Jack waved
in a stage setting of gum-trees and ferns,
and the massed bowls of red, white and
blue flowers carried out the Empire motif.
Silver candelabra holding red candles,
silver bowls of lily-of-the-valley and
masses of rhododendrons, gladioli, blue
iris and red roses decorated the tables.
Lady Dugan, who is president of the
League in this State, wore a striking gown
of blue and silver brocade. She was re-
ceived by the president of the ball com-
mittee, Lady Knox, in a pale-lilac and
silver gown. Mrs. Guy Bakewell, the
League’s senior vice-president, wore a
black gown splashed with groupings of
brilliant flowers and a white ermine
shoulder cape. Lady Herring’s gown was
of filmy black Chantilly lace. Mrs. Leigh
Falkiner was in grey satin. Mrs. lan
Connell added a black lace mantilla to her
white satin gown. The skirt of Mrs.
Edmund Alcock’s grey chiffons featured
graduated flounces edged with white lace.
Mrs. R. Coldham and Mrs, Dick Noone
championed the slipper satin with an
off-the-shoulder effect. Kathleen Hughes,
leader of the Young Contingent of the
Victoria League, combined black lace and
taffeta in her gown.
Miss Meysie Law, whose work with the
Y.W.C.A. has taken her half round the
world, was guest-of-honor at a buffet
luncheon in the Conibere Hall, Guests
included representatives of women’s and
community organisations; among them
were Mrs. Karl Kumm, president of the
national Y.W.C.A.; the president of the
Y.W.C.A., Mr. C. Caffey, and Mrs.
Caffey; the general-secretary of the
national Y.W.C.A., Mr. J. T. Massey, and
Mrs. Massey. Guests were.received by
the president of the Melbourne Y.W.C.A.,
Mrs, T. C. Rentoul. Other guests in-
cluded Mesdames R. G. Casey, Essington
Lewis and H. P. Wright. Mrs. Casey and
Miss Law are old friends, for they met in
India. Miss Law spoke of some of her
experiences in that country. She is now
the general-secretary of the Y.W.C.A. in
this city.
Northcote is represented in the Miss
Australia Quest by attractive 23-year-old
Margaret Woolford, who is sponsored by
the Opportunity Clubs. She holds a
pilot’s licence with 33 hours’ solo flying
and was a student of philosophy at Bris-
bane University. A year ago Margaret
sailed on the 60ft. yacht Viking to Suva,
where she was production secretary for
the J. Arthur Rank film “The Blue
Lagoon.” After five months in that job
she returned to Melbourne. John Warlow

Brilliant sunshine gave racegoers at the
Melbourne Racing Club’s Williamstown
Cup meeting at FJemington the long-
hoped-for chance to get out of tweeds,
topcoats and the heavier suits. Mrs. W. P.
Mein, wife of the chairman of the M.R.C.,
wore a black jacket-suit which had a
pleated skirt. A fine black lace blouse and
a natural-straw hat trimmed with loops of
black velvet were tasteful accessories.
Her daughter, Mrs. A. Stuart, gave a
sporting touch to her navy jacket-suit
with a white straw navy-taffeta-trimmed
beret. A tan wool suit and large tan
straw hat lined with white grosgrain made
harmonious blending for Mrs. G. R.
Nicholas. Lady Blarney’s black silk frock
had a collar of gold crepe which matched
the gold stitched hat with its trimming of
gold tulle. An off-white tailored suit was
worn by Mrs. Norman Robinson with a
small white boater banded in London tan.
Mrs. W, McDermott’s black silk tailored
coat featured the nipped-in waistline and
full skirt; her hat was a black picture-
model .trimmed with pink tulle. Mrs. V.
Cornaga’s linen suit was blue, her up-
turned Breton sailor hat white. The
large Leghorn hat trimmed with tartan
ribbon worn by Mrs. Harold Herbert
caught the eye. Mrs. Leslie Stuart’s
grey tailored suit had for company a
beret of grey and beige velvet spiked
with grey quill. The large “Roof of
Paris” hat in black coarse straw worn
by Mrs. T. G. Jones carried two large
pearl hatpins. Her daughter Betty’s black
dressmaker-suit and small hat trimmed
with gay spring flowers made neat com-
bination.
At the final meeting for the Fashion
Fantasy committee the president, Mrs.
Garnet Carroll, announced that £l6OO
profit had been made, and this was
handed over to Lady Angliss for the
United Nations Appeal. The success was
the result of much hard work and plan-
ning by the committee and the generous
response of all those who attended the
Fantasy held last month at the Princess
Theatre. After the meeting Mrs. Garnet
Carroll entertained members of the com-
mittee at afternoon tea at Russell Collins’.
The hostess’s Parma violet jacket-suit had
as accessories blouse and hat in pale-
mauve tonings. Mrs. Olive Thring teamed
brown suit and ostrich-feather-trimmed
hat. Mrs, Philip Dare’s tailored grey
tweeds were topped with a large black
straw hat which flew a ruffle of black
taffeta. Mrs. Alec Finlay’s suit was black,
her small hat trimmed with bows of aqua-
blue taffeta. Mrs. Ron Decker, wife of
the hon. treasurer, wore a navy jacket-
suit and matching hat Pat Christie’s
winter-white suit was worn with a match-
ing hat banded in London tan.
Douglas Cox and his clever designer.
Dotty Laughlin, showed women journalists
enough to foretell that gull-grey, club-
brown (cocoa mixed with a dash of
purple) primrose, Shetland-blue, winter-
white. gold, grey, cherry-pink and gos-
samer-blue will be the rage this season.
There are to be two coat silhouettes ; one
with almost tent-like proportions, with
the fullness falling from the shoulders ;
the other featuring the nipped-in waist-
line and skirt fullness. Variations on
these two themes include buttons, belts,
hoods, the shawl and cape shoulders and
detachable scarves. The businessgirl is
catered for with well-cut frocks ; many
of them showing ciickey fronts of checked
gingham or white sharkskin. Afternoon
frocks are of wool crepes, angoras and
romaines. One evening gown emphasised
the strapless, decollete neckline ; the per-
fectly straight front from which all full-
ness was drawn to the back under an
outsize bustle,
Gertrude Johnson, back from Sydney
and bursting with enthusiasm over the re-
ception she received for her plans of a
State-theatre movement, hostessed a late-
afternoon party at the National Theatre.
Sir Robert Knox, president of the
National Theatre, was host. Purpose of
the party was to give guests an oppor-
tunity of meeting the young singers who
will appear in the forthcoming National
Theatre Opera season. Gertrude pinned
red roses in her light royal-blue frock, and
matched them with the roses in her large
straw hat. Prof. Heinze added his quota
to the speeches; he was accompanied by
Mrs. Heinze, whose black tailored coat
was worn with a small grey hat trimmed
with violets, Mrs. H. Pacini combined
wide-brimmed black felt hat, black frock
and hip-length grey Persian-lamb coat.
Mrs. Horace Stevens’s hat, flowered in
mauve and pink, was worn with a black
ensemble.
The Lort Smith Hospital, which is
sponsored by the Animal Welfare League
of Victoria, has rendered splendid service
over the years. During 1947 over 11,000
animals received attention, and as the
hospital operates for animals belonging
to people not in a position to pay full
veterinary fees, moneys received are not
nearly sufficient to .meet the growing
demands for its upkeep. There is an
ambulance section as well as an X-ray
clinic to support, and to assist the funds
Mrs. Louis Nelken and a large com-
mittee have arranged a Garden Fete, to
be held at the home of Mrs. lan Miller,
Glenferrie-road, Toorak, on December 4.
If country readers want to help Mrs,
Nelken they may send gifts to the South
Yarra Railway Station, where they will be
collected. Donations may be sent to Mrs.
Louis Nelken, Cloyne, 609 Toorak-road,

Mr. and Mrs. Frank O’Collins gave a
late-afternoon party at their Frankston
home to welcome back from England
daughter Moira and her husband, Dr.
Jim Peters, who had been doing post-
graduate work and gained his F.R.C.S.
Mrs. O’Collins received her guests in a
black faille jacket-suit. Moira allied black
taffeta ballerina skirt and white Swiss-
embroidered blouse. Mrs. Harry Furnell
wore a muted printed silk frock and black
hat. Mrs. John O’Driscoll’s jacket-suit
was navy, her white straw hat trimmed
with navy ribbon and red and blue
rosettes. A trio of pretty girls at the party
were Joan Silk, Pam Dixon and Beverley
Buxton. Mrs. John .Collins matched her
black frock with a small rose-trimmed
black hat. Mrs. John McHarg’s jacket-
suit was of soft aqua-blue wool. A silver-
fox bolero added the chic touch to Moira
Shelton’s black frock.

This enterprising 12-year-old paper-
making venture, which technically and
financially has put up a satisfactory per-
formance, has a big programme of ex-
pansion in hand. Its mills at Burnie (Tas.)
turn out fine-printing, writing and type-
writing papers that compare favorably
with, and are now selling considerably
cheaper than, similar imported lines.
Demand continues to run well ahead of
output, which increased slightly last term.
The contraction of £17,321 in net earn-
ings was due to the small lift in controlled
selling prices failing to offset the steep
rise in costs, and to heavier allowance
for depreciation (£186,345, up £79,707).
The £83,492 of profit was 5.2 p.c. on the
£1,600,000 of capital on which divs. were
paid, compared with 6.3, 6.6, 6.3 and
8.3 p.c. back to 1944. The div., steady at
6 p.c. since 1941, called for £12,508 mote
profit than claimed, leaving £129,819 of
capital unrepresented by tangibles in the
books at end April.
To bring output more into line with
demand the parent is enlarging its pulp
mill and installing two new paper-making
machines —No.. 3, which will lift output
by about one-third, is nearing completion,
and No. 4 is on order for delivery at end
1949. Also the wholly-owned subsidiary,
Paper Makers Pty. (issued capital
£1,344,526), operating near by, is pushing
ahead with erection of its 10,000-ton-p.a,
hard-pressed fibre-board plant and saw-
mill, and development of its 184,000-acre
forest area. To help meet the outlay in
connection with all this, the parent issued
1,600,000 new £1 shares at par in Aug.,
1947. These new shares do not rank for
dividend until end Oct., 1949. At end
April last £651,455 of the money had been
gathered, leaving £948,545 still to come.
When the lot is received, paid capital will
be £3,200,000, on which 6 p.c. will call for
£192,000, and there will be a lot of new
assets at work to help swell earnings.
The next table shows what was done
with the £651,455 of new capital, together
with an extra £384,243 of outside money:

doubtful whether the large holding of
cash, etc., will be sufficient to meet outlay
on the programme in hand.
Since the close of accounts activities
have been widened by formation of a
new co., Thomas Owen (Aust.), Ltd., to
make parchments, greaseproof, glassine
and other specialty papers at Burnie.
Formed in conjunction with Thomas
Owen and Co., Ltd., which makes similar
products at Cardiff (Wales), the new co.
will kick off with an issued capital of
£1,750,000 in 750,000 4\ p.c. cum. prefs.
and the balance ords. The prefs. (under-
written) are now offered for public sub-
scription at par, A.P.P.’s shareholders
being entitled to prior allotment of half
of them. The ords. are to be taken one
half by A.P.P. for cash, and the other
half, credited as paid to 16s. each in part
consideration for plant, by Thomas Owen
and Co., Ltd. —the remaining 4s. a share
is to be paid in cash within four years.
No goodwill figures in the deal. No
estimate of profit is given, but there are
sound reasons to believe that, the venture
should give a satisfactory account of itself
when it gets into its stride. Production
is scheduled to begin in about three years.
In association with the new co. and
with British Coated Board and Paper
Mills (a Welsh associate of Thomas Owen
and Co., Ltd.), A.P.P. has also become
interested in another venture, Ballarat
Paper Mills Pty., which is to make coated
papers at Ballarat (Vic.), where land and
buildings have been bought from the
Federal Government for £184,000. Issued
capital' of this Ballarat co. is to be
£500,000 in 200,000 prefs. and 300,000
ords., of which the participating cos. will
take 100,000 each. Terms of the pref.
issue are to be announced shortly.
Anticipating its benefits the market
prices A.P.P.’s f.-p. pound shares at
365. 3d., giving an immediate return of
3.3 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis. Including
uncalled capital, the cover is 19s. 2d. in
net tangibles.

Higher mining, treatment, transport,
smelting and other costs, together with
lower tonnage of ore milled, more than
offset the gains from higher metal prices
and sale of 15,925 tons zinc concentrates
produced some years ago. After adjust-
ing 1947 figures for War-time (Co.) Tax,
the slip in profit claimed in the p. and 1.
account last term was £152,934:

Average prices for the year to June 30
actually realised by the co. for lead and
silver were £BO 12s. sd. (up £l4 18s. Id.)
a ton and 4s. lOd. (down 3d.) an ounce
respectively. The average figure for zinc
is not mentioned, but it rose, too, though
less steeply. Prices realised are below
export parity, because lead and zinc in
the Australian market, which must be
supplied before export is permitted, are
still pegged at £22 a ton for each metal.
This is a parasitic price, far below current
cost of production, and on these two
grounds alone calls for prompt adjust-
ment. The equivalent in Australian cur-
rency of the current London price of
lead and zinc is £l4O and £ll5 respec-
tively.

and development) shot up 355. 2d., reach-
ing £5 14s. Bd. a ton of crude ore. Con-
tributing factors were (1) higher lead
bonus to employees, (2) initial contribu-
tion of £lOO,OOO to a liberal pensions fund
for B.H. mine employees, (3) heavier
expenditure on development (£304,000,
up £96,000), and (4) lower tonnage
treated.
The lead bonus averaged £8 os. 6d.
per week per employee, and called for
£398,746, equal to 335. lOd. per ton of
ore mined. Including the bonus, the
average wage per man on full-time em-
ployment was £941 (up £123) p.a., approx.
£lB 2s, per week. The lead bonus is
now over £lO per week per employee,
and other costs are still rising, too.
As for the mine, at June 30 ore re-
serves were conservatively estimated at
1,885,000 tons (down 60,000 tons over
the year), or a little over six years’ work
on extraction of 300,000 tons annually.
But higher metal prices have extended the
limits of pay-ore, and the old section
of the mine is being re-equipped for ex-
traction of both sulphides (lower levels)
and oxides (upper levels), and the driving
of a new transport level to No. 7 shaft is
in hand. No estimate is given of the
additional quantity and) grade of ore
likely to become available, but it will help
lengthen the life of the mine.
Meanwhile the hunt for new ore de-
posits continues, A prospect is being
tested by churn drill on the old Chillagoe-
Mungana field (Q.), and detailed ex-
amination of likely areas on the Clon-
curry field (Q.) is in hand. Results of
exploration work at Zeehan (Tas.), under-
taken in conjunction with North 8.H.,
should soon be known.
During the year £664,364 was added
to the book-value of shareholdings, rais-
ing the figure to £2,159,562, which is
£109,545 below cost. The portfolio
covers a score of cos., mostly in the
heavy and allied industries. When the
books closed the mine, etc., figured at
£273,709 and plant £1,347,397. More or
less liquids totalled £3,963,485, and out-
side liabilities, including final div.,
£1,526,239.
The market prices the f.-p. ss. shares
at 545. each, thus valuing the undertaking
at £8,640,000. After deducting surplus
liquids, £6,200,754 remains to be re-
covered from mining, etc., over, say, the
next 10 years, which means divs, averag-
ing 77.5 p.c. over that period. Everything
depends upon the course of metal prices
and costs. And there is the chance of a
worth-while prospect turning up. Im-
mediate return at 545. is 10.2 p.c. on a
110 p.c. div. basis, or 7.1 p.c. on a 77.5
p.c. basis.

This co. is the only cement producer of

on a basis that will make it difficult for

first 8 p.c, and 182,183 second 6 p.c. cum.
prefs. and 18,000 ords., all of £1 each.
The prefs. rank in the order stated for
divs. and capital, and advance point for
point with the ords. after the latter have
had 6 p.c. Those on the register have
never failed to receive an annual distri-
bution for the last 21 years, the average
being 9.2 p.c. firsts and 7.2 p.c. seconds
and ords.
The effects of the 40-hour week, which
operated from Jan. 1, 1948, and of the
continued rise in costs last term were
practically offset by a record output of
cement (151,841 tons, up 20,513 tons)
and small lift in the controlled selling
price. Abolition of War-time (Co.) Tax
helped, too. After allowing £31,181 (up
£4382) for depreciation and something
for taxation, the net result was £9171
stronger at £31,300, second-best showing
in the co.’s history. It was enough to
pay the prefs. their minimum require-
ments, plus 6 p.c. to the ords., and then
show 6.4 p.c. on the whole capital (pref.
and ord, combined) as against 2.6, 1.4,

To meet the year’s outlay the co, went
outside for an extra £54,501 and reduced
stocks by £20,026, The contraction in
the more-or-less liquid surplus (£79,551)
was £50,559, due to expenditure on plant,
etc.
To meet the anticipated growth in de-
mand, especially in the southern part of
the State, another kiln (capacity 100,000
tons cement p.a.), together with ancillary
plant, is to be installed at Darra. This
new kiln is not expected to come into
production for about two years. A new
cement plant is also to be erected at
Townsville in collaboration with the
Queensland Government. The co. will
put up part of the capital and supervise
construction work, scheduled for com-
pletion in about four years. It will also
manage the undertaking for 12 months
after production begins. Financial and
technical details of the Townsville
venture are not given, nor is the amount
of new capital outlay involved at Darra
mentioned. And no hint is given as to
the extent, if any, to which shareholders
might be asked to assist.
The market expresses its hopes by
pricing the firsts at 475. and the seconds
at 38s. as against 455. and 365. respec-
tively a year or so ago. At the higher
figures the return is 3.8 p.c. firsts and
3.7 p.c. seconds on the basis of last term’s
distributions. The ords. seldom appear
on ’Change. Net tangible cover (book-
value) is £7 13s. 2d. firsts, 325. lOd.

The Sugar Industry adds £15,000,000
a year to the Nation’s wealth
About 600,000 tons of sugar are produced in
Australia each year. It is consumed, not only in
the homes, but in the jam, biscuit, bacon and
confectionery factories, in the breweries, bakeries,
milk condenseries and whatnot. It earns for the
growers and the processors something like
£15,000,000 a year.
Naturally, so vast an industry calls for much
"financing” and, ever since the industry started in
the sixties of last century, this Bank has played a
large part in this financing.
The Bank, of course, plays a large part in financing
many industries. Its funds are used to aid its
customers carry on and develop their activities.

Bulolo Gold Dredging
Bulolo (paid capital $5,000,000
in $1 shares) is back on the divi-
dend list again with an interim
$1 (Canadian) a share, due Nov,
16 and payable Dec. 3, less
Canadian absentee tax of 15
]*c. to Australian shareholders.
The tax reduces the div. from
20 p.c. to 17 p.c. Last previous
payment was $1.5 a share in
Dec., 1941, just before the Jap
invasion of New Guinea, where
the co.’s property is. In May,
1947, three of the original eight
dredges were in commission
again. A year later six were at
work, and, according to monthly
returns, the co. had treated
7,855,000 c.y. for 74,0940 z. fine
gold. There is over 120,000,000
c.y. of pay-dirt ahead of the
dredges and 21,000,000 c.y. for
hydraulicking. Two new areas
were recently acquired, but
scout-drilling of one failed to
come up to expectations. In
Australia the $5 shares recently
sold at £6 155., on which the in-
terim div. just announced, less
Canadian tax, is equal to 3.9 p.c.
London - controlled Gold
Fields Australian Development
(paid capital £500,000 in ss.
shares) records a loss of £4590
for 1947 as against a loss of
£5822 for the previous year. At
end Dec. last the co. held
£86,719 in cash, debtors’ bal-
ances, etc., to meet outside
liabilities of £4389. Last div.
was 5 p.c, in 1940, and it is
difficult to say when the next
one might be paid. Co. owns
all the £300,000 paid capital in
Moonlight Wiluna, the Mt. Ida
Gold Mine, a 25 p.c. interest in
Mt, Charlotte, and a one-third
interest in Porphyry (1939)
Gold Mine, all in W.A. Moon-
light, which showed a loss of
£8262 for the year, making ac-
cumulated losses £108,279, be-
gan retreatment of the cyanide
residues at the Moonlight and
Wiluna mines toward the close
of accounts. At Mt. Charlotte,
of which much was expected,
the outlook has been rendered
uncertain by rising costs; ex-
ploration work has been slowed
down and the pay-roll shortened.
The option on Charlotte, in
which Wiluna holds the major
interest, runs until end 1950. At
Porphyry (taken over in Sept.,
1947) work has been severely
curtailed by shortages of labor
and materials; here the drill in-
dicated some 750,000 tons of
approximately 4dwt, ore. Mt.
Ida (bought in 1942 for £10,000)
treated 3882 tons for 19350 z.
gold during eight months to
Feb., 1948, when treatment
stopped in favor of develop-
ment.

SUNDRY SHOWS
HAROLD BLAIR.
The Queensland aboriginal
tenor Harold Blair has valuable
concert-platform assets quite
apart from his vocal technique.
He is handsome' has a splendid
physique and bearing and pos-
sesses that rarest of concert-
platform attributes, the ability
to create a bond of understand-
ing between singer and audience.
At his first appearance in
Sydney with the Symphony
Orchestra at the Town Hall on
Saturday night Blair brought
a well-produced tenor of excel-
lent timbre and respectable range
to a bracket of recitatives and
airs from Handel oratorio. His
handling of the none-too-easy
“Waft Her, Angels,” from
“Jephtha,” was quietly authori-
tative and marked by a silk-
smooth transition between the
registers. His notes above Ein
this and in the “Sound An
Alarm,” from “Judas Macca-
basus,” which followed, .had a
good ringing quality, and in the
last item his style of heroic
declamation was first rate.
Above all, he sang this music
with intelligent appreciation of
its emotional impact.
Under Joseph Post the
orchestra’s accompaniment to
-the tenor was suave and dis-
creet. Earlier it had given a
captivating rendition of Han-
del’s “Water Music” Suite. De-
lius’s “Brigg Fair” was as medi-
ocre as the work itself—Delius
tends to monotony in too many
of his scores, and “Brigg Fair”
is one of the most difficult to
listen to. The ballet music from
Gustav Holst’s “The Perfect
Fool” was excruciating, which
was not the orchestra’s fault.
Holst’s opera is a satire on the
florid style of Italian opera ; it
remains now for some Italian
composer to write a skit on the
Holst work.
The orchestra wound up the
night’s work with a reading of
Tschaikowsky’s Fourth Sym-
phony—the least attractive of
the only three of his that are
now played—which lacked noth-
ing in the way of vigor.
Throughout the evening
Joseph Post handled his forces
with strength and judgment.
"The Paragon."
Roland and Michael Pertwee’s
“The Paragon,” currently pre-
sented at Sydney Minerva, should
be popular, since it contains
something for almost everybody.
It is modern —post-war —it is
English and there is humor, wit,
a love interest and, in the prob-
lem of “The Paragon” as a de-
serter and an over-indulged
child, a nice blend of psychiatric
interest and social problem for
those who like such fare.
On the other hand the theme
—a father’s obsession with the
memory of his son, and his re-
actions when he realises that,
far from being a dead hero, the
young man is an uncomfortably
active deserter and a scoundrel
—gives the play some faint pre-
tensions to tragedy. They are
very faint pretensions—there is
no real development of charac-
ter, the theme is hackneyed, and,
anyway, Messrs. Pertwee can’t
have it every way. A good deal
of their ingenuity seems to have
been devoted to the development
of bright backchat and to the
action, which cascades in a final
scene —a. fight in the dark —
which would do credit to the
fertile imagination of a director
of Hollywood westerns.
Some of the topical interest
in the play is lost by transplant-
ing. The deserfer has an in-
credibly hard time in post-war
England, snatching ration-books,
sleeping under hedges and being
pursued by the police—all incon-
veniences which the Australian
war-time deserter is not called
upon to endure. The character,
however, is plausible, and
Michael Pate gets the best out of
it in its lighter moments and
during the tough and crisp back-
chat and on every occasion when
he is not called upon to display
agonising fear. His perform-
ance is the best in the show. He
brings an admirable swaggering
bravado to the part, judging
nicely the interplay of that with
a necessary cowardice, and,
whether the interpretation is his
own or the playwright’s, it
creates the necessary slight
bridge of sympathy between the
audience and a character who
would otherwise be too con-
temptible to be real,
Richard Parry is the insanely-
fond father, a character given an
additional interest by the fact
that he is, apparently, a million-
aire, a self-made man of
mechanical genius and is blind.
Parry, too, fails in the moments
of high emotional tension, more
because of the weaknesses of the
play than the players, and his
voice is not always clearly in-
telligible. But he exploits fully
the dramatic possibilities of
blindness, bringing a brisk con-
fidence to the part and a kind of
testy urbanity and, on one oc-
casion, making a play with his
hands as dramatically effective,
in its way, as the graphic gesture
Olivier made in Richard 111
when he became king.
Leslie Victor is good as the
Earl of Clandon, a benevolent
and rather comic aristocrat,
with a strong family resemblance
to the noble persons in senti-
mental magazines. Therese Des-
mond, as Jessica, another aristo-
cratic and comic character, is ad-
mirable. Jessica Noad makes a
charming and lively Angela, the
Paragon’s wife who unknowingly
commits bigamy with Max,
nephew and heir of the Earl.
Max has embraced the unaristo-
cratic profession of medicine,
and, in the person of Grant Tay-
lor, is a gallant Army doctor with
shining buttons, ribbons and a
fine head of red hair. Taylor, as
Max, makes a virile figure in the
Clark Gable tradition, but is
over-inclined to inflate his chest
and growl menacingly through
his teeth, a picturesque charac-
teristic, but one which does not
always lend itself to clarity of
enunciation.
Kathleen Robinson plays the
part of Joan, the blind tycoon’s
second wife, with a graceful
ease suited to the play’s moments
of light comedy, but, like most
of the other players, she lacks
emotional intensity. Here
again the play is probably more
to blame than the player. Strictly
speaking, it has no moments of
high drama. It is, rather, a
clever hotchpotch of melodra-
matic situations, crisp dialogue
and what the Americans suc-
cinctly term “corn,” all dressed
up to look like a rare and
diverting salad. In its way, how-
ever, it is entertaining and moves
quickly enough.
Melbourne Tiv.
Anybody liable to attacks of
the dingbats had better keep
away from Melbourne Tiv. at
present, where Jerry Grey, a
magnificently proportioned dan-
cer, is being strangled nightly by
a female python in the shape of
Jeanne Francis. Clad in green
scales. Miss Francis throws her
coils round his figure in such a
realistic manner that half the
house was hysterical when the
present commentator called in.
Having, apparently, no bones in
her body, the lady can simulate
the rather horrifying slackness
of the reptile to perfection, and
nobody would have been sur-
prised if, after mastering her
victim, she had swallowed him
lock, stock and barrel.
More soothing spectacles on
the Jiv.’s bill include the extra-
ordinary acrobatics of Marie
Louise, and the Remarkable
Rex Ramer, a 8.8. C. impres-
sionist who imitates orchestral
instruments and apparently has
a throat of metal. Freddie Bam-
berger provides a fresh gag a
minute and gets laughs even out
of a piano.
"Sorry, Wrong
Number."
Those ghostly wisps of some-
one else’s conversation that
creep occasionally into your
own on the local phone form the
framework of the film “Sorry,
Wrong Number,” a remarkable
stiffener now at Sydney Prince
Edward. Barbara Stanwyck
lives in a mansion comfortably
furnished with pills and papered

a fine piece of acting.

RED MILL RUM.
The Williamstown Cup meeting,
with the Cup itself going to the
rank outsider Gayness, proved no
more profitable for punters than had
any other day of the major Spring
racing. Qf the four important Cup
races contested in recent weeks, one
only has gone to a widely-backed
horse. And since the Moonee Valley
Cup-winner Howe was a hot favorite
beaten in two of the other three
Cups, he could scarcely be said to
have done punters much of a good
turn. Bookmakers will long remem-
ber the 1948 Spring racing session;
punters have shorter memories, other-
wise there’d be fewer of ’em.
Through no fault of his own,
jockey Harold Badger contributed
somewhat to the downfall of punters
on Saturday. The fine and popular
little horseman having announced that
it was to be his last day in the saddle,
the crowd decided that it would he
fitting to see him ride the programme,
and they proceeded to back his
mounts with more sentiment than
judgment. He had five mounts, and
was successful on one; on the others
something more than £13,000 was
invested on the win tote alone.
Badger rode Howe in the Williams-
town Cup, and, with the betting 8
to 1 bar one, the big New Zealander
started at 7to 4. After being well
placed early he finished a moderate
fifth; the only excuse possible for
Howe was the one which was obvious
before the race—that he had had too
much hard racing and no time to
recover from the injury he received
in the Melbourne Cup.
Starting at 40 to 1, while the next
roughest in the betting was Valcurl
at half those odds, Gayness made
an exhibition of the Cup field; the
race was as good as won two fur-
longs from home. Westralian set a
fairly hot early pace and held the
lead to the turn, but once into the
straight Gayness sprinted away from
them, Anthelion and Red Fury finish-
ing best of the others. Gayness was
ridden by L. Lott, back from a long
spell of riding in India, where he
landed over 300 winners.
Before any important race these
days followers of the game are
regaled, per media of the daily press,
with the reported views of various
connections of horses engaged. Some
racegoers seem to place greater store
by such “opinions” than they do
by such trifles as breeding, handi-
capping and a careful assessment of
form. Of course, the opinions are
a great thing to be guided by—pro-
vided one heeds the right one. Prior
to the Williamstown Cup the owner
of Howe was reported a‘s hoping “the
people who backed Howe in the
Melbourne Cup would do so again
in the Williamstown Cup.” Evidently
a good many of them did.
A rather better bit of prognos-
tication was supplied by Gayness’s
trainer, D. Mcßae, who said, simply,
that he was starting his horse in the
Cup because he didn’t consider the
race would be bard to win, as so
many horses had had a lot of hard
racing. At that, Mcßae hit the nail
right on the head.
The Cup win recompensed Mcßae
for a disappointment earlier in the
day when his very good jumper
Latani (Mcßae handles mostly
jumpers) started favorite for the
Sandown Hurdle only to . come a
spectacular cropper at the second
jump. The event was won by Gal-
lant Gentleman (L. Meenan).
Badger’s lone success of the day
was on the St. Magnus colt Gay
Saint, starting favorite to down Gal-
way Pipe and River Hero in the six-
furlongs Strand Handicap. His less
successful efforts were on Rover’s
Mark, finishing third behind Hunch
(J. Purtell) and Kintail in a five-
furlongs scamper for two-year-olds;
on Good Idea, second behind Colin’s
Pride (L. King) in the 10-furlongs
Captain Robinson Handicap; and on
Dumfries, unplaced in the Heatherton
Handicap. Old St. Fairy, lumping
10.5, produced one of those fine
efforts of his to beat Sun Lyric and
Leonatus in the Heatherton.
* * * *
Saturday’s Warwick Farm meeting
at Randwick was a wondrously good
one for punters, four favorites and
a second favorite being successful
before Bell Rock (F. Williams) at
50 to 1 gave the bookies a helping
hand in the last race.
Opposed by only three compara-
tively mediocre performers of his
own age over a mile at Quality
weights, Riptide (R. Coles) looked a
really good bet, but there was a
strange reluctance to back him. At
one stage the betting-boards showed
2 to 1 each of three, with the maiden
Prenero at 20 to 1; even as good
as 5 to 2 was obtainable against
Riptide, who led all the way to
win narrowly but well.
The Ajax colt Boneith (B. Smith)
made his score two wins from two
starts by easily downing Chitral and
Golden Brew in the Junior Stakes;
though unplaced, Gay Ronald shaped
like a sure coming winner. Had Chit-
ral managed to win the Junior Stakes
he would have completed a nice
double for owner E, A. Underwood,
trainer M. McCarten, jockey W.
Cook and the sire Dhoti; earlier that
combination had been successful in
the Kindergarten Stakes for fillies with
Vicereine, a very promising galloper.
The aged Felcrag mare Glencrag
(F. Williams) added to her recently
excellent record by comfortably beat-
ing a field of useful sprinters in the
Horsley Handicap (6f.); Monogram,
looking well above himself in con-
dition, was a good second, and
favorite The Groom third. In the
Horsley there was a remarkable bet-
ting plunge on the New Zealander
Great Trek, making his first appear-
ance here; he shared the lead to the
turn but faded right out in the
straight.
Favorite for the 10-furlongs Mil-
perra Handicap, Doughnut (J. Thomp-
son) was very hard pressed to beat
Flying Duke by a nose, but, with
the camera in operation, an inch,
these days, is truly as good as a
mile.
Restricted races are not frequently
run at distances of 12 furlongs or
more; when they are, breeding offers
as good a clue as any to the probable
result. Tamunga (J. Eaves), who won
Saturday’s 13-furlongs Novice, is a
four-year-old by that good sire of
stayers Marabou.
* * * *
The four-year-old Beau Son gelding
Hurry Up has been living up to his
name. After winning a Mixed Stakes
and being just pipped in an 11-
furlongs Handicap on successive
Saturdays in Sydney, he was last
week rushed to Brisbane to com-
fortably win the Queensland Cup
(2m.). Moneith, runner-up in the
Queensland Derby, again finished next
best in the Cup—no disgrace, as he
was meeting the older horse at level
weights over a trying distance.

Harold Badger goes into retire-
ment with the good wishes of all
interested in racing. His general
ability and individual riding successes
do not need enumerating here. The
best comment on the man himself is
that he has shown the sense and the
willpower to retire at his top—so
many, not only jockeys, but men in
every walk of life, reach the top only
to continue down the other side.

Two factors entered the playing of
the N.S.W. Close Golf Championship
at Royal Sydney consistency and
brilliance. Eric Cremin supplied the
consistency with rounds of 70, 70,
71 and 71. Back from playing his
way round the world, Von Nida had
occasional bad patches but was bril-
liant under pressure; he recorded
74, 68, 72 and 67 to win by a stroke.

land, Bradman made devastating use

ing apparently seen the light, the
M.C.C. has amended the by-law to
now allow a new ball after 65 six-
ball overs. Here at present the de-
mand is made after 40 eight-ball
overs, but this is subject to review.

In his testimonial match at Mel-
bourne Bradman will be for a change
on the receiving instead of the direct-
ing end of Lindwall’s fast stuff;

Intent on revenging their recently-
obliterated brethren, a team of Eng-
lish women cricketers lobbed into
Perth last week, and landed a few
telling punches in the opening round.
Against the Westralian XI, the Eng-
lish lasses scored 293 for four wickets
(declared) and 160 for one (declared)
and then routed the opposition for
46 arid 67 for eight wickets —a very
one-sided draw.

World professional sculling cham-
pion Bobby Pearce recently decided
that holding the title unchallenged
was a rather withered laurel. He de-
clared the title vacant and nominated
Australians Max Fisher and Evans
Paddon as the logical contenders.
As a result Paddon and Fisher are
to meet on the Parramatta (N.S.W.)
next Saturday. Instead of doing a
straight three-miles course they are
to row round buoys providing three-
quarter-mile laps; this may slightly
favor the lighter and faster Fisher,
but Paddon, a huge chap, may win
by sheer strength.

rounds; then Sprouster began scoring
with straight lefts and gave his
opponent no further chance.

Trade Balance
More money is still arriving
from overseas than commodi-
ties, The inflationary conse-
quences of our export-surplus —•
“favorable trade balance” may
be too unequivocal a phrase at
this stage except for the most
ardent Mercantilist —had shown
signs of lessening at the end of
last financial year, thanks largely
to the gathering stream of British
imports. The tendency, how-
ever, has been sharply reversed
in the first three months of this
year. Traditionally the Sep-
tember quarter is a quiet one
for Australian exports, but, in
contrast to the same period in
1947, a visible export-deficit of
£13.2 million has been turned
into a surplus of £19.6 million.
At least two abnormal factors
had a part in the transformation.
The floodgates against dollar im-
ports were closed last year after
the September quarter had prac-
tically run its course —they had
amounted to £24 million for the
three months as against only
£8.6 million for the same period
this term. That difference will
not be maintained at the same
rate for the remainder of the
year, although the closing of the
gates wasn’t an instantaneous
affair and dollar goods came in
fairly strongly for some time
after September, 1947.
Wheat has figured with special
prominence in our latest quar-
terly export returns —in quantity
the shipments were seven times
greater than for the same three
months of 1947, and in value 10
times greater—and this partly
results from the carryover of
our exceptionally large 1947
harvest. It is suggested in some
quarters that the record U.S.
wheat crop this year means that,
despite E.R.P., prices are around
their peak. But a . great leeway
in the transportation and ship-
ping of our harvested wheat has
still to be overtaken, and large
quantities should be exported for
some time; much of it is sub-
ject to period-contracts as to
price,.
Despite abnormal features in
the new quarterly figures, it
therefore seems likely that the
Australian export-surplus will
be maintained at a higher figure
for this full year than the £6B
million recorded in 1947-48 —
which had represented a decline
by 30 p.c. on the figure for the
previous term. Two other
dominating factors will be the
progress of the wool-sales and
Britain’s export-drive.
Wool contributed no less than
wheat and the dollar-shortage to
the transformation this Sep-
tember. Exports of greasy and
scoured combined were one-third
greater by weight than in the
corresponding quarter of 1947
and nearly twice as great in
value. Britain remained the
largest buyer, but was run a
much closer second by the
French, who seem to have con-
centrated rather more on high-
grade wool this time. U.S.A.
was third, making its presence
felt earlier than usual in the
selling season; its purchases of
greasy were one-third of
Britain’s by weight but one-half
in value. Fourth position was
filled by Russia, which bought as
much last quarter as in the whole
1947-48 year, and took on the
average more expensive types
than Britain or France. The
general trend towards quality
should get more scope from
offerings later in the season, and
present prices are substantially
higher than at this time in 1947.
Our large export surplus at
the end of September wasn’t
caused by any abatement of im-
ports from Britain. On the
contrary, these were a strong
counter-influence. They were
double the imports for the same'
period of 1947, or 50 p.c. above
the average for the whole
1947-48 term; in the month of
September alone they exceeded
any previous monthly record by
over 10 p.C. It has been a re-
markably sustained effort, but
the fact should be noted that at
least half the rise over the last
twelvemonth took the form of
motor-cars and textiles. In both
fields a limit on further rapid
expansion may be imposed by
the local demand. Imports of
machinery from U.K. are still
urgently needed, but when the
matter was raised at the recent
Dominions’ conference in Lon-
don Sir Stafford Cripps em-
phasised the strain already placed
on British makers of capital
equipment by home and over-
seas orders.
Consolidated Press
An interesting preliminary
move to the steps being taken
by Consolidated Press for con-
version to a public company is
revealed by the board’s state-
ment that all but £50,000 of the
£575,000 ordinary capital now
belongs to Sydney Newspapers
Pty. : Until very recently this
was not the case. Sydney News-
papers —mainly owned by E, G.
Theodore and D. F. H,. Packer
—had hitherto held only 365,000
Consolidated Press ords., while
another 160,000 belonged to
Associated Newspapers, Ltd.
The “Sun” people took up
their holding in 1936 as exchange
for the “Daily Telegraph”
newspaper and plant in the old
Evening News Building. Now
the holding has evidently been
transferred to Sydney News-
papers—the “Sun’s” nominee
stepped down from the Consoli-
dated Press board on October
31 —but the terms of that deal
aren’t published. The former
share - link hadn’t prevented
some brisk competition between
Consolidated Press and Associ-

ated News in the women’s' and
Sunday newspaper fields.
Consolidated Press has been
one of the first to react to the
new penalty tax rates on private
concerns. Its publications are
competing, says the board, “with
those of other newspaper pro-
prietors throughout Australia,
most of which are already clas-
sified as public cos.” There will
be no new issue, but 170,000
existing £1 ords. rather
more than the old “Sun”
interest —will be offered to the
public at a premium of 15s. plus
brokerage. One-quarter of the
placement, which is underwritten
by Hordern, Utz and Bode, will
be reserved for pref. share-
holders in Consolidated Press
and its subsidiary, Conpress
Printing, Ltd. New ord, share-
holders will qualify for receipt
on December 22 of a 5 p.c. tax-
free dividend from past profits.
plus an interim, taxable 3 p.c.
for the current year, making the
ex dividend price about 33 s.
Tax-paid reserves are con-
sidered sufficient to pay 5 p.c,
for a further six years on the
present ord. capital, and in addi-
tion taxable divs. will be de-
clared “as the directors deem
prudent.” On book-values, the
£1 ords. have net tangible cover
of about 10s. each, but a recent
outside valuation of fixed assets
would put the figure at nearly
19s.
Aggregate profit of parent and
subsidiaries for the year ended
March 28, 1948, has just been
announced as £115,217 after pro-
viding £51,500 for tax (com-
pared with £62,976 in 1947,
after £39,250 tax); allowing for
pref. div. requirements, it repre-
sents 18 p.c. on ord. capital.
The board expects profits to be
well maintained this term. First
shipments of the new plant for
Conpress Printing are soon due
to arrive from U.K.
With the Bank of N.Z. in the
bag, State planners in Maori-
land can’t keep envious eyes off
insurance cos., which are
among the biggest money-spin-
ners left in M.L, business today.
A year ago M.L.’s Labor Gov-
ernment was getting ready to
grab workers’-compensation in-
surance, but it held off. Now it
plans to make this a State
monopoly next April. South
British and N.Z. Insurance,
M.L.’s two big leaders in the
underwriting field, are head of a
group of 40 concerns that claim
they’ve handled this class of risk
well for half a century. Ken-
neth B. Myers, South British
chairman, condemns State sei-
zure of workers’ claims to set
up a Government riionopoly. Up
to now workers have had
prompt and efficient settlements.
Will they be as well served if
the State kills competition and
binds their claims in red tape?
Motor risks are still expensive
for insurers, burglary claims are
on the rise, and theft and pilfer-
age remain high. Mr. Myers
scents a change in business as
boom influences pass, and ex-
pects losses to/swallow a bigger
percentage of underwriting in-
come. Fields he is scanning for
signs of improvement are
Palestine and Malaya. India,
East Asia and Africa are on the
up grade.

form of stock has certain ad-
ministrative advantages com-
pared with straight-out share
subdivision. Smaller capital
units will bring the scrip within
reach of a wider range of in-
vestors, and should broaden
ownership of the bank. For the

LIFEBOAT
By "MACNELL"
(Based on the daily log kept by J. Sheather,
bosun of the Nellore, and an account of
the voyage by the third-engineer in charge
of the boat, W. Churchill) *
This is the story of a 2000-
mile fight against the sea; a
saga of the plain grit and un-
breakable determination of a
handful of ordinary men faced
with the necessity of sailing an
open boat from Chagos Archi-
pelago to Madagascar.
It is also the story of a boat;
not of a racing-shell, or gleam-
ing harbor-cruiser, or graceful
clipper-yacht but a common,
bluff-bowed, undecked seaboat.
Simply made, it kept out water,
and in every plank was wreathed
the lives of the 44 men and one
woman who sailed in it. For 28
days it bared its breast, hour
after hour, against the unceas-
ing enmity of ocean, the endless
smiting of huge waves with all
the infinite march of the Indian
Ocean rolling on behind them ;
and for 28 days this seaboat
struck them back into a smoke
of futile foam, won its' way
against them and kept its charge
of life from them. Could any
other soulless thing do as much?
At 11.45 p.m. on June 29,
1944, about 800 miles due south
of Ceylon, the twin-screw ship
Nellore was struck port side
forrard by a torpedo from an
enemy submarine, believed to be
Japanese, She slowed and be-
gan almost immediately to settle
by the bow. Luckily, the for-
rard bulkheads held until the
native crew lowered her boats.
Sheather was blown from his
bunk, and made his way on deck
through a shambles of splintered
woodwork with two other Aus-
tralian seamen, A. Litster and
M. McCullock. They tried to
release the rafts which merchant-
men were required to carry
during the war, but the Sen-
house slips on their slipping-
gear fouled and jammed.
About midnight, while work-
ing round No. 4 port lifeboat,
the chief-officer, hurrying past,
shouted that the ship was about
200 miles e.s.e. of Diego
Garcia, in the Chagos Archi-
pelago. At the same time he
ordered them to abandon ship.
To prevent overloading by the
near-panicking native crew the
Australians lowered the boat
past deck-level down to the
water. Even so, with the ship
lifting her stern so that her
screws hung clear and with the
menace of an unseen enemy
lurking somewhere in the night,
only strong action on the bosun’s
part prevented a rush to slide
into the boat.
Litster and McCullock each
took a Javanese baby in one
arm and swung themselves down
Jacob-ladders into the boat.
When full it shoved off and
Humped down the ship’s side,
past the dripping screws and the
after-gun’s crew, still closed up
under the second mate waiting
for a chance if the sub. surfaced.
Then they were clear, with the
ship an indeterminate bulk be-
hind them.
At that moment a submarine
surfaced a few yards away in a
wallowing hiss of compressed
air and submerged again almost
at once. It was probably a mis-
calculation on her captain’s part,
for a few minutes later she sur-
faced again off the ship’s port
bow. Then another shouldered
its way up from below surface,
both craft switched on steaming
lights to prevent colliding and
opened fire on their stationary
victim ; two finding-shots, then
rapid salvos into her belly.
The ship began to burn amid-
ships, a dull glow which rocketed
into a flux of fire as her maga-
zines went up. Beyond the circle
of light the bosun’s boat waited.
At about 2 a.m. her remain-
ing bulkheads collapsed and Nel-
lore rolled on her bearp-ends
into the depths.
Churchill, the engineer and
senior officer in the boat, asked
the bosun to take cox’n, which
he did. Turning the boat away
from those lights ahead, they
found another set heading
straight for them. t It was a sub-
marine, and she was coming up
fast. They saw her bulk, the
white wash at her bows and
smelt her oil. All hands crouched
in the boat, listing her danger-
ously to starb’d. Already she
was half-full of water, the sun-
opened planking not having
swelled. They heard' cries of
“Don’t, don’t!” and- “Help!”,
coming from the other subs.
Then, with their , immediate
danger almost on them, a squall
blotted them out in curtains of
streaming rain.
When it cleared they were
alone on a calm sea. The boat
lay off the scene of the action
till daybreak, when the 45 dazed
yet thankful adults took stock of
themselves and their position.
They had drifted in the night,
as there was no sign of wreck-
age, only two lifeboats in the
distance. The mast was stepped,
sail was set and course laid
w.n.w. for Diego Garcia, with
a fair s.e. wind behind them.
In addition to Churchill,
Sheather and four Australian
seamen, the boat held a naval
gunner, three Lascars, three male
Javanese, one Javanese woman
with her two children (one a boy
aged two years and a girl aged
10 months), three Mohamme-
dans and 28 Goanese stewards.
All told, 47 souls.
To keep them alive, the boat
stowed four breakers of water
(about 40 gallons), enough bis-
cuit to last 30 days on half-
ration, two cases of condensed
milk, some tins of meat extract
and several tins of chocolate
(some of which had been pil-
fered, either on board or in
dock). There were no malted-
milk tablets, which was bad for
the woman breast-feeding her
baby, and no matches.
The boat by this time was
tightening up, but the pump had
still to be used to keep the influx
down. Though old, she was a
sound craft —just how sound no
one in her believed they would
sail 2000 miles to find out. She
was 27ft. long, with a beam of
6ft. 6in.; and, though in good
condition, her running-gear was
not. The mainsail was worn and
her sea-anchor was unusable.
A ration of 2ioz. of water
and one biscuit three times daily
was put into effect immediately.
Already, a disturbing sound on
the vast emptiness around them,
the little boy was crying for
water. But, as issues were set
for daybreak, noon and sunset,
he had to wait.
In fairly hopeful spirits the
survivors in their tiny craft
headed at three knots with a
following wind for the nearest
patch of sand on which they
might fall —the curl of earth
named Diego Garcia, 200 miles
to the west.
As the morning progressed
the sun’s rays fell steeply out of
a cobalt sky. To escape the
brassy heat the Indians tried to
huddle in the sail’s lee, listing

“Blirae”: Old Barbie folded the local
rag, shoved it into a side pocket, and
once more stepped into the post-office.
“Whassa time now, Dick?” he inquired.
“Three o’clock? Well, that’ll be about
right then,” he continued. “It sez after
three.” Ten minutes later he knocked at
the end house up the road and asked
nervously for Mr. Holston, “You’ll have
to wait y’r turn,” he was told. “He’s busy
seeing someone.” The old bloke took
his place in the row of applicants, and
half an hour later was directed to a room
where a man sprawled comfortably in an
easy chair, “It’s this job y’ advertised
about in the local,” Barbie began. The
other eyed him up and down appraisingly.
“Awright, y’ know what it said,” he
nodded. “Got to be good ; see? Go on.”
“Yair, well” Barbie hitched his belt
and plunged in. “I think I’d suit y’
awright. I’m a fair sort o’ bloke, an’—er,
reasonable, an’ all that. I tend t’ me job
an’ don’t interfere, an’ I’d look after y’r
interests.” The interviewer lit a cigarette
and puffed leisurely. “H’m. What’s your
idea about wages?” he asked. “Well,
I thought about six or seven quid,”
Barbie suggested tentatively. “I mean, if
y’ think that’s awright. It’s up t’ you, o’
course.” The interviewer’s head rolled
round to take in the old bloke once more.
“Awright,” he decided finally. “You’ll
do. Tell the others on y’r way out I been
suited, will y’? I’ll start work for y’ next
Monday,”

“Lower Tops’l”: One-legged seagulls
(B. 27/10/’4B) owe their infirmity mostly
to barracoota, which carry out the surgical
operation while the gulls are alighting to
pick up fish cleanings from ’coota boats.
In Victoria away from barracoota ports,
at places like Mallacoota Inlet, a maimed
bird is a rarity, yet at Portsea, where you
bang a tin to call the ocean fliers ashore'
in dozens to feed on scraps, at least 10
p.c. of the gulls are one-legged and odd
ones have no legs. The legless birds have
to adopt a special helicopter form of fly-
ing, but otherwise they are little handi-
capped. But mortality among the silver
gulls is due to a different cause. Seine-
netting on a back beach at Flinders (Vic.)
I’ve seen the yellow-billed “black molly-
hawk”—so-called by Bass Strait fisher-
men, though I fancy he’s an albatross of
sorts —fly in and snap in two the necks
of a dozen hovering seagulls merely for
sport.
“Herbert Dawson”; It was at an Auck-
land (M.L.) sheepdog trial. A tall, raw-
boned Scot with a grey beard was work-
ing a young Border Collie and not getting
good results. He showed considerable
patience, but when the.youngster looked
like hunting the sheep right out of the
grounds he roared “Come behind ma heel,
ye bluidy blankard, and I’ll gang aroun’
the sheep masel’.” The yell of delight
from the spectators was his sole reward.

“Old-timer”; Four feet down in the
clear water the Murray lobster came
slowly from its hole, its* feelers waving,
and drifted down the bank like a blue-
green shadow. It was exploring the
bottom of a crater when a piece of
water-logged bark, just buoyant enough
for the current to move, rolled sluggishly
along and sank right over the entrance
to the lobster’s home. Time passed. The
lobster was moving out of the crater when
off the sunken end of the log whereon I
sat appeared a 10- or 12-pound cod.
The big fish nosed the end of the log,
tail and side fins fanning lazily, while
the lobster froze. The cod moved along
the log, appeared to cogitate, then half-
turned towards the crustacean, which shot
backwards like an arrow for its hole.
I’d always regarded cod as lazy fish, but
there was nothing lazy about the way that
one darted after the lobster. Poor lobster
had hit the bark blockage with its tail,*
shot sideways, but was picked up on the
run and vanished into the cod. The fish
lazily swam along the bank, nosed the
bit of bark, pondered and drifted out into
“Pull your head in, shellback!”
the deeps. As it passed beneath me I’ll
swear it winked up through the water,

“Bo”: Tupper had sued his neighbor
Sanderson, with whom he had a long-
standing feud, for taking water from his
dam. His chief witness was abo. Jacky,
who had seen Sanderson cut the
wire fence and drive his dray to the edge
of the dam and fill his 40-gallon drum.
But in court all Jacky could do was
shuffle his feet and look at the floor.
Tupper’s solicitor coaxed him, and got
him as far as opening his mouth, but
still no words would come. The Beak
tried to put him at- his ease by telling
him to say just what he saw in his own
words, and it didn’t matter how much
time he took to get them out. Still he
shuffled his feet and said nothing. At
last the Beak lost patience. “Now, look,
Jacky,” he said sternly. “You must say
something —just whatever comes into
your head—now, out with it.” The abo.
looked up, thought deeply fdr a minute,
grinned widely and said, “By cripe, boss,
I saw snifter pitcher last night!”

“Billy T.”: In our valley Storky
Olsen holds the 25-metres sprint
record for cars, open class, from a stand-
ing start, and it was thus:
One evening outside the post-office
Nugget and Blue were inspecting the tiny
car that Storky had just bought for light
runabout work, and waited to witness
the feat of 6ft. 3in. of well-fed
Olsen _ being folded inside it. Storky
got his mail, greeted the interested
cobbers, inserted head and shoulders in-
side the vehicle and slowly crawled
after them. A whirring noise indi-
cated that Storky had reached the
controls; then the mates looked at each
other, and, with the perfect silent
co-ordination that comes from long
association in crime, moved aft, took a
rear mudguard each, and lifted. This, as
was expected, coincided exactly with the
descent upon the accelerator of the great
Olsen hoof, and the jalopy shud-
dered and screamed Uke a tramp in the
Bight with her screw bare. Maximum
boost had just been reached when the
experimenters let go. Two minor Halley’s
comets flew from the rear wheels, there
was a smell like a Liberator touching
down, and Storky and his projectile took
off, cleared a dog-fight, bounced under
the noses of two mokes nuzzling each
other and caused them to continue their
discussion in hysterical tones whilst erect
on their hind legs. By this time Storky
had found the brake and his chariot
screeched to a stop under the rear of a
four-tonner. Record, both for the time
made by Storky and by Nugget and
Blue as the big fellow came back rolling
up his sleeves.

“The 0.D.”: If “Betcha’s” sheep were
really starving and wouldn’t come at
maize (B. 10/11/’4B), it was probably be-
cause they were expected to eat the stuff
whole. With no upper teeth a sheep
would find even soft-shelled maize hard
to crush, and it’s no wonder there were
losses through starvation and what “B.”
calls an “overdose of grain,” but which
was really impaction. Try crushing the
maize, mate, and put it out in troughs.
Better still, spend your money on oats.
Still better, put away some hay or silage
when the season’s gooti, and stop moan-
ing.

“Sur Cingle”A short trip round abo.
camp-sites should convince anybody on
soil erosion. Where the sites are on clay-
flats the hearths, with their fire-hardened
clay protected by the usual capping of
small stones, are comparatively resistant
to erosion. In a district where the original
big stations have been subdivided into
smaller holdings that have at times been
recklessly overstocked, the hearths,
originally level with the rest of the flat,
now stand as tiny hills up to a couple
of feet above the surrounding clay. In
other places the hearths are prominent,
biff not so high, and here one finds the
old millstones that were used for grind-
ing nardoo and acacia seeds. The flat
stones look like mushrooms, each on its
stalk of clay. Wind and water whittle
away at the clay stalks,* but, protected by
the stone roof from thorough soaking.
they last long enough to show how the
surrounding ground has dropped away.
Another test is the absence of the £tone
artifacts that are normally scattered
about the hearths. On the flats to the
east and west of a small hill near here
there are probably some hundreds of old
hearths, but hardly a flake or a stone
implement remains; they have gone
with the top-soil across the gently-slop-
ing flats into a near-by watercourse
system, leaving clean-swept clay with a
few fire-blackened stones dribbling down
from the mounds that were hearths. And
some of those hearths must have been
level with the surface 40 or 50 years ago
when the tribes used them last.

“Mat’s Mate”: Walpetiega’s Aussie-
Rules cohorts were four points in the lead
with a minute to go when Mat flew high
and pulled down a mark. Every Un-
dowangie player and barracker eyed the
distance from Mat to the goal and sighed.
It was fully 70 yards, obviously too far
for a kick to carry over the leaping bodies
and reaching hands of the Walpe defend-
ers. Mat went slowly back, looked long
and carefully at the distant goal, ran for-
ward and kicked. As the ball left his
boot he let out a wild yell and raced at
full speed off to the side of the ground,
where he hurled himself upon a group of
spectators. All hands rushed to the spot,
women and girls screamed, dogs barked,
small boys danced with excitement, the
police dived among the brawlers. Almost
at once it ceased and Mat stood up, while
his puzzled victims breathed indignation
and threats. Mat left them and ran to-
wards the goal umpire. “Did it go
through?” he asked. “It did,” snapped
the g.u. “They all turned to watch
the brawl, and it landed about 15
yards out and bounced through before
they woke up.” “That’s what I reckoned,”
Mat said happily. Then the Walpetiega
followers wanted to start the brawl all
over again.

“Gravelsnatcher”: When Bill the
Goose and Rabbit Jenkins hit Perth on
their annual holiday they hire a fast car,
race out to the top of Greenmount hill,
and attempt to develop sufficient downhill
speed to coast into Midland Junction,
some three miles from the foot of the
hill. They were about to embark on their
latest effort when an old swaggie whom
they knew vaguely as Tinpot requested
a lift. Before they’d gone 50 yards the
old chap was straining at the floorboards
and imploring to be put ashore, but
nothing could halt their mad dash.
Rabbit was holding Tinpot down while
the Goose stood on the accelerator when
the high-powered motor-bike shot out of
a side-street and took after them. Rabbit
saw it in the rear-vision mirror and
acted so quickly that when the John
overhauled them he glanced quickly at
the inert form of Tinpot, accepted
Rabbit’s barely audible explanation, and
forged ahead with siren sounding to clear
the way. They screeched to a halt at the
hospital, and the John waited while they
carried Tinpot into the reception-room.
When they came out again they assured
their .escort that their mate was in good
hands, and drove slowly back to Perth.
Around Bumpercrop way now there’s an
old swaggie who talks confusedly of air-
borne cars and supersonic speeds.

“Old Bushman”; I have shot jabirus
(B. 27/10/’4B), but plead the law of
necessity. Working a small mining show
years ago out from Cooktown (N.Q.)
most of the time my mate and myself
hadn’t the price of, a postage-stamp, so
that our bill of fare was mostly kangaroo
and damper. And when occasionally in
the dry one of those big black-and-white
fliers began fishing on our waterhole we
shot and ate him. Incidentally, the most
southern place I’ve known this bird to
be shot was Metung, on the Gippsland
Lakes. There, of course, no one knew
what the giant avian visitor was, so they
bowled him over for identification.
Rarely is one seen south of the Tweed.
CAMPFIRE.
He gathered the leaves, the sticks and the bark
At the end of the day before it was dark.
The touch of a match and the flames burned
bright
And the gum-tree trunks were lit with the light.
He stood by the fire and wrinkled his nose,
Smelling the smoke as it curled and rose.
He spread out his hands to the warmth of the
blaze,
As man has done from his earliest days.
The bush had grown dim as the sparks flew high
And spangled the darkening blue of the sky.
A circle of light lay gold on the ground
And black was the night that hemmed him
round.
He stared at the coals, where a man’s dream
lies,
The light of the fire aglow in his eyes.
The billy was on and rising the steam,
The bubbles they blinked and danced in the
gleam.
He took off the billy and threw in the tea
And the sweet smell rose as fresh as could be.
And he drank that tea contented in mind,
His back to the fire to warm his behind.
VICTORIA.

“0.-t.”: The old Murray paddler Gem
sank again the other day, this time off
Cal Lai, on the S.A. border. She was
an old boat when I was first introduced
to her back in the ’teens of the century —
she was built at Moama in the ’seventies
—and even then she. had been under
water a few times. If I remember aright
she broke in half near Merbein around
1914, and there was a tale of her boiler
going up another time and hoisting the
cook or somebody into a gum-tree. She
made a regular run from Mildura to
Murray Bridge in the old days, under the
P.W. flag, and was (I believe) the biggest
boat on the river. Brought out to cope
with the river’s increasing tourist trade,
she had 42 passengers aboard when
she hit a snag, and a 74-year-old man —
who couldn’t have been much older than
the Gem —died from heart failure in the
general excitement. Nobody else was
hurt —they simply waited on the upper
deck till the inevitable boats appeared
and took them and their baggage ashore,
I wonder what’s become of her sisters,
the Ruby and the Pearl?

“Billy T.”: Tell “A.L.A.” that those
dogs in Kunming are still hungry (B.
27/10/’4B). The R.A.F. mess during the
recent dust-up was at the eastern end of
the town, just past that building on the
large double gates of which was painted
a huge, ferocious representation of a
mighty general who defended the district
about 900 years ago and whose scowling
likeness on the gates is expected to con-
tinue the same useful service—remember
him? Immediately beyond, the graves
covered the low kills, and a stroll was
full of gruesome possibilities. I have
there pelted a couple of mangy hounds
away from a fairly fresh pelvis. The
American pipeline from Calcutta ended
on top of that ridge, and when the bull-
dozers ripped a bed for the pipe and the
tanks it fed there was keen competition
between the pariah mongs and the des-
cendants who sought to shift disturbed
bones to less turbulent surroundings. The
tykes, however, are not entirely to blame
if their tastes lie that way; a straw
bundle found in the bottom of a dry
“Look, it Wobbles! Hasn't set properly !”
irrigation channel contained infant twins,
and, doubtless, the person who dumped
them there expected canine assistance in
their disposal. There’s a magnificent air-
strip at Kunming now, but the junks
still sail in single-file across the lake, then
pole up the river into the markets,
and the monks far above in the Shi Shan
temples still sip their fine green tea as
imperturbably as they did in “A.L.A.’s”
day, and probably did when the fierce
old general flourished 2000 ft. below.
“Bo”: One of the legs of Joe Mawby’s
tank-stand, long undermined by termites,
partially collapsed, tilting the 800-gallon
tank at a dangerous angle. In the months
that followed Ma Mawby kept at her
spouse with querulous persistence in the
hope of getting him to fix it. But Joe,
the tiredest man in and around Fleabite
Flat, always had an excuse of a more
urgent job. Then one day Joe’s wife was
filling a bucket at the tank when the
already damaged leg gave an ominous
crack and the tank tilted again, this
time almost on the verge of toppling.
She screamed, and about two minutes
later Joe came sleepily from the harness-
shed and mooched across to the kitchen.
This time Mrs. M. angrily pushed him
out and told him to see about it at once
or somebody would be getting killed? A
little later Joe came back, yawning. “You
haven’t fixed it already, have you?”
asked his wife testily. “No need t’,”
drawled Joe, dropping into a chair from
the extra exertion he’d been compelled
to use. “One o’ the laigs on the opposite
side’s got the white-ants in. That’ll give
way in time an’ the tank’ll right itself!"

“Narrin”: To my mind the most re-
markable sight in northern S.A. lies at
the western end of Pitchi-Ritchi Pass.
South of Beltana you travel over an in-
terminable series of clay-flats where, in
normal seasons, dust-storms prevail. On
your left is the wild rock wall of the
Flinders Range; to your right the red
sandhills that stretch away west to the
ultimate desolation that is Lake Torrens.
You strike a few stony hills near Hawker
and then endure more flats on the 40-
mile stretch to Quorn. Leaving Quorn
you enter the pass and wind through tall
hills at the bottom of a great gorge. The
hills gradually open out, the country be-
comes drier as you leave the short mallee
belt behind, and you climb the last up-
slope in the pass. That last hill is
bare and desolate, grey earth and red
rock —the same grey earth and red rock
that have been so damnably familiar for
a couple of hundred droughty miles that
you’re past believing there can be
any other kind of scenery. You reach
the dusty summit, and there, only a few
miles away, are the sparkling blue waters
of Spencer Gulf. You forget the road
and joyously hit every bump and rut for
the next half-mile as you watch that un-
believable stretch of blue. No matter
how many times you’ve travelled that
road, no matter how well you know
the sight of blue water lies over that last
hill, each time the sight i§ miraculous,
unexpected and intoxicating. All the dust
and dessication of the northern track,
the interminable potholes between
Hawker and Quorn are things to be
thankful for: they supply the necessary
contrast to that first sight of the
eternally wet plain below the hills.

“D.R.H.”: Now that the green-feed
has gone and the infinitely long crests
“smoke” all day in the breeze, the red-
sandhill country seems lifeless —’roos,
along with emus and most other birds
have left. But on the slopes, between
the sandhill wattle and needlebush above
and the mulga below, every small bush
is encircled by a pattern of tracks. Hunt-
ing around, one presently sees the track-
maker streak for shelter, usually under
a bush. There is time to identify the
streak only as something pinkish and
probably reptilian, but under the bush
one finds a small hole with an arched
entrance. A minute or two of digging
will disclose half a dozen inches of lizard
—the little “painted dragon” {Amphi-
bolurus picfus) of the sandhills, a per-
sistent little hunter*of insects, as his
tracks round the bushes indicate, and one
of the most gorgeous of Australian
lizards. The one before me has a thin
black vertebral line, with short cross-bars
of velvety black separated by bars of
pale yellow. His upper back is a deep,
rich cinnamon with spots of bright yel-
low and Warm apricot. These spots con-
tinue down the sides, where they are
enmeshed in a reticulation of black lines ;
this pattern shades off into birds’-egg
blue below. The head is generally bluish
above with rich yellow-green and bright
yellow along the upper lip back to the
ear. The lower jaw and throat are a soft
blue. The foreleg, too, is blue, with
light mottlings of black. The hind limb
is mottled, purple-brown, blue and black.

accurate: when caught the chromatic

ing among apricot spots. Half an hour
or so ago the same back was a light

“Chuck”: Dan arrived to dig out the
the rabbits in his comer adjoining Arch
Henty’s just as Arch, armed with mattock
and shovel, began rolling his sleeves on
his own side of the fence.. “Been going
to dig these out for months,” Arch
called. “But I was waiting for a good
burrer-dog.” “Aw, they ain’t necessary,”
Dan replied. “My mong. can’t do any-
thing but hunt and carry, but it don’t
matter just for diggin’-out.” “Too right
it matters,” contradicted Arch. “Bet you
drinks I’ll get more rabbits than you do
for the day.” Dan took up the chal-
lenge, and they started. All day they
kept track of each other, working slowly
up the hill in their respective paddocks,
and each sticking eagerly to the job. At
evening Dan spotted Arch making back
down, collecting his day’s catch as he
went, so he, too, knocked off and started
back to begin skinning. At the last
burrow, where he remembered leaving
two rabbits, he eyed the large pile of
carcasses with a puzzled frown. He
counted carefully and called to Arch.
“Fifty-two,” Arch answered him. “Funny,
too. Could ’a’ swore I had more’n that.
How did you go?” “Seventy-nine,”
yelled Dan. “Which goes t’ show a
burrer-dog ain’t the best thing t’ have,
after all,” he laughed, taking in the self-
satisfied grin on the mug of his weary
little carrier.

“Salmon Gums”: “Barney” is right.
The rabbit fumigant is carbon disulphide
(B. 20/10/’4B), and I can imagine its
effect on hunny in a closed-in burrow.
Our practice was to pump a whiff down
a.burrow and sniff at the openings to see
which were connected. The smell was
unmistakable and not unpleasant, and
you couldn’t notice any ill effects. But
at the end of the day you were unaccount-
ably weary, and you couldn’t concentrate
or calculate. The feeling was very similar
to that of an elector who returns home
after voting, mentally re-examines the
candidates, and wonders —and wonders.

“M. Turlutu”: For his development to
present-day mastership of all other living
things man has to thank speech as the
one vital accomplishment which has
brought him to it. Yet, his ideas as to
how that amazing accomplishment origi-
nated are still of the vaguest and most
unconvincing nature. Max Muller held
the philological floor for many years with
his sense-sound-reflex theory, but it
failed to stand up against Richard Paget’s
demonstration of the correlation of
speech with gestures. Then came the
holophrastic school, which" explained
speech as evolving from attractive bits
picked from continued chatter. Yet an-
other theory is based on the general
similarity in different languages of
sounds elicited by fright, pain, surprise
and, similar emotional upsettings. The
more philologists squabble over the sub-
ject the more confused and obscure does
it become. On top of it all is the fact
that the higher anthropoid apes possess
a larynx closely comparable to the human
organ, but none of them has ever learned
to speak or even to imitate speech. Yet
an ordinarily intelligent baby picks up a
working vocabulary in its first couple of
years, and at five or six is fluent in any
language which it regularly hears spoken.
* * * *
“Kelms”: What is a “ ’roo-dog” (B.
20/10/’48)? In W.A. it’s been evolved
from the greyhound-staghound cross, and
it’s become as stabilised as the Mendelian
laws of heredity will permit. Conse-
quently the dogs vary from massive beasts
with forelegs as thick as a man’s wrist to
pocket editions —best described as the
greatest amount of speed packed into the
least possible space—while the colors
range from brindle to blue.
No dog with any other notice-
able cross in him would be
offered or accepted as a ’roo-
dog, and an invariable con-
dition of sale is the dog’s
ability to kill and show.
They’re bom killers, A
’roo-dog “gone bush”
will destroy more * sheep
and lambs than a dozen
dingoes—and their skill in
showing is something to mar-
vel at. It’s partly hereditary,
but is brought to perfection
by skilful training. A good
dog will a ’roo for a
mile in a wide circle, kill him,
often with a flying leap and a
quick, skull-crushing snap and
will return to you in a
straight line. This is in bush
where visibility is limited to
a couple of hundred yards.
The breed we’ve developed in
the West is the fastest thing
on legs in Australia. I’ve
seen one overhaul a pack of
emus and pull down one after
another, leaving a trail of
broken-necked birds. Knew
a chap who tried out a Great
Dane. When it proved too slow in
the bush he reckoned it would do to
follow the chase and kill anything the
other dogs bayed. His dogs must have
been poor ones. Twenty years ago any
dog worth keeping wouldn’t bay a ’roo —-
he’d kill him, however big, and fly back
to where his master, left far behind, was
trying to make up lost ground—on a fast
horse.

“C.E.”: Dick’s soldier block in the
foothills showed brown and bare, and he
considered himself lucky at being able
to rent the paddock on the high top
country. It was midsummer, the new
paddock was a picture of knee-high green-
ness, and Dick planned to shift his cows
right away and let them fatten for the
autumn sales. “They won’t do no good,
son,” old Silver told him. “Not at this
time o’ year. If y’d took ’em up there in
the spring now, an’ let ’em come away
with the new grass, they’d have sum-
mered there awright, but not now.” Dick
thanked him patronisingly, smiled be-
hind his hand, and mustered his cows.
Four or five weeks later, a sadder and
wiser bloke, he turned them homeward
with a fervent hope they wouldn’t cut
up any more on the trip. Dick still can’t
understand it, but he shakes his head
now and solemnly declares there’s more
in stock-feeding than meets the eye.

“B. A. Ker”: A noteworthy quality of
the Australian bush ballad is its range of
appeal. Whether the young listener is a
boy who could ride a rough horse almost
as soon as be could walk or is a lad who
got his thrills out of scaling trams the
same shine will come to his eyes as he
visions a drover swimming a flooded river
or. a youth who “Mounted the rebel and
gave the word.” And the same shine may
come to the eyes of his grandfather. The
truth is that bush ballads talk to the Aus-
tralian in the language he likes best, and
they tell him the kind of stories he never
tires of hearing. But, of course, there
are exceptions—such as the fellow who
interrupted little Jumbo’s recital (the
name derives from his memory, not his
nine stone). “That stuff’s only rubbish,”
declared the stranger. “It ought to be
completely wiped out and the people
forced to read the real poets—such as the
late Chris. Brennan.” Jum breathed
rather heavily, but he spoke quietly: “I
did read a bit of Brennan’s stuff once;
but I still don’t know what he was trying
to say.” The other fellow looked learned.
“Ah, that’s the point,” he declared.
“Nobody could expect to fully under-
stand Brennan’s work; I can’t myself:
he is too deep, too profound. In fact, I
doubt if he really understood it himself.”
There was silence for several minutes;
then Jum began ,to recite Ogilvie’s
“Kings of the Earth,” and it seemed to
me that he managed to get pronounced
emphasis on the opening line: “We are
heathen who worship an idol,”
GRAPE-PICKING.
Green vines of grapes beneath a burning sun
That scorches shade and bakes the flat red land,
Green vines that lie as strange and cool as lakes,
Oases in the malice scrub and sand . . .
Flawless Sultanas cool in frosted green,
Bronzed Malagas like giant’s fingers growing,
Plump Gordos spattered with the sun’s own
gold
And Greenach gay in purple bloom agiowing.
Day’s first delight: the magpie’s warbling song,
Swift whirring of the crested pigeon’s wings,
The lazy flap of herons o’er the marsh,
Sweet fluting where the collared jackass sings ...
Then the galahs above the almond-trees
Rise crimson at the blocker’s angry yell,
Their startled cries the shrieks of feathered
fiends,
Their glowing wings reflecting fires of hell.
Quick savage snips, the rough-edged burning
tins,
A red-hot sun, bent backs that stretch with pain,
Persistent flies exploring maddened eyes,
Dry throats that drink, to dry and thirst again;
Harsh bite of wire-netting at the racks,
The sunburnt arms that lift and fall as one,
The drying fruit abruptly jerked away
And flung in golden showers against the sun —
So slowly crawl the leaden moments past,
As anxiously we wait the welcome cry
“Tea-oh! ”; and gratefully we drink it down,
Then sprawl at ease beneath a grape-leaf sky.
And then the shock of water, fresh and cold,
Washing away the sweat and dust of toil,
The weary muscles springing like a flower
Refreshed by rain upon a thirsty soil.

Starting with Sheep.
“Ngaduri”: If you can’t
afford a champion ram get the
next-best thing cast-for-age
ewes from a reputable stud in
lamb to a good ram. Avoid a
stud which buys everyone else’s
rams and boasts “rams to suit
all types of country.” The stud
should be on your type of
country and the sheep as near
as possible your ideal type, A
stud that hasn’t, used anyone
else’s rams for years and still
continues to stay near the top
in ram sales is safe. The c.-f.-a,
ewes will have proved their
breeding worth or they wouldn’t
have been kept in the stud till
they reached their age limit, and,
even though their wool and car-
cass may have gone off a bit, it
won’t affect the lambs.
When they lamb keep the ram
lambs entire —even the ones you
reject won’t be a loss. Mate the
pick of them to your flock ewes
as soon as they are old enough.
Six months should be the
earliest; and no more than 20
ewes to a ram. Keep an ac-
curate record of the ram and
his mates and use earmarks or
tags.
When the progeny are 18
months old pen them separately
(the progeny of each ram in
each pen) and have a good
classer pick out the best pen. If
any obvious faults show up re-
ject the rain, the dam and the
progeny—whatever they look
like. Don’t forget that infertility
and deaths at lambing through
malformation are hereditary
faults. If the best pen has no
obvious faults and all are nearer
the ram’s type than their
mother’s you have your top ram
—a two-year-old—and can now
mate him with his sisters and
daughters. This is the mating
which will prove his worth. If
no bad faults appear the green
light is ahead, and continued
breeding of that ram to his own
progeny will reduce the vari-
ability in your flock and bring
them gradually up to the
standard of that ram. If he has
had a good time himself between
lambing and full mouth he will
never get stock better than him-
self or his hereditary make-up.
But he is probably pretty good,
anyway—being from a good
stud. Inbreeding, however, will
fix his type definitely in your
flock, and his inbred progeny
will be highly prepotent for
their particular characteristics.
What we have done is to
ascertain which ram is likely to
get the best stock by the simple
expedient of examining the stock
he gets. The process of progeny-
testing will be continued ad in-
finitum with his progeny—the
rams to keep will be those by
him from his sisters. When we
want to improve still further the
ram to buy is an inbred one
better than our own and prefer-
ably from the original stud. The
variability caused by the out-
cross will then be at a minimum.
Shearing Troubles.
“Both Sides”: “Bungaree”
and “K.Mc.,” in common with
others, are perturbed about the
shearing situation, but there are
other aspects than those raised.
Hotv many of the complainants
have had actual experience, and
do they realise just why shearers
are so loth to engage in the
work? ,
With owners getting anything
from 3s. to 7s. a pound, is it any
wonder shearers want a few con-
cessions such as free meat, fares,
etc.? The complainers generally
have sheep that are tough and
hard to shear or conditions are
bad, and on this account they
don’t have the same shearers
twice.
Since shearers have the power
of speech, they tell one another,
and shearer A finds that, after
all, he can’t come, and so with
B. C, being a bit rough, can’t
get a good shed, so “K.Mc.” gets
him. If the owners had to shear
their own sheep there would be
fewer “cobblers” in the catching-
pens the next year; most of
them would be crossed with the
butcher’s-knife.
The problem of getting
shearers would be simplified if
owners concentrated on a line of
good, plain, easy-cutting sheep
and didn’t go after the last
pound of wool per medium of
the wrinkly leatherneck. These
are the sheep that break the
learner’s heart and make the
good man dodge the sheds where
they abound. If learners are to
be encouraged, this type of
sheep must be eliminated.
Grain Sorghum.
“Outback”: It appears to be
destined to play a big part in
Queensland’s stock industries,
judging, by the progress it has
already made. In the Peak
Downs district of central
Queensland W. Tweedie,
Moonggoo, Capella, expects an
average from his milo crop of
seven bags to the acre, and in
the Muckadilia (Maranoa) dis-
trict H. and E. Perrier, The
Womals, have a crop of begari
which survived the drought and
is now sft. 6in. high. Tweedie
had 80 acres of kalo eaten black
by grubs at the end of March,
but it has made a great recovery
and is now 3ft. 6in. high. He
grazed 150 bullocks* on 120 acres
of milo for six weeks and there
was a further three weeks’ feed
in sight.
Ryecom for Sandhills.
“Mr,”: Trials with ryecorn as
a means of stabilising Mallee
sandhills, conducted by Vic-
torian Department of Agri-
culture in co-operation
with A. J. Wyatt, J. A.
Pryse, J. A, Steele and S.
R. Pearce at Danyo, Tor-
rita, Ouyen, Lascelles and
Walpeup, consisted of
levelling the hilltops,
breaking up hard subsoil,
pulling out stumps and
sowing the area with rye-
corn. A standard seeding
of 451 b. to the acre was
used, with 45 to 601 b. of
super. Occasional un-
manured strips were left
for comparison.
The trials showed that
it was possible to estab-
lish ryecorn on badly-
eroded hills, and demon-
strated that steep sandhills can
be decapped by establishing
cover on the sides and leaving
the top unsown. This eventually
blows off and accumulates in the
cover, enabling the flattened top
to be sown with rye in the fol-
lowing season. The ryecorn
used in the test gave a marked
response to super., as confirmed
by a sample harvesting.
Mistletoe.
“Bill C.”: Destruction by
poisoning or felling of mistletoe-
infested trees would do much
to steady the spread of the pest
in some forest areas. Though
it is risky destroying trees on
a face, many that are attacked
by mistletoe have no commercial
value, such as messmate and
similar trees. Such trees could
be sacrificed en masse in many
C.Q. localities and their removal
would give really useful trees
and pasture grasses a chance to
grow. The mistletoe is a
leisurely growing plant, its
spread is rapid only in those
forest areas where it has been
established for many years, and
where its enormous growths are
bearing a profusion of seed for
birds to scatter.
The C.S.I.R. has failed to find
a parasitic insect capable of
eradicating it, as the lantana-bug
is beating lantana. As for the
possum, it is very far from ex-
tinct in Queensland coastal dis-
tricts, but it is not hampering
the spread of mistletoe. It is
far too fond of “white man’s
tucker” these days—orchard
fruits, vegetables and sugar-cane.
The koala, unfortunately,
nearly extinct.
Telephone Hints.
“Nubis”: If you’re lucky
enough to get one, use insulated
stranded steel wire with a cop-
per core. Dill, DV or DVIII
cable, occasionally obtainable at
“Nit! Here's a John, I TOLD you to Watch the new
speed limit!"
disposals sales, is ideal for the
purpose, the steel strands
(tinned) giving strength and the
copper core conductivity. When
making joints leave an inch of
the insulation on the end of the
cable to prevent the strands
from separating. Reef-knots will
do unless the cables are of
different thicknesses, when *a
sheet bend.is best. If it is not
convenient to solder the joints,
do this: Before tightening the
knot pass a foot of copper
strand through the centre,
tighten, pinch with pliers, then,
using the copper strand, bind the
joint on each side of the knot,
cut off the free insulated ends,
and wrap the joint with insu-
lation-tape. This will stick better
if you remove an inch or so of
the cotton outer covering on the
cable, exposing the rubber insu-
lation.
Perennial Veldt Grass.
“Prof.”: C.S.I.R. Bulletin 227
is a record of experiments
(mainly in W.A.) with perennial
veldt grass, A comparatively
new fodder plant, it has proved
itself superior to anything else
yet tried in the S.A, Mallee. A
native of Southern Africa, it
was accidentally introduced to a
property near Perth, where it
spread rapidly, and was later
distributed to country districts
there and in S.A. and Victoria.
Harvesting the seed is the
biggest problem—less than a
quarter of the seed is recovered
even from single plants har-
vested by hand. The poor fer-
tility and low-seeding rates
(usually 11b. per acre is suffi-
cient) make the grass rather
slow to establish. This fact
seems to explain why some
farmers are disappointed with
the grass. They have sown the
seed one season, and the next,
not seeing anything for their
pains, have ploughed it up and
tried something else, whereas, if
looked for, some plants would
certainly have grown, and,
given another year or two, they
would seed and rapidly fill in
the gaps. The grass can readily
be identified even in the young
stages —the auricles, which clasp
the stem at the point where the
leaf-blade joins the sheath, are
purplish.
Some trouble has been experi-
enced in W.A. in maintaining
the grass under conditions of
heavy stocking—this does not
appear to be the case in S.A.,
though in the lower-rainfall
areas where legumes cannot be
successfully grown in association
there is a tendency for plants to
become tufted with much bare
ground between them. Most
successful associate legume in

be applied above the bite, which
is usually on the foot or leg be-

must be kept awake, but as his
heart will be under great strain
it should not be further bur-
dened by making him walk
around.

wound, a small circle of
punctures should be made about
the spot and permanganate
rubbed in. Spirits may be given

added. Make sure the sufferer
has not been bitten in more than
one spot. Some snakes strike
repeatedly in quick succession,
thus inflicting a number of
wounds. Get medical help as
soon as possible.
Geese.
“Mr.”: Toulouse and Emden
are the two main breeds, but
Emden is preferred by most. It
is the better sitter, the goslings
grow quickly and mature early.
A goose will covey 11 eggs and
turn them herself, but if a
broody hen is 1 used put no more
than four eggs under her and
turn them each day by hand, as
they’re too big for a hen to
manage on her own. The gos-
lings will be out in 30 days, but
won’t need a feed for 36 hours
or so. Make the first meal
breadcrumbs and milk, with
finely-chopped greens, and fol-
low with a daily ration of
barleymeal, ground wheat, pol-
lard and maizemeal, as much as
they will eat without waste.
When ready to top them off
divide the flock into groups of
20 and give them two feeds a
day consisting of oat-pollard,
wheat-, barley- and maizemeal
made into a mash with separated
milk. Greenstuff is essential at
all stages.
Capon Tips.
“T.F.”: Do the birds at two
pounds weight. Cull heavily
first; don’t waste time on runts.
Cull again at 16 weeks and then
monthly, selling the birds that
have red combs and wattles.
Sell the best birds at nine
months. A morning feed of
chaffed greenstuff and the main
meal at night is best; most of
the manure will then be dropped
in the sheds.
Hints for the Farm.
“Ben Acre”: Rust can be re-
moved from small objects by
soaking in spirits of salts for
half an hour or so, and brush-
ing. Rinse both article and brush
in water to prevent corrosion.
The method is especially suit-
able for fine screw threads.
“Bill C.”: Spraying water into
a hen-house to cool it is quite
all right if the place is well-
ventilated, but without a free
circulation of air the atmosphere
is rendered humid. A hot moist
atmosphere will cause collapse
of the poultry from heat ex-
haustion.
“Sarina”: Graziers on the
Darling Downs (Q.) usually rely
on green oats for fattening stock
during the cooler months, but
J. T. Scrymgeour’s stud farm at
Warwick has a patch of Wim-
mera rye as a change this year.
The grass has done well in this
year’s favorable season, but only
further trials will reveal whether
or not it will be worth growing
in place of oats. Scrymgeour is
also a strong advocate of Uro-
chloa (Liverseed) grass for stock
feed, and he makes plenty of hay
with this grass each year.
“Green Ink”: When pulling
down sacks or cases liable to
burst, drop them on to an old
truck tyre (cover), which will
take the jar.,
“C.A.A.”: Laying birds will
eat increased quantities of food
when producing at their peak—
about 2oz. of wheat and 2oz. of
mash ingredients per bifd daily
will be required. Quantities in
heaviest-laying pens may reach
to soz.
“C.S.”: The first all-Aus-
tralian crude-oil tractor was pro-
duced recently in the K.L. Trac-
tors, Ltd., works at Springvale
(Vic.). It is the only tractor
scheduled for production in
Australia which does not con-
tain dollar parts; every com-
ponent being Australian-made
with the exception of several
bearings,, which are British.
Mass production at Springvale
will be in full swing by the new
year, up to the rate of 750 trac-
tors a year. By the middle of
1949 it is proposed that the rate
will be 1000 per year.
“Te Anua”: The Massey Col-
lege (N.Z.) Wool Association
has produced a fine little book-
let, more or less to mark the
college’s 25th anniversary, but
intended to carry on as an
annual. Called “Wool,” it con-
tains valuable statistical, breed-
ing and other information,
primarily for the technical man
but easily followed by practical
farmers. It should be popular.
“R.N.”: Any woolgrower
who hasn’t his copy of “Lucy,”
the story of a wicked female put
out by the Australian Wool
Board, should send his name
and address to the board right
away, “Lucy” is a fast worker
whose morals would shock the
Sydney stage censors.
•
“C.S.”: Accurate surveys are
lacking, but annual losses caused
by soil pests are very high.
Scientists have now discovered a
ne,w fumigant, or gas, which,
when injected into the soil,
vaporises and is lethal to all
soil-inhabiting pests and stimu-
lates the crop. Australians are
using the fumigant in limited
quantities on vegetable and
tomato crops. Tomato yields
have increased from 2171 b, to
4841 b, per plot after the fumi-
gant has been used. Research-
workers of the Shell Co., who
make the D.D. soil fumigant,
are conducting an Australia-
wide survey to determine what
other agricultural crops suffer
major damage by soil pests.
Large quantities of the fumigant,
it is expected, will be used in
the future.

Guy Fawkes Day must have
been the means of saving from
destruction many haystacks and
wooden houses in our district.
We children, knowing nothing
of psychology or arson, had
another explanation of his en-
thusiasm. Someone, sometime,
had begun the story that his in-
terest in Mr. Fawkes was a per-
sonal one; he had himself been
one of the intended victims of
the Gunpowder Plot, and the
annual bonfires enabled him to
commemorate and renew his
triumph over his enemy. I for
one saw no reason to doubt the
story.
As we stood there gazing dis-
consolately at the heap of ashes
one of the Lodge boys came out.
He was grinning.
“Don’t worry,” he told us.
“They haven’t done much
harm.”
“But they’ve burnt the lot. It’s
all gone,” said one of the boys
standing near.
“That’s what they think,”
said young Lodge, “but don’t
you worry. The bonfire’ll be on
just the same.”
The Conwaytown mob hadn’t
had quite thb triumph they sup-
posed. Knowing them of old,
the Lodges, the Halls and other
lads responsible for the building
of the Lodge bonfire had kept
most of their material in reserve.
The pile that had gone up in
flames was only a decoy ; within
half an hour a heap twice as big
had been built up near by and a
guard was watching to see that
no firebug came near.
DY the time it was dark there
*—' was a large crowd gathered
in Lodge’s paddock. At many
points around the town bonfires
were already blazing fiercely,
and the sound of exploding fire-
works could be heard from all
points of the compass. We kids
were impatient for our own
show to begin, but we knew that
nothing could be done about it
until old Lodge was ready. The
old chap had strong views on
the proper time for lighting a
bonfire. Others could waste
their fires on dusk and semi-
daylight ; his must wait till pitch
darkness allowed it to blaze
forth in greater glory.
At last the great moment
arrived. We saw a glare in the
Lodge backyard. It came
through the fence and moved
steadily towards us, resolving it-
self into a flaming torch borne
by Mr. Lodge. We moved aside
to let him pass through. Hold-
ing the torch on high, he walked
once round the pyre, then bent
down and applied it to the straw
at the bottom of the heap. As
the straw burst into flame he
darted round to the other side
and lit that. Twice more he
thrust his torch into the straw,
then he swung it around his head
in a flaming arc and hurled it up
on top of the pile.
We yelled and cheered like
mad, drawing back a little from
the heat of the already blazing
bonfire. The lighting ceremony
performed, old Lodge stepped
back to busy himself with the
distribution of fireworks.
Once the bonfire was well
alight everyone seemed bent on
letting off his own fireworks as
quickly as possible. Crackers,
cannons and double-bungers
were soon exploding on all
sides; Catherine - wheels,
Roman - candles and more
elaborate pieces were living their
brief moment of glory to the
accompaniment of delighted
oohs and ahs of admiration, and
every kind of yell and shriek
known to the young of the
human species. My sister and I
soon got rid of our small stock
of crackers and began moving
around among the crowd where*
ever the fun was thickest.
The Hall boys had a kerosene-
case containing the fruits of the
morning’s pilgrimage. We
peeped in and saw every con-
ceivable kind of firework and,
topping the lot, six whacking
great rockets.
“We’re saving those till the
end,” said Rupert as he fished
out a string of crackers, to
fasten on to the guy which was
still perched in the billycart.
“They’re beauts —all different
colors.”
Mr. Lodge was coming our
way, distributing largesse, so I
hopped in for my cut. He gave
me a generous double-handful
—my sister also—so we were
well occupied for the next
quarter of an hour. By then I
was again cleaned out. My
sister had a jumping-jack left.
“Better let me light it,” I said,
but she insisted on doing it her-
self.
A FTER wasting three matches
she managed to get the wick
to splutter, then with a shriek
threw the thing from her. It
landed just behind my enemy,
the Halls’ kangaroo-dog, who
had just sauntered up to watch
proceedings. Hearing the
splutter, he turned round to in-
vestigate, and was just in time
to get the benefit of the first ex-
plosion. Where the second and
third jumps took the jack I have
no idea; during the next half-
minute there was too much to
watch for me to worry about a
little thing like that. At the bang
Splinter almost threw himself
over backwards, and in doing so
collided with Mr. Lodge. This
would not have mattered so
much if the old man had still
been engaged in giving out
crackers, or even if he had
merely been standing admiring
the blaze and chanting songs
about Guy Fawkes, but unfor-
tunately he was -in the act of
lighting a skyrocket. He had,
in fact, just lit it and was rising
to his feet when Splinter crashed
into him. Caught off balance,
he fell on the rocket just as it
was leaving the ground. The
bump diverted it so that instead
of describing a graceful parabola
it merely shot along about a
foot off the ground. Roly Hall
saw it coming and flung him-
self aside. He needn’t have
worried ; the rocket wasn’t look-
ing for him. Its goal was the
Hall boys’ case of fireworks.
The glory of the next couple
of minutes was something to be
talked about for years. There
were youngsters who claimed
afterwards that they could dis-
tinguish in the flare-up particu-
lar types of fireworks—flower-
pots, mines-of-serpents, fiery-
fountains and so on—but I don’t
claim that. All I remember is a
furnace of multicolored flame
cascading sparks in all direc-
tions, a farrago of deafening re-
ports, and from the midst of it
all half a dozen glorious rockets
burning their way to the stars.
When relative quiet returned
old Lodge came over to console
the Hall boys and offer them the
rest of his own supply.
“You should be proud of
yourselves,” he told them. “Most
magnificent display I’ve ever
seen. Magnificent! No other
word for it. You’ll remember
this all your life.”
He was right, too. Ever after-
wards that particular Guy
Fawkes night was distinguished
from all others as “the time the
Hall boys’ cracker-box went
up.” Roly and Rupert weren’t
exactly pleased at the time, but
later on you’d have thought they
had arranged the whole thing,
they were so proud of it.
Old Lodge caught sight of
their guy, lolling back there in
the billycart.
“Ah! You’ve caught old
Guido,” he said. “Time we put
him on, isn’t it?”
Roly supposed it was.
“Bring him forward, then,”
commanded old Lodge. Turn-
ing towards the fire he cupped
his hands and shouted “All guys
forward. Bring on your guys.”
At this the Hall boys and all
others possessing guys brought
them close to the fire, forming a
ring around it. Lodge’s own
sons brought forward a magnifi-
cent effigy, which the old boy
took in his arms. He held the
dummy up above his head and
chanted, the whole, concourse
joining in. •
Guy Fawkes, Guy,
Chuck him up high,
Chuck him on the bonfire
• And there let him die.
At the third line he hurled
the effigy into the flames, and
those holding the other guys
followed his example. There
were many of them, and the
flames sank back for a space be-
fore bursting out in renewed
fury. Crackers and hungers in
the pockets of the guys spat de-
fiance at the revellers for a few
moments, then the flames really
took charge and the guys were
soon reduced to ashes.
Old Lodge watched their de-
struction with undisguised glee.
When it was complete he stepped
back and called for three cheers
—whether for the King or for
Guy Fawkes I cannot say. They
were given heartily, he bade the
assembly good-night and de-
parted.
With his going the show really
came to an end. It did not take
the revellers long to get rid of
the rest of their ammunition;
presently the fire collapsed, and
soon it would be merely a heap
of glowing coals and smoulder-
ing ashes. The crowd began to
disperse.
ON the way home my sister
said “I’ve got a good idea.
We’ll go up there early in the
morning. There’ll be lots of
crackers and things on the
ground. People drop them and
can’t see them in the dark.”
I agreed it would be a good
plan.
We got there early all right.
So did the Halls and the Lodges
and the Coopers and the Shaws.
But none of us found much. The
Flannagans, who didn’t believe
in Guy Fawkes, had been there
earlier still.

His pulse quickened as the
fire’s glow threw her luscious
profile in effigy against the
Bunnerong blackout. Above,
the two - volt mantel - model

courage he said boldly;

“How’s that?” she broke in

He shook his head, and for a
moment there was a silence that
seemed like a century. As he
threw her a leg glance he saw
her long eyelashes curl in disdain
upon her rosy cheeks.
“Yes?” he interjected hope-
fully as she slipped him her
hand.
“It’s now over,” she went on.
He slumped dejectedly in his

mustn’t do his block. “I hope

thought. There must be a

As he pulled up outside a
fashionable hotel and got out
the president of the Commo-
controlled Winch-winders and
Joggle-spreaders’ Union turned
and viewed the car with the
scowl which came so nfaturally
to him. And no wonder! Why,
it was one of those old ’46
models and was already slightly
losing its pristine glow. He
shuddered as he glanced at the
mascot on the bonnet —a minia-
ture Statue of Liberty, and it
was, of course, a high-priced
American car. That symbol was
anathema to any Communist.
Having enjoyed a five-course
meal, with the best spirituous
embellishments, the champion of
the proletariat repaired to the
palatial union h.q. There he
found the assistant-secretary, a
late recruit to the ranks of the
party.
“Charter me a special plane
for Canberra for tomorrow,
"I'll finish telling you when Mr. Harris has swiped
his soup.”
Comrade,” growled the presi-
dent. “I’ve got some demands
to make on the Government,
and on past performances we
can’t miss.” •
“Why aren’t you going by
car. Comrade?” asked the asst.-
sec. “Are you getting short of
petrol-coupons?”
The president stared at his
subordinate. “Are you goin’
dopy?” he asked tersely, a scowl
on his humorless face. Then he
dived his hand into his pocket
and tossed on the table a heap
of five- and 10-gallon tickets.
“You ought to know we get as
many as we want, an’ more. As
political philosophers ’oos job it
is to foment strikes, clog-up in-
dustry an’ cause as much misery
among the workers as we can,
all necessary to prepare for the
revolootion, we’re entitled to
special consideration—an’ it ain’t
ever missin’. I’m goin’ by plane
because the car don’t ride smooth
enough for long trips. Besides,
I don’t like the style of the
cigar-lighter, and, anyway, I
want one with a built-in cock-
tail-bar. Fill in an application-
form for fourteen noo cars for
the use o’ the union—the best
American models, o’ course —
money’s no object.”
“What about priorities, Com-
rade?”
The president again stared at
this tyro in Commo-run union
affairs. “Don’t be batty alto-
gether!” he growled. “Whadda
we want to bother about priori-
ties for? I just say I want ’em
an’ I get ’em. Dollars don’t
matter a hoot —not to us.”
“Wouldn’t it be more patriotic
for us to import Soviet-made
cars, Comrade?” asked the new
convert, like all converts fanati-
cal in his enthusiasm.
This time the president flew
off the handle so far as to be
blasphemous. “For Stalin’s
sake shut up!” he roared. “Do
y’ think a man wants to git a
floatin’ liver? Our admiration
for the Soviet way of existence
don’t run to havin’ to jolt
around in one o’ them things!
Besides, the ’ole o’ the Soviet’s
production o’ the people’s car is
reserved for party officials —you
oughta know that!”
“But our union funds are low.
Comrade. We haven’t got
enough for strike-pay, and we’ll
have to depend on levies com-
pulsorily struck by other unions
run by our party to keep us
going. Where will we get the
money to pay for the cars?”
The president raised his cold,
eyes to the ceiling before fasten-
ing them on this obvious dull-
witted a,-s. “Where do you
think we’ll get the money?
From the same source that we
get paid to keep strikes goin’
an’ for our propaganda, o’
course!”
Light at last dawned on the
a.-s. “Oh, I see! ” exclaimed this
newcomer to Communist, affairs.
Then he cryptically stroked an
imaginary handle-bar moustache,
glanced up reverently at a huge
photo, of Uncle Joe on the wall
and, leaping up, raised the
clenched fist.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4£d. per line; all others 2 id. per line.
Savings Bank Deposits
Total savings bank balances in Aus-
tralia have reached the amazing figure of
£683,573,000—£22 million more than at
the same date in 1947.
A commercial journal attributes the
rise to higher wages, but the popular
opinion that savings banks are used
mainly by the wage-earning class is out
of date. When the State Savings Bank of
Victoria was established, its purpose was
stated to be encouragement of thrift
among artisans, mechanics and laborers.
That was also very largely the reason for
establishing other sayings banks, which
catered for the working classes of those
days by accepting as little as Is., and by
keeping open on Saturdays or other late-
shopping nights to receive wage-earners’
deposits.
All that was very commendable, but
those banks have drifted a long way from
their original purpose. They are now
used very widely by all classes of the
community as though they were trading
banks; by the opening of joint accounts,
trust accounts, etc., and by customers
doing business with more than one sav-
ings bank, the maximum figure on which
interest may be paid has beeh defeated.
Interest rates paid for these huge de-
posits, which are to all intents and pur-
poses payable on demand, are higher than
the trading banks are permitted to pay
for deposits fixed for two years. The
result, of course, is that many depositors
are drawing out their fixed deposits and
transferring them to savings banks.
It is not a good thing to have a vast
sum like £683 million bearing interest
and payable at call. Memories of the
Government Savings Bank of N. S. Wales
are still fresh.
No great harm could come so long as
the original intention of these banks was
adhered to — i.e., thrift accounts for wage-
earners —but the position is very different
now. The matter should be carefully
examined. Proper banking practice was
evolved and adopted for very good
reasons and should not be departed from.
Much of the money should be “fixed”
with the savings banks themselves —that
was recommended by the Royal Com-
mission on Banking in 1936, and if the
recommendation was sound then, how
much more so it is today.— Nugget
(Vic.).
Profit-sharing
Workers themselves, union-members
mainly, are forcing more and more of
their leaders either to agree to incentive-
production schemes or to turn a blind
eye on plants where bonus schemes are
operating. The schemes are worked out
under a score of variations, some on in-
dividual bases, some on group bases,
some on piecework and some by con-
tract. All, however, when full co-opera-
tion exists between management and em-
ployee, result in better relations, higher
production and bigger pay envelopes,
A new scheme, known after its inven-
tor as the Rucker Share-of-Production
Plan, and outlined in latest American
magazines, is likely to find favor in this
country. Rucker was called in by 4 a
medium-sized American paper firm after
months of industrial bickering had cost
the company up to nearly 50 per cent,
wage increases.
Analysing the company’s accounts for
the five immediate pre-war years, Rucker
found that wages earned
equalled just over 30 per cent,
of what workers added to the
value of raw material. That
is, if one "dollar’s worth of
raw material produced an
article worth two dollars, 30
cents of that 100 per cent,
turnover went in wages.
Although not a set figure in
any industry, the amount
never varied more than one-
half of 1 per cent, in any
one year of the company’s accounts.
A conference between management
and union-leaders cleared the way for
introducing a wage scheme based on
Rucker’s research. Here is the result of
the first 44 weeks of the plan’s operation:
The company provided £ 1,500,000-worth
of raw material, supplies and spares.
Workers made these into more than
£3,000,000-worth of paper and board.
Thirty per cent, of this added value was
nearly £500,000, three-quarters of which
was paid in weekly wages, based on a
scale written into a contract. The bal-
ance was split three ways—a quarter into
a reserve fund, half the remainder for
insurance pensions and the remainder
shared in proportion to earnings among
all employees every four weeks.
The reserve fund is drawn upon
should workers not equal the minimum
pay scale, but twice a year this, too, is
closed and shared among employees, half
in cash and half in pensions. If there is
a deficit the company must absorb it.
With its 70 per cent, share the firm
meets salaries, holiday pay, taxes, com-
pensation, administration and other trad-
ing expenses, with anything over becom-
ing profit. On this result the plan has a
great future. Workers get a share of the
values they create, not just a share of
profits. It’s up to the management to
make a profit out of what’s left. —

“Good Old Days”
So people nowadays haven’t anything
to complain about as regards living con-
ditions? In All My Yesterdays the late
Ernest Wunderlich wrote thus of the
Sydney he settled in in 1885:
There were no taxes to speak of, and
no trade-union tyranny. Living was rid-
iculously cheap, a lamb 2s. 6d., good table
wine 2s. 6d. a gallon, imported beer 2d.
and stout 9d. a bottle, honey 601 b. tin
12s. 6d. Orchards in most suburbs pro-
vided fruits fresh from the trees. These
orchards, have ceased to exist, and today
we have to be content with fruit packed
when green, which has ripened in cold
storage. At the Diner de Paris, one could
get three courses, with wine and coffee in-
cluded, for Is. 6d. There were many res-
taurants offering good dinners from 6d.
to 9d
Major Jarvis, in his autobiography,
Half a Life, writes of havipg a good two-
course meal, with unlimited meat, for 6d.
in Sydney in 1898. He also says Sydney
stevedores then earned nearly £1 a day.
In Moore’s The Story of Australian
Art mention is made of Melbourne artists
in the ’nineties, dining at Fasoli’s, where
a good dinner with wine ad lib. and cafe
noir cost Is. At a wine shop in the Royal
Arcade, a mug of hot spiced wine was
3d. Tony Kanake’s provided steak and
eggs and accessories for 6d.
And here’s a glimpse of living condi-
tions in Sydney in the 1900’s, from a
housewife’s letter to a Sydney newspaper:
Thirty years ago we paid 7d. per lb. for
rump steak, 4£d. for loin chops and blade,
for sausages, 3d. for 41b. of onions or
potatoes, 6d. a yard for good prints, Is. 6d.
“Put her on half an hour , Bill — I Want to get away
early today.”
to 2s. 6d.Tor voiles. Now material is up to
17s. 6d. a yard. At that time my husband
was getting £3 10s. a week, and I was
better off than now at £B. We had a large,
five-roomed house for 15s. a week, and all
to ourselves, too.
These days, in any good middle-class
suburb, one can find plenty of houses that
are grossly overcrowded, through married
children or close relatives being unable
to find places of their own. There was
nothing like that in the ’nineties, except,
perhaps, in the slums. The young clerk,
shop assistant or artisan of those days
had a house ready for his bride —there
was a wide choice at a reasonable rent.
Within the last 50 years there has been
substantial increase in production. The
average family is smaller and people
generally marry later. Therefore, there
should be a much higher standard of
living. Yet it is doubtful if most of what
luxuries the average household enjoys
could be afforded but for the extended
credit system. That development is
making debt a national habit, and a social
structure built on debt is built on sand. —
Economist (N.S.W.).
The Jury
In N. S. Wales, from January 1 next
year, witnesses in Supreme Courts,
Quarter Sessions, Petty Sessions and
Coroner’s Courts will receive 255. a day
—an increase of 9s. Four hours’
attendance will be worth 155., and wit-
nesses attending all-day sittings will re-
ceive 3s. 6d. for a meal, plus sustenance
allowance if they are away from home
overnight.
What about jurors? They are com-
pelled to serve, often against their will,
for 14s. a day. Witnesses can leave the
Court and buy their own meals, whereas
jurors are fed in the building and have
to take what they are given. If the case
is not finished in one, two or more days
the witness goes home or to his hotel;
jurors at a Criminal Court sitting are
locked up overnight in anything but com-
fort —high old-fashioned Austrian chairs
to sit on, lino, on the floor which is
bitterly cold in winter and a huge room
about 50ft. by 25ft. with a 20ft. ceiling.
Beds and bedding are all right, but the
showers are at the back in an open court-
yard. One experience of them in mid-
winter was enough for me.
Recently T sat on a murder case. For
dinner we were given one small leg of
mutton for 12 men, with half a cup of
vegetables each and two slices of bread.
For dessert there were stewed apples and
custard, about one spoonful of each per
man. The tea was almost undrinkable.
The jury retired to consider their verdict
at 3.30 p.m. No agreement was reached
by 5 p.m., so we had tea —one tin of
herrings and half a loaf of bread with
less than |lb. butter among the 12 of us.
We rang for the Sheriff’s Officer and
asked for more food, especially bread and
something to eat with it. He returned
with another half-loaf and some butter
and the information that there was
nothing else, as the caterer thought the
case would finish and did not prepare
an evening meal.
Something will have to be done about
these conditions before next year, when
women will be serving on juries.— Juror
(N.S.W.).
Radio Aids
Despite “Luke’s” assertion, high-
frequency direction-finding stations have
had their day and another decade will
see the end of them. Their only use is
on long trans-ocean hops where very-
high-frequency direction-finding is im-
practical because of its limited range.
Agreed that during electrical storms
near the aircraft the effect on the
h.f.-d.f. cathode-ray oscilloscope at the
ground station is negligible, but no matter
how expert the radio operator he can’t
hear the d.f, stations give their bearings
above the crackle of lightning in the
’phone.
The true value of h.f.-d.f. has been
realised both by the R.A.A.F. and D.C.A.
Both agree it was good in its day—lo
years ago —when there was no better and
v.his., because of the absence of high-
insulating plastics and ceramics, were
only a dream.
Although the h.f.-d.f. system can
operate over a wide area, this is no
advantage—the errors, always prevalent,
are commensurate with distance. Some-
times the bearings are 50 miles out.
“Luke’s” claim that wireless air-gunners
knew nothing of h.f.-d.f. is wrong. Be-
fore “passing out” all w.a.gs.
were proficient in the use of
h.f.-di., and if their O.T.U.
(operational training unit) in-
structors were keen the young
air-crew soon became expert.
I spent six years in an
R.A.A.F. cockpit. Had
“Luke” been on my right he
would have as little faith as
I and thousands of other
skippers did in this outmoded
radio aid to navigation. When
lost I would much sooner rely on my
natural sense of direction than the
h.f.-d.f., especially at last light.
The only solution in this country is
radio-telephone v.h.f.-d.f. stations above
lOOm.c. (about two metres) operating
throughout the Commonwealth. Their
accuracy and complete freedom from
static has forced D.C.A. to begin their
installation on the Darwin-Adelaide run
—the Director of Civil Aviation, Air
Vice-Marshal Williams, said lately that
the v.h.f.-d.f. between Adelaide and Dar-
win would make it the safest route in
Australia. • .
R.A.A.F. fighter pilots owe their lives
to v.h.f.-d.f., which always got them
safely home if they were lost after a
dogfight. When a number of Mosquitoes
left England for America recently,
v.h.f.-d.f. stations on ships along the
route kept them on course.
Morse code has been replaced almost
exclusively by r.t., and, with the gradual
but certain introduction of v.hi.-d.f.,
aircraft radio operators are a dying race
especially over land routes. Give me
v.h.f.-d.f. and a good second pilot and
I’d fly round the world with the utmost
confidence. — Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).
Country Population
When the 1947 census was taken every
State had less rural population than in
1933. Electoral rolls show that the
greatest drift has occurred since 1940.
What a comment on “Labor’s” de-
centralisation policy!
“Labor” retorts that as farms become
mechanised less rural manpower is needed
and surplus workers and their families
drift to the capital cities. The stark facts
are that, for want of labor and materials,
farm fences and buildings have not been
in a worse state of disrepair for a quarter
of a century, and thousands more hands
are needed to fight soil erosion.
In 1945 Fadden warned that the drift
of both men and soil from the land was
resulting in a serious loss in the pro-
duction of food. Half the netting fences
are no longer rabbit-proof, and a wave of
cottontails is creating havoc on pastures
and crops.
A correspondent of “S. M. Herald” cal-
culates that 185,000 people migrated from
127 rural shires in N.SW. between
1933 and 1947. This means that farms
and rural villages have lost 27.7 per cent,
of their 1933 population. Even 85
country municipalities suffered a net loss
of 9914 between the two census years.
It is decentralisation in reverse. —F. D.
(N.S.W.).
Vets.
The Victorian Government’s parsimony
in not endowing a chair of veterinary
science at Melbourne University has
brought much criticism from farmers,
particularly in the Wimmera and Western
districts. The dearth of qualified veterin-
arians is such that those two highly pro-
ductive wheat, sheep and dairying areas,
extending over hundreds of square miles,
boast only two experienced officers and
two stock inspectors. When sheep and
cattle deaths occur, sometimes from
mysterious causes, expert assistance may
not arrive before there are further heavy
losses.
Although there are 300 students in
the veterinary course at Sydney Univer-
sity only 50 are in their final year, and
of those 26 will return to Maoriland.
Some of the remainder will go to other
States and of those who return to Vic-
toria many will be won over to private
enterprise, which offers better conditions
than the Government, Plain Aus-
tralian (Vic.).
Federal Election
The R.S.L. has about 350,000 members
and intends to line them up against the
Chifley Government if it does not give
ex-servicemen a fair deal on pensions.
The Australian Automobile Association
has over 300,000 members in its State
constituent bodies and intends to cam-
paign against the Government if it does
not disgorge more of the petrol tax for
roads. These bodies combined represent
a substantial voting power and have the
ear of the public.
Here, then, is a double chance for the
Liberal and Country parties to come out
with definite proposals. Vague generali-
ties and promises are no use,, but a
detailed policy would gain thousands of
votes. — Motorist (S.A.).
Shearers f
“K. Me.” says (B. 13/10/’4B) that
“graziers who complain about shearers
are not far wrong.” Sometimes shearers
who complain about graziers aren’t far
wrong either.
It’s noticeable that year after year the
same stations are in trouble while others
never have any. For well over 30 years
I’ve owned a medium-sized property with
over 10,000 sheep, and I’ve never had
trouble. Generally, I’m sorry when shear-
ing is over, as I enjoy having a decent
body of men around me. The different
teams of shearers and shedhands I’ve had
have been as decent as men in any other
industry—better than some I know of.
I know there is often a troublemaker
in a team, but if the rest are all right he
doesn’t get much of a following. Un-
fortunately, some “bosses” don t know
how to speak to or treat men, and some
men don’t know how to treat the boss
either, as a hostile feeling has been bred
into them—a relic of the 1890 strikes.
At my last shearing I had a splendid
team who, when the cut-out came,
gathered around for a drink ,with the


beautiful cascade-like effect with the de-
scending passages from the extreme limits
of the head register. Her phrasing and
tone control were excellent. The flexi-
bility of her voice was never better ex-
emplified than in the Mar tern aller Arten.
The orchestra was in fine fettle in a
programme which included Mozart’s
Symphony No. 40, K 550, and Beethoyen's
Eighth. Its most inspired playing of the
season went into the fascinating rhythm
of the Allegretto Scherzando which
Beethoven substituted for the usual slow
movement, and the Minuet which fol-
lowed—Beethoven again cutting across
the tradition he himself had established'
with the invention of the third movement
Scherzo and going back to the Mozartian
grace of his first two symphonies—was

For three days they sailed under a
sKorching sun, w.n.w. for Diego Garcia,
The position, with prospects of an early
landfall, was hopeful, and all hands bore
up well. Just before dawn of the fourth
day the bow lookout sighted a craft of
some description to port. Deciding that
if it were a submarine they would soon
be sighted anyway, a torch was flashed.
The other boat drew closer; it was No.
3 lifeboat, with the third mate in charge
and carrying a Dutch sea captain, a pas-
senger in Nellore.
The mate, who had a sextant, was con-
fident they should soon raise land ; and
when a Catalina was sighted just before
sunset they could be excused for believ-
ing their troubles were over—instead of
just beginning. At dawn next day the
extra lookouts posted in anticipation of
a landfall reported an island ahead.
Both boats saw it. In the flood of rosy
dawnlight the island was a thing of
beauty. White rifts of sand sparkled
like tinsel. Above the beach palm-trees
swayed under the gentle suasion of the
s.e trades. And as the sun lifted up the
veil of horizon clouds it lifted their
island-mirage with them.
Most of that day both boats lav be-

But though the Catalina dropped them

day dawned. Surely, the mute eyes of
the natives huddled forrard asked the

cunningly resisted the new master, chal-

Losing the other boat, they careered
before the storm, and from their running
position the sea looked like an immense
waterfall, one enormous roaring mass of
foam. Occasionally, from out of this
terrible cataract, a Himalayan sea would

her and jolt her skyward,

Almost every day thereafter brought
one or two deaths, from exposure or
drinking saltwater. One man was caught
stealing water with a lifebelt with two
tubes, one of which dipped into the
breaker while he sucked the precious
stuff through the other. His water ration
was stopped for one* issue. »
On the 14th day a rain-squall deluged
a life-giving stream of rain into the belly
of the mainsail, and by nightfall all
hands had drunk their fill. The rain had
beaten the'sea down, but with its passing
the grey troughs of tumbling brine once
more reared their wind-whipped crests
behind them.
Next day, after the wind had keened
their rain-soaked bodies all night:
The Dawn is always the worst —but this
is our darkest dawn. This is not a boat —
it’s a morgue. Nine dead —the living and
the dead together. Rigor mortis has set
in. Will have trouble to get some of the
dead over the side, as some are in awful
positions.
Every man, like every rope, has his
breaking-strain, and those left alive had
almost reached theirs. They were begin-
ning to die ; they yearned for rest and
warmth with an intensity almost fatal to
their will.
The boat was badly strained by her
incessant battering, and all spare hands
were constantly bailing, except the
Javanese woman, who was nursing the
naval gunner and her own sick husband.
Then, on the 27th day, with the
weather at last moderating;
This morning, the woman’s husband
died. We are all so sorry. She breaks
down for the first time. She who has been
so brave —never complaining, never asking
for a thing, unless it was for her children,

to console her the best we can, but she
just sobs arid cuddles her children. Sail
this day in sadness—hearing the woman
cry.
Just after midnight Litster thought he
heard a motor-ship. They listened with
painful intentness. It was not a ship, but
the long rollers of the Indian Ocean
pouring themselves on to the beaches of
Madagascar!
They at once beat about and clawed
off the coast till daylight, sailing north
all day until the smoke of a village was
sighted, about 6 p.m. Then, with life-
belts on, the run-in through the surf to
safety began.
They were on the second-last breaker
when the tiller snapped. But the sea had
finished with them. The surf took her,
swung her sideways and violently cast
her on to the rippled sand. The sea-
boat’s long journey had ended.
Within 10 minutes natives of the
village, which was called Zimbave,
sighted their rockets and carried them to
a near-by French settlement, the in-
habitants of which fed and nursed the
emaciated crew. A plane sent from
Tananarive took them all, except the
baby girl, who died on the second day
ashore, south to hospital in Diego
Suarez.

austere servitude of the sea had taken a
grim toll, the survivors had in them the

A National Trust
The gift to the S.A. Government by
Sir James Gosse of thousands of acres at
the Coorong brings up once more the
need of a National Trust. A condition
of the gift is that experiments be carried
out on the land to combat soil erosion
and rehabilitate the land to what it was
a century ago—as depicted in a painting
showing plenty of plant growth at that
time.
The Government readily accepted the
gift, but can it carry out the condition?
It is a feature of all Governments that
work outside the ordinary gets marooned
in departmental bywaters; finance is
usually niggardly or lacking; and the
initial wave of enthusiasm slowly sub-
sides until the scheme lapses.
A National Trust would ensure that
gifts of land, money and properties of
historic interest or value received ade-
quate administration and attention. ’ Its
formation should prove no problem, and
generous donors and the public would
know that gifts were accepted and treated
with every consideration. — Honourit
(S.A.).
The Root of the Matter
“M.R.” (B. 20/10/’4B) stated that the
“Royal College of Nursing has expressed
‘satisfaction’ ” with new rates of pay for
nurses. It has been officially announced
by the Royal Victorian College of Nurs-
ing Employees’ Association that it would
continue to fight for higher salaries for
women. In reply to criticism by the
Hospital Nurses’ Board, the Association
explained that it was not admitting that
male employees have, or will have, any
more skill than females now in the pro-
fession ; but it has to be guided by the
fact that in our economic life male wages
are made up differently from female
wages. The Association drew special
attention to this fact, because nurses feel
that salaries are still too low. The claim
for equal pay for the sexes has not been
dropped—merely left in abeyance for a
while. — Sister X. (Vic.).
The Food for Britain campaign is fall-
ing far short of its goal. Australia’s food
exports to Britain, instead of increasing,
have dropped considerably over the last
10 years. In 1938 we exported £46 million
sterling of foodstuffs to Britain—more
than any other country in the world. In
1947 this dropped to £45 million sterling,
at a time when the pound was worth less
than half of its pre-war value. New
Zealand, on the other hand, nearly
doubled the value of its exports to Britain,
while Canada, the U.S.A. and Argentina
trebled theirs. Australia is now only fifth
on the list. — Karuah (N.S.W.).
The P.M.G.’s announcement that his
department will consider building homes
in country centres is good news for hun-
dreds of employees who have been
forced to remain in the city and refuse
promotion because of lack of housing in
the country. The Police Department
might well follow the P.M.G.’s example.
The expansion of the department in Vic-
toria has been hampered both by the
dearth of policemen and the unwilling-
ness of married members of the force to
go to country towns where homes are
not available.— Plain Australian (Vic,).
“Sorry, Dad!”
Contemporary Art.
The Contemporary Art Society is hold-
ing its tenth annual inter-State show in
Sydney’s Education Department Gallery,
whose hospitable walls are hung with all
kinds of paintings—3oo or so —reflecting
all manner of influences and all sorts of
artistic manners —from Donald Friend’s
“Venus and Adonis” to R. Emerson
Curtis’s “Mount Morgan,” through a
maze of “abstract” paintings and draw-
ings, and then back to H. McCiintock’s
“Aspects of Life in a Modern City.”
McCHntock seems determined to depict
the grimy side of life, which wouldn’t be
so bad if he drew character and drama
out of it. But his “Aspects” (a dim study
of a shadowy figure against a dingy back-
ground) and his “Group of Philosophers”
(a collection of aged men in conversation)
stop just on the dull edge of the
grotesque, giving one that hopeless feel-
ing which comes from staring at mile
after mile of uniform slum dwellings
through a grimy train window, with, as
it were, an irritating grain of soot in
one eye.
To do McClintock justice there are not
sufficient of his paintings in the exhibi-
tion to account for this invincible re-
pugnance—it comes, probably, from the
miles of slums painted by contemporary
artists, and the chain or so exhibited at
the Education Department Gallery. And
it is very likely that McCHntock de-
liberately set out to produce some feeling
of the sort. Which, it cannot be suffi-
ciently emphasised, is not art, whatever
its social uses. If it were one need only
reproduce a sufficient quantity of rusted
iron to be a first-class painter.
Margaret Olley, whose work has shown
a certain struggling strength in the past,
leans towards the slum technique in her
“Ipswich Hotel,” as do some dozens of
others.
There is color in Margo Lewer’s
“Marine Growth” and “Coral Growth,”
and both color and composition in R.
Emerson Curtis’s “Mount Morgan”—a
panoramic view of mountain and roadside
with a clear light and small, dramatic
touches in the human figures, antlike at
the base.
Mary M. Ellis’s “Portrait of B. E.
Mansfield” is large and has vitality and
character, with some uncertainty of tech-
nique. A small painting, “Joan,” by
Henry Simms, shows the mobile face of a
young woman with warm dark eyes and
a suggestion of flaming hair. Too small
and sketchy to be seriously considered
as a test of the artist’s capacity, it is a
pleasant and vital little painting.
C. G. Taylor’s “Ruins, Cox’s Home,
Mulgoa,” is another small picture. The
ruins are seen as warm thumbnails of
light in a rich pastoral setting of field and
cows, with sharp, meticulous detail in the
slight and pleasant scene.
George Duncan’s “A Berrima Orchard”
is pleasant and slight; his “For Thine Is
the Kingdom” is large, sombre, with a
fine harmony within its stylised pattern
and nuances of darkness and low-toned
colors, and —because of the rigidity of
the pattern—an irresistible resemblance
to a large, dark, rich lamington.
Sidney Nolan’s “Cooktown” is a flat
pattern of ugly township and ugly green
bay. “The Licensee” is more interesting
and vigorous—a large painting of flat
brown earth and a blue varnished sky,
with a building bearing the caption, “J.
Sheehan —Agricultural Hotel,” balanced
between sky and the single human figure
in the foreground. It is not unlike a
Drysdale painting, with more breadth and
humor in it.
R. Loudon’s “Also the Hills” is an un-
yielding pattern of hills and fields, under
a clear light. His “Mt. Woolooma” has
the rigidity of pattern, but here it is
balanced by the roughness of timber in
the background, and by a vitality which
counterbalances a roughness of paint.
