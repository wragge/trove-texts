ONE MORE
WEEK
SUITABLE MATERIAL
THE IMMIGRATION DEPART-
MENT is accepting the severe British
budget as an ill wind which is blowing
more people our way. However, al-
though many studies in patterns of
immigration have been done, no one,
it seems, has yet worked out if the
immigrants who come here from Britain
in the wake of her recurring crises are
not the most likely to return home,
disgruntled.
Now might be just the time to begin
a study on this. It is tempting to believe
that the sort of person who leaves his
homeland because he has to pay two-
pence more for his cigarettes is exactly
the sort of person least likely to settle
down easily elsewhere.
VOICES FROM THE SOUTH
IN OUR MORE gloomy moments
about the state of affairs in South Aus-
tralia we have been wondering about
what sacrifices we will have to make if
sanctions are imposed against the State
until democratic government is restored.
We feel democracy is worth a stick of
celery.
However, things haven’t quite come
to that yet, and there is plenty of evi-
dence that not everyone in South Aus-
tralia is happy with the present state of
affairs.
Mass meetings, protesting about un-
equal electoral boundaries, have gained
bigger attendances than many Adelaide
Festival events, and some of them have
been a good deal livelier.
A meeting in Light Square was at-
tended by some 10,000 people, and Mr.
Don Dunstan said later it was the big-
gest political demonstration in South
Australia for some 50 years.
The temperature was in the sultry
nineties, and along with the more typi-
cal political activists were family par-
ties and elderly women with folding
chairs, ice-boxes, sunshades, giving the
early stage of the afternoon a sedate
suburban flavor, and also indicating how
wide the sympathies for Mr. Dunstan’s
position had spread. Then Adelaide
writer and book-seller Max Harris
climbed on to the party truck, and a
pause ensued as he looked for some-
where to put his cane. Finally laying it
on the floor, he opened with “Citizens,
fellow South Australians, and (pause)
Andrew P. Jones” (laughter, cheers).
He went on t o say that “eggheads
should also be political realists” (slight
applause), that he would be the first
person-to “jump on Don Dunstan” if he
found that power corrupted him in the
way it had the Playford Government
(awkward light clapping), that so far
he couldn’t “even throw a pebble at
Donnie Boy” (loud cheers), and that
he had a watching brief in South Aus-
tralia for political corruption (cries of
“Good on you, Maxie”).
Splendidly displaying the common
touch of the realist egghead with an
inimitable variety of broad Austra-
lianisms, Harris ended by exhorting
the crowd to “go off and see your
Auntie Fred on Kangaroo Island or in
Millicent, and expose to her the con-
spiracies, the iniquities, of the present
electoral franchise in South Australia
(loud, if uncertain, cheers).”
Don Dunstan followed with language
much less bizarre. He spoke for the
principle of “one vote, one value,” and
taking every tactical point he quoted at
length from statements made by George
Wallace, QC (now President of the
N.S.W. Appeals Court), before the New
South Wales Electoral Boundaries Com-
mission on behalf of the Liberal Party,
and by the now Federal Minister W. C.
Wentworth, also arguing “one vote, one
value” in the House of Representatives.
Mr. Dunstan pointed out that with
the Liberal Party’s present plan for
redistribution in effect, it could govern
with only thirty-eight percent of the
popular vote, five percent less than they
received in this month’s elections.
GRACEFUL ENTRANCE
IN CANBERRA the dignity of the
Governor-General’s office is being
maintained by a piece of graceful civil
engineering. Since the middle of last
year his drive home to Yarralumla has
been disturbed by an expressway lead-
ing south into the new Woden Valley
area. He has had to detour up an
expressway ramp, turn sharp right,
proceed across an overbridge, then
very sharp left again, and meander
along the Cotter recreation reserve road
to his own drive.
Now it has been announced that the
expressway is to be extended half a
mile toward the centre of the city.
This project was authorised in the last
Mr. Tirtaamidjaja .. batik entrepreneur
Budget, but when the National Capital
Development Commission came to
announce the start of the work there
was a small, additional structure: a
single-lane flyover which will deposit
the Governor-General more gracefully
at his front door, although Canberra
residents, plagued by traffic jams
closer to the city, might not all have
given this job top priority.
ONLY THE BEST
BATIK, a technique of textile printing,
is an Indonesian art form dating from
the 16th century. But this year it’s tak-
ing on an eminence of another kind,
for it’s been discovered by “Vogue”
and “Harper’s Bazaar.”
Mr. Nusjirwan Tirtaamidjaja, a
batik entrepreneur who has been ex-
hibiting batiks in Melbourne, Canberra,
and Sydney, told us this. Mr. Tirta-
amidjaja is a lively young Indonesian
who’s studied both in England and the
U.S., and whose interest in batik
threatens to take over his other life
as a lecturer in law at the University
of Indonesia. “I am more interested
in art now. You see, in law, you seek
out people’s weaknesses, in art you seek
out their strengths.”
He brought the exhibition to Aus-

You’re moving interstate
So who wants to pay to move an empty van?
You’re shifting to, say, Alice Springs.
Now, unless the removalist who quoted for your
move has a branch in that distant place, his
quote will have to include the expense of get-
ting the empty van back to Melbourne or
Sydney or wherever you moved from.
Not with Wridgways.
Wridgways have the largest network of branches
of any removalist in Australia. Name a place. If
Wridgways don’t have a branch there, at least
it’s on one of their many scheduled routes.
So you never pay to move an empty van. By
back-shipment of goods, Wridgways make sure
every van is full—at no extra cost to anyone.
And, because Wridgways operate scheduled
services, you never have to wait for a big van
to be filled; you move when you want to move.
Almost as fast as moving by air. And whoever
heard of paying to fly an empty airplane back
to base?

PERSONAL
STORAGE
can save
you money
To replace furniture costs money.
To store it is much more economical
than you might think.
So if you’re temporarily without
housing after selling, while build-
ing, overseas or for any other reason
think about storing your belong-
ings.
Wridgways offer Australia’s largest
storage facilities. All under cover.
And at Wridgways it’s Personal
Storage because it’s locked con-
tainer storage. This means that all
your goods are sealed in individual
containers. Well packed. Dust free.
Moth and mildew free. Free from
pilferage.
And private.
You won’t find storage quite this
good anywhere else.
And it costs no more than anywhere
else. Certainly much less than re-
buying.

tralia for Melbourne’s Moomba Festi-
val, but the Craft Association of Aus-
tralia invited him to stay on and ex-
hibit in Sydney at the Cell Block
Theatre. “I am interested in promoting
the finer batiks not those which are
done with the faster ‘tjap’ method,” he
said. “ ‘Tjap’ is done by stamping the
designs with blocks, rather than making
them individually, and a lot of the
more intricate designs can’t be done
that way.
“There is a market for the finer ones,
because the elite in Indonesia will
always wear them. It is improving
formerly, 70 percent ‘tjap’ were being
produced to 30 percent of the finer
designs. Now it is more like 60 per-
cent to 40 percent.”
Batik production has grown from
a cottage industry into a substantial
one in which producers have formed
themselves into co-operatives, and
batiks are exported to America,
Malaysia, and even Milan (“men wear
jackets from batik fabrics there”). In
Indonesia, villages have become well
known for the creation of certain
traditional patterns, and families and
royal houses are identified by specific
designs, which are reserved for them.
“Mrs. Suharto likes traditional designs
in browns, so they have become very
fashionable at present, but President
Sukarno used to like modern colors.”
How highly would he rate the former
President’s artistic tastes? we asked,
remembering the recent publication of
a set of volumes of President Sukarno’s
art collection. “He had some good
pieces of Indonesian art, but he was
the sole arbitrator he had no critics
and nobody knows all its areas well.
As for his appreciation of European
art, his was the first generation to
receive a Western education and his
tastes reflect the tastes of the Indo-
nesian intellectuals of that generation
the first to be exposed to Western
art. My generation is the third to be
educated in the West, and I think we
have a better understanding of Western
art.”
Tirtaamidjaja’s involvment with
Indonesian art began in London, when
he was asked to lecture on the subject.
“I knew almost nothing about it, so
I went along to the British Museum,
read all I could about batik, and
became interested so interested that
I wrote a book about it when I got
back to Indonesia. I went roaring round
Java to collect samples, then I was
invited to give lectures about it, and
the whole thing snowballed.”
THE CARPET AS ART FORM
“IT’S NOT SO MUCH a floor-
covering as an art form,” Mrs. Denis
Croneen explained as we studied an
aristocratic trio of Persian carpets on
exhibition at her husband’s showroom
in North Sydney.
They were, she went on, part of a
set of five carpets worth $40,000, which
once belonged to the Baron de Roths-
child. She and her husband first saw
them in Switzerland six years ago. Were
they for sale? “Well, if the owner gets
the price, but he refuses to split them
up. They must be sold as a set. If they
weren’t, they’d lose some of their value,
because they were all woven at famous
court manufactories in Persia during
the early 19th century, and they’re very
rare. It would be like splitting up a
Georgian dining-room set.”
If Mrs. Croneen is doubtful about
the possibility of an Australian collec-
tor mustering up $40,000 worth of
enthusiasm, she does think there’s been
an increase in the number of Australian
collectors. “We have quite a few people
with collections on a modest scale. We
have been trying to impress upon
people that a Persian carpet is not sub-
ject to the dictates of fashion. Some
people say, I want my friends to see
it’s a Persian carpet, and they choose
something that’s pretentious and mere-
tricious.”
The rugs on exhibition belong to one
of the best periods of oriental rug
weaving, and display all the glowing
intricacy of design court-weaving was
famous for. “The method of production
was always very costly, too. They’re
woven in pure silk and they’re very
finely knotted. There are two types of
rugs—these and carpets done by
nomadic tribesmen and peasant vil-
lagers, which are unsophisticated and
spontaneous, and valuable because
they’re such good examples of folk art.
In some instances, the kind of terrain
where the weavers lived was reflected
in the technique of the rugs.”
The very best, we were told, were
done in the 16th and 17th centuries,
but they’re a little more rare. People
like Paul Getty and the Victoria and
Albert Museum own those.
MAN OF INFLUENCE
THE SOLUTION to our seemingly
permanently ailing theatre might be
for someone to persuade novelist Pat-
rick White to turn drama critic. Jane
Street Theatre, a more youthful off-
shoot of Sydney’s Old Tote, has been
presenting a revue, “Terror Australis.”
This was received by critics with
something less than enthusiasm. The
“Sun” critic said the writers had found
“not one new target nor a single sharper
shaft;” the “Mirror” found it a “bore,”
“irritating and childish”; the “Herald”
critic found the cast “slugged away at
their stale material with endearing zest
and invention” so that he was somewhat
ashamed at being “bored with so much
priggish self-righteousness.”
However, a few days later Mr. White
wrote a letter to “The Sydney Morn-
ing Herald” giving his view that “Ter-
ror Australis” had “more vitality, ori-
ginality, and wit in the performers and
direction than I have experienced since
last at large in the outer world.”
Before the letter appeared, houses
had been down to 20 or 30 and the
end of the run was in sight; since, they
have been playing to capacity houses
and the run has been extended.


BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Strange signals
and stranger
explanations
OF COURSE, you read about the
strange radio signals. The National
Radio Astronomy Observatory at
Parkes picked them up and so did the
antenna operated by Cornell University
at Arecioo, Puerto Rico. They were
coming through at the rate of one
every 1.3 seconds and were described
as “of a curious character of incredible
consistency.” The feeling is that the
signals could have come from another
civilisation.
Certainly, they did. Actually, after
careful consultation with Mr. Lynch,
and the realisation that it will not
harm our war effort, the full story can
be told. For nearly a year now under
the Venusian Inner Planet Familiaris-
ation Act of 1966, Venus has been
sending representatives to quietly look
us over and send reports back home.
Garth and Professor Lumiere know all
about it. This week your correspondent
gained yet another major new beat,
he secured a copy of a letter that a
young Venusian was trying to send
home to his father. Here it is in
detail:
Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne.
March 22,
Dear Dad,
My transistor picked up those radio
signals you were sending on March 11,
and I know how anxious you are, but
believe me, I haven’t had a chance to
write since then. I hope everything is
all right with you. Things are abso-
lutely shocking here. Dad, it’s a dying
planet.
You know, when you were drop-
ping me off here we passed the moon
on the way through? Well, Melbourne
is just like that, all brown and covered
with an inch of dust. As you walk any-
where little spurts puff up under foot.
And they’re all going mad, starving
for this water. By June it will be all
gone, but do you know what happens,
and it is very strange. In the late
evenings the maddened citizens go out
with buckets and start pouring it on
the ground.
Now they have a new thing. On the
telephone you can dial for stock ex-
change reports, sporting results, cook-
ing recipes, a prayer, a talk with a
psychiatrist, lottery results; now they
can dial the Board of Works for
recorded water restrictions. They are
very excited about this, the first city in
the universe that offers such a service.
And in the midst of all this it is
Garden Week. Examples of lawns and
flowers are on display at the Exhibi-
tion. I suppose this is an example of
bravery and defiance like we showed
during the battle of Venus.
The man in charge of everything is
Sir Bolte, and everybody loves him.
Just to give you an example, the other
day he was described as a humbug. I
checked on this and discovered that a
humbug was a marvellous sweetmeat
usually on sale at candy stores. Also,
he has been described as the Nero of
Melbourne. What a compliment. Nero’s
an emperor who has been remembered
for thousands of years. But they do
exchange marvellous compliments of
great subtlety. Mr. Calwell, a leader
here, said Sir Bolte indulged in horse-
and-buggy pre-Edwardian politics. Pre-
Edwardian, you see, was Melbourne’s
greatest, most prosperous boom era.
Sir Bolte, in turn, said Mr. Calwell was
the greatest hillbilly of them all. Mel-
bourne people adore hillbillies. They
listen to them on the radio all the
time.
But, Dad, are these people mixed up!
Sir Bolte can’t run anything, because
he hasn’t enough money. Then the
starving workers, who haven’t any
money because Sir Bolte can’t give it
to them, are all going on strike. So
what does Sir Bolte do? He has an
Essential Services Act for taking thous-
ands of dollars off the workers for
striking because they haven’t any
dollars. Do you follow me, Papa?
Sir Bolte. is trying to solve everything
with a new tax, a cent out of every
$lO. But a Mr. Gorton, in Canberra, is
trying to stop him. I don’t understand
“The signals indicate extremes of tem-
perature and a water shortage-I'd
say the’re coming from either Venus
or Melbourne!”
this either, Papa. He’s not even a “sir.”
And in all this madness people get
frenzied, they rush around in auto-
mobiles at frantic speeds and constantly
bang into each other, killing themselves.
I am staying here by the third elm in
the Fitzroy Gardens it is the only
safe place. I mean, a soldier gets killed
in a war somewhere and it is on the
front page, but 20 times as many get
killed banging into each other in motor
cars, but they like this. I think they
feel it is a good way to go to their
ancestors. After all, they are trying to
discourage people from using the safe
trams and trains. Huge financial deficits
are announced for the trains, and just
the other day the trams had their big-
gest loss in history. But they are very
cunning, you see, they make no im-
provements to the trains and trams,
but they build marvellous big freeways
to encourage further this mystic car
killing rite.
Back home, of course, we don’t
tolerate the green people, but here it
has me tossed. They think it is mar-
vellous to call everything by names used
by black people. They have in Mel-
bourne a festival called Moomba, which
means let’s get together and have fun.
But no black people ever quite do
this, d here se.ems to be only one way
a black person can get to the top and
that is by fighting. There’s a man called
Lionel Rose who has just returned as
champion of the world, and cheered by
all the white citizens. He became cham-
pion by knocking dow r n a lot of white
people. Dad, I don’t get it. Meanwhile,
just a few weeks before another Abori-
ginal boy arrived, sent down from the
bush. He carried a ticket. Name: Peter.
Address: Mildura Rubbish Dump.
Dad, I think I should explain to-
you that the girls here are very bold.
Don’t tell Mother, but sex is»every-
where. The girls wear practically no
clothes at all and I blush dark blue at
things I see every night and even dur-
ing the Public Service lunch hour, right
here in the Gardens.
I think I told you about their
religion. The religious day is Saturday
and no work is done on that day. They
gather at grounds and w r atch with very,
very great devotion the religious rites.
On Sunday nothing much happens at
all. The citizens can go to picture shows,
they can go to cycling, tennis, soccer,
but the theatres without special per-
mits are not open and a Mr. Rylah
has just closed all the discotheques on
Sunday: these are the dancing houses.
Dad, it is all right to go to a movie, but
not a dance. You in all your wisdom
could explain this to me. But I fear
we wall not have to worry much longer.
The Yarra water is turning rank and
bitter, Sir Bolte has turned against
the Board of Works, the water people,
and it is obvious they are about to
abandon this planet. Dad, don’t wait
until May for the end of term. You’ve
got to come and rescue me, please. But
then probably you won’t get this let-
ter. I think the mailmen are going on
strike again. I ant ruined.
Yours affectionately,
Alfred.

Elegant clients
with the
ability to pay
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
WHILE EVERYONE is saying they
can’t believe it, 11 Toulouse-Lautrecs
sold and one reserved by noon on the
day of the preview, at those astronomi-
cal prices, Dari, $2OOO or thereabouts;
while everyone’s getting over this shock,
art gallery owner Kym Bonython stands
there thinking he had better cut the
willow in his Japanese garden. The
branch that slaps everyone in the face;
well, its raining now, and no one’s too
pleased to be drenched or lacerated. By
the end of the day, 16 Lautrecs are
sold, four reserved, leaving six to go.
Fantastic.
Also, by the end of the day, Kim
Bonython has had a traumatic moment;
the trouble with his parties, he says,
people don’t leave. So he does what
is becoming the chic thing to do in
such moments, he turns the lights off.
The next thing is this terrible crash
and the waiter and sculpture and tray-
ful of glasses are all on the floor.
The French who are at the preview
are amused at Australian enthusiasm
for these lithographs, some of which
have 200 and 300 copies. One says to
George Mora without knowing who
George Mora is he brought the
exhibition from his Melbourne gallery
to Bonython’s in Paddington that he
doesn’t think much of them. Monsieur
Michel Carriol, the French Commercial
Attache, is asked for his opinion of
the Lautrecs and he replies, “I like
the art gallery very much.” Someone
suggests doing the rounds of galleries
abroad, buying up the junk, and sell-
ing it here. They’d make millions.
The gallery is filling with lunchtime
devotees gasping for their gin-and-tonic
and artist Tony Woods, who is also
showing, says he wishes he could draw
like Toulouse. His work has the feeling,
all right, and he sells nine out of 25
by the end of the day. Mr. Woods
also has a few Toulousian comments on
the women present, which boil down to
whether they have “It” or not. Most
do not.
The social photographers are here
and they make a beeline. for Monsieur
Carriol who does have “It.” And there
is one-time model Patricia Miller going
through what she calls her brown phase
and saying hairdresser Alexander keeps
asking for her head. But Mrs. Miller
has had enough of modelling. And there
is also men’s outfitter John Lane pos-
ing for pictures in what, ten years ago,
would be called a zoot suit with a
reet pleat. Today, main, it’s gear. Any-
way, Mr. Lane is saying his opening
is tomorrow night, well it’s more of a
christening, really, there’s no food, just
100 bottles of champagne, to launch
his new shop in Double Bay . . .
. . . And there, at 7.30, where the
heads of Alexander’s clientele once re-
laxed for a sensuous back-shampoo now
rests the bottom of film-man Dick
Treweke. Screwing up one of Mr.
Lane’s fantastically expensive silk
Pucci dressing-gowns. And Mr. Treweke
says .he’s in dinner jacket because Beth
Churchill is dragging him on some-
where, God knows where. Beth
Churchill is up the far end of the old
salon where the dyeing and tinting took
place, examining Hermes ties with a
character who’s telling everyone they’re
free tonight, help yourselves. Actually,
anyone could steal anything at this
moment. Mr. Lane’s detective has been
called away to Bellevue Hill where
someone is beating someone up. You
know Bellevue Hill, says Mr. Lane.
There are 150 people here for the
christening, all the old familiar faces
of the Double Bay scene and attendant
areas, including impresario Harry
Miller, who combs his hair next door
in the window of The Women’s Out-
fitter (Est. 1968) before entering. He’s
just been, he says, to a terrible Qantas
exhibition. The clothes scene is so-so.
The men, actually, look more beautiful
than the girls. Conversation is . . .

maniac . .

husband? . . .”
“. . . they hate you, Daphne, but I
defend you . .
“. . . and off Patrick White went,
from Hong Kong to dear,
in an Akubra hat and Burberry rain-
coat . .
So, while everyone’s swirling around
dropping champagne all over Mr.
Lane’s goodies from Uncles Pucci,
Gucci, Hermes, and all, Mr. Lane is
outside on the pavement posing for
more pictures with one or other of his
big-spending customers. Actually, his
guests tonight have been chosen for
their he says loyalty, elegance,
and ability to pay their bills. And while
he dislikes talking about the price of
his clothes, well, the Press are always
asking him what’s the most expensive
thing. He does mention en passant that
the latest thing in shopping bags are
hessian horserug containers by Hermes,
for $2O each. Lie told Uncle Hermes to
keep his horserugs. Altogether, though,
he thinks the hairdressing salon has
converted nicely to a masculine atmos-
phere. Especially the snakeskin counters,
don’t we think?

The sadness of
the second-class
passenger
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
THE WORDS “first class” have a
beautiful sound. To be a first-class
passenger, play first-class cricket, or
win first-class honors all these dis-
tinctions are balm to the ego. But the
existence of a first class unhappily im-
plies that there is a second class. And
nobody likes to be second-class any-
thing. Witness the reputed mortification
of the lady who was awarded the Otto-
man Order of Chastity (Second Class).
Shipping companies woke up to this
long ago, and changed the name of
their second-class accommodation to
“tourist.” Qantas allows one to travel
first class or “economy.” Business enter-
prises that have to woo the customer
are generally careful to avoid any in-
vidious mention of classes. Thus petrol
is either standard or super. Holden cars
are Belmont, Kingswood, or Premier.
Peaches are choice or extra-choice.
Where things or people are graded
into classes, it is usually in a non-
commercial organisation that does not
have to bother about ruffled feelings.
An example is the Navy’s classification
of cooks. The ascending grades are
ordinary cook; cook (second class); and
cook. Whatever a man’s culinary talent,
the very fact that he is an ordinary
cook must discourage him from cook-
ing anything out of the ordinary. Nor
are consumers likely to approach his
dishes with lip-smacking anticipation,
knowing them to be the handiwork of
an ordinary cook.
Even when he has earned promotion
to cook (second class) his rank is less
than reassuring. A Navy wife would be
unwise to issue invitations by promising
the guests: “My husband is going to
cook the dinner. He’s a cook (second

class), so the food should be almost
excellent.” The morale of Navy cooks
would probably be improved if they
were given ranks which stressed their
skill rather than their relative lack of
it.
Zoologists, too, like class distinctions.
That is why they gave its name to the
Lesser Bird of Paradise. It is a beautiful
bird, but they wanted it to feel in-
ferior to the Great Bird of Paradise.
Considerations of the same kind arise
at schools and universities. The grading
of students according to their abilities
inevitably happens at these institutions,
but some of them do it more nicely than
others. This is apparent in their dif-
ferent methods of announcing examin-
ation results.
The University of Melbourne sticks
to the stern custom of awarding first-
class, second-class, and third-class
honors. It is gratifying for those placed
in the first class, but not so for the
others. They feel they are embarking on
their professional careers with a second-
or third-class ticket.
The system is derived from England,
and in particular from Oxford, where
the cult of the “first” has been carried
to extremes. The Oxford student is
encouraged to believe that if he gets
a first-class degree he is automatically
a first-class person; while if he gets a
second he is stamped for ever with a
brand of mediocrity, like a second-
grade egg (I know because I am one of
the eggs). To rub in the humiliation,
Oxford even gives some candidates a
fourth-class degree a credential
about equal in status to that of the
Indians who put after their names “B.A.
(Failed).”
The University of Sydney, by con-
trast, publishi animation results in
the three catt of High Distinction,
Distinction, a Credit. This humane
arrangement gives everyone something
to be pleased about. A Credit is credit-
able; a Distinction is distinguished; and
a High Distinction is wonderful. The
classification is akin to that used in
American universities, where graduates
can be designated cum laude, magna
cum laude, or summa cum laude
(roughly equivalent to good, damn
good, and bloody good), but nobody
is stigmatised as mediocri cum laude.
A touch of consideration for personal
feelings can be noticed also in New
South Wales primary schools. The
classes in each year, though graded
according to pupils’ abilities, do not
advertise the fact by alphabetical titles
3A, 38, etc. Each class is known,
instead, by the first letter of the
teacher’s name. If a girl is in 3C it
implies no inferiority; it happens just
because her teacher is Miss Cox.
I like this break away from the old
idea that the sheep and the goats should
be labelled as such. In educating the
young there is more to be said for
the General Motors view that what-
ever the differences between models,
they should all be given encouraging
names.

Getting the feel
of our own power
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
“WE MAY NOT yet be able to accept
you as fellow Asians,” the retiring Indo-
nesian Ambassador to Australia said
in an interview last week, “but one
thing we know: Australia keeps its
word. Whether it is Vietnam or trade
or aid, we know that what Australia
says she will do she will do. As long
as this is true Asia will have a basis to
respect you.”
In these three sentences General
Kosasih has explained to Australians
something that our own political leaders
should explain to us more often: that
it is above all respect, even more than
friendship, that provides the basis for
successful friendly relations between
nations. It might be worth recalling
that at the time of Sukarno’s Confron-
tation with Malaysia some Australian
critics of Australian policy attacked it
because, they said, we should be
“friendly” with Indonesia. But if we
had been “friendly” with Sukarno’s
regime in that sort of way —merely in
giving in to something we thought
wrong what would we by now have
achieved? Disregard in Singapore and
Malaysia and probably disregard in
Indonesia, too, because the anti-
Sukarno forces now in control have a
fundamentally different conception of
the future of their nation.
General Kosasih was not alone in
understanding at the time that, as he
puts it, although Sir Robert Menzies
was more orientated toward Europe,
“even when Confrontation was at its
height, he was not anti-Indonesian. He
understood, and Mr. Hasluck under-
stood, what Indonesia’s position was.
They may not have approved, but they
understood.” It is the understanding
that we can oppose the policies of a
neighboring government without hysteri-
cally hating or despising its people that
is also likely to lead to respect between
nations, so that in a quarrel as hap-
pened during the Confrontation a
sense of moderation can ensure that we
do no more than is necessary. It is
such a sense of moderation, combined
with a readiness to do what is neces-
sary, that produces the kind of respect
that, when a quarrel is over, easily
leads to a return to more friendly re-
lations. The Indonesians can remember
that Australia kept its word in opposing
Confrontation; but they can also re-
member that an earlier Australian
Government kept its word in support-
ing Indonesian independence against
the Dutch.
This is an important part of what
“credibility” means. If a nation has
a strong reputation for being prepared
to do what it says it will do, this in
itself gives it an extra strength in its
relations with other nations. This does
not inhibit bargaining. In fact, bargain-
ing may sometimes be an essential part
of “credibility”—as a kind of evidence
of sincerity. But it does mean that when
a bargain is made, it is respected.
For a nation of only moderate
strength such as Australia, a reputation
for meaning what it says gives a little
extra strength. For anyone who cares
to look at our history it would seem
obvious that when we enter into a com-
mitment we do mean what we say.
Being an ally is part of our natural
condition. We have a history of being
a reliable friend. But “credibility,” of
course, also includes an estimate of a
nation’s other strengths. And here many
Australians are still inclined, in a self-
satisfying kind of way, to sell their
strength short. Because we are not a
super power, they see us as that non-
thing a non-power, not strong enough
to play any part in South-East Asia.
To say this is to speak from ignor-
ance of what power is. It is not just
super weapons or super populations. It
is a matter of relative strengths in
particular situations. And of these
strengths economic power can be of
critical importance. In this respect it
cannot be repeated too often that the
wealth generated each year in Australia
is greater than the wealth generated
in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and
the Philippines combined. In the area
of South-East Asia and the South West
Pacific Australia is, economically, the
only strong power. This means, for
example, that Australia can sustain a
much greater military strength than
merely looking at its population would
suggest. But it is not just a matter of
military strength. It means even more
obviously that Australian economic as-
sistance can be of enormous importance
among its nearest neighbors. Two
tokens of this are that total inter-
national aid to Indonesia is no greater
than Commonwealth aid to the State
of Western Australia and that the
Indonesian Government Budget is about
the same size as the Budget of the State
of Queensland.
General Kosasih was right when he
said: “You know, it is not only what
the people say, it is what their leaders
say . . . what he says, that is what the
nation says.” He was right when he
said of Mr. Holt: “He was trained by
Sir Robert; he reflected Sir Robert.
But there was one important difference:
Mr. Holt seemed to Asians to be more
orientated toward Asia. And, because he
was their leader, the Australian people
also became more orientated toward
Asia.” It is to be hoped that when
Mr. Gorton makes his trip this year to
a number of Asian nations he will do
so in the spirit of Mr. Holt, and that
when he comes back he will not only
further lead the Australian people on
that journey that Mr. Holt began but
also try to give them a more realistic
sense of their own strength, which may
be a bit greater than many of them
imagine.
Labor’s pains are
still in the same spot
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
LABOR’S performance so far in the
present Parliament has been largely per-
functory. Confronting a raw Prime
Minister in the shape of John Gorton
it has not done any real probing into
his capacity.
The reason for this is that Labor is
preoccupied. With an electoral redis-
tribution coming up that complicates
the problems of securing their ALP pre-
selections, Labor members are much
more concerned with what is going on
within their own ranks than with con-
fronting the new Gorton administration.
Either consciously or intuitively, they
realise that moves at present under way
within the ALP could have as large,
possibly a larger, influence upon their
electoral fortunes as any action they
might take against the Liberal-Country
Party coalition.
Within the parliamentary Labor Cau-
cas everything is temporarily sweetness
and light. Nobody wants trouble at
the parliamentary level or to be blamed
at a later stage for possible further set-
backs. But within the ALP machine
things are different. Whitlam is again
feuding with the Left-wing Victorian
ALP executive. If this were merely a
continuance of the now venerable Whit-
lam-Victorian ALP executive feud it
could possibly be ignored. But there
is a new factor in the situation that
could break the facade of seeming unity
that Whitlam —with the assistance,
ironically, of Left-wing pro-Victorian
executive parliamentary forces has
been able to build up in Labor’s par-
liamentary Caucus.
Pro-Whitlam elements within the
ALP are now undoubtedly moving for
Federal ALP intervention in Victoria.
Their argument is simple. Election
experiences over the past ten years
have shown clearly that with the
Democratic Labor Party in existence
Labor needs more than an electoral
swing to win power. It needs an
avalanche. Such an avalanche could

come out of an economic collapse. But
there isn’t much chance of that.
For Labor to gain power a deal of
some kind has to be made with the
DLP. The DLP will not deal while
the Victorian ALP remains under its
present control. Therefore the solution
is to get rid of the present controllers
of the Victorian ALP.
There is no doubt that the Whitlam
cohorts would like—and are working—
to get rid of the present Victorian ALP.
But for Federal intervention in Victoria,
Whitlam has to have the numbers on
the ALP Federal executive.
His supporters claim that subject to
one doubt—South Australia—he could
have the numbers and that South Aus-
tralia, doubtful now, could be persuaded
into supporting Federal intervention.
The Whitlam forces are counting
upon N.S.W. support in the move for
intervention. But even here I cannot
see any certainty. The controllers of
the N.S.W. ALP could never nerve
themselves to support intervention when
they were in a position of strength as
the Government of N.S.W. and seem-
ingly the most virile Labor movement
in the Commonwealth. If they would
not move from strength then, why
should they now move from weakness?
But, even given the two N.S.W. votes
on the ALP Federal Executive, plus
the two votes from Tasmania, plus
Whitlam’s own vote and that of his
Deputy, Lance Barnard (who must be
considered a doubtful factor as he has
maintained fairly close links with the
Victorians), the anti-Victorian forces
are still a long way short of a majority
on the 17-man-strong Federal executive.
I could not see either the Senate
Leader, Lionel Murphy (who has had
periods of difficulty with the State
executive in his native N.S.W. and who
was helped by the Victorians to become
Senate Leader), or the Senate Deputy
Leader, Sam Cohen, a Victorian, voting
by preference to oust the present Vic-
torian ALP executive.
Queensland, which has consistently
supported Victoria over recent years, is
probably more firmly pro-Victorian
than ever. In Western Australia, Vic-
toria has a powerful ally in the shape
of W.A. ALP Secretary, F. E. (“Joe”)
Chamberlain. Chamberlain’s power
might have declined in that State but
he is still one of the best committee
men in the ALP, knowing what he
wants and usually able to secure it but
even more capable in preventing other
people getting what they want. On
top of that, Victoria has its own two
votes and, possibly (despite the Whit-
lam followers’ claim to the contrary),
the support of the Northern Territory
delegate Jock Nelson, former MHR.
The Whitlam forces believe that they
can swing South Australia’s two votes
their way, by working through S.A.
Premier, Don Dunstan, and Clyde
Cameron, MHR, neither of whom are
delegates but who are extremely in-
fluential in the South Australian ALP.
Personally, I will believe a change in
attitude on the part of South Australia
when I actually see it.

Energetic exporter, Doug
Hancock, wants to know:
Where else can you get a
market growth rate
of 200%?
What’s your product growth rate on the
Australian market?
200 per cent?
That’s the figure Doug Hancock, Sales
Director of Finsbury Sales and Services,
estimates to be his export growth rate for
the next 12 months. Doug Hancock naturally
believes exporting is well worth the effort.
“I realised how huge overseas markets
were,” he says, “But I wasn’t sure we
could supply.” Finsbury self-priming
pumps are in over 20 countries now.
“We started by contacting the Department
of Trade, and sent letters outlining our
products to all overseas Trade Commis-
sioners. They replied, gave comments
on their markets. We picked about 12 of
these countries - and we were off.”
Why don’t you make a move into exports?
The market potential and growth prospects
in highly populated countries can be
enormous.
Note: Exporting can increase your
turnover; can lower unit costs of your
product; can iron out seasonal fluctuations;
and can increase profits. Your company
will gain extra marketing knowledge,
and prestige.
The government helps you with:
Payroll tax, travel and promotion costs;

Commissioner Services; promotion
publicity; and Department of Trade and

AUSTRALIA
The coming debate:
Australia and the bomb
WHILE IN SYDNEY last week, Aus-
tralia’s Atomic Energy Commission
chairman, Sir Phillip Baxter, was telling
Rotarians that Australia should arm
herself with the most effective weapons
man could devise, in Federal Parlia-
ment and in the buildings around Can-
berra housing public servants, things
were less clear cut as the Government
prepared to face up to making a de-
cision on whether to denounce the right
to acquire nuclear weapons. That is
what it will do if it signs the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty coming up for
discussion and signature at the UN
General Assembly next month.
The Government has an interdepart-
mental committee consisting of rep-
resentatives from the External Affairs,
Defence, Prime Minister’s, National
Development, and Trade Departments
and this is expected to make a sub-
mission to Cabinet early next month, as
to Australia’s course of action at the
UN.
It seems out of the question that the
Australian representative will be given
simple instructions one way or the
other about supporting or opposing the
treaty. A simple “no” is impossible for
diplomatic reasons. On many occasions
the Australian Government, like most
other governments, has spoken in sup-
port of the principles of limiting the
spread of nuclear weapons as part of
attempts to promote general disarma-
ment. It would be too much of a diplo-
Baxter...the most effective weapons
matic somersault for the Treaty to
be summarily dismissed.
On the other hand, the Australian
Government will not quickly announce
any intention to sign the Treaty. There
are serious doubts about whether it is
going to apply in the Indo-Pacific area.
Japan and India will not sign the
Treaty as it stands, and some reports
suggest they are unlikely to sign at all.
Indonesia and Pakistan are also in
doubt.
But besides the possible intention of
others there are a number of points
being argued for and against the Treaty
within the Government. In its favor
it is argued that the Treaty is a small
but worthwhile step in the direction of
arms control which, if successful, would
to some degree limit the danger of
nuclear war and that Australia should
not do anything which hindered this.
Australia does not want nuclear arma-
ments to proliferate in the Pacific area,
with one country after another acquir-
ing them and every country aspiring
to them.
On the other hand, China is already
a nuclear power, with a medium-range
bomb capacity, and by 1971 or 1972 it
will have a full-scale intercontinental
hydrogen bomb system as well as a
range of tactical atomic bombs. The
question is whether China can be
adequately deterred from nuclear black-
mail by other countries in the region.
The joint declaration by three of
the nuclear powers—the U.S., U.S.S.R.,
and Britain—that they would recognise
as “aggression” the use or threat of
use of nuclear weapons and would act
jointly in accordance with the UN
Charter, has already failed as a reassur-
ance to India that it has protection
against China’s bombs and missiles. The
Indians having described it as far too
vague and uncertain in operation to be
useful.
Four pi'esently bomb-less countries
have an immediate capacity to become
nuclear-weapon powers: West Germany,
Japan, Israel, and India. Each of these
has the plutonium material required
and equipment to refine it into bombs.
Germany and Japan could become
nuclear powers of the strength of
France or China within a period of
about 12 months from a government
directive. India and Israel might take
about two years. Canada and Italy come
next in any list of nuclear ranking,
with plenty of bomb-making potential
but not the same great-power aspira-
tions or defence anxieties.
Other countries are well on the way
to developing the capacity for acquiring
nuclear weapons, with large plutonium-
producing power stations under con-
struction and able to produce nuclear
weapons within a period of about three
years: Sweden, Switzerland, Spain,.
Argentina, Pakistan, Czechoslovakia,.
East Germany, Holland, Belgium,.
Mexico, Bulgaria, and Hungary.
But nuclear weapon technology has
developed so quickly that almost any
country with a few scientists and sonie
electricity production can make bombs,,
if it sets itself to it. Uranium is no
longer needed as a raw material. Evea
sea water will do. Full-scale nuclear
reactors are no longer needed to pro-
duce plutonium. Common linear ac-
celerators can be used. And there are
hardly any secrets left in the technology
of manufacturing nuclear weapons. All
of Australia’s neighbors, with the ex-
ception of Nauru, have the small tech-
nical capacity now needed to make
atomic bombs, given time.
At the UN General Assembly a
whole range of objections are likely to<
be made by the host of potential
nuclear powers. Led by India, there
will be pressure for meaningful guaran-
tees by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. of
a credible nuclear deterrent against
China. Led by Sweden, there will be
demands for clarification of the safe-
guards provisions.
The most general objection will be
against the one-sidedness of the Treaty,,
in restricting states without nuclear
weapons while putting few obligations
on those who have them.
The Japanese are likely to insist that
the Treaty be conditional on the five-
AEC plant at Lucas Heights


nuclear powers making real progress
toward nuclear disarmament. They are
unlikely to be satisfied with the Treaty’s
vague commitment to “pursue negotia-
tions in good faith on effective measures
relating to the cessation of the nuclear
arms race at an early date.”
In the Government, all these reserva-
tions are being voiced. In the National
Development Department there is
apprehension at the possibility that the
Treaty may put obstacles in the way
of peaceful developments of atomic
energy. The Atomic Energy Commis-
sion in its annual report pointed out
that the use of nuclear explosives for
blasting dams and harbors had been
hampered already by various safeguard
systems. They are also concerned at
the nuisance of inspectors and compli-
cated systems of auditing of fissionable
materials which are part of the inspec-
tion process.
The most substantial objections to
signing the Treaty come from those
who take a sceptical view about the
future of our alliance with the United
States. They say we should not commit
ourselves to perpetual dependence on
the U.S. by renouncing the right to
acquire nuclear weapons because the
U.S. might not in all circumstances
provide Australia with a nuclear
umbrella.
There is a good deal of debate in
the Government about the adequacy
of the “emergency-exit procedure”
(which allows a signatory to go nuclear
as a result of “extraordinary events
jeopardising its supreme interests”).
Those favoring staying out of the
Treaty say that wherever conventional
military power was applied by Aus-
tralia, it would be more effective if
backed by a nuclear deterrent.
But the signers say that Australia
will need nuclear weapons only in an
emergency and that the Treaty does not
prevent it from making allowance for
that. They advocate that Australia set
to catching up with the rest of the
industrial world by building nuclear
power plants and stockpiling the atom-
bomb material plutonium, which they
produce as a by-product. Meanwhile,
there is nothing in the Treaty to prevent
the Department of Supply preparing
the mechanical parts of the bombs, and
by late next year Australia will have
an effective nuclear delivery system in
the fleet of 24 Fill bombers.
Since there is now no longer any
need for testing atomic bombs their
technology is foolproof a modest
nuclear system could be 99 percent
completed within the terms of the
Treaty. The other one percent of the
work loading the mechanical bomb
cases with the Atomic Energy Com-
mission’s plutonium could be quickly
accomplished in an emergency situa-
tion, while Australia was applying the
exit provisions of the Treaty.
This assessment, if correct, makes
the question of signing the Treaty
rather academic, since Australia is
among the most backward countries
of the world in production of nuclear
materials. There are only tiny nuclear
research reactors which produce almost
negligible amounts of plutonium and
no major reactors are planned.
In this respect, Australia is behind
not only the leading countries but also
behind the middle runners, countries
which have built, or are building,
power reactors which will produce sub-
stantial quantities of plutonium as a
by-product to electricity generation.
In the largest industrial countries,
nuclear power plants already provide
electricity more cheaply than conven-
tional coal plants. As early as 1966, in
the U.S. and Britain, in tendering for
designs for large, new power stations,
nuclear plant manufacturers beat con-
ventional firms in being able to offer a
more economic proposition to the com-
mercial electricity authorities. Chicago,
New York, and Tokyo will soon be ser-
viced mainly by nuclear plants and in
the U.S. and Japan the capacity of
nuclear plants under construction is
now greater than that of all other
conventional types combined. Nuclear
power plants are now thoroughly con-
ventional in the advanced countries.
In Australia it is argued that nuclear
power is not yet competitive with con-
ventional sources. The Atomic Energy
Commission estimates it will not be
until about 1975. The reason is that
N.S.W., where the market is large
enough for a really big and cheap
nuclear station, has some of the world’s
cheapest coal. Victoria has the next
cheapest conventional fuel in its lignite.
South Australia, once thought likely to
be Australia’s first nuclear generating
State, is sold on its natural gas.
So, unless an immediate expansion of
Australia’s metal refining capacity in
Western Australia or Queensland pro-
vides the market for the power which
nuclear plants generate, it will wait on
Victoria and N.S.W. in the mid-
’seventies, by which time it is certain
that nuclear plants will be cheaper than
coal plants of the size now being in-
-stalled in the Hunter and Latrobe
Valleys.
The alternative would be for the
Australian Government to do what the
governments of most other advanced
countries have been doing for some
years: to provide some form of subsidy
to nuclear plants as a defence measure
—until they become financially self-
supporting.
Australian spending on nuclear power
and research is extraordinarily small:
$8.6 million this year. The Canadians,
by comparison, are spending something
in the region of $3OO million, and the
amount is scheduled to rise dramatic-
ally with commitments already made.
There are also exciting possibilities
of combining electricity generation and
desalination of water in large-scale
nuclear plants. Construction is begin-
ning off Los Angles of a $450 million
plant which will provide a fresh-water
supply equivalent to Sydney’s in
volume, and about the Snowy Scheme’s
quantity of electricity. The costs being
quoted suggest that it might make
financial sense already in the Adelaide-
Whyalla area, where major expansion
of water supply and power facilities will
be extraordinarily expensive.
Trade
Troubles with quotas
IN FEBRUARY, 1960, import quotas
were abandoned with great Govern-
ment fanfare. They were the last hang-
over from post-war austerity and regu-
lation, and the Government justifiably
congratulated itself on this achievement,
especially when under attack for other
aspects of its economic policy in 1961
and 1962.
But it looks in 1968 as if the import
restrictions may be creeping back. At
present they are being applied on a
‘‘temporary” basis by the Special
Advisory Authority on a number of
textile items. For example, when the
Parliament got up last last year it
approved quota restrictions on knitted
coats, jumpers, cardigans, and sweaters,
a market of about $lOO million a year.
Almost no notice was taken of this,
like most SAA judgments.
It has since been referred to the
Tariff Board, as it must be under legi-
slation, but the Board takes anything up
to 18 months to consider cases and
make recommendations. Meanwhile,
imports of knitwear are subjected to
G. J. Colley, Ireland’s Trade and
Commerce Minister ... trade balance
$6 million in Australia’s favor


the most severe and discriminating form
of protection available.
The local knitwear industry is
generally protected against Asian im-
ports by a tariff of 62.5 percent, but
until two or three years ago was effec-
tively protected by the greater fashion-
consciousness of local manufacturers —
Asian countries confining themselves to
baby clothes, shawls, and the like. But,
equipped with modern machines, and
buying the rights to fashionable designs,
manufacturers in Hong Kong and
Taiwan have since 1965 been hurdling
the 62 percent tariff barrier. Imports
have risen from half a million to about
three million garments.
At this rate they had 14 percent of
the Australian market. The SAA con-
sidered that up to this time the Aus-
tralian industry had not suffered detri-
ment to the extent which would justify
emergency protection. But on the basis
of imports in the three months to Sep-
tember last year it foresaw the possi-
bility of imoorts gaining 35 percent of
the Australian market and imposed
quotas to keep them down to the 14
percent share.
But it is not only Asian suppliers of
cheap knitwear who are suffering. Top
quality, expensive, hand-knitted textiles
from Ireland, for example, are now sub-
ject to the same blanket restrictions;
importers who did not establish a
“quota” for knitwear last year simply
cannot do business. As the Irish Minister
for Industry and Commerce, Mr.
George Colley, protested in Sydney last
week, quota restrictions like this are
hitting at the heart of Ireland’s attempts
to improve her four-to-one trade imbal-
ance with Australia.
The Irish are pretty angry about it.
Yet the amounts involved are so small
by Australian standards (the Irish only
manage to sell about $2-million worth
of goods, mainly textiles, to Australia
a year, and knitwear is only a small
part of this) that the price of our
retaining good relations by removing
the quotas would not be very high.
The irony is this severe protection
lies in the fact that local manufacturers
have been put at a competitive dis-
advantage by previous tariff decisions.
Their raw material costs have been
boosted hugely by high tariffs awarded
last year to the synthetic-fibre manu-
facturers. Where Australian apparel
manufacturers can buy their raw
materials at a world price they can
often compete very effectively on a
world market: our lightweight woven
cotton goods have a large export
market.
A far more significant area in which
import quotas may be imposed is motor-
vehicles. Imports of Japanese cars have
climbed steeply in the past two years
despite an increase in tariff duties to
45 percent. Today they have 12 percent
of the total Australian market and a
third of the four-cylinder market.
Forced to raise local content steeply
under Government-imposed plan, Aus-
tralian manufacturers of medium-
volume cars like Volkswagen and BMC
have been in increasing financial trouble.
VW has decided to close down Aus-
tralian production altogether. The
other manufacturers with GM-H
the free trader, the odd man out are
calling for import quotas against the
Japanese.
And they may get them. Trade Min-
ister McEwen in Parliament last week
said: “The Australian automotive in-
dustry is too important for it to be
allowed to be undermined. It is the
second biggest employer of labor in
Australia. As an employer it is second
only to the building industry. The
House can be assured that the investi-
gations that are being conducted will
not end in some empty manner . . .”
The difficulties of motor manufac-
turers do not relate to any general cost
disadvantages. Given long production
runs, they can produce as cheaply as
anywhere in the world. But, ironically
again, a Government-imposed plan has
forced small-volume sellers to high rates
of local content, which require them
to produce even the most specialised
items in Australia. Above a volume of
7500 they are forced to 95 percent
local content, incorporating expensive
components like gear trains made
locally.
The Tariff Board at the time of the
last inquiry told the Government that
it considered a volume of. at least
40,000 necessary to justify 95 percent
local content.
But the indications are that the Gov-
ernment, and the Trade Department
which administers these matters, will
not have the courage to admit the
failure of the plan. Rather than redraft
a more realistic one, it will probably
persist with the old one and simply
slam on the import quotas to cope with
the problem.
Western Australian elections
Against
"arrogance"
ALTHOUGH Western Australia’s
Liberal-Country Party coalition was
returned at Saturday’s election, the sig-
nificance of the result was the unexpec-
ted swing away from the Government.
Redistribution increased the number of
seats from 50 to 51. The Government’s
majority of eight has been cut to five
at best or as low as one. Late counting
continues this week.
David Brand, and particularly his
Minister for Northern and Industrial
Development, Charles Court, may be
highly popular in the boardrooms of big
companies in several countries, but the
election result suggests that the average
voter in the State is still waiting for
the echo of the boom to sound in his
own life and living.
Apart from Labor’s well-handled
education, housing and land shortage
criticisms, three factors stand out in
the swing against the Government. First
was the desire of voters to register a
protest against the Government tending
toward what is interpreted as arrogance.
Second was the fact that daily news-
papers’ policy unexpectedly came out
anti-Government during the campaign
despite a final acknowledgement that
a Liberal-Country Party would be best.
(Labor exploited this fully with good
advertising, quoting freely from news-
paper attacks on Government
arrogance.)
Third is the backlash of prosperity
that has hit Liberal white-collar voters
far more than the policy-makers are
willing to acknowledge; this was seen
in the predominantly urban anti-
Government swing.
Labor won back three of the seats
the Liberals had picked off at the previ-
ous election Canning, where Tom
Bateman seems set to defeat Ross
Elliott; Maylands, where bright young
Labor hope John Harman overcame the
strong personal vote for Bob Marshall;
and Perth, where Terry Burke was
helped by Independent Paul Ritter’s
unannounced how-to-vote card. This
created an unfortunate paradox in the
Perth seat, since votes were lost by
Peter Durack, who, in an impressive
first term, had represented the elector-
ate well in the very areas where rank
outsider Ritter was calling for action.
Of three new seats, Labor took Clon-
tarf through solid campaigning. Don
May is now likely to become a Parlia-
mentary fixture, while the Liberals won
Floreat with Andrew Mensaros and
Mirrabooka with Doug Cash. Labor’s
Kimberley sitting Member, Jack Rati-
gan, seemed likely to lose to Liberal
Keith Ridge. Two Labor seats unsettled
by retirements Northam by former
premier Bert Hawke and Merredin-
Yilgarn by Lionel Kelly are both in
grave danger.
The Country Party was jolted by the
strong polling of unendorsed Liberal
Roger Tonkin against Education and
Native Welfare Minister Edgar Lewis,
but this internecine affront was offset
by the Liberal Speaker, John Hearman,
being unseated by the Country Party’s
Ronald Kitney.

The ALP
Will Dunstan go to Canberra?
Dunstan...open to conviction, if it’s logical
By ALAN REID
IF LABOR LOSES the protracted elec-
toral struggle in South Australia, and as
an outcome moves into Opposition, it
could be to the Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party’s gain. South Australian
Premier Don Dunstan could move across
to the Federal Parliament.
The proposition has already been put
to Dunstan. He has been told that, if
he decides to move, the ALP would be
“honored” to find him a Federal seat.
The word “honored” is a peculiar one
in ALP terminology. But it is appar-
ently being used with genuine feeling.
Dunstan, lucid and able, appears the
type who can not only inspire loyalty
but retain it.
With an unusual modesty, he is never
convinced that he is right: he only
believes that he is right. This flexibility
means that, to the point of decision,
he is open to conviction provided that
he can be convinced on grounds of
logic. The grounds of logic being used
with him at present for a switch to
Canberra if Labor is forced into Oppo-
sition in Adelaide are:
If Labor goes into Opposition, it will
take at least a decade to correct the
gerrymander which robbed it of the
Government after receiving 53 percent
of the vote. But Dunstan, in his early
forties, represents leadership material on
the national as well as the State side.
For him to spend ten years in the
sterility of Opposition in a relatively
unimportant State would not benefit
the Labor Party. But, if he moved to
the Federal House, South Australian
ALP interests already in the national
Parliament would ensure that he went
on to the Labor front bench immediately
after his arrival.
But how heartily would Opposition
Leader Gough Whitlam welcome Dun-
stan to the Federal caucus?
There are those in the ALP who con-
sider Dunstan one of the best and most
able politicians in Australia. He has
handled his South Australian problems,
including the recent election result,
with dignity, capacity, and an effective
eye to seeing that Labor looked right,
and he is also a very good TV per-
former. When Adelaide women in one
of those public interrogations were
asked who, in their opinion, had the
most sex-appeal, Prime Minister Gorton
or Opposition Leader Whitlam, quite a
number placed Dunstan ahead of both.
There is another possibility that
could cause Whitlam some doubts about
the firmness of his hold upon Labor’s
leadership if he loses the next Federal
elections. Senator Lionel Murphy,
Labor Leader in the Senate, is seen by
some as having the qualities necessary
to strengthen Labor’s front ranks in the
House of Representatives and is being
urged to “do a Gorton” and step down
from the Senate to the Lower House.
This cannot happen immediately. But
at the next elections, due in 1969, there
will be a couple of good Sydney seats
going which could be picked up by
men prominent in ALP affairs. Mr.
Eric Costa (Banks) has told his elec-
toral council that he will not contest
the preselection again if the present
Parliament runs its full constitutional
term. Mr. Jim Harrison (Blaxland)
has not finally decided his plans. There
are also a couple of other possibilities.
The Murphy forces have already started
testing the atmosphere in one Sydney
constituency and they will probably
sample others.
With both Dunstan and Murphy in
the House of Representatives, the
present Deputy Leader, Lance Barnard,
and Dr. Jim Cairns would not be the
only potential successors to Whitlam in
the Labor leadership. Both Dunstan and
Murphy would move very firmly into
the picture.
South Australia
Disputed returns
WHEN THE Governor of South Aus-
tralia, Sir Edric Bastyan, accepted the
advice of his Ministers to issue an
early proclamation summoning Parlia-
ment on April 16, he followed clearly
established procedures. The fate of
the Dunstan Government will now be
determined by Parliament, the Court
of Disputed Returns it will set up, and
by the vote of the Independent mem-
ber for Ridley, Mr. Stott.
So far, the defeated candidate for
Millicent, Mr. Cameron, has announced
that he will petition for the Court and
its re-examination of 17 votes. There
is a strong possibility also that the de-
feated member for Murray and Minister
for Agriculture, Mr. Bywaters, will
petition, and so the real business of the
Parliament and possibly the final elec-
tion outcome will still not be known
for perhaps two weeks after Parliament
first sits.
The state of the parties is 19 all, and
the balance is held by Mr. Stott, who
may not wish to commit himself in a
vote of no-confidence before the Court
has ruled on the disputed seats. If
Labor argues effectively, holding Milli-
cent and winning back Murray, it would

govern in its own right. All of which
adds up to a continuing impasse, and
this can only help Mr. Dunstan in his
boundaries complaint.
The inconclusiveness of the election
has perhaps for the first time in 30
years made a great body of people
realise that the South Australian State
electoral boundaries constitute a quite
cynical gerrymander. The longer parties
and Parliament worry about who
should sit or be unseated, the louder
becomes the cry for honest electoral
reform.
In Adelaide, there is a great variety
of action among publicists and industrial
-groups with protest committees and
reform groups being formed and the
possibility of the Trades and Labor
Council endorsing direct industrial
action in the event of an LCL-Stott
Government, or the introduction of the
LCL’s new boundary scheme which will
favor the country vote. Even the more
liberal members of the Young Liberals
are giving their support to a democratic
rearrangement of boundaries, and so the
issue of electoral reform has become the
real and vital issue it should be.
Still, given that the Court of Dis-
puted Returns upholds the count of
votes as it now stands, it is freely con-
ceded that there is little hope of a
Dunstan Government for the next three
years. Mr. Stott, having been elected by
Labor preferences, has announced his
firm intention to support the Liberal
Country League, and in the position of
Speaker he would then have the casting
vote on which LCL Leader Mr. Hall
-would depend.
Only in electoral reform would Stott
vote independently, opposing the ALP’s
one-vote-one-value 56-member Assembly
and the LCL country-weighted 45-man
Assembly. Mr. Stott prefers a scheme
of proportional representation.
In this confusion most people and
the Press have forgotten about the
South Australian Upper House with its
restrictive property holder’s franchise
in which the city is represented by
eight members and the country by 12.
Newspapers are describing the whole
affair as a crisis and Vietnam is now
relegated to page three or four.
Stott.. . casting vote


The missing Australian
Did the Feather King's luck hold?
IS KEITH HYLAND alive? Probably
not, Australian security men in Saigon
were beginning to think, after 40 days
of pursuing false leads in South Viet-
nam’s frightened and tight-lipped capi-
tal. Then the first heartening piece of
evidence emerged. Buddhist monks
from a pagoda on Cholon’s Hau Giang
Street, one mile from the Saigon
Feather Mills, admitted that the Viet
Cong kept Keith Hyland and four
Chinese imprisoned in their pagoda for
two days.
The monks’ story checked out. They
were able to give an exact description
Interior of Hyland’s feather mill
of Hyland, calling him the “feather
man” and even referring to his preg-
nant wife. According to them, the VC
captured the Australian and put him
before a kangaroo court. Hyland sur-
vived the court and was then taken to
the pagoda along with the Chinese. The
monks said he was well treated, being
allowed to move about, but not leave
the pagoda. When the VC eventually
withdrew from Cholon, they took Hy-
land and the Chinese with them under
escort.
This was the breakthrough investiga-
tors had been hoping for, but not really
expecting. Gradually, they pieced to-
gether the Australian’s movements up
to the point of his removal from
Cholon. On the morning of February
6th, Keith Hyland looked out from his
apartment near the Australian Embassy
in the centre of Saigon, and saw fires in
the Cholon area where both his sister’s
house and his Saigon Feather Mills were
situated. Anxious for his sister, Mrs.
Rockwood, Hyland decided to run the
gauntlet of VC infiltrators and trigger-
happy ARVN troops.
He drove his Ford Zephyr toward
Mrs. Rockwood’s home, which is almost
adjacent to the Feather Mills. He suc-
ceeded in reaching a bridge which
crossed a small canal only a few hun-
dred yards from his destination. A
Viet Cong patrol halted Keith Hyland’s
car at this bridge. A Vietnamese wit-
ness says he heard the VC question
Hyland and refuse to allow him to go
any farther. They told him to leave
the area and not return.
Apparently, Hyland disregarded the
VC order and made a second attempt to
reach his sister via an alternative bridge
farther down the canal. Perhaps Hy-
land’s first encounter with the VC con-
vinced him that he was dealing with a
disciplined force, not bent on indiscri-
minate mayhem, and that a second try
could result in nothing worse than being
turned away again. But on the second
bridge, Keith Hyland’s luck tempor-
arily ran out. This time, according to
other witnesses, the VC took Hyland
out of his car and demanded to know
why he had disobeyed their instruc-
tions. They led him off in the direction
of the river where, it seems, the kan-
garoo court was held.
Three weeks after Hyland disap-
peared, investigations had not yet
ascertained even this much of his story.
The discovery of the Australian’s Ford
Zephyr during those three weeks only
deepened the mystery of his disappear-
ance. Benny Chow, Hyland’s business
partner, had returned from Bangkok
and begun his own inquiries. He found
the car, with a refugee family sleeping
inside, hidden under the bridge where
Hyland was captured. Chow reported
the find immediately, but the car was
gone by the time an MP jeep arrived
on the spot.
Later, the car was found again far-
ther up the canal bank. The refugee
family had vanished and could not be
traced for questioning. The strangest
fact in the finding of the car was that
a number of Keith Hyland’s personal
papers were still lying on the front
seat. By this time, investigating authori-
ties believed that the VC had either
summarily executed him or left him im-
prisoned in the area which they later
burned when attempting to cover their
withdrawal.
Rumors abounded during this period,
and talk of rewards stimulated the
already inventive Vietnamese imagin-
ation. Newspaper articles and reports
ranged from the ridiculous to the gro-
tesque. One, claiming to quote an Em-
bassy source, said Hyland was in the
hands of female Viet Cong.
Possibilities of finding Keith Hyland
alive continued to narrow, until the
Hau Giang monks decided to talk. This
raised the hopes of investigators, but
it presented them with an entirely new
set of questions. Given that Hyland left
the pagoda alive, did he and his escort
make it safely out of the Saigon Capital
Zone? Because of his earlier treatment,
authorities believed Hyland was in the
charge of senior VC officers and so
unlikely to be killed out of hand. Never-
theless, he could have perished in the
enormous bombardment rained down
on the retreating VC by American
planes and helicopter gun-ships.
Investigations are now proceeding on
the assumption that Keith Hyland is
alive and held by the Viet Cong in one
of their POW camps. Most of these
camps are nomadic and, consequently,
almost impossible to trace, but there are
a number of precedents which hold out
hope for Hyland’s return.
Hyland is not the first Australian to
disappear in such a manner in South
Vietnam. Seven years ago, at Ben Cat
between Saigon and the Cambodian
border, the Viet Cong kidnapped two-
Australian Colombo Plan dairy farmers.
Nothing was heard of them for some
time until a ransom note eventually
reached the Australian Embassy. A
Colombo Plan officer, the brother of
Asian specialist Brian Crozier, went out
to negotiate with the VC, who promptly
imprisoned him, too. However, the VC
finally exchanged the Australians for
medical supplies and typewriters. The
three men were well treated by villagers
as well as the VC.
If a ransom note does arrive for
Keith Hyland, it will probably come to-
the Australian Embassy via the Red
Cross, or some other neutral organisa-
tion. Negotiations, however, will be
more complex. Sometimes, as in the
Ben Cat episode, an agent has to meet
with the VC under circumstances which
they decide. At other times, a clandes-
tine American network is used. But this
organisation’s cover was blown rather
badly before Tet when Vietnamese
security police picked up a Viet Cong
on the way to a meeting with American
agents. Under interrogation, the VC
said his assignment was to negotiate
POW exchanges. Touchy Vietnamese
refused to believe this, and sparked off
widespread rumors accusing the Ameri-
cans of secretly preparing for a coalition
government with the Liberation Front
as a solution to their Vietnam predica-
ment. Since then, the American organi-
sation has been less active.
If neither of these channels is used,
there is one other. A contact is available
to the Embassy, who periodically flies
to Cambodia, where he happens to meet
the expatriate Australian Communist
Wilfred Burchett. Besides screening
journalists who want to enter China or
North Vietnam, Burchett frequently
operates as messenger for Hanoi and
the Liberation Front. POW exchanges
are sometimes negotiated in Cambodia
between Burchett and Embassy agents.


OVERSEAS
Westmoreland
Too straight for the part?
General William Westmoreland...chin squared against all adversity
IT IS hard to believe that any other
American general will be able to equal
General William Westmoreland as the
near-perfect four-star incarnation of the
moral purpose of the American mili-
tary mission in South-East Asia today.
His own very obvious personal belief
in the rightness of what he was doing,
in moral terms, has helped to draw
attention away from the fact that this
is the most impersonal war which
America has ever fought. When West-
moreland appeared in public, chin
squared against all adversity, one almost
had the vision of an American Army
mounted and bannered for a charge
into the infidel Communist hordes.
But, in fact, Westmoreland has dir-
ected since 1965 a masterly logistical
build-up which has allowed the Ameri-
cans to fight a vastly mechanical war.
Massive firepower, and not the indi-
vidual human soldier, has been the real
trademark of the Westmoreland war.
The big question Westmoreland
leaves behind him is whether or not his
strategy was the right one. Its aim was
to find and destroy the big Viet Cong
and North Vietnamese units, while
slowly giving security to more and
more peasants in the countryside.
Westmoreland’s critics in Saigon
point out v that this strategy underesti-
mated the strength and ingenuity of the
enemy. It is also arguable that he has
never really grasped the non-military
side of this war. He has gone on record
with the remark that he could find
no evidence of anything like a civil
war within South Vietnam.
It is also arguable that he is too
straightforward a man for such a
crooked war and for such a crooked
country as Vietnam. There was more
than a touch of ridiculousness about his
aggrieved charge that General Giap had
been “treacherous” by using the Tet
holiday to launch his massive attack.
It was a reaction typical of a man who
judges his opponent in moral terms.
In many ways since the Tet attack,
Westmoreland has been like a man who
has pushed his jaw out boldly for a
fight only to find that his little oppon-
ents have run round behind him and
tweaked him in the bottom.
Certainly this image does not do
justice to his abilities. But it has been
his misfortune to be a naturally
glamorous leader of men in a war which
on his side was really dominated by
machines and firepower, while daring
and cruel exploits of human ingenuity
and cunning have been left to the other
side.
The gold system
A race for trust
THE QUESTION is: will the two-
tier gold system work and, if so, for
how long?
When the seven central bankers
agreed at their Washington meeting not
to supply the private market, but de-
clared that, as the existing stock of
monetary gold was sufficient in view
of the prospective establishment of the
facility for special drawing rights, they
no longer felt it necessary to buy gold
from the market, they were saying, in
effect, “we need no more gold because
we are about to create a new paper
asset, the special drawing rights.”
It is not going to be easy, the posi-
tion is delicate. The narrower the gap
between the official price and the free
market price the greater the chance of
survival of the two-tier system. The
wider the gap the more unstable the
system.
Up until April, 1966, the copper pro-
ducers tried to maintain a low producer
price when the free market price had
gone through the roof. The scheme
finally broke when the price gap was
so huge that some users were buying
their quotas at the producer price and
reselling the copper on the free market.
The Chilean Government broke away
from the producers’ agreement by rais-
ing its price.
The dangers for the official gold price
are much the same. With only around
100 or so central banks able to get
gold at $35 an ounce, the gold price
will be easier to police than was the
copper agreement. But if the profit is
big enough it is staggering what can
be kept secret. Equally, if the free
market moved to a high price and
looked like staying there, it is difficult,
to believe that many central banks
would not revalue the gold in their
reserve. Once that happened an in-
crease in the price of monetary gold
could not be far behind.
The system’s first test is as close as
this Friday. Then the group of ten —-
the Treasury officials and central
bankers of the major industrialised
countries—meet in Stockholm to put
the final touches to the SDR (Special
Drawing Rights) scheme.
Despite General De Gaulle’s most
recent outburst against the pound and
the dollar, supporters of the scheme
point out that although France has
been hostile in public it has always,
in the end, approved each move toward
creating a man-made asset to supple-
ment gold. Much, of course, will
depend on the attitude taken by
Germany and Italy, but after the sup-
port they gave America a week ago,
France may well find itself isolated
and therefore impotent if it tries wreck-
ing tactics in Stockholm.
In the longer term the success of the
twoffier system rests on the American
balance-of-payments. At the moment
it shows all the signs of running wild.
But if, as seems certain, America cuts
back on home demand its imports will
fall and with them the export potential


of the rest of the world. Says one
banker: “The world must grin and
bear it.” In fact there is a good chance
that those Europeans with hefty
reserves would be prepared to go some
way to compensate for any reduction
in the American deficit. The com-
munique from the Washington meet-
ing said: “The Governments of most
continental European countries intend
to pursue monetary and fiscal policies
that encourage domestic expansion
consistent with economic growth.”
If all goes well, international trade
will ultimately rest on a combination
of gold, reserve currencies, and SDRs.
The prospect of getting rid of gold
altogether is remote. One banker puts
it no better than 20 to 30 years hence.
In the meantime, the sooner SDRs
begin to be used the less chance there
is of speculative attacks overthrowing
the present arrangements.
However, there are dangers in rush-
ing matters. Move too fast and govern-
ments may be disinclined to put their
trust in this new paper-money. None
the less, it is a race against time. The
day must come, probably in the late
’seventies, when industrial demand be-
gins to close up on production. If that
happened before SDRs were function-
ing smoothly, the price of gold would
rocket and the two-tier system fall
apart.
Britain
Waiting for gravy
MR. JENKINS’ Budget marks the
biggest somersault in the excessively
acrobatic history of Mr. Wilson’s Gov-
ernment. The elegance of Mr. Jenkins’
phrases to the House of Commons
should not be allowed to mask the fact
that almost every one was in flat con-
tradiction of practically everything that
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Callaghan have
said on economic affairs since October,
1964, and not least in the past year.
That they did not blush as their policies
were torn to pieces is not surprising:
members of this Government are inured
to that sort of thing by now. Nor is it
surprising that a large number of Labor
MPs cheered their heads off at the end
of the Chancellor’s speech. Their sense
of relief that confidence in a Minister
had not, for once, been misplaced was
shared by others outside Westminster.
And Mr. Jenkins, the cunning fellow,
had left his proposal for soaking the
rich until near the very end.
But when the immediate euphoria
has died away, as it will, those cheering
MPs might come to recognise that the
Budget has widened the Government’s
credibility gap. It may be that the
Government’s popularity, as measured
Jenkins leaving No. 10 Downing Street
last week. .. elegant contradictions
by the opinion polls, will show some
improvement in the next week or two.
If this happens and is due to the accept-
ance of the validity of the Budget by
a substantial number of electors, then
it should be welcomed for that reason
alone. Unfortunately, if it does happen
it is more likely to be a case of publicity
improving popularity. Mr. Jenkins
would certainly like to believe that his
intelligent economic strategy will strike
a response from that section of the
country which really wishes to see an
end to economic muddle and double
talk. But these are precisely the people
who will wonder why the miracle was
left until 1968, and did not happen last
year, or the year before, or the < one
before that. And might they not also
ask who saw the light in 1968?
It would be self-deception on the old
scale to pretend that the Budget is likely
to be met in the country with the recep-
tion it deserves. Of course it must be
hoped that the men in command of
industry and business do recognise the
strategy behind it all; the country is
sunk if they do not. But the majority
of ordinary people will look to their
own standard of living, and they will
not be filled with enthusiasm by the
growing evidence of its decline. In this
they will be aided and encouraged by
the Tory Party. So be it: that’s what a
two-Party political system is about. And
the Tories have doubt on their side. Mr.
Jenkins has promised the country two
years’ hard sacrifice before it can hope
to get at the gravy. But, remembering
the promises and confident assertions
that have gone before, who can blame
people if they do not quite believe
them? Mr. Wilson can’t, for one.
U.S. Presidential race
The machine won
NELSON ROCKEFELLER’S with-
drawal from the Presidential race,
announced last week, so calmly made,
so unexpected, virtually assures his
long-time political enemy, Richard
Rockefeller ... his dearest wish has
turned into an idle dream
Nixon, of the Republican Party
nomination.
Mr. Rockefeller’s career in Party
politics ’ began ten years ago when he '
won a resounding victory as Governor
of New York State. It came toward
its close on Thursday afternoon in a
ballroom of the New York Hilton
Hotel, where several hundred reporters
gathered to hear (as they thought) Mr.
Rockefeller declare himself a Presiden-
tial candidate, and left, bewildered, with
copies of his statement in their hands:
“I have decided today to reiterate
unequivocally that I am not a candi-
date campaigning, directly or indirectly,
for the Presidency of the United
States.”
Over the past few months the most
reliable national pollsters have consist-
ently shown Nelson Rockefeller to be
the Republican most likely to beat
Lyndon Johnson, always ahead of
Richard Nixon. On the surface, he had
everything going for him. .
One thing was lacking: the grass-
roots support of the local Republican
Party committee men in cities and
small towns across the country. Over
the past two years, Mr. Nixon has taken
time off from his New York law prac-
tice to speak at Republican rallies in
remote places, in support of small-time
candidates whom nobody but the locals
cared about.
But the little local officials will be
the delegates at the Party convention
so, once again, the" effort has paid off.
Once again it has been proved that
the Republican Party machine, un-
changing and unimaginative, cannot
accept the new type of Presidential
candidate whom the majority of its
members apparently want.
There is anger and dissension among
his supporters that Mr. Rockefeller
gave in so easily: they feel he should
have put up a fight. But in his two
earlier tries for the Presidency it was
the machine and not the masses which
defeated him.
There is no possibility now of Mr.
Rockefeller actively campaigning for
his Republican rival. Ironically, both
have homes in the same very expensive
Fifth Avenue apartment house, but if
they ever speak to each other, it is
merely in passing in the lift. The
Rockefeller flat is a sumptuous two-


storey affair, decorated with enough
works of modern art to stock a worth-
while public gallery, yet it is still the
smallest of the New York Governor’s
several residences.
In his sixtieth year, Mr. Rockefeller
would still dearly love to be President
of the U.S. He has left the door open
for a possible draft at the Convention
in August, and there is a very thin
sprinkling of his followers who feel this
strategy may work. Most political ob-
servers dismiss it as an ideal dream.
The probability is that Mr. Rockefeller
will continue to serve out his third
term as Governor of New York State,
and then retire from active politics.
The Communist World
Russia lays off
THE KREMLIN’S complete abandon-
ment of the Novotny leadership in
Prague has caused dismay in those
Communist hierarchies in East Europe
which depend on Soviet support: East
Germany, Poland, and Hungary.
The Yugoslavs, who enthusiastically
welcomed the peaceful political trans-
formation in Czechoslovakia, are now
expecting similarly radical changes in
East Berlin, Warsaw, and Budapest.
They believe that Moscow’s policy
vis-a-vis their East European allies has
changed, and that the Soviet leadership
will no longer intervene to prevent the
democratisation of the Communist
Parties in the rest of East Europe. This,
according to well-informed Yugoslav
circles, is a result of a bitter fight in
the Soviet Presidium during the leader-
ship crisis in Prague last December,
which ended with a decisive victory
for the liberal group led by Mr.
Kosygin, the Soviet Prime Minister.
The Rumanian Party Leader, Mr.
Nicolae Ceausescu, appeared at the
weekend to have given a starting signal
for a Rumanian liberalisation drive. Fie
announced that every Rumanian
“should be able freely to express his
views on the policies of the Communist
Party.”
The positions of Herr Ulbright, Mr.
Gomulka, and Mr. Kadar have become
precarious. In East Berlin, Warsaw, and
Budapest, the Presidium of the Com-
munist Parties held joint meetings last
Wednesday with their Central Commit-
tees. According to reports, they were
the stormiest since Mr. Khrushchev’s
revelation on Stalin’s crimes at the 20th
Soviet Party Congress in 1956.
The rank and file at all three meet-
ings called for immediate changes in the
Party leadership. At the Budapest meet-
ing it became apparent that Mr.
Kadar’s position is especially vulner-
able, for the Hungarian Communist
Party is the most disunited among all
East European Parties. There were also
demands for the immediate withdrawal
of Soviet troops.
Israel
Political assault
An Israeli soldier searches an Arab boy during the strike against Jordan
ON THURSDAY morning the Israelis
showed what the tough talk that had
been coming out of Israel last week was
all about. In a massive punitive attack,
Israeli troops moved into Jordan along
the length of the ceasefire line. The
object was to knock out the guerilla
bases; Iraeli Intelligence believes there
are between 600 and 800 al Fateh
guerillas operating from bases in
Jordan. If the operation also knocks
King Hussein off his throne, many
Israelis view this prospect with
equanimity. The way Israelis interpret
it, King Hussein’s removal would
simplify the Palestinians’ conflict of
loyalties. It would also place President
Nasser in a crippling dilemma: to stand
by while his colleague is overthrown
in the Arab cause or to plunge once
again in to war that he cannot win.
It makes sense to believe that political
rather than military considerations de-
termined this new major attack by
Israel. True, guerilla activities against
Israel have been on a larger scale since
the war last summer than they were
before. Since June, 1500 saboteurs have
landed in Israeli jails, 1000 of them
members of al Fateh. Altogether 90
saboteurs have been killed; Israeli and
Arab casualties through terrorist opera-
tions amount to 240 people injured or
killed. True, also, public opinion was
incensed by the recent mining of a
school bus near Eilat, which resulted
in two killed and 28 injured.
But the Israeli authorities, while not
dismissing al Fateh’s activities lightly,
have also not presented them as a
threat to the State. When it was politi-
cally expedient, Israel has in the past
been able to bear such attacks in silence.
Jordan is not a military power
warranting a heavy reprisal attack—and
Thursday’s attack was very much
heavier than the strike against Jordan
a month ago.
The answer may be that Israel is
making another bid to solve the Pales-
tinian conflict on its own and in its
own way. With the mission of Mr.
Jarring, the UN representative, grind-
ing to a halt, the Israelis, and, above all y
Mr. Dayan, the Minister of Defence,
are pinning their hopes on bypassing
the Arab Governments by creating some
kind of separate Palestinian State. The
al Fateh raids militate against this.
Plence the decision to try to crush the
guerilla bases.
A procession of West Bank dignitaries
have recently been permitted by the
Israeli authorities to visit Arab capitals.
The latest of these is Mr. Hamdi
Ranaan, the Mayor of Nablus, who
earlier last week was at a meeting in
Beirut of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, the political arm of al
Fateh. One explanation why the
Israelis agreed to these visits is that
they hoped the West Bankers would
argue to their fellow Palestinians that
the raids were harmful to Palestinian
interests. At the Beirut meeting it was
apparently decided to co-ordinate poli-
tical and military activity. This sug-
gests that the political wing of the
resistance movement may perhaps be
gaining the upper hand.
While touring West Bank towns last
month Mr. Dayan offered the local
authorities self-rule as soon as they
were ready to undertake it. He even
promised arms to local inhabitants for
self-defence against al Fateh raids if
their leaders would give an assurance
that these arms would not be misused.
This is moving ahead of the situation,
but it indicates the way some Israelis
are thinking.
Post-confrontation
Malik's subtleties
THE VISIT to Singapore of Indonesia’s
Foreign Minister, Adam Malik, this
week raised more questions than it
answered. To be sure there was some
substance in his visit, even though the
joint communique issued at its end was
a classic of cliche. Malik was in Singa-
pore continuing the post-confrontation
dialogue, the last effective event within
which was Singapore Foreign Minister
Rajaratnam’s visit to Djakarta last
September.
Indonesians tend to be impatient with


the fact of the lingering suspicions they
themselves aroused during the crush-
Malaysia days, but at least Malik has
not been remiss in trying to reassure.
Arriving in Singapore he once again
stressed that Indonesia would have no
objections to the retention of British,
Australian, New Zealand, Malaysian,
and Singapore defence arrangements.
For some observers the question is more
whether Singapore does enough to come
to terms with her largest potential
market, and in this regard it is felt
Lee Kuan Yew should not delay too
long in going to Djakarta himself.
On defence matters, as Malik clari-
fied his position and then unclarified
it, ASEAN defence togetherness seemed
very distant and what precisely is the
Indonesian regional view became that
much more difficult to divine. On the
one hand, Malik agreed with the Singa-
pore leaders’ view that ASEAN is, in the
words of the communique, “for co-
operation in economic, social, and cul-
tural fields.” Rajaratnam signified
Malik’s agreement that “ASEAN as
ASEAN should not be called upon to
solve defence problems as well . . .
ASEAN should not be made a vehicle
for resolving our defence problems. It
could be made outside of ASEAN in
such a way and manner as members find
convenient and suitable.” For Singa-
pore’s Foreign Minister, if defence was
included in ASEAN affairs “we may get
into serious difficulties.”
At a Press conference Malik signified
his agreement with this thesis, but re-
fused to be drawn on whether this was
a final position or not. Meanwhile
addressing Indonesian residents here in
Singapore Malik sounded a seemingly
different note. Fie said that Indonesia
was prepared to defend Singapore and
Malaysia against any Communist
threat after the British withdrawal.
“The 200 million people represented
in ASEAN need not worry about any
Communist threat. We shall protect
them even if the threat comes from
Genghis Khan,” he was reported as
saying.
Since this is a scarcely veiled refer-
ence to the Mongoloid race it was ironic
to say the least that Malik later in the
same speech referred to the people of
Singapore, especially the Chinese, as
being not fully confident yet of the
new Indonesian Government. Malik
and the Indonesians are admittedly
in a dilemma to say nothing on
defence matters may be undesirable
while to say too much will scarcely
help in Malik’s words in “eliminating
the fears of the Singapore people
toward Indonesia.” As he himself did
both, Malik also succeeded in enhanc-
ing “fears” as to his own future.
For one thing the Singapore visit
was hurriedly arranged at the last
minute. For another Malik had sud-
denly left Djakarta just before the
Tunku arrived, which seemed strange
even though the “excuse” was that
Malik was going on a pilgrimage to
Mecca. His visits to Bangkok and
Singapore took place on the way back
from becoming a Haji.
Further, there would seem to be
some discrepancy between Malik’s
views and the reported ones of Suharto
on defence. Certainly there is a gap
between the Indonesian Foreign Minis-
try view with its vestigial commitment
to non-alignment and Indonesian de-
fence thinking with its commitment to-
ward commitment. Whether one can go
further and deduce that Malik is “on
his way out” or likely to have diminish-
ing influence remains to be seen.
Like his predecessor, Dr. Subandrio,
he is without a political base, having
disconnected himself from his old
Murba Party. The signs point to more
Army, not civilian, control of Indo-
nesian affairs. It will be interesting to
see whether Suharto’s planned Cabinet
reshuffle confirms this trend and
where it leaves Malik.
Conceivably the Bangkok and Singa-
pore visits were partially designed to
buttress Malik’s position. Meanwhile
the numerous unanswered questions
over Singapore-Indonesian economic
relations make an interesting reflection
on Indonesia’s overall position. Smug-
gling, the occasional arrests of Singa-
pore fishermen in inadequately defined
territorial waters, the problems of the
barter trade and joint action against
small-scale piracy no doubt these
problems were raised between Malik
and the Singapore leaders. But in the
continuing absence of effective admini-
strative implementation within Indo-
nesia’s wide boundaries, Malik was
unable to offer anything more con-
structive than the prospect of more
talks.
Malaysia
Who's up to what?
VERBAL WAR has broken out be-
tween Malaysia and the Philippines.
Disclosures in Manila last week re-
vealed that a secret training camp had
been discovered on Corregidor, that
there was a mutiny within the camp as
a result of which an indeterminate
number of trainees died. It was also
alleged that the trainees were Musliks
speaking the dialect of the Southern
Philippines—and of Sabah—and that
their uniforms bore a strong resem-
blance to Malaysian uniforms.
The Malaysian action was swift and
severe. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs
statement issued late Saturday indicated
that a firm protest had been made to
the Philippine Government, which had
been requested “to give full explana-
tion of such activities.”
The statement added that the per-
manent Malaysian representative at
the United Nations had been asked to
bring the matter to the attention of
the Secretary-General.
Promptly, if myopically, a Filipino
Foreign Ministry statement on Sunday
claimed that the Corregidor dis-
closures were “an internal matter” and
that taking the matter to the United
Nations would not be “in the interests
of friendly relations.” The statement
indicated there was no intention to
violate Malaysian territory.
On Saturday morning the readers of
the Malaysia-Singapore “Straits Times”
awoke to the headline “Plot to start a
war over Sabah.” The report gave
prominence to Senator Almendra’s
allegation in the Filipino Senate late
Thursday night that the Corregidor
secret camp “was being used to . trigger
a war between North Borneo and the
Philippines.”
Not surprisingly, if somewhat apolo-
getically, Malaysian Deputy Prime Min-
ister Tun Razak then replied that
“Malaysia has no intention of severing
friendly relations,” that Malaysian
actions were “normal moves under
present circumstances.”
Certainly developments on both sides
of the South China Sea have been as
one might expect. Given the fact that
despite his professed intentions, Presi-
dent Marcos retains the Sabah claim
and that for quite a while the Malay-
sians have believed that two islands in
the southern-most Philippines were also
being used as training and jumping-off
points for infiltrators, the Malaysians
remained suspicious, even when Presi-
dent Marcos claimed that the Corregi-
dor secret camp was for training in
counter subversion against the Com-
munists who are vaguely rumored to be
“working up” the Mindanao masses.
However, President Marcos could
now use the reaction he has aroused in
Malaysia to prove to the people from
whom he expects re-election that the
Sabah claim is eminently droppable.
Unhappily, this week’s eruption has
blown away most of the goodwill
created by Razak’s visit to Manila last
December and Marcos’ visit to Malaysia
last January. Right now Malaysia-
Philippines relations are the most deli-
cate relationship to Australia’s near
north.

The first
Wyndham
products
By APRIL HERSEY
SINCE 1954, there has, in New South
Wales, been a Wyndham plan which
proposed a six-year secondary-school
course instead of the old five, with new
subjects to be studied, and with new
complications in levels at which sub-
jects may be studied. Now, in 1968,
there is a Wyndham product, students
who have been through this obstacle
course and now find themselves over-
coming the obstacles set up by the uni-
versities for entrance or the obstacles of
making their way in the business and
industrial world at the age of 18 or 19,
way beyond the normal junior-recruit-
ing level.
About 18,300 students sat for the
Higher School Certificate, and it was
almost a 100-percent pass, simply be-
cause a certificate is given if only one
subject is passed at any of the three
levels. However, matriculation is
another matter. It is estimated that
about 10,000 students have entered the
New South Wales universities, but as
some applied for more than one, there
is still a bit of cross-checking to do to
get the final figure.
All the New South Wales universities
set up complicated matriculation re-
quirements, although some, notably
Macquarie University, Sydney, seem to
have fitted themselves to the spirit of
the Wyndham plan better than others.
It would take, said an Education De-
partment spokesman, a sheet of foolscap
to set out each university’s stipulations.
Entrance requirements for diploma
courses at technical and other colleges
can be almost as intimidating.
However, the way ahead for those
who do not plan to go to a university is
hardly easier. There is one school of
thought that they should not have gone
beyond four years of secondary school,
while Dr. Wyndham, the director of
education and originator of the plan,
clings to the idea of the six-year course
as essential for full development of the
individual. To those who stay at school
to achieve full development, business-
houses and industry may cry: “Too old,
too old.”
All this might suggest that the Wynd-
ham plan is defeated almost before it
has begun. This is not so, but there
must now be a period of adjustment, not
so much for the students as for the
waiting world.
The University of Sydney announced
difficult matriculation requirements and
created such bad publicity that students
were frightened off. Subsequently, the
Lniversity had to take a second bite
at filling quotas when of the 5300
letters sent out to fill 4450 vacancies
only 3700 were finally accepted by
students. This meant that another 700
letters had to be sent out luring back
previously rejected students in order
to fill the ranks of Arts, Economics, and
Science.
At Macquarie, the halls are noisy
with 1950 new students. They wander
round the grounds basking in open air
and the luxury of flexible tuition where
they can combine poetry and engineer-
ing if they wish. Unconcerned with
“levels” at which the students matricu-
lated, and placing no specific emphasis
on certain subjects, Macquarie Uni-
versity has proved a haven to the sorely
tried guinea pigs of the Wyndham
scheme.
The Vice-Chancellor of Macquarie
University, Professor A. G. Mitchell, is
impressed with the quality of their
passes at the Higher School Certificate
and waits with some interest to see how
they will perform.
“We have a ‘wait and see’ attitude
here because we don’t really know
what they are capable of doing. We
had three separate consultations with
groups of teachers from the secondary
schools to see if they thought we should
redesign the first year curriculum, since
the group produced by a different pat-
tern of education may need something
different. But our final decision was
no. I think we can be fairly sure that
they will be capable of doing indepen-
dent work, thinking for themselves, and
studying efficiently—beyond that we
can’t be sure.
“Many of these young people discuss-
ing the past six years with me feel they
have been experimental animals subject
to uncertainty and stress. I wanted to
get rid of this idea. I assured them
that education is really not like that,
not at university level, anyway. I told
them to relax and start again. We are
quite confident of what we want to
teach them at this stage of their
development.”
Professor S. T. Butler in the School
of Physics at the University of Sydney
is proceeding with some excitement.
“There are more science students than
we have had previously, and, though we
can only speak before the event, it does
look like a good year,” he said.
It had better be. The University’s
Physics syllabus has been completely
rewritten at a higher level. Passes in
both maths and science were pre-
requisites for Physics 1A and Physics
18, though Physics 18, designed to serve
engineering and medicine, did not re-
quire the full second level but accepted
the shorter version of the course.
Physics 1C has vanished.
“In previous years things were rather
more general,” Professor Butler said.
“We were always faced with several
hundred students enrolled for medicine
who had never studied physics and
chemistry before. This is not possible
now.”
That some able students have failed
to get into tertiary institutions is pos-
sibly because of one word.
“We should never have used the word
‘levels.’ ” Dr. Wyndham, talking to a
WEA group in Sydney’s eastern sub-
urbs, gave the impression of a reason-
able man supremely tired of trying to
explain something simple to a world
insisting that it is difficult. He was
replying to the question: “Are the uni-
versities by their demands negating the
success of the secondary-school
pattern?”
He replied: “Each level is a com-
prehensive course. Each is equally valu-
able. In each the standard is much the
same. What varies is the depth of re-
search and interest. Therefore, a person
destined to teach science, and deeply
interested in it, would be better advised
and, in fact, would naturally prefer to
do Level I in maths and science, the
highest level, because he can delve more
deeply inKp it. He may not know more
about the basic subject than the person
doing the full courses at Level 11. But
it is very hard to convince the universi-
ties of this.”
Dr. Wyndham has been “preaching
the gospel” since 1954, when he first
■chaired a committee of eminent educa-
tionists to inquire into the school sys-


tem, lifted holus-bolus from Scotland
in 1911. The new scheme is no newer
than anything else under the sun. It
was developed from the report of the
Hadow Committee in 1927 on the edu-
cation of adolescents in England. But by
1957, new or old, the Wyndham Report
was tabled for consideration by State
Parliament. It was ordered to be print-
ed, and, presumably, forgotten. Dr.
Wyndham was determined it would not
gather dust in a pigeonhole. Apart from
the foolscap printing, traditional but an
awkward size for reading, he had an
octavo printing produced, available to
the public at a dollar a copy. Since
that time it has been re-issued three
times.
The Wyndham plan established a six-
year secondary-school course (which
was hardly revolutionary; New South
Wales was only catching up with a lot
of other places, including Victoria).
The course is divided into two parts,
one of four years with a School Certifi-
cate at the end of it, the other of two
years with a Higher School Certificate
at the end of it, instead of the previous
five years with the Intermediate at the
end of third year and the Leaving at
the end of five.
In the first four years a student gets
a general secondary education with a
“core” of English, Mathematics,
Science, Social Studies, Art, Music, with
a gradual increase in optional subjects,
such as languages, and some advanced
study in “core” subjects.
The first year is largely exploratory,
after which each subject is pursued at
two levels. The two levels are an
amendment to the original plan; three
were intended. For fifth and sixth form
there are three levels, and, in some
subjects, both short and full courses.
Dr. Wyndham, rocking back and
forth in an old wooden swivel chair
in his office beyond the clanking orna-
mental lifts of the Department of Edu-
cation, surrounded by piles of official
documents tied up with faded red tapes,
is reticent about the delays that held
back his idea for four years.
“We don’t know all the details. And
we won’t ever know why there were
such delays.” At this time Dr. Wynd-
ham was determinedly carrying the
message to Parents and Citizens’ meet-
ings, Headmasters’ Conferences, and
schools.
He advocated working out prelimin-
ary patterns and tackling the exercise
of programming to find out how time-
tables would work. So zealous was he
in his mission that when he asked one
conference of headmasters on the North
Coast if they would come prepared to
question him on the possible shortcom-
ings and problems of the scheme they
all arrived with timetables and
schedules for their schools, though the
implementation of the scheme was then
highly improbable.
The person who made it possible was
Mr. Ernie Wetherell, who rather
startled the quiet Wyndham with his

New South Wales
forthright tackling of a hedged-round
subject. Pile-driving away at opposi-
tion, Wetherell, as New South Wales
Minister for Education, swept the re-
port before the House, and, in October,
1961, after debate, it was decided to
start the scheme at the beginning of
1962.
Dr. Wyndham said: “I myself would
have hoped for an earlier decision and
twelve months notice before the intro-
duction. As it was there was a great
rush to get an interim syllabus out and
great demands placed on teachers.”
Ple feels that they rose magnificently
to the occasion but admits that for some
who resisted the whole scheme the only
cure will be their eventual retirement.
“Some of the difficulties we have had
would have happened in any school sys-
tem during the past six years. After
Sputnik, the syllabus had to be radically
revised in maths and science, in fact,
the text books still cannot keep ahead
of developments.
“Also it is like putting a new carpet
in a room. You decide you need new
curtains and furniture. So we revised
the whole curriculum and that set new
problems. But already, after having
seen three years’ results of the four-
year School Certificate course, there
is definitely a new atmosphere in the
classroom. There is more enthusiasm
and zest; teachers have new opportuni-
ties; individuals can attempt courses
that are challenging but not unreason-
able.”
Dr. Wyndham is as intrigued as any-
one to know just what sort of a product
has emerged. During the past year he
has “dropped in” on sixth-years around
the State, sitting on the edges of desks
and chatting informally. “They aren’t
pupils any more. They are young Aus-
tralians. I don’t find them at all brash
or immature. I am very much at home
with this group, having taught the col-
lege-age group at a Sydney teachers’
college myself. Though some have not
done as well as we might have expec-
ted, they have a very responsible atti-
tude. They are an interesting group.”
The vexed question of matriculation
is irrelevant to Dr. Wyndham, though
he hopes that “everyone will see reason
in time.”
“It merely means entry to a uni-
versity. I am always irritated when
someone goes to great lengths to plan
a good well-balanced course of study
for a boy or girl and then the parent


peers over the shoulder and says: ‘But
will he matriculate?’ It’s like the story
of the industrialist who hired a specialist
for a top job and said as he was leav-
ing: ‘I assume you’ve matriculated?’
Shocked, the man replied: ‘I am an
M.A. from Oxford!’ ‘Well, I don’t give
a damn about that tell me if you
have matriculated?’ ”
The greatest emphasis of education
under the Wyndham scheme is, accord-
ing to its author, to recognise talent
and foster greater maturity. To Dr.
Wyndham himself the highest point
since the beginning of it all in 1954
was when a youngster at a prize-giving
won the first prize for English and
subsequently reappeared to carry off
first prize for Craft.
“He wouldn’t have had a chance of
working with his hands under the old
system. Joan Sutherland didn’t have a
chance to study music. I like to think
of a boy doing Greek and metalwork.”
The additional year remains the main
point of controversy in the whole plan.
First year is uncommitted. This doesn’t
mean it isn’t busy. But a first-year
student is not forced into a stream from
which he cannot vary, at a standard
from which he cannot budge, at the age
of twelve.
“It isn’t really the first year that is
additional, or the sixth,” Dr. Wyndham
commented. “It’s the fourth.” He is
enormously proud that, for the first
time in Australia’s history, half the
population of secondary schools are
staying on to fourth year in N.S.W. In
1948, nine percent did four years’
secondary school; las': year it was 53
percent.
Mr. R. N. Crawford, Principal of
North Sydney Bovs’ High School and
President of the Headmasters’ Council
as well as being active on the Board
of Senior School Studies now examin-
ing every aspect of the first six years,
sees secondary education as a develop-
ing pattern.
“The community outgrows certain
patterns of education and new ones
must be tailored to suit. There is more
breadth and depth in the present senior
course and it presents a better bridge
to tertiary education. The students can
search and re-search under direction.
All that is very good.”
But he is not so sure of the un-
committed first year. “I don’t think
the poor little dears suffered so much
for being thrown into the mainstream
of secondary schooling. The way it is
now this diagnostic year doesn’t touch
on languages. They still have to do that
in five years. I think they should still
be allowed to settle down finally in
second year, but first year should be
a time to try everything. In that way,
no time is wasted.”
Though Dr. Wyndham cannot make
statements while he is still working
on the problem (he appears, at least in
theory, to favor universities setting
their own entrance examinations if
they are not prepared to accept the
results of the Higer School Certificate),
Mr. Crawford feels that it is to the
benefit of the community for the final
school examination to be an acceptable
yardstick for any tertiary training. “The
matriculation problem has arisen now
because the previous system was so
uniform and this is flexible. But a tenta-
tive solution can surely be found.
Reasonable requirements should be the
only measure.
“Rigid demands for certain levels
on the part of the universities are quite
counter to the theory of individual
development. Because a clever young-
ster knows what the university demands,
his natural bent, the thing we hope tQ.
develop, is immediately squashed back
into uniformity. Of course, he can pass
the levels demanded. But it might have
been better for him to do the ones
he wanted to do. Better for him and
better for the university.”
Mr. Crawford believes that those
who are not interested in tertiary edu-
cation should finish school at fourth
year. “Obviously can be a liability
for bovs and girls in many areas, par-
ticularly industry. The last two years
offer advanced training, almost a pre-
specialisation, particularly in 2nd-level
maths and science and 2nd-level Eng-
lish. The idea that the first volunteers
in the scheme are some sort of noble
young people attempting to navigate
a difficult and unknown course, for
whom all doors should open, just isn’t
true. I think it is better for them to
avoid risking a situation where they
may be unwanted. I like to advise the
boys here that if they are not academi-
cally inclined they should think care-
fully. They can still improve their edu-
cation within the framework of the job
they take, and they haven’t lost precious
time.”
Although there has been endless
discussion about matriculation and the
problems of those entering university
and other tertiary institutions, the
troubles of those who have not are
hardly less. Although Dr. Wyndham is
pleased that many more students are
doing four years’ secondary school, he
can hardly be pleased that fewer, in
fact, are doing five. (In 1966, the last
year of the Leaving, 28.7 percent of
pupils were getting five years’ second-
ary education; in 1967, the first year of
the Upper School Certificate, 24.6
were.) For many parents, who prob-
ably did the Leaving themselves, four
years’ secondary school does not seem
enough preparation for work or life.
Will they, or should they, fall in with
the suggestion that fifth and sixth forms
are only for those who intend going to
university?
In the first batch there were cer-
tainly students who tried and failed to
matriculate; they themselves or their
parents or school, over-estimated their
capacity. For two years’ extra education
in some fields they find that at 18 or 19
they begin on exactly the same salary
as someone with a School Certificate.
However, some business firms and in-
dustries make allowance for education.
If the Wyndham plan has to shake
down at the universities there will un-
doubtedly also be adjustments in busi-
ness and industry, with, in time, some
callings that traditionally required the
Leaving no longer doing so but others
being prepared to pay more for people
with six years’ secondary schooling.
“The crop has really just hit the
market,” said a spokesman for the
Commonwealth Employment Centre.
“Those who have matriculated are wel-
come as cadets in many areas, such as
the Water Board, oil companies. For
the non-matriculates it is not so easy.
The basic course of study is broad, but
the importance of levels leads to con-
fusion. The prospect tells us the subjects
he has studied, and at what level, but
it leaves you wondering if he could have
studied at the higher levels.”
A comment which will probably cause
Dr. Wyndham to drop his head in his
hands in despair.
But the question of age may always
be a difficult one. Too old for a trade
and not accepted by tertiary institu-
tions, the Wyndham products in some
cases may have to become self-made
men to justify their education.
The blond boy walking under the
umbrellas at the University of Sydney
being invited to join SUDS or to fight
conscription was irritated by the dis-
covery that the last Leaving Certificate
class, once just a year ahead, is now
entering third-year university. “I used
to know this other boy well. I’ve known
him since I started school. You know,
kindergarten and upper first—way back
there. He’ll be in practice while I’m still
at university.”
The educationists might comment
that the first boy probably won’t do as
well as the second when they are finally
both practising law.
The red-haired girl in a mini-skirt
discussed orientation: “I went to this
lecture about studying. I wonder how
they think we got here! They told us
the most basic stuff about working and
timing and so forth. We all sat there
stunned. This lecturer seemed to think
he was bringing us the word. He told
us how to write an essay, too. I felt as
though he was talking from a script
someone had left over from some other
show.”
The emergence of this first Wyndham
product is something of a dream come
true to its author, now approaching
retirement, who “won’t have time now
for two or three other things I had in
mind.” But he is quick to realise the
shortcomings. “Nothing is perfect. Only
a fool would be satisfied.”
Nothing about the scheme is con-
sidered final and irrevocable. Since its
inception it has always been an epic
of flexibility.
To the guinea pigs, despite a certain
amount of bewilderment and a shortage
of books as writers tried to meet dead-
lines, it is generally conceded by all
that it was “interesting and a lot of
fun.” Perhaps their attitude is best sum-
med up by a farewell card sent by one
departing class to Dr. Wyndham. He
keeps it in the top drawer of his desk
and it reads:
THANKS DR WIN DAM IT’S
BEEN LUVERLY BIT LONG
BUT!


Writing for dear life
By
SANDRA
HALL
TONY MORPHETT, Craig Mc-
Gregor, and Thomas Keneally are
writers working mainly in the chancy
field of fiction; all belong to a fairly
vulnerable economic group: the young
married man with a family. Beyond
that, perhaps all they have in com-
mon is that each has now taken his
courage and his typewriter in both
hands and, helped by the Common-
wealth Literary Fund, is working full-
time at writing.
Craig McGregor’s progress toward
his first novel has been inevitable, but
halting. It’s always been in his mind,
but the confidence to undertake it has
been bought piece by piece with the
publication of a variety of non-fiction
books.
“What easier step into writing could
you take than to ghost a book?” he
says, taking from a bookshelf a copy
of “This Surfing Life,” a profile
of surfboard champion Midget
Farrelly, written in 1965. “I’d
always wanted to write about
surfing. This took the place of
the ‘Death in the Afternoon’ type
of book I was originally going to
do,” he adds, looking wry at
the thought.
“Profile of Australia,” a factual
study of Australian society writ-
ten over four years while he was
still working on the “Sydney
Morning Herald,” followed in
1966, and this book provided him
with the springboard of a six-
month Commonwealth Literary
Fund grant to work on his novel.
But meanwhile the non-fiction
titles have gone on “People,
Politics, and Pop” a collection
of essays, “The High Country,”
a handsome pictorial study of the
Snowy Mountains, for which he
wrote the text, and “Life in Aus-
tralia,” for which he edited the
text and wrote some contri-
butions.
“I left the ‘Plerald’ to get the
time to work on the novel, but
all the time I’ve been on a tightrope
between freelancing and books, the
time for books balanced against what
sort of money I could earn out of
freelancing.
“You could probably earn a full-time
living out of non-fiction books if you
were prepared to write on anything
and do one or two books a year. I’m
approached every few weeks by a pub-
lisher to write on an idea. But I only
do what I’m really interested in, other-
wise I might as well still be in journa-
lism.”
The idea for “Profile of Australia”
came to him when he was in London
in 1962. He put it to a publisher, think-
ing he could complete the book in a
year. The publisher showed interest and
McGregor came back to Australia to
tackle it in his spare time. “That was a
lot tougher than I thought it was going
to be. I got quite a lot of co-operation
academics were helpful, showing me
unpublished manuscripts. Nevertheless
it took four years.”
It has been published in the U.K.
and the United States, and a Penguin
edition comes out later this year. “This
Surfing Life” is also being published in
the U.S. and in paperback in the next
few months.
McGregor finally stepped off the free-
lance tightrope temporarily last year,
when he and his wife, Jane, put their
house in Woollahra up for letting, and
took their three children to Byron Bay
on the N.S.W. north coast for six
months.
There he availed himself of the CLF
grant to work' uninterrupted on his
novel, returning late last year with the
Craig McGregor. .. anti-Somerset Maugham
final draft completed. Between freelance
jobs, he is revising it now. '
“You could say it’s anti-Somerset
Maugham, in that it’s anti his belief
that everything must have a beginning,
a middle, and an end. There are lots
of changes in the time sequences, and
it’s not always clear what comes first
or later. I think I’ve been influenced
by films a lot. It flashes backwards and
forwards, as films do.
“I’ve put things up against one
another in a kind of collage, because for
a long time now I’ve found something
vaguely dissatisfying about reading con-
ventional novels. They don’t hold my
interest.
“Life isn’t just going forward you
project yourself into imaginary situa-
tions, old images flash through, and you
get a jumble of things. There’s that sort
of feeling in the book.
“It’s about Australians who go over-
seas, come back, and have to come to
terms with life in Australia again. But
its main concern is the educated woman
in suburbia. I deliberately chose a
woman as the main character she’s a
Pymble housewife who’s gone overseas,
and come back and had children
because I think it’s disastrous to get too
personal in writing a novel. This way
I can stay detached to some extent.”
The first draft came easily to
McGregor. He doesn’t spend time
agonising over phrases, instead has no
compunction in leaving spaces to be
filled in later.
“I used to work for three or four
hours in the morning at Byron Bay,
then when I felt nothing more was com-
ing I’d go down to the beach and surf.
It’s now that I’m feeling all the
indecision giving things their
final place. But on the whole
I feel better about it than I
thought I would. It’s the final
breakthrough.
“A writer’s got to have the
obsession. I don’t care how much
talent he’s got he’s no good
without the obsession.” Tony
Morphett is sitting in the Mel-
bourne office of Jacaranda Press
surrounded by illustrations of
bottlebrush and looking larger
than life, unavoidable when
you’re six feet six, bearded, and
have a penchant for denim and
riding boots.
He has proved his ownvpoint
about “obsession,” surviving the
shattering experience of having
his second novel pulped two days
before publication date because
of a threatened libel action and
bouncing back with a sizable third
novel, “Dynasty,” which has
been well reviewed and is enjoy-
ing good sales.
“I was angry when ‘Fitzgerald’
was pulped, but I think every
experience is worth something, and that
one probably made me work harder
on ‘Dynasty.’ I still love ‘Fitzgerald’—
I spent 18 months on it. Somehow I’ll
get it published one day with a
different title, of course, but it’s not
dead. Actually, the character in the
book bears no relation at all to the
person who was bringing the libel
action. Unfortunately, he happened to-
have the same name as my character,
something I didn’t know when I wrote
the book.”
Partly as a reaction to the pulping
of “Fitzgerald,” Morphett made
“Dynasty’s” characters, who are news-
paper tycoons, anonymous.
“I suppose I was gun-shy. After all,
there aren’t many newspaper families


in Australia, and this novel had got
to be very important to me.”
Morphett is 20,000 words into his
fourth novel, for which he has been
awarded a six-month CLF grant, and
after ten years at the ABC as a radio
and television interviewer he resigned
lhst year to give all his time to writing.
“There are times when you have to
bet on yourself, and when I sold
‘Dynasty’ through my- agent in the U.S.
it took me just a week to decide to
quit. The thing that really did it was
when I thought, if I waited another
five years I’ll get 4| months’ long ser-
vice leave. When I found myself think-
ing that, I said jump; or you’ll never
do it.”
Morphett’s new novel, “Noman,” is
set in another anonymous Australian
city with a time leap from the Korean
War, when the hero is 20, to the Viet-
nam War, when he is 35, and mirrors
the change in Australian attitude to
these two wars.
“Although the Korean War was an
entirely different war from the Vietnam
one, I do think there’s been a tremen-
dous change in thinking. There was
absolutely no questioning during
that war. But this is just a peg
on which to hang events in the
novel. There are other histori-
cal analogies. For instance, the
hero is on the outskirts of a
witch-hunt while he is at uni-
versity. One of his professors gets
involved in McCarthy-type per-
secution just as Socrates was con-
demned for corrupting the youth
of Athens. I’ve used incidents
which parallel history like that.”
Used to working at weekends
and during his spare time, Mor-
phett has been writing a com-
pulsive nine hours a day since
he left the ABC. “Friends who’ve
been writing longer tell me this
is too much and that I’ll gradu-
ally settle into three or four
hours a day, but at the moment
I go mad if I’m doing nothing.”
He plans to freelance for the
ABC and is moving to Sydney
shortly to facilitate this, but
“having retired at 29 I don’t want
to go back to work altogether.”
He will, he says, be out of
money a year from now if nothing else
happens, but the CLF grant has bought
him time, so, as he sees it, it’s up to
him to make something happen.
“I was in two minds about applying
for a grant, because I have a basic
distrust of governments. I don’t trust
big business, either, but there are more
of them and you can change one for
the other. But I know you wouldn’t
have a lot of things if you didn’t have
subsidies and the Government seems
to administer these grants benevolently.
There are no strings attached.
“When you’re writing a book it’s
a child, when you’re finished it it’s a
commercial property. I’m happy with
an Australian publisher, but there is a
tremendous pressure on Australian
writers to go to overseas publishers
because they can often get overseas pub-
lication much more easily. And I don’t
think you could work full-time as a
writer just selling in Australia. Why
should you have to?”
Morphett has been writing since his
schooldays, beginning with poetry and
some abortive attempts at verse plays.
Leaving university after a year (“be-
cause I couldn’t face talking about the
same things with the same people for
the next five years”), he joined the
“Daily Telegraph,” and from there to
the ABC as a trainee in the Talks
Department. At weekends, he wrote a
children’s play and the draft of his
first novel, “Mayor’s Nest,” which he
took to the manager of Jacaranda Press
in Brisbane.
“I dropped it on his desk; he picked
it up and said, ‘lt’s not heavy enough,’
and I said I wasn’t going to make it
any heavier until he told me he was
going to publish it.”
A year later, when he was working
on “Fitzgerald,” he was told they
wanted it, and after he expanded it
“Mayor’s Nest” was published in 1964.
“It was a terrific psychological boost.
Tony Morphett ... nine hours a day
I think Australia lost a generation of
novelists just after the war, because no
one was willing to make an investment
in them. It gives you so much more
confidence in your writing. Of course,
there are no guarantees of success, even
if you do well at first.
“Once you get over the feeling that
life is a movie and you’re the hero,
you start to sweat. It happened to me
a few months ago on this novel. I had
the character, but not the shape. And
if you can’t get that right there’s no
point going on. But I got through it,
and at the same time got ideas for two
more novels . . . they’re there, crystal-
line.”
He has what he describes as a puritan
compulsion to put the date in the
margin each day when he begins to
write. On a good day he has covered
3000 words, on a bad day the same
page has borne three different dates.
The earlier parts of his novels are
always rewritten heavily. The results,
he says, of not knowing his characters
well enough at the start. “I find the
only way is to go ahead and write then,
getting to know them better as I go.
I can’t work the characters out in
advance in my head. The people I
like to write about are what I call
pattern-making men, men unwilling to
live except on their own terms and
concerned with producing and making
sense out of things.”
For weeks, “Bring Larks and Heroes”
has been displayed impressively in
Angus and Robertson’s bookshop under
a sign declaring it to be the long-
awaited “Great Australian Novel.”
Its author, Thomas Keneally, is any-
thing but the Messianic figure these
well-worn words conjure up, yet there
is a certain urgency behind the smile
and the spectacles. Words and ideas
tumble after one another as if he’s
just made their acquaintance and is
afraid he won’t have enough time to
express them. But so far he seems
to have had a great deal of luck
with time. At 32, he’s at work on
his fifth novel, revising his fourth,
and between times writing a tele-
vision script for a dramatised
documentary.
He is working in the back-
yard study of his house in Syd-
ney’s north-western suburbs. Out-
side the sun is baking everything
into drowsy flatness, and there’s
that particular silence you feel
only on a suburban midday; in-
side Keneally is bubbling with
ideas yet to be written.
At the beginning of the year,,
he gave up his part-time teaching
job to take up his second Com-
monwealth Literary Fund grant
a 12-month one worth $6OOO
and began work on the new
novel, a story woven around an
epic Antarctic disaster. “The
main character is an old man,
who in the ’twenties became in-
volved in the tragedy and in
old age it becomes the focus of
all his failures.
“Then some member of a new
expedition finds the remains of a bit of
tent or a dog harness and realises the
body of a man is only yards away. When
this news gets back, it crystallises all
the old man’s horror and terrible ob-
sessive feelings about the situation. The
book has an entirely modern scene, so
it’s meant a change from the prophetic
style of ‘Larks and Heroes.’ ”
The success of that novel, set in a
penal colony in the South Pacific and
chronicling a man’s inevitable march
to the gallows, has catapulted Keneally
into the life of a full-time writer with
an impetus he shows signs of being able
to maintain. It is in its fifth Australian
printing, has been published in the
United Kingdom, will be published in
the United States later this year, and
paperback rights have also been sold.

“If this novel I’m working on now is
all right, we should be right for the next
two'or three years, even if I run dry.
And I think if I can keep going at the
rate of a novel a year we should be able
to live off my writing alone. Once you
get going, income comes in from all
sorts of unexpected sources.”
So do his story ideas, which can be
sparked off by a conversation, a piece of
history, or his own experience. A
Catholic, he spent six years training to
become a priest, but within six months
of being ordained he suffered a nervous
collapse and withdrew from religious
training.
“Three Cheers for the Paraclete,”
which he finished last August, and is
now revising, deals with a young priest’s
conflicts with church authority. “The
last of my bog-Irish novels,” he calls
it, and says it leaves the hero feeling
the same way as he himself does now
about Catholicism. “The old formulas
have just about had it, but there aren’t
any new ones to replace them.
“The clash between authority and
the rights of the individual bothers me
very much about the Catholic Church —
the business of where to draw the line.
But at the same time there is some
nascent connection with the truth there.
Superficially, there’s enmity between
Catholicism and humanism, but on a
profound level they echo one another
perfectly. There’s also a connection be-
tween mysticism and literature — and
these are some of the reasons why
Catholics stay kicking at the structure,
because there is some connection with
truth.”
But this, he says, is all polemics, and
polemics have no place in the novel.
. It must be about people and relation-
ships, as “Paraclete” (a name for the
Holy Spirit) is.
And in the end his survival as a
professional novelist will probably de-
pend on maintaining the deliberate
versatility he is displaying at present —
the ability to interest himself in some-
one, no matter how little this prospec-
tive character has in common with
Thomas Keneally.
These feelings have prompted his con-
cern with Harry (“The Breaker”)
Morant, the Australian horseman,
balladist, and “I suspect, philanderer of
some pretensions,” who was executed by
the British Government during the Boer
War.
He sees Morant’s extrovert nature as
a hard thing for “a neurotic novelist”
to depict, but is enthusiastic about the
challenge. This was the theme he ori-
ginally submitted to the Commonwealth
Literary Fund, but he has since post-
poned it in favor of his present novel,
because it will mean a trip to South
Africa for research, and the younger
of his two children is barely four
months old.
Keneally’s wealth of ideas is matched
by the case with which he seems to be
able to go from one to the next. Late
last year he started work on a novel
about a blind boy, wrote five chapters
and stopped, realising he would have to
“put it away to germinate for a while.”
This left him undismayed and ready
for his next subject.
“Childermas,” his second play, which
was staged as part of the Old Tote’s
program of Australian plays, is another
example of his adaptability, commis-
sioned as it was by the Australian Com-
mittee of Responsibility for the Chil-
dren of Vietnam.
“I am grateful for commissioned
work, but it’s certainly more difficult
to do because it’s not speaking for you
—not springing direct from you. I am
not personally impressed with mythical
themes, so it was hard for me to get
started on ‘Childermas,’ but I certainly
learned from it about writing plays.”
In writing a novel, Keneally has
found he cannot pre-plan very much
but must let his characters generate
their own actions, yet the uneasy terms
Thomas Keneally ... right for two
or three years
of the alliance between form and vitality
still worry him.
“Where do you draw the line?” he
says with one of his rare frowns. “When
a character generated by an incident
threatens to upset the unity of the
action, do you cut him down or let him
go? It’s the same with language. You
have impressive, arresting language at
one end—and it gets in the way of the
characters and the action. So do you do
straightforward prose? But C. P. Snow
and Kingsley Amis do that, and so often
it’s dull.
“With this novel I’m finding I can’t
use the language I did in ‘Larks and
Heroes,’ because it’s a modern setting.
In fact this time I’ve become quite
crabby with words—unwilling to ex-
periment. You know, I have a theory—
that this theme of the prophet, the Aus-
tralian prophetic landscape, is Something
that is being written out of our systems.
And when we come to write more head-
on with society, who knows, sales may
increase.”

Doubts among the ruins
By GEOFFREY FAIRBAIRN
WE ASSEMBLED outside the Viet-
namese National Press Centre just across
from the Continental Hotel where I
had a fine lunch with Denis Warner
and Peggy Durdin in October, 1954. It
must be the last hotel with character
left intact in South-East Asia. One’s
memory crowded its terrace once again
with pomaded French officers talking
arrogantly at the little pink-clothed
tables, still arrogant despite Dien Bien
Phu and the defeats in the Central
Highlands; one heard again the klaxon
and the motor-cycle escort preceding
General Paul Ely’s great black car, the
General slumped scowling in the back
like a Roman emperor pretending he
had not been overthrown.
But the Rue Catinat was now Tu-Do
Street and we were awaiting transport
to take us to Cholon to watch the
National Police and ARVNs (South
Vietnamese Army) flush out Viet Cong
snipers. Our Vietnamese Press guide’s
station wagon reached the kerb first. He
gallantly shepherded two young girl
correspondents into it; one of them wore
a parachutist’s badge on her black shirt,
won jumping with ARVN paras. But of
course Australians do not hear much
of the South Vietnamese paras; or their
Airborne troops who have taken heavy
casualties in Hue; let alone hear of the
Rangers who are out there in Khe Sanh
with the U.S. Marines. It appears to be
settled policy amongst Western corres-
pondents in Saigon to give as little
credit as is humanly possible to any
anti-Communist Vietnamese.
Such were the questions that came
most pertinently to my mind as I sensed
the growing impatience of the assembled
journalists and heard some of them
arguing that the fact the bus was late
was symptomatic of the whole South
Vietnamese effort. These men from the
suburbs of Western cities analysed this
war in terms of their own loss of
adrenalin.
A few of us decided to hire a car.
The driver would make around $lO out
of the morning’s run. I began to wonder
why he had not been called up: in the
villages young men uninvolved in some
kind of military or paramilitary service
are thin on the. ground, but Saigon
crawls with privileged young men on
Lambrettas. Whether this kind of graft
is morally more reprehensible than the
Viet Cong’s pressganging 13- and 14-
year-old boys to die terrified out in the
scrub seems doubtful -- thoughts as I
squeezed into the back seat between
John Bennetts, once of “Z Special,”
now of the “Age,” and Fred Nossal,
brother of the Director of the Walter
and Eliza Hall Institute, a reporter and
cameraman who had left Australia for
Canada. John Bennetts was wearing a
smart hat on the obviously sound
ground that since most Western jour-
nalists did such a splendid job for the
Communists, the more one looked civ-
ilianly journalist the better were one’s
chances of survival. Whenever possible
I complemented his dress with a safari
suiting that John believed would have
me taken for a French planter and
hence almost even more privileged in
Viet Cong eyes than a Western
journalist.
There were some bad traffic hold-ups
before we got to the barracks where
we were to pick up our armed escort.
This inconvenience evoked from Fred
an assertion about the absurdity of the
West talking progress to Asia at this
point of time. Delighted by this time
to exchange a bit of Western self-
laceration for incessant denigration of
the South Vietnamese, I kidded him
into elaborating on his theme. It really
amounted to the contention, which I
was not prepared to contest after listen-
ing to some Western journalists for a
day, that Western “progress” was now
quite devoid of moral content.
This was Bennetts’ cue to make me
tell them a story about a Viet Cong
leader who had died nobly on the tor-
ture table a couple of years back.
Western morale in the back seat was at
a low ebb by the time we reached the
barracks. It did not seem worth while
emphasising that in actual fact most
Viet Cong rank-and-file sang like de-
moralised gangsters as soon as they were
captured shopping their mates right,
left and centre in return for monetary
rewards. Neil Davis in front, a young
man with the face of a saint and one
of the steadiest visions of the struggle
I ever encountered, seemed proof
against dramatic disclosures; so, no
doubt, was the man beside him, Jimmy
Lee, a Korean hunting news stories who
occupied his time cursing everything
that was going on.
We pulled up under the barrel of a
tank in the barrack square and got out
for a briefing. A number of large Army
trucks laden with sacks of rice moved
out of the compound. Inevitably, a
correspondent said: “The ARVNs look
after themselves: they’ve got plenty of
rice.” Since the trucks were moving out
of the barracks, it seemed just possible
that this was a convoy distributing sup-
plies. But what was the point of argu-
ing? Most of these correspondents
wanted the Viet Cong to win, as a very
famous journalist argued a few days
later. This was not because of any
ideological sympathy for the Com-
munists; nor primarily out of contempt
for a society of which they were ignor-
ant; but, rather, because they were
possessed, probably all-unknowingly, by
a profound domestic sickness, the symp-
toms of which they preferred to find in
South Vietnam rather than in their
newspaper offices and in themselves.
These were thoughts while Fred took
some shots of the great military trucks
rumbling out of the square in a haze
of fine dust.
Headed by an armed jeep carrying
the major, who was our guide to the
Cholon mop-up, our convoy moved out
bound for Chinatown, a place where
poor people lived and rich Chinese
made money and most Chinese hated
the South Vietnamese officialdom
which, in the interests of nationalism,
had insisted on shop signs being phrased
in the Vietnamese language. Part of
Cholon had suffered most heavily dur-
ing the Tet offensive. Snipers were
reported still active. But when we de-
bouched from our cars near the An
Quang pagoda, on the edge of the
smoke-blackened ruins of a large city
block, there was no sound of firing.
Troops in camouflaged “tiger suits”'
carrying automatic weapons were
patrolling, but their walk betrayed none
of the intensity of men anticipating
shots from roofs and windows.
On the very edge of the ruins stalls-
were set up. A woman was slicing pork
on a block beside which bean shoots
w r ere stirring in an old enamel pot. An
old woman in black stuffed herself with
noodles from a cracked white-and-blue
bowl. Children played in the dirt.
Groups of people stood apathetically in
doorways, leaning against the drawn*
back steel shutters. A few yards past
them we were walking down a ruined
street of fire-gutted houses. In one of
the skeletal buildings a little shrine
stood high and brightly colored, mauve
joss-sticks clustered like the stems of
dead flowers in a jar beside it. A few
yards farther on a middle-aged man
stood with his family, all grinning
broadly in front of a white photograph
studio that had miraculously survived
the mortaring and the bombing. The
family were delighted survivors, most
scrutably proud of their good fortu .. •.
But their joy was a little premature: the
whole area was to be razed by bull-
dozers and the inhabitants moved to
various refugee centres. One day, per-
haps, they would return to an unrecog-
nisable block of apartment houses. Such
was the Government’s intention. Inevit-
ably, journalists began to suggest that
the locals should not be moved from
the area against their will. A young
girl correspondent said angrily: “Why
should American boys die for this
damned Government!” I said that even
at home after bushfires houses were not
immediately run up for the victims.
We walked amongst the buildings
off the street. Vietnamese reporters-
joked with locals standing dust-coated
in the ruins of their homes. Westerners
asked questions through interpreters.
But they did not get replies unfavor-
able to the Government. And this not
because the people were fearful of
speaking up; the Westerners from
suburbs that had known no disasters


greater than faulty plumbing just
could not understand that people do
not react to calamities in this fashion
not unless the “contradictions” are
politically exploited. They feel
stunned and then, for quite a long
time, apathetic. There is something
elemental about such cataclysms, es-
pecially in Vietnam. I remembered
the words of Nguyen Kuyen: “Life is
endless disillusion. Success, failure,
gain, loss are not worth a jug of
wine. Good, evil, praise, blame all
die with a laugh. Leaning on my pil-
low by the screen, I dream of becoming
a butterfly. The autumn wind blows
cold, the leaves of the jacaranda
fall.”
A bed stands out starkly, twisted
iron in a heap of pink masonry, all
that survives of a home. A man sits
on a bright blue cane chair in an
alley between ruins eating a freshly
baked French-style loaf of bread. A
man walks past holding a vice. A boy
saws a block of wood quite point-
lessly, awkwardly, holding the clean
light wood in his hand as he saws.
Patriotic songs blare out from a loud-
speaker only to be followed by harsh
evacuation orders. A family squats
under the roof of its new home: a
parachute colored burnt orange and
white. Burnt trees. Pink and white
tiled floors without walls. A piling
up of tiles and corrugated iron. An
old couple stagger by carrying the
family chest. Flies rioting on piles of
rotting vegetables. Refuge trucks mov-
ing away full of tangled iron. Men
rolling battered 44-gallon drums across
brick piler where? Children play-
ing in the dust. What is the Vietna-
mese proverb? “When bulls and buf-
faloes battle, flies and mosquitoes die.”
Patriotic song again. “When one is
happy, mountains and rivers are
happy, too; when one is sad flutes and
guitars are also sad.” Thoughts, use-
less amidst ruins. The only thing lack-
ing amongst us Western snoopers is
compassion.
We went then to the An Quang
pagoda, where the denigration began
all over again. A skyraider had done
a beautiful job of precision bombing,
wiping out the Viet Cong HQ in the
pagoda’s backyard without damaging
this haunt of “militant Buddhists” as
these Viet Cong collaborators are
called in the West. But ah, someone
says, inevitably, the raid did not
really have that purpose at all; it
was designed to destroy the “anti-
Government” printing press. Yet there
was no doubt that this was a Viet
Cong HQ.
Inside the pagoda a seated monk
was beating a gong with a hammer.
Slow strokes, deep boomings. Eternal
recurrence being sounded out under a
painting of the Lord Buddha in bless-
ing posture as though in quiet mockery
of the modern sound and fury evoked
by men who saw history as a straight
line purposefully leading where?
I watched the blank face of the gong-
striker. “Therefore,” the Lord Buddha
said at the end, “Be a refuge unto
yourself . . . whosoever shall be a
light unto himself and a refuge unto
himself, so that he needs no external
refuge, but holds fast to the Truth
as his lamp, he among my brethren
shall reach the very height.” Was
that blank-faced ascetic reaching a
height or putting on an act? I simply
had no idea. “Hard, hard it is to
find a Buddha, in a thousand years.”
We ended up at a well-guarded and
well-fortified precinct police station,
where we were promised another brief-
ing before moving down a street to
watch sniper-firing. But then it was
decided that such a venture was too
dangerous. If I had been a Vietnamese
official, I would have arranged for us
to be exposed to an ambush. But why
would the Viet Cong knock off their
best Public Relations officers?
Instead we- were shown three VC
suspects squatting on the floor of one
of the police offices. Some idiot dashed
about seeking an interpreter so that he
could question the VCs. It was difficult
to imagine quite what a suspect in a
police station under interrogation was
likely to give to the Western Press in
the way of local color. He unwisely
asked a Vietnamese reporter to act as
interpreter. “Get someone else!” the
man spat back at him. There was no
fear in the voice; just a fierce protest
against turning something terrible into
yet another little bit of news story for
the consumption of people across the
seas who did not give a damn about
Vietnam. Both sides in Vietnam for
a moment seemed to me to be trapped
in a cage where they were watched like
creatures in a zoo.
“The fish caught on a hook cannot
free itself,
The bird trapped in its cage cannot
take flight . . .”
Everything that had been happening
in the way of suffering lately had long
since and again and again been
prefigured in the Vietnamese writings
of older times. But at least then they
did not have Western pressmen moving
around übiquitously making a mockery
of their agonies. They would have been
spared then the frivolity of Westerners
rubbing their damp suburban resent-
ments together and trying to see these
poor and foreign people through the
spluttering.? of the smoke-blurred light
created thereby.
Perhaps thoughts about a cultural
death-wish had been mere fevers amidst
ruins. But I knew that the battle of
Saigon would be betrayed as one in
which only one side was brave the
side of the men whose leaders were set
upon reducing the peasantry of Vietnam
to the position of State serfs in an un-
workable and cruel system. Were they
not all brave, those who had brought
death into the city and died gamely
from windows and rooftops, and those
who fought them from behind trees and
garbage cans, and died, too, many of
them equally gamely?
This was a land of heroes and has
long been one: “Dying heroically, the
soul recovers its glory, the body
wrapped in the skin of the hero’s
charger! This should be a man’s dream
always!” Even the Vietnamese saying
seemed inappropriate amongst the ruins
of people’s security,
It would be dishonest to pretend not
to have had grave doubts amongst the
ruins. But since there was no easy or
quick solution, it seemed perhaps more
appropriate to recall something of this
people, even amidst ruins, rather than
use their suffering as a backdrop for
resentments emanating from places far
from Vietnam. The smacking of lips
among suffering is an exceedingly dis-
agreeable thing.


The defiant swan song
In her “1913 The Defiant Swan Song” Virginia Cowles claims that
the year before the beginning of World War I marked the end of an era.
It was, she suggests, neither Victorian nor Edwardian, but it was brash
and defiant, turbulent, adventurous, and moody. The photographs in
“1913 The Defiant Swan Song,” published by Weidenfeld and Nicolson,
evoke the period, but in 1968 some of them seem somewhat mysterious.
How much do these pictures mean to you?
1. What dance was this?
2. Who are these children
of enlightened parents?
3. Who are these important gentlemen?
4. What princess is this?


5. Who is this chess player?
6. Where is this English-

Tasmania’s
tourist gamble
BY BRIAN HOAD
LAST MONTH the Caucus of the
Parliamentary Labor Party in Hobart
authorised Cabinet to negotiate terms
and conditions with Federal Hotels for
a casino to be built at Wrest Point
almost an assurance that Australia’s
first gambling palace will be function-
ing before the .end of the year. If
this had happened in a mainland city
you can imagine the fuss there would
have been. But it was “only Tas-
mania” and the majority of main-
landers still have in their minds a
quaintly anachronistic, if not inferior,
pigeonhole in which they place all
things Tasmanian.
Tasmania, naturally, resents such
patronising lack of interest and has
made considerable efforts to belie it.
It has preoccupied itself with industrial
growth and has done so in the face of
two inexorable and related factors: a
basic Australian policy of rapid popu-
lation growth supported by rapid in-
dustrialisation; and a consequent and
ever-increasing pull on the population
by the major cities, the centres of
both industry and commerce. Tas-
mania’s considerable achievements over
the past ten years have undeniably re-
sulted in a greater general prosperity
and yet no “major city” has been estab-
lished and, more importantly, the out-
flow of Tasmanians to other States
continues. The Government was once
wont to claim that it would double the
population and create a self-perpetuat-
ing economic entity; it does so no
longer. It was once wont to neglect its
tourist potential; it has now pinned
some high hopes on it. Casinos have
been suggested and dismissed in Hobart
before this; Wrest Point is being
warmly welcomed as “the breakthrough
Tasmanian tourism has been looking
for for years.”
Industrialisation, based on the attrac-
tion of cheap hydro-electric power, has
been the hope and preoccupation of
Tasmanian efforts. Between 1960 and
65 the encouraging sum of $lB9 million
was spent on new and expanding in-
dustrial developments. Since then, an-
nouncements of intended industrial ex-
pansions have reached unprecedented
heights and the future looked rosy
enough, until the rains failed to come.
Last October, after ten months with
the lowest rainfall on record, power cuts
in the order of 35 percent were made
on heavy industry.
The Ministry of Industrial Develop-
ment insists that the cuts are not as
serious as they may at first appear:
neither domestic nor light industrial
consumers have been affected; in heavy
industry, 10 percent of the cuts “have
been taken up in power economies
which have streamlined, and not hin-
dered, its functions”; while the remain-
ing 25 percent has been absorbed by
dropping “less profitable side activi-
ties.” Nonetheless, some expansion
schemes have had to be postponed
along with Government ambitions for
a steel industry to be founded on the
“800 million tons of iron ore” which
remain to be exploited at Savage River.
A vagary of climate has hit Tasmania
where it hurts the most. Its extraordin-
ary power program has been caught on
the hop. The first thermal station (at
Bell Bay) is not due to start up for an-
other three years, even though mixed
power development programs have been
under discussion since the mid-19505.
The first of the seven stations of the
$ 103-million Mersey-Forth scheme in
the north-west is not due on stream
until the same time. The $4OO-million
plan to exploit the State’s largest
and wettest hydro-electric potential
in the Gordon River area of the south-
west has not yet got off the ground.
By 1975 Tasmania plans to have
enough power stored up to cope with
a peak demand of 1,145,000 kilowatts
compared with the 849,150 kilowatts it
could supply today if the dams were
full. But will industry continue to grow
sufficiently to make use of this extra
power? Or will that mooted cable at
last be laid across Bass Strait and Tas-
mania be in the market as an exporter
of cheap electric power? (Even on the
more difficult and expensive projects
now being planned, the cost of hydro-
electric power is put at 0.38 cents com-
pared with 0.55 cents for thermal
stations.)
The present power shortage does not
appear to be the only factor in the
slowing down of industrial growth. As
far as its present population of 370,000
is concerned, Tasmania could well be
approaching industrial saturation. The
State’s unemployment figures have come
steadily down to only 0.2 percent above
the Commonwealth average, and most

The gaming tables may be crowded at Wrest Point before the end of this year
of these are women. Industry is be-
ginning to feel the pinch of staffing
difficulties. The Government is at last
facing up to the inevitable dilemma: it
makes special efforts through selective
forms of immigrant hunting to satisfy
the most urgent staffing needs of the
industries it has already attracted; at
the same time, it persists with its search
for “sources of increased employment to
offset the present drift of adult Tas-
manians to the other States,” while the
population growth stagnates and the
lights of the “major cities” of the
mainland remain as seductive as ever.
But even if industrialisation is slow-
ing down temporarily or not if
dreams of steel industries have had to
be shelved and the future of hydro-
electric power is lost in a series of
question marks, the tourist potential
remains, and there is now more time
and more incentive to tackle it. There
is certainly more need.
The steady increase in the number
of tourists from 170,000 in 1962-63 to
230,000 last year was achieved without
particular effort on the part of the
authorities. Indeed, despite the Govern-
ment’s claim that it spends more (per
capita) on tourist advertising than any
other State, the $95,000 spent last year
(Queensland spent $140,000) seems
pretty meagre, particularly in the
shadow of the vast public expenditures
which the attempts to realise industrial
growth ambitions have involved. Com-
petition from Queensland and New
Zealand is hotting up, and if Tasmania
is to achieve its hopeful estimate of
400,000 visitors spending $4O million
by 1974, some very good ideas must
be thought up to give the present
growth-rate a hearty boost.
One such good idea could well be
Federal Hotels’ proposals for an $8 mil-
lion redevelopment of the site
at Wrest Point, close to Hobart, to pro-
vide a 350-bed hotel, a “world stan-
dard” convention centre —“which could
be used for concerts and plays,” says
Federal’s chairman, Mr. C. A. Edwards,
almost apologetically and a casino,
housing 12 tables for roulette, chemin
de fer, and “21.”
During Hobart’s three summer
months there is a real need for extra
hotel accommodation which has never
been satisfied due to the economic diffi-
culties involved in weathering the
other nine. The casino is planned to
overcome such difficulties as far as the
350 new beds are concerned. It could
also considerably extend, if not per-
petuate, Hobart’s “season.” Worth con-
sidering, too, are the pleasure cruises
which call in for a tantalising few
hours, or, even worse, silently pass by
in the night. Inquiries among U.S.
travel agents have met with assurances
that, should the casino materialise, stays
of anything up to four days are to be
expected and there is little doubt
Australians (who spend $730 million
a year on gambling, $325 million of
it illegally) will find the new attraction
equally irresistible. Such a potentially
profitable demand can hardly go beg-
ging much longer, for, although Queens-
land and New Zealand seem unlikely
to offer satisfaction, Noumea has been
threatening to install authentic French
pleasures in a similar vein for some
time, and in this particular race the
winner will almost inevitably scoop
the pool.
Government reaction to the proposals
has been one of discreet enthusiasm,
even among the more puritanical ele-
ments, and it seems pretty well assured
that when the necessary legislation is
put to a free vote in the House of
Assembly, sometime in April, a sub-
stantial majority will be achieved.
Neither should the Legislative Council
prove to be a stumbling block, for
although its members are not enthusi-
astic, neither are they opposed in prin-
ciple, and, like true Independents, are
holding an open-minded silence until
full details of the proposals have been
decided.
Indeed, the most surprising element
in the whole affair has been the lack
of organised opposition. There have,
of course, been lone Cassandras
prophesying doom and depravity; there
have also been more banal complaints
about the “desirability” of the type of
visitor that will be attracted. The Tas-
manian Council of Churches has, for
its part, started organising an investi-

gation into the “moral and social con-
sequences” of the proposals in the belief
that “if the Government was convinced
that the casino was in the best interests
of the community it should proceed to
legislation with as much knowledge and
information as could be obtained.”
Singlemindedness in the pursuit of
communal interests would seem to be
at least one advantage drawn from the
small size and patronised status of this
State, which tends to realise it simply
cannot afford the sanctimonious
pleasures of the more-than-often-
hypercritical attitudes struck by north-
ern neighbors whenever ideas of casinos
have been mooted in their own parishes.
And there is no reason why it should,
provided it avoids the pitfalls of lax
licensing and inadequate supervision
into which the Governments of Britain
and Nevada have fallen. In Britain,
since the Betting and Gaming Act,
1960, something in excess of 800 casinos
have mushroomed, together with vice
and racketeering. On the other hand,
in the numerous other Government-
controlled and often Government-owned
casinos of Europe, adequate policing,
more than financed by goodly slices of
casino profits, have preserved “clean”
establishments, despite the presence of
highly sophisticated underworlds.
What the Government in Hobart
must now sort out in precise detail
is just what forms of control it is
going to impose. Should it, perhaps,
own the place outright; should the
odds of the games be so adjusted that
profits are made on admission fees
alone; should the police be given right
of free access; what restrictions, if any,
should be placed on its use by Tas-
manians; just what are “the most
sophisticated security systems available”
which have been promised? The
Government must also decide what
sized slice of the cake it is going to
require. Both a licensing fee and a
percentage of the profits are considered
the most likely, and if Federal Hotels
does not find this too demanding the
casino, at least, should be functioning
within six months of the go-ahead.
With opinion successfully tested, the
basic decision made, accusations of
moral torpidity already weathered, and
Noumea looming threateningly on the
horizon, there should be few hold-ups.
From the economic point of view it
would be best to have the lights
twinkling and the wheels spinning by
the start of the “season” next Decem-
ber. And even if it does lead the
occasional “unlucky” soul to miserably
seek cold comfort in the waters of the
Derwent as one critic in Hobart
foresees that it will some little con-
solation may be gained by considering
the crueller facts of protection rackets,
gang feuds, and violent deaths that
have proliferated for years among
the übiquitous and illegal baccarat clubs
of Sydney.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Money in the wrong place
THERE are more to come. The $25
million AMP Society redevelopment
scheme for “Shopping City” between
Sydney’s Pitt, Market, and Castlereagh
Streets (doubling the cost and beating
the height of Australia Square) is soon
to be followed by others. Apart from
the Japanese suggestions about the
Hotel Sydney site, and the Bucking-
hams’ $7 million scheme already under
way in Oxford Street, there is likely to
be a major AMP project at the north
end of Phillip Street taking in the
whole block behind its existing Circular
Quay headquarters. And the Australian
Gas Light Company is rumored to be
keen to redevelop its site near Central
Railway Station, and so to centralise
all the office staff it has.
There is no doubt the schemes are
necessary; the nation needs efficient
cities, and the AMP Society’s plan,
with its attempts to get pedestrians off
the roads, is one way of increasing
efficiency. But there is a major objec-
tion to the whole project; this is in the
use of local money to finance it. At a
time when foreign investors are having
to provide the basic finance to pay for
so many of Australia’s mineral develop-
ments, Australian money is being
poured into city real estate. Australian
life assurance offices alone spend a
fortune on buying real estate (last year
they poured in an extra $5l million),
while foreign investors have been called
on to put something like $57 million a
year into Australian mining develop-
ments quite apart from the $37 mil-
lion they invested in the search for oil
last year.
And with this money goes control.
So while Australian institutional in-
vestors maintain their solid control over
the developments of the cities, foreign
investors are busy controlling the
majority of our basic developmental
projects. There can be no doubt about
the scope for conflicts between the
national interests of countries like Aus-
tralia and the corporate interests of
international mining groups.
It is true that some life offices, the
AMP in particular, are spending large
sums as members of consortiums supply-
ing the finance for projects like the
predominantly Australian Mt. Newman
iron-ore scheme, for which the AMP
is to put up $ll million. And it is
true that some Australian real-estate
developers, like the Dutch-oriented
Lend Lease Corporation, have been
using more overseas than local fixed
interest funds in their major city pro-
jects. The strategy for Australia should
clearly be more of this kind of financ-
ing: getting money from abroad to pay
for things like real-estate development
where control does not matter, and
using local cash for investment in those
areas, like mining developments, where
it is vital to have control over future
policy firmly in Australian hands.
But there has been no official or
unofficial recognition of this need;*
“shortage of capital” as an excuse for
not proceeding with developmental
projects sounds absurd in the present
context of the multi-million dollar pro-
jects now under way or planned for
Sydney and Melbourne and financed
by Australian cash.
But is it the life assurance com-
panies fault? Each must get the high-
est rates of return available on their
money in order to compete with other
life offices with bonus rates in order
to get customers; and this pressure is
particularly acute in a situation where-
they are required by law to put 30
percent of their funds into low-yielding
Government securities.
It is the Government that has got its
priorities wrong; there should be major
taxation incentives for the life offices
to invest in national development and
massive disincentives for them to in-
vest in real estate; and vice versa for
foreign investors. But as things stand,
only a tiny fraction of the $340 million
that was added to life assurance com-
pany assets last year found its way into
national development, while $154 mil-
lion ended up in Government securities,
$5l million in the stockmarket in ordin-
ary shares, another $5l in property —
and, homeseekers please note, only $8
million in extra loans to homebuilders.
For the AMP Society itself, this year’s
investment will total about $2OO mil-
lion, and about one quarter of this
will probably go into real estate and
shares, with the sum it has to spend
each year growing at greater than 10
percent. What a contribution this sort
of cash could make to our rate of
national development!
Government spending
Pronounced inflationary tendencies?
TO SAY THAT Taxable Capacity is
limited is not to say there is anything
fixed about it. Indeed, when the
National Product is expanding so also
will Taxable Capacity. That is obvious
enough from the fact that every year
the harvest from taxation gets bigger
and bigger in Australia without putting
unbearable strains on the private sector
of the economy. Even though the tax
slug may be considered to be high here,
in fact, when the element of taxation
revenue applied to public works expen-
diture is taken out, we are among the
lowest taxed countries.
Compared with Britain, for instance,
we come out most favorable, especially
after the increases in its Budget last
week. We complain, yes, as is our
prerogative, and any resistance put up,
say, by way of pressures for higher
wages, can be detrimental to the
economy. The acid test, however, of
whether taxation has been pushed
above Taxable Capacity is whether it
is on its own account pushing up prices.
If this effect is not difficult to detect in
the case of higher charges for public
utilities, it is certainly very difficult to
measure over the whole field of taxa-
tion. Rule-of-thumb notions like the
one that taxation is inflationary when
it exceeds 25 percent of National Pro-
duct—as expounded once by Mr. Colin
Clark—was presumed to have been de-
bunked a long time ago.
It is unrealistic to abstract the ele-
ment of Government spending applied
to public works from the discussion and
the Institute for Public Affairs has done
a service in recasting the international
comparisons on the basis of its inclu-
sion. It points out that 32 percent
of our Government spending is applied
to capital works compared with 20 per-
cent of Britain’s. Further, public works
and defence combined account for 45
percent of the total Government spend-
ing here, a much higher proportion than
Britain’s 35 percent, Canada’s 30 per-
cent, France’s 29 percent, and West
Germany’s 28 percent. Looking
around at the complaints and the pres-
sures for higher wages as well as at the
inflationary signals, the IPA comes to
the conclusion that: “Government
claims on resources are already in seri-
ous conflict with private claims (for
both capital and consumption), giving
rise to pronounced inflationary tenden-
cies in the Economy.” With defence
bound to take more and industrial
pressures rampant, the Institute thinks
it would be foolish and wrongheaded
to aggravate the situation by failing to
reduce Government spending.


MEN AND MATTERS
For the economy: Australia’s international reserves
were $llO2 million at the end of February, their lowest
level for some seven years . . . Industrial production is con-
tinuing to expand, but the drought is restraining some sectors
. . . Mr. McEwen expressed concern at the rising threat
posed by Japanese imports to the local auto industry.
For the markets: It was a momentous week . . .
Australian share markets were very nervous at the beginning
of the week that the British Budget would act to restrain
overseas portfolio investment, but the voluntary system was
retained and the market gained new life.
Seven Western central bankers decided in Washington on
a two-tier system of gold prices . . . On Wall Street, stock
prices were generally uncertain, only rallying on rumor that
Switzerland might act as mediator in Vietnam peace talks
. . . Government bonds gained in London after the cut in
bank rate from 8 to 1\ percent . . . The London gold
market is closed for two weeks.
For companies : The Dutch Philips group is to acquire
about one-third of Electronic Industries’ voting B shares for
$1.50 each, taking 1.5 million new shares and offering to
buy 1.5 million shares from existing shareholders . . . Later
in the week, Electronic made an offer for the shares in A
and I Discounters which it doesn’t already hold . . . lAC
bids 20c a share for all Bebarfalds’ capital except for one
share per shareholder to give the bidder the benefit of
substantial tax losses . . . The struggle for O’Connell Cor-
poration continued with Commercial Guaranty seeking to
cancel the allotment of shares to Mainline.
Commodore Motels plans to link with Dillingham Cor-
poration in a $5 million venture to redevelop Cliveden
Mansions.
Latec will be out of receivership by the end of this month
after full repayment of first-mortgage debentures.
Ampol will make a $6 million cash and conversion deben-
ture issue to the Ampol “family” . . . BHP’s $4O million
debenture issue was heavily oversubscribed.
Output of coke, iron, and steel by BHP rose in the nine
months to February ... a decision is close on CRA’s plan
to establish an aluminium smelter in N.Z., and a go-ahead
on the Bougainville copper prospect. The Anaconda-CRA
nickel prospect at Widgiemooltha has disappointed so far. . .
New BH has at least 33 years’ ore at current milling rates
... A Westfield subsidiary has $8 million worth of contracts
to build ore-handling facilities for Mt. Newman in the West.
At the halfway mark, Mayne Nickless reported better
results, W. R. Carpenter profit up 13 percent, Travelodge
Aust. earning higher profits after substantially higher tax,
Dickson Primer raising the interim from 4 to 4| percent,
Thiess’ dividend up from 5 to 6J percent, although profits
only up slight, Fairfax profit and turnover higher, Linde-
man’s results very satisfactory.
For the year to December, Borg Warner swung from a.
loss of $514,000 to a profit of $700,000, and returned to the
dividend list with a payment of six percent . . . J. C. Ludowici.
lifted ordinary dividend from 13-| percent to 15 percent . . .
Email had a record profit, lifting dividend from nine to 11
percent from earning rate to 17.4 percent . . . APCM’s
profit was steady.
The Ford Motor Co. of Australia multiplied profit ten
times to $9.7 million, but pays no dividend to its American
parent. Sales leapt by $44.6 million to a record $208.8 mil-
lion, increasing its share of the total industry vehicle volume
from 18.1 percent to 20.2 percent. This rise was mostly at
the expense of General Motors-Holden’s, whose share of the
Australian car market declined in 1967 from 30.3 percent
to 28.2 percent; group net profit for the same period fell
from $22,619,000 to $20,286,000, the values of sales declined
by $20.4 million to $325.6 million, and dividend was cut from
$l4 million to $l3 million.
MEN AND MATTERS
FOR OVERSEAS destroyers of Aus-
tralian exchange listed names
lately the palm surely goes to the
gregarious Britain-based group, Slater
Walker, who last week looked certain
to succeed in its bid for the Melbourne
firm, Plastalon Ltd. While still a pro-
prietary last year, Slater Walker got
hold of 82 percent of the shares of
Bramac Ltd. when it took over Green-
gate and Irwell Rubber. It then suc-
cessfully bid for the rest of them, and
Bramac was gone from the lists.
Another move was to eat one of its
Australian young, Tunleys, a pro-
prietary which held a majority of
shares in Wancol Holdings Ltd. There-
upon it changed the latter’s name to
Slater Walker Securities (Aust.) Ltd.,
and Wancol, like Bramac, left us.
In gobbling up Plastalon a third
familiar name will go. But this is not
to say its trade name is going to dis-
appear as well. Like Bramac’s it will
be preserved, though the group’s plan
for dovetailing the activities of the two
concerns which have similar activities
haven’t yet been crystallised.
, Anyway, the present chairman and
managing director of Plastalon, erst-
while Dutchman John Kreveld, now in
his early sixties, who founded the busi-
ness in a converted Camberwell stable
after the war, is not going to depart
the scene. Plastalon has been a life
success story (not without its ups and
downs) for Kreveld who was born and
educated as a banker in Holland. He
came to Australia to take his chance
in business here after working for an
import-export group in the Dutch East
Indies and as a result of meeting up
with Australians as a Japanese POW on
the Burma-Siam railway. Both he and
his wife are long-time naturalised Aus-
tralians and his son Philip, an elec-
tronics engineering graduate of Mel-
bourne University, is the Australian
manager of an American computer
company.
TWO “retired from active service”
Tiger Moth aircraft in the early post-
war days were the beginnings of the
company that last month joined the
Stock Exchange lists as Rex Aviation
Holdings Ltd. They were owned by
the late Eliot King and his son, Miles,
now the 43-year-old chairman and
managing director of Rex, and were
used in an aerial agriculture venture in
New Zealand. After seven years, the
Kings’ company, Rural Aviation, had
switched from its Moths, and the two
Beavers it subsequently bought, into
ten Cessnas (it now has 28 in its fleet).
John Kreveld
Miles King
Now Miles King’s Rex Aviation groups
has the Cessna franchise in New Zea-
land, Australia, and the Pacific Islands,,
runs flying schools, and operates charter
services. Next month it begins a mas-
sive “learn to fly” promotion scheme
through BP service stations, which
will hand out two million coupons, en-
titling the holder to a $l2 lesson for $5
at any Cessna flying school.
Rex has come a long way since Miles,
an ex-RNZAF war-time pilot, took over
the chair when his father, a World War
I ace, died in 1958. Miles, who had
been “flying mad” since childhood,,
piloted the first crop duster the com-
pany had; these days his flying is-
limited to getting himself around Rex’s
extensive Australian operations.

Less protection
needed for
local crude
BY J. C. HORSFALL
NO LONGER DO Australian oil
searchers huddle around dry holes like
hungry men. Their conferences these
days are held at the Southern Cross
Hotel, as the one last week after the
news that, even with local consumption
rising at 8 to 9 percent a year, in a
couple of years they will be meeting
upward of three-fifths of Australia’s
crude-oil requirements from their wells
and enough natural gas to satisfy the
nation’s needs for the foreseeable
future.
At this eighth annual conference of
the Australian Petroleum Explorations
Association there was a sort of un-
official proclamation of Australia’s entry
into the top league of world oil
provinces.
Those who feel that some of the gilt
is shed by the fact that the lion’s share
of the effort lies with the international
oil companies and the capital they’ve
applied were given a soporific by Mr.
C. A. Byrne, chairman of the Austra-
lian Mining Council and a director of
CRA, itself 85 percent overseas-owned.
He pointed out that BHP, now the
truest of blue Australian-owned com-
panies, was 74 percent owned by over-
seas interests in 1911. The inference to
be drawn from that wasn’t quite clear,
either for the successful oil search com-
panies or, say, for CRA itself. We can
but keep hoping and, anyway, thanks
to BHP, we do have a big fist in re-
serves proven thus far, and have the
good prospect of it being at least main-
tained from new finds in Bass Strait
through BHP’s 50-50 partnership with
Esso in that area. For the rest, our
share is pretty small, 20 percent interest
in net profit from the Moonie field
through Australian Oil and Gas, and
one-seventh share of WAPET (which
owns the Barrow Island field) through
Ampol Exploration.
An interesting situation is arising on
the likely level of protection, now 75
cents a barrel, for indigenous oil pro-
duction here. In the view of Mr. R. C.
Sprigg, the Adelaide oil search con-
sultant who addressed the conference,
the present level which is the Fed-
eral Government’s idea of what the
protection should be rather than the
Tariff Board’s, who advised a much
lower figure must surely be reduced
when time comes for its revision next
year. Oil search groups who as yet
have no production on tap will hardly
agree. The position of refinery com-
panies is mixed. Presumably those with
no crude production here will press
strongly for a reduction, companies like
BP, for instance, which has complained
harder than anybody at the high cost of
its share of local crude it has to buy.
So will Mobil and Amoco.
In the case of Esso, which has a
refinery in South Australia, an attempt
might be made to reinforce its com-
petitive position in distribution by keep-
ing the present level of protection.
When Bass Strait oil comes into pro-
duction it will presumably be getting
its crude at cost price. Shell, Caltex,
Boral (with Total), and Ampol will
be in an intermediate position, because
all four have stakes in WAPET crude.
However, on present indications they
would have to take a large part of their
requirements from BHP-Esso.
The position is the more complicated
by the present unsatisfactory state of oil
search in the mainland. Activity there
fell away lamentably last year, not
only in drilling but also seismic and
other geophysical work performed, as
well as in terms of oil and gas funds.
Most of the drilling was in fact produc-
tion drilling in the Windarra formation
on Barrow Island by WAPET when
160 or so holes were drilled. It is
symptomatic of the dismal state of
drilling on the mainland that 25 rigs
out of the 35 available were idle for
most of the year. This suggests that at
least the smaller oil-search groups find
little incentive even in the present crude
oil protection. Most are content to do
just enough to keep their tenancies alive
some are not even doing as much
as that.
Mr. L. W. Williams, a Bureau of
Mineral Resources officer, told the con-
ference that a number of tenaments
(both on and offshore) would become
available for reallocation this year. Of
course, on this showing it could be
argued that the level of protection is
not high enough, but all along one has
taken the view that its effect on search
incentive would be minimal and that a
more enlightened subsidy policy would
be a better alternative.
It is an open question how a lowering
of protection would affect offshore
exploration, which is, of course, very
much more costly than land search.
This is a game for the strong only. Its
participants will account for most of
the $65 million (give or take a few
million) which, according to the Bureau
of Mineral Resources, will be spent on
oil search in Australia this year (bring-
ing the total spent on it so far up to
about $550 million). This year up to
eight offshore drilling rigs will be in
action at various times around the Aus-
tralian coasts. Admittedly, some of last
year’s offshore rigs used here will be
retreating to foreign waters after getting


CROESUS
negative results, like Shell’s Sedco rig
in the so far unyielding Otway basin —
but newcomers are expected, such as
one by WAPET to drill in the Barrow
Island region. All in all, the promise of
the offshore prospects, rather than the
present inflated price for Australian
crude, would seem to be the determin-
ing factor behind the continuing high
interest shown by international oil
groups in our offshore search.
Only about 10 percent of our cur-
rent crude usage (7.9 percent for 1967
as a whole) is bearing the inflated
cost caused by the high present pro-
tection for local crude. The rest is
bought overseas at world prices. As
the proportion of local crude to total
usage rises, so, given existing protec-
tion, will the prices of petroleum pro-
ducts from Australian refineries, which
f° r some years have supplied nearly all
Australian demand,
The prospect of two-fifths of our
crude usage coming from local wells
in the next few years in fact demands
a big reduction in the level of protec-
tion on the grounds that otherwise the
cost of transport over the whole eco-
nomy would rise appreciably. Some-
thing the economy simply cannot
afford. Transport costs are too high
in this country as it is, though other
factors than the prices of petroleum
products (which are low here by world
standards, largely because taxes on
them are relatively low) contribute
strongly to this.
Book review
An infectious “English” disease
By J. C. HORSFALL
Foreign Exchange Crises an Essay
in Economic Pathology. Paul Einzig.
Macmillan. $5.65.
OTrvDT r UAV U 1 J L i .
PEOPLE MAY BE shocked when their
currencies are suddenly devalued, but
Paul Einzig, who probably knows more
about foreign exchange crises than any-
body 3.livc 5 contends they seldom do
much to ensure the strength of their
currencies, put most of the blame on
wicked foreigners when devaluation
comes, and do little to help their local
Canute to stave off that evil day.
T J
In this book he delivers a stern mes-
sage to Britain that foreign exchange
crises will continue unless there is a
national regeneration” to strengthen
the economy. He attributes Britain s
chronic weakness since the war largely
to wages outrunning productivity gains.
This is colloquially known as the Eng-
lish disease, which I must say is pretty
infectious, as Germany has now got it
and we ve had it for ages.
While that reasoning may be true
enough (one can think of other soft
spots in Britain’s position), he leaves
unanswered the big question of how to
stop the rot. He wants shock treatment
to be applied by the Government, and
is not convinced that the present one
is really prepared to give it. The book
appears to have been ruled off before
the devaluation in November last, and
he doesn t give an opinion as to whether
devaluation was inevitable or would, in
fact, do the trick on the scale adopted.
The United States also comes in for
criticism on sirhilar lines, but in its
case the devils of the piece are named
as over-expansion and failure to put the
balance of payments on a more even
keel to stop the go. Since the book was
written, the U.S. has taken drastic
action to cut back its balance-of-pay-
ments deficit. Presumably its action
would satisfy Einzig, though even as I
write new pressures are again building
up against the dollar. In any case, Ein-
zig is against increasing the price of
gold, which would be, he says, an invi-
tation for resurgence of inflation every-
where when de fl a tion is called for,
especially in the two reserve currency
countries

dollar and sterling. In the author s
view something more than a milk-and-
water i ncomes po licy is required in
Britain. Einzig’s basic aim in approach-
ing deflation would seem to be namely
t o create more unemployment with the
ob j ect of implying industrial disci-
pline, which has gone t 0 pot not only
in Britain and the US> but also in
Australia. Einzig wouldn’t find many
supporters for putting the unemploy-
ment clock back to the bad old days,
but at least he supports his plea for
deflation as a cure for foreign exchange
crises with some convincing arguments,
The alternative of encouraging uni-
versal “degeneration” and sloppy eco-
nomic attitudes generally is not in his
book.
He po i n t s to countries such as Italy
and J aparlj which have learned to take
their industrial disciplinary medicine
and to to i erat e something less than
over-full employment in the interest of
currency stability. Of course, if de-
generation was universal, the structure
of foreign exchange rates around the
world would not be disrupted by this or
that country toughening up its economy,
Maybe when after the war leading
international economists were advocat-
ing universal full employment they had
this in mind. The main point about it
is that all countries must keep in
inflationary step. But in the past 20
years there’s been rather too much
over-full employment in some places
and not enough employment in others,
and international liquidity-creating de-
vices have failed to even things out for
the more degenerate whose sins have
been found out in the balance of pay-
ments.
While we await improvement in
liquidity-creating devices to sustain bal-
ance-of-payment deficits of countries
whose currencies are on the hot seat,
more trouble looks in store on the
foreign exchange markets. Apropos of
this, what about the 10,000 million or
so refugee dollars now floating around
Euro-currency circles from which Alco
has just cornered $4l million? Einzig
gives only a short glimpse of the possi-
bilities for international liquidity from
this source and although he says some
interesting things about the way some of
the money has been used to support
bear operations against sterling (in par-
ticular), on the whole he merely whets
the appetite for more on the subject.
There’s rather too much humdrum
stuff in this book, which in parts is
directed to those with a technical know-
ledge of foreign exchanges and in part
to the general reader who can hardly
be acquainted with the technical intri-
cacies. So the balance is a bit awry.
By far the most impressive sections for
the expert are Einzig’s accounts of the
play on the forward foreign exchange
markets and other usefulness of outward
arbitrage during the 1964-67 sterling
crises: in effect, dealings in forward
exchange by the Bank of England and
its outside arbitrage operations (with
very little cost), the amount of inter-
national liquidity which was brought to
the support of sterling. (He suggests it
was probably more than the whole of
the IMF and short-term credits
obtained.) Although as a student of
foreign exchange Einzig shows himself
fascinated by these dealings, he has no
doubt that even if they enable Britain
to ride out the pressures against sterling
for much longer than it could otherwise
have done they also had the effect of
giving a false impression of the actual
strength of reserves, so blinding the
British public to the real extent of the
balance of payments deficit and thus
allowing the Government to delay
enforcement of the necessary economic
retrenchment.
Despite this, Einzig has selected
further use of the forward exchange
market for his suggestion of a novel
way to galvanise sterling (or, indeed,
any other currency of a country possess-
ing sizable overseas assets in a foreign
exchange crises). This is to get (in the
case of a sterling crises) all British
residents holding overseas securities and
other assets abroad to buy sterling for-
ward as a counter to those who would
be selling it short on the forward
exchange. This, it is claimed, would not
only act as a solid backstop (without
realising such assets and costing very
little), but by reducing the discount on
forward sterling it would also increase
proceeds from outward arbitrage.

A NEW DEAL FOR
MAN AND HIS SOIL
..a simple fact, called The Law of the Minimum,’
holds the key to rural prosperity.
Rural development in Australia has only
touched the fringes of a vast and exciting
potential. But with our small popula-
tion, development is inevitably retarded.
Headworks for water conservation are
delayed. With vast distances to span, the
construction of roads and railways cost
more per head of population than any
country in the world.
It is a vicious circle. Development needs
money; money stems from people ready
to foot the bill—and Australia is the
world’s most underpopulated continent.
An immediate answer to the problem
lies in stepping up rural prosperity and
obtaining higher returns for investment
at both farm and national level; in real-
ising on the full potential of the land al-
ready in use.
Fortunately, because of the growing
awareness of the problem, men are now
looking critically at their land. Is it
working to capacity or merely at “half-
pressure?”
To double agricultural output without
appreciably raising farm costs would
dramatically raise community prosper-
ity. Productivity gains of this order are
becoming an increasing reality in our
agriculture.
‘Bonus’ output—increased yield without
increased acreage, or overhead—can be
achieved over a great range of produc-
tion by the application of one simple
fact of plant nutrition.
This fact is called ‘The Law of the
Minimum’ and states—‘The growth of
all plants is limited by the most defi-
cient plant nutrient element present in
the soil, all others being present in ade-
quate amounts.’ The plant will only
progress to the maximum ‘ceiling’ set
by the element in short supply.
FERTILIZERS:
KEY TO FARM
PROSPERITY
If the balance of soil nutrients is cor-
rected by supplementing those in short
supply, full advantage is taken of all
nutrient elements and yields are drama-
tically increased. All resources, water,
land, labour and capital investment are
then used to their maximum advantage.
This process of correction is best under-
taken by the application of chemical
fertilizers containing the nutrient ele-
ments vital to plant growth. The most
important are nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium and sulphur because these
are required in large amounts. Second-
ary and trace elements, notably calcium,
magnesium* molybdenum, zinc, boron,
are also necessary.
Today, Greenleaf is manufacturing fer-
tilizers containing these elements in the
varying proportions required for the
balanced nutrition of our crops and pas-
tures.

The letter of
the law on lost
share scrips
MOST COMPANIES in Australia are
pretty easy going on the subject of
lost share scrips. All they usually
require, before coming good with a new
certificate, is a letter saying that the
scrip can’t be found but if it is it’ll be
shot straight into the company. How-
ever, I heard the story the other day
of one company that w'as a bit harder
than usual to get along with. They
insisted on the letter of the law being
followed right down to the dots on the
i’s and the crosses on the t’s. Here’s
what they made a shareholder do.
Firstly, he had to provide a statutory
declaration to the effect that his cer-
tificate was, in fact, lost and that he
would undertake to return it to the
company if and when it re-appeared.
Fair enough. The next thing that hap-
pened was that he received a bill in
the mail for $8.75 for a newspaper
ad. This, the company secretary most
righteously pointed out when queried,
w r as to comply with the bit in the Com-
panies Act where it says an applicant
for a fresh share scrip may be required
“to cause an advertisement to be in-
serted in a daily newspaper in a place
specified by the directors stating that
the certificate or document has been
lost or destroyed, and that the owner
intends after the expiration of 14 days
after the publication of the advertise-
ment to apply to the company for a
duplicate.” Not content with stopping
there, the company then hit our man
with another bill. This time it was $5
for an indemnity bond to cover the
risk of his $lOOO worth of scrip sud-
denly re-appearing and being sold.
Again the company secretary claimed he
was within the law. He was. The act
plainly says that any applicant for a
re-issue of scrip can be asked to “fur-
nish a bond for an amount equal to at
least the current market value of the
shares indemnifying the company
against loss following a production of
the original certificate.” The final out-
come of the deal was that the share-
holder ended up paying the $13.75
necessary to get his new certificate.
Immediately on receipt of the scrip
he sold the shares so he’d “never be
faced with the same problem again.”
There’s probably a moral somewhere
in the story, but it varies depending on
whether you’re a finicky secretary or
an irate shareholder as to just what it
is.
On the subject of problems, a com-
pany that has had its fair share of these
is L. J. Hooker Investment Corporation
Ltd. Since its thumping loss of $636,000
back in 1962, the company has had a
rugged though reasonably successful
struggle back to recovery. It now looks
as though it’s getting somewhere. Last
year it earned $1.2 million and this year
looks like doing better. In fact, this
year looks like seeing the company back
on the dividend lists for the first time
since 1961. Directors have already ad-
mitted that this is a possibility and the
general guess around town is that a
final dividend somewhere around the
four percent mark will be paid. Profit
for the half year bears this out. It was
up 41 percent on 1967 and, at $755,000,
it showed a return (on an annual basis)
of almost 14 percent on issued capital.
All divisions of the group, with the ex-
ception of the pastoral side which is
having drought problems, were reported
as trading profitably. Even the pastoral
loss wasn’t too bad. It was only $49,000.
This was because of improved results
from the company’s two main proper-
ties in the Northern Territory. However,
the pastoral side may not get off so
lightly in the second half of the year.
The loss of the company’s New South
Wales wheat crop is expected to cause
a “considerable loss.” However, overall,
the company looks well poised for a
really good year in 1967-68, particularly
in its land project development division
which is sufficiently large to offset any
worries in the pastoral division. At
57 cents the shares look good.
Another company which also looks
good, unbelievably good, at today’s
price is BHP. The market doesn’t seem
to care that the company has announ-
ced revised oil production from its
Gippsland offshore wells to the extent
of $5O million a year. It’s pricing the
stock at around the same levels it was
before the revision. The company now
has a half interest in 240,000 barrels of
oil a day (previously it was only
105,000), which means a revenue of
$l6O-250 million (depending on whether
or not the Australian encouragement
bonus is retained in indigenous crude-
oil prices) by 1972. I nipped in and

Even better than uranium?
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
WATCH OUT for rare earths. They
could mean even more to the Mary
Kathleen Uranium mine than was sug-
gested in these pages last week. For
the chairman of MKU, Mr. Blake
Pelly, has now told the annual meeting
that it has already been established that
it is technically feasible to produce rare-
earths concentrates at the mine and that
it is only a question of marketing. Since
MKU’s parent company, Conzinc
Riotinto of Australia, is itself a subsidi-
ary of Rio Tinto Zinc, which dominates
the world’s rare-earths business, it seems
that marketing should present no prob-
lems provided it suits RTZ to have
this deposit worked in competition with
others in the group.
But there is more to this than simply
getting rare earths out of the residues
from uranium mining that has already
taken place; the remaining ore body
is rich in them and jusf how rich has
not been established. So it could be
that a joint extracting process that
removed both uranium oxide and the
rare earths would prolong the life of
the MKU mine by 30 years and
that is according to the company itself.
But there are problems involved in
the double process even though it is
the most economic in the long run. In
the first place, the Government’s ban
on uranium exports, unless there are
additional reserves discovered, means
that it would be unwise of MKU, the
company says, to proceed with joint
extraction until it pushed its proven
uranium reserves up to 5000 tons from
the present 1500 tons. At the moment
the company is working on trying to
find further reserves. So the extraction
of rare earths from the tailings seems
to be the first step in MKU’s mind,
even though it would work out more
costly in the end.
And the company also siays that it
has been operating a pilot plant for
some' time, but no information is being
released about grades. In any event, it
is clear that directors know a lot more
about the project than has been publicly
stated and have been investigating the
rare earth content of the tailings for
the last two and a half years; they have
always known that there were rare
earths in the deposit.
In any event, it is now becoming
more likely that the rare-earths opera-
tion could be of major significance to-
MKU, and possibly could be worth
more than the uranium in it, particu-
larly as it could extend the life of the
mine for so long and also increase the
economic level of ore body for the
associated extraction of uranium, much
of which may be in deposits whose ore
content would otherwise have made
them uneconomic to work.
Mr. Pelly told the meeting: “Very
few concentrated deposits of rare earths
are known to exist, and by nature they
seem more likely to occur widely dis-
seminated with other minerals in rock
formations.
“Rare earths occur, however, in the
Mary Kathleen ore body as minor
elements with the uranium. After
extraction of the uranium in the original
mining operations, the rare earths that
were contained in the ore remained
in the mill residue which is now stored
in a tailings dam and is available for
further treatment, if this is decided
upon. It is the retreatment of these
tailings that now holds the principal
possibility of establishing an economic
operation for the recovery of rare earths-
at Mary Kathleen.
“As processes have been developed
to allow less costly separation to take
place, uses have been found for two
of these rare earths yttrium and
europium in color television, and
cerium has a variety of uses in glass,,
paints, and as an alloying agent in
other metals. Uses are also increasing
for the other rare earths. For instance,
neodymium has properties that make
it possible for glass to be made that is
opaque to ultra-violet rays and is used
as a catalyst in cracking crude pet-
roleum, together with other members of
the rare-earths group.
“It has already been established that
it is technically feasible to produce rare-
earths concentrates at Mary Kathleen.
We are dealing, however, with products
for which marketing patterns and op-
portunities are only now being
developed and this aspect with all
others is being closely examined. It is
too early yet to say whether or not a
profitable operation can be mounted for
production of rare earths at Mary
The Chartist says:
PACIFIC ISLAND MINES LTD. is possibly a stock for the more speculative
minded investor, but the chart pattern suggests that this stock is about to commence
a move of major importance. Price movements between 27c and 59c took place
during the period of consolidation in 1966/67. The rise to 72c several weeks ago
on very heavy volume could be classified as a breakout from the congestion area
with targets of approximately 90c, $1.15, and $1.50 as the minimum probable
moves. Any price rise now accompanied by heavy volume would be a confirmation
of the possibility of a new uptrend. Last sale price on 21/3/68 —61 c.

SO WHAT IS the market going to do
now? Last week two bogies were
settled, even if only temporarily, when
the gold problem ended up in a dual
market that really meant a refusal to
increase the price, and when the
British Budget brought up additional
restraints on British portfolio invest-
ment in Australia. There are still some
bogies to be faced, like the seasonal
run-down in local liquidity, the impact
of cost rises on industry the year
following the wages case and industrial
unrest, and the fact the British inves-
tors who have made killings on stocks
bought a year-ago when the boom be-
gan can now take their profits without
attracting the worst part of the British
capital gains tax. But where else can
they invest in such a lively market?
This cash will stay here. So, all in all,
the outlook for Australian share prices
has improved considerably in the past
week. And for the benefit of those
people who nervously watch the New
York market for signs of the disaster
that the Cowan service has been fore-
casting for some time, things still look
reasonable over there, too.
But gloom still persists. The Cowan
service, for instance, which earlier last
week had encouraged its subscribers to
sell at least half their equity holdings
in all stocks except gold producers and
to place the cash at call in reputable
companies, still regards the outlook for
equity investment with “a good deal of
suspicion.” It says: “The market may
see a modest return of strength in the
short term, but we can see no lasting
strength a rally in the region a little
below the previous top of the index
(490) may develop, but failure to sur-
pass this level would have to be re-
garded as a bearish sign.”
The reality seems to be, however,
that the current world uneasiness has
made Australia all the more attractive
as a site for foreign investment. The
steady growth (with only relatively
modest cost pressures, although the
latest wage problems are raising them
again) of recent years and the generally
favorable economic indicators along
with assured markets for great volumes
of Australia’s exports combine to make
Australia look a far better place for
investible funds than, say, Britain.
While other economies slow down, there
will be mounting interest in ours
provided we can keep it going along
at a reasonable pace.
And we have one special advantage:
even if exports failed to reach our
objectives, this would have little direct
impact on the economy; employment
in export industries is fairly small and
provided the rate of capital inflow can
be maintained to keep our balance-
of-payments healthy, then temporary
downturns in export industries (like the
drought’s current assault) can be easily
overcome.
So this is not turning out quite so
gloomy a time as had been feared. The
only danger is that share prices could
ease a bit in coming months out of
boredom; markets need something to
excite them and there does not seem
to be much that is really exciting on
the stocks, at least for the equity
market. But for oils there should be
continuing interest, with the Alliance
group now taking the spotlight.
ON TOP OF confirmation of our re-
cent forecasts of the public float of
Abrolhos Oil (a Longreach associate),
last week saw two new floats announ-
ced in mining and oil that have in-
teresting associations. Coming from the
Magellan Petroleum stable, the two are
Southern Pacific Petroleum and Central
Pacific Minerals and are under the
chairmanship of one of Australia’s most
impressive younger businessmen, Mr.
lan McFarlane former stockbroker
turned company promoter who runs
Trans Pacific Petroleum (the company
sponsoring the new floats) and who
is a very important board member of
the Rothschild-backed Sydney mer-
chant banker International Pacific
Corporation. It is also significant that
IPC directors Evelyn de Rothschild and
Simon Heath are on Trans Pacific’s
board.
Unlike the Abrolhos float, in which
Longreach shareholders will get entitle-
ment, Magellan shareholders will get
no priority in the coming $4 million
issue of Southern Pacific (which will
participate initially in drilling for oil
in the Amadeus Basin) or the $ 11-
million issue of Central Pacific, which
is to conduct a mineral search in cen-
tral Australia, north of Alice Springs.
It is notable that neither the brokers
represented on the board of IPC nor
Mr. McFarlane’s former firm are asso-
ciated with the current issues, which
are being underwritten in Brisbane by
Lance Tones and Co. and Wilson and
Co.
WHAT does Pioneer Concrete have
to do next? Last week the company
reported a satisfactory increase in
profits for the December half, and
gave a confident prediction that earn-
ing rate for the year will be maintained
on capital enlarged by a one-for-five
premium issue in November.
But a chartist from Melbourne last
week was forecasting gloom for
Pioneer Concrete. The technical pic-
ture he sees on the chart spells to
him serious trouble and he predicts a
downside target of $1.06.
Our Chartist is also facing a funda-
mental problem with Pacific Island
Mines, this week’s recommendation
following the weekend’s news that the
$700,000 spent on developing the gold-
lode under the old mine on Misima
Island is to bring in no rewards as
the ore body is limited and operations
have been suspended.


OUR CFIARTIST comments further
on Peko Wallsend: This stock was
originally recommended as a technical
buy at $2.71 in June, 1967, with a mini-
mum probable move to $3.80. A rising-
trend at the rate of approximately 500
percent appreciation per annum has
continued, and the stock could be safely
held at present. There is a possibility
that prices could eventually move up to
targets at $14.00 and $20.00, but wide
price swings can be expected. Any
important change in trend will be re-
ported. Last sale price on 22/3/68
$9.80.
But this is one case where Chartists
have fallen out. The Sydney “Sunday
Telegraph’s” Chartist disagreed com-
pletely at the weekend, suggesting that
Peko’s share “may be in the early stages
of a downward movement of some
significance.”
1 FIE BRITISH HAVE always been big
in property development in Australia.
And it looks as if they will continue
to be now that the U.K. budget has
brought no extra curbs on sending cash
to the Commonwealth. The impending
takeover of Arndale Property Trust
Ltd. by Town and City Properties in
the U.K. may have important impli-
cations in Australia. Arndale Develop-
ments (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. has been hav-
ing problems finding enough capital
with which to operate. Town and City,
the favorite son of the Prudential As-
surance, should be able to overcome this
problem. If the bid succeeds and Mr.
A. Hagenbach, co-founder of Arndale
Property, and other major shareholders
favor it Town and City plan to
spend millions of dollars in Australia.
Concentrating on office blocks, Town
and City already has a multi-storeyed
block in Melbourne, opened last year,
and is currently considering a sl4m.
development in Roma Street, Brisbane.
Shopping centres are Arndale’s spec-
ialty. It has centres at French’s Forest
in Sydney, Croydon in Melbourne, and
Kilkenny and Mario in Adelaide.
The latter opened a couple of weeks
ago, and 79,000 people visited the
centre on the first day’s trading.
The Melbourne market
Sheltered stocks
for the timorous
IT IS A SAD STATE of affairs, some
brokers admit, that share markets turn
this way or that on the degree of sup-
port afforded by overseas investors. You
can’t get away from this fact of life, of
course, but it is pretty painful to watch
in operation, as last week, when shouts
for joy went up when Mr. Jenkins failed
to do what many people think he should
have done and helped the British bal-
ance of payments by shutting the escape
route for private capital transfers. It
is not for us to complain, nor to tell
him his business, but there it is. At
least the immediate future of markets
has been secured by his decision and,
helpful though it is to the outlook for
share prices here, it’s rather uncom-
fortable to feel that the thread could
easily have been severed and that there
is still a chance that it will be.
Some sections of the market must
inevitably be influenced by particular
overseas events. Certain companies can-
not escape the consequences, say, of an
event like sterling or the N.Z. dollar
devaluation which affects overseas earn-
ings not only of industrial companies
like Henry Jones, Hanimex, Felt and
Textiles, and CSR but also of pastoral
companies which have a lot more -—-
drought and low wool prices for in-
stance - to contend with at the
moment. Equally, the broad sweep of
international financial events such as
the gold play, which more and more
looks like a battle of economic warfare
waged by France, influences markets in
a similar way. Though we hardly need
evidence, we saw this with a vengeance
last week when for a time golds were
being bought almost recklessly, then
were being sold again in an even greater
hurry. It is all very nice when inter-
national events are working in your
favor, but the fact that they can turn
sour these days in startling echo of a
purchase shows how vulnerable invest-
ment in shares largely subject to their
twists and turns can be in current cir-
cumstances when, to put it mildly, the
international monetary system, as we
know it, is under stern test.
No listed investment can perhaps opt
out of all this entirely, at any rate in
the long run, because these broad in-
ternational influences are bound, to
some extent, ultimately to be reflected
along the whole Australian kaleidoscope
of industrial and commercial com-
panies. But, notwithstanding this, so
long as official policy here keeps to
its present course and tries to maintain
internal activity at full employment
levels, albeit at the risk of inflation, the
average Australian company whose
operations are primarily concerned with
the domestic market is not likely to
come to much harm, and is likely to be
helped by inflation. For this reason
it is rather remarkable that so many
good industrial companies, big and
small, continue to go their pleasant way
almost unnoticed by the market.
If the term “sheltered industry” has
rather gone out of fashion in recent
years what with the Tariff Board
doing its stuff more nobly than ever for
local industry and monopoly situations
rampant here and there you don’t
have to look further among listed com-
panies than in earlier days to find many
that completely fill the bill.
To mention a few of these: G. J.
Coles in retail stores, APM and Associ-
ated Pulp in the paper industry, Kel-
vinator in domestic appliances, Swan
Brewery in beer, Commodore Motels
in the general accommodation and
liquor business, Bell Bros, in transport,
Mcllwraith McEarcham in coastal ship-
ping, the Herald & Weekly Times in
newspaper and TV, and (we shouldn’t
say it) Evans Deakin industries whose
recent result was so dismal. These few
companies, with a wide geographical
coverage, are mentioned not because
investors should necessarily get into
them but more to show what a catholic
range of investment issues of all sizes
and shapes in sheltered industry is there
to be examined by anybody following
the thought that the more you can in-
sulate the bulk of your portfolio from
the ever-contrary international climate
the better.
Insulating your investments against
the weather proper is another matter.
An increasing number of firms serv-
ing rural industries in the currently
fried-up south-eastern section of the
country are showing signs of strain. It
is not just public listed companies. A
lot of proprietaries are also feeling the
pinch. Last week Clements Pty. Ltd.,
the Melbourne-based oat-processing firm
which only last year spread its wings to-
Peru and Malaysia, was put under
official management. Going on the ex-
perience of this firm which now has
no oats to process or ship because of the
drought, and whose search for finance—
a mere $150,000 to carry it over
failed after frantic efforts to get the
Victorian and Federal Governments to
chip in (the latter through the Com-
monwealth Development Bank), in-
vestors should take a good look at listed
investments like flour millers who, be-
hind their masks of feigned prosperity,
could be in similar straits.
Maybe agricultural-machinery makers
could also be having a rougher trot than
any of their results so far reveal. The
latest is from Connor Shea, which last
week reported lower profits for the
latest six months without supporting
figures. Despite this there was a slight
increase in sales for the period, a falling
off in those in drought-affected areas
being more than offset by increases else-
where. Nonetheless, the board gives the
impression it is keeping its fingers
crossed for a break in the drought to
save its results for the full year. (It
seems fully confident, though, that the
improved trend in results from its sub-
sidiary Cranvel Industrial Equipment
will continue.) The market prefers to
sit on the sidelines, rating the shares on
a 6J percent basis. This compares, say,
with 5.2 percent on Ralph McKay,
whose dividend was covered 2.2 times
last year as agamst 3.1 times for Connor
Shea’s. Although McKay’s net assets
backing is half as much again higher,
120 cents a share as against 80, there
wouldn’t be much difference in the
profit prospects. But, if the dividend
yield difference between the two com-
panies looks rather anomalous, it could
also be that both are fully priced in the
short run. But, for counter-cyclical men,
both could have their attractions.


Security analysis
Hunter Douglas’ major role
in aluminium growth
HUNTER DOUGLAS was launched
over 30 years ago by Henry Sonnen-
berg, who is still the controlling force
behind the group. With its holding
company in Montreal (Canada), its
large manufacturing operations in Rot-
terdam (Netherlands), its selling offices
in London, Dusseldorf, Lucerne, Milan,
and Paris, and with the group’s interests
extending to South America, South
Africa, Australia, and New Zealand,
Hunter Douglas is the world’s largest
enterprise in the metal window furnish-
ing market selling throughout sixty-
eight countries.
The company pioneered the con-
tinuous coating of metal strip, con-
tinuous casting and hot-rolling of alu-
minium, and the all-metal Venetian
blind system, including automatic
machinery for cutting and punching of
slats, head rails, and bottom rails used
in Venetian blinds. It has since expanded
into many fields utilising its special
skills in fabrication and painting of
aluminium, and is engaged world-wide
in the manufacturing and marketing of
a large range of window-furnishing
products and products for the build-
ing industry. In Europe, a substantial
part of Hunter Douglas activities is also
in sophisticated machine tool manu-
facture.
The company raised its flag in Aus-
tralia in 1954, and in 1961 acquired the
Sydney listed public company Mello-
Lite. The Ilunter Douglas Australian
company, in which local investors hold
over a 30 percent equity interest, is the
only member of the International HD
Group to be publicly listed. The com-
pany operates four factories in Australia
at Rydalmere (Sydney), on a 15-
acre site, and also at Waitara (Syd-
ney), Notting Hill (Melbourne), and
Campbelltown (Adelaide), and there
are company-owned sales offices in each
of the Australian mainland capital
cities. Group emloyment in Australia is
in excess of six hundred, which repre-
sents about 15 percent of the Hunter
Douglas International work force.
A dominant element in the company’s
growth has followed from the spec-
tacular growth of aluminium consump-
tion, which has soared from 5.21 b. per
head of population in Australia in 1957
to about 151 b. per head in 1968. The
lightweight, high strength-to-weight
ratio, ease of fabrication, pleasing ap-
pearance, and general versatility of this
metal are powerful reasons accounting
for the aluminium revolution, which is
predicted to have a very big future.
In the U.S., where the consumption
per head of population is double that
of Australia, aluminium represented
about 6.3 percent of the steel consump-
tion on a volume basis in 1960, and an
authoritative estimate is that it will
represent over 13 percent in 1980 and
nearly 22 percent in the year 2000. The
price disparity between aluminium
and steel in the U.S. on a dollar per
cubic foot basis has fallen from a ratio
of more than 4:1 in 1940 to just about,
2:1 today.
Hunter Douglas might well control
about five percent of the total consump-
tion of aluminium in Australia, and
they are by far the king in usage of
aluminium in window and door furnish-
ings, such as in internal and external
applications of blinds, awnings, window
and door screens, and drapes. We don’t
need to be interior decorators to realise
the dominance which windows and
doors have in giving function and lend-
ing an atmosphere and character to
any room or building. The downright
ugliness of many Australian homes is
an object lesson in what to avoid for
the future. Possibly about 75 percent of
the company’s overall business is in
the supply of components and finished
products to the metal-window and door-
furnishings market.
About 10 percent of the company’s
products in windows and door com-
ponents is sold direct to the public, but
the dominant 90 percent is sold to
about two hundred independent Aus-
tralian firms who, working mostly with
Hunter Douglas brand names, assemble
the HD components into finished
products, measure and fit them for
homeowners, either working through
retail stores or supplying on a direct
basis to the homeowner, blunter Douglas
design and promote national advertising
programs for these products, and the
imaginative marketing and advertising
campaigns, believed to be costing over
five percent of the company’s annual
turnover, have ensured wide consumer
brand-name recognition for trade names
such as “Luxaflex,” “Mello-Lite,”
“Shademaster,” and “Kirsch.” Hunter
Douglas would probably control about
60 percent of the Venetian blind,
drapery, hardware, and aluminium
awning business in Australia, at least
30 percent of the aluminium screening
business and a smaller percentage again
of the holland blind market. These pro-
ducts collectively have an overall rate
of growth of about ten percent or so a
year, but in awnings, for example, the
potential rate of growth is much higher.
In other sectors of the company’s
business, building products account for
about 17 percent of turnover, and
“Cordex” ropes, twines, and lashings
for about eight percent. In building pro-
ducts, the company markets “Perma-
lum” precoated aluminium sidings for
precladding (that is the supply of an
external wall material) to the home-
owner seeking to “improve and
beautify” his fibro or timber house;
“Flexalum” aluminium and steel clad-
ding for new commercial and industrial
buildings; “Luxalon” metal suspended
ceiling systems; and “Permatile”'
aluminium roofing tiles.
It would seem that these products,
collectively, would have a rate of growth
of about 15 percent a year. In the dom-
estic-siding market, Australian con-
sumption is still only about one-tenth
of the U.S. consumption on a per head
of population basis. In the affluent
North American society, the cost of
tradesmen to paint exterior timber
finishes of homes is becoming prohibi-
tive, and, while there are plenty of “do-
it-yourself” home handymen around,
the desire for weekend pleasure and
leisure is turning many householders
to seeking metal cladding and trims,
which are lifetime materials not needing
to be repainted. Hunter Douglas, in
Australia, dominates the siding market
and is making quick progress in other
metal claddings. I was particularly
impressed with the development and
potential of the aluminium, roofing tile,
w r hich is in the shape of a modern
cement tile but is 1 -28th as light on an.
area-covered basis.

crease over the five years 1962-1967
was 73.8 percent in net earnings and
37.5 percent in assets employed, so that
the profit growth has been approxi-
mately double the rate of increase in
assets.
In the interim announcement released
in March, 1968, earned for ordinary
for the six months to December, 1967,
was shown as increasing to $506,242'
(up $42,187) on the corresponding
period of 1966, and the interim dividend
was hiked from five cents to six cents
a share, indicating a dividend for the
1967-68 fiscal year of 12 cents.
At $2.60, the $1 shares command a
dividend yield of 4.6 percent and the
price earnings multiple is 11.0, which
seems to me to be a reasonable price
to pay for this growth stock.


Behind the balance sheets
John Martin battles over
Adelaide’s consumers
IT HAS BEEN a dull sort of place for
a retailer in recent times; the drought,
low level of industrial activity, par-
ticularly in the consumer goods in-
dustries on which it relies so heavily,
and a pretty dull rate of expansion
have made South Australia one of the
least likely places to expect a retailer
to thrive in. But John Martin & Co.
has done remarkably well. And when
South Australia comes good again (an
end to the drought would be some sort
of stimulus), Martin’s should do a lot
better. For it has had to carry heavy
opposition as it prepares for the future;
it has increased its business, not only
in the city, where it is putting up
a big car park next to its Rundle Street
store, but also in the suburbs, where
it has led the way to regional shop-
ping. The problem is that good times
may not be just around the corner; there
is certain to be a growing shortage of
money later this year to add to S.A.’s
drought problems. And S.A.’s absurd
political situation must reduce outside
investors’ confidence in the State’s
stability.
There is no doubt about its ability
to do well in a dull period; last week’s
interim report showed a ten percent
net profit rise to $639,000 on top of
last year’s seven percent lift to $902,499
(after a half year profit of $580,000 and
high tax of $710,943). Directors expect
the second half of the year (always
lower than the first half) to be good
-enough to show a rise in profits and
sales over last year, so there will be
an even better cover for the 11 percent
dividend than last year’s percent earn-
ing rate.
So even in bad times, John Martin
has much more appeal than its current
share price would suggest; recent prices
around $1.05 for the 50-cent shares to
provide a price earnings ratio of ten
times are less than half those of four
years ago when to buy them cost 17.5
times their latest year’s earnings per
share.
The current high earnings yield and
the dividend yield of 5.2 percent, seem
to more than account for the current
year’s difficult economic climate and
the undeniable risks that any credit
retailer carries. And in terms of future
prospects, the price looks a bit too low,
particularly in view of Martin’s ability
to more than hold its own in one of
the most competitive retail areas in
Australia.
The battle for Adelaide’s consumer
spending entered a new phase a couple
of weeks ago with the opening of Arn-
dale Development’s $7 million shopping
complex in the southern suburb of
Marion. Here for the first time, Adel-
aide’s two biggest retail giants, Myer
(S.A.) Ltd. and John Martin are to
fight it out on an equal sized pitch, both
being equal-sized tenants of the new
project.
The quarter-mile on one side of
Adelaide’s Rundle Street, with three
major stores, Myer’s, Martin’s, and
David Jones’, is unique in retailing.
Myer’s, though handicapped by an old
and unattractive building, has, under the
skilful management of the legendary
Jimmy Martin, outsold the other two,
probably by a large margin. DJ’s, oper-
ating in fully rebuilt premises since
1962, has style, but of the three, it
probably has the smallest turnover and
profits, although DJ’s reported that its
Adelaide store had record sales and
profits for 1966-67.
Myer (S.A.), with only the Rundle
Street store, and the Clutterbucks chain,
earned a profit in 1966-67 of $2,384,000,
more than two and a half times that of
John Martin. Martin’s 1967 profit in-
cludes results of the suburban stores at
Elizabeth (110,000 square feet), Kil-
kenny (60,000 sq. ft. in the Arndale
Shopping Centre), as well as the city
store covering some 40,000 sq. ft., with
frontages to Rundle Street, North Ter-
race, and Charles Street. Kilkenny was
opened in November, 1963, Elizabeth,
in October, 1964, and although these
are very successful, the city store still
contributes by far the largest portion of
profits.
An unknown quantity in Adelaide re-
tailing is the future of Cox-Foys on the
“wrong” side of Rundle Street, which
has not yet been sold by the receivers.
Woolworths, buyer of much of the Cox
chain in W.A. and Victoria, is ap-
parently not interested in this outlet.
Martin’s was delighted with the first
day’s trading at Marion, and on that
performance, predict that their Marion
store’s results for the current year will
be better than budget. The quandary is
what impact an additional suburban out-
let (matched by Myer) will have on
the city store’s trading. The Marion
complex serves a growth area, but
Martin’s, perhaps unnecessarily, was
disappointed that Myer jumped on
their Arndale bandwagon and sought
equal representation (93,000 sq. ft.
each) in the centre.
Myer has lately announced construc-
tion of an equally big shopping com-
plex of their own at Modbury in the
northern suburbs, which will open in
October, 1970. Martin’s do not yet
know if they will have the opportunity
to participate in this venture.
It was Martin’s who initiated the
move to the suburbs when its Kilkenny
store opened in the Arndale centre
four and a half years ago. At worst
Martin’s felt it was risking $120,000 a
year in rent, plus the costs of clos-
ing if it failed. It was an unqualified
success, and Martin’s was very happy
to go with Arndale to Marion.
These suburban developments siphon
off business from the highly concen-
trated city trading area. To pump back
some trade to the city where all the
stores have big capital investment, car
parks are required. Here again Mar-
tin’s has the jump on its two nearby
competitors. The first stage of a seven-
floor car park to cost $4 million in-
cluding the land, will be opened at
the end of March. It will house 850
cars, and the company expects 10
percent return on the investment, plus
the benefits which cannot be computed,,
of sales which would have been lost
had this service not been provided.
In the construction of the $3 million-
plus car park building, Martin’s have-
incorporated lift shafts for possible sale
in the future of airspace above for
offices. Direct access will be given from
the car park to the city store by “over-
ways” but the car park will not be ex-
clusive to Martin’s customers. DJ’s is
having discussions with the Adelaide
Council about building a 600 car park~
Martin’s competitors, Myer’s and
DJ’s, are both only local branches of
national groups; Martin’s makes a
virtue of the fact that it is South Aus-
tralian owned, staffed, and managed. It
does not admit to any interstate aspir-
ations, and the S.A. country towns are
too small to warrant branch stores. But
it nevertheless gets one of the major
benefits of a national chain, buying
strength, through its buying link with
Grace Bros., Boans, Fitzgeralds, and
McDonnell and East.
Martin’s suburban developments in-
cluding the bulk store at Lockleys
opened in 1964 have been financed
mainly by a heavy resort to borrowing,
along with a small (one-for-six) par
issue to shareholders and an issue to-
institutional investors at 200 percent
premium both in December, 1963,.
by internal cash generation of about
$900,000 in the last couple of years.
In the last four years to July 31, 1967,.
capital has increased by $1,180,000,.
reserves and accumulated profits by
$2.9 million, and borrowings (long-term
liabilities, deposits, and debentures and
overdraft) by $6.7 million. And since
the last balance sheet, the company
has raised $3 million debenture money
by a private placement to financial in-
stitutions for general expansion, the
Marion store and car park.
With long-term liabilities of $15.2"
million, (greater than the $11.2 million
of shareholders’ funds or the $14.2 mil-
lion of fixed assets), the interest burden
is already considerable, without reckon-
ing on the latest $3 million raised. In-
terest on debentures and fixed-term

loans in the past two years has been
around $1.2 million, well in excess of
the profits available to shareholders. The
financial structure of the business, so
heavily based on borrowings, tends to
be inflexible should retailing conditions
deteriorate.
But the company calculates that it
has $12.2 million owing and payable to
it within two years, against $7 million
payable by Martin’s within two years.
Its liabilities seem fairly well scheduled,
and with a considerable amount held by
institutions rather than individual
borrowers, the position is not as in-
secure as it may appear.
It is striking that, despite what was
probably a nine percent rise in sales
last year, its debtors fell and its stock
rose by only four percent, indicating
better retailing practice. As Martin’s
carries its own hire purchase, its debtors
of $7.9 million (down from $9 million
in 1966) are high in relation to those of
Myer (S.A.), which sells off its debtors
and showed only $2 million in its
books. The $l.l million fall in Martin’s
debtors came by reducing the average
period of repayment of goods sold on
extended terms, and the amounts ad-
vanced as secured loans. Martin’s stock
situation is clearly not as good in rela-
tion to profits or turnover as Myer’s
(S.A.), for Myer’s stock of $4.8 million
was only a little higher than Martin’s at
$4.1 million (up $200,000 in the latest
year), although Myer’s profit is 2\ times
as big.
Apart from the fact that retail prices
are not rising very fast (the consumer
price index shows that the price of
clothing and drapery household supplies
and equipment has risen considerably
less than food, housing, or miscellaneous
costs), with the growing affluence of
the community, proportionately less is
being spent on the items that most re-
tailers sell, and more on housing, holi-
days, and transport.
No turnover figures are divulged, but
sales have nearly trebled since 1957.
Sixty percent of sales are on credit. As
it has a substantial white-goods business,
and big furniture, furnishings, and floor
coverings departments, provision of
credit is a necessary adjunct of the
business. But as the company borrows
at 8 percent, and incurs perhaps another
1 percent in accounting costs for credit
accounts, there is not much additional
profit to be obtained from credit opera-
tions in themselves; they are really a
method of making sales.
Martin’s followed Reid Murray in
offering goods on no deposit, and
although Reid Murray collapsed, Mar-
tin’s is still prepared to do such busi-
ness if the credit is good. Martin’s con-
siders it makes credit easy to apply for,
but not necessarily easy to get. The rate
of credit rebuffs is quite high. Directors
are satisfied that adequate provision
has been made for any possible losses
on failure of accounts, but the provi-
sion for doubtful debts is lumped
together with deferred gross profit on
extended credit sales ($929,000), so
the proportion of debtors which are
considered suspect is not known.
But Martin’s is certainly taking care
to avoid the fate of other credit re-
tailers. At 1967 balance date, the com-
pany had $3.77 million invested in
short-term debentures and deposits,
which seems unnecessary liquidity, but
it believes in carrying big surplus funds
readily available for safety’s sake as
well as for expansion of the business, to
meet any repayment of maturing
liabilities, and to obtain maximum dis-
counts.
Another source of liquids if necessary
is the investment of $1.6 million in
shares (including $1,276,000 in listed
shares then worth $213,000 more on the
market), which is significant not only
for its size, consisting mainly of an 11
percent interest in FCA, the Bank of
Adelaide’s finance offshoot and shares
in South Australian Insurance Holdings
Ltd., on whose boards sits Martin’s
chairman Sir Edward Hayward. (The
three Hayward families have a con-
siderable shareholding in Martin’s.)
Martin’s board looks at the FCA in-
vestment as a good return of ten per-
cent tax free; the overall return on
book value in 1967 from listed invest-
ments was 6.7 percent and 7.2 percent
from non-listed investments, both tax-
free. Compared with what these funds
could earn in retailing, or even con-
sidering the eight percent cost of bor-
rowing $1.6 million, these investments
appear a high price to pay for safety
but a justifiable one.
Apart from the 1963 cash issue the
company has treated shareholders to
two one-for-one bonuses, in May 1957
and November, 1959. The current im-
balance of equity capital and loan funds
suggests a need for a cash issue to
shareholders, unless the company takes
the view that its credit operators are
now big enough for investors to regard
it more as a financier than a retailer.

Mining
Choose gold stocks carefully
ALTHOUGH THE LONDON Gold
Pool has not yet reopened, it is already
clear that the actual rise in the price
of gold has turned out to be a lot less
than anticipated by many who have
been heavy buyers of Australian gold
shares in recent months. There is, of
course, always the possibility that, in
the longer term, conditions will exist
requiring higher prices. But, as things
stand, the extent of the current rise
has meant that a far more discrimina-
ting approach is needed in choosing
the right gold shares to buy. Up to
now it has been easy to maintain that
the rise, when it came, would be suf-
ficiently large to benefit all local gold
producers, and the selection of any
particular company has been in many
cases decided by the existence or not
of non-gold activities carried on, such
as Lake View and Star’s nickel explora-
tion program at Lake Rebecca.
The time of reckoning has now come;
and it is not made any easier by the
special position of the gold companies,
which in Australia are not only subject
to the Gold Mines Assistance Act,
which provides subsidies, but also the
Banking Act on account of gold’s
unique position. The combination of
these two Acts had stockbrokers last
week vacillating between positions as
sellers and buyers. The Banking Act
restrictions were sorted out fairly
readily as soon as it was pointed out
that gold companies have never been
restricted by this Act to selling their
output to the Reserve Bank at the
official price and, indeed, some
companies have, in the past, occasionally
sold gold to overseas customers at
prices fractionally higher than the
official price of $A31.25. This Act
provides that whereas all gold must
in the first instance be sold to the
Reserve Bank, at $A31.25 per ounce,
it can be repurchased at this price if
within two months the producer can
obtain a higher price for it from an
overseas source. Thus local miners can
take advantage ’ of the best market
offering.
Whether this will in fact mean that
they sell gold abroad on the free mar-
ket is not at all certain. For those
companies not at present receiving any
subsidy the picture is quite clear —■
they will attempt to sell gold overseas
for a price in excess of the $A31.25
which is all the Reserve Bank will offer
them. But, for some of the companies
which do receive the subsidy there will
be no particular incentive to sell over-
seas unless they can obtain prices in
excess of $U.5.43.90 per ounce after
freight, etc., say $U.5.44.
The reason for this is that should a
goldminer in receipt of subsidy receive
more than $A31.25 per ounce, the sub-
sidy paid is reduced by the excess over
that price. The maximum subsidy pay-
able is SAB per ounce, and unless a
producer such as Hill 50 can get more
than $A39.25 (i.e. equivalent to
$U.5.44), it is no better off by selling
abroad. Hill 50, for example, pro-
duced 40,000 ounces of gold last year
and, after receiving the maximum sub-
sidy allowed of $8 per ounce,' it made
a loss of $28,000. If it now sells its
gold for a dollar more than the pre-
vious price of $A31.25 it loses a dollar
of the subsidy it receives, which last
year amounted to $329,000, and would
therefore have no special incentive to
sell abroad until it can sell its gold
for $U.5.44 or more. At $U.5.45 it
would break even with a very small
profit, while a gold price of SU.S!7O
would be necessary for it to earn a
profit approaching ten cents a share.
Other companies now receiving the
maximum subsidy of $8 per ounce are
A 1 Consolidated, North Kalgurlie,
Great Boulder Gold Mines, and Gold
Mines of Kalgoorlie, while Lake View
and Star and Central Norseman receive
amounts of subsidy at rather lower
levels, Central Norseman having be-
come eligible for subsidy only this
year.
The actual terms of the subsidy paid
by the Federal Government are that
goldminers will be reimbursed for
three-quarters of the amount by which
their costs exceed SA27, and that the
subsidy has an upper limit of SAB.
Thus any producer receiving the maxi-
mum subsidy must be operating at
costs in excess of $A10.65 per ounce
and losing at least $A2.65 per ounce.
Obviously, the companies which will
reap the benefit of higher prices soonest
are those which are receiving the least
subsidy at present Central Norse-
man and Lake View and Star, and
Wattle Gully while those not getting
any subsidy at all will be the first bene-
ficiaries —these include Peko-Wallsend
(with its subsidiary Mount Morgan),
Australian Development, Golden
Plateau, and New Guinea Gold. Both
Peko and Mount Morgan are presently
exporting their gold production in the
form of copper concentrates from Peko,
and blister copper from Mount Morgan
(to Japan in both cases) but there has
been no statement from Peko as to
whether the prices for these products
will be raised to take account of the
higher gold price.
Apart from the possibilities for
revenue increases, the higher gold price
will have other effects on Australian
producers, particularly those operating
at Kalgoorlie. For some years now
costs in the industry have been at high
levels due to the difficulties encoun-
tered in working at less-than-capacity
levels. The major problem has been a
shortage of labor which the develop-
ment of the northern part of Western
Australia has done nothing to help
and, because of the fixed gold price, the
mining companies have been in no
position to offer very attractive wages.
Now that some companies at least will
be in a position to attract more labor,
and will no doubt attempt to do so
following the incentive given by the
higher gold price, labor costs through-
out the industry at Kalgoorlie must be
expected to rise, and although the
companies receiving little or no subsidy
will be able to offset these higher costs,
those which are on maximum subsidy
will have to suffer this burden (or at
least one-quarter of it) during the time
it takes for gold to rise sufficiently to
offset this factor.
So, while such tables as the one pre-
sented last week do have some use in
comparing the relative merits of the
various companies at gold prices of,
say, SU.S.SO or more, they can be mis-
leading when it comes to assessing the
likely worth of goldminers now that
the gold price rise is a matter of fact
rather than speculation. And on the
presumption that the miners will be
attempting to increase production (in
an effort to lower costs) there will be
a change in the present pattern of
production. Lake View and Star has
capacity to treat about 900,000 tons of
ore, but, due to shortage of labor, was
only able to treat 734,000 tons last
year. Now that it can attract labor,
ore throughput will gradually rise and
gold production increase from the
142,000 ounces produced last year to
perhaps 180,000 ounces. North Kal-
gurli’s output last year of 63,800 ounces
could rise to over 80,000 ounces when
the gold price is high enough, and
Great Boulder has capacity to produce
about 50 percent more than last year’s
77,000 ounces.
For the time being, at least, it would
be best to stick to those producers
which are receiving little or no subsidy
and which, in addition to this, are less
likely to be affected by the increases in
costs which are probable at Kalgoorlie.
This narrows the field down con-
siderably, but still leaves scope for
profitable investment. New Guinea
Goldfields is selling for 80 cents; last
year this company earned 6.7 cents per
share, of which half (approx.) came
from goldmining; at a gold price of
about SU.S.4O, earnings from gold
would rise to 5.4 cents per share to
give total earnings of 8.4 cents per
share; at a gold price of $U.5.45 total
earnings would be 10.1 cents a share.
Golden Plateau, a Queensland com-
pany, is also around 80 cents; earnings
last year were 6.3 cents a share, but
would rise to 12 cents and cents
respectively at SU.S.4O and $U.5.45.
Wattle Gully, which receives a subsidy
of $4.50 per ounce, would not benefit
until gold rises above $U.5.45.


Commodities
South-East Asian
tin hopes
HOLDERS OF TIN stocks who have
been going through something of a lean
time of late may draw some little com-
fort from the current bustle of pros-
pecting activity in South-East Asia
which will involve Australian interests.
The Rio Tinto-Zinc group and
America’s Bethlehem Steel are turning
their attention toward the off-shore
potential of Indonesia’s Riau Archipe-
lago in a venture which the “Financial
Times” of London reports will also in-
volve Riotinto of Australia; a 25 per-
cent stake will be offered.
According to reports, feasibility
studies have already been completed
and it is hoped that negotiations for
the opening up of this potential tin-
bearing area will be completed by the
middle of the year. Something like
10,000 square miles of sea and land
are involved. The terms of the con-
tract being aimed for would give the
three partners the right to work the
area for 30 years after the initial ex-
ploration stage has been completed.
Rio Tinto-Zinc will take on the
management of the project.
Recent trends toward the off-shore
prospecting for tin have followed on the
disappointingly limited successes of
attempts to find big new tin deposits,
on land. Rio Tinto-Zinc and Bethle-
hem Steel have also turned their atten-
tion to Malaysia. There, they are re-
ported to be making good progress in a
large off-shore area in the vicinity of
Penang, Perak, and Selanger.
Hopes for the Malaysian venture in-
clude the first production facility on a
pilot plant basis to be working at
Chankat Tualang near Ipoh in the near
future.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Overseas events, the gold crisis and the British Budget, were
dominant influences on Australian share markets last week.
Monday was the day for bargains as WMC fell to $6.70, Hamers-
ley to $8.20, CRA to $lO.BO, and BHP to $17.10, but most stocks
recovered lost ground by week’s end. Suspension of Phillip’s
Uramu well due to onset of trade winds cooled the fever for
Oil Search. Gold shares suffered in the confusion following
announcement of a two-tier system. Peko lost $1.20 on the
week, after dropping to $9.40. There was a special parcel of
268,600 ICIANZ shares at 6c below the market.

THE LAND
Schemes for drought-proofing
IT HAS CERTAINLY been a great
week for drought relief. Embattled
landholders in southern New South
Wales are, presumably, especially grate-
ful. They will not only be able to call
on all that extra governmental largesse;
nine teams of advisers from the farm
water supply branch of the Water
Conservation and Irrigation Commis-
sion are also temporarily at their ser-
vice.
Once again, the urgent and very
necessary measures cannot disguise the
traditional Australian ad hoc reaction
to these continuous periods of national
tragedy. All our knowledge and ex-
perience point to the brute fact of
recurrent drought in one part of the
country or another. Yet we seem unable
to regard this as a proper field for
forward planning which might lead to
more effective alleviation and control.
Perhaps some people, even some ex-
perts, may still believe this temporising
is the only way possible to cope with
sudden and apparently unpredictable
trouble. But the evidence, both scienti-
fic and economic, moves rapidly against
them. A rational policy and program
for drought is not only desirable; it is
achievable. The picture has been drawn,
if not completely filled in, by Mr. Don
Campbell’s recently published
“Drought: Causes, Effect, Solutions”
(F. W. Cheshire, bound $3.95, paper
$2.50). Mr. Campbell, over much of
his book, writes very much from the
heart. Yet the sorry story of waste and
destruction culminates in a plan which
could be attacked in matters of detail
or emphasis, but which at least shows
that some kind of national plan is
feasible.
Mr. Campbell nails his idea of plan-
ning forcefully to the mast right at the
beginning of the argument: “Australia
needs a new attitude to drought. We
must all become aware that droughts
are costing us a great deal of money,
that we could be more prosperous and
safer if droughts were beaten. Aus-
tralia needs a National Drought Re-
search Institute.
“The NDRI must be a Common-
wealth organisation. It must be sep-
arate from all other bodies. It must
have sufficient money to direct and
pay for all manner of research in
drought control.”
Mr. Campbell finds it quite easy to
establish, through the course of the
book, “that drought is an inevitable
hazard for the entire economy of Aus-
tralia, not only a setback for farmers.”
Quite sensibly he does not then defend
his plan as the only or best solution.
It provides a workable framework.
Many critics will immediately recoil
from the suggestion to set up a new
(Federal) Department of Drought,
complete with its own Minister for
Drought. There is surely, however,
a case for some form of unified, semi-
autonomous body “to consist of an
administration, research departments,
and a force of men and machines to
carry out drought-prevention work.”
Grandiloquent, you may say. In the
face of almost cyclical national disasters,
unnecessary you can’t say. When a
country lacks, for instance, any well-
based estimate of its farm dams and
bore resources, and hence of the water
available for stock in droughts, some
kind of all-over resource catalogue
should obviously be compiled. The same
goes for fodder storage and stock
shelter.
Don Campbell has become a firm
proponent of the “drought bond” notion
now being advocated by the Australian
Primary Producers’ Union and a few
other grower organisations. Under this,
farmers could buy bonds in good years
for cashing to purchase fodder in
drought years. What, Campbell wryly
mentions, though, if there is no fodder
to buy?
In view of the “Land” section’s com-
ments on farmer indebtedness a week
or two ago, the book’s reflections on
overdraft financing are particularly
interesting. Aptly titled “Everybody’s
Overdraft,” one chapter sets out to
prove that the present overdraft system
“has held Australian land production in
a financial strait jacket for more than
a century.” The attack is against a
system “that sustains but cannot
develop, that operates like a subsidy in-
stead of an incentive, and is found
wanting when the going gets tough.”
Budgeted loans, as described by Pro-
fessor J. N. Lewis, may well furnish part
of the answer. By such a method devel-
opment loans to primary producers are
actually supervised, or that, with ex-
pert guidance, any short- or long-term
project is put surely along its intended
path. Consultants, of course, are pro-
viding such a combined finance pro-
curement-supervisory function even
now. Mr. Campbell’s suggestion is that
long-term, low-interest money, properly
directed, is an essential element of all
schemes of drought-proofing. In terms
of the temporary and crippling palli-
atives now around, his advocacy
demands careful examination.
Agrisearch
A final solution for rabbits
HOPEFULLY, THE rabbits are in for
another drubbing. If all goes accord-
ing to plan, myxomatosis will get back
its old killing power and become once
again a major weapon in rabbit con-
trol. The CSIRO has begun distribut-
ing a new carrier, the European rabbit
flea. Unlike mosquitoes, which tend
to spread the less virulent strains of the
virus, this insect passes on the more
virulent strains. In Australia, mosquitoes
have been almost the sole agents for
infecting rabbits, but throughout Europe
the flea is the most important vector.
As soon as a non-fatal strain of the
virus appeared here, the mosquitoes
began distributing it far and wide and
actually immunising the rabbits against
myxomatosis. A rabbit that picks up
one of the weaker strains stays mildly
sick for a week or more. During all this
time it remains a source of infection,
whereas a rabbit hit with a virulent
virus is dead within a few days. Its
value as a reservoir of lethal virus dies
with it. Obviously, a mosquito is much
more likely to come across a rabbit in-
fected with a weak strain of the virus
than a rabbit with the fatal kind. More-
over, the mosquito is a very mobile and
active insect which patrols a large area
and hence has a good chance of com-
in S upon many rabbits. The combined
result of the spread of the weaker
strains, and the development of gen-
etie resistance by the rabbit, is that
outbreaks of myxomatosis can no longer
relied upon to reduce a rabbit popu-
lation by more than 75 percent,
The flea, on the other hand, is a
sedentary creature. It believes in stick-
ing to a good thing and only moves
on when its host dies. This habit auto-
matically ensures that it spreads only
the lethal strains. The rabbit’s
behaviour also helps. When sick unto
death, it usually seeks the shelter of the
warren in which to pass its final hours,
This gives its fleas a good chance of
finding another rabbit while they are
still infective. Also mosquitoes do not
penetrate into the depths of a burrow

and so can only pick up a fatal strain
during the relatively short interval
before the rabbit begins to feel
seriously ill and perseveres with its
normal activities above ground.
The quarantine authorities of the
Commonwealth Department of Health
are satisfied that the flea poses no
threat to any other creature. It was
imported by the CSIRO Division of
Animal Genetics about a year ago
from England and kept in isolation
while being tested on various Australian
native animals. In every instance it
preferred to starve rather than suck
their blood. It will not even live on
hares, and no domestic animals in
Europe have ever been bothered by
it. Laboratory technicians, who have to
handle rabbits loaded with the fleas,
report that they have never been
bitten.
Indeed, the flea is utterly dependent
on the rabbit. It cannot even breed
until the rabbit starts to breed. Appar-
ently the fleas need some component
in the blood of a pregnant rabbit in
order to attain sexual maturity. This
is of such vital importance to them
that they have developed an uncanny
skill for finding pregnant does. Ten
days before a litter is due, the fleas
arrive on the doe. Then, by the time
the rabbits are born, the fleas are ready
to lay their eggs, which are deposited
in the nest where they hatch. In this
way a new generation of fleas grows
U P ™ ith each generation of rabbits. The
fleas s e nsitlvlt Y for the hormones ot
pregnancy circulating in the rabbit’s
blood is so acute that they can detect
a threatened miscarriage. On such
occasions, they desert the doe like rats
from a sinking ship and hasten off in
search of another expectant female. As
a m atter of fact this is the second
attempt that the CSIRO has made to
bre ed up stocks of the flea for release
among the wild rabbit population. An
earlier attempt made by the Division
°f "Wildlife Reseatch failed, becaiise
at time it A\as not known that the
fleas can only lepioduce aftei they have
been picscnted with piegnant does.
Human intervention will still be
needed to make a success of this new
ploy. Highly lethal strains of virus will
have to lie distributed along with the
fleas, otherwise they will simply aid
the further spread of the immunising
strains. Fortunately, the virus some-
times evolves powerful strains as well
as the weak one. The Glenfield strain,
which was found by the New South
Wales Department of Agriculture in
the Dubbo district a few years ago, is
still very effective. Mr. W. R. Sobey
and colleagues, CSIRO Division of
Animal Genetics, recently developed an
easy means of inoculating rabbits with
virulent virus. By this method, dry,
live virus is deposited on an abrasive
powder. This dust adheres to a moist-
ened finger-tip thrust into it, and a
rabbit is simply infected by poking the
finger under its eye-lid. Apart from
the ease of the innoculation procedure
itself, the method has the big advan-
tagc that the dried virus remains viable
for several days even under warm con-
d,ltlons, Ibls means that , U can be se " l
through the mails to outback areas. It
is now hoped that many more land-
holders will co-operate in spreading the
infection.
Just as bad money chases out good,
the weak viruses will eventually again
supplant any virulent strains that the
flea spreads initially. This, therefore,
may well he the very last chance that
farmers will get to knock out rabbits
with the aid of the biological weapon,
They will need to organise immediately
to make the most of this opportunity,
In the last analysis, rabbit control de-
pends more on human behaviour than
on the behaviour of the myxo carriers,
the effectiveness of poisons, and so on.
New Zealand has recently tightened up
the legislation behind its notorious
“rabbit-killer” policy, which takes the
responsibility for actually killing the
rabbits out of the hands of the land-
holders, but taxes them to pay for the
control exerted by local Rabbit Boards,
Perhaps the time has come for us to
take another look at our social arrange-
ments for resisting the rabbit.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
How Hollywood
has changed
by SANDRA HALL
BARRY SULLIVAN strode into the
hotel lobby looking a lot taller than
all those trench coats and Air Force
uniforms ever indicated, and wearing
a big smile the camera seems to have
done its best to avoid during his 25
years of film-making.
He has the tanned, craggy look of
dependability that was one of the main
ingredients of the Hollywood style of
male sex appeal of the late ’forties and
’fifties. So perhaps it’s a comment on the
’sixties that he’s playing a “heavy” in
his current film, “It Takes All Kinds,”
now being shot in Sydney.
In his hotel suite, he ordered drinks
and sat down to examine the type-
writer the hotel has provided for him.
“I’m writing a play, and I’m hoping
to get a little time to work on it while
I’m here. I’ve done one which stank,
and a few television scripts.” He came
from the theatre to Hollywood in 1942
under contract to Paramount Pictures,
and has a stock of pungent memories
about those early days.
“In New York, we had this sopho-
moric viewpoint of theatre as the art
form despite the fact that film is
the biggest story-telling medium we’ve
got. But, anyway, I got over that and
went to Hollywood where I sat on my
behind for nine months waiting for my
first picture. You think in the beginning
that you’ll go to (Hollywood, stay for a
short time while you make money, then
get the hell out and go back to New
York. But once you’re there, you do
things so badly that it becomes a kind
of challenge for you to get them right.”
Sullivan has a robust way with a
phrase (another thing his films didn’t
record) and he had some colorful
things to say about the most taxing
of those challenges three and a half
years under contract for MGM, for
whom he made 17 films. “I used to run
from Loretta Young to Barbara Stan-
wyck to Esther Williams in the space of
two weeks. If it hadn’t been for the girls
in wardrobe, I’d have worn the wrong
shirt to the wrong picture more often
than not.”
Nevertheless, “The Bad and the
Beautiful,” one of those savage hatchet
jobs Hollywood periodically carries
out on itself, compensated for a lot
of the agony. It was directed by Vin-
cent Minelli and contained a formid-
able amount of the MGM talent of
the time including Lana Turner,
Kirk Douglas, Dick Powell.
“I adored that picture. For me,
Minelli was great, and the rest of the
cast wonderful. People said that the
picture was about David Selznick, but
it wasn’t Selznick it was actually
based on the life of a Broadway whizz
kid we’d all idolised back in New
York.”
For a man with a past so firmly
founded in Hollywood’s golden days,
Sullivan preserves remarkably little
nostalgia for it all. He’s more excited
about the shifts in power that tele-
vision forced on Hollywood.
“And the actors have changed, too.
Without the cast system, they don’t
Sullivan...all kinds of films
worry about the size of their parts any-
more. They’re working now as the
English actors always have—doing a
part that’s no more than a vignette
because they know the picture’s going
to be good. The parts I really want
this year are relatively small. That’s
Elia Kazan’s film of his book, ‘The
Arrangement,’ which may go in June,
the other’s a picture with Robert Red-
ford called ‘Willy Boy.’
“If I can get those,” he said, flashing
that smile the camera never caught,
“then it’ll be a pretty good year.”
Films
Right? Wrong?
Memorable!
by BEVERLEY TIVEY
Bonnie and Clyde. Director, Arthur
Penn.
“AT FIRST WE were going some-
where special now we’re just going.”
So in Arthur Penn’s film does Bonnie
Parker sadly sum up a career of crime.
For this is a genuine morality play,
ruefully and uncompromisingly pointing
out that the wages of sin is death and
you don’t even get much fun on the
way. The brief rampage of the Barrow
Gang may sound daredevil and glamor-
ous, but it’s shown to be a haphazard
combination of silliness, inefficiency,
discomfort, and discontent; finally, a
humiliating death.
Yet the movie astonishingly manages
not to be a tract but an absorbing enter-
tainment. It’s never pompous or self-
satisfied; there are no overt moral
homilies, but on the other hand it
doesn’t romanticise the Barrow Gang or
present them either as victims of cir-
cumstances or as heroes to be emulated.
Possibly the fact that Bonnie and
Clyde were a comparatively ordinary
pair may account for the extraordinary-
vindictiveness of their hunting down.
Big gangsters of the A 1 Capone type
have a certain larger-than-life impres-
siveness that, in a sense, puts them
outside normal standards. But Bonnie
and Clyde had no ambitions for power,
domination, even for unlimited wealth
and luxury.
Arthur Penn has an unerring under-
standing of the affinity between tragedy
and farce. The story of “Bonnie and
Clyde” begins in a mood o,f almost
slapstick comedy, with a cocky young
show-off and a bored, romantically
dreamy girl embarking on their rob-
beries with little but enthusiasm as
their equipment. Their first job is a
marvellously anti-climactic fiasco, but
they go merrily on, becoming almost
imperceptibly entangled in violence and
murder. Clyde’s first killing, indeed,
comes as the shocking climax to a
richly comic scene in which an oafish
associate manages to park the getaway
car almost inextricably; the brief, dis-
torted vision of a pursuer’s destroyed
face through the broken car window is
sickening, startling, yet curiously
inevitable.
The film is far from the claustro-
phobic urban backgrounds usually associ-
ated with crime drama. Burnett Guffey’s
lyrical photograph makes effective con-
trast between the violence of the story
and the quiet sylvan backgrounds.
The casting and acting are splendid,
but without detracting from the players,
particularly Faye Dunaway and Warren
Beatty, it must be recognised that this
is the director’s film.
Does a film like this do harm, glorify
violence, incite its audience to imi-
tation? I can’t think so. This is not a
story of superman above the law, but
of muddled and commonplace people
who were wrong, foolish, yet recognis-
ably human: whose brief, uneasy
notoriety brought them no content.


Adelaide Festival, theatre
Fallen survivor
by ROBERT WARD
A FESTIVAL of Arts should have
a shape, a purpose; it should not be
merely an occasion for indiscriminate
cultural gormandising ... or so a
good argument goes, and it was strongly
put by a number of critics at the 1966
Adelaide Festival. The Festival Gov-
ernors, apparently taking heed of this
criticism, quickly announced that in
1968 we would have a “Festival of
Northern European Arts.” Being a
natural conservative in my tastes, I im-
mediately envisaged massive Carl Orff
performances, recitals of Schoenberg,
perhaps a visit by the Berliner Ensemble
or the Dramatiska Teater of Stockholm,
and, on the more avant garde side, a
large exhibition of Klee. But the idea
was dropped, or quietly forgotten, with
perhaps the exception of one produc-
tion only: Colin Ballantyne’s of Gogol’s
“The Inspector General.”
This is a bitter, ironic comedy which
Gogol wrote early in the last century
as an anguished complaint about the
corruption of Russian municipal and
bureaucratic life. lit it, a junior clerk
from St. Petersburg is taken by the
scheming officials of a small village to
be a Government Inspector travelling
incognito. They take him in, fete him,
offer him bribes, which he cheerfully
takes, and discover after he has gone
that they have been duped. Then enters
the aide of the real Inspector.
There are a number of interpretations
a producer can give to this play, accent-
uating bitter realism or broad comedy,
and Colin Ballantyne has chosen broad
comedy. His designer, Murray Rule, has
produced a technicolor art nouveau
main set, and the cast tumbles around
this like so many cartoon characters.
Ted Hodgeman plays Hlestakov, and
his performance is a brilliant piece of
stylish clowning, elegant, lighthearted,
and superbly timed. He sets a standard
far above the reach of the rest of the
cast, who simply lack such lightness of
touch. Hedley Cullen’s Mayor is gruff
and lumbering, while his wife, played
by Valerie Mildred, gives to her part
a pasteboard giggling superficiality.
In overall design, the production fell
down mainly, I think, because the art
nouveau mode was not carried through
to the costumes and, even, possibly
Beardsleyesque characters.
Theatre 62 is presenting two plays
for the Festival, Anouilh’s “Poor Bitos”
and Bill Macllwraith’s “The Anniver-
sary.” “Poor Bitos” is a very interest-
ing play in which a group of modern
French aristocrats decide to bait their
arch parvenu enemy and member of
the French judiciary, Bitos. To do this
they arrange a dinner party in which
they all play the parts of characters
from the French Revolution. Bitos plays
Robespierre, the others play Robes-
pierre’s enemies. In the course of the
evening, Bitos-Robespierre is shown to
be a compulsive, twisted paranoid, while
the aristocrats are shown as ruthless and
effete.
“Poor Bitos” is tastefully produced
in the round by Richard Davey, who
also plays Vulturne-Count Mirabeau in
a manner richly self-assured and aristo-
cratically confident. In truth, he is the
only member of the cast who correctly
displays a condition of noblesse, but
one can easily suspend disbelief with the
others, for they act with restraint and a
fair eye to character. Unfortunately,
the play so entirely depends on Bitos-
Robespierre for dramatic cogency, that
the part demands a tour de force. Jona-
than Leigh makes Bitos simply a cranky,
nasty bourgeois, one who is rather in-
clined to spit.
Adelaide Festival, opera
Triumph, tragedy
by JOHN CARGHER
Tosca. Puccini. Elizabethan Theatre
Trust Opera Company. Her Majesty’s
Theatre, Adelaide.
NOTHING highlights the problems of
Australian music and theatre more
than the presentation of this Adelaide-
only “Tosca” with a cast which can be
equalled only in a major international
opera house. That the audiences of
Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane
should be denied the artistry of Gobbi
and Collier (who will sing also in Mel-
bourne but not in other States) is a
tragedy.
“Tosca” is the best, if not the most
popular, opera that Puccini wrote. More
so than “Boheme” or “Butterfly,” it
relies on the performances of singers
and orchestra to carry conviction. The
19th-century melodrama by Sardou, on
which it is based, needs great person-
alities to bring it to life and those we
saw were as evenly balanced as any
critic, let alone music-lover, could wish.
Any thought that Donald Smith’s
Cavaradossi might be overshadowed by
the two guest stars was dismissed from
his first entrance. This singer not only
has the voice to compete with Gobbi
and Collier he is also a consummate
actor and has the courage and authority
to stand up for himself without con-
ceit or pomposity when disagreeing with
the dictates of the conductor, as he did
during the opening performance.
There is a great difference between
a temperamental prima donna who
demands to have her way and a
singer like Donald Smith who quietly
insists on doing what he feels is right.
It is to be hoped that the good sense
of conductor Carlo Felice Cillario will
result in an amicable resolution in
Donald Smith’s favor.
Fortunately the personal magnetism
of the three principals more than made
up for any shortcomings of the even-
ing. Tito Gobbi far exceeded anything
we might have anticipated. Now in his
53rd year, a slight depreciation of the
famous Gobbi voice would not have
been considered unreasonable. Nothing
of the kind! Gobbi today sings with the
steadiness, quality, and power of a man
20 years younger, and if the voice is
different from the one we know from
his best period on records (1950-56),
it is certainly not inferior. As for hi«
acting, this dominates the stage at all
times.
Gobbi refuses to use his gift to up-
stage his fellow singers, even to the
extent of leaving the stage during
Tosca’s “Vissi d’arte,” lest he inadvert-
ently ruin their own dramatic contri-
bution to the opera. There is no false
modesty in his behaviour, but a demon-
stration of artistic integrity which
should be the aim of all great artists,
yet is that of so few.
The contribution of Marie Collier
in the title role was not on the level
of Gobbi’s on the opening night. Miss
Collier amply demonstrated that she is,
indeed, a superlative Tosca of inter-
national standing, yet had an un-
accountable and unnecessary case of
first-night nerves which affected her
voice, mostly in the last act; before
then she had poured forth the most
glorious sound an audience can ex-
pect of a singer.
Clearly the vocal aspects of Puccini’s
music are child’s play to her and the
dramatic impact of her personality is
strong enough to ensure her remaining
the central figure even in the presence
of a Gobbi. Her interpretation of Sar-
dou’s character is absolutely true to its
period.
The efforts of the local company to
support three stars of this calibre are
substantial. Ronald Maconaghie’s Sac-
ristan is vocally secure and dramtically
the equal or superior of any overseas
singer. For once we did not get a
drunken idiot, but a charmingly weak
character who is genuinely, and not
comically, afraid of the menacing
Scarpia. Spoleta (John Heffernan),
Angelotti (Luciano Borghi), and Sciar-
rone (John Pringle) are admirably in
character and Janice Taylor’s off-stage
Shepherd sounds unbelievably boyish, a
triumph of vocal acting.
The stage sets are old and undistin-
guished, yet blessedly realistic, the
drama thereby gaining immensely in
stature. Stefan Haag’s production is
also good in a conventional manner.
His preoccupation with physical in-
firmity among the many minor cameos
is apparently his trademark.
Regrettably I must note that con-
ductor Carlo Felice Cillario did not add
to the enjoyment of the evening. I am
reluctant to believe that this “Tosca”
is a yardstick of his qualities in the
Italian repertoire. Ragged playing may
be due to lack of rehearsal; the ignor-
ing of Puccini’s precise intentions, such
as the hasty dismissal of the great
funeral march in the last act, would
seem out of character with what we
have heard of Signor Cillario’s admir-
able qualities.

Art
A wilder Boyd
by ELWYN LYNN
Arthur Boyd’s Nebuchadnezzar. Bony-
thon’s, Adelaide.
German Art Today. South Australian
Gallery, Adelaide.
Richard Larter. Watters Gallery,
Sydney.
Triple Show. Kym Bonython’s, Sydney.
EXPRESSIONISM, which enraptures
Boyd and lurks around most of the
above shows, has conquered the Western
world, even Paris having a Soutine
and phlegmatic Albion a Bacon, but
the opening of the Boyd show in
Adelaide revealed areas of Philistia as
yet immune. Arthur Boyd is vehemently
serious about the hideous delusions that
torture his Nebuchadnezzar, so I am
mighty surprised at the facetiously
irrelevant introductory speeches made
by Mr. Bonython, who again referred
to the pie-eaters who frequent his race-
track, and the Chief Justice’s admission
that he knew nothing about art but,
and his supposition that he had been
asked to open the show because of
some of Nebuchadnezzar’s odd anatomi-
cal features.
This jocularly coy reference was to
the king’s übiquitous red testicles and
occasioned zephyrs of well-heeled
laughter.
Boyd’s is a set of looser, wilder works
than he has done; there is little of
his earlier, expressive symbolism, as
each painting is a symbolic event in
itself as Nebuchadnezzar eats grass,
devours the environment in a frenzy,
is lost among the succulent lilies
beneath a ravishing sky, sprouts blue
or yellow flowers from his naked back,
dissolves, not like the brides, but like
a tattered Lear, into the storm of light-
est pinks and electrical emerald greens
or thunderous reds. Some are indeed
savage with the bloody fire sweeping
on a man-dog, his mouth full of flame;
but, generally, the violence is tempered
by a new, lush sweetness of color, and
even the vulgarity of a Nebuchadnezzar,
in thick yellow paint, is countered by
the lyrical intensity of the painting of
the forest.
Some, like the king with a lion or
buried in slimy paint masquerading as
sand, are failures. In the best, with
touches of Nolan’s serene skies and
Corinth’s curdled brushstroke, he pre-
sents a raging and desolate madman,
his testicles the fiery furnaces of his
hysteria, as convincingly as Breughel
did Mad Margaret.
In his introduction to the German
paintings at Adelaide, Werner
Schmalenbach, whose definitive work on
Schwitters appeared in 1967, says that
international traits are now so dominant
that it’s vain to seek Germanic charac-
teristics and, in a brief argument that
should be read by local chauvinists,
raises the issue of individuality in mod-
ern art noted, he says, for “nakedness,
coldness, and soullessness.” In this ex-
citing show, two noted individualists,
who are coping with the aftermath of
action-painting, are Hoehme, with a
linear egg-shape wherein formalism
combats severity, and Schumacher, with
a dark blue board holed with black
craters; but Bruning, once a darting
action man, is now a Popcartographer.
Geiger, who was once concerned with
the shadow cast by vast, luminous areas,
is now fluorescence itself in two blind-
ing canvases where form dissolves in
color and his previous rigidity has been
adapted by Lausen in science-fiction,
soulless landscapes.
Only Pfahler seeks partial hard-edge
solutions with diagonal ribbons on sky-
blue and one of those huge, “meaning-
less” road-signs produced by Germans
in red on red. Kriwet has two black
canvases with jumbled letters, like a
Gothic Indiana, but quite chaotic.
Volkle places the primary impact of
the sign against a wild geometry, neither
cold nor naked. In the ’fifties Pienc
and Mack wanted to separate facets
of light from real objects, and Mack
has become more concerned with the
play of light on aluminium; here he
seeks a pale luminosity in stripes, and
Piene in the self-contained light of
stains. Far less subtle, Mavignier
organises light into optical spots.
Most delicate in line but less in sub-
ject is Barter, who issued a self-denying-
ordinance last year in support of
Michael Brown; his aged schoolgirls,
possibly all geology students for they
are drawn in fragile contour overlays,
with aggressive shame, lift their skirts
to reveal primary sexual character-
istics; quite different from the routine
lifting of skirts by Lautrec’s prostitutes
at the VD inspections.
Toulouse-Lautrec’s prints which I
noted in 1967 raise the issue of the
difference between caricature and ex-
pressionism, an issue Tony Wood’s
paintings of 1964 or so might have
helped, but he’s reined himself in over-
much and it’s to Inge King that one
must turn for expressive power. Pier
fellow sculptors, Lenton Parr, with fine
enamelled pieces classical in forms but
not in organisation, and Clifford Last,
who subdues organic forces with ele-
gance, are restrained; Miss King suf-
fuses her black-bronzed steel boxes
with internal pressure and external
forces, most evident in Great Boulder,
somewhat like a ravaged David Smith
with its large, rectangular cube crush-
ing four smaller ones. Simple in form
and technique like a Calder, it preserves
some of the expressive, accidental
quality revered by that careful colla-
gist, Schwitters, and here, and in her
splendid The Encounter, Dr. Schmalen-
bach might see some of the expression-
ism that informs many of the German
works so tellingly.


Theatre
Stale nostalgia
By DENIS O'BRIEN
This Old Man Comes Rolling Home.
Dorothy Hewett. Old Tote, Sydney.
Relatively Speaking. Alan Ayckbourn.
Phillip Theatre, Sydney.
A LOWING sigh of exasperated be-
wilderment. Mine. It can’t be happen-
ing, this piece of congealed nostalgia
on stage that masquerades as an Aus-
tralian play called “This Old Man
Comes Rolling Home.” People just
don’t write plays like this any more.
Or, if they do, they never get them
produced. But they do. And just how
and why this one obtained the privi-
lege of entering the Old Tote Theatre’s
season of Australian plays is a more
Martin Harris and Kirrily Nolan in
“This Old Man Comes Rolling Home.”
Sydney’s Old Tote Theatre
fascinating exercise in speculation than
the author’s puzzling view of low life
in Redfern. Did Messrs. Quentin, Love-
joy, and Brown select such an anachro-
nistic work as the best way to convert
the reactionaries to the so-called pop-
theatre of Sharman, Milgate, and Mor-
phett? Are we supposed to look at this
old-fashioned piece of theatre and be
ashamed of our preference for natural-
ism and realism instead of the surreal
and abstract? Is it a joke on us or
does someone deep in the University
of New South Wales Drama Foundation
really believe that this is the stuff that
encourages playwrights and builds
audiences?
The play offers a conventional
middle-class study of a working-class
situation. Fife is crook for the half-
heartedly stoical Dockerty family when
the play begins and it’s still crook at
the end; nothing has happened to re-
deem their state of hopelessness.
Tom Dockerty (Ron Haddrick) is a
prototype Australian battler with a bit
of work for the Communist Party on
the side to distinguish him from the
RSL type in Seymour country. His wife,
Lorraine (Betty Lucas), was once, so
she says, the belle of Bundaberg, but
now she nurses the bitterness of her
defeat in the bottle of cheap wine
which keeps her in an almost state of
blowsy drunkenness.
Around them are their children
the daughters (one of them a mental
defective) either promiscuous or des-
perately virginal; the sons corrupted
in one way or another. All of them are
victims of their own environment; that
much, at least, rings true. But all of
them are drawn in absolute black or
white which makes them incredible.
There is no identifiable plot in “This
Old Man Comes Rolling Home.” It
simply moves in on the Dockertys one
autumn and moves out again the fol-
lowing spring. Birth and death are the
only intervening dramas. Unfortunately,
Miss Hewett is not the writer to handle
such a tenuous conception for theatre.
She has tried to invest her play with
simple significance but has only achie-
ved a radio soap opera.
With such unrewarding material and
the palpably poor direction of Jean
Wilhelm, the cast don’t have much of
a chance. The Old Tote Company,
however, is now good enough not to
surrender to such odds and there are
interesting performances from Ron Had-
drick, Martin Harris, and Kirrily Nolan
whose luminosity held most of my
attention.
Googie Withers attaches something
of the same sort of appeal to the
comedy “Relatively Speaking.” She is
virtually all that this piece of gold-
plated frivolity has for me. Miss
Withers’ Shaftesbury Avenue expertise
never fails to fascinate me. One day
someone is going to write a play just
for the exercise of her eyebrows, mouth,
and chin. Meanwhile, she is lending her
talents to the simplicities of Alan Ayck-
bourn’s set of classic improbabilities
involving husband, wife, lover, and the
Other Man. Ayckbourn has cleverly
permutated the old situations to create
a fresh comedy of errors which has
the virtue of maintaining its basic
joke right to the end.
This is not a play that needs evalua-
ting. One looks at the title and the cast
(Miss Withers, her husband, John
McCallum, who also directs, Peter
Adams, and Rowena Wallace) and
knows immediately what to expect.
Physically fitted
By PHILLIP ADAMS
The Magistrate. Pinero. Russell Street
Theatre, Melbourne.
WHERE THE familiarity of faces in
foyers on first nights serves to remind
us that Melbourne is a smallish city,
the familiarity of the faces on stage
adds a dimension of difficulty to
repertory production. For when one
sees the same team tackle a dozen
plays in rapid succession, the actors’
mannerisms, intonations, and physical
characteristics inevitably obtrude and
work against a production’s mystique.
There’s real pleasure in seeing favor-
ite actors or actresses, but the frequency
of appearance that makes them favor-
ites makes it so much harder for them
to create a unique and convincing
characterisation.
At Russell Street, for instance, no
matter what the play, one can’t help
but be aware of Frank Thring’s vast
voice, thundei'ous and sibilant. Just
as there are always George Whaley’s
eyes to contend with glassily staring
as Pius or looming as big as portholes
in “Moby Dick.” Dennis Olsen’s
extraordinary teeth are a feature of each
production, grinning in comedy, grit-
ting in drama; on a par with that of
Cyrano or Jack Purtell, there’s John
Gregg’s nose, which has the habit of
upstaging him.
However, in George Ogilvie’s pro-
duction of “The Magistrate” such char-
acteristics are in no way liabilities.
Pinero’s rather tired old script is given
the same vigorous treatment as last
year’s Feydeau farce, and the cast are
encouraged to parody whatever peculiar-
ities of approach or appearance they
happen to possess. Whaley’s eyes pro-
trude to the point of recklessness,
Olsen’s bicuspids are impossibly scin-
tillating, and Gregg’s nose is every-
where, snorting and splendid.
As a result of the players’ overstate-
ment and exuberance, Pinero’s puns,
which are of the ouch and wince
variety, not only get- by but actually
seem funny. As well, Ogilvie has but-
tressed the weaker moments by incor-
porating music-hall songs which never
fail to disarm an audience.
The joke revolves around a widow
who, in underestimating her age to her
new husband, has had to take the same
five years off the age of her son. Thus
we have a huge 14-year-old boy of
strong sexual appetites, who gets his
innocent stepfather, the Magistrate, into
all sorts of bother. Gregg is the little
lad, and he’s enormously funny. Whaley
plays a blimpish Colonel, and, after an
uncertain start, has at least one bril-
liant scene, and Olsen’s sense of the
comic is as sharp as the tips of his
waxed moustache. The girls were good,
particularly Anne Pendlebury, a young
actress who is proving to be a valuable
acquisition to the company.


BOOKS
Manning Clark’s misfits
By PETER COLEMAN
A History of Australia. Volume 11.
C. M. H. Clark. Melbourne Univer-
sity Press. $7.80.
IT IS NOW the standard view that
Manning Clark is the man who brought
Pessimism into the writing of Austra-
lian history. The other day Dr. lan
Turner wrote with some admiration of
how Professor Clark broods over the
horror of life, and Dr. Patrick O’Far-
rell agreeing with Turner for once
praised Clark’s stimulating gloom.
It is clear enough what they mean.
Australian history in Manning Clark’s
eyes is a parade of misfits and victims.
Failure is the theme, at least of his
first two volumes, and the signs are
it will continue to be his theme in the
coming volumes. (Volume 2, just out,
takes us from 1822 to 1838 covering
the reigns of Brisbane, Darling, and
Bourke.) This is a welcome and stimu-
lating change from the common Whig-
gish or radical interpretation of
Australian history, in which everything
always turns out for the best, and in
the hands of a poet and beautiful
stylist like Manning Clark the failure
theme becomes almost irresistible.
And yet especially in this Volume
2 a forced, mechanical note seems
to have entered his writing. You begin
to predict what is going to happen to
any character as soon as he enters the
scene. You know he will hold such-
and-such quaint Reformation-Protestant
views of life and death. He will usually
be pious, with an eye to the main
chance although sometimes he may
be a simpleton indifferent to the world.
He will do certain brave, petty, or
mad things; soon the conflict between
the changing world and his hopes will
become apparent; he will become
another failure, and turn to his quaint
religion for comfort. Usually on his
death or departure he will be defamed.
But it seems to me that the last
word one should use of Clark’s vision
is pessimistic. His characters are not
so much tragic as pitiful figures. They
are like blind men wandering around
in the traffic; they are bound to be
knocked over sooner or later; they are
pathetic men, beaten in advance. But
the point is that Clark is on the side
of the traffic. Indeed, he is driving
one of the motor-cars, different from
the other motorists only because he
feels sorry about the road toll. His
history, in other words, derives from
his view of the decline of Christianity.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, accord-
ing to Clark, Christianity and
Protestantism, in particular, provided
the creed of the main Australian actors,
yet Protestantism and the Protestant
social order were already doomed by
the march of events and being replaced,
temporarily at least, by the Enlighten-
ment and a liberal social order. Hence
the failure and pathos, the series of
misfits. (Roman Catholicism does not
come in for the satire that Clark
reserves for Protestantism; Catholicism
was then the creed of those premature
misfits, the Irish underdogs, but Clark’s
writing is on the wall for Catholicism,
too.) It is in the end a cold, often
contemptuous view of life, tempered
by an occasional tear; the participants
are ridiculous.
Within such a framework a lot of
excellent history can be written, par-
ticularly by a writer with Clark’s
imagination. There are few books of
this length that I have read in one
sitting, but this was one of them. Yet,
leaving aside for a moment the theo-
logical core of the book, Clark’s
approach has two consequences worth
noting. His history is inevitably largely
a history of people for whom creeds
and doctrines are essential parts of
their ordinary lives which means
mainly clerics and politicians (includ-
ing Governors). The physical sides of
life business, exploration, industry,
agriculture, invention - play a small
part, in Clark’s volumes, and where they
appear, they are usually adjusted to
the religious creed of the protagonist.
The pages on the great explorations of
Sturt are, it is true, sympathetic and
as well written as anything by Clark,
but again the account begins and ends
with Sturt’s Protestantism and since
Sturt was obviously a good man, he
appears as a sort of simpleton. On the
other hand, the account of the explora-
tions by Hume and Hovell are among
the worst things Clark has done: in
order to make something ideological out
of them, their great feats are presented
in terms of the conflict between the
Protestant Pom and the dinkum Aus.
I remember a phrase of M. H. Ellis’
which shocked me when I first read it.
He wrote that Clark was preoccupied
with “the little things of the mind.”
I think now there is something in this.
When a series of often spectacular
physical, commercial, or managerial
achievements are discussed in terms of
the quaint theology of the protagonists,
who are made to seem pitiful failures,
I feel like turning to an old school
history, which told the simple story
of how brave pioneers undergoing extra-
ordinary hardship subdued this
wretchedly inhospitable continent.
Failure and theology are fascinating
subjects, but one knows there is more
to life than clerics and politicians.
Those old school-books weren’t as
wrong as all that.
Another consequence of Clark’s
approach is that the forward-lookers—
the men of the Enlightenment and the
Nationalists are always sympathetic-
ally treated. Among the best chapters,
for example, is “The World of Betsy
Bandicoot and Bold Jack Donahue,”
which gives the pre-history of Austra-
lian nationalism. You know, of course,
that their days are numbered, too, and
in due course, like Reformation
Protestantism, they must be eroded by
Clark’s icy irony, but in Volume 2
they are the Coming Age. But what is
to come in the end? Probably Clark’s
slim one-volume “Short History of
Australia” (A Mentor Book) is the
best clue and this may also clear up
one of the paradoxes of Clark’s oeuvre.
The paradox has been that Clark
appears to have had a gloom-and-
failure-sodden view of the Australian
past, while often holding a sort of
simple optimistic “Progressive” view
of our future. In the chapters on con-
temporary history in the “Short His-
tory,” the most sympathetic characters
are those who fight for a New Order
which, while it is not made clear, seems
to have little in common with liberal
or democratic ideas. It certainly means
something which, in the case of less
subtle men, would be labelled Leftist,
although for Clark Leftism is only part
of the pre-history of the Future. In
his “Short History” he shows none of
his otherwise universal sympathy for
those who saw and attacked in the
1940 s and 1950 s the totalitarian threat
to freedom everywhere. The Cold War
anti - totalitarians were for Clark
“hysterical.”
Is then the ground being laid in
Volumes 1 and 2 for Volumes 7 and 8
in which not only Colonial Protestant-
ism but, in their turn, Colonial
Enlightenment and Nationalism be-
come pathetic and ridiculous and the
New Age arrives which was adumbrated
in his book “Meeting Soviet Man”?

“So far there have been four migra-

three Aboriginal and one European.)
So far? Is Clark’s whole massive enter-

he quotes Dostoevsky about wanting

Clark is an exciting historian. He

The epic of saintly Reb Yudel
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Bridal Canopy. S. Y. Agnon.
Gollancz. $4.45.
ONE UNAVOIDABLE byproduct of
otherwise excellent books like “The
Bridal Canopy,” which helped win its
Israeli author the Nobel Prize for
Literature in 1966, is that they serve
to confirm already existing prejudices.
The same could be said of the novels
of Agnon’s American counterpart,
I. B. Singer. Non-Jews tend to imagine,
anyway, that all Jews are strictly
orthodox (which is about the same as
thinking that all Christians are Roman
Catholics), that they all eat kosher, and
that they only very rarely intermarry.
If behind Israel’s new punch is “a
new kind of Jew,” Agnon’s is one of
the oldest kind, the extreme case of
the Eastern Hassid who finds genuine
enjoyment in his adversity and still
lives both by the spirit and the letter
of the Law. His resistance, if any, is
always passive, his afflictions a treasured
mark of his Maker’s Love. His scholar-
ship is confined to the Torah as given
to Moses in the Old Testament and
to its interpretation in the Talmud,
with perhaps the added mysticism of
the Kabbala. Naturally, when Hebrew
and Yiddish writers base profound
books on their religion, they choose
extreme cases, and so the misunder-
standing is perpetuated. Perhaps all
that is missing is an indication that
these are no longer typical of all Jews.
“The Bridal Canopy” starts off in
the best fairytale (and, one suspects,
Kabbalistic) tradition with a poor
virtuous man who has three equally
poor and virtuous daughters whose
marriages-happily-ever-after before the
end of the book are never for one
moment in doubt. This time-worn
theme is merely the beginning of an
intricately woven web of further stories-
within-stories, within still more stories,
which contain something of everything:
not only folklore, fantasy, and fable
but plenty of real-life as well, mixed in
with actual history, the basis of the
beliefs themselves, and, above all, with
the old tradition of dedicated piety. It
is Reb Yudel’s unquestioning faith that
illuminates everything, carrying him
through a series of physical and
spiritual adventures unscathed. Rather
like the legendary saintly “fool,” he
Shmuel Yosef Agnon. .. 1966 Nobel
Prize
is fully piotected by an invisible cloak
of endearing unworldliness.
The Nobel Committee compared the
work with “Don Quixote,” presumably
because of this simple, idealistic hero;
and with Till Eulenspiegel, no doubt
because of its multiplicity of stories
(otherwise, as characters, the two could
scarcely be more dissimilar); while the
English publishers attempt to draw a
parallel with the “Canterbury Tales,”
but here again Chaucer’s raw and ribald
approach is completely missing. In fact
all these comparisons seem as wrong
as they are right, and prove nothing
except that the work does not fit into
any category but must be allotted a
place of its own in world literature.
At the command of the famous Rabbi
of Apta, a true historical figure, Reb
Yudel prises himself loose from his
religious studies, leaves his patient wife,
his three virgin daughters, and Reb
Reveille his rooster, who crows him
awake to prayers every morning, and
sets off in borrowed finery to seek hus-
bands and dowries in order to bring
the three girls under the bridal
canopy. He is to promise to match any
future father-in-law’s offered marriage-
portion in gold, for in due course, The
Blessed Hand will provide.
On the way the citizens are ready
with lodgings, food, and tales for the
traveller especially with the tales
which they use to point up a moral or
to illustrate a line from the Talmud,
and one tale breeds another which then

A member of Option Brokers Association
branches off into logical tangents and
so on, so that finally Reb Yudel seems
to have journeyed even further on
words than on deeds. No suitable
bridegroom having appeared, he gives
up his search, sends home his hired
wagon with its two philosophical horses
and Sancho Panza driver, installs him-
self at the best inn, and quietly sits
and waits.
In no time the matchmakers are at
the door, mistake him for his rich
namesake Reb Yudel Nathanson, and
conclude a contract for his eldest
daughter and the learned son of one of
the finest families in the town. Back
home, the cock Reb Reveille leads the
way to a treasure abandoned in a cave
by fleeing aristocrats, the dowry is
matched according to prophecy, and all
the girls are duly brought under the
canopy. The Lord has provided.
This is only the bare framework on
which much of the wisdom of a
Solomon is lavishly embroidered and
the Jewish religion minutely examined
and interpreted. It is not easy for the
reader to decide exactly when all this is
supposed to take place, but historical
allusions point around 1820. This
allows Reb Yudel to have one foot
firmly in the past and the other pro-
truding slightly into the future,
although he knows nothing of the “en-
lightenment” of Moses Mendelssohn
and German Jewry which had filtered
through into the East at the end of the
18th century. Agnon also refers to the
“false Messiahs” Sabbethai Zevi (who
converted to Islam) and Jacob Frank
(who converted to Catholicism).
As the translator notes, it is the faith
itself which is the entire background
of the book. “The Bridal Canopy” seems
essentially meant as an example of how
unquestioning devotion has so often
delivered the children of Israel through-
out the centuries, enabling them, as a
race, to survive many of their powerful
persecutors. One could, of course, with
almost as much justification, also argue
that Reb Yudel’s fatalistic belief in pre-
destination might equally, in other cir-
cumstances, become, at least in part,
responsible for just as many being wiped
out. This does not prevent his inton-
ation of the 23rd Psalm (“The Lord is
my Shepherd”), after finding a piece
of bread, from being one of the most
moving scenes in the book.
A continuous tinge of gentle irony,
a touch of the absurd, and plain com-
monsense always saves the narrative
from the remotest danger of ever be-
ing cloying, yet it is not really easy to
read, and much perseverance is needed
not to become lost in the labyrinth of
stories. The translation from the
Hebrew has zest rather than subtlety,
and some of the more crazily childish
rhymes and verses are disturbing after
a time. One suspects that while the
overall spirit of the original has been
well maintained some of the detail may
have been obscured in the English.
However, for some inexplicable
reason, probably so as not to frighten
off prospective readers at first glance,
the publishers have printed the
scholarly introduction at the end, be-
hind the glossary, where it can easily
be missed altogether, without even edit-
ing references in the text which refer to
the book to “follow.” This seems an
unnecessary piece of sleight-of-hand
which one would not expect from the
firm of Victor Gollancz.
The alchemist
By MARGARET IRVIN
Elijah’s Ravens. Hal Porter. Angus &
Robertson. $1.95.
THE GHOST of Baudelaire would be
at home in Hal Porter’s poetic terrain.
It might be restless, resentful, but it
would blend. That Porter himself is
so curiously at home in the Antipodes
says a good deal for our “faraway
places.” His new book of poems, “Eli-
jah’s Ravens,” is a guarantee that a
poet may be as decadent, decorative,
and devious as any Gallic symbolist,
and still not be, or feel, alien.
Porter’s is the poetry of disgust,
ornamentation, and, at times, of
baroque remorse and regret. It is mar-
vellous. It has a slant and spread and an
originality that belong to the sinister
nether-side of piquancy. It also has
cathartic value for the reader as well
as for the poet, who has been, now
and then, a rather cruel exploiter of
le petit monde in prose.
In a very strong, highly wrought
poem, “Dry Final Scene,” Porter
writes: ,
The truths of quartz and gold that once
were uttered
Are dust and mist and unremembered
lies.
The light that slides and circles on
the fallows
Now hides in light the dark that is to
be;
My eye that tries these last quicksilver
shallows
And sees their fact sees nothing more
to see ...
I hold the Gorgon’s head, my own, my
own:
It stares this lock-jaw land to light and
stone.
“To The Beloved Born Late,” “To
A Superior Person,” and “The First
Kiss” are poems of genuine anguish;
and “Occupation Ballad,” “Mitzi, the
Viennese Bar-Fly,” and “The Suicide
Farmer,” of genuine pity. Porter has
an Antarctic eye and, occasionally, an
Attic heart.
Pie very often seems to work on
gauze, covering it with an elaborate
frosting, but instead of icing sugar he
uses his own secret ingredient per-
haps an alchemistic acid. It has the
consistency, when dry, of a very refined
plaster of paris. “Lalique,” “Thistles,”
“Sheep,” “Revenante,” and “Goddess
of Goulburn River” are examples of
the use of this technique. “Jack” is so
wonderfully nimble a poem it almost
outstrips itself; and in “Two!”, sodomy
is prettily and pastorally satirised. The
title poem, “Elijah’s Ravens,” is an ap-
praisal of Elizabeth Bowen.
Porter has always been tremendously
entertaining funny, macabre, sad-
istic, sad; and sometimes depressing,
as he is in “The Pregnant Woman” and
“In a Bedsitter.” A few sentences from
Virginia Woolf’s novel “To the Light-
house” come to mind: “He said the
most melancholy things, but she noticed
that directly he had said them he always:
seemed more cheerful than usual. All
this phrase-making was a game, she
thought, for if she had said half what
he said, she would have blown her
brains out by now.”
Porter’s phrase-making is not so
much a game as an artifice. One would
like to say it is more, and offer him
the tribute that his work is “art con-
cealing artifice;” and to say that his:
most savage, rather than melancholy,
conclusions are not a kind of twisted
self-indulgence. But when in the poem,
“Elijah’s Ravens,” he says “You soon
enough find out. Grief brings you low,”
one hears something intrinsic
You soon enough find out. No need
to guess:
Grieve and the world grieves with
you! here herds stop;
the level of their human clumsiness
below the world’s low level cannot
drop . . .
yet this ground-floor’s where sorrow’s
shame grows less.

Risen once too

By RON HOWARD
Phoenix 11. D. H. Lawrence. Edited by
Warren Roberts and Harry T. Moore.
Heinemann. $8.15.
THIS HANDSOMELY produced vol-
ume contains miscellaneous essays and
stories put together for no very good
reason except that they were, presum-
ably, undiscovered or overlooked when
the complete edition of Lawrence’s
wmrk was being compiled.
The most interesting pieces in the
book are an unfinished novel, “Mr.
Noon,” and the long introduction to
Maurice Magnus’ “Memoirs of the
Foreign Legion.” This last, an account
of a particular period in Lawrence’s
life as w'ell as a portrait of Magnus, is
immensely readable. Magnus, a strange
American writer with German royal
blood in his veins, emerges vividly as
a cross between Peter Lorre and Baron
Corvo. Lawrence also beautifully
evokes the setting of the sorry tale as
it shifts from Florence to Taormina,
and from a monastery south of Rome
to the dusty plains of Malta. He him-
self is said to have thought it his finest
piece of writing.
'‘Mr. Noon” is also enjoyable, but it
is beset with two major faults as a
comic novel it is written in a heavily
facetious style with sub-Sterne asides
and dissertations; and it is the victim
of Lawrence’s tendency (derived from
Henry James?) to ride an image until
it collapses beneath him and expires
from utter exhaustion. As this method
is frequently applied to cliche images
the result is even more tiresome than
usual.
Harry T. Moore in his book on Law-
rence suggests that the novel was un-
finished because Lawrence wanted to
publish it as a serial and his agent could
not find a suitable outlet. Virtually no
information is given about it in
“Phoenix II,” and, in general, I felt
that a few' more notes from the editors
would have been very welcome.
Among the other pieces in the book
there is an early version of the begin-
ning of “Women In Love,” and a strik-
ing short story called “The Mortal
Coil,” but the bulk of the volume is
made up of polemical essays which
only the most devoted Lawrence read-
ers will be able to cope wdth.

Turning the first bend. Straighten up.
The first long rush of lane. Your legs
lengthen through pedals, and your feet
are wheels. That body, hunched
in red upholstery, held,
by metal stanchions underneath
flexed and forgetting, here becomes
its curved steel overcoat (the white
enamel shiny under grime; a doorhinge
rusts).
The gauge reassuringly
nails itself to the right. Those circular
bootsoles
have bounce and tread enough
for any trip you choose.

SNOWBOUND
Minutely inspecting the mooncold
white
behind the motel,
I notice a furtive red and yellow
flickering across its slope,
thrown from the foot-high letters on
the entrance, spelling
VACANCY.
The glass on the beige plasterboard wall
films me back-to-front for two days
in phantom 3D color: I remain unself-
conscious.
My tongue licks the filing protruding
from a broken tooth.
I contemplate a crust of ice and a thin
blue shadow
wedged between the window’s parallel
twin panes. I reflect
on the feel of the car’s vinyl and even
my bones, my fingers
releasing and gripping the steering-
wheel
I think of the ice on the bridges, the ice
under the culverts, the New York Thru-
way
“out solid” still (they say), the dead in
their automobiles
discovered by bulldozers and the im-
measurable drift of the snow.
WINTER VISIT IN MAINE
Thankful for the solar pulse
of petrol in the car, for mere
combustion,
I let in the clutch
(feeling warmth still leap from the left-
hand duct)
and shift down to third: the highway
here’s frozen over.
The starless sky is static black.
The backwoods road I follow now
winds by furrowed shelves
which are terraced farms; the snow
in the headlights’ sweep might be
too white to be believed,
but I .\rc the black tissue of the ever-
green
trees textnred in the night, like a web,
and catch the cartilaginous grey
of those stripped trunks and branches
that the wind is shaking.
I’m glad at last to sight Abbott and
Nancy’s barn
and, behind it, the house and the cars of
people I love.
I stumble through thick snow, my face
burning and iced.

The apple
hasn't lost
its lure
EVER SINCE Eve first lured Adam
away from the straight and narrow
with an apple, women have practised
the same fate on the man in their
life.
Apples must be one of the oldest
fruit on this earth, and surely one of the
most abundant. There are hundreds of
varieties of apples, and all make dif-
ferent goodies. Just now, apples arc at
their best. So, if you can tear yourself
away for just "a few weeks from the
good old IXL pulp for making apple
pies, lend, me ycutr ears, and .prepare
to peel . for .-Here..are some.’delectable
things-Torii;iake -with-fresh green apples
■ straight- ffbin tire -tree.
Clctf-auHs sbft of - appl/-.upside-.
down-cake- .which .can be '-eaten either
hot or cold, and" will, in either case,
prove memo.table. As with most fruit
desserts, the arrangement of the fruit
adds'greatly-to the eye-appeal of the
finished dish. With apples, because they
lack color, this is -even more important.
So when making this dessert, mix your
apples-either with a few' grapes, or some
black cherries. And make the pattern
a work of art.
Place 3 tablespoons of -sugar into a
.mixing bowl and break in 4 eggs,, one
by one, stirring well after each addition.
Then stir in 4 tablespoons of flour
with a pinch of salt. Add a small glass
of brandy, and then slowly add 4 cups
of hot milk stirring all the time to
prevent lumps forming.
Butter a round cake tin and line the
bottom with grapes and thick apple
slices. Pour the batter over the fruit,
and hake in a hot oven for 30 minutes.
Add several small pieces of butter from
time to time during cooking. When
cooked, remove from the oven and
sprinkle with castor sugar.
Pudding de Pommes Saint Armel is a
rich version of apple charlotte. Peel,
core, and slice 6 tart apples. Butter a
charlotte mould and line completely
with slices of fresh white bread. Put in
a layer of sliced apples sprinkled with
sugar and cinnamon, dot with butter,
cover with a layer of breadcrumbs, then
another layer of apples, and so on,
until your dish is completely full. Press
down firmly and bake in a slow oven
until cooked. (Test with a knife; when
the apples offer no resistance, the pud-
ding is cooked.) Remove from the
oven, cool for a few minutes, and un-
mould on to a serving plate. Serve
w ith a hot sauce of jam laced w ith rum
• strawberry is very good.
Whole apples baked in pastry with
lashings of freshly whipped cream are
also rather delicious. Use apples that
are just ripe. Peel and core them and
fill up the cavities with a mixture of
candied fruit and honey. Sprinkle the
apples with a little lemon juice and
then sit them on a square of pastry
large enough to envelope each apple.
Cut a few leaves out of the pastry,
marking the veins of the leaves with a
knife, and attach to the tops of each
apple case with a little beaten egg-
yolk mixed with water. Brush this mix-
ture over the entire apple cases and
place on a buttered baking sheet and
bake in a moderate oven for about 30
minutes.
The Scandinavians make a baked
apple which is also very delicious pro-
vided you like the flavor of almonds
which, personally, I adore. At the
local health store you purchase \ cup
of ground almonds and mix it at home
with j cup sugar and 2 tablespoons of
water. This paste is filled into the peeled
and cored apples.
The apples are then rolled in melted
'butter and a mixture of Breadcrumbs
. and sugar, and placed into a ‘buttered
baking disk and sat in a hot .oven
for 2-5 minutes; ’ By -which
time they should be soft and "’-nicely
brow ned. For decorative purposes .only,
I tend to spike the apples with a few
slivers of whole almonds so that they
look like puffed-up porcupines. But
these spikes are only pierced into the
apples about halfway through the-cook-
ing time, otherwise they get too brown-
during the cooking period.
Apples go well with spices that add
to their flavor. Rosemary Hemphill,
in her "‘Penguin Book of Herbs, and
Spices,” gives the recipe for a simple
family apple pudding which we like
very much with plenty of whipped
cream.
Peel, slice, and core enough cooking
apples to cover the bottom of a but-
tered baking dish thickly; add 4 or 5
whole cloves and 2 tablespoons of seed-
less raisins, sprinkle with lemon juice,
and strew with sugar. Pour over this a
batter made with 2 cups plain flour, a
pinch of salt, \ cup of sugar, 2 eggs, and
1 pint of milk. Bake in a moderate oven
for 1 hour.
A more adventurous use of spice w ith
apples is her suggestion for a Coriander
Apple Crumble. Cover the bottom of a
shallow ovenproof dish with peeled,
sliced, and cored apples. Sprinkle with
1 tablespoon of brown sugar and 1 tea-
spoon ground cinnamon. In a bow l, rub
together until crumbly 1 cup plain
flour, I cup brown sugar, and Jib. but-
ter. Press and smooth this on top of
the apples, and sprinkle with crushed
coriander seed. Bake in a moderate
oven for 30 minutes, and eat either hot
or cold with dollops of cream.


LETTERS
Art and aesthetics
In answer to Mr. Brook’s letter
(8., March 16), I should say that while
I think works of art have their own
aesthetic “impact,” quite irrespective
of our concepts, I don’t think anyone
can rid himself of his “notion of what
a work of art should be” when he faces
what might be a work of art, but surely
it is clear enough that preconceptions
may hinder as well as help the revela-
tion of aesthetic qualities; the history
of criticism is pretty much about the
inadequacy of canons to deal with the
new or recently discovered.
What I was suggesting earlier was
not that discussion of terms necessarily
inhibits observation of works of art,
but that, at present, a preoccupation
with concepts, sometimes used as con-
cepts of validity, was leading many
critics to see the work of art, if they
say it at all, only as an occasion for
testing theories.
While I agree with Mr. Brook that
theories must be tested against new
works and against the works from which
the theories were derived, I don’t think
that this has anything to do with the
work’s being a work of art, for I think
that aesthetic qualities reside in the
work itself, that, in fact, to use Dr.
Brook’s words, “objects come with in-
structions about their nature and
function(?) written on their faces.”
Their natures are not written any-
where else and are not constituted by
any theories the observer may have;
our first observation of beauty was
made without a set of canons, which,
of necessity, would have to be based
on the observation of many works of
art.
Theories about works of art, more
numerous in these times, as Dr. Brook
says, tend to make some observers
too many, is my complaint ignore
the work of art as a unique object. This
is connected with a central problem in
modern aesthetics: since every work
of art is unique how can aesthetic
generalisations be made about them?
Generalisation has become so preva-
lent that I feel like advocating lessons
in “appreciation” of the picture of
the month. To generalise generalisa-
tions are pretty inescapable, but in
art criticism, as is increasingly the case
in literary criticism, they might more
profitably refer to specific works.

Expecting too much of
New Guinea
The “Black and White” article re-
ferred to (8., March 2) by Professor
Inglis and “Observer” appeared in
August last year. If either had bothered
reading it with an unclouded mind,
he would have seen that the whole point
made was this:
Education at the primary level is
being neglected for the sake of produc-
ing a handful of academics. The figure
quoted was that fewer than 60 per-
cent of children of school-going age in
the Territory are attending school. This
was a conservative figure. It is probably
fewer than 40 percent.
It is difficult to see how this point
of view represents, to quote “Observer,”
“last ditch prejudices toward change of
any kind that is still to be found among
some Australians in New Guinea.” The
publishers of “Black and White” would
like to see changes, especially in the
approach to education. At the rate pro-
gress is being made to provide basic
education for the native at village level,
and the rate the university wants to
churn out graduates, it won’t be long
before the University of Papua-New
Guinea will be rented out to some other
country. There won’t be any more
literate natives to fill the gaps left by
graduates.
To lend further weight to his argu-
ment, “Observer” said “Black and
White’s” prejudices are too catholic
to be limited to universities. For in-
stance, it recently made this comment
on the present elections for the House
of Assembly: “after the next elections
elected membership of the House will
be increased meaning that there
will be more morons doing their best
to bugger-up the country.”.
“Black and White” didn’t mention
Papuans and New Guineans. During
the last session of the House there were
enough morons among European mem-
bers to provide copy, without having
to poke about too much among the
native members!
Sure, the native population comes
under fire from us. But so does the
European population, from the club-
going seven-days-a-week-boozer, to the
affected social-climber who would be
lucky to get a ditch-digging job if he
were back in Australia. And so does the
hardcore of “845,” the expatriates who
have been here for 30 years and dwell
on the good old days when kanaka bash-
ing was a favorite sport and any bum
was “masta” just because his skin was
white.
The magazine is owned and published
by two men one of them aged 26,
the other aged 32. Both are literate.
One is Polish, the other British born.
During the past 15 months, since the
inception of “Black and White,” these
two men have been trying to get a
laugh out of Papua-New Guinea.

Point misunderstood
I regret troubling you twice in so short
a space of time, but feel that I have
some right of reply to an unfair charge.
Mr. Lynn’s critique (8., March 16)
attributed to me a claim of aesthetic
infallibility, on behalf of Mr. Gordon
Thomson, the buyer of the first Power
art acquisitions; and he quoted a few
words of mine that seemed to support
him.
It appears that he cannot have under-
stood my point, since the choice of
quotation and the inference drawn can
otherwise only have been maliciously
motivated.
My argument, clearly set out in the
“Sydney Morning Herald” (Feb. 27),
was the very contrary of an infallibility
claim. I wrote that within the limits
and purposes of the Power fund it
would not be easy for anyone to sustain
a case that he could have done better
than Mr. Thomson. This conclusion
turned on the premise that when deal-
ing with thoroughly novel forms,
nobody speaks with authority about
what is most excellent. It is because
of fallibility, so close to the edge of
the new, and not of infallibility, that
I believe every lively and independent-
minded buyer would bring home a dif-
ferent collection. And while each one
would hope to have his personal verdicts
endorsed by the rest of us in time, he
would be on firmer ground arguing
now about what is representative in
his bag than about what is excellent.
Mr. Lynn concedes: “All are good
pedagogical pieces as they allow you
to raise issues . . .”; but he only really
admires a handful. Can he be certain
that, had their roles been reversed, Mr.
Thomson’s judgment must have been
more generous?

Do you know?
For some time I have been researching
the circumstances of the Victorian
police strike, which commenced in
November, 1923. To complete this
research, I would be extremely pleased
to hear from any of your readers who
have recollections of this event. I am
interested in any recollection whatso-
ever, but I am particularly interested
in contacting anyone with knowledge
of the major participants.

I am in the final stages of a book on
the life and alleged influence of the
late Mr. John Wren. I am more con-
cerned with the political and social
aspects of his career than with his
financial operations, and I would be
pleased to hear from any of your
readers who believe they have some
information or opinions of value to me.
Naturally, confidences will be respected.
Within limits I can call on anyone
who finds it unsatisfactory to write.
