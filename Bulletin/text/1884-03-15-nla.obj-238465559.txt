Jurors and Judges.
Between the theoretical conception of Trial
by Jury as grandiloquently defined in con-
stitutional law-books, and Trial by Jury in
practical operation in New South Wales—
between the phrase and the fact, the word
and the thing—there is in reality an exceed-
ing great gulf fixed. In the constitutional
law-books, as in the language of those gush-
ing young fools, who, in the debating class,
take a Sapsban view of things, Trial by Jury
is the Palladium of Britain, the bulwark of
English liberty, “ the noblest invention for
the support of justice ever produced
while, as for the position and status of the
juror, it is said to be one of peculiar dignity.
He is a judge of the facts. To assault him,
even to threaten him, is a high misde-
meanour and gross contempt of court. The
verdict that he and bis mates deliver is un-
controllable ; and though it be apparently
contrary to the evidence, or to the direction
of the presiding Judge, they are not in any
way punishable for it. He is to have no
other rule than the belief which results to
his individual mind from the facts alleged
on both sides before him, from their proba-
bility, from the credibility of the witnesses,
and even from all such circumstances as he
may have a private knowledge of. Moreover,
he and his colleagues are presumed to re-
present the worth and common sense of the
community.
* * *
But, in the actual procedure of our Courts
of Law, what do we find Trial by Jury to
be ? A Palladium ?—or a wooden horse ?—or
a something betwixt and between?—a bul-
wark of liberty, or a shield of brawn ?—“ the
noblest invention,” &c., or a scurvy mockery?
Do w© find the juror treated as in any sense
the equal of the Judge, or as ihe Judge’s
chattel, liable to downright bad usage if by
misadventure His Honor’s temper hath been
stroked the wrong way ? Do we, as a rule,
find the Jury representative of the worth
and common-sense of the community ? Why
should we trouble to reply to these queries ?
Is it not a fact that Trial by Jury in New
South Wales., is fast becoming a laughing-
stock? Is it not a fact that ill-bred and ill-
taught Judges have grossly insulted, not
only individual jurors, but whole juries, for
venturing to act upon the principle thus laid
down by Hale: “In their recess, the jury
are to consider the evidence, to weigh the
credibility of the witnesses, and the force
and efficacy of their testimonies; wherein
they are not precisely bound by the rules of
the Civil law, viz., to have two witnesses to
prove every fact, nor to reject one witness
because he is single, or always to believe
two witnesses, if the probability of the fact
does upon other circumstances reasonably
encounter them: for the trial is not here
simply by witnesses, but by jury— nay, it
may so fall out that a jury, upon their own
knowledge, may know a thing to be false
that a witness swore to be true, or may
know a witness to be incompetent or in-
credible, though nothing be objected against
him— and may give their verdict accord-
ingly?” is it not a fact that the body of
jurors from whom the pauels are struck
cannot honestly be deemed representa-
tive of the worth and common-sense
of the community, mainly on these two
accounts; (1) that the jury list is very
imperfectly made, the names of many quali-
fied persons being left out, virtually at the
discretion of the police, who, in numberless
cases, stretch that discretion under pretence
°f excluding persons whom they consider
favourers of crime, on account of their con-
nection with convicted prisoners; (3) that
well-to-do persons, naturally disliking the
unnecessary inconvenience and discomfort
of the “box,” as well as reasonably dread-
ing the risk of being “ Judas Iscarioted,”
snorted at, or otherwise, more or less,
brutally insulted by vulgar, bumptious
J udges, prefer rather to p ay a fine than to at-
tend when summoned? Can, then, ihe resi-
duum who answer to their names, be deemed
truly representative of the worth and com-
mon sense ot the community ? Here, again, we
need not to reply—the answers being so
evident.
* * ♦
The jury of twelve ought to contain (and
would do so, were the jury-lists more fre-
quently made out, and were those sum-
moned subjected, on attendance, to better
treatment) a sprinkling of members of all
the law-abiding classes, fairly representative
of the several interests of the respectable
population—the intellectually superior ele-
ments naturally exercising a leavening
influence. In theory, the right ot challenge
is extended to the prisoner, on the principle
that since his fate entirely depends on the
twelve men who compose the jury, he should
have a share in the choice of them. This
surely implies that the list from which the
selection must be made shall be a broadly
representative one. If the list be restricted,
either by imperfect collection in the first in-
stance, or by the subsequent evasion of well-
to-ao persons who have been summoned, his
interests are without doubt seriously endam-
aged, The result of the jury lists being so
restricted is to give the nightman far too
great a “show.” If the institution of Trial
by Jury is to be continued with any hope
of retaining the confidence of the people, it
must be reformed. At present it certainly
seems as though it were the object of the
legal authorities —of Judges, official prose-
cutors, and sheriff—to degrade it in the eyes
of all men. Unless, indeed, such be their
object, their conduct with regard to it is in-
explicable. In everything that concerns the
relations of Judges and barristers the mutual
etiquette is exigeant, though in Court the
latter (despite their rights of audience) are
subordinate to the former. In everything
that regards the relations of Judge to juror
—the latter being temporarily the former’s
equal in rank, his assessor-colleague, in no
sense his subordinate—the “ mutuality is all
on one side ” —not the juror’s side. It is here
the reform should begin. We believe that
the institution of Trial by Jury, once rea-
sonably reformed, would be likely to prove
serviceable for years to come, if not precisely
as a Palladium, at least as a substantial pro-
tection against legal hardness, strained judi-
cial interpretations, and prejudiced prose-
cutions.
♦ * *
The juror requires to be treated with more
respect. His remuneration should be higher.
The salaries of the Judges are handsome, and
their allowances for travelling, &c., liberal.
So should be those of their colleagues. The
quasi-peual treatment to which the juror is
now subject—the locking-up, the food-
docking, the directing him not to listen to
this or to read that—must be abolished.
Then, again, since the main object of Trial
by Jury is “to guard accused persons against
all decisions whatever from men invested
with permanent official authority,” it must
be so ordered that the deliverance of the
jury shall henceforth be a verdict strictly
“uncontrollable” and not
for a single moment to be questioned or
officially criticised by the Judge. “Not
Proven ” might advantageously be added to
the two forms of verdict which alone jurors
can now deliver. And verdicts, instead of
having to be unanimous, should be by
majority, either by bare majority as in
Scotland and the Channel Islands, or by
two-thirds majority as in France. Last, but
by no means least, the collection of the jury
lists should either be entrusted to other
agency than that of the police, or (if for
convenience it be continued in their hands)
subjected to a rigid scrutiny by some special
tribunal of an elective character—the
magisterial benches being not sufficiently
independent of Government control, besides
being too lib with the police authorities.
Some such reforms as these would probably
secure to Trial by Jury a large measure of
its theoretical importance, by popularising
it afresh. Its present hold on popular
favour is not only weak, but daily weaken-
ing more and more.
The Premier of Queensland seems deter-
mined to leave a name in history. Mr.
Griffith is leader of the party in the
Northern colony which styles itself “Li-
beral.” As though to testify in how slight
a degree classifications of that nominal sort
represent the true spirit oi the men who
employ them, Mr. Griffith, the liberal, has
scarcely settled himself into his own seat,
and his distinguished friend Mr. Groom into
the place of honour in the Assembly, than
he puts into practice a device for crushing
an opposing newspaper—a device worthy of
Lord North, and, in reality, borrowed from
the era in British domestic history which
witnessed Defoe in the pillory, and Dr.
Woolcot (Peter Pindar) skulking to escape
a Government prosecution. If the gratuit-
ous insult flung upon all Queensland by the
selection of the fellow Groom to fill the
position of “ first gentleman ” in that colony
should not suffice to stamp Mr. Griffith’s
present tenure of power with ignominy, his
revival of obsolete and justly infamous pro-
cedures, discarded from British tactics since
regal and oligarchical power has been con-
trolled and curbed by successive political re-
forms, would serve to disfigure the record.
In our own colony, the usefulness of the
Press as a protector of the public-against
political, commercial, and social imposto:«
has been dangerously crippled by the ipsc-
dixit of a Chief Justice who appears de-
sirous of brooking no rival near his throne .
but as yet the public security and popular
freedom have not been assailed by the pro-
digious political iniquity which Mr. Griffith
has inaugurated in the neighbouring colony,

If the remarks and comments of the
Courier— the leading journal of Queensland
—were characterised by any abnormal fero-
city or coarseness, or by any unprecedented
unscrupulousness of allegation, there would
have been slight occasion for surprise had
the angry Premier retorted by exceptional
proceedings. But, as a matter of fact, there
is nothing singular or exceptional in the
Courier’s comments. The article stated
that two members of the minority in the
Committee for Elections and Qualifications
were so disconcerted that they had sent in
their resignations, and one had since stated
in the Assembly his conviction of the hope-
less|partiality ofjthe Committee—their deci-
sion being governed, not at all by evidence,
but wholly by party considerations. Fur-
ther, it was alleged in the article that “it is
understood that the Election Committee,
which merely executes the Premier’s will,

Bias determined to quash ’’—another election
mot yet actually dealt with. This may very
well be true. But it would be hard to prove.
Many true things are hard to prove.
Imagine Junius called upon to prove to the
satisfaction of a law court, all his charges
against the administration of his day! But
true or false matters little as to the political
morality of the Queensland sham Liberal’s
revenge. Any journal could be forced to
choose between prudential silence and ruin
by prosecutions such as Mr. Griffith
has set in motion against the Courier.
Everyone knows that it is not the mere ver-
dict which a litigant cares about, now-a-
days. A man may be ruined by successful
litigation. A bill of costs as between lawyer
and client is a tremendous instrument of
destruction. And when the purse of the
community is pitted against the pocket of
private individuals, there’s no doubt about
the ultimate result. Mr. Liberal Griffith
has degraded the name of Liberal once
again.
PLAINS ENGLISH.
Sauce for the Geese.
The “loyal” Orangemen of Jamberoo, in
solemn conclave assembled, have unanimously re-
solved that they are “ of opinion that the question
of Scriptural instruction in Public Schools wil 1
never bo placed on a satisfactory footing until the
Bible itself is read daily in every Public School in
the colony—subject, of course, to the proviso that
no child shall be compelled to join in Bible lessons
if its parents object.” If the view of these Orange
Jamboroos be accepted by the Minister of Public
Instruction (which we don’t for a moment suppose
it will), how will he be able to resist consistently
the equally legitimate and reasonable contention
(should it be made) that Tom Paine’s “ Age of
Reason,” or Mrs. Besant’s “ My Path to Atheism,”
be read daily in every Public School in the colony,
subject, of course, to the proviso that no child
|hall be compelled to join in the Frcethought
essonsif its parents object. The complete secu-
larisation of the Public Schools must be urged on,
notwithstanding the shrieks of the Presbyterian
and similar organs of sectarian bigotry. If the
Orange Jamberoos want Orange Jamberooism
taught, let them at their own cost provide teachers
and buildings for the said proselytising process'
The Roman Catholics act consistently in this
matter. They stigmatise the Public School system
as godless, and go to work as if they believed it
was so. Let the Orange Jamboroos be only equally
honest, and we won’t care if they support a teacher
in every parish. But they must keep their hands
off the non-sectarian organisation of the Public
School system.
Larks for Larrikins.
One factor of the larrikinism now so
prevalent is undoubtedly the lack of wholesome
recreation for the lower orders in the larger centres
of population. An absurd Puritanism is answer-
able for this. No social reform will ever reach the
larrikin strata, unless it be a reform divorced en-
tirely from the Puritan spirit. The “ move on ”
gospel will not effect a cure ; neither will the
gospel of the Young Men’s or Young Women’s
Christian Associations, nor that of the City Mis-
sionary. The means of wholesome recreation, not
only in the' shape of parks, but in that of music"
halls and dancing-saloons, must be bountifully
purveyed to the lower orders if larrikinism is ever
to be put down. Puritanism can’t see this. Even
a man like John Osborne, who professes to be
“ broad,” sees in coercive legislation the only means
of battling with the larrikin. “ I would put down
dancing-saloons,” says he. We would put them
up. “ It seems a distinct pity that youthful spirits
should be repressed or turned into a sour and
morbid channel through a mistaken notion of the
vice and folly of dancing.” Thus Lady Grevllle,
in an able paper on “ Social Reform for the
London Poor ” (in the January number of the
Fortnightly). We agree with Lady Grevllle.
“ Father ” Mackonochie’s Church Dancing Saloon
was a really grand idea, though evangelical bigots
hounded him down tor thus (as they yelled) pander-
ing to Belial. A well-conducted concert-hall and
dancing-saloon, where propriety was insisted on
and where cheap refreshments could be procured,
in every parish of the metropolis would be the
focus of a moral improvement subtle as leaven in I
its operation. Life wants making brighter. The
Puritan would make it duller. With more bright-
ness would come more refinement. There’s no-
thing like hearty, jolly, amusement to brighten
life; and, perhaps, no amusement so re-invigorat-
ing as dancing. Well did that honest and truly
** broad ” thinker. Norman Macleod, recognise this
when he sang those stirring stanzas—
“ Dance, my children, lads and lasses,
Cut and shuttle, toes and heels;
Piper, roar from every chanter
Hurricanes of Highland reels I
Make the old place shake with laughter,
Beat its flooring like a drum,
Batter it with Tullochgorum
Till the storm without is dumb!
Sweep in cycles like a whirlwind,
Flit across like meteors glancing,
Crack your fingers, shout in gladness—
Think of nothing but of dancing!”
Mr. Norman Selfe, M I.C.E., M.I.M.E., &c.
Mr. Norman Selfe, whoso portrait appears in
our issue this week, is probably better known in
connection with colonial engineering than any
other engineer in Sydney, and, indeed, in the
whole colony—if we except the three professional
beads of the Government engineering depart-
ments. Mr. Selfe comes from a race of practical
people. His father and grandfather both gave
evidence on the Parliamentary Committee on the
London Water Supply; and in leaving for this
colony in 1854, his father gave up a business which
had been carried on by his ancestors at Kingston-
on-Thames for at least 300 years—the old vellum-
covered account books being preserved in the
counting-house. A rain water-head of most
elaborate design, made for the ancestors of the
Duke of Norfolk in 1677, was brought back
to the works nearly 300 years after, in perfect pre-
servation, and was exhibited at a meeting of the
Surrey Archaeological Society, shortly before the
subject of our notice left England. Mr. Norman
Selfe was educated specially for an engineer,
partly in his native town, and afterwards at St.
Margaret’s, in Kent. Arriving here, he was ap-
prenticed to Messrs. P. N. Russell and Co., in whose
service he rose, by the sheer force of talent and
Industry to the very highest position, the Arm then
being the principal engineering firm in Australia.
Some thousands of designs for steam engines and
mill plans passed through his hands. Afterwards,
Mr. Selfe became the engineer for the Australian
Mineral Oil Company, and for the Western Kero-
sene Company, designing and carrying out for the
former the works at North Shore, and for the latter
the great refining works at Botany. His railway
designs at the Hartley Vale works brought him
the highest encomiums. Subsequently Mr. Selfe
erected the extensive works of the Sydney Gas
Company, Miller’s Point. He now accepted an
offer from Mort’s Dock and Engineering Company
—in the first instance to design the mail steamer
Governor Blackall, and he was afterwards ap-
pointed scientific engineer and chief draughtsman
to the company. Mr. Selfe’s success with this
company received signal recognition from the
leading English engineering works, costly illustra-
tions of many of his designs appearing in these pub-
lications—notably the Crown-street pumping en-
[ gines and the compound engines of the Bell-bird
said to be the first compound launch engines made
anywhere). The improved plan now adopted
for the berthing of ships at the Circular
Quay is undoubtedly an unrecognized adop-
tion of the scheme proposed by Mr. Selfe
a few years ago. The plan now adopted
saves the country at least £100,000. Very important
wharfage work has been erected by Mr. Selfe for
private firms ; he has likewise been the designer
of the Government torpedo boats (eighteen miles
an hour), the patent slips, the great cranes at
Darling Harbour, the new harbour steamer and
the more important sugar works of the colony.
In 1880, Mr. Selfe was elected a full member of
the Institution of Civil Engineers, and also of the
Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He was one
of the founders of the Engineering Association of
N.S.W., and was three years President. He was
likewise one of the founders of our prosperous
Technical College. Besides all this individual
work, some of the most promising young engineers
have passed under his training. In 1873, Mr. Selfe
married the eldest daughter of Mr. John Booth, of
Balmain. It Is quite impossible to refer in detail
to even the principal works designed by Mr. Selfe.
Nearly every warehouse or factory in Sydney
owes something to his great skill and industry,
and no man in the country more thoroughly
deserves the spell which he now proposes to give
himself in his intended trip to England.

“ Port. Macquarie You say surveyors are

bo a gas company at Milparinka, or a social purity
society at Cooper’s Creek, we could understand it.

to us when wo were editing a Queensland country
paoer, and tried to coax a free ad. An unmlstake-
able quack, that one. Some of these quacks know
as much of the special complaints they undertake
to treat as the qualified doctors know. But some
know nothing, except that mankind is gullible,
and almost all are apt to turn the knowledge they
get of delicate matters to their own advantage by
blackmailing their patients. You have always more
security for proper treatment from a regular prac-
titioner, and you are sure of confidence being re-
spected. .“Dicky Sam” (Newcastle): The expression

By way of consoling Mr. Larrikin Brown,
who was recently flogged In Bathurst, a local
editor bids him remember that “although his
punishment was great, that of the Son of God was
greater.” That certainly ought to take the sting
out of the cat’s claws a trifle; but feeling in a more
than ordinary Scriptural humour just then, the
charitable scribe continuesChrist was charged
by the Jews as being an imposter, liar, &o., and
was taken before that inconsistent crawler of
a police magistrate, Pilate, who, after examining
the accused, said, ‘ I And no fault in this Man
Yet Pilate smote Him, and banded Him over to
the mob to be crucified. There was a hot sardine
of a police magistrate for you.” We venture to
think that the likening of the Roman Governor to
a hot sardine has never been equal ed for poetic
beauty even by Capting Canty or the honorable
member for the Horsewhip Bend, and that the
idea of drawing a parallel between a dirty, un-
natural blackguard and the noblest moralist and
social reformer who ever suffered from the con-
servative malice of orthodox bigots, is one of the
most infamous ever conceived.
Booth, the temperance man, made a
■ convert ” last week, and one too rejoicing in the
rather Intoxicating name of John Collins. John
was charged at the Melbourne City Court, with
drunkenness,and as it was onlyabout his hundredth
appearance, he pleaded hard for “ one more
etiance.” Mr. Call (who is almost womanly in his
gentleness) gave him the option of joining the
Blue Ribbon Army, and honest John journeyed
forth from the Court House, took the oath of
allegiance, and returned to the “teak,” with the
pit of blue in irs coat and tears of gratitude in
his eyes, to thank him for his leniency. It is
worthy of remark, mind you, that Mr. Call
(questioned John as to whether he had partaken of
just one on his way back, and points to the
fact that he was sceptical of John’s stability of
cbaractar. And when we mention that the two
old mends had another meeting—under the
usual melancholy circumstances — within three
days of John s“ conversion,” it shows that Mr. Call
is a clever judge-of humanity. Still it is satisfac-
tory to know that the name of John ColJios will
bo included in the list of Mr. Booth’s converts for
the year.
Political Points
The Age declares that the fate of Mr.
Dibbs’ property-tax proposal is the clearest and
most convincing' proof of the grasping greed of
the N S.W. Conservatives, and of the folly and
supineness of the Liberals in that community.
In view of the great interest which at-
taches to the vacant portfolio, we are happy to be
in a position to announce, by authority, that Mr.
John Davies, C.M.G., will be appointed Minister
for Education when the month J-a-n-a-r-y comes
round.
Sir Robert Bright, over whose head
Connaught was appointee to the command of the
Meerut division of the Bengal Army, has been
given a “ distinguished service ” reward of £100 a
year. Bright probably thinks that were the
Army authorities just before they were generous,
it would be all the better.
Arthur Wellesley Peel, M.P. for Warwick,
was elected Speaker of the House of Commons, on
the 30th ult., without opposition. The moderate
Conservatives refused to countenance the putting
forward of a rival candidate out of fear lest a
contest should so exasperate party feeling as to
destroy all prospect of future occupants of the
chair being considered the “ mouth ” and oracle of
the whole assembly.
For a new way of writing about an election
Alfred is unrivalled. Wo note with admiration,
on polling-day, this brilliant flight“ From an
early hour the supporters of each candidate were
busily canvassing the electorate.” Also this in-
vlgoratingly original period:—“ Of the chances of
the respective candidates there were, of course,

gage a “sandwich” advertising-man now-a-days.

It would be interesting to learn from old
Luscombe what was the meaning of that confer-
ence which his confederates held with Sydney Bur-
dokin just prior to the nominations for East Sydney.
Did his patriotism overcome his ambition ? Did his
courage ooze out at his fingers’ ends at the last
moment. In fact, was it patriotism or what,
which induced him to clear the path, so that
Sydney might win East Sydney We suspect it
was—what?
i Among the public works to be omitted
from the revised estimates, the item appears,
“Tanks and wells to be reduced from £00,000 to
£30,000.” This is leaving well alone with a ven-
geance. By the bye, we learn from the Wilcannia
Times, that a tank 15ft. deep and otherwise of fair
dimensions, has been constructed at the Dry Lake
in such a high position that no water can get into
it. For such Mining Department mercies it is
difficult to feel thankful.
“If Friday be given up, private members
would be relinquishing some of their most sacred

And that for the last twenty years during which
Mr. Buchanan had been a member of the House he
had seldom failed to be absent from a division on
a Friday night.” Thus Abbott, proving the rant
of the learned member for Mudgee to be nothing
at all but absolute fudgee.
Henceforth the Lords-Lieutenant of
Ireland, on their arrival and departure from
Kingston, are to honoured with a full Royal in lieu
of a Vice-regal salute. Surely this truly Liberal
measure (of gunpowder) ought to satisfy Erin;
and yet we fear that like many another similar idea,
it will end in smoke. Perhaps this arrangement is
preliminary to the development of a little court
job now hatching, viz. the appointment of Lorne-
cum-Louise to the Lodge in the “ Phaynix.”
The Radical section of the Gladstone ad-
ministration has triumphed 1 The County Fran-
chise Bill, providing for a uniform qualification in
England, Scotland and Ireland, has been introduced
in the Commons by the Premier; while it is not
intended to deal with seats redistribution till next
year. The Whigs, like the Tories, were for put-
ting the cart before the horse—redistribution first
and reform of franchise afterwards; but Chamber-
lain, Dilke, and Co. have been too many for them.
A contemporary observes : — “ Canada’s
national debt is, in proportion to the population
higher than that of any other country, and is
rapidly growing.” This is inaccurate. The debt
of Canada is 33 millions to a population of 4V,
millions, or something like £7 per head. The
debt of Cape Colony is 15 millions to a population
of 1)4 million, or £13 per head. The gross public
debt of the British possessions in Australasia is
98 millions to a population of say 3 millions, or
nearly £33 per head.
Sir James Martin urges the re-enactment
of his Workhouse Act of ’66, which, through the
neglect of Parkes, his then colleague, was never
carried out. He asserts that its operation will
prevent much misery to hundreds of drunken and
dissipated persons, unable and umvilling to help
themselves, and leave the police some time to
attend to matters of greater utility than picking
up drunkards and vagrants from the gutters.
Perhaps; but the term workhouse is decidedly
objectionable.
Hiep-hoa, late King of Annam, was more
than four hours dying. The poison nearly failed.
Advantage was taken of this to make him sign an
act of abdication, in which he declared himself
incapable of ruling, and unworthy to live, that is
why he dies. Before his death, he used his last
hours to abdicate in favour of his well-beloved
Tai-phu (the new King). When the Regent of

other day with Iv.Tricou, he accepted and went

estates never had any right of possession or con-
tinuity of tenure—that they are, in fact, tres-
passers on his God-given rights. As for the
abstract rights of man, or the particular rights of
a crofter in actual occupancy of a holding to live
and not perish of sheer starvation, these are
matters which His Grace treats as trifles light as
air. His land is not to be trespassed on. Sic wit.
slcjuiet. Well, we shall see.
The India Office, without the knowledge
of the local Government of India, some little white
ago granted a concession to a coal company, by
the terms of which they are virtually invei d
with sovereign rights over the harbour of Pemn
Island aud the adjacent shore. Now that war is
imminent, the folly of having made such a con-
cession is evident. Perim, a place naturally of no
strategical value, could be evacuated at a moment’s
notice but for its being a coal depot. Should hos-
tilities break out, either tho coal must be burnt
(when the company, Lucas-like, will want com-
pensation), or the harbour fortified. Ripon has
protested against the absurd action of the' Indian
Office in the most peremptory manner, to Kimber-
ley’s huge disgust.
Standing Order No. 100 of the Legislative
Council contains these words: “The prayer of
evsry petition must be at the end thereof.” Stand-
ing Order No. 19 of the Legislative Assembly is
somewhat similar: “ Every p itition must contain
the prayer of petitioners at the end thereof - ”
When a petition to either branch of the Legisla-
ture clearly states its object in respectful terms,
why on earth should it be deemed necessary, now-
s'days, that it must conclude with the lie, “and
your petitioners will ever pray ?” There’s a lot of
dry-rotting precedent that -Wants being cut out
of our parliamentary procedure.
The Radicals who howled with delight
over the Grand Old Man's “pamphlet” on the
“atrocities” of the Bashi-Bazouks, mustbestag-
ferod by the intelligence that Lieutenant-Colonel
tewart is now leading a force of 2000 of those
troops in Egypt. Things must certainly have
changed since “ seventy-six;” but it is to be hoped
that the English Conservative party will not worry
the grand old gentleman, now he’s enjoying the
sweets of office, with references to the “ Mid-
lothian campaign” and “Opposition” orations.
Of course, he didn’t know, then, that he’d ever
want Bashi-Bazouks on his side.
The Victorian Railway Commissioners are
looking into things, and now and again lift up
a little matter, venerable with the dust of anti-
quity, mb the dust off it. and knock it down with
their wand. The other day they found a by-law
which empowered all officials with screws over
£400 per annum to ride round the colony without
purchasing a railway ticket. The by-law was a
relic which the colony didn't seem to have ex-
amined very minutely in the past, but which the
white-wnsted officials prized as a sacred privilege.
The commissioners held it up for a while, gave it a
lick of their wand, and, lol its foolishness and in-
justice were scattered to the winds. The officials
were horrifled, but the people laughed.
On the 8th January, 1885, Prince Albert
Victor of Wales will come of age. Of course, a
separate establishment is already being talked
about for His Royal Highness; and we may be
equally certain that the bitter outcry which is
sure to be raised against a definite proposal of the
kind will be set down to Communistic ruffians
consumed with the burning desire to destrov
England’s greatness. Inasmuch as the annuities
at present payable to tne Royal Family (exclusive
of such “ perks ” as full colonelcies, naval or mili-
tary commands, rangerships, travelling expenses,
&c., &c., &c., &o.,) tot up to £556,000, we think that
his relations might club up enough between them
to prevent the poor lad going on the parish.
The Pavoriten Quarter of Vicuna is princi-
pally inhabited by working men who have a
a shrewd knowledge of the way in which poverty
demoralises their class; when, therefore, one Sun-
day in January a Jesuit missionary in the local
church of St John sought to impress on them the
“Glory of Poverty,” they would hive none of
his making the damnable appear the blessed. “ We
will have no Jesuits ! ” they cried, and with some
roughness they hunted him out of the pulpit. In
the panic which ensued, several persons were hurt.
When priests preach the Gospel of Discontent, and
the glory of a social transformation which shall
ameliorate things for the poor here on this side
the blue, then perchance they may win the ears
of the toiling millions—but not till then.
Says the courtly Whitehall Review
“Our social system has its evil features, and
poverty is not unknown among us (considering
that England has 803,719, Ireland 463,646 and
Scotland 93,618 absolute paupers the W.R’s‘not
unknown ’ is hardly ingenuous), but on the whole
our people have a general interest in maintaining
the institution of property on its present basis.”
If by “ our people ” the W. R. means its special
clientele, we dare say it speaks God Almighty’s
truth; but—and’tis a but of big import—we are
confident that outside of that “whole,” the mil-
lions in the United Kingdom are for such a whole-
sale agrarian reform as will Irrecoverably shatter
the present basis of property, and substitute for it
something that shall at least possess a semblance
of equity.
The South Australian Licensed Vic-
tuallers Gazette, is, as might be expected, in-
tensely and densely Podsnappish. “ Instead of
conferring titles (acknowledging the Mahdi’s right
to assume the title of ‘Sultan of Kordofan ’), Eng-
land,” shrieks the crow-eating victuallers’ organ,
“should have proclaimed El Mahdi as a traitor and
a murderous hound for whom the halter was too
good.” The stupid shailowpate who indited that
bit of rot doesn’t probably know that the Mahdi
owes no allegiance to England (nor, for the matter
of that to the Khedive either), and, evidently can’t
see thaq so far from being a hound, the Sultan of
Kordnfan is a gallant warrior and able diplomatist,
and, though by bad luck England’s enemy, a foe-
man worthy of her steel.
Thus the Riverine Evening Star not
unreasonably (only the Government couldn’t com-
ply with its suggestion without an Electoral Act
amending Act): —“ The Lower Murrumbldgee is
a squatter’s land: the Upper is the future home of
the agriculturalist. Each requires representation
peculiar to its different elements. The popple of
Wagga Wagga have only to press their right to a
borough member and no doubt the Government
will accede to their request. The Government in
doing so would please every one of the 5000 electors
of the present immense district; for in granting
a borough member to Wagga Wagga they could
also so divide the electorate as to give Narandera
an opportunity—which it does not now enjoy—of
electing a member thoroughly conversant with
the wants of the district, of which it is the rapidly
growing centre.”
Mr. Hugh M‘Coll came down from Man,
durang to Melbourne, quite lately, and travelled
around the office of the Chief Secretary, his poc-
kets stuffed out with papers, and the initiation of
a canal in each eye. When he turned the handle
of the door and got up against Mr. Berry, the
latter trembled for the fate of the Coalition, and
said, softlv, “Don’t, Hugh, don’t, and I'll do any-
thing.” “ Will >yer, first, nuta tellygraph efface
at Sebastiandemanded Hugh. “I will, Hugh,
I will.” “ Will yer, second, lift the Pyramid Hill
post-offace over the way ?” I will, Hugh, I will ”
Will yer, third, stick that fifteen hunaerd into the
shift?” “I will, Hugh, I will.” Then the groat
Hugh wired to the Mandurang people that toe
Coalition Ministers were the greatest and best
Victoria ever possessed, and Berry stretched him-
self and exclaimed “ Ha, let Mirams come on. I
have Hugh on my side.”
Christian August Selmer, one of the two
Norwegian Ministers of State, has been condemned
by the High Court of Justice on the charges of
delict preferred against him by the Odelsthing, and
sentenced to be deprived of all his offices under
the State, with all the costs of his impeachment.
The S.M. Herald, in referring to the matter, says
he was tried before “ the Rigoret, or Upper
Chamber.” In Norway, there is strictly no Upper
House. The whole legislative of the realm
is vested in the Storthing, which, when assembled,
divides itself into two houses-the ‘ Lagsthlng”
and the “ Odelsthing.” •* The Storthing (says
Martin) can also form itself into a High Court of
Justice for the impeachment and trial of Ministers.
The bill of accusation must always come
from the Odelsthing, and be brought from thence
to the Lagsthing, sitting for the occasion with the
Chief Court of Justice as ‘ Rigsretten,’ or supreme
tribunal of the realm.”
Tom Slattery should be mighty proud of
the following flattery, which we ciip from the
Burrowa Nuisance: “Mr. James Stevenson, slop-
shop assistant to his brother Isaac, says Mr.
Slattery will be returned for Burrowa in spite of
any opposition that Mr. Burns could give him.
We trust the day is far distant that will make
precious to his return the a sistance of Mr. James
Stevenson or his brother, or any evil-minded
Stygian pug-featured voter. Mr. Slattery cannot
forget the hellish sectarian cry that Stevenson
t tried to raise against him when he first announced
himself for the Burrowa electorate, or when he
accused him of being the puppet of ‘some
mysterious organization in Sydney.’ ” Ah ha !
That knocks the slop-assistant out in one round.

Aad Tom’s fervent prayer is that the Burrowa
lokslinger may soon be committed on a charge of
libel, to that he will have a chance to show his
gratitude by defending him.
Thus “Constant Reader” to the Armi-
paok Chronicle: —“ In your article on ‘The
Annexation Question’ the following passage
occurs:— ‘ Very little, if anything, except a great
deal of talking, has been done towards this con-
summation (confederation) since it was first sug-
ffestel by Sir Hercules Robinson.’ Will you kindly
allow me to state that Sir Hercules Robinson was
not the first to suggest the subject. Years before
his arrival in Australia it was introduced into the
Victorian Assembly by Sir Charles G. Duffy and
discussed at length by that body; it was also re-
ferred to in our own Assembly about the same
time.” The A. C.’s “Constant Reader” has evi-
dently forgotten (if ever he knew) that long prior
to Duffy’s first arrival in Australia (in ’58) the
question of federation had been broached over
and over again. In 18 i3 the committee appointed
finally to prepare a constitution for N.S.W. made
* variety of of suggestions on the subject.
TA.MWORTH TO EAST SYDNEY.
Fair Sydney Bust, surprised, we hear
That you must have our member dear,
You cannot really estimate
His value to a free, young state;
Or, in your h moments guess
The sort of treasure you'll possess;
So, with a true, becoming grace,
We yield him to your fond embrace.
In malting this groat sacrifice,
We really wish to see him rise
Body and soul into the skies!
For heaven made him at his birth
Oblivious of all things of e vrth.
To raise him from this obscure hole,
We’d send him to the Arctic pole,
Where ends the world, wild, vacant, bare—
Perchance he might bo useful there;
Or, should he 'ancy warmer lands,
Wo'd place him in El Madhi’s hands.
That was a curious crowd which stood
around Sydney Burdekin on the balcony at
Punch’s Hotel, after the declaration of the poll
for East Sydney election; but it was very sugges-
tive of the nature of the forces by which the
victory was won. First, there was the rugged and
unclassical John M’Elhone, “too full lor utter-
ance," but still actuated by that venom which he
go often mistakes for virtue; then there was A.
G. Taylor, M.P for Mudgee, whose brilliant and
sarcastic speeches had been no small factor in the
fight; on the left was the energetic and terribly
earnest B. W, O’Sullivan, whoso power of organ-
isation and unremitting activity, so grossly mis-
directed, had turned the scale in favour of his
candidate by cajoling labouring men to vote for
a representative of the capitalist class — their
worst foes: beside him was Jessep, the secretary
of the Orange institution, and at the back of them
all. smiling like Mephistopheles, was the once
great John Davies, who with cast-“lron” cheek
also attempted to address the spectators. It only
required the presence of Father Mahony to make
complete the extraordinary combination by which
George Houston Reid was defeated for the seat
where he had so often headed the poll. No doubt
gome of these men worked with an earnest desire
to vindicate their principles; but, if the truth
could only be elicited, we hear that others of the
number had joined in the hunt merely to satisfy
private spleen or serve some paltry end.
It would be well were all heads of Govern-
ments as resolute in resisting encroachments on
the rights of the people in the matter of parks,
harbour foreshores, &c., as “ Pam.” was in regard
to the “ exclusive ” proposals of his colleague,
Sir Benjamin Hall, with reference to the enclosing
of the Green Park (London) into shrubberies ana
keeping the people off the gras. As “Pam’s”
letter to Hall on the occasion we refer to is a
perfect model of prime-ministerial firmness, we
subjoin it in extenso for the rpecial behoof of
Stuart and his successors:—“ 94, Piccadilly, No-
vember 13th, 1857. My Dear Hall,—I have been
much surprised this morning at seeing a party of
labourers employed in trenching a large piece of
fine Green Park. As Head of the Government, I
have a right to expect that essential alterations
should not be made in the spaces allotted for the
enjoyment and recreation of the public without
my previous sanction and concurrence, and I en-
tirely disapprove of the restrictions which you
are imposing upon the free enjoyment of the
Green Park and Hyde Park by the public. Your
iron hurdles are an intolerable nuisance, and I
trust that you mean shortly to remove them. To
cut up the Green Park into enclosed shrub-
beries and plantations would be materially to
interfere with the enjoyment and free recreation
of the public; and I must positively forbid the
prosecution of any such scheme. As Head of the
Government, I should be held by the public to
have authorised these arrangements, and I do not
choose to be responsible for things which I disap-
prove.—Yours sincerely, Palmerston.”
Politics in Victoria have been very calm
late y, but it appears that they are not likely to
remain so very much longer. The developments
of the future will show that a new party will
spring 1 into existence ere long that will make
matters rather lively for the Servicc-cum-Berry
administration, which has enjoyed the sweets and
emoluments of office with such undisturbed quie-
tude. An organisation is in the course of for-
mation whicn promises to take the country by
surprise. The head centres a' e the Hon. W. U.
8mith, the gallant and wily Major who is noted for
the possession of such huge beetle-crushers that
people have to keep clear of him when they hear
hU footsteps, and Mr. James Mirams, the member
of Parliament of such diminutive stature. The
garrulous David Gaunson is to stump the country
on the new programme, i he Major is to open fire
at Ballarat previously to the opening of Parlia-
ment, Little Mirams is to follow suit; and they are
to be seconded by a number of aspiring politicians,
amongst wh m may be numbered Mr. John Fisher,
ex-M.L.A., Tom Bent, the astute and enterprising,
•J. P. T. Caulfield (who is to be secretary to the
new association), John Andrews, late member for
'vest Melbourne, Councillor Leonard, solicitor,
the facetious T. B. Healy, the defeated of West
Bourke, and Jack Woods, M.P. The prominent
plank in the platform of the new party is to be
the denunciation of the Railway Commission
appointed by the Service Ministry. The leader is
to be chosen from either Mirams or Major Smith,
l he former gentleman will probably be selected,
and the man with the big feet has expressed his
willingness to play second fiddle to his less gigantic

A correspondent writes under date Feb-
ruary 38, from Wilcannia, the very heart and soul
of the great Separation LeagueThis important
scheme originated in the brains of about five in-
dividuals, who are endeavouring to ‘seek the
bubble reputation,’ not, however, in the ‘ cannon’s
mouth.” They can’t lose anything over it except
a little breath occasionally, which is doubtless
beneficial; and should they by some miraculous
tiuke get what they are trying for, of course they
are made men from that day forth. They have
their respective billets cut and dried already.
Wouldn’t we shine out here as an independent
colony ! First item, railway from Hay to Wilcan-
nia. Second, lock the Darling from Bourke to
Wentworth. No more cockies ; no more money
sent to Sydney in the shape of rent, duties, &c. i
But, seriously, at least eight men out of every ten
1 meet ridicule the bare idea of it The fact of it
is there’s no unanimity (first time I used that word,
but I think it fits). One-half of the stations
belong to men residing in Melbourne and Adelaide,
a few to Sydneyites, and the remainder are worked
by the owners. These last are the men who want
separation. About the Land Bill, no one up here
believes It will ever pass. I defy the wisest states-
man that ever lived to frame a comprehensive
Land Bill that would suit the whole colony ; why,
you can’t go 50 miles in any direction without
going through country different in every respect
to what you have left behind you. Out here, some
patches there are that will almost carry a sheep to
the acre ; go on a tew miles and you will get into a
scrub of mallee pine, or something else that
wouldn’t carry a sheep to 50 acres. And as for
water, the Great Desert of Sahara can’t touch some
of this country. The rainfall is from six to ten
inches per annum ; sometimes not a drop for four
months. Try to sink wells, you may strike salt
water a dozen times before you get any fit
to drink, or you may sink six hundred or seven
hundred feet and get no water, either salt or fresh.
If the present Ministry think they are going to
replenish an empty exchequer by skilful squeezing
of the squatter fraternity, they’re simply out of it.
The squatters of the Western Division, I know
can t stand it, for the simple reason that most of
them are ‘ brokers’ already. Anyone interested in
this matter can form a fair idea of the value of
this country by finding out how much purchased
land there is on the runs. Perhaps 330 acres, here
and there, on a few; no more. Let this District
plod along for (say) twenty years as it is, and then
there may be a chance of increasing the revenue
by a new Land Bill. Why should poor beggars out
here have to pay for bad legislation and mistakes
in the past ? It’s like locking the stable-door after
the steed is stolen. The finest pastoral land in
N.S. W. is now all freehold, through the stupidity
of the persons in power. Look at Tonganmaln.
Groongal, Burrabogie, Cobran, and dozens of
others—each from 100,000 acres to probably 300,000
acres—all freehold, and in solid blocks—and in-
creasing annually, too, by buying out the * cocky I’
These gentry sell out down below, and now a
paternal Government wants to palm them off out
here on 10,000-aere blocks as miniature squatters,
lean t see any rhyme, reason, or justice in that.
What the Government should do is this: put some
sort Of a tax on these overgrown estates, as they
did in Victoria, and don’t come grinding the mar-
row out of us broken-down wretches, because a
man may hold a block or two, he should not be
considered fair game. He has, in most cases, to
borrow money to improve it; he pays good wages
to men who work for him; he has to [jolly well
stan e most of his time, living up here with the
thermometer 108" in the shade at 3 p.m. for weeks
at a stretch, waiting patiently for rain for months.
Believe me it’s not all ‘ cakes and ale.’ And what
is it all for ? What is the return for all this hard-
ship and worry ? Probably to be wound up by the
Bank, and have to clear out and join the Salvation
Army, or take a contract selling matches, or some-
thing in that line.”

Under a recent local Act, the county of Midlothian,
in which a great many working-class votes were
placed, has been electorally incorporated with the
city of Edinburgh. This circumstance, in con-
junction with the fact that the Bucoleuch agents
have been busy in the manufacture of hundreds of
fagot Tory votes, renders it uncertain whether
Gladstone would be safe to secure his return for
his present seat at the next general election. As
he must not be a candidate without certainty of
success, it is not unlikely that he will stand for
Edinburgh instead of Midlothian — Twenty of the

The story of the breakdown of the White
Star steamer Celtic, a day after leaving New York
is not without its pathos. For eleven long days
had the Celtic been rocking on the broad Atlantic,
when a horrid dread fell upon the passengers. The
whisky and brandy were running short. On th©
eleventh night drinks had to be curtailed ; the
smoking-room steward, with tears in his eyes,
begged of his customers to reduce their orders for
‘cocktails,” and to try to cultivate a taste for
bottled beer; and thirsty passengers began to
offer that officer heavy premiums for extra drinks.
But drooping hearts revived on the twelfth morn-
ing, when the good ship Britannic, also of th©
White Star line, cime to the rescue of her sister
vessel, and. previous to taking her in tow, sent off
a boat with a further supply of whisky and
brandy. A great shout went up to heaven from
the parched throats of the Celtic passengers as the
little boat came alongside them. They were
saved !

walls were blazing all round with burnished hel-
mets, swords, and bayonets, while rendevous were
made with names of the famous battles of the
regiment, from the “ Peninsula ” down to “ Egypt,

PERSONAL ITEMS.
The Evening Njsws states that the rumour
that Emelie Melville had been divorced from Mr.
Derby, as stated by the Neav York Clipper, is
“ entirely without foundation.”
Way up on the Herbert a man named
Mullins told his mate, Lacy, to put the muzzle of a
pistol in his (Mullins’s) mouth and pull the trigger,
Avhich he did, not supposing the blamed thing vvas
loaded. Lacy now swears he’ll never do the trick
again, and Mullins is apparently of the same
opinion.
A series of letters that passed between
Bradlaugh and C. J. Abraham, late Bisnop of Wel-
lington, N.Z , and now Canon of Lichfield,have been
published in the National Reformer. Bishop
Abraham had made a public statement, Avhich re-
flected on Bradlaugh’s sincerity and courage. The
prelate finally withdrew his imputation, and
expressed his regret that “he did not on h s own
part do justice to his (Bradlaugh’s) character.”
Lord Reay, whom it is said Gladstone
wishes to have appointed Governor of Victoria,
though an English and Scotch Baron, is by descent,
birth, and education, a Dutchman (suitable for
New Holland, you know). His father, Baron Mac-
kay D’Ophemert, vice-president of the Dutch
Privy Council, succeeded to the Scotch title in ’75,
and died in ’76. The present lord (born in ’39) was
naturalised in ’77, and created a peer of the United
Kingdom in ’81.
Twenty-two years ago Nubar, Tewflk’s
Prime Minister, was an Armenian interpreter,
earning some £100 a year. Then, Ismail taking a
fancy to him, he became a minister. In negotiat-
ing loans, much lucre stuck to his Angers. He is
noAv wealthy, while Egypt is ruined. Cause and
effect! “ Why,” remarks Labouchore, “ except
on the principle of set a thief to catch a thief, this
most successful marauder should bo appointed, by
our influence, Prime Minister, it is hard to say.”

Young Pym got “one stretch” with hard
labour for prigging that £97 from the G.P.O., and
Avould probably have got more, only the jury
recommended him to mercy on account of the

management of the postal department; so you
see, Milford, this crime can’t be either directly or
indirectly traced to tightness. We are anxiously
awaiting a report from Lamb ton, proving to his
OAvn satisfaction that the N.S.W. G.P.O., is (for
management) the boss G.P.O. in the universe.
Let us chronicle the departure of a dis-
tinguished citizen—Mr. Edward Perkins — Avhora
certain privileged people were wont to call Ned.
Perkins kept for a long time the Exchange Hotel
(now J. D. Young’s), and was celebrated for several
things. At certain periods he was the finest
amateur billiard player in Australia. Perhaps,
too, Ned gave away more eighteenpenny cigars
to civil servants than any other known man;
and if passing round the Bourbon gratuitously to
well-connected loafers can send him to heaven,
why »t. Peter had better get his key oiled.
Mr. F. W. Haddon has been made life-go ver-
nor of several public institutions in Victoria. He's
still unsatisfied. Life-governorships seem to belike
green fruit—tempting, but a source of painful
uneasiness. He Avants, and lugubriously wants, to
get on the list of the Benevolent Asylum, and last
week pleaded fervently for the luxury. He gave
them £60. But the committee say the money Avas
old Calvert’s. F. W. admits that, but rejoins that
old Calvert gave him plenary powers in the dis-
tribution of it, and that avherein it pleased him to
donate £60 to the Asylum, the honour is his due.
The matter is wonderfully small, but it’s a small
world altogether.
At a meeting held at the London Mansion
House, on March 3rd, It Avas resolved to erect a
suitable memorial to Waghorn, the pioneer of the
overland route to India. Should more money be
subscribed than can bo expended upon the me-
morial, the balance will be handed over to Captain
Waghorn's sisters, who are understood to be in
Avant. How eminently “ Podsnappish ” that cart-
beforo-the-horse suggestion! A couple of aged
ladies understood to be in Avant, and, if in some
future more or less remote, there should bo a bal-
ance from the memorial fund, they are to have it!
The better preliminary to the movement, and
of itself a kindly memorial to the enthusiastic
lieutenant to Avhom India, Australia, and Britain
are alike indebted, would be placing beyond a
doubt the comfort of his sisters, “ Avho are under-
stood to be in want.”
Is there no old title anywhere, even a
battered C.M.G., to bestow on L. L. Smith ? The
way that man works is a caution. Tne way he
drags his colony around the world, from capital to
capital—one time with a basket of grapi-s under its
arm, another time with a bag of potatoes on its
back, and at all times with a label on its forehead
imploring all people to look into its heart —is full
of bizarre pathos. He is at present in the throes
of angry indignation because Service will not send
samples of Victorian food to the London Food
Exhibition. Service doesn’t see the great gain to
be derived from the exposition of a cake of damper
and a junk of salt-horse. But L. L. sees it. He'd
have every chance of being chairman of the thing,
whatever shape it took. And is not that a dis-
tinction ? And don’t distinctions lead to something
grand ? And doesn’t L. L. yearn to be something
grand ?
Recently before Justice Patterson, of New
Fork, Robert Solomons, dealer in diamonds
from South Africa, accused Henry J. Rice, Jem
Mace’s manager, of having cheated him out of
$3709 at cards on board the Cunard steamer Servia,
Solomons said that he had made $125,000 deal ng in
diamond in South Africa, had lost the money in
Noav York in gambling, and had then gene bac<t to
Africa. There he made more money and he had
come back in the Servia to New York to open a
store. As she dropped anenor at Quarantine, he
went into the smoking saloon to play cards.
Somebody there gave him something to drink
Avith a drug in it, and he and the others began
matching soA r ereigns. They also played cards.
Rice Avon more than $3700. Justice Patterson de-
cided that the Court had no jurisdiction, and,
advised the men to settle it among thems dves,
and they did so. Solomons paid Kice’s lawyer $50
aud his expenses, and received $3780,
The humour of Mr. Purves, the much-
vaunted Melbourne barrister, is more refined than
that of most gentlemen who fatten on criminal
practice, and his jokes are as subtle as a circus
clown’s. Only the other day, the great Purves,
while engaged in his usual occupation of defend-
ing a prisoner, Avaxed wrath with one of his pro-
fessional brethren, Mr. M’Kean, for assisting the
prosecuting counsel with the loan of a magnifying
glass for the purpose of examining some marks on
jewellery. Mr. M’Kean not being engaged in this
particular case, the great P. determined to wither
him right up for his offioioueness; so, after asking
“Who is this tall gentleman?” ho indulged in a
piece of scathing satire on Mr. M’Kean’s height.
Said he to the witness, “Is this glass a kind of
telescope to show Avhether a man is run up by
contract or built like an ordinary man?” After
being dazzled by such a brilliant flash of wit, it
Avas not surprising that “ Mr. M’Kean leit the
Court at the first chance.” Under the same cir-
cumstances, most men would have done so—but
they Avould have returned with a pole-axe.
Henry George was born in Philadelphia in
1838 ; he began life as a compositor in that city ;
afterwards worked at the same employment in
San Francisco ; and became subsequently a re-
porter on the Sacramento Record, editor of the
California Times, and proprietor of a small
newspaper of his own. As long ago as ’69 he issued
a pamphlet on the land question. A series of
letters on the same theme were subsequently
published by him in the New York Tribune.
But it was not till 1877 that he applied himself to
writing the book which tvon him the great repu-
tation which he now enjoys. The author experi-
enced great difficulty in getting a publisher for
his Avork. None of the publishing houses of Noav
York, Boston, or Philadelphia would undertake to
produce it on their own responsibility. He Avas
therefore compelled to get the book printed in
San Francisco, Appleton and Co. agreeing to take
charge of the publication. It ran through no
fewer than fourteen editions in less than four
years ; was translated into German shortly after
its publication ; and has since been reproduced in
Spanish and other languages.
REV. CHARLES BADHAM, D.D.
Turn down the lights. The student’s task is done;
The last lino written Avith the last word right.
It, is the night-time, and for once he sleeps
Who made the shadowy Hours believe the sun
Was shining full into their vacant eyes.
For he was wont to sit, sti’ong-sighted, through
the night,
With thoughts ablaze, when from the silent steeps
Slow breath and dreamers’ dreams rose to the
skies.
Turn down the lights No more his genius keeps
The shadowy Houis alarmed with quiv’ring forms,
With ghosts of old dead poets, clang of rhyme,
With storm of echoing words lashed into storms
Of passion crowned with floAv’rs, as in the time
When men went mad with Passion crowned with
flow’rs.
Turn down the lights. Ho sleeps now, and the
Hours
Can pass and whisper: “Lo, they’ve quenched the
light!
The lights are out: ’tis night, ’tis night, ’tis night.”
Joseph Mackay, wno started more news-
papers in New Zealand and burst up oftener than
any other publisher in the colony, was ar-
rested at Timaru last month on a charge of
annexing a sura of £1 Is. 6d., the pro-
perty of the N.Z Government Insurance
Department. Joe’s latest newspaper venture,
the Southern Free Press, having gone the Avay
of all its predecessors, this enterprising rag planter
has been reduced of late to do odd jobs in the Avay
of canvassing and collecting for the Government
Insurance scheme, and in that capacity, it appears,
he has quarrelled with the heads of the depart-
ment about the management of the concern. He
even went so far as to inform the Colonial Treasurer
that the Avholeaffair avbs past redemption. Having
relieved his feelings in this way, Joe g.’x-aightway
started canvassing for a rival institution, and then
suddenly found himself locked up on a charge of
embezzlement. Whether Joseph forgot to account
for the £1 Is. (id., or claimed it as a lawful per-
quisite, time will shoiv. Meamvhilo. by latest ac-
counts, the case against him stands adjourned, and
Joe is out on bail.
Old Dr. Singleton, of Melbourne, who was
a doctor once, but is now a teetotal apostle and
an evangelist, has, at the Harmy’s request, written
his life. It is light, pleasant reading, but it is not
flippant! The doctor’s age is about 1740; and his
latter days have been embittered by the fact of
when visiting the gaols, and giving the prisoners
tracts, they invariably asked him for tobacco.
“ When in deep mental distress,” says the doctor,
“I fasted,” a proceeding which must have satis-
factorily met the views of his landlady. Dr. Single-
ton is a wonderful-looking old man, with a long
white beard, tall of stature; always dressed in
black, and carrying in his hand a tall gold-headed
cano. The doctor has really tried to do a lot of
good ; and, if giving away demi-octavo sheets
bearing the title “ Bobby and the Apple ” can have
had any beneficial results, the old gentleman must
have converted countless people. There is a legend
in Melbourne that the doctor is immortal, and the
undertakers have long given over following him
about and anxiously enquiring after his health.
The doctor has many harmless little peculiarities,
one of which is, when visiting a lock-up, to take
reporters for prisoners, and give them the tract
“Reflect!” with the sub-title “ To be read in your
cell.”
The will of the late Thomas Aitken. the
well-known proprietor of the Victoria Parade
Brewery, East Melbourne, was proved last week,
which shewed that the value of the property that
he had accumulated was something over £93,000.
Mo was a native of “ the bonnie hills of Scotland,”
and had acquired a knowledge of brewing in his
youth. He arrived in Melbourne about forty
years sgo, like thousands of others, without as
much capital as would raise a jingle on a tomb-
stone, and set to work at the first job offered. He
soon put together a few pounds, by practising
economy—in fact, the latter characteristic was
shown to such a degree that he used to relate, with
evident pride, that he married his first wife in
order to curtail the weekly expenses of washing,
&c. Having accumulated sufticient capital to start
on his o»n account, he erected a brewery in Mel-
bourne, which he carried on for some time, and
afterwards shifted the scene of his operations to
Geelong, where he remained a few years. Busi-
ness prospered with him, and he returned to
Melbourne and established the Parade Brewery,
which has since developed into one of the largest
concerns of its kind in the colonies. A distillery,
which he subsequently erected InCollingwood, has
also proved a financial success —in tact, whatever
he touched seemed to turn to gold. His funeral,
which took place about two months ago, was the
largest gathering of publicans we have seen,
except on the annual licensing day at the city
court.
Mr. Walker Redmond is the surgeon of the
Tambo Hospital, Queensland. On the publication,
in October last, of his medical registration in
New South Wales, our observant contemporary,
the Protestant Standard expressed a desire to
know Avhether he was in any way connected with
the Redmond brothers, their mission, or their
lectures. Similarity of name no doubt suggested
the kind inquiry. The following is an excerpt
from a letter receiA r ed by us from Mr. Redmond a
few days ago :—“ I Avish to inform that paper that
I am in no way related or connected with them—
that I am connected with no secret society, not
even being an Orangeman, though the son of an
Ulster one, who, though he sat in a lodge for thirty
years, advised his sons to avoid them. In ray
opinion, the Ulster Orangemen are the outgrowth
of profound ignorance and fanaticism combined.”
This tallies so exactly with our own views regard-
ing the society that, more than any other, has
helped to keep open wounds which might have
been healed generations ago, that Ave thought it as
well to publish it for the information of the
Standard and its numerous readers. To it is
mainly traceable the fact, disgracefully unique
among civilized nations, that a battle fought and
won on British soil two hundred years ago by a
foreign Prince, in command of foreign mercene-
rles, should to-day be instrumental in keeping up
a morose exclusiveness among neighbours in a
small European island, or hounding them to fly at
each others’ throats.
The present Mayor of Townsville is H. B.
Le T. Hubert, who has been said, on the very best
authority, to be descended from some ancient
Norman Baron, Avho married an aunt’s grand-
mothers cousin of Rollo’s mother-in-law’s friend
Until the last general election, this blue-blooded
representative of a noble but extinct aristo-
cracy Avas engaged in the royal occupa-
tion of hotel-keeping, which he forsook Avith
alacrity, when he found that it prevented
Griffith from conferring on him tho exalted
honour of J.P.-ship. Ho contested ToAvnsville at
the late election against Macrossan, but unhappily
the people Avere not awaie of his splendid descent
until after the case was decided, and so they put him
on the wrong side of the poll in a trifling minority of
something over 500. But the magnanimous Griffith
in one of those) transitory snasms of gratitude in
Avhich ho is ever ready to lavish honours that cost
him nothing, elevated his defeated nominee to the
magistracy, and at tho same time took off J. W.
Cirroll, of Townsville, one of the best-hearted,
most intelligent, and straightest white men in
North Queensland, whoso deadliest offence in
Sam’s eyes, probably, consisted in enthusiastically
supporting Macrossan. FolloAving the J,P.-ship
came the eleA r ati«n to the mayoralty, and when we
read over the names of the majority of the Towns-
ville aldermen, it is at once apparent that the
choice of Mayor Avas singularly appropriate. Long
may Sam’s chosen J.P. and ToAvnsvllle's chosen
mayor continue to occupy the positions he is so
eminently qualified to adorn.
The “ genuine Arthur Orton ” is again ex-
pressing his willingness to go to England for £1000,
and “clear up the mystery.” The “genuine
article” doesn’t make the offer personally, but
through the medium of a friend, a Mr. Fossey,
who describes him, in a letter to the Melbourne
Herald, as “the only link now wanted to com-
plete the case.” Now, what on earth can Mr.
Fossey mean by that ? Does the good gentleman
imagine that the production of a dozen “genuine
Arthur Ortons” can make the Claimant other
than a fat impostor, or that the appearance of
this “missing link” in person at the Tichborne
trial would have kept the “ unhappy nobleman ”
from “languishing in gaol ?” No, Mr. Fossey must
provide us with a “genuine Roger Tichborne ” if
he wants to do any business; there’s no doubt
that a “ Roger T.” would be in big demand at a
£1000, but “Arthur Ortons” are a drug on the
market-they’re not of any use at all. Mr. Fostey
himself, though, seems a good deal more like the
“link,” according to his letter, in which he states
“ At the time the steward of the Osprey brought
Roger Tichborne, the carpenter and sailor of tlm
late Bella, to Sandridge in th ; late Bella’s jolly boat
that saved them from a watery grave, myself,
Captain Chessell, and Lieutenant Crawford, the
pfiice magistrate of Sandridge, were present, and
were greatly Interested in Roger Tichborne.”
Now, considering the unhappy nobleman's friends
moved heaven and earth to find a record of any
Osprey existing at the period stated and couldn’t,
it’s a pity it Mr. Fossey won’t be “ the link.”
There is a neat little township on the
Queensland Central Railway, and a few miles dis-
tant is a station belonging to a frog-in-the-fable
sort of politician, notorious throughout the
colonies for the bumptiousness of his deportment
and the vigour of his language. The brother of
this important person, who resembles his distin-
guished relative in many charming respects, is
manager of the station, and when a Jockey Club
was formed in the township, ho was elected presi-
dent. At the first race meeting he volunteered or
consented to act as judge, but after the first race,
it became apparent that a man who used glasses
could not be depended on to see clearly enough
either the post or the horses which passed it fore-
most. So the stewards suggested that as the
weather was hot, and tended to a condensation of
moisture on the glasses, it would be as well to
divide the duties of judge with another. For three
days the races lasted, the rosy flowed and universal
fraternity blossomed, so that when the “judge”
departed he promised to any of the stewards who
might visit the station a welcome that would as-
tonish them. And he kept his word. Two of them,
some weeks afterwards, took a run over his way,
partly to look after some horses they had in that
direction and partly to enjoy a Sunday's outing.
Being in the neighbourhood, and troubled—the day
was a snorter—with a profuse perspiration, and a
thirst a bar-bummer would not part with for half-a-
crown, they determined to surprise their “judge ”
and take pot-luck. But the surprise was all on their
side, Avhen, after kicking the door for half an hour
the host appeared and asked them with the family
courtesy who the blank they were, and what
the blank they wanted. But why con-
tinue ? They asked him for a drink of Avater
and he pointed to a tank Avith a pannikin oil
top. Sorrowfully they rode back ten miles to the
nearest pub. and drowned their temper and their
thirst in beer.
During the reign of the M’llwraith Minis-
try, an “Inspector of State Forests” was appointed
in Queensland, and the chosen official was J. Vivian
Williams, a brother-in-law of Charles Hardie
Buzacott; but, of course, it would be blasphemous
to insinuate that C H.B.’s influence had anything
whatever to do with the appointment. It was an
experiment, and Williams Avas the selected expert-
menter. He went North Avith as clear an idea of
his duties as King Bambalo Cumwudgery has of
the movements of the heavenly bodies. After
wandering about the Northern seaport towns,
critically examining the surrounding forests from
his bedroom window and other points of vantage
and intervieAving old timber-getters famous for
their unrivalled lies, he recommended timber re-
serves in localities which no one has ever been able
to discover - , and which no one but Williams ever
heard of, and sent In a report which Qlled the
whole department with a Avhirlwind of blasphemy
and turned the Government Printer's hair prema-
turely grey in a hopeless attempt to find out what
it was Avritten about. When M’llwraith read it, he
saw at once that a man of Williams’ magnificent
abilities was scandalously wasted in the solitudes
of the Northern scrubs, and so John was ap-
pointed police magistrate in a remote Western
township, where he can have leisure to fathom
his great problem of the difference betAveen an
iron-barkanda swamp-oak, and settle the momen-
tous question of the relationship said to exist
between tho Geebung and the Crockabummie.
Every year the senior partner in the firm
of and Derham, sugar planters at Cairns,
goes to Melbourne Avith his family until the
Northern wet season is over. Before leaving this
year he called together all his retainers, paid and
unpaid, to inform them how the management
would be conducted in his absence. Among the
“audience” Avere seA r eral colonial experience
young men, Avho are amassing mines of knoAv-
ledge about plantations before starting their own
estates, and chief of these were “ Bob Sturt,” and
two young Parkes, Avhose sire is well-known in the
Bank of New South Warns. When these future
sugar leviathans heard the old man say he Avould
leave his son “Tom” in charge, as boss of the
Avhole caravansary, they went outside and dis-
cussed the subject in language that Avithered tho
surrounding vegetation anR set fire to a heap of
dry megass. Then Bob Sturt, a good-hearted
manly young Australian, went vo old Swallow as
ambassador plenipotentiary from the other revo-
lutionists, and informed him that they were all
prepared to strike Avith great enthusiasm if he
appointed Tom as commander-imchief. But the
golden syrup and Canterbury cake dictator re-
mained unshaken in his original resolve, and so
Sturt, Parkes Brothers, and Co. girded up their
loins, got the balance of their paper collars and
their other shirt, and struck a bee line for Cairns,
where they have since formed a tremendous
attraction to the hotel girls, Avho are now praying
for strikes on all the other estates, so that the
young men Avill fiock into town and ass'st them to
Avhile away the dreary late hours of the tropical
nights.
Sir ’Enery Parkes’ views on the subject of
an “Australian Peerage ” have evoked a big burst
of immetive from the Melbourne Herald. Says
the Herald:— “Just at the very time when sen-
sible Englishmen are blushing Avith shame that
despicable rascals like the present Dukes of Marl-
borough and Hamilton, &o., and others of their
notorious kind, should rule the destinies of the
empire, and monopolise the honours m the gift of
the Crown, Sir Henry Parkes comes forward to
deplore the fact that under present circumstances
the colonies cannot be conspicuously disgraced in
the same fashion.” Without going into the merits
of the “ hereditary legislators” question, or touch-
ing on the Avell-worn subject of the Duke of Marl-
borough’s chastity, it's yet just as well to inform
the Herald that the other dear Duke (Hamilton)
isn’t altogether a “ despicable rascal.” He hasn’t
figured in any divofee cases, and he lives on good
terms with the “ missus.” The Duke of Hamilton’s
principal “rascalities” have consisted in losing
hundreds of thousands on tho turf, with a smiling
face, and invariably lending his signature to any
impecunious friend. In spite of having lived all
his life in a fast set, this “ peer of England, Scot-
land, and France” is still very boyish in many of
his tastes; but he’s a remarkably burly boy, and a
first-class boxer. If he were to call in at the office
flourishing that “article,” the Herald wouldn’t
find him in the least “despicable.” And, by the
bye, as to the bearing of the goodness or badness
of the present batch of peers upon the “ hereditary
legislative” question, the present Duke of Marl-
borough's heir may turn out a model of piety,
whereas the very next Baron Tennyson might
proA - e a “ despicable rascal.” As a matter of fact,
many of the worst specimens of the “House”
wear coronets that Avere granted to their ancestors
for conspicuous ability and orthodoxy. Nor does
the House of Peers altogether “ rule the destinies
of the Empire.” When Mr. Gladstone procured
the Royal warrant on behalf of the “Abolition of
Purchase in the Army,” the peers bad very little
to do with the Empire’s destiny.
Railway Commissioner, who left a fine position id
the Midland Railway Company to take his present
billet, has a brother, T. W. Speight, also in too
M.R., and who is a litterateur ns well. He was a
protegA of Dickens, and used to contribute ratter
bad stories to All the Year Round. He pro-
duced a play once, too—“ The Ebony Casket '
which was damned with great success at a Gaiety
matinee : and he has likewise written some senais
tor Chambers’ Journal. Now that Richard lias
left the Midland, you will of course say that there
is now a little less Speight in the department. At
least, you can if you like. This is a (compara-
tively) free country.

decorate the Evening Alfred, have, of course,
in them, much of the spirit of sewing-the Tenor
tading, and you never read one without being
‘ ‘minded, somehow, of tea-cako. But “ A.” is, as
rnirards general style, superior to the rev, writers
Hunter-street, whereas in point of critical
acumen they arc about equal. If ever any of
them had any acumen, it has been mislaid. In
coturdav’s Herald appeared a notice (it is called
•‘areview”) of Lord Lytton’s life of his father,
and a mild attempt is made to throw the blame of
the separation between Bulwer Lytton and his
wife upon the latter. The Herald gravely assigns
the cause of the domestic trouble, a reason
ffiven by the author, who, it must be remembered,
Sided with his father all through. Says the bio-
traDher “ This distaste on my mother’s part to
the household functions devolving on a poor man’s
wife and in my father’s habits a curious mixture
nf refinement and frugality, was a latent source
nf future disappointment on both sides.” This is
•’funny—very.” Nothing about the gross extra-
vagance in his pleasures, counterbalanced by a
narsimoniousness in his household expenses which
bordered on the miserly. Why, is it not a matter
of history that this man “who had the head of a
Diogenes on the body of a grasshopper ” (see the
novel “Chevely”) put upon her every indignity
that cunning could suggest, every insult which
malignity could devise, until ho drove her shriek-
ing from the house to darken its doors with her
oresence no more. Bulwer, as a matter of fact,
like all geniuses, wanted more of everything than
anybody else—more wives, more money, and os
necially more adulation Dickens was the same,
and Eugene'Sue, and Balzac. Imagine, for in-
stance. Dickens whining piteously to Forster, be-
cause he had not cleared more than £1000 over one
of bis Christmas stories. “ I am sick at heart,” he
wrote, “and grievously disappointed.” We can
sympathise, thougn, with these strange traits of
tae great and gifted. That’s perhaps why the flre-
shovel is so often poised in the air, and one patten
is on the colonial sofa and one in the yard.
So far as fertility of imagination is con-
cerned Mr. Leroy Strickland can tie up one leg and
then dance rings round the most gifted descen-
dant of Ananias that ever slung a war correspon-
dent’s lecture. “ In a dimly-lighted room of a
sailor's boarding house,” says the New York
Tribune, “Leroy Strickland told the startling
story of his adventures among the cannibals of
New Guinea.” Mr Strickland, it appears, was
barely earning his “tucker” at Temora, about
four years ago, when he ran up against the letter
of a French surveyor, who had just escaped from
the man-eaters, and who “gave a glowing account
of the country, and said that there wore gold
pockets all along the coast and mines inches in-
terior.” Fired by this thrilling tale, Leroy and his
ten mates fitted up two heavy life-boats, and “set
sail from Temora to Cookstown ” (sic). From there
they rowed to the Fly lliver w here they found gold.
Before they had time to congratulate thems dves
however, 2J0 howling savages rushed upon them,
and William Giteau was at once killed by a “ wadi-
wadi,” which is probably a sort of yam, or a bottle
of patent medicine, or something else, which
evidently disagreed with William. After this, the
truthful Leroy, with a voice tremulous from the
recollection of the fearful scene, continued
thusly: “ On our way to the shore George Johnson
was killen bv a boomerang, and as I was crawling
into one of the boats a boomerang struck me on
the head and I lest consciousness. When we were
once in the boats we were safe, but then we saw
what a terrible fate had befallen our dead com-
panions. As we rowed away we saw the cannibals
seize the bodies and strip them. Then they carried
them to the top of the bluff and built a lire,
around which, as the Barnes grew fiercer, they
circled at a maddened pace. They howled and
shrieked in exultation at their victory, and after
they had exhausted themselves they squatted
about the fire and threw our companions into the
flames. I noticed that the human flesh burned
with a blue flame, and the sight was such a horrible
one that I fainted. When I recovered I saw them
tearing the flesh from the bones and eating it
amid the most discordant sounds I ever heard, and
after they had finished the fearful repast they
jumped to their feet again. As we passed around
a curve in the river they were still shrieking like
incarnate fiends.” Just here the Tribune man
uncorked a flask, and the New Guinea explorer
soon felt well enough to declare that the only
manner in which the country can be civilized is by
annihilating all the natives, a suggestion which
our missionary friends will no doubt speedily put
in practice. The natives along the coast are not
dangerous, because, as Mr. Strickland observes,
“men-of-war shell the bush every few weeks,”
and, of course, a dead nigger is seldom trouble-
some except in hot weather. Taking it altogether,
we are of opinion that if New York ever lacks
soap while Leroy is there, it will not be for want
of a good supply of lye.
One of the smartest men in New Zealand
at the present time is undoubtedly “Valparaiso
Jack” of Christchurch. V. J-’s autobiography is
now in the boiling-down works, and when com-
pleted and published will form one of the most
amazing records of adventure extant. Some of the
episodes of this history have occasionally leaked
out—usually after 11 p.m., under the opening in-
fluence of a few whiskies hot. One or two of these
items we will take the liberty of publishing in
advance. Many years ago, when Valparaiso Jack
was in charge of Her Majesty's mails at Lyttel-
ton, one of the steamers started away without
taking her mail bags on board. Jack, who was at
t h at time in the prime of his manhood, started in
pursuit by land, so as to intercept the steamer at
the “ heads.” Although he walked at the rate of
ten miles an hour, by a short cut, be was too late,
and lound the steamer had cleared the heads be-
fore his arrival. Nothing daunted, V. J. plunged
into the breakers, and swam afier the vessel with
the mail-bags on his back. After swimming five
miies he overtook the steamer, but could not get
her to stop, as the captain and crew were all sober,
and under such could not hear
him from the want of proper stimulants. Jack,
however, was equal to the emergency. Seizing
the screw with one hand, he forcibly compelled it
to stop revolving, and speedi'y brought the
steamer to a standstill. Then he handed up the
mail bags to the astonished captain, took his re-
ceipt for the same, remarked that the weather was
warm, and, bidding the crew bon voyage, calmly
turned him on his back, and kicked himself home
again at the rate of ten knots an hour. One of
Jack’s experiences in South America is equally
instructive. He was in Valparaiso during
°ne of those terrible convulsions of nature
which turn up periodically to re - adjust
the scenery and shift the survey pegs of that
Peculiar country. When the earthquake, on this
occasion, had shaken the city into a yelling dust-
neap, Jack found himself deposited on his head in
the great square, surrounded by a crowd of scream-
ing Americans in every conceivable condition of
junk and despair. Just as our hero had succeeded
m re versing his attitude, and had spread his lengthy
nether limbs across the street till his No. 13 boots
were about half a chain apart and firmly planted,
the earth opened between them in a Jong yawn-
mg gulf, which swallowed up nearly 2000 people
along the whole length of the plaza. When the
next convulsion started work to close this horrible
grave over the struggling mass of citizens below,
Jack at once twigged the earthquake’s little game,
and saying “No, you don’t—not this time, cocky,”
Planted his feet firmly on the sides of the gaping
(fitch, and straining every muscle to its utmost
tension, suc ceeded in keeping the orifice from
c osing. Again and again did that exasperated
earthquake gather all its forces to the task of
concluding its funereal contract, but each time
Jaclj § iron limbs withstood the terrible strain; an$
the Destroyer retired from the struggle,
fJm thp people were all Jifted out of the pit and
uvea happily ever afterwards. This is why V. J, is
fnownin South America as “ Jack the Deliverer,”
and well has he earned the title.
Augustus Glover sends us a note from the
tipera House. You remember, how last week, we
expressed so ne doubts as to his being a French-
man. Not, mind you, that it makes any real
vfT« nce w hence he comes. We know him as a
T,i« y “ ne actor only—one wc can always hear with
uy-ffujCt and, occasionally, with something re-
“ng, enthusiasm. But now that he has
us with a billet, we find that wo are ol 1
the family (the de Fivaa)-not personal
"us, but through the Grammaire clcs Oram-
maires published by his father M. de Fivas ever
so Jong 1 ago. We are half sorry he mentioned his
real patronymic, for the name calls up unpleasant
memories of the indignities we suffered through
those terrible French genders and irregular verbs.
Now, however, that ho has mentioned the matter,
we might as well tell why we received with such
academic faith the statement that he was a Gaul.
Our doubts should be rather flattering to him than
otherwise. It was alt along of his accent. To hear
our English come so trippingly from his tongue
suggested to us that'it was the language he took
in with his mother's milk. And, even now, we
make bold to remark that he could say “ it's as hot
as to-day,” at just as tender an age as he could
blurt out “ Ufait chautla.mme — anjourd'hui." De
Fivas pare, like a good many more French gentle-
men accompanied Charles X. to Scotland, when
the Revolution of July made things a little
“ mixed ” for that Monarch in beautiful, treacher-
ous Paris. Holyrood Palace was placed at the King’s
disposal while he lived, and a little colony of
emigres, nobles of the ci-devant court, planted it-
self around in the Scottish capital. No counter-
revolution ever came for them. Louis Phillippe,
the traitorous betrayer of his kinsman's trust,
clutched the crown he was charged to guard tor
another. Then his turn came to flee. Next the
Republic again, then the Prince President, the
massacres in the streets of Paris, and the bastard
Empire. These changes occupied long and weary
years. Charles X. died, and his little Court of
Exiles had to make shift for a living, dreaming the
while of the old ancestral estates and stately
chateaux in beautiful France. M. lo Vicomte
Victor de Fivas was among these unlucky faithful
ones. We did not know him, but we knew and
hated the Orammairc des Grammaires, which he
produced after a while, when he had taken to
teaching for a living the language in which he
had conversed with his peers in the Court of the
Tuilleries. Augustus Glover, “poor player,” is
the Vicomte’s youngest son. And. while we
think of it we may say the Orammairc was, youth-
ful prejudice noth withstanding, an excellent
woik, clear and methodical—so that the Vicomte
must have had good brains of his own, besides his
noble fidelity to a fallen master. Although we
had no personal acquaintance with M. de Fivas, we
remember well some of his cotemporaries. There
was our dear old teacher—M. Chaumont was his
business designation. Really, his title wad M. le
Comte de Chaumont. Him wo remember es-
Eecially well, because there was a close Intimacy
©tween our families. M. Chaumont lived in a
"flat,’—that French fashion of dividing houses
horizontally, which Edinburgh had long before
the Union been taught by her allies and constant
visitors, the Fx-ench. There Madame the Comtesse
and Mademoiselle Anna lived in simple fashion
But, ye gods! what a perfect gentleman M. Chau-
mont was, and how perfectly stately the unaffected
manners of Madame and Mademoiselle ! M. Chau-
mont conquered us, we remember, by sheer in-
fluence of gentle but lofty dignity. We woidd
chatter in class. He requested us to leave the
room, and towed us out. No grimace about it.
His bow was not a farce or a piece of mnunte-
bankery. It was the grave salute of an offended
gentleman. We stood this treatment twice, we
remember—offending the second time more from
thoughtlessness than intention. And a third time
we were bowed out, with a few words of grave
remonstrance from M. Chaumont that we should
so lightly esteem him-so slightly respect our-
selves. We were not outside five minutes that
that time. We couldn't stand it. We marched in,
respectfully advanced to the true gentleman, and
with an attempt to adopt his own courtety,
formally apologized to him in the face of the
whole class. It did the lot of us good, that little
scene. After that, there wasn’t a lad among
us who wasn’t restrained by the sense that to
offend that master would have been to figure as
a sort of underbred oaf. Then, again, there was
M. le Marquis d’Bgville—also a member of la haute
noblesse. JVJ. d’rk v.lle had been an amaieux < f
music, and played the violin. Madame la Mar-
quise and the two young ladies played the piano,
of course. M.d’Egville and family taught dancing.
We learned from Madame and Mademoiselle. But
it is so very long ago, and we were such a very
little chap, that we don’t remember much about
it- Our liveliest- recollection of the d’Kgvilles is
later, that they dx-ove about to their professional
visits in a barouche, and dressed more splendidly
than was usual in the canny Scottish capital. Our
juvenile Impressions were somewhat coloured by
surroundings. The d’Egvilles were to us aggres-
sively' frog-eating French dancing people, and,
as “ Papists,” mysteriously dreadful; and it
plunged our youthful ideas into the wildest con-
fusion when, on the Queen’s visiting Edinburgh and
holding a lev£e and drawingroom a- Holyrood,
the d’Bgvilles were among those who were re-
ceived by Her Majesty.

Last Sunday week, the parish ‘‘praste ” of
a town out West announced from the pulpit during
the service that there would be two meetings held
m the adjoining schoolroom that day-one meeting
to organise steps to clear the debt off the church
to.be held immediately after Mass; and the other
meeting, to be held at 4 p.m., for the purpose of
hi r inging a programme for the athletic sports and
• mvarshuns set down for St. Pathrick s Day-
Only t wo turned up at the first meeting-the Driest
himself, and the local carpenter, who had an eye
to future contracts. But when the meeting to fl V
the "spoorts” cam© on, the committee had tn

the locks off the doors, to make room for the
programme! Jam m t0 wor,y up St ‘
The quarter-deck of that now historical
old dug-out, H.M.S, Galatea, is the scene of this
silvery legend: It seems H.R.H. had been told
some curious stories of the skill with which one of
the oirpenter’s mates on board handled that ugly
instrument yclept an adze; and, at length, one tine
morning the man was called aft and told to prepare
to exhibit his favourite and most daring feat
before the Prince. Returning in a few minutes
with his “ crooked axe ” (as the West Coast niggers
have it), he asked the assembled “ after-guard ” to
lend him a two-shilling piece, and after a lot of
fossicking, “Alf.” at last tossed him the coin,
which laying flat on the deck, under the ball of
the big toe, and exactly level with the p ejecting
edga of the nail, the ‘‘offside” chips, with one
tremendous circular sweep, brought his weapon
whizzing down, apparently doing his level best at
self-amputation; and as the lookers-on instinc-
tively prepared to collect the pieces, he stooped
down, and extracting from beneath his foot two
shining flat discs of silver, he advanced and pre-
sented them to H.R.H. The florin was as neatly
severed, horizontally, as If done by a machine. This
happentd before the days of Australi in visits, or
"Alf.” would undoubtedly have issued the now
famous mandate to “Pack the lot up carefully,
please.” As it was, he only remarked, “De-ah
mel how nice!”


SUNDRY SHOWS.
Theatre Royal—“Rip Van Winkle” p 8
Opera House—“ Fedora ” ib.
“ Fedora” is still drawing good houses.
The story, as you must be aware, is a sad one,
with a very sad termination, but there are a few
bright pages in it, and the brightest of all is Miss
Maggie Ford. She is a page you linger on and
regret to part with. Her appearance suggests how
nice i must be to have a large establishment, with
footmen and pages by the score, tumbling over
one another to do your bidding. And yet how dull
even this is compared with the pleasure of seeing
an elderly man of high station, heavy weight, and
known piety slip on an orange-peel in a crowded
thoroughfare, and send a flag six Inches below its
proper level with the emphasis of his caress ?
• • • •
Aproiios of Fedora: — Watching the
movements of a lithe, well-dressed woman
suggests the oddest thoughts. We know
the dress she wears so becomingly would bo
thought hideous a year or two ago, and evoke
laughter—boisterous or well-bred, according to
the manners of the observer—next year or the
year after. What looked so ravishingly seductive
as the crinolines as big as a ball-tent, introduced—
but not for the first time—by Eugenie, when,
through who was as much a Bona-
parte as the Wagga butcher a Tichborne, she oc-
cupied the place In Europe since “jumped” by
one Bismarck ? And this minds us of the spicy
things Frenchmen are so fond of saying of the
terrible German who fired them out oi the Con-
tinental stage-box a few years ago, and slid into
their place, while they had to put up with the
stalls, and feel thankful they weren’t sent to the
pit. You will remember how Frederick the
Great, incognito, kept himself by sticking to a
lamn-post, from sitting in the Ber-
lin mud to laugh when he saw a
bill-sticker pasting up a flaming
placard before a frowsy, delighted
crowd. The notice imformed his
loving subjects that their Monarch,
although speaking French like his
guest Voltaire—which was wrong—
was probably the biggest rascal in
Europe—which was certainly right.
“Ah,” said the robber of Silesia,
when his equanimity came back
with his second wind, “You see they
say as they like, but by I do as
I like.” Well, you see, that’s just
the position of Prance and Bis-
marck to-day. Not, of course, that
the Prince is a political rascal. Far
from it. Still he could tie a good
many in that line, and it’s not quite
safe to disregard his opinions con-
cerning European frontiers, bound-
aries and—for want of abetter term
—“tiddly-winking.” So now it has
been discovered by one of those
Gauls who started d Berlin in the
Summer of 1870, and, with a few
hundred thousand of their com-
rades, somehow missed their road,
that, when Bismarck once visited
Paris, he brought with him, from
beyond the Rhine, a wife rejoicing
in the biggest feet in her own
country, and a daughter who fol-
lowed in her mother’s footsteps.
* * *
You get used to female dresses.
When a man is really “ gone ” on a
woman she might bo clad in sun-
shine, like New Hebridean princes
of the blood, for all he cares. Just
think of the mirth that would find
vent in the tongue of Aristophanes
if some of those old Greeks, to
whom we pretend to be indebted for
all our ideas of the “beautiful” in
face and form, were to see a modern
ladv smuggling under an improver!
And yet, when “Fedora” appears
with a development suggesting that
a neighbouring orchard had been
robbed, or that an extensive Are, at
which she was present, had occurred
down Anthony Hordern’s way, you
feel satisfied that perfection in
feminine adornments had been
reached at last, and that there was
nothing now left for our wives,
mothers, and belle-meres, but to copy
as closely as their purses or physical
angularities will permit. Ah! there
is the danger. Think of it—picture
it—a fat, fair, stumpy, large-boned
relative with weak eyes, provincial
■patois, and shuffling step, dressing as
the princess 1 We shall not pursue
the subject. The vista of madden-
ing possibility it opens up, cows us-
prompts us to entertain with calm-
ness the prospect even of becoming
a civil servant, or a gaol inspector.
* * *
We care little about surroundings.
Hearing Bellcw, Montgomery or
Miss Dargon read, was enough of a
treat without the accompaniments
of gorgeously-dressed flunkeys or
msthetic boudoirs. Still, when men
and women have to appear on the
stage in evening dress, it is just as
well that their clothes shouH lit
them, that they should not hang on
them as they do on drapers’ dum-
mies, or undertakers’ assistants out
of a job. There is this to be said,
even for those supernumeiary
males who attend Fedora’s recep-
tions, and have little to do except
venture an occasional common-
place about the weather, or become infatuated
with cartes in a photographic album—that it re-
quires no great stretch of fancy, to imagine them
Oi dinary, well-bred men of the world, to whom
the drawing-room of a princess is more familiar
than a seat behind a three-penny bar, or the iront
form in a rat-pit. And the orchestra too. It is
pleasant during the intervals to hear judiciously-
chosen selections from the works of standard
composers, instead of the stuff fired at you by the
two fiddles, cymbals and wry-necked fife, compos-
ing the oi dinary orchestra. There is not such a
temptation to sneak into the bar and “rastle”
with the fiery “ swill,” for which Sydney is so in-
famously famous, when a company of good per-
formers is busy with tit-bits from Bellini and
Donizetti.
* * * *
On Thursday last a card was sent us, ask 1
ing us to look" into the Glebe Town Hall that
evening and say what we thought about the
“grand dramatic and musical entertainment” by
the “ Sydney Amateur Comedy Company a
combination rejoicing (according to the bill) in the
patronage of Lord Augustus Loftus and the pre-
sidency of D. O'Connor, Esq., M.L. A. We not only
looked in, but, at the invitation of a fair-spoken
official, took a chair and waited for circumstances
to develop themselves. The hall was fllied. The
funds of the Derwent Cricket Club were to benefit
by the plunder, and the “ Deal Boatman,” fol-
lowed by a musical melange, and terminating
with “Tne Quiet Family,” was the piece chosen
for representation.
♦ * *
We always like this piece. Of course we
don’t know what it’s about, but this only makes us
like it all the more. Like eternity it appears to
have neither beginning nor end, but to be all
“ middle.” There is a boatman, or at least a per-
son who lives in the neighbourhood of the sea, and
skims the water for his Dread. He is of the ortho-
dox pattern, and has as strong a liking for undi-
luted spirits, and as great an aversion for the letter
“h” as most men of his class. But his ’art is in
the correct place, and thoroughly sound. Most
theatre-goers must have noticed that when a per-
son appears before them on the stage with a “sou’-
wester ” hat, a large muffler and a blue cotton
guernsey—when he is preceded, accompanied, and
followed by an odour of llsh in an advanced stage
of decomposition—when he swallows raw spirits
by the tumbler—and, above all, when there is
some pale-faced, meek-eyed female waiting for
him at home, or rousing him out of public-houses
when he sells his fish—he can always be relied on
to bo sound at the bottom, however much his con-
duct and conversation may tell against him. Well,
this Jacob Vance (Mr. C. L. Qwist) had a daughter
or niece, Mary (Miss Alma Fairfax), who is engaged
to one Mat Brambur (Mr. C. Purdue). As soon as
you see Mat and Mary, you know there’ll be
trouble—he is such a lout, and she such a morsel.
She is darning stockings when the curtain rises,
and running away with a strange man when it
falls. But, whether sewing or “scooting,” she is
the daintiest little body that ever made a man’s
cceur belt his ribs like a Kerry mob a tithe-proctor.
Nothing that we have said must put it in Mary’s
little head that she is a Rachel or a Majeroni. No;
she is simply a shapely, handsome girl, heavily
handicapped in the way of relations and lover. We
have seen men struggle against adversity, police-
men, and tram-conductors, but the struggle of
the Glebe audience to keep themselves from stuff-
ing their mouths with their superfluous clothing,
when Mat Brambur was before them striving to
kiss the girl who was shortly to bo his wife, re-
flects the greatest credit on the control the citizens
of that thriving suburb have over their feelings.
* * *
Jacob Vance, the boatman, is a mariner
possessing many peculiarities of manner and voice.
The passage of half-a-dozen full-grown blood-
hounds through a tortuous thoroughfare, each
attached to a damaged kerosene tin of road metal,
might tie, but not surpass, the maddening discord
of that voice. Of course it is assumed, for, except
in the lower register of a Scotch bag-pipes, it
would be vain to search for anything resembling
it. It is when he sings that you regret you are not
near him with a life-preserver. Mary, like a sensible
girl,has two strings to her bow. We have referred to
one. The other is Edward Leslie (Mr. A. J. Perdue).
He is a haughty young man of the Vere de Yere
set. He makes the best part of his running while
she is preparing her trousseau tor her marriage
with Mat. When the time for the ceremony
arrives there is a slight hitch, as the bride has
“shoved” with Leslie. To a wedding as to a
quarrel there must be two persons. This elemen-
tary fact at last dawns upon Mat and Jacob, and
the first act ends with the temporary triumph of
vice. We know it was but temporary for on
leaving we asked at the door whether things would
come right and were assured that they would. We
had to leave, as a wife and children are depending
upon us for a living, and we felt that the second
act of the “ Deal Boatman” would about settle us.
We therefore cannot speak of the “musical
interlude,” or.the farcical comedy of “The Quiet
Family,” but have no doubt they were gone
through creditably. On Saturday morning we
just glanced through the police news to see if any
assaults of a murderous character had occurred in
the vicinity of the Glebe Town Hall on Thursday
night—if any of the audience had waited on the
company with a crow-bar—but found that beyond
some badinage of a slightly personal nature, the
peace had not been disturbed. We have hired the
front row of chairs for all subsequent perform-
ances of this troupe, and will go better prepared
for contingencies next time.

Dear old Emily Soldene, the inside of
whose mouth (it’s the grandest on the stage) always
possessed such a strange fascination for us, seems
to have retired finally from opera bouffs, and to
have returned to her early love, the music-hall.
It was as Drogan, in the English version of “ Gene-
vieve de Brabant,” that she made her first appear-
ance as a prima donna, and great was the astonish-
ment of the London public on discovering that
the new “star,” Miss Soldene, whom all the town
was rushing to hear, was none other than their old
friend, Madame Soldeni, a ballad singer at the
music-halls. Unfortunately for Emil.y, her chance
of distinguishing herself didn’t come as soon as it
might; and although it cafft bo more than four-
teen years ago since “ Genevieve de Brabant ” was
produced at the Philharmonic Theatre (as it was
then called), she is almost an old woman now, and
her voice is terribly worn. Still, if her notes are
not as silvery as of yore, her mouth, no doubt,
retains its ancient “ comprehensiveness,” and
Soldene’s old admirers will get just as good a view
o f the roof of it as they did in her best days.

“ Blue Jackets in Zanzibar,” a comic
musical opera, in 3 acts, will probably be produced
for the first time at the Tivoli Opera House, San
Francisco. John Knell is composer of the music,
and Hector A. Stuart, the Australian poet, or
“ South Sea Bard,” author of the libretto. The
romantic opera of “ Otumba,” libretto by
the same writer, with music by Wilhelm
Borchert, of the Conservatory of Music, Ber-
lin, is also promised ja staging at Deakln’s
Academy of Music, Milwaukee. These are both
pronounced works of unusual merit, and likely to
create a sensation.

English, the pantaloon last Christmas at
the Brighton Theatre, was convulsing his audience
with laughter while his wife was being burned to
death at Portsmouth. Two days alter he had to
attend her funeral and then hurry away to don his
pantaloon dress for the night's performance.
Wi.son Barrett, it is declared, has been
offered a six months’ engagement in America, at a
salary of £1400 a week. What howling bosh this
is. His noble self, and the whole of his London
company thrown in, for £1400 a week, would prove
a bad spec, for any American importers. Barrett
is a “horse of quite another colour” to Irving,
and his best things—“ Lights o’London,” “Romany
Rye,” and “ Silver King ’’—have already been done
to death in the States. “ Claudian,” certainly,
which he has just produced at home, is admittedly
a high-class play; but, like most “high-class”
things, it’s rather too slow- and wouldn’t pay very
well at £233 6s. 8d. per night for the loading man.
“ Those newspapers will say anything.”
Luscombe Searrelle seems to have left
America for some considerable time. The legacy
he has left to the States is one of the most splendid
legends on record. Here it is, just as it was hurled
at and probably nearly killed a N.Y. Mirror re-
porter :—“ I have been offered a position as
manager of one of the Estrella companies playing
in the English provinces. The opera is doing well
there, and I have just received news from Sydney,
N.S.W., that it has likewise made a great success
there. I had three offers to remain in the States,
but would rather go back to England. I have
been very kindly treated here, but misfortune
followed me, and the Standard fire was fatal to my
success.” With this enthralling item, we will
give you—we don’t know why—a list of the attrac-
tions, etc., Messrs. Allison and Rignold have
engaged. The whole of the Madison-square Com-
pany (1); “In the Ranks,” by G. R. Sims; the
fifteen Chicago champion baseball players; the
American tragedian, T. W. Keen, for an Austra-
lian tour in 1884-5, and purchased “ New Babylon ’’
for production in the States. While in New York
Mr. Allison purchased the Australian right of
the following plays: “Young Mrs. Winthorpe,”
“Young Folks' Ways;” “ Belmont’s Pride;” “Tom
Planter’s Wife;” “ Dollars and Cents;” “ Stranglers
of Paris;” “La Belle Russe; ’ “Under the Polar
Star;” “Pulse of New York;” and “May Blos-
som.” But the big things are yet to come! Mr.
Allison has purchased the right of “ Glad Tidings,”
a melodrama by Willing; and here is the bonne
bouche : “ Mr. Allison has also commissioned Mr,
A. P. Martin to write an original character drama
for Mr. Gus Williams, the popular American
comedian.” Mr. A. P. Martin, it will be remem-
bered, was the very big man who used to write
the very little sonnets in the Melbourne Review.
With respect to the report below referred
to, and mentioned in our issue of Feb. 17th, we
observe the following in the Lorgnette, pub-
lished in Melbourne;—“Miss Emelie Melville: We
have been given to understand that a paragraph
that appeared in our columns some short time
since, stating that ‘Mr. Derby had obtained a
divorce from his wife, Miss Emelie Melville,’ and
which was copied verbatim from the New York
Clipper, a high-class theatrical journal, is entirely
without foundation. We are satisfied of the un-
truth of the statement, from the tenor of recent
letters received by Mrs. Derby from her husband,
in which she is addressed in terms of the greatest
affection and regard. We regret any annovance
that might have been felt by the accomplished
cantatrlce, and feel sure that on her re-appearance
in Melbourne shortly, she will receive a deservedly
warm and enthusiastic welcome.” Like the Lorg-
nette, we copied the statement from the Now
\ ork Clipper, and we, too, have therefore to

We dropped in at the “ Aca-
demy ” during the week to see the
last act of “Margaret Catchpole.”
Last week we did Muflin Pegs an
injustice—unwittingly ’tis true, but
an injustice all the same. There is
no mystery about his fate. He was
a good deal cut up, naturally
enough, at being found in the out-
laws’ stronghold. Indeed, at one
time, from the turn affairs were
taking, we thought it might be
necessary to cut him down. But ho
pulls through, and we next find him
inN.8. Wales. It *s how he came
hero that is so mysterious. Wo
waited for him at the stage door to
put the question to him straight,
but when he appeared wo felt that
it was too delicate, and held our
tongue. There’s no mistake at all
about Margaret—she’s “lagged”
right enough, and, when wo next
see her, she is wandering through
the bush during a severe thundei-
storm. It was when the boy behind
the scenes, who is “running” the
elemental strife by means of a
skittle “ cheese ” and the flat of a
spade, pauses to take breath that
she becomes aware that she is not
alone. The smuggler that shot Will
Laud is there also, and, during the
pauses in the storm, confesses every
thing to a big gum-tree, under
which he’s taken shelter. We don t
remember ever to have seen a thoi -
ough exnlanation ofthis well-known
fact—that, whenever a bad man
hears thunder, he goes down on his
knees at once, and tells everything.
When it gets line again he often re-
grets his hurry, especially as it
makes another crime necessary—to
knock on the head the person whom
he has made his confidante. Well,
this outlaw, it appears, had at one
time dreams of innocence and love.
He was “ mashed ” on Margaret, anc
when he saw Laud throw her the
rope over the prison wall, he planted
about two pounds o f swan-shot in
William’s little “ turn." Lead is at
all times a hard thing to digest,
even when taken by the mouth.
How that unwholesomeness is in-
creased when it has to make a hole
for itself in the system, need not bo
dwelt npon. So Margaret comes
forward, and confesses who she is
to the truculent and superstitious
villain on the ground. This brings
him to himself, and, drawing a haj -
knife from his girdle, he “ goes ” for
the doomed girl with a ferocity
painful to witness.
* ♦ ♦
There is a struggle, short and in-
tense, but, to the great relief of all,
Maggie obtains possession of the
weapon and digs it into him with a
neatness that cannot be commended
too highly. She is a convict, you
remember, at this time, and as all
female convicts of the period had
nothing to do but wear broad-brim-
med hats, and wander about the
bush, she wasn’t so badly off after
all. She comes across her old sweet-
heart—him she threw over to follow
Laud—and probably marries him,
although the play doesn't say so.
His residence in N.S. Wales has
rather developed his good qualities,
and when he remarks; “The man
who would desert a suffering
woman in the hour of need is un-
worthy of the name he bears,”
the applause was general and
hearty. The last we see of Margaret
she is in a boat during a flood rescuing a man from
a little house like a judge’s stand at a racecourse.
The termination is rather abrupt, and leaves us in
doubt on many important points we hoped to have
seen cleared up. As Margaret Catchpole, Miss
Wilton has a difficult part to perform—a part re-
quiring a variety of accomplishments and bodily
peculiarities. She is not yet stout—just nice, you
know—so her abduction can be affected without
the aid of machinery. When an actress turns the
scale at 14st., she should either leave off “swoon-
ing” and eloping parts, or else keep a drayman
within call to get over any little hitch in removing
her. Under the most trying circumstances. Miss
W. keeps up her spirits, and although we freely
admit she “ shook ” the horse, still, under similar
temptations, a lees carefully-trained person might
run away with half-a-dozen.
Eucalyptus wine is good to taste and com-
forting to the soul, say the monks who make it.
It is made at the Abbey delle Tre Fontane, in the
heart of the wild Campagna, some miles from
Rome, on the very spot whore, it is said, St. Paul
was martyred. The malaria of the Abbey site
was so bad that men could scarcely live, so
the eucalyptus was planted to absorb the
pestilence from the atmosphere, with the result
that it is now tolerably healthy. And the monks
support themselves chiefly by the sale of their
eucalyptus wine.
This, though it occurred not far off, hasn’t
been published yet. A barber in a large town
favoured his lady clients with New year cards,
and to each he affixed his own name, in a cramped,
foreign hand. But the great feature was a largo
assortment of circumflex accents, distributed with
such a lavish Impartiality as to adorn o’s j’s and
w s as often as the usual privileged letters, besides
occasionally decorating an empty space. Being
questioned why he had sown circumflexes with
such a very free hand, the tonsorial artist replied
that he used them for “style;” he only served the
aristocracy, they would understand.

PEPPER AND SALT.
ON A DEAD POLITICIAN.
And thou art gone, with all thy artless ways,
The rich to crawl to, and the poor to praise.
No polling-day breaks in upon thy calm,
And dust for gold now fills thy Itchless palm.
No more the mad selectors howl around.
But each near neighbour holds in fee his ground.
And thou art gone. Yet seasons come and go;
And still the tides and fortunes ebb and flow.
While whiz the jav’lins of the “outs” and “ins,”
And statesmen perish o’er a tax on pins,
Still in our ears rings loud the wordy fray,
And scarcely missed thy old familiar bray.
The seat which once thy mindless welghtdid press,
Another presses with a mind much less;
And where for nothing we had looked before.
We have it now but in an ampler store.
Sleep on. The country that with thee was blest
But mourns thou art not neighboured by the rest.
We leave thee there, beneath the silent skies,
Till thou with all thy caucused brethren rise,
At summons of that Last Division bell
Which takes the dubious vote for Heaven or Hell,
He is known amongst the “mimbersof the
foorce ” as 44 Little Johnny,” and to the general
public as the driver of 44 Black Maria,” the Govern*
ment coach which runs between Melbourne lock
Up and Pentrldge. In his younger days, Johnny
was a splendid rough rider, and could “knock the
stuffing,” so to speak, out of the most vicious colt
that ever cantered in the Government paddock,
but as he grew older he increased in bulk, and
became too heavy for the breaking-in business.
Then he was promoted to the position of driver of
44 Black Marla.” One morning he drove up to the
entrance of the lock-up in Little Collins-streot,
but the gates were not open, and as his aide-de-
camp was not present to bear a hand, Johnny sang
out to some youths standing alongside, “ Open the
gates please.” The order was quickly obeyed, and
as he drove through he acknowledged the service
by cheerily saying 44 Thank you, boys, thank you ;
I’ll give you all a drive for this some day.” And it
was not until he saw some of the “boys” looking
up loose boulders,and handling their sticks in a war.
like manner that it occurred to his mind that his
remark could bear any other meaning than that
of a complimentary nature.

“The Rev. Thomas Cushing, vicar of San-
durch (England), recently eloped with a parish-
ioner, Miss Huntley, daughter of the late Mayor of
Sandurch, and a shining light of the Congrega-
tional Church. Great sympathy is felt for his wife
and two children, whom he has left entirely desti-
tute.”—Abridged from Saturday’s News.
How we’d have loved to hear thee preach,
In part a snuffle and a whine!
The road to all that’s moral teach—
Lay down what’s pure, thou false divine!
Oh, what a sight one’s eyes to greet,
Thou giving forth the “ cake and wine,”
With fair youth kneeling at thy feet—
O, what a dread, unholy shrine!
Ah! to have heard thee “probe each soul,”
When there, revered, amongst them all;
Thy voice with moral precepts roll,
With thy black heart replete with gall I
The devil, when thou leav’st this life,
The epitaph, thou knave, wilt carve
Of him who left asuff’rlng wife,
And bairns, perchance, to die or starve.
And, if there is the hell they say,
Ignoble wretch, thou’ll surely see, *
When comes the read-of 44 Judgment Day,”
That hell will surely yawn for thee.
The bells are done—no time to lose—
To church we must betake us now!
And yet one minister—who knows ?—
May be as big a rogue as thou 1

On a well-known Western Queensland pro-
perty owned by a firm of 44 honorables,” and
“bossed” by a full staff of younger sons of aris-
tocratic lineage, a contretemps occurred in the
shearing shed a season or two ago which well-nigh
resulted in a total cessation of work during the
busiest portion of the year. Imperative orders
were subsequently given that not one of the
former 44 shed hands ” were to be again accommo-
dated at the “board.” As the shearing season
once more came round, many of the old “ navi-
gators ” put in an appearance, but were subjected
to an examination by the “boss” of the shed,
which ran in this wise: 44 My man, are you a
shewah ?’’ “Yes, sir.” 44 Did you sheah heah last
yeah?” “Yes, sir.” 44 Ah, we shan’trequiah you
to sheah heah this yeah.”

It was at the plough the genius of poetry
found Burns and threw her mantle over him. The
same garment, badly tattered, it is true, has just
fallen on a N.S. Wales navvy. Poesy, like law, you
know, is no respecter of persons, and is just as
ikely to visit a navvy at his bread and bacon, as to
!peep into the palace of a monarch. This particular
’orny 'anded son of toil explains in six verses, with
a chorus to each, the cause of the late strike. We
give the last only, as, if we gave all, our own
poets might retire crestfallen from a field in which
they c’ouid not hope for success against such a
competitor:—
“ And if the Town and Country
With our conduct don’t agree,
We will recommend it to join Cob and Jo.,
And accompany them up a tree.
With.the Careys and the crawlers
That are along the line,
We will settle up accounts with
Them upon some future time.
“ The navvies cried 4 lo-Ho I ’
They mustered in great numbers,
And down the street did go.”
The foregoing certainly leaves no room for doubt
as to “the cause of the strike.” But the gifted
author omits to say who struck him.
The anecdote of “Bang went saxpence,”
related of a miserly Scotchman, has been eclipsed
in meanness by an incident told of another Indi-
vidual—a modern specimen of the same race. A
Scotchman occupying ihe position of a Crown
Minister in one of the colonies, whose income at
the time was £3000 a year, was over in England on
a visit in 1875. Towards the end of his stay, he
went down to Putney to bid farewell to an old
brother in indigent circumstances, whose ase and
poverty rendered their meeting again on this side
of Jordan an event not likely to happen. (As a
matter of fact, the brother afterwards went to
heaven direct from the workhouse). On returning
to London, his brother walked with him across
Putney Bridge to the Fulham side of the river, to
see him into a ’bus for the West-end, where he
was staying at an hotel. When close to the Middle-
sex end of the bridge, where there was a toll-gate
the rich man wished to say good-bye; but the poor
brother, anxious to see the last of him, wanted to
go as far as the ’bus. 44 No, no, William,” said the
other, 44 you go back and save the half-penny.’
And William went.
Mr. Booth, the Blue Ribbon Apostle, is
‘moving” society in Victoria. He is a sort of
moral aperient, scouring the conscience, and
purging bis disciples of their evil ways in the
direction of the revivifying nobbier and the ex-
hilarating pint. He has set the fashion anyway
and it is now a common thing to meet an erst
bibulous comrade strutting down the street with
his “ bit of blue ribbon ” pinned to his coat, as
proud of his decoration as any soldier of his rag.
All this is very well. We have nothing to say
against the efforts of these good people to stem
the tide of drunkenness, albeit we bethink us of
King Canute the Dane, and Mrs. Partington’s
mop. But there is something of a humiliating
character in these hysterical reforms. It doesn’t
improve one’s notions of human nature. Wo
cannot quote Shakespeare’s apostrophe—' 4 What a
piece of work is man ! How noble In reason !
How infinite in faculties I In form and moving,
how express and admirable ! In action, how like
an angel ; in apprehension, how like a god 1
when we see him strutting along with the badge
of reformation stuck in his button hole. Oh, no 1
We are rather disposed te think that man, taken

altogether, is a darned humbug, a big hypocrite*
an ass, and a pretender. As to his action in respect
to the blue-ribbon business, wo are Inclined to the
suspicion that the individual who can’t stave off
the jim-jams wittoutproclaiming from the house-
tops that he is one of the Blue Ribbon Army, is in
a bad way altogether. The matter is a piece of
vulgarity, savouring of the Stiggins’ morality and
the ethics of the conventicle. This is what their
poet says :—
“ A ribbon blue, I wear with pride,
Badge of regeneration;
Nor care I how old chums deride—
I'm on for reformation.
No longer cursed with burning thirst,
Yan Yean is now my tipple;
I find my rest on Nature’s breast,
And suckle from her nipple.
“ The devil, now, I do defy,
I yearn not for the nobbier;
For rum and milk no longer sigh,
I scorn e’en sherry cobbler.
If I feel queer, no longer beer
Seek I for reinstation,
But find in tea true remedy
And harmless medication.
4 Yet there are times, 1 own with shame,
Old Adam plagues me sadly—
When life doth seem a dreary game,
And thirst afflicts me badly;
When I would fain, ‘give it a name,’
Hoist in some stimulation,
’Tis then I find real strength of mind
In ribbon decoration.
“ Yes, yes, my ribbon blue I trust,
In Virtue’s ways confiding;
Badge of pure principles, I’ll 4 bust ’
E’er yielding to backsliding.
Then see in me, thou man of spree,
The fruits of reformation;
And join the band of glory, and
Blue Ribbon decoration.”
Yum! yum!

Speaking of poor Adam Lindsay Gordon,
a writer in a paper facetiously called Truth ob-
serves: “No buckjumper could move him, for so
long were his legs—he was a most unwieldy built
fellow—that he could cross ankles under the anl
fflal’s barrel.” Just before that par. was jerked,
me writer had evidently crossed his lips across the
Dung-hole of a cask.
People here wondered why the Engl’sh
journals, on receiving news of the Sydney Con-
ference, wrote as if Australian federation was
al most un fait accompli. They did not know till a
Queensland politician told them that “The Aus-
tralian colonies are not yet sufficiently advanced
for federation,” was wired to England with the
italicised words left out I—
Just two short words omitted—that is all.
Design or accident ? We fain would let
Others decide: ’tis ours but to recal
When last we heard those simple words, “ not
yet.”
A long and last farewell of native land;
A sigh—one passing pang of vain regret;
A fervid kiss, the press of a soft hand,
A whisper low, “Not yet, sweetheart, not yet.”
The scene is changed. Behold a surging mass
Of men and horses, dyed with bloody sweat;
A wav’rlng line—the dead lie thick as grass—
When through the smoke the word comes
“ Charge ?”—not yet.
But “dress the square.” We answer with a shout;
Again the column’s torn with shell, and wet
The sod’s with blood, while o’er the din rings out,
“ Steady the ranks, my lads—our time’s not yet ”
Life’s an amalgam strange of smiles and tears,
Love, hate, gain, glory, woman, wine—and debt—
But all it’s joys and woes, Its doubts and fears
Oft are compris’d in these two words “ not yet.”
We know the members—they would ne’er deceive
Their parent “Bull” (how strange, still, to
forget
Those words—a mere mistake, we may believe,
Some future dav, but-no-not yet, not yet.

There is in the northern territory a public
officer who, althoug h a gentleman and a fine fellow,
Is thoroughly imbued with a reverence for red tape.
The official in question—we ll call him X.Y.Z.—is
“ some pumpkins ” in the Telegraph Department.
Some time ago he was making his annual inspec-
tion of the line. On a plain as near in the middle
of Australia as possible, he called his leading man,
and said “ Brown, tell Smith and Robinson to
hurry up the pack-horses; at the next shackle,
half a mile from here, I’m going to speak with my
superior officer, Mr. Todd.” “ Your pocketinstru
ment is here, Mr, X.Y.Z.,” replied Brown. “ Do as
I tell you, sir,” replied the official. “Certainly,
sir.” And, in the blazing sun, on a parched
Spinifex desert, the packs were taken from
the horses, the men thinking the boss had
gone stark, staring mad. Selecting his own bag-
gage, X.Y.Z. opened his valise, and took from it a
dress coat, collar, and white waistcoat. These he
solemnly arrayed himself in, and then fixing his
instrument, transacted his business at the wire
This completed,he as solemnly robed himself again,
the packs were replaced, and the journey proceeded
with. After a ride of a couple of hours in dead
silence, the men more than ever convinced he was
mad, he volunteered the following to the private
ear of Brown:—“You thought it very strange of
mo, doubtless, Brown, dressing in the heart of
Australia; but I believe in examples. I had to
communicate with my superior officer, Mr. Todd,
and I wanted to show my subordinates the respect
with which I treat an officer to whom I’m sub-
ordinate.” Brown exploded.
The time was when the inhabitants of
Cairns lived in Arcadian simplicity when a man
with a coat on was hated as a * swell,” and
evening parties sat out on the verandahs and
picked the bones of oxen tea out of
billy-lids, and were happy and contented. The
time has gone by, however, when a Cairns man
could go and see his friend on a wet night bare-
footed, with his trousers rolled up to his knees (
his boots in one pocket and a quart of rum in the
other. “ No more, there is no more, so he says, to
carry rum for now,” as the Spanish Champion
observed on a previous melancholy occasion. The
Plantagenets have overrun Cairns, and invitations
to parties intimate that “ evening costumes ” are
expected. This sweeping and revolutionary in-
novation threw the old Cairns aristocracy on
their beam-ends, but some of them are men
equal to emergencies beneath which ordinary
people would lie down and howl with un-
bridled ferocity, or terrified despair. They
passed, In one agonising transition, from twill
shirt and tweed trousers to the complete panoply
in which the grocer's assistant and the local bank
clerk adorn the dress circle on transendant occa-
sions. One of them ordered an “ evening cos-
tume” to be sent up from a Brisbane tailor, and it
arrived in time for a party at the four-room and
skillion mansion of Raymond Berenger de Mont-
morency Tomtit But his absence from the party
was remarked, and in reply to a question of a
friend next day, he said ‘'Well, I intended to come,
but, hang me, if that ass of a tailor didn't send up a
coat with half the y tail cut off! ”

The following touching and really pathetic
legend is related to us by an amiable correspond-
ent residing in Cow-tree Gully. We have merely
taken the liberty of turning his good prose into
indifferent rhyme. And while on the subject, wo
don't mind letting you into an editorial secret, and
telling you that this exciting incident should have
appeared in these columns weeks ago. The fast
is we have some trouble with our poets. We en-
deavoured, some time since, to classify them. We
therefore rounded them up one morning, and
presented to each a silver number to hang upon
his watch-chain. But hero an unlooked-for dilli
culty at onco presented itsself. Not one of the

Lastweek, in a “plain English” article, we
inadvertently attributed to the Chief Justice, Sir
James Martin, a course of action with which he
really had nothing to do The Judge actually
responsible was District Court Judge Wilkinson.
As the proceedings we referred to have been
strongly animadverted on in Parliament and else-
where, it is proper that we should correct the
mistake.

A lot of reasons have been suggested why
the Poet Laureate has been made a peer, but we
have not seen in any newspaper that it was in con-
sequence of the pretty pieces ot poetry composed
by him to be put on the various statues, <sc, in
connection with the death of John Brown. Per-
haps the following verses from a London paper
may explain the reluctance with which Baron
Tennyson composed the verses referred to:—
THE RELUCTANT POET.
I’ve chanted of “ Albert the Good ” in words that
did credit to me,
And I’ve sung of a sea-king’s daughter who’d
little to do with the sea;
Now and then, too, I have penned an anthem to
open a show or bazaar.
But to sing of this fortunate Scotchman I think it
is going too far.
“He was always so good and so faithful as never
a servant has been.”
So good and so faithful—great heavens!—who
wouldn’t be kind to a queen ?
A monarch, ot course, may be sorry when such a
true servitor dies,
But, sure, ’tia a little too fulsome to praise him
like this to the skies!
With monuments, brasses, and verses, and texts
and beffiudings galore,
It’s <-nough to make Albert turn rusty, and even
dead Beaconsfleld sore.
Were you poor, or in exile and friendless, and
then he’d been faithful and kind—
But it alters the case not a little when he leaves,
say, six thousand behind!
Far better a personal servant than a servant of
state, it appears -
To hand out a queen from her carriage, than
guide the whole country for years 1
And it he was kindly to you, ma'am, to others he
was but a snob;
And although I suppose I must do it, I’m dashed
if 1 care for the job!

On the first day the brigade pledged their num-
bers, assuring a confiding pawnbroker that they
were the Order of the Billiard Cue just received
from King Kalakua. We redeemed those num-
bers several times; but, at length, wearying of
losing our credit by being continually seen, either
going in or coming out of a pawnbroker’s shop,
we informed the phalanx of poets that "it was the
last time.” That morning the whole of the
or aments—chaste design (an idea of “Hop-'s”—
he ought to reproduce it it he feels good) were
hypothecated as usual. We made no sign; and
“laughed consumedly.” But the demon still
pursued us. The “brigade’ 1 staggered by as
usual at its ordinary hour, and there happening to
be a run on poetry—elegiac, rustic, and idyllic—no
less than three boards were displayed against the
noble facade of the building. But the tuneful
“ push,” instead of making at once for the cellar,
merely trooped vacantly on, making no more sign
than we had. Then a thought flashed upon us !
Within twenty-four hours every poet had forgotten
his number! Under these painful circumstances
we consider we are entitled to some consideration
at the hands of a public which is as celebrated for
its extreme good nature as for its excessive
prowess in the tented oyster saloon. We have,
however, done our best in this trying position -
We have secured the services of a poetical young
glazier, who is under a contract to us, to turn out
a good sound article. With this we must be con-
tent until such a time as our regular poetical staff
shall have received, at our hands, that welcome at

Policeman Tim, he was a “ masher ”
(Take the name for what it’s worth),
Tlode a horse that was a slasher;
Stationed somewhere in the North,

Though ho was but a light weight, sirs,
Thunder 1 how he did the heavy.
Tim—this made the girls’ ears tingle
Till the lobes they had to rub—

Sweet strange maiden—hair quite golden,
Eyes of melting, melting blue—
Came up . . . story that is olden,
Olden as the story’s true! . . .
To fhe winds this trooper tossed all
Love for sweet Susanna Hooper;
“ Grubbed ” now at the other hostel,
Hostel quite had grown that trooper.
Where the stream goes singing, singing,
Where the twinkling swallow laps;
Where the girls are bringing, bringing,
Oftentimes, their willing chaps—
'Neath a willow tree they sang, sirs,
Cheek to cheek and eye to eye;
Suddenly there was a bang! sirs,
UifI and don’t the buttons fly!
Tim’s head flaps down in the mud,
Tim’s boots point tow ards the stars,
Broomstick comes another thud,
Arabesqued is Tim with scars!
Bolt upright there stands Susanna—
“Showed,” she cried, “ that I can fight;
Last, when treated in this manner,
T a sergeant killed outright.”
Fled now is that golden topper;
Gone’s Tim’s beauty ever more,
All day lies that wretched “copper,”
Friendless, sorry, sick and sore!
Town’s without its “police protection,”
Requested are the rowdy elves,
When there is an insurrection,
Kindly to arrest themselves!
MORAL.
True love all the world is gold love,
And this forget, now, never do—
Mind you’re quite off with the old love,
Bre you’re half on with the new!
The following- linos, scribbled on the back

Of live 'uns and stiff ’uns alike a maligner ;
A political Quilp and unscrupulous vulture.

Spurgeon’s well-known words, “Resist the
devil, and he will flee from you ; resist a deacon,
and ho will fly at you,” have been piteously quoted
by the Rev. J. H. Shalberg, In a letter to the Mel-
bourne Daily Telegraph. This gentleman, itwll
be remembered, was recently Invited to “come
on” by one of his pugilistic deacons, and in his
letter to the D.T. he begs to explain how it Is that
all these holy differences have arisen. The gist of
the Rev. S.’s remarks is that his sober ministry is
altogether too slow to please a Brunswick audi-
ence, and in a quiet sort of way this Baptist
parson coitninly contrives to “ get in ” one or two
ugly blows at the Harmy. Says the Rev. S.
“ Now, I’ve no objection to|beinga clown ; but if I
must be the caterer of amusement, I prefer to
divest myself first of the cloak of religion.” Un-
fortunately, though, lor the poor man, the deacons
have a strong leaning towards circus business in
religion. So, unless he is prepared to turn a double
somersault after giving out the text, we expect
he’ll have to find a fresh lot of sheep.

According to “ ’igh life ” gossip, the Duke
of Albany—although ho is now 81, and quite tall
for his ago—la not at liberty to accept any social
invitation or “self and missus” without first
obtaining a direct permission from his royal
mother. It makes things very awkward for
“Poldy” to be obliged to wire to mamma at
Balmoral, or goodness knows where, every time
that my Lord Smith asks him to drop in and smoke
a cigar, or Lady Smith begs of the youthful
Duchess to come round and see how well baby’s
getting on—but no doubt, everything’s for the
best. The Queen intends to keep this son straight,
anyway; and, as he is all right up to now, It is of
vital importance that he should bo guarded from
the snares of sucl - bad, bad people as were the
ruin of poor dear Teck. Besides, Leopold wants
watching quite as much for physical as for moral
reasons. The poor fellow not only bleeds pro-
fusely at the least shock to the system (the report
of a gun is very apt to set him off), but, worse
still, he is so awfully brittle that he breaks on the
slightest provocation. If he were to pay a visit to
one of those hail-fellow-well-met kind of country
squires, who slaps a man on the back as he en-
quires after his health, the inevitable result is
something too appalbng for loyal subjects too
contemplate.—
SOME ROYAL CORRESPONDENCE.
From D, of A. to Q. V a.
Dear Ma, I’ve been so long in town,
I'm feeling ill and weak.
And Lord de Browne invites me down
To Brownvllle for a week;
I’d like to go, 1 must confess,
I’ll be all circumspection—
Oh! do say “yes,” dear ma, unless
There’s any great objection.
From Q. V a to D. of A.
Dear son, of late, I’m grieved to state,
You seem to have, somehow,
A wanton wish to dissipate,
And that I can’t allow.
So write, you see, to Lord de B. —
Decline his invitation,
Then come to tea with Trlx and me,
And talk about salvation.
BRIEF MENTION.
The deplorable epidemic of “ criminal
assaults ” has reached a climax. A sexton is
charged now.
The Cobar people are petitioning Govern-
ment relative to the drought which they suffer

HER LOVE.
“ I love you fondly, sweet,” he cried,
“ To mo you are most dear.”
“ I’ll take you, for I love,” sh3 sigh’d,
“ That ‘thou.’ you earn a year.”
Rather too often, dear Maclean, do your
gaol subordinates put a wrong interpretation upon
judicial sentences, ordering female prisoners to be

we are outsiders.
STRANGE.
“ Though wedded we shall be to-day ;
Since courting we begun, sir,

A Dubbo duchess, who was recently “run
in ” for filling her tank too full of tangle, had over
£300 in notes and gold stowed away In her gentle

and we presume the constable who arrested her
will be promptly discharged for neglect of duty.
WHEN DOCTORS DIFFER ?
Of Stuart, sneers Brady:
“ His conduct is shady.”

Dawn breaks at last. After a lengthy
trial, a N.S.W. journal, the Annuity Banner, has
gained a libel notion. Cattlin, the local George
Robbins, sued for £200 damages for an article
alleged to have imputed perjury to him. And the
verdict, per jury, went against him. This, how-
ever, occurred in Albury.
“I don’t feel uneasy about the future
Erosperitylof any of my children, except Tom, and
e, poor fellow, seems a bit ‘ touched.’ His mind
is weak, and I fear that he will have to take to the
newspaper work and help his father.” That’s the
way the wife of a Southern editor gave the old
man away at a recent tea and twaddle party.
“ What a wide margin, ma, dear,” said the
daughter (attending high school) to her mother—
the keeper of a fashionable boarding-house—on
the entrance of a portly inmate. It was not until
the lady was making the rum sauce in the duff
later on, that she dropped down to the fact that
“ wide margin” is high school for “fat boarder.”
The patent fault of Matthew Davenport
Hill’s scheme for dealing with the habitual crimi-
nal. and which consists in keeping him in gaol
until he is cured, is that no fellow can tell when a
criminal in gaol is cured, since la gaol there is no
proper means of testing the strength of such good
resolutions as he may pour into the oar of the
chaplain.
A contemporary appears a trifle startled
because it is said that Judge Hoover, who once
unon a time was Chief Justice of Arizona, is now
chief waiter in arestamant in Southern California;
and Judge Satttrthwaite, also from Arizona, is
now doing tinker’s jobs for a living. We know
some Judges who have been tinkers all their life-
time, but we doubt if any of them are smart
enough to act as eaW waiters.

Professor Huxley has published the em-
phatic statement that in all his searching and ex-
tended studies of savage life in every end of the
earth he has found no people so miserable,
wretched, and degraded as those who exist in the
poorer quarters of London. Roll up, deahly

Sir Alfred Stephen would “scotch” the
snake young and kill it, for then, as he logically
puts it, the beggar wouldn’t be able to bite when
aged—a philosophical reflection, which makes us
regret ever so much that Sir Alfred himself wasn’t
treated tq this perfect cure when very young.
What a lot of judicial mistakes, pension money,
and expenditure on Stephenism generally his early
treatment by it would have saved our bleeding
country !
We are advised of a petrified body having
been exhumed somewhere alter a four years
burial. We have forgotten the particular spot
given, also the length to which tho hair had grown,
and whether the body looked like a perfect
statue. Auy of our readers anxieus for further
particulars may obtain them by exploring about
the deepest grave we are acquainted with—the
skull of the up-country editor who was stuck for
“ copy,” and who has sent the venerable yarn the
rounds of the exchanges.
The body of an old woman was found in
some water in an old clay hole in Brunswick, (V.)
How did she get in ? < his is how they solved the
mystery iu Melbourne last week:—Dr. Nei d: “She
wasn’t choked, she was drowned ” Dr. Murphy:
“ She wasn’t drowned, she was choked ” Dr.
Allen: “ She was only drowned” Dr. M'Kenna:
“ She was only choked.” Coroner: “ I’m inclined
to agree with Dr. Neild and Dr. Allen, an I’m also

Jury’s verdict: “ We got her dead.”
Fancy this, now. George Washington, tho
first President of the United States, never saw a
steamboat. John Adams, the second President ot
the United States, never saw a railroad. Andrew
Jaekson, the seventh President of the United
States, knew nothing about the telegraph; Abra-
ham Lincoln, the sixteenth President, never
dreamed of such a thing as a telephone. President
Garfield never rode in a Sydney tram; and Presi-
dent Arthur never heard of John Davies. And
yet those derned Yanks talk about keeping pace
with the age.
In view of the Supreme Court decision in
the test case, Larkins versus O’Conuel, all that
an enterprising Boniface has to do, in order to
fully avail himself of the benefits it accords him,
is to invest in a tent and a few benches, the
which erected on a spot convenient to his hostelry
will enable him on Christmas Day and Good
Friday to keep within the letter of the law, while
doing as he and his customers jolly well like with
its, his and their (sold on iho premises) spirit.
Their Honors the Judges evidently thoroughly
enjoy heaping contempt on the lex scripta.
A police-court “oath” has considerable
sanctity in the eyes of the Melbourne VVokld,
judging from a par. in a recent number of that
journal:—“ Iu a case against a Coolie man-servant
at the St. Kilda Court, to-day, there was no inter-
preter present, and another C <olie servant, who
chanced to be in the court, was pressed into the
service. He had but a bungling knowledge of
Englis*, and as the formality of swearing him was
dispensed with, there’ was no tellina whether he
interpreted truthfully or not.” Some people,
though, take a good many oaths without telling
the truth.
George Hayes, poor fellow ! suffered from
that most awful of afflictions, blindness, but kind
friends placed him iu the Melbourne Blind Asy-
lum, whence, after a long period of alternate
hoping and fearing, George was discharged cured
of his complaint. Rejoicing in the blessing of the
sight thus restored to him, George turned his
blessing to account in a manner of which few will
approve. In brief, he paid a visit to his old home,
the Asylum, and stole a quantity of clothing be-
longing to the blind inmates. And now he enjoys
the hospitality of an institution where the lodgers
are, mostly, very widc-iwake.
Sohool-inspeetor Jones’s recommendations
re schoolmarm Bard well were “ that she be in-
structed to be more punctual in her attendance,
to pay stricter attention to her printed instruc-
tions, and to raise her school to a higher degree of
efficiency.’’ The last recommendation strike hs as
being “rather of the ratherest.’’ It is as though
an inspecting general of artillery, finding a battery
in an undisciplined condition, were, instead of
suggesting the prompt removal of the officer in
charge, to recommend that he be instrucced to
raise his battery to a higher degree of efficiency—
as if the highest state of efficiency shouldn’t be a
battery’s normal condition.
“When doctors disagree, who shall de-
cide ?” A woman’s dead body was found in a
waterhole at Brunswick (Vic.), and “ a petticoat
was twisted round her neck and tightened at the
back, but was not tied.” So a post mo r tem was
made, and some very instructive evidence was the
result, two of the professional gentlemen deciding
that “there were no marks of any ligature round
the neck, and the cause of death was suffocation
from drowning, pure and simple,” while the third
expert (who assisted at the same examination)
found that “ there was a distinct black mark round
the neck, and the cause of death was strangulation
and not drowning.” Now, what can an Intelligent
jury make of all that ?
As they approached the settler’s humpy;
after a long and rough 40-mile ride—“I fancy,’’

’em sure enough, now, the cattle-shaking villains.
You knock at the doore sur, while Ishurround the

and the “ missus ” busy helping her husband and
the children to a second round of damper and
honey; so after a thorough search the twain
departed, the foiled “trap” remarking, as he
tightened his belt, and let fall his lower lip, “ not
as much sign o’ mate, or graice itself, as wud
atthract a blow-fly, Bedad 1”
Ora pro nobis. We have received No. 2 of
a paper published in Melbourne. It is a “ Society”
paper, and we have the assurance of the pro-
prietors that they know how these things are run.
We know where they run to, and regret that space
prevents our quoting largely from it, for our own
instruction. We cannot, however, resist the
opportunity of catching its fleeting breath, and
brightening up our own pages with a few little
ger.«.s of Personal items set everyone in
aroar, See how it sparkles “ Who is the new
barmaid at Tomkins’, on the Hill, who knocks the
mashers? Johnny Matlock’s genial face looks
well behind a bar. Why does Jim Kent absent
himself from the baker’s shop in Gcrtrude-street,
Fitzroy ? ”
The Wagga Stab says:—“Mr. Eaton
promised to give two hogsheads of beer towards
the celebration of the opening of the bridge for
free traffic. This generous off er it has been found
expedient to decline, and in its stead Mr. Katon
has donated two guineas.” Mr. Eaton is a brewer.
We suppose he means his donation of two guineas
to be an equivalent for the proposed two hogs-
heads of beer. If so, we get 20s. as the value of a
hogshead (or 54 gallons or 432 pints) of beer. At
3d. a pint, a hogshead of Eaton’s swill yields to the
retailer £5 8s. There must be profit in selling the
stuff. The celebration committee should have
accepted the beer and retailed it. The old bridge
proprietary would have jumped at such a chance
had anyone offered them two hogsheads of she-oak.
This is the way the census collectors make
their labour light up Northwards;—In order to
find out how many children a town contains, a
Punch and Judy show is started in the main
street, and while collector No. 1 goes through the
tragedy, No. 2 counts up the youngsters. To
secure the female total, a report is spread that a
fashionable wedding is to be held on a certain date
at the local church, and then the only trouble is to
select the real townswomen from the inquisitive
ladies who have ridden ten or twenty miles to see
the execution. To reckon the male proportion,
all that is necessary to do is to anchor a tank of
beer in the public square and festoon its sides with
pint-pots. And it is thus that an irksome business
is converted into quite a cheerful picnic-sort of
ceremony.
One of the greatest essayists of Hunter-
street says “ It is surprising how soon a wife
tires of the company of a man who is too much at
home. Men are wise in getting away from their
own roof-trees a certain portion of each day.”
We have always contended for this right on behalf
of woman, and on more than one occasion been
touched on noting her inflexible determination to
have a little quiet time to herself when the hus-
band has come at 8 in the morning, and fallen to
sleep on the doorstep rather than ring her up. But
when a man gets to fixing himself up to his own
roof-tree, we cannot wonder that ai loving wife
thinks things are really getting too domestic, and
that she might be excused for a little haste when
she has to go around to the painter’s and norrow a
ladder so as to get up and cut him down.
In the month of February there were
2833 oz. of spirits medicinally dispensed in the
Melbourne Hospital. Of the eight medical men,
two shone out with an engaging liberality, and
two look to have been shrunk up into the
dimensions of a blue-ribbon medal. Dr. Fulton
and Dr. Moloney gave at the rate of 10 oz. per
patient, while Dr. Robertson and Mr. Girdlestone
thought they did it handsomely by ordering a
solitary oz. to the unfortunates The Hospital
report does not enable one to judge accurately as
to which brace of doctors coffined most. To make
the table serve any but a financial purpose, a
column dealing with this should be appended. In
the meantime, prospective patients are naturally
anxious to get on the list with tne first brace, i f
they are to be killed anywhere about as certainly
«s on the other list, they will have the advantage
of getting it done in an eminently more pleasant
way.
Boniface Chetwynd, of the Clarendon,
Surry Hills, with reference to the fiscal policy of
the Government, the high rentals in the suburbs,
and similar matters, observes that “ in any respect-
able locality a house cannot be rented much under
£1 per week, and the chances are that the occupant
has a wife and family, and only earning £2a week.
How, therefore, can he afford to pay 6d. for a glass
of beer, and keep his family respectable ?” How,
indeed ? Chetwynd s contention is that the ab-
sentee should be taxed, and beer untaxed; but we
don’t toe how that would very materially better
the position of the man (with a family) living in a
house costing him 20s. a week for rent, and only
earning 40s. Such a man's chances of keeping his
family respectable and avoiding insolvency would
not lay so much in beer untaxed as in beer un-
“ ax ”cd for by him under any circumstances.
What playful “bhoys” there are down
Tumut way ! We are told on the authority of the
Qxtndagai Elwortiiv that three festive huro-
pi a <s recently visited the Chinese garden at
Go, up—wherever that may be—on a melon-h mt-
mg expedition. They struck a rich patch, ami
helped themsc Ives plentifully to the choicest fruit.
They had setMed down to a good tuck-in when the
proprietor blandly hinted at compensation. That
was the signal for a general onslaught on the
heathen. They tickled him in the ribs with a
three-pronged fork, butted him over the head
with a shovel, fanned his brow with a paling, and
wound up the caruiv u l by defiling his bed and
wrecking his habitation. Av coorso the police re-
saved information of the occurrence some time
afterwards, and arc prowling round on the look
out for the “ bhoys, and praying to God not to
find them.
The City of the South has had to suffer on
many occasions. The vandalism of the elements

the Bench in the District Court sealed the fate of
metropolitan tripe. Henry Cornwell used to boil
it in Lonsdale-street. He used to put it in a wooden
vat outside in his back-yard, and the steam used
to curl over the tall roofs, and the liquor run off
into Leichhard t-street, and wend its way through
the gutters to the ever-restless sea. Dr. Fisher
came there to speak for his doomed favourite.
■“ I smelled the vat,” said the doctor, “and it was
sweet: 1 smelled the liquor, and it was sweet also;
I smelled the gutter, and the aroma made my teeth
water; you can go and smell the sea yourselves.”
But the Bench said “Tripe mustn’t be boiled in
the town, never no more,” and fined Cornwell 10s.,
with £3 3s. costs.
Here they come at last. Better late than
never. A young lady in the Orange district was
returning home a few days ago, when she suddenly
found her progress hampered by the presence of
an enormous tiger snake which lay stretched
across the road, and merely winked familiarly at
her when requested to reef in his tail and let the
lady pass. Not being able to jump over the lazy
reptile, the Orange girl belted him over the back
with a pole, and on his snakeship being bpened it
was found he had recently swallowed a full-grown
native cat, which bore the appearance of being
rather inconveniently crowded up for room. Just
before this, a farmer near Tarana explored the
head of another boomer with a hay-fork, and on
searching the reptile, which measured six feet, no
less than 04 baby snakes, from 9 to 13 Inches long,
were found cuddled up together, and wondering
what in thunder was the cause of all the row out-
side. So that the Tarana six-footer had something
like 60ft. of snakes stowed away inside her. And
there's another story told of a Grafton girl, who
finding a carpet snake on the road as she was going
to church, despatched the varmint by poking her
30-rib gingham down its throat, and suddenly
opening it out before Eve’s seducer had time to
get himself expanded.
Some of the newspaper offices in the South
are preaching a deadly cru«ade against the adul-
teration of milk This is encouraging. The
Goughs and the Cooks and the Barkers have not
worked in vain. Instead of cogging the “stick ”
up with a match-box or a plug of tobacco while
he was running round the corner, the typo now
reaches over for the milk-jug and wets. And the
leader writer is never “ off his chump ” now, and
the scissors man declares he has twice the strength
in his elbow, and proves it by pointing to the
great big columns he is able to shear out of the
home papers. The adulteration of this precious
fluid is. therefore, a subject on which the Southern
journalist is justified in waxing wroth. And he is
waxing away. But until the crusade eventuates
in a might victory for the pen, the Federal, Aus-
tralian enjoins circumspection and care. “ Boil
your liquid,” it says, “ and skim the surface off.
and the milk will be completely purified from all
poisonous germs.” Not alone to the pressmen of
Victoria, but to every unit in the population of
Australia this advice should be of momentous
value. And it can be depended on, for the Fede-
ral is a grand authority on skim-milk, a very
grand authority, Indeed ; and is not bad on any
sort of a skim, not at all bad.
If we were not raking it in hand over fist
by writing, we should certainly turn dentists or
corn doctors. It requires no training and the
meanest intellect is capable of counting over the
fee, which is the chief thing. All you want is a
ground floor, a bowl with a hole in the bottom,
and a gilt sign, with the word surgeon-dentist, or
corn-doctor, on it. You can then wrench away at
the public jaws, slash away at their feet, or drop
an occasional tooth into the patient’s larynx, or
suffocate him with nitrous oxide, and it only
advertises your business Then there is the new
tooth business, where for £10 you fltma frame-
work that feels like a cord of wood in the mouth,
and that never drops out except when you are in
company, and want to laugh. The Board of Tech-
nical Education have done wisely to advertise for
a lecturer on this useful branch of science, and we
now look forward to the early establishment of a
lectureship on corn-cutting, to keep pace with the
late advances in the art of making sharp-toed
boots that place the toes one on top of another.
It is in this latter regard that we droop away into
pensive melancholy as we reflect that one who was
late amongst us, but who has passed from our
midst, is not with us to advise in this hour of trial.
But he will come again Let but three short
circling years flit by, leaving,* in their hurried
flight, the vanishing molar, or building up the
bunions of an honourable maturity, as our corn
and whine increase, and then the doors of Pen-
tridge will be flung wide open, and our own Indan
be at us again—literally tooth and nail.

lips to speak I
“ I’m going now, I’m going now, and this is all I
to you—
This thing called Life is never worth the while
of man to live;
And if hereafter I am asked to come and give a
day to you,
I’m d —d if I’ll return again for all the earth
can give!”
His initials are “H.F...” but we don’t kneyv
what his naiqp is. It might be Horace Evremonfie
or Henry Bmptlsm—anything, in fact; but. be-
yond the f>;ct that he is a bard and that he resides
at Cootamundra, we . know nothing ivhatever
about him. It seems that things are so disorgap-
ised there—possibly owing to the departure of
Murdoch-that the Cootamundrians resolved to
elect a vigilance committee, regardless of the
feelings of the mounted police, whose top-boms
are found to no longer strike awe into the hearts of
evil-doers, it seems to such a state does anarchy
reign, that no one ever goes through the farce of
putting out his milk-jug, while peremptory offers
to join tne choir are continually emanating from
a large number of undesirable personages. Under
these circumstances the citizens met, and this
gathering is celebrated by " H.E.” (who is an
advocate for “ new blood ”) in immortal verse.
See with what tact and skill the poet marshals his
townsmen before him in solemn review! Of the
blacksmith he says —
“ Ho shod the gallant steed or made the plough,
And as he worked he sang (or made a jolly row.”)
Here, at once, you got fact and fancy, with an
under current of satire that must have caused as
much amusement to the Cootamundrians as the
“Afternoon” did to the friends of Mr. Peter
Magnus. Nor are the clergy forgotten—
And passing gravely through the mingled throng
John Miller comes, Bishop of Ironbung.”
We hope there is nothing irreverent in this: but
we have a shrewd suspicion that our bard has that
sarcastic spirit within him born of leading sec-
tarian papers! The watchmaker has a good show
in finely-balanced couplets:—
“ And by his side young ETowell now appears,
A man of many watches for his years;
And when the love-sick swain his girl would
treat.
Thera’s not a better shop than Howell’s in Parker-
street.”
Plenty of fire here, eh ? But, perhaps it is In
dialogue where “ H K.” the more brilliantly excels.
The jeweller speaks :—
“ Unaccustomed as I am
To public speaking, 1 can only claim
Your kind indulgence. But I thank those gents
\v hose votes have placed me on the Vigilance.”
We like this ingenious dovetailing in of a familiar
and |time-honoured expression. It is homely and
beany ; and consequently exceedingly pleasing.
Of the editor of the Cootamundka Liberal, we
then get—
“ Another champion joins the thickening fight,
The learned Doidge, who said, ‘ It isn’t right.
To heap such insults on the ga llant seven,
Whom I conceive to be most proper men.’ ” [111]
Everybody, indeed, seems to have been noticed,
except the seston. Hang it, though! Perhaps the
bard’s the sexton.

The Alta California says, “Stripped,

What a chance for a sporting parson!
Disparaging personal remarks have lately
been made by some of our loading cricketers anent
a new professional. In the fatherland of cricket,
a promising colt, no matter who or what he is, is
treated kindly by the foremost gentlemen players.
The caddish members of our cricket clubs might
well take a lesson from the Britishers.

New Zealand is Donald Dinnie mad. Two
lads at Waikouaiti named Affleck and Fell, who
had a wrestling bout, carno out of it—one with a
broken arm and the other with a broken collar-
bone; while a young man named Wise, working
on Orbell's run, who was also Indulging in a
wrestling encounter, had two of his ribs broken.
It is not often a bicycle rider gets whipped
up the straight. At Geelong (Vic.) H. Stokes,
riding a very light luviacible, was Pterally lashed
upon the back, at every revolution of the wheel,
owing to several of the very light spokes in his
machine having given way, and in swinging
round, descended with very considerable force
upon his—back, causing him to retire from the
race.
The Sydney Amateur Sailing Club has de-
cided upon the fo/lowing definition of an amateur:
“The word amateur shall exclude all fishermen,
oystermen, sailmakers, bontbuilders, or persons
gaining or having gained their living on the water,
any person who is or has been employed in or about
yachts, boats, or ships, as a means of livelihood, or
any person who has received a monetary consider-
ation for his prolessional knowledge.
Wallace Ross, upon his arrival in England
was mistaken for a dynamiter. His reception at
Liverpool was somewhat amusing, as it was not
long before he perceived that he was regarded
with no small amount of suspicion on the part of
the authorities, the long coffin-like box enclosing
his Ruddiek-bulit boat attracting the attention of
tue Custom House officers, who were inclined to
be inquisitive, and were not satisfied until the lid
was wrenched open.
“A Lancashire Lad” asks our opinion as
which is the fastest ped , Malone or Hutchens,
the Englishman who recently covered 300 yards in
even time. AVe are not in a position to give an
opinion. No line can bo taken from times, which
are taken in such a loose manner in Australia, as
instanced by the fact that 150 yard races, alleged
to be run in evens, are becoming quite common
throughout the country; and 10-see. 100-yardors
are as plentiful as gaol birds or C.M.G.’s.
One of the most extraordinary features of
the late V.R.C. meeting was the backing of Dirk
Hatteralek down to 5 to 4 for the Bourke Handi-
cap. After some of the horse’s recent perform-
ances, this was a little bit puzzling to the guileless
public, and considerable satisfaction was expressed
at his defeat. For good looks, though, there was
nothing to beat the Cup “dream” in the paddock,
and he certainly looxed the very stamp of animal
to pull off a seven furlong scramble.
THE “CHAMPION.”
Quite close to my side, as the horses swept by
For the canter, sat sweet little Nancy,
And she said with a mischievous gleam in her eye,
“ Well, Charley, and who do youfancy?”
“ I fancy but one." “ Pray, who is that one ?”
(Here her voice had the prettiest falter)
“I’d like to ‘stand’ with you, for once, just for j
fun
“ So, darling, you shall—at the altar.”
Mr Frank Gulston, the famous English
amateur sculler, who was supposed to have been
drowned some time ago, has re-appoared. He be-
came involved in speculations and lost a fortune.
Instead of being drowned he went to Grimsby and
engaged himself on a smack as a deck-hand He
toiled in this capacity untii recently, when he was
discovered by some of his friends, who set to work
to better his circumstances. Fifteen hundred
pounds was soon subscribed, to bo devoted to a
superior fishing vessel. The Baroness Burdett-
Coutts has taken a groat interest in Gulston.
About a couple of months ago the English
Sporting Mirror for November devoted six
pages to a portrait and biographical sketch of
this famous amateur.
Hosmer, the sculler, defeated Meagher for
their ten mile walk, in which the champion had to
concede Hosmer BOO yards' start. To all appear-
ances both men walked square, and Hosmer
showed a good turn of speed. Meagher could only
gain one-third of the handicap on Hosmer uuring
the first three miles, and afterwards, being taken
sick, retired from the contest after doing five
miles and three quarters. Hosmer walked seven
miles and was awarded the stakes. No time was
taken. Hosmer challenges any pedestrian in the
United States or Canada, Meagher barred, to walk
a distance of ten miles for a reasonable amount of
money. If a race is made it will be his last, as he
intends to retire from the pedestrian business.
The second day of the V.R.C. Autumn
meeting opened with the second Hurdle Race,
which fell lo Yately by a neck from Acrobat, Don
Alonzo third; The Broker madean easy win of the
V.RC. (Sires’) Produce Stakes, Manfred second,
Sirocco third; Don Quixote won the Corinthian
Cup as he liked from Tno Joker, Boisterous third;
Morpeth justified the confidence placed in him by
romping home a length ahead of Sweet William
for the Australian Cup, Le Grand, a similar dis-
tance away, third; Lizette won the Steeplechase,
two lengths away from Jack Scandal, Go-
vernor third; and Soldier Boy finished the
day’s sport by appropriating the Bourke Handi-
cap, Claptrap, a couple of lengths away, second,
and Fryingoan third. The last day of the meeting
commenced with the Maiden Stakes, which fell to
Vergy, Yernet second, Boscawen third ; Rufus
carried off the Nursery Handicap, after a good
flutter with Xantippe, Vemtia third ; Little Sister
defeated Here's Luck for the Vutumn Handicap,
Linda third ; the unthought-of Le Grand annexed
the Champion Stakes, Off Colour second, Commo-
tion third, the big gun, Martini-Henry, finishing
nearly last; Bargo won the All-aged Stakes by a
good length from Brown and Bose, Fryingpan
third ; and Le«bia carried oft the Free Handicap,
two lengths ahead of Don Quixote, Odd Trick
third.
We clip the following account of the Hud-
son-Dimaie match from a N.Z. weekly:—“The
wrestling match, which has been for some time
pending* between W, Hudson and Donald Dinnie,
was decided in the Lyceum Hall, Dunedin, on
j Saturday evening, in the presence of a crowded
house. The conditions were that the best of three
falls should be wrestled in five different styles,
and Hudson was accorded choice of three. The
stakes were £150. The local man selected the
Border, ‘Huggie,’ and Cornish styles, and Dinnie s
choice was the Scotch and Grmco-Roman styles, in
both of which his strength and weight give hint a
distinct superiority over his opponent, most of the
wrestling being done on the ground. Hudson won
the Border nn<i ‘Huggie’ bouts, and Dinnie, not
without considerable trouble, worsted his oppon-
ent in the two styles chosen by himself. The Cor-
nish style came last, and alihougb it was Hudson’s
own choice, t>o proved to have rather the worst of
it. Weight again told, and Dinnie threw him re-
peatedly after a lot of pretty play, but never fairly
on his back. On one of these occasions Hudson
was thrown off the padded part of the stage, and
cut his knee. At length Dinnie scored one fall,
but in the next the men got a close hold, and
Hudson very cleverely “ hanked his opponent,”
amidst great applause. The final fall went, how-
ever, to Dinnie. who managed to get a fair under-
hold, and threw his man cleverly, thus winning
the match by three points to two. The match
was thus not decided till the very last fall, of
which there were altogether twelve.”
Mr. Langridge, the Victorian Commis-
sioner of Customs, would scarcely seem to come
under the definition of “ an all-round sportsman.”
A deputation from the Anglers’ Protection
Society waited upon Mr. L. the other day, respect-
ing the illegal slaughter of fish by netting, shoot-
ing, &c., and this gentleman waxed somewhat
merry at the deputation’s expense. The notion of
shooting trout, for instance, struck the Commis-
sioner of Customs as being particularly odd; he
had never seen a fish shot, he observed, and didn’t
suppose that anyone present had witnessed such a
phenomenon. Then, with a roguish eye, he went
on to state that “ some of the letteis no received
on the subject of fish protection looked really
absurd. For instance, he had before him a com-
plaint that fish were illegally caught by tickling”
(laughter.) The Commissioner was more tickled
than the fish at this last joke, and knowingly
remarked that “ tickling a fish would be a day’s
work.” Now, if he had ever chanced to see some
fine, fat trout being jerked out of a shallow stream
at spawning time, by this said process of tickling,
he wouldn’t have delivered himself of such bosh.
But, after all, Mr. Langridge appears to be quite as
well up in piscatorial matters as the Melbourne
Herald, which informs us—“ We always thought
that the operation of catching trout by tickling
was a mere sarcasm on anglers, but we live and
learn.” This is an unusually modest admission
from the Herald, but its verdancy is enough to
make Izaak Walton turn in his honoured grave.

In England, eleven persons arrested at a
prize-fight were fined £5 and bound over to keep
the peace for twelve months Billiard handicaps
are all the rage in England now. A team has been
organised to do the provinces, consisting of junior
J. Roberts, W. Mitehell, T. Taylor, Shorter, North,
G. Collins, F. White, and H. Coles A curious
incident occurred during the first day of the recent
Scarborough (Eng:) coursing meeting. While Dr.
Bennett’s Gov’nor was driving his hare through a
fence a hawk was flying by, which the dog caught
and killed. Instantly dropping his strange quarry,
he went on contesting the trial, which he ultimately
won, finishing up by killing his hare ...It is ru-
moured that a professional single scull handicap
race, three miles with turn, will take place at the
Point of Pines, near Boston, next summer. The
following handicaps have already been suggested:
—Hanlan, scratch; Teemer, Hosmer, Ross. Hamm,
and Conley, 10 sec.; Leo, 15 sec ; and Courtney,
Kennedy, Ten Eyck, Elliott, Gaiscl, and others,
30 sec. and upwards. An attractive move this

Broken bones at football matches are common
enough, but they are mostly the result of colli-
sions or falls upon the hard ground. However, at
Whitchurch (Salop), the other day, during a match
between two local clubs, a young man named
Cartwright was struck with great force by the
ball, kicked by the opposition captain, doubling
up his hand and breaking his arm midway between
i.he wrist and the elbow.... An Indian paper states
that it is rumoured that in consequence of the
scarcity of horses in England suitable for army-
purposes, the Home Government has directed
Veterinary Surgeon Appleton to proceed to Aus-
tralia and purchase Australian-bred horses, which
will be sent Home in troop ships.
Madame Marie Roze-Mapleson is, perhaps,
so far as personal appearance goes, the most fas-
cinating of all the great prime donne— no vulgar
English for us when we canjchip in with a slab of
a foreign language—and Longfellow particularly
admired her. The old boy should have stopped
there; but he wrote her poetry. Here is a little
bit of it: —
“ . . we, enchanted by thy grace,
And loot in worshipping
The magic of thy form and face,
Forget to hear thee sing.
“ Or, if wo listen to the strain
That, like a bubbling brook,
OTeflows thy lips in music, then
We all forget to look!”
This would be very good poetry for the Evening
News, but it is not very good for Longfellow.
The idea, however, is pretty. How, now, if ap-
plied to—let’s see; who’s away? Oh!—Soldene.
We’ll try it, as the drawing-room vocalists say
before commencing the torture :—
We were so frightened at that cave,
As out the notes did ring,
We prayed the Fates too hard to save,
To even hearthco sing!
When silent; lo, we could not see
Ttwe, then, it did arrive;
We thanked those Fates so earnestly
To find we were alive!
We suppose there are certain snuffy hypercrities
who would prefer Longfellow’s verse to ours! We
like ours best. We consider it is the more adapted
of the two to the understanding of legislators,
whoso elevated and patriotic principles chiefly
take the form of beer. But if you would like
something high-strung you can have it. We should
like just to listen to the rhythm of the Alolian
harp, as it Is fanned by the gentle breezes of the
tropic sea. And we don’t mind letting you into a
secret. We have tried to purchase, with lawful
currency, an ASolian harp, but have failed. And
this reminds us—we are writing this on Sunday,
while the potatoes are comfortably browning
under the baked shoulder—that we must have our
little joke. On one occasion we sent our chartered
aid—a real Randwick success. If she only wouldn’t
sniff so—down town for, with a verbal message, an
AColian harp, to a famous importer’s This was
the answer we got back, under a beautifully-
printed heading, and in gorgeous round text—
“We have no linoleum, ‘ harp pattern.’ ”
Lacking the inspiration which even a cheap A3.H.
(let’s be brief) [Yes; please.— Ed. B.] could afford,
you must take these heroics in the rough. We
will, after much anxious thought, and an interval
of juvenile boat-cleaning, entitle them—
The Great Defeated.
The blow has fallen, oh, alas on him ;
Yet who could say that eye-glass, e’en, was dim ?
Who dare say lowered was that haughty crest
Who dare say panting was that gallant breast?
Beaten, this Great Soul, it does befall,
He does not curse, but cries “ God bless you all.”
And now we beg to move the adjournment of the
House during the refreshment hour. The mutton ■
a shrill voice informs us, is just ready,
J. M‘Donald, late postmaster and tele-
graphist at Omeo (Vic.), has been dabbling with
Government money, and is now enjoying the
magnificent apartments and luxurious fare pro-
vided in Pentridge for those who mistake other
people’s money for their own. Mac. w<as a guile-
less youth some five years ago when he first struck
Omeo, but the air or the whisky or the society, or
perhaps a combination of the lot, demoralised
bim. Hence his present trouble. A year in Omeo
would demoralise a saint. We were in Omeo one
time, but we didn’t stay there a year. Neither
were we a saint, which, perhaps, may account for
our unblemished character, our spotless life, and—
[This is getting egotistical. If you’ve got any-
thing more to say about Omeo, let’s have It —Ed.
B.l When we were In Omeo, prosperity seemed to
have planted her foot right down in that town-
ship. The sluicers had struck good patches of
gold in the creeks, the corn was waving iresh and
green on the adjacent plains: the sheep and cattle
were rolling fat on the hillsides; the Chinese camp
was in full swing with Its opium dens, gambling
shops, Joss houses, sly grog shanties, and other
etceteras; and the two licensed houses, called by
way of courtesy “hotels,” were doing- a roaring
trade in mixed liquors. Reckless assertions
had been made by ungenerous persons that
Omeo was one of the last places included
in the general scheme of creation, and that
Providence had neither the time, material, nor
inclination to finish It. We are not prepared to
contradict the statement, bat are free to confess
that the conformation of the district Is rugged,
and the inhabitants bucolic in the extreme. Sepa-
rated, as they are, from the outside world by steep
mountain ranges and almost impassible ravines,
they are primitive in their habits, and dress as
fancy dictates, rather than c nform to the hard and
fast rules of fashion; and it were needless to add
that temperance societies did not flourish there
like the green bay tree. Quite the opposite. Some-
times a feeble attempt would be made to resusci-
tate the sons of Rachab when the banker had had a
long spell of the blue devils, and the doctor coulu
not pull him through owing to a defective vision
or disordered brain, brought about by the strength
of the rum and whisky, most of which was im-
ported from the adjacent ranges. Religion was, as
may be supposed, an almost unknown quantity,
the only sample of it they had on hand was sup-
plied by a dissenting preacher, who scarcely knew
enough to start a country Sunday school. But the
leading feature of Omeo was Its local paper—the
Echo of the Mountains, a weekly sheet of com-
posite build and unique architecture. It was a go-
as-you-please kind of unreliable In its gene-
ral Intelligence, irrearular of issue, and limited
in circulation. It’s size was that of an average
porous plaster, and judging by the orthography it
became painfully evident that the editor spelled
by ear. Old Saunders—as he was generally called
—was editor and proprietor, and, with the excep-
tion of a small boy, the whole staff. He was a man
of medium build, and had a capacity for raw
spirits even ahead of a Rum reporter. He could
hold as much, without spilling it, as would start a
small wholesale spirit store, and when he had im-
bibed a skin-full of the fury compounds retailed
by the local whisky vendors, he used to become
argumentative and demonstrative in a marked
degree. Under these circumstances, he would
open controversies with any person who happened
round, from the Chinese fossicker to the local
member for the mining board. And he never
was very choice in his subjects for discussion, nor
the diction which he used in the argument. He
would deliver himself of strengthy Anglo-Saxon
that would bring a blush to the cheek of a horse-
trooper, and if that failed, he would challenge his
opponent to mortal combat with the confidence of
a Heenan in his destructive powers. He was a
hardy old rooster, and never was too particular
about his bed. He would sleep on the track that
did duty as main street from the township
to the Chinese camp, with a chunk of quartz for a
pillow, whilst his other extremities were washed
t>y the murmuring gutter. But he would rest
there as peacefully as an infant in a cradle, never
dreaming for a moment that a big section of the
subscribers to the Up Gulch Snorter-ss the
“boys” facetiously called the sheet, in imitation
of a Yankee conceit—were languishing lor their
weekly supply of useful and entertaining intelli-
gence. But there is an end to all things. Not-
withstanding his almost cast-iron constitution and
mental vigour, ho was unable to withstand the
undermining effects of the tanglefoot, and joined
the great majority just as the last echo from J;ia

Many years ago a silk-weaver emigrated
from England to Canterbury, N. Z. He was very
poor, and shortly after reaching the colony he was
seized with a dangerous illness, and the doctors
all s iid he would din as sure as his name was
William White. William, however, recovered in
spite of them, and straightway received the
soubriquet of “ Resurrection White.” The
Waitmakariri, a river more formidable even then
its name, must be bridged, and after repeated
failures on the part of engineers and contractors
White undertook to bridge it, bridged it accord-
ingly, and became “ Waitmakariri White.” Fortune
now smiled sweetly on Willie, and he built a large
hotel at Kv.iapoi and became “ Kaiaooi White.
He leased stone quarries from the Government,
built a tramway, and Macadam’s brigade of stone-
breakers henceforth swore by him as ‘‘Tramway
White.” He bought several extensive properties
in and around Christchurch, and among others a
fine new hotel, next to the offiee of the Lyttelton
Times, ever since known as “ White’s Commercial
Hotel.” Last of all, bo took the conti act for the
railway bridge across the Kakala river, over
which the trains were soon running between Dun-
»d(n and Christchurch. This bridge is two miles
in length, and is the last of the old silk-weave, s
public works. He has now retired from business
with a fortune, and his son William White, junior.
Member of the New Zealand Parliament for
Sydenham, carries on the contracting business
worthily in his stead.
The sturdy theologians of the have
drawn off somewhat from teaching piety, and
have turned their attention to the carnal theme
of the body. Here's what the ex-fathers gave last
week, as a prescription for living long“Preserve
under all circumstances a composure of mind
which no happiness, no misfmtune, can too much
disturb. Love nothing too violently; hate nothing
too passionately; fear nothing too strongly.” As
we are about entering on our hundredth year, and
have long ceased to enter into discussions with
theologians, wo content ourselves with a lew brief
words of advice drawn from our own experience.
We but state as hints what we have ourselves
tested. First, arrange what universe you shad be
born into, and bo careful in the selection of your
planet. If you elect the earth don’t be born near
Ischia or Sunda. Having fixed next on your
nationality, so as to avoid Paganism or Ireland,
decide on a line of forefathers who have had no
taint of scrofula, nervous ailments, or love of
alcohol; stipulate for the minimum of stature
you will accept, colour of hair, and general expres-
sion of countenance. Your social position you
needn’t arrange for, as you are coming into a
world where merit is the passport to everything
good. Having secured a suitable father and
mother, get bom at a favourable date. For your
physical well-being, at once see to it that your
nurse is healthy and attentive, and your feeding
bottle kept scrupulously clean. See that you are
taken out for regular airings, and, when you are
of school age, refuse to enter an unventilated
school-house, or to listen to any teacher whom
you know to be a fool. Don’t wish for jam nor
holidays, and on no account be late for Sunday
school. Later on, don't “ love passionately ’ any
young woman, hate passionately your father’s
murderer, be “ disturbed ” by being defrauded by
scoundrels, or in any way put out by seeing your
children dying or in want. If fraud and barefaced
hypocrisy and malignity destroy your best
prospects, or blast your character, or if accident
deprive you of your sight or hearing, say it’s all
right. But, above everything, keep cool—very
cool. It’s neither wholesome nor respectable to
be agitated. And then, when you are eighty years
old, and know that you have let nothing “disturb”
you, calculate on running up to the hundred, and
leaving behind a few texts for the Mail on how
long life is to be attained. You will infallibly
attain it by following the course we have
mapped out. But start early. Reconstruct
the universe first, and everything will bo right.
’Ti« sweet to see that we may occasionally
range beyond our own staff for a few youths who
are nourishing a youth sublime with the cheery
and lucrative pursuit of poetry. It is true that
our own trusty bards have had to fall in with the
traditions of the office, and respect a popular
prejudice in favour of having an idea, and of
versification that doesn’t give the dentist too big a
“throw in.” But we move with the times, and
see no reason why “ Poeta ” of Gordon shouldn’t
make a dash for immortality-should prefer that,
he got it, in fact, early and tragically. By the eye
of faith, we see the first flush of the dawn over
the unnamed Parnassus of Gordon. Through the
wail of the forest we hear the scrunching of a
cross-cut saw; and by intuition we know that old
man “Poeta” is at one end of it. cheered on by
young P., who sits on the end of the log with the
billy in one hand and this screed in the other. He
sings:—
“ If I was a poet gifted,
I’d have the world like barley sifted,
And poets kept apart from sinners;
But kick to all new beginners.”
A f ter this suicidal outburst and calling “time”
to the old man who had stopped to grease his saw,
he sends forth concerning our other successful
bards:—
“ Some of their heads are hard and hollow,
And from the dead their verses borrow.”
Which arc two points scored in his upward flight
to fame. He knows how to draw from within
consolation as the poetic type of head Gordon can
furnish, and, from without, the source of his in-
spiration. Now he has another pull at the billy,,
tunes his throat, and warns off the course those
other pretenders to the divine art, which be has
pledged himself to follow as long as the saw has a
tooth left, or the old man breath to draw i;: —
“ Ah, thou sweet songster to the poet’s race,
Sing oft thy songs, but hide thy shameless face.”
As no photo accompanies these verses, we are left
in the dark as to “ Poeta’s ” own face; but this we
get over when we consider that no such breadth
of view can come from eyes less than twelve inches
apart. We could not, if we wished, get in his por-
trait without enlarging the paper. And, to reduce
it, would be to make little of struggling genius—a
thing we would never do. And now. spelling and
everything is scattered, as he would say, like a
strip of stringy bark when the flying-fox of
murky night Dangs up against the aboriferous
tree in his hurry to get something to eat:—
“ ’Twas truely said that Nature, when her gifts she j
spread , ,. .
Intended you should spend your time reclining on
some attic bed,
Out of the hearing of street Arabs at their noisy
But. dear friend, that attic should have been a
jail.”
Oh, yes. Our columns will reek with poetry as
long as “ Poetas ” are coming on. It is but due to
our young bard to say that, much as we value his
present effort, we value still more his forethought
in supplying, in the last word of the last stanza, an
address that will reach him, when Gordon knows
him no longer.
The editor of the Watchman takes a
gloomy if not doubtful view of the advantage to
be derived from the extension of the railway
from Nyngan to Hourke. Just hear the gifted
scribe As the train nears our town, the means
of access to the lufflan and scoundrel become
as easy as to the legitimate business man, and un-
fortunately are takea advantage of to almost as
great an extent. If we are correctly informed, as
the facilities for reaching Bourke have increased,
so have the undesirable section of the community,
and there are now more brothels—though they
pass under other names—in Bourke than there
are public - houses, while the couples living
in unwedded bliss are neither few nor
far between. It may very reasonably be
asked to what is this lowered tone of morality
attributable, and what is the remedy ?” Quite
reasonable, indeed, even though the coincidence is
double-barrelled. But as the erudite querist has
already laid the blame on the facilities afforded by
rapid transit, what need is there for us to go hunt-
ing round for other causes ? Btill, we may offer a
suggestion. The climate is, if we remember right
pretty sultry at Bourke, and, if we are to give an y
credence to Lord Byron’s sentiments, that may
account for the number of “ couples who live in
bliss,” as well as for the bagnios which
are so plentiful in that modern City of the Plains.
And, now, about the remedy. Our first idea was to
petition the Government against extending the
railway any further In that direction ; but, on
more mature consideration, we reckon that no-
thing: short of a healthy shower of fire and brim-
stone would work any appreciable purification in
the moral atmosphere of Bourke. Peter Campbell
wr»stled with Satan there for a snell, and his
brother in the Loard, the pious Westwood, had a
tussle with the Bvil One in that locality. When
they failed to find even five good men in the
town, we fear that even the stoppage of river
as well as mail communication with the outside
world would not succeed iu improving the morals
of Bourke. And that reminds us A couple of
weeks ago the police pounced upon a shanty-
keeper in the neighbourhood of Bourke, and
hauled him up before the local police court for
sly grog-selling. The case seemed so dead against
the sly-grog man that a number of his sympa-
thisers, reckoning on a foregone conclusion,
clubbed together, and with commendable zea 1 ,
soon raised £30, the full amount of the anticipated
tine, and handed the money over to the defendant.
Owing to some legal technicality, the prosecution
broke down, when the shanty man and his
“missus” stepped Into their buggy, and without
as much as saying i“ By yer leave,” drove off at a
brisk pace, forgetting in their haste to get home
to return the £30 to their friends. At this juncture
one of the donors waxed wrath and begged the
loan of a horse from one of the bystanders to start
in pursuit of the shanty man and recover the
money. But, unfortunately, his good intentions
were nipped In the bud, as the proud possessor of
the animal fiimly, though, it must be said, reluc-
tantly, refused to le-nd his Arab st ;ed, lest per-
adveuture, neither horse nor rider should return
again. And, now that we come to think the matter
over, It appeals t > us that after all the ink spilled
in lamentations by the Bourks mo.alist, the repre-
sentative citizen of that town can look with a
certain amount of content on the influx of
strangers, and exclaim in the language of the
poet: “ You're all right for a sharp trick or two;
but when it comes to villainy, allow me.”

Nothing could have been happier or better ar-
ranged. On arrival, that pleasure of all pleasures
dancing, was commenced to the dulcet strains of
Ingram’s orchestra. A ffoor smooth as ice, ladies
n-ice, who do their best to ent-iee and make happy
the miserable life of bachelors, were some of toe
attractions of the afternoon. A skating match
for non-skaters made fun for the lookeis on. A
merry peal from tho bell announcing the ban-
quet,'served in grand stylo by host Smith, was
answered by a merry peal of laughter from
the belles, who, with their attendant cavaliers,
numbared some forty couples. Mr. D. R. Mit-
oholl occupied the chair, and made a telling little
Speech concerning the guest ot the day’, fde
ball - room being lighted, once more dancing
commenced. Mrs. M’Laughliu wore a handsome
toilette of black velvet and heliotrope satin,
fashiouably mad©, bonnet to match, and seemed
as happy as a good fairy. Her niece, a vivacious

with black velvet, and a young lady in mourning,
were as lovely as a summer’s night. black satin
bodice, cream llama skirt, was becoming to Miss

The Drapers made a big splash on Thurs-
day la it. when they managed to draw 1000 people
to Clontarf (we love Clontarf) for their annual
picnic. A gloom was cast over the city; the
mashers were down nearted ; there was not a
pretty little milliner to be seen, but at Clontraf
they were as thick as bees or butterflies, and twice
as beautiful to behold. White dresses are noted
for picnics, and on this occasion many were to be
seen, although there were numerous toilettes of
different colours, making u rainbow-like scene.
But this was not all the joy; M.P.’s, and the Hons.
G. R. Dibbs and W. J. Trickett, who navigated the
waters of our beautiful harbour in a private steam
launch, put in an appearance, arriving on the
Golden Shore (to us) just in time lor dinner.
Ladies and gentlemen to the number of about 240
satdown to dinner. Mr. Shaw, of Peapes and Shaw,
occupied the chair, Messrs Dibbs and Trickett
on his right; while Mr. of D, Jones and Co.,
and others, were on his left. There were any
amount of toasts-in fact, we do not expect to be
more toasted down below; and wo heard lots
about “our magnificent Post-office, with its new
street,” tho Property-tax, the Land question, and
the draporv business, from the Hon. G. R. Dibbs.
Mr. Dan O’Connor was happy in “ The day we cele-
brate.” The giddy gay gathering of youth and
beauty indulged ull day in dancing to the lively
music of the United Fire Brigades Band of twenty
performers. There were otnors who passed the
pleasant hours in gathering beautiful ferns, and
others again who ’wont in for the aquatic and
athletic sports. Catering Co. purveyed in the old
Pavilion. All came homo in the gloaming, the
steamers arriving safely, although they (steamers)
were “screw’d.”

17th.) There is, probably, no national saint or
sinner whose anniversary is so loyally kept as
Patrick's, of Ireland. Next Monday, in every
important city in tho world, as well as in tho log*
settlements of tho United States and Canada, and
the stringy bark towns of Central Australia, will
be seen the sturdy men from the Shannon, the
Barrow, or the Blackwater, keeping holiday for a
man whose bones were dust centuries before the
Frank crossed tho Rhine, or the Normans turned
their attention to England. The affair at Smith's
Garden’s is to consist of “divarshun” of various
kinds, and, in the evening, there is to bo a concert
of Irish tho Gaiety. We have seen the
programme, and tho names of the performers
should certainly ensure success. We see, also,
that many of tbc items are selected from that
sweetest of lyrists, Tom Moore, whoso melodies,
nearly two generations ago, wore to be found in
every English drawing-room.

Tennyson was the scene of much gaiety on
Saturday, the «th inst., tho occasion being the
annual picnic of the Balmain Amateur Dramatic
Club. A large number of members and their
friends availed themselves of the opportunity to
spend a pleasant afternoon up stream; and under
the popular stewardship of Messrs. Alfred Perry
and J,J. Smith, who proved themselves as suc-
cessful in this capacity as in their efforts on the
histrionic boards, everything passed off very satis-
factorily. Dancing was pretty generally resorted
to by the picnicdlsts, although a few happy pairs
appeared to prefer tho sweet seclusions of Tenny-
son’s sylvan shades to the music of Hobson’s band.
A programme of twelve dances was cheerfully
carried out, notwithstanding the earnest atten-
tions of old Sol, after which the anchor was—figu-
ratively speaking —weighed, and the pleasure-seek-
ers teamed back to town apparently well pleased
with their excursion. Many pleasantly familiar
faces wore to be seen on deck, and to say
that the fair daughters of Balmain were numer-
ously represented it to say that youth and beauty
were there also in all their fascinating variety.
Among the ladies were disiinguished the Misses
Moran, looking sweet in white and lawn colour. Miss
Wisehart appeared in a tasteful costume ot dove
coloured cashmere. Mias Jones wore a zephyr
sateen. Miss Booth and Miss Wallace looked
charming in white, and cream, and cardinal,
respectively. A handsome dress was of grey
trimmed with hiack velvet, but rather sombre for
tho occasion ; it was, however, well supported by
several black costumes, whose wearers appeared
In some instances to be somewhat affected by
their serious attire. Tho journey home was
enlivened by the usual impromptu concert, which
seems to spring into existence as an indispensable
adjunct of a homeward trip. Unhampered by
sackbuts or cymbals, the vocal resonance of the
exuberant chorus rang out on the evening air,
only ceasing at times to admit the solo of some
pleasant-voiced member, whose lung power
enabled him to rise to the emergency. We heard
again that time honoured “Now! my courage,”
given with as much •• verve ” as on Friday week ;
and we prophesied laurels In store for the young
club in which so much talent and good humour
appealed to exist.

News reaches us from home of a Sal *ation
Army wedding, which was recently celebrated
with all tho conspicuous formulae adopted by that
very conspicuous organisation. The chilling cere-
mony before the registrar having previously been
endured, the parties then proceeded to get mar-
ried in their own way to the accompan'ment of
drums and cymbals, trumpets and “ volley firing.”
We wonder if a time will come when benedict will
trifle with the baby, put cotton wool in his ears,
and yearn for tho last peaceful moments of his
singleness and the lullaby of that brass band.

A series of Cinderella dances were inaugu-
rated by royalty in January last, for the purpose
of replenishing the funds of the Chelsea Hospital
tor Women, and brought together a large and
fashionable concourse. Some of the dresses at-
tracted great attention, as much for the exquisite
taste as for the originality displayed in their con-
ception. The adaptation to other purposes of that
white elephant, a wedding veil, was skilfully
managed by draping it very gracefully over a full
skirt of white tulle, on which the pattern of
the Honiton lace showed very effectively. The
bodice worn with the skirt was made of white
stamped velvet. Another pretty dress of white
tulle was wreathed round the bodice with a thick
garland of drooping snow-drops. A second gar-
land of similar blossoms trimmed the skirt, and
small bunches of the flowers nestled here and
there among the folds of the tulle. A very pretty
gown was made ef pink tulle, with chenille spots
and masses of scarlet poppies round the bodice
and down one side of the skirt. A black dress had
sweet little clusters of “crushed strawberry”
marabout feathers on the shoulders and dotted
about the skirt. Another dress was ot cream
coloured satin, with bodice and drapery of terra-
cotta satin. For “ uniqueness,” commend us to a
pink silk, scattered over with flowers, in the pom-
padour style, and much trimmed with lace. From
the shoulder, where'it was fastened with a mother-
of-pearl crescent, depended a scarf of silk, which
fell be'ow the waist and mingled with the drapery
of the skirt.

A fashionable party, a warm evening, and
the waltz just ended. From a twilight corner of
the verandah came, in low accents, “ Feel my
heart, how it’s beating.” It wasn’t quite a con-
ventional request from a young lady. But a
moment later a calm voice said, “I didn’t think
there was so much art there.”

Dearest Heele, —We are just home from Mrs.
Grey’s Kettledrum, and, before I forget, I must
tell you something about it. Our hostess looked
sweetly pretty in u cream cashmere tea gown,
trimmed elaborately with the very narrowest
ruby ribbon velvet; and a cap of cream lace and
ruby pompons. That dear old Mrs. Smithkins was
there, who, as you remember, possesses c. great
deal more wealth than learning. She put her foot
in it sadly to-day, and I felt really sorry for her,
for, after all, she is a good-natured old soul. We
were looking at a splendid edition of “Paradise
Lost,” and upon some one making a remark about
the anthor, Mrs. Smithkins, who will have her say
in everything, said to our hostess “ Let me see, my
dear, Mr. Milton lives at Ashfleld, doesn’t he ?”
Poor Mrs. Grey gulped down a smile, and turning
very red >• 1th the effect, gave out a faint “ n-no.”
“ Well, ray dear, I thought it very likely he did,
seeing that, there's a street called Milton-street. I
wouldn’t be so sure that there isn't a Milton-house
there too. ’ By tuis time, you may be sure, we
were all feeling very hot, but a diversion was for-
tunately caused by a young lady spilling her tea
all over her nice dress, which I more that suspect
she did on purpose. Anyhow, it was very timely,
and wo were all truly thankful for the accident.
One of the pleasantest occupations on a hot day
is to sit in Baumanns’, eat fruit ices, and look at
the beautiful costumes which can always be seen
there, a doctor’s young bride was there one day
last week dressed in claret satin trimmed with
broad cr°am Spanish lace—small princesse bonnet
with claret trimming. A terra-cotta ottoman silk
made with short basque, and numerous loops of
narrow ribbon adorning sleeves and shoulders,
was extremely stylish. The hat worn with this
was not in strict good taste, as it was literally
weighed down on one side with artificial fruit. I
am sure there was sufficient for a good dessert
for several people. Hats worn without trimming,
save the lining, and a large bow in front, look, to
my mind, affected. There is an unfinished look
about them, which Edith says is stylish, but it is a
style for which I care not. Curry powder colour
is very becoming to some complexions. I saw a
young lady with pink cheeks wearing a nun’s
cloth dress of that hue, which suited her admir-
ably. The straw of her hat was an exact match;
in fact the whole costume, gloves, ribbons, &c.,
were in splendid keeping with the dress material.
A peacock and ruby brocade redingote over a
plain satin ruby skirt looked brilliant on the Block
on Saturday morning. I saw very few cotton
dresses, but a dark blue, with large white spots,
made with baby body, and with which was worn a
silver zone, was amongst the nicest. I think we
have seen about the last of the whites, too, for
this season. What a run they have had, to be sure.
I acknowledge the justice of your reproach,
dear, for my having neglected to tell you all about
“ Fedora,” but, really, if I described her dresses to
you as minutely as they deserved, it would more
than fill my letter. However, as I know you are
curious to know something about them, I will try
and give you some idea. In the first scene she
wears a salmon pink satin with brocaded train,
short basque of rich crimson velvet, with slashes
of the same down the skirt; silver pins in her
black hair. The next is the most beautiful of all.
The richest ot ivory satins, flounced with broad
soft white lace, with sprays of creamy white half-

This bodice, with fichu trimming, is made of pale-blue corded silk, the trimming
beiug tulle of corresponding colour, darned with silk. Cross stripes of white silk tulle
are arranged on each side of the heart-shaped opening at the neck, while a small but
full frill makes a pretty finish behind. Young ladies who are fond of fancy-work, can
easily darn their own lace, as patterns for designs can be procured at almost any
fancy shop.

When a lady sprinkles her dressing-room
with Murray and Lanman’s Florida Water, it
becomes to one sense at least a delicious llorai
bower. No tropical grove can exhale a rarer
fragrance.
Arsenic and quinine are not desirable
commodities to carry about in one’s system, and it
is to be hoped that the poisonous ague remedies

opened rose-buds st udded all over the skirt, and also
one in her hair. With this costume she carries a fan
composed entirely of white ostrich feathers. Fancy
fanning oneself with a dozen beautiful feathers!
Next is a pale blue dress of silk and satin with
silver fringe and some soft fluffy material for
trimming. With this she wore u ost uncommon
ornaments, in the shape of two large birds with
deep green plumage which were embedded on
each side of the skirt. In the kettledrum scene
her tea-gown was very pretty. The fourth width
was composed entirely of cream lace flounces,
from which was taken a long train of pompadour
satin of a large pattern, the ground being cream,
and the flowers a mixture of pale brown and blue,
ghb dispensed tea very gracefully, but, had I been
her guest, I should have liked it better if she had
put in the milk and sugar first, instead of after the
tea was poured into the cup. You see even Fedora
doesn’t know everything, or she would know therb
is a right and wrong way in pouring out a cup of
tea. Miss Novaro didn’t look amiss in an old gold
satin dress trimmed with a crimson and old gold
brocade. Her second dress, though, suited her best
—a pale blue silk with deep crimson velvet bows,
white plush hat adorned with pale blue plumes.
Miss Mainwaring’s green satin must hav® had
dozens of yards of white lace on it. I don’t think
I ever saw a dress with such a profusion. Her
bodice was braided with gold braid, and edged
with gold fringe. And that is all about “Fedora”
this time. The dresses in the circle were rather
sombre, a light, flowered satin, with kiltings of
claret satin, being about the prettiest. I saw a
lady who had such a profusion of hair that she had
it done in two different Myles. She had a large coil
low on the neck, whilst on the top of her bead,
arranged slightly to the left side, was another of
equal size. It looked strange—very strange.
It may be interesting to you to know that riding
habits are no longer confined to dark colours, for
dull reds, sky blues, and golden browns are all
worn, and the skirts are shorter than ever. Ever

VANITY FAIR.
A scientist says the reason kissing is so
pleasant is because the teeth, jaw-bones, and lips
are full of nerves, and when the lips meet, an
electric current is generated. We were aware
that it took considerable nerve to kiss a pretty
girl the first time, but now we understand why so
many succeed in doing it—At the beginning of
every year, the Princess of Wales instructs her
various houses of business to fit up small shops in
her saloon set apart for the purpose in Marlboro’
House. She then goes round and purchases what
she requires for herself, or for presents at home
or abroad. Though, why any woman should be
satisfied with that when she could turn a whole
warehouse upside down, we can’t understand—
“ Before I would kneel to any woman, I would
hang myself,” said an old bachelor; “am I not
right?” he said, turning to a girl. “Certainly,”
she replied; “for the woman’s sake.” — A lady
testified the other day that her husband wanted
her to commit suicide, so as to allow him to marry
an actress. Although she had repeatedly valued
her husbands happiness better than her own life,
she wouldn’t die to oblige him. This shows how
contrary woman is A beautifully Illustrated
book has just been issued, setting forth the ele-
gance of Adelina Patti’s £10,000 palace car. The
illustrations are exquisite, but the one which will
be apt to capture the public is that representing
the charming cantatrice asleep in her bed, with
Nieolini climbing gracefully into the top bunk —
Several brides have lately walked to the altar
gloveless. Another sensible idea is to be attended
by one maid of honour or two, but no more; the
bridegroom having no groomsm«n at all—Head-
ing Amy a little lecture on neatness, Mamma said,
“A great deal is indicated by the arrangement of
a young lady’s hair.” And her brother, who had
seen her come in after saying good-bye to Henry
at the gate, broke in, quite needlessly, “ Ha !
there’s a good deal indicated by the dis-
arrangement of a girl’s hair; ain’t there, sis?”
London women wear red ulsters. They also adorn
their hats with cat’s heads; no doubt to indicate
the scratching propensities of the sex There
are other emporiums in Paris as much sought as
Worth’s, each dress creator having some distinc-
tive style, but no other is so fertile in original and
successful ideas A fashion writer says: “The
grotesque and sad-coloured dresses misnamed
iesthetic, have nearly disappeared. I only saw
one or two; for instance, a bright, mustard yellow,
with lines of cardinal feather trimming, and rib-
bons hanging about aimlessly. Another was a
dismal green, with large red bows, yellow scarf
and red bodice. The fresh, girlish faces of some of
these devotees atone for much that is fearful and
wonderful in their toilettes—but when it comes to
seeing a very antiquated ‘unappropriated bless-
ing’ in glaring terra-cotta, with towzled hair, 1
really think it is time to call in the police!”....Mary
Anderson is prettier off the stage than on. She
was conspicuous lately at a private view in the
Royal Academy, as one of the neatest figures
ameng the aristocratic crowd. She wore a plain,
close-fitting long black jacket, with fur cuffs and
collar; and those who saw her mother with her
considered she must have been once quite as lovely
as her daughter. The lovely actress has no father,
hut came over to England with her step-father,
Griffin, who, on arrival, cabled home to America
this neat message: “ Me and Mary’s arrived safe.’’...
Oranlline is a new substance for doing fancy paint-

grunted a well-known rowing man on the Rand-
wick-road last week, as a bicycle lamp stole
silently on them before he could slip his arm from
a soft, round bodice. “I’ve lent her to you, sir,
for to-night,” replied the wheelman politely, and
disappeared in the darkness. That rowing man
has been wondering ever since how much truth
there wasin the remark—It’s thought very likely
that short waists will come in. They have been
gradually shortening—apparently, we mean—for
some time, and the stylo is well suited to the scarf
sashes now coming into vogue at home. Besides,
the short hair almost cries out for the quaint little
waists under the arms. Madame Hecamier, whose
face bewitched half France, was celebrated for
her short hair. And in the great picture of her in
the Louvre she combines the coiffure and ceinture
both at their shortest—Plnsuti’s last fashionable
song is “ Laddie.” It was so sweet that Theo.

At a recent Westminster wedding, each of the six
bridesmaids wore a Henri II. hat of crimson velvet

Flaneur says:—“Marie Burroughs is the
most beautiful woman on the New York stage to-
day, and took the house by storm in her first act.
Very little is known of her, except that she came
from ’Frisco, where she was an amateur. She is
tall, with a perfect figure and magnificent eyes,
and is as graceful as Adelaide Neilson. In a few
years, she will be a famous woman.” The reason
Tennyson chose, on his move to the peerage, the
cumbrous title “Baron Tennyson D’Eyncourtof
Aldworth,” is because he is, through his great-
grandmother, the hereditary representative of the
Barony of D’Eyncourt, which was forfeited by
attainder in the x*eign of Henry Vll, Aldworth is
the name of his present residence The Ameri-
cans are highly satisfied with themselves. An
Argonaut writer, after enlarging on Miss Cham-
berlayne, Miss Anderson, Lillian Russell, and other
native productions, says:—“The majority of
English beauties are called good-looking because
they unite a fair amount of good looks with good
blood. So many titled women in England are ab-
solutely plain that when one comes along who is
not absolutely plain she is at once dubbed a beauty.
Gladys, Lady Lousda’e, or Lady Custlereagh
would never be called beautiful in America.”
He was a Dutchman, and got into a row. They

about “ A painted dress upon a painted woman.”
— Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, had magnifi-
cent hair ; and one day, to annoy the Duke, she
cut off her splendid tresses and flung them in his
face. We believe she was in earnest Literary
bracelets ar« the latest fad of transatlantic belles.
The bangle consists ot some dozen tiny gold books
linked together, each bearing the name of some
favourite author Corean ladies are before their
white sisters in matters ot attire. The convenient
divided skirt is an old fashion with them —
At a recent exhibition in London, iron jewellery
was shown. There were ear-rings, comb", neck-
laces, and bracelets of the greatest artistic beauty,
drawn out almost as line as gold, and lighter.
They were made in the last century — “Madge”
pithily observes; “Why is there such a stigma
upon old maids? I am sure many a girl would
remain unmarried only for that. As it is, they
look upon marriage as a sort of redemption from
obloquy.” Well, we don’t think there ought to be
any obloquy because a woman is an old maid.
Usually, it’s not her fault Ladies are now wear-
ing waistcoats exactly like gentlemen’s. So, when
a marri-d man goes to bed now, he has to put a
chalk-mark on his waistcoat, or else he’ll pro .ably
discover when he reaches office next morning, by
the fact of the pockets containing a miscellaneous
lot of buttons, a broken garter buckle, and a hair-
pin, that he’s wearing his wife’s raiment. He
most likely calls to mind at the same moment that
in his own pocket he left a couple of sovereigns
and some loose silver “What do you think of
Mrs. Blank?” asked one lady of another at the
theatre. “ She is beautiful.” was the reply; “but
she is a very cold woman.” Tomkyns, who was
standing by, observed that Mrs. Blank was in full
opera costume, and didn’t wonder at her being cold.
..Habits of life amongst the Dutch in Banjaiwangie
(abridged from Father Woods’ account): Itise at
5, cup of coffee or tea, a walk, gentlemen in airy,
ladles in almost etherial costume; at 7 a cold
snack; business done early; at noon the rice
table, or formal breakfast, curry soup, fish, pre-
serves, jams, mincemeat, sambois, salads, joints
(Australian meat), cheese and coffee; siesta in un-
dress; at i, tea in the verandah; lounge en des-
habille till sunset; evening bath, walk; dinner at
8.30; bed. Bangez-mangez would be the right
name for the place, since life there seems to be
“du lit d la table, de la tableau lit.” There are
twenty-five Knights of the Garter (exclusive of
Princes, foreign potentates, etc.), and it is the
most ancient and honorable of English Orders.
The dignity was created by Edward 111. soon after
Cressy, for distinguished soldiers. It is borne
now by some men who are neither soldiers nor
distinguished. When a Knight is created, he has
to get a surcoat, mantle and hood, a George collar,
cap and feathers all of the specified pattern, and,
of course, the Garter itself. This is of blue velvet
bordered with gold, bearing round it the most
famous motto known tojthe world— Honi wit i/ui
■mil y pense; and it is worn under the left knee.
There is also a star for the breast, hung to a
ribbon of the colour known as garter blue. The
only woman Knight of the Garter is the Queen, by
virtue of being the reigning sovereign. No other
woman can be made a Knight, though, of course,
she may wear the what-d’you-call-it as much as
she likes. Beaconsfleld’s “stall” (every Knight
of the Order has a stall in St. George’s chapel,
Windsor) has been kept vacant by the Queen for
three years, a piece of favouritism unprecedented.
Wales’ ” Lady Chamberlain has been left four
million dollars by an uncle The morals ®f
Madrid—like those of Mayfair—are peculiar. Not
long ago, a Spanish attache married a very lovely
girl. Three days afterwards ho was ordered to
Cuba via Cadez. But he missed his train, some-
how. and when he returned found the Duke of L.
bossing the place generally, he having, imme-
di itely prior to the husband’s arrival, sent the
hired girl out for a pint. The expressed a
wish to see the missus, and the Duke “tried
strongly to persuade him not to do so.” But be
insisted. The next day he was discovered stabbed
to the heart. Verdict—suicide. The tone of the
Spanish papers respecting this little domestic inci-
dent tended to jocularly blame the husband fox-
being “indiscreet.” ...An Indian Prince has just
had a crystal throne made in Birmingham. The
chair of it is nine feet from the gi-ound, with pillars
holding a canopy above. The structure appears
to be entirely of pure white glass, the small
quantity of wood and iron used in it being encast d
in mirrored glass, so as to be invisible. Every
uart is “ cut plate glass, and so fitted up as to
make the throne seem carved fi-om one solid
block. The cushions are crimson velvet. The last
wonderful thing an Indian Prince got was, we
recollect, a bedstead (costing about the price
of Buckingham Pa’ace) with life-sized angels to
fan and sing him to sleep. Next thing, we are
expecting to hear that an Indian Prince has
ordered some English firm to make him a private
heaven. Then he can set up the crystal throne,
angels, and have the whole caboodle
complete.
Atl eccentric London apple-woman, re-
cently defunct, left special Instructions in her
will for the sum of £10 to be spent in refresh-
ments by the mourners at her funeral. It must
have been a real pleasure to follow a woman like
that to the grave.
How lew realise the dreary truth of the
statement of J. Hatton, the author of ‘ Jour-
nalistic Lonlon,” “that journalism is the grave of
genius. Statesmen, philosophers, novelists, poets
(says he) have gone down to the grave poor
and unrewarded, broken on the wheel of the
dally press.” By the way, what a big grave of
genius they must have round at the Alfred
and Shroud factories. A regular trench for
trenchant writers.
From the Melbourne Herald we learn
1 that Major Atkinson, the Premier of New Zealand,
Is exceedingly anxious for “ particulars regarding
the causes and most likely means of remedying
j the social evil.” So; what did the artful Major do.
! when In Melbourne, but call upon Mr. Hill, the
I City Missionary, “as one who had the advantage
of considerable city experience.” The result was
that Mr. Hill favoured the Major with “ a very
interesting letter on the subject.” The notion of
calling on a missionary upon such a delicate
matter would seem very funny if we didn’t happen
to remember the case of a Mr. Aineus English
(engaged in Melbourne mission work), who com-
mitted suicide under circumstances showing that
he had gained a deep insight into this same “ social
evil.”
Mark Twain, rolling out the praises of
Adam and his claims to a memorial statue, says:
“But, on the other hand, look at Adam! What
have wc done for Adam ? Nothing. What has
Adam done for us ? Everything. He gave us life,
he gave us death, he gave us heaven, he gave us
| hell. These are inestimable privileges; and, re-
member, not one of these should wo have had
without Adam. Well, then, he ought to have a
monument, for evolution is steadily and surely
abolishing him.”—
Let sculptors weild the artist knife
For Adam, who gave precious life;
Let honours high to him be given
Who gifted us with pearly heaven;
But, let your tip-top praises swell
For him who sent us—death and hell !

The London Jeweller.
London, September 1,1883.
“ The progress and success which it is possible
for a commercial enterprise to reach, is shown
very forcibly by a descriptive account which the
American Waltham Watch Company are now
issuing to the English watch trade, and we under-
stand that any jewellers desirous of distributing
these leaflets in their neighbourhood with the
view of promoting business* aim have a supply on
application to the ofllces of the Company at
Holborn-circus. The buildings at Waltham, it is
stated, cover an area of 48,374 feet, the frontage
on the street is 734 feet, length of main building
646 feet, aggregate length of benches 3 - 87 miles,
length of shafting 3‘93 miles. These figures speak
eloquently of the present position of the enter-
prise, but the success and increasing sale of
the Waltham watch is very substantially proved
by the statement that it took 33 years to make
the first million watches, six years to make the
second million, and it is estimated that the third
mil'ion will be produced in about two years. It
would seem from this that every buyer of a
Waltham watch speaks well of it, and induces his
friends also to purchase, and they again do the
same, until the rate of increase becomes so for-
midable that it is difficult to comprehend what
will be the result a few years hence. But progress
like that shown in the leaflet referred to
proves not only the quality of the watch sold, but
also how well the Waltham Company must b©
managed: for the best article will not force its
way in the world unless it is assisted bv good
business capacity and generalship.
In the House, last week, Mr. F. B. Suttor recommended that one of the Parramatta
orphanages should be converted into a boys’ reformatory. He says: “ There is a large
quantity of land and a splendid building, and the only addition that would be required
would be a fence.” It would have to be aprecious high fence that would keep a larrikin in
that reformatory. At Boorioboola Gha, a much simpler plan of dealing with refrac-
tory kids prevails—as above.

ful and beneficial in nervous dyspepsia, nervous
depression following overwork and anxiety, as well
as the gastric derangements. Where there is
venous stagnation and sluggish circulation, a dull,

organs, and always with satisfactory results. It is
a good nerve tonic, and in some cases of morbid

WISDOMVILLE.
Wisdornville is a noble town, which pos-
sesses distinct advantages over many equally im-
portant places we have adorned with our presence;
ft possesses a “ liepresentative Organ and a
barber. Some persons are deluded into the idea
that It possesses two barbers, but experience tolls
us that this is not the case. On our arrival in
Wisdornville from Drousietown—the latter city
being hopelessly barberless-we pulled up In a
manner we much admired, at the more imposing-
looking barber’s shop of the two, entered, and
having summoned an elderly lady from a little
parlour with a glass door, through which we had
seen her dining, with much apparent gusto, out ot
a pudding basin, we requested her to produce the
barber. “ Oh,” said she, with a little cough, you
want a shave, sir?” “If you please.” ‘ Is there
anything you require?” she said timidly. Only
a short rasping with the most popular brush, wo
replied. “ Hem— er— the tact is— ” “Oh, we see, t
we said, quickly: “the barber’s dead.” 1 * No.
“Gone to take ills music lesson?” 'Sir, ho —
“ Engaged at his ‘ Poonah-painting ’ class ? No,
sir The fact is ” “Oh, we understand. How
long will it take him to get round ?” “Not that,
sir, at all.” (Very slowly.) " The fact is. wo are-
hem!—out of a barber at present. But you will
observe our stock et fancy goods ” ‘ Useless,
ma’am,” we cried, moving away; “wo have no use
for baby-linen, toffee-balls, cap-ribbons, or black-
ing. But stay I—” Hero we noticed her lace light
up a little. “ Is there another barber in this vast
metropolis?” "I cannot inform you, sir,” she
replied, coldly, picking a fly off the hardbake
“ And how long have you lived hero, madam ? we
enquired. “ Twenty-five years I ” Thunder I
Adieu 1 There is “another ” barber, who has little
about him to entitle him either to special mention
or to the insertion of his portrait. He is a con-
soienth us shaver, though; but puts his nose a
little too near your eye tor our money.
♦ ♦ ♦
Wisdornville lacks both the picturesque-
ness and the repose of Drousietown; but, as a set-
off against this, it has larger blow-flies, and its
beer, if possible, is more opaque. And there is
nothing scattered about Wisdomvllle. It consists
substantially of one street, which is bordered on
the right by a river. V ou have, therefore, to keep
a pretty straight course. For, if you go too far to
the left, you go into a public-house; and, it too
far to the right, you go into the water. The river
la pretty where it winds; but it is an implacable
river, and only winds once. The country round
about is low and-like the beer-flat. For you see
nothing but lucerne-paddocks and vineyards.
Everybody has either a vineyard or a lucerne-
paddock in Wisdornville, and a curious thing in
connection with the vignerons is they never drink
their own wine. Wo have tasted (in the stern
course of duty) all the wines made both at Drousie-
town and Wisdomvllle, and we have even seen
them make it. It seems simple, but they tell you
there is a secret in it. Before you have partaken
of the vintages of Wisdornville, you want to know
the secret; afterwards, you don’t. An exceedingly
oolite old gentleman asked us if we would go and
took at his still. He considered it curious. It is
curious. There is no secret about making white
spirit. You collect together all the grape skins,
stalks, cask refuse, bad, sour wine, and adding, as
the cookery-books have it, a sufficient quan-
tity of water, you put it iu the copper to stew.
Then, in a little while, a liquid of the precise
colour of water comes out of a spout. That s all.
What you have to be careful of, then, is not 10
taste it if you are asked. About a thimbleful was
put in a tumbler with a little water, and handed to
us We nodded pleasantly at the nice old gentle-
man and drank. Then the aspect of the world
changed. Ten million torches flashed before our
eves, we heard 40,000 dogs bark, and then went out
to trv and dig our grave with our thumb-nails. It
was 84- over-proof I The still proprietor states
that with this, and other preparations knovvn only
to himself, he could turn bad wine into good wine.
We implored him to keep the secret in his breast !
We said we had tasted the good wine and yearned
for the bad.
♦ * *
Near the still old gentleman is another
vigneron, who does a large business and takes the
Liberal. We went to see him, too. He told us
that the illimitable infinite was i-> juxtaposition to
the tenets of barbarism, and said that the last
reporter who visited him drank four bottles of
wine and borrowed a pair of socks. He intimated
that we could have a pair if we wanted em-those
the reporter had left behind. We thanked him,
and replied that when we required a couple of
telescopes, wo would let him know. To return to
Wisdornville, some idea of its length will be gained
by the information that it takes just threeminutes
to ride through it. Fred Archer could doubtless
do it in less than that time. It begins with a humpy
and a railway-station, and ends with a newspaper
office, the chemist’s shop, and the fashionable em-
porium where the aristocracy purchase their 10-
button gloves and pickled herrings.
♦ * *
The office of the Wisdomville Worrier
is a gorgeous, solemn, and majestic ruin. It was
erected, we believe, by Captain Bllgh; then it was
a fort. Subsequently it was a barracks, then a
church, and after that became a newspaper office.
The aboriginals, however, owing for their ads. and
paving their subscriptions chiefly in snakes, the
venture did not succeed. So the concern was sold
off. and the type was purchased, we believe, by
the proprietors of the Mudgek Independent.
Then the structure became a fort again, then a
bakery, then a ruin; and it is now once more a
newspaperoiflee. The Worrier is conducted by
the editor and a staff of two: though, when the
motive power of the Eagle press is neither at
school her engaged in a top tournament, we may
add—“and a little one in.” The paper is a bi-
weekly, but the editor called a meeting of the
citizens, and put it to them that if they considered
his making the Worrier a tri-weekly would send
the town along any faster, he’d do it. He left him-
self. he said with emotion, entirely in their hands.
After a brief consultation, the citizens thanked
the editor and stated that they didn t think it
would. So the Worrier is still a bi-weekly. It is
a very nice little paper indeed, and fas Ipts of
pressure on its epaco—when the editor is sitting on
a copy. m * *
Wisdornville is not strong iu churches,
“the duck who runs” the principal “gospel mill” *
having also to look after the souls of the people of
Drousietown. He therefore pays that place a
visit once a week, and has a rasp with the oevil to
an harmonium accompaniment. And that re-
minds us that for real, gay, attractive graveyards
Drousietown makes Wisdornville look small in-
deed. In the Drousietown cemeteries everything
is done to promote the comfort of the corpses that
can be imagined. W a don’t say that draughts and
chess are provided ; but nothing conducive to the
mental comfort o F the departed is wanting. There
is on the other hand, nothing in the Wisdornville
graveyards that would cause a person to wish to
lav his bones there. The Wisdomvillians, there-
fore. mostly die in Sydney. They don’t mind the
little extra expense, because Waverley is a
fashionable suburb, and the contingent advau-
tages of the cemetery are extraordinary.
» * •
From the cemeteries to the chemist’s shop
is a natural transition. Well, the biggest swell in
Wisdornville is the chemist; and the most attrac-
tive place there is his house and shop. It is the
loadstone ot the city. People can’t keep out of it.
W« say to ourselves every day We will not be
tempted,” yet ere the sun has trembled on the
meridian, behold us feebly purchasing scented
scap. in order to enjoy his conversation. This
gentleman is a virtuoso; and attends classical
concerts. A terrible rumour also pervades the
town that be can play on the French horn. If any
reader ot this journal is in want ot a stick of
perfumery cheap, we can supply him. We have
a cheap line in lavender water, and our
sample—at the price— of tooth-paste and hair-oil is
not to be surpassed. We can offer, too, anew thing
in perfume-fountains, unrivalled for the money;
and we will present a box of pills, gratis, to every
cash purchaser. The druggist has a lot of local
influence, being an alderman, and he said it we
should care about the post of chief inspector of the
municipal water-cart, he saw no reason why we
shouldn’t have it. It was a position of much trust
and responsibility, but If his influence with the
Mayor We made our acknowledgments, but
stated we should prefer the post of Personate of
a Reader at the School of Arts. He admitted
gloomily that they weren’t a reading people at
vVisdomville. And they are not. There Is a very
fair School of Arts there, and one day feeling, after
unripe peaches, a desire for solitude, we went into
the reading-room at about 11a.m. An hour passed
—no one came. At half-past 13 a man in his shirt-
sleeves put In his head and whistled. Having re-
freshed his mind with this literary entertainment,
he withdrew still whistling. At one o’clock, a
heated boy rushed in, and asked for Tom Criker—
just as he’d ask for beef. Then, having been told
the “right time,” he withdrew, shrilly singing.
The books are but little used, and some of the
papers quite untouched. But in the evening the
institute is well patronised, the intellectual game
of “ chequers ” being much in vogue amongst the
Wisdomvillians.
* * *
At rare intervals, a professional troupe
comes there and gives an entertainment. It docs
not matter what is the nature of the performance,
the inhabitants always call it “the play.” The
play came on two occasions while we illuminated
the town. One was “ Helen Vivian’s Merry
Makers,” and the other a phrenological and mes-
meric lecturer. The former, giving “a whirlpool
of foaming fun,” just mide enough to save their
having to walk upon the waves of the ocean to get
back to Woolloomooloo, while the scientific gentle-
man took the sum of one shilling sterling in the
first rush at the doors. There was no rush after
that; and the next day he departed in great
dudgeon, using picturesque language prior to em-
barking on the steamer. It is reported that once a
man came with an “ orrery”- an affair with the
stars and heavenly bodies painted upon a dark
curtain. There was only 8s. “in,” and when the
lecturer came forward and, tapping the curtain,
began “The planet Jupiter ” the audience
shrieked, “Haul up the curtain and let’s see the
Aggers“Hoist the bloomin’ rag and bring out
the snakes;” “Let’s «ee the Horreryfed,” and so
put a stop to a performance which would no doubt
have turned out to have been of an intellectual
nature. Had the lecturer have “ hoisted the rag,”
as requested, the audience would have been treated
to a view of another man cursing his luck, and
attending on three tallow candles with a pair of
snuffers. That is an Orrery.
Wisdomville possesses a handsome post-
office, and a postmaster whose civility is only
bounded by possibilities. There is a young lady
operator there of such fascinating appearaime that
nearly all the young fellows in the district go
broke on the electric fluid before the middle of the
week. We were in a similar predicament our-
selves once, and only recovered our normal con-
dition of alfluenco by writing an article for the
Worrier; the noble editor of which journal load-
ing, in return for our contribution, us with vege-
tables. There is a State school in Wisdomville,
and a Catholic one—to which all the little Romans
of Drousietown have to tramp daily. The State
schoolmaster is a nice old gentleman, whose prin-
cipal diversion, after hours, seems to be leading
about a horse. He bursts upon you in the dewy
morn, and in the darkening eve, always dragging
a horse about. You never see him on a horse by
any chance—always towing him. For a long time
this puzzled us, and at length we obtained a solu-
tion of the mystery. He is teaching the horse the
multiplication-table, and the animal, being aged,
and having had his education neglected, is too
bashful to speak louder than a whisper, until he
is perfect in his answers. It is said this gentleman
(the master) has considerable classical attainments.
Very likely. Few could touch him, anyhow, in the
art of leading a horse about with a clothes-line.
• • •
Owing to the constant arrival of the
steamers’ the Wisdomville hotels do a brisk busi-
ness. The most important is the Royal. That has
a bagatelle-table. There is no biliiard-table
in Wisdomviiie, but there are a Court-house, three
policemen, and a lock-up. The court-house is
dull, and as full of Echoes as the discriminating
reader. The atmosphere within is thick with the
odour of stale skulls. And you know that even
Yorick's, who was a man of infinite jest, and fre-
quently set the table in a roar—but, there! let us
say with Hamlet —“Pah!” May we, Mah? We
could tell you, we dare say, a lot more about
Wisdomville that would interest you. But please
excuse us. The thermometer is at 130., and—turn
your heads aside, ladies—it is our turn to stand in
the water-butt.
“ One hundred Suns and one Moon at the
Sun” is the style in which Mr. A. G. Vance an-
nounces his benefit, which has to take place in
December at the “Sun Palace of Varieties,”
Knlghl abridge, Eng. Glancing down the long
array of London music-hall talent congregated to
do honour to the occasion, we notice, amongst
many new and unfamiliar names, those of some
old veterans of the comic and serio-comic stage,
notably thole of Jolly John Nash Harry Rickards
and Arthur Llovd—and at this last we stop* for
memories Lise Memories, brought from their
sleep of years in the deep-down recesses of the
mind by the sight of the once so familiar name.
And so ho—Arthur, we mean—is in harness yet 1
H was in our round jacket era that we first saw
him, at a time when, disdaining the attractions of
first-class theatres, to most of which we bad-by
virtue of many acquaintances in Art-Bohemia—a
right of free entree, we would steal , off to our
beloved “ Pav.,” of which, at that per od, Arthur
Lloyd was the great attraction, notwithstanding
the fact that before access could be gained wo had
to part a “bob” out of our pocket-money. The
London Pavilion, Tichborne-street, Piccadilly, was
even then a most popular resort of what might be
called the lower middle-class Londoners. Clerks
from wholesale houses, with a sprinkling of small
tradesmen and master mechanics, with at times a
dozen or two of aristocrats out for a spree, or
weary of the Alhambra, just across the Square.
To our boyish fancy, the place, with its glare and
ghtter of plate-glass and gas, bright brasswork.
and crimson lounges, was the perfect acme of art
and comfort combined, and, with a doubtless de-
praved and vitiated taste, we preferred to hear
the roaring chorus sung by all hands en masse
rt 44 Fancy Free,” or ‘ The Red, White, and Blue,”
. .Up pnpfit passages in 44 King o Scots at the
1’ R Drury Lane, or the subtlest witticisms of
Sothem at the Haymarket. What a storm of ap-
plause used to greet the favourite as the blue-
cheeked gentleman—who always sat at a little
table surrounded by similar blue-cheeked gentle-
men all with moustaches apparently of the
consistency and shape of the circular patch at the
big end of a scrubbing-brush—tapped the table
smartly with his little hammer, whilst observing
that “ Mr Arthur Lloyd will now favour the com-
nnnv with a song,” and then Arthur, in that very
TObust tenor of his, would troll out some ditty of
the day. We lost our small heart there, too, we
remember, to a fair and most substantial charmer,
yclept 44 Madame Cerise,” who, night after night,
used to treat us to a ballad beginning By the
margin of Zurich’s fair waters.” We never could
make out any more of it after a month’s constant
attendance. She looked sublime, did Madame-at
a distance-and long we allowed our young love,
like a worm i’ the bud, to prey upon our vitals—
(by the way, this “Red Heart” isn’t as good
as the last)—till, one night, one awful night,
as we sat close up to the orchestra, a
wrinkled face, dripping with perspiration,
paint, and powder was poked round the
screen, and a strident voice shrieked out to a pass-
ing waitress: “Biddy, ye divil, bring us a pot o’
’arf an’ arf, quick, for it’s that ’ot I can’t abear
myself.” We gave one half-incredulous, despair-
ing look, gasped for breath, and fainted. The
Juno-like Cerise was, after that, like one of a cer-
tain poet’s “ Blue Mountain sonnets,” simply a
bitter memory, and we turned our seared affec-
tions towards a young—we made sure she was
young this time, for Arthur himself told us she
was only six and twenty—lady, who used to accom-
pany on the piano the evolutions, or rather, con-
volutions of the “Bounding Brothers of Bara-
taria,” but the deceitful villain didn’t tell us she
was the better-half of the oornet-a-plston, whereby
we-but never mind Since these far-off days,
when going to the “Pav.” often involved posses-
sion of the “key of the street,” forcing us to seek
the hospitable shelter of afore-mentioned Bohe-
mians—a hearty, jolly, ever-hoping, ever-getting
“skied” fraternity, who dwelt, as a rule, nearer
Heaven than the pavement, but of whom many
have since found fame and fortune, with the right
to add to their names the magical “R.A.,” and whose
efforts are now no more “skied,” but hang in
the place of honour on “opening day,” instead of,
as in the times of which we write, often helping—
towards the “ wee sma’ hours ”—to pillow weary
heads. Since those days, then, although we have
visited “ sing-songs ” of every conceivable grade,
and in almost every part of the world, from the
Alhambra at its best or Charley Wright’s Colos-
seum in Melbourne, from Tur Grilnen Gaus in
Vienna to the Bella Union in New Orleans, and
from The House of Dulcet Sounds in Sinaton to
the old Cafd de 1’Imperatrice in Paris, yet the
pleasantest memories of all that do yet abide with
us are connected with the old Pavilion days, or
jather nights; and now were we offered by some
benevolent fairy our choice, whether to retain the
vast fortune and grey hairs, accumulated through
the passed away years, or of carting with the
dimes and finding ourselves back again in round
jacket listening to Arthur and mashing the cornet-
a-piston’s near relative, we should, we say un-
hesitatingly—stick to the pile.

A Beautiful Painting.— Mr. G. Q. Green,
of Woodbury, New Jersey. U.S.A., is presenting
to druggists and others in this country some very
line pictures iu oil of his magnificent house and
grounds and laboratory at that place. Mr. Green
is the proprietor of Boschee’s German Syrup and
Green’s August Flower, two very valuable medi-
cines, which are meeting with great favour, the
first as a remedv for Pulmonary complaints, and
the latter for Dyspepsia and disorders of the Liver
These preparations have attained an immense sale
solely on their superior merits and are sold by all
druggists throughout the world. The price is the
same for each, 3s. 6d. per bottle, or sample bottles
for 6d. The sample bottles enable suaeivis .o

Art triumphs over Nature, sav j ■ write-
in London Truth; if the skeleton of lovely woman
at all corresponded to the contour of her dressed
form, the anatomists would have to go to school
again. The bust is so abnormally developed that
It takes nobody in. Gently curving outlines are
quite out of date. What is now aimed at is to
make the bust swell out abruptly, in the pigeon
shape, from the lowest point or the neck, and
most of the fashionable ladies now indulge in
figures whose most prominent peculiarity is their
suggestiveness of the dairy. The bust being high
and full, an equilibrium has to be arranged by an
immense bustle, and then both curves are united
by a long waist. Certainly, these ingenious con-
trivances are rather delicate matters to enlarge
upon; but it is evident that a woman does not put
on such admirably adjusted mechanisms, with all
the natty dexterity and calculating forethought
at her command, for any other purpose than to have
them noticed. A woman will go to any trouble
about her figure, or any suffering; but she doesn’t
do it for nothing. She wouldn’t do it on a desert
island. For Instance, there was at the Opera a start-
ling dress no woman would wear for her own indi-
vldual satisfaction, probably, in any house with-
out men in it. The body was high in front, but at
the back it was cut down so very low in the shape
of a V, that the point nearly touched the waist
belt. How the waist was laced into form it was
difficult to understand, as there was nothing what-
ever to be seen in the V opening but natural
charms. The fair wearer of this toilet has a spare
neck in front, which places her at a disadvantage
Inordinary evening dress, but the back of the neck
and dorsal region being fine, she adopted the un-
usual dtcoUetagc described. Now, when a French-
woman experimentally puts on a bustle, she opens
the doors of her armoire a glace, and successively
gets it at angles with another mirror, so that she
can survey her figure from different points of
View, and changes and arranges until the im-
prover is what she wants it to be. Then she finds
something more is required to represent her per-
son in due proportion. A larger curve is necessary
higher up. This curve is created. Then the head
must be brought into harmony, so the tresses are
brushed up in a complicated edifice. If is in this
way that fashions spring up In Paris. When they
are launched by very beautiful or v&ry piquant
and prominent wooden, they are eagerly adopted
fiy otne - Parisiennes, but not slavishly imitated,
taeir original forms they are exported, and go
-ound the world. There are lew Parisian belles
war, mnpletely adopt a mode. They assimilate it,
and twist it into harmony with their own style.
But many other women, directly a thing becomes
fashionable, purchase it and put it on, regardless
of how it suits. This is the thing to be guarded
against. Never forget harmony, ladies.
A country correspondent sends along a
true tale of selfishness and bigotry, which is in-
deed a sad commentary on our boasted civilisation
of the 19th century. It appears that a certain
farmer i ell sick, and called in a physician of a cer-
tain school. Finding he was getting no better
very fast under this medico, he sent for the apostle
of the opposite sect, who cheerfully refused to
come, as his hated rival had been first employed,
and his treatment, of course, rendered the chances
of a cure impossible. Then the other fellow
bucked because his skill had been doubted, and,
strange to say, the farmer died without being
assisted out of the world by either of the sons of
Aesculapius. Right here the “ clargy ” took a
hand ; the Catholic divine refusing to chant his
! nxis-doxis-glorinxis over the dead man, as a punish-
1 meat for the lax notions he held when alive of
“goin’ to his dooty,” and the Protestant sky-pilot
objecting to use his influence with the Deity for
any but the chosen sheep of his own fold. Our
sacred respect for the majesty of the law
1 orb ids our giving fuller particulars at present
of the above case; but, rather than disappoint our
correspondent, we’ll tell of a somewhat similar
incident which occurred the last time we were in —
Timbuctoo. There are two religious sects in Tim-
buctoo—the Buddhist and the Mahometan—and
each sect entertains a pious hatred for the other
that would do credit to either Father Mahogany or
Pastor Allen. There are also two hospitals in the
city, kossed respectively by Buddhist and Mahome-
dan hakims (the extremely appropriate Arabic
term for doctors), and on the occasion we speak of
a sailor was sunstruck and fell senseless in the
middle of the Strada San Paola. He was instantly
carried to the Buddhist hospital, at the north end
of the street; but admittance was refused by the
religious janitor unless the bearers could prove,
in accordance with Rule 6 of the establishment,
that the stranger sacrificed to Buddha. Being too
much engaged in dying just then to explain his
belief in the pumpkin-headed god inside, the sailor
was brought to the Mahometan hospital at the
extreme southern end of the Strada, where his
friends were carefully informed that Rule 0 of
that establishment was precisely the same as in the
other, with the substitution of the word Mahomet
for Buddha. Being thoroughly cornered now, the
bearers placed their patient exactly half way be-
tween the two establishments, and then the
Buddhist hakim consented to examine the stranger
from the waist up, while the Mahomedan pill-
roller undertook to sound him from the waist
downwards. This was done, and marvellous as it
may appear, both physicians agreed exactly in
their diagnosis, which clearly proved the man was
dead. Then the fight began in earnest, for,
according to the laws of Timbuctoo, that hospital
nearest which a stranger dies can claim the body
for dissection. The Buddhist hakim swore that he
recognised the dead sailor as one of the most
devout worshippers of Buddha he ever saw, and
the other slaughterman was just as positive he
was a thorough neliever in Mahomet. Meantime,
however, the figure of a cross tatooed on the
breast of the corpse revealed the fact that he was
a Christian. The Buddha M.D. then contended
that the man died on the spot, “for,” he argued,
“ if he did not die then, what could have killed him
afterwards, when his honourable but not learned
friend had refused to treat him ?" And ho
certainly did fall nearer to the Buddhist
Asylum. Mahomet’s representative, however,
was of opinion that “ the stranger could not have
died so soon, because he was not admitted
into that institution presided over by his pious
but by no means experienced brother,” and he
furthermore observed that “ he had no doubt as
to the cause of death, whatever other, (he would
not say ignorant) people might have, and therefore
the patient had expired at the door of the Ma-
homedan retreat, where, through the stupidity of
the hall porter, he was refused admittance. The
argument grew hot, and the language parlia-
mentary. Lancets were drawn and blood was
about to flow, when suddenly the sailor (who, it
appears, was subject to catalepsy) sprang up, and
after emphatically damning the eyes of both
professors, quietly walked off. Then the
astonished, and disappointed hakims filed slowly
away, each deeply regretting that Rule 6 of their
Institutions was not a ilttle more elastic, “For,”
said each hakim to himself. “Had I once got
that infidel dog inside, he would not have escaped
me quite so easily.” Such is life in Tumbuctoo-
and in many other parts much nearer home.
Says Samuel Laing, M.P. for Orkney and
Shetland, in his "Rational Radicalism”:-“I began
political life more in sympathy with Sir Robert
Peel than with any otner modern statesman, and
for a long while thought Mr. Gladstone somewhat
too rash in his advances in a democratic direction-
I finish it a warm supporter of Mr. Gladstone, and
perhaps more in sympathy with Mr. Chamberlain,
if I understand his views rightly, than with any
other politician of the day.” If this merely repre-
sented the evolution of one individual mind it
would hardly be worth recording; but evidently
the same process has been going on in such a mul-
titude of other minds, as to shift the centre of
gravity of political power a long way in the direc-
tion of advanced Liberalism. The Liberal party is
already the strongest party in the country, and the
advanced or Radical section the strongest section
ot that party, and that which, by common consent
both of friends and enemies, has the largest pros-
pects for the future. Hooray!

AYER’S ’
Hair Vigor
restores, with the gloss and freshness of
youth, faded or gray hair to a natural, rich
brown color, or deep black, as may be desired.
By its use light or red hair may be darkened,
thin hair thickened, and baldness often,
though not always, cured.
It checks falling of the hair, and stimu-
lates a weak and sickly growth to vigor. It
prevents and cures scurf and dandruff, and
heals nearly every disease peculiar to the
scalp. As a Ladies’ Hair Dressing, tho
Vigor is unequalled ; it contains neither oi-1
nor dye, renders the hair soft, glossy, and
silken in appearance, and imparts a delicate,
agreeable, and lasting perfume.
Mr. C. P. Brigher writes from Kirby, O..
July 3, 1882 : “ Last fall my hair commenced
falling out, and in a short time 1 became
nearly bald. I used part of a bottle of
Ayer’s Hair Vigor, which stopped the fall-
ing of the hair, and started a new growth. I
have now a full head of hair growing vigor-
ously, and am convinced that but for the
use of your preparation I should have been
entirely'bald.”
J. W. Bowen, proprietor of the McArthur
(Ohio) Enquirer, says : “Ayer’s Hair Vigor
is a most excellent preparation for the hair.
I speak of it from my own experience. Its
use promotes the growth of new hair, and
makes it glossy and soft. The Vigor is also
a sure cure for dandruff. Not within my
knowledge has the preparation ever failed
to give entire satisfaction.”
Mr. Angus Fairbairn, leader of the
celebrated “ Fairbairn Family ” of Scottish
Vocalists, writes from Boston, Mass., Feb. 6,
1880 : “ Ever since my hair began to give sil-
very evidence of the change which fleeting
time procureth, I have used Ayer’s Hair
Vigor, and so have been able to maintain
an appearance of youthfulness — a matter of
considerable consequence to ministers, ora-
tors, actors, and in fact every one who lives
in the eyes of the public.”
Mrs, O. A. Prescott, writing from 18 Elm
St., Charlestown, Mass., April 14, 1882, says :
“ Two years ago about two-thirds of my hair
came off. It thinned very rapidly, and I was
fast growing bald. On using Ayer’s Hair
Vigor the falling stopped and a new growth
commenced, and in about a month my head
was completely covered with short hair. It
has continued to grow, and is now as good as
before it fell. I regularly used but one bottle
of the Vigor, but now use it occasionally as
a dressing.”
"We have hundreds of similar testimonials
to the efficacy of Ayer’s Hair Vigor. It
needs but a trial to convince the most skepti-
cal of its value.

The Editor Bulletin.
Dear Sib,—
I cheerfully add my testimony to the pood
clients dcriveable from the use of ST. JACOBS
OIL as demonstrated in ray own household. Some
few weeks ago my wife suffered severely from
pains in her head. Sheapplied the Oil with excel-
lent results, and has since recommended it to a
friend for a case of swelling in the legs, in which
case the result was equally beneficial. It has been
used by members of my family, and its action has
satisfied my most sanguine expectations. I con-
sider it a most valuable preparation to have by
you for any household accident. I recommend it
confidently to ray friends, and am thoroughly
satisfied “It Conquers Pain.”
I remain, yours truly,
DAVID CURTIN.
(This testimonial is from a highly respected em-
ploy 3 in the employ of Messrs. A. Hordern and
Sons, and bears the endorsement of that colossal
firm).
£100.—A Cash Reward of £100 will be paid by the
Charles A. Yogeler Company, of Baltimore, Mary-
land, U.S.A., proprietors of St. Jacobs Oil, or by
ttielr accredited local representatives in various
parts of the world, to any person producing proof
to the effect that the testimonials published by
them in regard to St. Jacobs Oil are not strictly
genuine. Price in N.S.W., Half-a-Crown a bottle.

When some-men get plenty of rope, they
save other men a great deal of trouble. This is
sometimes illustrated physically, but more often
mentally. The Rev. C. J. Byng illustrated it men-
tally one Sunday night, lately, at Fitzroy (Vic).
Ho was preaching away about temples and kings,
and wondering wiiy there weren’t more churches
in the neighbourhood, and, warming up, he pro-
pounded the statement that the absence of
churches meant absolute godlessness. This may
be true, or may not. But, as he continued to
warm up, he struck out for a graphic picture of
heaven. His picture was not the worst one im-
aginable, but there wasn’t the shadow of a church
in it. That fitted in badly with what he had said
before; but he made it worse by observiig that
“the absence of churches in heaven meant the
absence of ignorance, superstition, and sectarian-
ism.” This is true Now, what did he actually
prove? Was it not that the earth will be more
like heaven when all the Byngs are bungs ?
Recently the engineers of the Italian
mercantile marine struck for higher wages, where-
upon the Government, instead of allowing the
price of the labour in question to bo settled in
upon market by the laws of supply and demand,
gave orders that the Naval Arsenals should pro-
vide engineers for the merchant steamers in want
of them during the continuance of the strike. So
“imperial” a policy will naturally meet with the
approbation of Jingo capitalists the wide world
over; but we’re very much inclined to think
persistence In it on the part of Humbert’s advisers
will create such a state of things in the larger
manufacturing and commercial cities of Italy as
will require all His Majesty’s soldiers and sailors
and rural guards to controi. For a Government
to interfere in such a way in su,ch a question is to
teach the people that the use of brute force Is
preferable to that of calm argument, a lesson that
perchance the people may some day in some spasm
of excitement prove they have profited by.
Some British electoral statistics : England
and Wales have 966,721 county, and 1,651,732
borough electors; Scotland 99,652 county, and
210,789 borough electors: Ireland 165,997 county,
and borough electors 53,021. These figures give
grand totals of 2,618,453 for England and Wales;
310,441 for Scotland, and 224,018 lor Ireland. Ireland
possesses 86,423 electors less than Scotland,
although Ireland has a population of 5,174,836 (in
1881) with 914,108 inhabited houses; while Scotland
has a population of 3,728,124, with 739,005 inhabited
houses. The largest English electorate is in
Liverpool, where it numbers 63,430; Marlborough
having the smallest, 636. Glasgow has the largest
electorate in Scotland, numbering 63,716, or slightly
more than Liverpool. In Ireland, Mayo county
has 215,217 Inhabitants and 3088 electors; while
Down county has 12,619 electors, with a population
of 233,164, or some 10,000 less than Mayo. Again,
Belfast has 21,805 electors, with a population of
208.122; while Dublin, with a population of 273,282,
has but 13,580 electors. These are a few of the
monstrous anomalies that it is hoped the promised
Reform Bill will remove.
Some of those wicked, democratic, social-
istic Skye crofters are going from bad to worse.
They have actually issued a manifesto containing
the atrocious declaration that they decline to
starve to servo the interests of an absentee land-
lord. Wo are sure John Brown would have dis-
owned such miscreants as his fellow-countrymen.
These abominable scoundrels—the cottersof Elgol,
to wit—say: “ Wo have our iot in course of Provi-
dence cast in a most outlandish part of Skye,
where wo are deprived of all means to enable us
to live with any degree of comfort, while there
are hundreds of acres of uncultivated land in the
possession of one English gentleman in our neigh-
bourhood, and wo arc denied one single patch of
ground wherein to plant potatoes or sow seed.
. . . We have hitherto been a law-abiding
people; but if our ■grievances are not redressed,
and that very soon, we shall be compelled to take
our living out of the hundreds or acres above
mentioned. We are all inclined to pay a fair rent
for the land which wo intend to use.” These
Elgol cotters would probably render “fiat juelitia,
mat calum,” “ Do us justice, or Sky(e) shall make
you ruo it.”
What, ho! A now St. George for England
—a George the Fifth (as Labouchere says)—Henry
George (of “ Poverty and Progress ”) to wit, with
the legend on his banner ‘ The Land for the
People !” The burden of his message is severely
simple. Let taxation be thrown on the laud. Let
the rent of the land go to the States, to supply
wherewithal W pay the whole public expend!
ture, and to abolish all poverty save such as
is the result of personal vice. Ho compensa-
tion will George give the landlords when the
State resumes the ownership of the land, ihe
forefathers of the landlords robbed the forefathers
of the people. Because a man robbed yesterday
and the day before,, does that give him a right to
continue his robbery into the future ? A proper
question, by George ! Here is one instance out of
ten thousand thousand of the sort of robbery that
has been going on in England for centuries (we
quote from a leading London paper)Edward
Alleyne, the actor, gave half a crown an acre for
1800 acres of land, at Dulwich, about the time ot
James I. He devised it to establish a ‘ College ot
God’s gift,’ and to maintain a certain number of
old men and women. The college is now a public
school, and the estate is partially covered by pala-
tial mansions ot City swells, who pay rentals of
£200 a-year, which they get repaid in the cost of
the education of their sons, that at Eton or Har-
row would be equal to their rent. There are poor
boys in the college. There is ‘a lower school ’ tor
them—or, rather, fora few foundation boys; but
the foundationers are to bo abolished, and the
lower middle class have possession ©f the school
under a charity ‘scheme.’ i ho poor have been
ousted from Dulwich, and have carried their
wretchedness elsewhere. Some of it may be
found in Southwark, from whence comes the
Bitter Cry ; or over the way, m St. Saviour’s,
where Edward Alleyne acted at the Globe Theatre.
He wished to benefit the poor of the four parishes
in which he was born, apprenticed, acted, and
died. Dives and Croesus have appropriated what
be left under the head of Progress. Wo have,to
seek for the result in the Poverty of the slums.’
And still the evil grows, not only in England but
in all countries that have assimilated their land
systems to the accursed British system. George
has told us that the result of five hundred years of
wrong dealing with the land in England, lias been
realUed in 35 yea.ru in California. Wo know what
close on a hundred years has realised in Sydney,
where hundreds of “miserables” herd in slums
that abut upon allotments worth a quarter of a
million a piece. Under the old Georgian era—an
eraot monopoly, favouritism, and corruption—the
evil made hideous development in the old country;
let us hope under the new one it will be utterly
abolished—scotched and killed outright by the
application of some practical modillcation of the
Fifth George’s “ thorough ” policy.

The Sailor King, who was always coarse, and some-
times silly enough to merit his nickname of "Silly
Billy,” had an eye for the main chance. He was
always brooding over the possibilities of personally
appropriating the moneys outside the Civil Service
votes. He allowed Dorothy Jordan, the mother of
his bastards, to die of want in a foreign land ; the
bastards he quartered on the British taxpayer, as
above shown. When the gallant prince, by the
grace of God Defender of the Faith, et Bman-
niarum (whose people never, never, or hardly
ever will be slaves) Rex, and so on, was about to
sign the formal declaration of his succession to the
throne, vacant by the decease ot the “First Gentle-
man in Europe.” he remarked with touching
pathos to the Clerk of his Council, “This is a
d d bad pen you have given me.” 1 act is, the
Reform King seldom deviated into decency. . His
eldest son, the first Earl of Munster (more patriotic
than his papa), committed suicide in 1843.

Mr. John Hunter’s New City Boot
Palace.
There is not the slightest doubt that the public of
Sydney and this colony generally are indebted to
the enterprise of one or two mon for the extra-
ordinarily liberal charges which now rule in the
retail boot market. Six years ago, this
city was in this respect the heaviest taxed in the
Australian colonies, notwithstanding our free port
and the admitted activity of our factories. About
the period mentioned, Mr, John Hunter,
was the first to di:cover this fact, and
ha rightly conjectured that there was a great
opening in Sydney for a mammoth retail boot
warehouse, where the public could obtain the
fullest concessions in prices to which they were
entitled. Ho accordingly opened business in
George-street, and at once struck a blow
at th) monopolies which had existed here
undisturbed tor years. For a considerable period
he stood alone in his great reductions in prices,
but, after a time, one house after another followed
—till there was, at any rate, a fair all-round re-
duction. It was impossible, however, tor the low
tariff of charges adopted by Mr. Hunter to be
reached by others. First he kept exclusively to
the boot-trade, not hampering it with other
1 branches, and in his business he invested a largo
1 capital, which gave him command of every mar-
I ket in the colonies and in Europe. The City Boot
Palace is the principal effort of this enterprising
1 business man, and certainly no house started in
this city for the last thirty years has been more
i triumphantly successful. The City Boot Palace
i has an average daily attendance of the public
j of near upon two thousand people ; and the
business has now so rapidly extended that
Mr. Hunter has been compelled to enter upon
the splendid new premises shown in the ac-
companying engraving. This magnificent edi-
fice stands at the corner of George and Market-
streets, directly opposite the Markets, and occupies
the site of the George-street end of the famous
Waterloo Stores (D. Cooper and Co.’s). This grand
extension of the City Boot Palace is in keeping
with the liberal spirit of enterprise which has
characterised Mr. Hunter’s business career in
Sydney. The establishment is the best boot
mart ‘in all Australasia, and is not surpassed
even in London, Paris, or New York. It has a
splendid frontage to George and Market-streets,
the show-windows being wide and high, ad-
mitting of capital display and a perfect
flood of light. The main entrance is exactly at
-the corner, with an additional door in George-
street, and the view presented on entering will be
found to be the grandest and most attractive in
the colonics. The space for business is unusually
largo, and is ornamented with pillars, supporting
arches, which will be so fitted as to admit of the
display of goods for sale. The features of this
emporium which immediately strike a visitor are
its spaciousness and its splendid light; and as the
interior is to be fitted with carved cedar show-
cases, wherein the best and handsomest produc-
tions in boots and shoes are to be displayed, the
effect can be better imagined than described. A
portion of these new premises will be exclusively
devoted to the requirements of ladies and children,
and in this respect will have every privacy and
convenience, and will be very elegantly fitted up.
The goods which Mr» Hunter has from time to
time introduced to the Sydney public are well
! known for their genuineness in durability and
i elegance, and the low figure at which they have
I been offered. The variety, great as it has been,
i will, however, be increased by new lines from
I English and Continental bouses. The latest pat-
terns of the English sewn boot, to the artistic
hand-painted productions of the Continental work,
men, will be found placed here at figures the same
as rule in London and Paris. The practical re-
quirements of every household will, however, re-
ceive the greatest attention, and with the English
and French manufactures in this line will be found
the productions from his own extensive
factory in Sydney. The new establishment win
be opened in a tew days, of which fact the public
will have due notice. In addition,to the retail
houses in Sydnsy, Mr. Hunter has extensive
branches in Newcastle, Adelaide, and Launceston,
in each place his establishment being among the
first in architectural and mercantile importance,
and a very extensive branch establishment
is shortly to be opened in Goulburn. Mr.
Hunter likewise carries on ii Sydney one of
the most extensive manufacturing and import
businesses. The import warehouse is in W yn .
yard-square, and is one of the handsomest
and most commodious amoog the splendid new
edifices in that quarter of the city. The importa-
tions include the largest lines of English and Con-
tidental bootware, and for tho purposes of this
branch of bis business he has resident London and
Parisian buyers. In this respect Mr. Hunter does
almost the main trade of the city, and his business
relations extend to almost every town and city i n
each colony. The colonial manufacturing works
are situated at Waterloo, and steady employment
is given to 150 hands. In tho import branches, Mr.
Hunter extends to retail customers in the conn-
try tho very same advantages secured to his own
reUil establishments, thus offering an induceinect
to further extensions of his business. Mr. Hunter
is represented by his travellers in all the inland
dis riots of this and the adjoining colonies.
