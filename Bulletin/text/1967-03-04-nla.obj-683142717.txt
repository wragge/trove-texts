the most thick skinned cars in the world
A BMC car, and BMC alone, gives you the investment and safety protection of
Rotodip 7 skin deep rust protection. Rotodip is unique because car bodies actually
rotate through special cleaning and rustproofing solutions. Result: no air pockets
can form; every inch of the body, inside and out is treated. Rust (it starts on the
inside) can’t form, can’t weaken the inherent body strength of your car. Rotodip
rust protection is one reason why your BMC car is safer. Others: BMC's better
front wheel handling, better braking, unique stay-on-line Hydrolastic* fluid
suspension. You buy a safe car, an advanced car when you buy BMC. There’s one
to suit your needs exactly!

WYNNS
ESTATE
WINE
The wine growers story of favoured vintages.
Coonawarra Estate
’66 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’66
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963
at Coonawarra was
unusually humid, which
seems to have added
subtlety to the wine, giving
it greater delicacy, yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove
to be the best Australian
Hermitage ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’6O Cabernet
Made entirely from the rare
Cabernet Sauvignon grape,
this Cabernet was matured at
the Estate for two years in
oak and then further bottle-
matured for four years before
being released for sale. With
a pronounced Cabernet nose,
this wine is full and soft on
the palate, with a firm tannin
finish.
Modbury Estate
’65 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz, pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’65 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

Catholic Schools
Your article on Catholic schools
(8., Feb. 4) is incomplete since it does
not discuss the alternative to survival,
the State Governments’ financial and
logistic abilities to absorb or take over
the Catholic School system.
In Western Australia the overflow of
Catholic children to State schools has
risen by some 10,000 pupils since 1949,
i.e., one-third of estimated Catholic
children of school age. These cost State
Government $2,400,000 per annum.
Government payments, subsidies, and
services to children in Catholic schools
is at present $BOO,OOO per annum. A
further $600,000 per annum would
arrest the obviously expensive overflow
and even reverse it. The State would
save money thereby and retain for itself
the full vitality and variety contributed
to Australian education by Catholic
schools.
Australian Catholic parents are
united in their desire for Catholic
schools for their children, even the
about one-third of Catholics who by
voting DLP at the Federal election
exerted a de facto opposition to the
60 cents per week ALP proposal which
would at the moment spell salvation to
the Parochial school system.
PAUL DONNELLY
Claremont (W.A.J
It is easy to claim that the spirit
of the Second Vatican Council justi-
fied all sorts of attitudes. However, I
see that John Manning has failed to
justify his claim that Catholic schools
are no longer necessary, and I challenge
him to support his claims by quotations
from the Council’s Decrees, particularly
the one on Christian Education.
There have always been those who
claim that Catholic schools were not
necessary, but they have filled a need
for over fifteen hundred years. If
Catholic schools do collapse from sheer
monetary starvation, it will be a poor
commentary on Christian charity.
D. A. CUMMING
Epping (N.S.W.)
Your article on the problems of
Catholic Education (8., Feb. 4) shows
a knowledge of the situation that is
not possessed by many.
Your writer has thrown down the
gauntlet and asked Catholics to show
why they still need Catholic schools in
this age. It is an evocative article, chal-
lenging and most interesting.

Ugly Universities
I was interested in Professor
Mitchell's comment (8., Feb. 11) “we
should have a quarter of a million
more books in the Macquarie Univer-
sity library because we built without
frills.” Whilst I can only agree that
books are vitally important in a univer-
sity, surely the Professor knows that
environment, too, is vital in the
learning-teaching process, as it is to
every other aspect of our lives.
Almost all the recently built univer-
sity buildings are such that they fail to
fulfil the basic needs, other than mere
accommodation, of university buildings
as I understand them. We are faced
with a rapidly expanding population
at a time when we are in the depths
of what I fancy history will record as
one of our worst periods of aesthetic
understanding. Robin Boyd has written
of the Australian Ugliness, but fails to
make clear that it is becoming self-
perpetuating and universities are
contributing more than their fair share
to the overall lowering of standards,
not only of aesthetics but of attitudes,
behaviour, and way of thinking.
We need to establish at universities
perhaps the highest environmental
standards in the community. Our
students are now drawn from a wide
range of backgrounds, many with a
very limited experience of the really
fine things that man is capable of
creating; and these are the people who
will be, among others, the initiators,
developers, and controllers of our
future environment and way of life.

TV Commercials
I was fascinated to read Charles
Higham’s article on the making of
television “commercials” (8., Feb. 11),
particularly in regard to the “eye
camera” technique of gauging viewer
reaction to the films. Shades of “1984”
indeed!
Ingenious as this device is, I defy
anyone to invent one powerful enough
to penetrate the glaze of boredom over
our pupils after being subjected ,to the
endless repetition of these little gems
of dramatic presentation.

Writers’ Retreat
It was with distress nay! despair
that I read Mr. Geoffrey Leh-
mann’s article (8., Feb. 11) on the
Armidale Writers’ Retreat. The idyllic
vision of writers all producing mar-
vellous literature during their short
Armidale sojourn must be one of the
isolated triumphs of mass organisation.
I congratulate Mr. Lehmann on his
perception in recognising Mr. Kenneth
Slessor and Judith Wright as being
two of the major poets of this century.
I hope Mr. Slessor is successful in
inventing an “Australian way of
speech” (after all, why speak- Eng-
lish?). Why, however, Judith Wright
bothers in her poetry to follow a line
which has already been developed to
its ultimate fulfilment by Rilke can only
be guessed at.
Anxiously I look forward to the type-
writer picnic to be held later this
year and also to Mr. Lehmann, after it
is over, sounding on his bugle the ad-
vance of another Writers’ Retreat.
VILMOR RUDOLPH

Buckley’s Poems
L. B. Grant, in taking exception to
my review of Vincent Bucklev’s
“Arcady and Other Places” (8., Feb.
18), seems to be accusing me of “the
politicisation of everything,” which
James McAuley nominates as the very
process Buckley stands against. Grant
uses only one example in his argument
an example drawn from the “Eleven
Political Poems.” What of the other
43 poems in the collection? But here,
as elsewhere, my comments are about
society, not politics.
To accept a. society does not mean
to accept all its vices. In contesting
this, it is Mr. Grant who is being too
political, too theoretical and Utopian.
He himself admits: “Buckley’s heart is
not in Utopia . . . only in Australia,”
also that the hard-faced men (censured
in “No New Thing”) are “. . . here
in this society, with all their social
vices.” Therefore the poet’s criticisms
of our society are from the standpoint
of basic, if conditional, acceptance; as
I said in the first place.
As I see it, Mr. Grant’s argument
arises from his having identified what
Vincent Buckley specifically attacks,
but having failed to identify what he
implicitly accepts.
RODNEY HALL
Brisbane (Qld.)
Ned Kelly
Your correspondent Mr. Dyson-
Firth (8., Feb. 11) accused me of be-
ing “appallingly inaccurate” in my
defence of Ned Kelly. However, his
language is rather stronger than his
facts. He believes that Ned Kelly was
first wounded immediately before he
fell (shortly before 8.00 a.m.). Kelly
was initially wounded nearly six hours
before this during the first volleys of
the Glenrowan fight. He suffered a
multiple wound in the left arm and a
wound in the left foot from shots fired
either by Superintendent Hare or Con-
stable Canny.
Ned Kelly took the grey mare
Music from the hotel’s horse paddock
and rode from the siege to meet his
sympathisers. He returned to the hotel
at 5.00 a.m., and then again passed
out through the police lines. He fell
shortly before 8.00 a.m., in what the
police interpreted as an attempt to
drive the besieging force from the back
and rear of the pub so that the two
surviving members of the gang could
escape.
IAN JONES
Camberwell (Vic.)
Mr. Dyson-Firth (8., Feb. 11) speaks
of appalling inaccuracies in lan Jones’'
defence of Ned Kelly and then shows
that he has no knowledge of the facts
himself. Ned was already wounded
when he escaped during the night. On
Saturday, about four hours later, he
made a stand against overwhelming
odds. He could have escaped but chose
to return and die fighting.
Ned Kelly will always be an Aus-
tralian legend along with many other
famous “wild colonials.” Would the
critics rather bury everything exciting
in our history and perhaps just adopt
the Western completely? Or perhaps
we could keep up the legends of those
Kings of England; after all, they only
murdered women and children.
PETER CUFFLEY
Ferntree Gully (Vic.)
Conscientious Objectors
You edited my sardonic letter (8.,
Jan. 21) in such a way that it was
easily misunderstood, as evidenced by
Chas. Norton’s letter (8., Feb. 18).
May I point out that I approve of
conscientious objection.
However, my point about Brian
Buckley is this: if, after having been
a conscientious objector, he is now pre-
pared to propagandise for conscription
to Vietnam, he ought, at least, to join
the CMF. He should be very suitable:
I know him personally to be both
brave and pugnacious.
JAMES GRIFFIN
Kew (Vic.)
Foo Flies
Articles on scientific subjects for the
masses usually provide a certain amount
of innocent amusement, and are harm-
less if they are not actually misleading.
The relationshiD between flies and
human disease (8., Feb. 11) was pre-
sented in a manner neither amusing nor
informed. To say that no such relation-
ship has ever been proved is frankly
ludicrous. Flies’ important part in the
spread among mankind of the diseases
which affect the gastro-intestinal tract
is well established. The combination
of a modern, closed sewerage system
and a fly-control program will do much
to reduce gastro-enteritis in the com-
munity, although this is only one facet
of the problem.

Growing with Australia- for Australians
THE AUSTRALIAN
COMPANY


Face of the Week
Seven Australian soldiers were
killed and 27 wounded in Vietnam.
It was a week of intense bushfire
danger in Victoria, and in one fire
eight houses were burned and 14
persons injured. Federal Cabinet
decided to go ahead with the referen-
dum on numbers in the Senate and
House of Representatives, with a
general redistribution of electorates.
British Secretary of State for Com-
monwealth Affairs, Herbert Bowden,
arrived in Canberra for talks on a
possible British fail-back base in Aus-
tralia. Good to torrential rains fell
in S.A. and parts of the Northern
Territory, while cyclone Barbara
brought beneficial rain to Queens-
land and northern N.S.W. A Women
Jurors Bill was introduced in the
Queensland Parliament. Seamen re-
fused to sail the Boonaroo to Viet-
nam with munitions, and the
Government threatened to man her
with Navy.
★ ★ ★
Princess Alexandra arrived in Aus-
tralia for a ten-day private visit with
her husband. Subsidiary companies
were formed in Sydney and Mel-
bourne to serve off-shore oil rigs by-
ship and helicopter. Commonwealth
building approvals were up about 24
percent compared with January of
1966. The W.A. search for American
Biosatellite I was abandoned. British
racing driver Jackie Stewart won the
Australian Grand Prix for 1967, and
a visiting team of French swimmers
won several events in the Australian
national titles in Adelaide. Govern-
ment fisheries’ policies were criticised
at the Australian Fisheries Develop-
ment Conference in Canberra. Sir
Robert Menzies returned from a four
months’ visit to the United States.
★ ★ ★
Senator D. C. Hannaford, of South
Australia, resigned from the Liberal
Party because he disagreed with its
Vietnam policy. The first Common-
wealth Loan without a set target
closed at $204 million. Disputes over
airlines’ clerks salaries caused brief
stoppages and led to a conference
to prevent a strike. Twenty charter
airline companies had applied to the
Commonwealth for the right to offer
mini-airline services to outpost towns.
The N.S.W. Government appointed
a senior police official to lead a drive
against hooliganism in Sydney. The
Post Office’s electronic letter-sorting
machines in Sydney were shown to
chew up letters with metal objects
inside them. A final decision on the
use of the main hall of the Opera
House was deferred again. Australia
was all out for 173 in the first
innings of the Fifth Test against
South Africa. Mr. Holt set March
28 as his departure date for a two-
week Asian tour.

MARCH 4. 1967
Does it Matter
Who Owns Australia?
TT is shrewd i politics for the
Federal Government to
announce that it wants to increase
Australian ownership and control
of major development projects.
One of the most explosive political
issues of the future is embedded in
this very question. If things drift
on as they are, we might later find
ourselves humiliated by a sense of
betrayal and sell-out.
Beyond questions of political
expediency, it is also surely in our
general interest that the exploita-
tion of our natural resources should
be a matter over which we our-
selves have the main control.
Otherwise, international companies
can use Australian mineral develop-
ment as part of their own inter-
national politics, stopping or
starting in accord with their own
interests instead of ours, or even
perhaps fiddling prices to their own
advantage.
If we lacked capital entirely, it
might be a different matter, but
presumably one of the questions
the Government has in mind is that
there is money lying around in
Australia doing nothing much, and
that it should be channelled into
national development. Superannua-
tion and life assurance funds are
one example: perhaps the best
examples of idle money are the
statutory deposits in the Reserve
Bank. Some overseas companies
actually finance their activities by
borrowing Australian money at
fixed interest; it might make more
sense if we lent this money to our-
selves. So far as skills are con-
cerned: if we lack some of the
skills needed for development, there
is always a price at which we can
hire them from overseas.
We should remember that, as
well as economic questions, there
are really sound social reasons why
a nation should control a signifi-
cant part of its own economic
activity. A situation in which
almost every individual economic
decision was made for us in the
U.S.A., Britain, Western Europe,
or Japan would be a semi-colonial
situation: it would mean that we
were a nation of petty officers, of
middle executives able to imple-
ment decisions but not to frame
them, a nation of nongs, bereft
of originality and initiative, unused
to final responsibilities.
To take one example of the
reverse case: if it had not been for
the cultivation of executive origi-
nality in the B.H.P. and other
Australian-owned enterprises earlier
in the century, we would have been
incapable of improvising an arma-
ments industry as splendidly as we
did in World War 11. In a
society such as ours, in which busi-
ness leadership is so important, the
whole society suffers if all the sig-
nificant business leadership comes
from foreign nations.
For the rest of this century, be-
cause of our geographic position,
we face invigorating possibilities of
developing a new kind of national
consciousness, of becoming a new
kind of people, more assured in
our ways, more confident in our
role. We are less likely to do this
if we let some of the most sig-
nificant decision-making in our
country slip out of our hands.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Harold Wilson’s
Australian Shadow Play
A writer in the London “Sunday Times” once described Mr. Harold Wilson’s
political style as being like the last scenes in an old Foreign Legion movie. In
an otherwise deserted fort one lone legionnaire runs from rampart to rampart
letting off guns, to give the impression that the fort is still manned.
Australian observers saw something
of this last week when Mr. Herbert
Bowden, the British Commonwealth
Secretary, announced in Melbourne that
Britain might like to establish a “fall
back” base in Australia.
They suggested that this might be
part of Mr. Wilson’s Shadow Play in
the withdrawal to West-of-Suez the
setting up of bases and the announce-
ment that troops might be flown to
them, so that it can be demonstrated
to the Americans, and those people in
Britain who care, that Britain was still
playing some role in this part of the
world.
Australian policy is to try to encour-
age the British to stay in Malaysia and
Singapore for as long as can be man-
aged. Now that Sukarno’s “Crush
Malaysia” campaign has ended, the im-
mediate security need is small. But
something might crop up, and in the
meantime the presence of British forces
in this area, and the maintenance of
the base in Singapore, may help to
stabilise relations between Singapore
and Malaysia.
It certainly helps to stabilise Singa-
pore’s economy. In the present situation,
in which neither Malaysia nor Indo-
nesia has resumed full trading relations
with Singapore, a sizable proportion
of Singapore’s wealth comes from the
British base and in American pro-
curements for Vietnam.
But where the Australian Government
wants the British to stay is in Singapore
and Malaysia not in Australia. There
is considerable scepticism in Canberra
about the idea of a “fail-back base,”
of the British being expelled from
Singapore and falling back on Aus-
tralia. It seems as likely that the Singa-
pore Government would expel the
British from Singapore as that Aus-
tralians would expel their sheep
industry. It is suggested that discussions
on a “fall-back base” are really dis-
cussions on a way of keeping the shad-
ows dancing after effective withdrawal.
There is one exception to this. The
Australian Government is interested in
discussing with the British the use of
air bases either existing or planned
—in Northern Australia for V-Bombers.
It may finally prove that these become
the last immediate strategic link left
between Britain and Australia.
There is some Government concern
about the idea of a tiny force of
British troops being stationed some-
where in Australia. Their effective use
to Australia would be somewhere near
nil, although they might be of domestic
political use to a British Government,
something to point to for political pur-
poses. For Australia the main result of
Herbert Bowden
such an arrangement might be a
strengthening of residual distrust
among Asian nations.
And there would be difficulties for
Australians. It has already bedn pointed
out that it might seem strange for the
British to base a few troops in Aus-
tralia while our own forces were fighting
in Vietnam.
Butter Issues
The Australian dairy industry, in
1967, appears to be facing the kind
of change which confronted European
and English arable farmers when the
American and Canadian prairies were
opened up in the 1870 s, ’Bos, and ’9os.
Butter, as an export to highly self-
sufficient European countries, is in for
a difficult time, made worse by the
likely entry of Britain into the Com-
mon Market. And at home the Mrs.
Joneses will ask why housewives can-
not buy cheaper margarine or cheaper
N.Z. butter. "
This is part of the background to
the fourth five-year dairy stabilisation
plan, which is to be negotiated this
year between the Commonwealth
Government and the dairy industry.
The position is made worse by the
fact that milk consumption by Aus-
tralians appears to be falling.
Latest figures show that in Victoria,,
the most efficient dairying State, con-
sumption of milk per person dropped
from a daily intake of 0.685 pints in
1962 to 0.648 in 1966.
And “long-life milk”—the hope for
the future will also have its prob-
lems. Development of this milk pro-
cess (already well past the experimental
stage) could prove a bigger headache
for the industry than even margarine
and Mrs. Jones. It could, in theory,
make farming more profitable and
pleasant (no need to keep up quotas
in mid-winter by expensive hand feed-
ing), yet it could also mean oblivion
for many ancillary dairying enter-
prises, including the milkman on his
daily round.
As to why we have to have another
five-year dairy stabilisation plan this
year: there is nothing which says it
has to be another five-year plan at
all. The five-year plan system came
into being in 1952. Various dairy
stabilisation plans existed between 1926
and 1952 and the five-year agreement
appears to be in no way mandatory.
With the industry facing traumatic
changes, a shorter-term agreement —•
leaving room for rapid adjustment
would appear to offer advantages.
The Commonwealth has before it
two submissions from dairy farmers—•
o.ne from the Australian Dairy Coun-
cil and one from the Australian Pri-
mary Producers’ Union. The Council
seeks a continuation of the present
subsidy, about $27 million a year.
The APPU seeks a subsidy “adjusted
to 1958 values,” which puts their new
bid at around $36 million.
These figures are, however, only part
of the story and because of the com-
plexity of the dairy subsidy, which
includes a direct subsidy, a Common-
wealth guarantee to underwrite initial
butter equalisation payments, and
measures to assist cheese and manu-
factured milk product exports such
as casein, the real extent of the tax-
payer’s contribution to dairying is dif-
ficult to assess.
Farmers’ organisations, when ; they
discuss subsidies, never include the
whole range of taxation benefits
afforded them and the provisions
exempting them from sales tax on a
wide range of goods. At the same
time, they would contest the inclusion
of the superphosphate bounty which
costs the taxpayer around $25 million
a year.
Farm subsidies are always complex
because the farmer is sometimes a dairy
farmer pure and simple, and some-
times a beef raiser, grain grower, and
pig farmer as well. There are even
some (and their number will swell)
who produce milk and grow safflower
for the oil seed trade at one and the
same time they hold Mrs. Jones’


hand and Daisy’s teat simultaneously,
as it were.
As it stands, a reasonable guess
would be that both claims, although
one is for $27 million a year and the
other for $36 million, are much the
same and would be for neither of the
figures mentioned, but for something
more like $6O million, by the time
they include indirect subsidies, such
as margarine quotas.
One reform the Government could
introduce this year would be to release
an audited statement of the subsidy,
bounty, levy, equalisations, and other
sections of the whole dairy subsidy.
This would show that it is not
altogether a one-way street, that the
industry, in turn, provides funds for
a series of research and extension
activities. Above all, it would tell the
taxpayer where his money goes.

Migrants
Sub - section 7: Immigration of
southern Europeans, procedure for pro-
crastination.
(i) Southern European migrants are
often unskilled and therefore as a
whole are less desirable than British
and northern-European migrants.
(iv) It is not the practice of the
Department to discriminate against
Europeans on grounds other than those
of general health, therefore it should be
fully explained to the officials of
foreign Governments, to the Press, and
to intending southern - European
migrants, especially the darker-skinned
and more hirsute among them, that the
only barrier to their migration is that
they are unskilled . . .
The above regulation and procedures,
let us hasten to add, are inventions of
THE BULLETIN, but not without
some symbolic significance.
The Greek Democritus League knows
this and that is why it claimed last week
that the Australian Government dis-
criminates against intending Greek and
Italian migrants.
The figures on assisted migration sup-
port the charge. In the period 1945 to
1966, 75 percent of German migrants
received assistance from the Australian
Government, as did 51 percent of
British migrants, 50 percent of Dutch,
and 50 percent of Hungarians. In con-
trast, only 27 percent of Greeks and 13
percent of Italians were assisted.
The Immigration Department, of
course, denied that there was dis-
crimination. The whole matter of
assisted immigration depended on both
the bi-lateral assistance given by the
migrant’s own country and on whether
or not the migrant was “skilled.” The
official ritual having been performed,
everybody went back about his business
not believing a word of the denial. The
Government, the Immigration Depart-
ment, the average white Anglo-Saxon
Protestant in the street, and the Greek
and Italian communities, all know that
skilled or unskilled, Australia prefers
its migrants to come from the north of
the Tiber, and, if possible, north of the
Alps.
Immigration Department officials are
informed, in various direct and indirect
ways, not to encourage too many short,
dark, swarthy people out of Calabria
or the valleys of Thessaly. One way and
another word gets around and the chaps
in the right places get the message. So
have the Greeks and Italians.

Sir Robert Said it First
From ALAN REID in Canberra
The heat engendered in the Parliament last week over the legislation increasing
the Federal Ministry from 25 to 26 had its amusing aspects, especially in Clyde
Cameron’s speech on Ministers and their departments.
South Australian Clyde Cameron
embarked upon a quite brilliant piece
of mischief making, adroitly praising
every one in the Liberal Party who
felt that his merits had been insuffici-
ently recognised when Ministerial
appointments were under consideration
and seeking to drive a wedge between
the Liberals and their junior partners,
the Country Party members.
But the debate had its serious aspect
as well. While I agree with Senator
Wood, who reluctantly reached the con-
clusion that the Government had a
mandate to increase the Ministry by one
to provide the Minister for Common-
wealth Education, pledged during its
election campaign, it is pretty clear that
the Ministry could do with considerable
rationalisation.
There is only a very remote possi-
bility of the Federal Ministry ever
being reduced from its new level of
26. Human nature being what it is,
even the most vocal Parliamentary
critics of the enlargement of the
Cabinet are unlikely to press for reduc-
tions if they were transferred from
their present positions of impotence to
the seats of power.
Though Labor opposed the enlarge-
ment it would not be likely to do
anything if it were occupying the
Government instead of the Opposition
benches. “Jobs for the boys” is still
an important element in keeping fol-
lowers happy and loyal.
But even if it is recognised that a
Ministry of 26 has from last week
become part of the Australian scene,
rationalisation of the activities of those
Ministries would not be amiss.
Cameron was at his destructive best
in his speech. He told new member
lan Wilson (who succeeded his father,
Sir Keith Wilson, in the South Aus-
tralian seat of Sturt) that despite his
brilliance as a Rhodes Scholar and in
topping the S.A. Law examinations
Clyde Cameron
year after year, he would never get into
the Ministry “unless he crawls to the
Prime Minister and becomes a mouse
instead of a man.”
He included Liberals William Went-
worth and Harry Turner, both from
N.S.W., and Liberal Geoff Giles, a
fellow South Australian all passed
over for the Ministry as men whose
qualities merited a better fate.
With relish Cameron produced these
quotes from the former Prime Minister,
Sir Robert Menzies. Cameron credited
Menzies with having said, “I have yet
to learn that to be Postmaster-General
and nothing else is a heavy job because
on the whole I would think that the
postal department was best run by a
Postmaster-General who was deaf and
dumb.”
Of the Navy Minister, Cameron
quoted Menzies as saying, “All I can
say is that the Minister for the Navy
will not die of overwork he will
probably die of inanition.” On the
Army Minister, the Cameronian versiQn
of Menzies was, “If I desired the per-
fect definition of a cushy job I should
like to be Minister for the Army.”
But in between Cameron’s mischief-
making and denigration of Ministers
and their tasks was a lot of common-
sense. Cameron started with the basic
proposition that he would prefer to
have too many Ministers than too few.
As he pointed out, if you do not have
enough then those Ministers you do
have must lean to an increasing extent
on departmental heads a situation
which produces remoteness on the
Minister’s part from the ordinary every
day problems of the average citizen.
But Cameron then added some tell-
ing points. He pointed out that the
Minister of Repatriation was a rubber
stamp for his Department. He had
yet to receive from a Minister for
Repatriation (any Minister for Repat-
riation, and Cameron has been in
Parliament since 1949) a reply saying
that he had altered the decision of any
of the tribunals or authorities attached
to his department.
Cameron challenged without
securing a response any Member
who had been able to get the Minister
to upset a Commission decision to
stand up and let him (Cameron) have
a look at him, because this Member
would have achieved something that
Cameron had never been able to
achieve.
~With considerable commonsense,
Cameron added that this situation
(with the Commission rather than the
Minister making the decisions) was
perhaps a good thing. Repatriation
Sir Robert Menzies
pensions and things of that nature
were perhaps matters on which it was
better to have an impersonal decision
from a Commission (which was not
influenced by pressures) than from an
individual exposed to political pressures.
But if this was the situation,
Cameron argued, there was a real case
for amalgamating the Repatriation
Department with Social Services, so-
that portfolios should be made avail-
able for the really important things at
which Government should be looking
in an expanding country.
Cameron also argued that Civil
Aviation should be attached to the
present portfolio of Shipping and
Transport, and its status enlarged. As
he pointed out, Wentworth, not a
Minister and working through the
imperfect instrument of Parliamentary
committees, had secured rail stand-
ardisation between Sydney and Mel-
bourne an achievement larger than
any Transport Minister with all his
retinue could point to.
Much of Australia’s national product
was consumed by transport costs. Even
a saving of one percent in this field
could provide Australia with sufficient
money to extend its social service
benefits.
In the Senate, while debating the
same legislation, DLP Senator Vince
Gair (Qld.) himself an experienced
administrator he was Premier of
Queensland for years shrewdly
observed that the appointment of an
extra Minister did not mean just the
appointment of a Minister. It meant
an entire department.
“Around him (the new Minister)
grow officers of the department and
with them grows additional expendi-
ture in the form of allowances,
travelling costs, cars, and the inciden-
tal costs which amount to so much,”
said Gair. “It will not be long before
the new department will grow and
grow.”
The Government got Parliamentary
approval for an extra Minister to be
added to the Ministry’s strength. But
at the same time it could be a
reminder (which I in my pessimism
am confident will be ignored) that a
very good case can be made out for a
careful reorganisation of Ministries
and Ministers’ functions.

Petrol: up
The big oil companies are simply
not keeping up with the industrial
Joneses.
When the State price commissioners
who control the price of petrol soften
their hearts toward the oil industry it
is usually for the benefit of the resell-
ers, rarely for the oil companies who
refine or import the stuff and sell it
wholesale. In the result, the wholesale
price of petrol is still about the same
as it was ten years ago and the oil
company profits have fallen behind
the nation’s industrial average.
The oil companies have now taken
the bit and asked the pricing authori-
ties to up the wholesale price and
revise the pricing formula to take
more account of the capital they
employ. If their application succeeds,
as it probably will, motorists and
industry will still be getting practically
the cheapest petrol in the world.
Going on their recent profits, the
oil companies are having their rough-
est trot ever in Australia. Only two
of the internationals, Mobil and BP,
disclosed any profit at all for last
year. BP’s profit was about half the
previous year’s and Mobil’s somewhat
higher. All the other internationals
reported losses, comparatively small
for Total and Phillips but more than
$1 million for Amoco, Shell, and Caltex
and nearly $3 million for Esso.
Of the Australian-owned companies
Ampol made a fair but reduced profit
and cut its dividend. H. C. Sleigh
edged profit slightly higher and last
week indicated the better trend was
continuing. In some of the companies
results of activities outside marketing
petroleum products clouded the picture
but not all that much to obscure the
decline in profitability from oil sales.
The parlous state of affairs found
reflection in sharply reduced return on
capital employed. Mr. L. J. Thomp-
son, chairman of Ampol,. pointed out
at the annual meeting last week that
between 1953 and 1965 the oil
marketing companies more than
trebled their average funds employed
but the return on them shrunk from
10.6 to 2.5 percent.
By contrast, a Reserve Bank survey
of about 900 Australian public com-
panies calculated their average return
on capital employed in 1965 to be 9.5
compared with 8.5 percent four years
earlier. No wonder the oil companies
think the price-fixing formula applied
by the pricing authority is out of date.
L. J. Thompson
What hit the companies hardest last
year was the steeply reduced rate of
growth in national sales of petrol. This
had been up to 8.5 percent in 1963-
64 but it fell back to 6.1 in the follow-
ing year, down to 3.9 in 1965-66 and
in the calendar year 1966 was only
2.6 percent.
All being geared to higher growth
rates for national oil sales, most of
the companies in the over-crowded
(that is surely part of the trouble!)
industry reeled from a ,hotted-up
battle to hold their market shares.
Profit margins were inevitably victims
and their narrowing was exacerbated
by cost increases in a list of directions
mostly outside the control of the
companies.
Costs have certainly risen but, at
least in the case of the internationals,
the unidentified profits accruing to their
parent companies overseas from the
supply of crude oil to their refineries
in Australia from their foreign fields
have to be balanced against them.
These profits are never revealed. It
might strengthen the oil companies’
case in their dealings with the pricing
authorities if they were. But if, in fact,
that balance is swinging against the
internationals in their Australian
operations, head offices in London and
New York are unlikely to lift the veil.
In the meantime the Australian-
owned oil companies, Ampol and
Sleigh, who do not enjoy nearly the
same perks from importing, could
have to put up with the old pricing
formula.
It is understandable that Ampol is
foremost in the campaign to get it
revised.
J. C. HORSFALL
Unsung Hymns
“People go on purchasing Bibles, most
of which they never use.”
So says Ernest Gundry, an English-
born Western Australian minister of the
Anglican Church, who has managed
to retain the balance between a con-
servative demeanor and a radical
approach to theological and social prob-
lems.
So, last week his views were greeted
with respect, but hardly surprise, when
he roundly criticised two of his
church’s most cherished books the
Bible, and the Ancient and Modern
Hymn Book (picking out particularly
the 39 articles of religion which con-
tain the Anglican’s doctrine, as being
incomplete, intentionally ambiguous in
places, archaic in others, and reflecting
outmoded bigotries).
Of the books of the Old Testament,
11 of the 39 could go into a museum
immediately, and the other 28 needed
irrelevancies and un-Christian or anti-
Christian material eliminated before
they could become worthwhile reading.
By continuing to publish the books
of hymns, Mr. Gundry wrote in his
parish paper, the proprietors were
doing the Church a serious disservice.
Half the hymns were never sung be-
cause they were antiquated in senti-
ment, dreary in style, and tuneless in
the extreme. A good, clear, and authori-
tative statement on what the Church
accepted and taught would be useful, he
said, with the proviso that he doubted
the Anglican Church’s ability, in its
present confusion, to produce it.
Lectures Out
In some schools at Sydney’s new
Macquarie University lectures have
been all but abolished, with an almost
complete emphasis on tutorials in which
the tutor decides to give a lecture only
when he considers his students need
one.
In all schools lectures are no longer a
“set” means of transmitting views and
information. They are to be special
“occasions” for discussion of select
topics.
Swinging courses . around tutorial
series will mean a great use of roneoed
notes, documents, and “study guides.”
In the School of Historical, Philosophi-
cal, and Political Studies, Professors
Mansfield (History) and Deutscher
(Philosophy) will be distributing
“study guides” each week as the
centre of courses, complementary lec-
tures, and providing questions for
discussion and bibliographies.
Will the new system mean more pres-
sure on students? Undoubtedly. They
will find themselves reading and writing
more per week and directly supervised
by staff members. For university teach-
ers prepartory work should remain ap-
proximately the same, but the time
spent in discussion with students will
increase greatly.
The prospect of extra work seems to
have produced remarkably high morale
at Macquarie. As yet there is only one
building completed, housing the entire
staff and forcibly promoting a working
community. The plush carpets and rich
woodwork of the interior contrast with
the noise and aggression of the bull-
dozers in the red soil which surrounds
the building. Professors in shorts speak
eagerly of their plans for the Schools
and the University with uncharacteristic
elation.

PETER SAMUEL'S
VIETNAM
When Premier Ky was in Australia, he invited Bulletin
writer Peter Samuel to visit Vietnam along with
other Australian journalists. Here is Samuel’s report.
AT this time of the year the flatter
parts of the Vietnam country-
side are a green and mirrory
patchwork, as the young rice plants
grow out of ancient irrigated fields.
Villages nestle peacefully among clumps
of lush tropical trees. It all looks like
an oversize South Sea island.
Here and there a bridge is blown
up and temporarily bypassed by a
messy culvert or paddyfields are
pockmarked by bomb craters or
churned up by the weaving tracks of
armored vehicles. But there is little
sign of the miseries of war, although
the sounds of war are never far away
. . . the grumbling noise of a pass-
ing helicopter or the whistle of a
high-flying jet, in Saigon the crunch
of artillery on cool, quiet evenings, or
the deep roar of huge American trucks
rising over the crazy clatter of the
innumerable scooters and motor-bikes.
The bar girls talk of bereavement
and the burdens of rearing the kids
alone and they aren’t always just
trying to draw a buck.
That the primary weapon in wars
for hearts and minds remains the gun
is still alarmingly evident; the U.S.
Agency for International Development
cannot dispense aid without armed
guards on its gate and men to check
entering cars for bombs; Major John
Donoghue, in charge of the Aus-
tralian Army’s Civic Action Group,
was the target of sniper fire in the
village of Hao Long after months of
work here the Diggers reckon it’s
much more dangerous to drive with
him than with combat officers; the
Director of Vietnam Press has to carry
a six-shooter in the glove-box of his
car and has an especially large rear-
vision mirror to watch out for would-
be assassins on motor-bikes; the school-
teachers in Dong Loc village in a part
of Phu Yen province, recently rid of
the Cong, will not teach unless their
hamlet is patrolled by popular force
guards for fear of having their guts
torn out. Most of the very hospitable
newspaper editors of Saigon, so inter-
ested in having Australian Communist
Harry Stein along for dinner and after-
dinner-dialogue, have at times in the
past been threatened with assassina-
tion.
These efforts by the Communists to
grow power out of the barrels of their
guns have become such a huge part
of everyday life in Vietnam during the
past six years that they are almost taken
for granted, like the weather. Every
hour you spend in Vietnam the point
is glaringly obvious that non-violent
“WHAM” (the sarcastic Saigon acro-
nym for the War for Hearts and
Minds) can only be waged when the
violent are destroyed or deterred.
In Vietnam it is difficult to find
anyone who will deny that military
security is being expanded. Some will
point out that the process is slow;
Frenchmen, embittered and bored,
evade discussing the point by making
sweeping, meaningless generalisations;
many American journalists argue that
what is won on the jungle battlefield
may be lost in the villages. But no one
feels as many understandably did
two years ago that there is any
chance of military defeat.
,r pHE Viet Cong are simply unable to
mount serious offensive operations
any more. Apart from the overrunning
of a remote Special Forces camp in
March, the Communist troops gained
not one military victory in 1966. When-
ever they attempted to form up for
major operations as in Central Viet-
nam in the middle of the year, they
were broken up in spoiling operations
by Allied forces. Ambushes, once a sure
prescription for victory, are now very
hazardous for the Viet Cong because
of the remarkably accurate air and
artillery fire which friendly forces can
quickly call down. The main offensive
tactic now used is mortar harassment,
sometimes covering small squads carry-
ing satchel charges or grenades. There
is plentv of fierce and bloody fighting,
but 'h. is on the initiative of our side.
And these days it is occurring increas-
ingly in the remoter jungles which were
once inviolate sanctuaries for the Viet
Cong.
A Communist memorandum written
last year put the situation in similar
terms: “The enemy increases his troop
strength, his use of aircraft, artillery,
and toxic chemicals. He attacks us
more fiercely. Confronted by this situa-
tion, cadres and soldiers start to worry.
They worry about U.S. troop increase,
about the war becoming a protracted
conflict, about the destruction of safe
havens. Also they worry about their
food supply, about shortage of men and
equipment. They wonder if they will
receive more foreign aid so as to be
able to bring the war quickly to
victory . .
In this war of big battles the Viet
Cong will be mainly concerned with
survival, venturing out for minor
terrorist and harassment operations
from time to time, as much to maintain
morale as to disrupt the Allied effort.
Most Allied troops will still be deployed
defensively, though in this sort of war
continuous deep patrolling, and small
search-and-destroy missions are an
essential part of defence. Several
deployable divisions, however, are now
available for the more dramatic seal-
and-destroy operations against major
Viet Cong base areas, such as the Cedar
Falls operations in the Iron Triangle
area in January.
Military figures are probably the
most hazardous of statistics to fiddle
with, but a process of averaging dif-
ferent sources and trying to reconcile
them gives the following rough picture
of the Viet Cong military situation.
For about eight months now their
numerical troop strength has remained
constant around 280,000 men. They
have kept this figure up by a massive
balancing act: 70,000 annual battle
casualties and 60,000 losses through
desertion, disease, and retirement have
been almost exactly offset by infiltration
from the north (80,000) and conscrip-
tion in the south (50,000).
In Saigon I asked every official I
met: how long will it take for this
balance to be upset, given the continu-
ance of present strategies? Some, the
most sensible perhaps, refused to guess,
saying simply that, as things stand, the
war has to be slogged out and that
the figures do not mean much. The
more optimistic claimed that, from


about October last year, Viet Cong
losses exceeded new recruitment; others
said that we do not know with any
certainty what has happened since then.
All the diverse reports on which such
estimates are based are not available
for three or four months. A senior
American civilian estimated that some-
time between March and September
this year Viet Cong numbers would
clearly show a decline.
The war of big battles is therefore
one of attrition, and the speed of victory
will be determined largely by the num-
ber of troops the Allies put in.
Naturally, in Saigon there is a strong
desire for more troops: they want to
get the big fighting over more quickly.
The argument- in detail. Nguyen
Van Thieu, cha .n of the ruling
Directory and head of State, said in
an interview with the group qf Aus-
tralian journalists that he would like
to see Allied strength increased by two-
thirds. This would give a quickly
decisive superiority, whereas to hold
back troops who are available is to
“fall into the trap of the Communists,”
whose only hope is to proffer the pros-
pect of an interminable struggle and
rely on the pro-Communists and
pacifists in the West to win politically
abroad what they have failed to win
militarily on their home ground.
Regional military people see the matter
in more detailed terms.
JN Phu Yen (population 350,000),
for example, the Pi ovince Chiet,
Colonel Van Ba, could recite the
dramatic change which had occurred
during the past year with the arrival
of 4000 Korean and 3000 American
troops. Almost half the 15,000 Com-
munist troops in the province had been
killed in fierce fighting in July and
August and the remainder had been
trying to sit it out in the mountains
above the heavily populated coastal
plains, much of which they controlled
and all of which they contested in 1965.
Protected in addition by an ARVN
regiment, 2600 Vietnamese regional
troops and 3600 police field force men,
it had been possible to keep local
guerillas from soing more than fire
occasional sniper shots. The Govern-
ment has been able to re-establish its
administration and put Revolutionary
Development teams through 81 of the
province’s 251 villages.
But the threat remains because the
uncontrolled population of 75,000 har-
bors about 5000 guerilla fighters, and
in the remote areas there are another
3700 Viet Cong troops. The latter—
intelligence is surprisingly detailed—
comprise a North Vietnamese Army regi-
ment of 1200 men, another main force
local regiment, two provincial battalions,
and eight local companies. All are
under strength, but being gradually re-
built with North Vietnamese brought
from the central highlands. Equipment
comes on elephants and horses across
mountain tracks. Rice is requisitioned
from local people.
Van Ba cannot spare the troops to go
out after these remaining Communists,
and so for the time being there is a
stalemate. He estimates that with two
extra mobile brigades (6000 men) he
could quickly clear the province of
Viet Cong mainforce and permanently
neutralise the rest. Then it would be
no longer necessary to maintain such
large numbers of foreign regulars in
defensive operations on the plains.
Phuoc Tuy, much of which is the
responsibility of our Task Force, is in a
rather similar situation, though it is a
more sparsely populated province—
-120,000. Our 5000 troops are matched
against a roughly equal number of Com-
munist regulars, plus about a thousand
guerillas and regional force companies.
In the time the Task Force has been in
the province it has established un-
challenged authority for several miles
around the base area, and pushed the
big Viet Cong units well away from the
villages. Two of the three enemy units
suffered heavy casualties, especially in
the battle of Long Tan, last August, but
there is no question of a force of the
Australian size being able to tackle them
head on. The main task of our troops is
to break the hold of the thousand or so
guerillas in the villages by providing
security around them and by continu-
ously picking up Viet Cong inside the
villages by regular cordon-and-search
operations.
Our men would feel more secure if
they had the numbers to take the offen-
sive against the mainforce units in the
jungle, but as one officer put it to me:
“If the Viet Cong mainforce like to stay
out there, good luck to them. We are
concerned with the people.”
How is the non-military side of the
Vietnam war going? As even the most
hard-bitten military men in Saigon will
rush to assure you, the Vietnam war is
a combined struggle, of which fighting
is only one aspect. In a war waged
vigorously across the whole power spec-
trum from ambushes and assassinations
to the harnessing of legitimate grievances
and incitement to» racial hatred, the pro-
vision of military security is only the
first step —though a prerequisite for try-
ing the others.
It is commonplace to say that the
“other war” is not as successful for the
Allies as the big military operations.
This looks to be mainly because it is
less advanced. In 1965, priority obvi-
ously had to go to staving off imminent
military defeat of the Dien Bien Phu
type and most of the available energy of
both the Vietnamese Government and
the U.S. mission was absorbed in this.
1966 was taken up with continued
build-up and only the beginnings and
foundation laying for political, econo-
mic, and social progress.
At the national level the drafting of
a constitution is, of course, the most
notable issue, and the future depends
very much on whether the Constituent
Assembly and the ruling Directory are
able to compromise. They are at pre-
sent engaged in negotiations on two
points of difference: on the election of
province chiefs and on Parliament’s
power over the executive.
'JHE assembly proposes that all pro-
vince chiefs, like village chiefs and
city mayors, should be elected; the
Directory wants to retain for the exe-
cutive the power to appoint. Constituent
assembly men say the present system is
a means by which the central govern-
ment dispenses political patronage, and
is often a source of corruption. They
also argue that it results in unknown
men, unresponsive to popular demands
getting the job. Directory members on
the other hand, say that local represen-
tation is adequately provided for in the
elected provincial councils, and that in
time of war the centralisation of power
which appointment gives is necessary.
A likely compromise is a clause pro-
viding for the elections after eighteen
months or so, or providing for elections
only in completely secure provinces.
On the second disagreement about
the Parliament’s power over the execu-
tive all are agreed that there should
be strong government, avoiding up-
heavals. The draft constitution provides
for a Prime Minister, appointed by the
head of State, to be immune from sack-
ing for one year. After that a two-
thirds majority would be required. Since
this provides a great deal of security
of tenure, most of the concessions will
have to come from the Directory if
there is to be a compromise.
Directory members in conversation
with us certainly gave the impression
of being fully committed to the tran-
sition to representative government,
and prepared to accept its risks. That
Ky himself obviously has the wheeler-
dealer qualities required of democratic
politics provides some grounds for
optimism about a reconciliation of
differences.
The many freedoms that apply in
South Vietnam weaken the frequent
foreign accusation that the Government
is oppressive. The right to organise
trade unions exists and they are not
tamecat unions. Religious institutions
are left alone, so much so that when
we were there the police lost a Viet


Cong fugitive through accepting the
sanctity of a pagoda. There is free-
dom to organise political parties and
freedom of assembly.
The greatest transgression of liberal
principles occurs in censorship of news-
papers. Not only military news but a
good deal of general political comment
gets struck out by the censors. An
encouraging qualification to this is
that some sharp criticisms do get
through, and readers are not denied
the arguments of those in the West who
call for a withdrawal Walter
Lippman’s columns appear regularly,
and Fulbright’s observations are
reported. One such report provoked a
protest demonstration outside Ky's
office while w'e were waiting to see him
- "I was relieved to find out they
were protesting against Fulbright, not
me,” he said on meeting us. News-
papermen do agree that censorship is
not as restrictive and stupid as it used
to be, but they insist it is still applied
unnecessarily.
There are plenty of people with
criticisms of the Government, criticisms
of corruption and inefficiency, but they
are not bitterly expressed. Ky has
sacked two of the most notoriously
corrupt ministers Quang and latelv
Co and has two committees respon-
sible to him personally, designed to
carry out continuing investigations. Old
hands say that the administration of
government departments works just
perceptibly better than it used to,
though old problems often seem as
acute as ever there are not enough
middle-level officers, for example.
Government propaganda
is often inept. Take the annual
prisoner release ceremony on the 17th
parallel at the beginning of the Tet
New Year celebrations. The Depart-
ment of Information couldn't be blamed
for the bleak wet weather, but it was
not obvious that the ceremony had to be
on the top of a wdnd-sw'ept hill, that it
had to start three hours late or that
the miserable prisoners had to put up
with four speeches. The poor blighters,
kept waiting in an old shed for hours,
were dressed only in the lightest of
shirts and shorts, and the temperature
at about 40 degrees sent many of them
a horrible blue color and put their
teeth into convulsive chatters. Only the
fellows from the "liberal” TV net-
works got any satisfaction out of the
affair. Organisational bungling,
thoughtlessness, and an excessive desire
for ceremony turned an essentially
humane gesture into a painful farce.
There is also an obsession with
slogans painted on colored cloth. Not
only are they stretched across the main
streets of Saigon but they also abound
in villages. One Government official
at least expressed some scepticism:
“We’d win more friends using the
material for shirts to be given away
marked: With the compliments of your
Government.”
One of the Information Department’s
more substantive programs is, however,
producing quite spectacular results.
This is the Ghieu Hoi, or amnesty
whereby deserters from the Viet Cong
are welcomed back to the national
cause, and rehabilitated. There were
20,000 last year, or about seven per-
cent of total Viet Cong strength. In
recent months the rate has been higher
and Vietnamese officials hope to receive
up to 35,000 this year.
The reception centres are drab and
ramshackle, dusty and sunbeaten in the
dry season, muddy in the wet, with
few facilities: a loudspeaker, perhaps,
a volleyball net. Student-staff ratios
are sometimes frighteningly high; at
one centre we saw' a class of over 200
being lectured by a studious little old
man speaking into an amplifier. The
themes are simple and to the point—
realpolitik stuff about the hopelessness
of the Viet Cong cause in the face of
Western power and technology, plus
varying plays on the consistent failure
of the Communists to live up to their
promises.
It was not necessary to see the
returnees to discover one of the reasons
why they desert. Quite a distance
from the lecture room, 1 could hear
the coughing, just the first sign of
bad health. Flu, bronchitis, and
pneumonia are the least worries; a
great number have malaria and TB
as well.
They get rudimentary medical treat-
ment, and are immediately put on an
adequate diet. As well as being
lectured, they are interrogated, given
trade training, and plenty of time for
recreation. They stay between four
and six weeks, and are released with
a year's draft deferment, the equivalent
of twenty dollars cash, citizenship
papers and a job to go to or a plot
of land to clear and till.
Speaking to these fellows, the strik-
ing thing which emerges is the non-
ideological nature of their commitment.
They joined initially for adventure, or
because they happened to live in a
Viet Cong controlled area and were
drafted. On the rare occasions they
display any ideological motivations
these are negative anti-Americanism,
anti- landlordism and the rest. Some-
times they admit to having defected
because of the falseness of Communist
promises, but more often because they
are fed up wuth the life they hate
the shelling and the bombing, the con-
stant digging of tunnels and shelters,
and they get sick and hungry. Most
are from the paddies of the Mekong
Delta or the Red River plains in the
north, and so for them the jungles and
mountains they shelter and fight in
are as alien as they are for Australians
or Americans. One man said he
defected because his unit had gone for
months without any action. He couldn’t
see the sense of living like a hunted
animal.
In the final analysis, of course, it
will be the villages which decide the
fate of the war. Seventy percent of
the people live there and this is a war
for and among people. Nineteen sixty-
six saw the initiation of two new
programs for winning villages from
Communist control, and keeping them
won. The best-known is Revolutionary
Development, an intensive scheme for
discovering in detail local grievances,
and then by a combination of self-help
projects and Government aid to satisfy
them and set the village on the path
toward greater prosperity. Staying in
the village for a minimum of three
months, the 59-man teams attempt also
to speed the provision of Government
services like education, health, public
works, credit, and marketing co-opera-
tives. They are also expected to help
improve village democracy and set up
organisations for women, youth, and
old people.
the same time half the members
of the team are detailed to support
what village guards there may be in
protecting the village and the R.D.
cadres from Viet Cong coercion. So
while 20 or so of the team are around
the village doing civil work at least an
equal number have to stay in the fields
with guns slung across their shoulders,
acting as a military guard. At the
villages we visited team members were
doing a few rudimentary jobs-—clean-
ing out wells, clearing irrigation ditches,
cutting back hedges while on guard
duty. But it was clear that military
security tied them up a good deal.
The weaknesses are obvious. Three
months is too short a period in wffiich
to make any great impact over such
a wide range of activities. In theory
three months is the minimum period
the R.D. teams stay in a village, but in
practice, so I understand, it is usually
the maximum. The teams are very
popular with the people, because they
bring materials and assistance with
them, and, so, intense political pressure
is built up to disburse their blessings far
and wide. Province Chiefs, apprehen-
sive of elections, are keen to display
their benevolence to all the people,
and to prove that they can deliver
the goods. So they urge the teams to
move on quickly, and not to take
seriously the tests of success laid down
by the central ministry. As a result
the teams leave most villages far too
soon, their mission only partially com-
pleted.
Other criticisms are that' in its
effort to push the program through,
numbers of cadres have been expanded
at the expense of quality. Thirty
thousand have been put through inten-
sive 13-week training courses at Vung
Tau in little more than a year. Some
officials complain that selection pro-
cedures are inadequate. Although the
teams are said to consist of dedicated,
earnest young people, they have to
work with villagers who are mostly
women, children and old men (the
young men being in one army or the
other). In a society where the elderly
are treated with great deference this
creates all sorts of problems.
These defects can be remedied by a
more flexible, less apocalyptic approach.

In the meantime the program is doing
a good deal for the government cause,
even if it is not creating any revolution.
Goodwill is being generated among non-
committed villagers. Ham-handed
though it may often be, for the first
time there are officials who at least
attempt to give instead of being con-
cerned solely to take. Even if the R.D.
teams accomplish only a few things
they promise, this is more than the
Viet Cong have done.
At least as important as Revolution-
ary Development is the structure of
rural defence against the guerillas.
Also launched last year was the Police
Field Force. This force of policemen,
is first trained in conventional crime
detection and handling people and
then sent through a Vietnamese Can-
ungra (run by Australians) and given
confidence building, and tactical train-
ing courses to enable them to operate
as a military platoon of 40 men. By the
end of the year there will be 1500
platoons or about one to every three
villages in the country, and these will
operate in the gap between the Popular
Forces who act as hamlet garrisons and
the regular troops at the province level.
They will patrol between the villages
by day and lay ambushes by night.
Their police character will enable them
to collect intelligence on the Viet Cong
guerilla infrastructure and their powers
of entry and arrest will enable them to
act against the political cadres as well
as against the guerilla with a gun.
LYING behind all these diverse acti-
vities, there is now a logical
administrative structure. The Vietnam-
ese Government machinery now has a
certain sense to it for example, all
activities relating to rural development
are now run by junior ministers, who
in turn are responsible to the Minister
for Revolutionary Development. More
important, perhaps, the Americans
have organised their aid and advisory
operations to tie in with the Vietnamese
organisation. A new Office of Civilian
Operations oversees all the U.S. efforts
to assist Revolutionary Development,
while the huge U.S. aid program con-
centrates on general commodity support
and longer term projects.
0.C.0. works, according to officials
who have no drums to beat. We saw
the relatively smooth way in which
refugees from the Iron Triangle Opera-
tion were catered for, a smoothness
attributed by those involved to better
organisation on both the Vietnamese
American side.
Finally, it is necessary to report a
general feeling about the war in Viet-
nam itself. Members of the foreign
Press corps apart, there is a surprising
optimism for the future, a belief that
the worst is past. Life goes on regard-
less of the horrible volume of personal
trials and tragedies which the war
brings daily. Occasionally the question
arises: how long will it take to win
the peace? But it is taken for granted
that it will be won.
That, I am told, is a new atmosphere.


OVERSEAS
The Chinese Guessing Game
Explaining China has become an international industry, selling a slippery product
Rumor scooped up by diligent and sometimes highly inventive reporters
inside or outside China’s borders. In this Endgame of “anyone’s guess is as good
as another’s,” we offer our own analysis
" Watchers "
wispy beginnings of the Great
Cultural Revolution were noted
early in 1966 by the traditional “China
watchers”—distant academics and Hong
Kong-based journalists who interviewed
refugees from Red China.
Then came Chairman Mao’s “great
swim,” some nine miles across the Yang-
tze River at age 72, an event which
shook credulity; the sudden explosion
of Red Guards; and a swim-by of 5000
Chinese at Wuhan, reviewed by Mao
and reported by the Peking New China
News Agency, and only now denounced
as a hoax (denounced on a wall poster
in Peking) by a Tao Chu, now in dis-
grace but then a Politburo member.
The “China watchers” began to lose
the game as opposition to Mao firmed,
conflicting broadcasts emanated from
various cities, newspapers were closed,
refugees from different parts of China
had differing stories to tell, and the Red
Guards began to convey news by wall
posters which their enemies tore down
and replaced, and which the Red
Guards tore down again, etc.
As China looked to other Communist
countries for approval, while denounc-
ing Russia, the European Communist
news agencies joined in to give their
versions of events inside China, and
these versions were in turn monitored
and passed on.
All of the “China watchers’ ” exper-
tise, applied in the traditional way and
using the traditional sources of experts
denied passport entry to the “watched”
country, began to fail them.
Pressure began to drive the “watch-
ers” to predictions rather than assess-
ments, possibly concluding with one
desperate throw in a February dispatch
from Hong Kong, in which a recog-
nised China expert said with certainty
that Mao was losing and would lose.
He had not noticed the admission of
defeat by the Australian “China
watcher,” Professor C. P. Fitzgerald,
who said a few weeks earlier, “The
Red Guards . . . have taught the ex-
perts humility. The self confidence and
assurance of informed interpretation
have been replaced by a rueful aware-
ness that all is speculation . .
In fact, by Christmas, 1966, specu-
lation had become the stock in trade
of the Western experts, possibly on the
theory that a long-term guess is better
than a soon-disproved “fact.” To quote
only one of many instances, when Mao’s
wife, Chiang Ching, suddenly appeared
as a Red Guard leader, it led one
expert to extend a theory that Lin Piao,
Mao’s new heir, might really be front-
ing for someone for example, Chiang
Ching.
As the Red Guards had denounced
almost all other leaders as “revisionist”
it seemed as tenable a theory as any
other.
Another symptom of the “watchers’ ”
confusion—delayed news —was observ-
able soon after last Christmas, when
AAP-Reuter reported that a huge
Red Guards rally had denounced Presi-
dent Liu Shao-Chi and secretary-
general Teng Hsiao-ping. Later, posters
both announced and denied their
arrests. On February 7 the London
“Times” pictured Liu as “dismissed . . .
according to the Japanese newspaper
‘Yomiuri Shimbun’.” Two weeks later
local newspapers carried reports from
Tokyo that Liu and Teng had been
dismissed in August, at a Central Com-
mittee meeting. The Japanese had not
only taken over from the “watchers”
but were practising one-upmanship on
them.
Readers
rpHE Japanese intervention followed
naturally when reading the daily
Peking posters became the essence of
the game. Japanese journalists and busi-
ness men were able to move freely in
and out of China. They could read the
posters at a glance. Their reports be-
came the main source of China news,
especially after the events of January 9,
when the headlines read, “1000 Victims
as Riots Rack China.”
Red Guard posters were quoted as
saying fighting was centred in Nanking
and involved 60,000 people. Czech
journalists in Peking said they read that
captives had had fingers, noses, ears,
and tongues cut off. Japanese journalists
read that girl prisoners had had their
clothes ripped off, and also reported a
Red Guard split.
Another Japanese reporter linked the
fingers, noses, and clothes events. A
Canadian competitor, who also reads
posters, noticed they condemned Liu,
Teng, and that wily old propagandist
Tao Chu, said to have been behind a
Canton revolt (as well as slandering
Swimmer Mao).
Tokyo also sent out a report that
100,000 Red Guards had stormed
through Peking after Liu’s blood. This
report was the first to place the events
at Nanking as “last week.”
Still on the same day, Tokyo
reported clashes at Nanking the week
before (40 dead, 500 wounded, 6000
arrested). Next day Japanese in Peking
said it had been 6000 Red Guards.
Those “watchers,” now at desperation
point, listened to Peking Radio’s daily
routine quotation from Mao’s “thought”
“when we die for the people it is a
worthy death” and made a dispatch
of that.
From then on the “poster” people
were dominant.
They noticed Army posters stating that
former Chief of the General Staff, Lo
Jui-ching, and a deputy premier, Po
I-po, had suicided (Lo only broke a
leg) and that Teng had tried to; Mao
posters suggesting compromise in the
leadership struggle; Lin Piao posters
saying that China was in “total civil
war” (other poster readers interpreted
it differently as “total internal battle,”
and argued what that meant).
The Japanese poster watchers also
gave us news of Mao’s instruction to
the Liberation Army to help him; news
that the Army had routed a 20,000-
strong anti-Mao force in Sinkiang
province, near the Russian border; of
the Army takeover of Peking’s security
and of a Soviet-Chinese clash at
the Manchurian borders. How this news
from far flung places got on to Peking
wall posters, or how reliable or other-
wise it might be was never mentioned
during that heyday of the Tokyo report.

Consensus
JN our analysis, the inevitable open
clashes between China Communism
and Russian Communism cut short the
“poster watchers’ ” triumph. Last
month, Russian agencies, newspapers,
and radio began to give out their ver-
sion of what was happening in China.
Soon reports datelined Tokyo custom-
arily included such statements as
“Radio Moscow said . . .”
On February 20, for example, the
Russians not only scored inclusion of
their viewpoint in an AAP-Tokyo re-
port, but also put out a shrewd piece
of mocking propaganda which made
headlines as “Chinese ‘Happy Fami-
lies’,” and “Love in China.”
A Russian weekly magazine, quoted
by Radio Moscow, had said that the
Chinese newspapers were telling people
that love was a petty bourgoise super-
stition, and warning families not to
settle quarrels by peaceful co-existence,
because that was revisionist.
Whereas the area of fighting in China
had been reported from the posters,
Radio Moscow began to send out
results of its own, possibly from
selective monitoring of Chinese broad-
casts, but with the self-interest evident
when they went, “Mr. Ulanfu, a fre-
quent target of pro-Mao criticism, is
said to have raised the slogan ‘Mongolia
for the Mongolians.’ ”
The Soviet reports added to the
standard confusion outside China, and
sent the news gatherers hustling else-
where to interview the Dalai Lama
in New Delhi, for instance, when a
rising in Tibet was supposedly men-
tioned by Radio Lhasa and to Taipei
to see whether the generally ignored
Nationalists had anything to add.
They rose to the occasion with area
reports which only confirmed what
Peking Radio had been admitting, dis-
asters here and there, used as exhor-
tations to all to be on guard against
the revisionists, and fight.
Radio Peking also hit back at the
Russians, by quoting Foreign Minister
Chen Yi that “the Soviet has brought
relations between Moscow and Peking
to the verge of rupture.”
As yet, no one-i in the West has
thought of leading the daily dispatch
with, “A consensus of world news ser-
vices opinions today is that . . .”
This might be the only sporting way
to handle the whole affair.


The D.L.P.
WHAT
NEXT?
IN politics imitation is the most
deadly form of flattery. If another
party successfully takes over your
policy, what have you got left?
This is the question THE BULLE-
TIN put last week to four leaders of
the DLP, Senator McManus, Federal
Secretary Kane, Federal President
Joshua, and Queensland State Secretary
Judge.
The reasons for asking the question
were: on the one hand party leaders
are confident about the DLP’s growth,
producing evidence such as the sizable
increase in the DLP vote in Western
Australia and New South Wales, public
and private acknowledgement of the
excellence of its propaganda campaigns,
rapid inflow of youth into the
-Party (particularly in Queensland), the
..continued vitality of the Party in Vic-
toria, the'move to-.administrative offices
in N.S.W. four times a&vlarge as those
at present, the position of power the
DLP Senators have discovered in the
Senate and, of course, on the other
side, the increasing deterioration of the
ALP in electoral contests.
However, the lasi election threw up
one very big problem for the DLP: now
that the Liberals have taken up State
Aid and become apostles of “all-the-
way” in South-East Asia, how does
the DLP distinguish itself from the
Liberals on issues that matter?
For the twelve years of its existence
the DLP has been publicly identified
as the Party that is most aggressively
anti-Communist in its foreign and
domestic policies and that advocates the
“sectarian” policy of State Aid for
church schools.
The 1966 Federal Election, however,
saw the Government campaign on a
program almost indistinguishable in its
broad public outlines from DLP state-
ments for years back. The realpolitick
heritage of the Menzies 'era has left-
State aid as a permanent component of
Liberal education policy. The accession
of Harold Holt has transformed Liberal
foreign policy into an Asian-orientated,
militarily committed, American-based,
anti-Communist mould.
In addition, the 1966 image and
style of the Liberals has brought them
closer to the DLP a quick survey
of last election Liberal advertisements
with those of the DLP, say, three years
ago, reveals almost identical themes
and images: the prophecies of doom,
the suggestions of ALP anti-American-
ism and irresponsibility, the emphasis
on undifferentiated hordes of Asian
Reds.
Faced with a situation in which the
DLP has lost its distinctive patterns of
policy and style to the Liberals, when
we interviewed them last week the
DLP leaders jumped in different direc-
tions.
Kane responded with a sort of happy
pride that his Party had become a
“policy pacemaker” for the Govern-
ment of the day. McManus claimed
that there were, in fact, great differ-
ences between the policies of the two
Parties, and especially in the area of
foreign affairs, and went on to list
eight or nine distinctively DLP propos-
als. Joshua almost despaired, stating
Senator V. C. Gair
that “at times we have been forced into
narrow channels as when the Liberal-
Country Party Coalition adopted our
Defence Policy. We cannot expect to
take votes away from them.”
Kane’s claim that the DLP has had
these policies adopted by the Liberals
is neither a guarantee that they will act
similarly in future,nor that these
policies will always be realistic. (The
role of prophet is a risky one in demo-
cratic politics.) Similarly, McManus is
probably accurate in his estimate of the
policy differences between the two
Parties, yet the question facing these
leaders is not whether there are such
differences for them, but, how to con-
vince voters that they exist, and that
DLP proposals are more attractive and
relevant than the policies of the Lib-
erals.
This new problem of a lack of pro-
duct differentiation possibly provides
another crisis for the DLP: if the Gov-
ernment has now taken over a policy
that the DLP’s largely Catholic base
has supported time and again, is the
DLP in danger of losing this base?
When faced with this question, Kane
replied to the effect that the DLP did
not have a “Catholic base” but an
“anti-Communist one”; McManus ad-
mitted the existence of this religious
base, quickly adding that “the DLP
will fight for recognition as a party for
all creeds and classes”; Joshua backed
McManus’ thoughts and Judge pointed
to the widespread Catholic hierarchical
opposition to the DLP.
Kane, I think, gave the most effective
reply. He said that the discipline of
DLP preferences and the stability of
the Party’s vote showed that the DLP
voter was unusually intelligent and
aware and that he thus would be
capable of perceiving the various
distinctive facets of DLP policy.
Kane’s estimate of the DLP voter is
supported by most academic students of
the DLP’s performance, with the quali-
fication that, due to the DLP’s conscious
search for the top spot on the ballot
ticket, its vote also contains a high
amount of “donkey” votes. It is also
true that, if Kane’s argument is valid,
the DLP may be able only to maintain,
not expand, its present electoral base.
There are, however, alternatives for
DLP supporters. They can now support
the Liberals, either because of ignorance
of any basic policy difference with the
DLP (the Liberals being preferable be-
cause they can implement theirs), or
because they recognise these differences
but feel these are insufficient to main-
tain them as DLP voters.
It is possible to forecast shifts of this
sort by analysing the fundamental
reasons why the Catholics, who form the
great proportion of DLP support, vote
as they do.
If DLP Catholics have in the past
felt that (1) good Catholics support
anti-Communism and State Aid, or
(2) good Catholics support their
“Church Party,” or simply (3) they
should support anti-Communism and
State Aid for non-religious reasons,
then there is little reason for them to
vote DLP any longer. With the loss
of the late Archbishop Mannix, the
decreasing number of pro-DLP clerical
outbursts and the positive indifference
of the recent Vatican Council to the
idea of a “Catholic interest” in party


Status quo
or new-look?
By PETER MANNING
Senator F. McManus
politics, the notion that the DLP is a
party for Catholics is rapidly disinte-
grating (if it has not already). Equally,
the bi-partisan acceptance of State Aid
at the Federal level, and the Liberals 5
adoption of their new foreign policy,
makes the old Catholic-DLP relation-
ship for the first and third reasons
unnecessary. On these grounds, the
Liberal Government would thus pro-
vide a new home for such a Catholic
vote.
If, on the other hand, these Catholics
have voted DLP believing that the
“natural” resting place for their vote is
with a Labor Party and that the DLP
provides the means whereby a Labor
Party of their preference will be
created (either by reform of the ALP
or establishment of a new one via the
DLP), then there would seem every
reason for them to continue to vote for
the DLP as they always have. What
the DLP does, not its policies, is essen-
tial here.
From what is known from surveys,
it looks as if the DLP voting base is
mostly and increasingly made up of
middle-class Catholics, particularly
young marrieds. This suggests that the
idea of the Labor Party as the really
“natural” Party for Catholics may have
lost its influence. Again, the member-
ship inflow of the DLP is overwhelm-
ingly from this under-40 group (despite
the predominance of the 1955 “split”
generation in its upper echelons).
Piecing the information together
shows that DLP support, including its
vote, probably comes largely from
young, middle-class Catholics. These
people are issue-conscious and politi-
cally aware. They may have little
reason not to vote Liberal in future.
If this is true there are a few courses
open for the DLP. They are:
1. These new-breed Catholics might
decide that, though the Liberal Gov-
ernment pushes, and could implement,
the twin DLP lines of anti-Communism
and State Aid, the DLP’s proposals are
still preferable. This would mean that
they were unusually perceptive in that
they go beyond the broad outlines of
policy and delve into more specific
aspects of party policies. This possibility
J. T. Kane
would require no change of strategy on
the part of the DLP.
£. The DLP could conclude that, its
general approaches having been adopted
by the Government, there is either no
use or no reason for it to prod the
Government further. Thus it could
emphasise solely its role as a Party
designed to reform the ALP, and for-
sake completely that of “policy pace-
maker” for the Government. This
approach would rely on the second,
minority type of DLP supporter - the
old ALP Catholics who have voted DLP
since the 1955 split. That seems impos-
sible for two reasons: firstly, it might
be electorally disastrous; and secondly,
it might alienate the younger generation
within the Party, a group that the DLP
cannot afford to lose.
3. The DLP could change its political
base and image. Catholics, especially
after Vatican 11, are no longer pre-
Conservatives with
streaks of idealism
dictable actors. Since its vote and
membership are shifting in this direction
anyway (although under a religious
cover), the young, urban, middle-class
grouping seems the base for the DLP
to seek. Such a course would involve
cultivating the same garden the Lib-
erals have been working for years,
though it is so huge that this fact
would be unimportant.
A further concern for “image,” an
incorporation of its young blood into
the upper reaches of the DLP power
structure, a smartening-up of relations
with the Press, a more extensive use
of television campaigning, and a con-
tinuing concern for selling policy pro-
ducts distinguishable from the Liberal
and the ALP a combination of these
tactics could well stabilise the DLP
within a more normal and predictable
class rather than on a religious base.
In addition, possibilities of vote ex-
pansion would present themselves under
such a plan, with this expansion being
the plum gained for the risks taken in
undertaking a task of these proportions.
This undertaking, also, would be a
strengthening of present trends for the
DLP, not an artificial gymnastic of
electoral relationships between the
Party and its support.
Of the above three, Party leaders
at present would be far more likely
to opt for the first possibility. Tempera-
mentally, they are conservatives with
streaks of idealism. Having taken the
really, big risk in bolting from the ALP
in 1955, there may be little heart for
courses as radical as turning the DLP
into a broad-based party. Similarly,
they are children of their generation
and have little stomach for status-
conscious “middle-class.”
Senator McManus admits that the
second alternative is false. This in
effect means that the choice for the
DLP leadership in meeting the Liberal
challenge of stealth is restricted to a
passive reliance on the intelligence and
preferences of the present DLP voter
versus a conscious move in the direction
of a non-religious base. So far as votes
are concerned, the choice is more stark:
it is between a DLP vote with an in-
built ceiling of around ten percent of
the total, versus one limited only by
its ability to compete with the other
parties for its new base. In the latter
case the DLP as an alternative Gov-
ernment would be a practical pos-
sibility.
These are very general consider-
ations. Yet the dilemma the Party faces
is itself very general: overall policy
lines and long-term voting patterns are
the elements of the puzzle. There are
moments when matters of purpose,
direction, capability, and performance
must be considered by any political
organisation.
The “future of the DLP” is a topic
that can go on and on. It is also
one which men like Kane, Gair,, and
McManus have heard discussed many
times. They laugh at the prospect of
the demise of the DLP it has been
assumed and predicted so often, and
the signs of immediate vitality are so
strong, one cannot blame them. At
present, however, they freely acknowl-
edge that there is a problem in clearly
establishing a unique identity for the
DLP. The question is whether they
see the depth of its implications and
the shape it might form. On these in-
sights will depend their choice of the
strategic possibilities for the DLP in
the near future.


The End of the Age of Moses?
When a bit of give and take is not enough
AUSTRALIA in the past year or so
moved out of the Age of Menzies;
in the past two or three months
cultural Australia has been abruptly
jolted out of the Age of Moses. Whether
the N.S.W. Minister for Public Works,
Mr. Davis Hughes, recommends con-
certs only for the Major Hall, giving
the ABC its victory, or a multi-purpose
hall, which the Elizabethan and the
Opera House Committee want, the cosy
set-up of interlocking committees will
never be the same again.
Sir Charles Moses (it is two years
since he retired as general manager of
the ABC) is not a central figure in the
dispute, but he is one of the most inter-
esting. It was he who succeeded at the
final moment in persuading the Minister
to call this week’s conference of the
parties. “The problem can be sorted
out by a little give and take at a
round-table conference,” said Sir
Charles blandly. That is the Moses
view, hardened by a lifetime of seeing
the old-boy network, the glass of some-
thing in the boardroom, the private
phone call late at night, work perfectly.
But Australia, as has been said and
shown on numerous occasions, cannot
go on being a simple society for ever,
and Sir Charles may find that here a
bit of give and take is not enough.
Even some of those close to the
struggle are surprised that the battle
for the Major Hall has become so much
a power game. There is no doubt that
the Elizabethan-Opera House group
want a multi-purpose hall and no doubt
that the ABC believes it should be con-
certs only. But it is entirely clear that
some of the people involved simply
want to win.
One rather fascinating smaller point
is the vanishing “spokesman.” Both the
Chairman of the ABC, Dr. Darling, and
the General Manager, Mr. Duckman-
ton, have made statements under their
own names, and their published views
do not entirely tally. The Chairman of
the Elizabethan, Dr. Coombs, tickered
his statement back from London to add
to that of the Elizabethan’s Executive
Director, Mr. Stefan Haag. Finally, the
Chairman of the Opera House Com-
mittee, Mr. Haviland, broke his vow of
silence.
Sir Charles may not be a central
figure but he remains the only person
with a finger in three pies. He still
has some influence in certain reaches
of the ABC, and concerts were practic-
ally his creation. He, with Mr. Haviland
and Professor Ashworth, is a surviving
original member of the Opera House
Committee. He is also a member of
the Elizabethan.
QNLY Mr. Neil Hutchison had a simi-
lar spread of interest. Mr. Hutchi-
son is ABC Controller of Programs, a
member of the Elizabethan Trust
Board, but last week resigned from the
Opera House Committee so that he
would be freer to follow the ABC’s
Opera House line.
Mr. Hutchison remains on the Eliza-
bethan Trust Board, along with Dr.
Darling and Mr. Duckmanton.
Rightly, one would think, these ABC
people believe that the Elizabethan is
not'concerned only with opera in Syd-
ney as the Elizabethan itself seems
at the moment to believe so there
is no illogicality in their remaining with
this organisation.
As has been made abundantly clear,
the controversy over the Major Hall
caught both the ABC and the Eliza-
bethan unprepared. Mr. Hutchison was
the only ABC staff member on the
Opera House Trust and his concern
is not primarily music, except when
broadcast, or concerts. Because appoint-
ments are made of people and not of
people representing organisations, the
Opera House Trust has Sir Charles
Moses and Sir Bernard Heinze, now
both ex-ABC.
The links between the Elizabethan
and the Opera House Committee are
much stronger. They have in common
Mr. Haviland, Dr. Lloyd Ross, of the
Australian Railways Union, Sir Charles
Moses, and Mr. Haag.
The last major manoeuvre of the
old-boy network was to get the Syd-
ney Symphony Orchestra, during its
Commonwealth Festival tour in 1965,
into the pit for performances of the
Australian Ballet Company. Any time
the ABC and the Elizabethan are in
dispute about the use of the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra, the Musicians’
Union is quite capable of applying the
crunch.
There are some people in the ABC
who think the Commission should get
out of concerts and stick to radio and
•television, its primary jobs. The present
general manager, Mr. Duckmanton,
may not be one of these, but he has
not had the direct concern with con-
certs which his predecessor had. The
concert department, in Sydney at least,
had its peak prestige within the Com-
mission when Sir Charles was general
manager, and Mr. Charles Buttrose,
who was sent to New York soon after
Sir Charles retired, combined Federal
publicity and concerts as one job. It
is probable that Mr. Duckmanton had
to do a great deal of swotting to under-
stand in any detail what the ABC
should be doing in the Major Hall.
But the ABC, although it had lost
eight years’ battles, had little trouble

in putting itself in a position where it
could win the W'ar. Once it woke up,
it moved ahead like a well-mannered
juggernaut. Problems connected with
the presentation of orchestral concerts
in the Main Hall have been reticulating
from the Commission through the top
management down to the lower ranks,
and from the lower ranks through
management to the Commission.
Mr. Warwick Mehaffey, whose
recommendations on acoustics have
been the subject of top-level discussions,
is, in ABC terms, Assistant Supervisor
Buildings Planning (Engineering). If
the whole of the Commission and the
top management fell in the battle for
the Main Hall, a hundred other ABC
employees could come forward and go
on talking confidently about reverbera-
tion times and seating arrangements.
If the ABC was caught unprepared,
the chairman of the Elizabethan, Dr.
Coombs, has entered the battle as
Napoleon without an army. As has
been entirely clear at other times, the
Elizabethan is Dr. Coombs and Dr.
Coombs is the Elizabethan. The presi-
dent of the Trust Board, Sir lan Pot-
ter, is a man of influence and energy,
but his role has tended to be the tradi-
tional one of holding up the Melbourne
end of a Sydney-based national body.
The Elizabethan board always has
two representatives from each State,
but the influence of these people, except
in their own bailiwick, is negligible.
The Trust Board meets once a month
in Sydney or Melbourne and most meet-
ings are attended by only N.S.W. and
Victorian members.
pROBABLY the only member of the
Trust Board with a great deal of
influence is Mr. Hutchison. This would
date back to his term as Executive
Director of the Trust, on loan from
the ABC, but would undoubtedly be
diminishing. Dr. Coombs is inclined to
forget about Mr. Haag.
However, Dr. Coombs and force of
circumstances seem to have left the
Elizabethan in an impoverished state.
The staff at the moment is stripped
to the bone, that is, it retains a fairly
large administrative staff, but has prac-
tically no public relations or technical
staff.
Dr. Coombs unwittingly placed the
Elizabethan in a weaker position by
suggesting nine months ago to the
Commonwealth Government that most
of the functions of the Trust be taken
over by a Performing Arts Council.
This council does not yet exist, but the
Elizabethan has almost ceased to exist.
The battle for the Major Hall, messy
and all as it is, is only a beginning,
although one which has made it clear
that the interests and needs of the
various branches of the arts run
counter, not parallel. Linked with the
current struggle is the Elizabethan’s
efforts to get its own orchestra. By the
time these two matters are resolved,
it should be entirely clear that the
rift in the lute is permanent.

Sweetness and Light
NO MATTER how strongly Professor
John Yudkin, of London, feels about
sugar intake being responsible for the
prevalence of heart disease in developed
countries, one would hardly expect in
this day and age that he would go
forth preaching his gospel without
sponsorship. His trip to Australia was
underwritten by the Dairy Produce
Board and the Dairy Industry Council.
Food manufacturers Holderness
Foods Pty. Ltd. has a minor share in
the project. Holderness probably do
not care particularly whether you
spread butter or margarine on their
Enervite crispbread.
Professor Yudkin’s food theories,
which probably should not be over-
simplified, include a belief that sugar
is bad in itself, but is doubly dangerous
because its addition makes other carbo-
hydrates so palatable that we eat more
of them than we should. On butter and
heart disease, he believes increased con-
sumption of animal fats and increased
heart disease in modern times are
merely two events occurring together,
not cause and effect. .
His visit must have cheered up the
dairy people no end, particularly as
Daisy has so far proved far less beguil-
ing than Mrs. Jones. But out at Mar-
rickville Margarine, the old cam-
paigners were not too worried about
Professor Yudkin. They prefer to rely
on the view of the National Heart
Foundation report that polyunsaturated
fats do lower blood chloresterol levels.
“We have never claimed our margarine
could cure or stop heart trouble, but
it is a way of reducing blood chlores-
terol levels,” said the firm’s managing
director, R. C. Crebbin.
Over at CSR, they admitted they
had a “nice thick file” on Professor
Yudkin and his statements. “He can’t
prove a thing and neither can we,”
was their last word on the subject.
Art for Export
THE MERTZ COLLECTION of Aus-
tralian paintings will be shown in the
Corcoran Gallery, Washington,
U.S.A., on March 10. The collection of
145 pictures by 77 painters was
acquired by American publisher Harold
Mertz during visits to Australia a
couple of years ago. Buying was
through Kym Bonython, of Adelaide,
who is flying to Washington for the
opening.
After the Washington exhibition, the
collection will tour the United States.
With it will go a film made by Geoff
and Dahl Collings for Qantas. The
film, running time 27 minutes, shows
the paintings, but the commentary fills
in details of the artist and his back-
ground.

A FEW DAYS AGO Peter Watkin’s
documentary “The War Game” was
shown to a small group of Sydney
people with close interests in TV and
films. Naturally this didn’t mean us,
but we managed to see it with sorqe
of the other proles at a WEA Film
Study Group screening.
The storm of controversy aroused by
the BBC’s refusal to show the film on
television has clouded the issue—any
breath of criticism now and you’re
immediately assumed to be on the side
of censorship. But the fact is that we
didn’t find it as scarifying an exper-
ience as such a film should be. The
subject is desperately important, the
film is cleverly made; but “The War
Game” didn’t seem as shocking at the
time of viewing or as memorable in
retrospect as “Fires On The Plain,”
“Night And Fog,” “Dr. Strangelove”
or Watkins’ own earlier TV documen-
tary “Culloden.”
Watkins again uses the newsreel-
documentary technique to show how
the game of power politics leads in-
evitably to the use of nuclear weapons
and the devastation of non-military tar-
gets, exemplified by a quiet town in
Kent. (Incidentally, the victims of
frightful burns all keep their hair
intact—a curious lapse on the part
of Watkins, who has devoted much
care to the make-up.)
But for all its shock value, the film
left an uneasy feeling that we were
being got at. Starting with the premise
that “this could happen,” Watkins
leads his audience imperceptibly to
feel “this will happen,” and by the
end we’re practically being presented
with a fait accompli. He dwells pes-
simistically on the inevitability of it all
—it is coming and nobody can do
anything about it; shelters are too ex-
pensive for the average person and no
use anyway; politicians can’t be made
to care who gets killed. Watkins’ atti-
tude is about as helpfully constructive
as those men who carry banners saying
“The day of doom is at hand.”
Having sounded his warning knell,
Mr. Watkins has apparently decided
to let us go to hell in our own way.
He is currently engaged in directing a
feature ~film starring Miss Jean
Shrimpton.
Finding Out
LOOKING as abstracted as his paint-
ings young William Wright (29) was
in the throes of hanging 65 represent-
ative works at Rudy Komon’s Gallery
last week, while trying not to worry
about his actress-wife, Meg Wynn
Owen, who was seriously ill in hospital
with a thrombosis precipitated by a
slight accident in London. In between
taping the edges of pictures and leaping
about deciding where they might look
best, he talked about his profitable and
successful eight years in London.
Wright went overseas before the ink
was dry on his diploma from East Syd-
ney Technical College. In fact, he
didn’t wait to pick the diploma up. He
went straight to Florence where he
continued to study, then on to Rome
for six months, stayed for a little while
in Paris, and finally made the perma-
nent move to London.
He has supported himself all the way
on the private sale of paintings, a
phenomenal achievement for so young
an artist. Not for him the entrepreneur
and the monthly cheque. He had to
make it in order to eat. Except for
a “bit of a struggle” in Italy, Wright
has been steadily successful. Until last
year he had not held an exhibiton.
Why was it necessary for someone
who has become successful financially
and has received critical acclaim in
London to return to Australia?

A devotee of color, Wright cannot
understand why so many artists seem
to be afraid of it. Some of his most
recent paintings are involved with only
one color though there appear to be
more. He has his studio in his London
flat and creates his abstracts directly
on to canvas. “I resolve the picture as
I go along, using the color idea on a
symmetric basis. I detest the thought
that my paintings may be regarded as
merely decorative.”
Working to Plan
VISITING INDIAN Mr. Patwan
Singh is both architect and political
writer; a fairly unusual combination,
one would think, but quite logical in
the light of Mr. Singh’s theories. Gov-
ernments are there and you cannot
ignore them, Mr. Singh points out, so
architects should secure their own niche
in politics if they want to change the
physical environment.
Mr. Singh, the editor of Indian
“Design,” has just had his first book,
“India and the Future of Asia,” pub-
lished by Faber and Faber. He has
been brought to Australia by the De-
partment of External Affairs.
“Take a plan for urban renewal,”
Mr. Singh said. “It involves all sorts
of expressions of taste by architects,
designers, and so on, but before you
begin, real estate, money, and business
come in, and these are controlled by
politics. The public is indifferent to
. the physical environment, but if
architects were politically more in-
fluential, the public might take them
more seriously. Architecture courses
include history, aesthetics, sociology,
why not politics? It’s just as important,
isn’t it?”
Mr. Singh agreed that in his country
the caste system and the ruling classes
(“our in-group makes the British
Establishment look open-ended”) could
be an impediment to necessary change.
“But what is overlooked is that we
are quite able administrators and
technologists,” he said.
One direction in which he would
like to see rapid technical change is
in the handling of foodstuffs. “The
great bulk of Indian wheat is grown
at home,” he said. “Of the 90 to 95-
million tons of grain eaten each year,
nine to 11 million tons are imported,
but each year about 20 million tons
is eaten by pests. Instead of importing
grain and giving the exporters the
thrill of benevolence, we should estab-
lish a Ministry of Pest Control to see
that all that food is not wasted.”
Tanner's Week
“That's not the way we taught you to do
it at the Police Boys' Club karate class."
"We can't have you contaminating our Australian flies.”
“In view of the cuts in research grants, you'd
better get rid of that anti-Government propaganda."

ON THE MARGIN
Inside the Pyramid
ANYONE who studies the construc-
tion of the Great Pyramid of
Cheops will find it easier to
understand the troubles that have beset
the Sydney Opera House. The two
buildings have a number of character-
istics in common. Both are big and
expensive. Both took a long time to put
up (20 years in the case of the Pyra-
mid, which bulk for bulk was much
the quicker job). And both were
designed primarily with an eye to the
impressiveness of the outside rather than
the accommodation within. Because of
the latter fact the architect of the
Pyramid, like his counterpart at the
Opera House, ran into difficulties.
To quote A Dictionary of Egyptian
Civilisation, edited by Georges Posener
(Methuen, 1962): “Structural evidence
suggests that the interior plan of the
Great Pyramid was altered twice in
the course of its construction.” The
function of the Pyramid was to provide
a tomb for the client, King Cheops.
At first a smallish burial chamber was
excavated underneath the structure.
Then this was abandoned and a larger
one was built inside the Pyramid.
Finally a third, much larger burial
chamber was built above the second
one. Here the body df Cheops was
eventually placed.
Until now Egyptologists were in
doubt as to what happened on the plan-
ning level when these changes in the
Pyramid were made. But I am glad
to say that some research of mine has
thrown light on the question.
A SERIES of conferences were held
between King Cheops’ vizier, Davis-
hooz, and the architect of the Great
Pyramid, the gifted and temperamental
Yernu-Tson. Under pressure Yernu-
Tson agreed to abandon the first inade-
quate burial chamber and build a
second one. But things came to a
crisis when Davishooz a forceful ad-
ministrator complained that the
second burial chamber was too small,
and demanded a bigger one still.
Davishooz said to the architect:
“We’re worried about the rising costs
of the job. If it weren’t for the Pyramid
Lotteries, we’d never be able to meet
the bills you are sending in. But our
main objection is the interior planning.
You’re building this b great
Pyramid, yet you still haven’t provided
suitable mummy accommodation. It’s
not good enough, Yernu-Tson.”
Yernu-Tson, speaking with much
feeling, replied: “Davishooz, you seem
to have no understanding of the experi-
mental nature of this Pyramid. It is
costing a lot because I refuse to
build a second-rate one. To make
the changes you want, I would have
to compromise my whole conception of
what the Great Pyramid should be. If
you insist, I must hand in my
resignation.”
Yernu-Tson resigned. Protesting
students marched round the Pyramid
with banners inscribed: “Yernu-Tson
In Charge,” but Davishooz stood firm.
He gave the job of finishing the
Pyramid to an obliging young archi-
tect who satisfied the client’s require-
ments with regard to mummy
accommodation.
Cynical Egyptians said: “It doesn’t
matter what’s inside the Great Pyra-
mid, anyway. It’s going to be a hell
of a big tourist attraction.” And this,
indeed, proved to be the case.
In one respect the interior altera-
tions to the Pyramid were less serious
than those that are proposed for the
Opera House. They did not involve
any change in the building’s name.
It is now likely that the Opera House
will be, in fact, a concert hall, plus
a minor hall where operas may be put
on occasionally as a sideline. In that
case the question will arise whether
in honesty one can go on calling it an
Opera House.
If after all these years the name is
changed to the Centre for Performing
Arts, or something like that, it will
be a painful shock for Sydney. It will
be like telling the Egyptians to start
calling the Pyramids the Cheops
Memorial Centre, or Englishmen to
refer to Stonehenge as the Salisbury
Plain Festival Site.
Yet I believe that in the long run
Sydney will feel relieved if the name
is changed. It will no longer face the
responsibility of living up to an Opera
House. Australians have never shown
much evidence of a spontaneous en-
thusiasm for opera. In expectation of
having an Opera House, some of our
composers are said to be writing operas
of a national character La Morte
Di Phar Lap, Eduardo Kelly, Der
Mann Von Snowy River. But I doubt
whether they have their hearts in the
work.
Whatever the building is called, and
whatever happens inside it, tourists will
come to look at the outside. In this
way it will justify its architect as surely
as the success of the Great Pyramid
justified the policy of Yernu-Tson.

Iris in the Wild Country
By APRIL HERSEY
NOVELIST Iris Murdoch, who is
touring Australia with her hus-
band, John Bayley, and lecturing
on moral philosophy and aesthetics for
the British Council, has been so well
received by local intellectuals,
apparently starved of ideas, that when
I saw her between planes in Sydney
she was in a state of physical exhaus-
tion.
At Perth, 600 people attended her
lecture. In Canberra the Bayleys were
rushed off their feet. Warring factions
of admirers kept spiriting the writers
away and literally kidnapping them. A
British Council man who had arranged
a luncheon found himself left standing
on the footpath while Miss Murdoch
was swept away; he still wonders who"
was host at his lunch party. Finally, an
evening party was thrown on such a
grand and exhausting scale that the
visitors from Oxford were almost de-
molished by Canberra hospitality.
Despite all this, Iris Murdoch is en-
joying her trip. “It is a most exciting
country,” she said. “I have only seen
a little of the wild country —bush, I
suppose you would call it, but the
color and light in the Australian land-
scape are quite different from Eng-
land. I have had a sense of this
from the paintings of Drysdale and
Nolan but it is extraordinary to see
that vision translated into the third
dimension.”
She is very anxious to see birds and
animals, if possible, in their natural
setting. A keen bird watcher, she
finds endless pleasure in the natural
life of the wild garden that surrounds
her 18th-century home near Oxford.
An almost aggressively plain person,
Iris Murdoch has the sturdy look of
the country. Her hair is cut short, and
she wears little or no make-up, and
loose, comfortable clothes. Her sandals
looked much like the ones the Romans
might have worn when they tramped
over Gaul. She gives a first impres-
sion of being almost frighteningly
efficient. But this is more the manner
of someone who has been involved in
lecturing and teaching for many years
an'd the crispness disappears when she
becomes interested in a subject. A
humorous, intelligent face, unlike the
romantic creatures of her novels.
Despite the demands of a highly suc-
cessful academic career at Oxford,
where she was a Fellow and Tutor
in Philosophy at St. Anne’s College for
many years, she has always known she
wanted to write novels. She began at
18 but regards all her attempts (about
nine of them) written before “Under
the Net” in 1954 as “bad —just rub-
bish, actually.” In 1953 she published
“Sartre, Romantic Rationalist” and, as
though this broke the spell, began on
a steady stream of novels.
She enjoys writing but is never satis-
fied with the result. She feels her
characterisation could be improved.
“My people are never based on any-
one. I know many novelists do this
adaptation of life thing successfully
but I would feel too bound by the
actual facts. However, I would like my
people to be more lively. I want to
have more variety and more vigor
in my characterisation. Life itself
is so full of people.”
She writes quickly, once the inventive
phase is over, but produces several
drafts of each book. She knows almost
completely what she will write when
she begins.
“I don’t know everything about the
book, of course,” she said. “It isn’t re-
Iris Murdoch
vealed to us completely when we begin.
I usually start with a nuclear situation
which places two or three characters in
a dilemma. Other characters naturally
collect around them, and the scenes
unfold. Often ideas come to me in
dreams. Sometimes I see whole scenes.
“I am not bothered by time. I like
to think I have an infinite amount of
time on each book, but, though one
could go on working, there comes a time
when the book declares itself finished
and I let it go.”
She has no idea what sort of an
audience reads her work. “I am glad
that there is an audience,” she said.
“But I can never imagine them. When
I am writing I have a vague sense that
eventually there will be someone read-
ing the book. But I don’t know what
manner of person.” Some of them reveal
their identities in letters. She answers
these personally.
“I don’t have any staff —except a
char who comes in once a week. I live
very quietly, as a matter of fact. We are
rather isolated where we are and, now
that I am writing most of the time, I
begin in the morning and work until
lunchtime. Then I do the washing or
the ironing or some other ordinary
thing until about four in the afternoon,
when I start writing again. I have a
tiny flat in London, too. When we are
there we see many friends, but we
don’t go out much at Oxford.”
Critics have praised Iris Murdoch’s
work for its allegorical content and
have claimed that each novel appears
to have several levels. It can be read
purely as fiction or it can be studied in
depth. This seems to puzzle the writer.
“I feel they are not always easy
books to read,” she said. “And all I
hope is that I present an intelligent
story. I suppose each book has a
general message and, because I am so-
involved with moral philosophy, I tend
to let the occasional philosophical theme
come up for discussion between charac-
ters, but I am not intentionally writ-
ing something on varying levels. I
think it would be a rare reader who-
would be searching for allegories.”
Born in Ireland of Anglo-Irish
parents, Miss Murdoch spent a great
deal of her childhood in the sort of
countryside she describes in her novel
“The Unicorn”—a rather desolate,,
dramatic part of Ireland. But she is
very fond of London where she aiso
lived as a child* She was educated
at the Froebel Educational Institute
in London, at Badminton School, Bris-
tol, and gained her MA at Somerville
College, Oxford. She did not marry
until she was in her late thirties. Her
husband is John Oliver Bayley, lecturer
in English aft Oxford.
Together they have travelled widely
in Europe and have ventured on a
brief lecture tour of Canada. So far
they have avoided accepting invita-
tions to lecture on the brutal United
States circuit, though Miss Murdoch
has been in America.
She is constantly drawn back into
the academic world from her fiction
writing and her very latest publication
is “Papers in the Proceedings of the
Aristotelian Society,” which brings to
mind the plight of Queen Victoria, who-
said: “I must have the next book
written by Lewis Carroll” and received
a tome on mathematics.
She likes to think that her writing
places her, modestly, in the mainstream
of English novelists; is an admirer of
Dickens and Jane Austen, and con-
siders that Tolstoy and Dostoevsky
having been adopted by the English,
are also in the stream.
She makes a modest living from her
work. “I am luckier than most writers
because my books sell and they are in
paperbacks. But I don’t think of it
as a means of making money. I can
and do make my living in other ways.
I don’t feel I have much more to con-
tribute than I have already shown. I
have no desire to write the greatest
English novel but just to go on writing,
each time a little better, perhaps, as
long as I can, for one never can be
sure that it won’t all go —the ideas,
the inspiration, or simply the desire to
write fiction.”


AROUND MELBOURNE
Selling us short on Derby Day
ON September 1, 1876, Mark
Twain wrote to Annie Web-
ster: “There is a sumptuous
variety about the New England
weather that compels the stranger’s
admiration and regret. The
weather is always doing something
there: always attending strictly to
business: always getting up new
designs and trying them on people
to see how they will go. But it gets
through more business in spring than
in any other season. In the spring I
have counted 136 different kinds of
weather inside of 24 hours.”
Of course, 136 is a paltry figure.
Melbourne is a city famous for its
sumptuous weather and we can do
better than that even in summer.
For example, one day that com-
pelled the stranger’s admiration was
February 6. On that day Jack
Bottomley, 53, a tubby tram con-
ductor, reported for duty at the
East Preston depot at 4.19 p.m.
Instead of wearing his regulation
thick, black, woollen serge, all-
season trousers, 10, he was wearing
a pair of neatly pressed white
shorts.
One hour later an inspector
caught him in Nicholson St. near
the Exhibition Building, and'he was
stripped of his tram, so to speak.
“I was flabbergasted,” said Jack.
Thereupon, Jack was suspended for
two days.
The Tramways Board chairman,
Mr. R. J. H. Risson, speaking like
a CMF major-general, which he
happens ' to be, said: “Every
employee knows the rules of attire,
and the rules must be obeyed. The
uniform is issued free and must be
worn.”
Indeed there is a beautiful sim-
plicity about the Tramways sum-
mer uniform. As Mr. Risson
admitted, in summer you just take
the jacket off.
The Tramways Union was out-
raged and the secretary, Clarrie
O’Shea, called for a 24-hour*
stoppage, announcing: “We have
tried many times to have shorts
provided as summer uniform. It’s
cruel that conductors and drivers
have to wear the same thick uni-
forms in summer and winter.”
Well, this sumptuous climate is
terribly unco-operative. On the day
that Board representatives agreed
to meet the union, there was a
southerly that was blowing un-
interrupted all the way from Maw-
son and most citizens were wearing
not orlly winter uniforms but over-
coats as well. The union put up all
sorts of proposals including dashing
new uniforms for the girls. The
Board agreed to look into the matter
and the strike was called off.
Ah, but when the Board an-
nounced its finding a hot sprinkler-
banner northerly was blowing, the
shorts were rejected, the dashing
uniforms were rejected. The only
win was a vague promise to look at
materials for lighter uniforms. The
next move was a strike at Preston
because a driver turned up in tan
shoes and the union is still threaten-
ing further action. The real reason
why the Board won’t provide uni-
forms is because it is faced with a
deficit of $1,500,000 and even if the
conductresses wore bikinis they
would be lucky to earn more
revenue.
Actually, though, we are all ter-
ribly proud of Jack Bottomley in
this good Sabbatarian town. On that
same fatal day when it was 105
degrees, the Southern Cross Hotel
refused to serve Mr. lan Scott, a
businessman, because he was wear-
ing shorts. Then recently we had
the case of the RACV Club. Mr. Ltfs
Green, director of Welman Controls
of England, left the club not wear-
ing a jacket to go off to play golf.
Suddenly he remembered his car
keys were upstairs. So he went back
and the commissionaire wouldn’t let
him in. “But . . . but,” he said, “I
live here. All my clothes are upstairs.
What will I do?” “I’m sorry, sir,”
said this commissionaire. “Those are
the rules of the club. You cannot
come in without a jacket.” He saw
himself wandering the streets of
Melbourne penniless for ever because
“Think of the saving in material
if we wear shorts."
he couldn’t get back into the club.
Then he was sly. He told the com-
missionaire: “Do you realise if you
don’t let me in I will never be able
to pay my bill.” That did it. How-
ever, the commissionaire was most
careful. He took Mr. Green round
the back way which they use for
depositing garbage cans and such and
snuck him in, coatless, that way.
Please do not think we are making
no progress at all. Oh, yes, tellers
at the E. S. and A. Bank are wear-
ing shorts, assistants in men’s wear
stores, operators in tourist bureaus,
workers in the Stock Exchange, and
workers in the Public Service wear
shorts.
Oh, the shorts manufacturers are
trying terribly hard to break us
down. For example, the Sydney firm
of Casben has even explained to
us the rich Australian tradition of
shorts. We are told that shorts be-
gan with the colonising Englishman.
The Englishmen always wore
what were tactfully known as “Bom-
bay bloomers” and they were kept
strictly for the colonies. It was the
Australians in the ’twenties who took
them up for domestic wear, and by
1935 we had redesigned them as a
sensible non-Bombay bloomer gar-
ment. The United States did not get
the idea of shorts until a quarter of
a century later. According to Cas-
ben, apart from the Jackie Howe
singlet this is the one fashion we have
given to the world.
We have had some help from the
clergy. The Reverend Gordon
Powell, of Scots Church, has said
that he doesn’t mind if the men
come to church in shorts and the
girls in mini-skirts.
However, we are a timid lot and
we still need sonu magnificent
gesture to get knees bared. It would
not surprise me if the VRC were
already working on this one. After
all, it was the VRC that launched
the mini-skirt with the “Shrimp.”
Undoubtedly, it will happen again
on Derby Day. The VRC will fly
out from London the world’s most
highly paid and most exciting male
model. Suddenly, after the third
race, he will arrive in a mini morn-
ing suit. He will have a grey top
hat, grey mini-tails, grey waistcoat,
striped shorts, and socks to match.
He will shock everybody by carry-
ing no gloves and no cane. As he
walks supremely along the front of
the Members’ Stand there will be
little gasps and groups of males
will huddle together in groups to
stare. It will make front pages all
over the world.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Last Link with
Impressionism
Kathleen O’Connor
By PATRICK HUTCHINGS
Kathleen o’connor, whose
ninetieth birthday r is being
honored with an Exhibition at
the Perth Gallery, represents perhaps
the last surviving link between Aus-
tralian painting and the School of Paris
of the early 1900 s.
Miss O’Connor is essentially a French
painter, and though her work enriches
Australian art, she is an Australian
by chance: by choice she would have
been a Frenchwoman. She was born
in Hokitika, New Zealand (and
appears in the Catalogue of the Salon
d’Automne for 1913, nee en Nouvelle-
Zelande, Irlandaise), coming to Wes-
tern Australia only as an adolescent in
1891, when her father, the noted en-
gineer C. Y. O’Connor, who later was
responsible for the Perth-Coolgardie
water pipeline, transplanted his family
from the provincial urbanity of Well-
ington to the raw colony on the Swan.
Kathleen never entirely approved the
move.
Like her fellow New Zealander and
contemporary Frances Hodgkins, Kath-
leen O’Connor began her training in
art in a small closed provincial circle,
learning something from it, chafing at
its limitations, and eventually escaping
into the great world. There was a
false start when she moved from Perth
to Sydney to work as a decorator,
there were a few months of apparent
compromise when she enrolled at the
Bushy School near London with von
Herkomer and Marmaduke Flower, but
the pull of the centre was strong, and
by 1908 Kathleen O’Connor was estab-
lished in Paris. She was soon writing
back enthusiastic paragraphs on Im-
pressionism and the state of European
painting for the “West Australian,”
somewhat to the embarrassment of
John Winthrop Hackett, who printed
her and paid her, but finally, in 1913,
begged her to desist.
Impressionism, which did not interest
the “West Australian’s” readers, had by
the 1900 s become sufficient of an ortho-
doxy among French painters to have
produced its own heresies, and Kathleen
O’Connor fell under three important
influences which were to make her an
impressionist and confirm her in one of
its mildly schismatic branches.
Looking back on her life in the late
19505, Kathleen O’Connor put at the
head of the list of painters who had in-
fluenced her work the Dutchman Isaac
Israels (1865-1934). Israels was, in
European if not in colonial terms, a
provincial himself: he was the son of
'the modestly distinguished Josef Israels
(1824-1911), a realistic painter of the
open-air school, and his early work re-
flects to a great extent his father’s ex-
ample. But, as sons will, Isaac Israels
reacted against the family style.
The influence of the younger Israels’
technique if not of his feeling can be
found in many of Kate O’Connor’s most
charming pictures, those groups of
women in the Luxembourg Gardens,
posed and poised in a world that seems
immune from all change and all vio-
lence. The elegant and preposterous hats
of the women are set down for us on the
picture in a few staccato dabs of paint;
as I write this I have in front of me
an unfinished O’Connor sketch of a
woman in a park, and a reproduction
of Israels’ The Races at Longchamps,
and the two show certain marked affini-
ties. Both are nervous and economical,
but remarkably solid, nevertheless, and
vivid.
She was duly grateful, persuading
Hackett to buy an Israels for the W.A.
Gallery, but she chose a rather bad

one perhaps it was inexpensive
and looking at this canvas in the 1960 s
it is hard to understand either how any-
one would come to be a disciple of
Israels, or why this work is still well
thought of in Holland. But he was a
better painter than this one picture
would suggest.
Kate O’Connor seems to have ex-
hibited in the Salon d’Automne for the
first time in 1913 when she showed two
sketches of which no trace has been
found so far. Part of the war she
spent in England, meeting Walter
Sickert (in May, 1917) and Lambert
and Longstaff, Mathew Smith, and the
painters of the Cafe Royal. Very few
of these meetings can be dated and
their influence cannot be detected in
any of Miss O’Connor’s paintings.
Indeed, the two strongest, most
notable influences of all are quite un-
dated. As one might deduce from her
paintings, Kate O’Connor was a dis-
ciple, and in fact protegee of Vuillard;
and as one might have suspected, again
from the paintings alone, an admirer of
De Segonzac. De Segonzac’s painting
is conservative and classical, and owes
as much to the precedents of Poussin
and the School of Fontainbleau as to
Impressionism, but it is perfectly and
purely French in its lucidity.
This quality of lucidity balances the
sometimes dangerously Impressionistic
tendency of Kathleen O’Connor’s paint-
ing, a tendency toward a surface treat-
ment which destroys all recession, re-
ducing space to simple modifications of
the texture of the picture plane. The
group of women in the Luxembourg
Gardens exhibits that tenue, as De
Segonzac called it, which assures the
organic development and wholeness of
a picture.
Vuillard’s influence is marked at a
number of levels; most obviously and
superficially in a point of technique.
Kathleen O’Connor follows Vuillard’s
practice of painting directly on to
ordinary cardboard, letting the original
drab color show through. This use of
cardboard, added to the influence of
Cherries in Perspective

De Segonzac’s low palette, produces a
very muted color range, far lower
indeed than Vuillard’s own, which
imparts a Proustian, reflective quality
to the subjects: as they were being
painted in their own pre-war world
these pictures were essentially recollec-
tions.
Kathleen O’Connor shares Vuillard’s
intimisme, but precisely as a foreigner
might be expected to share it. Where
Vuillard could paint his own family
and little circle of intimates in their
plain but rather beautiful bourgeoise in-
teriors, the Antipodean had to content
herself with groups of strangers in pub-
lic parks; and the Luxembourg figure
compositions all have the curiously
paradoxical air of being intimate
glimpses of strangers. The painter and
her subjects share a common light, and
a common silence, but no word passes
between them; even within the groups,
a sudden lull has fallen and nobody
speaks.
In the late ’2os and the early ’3os
Kathleen O’Connor took for a while
to a new medium, and developed a new
style. She began painting, in tempera,
elaborate natures mortes which, though
they clearly acknowledge the influence
of Cezanne, an influence that could not
fail to be felt in the Paris of the time,
remain at once conservative and essenti-
ally decorative. Where Cezanne seeks
to plumb the ultimate secrets of space
and its objects, the decorative painter
remains on the surface; this is his
metier. Kathleen O’Connor’s still-life
decorations they were exhibited in
the Arts Decoratifs section of the Salon
are sophisticated and elegant, some-
times rich to sombre in color, but some-
times, as in The Tea Table, high and
light. Where the Luxembourg paintings
show us an Edwardian world from
which grace and leisure will never de-
part, her still lifes show us a genuine,
but mistaken, optimism of the ’3os, the
clever, rational arrangements of a world
over which the coming war cast no
shadow.
JN the 1950 s Miss O’Connor returned
to Australia, once for a visit,
the second time to live for the rest
of her life among the scenes and the
faces of her girlhood. In her studios,
first in Fremantle and later in Perth,
she painted pictures French in style
and inspiration, into which the un-
subtle Australian light came to obtrude
itself more and more.
They are, and Australians must for-
give Miss O’Connor this, painted with
the detachment of someone for whom
the States in the Commonwealth are
still “the Colonies,” places where one
may live, but places without any de-
fined genius: places where life, and the
high hot light can put problems to be
solved, but where there are no nuances
to be caught. One is struck by the
sheer toughness and resilience of * Kath-
leen O’Connor’s craftmanship, which,
late in her life, could adapt itself to
a place quite outside its tonal and
emotional range: the Colonial, even,
as James said in another context,
“with thirty years of Europe on her
conscience” (of John Singer Sargent
in “The Guildhall and The Royal
Academy 1897”), remains essentially
and splendidly adaptable.
By becoming an Australian in the
first place, and by becoming, subse-
quently, as much a Frenchwoman as
she could, Kathleen O’Connor has
greatly enriched the artistic patrimony
of this continent. It is no longer
necessary for a young person who wants
to be a painter to cease to be an Aus-
' tralian, but painters here can still learn
a great deal from her exercise in
authentic self-exile, and Miss O’Con-
nor’s working-through of the Impres-
sionist idiom may be studied, with
profit, by painters whose interests and
sentiments are altogether nationalistic.
Note: Mr. Hutchings is at present
at work on a critical and biographical
essay on Miss O’Connor, and would be
grateful for information from anyone
who owns either pictures by her or
letters from her: anyone with informa-
tion which might be of interest is asked
to write to Mr. Hutchings, at the Arts
Faculty Building, University of W.A.,
Perth.

Getting into Print
Marlborough Graphics. Hungry Horse,
Sydney.
William Wright. Rudy Komon, Sydney.
Terry Sellers. El Dorado, Sydney.
IF anything should remove the notion
that there is something disparag-
ing in the remark that prints are
the poor man’s art, it is the Hungry
Horse’s display of brilliant graphics
from London’s Marlborough. These are
no substitutes, but the real thing, reveal-
ing how rewardingly new techniques
have been with a tantalising
imagery that is crisply presented in a
Lanceley or Pasmore and smudgily and
mysteriously in a Piper or Kitaj.
Marlborough Galleries are but one
of five institutions that now commission
printmakers Kitaj has forsaken
painting for it and 40 London gal-
leries have print sections; in Australia,
Gallery A and the South Yarra Gallery
are soon to implement print-making
projects. Only market analysis will be
able to tell whether prints are sold to
the disadvantage of paintings, and
sociologists whether the print-buyer is
considered the inhabitant of a limbo of
vicarious pleasures.
Graphics, of course, supply pleasures
that the lover of pure oil and water
color will never know: Kitaj’s shadowed,
faded, irrational imagery could be ob-
tained in no other way. He imposes a
row of paws and trees on sooty railway
lines or, in The Desire for Lunch is a
Bourgeois Obsessional Neurosis or Grey
Schizoids, places a glass of milk and
two pink posteriors in a large area cov-
ered with smudgy grey spots. Joe Tilson
celebrates more normal and expensive
eating with a large three-dimensional
matchbox from the Rainbow Grill; it’s
Pop pushed toward expressionism,
though of a very different kind from
Ceri Richards’ tempestuous illustration
to Dylan Thomas’ Do Not Go Gentle
into That Good Night. Generally, Rich-
ards, with a look towards the decorative
vitality of Braque and Matisse, avoids
that dark region, but Piper revels in
looming, gloomy Victorian buildings,
silk-screened photographs of which he
places on flaming red and black or on
lemon yellow as sour as Victorian Sun-
day.
Running counter to these is the crisp
clarity of Whiteley’s Animals, Nolan’s
Kelly, Richard Lin’s two black ovals
and one line, Gottlieb’s red sun glow-
ing above an exploding black star and
Pasmore’s Points of Contact, where a
line on a sensitive leash goes for a walk
to enclose space in soft contours and
then releases it in a set of angled
notations.
Sharp angles and lissom curves dom-
inate the work of William Wright, a
young Australian just returned from
England; he moves from some remark-
ably animated and powerful cubistic
charcoal drawings to fresh, flat abstrac-
tions, some brilliantly clear and some,
like an ochre disc in ochre or a powdery
blue disc around a square on faded
blue, most ephemeral. They display, in
their subtlety of form and color and
their symmetry, those virtues which
Patrick Heron, the visiting English
critic and painter, has lately been tell-
ing us are England’s contribution to
finding a way out of the blind and
blinding alley in which American paint-
ing finds itself.
Without believing all that, we can
see that Wright has something different
to say: he is not concerned with areas
of pressure like an Ellsworth Kelly; his
works, however much they are invaded
from the edges by tough reds and
greens, don’t look as though they have
been cut off from larger paintings, for
they have a self-sufficient, even if tense,
balance. The best works catch the
delight he feels in momentarily sus-
pending fleeting forms.
Nothing is fleeting in the sombre
pastes and inscribed earthy textures of
Terry Sellers, a young Englishman who
arrived here in 1963; the rhythms are
subterranean, the surfaces corroded,
weathered, coagulated, and almost as
lifeless as those of headstones, but the
incisions, cracks, and accumulations,
though they look like the results of
serendipity, have that human, deliber-
ated touch that makes these remote,
predestined grey, blue-grey, and dark
brown slabs stir from their repose.
However, the animation of a surface by
a circle or broad curve looks contrived
when imposed on thick material that
has its own life: he is better in the off-
white, crumbling Holos or in Cross,
which' is mainly a found piece of wood,
when he leaves well alone.
Sellers reminds us that the tomb and
rock have a majestic stillness that the
artists of gay levitation and skittish
graphic comment will never know;
what I said of Sellers recently may,
too, be said of Wright certainly a
welcome addition.

Asymmetry
THE articulation of areas of pure
color on large surfaces this
represents for Patrick Heron,
painter, critic, and judge of this year’s
Perth Invitation Prize, the central prob-
lem of contemporary western painting.
His choice of Guy Warren’s Poseidon
for first, and Sydney Ball’s Encounter
II for second prize, follows from first
principles; principles enunciated at
length, both at the opening of the Prize
Exhibition, and in a lecture on Color
given at the University of Western Aus-
tralia. And it is refreshing to have a
judge give his reasons, clearly and cate-
gorically.

bar, a red boat form, and a white sun
over four leaf-like appliques on the
left, presents a perfectly balanced asym-
metry. Heron mistrusts the symmetry of
much contemporary American hard-
edged color paintings, “its brutal impact
can be too easily mistaken for real
energy,” and the effortlessly achieved
balance of Warren’s painting, along with
its extraordinary softness, won it the
prize.
Ball’s Encounter II is by no means
soft, both its edges and its impact are
hard though it is asymmetrical: a
vast dark wishbone-like form with a
fluorescent line piercing it right to its
inner angle, it looks like a diagram
out of a book on wave mechanics,
blown up and painted up by a manic
commercial artist. And this is just how
it is meant to look. “Tough,” Heron
called it, “and not entirely successful,”
but it is a very powerful exercise in
its genre, with great areas of saturated
color modifying one another, and creat-
ing their own domestic dramas on a
large plain surface.
Patrick Heron sees Matisse as a
pivotal figure in modern painting, the
last of the figurative men, as well as
the first of the pure-color-area painters.
Allusion and the capacity of forms to
produce visual puns is by no means the
thing that Heron regards as central
to contemporary painting; “Painters
are never aware of the subject matter
of painting, only of the means, the
precise relation of abstract entities,
areas of color”; “one is lost in con-
templation of this abstract notation
contemplation of the physical fact of
color in which we find a sense of
extreme exhilaration.”
Patrick Heron’s theory of art has
nothing at all to do with imitation as
Aristotle defines it, in Poetics I,
“objects reproduced with minute
fidelity”; Heron and the painters he
most approves take us into the realm
of imitation of the Physics, where it is
no longer a matter of copying appear-
ances but of producing effects after
the pattern of nature.
Exciting, certainly: but it is no more
the whole of art than the other, Royal
Academy business was. Not that one
is carping; and one approves the choice
of prizewinners. But it is worth enter-
ing a caveat: art is always more than
the contemporary problems, its being
is altogether timeish, and total.

PERTH FESTIVAL, THEATRE
Familiar Failure
FAILURE is usually an unfamiliar
word in Perth at Festival time,
but this year it is being used with
uncomfortable frequency. A lukewarm
reception and cold houses for Bernard
Hesling’s “My Life” forced it to close
a week early and put the Playhouse
Theatre under unprofitable dustsheets
for ten days. A pity, because Hesling
was a big hit at the pre-Festival summer
school and did not deserve the anti-
climax.

and socialise in a Perth hotel after
regular licensing hours, ran into poor
patronage difficulties. The licencee
claimed he lost S2OO in the first two
weeks’ operations. “Perth people go
straight home after shows,” lamented
Festival boss John Birman, but Perth
still lacks the feeling between public
and artists and the absence of any Festi-
val atmosphere, such as you get during
Adelaide’s biennial two-week triumphs.
The Elizabethan Trust Opera Com-
pany’s “Tosca” opened at His Majesty’s
theatre in heat-wave conditions that
crushed performers and thinned out the
audience.
Ostoja-Kotkowski’s “Sound and
Image” started in the half-full Winthrop
Hall at the University with a bang
literally. The audience was deafened
into non-comprehension by the exces-
sive use of sound. Ironically on the
same night, the opposite was happening
at the packed (it was free) Iris Mur-
doch lecture in the ABC studios where
(shame, shame) most of the audience
could not hear and those who did
couldn’t understand.
Also in the same third week, the
three-day writers’ seminar was launched
with an address by “Meanjin” man
Clem Christesen, standing in as chair-
man for Max Harris, who was sick,
on the theme “The Writer in the Mod-
ern World.” Predictably, the first ses-
sion with 50 enrolments started with
an attack on the Australian public’s
attitudes toward artists and a list of
reasons (excuses?) given for the lack
of big writers and good literature.
Even though plain talking by some
writers, notably G. M. Glaskin and F.
B. Vickers, brought the sessions back
to earth at times, the same theme was
still being lamented three days later.
“The artist and the public are remote
from each other in Australia,” said
Christesen who would not have had
far to look for proof of his statement.
To compensate, three public evenings
of poetry and prose readings were given
under the “I Protest” banner and Peter
O’Shaughnessy gave excellent lunch-
time readings of Australiana.
What else? Well, we had some music,
pop bands free in the city centre and
ABC proms, expensive, at the Univer-
sity. Then the lack of lavatories in the
Supreme Court gardens threatened to
stop the pop concerts . . . but that’s
another story. And perhaps a more ex-
citing one than the Festival, too.
DUNCAN GRAHAM
MUSIC
Missing the Target
The Proms. Sydney Symphony Orches-
tra. Conductor, John Hopkins.
ACTUALLY, having painted the
garage last month, I feel quite
sympathetic. No matter how much
gloss I coaxed the roller to absorb, it
refused to leave a clean, sparkling
swathe of color. Instead, it squelched
gradually diminishing blotches which
demanded careful retouching before
they hid the flaking remains of last
summer’s handiwork. A similar fate
befell the young Sydney painter John
Peart as he plunged into the last three
movements (Green, Red, and Black)
of “Interaction,” the action-painting-
to-music event conceived by himself and
composer-soloist-conductor Nigel But-
terly. As a promotional gimmick for
themselves and the ABC, this sound-
and-image extravaganza was an un-
doubted success, but as the “highlight”
of the Prom series, it only served to
emphasise the problems of program-
ming which the fortnight’s music
revealed.
The enormous popularity of the 1966
Proms seemed to have led John Hopkins
and the ABC into a fundamental mis-
calculation. The young people who
lounge casually on assorted cushioning
for five evenings in early February are
in the main not the same “young
adults” who sit demurely at Youth
Concerts.
The Proms have become a definite
“thing” and are attended en masse by
the “I-arforg-classical-music-have-you-
got-the-‘Reader’s-Digest’-twelve -record-
Favorite-Selections-Album?” set. For a
considerable section of the audience,
the items of avant garde were tolerated


with interest rather than enjoyed, and
Hopkins’ well-intentioned nightly vpoon-
ful or two of this good medicine was
too open to a misinterpretation of
“talking down.” By the final concert,
an audience which had been exception-
ally well-mannered during performances
become restless. The white cushion
cover which was solemnly raised at
the end of an umbrella during the
maths music of lannis Xenakis’ “Pith-
oprakta” was for many an apt expres-
sion of regretted surrender. Contem-
porary music is certainly a vital part
of any Prom series, but it could achieve
far more if it were programmed in a
more subtle and enjoyable manner.
Of the orchestral performances,
Hopkins’ account of the Shostakovich
Symphony No. 11 was outstanding.
Alternately immense and contracted,
the work demands precise graduation
and control of its internal relation-
ships. This quality the “strategy” of
pacing and dynamics is perhaps
Hopkins’ greatest strength, and his con-
ducting here (as in the Vaughan Wil-
liams and Mahler symphonies) was a
wonderfully executed model of detailed
conception being sustained throughout
the performance. The orchestra res-
ponded with the crispness and power
not heard since the concerts it gave
shortly before departing for the Com-
monwealth Festival in 1965.
An attractively authoritative display
of sensitivity and technique, Gordon
Watson’s performance of the Saint-
Saens G minor Piano Concerto easily
overshadowed the efforts of other solo-
ists. His tendency toward light-hearted
Interpretation enhanced the Allegro
scherzando and Presto movements with
an irresistible rhythmic bounce. Kiang
Hwa’s singing of the Canteloube set-
tings of the “Chants d’Auvergne” was
as captivating as her appearance.
One would be forgiven on the
strength of its massed performance in
the third Prom program, for mistaking
the title of the Berlioz “Te Deum” for
“Tedium.” While not the brand of
Berlioz that doubles adrenalin output,
the “Te Deum” seems a good deal more
exciting in score than the Hopkins-
Hurstville (and others) collaboration
could manage.
Of the contemporary music per-
formed, Penderecki’s “Threnody for
the Victims of Hiroshima” (title com-
posed after music) was the most inter-
esting. Both it and the Takemhsu
“Textures” were successful experiments
in sound. “Pithoprakta” emerged from
wooden beginnings to a climax which
sounded suspiciously like a tape of a
Rossini overture .being run on fast
rewind.
Australian contemporary music was
well represented and as usual, Peter
Sculthorpe’s “Irkanda IV” demon-
strated by contrast how little progress
the atonal Meale and Butterley have
made. “Irkanda” was well played by
Donald Hazlewood and the orchestra,
confirming my impression that it is
still the finest Australian work of this
decade.

A Lily in Little India. Donald Howarth.

THE title conjures up an image of
exotic lushness, but the actual set-
ting of the play is a small North-
country town in England. However,
the title is not altogether misleading,
for the play is something of a jungle
in which melodramatic events sprout up
out of tea-and-toast realism, and the
characters are playing music-hall
comedy at one moment and Jacobean
drama the next.
The characters are a son and his
widowed mother, a daughter and her
widowed father, and the postman, who
is the widow’s lodger. The lusty widow
and the lodger provide the low comedy,
the boy is a kind of modern lower-
class Hamlet, who takes refuge from
his mother’s behaviour in horticulture
and grows a beautiful lily in a pot
behind his locked bedroom door, while
the senile father and his bitter daughter
are, in this production, like a couple
of lonesco characters.
The muddle in the play is reflected
in the precipitous multi-level stage set-
ting which, on three realistic levels,
shows the interiors of two houses, while,
on a fourth abstract level, there is an
oblong black box, which represents
variously a field, a library, and a
cemetery.
Producing this play must have been
like producing several plays at once
and Doris Fitton does not manage the,
probably impossible, feat of welding it
into a coherent whole. Ross Thomp-
son, in an excellent performance, makes
( the boy a very sympathetic character.
He is not helped by Margo Lee’s
determinedly music-hall mother, but
Robert Quilter’s self-satisfied postman
is well done, and the lily at all stages
is a splendid plant.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
TELEVISION
The Crunch
Interview. Channel 9.
People. ABC-TV.
THERE are many ways of inter-
viewing people on television —-
the Muggeridge alkaline bath, the
acid of an American “Meet the Press,”
the pointless pleasantries of a Don
Lane, the hammerings of the BBC’s
man Frost, and last of all, the gormless
questionings of Bob Sanders and Tony
Charlton, practitioners of what I
assume must be the Australian way.
This is to choose the best of an in-
different collection of interviewees and
proceed to ask them the most
ridiculous questions imaginable. It is a
clever adaptation of the overseas
method, which makes the interviewed
squirm and even cry out. Our men do
that to the viewer.
Bob Sanders can be excused for
gaffes made on the run, as he tries to
carry his show along at such a pace
that sometimes the set resembles a
parade of interweaving marchiqg girls.
But Tony Charlton runs his show as if
he were conducting the Surprise sym-
phony. Last week he was at his desk,
mumbling, shuffling papers, giving the
occasional disarming smile, when sud-
denly he applied the crunch to “Pancho”
Gonzales, asking, “Do you think Fred
Stolle will make the grade, or is he a
costly flop?”
Obviously a man of iron nerve, Mr.
Gonzales refrained from replying, “How
about you answer that, Tony?” so that
if anyone was going to commit a
slander and be sued for his sox, it would
have to be Mr. Charlton. I, the viewer,-
lulled to the edge of sleep, shot up-
right; transfixed, not by the drama of
the occasion, but by wonder at the
interviewer’s skill in framing the non-
sequitur.
Slander apart, anyone in business as
an interviewer surely has a duty to be
familiar with his subjects’ interests, and,
either frame his questions sensibly with-
in those interests or take the interview
into less familiar ground. Asking Gon-
zales for opinions of other players, or
racing drivers for similar statements
as Charlton did next, is worthless
television.
My personal choice of a man who
stands out locally as an interviewer is
Brian Davies, of Channel 7 News in
Sydney. Davies’ method is to shape the
tenor of the interview before it begins,
so that the subject’s views and Davies’
summation have a unity, and give the
viewer a definite impression of an event,
even though it may be an arguable
impression.
If this method were transferred to
an interview program, it might have
some faults but it would never amount
to 30 or 60 minutes of what can only
be called non-TV; the ambling routine,
the feckless questions, and the failure to
improve on a blank screen.

FILMS
Hitchcock’s Bore
Torn Curtain. Director, Alfred Hitch-
cock.
Return From the Ashes. Director, J.
Lee Thompson.
Rogopag. Various directors.
1 SUPPOSE it had to happen,
though I never believed it would:
Hitchcock has made a boring film.
And not even a genuine, get-up-and-
walk-out bore just the sort of
capable, derivative, suspenseless thriller
which, if somebody else’s name was
on the credits, would be rubbished as
“imitation Hitchcock.”
The plot is promising enough. An
American scientist apparently defects
to Russia and goes behind the Iron
Curtain, followed by his disapproving
assistant, who is also his fiancee. Of
course, he is really on our side and
has gone to East Berlin for important
scientific information. Having obtained
it with remarkable ease from a Com-
munist physicist, our hero has the job
of getting himself, information, and
no-longer-disapproving girlfriend back
to the West.
The familiar machinery is well oiled;
the soft, bright color, as unreal as a
cigarette commercial, is agreeable. So
is Paul Newman, though he is no more
believable as a physicist than he is as
a traitor. Julie Andrews has little to
do but look plucky and bewildered. In
her brief appearance as a sad, ratty
Polish exile, Lila Kedrova makes more
impact than the big stars do during the
entire movie. <
Two different films seem to have
got mixed up in “Return From the
Ashes.” The pre-credit sequence, in
which a Dachau survivor, drained of
all emotion by her own suffering,
reacts with indifference to the acci-
dental death of a child, promises well.
But when our heroine gets home to
Paris to find her husband carrying on
with her stepdaughter, the whole thing
degenerates into one of those pictures
which Stanwyck or Crawford did more
entertainingly—which may be summed
up as who’s going to murder whom,
when? Ingrid Thulin and Maximilian
Schell are too good for this sort of
thing. As for J. Lee Thompson’s direc-
tion well, we all have our off days.
The four big-name directors (Rosel-
lini, Godard, Pasolini, and Gregor-
etti), who made the omnibus-film
“Rogopag,” all seem to have been
having ofLdays, too. Though it is por-
tentously introduced by the statement
that this is their view of the end of
the world, the four stories are essen-
tially trivial, and with the exception of
the Pasolini sequence show little inven-
tion in their presentation. Pasolini does
contrive some sharp commentary on the
big biblical epic, and handles the
camerawork in a lively way.

BOOKS
The Poet as Sponger
By JAMES KIRKUP
Selected Letters of Dylan Thomas.
Edited by Constantine Fitz Gibbon.
Dent. $5.65.
IHAVE never yet encountered a poet
I really liked not an English
poet, that is. Japanese poets are
human beings. But we are the most
awful stinkers. Dylan Thomas was no
exception, as this very cagy selection
of letters reveals, especially if it is read
in conjunction with the editor’s masterly
biography of the poet, “The Life of
Dylan Thomas.” Reading these letters
brings back with nauseating vividness all
the nastiness of Thingland, and in
particular London—Soho and Blooms-
bury—during and after World War 11.
Here we find all the bitchiness, the
back-scratching, the pettiness, and pro-
vincial uncharm of modern British
letters, as well as the fatal legend of
the drunken poet, now so out of date,
but which English versifiers still seem
set on perpetuating. One only has to
flip through David Wright’s Penguin
anthology, “The Mid Century: English
Poetry 1940-60,” to find how fixated
on beer his contributors are. The
English poet’s passion for our sour,
weak, lukewarm national drink is some-
thing quite incomprehensible: perhaps
it accounts for much of the sour verse
produced in the last two decades. On a
recent visit to London (incognito) I
spent a few hours wandering around
the pubs of Soho, many of them, like
the Swiss and the French, mentioned
in this book, and found the same old
figures, the poets who helped Dylan
to drink himself to death, mopping up
their disgusting pints, looking grey and
spiritless, living on dead memories,
chasing the ghost of their victim.
For Dylan was killed by the British
as much as by the Americans. Poets
will go to absolutely any lengths to do
each other down: they disposed of
Thomas by drinking him to death.
Judging by the spate of reminis-
cences and ugh! prompt com-
memorative elegies that followed the
poet’s death, I was practically the only
writer in England who had never met
the Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive.
In fact, I did see him a few times,
usually at a distance, as I see most
people. Once was at a racetrack, where
he put me on to a winner named Chris-
tabel; another time was at the Man-
drake Club, a dreary basement dive in
Meard Street (what a name! merde!)
under David Tennant’s slightly posher
but equally boring Gargoyle Club,
which plays a small part in this book.
Dylan, in a state of complete alcoholic
chaos, was making not very effective
passes at the infinitely compliant but
indifferent Italian waitresses as they
shrugged past him with trays of drinks.
He was not a pretty sight in those days,
one far removed from Augustus John’s
portrait of him in his Dionysiac youth
reproduced on the cover of this volume.
He was bloated, bragging, balding,
truculent, sweating, peevishly trying to
wheedle money and drinks. That
occasion at the Mandrake must have
been late in 1952, after the publication
of the “Collected Poems” and before
his departure on his final, fatal visit
to America. I could not connect this
figure with the poet whose work often
dazzled me—it still does. I wondered
if some of the great poems he had
written had been divine flukes, or the
automatic writings of an innocent soul
in a state of hellish trance.
Thomas himself refers to this likeli-
hood, which seems to have disturbed
him, in one of his jumbo letters to,
of all people, Pamela Hansford John-
son, with whom at one time he
fancied himself in love:
. . *. I received a rather disquieting
note from Richard Rees, of the
Adelphi, who . . . accused me—not in
quite so many words—of being in the
grip of devils. “The poems have an
unsubstantiality, a dream - like
quality,” he writes, “which non-
plussed me.” He then goes on to
say that the poems, as a whole,
reminded him of automatic or trance
writing.
Thomas goes on to say that auto-
matic writing is worthless as literature,
and that “my facility, as he calls it, is,
in reality, tremendously hard work.”
Perhaps the most valuable passages in
this book are those in which Dylan
talks about his own methods of writing
poetry, and in which he painstakingly
analyses work that was quite unworthy
of his attention by inferior writers
(usually well-off and generous to the
Poet as Sponger). Yet even in these
writings about his own work (he was
not really interested in the poetry of
his equals) there is an inflated, egotis-
tical, boastful note which becomes
exasperatingly monotonous. Again and
again he tells correspondents about the
magazines in which his poems are being
printed, and usually joins to this a
request for money.
Why was he always asking people
to send him money? He can’t have
been that badly off all the time, what
with his fees for poems, his work in
films and for the BBC (which I once
heard him refer to as the “brutish
breadbasket slaughteration”). He just
wanted money for nothing, he wanted
money in place of love, as a compulsive
eater eats as a compensation for an
Dylan Thomas
unsatisfactory emotional life. Of course,
he wanted the cash for drink, too, but
he nearly always says he needs it to
support Caitlin and the kids, to pay
domestic debts and keep the duns from
the door. I simply cannot believe all
that. Money was an obsession. Per-
haps it was something to do with his
passion for numbers, which can be seen
extraordinarily well in a poem like
“Poem in October,” where the rigid
syllable-counting is fanatical: the
syllabic pattern is exactly the same in
every verse, excepting for one extra
syllable in line 6, verse 6: “Summer-
time of the dead whispered the truth of
his joy,” which has thirteen syllables,
whereas the sixth line in all the other
verses has twelve.
He had the usual British capacity for
humbug, backscratching, and spite, as
can be seen in his peevish attacks on
people like Grigson, Spender, and Edith
Sitwell, attacks which were turned to
adulation whenever the person con-
cerned gave him a nice review or
printed one of his poems.
One of Thomas’ saving graces in this
collection of letters is his humor. He
is always trying to hit off witty re-
marks, and some of them are really
funny, as when he refers to his drinking
bouts on visits to London as “capital
punishment” and to the grey eminence
of English letters as “Pope Eliot.”
(This reminds me of Beachcomber’s
“poetry bishops.”) Dylan remarks:
“Whenever I switch on the wireless it’s
an interval,” and one smiles, knowing
exactly the sort of thing he means.
Some of his parodies of his own work,
addressed to Tommy Earp, are terribly
funny, but quite frighteningly close to
the real thing. In a sense, his life itself
was one long self-parody, as was per-
haps some of his poetry. This element
of creative self-immolation is most
evident in the recordings he made of
his work, which are painful to listen to.
He sounds like the frog who
kept puffing himself up until he burst.
There he goes, screwing himself up in
a curiously impotent way, blasting
himself up to ever higher and ever-
less-attainable climaxes: his reading,
like his poetry, his life, and his lolly-


love, is like the constantly interrupted
and comically unrealised orgasms of a
sneeze that never comes off.
Thomas was both victim and execu-
tioner. He was his own worst friend.
He would have approved of Baude-
laire’s phrase: “II serait doux peut-etre
d’etre alternativement victime et
bourreau.” The tragedy is that it was
all so unnecessary. If he had not, with
the connivance, conscious or otherwise,
of his British and American friends,
set out to destroy himself, he would
have written infinitely better poetry.
He could have been the greatest poet
of our time. Instead, he has merely
become its greatest poetic legend. The
movie should be a smash hit, when it
comes to be made, as it almost certainly
will.
A Demon Lover
By LEONIE KRAMER
Casualties of Peace. Edna O’Brien.
Cape. $2.65.
THE last novel by Edna O’Brien that
I read was “Girls in their Married
Bliss.” Its predominant note was
one of cheerful vulgarity, with an under-
tone of disillusionment hardly emphatic
enough to be disturbing. “Casualties of
Peace” has some of the same ingredients
but in very different proportions. The
vulgarity is apt to turn into melan-
choly or nostalgia; its disillusionment is
harder to combat. In the earlier book
humanity seemed bound to survive,
even to triumph, through sheer aggres-
sive determination and toughness. In
“Casualties of Peace” frustration seems
inevitable.
Human adjustments are made too
late, or not at all. Satisfaction is with-
held, or denied. People prove too frail
to carry the burden of their own desires.
Violence erupts when courage and
reason fail, but even violence is freak-
ishly frustrated.
This is not, however, a sombre book.
It has that curiously effervescent quality
that distinguishes Edna O’Brien’s writ-
ing. Even the most ordinary objects are
brought into sharp focus. People move,
speak, think, and act with sharpness
and definition. While reading the novel
one has a very strong sense of life actu-
ally being lived, here and now. Shapes,
colors, and sounds are real. One gasps
through a nightmare with its victim,
and wakes up with relief to find that
the paralysing chase is over.
These very virtues of immediacy and
plausibility are not without their dan-
gers. After a while the clear impressions
fade, and objects lose their glamor,
even their interest. When this happens
one looks for what has remained of all
the life so lustily displayed. For me
the answer is very little. Well con-
structed though Miss O’Brien’s world is,
for me there is no incentive to enter
it again. Nor have her five characters
sufficient depth to compel more search-
ing acquaintance.
A sixth character appears only in the
recollections of the woman for whose
neurotic frustration he is responsible,
and he, too, though undoubtedly a
“presence,” evokes neither sympathy
nor disgust. In a word, this is a slight
novel, easy to read, and easy to forget.
For its characters, though in one sense
they are so firmly rooted in reality,
never really grow and develop. When
toward the end we read “ ‘Entries in
the heart are not like entries in ledgers,
they cannot be crossed out.’ The more
you try the more unsightly the inner
page becomes, which is why I always
say that memory is the bugger,” we
might well give our assent to the propo-
sition. We might agree, too, that the
proposition has been illustrated, if not
actually proved, by the study of the
sculptress Willa, which is central to
the novel. Yet it does not really take
hold upon the imagination. It seems
almost too simple to be true, just as
Edna O’Brien’s world sometimes seems
too well controlled to be a place of such
sorry frustration.
To say this is at the same time to pay
tribute to the technical accomplishment
of the novel. It is cleverly designed and
skilfully executed. The presence of
Willa’s demon lover Herod is felt not
only through her nightmare memories
of him but in the end through her own
story of her relationship with him, told
through a series of letters which forms
the last section of the novel. This is
not an easy device to handle, but Miss
O’Brien manages her effects well, and
one leaves the novel with exactly the
right feeling of regret for lost years and
lost opportunities. This being so, it may
seem ungrateful to suggest that
technical adroitness has its own dangers.
At Pompolona Hut
(Easter Sunday)
As a first few spots of rain
began to fall, fog swung like
a church door to hide the pass
just after sundown: I took
a track where no true track was
up the bouldered creek, on thin
ledges and pebbles, over
pools where sandflies breed, to find
my wife and son; caught sight of
her jersey’s blue flag beyond
a bend in the creek. There, safe
as a headstone, a glacier
the height of five men, made by
ice dropped in avalanches
from the sky-high rock, had gripped
their fancy. Below the ice
a cave like a tramshed shaped
by water had dragged the boy
in to meditate (no doubt
on matters of Venus) though
the air had darkened. That bone-
white pitted sepulchre threw
me off balance, Death’s own bam
roofed with rotting grass. I cut
three gritty flakes from the wall
with a rock chip in order
to honor the Trinity,
tasting the sweet death. After,
we scrambled back down to the
hut before the dark rain fell.
JAMES K. BAXTER


The Vicious Victorians
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
The Age Of Optimism. James Laver.
Weidenfeld and Nicolson. $B.
MANNERS and Morals 1848-1914”
is the sub-title of this book and,
as James Laver has had to pack
the whole vast panorama into 250
pages, the result is a rather scrappy
compilation, but a highly diverting
and instructive one, nonetheless. What
makes the period such a rich quarry
for the social historian is that never
before or since was there such an
enormous gulf between public and pri-
vate morality between what people
held up as their standards of be-
haviour and how they actually behaved.
A romantic nostalgia for Victoriana is
the fashion these days. It is chasten-
ing to be reminded occasionally of
the other side of the picture and, pace
James Laver’s disputable label for the
age, his book certainly does so.
It is easy enough to conjure up a
half-humorous,, half-patronising affec-
tion for Gothic Revival architecture,
Samuel Smiles biographies and funny
little paperweights. But you need a
pretty strong stomach to peer into the
netherworld where Chadwick and May-
hew, W. T. Stead and Gustave Dore,
scavenged. The buoyant, booming,
self-confident High Victorian and
Edwardian age was also the age of the
filthiest poverty, the most callous and
degrading prostitution and the most
soulless pursuit of material gain the
world has probably ever seen.
One of the eye-opening illustrations
in this exceptionally well-illustrated
book is a photograph of the girls in
the brothel in the Rue des Moulins
where Toulouse-Lautrec lived and
painted. Toulouse-Lautrec is often
regarded as an uncompromising realist
but the photograph reveals how much
even he idealised the lower depths of
the Parisian demi-monde. There is not
much Moulin Rouge glamor about these
brutalised, coarse-featured harpies with
their pendulous breasts and painted
nipples. In fact, James Laver has
turned up a really astonishing collec-
tion of pictures, perhaps assisted by
the fact that he was for years Keeper of
the Department of Prints at the Vic-
toria and Albert Museum. They form
a marvellous commentary on the text,
and illuminate more brilliantly than a
heap of quotations the bizarre corners
of social life from the Year of Revolu-
tions to the thunder-laden sunset glow
of the Edwardians.
When Mr. Laver’s period opened the
last vinous corseted survivors of the
Regency bucks still occupied the bow
windows of the London clubs, the
great territorial aristocracy still ruled
the political roost despite the Reform
Bill, and English life was still full of
raw Hogarthian violence in the brawl-
ing streets, the gin palaces and the
bare-knuckle prize rings. But the pros-
perous middle classes were fast enter-
ing into their inheritance. From the
centre of London their rows of tall,
stucco-faced palazzi stretched west-
ward, street after street, square after
square, with their armies of over-
worked and under-paid servants. Their
villas covered the umbrageous slopes
of Norwood and Sydenham. They ate
huge meals, built countless gloomy
churches, subscribed to clothe the naked
heathen, grumbled about income tax
at sixpence in the pound while the
tribute of empire poured into their
coffers.
The landed lords of creation, rich
in splendid rakes and eccentrics, had
never been very strong on moral prin-
ciples. The new commercial lords were.
If they couldn’t extinguish the Old
Adam of human vice they could at
least try to push it down decently out
of sight and mind. That they did not
succeed was apparent to the most
casual wayfarer in mid-Victorian Lon-
don. From the gaudy gaslit splendors
of places like Kate Hamilton’s to the
8000 drabs who perambulated the streets
round Leicester Square, the Strand, and
Piccadilly, London presented a spectacle
that shocked visitors from every corner
of the world.
Disraeli coined the phrase about the
“two nations” to describe the fantastic
contrast between the lives, morals, and
codes of behaviour of the very rich and
the very poor in mid-19th century Eng-
land. By the end of the age public
education, a cheap Press and rising
standards of living were .helping to
bridge the abyss. At the same time the
facade of. Victorian respectability was
steadily eroded in cosmopolitan
Edwardian high society. The manners
and morals of 1910 were very different
from those of 1880. With the decline
in hypocrisy came a softening in the
cold, inhuman callousness that makes
the seamy side of the Victorian social
scene so peculiarly repulsive. Anyone
who doubts it should read W. T. Stead’s
indictment of the white slave traffic of
the 1880 s.
They ordered things somewhat dif-
ferently across the Channel. At least
there is an appealing shamelessness
about the meretricious gaiety of
France’s Second Empire, when
glorious hussies like Cora Pearl and
Hortense Schneider flitted like parakeets
through the Bois de Boulogne and
helped establish an Entente Cordiale
with the Prince of Wales. One of
James Laver’s best stories concerns the
death of President Faure, succumbing
from an overdose of aphrodisiacs in the
arms of his mistress and then being laid
out in full evening dress (with decora-
tions) for the official death-bed
photographs.
Theatres and music halls, art, litera-
ture, and politics, bicycles, bloomers,
and biblical controversies —James Laver
has assembled a fascinating scrapbook
of information and illustration and an
excellent companion to the more
orthodox histories of the period.
Oxford Gossip
By RODNEY HALL
A Learned City. Philip Toynbee.
Chatto and Windus. $1.25.
,
R. TOYNBEE b book, described
as a novel in verse, is the
third part of a trilogy The
learned city is Oxford. As a whole, the
work is intended to reveal the charac-
ters of two men: Richard Abberville, an
undergraduate, and his grandfather,
Professor Nielson, who is about to retire
from the Chair of Nordic Literature.
The period is just after World War I.
On the surface, “A Learned City”
appears to be a duologue. But, in fact,
it is two soliloquies developed side by
side complementing each other, but
never becoming direct interchange. The
result is a sense of gradual revelation
rather than discourse. The tone varies
according to the speaker; English under-
graduate jargon alternating with slabs
of erudition.
Fie, fie to hide my phiz,
My gross mug as I teeter past
The Viking eye, the brass halloo
Of Nielson at his window!
This sort of thing might well strike
the Australian reader as mannered and
precious. So, in a different way, might
the old professor’s preoccupation with
savage reminiscence and university poli-
tics. His rambling lines are full of
incredible self-importance:.
Hell is peopled by professors; ruled
by wardens, deans, and
Masters ...
Vice-Chancellor Satan maddens the
students with a bad text . . .
Mr. Toynbee’s book might well have
found its justification in the anger that
runs through it. But this is the anger of
one trapped impotent and tiresomely
repetitive. Besides which it is directed
against the very establishment of which
he so obviously sees himself as part;
and in terms addressed Vnainly to fel-
low Oxonians. The effect is that of a
rather sick confessional. I suspect that
“A Learned City” was intended as an
attack by exposure. If so, it’s a failure.
Parts of it might seem to succeed (in
a fine rage he writes: “A place of learn-
ing? A vast boudoir all abuzz with
spite;/ A board where bishops bend
their cloven heads to nodding knights”),
but this kind of thing is buried deep in
old-boy rib-nudging, in quaint allusions
and abstruse slang. So often the expres-
sion takes the sting from any satirical

intention. It L as if he pretends a
toughness of attitude to the university
which he does not feel.
Structurally, the whole unusual work
is rather well formed. Old Abberville
Richard now grown old speaks as a
kind of impartial narrator at the begin-
ning and at the very end. Apart from
this, he is used only once; right in the
middle, which allows him to comment
briefly on what has been told already
and to reinforce the reader’s awareness
of period, to establish more firmly the
fate of Richard himself. This fate, inci-
dentally, is that he becomes like his
grandfather, reconciling the conflict of
personalities.
The parallel monologues I find dull
and static, but they are skilfully man-
aged. Old Nielson dominates the first
part, whereas in the second part
Richard begins to take over. Although
the passage of time is rarely mentioned,
several years do elapse between the be-
ginning and the end: And the attitudes
and vitality of the characters change
accordingly the old man fading, the
young man beginning to challenge him
and to question his infallibility.
Ideally, I think “A Learned City”
should be read at a sitting. An enormous
number of people are referred to by
name only,- and this can become confus-
ing, particularly as some of them turn
out to have profound effects on the two
speakers and on their self-revelatory
soliloquies; these are easily forgotten,
having scant personality, yet some of
them prove vital to understanding what
has happened in the past and is hap-
pening in the present. In this, as in
other regards, the book is reminiscent
of “Pale Fire” though without Nabo-
kov’s sharp, clear wit.
By and large, “A Learned City”
strikes me as an irritating book. A story
of covert love-making and college gos-
sip told in obscurantist language pep-
pered with Latin, French, German, and
Norwegian. It’s full of little “in” ref-
erences that are, at best, only partially
comprehensible to those who do not
know Oxford.
Arch misquotations and adapted
images are crammed in wherever pos-
sible. “What parched and scrannel
‘propositions’ squeak from his wind-
pipe” is, for instance, an obvious muti-
lation of Milton’s lines, “their lean and
flashy songs/Grate on their scrannel
pipes of wretched straw . . .” Physical
nastiness also appears to fascinate him;
disease, scabs, pus and mucus, all com-
mand close attention at one time or
another. This is very modish of Mr.
Toynbee. No doubt the current rejec-
tion of gentility in England assures him
of willing readers for this kind of thing.
There is plenty in “A Learned City”
that’s both offensive and boring. Even
in its most favorable aspect, the book
seems to be exclusively for Oxonians
with a passion for crossword puzzles.
Imagine a Region
Imagine, reader, a region without a past,
As you respect the past, and which the future
Could return to those who owned it in their dreams,
Who dreamed down upon it across the vast
And golden gulf that made a myth from nature
More real to them than our discovery seems.
Imagine its cities raised in a history
So brief they bear foundations into the shallows
However high they reach or heavy the wall,
And which new times, like the old we cannot see
With those same eyes of our longer threshold fellows,
Could give to the first myth deeply raised on all.
Imagine, among all, the uttermost loneliness
That we the latter abide who need the legend
We could not possess when we possessed the truth,
Who labor as latecomers still to impress
Our strange survival with both truth and legend
So none shall doubt our right to dwell by both.
Imagine, reader, the so unequal task
That we in the land we struck have undertaken
Over its own reality and theirs,
They who made it as golden as dreams could ask
In an ancient civilisation not forsaken
Which yet may win what it saw, as it wants or dares.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
States of Conflict
AS with international or marital relations, Commonwealth-
State financial relations are never going to be solved.
The different partners have separate interests, which
will go on causing problems as long as the opposing partners
survive to live and assert themselves. But acceptance of the
inevitability of a continuing clash of interests does not mean
there is no scope for conflict resolution, peacemaking, and a
bit of marriage guidance. For too long the Commonwealth
and States have staggered along from Premiers’ Conference
to Premiers’ Conference, from Budget to Budget. Hap-
hazardly various expedients have been adopted and, being
taxes, these expedients have become part of the system.
While no major review has been made and no guidelines
laid down, the demands on Governments have changed
radically. The States have been called on to provide massively
increased schooling, while the Commonwealth has had to
double our defences and provide seemingly unlimited
amounts for universities. The future is bound to see new
demands develop. Our ports will have to be adapted to the
coming revolutions in shipping, to take advantage of con-
tainerisation and the like. The capital cities are, like big
cities everywhere else in the industrialised world, slowly
strangling through traffic congestion; but, unlike other coun-
tries we have made no serious start on urban expressways.
Much money is going to have to be found for taking full
advantage of natural gas and cheap new sources of power.
If each of these, and all the other projects which are bound
to project themselves into the political arena, are tackled in
an entirely ad hoc manner, there will be unnecessary con-
fusion, waste, and delays. Mr. Holt’s recent promise to make
a major survey of Commonwealth and State taxing powers
is most welcome. We can only hope that it is thorough and
imaginative.
The Prime Minister was prejudging the issues rather in
saying at his Press conference last Friday that the Common-
wealth may find it has to tell the States to seek new tax-
fields because it cannot afford to hand any over. That may
be the conclusion, dictated by the fact that Australia will
have to continue in the foreseeable future to spend heavily
on defence and foreign aid. But the least the States can
justifiably demand is that the Commonwealth make clear
where it expects them to go for extra revenue. There is, after
all, an understanding that, with acceptance of its general
financial assistance grants, the States bind themselves not to-
disturb the existing pattern of tax sharing.
Of course, it is already being disturbed, as the States,
impose an increasing variety of stamp duties. In Western
Australia a recent amendment to the Stamp Act makes all
transactions subject to a duty of 0.1 percent. Until now, of
course, stamp duty has only applied to transactions over
$lO or so, and the amendment changes the whole nature of
the tax. A whole vast range of purchases—at supermarkets,
department stores, and petrol stations, for instance—comes
within its ambit. It becomes, in fact, a turnover tax, and
there is no reason why it should not be elevated into one of
the State’s major sources of revenue. (The West German
Government, incidentally, gets more from turnover taxes
than from income tax.) There are two difficulties. The Com-
monwealth could turn nasty and give the project the thumbs
down as it did to Sir Henry Bolte’s proposed marginal
income tax. Secondly, the courts could throw it out because
it comes dangerously close to being an excise tax, something
which the Constitution reserves for the Commonwealth.
So the Commonwealth has to come up with some guide-
lines. If it concludes it cannot vacate any tax fields, it might
MEN AND MATTERS
THERE is a moral somewhere in
the fact that ’ the three former
Sydney journalists turned mem-
bers of the Stock Exchange are now all
“sole traders”; after spending some
time in partnerships they have preferred
to “go it alone.” This week Mr. John
Valder, who spent 10 years 5 on the
“Sydney Morning Herald” before join-
ing the old-established brokerage firm
of J. and J. North seven years ago, has
left the partnership to set up shop on
his own: His move follows less than a
year after Mr. Ray Arthur (formerly a
partner in Sydney’s biggest broking
house, Ord Minnett T. J. Thompson
and Partners, before moving over for a
short spell in the family firm of Anschau
and Partners) went out on his own.
But these two are johnny-come-
lately’s compared with Mr. Gordon
Jackson, the finance editor first of
“Smith’s Weekly” and then, after its
closure, of the “Sunday Sun” before
becoming a broker 12 years ago. He has
been a sole trader for almost 10 years.
A few years after the “Sunday Sun”
had merged with the “Sunday Herald,”
Ray Arthur took over its finance page.
He had started off in finance journalism
on Jobsons not long after finishing his
accountancy course (as a CRTS student,
being a war-time RAAF observer) and
then moved to the “Australian Finan-
cial Review” early in the 19505.
John Valder is a 35-year-old former
Shore boy who did his Arts course at
Sydney University while working as a
cadet journalist on the “Herald.”
Unlike his two colleagues, he did not
work in the finance room, but spent
m’ost of his journalistic life away from
headquarters—either in the “Herald’s”
Canberra bureau (where he saved
enough money to “play the market” by
cycling to work) or in its New York
office, where he was sent for two years.
But readers of THE BULLETIN will
know his work best from the time he
spent several years ago as the specu-
lator whose diary appears each week.
JN Melbourne, where many more
journalists have made the move from
typewriter to Stock Exchange chair, all
prefer to remain in partnership than
express the individuality of their Sydney
brethren. Two of them, Mr. A. Mcß.
Fairfoul, former commercial editor of
the Melbourne “Herald,” and Mr. G.
Maggia, an ex-finance editor of the
“Age,” are members of the same firm
(Tolhurst, Henley, Monckton). One of
Mr. Maggia’s successors at the “Age,”
Mr. Roy Course, is now a member of
the Sydney Stock Exchange, but looks
after the Melbourne operations of his
firm, Patrick and Co. Mr. Howard Nan-
kervis, of Eric
Morgan and Co.,
is a former finance
journalist on the
Melbourne “Sun-
Pictorial,” and
Mr. Peter Jaffe, of
Wm. Noalls, spent
some years on the
“Australian Finan-
cial Review.”
But the most
successful former
journalist in the
broking business is
John Valder
Mr. Staniforth Ricketson, the senior
partner of J. B. Were and Co., wha
had a short spell as a journalist in his
teens before going into stockbroking in
1911, aged 20. He has always had
former newspapermen in his firm, but
only one, Mr. A. C. Traxton, who was
on the Sydney “Daily Telegraph” from
1920 to 1932, is a partner.
THE commanding figure of Sir
Charles Dunphie, chairman of
Vickers, flew into Australia for
the annual meeting of the Australian
subsidiary in Melbourne last week and
then headed to another of the group’s
overseas outposts in India. En passant,
he gave some reassuring nods on the-


well tell the States to follow Western Australia’s example. And
why not get the people to vote at the scheduled referendum
to delete the clause specifying excise as a sole Commonwealth
right. Such an initiative would have the political advantage
of suggesting that Canberra is sincere in wanting the States
to remain viable, and so erode the position of those who say
that the proposal to expand the Federal Parliament is simply
another manifestation of an insatiable desire for more power.
Some Sterling Friends?
FOREIGN influences could make their presence felt fairly
strongly in the stockmarket in coming months —and not
all of them need be bad. Apart from suggestions that
Britain’s move into the Common Market is losing momentum
(which could bring some benefits to companies that export
the sort of goods to Britain that would be certain to suffer
some tariff disability under the EEC), there is the chance
that the U.K. Government could well make some small
concessions in its April Budget on the severe restraints on
overseas investment—at least to sterling countries like Aus-
tralia. A bit of British capital coming here after April could
jog our stockmarket along a bit when it may need some
support. It would even be welcome if we could be certain
that the end had come of the huge selling of the past year.
But there have not even been hints that any such relaxa-
tion will happen; it simply seems an inexpensive way of
making friends with the Commonwealth. If the British
Government is eager to show that its European ambitions
do not mean the severing of links with the Commonwealth
(particularly those good reliable sterling area members),
then making a token gesture by slightly relaxing the offensive
restraints on investment to them seems good political sense.
It would go some of the way toward calming dbwn the
vocal anti-Common Market, pro-Commonwealth group
within the British Labour Party.
future of Britain and our economic
links with her. But he wasn’t telling
what plans were afoot for the expan-
sion of Vickers (Australia) Ltd., only
expressing hopes and, by inference
from his rundown of the group’s wide
diversification of interests (mostly
through takeover) elsewhere things
like commercial hydraulic equipment,
printing machinery, medical and office
accoutrements hinting perhaps that
Vickers might have something new in
store for industry here.
In stature Sir Charles fits a strong
man’s figure, as one might expect
from the head of Vickers (or, say
Krupps). The background, of course,
is solid Service training (Osborne,
Dartmouth and the RMA, Woolwich),
flowing on naturally to war service
and high officer ranking (Major-
General).
His services were then keenly sought
in the company world, not only by
Vickers (Dunphie’s last Army post
was Director-General of Armored
Fighting Vehicles, 1945-48, so he had
the right apprenticeship), but others
also, such as Westminster Bank and
Royal Exchange Assurance. Now 65,
he is soon to retire from Vickers. For
a while, however, he will keep on as
chairman of its subsidiary, English
Steel Corporation, which is scheduled
to be re-nationalised later this year.

THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The Federal Government’s
February loan, its first without any fixed target, brought
in a total $204m.; net of “unusually large” redemptions
and some conversion, the loan gives the Commonwealth
“substantially” more than sloom. new money. With an
April-May loan to come, the Government is still con-
siderably short of the Loan Council’s aim for 1966-67.
Most items of industrial production, including motor
vehicles, increased during the three months to January;
building materials, however, continue to lag . . . January’s
car registrations reached 33,500, 2000 under December’s,
yet the best January for quite a time.
Private house and flat approvals in January, at 7349,
comfortably exceeded the previous January’s 5933; non-
residential building, on the other hand, remains far from
buoyant . . . New capital spending by business for the
three months to December, $443.5m. was s6m. above
the September quarter.
For the markets: Going back by small doses
seems to be the fate of most industrial sections on
Australian sharemarkets. Minings and oils are under
much heavier scrutiny.
A reasonably fair start could not be held in London;
industrials look very mixed . . . Much the same posi-
tion prevails on Wall Street; steels and motors give
ground.
For companies: The reporting climate did not
lack for influence from some industrial heavyweights . . .
John Lysaght’s full 1966 year saw earnings up by 8
percent to $6,203,000 on slightly lower sales; an
excellent second half justifies directors’ forecast of a
better 1967 . . . Group profit of British Tobacco (Aust.)
went to a record $7,466,363, an 11 percent advance, the
board emphasising the success of cigarette activities; an
already announced higher 12 percent dividend is covered
by a 19.3 percent earning rate . . . Jam and fruit canner
Henry Jones is likely to make its cash issue later in
1967; some “small difficulties” don’t mean the group is
not “securely placed” . . . Keeping up the big retailers’
end (and a 12J percent dividend rate), Grace Bros,
mentioned a “satisfactory” turnover rise and “buoyant”
Christmas trading . . . Merchant and investor W. R.
Carpenter is earning “in line with budget” and gives
away nothing by expectations of a “satisfactory” year.
Pastoral interests do not display a uniform escape
from the drought . . . Tasmania’s A. G. Webster and
Woolgrowers won 29 percent more sales to December
and sedately announces a “higher” profit . . . Restocking
benefited Winchcombe, Carson in N.S.W. and Queens-
land, so the first half’s group profit gained 48 percent
despite lower wool handlings ... A shortage of livestock
going to market distressed meat processor F. J. Walker;
lower earnings did not cover the usual 6J percent interim
. . . Geelong woolbroker Dennys, Lascelles comes to light
with a two-for-five par issue ... In Adelaide* Bennett
and Fisher announces a first bonus issue, one-for-two, in
48 years of existence . . . The same city’s agricultural
equipment maker David Shearer found December earn-
ings soaring 59 percent to $154,655 . . . Bundaberg’s
sugar harvester maker Toft Bros, looks well on budget.
The financiers arrived in a cheerful stream, even
though Mutual Acceptance thought it better to cut
interim payment from to 6 percent when earning
rate on higher capital slipped from 18.9 to 17.2 percent;
the half-year’s profits actually went up 13.2 percent to
a record $577,640 . . . The E.S. and A. Bank’s Esanda
pushed December half’s earnings up 20.8 percent to
$1,153,353, showing a 46.1 percent annual earning rate
. . . Cambridge Credit achieved a steady half-year,
strengthening its earning rate to 15.6 percent (pre-
viously 15.5) . . . Lower tax aided Mercantile Credits,
on smaller volume, to lift profit 12.2 percent (to
$738,603) in the December period . . . The much-


damaged Deposit and Investment is
mending itself and is able to make
lower provision for earlier incurred
bad debts . . . On the insurance side,
Mercantile Mutual will suffer little
from the Tasmanian bushfires . . .
Australian General Insurance proposes
a one-for-four par issue, holding the
17-year-old 12J percent dividend; 1966
profits moved up 16 percent.
Appliance manufacturers could take
no cheer from General Industries
(Metters), whose 1966 earnings
dropped 20 percent to $802,957, albeit
on higher tax; the 6 percent dividend
prevails against a 9.5 percent earning
rate . . . Then along came Malleys
with record sales to December and a
“substantial” profit rise . . . Over the
same period metal fabricator and
merchant G. E. Crane earned 10 per-
cent less before tax . . . Tubular steel
expert Cyclone pushed up a half-year’s
earnings 17 percent to $720,000, well
rid of an unprofitable steel rolling sub-
sidiary . . . Newbold General Refrac-
tories has met lower turnover; “conse-
quently profit is also lower” . . .
Builders’ supplier PGH Industries is
improving a little, with a small sales
increase . . . Profits of timber mer-
chant Allen Taylor flopped by 25 per-
cent when sales dropped 2.8 percent;
the interim payment is intact.
“No tangible evidence of a fresh
demand for capital equipment”
appears in sight for Vickers Australia

The Mixture As Before?
By CROESUS
ADMITTEDLY the economic yeast
is rising, but even knowledgeable
forecasters, such as Dr. Hall in
the “Financial Review,” base their
optimism mainly on the revival of
spending, which this column drew at-
tion to months ago. What continues to
puzzle me is the part to be played in
the new economic mix by capital spend-
ing of businesses. If private sector in-
vestment is going to grasp the nettle
of expansion in the same spirited man-
ner predicted for personal spending,
then, with public investment at the
flood, we could be heading for a boom
battle in the pool of available capital
resources.
It is all very nice to have public
investment filling the gap created by
flagging private investment, as hap-
pened last year; but not capital spend-
ing by both sectors going flat out at
the same time, as has happened to the
economy’s cost before.
The image of the public sector steal-
ing the private sector’s investment
clothes has not faded all that much in
recent years, and won’t until the in-
vestment dice become less heavily
loaded in favor of the public sector’s
capital requirements. None the less, the
business world is now more tolerant
than it’s ever been to public invest-
ment. This is because its own welfare
has become more dependent on it, there
is a better realisation that an expanding
public sector base is the sine qua non
of its own growth and, well, it is pretty
helpless to contain the appetite of
governments for funds, anyway.
i'J'HE recent Federal-States finance
meetings in Canberra were not all
that much concerned with public in-
vestment, except in the sense that the
deficits of at least some States derive
as much from overspending previous
entitlements to capital as from revenue
funds a line getting more difficult
to draw now that social investment has
grown to dwarf practically all other
items in State Budgets. Of course, there
were also discussions and one agreement
to assist financing a natural gas pipeline
(South Australia), yet strictly speaking
the allocations of capital funds to the
States were not involved, nor was the
overall national public investment pro-
gram. For a revision of the latter, and
the accompanying carve-up of the
portion to be reserved to the States
when the Commonwealth has taken its
whack, we have to wait until the Loan
Council meets again in June.
This being so, the meetings passed
over the heads of the business world,
which was mainly looking for clues
on such vital matters as interest rates,
taxation, and pump priming. It found
none. The additional $l5 million “won”
by the States was of no more than
passing interest. It is a meagre marginal
amount measured against the States’ or
total public authority spending. Also it
merely shifts to the Federal deficit what
would have had to be financed by the
States from trust funds and their own
credit sources, so its net pump priming
effect will be negligible.
This result of the bargaining accords
with the views of Staniforth Ricketson,
whose verdict in Melbourne last week
was that, if there was a time when
additional official action to stimulate
the economy was necessary, “it appears
fairly certain that that time had now
passed,” that is, he added, “always
providing the Government avoids
actions and attitudes which would hin-
der the strengthening of business con-
fidence.” In a word, Mr. Ricketson
thinks that although the economy is
“still functioning at less than an ac-
ceptable overall level of activity,” it
is heading in the right direction and
excessive caution on the part of the
authorities might crab the improvement.
QUOTING from the Reserve Bank’s
December Statistical Bulletin on
the point (has he, by the way, made it
up with Dr. Coombs at long last?), it
seems also that the weakening of private
capital inflow could be worrying Mr.
Ricketson, holding him back, perhaps,
from an unbridled prophecy. Reading
between the lines, the implication could
be that, if for no other reason, by
reducing the supply of longish-term
capital funds, a continuance of the
decline in capital inflow would auto-
matically restrict the scope of the much
needed revival in fixed private invest-
ment in industry (in the latest Decem-
ber half-year, new capital expenditure
by private business was only sB33m.
compared with $9l lm. in the like
period, 1965).
Even so, it would be reasonable to
expect that, despite the falling off of
capital inflow, fixed private investment
will pick up in response to resurgent
business confidence and the currently
evident upward trend of industrial out-
put in a snowballing movement. In
that case, by the time the next Federal-
States finance meetings come around in
June, fixed private investment could
conceivably be more than holding its
own in the national investment equa-
tion, so reversing the situation which
has persisted for the past year or more
when only a heavy make-weight of capi-
tal (as well as other) expenditure by
the public sector saved the economy
from going into a deeper decline, some-
thing the business world had good
reason to be thankful for.
If this happens in the next four
months and by June the economy is as
buoyant as, say, Dr. Hall of the National
University thinks it will be, economic
policy could well be demanding a
tightening up on the public investment

a business!
Here was a company going places. Up to the minute on the market, knew what their
competitors were doing, continually checking with surveys, research and statistics.
Trouble was, they ignored the most vital statistics of all . . . that major fires put up
to 71% of companies out of business. We tried to point out all these vital points, but
were met with the “Won’t Happen To Me” attitude. Finally the discussion was closed
with a polite yawn of boredom. It happened! They paid the high price . . . loss of
wages, turnover, key staff and customers of years standing. Insurance covered the
physical things . . . but it wasn’t enough! Statistics also show that fires can be
beaten. In fact major fires can be eliminated or drastically reduced. EVERY 24 HOURS

front. Its severity would depend on the
broad principle that an excess of overall
national investment in relation to avail-
able capital supplies would create in-
flationary pressures. For my part I’m
not looking for a revival in fixed pri-
vate investment of sufficient strength to
create an overall excess as soon as
June.
I would think that the current revival
of private spending would take much
longer to work its way through to in-
dustrialists’ expectations on the mar-
ginal efficiency of new capital expen-
diture, especially given the distinct
possibility of long-term capital being
in shorter supply because of reduced
capital inflow. I would also like to
see the revival of spending and in-
dustrial output (clearly evident from
the statistics in recent months) go
rather further before hazarding a pre-
diction on the likely trend in fixed
capital spending by industry (particu-
uarly manufacturing industry). Most
industrialists would probably prefer to
see capital spending by governments at
least held at present levels for the time
being, and could well be thinking the
same way in four months’ time.
QN the other hand it has to be remem-
bered that public works spend-
ing allocations for the whole of 1967-
68 will be fixed by the Loan Council
that month and also that it is notor-
iously difficult for either the States or
the Commonwealth to cut back their
programs in mid-stream, as might be
demanded by economic policy some-
time in the course of next year.
To my way of thinking it would be
deplorable if, for want of sufficient
foresight or from dissatisfaction at last
year’s slower tempo and lack of excite-
ment in the economy, we allowed it
to plunge headlong into a situation in
which the private sector had pulled out
all its spending and investment stops
and the public sector was running
heavy deficits and allowing its capital
spending full rein. We’ve been in that
situation before, most markedly in 1951
and 1960, and we’ve been sternly
brought to heel each time. I’m not
convinced, as yet, by those who see
the economy coming to the boil in such
a short time, but if they are right then
the authorities would be well advised
to start exercising more restraint.

Good Augury from Lysaght
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
THE interims still look good and the
market is still going down. Lately
there have been more examples of
lower profits, but these seemed to be
in line with known conditions in the
industries concerned during the De-
cember half year. And in any event,
most of these should do better in the
second half.
For example, the tougher times for
the Peters companies around Australia
was hardly unexpected in view of the
mess that British Tobacco has made
of the ice-cream industry with its
vigorous merchandising of the bulk
variety (also, by the way, providing a
soft spot in its own diversifications in
a year in which tobacco carried the
company to a 9 percent profit rise
despite difficulties in several non-
tobacco interests). But the really im-
pressive thing about last week’s in-
terims was the widespread improve-
ment from companies as different as
Penfolds and Bonds, S.A. Rubber (a
good result in the circumstances of the
tyre war) and Winchcombe, Carson (re-
flecting the post-drought pick-up).
Probably the most significant, how-
ever, was the Lysaght result for the
year, as the company recovered suf-
ficiently from the first half setback
(when profits fell $l.l million) to lift
earnings for the 12 months to De-
cember by $273,000. Apart from the
13 percent sales increase in the second
half of the year over the first half, it
appears that improved internal
efficiency has played a major part in
the Lysaght recovery. For even though
Lysaght has been able to force the
end of some of the “dumping” com-
petition it faced, it still is in the un-
comfortable position of being squeezed
between the steel maker (who supplies
its raw material and whose prices go
up now and again) and the importer of
competitive products to Lysaght’s, who
has in the past been all too able to
offer lower prices.
Lysaght’s improved internal efficiency
(and it was certainly needed) has re-
duced the scope for fair-priced com-
petitive imports, and its “watchdog”
activities on dumping (it is under-
stood to have had a success with one
U.S. car maker which was importing
large quantities of sheet at unreal
prices) are helping ensure that it does
not lose markets to foreign dumping.
But the striking thing is that if
Lysaght’s can do better in a period
when motor-car production is down,
when General Industries reports that
conditions are tough in appliances (and
demonstrates it with a 10 percent profit
fall) and when other company directors
talk of “a degree of recession” in 1966,
Lysaght’s future seems quite good. In
addition, new products like the pre-
painted strip now being produced at
Port Kembla should help things along.
(Incidentally, the Brownbuilt pre-
painted strip line seems to have come
up against some delivery delays from
its U.K. suppliers and is not yet in
operation; Hunter Douglas has its own
small line working well, but mainly on
aluminium strip, much of which is
used in its own Venetian blind business).
NOT all the meat companies should
be tarred with the same brush the
market has used on F. J. Walker
Ltd. following last week’s announce-
ment that half-year profits were not
enough to cover steady 6J percent
interim dividend. This news was an
unexpected development for Walkers,
whose chairman had confidently stated
last October that profits for the first
three months of the current year were
up and that he hoped to present a
satisfactory set of accounts for 1966-67.
Last year, Walkers managed a 27
percent profit rise when all the other
meat companies were looking a bit
down in the mouth and it was clearly
a once-and-for-all boost as drought-
striken Hunter Valley farmers killed off
their stock rather than have them die
on the farms. It was inevitable that
farmers would restock when the rains
came and that beasts would be in short
supply and very expensive. Most other
meat companies had already been
priced on this basis.
Walkers apparently expect second
half earnings to recover, otherwise they
would not have paid the steady in-
terim dividend. But it still looks very
shaky indeed. There seem to be better
stocks in this industry (particularly
those with large Queensland interests)
for those investors aware of the long-
term benefits to come as world meat
demand expands at a rapid rate.
THE market was unimpressed about
Grace Bros.’ news of a “satisfac-
tory increase” in turnover and
profit for the first half of the current
year; it still seems to need assurance
The Chartist says:
McDONALD INDUSTRIES is a stock which could show substantial capital
gains for investors prepared to buy near the base level. The chart, reproduced
back to 1960, shows a top formation with a high point of $1.92 and a
break in trend early in 1962 about the $1.60 level. The decline accelerated about
the beginning of 1964 and a low point of 30c was achieved in July, 1965. Once
again prices retreated to this level after rising to 52c during the early months of
1966. Although the stock is basically still in a major downtrend, the present
base pattern could justify recommendation above the 40c level. It is showing
above average market strength and the potential of a short-term move to
approximately 70c exists; the overall bearishness of the market at present suggests
that prices would be more likely to retreat close to the 40c level during the next
few weeks. The present base suggests that McDonald Industries could eventually
rise close to $1.20 for the longer term. Last sale price on 24/2/67 —50c.

A member of the

on several points not dealt with in
last week’s interim statement. It
wanted to know whether the profit rise
was enough to provide a higher earn-
ing rate on the increased average
capital; whether the “improved trad-
ing” at Roselands also meant higher
profits; whether the lack of a fore-
cast of increased earnings for the full
year meant that the company was un-
certain of the outcome, and whether
British shareholders had ceased the
selling that has had such a depVessing
impact on the stock in recent times.
The last question was not up to
the directors to answer and it does
appear that remaining British holders
are more likely to stick with their
shares. But the other questions, which
could have been settled by the board,
seem very likely to be resolved to
shareholders’ advantage (and to the
advantage of investors who acquire
these shares at current prices of $1.60
or less). The Chartist takes the view
that these shares could be bought
cheaper in coming months, so there may
be no need to rush in, even though the
shares could rise above the $1.70 mark
by the end of the year.
Earning rate seems to have improved,
Roselands is earning larger profits,
there is evidence that consumer spend-
ing is picking up (and that the com-
pany is even managing to make some
profit on its electric durable goods
despite the continued existence of H. G.
Palmers, and the Myer cut-price policy),
and the prospects appear to be for
a higher earning rate for the full year
(after all, the period to January covers
the company’s two peak-selling periods).
What this stock really needs to kick
it back up near the $2 mark again
is a return to the high overtime earn-
ings of three years ago. The lack of
overtime over the past two years has
been the major cause of the slack in
the retail trade.
SOME time ago the heavy depen-
dence of Berlei United on its
British subsidiary for its profits
was pointed out here; so Berlei could
be one company that may be finding
things fairly difficult because of the
British economic squeeze. Recently the
company reported slightly lower net
profit for the December half-year,
which it said was due to a fall in U.K.
profits despite record sales there, and
there seems every chance that Britain
could remain a hard market (especially
as the “squeeze” has coincided with
some energetic efforts by rivals to win
larger slices of the foundation garment
market). This means that Berlei must
try harder to build up returns from
its Australian operations, where its
recent record has not been inspiring.
The recent interim said that Aus-
tralian earnings were “about the same”
as the previous year, which is a little
disappointing. Berlei appears to have
suffered from some uncertainty in its
selling and advertising approach; it has
employed three different advertising
agents in the past three years.

behind the balance sheets
Overseas for the Downswing
IDEAL stocks to buy in market
downturns are those whose share
prices have fallen in sympathy with
the trend, but whose earning rates and
dividends keep going up and give
every indication of continuing to do
so. Overseas Corporation (Australia)
Ltd. is such a company. It has an im-
pressive record, is in a growth industry,
and has powerful friends.
But the market has marked the com-
pany’s share price down to $1.28 since
its buoyant interim report and higher
interim dividend (the 6 percent pay-
ment at least guarantees last year’s
12 percent annual rate). The 50 cent
shares are now 12 cents lower than at
the beginning of the year and there
is a 3 cent dividend included in the
price. Yet the “substantially increased”
profits and higher earning rate in the
December half-year were earned with-
out the benefit of any income from
the group’s $1.65 million investment in
what is potentially its fastest-growing
interest its joint ownership with
Alcoa of the aluminium semi-fabricator
and building products maker, Dowell
Australia Ltd., to which Overseas sold
its own aluminium building material
operations, including an extrusion plant,
in exchange for the 50 percent share
interest at the end of the last financial
year. So the latest profit jump was also
despite the departure of this $1.65 mil-
lion worth of plant.
Trading in the December half of
1965-66, with which current results are
compared, was 17 percent up on the
December half of 1964-65. Results for
the full year to June, 1966 (which gave
a 22.4 percent earning rate), were 30
percent better than the previous period,
so that the latest trading news reflects a
gathering momentum.
F and when, Dowell gets back to
paying dividends, they should pro-
vide a healthy addition to Overseas’
earnings; a return to Dowell’s old 11
percent rate would add $lBO,OOO to
Overseas’ investment income (and rep-
resent a 20 percent lift to last year’s net
profit). But apart from saying that for
the December half-year Dowell’s opera-
tions were “at a satisfactory level of
profitability,” so far there has been no
hint of its future dividend policy.
Alcoa’s main aspirations for Dowell
would presumably be to push up its
consumption of Alcoa’s aluminium as
fast as possible, so that it may prefer to
retain any profits for expansion. But
there also seems every chance that
Alcoa would welcome early dividends
from Dowell, if only to placate
some of its impatient local share-
holders, In any event, Overseas’
present chairman, Mr. G. A. Davis,
formerly also its managing director, is
now managing director of Dowell, indi-
cating that Overseas has a solid grip
on the Dowell situation.
Dowell is nevertheless moving smartly
to expand its production facilities all
round Australia; it is establishing new'
facilities for the production of alumin-
ium windows and other building pro-
ducts in Kilkenny (Adelaide); has
taken over a new' factory at Eagle
Farm (Brisbane); has bought land on
the border of A.C.T., and has purchased
J. Connolly (W.A.), doubling its fac-
tory space at Belmont. Dowell’s issued
capital trebled from $l.l lm. to $3.3m.
during 1966. If Dowell keeps up its
recent growth rate, Overseas could end
up with the tail wagging the dog, de-
riving more profit from its associate
interest than from its own activities.
But that seems a long way off.
In any event, increased returns from
Overseas’ other products offset this
loss of business that resulted from the
sale of its aluminium building mater-
ials activies whose importance in Over-
seas’ has not been revealed, but it was
less than half its total aluminium bus-
iness.
Overseas’ links w'ith Alcoa through
Dowell will bring technical benefits to
Overseas—as well as allowing Alcoa to
avoid the undesirable position of Alcoa
going into direct competition with its
own customers. Prior to the Alcoa-
Dowell arrangement, which became
effective on the first day of the cur-
rent financial year, Overseas w'as a
large manufacturer of its own mater-
ials. The aluminium extrusion plant at
Caringbah, wire-drawing and weaving
plant at Adelaide, and the architectural
metal fabricating and anodising plant at
Braybrook (Vic.) have gone to Dowell,
which is a fully integrated organisation.
Overseas’ retained its tube mill, sup-
plying the basic material for the tubu-
lar furniture (and outside customers),
and has a urethane foam plant at
Huntingdale (Vic.) and polyvinyl
chloride production facilities at Bel-
more (NSW).
Apart from the Dowell investment,
Overseas has a mixed bag of interests,
ranging from chartering out a heli-
copter and importing aircraft compon-
ents to an associate interest in the
supply of Downyfiake prepared food
mixes and the running of Downyfiake
shops. Most of them are long standing,
and not so unrelated as appears at
first glance. Some have developed from
merchandising of imported goods to
the manufacture of those products by
Overseas itself. The business as it now
remains covers the manufacture of
hollow-ware and kitchenware, largely
of aluminium but some stainless steel,
and mainly sold under the Namco
label; manufacture of Namco alumin-
ium and steel furniture for outdoors,
domestic, and institutional use; manur
facture of Bon Voyage travel goods,
and the production of tar coatings for
tar enamels used in coating oil, gas
and water pipeline. (The latter was
established in Newcastle close to BHP,
which supplies the base tar material,
late in 1965.) Overseas also has a
large merchandising division for im-
ported yarns and fibres and giftware.
There are also associate interests in
Namco (N.Z.) Ltd. and in Asia.
Kwong Hin (Malaysia) Ltd. of Sin-
gapore and Khinco Ltd. of Kuala
Lumpur are metal fabricators (50
percent owned) and Diesel Electric
(Malaya) Ltd., handling Bosch equip-
ment, is 25 percent owned.
'J'HE PVC sheeting and coating busi-
ness came by way of the takeover of
Plastic Coatings late in 1965. Overseas
explained at the time that this com-
pany was one of only four Australian
producers of PVC material of a type
used in large quantities by the group,
and that control of production of major
components was essential to Overseas
if the sources of supply were unduly
limited. (Overseas now has assured
sources of supply for both its major-
materials aluminium and PVC.)
Plastic Coatings lost $52,000 in 1964-65,
and about $282,000 in 1965-66 after
extensive write-offs, including $223,998
obsolete stock write-off, and probably
accounts for the greater part of the
$373,818 which Overseas group
accounts show as pre-acquisition
losses. High emergency tariff duties
on imported PVC materials were re-
imposed in July, 1966, so that Plastic
Coatings’ capacity for profit-making is
now enhanced, at least temporarily.
These losses carried forward should
provide some tax benefits in future
years. The tax savings in 1965-66, at
$42,000, were relatively insignificant.
Only in 1962-63 and 1964-65 did there
seem to be much lightening of the tax
burden through pre-acquisition losses
and investment allowances.
Overseas’ cross-investment in Mid-
land Aluminium Ltd. of England, ar-
ranged in 1964, whereby each would
hold about 9 percent of the other’s
capital, was liquidated at the beginning
of August, 1966, because of the pres-
sure on sterling, although technical
links remain. The price of $717,040
received for its Midland holding a
month after balance date was $130,085
short of the market value quoted for
the end of the financial year, as a
parcel of 375,000 shares had to be
placed at some discount on a sharply
falling market. The capital profit of
$154,540 on sale of this investment will
boost reserves in 1967 accounts. In
1965, capital profits of similar magni-
tude ($150,090) were recorded from the
sale of freehold land and investments.
The 1966 accounts show an addi-
tional slm. investment in fixed assets
and $1.15m. in current assets (before
the Dowell deal), financed by the bank
and trade creditors, from retained
profits and the one-for-four issue at


Prosperity
is no
accident
m
m Living standards in this country are almost without
equal anywhere in the world. But this prosperity is no
accident it is born of our healthy competitive way of
life. Our competitive banking system, for example, pro-
vides a vital force in Australia’s progress.
RANKS KEEP US MOVING AHEAD!

Australia’s competing banks provide a range of banking
services that not only help maintain the pace of develop-
ment in Australia, but provide a stimulus wherever people
with initiative demonstrate that they have a contribution
to make to Australia’s progress.
Australia’s prosperity is the result of the enterprise of
people and their banks.

30c premium of June, 1965. The final
call of 40c, including 15c premium,
was payable in July, 1966, so that the
company was $744,373 richer in cash
shortly after the last accounts were
drawn up. (Paid capital then became
$5,178,541, including $435,000 in prefs.)
The company has borowings of only
$355,175, besides the $239,210 in notes,
which convert on 1968 balance date
into ordinary shares. The proceeds from
liquidating the Midland investment
have placed Overseas in a very flush
position, but this liquidity could easily
be soaked up by Dowell’s rapid ex-
pansion program.
Overseas is a very interesting pro-
position for capital appreciation in the
medium term. At $1.28 the 50c stock
affords a moderate income return of
4.7 percent and earnings yield of 9.1
percent.

MINING
Very Rational
Takeover
VERY few takeovers are as rational
as the pending acquisition of
Wyong Minerals by Associated
Minerals. Most of Wyong Minerals’
rutile and zircon production is sold to
Associated Minerals and the two com-
panies use the same type of equipment
to mine identical products. In effect,
Wyong Minerals has been an opera-
tional subsidiary of Associated Minerals
since 1963, when the first contract be-
gan, under which Wyong has been sell-
ing most of its production to Associated
Minerals at below market prices.
While these reasons for integration
are obvious enough, they have been in
existence for some years. Perhaps a
more compelling reason for the merger
at this juncture is to be found in the
situation in regard to Wyong’s leases
at Tuggerah, on the northern side of
The Entrance. The leases it holds in
this area are comparable in size to
those at Munmorah, a few miles further
north, on which it is presently using
two dredges. Rapid development in the
Tuggerah area has been a matter of
some concern to Wyong and in October
last year the chairman said that “it
must be accepted that the area could
not be held indefinitely, to the detri-
ment of other forms of development.”
Pressure is also believed to have been
exerted by conservationist bodies to
prevent the mining of some areas of
these Tuggerah Lake leases. These
circumstances appear to indicate that


the company runs a high risk of for-
feiting at least part of these leases if
it does not commence mining operations
fairly soon, and technical studies to-
ward this end began last October.
A dredge would cost in the vicinity
of $500,000 to $600,000, but as the
company’s present dry plant is running
at near capacity levels, expenditure re-
quired to exploit these Tuggerah
leases could easily exceed this figure.
At June 30, 1966, Wyong appeared to
have around $362,000 of current assets
in excess of current liabilities, rather
less than would be needed for this ex-
penditure. Associated Minerals, on the
other hand, had at balance date last year
over slm. more in current assets than
current liabilities. In addition to this,
Associated Minerals last year commis-
sioned extensive new facilities at Hex-
ham, near Newcastle. Wyong Minerals
currently trucks its production to the
Associated Minerals stores at New-
castle, so an expansion of the Hexham
plant would no doubt be a more eco-
nomic method of treating the output
from a third dredge at Tuggerah than
would a small independent dry plant.
The actual merger will involve the
issue of slightly more than 1.5 million
Associated Minerals shares and will
bring Associated Minerals’ capital to
4,559,146 50 cent shares. Associated
Minerals is expected to earn close to
slm. this year, while, using Wyong’s
1966 profit as a guide, the combined
companies should earn at least sl.4m.
equivalent to 31 cents per share on
Associated Minerals’ increased capital.
At a price of $6.40, earnings of 31 cents
would yield 4.8 percent, which is the
current yield provided by Wyong Min-
erals’ 1966 earnings. The present earn-
ings yield of 4.0 percent shown by
Associated Minerals on last year’s profit
would be reached at $7.60.
LATEST reports on Western Min-
ing Corporation’s nickel deposit
at Kambalda provide the basis
for some interesting figures. Reserves
so far have been proved to contain 2.3
million tons of 4.34 percent nickel ore,
and operations, which are expected to
begin in the middle of this year, will
reach a throughput of 500 tons per day
by the end of the year. At this rate
the mine will be producing around
250,000 tons of ore per year and have
a life of about ten years on established
reserves. This production rate is more
than double the 100,000 tons per annum
operation envisaged a year ago and
estimates of profit must be upgraded
accordingly.
Annual revenue could now be in
excess of sBm. while costs of mining
and treatment, etc., are likely to be in
the vicinity of $3.m., leaving ssm., out
of which the company will have to pay
tax and depreciation. The mining of
nickel provides a 20 percent exemption
from tax, so the effective rate of tax
will be 34 percent while allowances for
capital expenditure may provide other
taxation concessions in initial years.
Overall net profit is likely to be in
the region of s4m.
SECURITY ANALYSIS
Olympic's Pessimistic Price
OLYMPIC CONSOLIDATED IN-
DUSTRIES LIMITED will prob-
ably announce its half-yearly pro-
fit about the time that this article is
published. Last year, the announcement
was made on March 7 and, although
the actual figures were not given, it
was stated that group profits were down
by approximately 20 percent. The profit
for the whole financial year was down
by about 15 percent, suggesting that
some recovery occurred in the second
half. If Olympic follows Dunlop’s pat-
tern, this improvement can be expected
to continue into the first half of 1966-67.
The statistics are:

The most remarkable thing about
these statistics is that every ratio seems
to be exhibiting a downtrend with the
exception of net tangible assets per
share, which have increased steadily
throughout the period. It is, perhaps,
significant that in the last chairman’s
review of operations, covering the
period to June 30, 1966, reference is
made to the group’s “considerable ex-
pansion” in terms of assets and stock-
holders’ funds. The former (total tan-
gible assets) increased from $27.24 mil-
lion in 1956 to $61.78 million in 1966
and the latter increased from $18,176
million to $38,179 million during the
same period. On a straight line basis,
the annual rate of growth of total tan-
gible assets was about percent com-
pound and of stockholders’ funds about
7.7 percent.
F we looked at earnings over this
period, we would be rather disap-
pointed, for, if my records are correct,
earnings in 1956 were $2,128,000 and
they were only $2,590,000 in 1966. The
annual rate of growth on a straight line
basis here would be only 2 percent com-
pound. The growth in net profit, before
tax, depreciation, and interest on long-
term debt is, however, much more sig-
nificant and amounts to 4.2 percent per
annum compound on the same basis.
But, if we take the period from 1956
to 1963, this rate of growth would be
about 8-| percent that is, the same
rate of growth as. for total tangible
assets.
The Beaurepaire Tyre Service dates
back to 1922, according to a publication
issued by the company in September,
1964, entitled “Olympic A Great
Australian Industrial Enterprise.”
Olympic Tyre and Rubber Co. Pty.
Ltd., was formed in August, 1933, and
produced its first tyre in February,
1934. It was so successful that a profit
was made in the first financial year to
June 30, 1934, after operating for only
five months.
Cable making was commenced in
1940, but the company, Olympic Cables
Pty. Ltd., was not incorporated until
December, 1946. Other products, such
as rubber sheeting, hose, and flooring,
were also produced from late 1940 on-
ward and since the formation of
Olympic General Products Pty. Ltd.,
in July 1959, the range has been ex-
tended to cover insulation materials of
many kinds. Flooring materials, con-
veyor belting, footwear soling materials,
plastic extrusions and many other pro-
ducts are also manufactured.
r is, perhaps, significant that
Olympic had to meet very intense
competition from the time that the
Olympic Tyre and Rubber Co. was
formed. In the same history, the fol-
lowing paragraph appears:
“The early success of Olympic was
achieved in the face of strong compe-
tition from the established tyre com-
panies associated with world-wide
manufacturing corporations. These
organisations cut retail prices heavily
and, within a few months of the
arrival of Olympic tyres, the retail
price had been reduced by some 25
percent.”
Over the past six or seven years, we
have seen, three important new entrants
into the Australian tyre manufacturing
scene, namely B. F. Goodrich, U.S.
Rubber and, very recently, Firestone.
Furthermore, it appears that some over-
seas producers have managed to sell
their products into Australia despite
the tariff protection previously pro-
vided. The established tyre companies,
on this occasion, included Olympic. I
have not as yet seen any major re-
duction in the retail price of tyres,
although I am led to believe that
“special discounts” have become much
more common.
Information on products mix is not
readily available and one obtains it in
a fairly secretive fashion. Often it is
probably very far out but, in the case of
Olympic, I think that it is most likely
that the production of tyres and the
Beaurepaire Tyre Service account for
about 70 percent of total sales. The
distribution between cables and general
products is too difficult to guess at; in
any event, there is a fair chance that
the 70 percent group probably deter-
mines the profit trend for the group as
a whole.
It is equally likely that the new
vehicles registered are a greater factor
than the number of vehicles on register
because, even though the profit in origi-
nal equipment may be much less than

the profit in replacement and retreads,
there are five new tyres to each new
vehicle; after that probably less than
tyres are purchased per annum per
vehicle and about the same number re-
treaded.
The trend in new-vehicle registrations
has been rather gloomy since about
- July, 1965, until the December quarter
of 1966. Prior to that there had
been a fairly steady upwards trend,
which we must assume attracted the
latest two U.S.A. companies to the
Australian scene.
It will be interesting to compare the
indexes of new-vehicle registrations and
Olympic’s consolidated profit from
trading (before tax, depreciation, inter-
est on long-term debt, and other pro-
visions):
1961 - 100
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
New vehicle registra-
tions 94 121 138 145 132
Profit from trading 116 116 110 118 102
The index of earnings per share over
the same period shows an even sharper
decline in the 1965-66 year but, as a
result of an increase in the dividend
rate from 9 to 10 percent in 1961-62
and a one-for-seven rights issue at a
fifty percent premium in 1964-65, divi-
dends per share have shown an upward
trend as follows:
1961 » 100
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Per share:
Earnings 155 120 103 106 75
Dividends 113 113 113 114 118
It is fairly clear that these compari-
sons will not help very much in predict-
ing the future trends in either earnings
or dividends.
The issue of $8 million unsecured
notes made last September to finance
further expansion of the group will
add about $511,000 to the interest bill.
This would seem to indicate that an
increase of about 12 percent is neces-
sary in consolidated net profit before
tax merely to maintain the 1965-66
earnings per share. Of course, a full
year’s interest will not be payable in
1966- on this latest borrowing, so
the full effect will not be felt until
1967-
Provided that the improvement in
new-vehicle registrations continues,
Olympic should show some recovery in
earnings in 1966-67. Whether per share
earnings will reach the levels of 1962-65
is difficult to say. The current price of
around 70 cents seems to take too pessi-
mistic a view of the future and a price
of between 80 cents and 90 cents would
seem more realistic.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Once again the markets produced scattered evidence of an
end-of-week pick-up, yet this was clearly insufficient to counter
the general drift; practically all index sections are still falling
back. Not even BHP could manage to hold some early advance:
it finished a net 6 cents down at $6.30. John Lysaght’s hopeful
report eventually meant a shedding of 1 cent to $2.55. British
Tobacco naturally found favor, adding 15 cents to reach $2.52,
while Henry Jones (up 16 cents) and Rothmans (up 8 cents)
reversed previous tendencies. Miners and oils aren’t happy.
CMI, for instance, plunged 40 cents to $2.30.

A Broker's Slant on Dunlop
By PELIAS in Melbourne
lAN POTTER & CO. must have a
fairly good idea of what is going
on at Dunlop Rubber and what
is in store for the group; the firm was
an underwriter to the 1963 par and
bonus issues, the 1964 par issue and
the 1966 unsecured note issue. The
relationship between the two seems to
go a little deeper than underwriter and
client, so it may be wise to sit up and
take notice when this broking firm
recommends Dunlop shares. In its
latest fornightly review of the share
market it has pointed out that Dunlop
seems due for a period of growth and
left it to clients to judge whether the
shares are worth buying or not.
Obviously they are. It has already
been reported that profits were up 26
percent in the first half of the current
year; in the previous corresponding
period they had dropped 23 percent
and in the full 1965-66 year they fell
31 percent. On present indications, the
company could more than recover all
this lost ground in the current year.
Such an achievement would be little
short of phenomenal. Nevertheless, it
is within the group’s reach, mainly be-
cause certain plans which were under-
taken some time ago are at last part-
ing to bear tangible fruit.
F a nutshell, these plans embraced
the expansion and modernisation of
production facilities and the rationalis-
ing of warehousing and distribution
methods. The program started in 1964-
65 after an assessment was made of the
various potential markets available to
the company over the next ten years.
The assessment showed a need to in-
crease the production of some products
by as much as 100 percent. The 1964
par issue provided the initial finance
for these the recent unsecured
note issue was also made to help meet
the bill. The benefits are starting to
accrue.
But this is not the only reason why
the shares appear worth buying. For a
start, the immediate future of the tyre
industry looks a little better than its
past two years have been. The 5£
percent increase in the price of replace-
ment tyres last August has helped mat-
ters and will continue to do so. Much
more important, however, is the out-
come of the Tariff Board inquiry into
the dumping of tyres from overseas.
Potter’s circular says this could lead
to action against imports and, with the
connections the firm has, it is better
placed than any other outsider to
venture an opinion on the inquiry’s
likely outcome.
The granting of protection would
provide the local industry with the
greatest boost it has seen in years.
Although competition from local manu-
facturers is, and will continue to be,
severe, the removal of the present large
Japanese imports (that have concen-
trated on the more profitable high
volume lines) could leave something
like 10 percent of the replacement
market open once again to local manu-
facturers. Dunlop would probably gain
a fair share of the recovered market;
price would not enter into it as the
local manufacturers sell, even in the
present tough times, at uniform prices.
The company is just as likely to see
similar gains from its non-tyre activities.
These are growing in importance,
especially now that the Western Aus-
tralian and South Australian plants
jointly owned with Olympic have been
closed. The group’s other activities are
many and varied and, on the surface at
least, are profitable diversifications.
The company’s growth away from tyres
is picking up apace of late; it has
started acquiring smaller firms, whereas
before the diversification was more
limited to adding to the product range
from its own plants. Two recent acqui-
sitions have been the Paramount Shirt
Co. Pty. Ltd. and a 47 percent interest
in the expanding Frank O’Neill In-
dustries Ltd., the swimming - pool
builder and concrete specialist.
So Dunlop’s outlook is good enough
for investors to give serious thought to
the broker’s recommendation of the
shares at $1.41, where they yield a good
return of about 5J percent after broker-
age. It could well be that a decent rise
in earnings will warrant a return to 10
percent dividends in the current year
or, more probably, in 1967-68. The
payout was cut to 8 percent in 1964-
65 after earning rate had dipped from
15.9 to 13.2 percent on the higher
capital. Last year there was a further
slip to 8.2 percent. If the earnings do
recover to around the 15 percent mark
without an increase in . dividend, then
it will be possible that directors are
contemplating another issue to finance
their obviously well-thought-out plans
for the group. Whatever happens, a
medium to long term rise in the share
price seems a sure thing.
THE paint and protective coatings
industry is pretty cut-throat at
the moment but, with the
recovery in the automotive and housing
fields, Taubmans’ 50-cent shares would
seem well worth a gamble at $1.05,
where they yield 7.8 percent from last
year’s narrowly covered 16 percent
dividend. Earning rate in the year to
September 30 last was steady at 18.6
percent, thanks mainly to a sizeable
improvement in results from the group’s
New Zealand interests. The increases
which the whole group could score in
the current year should extend the
dividend cover and encourage a higher
market price for the shares.
Apart from the recovery in the
industries which it serves, there are
other reasons for expecting an improve-
ment. Certain expansion was under-
taken in 1965-66 which will stand the
company in good stead for getting an
increased share of the market this
year. Extensions were made in the
productive capacity at several centres,
new plant was introduced in some
cases, a Sydney distributing organisa-
tion was acquired, and Victorian
operations reorganised for a substantial
saving on operating costs. Improved
trading has already been reported for
the current year, the printing ink
division has started making profits and
N.Z. operations are expected to do as
well as last year, despite the country’s
economic problems..
All the signs are there for a higher
profit and a rise in the market’s esti-
mation of the stock. However, because
of the severe competition and the un-
foreseeable ups and downs in the
industry, the stock is only one for
speculators.
COMMODITIES
Placer's Gain from Endako
PLACER DEVELOPMENT’S
molybdenum-producing subsidiary
Endako Mines, which has been
operating for about 18 months, faces a
relatively good market this year. End-
ako appears to be the dominant factor
in Placer’s profits at present. It raised
prices by 7 U.S. cents to $U.5.1.62 a
lb. last month, following the lead of
the main world supplier, Climax (an
Amax subsidiary).
Molybdenum production last year ex-
ceeded consumption of 113 million lb.
by 7 million lb., and stockpile releases
and Russian sales brought the surplus
to 18 million lb. This represented an
improvement from the tight supply
position of the previous five years.
This year, Climax has forecast a
further lift in the surplus, but this fore-
cast may be pessimistic. The U.S. re-
leases will be much less, while con-
sumption should be aided by the better
supply picture.
In the eight months to
Placer earned net profit of sCan.
6,408,000. This was after providing
$1,602,000 for the 23.4 percent outside
holders’ interest in Endako, indicating
the size of the subsidiary’s contribution
to group profit.
AMONG those who see a weaker
trend in copper prices this year
is the vice-president of American
Smelting and Refining. Mr. Simon D.
Strauss said recently: “We expect
copper prices to be well maintained

during the first half (of 1967) and
until the labor picture in the U.S. is
resolved. If there is no serious inter-
ruption in domestic mine production,
prices for scrap and dealer copper
could weaken in the second half “if
inventories are run down.”
Mr. Strauss points out that world
production capacity rose 5 percent in
1966 although output was no greater
than in 1965. He forecasts another 5
percent rise in capacity this year.
At the same time, he points out,
copper is losing some traditional mar-
kets because of high prices and supply
uncertainty. He emphasises that there
is no chance of a surplus in the near
future, especially ahead of the mid-
year wage contract negotiations. Any
lengthy production halt at that time
would be a blow to U.S. consumers.
Meanwhile, the London Metal Ex-
change was only briefly affected last
week and the week before by a squeeze
in spot supplies. The shortage was
caused by maturity of three-months
contracts negotiated in November.
After jumping to more than
£stg.46o at one stage, the market was
weakened by news of agreement on
the Congo mines of Union Miniere.
This will open the way for exports and
involves the Belgian company retaining
a large share in the operation, it is
thought; details are not yet known.
The market came back to below
£430 before reacting.
THE outlook for cocoa prices has
improved, following lower-than-
expected output in Ghana. This
development has outbalanced some
disappointing consumption figures in
Europe and the U.S.
Original estimates of the current
Ghana main crop were for around
425,000 tons, but now at least one
U.K. dealer (M. C. Brackenbury and
Co.) has forecast 370,000 as the maxi-
mum. The firm says that a large
amount of cocoa will be required for
July-September delivery to replenish
consumer stocks which are at present
well below normal levels. The
Nigerian crop is also likely to be below
expectations, Brackenbury says.
The market had already gained well
by the beginning of this year, when it
settled at £stg.22o a ton. This was
equal to the best level of 1966 and a
good lift from the trough of £l2O
reached in 1965. The market spurted
again early in February to £stg.23s,
but has since returned to the New Year
level.
Above present, prices there is a
growing reluctance on the part of
chocolate makers to buy but, with low
stocks and little prospect of better
supplies in the near future, all the
signs are for higher prices.

COMMISSIONED books, commis-
sioned articles, commissioned
speeches, commissioned radio
broadcasts, and commissioned TV ap-
pearances are so much a part of life
today that it is refreshing to come across
something which clearly comes from
the heart. We refer to the “Message to
Woolgrowers” from Mr. Fred Moylan,
managing director of Moylan Woollens
Pty. Ltd. and chairman of the women’s
piecegoods section of the Melbourne
Chamber of Commerce.
His document seemed too long, some
of the points rather vague, and there
was a deal of poetic phrasing which
appeared to have little bearing on the
whole. The stamp of the professional
PR man was missing. So we called upon
Mr. Moylan and found him surrounded
by bolts of textiles of all kinds, colors,
and patterns. Some were wool, some
blends, and some synthetics.
The woollen fabrics, he told us, he
could sell “twice over.” Some of the
synthetics, and this is interesting, cost
a lot more than the woollen fabrics.
The idea, nurtured by the Wool Board,
that all synthetics are cheap is just not
so. “All that is wrong with wool is that
there is not enough of it,” said Mr.
Moylan. “I am talking about wool as a
textile. There is always room for techni-
cal improvements and the industry
needs to sort itself out. But basically
there just is not enough wool.”
Why had he taken it upon himself
to write his message to woolgrowers
and to have it typed and sent out to
the Press? “I just felt it was time that
somebody in the trade in Australia
said his piece,” he said. “You know
I have won awards from the Wool
Board in the past. I probably will not
win any more. But some things need
to be said, and as no else seemed pre-
pared to do it I decided to go ahead.
I started thinking about this about two
years ago and, as time went by, nothing
happened to cause me to change my
mind. In fact, everything seemed to
point an urgent need for a speaking-up
from the trade.”
Was he, as a wholesaler, attempting
to preserve his and his colleagues’ role
in the industry? Of course. “But it is
a pretty dynamic business and it has
been built up over hundreds of years
in many different countries in the
world,” he said. “It is a very complex
world-wide organisation and it is, by
and large, highly efficient in both the
industrial and commercial sense. The
good health of this complex keeps the
woolgrower in good health financially
speaking and I think that is what the
grower is inclined to overlook.”
Quoting frqm his document, Mr.
Moylan then said that the International
Wool Secretariat and the Wool Board
had fallen under the dominance of the
professional promoter. Textile and
fibre problems, however, must have tex-
tile and fibre solutions. Wool would
always have a dynamic price level. The
bale had never been unwanted and un-
used. Every bale grown had always
been bought and this could not be said
of many other products.
The wool market should not be con-
trolled. The IWS appeared to want
control of various critical points
product development, promotion, and
wool pricing. The idea had also been
scouted that the IWS should buy some
woollen mills. This would enable them
to promote their own ideas at
the manufacturing level. This had been
done regardless of the fact that while
chemical producers controlled their
supply situation, they could not control
the demand for their product and
neither could woolgroWers.
“The very nature, essence, and
character of wool and the wool article
is individuality,” Mr. Moylan said. “A
great monolithic structure will serve to
make wool products monotonous, neg-
ative, and uninteresting.”
WHAT did Mr. Moylan think of wool
promotion? He said that in his
opinion it had been a “complete waste
of effort and money.” “Fundamentally
a normal person cannot be influenced
in the purchase of apparel which is
tremendously personal,” he said. “If it
is possible to influence the market to
purchase a certain item of apparel this
secret remains unknown to the great
merchandising and manufacturing
brains of the Western world.
“The whole industry is geared to a
probe and search for interpretation of
textile demand and the numerous sales
of distressed apparel merchandise are
monuments to the mistakes of skilled
retail and wholesale merchants. In
fact, promotion can positively work
against the product promoted. In Aus-
tralia today wool promotion savors too
much of the act of saving wool and this
has had the effect of downgrading
wool.”
Mr. Moylan said that this lack of
confidence in wool, caused by Wool
Board promotion, had aggravated genu-
ine difficulties. These were not neces-
sarily of a long-term nature. They in-
cluded changes in fashion from woven
to knitted fabrics brought about by
more leisure and the motor car, and
stresses and strains in the U.K., Europe,
and the U.S. resulting from intense
competition from a “falsely costed”
competitor, Japan. In spite of these
things, any increase in production was,
in fact, taken- up, and any further in-
crease would have been taken up.
Woolgrowers and woolgrower
organisation leaders would do well to
look closely into the points made by
Mr. Moylan. For too long they have
allowed themselves to be brainwashed
by the viewpoint commissioned by the
Wool Board and the IWS.
We, on our part, simply wish to
stress even more than in the past that
by and large growers have not been
getting the real story. A classic example
is to hand. Some months ago a Wool
Board inspired campaign put it out that
defeat of the reserve price plan would
lead to an upsurge of private buying,
particularly on the part of Italian and
Continental superfine buyers who would
enter into private contracts with picked
growers (there are not so many super-
fine growers and there seemed some
logic in this commissioned viewpoint).
The recent Launceston sales resulted
in record and near-record prices for
most lines. Leading Tasmanian super-
fine grower Mr. R. O’Connor, of
Cressy, was quoted in the local papers
following the sales as saying that inter-
ference with the auction system would
be detrimental to superfine growers
initially, and, in his view, to all growers
in the long term. Here again is an
opinion which ought to be sought, and
considered along with the enormous
weight of Wool Board and IWS propa-
ganda.
Seeds of Discontent
A NUMBER of Western Australians
smell scandal in a deal between
the university and a seed firm over
Uniwager, a new strain of clover. The
clover has been developed by the uni-
versity’s Institute of Agriculture, which
runs on levies and grants from farmers
and farm organisations. In the past, seed
from such clovers has been made avail-
able to the farmers first. But this time,
in an imaginative piece of wheeling
and dealing, the Sydney firm of George
Fielder and Co. will be reaping the
rewards. Fielders are associates of the
American firm of Dakalb Shand in an
Australian seed firm, but the Americans
are not involved in this deal.
One ton of the first Uniwager seed
has been handed over to Fielders, who
have shipped it to India, where it is be-
ing grown during the northern winter.
They will return at the end of the grow-
ing season with what they hope will be
between 20 and 30 tons of seed. They
hand back the borrowed one ton to the
institute, then plant the rest commerci-
ally on the Esperance plain. From this
they grow more seed, having it avail-
able for farmers below a stipulated
price one season earlier than they
would otherwise expect it.
Part of the deal includes Fielders
contributing some $120,000 over the
next six years to university funds. The
whole arrangement is seen by the insti-
tute as an offer of the university’s re-

search facilities in return for Fielders’
technological and commercial follow-up
facilities.
But irate farmers and agriculturists
consider the contributions a pay-off for
a scheme heavily loaded in favor of
Fielders. The company stands to make
a conservative $300,000 in the first
season, and millions of dollars in sub-
sequent seasons. For the institute’s
agreement would include signing away
the right to engage, without Fielders’
approval, in the bulk production and
marketing of new seed varieties devel-
oped from its own research over the
next six years.
By crossing Uniwager with existing
tested seeds, agriculturists believe the
institute will come up with some out-
standing clovers, and it will be in this
development as much as the original
deal that Fielders stand to make a
healthy profit from their enterprise.
While there is an upper limit of 30c
per lb. on the new clover seed, many
of the best clovers available at present
are being sold for less than 20c per lb.
Other aspects of the scheme are felt
to be decidedly off-key. The decision
was made without approval of the
institute’s trustees, some of whom are
extremely put out. Dr. John Millington,
Reader in Agronomy at the university
and the man mainly responsible for
directing the development of Uni-
wager, is planning to join Fielders,
along with several of his staff, when
the scheme gets under way.
iA ND the land the firm will use to
propagate the seed has been bought
from the Esperance Land and Develop-
ment Co., which grew out of the Chase
syndicate, by dummying legally
circumventing the intention of the Act
governing the scheme to allow nearly
20,000 acres to be taken up in one
holding. The intention of the Act is
that one holding per person should
be taken up. The seed is to be grown
on an area about ten times as much
land as a usual holding.
But a later development is the fear
that weeds or disease may be intro-
duced into Australia when the seed
returns from India, or that, if disease
is picked up, the seed will not be
released from quarantine, depriving
farmers of its use. To be 100 percent
sure that such diseases as blue tongue
and foot-and-mouth disease were not
brought back on the seed, the seed
would have to be treated at or near the
point where it would be destroyed.
Because Uniwager is low in oestro-
gen, it is likely to be taken up in a
big way in the West, where high
oestrogen levels are blamed for low
fertility rates. Professor C. J. B.
Clewes, the university’s deputy vice-
chancellor, says there is nothing under-
hand about the deal, and claims that
scores of Western Australian farmers
will have reason to thank the uni-
versity for its decision and Fielders
for their initiative.

AGRISEARCH
Straw Mulch for Peaches
WHEN “two blades of grass are
made to grow where only one
grew before” the event should
not be permitted to pass unnoticed,
even though the crop concerned is not
actually grass and is of relatively minor
importance in the Australian economy.
The Victorian Department of Agricul-
ture has demonstrated that peach trees
grown under a straw mulch yield about
twice as much useful fruit than where
inter-row cultivation is practised.
At its Horticultural Research Station
at Tatura, in the heart of the Goul-
burn Valley, the Department has got
average yields of tons per acre by
straw mulching. A comparable section
of the orchard managed in the old-
fashioned way by inter-row cultivation
(spring and autumn) has given only
6| tons per acre. These figures average
four crops and so cover a reasonable
range of seasons. They can be consid-
ered to be close to the long-term figures.
Four bales of straw were spread
around each tree and renewed each
year. But even where the mulch was
not renewed, yields averaged 11 3 tons.
Other systems of management, e.g.,
maintaining bare ground between the
trees by chemical cultivation or by
growing legume cover crops, gave
up to 8| tons.
Straw mulching could not be expected
to produce such dramatic increases
everywhere. Truth to tell, the Tatura
orchard is on a very shallow surface
soil. Under these conditions cultivation
causes considerable damage to the feed-
ing roots of the trees, which are all
crowded into this thin band of soil. Also,
in these circumstances, weeds compete
strongly for moisture and nutrients and
even the roots of selected cover crops
spread to some extent in this band. The
straw mulch suppresses weed growth
and conserves moisture. Indeed, the one
objection to the system is that it raises
the ever-present risk of water-logging
the Achilles’ heel of peach trees.
Provision of adequate surface drain-
age'is vital and irrigations must be very
carefully controlled under the straw-
mulch system.
The economics have not yet been
closely analysed. Some of the antici-
pated yield increase could be swallowed
up in high costs. Nevertheless, the sys-
tem looks so attractive that it will be
no surprise if growers in other States,
where soil and other conditions may be
rather different, copy it to some extent.
Due mainly to new plantings, total
production of peaches in the Goulburn
Valley has nearly doubled over the
past decade. If it doubles again under
this new mothed of orchard manage-
ment the Valley may become recognised
as one of the world’s main sources of
canned fruit. The long-term market
prospects, both at home and abroad,
are bright.
TEMORA Agricultural Research
Station is agog because it has
shown that two newly introduced
varieties of annual ryegrass are greatly
superior to Wimmera ryegrass the
current main pasture grass on millions
of acres in south-eastern Australia. One
of the new varieties, unnamed as yet,
but identified as No. P. 6302, comes
from California and yielded 60 percent
above Wimmera. The other, known as
Merredin, comes from Western Aus-
tralia and is 51 percent better than
Wimmera ryegrass.
The figures, be it noted, are derived
from mowings. The differences are im-
pressively great and, therefore, prob-
ably .meaningful in terms of animal pro-
duction. But it doesn’t take a sage to
point out that the proof of the pudding
is in the eating. The figure farmers
want to know is how much more wool
or meat or milk can be made from the
new varieties.
The New Zealanders had a salutary
lesson on this point lately. A few years
ago their Department of Industrial
Research developed a new variety of
perennial ryegrass and released it to
farmers under the name “Ariki.” Meas-
urement of vegetative growth by cut-
ting trials had shown that it was clearly
superior to the existing commercial
variety Manawa. But then a grazing
trial of two years’ duration was con-
ducted. Identical twin cows were put
to graze pure stands of each variety.
Result: Cows on Manawa averaged
24.31 b. of milk a day; cows on Ariki
averaged 22.41 b. Explanation: the cows
preferred the taste of Manawa or found
this species more digestible. Hence they
ate more and so were able to make
more milk.

Rather Sensitive on the Falls
WHAT an unnerving week we’ve
just been through. I may be
unduly sensitive, but it’s difficult
to take these sudden falls —especially
as there seems little logic behind them.
If I were in the United States or
England I could understand the market
being nervous. After a long run of
bountiful years, America is entering
a more sober era. Marked down too
severely last year, the market seems
to have established itself at a level
some 10 percent above last year’s low.
Even the U.K. market is 5 percent up
from last year’s low; the worst is over
but it will still be a long, slow road
to complete economic recovery.
Our own market is a little higher
than a few months ago yet barely
anything to get excited about. For-
tunately this loss of confidence in the
market does not seem to have any
effect on the business world. Evidence
of this has been the gratifying interim
reports from Larke Consolidated and
Malleys. It is worth noting that both
these companies are in industries highly
sensitive to the mood of the economy.
With Government direction, interest
rates have been steered down in the past
three months. Always a good guide in
the past to the behaviour of the stock
market, it’s not unreasonable to exnect
a corresponding move in dividend yields
in due course. How often has it been
said in the past five years that the
market was at an attractive buying
level! So often that to utter the state-
ment again only brings smiles of
derision. Nevertheless, I’m confident
that the next couple of years will fully
compensate for many of the past disap-
pointments.
One stock that, over the years, has
battled steadily ahead against the tide
of the market is the Sydney Gazette
stock of the month— Hanimex. On the
cover page is the new Hanimex tape
recorder. So far it is the only one manu-
factured in Australia. Hanimex will be
in an enviable position if it can get the
tariff protection applied for recently.
With the likelihood of a good interim
report around the corner, was the
market right in marking these shares
down to $1.35? Not in my books, so I
added 200 shares to the portfolio.
If you feel that the 15 cent fall in
Hanimex was severe, how would you
classify the 60 cent fall in Rothmans
in the past three weeks? What put the
skids under Rothmans was the interim
report. A magic name in the market
until a few years ago, Rothmans now
finds itself the underdog again. In an
attempt to regain some of the cigarette
market, the company spent so heavily
on promotion during the past half-year
that profits fell from $2,885,000 to
$1,022,000. What’s more, the interim
dividend was cut from 10 to 6 percent.
Bad as this result is, it still should be
kept in perspective. Rothmans shares
should be worth more than $2.00.
Two good interim reports in my list
of companies: Darrell Lea came up with
a 15 percent profit increase and
Alliance Holdings followed in the foot-
steps of several other finance companies
by materially increasing profits. When
sold, Darrell Lea added $2O to the
kitty, while the contribution from
Alliance Holdings was $32.
