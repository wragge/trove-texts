STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen :
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G HEWETT,
“ 213 Pitt street.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female Sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite, and
general depression of spirits cannof do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must dp good to all
delicate persons.- Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find, this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As %n antifebrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S

We rerommed these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.

The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.

these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.

meals diluted with same quantity of water. For

Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider thSm moat
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, 18SG.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect, and change
in my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflcted as I have
been may take advantage of them.
“ I remain, dear sirs,

SATURDAY, JULY 2, 1892.
The Queensland Electoral Bill.
The Electoral Bill, which the Griffilwraith
Ministry has piloted through the Queens-
land Assembly by a vast majority, is nearly,
though not quite, the last of a series of mea-
sures whose seeming purpose it is to make
Samuel Griffith the perpetual Premier
and Dictator of the North. For apparently
it is the ambition of Griffith to be in
Queensland what Lopez and Franco a were
in Paraguay or Juarez in Mexico—a species
of irremovable potentate ruling over a free
nation, which, being interpreted, means a
nation that is free to vote for Griffith. The
Queensland Premier has always regarded
himself as more than a man and a shade less
than a god ; he has posed, ever since his first
appearance in politics, as something different
from those ordinary, makeshift politicians
who come and go and are presently forgotten
—he has struck a perpetual attitude as the
heaven-sent saviour of his country—as a
statesman whose reign would only be
terminated by death or voluntary resigna-
tion. The idea that the country which had
once possessed the inestimable blessing of
being ruled by Samuel Griffith would ever
voluntarily dispense with him lay altogether
outside his original calculations. In the
early part of his career he started out to
play the part of the King of the Poor, and
to reign in the hearts of the people by
virtue of certain weak and fuzzy maun-
derings about Socialism, human equality,
and the rights of mankind in general. There
seems to be every reason to believe that
Griffith, by reason of his theories and his
ill-digested platitudes, firmly believed him-
self at one time to be the father and bene-
factor of his country ; he put none of his
theories into execution nor did he attempt
to do so, but he was vaguely convinced that
Queensland owed him a debt of undying
gratitude merely because he possessed
shadowy yearnings after something which he
imagined to be progress. And when a
general election came,and MTlwraith swept
the country on his short-lived Nationalist
programme, Griffith felt as Jove might
have donc.had ho been kicked by a helot,
and believed, in his diseased and semi-crazed
vanity, that he was the victim of a monstrous
act of ingratitude because the nation which
he had blessed with a few badly-written and
incomprehensible essays had deserted him,
and his faith in humanity flickered out there
and then.
* # #
rherefore, when he came back to power,
be abandoned his role as the King of the
Poor, and proceeded to take a systematic
and personal vengeance on the people whose
crime it was that they had failed to appre-
ciate him at his own insane valuation. His
belief in the divine right of Griffith was
unimpaired, and those who did not believe
in that divine right he regarded much as the
Bourbons or the Valois did those who
failed to appreciate the beauties of their
system of government in the days of abso-
lutism. The central axiom of his faith is
that Queensland exists to furnish fame and
a permanent billet for that Griffith who is
only one degree lower than the angels, and
having learnt by experience that the nation
cannot be trusted to do its duty and vote
solid for him on all occasions, his policy is
now to systematically disfranchise every in-
dividual and every class which shows an
inclination to vote against him. A much
greater man, one Benito Juarez, when his
country failed to appreciate his abilities by
electing him for a second term, solved the
difficulty by the simple process of taking no
notice of his successor; - his term expired,
and he peacefully remained in office, and
when the people’s representative arrived to
take over the position, he merely froze him
with his eye, and declined to be aware of
his existence. Except for Griffith’s utter
lack of personal courage, he and Juarez
would be very much alike in their policy.

The new Electoral Bill is one more item
in that great scheme whereby nobody except
the supporters of Griffith will be allowed
to vote in Queensland, and anybody who
doesn’t vote for Griffith shall be disfran-
chised. It consists, to all intents and pur-
poses, of two clauses, which read as follows
Every claim made by a person to have his name inserted
ill an electoral roll must set forth the age and occupation
of the claimant, and must be declared by the applicant
before, and attested by a justice of the peace.
Any justice who signs any such certificate without per-
sonal knou’ledffe or full inquiry , for which purpose he
may require the applicant to depose to the fads upon
oath, shall he liable on summary conviction to a penalty
not exceeding fifty pounds, and on such conviction shail
be incapable of being or acting as a justice, or of being
registered as an elector or voting at any parliamentary
election for the period of five years from the date of the
conviction.
Under the new order of things in Queens-
land, therefore, no one shall have a vote
unless he can find a Justice of the Peace
who is able and willing to swear, upon his
own personal knowledge, to his identity.
Therefore, all the thousands of people,
mostly workmen, who are not acquainted
with any Justice of the Peace, are politically
abolished in one act. And for the rest of
the male population the case stands some-
what as follows.
• « *
In Queensland, with hardly an exception,
the J’s.P. are Conservatives of the old,
aggravated type, and the great majority are
members of the bogus-Patriotic League,
which supports Griffith, and the Kanaka
policy, and the land-grant railway Jobs,
and the interests of property generally.
Griffith, in fact, is the Patriotic League—
so long as he continues on his present course
—and the Patriotic League is Griffith, and
the J’s.P. are both of them under another
style and designation. Therefore, the demo-
crat, no matter how good his qualification,
who desires a vote, must apply, in the first
place, to one of the boss members of the
League—which is formed for the express
purpose of preventing him having a vote—
to attest his claim. If that individual
doesn’t know him he will refuse to sign the
necessary document ; if he does know him
he can refuse all the same. There is
abundant provision in the Act to suppress
the J.P. who signs a certificate that is
incorrect ; there is absolutely nothing about
the J.P. who refuses to sign the one that is
correct. The “ Patriotic ” League possesses
a tolerably accurate list of every democratic
voter in each electorate, and such an indivi-
dual will probably find hardly one Justice of
the Peace, from Torres Straits to the Border,
who will place him on the roll. If he does
find one, however, it is tolerably certain
that the J.P. in question will presently get
into trouble. The penal clause is very wide
and comprehensive, and if, by any chance,
the few Justices who are not the servants
and agents of the Patriotic League should
pass a sufficient number of voters to imperil
the Griffilwraith majority in any elec-
torate, it should be easy to get a conviction
against them and secure their abolition. The
number of persons that a J.P. can be per-
sonally acquainted with is limited, and he
cannot personally enquire into the cases of
more than a very small number, even if he
gives his whole time to the work. More-
over the new qualification is so restricted,
and so full of man-traps, spring-guns, and
pitfalls that no Justice, however careful, can
long avoid mistakes. Therefore, should any
official, or any score of officials, exhibit a
tendency to fill the roll with democratic
voters they will presently be entrapped into
signing certificates for some of the informers
of the Patriotic League, and then they will be
convicted before a bench filled with J’s.P.
who are members of the League, and thus
removed out of the way. The item which
provides for summary conviction is a note-
worthy feature in the scheme. A matter of
such importance, it might naturally be sup-
posed, would be relegated to the Supreme
Court, but jurisdiction is strictly reserved for
a tribunal where the Patriotic League runs
the entire show. And the League, as already
mentioned, is practically Griffith himself.
Under the new Electoral Act Griffith,
through his agents, has the sole power of
putting his own voters on the roll and keep-
ing all other voters off; he is the court which
sits in judgment; he is the prosecutor, the
judge, and the jury, and, in effect, he is the
whole electoral-roll in himself. In a word,
Griffith is to be Queensland and Queens-
land is to be Griffith. That is what the
whole thing amounts to.
# » «
Also the Upper House —by virtue of his
many nominations to that petrified institu-
tion—is mostly Griffith, and its assent to
the Electoral Bill is therefore almost a
matter of certainty. At such a time as this
the evils of the nominee system become most
conspicuous. When the country, in some
moment of aberration, elects an Assembly
with a bigoted Tory majority, that House at
once proceeds upon a course of retrograde
legislation which is enthusiastically endorsed
by the Council in the interests of Property ;
but when a democratic Assembly succeeds
to power, and endeavours to undo the
evil that has been accomplished, the
Upper House inevitably blocks the way.
Therefore, if the people of Queensland
should, by something approaching a miracle,
succeed in returning a Liberal majority at
the next election, the Electoral Bill will still
continue in force, unless the Council can be
scared into submission by the fear of actual
violence. The only variety in the legisla-
tive programme consists in the fact that the
great mass of the people have sometimes
both Houses to contend with and sometimes
only one. And now that the apostate
Griffith has a permanent lien upon the
Upper House, and has taken measures to
make himself sole proprietor of the Lower,
there is only one thing more to be done.
That is to give the two branches of the
Legislature equal authority, so that if, by
any unforeseen contingency, some future
Assembly should prove hostile, he can rest
his authority upon the support of the Coun-
cil, and put the people’s representatives
altogether at defiance, and run the country
by himself. It is not impossible that he may
make the attempt, for his madness becomes
every day more evident. The autocrat who
threatened, on his own single responsibility,
to “ exclude ” a Labour member from the
House because he objected to the Govern-
ment policy, and ■who accused the Labour
party of advocating the murder of their
political opponents, assuredly has high ambi-
tions to become a Dictator of the Lopez,
or Guzman Blanco, or Santa Anna order
if he only had the courage necessary for
such a role. Still, however, there is one
difficulty in his way which may, sooner or
later, prove fatal. The Electoral Bill, if his
subordinate agents dare to carry out its pro-
visions effectually, will make Griffith
Dictator of Queensland. But MTlwraith
sits on his shoulders like an Old Financier
of the Sea, and by-and-bye, in all pro-
bability, they will fall asunder through both
desiring supreme authority, and the Patriotic
League will have to choose between them.
If MHlw’raith comes uppermost then
Griffith will be sent into comparative
obscurity, and after that MHlwraith him-
self will probably die of apoplexy, and chaos
will follow. And if Griffith wins, the
chances are that M‘llwraith will turn his
coat once more, and stump the country with
a frantic policy of broken heads and flaming
houses, and thereupon Griffith will gather
up his legal blue bag and fly for his life.
There is a grave yawning for every Dictator,
and the one for the Queensland Premier is
already dug.
Australia at Chicago Exhibition.
If the New South Wales Government were to
accept D ires’ suggestion and withdraw its
application for space at Chicago Exhibition that
great show would be never one penny the worse,
But the province would be many thousands of
pounds the better, and at present it has cer-
tainly no thousands to throw away. For, with
the solitary exception of wool, Australia has
nothing to show the Yankees in which they are
interested, and has as much chance of opening
up a trade with them in any other commodity
as of transacting business with the man in the
moon-

American timber with American tools--the

Australia—and will still light them with Ameri-
can kerosene when finished. But he will not

Considering that there are thousands of men
out of work in Sydney, and thousands more in
Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane, and that
rigorous retrenchment is the recognised order
of the day all over Australia, it really seems
as though, it would be better to spend
the money Australian courts would cost in
local works, which would give bread to
the hungry, rather than upon the travelling
expenses of a parcel of honourable Commis-
sioners and their honourable flunkeys. If
Americans want Australian wool they will send
to Australia to buy it, or go to London to do so,
or perhaps invite direct shipments as the
Belgians did some years ago. But the Honour-
able Doctor Rex wick will haveno influence in the
matter, nor will the 740 N.S. W. exhibitors who
have applied for 200,000 feet of space, which is
nearly twice as much as the American authori-
ties feel inclined to grant, be of any service.
The wool-buyers, of whom there may be fifty,'
will take their own way and will not trouble
themselves about the Chicago exhibition. And
the best thing Australia can do is to leave it
alone also, and to devote to some useful purpose
of the poor the money which would have been
spent in useless extravagance by unnecessary
representatives.
How to Keep Out Smallpox.
Tji ere are many hundreds of Australian
medical men \\ ho have never seen smallpox
and would not know it if they did see it.
There are many scores of thousands of Austra-
lians who look upon the disease as extinct, who
regard it much as they do the plague or the
Black Death, and chafe mightily at the pre-
cautions which are adopted to prevent its
entrance or to stamp it out when it manages to
creep within our lines. This it often does, and
will do more frequently as the speed of steamers
increases and voyages are shorter. When it
does come we scream and sw'ear and hunt down
the victim and quarantine him or her, rather
brutally now and then, and sometimes pay
heavy compensation when we have nabbed
the wrong man, and then sit down
and plume ourselves on the vigorous
measures by which we “stamped out” the
enemy. But, excepting in our moments of
panic, we can hardly be brought to believe in
the enemy’s existence. We affect to think—a
good many of us—that the long-continued
ravages of smallpox were merely due to the
defective sanitary arrangements of our fore-
fathers and to the crowded condition of their
cities ; and we treat it as something that will
disappear as mankind learns better how to live.
So, for that matter, will typhoid, consumption,
and insanity, but just now it cannot be too
clearly understood that our partial immunity is
due to conditions which are rapidly disappear-
ing. Smallpox is always raging in Africa,
where overcrowding, at any rate, is not a rule
of life. It is rampant in China, and sovereign
in Ceylon, whence, indeed, comes our most
recent danger, and it is always hovering about
those islands of the southern archipelago whence
the Kanakas are presently to be brought into
Queensland to cultivate godliness and the
sugarcane.
« # *
Smallpox is one of the many gifts which the
Holy Land conferred upon the Crusaders who
took it back with them to Europe where it
reigned unchecked and scattered death broad-
cast for more than 700 years. Indeed, even
after Jenner discovered, in 1799, a counteract-
ing disorder, cow-pox, which, up. to this time,
has proved the best preventive, it took 50 years
hard fighting to reduce smallpox within
manageable limits in England alone. It is only
within the lifetime of the present generation
that British medical men have felt themselves
fairly able to cope with the malady or that the
sight of a pock-marked person has ceased to be
common in the London streets. Even yet con-
signments of the disorder come regularly to
that city from Smyrna and Aleppo, from Con-
stantinople and Cairo ; and no man who boards
a sailing ship on its arrival from the Levant
can be sure that he will not catch it himself or
convey it to his family. And as small-pox is
the most contagious of all febrile diseases, the
most dangerous, the most distressing, the most
debilitating and the most disgusting, it
can be easily understood that it is by no means
a welcome or desirable visitor. It makes the
victim an object of horror to those who love
him best, and of dread and loathing to those
who are otherwise always sympathetic and
helpful. It leaves behind it an ineffaceable
outward disfigurement, and an unconquerable
inward weakness, so that, in nine cases nut of
ten, the individual who happens to survive a


. seizure'finds himself unable to decide
' hether it would not, on the whole, have been
Tetter for him had he gone quietly off to limbo
Then he was first attacked.
# * #
Absolute and perfect isolation is still the
jy means of preventing the disease from
decimating the community in which it appears,
£ . e there is no moment, from that in
which the sufferer receives the contagion,
U 1 that in which he is pronounced
■fectly W ell, when he may not communi-
cate it to anybody about him. He infects the
■fir he breathes, the clothes he wears, the fur-
niture he uses, the house he inhabits, the wind
(hat passes over him, and the ground he treads
upon. If bis own case is a light one the chances
*g (hat he will communicate a heavier and
more virulent form of his ailment to any recep-
tive subject, and the result is that no one comes
within hail of him who can possibly keep away,
jf by chance it breaks out in a crowded London
court or alley inhabited by the very poor, there
is nothing to be done but to imprison the
wretched people in their miserable homes
until it has passed away, and the attend-
ants have to share the imprisonment and
take their chances. Those who have been suc-
cessfully and recently vaccinated or have them-
selves suffered from the disease escape, but
even medical science can do little for the
sufferer avlio is once infected. If the terrible
irritation can be allayed, the air passages kept
openandthestrength maintained, the victim may
live through it, and to these ends the doctors
address their utmost skill, very often in vain,
since, after the period of incubation is over and
the nature of the attack is unmistakeable, there
are still from fourteen to twenty-one days to be
passed before the crisis arrives and the balance
inclines towards life or death.
• # #
If we wish to keep smallpox out of Australia
we must tight it at the outports. Our first
quarantine station should not be in Port Pljillip
uor at Port Jackson, but at Colombo. Before
the Australian liner starts from that port, the
strictest medical investigation should be made,
in order that no person may embark who has
placed himself in danger. There is no
clanger at present of persons who come more
than a fortnight’s journey bringing infection
without the knowledge of the medical in-
spectors. A man who left England with the
seeds of the disease in his constitution would
be in a fair way to convalescence before he
could arrive here if he lived to complete the
voyage. It is the people who come from
infected places within a fortnight’s sail of our
shores we have to regard with suspicion, and
there ought not to be much difficulty in arrang-
ing for proper supervision of those persons
before they begin their journey.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Poor Jack!”
Some further revelations in the case of the
sailors of the British Commodore—who were
recently tried in Sydney by that eccentric
autocrat, Magistrate Lee —afford another un-
wholesome advertisement for Australian justice
as it is shovelled out by the stipendiary “beak”
of the period. Several weeks ago the crew of
this vessel were brought up on the elastic
charge of “disobedience,” they having inti-
mated—in effect—that they would sooner go to
gaol than take their chance on board the British
Commodore, which they alleged to be a total
Avreck aloft, and unfit to proceed to sea. As a
previous crew had been in trouble, also for
“ disobedience,” it might have occurred to the
Court that there must be something rotten in
the state of the vessel when so many sailors
were anxious to get out of her. Nevertheless,
Magistrate Lee didn’t even adjourn the case in
order to get independent evidence as to the
condition of the alleged coffin-ship ; he simply
listened to the statements of the captain, who
Avas an interested party, and having got his
single, bald declaration against the unanimous
testimony of the sailors, he sentenced the latter
to eight weeks’ imprisonment. He also went
out of his way to assure them that it didn’t
matter even though the press took up their
case, as they would do their two months
in gaol whatever happened. Then, hav-
ing sentenced the crew on the assumption
that the vessel was thoroughly seaworthy,
the law ordered a survey, with a view to
decide whether she was seaworthy or not, and
whether the captain shouldn’t have been
arrested instead of the crew, thereby showing
that it was by no means certain of the matter,
und had only gaoled the men on general prin-
Cl ples, as they were poor and friendless, and
no one was likely to make a row about them,
the surveyors announced that the lower part
0 , t " e J'igghig was somewhat worn and out of
culer. but that the upper part was in thoroughly
good condition. This was just the sort of
icport which might have been expected, as the
<ueiage marine-surveyor seldom ventures aloft,
uud he generally passes the upper part of the
Jggmg rather than risk his neck in strange
syniiiastic feats among the topmasts ; but even
118 statement tended to corroborate the crew’s
< ssertiong to some extent. Then it was dis-
yeied that the sentence of eight weeks’ im-
-1 ~ 80m i lle nt Avas altogether illegal, as the magis-
wj e ,4 P°Aver to award four weeks only,
0 . 9 re 7 Avould appear that that individual

leaving 33 available for service.. Of these 30
are old ponderous Conservatives representing
the Atkinson, Hall, Stout-Vogel and other
deceased Ministries and policies which the
country has long since abandoned, and exactly
three represent the Liberal party which is now
in power by the sanction of a vast majority of
the people. Seven of these Tory nominees were
appointed by Governor Onslow at the request
of the Atkinson Cabinet after that body
had been defeated, and had tendered its
resignation, but when it was holding
office provisionally pending the arrival of its
successor ; yet the same Onslow, who had filled
the Upper House with the derelicts of a dead
Conservative Cabinet, refused to make any
nominations to oblige the live Democratic
Ministry which succeeded it. His successor,
Glasgow, promises to be a little more amen-
able ; he is just Tory enough to be of no use, and
just Liberal enough to save himself from rotten
eggs and execrations. He offers to send up nine
Democrats to the Council, so instead of every
Radical measure submitted by the Ballance
Government being contemptuously thrown
out by thirty votes against three, it will
be thrown out by thirty votes against twelve,
and the results will be just the same, though
the figures will be slightly different. The
beauty of a nominee Chamber can never be
fully appreciated until a really Democratic
Cabinet is in office. If the Ballance Govern-
ment can hold on for 25 years, and as each
venerable Tory dies can fill his place with a
reliable Liberal, and can prevent its new
members becoming petrified and useless in the
interim, it may succeed in doing something at
last. But if it wants to do something now the
shortest way seems to be to stand over Governor
Glasgow with a shark’s-tooth club, and give
him the alternative—either lie must nominate
30 Democrats in one act or the club will come
down. It would be unconstitutional, no doubt,
but there is no way out of the difficulty that
isn’t unconstitutional.
The first sign of returning prosperity is visible
in Queensland —rents are beginning to go up.
The rise is noted principally in the sugar dis-
tricts, where property is reported to have
increased in value something like 20 per cent.
There is not the slightest sign up to date of any
rise in wages, nor is work any more plentiful,
nor are the unemployed any less hungry. The
people who were homeless before are still home-
less, and there is no improvement in their pros-
pects ; you can still get 200 applicants for a
miserable little clerkship at 15s. per week, and
all the roads leading west and north and south
are trodden hard by the feet of hundreds of
men looking for work and never finding it.
Under the regime of the big landlords the posi-
tion of the worker only begins to improve when
the revival of trade is well advanced, and
rents have been going up for a considerable
period. Sometimes the revival is only a
false alarm—it will probably prove so in the
present case—and then wages don’t rise at all;
after rents have gone up a little and property
has begun to sell at better prices the spurt is
exhausted. Moreover, the present movement is
confined to the sugar districts, and if it does
progress far enough to make an improvement in
wages it will only be an improvement in the
wages of the nigger-stealer, and the South Sea
pirate, and the Government agent, and the pub-
lican who fills these buccaneers up Avith rum
when they come back from a cruise among the
islands, and the ordinary Queensland labourer
isn’t in it. But, despite all these deductions, it
is a gladsome thing to hear of a sign of return-
ing prosperity anywhere or upon any terms,
and there is doubtless joy in heaven—or the
other place—when rents begin to go up. Most
likely it is in the other place.

In the case of M. H. Foran, avlio un-
successfully appealed to the Victorian Full
Court for a mandamus to compel the Minister
of Education to produce a letter which he had
received from Foran’s immediate superior
officer, and to which Eoran’s dismissal from
the Public Service was allegedly attributable,
the application was refused with costs against
the plaintiff. According to the English law
“the interests of justice, as far as individuals
are concerned, must be subordinate to the
interests of the whole State administration of
which the Department of Justice is merely an
integer,” and the Australian ruling is in accor-
dance with this statement. The sooner this
kind of philosophy is knocked on the head the
better. Foran is, in this particular, a victim
to a piece of tyrannical bureaucracy. That
without the welfare of the part the health of
the whole can exist, cannot be logically
admitted.
J. M. Davies, M.L.C., brother of Sir Matthew
of that ilk, became grieved and shocked when,
at a meeting of shareholders in the Real Estate
Bank, Melb., somebody referred to Agent-
General Munro as a “ disgrace,” whose appoint-
ment was a “ monstrous thing.” These observa-
tions pained Davies to such an extent that he
threatened to leave the room if they were
repeated. In effect, he was already protesting
against the possibility of dear M.vttheav being
reviled in public. Bluff is out of the question
now, however. Members of the old “repre-
sentative ” crowd can look lofty and shriek
“ Shame !” when the robber chiefs are spoken
of without reverence, but the poor devils
who have lost everything will be awed into
silence no more. The majesty that used
to hedge the financial gang of Melbourne
has gone for ever, like Munro and Matthew
I). Nobody respects anybody nowadays, and
unless the present Government have suffi-
cient pluck to make a holy show of several
people they themselves will be set down as
being no cleaner potatoes than the rest. Only
the other day Shiels was slobbering over the
late delectable Premier and his comrade in
greatness, Matthew Daa’ies. Each was a sad
loss to 11 1 c position he had' honoured, &c., &c.
Their names stank in the streets even then, and
now that the London Times calls one man a
rogue in the language of diplomacy, and the
other fellow is a “disgrace straight out, if
must he about time that Smuts, as the head of
his Gracious Queen’s Government, made a
public recantation of the faith that lit' re cully
professed.
Melbourne is agitating (in the columns of the
Age) for cheap fish. The better kinds of local
fish are unquestionably dear at present prices,
and the middleman takes the big profits, for
the destiny of dead fish, all the world over, is
to fatten the first buyer at the expense of the
last buyer, whilst the original catcher and the
small hawker do badly all the time. But the
idea that good fish will ever become cheap and
plentiful in Victoria is as absurd as the notion
that brown coal can be pushed into popularity,
A Victorian fisherman can do no more than
cast his net and haul it in, and when he hauls
it in he lias to look hard for anything that was
worth the netting. He can never expect to
net enough profit for himself to encourage a
rush of men into the same line of business, and
until hundreds more fishermen are engaged in
catching large quantities of tasteless fish for
the sake of the few palatable fish to be found
amongst them, the public will go on gorging
itself with meat as usual. The “sinful
waste ” of fish is a fact from which a fictitious
moral is drawn. A grey mullet destroyed
doesn’t necessarily mean a mullet wasted, except
to the indignant journalist who has never parted
a hard-earned shilling for mullet, and subse-
quently wept for his indiscretion. The Age
may dream dreams of “ delicious, wholesome
fish at a reasonable price,” but the reality is,
generally speaking, a mullet, an article no more
wholesome than a lump of yesterday’s bread
Avithout butter, and not half as delicious.

From an English paper :
It is pleasantly suggested by some party politicians
that if Thomas CoorEß, the once famous Chartist, had not
become a writer on Christian Evidence and a Liberal
Unionist, he would not have received a couple of hun-
dred pounds out of the Civil List. This is hardly the way
in which Mr. Musdella, who applied for the grant, looks
at the matter. He thinks that the First Lord of the
Treasury has done a very kindly thing in relieving the
necessities of an aged man whose literary talents are in-
disputable, and who during more than part of his life has
laboured hard to undo the evil he did in the other portion.
This sort of thing is often met with in the
servile English press. What is the atrocious
evil of which Thomas Cooper, “ the once
famous Chartist,” was guilty in early life?
Simply being in sympathy with a band of men,
in advance of their time in ideas, though
woefully behind it in their knowledge of the
best way to enforce their demands. Cooper has
lived to see the English people in possession of three
of the articles of the charter : Abolition of Pro-
perty Qualification, Ballot and (almost) Univer-
sal Suffrage (obtained in that order), and also to
know—if in the intervals of his researches into
Christian evidences he has time to take further
note of such sordid subjects—that nearly the
whole of what the English papers love to call
“ Greater Britain,” pays its representatives.
The only other thing advocated by the Chartists
was the weakest item, viz., annual Parliaments,
which nobody in the present day wants particu-
larly, so far as The Bulletin is aware. But
this is always the way. Because Cooper puled
on Christian evidence and avowed himself one
of that set of mongrels who are known as
Liberal Unionists he is held to have expiated
the sin of previously upholding the enlightened
principles, which his countrymen have since
affirmed, and has atoned for) his former evil
deeds.

To all appearances, gold will ere long become
as scarce as available land. Here are some of
the figures : Total value of gold in world’s cir-
culation, about £1,500,000,000, of which 670
millions are in the form of coin. World’s
annual output of fresh gold, 6,000,000 ounces,'
to which Australasia, the U.S., and Russia
contribute 1,745,570 ounces, 1,586,304 ounces,
and 1,120,695 ounces severally. Australasia
coins almost as much as she produces, i.e.,
£5,550,000, and nearly approaches the amount
put through by the London Mint, i.e.,
£7,500,000 each year. The world’s yearly
increase in gold is only one-third of a million
ounces, and of the entire production of six
millions of ounces, half is devoted to the pur-
poses of arts and manufactures. As the pror
ductiveness of the above-mentioned three
principal countries has been for the last four
years at an almost nominal rate of increase,
unless fresh fields shortly are discovered most
of the gold now in use for ornamental purposes
will have to go into the mints’ melting-pots, or
else the scarcity of coin in comparison to the
increase of general population will gradually
raise the purchasing power of the sovereign.
As Australasia is .just now producing just
enough to supply each head of her population
per annum with the magnificent sum of £2, and
as, during the last 20 years, four-fifths of her
total gold output has been exported to foreign
shores, it is as well to draw the attention of
local political economists to the future outlook,
and ask them to consider the advisability of
restraining the efflux of future “ yellow boys.”
It may be possible to improve State
organisation. It is quite impossible to improve
the conditions of trade as carried on by private
firms.
Dear Bulletin, —A “Jimmy Woodser”
may mean a solitary drink (or a solitary drinker)
in some places, a “ Jack Smithers” in others, but
in the Western district of Victoria, if a man takes
a drink by himself, he is said to “go Ballarat.” —

“ The orthodox theology is practically use-
less, or worse than useless, here. It first invents
a crime, and then invents a punishment, and then
invents a means of escaping punishment. Its
heaven is the reward—not for good and virtuous
conduct, but for believing in the ‘ plan of salva-
tion ! ’ Its hell is the reward—not for false and
evil deeds, but for heresy !” — Rev. O. Walters , in
“ The Criminal’s Ascension, or from the Gallows
to the Golden Streets.”
Dr. Manningtou Caffyn, of South Yarra,
Melbourne, has, by establishing a hydropathic
institution, supplied a great public want—long
keenly felt in Australia. He has recognised the
futility of the ordinary medicinal methods of
curing alcoholic and morphia-craving's and by
lifting the patient physically beyond the reach of
unwholesome appetites docs what drugs can never
do. The methods employed at Dr. Catfyn’s insti-
tution include massage, exercise, suitable food,
ami electric and steam baths. The results
achieved by these moans in skilful hands have been
marvellous.

SIC Maoquarie-street North, Sydney, June 29, 1892.
Alv Dear Moorabinua,—
The Nov Imperial Opera House (why “Imperial” in
this happily Emperor-less land ?) which is the same old
Sydney Opera House with the addition of prickling palm-
leaves on the narrow, toilsome staircase, and artistic re-
upholstering of dragon-blue plush, with box draperies of
grey velvet brocade and dragon-blue silk—opened (Mr.
George Forbes is the manajah—which is—aw —awf’ly
jolly, donch’novv) last Saturday with a mild amount of
fashionable eclat-about as much as you meet at an
amateur show. But it all died out half-way through the
exasperating fiz-giir, or “ Whirligig,” or whatever it was,
and one killed time until one’s wheelbarrow was due at the
door by sitting in judgment on one’s neighbour.
Mrs. W. Mitchell’s get-up of ivory silk and silk guipure
with diamond necklace, was a thing of beauty and-a joy
to its wearer ; Mrs. Burdekin wore black, of course, with
a hunch of autumn leaves on the corsage ; Miss Burdekin
also-in black lace with pale terra-cotta ribbon hows about
it; Mrs. (Mayoress) Maiming kept on a cream opera-wrap
sprinkled o’er with pink roses and trimmed with white
fur; her daughter in a babyish white silk gown; pretty
Miss Bensusan wore black with a becoming knot of cox-
comb red in her hair. Lady Salomons was wrapped up in
a heckle-feather boa. There was also a bounteously-
f on tied lady on view who had gotten herself up most
gorgeously. Fancy any woman with village-blacksmith
arms widening them still further with a line of pink silk
down the upper side ! And just imagine her pronging
two big flaring roses in the side of her full-sized skull!
Behind the footlights the most unnatural thing was
when the male parvenu was made to enjoy himself amid
his gilded surroundings, while his wife, in red silk,
yearned for the hack-parlour over the shop. In real life
it’s always “the missus” who eggs her husband on to
C.M.G. lengths, isn't it ? Bella Bashall was the prettiest
personality on the stage, and looked very fresh in her
first frock,of lilac and dark-purple velvet, with flop hat
trimmed with myrtle and wheat; but in the second act
she should have worn what one’s grandmother called a
camisole with her white muslin gown—as it was, you got
to know too much about what she had on underneath.
By the way, Mrs. Bennett didn’t appear on the first
night, though it was announced in the newspapers, and
society was on the qui vice to see how she got on. As she
didn’t appear, society is still on the qvi vine. The ways
of theatrical managers are dark.
Miss Myra Kemble, resting in Sydney after a successful
M.L, run, seems to have enjoyed herself among the
Maoris. When the Co. disbanded, the members thereof
presented Myra with a pretty silver card-case. In a day of
empty treasuries and stranded companies, it’s pleasant to
hear of a tour going through on salary and ending as
above.
By the way, Miss Kemble’s “ Dr. Bill ” performance in
aid of the Sydney unemployed promises to be interesting.
It is to be played by Society amateurs, possibly in the
Centennial Hall, and the tickets will range to a guinea.
As Government House official mourning for Lord Ancram’s
death ended last Monday, it is possible that Captain
Leigh will fill the title-role, and Mr. Goschen take Cecil
Ward’s part, but nothing is definitely settled so far.
Let people who discuss the latest newspaper ’errors
with their olive-branches listening mouth-agape, take
warning from the recent nursery experiences of a Sydney
medico, who is not only a most skilful physician, but
looks like one. His two youngsters somehow heard a
great deal of Rainhill-raurder talk, and, being imitative
little rascals, resolved to “play Deeming.” As a result,
both are now in a critical state of health—the one from
being half-flattened-out with a stone supposed to repre-
sent the hearth, and the other from the whacking he got
from his pa.
Rather a novel show was afforded by fencing-master
Schuch’s pupils at Sydney Oddfellows’ Temple the other
afternoon, when parry, cut and thrust, with much stamp-
ing of feet and a sound in the air like the house-father
sharpening the carving-knife, filled in an hour or so very
pleasantly before dinner. Judging by the medical men
who straddled around the platform (for you get about
like a crab, or an aggravated case of bow-legs, when you
pursue your adversary with a skewer), fencing must be a
very hygienic pastime. Drs. Fiaschi, .Marano, Roth,
Bury and Ellis, Mr. Rolin, Mr. Windeyer, and Mr.
Gaulhiac, were the gentlemen who assaulted one another
with buttoned foils (in all bu.t three instances, when
snakey swords leaped forth, and you couldn’t see the
combatants for wire and wadding), and there were two
ladies—Mrs. Bowes and Miss Hawley—who pinked one
another in an amiable way early in the bill.
Fencing comes next to fiddling as an effective accom-
plishment for the woman with a good figure, but until
she leaves off the padded, awkward-looking cuirass and
hideous mask which are the safeguards when you are
sticking your man for exercise, she won’t have much but
her science to make her worth watching, believe me. By
the way, at the feeing Contest it was noticed that when
a lady was pitted against a trembling man she always had
last thrust. The ruling passion strong even in sword-
play, you see!
There was a crowd in the hall, headed by Lady
Windeyer, and including so many men that I couldn’t
help wondering how many happy invalids were having
one free afternoon, at least, to gel well in ? The audience
seemed to enjoy it, and the applause was gusty as the
wind outside—but what a pity they hadn’t music! A
pianissimo bar or two helps a thing like that immensely.
What would the “ Corsican Brothers’ ” duel be without
all that tremulous orchestration ?
Mr. M'Adoo’s Jubilee singers sound very tuneful in the
York street hall. For one thing, everybody is so articu-
late,, and in the idiotic nigger melodies it really is most
necessary to know what they’re all about. Mrs.
M‘Adoo’s tenor warblings are astonishing—she ought to
have worn a dress-suit instead of pale-grey silk and lace
to go with her voice. Miss Julia Wormlie’s recitations
are a success—yea, even to the extent that she only wants
a few judicious pot-plants, some fairy-lamps, and a
switch tailed frock to be Adelaide Deletion's hated rival.
What strange instinct is it that makes people send expen-
sive wreaths and things, with large visiting-cards pro-
minently attached, to the coffin of the aristocrat who
didn’t know ’em from Adam ? It’s taking an unfair
advantage, I consider, to pile expensive offerings on the
name-plate of a deceased individual, who would probably
have sent them back post-haste if they had been offered
to him living-but here again Jenkins, with ids vokn
miuous note-book, is at the root of it. The little line in
the “ noosepaper ” next day, “ Mr. and Mrs. Moses Isaac
Jacob’s names were attached to a lovely wreath with the
beautiful consolation, ‘There is no pershent in heaven,’ ”
is the reason why pushing people send very clearly-
printed cards hanging to pallid vegetables whenever Any-
body (with a huge A) shuffles off this mortal coil.
Lady Jersey attended the Earl of Ancram’s funeral
(with which the foregoing paragraph is absolutely uncon-
nected) and by doing so has cleared the way for lots of
women who want to hear the stones rattling on their clear
departed’s coffin, but have had to keep at home up to
date because it’s etiquette. Yet, in this particular in-
stance I think precept is better than even vice-rega 1
example. Women are mere bundles of surface feelings,
and there would be harrowing scenes in cemeteries it it
were socially proper for them to attend interments.
Besides, as they are the cause of most men’s deaths it is
only good taste for them to stay away from the burial of
their victims. Until they learn to conquer their sobs (at
the expense of a red nose, mind you '.) by gazing fixedly
at the lining of their hats in the superior masculine way,
women had better stand out of funeral processions, no
matter if Lady J. goes to a dozen in a week.
An influential committee is working up a grand com-
plimentary benefit concert to Mrs. Vandeveer Greene,
who leaves for New York on Bth Aug., next. The conceit
is in recognition of her “very valuable musical services
during her sojourn in N.5.W.,” and I hope the lady’s
many admirers will make it a success by attending in
astonishing numbers. It is not altogether decided— by
the way—that Mrs. Van. will study for the operatic stage
when she reaches Milan ; it is probable that she will
only further cultivate her lovely sympathetic voice for
the concert platform.
I heard an unusual sort of anecdote of a well-known
Southern professor of music. He was passing a house in
a Melbourne suburb lately in which a budding vocalist
was going through some flighty exercises on the wrong
vowels. Hearing which the professor rapped smartly at
the door and sent his card in with the polite inscription,
“ Professor Blank Dash’s compliments to the young lady
with the beautiful voice, and wishes to advise her to sing
her exercises to “la-la” instead of “do-re-ini.” It was a
very kind thing to do, of course—but in this eccentric
age of cheap advt. one is so prone to wink the oilier eye !
Monsieur Claudius Deslouis will shortly appear before
the world as a composer, lie lias recently finished a
song, “Les Saules” (The Willows), the words of which
are by’his son, Marcel Deslouis, whom the Parisian papers
term “a second Beranger.” “ Les Saules” is in C minor,
and ends most effectively on E natural.
It is interesting to know that Teddy Blueskin Royce
went to school with Herbert Standing. Some actors’
memories are too long for other actors’ looks. At the
Bernard Beere reception in Smellbourne, a lady sealed
next to the genial Teddy questioned him enthusiastically
about Mr. S.— did Teddy know him? and so on. “Madam,
we went to school together,” said Blueskin. “Indeed!
but wasn’t there some—er —discrepancy?” “ Madam, we
were both ten years old forty years ago !” said the candid
Teddy, while the Beere’s leading man looked unutterable
things across the table.
Teddy Royce’s benefit is to happen at the Criterion on
6th July, and everybody wishes him a bumper house for
the important occasion. Benefits, though, are often
expensive matters to the beneficiary, who doesn’t always
clear it by two figures, especially when lie or she has to
pay for the use of the theatre—but then you seldom hear
of that, because it’s more flattering to Thespian amour
propre to have the temple “kindly lent,” even if it’s only
on paper. One Australian firm of managers have a rule
never to lend their theatre to anybody-not even their
most invaluable mummer—except for a pretty round
figure, so it often happens that managers Sock and Buskin
get the bag instead of the beneficiare as onghter. What
appears to be, and what is, are hardly first cousins in
Stagehand, are they?
Apropos benefits, the reason alleged why Pattie Browne
didn’t get a Sydney send-off has more or less wounded
susceptibility in it from one point of view. And the other
person who might have roused to action had a scheme of
vengeance to wreak on somebody— so the green-room
gossip goes.
I am told that after a hank smash down South, the
other day, the authorities of a certain church were called
upon to reduce their overdraft, whereupon the incum-
bent, an old gentleman who draws in all about £l2OO a
year, recommended that the curate’s salary be reduced
from £3OO to £250. The curate has a wife and eight young
children, whereas his ecclesiastical superior’s family are
now all independent of their saintly pa. The wardens—
who were afraid to oppose the proposition—consented,
and, as the wretched curate couldn’t possibly manage on
so small a stipend with his house full of youngsters, he had
to make room for an old cheap-labour celibate clergyman.
Tiie curate is now trying to get work and his wife has had
to take a position as teacher.
The only difference to be detected in the prismatic
“La Cigale”—viewed again with a calm, eighth-night
expression—is that Charles Ryley’s beard has been worn
off, presumably by too close contact with Marie Gallon's
C sharp, which is sharp enough for any bartering pur-
poses. By the way, the over-proof limelight, brighter
than any that jets precipitated at George Henry V., is
rather unkind to the stage complexions of the company.
There was a sassiety circle on the eighth night. A
magpic-frocked theatre-party (it has been correct lately
to leave off parrot plumage on account of Lord A.’s death)
included the Misses Cox and Miss Clara Manning; but a
theatre-party in black and white isn’t a radiant chromatic
addition to the reserved seats. Carrie Swain wore a
pretty grey-and-pink frock with diamonds about it:
one lady in a big grey checked shawl drawn up « la
counterpane appeared to be snoring fitfully by her atti-
tude.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Another man who has carried arms in Her
Majesty’s service is charged with murder. J. J.
Cat ter, a private in the S. A. militia, shot his boon
companion through the heart last week, by way
of putting a moral finishing-touch to a review
whereat they had worked themselves into a blood-
thirsty frame of mind by blazing away with blank
cartridge. The Australian soldier is becoming an
important consideration in matters pert lining tJ
homicide.'

The greatest of all Mrs. Bernard Beere’s
successes in Sydney up to date is “Adrienne
Lecouvreur,” which was put on at the Criterion
on Saturday, and prospered exceedingly. It is a
profoundly pessimistic drama, and because of its
pessimism is all the more true to the eternal
verities. Its moral is that there is no poetic
justice either in heaven or eartli or—so far as
evidence goes—ln hades ; that all is not for the
best; that the fabled mills of God which are said
to grind the transgressor exceeding small are as
likely to grind up the saint as the sinner ; that
virtue isn’t its own reward ; and that blessed is he
who has the heaviest feet and the most callous
heart for lie shall inherit the earth. It is the story
of a great and noble woman who dies miserably,
while the gaudy, boastful soldier for whom she
sacrificed herself lives, probably to forget her and
be happy with someone else; and the rival who
killed her goes peacefully on her way ; and the
cynical priest who gibbered round all through the
five acts goes on gibbering indefinitely. Mrs.
Beere’s acting throughout this long tragedy
is a exhibition of true genius, and it is hard
indeed to find even one weak point in the char-
acter of the lost Adrienne. Next to her comes M.
Marius in whose hands the kindly, sympathetic
old Michonnet is not a dramatic character, but a
living reality. Herbert Standing as the callous
ecclesiastic with the absent soul lias a part that
just suits him, inasmuch as he is apt to be a
trifle hard and unsympathetic, and the Abbe is by
nature as hard as the nether millstone and the
upper one also. Maurice de Saxe, as played by
Otno Stuart, is a gaudy and sometimes rather un-
satisfactory soldier, who stands grimly upright
like a sentry during a great part of Adrienne’s
death scene, and lias bursts of violent emotion
when he isn't standing upright. The rest of the
show consists principally of Miss Isabel Urquhart,
who scores the greatest success she has yet
accomplished, and Mr. J. F. Catheart who does
likewise, and the Criterion isn’t large enough to
hold the public enthusiasm, and the drop-scene is
being fast worn to rags by much hauliug-up in
acknowledgement of the frantic applause of the
audience.

The aged rafc and the bloated spider which
has no flics upon him, and the gopher which
walketh in darkness because his deeds are evil,
have been ejected from Sydney Opera House, and
the old establishment has resurrected in all the
glory of its fresh upholstery, and looks even newer
than many a new theatre can afford to look. The
circle is gay in its adornment of blue plush, and
the walls are an {esthetic green, and the roof is
green likewise, and the gaslights cast a greenish
radiance upon the audience, and the new curtain
is a dream of loveliness, and the now scenery is
altogether fair to look upon, and everything is
bright except the comedy of “The Whirligig”
which is sadder than a frozen gnome in a lifeless
world. The author —whose name isn't given—has
obtained three of the longest intervals that were
ever heard of, and round them he has wisped a
thin and very small comedy, which suggests
nothing so much as half a pound of jelly hung on
a vast skeleton—the skeleton being the great
desolation of waiting, and the other flabby sub-
stance the thing that happens when the waiting
is over. The plot is short and easily described.
In the first act a broken aristocrat’s estate is sold
to a rich grocer ; the aristocrat loves the grocer’s
daughter ; he and his sister and his maiden aunt
are left penniless; and the retired tradesman
generously gives them his old shop by way of a
fresh stare in life. In the second act the fallen
swell tries to run the grocery establishment, and
sells rough-on-rats in mistake for flour, and
otherwise fails to make the business pay; and in
the third act the grocery-man gets tired of his
unnatural splendour, and lie gives the haughty
scion the estate back again, also Ins daughter, and
his blessing. The shrieksorae humour of the
play consists in the circumstance that the
young man can’t find the tea, and that
the old one feels miserable at the sight of his own
flunkey, and when these two facts are exhausted
there is nothing more. The play is called “The
Whirligig,” because the grocer, in his last public
utterance, makes a pathetic allusion to the whirli-
gig of life, and his wife backs him up in his rash
statement. But in spite of these drawbacks, we
love the new comedy, and intend to go back and
see it persistently so long as it lasts ; we love it
for the calm restfulness of these three long, long
intervals—it even begins with an interval —for
their holy peace and Sabbath stillness—for the
dreamy sense of silence and sleep, and the absence
of all trouble. They are the best things of their
kind we ever met, and it isn’t every company that
knows how to put an interval on the stage so
that it will be a reality and not a mere painted
imitation.

The lessee—our dear old friend, George
Forbes —has put a strong company into this
desperately weak comedy. The three principal
male characters are played by J. R. Greville,
Henry Shine, and George Lash Gordon, and it
would be hard to find a much stronger trio.
Also that lovely and diaphanous vision, Bella
Bash all, fills the part of the grocer’s daughter, and
Miss Rosa Conroy and Mrs. Edouin Bryer make
up a total of six individuals who would arouse
much enthusiasm if it were not that circumstances
are too heavy for them, and every separate ham
in the grocer’s shop uses like an accusing spirit to
state that enthusiasm, in snoh a show, would be a
wasted emotion. The only name in the whole
cast which creates even the slightest tendency
to execration is that of Miss Hardie, who has
a particularly bad part, and deserves one
that is many degrees worse. Also, there seems to
be every ebanee that she will get it sooner or
later. Even the first night audience was too much
crushed to applaud anybody ; it gave a cheer for
the new drop-scene, and then fell back frozen and
paralysed, and remained that way till the end,
except once, when Greville was heard murdering
cockroaches among the side-scenes, and then it
smiled a sad smile as jf it had been after cock-
roaches itself in otlieudays, and knew they were
hard to catch. YU

“ La Cigale,” at Her Majesty’s (Sydney))
has not improved since it. was last heard of. It
never will improve, in fact; unless a new plot and
a new libretto are inserted, and everything is born
again right down to the gas-man, it must remain
as it is to the end. No one can make a chest of
drawers out of a sow’s ear, nor do figs grow in a
pawnshop, and these two Scriptural observations
express the situation exactly. Marie Halton, at
the time of writing, is announced to leave’for
Yurrup by the Polynesian, her place to be taken
by Miss Violet Yarley—who isn’t in any way
related to a certain awful butcher-evangelist of the
same name. “ Marjorie,” with Lauri and Henry
13racy in the cast, will be produced on Saturday
(J uly 2). At the Garrick “ The Bells ” are still j' u
evidence, and every night about 9.30 they tinkle
dismally among the snow-drifts, and a ghostly
sledge, with a ghostly horse in the shafts and a
ghostly Jew on board, stops at the door of Mathias
the burgomaster, and silently invites him to come
out dnd be lost. Also, a little comedy entitled
‘‘Up in the World” serves as a curtain-raiser. It
is built upon the central fact that the rich
Christopher Mudlark’s brother —in the green-
grocery line—calls on him and behaves like a
comic hog in the dining-room; and the moral is
that no matter how elevated we may be we should
never be ashamed of our humble brother Bill, but
should rather feel glad when he comes round in a
misfit white hat, and wants a winkle and a drop
of gin, and breathes an odour of fish upon our
daughter.

Sundry deserving shows, large and small,
are bearing up manfully against the irrevocable
edict that all theatres are grass. The sweet-voiced
Jubilee Singers are gradually tapering off at the
Centenary Hall. The human snakes and the
howling skeleton ai’e in good form at the School
of Arts ; and at the two aquariums (Bondi and
Oqogee) the damp, depressed fish, and the hippo-
grif, and the octopus, and the wild sardine raging
in his tin are as fresh as ever. A matinee benefit
is to be tendered to Mr. E. W. Royce, at the
Criterion, on Wednesday (July 0), and if the
results are equal to the occasion half Sydney will
be trodden under foot in the rush. At the Wax-
works a new clairvoyant and mystery man reveals
the past and the future, and tells you what your
wife did when you were out, and tells your wife
what you did when you were not in. A very
successful amateur performance was given on
Monday at the Garrick—kindly lent by Mr.
Bentley, under the supervision of Mr. Geo. Lash
Gordon—kindly lent by himself. The bill was
various, and the performance was a trifle better
than the average of its kind. Also, a reasonable
amount of business is doing on Saturdays and
Sundays at the Royal Standard.

Tommy Hudson is now farewelling at the Town

A strong force of the B. and B. company
appeared at Melbourne Bijou on Saturday in
comedy ancient and modern, an audience worthy
of the occasion having braved the stormy wind
that blew “round the town” meanwhile. Tither-
adge, Sass, Miss Temple and Mrs. Brough started
the double bill with a polished performance of “In
Honor Bound,” a fin dc siecle story often told in
the firelight upon the'same boards but never quite
so effectively told before. The purified version of
Wycherley’s “ Country Wife,” played in Sydney
a fortnight back, forms at least a bright, interest-
ing contrast to the polite gloom of Grundy’s
comedy. Pattie Browne in boy’s clothes would
appeal to the popular taste at any time, and now
that the days of Miss B. are numbered, and the
date of her farewell benefit is announced, an
opportunity of seeing this versatile vision at her
best ought not to be missed. The humour of
“The Country Girl” is too thin and bitter to
delight a depressed community, nevertheless.
Any sympathy that the old play arouses is claimed
by the man who gets hopelessly left at the finish,
and whose chief fault lies in the fact that he has
just turned fifty.

Moody’s desire to marry his tasty little
ward seems a pardonable weakness, and if the
fooling of him under aggravated circumstances is
a satisfactory purpose for a play then “The
School for Scandal ” should have held Sir Peter
Teazle up to scorn. Had Moody married his
rustic charmer before bringing her to town, as
Teazle did, she would evidently have thrown him
over without a shade of compunction for the first
Belleville who came along. But no matter. Pattie
Browne contrives to make a fascinating picture of
a pitiless young angel, whilst her speaking of the
epilogue softens down the hardness of its senti-
ment. Lawrence repeats his Sydney success in
the part of Moody, and the company is as before
witli two exceptions. Cecil Ward does all that
can be expected of Harcourt, and Miss Brenda
Gibson, much disguised, wrestles with the un-
suitable character of Alithea. To-night (Thurs-
day) the Drapers’Association wifi form a “push-
ing young party ” in the upper-circle, which por-
tion of the house was to be reserved for junior
footballers last night. On the afternoon of Friday
next (July Bth) sweet Pattie takes her farewell
ben. under vice-regal patronage.

At the Princess’s there were not the
crowded attendances looked for during last week.
The Foli concerts, supplemented in each instance
by an act of Italian opera, didn’t fetch the
mythical musical world to any great extent, so
the musical world may consider itself an exploded
delusion entirely. The bulk of its population
don’t exist for paying purposes, and take no
interest in sweet sounds which can’t be appre-
ciated on the nevah. A truly artistic season will
wind up to-night (Thursday) with a last perform-
ance of “ Lucia,” and when the curtain falls upon
Signora Cuttica & Co., in this, their finest effort,
the Melbourne public can safely assume that they
will never look upon such a show again at the
same reasonable price.

then depart for Adelaide (a holy city where they

broken season at the Opera House before attack-

flourishing. Opinions differ as to whether this
burlesque is better than ‘Faust Up to Date,” but
probably it is equally good. How good the other
may have been is also a mixed question.

“Crainond Brig ” hasn’t been played on the Australian
metropolitan stage since Lilians was here. Lilians, once
stage-carpenter at Edinburgh Royal, was coached in his
art by author Murray himself and afterwards hy Wynd-
ham. Boisterous, hut not a bad Scotch comedian, Lilians
shone as Bailie Nicol Jarvie in “Rob Roy,” Dandie
Dinmont in “Guy Mannering ” and Jock Hovvieson in
“Cramond Brig.” In the latter piece, a great favourite
in the hungry days of the stage from its introduction of
haggis and sheep’s head—Nellie Stewart, fresh from the
hands of Miranda—whither she was daily escorted hy a
young woolbroker who waited for her in Carlton Gardens
—sang her first solo, “Jessie, the flower of Dumhlane,”
on the stage of Melbourne Royal. Soon after the Stewart
family went busking in “ Rainbow Revels.” By the way,
Lilians, great pals with Solicitor Lavey and Jimmy Alison,

The Music Hall, a little horgan of the song and-dance

a few unkind things about poor old Johnny, which are
worth the notice of certain Anglomaniacs who found fault
with The Bulletin, two years ago, for rating the “cele-
brated English comedian” at his true value. “Not
having seen every had actor,” snarls the candid publica-
tion in question, “ it might perhaps he unfair to say that
Mr. Toole is the worst of all possible actors, hut he is so
near an approach to the worst that the difference is
scarcely perceptible. For years he has strutted, an
uncouth, gibbering, lamentable ohjec , on a stage that has
long ceased to want him, and successive failures have
plainly indicated the public desire that (his ghost of

Some years ago a large Sheep-station
was being sold in Melbourne, and among
those present at the auction was a rich Sydney
man, who, evidently, had been looking on the
wine when it was red. Bidding started, and soon
the Sydney man joined in, and kept on nodding
to the auctioneer until the station—which he had
never seen in his life and knew of only by name —
was knocked down to him for a few hundreds of
thousands. This little transaction got the Sydney
man into difficulties, from which he has never
been able to extricate himself.

A Plea for the Country.
When the city’s sons of Thespis from the “ army ” or the

Storm the suffering country people and unroll their
“ pops ” in view,
And begin with bowl and dagger with three direful acts
to dally,
Then we wonder why in thunder don’t they give us
something new.
Since we saw their plays in Sydney, time has grown senile
and hoary,
Still we strive to waken pleasure, hut we find our strife
in vain,
For departed is our relish for all prehistoric story—
We have heard them in our childhood, must we hear
them yet again ?
Is it but to kill the longing for the good old melodrama?
Is it hut to point a moral that our feelings are out-
raged ?
Proving thus the/drama’s horrors to the simple-minded
farmer,
Is this why these seedy supers all were specially
engaged ?
How we long for something recent, how we sigh for “Art
and Ruskin,”
In the place of hlood-and-thunder dramas of the long
ago,
Can we wonder at the terror folks have for the sock and
buskin
When the mournful country drama reeks of agony and
woe?

Graham Berry can satisfactorily prove that James Munro
didn’t sell a lot of paper to the local Mercantile Bank
shortly before it closed. Or show that if Jimmy did dis-
count £23,000 worth of hills as alleged, the said docu-
ments were worth the depositors’ cash paid for them.
For_ clearing up mysteries of this kind an aggressive
official liquidator is worth 50 friendly winders-up, some-
how. Every depositor in the Mercantile is directly in-
terested in knowing whether Munro negotiated those hills
of rumour, and, if so, why a moribund institution came
to change good gold for paper in its last moments, and a
free and independent depositor i.s entitled to howl for the

and the hank got inflamed at the thought of so much
coin lying around loose, hut Treasurer M'Millan didn’t
respond to the overtures worth a cent. What a high old
time these hankers would have had if £250,GC0 or so of
Government money had been deposited over their shabby
little counter—what a rush for overdrafts—and what a
general granting of loans all round ! The spectacle of a

Unique mining manager's report from Croydon,
N.Q.: —“ Iron Duke and Nancy Dee G.M. Co., Ltd.—Mr.

Walking on a razor’s edge would be preferable

The Sydney banks have a plethora of money,
and the rate of interest stands at 4J per cent. Yet at the
present market price Federals and Commercials of Aus-
tralia yield nearly 10 percent., Cities 8, and Joint Stocks
6j. To those whose interest means perhaps their only
source of income, and who are not keen enough to watch
the market, the safest method is, of course, fixed deposit.
It is rarely that the depositor does fiot get a full return in

An outspoken correspondent wants to know how
about the 2000 tons of reserved 2oz. ore, alleged to he
accumulated on Faulkner’s mine at Lamhula, and all
about the Pam bill a G.M. Co. with “its stores of 15oz.
stone,” and why Ml. Gahan can pay a monthly sixpence
dividend, while these mines, of which a great deal more
has been said, pay none? Well, here you are:—There is
no heap of 2000 tons accumulated at Falkner’s. There are
several hundred tons, but the present writer would not
like to wager that it would yield more than 2oz. by ordi-
nary treatment, or that as much is in it. The Lamhula
mine has no 15oz. store of ore, hut a heap of about 250
tons, whicli might yield an ounce per ton. The difference
between Mt. Gahan and these two claims is apparent to
anyone who has seen them. The former has a fairly big
body of rock, with the gold well distributed through it,
while the other two have small shoots, which are or have
been rich here and there.

There- is at least one good mine near Drake,
N.S.W., owned by Rivers and party, who, without outside
assistance, have opened up I heir mine and had regular
profitable emailings for nearly two years. It is a peculiar
formation which averages 2oz. per ion. The battery is a
miserable little thing. Pity the yields are not published
to encourage the industry. The publication of all yields
from private claims is compulsory in 311'.
The Rise and Shine mine is in N.S.W. on the
Q. border at Toolooin, where many thousands of ozs. were
won from the early alluvial. It was found hy Payne and
son, who extracted 1500ozs. hy dollying in a quicksilver
bottle. It is a small ironstone lode and is now all well
opened by a Brisbane Co. The gold occurs in very riel)
pockets, a characteristic of all ironstone mines.

The Bulletin anathematises the N.S.W.
prospecting vote as a useless fraud on the public
revenue. The writer knows that in some instances 30s.
a foot has been received and tne work done for £1- the
receivers pocketing the balance ; in others they manage
to get “measured up ” hy the warden’s clerk just ere the
shafts fall in. Subsidies from the vote are recommended
by officials who know nothing of mining, and tens of
thousands are being thrown away hy a hard-up Govern-
ment. Where is there to-day a paying mine the result of
the N.S.W. prospecting vote? or, where is there a field
anywhere, with a reasonable show, that lacks prospecting?
Again we say, let the money he spent in establishing a
mining college, with big metallurgical works to treat
difficult ore and teach Australian youth. Hundreds of
parents would pay big premiums for such a training for
their sons.

Australia is badly mixed in its silver-mining
industry. Silver was first profitably worked at Boorook
(N.S.W.) near the Q. border, hy one Horton, who worked
it for gold, and when he cleared up got silver instead of
gold amalgam. The metal was in the form of an anti-
monial sulphide found in quartzite. With the assis-
tance of an English expert, Mr. Davy, the mine
was worked for years with splendid results. Boorook
subsequently fell into the hands of some Mount Mor-
ganaires who abandoned it upon the richness of the latter
mine being revealed.
* * #
Something which looks permanent has been
found near Dalmorton, N.S.W. It is known as “ Cadeli’s
Claim.” Several parallel veins running in a black slate
are carrying gold to the extent of 3oz. per ton, and are
opening up well.

White Rock (capital =£1,(303,000), the gigantic
silver mining failure which was fl< ated on lies and cham-
pagne, has receded into that primeval loneliness from
which many a ruined man wishes to Heaven it laid never
emerged. There it stands, with the paint hard y mhhed off
its gigantic plant, a monument 10 human madm ss in
times of booms and booms!ers. It lias tlie magnificent
engine which supplied the electric power of the whole
of Melbourne Internalioual Exhibition; a sixty-head
plant built iu Chicago ; sevi ral massive boilers, a number
of true vanners, steam pumps, numerous dams, a tram-
way, and a hundred other appliances all costly and new.
All erected for what?-a lot of irregularly-defined small
galena veins which cannot he min d without taking away
the body, wnich will only average some seven or eight
ounces of silver to the ton. Yet it is only the king of
many similar failures which have squelched an industry
that might now he supporting an additional 10,000 ,mcii.
Mining men can as well ;.s others excuse a mining mis-
take, hut White Rock was'a palpable failure to any mining
man worthy of the name from the jump. A big American
mysteriously reported well of it. Subsequently another
American visited it, and expressed his surprise as follows:
“ Great Heavens ! Did he speak well of this? If so, I
guess he must have carried the ore away with him,’ 1

The “ tipster ”of a Sunday paper “trusts Mt.
Stewart will not pay a dividend until next month, and

The newspapers are helping the manager of the
Mount Allen mine, away in the Ear West, to revive the

ing has been stretched on the old piece and jointed, and
is now in its position on the wheels.” We can see the
boom coming.

Never in Australian mining history were there
so many mining plants in course of sacrifice as at pre-
sent. It is the natural aftermath of the boom. There
certainly was a time when the erection of Costly
machinery was accepted as prima facie evidence of value.
A syndicate for the purchase of second-hand mining
plants should pay.

Dear Bulletin, —Your yarn about the
confusion between a comp, and a litterateur in the
same office and bearing the same name, reminds
me of something that lately occurred in an Aus-
tralian metropolis. (I shall now invent fictitious
names, but every other particular is true.) There
were two brothers, so much alike that everyone at
a glance would swear they were two brothers.
One was a literary man whose name was Mop. The
other was canvasser for a paper “with the largest
circulation,” &c., named Besom. Whence the
difference in name ? Well, I don’t exactly know.
All I do know is that the family name is a
hyphened abomination—Mop-Besom. Mop, for
reasons satisfactory to himself, had dropped the
Besom end of his appellation. He had just failed
gloriously with a country paper, and was in the
metropolis dodging process-servers on account of
unpaid libel-costs. Besom was in full fling, a
sober, respected and solvent member of society.
A bailiff, in full hue and cry after Mop, has that
individual pointed out to him. He starts in mu-
suit and taps’Mop on the shoulder. He explains
his errand. Mop peruses the document. “ Ob,
thuds all right,” he says, with such an air of
childlike stupidity that ’tvvere irreligious to dis-
believe, “but you’ve got the wrong man, that’s
all. You want my brother, who goes under the
name of Besom, and is a canvasser for the Daily
Bangletop.” Bailiff apologises, and, in sheer
contrition, shouts. Mop “sherries.” Bailiff
rounds up Besom, gets frightened out of his seven
senses after doing a preliminary bounce, and then
rushes back for Mop’s hotel. Alas ! the man had
gone to Timbuctoo, and left an unpaid board-bill
behind him. —Yours, The Dipsomaniac.

The report of sharebroker Derbin Willtlcr’s

Old Jock Nimmaw lias “ stairted ” on a

the late Victorian Ministry roll up to bid their
former colleague adieu and wave their umbrellas
until the vessel was almost out of sight. Jock
Nimmo, alas ! is hopelessly played out. He’s a
decent old fellow who has “filled many public
offices” which lie never ought to have filled, and
made an object of himself in Parliament for 19
years, but now Jock is as publicly and politically
dead as the dodo. The brither Scots who hold
him up have dropped him, and seeing that there
never was a sufficient reason for supporting woolly-
headed J.N. in the first instance, he isn’t such a
real object of sympathy as would appear on the
surface.

We saw something the other night that
was either high-toned courtesy or amazing cheek,
only we can’t decide which. There was a tall,
weary-looking man in a fruit-shop, and the girl
was getting some oranges out of the window for
him. She was a very handsome girl. The
window-ledge was broad, and it sloped down-
wards, and the oranges were at the very front,
right up against the glass. The girl reached for
them, and the next we knew she lost her balance,
and, with a wild scream, her feet went up and she
was falling right into the plate-glass. In another
instant th -re would have been a fearful smash,
and the gi 1 and the ruins of the window would
have gone into the street together, only another
girl rushed out from behind a screen and clutched
the falling maiden by the ankles as she lay head-
downwards among the fruit, with her hair flying
loose and a deep blush on her countenance. Then
the customer dropped his umbrella, and fled round
the counter to the rescue, saying, “Aw—permit
me,” but before he had got quite round, the lady
in the window made a tremendous effort and got
out, and lie retired as suddenly as he came. And
what we have been wondering ever since, is
whether he intended to assist to get at the
oranges, or whether he meant to make himself
useful by dragging a complete stranger out of the
window by the ankles. He looked so disappointed
that the latter seemed the more probable. Only
when a pretty girl accidentally stands on her
head in a shop-window, she is sometimes a little
particular about the sort of fellow who lifts her
out.

British law lias just decided that a man who
“ hove ” a decanter at a woman’s head and missed
her, breaking a window instead, can’t be punished.
He was charged with “assault and wilful damage
to property,” but he got off on the assault charge
because lie missed the woman—therefore there
was no assault; and ho was acquitted as regards
the wilful damage because ho meant to smash the
female and the smashing of the window was
purely accidental.
Report from an inquest upon a recent
suicide at Liverpool (Eng.): “ Her father stated
that she had a mania for reading sensational
reports, such as murders,, suicides, and other
tragedies. Latterly she had been somewhat
absent-minded. On the night before her death
she sat up with her sister tib 11 o’clock ; then the
sister went to bed, and deceased remained in the
kitchen reading an account of the Rainhill
tragedy. At one o’clock Alice came down and
found her hanging by a shawl from the top of the
kitchen door. There was a difficulty in account-
ing for her position as she was nearly 12 inches off
the ground, and there was no chair or stool at
hand by which she might have climbed up.”
Probably Deeming’* ghost came to her in the
kitchen at midnight, just when the fire was
getting low and the candle had burnt out, and
gave her a lift behind the door so that she could
get her head in the noose. It would have been a
gay spectacle— the spectre on all-fours on the
floor giving a back to the suicide who was too
short to reach up and hang herself without assist-
ance.
Land-buying from the natives in the good
old Maoriland days was profitable, but risky. As
the lands were held on the communal principle, it
was necessary to obtain the signatures of a whole
tribe ere a title-certificate could be secured for the
smallest block. Frequently the fact of one or
two tatooed old chieftains refusing to sign would
cause the purchase of land on which thousands of
pounds had been advanced to remain incomplete
for years—sometimes until the death of the mal-
contents removed the obstacle. Hon, John
Sheehan, a thorough Maori linguist and the first
native-born pakeha to occupy a seat in M.L.
Parliament, was a most successful signature-
getter. His private secretary, a dry, old Scotch
pressman named Garrick, used to tell of his
experiences with Sheehan on a land-buying expe-
dition to the Waikato frontier. “Naethin’but
whusky an’ rum for four blessed days ! No bees-
ness at a’. Hunnerds o’ Moories aboot and a’ o’
them hiecuping ‘ kapai Sheehan ’ all ower the
toonshup. Then Sheehan cam’ to me wi’ a wink
o’ his ee’ an’ says ‘ Noo’s oor time,’ and a’ that day
he kept me twustin’ roon’ a zoetrope—one o’ them
whurligigs wi’ pictures ontil them—to inak’ the
niggers pleasant, and, sirs, he kept singin’ them
‘ The night that Larry was stretched ’ awhiles
whuppin’ cot his parchment an’ gettin’ signatures
like one-o’clock. We pit the whole block through
that day.” Poor Sheehan, who drank himself to
death before lie was 40, was one of the readiest-
witted of men. Struck full on the breast with a
stale egg at a hostile election meeting, he remarked
without a quiver and with a reassuring smile that
almost conveyed the idea that lie accepted the
mal-odorons attention as a compliment, “Gentle-
men, I like a good, strong, healthy opinion, even
when it takes the form of rotten eggs. ’

Fifteen miles of the Cairns (Q.) railway

The battle hero, and the fire-brigade hero
and the burning-ship hero, and the railway-
pointsman hero have been very kindly dealt with
by the newspapers, and now The Bulletin
hastens to record the heroism of one-armed men
There is a bullock-driver at Port Albert (Vie.)
who had bis left arm amputated at the shoulder
some years back. Ninety-nine men out of a hun-
dred would have sat down and wept and lived on
the wash-tub exertions of their wives; but not
this one. Ho trained himself to wield the huge
bullock-whip with one hand, to hold the yoke
with his shoulder while he fastened the rings
on the team, to tighten his saddle-girths
with his teeth, and to bridle his horse
with ilia chin and the remaining arm. He can
even fell trees and is one of the best axemen in
the district. He is a tall, gaunt man with tin*
voice of a bo’s’un, and cuts a terribly pathetic
figure in Ins unfortunate mutilation. The other
one-armed hero is a selector at Toora (Vie,),
Many years ago lie lost his left arm through a
mining accident. Since then with the help of his
one arm and the great heart that was more to him
than a dozen arms to the man without grit, h e
has cleared his selection, built him a dwelling-
house and farm buildings, and laid down his
selection with crops. He drove every nail used in
the building of the house, though how he managed
that is a mystery ; he ties and unties knots with
his teeth, rides like a Centaur, and yards cattle
like a Queenslander. Yerily, the heroism of the
one-armed man is the heroism of heroes.
Rev. Father M‘Kernan, the escaped priest,
who promised for a few weeks to be a new Edith
O'Gorman in N.S.W., has left his admirers in a
very tight place. The Father (his front name is
Moike) professed to have seen the error of his
ways, and delivered sundry lectures on the immo-
rality which prevailed in convents, and the way
the unctuous fathers hugged the younger nuns,
and little things like that. He was an attractive
object with the gaslight shining on his tonsure,
and an Orange M.P. in the chair; and the religi-
ous papers took him up with much enthusiasm.
And now, all of a sudden, the reverend Mac.
announces that he can’t stand the horrors of
Protestantism any longer, and has gone
back to the ould faith. He says that no
genuine holy Roman ever 'left the Church,
and he wouldn’t have done it only for the
dhrink, which seems to imply that no man who
isn’t drunk would be a Protestant—therefore all
Protestants are drunk and have to keep so to pre-
vent them falling away from their creed. Further,
Mr. M'Kernan withdraws a statement which he
published in the Protestant Standard that he
had conscientious scruples about Romanism, and
doesn’t seem to think much of the Standard’s
intelligence in printing it. He had hoped, he
said, to get enough money to take him away from
Australia, and as he is still in Australia it would
seem as if Protestants were a mean lot—or else
the reverend gentleman had to drink the takings
to drown his misery. We have received a copy of
Father Moike’s repentance rather badly written
on two sheets of crumpled paper, and witnessed
by a J.P., so we presume the affair is bona-fide.
There is no address upon it—possibly the repentant
father hasn’t an address and is sleeping in the
Domain—but wherever he is it is evident that
Father Mike is going to be a good Roman for the
future. Catholicism, after all, is a disease, and
so is Protestantism, and the person who has got
either of them very bad seldom recovers, unless
the microbes of the complaint are picked out of
him when he is young, and smashed with a big
Bible.
“Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness.”
One of the divine Commandments directs that
man shall not bear false witness against his
neighbour, and I regret that I should again find it
necessary to warn the public against designing and
dishonest impostors. In the first place “Clements
Tonic” does not mean “a Tonic” made by
“ Clements ” ! “ Clements Tonic ”is the name of
the remedy—it must have a name —but, because
the word Tonic appears, many ignorant people run
off with the erroneous idea that it is merely “a
tonic.” It is time that such fallacies were ex-
plained away. Again I state, Clements Tonic is
not a physic—but a food. It does not create an
appetite for food which the stomach can’t digest,
but, by enriching the blood, it increases the sup-
plies of pancreatic and gastric juices, and thus
enables the stomach to digest more food to supply
the wear and tear or destructive metabolism
which goes on throughout the human body every
moment of our lives from the cradle to the grave.
I want the public to know that the “Dyspeptic”
panaceas advertised with such plausible blarney
are only disguised cathartics, that the temporary
relief is only due to the purging, and not any per-
manent benefit can be derived. These nostrums
are simply commercial speculations, and are pre-
pared by men who never had an hour’s instruction
in, or study of, either pathology, pharmacology,
or therapeutics. Is it any reason because a man
has tried to be a shoemaker and failed that he is
qualified to treat disease ? If he can’t heel slices,
can he heal bodies? Does it stand to common
sense or reason that a man who has never had an
hour’s medical experience knows more about the
human body than men who have devoted their
whole lives and ability to the study of it and its
ailments. These lines are written in the interests
of sufferers and not in mine, it is no loss to me n
you spend your money or put your faith in in-
jurious preparations, and as far as Clements Tonic
is concerned, it stands on its own merits ; it has
grateful patrons in every city, town, and village,
and has lived down all opposition and calumny,
and is now the, standard of excellence and com-
pari-on, and is eulogised and recommended by
faculty, press, and public everywhere, and so long
as this is the case it has no cause to fear the base
misstatements of envious pirates, who one by one
get to Darlinghurst. Verb. Sap,

POLITICAL
POINTS
Rowland Rees, an ex-member of the S.A.
Assembly, whose conceit and oratorical ability are
both phenomenal, went down to listen to the
recent no-confidence motion and slept stretched at
full-length in the Speaker’s gallery, as a sort of
evidence of public contempt for the rhetorical
portion of the performance. , .
During the S.A. no-confldence debate,
Grainger pointed out that ex-Attorney-General
Homburg and ex-Commissioner for Public Works
Jenkins were only naturalised in South Australia,
and that both became aliens directly they crossed
the border of any of the other provinces. Jenkins
is a Yankee, and Homburg a German.
The new S.A. Ministry contains three
Scotchmen, an Irishman, and two Englishmen.
The Premier was an editor, the Chief Secretary is
a doctor, there are two lawyers, a shopkeeper,
and a squatter. Cockburn’s friends think he has
made a great mistake in joining the team, which is
by no means strong, but he put personal loyalty
to Holder above his duty to country and
principle.
The S.A. National Defence League (the
bogus “National” Association under another
name) put forth herculean efforts to keepßlayford
in office, and this induced all the Liberal members
to vote for Holder. Result : Humiliation for the
Ministry and its champions. The N.D.L. boasts
that it will turn local politics inside-out at the
April general election, and much money is being
spent with that object. It is, however, bound to
work “ upon the sly,” for the open advocacy of a
candidate’s cause would be fatal to his chances.
Horn, the wealthiest man in S.A.
Assembly, persuaded Treasurer Rounsvell to float
the recent instalment of Treasury Bills in
Adelaide by guaranteeing the whole issue
(<£1.20,000). He is now very disgusted because the
bills boomed and he was only alloted il!10,000,
while the balance of the money he had got ready
for the use of the State—at 4| per cent, interest-
had to remain unemployed and unprofitable for
several days. He would have voted against the
Government in revenge, but Holder daren't
promise him anything for fear of alienating the
labour members.
One Chaffers, a London tradesman, is
working himself to death in the endeavour to
XJ.S. Presidency—6 to 2 on Harrison.

The Government of Queensland is really
an absolute autocracy—tempered by Tom Glassey.
The Liberal bribe for the English elections
is that there are to be no peers in the next Cabinet.
The howl of wounded capitalism in now-
prospering Maoriland is sweet music to Australian
ears.
Griffith remarked in the House the other
n jo-ht that a few years’ holiday from political life
would suit him.
“ Several planters in the Bundaberg, Q.,
district have abandoned their contemplated exten-
sions pending the general election.” Hum !
Sqiiattophile Handyside’s inclusion in
Holder’s Ministry means the death of the pro-
gressive land-tax for the present S. A. Parliament.
S.A. political prophets declare that King-
ston will soon displace Holder as Premier, and
iiring a thoroughly radical team into office with
him.
Re Chief Justice Lilley’s recent letter :
Once slaves were bought and sold for the sake of
their labour ; now the labour of men is bought and
sold. _
The Bulletin is waiting to hear what Sir
Henry Norman has to say about his recent over-
land trip. Is he going to sing in chorus to
Kintore ''!
The Griffilwraith knew very well that he
could smash the proposed Kanakagemot. He
simply quibbled it to death. Maoriland only was
genuine in the business. The others bolted at the
first excuse.
What side do the parsons take in the
British elections? “ There are 65 parsons in onr
division,” remarked a Liberal candidate the other
day, “and hitherto there have been 63 against us
and two for us.”
Labour took £56,000 in wages out of the
gold-product of Mount Morgan during the last six
months. Capital got £150,000 in dividends as its
share. The Government was content with less
than £lO,OOO of the whole plunder.
Barring accidents, the Queensland Labour-
party may carry a dozen additional seats afc
next year’s general elections. The Burke and
Charters Towers are four dead certainties. Two
of the last four bye-elections “ went Labour.”
Stead says a change of the English Minis
try would do no good. True. Labour has nought
to hope from the Liberals, the smug, greasy, black-
coated workman-hating bourgeoisie, the glorious
middle class, so idolised by Gladstone and Bright.
John Moule, M.P. (S.A.), is the stormy
petrel of no-confidence motions. John has been
on hand to engineer the downfall of nearly every
Ministry for years past —yet he never gets office.
He vows vengeance against the new Ministry
which betrayed him.
Premier Shiels says the condition of the
starving unemployed makes his heart bleed. And
he does not talk only. He effectively bustles his
Ministers to find work, and has induced the Har-
bour Trust to hold its hand during winter over
the dismissal of 3l)0 men.
Queer that small-pox should swoop on
Melbourne just on the eve of discussion in Parlia-
ment about C om pulsory Vaccination, but never
theless it is believed that the provision will be
abrogated because N. S.W. (the paradise of quacks,
of all sorts) refuses to adopt it.
“ What has lulled the English people into
a false sense of security is that they have pre-
served the Throne and have preserved the aristo-
cratic Chamber.” This is an unintentional grain
of truth in two anti-democratic columns by
Howard Willoughby in a recent Argus.
The Bundaberg (Q.) Mail declares the
One-man-one-vote idea to - be “a socialistic and
damnable heresy.” Heresy is a word that is hard
to-define, but in a general sort of way it means
anything that interferes with the advertisement
revenue in a dreary editor’s butter-wrap.
The Chinese who are entering Queensland
from Port Darwin were brought out to do railway
work in the Northern Territory at threepence per

across to help MTlwraith and Co. to build their
transcontinental railway at threepence a day also !

B. D. Morehead says there would never
have been any unemployed in Queensland if the

wages. A fair rate of wages, he added, is what-

Two cable items from Sydney Tele-
graph ;
The idea of Mr. Dibbs seeking to instruct England as t
her fiscal policy, when he has only been in the country
three weeks, is ridiculed by the Economist.
The Economist disputes Mr. Dibbs’ assertion that New
South Wales was compelled to adopt a policy of I loiec-
tion.
Which simply means that the Economist objects
to Mr. Dibbs giving an opinion on English affairs
when he has been in England only three weeks, and
then it straightway proceeds to give an authorita-
tive opinion on Australian affairs though it has
never been in Australia at all. And the Sydney
Telegraph, in its haste to grovel to British
opinion, never notices the humour of the situation.
A few sentences selected from one week s
record in England, as an example of the utter-
brutality of British law —its grovelling reverence
for Property and its callous disregard of human
life and human suffering ;
Sarah Scratton, for stealing four flower-pots from a
nursery-gardener’s pile, one month s imprisonment. A
working-man, for a cowardly assault upon his wife, in
which she received injuries so serious that she had to be
removed to the hospital, also one month. A poor woman,
for stealing a shirt, nine months. (Mrs. Montague, for
slowly murdering her children by persistent cruelty, we
remember, got just three months more, and was “ spared
the indignity ” of prison garb.) A master builder, for a
brutal assault on his old mother, during which lie felled
her to the ground four times and knocked out two of her
teeth—fined £5 ! Jane Close, for stealing a purse con-
taining 4s. 6d., one year’s imprisonment. Peter Coleman
(ao-edlS), who was accused of taking three bricks from a
builder’s yard, 10 days, and five years in a reformaton ;
while a man, of highly respectable appearance, for “re-
volting cruelty” to his horse, fined £l. A ruffian who
showed his annoyance at a speech of his comrade’s by
calmly knocking out his eye, six weeks ; and James
Malliiisou, a collier, for stealing three bottles of spirits,
five years.
Premier Salisbury evidently begins to
realise that Government by Contradiction is a
failure. He says
We go to an election on several issues mixed up. Can
you imagine three trials taking place at once before the
same jury—let us say a trial for murder, a trial for libel,
and a trial of a patent case—and that the jury were only
allowed to say “ Yes” or “ No ” in one verdict, ami that
that verdict was to affect all three cases. That is
exactly the process by which a verdict is to be pronounced
upon the organic institutions of this country.
And that is the way verdicts will be pronounced
till the Referendum is adopted and party govern-
ment is abolished. So long as members go to the
country on a broad platform consisting of (say)
Freetrade, teetotalism, down with the Pope, the
flogging of garrotters, land reform, the extension
of the railway to Possum Flat, republicanism,
black labour, 'the building of a new gaol, and a
general desire to know where Parkes was when
the light went out, the voice of the people will
remain too much mixed up for general compre-
hension.
The A.M.P. Society’s bonus-certificate
form is only about the size of a bank-note, but the
certificates with the accompanying circular issued
for this one year alone weighed just about a ton-
and-a-half.
One of the objectionable things about the
Melbourne Harbour Trust is its association with
Militarism and Navyism. Republicans are vir-
tually excluded, and work is badly done through
the men getting off to all kinds of military
functions.
Martin (Sydney Post-Office) Place is once
more torn up, and, after a few months’enjoyment
of its broad expanse of expensive paving, pedes-
trians have again to jostle along the Post-Office
verandah. Who is responsible for the blunder in
the first place? How many thousands has this
imbecile business cost? Who is going to be
“sacked” over this monstrous waste of public
money ?
Somebody advertises in an English paper
that he “will exchange well-bred fox-terrier for
shower-bath and fittings.” This is another proof
that a man can’t keep himself clean by means of a
fox-terrier.
A copy of the printed proclamation calling
upon all “ loyal ” persons to “beaisy now ” at the
time of the Eureka trouble attracts a good deal of
attention in the window of a Oollins-street (Melb.)
tobacconist.
Sundry women in Gallicia have petitioned
the Emperor of Austria for permission to enter
the army, and state that they are as courageous
and as muscular as men, and altogether fitted for
military service. Probably they will get their
wish sooner or later, for the demand for soldiers
in Europe is unlimited. Moreover, a regiment of
hardened widows would be of great value in a
forlorn-hope, especially if they were roused to
madness by a voice from the other side of the
crumbling fortification, telling them that their
bonnets didn’t fit or that their false hair was
coming off. Then that regiment would get into
an irresponsible state, and would rush howling
over every obstruction with its dress bursting
down the'back and its bine spectacles flying in all
directions.
General Booth’s “benevolence.” At the
Salvation Army shelters in London, where the
homeless poor are taken in and cared for by kind
Christian friends in red shirts, this is the system.
If you can pay only a penny you are graciously
permitted to sit up on a form all night. If you
can pay twopence you are allowed to camp in a
sort of egg-box. If yon can't pay anything you
have to do fivepence worth of work at chopping
wood ; then you get one pennyworth of accommo-
dation on the form—the wood is sold for four*
nence —the Army makes threepence profit, and the
business of the regular wood-cutters is ruined by
the Salvation cheap competition. If you have no
money and are not able to chop wood you don’t
get in at all. A small building run on this plan
yields, in one way and another, about 100 per cent,
profit on the money laid out in rent and expenses,
and as the great, dull, imbecile British public
regards this swindle as a “benevolent under-
taking” it sends in its subscriptions into the
bargain—which are all clear profit.

good word for aristo-
cracy.

Dear Bulletin, —
Your “last-supper” yarn
of Odell, the almost un-
equalled raconteur of
London Savage Club,
who may or may not soon
visit Australia, is but
one of a thousand which
might be told of that
humorist. Some time, age
a well-known bore of the
class which is always
trying to rub shoulders
with well-known Bohe-
mians, was relating to
several men how his
brother, who had, from
his earliest years, given
proof of the possession
of exceptionally brilliant
powers, had unfortu-
nately fallen from a lad-
der, and so injured his
brain as to become almost
an idiot. He kept his
impatient listeners wait-
ing for fully a quarter-
of-an-hour whilst he re-
lated this melancholy in
cident. At last he con-
cluded, whereupon Odell,
who had patiently heard
it all, solemnly chipped
in, with* “ And now, old
fellow, tell us your own
sad story.’’—Yours, L.
London, 12th May, 1892.
A number of Richmond (Aic.) Thrift
electors succeeded in getting their names on the

“ The new halfpenny daily paper, The
Morning Leader,” writes our London corres-
pondent by last mail, “ will show oyer the horizon
before the end of this month. Opinions vary as to
the prospects of its ultimate success. It will be a
costly experiment, but the money is said to be all
right, and no expense will be spared in making
it really smart. It will proceed from the Star
office, and as it will no doubt be run on sound
Radical and Republican lines, it will be sure to
‘go,’for there is no thoroughly Radical daily in
London except the Star, and that does not com-
mand the same class of readers which a morning
paper would.”

She is of average height, with a good figure,

her, on their separation, a considerable slice,
which did not satisfy the fascinating grass-widow,

She used to keep a stylish boardinghouse in the

Perhaps it is better for poor little Lord
Ancram that he was shot. It would have been a
dreadful fate to live and be matrimonially pursued
by the “ barn-darncers.”
• # •
The news of Lord Ancram’s death, accord-
ing to one more or less bogus “cablegram,” was
received with deep sympathy in the House of
Commons —where probably not one man in ten
had ever heard of Lord Ancram, and not one in
150 had known him intimately.
* * *
The horse which Mr. Edwards, junior, was
riding, when Lord Ancram was shot, is the veteran
outlaw of the station, and is known as “ The
Demon.” It is related that some years ago Mr.
Edwards, sen., narrowly escaped a fate similar to
that of his late guest. While duck shooting a
fellow-sportsman fired unintentionally, and blew
into tatters the hat his host was wearing.

The Bulletin cannot congratulate the
Sydney daily papers, morning or evening, upon
their occasional illustrations. The literary gourmet
always declares that illustrations, however artistic,
spoil print, and certain it is that they detract
from that indefinable thing, the “dignity” of a
broad-sheet. Especially hideous were Sydney
D.T.’s recent pictures of a steeplechase, and of
Lord Ancram’s funeral, but it has been reserved
for Sydney Evening News to plumb the bottom
of the abyss with its drawing of the house wherein
someone murdered his wife the other day. Out-
side the door were shown two black daubs marked
“ X,” which referred you to the legend attached :
“X, pools of blood.” Why didn’t some mangy
dog lick up those pools of blood in the interests

“ What should we do without our Civil
Service stoah !” loudly remarked a high-toned fur-
bedecked woman to a friend she met in the Co-
operative shop in Pitt-street, Sydney, “ I always
ordah everything myself.” Then she turned to
the shopman and said : “ I want to see some nice
bacon, please.” After turning over all the pieces
on the stand she thought she would take “ one
pound.” “Out it in rashers, ma’am?” “No!
thank youindignantly. “ A pound and a
quarter,” said the man after weighing it. “That’s
rather moah than I requiab, but I will take it.”

A serious mortality is beginning among

is Deeraing’s dicky-bird, which was one among
the many items of evidence that led its ovyner to
the gallows. Solomon’s cat has eaten it. All
these things are omens, and now that the trouble

The recent S.A. political crisis might have
given Australia the smallpox scourge. Dr. Toll,
the health officer, was in quarantine, and the

infected passengers were allowed to mix with the

A fifteen-year-old girl, charged with steal-

Government House. Governor Sir Richard

Apropos the recent imprisonment of a cer-

thank Heaven, I have been chastened by the
Almighty, and stand before you a Christian.” A

The other night a swell concert was held
in Sydney. As it was an invitation affair the
audience assembled with praiseworthy punctuality,
and naturally the girl in the cloak-room thought
to gather a rich harvest from the much-bejewelled
Potts Pointers. They came, obtained her assist-
ance in putting themselves straight before enter-
ing, but quite omitted to leave any small coin in
the inviting receptacle provided for the purpose.
In fact, half the audience had departed ere one
lady with some remnants of conscience tendered a
humble shilling. “There!” said the hitherto'
meek damsel, smacking the coin on the table,
“ that’s the first I’ve taken to-night.” ft was ot
no avail, the remaining women decided that it
would only encourage her in impertinence if they
gave her anything for her services.
That girl was not half clever enough for her
business ; she should not have put an empty tray
on the table to invite remuneration, but should
have placed in it a judicious selection of shilling B
and half-crowns, with, perhaps, one modest halt'
sovereign. There’s nothing like a good example.
Young Lady, leave off sighing,

To engage.

Too respectable or rorty.

Fresh as roses dewy-petafled,
And on getting nicely settled
We are bent.

Little John F. Paterson, the artist, is off

“We are nae fou,” for the last, last time. Pater-

The residents of Portland (Yic.) have risen
as one man to object to the closing of their gaol.
The Government scheme of retrenchment includes,
the shutting-up of Portland chokee, inasmuch as
there are no local felons for the staff to work upon,
and no indications of a coming crime boom to
relieve the monotony. But rather than see the
shutters up at their skilly-shop, the townspeople
are prepared to receive a draft of “ old and harm-
less prisoners ” from Melbourne and elsewhere,
and the other day a deputation waited upon the
Chief Secretary to ask him whether he couldn’t
send along a consignment of decayed ruffians as
desired. The suggestion was coldly received, how-
ever, so unless Portland is prepared to pay a large
premium for the imported article, and stock the
cells “regardless,” there will shortly be a com-
modious lock-up to let in that peaceful district.

the saint’s person the fire-place, then lugged
him forth, formeti a scrum with him over the

twisting bis head off in the process. Then he
bustled the corpse under the bed and when help
arrived the tussle had degenerated into a dog-
fight, and the footballer was in the act of chewing
his enemy’s ear.

The love that can survive youth and
beauty is a holy emotion ; you don’t find it often,

travels a hundred miles or so, only to get a

The Temuka (M.L.) Leader mentions
that a young woman has just taken up a selection
in the Waimate district with her own savings, and
remarks enthusiastically that she is the sort of
female to make a good wife, as she is economical
and “can offer a home to the man who marries
her.” Any homeless young man who has been
deceived and who wants to be taken in out of the
wet would doubtless be glad to meet a girl of this
sort. For our own part, we have known one
female farmer, and that was enough. She used to
get up early in the morning and kill pigs, and she
was a demon at digging post-holes, and for urging
along an exhausted horse in a mud-cart we never
knew her equal. She was a kind-hearted person
all the same, but her muscles were enormous, and
she had a roll in her gait through plodding over
ploughed fields, and when we saw her holding a
horse by the hair with a mighty grasp and blow-
ing medicine down his throat, it made us shudder.
Ultimately she seized upon a lazy, harmless, good-
looking man and bestowed her horny hand upon
him at the altar; she was an affectionate wife,
but she made her husband get up at four in the
morning, and he caught cold in the damp grass
and died after one short year’s happiness. His
widow wept bitterly over his grave, and then
went home and put the old cow’s feet in hot
water. The very last we saw of her she w r as a
powerful old woman of 40, and was shoving a calf
by main force over a fence, while her daughter
(aged 12), who evidently inherited her mother’s
virtues, was scrubbing four rooms and a passage,
and putting the clothes in soak for a day’s wash-
ing. There had been twin daughters originally,
but the other one caught a fatal complaint when
helping to dig potatoes in her eleventh year.

Melbourne Y.M.C.A. is in grave financial
difficulties. Goldbug and Giltgore panned out
liberally with the lucre, in boom time, when the
new Y.M.C.A. temple was put up, but their game
is played out, wherefore they draw in their horns.
A miserable exhibition of religion, used as a
stalking horse, to inveigle the wealthy old women
into banks and building societies.
GOOD NEWS FOR VICTORIA.
Be not afraid ! it wasn’t true,
That agitating story—
Great Tulloch still will draw his screw
For Hingland, Home and glory ;
Although his force of men at arms
Be rapidly declining,
He’ll stop and dream of war’s alarm i
He doesn’t mean resigning.
Ho can’t abear to cry “Retrench ’’
And see his braves disbanding ;
He thinks the Russians or the French
Must very soon be landing ;
He scoffs at blank civilian snobs
(Especially when dining),
But though his heart with anger throbs,
He doesn’t mean resigning.
’Tis Tulloch’s biz. to shed the gore
Of all invading strangers,
And though he can’t create a war,
He must exist—on “ dangers,”
So while His Nibs can raise a staff
Though bitterly repining,
You bet your life—it makes us laugh—
He doesn’t mean resigning.
A FANCY.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When sunset halls are all aglow
With subtle tints divine.
Her face is near me. then I know,
Her hands are clasped in mine.
And all the warmth of sunlit seas,
The glow of ardent skies,
Are cold beside the sympathies
That light her wond’rous eyes.
A soothing peace her presence gives,
A radiant, tranquil rest;
She knows the deep turmoil that lives
Within my troubled breast.
She knows the wounds that bleed and smart,
Her touch, her kiss, is balm,
She whispers, “Oh, thou restless heart,
lie calm awhile, be calm ! ”
She soothes my brow, her gentle palms
Are soft upon my hair—
Oh, then, I stretch my wistful arms,
And—gather empty air.

A Funny Game.
A few friends met the other night in a Newtown
store to spend a jovial evening, but as they were
all teetotallers and none of them drank anything
stronger than Clements Tonic, drunkenness was
out of the question. Mac. proposed a game
at euchre, and Jones said they had better play for
something just to give the game an interest and
make it lively, but times were hard, so they did
not care to play for money. Smith, however,
spied a box of Fletcher's bilious and liver pills,
and proposed that each time a man was beaten he
should take a pill, and this made the game lively
and the fun was fast and furious. Simpson
swallowed five, Jones got away with four and
Smith and Hopkins two each and Mac. got off
scot free. The game terminated by a general
exodus at 3 a.m., for Dr. Fletcher’s pills never
labour in vain. They are the best and mildest
pills made and are sold by all chemists and
druggists everywhere; being a positive, safe,
and reliable cure for constipation, liver complaint,
headache, &c. They always give satisfaction.
The proprietors give away £5O (in seven prizes) at
Xmas, for the seven first nearest guesses sent in,
as to how many of these pills a large Clements
Tonic bottle (now full) holds. A guess form is
around every box, and all such forms are eligible
for this competition that come from around a box.
One box of Fletcher’s Pills proves their virtues
and they can be obtained everywhere at Is., or
post free 13 penny stamps, from F. M. Clements,
Newtown, N.S.W.

HOW SHE DOES IT
TO watch a woman despatching her letters by
mail is a highly interesting study. In the
matter of dropping a simple, white, ordinary,
every-day letter, for instance, she affords an
admirable insight into the character of the average
female. Filled with this thought, like as a Labour
Member in parliament with his own importance
we yesterday placed ourselves on duty in a con-
venient spot for observation, near the receipt of
mails. A sedate-looking young lady shortly put
in an appearance. She ' took a letter from a
reticule, which had not been built to accommodate
much more than a society envelope and a postage
stamp, and then suddenly discovered that the
stamp was somewhere else. An exhaustive search
revealed its whereabouts, and having licked it in
two sections and affixed it to the well-wetted right
hand corner of the envelope, she proceeded to-
wards the slot. Her fingers, however, refused to
relax their grip upon the precious message, and
she withdrew it hesitatingly to scan both sides
and be very sure it was securely sealed and
properly addressed, and to be certain that no
inquisitive eye could gleam a hint of its contents
through the cover. Then she “lets it drop,”
which is just what the doctors do when they find
that a case of rheumatism, sciatica, gout, or
neuralgia is beyond their power, and they find
themselves forced to admit that they “can do
nothing more.” But if they can’t, St.” Jacobs Oil
can, a fact which Mr. Risby, of King-street, New-
town, near Sydney, emphasises as follows: “I
have been a crcat sufferer from rheumatism, and
have spent a large sum in doctors’ bills, in addition
to trying nearly every specific I could hear of, but
have never found anything but St. Jac-*-s Oil to
give me relief.”

“German
Syrup”
The majority of well-read phys-
icians now believe that Consump-
tion is a germ disease. In other
words, instead of being in the con-
stitution itself it is caused by innu-
merable small creatures living in the
lungs having no business there and
eating them away as caterpillars do
the leaves of trees.
The phlegm that is
coughed up is those
parts of the lungs
which have been
gnawed off and destroyed. These
little bacilli, as the germs are called,
are too small to be seen with the
naked eye, but they are very much
alive just the same, and enter the
body in our food, in the air we
breathe, and through the pores of
the skin. Thence they get into the
blood and finally arrive at the lungs
where they fasten and increase with
frightful rapidity. Then German
Syrup comes in, loosens them, kills
them, expells them, heals the places
they leave, and so nourish and
sootLfe that, in a short time consump-
tives become germ-proof and well. ®

MIMERLESS BREECH-LOADING SHOT GUN. —ONLY 2 POUNDS.
The PEERLESS HAMMERLESS GUN is our latest
offer to the Colonial public and the most marvellous
value we have ever presented for the money.
A RAPID LOADER, CLOSE SHOOTER, HARD
HITTER, and for general utility, equal to guns cost-
ing TEN POUNDS or more. Can only be bought
direct from us, or our authorised agents. Very finely
finished, browned barrel, and walnut stock, with
steel heel-plate, perfect ejectors, and hammer-
less action, lateral breech, no awkward breaking
gear, can be loaded instantaneously, no jamming of
cartridges, never misses or hangs fire.
These guns' are. WITHOUT DOUBT, the
CHEAPEST and BEST ever sold. We have
obtained control of the market, and as the supply is
limited, request customers to order early to avoid
delay and disappointment.
In order to ensure confidence in these guns
we guarantee to refund the money after a trial
If gun proves unsatisfactory, and also to pay
return carriage ourselves.
These guns could never be sold for double the
amount, if it were not that we wish them to be a great
advertisement for us.
THOUSANDS ARE NOW IN USE IN ENGLAND.
Hammerless guns are fast displacing the old style,
for the reason that the absence of hammers is safer
offering no obstacle to catch in bush, &c., to send gun-
off accidentally, and also affording a quicker sight,,
which is very essential in snap shooting.
Specially adapted for Rabbit, Duck, Kangaroo
and Wallaby shooting.
TWELVE BORE ONLY. SINGLE BARREL ONLY.
The cheapest breechloader sold heretofore was at
least double the price of this gun, and we say
positively, much inferior.
The barrel and action of the Peerless gun are of
European manufacture and have formerly been rifle
barrels, and of quite as good quality of metal as the
most expensive gun in use, being manufactured
directly under government supervision, and only
passed after most severe tests.
The boring and chambering have been done with
the one view of hard hitting and close shooting. So
simple and compact is the action, that we assert it to
be almost an impossibility for them to get out of order.
. CARRIAGE PAID. Only &2. Send£2
for the Cheapest Gun in Australia, Postal Notes,
Money Order, Cheque, or Registered Letter.
If your order is received not later than Oct. Ist,
1892, we will give Gratis with each gun, a set of
Loading Tools, retailed at 3s 6d.

FOR
Mother Aubert's Remedies.
Another Bishop Confirms their Efficacy.
The demand during the past month shows they
are now fully established as the chief proprietary
medicine of New Zealand.
The chemists everywhere speak of them as the
most successful remedies ever introduced.
• ■ ' DIPHTHERIA.
This troublesome complaint is at the present
time working haVoc throughout New Zealand.
“ MARUPA”
Has been tried for this, and is giving every satis-
faction to those who have used it. It is almost
impossible to realise the value of a medicine such
as Marupa is.
At the first symptoms of DIPHTHERIA, send
for a bottle of Marupa, and confirm the useful-
ness of this remedy.
This is the season when nearly everyone suffers
from hoarseness, sore throats and colds in the
heads.
“MARUPA ”
Can relieve all these complaints, and is a medicine
which should be kept in every
household.
Christchurch,
March 24th., 1892.
Dear Sir, —I am informed that you are about
to visit Sydney and Melbourne^in the interests of
the Mother Mary Joseph Remedies.
I need hardly say that I wish you every success
in your undertaking. At the same time I must
thank you for the samples you kindly sent me.
I must say that I found what I took most
beneficial, and from what I have heard wherever
I have been in New Zealand, these remedies are
looked upon as marvellous in their effects.
I feel sure, when known, they will be equally
appreciated in Australia.
I am,
Yours faithfully,
J. J. Crimes,f

Mr. O. I. Kempthorne.
Mother Mary Joseph Aubert’s name is now a
household one, and the Remedies are being taken
by persons in every sphere of life.
New Zealand can produce as reliable remedies
for sickness and dise'ases as any part of the world,
and we can go further to say that in its vegetation.,
we believe, no country on the face of the globe has
been so bountifully supplied by Nature. Why
then, should the public ask for and use imported
medicines, when they can get them as good, if not
better, in the country which supports them ?
Nature has given us benefits —let us make the
best use of them. The Rev. Mother has just been
on a visit to Wellington, and brought down a
large supply from Jerusalem (on the Wanganui
River), and it has been a pleasure to see this lady’s
face beaming with smiles with the knowledge
that her thirty years’ assiduous experiments,
without fee or reward, have now the appreciation
of the general public. It must indeed be said
that she has proved herself a wonderful woman,,
toiling on for this length of time with the one
motto (“ Excelsior”) always before her. Many a.
fond parent during last month has cause to be
thankful that such a remedy as Marupa lias been
offered, as there has been a very prevalent
epidemic of whooping cough, and its effects on a
large number of children have been simply
marvellous.
Paramo will hold its own as one of the best
Kidney and Liver Cures in existence.

English caste is more rigid than the

Mr. J. M‘lutyre, of Brisbane, the con-
tractor for the supply of telegraph-messengers’
uniforms, writes to po nt out that his price is not
30s. per suit below that of the former contractor
as stated by a correspondent of The Bulletin,
the reduction being a few pence only—that the
youths do not look like “scarecrows or bell-
bottomed larrikins ” —and that the material is
good hnd passed a rigorous inspection before being
accepted. Also he mentions that the supply of
these uniforms has hitherto been a monopoly, and
that this is the first occasion when tenders have
been called for and the business done on a system
of fair and open competition. These statements
are duly endorsed by the Brisbane papers.
The natural beauties of scenery in our
“Beautiful Harbour,” National Park, &e., have
so often been depicted by the artist’s brush as to
be tolerably well-known and appreciated, and
many a fortunate possessor looks with pride at his
pictures of the glorious scenery of sunny New
South Wales. Unfortunately, we are not all
endowed with artistic propensities and cannot use
the brush tj faithfully copy nature: this, how-
ever, in this enlightened age, is only a very slight
drawback, as the wonderful perfection that photo-
graphy has been brought to of late years makes it
a very easy matter to obtain pretty souvenirs of
pleasant journeys. Armed with a small camera,
the tourist can photograph the charming scenes s >
frequent in the numerous excursions around
Sydney, and thus secure lasting impressions of
many a happy day spent ’mid sunshine, flowers,
and ferns. Messrs. Baker & Rouse, of 375 George-
street, Sydney, make it their special duty to
supply the amateur with the necessary apparatus,
and for a ridiculously low price ; they are now :
showing a great variety of cameras, &c., and a
visit to their warehouse will well repay intending
purchasers.

i The secret cipher used in the Twenties and
Ihirties by the British Foreign Office was re-
garded as insoluble without the key. It was
arranged by Jerdan, the journalist, editor of the
long-since-defunct Literary Gazette. He in-
vented it in response to a jocular challenge issued
at a supper-party by Wylde, afterwards Lord
Chancellor. At the party was also present
another young barrister, Wylde’s brother, who
was Judge-Advocate of N.S.W. before the estab-
lishment of the new Charter of Justice. The
latter Wylde obtained a copy of the cipher to
solve, but, failing to do so, put the paper aside.
Years afterwards, during Mr. Commissioner
Bigge’s visit to N.S.W., at a dinner given at
Government House, the conversation turned upon
cryptographs. Macquarie said that Michael
Robinson, his Emancipist clerk, undertook to
decipher any code. Wylde subsequently tested
Robinson’s knowledge on Jordan’s invention, and
the ex-convict supplied a reading which, at a later
day, Wylde submitted to Jerdan, who declared it
coincided with his key. Robinson died without
knowing he had caused a flutter in official circles
at “home.” Robinson used to supply convicts,
for a consideration, with secret codes.
Says a leading Maoriland lawyer :—“ If I
were being tried for a criminal offence and had
my choice, I should ask for a jury if guilty, but if
innocent would prefer a judge alone. No judge,
I think, would ever convict an innocent man, but
a jury often lets a guilty one off. ” In connection
with which view he tells the following to a Bul-
letin correspondent:—“Some years ago, about
14 perhaps, I was engaged to defei d a man
charged with arson. To my mind it v. a? the one
absolutely clearly-proved case of this crime I have
met in my legal career, but I did my best for my
client and pulled the prosecution about as much
as possible. At last came the summing-up, dead
against the prisoner, and the jury, a most ‘con-
victing ’ lot, retired. We expected every minute
to see them return with a verdict of guilty, but
for four hours they remained locked up with-
out deciding. At the end of that time
they filed into Court to ask the judge ‘if
he would kindly go over the crucial points
on which their verdict should rest.’ This
he did, and the points were dead against me, upon
which the jury were about to again retire, when I
jumped to my feet, saying, ‘lf your Honor will
permit, I woidd like to say you have shown the
jury all there was against the prisoner, but nothing
for him.” ‘ TFas there anything for him, Mr. C.?’
blandly replied the judge. ‘Yes,’ I returned,
and, facing the listening twelve, ticked off on my
fingers impressively all I could think of. Five
minutes after the jury came in with a verdict of
‘Not Guilty,’ and the judge was so dumbfounded
he could hardly find breath to discharge the
prisoner, who gaily skipped out of court, and in
less than twenty-four hours was on his way to
Sydney by steamer, not even waiting to try and
get his insurance, which he abandoned.’ ‘ But
your costs?’ exclaimed a listener to the above.
‘Oh ! my costs,’ with a grin, ‘ I got those before I
went into Court.' ”

A Marvellous Triumph Over Disease .
Jl
mm
The Greatest Health-
Restoring Remedy
Yet Discovered.
The Best Preventive and Blood Purifier in the World. The treatment is unfolded in the HEALTH PAMPHLET, a prescription of 48 pages. Price, posted, £l. Many thousands who have
purchased the pamphlet would not give up the use of the treatment for all the money in the world.
ni WITHOUT J? 1
MBDICINTB.
Du. Hall says ; Let it be distinctly understood
that tliis is no scheme of quackery to draw money
out of the afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent
medicine humbug, since there is not a grain of
medicine of any kind required in the treatment.
Notwithstanding this fact it takes directly hold of
the worst cases of dyspepsia, liver complaints,
headaches, constipation, heart disease, incipient
consumption, diabetes and Bright’s disease of the
kidneys, including fevers and inflammation of the
lungs, and of other internal organs—not by
attacking these so-called diseases directly, but by
radically neutralising and removing their causes,
thus allowing nature herself to do her work unim-
peded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation, without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to which will not be
affected favourably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this pamphlet we are obliged to require
a “Pledge of Honour” from those purchasing it
not to show or reveal its contents outside of their
own families. This is for our own protection, and
as the only means by which our just rights in this
discovery can be maintained. Doctors, of course,
who purchase are not debarred from using the
treatment in their own practice, providing they do
not show the pamphlet or do not reveal the
rationale of the treatment.
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., Was the first
M.D. to whom we revealed the new treatment-
more than twenty years ago. In writing to a
friend, about a year ago, he gives the following ;
. . . “ Nearly twenty years ago, in this city,
Dr. A. Wilford Hall gave me privately a detailed
history of a hygienic treatment he had discovered
and adopted some twenty years before, and which
he had practised continuously upon himself up to
that time. The history included an account of
the failure of his health, the reasonings and con-
clusions which led him to adopt the treatment, his
rapid restoration to health, &o. From the time
of his first mention of it to me I have been
entirely satisfied that it has saved him from a
lingering consumption and death. I learn that he
has persistently continued the treatment to the
present time —forty years in all—and that his
present health and vigorous condition may right-
fully be compared to the ‘ bloom of youth,’ though
he is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in
my practice in the twenty years past have con-
vinced me that great practical benefit will be
derived by members of the medical profession and
others from a careful study of the rationale of the
treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the details
of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely be due him
for whatever scientific advances he may be able to
unfold in the line of assisting nature to ward off
disease, and in the restoration of health. —R. F,
Stevens, M.D.”
Dr. Jesse Huestis, of Columbus, Ohio, referred
to in our personal statement in April Microcosm
as the second M.D. to whom the new treatment
was revealed, writes to a brother physician who
had inquired of him concerning the Pamphlet
“ You need have no doubt concerning the merits
of the new treatment. I consider Dr. Hall’s
statements as true in every particular, He has in
my opinion made the most valuable discovery of
this or any other age for the purpose of combating
diseased action in the human system, be the type
what it may. ... I consider the price merely
nominal when compared with the inestimable
value of the discovery. It is just as accessible to
everybody under his method of selling it, by first
requiring a pledge of honour, as would be a
doctor’s prescription, for which he might charge
the same price. In both cases the remedy is free
to all who are willing to pay for it. . . . It is
without doubt the true secret of longevity, and is
as valuable to those in health as in sickness, pro-
moting sound sleep, perfect alimentation, freedom
from weariness under exertion, and a sure protec-
tion of the circulation from impurities.—J.
Huestis, M.D.”

Mr. Hern, Dr. Hall’s Agent.
Dear Sir.—l have been a sufferer for the last
thirty years from Bile and Bilious Headaches,
and have tried almost everything, and obtained
no relief, all the doctors’ treatments having failed.
I began to think I should never be better. I was
advised to try Dr. Hall’s Hygienic Cure, and the
result is marvellous. Mine being a very serious
case, having suffered so long, I had to be very
careful. But now I feel twenty years younger
than when I commenced the treatment. I have
applied it three times a week for the first two
months, and twice a week since, and am now as
free from all signs of biliousness as though I had
never been troubled with it. It is with the
greatest gratitude I express my thankfulness for
the cure.—Yours truly, Joseph Harrison, nut
and bolt maker at Carlton Foundry, Leioester-
street, Melbourne.
Nicholson-street, Footscray, 13th April, 1892.
Mr. J. Hern. —Dear Sir. — I am delighted to
give my testimony for what Dr. Hall’s No-Medi-
cine Treatment has done for my distressed body
during the last seven weeks. I have been a great
sufferer for the last eight years from Rheumatics
in all my nerves, Neuralgia and constant-recur-
ring serious Bilious Attacks, with most distress-
ing Headaches. During the last five years I had
lost the use of my arms, and was almost drawn
double with pain. I suffered constantly most tor-
turing agonies of pains all over my body; God
only knows my dreadful sufferings. I placed my-
self in the hands of eight doctors, and for four
months was under one of the best herbalists in
Melbourne. I had tried almost every remedy, and
taken bucketfuls of various drugs and patent
medicines. I took Seigel’s Syrup twice every day
for over a year, also 11 bottles of Warner's Safe
Cure, four large bottles of Clements’ Tonic, and
still I was getting seriously worse, and thought
my end very near; but for my loved ones I would
have been glad to have died. May God bless Mr.
Hobbs of this city for calling and telling me what
wonders Dr, Hall’s new cure had done for him in
a few days ! Seven weeks ago, when I procured
Dr. Hall’s Health Pamphlet from you, I was get-
ting rapidly worse, and had lost all hope of being
better. My husband and I were astonished at the
wonderful new discovery disclosed in the book. X
at once determined to give over everything else and
give it a fair trial. I have carefully carried out
the directions, which are easy and simple: and
now what it has done for me is most marvellous.
I cannot find words to express all the praises it
deserves. From helplessness, seven weeks ago,
I am up at a quarter to six every morning doing
my household duties, lam really almost like a
now creature. I used to be kept awake night after
night with pain. Now my night's rest is enjoy-
able. My biliousness, sick headache and neuralgia
have for ever gone; the store people and neigh-
bours are amazed to see me out tripping about in
the morning and looking so well. I would not
give up the use of Dr. Hall’s treatment for all the
money in the world. My statement can be corro-
borated by several storekeepers in Nicholson-street.
—Very truly yours,- M. C, Cd'Hbkkt-on.
Mephan Ferguson, Esq., Engineer, Leicester-
street, Melbourne, 23rd April 1892. Dr. Wilford
Hall’s Agent, 5 Gertrude-street, Fitzroy. Dear
Sir,—While in America, about eight months ago,
I purchased one of Dr. Hall’s Health Pamphlets,
and as I had previously experienced attacks of
Giddiness, etc., I determined to put the treat-
ment into immediate and practical application. I
had no difficulty in applying it, and to say that I
was surprised at the truly wonderful results
following its adoption, would only be expressing
myself mildly. In fact I was astounded. Since
then I have recommended all my friends to give
it a trial, and have had the satisfaction of seeing
several of them follow my advice, with the most
beneficial results in every case. lam still recom-
mending it to every sufferer I meet, and will con-
sider it my duty to do, until your Health Pamphlet
will be so widely known that it will be a crime to
be ill. You may depend on my doing all in my
power for the sake of suffering humanity to spread
abroad your wonderful little work. There is no
beating about the bush with it; it is plain, con-
cise, and can readily be understood and put into
practice by anyone. The first cost is the only one,
and that is indeed trifling considering its great
value. I still continue the treatment, and am
attaining a perfect state of health and vigour,
altogether Unhoped for. My friends notice my
changed appearance, and I can truly say that
since 1 began your treatment I am a different
man.—Yours very truly, Mephan Ferguson.
Station-street, Moreland, Coburg, 28th March)
1892. Mr. J. Hern. Dear Sir, —I believe that I
would render a good service to poor, suffering
humanity by giving a true statement of what Dr.
Hall’s Hygienic treatment has done for me. I
have been a great sufferer for the last ten
years from Rheumatism and a complication
of other ailments. My sufferings have been
very fearful at times from the crown of
my head to the sole of my foot. On a sudden
cold change in the weather it would cause a great
lump to rise on each side of my head, and so
severe was the pain 1 could only move with
greatest care. I had suffered so much and so long,
and took so much iodine and potash, and bushels
of various kinds of drugs, enough to kill a horse,
until my system was fairly poisoned throughout.
I felt and looked old and miserable at forty-two,
and I felt sure that the beginning of the end had
commenced with me. My veins were knotted,
and I told my doctor that I felt paralysis setting
in on me, which it proved to be. At this critical
juncture, through a neighbour’s persuasion, who
had rapidly been cured through Dr. Hall’s treat-
ment of a serious attack of Influenza, I obtained
a Dr. Hall’s Pamphlet from you, and now, after
five months’ use of the wonderful “ no medicine ”
cure, 1 feel like a young man at twenty. My
constitution has been renovated and brought into
first-class working order by my blood being made
pure. Life now is enjoyable. Words cannot
express all that ought to be said in favour of this
hygienic, health-restoring process, which, I am
sure, stands unrivalled in the world. If I had it
before I got ill it would have saved me from all
my suffering and a large amount of money. lam
perfectly sure of that. I have received enough
benefit from the time I have used it to assure you
that I would not take all the money in Australia
and be without it.—Very truly yours, T. A.
Thompson.
Victoria Foundry, 7,9, and 11 Victoria-street’
Carlton, Melbourne, 14th April, 1892. I was very
incredulous about your cure when I first heard
about it, but having been induced to try it, I now
gladly testify that I have derived much benefit
from its use, and have myself recommended it to
others, with equally good results to them. I
regard the amount I paid as money well laid out.
—Yours respectfully, William Phillips.
614 Little Collins street, Melbourne. —Mr. J.
Hern. Dear Sir, —During the last nine years I
have suffered greatly from my liver (sometimes
seriously congested), bile, indigestion, headaches,
and the discharge of a lot of phlegm that gave me
great trouble to clear up. I have tried nearly all
the best remedies, and was under a supposed
clever specialist treatment of massage, combined
with homoeopathic medicines, for twelve months,
and was worse than when I commenced with it,
through my liver being so bad and taking so much
drugs. It has changed the colour of my skin to
nearly half black. I have been using Dr. Hall’s
remedy three times a week for the last four
months, and it has bad a wonderful health-restor-
ing effect on me. I have not taken a drop of
medicine or drugs since I commenced it, and I
have not felt my liver since, and all my complaints
are gone. Life now has a new experience. I con-
sider the pamphlet a priceless gem.—Yours truly,
N. Pristner.
Chancery-lane, Melbourne, March 20, 1892.
Mr. Hern. Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in
testifying to the splendid results obtained by using
Dr. Hall’s remedy. I have found it a complete
success. I suffered all last year from chronic
nervous weakness, which so debilitated my liver
and kidneys that I was very greatly reduced. I
was under the care of a clever doctor, but imme-
diately I ceased the remedies the affliction ap-
peared again. lam better now in every way. My
digestion, which was bad, is improving daily ; my
kidney complaint is wonderfully better, and it has
cured me entirely of obstinate constipation of a
very bad form. The logic of the system is irre-
futable. lam highly recommending it to all my
friends. I am still using it, and have not the
slightest doubt that it will finally leave me in as
healthy a state as it is possible for me to attain
to.—C.R. [This gentleman objects to having his
name published, but it will be given to anyone
desiring it.]
Dr. James Robertson, of Birmingham, England,
repeats his former endorsement as follows,
February 14: “Dear Dr. Hall, —It will be but
justice to you and may save me answering many
private letters of inquiry if I now give you my
rather extensive 12 months’ experience of your
new treatment. As at first recognised, the general
idea is a brilliant one, physiologically sound, and
1 now add —all criticism notwithstanding—so far
as 1 can see, it is thoroughly original. In practice,
when intelligently carried out, it meets directly
the immediate wants of a large majority of the
ailing and suffering public ; it sharpens the
appetite, stimulates the liver, lightens the labour
of the kidneys, moves the bowels; by so doing it
strengthens the back, clears the brain, gives spring
to body and mind, chases away bilious melancholy
with its legion of neuralgia, spasms, and pains,
and comes altogether as ‘a boon and a blessing hi
men.’ Personally I have benefited much by it,
and when I find a patient with sense to use it
thoroughly, I can dispense with medicine and
attend to hygiene, the true province of the doctor.
I cannot withhold my testimony in favour of what
I know to be simple, natural, and good, a power-
ful defence to the healthy, and the best remedial
process I know of, even in cases of serious organic
disease. You may challenge the world, medical
or general, to name a process of such widely
applicable remedial power. —Faithfully yours,
James Robertson.
Rev. W. P. Hall (no relative of Dr. Hall), of
Point Peninsula, N.Y., writes: “Dr. Hall.
Dear Sir, —I have just answered a letter from
Utah Territory. A friend wished to know if my
testimonial was given correctly in the Microcosm.
I answered yes; that it was true to the letter, and
that my endorsement was nowhere nearly as strong
as I could now truthfully make it. I told him
that your treatment had cured me of rheumatism,
kidney disease, catarrh, and other complications
of disease, so that from crutches and helplessness,
I am now as well and free from disease as fifty
years ago. I have already received and answered
more than sixty letters from all parts of the
country, re-affirming the truth of my testimonial,
and I will gladly answer one hundred times sixty
if thereby I can induce sufferers to try your treat-
ment, as I declare before God my unfaltering con-
viction, both from my own experience and obser-
vation in numerous cases, that your discovery, if
properly used and persevered in, will cure any
form of curable illness that flesh is heir to. lam
ready now to proclaim to all men unreservedly
that your treatment, as set forth in your Health
Pamphlet, and without drugs of any kind, is the
healing balm for the afflicted that is capable of
supplying health to everV suffering son and
daughter of Adam. Let me know how I can serve
you, and command me freely.—Your friend grate-
‘fully, W. P. Hall.”
180 Rosslyn-street, West Melbourne, April 11,
1892. To Mr. J. Hern, Fitzroy. Dear Sir, —It
gives me the greatest pleasure to give my testi-
mony to the wondei’ful curative power of Dr.
Wilford Hall’s hygienic treatment. During the
last seven years I have been a sufferer from indi-
gestion, and a complication of other diseases, but
during the last three years, and up to the day I
commenced to apply your hygienic treatment, my
suffering at times was very great, almost unbear-
able. Not being able to get sufficient sleep, I
became very depressed. I had consulted four
Melbourne doctors, whose remedies gave me no
lasting benefit, though I had taken a large quan-
tity of drugs and patent medicines. I have been
applying Dr. Hall’s new treatment a little over
two months. Indigestion is no trouble to me now ;
scarcely feel it; I can enjoy my food and sleep
soundly. I have increased 121 b. in-weight. The
new cure has been a real God-send to me. It has
made life now enjoyable. My wife and I are
spreading the good news all we can.—Yours sin-
cerely, E. Reading.
A minister in Melbourne writes : —“ My father
and I are speaking to the afflicted wherever we go
of the merits of the treatment you represent, and
will continue to do so. . . . As for my poor
brother, poor fellow, would we had applied the
treatment to him three months ago; I feel sure he
would have been living to-day.”
From the Rev. Samuel Knight, Prahran Wes
leyan Parsonage. Dear Sir, —I feel confident that
your Hygienic treatment would assist weak and
slow digestion, kidney derangement, impurity of
the blood, and that it would promote longevity.
In many cases I believe it would make life a new
experience. People who fly to nostrums would be
saved from much mischief by indiscriminate use
of medicines.—l am, dear sir, yours truly, S.
Knight.
From T. W. Rashleigh, Manager, Spectator
Publishing Co. Ltd., Melbourne :
“ Dear Sir, —I have used Dr. Hall’s remedy for
some months with beneficial effect. I have also
answered a great number of letters of inquiry
from friends, to all of whom I have been able,
without hesitation, to recommend the treatment
for almost any disease. This remedy is not a new
quack cure, but a genuine and simple thing that
must commend itself to the intelligence of every
person who uses it. It has accomplished wonders
for many of my acquaintances in this city.”
Charles Birch, of El Dorado Springs, Mo.,
writes 18th January, 1892 :
“Dear Dr. Hall,—l bought one of your Health
Pamphlets about two weeks ago, and have been
practising the Hygienic treatment daily since. I
have doctored for years, and no doctor ever
helped me or could tell what ailed me, and I
myself did not know until this morning, when I
passed about one quarter of a pint of gall stones.
Now, I would not take all I am worth and give up
the use of your treatment, for it has done me so
much good.— l remain, yours truly, Charles
Birch.”
And hundreds of others.
To Ladies.
Dr. Hall’s treatment has wrought wonders in
completely restoring to a perfect state of health
several well-known ladies that the best medical
skill in Victoria could not cure. Some of them
had old-standing and very serious complaints.
They are willing to give any ladies their personal
testimony, or by letter, but they object to their
names being published. Names given on applica-
tion to the agent.
One of them writes, April 14, 1892: “ Mrs.
Hern, Dear Madam,—l object to my name being
published, but you may refer any lady to me, and
I shall bo glad to personally testify to the great
benefit I have derived from Dr. Hall’s treatment.
I also think that one personal testimony is worth
a thousand published ones.”
I
Rev. Mr. Berber's wife writes from Bonny Doon,
Victoria: —“ It is wonderful the relief the treat-
ment gives my husband. He finds great good
from it. He has much improved during the last
fortnight. We are thorough believers in it.”

DR. HALL SAYS;
Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of
any kind required in the treatment. Notwith-
standing this fact, it takes directly hold of the
worst cases of dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, constipation, heart disease, incipient con-
sumption, diabetes, and Bright's disease of the
kidneys, including fevers and inflammation of the
lungs, and of other internal organs—not by attack-
ing these so called diseases directly, but by radically
neutralising and removing their causes, thus
allowing nature herself to do her work unimpeded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation, without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to which will not be
affected favourably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
In Carbine’s Cup, Dreadnought (after winning
the Australian Cup, with Bst. 61b., in the fastest tune on
record) was weighted at 9st. Clb. Tins year he is gnen
the same impost. In the 1890 Cup aforesaid Maiv el was
indulged with Bst. 81bs. Had he nominated this year
lOst 31b. or lOst. 4lb. would have been about his portion.
Tirailleur, who has been going to win the last couple of
Cups, has’a stone less than in ’9O.
* o *
If the V.R C. hand!capper be correct in bis
estimate, the next Blue Riband is all over, for he asks
Autonomy to carry Sst.' in the Cup. Even Titan, the
sensational, was let off with 31hs. lighter, and 7st. till), was
the weight Strathmore failed with last year. Carbine
was not entered tor the Cup as a three-year-old, but on
his form would not have had more than the usual weight
for age. Good judges aver that Autonomy is the best we
have seen.
* # *
Interesting to note the different opinions of the
handicappers for Flemington and Caulfield. According
to Barnard, Zalinski is two pounds better than Malvolio;
Dakin thinks Strathmore and Malvolio each four pounds
better than Zalinski. In last Sydney Cup, Marvel was put
five pounds above Highborn, who had to give two to
Strathmore, and the latter two to Malvolio, while Zalinski
was placed four pounds lower down. Stromboh had ost.
when he won Sydney Cup. The once-wonderful Titan is
weighted in Melbourne Cup at 7st. 81b.—three pounds
less than he was asked to carry as a three-year old.
* * *
Leaving out the then three-year-olds, the best
of which is always a good place investment, the horses
having any pretensions to Melbourne Cup form are Mal-
volio, Strathmore, Dreadnought, Zalinski, Sir William,
Stromboli, St. Albans 11., Oxide, St. Blaize, and The
Admiral. Penance is kindly treated if he can be got back
to his two-vear-old form : Portsca, who has run very con-
sistently, appears to have quite enough. Among the
young stock those most likely to be dangerous are
Hue naif, Candour, A akecl, Attains, and the Captain. A
very probable candidate is Honour Bright, a raking four-
year-old by Grandmaster-Crystal. And, to pick three,
we would name him with Malvolio and St. Albans 11.

he would have to win with such a lead. But Young Aus-

round the turn at an angle of 45 deg., he fell off and rolled,
unhurt, inside the railings. Archer himself never did so

THE BEST
BEVERAGE
FOR
CHILDREN
Absolutely fure.
CADBURY’S COCOA is closely allied to
milk in the large proportion of flesh-forming and
strength-sustaining elements that it contains. It is pre-
pared on the principle of excluding the superabundance
of fatty indigestible matter with which Cocoa abounds
—supplying a refined thin infusion of absolutely pure
Cocoa, exhilarating and refreshing, for Breakfast, Lun-
cheon, Tea or Supper, giving staying power and im-
parting new life and vigour to growing children, and
those of delicate constitutions.
Tales of the Early Days.
No. X.—In the Granary.
[For The Bulletin.]
BY PRICE WARUNG.
There is no doubt that the place was
originally devoted to the purpose implied by its
name. But history everywhere is prolific of in-
stances in which an institution or thing has been
perverted from an originally admirable purpose to
a base use.
Captain Piper designed it—Captain Piper, the
genial officer of the New South Wales Corps who
was so beloved of John Maoarthur; afterwards
the Naval Officer whose accounts resolutely
refused to balance because he had been so obliging
as to allow duties payable by his friends to “ stand
over” indefinitely ; and, later still, the free-handed
squire of a Bathurst estate. He was Commandant
of Norfolk Island in the years immediately pre-
ceding the removal of the Island settlers to their
new and poorer homes in Van Demonia. It was
his invention.
Eight by six by ten in dimensions ; 480 cubic feet
in capacity. How many bushels of wheat and
maize would that contain ?
We do not know; all that we can assert is that
22 years after Captain Piper had departed from the
Island, this 8 x G x 10 excavated chamber, with the
stone floor, and stone walls, and stone ceiling—
this windowless room with but one solitary aper-
ture—and that in the roof—was occupied by—
what? Stores of maize ? Stores of wheat ? Bags
of ration-sugar?
No ; nothing so precious. By two convicts.
# # *
Piper had designed the chamber to store
surplus grain. Again and again had Government
barns and store-buildings been broken open by
prisoners who insnbordinately declined to starve
while the stores held stocks of food-stuff, and who
preferred a short shrift and a long rope to an
empty stomach. And, therefore, Captain Piper
resolved to defeat the mutinous and starving
rascals. Hehad this chamber dugout —built in with
stone—closed with an iron door in the roof, which
door turned upon a pivot and was fastened by
padlocked clamps. When he had filled the
granary with grain, he favoured it with additional
protection by sentries. And, upon the whole, the
Captain’s plan was successful. Not more than
one prisoner died from actual starvation during
the period the granary was full of a reserve stock
in case the store-ship with supplies from the Old
Town failed to make the island in due course.
And he, it is believed, died because he was for-
gotten. They locked him up in the old gaol cell
and quietly overlooked him for ten days. And
when they remembered him he had gone to report
himself to the authorities of a Higher System.
But that incident is by the way.
# * #
Wright was Commandant. And when be
took charge he found, in ttie course of an examina-
tion one day, an iron door level with the earth
and rusted in its socket of stone. He wondered
what it could be for just so long as it took to send
a soldier for the blacksmith, and for the time the
blacksmith was engaged in forcing the clamps.
When the iron-plate was made to revolve upon
its pin, Captain Wright—a Ghoorka, in after
years, let the life out of his body in a vain attempt
to find the ex-Cornmandant’s heart —looked down
into the cavity, smelt its exhumed mustiness, and,
gleefully, smote his thigh with his gloved hand.
“The very thing!” he exclaimed, “the very
thing !”
“ Sir ?” questioned Overseer Cook, who was in
respectful attendance.
“This will do for Freeman and Hansen, Cook.
No chance of their getting out of here !”
Not being an officer and gentleman, and not,
therefore, wholly intoxicated with the absolutism
of power, Overseer Cook shuddered. He was an
instance of the square peg in the round hole.
Transported for some aimless ranting iu a London
street over the Peterloo massacre, he was tried
under one of the Six Acts, and awarded, in recog-
nition of his patriotism, seven years’ residence
across the seas. On securing his certificate of
freedom, he became a clerk attached to Sydney
Police Office, and on the re-settlement of Norfolk
Island as a penal establishment, was appointed an
Overseer. He was at once an exception to one
rule and an illustration of another. An ex-convict
who became an overseer generally so acted that,
between himself and an average “officer and
gentleman” acting as commandant, there was
little to choose in respect of brutality. Cook was
an exception to this rule. But the rule that a
man transported for seditions utterances —for per-
mitting scorching words to pour forth from the
volcano of a heart which burnt with a fiery pity
for the poor, and a fiery contempt for the social
conditions which held the poor in bondage-
proved a genial taskmaster to prisoners when
clothed with authority, this he illustrated daily.
Cook, with every temptation to bo otherwise,
remained kind-hearted.
He shuddered, and ventured to hint a remon-
strance.
“You don’t mean, sir, do you, to put those
pris’ners here ?”
“ I do, Cook. What’s the use of gaoling them
or flogging ’em? No use at all! The scourgers
sooner take a flogging themselves than give ’em
the lash hearty, and till I build the new gaol, to
put ’em into gaol is only to contaminate every
man Jack there. I thought of marooning ’em,
but I didn’t want to lose six or eight lives in
getting ’em to the Phillip or Nepean. If any lives
were lost in the surf, ’twouldn’t be Freeman’s or
Hansen’s. They’re both bound to be scragged !”
“But, sir, this vault was never intended for a
gaol. According to the talk of the old hands, it
must have been a grain-store.”
“ Grain store or not, I’ll use it for those ruffians.
A brace of staples apiece driven in, and twenty-
pound trumpeters* will hold ’em in, or else my
name isn't Wright.”
“But, sir .” Cook, maudlinly inclined to
take a humane view of things, stumbled in his
speech.
“Well, sir?” demanded the Commandant,
sharply. “ What objection have you to the
course I suggest ? We don't want the place for
maize, for we have none, and wo do want another
punishment chamber,” ,
“ Well, Commandant, I was only thinking—.”
“Go on, damn it, go on ! Don’t be all day
blurting out your old womanish ideas—l know ’tis
something of that sort you have to say. I’ve
heard of you, Cook, before ! What the devil
Gov’ment meant by sending me bread-and-butter
misses who turn sick at a flogging and faint at
the use of the tube-gag on the biggest scoundrels
unhung, I don't know.”
“ Well, sir !” responded Cook with anew firm-
ness in his voice that told how he resented the
insult. “ I was thinking that since that new
paper had been started in Sydney ’tis scarcely safe
—-I say it with all respect—to venture upon
unusual punishments.”
Wright’s language here became unreportably
florid. Who on the island dared to let the Grub-
street hacks know of any of his doings, would do
so at his peril! And within the limits of his letter
of appointment he could punish how and in what
way he chose short of mutilation of limb or
deprivation of life ! And if lie had only the press
writers there he’d teach ’em to set just authority
at defiance and to slander honourable officers—
yes, he’d teach ’em, the scurrilous crew of penni-
less scribblers, who only existed because Gov’ment
would not deign to notice their existence !
So, with much garnish of adjectives, spoke the
Commandant. And he ended by daring Overseer
Cook to communicate a single word of island
intelligence to the journals of the Old Town, and
by ordering him to instantly prepare the granary
for the reception of those mutinous and con-
scienceless rascals, Freeman and Hansen.
» # «
The Overseer, having no choice, obeyed.
When the door or valve of the chamber had been
opened some hours, he lowered into it a lighted
candle. The flame flickered feebly as the candle
touched the floor, but did not go out. The fact
eased Cook’s conscience somewhat. After all,
men could not be suffocated there.
Then carefully,rope-held, he dropped through
the aperture and examined the vault. Obviously,
it had been used as a grain-store. The floor
was strewn with maize and wheat-grains. And
with equal certainty it had never been appro-
priated to the purposes of a prison. Cook, as he
gasped painfully in the heavy humidity of the
atmosphere, reflected that the fact was surprising,
for he thought the System was ingeniously eager
to introduce into Norfolk Island the most approved
methods of the Bastille. And here surely was a
chamber that would not have been unfit lodging
for the most dangerous State criminal ever
honoured by a lettre de each el ? The wonder was
not that it was now to be used for a prison,
but that it had not been so appropriated before.
Eight feet long, six in width, ten feet from
the middle of the floor to the edges of the opening
in the roof, the nine feet high walls curving
slightly to their centre. And when the valve was
closed, though outside the magnificent sun shone
from the dome of a cloudless sky, darkness
palpable and terrifying. Cook cried out to the
men above to open the valve ; it was but a second
before the plate revolved on the pivot; but in that
instant the Overseer felt himself blanching. It
was a tomb.
He could not hold in his emotion. Withdrawn
by the rope, he threw himself upon the ground in
an attitude of prayer. “ Christ!” he prayed.
“Christ! let no men be imprisoned there !”
And he sent the smith, who had come up with
ring-bolts and chisels, back to his forge. “ Not
to-day, George—not, at least, till I have seen the
Commandant again.”
# # *
The smith returned to his work-shop to
relate “Cook’s prayer” as a good joke, and the
two prisoner-police, who formed the Overseer’s
personal staff, told of the matter in their en-
lightened circle, and at dinner at Government
House, Captain Wright delighted the. surgeon,
and the subaltern, and the commissary with his
version of the incident.
“And what have you done with the canting
cove, Captain?” questioned the Deputy-Assistant-
Commissary-General.
“Done! Well, he’s packing up by this time,
I don’t doubt. He's resigned, and returns to the
city by the brig next week.”
“Phew!’ exclaimed the D.A.C.G. “That’s
hot, Wright! Is he going to make a fuss about
it?”
“Gad ! I don’t know nor care. Why should I
care what a psalm-singing lag of a constable should
say about me? My word will be taken by the
authorities, I should hope, before his!” His
Honor the Commandant displayed a dignified
aspect, and spoke in a confident tone, as though
he could safely anticipate in advance an honour-
able acquittal from any charge that might be
preferred against hid.
“Yes, but,” delicately hinted the D.A.0.G.,
“ ’tis not the Chiefs. ’Tis that wretched Austra-
lian and Monitor. There woidd be the rub if the
fellow took particulars to them.”
“ Sir,” replied the Commandant superbly con-
scious of his power, “if Warded or Hayes or Hall
dare impugn my conduct, I’ll challenge the first
and indict the others for criminal libel.”t
“But,” persisted the Commissariat, who was,
for sundry reasons connected with contracts, not
at all desirous that the light of publicity should
beat upon the Gehenna of the waters, “suppose —
er—what —er —they say is true ! ”
“True, sir!” The Captain was nearly forget-
ting his courtesy as a host, so heated did he
become. “ I’d have you know that every action
of mine I’m prepared to justify in any court of the
Empire. But, pass the wine—we’ve had more
than enough talk about two common pris’ners !
Let’s forget .’em ! ”
* # *
lb would have been well for those infamous
prisoners, Freeman and Hansen, if they had
passed utterly from the great man’s mind. Un-
fortunately for them, however, the statement
Captain Wright made in evidence before the
Supreme Court at a later day, “ that he could not
charge his conscience with having overlooked any
man on the Island,” was quite true —a thing not
to be said of other portions of his testimony. He
perfectly remembered them the next morning.
“Reports, sir !” deferentially remarked (with a
salute) the Gaoler.
“ Yes, Thorpe. I’m ready to take them.”
Mr. Thorpe opened his report-book.
“Freeman, sir—foul language and threatening
to assault constable who took him his food.”
“ Pass Freeman for the present. I propose to
deal with him in anew way !”
“Yes, sir. Greene, sir. Found in possession
of improper article, sir. Tobacco !”
“ I thought he was celled ?”
“So he is, sir. No. 5!”
“And ironed ?”
“ Trumpeters—fifteen’s—and wall-cuffs !”£
“Then how the devil ” —the insulted feelings of
the offended System breathed in the Comman-
dant’s tones —“did Greene get the tobacco? Some
of your men to blame there, Thorpe !”
“No, sir, ’m quite sure o’ that. The sentries
passed it ” Thorpe paused. He had for-
gotten that here with, the Civil and Military
Command vested in the one person, it was scarcely
a wise thing to play the game so familiar to other
settlements, of blaming the military for the laches
of the “establishment.” - '
*“ Trumpeters ” —lrons which connected the ordinary
leg-chains with a bazil riveted around each leg im-
mediately below the knees.
t He did the last.
+ “ Wall-cuffs.”—Manacles fastening a prisoner’s wrist
to a wall-staple.

“Now, Thorpe, be careful. I’ll have none of
this accusation of the garrison to excuse neglect
on your own part or corruption on your men’s,
Where’s the tobacco ? Is it produced ? ’
“No, sir. Tlfi pris’ner swallowed it, sir! I
was goiifi rounds after breakfast, and No. 5 stands
up and gulps something down, and I knew ’twas
tobacco by the smell of bis breath.”
“ Did you charge him ?”
“Of course, sir, but, of course, he denies. He
said it was a bit of crust left from breakfast that
he was chewing.” _
“Oh, a likely story that ! You’re sure of the
smell ?”
“Quite, your Honor !” affirmed Thorpe, a tall,
fresh-faced ex-soldier, who was not half-a-bad
fellow under Major Anderson, but under Wright
was a miniature of that tyrant—he took his cue
always from his superiors. _ (
“He is handcuffed to the wall, is he?”
“Yes, sir!” ’
“ One hand only? ’
“Yes, sir!”
“ Then double my gentleman’s irons, and darby
the other hand. Next!”
“But, beg parding, sir—what about the bad
languidge, sir?”
“Yes, I was forgetting that. Was it very
bad?” .
“Awful, sir! Made my blood run cold ! ’
“ Four hours’ tube-gag ! Next! ”
* * *
The next was a mere non-entity—a “re-
fusing-to-work ” man—the most fervent believer
in the Carlylean doctrine of the soul saving
qualities of work would have doubted his creed
had he been compelled to work in 15-pound
trumpeters. He was ordered 30 lashes— not on
the back. Wright believed punishment on the
back was a concession to a morbidity of sentiment,
And the next accused was a nobody, too. Said
he was ill. Gaoler affirmed he wasn’t. Prisoner
asked to see doctor. Gaoler said he shouldn’t.
Prisoner took the Bible which was the principal—
almost the only—furniture of a gaol cell and
kissed it, swearing he was ill. Gaoler, shocked at
the blasphemy, formally charged the man with
prevaricating to evade work—threatened to report
him—now did so—received Commandant’s in-
structions to reduce the ration of 12-ounces
bread and one half-pint of water made by the
generous system even to the turbulent
spirits in gaol. Gaoler, touching bis fore-
head, pencilled with stubby finger, a cabalistic
mark against the Nobody’s name, and. passed to
the next offender. Three days hence, lie will put
the pencil through the name. The Nobody has,
by that time, done the very best thing he ever did
for himself—has taken up permanent quarters in
the little cemetery by the sea. The manchineel
drops its tears on the nameless mounds of a hundred
of such nobodies.
The next accused was Hansen.
“Insubordinate conduct, sir—very insubor-
dinate, sir, I may say.”
“What did he say ?” _
“ Nothing ; ’twas not what he said : ’twas what
he did !”
“ Well, what did he do?”
“Nothing, sir—simply refused to speak!”
“ That is his offence ?”
“Yes, sir!”
“Pass him for the present. Next!”
But with the next and his successors at that
day’s court we have nothing here to do. ihey
are to us, as their names appear on the partly-
inked, partly-pencilled record before us, mere
shadows. “Dismissed” to one; “twenty-five”
to three; “one hundred” to a fifth; and a
“spread-eagle” to a sixth : these are the entries
against the names of these phantasms. They are
only phantasms—let us thank Heaven for that !
For surely could we realise, even at this distance
of time, that these names were those of men
sharers with ourselves in the glorious possession
of life—our hearts would throb and our eyes fill
with sympathetic tears at the thought that all of
them, save one, passed unheard and untried to
punishment.
1 * # »
And Freeman and Hansen—what of them %
Up to this date only the prisoners in the gaol
had been supplied with “magpie”—yellow (or
brown) and black —clothing, the stock of that
parti-coloured finery being too low to admit of its
being issued to other than the aristocrats of crime.
And therefore when Freeman and Hansen were
ordered by the Commandant to be transferred to
the granary, they were, as a preliminary to re-
moval, stripped. In lieu of their comparatively
warm costume—some idiot of a manufacturer had
actually dared to make a batch of magpie stuff of
strong half-woollen material instead of cottony
shoddy—they were re dressed, Freeman in the
dyed rags§ of some ex-Hessian soldier, Hansen in
Parramatta dungaree. The foi’mer’s case was not
so bad, but the previous tenant of Hansen's suit
had been a worker in the wet quarry, whence were
obtained the drip-stones so much in demand in
Sydney households, and the garments were still
soaking when Hansen was compelled to don them.
The result was that before they had been 24 hours
in the granary, Hansen was coughing violently.
Disciplinarians like Wright could take little
account of consumptive tendencies, and it was
reserved for a latter-day Commandant to invent
wet-quarry clothing out of condemned blankets,
and thus give the quarrymen a working change.
* # *
The gaol-allowance of food was bread equal
to 12 ounces flour, and a half-pint of water daily.
The same ration was issued to the tenants of the
granary—lucky dogs that they were ! The same
unstinted allowances and double the space of floor
and breathing room as they enjoyed in the gaol!
Yet—they refused to be happy. That is to say,
Freeman. As for Hansen, he did not care after
the second day. He was really getting beyond
caring for anything.
“ Harry,” said Freeman—it was the third night
—“ I can’t stand this ! ” Hansen was racked with
his cough. His solitary thin blanket was no
protection against the cold.
“ I’m sorry, Bob—but 1 can’t help it, pal. I
Tidn’t make such a row if t’other hand was free,
I’d ’old it in !” He had but one hand frre ; the
other was linked, with a steel clasp, to the wall.
The granary was, one should have thought, safe
enough for even Freeman and Hansen, without
the ingenious accessory of wall-cuffs. But Captain
Wright thought otherwise. And to 15-pound
irons on the men he had added the single-handed
steel attachment.
“ Stow that stuff, Harry ! Cough, if you want
to. What I meant was that I can’t stand this
place for you. Horspital’s th’ place for you, old
chap - an’ that Com’dant ’ll ha’ to put you there
or there’ll be trouble.”
“ Lor, Bob, don’t yer take on now, an’ get
——The cough interrupted the remonstrance.
“ And get what?”
“Into your tantrums on my ’count.”
“Not a bit of it, old chap. Tain’t on your
account at all —leastwise, not altogether. I’m
going to break this tomb business, once and
for all! / don’t mind, Harry—l’m as cosy here as
in a cell, or spread-eagled round a lamp-post on a
cold night! But it’s such chaps as you, old ood-
g.er—with any amount o’ heart, but not a stivers’
worth of bodily strength to feed lh’blood with.
It’s for you, and such as you, I’m going to break
up this —— granary punishment! ”
The fellow flung out his words in ascending
tones that unmistakably expressed the tense fierce-
ness of passion which was gnawing him. He was
liable to be swayed by great gusts of passion,
though for weeks together he would be as quiescent
as the grave. But the account-keeping gave him
no credit for his placid intervals, measuring his
nature by its cyclonic periods. And one of those
was now upon him epileptic almost in its
violence.
Hansen, who knew his co-prisoner well—they
had bolted together, been wound up together
on the Wellington when on the voyage from
Sydney, been flogged, ’cuffed, “ spread-eagled, ’
celled together—cowered in his own corner, and
with his one hand, sought to check his coughing,
so as not to agitate Freeman the more.
The twilight outside was fading into darkness
in the interior, but the sick prisoner saw every
movement, every feature of his comrade. Free-
man—who was short and sturdy of figure, and
who had grievously offended the System time after
time, because, in spite of continued short com-
mons, he would preserve strength, as though his
will replenished his sap—knelt down. He knelt
sideways to the wall, as the short ’cuff-chain would
not permit of his facing it, A suspicious System
foresaw that a ’cuffed prisoner might, by thrusting
his feet against the wall, secure leverage for the
withdrawal of the staple.
Not in prayer did Freeman kneel, but to gain
the greater purchase on the steel-links which held
his right wrist firmly to the wall. And thus
kneeling, his broad flanks were drawn in—his
upper teeth scored his lower lip to their full depth
his left hand was thrust forward and grasped
the ’cuff-chain—the blood shot into his eyes, and
left his cheeks so livid that their ghastliness
shimmered in the gathering gloom. He hauled
once, twice —and then, with a deep groan, an in-
voluntary tribute to overstressed nature, lie fell
back, his head striking dully the stone floor. For
some minutes he lay in the happy enfranchise-
ment of a swoon.
When he recovered, he was comparatively free.
;F ree __that is, to the extent of his ’cuff-shackle.
He had pulled out the wall-staple, and the manacle
dangled from his wrist.
The effort had been terrible : that last moment
of strain before the stone had yielded up the staple
had clutched his wrist in a constriction as suffo-
cating as the experience of the Laocoon in the
coils of the serpent. He could not believe, at first,
that it was the staple which had given way : he
thought the ring which had grasped his flesh had
cut his hand from the arm.
But when he saw what he had achieved, when
for the first time for months he realised that he
could walk the length of his cell—he had been
wall-’cuffed, remember, in gaol also —he sank
nervelessly into the corner next Hansen, anti,
dropping his head on his knees, gasped his relief
in tearless sobs. And, so squatting, he passed into
slumber. Hansen need not have striven so
strenuously' to repress his coughing. Freeman’s
exhaustion conferred upon him the rare boon of a
dreamless sleep.
Once only during the night did he seem on the
verge of waking. That was when Hansen, who
had stinted himself to half his ration of water
during the day in order that.he might retain some
for the thirst of the parching night-hours, dipped
into his pannikin the rag which served him as a
handkerchief; and then, stretching himself noise-
lessly towards his sleeping comrade, placed the
moistened bit of cotton upon the fevered forehead.
Freeman stirred, but did not wake. And, per-
haps, he slept the sounder for the other convict’s
poor, priceless sacrifice.
* * *
The dawn-light stole into the vault through
the aperture in the roof. With a fine generosity
Wright had consented to the iron door remaining
unclosed, as, ho concluded, the wall-’cufTs held
these two dreadful ruffians firmly ; so, before
Freeman awoke, the sweet, glorious day had sent
a shaft of radiance into the darkness. It fell upon
Hansen’s face and roused him, and he, in turn,
gently shook the slumberer.
“Bob ! ”he said, “ rashins T 1 be ’-ere presently.
There’s the yard-bell, now ! ”
Freeman turned, and sat up, and recollection
coming back as drowsiness vanished, replied,
“ Right, Harry, old chap. How’s the cough ? ”
“ Not a bit easier, Bob—but hadn’t yer better
get back to your corner ? Rashins T 1 be ’ere in a
jiffy ! ”
Freeman rose and walked across, and laughed
as he crossed the bar of light and held up the
dangling steel-clips to glisten in the beam.
“Wouldn’t it spoil the Com’dant’s breakfast,
Harry, to know as I stand here ? ”
“ Is your wrist sore, Bob ?”
“ Sore ain’t a name for it, Harry, but the sea-
air’ll cure it! ’’
Hansen started in his corner. “What d’ye
mean, Bob. Yer ain’t a-thinkm’ o’ boltin’, are
yer ? ”
Freeman laughed. “No—no such luck. But
I am going for a sea-trip to the Old Town, an’
you’re going, too.”
“ What’s—what’s—the use —of jokin’, Harry?”
The question was punctuated with coughs, and
vibrated with a poignant despair.
Freeman turned and placed bis hand in
Hansen’s; “Don’t give up, Harry, pal! Don’t
funk on it! I’ve sworn to have yer out o’ this,
an’ I will!”
“ ’Ovv, Bob, ’ow ?”
“I wont tell you, Harry. Ye’ll have to trust
me. If you don’t know, they can’t bring you in
acoess’ry !”
And though Hansen tried, he obtained n~ more
satisfaction than that indefinite answer.
* # #
Their rations came. “ Catch !” said the
“outer ’’-billet prisoner who had been detailed by
the under-gaoler to deliver the food and drink so
magnanimously allowed them. And as he spoke,
he bent down and threw the hunks of bread into
the corners. And the water he lowered in a pot,
with a looped cord—a pint between them. Free-
man repeated his previous day’s performance and
dragged the can with his feet till he could reach
it with his left hand, and divide its contents
between the pannikins.
§“Dyed Rags.”—A considerable portion of convicts’
clothing for many years consisted of army contractors’
stock of uniforms made for George the Third’s
mercenaries.
II “Wound np together”—Fa route from Sydney or
V.D.L. to Norfolk Island, prisoners were generally hand-
cuffed to a cable, which passed through the hold and con-
nected with the windlass. On any signs of disturbance, a
turn or two of the windlass—and quiet was restored.

“All right?” questioned the messenger..
“ Com’dant ’opes as yer’ve ’ad a good night!”
he continued, with a genial satire in Ids laugh.
“ Hansen oughter see th’ croaker,” said
Freeman.
“Wot’s th’ use o’ that lay. Bob Freeman?
Yer know as Wright’s not a bird as’ll be caught
by that ere sort o’ chaff. ’Udn’t I look a fool now
ter report ’Arry ’Ansen sick, an’ then by-an’-bye,
tli’ doc. comes ’loner an’ ses he’s a-shammin’
Abram?” And, confident in his own wisdom and
the deceit of the two prisoners, he went his way.
“ In the last resort the System is often adminis-
tered by convict understrappers,” wrote Dr. War-
dell pseudonymously to his own paper, the Aus-
tralian. “The great men who rule frequently
work through illiterate brutes.”
# * »
Through the long day that terrible rascal,
Freeman sought to amuse his fellovv-confinee.
With jest and low chant —a loudly-sung song
might have procured the tribute of the tube-gag —
lie sought to help Hansen’s spirits to laughter-
point. And by one other thing also.
He “ blanketted ” his irons. He tore the shoddy
stuff into strips, to Hansen’s wonderment, and
wrapped the pieces round the “trumpeter” irons,
so they should not clank. Then —for Hansen’s
amusement, so he said-—he practised jumping up-
wards so as to touch the roof with his palms. Not
with his finger-tips merely, but with his palms.
Now, his irons were fifteen-pounders. They
were light for “trumpeters.” still they waxed
weightier and weightier as he persisted in his
exercise. And if you wish to know the true
character of the task which he set himself, try the
experiment of jumping with seven-pound dumb-
bells fastened to your feet.
Three or four times in quick succession would
he leap upwards. Then he would rest and regain
breath. And then he would spring up again,
until at last he had achieved his end. Thrice
running he had touched with both palms open at
once the roof within a few inches of the margin of
the door-opening. And Hansen, interested, forgot
to cough. Like manna to starving people,
desert-lost, was his comrade’s athletic endeavours
to the monotony-damned invalid.
“The night’s come soon, Bob,” he said, as the
early darkness fell. “ That’s ’cos we’ve had some-
think to think about.”
“Tis just that, Harry, pal. An’ ye’ll see to-
morrer ’ll pass quicker,” Freeman gasped, for he
was quite exhausted.
“Wot, agoin’ to try it to-morrer again?”
“Rather!” replied Freeman, with a chuckle.
And the prospect of further pleasure on the
morrow kept him warm in lieu of his blanket.
* * »
The yard-bell had swung its ding-dong at
the breakfast-hour, and the sound stole over the
quarter-mile of vacant ground to the granary.
And Hansen urged Freeman, who had been walk-
ing up and down the cell, to regain his corner.
“ Dick’ll be here soon,” he said. To his surprise
and alarm, however, Freeman simply smiled, and
continued his walk to and fro.
“Bob, are yer crazy? Rashin’s ’ll be ’ere, I
say.”
“ I ain’t crazy, Harry, an’ I know they’ll be
here.”
“ But he’ll coteh yer, Bob !”
“ I think the boot ’ll be on t’other leg, Harry !”
answered Freeman.
And it was.
As the steps of the messenger, Dick, were
heard approaching, Freeman halted just without
the disc of light cast by the. aperture upon the
stone floor, and so that the bearer of the rations
could not see him without peering down.
“Below there, boys!” called Dick. And he
repeated the words growlingly as they met with no
response.
Then Dick stooped down to peer into the
corners.
“ Yer lazy wretches ”
He fdid not live to complete the sentence, of
reproach. He had spoken thus far when Free-
man, under the impulse of the ferocious passion
which he had been nursing since the break of the
day, sprang mightily upwards. His hands met on
the doomed felon’s throat, and though Dick was
not so maddened by his death agony that he did
not strive to force himself backwards, Freeman’s
grasp did not relax. As the latter was drawn
down by his irons, he pulled the semi-conscious
Dick after him. A minute later all was over for
Messenger Dick.
The felicity of the System was that at every
nook and corner of the Regulations and every
stage of routine, it provided an opportunity for
someone to get hanged. Even the life-saving
institution of the granary, you see, had proved the
ante-chamber to the gallows.
* * *
For, of course, the System meritoriously
hanged Convict Freeman after trial in Sydney,
but do what Convict Hansen could by way of
impressive appeal to C.J. Sir Francis Forbes, to
treat him, Hansen, not as a witness but as an
accessory before the fact, it declined to hang him.
“ Harry Hansen’s a-committin’ perjury, y’
Honor,” said the accused, “when he says as he
suggested the doin’ o’ Dick. |He speaks truth,
though, when he says as he was witness. I wanted
him to be witness.”
“ Why ? ” shuddered the C.J.
“Because, y’r Honor, I wanted people in the
Old Town here to know as a sick lag like Harry
there can’t get the Croaker’s ’tendance at Norfolk.
1 put it to y’r Honor, ain’t he sick, an’ the Com’-
dant says he was shammin’ Abra’m.”
And the Court looked at the consumptive ruffian,
and in its judicial mind gave him a week longer to
live than Freeman. And Freeman would “suffer ”
on Monday week, and this was Wednesday.
But the Court was wrong.
On the Friday before his Monday, Freeman,
staring out of one of the dozen fully occupied con-
demned cells, saw two of the prisoner-wardsmeu
attached to the gaol-hospital bearing a grey-
sheeted form into the corridor. They stopped
before his cell. “Are yer Norfo’k Freeman?”
questioned the front bearer.
“Yes! That Harry?”
“This is Hansen. Guv’nor ses as ’ow ’e thort
yer’d like ter see th’ larst of ’im.” And he turned
down the sheet, so that the pinched, peaked
features were visible.
“So, Harry,” said the Condemned, “you’ve got
home first, have you? Well, ’tis kind of the
’thorities to let me see you. The fun of it is,
though, that they’re always so dev’lish kind when
’tis too late.”
As we have no fancy for attempting the impos-
sible, we shall not try and demonstrate that
Condemned Convict Freeman was in error in that
last remark.
Meat export has just added a new word to
the vocabulary of the sheep trade. “ Prime
freezers ” appear in the market reports.
The Maoriland Government having refused
to pay the medical fees and burial expenses of a
constable who died from injuries received on duty,
a general police subscription lias been raised to
do it.
The Kroline and Seseman chloroform-
inhaler has been invented to fit the Hyderabad
chloroform commission’s dictum that the touch-
stone to the safe administration of the anaesthetic
is proper attention to breathing. Under the K.
and S. system the chloroform reaches the lungs as
a dry vapour, and the patient’s expirations are
marked by the agitation of an almost weightless
feather delicately balanced over the mouth.
The queerest keep-my-name-out-of-the
paper case ever we heard was in Geelong. A
gentleman of evidently respectable exterior, named
Robert Stewart, was fined at the police-court for
being drunk, and went round to the editor with
the offer of a liberal honorarium (as we heard a
Melbourne attorney put it to a reporter, to keep
out an hotel case) to have his name withheld.
Says the indignant editor : “ We were not going
to put it in, but now we will.” Nevertheless it
appeared as Ranald Steinwarth—half Scotch, half
Schlaohdalager. After that, the chair gave the
“ chapel ” best.
This story is told of the late J. A.
Cunneen, M.L.A., and a present member of the
N.S.W. Upper ’Ouse, who, after repented defeats
in his old constituency was kindly provided with
a comfortable snoozing-place there for life a few
years ago. A close division was expected and the
present life legislator was told off to prevent
Cunneen—who wasn’t a teetotaller—from voting on
the opposite side. But in this case the Irishman
over-reached the canny Scot; the wrong man went
under the table and James Augustine bad the
satisfaction of piloting his boon companion into
the very lobby from which it had been intended
to exclude himself, to the great disgust, it need
hardly be said, of the latter’s party.
Johnny Martin, M.L.C., Wellington,
capitalist, just dead, who began as a carter, once
contested a seat in the Maoriland Parliament.
Johnny couldn’t make a speech, and what’s more
knew it, so he arranged with a confederate to
break up his meeting. He had just got past
“ladies and gentlemen” when an unbearable
odour arose. Johnny stopped in well-feigned
astonishment, denounced “ this dastardly outrage
of the other side,” and with his handkerchief to
his nose said that as they couldn’t go on with the
meeting they had best all come and have a drink.
The motion was carried unanimously, and at the
nearest pub., after Johnny bad been deeply
sympathised with, he whispered to the perpetrator
of “the dastardly outrage” that if it had been
delayed another minute he must have broken
down.
Lloyds’ Weekly :— /
Mr. George Spencer Briggs, the conclusion of whose
story “The Blacksmith’s Daughter” appears in our sixth
page, is a young Australian author who came into note
during last year. When the Sydney Government offered
a prize for the best poem written by a native of New
South Wales Mr. Briggs carried it off triumphantly over
400 competitors. “ The Blacksmith’s Daughter ” is inter-

A Split and a Junction.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Where does this river lead to ?”
“Goodness knows ! Somewhere on the coast.’
“Of course it does. But what part ?”
How should I know ? What I should like to
know is ; how are we going to get down that gorge
on footsore horses ?”
“ Best way we can.”
The questions and answers were rough enough ;
but when men have been starving for a few days
civility is not one of the cardinal virtues with
them.
On the brow of a range which, strange to say,
has not yet found a name on any Australian map,
two men were standing regarding the prospect
before them. The range was in the Northern
Territory of South Australia, and faced the
long, southern shore of the Gulf of Carpen-
taria. Somewhat beneath them lay stretched a
maze of rough hills, with a watercourse, easily
distinguished by the green of the tree-tops, wind-
ing its uncertain way. But what a lonely scene !
In all the wide expanse there was nothing to
suggest the presence of life, not even the smoke
of a distant native camp. The men were abso-
lutely alone, separated by hundreds of miles from
their fellows, and all they could do under the
circumstances was to quarrel. So they did it.
“I told you we should have gone down that
spur we passed yesterday afternoon,” growled
one. “Now” —and he indicated what lay before
them with a wave of the hand.
“Well. Go back and tackle it yourself, I’m
sick of this constant nagging. We’ll divide
what few rations are left and each man take his
own horses.”
A few more sharp words spoken in the solitude,
and then the two proceeded to divide the small
portion that stood between them and death.
“ Good bye,” grunted one.
“ 0 ! go to !” said the other.
And that was all that passed between two men
who had been fast friends and close companions
for many months, and who now fell out on the
question of which was the best way down a range,
simply because they were hungry and had been
forced to have none other but their own society
for a considerable time.
Awfully like married life !
The case was peculiar - . About 12 months pre-
viously the two men had invested in a small lot
of fat cattle and taken them from the North of
Queensland round by the, then uninhabited,
almost unknown coast-track to Port Darwin.
Having got rid of their stocii to advantage (for in
those days there were few cattle of any sort in the
Territory) they decided on returning by a different
route more to the South to see if they could find
any country worth stocking. They were successful
enough in this quest, but seeking to make their
way Morth, to regain the route by which they
travelled the cattle, they found themselves, with
footsore horses and scanty rations, amongst ranges
which rendered their way difficult.
So they parted, as just related, each man taking
his own two horses w.tli him ; one ridden and one
packed. It may be mentioned that this was the
first quarrel the men had had throughout their
trip.
Jack Evans, the man who selected to go back to
the spur, had got about 10 or 15 miles on the
back track by dusk. He turned out his tired
horses and lay down for a cheerless, hungry camp.
Barton, who preferred going on, made an attempt
to follow the river, the extreme head of which
they had been on when the disagreement took
place.
He did not get far. The gorge was very rough
and impracticable, his horses were footsore,,and at
sundown he found himself between high, stony
hills which forced him to pick a painful way along
the bed of the river, now much increased in size.
Selecting as good a camp as possible under the
circumstances, he, like his late mate, laid himself
down supperless in no very pleasant frame of mind.
What few rations they had both men felt it
necessary to husband carefully, as the region they
were in contained little game, and that, as it
always is in unsettled country, .was as wild as it
could be. ~ , ,
Needless to say, both were pretty wakeful and
had time to reflect on their hasty words; but each
arose in the morning with a determination that he
was right, and would not give in, in case they
should ever meet again—a doubtful possibility.
Evans reached the spur he was making for early
in the morning, and commenced to descend. It
led him round to the east, the direction in which
he had left Barton, and finally, of course, ran out
at the junction of two creeks. As the hills on each
side looked most unpromising he kept to the
creek, but did not make much progress during
the day. That night his rations were done; still,
he was going in the right direction.
The corresponding day Barton was equally un-
lucky. He made but slow progress down the
river he had elected to follow, and was so hungry
that, like Evans, he devoured the whole of his
scanty store when he camped ; still, he was making
North, if but slowly.
The next day, about noon, he saw, to his great,
joy, that he was getting into better country. Pre-
sently the ranges fell back on either side and he
found himself on comparatively level land. The
flat was sandy, and he was able to make good pro-
gress ; so, tightening his belt, he rode on.
About five o’clock he noticed a large creek
coming in on the other side of the river, and
almost at the same moment heard a sound like the
bellow of a cow or bullock. That was impossible,
surely. He looked around, not a track was visible.
Suddenly it arose again, quite distinctly, there was
no doubt; there was a beast in the bed of the
river. Visions of frizzling steak and hot joints
arose at once before him. They must be cattle
lost from an overlanding mob, making up the
river. By sneaking up to the bank on foot he
could surely pot one with his rifle. His horses
were too tii’ed to move far, he had only to un-
buckle the strap of his rifle and commence his
stalk. He had noted the position of the sound,
and when he peered cautiously over the edge of
the bank he had the glorious satisfaction of see-
ing a solitary white cow feeding along a bank or
small island in the bed. The river hero was clear
and this was the only obstruction in it.
No thought of cattle-stealing entered Barton’s
mind ; beef was the only consideration. “Behind
the shoulder,” he thought to himself, took careful
aim, and fired.
The cow jumped forward, and stood for a
megnent. “Missed, by thunder!” ho cried,
when there came another report from the opposite
bank and she staggered and fell over.
Barton rushed down the bank and made for the
island, and as he did so another man followed his
example from the opposite side. Tin > met at
tlie dead beast.
“That’s my beast !” said Barton.
“She’s mine !” said Evans.
They looked at each other fiercely, then burst out
laughing. “Don’t you think there’s enough for
both?” said one. and across the carcase they shook
hands.
“ Let's have a look whose she is,” said Barton,
as he looked at the ear-mark. “Why, hang it
all, she’s our own ! It’s that white cow we lost on
the Robinson, and she’s been wandering about
here ever since. We can’t be so far from where
we crossed.” Nor were they.
Needless to say the creek that Evans got on to
was a tributary of the river Barton was following
and junctioned close to where they found the
cow.
N. T.
A West Australian correspondent tells us
that had Miss Rounsevell been permitted to reach
the place at which she had intended to meet her
Deeming—viz., Yilgarn, W. A.—she would have
suffered a far greater ordeal than that of being
cemented underground. The Yilgarn region is a
vast wilderness and sand-plain, and the house
which Deeming had intended for her was, though
about the best there, only wattle-and-daub. In-
deed, had he intended to “ plant” her, it would not
have been by the use of cement; for he need only
have carried her a few yards away, scratched a
hole in the sand, and, after a sand-storm had
passed over the spot—which, by the way, occurs
almost every hour of the day—all trace wotild have
vanished.
A Melbourne hotelkeeper was lately
“taken down” for .£lOO by two well-dressed
“ spielers.” He was anxious to sell his house, but
not fancying paying a broker’s commission, adver-
tised “principals only.” A day or two after, a
well-dressed man came to his house, and intro-
duced himself as a prospective buyer. He pro-
fessed himself well satisfied with the trade, &c.,
and finally an agreement was drawn up, and a
deposit of <£loo made, to be forfeited if either
party wished to withdraw. Soon after, another
man came in, and on hearing that a bargain bad
been made, professed himself terribly cut up, and
declared his willingness to give the publican <£2so
more than the other man had offered. The man
of pewter, scenting a good thing, agreed to with-
draw from his previous agreement, provided that
the second buyer would make his deposit at once.
The latter at once drew out his cheque-book, and
wrote a cheque for <£loo. Next day the first
purchaser walked in, and when he learned that
Beerpull wished to withdraw from his bargain, be
grew very indignant, threatened legal proceed-
ings, and could with difficulty be persuaded to
accept the publican’s <£loo forfeit. As the second
man didn’t turn up in a few days, Beerpull
became anxious, and decided to present his
cheque. To his horror, it was returned “no
account.” Of course, he never caught them, and
he has decided to employ a broker in future.
The Victorian aborigines, black-and-tan
as well, only number a fifth of the N.S. Welsh.
A returns hies towards the earth at 55 miles

The French police have captured one
“Anarchist,” anyhow. There was a premature
explosion at Tours, and the' dynamiter blew his
hand off in the confusion, and was found insensible
among the ruins. He proved to be a tea-merchant
in a good way of business, a solid Catholic, and a
.Royalist, and he had gone into the bomb busines-
in the hope of overturning the republic, and brings
ing back the Bourbons.
