The Red Page
William Shakspeare de Vere
The greatest poet who has written in the
English language is Edward de Vere, Earl
of Oxford. I write this sentence in the full
knowledge that it will provoke an indulgent
snort from three-fourths of those who read
it and an indignant smile from most of the
rest; yet with the absolute conviction of one
who has gone through the whole mass of
evidence collected by J. Thomas Looney in
“Shakespeare ” Identified (Cecil Palmer,
London), I assert that he has made his case
good and that the works known as Shales-,
peare’s were written by de Vere. Much of
the evidence I reject as trivial, some as
foolish; but the stronger points stand. I
came to the hook full of prejudice and with
a distinct bias against anyone who would
attempt to rob the great dramatist of his
laurels. That feeling was increased by the
author’s manner and his confession of igno-
rance of so much that is common knowledge;
yet by the sheer, hard logic of facts advanced
he proved his case to me, a reader most un-
willing to be convinced.
An adequate account of the long argument
with the hundreds of points raised and the
inferences from facts established would
occupy a space equal to one-third of the big
volume itself; for the pages are packed with
matter and no time is wasted in ornament.
Roughly stated, the method of this investi-
gator is, first of all, to prove that William
Shakspeare, of Stratford, could not- have
written the plays except by a miracle, that
every record of his life makes him appear a
most unlikely person to have written them,
and that even if he had something to do with
them he had no interest in their publication
and no ownership in them. Next he looks
round for one who could have written them,
and discovers that de Vere published verses
over his own name that are more in the
manner of those attributed to Shakspeare
than the work of any other Elizabethan
writer. Next, he finds that this de Vere is
the first user of the Shakspearean form
of sonnet; that the Southampton to whom
“Venus” and “Lucrece” were dedicated was
de Vere’s friend and son-in-law; that de
Vere is intei’ested from an early age in
the drama and recognised as a great play-
wright by contemporaries, although none of
his plays are known. Clearly, with such a
start, de Vere is a possible author of the
Shakspeare plays if the dates and facts of
his life will fit in with the theory. The
dates and facts of his life do fit in in a
most extraordinary fashion. While the
great plays "-were being published William
Shakspeare was in Stratford, buying land,
lending money, pressing for debts, planting
orchards, supplying malt; but Edward de
Vere was in Lond’on in complete retirement
engaged in some close occupation which his
correspondents apologised for breaking in
upon even by sending him a letter. From
this Looney goes on to a close examination
of contemporary references, to trace the per-
sonal history of de Vere in many of the
plays, to unearth stories of him which are
illustrated by things attributed to Shaks-
peare, and to turn the careful studies of
modern authorities into the main stream of
his long argument. To follow all this here
would be impossible. Let us take one im-
portant point by way of example. The
stanzas in Edmund Spenser’s “Tears of the
Muses,” which were so long considered to
be a reference to Shakspeare, have of late
puzzled commentators. The “Willie” referred
to seemed to be either Shakspeare or no-
body ; but the verses were published in
1590, a date at which William Shakspeare
at the age of 26 could only have been mak-
ing a beginning as a dramatist. Here are
the lines: —
And he the man whom Nature’s self had made
To mock herself and truth to imitate,
With kindly counter under mimic shade,
Our pleasant Willie, ah! is dead of late.
With whom all joy and jolly merriment
Is also deaded and in doleur drent.
But that same gentle spirit from whose pen "
Large streams of honey and sweet nectar flow,
Scorning the boldness of such base-born men,
Which dare their follies forth so rashly throw,
Doth rather choose to sit in idle cell
Than so himself to mockery to sell.
Clearly this “Willie” is a person of tremend-
ous literary importance; equally clearly it
cannot be Shakspeare. “Willie” is dead in
the sense that he has retired to “idle cell.”
Shakspeare, if he wrote the plays, must have
done so at furious speed in a very few years
and is certainly not “dead” in 1590. Yet
at that very time de Vere had retired from
the glitter of the Court to his close private
occupations. Still, the matter would amount
to little if only on that thin conjecture stood
the claim of de Vere to be “Willie.” But
11 years earlier Spenser had published “The
Shepherd’s Calendar,” and Looney notes the
fact that “Willie” is also mentioned there—
at a time when William Shakspeare was 15.
There can be no doubt that it is the same
“Willie”; and by a most careful train of
reasoning Looney proves that the first
‘‘Willie” was de Vere. Spenser in the
“Calendar” mimics the writers he refers to.
In it “Willie” is made to say, “Hey, ho,
the pinching pain.” De Vere had previously
published the line, “Patience perforce is
such a pinching pain.” There is a lot more
in the matter than that, but the use of de
Vere’s very phrase by Spenser in the word*
he makes “Willie” say is the final proof of
the identity of “Willie” and de Vere. The
inference is that in Edmund Spenser’s view’,
in 1590, de Vere was the most prominent
writer of comedy in England.
Take another point. R. Warwick Bond is
the editor and chief authority on the works
of John Lyly, the author of “Euphues.” Of
Shakspeare and Lyly Bond says: “In
Comedy Lyly is Shakspeare’s only model:
the evidence of the latter’s study of him is
abundant.” But Lyly was de Vere’s pri-
vate secretary and the manager of his dra-
matic company, “The Oxford Boys.” The
tw r o men worked in the closest intimacy for
years; and while Lyly had no repute as a
writer of lyrics, fine lyrics in the style of
de Vere appear in his plays. One of these,
slightly altered, is in “Merry Wives.” Did
Shakspeare borrow this from a "writer who
v ns notoriously his inferior as a lyrist or
did do Vere assist in the writing of Lyly’s
plays and afterwards write “Merry Wives”
in which he incorporated his own earlier
verses 1
Now take a piece of argument of an
entirely different kind. If William Shaks-
peare, the Stratford boy w’ho ran away to
London because his wife had twins, were
really the author of the plays, he should
have known intimately the lives and thoughts
of the ordinary workaday people. Yet Shaks-
peare fails wherever he introduces such a
person. He does not even know the middld
classes; and the ordinary man who works
for a living or fights in the ranks is without
any exception treated as a fool or a clown.
On the other hand, Shakspeare, who could
have had no knowledge of the aristocracy, is
supposed to have written without an error
of detail about kings, princes, earls and
great statesmen; while the ways of a Court
came as second nature to him. De were was
Earl of Oxford, of a family better than that
of the Queen, was brought up at the Court
and knew intimately all its ways and all
the great men and women of the time. That
does not prove that de Vere wrote the plays;
but it looks very like proving that William
Shakspeare did not.
Anthony Monday is the first dramatist-
actor associated with de Vere and comes into
the picture as early as 15S0. Of Munday’s
work the “Cambridge History of English
Literature” says:—
Munday in 1580 and in his earliest published
works is anxious to proclaim himself “servant of
the Earl of Oxford”.... (much of a certain play)
might be Munday’s work, hut he cannot have written
the sonorous blank verse of the historic scenes....
And we find (in one of Munday’s plays) phrases
that might have rested in the mind of Shakspeare.
That means that in the critical view of a
modern scholar there is work in Munday’s
plays—some of them produced before Shaks-
peare left Stratford —which is-identical with
Shnkspeare’s work in form and style; and
this Munday is working with de Vere aud
the head of his dramatic company! Now
who wrote those passages in Munday’s plays?
Of the blank verse we can only guess; but
try this comparison :
From Munday’s play:
Lo! here the common fault of love, to follow her
that flies;
And fly from her that makes pursuit with loud,
lamenting cries.
Kedele loves Victoria, and she hath him forgot;
Virginia likes Fedele best, and he regards her not.
From de Vere’s poems:
The more I followed one, the more she fled away,
As Daphne did full long ago, Apollo’s wishful prey.
The more my plaints 1 do resound the less she
pities me.
The more 1 sought the less I found, yet mine she
meant to be.
From “Midsummer Night’s Dream”:
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
01 that your frowns would teach my smiles such
skill.
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
O 1 that my prayers could such affection move.
The more I hate the more he follows me.
The more I love the more he hateth me.
Again there is no proof; but the accumula-
tion of instance upon instance, all pointing
in the same direction, amounts to proof.
In a list of contemporary poets Francis
Meres in 1798 gives de Vere as “best for
Comedy.” He gives also a long list of
Shakspeare’s plays, but mentions no comedy
of the man who is “best.” Surely this is
significant. Either de Vere’s lost comedies
"are better than Shakspeare’s or those
described as Shakspeare’s are actually de
Vere’s.
The parallels between passages in the
plays and events in de Vere’s life create’ n
strong chain of probability as to his author-
ship. Looney identifies him in several ways
with Bertram in “All’s Well”; and the amaz-
ing story round which the plot revolves is
actually told of de Vere himself in Wright’s
“History of Essex.” In Hamlet, as might
he expected, the parallelism is closef' of all.
Horatio is his cousin, Horatio de Y_re, who
is described in contemporary prose almost
in the exact way in which he is described in
the play.
Then there is the matter of the pictures,
not quite convincing, but very remarkable.
A picture exists said to be that of Shaks-
peare at the age of 24. A picture of de
Vere at the age of 25 has been compared
with it. There is great probability that they
are the same face as represented by different
artists. Also Shakspeare is in aristocratic
dress; and at 24! Also the date under
Shakspeare’s portrait appears to have been
altered and the old figures under the newer
ones fit de Vere’s age.
Or, following another line, consider Shaks-
peare’s love for Italy. William Shakspeare
was never there, or at least there is no
evidence of it, and plenty of ground on which
the supposition would be absurd. De Vere,
on the other hand, loved Italy so greatly
that he dressed like an Italian and was
described in his own clay as an “Italianated
Englishman.” Two of Shakspeare’s char-
acters have rather unusual Italian names;
yet these very names are two out of a total
of three Which occur in de Vere’s letters
from Italy to his guardian, Burleigh.
There are hundreds of matters of a simi-
lar kind -which Looney has dug up and made
use of; and there are dozens of others so
slight and unconvincing that they weaken
his argument. The very fact, however, that
he has little literary skill in presenting his
story rather strengthens than detracts from
the real value of his discoveries. No single
item in the long book proves the case; but
I cannot escape from the conclusion that all
put together the points raised do prove it
and prove it completely.
It is easy to sneer such an author down
and continue to accept old Shakspearean
statements, many of which came to birth
a full century after his death. Looney has
no claim though he has more
feeling for poetry and the poet’s craft than
most scholars, but he uses modern scholars
with great effectiveness, and makes their
own words refute their own theories. Boiled
down the whole conclusion comes to this:
If Edward de Vere did not write the Shaks-
peare plays, then the only alternative is to
believe that in the days of Shakspeare there
lived another man of tremendous genius,
who was regarded by contemporaries as his
superior, whose work has been almost en-

Consecrated Ground.
When I built the wall and broke the sod
This garden was not made for God.
The soil was harsh, the days were stern;
But the living altar of rock and fern
And .stooping palm and leaf of fire
Whereat I minister as priest,
Back turned upon the sacred east,
Bore sacrifice of dear desire
For Eve, the priestess of that shrine
Whose flowers 1 tend, whose weeds are mine,
Oh, flaming bough ! Oh, branching rod !
This garden was not made for God,
But tilled of dreams and set of love
Till, through the quiet airs above,
God, breathing, felt the fragrance draw
The very heart of power and law.
The morning breezes scarce could bear
The growing ecstasy of prayer.
All holy things drew very near,
Heads bowed to earth to love and hear,
Till on a morning crisp and blue,
1 saw God’s footsteps in the dew.
The wind-flowers dance, the poppies nod-
This garden was not made for God.
The lawless riot of its gold
And purple set in silken sheen
Are words that spade to mattock told
Beneath the casements of a queen.
They lisped and whispered in the soil;
The brown seed fell, the pale blade grew;
The little roots, far-seeking, knew
The depth and purpose of the toil.
And ere the first white petal fell
God looked upon a dream dreamt well.
This garden was not made for God.
1 built the wall, I broke the sod ;
But God Himself at evening came
And all the garden felt 11 is name.
For love below a lilac tree
Sweetened the air to ecstasy.

Coming Back.
I had not known my soul for many days—
Fear-clouded days that racked my jaded
brain.
My songs were gone, and by the darkened
ways
I sought a weary while for ease of pain.
Across a troubled tide of bitter years
She seemed to reach to me her healing
hands.
Half-seen I felt her through a mist bf tears,
But lost her ever on the sobbing sands.
And was it poesy or love or youth
That made me yearn as one remembering
Something of beauty and child-wondering
truth,
Green-mantled from the girlhood of the
Spring?
I know not; but last night across the pain—
God’s pain that stays the pulse and chills
the mind— '
She beckoned me and called again, again,
Over a wailing darkness mercy-blind.
And was it sorrow, destiny or death.
Or grief so pale it made a little light?
She came so near, so near I felt her breath;
And God, remembering, made an end of
night.
I had not known my soul; but now I know.
Something of kinship in the trees and
skies
Is with me as the soft thoughts ebb and
flow.
I feel like some young child grown calm
and wise.

There is no sense in making life a sorrow
That grows with weariness of the speeding
years.
The sun that’s hidden to-day will shine to-
morrow.
There is no sense in tears.
There is no sense in turning from another
Who toils along beside us. Soon or late
We find in every fellow-man a brother.
There is no sense in hate.
There is no sense in dreading death. He
knows it
Who has most lived, most loved, most suf-
fered here.
When faltering life grows faint death comes
to close it.
There is no sense in fear.
There is no sense in sadness. Out of
reason
Is hate’s fierce rancor. Yet awhile we
roam
These trampled ways and sweet. Then in
due season
Death gently leads us home.

Incorrigible.
When I was young I thought the world
A golden bud with petals curled
That one day would unfold for me
So I might sip quite fairyly,
When once the magic cup unfurled.
The sweets upon its rim empearled.
The pipes of Pan so blithely skirled ;
There was no end to what might be
When I was young!
And then the years about me whirled,
Until from childhood I was hurled
Into the world’s reality.
To find my dreams still fair and free
As those that round me tripped and twirled
When I was young!

THE PERI AT THE TRADES HALL
GATE.
The new Labor Government of N. S. Wales
settled down in the Treasury benches last
week; and one of the first things which
became apparent was that it does not intend
to consider an executive system differing
in any respect from the old one. The party
represents about one-half of 50 per cent, of
the electors, and it is going to govern the
State as if it had a genuine mandate. That
is to say. it will legislate and administer
in accordance with the views of a com-
paratively small section of the workers. The
new Administration will take its orders in
most of the things that matter from mili-
tant unionism. And that means mainly from
the skilled toilers, such as slaters, carpenters,
painters and bricklayers, to mention a few
classes which are very much in the public
eye just now. Little attention will be paid,
in practice, to the unorganised masses who
have as much hope of getting into unions
as they have of getting into the Union Club.
These comprise all sorts of citizens, ranging
from small manufacturers and shopkeepers
to many of the 8000 unemployed who, ac-
cording to the N. S. Wales Director of Labor
Exchanges, are in Sydney at the present
time. It may be said that this is an un-
fair presentation of the case, that Premier
Storey and his colleagues are humanitarians
with an eye to th-e interests of the humblest.
But as industrialism has been shaping for
several years past, it is practically impos-
sible for a largely union-elected Government
to look beyond the unions.
What likelihood, for example, is there of
the StoUEY Government doing more than ex-
press mild regret at the continual strikes
which may slightly inconvenience the capi-
talist (and they don’t always do as much even
as that), but which bring starvation and ruin
on thousands at the other end of the social
scale? There are two alternative ideas
behind a basic-industry strike such as the
railway upheaval which was arranged to
synchronise with the Prince of Wales’s visit
to Maoriland. The first is anarchy: as far
back as IS6S a Brussels Labor Congress laid
it down that “if only production could be
arrested for a sufficient period Society could
not exist.” Anarchy is not a force worth
considering at present anywhere in Aus-
tralasia, so it may be taken that the unions
which so freely wield the strike-weapon are
influenced by the second motive—callous sel-
fishness. The M.L. railway workers demand
a 50 per cent, increase all round. If they
get it there is nothing to stop them going-
after another similar increase, and another.
The rises can only be paid for in increased
rates. Every wage-earner will, in that event,
suffer (1) indirectly as a unit of the nation
which owns the railways, (2) directly in
raised fares and freights and the swollen
cost of every commodity which reaches him
by rail. The “privileged classes,” the repre-
sentatives of the new Capitalism, won’t be
greatly injured, if permanently injured at all.
Those organised workers who are outside the
Railway men’s Union will immediately adjust
matters by further strikes in their industries.
But what of the impotent herd —the vast body
which is in no position to so help itself? The
latter class is not made up of isolated hand-
fuls of wasters. Even in Sydney’s 8000 un-
employed there are 3000 returned soldiers,
mostly men who went to the war before they
were old enough to have learned a trade, and
are now in the unskilled or casual-laborer
class. Other thousands are men who, in-
stead of apprenticing themselves to a trade,
were tempted into one of the “blind alley”
callings. They will never become trades-
men now; and the class to which they have
the misfortune to belong is increasing in pro-
portion as the rising cost of living makes it
harder and harder for parents to support
their boys through the apprenticeship period.
So that out of this country’s advanced and
highly-specialised civilisation there is emerg-
ing a helot class whose position is not much
better, materially, than that of the poorer
English workers when the Combination
Laws were passed. Able-bodied men have
to petition for food. They seek frantically
for the only sort of work they are capable
of doing; and even when they get it the re-
muneration turns out to be inadequate. Four
pounds sterling per week would have been
considered a princely wage by a casual
laborer before the war; but with skilled labor
earning £lO and £l2 a week it becomes a
difficult sum to live on, fnore particularly
when, as the result of a strike in one of the
great striking industries, it is withheld for
weeks at a time.
* * * *
Who in the N. S. Wales Parliament, or
for _ that matter in any of the Parliaments,
is in a position to battle for this big and
growing section? The capitalist representa-
tives might. But, like the “free” worker,
the capitalist is beginning to find himself
on the defensive most of his time. Trade
unions were illegal associations a century
ago. To-day it is capitalism that is suspect,
even if it isn’t presumed definitely to be
guilty; and by so much its advocacy of any
cause is weakened. But, apart from that,
organised Labor has no intention of allowing
outsiders to butt in. Its enthusiasm for an
Elective Ministry system, which would bring
the flower of every Parliament into the
Cabinet, regardless of party, has invariably
departed with the arrival of a Labor
majority. So in N. S. Wales, as elsewhere,
Labor stands more or less openly for an
oligarchy. But an oligarchy, if it is to
succeed for any length of time, must be based
either on force—the main support of the
military oligarchs in war-time —or on the
respect and approval of the multitude. Our
union oligarchs are not backed by military
force; and Australians being the sort of
people they are, the position is not likely
to alter in that respect. On the other
hand, their activities, of late, have not been
such as to gain the confidence of the com-
munity. Those who are doomed to watch
them from outside the fold wonder lugubri-
ously what the game is; and, so far, no
satisfactory answer has been forthcoming.
Are they after revolution, and employing to
that end the old recipe of “strike upon
strike, blow upon blow, till the capitalist
State is destroyed”? The Bulletin does
not believe they are. Then is it their de-
sign to use their organisation indefinitely
for wage-raising purposes, compelling the
employers—whether State or private enter-
prise—to put up prices to the detriment of
the unorganised? This paper hesitates also
to believe that. The intolerable position in
which those people find themselves who are
typified by many of the witnesses before the
different Basic Wages Commissions is an
affair partly of muddled thinking, partly of
unwillingness to face facts. Assume that
no reasonable Australian wants anarchy,
and that no decent unionist desires to batten
on the rest of the workers. In either £>f
those cases it is up to the spokesmen of the
great unions to step forward and say exactly
what it is they do want, and to supply some
sort of constructive policy for achieving it.
Must private enterprise of the old Spen-
cerian type be emasculated? To the operat-
ing table with ill Is State Socialism a
failure? Let it go! But in either con-
tingency something else must be offered to
replace the system which is scrapped. An
industrial existence made up of “lightning
strikes,” followed by 50 per cent, rises in
wages, is as impracticable as a permanent
diet of champagne and truffles. If the great
unions are ever to be anything worthier in
the nation’s eyes than bodies existing for the
purpose of wrangling with employers about
money, they will presently have to state their
aims, not only with regard to the industries
of the country, but also in relation to those
who are outside their own ranks. If the
union bosses intend that unionists shall have
a share, on equitable terms, in the concerns
in which they are employed, they have only to
say so. “Anything for peace” is. broadly,
the producer’s motto. “Anything for stable
prices” is the cry of the stricken, fixed-wage
consumer. “Anything, so long as I know
definitely what I have got to face,” is asked
by the would-be manufacturer who is holding
off, to the great loss —even perhaps to the
national peril—of the country.
THE “CRAZY MANIA FOR POWER.”
There was a characteristic pulpit pro-
nouncement on the League of Nations at
Bathurst a few days ago:—
The League is an attempt to realise a great ideal,
but unless the mad race for markets and the crazy
mania for power give place to dignified reverence for
international citizenship, this lofty ideal of a Chris-
tian Commonwealth of Nations must end in an
inglorious fiasco.
Hundreds of good men are uttering the
same edifying generalities all over the Com-
monwealth. But they fail to carry their
theories to a logical conclusion in any one
specified direction. It is an easy and obvi-
ous thing to reprobate “mad races” and
“crazy manias.” Everyone will agree in a
general way that they are undesirable. It
is a simple matter, similarly, to acclaim the
ideal of “a Christian Commonwealth of
Nations.” And if the Pagan nations could
be included the scheme would be even more
admirable. But it is another thing to take
any one market, or any one sphere of power,
and demand in the name of morality that it
shall be given up. Yet unless individual
markets and powers are sacrificed right and
left by the nations which have come out on
top, then it is plain that the beautiful dream
of a Commonwealth of well-content nations
will remain a dream.
* * » *.
Take the handy case of Ireland. There
are very good material reasons why the
British Empire should hold Ireland. Not
such strong ones as existed before Germany
was hammered, but still strong enough. Ire-
land is, in the phrase of the old chronicler,
“England's bottress.” It is “the key to the
Atlantic.” But the retention of Ireland can-
not be supported on moral grounds. It
was invaded originally by the English much
as Belgium was invaded by the Germans.
Racially, and in their religion, 80 per cent,
of the Irish are as distinct from their mas-
ters on the other side of the Channel as the
Belgians of Brussels are distinct from the
Prussians. The desire of the remaining 20
per cent.- —the Ulster Unionists —to preserve
the English connection is only a modern de-
velopment. In the 18th century and during
part of the 19th Presbyterian Ulster was as
separatist as any other province. “Bel-
fast,” wrote the notorious General Lake,
ought to be proclaimed and punished most
severely. It is plain that every act of sedi-
tion originates in this town.” He did his
work of repression so well that by the time
the era of Union approached, the more virile
part of Protestant Ulster was in America.
American Independence was won, to a great
extent, on those ruined fields of the “four
counties,” which are now being used as an
argument why Ireland should never be in-
dependent. And none demand it more
fiercely than some of those clerics who de-
nounce “the crazy mania for power” and call
for a “dignified reverence for international
citizenship.”
* * * *
And what do those who deplore this crazy
mama for power say about the evacuation
of Egypt by the British? Perhaps ninety-
nine times out of a hundred they will be
found hostile to the sacrifices The
possession of Egypt is important strategically
and trom a trade standpoint. It is still the
Clapham Junction of the world: the main
roads to Africa, to India and to the Empire’s
new sphere of influence in Persia radiate
from it. And there is the Canal to be held.
It stands for Imperial security as well as
for an incalculable amount of trade. Yet
all sections and classes of Egyptians, as rep-
resented by the three main divisions—Mos-
lems, Copts and Christians—are passionately
Nationalist. They want the British to get
out, a step which Gladstone promised the
French and which Asquith promised the
Khedive would be taken. It would be
relatively safe to eyacuate Egypt now. Tur-
key being impotent to do the Empire any
real harm in the field. But there is no
demand from the pulpits that the step should
be taken. Then there is the case of Persia.
It is differently situated from Egypt, inas-
much as it is nominally a sovereign State
and as such figured at the Peace Conference;
nevertheless Persia is in reality British
property. The British Government controls
the Customs, the oil-fields and the transport
—a very good thing for us, since the land
route from Europe to India lies through
Persia, since also it is an extremely
rich country, and it is not a bad thing for
the Persians. Yet the Persians don’t see it.
They are Sinn Feiners like the Irish and
the Egyptians; and for the same reason.
Government by alien angels is no satisfac-
tory substitute for self-government in the
eyes of a self-respecting race. Our late
allies the French are getting ready for
another war in Syria. Under the Sykes-
Picot treaty Britain guaranteed France that
it should have Syria, regardless of the senti-
ments of the Syrians—all of whom, barring
the Roman Catholic Lebanonese, detest the
idea of French rule. The Emir Feisal has
proclaimed himself king of an independent
Syria, and Britain is sitting back, embar-
rassed, and saying nothing. If ethics were
the only consideration the British Govern-
ment would side with Feisal, who fought
under Allenby against the Turks. But
what our moral mentors call “the mad race
for markets and the crazy mania for power”
are involved, and the Empire does not inter-
fere. Nor, so far as TnE Bulletin is
aware, has a solitary divine or other director
of the public conscience claimed that it
should interfere.
* * * *
There is a remarkable resemblance between
the new League of Nations and the old Cob-
denite Freetrade propaganda. The pre-
requisite as regards both is that everybody
should start to make sacrifices together for
the benefit of feeble or unprogressive nations.
Modern Egypt is enthusiastic about self-
determination : it can’t fight. Central Africa
believes in Freetrade : it doesn’t manufacture.
But humanity is not going to change its spots
because one country is cowardly, or another
lazy and unenterprising. The British Empire
can truthfully claim to have fought the
late war for freedom: that is to say, pri-
marily, for its own freedom. Freedom is a
material asset, as material as a credit
balance in a bank. It is expressed, amongst
other things, as territory and in the capacity
to reach territory—or, in other words, in
Trade. There is Imperial territory which
for various reasons is probably not worth
holding. Notably Ireland. Ireland provides
considerably more scandal than it is worth;
and its relinquishment would involve no
great peri] as the Powers are now balanced.
But to argue that Britain from “a dignified
reverence for international citizenship"
should give up or get out of all the myriad
little subject countries which it holds by
protectorates, mandates and the like —well,
such a counsel of perfection is outside the
province of practical business. And if it is
not intended that the Empire of which we
form a part should so act, but only France
or Italy, or Japan, then the proposition is
self-evidently absurd. The civilised world
went Protectionist, though the United King-
dom provided it with the example of a
revenue tariff: the nations are not going to
become internationalist so long as Britain
denies nationality to races of every religion
and color. The League of Nations is thus
eminently a subject for the Churches to
leave alone until such time as they produce
another Savanorola, who, careless of the
effect of his observations on the collection-
plate, will drop vague and soothing plati-
tudes and reveal the logical implications of
Internationalism. There is horrible danger
in dealing with the matter in any other way.
THE BAR AND THE BENCH.
Nobody is justified in attributing to me the
absurd idea that the less law a Judge knows
the better. There is the law of to-day, and
the law of the past. In claiming that a
knowledge of human nature, as it is around
us to-day, is more important for the admin-
istration of justice than historical research,
I am hitting at the most glaring evil in
legal training. I am, however, merely repeat-
ing the opinion expressed by a well-known
Oxford professor of English law, with whose
ideas educated lawyers are generally familiar.
He writes that in the province of law "the
analysis of human nature as it exists is of
infinitely more importance than research into
the annals of the past.” Notwithstanding
this truism, the training of our lawyers is so
misdirected that historical research is made
to appear infinitely more important than the
analysis of human nature. Historical
research deserves a place in legal education,
but no higher place than ancient history
holds in modern politics or statesmanship.
There are four pillars supporting our legal
system, which is the most antiquated, the
most feudal, the most cumbersome and the
most costly in the world. These pillars are
the Solidarity of Bench and Bar, Trial by
Jury, Trial by J’s.P. and Ignorance.
The objection to the appointment of bar-
risters as Judges is not a novel one.
If we except the Anglo-Saxon world,
it is a world-wide objection. In all
countries, except Anglo-Saxon ones, Judges
are required to be specially trained
for judicial work, and barristers can-
not become Judges without that train-
ing. In Anglo-Saxon countries, in the
promotion of barristers to be Judges,
in the selection of men as honorary
J’s.P., in the choosing of a jury of 12
men or a lesser number,, there is not the
slightest effort made to ascertain whether
the persons are competent to discharge
judicial functions. In Anglo-Saxon coun-
tries generally the appointment of a parti-
cular barrister is a job done by the political
party in power. J’s.P. in most cases are
appointed through the jobbery of the local
politician. And jurymen are- driven into the
jury-box like a mob of sheep.
Barristers and Judges are not possessed
of a monopoly of the judicial faculty. They
are no more free from bias and prejudice
than any other class. The London Times
wrote recently:—
We could name Judges who it was freely said
strove as advocates on the Bench more than at the
Bar ; who could not always forget that they had been
party-men; and who to the last showed when they
got the chance that they had been faithful to their
first love —politics.
Some of these characteristics are seen in
the judicial bench in Australia. Sir Edward
Clarke tells us his opinion of Judge Sir
Henry Hawkins’s fitness for the Bench:
“He had no notion of what justice meant, or
of the obligations of truth and fairness.”
Yet Sir Henry Hawkins was an ornament
of the English Bar. London Punch reflects
public opinion. Some time ago it repre-
sented the Lord Chancellor saying to a
friend: “Oh, by the way, I think I ought
to tell you why I made a Judge. It’s
a splitter!” (He tells it and the meeting
is dissolved in laughter.) , Mr. Sidney Low
writes: “The successful barrister is not, as
a rule, a person of exceptional endowments.
He is just an ordinary, intelligent, profes-
sional man who happens to belong to a close
trade union which has been allowed by law
and custom to exclude competition except
amongst its own favored members.”
The lawyers use the terms “trained
lawyer” in a way that is misleading, and
imposes upon the Anglo-Saxon world. A
specially-trained judiciary is a different body
from a Bench composed of barristers trained
only in the work of practising barristers.
Lord Brampton boasted that his greatest
delight was to obtain the acquittal
of someone whose guilt nobody could
doubt —a perfect illustration of bar-
rister morals! The barrister-judge may
have been an advocate whose years of legal
training have involved him in the indiscrimi-
nate defence of right and wrong, and fre-
quently in the knowing suppression of
truth—a “legal training” which Dr. Arnold
considered leads to moral perversion. Or
he may have been “a profound constitutional
lawyer,” deeply read in legal archaeology —
a course of study which fills his mind with
mediarval ideas and methods, and which is
responsible for most of the abuses of to-day.
Or he may have been an Equity practitioner,
with a training which will be no help to
him in the judicial functions of the Criminal
Court. But whether advocate, legal pedant
or Equity practitioner, the barrister-judge
is severely handicapped and hindered as
regards judicial training. lie is a man with
a very bad past for a Judge who has to deal


with the problems of the day, and who has
to face the future. By far the most import-
ant business before Australia is the

are not handicapped with the mediaevalism o
the barrister, and are not reponsible, as tne
barrister-Judges are. for imposing the mediae-
val system upon the public. They are igno-
rant,‘biased and prejudiced as the juries are
also. The bias of barristers is a different
bl In the British Empire there are civilian
Judges who are successful as Judges because
they are very highly trained administrators.
The members of the judicial branch of the
Indian Civil Service have a record incom-
parably better than that of their barrister
colleagues. Their training has nothing to
do with archaeology or advocacy, but every-
thing to do with human nature and govern-
ment in India.
Trial by jury is a failure. It does not
follow, however, that some forms of trial by
jury might not be made to serve the country.
Trial by jury is not now a safeguard. It
in a trap.
History teems with the failure of lawyers
to get at the heart of things, because their
legal system has prevented them. For more
than 1500 years the lawyers maintained that
the crime of witchcraft was clearly estab-
lished in the evidence given in witchcraft
trials. “Sound lawyers,” whose lives were
spent in sifting evidence, investigated the
ouestion on countless occasions, and con-
demned the accused. Tens of thousands of
victims perished by the most agonising and
protracted torments. The evidence perfectly
satisfied these very unbusinesslike and incom-
petent Judges that an old woman who had
been seen riding a broomstick or had been
transformed into a wolf had devoured the
sheep in the neighborhood. The Judges were
the highest in the land — Hale, and Coke,
and Bacon, so revered by the lawyers. We
had witchcraft trials up to 1712 —not so
very long ago. And our lawyers would still
be witch-hunting if some civilians had not
compelled them to stop these prosecutions.
The barrister still dresses up in his mediae-
val costume, and continues to put a bundle
of false hair on the top of his head to remind
us that he is a relic of medievalism. Other
relics remain with us. Our system of ap-
pointing barrister-Judges is medieval, the
Bar trades union is medieval, and so are
our J’s.P. and Trial by Jury. The public
is in servitude to the priesthood of the law,
to an exclusive caste. Is it not time that
Australians moved to make the legal profes-
sion serve the people, rather than the people
serve the legal profession? Never forget,
writes George Bernard Shaw, that if you
take your law from Judges, and your religion
from bishops, you will find yourselves pre-
sently without law or religion.
A LAWYER.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Throne and Its Stupid Friends.
Presumably it is not their deliberate pur-
pose to make the Prince’s .visit have pre-
cisely the opposite effect to what was in-
tended ; but that is what the so-called “loy-
alists” are doing. Even before thrones be-
gan to topple at the end of the war it was
felt by the supporters of the monarchy in
England that kings and princes were in a
nerilous position. At that time almost the
whole responsibility for the war was thrown
upon the Kaiser. A policy was then drawn
up for the King and Queen and their family.
They were to show that they were not the
Kaiser kind at all —that they were intensely
human and deeply concerned in the every-
day life of the people. This policy doubtless
conformed to their own wishes. “The right
divine to govern wrong” could no longer be
maintained. The Royal family had to show
that it was good value for the nation’s
money. And a very fair case could be made
out for the institution. It was, in theory,
utterly ridiculous and all that; yet in hard
practice it could, be shown to serve fairly
well. But it was above all things necessary
to dissociate it entirely from a lot of
familiar Royal surroundings. The old order
of government has changed. In England no
less than in Australia the people have be-
come the rulers. They were so to a very
large extent before the war: they are.more
completely so since. It was these new rulers
who had to be convinced that the monarchi-
cal institution was a practical advantage.
It was to appeal to these new rulers that
the King and his Queen did during and
immediately after the war a thousand things
which even they would not have thought of
doing 20, even 10, years ago. It is to strengthen
and widen this appeal that the Prince is
being sent on his journeys; and those who
want to see the Throne made a little more
secure on its foundations are doing it the
worst possible service in not keeping that
fact steadily in mind. Thus far, instead of
any serious attempt being made to assist
the Prince to rope in friends for the cause
he represents, the proceedings have generally
been of such a character as to suggest that
no world-change has been taken note of.
The papers fill their pages with maudlin
rubbish which can simply be repellent to
those whose good opinion—or at least tolera-
tion —of the monarchical system is so eagerly
sought; while what passes for Society puts
forward a sort of claim to special pro-
prietary rights in the young Royal visitor,
and a more damaging thing than that from
the point of view of the promoters of the
tour it is not possible to conceive.
*
This Picture and That.
There are whole volumes of political econ-
omy in the daily papers, and superficial dig-
ging reveals rich deposits of instruction.
These two parallel reefs were uncovered in
one recent issue :
A storekeeper on the Culcairn-Corowa line who
has been trading for many years with Sydney whole-
sale warehouses returned home the other day from
the city with three dozen pairs of ladies’ cotton
hose. He had tried in vain to get more.... For the
hose he sold at 9d. a pair a few years ago he now
had to ask 4s. 6d “Fancy that piece of serge—
only a yard and a half —costing me 30s. Gd.! 1
used to sell that serge at 4s. 6d. per yard; to-day
it is a guinea a yard to buy.” He threw the little
parcel on the scale to weigh the wool. There was
barely 141 b.
And the other :
Travelled by coach 170 miles from Cobar to Wil-
cannia... .Over a tract of country about 300 miles
wide there was only one Government tank with
water.... They were putting up the bravest fight
that he had witnessed by men and women on the
land.... People were carrying water for domestic
purposes a distance of 40 miles. Long stretches of
the Darling River had dried up... .Recently an
effort was made to urge the Government to bring
the bare necessaries of life to White Cliffs. The
people were paying 9s. for 100 gallons of water.
There is something heroic in the fight that
is being put up by the people on that (IS,OOO
square miles (170 by 400) with a Govern-
ment tank still holding out proudly in the
centre. And there is something heroic about
the person who goes out to fight crocodiles
and other unsaleable animals with his bare
hands —something heroic and mad and mis-
guided. For this drought is not a thing that
happens once in 1000 years. It is periodi-
cal and frequent, and in some parts it is
permanent. And it isn’t for lack of
highly profitable and reliable and rea-
sonably pleasant work that people are
beguiled out to do the useless gal-
lantry act on the run of perdition. There
are oceans of work. There is room for
dozens of new woollen factories, and it is for
want of them that the importer is able to
charge 21s. per yard wholesale for a doled-
out fragment of serge which could be made
locally at 7s. Gd. and pay most handsomely
at that. But little can be done while'the
importing interest runs most of the country’s
press and politics, and beguiles people at
great expense into the wilderness, while its
Labor allies cripple Australian industries
with incessant strikes and threats of confis-
cation.
States and Territories.
Mention has been made in Parliament of a
scheme for subdividing Australia into 31
States, with a small. one-House Legislature
apiece. The only objection is that perhaps
half of Australia shouldn’t be divided into
States at all, but should constitute a
Federal territory. N. S. Wales got a glim-
mering of this idea when it marked off its
Western Division and put it in charge of
commissioners, and guessed its value at 2s.
(id. per acre. Yet the Western Division has
Broken Hill for a sheet anchor, and it is
traversed by Australia’s longest river, and
includes the Valley of the Darling, whereas
the greater part of Westralia is the Iliver-
less Land and isn’t the valley of anything, and
the country east of that is the Lake Eyre
basin, where the few alleged streams culmi-
nate in some spoonsful of brine in S. Aus-
tralia. The innards of the continent were
cut into States before anybody had the
faintest idea that they constituted the biggest
dry area in the British Empire. Two-
thirds of Australia was under robust Parlia-
mentary Government before more than one-
third of it was really explored, and S. Aus.
in particular didn’t have a look at a quarter
of its property till it had been ruling it
with a Ministry and an Opposition and other
forms and figments for quite a long time.
This interior, even the worst of it, must
have railways and airship stations, for the
good lands and the ports on each side must
be connected, and the way across, provided
it doesn’t hug the coast like the western
transcontinental, is a valuable and economi-
cal short-cut. Besides, there is a sort of
blessed oasis in the Macdonnell Ranges, in
the centre, and lesser oases in other parts.
But the bad interior doesn’t want an Oppo-
sition or a Chairman of Committees any
more than the Antarctic does. Being an
unavoidable calamity it should be the com-
mon calamity, whereas at present two States
carry the bulk of it and have too little good
country to stand the cost.
Suppose the Renown Needed Docking?
At a time which is not far distant this
country, if it be given a fair chance, will
be building merchant ships in large num-
bers. It will be sending away in them
manufactured goods of great value as well
as primary products, and bringing back in
repayment raw materials and money. When
that time comes it will be necessary to
have an adequate navy for the protection
of the national property. If such a navy
could be improvised, as in a sense an army
can be, there would be some justification
in waiting till our mercantile marine has
developed. But a modern navy is the work
not of years but of decades. In order to
satisfactorily fulfil its destiny it must grow
side by side with the nation’s commerce.
Jellicoe, envisaging the Pacific as it
emerged from the world war, saw that it is
in for a record expansion of business —
not 10 or 20 years hence, but at once. He
drew up his scheme with that in view.
Any of the Dominions which accepted the
arrangement would be entering into a good
bargain, since, under it, Britain, while
shouldering 75 p.c. of the financial lia-
bility, becomes responsible for the protec-
tion of the whole. Australia is asked to
contribute less than 8 p.c. The apportion-
ment was made on the Commonwealth pre-
war volume of trade. Parliament has since
imposed a fairly stiff Protective tariff; and
the history of all Protectionist countries
with seaboards goes to show that expansion
of overseas trade follows the duty. This ap-
plies alike in a barren country which is
near the world’s markets, such as Ger-
many, and in a rich one which is distant
from them, such as the U.S.A. If Aus-
tralia jumped straight into the Jellicoe
scheme to-day it would achieve at a com-
paratively small cost, whether for purposes
of actuai defence off for diplomatic discus-
sion, the use of a fleet which might reason-
ably be termed unbeatable. So far, how-
ever. the Commonwealth Government has
committed itself to no more than a hesi-
tant hint that, in certain eventualities, the
business of dock-construction at the Bases
may be undertaken. Here, at any rate, is
a point on which there should be no dis-
agreement. To decline to supply our quota
of ships is equivalent to the economy of
one who refuses to insure the inflammable
building which contains all his worldly
goods. To turn down the Base proposi-
tion as well is something like settl ng the
family in the place and cutting off the
water supply. The Australia, which is
already a poor thing as capital ships go, can
only just get into the biggest dock in the
Commonwealth. The Renown would fail to
do it by about half its length. So that
without Bases the mighty ships of to-day
—the 25,000 to 30,000 tonners —can come
here on flying visits only. Even if Aus-
tralia’s politicians are afraid of the cost of
an efficient Australian Navy and a demon-
strably sound defence scheme, they can
hardly balk for much longer at. the other
proposition. If they do it will mean not
only that we don’t mean to defend either
our country or its trade, but that we won’t
even provide the British Navy with facili-
ties to do it for us.

The Missing Child.
The question of the “basic wage” which is
supposed to be sufficient for a man and wife
and an average family of three dependent
children keeps cropping up in all manner of
places till it becomes a worse nuisance than
ever. The obvious fact is that a family
which is 200 or 300 per cent, above the
average can’t live on the average victuals,
and one that is 66 per cent, below would
get a pain in the pinny if it ate them. The
last time inhabitants were counted there
were in Australia 735,849 married males
(fathers or possible fathers of orthodox
families), including three kids under 15.
There were 63,675 widowers and 2360
divorced men. making 801,884 presumable
heads of families. Then 128,00 S widows had
to be counted as representing the house-
father who had gone before, so 929,952 fami-
lies were shown. The census-man says that
the supporting age begins at 15. This is
about as absurd as the fiction of the aver-
age family; but assuming that it is right
there were 1,407,018 unmarried children to be
supported, or about 1$ per family. If every
unmarried person (divorced persons barred)
under 21 was called a dependent child, then
the army mustered 1,929,653, or only a
shade over two per family—about 860,000
short. And that is overdoing things badly,
for to call every bachelor and spinster aged
20 years and 364 days a dependent is an-
other absurdity. Some are burglars before
they attain that age. In 1918 there were,
among mothers aged less than 29,11.491 who
gave birth to their third child; 6062 who
gave birth to their fourth ; 2798 who brought
their fifth child into the world ; 1097 their
sixth; 369 their seventh ; while 130 became
the mothers of anything from the eighth to
the twelfth infant, all these children, or all
that survived, being obviously of the depen-
dent age. An all-round wage that would
adequately meet the cases of these mothers,
especially the final 130, would be so higln
that all industry would stop. And there
would be no wage at all. And one based on
the real average of about two or the bogus
artificial average of three is calculated to
drive a most valuable section of the com-
munity to starvation or suicide, and to make
a wreck of the birth-rate. There is no logical
way out ' except to fix the living wage at
what is supposed to be sufficient to support
a man and woman and perhaps two children
(or else one child or no child) and pay
an allowance (not out of loan money) for
the rest of the family (or the whole family),
the earnings of the man who is his own
employer being regarded as wages, and a
widow being a man for the purposes of the
Act. On any other basis the living wage is
an ass. In fact, it is so large an ass that
it is really more like a dromedary.

Keeping Track of the Alien.
The Registration of Aliens Bill, which
arouses so much fury among a class that can
see the rights of everybody except the white
Australian of British descent, is a strictly
logical answer to a mountain of piffle about
the universal brotherhood of the workers of
the world. There is an Immigration law to
keep out undesirables; nevertheless too many
undesirables get in, their drawbacks not be-
ing recognised in time. Now it is proposed
to keep a perpetual index of the alien, so that
he can always be found and identified and
deported when he does something too extra-
ordinary or too suspicious, and to record his
children also, so that they can be traced if
they conduct themselves too much like the
old man. The stranger is to live under his
own name unless permitted to change it, and
a record may be kept of his finger-prints as
well as of his footprints. Australia is, in
short, coming-in spots—to a belated re-
cognition that the alien is a very real danger,
and that in some cases his children and even
his grand-children are not any better.
Broadly, the alien who needs to be watched
(and we cannot watch him unless we know
where he is) is of two sorts. First there is
the home-loving alien, who has no use or
love for any other country except as a place
to make money in, and who intends to take
the profits back with him ; but presently, find-
ing his profit hard to shift, he is liable to aim
at annexing the country and making it part of
his own. This kind may be of great value to
the new country he is working in—so long as
he is watched and doesn’t get bad ideas into
his head. Then there is the home-hating
alien, and he is of less than no value, for he
generally loathes and conspires against the
most kindly and liberal and democratic form
of government because it is a government,
all systems being bad to him because he once
lived under a bad one. This sort usually
makes politics a profession in foolish coun-
tries which, like Australia, allow him to
interfere with or talk about their politics.
He is a thousand times more dangerous to
a liberal and generous country than to a
brutal autocracy, because the autocracy gaols
him at sight and the other sort doesn’t.
Moreover in a democracy there are always
politicians of the scum variety with high
moral pretensions, who advocate the exten-
sion of the franchise to the foreign anarchist,
because they regard themselves as the sort
of scum he will naturally try to put in power
when he gets a vote. Every alien who can’t
be fully accounted for otherwise should be
suspected of being a person whom his own
country and probably a lot of other countries
think themselves better without, and mostly
these other countries are right. The pro-
portion of good peonle isn’t so large that
any unknown individual cud be taken on
trust. And the number of countries that
have been annexed, more or less peacefully,
primarily through the efforts of the alien
who has been allowed to settle within them,
is so great that we must regard that as a
danger too.
The Wounds of France.
The Hun whines greatly these days about
his hardships, and kindly, soft-headed people
begin to be impressed and say that a bloke
shouldn’t be* hit when he is down. Quite
a variety of expounders on Anzac Sunday
expressed their readiness to forgive the in-
juries the Huns had done to other people
and remit the debt owing to other people —
expressed this Christian sentiment in whole
or in part. As a matter of fact the Hun is
very much up; it is France that is patheti-
cally down. France lost one-ninth of its
population during the war, either dead or put
out of the self-supporting class and economi-
cally dead. It has lost one-fifth of its
revenue, in the sense that the area which
furnished that proportion is for the time
incapable of furnishing anything worth men-
tioning. And whether a big section of
northern France is or is not a desert and a
waste for generations no one can say yet.
There are no precedents to go upon. No
one —not Attila nor Gengiiiz Khan nor
Tamerlane —ever made such desolation, for
though they had the will they lacked the
apparatus. No one can be a complete devil
without apparatus. When William the
Conqueror went fanti or must and ran amok
(one has to hunt in colored languages for
the right word) he made such a burnt cinder
and unutterable desolation of Northern
England that his footsteps could be traced
100 years later. It may be Unit they can
be traced now', for Northern England, w'hich
was .supposed to be the most populous part
of the country in Roman days, hasn’t got
back to that position. Yet William had
only a few hurried months to give to the job.
He didn’t wreck the coal-mines, for there
were none, or blow up towns and factories
with dynamite or sweep them with cannon,
for he had neither. Like Gengiiiz and Attii.a
and Tamerlane, William ravaged feebly
bv hand. A land which has been blown up ;
which has had its arable soil and top-dress-
ing washed away or deeply buried and utter
barrenness brought to the surface —a land on
which iron has rained from Heaven for more
than four years—is quite a new proposition.
Belgium practically escaped, for it was a
battle-ground for a few weeks only; and,
besides, the Hun hoped almost to the last
to retain Belgium and didn’t want to destroy
his prospective property. Neither in Russia
nor in Italy was a big region fought over
from the first to the last by huge, well-pro-
vided armies. France stands alone in the
world and in history. Even Sodom and
Gomorrah quite possibly didn’t have so much
dropped on them ; nor Pompeii and Hercu-
laneum. Yet none of these places has re-
covered. Germany grows more truculent
and shows more signs of arming for a new
war every day. It has surrendered none of
the war criminals. It has stopped the sup-
ply of coal to France, whose own mines have
been destroyed. When Joachim of Hohen-
zollern organised a squad of aristocratic
hoodlums to insult and assault French and
British people in Berlin a Hun Court put
its tongue in its cheek and fined him 1800
marks—about £7 10s. at present values. So
desolated France doesn’t see eye to eye with
these mild folk who preach that hate should
not be eternal, and that the hatchet should
be buried. On present signs German hate
has hardly begun, and the hatchet has been
buried too deeply already.
«.
Davey Hall.
The Storey Government has made it clear
that it will dismiss Davey Hall from his
office of N. S. Wales Agent-General, to which
he was lately appointed for five years by
the Holman Government. This introduces
a system which may have most unpleasant
consequences. There is no doubt about “the
Crown’s” prerogative. It can sack any pub-
lic servant other than the Judges at any-
time without compensation. But though it
may be necessary to reserve this power to
the Crown —for use, say, in times of financial
crisis, when money for salaries is not avail-
able —it will demoralise the service if the
prerogative is exercised for no better reason
than that the officer dismissed was of the
wrong political color and was appointed by
another political party. Party is mis-
chievous enough Avlien it confines its opera-
tions to the Legislature; but if it is to
operate also in the public service, then the
impartiality of the service will be at an end.
Hall should not have been appointed; but
since he was appointed, unless the appoint-
ment can be clearly shown to have been due
to corruption, it should either stand or the
man should be compensated. And the Gov-
ernment should make it quite clear that it
gets rid of him, not because he was appointed
by another political party, but because it
believes that a previous Government made
a mistake in choosing him. Even, however,
if it regards him as unqualified for the job,
it cannot in any offhand manner tear up a
previous Government’s appointment without
imperilling the State’s chances of securing
and holding the best men for public services.
No Government would dare to tear up a
contract made by a previous Government
for, say, supplies or for public works. When
the infamous Norton Griffiths contract
was cancelled there was no thought of doing
it without offering compensation. It is mon-
strous that a contract with any man for the
supply of his labor should be put upon worse
terms or regarded as any less binding. And
a Labor Government should be the last in
the world to treat it in that way.

can’t they settle down and be contented':”
asks the Australian who, nationally, has
never had cause for discontent. "They’re
more prosperous now than they ever were
before.” Ireland is prosperous, certainly,
vet not so prosperous as it might be. And
the Irish know it. Apart from the nation’s
self-respecting desire to possess its own
soul, it wants a number of material benefits
which only self-government will bring.
I‘rimarily, it wants the curse of Protection.
It is curious to scan Irish history and observe
how, all through the centuries, the country
has been the victim of self-seeking English
merchants and manufacturers. After
< 'komwell’s army left, Irish'agriculture and
Irish manufactures began to look up to such
purpose that half-way through Ciiaki.es ll.’s
reign the English Parliament stepped in.
The importation to England of Irish farm-
produce of all descriptions was prohibited,
and a heavy tariff was raised against Irish-
made goods. The result was unexpected.
France took all the cattle and corn that Ire-
land had to spare, and a flourishing woollen
industry sprang into existence. For some
years prior to the Act of Union Ireland had
enjoyed a Protective schedule almost as
drastic as Australia’s new tariff. A pros-
perous cotton-manufacturing industry grew
up, amongst other concerns. Put il was not
established so strongly as the Lancashire in-
dustry, and Freetrade within the United
Kingdom killed it. At the present time
Ireland is importing annually £10,000,000
worth of cotton goods which Irishmen have
proved their ability to manufacture, and in
the production of which the country has
distinct geographical advantages. Before
ihe war Britain took 415.000 cotton-bales of
5001 b. from America yearly. Much of it
might have gone to Belfast, but practically
all of it went on to Liverpool. Belfast was
robbed thereby of the tremendous volume of
trade associated with the terminal port of
the great trans-Atlantic steamship line's.
The total loss to all Ireland, in hard cash,
is incalculable in this connection alone; and
the case is only one of scores. It has been
estimated that the harnessing of four rivers
-the Corrib, the Shannon, the Erne and the
Uann—will alone produce 100,000 h.p.v
equal to a saving of 700,000 tons of coal
yearly. The Irish in the South, as well
as the North, have demonstrated that., given
decent wages, they are equal to the best as
industrialists. The Yankee Ford Co., wh'eh
established a big factory there during the
war, has stated that “Irish labor compares
favorably with Amei’ean labor and is more
readily available.” Fine harbors, which are
nearer to the great export markets Mian those
of England, are clamoring to be developed.
But meanwhile Ireland is waiting for the
necessary stimulus —the sort of stimulus that
an Irish Parliament was allowed for a href
period to give to Irish industries in the
1 Sth century. Is it remarkable in the cir-
cumstances that Irishmen of ail classes
should be reaching out desperately after the
tremendous destiny which they see ahead of
their country? The Great War operated to
show the Irish a splendid vision—that of a
rich and self-supporting Ireland under no
necessity to be beholden to anyone; and
those who have seen it would be a mean lot
if they did not struggle hard to bring it to
materialisation.
Tiie northern side of the Murray, from
Moama or thereabouts to the South Austra-
lian border, is a standing example of the
blighting influence that one overwhelming
city has upon a State. This area hasn’t any
railways because it is too far from Sydney
to put in lines to drag things thither, and
X. S. Wales has consistently refused to allow
any of the Vic. lines which tap the Murray
at Koondrook, Swan Hill, Piangil and Mil-
dura to be extended across because they
would take traffic to Victoria. There aren’t
even any bridges across the river below
Swan Hill till you come to Murray Bridge
(S.A.), and traffic goes across in divers
ancient punts, some of them worked by
hand. Consequently there are only a few
stray patches of irrigation on the N. S.
Wales side, most of the country along the
river being a desert after 12 months’ drought,
whereas thousands of irrigation farmers and
orchardists on the Vic. side on land no better
and sometimes not as good are reaping a
harvest as a result of the very same drought.
There is going to be something of a waking-
lip, though, when the Murray is locked. For
even if N. S. Wales won’t allow any railways
to cross the border, the locking of the river
to ensure continuous navigation will mean
that country within reach of the Murray and
of the lower Murrumbidgee and Wakool will
be able to get its stuff away by boat to the
railheads on the Vic. side.

“Rio”: Minister for Defence Pearce
denies knowledge of any favoritism to
Queenslanders, yet the fact remains that, now
that General Legge has gone, every soldier-
member of the Military Board is a Banana-
lander. and of the nine senior officers from
that State eight (Ghatjvkl. White. Segl-
heim, Forsyth, Dodds. Foott. Brand and
Dowse) hold comfortable lI.Q. billets, all
in Melbourne, while the ninth is Command-
ant of Tasmania. One never sees an officer
from Queensland filling one of the ordinary-
ruck instructional appointments. Toe
writer has served with or under most of
those mentioned above, and. except that a
few have become narrowed by too much
office work, has the highest opinion of their
ability; hut that is not to say that there
are not men from other States equally quali-
fied, «nd if so it is bad nolicy to let lI.Q.
appointments be monopolised by Queens-
landers, who naturally prefer their old
State comrades and give officers from other
States the idea that a fair deal is impos-
sible under the present regime. I’ve heard
many officers say, “We will never get a
fair deal until we get an A.G. who is not
a Queenslander.” While not going that far,
I think Sellheim has been too long in his
present post, and that the renewal of his
appointment was a mistake. Any man, no
matter how able and progressive, when in
a bureaucratic and autocratic position tends
to become conservative, to prefer old col-
leagues to new ones, and to resent innova-
tions. The Australian IRQ. is undoubtedly
the most conservative in the Empire. It is
run by the same Minister and officers and in
the same way as before the war, with the
THE PUNTER.
“At the opening of the N.S.W. Parliament a furious attack, led by Mr. Fitzpatrick, the late
Treasurer, was made on Daniel Levy for accepting the Speakership and thus enabling the new Labor
Government to carry on.”

I want is my money hack!”
same old red tape and circumlocution. It
has scores of able young officers full of new
ideas, but they get no chance to try them.

A pamphlet by Captain Rhodes, harbor-
master at Rockhampton, and formerly at
Townsville, puts forward a plea for the
establishment of a small wireless station on
the Willis Group. At present, when a
cyclone is imminent, barometrical readings
from the North Queensland coast are tele-
graphed to Melbourne, where somebody tries
to foretell on insufficient data whether there
is going to be a disturbance or not. Having
carefully made up his mind that there will
be one, he tries to wire the warning to the
Northern towns, only to find that the “im-
pending” cyclone has arrived and cheerfully
cut all telegraph connections. Just as the
monks at Manila can and do warn those in
peril by land and sea at Hong Kong and on
the Chinese Coast, so could an observer at
the Willis Group warn the people of Banana-
land and the shipping along the coast. Rep-
resentations have been made time and again
to the Federal authorities to try to obtain
some system whereby fair warning of these
storms could be given : but neither the de-
struction that has taken place at Cairns,
Innisfail, Townsville and Mackay, nor the
loss of the Yongala, Llewellyn and other
vessels will move those in power to spend a
small sum of money on this wireless outpost.
Rhodes, a seaman who knows his business,
has been indefatigable in endeavoring to
obtain this concession, which would mean the
lessening of the risk of human lives. And
the less that risk the greater the chance of
populating those Northern waste spaces.
This generation doesn’t remember the
Gothenburg; yet unquestionably it was the
loss of that vessel on the Barrier Reef,
coming back with a Judge and other poten-
tates from a circuit court at Darwin, which,
as it were, cut the connection between
Adelaide and its Far North, and led to the
gradual decay of the Territory.
Following up a suggestion made in The
Bulletin last November, Mayor Rowe, of
Clunes (Vic.), called a conference of muni-
cipal men to discuss decentralisation. The
success of the Clunes knitting mills in keep-
ing 100 young people, mostly maidens, at
home and at work was the chief text. At
least half a dozen ready-made towns between
Ballarat and Maryborough are already
decadent from lack of work. But instead
of guaranteeing £IOOO to establish a tailor-
ing factory or a shirt factory or a boot
factory on a small scale for a start, the dele-
gates began by talking about how to
approach the Government for a subsidy on
the £-for-£ basis to establish some unnamed
industry. The same old rut or groove or
drain was to be widened into a river of
Pactolus to bring in public money ! Not a
single new \ctea was announced, thouglb
there was plenty of caterwauling as to way
the Government didn’t do something to stop
these old towns crumbling away. One
bank has, or lately had, nearly £IOO,OOO
of deposits for local people in a town near
Clunes. But instead of drawing on that
fund to establish a small jam factory, or
a pickled-onion brinery, or a place to make
a hundred thousand pairs of socks a year,
there was this everlasting attempt to loaf
on the Treasury—which is to say, the tax-
payer.
“Mum”: “Dad” (B. 15/4/’2O) has my
sympathy in his discovery that his deceitful
country doesn't really wants babies. I once
travelled round the coast with four small
kiddies on an overseas steamer. First thing
I was informed very curtly that I must not
use the bathroom for the children except dur-
ing one specified hour a day—a most awk-
ward hour, too. This may have been
necessary, but the general air of disapproval
was unnecessary. One old lady passenger
summed up the feeling in the remark : “People
have no righ t to have all those children; if
they have them,-the}- should be made to suffer
for it.” And they are! I have seen a tram-
conductor throw a handful of change on the
roadway to a mother who didn’t get her brood
oil' quickly enough to please him. And many
times have I heard it said of mothers in pub-
lic places : “A woman with all those kids ought
to stay at home!” As for Baby Welfare. I
never had much sympathy with it. Instead of
preaching hygiene I would say to any aspiring
Welfare worker: “What about going round
to the nearest busy working mother and tak-
ing charge of the little ones on washing-day.
or giving an evening up to help with the iron-
ing?” There would be no newspaper glory m
this. I know, but it would be real patriotism,
and perhaps Heaven would take notice. P.S.
—I’ve got six.
Does this extract from the 15)13 report
of Nicholas Iloltze, the then Government
botanist of the N.T.,*'interest anyone now?—
The three most important fibre plants of India
are indigenous to the Territory, viz., jute, Sunn
hemp and Deccan hemp. In Bengal alone over
2,000,000 acres are annually planted with jute.
And in Australia the unfortunate wheat-
cocky has been paying as much as 17d. for
a three-bushel bag to put his wretched har-
vest into—over four times more than lie
paid before the foreign profiteer found out
what easy prey he is.
Headed by State Gov. Davidson, divers
speakers at the recent annual meeting of
the Alexandra Children’s Hospital were en-
thusiastic for “charity” as against State up-
keep of such institutions. Apparently this
item in the annual report didn’t depress the
oratory a bit:—
The number of children treated during the year
was 24,827 —in-patients 3135, out-patients 21,692.
Children to the number of 175 were on the waiting
list for operation. Additions to the hospital were
badly needed, the 230 cots being inadequate to meet
requirements. On this account children bad to be
turned away.
That is what dependence on blessed Charity
is always liable to mean. What would his
Excellency say if it were proposed to make
the maintenance of Government House simi-
larly dependent?
This appeal reaches The Bulletin from
Perth :—
I am an old-age pensioner now in hospital.
I’ecently another pensioner died here, and, will you
believe it, his mates had to send round the hat to
procure the necessary amount for putting him under-
ground ! I am dreading something similar. Can-
not you lend your aid to get a death allowance, say
£20? We are all poor of the poorest. The de-
ceased’s relatives or nearest friend could give up
his pension-card and a certificate from a doctor as
a title to the funeral money. Help us, please, do!
“T.P.”: What’s to become of our trades?
The other day a country saddler approached
my academy with a request for a boy to learn
the trade. I tramped the town and argued
my throat sore with parents. Result, nil.
I returned to the saddler, who then produced
the 1 !)10 log—boy to start on 10s. weekly,
with annual rises. That revived my hopes
of getting an annrentice for him, and I set
out again. At last 1 picked up a boy, dilapi-
dated and barefooted, but a good lad. I ran
him into the saddler, and between us we
enthused the kiddie. T marched him home
to mother. “Pooh!” said she. “only 10s.
to start and £4 10s. the maxim after seven
year! ’E can do better nor that now at
rabbit trappin’!” May I. without hurting
the tender susceptibilities of loyalists, men-
tion Germany? I lately had a yarn with a
jockey who, before the war. rode horses for
the Kaiser. (By the way. he said that Bill
was a gent, and paid, win or lose. The
Crown Prince was a larrikin, who paid
nothing, considering it sufficient honor for
an Australian to be allowed to ride a Crown
Prince’s mokes.) Well, the jockey told me
that the Germans required each lad to do
something, learn something, and stick at it.
and the thing lie noticed was the crowd of
highly-trained tradesmen. Frank Tate. Vie.
Director of Education, told the same story
of his visit, and impressed me. But the
fact of the Australian jockey noticing it im-
pressed me even more.
From a Vic. State Gallery-man:—
It now seems likely that the elections will happen
somewhere about the end of August or the begin-
ning of September, and Lawson will have to recon-
struct or be slain. He is now rather keeen on a
rapprochement with Peacock, but Alexander won't
be induced to smile on the wistful leader except on
terms harrowing to the other’s dignity. Any bond
between them must be made at the sacrifice of the
present Cabinet, and Lawson hates to pay that
price for an alliance, though he must realise that
four of his team at least —Hutchinson, Campbell,
Pennington and Oman —are very close to the rocks.
Lawson’s followers in Gipp.sland and the metropolis
are fairly confident of return. The Farmers, who
now include Carlisle and Bowser, M’s.L.A., count
on capturing from 12 to 15 seats, and it is possible
that the important post of leader will be handed to
Bowser, whose long experience and rigid adherence
to the Cocky religion are bound to take the eye of
the novices wiio will reach the House. The Cockies
will work solidly against Lawson, particularly in
the mattter of 6 o’clock closing and Scripture read-
ing (if revived), whilst Fat and the Melbourne Club
promise opposition if he tries a super-income tax to
give a needed lift to his waning revenue. Lawson
and all good democrats are in favor of the measure,
but the Premier would probably have no better luck
than Peacock, whose Super-Income Tax Bill was
thrown out by the House of Stunimick two or three
years ago after a hurried meeting at the Melbourne
Club. Frank Clarke, now of the Lawson Ministry,
is, by the way, suspected of having played a big
part in that tumultuous rejection.


A strong, virile nation needs strong, virile
tasks on which to bend its energies. The
Iron and Steel Industry opens up such a
held of endeavor for Australian Manhood,
providing work that develops and fosters
self-control, initiative, stamina and force
of character.
The Australian
Iron and Steel
Industry
would give employment at Australian'rates of pay (if
all the Iron and Steel goods imported into Australia
were made by our own people) to not less than
30,000 MEN,
wHo would earn over
£5»000,000 per year.
POLITICAL
POINTS
From the Federal Gallery :
Further chjang'es are forecasted in the Federal
Cabinet. Joe Cook, who isn't getting younger or
more active, is expected to be peacefully buried in
Andy Fisher's billet towards the end of the year.
Fleming, chairman of the new khaki committee
among the Nationalists, is in the running for the
vacancy, though Lamond is pouring butter on Hughes
and it may bring him a reward. Pratten talks of
resign!ng from the Senate and standing for Cook’s
seat, and Milieu is also thinking of pulling out and
seeking a larger sphere in the Reps. Hughes is not
so enamored of his own billet now that Canada has
started a precedent for the Dominions by having her
own ambassador at Washington. Both for the salary
and the glory Hughes wouldn’t be averse to spruiking
for Australia in the lee of the White House. Watt
would of counse succeed him here. There may be
times when he thinks he ought to in any case.
Heartened by the success of the Farmers
at the recent Federal and N.‘ S. Wales elec-
tions the Queensland Primary Producers’
Union has disc\vned the patronage of the
Nationalists and is going forward on its own.
But these subdivisions to be of any real value
ought to he accompanied by something else—
Elective Ministries; or, better still, the ap-
pointment of Ministers from the most suit-
able men in all the country. To break Parlia-
ment up into half a dozen parties, and limit
the selection of Ministers to one of them, will
simply give ns poorer Governments than ever.
Vic. Parliament got mislaid for a week
towards the end of last month and nobody
missed it. It. was prorogued till April 20.
April 20 passed and nothing was done ; and
not till seven days later was it recovered
from Limbo, none the worse, and sent into
recess again, this time till May 25. Until
Irvine’s proclamation, countersigned by
Lawson, demonstrated the contrary, old-
fashioned constitutionalists hugged the idea
that an Australian State legislature, after
it has been sworn in. must be either in ses-
sion or in recess. But plainly it can be
merely in suspension.
J. E. Ogden, leader of the Speck’s Par-
liamentary Labor party, says there are no
cheap-labor countries now, in the old sense,
and he reckons that if Australia wants more
Protection than is already provided by the
Shipping Ring it must be devoid of brains
and energy. Apart from the fact that the
man who says there are no cheap-labor
countries forgets more than half the people
of the world and talks rubbish, there are
countries where industries have been so
organised that they can squash any infant.
If Ogden wants an example of that he has
only to consider the question of electric-
power supply in his own small island. A
few years ago it cost Hobart £lO for as much
power as can already be had for £3 55., and
when the other hike scheme is completed the
Government has contracted to supply it for
£2 ss. But if Tasmania had waited to get
electric power until it could have it at
£2 os., it probably would never have had
power at all, any more than Ogden would
ever have been able to run if iris mother
had forbidden him to crawl.
Any insurance office would demand a
cruel premium to insure Danny Deyy’s poli-
tical life. The part of Sydney which he
has represented for years is strongly anti-
Labor; anyhow, the section which has put
him in is. It is furious at his acceptance
of the Speakership. On the other hand,
Labor has no use for one of his type. The
Storey Government will not last long. It is
likely, for tactical reasons, to commit sui-
cide presently, in order to go after a solid
mandate before its supporters shall have
realised its impotence to do very much for
them. When that time arrives Daniel is
liable to crash heavily, arid if he ever rises
again, politically, it will be contrary to all
precedent.
A Westralian M.H.R. has asked in the
House whether it wasn’t McKay, the har-
vester maker, who asked the Government to
put a Protective duty on harvesters; also
whether it wasn’t the B. H. Prop, which
asked for a duty on steel. And, apparently,
the Westralian M.H.R. was prepared to be
horrified when he was told that the dreadful
rumor he had heard was true. Probably
this M.H.R. expected McKay to be interested
in getting a duty on silkworms and the B. H.
Prop, to have its mind set upon measures
for the encouragement of the parrot-food
industry. Also presumably the Westralian
M.H.R. is prepared to be horrified if a
man takes his own boots to be repaired, it
being a sign of corruption or something when
a man is concerned about the only boots he
really knows anything about.
Victoria joins the procession of decentral-
isers with a Country Towns Movement as a
protest against Melbourne’s habit of grabbing-
all the industries save agriculture-—which
can’t be crowded into Flinders-lane —and alt
THE EUROPEAN CIRCUS.
THE RINGMASTER : "Come on! Go through,
or—the whip!”
Ihe new population and a lot of the old.
The big city holds more than half the popula-
tion. and people are decreasing everywhere
except in it and its environs. But unless a
great part of the State breaks away and
establishes a new deep-water port and an in-
land capital, so that the traders at the port
of the new State won’t bite the legislative
ear day and night, the movement will prob-
ably run its course and die out. The octo-
pus will be polite and sympathetic, but he
will go on feeding. Nobody ever reformed
an octopus.
The stereotyped person who welcomed the
Governor-General at Glen Innes with the
banal suggestion that the new State should
be called New Scotland to match New- South
Wales reminds this paper of the old bush
shanty-keeper who called every one of his
big mob of dogs Towser. When Tue Bul-
letin drew his attention to it, “Yairs,” he
drawled —“can’t be bothered thinkin’ up
names for dorgs.”
According to daily-paper reports public
opinion in Maoriland “strongly disapproves”
of the railwayman’s strike, which some
humorist timed so that 16,000 people were
held up at Rotorua, where they had gone to
help Bella Papakura show 7 the Prince the
blowholes. Such things aren’t worth cabling.
Public opinion in England overwhelmingly
disapproved of the Norman Conquest, and
there are countless similar examples. Pub-
lic opinion, unless it is organised and has a
gun or some other form of forcible expres-
sion, is the whale voting against the sword-
fish by a big majority.
After looking at the list of “honors” which
the Holman Government recommended in its*
last moments many people will be glad that
those moments were its last. Still the new
men needn’t have made such a fuss about
the proposed, baronetcy for -George Fuller
' (which recommendation they promptly can-
celled) because it was hereditary. During
the long spell of Labor Government which
began in 1910, the distribution of the honor
of Hereditary Bondholder amounted to a
scandal.
Senator Gardiner declared passionately
that the anti-anarchist clauses in the Immi-
gration Bill would have shut out George
Washington. Why Gardiner should worry
about Washington—an officer of George
lll.’s service, a great landowner, a slave-
owner, an aristocrat of the old Virginian
type, and possessed of a wife who required
her servants to serve her on their knees—the
Lord only knows. Probably Bruce Smith
would welcome him, but Gardiner himself
would ring the firebell at the Trades ‘Hall
if he saw such a man in the offing.
Perdriau, M.L.A. for Byron, proposes to
demand a referendum rc the formation of
a new State in Northern N. S. Wales. The
movement should be supported (1) by the
Northern members themselves; (2) by all
advocates of decentralisation; (3) by all
members whose Irish descent has more or
less committed them to the principle of self-
determination. (Out of the 45 Government
members this should ensure the votes of
Doyle, Murphy, T. M. Burke. M. Burke.
Minahan, O’Halloran. McTlernan, Kearsley,
Dooley, McGirr, Loughlin. Fitzgerald.
O’Brien, Scully, O’Hearne, Flannery, Swiney.
Cleary, Buckley, and possibly Dunn, Mclvell
and Connell. There are also Fegan and
Fitzpatrick on the other side.) Add to
these three classes all the advocates of the
Keferendum principle, and Perdriau should
get about 245 votes in a House of 90.
“Tripok”: Freetrade Argus of April 21
complained that : ‘the tariff of the Common-
wealth is already one of the highest in the
world.” Well, the cost of living is cheaper
here than in any other “white” part of the
globe, so what’s wrong about it?
Australia, with the problem of maintaining
an efficient navy ahead of it, is faced with
some figures which are not designed to
increase its happiness. The Hood, Britain’s
latest naval monster, cost £5,287,325; while
the Hawkins, a light cruiser, ran to
£1,570.000 —the price of a first-class battle-
ship only a few years before the war. A
similar cruiser, the Kent, which took part in
the Falkland battle, though built only 18
years ago for £700,283, is already for sale
as scrap-iron. And the rate at which battle
vessels become obsolete is on the increase.
It is a mad world.
From the Vic. State lobby:—
The Prohibition and Scripture referendumites,
believing themselves to be the top dogs, contemplate
having a field-time next session, so as to get an
election black-list ready. But they won’t have it all
their own way. If Lawson gives them too many
facilities, the Ministry’s own applecart will be
upset and a general election will occur much earlier
than November. Labor and Henry Hayseed are both
organising, and Liberal “consolidation” and a “re-
vision” of the Ministry are suggested as safeguards
in the triangular conflict on polling-day. Single-
seated constituencies with preferential voting (as at
present) finds favor with parties other than Labor.
Labor, getting a hint from X. S. Wales, wants
three-seat electorates with proportional voting.
“Cicada”: There is more trouble brewing
for the Australian cocky who sticks to whear
and relies upon a market 1 2,001) miles away.
Down to 1910 Brazil imported wheat every
year. Then it .started to grow more and
more of the grain, and last year it exported
over a million dollars’ worth.
The Bulletin’s position as regards de-
centralisation is that it admires Sydney very
much and wants to cut (say) three new
States out of N. S. Wales so that they may
start growing three more Sydneys—one
apiece. Almost every other paper seems to
regard Sydney as a horror which shouldn’t
be duplicated.
Ma State’s new Labor Government has
much the same job on hand as Wade left
to the original McGowen lot —to decide
whether a man sentenced to death shall
be hanged. Until Holman was pushed out of
the. Labor party the hangman was given a
holiday, and the new Labor Government is
pledged to abolish capital punishment.
. The sentence on ex-l’remier Caillaux of
France, convicted of correspondence with
the enemy, includes loss of his vote and
his right to sit in Parliament for 10 years.
In most countries which have Parliaments
that is a frequent tag to a sentence, and
sometimes it is practically the whole sen-
tence. In Australia, when the 12 I.W.W.
criminals get out, they can all make a
sprint for legislative billets with a view
to taking vengeance on society by making
laws for it.
Not many returned soldiers are going U>
quarrel with ex-Digger Gann’s decision that
married men are not to be displaced from
N. S. Wales public jobs to provide work for
returned single men; it is the continued em-
ployment of eligible single men who failed
to hear the call, whilst men who did hear
it are out of work, that enrages the Digger.
The new policy, if it is honestly followed,
is, at any rate, a straighter one than Hol-
man’s. He promised an absolute preference,
but was prepared to make so many excep-
tions that it was a case, as usual, of run-
ning with the hare and hunting with tin;
hounds.
The Shipping Ring has a good stranglehold
on Tasmania. A Hobart merchant recently
asked his London agent to send some goods
by a Commonwealth steamer which was to
touch at Hobart. The reply was that it
wasn’t safe, as these steamers were not in
the “Associated Conference,” and if the firm
made even one shipment by them the “Con-
ference” lines would decline to carry any
cargo for it in future. And. instead of
spending our millions in manufactures, etc.,
to make ourselves independent of this
monopoly, we spend them in putting men
into an industry in which they will be abso-
lutely dependent upon it to reach their
market! No wonder the shipping interest
grows almost omnipotent, with such fools to
fatten on.
"P.X.” : Ashford, who would probably have
a four-fifths majority as Lands Minister if
the N. 8. Wales Assembly elected Ministers
on what members honestly believe to be their
merits for the job, parted with the Forestry
branch with the most regret. Though least
talked about, it has made most progress dur-
ing the past few years, and there are now
half-a-million acres of reserve undergoing
actual tree-cultivation. Two men have it
in hand —Hay, who, though not a techni-
cally-trained man, is an organiser; and
Jolly, a Rhodes scholar, who specialised in
forestry. At the same time as forests are
growing men are being educated in forestry,
a school having been opened near Gosford.
There are only half-a-dozen students at
present, but they are picked men who have
first had to do six months’ hard field work ;
and they are a superfine lot. There is a
tremendous amount to do yet; but no State
has made a start on better lines and with
more settled plans.
Those who buy screening-cloths and
weaves “made in Australia” only get im-
ported wires which are made up here. Some
sorts of wire are imported in large sizes and
drawn down to a few standard gauges; but
the local wire-drawer and wire-worker have,
to pay the foreign manufacturer the price
he demands for his product, plus an appalling-
variety of other charges. The Australian
wire-worker hungers for a locally-made selec-
tion and can’t get them, because a plant
capable of turning out the big assortment of
sizes used would cost a quarter-million—and
that’s a lot of money to spend on a local
plant without a permanent guarantee that it
won’t have to be dismantled presently through
foreign competition. Australia has all the
raw materials for this work, with a big-
market for the finished products, and the
quarter-million could be raised in a day
under the right conditions. But the quarter-
millionaire is a shy bird when there are so
many anti-tariff sports waiting to blow his
head off. Wherefore, let us have a bit of
sense and declare an all-the-year close-season
for quarter-millionaires of the enterprising-
kind and permit them to build their nests
in peace. The all-Australian hen-coops and
sieves and wire-doors that will be hatched as
a result will pay handsomely for the protec-
tion given.

—Typical political item.
They are rooting in the ruins of the Party which is
dead,
And dragging ancient corpses to the light.
See that old and tattered Scandal with the cobwebs
on its head —
A profitless and melancholy sight.
They intend to use it freely: you’ll appreciate the
lurk
On recalling that a Scandal is a substitute for Work.
Xow they’re digging up the titles, which are dead
like all the rest:
In fact, the dashed things never came to life.
That pathetic still-born Honors List, in mildewed
cere-cloths drest,
Will figure iir the forefront of the strife.
The advantage of such objects is they criticism foil:
Thus enabling those who used them to escape from
sordid toil.
It is simpler far to rummage the unalterable past
For broken pledges, sins and lies gone by,
Than to carry out a policy impracticably vast.
The Party statesman winks the other eye
When lie’s asked to start reforming: lie prefers
instead to show
The horrors that were threatened by the men of
long ago.

Everything has apparently gone this co.’s
way during the past couple of years. Like
other traders, owing partly to the plethora
or paper issued by the Federal Treasury and
partly to the savings of tens of thousands of
men who for a time were not in a position
to spend all the Defence Department paid
them, the property salesman has had a very
w r ide circle of competing buyers. This co.
however, does not itself buy or sell anything;
it is merely a holding concern, owning every
.share in Arthur Rickard and Co. and
practically all the shares in the old Hay-
market Co., the rest of its assets consisting
of advances to the Arthur Rickard Co. and
£lO,lOO in War Loan. As a rule, the ac-
counts of a holding concern are of little
value, for very seldom are the figures of the
subsidiary offices brought into the light. This
extended co. takes the unusual and highly
commendable course of publishing the Arthur
Rickard and llaymarket accounts along
with its own.
The former subsidiary, which drops every
penny of its visible earnings into the
parent's pockets (except that it holds £lO,OOO
of reserves in case of accident;, had a very
successful year. Though it was hit to the
extent of £13,000 by Federal Land Tax for
adjustments going back eight years, a net
profit of £21,140 showed up. compared with
£14,996 for 1918 and £12,971 for 1917. The
Haymarket Co., which had to undergo con-
siderable cleansing after it was taken over —
writing down of assets to the extent of
about £30,000 was found necessary—has also
been doing better, showing a £6Oll net pro-
fit for the 12 months, which compares with
previous years’ net earnings: 1918, £4075;
1917, £2020; 1916, £136. As a result, it lifted
its div. a point to 5 p.c., giving the holding
concern a little over a thousand more, and
then leaving in hand more than a thousand of
undivided profits for the year. Of this co.’s
affairs the directors now state rhat “assets
have been very conservatively valued and
ample provision has been made for all
possible contingencies”—which is more than
mere mortal man is entitled to say. It was
formerly burdened with a number of city
properties which were not earning their keep,
but practically all these have been unloaded.
The realisations have, of course, freed funds
for more profitable investment, and since
interest rates have also improved its earning
possibilities are much improved—that is, so
long as favorable conditions continue. The
two big items among its assets are: Buyers’
balances, £133.900; and unsold land and
property, £40,176. Since paid capital is
only £lOO,OOO, liabilities are heavy—£76,346.
Besides being a dealer in land the Arthur
Rickard co. is itself to some extent a hold-
ing concern; it owns £82,856 of other cos.’
debentures and has a £71,902 share interest
in “other cos. and joint enterprises.” The
former is a new item, and precisely what is
the nature of the debentures is not stated.
Of the shares, it is known that the co. holds
all the ordinary issue (£5000) in the Hotel
Sydney (Central Railway Palace Buildings,
Ltd.), which is beginning to blossom, and has
also an interest in the N.S.W.. Realty Co.
What is clear is that, besides its own Dig
slices of land, it has substantial interests in
other land-holding concerns. The principal
feature of recent balance-sheets of the two
subsidiary cos. in the Arthur Rickard Ex-
tended stable is the way in which external
liabilities have been reduced: in five years
the Arthur Rickard Co. has effected an im-
provement of over £120,000 in this way.
During the past year the parent co. got
in a further £24,161 of 71 p.c. cum. pref.
capital, making the amount paid up as at
Dec. 31 last £300,000. Combining the figures
of the three balance-sheets shows what there
is to represent this capital:—

.. ..£259,714
Haymarket interests not held
(approx.) iJL 200,904
Net assets .. •• •• ..£336,086
The £300.000 paid capital is made up of an
equal number of prefs. and ordinaries, and
after making allowance for a return of the
former capital and also deducting the current
dividends, there were net assets with a book
value of about 245. 3d. to represent each xL
of ordinary capital. Whether they will
eventually prove to be worth 245. 3d. is a
matter which the investor must decide for
himself. Conditions lately have been such
that undreamt-of prices have been obtained
—one estate, within a stone’s-tlirow of where
the Wild Cat puts in its spare time separating
the roses and the blackberries on the heights
of Northern Sydney, realised over £26,000 the
other day, yet a syndicate only a couple of
years ago had it under offer for £lO,OOO and
turned it down hard. Also conditions have
probably been better than they ever were for
getting in purchasers’ balances, but an
amount in excess of paid capital outstanding
in this way in difficult times is not a pleasant
prospect, particularly if some of the co.’s own
creditors got panicky and were in a position
to demand their money. The shareholders in
cos. of this kind are mostly backing their
faith in the future.

The Union is the only trustee co. which has
established itself in more than one State. It
started in Melbourne 35 years ago, and
shortly afterwards opened in Brisbane. A
Sydney branch, with a heavy-weight local
Board to coax in business, was established
five years ago. What spoils have been won
as a result of this raid into N.S.W. territory
are not evident from the published accounts,
for the Union has always kept the extent of
its trusts a dark secret. So the only clue to
the co.’s expansion is to be got from noting
the growth of its earnings. And this isn’t a
clue that is easy to follow, for not only has
more capital been put to work during recent
years, but, like all traders, the trustee man-
ager lias lately been handling goods which
have appreciated in value and have also been
earning more while in his care, thus giving
him larger commissions. Here is a com-
parison of the Union’s earnings and outgoings
over many years :
Commissions,
Interest, etc. Expenses.

1920 . . . • 37,029 24,609
Paid capital in 1915 was £73,822; it has
since been increased to £lOO,OOO. Also during
the past year the management had about
£12.000 more stored-up profits to work for it
than five years ago. With these additional
funds, the assistance of the new Sydney
branch and abnormal conditions, income has
been more than doubled, and net profits now
represent a return of over p.c. on present
total funds compared with under 8| p.c. in
1915. The management admits that a record
lot of business has been captured during the
past few years, but, like most big trustee
cos., this one gives its figures “exclusive of
commissions not wholly earned.”
Though the Union gives no hint of the ex-
tent of the estates it administers, it is fairly
clear that it ranks about third in importance
among Australian trustee cos.—The Per-
petual. of Sydney, and the T. E. and A., of
Melbourne, being the only others with larger
figures. To protect its clients from loss
through misappropriation or bungling, share-
holders have put up £lOO,OOO. Nominal capi-
tal is a quarter-million in £2 10s. shares, and
of this £1 is paid up, £1 is a reserve liability
(for the protection of clients), and there is
10s. per share still callable for ordinary pur-
poses. Besides, over £29,000 of visible re-
serves have been accumulated by restricting
dividends in the past. After payment of
latest dividends the co. thus had over
£120,000 immediately available and £150.000
within call if anything serious should happen.
There never was a private trustee who
voluntarily put up such a guarantee to
be of good behavior and faithfully carry out
instructions. The expansion of the Union’s
own investments is shown next: —

Premises are thus the largest item among the
assets, for the co. owns its own properties in
each of the three cities in which it is doing
business. For the first time in its career a
little capitalising of reserves is now taking
place, a special div. of Is. per share being
declared to meet a call for a similar amount.

Though this co. has about £7OOO more ac-
cumulated profits to put to work than it had
prior to the war its advances are about £3OOO
smaller than they used to be. Instead of
having practically the whole of its paid capi-
tal and reserves, deposits and other borrowed
money out on loan, the management, after
curtailing its liabilities by about £11,600,
now holds £6OOO in public securities. But
from the smaller volume of advances the co.
is, on account of higher interest rates, earn-
ing about £5OO more than it used to, and net
profits are better than they ever were. Like
all building societies that ran into heavy
weather in the ’nineties, this one has had a
Very eventful career. In 1000 assets were
revalued and capital written down. Fore-
closures were given a book value of about
£72,000, but things have so brightened since
that all but £3711 has been successfully un-
loaded, and realisations have brought in about
£18,700 in excess of the written-down values.
As these old properties were worked off the
co. acquired funds available for making new
advances. Consequently there have been
these changes since the clean-up:—

At the latest balance depositors had £31.452
in the business. Deducting the, bank over-
draft of £2433 there were assets with a book
value of about £126,500 to protect them, or
over £4 of advances, etc., to meet every £1
of deposits.

That is the best profit that has been dis-
closed for five years, so the div. is elevated
to 10 p.c. again. But note that reserves now
shown are below what they used to be; in
other words, according to the accounts the
divs. paid during recent years have not
been wholly earned. But what the directors
claim was earned and actual net profits made
may be quite different matters. This co. is
working the Greta seam at Maitland, and
the N. S. Wales Royal Commission which
inquired into the increased prices fixed by
the Federal Government not only declared
that these Maitland cos. were much better
placed than other collieries, but that the
increased prices granted more than made
good the additional costs incurred by labor
demands. So far as the Wickham and
Bullock Island is concerned, the table does
not bear out this allegation. But the eo.
has Deen in a different position from most
others, for it has been busy developing two
new properties, the Cessnock and Kalingo,
and it is pretty clear that all the outlay
necessary to acquire and open up these mines
has not been provided from capital account.
Both of the new properties have been brought
under the wing since 1 916, since when no
new capital has been got in. Meantime this
change has been effected in the co.'s liquid
position:—
Mar., ’l6. Mar., ’2O.
Liquid assets .. .. .. £40,797 £07,334
Liabilities (inc. divs.) .. 8,515 13,35.)
Surplus £31.982 £53,979
Despite the acquisition and development of
the two new properties the book value of
all fixed assets has during the four years
decreased from £85,590 to £69,615. Assume
that no interests outside the old Neath had
been acquired during the period, then besides
paying an average of over S-t p.e. p.a. in divs.
the management has also built up a liquid
surplus of over £16,220 to make good wasting
assets, and has also set aside a further £5777
in an accident insurance reserve. That
would not be bad going for so abnormal a
period. But, actually, in addition to this
performance the co. has bought the Cessnock
and Kalingo, brought the former into pro-
duction —“the output is being gradually _ in-
creased,” say the directors —and is rapidly
getting the latter to the coal-hauling stage.
It is thus very obvious that, the Wickham
and Bullock Island has done considerably
better than its published accounts claim : how
much better only those inside, who know
how much has been spent on the Cessnock
and Kalingo and what was a fair allow-
ance for depreciation of old assets, have any
idea. What is clear is that, whereas the
co. has in the past been able to make one
mine pay handsomely, it will before long have
three producers. If all goes well, the co.’s
shareholders are thus on a very sweet thing,
and some day the management may find it
necessary to discover what relation capital
has to the actual value of assets. Still,
the future may have its disappointments for
some of the colliery cos. Not only has cer-
tain overseas trade been lost by disturbances
and high prices resulting from the miners’
jamborees, but the conversion of many of
the big liners to burn oil instead of coal is
going to knock holes in the bunkering trade.
On the other hand, the Commonwealth is
only just beginning its manufacturing career,
and demands for coal for home consumption
must steadily improve; but that is precisely
the trade that in the new order of things is
most liable to have its profits limited.

Within the last week or two Common-
wealth and State (N.S.W.) Income Tax
Commissioners have had appeals made
against their assessments, and in both cases
their counsel have admitted that they
couldn’t argue the point.. The Common-
wealth sought to tax tote investments, on
the ground that the tote is a lottery. After
counsel for the Commissioner had admitted
that he could not profitably add anything, to
what the other side had said, the High
Court unanimously, and almost scornfully,
brushed the proposed tax aside. In the State
case Dr. Brissenden, for the Commissioner,
had to show why damages paid for a libel
should be taxable; and he admitted that
he couldn’t. This is not treating the tax-
paying community fairly. It should not be
necessary for a taxpayer to go to the
expense of an appeal to find out that the
Commissioner’s own counsel says the assess-
ment is not arguable. The Commissioner
—whether of Commonwealth or State —
should find out whether it is arguable or
not before the assessment is made.

For many years Vale of Clwydd coal
(N.S.W.) has paid regular 10 p.c. divs., and
since 1913 that rate has been maintained
on a capital increased by £15,000 of trans-
ferred reserves. In addition, during the
same period shareholders have had 25 p.c.
in special bonuses. Now a further £15,000
of reserves (practically all that is visible
in the published accounts) is being distri-
buted in shares, making paid capital £75,000.
All this prosperity comes from association.
Until a selling agency was established and
other arrangements were made, there was
scarcely a Western coal-mine that gave more
than bread and butter.

Because Victoria is becoming more of a
tadpole State than ever, prices for Mel-
bourne street frontages are soaring. The
Australian Bank of Commerce has just paid
£1350 a foot for the Collins-street premises
of a building society whose large land-boom
oretensions had a horrid smash. The price
is close up to the land-boom figure of 1890.

with their better organisation, got the prize

The advantage of having battery charging current
on tap in the home garage is now within the reach
of every motorist. The Q.E. Mercury Arc Battery
Charger makes any ordinary lighting circuit a source
of energy for starting, lighting, and ignition bat-
teries. Its cost is a mere trifle compared with the
convenience and economy of home charging. An
overnight boosting charge every few weeks will not
only increase the efficiency of a battery, but will
also lengthen the life of the plates. You should

rlie Load and Zinc Conventions arranged by
Amschel, the brains of the Frankfort-owned
Australian Metal Co. Weinberg contends
that as the German cartels put up the price
of lead and zinc to the world. Australia fat-
tened on German enterprise and trade com-
bination. It is all true —unfortunately. And
the most deplorable part of the business is
that Britain seems to be making the same
mess of the trade now that she did before,
chiefly because Freetrade has got her in its
clutches.
"Ex-Banker": Several of the banking
amalgamations suggested some time ago now
look probable. The E., S. and A. Bank
is said to be uniting with the i-ondon Bank
of Australia, which would give a combined
paid-up capital of £1,007,185 and a reserve
fund of £1,057,380. Market movements in
shares indicate also that the Bank of Vic-
toria is flirting with the Royal of Australia.'
Their union would result in a paid-up capi-
tal of £1.778,010 and a reserve of £749,270.
A most desirable strengthening of the per-
sonnel of the Victoria would result, apart
from the large savings in branch expenses.
It would be possible then to pay both staffs
much higher salaries, to which they have
long been entitled.

The conference of Broken Ilill miners and
owners held in Melbourne failed; the owners
were willing to give way substantially on
everything lint the wholesale carving down
of hours of labor, and even as to that they
said they would re-consider the question
when the Commission had finished its inves-
tigations and reported on the effect of mine-
work on health. Apparently Delprat thinks
the others are prepared to give away too
much, so it was announced that the B. 11.
Crop, would not undertake to be governed
by anything the conference might do. Del-
prat. is a direct-actionist: he disbelieves in
compulsory arbitration and wants the right
to light the unions. Practically Broken Ilill
is outside the law, as it is, so Delprat
Ims, in effect, all he desires. Certainly if
he wants more freedom for the parties than
they have he must be a glutton. Some years
ago his co. locked up its mine for more than
12 months, and now his workmen have been
out on strike for 12 months; and what more
can a direct-actionist want than that? There
is talk at the Hill of the cos. now inviting
the moderates to break away from the domi-
nation of the Trades Hall and get to work ;
wherefore the Trades Hall has got busy and
prodded the big Coal and Shale Miners’
organisation into an alleged threat that it
will not in that ease send fuel to the Bar-
rier. But what about taking a ballot at
Broken Hill on the question of accepting
the cos.’ offer? The Labor Government
ought to have a word to say about that.
Meanwhile the Broken Hill miners con-
tinue to use up their capital. At June 30
last year the savings banks had 15,621 depo-
sitors. with £635,599 to their credit. On
March 31 last there were 14,726 depositors
and only £493,602 deposits. In the three
months prior to the strike there was an
increase of 550 depositors and £38,562 of
deposits. The coal-miners have sent them
something like £25,000.

Sailed by the Niagara, Leslie Bradford,
late steel superintendent at the B. H. I’rop.’s
Newcastle works—another brainy Australian
at least temporarily lost to the Common-
wealth. Bradford had been with the co. for
over 22 years, was for many years chief
metallurgist at Broken Hill, and is widely
known for the part he played in the develop-
ment of the flotation process. About six
years ago he was transferred to Newcastle
to organise and equip the steel works labora-
tory. When that had been accomplished he
became superintendent of the open hearths,
and saw that plant through its most troub-
lous period. Latterly he held the position
of steel superintendent. He has twice been
abroad on behalf of the Prop.; this time he
travels on his own account to further the
interests of his own flotation process.
-* *• *. *
The latest metal to be “floated’’ is tin
oxide. Prof. Edser recently demonstrated
in London the possibilities of the process,
showing a recovery of 80 to 90 p.c. chemical
assay, as against 70 to 75 p.c. from present-
day methods. The flotation re-agent is soap,
with an alkaline corrective for the gangue.
If the process can be developed to treat our
refractory tin ores—flotative experiments
have so far been unsuccessful in lifting out
the sulphides of iron. lead, etc., from the
dirty concentrate—the possibilities are very
big.
* * * *
Instead of heckling John L. Wharton and
his Amalgamated Zinc Board, shareholders
ought to hand them a bouquet. Without a
mine at their back they have secured for
shareholders the big end of the stick in the
Electrolytic Zinc Co., and pulled off a fine
deal with the Mineral Separation patentees.
What if the North and the South B.H. and
the Zinc Corporation had declined to fur-
nish zinc concentrates to the Electrolytic,
leaving the Amalgamated only to treat the
300,000 tons tails paid for. and gather any
royalties it could from its patent interests!
Instead, Monty Cohen can justifiably claim
that the lead taken by the Board means that
Amalgamated Zinc has a preponderating in-
terest in what is to' be the "second biggest
enterprise of the kind in Australia.” \\ hat-
ever shareholders of other cos. may have to
say about their directors, the Amalgamated
crowd have no cause to cast mud at
their management. Its feat in arranging an
agreement with the Speck Government, under
which the Electrolytic Ziifie will soon be
getting sufficient power to output 100 tons
zinc per week, was in itself a bit of deft
workmanship.

There are many sore heads over the
Mutooroo smash. The scenario of events
for the 10 days preceding the upheaval runs
this way: the sale of 10,000 shares at 255.
each, wfith the call of 15,000 in 10 days at
the same price,’ and another 12,500 in two
months at 305.; the striking of soz. ore in
the Jessop shaft and ounce ore in the
Osborne shaft; the rush of the market after
shares from 255. to 4Ss.; a visit to the mine
by H. J. Daly to sample it for the Baillieux
and Lionel Robinson, Clark and Co.; the
announcement of 240 z. stone in the JeSsop
shaft; the persistent selling on a big scale
in Adelaide and Melbourne; news of lower-
grade stone in the shaft; the publication of
an assay giving a 21dwt. value ; the collapse
of prices to 17s. 6d.; and the news that
Collins House was off the option. What the
market did was to ignore the consistent
realising, and to give credence to gossip that
the option would be exercised. The heavy
buying opened the way for the big dealers
to get comfortable. To buy at 255. and
sell in a week or two at 355. or better was
to snatch a good profit and get safe if the
run of the mine did not come up to expecta-
tions. That it didn’t is not the fault of the
directors or of the option people. The bulls
squeal that the latter did wrong to empty
out scrip while prices were high. They seem
to forget they were playing not in a nursery
but on the Stock Exchange. That the
directors did well for the co. is proved by the
fact that it has over £20,000 in hard cash
as a result of its sale of scrip. Where the
bulls fell in was in assuming that London
would absorb scrip as it did in the case of
the White Hope; instead, it has been con-
tent to go after market profits. But because
Collins House has swung out Mutooroo is
not necessarily done, though a £300,000
valuation was absurd.
* * * *
Mutooroo Central, which is the old Edna
May Consolidated Extended in disguise at
Hampton Plains, seems to have drawn a
blank. Two 50ft. shafts have failed to give
anything better than sdwt. A fortnight
ago directors tried to cheer shareholders with
talk of the "recent highly-satisfactory
developments in the Mutooroo.” But many
things have happened since then. The co.
some time ago secured six months’ exemption
from its Westonia troubles.

Ituby Creek is a new co. in 40,000 shares
of 10s. each which is out after silver-lead
on the western end of the old Yerranderie
field f N.S.W.). The show has been devel-
oped by a syndicate, a 020 ft. tunnel having
at 220 ft. cut a vein 9in. to 12in. wide,
which has been followed for 40ft. on each
side of the tunnel, and has exposed," it
is estimated, 1500 tons assaying from 560 z.
to 117 oz. silver. Further in, two other veins
have been cut; assays showed 330 z. and 40oz.
silver and 45 p.c. lead. Having got that far
the syndicate wants cash to provide plant,
transport, etc. The public is invited to
subscribe for 20,000 shares, and the vendors
will give one free fully-paid share for every
10 allotted. The vendors get 18.000 fully-
paids (subject to a transfer of 2000 men-
tioned above) and £lOOO cash, thus giving
the co. a Working capital of £4OOO. less pre-
liminary exes. The show is well situated
for water and timber, but is 45 miles from
rail. The co. hopes to overcome its trans-
port difficulties with a motor-waggon. With
silver at present prices the vendors reckon
they see a profit in excess of the nominal
capital in the No. 1 vein alone.

C. E. Delohery, once of the Occidental,
Cobar, and lately back from sampling Wil-
helm’s ironmongery, is in charge of Mt.
Dudley (N.S.W.) nowadays. The run of
ore from which vendor Kirkham crushed
452 tons for £3183 was supnosed to be
making south, but Delohery declared for the
north, and his strike of a few r days ago of
stone similar to Kirkham’s to the north
of the main shaft may confirm his claim.
This north drive had drawn a blank until
rising disclosed ore said to give up to 3oz.
It is only a small make (about 15in.), but
Delohery thinks it is going underfoot, and
he is in pursuit. To the south he has picked
up a sft. reef. 3ft. of which is reported
to average from lGdwt. to an ounce. The
battery has so far had the handling of only
a few tons of 'this ore. and the best it
could do with the latest 518 tons put through
was to. show an average of only slightly
over 13|dwt. Dudley has now six faces
from which it can gouge battery-feed.
After months of weary waiting Gundagai
Long Tunnel (N.S.W.) has the water to
re-start crushing. Since this show was prac-
tically counted out j. 400 tons have been
handled for an average of slightly over the
ounce. JLate-inanager Allen declares that
there are 8000 tons of similar quality ore
exposed. The Bulletin again puts it to
the Mines Department that geologist Har-
per, who said the nasty things about the
show which resulted in the market knock-
out, should be sent to have another look.
Allen, having retired because of ill-health,
a son of the Kenny who was associated
with Rice in the long-ago when sensational
linds were made has taken over. Nothing
came of the English offer to pay £SOOU
cash and put up £30.000 working capital for
a two-thirds interest. Many shareholders
still have faith and were dead against the
deal.
__ All Badak pups have now been told by the
Kedah Government that they are not wanted
in the Jeneri Valley—that is, as holders of
big concessions. Still they may get posses-
sion of small areas, if Badak influence counts
for anything and mining ground becomes
available by sale in the open market. Some
disgruntled shareholders talk of lawsuits, but
they had better consult prospectuses before
deciding to feed Costs. Badak Options is
said to have a Ronpibon claim, but the out-
look for Bux and others is vague. Still,
Badak has a grandmotherly feeling towards
one or two of them. The listing of the Badak
GUO,OOO £1 paid and 400,000 ss. paid con-
tribs on the Exchange has demonstrated that
the market is off the feed, for hardly a bid
has been recorded.
* * * #
Though New Langi, Ararat (Vic.), has
cut down calls from 3d. to Id., the market
is cold. It demands to know what is the
good of talking about drives opening up
profitable runs of wash if calls continue
and the mines are not fully manned. In
the New Langi there are seemingly three
parties in wash and two in the drives, but
six more parties could be lost in the length
of the gutter lying between No. 1 and No.
2 shafts. Surely the ground from No. 1
shaft to the junction with the Cathcart
gutter is not plain mud instead of the oz.
stuff talked about for years? Men, of
course, can no longer be got to work in
slush and slime for the old 10s. a day;
even under the present contract rate the
tally of about 18s. Gd. a shift isn’t any-
thing out of the way as wages go, especi-
ally with Broken Hill offering better pay.
Still, the district is healthy, and gold has
always its lure. Toole is now operating
round about the junction of the Cathcart
with the big Langi gutter, and if gold is not
thereabouts then the old scheme of alluvial
mining at Ararat will not work out accord-
ing to rule. Toole marks out a width of
350 ft. of payable wash there, and as good
samples show in the face he will go out
towards the eastern bank. As neither the
New nor the South Langi has ever cut
across the lead, this is good prospecting.
Bryant’s first diagnosis of Duke Extended,
Maryborough (Vic.), was that it was good
stuff; but, bar a few patches, as develop-
ment proceeded the lead proved to be
cemented and gold contents irregular. Only
profound optimism kept the staff going, and
lately reward has come in the shape of a
better showing off No. 7 rise towards the
old Duke Consols boundary. Dick Glover
now estimates that this will pan out at 15
to 20 dwt. As the ground is drained this
should be about a payable average, but there
is not a big field of wash to operate on.
unless the gutter proves to be a tributary of
the Duke lead. If so, there are possibilities,
for the lead can be w’orked back from the
boundary to where the English crowd cried a
halt 10 years ago. Altogether, Glover has
not done more than emphasise that the
claim is likely to remain a tip-top stringer.
* *• *• #
The Central Blue office is out to give
United Ulster, Bendigo, another go. This
old mine had a tip-top reputation down to
1000 ft., with splendid stone coming from
about the 98Dft. level. Over the boundary
the Great Southern left a section of the
reef untouched, and a new co., promoted
by McColl and his friends, intends to push
out in that direction to ascertain if gold
lives there. Then at 1200 ft. a small saddle
had a fair reputation ; while at 1000 ft. the
policy will be to fasten on to the extension
of the Garden Gully run of stone to see if
divs. are hidden away in a belt of country
handed over by Bendigo Amalgamated for
exploration. The new concern is a typical
Bendigo float: only 42 000 shares, of which
4000 go to vendors, GOOO are to be held in
reserve and 30.000 are to be taken up at
2s. What a contrast to Hampton Plains
gambles!
* * * *
Gone the way of all good mines, the
Hartley and Riley (M.L.), after being
worked more or less continuously for 50
years. Hartley and Riley secured the
original claim in 1802, lodging in Dunedin
10470 z. of gold, and were awarded a grant
of £2OOO by the old Provincial Government
conditional on lG,ooooz. being produced by
the end of the year. They dug out
TO.OOOoz. After the diggers had secured as
much gold as the great depth of the river
would permit, this claim saw the first
attempt to recover gold by a floating dredge,
and an old spoon-type plant worked unsuc-
cessfully for a year or so in the late
’eighties, to be followed years afterwards by
the bucket type, which was so successful,
and which led to the dredging boom of Otago
and later to the adoption of this type of
dredge all over the world. That all the gold
has been won from this stretch of river bed
is most unlikely. The richest gold was got
by the dredge with the buckets dragging on
a clean mica-schist rock bottom, bringing
up each trip not more than two shovelfuls
of rock to the bucket. One week’s work
produced loOOoz. Various schemes have
been proposed for getting at the schist bot-
tom, none so far being feasible.
* * * *
Operations have temporarily ceased at the
little Mara gold-mine (Tas.). Low-grade
ore, irregular deposition and narrow lodes
have made it too costly. A high percentage
of silver is present in the bar gold, reducing
the value of the metal to £3 per oz. I/ast
year’s published output wa.s £2664.

Harrold W. Clapp, vice-president of the
bt. Louis (U.S.A.) Railway Co., who has
been appointed chairman of the Vic. Rail-
ways Commissioners at a salary of £5OOO,
is a son of “Thunder” Clapp, who was for
years chairman and managing director of the
Melbourne Cable Tramway Co. Clapp, jun.,
is an Australian native, and was educated
at Melbourne Grammar. Before going to
America he was in the service of the Bris-
bane electric tramways. Owing to the
just-announced increase of 15 per cent. in.
fares and freights (excluding agricultural
produce), the new chairman may have a
million a year more revenue than any of
his predecessors, while as wages are no
longer regulated by the Commissioners, but
by a Board, he will be relieved of one of
his predecessors’ greatest worries. But the
Oid task of satisfying the farmers, who want
agricultural produce carried for nothing or
thereabouts, is still on hand like a family
ghost.
. One more hasty (perhaps nasty) general-
isation. The Argus says that “only a cad
would boast that he had been offered a title
and had refused it.” Gyles Turner in his
History of Vic. records that Service, Murray
Smith and Alfred Deakin declined sirships.
David Syme (unlike the head of another Col-
Ims-street paper)
put aside the
bauble and allowed
his decision to be
announced. Zeal
told the Yic. Leg.
Council that he had
informed the Colo-

would not have
the bachelor
knighthood ten-
dered him, and
would have a

profiles is just like a dagger, whereas Jowett squares
heavily along the jaw as some apology for the com-
parative pimple on which he wears his hat. Stewart,
the young member for the Wimmera, is all bulging
forehead and bashful nose; Hill’s and Cook’s coun-
tenances have been carved with an adze and reddened
with weather; the outstanding features of Gibson,
the hope of Corangamite, are a pair of ears unfurled
to catch every rumour that blows. Arnold Wienholt,
of Moreton, soaring into the heavens on two legs
like campaniles, is the gauntest figure in Parliament.
A lined, careworn face, fair-haired aloft and wearing
a carefully tended tuft of chin-whisker, gives him
a foreignness of aspect that his frank Australianism
cannot wholly remove. He has done his bit for the
Flag in Africa, and is one of the best big-gaine
hunters in the world. It is alleged that he has
killed so man}' lions that he finds it very tedious
sitting down with the lambs. Certainly at times he
would give Walter Marks and the exquisite Captain
Bruce a strenuous run for the boredom prize.
"Wilson Hall”: I wonder whether any
prof, at the Melbourne “Shop” has had such
an uphill struggle as M. Carton, lecturer in
French. Carton lately related the story of his
early struggles to his
class to illustrate his
maxim of “Two strings
(or more) to one’s
bow.” As a youth he
studied both art and
mathematics, and
gained the two dip-
lomas : these at the
time weren’t of much
use to him, for his
father didn’t believe in
higher education, and
would give no assist-
ance. However, Car-
ton wasn’t discour-
aged. He entered St.
Cyr (the French Dun-
troon), passed all his
exams., and found
himself again without
a sou. So he left the
army, struggled on,
and when the Franco-
I’russian War broke
out, enlisted as a
private. By the time
it was over he was a
lieutenant. When the
army was demobilised
the unfortunate was
again out of work. So
he sailed to Australia,
obtained his present
position, and “Voila! here I am!” he ended
with a smile.
J. W. Jones, who died in his sleep last
week, aged 77, knew South Aus. from end
to end, perhaps more thoroughly than any
other man. He was native-born, entered the
Survey Department 55 years ago, rose to
the second place in it, and then became Con-
servator of Water. He was an expert on
artesian wells and on the river Murray, and
as a side-line gathered a heap of information
about the natives during his Far-North tra-
vels. His elder son was lost in the Calvert
expedition in Westralia.
The not-long-started Vie. Institute of Re-
frigerator Engineers has held its first State
Conference, and, out of compliment to the
memory of James Harrison, founder of the
Geelong Advertiser newspaper in 1840 and
pioneer of refrigeration in Australia, it
chose Geelong as the venue. The local
Chamber of Commerce made available for
sessions its boara-room, and it was not until
the conference was nearly over that some-
one discovered that they whose craft, the
enterprise of James Harrison had made
possible were sitting in what had been
his editorial office, in the premises he
had built for his paper, and which
he had to relinquish when the expense
of his early experiments in freezing
goods for export ruined him financially.
Another belated tribute is being paid in
Geelong to Harrison’s memory: a refriger-
ator plant, with which will go a course of
study in refrigerator-engineering at the
Gordon Technical College—the first such
technical plant and course in the State.
One of S. Australia’s very oldest names
passes out of public notice with the retire-
ment at 77 of J. C. Morphett, Clerk of Par-
liament. His father, John Morphett, of
Morphettville, where the horses now race,
had a long innings first as Speaker of the
old mixed Council before Responsible Gov-
ernment, then as President of the Leg. Coun-
cil. The son, after an Oxford training, be-
came Parliamentary librarian, and since
1877 has been the friend of all politicians.
His retirement means promotion for Arthur
Searcy, author of popular books on the
Northern Territory, where he lived for years.
“Nemo”: Writing of Mrs. Humphry Ward,
the novelist, who died lately, various Austra-
lian daily papers said that her father,
Thomas Arnold, ’verted to the R.C.’s, but
afterwards returned to the Church of Eng-
land. Actually he rejoined the R.C.’s and
died one. Mrs. Ward was niece of Mathew
Arnold, the poet, and Tom was a brother of
Mat's. Her parent had a Tasmanian con-
nection, for he married a grand-daughter of
Colonel Sorell, an old V.D.L. Governor. Tom
himself was for years inspector of schools in
Tasmania and lived next door to St. Joseph’s
in Macquarie-street, where it is understood
Mrs. Ward was born. In conjunction with
the Rev. W. E. Addis, Tom Arnold compiled
a “Catholic Dictionary”—a most comprehen-
sive and accurate work, which is still in
use. Addis was an English Catholic priest
—a convert —but he returned to Protestant-
ism, and ultimately became associated with
Charles Strong’s Australian Church in
Flindcrs-street, Melbourne.
A HINT (IN TUI] AMERICAN
MANNER).
“It is understood that the Allied Council has
decided that President Wilson’s suggested amend-
ments in the Turkish Treaty cannot be conceded.”
The foundations for Victoria’s pioneer
farmers’ union were laid by that upstanding
old legislator, John Moore Chanter, now
M.H.R. for Riverina and Chairman of Com-
mittees in the Reps. He was the convener
of a conference held in 18(53, and carried
the thing through on his own. At that
time he was farming at Rochester, in the
Bendigo neighborhood, and the concern which
was formed as the result of the meeting
bore the same title as the V.F.U. of to-day.
The organisation had some power, too, and
lived for several years. Though it never
reached direct representation in Parliament,
it had a good deal of influence on members.
The late Brian O’Loglden fell foul of it at
one stage, and declared that if its members
wanted the country run their way they could
“get another Government to do it”: and
within a few months O’Loghlen toppled off
the throne. The union never claimed that
it blew him off; but it did allege that its
breath didn’t hefp him to stay.
Gone west, at close on 80, Tasmanian
prospector McGinty. McGinty was one of
the first to brave the hardships of the wild,
wet West Coast, and in 1883 unearthed on
the Rocky River, the Speck’s largest gold
nugget (2430 z.).
T. J. S. O’Halloran, who has been an
S.M. in Adelaide for close on half a century,
had an 85th birthday last week. He accepted
congratulations, but did not let the occasion
hinder his work, spending the day on the
Bench in the Licensing Court.
The Rev. Clarke, who passed out at Bal-
lina (N.S.W.) the other day. was more than
a parson. Among his many inventions were
the naraflin solvent known on the market as
“S.O S.” and a device for exploding shells
—the latter taken over by the authorities
at Aldershot. He had a remarkable museum,
too, including eggs of the comb-crested parra-
keet —a prize for any collector.
During the discussion in the Reps, last
week on Barrier-member Considine’s de-
mand for a Commission to investigate condi-
tions at Broken Hill, a former gallery-man,
Bertram Cook, listened from his old perch.
Most of Cook’s working years have been
spent in the service of the Herald —of late
years as a political commentator. For a
time he was publicity man in the Prime
Minister’s department; then, last year, he
accepted a billet as welfare missionary at
Broken Hill. Soon afterwards the long-
distance strike at the Barrier began and
has continued ever since. That Cook's
time has not been wasted, though results are
not apparent, is shown by the fact that
the B. H. rrop. has signed him on for
another year’s effort at curing what Fowler.
described during the debate in the
lieps. as an “open so-o-ore.”
Died recently, on the Etheridge (X.Q )
old Jim Clancy, probably the first man to
put a pick into the famous Day Dawn
shoot at Charters Towers. The Day Dawn
was a frost for the first few years, but when
Fred Pfeiffer and Tom Christian got hold
of it in 1879 they sank to the footwall and
got a sft. reef. Jim Clancy sent up word
that he had “struck it,’’ and soon there
was an excited crowd from the township
gathered round the shaft. From the sink
in the shaft a first crushing of six tons
gave 71oz. That was the start of the Day
Dawn boom. Clancy had seen 75 sum-
mers when he passed out, and he was work-
ing a claim to the last.
Since Responsible Government was estab-
lished in Vic. 53 years ago there have been
12 Speakers of the Assembly—Murphy, Mac-
Mahon. Charles Gavan Duffy. La lor, Davies,
Bent, Berry, Mason, Gillies, Beazley, Frank
Madden and Mackey. Davies was and
Madden (the only survivor of the ex-
Speakers) is a solicitor, and Mackey (the
present Speaker) is a barrister. Murphy.
MacMahon, Duffy, Davies, Bent, Berry and
Madden were knighted. Mackey will be
before long.
The cares of State seem to weigh heavily
on Irvine, C.J., who stalks the streets of
Melbourne with never a smile to light up
his frosty features. He has gone by his
own exertions from the emigrant of Armagh
to Chief Justice of Victoria, and now
remains for him the honor of greeting the
Prince of Wales as acting Cocked Ilat of
the State. And when he welcomes young
Wales at St. Kihla in the name of the Aus-
tralian people the thoughts of many will
fly back to a certain John Mitchel, his uncle,
who was in the ’4B time one of the best-
loved of all the Fenians, and who died an
exile, with his Ireland still not free.
James, who was the only soldier member
of the Queensland Labor Government, joined
the Opposition after his return from abroad.
He reached Parliament via the persuasive
platform way. “Ryan’s Thousand” was get-
ting too much leading from behind, so James
decided to give it a lead at the front, and
regardless of losing the German suffrage in
his constituency he hopped into khaki. Before
entering politics lie was a carpenter, but
finding that the pen was mightier than the
saw he entered the Inky Way. Ilis social-
istic writings while sub-editor of Brisbane
Truth helped him to the Labor endorse-
ment for the Logan. In bis moments of
depression he got the wanderlust, and went
jazzing with Matilda in all parts of Aus-
tralia ; and when work was scarce he
mounted the soap-box and told the proletariat
about the nearest route to Utopia.
11. W. Osborne, who was farewelled at
Scott’s, in Melbourne, the other night, before
leaving for London to try to get a free
market for co-operative companies’ butter,
is one of the men who have done good for
themselves and for
business by aban-
doning journalism.
Twenty years ago
Osborne was the
star man for the
Warrna m b o o 1
Standard. After
turning down an
offer from a Mel-
bourne journal, he
became secretary of
the Warrnambool
Shire, and led a
lotus-eating life for
a few years. Then
he became manager
of the Western Dis-
trict Co-operative
Co., and draws a
bigger screw than
a metropolitan
newspaper - mana-
ger.
TOM GIVENS,
President of
the Senate.
Prince Edward hasn’t struck quite a new
idea in dancing and so on with tradesmen’s
girls. The Duke of Edinburgh spent most
of his first evening in Westralia (he had
dropped ashore unexpectedly) talking to a
confectioner’s daughter in High-street. He
was incog., masquerading as a middy.
BE GOOD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Be good to Mary Ann,
AVhile still on earth yon wander,
For goodness best befits a man —
A fact all men should .ponder.
If she should nag, don’t fret;
All women born are grievers.
Be grateful still—you can’t forget
Your honeymoon’s shy fevers.
Be good to Mary Ann,
And when she whimpers pet her;
Woman is built on such a plan
That lots of things upset her.
So should she flirt with Jones,
Asserting still her beauty,
Flirtation breaks no husband’s bones,
And blindness is his duty.
Be good to Mary Ann.
Swift runs the sand, and swifter.
The youthful course you ran
(Of morals no uplifter)
Should in the retrospect
Make you a spouse complaisant;
As says St. Patrick (I expect)
“If you’re not good, be dacint.”
Be good to Mary Ann.
Mark, lurking in each dimple,
There grins a little imp to fan
Emotion in the simple.
A woman’s not too old
For love till she is eighty;
Tend well your own connubial fold,
Adjuring Tot and Katie.
While still on earth you wander,
Gooaness befits a man
(A fact all men should ponder) —
Be pood to Mary Ann.

JUNES : “G etting married Saturday week.
Brown. Have to snare a few days off for
the honeymoon. How tony do you think
I ought to ask for?”
BROWN : “Difficult to say, old man. Haven't
seen the girl.”
“Magnum” : Those dear old gentlemen of
the Union Club (Sydney) who won’t drink
anything but French champagne will, I am
afraid, have to go thirsty. In spite of im-
ploring cables, three months old, referring
to the Royal visit, present Australian stocks
:i re insignificant, and strictly rationed to
favored buyers at a trifle less than £l5 a
dozen.. The damage to Rheims is still be-
yond all calculation; but every letter from
the well-known houses there repeats the
sad talc, with no variation —serious short-
ages ; curtailed orders; little hope of any
extensive future business. With exquisite
French courtesy they say “Messieurs, it is
the parting of the ways.” Australian
sparkling wines (and lest you should think
I am interested let me say that I don’t
handle them) are available at less than
half the price of imported, and according to
connoisseurs, European or local, are but very
little inferior. While it is true, perhaps,
that champagne, rightly so called, can only
be turned out to perfection from grapes
grown upon a particular calcareous sioil
within a restricted area in the Valley of
the Marne, it is equally true that the local
substitute is a high-grade wine made under
ideal conditions from grapes grown in a land
that is blessed by every natural aid to
perfection of vintage-culture. Notwithstand-
ing this, few products at present display
such a remarkable disparity in price between
imported and local manufacture. Jazz rooms,
clubs, hotels, caterers, private hosts who
have hopes of entertaining Royalty, are
scouring the Commonwealth for French
wines (a few odd bottles are picked up in
Nevertire, and Bogabog station offers its
club three more), every bottle of which
will run its usual course during the festi-
vities. After that the drought will be a
drought indeed.
“R.K.” (Vancouver) : Have you tried a
Jaky-jazz-joltV It is the most recent dis-
covery of the miners and loggers of British
Columbia, and is the outcome of the steady
effort of those hardened Westerners to dis-
cover a drink with a “kick,” despite pro-
hibition. The Jaky has been given official
cognisance, and by no less a person than the
Vancouver chief of police, lie explained to
the members of the Police Commission that
the drink was brewed by pouring essence of
Jamaica ginger (hence the “Jaky”) into the
near-beer which is permitted to be sold and
which must not contain more than 2.75 p.c.
alcohol. The drinking of this “jolt” has
reached such proportions that the Legislature
of British Columbia has brought in special
amendments to the Prohibition Act J:o deal
with the sale of ginger-essence and lemon-
< xtract. Under these the sale of such tinc-
tures in bottles of more than 4oz. is forbidden.
At the March meeting of the Vancouver
Police Commission the chief told the story o F
the Jaky-jazz-jolt, lie declared that most of
the cases of drunkenness seen on the streets
were caused by it and not by whisky. Atten-
tion was called to the heaps of empty extract
phials swept up near the hotels and which
indicated the extent of the habit. Followers
of the Jaky are able to buy their extracts at
any grocery store. Then they enter a soft-
drink bar, call for near-beer and pour the
(‘xtract in. It produces either a condition of
sodden intemperance or acts violently. But
there is no doubt as to its sudden popularity
with those who are determined to get results.

“Zanthus” : Practically all the Westralian
section of the Nullarbor Plain, except
some of the northern edge and a
few patches elsewhere, has now been
taken upon pan tor a l lease,
the area running to over
30,000,000 acres. Some of
it was taken as a spec, before
the railway was open, but
most of the leases have been
issued in the last year or
two. Although a few hold-
ings in the timber country
east of Kalgoorlie are already
stocked, water will have to
be provided before the plains
are much used; so far, out-
side the timber country, the
stock consists of a few head
of cattle at places along the
Sunset line. S. Australia
hasn’t issued any leases for
her share of the plain,
though it includes better-
looking country than any-
thing on the W.A. side. One
of her difficulties is that she
hasn’t been able to get the
instruments to run out the
exact position of the inter-
State boundary where it crosses the plain.
But it will be a long time before a mile or
two more or less matters.

“Ex-Dig”: The Digger was as casual in
his quasi-matrimonial affairs as in most
others, but that he was ready to “do the
right thing” when it became necessary is
shown by the news that there are only 800
infants being looked after by the Australian
Children’s Society, which is taking up the
job in Britain neglected by careless A.I.F.
fathers. Considering the multitude of Dig-
gers who dissipated their leave and their
periods of .training and convalescence from
wounds and sickness in England, 800 is
not a large total. The A.I.F. authorities
helped the Diggers as much as possible to
act squarely by girls who were too confid-
ing : the fact that there were urgent rea-
sons for marrying a girl was sufficient to
get any man marriage-leave from the
trenches; and even confinees were allowed
out, under arrest, for the purpose of getting
married. Of course, some men tried to
“work” this concession; and one man man-
aged it twice successfully. On each occa-
sion he explained that when lie got to
Blighty he found urgent reasons why he
should not marry the girl. His bold attempt
to get a third leave, by drawing official
attention to his papers, was his undoing;
and the memo which refused his application
added satirically: “In view of this soldier’s
habit of involving himself with women, it
is deemed advisable that he should be de-
prived of opportunities of getting into
further trouble in this respect. He will,
therefore, be granted no further leave until
the periods to which, in the ordinary course,
he would be entitled exceed by the ordinary
leave-period the leave he has already
obtained by his representations of marriage
necessity.” The SOO before-mentioned in-
fants are to be provided with a home in

“Jonah”: This isn't the first time Admiral
Halsey, the Prince’s chief-of-staft', has seen
a haka; only last time the Government
didn't stage-manage it, which made a
lot of difference. In these degenerate
days if the thing is left to Henare
the result is far from thrilling or
impressive and is often ludicrous. During
the visit of the New Zealand Ilalsey and
staff visited Russell (North Auckland) to
witness a war dance. After taking in large
quantities of roast pork, the Maoris came
forth to do the haka. They were garbed in
the most extraordinary collection of clobber
it is possible to imagine. Some wore trousers
and no shirts; others had shirts but no
trousers. One hero wore a pair of flaring
red underpants. Halsey and his companions
endeavored to take the affair seriously, but
finally broke up. The climax occurred when
a Maori “princess” made a wild dash at
Prince Henry of Battenburg and kissed the
pale face of the young aristocrat. Her
stout and elderly female relations, chuckling
loudly, immediately barged in with the in-
tention of following her example. Henry
wore a worried, haunted expression, and cast
an appealing glance at Halsey, who tactfully
looked at his watch and murmured “Home!”

22/4/’2O) was only a calf by comparison
with that let loose by a member of the Vic.
Assembly in 1903, when speaking on the
Irvine Government’s proposal for separate
representation of public and railway ser-
vants. He described the bill as “a nulla-
nulla with which the Government is trying
to bludgeon the. State servants into submis-
sion, but which will in time to come turn
round and bite the hand that had fed it.”
And he was right, too.
“Amos Iveeter” : Add this hull to the herd.
It was let loose in an election campaign up
New England way many moons back. Mick
O’Dublin was questioned as to his attitude
on the “Absentee Tax.” “Tax thitn absen-
tays,” he thundered, sweeping his arm so
as to send the water-bottle into the lap of
a very mild and tolerant chairman. “I’d
tax ivery mother’s son of ’em ! This coun-
try is over-run wid absentays!”
“Broker”: Died lately, in Sydney, a man
whose case illustrates the old adage that the
creaky door may still have good hinges.
Thirty-eight years ago he was employed by
a city firm as traveller. Financial disaster
engulfed him, and he met the principals one
morning with his sorry tale. The matter
was serious, involving large amounts. While
negotiations were proceeding, paralysis dealt
him a stroke, and quickly changed him to a
wreck, whose life seemed to be certainly
limited to a year or two at most. A
settlement was effected by handing over an
insurance policy on his own life for a large
amount, which practically covered all short-
ages. lie never walked again, but lived
d 0 years, during which time the firm paid
over £4OO in premiums. Two of the prin-
cipals of those distant days pre-deceased him
by 18 and 12 years, the third by a few weeks
only, dying suddenly in good health, while
the old paralytic slipped into dotage.
“Kelby": I was attached to a crack Eng-
lish regiment for a time. Most of the officers
wore monocles and were fellows in High
Sassiety. Consequently even frantic orders
from lI.Q. didn’t worry them much. We
were sitting in mess one night, just after
the Armistice, when an excited orderly-room
clerk rushed in with a telegram for the
C.O. It was marked “Urgent” and said

‘•Pubs are places that 1 never have frequented.”
“You dare,” his Worship thundered, “to stand
calmly there and state
That your visit to the Itoyal was invented!”
“No! No!” admitted Blithers. “But 1 didn’t know
which way
My feet were pointing till, to my vexation,
1 found myself inside the place. 1 merely wish to say
I'm suffering from disorientation.”
“Maybe,” rejoined the other, in a tone of disbelief;
“llut, explain, if you are competent to do so,
The reason why you penetrated promptly to tln-
ch ief
Beer-retailing bar, like some drink-questing
Crusoe.”
“My one desire,” said Blithers, “was to reach the
street outside,
And get away from alcohol’s temptation:
The object which I cherished was, I grieve to sav,
denied
By what 1 mentioned—-disorientation.”
“Presumably,” his persecutor answered, with a sneer,
‘l our .affliction was to blame for that which fol-
lowed :
It led you to immoderately soak yourself in beer;
it was guilty of the whisky that you swallowed.”
"Exactly,” said the prisoner ; “I knew I’d but to
speak
To make you grasp in full my explanation.”
“You have.” rejoined the other. “Forty shillings or
a week.
That's how the Law views disorientation.”

HURRYING HIM ON.
BERT: “Do you think your father would say
anything if we told him ire were going
to he married ?”
BETTY: “I don’t know. But I think he’d
make a dreadful scene if he- found out
before you told him.”
“Amalekite”: According to some of the
old-timers, “the Valley,” Brisbane’s toniest
business quarter, had its beginning in a
house made of coffin-boards. At Roma-street
was a cemetery, from which the contents of
the graves were later on removed to Milton.
One of the men employed in digging up the
graves didn’t like the waste of good material
in sound cedar coffin-boards, so took them to
his cottage in the Valley. It was the same
man who. while engaged on the job, raised
a coffin-lid. and the sudden exposure to the
air caused an old cap on the skeleton to
fall to pieces. He was somewhat dazed for
a moment, but recovering his self-possession
exclaimed, “Keep your cap on, my good soul!
Sure I’m a poor man just like yourself!”

“T.P,”: One of our Vic. inspectors lately
crossed the Murray and invaded a N. S. Wales
school. "I am an inspector,’’ he said. The
pedagogue crossed himself, said the only
prayer he knew, and
bowed with becoming
reverence. The visitor
added, “A Victorian
inspector!” N. S.
Wales became perpen-
dicular again, and
they had a salary yarn.
The inspector subse-
quently addressed a
meeting of Victorian
teachers and stated
“That man, teaching
50 children, gets with-
in flO of my salary!”
Of course this doesn’t
mean that N. S.
Wales teachers are
overpaid ; but, Lord !
doesn’t it throw light
on th e sweated Vic-
torian ! The Bulletin
blames teachers for
not blazing with in-
dignation. Right!
Press, politicians and
the rest have kicked
and sneered at
teachers for half a
century. Now that
the teachers have a
union of 3000 and
curse at the top of
their voices, Parlia-
ment is sitting up and
commencing to take
notice ; and the Argus
gave a column on April 9. We’re moving!
* * * *
“Paul C.”: N. S. Wales Education
Department should do one of two things to
be at all fair to teachers who take economics
in their examinations—either confine the
questions set to phases of the science that
admit of no two opinions, or advise the
examinees of the political faith of the exam-
iner who will deal with the papers. To take
one question from the paper set at the last
examination of teachers :
“Be patriotic. Buy Australian-made poods. Why
waste your wealth by importing?’’ Is this sound
economic doctrine?
The wretched examinee on viewing this is
not concerned about its soundness or rotten-
ness. What he worries about is whether the
examiner is branded Protectionist or Free-
trader. And if he guesses he may guess
wrong and hand in poison when he aims at
supplying meat.

“Albatross”: Whenever I see a leader-
writer asking the world how it thinks a
ship would get on if it had two skippers I
recall the (say) Josephine, a steamer run-
ning out of Sydney, which for years traded
on the coast but is now making deep-sea
trips. She carries two skippers, one per-
manent, the other a “shifting backstay.” The
permanent man is a pet of the owners; but
because he has only a
“dog-license” ticket' he
cannot take the vessel
overseas. Though he
draws master’s pay, he
signs articles as third
mate ; but, as a matter
of fact, he bosses the
ship and —at the re-
quest of the owners—
“handles” her whilst
in home waters. But
any smashes he makes
cannot legally be
attributed to his neg-
ligence—that is a
privilege reserved for
the real master. Only
recently he had an
accident and caused
considerable damage;
but it was the other
skipper who got the
sack—and some hush
money to put in it.
“Official’': Creches are admirable, of
course, but they have their disadvantages.
People who deposit babies with us are so
absent-minded. Frequently mothers go away
and forget altogether where they left baby, and
often enough when mother does return, hav-
ing left a girl, she claims some other’s boy.
You think this incredible; it happens almost
weekly. The shocking inability of ma to
identify her own darling has forced us to
adopt a scheme of identification. On one
occasion a young woman who had claimed
her babe at six in the afternoon returned at
10 at night, with her husband, both in a
terrible state of mind, declaring they had had
a strange baby palmed off on them. They
produced a pair of brown bootees in proof.
Their darling had never worn brown bootees.
With copious tears the woman demanded her
own. I believe she would readily have parted
with the baby for any old thing wearing the
right bootees, but we were able to prove it
was the right baby and the wrong
bootees, and order was restored, even
if perfect conviction did not possess pa
and ma. About a week later the same young
woman called to inquire if anything had
turned up. She was still dubious. Finally.
HIS MISTAKE!
“I’ve often wondered why a fine woman like
you never got married
“And I've often wondered how a little squib
like you ever did."
Well, please,” she said, “my husband and
I would like to try another one, if you don’t
mind.”
* * * *
“Sejadee”: Saw a Nature’s gentleman the
other day. He called on his girl about sun-
down, while she was in the back yard cutting
wood. He sat watching her swing “Kelly”
for 20 minutes, and then the axehead flew
off the handle. “Bring me that axe,
Sarah,” he drawled. After putting in about
10 minutes fixing the head on the holder
securely, he handed it back to Sarah. “Here
you are,” he said, “i’ll bet a quid the
thing won’t fly off now.”
* * * *
“Widgee”: A large sparrow-hawk came
and hovered over my back garden yesterday
morning, with an eye out for his lunch. It
reminded me that the first aviation prize
offered by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment was for a hovering aeroplane.
Since those remote days inventors seem
to have lost sight of the possibili-
ties of this principle in aviation, yet if
a hawk can hover so can the right sort
of ’plane. Australian inventions, such as
Brennan’s torpedo, De Mole’s war-tank and
Dyer’s curburetter, suggest that there would
be no harm in Australia renewing its offer
for an air-machine which will be able to rise
straight up off the ground and remain poised
in mid-air when required. A prize of £50,000
would be a trifle compared with the accru-
ing benefits to the Defence Department; and
an offer of this handsome sum would be an
excellent and cheap ad. for the Common-
wealth, anyway.
* * * *
“P.X.”: In one of the most-American
families in Sydney the discovery has just
been made that the only member of the
household who probably isn’t a British sub-
ject is a daughter who was six months old
when she left the U.S. 20 years ago. Father
had no doubt about his nationality : but, with
Australian-born children who knew not
Fnele Samuel, and with an Australian busi-
ness, he reckoned it was a fair thing to be-
come naturalised. He sent along the neces-
sary papers, and was the most surprised man
in the continent when he was told, in reply,
that, since his father was born in Canada]
and he himself was now in British territory]
he was already a British subject. His wife
is. of course, consequently British, too; but
apparently their daughter, born in the
U.S.A isn’t, though it is possible that,
having lived in infancy in Australia with
a British father, she is deemed to be Bri-
tish. (Anyway, a child living with a natu-
raljsed British subject becomes automatically
British.) -There must be dozens more in the
same position: the sons and daughters of
Irish parents, for instance, though born in
the British subjects in Australia.
e\ en though the parents may have become
liatuialised American citizens years before
the chiidren were born. These children, born
in the States, are certainly also American
citizens when they are in the U.S.A. • so
it seems, they have all the privilege of two
citizenships—they are whole-hog Britishers
in Australia and lull-fledged Americans when
they are in the U.S.A.
t > >r * * *
“P.”: Bagmen will wish a cordial cliin-
cliin to Bongfield, a N. S. Wales P.M., for
dismissing a charge against a Finley pub-
lican. The “Crown” argued that it was a
breach of the Licensing Act for travellers,
atter arrival, to booze at divers pubs during
several subsequent hours. The defence
claimed that a bond fide doesn’t
cease to be one as soon as he has dropped
into a drinkery. It might be necessarv for
him to shift the first pub’s beer might be
bad, or the saleslady might squint. The
question, of course, is, how long could the
voyage legally last? When would the
traveller cease to be a “traveller”? Long-
field, P.M., didn’t answer that.
* * * *
The Eight Hours processionists flowed
along Melbourne as usual last week for all
the world as if they hadn’t heard rumors of
a six-hours day. Ninety-four unions, which
is rather more than the average, turned out.
All the banners represented Work, and
gloried in Work. Most of them had the
number “8” inscribed in letters about 2ft.
long. The symbolic figures were lusty with
life, and glowing with health—the life and
health being derived from that blessed thing
Work. The crowd that lined the streets
was quite as large as usual, but more silent.
It seemed conscious of the incongruity, not
to mention the irony, of the situation. The
processionists were also silent. To walk
behind a banner that advocates eight hours,
while you yourself are on strike for six
hours, with higher pay at that, calls for a
measured step and a serious frame of mind.
* * * *
“Iiio” : The releasing of prisoners or greatly
reducing their sentences on the declaration
of peace has become with us such a recognised
thing that penal servitude has no terrors for
the war criminal, who is usually a peace
criminal, too. With capital punishment
abolished the gaol-bird who enlists knows
that he can commit any crime whatever,
with the only result that if caught he will
have far more comfortable quarters than the
boys in the line, far less chance of wounds
and disease, and be free as soon as the fight-
ing is over or soon after. Similarly the
coward finds a safe retreat until danger is
past. It is the well-behaved Diggers whose
leave and other privileges are restricted and
whose reputation is lowered because of the
doings of these others that suffer most. Next
war Australia threatens to be the recognised
home for shirkers of all nations and its
army the rendezvous for cosmopolitan
criminals.
THEY FALL OUT IN EITHER CARE.
THE GIRL: “Do you think it is safe to he
married in the air?”
THE AVIATOR: “Just as safe as on the
ground.”
“C. Troop”: Corporal Joe and I were
unsaddling on our return to camp, after de-
livering some captured Turkish mules to
the Tommy depot at Ludd. “Have any
trouble?” asked the sergeant. “No, we soon
got rid of 'em,” replied Joe. “Struck a
good sort of officer in charge, a gentle-
man.” “That’s good,” said Sarge. “Yes.”
continued the panegyrist, “ ’e didn’t want no
reports in triplicate. Just told us to tie the
s to the line and get to . A
gentleman!”
JAZZ.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oil, 1-1-lovely ankles and bloomy backs and billow-
ing dimpled— Cr-r-rash !
Away we swirl on the shiny floor as the crackling
cymbals clash.
Shoving and shoved go galloping round with a flitter
of frantic feet
As the jazz-mechanics express tlieir souls in a manner
absurdly sweet.
hist to the cackles of*.ecstasy and the gurgles of
sheer delight:
boshter music! ’ and “Yes, they’re playing some
bee-yewtiful things to-night.”
Doesn’t the mu-hoo-lioosic thrill you through to your
inmost soul—
-Ihe piercing squeal of the piccolo and the spare-
drum’s snarling roll,
Dreamy or dashing, or just-plain-noisc like the shift-
ing of furniture?
Jfyself, I’m having a truly most unusual time, I'm
sure.
Hark to the vision in purple-pink with the wonder-
ing eyes: “You’re right!”
i urrum-ti-thumpity ! — “Ain’t we having a beautiful
time to-night?”
With a rattle-and-bang and a stirring screech and a
spasm of screaming strings
The jazz-band tells its whirlwind tale of impossibly
joyous things,
And my senses swim as I sniff the scent of your
marvellous, marcelled hair,
Glutting my gaze on your beaut-toot-tooty, swirling
from here to there,
With a dowager snorting beside my ear a panicky
“Hold me tight!”
Slither and blither and blare, we’re having a dizzy
old time to-night.
Ah, le-lie-hean on my heaving chest and let us career
some more
While, here and there, with a thund’rous thud on the
glasslike dancing-floor,
Some giddy old boy goes flumping down with his
wishbone out of place.
Or a plump young gran’ma comes to grief in trying
to set the pace.
Amid pink masses of bouncing miss, with glad eyes
shining bright,
I’m having a trooly-ooly beautiful time indeed to-
night.
With a bangety, blankety nrfn-ti-t-um as a help to
your whirling toes,
threading the tangle of ding-dong belles and prettily-
prancing beaux,
Doesnt it make you gay to sec the flappers in shriek-
ing flocks,
The butterfly-flutter of daring dears in the faintest
of phantom frocks
And the bobbing-around of bald old bucks, in the
clobber of youth bedight,
Putting the kybosh on creeping age with a frivolous
time to-night ?
Oh, 1-1-lovely ankles and shoulders bare and dimples
of every sort,
This is the place for me, I feel, for an evening of
harmless sport!
On with the dance till the windows glow with the
blushes of rosy dawn
hile the .jazz-band brays like a cowless calf or
wails like a soul in pawn.
To-morrow I’ll be a tame old thing with a bit of
a grouch, all right,
But at present I feel like a two-year-old—it’s a
devil I am to-night!

The Studebaker
“Light Four”
IT is claimed for the 1 920 Studebaker Models that
they are “Beautiful in Design; Thoroughly
Modern; Mechanically Right.” Examine these
claims.
On the first point, you can trust the evidence of your
own eyes. Scrutinise the first Studebaker Car which
comes under your notice. Note the elegance of
design, fine lines and the luxury and harmony of the
upholstery.
The 1 920 Studebaker incorporates every element of
improvement which scientific and engineering skill
has evolved. Studebaker construction is always on
the crest of the wave of advance in motor-car
development.
“Mechanically Right!” There is abundant evidence
in support of this claim. Carry your attention to
the appended list of Special Features. Vou will
find there an assemblage of attributes which explain
the uniform and high-efficiency service rendered by
these cars.
Moreover, the Studebaker is designed and built with
a keen regard for Australian needs and requirements.
The man who buys a Studebaker expects complete
satisfaction —and gets it.

BARNES-LINSEED OIL
Goiiger ’: I have just dug from my claim,
which is in an old river-bed long buried by the
countless deposits of earth from forbidding Mt. Fin-
layson (Q.), an old stone-axe made apparently with
great labor from a piece of steel flint. It is seven
inches long, four wide and oval-shaped on both sides
It tapers to an edge that the centuries have
long since dulled. Across the head of the axe is
a deep groove, doubtless for the insertion of the
handle. I unearthed the implement 10ft. below
the surface, and it makes the sixth found _ so far.
proving that a considerable blacky tribe must have
inhabited this district about the time that stone-
axes were the fashion in Britain—probably even mam-
centuries before. The blacks shake their heads on
being shown the implement, for the pattern is dif-
ferent from that used by their own immediate
ancestor.’.
* * * *
‘‘Bill R.”: Herewith my evidence on the
charge of cohabitation of cat and ’possum. At our
camp on Jincumbillv Plains (N.S.W.), miles from
the nearest belt of forest and a camel’s journey
from the next habitation, our only cat took to sport-
ing nightly with a ’possum that offered the alluring
eye from some willows along the creek. By and bye
a youngster was produced for our admiration by
our tortoiseshell lady. The exhibit was ’possum in
color and covering, and, when it grew up, it showed
a natural inclination for crouching, ’possum-fashion,
with low head and arched back in the trees at night-
fall. It took after its lie-parent,' for an accidentally-
thrown stone knocked it one day beyond recall. It
was eight lives short.
* * * *
“Barcoo”: I have had more than a little
experience with the alleged tame dingo, and always
found him unreliable, useless and ungrateful. As
a sheep-dog he is a heartbreak to the shepherd.
He will “run cunning” when sent round the flock,
cutting off a “wing ’ of the sheep, w-hieh is dis-
astrous to the drover. He will bite you and also
your jumbuck when you are not looking, and when
your flock is sticking you up the mongrel will make
for the nearest shade half a mile away, ignoring the
most coaxing entreaties for assistance. In a fight
he is a cur. I had one in a droving outfit, and
when his owner neglected to tether him at night
he used to enter the sheep-break and kill one or two
jumbucks for sport. I broke him of the habit with
a bullet.
* * *
“G.”: In my wanderings around New
Guinea I always found the people of the interioi-
honest citizens while the coast people were sharpers
all the time. A Whitechapel Jew couldn’t show some
of the coastal niggers points. While buying spears
and curios I have caught a dusky thief in the bow
of the boat stealing things I had just bought and
stowed there, his intention being to resell them to
me at the stern! I hate to chalk it up to our
discredit, but these mountain people don’t often
retain their honesty long after they have come in
contact with the whites. Incidentally, the moun-
taineers arc invariably shorter in stature than the
coast niggers and more peaceable.
* * *
/anthus”: The Kimberley country is one
° f . the f ew parts of Australia where the abos. are
•still a serious hindrance to occupation. There are
big areas of good cattle land up there which are left
alone because the original inhabitants have a play-
ful way- of spearing cattle and an occasional stock-
lt is reckoned that there are 40,000,000 acres
in East Kimberley not taken up for this reason.
The native tribes are not so far as accommodating
in the matter of dying out as they are in other
places. As the result of a good supply of game
and fish they are fine, big, well-developed fellows
The W.A. Government is seeking some means of
reconciling modern ideas about the treatment of
native races with a desire to make the land avail-
able for pastoral settlement, but it hasn’t found
one yet.

Dolphin : Betsy Island, at the mouth
of the Derwent, has had rabbits on it for about a
century. Soon after 1820 a hopeful citizen set in
to breed the long-haired sort there with the idea
of sending their skins to the China market. lie soon
gave up the enterprise, but the rabbits stayed on
and their descendants are there to-day. As the
island is only about 600 acres they must be well
in-bred. But rabbits have maintained themselves
for many rabbit generations on much smaller areas
than that, such as soifie of the specklets off Wilson's
Promontory (Vic.).

“Herbert Beecroft”: Talking of old birds.
I have at Woollahra (Sydney) an English ring-
dove which has had 26 Christmas dinners. If he
had not fallen into my garden on his first and
only flight in 1893 he might have lived just the
normal three or four years. However, he was
picked up a helpless fledgling and given a roomy
cage. He has always been well, and, so far as
I know, happy and contented, and though a bache-
lor has never seemed lonely. He is still in good
feather, although a little stiff with age latterly, and
he now rarely coos and has for some time left off
flying around the room. The little chap was
included with my baggage when I arrived in Aussie
from England 15 years ago.
“Forester”: About the toughest of all
bushwork, not excepting wattle-barking or log-
fencing, is burning. It isn’t quite so bad in grass
country, where it is soon over, but in the scrubby
and timbered country of Tasmania, for instance,
its a fair cow. You have to work furiously, and
be scorched and smoked on the top of it. The
custom is to clear and rake a train and then light
along it while other citizens with beaters made of
gum-boughs or anything else handy watch behind
to beat the fire out when it runs across and to
put out the sparks that fly into the fence. And
if it is an old log-fence with the “sap” on the
ogs rotten and as dry as tinder, the sparks will
light up fast enough whenever there’s a shift of
wind to blow them. Where you can get water to
IT RAN IN THE FAMILY.
GOOD PERSON: “What a well-behaved little boy your son is, Mrs. Snoot!”
MRS. SNOOT: “Oh, yes, it’s inherited, Ma’am. His yore father always got his sentence
reduced owing to ’is good behavior.”
dowse the sparks it isn’t so bad, but it hurts when
you have to put out a healthy young fire with your
hands. It’s bad enough when you have a train arid
everything ready, but it is ten times worse when
a big fire comes on top of you and you have to
do everything at once. I have known men to work
day and night for a week with only a few hours’
sleep, and to end up with all the hair scorched off
face and aims, and their eyes so affected by the
smoke and glare that they were practically blind ;
while the clothes were nearly burnt off them. As
to driving a man to drink, there’s nothing like it
Two of us one day absorbed five gallons of tea, and
more water, which we let run into us whenever we
struck a creek or waterhole. We could not drink
more tea because there wasn’t any more.
* * * .
“Quick Dick”: For “Timo” and other
Sydney cab-drivers molasses may be a curse. Grain
and decent chaff are easy to obtain in Sussex-street.
But let “Timo” offer his prad some of the chaff we
have to use in the droughty parts. Even a starving
horse will hunger-strike rather than eat the mousy
c aff we have to rely on. And the only way we can
persuade him to give in is to mix molasses with it
one jam-tin to a kerosene tin of water. It’s the
worst stuff in the world for his teeth, but it makes
him eat. Also it gives him a good glossy coat. And
a live prad with bad teeth do-’s far more ploughing
than a dead one with good molars.
“Crabtree”: One member of a platoon I
belonged to managed to keep himself warm with the
one blanket that was carried into the line. He
always took two sheets of brown paper and a piece
of string with him. When he turned in he removed
his boots and made a parcel of his feet, then placed
the remaining brown paper so that, when he pulled
the blanket around him, the paper would rest against
his back and shoulders. In the morning he used to in-
vite mates who had been shivering all night to feel
the warmth retained in the brown paper.' It is in the
shoulders, the small of the back and the feet that
uncomfortable cold is felt; even the knees do not
trouble if the feet are warm. With use the hard
crinkle had gone out of the paper, which had become
as pliable as a blanket. I have tried the same trick
myself; but usually the paper got astray or went to
the making of a dugout fire.
“Bright”: Where did “Spuds” (B.
S/4/’2O) come across the crow that was able to
take a full-sized hen’s egg in his beak and fly away
with it and not break the egg? I do not attach
any importance to the statement that “Spuds” has
seen crows carry off china eggs, as they are fre-
quently much smaller than a hen’s egg. I have
noticed again and again that when flying with an
egg in his beak the crow has a grip on the extreme
end of the grub. Also that when he alights he
does not wait to knock a hole in it but commences
the snack right away. By the way, I have yet to
see the crow who, having secured a piece of food
of any description, drops it after having carried it
a hundred yards through the air.
“Two Seas”: Rc the egg-stealing crow.
Notwithstanding “Spud’s” sarcasm (B. 8/4/’2O),
Bright” is absolutely correct in describing how
the hen-fruit is carried. I have often got off the
mark quickly at the sound of the hen’s signal and
been beaten by the bush outcast, who invariably
carried off the prize impaled upon his beak. How
else could he carry it? “Spud’s”' crow that carried
off china eggs must have been a cockney reared
in Sussex-street. He probably wanted them as a
presentation to a Nationalist candidate. P.S.—
TEE SCAPEGOAT.
“Do you think your father would mind if
I made a sketch of your cow?"
“Oh, no. But I warn you—if she goes dry
he'll put the blame on you."
The artful devil carries apples the same way as
egrgs, simply because he can’t get his top lip over
them, and a merciful Providence refrained from
supplying him with a sack like a kangaroo’s.

THE BATHURST ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This road, whereon the dust lies still
In noontide’s steady glow,
Weds East to West, and Coast to Plain,
And Now to Long-ago.
Grey men with arrows on their garb,
Beneath grim law’s sharp spur,
And worse than arrows in their hearts,
Its sullen builders were.
Browbeaten, cursed, a hopeless host.
Of love and pity starved,
Through iron rock and iron wood
Its wending way they carved.
Through bitter hours of thirst and heat.
And cursed by brutal tongues,
They toiled, the white dust in their eyes,
The red dust in their lungs.
And now and then, to soothe their brows
That burned with fever-flame,
Deep draughts of coolness from the depths
Of great, green gullies came.
And sometimes, met in tall gum-trees,
The green bush seemed athrong
With singing birds that sought to smooth
Their martyrdom with song.
And times there were, when slaves no more
To pick and gad and maul
And hurt of oath and hurt of lash,
They heard far waters fall.
The road remains, though they have passed
Like leaves before the gust:
for Time, whose mills grind evermore,
Has ground them into dust.
“SAY, BOSS, YOU GOTTEM OLD SHIL-
LUN’ YOU DON’T WANT?”
No more with lash and curse to urge,
No more with gibe to goad,
How good, how sweet was sleep to them,
The builders of the road!
To those who care to pause and heed,
To those who dream and feel,
The road still echoes to the sound
Of foot and hoof and wheel.
•Its length recalls the Turon days,
The stream that flooded West,
The eager, urgent human tide
That on and onward pressed;
The travellers with their scanty all
In barrow, swag and cart;
The horsemen, singing as they rode;
The footmen blithe of heart.
The road remains; now red, now white,
From crest to crest it streams;
But dust are they—their bones, their flesh,
And less than dust their dreams.
Though gone they be, and gone their hopes,
And gone their goal that glowed,
A giant still, upon its back
It bears its living load.

It Stops Gear Noise
is no need for that nerve racking
1 noise of gears. A little TEXACO Crater
Compound will stop it. Crater will silence
any noisy gear on any machine in workshop
or factory. When Crater comes, the noise stops.
This rich adhesive lubricant covers each and every
gear tooth with a non-dripping, non-drying film
that stays where it is put. It keeps the gears coated,
and prevents metallic contact. Where you have no
metallic contact, you have no noise and no wear.
If you are not using TEXACO Crater Compound, you should
investigate it. Why not order a can of Crater now—it will
talk for itself.

‘Full House” : The Government of Papua
is a most paternal one towards brown brother. Gam-
bling is looked on with a stern eye, and fine and
imprisonment is the lot. of Percy Papua if he is
caught enjoying a flutter at “king in, king out,” a
game at which the haughty bronze knuts are very-
adept. Like his brethren of China and Malaysia,
the Papuan young gentleman would joyfully stake
his soul, and he is not bej'ond “borrowing” his Aus-
tralian employer’s possessions for a night’s amuse-
ment with the cards. 1 remember the mighty wrath
of my neighbor Jones when he found a skin-diseased
member of the local nobility inside his one and
only much-treasured suit of evening clothes! And
I desire to be excused from repeating the remarks
of a lady in Moresby whose house-boy, a cheerful
“black Jew” from the Fly River, in excellent humor
one morning, passed his mistress a handful of
silver, which he said belonged to her. “Why does
this money belong to me, Losimaru?’ she inquired.
“True, Sinabada, he money belonga you. More
better you put him alonga bockus [box]. You buy-
em something belonga you,” he replied. “1 no can
talk lie for you,” he continued. “I been Clistian

“Buzz”: They can tell you the probable
height of a coming flood at Rochester (Vic.) with
considerable accuracy. The rainfall at Kyneton, 100
miles south, is the key. A 24-hour total of llin.
to 2in. signifies a banker; Sin. means a moderate
flood; while 4in. to oin. is calculated to inundate
every house in the town. A more industrious com-
munity would be difficult to discover than the 2000
r.ddiesters on the receipt of a “four-inch wire”!
l-vei-y hand is at work, often throughout the night,

THEATRICAL MANAGER (to applicant for

THEATRICAL MANAGER: “No, but the audi-
ence would."
shifting goods and chattels above the expected high-
water mark, while every now and then a patrol
reports the progress of the waters. The Rochester-
folk, although possibly their town is the most-
often- and worst-flooded one in Australia, usually
treat the visitation good-naturedly ; but strangers to
the place are, not unnaturally, scared by the rushing
waters.
* * # *
“Northerner”: Gilruth, ex-Administrator
of the Northern Territory, in giving evidence before
Hie Commission inquiring into the maladministra-
tion of the country, said there was
no place in the world where a person
could live more cheaply than in the
bush up there. “1 called at a survey
camp once,” he said, ‘‘and had a most
delicious meal. We had kangaroo-tail
soup, baked barramundi, roast wild
goose, roast turkey and yams. For
breakfast we had curried goose eggs
and fried barramundi. You could not
wish for anything more delicious. The
goose eggs could be had in abundance,
and the blacks caught the barramundi
for the camps.” The horse-doctor was
speaking of the Daly River; but the
menu he extolled is not in it with
some meal programmes I have had on
the Adelaide River. We had for
breakfast buffalo steak and fried goose
eggs; spatched teal or cold whistling
duck, goose or turkey; goat cutlets
and kidneys; hot damper or johnny
cakes. Water-melon was the fruit.
Dinner usually consisted of turtle
soup and fried fish of various kinds, a
buffalo or zebu joint, with yams and
pumpkin; baked turkey, goose, duck
or teal. All these are to be had
without exertion. Game! Why the
Adelaide, Alligator and other locali-
ties simply teem with game. If you
tire of goose eggs there are scrub
turkey and turtle eggs. Turtle eggs
are delicious. Crocodile eggs are also
plentiful ; but I bar them, although
the niggers call them No. 1 tucker.
* * * *
“Widgee”: To keep “D.J.” from going
completely off his dipper, a condition he alleges
to be threatened by a plague of cockroaches in his
dwelling, I recommend a 4-4-1 mixture of castor
sugar, powdered borax and arsenate of lead, to be
blown into their haunts with a bellows. The borax,
I understand, acts on any eggs it touches, while
cock, hen and little ehickie ’roach, attracted by the
sugar, eat heartily thereof and die of a severe pain
soon afterwards. This remedy also serves for Nor-
folk Howards and other domestic pets. Borax, by
the way, sprinkled on all places where flies breed—
notably the manure-pile in the back garden—is now
recognised as the sovereign remedy for the fly
nuisance.
“Yin Blong” : I’ve been waiting patiently
for someone to ask an easy way to find north in the
bush. But as no one wants to know I’ll tell him.
Watch out for an ants’ nest under a tree —in most
districts you won’t have to look far—and it’s 1000
to 1 that, in Australia, the nest is on the north side
of the vegetable.
“Pick”: The sport of night-time duck-
shooting has an allurement that the day-hunter
knows nothing about.
There may be shivery
hours lying in wait for
game among the damp
reeds of morasses, but
that is a trifle to the
keen sportsman inten-
sely alert to read every
sound borne upon the
stillness. Because there
will be but a momen-
ta r v phosphorescent
flicker on the water
when the birds alight,
he has to be a light-
ning snapshot with the
gun. By the whir of
wings overhead the
expert knows what
kind of birds are pass-
ing, and whether they
are bound for pools
afar, or wheeling on
to . near-by feeding
grounds, and he must
beware of showing
himself to plover,
crane or seagull, whose
raucous cries at seeing
an interloper would
ring warning to every
bird in the region.
Also when swans
waddle ashore and
twist long, squirming
necks suspiciously in
his direction, or cur-
lews peer at him over
the rushes with round staring eyes that glow in the
shadows, he has to know well how to act the drifted
log, or his game will be up for the night.
“F.W.F.”: The returned Digger was per-
spiring on a job for the local Hoad Board in front
of the pub, and Bung was standing on the
verandah gazing on the exertions of Billjirn. Sud-
denly the latter, throwing down his “banjo,” walked
Up and said : “Boss, would you let me have the loan
of a pen, ink and paper?” “Yes,” said the publi-
can; “what do you want it for?” “I want to
make out my will,” explained the Digger; “I’m
dying from blanky thirst!” Bung came to light.
“Wee Bobbie”: For varieties of fish I
have never come across any other place to equal
Lunga River, in the British Solomons, during the
whitebait season. Every new moon if the sea is
moderately calm the whitebait come in their mil-
lions. The water close in shore is brown, with them.
One can fill a bucket with a few scoops of an old
mosquito net. Savage-looking sharks, with gaff top-
sails set, tear through the brown shoals and gulp
them down. All sorts of fish follow the whitebait,
feeding on them the while. With one drag of a 50
by three yards net we caught 170 fish, and in that
haul I counted 27 distinct species.
* * * *
“Baree” : The N.T. is still unexplored by
naturalists, so the blacks on the coast who talk of
monkeys that live in trees may not be the liars
they have been called. A party of them once brought
me an animal with a long tail, carnivorous teeth,
no pouch and thick fur. It was about twice the
size of an ordinary rat, and was totally unknown to
anyone in the camp, though we were 12 men from
all over Australia and all well used to the bush.
Malays may have brought from Asia birds and animals
that in time accommodated themselves to the Terri-
tory. Apropos, who first introduced marram-grass to
Australia? It grows for miles along the foreshore
of Anson Bay, and was there before white men
camped there. There are, too, tamarind trees at
least 12 or 15 inches in diameter growing up there
—trees that cannot be less than 50 years old. They
are certainly not Binghi’s, for he never cultivated
anything.
* * * *
“Haragigi” : Forty years of missionary in-
fluence in Milne Bay (Papua) has converted the erst-
while bloodthirsty and man-hungry natives into
uncompromising Sabbatarians. I came to Gabaga-
buna one Sunday morn with about two tons of gear,
one boy and the prospect of a seven-mile tramp in
an atmosphere reminiscent of a hot-house. My
request for carriers met with the response: “Alto-
gether boy he no wantem work Tong Sabati.” My
hired assassin solved the problem. “My taubada,”
he explained, “want to catchem Waigani, he ’nother
kind taubada, big fella Gub’ment, friend b’long
Jesus.” It worked like a charm/
* * « *
“D.F.”: “Breast-hoes” or “hand ploughs”
are still in use in one or two orchards in the Speck
where the ground is loose and sandy. The operator
pushes with his breast against a flat piece of wood
set on the handle and shoves the machine forward,
steadying and guiding it with his hands. It is
easier than hoeing in the orthodox way, as there
is less strain on the arms and back, and it is also
quicker. And of course the band plough can be
used amongst the trees where a horsc-hoc could
not go.
“Gleniris” : Now, about the domestic “tri-
antelope.” Merely cast an unfriendly glance at the
critter when he is sunning himself in the window,
and he will tear for the cushions on the window-
seat at as near a mile a minute as possible. But if
his long-legged nibs should be lounging on the
outside of the pane, and you thump your knuckles
on the glass just in front of his nose, he will merely
blink and keep on lounging. Bill Triantelope seems
to have the right sort of brains for his job.
“Mrs. Dance Rawson”: The North Queens-
land abo. who stole another fellow’s gin was not
allowed a heilamon (shield) to defend himself with.
A circle was drawn about three feet in diameter,
and in that the accused stood armed only with
his throwing-stick. Then three of the nearest male
relatives from each side had so many shots at him
with their short spears which the target could only
parry with his stick. It used to be a marvellous
exhibition of skill and of quick sight ifi most cases.
If the offender succeeded in going through the test
without receiving a scratch the woman became his,
but if he were wounded that ended; his career with
the tribe. He became an outcast, and the woman
went back to her lord.
* * * *
“Bright”: We used gypsum in the far
west of N. S. Wales to clear muddy water. Place
a piece on a shovel, put it on the fire and leave it
there until it is soft enough to be crushed into fine
powder. A teaspoonful thrown over-night into a
kerosene bucket full of the muddiest water will
clear it by morning. Bushmen in our part of the
country were seldom without their baking-powder
tin full of slaked gypsum. It cost them nothing—
the mineral is common.
* * * *
“Devilfish” : An ingenious way of coaxing
sheep off the runs so that they could steal them
more easily is credited to the old-time “speculators
in wool” in Van Diemen’s Land. Knowing that
sheep fancy young, green grass, they used to burn
a long, narrow strip of country through the bush
leading from the back of some selected run to a
convenient spot. When the new grass came up
the sheep would go after it, and somebody would
help them to forget to return.
* * * *
“Norbell”: In the smokeroom of the s.s.
Mourilyan, on the way from Townsville to Cairns
(N.Q.), we were skiting about our 1 wide knowledge
of Australia and Australian conditions. Presently
an old, hard-bitten Bananalander, with as much
superfluous flesh on him as a slate pencil, chipped
in. “Any o’ yous ever bin in th’ Gulf Country y”
Some of us had, and said so. “Ah!” he went on.
“Ever bin out ter Gammon If hit, b’yond Sozzlc-
bong?” No one had. The ancient grunted. “An’
yer kids yerselves yiv bin back!” He paused for
a few draws. “Fust time I struck th’ Flat,” lit
went on, “I goes inter th’ store an’ arst th’ bloke
f’r two bobs’ worth er terbaccer. ’E gives it ter
me, an’ I planks down a quid. ‘Wot’s this ’ere?’
ses th’ bloke. ‘A pow note,’ I ses. ‘Go hon!’

“Oh, that’s all right! I’m smoking the dad’s

an’ goes over ter th’ post orfis. ‘Mister,’ I ses,
‘gimme two stamps.’ ’E gives ’em to me, an' I
shoves a ’too pelt at ’im. ’E takes it as nacheral
as I’d take a beer, an’ ’ands me back four ’possum
skins. 1 looks at ’im, an’ thinks I'll set ’im

o’ th’ ’possum skins, ‘gimme some spendin’ silver,

A POSSIBLE LIFE SENTENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Dr. Eugene Fisk, well-known American physi-
cian and medical author, at the annual meeting' of
the Medical Society prophesied the ability of science
to prolong life for 1900 years. The life of the
fruit-flv had been stretched 900-fold, as the result
of researches.” — Cable.
I see the pacing funerals pass, and in hot anger
hiss.
“Another resignation! Whose extravagance is thist
liis share of this young nation’s debt has now
devolved on me!
O Death, where is thy sting? Life’s fangs are
labelled £s. d.”
If I must live two thousand years to gratify the
whim
Of some confounded scientist, I’ll have a word
with him;
This complex life I have to lead exhausts my
patience till
I yearn to go away and be a hermit on a hill.
So if I live two thousand years I’m going to be a
Nark,
And from my dank and dismal cave at nervous*
travellers bark ;
I’ll bang my staff and claw my beard, and, as they
turn to fly,
I’ll howl, “It’s cheaper to be dead! They would

is as old as humanity Many readers
will have recollections of old-fashioned
people who always carried mascots c~
against certain specific evils or dangers,
such as rheumatism, drowning or the
influence of the evil eye. They seldom
talked about these things and were
perhaps a little ashamed of them ; but no-
thing on earth would have induced them
to part with or neglect to wear them
The Mp=t®=dlate motorist
laughs at the recollection of these old
world folk, and will tell you, in nine
cases out of ten that he carries his mas-
cot “for the fun of the thing. Perhaps
he does; but there are cases in which he
most emphatically does it for a much
more serious reason. At any rate mot-
oring mascots by the hundreds are now
on the market varying from dainty artistic
productions to the ugly and grotesque.

The U.S. Navy from Within
From Midshipman to Rear-Admiral, by
Bradley A. Fiske, of the U.S. Navy—selected
for this page by a foremost literary critic
of the U.S.A. as “the American book of the
month”—is chiefly interesting as the revela-
tion of a vigorous and original personality.
There is nothing of the “silent sailor,” so
familiar to British tradition, about this
cousin of ours. He dares to be an egotist
from the first page of his book to the last,
lie seems to have been more inventor than
naval man in his earlier days—an oppor-
tunely-sold device alone enabled him to get
married ; and at one stage he 'nearly aban-
doned the sea for a business life. As the
outcome of his activities in tlrs direction
he is the proprietor of over 60 American
patents, as well as many foreign ones. The
inventions range from a new sort of lead-
pencil to the torpedo-plane—a combination
of aeroplane and torpedo which was just
becoming a powerful force at sea when the
Armistice arrived. Sir I’ercy Scott won
fame by his system of fire-control. The
British admiral gave it to the world in 1910.
Fiske mentions that fact with some bitter-
ness. “Fiske’s range-finder and elevation-
indicator” appeared in IS9O. The evidence
seems to be conclusive that Fiske invented
the telescope sight as used on the guns of
every navy in the world, as well as for
direct fire with field-guns. Amongst his
other contrivances are an improved stock-
ticker, a stadimeter and a novelty in insu-
lators.
As showing the difference between British
and American service-conventions, Fiske was
allowed to sell all his devices to private com-
panies. Stokes, the inventor of a gun
which saved in British lives the equivalent
of millions of pounds sterling, got nothing
in cash when the War Office took over his
weapon, and it was not till 191 S that he
was even handed one of the “ration” orders.
A “mention” was the only meed of the ordi-
nary soldier- or sailor-inventor throughout
the war, and he was not allowed to sell his
ideas in the open market. But the oddest
example of the detached attitude of the U.S.
Government towards its servants is found in
a casual remark by the Admiral that he had
demonstrated the merits of his range-finder
for the benefit of the British, French and
Italian navies. And there were no protests
from any quarter!
Fiske was a man of ideas in other direc-
tions. As early as 1910, being then a mem-
ber of the General Naval Board, he called
for the establishment on Luzon Island of
four aeronautic stations, each to contain .100
aeroplanes and to be fully equipped and
manned. He claims that this was the first
proposal ever made for using aeroplanes for
major operations. In an essay on “Naval
Power” he wrote :
Since Great Britain and the United States are the
wealthiest countries in the world, and since the
probability of war between any two countries is
least when their navies are equal in power, the
maximum good would be attained by making the
United States navy exactly equal to the British
Navy.
“I think,” he proceds in italics, “that this
was the first declaration ever published of a
doctrine that now has many advocates.” It
is a Muter one, tor an nun.
Y\ hen the Great War began he was one of
the very senior U.S. Admirals. He was also
a man of energy and imagination and a glut-
ton for work. The inevitable row began with
the longshoremen. From the moment he
starts to write about the politicians Fiske
becomes as recriminatory as Fisher and
Scott are in their books; and as Nelson
would have been had he written a book. His
great aim in life, as a sailor, for years prior
to the war, had been to bring* about the
establishment of an efficient naval general
staff to co-ordinate the efforts of the several
bureaus which constituted his country’s
techincal Naval authority. This ambition
became intensified as the march of events
after 1915 showed more and more clearly
that America’s neutrality could not endure. It
naturally brought him into conflict with
Josephus Daniels, the Naval Secretary,
whom he estimates as a rather inferior
Camille Pelletan—one who, by an exagger-
atedly democratic attitude towards the lower
deck, would divert attention from his total
ignorance of naval matters. Nothing was
further from Daniels’s intention than to allow
the formation of a powerful war-staff of
sailors, and he fought the eminent men of
the Navy strenuously on the good old issue.
He employed the immemorial tactics of the
office-man in every country. The naval ex-
perts—men such as Dewey, Sims and Fiske
—proclaimed, with the freedom which
appears to be the rule in America, that war
was imminent and that the Navy was un-
prepared. Daniels replied that war was not
coming, but that if it did come the Navy was
ready “down to the last button.” Daniels
had the customary quota of supporters,
with, at any rate, an appearance of technical
knowledge; and they countered the argu-
ments of the efficiency school by charging its
members with “Englishism”—a difficult
accusation to disprove and a damaging one
in a country with a tremendous anti-English
population.
Of course the advocates of preparedness
went down. They always do. Had their
advice been followed, and had the U.S. spent
a few million dollars getting ready between
1914 and 1917, the taxpayers would have
been saved a vast sum and the punch of the
TT.S. Navy would have been a great deal
heavier at a time when a heavy punch was
most needed by the Entente. As it was, a
nth ting Navy and an Air Force had to be
suddenly improvised at ruinous cost; and
neither of them proved entirely satisfactory.
This dispute between the sailors and the
politicians, which came to a head on the day
America and Germany went to war, is still
raging detrimentally to the service. But it
looks as if the Admirals were at last coming
into their own. Anyhow, a majority report
of the committee which s inquiring nfco
U.S. naval decorations upheld last month
the contention of Sims that “the policy of
Mr. Josephus Daniels. Secretary of the
Navy, in decorating officers who lost their
ships, was detrimental to the Navy.” The
inquiry was started owing to Daniels's high-
handed action in ignoring a recommendation
of the Naval Board in the case of his
brother-in-law, Commander Worth Bagley:
the Board recommended Bagley for a Navy
Cross and Daniels gave him a Distinguished
Service Medal. But Daniels can be weak on
occasion. When the North American
Review printed Fiske’s first article on the
need for preparedness the Naval Secretary
declared that if the writer “had not been an
Admiral lie would have had him court-
martialled.”
Such of Admiral Fiske’s book as is not
devoted to naif self-laudation, or to the im-
becilities perpetrated by civilians who
attempt to run navies, is an entertainingly
written story of the life led by the average
naval officer of most nationalities. There are
cruises in tropic seas, social functions and
adventures of different sorts, including some
little wars. As showing the perfunctory, not
to say innocuous, nature of the latter, on
the day before the Battle of Manila, in the
Filipino War, Fiske took his wife for a
drive so that she could “look at the arrange-
of the fort and the American and Filipino
trenches near it.” (The Century Co., New
York.)
Poet, Painter and Poisoner
Amongst the 150,000 convicts transported
to Australia, the most eminent, from the
literary and artistic point of view, was
Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, who died of
apoplexy in Hobart Town in 1852, after
spending 15 years as a prisoner of the Grown
in Van Diemen’s Land. Of this strange
but perverted genius Oscar Wilde said that
he was “not merely a poet and a painter, an
art-critic and an antiquarian, a writer
of prose, and amateur of beautiful things
and a dilettante of things delightful, but also
a forger of no mean or ordinary capabilities,
and as a subtle and secret poisoner almost
without rival in this or any age.” ,And
Swinburne has noted him as equally power-
ful with “pen, pencil and poison,” though
as a matter of fact, poison seems to have
been his best medium. Still as a man of
letters and of art, a dandy and a collector
to boot, he cut a very respectable figure in
the London of the eighteen-twenties. He
was a close friend of Charles Lamb’s, and it
was at a dinner given by Lamb that De
Quincey met him. “Amongst the company,
all literary men, there sat a murderer,” he
says. Wainewright had a picture at the
Itoyal Academy which William Blake pro-
nounced “very fine”; he wrote excellent but
rather rococo prose, and was a keen critic of
art and of the stage. Wordsworth was his
favorite poet, and to the end he was wont to
turn the subject to “Poems Founded on the
Affections” when anyone sought to draw him
on his poisoning exploits.
As a result of this reticence and of the
loss of the diary in which he recorded the
result of his experiments, we know little of
his methods. The poison he used was
strychnine, and he appears to have carried
crystals of it in a ring, like Caesar Borgia.
He began in 1829 by getting rid of his
uncle, Thomas Griffiths, in order to gain
possession of Linden House, the uncle’s resi-
dence. Next year he poisoned his mother-in-
law and a few months later his sister-in-law,
the beautiful Helen Abercrombie, a girl of
20. A drawing of Helen Abercrombie
by her artist-poisoner brother-in-law is
still in existence. It was when a friend
reproached him with this murder years
later that he made his famous reply:
“Yes, it was a dreadful thing to do.
But she had such thick ankles.” The poor
girl’s life had been insured for £lB,OOO in
various offices. When the companies, sus-
pecting the true facts of the case, refused to
pay, Wainewright was bold enough to pro-
ceed against one of them ; but the action failed.
Still, he got back at one of the companies
which treated him so shabbily, the Pelican,
by persuading a friend to insure his life in
it for £3OOO and then putting a grain or
two of strychnine in his coffee. It does not
appear that he himself made any money
out of this little job.
Wainewright fled to France, but in 1837
he returned to London, where he was acci-
dentally seen by Forrester, the Bow-street
runner, and arrested for forgeries committed
13 years before. He pleaded guilty, and
was sentenced to transportation for life, his
poisonings not coming into the question. At
Hobart Town he was for a while, of all
things in the world, a wardsman at the hos-
pital. It is alleged that in two cases he
tried to poison persons who had offended
him. but both attempts were poor failures.
In 1844 he presented a petition to Governor
Wilmot praying for the indulgence of a
ticket-of-leave, in which he speaks of him-
self as “tormented by ideas struggling for
outward form and realisation, barred up
from increase of knowledge, and deprived
of the exercise of profitable or even of
decorous speech.” Surely as strange .a peti-
tion for a ticket-of-leave as was ever pre-
sented : yet it failed in its purpose.
In Hobart Town Wainewright returned to
the pencil and did sketching and portrait-
painting. Forster mentions in a note to the
“Life of Dickens” that in 1847 Major Power,
then stationed at Hobart Town, sent to his
sister, Lady Blessington, a portrait of a
young lady, by Wainewright, of which it is
said that he “had contrived to put the expres-
sion of his own wickedness into the face of
a nice, kind-hearted girl.” But his occupa-
tions failed to give him the interest he
sought, and he seems to have sought refuge
in opium-eating. His only companion at the
end was a cat.

A New Way to Pay War Debts
The Famine in Europe is a verbatim re-
port of the proceedings of the International
Economic Conference which was held re-
cently in London. The British representa-
tives were such well-known pacifists as Lord
Parmoor, P. A. Molteno and Norman Angell;
most of the foreigners were Germans or Aus-
trians. The nominal aim was to devise
means to fight the famine which is alleged
to be raging throughout the Continent.
Every speaker stressed the sufferings of tne
women and children. Thus Miss V. Ograno-
vitch said
In Russia I have seen children who, takiijg raw
fish home frcm the shop, could not restrain the
temptation to gnaw it in the street, or even, fear-
ing to be punished, sucking the tail or head. I
have seen women and children who cried with
joy and thanked God on their knees for the gilt
of a herring or a few potatoes.
As against this W. T. Goode, Principal
of the Graystoke Place Training College
(London), who has just completed on behalf
of the Manchester Guardian a tour of in-
vestigation in Russia extending from Reval
to Moscow, remarks (“Bolshevism at
Work”) :
In the Ekaterinsky Square (Moscow) is a huge
(school) building.... The children are mostly from
the working class. They were in the very best of
health and condition.
And again:—
One of the things most carefully impressed on
me before leaving Reval was that in Moscow I
would find no children under 10 years of age. All
younger, 1 was informed, were dead. The truth is
that both Moscow and all parts of Russia I have
visited swarm with young children from babies in
arms upwards.
The European famine, like the death of Mark
Twain 30 years ago, seems to have been
greatly exaggerated. And in the case of the
apologists for Prussianism who have been
conferring in London, the motive is fairly
obvious. When the moment came to suggest
remedies Lord Parmoor .said: “The Peace
Treaty as it stands appears to me to be an
impossible document.” Mr. Molteno: “It
is absolutely essential that the terms of the
Treaty should be revised.” Baron Ofen-
heim : “The whole of the political and terri-
torial arrangements of the Treaty are un-
satisfactory.” Mrs. Swanwick: “The re-
visionist movement is making great progress
in the Labor party.” Mrs. Duchesne: “I
and the pacifist political and trade-union
groups with which I am associated have
strongly protested against the Peace Treaty.”
Dr. Guttman, Dr. Ellenbogen, Dr. Wieser
and others expressed similar views. Among
the after-effects of all greajt wars are depre-
ciated transport, land thrown out of cultiva-
tion and lessened labor-power: that is to
say, a food-shortage which persists or ends
according as the beaten nation either pulls
itself together and works, or despairingly
subsides into anarchy. Publications like
The Famine in Europe are really propa-
ganda on behalf of the second course. They
practically put it to Germany and Austria
that, provided enough noise is made about
the women and children, the Entente nations,
and more particularly France, may yet be
bilked. (The Swarthmore Press, Ltd.. Lon-
don.)
The Inky Way
“P.x.” : S. M. Herald, having discovered
that there is an Australian literature, sug-
gests that a store should be opened in Lon-
don for the sale of Australian books. This is
pretty rough on the Britisii-Australasian,
which has a ground-floor bookstore in High
Holborn with a stock of Australasian books
that could hardly be bettered in Australia.
And it is run, too, by people who know Aus-
tralian literature and have themselves done
something to fill the shelves.
“Fleet Street”: Another one has de-
scended from the Press Gallery to the floor
of the House of Commons. Charles Palmer,
long time Parliamentary sketch-writer for
the Globe. London’s oldest evening paper,
has been elected for Wrekin after a strenu-
ous three-cornered contest. He is thus fol-
lowing in the footsteps of the Australian
J. F. Hogan, who did the daily Parliamen-
tary review for the Globe before blossoming
into an Irish M.P. A score of celebrities
have come down from the gallery to the floor
during recent years, among them Lord Chief
Justice Russell of Ivillowen, Lord Justice
Duke, Sir Gordon Hewart (present Attorney-
General), Sir Edward Clarke, K.C., Sir
Henry Dalziel, Justice McCarthy, T. P.
O’Connor and S. L. Hughes—the last a
very witty speaker as well as penman, who
has just passed away.
MY TESTIMONIALS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They lie in piles about iny den,
The volumes which of old
Upon stout shelves were wont to stand,
Full oft their titles have been scanned
By visitors, who told
Me how they “loved” to read, but were,
Alas! without the time to spare.
I felt for these the lofty scorn
Which true booklovers know
Whenever mental weaklings blab!
,-Vnd now my volumes to some drab,
Dull auction-room must go,
I can declare quite honestly
They’ve been as trusty friends to me.
At all times they were ready to
Pay tribute to my worth;
For years have they the rumor spread
That I’m remarkably “well read”;
And I have known no dearth
Of admiration since the tip
They passed anent my scholarship.
They were indeed my dearest friends—
Those books I did not know
Sufficiently for them to e’er
Become a bore, and yet were there
To make a goodly show
And testify to all that I
Was full of aspirations high.
Though tomes with uncut pages are
Included in each pile,
I grieve not that they were unscanned;
I’m wise enough to understand
That for the classics I’ll
Till death a vast respect retain
Which close acquaintance might have slaii

UNIFORMITY.
Uniformity is the secret of success of any good product.
It’s the reason Willard Batteries with Threaded Rubber
Insulation are making such a wonderful record of long
life without repairs.
Ordinary materials used for insulation between battery
plates are taken just as they come from nature, and can’t
be made uniform by any process
But Threaded Rubber Insulation is built up by a
scientific manufacture. Every piece of it is like every
other, and almost invariably Threaded Rubber lasts as
long as battery plates.
No wonder many of these batteries have given three and
four years of uninterrupted good service.

“Gpuger”: The greatly-increased price of
shellfish of every class has made business
boom at Thursday Island. In one shed alone
£5OOO worth of .shell was recently stacked.
Under a new agreement all pchrls are now
the property of the fishermen, and this has
brought Japanese pearl-buyers to Thursday,
as their countrymen are the fishermen. Tne
brown men are thriving. Their merchants
and shipbuilders already cater for the fish-
ing fleet’s necessities; and in a very short
time the Jap will absolutely own the Barrier
fishing-grounds.

“Croson”: Milk-condensing cos. are getting
such high prices for their stuff for export
that they are cutting into the Melbourne
supply; so Melbourne’s infants are threat-
ened with a shortage. One citizen, becoming-
suspicious of his milk-oh, carefully measured
his supply, and found he was getting but 14
pints for the quart he paid for. He thought-
fully published the fact, whereupon dozens
of others discovered they were being simi-
larly “had.” One man tried eight “milkies”
one after the other, and found that the fur-
ther he went the worse he fared. Between
H.C.L. and S.W. life nowadays gets really
interesting.

“Gwy” : One of the most soulless pieces of
commercialism I’ve seen for a long while
stares shamelessly from the cover of the
catalogue of the Adelaide Peace Exhibition.
It is a representation, in colors, bronze, rib-
bon and all, of the Victoria Cross, with the
words “For Value” (a cheap parody of its
motto “For Valor”) printed across the top
of the ad. If the S-A. Chamber of Manu-
factures, which organised the exhibition, was
too busy to censor its catalogue before publi-
cation, doubtless it now has ample leisure,
and the show lasts until the end of May.
The same protection against the commercial
instinct which is given to the word “Anzac”
and colorable imitations thereof ought surely
to be extended to the V.C.
* * * *
“Good Australian” : When the glad news
came that exchange had lowered the value
of the franc and the lira so seriously that
it was profitable to buy in France and
Italy, with these standards of value rising
and falling between 40 and 48 francs or
40 and 48 lira to the pound sterling, nume-
rous wily merchants cabled orders to Mar-
seilles and Genoa for large quantities of
the things made in France and Italy. When
the first of the goods arrived here an
obtuse Customs Department looked up its
ready reckoner and decided- that there were
25 francs or lire in a pound, and that duty
was chargeable on the pre-war basis. One
invoice I saw from Marseilles totalled £6l.
valuing the £ at 48 francs. The Customs
worked it out at £llB and charged 45 p.c.
on that! So the cables have been choked
with messages cancelling French and
Italian orders and sending to the U.S.A.
instead.

It looks as though sugar will .soon be Is.
a pound, and it may be more. Australia
consumes about 300,000 tons a year, and it
will have to import nearly half its next
year’s supply, for cane-growing is on the
decline and beet has hardly started. Beet
is regarded by the orthodox as an outlandish
vegetable, unlike wheat, which is quite
British. The importers’ price will be the
price unless it is possible to compel the local
grower to take a lower rate, and in that
case thqre will be two similar varieties in
the grocer’s window —our own at 6d. and
the stranger’s at Is. If the farmer and
planter don’t buck at that the sugar-workers’
unions will. And it isn’t a case, as with
clothing materials, where very much can be
done with the importer, for he doesn’t make
the extraordinary profits that he does on some
lines. There is a world scarcity, so Aus-
tralia must either famish or put in some
mighty hard work. Just before the war
Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia sup-
plied about 4,500.000 tons of sugar, or a
third of the world’s consumption ; and they
are at present growing revolutions and politi-
cal theories instead of beet. Nobody really
has much to sell, especially in exchange for
paper money, and this country is more likely
to find a fly in its tea than anything else.
THE MATHEMATICS OF MAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Eight hundred barmaids registered during the four
months allowed by the Vic. Licensing Act passed last
session. Under the provisions of two previous Acts
approximately 2000 were enrolled. It is, therefore
estimated that the supply of women entitled to serve
drinks in hotel bars will not run short for some years.”
Others may sing of grey horses and ships,
Of politics, waves or the sky ;
/ sing of 5000 pairs of red lips,
As many brave busts on well-corseted hips,
A ditto supply of blue eyes—-
’Tis a subject to fill every student with cheer,
The statistical view of the maids who pull beer.
Acres of cheeks which are hand-worked in pink
And gallons of giggles and frowns,
Several tons of wait-a-while wink,
Much graceful effort in handing out drink,
'And numerous shopfuls of gowns ;
With their work truly done Art and Nature in joy
Do a peaceable jazz which is haughty though coy.
Ten thousand yards of the brightest-spun gold,
Half hair and the rest of it knack ;
Lady-like glances the least trifle bold,
Patrician eyebrows m tally untold,
But all rich and ruscious and black—
’Twould be useless denying that such wholesale girl
Sets the most mathematical brain in a whirl.
Five thousand girls of vague age and vast girth,
Including two thousand named May—
Banish arithmetic, let there be mirth,
Work is a thing for the lean years of dearth,
let us put studies away !
Does not everyone know that affairs prosper well
When our souls are made glad by the figures that tell!

Too weary to go out —too indifferent to seek the
relaxation which he needs-and would enjoy.

a fairyland of real pleasure. All the favorites in light operatic
music, ragtime, folk songs or old time ballads can instantly
be played. You arrange your own programme and play it as
your mood dictates. Bedtime comes in surprisingly quick time —
bringing with it the sweet slumber of a mind refreshed.

With the larger N. S. Wales electorates
the roads and bridges member was to go;
but enterprising electors, who want to work
little concessions, now see a chance to set
three or five members in competition, and the
harassed politician sees a strenuous time
ahead of him.
Australia’s champion teetotaller has just
turned up at th& Adelaide Police Court.
Giving evidence on oath, this saint said he
had never touched intoxicating liquor in his
life—except once. And then, though he was
ill, “it took 18 men to pour a nobbier down
my necK.” He didn’t explain why they
bothered. Probably he owed them money.
“Mirza”: The movies are leaving their
imprint even on conservative medicine. At
a children’s clinic in Melbourne recently the
demonstrating neurologist, having shown cer-
tain typical gaits due t£ disease, finished
with a case in which, through paralysis ol
the plantar adductors, the sufferer had “the
Charlie Chaplin walk.”
“Dreamer”: In the forties of last cen-
tury the qualifications for officers of the
English militia were: For Colonel, £lOOO a
year from landed property; lieut.-colonel,
£6OO a year from ditto; major, £4OO. Heirs-
apparent to . estates producing double those
revenues might also come in. Things like
that explain a lot in connection with that
officer-caste system which the Diggers frac-
tured in such a shameless way.
Dave Oman, Vic. Minister for Sugar
Beet, proposes to hand a bonus to beet-
growers for the crop now being carted ; and
he hopes that another bonus may be distri-
buted next year, “to stimulate production.”
Stimulation would be more certain if a
definite bonus were to be offered for next
year’s crop to attract new growers, instead
of giving the present growers the benefit of
the recent rise in sugar and leaving the mat-
ter of next year’s rate over and above the
guaranteed 30s. per ton to remain a mere
gamble.
Bent, who knew, said that the only differ-
ence between a Vic. shire and a borough
was that the mayor of a borough could wear
a cocked hat at Gov. House levies. While
he was alive he resisted any attempt to carve
up his beloved Moorabbin into boroughs, but
after he shuffled off Sandringham broke away
and was first a borough and then a town.
Now two more slices of foreshore territory,
part Moorabbin and part Dandenong, are
seeking to set up municipal housekeeping,
..and spend money on fur-lined gowns f
mayors. Mildura, where raisins and
romances are produced, has caught the same
fever.
A note from an old Parliamentary hand:
It is not difficult to get move than one instance
of caucus election of Ministers in Vic. As recently
as January, 1909, just after the general election,
when the two wings of non-Laborites came together,
one section under Murray and the other section under
Graham, they “picked” the Assembly Ministers in-
directly, if not directly. The surprise-packet was
A. A. Billson, who was more astonished than any-
body else, as he had made up his mind that he had
been rejected. In this State it was considered correct
to describe any meeting of the Ministerial, Oppo-
sition or Country party as a “caucus” up till about
15 years ago. Now an Argus man would get the
sack if he used the term except in relation to Labor.
Writers for other daily sheets pretty well follow
the same rule, though not dreading the same penalty.
“H.H.”: From report of a 40-hour-per-
week stop-work meeting : —-
Mr. J. Kilburn stated that he had received a
letter from America in which it was stated that in
the U.S. bricklayers were being paid 48s. per day
for a 44-hour week.... One job was instanced where
out of 135 bricklayers employed 50 drove to their
work in their own motors.
This statement is corroborated by two letters
I have received —one from my rich uncle in
Fiji and one from the vice-president of the
Hebrew Hod-carriers’ Association. I Suppose
it is partly because the Yankee builds his oivn
motor-cars and gets them direct from the
maker, while we make next to nothing and
pay several times the cost price. Then tri-
bute from all the world pours into Yankee-
dom for money lent, while tribute for money
borrowed pours out of Australia at such a
rate that there is little left to look forward to
except depreciated paper and the new nickel
shilling. The U.S. Dlanted money and reaps
usury. Australia planted lOU’s and reaps a
dead horse.
“0.K.”: The undertakers of this young
country are watching the question of crema-
tion with a scornful smile. In a figurative
way of speaking, it is not a burning question
at all. Nobody to speak of seems disposed!
to emulate the grass which to-day is in
the field and to-morrow i.s cast into the oven.
The crematorium at Adelaide is occasionally
—very occasionally—open for business, but
the little burning-down establishment at
Springvale (Melb.) cemetery is almost
dead, though it was opened with a flourish
of prognostications 15 years ago. The rest
of Australia has no crematoriums whatever.
We are a non-progressive race as regards
our remains. We prefer to be the same
mass of corruption that our fathers were
after death—would rather be followed to the
grave than reduced to ashes, in spite of the
general admission that interment is an un-
wholesome custom, that polished-oak coffin
purveyors are the oldest profiteers in busi-
ness, and that “floral tributes” on
one’s corpse are absurdly out of place.
All these things we know, yet we
continue to talk of “Christian burial”
as though it were an article of faith.
Notwithstanding that a local conveni-
ence is available to all, there have been
only 57 bodies cremated in Victoria in 15
years. Citizens of light and leading are
content to leave themselves to rot and rot,
in a wasteful “casket” (one of the under-
taker’s gags is to call a coffin a casket) with
gilt handles, and a metal plate on it that is
doomed to remain unread. We go on con-
fusing “earth to earth” with ashes and dust
in the burial service, as though corruption
were the father of purification, instead of a
deadly foe. Apparently there is a super-
stitious reverence for worms—arising, I
suppose, from that gruesome Scriptural insti-
tution, “the worm that never dieth.” People
must expect to worm themselves into im-
mortality. Else why should they stick to
their hereditary prejudice against cremation
and insist on committing the germs of epi-
demics to the ground, when the world might
be cleansed of them by fire?

Mrs. Catchlove Tells
How Cuticnra Healed
Rash On Little Girl
“My little girl at the age of eighteen
months had a severe cold for some
!»
time and a nasty, pimply
rash came out on her
chest and back, through
constant rubbing. She
could only sleep when
tired out and would wake
at intervals rubbing her
body and crying, but it only became
more red and little hard pimples ap-
peared scattered over her chest and
back. This went on for about a week.
“I sent for a sample of Cuticura Soap
and Ointment and used as directed.
She seemed relieved almost at once so
I procured some more which quickly
afforded relief and healed her. (Signed)

Lately an order was issued from Darwin
that the railway staff was to be reduced
to a minimum, and married men with fami-
lies were sacked, while returned single men
were kept on. Th-en just what you might
expect from the average Digger happened.
“No good to us/’ they _ said, and
promptly sent in a protest against married
men being sacked to provide them with
billets.
To still the clamor of Vic. civil servants,
who declare that the bailiffs are breaking
in, Lawson and McPherson propose to throw
them sops of anything up to £3O each, or
about £350,000 in all. They won’t be satis-
fied, but it is probably as much as the people
wail stand in a lump after providing £bbB.OUU
l'or railway hands. The real trouble is that
congestion means the doing of a vast amount
of unnecessary work, which means the main-
tenance of a vast number of superfluous
public servants.
“Centurion”: Came upon some interest-
ing information as to who won the w r ar the
other day. A Honolulu paper printed a
photo of a fat person who commanded the
American troops which “broke the Hinden-
burg line on August 28 and thus ended the
war.” In Blackwood’s, the same day, 1
found an account by a tank section com-
mander of the same stunt. He was
detailed to support Uncle Flam’s troops
with his tanks, and makes no secret of his
misgivings on his way to Tank H.Q. When
he got there he was “delighted” to find the
American staff was “being nursed by Aus-
tralian oflicers.” “We knew the Australians
and they knew us,” he says, and he went
back to his command in a state of “much
gratification.”
“S. Snell”: At Firstchop, which is in
Gippsland, Crowther, finding me rather dull
after ten days’ incarceration among the
gums, harnessed up and offered me a trip
in to the township and a treat at “the pic-
tures.” The theatre proved to be a large
enclosure fenced with slalN driven into the
soil; it was carpeted with mown grass, and
people who refused to pay were frustrated
in their hopes of a gratis entertainment by
lengths of hessian stretched above the fence.
The .films-were so tattered that every scene
seemed to he conducted in a rainstorm, but
what distressed me most was the atmosphere.
1 commented on this to Crowther, who
explained: "Oh, yes, but the management
ain’t to he blamed fer that. You see, it’s
the pig market on Wednesdays!”
Vic. Treasurer McPherson has discover d
that all sorts of people are indebted to the
State to the extent of £987,000 in the aggre-
gate, and he is going to put the screw on.
It sounds as though McPherson has struck
a forgotten treasure-chest; but he hasn’t.
First, a large amount of the debt represents
slightly overdue land-settlement arrears
which would be paid in due course, anyway.
Municipalities, whose accounts have hardly
been adjusted yet, are also behindhand to the
extent of £52,000. For the rest most of the
money is owing by bad dads whose children
are wards of State, and the £70,000 they
ought to pay but won’t has been accumulat-
ing since last century; and gold-mining cos.,
which got advances because they hadn’t a
bean, are on the books for £52,000.
“Old Contempt” : “I don’t think,” said a
wool-buyer to one of the Sydney papers, “we
thould ask our countrymen a»d the repre-
sentatives of other nations who fought side
by side with our boys to haggle with Ger-
mans over the various lots offered.” Perhaps
we shouldn’t. But personally I will rather
haggle with a German who was a patriot
than with an Englishman or an Australian
who was a shirker. When conscription
arrived in England a few English jockeys
bolted for Ireland ( the Act was never applied
to Ireland), and these slackers have been
wiped off their national turf for life. The
disqualification carries to France. But the
French have willingly opened their courses
to Austrians, some of whose cracks already
have had mounts. That gives a hint that we
might well take in a good many relations.
“Copabella” : While the central committee
of the Vic. Returned Soldiers’ League has
been busy inspiring pars, in the press about
the advantages of co-operative industries
financed by the Gratuity money and run by and
for soldiers, the Geelong branch, led by a briga-
dier who is also a fellmonger and wool-
scourer in a big way, has quietly launched
a scheme for a co-operative textile mill,
financed by 5000 Gratuity bonds of £2O
each. It is hoped there will be enough local
Gratuity money to subscribe the whole capi-
tal, and organisers are already out getting
the Digger beneficiaries to .sign off from £2O
to £lOO (the limit of holding in the co.)
before they get the bonds and the pubs get
them. About 2000 of the shares are taken
to date, applications coming in from all
over the Commonwealth. As these Diggers
don’t know anything about textiles it is
proposed to import a first-rate man and
give him a free hand. Embodied in the con-
stitution of the co. i.s a clause which gives
shareholders the right to a certain amount
of cloth a year at factory cost.
Hughes recently begged the House for
travelling exes. (£2 a day for himself and
30s. for his colleagues) : the pay. he claimed,
was far too small. At the beginning of
Federation £12,000 a year was allotted for
seven salaried Ministers, but in 1915 another
Minister was added to the pay-sheet and the
aggregate screw was raised to £13.500. In
September. 1917, the appointment of the
Itepat. Minister took the total to £15.300.
It is understood that out of that amount
Hughes draws, including his ordinary £4OO
p.a., approximately £2OOO. and each of the
other Ministers nominally £l5OO. Though
strictly an honorary Minister, the Vice-Pre-
sident of the Executive Council gets about
the same as the rest from a fund provided
by his salaried colleagues, and out of this
bag two other honoraries and three Whips
(two in the Reps, and one in the Senate)
abstract enough to bring their total earnings
into the vicinity of £lOOO a year. The
salaries are not out of the way; but the
real work that these men have to do for the
money is absurd. Compared, say. with a
N. 8. Wales State Minister, the majority
of the National Cabinet have unimportant
jobs, so restricted is the field of the National
Government’s operations.

Good Health always wins
It was easy to see who would win
Health and vigour always beat a
weakly body.
It is not brains alone that are
needed in the business world to-
day. It is the man who has health
and vigour to back them that makes
the success.
Men who neglect the minor ail-
ments such as indigestion and con-
stipation soon fall behind in life’s
race.
When the liver and bowels do
not act life is a failure —business a
worry —success out of sight.
Chamberlain’s Tablets wake these
drowsy organs like the Sun wakes
the Earth. Life is worth living—
your business a pleasure and a
success.
Don’t take medicine when it is
not needed. When medicine is
needed take the best and take it
right off.
The best medicine for indigestion,
biliousness and constipation is
Chamberlains Tablets
J&r the^Stomach o LivelL
Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
fatal to young and old. The great danger in
:his disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain's Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges the stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
and when this remedy is at hand all danger
may be avoided.
Be Firm.
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain's
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic anu
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
never fails to give immediate and permanent
relief.

Nestle’s Cooking is Cheaper & Better Cooking !
The Nestle Co. know that many women
were unable to come to the Show and enjoy a
free cooking lesson and have set aside a num-
ber of “Milky Way” Cookery Books for free

Were You at
the Sydney Show ?
Thousands of Australian women visited the spacious
Nestle’s Pavalion at the Sydney Show in order to see the
Cooks making Scones, Cakes and other dishes with the
aid of Nestle’s Condensed Milk in place of Dairy Milk.
From this valuable lesson one and all have realised
that by using Nestle’s Condensed Milk for cooking, they
can obtain better and quicker results and also reduce
the housekeeping bills considerably.
FREE!

Music—good music as Re-created by the New Edison,
brings joy and happiness into the home. It affords a
pleasant relaxation after the day s work, has a refining
and educative influence on the children, and is an
admirable means of entertaining visitors
The New Edison is the phonograph supreme. It
marvellously wakes to life again the recorded voice of
singer and harmony of instrument.
It has been tested in direct comparison with the living
artists who made the records, and the audiences were
unable to detect the difference between the real and
the Re-created.
The New Edison has no rival—no talking machine can
render such subtle inflexions of voice, delicate nuances
of tone and careful enunciation—all interpreted with
truth and feeling. It is Edison’s final achievement—it
Re-creates instead of merely imitating.
Music-lovers (who view ordinary talking machines
with disfavor) should certainly ask for details of the
New Edison. Illustrated Literature post free on request.

A National Appeal.
The Institute of Pathological Research
of New South Wales,
Under the Royal North Shore Hospital
of Sydney Act of Incorporation 1910,
is being established under the distinguished patron-
age of
HIS EXCELLENCY SIR RONALD MUNRO FERGU-
SON, P.C., G.C.M G., Governor-General of Aus-
traiia; „
Silt WALTER DAVIDSON, K.C.M.G., Governor ol
New South Wales ; '
THE HONORABLE ADRIAN KNOX, C.M.G., t hie!
Justice of the High Court of Australia.
SIR WILLIAM P. CULLEN, K.C.M.G., Chief Jus-
tice of New South Wales;
and an appeal is made for funds sufficient to erect
and maintain this National Institute, which will be
devoted solely towards solving the common but
obscure diseases occurring in Australia under Aus-
tralian conditions.
£50,000 is required at once,
with a final objective of
£150,000.
It is proposed to erect the Institute on an ideal
part of tile land of the Royal North Shore Hospital
in North Sydney, which has an available area ot
about sixteeii acres. This Hospital will be the Chief
Clinical Hospital of the Institute.
V Director, together with a staff of scientists
trained in Bacteriology, Pathology and Bio-Chemistry,
will be appointed from applicants duly advertised for,
and their work will be under the guidance of a
Scientific Advisory Council, the first Council being: —
PROFESSOR D. A. WELSH, Professor of Pathology,
Sydney University ;
DR. HENRY PRIESTLY, Assistant Professor of
Plivsiology, Sydney University;
DR. A. If. TEBBUTT, Pathologist, 211 Macquane-
street;
DR. EUSTACE FERGUSON, Acting Principal Micro-
biologist, N.S.W. -.
DR, C. H. BURTON BRADLEY, late Director of
Microbiology for Queensland.
The Institute will be managed by an; Executive
Committee appointed by the Board of Directors of
Royal North Shore Hospital of Sydney.
Much has been written and spoken about tlie
tremendous waste of child life; epidemics, both viru-
lent and mysterious, and the common but deadly
ailments such as Cancer, Consumption, Heart a,nd
other diseases, which exact such a heavy toll in
our young country upon all classes, both rich and
poor.
This Institute is founded for the purpose of investi-
gating all these diseases- —also to foster scientific
enthusiasm in medical matters and to
Give Australian Scientists an opportunity of inves-
tigating. in an Australian Institute, disease occurring
in the Southern Hemisphere.
The Honorary Treasurers: —
STR JOHN RUSSELL FRENCH, K.8.K..
General Manager, Bank New South 1\ ales,
MR. DENISON S. K. MILLER,
Governor, Commonwealth Bank,
will receive benefactions to this fund from persons,
companies or corporations desiring to assist gener-
ally. or who wish to endow foundations for research
into particular diseases.
A Research Foundation may be endowed as a
memorial to live through the years for the benefit of
humanity. _

Ross Smith had a trial run of his great
flight film in the Queen’s Hall of Federal
Parliament House last week. Standing at
a lectern, the young airman read the plain
unvarnished tale of his adventure, while the
cinema flashed the strange faces and places
the party encountered on the journey. Some-
times the machine sprayed the sheet with
the awed countenance of black brudder in
India, Burma and elsewhere, but for the
most part the film is a view of the fleeting
earth, with mountains reduced to warts and
great rivers slinking in ribbons of silver to
the toy ocean beyond. A specially notable
photo is the meeting between Ross’s 7GO-h.p.
Vimy and Poulet’s midget 'bus in Rangoon,
and there is also an excellent study of the
Javanese niggers laying a bamboo road when
Ross’s ’plane was bogged in the mud. Smith
talks crisply and unaffectedly, and casually
dismisses the biggest danger as if it wore a
slip on a banana-skin during a morning
stroll.
Uncle’s Little Widows are still offering
Rex London a Life of Turkish Delight at
Melbourne Tivoli, but the youth bolts from
the harem soon after the wedding, and finds
comfort in the society of Vera Pearce. Cer-
tainly this squad of emotional females, one
of whom is big enough to amount to a public
meeting, is sufficient to appal the boldest
heart. It is impossible to believe that even
a practised Mormon like Uncle Lloyd could
have endured the mob for long, and it is
likely that ./hen he was dying from over-
crowding he left them to his foolish nephew
in revenge.
Another alteration in the cast of “Tiger
Rose” at Melbourne King’s has removed
Reginald Goode from the part of the Tiger’s
best boy and made him the unnecessary
American visitor. In this rOle Reginald is
not an improvement on R. Bellairs, who
previously did all that was required in it.
The new hero, Frank Hatherly, is more
manly and inspiring, yet preserves the drop
of molasses in the temperament that unac-
countably appeals to the leading lady.

At Melbourne Majesty’s “Kissing Time”
is entering upon its 15th week with Zoe
Wenke in the part of Georgette St. Pol,
which Gladys Moncrieff previously adorned.
Zoe. who seemed a bit tame in “Theodore
and C 0.,” is more at home as Mrs. St. Pol,
"His Little
Widows” at
Melbourne Tivoli.
One of the brokers.
though her idea of
insouciance isn’t an
education in the way
a frivolous French
lady behaves. She
ought to take a few
lessons from Maude
Fan e. Particularly
she ought to learn how
to give a seemingly
harmless sentence a
beguiling touch of
wickedness and invita-
tion.
The T ait s have
hired Henri Ye r-
brugghen, his great
orchestra and a chorus
of 125 voices for a
Beethoven festival
commencing a t Mel-
bourne Town Hall
next Monday (10th),
and concluding on the
15th. on which date
there will be a special
matin6e performance
of the Great Choral
Symphony. Tickets
for each of the first
fi v e nights cost
from 2s. to 7s. 6d., but the top price at the
mat. will be 10s. 6d., and at the final perform-
ance will soar to a guinea.
At Melbourne Royal “Tilly of Blooms-
bury” continues to offer nothing so humor-
ous as Lady Mainwaring lorgnetting human-
ity and finding everybody diminished by the
process. It’s a great old trick of contemptu-
ous disparagement, and. though offensive to
sensitive people, it isn’t very effective on
Tilly’s relations. Grandma Banks rather
welcomes the attention, and Perc., consider-
ing himself a performing flea under a micro-
scope, does his best to make the inspection
worth while. Percy, by the way. has become
no quieter since this paper first saw him.
If anything he is working harder to keep
his voice up to the pitch of the chaste suits
and ties supplied by Megaphone and Co.

“Eastward Ho” gives a useful survey of
Noo Yark activities, from W.ld Catting to
White Slaving, with William Ilussell as prin-
cipal guide. The story dips occasionally into
the underworld, but it sk ps back to rosy
daylight when William and a girl book a
date for the altar. Lila Lee, in “The Heart
of Youth,” is the other Hoyt feature in Mel-
bourne. and only a fizzy summer drink is
comparable to Lila in this dancing tale of
girlish affection. At the Majestic, “One
Hour,” the alleged sequel to Elinor Glyn’s
“Three Weeks,” would hardly teach the
devilish how to reach the Divorce Court. The
story is full of snow, dullness and respect-
ability and might be published as a text-book
for a theological college. "A Gentleman
Rider,” by an English company, will make
a strong appeal to the movie fancier. The
yarn concerns a girl with a string of race-
horses who has a romantic Australian jock
to make . the string effective. At. the
Princess’s various uncensored war films are
reproducing some big moments in the battles
with the Ilun and Turk, and Generals Mon-
ash, Chauvel and other officers talk about
them. Saturday was a big vice-regal night,

tory, 3918.” At the Athenaeum W. J. Shep-
hard brings the Prince before you in a
kinemacolor view of his investiture in Wales.
Featured in the rest of the kinemacolored
programme are some aspects of the restless
Rotorua landscape visited by Edward the
other day. Also there is a gorgeous study
of his dad’s coronation at Delhi, which makes
a jam label look like a wet day by Corot.
“The Passing Show of 1020” is due to
leave Sydney soon. All but the blind have
seen it and many of those who still have
their eyesight have paid tribute more than
once at the door of Her Majesty’s. Some
assert that it is more of a habit than a revue.
It’s all up with “Tails Up” on Friday.
Beginning with the Saturday matinge. Syd-
ney Tivoli will start to earn its bread and
electricity with “Oddments.”
“Mademoiselle Mimi” is aged six weeks
at the Playhouse (next to Sydney’s Head
Fire Station). But, magnificent as her past
is, she still has some future left.
The J.C.W. Digger Pierrots rattle away at
the Royal, and enough of Sydnev turns up
every evening to keep the Maorilanders
cheerful. Garter, the magician, is due to open
at this house on Saturday, May 15.
“The Sleeping Beauty” panto, is still
pursuing the profitable tenor of its way at
Sydney Criterion. The idea of contending
in a knockabout comedy tourney with the
N. S. Wales Assembly has been dropped.
It is felt in the profession that, with Danny
Levy in the chair and J. C. L. Fitzpatrick
unfettered by any censor, the legislators have
an undue advantage.
“Mother Hubbard” at the Palace keeps
on pulling Sydney’s leg about there being
nothing in the cupboard. The booking proves
that the red-nosed old dame must have
enough stowed away by this time to buy out
three butchers’ shops.
Sydney Haymarket and Globe show how
Catherine Bush, Elinor Glyn’s heroine, hav-
ing counted the cost several times, determined
to purchase social
tone at the expense
of a week-end. On
this trip she learns
the use of an
oyster for k, and
thereupon is armed
to become private

bagetin. F r o in

The Dog and Monkey Circus, now cheer-
ing the last nights of Wirths’ big show at
the Hippodrome, is full of good humor and
should drag a large proportion of Sydney
back for a second look before the elephants
pack their trunks and move out on the trail
that is always new.
From an Adelaide critic: —
A new Gwen Barringer is disclosed in the latest
show of the lady’s paintings in the Society of Arts
gallery. She has developed power which formerly
was lacking. The change seems to have been
wrought by a long visit to Sydney. The pretty
flower-garden studies, the gum-trees in the manner
of Hans Heysen, are still there; but mingled with
them are impressions of the Harbor in many aspects.
And though she has her old weakness of unfinished
foregrounds, the show is full of pleasure and red
labels.
The main feature of the “On Our Selec-
tion” revival at Adelaide Tivoli is the new
casting. Duggan moves up from the Irish
support into Bailey’s patented part of Dad,
Tom Cannan is now the Irishman, and
Leslie Gordon is in the boots that Fred
Macdonald wore so splendidly. Without
making comparisons, it is still a satisfac-
tory show. Dad become Grand-dad is to
follow. The Majestic has good music from
Bloy on the banjo, and the diggers Laurie
and Rossie give a good turn. Murfayne
hammers the. xylophone to popular approval.
But the show wants strengthening on the
athletic side. Emelie Polini is starting at
the Royal, which meanwhile has been show-
ing interesting Melbourne films, with an
unkind insistence on the slum aspect—
doubtless intended as an appeal to Adelaide,
which claims to have no slums at all. Snowy
Baker’s “Man from Kangaroo” is at West’s
and doing big business. The Wondergraph
Co. has a lot on its hands, with a round
of suburban houses all planned out and a
new dance palace on North Terrace. Its
central house now shows that grim story
of revenge, “Behind the Door.” with the far-
cical “What’s Your Husband Doing?” The
Pav. has a strong combination, Sessue Hay-
akawa with Harold Lockwood.
** * *
Adelaide is very proud of pianist Maude
Puddy, who studied under Reimann at the
Gonservatorium, had some years in Europe,
first as a pupil of Leschetizky and after-
wards giving concerts to wounded Diggers,
and now is back doing Reimann’s work while
he visits England. Her first recital, at the
Town Hall, shows her a versatile master
of the instrument, and absolutely free from
platform tricks. She wandered from Schu-
mann’s “Butterflies” to Brahms, with Chopin
ai/d several things of Leschetizky—who has
dedicated one to her. The flowers showered
on her tended to block the platform and
stop the recital; but they were well in-
tended.
"Owen M.”: A wire-whiskered cocky,
giving evidence at a recent X. S. Wale's Land
Board inquiry, was asked how many child-
ren he had. “Five,” he replied, “and if
I get this piece of land there’ll be half a
dozen more.” Application confirmed.
"Stargazer”: Of all the actors I have met
■D had the most mobile face. He had
been playing character parts for 35 years,
and had his features in so plastic a state
that it seemed to me at times he must ex-
perience difficulty in keeping them from run-
ning. With a twist of the muscles he could
shift any or all his features, and become
practically another man. On one occasion
he went into a Swanston-street fishmonger’s,
when it was the custom to take your oysters
standing at a small counter at the back of
the shop, and ordered a large plate. He was
wearing a cap called a viator, capable of
being altered at will; this he had taken off,
and was holding between his body and the
counter. lie got his oysters, replaced the
cap in another shape, took a pull at his face,
and shifted a pace or two along. The man
opening the oysters looked up for the cash,
ran an eye along the customers, gave a
shout, and Hed to the door. “What’s the
matter, Bill?” demanded a companion. Bill
was now looking up and down the street, lie
came in. “Well, me,” he said, “that
was a smart bit 6f work if you like. That
blanker with the long nose got clean away
without paying for his oysters!”
“Manawatu”: Foxton is an ancient
MX. settlement, dwarfed in infancy, but
famous for its flax, fires and fleas. During
one of its periodical fires tin* school was
destroyed, and with it a piano. The Educa-
tion Department rebuilt the school, but the
people had to replace the piano. They raised
the money and set out in search of an
instrument. A departing widow, with tears
in her eyes, offered to sell them her
cherished instrument, dead cheap at £45.
Suddenly there arose a fearsome patriot who
discovered that it was a Herman piano! He
declared that it would choke him to sing
“God Save the King” to the accompani-
ment of a Him instrument. The contagion
•spread until the town was split in two—the
loyalists and the mercenaries. Foxton
school is under the direct authority of the
Wanganui Education Board, and long
letters and windy deputations appealed to
it to prevent an outrage. The chairman of
the Board, a fiery’ex-politician, raising his
voice until it trembled with patriotic fervor,
declared: “I would rather see 10 thousand
indecent pictures in the school than one
German piano !’ So the loyalists won. The
widow’s German piano was cast into outer
darkness, and the children have for some
time raised their voices in “God Save” to
the accompaniment of a piano branded “Wil-
liam Raymond, London,” which cost £D<>, the
other £45 being found by the Board as an
earnest of its practical patriotism. But now
a piano-tuner has been called in to adjust
the grand old British institution, and he has
found stamped on every piece of its innards
“J. Koehler, Berlin.”
“II.O.” on the “art” of picture-making:—
I heartily endorse the disparaging remarks of
“0.K.” (15/4/’2O) anent the alleged “art” of film-
acting. Any moderately intelligent show-girl could
be taught in a few months to perform the tricks that
make up the “art” of most of the loudly-boomed
screen heroines (especially those of the “vampire”
class), though years of training might fail to convert
her into even a passable actress. A man who has had
experience both as a “legitimate” actor and a film-
producer, speaking of posing for the films, once
told me: “It isn’t acting; but only an actor can
do it.” A screen scenario looks like the specifica-
tions for a big building contract. Practically no-
thing is left to the imagination of the performer;
every movement is described in detail, and the
models (billed as “actors”) have merely to move
about, sit down, stand up, light see-gars and so
forth according to instructions. The main considera-
tion is to keep within range of the camera, and
this is where people who have spent years in con-
fining their movements to the spotlight have an
advantage. If a performer comes too close to the
machine the director may bark an order for him to
go back three paces; the trained actor will obey
automatically, with an appearance more or less of
naturalness, whereas the novice would probably look
round to ascertain what the fuss was about, and
make a mess of some feet of film. Looked at from
the front, the “art” of screen-acting seems to con-
sist mostly of the performance of ordinary actions
as slowly and methodically as possible, and some
idea of how comparatively easy the job is may
be gained by watching an ordinary flapper imitating
one of her screen idols. True, the flapper makes
herself supremely ridiculous, but not much more so
than does the professional actress who insists upon
going through her stage tricks outside the theatre,
and if the flapper’s movements were photographed
and fitted into a story they would be found to be
not very different from those of the expensive lady
she imitates.

Alkali Causes Soap
To Injure Hair.
Nearly all soaps and ready-mixed shampoos
—even the most expensive—contain too much
alkali, which is dangerous, as it dries the
scalp and makes the hair brittle.
Really the most elegant and safe thing to
use is ordinary colinated cocoanut oil (a pure,
saponified but quite greaseless liquid), which
is not at all expensive—but is far, far better
than soaps or other scalp-injurious things.
Every chemist keeps a supply of this, and a
few ounces lasts you and mother, sisters and
brothers for mouths. Just wet the hair with
water and rub it through—thoroughly. One
or two teaspoonfuls is plenty to create a big
quantity of rich, heavy, creamy lather. It
cleanses delightfully and rinses out easily.
The hair dries, quickly and easily, and comes
out brilliant, soft, fluffy, wavy and fresh as a
daisy, looking much thicker than it actually
is.
Best of all. this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress agaiu as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. And yet
tt loosens and carries off every bit of excess j
oxliness, dust, dirt or dandruff scurf.
IMPORTANT. —Do not confuse colinated cocoanut
oil with cheaper sticky, emulsified cocoanut oils
or other substitutes. There is only one genuine
colinated cocoanut oil, as recommended above.
Girls! Women! Give this a Corner on your Dressing-
table. Never Let a Corn Ache Again!
Like a Flash! Few Drops Stop Corns Throbbing,
Then Corns and Callouses Wither Up, Loosen
and Lift Out Like a Cork—Painlessly!
-
THE Australian people owe a
debt of gratitude to the wizard
in chemistry who formulated the
new ether discovery named
Erozol-Ice.
Little phials of this
wonder liquid are now
obtainable from any chem-
ist for a few pence. You
* merely apply a few drops
of tlals Frozol-Ice on a ten-
der. aehlDg corn or tough-
ened callous. Right away all
soreness vanishes, and soon you see the
corn or callous that loose and withered
that it lifts out, with the fingers, like a
cork. Not a twinge of pain or even irritation
is felt when using Frozol-Ice, or afterwards.
No soreness, no inflammation of surrounding
healthy flesh or skin.
Only a few pence now gives one freedom
from ail and each soft. corn, hard corn, corn
between the toes, likewise tender callouses on
bottom of the feet. Every Australian who
tries Frozol-Ice sings its praises, for it
honestly does not hurt one wee bit.
Step in at your chemist's to-night and in-
sist on having a small phial of Frozol-Ice,
in the green-printed carton. Stand on “vour
dig." and refuse spurious imitations of this
great composed.
Easy Way to Get
Rid of Indigestion.
Although you may have indigestion so
severely that, anything but t lie simplest of
foods cause you the keenest suffering, there
is a simple way to get back safely to pleas-
anter. more nourishing foods. Just take a
teaspoonful of pure Salix Magnesia in a little
hot or cold water with eacu meal, and begin
at once to eat a little of any food you crave.
Salix Magnesia, which comes in the form of
powder or tablets (never as a liquid or coarse
granules) is not a laxative, but neutralises
the excess acid in the stomach, and so prevents
or stops all the pain of indigestion. Its use
eannot, like pepsin, soda-water, etc., do the
stomach any injury, and it will soon enable
you to eat good, hearty, satisfying meals of
the foods you like best without fear of bad
results. Your chemist should be able to sup-
ply you with Salix Magnesia.

“75”: In his list (R 29/4/’2O) of actresses
of the G. V. Brooke era who are still alive,
“T. 0.1.” includes the name of one t Mrs.
Arrowsmith, stage name Henrietta Montrose)
who answered the call at Melbourne early
in April, and omits that of Fannie Wiseman,
who is 74, living in Melbourne, and who
recently, made an appearance in revue. Mrs.
Arrowsmith was the mother of Mrs. Ran-
dolph Bedford, whose stage name was Polly
Arrowsmith ; of Teddy Ryan, for many years
a comedian with Bland Ilolt; and of the late
William Arrowsmith, a Shnkspearean mum-
mer who left Australia for the U.S. with the
Genevieve Ward co. Fanny Wiseman was a
contemporary of this lady’s under Johnnie
Hall in Maoriland and on the Ballarat gold-
fields, and later was a member of Brooke’s
Australian co. She has also supported
George Coppin, William Hosking. William
Creswick, Dion Boucicault and Mrs. Scott
Siddons. She came this way with her parents
in 1854. made her first stage appearance in
pantomime at the age of five, and was the
original Topsy here in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”
She has done the State the greater service
of becoming the mother of 14 good Austra-
lians.
“Norbell”: Canon E. S. Hughes, of St.
Peter’s, Melbourne, who has been offered the
gaiters at Rockhampton (Q.), is a friend of
Poverty Point’s. When Tyrone Power was
playing at the Princess’s 20 years ago he
used to read the lessons at St. Peter’s every
Sunday. Power is a fine, big man, like
Hughes, and he wore Canon Hughes’s cas-
sock and biretta in “The Charity Ball,” a
Belasco play.
“S.S.”: It does not follow that a success-
ful play will make a successful or satisfac-
tory film drama. Take “Struck Oil,” for
instance. After drawing money from the
Australian public for well over 40 years, it
was recently reproduced in pictorial form,
with Maggie Moore in the part she made so
much of when a slip of a girl, and Harry
Roberts and Stofel. I think it came close
to being the worst screen play it has been
my hard lot to witness. In the first place,
“Struck Oil” was largely an oral triumph
with its plenteous singing, Williamson’s
efforts with the mouth-organ (which instru-
ment he induced people to take seriously),
and the quaint patter of the Dutch father
and daughter. Judged as a thing to be seen,
with the Dutch daughter about 20 sizes too
large, and John Stofel looking like an amor-
phous bundle because of a slim actor’s need
to build a false front to himself in order to
fill the requirements of the part, “Struck
Oil” was a lamentable error from the audi-
torium, whatever shape it assumed in the
box-office.
“Glen Huntly” : If the Fullers have any
sense of humor they must be smiling at the
unofficial censorship of one of their harmless,
unnecessary productions instituted by Mel-
bourne dailies. They advertised the forth-
coming production, at the Palace, of “The
Unmarried Mother,” but soon the title of the
show disappeared from the chaste advertising
columns—except that for one day the Age,
greatly daring, gave it as “T U M” —and it
was merely announced that “a new American
drama” would be staged. When it came to
pass it proved to be the customary innocuous
brand of Fuller play, with a .betrayed gyurl
as heroine, of a kind that the righteous press
has made the subject of a hundred puff pars
in the past. Only one of the three dailies
published a notice of the production, and,
although no word of condemnation was
uttered, the shocking title was suppressed.
And all the time the papers are advertising
and praising a play staged by the same man-
agement at the Princess’s, the heroine of
which is an unmarried prospective mother
who endeavors to arrange with the hero (.a
doctor) to get rid of the unwanted infant,
the possibilities of an abortion being dis-
cussed on the stage. Compared with this
“The Unmarried Mother” is milk for babes,
but the author of the Princess’s show was
careful to choose a title ("The Natural
Law”) not calculated to shock the suscepti-
bilities of the high-souled.
“Smike”: Arthur Wontner, now described
as "one of the greatest intellectual actors in
England,” failed to impress the late Jimmy
Williamson when he came to Australia, and
in one play was put aside for the rather
pappy Plimmer. Wontner’s friends were in-
censed, but he refused to concern himself so
long as his salary was coming along.
“Besides.” he said, as if in afterthought, "let
Williamson take his gruel, though he will
certainly get it thin in Plimmer.” Harry, good
in some parts, was a failure in this, and the
keen and incisive Englishman was restored
to grace and achieved a wide popularity.
During his term in the Commonwealth; he
married the beauteous Rose Pendennis.
“Norbell”: This “Humanity” bellowdra-
mette, in which John Lawson breaks up the
happy home, and which depends for its
punch on reducing the house and furniture
to brie-A-brae. its it were, is not new to
Sydney. Few theatrical novelties are.
"Humanity” was done coniine on at Clay’s
Bridge Theatre, Newtown, about seven years
ago. Much crockery was smashed, but no
records, 1 think. I forget who did the
destructive Jew, but Rob Inman was the
other- fellow, and his daughter was the
hero whine.
'“Prompt”: It isn’t often that the theatre-
goer in Perth can put out his tongue and cry
to Sydney and Melbourne, “Yah, we seen it
first!” But he will be able to say it of “Yes,
Uncle.” to be given its glittering chance here
in a few days time. And as it is just upon
seven years since the plotless modern substi-
tutes for comic opera shook the Perth bald-
heads out of their bachelor nooks, the Firm
looks like leaving something substantial with
the W.A. tax collector.

“Glen Huntley” :
An attempt to catry
the “unwritten
law” to the giddy
limit is made by
the Yankee author
of “Tiger Rose.”
A man is shot dead
“off-stage” by the
hero, and through
three acts the audi-
ence is expected to
sympathise with
the young man on
the ground .that de-
ceased was a dirty
dog who had done
his slayer an in-
tolerable wrong.
Toward the end of
the show the
nature of the said
wrong is revealed
—the dead man
bdd been guilty of
giddiness with the
hero’s auntie! One
of these nights I
expect an Amur-
can dramatist to
invoke the “un-
written law” on
behalf of an heroic
youth who has
thrown the seducer
of his brother-in-law's second cousin into a
vat of boiling oil.
“Old Pot”: I fancy the use of “J. Rosier”
in the bills when a double is played pre-
ceded the arrival in Australia of that fine
actress Marie de Grey. She came to Aus-
tralia in 1884 with her own company, which
included such top-sawyers as Mark King-
horn and the incomparable Mrs. Chippendale.
Marie de Grey is the best Lady Teazle I
have seen in Australia —and Cyril Maude is
the worst Sir Peter. The Sydney
girl Dorothy Camming, who supported
Maude as the young wife in the
Screen scene in Sydney, showed the most
promise of all since Nance O'Neil’s day.
She was, however, shockingly treated by
some of the critics, who came to laud Sir
Peter, and, though finding in him a
“Grumpy,” faithfully carried out their
original intention. Marie de Grey was a
provincial star. I saw her at Aberdeen (Scot-
land) on a ’Varsity students’ night, and the
dignified manner in which she silenced the
graceless yahoos still lives in ray memory.
The Argus raises the curtain and disil-
lusionises the credulous:—
To-morrow... .the first judging will take place of
the Victorian competitors in the beauty contest....
Applicants who have not yet completed their forms
should obtain them to-morrow morning from the
manager of the theatre.
Of course anything in that way might be
suspected of seasoned actresses; but to sug-
gest it of damsels who are supposed to be so
bewitching that they are to get a tenner a
week for six months for their mere beauty is
too bad.
At the Court Theatre, London, laughs are
being got by a device which would hardly
have gone uncensored a few years back. “The
Little Visiters,” the absurd story by little
Daisy Ashford (since grown up), which most
people have persisted in crediting to J. M.
Barrie, has been dramatised as a kind of bur-
lesque. And in the Buckingham Palace scene
the late King Edward (as Prince of Wales)
and Lord Salisbury are imitated just as
closely as the art of Clarkson, the wig-maker,
can do it.
When all the hotels of Adelaide, good, bad
or indifferent, were before the Licensing

Millet, a charming if not very dis-
tinguished actress, tier father was an Indian
officer, and she married another, disappear-
ing from the stage for years between her first
appearance long ago as a pretty flapper in

Tree and then Penley) to her last in Barrie’s

“M.F.A.”: Recent P.P. pars about Flora
Graupner recall that she played Princess Iris,
the Daimio’s daughter, in the Williamson and
Musgrove production of “D.iin Djin” in 189(5.
The book, a fairy tale of old Japan, was by
Bert Royle and J.C.W. himself. The music
came from the prolific pen of “Daddy” Caron,
with additional numbers by Geo. Pack. The
cast included John Coleman as the dame (the.
Daimio’s elderly maiden sister). Billy Elton
(Tom Wallaby) and Edward Farley in the
name part. Among the girls were Flo Young
(principal boy), Carrie Moore (Prince
Omi), Ivy Scott (Cheeke), Leonore O'Relli
(Fairy Queen) and Mary Weir (principal
dancer). The specialties embraced Billy
Williams’s four youngsters on their bikes,
the Banvard acrobats and Dora Enright on
an electric bicycle. The costumes were de-

“J.B\H.”: Queenslander William Archer,
dramatic critic of the London Star, has had
a little difference with the Phoenix Society.
The mission of this body is to revive and
reproduce old-time English plays. Its latest
efforts have been concerned with the spicy,
not to say smutty, works of the Restoration
dramatists—a period when England in
general and Lon-
don in particular
were enjoying a
violent reaction
after Puritan
rigors and restric-
tions. Archer, as
might have been
expected from a
highly moral native
o f Rockhampton,
objected to the
naked and unvar-
nished “licentious-
ness” of these Res-
toration plays, and
told the Phoenix
Society it ought
to be ashamed of
itself, or words to
that effect. T h e

The Queenslander retorted by returning the
ticket leaving the performance without a
word in the Star.
“Norbell” : Harry Hudson, for years past
storming through the Backbloeks with Philip
Lytton’s tent gorodramas, has had a long run
in Australia. Ages ago he was a heavy-
weight operatic artist, and since then he has
been with most of the leading dramatic
shows. He was one of George Rignold’s
solid men, and after the Big Chief relin-
quished Sydney Majesty’s llodson was the
lessee for a while. But lie was less success-
ful as manager than as actor.
“C. Ockney”: An interesting revival of
“La. Tosca” in England recently brought
Ethel Irving forward in the star part. A
fresh version of Sardou’s thriller was pre-
pared for the occasion, and new incidental
music was composed by Australia's old baton-
waving friend Howard Carr. The Baron
Scarpia was Jerrold Robertshaw. remem-
bered here as Mephistopheles and in the
Matheson Lang productions of “Pete” and
“Third Floor Back.”
“Glen II.”: After a very brief renewed
association with London Gaiety, as adviser-
in-chief to Sralfred Butt. Seymour Hicks
and his wife, Ellaline Terris, are leaving the
profesh of which they have been members
for 34 years. Hicks announces that he is
“going into the banking business and taking
up politics,” the first of these stirring events
being billed for this month. When the mail
left he was due to make his last (probably
an actor’s “last”) appearance in the spot-
light at the Golders Green Hippodrome in
“After the Honeymoon.”
“T. D. Emdee”: “Princess Ida” was first
produced by W., G. and M. in the middle
’eighties. The infrequency of revivals since
is a sufficient reply to a claim by “Mid-
Channel” or anyone else that this opera was
a success in Australia, Bad casting does
usually mar any kind of, play, but there are
plays, musical and otherwise, that even that
factor cannot ruin. “The Gondoliers” was
one of the G. and S. sucesse.s everywhere but
in America. When first produced there it
was styled “The Gone Dollars.” Comment
is unnecessary.
“Rangan”: “Bromide’s” yarn (B.
26/2/’2O) of the bullet near the Digger's
heart throbbing on the X-ray screen
reminds me of one of the most imposing side-
show fakes that ever wafted into Australia.
In a semi-darkened tent a plump damsel,
sufficiently unclad to rivet attention, reclined
on a pedestal while a lantern-operator threw
a limelight ray on to her, and at the same
time projected on to a screen a slide of a
skeleton recumbent. He was allegedly
X-raying the lady to the gaping crowd, and
the effect was remarkably convincing. For
fear that some yob might ask to see the
thing move, the lantern-man previously
warned the audience that the slightest quiver
on the lady’s part might cause death.
STATUS QUO ANTE BELLAMY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Paul Bellamy came to our lodgings one day,
And proved a disquieting factor,
For the daughter Jemima, so handsome and gay,
At once fell in love with the actor.
This Paul he was tall and most beauteous he,
Like the Prince in the popular fable;
We found all the warmth of our dinner and tea
Flowed at once to his end of the table.
We scoffed at his fame, and we dubbed him an ass,
And we took her to see him performing,
For it seemed that must put her right off him. Alas!
She rejoiced at his ranting and storming.
But there came unexpected to visit the pro.—
Inspired, as I doubt not, by Heaven—
Paul’s dear little children. They stood in a row.
They were all that he had. They were seven.
Now our end of the table’s the top, and if there’s
A roast chicken we head the procession.
He had sworn all he owned in the world should be
The kids were his only possession!
But Jemima confesses that what made her mad
Was a murmur from one of the brothers.
“You’re all right,” he remarked; “still I wish that
our dad
Wasn’t alwiz a-ehangin’ our mothers!”

NOTIONS
"ON TOP" WITH
MICH SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
The opening day of Melbourne’s League
football provided several surprises and a shock.
The shock was sustained by last year’s premiers,
’Wood, who collided with Essendon, and had all
their old battlers playing. But for the last month
’Don, like certain other teams, perceiving that this
promises to be a record season, have been training
hard, and condition stood to the lted-and-Blacks, so
that at the finish they ran over the mighty Magpies,
with a total! of 54 points to 36. The Richmond lot,
last season’s'surprise packet, have also been training
hard and started off well, with fast, concerted play/
beating ’Roy by 79 points to 59. ’Roy’s trainer
would appear to have been a catch-as-catch-can
wrestler, and it should be explained to him and his
students that the neck-hold is not recommended in
hoofball, at least with a wideawake umpire. Carlton
walloped the Saints without unduly straining them-
selves —70 points to 41. The surprise of the day,
and the best game, came to the smallest crowd of
onlookers, at the M.C. Ground, where the valiant
Souths, playing the best of their last season’s men,
crashed’befdre Melbourne, which last season had an
unbroken series of defeats. But last season the Red
Legs were a war-wrecked team ; now they have got
back big Brake and Odgers, and have snared a few
stars from Ballarat, Brunswick and elsewhere, and,
being trained to the hour, they beat South in style—
-67 points to 55.
* * * *
Sydney ! Rugby League first-grade com-
petition opened on Saturday with a 9 points to 7
defeat Of Easts by last year’s premiers. Some of
the causes were (1) the failure of Easts’ backs in
the first half, (2) the spoiling tactics of Snowy
Latta, and ;(3) a ball which was too lively for
Messenger. ‘ Both packs got hold well and quickly
from the scrums ; but the Balmain backs made better
use of their opportunities afterwards. Chook Frazer
handled and kicked well. Balmain’s threequarters
were nippy and sure, and the running round and
backing up [of Conaghan and Potter and the heady
play of Robinson and Craig were fine. Easts’ three-
quarters were outplayed until Cupitt went to out-
side centre in the second half. An exhibition which
earned a hearty count-out from the crowd was a
hacking bout indulged in by the opposing full backs.
The duel Continued with 24 plavers looking on
until the leather went out of bounds. Caples, East’s
five-eighth, was the star of his side; he made
many openings which would have resulted in scores
if Messenger’s form had been better. The' latter,
by the way, should cut out the practice of trying
to horn his opponents. Ray Norman and Sandy
Pearce were both guilty of illegal interference; and
one of Pearce's efforts resulted in two points being
notched by Balmain from the penalty. Challis’s
field-goal was a dandy. He propped just outside
Balmain's 25; let fly, and the leather, travelling
low, struck the cross-bar and skidded through.
Newtown and North Sydney also waged a great
fight, and although Norths led by 10-9 at half-
time Newtown were ahead at tne no-side whistle by
17-15. Newtown scored five tries and one goal
against North’s three tries and three goals, the
latter the work of J. Ward. In the other matches
Wests outclassed Souths bv 21-5, and Glebe over-
whelmed Anrtandale by 43-6. F. Burge kicked eight
goals for Glebe.
Sydney Union Rugby season opened on
Saturday in summer weather and with many of
the players short of a gallop. Manly and Mosman
played a fluctuating game, in which the forwards
of both teams were brilliant. The villagers emerged
five points to the good. Mingay fed his backs well,
and for the Zooites Hodgins was very nippy.
Although Glebe-Balmain have a useful team on paper
and are superior to ’Varsity on a man-to-man basis,
they lacked combination. The students accordingly
licked them by 24—3. The G.B. backs were mostly
on the defensive. Mayne was brilliant if a bit sel-
fish ; and for ’Varsity Lawton and Wallace were
foremost among an enterprising and very keen 15.
It is a pity North can’t, in common with other
suburbs, draw from the G.P. Schools. It would
both improve their standard of play and add to the
school-boys’ interest in the game. The thing might
be managed if inter-school matches weren’t played
on Saturdays. Wests had a margin of 32 points
over them when the whistle blew. Norths were
weak in tackling and on most occasions West’s
players scored by brute strength. Wogan and Cham-
pion shone for the victors. Newtowns usually put
a fair team in the field. They didn’t on Saturday,
however, and Easts helped themselves to 33 points.
Newtown, patently out of practice, could only re-
spond with eight. Walker and Brown showed most
effulgence for Easts.
Under Australian rules, Newtown de-
feated Sydney after a great go by 39 points to 37.
Paddington showed pace and judgment in winning
from Balmain bv 34-16; and East Sydney out-
classed Railway by 61-13.
The Football League of Adelaide lias l
dealt a heavy blow' at the District system, by ruling
that it need not apply after a man has played for his
proper district for five years ; after that he may go
on playing with his old team if he prefers it, even
though he has gone to live elsewhere. The idea is
to avoid breaking up old friendships ; also, possibly,
to assist the clubs of the city proper, which is
losing population. Traders do not live over their
shops as they used to, and many old homes have
made way for warehouses and factories, to the steadv
gain of suburban districts. Probably, in the end, the
city may have to amalgamate into a single club, while
the populous suburbs split up. A step in the latter
direction has been taken this season, the enormous
electoral area of Sturt having agreed to let Glenelg
and Brighton break away to form a new League club.
( The football drama has come at last. In
rhe Game,” by Harold Brighouse, of Lancashire,
the hero is the best centre-forward in England, and
the villain the manager of the local soccer club, who
transfers him to a rival club, on the eve of a big
match, for a secret payment of £3OOO ; all of which
except the secrecy, is quite possible in English pro-
fessional circles. Add that the hero is engaged to
the villain’s daughter, and you have a stirring play,
with football as the main theme; neither burlesque
nor melodrama, but a study of character in the
Lancashire manner. It hns been performed once or
twice, and is now published in a volume of Brio-
house plays. “

With the Federal people debarred from
taxing tote investments, the S.A. State Government
is thinking, of taking a further wad out of the machine.
At present the clubs grab 74 p.c. and the State 5 pc
—the Government increased its bite from 24 to 5 p.c.
on December 20, 1915. Before long it is anticipated
the State-will require 74 p.c. In S. Aus. the book-
maker is .a prohibited bird; but the illicit McShort-
odds will do increased business if the authorities are
too gireedy.

Last week Tetratema. the wonderful grey
Tetrarch colt, took the Two Thousand Guineas, which
is the first big race of the English flat-race season.
He is already a hot favorite for the Derby; while
Silvern, who somehow beat him at Newbury (that
being the only time he was ever headed), is at an
outside price.
* * # *
The Shorts Handicap at the Q.T C. meet-
ing on May Day provided a very open race. The
consistent Sheila R., the favorite, was not able to
concede Ercanil 121 b. It was only by vigorous push-
ing on O’Neill’s part that she scraped into second
place in front of the outsider Royaline. The Handi-
cap saw another short-priced favorite in Rita R.
unplaced in a field of nine: Tmpeyan and Noelmayne
winning from the imported Levcrrier.

Perth Trotting Club had its most success-
ful meeting this Easter: the £5OO Cup brought a
record crowd. The star performer was Kola Girl a
Maoriland-bred mare, by Galindo from Kola Nut.
Ridden by her owner, T. Foy, she won the final after
a great race, beating John Redmond by a head. In
the Easter Handicap, two miles, Kola Girl again
performed brilliantly, although she was conceding
a dozen others up to 170yds. ; but owing to interfer-
ence she lost ground in the last lap and finished
third. Her mile rate was 2min. 19$sec., the fastest
recorded in W. Aus. over the distance. In 1918 the
same Girl won the W.A. Trotting Cup, so she has
maintained her form well.
\isitors to the Deloraine (Tas.) Easter
meeting reckon they saw a V.R.C. National Hurdle-
winner in Kilowatt, winner of the 24 miles hurdles.
This horse, a five-year-old gelding by Martian faom
Forked Lightning, was bred in M.L. He chopped
4_sec. off the previous-best time for the “Tasmanian
National Hurdle.” On the following Saturday, at
Launceston, he won a two-mile hurdle in the mud
in 3min 454 sec. with lOst. 41b. on his back. As at
Deloraine he ran the second mile faster than the first,
and finished as if he could run a third faster
still. He was snapped up by T. Bray, a vie. owner,
and is now being trained at Caulfield.
For the racing year ending March 31,
1921, Moonee Valley Racing Club is to have 12
meetings instead of the nine allowed last year.
Other clubs in the Vic. metropolitan area are to
have the same number of days as in the year just
closed. So the Cabinet has decreed. April 1 starts
tiie racing year—which may or may not be an official
gibe at mugs.
A peculiar record has been established by
a South Aus. brood mare, Queen Consort 11. At the
Gawler races on April 24 she was represented by two
mares each four years old, but by different sires.
This cleverness is explained by the fact that one of
her daughters (Delvigne by Pistol) was foaled on
•July 31, and on August 1. when only a day old, she
had to rank as a one-year-old.

Macario. the Filipino who engaged Digger
Evans at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night, is a
much hettier proposition than his fellow countryman
Jumito. In fact, he met the soldier as a light-
weight. » Like his incapacitated friend, he favors
what may be termed the Jungle school of boxing.
He has a right swing whieh begins about half a foot
from the ground and goes whistling upwards in a
circular direction. It has a formidable appearance;
but it seldom if ever lands. Either the Digger does
not pack a genuine knock-out punch in his civilian
outfit or else Macario has a jaw comparable to that of
the Dago wonder Joe Grimm. Evans banged his
leaden-hued opponent on almost every angle of the
chin, but its owner proceeded as though he had
noticed nothing in particular. From the stage when
it became evident to everybody—including the com-
batants—that Evans couldn’t hurt Macario while
Macario couldn’t hit Evans, interest in the struggle
waned. At the finish the soldier had won about 18
of the 20 rounds on points, and the decision was
given accordingly.

' It is one of the curiosities of the boxing
business that Sid Godfrey, who outed Digger Evans
m such s.iort order last month, should not since
have been given a show. Nor is his reappearance
foreshadowed He is said to suffer under a queer
disability—that of being too good. His knock-out
punch—the one with which he felled Evans—is so
terrific that the most promising of bouts is alwavs
liable to be ended in a round or two, and the
most popular “drawing card” is in constant danger
of having his value depreciated—as happened in
the case of the Digger. Green is about, the onlv
boy m Godfrey’s class who can take him on with
reasonable safety: he has an adequate guard for
tile palhd-faced destroyer’s awful right. But the
Stavlmm management can’t keep on staging Green-
Godfrey bouts, and so the best man at his weight
m Australia remains in unprofitable seclusion.

Breast-stroke swimming-champion C.
Atkinson (M.L.) upset an ancient record the other
day by traversing 100yds. in 77 l-ssec. This is
1 l-ssec. better than his 1915 effort at Napier.
At the N.S.W. National Coursing Asso-
ciation meeting at Rooty Hill last week, the Derby
went to Concrete, a hundred to three chance. At card-
call Barrage (one of Bennett’s noms.) was made
iavonte, being backed down to 5 to 1. Next came
Achieved’s Image at six to one, with Black Alf, a
Beauty Spot puppy, a point further away. Con-
crete outed the favorite in the first ties. A course
oi two previously had seen Achieved’s Image removed
from the slate by Black Alf. The rank outsider
ended a triumphant series of oourses by well licking
AJf. In the Oaks the first and second favorites sur-
vived to fight the final out, when Belle of Benalla
the second tip, outed the favorite, Daisy White, in
one of the best courses nf th" meeting. Bennett’s
Benefit won the Woodstock Cup.
“Fielder”: Re the measuring of courses
(B. 29/4/’2O). One Western District (Vic ) elrb
deputed the publican and the local pressman (myself)
to measure the new course and fix the positions for
the furlong' posts. The day before the races a book-
maker arrived and was asked to help. In the inter-
vals of lubrication the jinker wheel was measured and
the necessary revolutions calculated. The publican
then drove unsteadily around and we counted the
revolutions. The butcher's delivery horse and another
screw started the races with a match over six fur-
longs, the winner covering the distance in lmin.
I2see. 'Then the Trial, over the same distance, was
run in lmin. lOsec., but there was a devil of a row
when the publican’s horse won the mile in lmin.

get the club destroyed for non-compliance with
V.R.C. rules, but was eventually placated. Jhe Mel-
bourne dailies, by the way, solemnly appended all
these insane times to their reports of the meeting.
There will be a keen struggle for the
onerous and difficult billet of manager of the Aus-
tralian Eleven that is due in England next year.
Already various aspirants are showing on the sky-line,
among them Sydney Smith and E. E. Bean, the Ma
State and* Vie. stalwarts on the Board of Control. Both
have the ability to handle a collection which is often
as temperamental as a bunch of prima donnas, and
it may be that indecision regarding their respective
merits will lead to the choice of an outsider as a
compromise. Cricketers, however, are generally
agreed that the manager will have to be Smith or
Bean.
The long-delayed tussle between Melbourne
and ’Roy for the district cricket premiership fin-
ished last week in an easy win for Melbourne by
157 runs on the first innings. Melbourne totalled
267, Armstrong getting 74 and B-ogerson coming
next with a careful 49. ’Roy started hopefully
with two for 79 at the drawing of stumps on
the first day, but on resuming hostilities they col-
lapsed horribly, the last half-dozen contributing
five runs, and the whole side disappearing for 110.
Melbourne’s left-handed Ironmonger paralysed the
opposition, and got seven for 48. The honors in
’Roy’s attack were divided between Liddieut (five
for 71) and McDonald (four for 104).

Seems that the old cricket fever is return-
ing in some of the country districts. At Coonamble

up to see a match against a Sydney teaiTi, people
coming from as far as Walgett. The vicinity of the
ground was throrgod with travel-stained motor-cars;
and an old sport drove 75 miles from the Pilli.ga

-Vlurkah”: The greyhound versus race-
horse controversy threatens to be settled this winter
by Maddrell, of Braidwood (N.S.W\), who proposes
to carry out a series of tests on the local racecourse.
I tin the greyhound to win. This animal has been
developed purely for speed, weight-carrying not having
been considered. Also, the hound’s more concentrated
meat-diet necessitates a smaller stomach, i.e., less
cargo. This compactness of stomach compared’ with
the vegetarian flier permits an easier, more sweeping
action of the driving muscles astern and over the

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“‘Copy’ being dull to-day, 1 interviewed my * golf
caddie—Phil Brady, aged 12.” — Sabbath-day com-
munique < rom the Social front line.
“And did you meet the Prince, my boy? And did
you see him near?”
“I did,” responded Philip. “Point of fact, I met
him here.
“The pressmen and photographers first, swarmed on
to the ground.
Then came the Prince. ‘Brady,’ he said, ‘what do
you charge a round?’
“ ‘Two bob to you,’ I made reply; ‘it really should
be more ’
A correspondent teed his ball. The Admiral yelled
‘Fore 1’
“He took a driver from the bag and swung it round
his head,
Delivered a terrific swipe”——“Yes 1 Yes! Go on!”
I said.
“Don’t interrupt,” said Philip. “Never speak upon
the stroke.
Well, as 1 was about to say, the bally driver broke!”
“Oh, terrible!” I cried. “What next? Resume your
thrilling tale.”
“On what ensued,” Phil coldly said, “I shall impose
a veil.
“His dress? He had on boots, a shirt, a collar and
a hat;
A pair of trousers” “Great!” T cried. “Give me
some more of that.”
“Socks; or my eyesight was at fault.” “Their
color?” “I forget.
His friends were also dressed—that is, the only
ones 1 met.”
I wrung young Philip’s loyal hand. “Thank you,
my lad,” 1 cried ;
“The details you have given will be cabled far and
wide.
“From Adelaide to Darwin, and from Bondi Beach
to Broome;
Where arid drought prevails, and where Pacific
rollers boom,
“People will read your glowing words, and love
the British Throne
As though that piece of furniture were, so to speak,
their own.”
“Good,” said my young informant, as he rose and
sauntered oif;
“And tell ’em, while you’re at it, he’s a dam’ poor
hand at goff.”

Unless the official programme is slaugh-
tered, Edward will have hardly a moment to
call his own from the time he lands at Mel-
bourne on May 2(1 until he leaves the State.
He is to be ‘‘performing'’ all the time. Even
on Sunday afternoon. May 30, he is to be
the guest of Prime Minister Billy and his
dame. Donald Mackinuon, president, and
the committee of the Melbourne Club have
managed to get an evening (two hours) for
dinner with the Prince on June 3. As the
landing will not take place till 2.30 people
will not require to get up so early as they
thought on the morning of their holiday.
In general preparations are not so wide-
spread or expensive as some of the people
intent on profiteering expected, and they
are revising their plans accordingly.
If Edward could take off his prince-tilings
lor 10 minutes he would surely like to spend
the time cuffing the ears of the gushing
press which day after day continues to in-
sult him by referring to him. on the
threshold of 27. as a school-kid. What
must he think if he reads, for instance, that
his remarks at Honolulu made “a nice,
manly little speech”?
It is possible, of course, that the Prince
is pained at the crudity of the publicity cam-
paign which is being waged on his behalf,
but: has been informed that it is necessary
in the interests of the Royal business. But
why should Australia be injuriously differen-
tiated in this respect from, say, England ? No
such rancid stuff as we have been offered
has appeared in any London paper.
Modern Society was the only one that
ever attempted it; and it died a swift death.
The Naval and Military Ball has been
pushed round in the general re-arrangement
of Prince dates. It will roll in the Town
Hall (instead of at St. Kilda) on June IS.
Tickets are 12s. 6d. now—and that’s a
change, too.
The Women’s Hospital is to benefit from
a big ball in the presence of Edward Wales
at Melbourne Town Hall on the 31st iust.
Double and single tickets are five and three
guineas, and two guineas will buy a peep
at H.R.H. from upstairs. The cream of
sassiety has been skimmed to form a com-
mittee, and Edward will have a delirious
evening.
The new wife of Governor Allardyce,
newly arrived in the Apple Island, is
summed up as petite, with a gracious man-
ner, a sense of humor and a charming son
aged 20. And yet she looks only 28 or so.
She is an Englishwoman who learnt nursing
at the outbreak of war and worked in Eng-
lish and French hospitals. The Governor
lias a brace of sporty daughters aged 21 and
23, who have already imported some new
slang into the correct little Speck. Gov-
ernment House sent at once for a new
gramophone. All the family arc crazy
about dancing. His Ex. doesn’t jazz yet,
but the wife and daughters promise that he
shall soon be a zealot. They are devot-
ing themselves to that branch of his neg-
lected education.
Hobartians nearly let their eyes pop out
of their heads. The daughters of the new
Governor came to a reception without
plor.es! Hobart thinks it must be a new
London fashion. The leaves of the English
“society” journals are now rustling.
Late Excellency Goold-Adams, of Banana-
land, was a connoisseur of opals and had a
very fine collection, gathered from the Nor-
thern State, which he was taking to England.
His interest extended to the geological occur-
rence of the gems, and only last November
he made an examination of the Tintinbar
field in company with Government-geologist
Dunstan, securing three of the best speci-
mens found up to that date. In his collec-
tion he had a large “pin-fire” black opal of
fine quality for which he had said “No” to
an offer of £3OO.
Ross Smith aired his fassscinating lisssp
at Federal Parliament House last Thurs-
day evening, when members held a recep-
tion to welcome the aviator and brother
Keith to their own country. The dinner-
adjournment was stretched out a little for
the occasion; and members, with their sweet-
hearts-er-wives, half-filled the big Queen’s
Hall to say how-de-do. Afterwards, having
been welcomed by the Prime Minister in a
funereal speech which sdunded more like
crape and plumes than a glad-you’re-back
pjean, the beribboned youug men made a
rapid tour of the room, and were then
whisked off to have a talk with Ministers
in a less crowded spot.
A big business man is looking for blood.
A telegram addressed to him was, according
to the usual custom, opened by a clerk
before being passed on to him. The message,
however, was of a distinctly private nature,
and the contents were meant for the eyes of
the “chief” alone. An apology from the
Telegraph Department was stamped on the
inside saying that the message was’ three
words short and that a corrected copy would
follow. A few hours later this duly arrived.
The words added were: ‘Private’ on
envelope.”
Ilarrold W. Clapp's appointment as Chief
Railway Commissioner for live years at
£3OOO a year came as a complete surprise
to public men and the railway service. He
is the.son of F. B. Clapp, who was formerly
managing director of the Melbourne Tram-
way Co., and if he possesses the imperturb-
able civility of a salesman, which Arthur
Robinson says is essential, he has not in-
herited it from his dad. The new chief,
who has specialised in engineering and elec-
tric traction, is a son-in-law of the late
Judge Noel, of Queensland, and has three
children. lie is 44.
There were great doings at Berwick for
the official opening of the country branch
of the Presbyterian Ladies’ College. Special
trains steamed up, and the road had a full
procession of motors. Some Quaite Naice
girls are to get education and country air
mixed at the new academy. The ceremony
was Scawteh and impressive, with a fine
drawled speech by the Moderator, much
prayer and the Doxology. The programme
announced in advance that “Psalm 121 will
he sung by the School.” ’Varsity Chancel-
lor Mac far land had a word to say while he
spread his handsome red robes. Squatter
Andra Chirnside, of the district, was billed
for a speech, but sent, a telegram instead ;
lie was shut up in hospital for repairs. Mrs.
Chirnside came, however, and helped tho tea-
party. The Sharpes, Wilsons and other
Scotch residents were well to the fore; and
the Moderator’s silk stockings were much
admired.
Mrs. Knox Knight is honorary secretary
to that very live concern, the Educational
Committee of the Friendly Union of Sol-
diers’ Wives, Mothers and Sisters. The
Educational C o in-
to ill ee is looking
after the schooling
o f daughters an d
sisters of fallen
. Diggers, and has the
handling of dozens
of scholarships do-
nated by various col-
leges and technical
schools. So far it
has bon centra ted on
the placing of girls,
but the committee
is now discussing
the advisability of
including boys in
the lists. Mrs. Knox
Knight is the widow
of an officer who fell
in France, and all
her sympathies are in the work. Lady
Helen helps the scheme, and the committee
has the backing of Mrs. Victor Sellheim,
Mrs. Tivey and Miss Irving.
The Steward dame, wife of the Chief Com-
missioner of Police, was head battler in a
Jazzola ball at St. Kildn Town Hall to get
funds for the Civil Ambulance Service.
Everybody sat hard on expenses and the
committee limited its supper to a glass of
lemonade and a sandwich, so that all pos-
sible pennies might go to the cause. Mrs.
Mayoress Stein came late in an amber frock
that wa.s quite worth waiting for. Mrs.
Percy Berry put a lace gown into the pic-
ture and carried a colored ostrich-feather fan
that looked like an imitation of a black eye.
Mrs. Steward stencilled sketches of pre-
historic jazzers, and added them to the de-
corations. St. Kilda’s Mayor Allen pre-
sided in a large, hospitable way, and had
two daughters at the dance. Colonel and
Mrs. Springthorpe gave their help. Mrs.
Clarkson. Mrs. Tallis and the De Crespignys
decorated the dais. Miss Ilyams, the
organiser, in a joyous black and silver
dress, kept the programme up to concert
pitch. Muffled scarlet and amber lights
were hung about the hall, and gave the soft
effect ,of street lamps on a misty night.
Jazzing continued till 2 a.m. A bunch of
rushed sassiety revellers turned up toward
midnight, when the unmotored: section of the
dancers had cleared for last trams and
trains. Dick Wyllie, who was lion, secre-
tary, counted the heads with a complacent
smile. Nearly all the extras were donated
by committee helpers, and they look for a
big cheque for the Ambulance Service.
The imitation-marble effect of the main-
entrance pillars at the Town Hall has given
so much offence to the artistieklish eye of the
discerning citizen that the completion of
the outrage has been stopped. At present
the entrance suggests nothing so much as a
glorified butcher’s-shop; but the offending
color-scheme, on the initiative of architect
Stapley, who was emptied out of the mayoral
shoes year-before-last, is to be changed to
something in a neat pastel shade more in
keeping with the contours of the interior.
The Prince's troubles, anyway!
Hobart Anglicans turned out in force to
welcome the new Dean of Hobart. Arch-
deacon A. R. Rivers, who comes from
Northern Bananaland. He is the sixth occu-
pant of the office: his immediate predecessor
was Bishop Stephen. In replying to the
addresses of welcome, the new Dean said
that he had been dispensing religion in the
open spaces outback in Bananaland. in
public halls, pubs and so forth, and he was
quite impressed—in fact, almost oppressed—
by the size and importance of St. David’s.
Now some of Hobart is almost dreading
that he may draw comparisons between the
Christians of the wide spaces and the pubs
and the occupants of the cushioned Cathedral
pews.
Monteath made this picture of Claude M.
llaydon. who is responsible for the opera
of “Paolo and Fran-
cesca,” to be tried
at the Playhouse for
the first time to-
night. The opera
was begun two years
ago, and the libretto
is based on the ver-
sion of the romantic
tale presented by
Edward Vidler in
“The Rose of
Ravenna.” It is not
Haydon’s first con-
siderable composition.
He did th'e music
for the production
of “The Wasps” at
the Uni. Jubilee in
1906, and he is the
father of a brilliant
trio for piano, violin and ’cello which had a
great run at the Women’s Exhibition, lie
has also recitalled three times in pro-
grammes of his own composition, but the
unlucky loss of a leg in an operation a while
back compelled him to drop that methou of
self-revelation. Haydon, who is now 1.1(1, is
a Bachelor of Music, and an old pupil of
I)r. W. G. Price, the organist.
Said that Kilmany Park, the .property of
the late William Pearson, will shortly he
offered for sale. Roy has lately returned to
England, and Helen, the eldest daughter, will
shortly marry Willie Borthwick. Emily has
been wearing the matrimonial gold hoop for
some time now. Kilmany will be rather
large for Mrs. Pearson and her niece, the
remainder of a family of five.
After a long illness 11. A. Luke, part-
proprietor of the Gippsland Mercury, has
gone to have his proofs read. Ho was a
factor in the building up of Gippsland and
of Sale, and holds a firm place in the memory
of the people. One of his sons is a doctor,
the other a lawyer with an inherited taste
for journalism. Mrs. Luke, who is one of
the Buntines. is a personality in Melbourne
as well as in Gippsland, queening it in a
circle of friends that many a younger woman
envies.
Esther Crawcour, who crossed over from
Sydney to take her M.A.. sends an assur-
ance that her married name isn’t any more
unpronounceable than Henry—she is now
Mrs. Felix Henry, and it was in that name
slije took the degree. “And I’m happy to say
that the bad times are never a.s black as
they are painted,” she adds cheerfully.
Mrs. Cox. the widowed daughter of ex-
politician Murray Smith, has tracked back
to Australia, which she left many years ago
to marry and settle in England. Her
father has been an invalid for some years.
The Lost Dogs’ Home celebrated its
seventh birthday at North Melbourne on
Saturday. Mrs. Arthur Payne helped presi-
dent L. A. Adamson to receive the guests,
lots of whom fetched their pet pups to see
the four-legged orphans and improve their
canine minds. Tea was handed round in the
head-keeper’s best parlor, and the company
wandered about the home to pat the inmates
and view the lethal-chamber, which saves
thousands of sick and diseased dogs from
the worry and agony of living.
Adelaide’s hatful of news:—
After a riotous opening, it was expected that the
Palais de Danse would have a slack following night;
but a large number of youngsters turned up and
.jazzed energetically, and already the Palais reckons
oii a successful season. But why close down at
10.30 ? Of course, the last trams and trains do run
earlier and earlier, but there are a number of people
in Adelaide who can still crawl.
Said that C. E. Owen Smyth, the most outspoken
old patriot that ever trod on South A. corns, is busy
writing his autobiography. It should be an interest-
ing volume—as outspoken as that published years
ago by an old Adelaide citizen and now unprocur-
able, every available copy having been hastily
bought up by certain of our best families. Owen
Smyth moved to Devon lately.
David Waterhouse, a clever young solicitor, has
announced his engagement to Hazel King, of Wool-
lahra, Sydney. Sister Nellie Waterhouse is presently
going to marry Bruce Ross, another lawyer.
The Alliance Francais gave a cheery welcome to
the young French bride of Duncan Dawes, jun., at
the May Club last Thursday.
The King Edward statue has at last arrived, and
will probably be unveiled by his grandson in July.
It is to stand on North Terrace.
Hissed out suddenly, J. W. .Tones, ex-secretary
to the Minister of Works. Tie was born in Way-
mouth-street in 1843, on the day the city bridge
was opened, and only escaped being named City
Bridge Jones through the firmness of his parents.
The late Premier Peake was a poor man when he
entered politics, and had a large family to keep.
Although he had long periods of Ministerial office
there were many years in which he had to jog along
on a Parliamentary screw of £2OO. Yet he
lived so quiet a life that he left about £4BOO.
The newly-elected head of the Presbyterian
Church in S.A. is a Victorian, George Anderson, of
Port Augusta for the past four years. In his early
days he was in business at Broken Hill, and not
til] he was 24 did he enter Melbourne Uni., where
he worked up to the M.A. degree.
Though Mrs. Britton, of New Hindmarsh, was
only 57 when she died the other day, no less than
seven of her sons served abroad —four as Diggers,
two as Tommies and the other as a Jack. But if
she had honor she had also great grief. Three of
her boys were killed, and one who lost a leg on
the battlefield died on reaching home. The sailor
son was on two vessels which were torpedoed, but
escaped injury.
Canon Hughes, the picturesque liigh-
churchmau of St. Peter’s, Eastern Hill, who
lias been offered the bishopric of Rockhamp-
ton, is very popular as it marrying-parson.
no doubt because he yields full frill-value
for the money. One day he was giving
instructions to an altar boy shortly before
one of these ceremonies. “And,” lie concluded,
chuckling to himself behind his solemn exhor-
tations, “you'll have to kiss the bridesmaid,
of course.” Willie drank in the details with
wide-open eyes and mouth, and on the holy
occasion acted his part with perfect faith-
fulness, amazing the ltl-year-old girleen who
accompanied the bride by carrying out the
Canon’s kissing-instructions to the letter.
Not because clothes were so dear as they
are now, but because salaries were none too
liberal in pre-A.J.A. days, the staff of one
pretty-big provincial daily decided to
hire a frock coat and stovepipe tile to
serve all reporters “marked” for ceremonial
engagements during the visit of George and
Mary to their city. Each had only one
happy moment—when he shed the wretched
“wear” that could not very well accommo-
date itself to all figures.
For losing his temper and forcibly eject-
ing a lady whom his wife had engaged as
a nurse, a Melbourne man has been told
by a jury to part up £l75 —and costs! The
defendant was handicapped by two things—
first, by his nationality, which was said to
be Serbian, and in any case wasn’t Eng-
lish, and, secondly (and chiefly), by his
weight, which was in the vicinity of .lost.
As the plaintiff was slight and not bad-
looking, and as she was able to show an
examining doctor marks of roughness, the
odds in her favor were about 20 to 1. All
the same, £175! A lot of quite good-look-
ing Mary Janes Mould put up with it for
less.
Hobart musicians are arranging a fare-
well benefit to Mary Corvan, the Apple
capital’s leading pianist, who goes to
Europe to continue her studies. Miss Cor-
van is not a youthful prodigy: she has been
before the public for some years now as a
teacher of music and accompanist at all the
highbrow musical entertainments. Her
assistance to patriotic movements during the
war has made her popular, and a good send-'
off is assured.
As the Ormonde sails later than was ex-
pected, Ivy Philips’s farewell concert has
been fixed for Thursday, May 20. at the
Town Hall. The G.-G. and all the Very
Best will be there.
It is told of a wife in one of our official
sets that, she refused for many weeks to
call on the wife of a junior official in the
same set because wife the second had found
favor in the eyes of the husband of wife
the first. Finally, the call becoming insistent
owing to the words of her husband and the
duties of her position, wife the first drove
in her car to the door of the building in
which wife the second had her flat. Wife
the first, with intent to freeze, sent the chauf-
feur up with the cards. Now, it being the
Mary the maid’s afternoon off. wife the
second opened the door of the flat herself.
Instantly she saw a possibility of getting
her own back. Inviting the chauffeur to
wait a moment within, she disappeared. Five
more minutes and she had brought him tea.
adjuring him to wait while she wrote a
note to. his mistress. She thereupon disap-
peared into the bowels of the flat, and reap-
peared 25 minutes later, handing the chauf-
feur a sweet smile and a scented note. When
the man descended to a mistress blue with
the. half-hour’s wait, he handed her the note,
which read: “Dear.—So sorry you have been
kept so long waiting in the chill wind. Your
emissary, however, has been perfectly com-
fortable.” She leaves her own cards now\

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
David
Jouc'c
Calalog[?]
The Prince is to he entertained in Syd-
ney at a “select’' house-party dance at Gov-
ernment House. This sort ot' entertainment
is one to which the personal friends of the
A.D.G.’s are asked plus a sprinkling of citi-
zens of weight to give the show balance.
A maiden who has already been assured of
her invitation stated the purpose at the back
of the affair the other night. “Of course,”
she explained, “the Prince will want to meet
a few people of his own class while he is
here.
The staff and plucky t.b. boys at Boding-
ton were delighted with a visit from Bird-
wood, who broke his journey to the Caves
to pay his respects to the sanatorium that
broods over the Jamieson Valley. He didn’t
seem to care that all the food arrangements
on the way to Jenolan were being upset by
his prolonged call, and lingered on with some
of the really sick youngsters who are facing
their rendezvous with Death as pluckily as
he so often saw them keeping it at the sand-
hags.
The Conserve torium had never heard such
a babel of talk as there was just before eight
o clock on Friday evening. Every moment
one expected a frenzied Verbrugghen to
shriek for order, hut for once the King of the
Brasses was dethroned, and Miss Partridge,
Queen of the Lasses, was in the place of
honor; and as Principal of Fort-street Girls’
School for 25 years she’s had some experi-
ence of girls’ chattering. At live minutes
to, eight, when she walked down the aisle to
the stage, there was a sudden fol-
lowed sharply by an outburst of applause
that sounded like the tearing asunder of
thousands of yards of silk. This was a tiny
outlet for the emotion of the hundreds of
old pupils who filled the Conservatorium
hall to suffocation. In black taffeta, with
her hair dressed high and a black lace scarf
about her shoulders, Miss Partridge held
nothing of the terrifying blue-stocking in her
appearance, but looked what time has proved
her, a woman strong enough to temper jus-
wi,th uncl(n 'standing sympathy. Canon
Bellingham, Mr. Kilgour and Judge Cohen
basked in reflected glory, and some of the
brand-new Ministry came to give its support
to the three It s. The back of the stage was
a garden ot girlhood. White-clad the school
choir rose rank upon rank, their blooming
the flower of the seed sown by Miss Part-
ridge and her happy-looking staff. The
choir having declared the party opened, the
toacheis took the rest of the programme in
their hands, and demonstrated that classics,
logarithms and isosceles triangles need not
be impaired by a sweet voice and a taste for
Henley. Deputy head-mistress Evans and
Miss Plus-and-Minus Cohen helped to look
after the large party, and new Minister for
Education Mutch took the breath away by
a pun on his own name. Meanwhile a very
overcome headmistress was conscious only of
the waves of affection that flowed out to
her from her old girls. So absorbed was
she that even the picture of her as a
good little girl in prunella boots and cork-
screw curls, drawn by Mr. James, provoked
her to no violent dissent.
Dr. Isabel Ormiston, of our Uni., who
served well on the fronts of Belgium
h ranee, Montenegro and Servia, and until
recently was medical superintendent of
schools at Cairo (she held a similar position
some years earlier in Maoriland), has
changed _ her name to Garvice. Her new
partner is Major Chudleigh Garvice, with a
D.S.O. and an 0.8. E., who has a military
job m Alexandria, so it is probable the
doctoi-bride will not see Aussie again for
a good while. .
The Beethoven Mass in D will have to
be repeated. At seven o’clock on Saturday
you were lucky if you could get a ticket
and before eight a stream of disappointed
people was flowing away from the Town
HaU doors Beethoven’s Mass holds all
the florid fervor the vibrant appeal, that
shook the soul of the devotee when man
believing m a personal devil, flung himself
unreservedly upon the protection of an
infinitely Just and Merciful. Dulcie Iflnx
table, Mrs. Verbrugghen, tenor English and
basso Iloniam wrested the solo parts from
the choir but failed to conquer the orchestra
though the applause at the end of the two
hours showed that the audience bore them
no grudge for it.
Cook and Banks and Solander gave their
first public reception since the war, on the
shores of Botany Bay, last week, and
Swedish Consul Lindquist went armed with
a laurel wreath tied with the Swedish colors
so that scientist Solander might not feel
neglected. The G.-G’s. and H.M.A.S. Huon,
with Chief Justice Cullen and Judge Back-
house, paid their respects, and the Nielsen
Park Trust, the Historical Society, the
Royal Society, and the French Consul and
Mrs. Campana were amongst those at the
levee. But it was on their old friends, the
Cronulla schoolboys, that the three obelisks
turned their warmest smiles. N.B.—-James
Cook, explorer, wishes it known that he is
in no way connected with Joseph Cook of
the Navee.
In the evening, in the presence of the
State Exes., the Royal Apollos and the Con-
servatorium Orchestra put on the “Captain
Cook” cantata, words by P. E. Quinn and
music composed by J. A. Delany as far back
as 1888, when he was conductor of the
Liedertafel. The Town Hall was crowded,
and the cantata proved its evergreen quali-
ties despite the fact that the long, painful
voyage of discovery had left the voices of
the fo’c’s’le high and dry. Mrs. Goossens-
Viceroy, being Australia, artistically de-
clared :
No ruddy rain of battle
Shall make my roses red,
No long gold spray of wattle
Shall bloom o’er soldiers dead.
But before many a thoughtful face there
Hashed a vision of the incarnadined rose of
France, the glowing flowers of Parnassus!
His Ex. opens the Moree Show this week.
He and Lady Davidson left for the North-
West on Friday, on Saturday dined with
the Meyninks at Monargo, Collarenebri, and
looked in at Lightning Ridge opal-field on
Sunday, camping the night at Dunambral
station. After giving his blessing to the
show his Ex. will visit the Pilliga Scrub
country, returning to Sydney on Saturday
in time for the Boy Scout display in the
Inner Domain.
Clare Irving (she is a grand-daughter of
late cattle-king Clarke Irving, of Toinki
station, Richmond River) said she would
to Trooper Brian Egan—one of the Warren
Egans and lately returned from active ser-
vice—at the little sequestered church of
Saint Joseph, Woollahra, the other day. A
primrose-and-brown-frocked sister was brides-
maid, and Captain Jack Ryrie saw his
cobber through.
The party given by her old girls to the
former ruler of Abbotsleigh was a triumph
of personality for Marian Clarke, the woman-
leader with the Kitchener eyes, and her old
power of dominating the throng was as com-
plete as ever. Fashionable young women
who have flopped through at least two sea-
sons’ drawing-rooms unconsciously straight-
ened up and gave their spinal columns some-
thing to do. Miss Clarke has returned to
Wahroonga after years of absence and of
hard Red Cross work in England, but one
glance from the direct eyes, and a touch of
her hand, and many a tremulous past was
recalled. There
were no speeches at
the reception—t h e
savage, blurred melo-
dies of the jazz band
saw to that, while
the toes of some of
the younger girls
secretly waggled in
rhythm. V.A.D.
Enid Armstrong was
there, and she, as all
Abbotsleigh’s world
knows, was a first-
hand witness of an
exciting spy adven-
ture on the high
seas; and the pretty
Itolin girl, sparkling
Nell Jos k e. and
black-eyed Faith
Brodziak, one of the younger Dockers, Rus-
sell Jones, of course, and a bevy of North
bhore and Parramatta stars. Friendships
were renewed, old anecdotes retold —harrow-
ing scenes under the Reign of Terror—little
sad changes gravely discussed. And over all
the influence of one mind as of old.
Arthur Machin, of Cremorne, is the hap-
piest medicine-man in Sydney since Wini-
fred Murdoch promised to become Mrs.
Machin. Winnie’s title to fame does not
rest on the fact that she is poetess Nina’s
sister. The pretty girl with the fine brown
eyes is sister in charge of the tuberculosis
dispensary at the North Sydney Hospital.
Last year she volunteered for ’flu duty, and
Azrael nearly gathered another blossom. .Be-
fore that she had offered her arm as an
experimental ground for the bites of fever-
infested mosquitoes, and hides among her
treasures a gold medal presented to her by
Dr. Baton and the Board of Health—“ For
Courageous Assistance in the Cause of
Science.” The Machin family is making the
gardens of Roseville ring with the charm of
their future fair kinswoman.
Artist Percy Spence, who married one of
the Wright girls, of Manly—they have been
living in England for some years—has lately
achieved two sons-in-law: daughter Una
married Captain Pearson, of the Royal
Engineers, and Elvira became Mrs. John
Norton. Her husband is president of the
Civil Courts in the India Service. Percy
has just finished a large canvas, “The Sur-
render of the German Fleet.”
St. Andrew’s, Summer Hill, poured its
blessing on the wedding of Jessie Reid, of
Ashfield, and R. Goddard, son of Canon God-
dard, of Petersham. The usual choral ser-
vice, with white satin and silk tulle bridal
drapings, accompanied the ring-giving,. which
was watched over by the bridegroom’s parent.
Molly and Peggy Reid, in old-gold satin and
carrying bunches of gold and dark-brown
chrysanthemums, completed the tableau at
the altar steps. Blair Athol, the home of
bride’s mother and father, provided refresh-
ment for nearly 100 guests.
This is P. E. Quinn, who at 25 wrote
the words for the “Captain Cook” cantata.
He’s a brother of that boyish Viking, Rod,
and father of Marjorie, who, poor girl, has
been harried into
poetising in sel f-
defence. Marjorie
tells a story of being
taken to the Zoo one
winter afternoon by
father and uncle
Rod. After a pro-
longed silence Mar-
j o rie asked:
“Father, do the
Polar bears really
find this a warm
afternoon?” N o
reply. “Father,”
commenced Marjorie
again. “P lease,
don’t talk to me,
Marjorie,” came the
answer—“can’t you
see I am compos-
ing?” Marjorie turned to uncle. “Uncle
Rod, do the Polar bears’’ —Uncle switched
his blue eye from the horizon for a second.
“Marjorie,” he said, “/’m jugt thinking out
a little song.” “Then,” Marjorie explains,
to justify her own good verses, “I thought it
time to do a bit of composing myself.”
Vere Kirkpatrick, daughter of the John
Kirkpatricks, of Logan Brae, Bellevue Hill,
married her Captain Theodore Vincent Riley
at St. Philip’s last week, with Marjorie and
Dorothy Kirkpatrick and Lerida Leslie cast
as bridesmaids, in pale blue, pink and yellow
frocks respectively, while three Digger p|ils,
Sandford, Holland and Forsyth, played sup-
porting male leads. The Australia saw the
party.
Last year over 24,000 children were
treated at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for
Children, and this year the institution asks
your help to increase the accommodation. It
claims to have the highest record for paint-
ing dimples into baby cheeks, and it asks
you to go out just once to see the little mites
in their suffering and in their convalescence,
and it knows that its cause and your cheque
are won.
Mrs. Herrick Knowles got away by the
Orvieto to London and Madge and Dion
and the wonderful Titheradge baby nieces
and nephews. Another choir of Bishops
left by the same vessel, and Linda and Kath-
leen Scott Fell, with Dad and a bundle of
golf-sticks.
Ruth Macarthur, who is so like her twin
sister Phillis that not one person in ten
can tell them apart, left last week to join
her friend Mrs. Libby Hordern in Europe.
The handsome Mrs. Tabby went last year
with Miss Monie to England via Japan, and
is thinking of taking a villa on Lake Como
dux-ing the summer.
Young Bettington, who distinguished him-
self last week in the Oxford Freshmen’s
cricket match as a bowler, belongs to the
Merriwa station-owning family, all of whose
male members have been keen on the game.
The Bettingtons have been old Parramatta
identities for generations.
Back in Sydney, Max Selinsky, the Rus-
sian violinist who formerly gave joy in Mel-
bourne. Max has been in Honolulu for two
years, and when he decided to leave there
the grateful residents passed around the hat
and in two days collected $2OOO, with which
they purchased a Laurentius Storioni bear-
ing the 1769 brand. On this fiddle Selinsky
will perform at his Sydney recitals on the
12th and the 14th. After that he goes to
South Africa.
Dorothy Kennedy drops a line to intro-
duce the new baby, who was born under
the Stars and Stripes three weeks after the
young Australian parents reached New York.
For the first few weeks it was nothing but
Baby Rhapsodies for Lauri and Dorothy;
then the little ’cellist had to be handed over
to the charge of a Swiss nurse, for mother
was engaged to play accompaniments at
singing studios where the gilt-edged send
daughter to have the rasp extracted from
her upper register. The clever S’Austra-
lian also played Stella Power’s accompani-
ments for the Edison records. Kreisler,
Casals and cousin-by-marriage Moiseiwitch
have bestowed approval and friendship upon
them, and good old John McCormack has
proved a dinkum friend. He and his mana-
ger McSweeney engaged Lauri for a six-
months’ tour of the States. So Dad and
Dorothy are quite a busy pair of nest-
builders.
Died lately Mrs. Oliver Peacock, who was
first the wife of Harry Smith, for years
lessee of railway refreshment-rooms. With
the money made from the coffee and sand-
wich-counter Harry set out to build a man-
sion and found a family. So it was that
Curzon Hall, a curious labyrinth of unex-
pected staircases and beautiful panelling
arose, and the Harry Smiths became the
Curzon Smiths. Harry died some time
back, whereupon his widow, a tall, Juno-
esque woman, in complexion what our
American cousins call a “natural blonde.”
married Oliver Peacock, who had come to
Australia with the Scarlet Troubadours.
The Little Citizens did the real entertain-
ing at the Kindergarten Training College
party the other afternoon after her State
Ex., in grey, had told of her interest in the
kindergarten teacher’s job, and H. Y. Brad-
don had cordially endorsed all she had said
with a rider to the effect that there should
be more kiddies’ playgrounds in Sydney. A
nice litter of scholastic somebodies purred
approval: the John Mackays radiated an
aura of good thoughts; secretary Miss De-
sailly supported the movement in a black
costume and a silk Maltese collar; Miss
Windeyer brought as much of the Mitchell
Library as she could carry in a strap; Dr
Riley, Miss Wearne (Claremont College!
and Miss Williams (Women’s College!
and Miss Starling from the Pyrmont Kinder-
garten—she studied the Montessori system
right on its native heath —were among‘those
who watched Tiny Tim and his little sister
dance and play in rings about the lawn, man
a ship and send her sailing across the grass-
green sea. Girls in white, with the placid,
mother-wise eyes of the kindergarten teacher!
played with their pretty charges; and sud-
denly one understood that it was the fairy
in all children that makes them love most
of all to sing and dance in rings upon the
green.
Dr. M. R. (Dick) Flynn, an old Marist
boy, left by the Niagara, carrying in his
kit the _ Walter and Eliza Hall travelling
fellowship for two years. Dr. Flynn gradu-
ated in arts, science, medicine and surgery
at our Uni. He is the eldest sop of Dr
John Flynn, and two other brothers are
following in father’s trail.
Crossed the range, on April 9, at Sydney.
Mrs. J. 1. Allan, widow of Black Allan, of
Mt. Enniskillen, on the Barcoo (Q.). Mrs.
Allan was one of the first “white Marys”
on the Barcoo, and that was 60 years ago
Black Allan was much whiter than his name,
and none passed his door empty-handed.
Mrs. Ellis Rowan’s unique collection of
paintings of native flora and fauna threatens
to leave Australian botanists and entomolo-
gists, and they are quivering in anguish at
the thought that some other country is going
to possess what should be the heritage of
young Australia. The little lady has re-
ceived an offer of £16,000 from America for
her studies of the shy beetle and bird, the
fungi and the flower of New Guinea; but,
a true patriot, she wants the results of her
labor to stay with her own people, and is
willing to make a sacrifice of much solid
money that it may do so. But the firm
American offer cannot be hung up indefi-
nitely.
Note from an Australian girl in England:
she is industrial organiser for the National
federation of Women Workers of Great
Britain, and is writing of a strike at South-
ampton, where she had some business: —
The men’s district secretary here is one of the
finest men I’ve come across. He is quiet, straight,
a hard worker, kindness itself, intelligent and in-
revesting, and had a great grandfather who was
transported to Australia for life in 1832 on a
charge of conspiracy, for urging his fellow-agricul-
tural laborers to meet and formulate a demand for
an increase on their wage of 2s. per week.
!!'rh e Convict (God bless him!)” indeed, as
‘C.H.B.” said in a recent Bulletin.
One of the identities of Berrima has died
a £ Cottage, Bowral. He was the son
of that George Riley who came to Sydney
in the early days and was one-time owner
of the Riley estate and also of the Broom-
field estate, Bowral, a portion of which is
now the country home of Sam Hordern.
Miley, who belonged to an old
family of English sportsmen, leaves a widow,
one son and two daughters.
Sister C. D. Soper, chaperon of a
batch of Land Girls and W.A.A.C.’s who
have come this -way, belonged to our harbor
city, but for the past 20 years has been in
England, mostly as matron of orphanages
and hospitals. Early in the war she joined
up with the 8.E.F., and served in England
and Salonika. After discharge, infant wel-
fare being her long suit, she became a visit-
ing nurse for the Woking Health Society.

write in ink instead of that accursed mixture of sour
milk and turnip juice... .Becip. Cyn: The amateur
bushman is worn out....J.R. (New Farm): Very
dull. ... A.N.: An uninteresting' suicide in very
lumpy metre... .L.G. (Albury) : Confound the night-
ingales ! Are there no birds of our own?....The
Waiter: Nothing there.... Larrikin Mick : Don’t know
what it means... .Stiff: Too crude. ... J.T.W.:
“Fire” not for us D.L.T.: It's a bit too thin
Pierce B.: Rotten.... E.M.T.: Don’t wonder they
all got tired. .. .The Mad Hatter: None of the people
in the yarn matter fourpence. .. .F.J.C.: Too bald
and unconvincing H.R.O.: It doesn’t arrive; but
it goes iu the right direction. .. .Blanche G.: 100
p.c. commonplace A.C'.A.D.: The verse has no
quality and you don’t seem to have much to say....
A.O.M.: The “Ode” has too many trite remarks
obviously put in for the sake of the rhyme. Most
modem odes sin in the same way, but the successful
authors have the skill to throw a fine drapery of
words over the bad spots. . . .P.B.P.: The verse nearly
shook our teeth out. . . .H.R.C.: Not good enough. . . .
Chick S.: A long way off F.E.S.: One stanza:—
There is always a shade.
Though never the same,
Rich with its colors
Of most luxurious greens;
’Tis there the scenes
Remind one of deeds
That could be performed
With comparative ease.
. .. . A.T.S.: Glad to know that May is a spring
month in Victoria B.C.: “The Miracle” loses its
surprise effect through the previous statement that
such a happening would surprise. ... M. S.: “Selling
the Key” doesn’t work.. . .Win: There's a yarn there,
and it is worth brighter treatment... .M.M. (South
Yarra) : Doesn’t ring true.. . .G.R.: “Alcaics” glow
faintly, but lack interest. .. .Simplex: No. .. .D.A.D.:
It states all the commonplaces... ,R. Fits: Too
slight.... H.F.W.: Doesn't convince, .. .G.D.M.:
“Half-way House” not up... . See B.: No use....
A .F.K.: It. s thin. We don’t like either the gram-
matical reversions nor the paucity of rhymes....
D.M.: “Thompson” is too like a school essay
Francis D. : It isn’t quite English, but there's a
fresh note there you might cultivate. ... Soda Sudd:
Parodies are poor things, and yours is on the bottom
rung E.M. (Oakleigh) : The wail doesn’t go
John Kendrick B.: It isn’t verse and it doesn’t say
anything.... Will K.: Too weak to itagger through.
. ...R.G.S.: Ditto. .. .L.M.D.: The “Blacksmith” is
no good, and the other is worse.... F.C.C.: No
improvement H.G.l.: No use J.A.K.: No mar-
row in the bones Malcolm M.: Doesn’t strike us.
.. . .R.W.C.: The yarn beats the verse; hut neither
wins.... Stella K.: Well, the girl got him with the
usual novelette trimmings, but the dreadful event
doesn’t seem to call for publicity C.C.M.: You
can do much better. .. .R.D.F.: No. . . .Edith T.:
“Storm” doesn’t say enough.... Cradle: It may be
the “keynote of glory,” but it doesn t sound much
of a noise to us F-.W. (Melbourne): Good idea.
Give it more attention E.J.G.: Your “outburst of
feeling without any effort” fs here let off the chain:
. .. .E.M.T.: There may be something in your scrawl,
but it is not possible to rear! it... .A.D.L.S.: It is a
pi omising first attempt. Get more story and less
commonplace. .. .M.M.C.: Can't find any joy in it.
. ...C.F. (Dunedin): Don’t care for it....H.D.P :
Very lame... .T.H.AV.: Don’t believe a word of the
horrible yarn... .C.D.C.: “Dutchman” wants a good
deal of planing and mending C. H. Tompson:
You make one small mistake. The B. doesn’t want
the “primary producers” to support the manufac-
turing industries. It wants manufacturing indus-
tiies to support the farmers. If foreign markets
would supply all that the farmer wants, why hasn’t
he been prosperous? The foreign markets have been
open to him all the time Billy: It sounds like the
Sydney Bilious Club getting to it after lunch....
Cit: Yes, but there’s this to remember—if those men
were not a bit coarse in the fibre they couldn’t do
their rough job. Maybe the community has to suffer
now and then for the coarseness; but it gets the very
necessary work done. .. .Scottie the R: Good. Go
ahead. . . .A.D.L.S.: Good for a first shot. But the
conclusion docsn t seem right. You work up sym-
pathy for a “heroine” and then (rather clumsilv)
turn her into a silly ass.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A.E.II.: Can’t use any of them. .. .G.D.W.: The
dreamy gravedigger is shovelling shadows, and the
gag is a chestnut. Learn something about draw-
ing. .. .C.P.A.: A sad thing... .Joseph B.: You
are young, Joe, and you may improve. ...F.W.: No
animation.... F.D.: You leave out too much....
L.A.: Both fail A.G.F.: It isn’t a subject for
laughter... .Cam: Is the barber hitting his patient
with the three stars?. .. .F.G.: You draw badly and
have an unpleasant taste in gags F.S.: You’ve
still got something to learn. Plug on. .. ..J.E.J.
Dim experiment in pencil. Don't want it E.L.:
Bit messy, don’t you think? S.H.: There is
nothing worse this week A.W.: Not a particle of
humor. .. .O.E.B.: Refuse to stir up the sectarian
issue with bad art... . W.O.G.: Scrapbook stuff only.
• • • -C.G.: Beautifully wooden, ,. .Ena R.; Not this
time.
AY hen the Muse moves me, lo, I must sing;!
The music in my soul overpowers me, makes my
thoughts take wing.
Beautiful words one after another like beads on a
string,
T ill all the world is awoke just to hear my son 0,
sing.
Sad must he be who have no ear for the tune,
And blind must he be who sees not poetry in the
moon.
These ears have I and these eyes have I to mike
echoes ling
And bring gladness to the world when it hears my
song sing.
In the morn when the birds chortle their songs to the
sky,
AA ith my whole bosom aburst full of song so do I,
And we the infant day with the melodies that
we fling,
And an orld seems to rise when they hear our
song sing.

Don’t Neglect a Cold —
It's Dangerous.
There's danger in a cold. The cold you get may be timely warning of some-
thing more dangerous to follow. Some people catch cold easily—no sooner one cold
cured than they get another one. That’s dangerous. A cold lowers the vitality ami
weakens the whole body. It starts with watery eyes, sore-all-over feeling, and
perhaps runs into influenza, bronchitis or pneumonia. So prepare for trouble before
it troubles you. A bottle of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is a safeguard against
such ills. , , .
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is a preventive as well as a remedy, and is a
necessity in every household.
Remember, a dose of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery should be taken before a
cold weakens the system. It is the modern “break-up-a-cold” remedy, and will not
only banish your cold but will strengthen your chest and lungs. When 'buying,
medicine everyone knows that it is quality, not quantity, that counts, so be wise and
take a bolttle of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery home with you to-night. Price 1/6 & 3/-.

Rounding the Buoy on Plume
Plume has made good on all types of motors,
from the big cruiser to the portable motor on
the row-boat. Satisfactory motoring de-
pends upon freedom from engine troubles ;
therefore the question of benzine quality is a
most important factor with motor-boat
owners.
Motor experts agree that
PLUME BENZINE
is idea! for motor-boat owners
Plume vaporises instantly—that means easy Starting.
Plume forms a perfect gas, leaving no trace of raw fuel
to cause carbon troubles. f lume is uniform ;it gives
sweet running and steady, reliable power always, and
a gallon takes you further.
Whether it’s a motor boat, a car, or a motor cycle,
Plume will give you maximum engine efficiency.
Don’t ask for Benzine—say Plume.

Old Romance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
UNLESS you are brave leave the steed
in the stall;
Sally not forth when the mist is grey
Over the stone of the castle wall,
And the rose of the East is budding Day.
Unless you are brave let the gauntlet hang
In the oaken chest; let the morion lust
And the scabbard muffle the broadsword’s
clang;
Let the jack-boot venture no roadside dust.
Unless you are brave leave the tvicket-gate
Latched close, and wait till the dew has
dried;
Bid Romance at the postern wait,
And never lit by the dawn-star ride.
Unless you are tempered as truest steel
And ready to carry an unhealed sear,
Oh. bide in your chapel at home and kneel,
But hie not forth where the Real Things
are!
Chimney corners are safe and snug ;
Stalled chargers grow plump and grey.
Then leave yours hitched in his tasselled rug,
No ’broidered saddle, no holsters gay !
There’s a beechen log in the chimney-place,
There is cider brewed, there is ale and
wine,
And you may not follow the gypsy face
That beckons you in the shade and shine.
Shadow of leaf on a lovely lip,
Golden freckle on rounded chin —
If the latch of the wicket-gate should slip
And the charger tire of the fat corn-bin?
Heels go hammering on the stall;
Teeth go snapping at ostler’s arm.
"What’s come to the war-horse —save us all!
’Ware of his h00f5.... he’ll do ye harm!”
What’s come to yourself when you think of
itt
The log sinks down in a ruddy heap;
It is safe by the inglenook to sit,
To wake, and swallow, and yawn and sleep.
A rag of the gypsy’s gown was caught
In the hinge of the gate as they thrust
her through ;
A rag of a gypsy’s gown is naught
But —sap of your youth ! —it has spelled
to you
Forests climbing the gaunt black hills,
Midnight caves where the wild men hide,
Wind-clean moors, and a. hundred rills,
And the great green worlds where a man
may ride! ■
If her breast was only a gypsy’s breast—
Not white and laced in a stiff brocade,
But amber fire to a quick mouth prest—
Such breasts for a man’s hot lips were
made!
Decorous snow of my lady’s throat,
Cover it up with the fine brocade!
You have heard the call of the gypsy note
And the mocking echo, “Are you afraid?”
Are you afraid? Ah, the charger knows!
He has broken free from the binding stall!
In the open courtyard he rears and blows
And his bright eye shows that he feels it
all!
Ah. God. for the hills and the rolling plain!
The cider spills on the cedar floor
And the wine has deepened its saffron stain—
But a step has crossed them towards the
door!
Oh. better to die in the ambushed glade
With your head back-thrown and your
sword-arm free
Than, full of years, by your grandsires laid
Under the murk of the same yew-tree.
Better to die, if die you must,
With the boughs above you in golden mist,
With a red on your blade that is not of rust
And her soft mouth bruised with the kiss
you kist.
To leave her memories that cannot die
As she draws her gown o’er her body again,
And the gre*en earth runs to the azure sky
And the zest goes singing through all the
pain !
The ashes feather the tiles with grey.
A fallen tankard, a taken chance —
And a new disciple rides forth to-day
To follow the trail of "the Old Romance!
QUEENSLAND.

The Quick and the Dead.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DOWN by the Isle of Dogs—that lovely
bank of mud and Thames silt where
King Charles 11. bred and reared the
long-eared curiosities that have done so much
to perpetuate his pious memory—the con-
vict transport Surprise swung at her moor-
ings in the yellow stream, and looked even
picturesque as she silhouetted her tall spars
and black shrouds against the setting sun,
on a frosty evening in December, 1759.
Captain Nicholas Twopenny —“The Tup-
penny Devil” of the Guinea slave trade —
regarded her through the window of the
Green Turtle Inn at Deptford, as he smoked
his churchwarden pipe after the good dinner
which his owner, Mr. Isaac Penruddock, of
St. Swithin’s-lane, in the City of London, had
generously provided on the eve of his sailing
for the new settlement in New South Wales.
He regarded her with affection and admira-
tion, not only as an object of graceful beauty
in the fading twilight of a winter’s day,
but also as the source and origin of that com-
fortable competence which he was laying up
against the undeniably approaching time
when the great waters would be no more
honored by bearing him upon their bosom. A
market-garden at Tooting Beck, long even-
ings before the fire in the jolly tap-room
of the Boar’s Tusk in that eligible neigh-
borhood, whilst he sipped hot spiced rum
and related those astounding lies for which
he was so justly famous —a mellow and
comfortable old age spent in hard-earned
ease: those were the things that the little
ship in the stream stood so gracefully for in
his pleasant contemplation of her dark out-
lines. She had treated him well. He
felt that he could very fittingly regard her
with admiration and affection.
A very striking personality was that of
the master of the Surprise; no one having
once met him was ever likely to forget him.
Picture Captain Kidd, or the bold and bloody
buccaneer Morgan, grown fat and a little un-
wieldy, red of face and ample of waistcoat.
Imagine the legendary presentment of John
Bull, and plant in such a physiognomy as
you may conjure up—a countenance denoting-
exuberant villainy, boldness and hardihood,
and a gross sensuality of nature —two little
pig's eyes that twinkled with a cunning that
was almost supernatural, and you will have
a very fair impression of the gentleman w’ho
was sitting over a bowl of punch in the
coffee-room of the Green Turtle, in the com-
pany of that sour Quaker, egregious Cousin
Jack and very sound man of business, Isaac
Penruddock, West India merchant and slave-
dealer. It is not often that you may have
a chance of contemplating two such super-
rogues in the enjoyment of each other’s
company.
•• ’Tis like, friend John,” observed Mr.
Penruddock, ‘‘to be a very profitable venture.
That is thine opinion?”
Captain Twopenny withdrew his gaze
from his ship, and bent it upon the meagre
form and rat-like features of his owner.
“Profitable!” he bellowed, in bull’s
voice. “Mink me, Isaac—‘profitably’ ain’t
the word. Why, I”
The Cornishman interrupted him with up-
lifted hand. “Cap’n,” he said, disap-
provingly, “I must beg thee not to swear
profanely in my presence. Thou canst very
well express thyself without such language,
if thou triest. Pray do so —and remember
that I am a vessel of the Lord as well as
thy owner. I beg of thee.”
Captain Twopenny looked at the Quaker
a little contemptuously, lie curbed, how-
ever, the savage and obscene retort that
leapt to his lips and that wmuld have un-
doubtedly sent Mr. Penruddock shuddering
from the room, his fingers in his ears. With
a grin of amusement on his fat jowl, he lifted
his glass to his lips and toasted the other
genially. “Y’ very good health, Isaac; an’
may y’r ears never be offended by one who
likes ye less!”
With a stiff bow Mr. Penruddock ac-
knowledged the good wish. “Hast thou all
things in order, then, Cap’n? The convicts
aboard, and the provisions in the hold as
per the requirements of the Navy Office?”
“Aye, th’ scoundrels are safe below hatches
—where they’ll stop an’ rot to death, if Jack
Twopenny has any say in the matter.”
“There were sufficient sets of irons to
confine them safely?”
“More than enough. D’ye know, Isaac,
that mealy-mouthed Mr. Timothy—l don’t
like that fellie —he’d the impidence for to
take exceptions to them slave irons w T e’ve
been a-usin’ wi’ comfort an’ success all these
years past, so he had. What th’ Board o’
Transport wants wi’ such fools I can’t
comprehend. Dash my boots —that ain’t
swearin’, Isaac—he gives it out they’re in-
humane, an’ was a-wishful they should be
changed. Did ever ye hear such cranky
nonsense ? I told him. Says I: ‘Look it
here, Master Timothy, them bilboes was good
enough for th’ Guinea trade, an’ I think
they’re good enough for this. We had to
regard th’ health of them slaves we carried,
them bein’ vallyble cargo. Couldn’t afford
for to lose ’em. We had to carry ’em com-
fortable, for to land ’em alive an’ lively,
else the market’d go flat. An’ you don’t
think these here irons good enough for th’
gaol-birds we’ve got aboard now! Why,
dash me boots,’ I says to th’ little whipper-
snapper, ‘you want for to pamper ’em wi
high livin’. Them there bilboes,’ I says, ‘has
been proved th’ very thing. Can’t be beat,’
I says.”
“And what was his reply to that, Cap'n?”
“The outrageousness of th’ fellie! He
says they was cruel implements o’ torture!
An’ he’d report to th’ Board, so he would.”
“And then, Cap’n? What hadst thou to
say to this folly?”’
“The soft answer, Isaac, that turns away
wrath. ‘Come into th’ cabin,’ I says, ‘Mister
Timothy, y’r honor, an’ we’ll talk it over,’ I
says. ‘Now. lookee here, sir,’ I says, ‘d’ye
like Jamaica?’ ‘I do,’ he says. ‘Then a
hogshead of th’ best goes to your house in
the Minories this very eve,’ I says. And so
th’ business was settled. Ye’ll not have to
provide any new irons, Mr. Penruddock, an’
ye can thank old Jack for that. Ila, ha!
Th’ Tuppenny Devil’s th’ one for ’em —ain’t
he now?”
“Thou didst well, John. ’Tis like thee
to think o’ such a thing, and I am much
beholden to thee. The hogshead of Jamaica
wall be at thy charge, friend Twopenny
Thou hast acted very wisely.”
“Ho, ho —at my charge?”
Captain Twopenny looked a little dis-
gusted. But he forebore to protest. He
knew the way to make good the hogshead of
rum.
“As to the .quality of the provisions.
Cap’n—have they been passed?”
“Aye, th’ cheapest could be got in all Lon-
don. Th’ salvaged stores of an Indiaman
that went ashore on the Goodwins five year
ago. A little th’ worse for age, mebbe,
but quite good enough for them lags. Oh,
quite.”
“We should do well.”
“That we should, Isaac. I look to re-
tire from the sea after this voyage. See
here. We’ve under hatches, now, 2f>6 o’ th’
varmints. I am allowed lid. per head per
diem to feed th’ lousy scuts. There’s no
dockin’ of the allowance when a man dies.
So the sooner they dies th’ better. An’, by
George, they’ll die, right enough. Th’ Sur-
prise’s a wet ship, as well ye know; an’ in
any weather they’ll be to their middles in
water, in them prison quarters. We’ll get
the weather at this time o’ year, an’ there

A MAM IS AS STRONG AS HIS BACK
A Man can only do as much work as his back will stand.
Once the back gives out he must lay down his tools.
But that is not all, for Backache tells of sick kidneys. Other unmistakable signs are dizziness
stiffness of the limbs, sick headache and sleeplessness. Before long the patient grows nervous’
short tempered and depressed; the eyes become heavy and sunken, with swellings beneath
them, and the color flies from the cheeks. There is danger of
serious kidney disease, rheumatism and dropsy. The liquid poison
which causes kidney troubles is driven from the body quickly
and thoroughly by the genuine Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. This
great medicine will strengthen your back by relieving and toning
up the kidneys.

A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. F. W. Martin, “Hastings,"’ 50
Dekpointes Street, Marrickville, Sydney,
says:—“About two years ago 1 took
a course of Doan's Backache Kidney
Pills for a severe attack of kidney disorder,
and they permanently cured me. Previous
to using these pills I had a lot of trouble
with my back, it was very stiff and always
aching. At times it was only with diffi-
culty I could get about, and if I stooped
the agony in standing up again was awful.
I was also subject to dizzy attacks, and felt
constantly tired and languid. I heard of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills through a
friend, so got some at once, and they suited
me splendidly, and restored me to perfect
health. I am still well, and have been since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me
about two years ago.”
Mr. Martin confirms his previous state-
ment. four years later: “I have had no
trouble with my kidneys since Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills cured me six years ago.”

A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. J. Smith. “Bonnie I)oon, M Duncan
Street, Arncliffe, Sydney, says:—“My kid-
neys were in a bad way for some time, and
1 suffered terribly from backache in conse-
quence. I could not stoop freely;,in fact, all
my movements were handicapped owing to
the nagging ache that used to catch me
across the kidneys. My rest at night was
broken, and during the day I felt tired and
languid, having no energy for anything. I
was advised to try Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills, so sent for some at once. They
worked wonders in my case, giving relief
almost immediately and gradually effecting
a complete cure. I took three bottles in
all. and my cure is perfect. Six years have
elapsed since I used' Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney l ills, and I have been well all that
time. They are a grand remedv.”
Four years later Mrs. Smith'says:— “My
cure still holds good, no sign of kidnev
trouble having returned since I used Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills ten years ago."

should be a good quarter of 'em dies afore
we gets down into milder latitoodes. A
quarter easy—mebbe more. That’s all to
th’ good. Isaac. An’ I think we can
count upon losin’ some more from th' scurvy
in sich a long voyage. Oh, 'twill pav right
enough! Better than black ivory even,
Mister Penruddock.”
“Well, I must get back to London.” said
Mr. Penruddock, rising. “There’s a discus-
sion at the Friends’ Meeting House in Fins-
bury to-night on the subject of Prison Re-
form. ’Tis to be addressed by the good
Mr. John Howard, and I would fain be
present. The worthy philanthropist is much
interested in our service of transportation,
and desires. I understand, to make the ac-
quaintance of an humble vessel, such as
myself, who has to do with it. So I’ll take
lea”
“Haw. haw. haw!” guffawed Captain Two-
penny. “Ye’ll be able to tell him a deal
about it. won’t ye. IsaacV"
Mr. Penruddock took no notice of this
sly levity.
“I will take leave of thee. John." he said
with dignity. Then, raising his eyes
devoutly to the ceiling: “May the great and
good God who guideth our footsteps watch
over thee, and have thee in 11 is keeping,
m.v dear Cap’n. Heaven bless the ship and
all who make passage in her!”
On the 3rd of June, 1700, the first ship
of the Second Fleet, the Lady Juliana,
closely packed with female convicts, entered
Port: Jackson, and on the 20th, 26th and
2Nth was followed up the harbor by the
Justinian. Surprise. Scarborough and Nep-
tune. The ladies were mostly pretty well:
the men were mostly dying.
As they slanted across Shark Island, beat-
ing up against the winter westerly. Captain
Twopenny walked the poop of the Surprise
in high good humor with himself and the
world. He was wearing his gold-laced three-
cornered hat, a blue coat with brass but-
tons, white knee-breeches and silk stockings.
There were gold buckles on his shining shoes,
and he was freshly shaven. A very impos-
ing figure to cheer these outcasts in Sydney
—he had no doubt that he was that.
Near him Captain Hill, of the recentlv-
raised New South Wales Corps, in which he
was second captain, spied out the land with
the second mate’s telescope. This officer,
having made a voyage in the Alexander when
the First Fleet came, over two years ago,
was competent to point out the features of the
ontrancingly lovely sheet of water they were
navigating.
“That’s Bradley’s Head,” he said, point-
ing to it—“named after Mr. Bradlev. the
First Lieutenant o’ th’ Sirius. An’ there’s
Garden Island, where her crew tried growin’
vegetables soon after we came here. Ye see
the little island in the stream? Well, they
call that Pinch gut. because they put th' bad
'tins there, on half-rations.”
“Haw, haw, Mister Hill, well-named, eh?
W ell-named—oh, very well!” the captain
broke in upon this lesson in geography,
expanding with affability. Captain Hill
glanced at him with dislike, and turned to
the second mate, young Mr. Bultitude, with-
out replying.
And where, pray, my dear Mr. Bultitude,
is the town? i can see no trace of it as
yet. A magnificent place it is indeed ! But
now lonely—how unoccupied! Were it not
for that boat-sail ahead of us. one nnght
almost assume that we were the discoverers
of all this loveliness. Tnere is not much
sign of civilisation, is there?"
"Ye see the smoke a-rising over yonder
point in th' distance, sir? That’s where
’tis. That's Sydney Cove, round the point—
and over there '
"Mister Bultitude!" roared the captain.
"Sir?"
"Don't stand chatterin' there.” The cap-
tain was a little put out by the attitude
of Captain Hill. "Must I attend to th’
whole dam’ ship? Away for'ard wl’ ye, an’
see to the anchors. An' liven y’self, see—
liven y’self.”
The mate departed, and Captain Hill
lowered his telescope and looked annoyed,
lie paced to and fro with the glass under
his arm. and his hands clasped behind his
back. Presently he halted and turned
towards the captain as if, having made up
his mind to it. he was about to say an
unpleasant thing that had to be said.
“Captain Twopenny.”
Affecting not to hear, the. commander of
tin* Surprise studied the binnacle.
. "Sou'-west be south,” he growled. "Keep
y'r eyes open, can't ye?”
Captain Hill walked slowly across the
deck. Captain Twopenny turned his back
on him and looked over the stern-rail.
When at length he turned he found the
officer confronting him.
"Sir.’ said the soldier coldly, "I desire
to say a few words to you.”
"Damme, will they not keep? They’ll be
puttin’ her about directly, sir. Well, what
is it—if you must?”
"I was merely going to observe. Captain
1 wopenn.v, that I have drawn up a report
for the Governor upon our voyage, which
I intend to hand to his Excellency the
moment I set foot ashore.”
"Dli, ye have, have ye? Well, we’ve had
a very good voyage—better than might have
been. Mister Hill. A good voyage, so
we have. I’m almost sorry 'tis over."
Captain Hill shuddered.
“My God!” he said. "How you can stand
there and say such a thing passes—passes
my understanding, Captain Twopennv.
Heavens above, was there ever such a voyage
made ! Was ever such mortal misery seen
in any ship? Why. a seventh of those un-
happy wretches in the ’tween-decks are dead,
•and the living are in a most deplorable con-
dition. A good voyage?”
"Yes, sir, a good voyage. What have I
hi do with th’ convicts? They’re Dr.
►Sawkin s charge—an’ yours, sir. The navi-
gation o’ th’ ship’s my ou’y look-out. I
can t help th’ dam’ varmints dyin’. can I?
I ain’t their nursemaid!”
“You have had everything to do with the
bad treatment of the unfortunate prisoners,
sir. You provisioned the ship with vile and
putrid stores, too foul for pigs to swill in
their troughs; and even of this offal you
have cheated the poor wretches of their
allowance.. When the ship was flooded in
the ’tween decks you took no steps to remedy
matters, and they hare been to their bellies
in water for days at a time with not even a
bucket to bail with. They have been bat-
tened down in an atmosphere too stinking
and vile to be described. You have done
nothing for them. And those awful irons,
which you and your owners foisted upon the
authorities—why, the men cannot move their
legs three inches apart without risking
breaking their limbs! A good voyage!”
The captain had taken up his speaking
trumpet preparatory to giving orders to put
the ship about. They were running close
in to Woollahra Point by this time. He
turned savagely on the officer, shaking the
instrument at him.
“Oh, to H—l with ye!’’ he roared. “Ye

leather-neck. Get off th’ poop, d—n
ye! Ye're interferin’ wi' th’ navigation of
th’ shii>. To ll 1 out o’ this, blast ye, ye
v
Captain Hill stepped up to the bully, and
neatly plugged him on the nose. The gross
mass of flesh sat down suddenly upon the
deck in great amazement. When he got his
breath he bellowed ferociously after the
officer, who was descending the ladder to the
quarter-deck: “By God, ye’ll answer for
this, ye son of a . If we was at
sea I’d clap ye into irons. But, by ll—l,
ye’ll answer for it, I promise ye!”
He scrambled to his feet and bellowed into
the trumpet: “Stand by to go about!”
As he went into the cabin, Mr. Bultitude
whispered to Captain Hill: “Thank ye, sir,
thank ye. But me an’ th’ bos’n’s a-goin’ to
lix him—when we get him ashore. He won’t
send ye no challenge.”
“Great Heavens!” remarked Captain Phil-
lip when he read the returns. A stronger
term might have been justifiable.
Nine hundred male convicts had been em-
barked upon the five transports in England.
Of this number ,‘l7O died on the voyage and
450 were landed in Sydney so sick and
emaciated that it was doubtful whether
many of them could be saved. Indeed, a
great number of them died. And this when
the new colony was starving to death ! Truly,
the Governor would have been excusable had
he said “Damn !”
“The irons used upon these unhappy
wretches,” wrote Captain Hill, “were bar-
barous. The contractors had been in the
Guinea trade, and had put on board the
same shackles used by them in that trade,
which are made with a short bolt, instead
of chains that drop between the legs and
fasten with a bandage about the waist, like
those at the different gaols; these bolts
were not more than three-quarters of a foot
in length, so that they could not extend
either leg from the other more than an inch
or two at most; thus fettered, it was im-
possible for them to move but at the risk of
both their legs being broken.... The slave
trade is merciful compared with what I have
seen in this fleet”....
No challenge from Captain Twopenny
came to Captain Hill. For this reason :
Captain Twopenny had gone a-whaling, a
branch of his maritime career with which
he was unfamiliar hitherto. That did not
matter much. They were such experts in
the General Washington, of Boston, that tin-
man who could not learn the technicalities
of the business in the shortest possible time
was a very foolish sort of fellow.
That very earnest man, the Rev. Richard
Johnson, Chaplain to the Colony, had, as
he duly reported, spewed when he descended
to the ’tween-decks of the Surprise, in order
to make the acquaintance of some of his
new parishioners. In various stages of ver-
minous nakedness, smeared with their own
excrement and choking in their stench. 120
moribund monstrosities lay gasping and
groaning in the darkness of the foetid hold.
A chorus of groans, feeble and breathless,
smote his ears. But the stink that polluted
his nostrils was too awful. When his
stomach had finished its protest he had to
be assisted upon deck. And Mr. Johnson
was not squeamish. lie had seen something
of convict transports in his time.
Mr. Bultitude had been in charge of the
first boat that went ashore, and when he
returned to the Surprise he found his friend
the boatswain immediately. That gentle-
man, one Benjamin Billings, awaited him in
the waist.
“Well?” lie inquired, as the second mate
came close to him.
"The luck of th' lucky. Ben ! The very
thing. See the barque over yonder?” he
pointed to an extremely dirtv-looking craft
lying near Dawes Point. “ ’Merican whaler
she is. an' a rough ship. Was a-speak-
ing with her mate. Thev’ll take th’
pig for 50 dollars —Spanish—an’ they’ll he
out 12 months. How much money ha’ ye
collected from th’ crew?”
“That'll be better than payin’ a eonwick
for to knock him on the head.” growled
Boatswain Billings. He pulled a soiled
scrap of paper from his pocket and consulted
it. “Eleven pound four shillin’ an' fi’peuce "
he read out.
Mr. Bultitude made a rapid mental cal-
culation. “Th’ Spanish dollar’s about six
shillings. That’ll be somewhere nigh £l5,
Ben—a h—l of a lot o’ money ! ’Tis worth
it. though. I'll take his sextant ashore next
trip. He'll have no use for it a while to
come. That there mate o’ th’ whaler asked
mo could I lay me hands on such a tiling
he havin’ broke his, an’ one not to be got
for love or money. To-night when he goes
ashore after the women—l know him—’twill
be easy to knock him on the head. I’ll fix
it wi’ that mate. They sail at dawn.”
“’Tis th’ workin’ o’ God’s mercy!” said
the boatswain—a pious man after his own
fashion.
It could not have been that Captain John
twopenny was popular with the crew of the
Surprise. W hat his relationship was w
that of the General Washington there is no
record extant.
“Your Excellency,” said the Chaplain to
the Governor, “I assure you ’twas being in
the midst of the quick and the dead. And
the quick ! ’Twere absurd to speak of
them as such. That shipmaster should he
punished.
“I'll see to it that he is, if things are
as you describe, Mr. Johnson.”
But the harassed Phillip was spared tlih
trouble Messrs. Bultitude and Billings had
attended to it very effectively.
