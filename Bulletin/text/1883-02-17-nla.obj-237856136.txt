Dibbs on “The Dibbs.”
Fob years past the people of New South Wales
u ve been taught to associate a Treasurer's
Budget speech with the idea of a bewildering
jj* of figures. It was Mr. Watson s custom
to*storm the Assembly with a dry and vapid
nalyais of accounts, only occasionally “ fraught,
*,{1! some unmeaning thing he called a thought.’
The task of following tho demonstrator through
hij lecture was too terrible for average humanity.
It involved such punishing discipline in the way
of mental arithmetic, that an Assembly of “ Cal-
elating Boys ’ ’ would have been the only chamber
Impotent to feel an interest in the matter. And,
unluckily, more delioerato examination of these
deliverances failed to reveal, amidst the jangle of
fijures, any clear or explicit principles, any
definite fiscal demonstration, or any original oon-
eeoiion. To Mr. Dibbs must be conceded the
■rodit of having changed all that, flung aside the
bad old precedents, and not only framed his speech
• 8 though he desired that every ordinary citizen
hould be able to understand it, but succeeded iu
that purpose. The Budget speech of Wednesday
last was candid and lucid. These qualities con-
stitute two powerful recommendations. They
furbish in some degree a guarantee that the
Treasurer had nothing he desired to conceal, dis-
tort or obscure ; »nd inferentially that the
Ministry of which he was for tho night the mouth-
piece has made up its mind on a definite policy,
and is not preparing, by a laborious ambiguity,
opportunities for skulking away from its policy
whenever adherence to it might endanger its
tenure of office.
* • *
Lucidity and candour, although excellent things
in themselves, are not sufficient merits to secure
approval for a budget speech. A man may furnish
&u exemplar of candour
and simplicity in his
every utterance and yet
be deficient in sense and
abilities. It is quite
natural and easy to im-
agine a candid idiot, or a
lucid simpleton. _ As
every man of ordinary
oapacity will have easily
comprehended Mr.
Dibbs’ exposition of the
resources and liabilities,
and available income of
the colony, a very broad
public opinion will be
formed as to whether ho
has shown competency
to deal with his theme.
The position which the
Treasurer had to provide
for has been a peculiar
one. The essential and
leading feature of the
Ministerial policy in-
volved the immediate
surrender of receipts ex-
ceeding a half-million
sterling lor tho year.
And, taking a common
sense view of tho p *cu-
liarities of public feeling,
it was incumbent upon
the Government to carry
out the wish of the con-
stituencies for a radical
reform in asriarian uiat-
tsrs without plai ingnpun
tbeoommunity such com-
pensatory burdens a*
would be felt as indi-
vidual grievances. 'J hey

Steadfastly prepared o

for the sake of the re-
forms they advocate. It
has been an indica'ion of

recognised, either

, oixio uia Liny-

remarkable adroitness. He has treated the country

This is not a system of finance. It cannot be
credited as being more than an expedient, and
although Mr Diiies candour did not go the
length . f categorically so describing his plan, he
lajs no claim, we are glad to observe, for his
device, beyond what is due to it as an expedient
calculated to meet the peculiar situation in which,
by the decision of the constituencies, the new
Administration acceded to charge of the ship of
State. Mr. Dibbs’ scheme, briefly stated, is
simple: he proposes to make good the so-called
income from land sales which he surrenders, by
appropriating the surplus accumulated from the
same source. There will be sufficient for two
years. Consequently, tho financial stringency,
which everyone had predicted must be a conse-
quence of the alteration in the land policy of the
country, will be averted, at any rate till that
period shall ha'<e expired. This is undoubtedly
a coup of more than ordinary meri*.. In
two years many things may happen. The
colony will have ample time to turn itself
round and readjust its affairs to meet the changed
conditions Mr. Dibbs, we think, did not make
the most of his case in this respect. Whether he
refrained owing to a determination to confine his
dealings to the plainest, most obvious facta, or
did not perceive the value of the argument, we
have no means of judging. Buthia demonstration,
cheerful as is its tendency, would have been
invested with enhanced brightness had he pointed
out the prospect that, long before the surplus
could be exhausted, tho operation of an improved
Land Law would pour into the Treasury a con-
stant stream of real revenue derived from an
enormous expansion of Iona fide occupation and
alienation of the lands h thorto recklessly sol 1 to,
practically, tho lowest bidder. And had the
Treasurer felt disposed to project his mind into the
future in a sanguine spirit, he might without
extravagance have laid some stress upon the
expansion of genuine and legitimate revenue
likely to accrue through every channel of indirect
taxation, owing to the increase of the proportion
and probably the numbers of actual producers
settled upon the soil, and of the industrial classes
in the cities who minister to the requirements of
those settlors and producers.
♦ * *
Perhaps, however, Mr. Dibbs exorcised a wise
discretion in confining his deliverances to the
maintenance ot confidence, without launching into
flights liable to be challenged as fanciful or over-
sanguine, and the realization of which would
depend in a great degree upon developments of
policy which the Government have not pledged
themselves to undertake. To secure the fullest
benefit of the impending reform in our laws,
a generous and even daring impulse will have to
be given to immigration.
# • #
It can scarcely be hoped, however, that the now
order of land-alienation will be in full work before
the present year has expired. Increase! immi-
gration under present conditions, while all the
avenues by which access to the lands of the colony
are obstructed and barricaded, would merely
crowd the cities with useless population for whom
it would be difficult to find tunployment, and
whose support would unduly add to the burdens
of the handful of real producers, by whom the
community is virtually sustained. It will be time
enough to legislate in support of the new land
system when it has been brought into existence,
and its working tested in some degree. The
principle of doing one thing at a time—but really
doing it— for which the present Ministry has shown
a preference, is not a bad one, and is especially
welcome after the plan of its predecessors to pro-
mise lots of things, and do only such as helped to
keep themselves in office.
• * •
If Mr. Dibbs had effected no more than to
charm away the spectre of monetary tightness
which was being industriously invoked by the late
Ministry, their hangers on, and all persons and
institutions which were profiting by the spoliation
of the country by forced land sales, he might
claim to have won his spurs. But he succeeded
in giving prominence in his speech to features of
the colony’s condition, which, thus published to
the world, cannot fail to bo of infinite service to
us. Keeping in view the disposition of late evinced
by loading organs of public opinion in England to
decry owlonial loans as investments for British
capital, nothing could have been more timely or
more serviceable than the Treasurer’s clear and
incontestable exposition of our true financial posi-
tion. The case was put with admirable lucidity
and telling compactness. The stress laid upon
the fact that not only do our railways pay higher
interest upon their first cost than tho railways of
any other country in the world, but that tho
interest was only calculated after deducting all
charges for maintenance, repairs, renewals, and
alterations, was stress laid exactly in the right
place. And it was especially valuable as an intro-
duotion to what followed: a demonstration that
these railways alone would, if place! upon the
market, noalise sufficient hod only to pay off every
penny of the colony's indebtedness—eighteen
millions—but would realize a surplus amounting
to seven millions starling.
There is just one danger to which the temporary
pressure of circumstances exposes the colony.
The present necessity for charging a number cf
items ot expenditure to surplus revenue account
is apt to create a bad precedent. The cost of
immigration may fairly be charged against the
proceeds of laud sales. But there is no possible
justification, once the balance of yearly revenue
and income is restored to a normal footing, for
separating such items as charitable allowances,
and allowances to Municipalities, Irom the yearly
expenses. Works of a reproductive nature, or
such as being permanent will be handed down to
posterity, may fairly be charged to special ac-
count, whether that be realised capital or loan
funds. But caro is requisite that there shall not
be formed a habit ot charging to any but tho
annual incomings, expenditure which arc really
recurrent, and have to bo met year by year,
♦ ♦ *
Tho result of Mr. Dibbs’ statement, taken as a
whole, has been undoubtedly a revival of confi-
dence within the colony. Should tho loan he pro-
poses, as part of his programme, to ask for
within the next few months, go off well, there is
reason to expect that—unless causes, such as a
European war, entirely extraneous and outside
the range of colonial influences intervene —
there awaits the community, in lieu of the
depression predicted by croakers, disappointed
politicians, and land sharks, a period of prosperity
as yet unexampled. And that this loan will be
readily subscribed, as soon aa Mr. Dibbs’ able
demonstration ot not merely tho solvency but
tho wealthiness of this colony as a State, shall
have had time to operate on the minds of the
moneyed classes in itngland, there seems fair
ground for believing. The moneys of tho
banks will be restored to normal channels, lor
the encouragement of trade and enterprise. In
lien of running a barren circuit from the banks to
the Treasury in exchange for land, and back from
the Treasury to tho banks in the form of surplus
deposits, they will ramify into a thousand minute
rills, spreading fertility over, not a single depart-
ment of investment, but every branch ot industry.
Sham Ideals.
We are sick of tho “ De Mortals ” principle as
misapplied in these days. The newspaper has
taken the place of the
tombstone, and the lying
epitaphs which had for
centuries been the theme
of satirists have given
place to obituary notices
equally false, fraudulent,
and misleading. When
a man’s history is giver,
it suould bo a true oiu.
The presumption is that
it is recounted for the
instruction otthe living.
When a merely lauc-
atory notice is offered,
and the deceased is de-
scribed as possessing ail
the virtues of an angel,
and none of the coui-
tervailing weaknesses cf
a human being, the re-
sult is sheer mischief.

mind, and capable of the
difficult accomplishment
of self-analysis, who know

plan of giving only half of a man’s character is
antagonistic to this most valuable study, falsifies
the records, and diffuses an entirely misleading
and bewildering conception of the moral condition
of mankind.
• ■ •
A glaring example of this tendency was afforded
the other day when the news of Gambxtta’s
death reached Australia. Two Sydney daily news-
papers went out of their way to express an opinion
that the cause of his death should oe “ sunk in
oblivion.” This means simply that the dead
Gambktta, hero and seducer, republican and
voluptuary, should be disguised, and that, in its
stead, a merely fanciful and manufactured
character—all sternness and purity—should be put
on record. In other words, that mankind should
be taught the lie, that the noblest virtues and the
most wretched weaknesses cannot be combined in
one character. Thus deluded, people would be
incapacitated from recognizing the greatness of a
man incidentally weak, or the wickedness of a
man incidentally groat. To teach such falsities is
to play the game of able impostors, and to in-
tensify the miseries of the virtuous but weak.
For our own part, wo do not propose to assist in
huddling up Reality. When a man dies, we will
tell the truth about him ; and we will tell as much
truth about men while alive as the law —perverted
as it is to a protection for rogues and impostors—
will permit us. We are reserving to ourselves the
task of writing the obituaries of some men who,
thanks to the corruption of Justice into mere Law,
are enabled, while living, to hold their hands upon
our throats.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Death in the Pot.”
A matter, which had some little attention paid to it
during the recent general elections, deserves more con-
eideration than it would seem to have got either from
candidates or electors. It is the question of applying
safeguards by administrative action against the adul-
teration of food. The need for such proceedings is very
great, and it is chiefly in the interests of the poor and
the ignorant that such a matter should be attended to.
Take one instance out of many which may be cited—
that of the quality of our tea importations. The tea
which Is imported into this colony may be a reasonably
well-preserved article of food, and it may not. There
are qualities of tea sold in this city by all classes of
grocers, at Is. 6d , 2?, and even less, per lb , which
yield the seller a profit, and paralyse the digestive
organs of the consumers; which is no very great
wonder, when we remember the description of the
commoner qualities of tea, given in a Melbourne paper
a few years back—perished leaves of various kinds,
used tea-leaves and refuse matter dyed, re-dried,
coloured with black-lead and arsenical pigments, and
loaded with scrapings of walnut shells, and so on. For
all the notice our laws take of the transaction, a “ son
of commerce,” verdant or otherwise, may any day land
a cargo of this material, store it, label it “ choice
congou, souchong, nulong,” and the rest, and sell it,
whence it goes into consumption, to bo the fruitful parent
of indigestion, and other plagues of humanity. It be-
hoves the poor to take note of t b is, for they almost exclu-
sively consume these frauds. Again, a vast quantity of
vegetables and fruit is retailed by dealers through the
more densely peopled and therefore poorer suburbs,
which are unfit for human food. Now all this sort of
thing can be effectively dealt with. They have dealt
with it pretty effectively at home, and nearer, in Vic-
toria. Why not here ? Not, God knows, because there
is no need. It is because the people are apathetic. To
he sure the Government could not deal with every form
of this great evil, without assuming a censoriousness
distasteful to English prejudices. Adulteration can
only be put down when the most proj adiced people in
the community—house-wives—learn that a meal of
thoroughly sound, well-cooked food is more valuable
than any amount of money saved by the purchase of
inferior articles, and the use of improper utensils and
neglect of due preparation of victuals. They do not
seem on the high road to learn this at present. But the
G ivernment can prevent the grosser frauds. It can
appoint Inspectors to gauge the quality of bread, of
m ? at at the abattoirs, of vegetables at tha market, and
of imports in bond. There is a dilletante attention now
paid to the sanitation of homes and workshops. Would
there were some attention paid to the sanitation of
hum in stomachs. We should be a less dyspeptic and
c msequently a happier people so. There is a sufficiently
drastic Adulteration of Foods Act in the St a tut 3 Book.
It is time it were made operative by definite action.
Honour and Gats-money.
In a recent Echo an article appeared bearing upon the
cricketing contest just finished at Moore Park, and on
the devotion to field sports generally exhibited by
colonials. It proposes the question whether this
devotion is useful or harmful, and leans to the former
conclusion. We may concede at the outset that cricket
is a fine game, that well played it is a source of genuine
pleasure, and that its practice within judicious limits
will tend to make the race more athletic, more healthy,
and consequently more beautiful. But the gist of the
controversy lies in the moaning which can fairly be
attached to the words “judicious limits.” If the only
limit to the practice of cricket should come to be the
exigencies of the weather, who shall say that the state
of things then arising] will be either beneficial or
creditable ? It is desirable that our people be a healthy
people, and to this end gymnastics in their most usual
form with us, namely, field sports, cricket, foot-ball,
and so forth, have a very distinct tendency. But are
the claims of the intellect to be quite stunted that the
claims of the body may be the more largely satisfied ?
To those who think it is both necessary and profitable
that the claims of mind and body should be fairly met,
the extent to which field sports occupy the attention of
colonial youth is a discouraging feature. There is not
a plot of unoccupied ground, moderately flat, in Sydnej
or its cut irons which is not oceupied on Saturday or
holiday afternoons with crowds of amateur athletes.
The truth is that education has small hold on the
youth of these colonies after they leave school. Thej
‘ let Eucx.id pause and Archimedes rest” with severe
whole-mindedness. But it is difficult to look upon the
professional cricketing element with any degree of
complacency, maugre the Echo. Is cricket a noble
game, or a skilful occupation? When we see men,
Civil Servants and others occupying good positions,
resign or obtain leave of absence for periodical cricket-
ing tours, when we witness their vulpine appetite for
gate-money, trophies, testimonials, and lucre in all
forms, we may doubt the 11 noble game” theory. The
height of a cricketer’s ambition used to be to play in an
intercolonial eleven. Now it is that the game-money
may be big. Facilis descensus Aver nil
Scrip and Staff—and " Sugar.”
Wk have before us a piece of a curious little handbill.
The date and address are torn off the top, so we can
form no idea of whence it came and when it was printed.
We take it to be a translation of a cuneiform inscrip-
tion, as it solely concerns a little sacerdotal send-off
which could have no interest Whatever to the laity. It
is to the effect that a number of priests—of Baal, pro-
bably-gathered together and decided to present the
Archpriest, who was about to leave Assyria on a tour to
Thebes of the hundred gates, with a purse of shekels
and an address. Further down, it mentions that several
large sums of money were at once “ enthustically ”
subscribed for this object. This little document throws
a strange light on the inner mysteries of an ancient
religion. We see that, in those days, priests were
wealthy—not vowed to poverty as they are now—and
could afford to testimoniilise one another with money
they had wrung out of their congregations under
various pretences and in various ways, from the ad
misericordiam appeal to the pity of the pious, to the
anathema against the bedevilled devotees who would
not “part” with sufficient promptitude. By a strange
coincidence, fully two-thirds of the names of this
pries oly subscription list have a decidedly Milesian
ring. Probably the ancestors of the present Irish
priesthood were in demand for The church in those
days, because they had good largo mouths to curse with.
How thankful we should be that we live in days when
religion is disinterested, and its expounders work only
for the good of man and the glory of God !—when priest
and prelate are alike humble and earnest in the service
of souls, and stalk not ab mt in purple and flue liaeu—
in broadc’oth and stiff stocks ! We are very thankful
And, by the way, this reminds us that Archbishop

Tenderers’ Troubles
The B mdi Sewer, for which tenders are invited,
is a” very large work, and its cost will run to a
big sum of money, counting by thousand . To se-
cure economy, tenders are invited throughout Hit
colonies; and, to protect the colony against dummy
offers, cash depos ts are required to accompany
every tender. But, admirable as this is in theory,
it can be made to work very differently in prac-
tice. Contractors from Naw Zealand or Victor a can
bo held at arm’s length, and the allotment of the wor-
insured to a comfortable ring if local tenderers who
maintain agreeable relations with the Works’officials,
by very simple expedients. The stranger can ba refused
a copy of the specifications unless he bring a letter of
introduction from some local person whom the Depart-
ment in its wisdom chooSaa to regard as sufficient
warranty. He can be asked if ho is bona-fide, and gener-
ally badgered and repelled until he becomes impressed
with the idea (erroneous, no doubt) that the officials
regard him with disfavour as an interloper, and that
even if he persist and overcome the preliminary ob-
strnctions, his chances of fair play are not worth
reckoning on. A man’s tender may be accepted, and
the very acceptance be made a misfortune to him, if
there be a disposition to pick quarrels with himself and
faults with his work. Naturally, when an intending
tenderer perceives that ho is bluffed on making his pre-
liminary enquries, he is apt to conclude that ho is re-
garded as a disturber of agreeable arrangements, and
likely to be treated as such to the bitter end.
Once imbued with this conviction, he concludes that
he will be most discreet by withdrawing alto-
gether, and the radius of competition being
thus narrowed, local men have better oppor.
tunities for a “ knock out,” whereby big prices pre-
vail, and the country is made to pay through the nose.
No business man, desirous of securing economy in his
undertakings, would repulse intending tenderers. He
would at the outeet make everything as agreeable and
easy for them as possible, and institu'e inquiries re-
aped ing their standing and responsibility in a quiet
way. We are informed that in connection with the
Bondi Sewer Contract, the Works Department takes a
different course. To deal only with local contractors
of known reliability, would, no doubt, save the Depart-
ment a good deal of trouble. But it is not maintained
to live in ease. Its business is to take all sorts of
trouble, in order to secure the utmost economy which
can be coupled with efficiency. Every tenderer not
already on the black books should be encouraged; and
it unnecessary difficulties are placed in the way of
strangers, the officers who so forget themselves should
be brought to a sense of their duty.
According to Mr. Campbell, M.L.A., every member
jf the present Government has received a letter from
one or other of the monetary institutions, warning him
not to interfere with the Land Laws t If it be true
that the banks have departed from their true functions
to this extent, they are but laying the foundation of a
bursting-up agitation beside which that headed by Mr.
Berry in Victoria would be as child’s play. The direc-
tors of Sydney banka are for the moat part bumble-
beaded old fossils who have made their money by work-
ing the oracle in rings which are only possible in the
absence of a large population and a strong public
opinion, and imagine it will be feasible to oontinno the
operation until the end of time. Corruption in Victoria
was not nearly as old nor hod it so much of original sin
at the bottom of it as the rottenness which pervades
New South Wales. When the bursting-up day does
come here, what a terrible reckoning there will be for
every man who has made money by bis opportunities
for plunder, instead of by dint of honest ability 1
If came very ill from Mr O’Connor to raise an outcry
because reasonable humanity has been dealt to a couple
of sick Chinamen. Mr. 0 Connor is a particularly
demonstrative professor of a Christian faith. He made
himself prominent only the other day in helping to
provide a fat purse (of other people’s money) for a
High Priest. Yet, like many other loud professors, he
aeems quite insensible to the spirit of the religion he
parades. If ever there was a close application of the
arable of the Good Samaritan, the case of these
Chinese —members of a race against whom a bitter
prejudice prevails—furnishes one. The Samaritans
were regarded by the Jews with precisely the same
disfavour as is popularly felt for the Chinese in this
colony. It was that fact which gave point to the
parable. But, apart from this, as an Irishman Mr.
O'Connor should have held more liberal views. His
own race has suffered constantly from just the sort of
supercilious contempt and injustice as the Chinese
now undergo. The legend, “ Ho Irish need apply,”
disgraceful to everyone who ever used it, should have
taught every Irishman a lesson of charity and liberal
feeling. All men with true love for justice must hold
in abhorrence any sentiment which would deny to a
single suffering human being a tender consideration,
merely because he belongs to an alien race.
IS the Postmaster-General aware that the Sydney
postmen, through the intolerant impudence of some
miserable unstrapper, are labouring under a meat
unjust accusation ? Ths pockets were recently out out
of their trousers on suspicion that that’s where the
money want which was stolen from letters in the Post
Office The real thief turned out to be a well-connected
rascal who basked in the sunshine of official smiles and
influence. Tke pockets to those trousers have never
been restored. These postmen, whose honesty has
stood the test of years of trial, were brutally insulted
when the thieving was going on. About fifteen of them
were called np. Said the official flunkey before whom
they were supposed to stand and tremble : “ Among
you lot of postmen is the thief I know it." Some of
these old men staggered and even wept under such a
damnable insnlt. Had one cf them been unfortunate
enough to have stolen the money, would the Minister

is that that the Parratrat'a newspapers are so if eo
oMiged to crowd out important news while at the same

out” is only a pleasint little fiction, and there is no

tion of its inhabitants to the contrary, is not as
large as London, and you can’t therefore, expect a

politics alone. You need not be deluded into the belief
that because you are an aes you must necessarily be a
politician. We have known politicians who were not
aesea. They were ass diivers. Anyhow, your query

as “the sort of question which often comes without
any other apparent reason than the faculty of speech,
and the not knowing what to do with it." “ J.H.”

The expression “ respectable lady " is perfectly correct.
Anyhow, it ought to be, for only the other day, in a

Mortimer, the editor of the London Figaro,
is not what you might well call a man of winning ap-
pearance. He is short of stature, big-headed, pug-
nosed, hard-mouthed, and cruel-eyed; in fuct, a very
desirable man not to know. But he is undoubtedly
clever. His paper is not particularly bright, but it is
readable A similar criticism applies to his plays—of
which he has written numbers, cbnzBy adaptat ions from
the French, 'they are not strikingly brilliant, but
they are passable. Years ago, when Henry Irving the
actor was making his name, Mortimer and he were fast
friends But M ortimer wanted to mould Irving accord,
ing to his (Mortimer's) own idea of art, and to present
him to the public as his own protegS This did not suit
the idiosynctacy of Mr. Henry Irving, who objected
to being looked upon as raw material, to be worked up
into any arbesque Mr. Mortimer might fancy. So
there was a split between them, and Irving was very
roughly censured in Figaro. But by this time his
success was secure, and he could afford the luxury of
revenge. On the next “first night" at the Adeiphi,
Mortimer sat in one of the boxes. The admirers of
Irving caught sight of him, and hooted him until he
bad to make his escape to the dress circle. But he
found no peace there, so he desperately plunged into
the stalls —the very worst place he could have go re to
—from whence he finally fled clean out of the theatre,
to au accompaniment of hisses, jeers, and groans
Since then, he has been twelve months in gaol over
Mrs. Weldon’s little affair. He is the sort of man wh o
would be exceedingly popnlar on a desert island.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Madeline Smith, the poisoner, who, after leaving
England, lived in Qaeentdand, is now in New Zialand.
She is married to —a lord. No, not to a lord, but to a
briokmater.
Mr. C. H Hunt, the capable young artist whose
initials are so familiar to the readers of The Bulletin',
goes home by the Cuzoo to-morrow (Friday). Ho
hopes to study for a few years, and then return to Aus-
tralia.
Kate Vaughan, it is stated by several New Zea-
land papers, will shortly visit the hot lakes of
Rotomahana Prom this we infer that the lakes will
shortly bo oven more popular than at present among the
bald-bo«ded. Also that Kate isn’t yet tired of being in
hot water.
Arabi’s trial cost =£1,000, and Mr. Blunt has to
pay the bill. England declines. It seenjs Arabi’s crowd
don’t “ hold it " Perhaps then, after all, Arabi was a
patriot. Looking at horn') we don’t know anv man in
Sydney who has bled for his native or adopted land who
couldn’t raise that. But we know any number who
wouldn't.
It will interest many of our lady readers to learn
that Madame do Lessens is about to present the Baroa
with another of those little gifts with which she has
been so regular. This will make seven. And M. de
Laaieps is getting on for 8). This perhaps, comes of
residing so much in Egypt. Something in the Pyra-
mids perhaps.
The wife of Prince Ferdinand (“Bomba”) of
Naples, n 6e Penelope Smyth, is a Waterford girl, and
when the Prinoo married her, she was surpassingly
beautiful. She is aunt-in-law to the wife of rx-King
Amadeus’ wife, and sister to the Empress of Austria.
• she is very simple in her habits, dross, etc., so it is
not improbable that not unfrequently in bombazine
will be the wife of Bomba seen.
The inhabitants of Stoneleigh recently turned
out to welcome the Hon R. Leigh, 5th Hussars, on his
return from the gory struggle. This is Parkes’s birth-
place, and in memory of him the handle, it is said, keeps
one of Sir Henry’s shoos looked up in the sexton’s tool
chest, and shows it to visitors at a penny a time. When
that beadle has shown it a few more years, he hopes to
be able to buy a shoe for himself, and than he can wear
the pair.
Mr. A. K. Finlay and his wife (daughter of Sir
Hercules Robinson) are on a tour up the Nile. They
are accompanied by a few friends, and the party are
supplied with a body-guard of forty “reliable” Arabs.
Some of these Arabs are doubtless a« villainous as the
“reliable” guard supplied to the Palmer expedition
partv, through whose instrumentality they were
carefully conducted—to death.
A cure was, the other day, advertised on Milner
Stephen’s behalf, and an Auckland lady, suffering from
paralysis, wrote to the person whose name aopeared in
the “testimonial,” for particulars. The lady replied,
saying that Mr. Stephen had never cured her, and that
she never signed the thin? at all. If this be true, there
is only one word for it. Let’s am—what’s the word ?
Oh (Word eliminated. —Ed. B.]
A certain noble English Viscount, who di-
vorced his first wife and then sought to touch
up his tarnished escutcheon with the wealth of
Miss Mickay, daughter of the American millionaire,
has got delightfully snubbed. The young lady declined
the pr< ffared honour, and, in doing so, announced
ngain her intention of only marrying an American.
Gossip lovers are, however, much exercised over the
fact that she omitted to fix the data.
Lord Charles Scott (a son of the Duke of Bue-
clench) late commander of H.M.S, Bacchante, returned
to Victoria by the Siam, to fulfil his matrimonial en-
gagement with Miss Ryan, daughter of Mr. Ryan, of
ihe well known southern firm of Ryan and Hammond.
The wedding, which will be a very smart affair indeed,
will take place at Sunbury, at the residence of Mr —we
beg the pardon of the old nobility. Sir William —Clarke,
Baronet, who is related to the bride.
Mr. W. H. L. X. Y. Z. Brown, Government
Geologist of South Australia, after spending a fort-
night over the work, has produced a report on the
Bird-in-hand line of reef at Woodside which, though
deoidely favourable, is fo mea.gr* that the public can’t
sec it 1 It is a fact that, Bray being absent, Cntt, the
Lands Commissioner, a provincial nobody, and Glyde,
the Treasurer, a great old foozle, gave as a reason for
vexatious delay in publishing Brown's report, < hat they
were “afraid it might create a mining furore."
Among the passengers by the Californian mail
steamer Australia, which arrived in Sydney on Friday
night, were Dr, Morris, the well-known physician, and
Mrs. Morris, who for the last eighteen months have
been making a tour in Europe and America. The good-
natured doctor, whose last place of s‘ay was Waiwora
hot springs, N Z,, where he was literally besieged by
people anxious to interview him professionally, has
seen all the flights of all the hospitals and ardently
pursued his favourite study of microscopic science. His
return to Sydney is heartily welcomed.
The Duke of Manchester has severed hia con-
nection with the Canadian “land enterprise.” The
English immigrants who were induced io go out fo the
Dominion by the glowing accounts of the rich “North
West" have suffered much, and many thrifty English
speculators have been ruined. The country whoso rich-
ness was so widely proclaimed, turned out to be “un-
productive and inhospitable." The Duke might with
more credit to himself have retired earlier In these
colonies, ho proved himself to be, commercially, the
rankest of outsiders.
Just about a fortnight ago there oumo to
Hanson's— not to Roseby’s, mind you, — monumental
yard, near the Australian Club, in company with some
other etiigies whieh. we have not yet seen, a life-sized
statue ot Sir Henry, the extinct Dictator. It is a good
likeness, executed, not in statuary, but in Sicilian
marble, the material of which the figures scattered
about the Gardens are for the most part composed.
Parkes, together with the rest, has beau carefully put
away (and concealed) in a corner of the yard. We
always knew Parkas was of Sicilian, not of statuary,
marble. A tombstone yard is a very appropriate place
for his effigy now.
The late Archbishop of Canterbury, when a boy,
was in a lawyer’s office in Edinburgh. While there he
conducted himself with so much demure dignity that
his associates prophetically nicknamed him “ The
Bishop.” Also he used to have fried bread with slices
of cold pork for lunch. And he was a prodigy at por-
ridge-eating. Very early in life he developed such a
decided paunch that his pious parents recognised it as
a sign that he had a “ call ’’ for the church. And a lot
of other things. The sentence beginning with “ also ”
and those that follow are apocryphal We don’t know
anything about the matter, but we thought, we would
just put, thorn in for the sake of colour. This is the
way to write biography—when the subject is dead.
A good yarn— a fact — is told of Joe Raphael of
Sydney in connection with architecture. Every building
the old Hebrew erected, bora the legend, “ Joseph
Raphael. Anno Domini 1863.” or whatever it might bo
“Are you a Jew, Mr. Raphael?’’ one day inquired
a friend. “ Well, I think so,” ho replied. “ Then,
why do you have * Auno Domini ’ stuck up there ?”
Joe was overcome with shame. “Anno Domini be
d d." and an hour later he had It chiselled out.
The “1863” remained No“A.D.”ever subsequently
appenred on his buildings, but with more guile than
was Jewish, he always allowed the four figures to ap-
pear.
According to a private letter received in Sydney,
Bradlaugh hafl hit upon a clever expedient to get into
the House ot Commons this session. On the last occa-
sion, when arriving at the entrance with the avowed
determination of forcing his way, he was met at the
door by half a dozen well-known prize-fighters, whose
services had been specially retained to throw him out—
a very decorous proceeding on the part of the “ first
gentlemen in England." madlauvh, who is a courage-
ous man, made a fierce resistance, and left his mark on
Rome of the hired ruffians, but ho himself received
injuries from which he has not since recovered. Brad-
laugh’s forthcoming expedient has the sanction of law.
Any ten men have a right to petition the Honse of Com-
mons in person. Almost every city, town, and village
in England is now petitioning for Bradlaugh’s admis-
sion. and the thousands of men who will go in posses of
ten to make their request, will represent the bone and
sinew and also the under-jaw of England. Bradlaugh
will, probably, bo admitted.
Some weeks ago there died in St. Vincent’s
Hospital one Gustavns Hirch. Ho was a kind ot
Thorean in his war. Ha was Registrar of the
Supreme Court ot Queensland at one time, a posi-
tion which he lost in a curious fashion. It seems
he was educating three kangaroo pups, and he
left thorn in a pile of title deeds one day and went out.
Whan be came buck, the pups had made a thorough
digest of agrarian literature. They had eaten the deeds.
After this Gustavus retired to Stradbroke Island, where
he lived like a hermit. He was a man of considerable
scientific attainments, and was a marvellous snake-
tamer. If his ability in this line had only been known
soon enough, he might have been specially retained by
the Rum office. [ This is irrelevant—go on with your
anecdote —Ed. B ] He would rise up from his oouoh,
when anybody called on him, covered with reptiles.
His power over animals was wonderful. Whenever he
called them, the wild birds would flutter down and perch
on his shoulder. Birch was a failure, yet for all that
he attained the great end of life as well as most. He
died. And so all Is said.
Tho founder and first editor of La Eevde de
Deux Mondes, M, Buloz, was, as is well-known, a most
eccentric man, his whole life and energies being devoted
t> nnd wrapped up in the Revue. He married, soon
after tho publication became a success, the daughter of
M. Cnstil Blaze, and, as his father-in-law could not bo
brought to think that there was nothin? in the world
worth talking or thinking about save the Revue, the
relations between the latter and his son-in-law were
somewhat constrained. One day, however, on return-
ing home M. Buloz found madams, his wife, in tears,
and was told, in answer to his inquiries, that her father
was dead. Buloz did not say a word, but his counte-
nance fell His head gradully sank on his breast, and
he seemed boned in thought, till at last he said, half,
reproaohfully, to hia wife, “ Isabelle, your father has
alway* been a source of trouble to me whilst living, and
now he has gone and died on the 12th, which will
oblige me to go to his funeral on tho 21th, when, as ha
well knew, we publish the Revue I It is just like
him!”
Mudgee’a senior member, alias “ Tho Giraffe,”
though scarce twenty-six years of age, is not unknown
to journalistic fame. When he and his old chum,
George Coleman, threw off their school aprons, they
divided the honours of “country correspondent ** to
Granny, the Hekker, the Alfred, the Mickey, and
other sheets. Whenever nows ran short, * The
Giraffe " invariably invented a murder or fatal accident
in the back b'ooks, and the youngsters raked in a penny
a lino for it. They were subsequently the first editors of
the Mudgee Independent, a paper which at once jumped
to the front, and Las maintained the lead ever since.
Avain 11 The Giraffe." Haven years ago he entered the
office of a solicitor at Mudgee as an articled pupil Un-
fortunately for his aspirations ot the Chief Justiceship
or “ Wholesome Fun " notoriety, his taste for literary
pursuits now manifested itself, and he stepped down
from his ©fine stool to gratify it. The other day he
entered the political arena against that solicitor—his
quondam master—as a candidate for the representation
of his native town, and outdistanced him by 1300 votes 1
The much-travelled R. S. Srnythe was at latest
in Auckland, N.Z., chaperoning Archibald Forbes,
whose opening night in that city was a decided success
R S. S. was on two recent occasions observed to wear
in private an air of slight melancholy—a circumstance
attributed by those In the confidence ot his paternal
aunt to an adventure which some time ago befel him in
tho wonderland of New Zealand—the Rotomabana
countrv He had for travelling companions a charming
young Englishwoman and her brother, who had just
arrived. She took off her boots and stockings prior to
entering her canoe in which a lake was to be crossed,
and entrusted them to the Maories who had charge of
her baggage. Bat when the party reached their destina-
tion the boots and ptockings had disappeared. What was
to be done I The much-travelled came to the
fore at once. Of course he had a pair ot slippero to
spare, and equally as a matter of course they were at tho
lady’s service “ Thank you—so kind of you Mr. Smythe
—I hope you are reallv able to up are them" —and so on.
But Ihe shoes weren't big enough for the fair creature. She
couldn’t even get them on, alter the much-travelled,
prompted by that noble spirit of self-sacrifice which
guides him alike at Ballarat and Berlin, had out the
heels down with a penknife. This is why R. 3, 8. has on
two distinct occasions worn a pensive air.
The conversion of Sir Tatton and Lady Sykes to
Roman Catholicism means the verification of the dream
ot the volatile Lothairin Lord Baaoonsfleld’y work. Sir
Tatton has signified his conversion by granting a quarter
of a million to the erection of the great Catholio Cathed-
ral of Westminister ; thus ensuring for the R. C’s the
two flaest edifices in the great capital, the second being
Brompton Oratory. Sir Tatton Sykes has built fifteen
Protestant churches in Yorkshire. It is to be hoped
this last aob will not uudo his previous work. One of
the Loudon papers observes This going over to
Rome of Sir Tatton Sykes and his wife is the most itn-
uortant event of the kind that has occurred since the
M irquis of Ripon became a * vert.’ According to the
new Doomsday-book, Sir Tatton owns a rant-roll of some
£36,000 a year in the East Biding of Yorkshire nl me.
Sir Tatton inherited this magnificent property in 1861 ;
and some eleven years afterwards surprised his friends
by marrying the elder of Mr. Cavendish-Bentinck's two
daughters, the lady being his junior by nearly a quirtor
of a century. It was, however, a * marriage of affinity,’
as mav be judged from the fact that it is with one
aooord the happy pair have embra ed the 'old faith.’
The three properties of Lord Harries, Sir Tatton
Sykes, and Lord Ripon, now placed in Roman Catholic
hands, will together, constitute a stretch of country
extending from Beverley on (ho east to the borders of
Lancashire on the west, in the finest district in Eng-
land." Another London prist takes a diffjreut view of
tho importance ot the affair, observing that tho ” con-
version of a. baboon would have been of equal moment.”
The convention of Bill Sykes might have been.
The Grand Duchess Vladimir of Russia is in
disgrace She wrote a letter from St Petornburg to a
lady in Paris, in which she nicknamed all the Russian
Court ladies—calling them tho eat, the mouse, the glow-
worm, the toad, &o. Of course the letter was inter-
cepted at the cabinet noir, and tho Emperor and Em-
press are in a great rage. Talking of the Russian Court,
it would seem the people who belong to it console them-
selves for their enforced seclusion verv much in tho
way the gallants of the rdgime of Loos Quinze did. The
stories of the domestic proclivities of the present Em-
peror are now stated to be “ ad bosh." He was a patron
of Hortense Schneider (the original Grand Duchess),
unbent to Madame Theo, nnd would have subsidised
Patti,but for the latter’s infatuation ot Nioolini. Before
the old man got blown up, he was very giddy also and
expressed much admiration for the singing ot Marie
Bozo. On hearing this, yonng Gye. her hnsband, eloped
with her by the night mail. He did not oare to put his
faith in princes. The late Emperor’s favourite plan was
to engage the hotel where a star he fancied was stop-
ping, and station a big chasseur in the hall Then when
people drove up to engage rooms, they would possess
themselves ot tho situation, and go away whistling. Ha
gave Aimee alone £12.000 worth at diamonds besides
a solid gold soeptiie—in one sea*on. And all this time
the peasantry was starving, and poor prisoners were
being murdered iu Siberia. So he was blown up. A nd
then tho 8.M. Herald wrote an article saying how
good a monarch ho was, and old Piddingtonsky de-
fended his memory in the House. Ho is now in—
Heaven.
Much fusa in Adelaide just now over the Sower
and Water basinosi'ea. Oswald Brown, a hydraulic
engineer, who bossed both departments, departed from
South Australia with a complicated deep-drainage
scheme only half-exocnted. He says ho loft ample
instructions for completion. 'The public are sceptical
as to whether this could be possible, and only know
that the city is now devoured by stinks. A more than
ordinarily atrocious stench is called an “Oswald
Brown.” One of Oswald’s subalterns wos Arthur Lung-
ley. a handsome younggentlomau who considers blmstuf
eminently fitted for Oswald’s vacant billot. Because
a man can make a pretty drawing of a bridge, can he
menceuvre bald-headed stinks? That is the question
which Lungley wishes to answer in the affirmative.
Pe >ple behind the scenes smile a little. They know
well enough that Arthur’s qualifications for the position
ho fills are considerably magnified, and held sufficient
for the particularly simple reason that he married the
daughter of Sir ’Euery Ay. rs. Sir 'Eaery was never a
great politician, and, in fact, never great at anything
since tho old fiddling jig-me jog days, except money-
lending. Yet the colony has been cursed with Sir
’Enery as Cabinet Minister of the fossil type,
nnd he exercises great influence among the local
plutocracy, and, somehow. Sir 'Enory’s son-in-law
met with an nstonisniug amount of otherwise
unaccountable promotion. Still the public will not
j stand this last hinted appointment, because the public
are too directly interested. Breathing, as people at
present breathe at Adelaide, an atmosphere about
three-fouiths “ Oswald Brown's," the question of the
engagement of an experienced sanitary engineer is dis-
agreeably urgent. Arthur Lungley, good fellow,
Cheltenham boy, beautifully moustached, handsomely
featured, and indubitably if lengthily elegant, is beyond
his connection with Sir 'Enery, hardly the man to suc-
ceed the only Brown Possibly enough, though, Sir
’Enery may get tho Government in a corner, as rates
are high in the money-market, and thus accomplish a
job which, despite vested interests, would surely have
to be undone when Parliament meets.
Mrs. Weldon, the lady who got James Mor-
timer, of London Figaro, into gaol for libel, and after-
wards got in herself for accusing her trustees of making
out that she was mad, and trying to shut her up in an
asylum, has just won an action for damages against the
promoters of the Birmingham Musical Festival. Mrs.
Weldon is a remarkable woman, highly gifted, very
beautiful, wondrously musical —and exceedingly crazy.
When Dickens left his house in tho New iioad, Mr. and
Mrs. Weldon took it, and there entertained Gounod,
the composer, during the Franco-Germ an war. Quar-
rels, however, sprang up between Mr. W. and hii wife,
and they separated—Mrs. Weldon still continuing to
reside at tho house. Gounod likewise; but it was
?enerally understood (and is now admitted) that the
riendship between them was of a strictly musical and
platonic nature. A row with Gounod was the next sen-
nation, he accusing her of hiding portion of the score of
an oratorio. After this, Mrs. Weldon established a
singing class, and her pupils’ performances were in
great request. She made a deal of money, too, but as
she conducted her establishment very much on the
Mrs. Jellaby-priuoiple, she was always hard up. It
appeared that this eccentric lady brought Mr. Weldon a
considerable dot, but after the separation, he declined to
•• part." Countless people subsequently (including tho
highest in the land) interested themselves in her, but
all to no purpose. When one point was gained for her
she wanted another, and it generally ended by her friends
getting a “ turn" all round before they wore done with
her. Mrs. Weldon’s articles in Figaro, signed by her-
self, were extraordinary productions—In some portions
exhibiting shrewd common sense, in some a ready wit,
but in others a peevish and amateurish style that made
the sketches painful to peruse. Mortimer suffered his
imprisonment in Holloway, as a first class misdemean-
ist; Mrs. Weldon in Newgate. She, however, only
served halt her sentence—three months, while Mr.
Mortimer put in the whole of his half-year. It is said
that after the first week of Mrs Weldon’s incarcera-
tion, tho Princess of Wales seat to her and stated that
if she would promise not to further annoy people,
influence would be exerted to get her immediately
released. Mrs. Weldon, however, declined. She is
ti ported to have said she would “ die in prison and
si a me her persecutors." She apparently forgot all
about dying, later. Women often do.
Alexander Tolmer’s book, entitled “ Reminia-
c moes of an adventurous ana chequered career at
Lome and at the Antipodes," has rescued Adelaide, and
j, a y make an uncomfortable sensation in some quarters.
T ao old man organised the gold escort in the early days;
captured, single-handed it necessary, any bushrangers
wanted; had served with General Bacon in Portugal;
ti rled with Lady Charlotte (she was the original of
i yr-n’s ** lanthe," by the way, and had "Childe
Harold" dedicated to her) at Government House;
r used a brood of big, handsome, athletic, raffish boys;
married afresh at sixty, and is now busy begetting a
n,vv family; is clearly a victim of Governmental in-
j istice, holding only an unimportant sub-inspeotorship;
and makes use of his newly-published volume to say
some very straight things regarding many magnitt-
oos For instance, pp 279 and 28'J vol. ll, Tolmer
says:—“ I was suddenly removed, at great loss and
expense, to do duty in the south-east. . . This re-
moval was caused . . through the influence of tho
late H. K. Hughes, aud that of his brother, E. C.
Hughes, S.M , having been brought to bear against me,
in consequence of having taken action, in the execution
of my functions as ranger, against some men in their
employ, who wore illegally felling growing pines on
Crown lands. . . I was afterwards credibly informed
that Mr. H. K. Hughes was heard to say that if ever
he got into Parliament and became Minister of tho
Crown, ha would ruin me. Eventually ho was elected
. . and succeeded in obtaining the Treasurership, and
Very shortly afterwards I received an olfloiai letter from
the Surveyor-General, conveying an intimation by
direction of too lion* tho Ooiumibsioner that tho
Government did not propose to give me more than
one forage allowance. . . Accordingly, from 1870 to
18711 was only in receipt of one, a loss equivalent to
£210, I was always admitted a guest at Government
House, but from the aforesaid date to the present time,
with one exception, I have been discarded from Govern-
ment House through the machina' ions of my enemies.'
Tho H. K. Hughes above spoken of u.ad to declare
himself like in personal appearance to Jesus Christ.
Ho was a pompous, purse-proud sort, who probably
ri«d of self-conceit. Tolmer remarks again, p. 283,
“ Boeing it was proposed to make provision for two
additional inspectors, I applied for one of the positions,
but not having a friend at court, I was passed over, and
as Mr. Justice Boucaut was then in tho Ministry, his
brother, Mr. Ray. P. Bouoaut, was appointed." Tolmer
can’t, couldn’t, and wouldn't kow-tow to tho colonial
oada who were pitchforked into office, and considering
his great and extended eevioes, has been vilely treated
by tho various Ministries. If John Cox Bray wants to
do a popular thing let him provide a sinecure with good
pay attached, and shut the mouth of the plucky veteran
wno, it spared, proposes to bring his “ Reminiscences
much nearer to this year of grace. Talking of Lady
Charlotte Bacon in this paragraph, reminds ns that
this remnant of Byron’s lanthe did most violently
squint and could must bullock-drivorly talk. She
used while iu South Australia, to live at Kent
Town whence, by-the-byo, one son, Edward,
ran away with and married Jffliss Lawrence,
and the other eon, Harley, departed on solitary cattle-
droving expeditions to Queensland. Round Lady
Charlotte’s house thmo w«s a garden, aud from that
garden young larrikins used to steal fruit. Lady
Charlotte missed Ihe fruit, and one afternoon lay in
wait for the thieves nehind the fence. It happened that
her neighbour’s boys and some young friends were
playing cricket in the next allotment. Ahat neighbour
was a high official in tho Post Office, and a prominent
member of tho Wesleyan Church. Presently there was
a cry of “ lost b ill." The ball had been hit into Lady
Charlotte’s garden. Tho neighbour’s son volunteered
to climb over aud get it. He olomb, and dropped right
on Lady Charlotte. She started up aud yelled, I ve
got you at last, you young — 1 If I don’t cart you over
to Sana Baddome’s may I be d —d. ” Beddome is an
able Police Magistrate. “ Come along, you young —.
her ladyship continued, -getting a good grip on the
trembling youngster's sinister ear. She actually
dragged him to Beddome’s house, which was ,.o if, and
insisted that Sam should telegraph for a policeman to
take the “ young " into custody. Beddome knew
tho lad, however, and managed by degrees to convince
Lady Charlotte that her intensely respectable neigh,
hour’s sou was too good a boy to play larcenous tricks.
Alas ! my masters, that Byron’s lanthe should squint
and swear in her old age. But, probably, we all do it.

of the pallid past. His commanding voice is heard no
more calling out to Herman to hand No. 90u a drip-
ping pan:’’ or to “pass over that Dutch oven to the
lady in black.’’ Wo never now stumble over ormolu
tables and Louis Quatorzie mangles in crossing the
mouth of the side-alley at night. There is no sound of
shouting from proud prize-winners bearing home revres
slop bowls or Queen Anne wash-tubs. Even the cheery
noise of the diorama men *' skating for drinks at tne
back is still. Desolation and dust hang over every-
thing But, next week, when, by Jove! Miss Juno
cones with a mbky whey of “twenty-two stars, we
shall forget all this dismalnesa. We hope this gland
total of twenty-two is not acquired by counting the

“ The Silver King,” the great London success,
■will be preduoed here very soon, we are confident. Uur
■oenfideiice always carries us over our ignorance of de-
tails. It is a flue play, and thoroughly original in
style and subject. The text is that noble verso of
Tennyson—
« I hold it truth with him who sings
To one clear harp in divers tones.
That men may rise on stepping-stones
Of their dead selves to h'gher things.
The euthors, H. A. Jores and Henry Herman, are both
clever Lordon litterateurs , and their joint work is ex-
■oeedingly well done Tue plot is something like this :
—Wilfrid Denver, mad with drink nnd losses on the
Derby, is about to ehoot himself. At this moment a
former lover of his wife enters and taunts him He
rushes after the our. threatenii g to shoot him tollows
him to hi« rooms Finds there a gan Wing gang head, d
hy Captain Hubert Sbtnrer, alias " T 1 . e Beider, who
robs in evenii g dress. Denver is chlorcformed. »nd
the man he was in pun "it of r '< mu g m suddenly after,
is shot by Skinm. When Denier wtkes up be sees
the dead body beside him, and, dazed by the diug ho
had taken, concludes that be i* ihe mmderer. Wild
with despair, he flies fro ■ the spot. In the second act,
he bids farewell to bis wife end starts by train to Liver-
pool. Tl-e tiain comes into c ntact in the way with
corns waggons contaixL v pe’rolenm, and is burnt.
He is believed to have peril bed in the ashes.
But ho has not. He sails for America.
Three years and six months are supposed to have
•elapsed before the curtain rises on the thiia act
Captain Skinner lives in a villa. Mrs. Dtnvcr comes to
him to beseech him not to turn her out of the little
•cottage she is living in. He relents, and then repents
■of relenting. She is to he turned out. EnUr Wilfrid
Denver in disguise. He meets his own 111 tie daughter
in the streets, barefooted and almost starving. He
•gives her his purse, telling her to give it to bir mol her.
This purse pays the rent just ss the bailiff is tok ng
[possession of the bhuse. Denver does not reveal him-
self to his wife until he has proved his innocence of the
murdi r of Geoffrey Ware (her former lover) He d-es
"this dexterously by again disguising himself this time
as a daft old man, and frequenting the thieves river-
side storehouse, until he effects an entrance. A quarrel
Arises among ttum lefoie very long, and Skinner is ( x.
.[posed and Denver declared innocent. So nil enriv jey-
dialogue of the play is said to be clever and
and witty, much of the language lofty and poetio. Wo
are glad of this. We don't want any more clap trap
sensation.

There is nothing new to be said about the Gaiety
except that there were fair audiences there all this
week. And this is very new.

Clara Stephenson and poor old Charles Burford
are up in the most remote and broiline North just now,
playing in Shakespearian dramas. The company con-
sist of Miss Stephenson, Charles Burford, Cora MTan,
and TV) r. Wills, Clara's husband. The latter is advance
agent. We are glad of this, because we heard that
when the original company broke up he started by hia
solitary self to make his way down here on a peep-show
performance. We even heard that the peep-show was
an ingenious contrivance of lenses, made out of frag-
ments of a square gin bottle, through which the audi-
ence looked at woodcuts from the Town and Country.
But all gre it men are liable to be slander, d Charles
Burford, by the way, is the backbone of the company.
In “ Hamlet,” and such like trifles, he plavs not only
the principle part but all the others—all the other male
ones. Thus he comes on by one entrance as Prince of
Denmark and questions the gravedigger. Then he
stalks out to come in again at the other entrance as
the gravedigger, and answer his own questions. There
is something about this style of surmounting diffl-
cullies which borders upen genius, but it requires a
very patient audience. Wo should think it would be
most successful in a cemetery. The Clara-Stephenson
Companv propose to go to India next. They can go to
—Hong Kong—for us.

Managers little know what critics hove to go
through for them ! Before going to see “ Henry the
Fifth" at the Koyal, w« thought the matter over, and
remembering that “ Handsome George" always at-
tracts a fashionable audience, we resolved, at all
hazards, that our appearance should do credit to the
glorious profession to which wo belong And then
what a to-do there was 1 The landlady's little girl bad
to be subsidised with a penny to go to Ultimo, carrying
“it” with her in a brown paper parcel, with strict
injunctions to wait while it was being done up. Then
we had to retire temporarily to rest, while the family
devoted its energies to cleaningonr garments with sour
heer; a diplomatic junior member of our domestic
circle, in the meantime, going down armed with
an old circus-order, to interview the landlord cn
the subject of the loan, for one evening, of his “ new
elastics.’’ So as to be in good time—for the show
begins at a quarter to eight—we gave orders that out
bat should be inked at six, and the little boy from next
door having manufactured a oollar-stud for us out of a
piece of white pine with the baker's chisel, things, to-
wards seven, began to look pretty comfortable A
little later, however, our spirits were damped by the
intelligence that the kitten had stolen a sock off the
line, and we were further rendered uneasy by being
informed that the grocer bad refused—in forcible terms
-to allow our oldest to perform the familiar ceremony
of " sticking up" a cake of blacking. Under this com-
bination of adverse circumstances, we did not arrive so
early in oldo England as we should have done—our pro-
gress being further retarded by the ’bus refusing to
pull up when hailed, the driver making a remark as he
passed that “ he didn't want no tin-tags put in the box,
as ho could get plenty of them on his ter backer."

There was a great crowd before the door of the
Home of Harry of England as we entered; and, as we
passed through the mob, we heard doodle refusing in
angry tones to be bribed with cough lozenges to piss
in the Sydney cone-pondent of the Jacki.roo Inteixig.
kmcer hubs,qnently, wa heard that the “ Own
Commissioner' - cf the Amaranq Agriculturist otlerod
Freeman on the stairs ninepence and a water melon to
be allowed to push in, with a similar result. As wo
took our seat in the realms of Kignold, Pistol, Nym,
Bardol.-h, and Dime Quickly were disporting them-
selves before the Boar’s Head, in Easteheap, and Mr.
W. Q. Carey, as the Ancient, was endeavouring to make
the i eople laugh His success in this respect, how-
ever, was considerably hampered by limits. There was
only one guffaw; and this was from the ladv in the
cloak-room, who had just been told by Mrs Polk that
she had found a black beetle in her shoo. Mr. Carey's
Pistol is a singular instance of either a mistaken con-
ceptiou or indifferent study. Either, or both. His
humour is so funereal that you have to look three or
four times on the bill before you can realise the fact
that W.Q. is really playing. Then the mournful cir-
cumstance dawns upon you that he indeed "undertakes"
(hem I) the part. Mr. Carey should improve himself.
He should remember that, in Sydney, people can tee a
funeral for nothing.

Mr. Tolano’s Nym was peculiar. Joe’s idea of
the character seemed to be to delineate a Chinaman
who hod just landed, and was uneasy in his mind be-
cause he had evaded the poll-tax. Nym should be
stolid. Mr. Tolano made him merry and Mongolian.
But, perhaps, Joseph has read some new Shakesperian
commentator, who has proved to his satisfaction that
the Corporal was a native of Canton. In the next
scene we enjoyed ourselves very much; for onr eagle
eye detected Sweeny, feebly disguised as the con-
spirator, " My Lord of Cambridge," and masquerading
in the play-bill under the name of Brown. It was a
touching sight to see those misguided men sentenced
to death by Kignold (who spoke the speech with grand
effect), and to behold them kneeling at the feet of that
monarch, while Harry Vincent from the wings adjured
them to "play light” on the knees of their tights.
Then, when Cambridge rose and went off to his doom,
what a sigh went through the house 1 This effect being
ephanced by the really sad expression of Sweeny’s
countenance ; that gifted actor having been told by
Ryan that Mortyno had hidden one of his Macmorris
shoes. Later on, Mr. S. appeared as Macmorris, and
would have been the “ dead spit ” of that Celtic captain
had he not borne an equal resemblance to Ingomar.
However, he playtd the part with much spirit, and was,
next to Kignold, the biggest success of the piece.
• * •
Oh, and of the piece itself. Well, like those
immortal dramas written by Lewis Scott for the
(tpenesrs, ‘ there's is nothing about it ralcu'ated to
bring a biush to the cheek of maidenly modesty." It's
only Shakespeare and Scott who can do these things,
But there ! the ingenuity of the latter is remarkable.
He is equally successful in writing a drama and mend-
ing n clock. But clever as Shakespeare is, nignold has
improved upon him. George has cut out nine-tenths
of what any one else has to say, and reduced the piece
to twenty-one tableaux vivonis, in three-fourths of which
he is on a rai ed platform flourishing a sword ai d
flooded in lime-light The people lik e this ; especially
the women. We lil e it too : and we really adrmre and
respect hignold. We would admire and respect any
man—gven John Lucas—il he could improve on Shat es-
peare But though the compression is skilful, the
scenery Gordonly gorgeous, and the groupings artistic
beyond compare, thi re are several things in the piece
th»t are a bore T he folding curtain, for instance, is a
bore. It is as ugly as a Bum reporter’s highlows, and
as dingy as the coffin-cloth at a pauper’s funeral. It
only wants an ad. on each side foe “Barker's P g
Plaster" or something to rouse diabolical feelings in the
human heart. T hen Chorus is a bore. We wish to
speak nicely of her lecaute the is Miss Brav brook
Henderson, the lady, at the instance of whom, George
answered “ I will" at the holy altar. I nt wo cannot
afford, having sinned so grievously before our conver-
sion by Mr. David Wall er, to fuitherimperilourrather
shady chances of salvation.
• • •
Well, then. Mrs. Eigrold’a Chorus is a concep-
tion which is, like her bu bend's adupia'ion of ihelute
Mr 8’s drama, pun ly eptefa ular. T here is no mere
poetry in her Chorus than tberv is in ILa-pov dcr. She
can’t sneak the lines eitbir musically er with a pi ro-
rriate gesture. But she can chonje her dress half a-
dozen times, on ere occasion apnearing es Biifaunia,
having apparently been inspired to don (bat raiment
from a If ng end atl entire ccnti mplal ion of the reverse
tide of a bad halfpenny Choms should be young and
hiautiful. Miss Her derson, though the may bebean'l-
fil, is not ycur g. At least wo should say sbe wee over

needs to be said. It is—as Pip remarked of Wopssle’s
Hamlet, “massive and concrete “—one of the finest
performances, perhaps, the ago has seen. We believe
Mr. Bignold will agree with ns in this I He looked very
great; so magnificent, indeed, that all the ladies in the
dress circle were sighing dnring the evening to think
that after the show is over he has to stamp himself into
a pair of “ long quartered town wades.” and struggle
into check 19feh century inexpressibles which only
cost him “ 25 bob.” Mr. Hodson’s Fluellen was a fair
imitation of Fred Thorne’s famous impersonation, but
it lacked both boldness of outline and grasp. Solange
Navaro (why can’t the papers sprll her name right when
she is so nic«y-picey ?) as the Dauphin looked like a
page out of Olivette, but was intelligent as usual It
was a happy inspiration of Allison’s to make the Prince

an idea could only originate in a master mind. We
thank you, James!

Leake has no chance, poor fellow, in a chintz
bedgown as the Constable, and, as the Archbishop, he
was gloomy, so cannot be said to have been in spirits of
mitre. (Ugh!) Mr. H. E. Walton was grand as
Williams, and Harry Bennett appeared rather surprised
to find himself representing the Duke of Orleans. Mr.
C. Mort inn’s Mont joy was a performance that will only
die with him, and we commend him to the attention of
any of onr readers who has a sharp hatohet. But
Charley has talent, all the same. Though he don’t
make much of a Herald, he has the makings about him
of a surpassingly brilliant bellman. The French of
Alice and Catherine (Miss Brayburn and Miss E. Fil
roy) was most excellent Dutch, and George’s own idea
of the Gallic tongae appears to have been inspired by a
Patagonian.

So much for detail. Collectively, the piece is a
splendid success. Everybody ought to see It, if only to
contemplate George’s triumphal entry, and the legs of
one of Mountjoy’s attendants,

Thirty-throe nominations for the Taranaki (N.Z.)
J.C. Handicap, and thirr.y-two nominations for the Can-

Midwinter was born in England But he was
a mere child when he came to Victoria, and learned to
play cricket in Bendigo, where some 15 or 16 rears ago
he and Boyle were the two most promising oolts of the
B.U.C.C.
A most singular thing occurred in the Selling
Base, at the Wellington (N.Z ) races. Hipporina bolting
round the course each time, tbe stewards were unable
to wait any longer, and the race was smarted without
her. Mason and Yallanoe’s Amulet won in a canter.
At Takapnna (Auckland, N.Z.) races, an out-
sider, Gilderoy, by Tradnoer, won the principal event,
beating the old Australian grey, Lone Hand, bv a bare
nose. There were only twelve investors on Gilderoy,
and they received a dividend of £26 5s , each for their
ten shillings.
“A regatta will he held at Launceston, Tasmania,

over to assert his claims to a second win.
Messenger writes to us, with reference to the
statement that, daring bis recent race with Beach, the
latter made use of insulting remarks towards him, that
he heard nothing of the kind, and can’t believe that
Beach did anything cf the sort, unless in chaff. He
regards Beach as one of his very best friends, and one
of the most straightforward and respectable men he
ever met.
At Wellington (N.Z.) Bacing Club Summer
Meeting, Him rva, by Tradnoer—Sweetbriar. won the
Ma ! den, New Year, and the Hurdles. In this latter
event two of the horses came to grief at the first
hurdle, and their riders were injured, while one of the
onlookers named Bailey was kicked. Me died the next
day. Although only three started in the Cup, it caused
a deal of exciu input, Mischief, who is by Albany,
Malice, beating the favourite, Louie. Time for the two
miles, 3 min. 411 sec.
By the Berengiaria, Mr. A. K. Finlay sent to
Australia three mares that should prove an acquisition
to any stnd. They consist of a chestnut mare by
Maroon from Invcrsnaid, by Leamington ; chestnut
filly, three rears old, by King Aiphonso from Jamaica;
and a bay filly by 8eo Saw, from Mrs. Waller, by King
Tom. The second-named is full sister to the American
celebrity Foxlall, and she will foal to Australian time.
Ihe Maroon mare must also be an American, and pio-
bably was purchased by Mr. Finlay while he was travel-
ling through the United States.
The 22 feet open boat race between the Rosetta
and at. (Jiispin, for £25 aside, was sated on Saturday
afternoon, over a courts from the Vernon round the
Lightship and Sow, and back. The boats were i ailed by
Newton and Fletcher respectively. The Koset'a ltd
from the start end rounded the Lightship 1 minute
ahead of “ 1 he Snob,’’ which was not well sailed by
Fletcher, who, considering his mainsail was setting
badly, tried to take too much out of her. In the run
home the two boats cracked on ail sail they could, but
the Hosetta increased her lead and finished Imin. lOaeo.
in front of her opponent.
The American sloop Vixen, which defeated the
English cuMer Maggie, has a splendid record. Launched
in May, 1*71, she has started in thirty races, been win-
ner in seventeen of them, been placed second eight
times, third four times, and in only one race of the
thirty has the failed to gain a place. She was built at
Philadelphia, from an enlarged model of tbe famous
snoop White Cap, row owned by Mr. J. M. Forbes, of
Bottom The model was by Captain Bobert Fish, and
she was built by Albertson Bros, for Mr. Ludlow
Livingston. She is 62ft lin ove< all, 44ft lin water-line,
16ft team, 5ft ckplh cf hold, and 4tt lOin draught of
water. Her mast is 61(t, topmast 25!t, boom 48£t, gaff
18it, bowsprit 17ft.
From an athletic point of view, the results of
the three Mjers-Gsorge races have been remarkable.
Myers’ time in the halt-mile beats all peiformancesever
made by any one but himkeif, and George surpassed
anything ever done by an Englishman. In the mile we
fiud the same play, with a change in the oast of
characters. Gecrge’s time is faster than all previous
performances by any me save himself, while Myers
beat any record ever made by an American. The three-
quarter mile has the same history as tbe mile, George
beating all records but his own, and Myers' lime being
fur faster than any former pertoimance by an American.
It is also worthy of note that these wonderful results
have been achieved in spite of bad weather, slow tracks,
and poor condition cf the runners.
The Intercolonial cricket match came to a ter*
mination on Saturday, in favour of the Victorians by
one innings and 166 runs. The New South Welshmen
made the worst show of cricket ever seen in a big match
on the Association Ground. Appended are the scores :
Victorian Eleven, first innings—Bonner 42, Eosser 19,
Horan 21, Midwinter 10, M’Donnell 61. Blackhan 32,
Palmer 34. M’Sbane 0, Soott 28, Boyle 21, Cooper (not
out) 0, sundries 8; total, 281. New South Wales, first
innings—Mast-ie 2. Jones 7, Murdoch 16, C. Bannerman

A different version of the trouble in the pavilion
at the close of the late cricket match England v. Aus-
tralia has been sent us, just as strongly vouched for as
was the one we published last week. The story now
runs that Bead of the English team, who is given to
small jocularities, in the hearing of some half-a-score
of gentlemen in the room sot apart for the Australian
Eleven, remarked that Spoiforth cut up the ground at
a certain match in England for the purpose of damaging
the chances of the opposing team. Spoftorth resenting
jocularities which conveyed inoculations of foul play,
hotly told Bead that he was a liar, and was about to
strike him when prevented by the Sydney umpire and
others, Spoiforth showed his cricketing boots in proof
that he didn’t wear nails enough to injure any ground,
whereupon Bead said he had merely spoken in jest, and
so the quarrel endsd.
At the Tanranga (N.Z.) races, the big event
resulted in a big surprise, Luck penny, who went to the
post with odds of 5 to 1 on him, going down before his
solitary opponent. Woodpecker, who started with the
same odds against him. On the second day of the meet-
ing there was quite a revulsion of feeling, and the
previously underrated Woodpecker was now backed in
the Publicans’ Handicap to “ link creation," including,
of course, the unlucky Luokpenny. At the appointed
time Luckpenny was at the post, ready to do or die ;
but alas I the favourite Woodpecker and his jock wero
nowhere to be teen. After waiting half an hour, Mr.
Quinlia ordered hie jockey to walk over, notwithetand-
iug that the starter refused to drop the flag. On coming
back to the paddook both jookey and owner came in for
a good deal of badinage, and there was quite a “ hulla-
baloo" for some considerable time. At last the stewards
met, and declared it no race, but Mr. Qainlan declined
to again start his horse, alleging that he was fairly
entitled to the stakes. However, Mr. Jordan, who
acted as judge, having procured a copy of the rules,
discovered that there was a fine of two guineas for a
jookey being late, but as against this there was also a
hno of five guineas for a jockey starting without the
starter's consent. This made matters somewhat worse
for Mr. Quinlan, and he elected to start his horse again,
when Woodpecker justified the confidence of his
backers by winning from start to finish."

We give this week tho portraits of Messrs.

When the Dublin Corporation refused to confer

‘Ginoral’up there instead. Where (with a wink)
he’ll be out of sight and out of mind.’’ (Cheers )
The Austrian Ambassador at Paris, whose death
by suicide was recently announced, was indentified in a
very curie us manner. He shot himself and relied on to
the pavement. He was pulled over to a heap of sand
and plaster, and tho revolver disappearing, the crowd
which gathered, got the impression that be was a
builder, and had fallen from an edefice in coarse of
erection alongside. A valet however, pointed out that
tho soles of his boots were blackened—a custom rare in
France—and that he must bo a man belonging to tho
upper classes. Bis identification followed.
During the Belt libel case, the plaintiff, in a
room attached to the court, modelled a bn&t of Signor
Pagliattl. When he entered the court carrying it he
was vociferously cheered, and despite Sir Fredeihk
Leighton’s evidence, and that of the whole et the
Academy clique, that he was incapable of artistic work,
got a thumping verdict. In tbe matter of facts (relative
to the “ ghost in bis studio,’’) Belt had the best of it,
but the sculptors, with one or two exceptions, mado a
dead set at him. During his evidence tor the defence,
the Hon. Alex. Yotke said he first heard from the
Queen that Belt did not execute his own works, but on
his stating that the plaintiff had been working in his
presence tor days on a bust of his late brother Eliot,
Her Majesty sent next day for Mr. Belt and gave him a
commission for the Alnert Memorial Window. It
transpired during the hearing that the Yakut Fair
artist " Spy” is Mr. Leslie Ward—” Ape,” it is wall-
known, being M. Percglni, The trial shows that artists
and sculptors are as full ef envy, hatred, and malice as
Baptist parsons, and as lor bard swearing—the police
can now hide theirdimini. bed heads. The “Mahoodtrs”
that were testified to were simply appalling. As a
matter of fact, it seems that Belt did as much of bis
work as he could, but he took more commissions than
he could personally execute in their entirety. Hia
talent is undoubted ; and as to manner, it is set down
of him that he has acquired considerable social polish
of late years, and for a man of obscure birth and limited
technical education quite shines in society. With the
public he is a hero.
We will sing a little song

lower down we see that ha acknowledges “4 doz. eggs,”

and into it they want iu their shirt-sleeves, took hold

“The ‘ Happy Fiddler’ said before he was converted

We ate advancing on tho devil’s territory." There are
some atrocious woodblocks in the thing, notably the
portrait of a Captain Body, who got “fourteen days "
for insisting on banging a big drum. Tae appearance
of this offloer should have got him life, at least. Both
these productions are inexpressibly blasphemous,
wretchedly ignorant, and horribly sordid. This is the
the truth unadorned. We have neither the time nor
the inclination to “invent laota" about publications
which are each an insult to common sense—such a blot
on tho literature of any country. However, one thing
is certain : Tho War Cry is worthy of the Harmy, and
the Harmy of the War Cry.
The Camden Times is, like the papers Trotty
Veok used to road, “ full of information." The last
number of that brilliant publication tells us of “ A Dress
Concert" (I) having been given, there, but wo learn
(with some surprise, as it was a “dress oonoort ’’) that:
“The aristocratic portion of the audience did not,
strictly speaking, appear in full evening dross, and
on that oeoasion,” because “the evening was very
close, and people like to be attired in garments cool."
It is evident by this that the writer is not, as wj were
disposed to think, a waiter. He has never worn evening
dress, which is the ooolest of all costumes —except,
perhaps, the serge shirt and moles with which he is
probably familiar. The performers numbered amongst
them “ Mr. Halliwell (sic), a magnificent bass singers
(sic) —one of the bast in the colonies j Dr. Ellis, treble
(sic), a beautiful singer; Miss Cowley, alto—splendid
singer; Mr. Htlnerbein (sic), a brialliant (sic) pianist;
and Mias Dongar sang ‘The Sjranado’ (sic) from Eigo-
lette; ‘Halliwell’ ‘I’m a Eoamer,’ Menlolsshon (sic).
Dr. Beattie then read in an excellent style a comic
family dialogue." The writer describes the plot of this
reading, but has no more idea than the man in the
moon when ha states that the lady “ when visiting a
mercer’s shop for some silk, she discovered, to her
horror, that the young man wis merely a draper's
assistant,” that the tale was Charles Dickens'
sketch, *• Horatio Hparkins.” Someone then gave the
Nightingale by “ Gauz ’’ (sic), and finally the National
Anthem was “sang” (sic) and the concert terminated.
Now a perusal of this notice affords us food for thought.
What is the man who wrote it ? Is he the sexton, the
bailiff, the pub boots, or the road-mender ? I a he a Bum
special who has been asked to oblige the local paper, or
in hia intervals of musical criticism does he hawk round
cabbages, or perform on the muflia.bell? Wo should

Sohoola with material for more than a quarlec of a.
century, and ha spread his name yet further afield in

opposition, aud consequently had a very wide

A band of grave-robbers
were caught in Philadelphia
lately, while carrying tfl six
corpses from the cemetery.
They were caught by some

the newspaper reporters would

cunning. You don't catch
them in a hurry—unless you

A Melbourne Herald
reporter gives a cask of beer a
par. It was sent (we don’t
mean the reporter but the
cask) to the sports, and was,
we learn, •• Fully up to the
standard maintained by the
brewery." The only way, that
reminds na. to assure the pre-
sence of a Melbourne Herald
or Bum reporter anywhere, is
to know that a cask of beer
has been sent to the place.
Then the editor may be sure ha
will get a notice —of the cask,
anyway.
A gallant lieutenant took hia charger into
Watson's Bay to bathe him, the other day. , . . The
valliant officer now says he is willing to be led against
any enemy that won’t go taking people by surprise or
firing at anyone but the privates, but he won’t take a
horse into the water, not for the Victoria Cross. He
now passes his evenings cheerfully endeavouring to
draw his sword, while all available bombardiers are busy
night and day trying to brighten his buttons and polish
the peak of his cap.
After all, it looks as if Warrnamoool is to be

Do you know what a member of the Govern-
ment did ? He travelled oa board the City of Brisbane,
Captain ekinner, to Newcastle, and there being a great
rush of passengers, tho captain gave up to the hon.
member hie own cabin. Yet the first thing the Minister
die, on arrival, was to direct the police to count the
passengers, and bad tbe captain fined £20. Captain
Skinner now says that when next that gentleman goes
up by hia boat be will feel very much inclined to present
him with a testimonial. Something, we presume, in the
leather line.
A Queensland paper contained the following
sentence, some time back : « There is abundance of rum
for two Properly-conducted journals in the Toowoomba

This comes from the Manning Eiver Times
so wo give it for what it is worth. That is to say, wo

. The Melpomene dropped over four hundred
immigrants in Rockhampton recently. On the first
night in the dep6t the single girls raised the alarm that
a man was striving to break into their quarters. The
police having searched diligently, could find no trace
which would lead them to suppose that any such

was that, “The wish is father—" No. But that.

valuable, because it will bo remembered that he enter-
tained such a favourable opinion '■ f the splendid

Judge Docker’s opinion of the Navigation Act
of 18il is that it is “ nob very skilfully drawn up " The
same remark would nptly apply to quite n. heap of other
Acta as well. On Thursday last the agent of the ship
Nemesis was pr >soouted for allowing the vBssel to start
on a voyage with a “list to port," which placed the
Plimsoll mark on that side under water According to
this inspired Act, however, nothing oan bo done unless
this mark is submerged on both sides. But tbe Nemesis
bad the line drawn on one side only Therefore the cose
was dismissed. This is a happy and extremely desirable
style of arranging matters indeed. It saves paint and
prosecution, and strongly reminds us of the Bailor who
married three wives instead of two, j ust to escape being
tried for bigamy.
The Qunnedah Advertiser is a paper, the
eccentricity of which borders upon the maniacal. It
publishes a par. in one issue which it admits ” is dis-
graceful, and the story absolutely untrue;" and then,
further referring to the item, it says: “ It was handed
to os for publication by Mr. W. L. Douglas, and with
him lies the responsibility of such a discreditable para-
graph ” Now it seems this 11 discreditable paragraph)”
whs about no less a person than a local clergyman, and
while accepting theite n, the editir stems to forget
that ho alone is responsible for its appearsnoo If the
thi"g wn,<i "disgraceful,” etc , why did the (t unnedah
advertiser print it ? This is the kind of journalism
that is oniy known in planes like Gunnefah, and it is a
matter for congratulation that hardly anybody knows

A Queensland squatter has, we consider after
some c msideration, earned the title of the very. Very
Meanest Man. Ha engaged a blackboy (a smart stock-
man; and bis gin at £5 a year—the latter to cook end
wash. They worked for ten months, when, seeing that
he would have to ante up, he discharged both, sa-mg
they had "taken out their screw in luxuries.” Two
months later, being short-handed at mustering, he got
a warrant for the boy, saying that he bad advanced him
over £21; whereupon the lad was brought back, in
handcuffs, over fifty miles. A lot of people were talk-
ing about this affair in Queensland, and at first some
surprise was expressed at the squatter’s conduct.
When, however, it. transpired that he had been brought
up for the Church, all astonishment at the grazier’s
stingy proclivities vanished.
“ Esperauza, an Australian tale,” by E W
O’Sullivan. Hammond and Co , Sydney Hbperanza i*

monplaoo. One specimen ie enough : when the heroine
io on a steamer coming from Watson’s Bay to Sydney,
we are told—“ The waves now swept clean over the bul-
warks, threatening to carry oil all on board who were
not 'lashed to the vessel 1' , , • Men turned pale
every time the vessel careened!”’ The conception of
the sixpenny passengers from Watson’s Bay being
'*lashed to the vessel” daring the voyage, id the only
original idea in the book. In sentiment, the author is
du'l; in his attempts at sensationalism, he is ridiculous.
Tlio book is useless.
Alfred, the aesthetic, is pleased to find that the
remarks in the H/Vkning ISnwa, relative to tbe dis-
graceful state of the pens Bud cages which contain our
“ national zoological and ornithological collection,
have led to immediate steps being taken to improve
matters, and have given groat pleasure to all.” But
Alf. musa’t take all the credit. The prime movers in
the affair were tbe “ zoological collection" of rats that
trooped into our *' national" nuisance pens a few nights
ago and gobbled up all they could twist their jaws
round. t’ho greatest affliction to Alfred, however, is
tbe fact that tbe ■* beautiml canaries do not sing ” In
other words, they don’t earn their sop. And the fact is
the whole crowd of our national canaries were only fit
for cat’s meat. If we are to have a “ zoological and
ornithological collection” let good judges be asked to
select the specimens, and see we are not compelled to
pay £10 for an object barely worth lOd. Wo know
whore they oan obtain a jackass.
The proprietary of Sydney Punch announce
that "it is their present intention to retain to en-
graved blocks for their cartoons and other pictures in
place of the lithographic process, and otherwise to
improve the journal." So far as the blocks are con-
cerned, they have kept their word. They have ** re-
turned to engraved blocks "—to the engraved blocks
which have been portion of their assets daring the last
twenty years, and which have passed with the rest of
the lumber from one proprietary to another. The only
alteration is that in place of the always oapable and
frequently witty letter-press which, in days of yore,
fora ed the mottos for these half and quarter-page illus-
trations, or was appended to the initial letters, etc ,
they have now subjoined to them puerile silly inani-
ties, calculated to inspire melancholia and predispose
to crime. What have the public done that they should
be pelted with the resurrected dead bodies of long-
interred facetiae, now dragged from their resting
places on editorial shoulders ? " Alas, poor Punch I

There was a Chinese
funeral out at Huslem’s Creek
the other day. A suspicions-
looking person—supposed by
the supoi stitious Chows who
accompanied the corpse to its
last resiirg-plaoi, to be tbe
spirit of a murderer —was seen
prowling around among the
graves. Whan one if the
mourners came round haif an
hour afterwards to drop a final
tear and see that the corpse
was snog, he distovered that
the baked meats, which had
been placed on the tomb in
accordance with an immemo-
rial Chinese custom, were
gone. About three graves off
he found a Shrood man lying
prone on his face. We do not

Time tries all things, and eventually causes
them to find their proper level. And when they do find
it they've got to squat right down and stay there. For
instance, a popular jeurnal draws public attention to a
piece of official bungling. The superintendent gets his
back up at once, and angrily asks the assistant, “ what's
the meaning of all this humbug The Assistants
mmediately tells the Manager, “ why don't you look
after the things yourself,'' the Manager tells the
operator he'll “raise Cain’’ unless they look a little
smarter, the operator hits a counter clerk under the
ear, and clears—this clerk hoists a messenger out on the
toe of his boot like a rocket, and this boy in his turn
reads the Riot Act out to the grooms. Presently the
war by washy" troop along to swab the floors, and
the grooms lose half a day consigning these sylih-liko
scrubbers to various places in the dim and uncertain
future. So the guilty parties are punished at last,
justice is appeased, and all goes well till the next
time.

An English lady recently suggested that “if
soldiers are decorated for killing the enemies of the

Medals are given now-a-days for the slaughter, in so-
called wars, of men whose hands are tied. But these
dead men’s hands will drag to their own dishonoured
graves all this pomp and pride and power one day.

A man was found dead in the bush near the

It is stated that when the current mail con-
tracts from Sydney to Frisco terminate, which will bo
very shortly, there will be competition for the subsidy.
The White Star lino which lately has commenced to
ran steamers between Frisco and Honolulu intend to
bid for the service, and the Orient Company are re-
ported to have the service also in view. The Pacifla
Mail Company, which has the contract at present, and
has borne the brunt of the pioneering, and done the
service thoroughly well, should certainly have the pre-
ference, if their tender be anything like equal to the
others; that is to say provided the contract is to be
renewed at all. We suspect that the Orient Company
means merely to try for the subsidy, not for a line of
steamers to Frisco, but by their present line and route
via Suez outward, and the Cape homeward.
A few months ago a raid was made on a dancing

he earned his living A detective had seen him
repeatedly parading the streets at night " with his face
painted and powdered," and the inference the police
drew from this was somewhat 'startling. The accused,
being under remand, may of course disprove these state-
ments. But the authorities should keep on the alert
for all that. If not, the days of Nero will soon return,
and we must once more return to the punishment of

The unparalleled feat of modern navigation was
made by one Barnard viilfoy, an American, who is now
laid np with t.vphoid fever at Maryborough. He set
©ut from San Francisco by himself in a little boat on

most surprising art ventures, some of which—onlv that
thov are writ,tpu down in his lot-book —wo should feel
inclined to doWJt But his bdht is W be seen hanging
from the davits of the schooner which picked him up off
the Queensland coast. This is conclusive evidence. It
seams that he ran ehort of provisions after He was at
sea a while and had to live on barnacles—like a city
poet. But being an ingenious man, he soon hit upon
a plan to get provisions whenever he wanted them. He
had a floating anchor in the boat which he threw oat
and sat astride in the water. Then he overturned the
vessel, and when aha got full of water righted her again
md commenced to bail out. The bottom was always
’nil of fish. Of course. But from spending so much
bine in tbe water his body began to get covered with
scales. He has them now. We suppose he will be tes-
timonialiaed.
The acquittal of Priestley and Mrs. Hamilton,
of the murder at Auckland, N.Z , of Hugh Hamilton,
husband of the female prisoner, was not unexpected.
T’?e evidence from a moral point of view was irresist-
ibly strong. Legally, it was weak ; still weaker was the
manner in which the facts were marshalled by the
counsel for the Crown. The prisoners were defended
by Mr. Frederick Earl, a rising young barrister who has
, j ust entered the dress-circle, so to speak, of the forensic
amphitheatre, and who must be held to have been verv
fortunate in securing so sensational a oass for his dehM.
Mr Earl looked very pretty indeed. He was neatly
attired in a pale blue silk handkerchief and an eye glass,
which he used with great effect during his speech. As
onr readers should already be familiar with the details
of the evidence, it will now be only necessary to state
that Hamilton’s murder—for he undoubtedly was mur-
dered, and by one or both of the persons accused—was
brought about by "Priestly interference” with hia
wife, a hatchet-faced hag of two or three and thirty,
for failing in love with whom the male prisoner should
have been hanged. Not only on this score did he de-
serve tbe gallows. He wrote for the woman a villainous
" poetic " acrostic, in Sunday-school book metre, which
should have been sufficient to rivet the broken link in
the ot ain of circumstantial evidence against him. He
is an attenuated, rat.like, connterj umperish creature of
the typical holy fraud order. When a holy fraud is
thin, he rarely shaves. Priestley didn’t shave The
fat fraud always shaves—generally tho upper lip. It
makes him look meek. He never shaves bis lower lip
That would make him appsar sensual. Priestley and
his partner in crime were as thin as a pair of shadows
turned sideways Ills clumsily attempted and alto-
getber unnecessary alibi was thin, too. And it seemed,
at times, that the white tic with which the pious
divinity student had intended to adorn his sacerdotal
windpipe might, ere a month or two, be supplanted by
the hangman’s knot. However, he got off. Nothing
succeeds like success
The trial, at Auckland, N.Z., of W. W. Gudgeon,
charged with having attempted to commit rape on Mrs.
Lizzie Davies Ehrenfried, was one of tbe most sansa-
tion«l ra o e« yet heard in any Australasian court of law
Mr. Wilfrid Waite Gudgeon is an elegant young bank
clerk, who haa a wife and email young family of his
own. His dear friend tho dashing Mrs. Ehrenfried is
tbe daughter of an Oriental tailor at Auckland. She
has seen perhaps nearly thirty summers, and is,
unlike most of her Jewish sisters of that age, of by no
means matronly appearance. F >r reasons. Mr. Ebren-
fried, to whom his loving wife affectionately alluded in
her letters as •* dear old Louis," appeared, on the morn-
ing the case opened, very confident as to its result. He
is a member of an opulent Arm of brewers, and is a fat
Hebrew gentleman who, for some reason best known to
himself, wears his nose on one side of hie face, and on
all occasions exhibits a large amount of self-possession
and watch-chain. “Dear old Louis" is half-a century
old, has been married eleven y ears, is still hoirless, and
has had his nose still more out of joint since the trial
Mrs. E. is about to present him with an heir. She
lived at the Thames, near Auckland, and “ led society"
there. She succeeded in setting the Thames on fire.
Anyhow, she set Mr. dudgeon on fire. Mr. and Mrs.
G. constantly visited Mr. and Mrs. E. Then things
narrowed down a little—after nearly a couple of years
A slight coolness eventuated. But the coolness wasn’t
between Mr. Q. and the lady, who “ preferred a Gud-
geon to an Ehren-tried." It seems to have been with
them, a case of " meet me under the verandah," and
" I’ll have the honso in darkness" and so on. “ Old
Louis" pretended that he was going to Auckland one
evening. He started by the steamer, went a lew miles,
got a boat to land him and returned —as he said, to see
how things were going at the brewery. He found,
if not what he expected, at least what he might
reasonably have i-xpected. Mischief was beewing.
Louisa beard him coming. She screamed. Dear
old Louis and the witness he had brought with
him booted Mr. G out of the house, and Mrs. E.
told her husband that the case was one of assault.
Louis professed to believe her, and prosecuted Gudgeon.
Mrs. Ehrenfried proved herself in the box to be a most
artistic liar. She " swore straight." Sh« was what
lawyers call " a good witness.” It would have been all
the same had dudgeon's neck been in the nooso While
human beings can so coolly call the Almighty as a
witness to the truth of such statements, terrible is the
task of the jury who are sent into the box to decide
between the honour of a woman and the liberty of a
man. The judge, a person named dillios, who was ele-
vated to the flench for motives of political expediency
by Sir Julius Vogel, acted ns we have seen another
political judge (not in New Zealand) act, when he was
arbiter between a pretty woman who had to maintain
her honour at, all hazards, and someone else. But in
vain. Mrs. Ehrenfried’s evidence utterly broke down.
She had written letters to a cousin of hers, imploring
the latter to divulge nothing. After she had emphati-
cally denied everything, she was confronted with her
letters. No, she didn't think they were in her hand-
writing. Then she didn’t remember having written
them. She was sura she couldn’t have done so.
Further on fhe proceeded to explain what she meant
when she wrote such and such a passage. There wore
glaring discrepancies in the >usband’s evidence. Gud.
geon was well defended bv Mr. Heskoth. The judge
summed up dead against the accused, in the face of the
most overwhelming evidence as to his innocence of the
particular crime with which he was charged Ho also
denounced Mr Hesketh for having pleaded on behalf of
the prisoner that the criminal intimacy was an old
one. Such a plea, he said, was unmanly and dishonour-
able. But the jury found Gudgeon not guilty, and
cow Judge Gillies is up to his neck ia trouble with the
Law dociety.
Anthony Trollope died at the ‘ Fixed Period’—
the aee at which, in his book of that name, it is decided,
after much discussion, that people are better out of the
world.
Hon. Ivo Bligh is a brother of that eccentric
anti-vaccinating young nobleman Lord Clifton, and,
therefore, a younger eon of the Earl of Darnley. Mr.
Bligh haa had bellows to mend lately, but though be
has been unable to play at all this season at home, it is
hoped a winter in Australia may serve to set him right
again.
Mr. Henry Yyner, P.M., of Tumut, is a first
cousin of the inbeiitcr of the Yyner Es’atcs The latter
is a brother of the Marchioness of Eipon, and related
to half the peerage of Great Britain. A son of Mr.
Vynor, of Tumut, is in mo Temora branch of the Bank
of New South Wales. We glean all this from the
Temora Herald
When Arabi Pasha, the Egyptian patriot, left
the court after his sentence, Mrs. Mark Napier gave
him her bouquet. This innocent act excited awful
wrath in Cairo, and as soon as it was known, a meeting
was called to expel Mr Mark Napier from the Khedivial
Club. The arguments for and against such a course
were presented at great length and with great energy;
but just as the club was about to come to a conclusion,
it was suddenly discovered that Mr. Napier was not a
member of it.
Little Bailey, of Temora, is a hitter man with
people he doesn’t like. This is tho way he speaks in
bis paper of a brother journalist:—"The Blankton
Miner is started by a notorious individual, known as
one-armed Hudson. This person is a blot on Queens,
land journalism, and a stain on the escutcheon of the
fourth estate of that brilliant colony, which ought to
bo removed," Perhaps Bailey would not be so bitter,
but that Hudson has only one arm.
When old Archibald Johnson, of Tahara (and a
variety of other Victorian stations) died he left about
£350 000 and a widow, fat, fair, and forty-two or three,
who immediately conferred herself matrimonially on an
elegant twenty-five year eld bank clerk, one Nicholas.
Nicholas’ good luck has played the very devil with the
prospect of old Johnson’s children, who are all pretty
well out of their father’s will. The estate is now going
into what is facetiously termed " equity."
Mr. Henry Edelman, who on Monday night, at
the Masonic Hall, rose to oppose the motion recognis-
ing and placing on record “ the eminent services to re-
ligion and to the great cause of Christian education
rendered by Archbishop Vaughan since his arrival in the
colony," and was “ beot-hustled" out, is a somewhat
eccentric schoolmaster, formerly in the employ of tho
Victorian Department of Education, and he has pub-
lished a queer book entitled “ The Royal Road to
Grammar and Analysis.”
Labouchero, editor of Truth, is a very short,
and very ordinary looking man, whom a stranger would
at first sight,, set down as a bacon merchant sooner than
he would take him for a brilliant journalist. The only
striking features about him are his eyes. And it is not
their beauty, but their balf-sleepy weaselish look which
is striking He is as great a success as a journalist, as
he was a failure as a theatrical manager. He took the
Queen’s Theatre in Longacre once, and played with
Henrietta Hod son—whom he subsequently married—as
a "star" in dramas which the public damned. But
now he "holds it," and cares as little for the play,
going public as they care for him.
The Hon. John Forrest, C.M.G., and Surveyor-
General of South Australia, who made his mark first as
an explorer, is a splendid type of a muscular Christian.
Tall, broad,shouldered, and deep-chested, with a mas-
sive and expressive bronzed countenance, he impresses
one as being just the sort of man who would in any
undertaking ‘‘door die." His frank and unassuming
manners have rendered him very popular, and no native
of the colony is more esteemed than John Forrest. He
has just had tho honour of being elected a member of
the Executive Council of tho colony for which he has
laboured so diligently. Mr. Surveyor Alexander For-
rest (his brother), who has also done good service in
opening up the vast Western wilds, is of much slighter
physique, but has exhibited on trying occasions all the
endurance of a born explorer.
By the way, William L. Winans, the rich
American, has recently lost, in London, a law suit over
a deer forest William was about ten y ears ago the talk
of London. He had at that time the oigar ship lying in
the East Indian docks, and that remarkable specimen
of naval architecture was the wonder of all who saw it,
Tho fittings of the saloon and state rooms—carved
many of them —were of the most gorgeous description,
and the engines marvels of bright and intricate steel
tracery. But Mr. Winans became famous in another
way. He fell in love with an elegant girl at Trnefltt’s,
the Bond street barbers, and, as she alleged, promised to
marry her. Subsequently he declined, and she brought
an action in the Court of Queen’s Bench for breach and
other things which need not be animadverted upon.
During the trial it transpired that the girl had made
every attempt to improve Mr. Winans’ education, bub
without success. Like Mr. Gebhardt, he could not
write three words correctly—the letters produced by the
pleintitf eliciting screams of laughter. The trial was
stopped after two days, and the lady got £1500 and
costs. One of his notea was as follows :—“ der Kait
ten my dres close to the oittyat 5 sharrup, goin to dine
withunkel will.”
The Echo : —“ Mr. T. King, Mayor of Glenelg,
and Mr. H. Dawson, washed overboard a yacht ana
drowned in St. Vincent’s Gulf " This is wrong of course.
It was Mr. King’s father, a butchtr, who was drowned.
He was a very goodnatured man, but he used to be a
kind of "awful dad" to Tom. “Tore,” as is well-
known, is the principal proprietor of the S. A. Adver-
tiser and the Chronicle and Mail. He is likewise a
member of Parliament, and was, under the Morgan
Administration, Minister for Education. Thisappoint-
ment, which was obviously made to secure tbe support
of the ’1 iser (as they call it), caused much jocularity
at the time ; but the affairs of the Department were
capitally administered bv Mr. J. L Bonython, Mr.
King’s sub-editor, who likewise accompanied Thomas
on bis Ministerial tours, aud managed affairs with such
adroitness, that when tbe Minister saw his scholastic
speeches reported in his own paper, no one was more
thoroughly staggered than himself a*, the intelligence
and acumen displayed therein. Mr. King is Mayor of
Olenelg for the present year, and has a large house
there with a towir on top of it —a fashion much in
vogue amongst Glenelg grandees; who probably con-
sider that if circumstances prevent them from doing tbe
" grand tower” in one sense they can always success-
fully accomplish it in another.
Here is a verse from a poem by Clement Scott,
which was recited at the Adelphi Theatre, London, on
the night before the grand review of the Egyptian troops
in St. James’ Park :—
“ We are sick to death of the scorching sun, and the
desert stretching for miles away ;
We are all of ns longing fo get at the foe, and sweep
the sand with our swords t«-day.
Our horses look with piteous eyes—they havo little
to eat and nothing to do;
And the land around is horribly white, and the sky
above is terribiy blue
Bat its over now, so the Colonel says he is ready to
start, we are ready to go.
And the cavalry boys will be led by men—E wart, arc!
Russell, and Drury-Lowe.
Just once again let me stroke the mane, let me kiss
the neck, and feel tbe breath
Of the go«d little horse who will carry mo on to the
end of the battle—to life or death.
• Give us a grip of your fist, old man.’ Let ns all keep
close whan tbe charge begins ;
Qcd is watching o’er those at home, God forgive ns
far all our sins I
So pass the word in the dark, and then.
When the bugle rounds let us mount like men I"
It is a pity that such verso was not written for a
worthier oauee. But if the cause had been worthier
perhaps Clement wouldn’t have been "in it." It takes
such men as his namesake Lewis to handle epic themes.
LICKED AGAIN!

DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
The defeat of Bishop Moran in the contest for a
aaat in the New Zealand Assembly is considered a most
am phatie declaration in favour of secular education.
XUe Bishop took his gruel very unkindly.
Seven ministers applied at the Wesleyan Con-
ference for leave of absence to visit England—id health
and a purse of sovereigns. We know. Just now there
are about a dozen K C. priests and bishops on tha
homeward track. Couldn’t they all go ?
Father Slattery, of Temora, was lately presented
by his congregation with a purse of 175 sovoroigus prior
to his depaitnre for the old country. We are sorry that
we cannot spare the time now to run home and asa the
old boy to throw a loose ieg around Bans.
There has been a proposition before the Auck-
land holy people for tne establishment of a billiard-room
in connection with one of the churches and to te under
the control of the deacons. The church, alone, prasnm-
abiy, was unaide to compete with the “puos." The
proposal, strangely enough, was not adopted.
It is said that Bishop Thornton’s appeal in
England tor pecuniaiy help in aid of his Bauoiat con-
gregation was the thing that putthe set on the Victorian
loan. English capitalists were not going to trust their
good money in the handset paupers. When the next
bishop goes home, his congregation should make him a
parting presentation. They should give him a gag.
It is a peculiar thing but true that if you hold
np a threepenny hit before tne eyes of the holiest man
it will blot out, as far as ho is concerned, the size of
heaven. This is what the devil does. He selects some
particularly shining light. Keeps a coin always before
his eyes, and so geutly draws him backward into hell ey
tne ear. This is an old trick. But never terns.
At the Wesleyan Conference, held in Melbourne
the other day, one reverend gentleman observed that
«< ue could trust Bishop Moorhouse no more than he
could trust the Archbishop of the Eoman Catholics,
and he would as soon trust tne devil as trust the latter."
This is very rough—on the devil. But he trusts the
whole crowd of them to come home in due time.
The Jamberoo Catholics will pay 2a. a head per
child rather than see ineir school Closed. This zeal
will oozs out at the finger ends, especially when much
better instruction is toand to be given in the Public
Hohools free. We’ve seen a lot of the Jamoetooitus
from time to time, and if the fathers and mothers will
only tread the path to paradise correctly themselves
the children will easily follow their tracks. They oar t
miss ’em.
We see by our English files that a pious Ameri-
can has propnesiod a now deluge for 1885 This gent e-
uidUKWho can hardly be called disinterested, is building
aa ant 200 feet long, in reaJine.-s for the second flood,
when it occurs, and, with a decided eye to protit he
oilers to take passengers at BI000, but he does not
mention their ultimate destination I Perhaps he ex-
peots Frank Warden aboard, in which case ihe omis-
sion [Stop right hero, —Ed ]
It is calculated that in three months hence, there
will be more colonial prelates on the “continoug " than
in all Australia. Satan says he objects to this. It’s
not flghtiug fair. Ministers distract their flocks’ atten-
tion by party polities, and thou Nicholas t>eu., swoops
down, yanks otf a tcore, shouts •*Bully for mei"
and goes for more. Tne clergy are as necessary
for him as the doctors are for undertax erf.
A minister explained at the lata Wesleyan Con-
ference that when he tried good hanuy (Sacramental
wine, all the conscientious members of his congregation
rolled up to the rails; bat when he oaanged this tor
non-intoxicating colonial wine, none of them ever came
to the front. We never knew before that there were so
many conscientious people in the world. We never had
this stanuardof computation to reckon by.
“General” Booth’s latest sensational convert
is a gaol-bird of seventeen and a naif years’ standing.
Ho described his feeling* when he heard the words of
grace in this fashion : “ I felt as if an electric battery
was going through me, and my sins going out through
the pores of my flash." Subsequently, the (Jentr.il
‘■went through him," and reaped a fair harvest of
stolen jewellery for the Lord. After this the new con-
vert went out and got drunk with holy joy and gin.
Judas Iscariot was the first “ worker in the
Looard's vineyard" who received a purse of sovereigns
and a testimonial. His friends and admirers,—the
Ministry, magistrates, and most influential citizens of
the time, presented him with thirty pieces of silver
and a handsome halter. Shortly after, Judas saw
through the hollow mockery of the entertainment, so he
threw the purse away and hanged himself in a held.
Men and maimers have very much haltered however
since the days of Judas.
Archbishop Vaughan was down on the Mnrrum-
bidgee the other flay. He tooa his gun with him. Aad
shot a magpie. Which was asleep at the time. We
forget what sort of gun Peter used to carry with him
when he went out shooting. Our Biblical knowledge is
so vague. And this also concerns shooting. When the
Archbishop of Canterbury was buried, the Koyal
Family was present—by proxy. The Prince of Wales-
who was shooting at Orwell Park—sent the Marquis of
Hamilton to represent him, and the Hook —also shoot,
ing. we suppose—was represented by some other star-
anu-gartered individual. Wales will be the Defender
of the Faith one day. The Faith has our siucerest
sympathy.
He was a Baptist parson. He rose in the pulpit
to give out the hymn -‘This world is all a fueling
show," and after clearing his throat, he struck a high
pitch of voice and began solemnly, “This world is ad a
floating shoe." Everybody smiled except the deacon-,
and the minister was ofeveied with confusion ai he began
again, “ This world is all a shouting flow." This only
made matters worse, and the unhappy man cleared his
throat with tremendous force ana began once again,
•• Tills world is all a floating she.” Tnon he slammed
down the hymn-book, and, wiping his clammy brow,
said “Brethren, lor some reason I cannot read that
hymn as it should be read. We will omit it, and the
choir will please sing the grand eld hymn beginning ‘Just
as I am, without one flea.’
They tell this tale in Victoria. A Presbyterian
clergyman in New (south Walei announced his resigns-
tiou-positively his last appearance. The pulpit is
evidently copying the stage in some things. Before
retiring this " worker" donated JE25 to the chutoh
building fund under certain legal conditions These not
being fulfilled he requested the wardens to ‘ give back. '
Then the elders held a pow-wow and passed this lot
“ That the money be not returned at present, but held
in abeyance for six months, and if at the expiration of
that time the Presbyterian Church affairs be not m a
prosperous condition, the subject may be againi opened
lor discussion." Shortly after the chairman dedared
that the committee did not recognise the responsibility
of the Kev. Mr. Gotall’s claim. Then the choir sang
“ an ’im," and the clergyman consigned the lot to
divers unexplored portions in the laud of the Great
Unknowable.
Dr. Huntley, a late Aichbishopof Canterbury,
did uot die of starvation after all. In the autobiography
of Alison, the historian, we read: “This successor of
the barefooted apostles kept open-house once a week,
subject to only one condition. ‘ The dinner was served
with tbe utmost splendour; thirty livery servants and
fifteen out of livery attended on the guests; a profusion
of magnificent plate loaded the table, and the viands,
cooked with French delicacy, vied with the wines in
evincing the hospitality of the noble host' * The only
security taken against the hospitality of the Primate
being abused ’ was based on truly apestolio principles,
it was, * That none should appear but in Court dress.’ ’
John the Baptist lived on locusts, “on the half shell,"
and garden honey, but John the Presbyterian must have
his ros dindon washed down with Chateau Margaux ; and
Jtames in plush indignantly repulses Simon Bar-Jona
from the door of the festive hall bucauso he comes with
only a cotton table-oloth thrown over his shoulders
instead of oyster-bag breeches and a claw hammer,
cream-laid coat and a gorgeously frizz led-out shirt,
decorated with blazing diamonds. As Victor Hugo
says* •* Pshaw! Bool Bah I Poof I"
A touching- illustration of the queer manner in
which piety and pruriency are often mixed up with
other attributes in the emotional religionist, was
afforded the other day during the trial at Auckland of
Mrs. Hamilton, who, there is no moral doubt, sent her
husband to Paradise with a meat-axe. Anyhow, what-
ever misgivings we may have about the Paradisaical
part of the question, there isn’t the slightest about the
tomahawking. A female acquaintance of the fish-faced
murderess deposed that she and Mr. Hamilton recently
“ communicated" together, ana that she took that
occasion of remonstrating with Mrs. H. on her in-
timacy with Priestley, the njpaoritioal divinity stadent
who is suspect id, on evidence which woald hang him
over and over at the hands o( Judge Lynch, of having
had a hand in the slaughter. By the way, Priestley is
now looking about him tor a congenial soul wherein he
may take root and sow “the Word” He’ll no doubt
arrive in Sydney by an early steamer, and take advant-
age of Prank Warden’s temporary seclusion in Darling-
hurst to jump the soapy prophet’s claim.
Milner Stephen has been catching it from the
Chnreu of England pulpit in Wellington. The Eev.
Mr Coffey-— hot ooffey—preached at him, using the 9th
verse of the 8th chapter of Acts as his bludgeon. From
private information in his own possession, Mr. Coffey
was enabled to state that the prophets and apostles
never accepted money. Milner Stephen does. But
then Milner has not started a rav«n to keep him sup-
plied with iamb outlets. Mr. Caff iy referred in strong
terms of condemnation to the position taken up by Mr.
Milner Stephen with regard to his alleged powers ct
healing, and aiguad that while the gentleman mentioned
persisted in sa> mg that the posses don of his gift came
direct from God for the good of mankind, or for any
special godly service, he pat himself in the position oc
the prophets and apostles, whose gift of power to work
miracles was credited, proving them to ba messengers
of God, for the exercise of which they dared not, and
did not, receive mon«y; and Mr. Milner Stephen dare
not take money for the exercise of this gift (if it be a
gift) without putting himself in the position of Simon,
and aid who countenanced him by tneir presence were
equally guiity. The Kev. Mr. Coffey mentioned that a
number of persons had asked him to certify that they
were not in a position to pay the fee demanded by Mr.
Stephen, viz , two guineas, and said he thought such a
charge would amount m a year to at least £ 10,000. Two
of a trade can uever agree. By the way, we presume,
Coffey doesn't take money. No stipend tor instance,
as “oonsideratlou’’ for the Sacraments.
The Christchurch Presbytery has unanimously
deposed the Kev. C. Frazer, against whom the charges
included misappropriation of trust moneys and " undue
familiarity with female servants.’’ The moderator
ingenuously remarked that " the case had been a sore
calamity to the Presbyterian Church, and that nothing
but a regard for the honour of the Church and the
interest of the can.e of Christ would have compelled
them to goon with it it they had be«n able honourably
and consistently to maintain Mr. Frazer’s inuoounoo
It would have saved their interests as a bedy, and would
have been gratifying to themselves personally, to have
proclaimed his inuoceuoe to the world. Nothing bub
dire necessity had led them to bring the prosecu-
tion to the present painful issue.’’ This is very
candid, and quite expla.ns how it happens that
three times as muim evidence is needed to con-
vince parsons and professional pietists that one
of tfceir fellows has suavellod trust-money, or has
been “ unduly familiar with female servants’’ and
misiuscs as would be suffic.ent to convict any other man
of murder. it was this determination to maintain the
accused's innocence to the last possible point which
saved Beecher and a lot more. We remember now, no
further off than Sydney, a reverend tather-in God
very definitely accniel of misappropriation of trust
moneys had his innocence effectually maintained, in the
tieth of a universal aUvocce conviction outside the
circle which fouad that a declaration of innocence
served their interact i as a body.
When the B.C. Bishop Moran stood as a candi-
date tor the N.Z. House of Representatives tne other
day, of course he was all oil and honey. A more
1 biral-minded gint eman couldn't be built out of clay.
He wam't epp >sed to the Education act, be jibers,
nut be I "Is it,’’ he cried, *■ my intention remove for
the repeal of the present law ? 1 say no. My object is
to amend it, not to abolish it. If you wish to have tbe
present system, or any other, I shall nrot oppose ; I will
give to every man the liberty I claim for myself. (Ap-
plause) ” This, avcoorse, confounds the knaves who
have pretended that a Roman Catholic Bishop is eager
te discountenance heresy, and under a solemn obliga-
tion to deny to any man the right to think for himself
on religious subjects. Bat this question and answer at
tbe Bishop’s meeting clinches the contrary proof.
“ Mr. Worthington : • I belong to a sett called
the ‘ Bushmugariaus.’ I want to ask Dr.
Moran whether ho will present a petition ask-
ing the Government to give aid to our schools.’
Dr. Moran : ‘ I will.’- (Applause and laughter) ’*
Look at that now, aviokl But after all the Bishop
caved in. They askod him a harder one. He was pre-
pared to aid the inculcation of Bushmugariamsm
(whateverlh.it may be), bub teaoh the young to be
rational I Ooh, bogorra I This is what sewed him up :
—Mr. M‘ Biiue : Is the candidate in favour of granting
State aid to the teaching of Freethonght at the
Lyceum ? Dr. Moran : I do not know whether the
gentleman means to insult me or not, but I will answer
his question. I say I am not. It has come to this
The festive Bushmugarian may bring up his offspring
to observe the principles and practices of hia revered
and lofty (we suppose) religion, and the genial priest
will smile; but teaoh children to think for thum-
sei ves I Flames and faggoti s, let’s have an Inquisition !
Dr. Moran Is willing to grant liberty of oom-cienoe to
men of all creeds except Freethinkers. The Eav. Mr.
Jabbergowl of B itbseda Methodist Chapel, is likewise
willing to grant liberty of conscience to men of ail creeds
except—Papists. Arcades ambo The man who pro-
fesses to be favourable to liberty of conscience with any
exception is a fraud and an impostor, and hasn’t a gleam
of the true spirit of toleration.

Mixed Marriages of Protestants and Catholios
are greatly on tbe increase at the N Z. registry offices
An Auckland citizen has contributed £200 towards
the introduction of a wing of the Eaglish Salvation
Army The Eev. J. Miller Ross thinks that no
clergyman can live on £300 a year in this country,
‘•testimonials'’ not included. Jesus of Nazareth
never had £300 a year. £300 a year is the price of a
Victorian member of Parliament.
WOMAN ITEMS.
The Rev. Mr. Carpenter, of London, has the
biggest average of marriages. He is a great joiner I
In Rockhampton (Q ), lately, a woman buried
her husband on one Sunday, and got marntd again on
the next. The second husband now wishes he could
change places with the first.
An old scientific fossil says that two blondes or
two brunettes of opposite sexes should never kits, be-
cause their electric poles are the same. He sjezus to

meeting, people are in too great hurry to discriminate.
They just "go-blind.”
They were off for the honeymoon, and as he had
£150 a 3 ear in the Lands a placard notice "engaged''
in big letters of course hung from the window of thiir
railway compartment. Hut the people who looked
through the window and saw them looked in by them-
selves, said that they ought to bo not only engagedjbut
married.
A man at Lord Howe’s Island had two wives.
But when a resident magistrate was sent there, it was
pointed out to him that such a surplus of joy was not
strictly legal—that, in fact, except in the case of Czars or
royal gentlemen, it was even immoral. A domestic
consult ation was at once held, the result being that ho
was united in the orthodox manner to one, while the
other signed the register as witness 1 And she now
washes the dishes and the children.
At a pretty Englieh-looking village in the Mait-
land district tney have a Post-office and an inquisitive
Postmistress. A wag called into the office one cay with
a letter addressed to a young lady in a neighbouring
township. He handed the letter to the Postmistress,
accompanied by an open letter, with the remark that
'• he thought it best to bring a copy of it, as he didn’t
want the envelope of the original letter knocked about.”
There have been few letters tampered with in that office
siuee.
They were in a largo carriage, off for the honey*
moon, and when the train stopped fl tevn minutes for
refreshment, some mischievoua travellers put up a
peddler to go and offer the bridegroom a lot of baby’s
rattles. Ho made all sorts of excuses, but the peddler
persisted. At last the embarrassed beuediot burst out,
•• Look here. I’ve only been married four hours. Give
ns a rest. Keep your rattles till next year, and then, If
the returns are satisfactory, 1T1 ," and then a hand
was put on his mouth, and, amid smothered laughter all
over the oar, a voice «aid in hie ear, *• Don’t be a fool 1”

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
Criokot of late has been the same thing “ over”
aud “ over’’ again.
Mr. T. T. Jenner has been appointed Secretary
to the Adelaide Tattersall’s.
The Greyhound Melforb was recently purchased
in England oy Mr. Chirnside for £400.
Edward Hanlan received .£200 for acting as
judge in tha recent six days’ competition at New York.
The Victorian wrestlers, Victor and Graham,
have been matched to wrestle in five weeks for £20 a
side.
It is stated that Lord Charles Beresford, the
English turfman and gentleman-]ockey, will try his
luck on the American Turf.
At the Kiama show, the throe prizes offered for
competition amongst lady riders were won by tho Misses
Tate, Weston, aud M’Carbcry,
A sculling match in club skiffs has been
arranged between Messrs, Ickerson aud Finlaysou of
the ll.E.C. and M.It.C. respectively.
Oatmeal (3 yrs ), an English horse, by Wild
Oats out of Refinement, has been re-named Mrs. Lang-
try. Not very flattering to the Lily on the paternal
side.
At the Haywood Races (Vic.), myriads of grass-
hoppers swarmed all over the course, and the active
insects rattled against the persons of those present
during the afternoon in anything but a pleasant
manner.
Billy Murdoch, the champion batsman, has, we
are afraid, had his day. Every man, we have heard it,
remarked, has his day Billy is getting too fat. Fat
is the word Massie’s batting, on the other ha.-.d, is
getting very thin.
The “ Coming Cricket Club” is the modest title
of a new club lately formed on tho Manning River. We
suppose this is a facetious reference to the reliability of
the members to be on the spot when the corned beef
and carrot banquet is spread in the marquee.
At the making of the match between O’Leary
and Elwards, Raynor was present, and stated his will-
ingness to take part in a hundred pound sweepstake,
but he could not manage £200 at present. He expressed
his intention, however, to have a go at the winner.
An Ipswich (Q ) firm refused to give their em
ployees a holiday uu the day whan the cricket match
against the English came off They refused on the
grounds that cricket is worse than horse-racing, because
it leads to betting and swindling. This is hard upon
horse-racing.
The challenge by the Victorian champion pro-
fessional bicycle rider, J. Roife, to run at a month’s
notioa any two men in Australia tho distance of twenty
miles, tho two riders to change every alternate five
miles, for £20 aside or upwards, has bean taken up by
Messrs. Thomas and Irish.
The latest regulation of theV.R.C., fixing the
minimum handicap weight at 6st. 7lb., is likely to prove
pretty rough on three-year-olds that have done well as
two-year-olds, particularly in races extending beyond a
mile and a half Nevertheless, it wi'l probably bo
adopted all over Victoria.
The following are the entries received for the
Handicap Outrigger Raoo on tne ClarenceTrickett,
Lsrgan, Messenger, Beach, Perkins, from Sydney; A.
Campbell, Richmond River; D. M’Donald, N. M’Donald,
A. Baker, Clarence River. Tho steam companies have
agreed to carry competitors at half fares.
The Adelaide Racing Club have issued the pro-
gramme for their May meeting to be run on 19th, 24th,
and 26th of that month. The three richest items are—
The Queen’s Birthday Cap, of 500 so vs., with sweep of
10 sovs., and 100 sovs Gold Cup added. If mile, and City
Handicap of 250 sovs., with sweep of 5 sovs., 1 mile.
A sarcastic London journalist some time ago
suggested that duelling should be substituted for foot-
ball as the winter pastime of young men at home.
Whereupon a still more sarcastic journalist observed
that duelling would not do, as " our youngsters still
prefer a sport that contains some slight element of
excitement and danger.”
A Mr. Turner, of Boggabri, wrote a letter
lately to the Gunuedah Jockey Club, recommending it
to make a charge to ail bookmakers who attended the
races. His suggestion was not adopted. We think the
Oiutj was quite right in rejecting it. We have no
sympathy with gratuitous exhibitions of spite against
the clergy.
Coursing seems to have seen its best days in the
olonies. Over at Melbourne a week or two ago some
splendid greyhounds, whieh not so very far back would
have fetched 30 or 40 guineas each, were sold for an
average of about ten guineas each. We think it is a
pity to let this fine sport die out. We did not consult
the hates when we were forming this opinion. Perhaps
their sentiments are different.
Melbourne racing men are getting the American
trotting mania as badly as even the Americans them-
selves. Five hundred sovereigns is the amount of the
prize offered by the Victorian Trotting Club for the
leading trotting event at its next Elstornwiok meet n/.
In addition to this, three 100 sov. prizes are to be given
for flat and jump races. These are to attract those
who have not yet been struck with the trotting mania.
Fred. Archer, upon his marriage with Miss
Dawson, was presented by the Master of Arbnthnot,
Lord Lurgan. Mr Leopold Rothschild, Sir Matthew
Wood, the Hon. K. Grosvenor, Viscount Cole, M.P.,
and Major Powell, with a testimonial, consisting of a
service of plate for 25 persons, together with a tea and
coffee service. Every article is of solid silver, save the
knives, tha handles of which are ivory.
The French sportsman, Count de Lagrange, has
sold most of his stud, but intends carrying on the
business of the turf with a remnant of his racers, and
has formed a new society,.into which it is said that a
)ady, belonging to the highest French aristocracy, and
possessing sporting tastes, namely, the Duchess d’Uzes,
has determined to enter, being tempted, no doubt, to
dabble in racing after the fashion sot by the Duchess of
Montrose, in England.
Tho price obtained at a London show for tho
prize bull-dog, Lord Nelson, who had won every cup for
which he ever competed, was £225. His aspect is des-
cribed as that of the “ most unprincipled ruffian that
ever ran on four legs to help his master in the attack
on a helpless traveller on a starlight night.” His coat
is milb-whito, his eyes red and blood shot, his chops
fall down on each side of his jaw. and when he raise*
his lips and shows his teeth, the spectators draw back
in terror.
The Brisbane Union Cricket Club are on the
look-out for a professional cricketer. They offer good
wages—we beg pardon, sala-y. Ho will be introduced
into fashionable society, and have tbs enirie to Govern-
meut House. No ball will be considered complete
without him. It won’t matter if he doesn’t know
where to hide his hands and can’t speak English. If he
eats with his knife aud picks his teeth with Uis fork,
these acts will be looked upon as pleasant eccentricities.
All men are equal, you know.
A short while since, Lord Sefton and party
killed 7674 head of game in five days. This is what
they call sport. Yet it would be a great, deal more ex-
citing pastime to go out in the preserves with a tin
deooy and an old boot, and slaughter tho poor things
that way. And it is worthy (or unworthy) of remark
in oonnootion with these wholesale butcheries, that not
a single head of gamo over finds its way to a charitable
institution. Even though tha Quean give* her “oast
linon " to the hospitals, she does not send the patients
any pheasants. It’s not the fashion.
O’Leary’s visit to the colonies was no doubt
caused by the fact that the craze for long-distance walk,
ing is fast dying out in America aud England As we
stated in a former issue, Rowoll and Hazael, two Cracks
at this sport, broke down completely, both from affec-
tions of the heart, and wa certainly fail to see what
pleasure can be derived from watching unfortunates
trudging footsore and weary, round a ring for six days.
After the sickening spectacles at the old Exhibition
Building, we were in hopes these brutal long distance
contest* were a thing of the past in Australia. Where
is Miss Phillips ?
A London Sporting paper publishes some verses
on steeplechasing, one of which runs thus : —
“Down south over fences of fallen timber,
Tha course marked out by some gaudy rag’,
Australian horse*, sore foot and limber,
Bear the far-off squatter between the fligs."
The genius who wrote this evidently knows all about it.
Wo oould write suoh verses if we liked, only we don’t
like, because of a weak desire wa have to die in our beds
And this is London journalism I
An hour’s walking match at London, between
Eaby, the ex amateur, and Franks, the man who can-
not walk less than eight mile* in th* hour, respited in
a somewhat easy victory for Etby. who covered 8 miles
171 yards in the hour, which i* just one yard short of
the distance covered by Qrifflu, aud therefore one yard
short of what soma people suppose to bo tha best
English record Pranks finished nbont e. hundred yards
behind Raby. These records need investigation. Kaby,
like most other men who are brekon in to show pace at
nil hazards, has completely los" the style which so dis.
tingnishad him when ho won the amateur champion-
ship.
Wa are sorry to notice that tho mongrel races
for open boats, limiteh to seven hands, are coming into
fashion with the S.A S O and the regatta committees.
At the Anniversary Regatta, tho 21-foot race wa*
scarcely noticed, owing to its having bicn ono of those
limited races whieh tffaotaally outs oat tho true
shallow centreboard boats—such as tb.i Curlotta aud
Victor —from the racing, and encourages the antiquated,
deep, ballast carrying i raft*. The owners of these boats
must have great inti teuoe with tho National Regatta
Committee to induce them to substitute a mongrel race
for what has hitherto be«m the most interesting sailing
contest of tha day—the 24 footers, with best and best
skippers and crews.
Here is a wonderful story from America
Maagher aud Driscoll walked for tho one hour’s cham-
pionship and 250 dollars a side on a track eight limes
round to the mile, under most desperate conditions of
wind and weather, and both are returned a* walking
over eight miles in the time specified. “ When time
was called it was found Meagher had accomplished 8
miles 302 yards in the hour, while Driscoll bad also
gone 47 yards over the eight miles." Meagher’s time
for the eight miles was 58min 37seo. only. This is tho
first time that eight miles has ever been walked, or said
to have been walked, inside 59min. Perkins walked
eight mile* in 59 min. 5seo. Griffin is said to have
walked 8 miles 172 yards in tho hour. So Meagher com-
pletely eolipses both records. But the most extra,
ordinary part of the story is yet to come. “ Driscoll
bad ioioles hanging from his nose and corners of his
mouth, so you may guess what kind of air they were
pumping into their lungs for an hour.” The walking is
said by several good authorities to have been perfectly
fair.
They have been talking in tha States of arrang-
ing a fight between Jem Mace and Sullivan. Jem Mace
is now 52 years old, has fought and boxed one hundred
times, and weighs 224 lb. At hi* age he cannot train
to a reasenable weight without lass of that vitality
which is so necessary to oarrv a man through a hard
fight. And further, Jem Mace knows all this better than
any ono else, and he has not tho remotest idea of fight-
ing Sullivan a regular battle. He simply says that
Sullivan cannot knock him out ia four rounds, and he
will stand in front of the Bostonian for that length of
time for as big a stake as he can raise. Mace makes no
pretension that he will whip Sullivan; he simply says
that the champion bully cannot whip him with the
gloves, nor can any man living. Now, this only amounts
to an exhibition, but it will probably create as great a
furore af the biggest fight ever fought, for it will deter-
mine whether or not Sullivan really is a first-class man.
Slade, the Maori half-breed, whom Mace is now chaperon-
ing and instructing, and who is the long distance foot-
raoer and jumper and wrestler of New Zealand, is to
fight Sullivan as soon as a match can be made.
The English Eleven don’t really deserve all the
insults they get. Look at this one taken out of Mel.
bourne Punch :—
“ With him come his comrades to help, to help;
With willow and leather to help, to help;
And as he has well won,
So each man has well done
His best and his smartest to skolp, to skelp.
The army of Murdoch to skelp."
Let us try one
Why out this sad doggerel drag,
You poor liitie wearisome wag F
The stuff “ is a sin ’’ —
Bligh’ll say, with a grin,
That Punch is a sick little rag!
Varied.
Why risk all the Britishers’ chaff
With this outcome of brains of a oaltF
They with you won't grin.
You can oat any “tin”—
But it’s at your dull Punch they will laugh.
Being interviewed by a newspaper-man at St.
John, N. B Wallace Boss unbosomed himself freely.
Being asked if he favoured large sums as stake money,
he made the following sensible reply: ”N', loo not.
It is nonsense for Hanlan to propose suoh large stakes
as he does. No man in America but Hanlan oould raise
sufficient money to put into a race of £1000, as Hanlan
has often wanted. I think when there is more than
£200 on each man in a race it is likely to make h im dis-
honest. Championship races are usually rowed for less
than half that large amount, and, besides, suoh a big
sum is too much to risk on the breaking of an oar or a
trifling accident. I back myielf, and have for several
of my latest matches. I don't care to lose mere than
£200. I have to backer, so if men lose on me it is not
through the main stakes." B*garding the idea of a
sweepstakes race, each sculler to put up £2.0. which
has recently been put in print, and which Hanlan
favours, Ross said : “ I do not think it would give satis-
faction. Two men from the same school might bother
the others engaged in the race, and then tha object
aimed at would be lost. Then £200 is too much money
to stake in that way. The best way, in my mind, to test
the capabilities of au oaisoian ia to put mm in a match
race Then there will b* no mistake, and there oan be
no collusion between inferior men 10 ’jockey,’which
would likely follow in a sweepstakes race ; any more
than two men in a contest is a crowd. 1 should not
di air i go into such a regatta.”
In December last died John Day, tho foremost
trainer of his time. In his younger jookey days ha was
described by one of [the best sporting writers of that
period as being “as fine a horseman for power, seat,
and science as ever held n bridle." But it was as master
of the famous Danebury stables that he will bo known
in the annals of racing while racing exists. He is n
part of the eventful history of that most successful and
most unfortunate of establishment*, concerning wbioh
au English writer says :—“ At Danebury we had to
speak of the place one year as being supported by only
two man, owning about half a dozen horses, aud the
next year of it as keeping a hundred or more horses in
training, belonging to the salt of tha earth and carrying
all before them.” One season, when the stable had had
very bad luck, a Mr. Woysford appeared as owner of one
or two minor raoe-horses, The following year this
gentleman was more fully, if inconveniently, known ns
• • Henry Weysford Charles Plantngenet Eawdon
Hastings, fourth and last Marquis of Hastings, and
ninth Earl of Loudoun ” The Danebury stable then
became almost invincible. But bis Lordship lived at
the rate of a hundred thousand a year on an income of
fifteen thousand, and was a fearful plunger into the
bargain. There being no science of arithmetic discovert.’ 1
as yet to reconcile these figures, the Marquis went
broke —dead broke—and had to soil all his horses. Th' U
the Danebury stable broke, and old John Day’s heart
broke with it. Still ho might bo seen at race meeting’s,
a portly figure, but not tha man he was, until lately.
And lately he died like a man.

There is the usual row over the pair oar skiffii-
in the regatta—.ha money having been awarded to
Trickett and Lynch, who finished 200 yards behind
Layoock and Largan 1 Tricked; and his mate “claimed
a foul” off Shark Inland, which was allowed by Mr.
Garvan (a nautical ump re whoso only misfo- tune is to bo
an M.L. A ) I.ayoook, inprotesting againstthis decision
writes a furious letter to the Herat, d, in which ho
accuses Trickett of trying in every way u> foul his boat,
aud not succeeding With this, however, we have
nothing to do, having long been completely "fall" of
all tha aquatic heroes who figured in tha contest.
“Charon" of the Matt, however, quotes from boat-
raoing bye-laws and proves that n > party should be dis-
qualified lira foul that d'd not iutoifeio with tho actual
result of the contest. Well, so fur a* tha race want,
Trickett and Lynch wars outpaced all through, and,
therefore to put it mildly, it would have been a wiser
course to have made them row over again. There
are numberless people who vay there was no foul at all,
but, whichever way it may be, all this proves incontest-
ably that the fearfully bad feeling tint exists amongst
cricketers has extended itself to scullers. Personally
tho whole thing bores us very much indeed, sculling as
it is now carried on being to a great extent a game
at which the biggest "general’ nearly always w,ns. A ra-
mirkable feature in tho case is the insertion of Layoock’s
letter in tha Herald —that style of commit ideation being
hitherto invariably declined by that j nirnal Perhapi
this proves something, aud perhaps it doesn’t. A. lot of
people think it does We hive no time to think about
it at all. Meanwhile Liyoook nurses his anger and
Edward nurses the money.
The Oscar Wilde of sporting literature lives in
a little town called Houalla, whion has up till now only
been celebrated for its cheese. There was a cricket
match up there on wbat he grandly designates “ the
natal day of New South Wales," and he sat himself
down to desoribo'it. His description is indescribable.
Very fall of sweetness and musical sunshine—and some
unknown tongue—is his opening paragraph about how
everyone “turned out to partake in the ‘ejmglerie en
masse." " There is no mention of any spoons being
missed afterwards, so we suppose this can’t mean hash.
With infinite tenderness he touches upon tho fact that
the local team got badly “licked;’’ with mystic joy
ho mentions that at lunch “tho tables were really
recherche, and made yon imagine that you were about
epulis accumbocre divum ” (this moans that you feel yon
have a jammed fine obanoe to gratuitously “tuck in"
enough oorne I beef to last you till the next quarter’s
subscriptions are due, and you don’t mean to let it
slide), and then he sweeps the strings of hi* kerosene-
tin to other strains, and bursts out into melody like the
bubbling musio of the bulbul sieging in some Shiraz
grove over the “ beaus and belles," who wore, it seams,
“ gaily tripping lightly as they go, upon the light
tastic too " Now, this is what we call floe, embroidered
gold-laced writing. The concluding paragraph, how.
ever, is a pearl. When the perspiring Damons and
Phyllises— cow gods and cheese nymphs—had finished
churning up the hash they had hidden, they moved for
home. Does he state this fact in simple fustian
fashion F Listen to this : They moved “ when Q leen
Venus and Ate could no longer hold sway ever Comus
and fair Hecate, aud the fast approach of Aurora was
appearing in the east." This is good mythology—good
bntterman’s mythology. Tha writer is evidently an
experienced churn-alist. It seems a pity, however, that
be was born with a cheese on hi* shoulders. We would
not advise him to come up to Sydney—the Rum re-
porters would make Welsh rabbits of hi* head before
he was in the town ten minutes.
Mr. W. G. George, the champion English
amatmr, who defeated the American flyer, Myers, can,
given a good day and fair condition, run three quaitars
of a mile in 3 min. 4 so. And those who knowmoit
about him feel certain that under the excitement of a
public race—an excitement which always makes a reaby
good man better than he is in his trial—ha would, if
pushed by a worthy opponent, get well inside these
figures Notwithstanding this, Myers has ex praised
great anxiety to visit England again, and, properly
trained, recommence conclusions with George. What
is more, one of Myers’s staunchest supporters has
pledged himself to pay all expense*, travel with him,
and carefully look after his interests. Notwithstanding
his victories, George’s recollections of An erica are
bound to be anything but pleavant. He having spoken
his mindtio freely when Myers declined lorun the
three-quarter mile race as originally arranged, was
pulled up with a round turn. He all at once discovered
he was in a country where freedom of speech is only
allowed those who belong to the establishment. The
Manhattan Club took sirious umbrage at words ua=d by
George in a private conversation, and refused to allow
another race between the two great amateurs, unless
the Englishman apologised unconditionally. Among
the wicked expressions George had to admit having
made, was one to the effect that he did not believe
Myers was ill, as he was out and about, and looked as
well as ever. Another charge against him, and one he
could not evade either, was that ne called tue members
of the Manhattan Club “a mean and unmanly lot."
Ultimately, George apologised and the race took place.
Although they all knew Myers was sick, the Manhattan
fellows kept piling the money on him, aud up to the
last he t Id some men who had as much as eight
hundrel and a thousand dollars each on him not to
hedge; which they oould have done at evens then. So
that Mr. Myers, who in the pedestrian world seemed to
be what Hanlan was in aquatics, has evidently been
fair y licked on his merits."
Jem Mace, passing through ’Frisco, gave an
exhibition of boxing, and showed off his lialt-oaste
Maori pupil, Slade, at Kalloch’s Metropolitan Temple.
Kallooh, by the way, is the rev. gentleman (he is a Bap-
tist clergyman) whose son shot dead Charles do Young,
one of the proprietors of the S.F. Chronicle. Speak-
ing of the Slade-Maoe sparring show, a local paper
sayst “ Eallooh’s Temple has just been put to the only
honest use to wntoh it has beau applied in its wuuie
history. To be sure, it is not a very moral or ennobling
sight to witness two men pounding each other's faces
into jellies, and beyond all recognition. Images
fashioned after the semblance of their Maker, might be
turned to much better uses. Pugilism is brute force
parsonilled. It is as appeal to the lower as opposed to
the higher instincts of our nature. It is disgusting,
brutish, aud unworthy of the refinement, intellect, and
sfood sense of gentlemen. Yet, it is immeasurably
better than the pistol. It there must be an appeal to
force, it is bettor that muscle, that breaks no bones,
should decide than that there should be an appeal to
powder and load, which kill. It ware better that reason
should arbitrate in all disputes. Yet the late enter-
tainment at the Metropolitan Temple was an exception-
ally honest one compared with all that had proceeded
it in that building. There was no hypocrisy about it.
The men were what they seemed to be. They attempted
to humbug nobody. They wore no cloak, religious or
otherwise, but stripped to their skins and showed them-
selves as they were. They were loyal to their calling,
p traded in no borrowed plumes, and certainly did not
’ steal the livery of Heaven to serve tho devil in.’ They
wore honest fellows, gentleman, and even saint* com-
pared with the social leper and immoral ruffian
who, in tho name of purity, sanctity, and holiness
to the Lord, has too long defiled the place that
has more fittingly been turned in ,o a prize ring ”
As to the show itself Maoe was heavy in flash and
looked as it he would weigh a few pounds more than his
huge pupil. Tho triangular appearance of Slade was
very apparent whoa he stripped, and ho showed an
utter lack of condition, his flesh being loose and soft
and his muscle entirely hidden. His arms looked small
and light for his body, his best features being his logs
and shoulders. He and Mace went at each other in
merry fashion, but it was plain to see that Maoo was
not giving the Maori the best he had, for he made no
use of that wonderful skill with the head that has made
him famous in the ring. Slade’s right did him good
sarvioe several times, and Mace also made more use of
bis right hand than be generally does. The set-to
showed conclusively that, no matter what is Slade’s
ability as a fighter, ho is but a second-rate boxer, and
will have to improve a great deal before he is up to
championship form " Apropos, the News Letter
writes : —" Is there any other place upon the face of
the globe but San Francisco where a sparring match
could be given in a place devoted to the supposed
worship of God F We imagine not. Tho late sparring

Mr. Targett was very satirical when moving for
a committee to report, on the working of the Electoral
Act. He favours holding all the elections on one day,

some members might be left out in the cold, he said
“ there was always pome nook or corner wherein or
Whereat particular members could get in."
Wo are heartily glad that Mr. Tarpott’s motion
for the appointment of a select oommi’tco to investigate
the working (meaning the abuse) of the Electoral Aot,
was not carried. We are glad because w believe that
the subject ought to be investigated. Paradoxical ?

And still less of the federation crotchet. And least of

And again;—"It will be nofreart that we sro always

only the aristocratic Msitimer wants the moo‘»v to pay

The Chinese celebrated their New Year last
week, and proved themselves singularly hospitable. An
open house and the national smile greeted all who
visited thorn. Lavishly laid tables, where our and their
ideas of what is good for the body of man combined to
make up the feast, were there for anyone to partake ;
vases of flowers, choice wines, and moon-faoed attend-
ants, helping to complete the scene that was visible in
several ot the leading houses. And all who oame, and
who behaved, were welcome. Bat John is very sensi-
tive, and doesn’t like cads. It’s quite probable that
next year there will be a big celestial picnic.
A little while ago there was a heap of talk—a
very Iliad of words—about the desirableness of erecting
a monument over the humble grave of Australia’s
greatest orator, Daniel Henry Doniehy, and nothing
oame of it. We had thousands to spend on pleasure-
8asking prelates and upholders of our “national
honour," in the tented-field of—cricket, but the only
one who considered the Australian Cicero worth a
thought was a poor, labouring man, of Bathurst—Pat
Batter —to whom all honour. This man caught poor
Deniehy as he dropped dead in Howiok-street, he was
the first to help to carry him to his lowly grave, and
out of his own scanty earnings, he erected a little stone
to mark I he dead man’s resting place. Were we idle
all this time. Not much. We were talking. Talking
in a matter like this seems to bo our forte. We
are talking still. Last Sunday Deniehy’s mother
—who must have been over 80 years of age—was laid in
her grave. It would please us to say that thousands
seized the opportunity of paying some little respect to
her gifted son, but the fact is that only three persons
followed the cold clay of the poet’s mother. The three
were: the Hon, W. B. Dilley, Q C., Thomas Butler
(Freeman s Journal) and Mrs Beattie, wife of the land,
lord of the Gardeners’ Arms hotel, York-street, who has
long been unremitting in her attentions to the poor old
lady. Mrs. Denihay diad in Palmer-etreet. Chill

A curtain, one-twentieth of an inch thick, of woven

large pile of dry wood, saturated with tar and kerosene,

A very rising dramatist is young Pinero, author
Of “The Money Spinner,” which was produced here bv
Wybert Reeve .some time ago, “ The Squire,” and
several more c. r less—successful plays. He is only 28
year of age Four years ago he was nobody. We mean
comparatively nobody. He was then playing with
Irving at the Lyceum, and was chiefly remarkable for
his O' son-like appearance on the stage We remember
h m well when he was a prominent “first-nighter”—a
class of play-goer belonging to what Dion Boucicanlt
describes as an organised gang who attend the pro-
auction of all important plays with the apparent obieot
of seizing on eny opportunity of creating a diveision
of the attention of the public from the entertainment
on the stage to a. performance in the pit.” But Dion
is spea! iag of “first-nighters” as they are now, not as
they were five or six years ago. Then they were
f. tfce *J tl T, e », and idling to allow for the
inevitah.e faults of a first performance. Pinero has not
an imposing presence He is low-statured and thin
But hiis nose is a nightmare. It is of the Aztec order'
starting from the nndd eof his forehead and throwing
a, clear coarse into space down to within a quarter of an
