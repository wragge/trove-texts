THE THUD OF CLODS.
There is no horror in the oblong hole.
Kind Mother Earth, unmourning and serene,
Parts lovingly her dress ;of gentle green,
Naked to hold you to her naked soul.
The undertaker nods—
He wants, poor man, to get home to his tea.
And then begins the final liturgy,
Am? Head March played malignantly—
The bleak —dead —thud—of—clods.
A job’s a job. The workmen shovel in
The sodden soil. Unwise for you to stay
To watch them draw my coverlet of clay,
Close, comfortably close, up to my chin,
And top me off with sods.
But I shall be from all impatience rid,
And planted out of hearing*, nicely hid,
I shall not hear unon my coffin lid v
The bleak—dead—thud—of—clods.
A funeral’s a farce to all but one;
And he, perhaps, though lying there, looks
on
Impatient till the actors all are gone,
And all the dreary mummery is done.
But, God !—or, maybe, Gods !
Among those crows that crowd the grave-
yard gate
May there be none I love, round me to wait
To hear that final good-bye desolate—
The bleak-—dead—thud—of—clods.

ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
The New Encyclopaedia Britannica
When The Times entered upon-its famous
publishing campaign it fired at an unoffend-
ing public a ton or so of printed matter
labelled “Encyclopedia Britannica,” which
was at dh'at date very inadequate as a
work of reference* It was pecessary to
.-warn Australians then that many subjects
of importance were not treated at all, and
that much of the information supplied in
that edition was. so far out of*date as to-
be useless. The first volume of the.ninth
edition was issued in 1875, and the last in
1889, so that at the date of The-Times re-
print (1898) some of the articles were over
20 years old. The gulf was bridged in a
fashion by supplementary volumes pub :
lished in 1902, which, with the previous col-
lection, mads the tenth edition.
The Cambridge University Press then took
over Encyclopaedia Britannica, and has had
it enlarged, revised, and largely re-written.
The information is brought up to the latter
part of 1910, and the whole 28 volumes have
been printed at the same time. This
eleventh edition is, therefore, virtually a
new work. A few articles on subjects which
are not seriously affected by Time, such as
that on “Poetry,” by Watts-Dunton, have
been reprinted from the ninth . edition; but
all the old articles have undergone revision
where necessary,, and the major part of the
work is new.
The new Encyclopaedia has about twice
as much 1 matter as the ninth edition, and
so far as one can test it, there are no serious
omissions or inaccuracies. It is perhaps
strongest on the scientific, side. From “aero-
nautics” to “zoology” the student will get
the latest facts and the most competent
opinions. A history of the world is scat-
tered through its pages—articles like that
on Aegean civilisation giving the results of
the most recent excavations, with plates
which show that the ladies of Cnossus in
8.c.-anything-you-like had wasp waists and
wore flounced skirts ; while the story of Por-
tugal is brought down to the revolution last
year. Articles on such subjects .as beards,
ceramics, newspapers, the Boer war and
many other wars, biographies of the Borgias,
Napoleon (by J. Holland Rose), Hogarth
(by Austin Dobson) and many other nota-
bilities provide varied and interesting read-
ing for anyone who takes it up for enter-
tainment. And, in the India-paper edition,
the volumes are as handy to read as the
paper-covered novel.
At first sight it seemed strange to find the
battle of Valley Forge treated at reasonable
length, while Valrny did not appear at all.
But a reference to the excellent Index
volume sent the enquirer to the battß of
Valmy in its place, as part of the French
Revolutionary wars. “Agadir,” which has
come into prominence recently, does not
appear in a separate article; the Index,
however, advises you to see'' “Morocco,”
where there is enough to tell you what the
little place is like. Stephen Phillips, the
poet, has a paragraph to himself; while
Arthur Phillip has to be content with a
place in the general article on Australia.
The E.B. naturally could not enter into
competition with The Dictionary of National
Biography, which ropes in all sorts of Eng-
lish-speaking notabilities, even Ned Kelly,
the iron-clad bushranger; it takes, however,
the biggest out of that multitude and adds
the important personages of other countries.
No single encyclopedia can displace many
of the special works of reference. The news-
paper office will still need its annual
gazeteers, atlases, dictionaries, etc.; the
specialist will still require the elaborate
works on his special subject. Anyone who
wished to study the history and characteris-
tics of Australia would want more than the
outlines provided by the E.B. The space
given to Australia represents its relative im-
portance in the eyes of cultured Englishmen,
and an outside reader will find all the in-
formation he is likely to require in the care-
fully written articles of T. A. CQghlan, John
Cockburn, G. C. Levey, and J. W. Gregory
(author of The Dead Heart of Australia).
W. Pember Reeves sizes up Maoriland' very
satisfactorily, and the bibliographies will
direct the earnest inquirer to the right
books:
It may fairly be claimed for the new
Encye. Brit, that it covers a wkler range of
human knowledge than any single work in
English, and covers it So well that it forms
by itself a sufficient reference library for the
general reader. The arrangement of the
material is admirable, common-sense being
the guide rather than any fixed plan ; and
the spelling of names is in accordance with
usage. The Encyclopaedia has a reputation
for literary excellence, and the new edition
establishes it more firmly than ever as an
educational institution of the highest value.
It is self-explanatory, authoritative and up-
to-date.
Translations of Verse
Lyrical poetry is compounded of such
subtle essences that most of them escape in
translation, and it is only when a foreign
poem has been born again in the brain of
another poet that a satisfactory equivalent
of the original is produced. There are few
examples in English of translation so faith-
ful in the spirit and letter as. Rossetti’s
“Ballade of Dead Ladies,” or of paraphrases
so successful as Fitzgerald’s “Rubaiyat.”
There are, however, many good, though not
great, renderings of foreign lyrics, and some
of these are collected by A. L. Gowans in
Masterpieces of Lyrical Translation (Gow-
ans and Gray, 6d. net). He has omitted some
fine versions of Sappho’s fragments, -which
are to be found in Wharton’s book, James
Thompson’s few,, but excellent songs of
Heine, and he has nothing by Andrew Lang,
Swinburne, William Ilardinge and some
others who have translated well.
Still, it is a' good sixpen’orth, with Ay-
toun and Martin’s rendering of Goethe’s
“Bride of Corinth,” the famous “Heraclitus”
by William Cory, the “Dies Irae” by Ros-
common, Gautier’s “Posthumous Coquetry”
by Arthur Symons, and -the excellent “Ars
Victrix”' of Gautier, to which Dobson did
justice, especially in the proud boast at the
end: —
. All passes. Art alone
Enduring stays to us;
The bust outlasts the throne,
The coin, Tiberius;
Even the gods must go ;
__ Only the lofty rhyme
Not countless years o'erihrow
Not long array of time.
Paris Nesbit, K.Oi, of Adelaide, has made
seme Translations from Herman Poets (Jas.
R. Tyrell), and challenges comparison with
Shelley, Theodore iuartin, Lytton and Bay-
ard Taylor, by printing, "in an appendix,
their versions of Some of his original's. Paris
Nesbit’s verse is.smooth and readable; but
it has not the felicitous touch which is to
be found even in Bayard Taylor's work oc-
casionally—-for Taylor was something of a
poet on liis own account. The book is one
qf creditable exercises in translation.
Millionaires and Misery
Charles E. Russell is a notable American
muck-raker, who has, in Lawless Wealth
and other books, exposed the methods of
legalised robbery by which many millionaires
got their boodle. Books of the kind have
been plentiful during the last ten years, and
the edge of sympathy has been somewhat
blunted by their rough workmanship. Rus-
sell stands out of the crowd as one who
sticks closely to facts,, and does not allow
his indignation to shriek.
A new volume of his essays, Why / am a
Socialist (Melville and Mullen, and Dym-
ock’s), is more varied and no less lurid
than his others.. Theoretical argument in
support of Socialism is no longer necessary;
thin-spun deductions , from assumed prin-
ciples are the sole prop of those, who, like
Bruce Smithy wish to explain “Why I am
not a Russell simply tells a
number of true stories of the struggle for
existence, and adds a few remarks to drive
the moral home. “Here are the facts,” lie
says, in effect; “sufficiently damnable, aren’t
they? Where wealth accumulates in the
hands of a few it is inevitable that men
decay. And there is no remedy but Social-
ism.”
A typical story is that of the Bucko Mate.
This officer treated the men with systematic
brutality, in order to make them desert at the
end of the voyage. Then another crew would
be “shanghaied” (as in the days of the press
gang), and the same miserable business car-
ried out again. The first mate in sea yarns
is usually distinguished for cruelty; but
fiction cannot show more callous savagery
than that of this genuine “bucko mate.” Off
duty, he was a mild-mannered man, who re-
gretted that it was under pressure from the
owners that the ship was turned into a float-
ing hell.
When in Sydney, Russell and a friend
visited the Art Gallery. They noticed a
sculptured bust which Russell thought was
a representation of a well-known million-
aire, X; but his friend identified it as
millionaire Y. On closer inspection, they
found a legend stating that it stood for “The
Founder of Islam—a man conspicuous for
cruelty, avarice, selfishness and cold sen-
sualism.” The artist had tried to make a
face expressive of these qualities, and had
made one that looked like an American mil-
lionaire.
A Good Story of Larrikin Life
Although the Australian larrikin has not
been overlooked by local writers, he has not
hitherto received such careful attention as
that which Neil Lyons gave to the London
slum-dweller. Scenes from the life of Pusli-
dom have been dragged into several novels
The King of the Rocks and Tfie Great Push
Experiment tried to be sensational, and did
not have the advantage of being funny. Dy-
son’s. Fact'ry ’Ands add Benno are im-
aginative creations with a liberal coating of
local color. It does not matter that Benno
and his pals are too good to be true, or that
the Fact’ry is run for the sole purpose of
affording them low-comedy situations —-the
’Ands are a treat.
Louis Stone, the author of Jonah
(Methuen, per Angus and Robertson), has
evidently studied the Sydney larrikin in his
lair. He has got a few choice barbarians
and a typical mean street into his book, with
some characteristic episodes of Push life.
The first part of the book is true of a
time which ended 15 or 20 years ago, when
larrikins hunted in packs, and maintained a
reign of terror in some parts of the city.
The Saturday-night parade, the “two-up
school,” Paddy’s Market and other scenes
are drawn faithfully and humorously. A
continuity of interest is preserved by the
rise of Jonah, king of the push, to prosperity
as a Boot King, his domestic troubles, and
his love for the shabby-genteel music-teacher.
Except that it is not finished off neatly, the
story is skilfully managed, and the author
makes a very creditable first appearance.
A number of the secondary characters are
life-like. Mr. Fowles, alias “Chook,” is the
representative larrikin, and his courting of
Pinkey makes one of the best chapters in
the book. Pinkey’s spirited repartee had
excited. Chook’s admiration, and he became
her “steady company.”. The girl’s suffer-
ings at the hands of Sarah, her stepmother,
completed his conquest:—
“Yous doh’t think any worse o’ me ’cause
Lil’s crook, do you?” she asked piteously.
Chook swore a denial.
“P’raps yer think it runs in the fam’ly;
but Lil ’ud ’a’ gone straight'if ’adn’t
been driven out o’ the ’ouse by Sarah’s nasty
tongue.” '
Chook declared that Lil was spotless.
“No she ain’t,” said Pinkey, “she’s, as bad
as they make ’em’ now; but...wot makes
yer tail up after me?” she enquired sud-
denly.
Chook answered that she had sent him
fair off his dot.
"Oh, yes,’ that’s what yer said to Poll
Corcoran,' an’ then went skitin’ that she’d
do anythin’ yer liked if yer lifted yer finger.
I’ve ’eard all about yous,”
Chook swore that he would never harm
a hair of her head:
“The WTst ‘arm is done without meanin’
it,” said Pinkey. wisely, “an’ that’s w’y I’m
frightened of yer.”
“Wotcher got ter be frightened o’ me,”
asked Chook, softly.
“I’m frightened o’ yer...’cause I like
yer,” said Pinkey, bursting into tears.
Louis Stone is to be congratulated upon
Mrs. Yabsley, the fat laundress who lived
in Cardigan-street, Waterloo, and thought it
the hub of the universe.
“My ’usband used ter take me to the play
before we was married ; but I never see any
play equal ter wot ’appens in this street, if
yer only keeps yer eyes open... I can’t
read myself, bein’ no scholar, but I can see
that books an’ plays is fer them as ain’t
got no eyes in their ’eads.”
“Funny, ain’t it? This street is .more like
a ’uman bein’ ter me than plenty I know.
Yer see. I can’t regd the paper an’ see ’oo’s
bin married an’ murdered through the week,
bein’ no scholar; but I can read Cardigan-
street like a book. An’ I've found that wot
’appens in this street ’appens everywhere
else if yer change the names and addresses.”
Her efforts to beguile Jonah into marrying
her daughter, Swhom he had seduced, were
highly diplomatic. When she saw that he
was . almost hooked by the child, she played
the line a little:—
“No, Joe, I don’t mind sayin’ that I ’ad
some idea of marryin’ volis an’ Ada. but
ye’re not the man I took yer for, an’ I give
it up. I don’t believe in a man marryin’
because ’e wants a woman ter cook ’is meals.
My idea is a man wants ter git married be-
cause ’e’s found out a lot of surprisin’ things
in the world ’e never dreamt of before. ..
I tell yer tlfe best things in life are them yer
can’t see at all, an’ that’s the feelin’s. So
take a fool’s advice, an’ don’t think of
marryin’ till yer feel there’s somethin’ wrong
wi’ yer inside, fer that’s w’ere it ketches
yer.”
Fictlon—Wid, Weird and Mi Id
H. G. Wells has selected from early
volumes all of his short stories “that I care
for anyone to read again,” added five new
ones, and published them in one book —The
Country of the Blind and Other Stories
(Angus and Robertson), Irt a prefatory
note Wells protests against somebody’s con-
demnation of the aneddote —“the short story
is Mappassant; the anecdote is damnable” —
and. claims that a short story is anything
moving or delightful in fiction which can be
read in something under an hour. That is
the popular definition, and it applies to the
contents of this book. Some of the early
Cone,” “The Purple Pileus,”
and Davidson’s Eyes’’- are sufficiently
moving, and will stand more than one read-
ing. "A Vision of Judgment,” “The Door in
the Wall,” and “The Country of tjie Blind,”
amongst the new yarns, are delightful and
the best Wells has written. There are as
many fantastic, weird and extraordinary
notions as could well be got into one book,
and they are dressed up with rare skill.
The small circle of novel readers to whom
sensation is of less importance than style
will welcome the utter simplicity of Martha
Vine (Dymock’s). The story is that of an
emotional, pure-minded girl, the daughter
of a country clergyman, who is very much
in, love with love. She invests her affection
in one ypung man, who does not pay .divi-
dends, as he has selected her sister. Then
she receives the worshipful courtship of a
farmer, and the developments are set forth
in a naive way as if Martha Vine were re-
porting them without any consciousness of
the reader. There is no straining after
effect—even the effect of simplicity as in
Marie Claire. Such austerity is uncommon
amongst the women writers of to-day, and
its nearest model is Jane Austen.
The author’s name does not appear on the
title page of Martha Vine; but an advt.
states that it is Viola Meynell, one of a
clever family. Wilfred Meynell is the editor
of The Dublin Review, his vi-ife Alice is a
poet and anthologist, and three of their
children, including Viola, contributed to
Ryes of Youth, a recent collection of in-
teresting verse. , . .■’ \
Perhaps the clarity and stillness of Martha
Vine would be appreciated most if taken
after a book like ■ The Trail of ’ 9B, by the
Canadian Kipling, Robert W. Service
(Dymock’s). The garish colors of his Verse
reappear in the, prose yarn. The strenuous
life of the adventurers in the Yukon, the
passionate love of the hero for Rerna, Lo-
casto’s rivalry and her renunciation are told
with a rush and whirl of words appropriate
to the Wild. The energy of Service is mag-
but his yarn is pitched in so high a
key that one’s ear is tired before the end.
“J.H.M.A.”: Died, on the 23rd Septem-
ber, John Arthuy Barry—sailor, bushman,
author and journalist. Not many weeks ago
the “Red Page" gave its attention to his
place in Australian literature, and came to
the conclusion that it is a pretty high-up
one. It is. Had Barry, possessed even the
slightest genius for advertisement, his sea
stories might have been as widely read as
Clark Russell’s or F. T. Bullen’s. But he
was a master of sound .workmanship, rather
than an exploiter of the workmanship of
sound. Faithfulness and honesty were the
keynotes of all he, wrote, and he shrank
from anything that looked like literary log-
rolling. lie was a man who was entirely
lovable- —one, of those gentle souls who did
not know how enemies were made —and there
are many and widely diverse sorts of peo-
ple who feel that the world isn’t quite as
good a place without him as it was before
he went.
“Clarence O’ Hagan” : Why do the poets
follow the evil example set by Ruskin, and
other back numbers, and call their volumes
by bumble-bee-luring titles like Sesame and
Lilies, Roses and Ranunculus, and Wattle
and Wallflower? Let them be practical in
these incomparable commercial days; let
them come , forth with a solid, satisfying
title that will appeal to the butcher and the
baker—something that will make the draper
stop and look, and the soap-boiler, and the
tomato : sauce man ponder, and put their
hands in their pockets, and go in and get a
half-crown’s worth. I rise to contribute a
few suggested titles for the forthcoming
works of Australia’s Noblest Bards:—
Sirloins of Beef and Other Joints, by
Randolph Bedford.

“C. Ockney”: “Jean Sibi” sums Zangwill
up neatly (“Red Page” 14/9/T1) in the
phrase, “he thinks in the grandiose and
writes in fanfares.” Israel, also —alas! —
talks in puns! I heard him-r-but forgave,
remembering that he once edited a comic
paper. I.Z. was best described —in my
hearing, by a prominent London journalist—
as “a Salmon and Gluckstein Meredith” ;
Salmon and Co. being an Israelitish firm of
cut-price tobacco merchants with shops all
over England.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Two Boats.
I builded a pearly boat,
All in the moonlight clear,
On the Sea of Stars to float
When Sorrow would hold me here.
Her sails they were silver-white ;
White was each slender spar ;
And she bore, as masthead-light,
A little blue-sparkling star.
The helmsmen twain I sought,
Came, with deep eyes a-gleam;
And , the name of one was Thought—
The other his name was Dream.
Then unto my boat I said:
“Psyche your name shall be.
And when Care draws near my bed,
We sail for the Starry Sea.”
And unto my Love spake I,
Saying: “O, sweet and dear !
Come with me in my boat and fly
Fom Sorrow that haunts us here.
“Afar we shall sail, afar—
Over the ocean lone,
Where the great star-angels are
Each throned on his shining throne.
“And we shall be borne, maybe,
Borne on that stream of sonf
The Eternal harmony
That carries the suns along.
“And ’see the sad stars, grown old,
Dying out, one by one;
And the Rose of the Worlds behold
The Mystical Central Sun.
“Have never a fear,” said I,
“Surely the star I know,
Unto which, when the moon’s on high,
The beautiful dream-ships go.”
My Love shook her dear, bright head,
Shook it so tenderly:
“I have also a boat,” she said,
“A boat of my own,” said she.
“Her prow is a red-beaked swan,
Cordage like silk has she,
And the winds they play thereon
A marvellous melody.
“A melody made of sighs,
Sad as the sob of seas,
. And the . laughter of laughing eyes,
And magic, and mysteries.
“She’s all as, a ruby red ;
Rose-red the flag she flies
At her delicate, tall masthead;
But never she sails the skies.
“She seldom is seaward-bound—
Little she cares to roam—
But is evermore coasting round
The dear little port called Home.
“I builded her strong and well,
Perfect in ev’ry part:
If her name you would have me tell—
My dear, she is called The Heart.
“So leave you your pearly boat,
Wondrous as she may be,
On the Starry Sea to float,
And come in my boat with me.”
I left my boat that I made
All in the moonlight pale,
Ere the stars began to fade —-
And now in The Heart I sail.
But oft when the silver moon
Sails through the sky above,
And the winds sing a mystic rune,
And dreams are around my Love,
I kiss her sweet eyelids pale,
Leaving her wrapt in sleep,
And unmoor my boat, and sail —
Alone —on the Starry Deep.
VICTOR J. DALEY.
Hours.
But once the summertide was turned they sailed
away the ships,
Whose freight was love, and hours of love, and
kisses on the lips. ..
Yet, when across the floor of night, in slow and
soundless beat,
The minutes creep like frighted mice on dusty-
padded feet,
When sleep has passed the house to pace across the
distant sands,
Nor strove to shed one tiny grain of Peace from out
his hands,
And all the walls are watching eyes, and all the
dead things stir
With murmur-menace in their fret, of Fear the
harbinger,
Their lightest touch, their dimmest gleam, though
past, is still my prize—
Ah, kindlier than the purring Dark, and stronger
than the Wise,
And sweeter than the draught of dreams, past swords
of shade shall rise
The poppy of my stolen Hours to kiss the wearied
eyes.
VICTORIA.
ANTON DENNING.
The Inward Radiance.
Sometimes there is a light upon her face,
And in the still, grey depths of her wide eyes,
As though the eager soul, a little space,
Had stamped the flesh with its own fair device;
Or, too long lost in lovely things and wise,
Drawn to itself a high and secret grace,
That 'lends to petty things and commonplace
The solemn beauty of a sacrifice.
So, when the Summer moon, serenely white,
Moving, full-orbed, across the quiet night,
Paints the dull clouds, heavy with unshed rain,
With many-circled splendors, not their own,
This slavish loveliness, beheld again,
Seems yet more lovely that it forms her throne.

This One Caps Them All!
“ I have owned one of the ‘ Bunyip ’ Forest Devils
since 1909, and have used it in all classes of green stumps
and trees, large and small, and it has given every satis-
faction. I pulled two large trees in the township of
Marong, and plenty of the watchers stated that the
machine would not shift them. They were both pulled in
a very short time and with little trouble. I have pulled
large trees, one being x6ft. Bin. round the girth. The
machine, while in my use, never cost me one penny, and
is still in perfect order. I have used lots of other
machines, but this one caps them all.”

The Need of Export Duties.
On this Subject, “F.S.” writes
At the present time there exists an urgent demand
for at least two export duties —one on hides and
skins, the Other On wheat. The duties have been
needed for Some year®, but never as badly as now.
At first bluSh, export duties appear to be awkward
restraints upon trade, arid they Panriot be said to
be popular. Indeed* Senator Bar Ice if,, si few months
ago, sued the Argus for libel* beeauSe that journal
said that he favored an export duty OP wheat.- Ex-
port duties on raw material are* however* riot s
new thing; only recently Norway* for instance, im-
posed sti export duty upon log-timber* in the inter-
ests of the saw-milling industry. Of the two Aus-
tralian industries mentioned, one, that of tanning,
requites immediate assistance, dr it will soon become
extinct. A few years ago tanneries were numerous
all over the country. Tanning waS> a particularly
flourishing trade in Victoria 1 , and existed in all the
larger country centres, such as Warrnambool and
Geelong. Twenty years ago the Barwon, at Geelong,
was a hive of industry, with its tanneries and fell-
inongeries; and the same was the case with the
Merri at Warrnambool. To-day, nearly all of these
tanneries are out of existence. The trade itself, in
spite of the large increase in Australia’s flocks and
herds, is almo’st, stationary, At the same time,
the export of hides and Sheepskins has advanced
enormously:—
1905. 4§07.- 1909.
Sheepskins exported 5,353,789 7,32(8,(104 §,380,785
Hides exported . . 166,189 217,304 423,348
Had these skins and hides been treated here'; there
would have been remunerative employment for thou-
sands of men, both skilled and unskilled, while the
added value would have been a national asset. In
the same way, instead of, the milling industry beim
one of the most flourishing here —as it is, for ex-
ample, in the United States —it is almost standing
still. The flour milled in New South Wales was
210,137 tons in 1904, and in 1909 it was 214,426.
Victoria does not show up much better, its output
haying increased from 202,314 to 215,547 tons in the
same period. In the case of flour, the export of the
raw wheat is a bad thing for the country, quite
apart from the waste of opportunities for employing
labor. One of the deficiencies of our wheat lands
is lack of phosphates. This is exported by the ship-
load in the shape of the wheat skin, and the farmer
has to buy expensive manures to replace it. Also, pol-
latd and bran are badly needed by farmers for feed-
ing stock; but, owing to the comparatively small
amount of milling done, they are always at a higher
price than is necessary, while thousands of tons of
nollard and bran that could be profitably used here
are sent abroad. At the present time farmers have
to, pay £5 per ton and upwards for these articles.
Yet, whenever a suggestion is made to put an export
duty on either wheat or hides, the first men to rend
the Heavens with his cries is the agriculturist.
There is, however, no reasonable doubt that, were all
or most of our wheat to be milled here, and all of our
hides and skins tanned here, the three classes that
would scoop the pool would be the millers, tanners
and farmers.
Where the Tiger Should Spring Shortly.
One effect of the great strike in England
will be to hasten the nationalisation of
British railways. The Cold Country has
gone in for a good deal of Socialism lately,
and it is beginning to show a distinct liking
for the alleged Curse; In any case, a three
or four hours’ journey in winter, in a third-
or even a second-class carriage on some of
Britain’s private enterprise railway systems,
is enough, these days, to transform a Bruce
Smith into a convinced Communist. The
notorious South-Eastern and Chatham Rail-
way, for example, is one of the most dreadful
institutions of its sort on earth. Most of
the coaches date back to the Stone Age of
railway construction; they are not warmed ;
the first-class passenger, if he arrives in time
and secures a willing porter, gets a tin of
hot water wherewith to thaw his feet; the
patrons of the other classes, for the most
part, just freeze. The charges are extor-
tionate, and the tip-chaser is everywhere;
lot the employee’s wages are rotten. There
is a branch line in Scotland, connecting In-
verness with the Kyle of Lochalsh, which
for primitive discomfort, gradualness, un-
punctuality, dirt and all-round infamy would
make the local carper at our State railways
reel with amazement. As to the majority of
the Irish lines, they are the dead limit and
finish of everything. The trouble with most
of these railways is that, having been the first
that were ever constructed, they embody
every possible mistake. The Britisher, ow-
ing' to his conservative and patient tempera-
ment, has submitted for generations, while
the transport companies of his native land
deliberately perpetuated scores of old-time
errors for purposes of profit. One result is
that when the State takes over the railways
it will require practically to pull them to
pieces and put them together again, as has
been done on a gigantic scale with the Amer-
ican lines. The wretched time-keeping that
is a feature of many of the best-run lines, is
mainly due to gluts in the goods traffic, and
before this can begin to be remedied, tun-
nels, stations, yards, shops, etc., will have to
be entirely re-made. Of course, the price de-
manded for their property by the different
companies, will be stupendous. But between
that and - the sum they are likely to get
there should be a sizeable gap. Their paid-
up capital at the end of 1905 was estimated
at £1,282,801,000 sterling—a sum which in-
cluded capital raised for the purpose of sub-
scribing to other undertakings, as well as
nominal increases from time to time by the
playful process of stock “watering.” To-day,
however, the cos. are, generally speaking, in a
bad way, and the shares in most of them
have slumped severely. A study of the divi-
dends and the price of stock should enable
the Government to make a bargain not alto-
gether ruinous to the public. But in any
event, it is certain that before the United
Kingdom can know the boon of cheap and
comfortable railway travelling, it will re-
quire to pay through the nose —as every
country always has to do when the State
allows the Individual to get a really firm
grip on a necessary of life.
In dealing with his budget, Victorian State
Treasurer Watt proudly pointed out that
the interest bill on the Victorian national
debt amounted to £2,001,956, and the net
receipts from the loan-built public works
last year totalled £2,049,778. “I use these
figures,” exclaimed Watt, “to assure our
own people and those interested in us
abroad that in the full sense of the word
there is no Victorian public debt.” Yet, if
W. Watt borrowed £1 from Uncle Mel-
chisedek to buy six hens, and if the six
hens laid two dozen eggs one week, and if the
two dozen eggs paid the interest on the £l,
Watt would have the dead pig of scorn
thrown at him if he called round and tried
to persuade Melch. that he really didn’t
owe any £1 at all. And if W. Watt went
into details, Melch. would reply coldly (1)
that the debt was a debt whether the fowls
laid two dozen eggs or 200 dozen; (2) that
there was a cold winter time coming when
the fowls wouldn’t lay two eggs; and (3)
that there was a still colder time coming
when the fowls would be too dead to lay
even one egg.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tiie Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves ) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead} of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE CASE OF TRIPOLI (OR
AUSTRALIA).
Last week a swindle fell suddenly out of
the cloudless heavens, and struck Tripoli (or
Australia) in the eye. This may seem a
mixed metaphor, but the defendant has as-
suredly been struck in the eye, and the thing
that struck him was not noble enough to be
dignified by the name of a thunderbolt.
Tripoli is the last remnant of the once-great
Turkish Empire in Africa, for though the
British occupants of Egypt still profess to
regard Pharaoh’s old country as part of
the Ottoman Empire, no Turkish soldier or
officer is allowed to set foot there. Be-
cause of the British occupation of Egypt it
is impossible for a Turkish army to march
to the relief of Tripoli without Britain’s
permission. That permission is not likely to
be given, and, even if it was given, Egypt
is mostly desert, and there is small chance
of any appreciable part of an Ottoman army
getting across the sands alive. So, in a
time of profound peace, Italy served the
Unspeakable Turk with notice to hand over
Tripoli within 24 hours or thereabouts. The
Italian fleet is very large, and the Turkish
fleet is small and rotten, and Italy reckons
with confidence on bffing able to prevent the
Ottoman send : “u aid to his isolated posses-
sion by sea. It also reckons, doubtless with
perfect accuracy, that Britain won’t allow
him to send his army tramping there by
land, partly because Britain doesn’t want to
quarrel with Italy, which might also mean
taking on a quarrel with Austria and Ger-
many, Italy’s partners in the Triple Alli-
ance ; _ partly because the presence of the
Turk in Egypt might lead to local disorders;
and partly because Britain is rather tired
of the hopeless Ottoman. The Turk, despite
all his drawbacks, is a great and reckless
lighter, and he would gladly sink his teeth
in Italy’s leg by a rear attack on land ; in
other words, he would be pleased to start his
armies on the road to Rome, and argue with
tne Dago in his own country. But he can’t
reach Rome by land, because the Austrian
armies are in the way, and lie isn’t likely to
get there by sea, because the Italian fleet,
which is much larger than his own, is also
in the way. So his position is complicated.
The Italians hope that he is reduced to the
situation of a mere looker-on, after the man-
ner of the whale in its war with the ele-
phant.
* * * *
This sudden irruption of the Japanese into
Australia—that is to say, this sudden irrup-
tion of the Italians into Tripoli, but the cir-
cumstances are so similar that the mistake is
pardonable—is only what might be expected.
Australia —or rather Tripoli—is isolated
from the Mother Country. It has no efficient
army and navy of its own. Turkey
was once the mistress of the seas, but
its marine power was broken at Lepanto,
and has been struck by many disasters since
then, just as Britain’s naval power will be
struck and broken one day, because there is
an end of everything, and the glory can’t
last. for ever. So the Japanese rushed Aus-
tralia, taking advantage of Britain’s com-
plications with Germany—or, rather, the
Dagoes rushed Tripoli, taking advantage of
Turkey’s complications with Britain in
Egypt, which are really the same thing. The
two countries were at peace, just as the
British Empire is at peace with Japan, and
just Japan was at peace with Korea when
it annexed that miserable Land of the Morn-
ing Calm. In fact, Italy and Turkey were
almost in alliance, just as Britain is in alli-
ance with Japan, for arrangements were on
foot whereby the Ottoman Empire was to join
the Triple League of Germany, Austria and
Italy. But all this peace and friendship
made no difference in the case of Tripoli
when Italy wanted that country. And the
only thing the harassed suzerain managed
to do before war actually broke out was to
rush a shipload of military stores to Fre-
mantle—on second thoughts, that wasn’t the
name of the port where the stores were
landed, but the difference is infinitesimal —-
and then lie left Australia —that is to say,
Tripoli—to plough its lonely furrow for the
time being.
* # # *
There are two fatal things which a weak
State or dependency—especially one that oc-
cupies a desirable site —can do to the sub-
jects of a strong State which wants to annex
a desirable site. One is to shut out the sub-
jects of the strong State, and the other is to
let them in. China and Korea and Tibet
and Japan and Paraguay shut out foreigners,
just as Australia shuts out colored aliens.
The foreigners decided, when they found a
suitable opportunity, that this conduct
amounted to insult, and, by hard fighting
and murderous gunnery, they fought their
way in. China and Korea let foreigners in
under pressure, and Morocco and Tripoli and
the Transvaal let them in without pressure.
The result was that the foreigners estab-
lished “local interests” which presently had
to be protected, by a Japanese army in Korea,
and a French army in Morocco, and a British
annexation of the Transvaal, and an Italian
steal of Tripoli. But while (he French are
in Morocco because there are large French
interests there, the Germans hang around
the same place on the ground that it is a
grievous wrong and insult to Germany to
have no interests there. One nation is pro-
tecting the property it has, and the other is
protecting the property it hasn’t, but may
happen to have later on. In the same way.
Russia had to invade Manchuria to guard
the goods and effects which it stole from the
Chinese in the course of the invasion, and
Japan had to drive the Russians out be-
cause it was essential to its safety and dig-
nity to secure the Chinese assets which it
embezzled from the Russians while driving
the Russians out pf the bit of Chinese terri-
tory which China, on present appearances,
has no earthly hope of recovering. When
the account is added up. the sum of it
amounts to this: If a State is strone. either
in itself, or because, like Switzerland and
Holland, it occupies a position whDh makes
it worth the While of strong States to
stand by it, everything it does is fairly right.
And if it is weak, and stands alone, every-
thing it does is wrong—or is liable to
become wrong, just as soon as some stronger
Power has time to explain how wrong it is.
Some of the countries which came to grief
through shutting out foreigners deserved
their fate, and some did not. Some of the
countries which came to grief through ad-
mitting foreigners deserved their fate, and
some did not. In every case, the nation with
the big gun decided whether the fate was
deserved or not, and the nation with the old,
rusty, inefficient musket was shot without
trial. When the Japanese (or Italians)
came down with hardly any notice on Aus-
tralia (or Tripoli) the other day (or next
week), they had three simple and obvious
reasons or justifications: (1) The attacking
country was overcrowded, and required room
to expand (Italy has 307, and Japan 320,
people to the square mile) ; (2) the country
attacked was a “neglected” place, and was
not put to proper use (Tripoli is vaguely
estimated as having two or three people to
the square mile, and Australia has rather
less than two) ; (3) the attacking nation
had “interests” in the land of the attacked,
such as the Italian shops and warehouses in
Tripoli, and the Japanese pearling boats in
Queensland, and these interests required to
be protected. The big nation decided about
the size of the “interests,” and the amount
of protection which they required, and the
quantity of “neglect” in the enemy’s territory,
and the need for repairing that neglect—in
fact, it decided everything; and the small
community had so little say in the matter
that it might as well have been dead.
Whether a country is Athens at the pinnacle
of its glory, or Timbuctoo, scratching itself
at noon on top of its dust-heap with a
hyena looking «n —whether it is Australia,
or Tibet, or Morocco—it is liable to have
sentence passed upon it that it is one of the
world’s failures, and requires to be annexed.
And, unless it can shoot straight enough in
the Appeal Court, the sentence holds good.
Tripoli deserves the worst that is likely to
happen to it, because it is one of the most
lost and insanitary opportunities of history.
But Italy, which has made more money out
of the wretched African state than all the
rest of the world put together, and which
has found its commercial opportunity in
the Tripolitan’s incapacity, is the last
country which has a right to complain of its
incompetent neighbor.
* A’ * *
According to the theories of a certain fool-
ish crowd of cranks, now much in evidence,
the age of war is passing out and the age of
peace and arbitration is coming in. This is
a beautiful idea, but it doesn’t square with
facts. When a dispute arises between two
Towers, over some matter of small import-
ance, such as a few pounds of indemnity for
the Alabama piracies, or a few miles of
mountain territory on the border of Chili
and Argentina, arbitration is a success.
Neither party wants to tight. Neither wants
to be disgraced by yielding to the other, yet
each is willing to yield to a disinterested
arbitrator or third party. In short, each is
willing to make a dignified retreat, but wants
to “save his face.” But Britain won’t allow
the Hague tribunal to arbitrate on Ireland’s
claim to Home Rule, or on the Egyptian
National Party’s request that tne John
Bull army shall leave EgyDt, or on the de-
mand of a large section of the Indian people
for an Indian Parliament with real powers
of self-government. Russia won’t arbitrate
about Poland. Turkey won’t arbitrate
about the proposal tnat it should hand over
its last remaining dependency to a sudden
Italian buccaneer, because it knows per-
fectly well that Italy wouldn’t arbitrate in
such a cause unless it had previously squared
the court. Nor will either Turkey nor
Italy arbitrate if Tripoli demands independ-
ence. And if Australia ever arbitrates
over the one question which is likely to bring
about real trouble in these parts, the right
to keep this continent for the white race, it
deserves to lose its case. It would be as
reasonable for a sincere Christian to ask the
Hague tribunal to decide as to whether he
should or should not turn Atheist and blas-
pheme against the name of God. Just now
this country is afflicted with an eminent
Quaker visitor, who has been allowed .much
more space in the daily papers than his
mental outfit calls for, and this persota has
been denouncing the policy of compulsory
military education, and preaching arbitration
as a solid and reliable remedy for all dis-
putes. Yet, he plainly doesn’t believe in his
own theories, for the Australian Parliament,
which represents t,he opinion of the majority
of the Australian people, and is therefore the
supreme Arbitration Court of this country,
has decided that compulsory military train-
ing is necessary, and the Quaker urges the
community to revolt against the decision of
the Court because he doesn’t happen to ap-
prove of it. When even Quakers won’t
abide by the verdict of an Arbitration Court
unless it is the verdict they want it is no
wonder that Italy is getting out its Dread-
nought, and Tripoli is polishing up its old
musket, and that they both propose to fight
like the devil.
* * * *
As for the result, supposing the matter is
argued to a finish, that rests with the gods.
Italy has a fleet against which, on paper,
the Unspeakable Turk hasn’t a hope on the
face of the great waters. But the Italian
navy has never yet wiped out the utter
shame and disgrace of the battle of Lissa
fought in 1866 —the last sea fight f of any im-
portance in European seas. Then Italy ran
against Austria, and it was a case of a big
fleet against a much smaller one; a fleet
that was mostly iron against one that was
mostly wood; the largest and most solid
ironclads of the period against vessels
with a thin plating of metal; guns
that threw a 3001 b. shot against guns that
threw 401 b.; and a nation with old naval
traditions against one which had hardly
shown its flag on the seas. But, as a his-
torian of the period put it, “there were two
men in command; Tegetthof was a man
and a half, and Persano was half a man.”
And until Italy does something to obliterate
that tale of misery it isn’t certain that it
will find even the dilapidated Turkish
squadron a fleet of beer and skittles. As for
the Italian army, it is a very great army,
and it wears a beautiful uniform, and it
made its last public appearance when it was
disgracefully and horribly licked by the
Abyssinians. In spite of the visible odds
there is no assurance about the result. But
it is certain that the time when arbitration
will take the place of war hasn’t come yet;
that a feeble State or dependency can’t rely
on its inoffensiveness as a guarantee of
peace; that the Jap or Italian is liable to
turn up outside the gate of Australia or
Tripoli at very short notice; and that when
a country with no army and ravy of its own
appeals to the conscience of the civilised
world in its time of trouble it gets a very
poor response. The civilised world simply
looks over the top of its locked gate and
asks: “Supposing I help you now, what help
can you give me in return when I want it?”
The applicant replies that he can give none
worth mentioning, whereupon the civilised
world says briefly: “Go to perdition.” And,
sad to say, the applicant generally goes
there. That is one of the reasons why per-
dition is overcrowded.
STOUT LYING AND THIN LAW.
During the Referenda campaign the State
Rights or anti-Labor organs made a strong
point of the alleged fact that the talk about
injurious monopolies in Australia was all
flam and moonshine. In this connection the
Sydney Telegraph held forth as follows: —
“Are the people to rule themselves?” That is the
fundamental issue. Let us see that it is not ob- '
scored by handfuls of dust about Trusts and mono-
polies that do not exist, and that show no signs of
existing.
Melbourne Age stated the proyincialist case,
a few days later, this way:—
The chief point at issue, says Mr. Hughes, ‘is the
overthrow of the power of the Trusts, “Which rule
here as they do in America.” This has been the cry
of the Labor party all through the Referenda cam-
paign. It is a hollow sham. We have no Trusts as
in America.
This audacious fiction concerning Australia’s
freedom from anything harmfulin the mon-
onoly line was persist°d ; n by the Tory m-ess
till the wage-earners had been bull-dozed in-
to voting the? Adipose ticket. Then, there
being no immediate need for further lying,
these same papers, which had claimed that
the local monopoly or>”«e was a mvopic and
hollow sham, began to fill their news-columns
with stories about monopolies old and new.
and to clamor in their leaders for relief
auainst the same. Within six weeks of the
Referenda poll the Sydney and Melbourne
games had mentioned variously the exist-
ence of a Shipping Trust, a Brick Trust, a
hruit lryst, a Tobacco Trust, a Butter-box
1 rust, a Timber Trust, a Fish Trust and a
lueat Irust, each of which was represented
as doing its level best to depreciate the
spending power of the producer’s sovereign
And, finally, Melbourne Age, which, doubt-
less, earned thousands of votes for the cause
of anti-Australianism, last April, by its
cheerful yarn, that the country “has no
Trusts as in America,” awoke to the exist-
ence of the Sugar Trust. Said the Age, on
August 9 last: —
We need for our own consumption in Australia
about 220,000 tons of sugar. We have not, as yet,
overtaken that amount of production, because of the
monopoly which bestrides the growers like a Colossus,
cramping and crippling their operations. We im-
ported in 1909 about 99,000 tons of sugar, of the
value of £1,000,000 sterling. All that should have
been grown by ourselves, and will be as soon as the
industry can get released from the shackles under
which it struggles.
Also, the Age deplored the circumstance
that “at present the enormous profits of the
sugar trade are pouring into the exchequer
of a giant monopoly” ; and, casting its anti-
Socialist convictions into the office dust-bin,
it called, like any unthinking Labor person,
for nationalisation. And, in conclusion, it
had the imperial nerve to claim that the fact
that the “voracious maw” of the Sugar Trust
hadn’t been “already tapped by a State Re-
finery fitted to smash private monopoly” was
“a blow delivered by Labor at public recti-
tude,” an object-lesson in the insincerity of
Labor professions, “and a slur that will
always stand” against the present Australian
Government.
To the mild suggestion that one of the
things which prevented the Australian Gov-
ernment from going into the su'gar business
was that same Federal Constitution which
the Age had fought so strenuously to keep
unamended, the infuriated paper directed the
eye of scorn and the snort of contempt. It
appeared that the Age had gone into the con-
stitutional aspect of this question with “a
lawyer,” and hence knew all about it. Strong
in the faith that was in it, the misguided
journal proceeded to lay down the following
propositions: (1) Section 51 of the Constitu-
tion says, “The Parliament shall, subject to
this Constitution, have power to make laws
for the peace, order and good government of
the Commonwealth”: (2) the C.S.R. Trust
is, by its shameless fleecing of the Australian
tea-drinker, jam, pickle, cake and sweet-
eater (in short, by its daylight robbery of
all sections of the community), subverting
the peace, order, etc., of the nation; where-
fore (3) the Australian Parliament has full
power under Section 51 to step in and wipe
the offending Trust off the face pf the Com-
monwealth. The ’-■oint was taken in several
quarters that the essence of a Federal Con-
stitution is its limiting of Parliament to cer-
tain legislative powers, the unmentioned resi-
due being in the hands of the States. The
Age sprang on that by no means novel view
with the weight of a falling cathedral. It
announced (11/9/T1) that “while Section
51 of the Constitution does not specifidalhj
authorise the Federal Government to become
sugar refiners, it doesn’t forbid it.”
Where “peace and order” require it, said the
Age gravely, sententiously, “Nationalisation
becomes part of the Federal power.” When
the deafening howl of legal laughter which
greeted this opinion, had died down, the Age
sacked or otherwise disposed of its original
“lawyer,” and sought advice elsewhere, in
the desperate hope of saving its face. The
best that the new expert could do was to
recommend the hoodwinked sheet to repre-
sent that all it meant when it said that
sugar-refining had become “part of the Fed-
eral Dower,” because it wasn’t “expressly
forbidden” in the Constitution, was that a
Federal sugar refinery was constitutionally
permissible in Federal territory. It was a
lamentably unconvincing bit of sidersteppery,
in all the circumstances, but it was better
than acknowledged defeat. With extreme
vigor, and the most blatant effrontery, the
Age started explaining that this was what
it had meant all along, and that the Fisher
Government, by not immediately going into
the sugar-refining business on Federal terri-
tory, was proving “recreant to its trust,”
“insincere,” “scornful- of rectitude.”- and all
the rest. The shout of legal laughter that
had greeted the Age’s first effort was a mere
snigger by comparison with the lusty yell of
amusement which proceeded from the busi-
ness world at the idea of any Government on
earth wiping out the vast C.S.R. concern by
the institution of a Government Refinery,
which will be compelled to work at (say)
Yassberra. That the Australian Parliament
has power to go into what business it pleases
on its own territory, is known to most school-
children. But a scheme for scotching Aus-
tralia’s “Sugar Colossus,” on such lines, is
about as rational and practicable as that of
a mammoth block of residential flats in Rar-
ringun, or a £500,000 theatre on King
Island, or an ice factory in Sheol. The Agf,
bowed dejectedly before the second blast of
ridicule it had evoked, and, for a while, it
was silent.
Then, on September 22, it executed its ulti-
mate bandspring or contortion, in connection
with this matter, as follows: —
If the Government had taken good advice and
limited its Referendum to one or two plain ques-
tions —especially the power to deal with monopolies
—it could have had what it desired. It very un-
wisely grasped at too much, and got nothing. That
must be patent to everybody now, including the
members of the very party which made the blunder.
What the people have to realise is that it is in con-
sequence of these tactical blunders on the part of
the Labor Government they are now suffering as
they are at the hands of this giant sugar monopoly,
and paying something over £1,000,000 a year for
the maintenance of the industry.
No more cocksure talk about the inner sig-
nification of Section 51; no more blither
about Federal sugar mills on the Cotter, or
Gommonwealth fish-canneries in th,e Lever
Never Plains. The entire shouting and
tumult dies in a wail that was discredited
before the Referenda campaigners had been
in action a month.
As this paper remarked, as far back as
last February, and many times afterwards,
tbe Referenda questions submitted by the
Australian Government were the irreducible
minimum requisite to ensure the New Pro-
tection, Federal control of monopolies and
the Federal Common Rule principle, or aw
one of them , against nullification bv the High
Court. From the moment the Government s
proposals were made public, anti-Labontes

would vote for it” —to the rage of “Liberal
manufacturers, who were, however, perfectly
willing to vote “Yes” to the monopoly-
scotching clause, provided it stood alone.
And so on right through the piece. The
reason why the Government was unable to
limit things to “one or two plain questions—
especially the power to deal with monop-
olies,” may be understood by a reference to
the High Court’s decision in the matter of
the Excise Act, and in half a dozen other
test cases. The powers asked for in con-
nection with trade, commerce and corpora-
tions. the New Protection and the Common
Rule were interdependent. If the Austra-
lian Parliament is denied one. it must forpro
all. The plain problem, therefore, that this
country has to face, in the near future, is
whether it is wiser to continue being fleeced
bv sugar, shipping, meat, and a dozen othpr
Trusts, which even the most rabidly Liberal
sheets now admit are in existence, or
whether it is worth taking the risk of such
horrors as may accrue from letting Austra-
lian legislators in the Australian Parliament
handle certain matters that are now under
the control of Australian legislators in the
State Assemblies. It is one of those Facts
of Life which can no more be avoided than
Grief or Death.

The Private Railway Advocate.
Tiiat steady and reliable anti-Australian
paper, the Sydney Telegraph, appears to
be always hankering inwardly for nigger
labor and private railway ownership. Many
vears ago it was found beaming on a scheme
for the sale of the Sydney tramways to a
syndicate, and it has beamed in the same
spirit ever since. Last week the object of
its admiration was the Canadian Pacific
Kailway, on which subject it discharged the
heavy cargo of its soul as follows: —
The Canadian Pacific —the greatest railway in
Canada —has fared remarkably well in the past
financial y ear. The N.S.W. Government railways in
the year ended June 30, earned a gross £6,042,205,
hut in the same period the Canadian Pacific traffic
reached £21,250,272, or 3i times as much . . .
The net earnings were £9,061,680, as compared
with £2,351,144 on the N.S.W. lines, or nearly
fourfold. ... We make a great deal of our lines
earning a net £4 13s. 6d. per cent, on capital, but
the Canadian-Pacific earned over 17 per cent, on its
ordinary stock. . . . The railway companies of
Canada have done a long way more for that
COUNTRY THAN OUR GOVERNMENT RAILWAYS HAVE
DONE FOR US.
The Telegraph is a strong supporter of
N.S.W. when, by supporting that State, it
can get a chance to throw clods at Aus-
tralia in general, but it is quite ready to
aim slops at N.S.W. when it can thereby
exalt some foreign country. The order or
its preference seems to be: (1) Britain; (2)
any foreign country that believes strongly
in Private Enterprise; (3) Sydney! (4) the
rest of New South Wales; (5) Queensland,
Tasmania, S.A. and Westralia; (o) Vic-
toria, which occupies a low place because
for 40 years it kept ahead of New South
Wales in wealth and population; (7) Hell;
(8) the Commonwealth. So its loud ap-
plause re the privately-owned Canadian
Pacific Railway as compared with the State
railways of N.S.W. is quite natural. But,
in the first place, it must be remembered
that the Canadian Pacific Co. spreads right
across Canada —a Dominion of 3,72y,bb0
square miles, to say nothing of its leased
hues in the United States; while the N.te.VV.
V'tate railways have only 310,372 square miles
lo exploit. in other words, Canada is J 2
times the size of N.S.W., and the C. I. Rail-
way has the run of seven States. Then the
Canadian Pacific *Co. owns 10,270 miles of
line in Canada, and owns or controls 15,200
wiles of line in Canada and the United
States. In other words, the great Canuck
octopus bosses fully four times as much rail-
way as the N.S.W. Government, and the
Telegraph makes a stupendous song about
the fact that, out of four times as much
railway, it makes times _as much
pgYo]2xio. But the Canadian Pacific, doesn t
even make this honestly and by its own
efforts. It started with 700 miles of railway
built by the Government and given to it as
a present under very shady circumstances;
also, it got as a free gift from the nation
over £5,000,000 in cash (sufficient to build
about 500 miles more line) and 20,000,0UU
acres of good, carefully-selected land —an
area about li times the size of Tasmania,
not much smaller than England, and nearly
equal to the cultivated area of the Common-
wealth times over. The position would
be much the same if the Commonwealth
owned the Australian railway system, and
if when it was getting to work on the first
big line —the one from Longreach in Central
Queensland round; by all the big cities to
Oodnadatta in S.A. —it found that some
kindly person had built and handed over, m
"ood working order, the section from New-
castle to Sydney, Melbourne and Ballarat,
also hhd given it enough cash to finish the
line to Adelaide, and had made it a present
of half of Victoria, ah course it was impos-
sible to do such a huge fraud on the public
as the C. P. Railway affair without the
names of many of Canada’s corrupt politi-
cians stinking like the breath of the Devil;
but it was a great time for the C. P. Railway
Co. That bloodsucking concern can pay its
dividends out of the proceeds of the money
and land it received from the wretched
Government and the earnings of the 700
miles of railway the Government built for
it ; if these gifts and bonuses were deducted
and it had to pay its own way like the Aus-
tralian State lines it would, on the evidence,
show just about no profit at all. (Even
now it only pays 4 per cent, on its prefer-
ence stock.) in addition to everything else,
it may be mentioned that the C. P. Railway
Co. is a great steamship owner, and its luck
in getting Government subsidies for its ships
has been quite remarkable. And then it
bled the towns along the line of its railway
for huge subsidies; if there were alternative
routes the line wept where the most loot
lav. There is really no Private Enter-
prise in Canadian railways—only Cadging or
Subsidised Enterprise. No one has ever
found out how much of the subsidies went
back in the shape of bribes to certain of the
politicians who voted for making a wholesale
present of the nation’s assets to private rail-
way speculators, but there has been a heap
of suspicions. The lands have been given
away so gaily to alleged Private Enterprise
that, though Canada is larger than the Aus-
tralian Commonwealth, its central Govern-
ment has only one-sixth of Australia’s land
revenue. In fact, the C. P. Railway has
more land revenue than the Dominion Trea-
sury possesses.
A Belltopper in the Garden of Eden.
A quaint, recent addition to decentralisation
literature was a letter, which appeared over
the signature of %“Owen Blackett,” in a
Sydney daily. Sasd Owen B.: —
For many vears it has been fully recognised that
the State of N.S.W. suffered from having the larger
proportion of the population in one centre, namely,
Svdnev. Various suggestions have been made, and a
commission has been appointed to consider the ques-
tion of opening up ports on the coast. Jervis Bay,
Twofold Bav, Port Stephens and other places have
been considered, and plans made for railway lines
to connect these places with the back country all
very good in its way, but would NEVER really ac-
complish what is desired. The small coasting
STEAMER WOULD STILL BRING THE GOODS TO SYDNEY
FOR TRANSHIPMENT.
There is a story told of a French artist, who
painted Adam with a belltopper in the
Garden of Eden, simply because he was a
stereotyped artist, who couldn’t realise that
the institutions of his own day were not
GoD-given affairs which always had been and
always would be. Mr. Owen Blackett and
his fellows of the N.S.W. Congestion party,
recall that individual, after a small, casual
fashion. In their view, though railways
were made to, and wharves were built at,
the good but neglected ports ot JN.fe.VV ,
and though these ports were as sate and
commodious as Sydney, and though they
supplied a convenient outlet for the produce
of districts as large and fertile as the one
which has its natural outlet at Sydney, still
big ships wouldn’t go in there. The deepwater,
and the safe harborage, and the business, and
the money to be made—none of these would
tempt them, simply because these places
wouldn’t be Sydney. Sydney isn’t a very
old institution, and the big ships didn t
come there in Abraham’s time, but, all the
same, Sydney, it seems, is a sort of Divine
dispensation, and no large vessels could go
anywhere else on the N.S.W. coast. Cer-
tainly, strange upheavals have happened
before. The rise of Melbourne and Bris-
bane, at a time when these places were both
in N.S.W. territory, hinted that trade was
possible at other places than Port Jackson,
and that centralisation was not actually laid
down in the decalogue, and that great ocean
liners could call at new places without being
struck by lightning; but, by some unex-
plained dispensation of Providence, nothing
of the kind, so we now learn, can possibly
happen again. The book of the old disoensa-
tion is closed. In Britain, things are done
on different lines. Old as that _ place is, it
hasn’t petrified yet, so far as. its shipping
business is concerned. When it appears as
if a new port was wanted on some part of
the British coast, any . convenient inlet is
turned into a port, and supplied with
wharves and a railway, and promptly the big
ships come. For instance, not so very long
ago, some casual folk, or freaks, made docks
at Cardiff, and it is now the second port in
the British Isles. Blyth, Manchester and
Methil were added to the list of great British
ports within the last few days, so tq speak.
But, for some hidden reason —possibly the
presence of prickly pear on the shore, or
it may be through drink or paraWs—we
are assured that N.S.W. is built on different
principles, and, even if good, new ports were
opened, the shipping trade would decline to
recognise them. No matter how many thou l
sand bales of wool were waiting on the
wharves, the fleets would hurry by. So, the
position being desperate, Owen Blackett
suggests establishing locomotive and railway
carriage and truck shops at Bathurst and
Goulburn, and dragging all crippled rolling-
stock there for repair, in order to make some-
thing of a population at these centres. It
seems rather an artificial expedient, but, if
there really is such an enduring curse on
Port Stephens and Twofold Bay. and all
the other places, that no amount of business
would bring ocean-going craft into them, it
is, perhaps, as good an idea as can be found.

The Man Whom Directors Do Not Know.
Probably one of the most fatuous issues
connected with present-day strikes is the
solemn and stupid persistence of the direc-
tors of companies in declining to recognise
the existence of unions. The big railway
strike in England was actually caused by
this ostrich-like behavior. A conciliation
board had been arranged for, but one of the
stipulations was that no union official must
have anything to do with it. Which some-
what resembles what would happen it every
kind of animal except a horse were allowed
to enter for the Melbourne Cup. Then, when
the strike took place, there was the same
foolish mummery. The directors sat in one
room, and the union officials in another;
and the Government representatives capered
to and fro and conferred with each in turn .
Now, the union has won recognition, and
next time the two parties will sit in the
same room. Yet, no sooner is the trouble
settled in England than it breaks out in
Tasmania. There a set of addle-headed
directors, who had learned nothing from the
English strike, wrote to J. R. Little,
general secretary of the Amalgamated Mine
Employees’ Association, a letter beginning:
The directors do not fully understand your con-
nection with the matter, but, assuming that you are
fully accredited by the strikers, etc.
The first statement, of course, was sheer pre-
tence. The directors and everyone else in-
terested know 'Well enough that Little is
the leading official, selected by thousands ot
men, of a powerful union. This curious
habit by which one person professes not to
know of the existence of’ another doesn t
weaken unionism. That institution exists
and will keep on existing whether it is
“recognised” by certain directors or not.
They might as well profess not to recognise
the earth or the Supreme Court or the
police—which foolish act, so far as concerns
the police, is a thing often done by the
criminal classes when the force comes round
the corner with less noise than usual, and
tne result is often three years’ hard labor.
The non-recognition idea, in short, is. sbeei
unproductive foolishness, except that it may
produce superfluous aggravation. And this
world has already got all the aggravation it
requires.

The Country of the Great IOU.
In making his Budget Speech, lousepii
Ward of Maoriland, mourned over the
wickedness of the people who have said that
“Our debt is a grievous burden, almost too
great to be borne.” It is stupid, says lon,
to look at the debts without looking at the
assets Well, look at the assets. Maori-
land’s total public debt less accumulated
sinking funds, amounts to ±<y,<s£W,obb, and,
on lou’s own showing, £25,452,758 is abso-
lutely non-interest bearing, while another
£13,000,000. or thereabouts, is only indi-
rectlv reproductive.” Included in this latter
amount is £6,871,251 spent on roads and
culverts, and £5,240,251 put into public
buildings. The roads and culverts don t pro-
duce one penny of revenue; and the best
that the baronet can say for the Public
buildings is that, if the Dominion hadnt
borrowed to pay for them, it would have
had to pay rent. Which suggests that lou
never heard of a man who became the owner
of either a coat or a house by the simple
process of saving up and buying it. Any-
how. here is Re admitted Jact Rat over
£38,000,000 of the public debt of Maoriland
isn’t producing revenue. Rut if it isn’t nr >-
ducing revenue, it at least produces two crops
of interest bills a year; and, as the things
don’t earn their own interest, nothing is
surer than that the interest has to be made
up out of taxation. The population of
Maoriland is now 1,008,000. That means
that, even excluding; the whole debt which
lou says isn’t a debt, because it is for the
present earning something, Maorilanders owe
about £37 10s. per head. Now, lou is quite
sorry for the poor nations whose debt isn’t
like Maoriland’s —-nations whose debt is
mostly, he says, non-productive. Yet, among
all the countries that lou is so sorry for,
there isn’t one which owes as much as
Maoriland’s £3B, and there are only about
three which owe even half as much. Portu-
gal is the horrible example of Europe—an
example of drift, and muddle and damn the
consequences—and even Portugal owes only
£25 Bs. 2d. per head, including everything.
So the dreadful fact remains that, even if
its interest-producing debt wasn’t a debt,
Maoriland would still owe moi'e than any
oountrv mentioned in the Statesman’s
Year Book, and twice as much as any, bar
three horrible examples; yet, while Ward
slops over with grief for the other countries,
he doesn’t sorrow at all for Maoriland, but,
instead, goes on piling up more unproduc-
tive debt that will have to be paid for by
more taxation. And while he does it, this
shocking spendthrift has the audacity to re-
fer to people who tell the plain facts as. “ig-
norant and ill-informed persons whose inex-
cusable misstatements have done serious in-
jury to our country.”

England Prays for Australia!
An amazing “word-picture” from London
M.A.P. The scene was a Quaker meeting: —
Then a young married lady rose. She struck
straight into her subject, and asked especially that
the boys before her might unite in bringing them-
selves into deep spiritual sympathy with certain
Quaker boys in Australia who were at that very
hour undergoing severe trials of faith, inasmuch as
they had made up their minds to resist the new law
for compulsory military training, which was to come
into effect on July 1. She urged on all present that
Christianity and true heroism were inseparably
linked together, and that new truth had always been
won through pain and suffering. She declared that
it was impossible for a follower of Christ to take
up the sword. She described how the pain of the
new law was cutting deeply into the hearts of boys
and their parents away in our fair colony of Aus-
tralia. She told of a letter she had received, describ-
ing how a number of lads had gathered straight
from their playing-field, to sit in solemn meeting
together to consider, apart from their elders, what
it was their duty to do. How they had unanimously
agreed to stand firm for resistance of the law, save
for one boy, who had already given in his name and
been measured lor his uniform. How at last this
boy broke forth in a passion of conviction after a
severe inward struggle: “I have settled it. I shall
give backward to-morrow.” She explained, that as
yet there had been no time to hear what had exactly
occurred, but that these boys were prepared to endure
detention in barracks, or any other pains. and penal-
ties that might fall upon them, and pernaps, worst
of all, the mockery of their fellows. She herself
was setting forth to visit friends in Australia, and
she pleaded that the hearts of the boys present
might go out in a mystical and spiritual union with
their fellows in Australia, that thus strength might
pass from them, sitting at ease in England, to those
who were for the moment in the forefront of the
ever-advancing campaign on behalf of peace on earth
and goodwill towards men.
It was one of Dickens’s characters who
pointed out forcible to his wife that, if she
persisted in praying for him against his will,
she would get her head punched. Are there
any Australians really sending pathetic ap-
peals to England for sympathy of this sort.
Or is it all hysterical lying of a spe-
cies already too familiar? Possibly, when
that con'wientious footballer finds an Asiatic
laving profane hands on his home and bis
mother —and the prevention of that possi-
bility is almost the sole reason for Austra-
lia’s present self-defence movement —he will
“give backward” once more, and curse the
silly old women who persuaded him that it
was “Christianity and true heroism” to get
away to his football, while other fellows
were learning how to hold a gum Mean-
while, it is interesting to observe that, a_t
Australia’s new professional Military Col-
lege at Duntruon, there is a flourishing
branch of the Students’ Christian Union-
showing that the two things can run all
right in double harness. The majority of
the 40-odd cadets belong to it, and, when any
forcible objection or interruption is raised
by a non-member, some militant Christian
takes him on; then an adjournment to the
gymnasium is made, and the matter is dis-
cussed with the help of referee, seconds and
towels. Up to date, it is not observable that
the Christians have got any the worse of
the arguments. This severe outward struggle
seems better Christianity—and is certainly
better citizenship—than the “severe inward
struggle” of the M.A.P. female’s (probably
imagine rv) Australian lad. But. if he
really exists, “detention in barracks” is not
the punishment for him. That should be
the inside of a gaol. This is no time for
trifling, and the fellow who insists on being
at football while the others are at drill must
be suppressed. If he wants to be a martyr,
let him do the thing properly.

The Jap: On the Word of His Own
Newspapers.
There is a class of untravelled Australian —
the Bruce Smiths, W. A. Holmans and
Wowser parsons of the Commonwealth —
who are for ever lauding the Jap as a para-
gon of every virtue. None of them have met
their idol on his native heath, and they
have, consequently, no real knowledge of his
character. People like Mr. Weigall, the en-
gineer son of the head master of Sydney
Grammar School, who return here with
disturbing tales of Japanese lawlessness, are
damned by all good Black Australians for
narrow-minded distorters, of the truth. And
as the pro-nigger folk live, politically and
otherwise, in most cases, by their, gift of
loud and ornate speech, the unthinking pub-
lic is left with a vague impression that the
Jan is a maligned angel. This tendency is
right into the hands of the Peace Society
people —the fools who argue that Australia
may safely neglect to arm, since the yellow
brother is too enlightened and law-abiding
to dream of invasion and loot and rapine—
and they push it along with vigor. It is
tiresome to hear people accused of qualities
which they do not possess, and it is unde-
sirable that ignorance should be fostered in
regard to the nation from which Australia
has most to fear. For these reasons, among
others, The Bulletin has taken a certain
dreary pleasure in compiling the following
list of cases reported in Japanese papers
for July last.
On the 11th, Mr. Tanaka Matsittaro, a police in-
spector and chief of the Tsuruga police, was
suddenly dismissed from office for “official corrup-
tion” and accepting bribes, and arrested on a warrant
issued by a Public Procurator in the Fukui Chiho
Saibansho. , XT r -
On the 12th, Judge Ikeda Seisei, of the Nagasaki
Appeal Court, was arrested on a warrant issued from
The Good-Intentions Road.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This Government is full of good intentions.
Weekly paper.
I saw a herd of nations tramping down the
Track of Years — . . A
Some were old and prehistoric and equipped
with played-out seers.
They were clothed in rags and tatters, anu
they marched in clouted shoon,
And the weight of broken idols bowed each
faded pantaloon! ,
All were dismal, drab, and hopeless, and
somehow it seemed to me
That I witnessed all the Peoples from tlie
dimmest days 8.C.! ,
And they answered, when I asked them
where it was the torrent flowed,
“We are making tracks for Sheol on the
Good-Intentions Road !”
I heard the voice of Moses quavering sadly
in the gloom;
“This is Judah’s ancient wreckage, and it
hustles towards the Tomb!
I, who led them out of Egypt, gave the
counsel long ago, . ,
Ere they saw the plains of Canaan or had
conquered Jericho!
But they hearkened unto prophets ot the
Moafetish kind.
So the Kingdom broke asunder and the
Tribes are hard to find ;
Here are Judah’s battered fragments, bend-
ing low beneath the load,
Making tracks for old Gehenna on the
Good-Intentions Road !”
I saw a form go slowly—it was brave Tiiem-
ISTOCLES, .
And his head was bowed and sunken with
unhanpy memories !
Then said he: “I am the Leader who pre-
vailed in days of yore,
When we sank the ships of Persia by the
fair M gean shore !
It was I who joined the peoples gainst the
nation’s common foe;
But the days of Greece are over and the
Alexanders go!
Now the Turk is feared m Athens, and the
seed Lycurgus sowed —
It is blowing towards Perdition on the
Good-Intentions Road !”
I heard the voice of Xerxes echo plainly in
the night; „ .
And he said: “I am the Persian who was
strong to rule and smite!
It was I who sundered Athos, and I flogged
the stubborn sea;
I saw the flames of Athens and 1 knew
Tbermonybe! » .
The solendor of Cambyses was mine in an-
cient days;
Now where is Persia’s glory—l hear no
hymns of praise!
Where ?«, the fame of Susa, and Ecbatana s
ode? —
We are travelling towards .Tchannum, on
the Good-Intentions Road !”
I saw the Suffete marching—he cried with
weary eyes: ' . .
“I am the Carthaginian—kings watched our
splendors rise !
We planned for strong dominion oer land
and stretching sea;
Our proud triremes went sailing far upon the
Western Sea.
I am the lone Capuan, the son of Hamil-
car; .
The Vandal ruled in Carthage—our glories
vanished are!
Vain is the dreamed dominion —a million
wrecks are strowed ;
And a million hones are buried by the Good-
Intentions Road !”
The herd of nations tramping passed on
athwart the years—
Passed on with hooeless Leaders and broken-
h°art»d seers !
The Greek and Babylonian, Egyptian, Per-
sian. Jew;
Grey Moses. Xerxes, C^sar—a strange
" and motley crew !
The e-lories of Cunaxa, Pharsalia’s crimson
dav — 1
Gone with Arbela’s splendor and Alexan-
drian sway!
A wrack of ghosts all heading unto their
last abode —
The dusty tomo that endeth the Good-In-

the Procurator s Office in the Nagasaki Chiho Sai-
bansho, for “official corruption” and accepting
bribes.
On the 13th, an action was begun in the Court of
Cassation, Tokyo, against two prominent business
men, and a millionaire viscount, in connection with a
vast mining swindle involving a matter of 20 million
yen.
On the 14th, Mr. Danjo Eitaro, managing direc-
tor of the Tomo Light Railway Company, of Tomo,
Hiroshima Prefecture, was arrested on a warrant
issued by the Procurator’s Office in the Onomichi
Court on the 3rd instant, on a charge of fraud.
On the 15th, Mr. Oiye Shichibei, a well-known
shipping and forwarding merchant of Osaka, who is
reputed to be worth several million yen, was ar-
rested on a charge of bribery.
On the 16th, a gang of forgers; numbering 50, was
arrested in Yokohama. They had a million yens
worth of counterfeit notes in their possession.
On the 17th, Mr. Tsukasaki Mitsutosiii, the mana-
ger, Mr. Taciiimoto Jirota, the sub-manager, and
others in the Osaka branch of the 147th bank, were
arrested and charged with having defrauded the in-
stitution of a large sum of money. On the same
date a prominent dry-goods merchant, named Matsui
Kiciiiyemon, aged 27, of Higashi-ku, Osaka, was
sentenced to four years’ penal servitude for forgery
and fraud.
Also, a retired military officer, Major Inazu Yosiii-
kata, aged 63, of Himeji, who had served in the
China-Jap and Russo-Jap wars, and earned the Order
of the Rising Sun, was arrested on a charge of forg-
ing official stamps and documents. The accused —a
wealthy man said to have a fortune of Y 20,00
is alleged to have forged railway passes by using
counterfeit seals of the lltli and 17th Infantry Regi-
ments, and to have travelled on the • railway with
the forged passes between Himeji and Tokyo and
other places.
On the 18th, Sub-Lieutenant Seki Kei, on the re-
serve list of the Japanese Navy, and living at
Shizuoka, was sentenced to six months’ imprison-
ment in the Shizuoka Ku Saibansho on a charge of
theft.
That the above record is nothing out of the
way, may be gathered by a reference to the
Asaiii, or any of the Jap newspapers. The
point that the insane Peace Society crank
and the equally insane anti-Defence crank
require to be made to realise is that it is on
the forbearing scruples of these hungry
people-rotten to the core, in an ethical man-
ner of speaking—that Australia’s whole
safety depends, unless Australia arms in its
own defence. On the evidence of their own
press the very governing classes of Japan
are not to be trusted in large matters or
small. In the circumstances the barrackers
for No Defence resemble one wuo advocates
an open and unguarded home when burglars
and wild animals are known to be in the
neighborhood.
Party Government with the Gloves (like-
wise the Coat, Shirt and Trousers) Off.
The Sydney dailies have been full of the
trouble in the N. S. Wales Assembly for
weeks now; and every place where men
gather for the purpose of argument, drink,
travel, blither or business still reeks of it.
Oaths fly, friendships burst, recriminations
are hurled, beer is spilled in connection with
the affair every day, yet it is doubtful if one
N. S. Wales citizen in 20 appreciates the
reason—the sole reason —why his Assembly
is being degraded, and his time and money
so shamelessly wasted. The average man
does his thinking according to certain set
formulae; and one of the accepted axioms
among right - thinkers, British Empire
Leaguers, Wimmen’s Leaguers and other
idiots, is that the Party Government system
is a Boon which none but Mad Disloyalists
and Experimental Legislators are willing to
forego. The whole cause of the uproar in
Parliament and of the press libels and the
assaults verbal and physical that have smit-
ten the Speaker; and the entire explanation
of the fact that the “Liberals” of Stuart
Town recently announced their intention of
hanging Willis “like a dog” if he came up
their way, is Party Government. If Party
considerations could only be eliminated from
this matter it would be admitted readily
that Willis, by accepting the N. S. Wales
Speakership, had done good service to his
State.. A general election on the existing
defective rolls, whereby about one-eighth of
the State would be disfranchised, would be
a plain farce. Anyhow, the law would call
for a fresh election a month or so later —as
soon, that is to say. as the constituencies
should have been redistributed. Willis has
therefore, at the worst, saved the N. S. Wales
taxpayer a matter of £IOO,OOO. As against
that, he has slightly prejudiced his party
leader’s slender prospect of presently grab-
bing office. Now it matters hardly at all to
N. S. Wales whether a “Liberal” or Labor
Government runs things. Politically, they
both stand on the same patch of earth, or
mud. As regards the basic principles of
hard borrowing and lavish expenditure, the
boosting-up of Sydney and the crying-down
of Australia, and so forth, they are as twin
souls. True, the State Labor party stands
slightly ahead of the WADE-ites in the mat-
ter of certain needed “Socialistic” enter-
prises ; on the other hand, it is perfectly
certain that the State “Liberal” party—in
accordance with its immemorial practice—
will swallow its rival’s policy whole at the
first opportunity. In plain language the
shindy in Macquarie-street, with all its pub-
lic scandal and expense, arises solely from
the desire of the Wade push to acquire the
salaries that are now being drawn by the
McGowen push. It is not contended any-
where that the State is being worse run at
present than it would be if Wade, Wood
and Co. held the fort. No one but an im-
becile would suggest that damage is going
to accrue to N. S. Wales by Willis being
left in the Chair till the Amended Electoral
and Redistribution of Seats Bills are made
law. Simply, the WADE-ites yearn for office
with a hunger like unto that of a drug-fiend
for his dope. To gain that end they have
cheerfully transformed the Assembly, con-
cerning whose “honor” they cant so loudly,
into a howling jest, and unless they can
frighten Willis out of the Chair (which
looks unlikely) or induce one of the
“Liberal” leagues to bang or otherwise lynch
him (which seems more or less possible)
they look like keeping the disreputable up-
roar going for an indefinite period. It is an
aspect of the Party Government game that
has never been presented quite so frankly
before; and those electors who don’t give a
blank for the personal fortunes either of
Wade, on the one hand, or of McGowen on
the other, but whose money and other valu-
able assets are being squandered over the
shameful salary-scrap, will do well to make
a note of it.
“0.1 v.” writes from beside Tait’s old rail-
ways :
The latest smash on the Vie. railways recalls the
strange incident of a Melbourne solicitor being- re-
cently attacked by a Crown Law officer on a question
of costs incidental to a railway accident case. Un-
doubtedly, the effect of that remarkable legal occur-
rence was to increase the Railway Department’s
power of bluffing the victims of accidents into accept-
ing the Department’s prompt offers of paltry compen-
sation, rather than resort to legal advice. The first
thought of the Department, when it is “up against” a
costly catastrophe, is to keep the lawyers at bay. In
this endeavor a number of medical men are practi-
cally allies of the Department, which, under favorable
conditions, is prepared to pay their bills without a
murmur. The claims agent solemnly warns battered
and shattered claimants against trusting their causes
to “legal sharks.” For the “shark” is likely to
bite, say, £250 out of the Department, of which
amount he will devour, say, £5O in costs, after pay-
ing 20 guineas or less to the doctor. How much
better for the departmental claims agent to persuade
the patient to accept £5O net and “avoid the risk
of litigation.” In such a case the doctor assists
to arrange the settlement can depend on getting his
account for, say, 40 guineas, passed by the Depart-
ment. Then there is no “unpleasantness”—and the
Department saves, say, £lOB net. Also, the patient
loses £129 by having nothing to do with a “shark.”
The latest smash on the Vic. railways had its natural
result in the prompt despatch from Melbourne of a
casualty train, bearing the claims agent and four
specially-summoned surgeons to the scene of small and
early compensations.
When the Commonwealth Parliament put
up its members’ pay to the living wage of
£6OO a year there were 11 stalwarts who
refused to touch the extra £2OO a year until
the electors had told them that it wasn’t
burglary, or embezzlement, or two-up, or any
other such pastime. W. Elliott Johnson,
however, weakened after a month or so, and
collected his outraged virtue in hard
cash, and Findley and Pulsford followed
some time later. By that time their out-
raged virtue was worth £519 apiece. John
Quick woke up to the outrage a couple of
days late, but, after two months of self-
denial, he caved in, and thereafter signed on
with the publicans and sinners. George
Fairbairn’s conscience slumbered f-rom
August 28, 1907, to January 1, 1910; then
the rattle of an approaching general election
woke it up, and he faced the electors wearing
the white robe of martyrdom; bargain price,
£27 19s. 6d. Only one man seems to have ob-
served that the country didn’t say anything in
particular about the £6OO at the general elec-
tions which happened in 1910; consequently
only one — Cameron, the wealthy Tasmanian
landowner —has gone on paying the extra
£2OO into the Consolidated Revenue Fund
until this date. As, no doubt, he knows
Cameron better than the electors do, he
probably thinks it a shame to take the
money.

No wonder the Sydney Delirium Tremens
demands fair play. During a recent Oppo-
sition riot in the N.S.W. Assembly, Han-
sard had the audacity to report as follows:
Dr. Arthur: Do I understand from you (the
Speaker) that the motion which I moved, that the
Clerk read certain extracts, has been ruled out of
order by you ?
Mr. Speaker: If the hon. member needs the intelli-
gence, I will tell him finally that I have already told
him twice that he is out of order.
Sydney Telegraph reported the incident
thus:
Dr. Arthur: Do I understand that my motion that
the Clerk read the extracts is ruled out of order?
The Speaker: If tht hon. member is lacking in
intelligence I will tell him.
Opposition members: That is insulting.
The Speaker: I have told him twice already that
he is out of order.
And the Telegraph, being desirous of seeing
fair play prevail at all hazards, shrieked in
its leading columns that no member should
“have to submit to personal insult. Last
night,” it continued, “the Speaker reflected
from the chair upon a member’s intelligence.
If the member made a similar comment on
the Speaker’s intelligence the police could
have been called to drag him out of tlm
House.” The Bulletin now moves that
the hon. member for Hansard be no further
heard. He appears to be a prejudiced per-
son or even worse.

Australian’s ignorance in re the King's

tion copies of two circulars from the Inter-

Darkness brooded over the moiys expensive
seats in Her Majesty’s (Sydney), as late
animals (the writer set down “arrivals,” but
the compositor thought he knew better, and
it is quite possible that he was right) dropped
heavily into their plush chairs, and Marshall-
Hall waved his wand over the magic music
of Wagner’s introduction to “Lohengrin.”
The orchestra got into action at 7.45 p.m.,
and the finest performance of the present
opera season was stamped on for five min-
utes by the boots of an occasional person
who fell off a step. Wagner puts the soul
of Lohengrin into that mystic prelude, and
the Early Worm turned with fury on the
Habitually Late. Soprano Jeanne Ivorole-
wicz-Wayda, the Elsa of Saturday ' night’s
cast, beat her own record—the one she built
up in “Madame Butterfly”—and flapped her
white-winged drapery in heavenly melody
during a large area of four acts. Wayda-
Elsa made her supreme effort in her address
to the moon from the castle balcony. Clem
Wragge says the moon is dead, so it is
natural that there was no reply. Wagner’s
declamatory music fits the drama tic Zeni
"LOHENGRIN ” AT HER MAJESTY'S ,
SYDNEY.
The King (Edmund Burke) announcing
" Lohengrin" (Zeni) the winner of Saturday's
big fight. Telramund (Scandiani) knocked out
in one round.
like a French glove, and, as Lohengrin, the
silver-plated knight, the long-legged tenor put
all his emotions into his objection to tell his
name and his age to Elsa, who was bitten
with the same curiosity as Statistician
Knibbs. If the lady had asked him where
he got that hat he would probably have re-
mained just as uncommunicative. Scandiani
never gives the critic a chance to stick a
pen into his performance, add his trick of
finished craftsmanship is likely to keep him
in drinks, cough lozenges and tram tickets
for another century. As Frederic of Telra-
mondo, Scandiani and his Ortrud-Cisneros
were superbly matched. Cisneros, if by any
chance she should ever take to drama, would
step into the slippers which are getting
rather loose, on Bernhardt’s elderly feet. In
the meantime, Eleanora’s mezzo-soprano
voice-box is worth a well-grown paddock of
gold coins every pay day. Cristiani, the
herald, is also worth more than one penny,
and on Saturday night he acquired some
new advertising matter for his excellent per-
formance. “Lohengrin,” with Marshall-Hall
to steer the Scheldt swan ferry, was, in spite
of weak spots in the chorus, a magnificent
production.
** * #
“The Speckled Band,” at Sydney Royal,
is of brooding horror and mystery and sen-
sationalism all compounded. The march of
events is perfectly credible, provided the
audience accepts such premises as a homici-
dal maniac, in charge of two step-daughters
whose death means wealth to him, and whom
lie ill-uses, yet who make no real effort to
escape from the danger-zone; and a houseful
of servants so devoted to the maniac that
they aid and abet his villainies with some-
thing approaching enthusiasm; and a few
other similar trifles. Granted such a situa-
tion as the above, it only remains for the
plot-weaver to decide how the step-daughters
shall be exterminated. The maniac, being a
medical lunatic, might have inoculated them
with diphtheria or plague germs. A thou-
sand bizarre endings suggest themselves.
What the demented medico decides on ulti-
mately, is to import from India a musical
snake which, on a certain air, or lilt, or
roundelay, or what-not being played to it,
swarms down bell-ropes and stings' people to
death. The scheme comes to naught, in the
case of the second step-daughter, partly
owing to the infernal acumen of Sherlock
Holmes, partly because of the snake’s musi-
cal proclivities. Had the ophidian been a
silent worker not even the genius of the
great Baker-street reasoner would have
availed to snatch* Enid Stonor from the tomb.
Gaston Mervale, as Dr. Rylott, lays him-
self out to make his audience’s flesh creep.
And when he crouches in the eerie gleam of
the calcium and fondles his horrible pet,
grinning wolfishly the while; and also when
he assaults his long-suffering servants;‘and
likewise at other times he succeeds admir-
ably. His make-up is a work of art. Wil-
liam Desmond is a poor Holmes. lbs
Yankee voice, Irish face, robust form and
vigorous method ill accord with the familjar
figure of Conan Doyle’s tall, tired, cadaver-
ous Englishman. James Atholwood does un-
impeachable work as Rodgers, the battered,
broken-spirited old butler. Cyril Mackay
would be more satisfying as Dr. Watson
were he less brushed-up and curled and
generally beautiful. A consideration of the
dusty and archaic top-hats and distorted
frock-coats which pervaded Sydney during
the recent Medical Congress might have
helped Mackay to realism in the role. Miss
Dorothy Dix looks charming, and invests'the
girl who is saved with a good deal of pathos,
and the subsidiary parts are well done.'
# * *
“Lady Frederick” has been filling the Cri-
terion during the past week, and looks like
doing so for the next fortnight, when, so far
as Sydney is concerned, the Ethel Irving
season ends. It is right that this should be
so. Prince Foote, Victor Trumper, Jack
Johnson, Ethel Irving—these are top-
notchers in their several spheres whom none
should miss seeing at work.

“Nobody’s Daughter” has been at the
Palace now for three weeks, and the public
loves her as much as ever. The sniffle of the
confirmed sentimentalist will be heard at

As regards the trouble which rages six
nights a week at the Amphitheatre, this
paper’s representative reports from the front
that the situation is
unchanged. Maude
Mortimer is still
battling gamely on.
Jordan and Harvey,
who have been fight-
ing the good fight
now, for well-nigh a
month, are still un-
beaten. Johnson and
Wells continue in the
thick of their engage-
ment. Next Satur-
day the management
threatens to call up
reinforcements, and
then the famous Am-
phi. arena should be
a truly stirring Spec-
tacle.
The Bulletin has consulted the Adelphjc
Oracle, and learns that “The Fatal Wed-
ding” will roll up its trousseau and take the
track on Friday. Next evening (Saturday),
“Humping the Bluey,” an Australian bush-
ranging piece, will unroll its swag, boil its
billy, and camp on George Marlow’s door-
step until further orders.

The picture shows are waiting hard
for something exciting to turn up and
provide films to liven things. We may
have the Italian war in a week or
two. Meanwhile, the Lyric and the
two Colonials are keeping the wolf from
howling through the keyhole. “The Arm-
strong Foundry,” an industrial film, and
“Hat-making in the Philippines” will be the
Lyric’s main props for the next few days.
Colonial No. 1 shows some good views of
“The Festival of Empire,” and Colonial No.

and Caruso selections on the Talk-o-phone
by way of discount or coupons for cash.

If it ever occurred to a great man, with

Adelaide Literary Theatre has got in first
in presenting George Calderon’s “Fountain”
to Australia. The rack-renting, tenement-
room theme has caused a talk of plagiarism
from “Widowers’ Houses,” but Calderon
(who is not to be confused with the
Spaniard) laughs at the idea. Shaw, he
says, is old-fashioned in introducing a heart-
less landlord. “Villains are a literary in-
vention wljich the Elizabethan drama in-
herited from , the demonology of the Middle
Ages. All the evil “that matters” is done
to-day "by good intention working through
the complicated channels of our social sys-
tem. His printed play shows a Mammon-
fountain spouting gold into a poor man's
lmt. but it breaks tlirough the frail hat, aiid
so tails back where it came from. That is
just the play, one extra-large-sized coinci-
dence being required to help it out. A so-
ciety butterfly goes slumming in one of Lon-
don s worst bits, and throws money about.
A pawn-system in which the pawner retains
the article pledged is one of her bright ideas.
Lveryone bleeds her. She tells her trustees
she wants a bigger income, and unexpect-
edly she 'gets it. But all the crowd she helps
is getting its rent raised; and she (or her
trust estate) turns out to be the owner of
the whole district! The acting was good in
parts, new players getting a big chance. Most
ot the fat went to Kathleen Laurence as the
charmingly idiotic heroine, and Arthur Smith
as her lazy, epigrammatic husband. (Cal-
deron’s dialogue is fully as brilliant as
Shaw s. ) Among a host of minor characters
was Wilfrid Neill, as an old Pacific Islander
who has left his happy home for England,
under the- amazing delusion —the logical re-
sult. of missionary talk —that it is “Jesus
Christ’s” special headquarters.
The “Arcadians” co. has farewelled at
Adelaide Royal in “The Belle of Brittany,”
and Miss Gertrude Gilliam, much regretted,
moves on to marriage and retirement. Tom
Walls Huntlcyised as skilfully in “Hook of
Holland” as he Lesterised in Peter Doody’s
part. At present the Royal is preparing for
pantomime. The Tivoli has a lot of new
stars, including Ossipoff, of Moscow. The
three Reeces, from America, make their first
Australian appearance. They are fine musi-
cians. and the juvenile member, a girl hardly
in her teens, gives a surprising contortion
turn. The Iving’s puts up Harcourt Beatty
and Dorothy Grimston in a “sketch,” Lon-
don fashion ; and the rest is mostly pictures
and concerts —notably a State-schools’ com-
bined effort known popularly as the Thou-
sand Voices Concert. •
In “The Bells,” which will last two weeks,
at Her Majesty’s (Melb.), H. B. Irving
gives a fairly forcible presentation "of the
famous character created by his father. The
performance is imitative to a fault—to many
faults, in fact. He is unduly hysterical in
his outbreak with his daughter’s young man,
when the lime-kiln theory is suggested, and
when he starts to dance, though, in that, case,
he may plead that Mathias has been drink-
ing. What seemed naturally eccentric in
Henry Irving of yore seems rather forced
in his son. The genius for theatrical in-
tensity is not there, but a very good talent
for it is there, and, in a number of intensely
theatrical situations, where bystanders and
by-sitters have to carefully ignore his con-
science-stricken appearance, H. B. frying
holds his own. In the lighter domestic epi-
sodes, his only conspicuous weaknesses are
a habit of blowing kisses to his daughter, as
though she were a tea-room girl, and an
occasional tendency, when alone, to lapse into
a suggestion of Dubose, of “The Lyons
Mail.” Minor character parts are well
played by Vibart and Reynolds. The Chris-
tian of Erie Maxon is manly, but not as
exuberantly happy as the atlianced husband
of Miss Irene Browne ought to be. And the
little crowd of guests in the second act —being-
members of the co., and not supers borrowed
for the occasion—give life to the scene. Un-.
fortunately, the brevity of “The Bells” neces-
sitates a curtain-raiser, which is the same
“A Maid of Honor” that preceded “The
Lyons Mail.” It is an utterly unconvincing-
playlet, unnaturally performed, and, if it
were put on as an afterpiece, instead of as a
curtain-raiser, (he audience would be offered
a rare opportunity to make an early escape.

At the Princess’s; the season of Bedfordian
drama was closed on the seventh night of
“The Lady of the Pluck-up.” A bad start had
practically killed the season for money-mak-
ing purposes; therefore, Bedford preferred
to throw his other two Australian plays out
of training, rather than run them without a
hope of .a big win. The theatre is closed
until Saturday, when George Marlow re-
sumes business with “A Girl’s Temptation.”
This purely-British production is the work of
a lady, who also wrote “How Girls are
Brought to Ruin,’’ from which it is slirewdlv
suspected that tlje narrative has an evil
gentleman in the base.

Nicola, the amiable wizard with the
Yankee twang, is performing at the Athen-
aeum Hall all those tricks that he couldn’t
afford to leave undone, and doing none that
he ought not to have done! The wizard
has a wide assortment of illusions and de-
ceits, and a happy, unassertive manner of
passing the time away. He handles the
kiddies—-and children on the stage are the
most effective tricks in a conjurer’s reper-
toire—with an art which places him on a
pedestal in the estimation of parents, guar-
dians and maiden aunts.
Two times last week “Candida” came to
light at the. Repertory Theatre. From the
point of view of everybody who brings an
elastic imagination to bear on an amateur
performance of an oddly-interesting comedy,
’the entertainment deserved all the encourage-
ment it got. The six characters in “Can-
dida” talk exceedingly well, and have each
an air of reality. The three who have to
do with the plot—the husband, the wife, and
the youthful poet whom the matron at-
taches to her apron-strings awhile —are im-
nossiblv placed, but, if they formed a perfect
triangle, there would be no plot with a pre-
tence of a social problem in it. Perhaps
Bernard Shaw’s pretence of a problem is not
meant to be taken seriously. It centres in
the unworldly puet who claims to have a
secret in his heart. Seeing that he finally
takes his secret out into the night, whilst
the parson and his wife indulge in common-
place connubial endearments, and are said
by the author (in his book of explanation)
to remain ignorant of the secret aforesaid,
one may reasonably assume that the poet is
not so much a humah being as a peg to
hang a controversy on. Candida herself is
inexplicable for only as long as she appears
to lean to the inexplicable boy. When she
gently pushes him off the premises, she is
revealed as a solid fact. Miss Maud Grant-
ham looked the name part more nearly than
she played it. but, with a little less delibera-
tion in speech, she would have seemed quite
at home. Archibald Strong converted the
tender-hearted, visionary Socialist of Shaw’s
play into a rather hard type of practical
parson-endeavorer, without spoiling the ef-
fect of contrast in characterisation. The wild
poet was vividly suggested by Lyle Christian,
and the casual curate and spinster type-
writer created more impression of truth than
the impersonator of Candida’s vulgar papa
was able to dispel. In a capital little one-
act comedy by Gertrude Robins—titled
“Makeshifts” —-the two dull, prosaic sister
characters were accurately indicated, Gregan
McMahon helping the lady amateurs
through. The bill for this week is “The
Fountain.” and on Monday next “The Voy-
se.y Inheritance” will be staged.

THE BELLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To H. B. Irving’s roadside pub., some fifteen
years a£o,
■V pious Polish Hebrew came a-sleighing
through the snow;
lie wore a fur-lined coat and cap, the climate
being cold ;
The belt that kept his stummick warm was
thickly lined with gold.
The landlord, having debts to pay, and
nothing in the bank,
Cast longing eyes upon the belt, and coveted
its clank ;
So, when Levinsky left the pub, poor, un-
suspecting Jew !
He disappeared, and, where he went, well,
Irving Only knew —
Who, from That time, in commerce throve
and verjy wealthy grew.
The murderer in peace abode, a Burgomaster
now,
Despite the awful brand of Cain upon his
furrowed brow ;
Until his conscience chanced to get a psycho-
logic twist:
He went to town and paid a bob to see a
Mesmerist,
Who waved, his subjects off to sleep, and
prompted them to say
The things best left unsaid—in short, they
“gave themselves away.”
And then the fear of being made to do the
same as these
Unhinged the Burgomaster’s mind and shook
him in the knees.
He went back home quite sick at heart, and
sadly ill kt ease.
Just here is where the drama starts to pub-
lish Irving’s woes,
The other incidents occurred before the cur-
tain rose.
Awake, he hears those sleigh bells ring the
death-knell of a Jew,
And sees a vision of the man whom long ago
he slew.
Asleep, he dreams a Court of Law, and in a
dreamy mist.
He plays his murder scene before the fatal
Mesrherist;
And when wife and daughter (who is
shortly to be wed)
Are summoned by his nightmare shrieks to
pull him out of bed.
The Burgomaster, partly dressed, makes faces
—and is dead.
VICTORIA.

AT POVERTY POINT.
One smart little Australian musical comedy artiste
in London is said by be-Fogged Antipodeans to be
“right down to it.” The alcohrol habit is held re-
sponsible. At the same time, it must be remembered
that there is hardly a woman on the stage who
hasn’t at one time or another been credited with an
abnormal craving for alcohol. As for the men, they
are mostly rumored to drink out of the bottle.
“Pittite”: Oh, the happy ending! “Lyons Mail”
again. Never mind the facts. Kipling had to
mangle “The Light that Failed” at the publisher’s
dictation. Jesse Boot, the big English chemist, with
200 shops, distributes shoals of novels. He dictates to
publishers as to what authors should do. Pinero’s
“Profligate” had to be despoiled of its logical finish.
A wonder the sensitive public ensured the end of
“Mrs. Tanqueray,” but Pinero had grown into a
strong man by that time. .Why doesn’t Lady Isabel,
of “East Lynne,” get well, and hug-mug, while the
other Mrs. Carlyle is shot by a burglar? “The
Octoroon” was played through America with its
proper, dismal finish, but Boucicault had to alter it,
at the rise-up of the London' public. The climax
of bathos was reached by “The Lyons MaCil” being
acted with the miserable and happy finishes on alter-
nate nights. Gaston Mervale is a well-known stickler
for proper stage logic and illusion. On the first
night of “Sunday,” in Melbourne, he made, the cur-
tain-rise at the end of the first act ridiculous. He
had beep shot. When the curtain popped up he was
rising to his feet. I cannot help thinking Gaston did
this on purpose.
Flo Graupner, gaily remembered by Australian
lovers of Gilbert and Sullivan, has quite recovered
from her long illness. She sings beautifully, looks
remarkably youthful, and retains her girlish talent.
Her return to the stage, though it may not be imme-
diate, is now considered probable. She has been
seen in a Melbourne audience lately.
“D.”: I tip as a coming musical comedy star,
Dorothy Brunton, daughter of scenic-artist Brunton,
deceased. She can’t be more than 18. She is pretty
and knows how to wear her clothes. She moves as
gracefully as Fanny Dango, and dances nearlv as
well. And she has a large, tuneful and cultivated
voice. On her recent work in “The Balkan Princess”
and “The Waltz Dream” she must forge ahead; else
is there something peculiarly rotten in the taste of
stagedom.
Dolly Castles, recently returned from London to
Australia, tells a press interviewer the exact value
she places upon an actress’s complexion: “I had
such a shock the other day. Mabel Russell, of the
Gaiety Theatre, married, a few months ago, Mr. Stan-
ley Rhodes, nephew of Cecil Rhodes, and I was their
chief bridesmaid. I got a cable telling me they
have had a dreadful motor smash. Mr. Rhodes \yas
thrown out and killed on the spot—poor fellow, he
was only 21 —and Mabel was terribly gashed about
the face. She gets £40,000 a year and a third of
his property, but that won’t make up for the gashes
will it?”
“Cockaigne”: Irving’s Mathias is almost a replica
of his illustrious father’s. In imagination we are at
the Lyceum in 1871, when the venturous actor would
say: “This is the night which either makes me or
foredoes me quite.” Business had been bad. Bate-
man had vainly tried to persuade George Rignold to
replace Irving, who was nowhere as Landrv to Miss
Bateman’s Fanchon, in “The Cricket.” Irving had a
difficulty in persuading Bateman to put “The Bells”
on, because a version was in preparation at,-another
house. (This, by the way, was brought out, and
proved a frost.) The bill on Irving’s grand night
opened with the farce of “My Turn Next,” with
Belmore as Taraxicum Twitters. Irving’s turn next!
The furore was indescribable. The great actor, the
leader of the stage, had arrived. Yet how cautious
were the press notices. Turning up the London
Athenaeum, of the year before, 1 find that Irving s
Digby Grant was “creditable.” It would not do for
him to be too good, with managers Montague and
Thorne in the cast. So the press treated his Mathias
as rather fluky. What a lot it takes to set the tide
going. But when it does go! Why, Irving could
even act Romeo, in which Australians thought him
hideous.
“Locust”: The people who grumbled during the
11. B. Irving season about the gruesomeness of
“Hamlet,” and said that the realism of the. whole-
sale murders in that philosophic play got on their
nerves, ought to give the opera co. a wide berth.
In “Traviata” the lady dies of consumption; in
“Boheme,” another heroine —a fat soprano—succumbs
to a mixture of consumption and starvation, so far
as a layman can diagnose the disease; in “Carmen,”
one character is gored to death by a bull, while
the heroine is basely assassinated by her former
lover; in “Samson and Delilah” there is treachery,
butchery and universal slaughter in the last act ; in
“Faust” the lady is ruined by the influence of the
Evil One, her berrother is slaughtered by her seducer,
and she goes mad at the very top of her register
and is rescued by angels; and “Romeo and Juliet”
winds up with something like what is described in an
Evenooze headline as “Double Murder and Suicide.”
The only peaceful and bloodless ending appears to
be in “Lohengrin,” where the hero leaves his wife in
tears, and goes gently back to the place he came
from, accompanied by the faithful goose. Yes, the
opera plot is a deluge of blood, and a debauch of
murder and evening newspaper headlines.
“Harrison O.”: How painfully unoriginal is stage
nomenclature. In Melbourne we have lately had
another drama, in which a brace of Russians figure,
and. of course, they are our old friends Sergius and
Olga. I am weary of the monotonous procession of
Russian Olgas; also of Hebrew Abrahams, and of
domestics named Jane. Who ever met a slavey who
would answer to such a name? The ones I know are
mostly Veronica and Geraldine. Again, a sporty old
diplomatist in “The Merry Widow” was labelled
Baron Popoff; now, in “The Chocolate Soldier,” we
meet a sporty military ancient, who is introduced as
Colonel Popoff. This sort of blank unoriginality in
the naming of characters is in evidence in every
fresh play produced; and, I repeat, I am fatigued.
A Melbourne weekly recently informed its readers
that at one of the picture shows “a thrilling drama,
‘ln the Hands of the Importers,’ ” was being
screened. Possibly it meant “impostors,” but the
comp., musing on his ruined British-made hat,
reckoned the terms were synonymous.
This paper has been asked to intimate that a Phila-
telic Congress will pervade Sydney from the 12 th to
the 21st inst. George V., who has amassed stamps
for as long as he can remember, is the patron of the
Sydney Philatelic Club, and he will be with it in
spirit if not in person. Some valuable collections
will be exhibited; one herd of these tokens, belong-
ing to H. L. White, of Scone, is alleged to be worth
£25,000, or thereabouts. The Bulletin doesn’t
personally see much point in philately, but it is ob-
viously worthier to collect stamps than bookies’
tickets, or wreaths of beer-leaves, or whisky breaths,
and to that extent, at least, the coming Congress
stands for Righteousness.
“Simplicitas”: Advanced drama is perhaps ham-
pered in its progress to popularity by the vague
high-sounding criticism that attaches to it. For in-
stance, Melbourne Age said of Bernard Shaw’s
“Candida,” at the local Repertory Theatre: “It is
beyond question a play delightful to listen to; de-
lightful because of the delicate mastery of all those
materials against which the average dramatist wages
such heavy war.” The assertion that commonplace
dramatists make onslaughts on “materials” (what-
ever that may mean 1) follows the bewildering asser-
tion that: “Of course the conventions suffer, but
the deeper emotions, though they are always talked
about, are never really in the play.” Now, how is
the average commonplace playgoer to get an interest
in Shaw’s work by learning that it damages the con-
ventions without disturbing the deeper emotions of
human kind? As a matter of fact, “Candida” may
seem shallow or deeply emotional, according to the
force of imagination brought to bear in considering
its story. It amounts to a conflict of conventional
With* unconventional argument upon the deepest of
human emotional questions, and the apostle of un-
conventionality gets more completely “left” than in
some of the comparatively orthodox" problem plays.
The quaint dwarf comedian, “Little Tieh,” whom
Rickards brought to Australia, has published a sort
of autobiography in London. He must be a good
deal older than he looks, as his professional name
dates from the Tichborne trial time —and that is
close on 40 years ago. He wanted first, he says, to
be a policeman, and when he couldn’t be a police-
man, he pined to be a soldier; but his fate was
finally decided by a successful appearance with a
tin whistle in a Gravesend music-hall.
“Lud”: Harrv Irving was born in ’7O, the year of
his father’s success in “Two Roses,” but the year
before the mighty hit of “The Bells.” The mother
kept the two ooys. They appeared, against their
father’s wish, in a bazaar at the Knightsbridge
Riding School, in scenes from “The School for
Scandal.” H. Irving was six years at Marlborough
school, and three years at Oxford. There he acted
Brutus in “Julius Caesar,” Strafford in Browning’s
tragedy, and King John. First public appearance
as Beaufoy, in “School,” at the Garricit (1801).
Acted Dick Sheridan at the Comedy (’94). In the
provinces he acted Julian in “Diplomacy,” Pomander
in “Masks and Faces,” Evelyn in “Money,” Charles
Surface, Melnotte, Young Marlow, Hamlet, Leontes
in “Winter’s Tale,” Romeo, Othello, Benedict, Or-
lando and Jaques, Digby Grant in “Two Roses,”
Marcus Superbus, etc. In London he played Crichton
(1902), Hamlet (’O5), lago (’O6). At the Shaftes-
bury he produced ‘The Lyons Mail,” “Charles 1.,”
and “Louis X 1.,” and “The Bells” at the Queen’s.
Mrs. Irving is a daughter of J. F. Baird, barrister.
Her first appearance was as Iris in “The Tempest,”
with the Oxford Dramatic Society (1894). Harry
Irving, then studying for the Bar, was present. They
married in ’96. Their boy and girl are named
Laurence and Elizabeth. Du Maurier chose her for
Trilby, after seeing her portrait in an illustrated
paper.

To give the city pros, a shock.

But every night he moves the scenes !

RHEUMATIC PAINS RELIEVED.
“I have been a great sufferer from rheumatism,”
writes Mrs. Jane Pierce, 1340 Sturt St., Ballarat
(Vic.). “The excruciating pains have caused me
hours of misery. I thought I would never get relief,
but the first bottle of Chamberlain’s Pain Balm
showed me it was possible. Now, at the first signs
of the rheumatic pains returning, I apply hot fomen-
tations, then rub Chamberlain’s Pain Balm well in,
and it certainly wards off what used to be days of
pain and suffering.”*
Aching Back.
The bane alike of the housewife and of the work-
ing man. In some cases every movement of the body

which will act in a surprisingly prompt manner.

SOCIETY
PENFOLD'S
WINES
The most mysterious thing about Vic-
ttoria’s newest railway smash is not how it
happened—nobody could expect much else
•on the Mansfield-Yea line with the worn-out
rolling stock the department uses—but that
every one of the 20 occupants of the wrecked
•car wasn't an immediate corpse. The ram-
shackle vehicle first collided with the bridge,
then somersaulted down 35ft. of embank-
ment, next bumped on an overturned truck
and parted from its undercarriage, and
finally fell to pieces, the roof coming right
away, and the passengers being mostly shot
out pell-mell. Even when thev had got
clear of the debris and shaken themselves
together, it wasn’t the department’s fault
they didn’t die of shock or hunger or dis-
gust, for it took four hours for a casualty
van with medical assistance to reach the
scene. But, again, the department’s luck
stood good—doctor, nurse and private hos-
pital happened to be but a few miles away,
and were available in short order. Also, the
local inhabitants came out in force with aid
and drink. But that abiding luck is being-
strained to the breaking point.
The fact that the lost Rosedale, the North
Coast (N.S.W.) steamer which David Jones
snatched for supper one furious night re-
cently, was 34 years old, calls attention to
the ages of other arks that bob and stagger
on the roof of the hollow-sounding and
mysterious main hereabouts. The tug Bun-
Siree pleads guilty to 50 years, the c> liter
•erwent to 47, the Barrabool to 37, and the
Lubra to 36. The passenger ship City of
Grafton is 35 years old; the P’linders 33;
the Namoi 28. The record of age on the
Australian register is held by the barge
Augustus. Built in 1814, this ancient and
fish-like denizen is alleged to be still afloat —
in Geelong harbor, of course. No other
place but Geelong would venture to boast
of a vessel 97 years of age.
“Brass Button,” who is first officer on the
s.s. Bottomless, sends an airgram:—
Those people whose business is taking them on
deep waters are getting an conviction
that the waters are not deep enough, and that they
who “go down to the sea in ships” take a fair risk
of going to the bottom of the sea in ships. Reports
have been getting a bit too frequent of “uncharted
rocks” sticking up on the very doormat of our har-
bors for ships to stub a toe against going in or out.
The latest is that the Oswestry Grange “struck
some submerged obstacle” in the entrance to Port
Alma. She was right in the fairway, was in charge
of a capable pilot, and was not deep-loaded, so the
mystery is why some other ships haven’t scraped
their insides out over the same object. No inquiry
was held, and nothing has been done except that the
Marine Board has issued a notice as long as the
deep-sea lead-line, warning masters who negotiate
the entrance to keep certain beacons in line;, sidestep
their own, width, and keep another lot in line ; turn
to the left and mind the step when some other
beacons are nearly on ; keep a stiff upper lip, and
hope for the best when some more are seen to the
southward, and so on. The Board denies that the
warning issued is because of the Oswestry Grange
scratch. That only happened a month or so ago,
though nothing was heard publicly of it till lately,
and the Bored hasn’t had time to think about it.
This warning is the result of a similar accident that
hanpened to the s.s. Whakatarie ever so long ago. A
more extensive and up-to-date warning may be
issued in a few months. Meantime, I wonder what’s
to hinder the Bored from taking its coat off and dig-
ging the rock up by the roots.

The inoffensive, law-abiding Chow of Lilly
Bnck-stleet has again been pouring mud on
tlie faith of his trusting sympathisers. Ap-
parently Ah Sin took note of Citizen Wren’s
arrangements in the days when that enter-
prising person had a moated grange in Col-
lingwood and surveyed tlie law from his
battlements while be ran his tote inside.
Anyhow, Sin, finding the law’s raiding en-
terprises too frequent and too successful,
has reduced his opium joints to about half a
dozen ; but these are practically unraidable,
being fitted with double doors, iron-faced and
barred. Electric liglits serve the entrances
and and electric bells are controlled
from a seat alongside a small window over
the entrance. It would take the force half
an hour to raid one of these places, and long
before that everything would be in apple-pie
order, 1 whereupon a smiling Chow Fat would
unbar the door and casually inquire “Whaf-
for?” So the force says the only way to
make Sin keep the law is to abolish him;
and the force isn’t far out.

The 25,000 inhabitants are probahly the filthiest

finished us; and, after holding our noses through

Stirred up by the English
working man’s recent upheaval,
two English bishops arose last
week and talked as plainly as
they could. One said that he
believed the prevailing discon-
tent was justified; the other
declared that Christianity was
dead or becoming so. Neither
resigned his lucrative job, or
announced that in future he
would allow no collection to be
taken up in aid of foreign mis-
sions. Each will, presumably,
continue to wake the echoes of
his empty cathedral and send out
missionaries to force valueless
theological goods on the trust-
ful heathen. The average ec-
clesiastic is merely honest in
spasms; he doesn’t believe in
allowing his conscience to drive
him to extremes.
The State of Maine (U.S.A.), which has
been Prohibition for 50 years, recently de-
cided to remain “dry,” but the “dry” ma-
jority has become so very small that it
seems almost certain that the pubs are
coming back. Out of the nine North Atlan-
tic States Maine is the most thinly-peopled,
with less than 25 persons to the square mile.
The other eight States range from 39 people
to 508|. Between 1860 and 1870 (the anti-
liquor law began in 1851) the male popula-
tion of Maine decreased. According to the
Dictionary of Statistics the ekeess of births
over deaths (years 1901-5; no later figures
available) was five per 1000 inhabitants per
annum, against 12 in England and 17 in
Argentina The divorce rate is rather high.
Maine, in fact, seems to take its joys sadly.
John Perry, M.L.A., who recently de-
clared himself “damnified” by N.S.W. Speaker
Willis to the tune of £lOOO, is in hot water.
This is at Ballina, the capital of his elec-
torate, where the public kid finds no place
to rest the sole of his exercise book because
the white ants have chawed the desks, and
the roof is falling into the Euclid. Jawn,
who was Minister for Education in two
Governments, wrote a nice conciliatory let-
ter. the other day, to a meeting of protesting
parents, but the parents weren’t having any
more of the damnified party. What they
want to know is why Perry, in his five years
of office, didn’t repair the roof, and that is
what he can’t explain.
Melbourne Age is in trouble over some of its
statements concerning the administration of
the Customs in Westralia, and a, couple of
ex-officers of the Department want £2OOO to
square things. One of the two ex-officers
happens to have a parson-father, who has
taken his son’s trouble so much to heart that
he has’been almost living on Tudor’s door-
mat, trying to get an open inquiry of some
sort. When, finally, the Minister banged the
door and said that the Department had
nothing further to remark, the pertinacious
parent seems to have, so to speak, knocked
at the door of the Age in the hope of getting
an inquiry that way, the Age having printed
some of the things which the Departbient
has to say about the ex-officers’ share in the
alleged muddle in the West. The prohibited
Chow immigrant is the particular cause of
the row.

Melbourne mace, a number of years ago,
Brodzky was hauled up to the bar for pub-
lishing some imaginative history; but they
did not dare to punish him. That was a
really superb mace; McDonald’s abomina-
tion was a miserable imitation of gilded
wood. The real thing that the old trouble
was about seemed to have walked off after a
sort of banquet. Brodzky hinted that it
strayed in a tanglefooted way over to a
Lonsdale-street house; and a wild public
imagination fancied that it heard somebody
say, “Allow me—hie ! —to lay maish—hie !
on table.” Where did it go l Did a brigand
lay it on his shoulder and boldly stalk tort.i
down Bourke-street or towards Bitzroy-'
Why wasn’t somebody sacked? The Mystery
of the Mace beats the “Hansom Cab. Did
they search the Chinese Joss House. Is the
Ai-k of the Israelites still in the land of the
Philistines? Or has an Israelite got at it
long ago and pounded up the Shekinah tor
old gold?
THE COCKCROW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This is tlie world's overture, the cockcrow
With dulcet harmony, sweetly melodious
11 rouses me. In Sydney, Chicago,
llong Kong, London, New York, Paris, Rome,
San Fran., Tokio.
Any little town, little village, no matter where
I ’scape not the morning roosters,
And would not if I could.
Aha? Old friends, are you there?
Dim sounds as of ’phones crossing,
Or distant Marconi, from full throats.
Up ! Awake ! The clarions sound
Overture as musical as to “Tannhauser.”
Suppose I am in Woolloomooloo,
Do you not carry my thoughts to the speeding sun ?
On comes Apollo’s chariot
Over from the East. The horses with
Their bells of warning. Wake up Australia !
Fortify Port Darwin.
Old Sol’s eye looks here on richest prize,
The cruiser Hawke rips up the big Olympic
As swordfish doth a whale.
Suppose I am in London,
Snoozing on top of my big hotel,
I say: “Surely my old cronies ain’t here.”
But, bless you, they are! What’s this?
People keeping fowls in all sorts
Of out of the way places.
Cock-a-doodle-doo !
Echoing right from the east again,
Curling along the scimitar of the Thames,
All round St. Paul’s dome,
Amid tlie wilderness of dock rigging.
Cock-a-doodle!
All the young chaps trying their gullets.
Now I am in Rome. Surely not here —
Not in the Eternal City!
But in the Eternal City there’s the Eternal
Fellow, with the red fringe cut by scissors.
Whither away next? Ah, Paris!
Parigi O Cara! As Melba sings in “Traviata.”
Chere Paris. Chanticleer’s lusty throat
Sends music whelming round.
Now we get to Cliieawgo.
We heard the roosters start there
At three o’clock on Sunday afternoon.
Started by some stalwart Yankee one
With tarry dialect ;
Thick enough to cut with a knife,
lie was answered in crows Canadian,
Dago, , Chinese, English, Dutch, French, German,
Indian,
Irish, Hungarian, Russian, Scandinavian,
Scotch and Spanish. We understood not.
But they understood each other
.Like tongues at Pentecost.

One of the most grievous discrepancies
about woman is her failure to appreciate
high principle in others. It was, no doubt,
this weakness that recently allowed Mary
Langstaff, of Bendigo (Vic.), to have her
husband “bound over.” Langstaff, it ap-
peared, had come home and instructed his
wife lo say her prayers as she had only half
an hour to live. When she had dutifully
complied, Langstaff produced a revolver and
desired her to proceed to the bathroom so
that he might slay her in a tidy manner.
On her demurring to this he relented some-
what, saying he wasn’t sure. that it was
necessary for her to die just then, but he
would toss a coin and see—heads she be-
came deceased, tails she didn’t. She de-
murred to this also, as he might have a
double-headed penny; but he assured her all
was fair and square, and promptly flicked
the coin. It came down “tails,” and, being a
man of' his word, he put away the revolver
and requested her to boil the kettle and set
out the evening meal. Yet, next day, in
spite of all his lofty principles, in spite even
■of_bis tidiness, she had him bound over in
£i\ r >. So, if he kills her, he will owe the law
that sum in addition to being hanged.

“Tiald”;: M.aoriland is the champion place
of evanislijaieinit. Citizens walk out of their
.front doors iiintio God’s own sunshine or God’s
own frost and immediately disappear. A few
weeks ago there were five persons reported
absent from the roll-call. A few more have
gone on the list since then. Perhaps the
most curious episode is that of a young citi-
zen named James Kingdom late of Master-
ton. Some weeks ago he left his companions
at 12 o’clock mmnight, remarking that he
would scoot home. Home was about 300 yards
away, and at latest advices he was' seen
scooting. From that day to this not a ves-
tige. track, trace or sign of him has been
seen—he just simply vanished from human
ken. Joseph Powelka, the unfortunate who
got 21. years’ hard for pilfering furniture and
for being in a district where houses would
keep getting alight, is also among the miss-
ing. While he was leaning against his
prison bars they must have given way, for
it was found after his departure that they
had only been fixed in with wooden plugs
headed over with putty. Strenuous inquiries
after liis health by the M.L. police have
failed to bring the wanderer home again.
Public sympathy seems to be with Joseph, as
the police get all sorts of bogus information
and misdirection. It is riot considered wise
to ask a M.L. John Hop if he has learned
the “latest step.” Levanting Maorilanders
are now said to have “danced a Powelka.”
HE LOOKED LIKE IT.
“ The subject of our discourse this evening ,
dear friends , is Joy.”
AMOUNTS TO THE SAME THING.
TOM (jealously): “Hang Carter! One would

T ILLY: “ Well, he has a motor-car."
“Zachariah McTavish” : Saw a Melbourne
suburban furniture' dealer get it where it is
likely to do some good, the other day. Fol-
lowing the example of several other rooks,
this dealer had in his window a suite of
saddleback chairs, etc., which was well worth
£3O of anybody’s money, but which was
marked at £lO. The trick, of course, is that
the jay who buys the goods, not being able
to wrap them up and carry them home in
his pocket, receives at his residence some-
thing that looks the same, but is not the
same—not on your life. This day I am
speaking of, a Scotchman with a hooked
nose or a hooked nose with a Scotch accent
(his name, 1 believe, was Duncan Jericho),
walked into the shop, purchased the suite in
the window, planked down £lO, and was
given a receipt. “Where shall we send them,
sir?” asked the other shrewdy. “Send them
nowhere, mine friend,” was the answer;
“I’ve got de van outside.” Of course, the
-circus started just there, but the Yid from
Aberdeen waved his receipt, and threatened
the law —a limb of which, either by accident
or design, was gazing through the window.
When 1 left the £3O suite was being lumped
out of the shoo amidst blasphemy and
| counter cheers. I helped with the cheers.
At atmosphere of ironic pathos
envelops the Rockefeller Institute
for Medical Research, where, by
the way, an advanced surgeon is
said to have removed and replaced
one of the kidneys of a lady dog.
Rockefeller’s interest in medical re-
search is inspired by his own piti-
able state of health. As a financier
he is capable of eating two rail-
ways before breakfast, but as a
wreeky dyspeptic, who has to bathe
in whisky because he can’t take it
inwardly, the dismal multi-million-
aire has to keep himself quite
empty. What Rockefeller wants
medical research to discover is a
means of successfully performing
on himself in particular and folks
in genera] the operation which was
first tried upon the dawg. He fain would
have his own liver, kidneys and other inter-
nal fittings taken out and cleaned.
If there is such a thing as the germ of
unrest this is the time to look for it. The
same animal was loose in 1848, but the
germ theory was hardly known then, and
the beast wasn’t searched after. No doubt
most of the unrestful folk have good solid
grievances to kick ’ against; but the pecu-
liarity of the case is that fhe kick should
break out so simultaneously in such widely
separated places, and, with no visible cause
for its simultaneoufeness. The microbe 'of ,
kick should be investigated.
The Public Library of Adelaide has ac-
quired, by gift, from a daughter of the late
Judge Bundey, an interesting memento of
the Gothenburg wrdclr (March, 1875). It
is. a hasty note written by Blyth, then Pre-
mier of S. Australia, to Bundey, Minister
for the Northern Territory :
March 3, 1875. My dear Bundey,—The Gothen-
burg is wrecked somewhere near Flinders Island or
Cape. Two boats have been picked up. Three boats
are still missing. The line, is working badly. I
literally know no more. I shall telegraph Queens-
land Government, and render every assistance. Todd
knocked me up at 2 a.m. with this intelligence. I
told him not to go to Mrs. Wearing or Mrs. Whitby,
as they could do no good. Can you think of any-
thing?—A.B.
Wearing, a Judge, and Whitby, a Crown
Prosecutor, had been holding a Circuit Court
at Port Darwin. Both were drowned.
The Howard Smith Co.’s new liner, now
building, is to be called Canberra, after the
Federal capital. If it is as dry as its name-
sake, it will be one of the best sea boats in
the world.
“Petifi”: Now it
is known why the
an c i ent Romans
went to England
—t hey went to
pave the way for
the motor-car. The
British National
Road Board—crea-
ted to splash up
the petrol tax on
roads for motor
traffic lately
looked around for
a new cross-coun-
tr y track, and
found that the leg-
ions of the Csesars
or some other
short-s h i r t e d
blokes of old had
supplied the article
1900 years ago.
The name the Ro-
mans gave their
great thoroughfare
from Leicester to
Lincoln is as dead
as Pompey’s boots,
bu t the Saxons
called it the Fosse
W ay. For cen-
turies it has been
unused, except as
(occasionally) a
boundary line be-
tween parishes or
counties. A lone
farm-house here
and there borders
it, but no village
gets within coo-ee
of it. The survey-
ors who lately went
to awaken the an-
cient Sleeper found
it thickly covered
with briars and
thorns, and the old
side ditches were
overgrown and mire-choked: A lot of the his-
toric pavement had vanished, maybe to make
a sty for Hodge's haggard hog, but some of
it remained—good, dark sandstone blocks,
with small, smooth gravel packed in be-
tween. Now, the unpoetic navvy is filling
in the crevices with furnace clinker; and
soon this bit of the venerable Fosse Way
will be an up-to-date highway, where the
motor-car will romp odorousl.v, and hoot the
astounded ghost of Csesar’s chariot into the
ditch.
It is not often that a missionary puts the
truth about the Chow, and his cousin the
Jap, so bluntly as Dr. Karl Humm stated
it at a recent Melbourne meeting. Dr.
Ilumm believes the Asiatics to be a dying
set of races. The Chinese, Japanese and
the Hindoo, have long passed their culmina-
tion, and are now, he declares, on the down
grade. History, adds the doctor, gives no
example of a decaying race having a second
culmination. He compares a nation with
an individual:—
The old man was untrustworthy, immoral and sly,
unless he was influenced by. Christianity. On the
other hand, the young man went straight, reiving
chiefly upon his physical strength and youthful vigor
to pull him through, where the aged man had to
fall back upon craft. . . The Japanese bqsiriflss-m'in
was the most untrustworthy biLsinfess-man in the
world... There were individuals of each race who
were estimable persons, but they were not character-
istic of the race to which they belonged.
At the close of the address, the report con-
tinues. “the Rev. S. G. Maclaren defended
the Chinese.” It grieves the parson ter-
ribly to hear his beloved yellow brother
spoken of with disrespect.
“M.M.”: An Adelaide suburb was roused
to great eveitement the other day. The cause
was a noble sign in front of a church :

“Trotter” presents a triumph of incoher-
ency :
There are two African experts at present
in Australia —Dr. Kumm and John Kirk. Kumm
comes from the Soudan. Hardy missionary of
the real Livingstone, or, rather Emin Pasha sort.
Kumm has gone all over Africa from west to east, in
the thickest part. Curious business fetches him.
Over half a dozen Melbourne University fellows have
wanted to missionise in the Soudan, and Kumm’s job
is to gauge the physique, etc., and induce as many
other eligible Australians as possible to go. Danger
of Mahometanism swamping the Soudan. It seems
to advance quicker than Christianity. The Moollah
presents very simple ideas to the intelligent natives.
He says: “Christians have tlire’e gods ; we only have
one god.” I remember a Salvation Army man at
Echuea being gravelled by a Mahometan with this.
Grattan Guinness, lecturing in Australia, told how
he was confronted in Egypt by Mahometans with:
“What? God has a son? Terrible, terrible!” No
use sending ignorant men to grapple sharp ones of
other faiths. Well, the Melbourne students who
want to mission, find the South Seas dismal. The
Panama Cknal is going to kill out all the browns.
On the other hand, blacks in Africa will go ahead
as in the United States. Through privileges in Cape
State (only) a Kaffir, Mr. Kanegawa, has got'into the
South African Parliament, and the Zulu, shut out
even from voting, is more intelligent than the
Kaffir. Now turn to John Kirk, the other African
expert who happens to be in Australia. Better known
as the London Boys’ Friend. A director of the East
Africa Company. The Church Missionary Society,
established at Mombasa, on the Coast, since 1844,
proceeded to Uganda in 1877. Followed by Catho-
lics. Mahometans preceded both. Religious trian-
gular duel. In 1890 the Germans made a grab for
Uganda, but were frustrated by the British. The
East Africa Co. began to administer Uganda the
same year. British Government took possession 1893.
Railway service began from Mombasa to Uganda in
1901. As good a country as South Africa or Argen-
tina. Almost every climate at the varying heights.
Unsurpassed scenery. Unrivalled sport. More game
than anywhere else in the world. White children
thrive. The railway from Mombasa to Florence, on
Lake Victoria Nyanza, is 584 miles. From Florence
to Entebbe, Government headquarters, steamers go
175 miles over the lake. The steamers are big and
luxurious, about equal to the Mourilyan, which tra-
versed the Australian Barrier. All round the glori-
ous lake takes a week. English ports: Kampala and
Jinja, near the almost peerless Ripon Falls. German
ports: Shirati, Muanza, Bukoba. Mombasa is on an
island, which has a better harbor, Kilindini. Salis-
bury Bridge connects Kilindini with mainland.
Seventeen spans of 60ft. girders. In Nairabi, 326
miles from Mombasa, are the railway headquarters.
Game laws and licenses extremely precise with re-
gard to the many kinds of buck and antelope, the
giraffe, hippopotamus, elephant, buffalo, zebra, os-
trich, marabout, egret, and a host of other creatures.
Go as you please for lions. And they for you.

The beautiful story of the tragic passion
of the Austrian Archduke Rudolph (Alex.
Montgomery wrote a novel about it) is shat-
tered or shaken by the Montignoso coun-
tess’s memoirs. The old story was that the
hopeless lovers went together to the prince’s
“shooting-box” ; he slew her, heaped flowers
over her and then slew himself. Now, the
countess says that the lady, in an irate
moment, “bottled” the prince, breaking his
skull scientifically with a dead marine, and
that his suite then filled her with bullets.
Her yarn turns a Greek tragedy into an or-
dinary push episode. This spoils the story
for the romantic, but shows that even royal
love can behave like a native of the Rocks.

FAT MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It has been ascertained that members of the Vic-
torian police force almost invariably gain a stone in
weight during their first year’s service, and from
that on the increase is continuous, and much in ex-
cess of that of the average citizen.
The peeler slowly plods his' beat.
The exercise is just enough
To help his gastric juices meet
The daily need. Good filling stuff
Admiring cooks provide their dear, j
And honest Bung supplies' the beer. |
No wonder, then, the Conner grows
A marked rotundity, which bloats
His handsome regulation clo’s,
Which pleasing indolence promotes,
And makes him, in iiis doorway curled,
The heaviest sleeper in the world.
Who runs to waist is no success
In chasing wasters, so we see
’Twere better if the force were less
Conspicuous for immensitee.
Fat may be force- -a phrase oft heard—
But this fat forel is quite absurd.

“Smell” : I am surprised that belar hasn’t
been entered for the hardwood championship. My
first experience of it was when the boss supplied me
with an axe and instructions to “split that log over
there.” With the first “belt” I knocked chips off it
—the axe I mean. The next axe went the same way.
On my applying for a third axe, the boss came over
to investigate. “Why, you damfool,” said he, “that
ain’t the log! That’s belar!” I didn’t know; it
looked just like wood.
“Leo Lear”: A friend of mine has been
telling me of a trip on the Murray, and arousing
old recollections. I was also on the Big Trickle
once upon a time. It was during the hefty drought,
and ours was the last boat of the year, for the river
dried up soon after, as if it had been breathed upon
by Beelzebub. We started from Mildura for Swan
Hill with 30 passengers, and a barge towing behind
loaded with bones. With a hinder-wind, the odor
from this gruesome reminder from bare plains and
dry creeks would make a Chicago resident home-
sick. The old paddle-boat had bunks for six, and
couldn’t possibly stretch them to accommodate 30,
so the two dozen odd men slept in any in-or-out-of-
the-way corner. The last man had the choice of the
woodheap or a position next the funnel. On account
of the heat he chose the former, and got up every
half hour during the night to have a spell. To get
as far from the barge as possible I took quarters in
the bows, but about midnight we ran aground, and
I became entangled in the leadsman’s feet as he
probed the bottom with a long pole. Kicked and
cursed, I decamped to the position next the funnel.
The whole trip, which took 10 days, was a long
series of running on reefs and sand banks, varied
with the joy of being rammed in the stern by the
barge. The for’ard hand, with a long pole marked
at every foot, kept tally of the Huge Trickle’s
bottom, and at all shallows kept a continual call of
“Two foot, sandy”; “three foot, rocks” ; “no
bottom.” Anything over 3ft. was “no bottom.”
To pass the time we instituted a nap school, but nap
on a Murray boat in low river is apt to lead to dis-
putes. Whenever the old tub ran on a reef, counters,
cash, and cards slithered along the boards, and one
had just time to grab half his own and all his
mate’s property before the barge crashed into the
stern and sent things slithering all afresh. In a few
days ; tucker began to give out, and a deputation
waited On the skipper. But the Old Man, scenting
mutiny (the wind, at the time, must have been
blowing off the bones) told us that we had never
been better fed in our lives; and to divert attention
ordered us to load wood at the next stopping place.
The man who slept on the woodheap was the only
willing hand ; he thought he might get a few soft
pieces on board. To keep the passengers employed,
and to expedite matters at the reefs and bars, the
skipper used his human cargo as movable ballast.
When the boat struck bottom, the order was, “All
hands aft!” and we crowded in the stern and
watched the barge bearing down on us. We were
not all Bents or Reids, but our combined weight
was sufficient to raise the bows Heavenwards, and
half the boat heaved over the bar. Then, “All
hands for’ard!” rang out from the bridge, and we
rushed the bows, determined to reach Swan Hill if
we had to tread-mill our passage. With the bows
down and stern up, another heave was sufficient to
plunge our craft into deep water. Then, with much
foam and fuss she proceeded to drag the now
stranded barge after her. On Christmas day we
stuck fast on the “Bitch and Pups,” and all the
movable cargo afloat on the Murray couldn’t have
sent the bows up an inch. Having been tried and
found wanting, we were put ashore as useless, and
other means resorted to. Hawsers were tied on to
HONOR AMONG SPIELERS.
“’Ere, you thief, you're cheating! That ain’t
the 'and I dealt yer!"
red gums on either bank, fixed on the paddle shafts,
and wound’ up. The progress was sure, but slow,
and it was long after dark when the boat and barge
reached the “no bottom” stage. At dawn on the
tenth day we sighted Swan Hill; and at the same
moment our paddle-boat ran hard aground. “All
hands aft,” cried the old man. But mutiny was
abroad. Swan Hill meant tucker, and, besides, we
were off further see-sawing. In quiet, respectful
words, we made the fact known to the skipper.
Immediately the air became so thick with language
that we walked ashore on it. Without a backward
glance we made a line for the nearest pub. Lloyds
had posted us “missing,” and the whole Hill turned
out to make us welcome. I have since heard that
the boat did reach Swan Hill, and is to be sent ovei*
land to join the Cerberus in the next Easter
manoeuvres. If you doubt this yam, stand on the
Melbourne Treasury steps, and cry “Three foot,
sandy” ; and if I’m no liar, an answer will come up
Collins-street, “No bottom.”
“K. 8.”: Was blacksmith’s mate on a
station, where a pet emu did nothing for his living
but thieve, and came to a timely end thereby. We
were grafting away one day, with old George watch-
ing us very intently from the door. A piece of
white-hot iron had just been cut on a 2in. rod, and it
no sooner hit the floor than George made a wild grab
at it and tried to swallow it. He was. too slow.
With a sizz the roast metal fell through the
bottom of his beak, and the air was filled with the
incense of cooked horn. After that, as fast as he
put tucker into his mouth it fell out of the hole.
We plugged up the hole, but in another fit of
curiosity he ate the plug, and died of indigestion.

“Button-stick” : The Solomon Islands nig-
ger mothers mentioned by “Arlo,” and the African
ones alluded to by “Vagabond,” seem to have lost no
time in getting back to business; but I
believe the record for the endurance test
in that line belongs to a white woman.
Her case is a matter of cold history too.
She was the wife of a soldier, who was
in the retreat on Corunna. (A limited
•number of soldiers were allowed to take
their wives along with the regiment on
active service those days, and mighty
active they sometimes found it.) The
Corunna episode was one of
the hardest tasks that a Brit-
ish army ever tackled. Forced
marches were made day after
day over mountains and
streams, on terrible roads and
'in bitterly cold and wet
weather. The rear-guard con-
tinually had to staml off the
pursuing enemy while the
main body hobbled away.
Rations were so short that
thev w°re often invi°ibl°, ex-
cept through a microscope.
Strong, war-hardened me n
dropped out in hundreds from
sheer exhaustion, and perished
miserably. The woman I’m
speaking of had to give in
and drop, and her husband
stayed with her. The marching regiments were being
driven to the last ounce of their strength and speed,
and no one expected that the pair would ever over-
take the army again. But that night, when the
weary soldiers had flopped on the wet surface of
Spain, to snatch a few hours’ rest, the man and the
woman staggered into camp, taking turns in carry-
ing the new-born infant. Mother and child finished
the march to the sea and were safely embarked, and
the child grew up and lived to a good age. It is a
solid argument in favor of the theory that the-" is
no endurance test Color can stand up to that White
can’t see, and go ope better on.
“Nala-Nodelpats” : Will some Abo. versed
in the subject—no others need waste good space —-
explain something about Binghi’s smoke signals?
Three things I and several other people want to
know: (1) What is the longest distance a smoke
message has been sent; (2) how long does it take to
reach its final destination; (3) is it a fact that
black brother can send the signals against the wind?

“Wandewoi”: Nowadays on the North
Coast (N.S.W-) brick piers are generally used in-
stead of the old wood piles for house-building. This
is to give the .white apt something to break his molars
on. Also, a shallow Y-shaped trench is dug round
the site of the,house, and coarse salt is sown therein
to a depth of about an inch, and then covered over.
This plan has been received by the unanimous and
disgusted “Gorstruth!” of antdom.
“Jonnop” : The room I entered contained
two couches. On one was a man who had just handed
in his marble; on the other was his drunk and morbid
friend, bemoaning the loss of his pal. The ambu-
lance man decided that the corpse was a perfectly
dead and defunct cadaver, so we proceeded to the
morgue—a neighbor, the man in charge and myself
riding in the front of the waggon. As we neared
the deadhouse we suddenly remembered that we had
no death-certificate, so we steered towards the hos-
pital in order that a doctor might substantiate our
opinions as to the deceasedness of the cargo. Sud-
denly groans and tumblings were heard to issue
from the waggon. At a knock at the glass panelling
at our backs, the three of us turned our heads to see
a wild-eyed and bloated face pressed hard against
the window. The effect was immediate. The driver
uttered a terrified “My Gawd!” and started a sprint
along the horse’s spine. The neighbor dived over
one wheel. I fled over the other, and dashed to open
the back of the waggon. The explanation was
simple. The remains were still dead, but in the van
was the afore-mentioned drunk. He had stepped in
to have a last look at his pal, had fallen asleep,
and was locked in unnoticed.

“C.Q.” on a natural product: —
The ’Groper had just arrived out of the wilds in
time to attend the Williams (W.A.) race meeting,
and with the vast concourse of fully 50 people, who
had gathered for the sport, he started in to see life.
The Calcutta Sweep, following upon 27 rums, was
the climax. The ’Groper had never seen it before,
and having drawn a fairly good prad for the prin-
cipal item on the card, he was prompted to buy the
animal at the auction. After that he hit the rum tally
up a few, and slept partly across a fence and partly
across a cart-wheel. Next morning he had a few
nobblers for breakfast, and announced his intention
of “goin’ roun’ t’ ’ave a look at me ’orse.” Re-
turning, he declared it to be “a dirt-cheap ’orse orl-
right.” “Well, the odds ain’t too good,, y’ know,”
remarked Mr. Publican. “Garn, ’e’s a gift at three
ten. Let’s ’ave s’more drinks.”, By 11 o’clock the
’Groper couldn’t disentangle himself from the path
which connected bar and stable. No matter how
wide he tacked, the drift always took him back to
it. “Blarst ther races,” he cursed at last; “I’m goin’
out ’ome ter camo. W’ere’s me ’orse?” When he
was informed that Mallowago had gone out to the
course he became furious.) “Oo the ’ell tole anybudy
ter go interferin’ with my ’orse?” he bellowed, and
when no explanation was forthcoming, he rushed
for the course hatless, coatless and raving, and at-
tained his goal just as the big race was about to
start. What followed was mostly hidden in dust and
smothered in curses. Four horses bolted in different
directions, and bits of satin jackets floated up like
feathers from a bird museum Struck by dynamite.
The local cop and a visiting John D. from Narrogin
were early extricated from the debris and taken
away to bed. Mallowago’s owner was found half
strangled in the horse’s neck-rope, while on top of
a heap of wrecked humanity sat a much-damaged,
but still alive ’Groper, exclaiming, between tears and
curses, “I want me ’orse, or there won’t be no
blanky races.” And there wouldn’t have been, either,
if an expert rope-thrower hadn’t been bribed to
lassoo the ’Groper and secure him to an adjacent
gum. It took lhr. 20min. to get through that part
of the proceedings.
DUTTON’S GRAVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A whaling-station was established at Portland, Vic-
toria, by Captain William Dutton, in 1828, years
before either the Hentys or John Pascoe Fawkner
crossed over from Tasmania. Dutton was the first
native-born Australian to navigate a vessel from this
country to the Thames. His grave lies neglected
at Narrawong, on the shores of Portland Bay— Casual
newspaper item.
Who sings of Drake and Devon, of battle-drums of
Spain;
Of ships they sank in warfare upon the Spanish Main?
IV ell-woven are their ballads of Captains Gone
Below—
The strong corsairs of England, who sailed from
Plymouth Hoe!
Proud-chanted songs of Raleigh, whose cloak the
Virgin Queen
Trod underfoot in ancient days when swords had
edge and sheen!
In songs right-brave and royal Drake’s blades and
banners wave;
Where is Our Hero’s anthems—the Psalm of Dutton’s
Grave ?
For Drake wreathe bays and laurel—yea, all the
pirate crew
Who followed Drake
For England’s sake
Through all the storms that blew !
Give unto all his Captains their meed of singers’
praise,
Who chased the Don
In years agone
By all the western cays!
Be proud of these O Britain, if still thy strength
remain—
Thou owest them
Thy diadem
Upon the Spanish Main!
Here also rings an anthem —one storm-song of the
brave ;
Caught from the surge
On ocean’s verge,
It blooms o’er Dutton’s, Grave ! '
We have our Captains, England—sails of the native-
born
Topped raving seas when towards the Thames they
cleared the frozen Horn.
We have our Sons Courageous—thy last sea buc-
caneer
Perchance may come from ’neath the Cross when
ships for action clear!
When drums of Drake no longer have power to stir
thy heart,
Perchance this Land’s armadas shall guard thy
ocean-mart!
Drake sank with flashing sword-edge, last pillowed
’neath the wave;
I hear the croon of cordage o’er this storm-hallowed
grave !
He sleeps beside the Harbor—our Sea-Gate of the
South ;
This pioneer
Who was a seer,
And spake with bearded mouth!
He said: “Let men come after —my whaling days are
done ;
Yet shall this Bay
Hold seaward sway,
And hear the nooning gun !
Then shall its ships go bravely”—- Alas! few think
of thee,
Who found this gate
In ’2B—
Sleeper by the Sea !
From far Antarctic spaces, winds raking cliff and
cave,
By ocean’s hem
Sing requiem
O’er Captain Dutton’s Grave!
These are the years, O England, when prudent
Commerce steers ;
Thine Empire’s given over to fat land-buccaneers!
The Brave Man rules no longer—the Drakes and
Duttons all
Must yield their dreams of glory when sceptred
traders call!
Strange are thine Empire’s masters—in Britain and
the South,
Greed’s talons long and hungry have stopped the
statesman’s mouth !
Thou hadst thy Sons Courageous—behold! in last
conclave
Thine hucksters sit triumphant, and mock the hero’s
grave!
Yet.. .Songs of Drake and Devon, of battle drums of
Spain ;
Of shivs that sank,
In battle-rank
May stir thy soul again!
So weave thrice-splendid ballads of Captains Gone
Below —
The old corsairs
Whose ocean-lairs
Lie far from Plymouth Hoe!
Then chant good songs of Raleigh, and of the Virgin
Queen;
Brave men long mute —
They won the loot,
Their swords were long and keen!
In songs thrice brave and royal, let Drake’s red
banners wave;
Here in this Land
Some understand,
The tale of Dutton’s Grave!

“Montalex”: Concerning Randolph Bed-
ford’s vigorous cremation sermon (B. 7/9/’ll). De-
fenders of inhumation sometimes maintain that there
is no such thing as corruption, because the most dis-
gusting substances—like the most inoffensive—are
composed almost entirely of carbon, hydrogen, oxy-
gen and nitrogen. As well argue that wood and
sugar, which give the same qualitative analysis, are,
therefore, the same thing. And, anyhow, what our
senses say is corruption is the only corruption con-
ceivable. Again. I quote from a recent anti-crema-
tion pamphlet: “The human body is mainly com-
posed of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen, and
in the ease of (say) an list, man, the two last,
combined into water, represent 881 b. out of the total
1541 b. Now, decomposition is simply the setting
free of these constituents, so that they may re-
combine into other complex bodies.” No need to
tell us that; the word “decomposition” speaks for
itself. In fact, the offensiveness of decaying animal-
matter is principally due to the liberation of nitro-
gen. But why make this separative process a deadly
danger to people on the surface of the planet, b'v
allowing it to take place very slowly beneath that
surface? The constituents of a cremated body are
set free in a few hours ; those of an inhumed corpse
pollute the soil for many years.

“Towac”: The Free State Farmer’s
Weekly (2/8/’ll) printed the following:—-
A striking instance of red-tapeism in international
horse traffic under the British flag has just ben ex-
perienced by Mr. Thomas Learmonth, a well-known
Australian now staying in London. While travelling
in the East he bought the famous Arab stallion
Baladin, standing 15.1 hands high, with the object
of improving the breed in his native country. As
there is an embargo on Arab horses leaving the Otto-
man Empire, the animal was secretly sent from
Damascus to Cairo by camel train, a journey which
occupied 23 days. From Cairo it was conveyed by
train to Port Said, where it was shipped to Mr.
Learmonth’s agents at Melbourne. On arrival at
the latter port the authorities refused to allow the
animal to land, as it was of Asiatic origin, and only
with difficulty could they be prevailed upon to have
it placed in quarantine for five days, and then re-
shipped to Port Said by a French liner.
This story of the horrors of alien restriction legisla-
tion recalls the theft during the S’African war, by
a sergeant and a trooper of the Ist N.S.W. Backblox
Regiment, of the stallion chargers of Lord Roberts
and his aide Lord Stanley. The idea of the preda-
tory folk was to cross these animals with a bottle of-
Condy’s fluid and a pair of scissors, and so achieve,
haply, something approximating the Dutch steed.
The scheme was nipped in the bud, however, and its
formulators summarily hanged on a tree 385 ft. high.
European scientists took a good deal of interest in
the experiment at the time.

“Agricola”: Re “The Undertaker” (B.
14/9/Tl) and his remarks concerning the unwilling-
ness of writers and speakers to state that a dead
person is simply dead, without tying any flowers or
blue ribbon round the statement. The miner suffers
from the same reluctance to give it a name. Uncle
Dick Trevilian got caught while panelling out some
tricky ground, and after 10 days in the hospital he
gave it up as a bad job. His mates in the tunnel
variously informed me that Uncle Dick had “kicked
the bucket,” “chucked a seven,” “passed in his
alley,” “thrown in his taw,” “shut his fist,” “turned
up his toes,” “knocked,” “gone off shift,” “passed
out,” “snapped his hobbles,” “run a bye,” “heaved
the sponge,” “hit the long track,” “gone to the
Never Never,” “taken the count,” “slipped his
collar,” and ‘pegged out.” And local preacher
Tom Andrews reckoned that Uncle had “gone to his
reward.” Now, these fellows had fought and
struggled for the privilege of risking their lives in
getting Uncle Dick out from the fall, but not a man
of them seemed to find courage enough to say:
“Uncle Dick’s dead.”
There are at least three kinds of monopolies—

The Queensland Board of Advice on
prickly-pear destruction has made an interim report.
It examined the results of experiments of various
kinds, and considered 92 schemes submitted for the
complete destruction of the pest. The methods used
were classified as follows: (1) Destruction by
mechanical means—(a) by manual labor, stacking
and burning, for instance; (b) by some mechanical
device, e.g., rolling and ploughing-in. (2) Destruc-
tion by poisoning—(a) poison only ; (6) poisoning
and subsequent burning. (3) Control and destruc-
tion by (a) insect parasites; (6) specific disease.
(4) Destruction by utilisation—(o) as fodder; (6)
in other ways. Destruction by manual labor was
found to be efficacious on small holdings, but was
far too expensive when applied to large areas. Roll-
ing and ploughing-in the pear, and then cultivating
the land, gave satisfactory results when the opera-
tions could be performed over and over again ; other-
wise the method was a failure. Destruction by
poisoning, according to the information laid before
the Board, is the method likely to be the most
efficacious. Preparations containing arsenic kill the
anathema, provided they can be introduced into its
circulatory system, either by injection or by hacking
the curse, and then spraying it. Chemist Brunnich,
one of the Board, recommends a mixture of 101 b. of
arsenic, 41b. of caustic soda in the dry powdered
state, and enough cold water to make about eight
gallons of concentrate, as a suitable preparation for
injection. The addition of 100 gallons of water
makes a good solution for spraying. Burning should
follow poisoning. The appointment of a small com-
mission to visit other pear-infested countries, and
there inquire into the possibility of destruction by
insects, and the carrying out of experiments with
insect and disease agencies in a properly equipped
experimental station, are recommended. The Board
reckons that the prickles must be got rid of before
the porcupiny vegetable can be reckoned good fodder
and recommends the purchase of appliances for deal-
ing with this painful subject.
“L. Lou”: Observed a family of rabbits
spring-cleaning t’other day. The bucks mustered at
the front door. Then No. 1 stepped into the passage,
lifted the carpet and commenced to throw it behind
him. No. 2 stood behind No. 1, and flung the floor-
> covering a further stage. No. 3 seized and cast it
back to No. 4, who got a kick in the ribs from No.
5 for being a slow beginner. As No. 5 wired in,
No. 1, who had worked right through to the kitchen
door or pop hole, came round and took his place in
the rear again, and so the contract was in full
swing. After a while a halt was called, and all
hands adjourned to the surface for- a spell and a bit
of lunch. And while the men were on the roof,
each doe cleaned her own private apartment, swept
the dirt into the passage, and quietly closed the
door. I defy anyone to interfere with the above.
The ceremony is performed but once a year, and the
time is now over-ripe.
“Chloe: Whoever talked of cannibalism at
Sunday Islands was leg-pulling. As a matter of fact,
there is no cannibalism anywhere in Australia. I
was in Broome when Father Dominic—setat. 80-
left for a tour on foot, with no weapon but
a rosary and no other escort than one
native guide, through country which had been
described as “the most dangerous in Australia.”
Nothing happened to him. Old Coppin, of Yarrie
station, upper De Grey country, is a great authority
on the natives of N.W. and Central Australia. He
has lived amongst them for 50 years. He tells
pie that he has never heard of them practising canni-
balism. As to the Sunday Islands natives, they were
originally imported there about 10 years ago by a
young Englishman—a remittancer, of a livelv habit
of life. This youth, on taking up his residence at
the island, abandoned his festive ways abruptly, and
now rules as absolute sovereign over the 70 or 80
inhabitants of the place. They have never attempted
to digest him, or any of his friends. Though a staid
monarch, these days, he still retains his old habit of
limb-dragging—which probably accounts for these
wild yarns re man-eating in his kingdom or baili-
wick.
A SCRIPTURAL
POINT OF VIEW.
PARISHIONER: "I' ve been, paying mining calls
all my life, and have never struck a good thing yet."
SHEPHERD : “Many are called, deah friends , but few are chosen."
“Adelaide”: The old controversy over the
origin of the Adelaide hills has been switched off
on to the topic of the tracks made by a kangaroo.
The elderly Howchin, of Adelaide, says the hills
were formed by ice-action ; the younger Basedow, of
the same city, says they were not —-or, at any rate,
need not have been. While Basedow was up in the
Northern Territory as Protector of Aborigines, a
European scientist, Noetling, came along and agreed
with Howchin, and both poked borak at the other
fellow. The other fellow is now back again, and hitting
out. Noetling’s accuracy, he hints, may be judged
by his expressed opinion that certain fossil imprints
in the sandstone of Warrnambool (Vic.) were made
by the hindquarters of a squatting kangaroo ! Fur-
ther, Noetling has claimed, according to Basedow,
that a track looking unlike that of a ’roo may yet
be one, modified by “the peculiar habit these animals
have of following one behind the other, and always
jumping into the exact imprints left in the ground
by the leading kangaroo.” Basedow calls this “a
bush yarn.” Howchin passes that question, but, in a
reply a column long, throws mud at Basedow’s ac-
curacy, scientific attainments, University degree, and
everything that is his. The cheerful Billingsgate of
scientific men over an unprovable problem is only
excelled by the ditto of theologians over a problem
in their line of business.
“M.V.”: “Mallarapoonie” (B. 10/8/’ll)
asks if any Abo-liar can decide whether the flesh of
a poisoned animal is injurious to humans. I’ll put
a bit towards it. Have seen cattle, when short of
salt, eat phosphorised dried bunny carcase and die;
also saw wild pigs at Hungry Hall’s, Bogan River,
die from same cause. Again, have seen pigs
fatten on dog-baits of the strychnine variety. But
why not experiment and be sure? Wade will lend
you Willis.
“Mallee Cocky”: “Boswell” (B. 31/8/’ll)
goes astray. He says a body poisoned by strychnine
is permeated throughout, and becomes a larger bait
than the original. I have poisoned rabbits with
strychnine and fed the carcases to dogs, and never
have seen any symptoms of poisoning. Also, I know
of men, engaged in poisoning rabbits in the Mallee,
who ate the hindquarters of bunnies that had gone to
the heavenly burrow through strychnine. All the
men are still alive except one who perished through
old age, and one who was killed through sudden stop-
page of his beer.
“Flinderino”: Re an occasionally para-
graphed aboriginal art gallery that exists near the
Glenelg River district of North AVestralia. The
caves that contain these works of art were discovered
in 1837 by Captain Grey, who was in charge of an
exploring party sent out by the British Government.
The object of this expedition was to ascertain if there
were any large rivers existing in the north-west of
the Australian continent. On leaving England Grey
was instructed to land in the north of Westralia, and,
with the aid of Timor ponies, to proceed overland to
Perth, then known as the Swan River Settlement.
Twenty-six ponies were brought over in a schooner
from Timor, but, within a few days of landing in
Australia, 14 of the animals died. The expedition
was not a success. Soon after setting out Grey re-
ceived a severe spear wound, during a skirmish with
the blacks. However, the Glenelg River was dis-
covered, and named; and Grey also stumbled across
the above-mentioned caves. In his diary, Grey de-
cribes the crude paintings that were in the caves,
and states that one of the figures, that of a man,
clothed in a long red garment, was over 10ft. in
length. Another painting represented four heads
conjoined, each face with a totally different expres-
sion of countenance, but in every instance the mouth
was missing. One cave alone contained nearly 60
drawings. The human head carved on the sand-
stone rock is an exceptionally clever piece of work,
and shows that the blackfellow of long ago was a
painstaking artist. Grey said that this particular
item of sculpture was very ancient, as the edges of
the cutting were rounded and perfectly smooth —so
smooth that onlv Innn- exnosnre influ-
ences could account for their condition.

OMALLEY'S HAT.
The Home Affairs Department has Issued an order that
the clerks are nor to attend to callers until they remove
their hats. No gentleman requires to be reminded that
he should take his- hat off on entering an office. As a
democrat, i was always taught that when I went into any
man's place of business it was polite to take my hat off.
The same custom is expected in the Home Affairs Depart-
ment. We do not aspire to become a Chesterfieldlan
Department, but we think that we might presume that the
ordinary courtesies of life would be observed. So far as 1
am concerned I take my hat off even when I go Into a
bank .—Federal Minister O'Malley
IN thess Democr(h)atic days
We are altering our ways,
And we feel a mild amaze when we reflect
On the methods of our sires,
Who were Etiquette Defiers—
Why, one blushes and perspires at their neglect 1
They were solid democrats!
No one troubled about hats;
People’s hair was thick, like mats, to keep out rain;
Folk just roosted in the trees,
While the sun and kindly breeze
M ade their thatches, by degrees, quite dry again I
Even Kings of long ago
Had no use for a cAapeau.- ' i
If a gale began to blow they didn’t mind, Jk
For they had no ha,ts to lose!
Yes, no doubt they were Yahoos, -±|g|
But they’d hygienic views—of a kind!
The -er -ladies didn’t fret
' If the day was rather wet,
Even though their hearts were set on
meeting blokes;
They did not give way to grief
If the feathers, or the leaf
That they wore with costume brief
were sodden toques.
When the males had work to do
They just took a club or two,
Or a hammer, or an axe of diorite:
At the Home Department’s door,
Which was always closed at four,
They would stand and howl for gore until
the night)
Then the msgatherium,
And the elosaurs would come,
And the scene would fairly hum with cheerlu) "scraps -
Till the Office was a wreck,
And the Minister a speck
In the distance-half a neck ahead, perhaps i
The O’Malley oi that day
Would steal hastily away
While the staff were brought to bay by Sabre Tooth,
Who was Thirty Feet of Cat—
With an animal like that
No one waited for his Hat-and that’s the truth!

Died in Melbourne, last week, Dr. H.
Sydenham Lyons, who, when the big mining
accident happened at Creswick in 1882,
descended into the Hooded workings and
helped to rescue and patch the injured. Un-
like another doctor, however, he never had
the strange experience of watching some
stay-at-home Lyons taking his limelight and
accepting the credit for his heroism. The
doctor, though he died from pneumonia, had
never fully recovered from the paralysis
which followed on a buggy accident he fell
into while driving to see a patient 25 years
ago.
"Condot” writes something more about a
brick: —
Dennistoun Wood, the octogenarian Tory of Tas-
mania's House of Ass., lias been writing to the Aus-
tralasian, concerning the presentation of a brick
lrom John Mitchel’s cottage to John Redmond, a
reference to which was made in The Bulletin
i 4 / 9 /’! 1 )- Amon S other things he states that Mit-
chel, when he saw a chance of escape, withdrew his
parole in the presence of a magistrate, and imme-
diately rushed to the door and escaped on a fleet
horse. The Government of the day apparently did
not set much value upon Mitchel, as it advertised a
reward of 405., “or less if the Governor should think
ht, for information that would lead to his appre-
hension. This was too cheap, and Mitchel got awav.
Dennistoun Wood, who knew Mitchel personally, ac-
cuses him of having 1 publicly championed slavery and
defended Jewish disabilities, “much to the vexation
of his honest and consistent fellow-exile, John
Martin.” Really, it doesn’t matter much.
Reviewing the sales, completed and con-
templated, of the vast Cooper estates in and
around Sydney, a newspaper names the first
baronet Daniel Cooper as the founder of the
estate and its “nurse." As a matter of fact,
most of the suburban land and much of the
city property was acquired before the first
baronet was out of knickers. The Waterloo
Warehouse, at the corner of Market and
George streets, was built in 1820, and the
Waterloo and Woollalira suburbs were ac-
quired in that decade. The man who founded
the fortunes of the Coopers was Daniel of
that ilk, who came to Sydney in the first de-
cade of last century, lie died childless in
London in 1553, and left his lands, etc., to
his nephews—children of his brother Tom.
Infty-seven years of unearned increment,
since Dan’s death, have done wonders.
“Londoner” writes: —
Rev. Frederick Meyer, who, by the look of the
cables, is getting enough advertisement out of his op-
position to the Johnson-Wells scrap to keep his
bethel in Regent’s Park packed for the next 12
months, is one of England’s leading clerical pos-
turers. Father Vaughan, Booth, Meyer, that is about
the order of demerit. For vears, wherever Meyer
settled, whether in Liverpool, York, Leicester or
London, he wrote and blithered and argued till he
drew the limelight on himself. If it left him, he
grew peevish and uneasy, like a forgotten actress;
but his methods ensured that the trouble didn’t
occur often. It is all Australia to a “Liberal”
M.Ij.A. that Meyer s Anti-Stoush bellow-drama will
shortly be pinched by notoriety-lusting parsons on
this side. There is nothing easier than one of these
wild ‘campaigns” against drink, boxing, hugging-
in-the-moonlight, or what not (cheek and a loose
tongue being the only real essentials) ; and they
bring m the thrippences in handfuls.
Sir Genille Cave-Brown-Cave, the “Cow-
boy baronet,” has been promoted to the rank
of ensign in the army—the Salvation one.
Hitherto, he has been performing such menial
duties as floor-scrubbing, banging the bass
drum and distributing hymn books. Since
his promotion he “leads the service of prayer,
thanksgiving and experience.” His personal
testimony is that, while he was one day
drinking at a bar, a Salvation lassie ap-
proached and invited him to accompany her
to the barracks. Not having heard a kind
word for ever so long, he surrendered, and
soon found himself a greatly reformed char-
acter. Now, he says, he is “rich in grace ”
and earthly treasures “allure him no longer’”
He furthermore declares that he would rather
be caretaker of a Salvationist barracks than
follow the hounds and be a leader of English
society after the fashion of his ancestors.
Dr. J. W. Y k Fishbourne, the pleasant
mannered and skilful medico of Melbourne,
who was taken away by cerebral hemorrhage
the other day, was one of the best-known
lunacy specialists in Australia. He was
among the first advocates of the colony
treatment of epileptics, and was always
busying himself trying to get better pro-
vision for that class of sufferer. He also
established the first home in Australia for
the care and education of the mentally feeble.
Chicago newspapers relate how Austra-
lia’s old, fluent friend, “Overseer” Wilbur
Glenn Voliva, upon whom fell the mantle of
Elijah Dowie, has distinguished himself by
consecrating 286 infants in Shiloh Taber-
nacle. The consecration was effected by
Voliva kissing the kids, and he got through
the job in the record time of 48 minutes.
Incidentally, 27,5(J0d015. were thrown into a
barrel as an offering from parents and others,
and it is understood that Wilbur Glenn
hurried through the preliminaries in order
to count the change.
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
The late James Rutherford was not the founder of
Cobb and Co. in Australia. Cobb was a Yankee,
who came to Melbourne in 1851 or ’52, saw that
coaching had never been understood hereabouts,
went back to the States, and returned with sample
coaches, built on the leather-spring principle. It is
generally understood that at least three of the mem-
bers of the N.S.W. firm of Cobb and Co. were
“whips” for the original Cobb. Cobb crossed the
Murray, and ran the Riverina coaching business as
Robertson, Wagner and Co. Rutherford, Frank
Whitney, Walter Hall and W. B. Bradly had
western N.S.W. and Queensland as their field, with
Bathurst as headquarters. As railways extended
Cobb and Co. had to push out. Bradly died, Whit-
ney sold out, and Walter Hall followed, leaving
Rutherford the skeleton. Walter Hall, nowadays the
immensely wealthy Mount Morganaire, is the survivor
of the partnership. In 1875 Cobb’s office was in
Pitt-street. where Garling’s Chambers are now —
“Walter R. Hall, manager.” Next door the late
Tom S. Clibborn and Fennelly had livery stables.
The tale of an underground engineei ;
The N.S.W. “Liberals,” who in these days haunt
a cellar in Pitt-street, used 25 years ago to collogue
in a big tobacconist’s shop in King-street. The shop
was kept by James Eve, who was supposed to be a
successful underground engineer—like Tom Slattery
on the other side. Eve at last decided to go into
Parliament himself, and ran for Canterbury, which
then returned four members. It was the first big
outbreak of the Labor party. Joe Carruthers got
into the first place easily, with Laborites Bavister
and Danahey second and third; but for the fourth
there was a great fi dit between Eve and the Yellow
Pup, represented by John Wheeler. On the count,
Wheeler was two votes ahead; but, on petition, the
Pup was shooed off the mat, and Eve got the seat.
In the House, however, he made no mark worth
mentioning, and disappeared at the next election.
After that nothing was heard of his engineering
skill, and he passed out of notice. He died, a for-
gotten ancient of 74, at Mosman, last week.
The Bent Memorial Committee, having
laboriously raked together £5OO for a' me-
mento of the departed Victorian statesman,
has decided on a 9ft. bronze statue, sur-
mounting a pedestal of Harcourt granite
12ft. high. All this for £5OO. It reminds
one of Christopher Wren’s gibe at the com-
mittee that wanted to “amend” his plans of
St. Paul’s—“wouldn’t they spring another
80s. and have a nice weathercock on top?”
Miss Baskerville, of Brighton, is to hew out
as much of the figure of the late Thomas
Adolphus as it may be thought prudent to
convey to future generations.

“Adenoid”: The late “Jack” Gillies,
M.L.A. (of N.S.W".), was the “local mem-
ber” pure and simple. He would cheerfuly
make a special trip to Sydney to get a tele-
graph boy a few shillings overtime, and he
did service for constituents of all classes,
parties and creeds whether Parliament was
in or out of session. During the election of
189 S, when the country was fairly sizzling
over the Federation question, Gillies was
asked his view of the matter. “Tell me what
Federation is going to do for Maitland,” he
said cheerfully, “and I’ll answer you.” When
Reid, in 1893, expected to put out Dibbs and
repeal the ad valorem duties, he sounded
Gillies as to his attitude. It was more a
matter of form than anything else, Gillies
being notoriously opposed to the duties. But
some one had been there first. “Give me the
Long Bridge at Maitland and I’m with
you,” said Gillies. Reid lost by two votes,
and Maitland go. the bridge.
Bowes Kelly, the rufous giant who is
chairman of Mount Lyell, and spokesman
for the Board in its row with the miners, is
nowadays the most notable of the men who
used to be known as “the Queen-street
push.” Kelly (with his brothers) was some-
thing in a very small way in the Far
Western (N.S.W.) squatting profession
when Broken Hill was found; and the
squatters and their jackeroos, led by George
McCulloch, had the biggest cut out of that.
A few of them, like the Broadribbs, splashed
uo their hundreds of thousands; but Bowes
Kelly kept his shoulder to the grindstone, and
his nose to the wheel, and, when William
Orr showed the same crowd the wav to
Mount Lyell, Bowes Kelly got there
nromntly. He has had a sharp nose and a
long-distance smell for the solid things.
Though he didn’t have as good a start "as
some of the old Broken Hill crowd, he would
probably cut up more solidly now than any
of his former mates.
JACK VERRAN, S.A. PREMIER.
Returning to Australia, aboard the Mol-
davia, is Captain Oswald Watt, of one of
those bare-legged Scottish regiments whose
doom has been sealed by the Universal Ser-
vice movement. He holds an aviator’s certi-
ficate (the first achieved by any officer in
these parts), and London Standard spoke
of him last month as “a daring and skilful
flier.” He has applied in advance for a
commission in the future Australian Aerial
Corps—an unusual ambition in a young Aus-
tralian with a large income, a house m
Berkeley Square, London, and other things
to make life worth living.
The auctioneer’s hammer is to waggle over
Varroville, a somewhat historic spot at
Minto, near Campbelltown (N.S.W.). Ori-
ginally a grant of 1900 acres to Dr. Townson,
a portion of it, 50 years ago, was the stud
farm of the late Justice Cheeke, where he
bred Clove, winner of the first A.J.C. Derby
in 1865. After his elevation to the Bench of
the Supreme Court, the Judge continued to
race, but always in the name of his trainer,
Chaffe. John Tait and his Honor were in
partnership in certain racing matters, and
he also had an interest in sheep farming with
the late Edward Broadhurst, Q.C. Mac-
quarie named Campbelltown after his wife’s
family, and Minto after a Scotch estate wfitli
which his own people had some connection.
Died, last week, at Cronulla (N.S.W.),
“Larry” Harnett, aged 69, who for 38 years
was Sergeant-at-Arms of the New South
Wales Assembly and the most numerous re-
citer of "Banjo” Paterson’s "Man from
Snowy River.” He would elocute snatches
of the verses into the ear upon which he
was about to land an obstreperous meipber
with the same pleasant intonation that
reached the hearing-apparatus of the Par-
liamentary picnicker after the coffee had
been handed round. In fact, if he had been
appointed Sergeant of Elocution in the As-
sembly he would probably have made as
many friends as he did as Sergeant Pass-
’Em-Out. He certainly could not have made
any more unless the number of constitu-
encies had been increased. About three
years ago ill-health drove the genial officer
into retirement, and now it has driven him
to a still more peaceful place.
“Hogg”: Many Sydneyites will be sur-
prised to learn that the Earl of Belmore,
who was Governor of N.S.W. away back in
the ’6o’s, is still on this side of the Styx.
He and the Countess held ground and lofty
jinks on August 22, by way of celebrating
the golden jubilee of their wedding. They
were wedded in 1861. The Earl is now-76,
and the heir to the peerage is a native of
Sydney, and a barrister —a briefless one.
Altogether the Earl and Countess have pre-
sented the State with a baker’s dozen of
chddren. Nine of the 13 are daughters, only
one of whom is married. Ladv Belmore is
a niece of W. E. Gladstone. Lord Nelson,
who took his seat in 1845, is the father of
the House of Lords, but Belmore is next to
him in seniority, having been elected an
Irish representative peer in 1857. Although
the Corrys are “black Prodistans” as a
family, one cousin of Lord Belmore has
bolted away to Rome. He is the Rev
Gerald Corry, of the Brompton Oratory’
London.
7, Ut r h . -^ ustra lia’s one State pensioner, ex-
Judge -boucaut (who receives £l4OO a year),
passes his 80th milestone this month. He
sat on the Supreme Court Bench for 27
years, and before that was Premier on
several occasions. On December 9it will be
just DO years since he was first returned to

that Parliament being H. B. T. Strangwavs

JL)r. lv. 1 Muir, a good sportsman, formerly
Master of Hounds, and latterly chairman of
the Hunt Club committee. He imported the

and every rider went into mourning, to the
extent of a black armband.
“Henry Horsecollar”: So someone has
blown too hard on frail Lord Northcote,
once Governor-General of Australia, and lie
has fallen dow*n at the age of 65.
He was a most popular man in Australia,
partly because or his personal qualities,
hut mainly because he took local "society’'
seriously. Other Excellencies have achieved
public approval the same way. As a set-of
an Excellency departed, not long since, amid
muffled execrations because he looked at
"society” with his tongue in his cheek and a
wink in his other eye. And when a man
puts his tongue in his left cheek and wears
his wink in his right eye, tne distortion is
visible from every point of view except the
rear one. It is like a city set upon a hill
and cannot be hidden.
This is the way the Sydney Telegraph—
which continually hoots at Henry Willis,
Speaker of the N. S. Wales Assembly, for
his alleged unfairness- —puts it: —
At the conclusion of Mr. Crawford’s address Mr.
Wood rose to speak, but was ordered out, and Mr.
Fitzpatrick continued the debate.
And this is the way the official “Votes and
Proceedings” of the House sets it out:—
Disorder: —'the Honorable Member for Bega, Mr.
Wood, referring to remarks of the Member who had
last spoken, Mr. Speaker intimated that the Honor-
able Member must address the Chair, and either pro-
ceed with his speech or resume his seat. And Mr.
Wood, inquiring of Mr. Speaker what he meant by
“address the Chair,” Mr. Speaker ordered the Hon-
orable Member to resume his seat. And the Honor-
able Member intimating his desire to address the
Chair, Mr. Speaker again directed him to resume
his seat, and called the Honorable Member for
Orange. And Mr. Wood, still insisting on his right
to address the House, although ordered to resume
his seat, the Honorable Member was removed from
the Chamber by the Sergeant-at-Arms.
Which shows that condensation is mightier
than the truth.

“Geofred”: Eleven blocks of land were

(N.S.W.) for selection under Homestead
Lease conditions. There were 1332 appli-
cations, an average of 121 applicants per
block. And Wade said: “No man will think
of taking up land under these cruel lease-
hold conditions.” (Roof blown off with

H. M. COLLECTOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of late years the collecting of stamps has become
a very popular hobby. The leader of the fasnion
is his Majesty the King, who is an enthusiastic
collector. —Daily Driveller.
When dawns the long, long royal day,
With all its endless, racking toil,
Our Sovereign helps us on our way
With much hard work and elbow-oil.
At eventide, the palace lamps
Shine on his Gracious, sorting stamps.
When England’s loyal millions let
Their sweated Sovereign off the chain,
This is the game he’s at, to get
His wearied muscles right again—
With all the vim in life he clamps
His mits on great big books of stamps.
Yet every night and morning he
Must bed and board with grim unrest.
Glad, that this here philately
Can still the gnawing in his breast!
What keeps his soul from getting cramps
Through long, tired days ? His pretty stamps !
Though knives and guns and cannon call
Continually upon the crowned;
Though kings go up in smoke, and fall
In royal fragments all around,
No dread of dissolution damps
His ardor for unusual stamps.

That’s rather a muddle; but it can’t be helped.
Things will have to be explained this way. In 1902
the society, feeling a little better, arranged to pay its
old creditors 3 p.c. as a regular thing and 2 p.c. extra
out of profits, and in 1909 and 1910 the 2 p.c. extra
was paid. The old loans were represented mostly by
foreclosed properties, but as these properties im-
proved in value they were sold, and old debt was
paid off. In 1902 advances (mostly money due on
time-payment sales) and foreclosures totalled
£448,086; by 1910 they had been reduced to
£125,588. And the total liabilities had been shorn
down from £318,977 to £58,131. The old debt
carried 5 p.c. under the 1902 arrangement; and as
a good deal of the capital was still intact,
and therefore available for the protection of
creditors, it was plain that 5 p.c. was too
much to pay for the accommodation. Arrange-
ments were, therefore, made to pay off the balance
of the old debt. As a preliminary, however, a re-
valuation of assets had been made and various items
had been written down, as shown in the table above.
Then, to clear up the accounts, capital was written
down—written down, in fact, £20,000 more than
the valuation said was absolutely necessary. This
£20,000 consequently appears as a reserve, avail-
able for the further writing down of assets, if neces-
sary. As the total of the assets is now only
£153,437, and as they have been apparently written
down severely, and as properties in possession are
now less than £17,000, this provision for possible
further depreciation looks like an excess of caution.
Still, you don’t destroy property by merely writing
down its value in your books, so this co. is just as
well off if it calls something reserves as it would
be if it called the thing capital. Having had a
cleaning-up, and the sales of properties having more
than supported the recent valuation, the directors
take a long breath and recommend the first dividend
for close on 20 years. Not a big div. ; only 3J p.c.
And the co. will have to either get a bigger new
business or cut down its exes, before it can pay very
much more. This is partly due to the fact that of
the co.’s reduced capital of £96,605 no less than
£50,000 is represented by office premises (written
down from £78,000) ; and the net return shown by
that asset is under 5 p.c. The old shares were £5;
they have been written down to £2 10s.

This society has two classes of shares, ordinary and
terminating; the latter are guaranteed a fixed 5 p.c.
In addition to this pref. capital, which doesn’t
amount to much, there are deposits and other debts
totalling £46,339 ; and as all this money is out on
loan, the ordinary capital has to take some risks for
its 7 p.c. Under the circumstances ordinary share-
holders ought to view the pretty rapid growth of re-
serves with much satisfaction, and they ought to set
their faces against any increased div. until the re-
serves have grown much more. The society has been
making good progress:—

Other assets .. .. 322 196 105 121
But, as before suggested, good progress means bigger
risks for ordinary shareholders, who are really the
guarantors for the-whole thing; and the only guar-
antee they can have is the reserve fund, upon which
they are therefore cordially recommended to nail
both eyes.

In 1904 this society still had £42,128 of old boom
properties on its hands ; and to hurry the process of
cleaning-up a revaluation was decided upon. The
£42,128 was thus written down to £26,500, and
that meant writing down capital. While they were
about it the directors did the thing well, and, as re-
marked above, the £42,640 of capital was reduced
to £17,056, two £1 shares being issued in place of
each old five-pounder. Things in Melbourne imnroved
after 1904, and when properties have been sold they
have been fetching a ( trifle more than their written-
down value. These surpluses have gone to a con-
tingency reserve; and the total proceeds have been
put into advances. The various items have moved
like this: —
1905. 1909. 1910. 1911.
Liabilities .. £5,823 £4,278 £4,204 £4,733
Advances .. 5,402 12,954 14,195 17,704
Properties .. 19,995 13,513 13,063 11,858
Other Assets .. 645 1,081 910 154
Considering the times, properties have not been
moving off very fast; seeing that they bring in over
74 p.c. oil the average, the society is probably not
pushing their sale. Still, in spite of that advantage,
the concern is too small nowadays to be run economi-
cally, and, as suggested after previous post-mortems,
the most sensible thing would be to amalgamate
with some other concern in the same boat. *

As usual, there are investing and borrowing share-
holders —really people who put up the money, and
other people who borrow it and repay by instalments
—and after the usual dividend or interest is credited
to the investing shareholders, a bonus is added in
which both investors and borrowers share. The
amount of this bonus is lumped; moreover, it is
payable only on the maturity of the shares. In these
circumstances the rate of dividend can only be stated
approximately, and the total has to include the
amount paid or to be paid to borrowers. Other

Business is thus looking up: there are not many
places in Australia where the old type of building
society can show such figures. The deposits and
other debts are just about 2j times greater than the
capital, and that looks like taking risks; but the
risk isn’t as great as it looks, by reason of the un-
usually solid reserves which stand behind the capital.
From the national point of view it’s a pity building
society rules and other literature are not in as many
houses as they were a few years ago. Those docu-
ments, by showing the power of compound interest,
might have been of great value in hammering home
the possibilities of a sinking fund for getting the
country out of pawn. This society’s tables, for in-
stance, show that £35 17s. lOd. paid in now will
entitle the payer to a £lOO withdrawable share
in 21 years. And, as mentioned already, the society,
by paying a bonus, announces that it can do better
even than that: this year’s bonus, for instance, is
10s., payable on the maturity of the share.

The Mutual Life Insurance Co. of
New York. —This colossal American concern, which
is still doing new business in a small way in Aus-
tralia, had £1,669,522 of assurance in force in the
Commonwealth, according to the last Official Year
Book. Measured up by the amount of the Australian
policies, it ranks next after the City Mutual. The
American insurance troubles of six or seven years
ago gave it a healthy check. Up to that time, in
common with other Yankee offices, it had been
struggling after huge figures. In 1903 its new pre-
mium income was £2,362,285, and the expense rate
was a wild and woolly £2O 14s. sd. p.c. of total
income. The law stepped in just there, and rec-
koned that the agent was getting too much, where-
fore the widow and orphan would get too little; so
restrictions were put upon the quantity of new busi-
ness to be taken, as well as upon the expense rate.
Things have been improving ever since. The pre-
miums, certainly, are not what they were; in 1903
they totalled £11,618,074; last year they were
£11,052,323, and they had been much under that
in the interval. The new-premium income is not
stated separately these days, no doubt because it
shrank so much after the American insurance clean-
up. Nor are the policy surrenders shown separately
these days, and that also is probably due to the fact
that they have increased enormously, the result of
over-insurance in the days when the Yankee offices
were practically buying business. Yet the things
which this office evidently believes it bad business
to mention, are mostly in favor of the insurer.
Thus, the new-business shrinkage means a great
saving in exes. In 1903, when new business was
booming, total expenses were £2O 14s. sd. p.c. of
total income; for last year the rate was £ll 10s.
6d. p.c., including taxes. A saving of 9 p.c. on the
present income means an additional £1,491,090
available for swelling policy-holders’ bonuses. As a
result, total bonus distributions have increased
threefold in the past five years. The amount to be
divided this year is £2,780,151, or 25.1 p.c. of the
premiums paid. But this does not mean that all
policies will get 25.1 p.«. A very large number of
the policies formerly issued by American offices were
on the deferred bonus plan, and only those policies
which end their bonus period this year will draw
anything; they will take a big bite out of the
£2,780,151. For this reason a comparison between
Australian and American bonus figures is not worth
making.

This has been a sad business. The enthusiasts
who established the stores thought, like other boom-
sters, that it was only necessary to borrow money
in order to get rich; they overlooked the painful
fact that it is as easy to lose other people’s money
as your own—and easier in most cases. The co.
only had enough capital to furnish itself with a
respectable amount of stock; yet it put about
£30,000 into land and buildings in Flinders-street,
and another £20,000 into premises elsewhere, and
another £5OOO odd into furniture and fittings, and
various amounts into branches all over the country.
This, of course, meant that it couldn’t put as much
into stock anywhere as it should have done; also, it
couldn’t pay the cash and get the discounts that it
should have got; and, further, besides trade debts,
it had to hump mortgages, etc., of about £35,000.
Very soon it found that, having in bricks and mortar
the capital which it should have had in stock, it
couldn’t command its shareholders’ custom; yet, in
desperation, it had to compel them either to co-oper-
ate or go out—to buy £l2 worth of goods per
annum, or be fined £l, the £t being recovered
from their subscriptions. And, finallv, to pass over
other mistakes, it found that the premises on which
it had spent so much of its own money, and so much
of other people’s, were unsuitable, and it is pro-
posed to sell them. Already some land has been sold
at a profit of £315; but, as another investment
involved a loss of £297, there is only £lB to add
to the profits of the past half-year, In the co.’s
accounts this amount has been put to the credit of
a Property Realisation Fund. If the Flinders-
street property, which stands in the books at about
£28,000, can be got rid of on satisfactory terms,
the co. will still have quite enough debt and other
trouble on its hands; for it put about £21,000 into
a bakery and stables, and though, for the first time,
this branqh now shows a small working profit, after
paying interest, the past record and present narrow-
margin shouldn’t allow the directors to reßt until
the book-value has been severely written down. That
writing down can only be done out of profits or
forfeited capital. And if profits are written off, they
can’t of course bo distributed. Instead, however,
of telling shareholders that the only certain way to
build up a secure and profitable business is to allow
profits to accumulate, so that Stock may be increased
and contingencies provided for, the directors talk
of resuming dividends, though they haven’t got a
penny to reserve, except a small remnant of the for-
feited capital. It almost makes one despair that the
co. will ever be put on a firm basis under present
management.

The whole thing wants re-organising. The accounts
are presented in a stupid way, for which there is no
justification at all except that they were probably
presented like that by the philanthropic but unbusi-
nesslike people who founded the co-operative move-
ment. As a result, the last line in the table is to
a great extent mere guesswork—-and so it always is.
The “committee”—it Wouldn’t call itself a Board on
any account —doesn’t, in Its report, recommend any
particular dividend or bonus. The “members”—
they mustn’t be called “shareholders”—‘meet, have
a quantity of figures thrown at them, and offhand
are asked to adopt a dividend and bonus at such and
such rate, though they haven’t got the ghost of an
idea what amount will thereby be absorbed. (The
dividend to shareholders, by the way, is “interest” ;
you mustn’t call it “dividend.” The “dividend” is
the bonus the purchasers get.) Worse still, the capi-
tal may be withdrawn at any time upon the briefest
of notice ; and only an amazing lot of luck will keep
a concern, organised on that basis, from having to
close its doors some day. For instance, this co. (of
course, it can’t use plain English, but must call
itself a “society”) has £84,078 of “capital,” and
£15,122 of “loans,” both lots withdrawable on
short notice; total, £99,200. Its cash and deposits
amount to only £10,734; its more or less liquid
assets to £13,292; total, £24,026. So people have
a right to drop in and collect £99,200 within a few
days, and the society has £24,026 to pay them with.
The balance of the £99,200 is represented by stock ;
and the concern that tries to dispose of stock in order
to satisfy a creditor who is waiting on the door-
mat, will be usually met with an offer of 10s. or so
in the £. The concern, no doubt, is thoroughly
sound, with some thousands to the good, and a valu-
able connection; but it is tempting trouble. The
constitution being what it is, the concern doesn’t
attract the commercial man; consequently, every
now and then the “committee” wakes up to find that
some department has got into a mess. That has just
happened again; and coming on top of the carters’
strike, etc., the half-year’s profits have been knocked
endways, and the not very fat bonus has been pulled
down again.

This little concern used to be the People’s Prudential
Benefit Society, Ltd., and the old name was better
than the new one. It does some straight-out life
assurance certainly, all or nearly all of it in-
dustrial, but it goes off into all sorts of
side-tracks; and most of the “claims” are really
payments made to doctors and chemists. It is dear
insurance; as the foregoing table shows, more money
went last year in expenses than in claims. Most of
the benefits it confers could, no doubt, be got at a
lower cost from the best co-operative friendly -td-
cieties; nevertheless, there are people who have to
be worried into joining any thrift association, and
this co. does the worrying, and that worrying inevit-
ably costs money. The expense rate, in proportion
to total revenue, has latterly been as follows:
1904.. £49 16 6 percent.
1905.. 50 14 9
1906.. 47 18 0 ~
1907.. 46 9 9
1908.. £45 9 8 percent.
1909.. 44 18 4 „
1910.. 43 2 2 „
1911.. 42 10 2 „
Expenses include dividends, which for last year were
at the rate of 6 p.c. on the paid capital of £9973.
It is impossible to express an opinion regarding the
assurance reserves or their adequacy; but the lia-
bility under policies is probably not heavy, and,
anyhow, policy-holders have the added protection of
the share capital; so they are most likely quite safe.
The funds are mainly in Government securities
( £10,104), mortgages ( £15,128) and loans on
policies ( £5820).

The div. of 14$ p.c. looks very corpulent; but it isn’t
what it looks. The co. was formed in the early days
of Melbourne’s Great Drunk, and 130,075 shares
were issued, paid to 19s. The premises were valued
at £151,083, and the furniture, etc., at another
£29,210. In spite of its big capital, the co., there-
fore, had to lean heavily on a mortgagee. Then
came the breakage of the boom, and with a towel
round its aching head this co. called in valuators,
who (probably with towels round their heads)
moaned that the place was worth only £65,000; so
a solid £86,083 was written off the freehold, and
£17,866 off the furniture, etc. As the mortgage
( £68,000) couldn’t be reduced in this fashion, the
capital had to be written down from 19s. to 2s. pei
share; and lid. per share was called up, making 2s.
lid. On the old boom investment the 141 p.c. is.
therefore, equal to only about 1J p.c. During thf
past few years very fair progress has been madt
with the reduction of the debt. This shows ill

That indicates an improvement of £13,136 in 10
years, and meantime a few thousands have been spent
in small additions and in numerous replacements,
Which probably more than counterbalance the wear
and tear. The mortgage now is down to £43,250,
and every little bit knocked off reduces the interest
bill, and makes it easier to knock off other little
bits. Later on, in the dim distance, when the whole
plaster has gone, there will be a valuable property
owned by a co. With a capital of only £13,493 ; and
the position will be very pleasant indeed. In fact,
it is cheerful even now.

account has shown these credits: —-

Jan., 1909.. 4575 July, 1911.. 5815
By comparing trading and net profits, it will be seen
that £2342 has been written off during the past
half-year; a great part of that has, however, been
spent on current repairs and renewals. Assuming
that the directors are making just a fair provision
for renewals, etc., then it is plain that the increase
of the div. to 12 p.c. Was not justified, inasmuch as
it has only been paid By drawing on reserves. The
cash position is certainly strong (deposits and cash
alone are £16,989 in excess of liabilities) ; but that
doesn’t justify a dividend in excess of the net earn-
ings, especially in times of unusual prosperity, when
the policy should be rather to strengthen the posi-
tion by way of preparing for the gloomier days
ahead.

This co. recently bought the Charters Towers Elec-
tric Light Co.’s undertaking for £6500, and bor-
rowed just upon £5OOO from the bank to pay for it.
The debt and the advantage of holding good coal re-
serves in these times of industrial trouble, led the
Board to prudently recommend that still another
div. should be passed. The overdraft had been
worked down to £4044 as at June 30, and generally
the directors seem to be shaping the right course.
Whether the Charters Towers mines will back up
the directors, and give the co. a long run for its
money, is a matter for the prophets ; arid this paper
isn’t in that business.
* * * *
The Australian Drug Co., Ltd. (Syd-
ney).—This co. was reconstructed last year to extend
an old-established Sydney business. The share capi-
tal had been only £lO,OOO ; for the rest the business
was financed mainly on debentures and an overdraft,
and in the end the debentures and the overdraft
looked like a rhinoceros astride a terrier. That
dexterous money-spinner, Adam Forsyth, undertook
to make both the rhinoceros and the hound more
comfortable, and 65,000 shares were issued at par.
They were put off privately, under an arrangement
that any brokerage saved should go to the credit of
the co. There was £4861 of this money to be paid
by the vendors ; added to the reserves, this brought
the latter up to £9235. The year’s profit, after
paying interest, was £4816. Although the new shares
were issued only in May, they ranked equally with
old shares for dividend to the end of June. The 5
p.c. that was declared absorbed £3750, leaving
£1066 to add to reserves, making the total £10,301.
This, however, hardly suggests the prospects under
the new conditions, seeing that until the new capital
cairie in late in the year the co. was paying interest
on a big swag of debt. The total bill for the debt
since paid off was £2484. Add that to the year’s
profit; total £7300, or 9J p.c. on capital. Probably
the new capital has also allowed of an extension of
business; if so, it would put something on
to that 9J p.c. The business hasn’t been run-
ning long enough under its new conditions to allow
one to form much of an opinion about its prospects;
but there is plenty of evidence that the wholesale
drug trade is full of profit, and the management is
in the hands of men who seem to dodge success with
great difficulty.

The Co-operative Box Co. of N. S.
Wales.—Something over 12 months ago most of the
butter-box makers of N.S.W. put a get-rich-quick plank
in their platform; and the cow farmers, who mostly
, voted a while ago against the Commonwealth con-
trol of monopolies, soon began to find out what that
meant. Prices moved up from the neighborhood of
Is. per box to the vicinity of 2s. The butter fac-
tories considered the law in restraint of trade, and
decided that there wasn’t much hope that way; for
the usual thing had happened—the monopolist had
keep just ahead of the law. In this case he had
formed a co. to buy the output of the various fac-
tories ; and there was, apparently, nothing illegal in
that. As prices didn’t come down to suit the butter
factories, various of them decided to make themselves
independent ‘by forming a co-operative co.; and
these few baptismal remarks are the result. The
little co. has a paid capital of £7686, and iQ nine
months its turnover has been £41,015. For a start
it had to plug against many obstacles; and that and
various preliminary exes, .account for a loss of £248
on the nirie months’ trading. To carry on the busi-
ness successfully a pretty large stock of timber, etc.,
has to be kept; and plant, premises, etc., have cost
nearly twice the amoriftt jpf the capital. The result
in an overdraft of £15,752. A very wise proposal
is, therefore, made to get in more capital; and if
the butter factories don’t want their toes squeezed,
they will provide it. On a moderate estimate they
have saved £3500 in the nine months by going in
for this co-operative supply business; ” and if the
thing were to fall through now for lack of capital,
they would nrobablv find themselves required to
make good that £3500, .which no doubt Private
Enterprise reckons it has been wickedly done out of.

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in
transmission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller
Bearings save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent,
of oil, so one of the first duties is naturally for
engineers to direct their special attention to these
bearings and to car boxes for trucks. Hyatts are
in continuous use in Cement Works, Ore Dressing
Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bushings o\
flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further
details, they can apply to the Australian Agents,

that 100 square feet of pipe covered with this

The Bigelow Patent Rock Breaker commends
itself to mine managers who welcome an effective
machine which is cheaper to maintain and repair
than Gyratory and other crushers. This machine is
of the well-known Blake type, but has some ad-
ditional improvements which have justified in prac-
tice all the claims advanced by the patentee. The
work of crushing is done on the down-stroke of the
pitman instead of the up-stroke; there is no strain
on the pitman cap; two large side rods resist the
thrust of the toggles, and enable the jaws to be
regulated within a large range; the back toggle is
so made as to resist all legitimate strains of crush-
ing, but will shear under exceptional conditions and
save the machine. The shaft and eccentric bearings
are self-lubricating; the jaws are convex and con-
cave, and with the cheek plates are made of steel
and are reversible. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have installed a great
number of these machines, and hold the sole manu-
facturing rights for the Commonwealth.* [3

Re John Bridge and Co., Ltd. (Sydney),
wool and produce brokers (B. 6/7/’ll). Some
further particulars are available concerning this co.
Being a private co. until 1910, accounts were not
forthcoming • prior to that date; but audited figures
have now been made available. Exception was taken
to the fact that so large a dividend as 20 p.c. was
paid Oh ordinary shares for the past year, seeing
that, with the pref. dividend, it absorbed all but
£1965 of the year’s profits, notwithstanding that
there were very small visible reserves apart from the
£29,660 Of premium capital. Previous accounts
show, however, that very large sums had been
written off. As at, March, 1901, the reserves were
£22,967. With that as a datum point, the fol-
lowing results show up in the ensuing 10 years:—
Reserves ~ .. .. ..£22,967
Profits earned .. .. .. .. 105,736
Total available .. .. £128,703
Appropriations :
Pref. dividends . . . . . . £ll,BBO
Ordinary dividends . . .. . . 37,133
Goodwill written off .. . . . . 40,000
Freeholds written down . . . . 11,000
Leaseholds written down . . . . 12,500
Other assets written down . . .. 12,123
Total appropriations . . . £124,636
Thus, of £105,736, the profits in 10 years, share-
holders took only £49,013, leaving £56,723 to
strengthen the business, by wiping out all paper
assets and reducing all book values to or below
market values. The large proportion of profits
divided last year was, therefore, more excusable than
appeared without a knowledge of the previous
history of the co. ; and that was the one point on
which the accou its were open to adverse criticism.

B. H. Block 14 is going to have one more
boring campaign, to try to find sulphides below the
600 ft. level. So far, over £BOOO has been spent
in drilling, but nothing has been found, and if the
proposed bores find nothing the directors will give it
up as a bad job. The mine has about 220,000 tons of
sulphides, which isn’t enough to warrant the big
expenditure that would be necessary to practically
renew the long-idle concentrating mili; so, if nothing
more is found, some other co. will no doubt get the
chance to make a bid for the ore in the mine.

B. H. Junction North, which has always
been rickety in parts, had a small creep last week,
when about 2000 tons of stuff crushed on to the No.
10. When an underground movement starts you
never know when . it will end; still that isn’t the
worst feature about the Junction North. The real
cause for gloom is the fact, that, on present appear-
ances, it can’t last as a mine longer than between
three and four years; after that, it will lose its ore
body. It hopes to prolong its days by turning itself
into an industrial concern, though it isn’t well
situated for that. There were people who thought
it might suck some life out of the neighboring
Junction, and the directors thought hard over that
idea. But, like most people, they can’t see any
profit in the Junction semi-derelict.

Two out of every three Australian sluicing
cos. under-estimate the job of getting water, and
Bourke’s Hill was one of the two. It was floated
in Melbourne in 1906, to work some ground near
Emmaville (N.S.W.), and the moderately dry winter
up that way has hung up the bigger of its two
plants most of the past half-year. Partly as a
consequence, the half-year’s profit, after writing off
£258 for depreciation, was only £32; and, though
one sixpenny div. was paid, it had to come out of re-
serves, That div. ( £1125) brought the total paid
to £6750, on a capital of £16,875. The co. has
been picking up odd bits of ground, the old area
being about worked out, and it reckons that it
now has four years’ full work ahead; but it will
have to spend some money on a water supply, and
there will be a steady drain for pumping, so future
results are very uncertain, even should the tin market
decide to fall no lower.

There is talk on the Golden Mile of an ■
amalgamation of the Horseshoe and the Boulder.
That something of the kind would be politic is con-
ceded, but how it is to be managed, with the
Horsehoe in its present mess, is so far not shown.
The advantages are plain. The, Horseshoe will be
18 months or more putting the shaft down to the
2800 ft., where the diamond drill shows the
Boulder’s boundary lode to be running strongly into
its ground. Meanwhile the Boulder has a shaft along-
side the boundary, from which the lode could be
easily worked. At present the shaft is used as a
main hauling way, but this could be easily altered,
and the ore raised from the northern pit.

J. W. Sutherland, of the Golden Horse-
shoe (W.A.), has been whooping about the results
obtained by using coarse screens on the battery
boxes. In figuring out a plant to crush from 28,000
to 30,000 tons a month, he reckoned on using screens
having about eight holes to the inch. Since then he
has managed to do things with four-mesh screens,
and he joyfully remarks that if the grinding of the
product continues satisfactory, some of the 170
stamps now installed will not be needed. During
July 13Q stamps handled the tonnage. *
Gold Estates of Australia, Ltd., which
holds mining shares (mostly Australian), and build-
ing estates and allotments (mostly Westralian), has
just issued another report, regretting that “there
has been a lack of interest in all mining securities,
and that the prices of its belongings have steadily
fallen.” Profit and loss account shows a debit bal-
ance of £1915, including £592 written off invest-
ments, part of which, it is naively added, should be
recovered when the co.’s holdings rise in value again.
The undivided accumulated profits have now
dwindled to £5845, but on the strength of a report
that the State Government’s immigration policy is
beginning to have an effect on the real estate market,
this sum is expected to be largely increased during
the current vear. A rude awakening, however,
awaits the co. when it tries to turn its expectations
into cash.
The flotation of the Westralia United
Goldfields, Ltd. (to which respectful attention was
drawn in B. 6/4/’ll) having failed, an attempt is
now being made in London to form another co. to
carry the burden, and obviate the painful necessity
of returning subscribers their money. All going
well, an area of 394 acres, comprising numerous
holes in the ground at Kalgoorlie, Bullfinch, Mount
Margaret and elsewhere, was to have been passed on
at a profit of £20,000 and a big share interest; but
as the public subscriptions were barely sufficient to
pay the bills for advertising and entertaining, the
thing had to be dropped. Now it has been decided
to take less for the properties, but how much less
is not stated. Altogether some nine or 10 shows are
included in the flotation; and although, as The
Bulletin previously pointed out, their combined
prospects don’t offer much security, the annual net
profits are, so far as can be learned, still estimated
by the promoters at £312,000. It will come as a
pleasant surprise if they earn for shareholders that
many pence.
The tale about oil at Warren River
(W.A.) is again being told. No reason is given
for this resurrection, beyond the vague statement
that somebody recently mentioned oil to someone
else. On the strength of this, efforts are being
made to induce J. Bull to come in. At the time
the previous yarn was spun, in 1904, the State Gov-
ernment was induced to grant a subsidy on a report
that the strata of the Texas oil country and of
Warren River were as like as two peas. In due
course a bore, put down through sea-sand to a ver-
tical depth of 1750 ft., proved them to be as unlike
as a pea and a pea-hen, and, finally, the venture
was abandoned as hopeless. Since then romantic
accounts of how the Indian Ocean lapped the petro-
leum-fringed shores have not appeared in the local
papers, and no further prospecting has been done;
wherefore J. Bull had better make a few further in-
quiries before he plunges.
Chaffers (W.A.) had a flutter a few weeks
ago on the report of a lode running to 35ft. wide, and
worth over loz. But the usual thing has happened, and
the run of ore has shrunk again. The Chaffers is
not yet out of the broken zone which affects the
Horseshoe so badly, but may find enough ore to keep
the plant going while it is getting into deeper and
more settled country.

Late reports from the Great Fingall
(W.A.) raise additional hopes of the mine’s future.
At the No. 18 level there is 6ft. of stone, and 4ft. 3in.
of it goes £4 a ton. Above this, on the No. 17
level, the shoot showed 395. a ton; and at the No. 16
level there was 31s. ore of about the same width.
When the shaft gets down so that this body of ore
may be properly tested, something should again be
heard about the Day Dawn centre.

Mclntyre and J. V. Kearney have what, on surface
glistenings, appears a good thing in the Great Un-
known, 10 miles east of Marda, the old Mount Jack-

south, are gaudy—7oz. and 4oz.—and there is an
ironstone formation at the north end, alongside
quartz, which goes 15dwt. Hill and Randolph Bed-
ford have sold their interests to those already named.

10oz., blit assays of 240 z. and 48oz. have been got in
a 25ft. trench. The co. has pulled out of Yilgarn
altogether, though it has not yet abandoned Golden
Bullfinch.

Zeb Lane’s old colliery, the Wallsend Pro-
prietary, at Collie (W.A.), has had rocky times.
The pit was one of the first opened some 15 years
ago in Westralia’s only coalopolis, and it saw a good
deal of varied strife, and had a good deal of uphill
barrow-pushing in its young days. Then more
trouble blew in a year or two ago, when the prin-
cipal section took fire, and it has cost within a kick
of £6OOO to merely hold the raging devil in check.
The spectacle the devil presented before being
finally bottled up was a remarkable one. Tongues
of living, white-hot fire curled like the flames of
Tophet through the workings, while on the
surface, at the upcast shaft, a jet of ignited
gas sprang heavenward 60ft. or more. Since
the big inferno has been battened down, to
smother in its own gases, outbreaks of black
damp have occurred, and of late two miners
have lost their lives, and four others have had a
look across the Styx. Much of the lower mine has
been flooded and rendered unworkable, and the co.
is now opening a new No. 3 pit away east of the
fire-affected zone. This pit, the Bullfinch, is going
down on the old seam in more settled country, and
with every promise of proving greatly extended
measures. The new colliery expected to commence
tipping last week.

At Charters Towers (Q.) the Bonnie Dun-
dee crushed 278 tons, for an average of £5 10s. 6d.
per ton, a reminder of the boom times a while back,
when the Bonnie shelled out sixpenny dividends
pretty often. They are now developing levels below
the 609 ft. formation. The stopes above No. 1 have
provided 1241 tons, which gave a battery yield of
15200 z. ; but it took eight months to get that much
out. The average per month was 155 tons-—not
nearly enough to pav dividends on the big mob of
shares. The 609 ft. formation in the Bonnie con-
tinues into Marshall’s Queen, so some sinking is to
be done from Marshall’s 500 ft. level, to pick up the
run of good stone proved near the boundary. Mar-
shall’s workings on the 1326 ft. formation extend
westwards from the Queen Central, so the latter has
a block of mineral stone to stope; but, generally
speaking, this 1326 ft. formation was a bit disap-
pointing to Marshall’s, with its big lot of shares.

The new field at Woodlark Island, off the
Papuan coast, is producing a few very fine returns.
The Woodlark King in putting through 300 tons; a
little of the stuff is worth up to 250 z. to the ton,
and the bulk is worth (say) 3oz. The King’s stone
is, however, exceptional; the few other claims aver-
age anything from lOdwt. to lloz.

Maytown, 120 miles S.W. of Cooktown
(Q.), is to have a revival. A co., in 30,000 shares,
has been floated to operate four leases, including the
Ida, which in the old days produced 7000 tons of
rich stone. A heavy flow of water stopped the old
hands at the 200 ft. level. The other shows —Just in
Time, Albion and Louisa —have also been worked to a
limited extent, the Louisa producing 1522 .tons of
payable stone. As a heavy expenditure on equip-
ment will be necessary, the State Government is
spending £l5OO to put the road in repair.

Bendigo has had a tussle over the control
of the Catherine Reef United. The Lansell family
wanted more than one of the blood on the Board,
seeing that it held 25,000 shares out of 62,000. On
the other side, the Hooper-Bayne crowd, with 31,000
shares, decided to cling like limpets to the table;
and, as they polled every vote of their block, they
just snicked a win. It is whispered that the old
Bendigo claim is to be fed on some Westralian
ideas. The half-century-old battery at the Catherine
is to jangle out its woes no longer. Dead David
Syme’s costly Yorkshire Tarnagulla plant is to replace
it. A change is certainly called for; something better
than a 55.-a-ton mill bill is wanted when the dirt
is worth only 6dwt. As the stopes run up to 40ft.
in width, years of work are ahead; so it will pay
the mine to scrap the old plant, and hustle out
more stone. The co.’s div. record is £136,580, in-
cluding a couple of “sprats” forked out last half-
year ; and there will be something to add to the total
when the new mill has got its hustle on.
* * * *
A weep is being done over the fact that
the North Woah Hawp, Ballarat East, has got
on to the call list, after 11 years of graft; but, even
with the present 6d. asked of them, shareholders
have only put £B4OO into the mine, or 7s. a share,
and they have seen £529,500 worth of gold come out,
of which they have got £52,050, or £2 4s. 6d. per
share. Now the first nip is to be felt by the worker,
as those on unproductive ground have got the kick-
out. The co. intends to hustle its shaft along to try
for fresh makes at lower levels. This job ought to
have been tackled when things were more financial,
instead of waiting till the call stage had cropped up.
* * * *
Walhalla wants the Long Tunnel to let go
its hold on the Great South Long Tunnel ground, so
that the residents may try a hand with the claim.
Cecil, now of the South Mount Cameron, ran the
Great South for many years. Careful as he was, he
could not get ore that did more than meet expenses,
with the aid of an occasional call. But he had to
cover the tribute. What Walhalla ought to do is to
persuade Minister Mcßride to tell the Long Tunnel
directors that they’ll have to work the Great South
area or bust. If Rowe snorts out a negative, as is
likely, Peter is entitled to make the Long Tunnel’s
idleness a reason for tackling the whole subject of
the non-fulfilment of labor conditions on leases that
have been amalgamated with a central claim. Ben-
digo badly wants this done, and so does Ballarat.
Before acting, Peter Mcßride should, however, get
an assurance from Walhalla that the folk who are
talking intend to mine the Great Southern, as there
are some frothy blades there.
Frank B. Powell returned to Melbourne
last week, after his 2000-mile motor ride to and
from Cloncurry, to see P. P. Cook’s Northern Terri-
tory silver-lead show. Powell says he didn’t have
to replace his goggles with a magnifying glass to
distinguish the outcrops, but he isn’t describing
what he saw as a fresh Broken Hill on the shores
of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Prospector King, who
is left behind to sink on the lode, sings that song;
Powell won’t go farther than to say that it is worth
spending £5OOO upon. He might do worse than roll
P. P. Cook up to the Home Affairs Department, and
get King O’Malley to sway the Cabinet to vote £
for £ for the proper trial of the great and almost
unknown district.

The Primrose (Tas.), next door to the
Tasmanian Copper Mine, keeps the pot boiling by
shipments of sulphides to Zeehan. In the last month
it sent away 1000 tons, estimated to contain 100
tons of lead, 12,7160 z. silver and 170 oz. gold—•
quantities that make the ore assay 10 p.c. lead,
12.70 z. silver and 3.4dwt. gold. The gross value of
a ton of “lead,” taking the base metal at £l4,
would be £33 10s., representing the theoretical ex-
traction from 10 tons of ore. There are, however,
metal losses and heavy deductions; so, though re-
turning charges have been cut to the bone, the public
will fall in if it figures on the nice-looking assays.

Tasmania feels very sore over the way
Melbourne has treated the Latrobe Shale and Oil
Co., and, incidentally, Tasmanian shale and
oil prospects in general. Launceston’s best-
known mining man, Leslie Jolly, sends a
long letter on the subject. He went to Mel-
bourne 16 months ago, he says, and introduced
Tasmanian shale to that city; and presently the
Baillieus came to terms. The little Tasmanian co.
was handed 26,000 shares in a new co. of 126,000
shares, and £3350 was to be paid over in August.
The new co. put up no capital, apparently, but relied
on calls to do its prospecting; and when August
arrived, and the £3350 was called for, “in place of
the money we were handed the now-celebrated report
of Mr. De Bavay, in which they stated that they
had turned down the property. In other words, they
had the use of the property, practically to do what
they liked with, for 15 months, for a few worthless
pieces of paper called paid-up shares, which never
had a market, and never changed hands—heads I
win, tails you lose.” But though the vendors
couldn’t trade in their shares, “the so-called pur-
chasers had a mild gamble on a small scale in con-
tributing shares.” And when the vendors ask for
the cash ( £3350), they are told they can sue the co.
for it if they like ; but, as it is a no-liability concern,
with no funds, they have Buckley’s chance of getting
anything.
But it is the turning down and the adverse report
that seems to trouble the Tasmanians most. Says Mr.
Jolly: “No reports of any mining operations, either
shafts or bore holes, or the results of a big bulk
parcel of shale sent to Scotland, or the Admiralty
tests, or the manager’s reports, have ever been pub-
lished for the benefit of shareholders at large; in
other words, any information, good, bad oir indif-
ferent, has remained the sole property of the Board
and its officers. As regards the report of Mr. De
Bavay, I am not aware that Mr. De Bavay has
ever been looked upon as a mining expert (as a
chemist, of course, he is known) ; and, in any case,
it is 12 years since he was on the mine, and there
had not been a pick put into it then; consequently
his report should be taken for what it is worth. It
would appear from his figures that he had gone in
for retorting and high refining, a thing Tasmania
would never have thought of. Fuel oil, petrol, and
a residue used as a fertiliser were the only objects
in view. On that basis the property can be worked
and mined at a profit. Then, again, it is made to
appear that the crude oil did not meet the demands
of the Admiralty. As against this, the report from
the Scotch co. which treated the bulk sample, defin-
itely states that it does comply with the Admiralty
requirements. He does not recognise the value of
the residue as a fertiliser; still the fact remains
that the farmers on the North-west Coast who have
used it are so satisfied that they have sent repeat
orders.”
It is complained, also, that, when the bulk sample
(70 tons) was sent to Scotland for treatment, a local
protest was made against the inclusion of stuff from
a seam that was known to contain nothing of com-
mercial value. The reply was: “Yes, but to dis-
card it would reduce the tonnage available on the
property.” In the same way, a large area was
taken up, though it was well known much of it
didn’t contain shale; but the Melbourne people
“desired a larger area than the original 800 acres
acquired.” Finally: “Many side-lights might be
thrown upon the extraordinary manner in which this
property has been handled, to the detriment not
only of the shareholders in Tasmania, but of the
State. It looks as if the trail of a cer-
tain serpent was over it all. . . . There
is only one consolation, and that is, we
shall be able to find the money here to carry on
the work ourselves, in our own way, without the
extravagant quarter of a million which the Messrs.
Baillieu so glibly talked about. That even they are
not infallible, is proved by the fact that they
turned down the Tongkah Harbor, a propertv
which is now regularly paying substantial divi-
dends.”
Tongkah, the Malay tin-producer owned
by Australians, will be joined within a week or two
by the Tongkah Compound, and in November the
North Tambun should be heard from. The Compound
is a bucket-dredging proposition, in 50,000 fully
paid £1 shares. The ground, at the head of Tong-
kah Harbor, has been well bored, and there appears
to be very little doubt about steady profits ; but in-
vestors will have to remember all the time that the
ground will be dredged out in four or five years, and
there doesn’t appear to be any other country avail-
able for the dredge to bite at. A big proportion of
the “dividends” will, therefore, have to be regarded
as return of capital. The North Tambun, which is
in the Ipoh mining district, adjoins the great
Tambun property, and is probably more speculative.
On account of the rough bottom a suction dredge
will be used there; and both costs and recoveries are
more uncertain. This co. is in 60,000 shares, of
which 30,000 are contributing, and paid to 12s. 6d.
Both dredge s have been built in Australia; Robert
Eastman, ioimerly of Cope’s Creek Central (N.S.W.),
will manage the North Tambun, and J. S. Henry,
formerly of Melbourne, is in command at the Com-
pound.

not only is it good, pure, reliable

"Robur” is the most saving tea

QUALITY-BUCHANAN WHISKY
“BLACK & WHITE.”
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, October 2, 1911.
My Dear Arini. —
A Minister for Dancing is here suggested
as the only correct answer to the Lancers’
riddle in which Sydney’s official personages
habitually lose their identity at public balls.
The man who can’t dance, and is forced to
circumnavigate the solid globe of a lady who
is also at sea in the tricky figures of State
dances, wants to be firmly confronted
with the goblin of his own ignor-
ance, under some new Act of Parliament,
txovernment House balls this season have
been officially opened in a chaotic whirl of
uncertain male footsteps hopping round the
three or four dames who knew where they
meant to go. The Denmans, Lady Barttelot
and Mayoress Allen Taylor practically
saved several links in a grand chain on Fri-
day night from finishing up in the garden
path or any other handy place to which they
tried to escape.
The G.-G. Denmans’ first hop in this ham-
let was handsomely trimmed with roses,
Chinese lanterns, Knee-breeches, diamonds
and other luxuries. The roses climbed over
a lattice that walled in the back of the
vice-regal dais ; they crawled over the front
fence of the musicians’ perch, and went on
wandering over every available nook in the
verandah, in an orgy of pink and white
bloom. The floral riot was the most exten-
sive attempt to turn Government House ball-
room into a garden which the old home’s
yellow satin sofas have seen for years.
The serious entertainment known as vice-
regal lancers opened the ball, with the usual
swish of satin skirts. His Ex., an alert
figure, very trim about the waist in the new
official finery, got away in a brisk sporting
stride with Acting-Gov. Cullen’s gentle
dame. Hard on their heels came her Ex., in
a blaze of diamonds and tunic drapery, with
the weary-looking Knight Cullen. Sydney’s
Mayoress, a capable dancer; several yards
of Scarlet Giant (Major Quilter) : Lady
Barttelot, in a shimmer of ivory satin that
twinkled with frosted silver net; Chief Jus-
Griffith’s plump lady, and other official
upper-cuts, who are habitually let loose when
a G.-G. leaps in the presence of his guests,
took the first chill off the proceedings
Dr. Odillo Maher twirled round in a dance
with his debutante daughter at this spree.
Mrs. G. Sly showed a graceful drapery of
dull purple, with a gleam of satin under-
neath. a lady in black showed both her
slender legs in the waltz, having gripped her
morsel of skirt up to the knees (a sensa-
tional accident occasioned by the fashionable
absence of petticoat). Mrs. T. H. Kelly re-
volved in a garment of beauty, like an orange
mist with a sunstroke shining through its
chiffons; and a handsome display of decora-
tive busts whizzed round the room, heavily
arrayed in diamonds and other costly gauds.
Government House, on Friday night, was
not rushed by eligible young men who ached
to dance with nice girls. The elderly beaux,
when not too stiff about the knee-joints, had
to take the places once filled by active youth,
and sprint round the polished floor with
Sweet and Twenty. The modern girl accepts
with Christian resignation any partner the
Society matron drops by the wayside.
Lord Dick Nevill nursed his gout in his
own apartment on Friday night. The re-
cently-arrived Private Sec. Vernon took his
white silk stockings on a voyage of dis-
covery round Society’s brand-new varnish.
Mrs. Monty Severn, in blue, followed the
prevailing craze for two-toned garments—a
transparency of chiffon over a gloss of satin
in another color being the most expensive
frills worn at the rose-edged revel. Force of
habit gripped Premier Jim McGowen and
Opposition leader Wade by the leg, and
dragged them into seats exactly opposite each
other at an early crisis in the evening.
The G.-G. Denman’s air of strict attention
to business recalls the kindly Northcote —
now gone where no vice-regal lancers fall
over the golden gates—with a younger and
brighter outlook. Positively no frisky ladies
have any hope of successful scalp hunting
for the official thatch under this reign. The
new and sporting Gee-Gee has the inflexible
backbone of a person who conceals a Scottish
Sabbath somewhere under his brown roof.
The Australian school primer which deals
out the old dried mummy of history to de-
fenceless youth hereabouts has never men-
tioned what secret grudge incited the widow
of Governor King to present the portraits of
George 111. and his Apple Charlotte to Syd-
ney Government House. A large brass plate
on each picture mentions this bequest with
respect as having occurred in 1843. Five
years later Europe was convulsed by revo-
lution. The marvel is that it waited so long.
Occasional Governors are suspected of
having hated these dull persons with a
hatred that could only be assuaged by bury-
ing the royalties in an unused coal cellar or
scuttle. They now look as if they’d had their
faces washed and their frames rubbed up
for the race-week balls. Frances Burney’s
“Sweet Queen” is the type of female fool
who’s exasperating even in oils; and she
gazes down at the dancers with the same air
of serene surprise that marked the Char-
lotte attitude to genius when it fainted at
her feet from an overdose of stay-lacing done
in honor of royalty. In the pleasant days
of old, stay-lacing was a sacrament, and
young ladies of quality were hanged by the
neck every morning while the deed was done.
They were not hanged tightly, but they were
hanged, and suspension caused intense
elongation of the young lady, and elonga-
tion made her thinner for the moment, and
then the stay-lacer seized her opportunity.
Queen Charlotte has the vacant air of a lady
to whom this sort of experience was fami-
liar.
Somebody once said—presumably after a
local garden party —that it took three
generations (pure English) to wear a silk
hat (an appalling waste of time). There’s
an ounce of meat in this statement, for the
black tile is a purely British fetich and re-
quires certain traaitions —principally a short
cron of hair and a capacity for suddenly in-
flating the head so as to keep the hat on
wnen the squall strikes it. Only a person
who can, at the shortest notice, inhale six
gallons of air, and thus blow out las head
to special dimensions, should wear what the
Americans call a plug hat and the old Scots
a “him.” Conductor Angelini at the races,
with a silk cylinder or funnel perched on his
long front hair, was like a canary blighted
by an exaggerated black thimble.
Mrs. Mendelssonn Tickles, of this side,
has been mentioned amongst recent Fog
Land trippers. The combination of Men-
delssohn and Pickles is a form or nomencla-
ture not easily mislaid even in the Thames
village.
Mr. W. Motor Kelly, M.11.R., who reached
this city safely after a scamper across
Europe, struck Sydney, behind a large cigar,
in the same train that landed the Denmans,
and was re-consecrated with the “Liberal”
blessing at Paddington Town Hall last week.
Mr. C. Oakes was the High Priest who
poured the welcome oils over the Kelly
brow.
A non-dancing naval person —who was cut-
ting his first whiskers —explained his atti-
tude, against the wall, at the G.-G. Den-
mans’ first party. A good-natured dame had
tried to bring up, to this shrine for brass
buttons, various girls who wanted to dance.
“Re-ally I’d rather not—l don’t care to
dance—it makes me too tired, don’t you
know—what?” Britain’s first fist of defence
is getting so weedy in its junior legs that a
little phvsical culture behind a gun (in the
event of the war spirit going on the burst)
will either kill or cure it.
Late Sergeant-at-Arms “Larry” Harnett’s
genial manner and reservoir of anecdotes
were switched on to his disagreeable business
of professional rusher-out of offending
M’s.L.A. with such success that, for over 30
years, he was one of the best-liked men in
the Macquarie-street talk shop. He is said
to have even told interesting stories to legis-
lators as he tore them off the premises.
The sudden death of the brilliant Dr.
Fishbourne, an expert on the nerves and
brain, and one of the incandescent lights of
the recent Pill Mobilisation in this village,
from the approximate subject of his scien-
tific study, is one of the curious ironies of
life on this mud ball.
The Turkish Delight, who has been sniff-
ing advanced Western ideas through the lat-
tice of her harem for some years, has now a
magnificent chance to get a word in edge-
ways, while the Sultan’s head-choppers are
on the Italian beat.
Derby Day opened race week with a
bright splash of blue skies and green velvet
lawns, nicely watered by a thunderstorm the
previous day. Freaks were less frequent on
the Randwick lawn than at the autumn
meet. The lady who trailed yellow plush
under the shade of a green gingham was an
occasional accident, and did no serious
damage to the landscape.
Capital, which is accused of having scam-
pered off to Europe, must have forfeited its
passage money at the last moment. Aus-.
tralia is booming, and the gorgeous plumage
of the women seen at the race-week dress
parades is probably a record. Tons of money
have been sprinkled over the spring meeting,
and the Girl and her Gown are on the crest
of Australia’s golden wave.
Miss B. Holdship, who chipped through
her shell as a race-week debutante, was all
maize on Derby Day with corn-colored hair
and brown velvet eyes. Miss Marjorie Hen-
derson’s slim beauty was draped in tussore
muslin with a remark in black satin on the
Dana Gibson bodice. Mrs. Horsfall, who
bolted from competition, was also clad in
the tussore tint which is an obsession of the
moment. These artistic drapes recalled a
“Lady Frederick” repartee: “Your clothes
are so simple and charming,” insists Ewart-
Paradine. “That’s why they are so expen-
sive,” says the lady with the vast dress-
maker’s bill.
White satin or other lustrous sheen under
a thin cloud of black chiffon was one of the
best doubles on the Randwick lawn this
week. Miss Clara Manning and Mrs. Ernest
Wilshire wore black and white with distinc-
tion. As a matter of fact, Australian women
ran away from most of the oversea visitors
at the races, and even the songbirds of the
grand-opera aviary flapped their wings a
yard of two behind our own girls.
The huge Japanese silk or velvet bow now
adorns the female form in the place that
once supported the bustle. On Derby Day
Mrs. George Vivers, in a froth of grey
chiffon, had a great black velvet bow on this
portion of her person. The pretty, preco-
cious Morton youngsters, in white frocks,
were bowed behind with wide flaps of pink
silk. Grey was one of the Randwick favor-
ites and the shimmer of pearl grey worn by
Mrs. Anthony Hordern on Derby Day would
have turned the head of a saint. Miss Jessie
Clark owned a grey cloud with jewelled
edges. It proved the sound feminine in-
stinct of the Quaker ladies, who abjured
vanity and fascinated man in heart-breaking
tints of pearl and pale lavender.
Dr. McDonagh is rounding up the details
of a birthday party for the Sydney Hospital,
which is a hundred not out (not out of
debt, I mean). The Skating Rink, in Prince
Alfred Park, will be the place, and on Octo-
ber 25 a Poster and Skating Carnival, in
aid of the Sydney Hospital Centenary Fund,
is likely to push a fat cheque into the yawn-
ing hospital cash-box.
Rose Bay links disgorged a casual snake
or two during the recent inter-State click of
golf balls, and the human grasshopper, offici-
ally catalogued as “caddie,’' stole some
secret joy in consequence. This joy was
afterwards frayed at the edge because the
first golfers who met six feec of snake coiled
round a hole in the course had previously
inspected that wild animal’s death squirm."
Miss Parbury, who snatched the Austra-
lian golf championship (in petticoats) from
Miss Duret, the other day, is the slender,
sinewy type of woman who is physically as
hard as nails. This variety of the feline crea-
ture, with the keen, bright eye of a bird, is the
new blend of athletic brilliance and endur-
ance which, in spite of Mr. Foster Phraser’s
hints at race deterioration, is rapidly evolv-
ing as a confirmed habit amongst Australian
girls.
The Acting-Governor Cullens made a meek
appearance at the Criterion, the other night,
supported by the strains of “Gor’ Save.”
They dropped into their seats with no osten-
tation and a leg-weary air of having chased
the Pill and Porous Plaster Party to the
edge of the grave. Captain Dumaresq, who
owns the most ferocious moustache in a
comparatively clean-sliaved city, and Cap-
tain Verney, were in their usual places.
Ethel Irving, as Lady Frederick, refuses
a Marquis in her dressing-gown, and dis-
misses a Jew moneylender and an Admiral
in a poem of cream and rose made by Red-
fern. A subtle suggestion of rose under lace
drapery with a froth of gossamer cobweb at
the neck is another of Lady Frederick’s
triumphs in the art of being beautifully
dressed on credit.
A few of the bright sparks of wit which
make Lady Frederick’s acquaintances scin-
tillate would illuminate Government House
balls for some years. “I fear you are —-
excuse me for saying so —rather a snob.”
Says Lady F.: “My mother was an English-
woman —I have the instincts of her race”—
thus Halliw'ell Hobbes as Captain Mont-
gomery, the Jew moneylender with a foreign
father. “I saw you the other day with the
wife of a city knight, says Lady Freder-
ick —a nasty thrust at the Montgomery
efforts to struggle up into the cerulean blue
peerage. “I am so charmed to meet you,”
says the purple satin dressmaker to Para-
dine Fouldes (Ewart). “I hear you are
such a bad man !”
Ben Davies, who recently spread his fine,
upstanding tenor over the problem of get-
ting Maud into the garden—with loud ap-
plause from large audiences in the Town
Hall—tackles this evergreen topic in a more
subtle fashion than the clarion call of Tenor
Turnpenny, of the Sheffield Voices. Ben-
jamin begins in soft staccato notes, wastes
no time, and gets the hurried patter of
small satin-shod feet into his first remark,
“Come into the Garden, Maud,” followed
by the loud stamp of manly boots, when he
snaps his fingers at Mrs. Grundy; “I am
here at the gate alone!” Benjamin’s seren-
ade to Maud is the most attractive lilt this
town has heard for a considerable time.
Zeni, as Lohengrin, in the magnificently
clothed opera of that name, is covered with
silver scales like a fish that has just in-
herited moneyi from its rich uncle, carries a
shield of surpassing shininess, and wears the
Wagner variety of poultry farm millinery—
an able-bodied swan —roosting on his golden
curls. Zeni-Lohengrin’s wedding dress—
mostly white brocade stiff with rich garni-
ture —is a mediaeval challenge to the modern
male person, who creeps meekly to the altar
rail in sad-colored garments —black for
choice —and puts his head into a silk stove-
pipe as a defence against old shoes, con-
fetti and uncooked rice.
Eleanora de Cisneros, the sinister Ortrud of
the first-night perfo’—mnce of “Lohengrin,”
was the best-dressed dame on the edge of
the Scheldt in the days when Henry the
Fowler did police-court business over the
affairs of Elsa of Brabant. Ortrud, who has
a knife in her temper, sticks the blade into
Elsa’s character in a massive robe of ash-
rose silk, with the red glare of rubies gleam-
ing on its lattice-work tracery and fierce
brown scrolls fencing off the hem of the
skirt.
Jeanne Wayda sings her sweet lay as
Elsa, in the foam of ethereal white drapery
which mediaeval story considered appronriate
to the understudy of an angel. Wagner
modernises Elsa, and serves her up in opera
with a note of interrogation in her song.
“Who art thou?” warbled with the usual
persistency with which woman tries to drive
nails into domestic shadows, makes Lohen-
grin bolt for freedom and the cold-water
cure of the river Scheldt. A first-night audi-
ence flung applause, mixed with flannel
flowers and other vegetable matter, at
Polish Wayda. Marshall-Hall’s black thatch
towered over the orchestra in the ecstasy of
hand-beating Wagner along the shores of the
painted foreign creek.
Miss Evelyn Chapman was encouraged to
get away from this continent with a large,
leather-clad volume on Art, which was
handed over to her the other day in Datillo-
Rubbo’s studio, by her fellow-students. The
girl is going to pursue oil painting in Europe,
and shows every symptom of catching it
with success.
The Girls' Realm Guild will break out in its
annual financial statement, under the wing
of Lady Denman, on October 13. The King’s
Hall will be the place, and the Trust Fund
threepenny-bits will be spring-cleaned under
the eye of organising sec. Grace Burrows.
Rex de Cairos-Rego has plunged into har-
monious chords, and has set Longfellow’s
song. “She is a Maid of Artless Grace” in a
melodious music frame.
Millinery, this spring, is chiefly divided into
wide-and-flat, and tall-and-sugarloaf. The tall
Woman can place her head in a large plate of
straw or silk, put a wreath of flowers round
its saucer crown, and achieve a complacent
frame of mind in the presence of friends and
toes. The smaller person, under a tower of
roses, or a yard or two of lancer plume, can
totter along the Randwick lawn, equally con-
tent. _ Both are attired in the last gasp of
Bashion. One fatality that appeared at the
races, a narrow black roof with a wreath of
white camellias, ought to be avoided, as too
near the undertaking trade.
“Rosna” drops a line from London:—
Melba had her portrait painted before leaving for
the kangaroo country, the artist being Orlando Rou-
land, an American who has daubed the faces of Car-
negie, Roosevelt, Edison, and other large persons.
He rushes over to paint the lily in London every
season, and this year wielded his august brush in
the studio of no less a demi-god than Herkomer.
Soprano Carrie Lanceley left these shores
for Fogland on September 30.
May you remain beautiful for 1000 years,
my dear Arini.
VANDORIAX.
When Sheol broke loose at Toulon:—
The smoke from the burning battleship (Liberte)
enveloped the roadstead. The battleship Re mb-
lique (14,635 tons), which was lying in the vicinity,
had a large hole torn in her hull, caused by flying
debris, and lost 50 of her crew.
The armored battleships Democratic and Verite
(both 14,635 tons) were also badly damaged, ami
lost between them 20 killed and 50 injured.
Every ship in the harbor was shaken from mast-
head to keel. Houses rocked and windows were
smashed throughout Toulon.
One of the Liberty's buglers was hurled aboard the
ltfipublique. When he was picked up he still held
the bugle in his hand. Splinters of a shell struck
the Foudre, a gunnery-school vessel, two miles dis-
tant, killing the commander and wounding two of
the crew. Fragments of metal injured six seamen
of a boat belc/.mng to the cruiser Leon Gambetta.
One was killed. A launch belonging to the cruiser
Ernest ltenan was sunk, and its occupants drowned.
That’s the sort of thing that happens when
a modern battleship lets loose the seven
devils it carries in its innards—and only God
knows when the loosening may arrive. At
Toulon it was chiefly warships that got the
gruelling, because Toulon isn’t a crowded
commercial port—like Sydney, for instance.
No naval Power keeps its fleet at crowded
commercial ports. The French horror makes
one wonder how Sydney would fare if, some
day, the Powerful, say, at her moorings in
Farm Cove, should get suddenly tired of
doing nothing and go baresark. Possibly, if
certain parochial fools get their way, and the
principal Australian naval station is jammed
into the vitals of the teeming commercial
port, Sydney may yet know all about it.
Then it will want to hang the parochial
fools. It might be better to hang them now.

In the home where there are young children
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is indispensable, as
you will see by the following letter written by Mr.
Robt. Bowman, Herekino, N.Z.: “I have found
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy to be a certain cure
for croup, and the only medicine I could get to cure
my children of whooping cough. It cured them of
this disease after I had used all sorts and descrip-
tions of other remedies.”*

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 2, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie, —
On Wednesday of last week, a galaxy,
tribe or mob of women gathered like home-
less hens on the steps of the Treasury, and,
after considerable discussion amongst them-
selves, advanced on Acting-Premier Watt’s
audience chamber. The object of the depu-
tation was to urge that the sex be repre-
sented on the Charities Board. But they
had to travel a long way before they found
their prey. During their wanderings through
the corridors they passed groups of hatless
men, who wore pens behind their ears and
grins in front thereof, and a general air of
having nothing urgent on hand. The in-
vaders at last ascertained the right door,
and fluttered in till the place was like a
fowl-roost on a wet day. Various speakers,
all more or less agitated, then proceeded to
tell Murray’s understudy why they had
burst into his time. Drs. Edith Barrett and
Constance Ellis, Mrs. Strong and a couple
of others took it in turn to put the case for
the prosecution. Then W. Watt smiled
grimly, and made a few jokes (the sort that
you bring along on a lorry and unload witii
a steam crane). After that he handed round
some mild Ministerial soothing-powders, and
bowed the deputation out. Calling on an
Acting-Premier seems to me like crossing the
Alps at great expense of time and trouble,
and finding nothing on the other side.
The Search for the Body seems to have
got on the nerves of the community. Here
is a case in point: A perfectly respectable
householder had some skulls and an assorted
lot of bones, belonging to his doctor son,
stowed away in his study. One day he got
tired of his caretaking job, or else he wanted
some more room for his books ; anyhow, he
gathered up the scientific relics and planted
them under the front verandah. A new
serving maid, who is a constant reader of the
Morning Skull and Evening Bloodstain,
saw him concealing the evidences of his sup-
posed crime, and informed the police. The
local members of the force took large, flat
steps to the scene, and staggered the harm-
less resident with a few leading questions of
awful significance. When he had recovered
somewhat from his amazement, he answered
them fully, and allayed their fondest suspi-
cions. They withdrew respectfully, and
Marianne was sacked with enthusiasm, and
told to take her Sherlock Holmes instincts
somewhere else. Even Fido, the house cur,
buries his bone in fear and trembling now.
First thing the poor beast knows, a large,
stout policeman is digging it up again, and
trying to recognise it as part of a Tragedy.
The other day Governor Fuller went to
the opening of the local show at Warrackna-
beal (commonly called “Warrack” by the
laconic natives), and was overwhelmed with
astonishment at the sight of the Mallee
wheat crops—mile after mile of green pad-
docks. At the present time, the wheat belt
reminds the wayfarer of a boundless lawn
which has not known the mower for many
months. The Malleeans are a chest-spread-
ing community these times. The last drought
stayed eight years with them; but the subse-
quent good seasons have healed the bank
accounts and rubbed salve into the farmers’
memories. People either don’t mention, or
else talk with reluctance, of the strings of
water-trains that once trailed through the
land. In those drear days, the only signs of
green were where the travelling tanks had
dripped on to the line. Now, the place is
like one vast garden. The soil is wonderful.
It does not require ploughing—merely has
to be scarified. All the same, it must have
water. It doesn’t raise dampness where none
was sown.
Toorak is suffering from a violent epi-
demic of tea parties. This week the Fuller
lady four-o’-clocked. Last week the Kirk-
patrick General’s wife hostessed to matrons
only, with Auntie Phipps, of State Govern-
ment House, and an elderly spinster or two
as shining exceptions to the rule. The pre-
vious day, Mrs. Jack Moffat, at the Simon
Frasers’ mansion, vied with the Baird sisters
(newly returned from abroad) at the
haughty hash tower known as Mandeville
Hall. The Bairds scored with a brace of
fortune-tellers, and the contest is hereby
awarded to them. It was not a knock-out,
but they won on points. Last Sunday, the
Emmerton-Brookes chick uppercut the Sab-
bath by holding a big musical At Horae.
Mild giddiness is rife in Melbourne’s loftiest
suburb.
The Fuller lady has broken the hard and
fast rule of former Excellencies, and allowed
a threepenny weekly to interview her. Her
published remarks, however, are not likely
to raise any excitement. They boil down to
a. wail over the limitations of the stuccoed
villas of Malvern, and a mournful inquiry
as to why Australians don’t devote more at-
tention to their front gardens.
A Melbourne woman, who was dining at
the Carlton when the sudden clanging of the
fire-alarm turned that tall London hotel into
a mad ahthill, says that she was caught up
and carried downstairs by “a real lord.” It
would be hard to burn down any pub in the
United Kingdom without smoking out some
of the peerage. At the same blaze, a man
who had been dressing ran out attired simply
in a kimono—which fact plainly indicates
that his wife’s garments were scattered all
over the apartment as usual.
Mrs. Rutter Clarke gave an afternoon
charity fete at Merriwa, her beautiful house,
the other day, and Mrs. Edward Miller and
sister-in-law Mrs. Albert helped energetic-
ally. The Fuller children came along and
had a good time on the merry-go-round.
Mamma had some hothouse vegetables pre-
sented to her by the Jim Purvis children and
the small Stuart Murray, and then sat on
the lawn alongside the other mammas and
watched the gambols.
Arthur Matear, of “The Lane,” went over
to Sydney last week and wedded pretty
Stella Sylvia Basche, daughter of Carl
Basche, of Greenfields, Kempsey. After the
unobtrusive wedding, the one that used to be
two went off to Medlow for a brief mooning.
After some months spent in the Fog, the
dressy Kelly sisters are returning to Aus-
tralia in time for the summer sunshine. The
pair ran a first-class bonnet shop for a
while, but relinquished it some time ago.
Possibly the hat privateers helped to drive
them out of business.
The daughter of a prominent Scotchby-
terian, just deceased, is shortly to seek re-
lease from the matrimonial yoke in the
Divorce Court. The cause has been dis-
creetly kept in the background for years;
but the day of hearing is now approaching.
Meanwhile, the pretty little petitioner has
gone off to another State for a change.
Artist Bunny’s charming little French
wife contracted influenza, and had to shut
herself up in Melbourne, while her husband
went north to Sydney to look after his pic-
ture show. Bunny had never seen Sydney
before, and was so delighted that he rushed
business in order to get back to Melbourne
and tell his partner the good news. “We’ll
do Sydney together,” he said, with the de-
lighted air of a devoted husband who has a
holiday treat in store. However, the equal
, sharing of artistic joys is not only practised
by artists. Big Dr. Strong, of Essendon,
who returned from the Medical Congress,
the other day, is an ardent music lover, but
he forswore grand opera in Sydney so that
he and his wife might hear it together in
Melbourne.
The stork has been busy of late in London
carrying babies to two Australian artists’
households. Mrs. Will Ruby Lindsay Dyson
got a dimpled baby girl, and Mrs. Streeton
(she used to be Norah Clench) presented
her husband with a small chubby model.
Georgie Musgrove, who gave up the boards
to marry George Reid (not the High Com-
missioner and eminent Dry Dog owner),
has added a son to the family circle. The
young man is now a veteran of two or three
weeks.
The widow Langdon has parted with one
dimpled daughter to Major Ewan Campbell.
Now another Campbell suitor has claimed
the hand of the second girl, Dorothy, and a
diamond half-hoop bears witness to the con-
tract. This second Campbell (he is known
as “Bert” to his intimates) will take his
bride to Mildura, where he has lately ac-
quired a nice little patch of soil, dotted with
orange trees.
_ Mrs. S. T. Staughton is at present on the
sick list, and the various societies whereof
she is president are languishing for her
presence. The literary circle of the Swas-
tika Club (which is one of the aforesaid)
gave a Browning afternoon on Wednesday
iast, when the members quoted liberally, and
then explained to one another what Robert
meant. Miss Unie Russell, with recitations,
and Misses Green and May Bird, with songs,
helped to interrupt the gush of Browning ex-
planations; but the circle got at it again as
soon as they had finished. When Robert is
at his best (or worst), I long for an inter-
mittent accompaniment of foghorns and
detonators. I don’t think he would have
dared to be so obscure if his name had been
just plain Brown. No magnificently-hatted
woman would let her tea get cold while she
explained a man called Brown. My own theory
divides the great bulk of the poet’s work into
three classes: In No. 1 he meant nothing ;
in No. 2 he meant something, but didn’t
know what it was; in No. 3 he thought he
meant something, but presently forgot what
he was driving at.
Colonel Weatherby, an “exchange officer”
from Canada, arrived in Melbourne a week
or so back, and found orders to proceed to •
Sydney waiting for him. The new chum
warrior thereupon promptly resumed his
march without more than a glance at this
city.
Died, last week, at Warrnambool, old Mrs.
Stevens, sister to Lady Roberts. She had
never completely recovered from the shock
caused by the death of another sister, Mrs.
Miller, who fell over a cliff in Honolulu,
during the homeward trip to Australia.
Possibly jealousy is responsible for the
current yarn about a recent engagement.
The man is a sailor, the girl a Melbournite.
She was staying in Sydney, and came gladly
to meet a few gold-braided mariners. The
hostess jokingly informed the party that an
heiress was about to arrive. And, to add to
the joke, she forgot to rectify the statement.
Certain cats speak of the oversight as “cruel”
to the poor man.
Mrs. Harvey Patterson’s one olive branch
was last week grafted on to the Nicol family
tree, when Leolyn Peel Sharp, usually known
as “Leo,” wedded Archibald McKellar Nicol,
of the M.L. clan. What time her mother
was Miss Athelstane, of swimming and
fencing fame, “LeoV figured as an expert at
both these arts. She and Annette Keller-
mann, in fact, were rivals at the St. Kilda
baths in the days of their teens. The wed-
ding—a very quiet affair —was from the
Harvey Patterson country house. Out of
compliment to stepfather, his racing colors
prevailed in the decorations, and there were
sugar horses, hurdles, bridles and other com-
pliments on the cake.
Word comes from Bananaland that one of
Victoria’s recent debutantes has been per-
suaded to stay there for good. The per-
suader is “Bobby” Cameron, who looks after
Dalgety’s interests in Townsville; the per-
suaded is pretty Lucy Keats, artist, tennis
champion, swimmer, equestrienne and a few
more things. In some roundabout manner
she is connected with the Ma State Osbornes,
on whose station she was to have stayed.
She will now probably hurry back to Mel-
bourne for the trousseau gathering.
A Melbourne heiress-apparent, well-favored
and in her upper teens, is generally seen
about these days with a big, fair mummer.
She teas, motes and skates with him, and
local youths, who have been side-tracked,
skate and mote at a reckless pace whenever
they meet the pair on ice or road. When
they encounter them in fashionable fooderies,
they sip moodily, and sit still like the care-
takers of Great Sorrows.
A bachelor medico, who has ignored the
sex since a famous divorce case, is brighten-
ing up under the benign influence of a fas-
cinating visitor from Fogland. This stranger
has the sinuous figure which is so admirably
adapted for the fashionable tube skirt.
The heroine of the most sentimental
divorce case which Melbourne produced in
the last 20 years, is now located in Bull’s
own country, and is to be the bonny bride of
a Cockney gentleman conspicuous by reason
of the size of his oof. The lady was fair to
see on this side, and, with' the assistance of
Parisian artists in hats, and the most tal-
ented Continental contrivers of gowns, she
is an acknowledged vision of splendor even
in London, where visions are numerous.
Mrs. Tom Hogan sends a coo-ee from
Wales, whither she and her mother fled after
the Coronation, and the exhausting heat-
wave that followed it. At time of writing,
they were living on a rock far out at sea, and
getting their meals regularly at the adjacent
hotel. During their journeyings, they came
across Patti, in a quiet little Welsh village
with the usual name that sounds like all the
dishes on earth falling downstairs. The now
silent songbird spends her days knitting in a
window-seat, and revelling in the perfume
and color of a lovely old garden. When she
wants a little excitement, she hires one of
the inhabitants to repeat the name of the
hamlet several times in rapid succession.
There really should be some distinctive
label for the woman medico. As soon as she
gets her degree, she retires behind a brass
plate, and is transformed from Jane Jones
to “Dr. Jones,” so that you can’t tell her
from Henry Jones, M.D., who lives up the
street, or Herbert L. Jones, M.R.C.S., who
practises round the corner. “Dr. Jane
Jones” is too much of a mouthful for a
hurried world, and “Dr. Jane” too familiar.
Personally, I think Jane should call herself
Doctress, Doctrine, or Doctorette, and so as-
sist people to distinguish between herself and
, her skilled brothers. For the lack of some such
distinctive tag, the sleeper booking for the
crowded Medical Congress trains to Sydney
got somewhat mixed. Dr. Dolly Dimples
discovered to her horror that she had been
allotted a berth in a carriage with three
medical men. The booking clerk had
assumed, as a matter of course, that “Dr.
Dimples” was a man, and put him in with
the boys.
The puzzling title caused another woman
traveller some temporary embarrassment on
arrival in Sydney. An aunt of great tonnage
and respectability met the weary arrival
and sympathised with her. “You poor dear !
Couldn’t you get a sleeper at all?” “It was
all right, Auntie,” prattled the pilgrim. “I
brought a cushion and a rug, and Dr. Dash
and I had a carriage to ourselves all the
night.” Auntie had made all arrangements
to swoon away, when the newly-arrived
averted the disaster by hastily explaining
that Dr. Dash’s front names were Clara
Alice.
Before Melba left for the Syd-
ney grand opera season, she dropped into
Ambrpse Patterson’s studio to have a glance
at her father’s portrait. She not only ap-
proved of if and took delivery there and
then, but became enamored of a Beaumaris
seascape on the wall, and intimated that she
must have it for her place.
Artist May Vale intends holding an ex-
hibition of enamels before the end of the
year. Lately, at the Field Naturalists’ Club
show, in the Masonic Hall, she was intently
studying gorgeous butterflies for reproduc-
tion.
The musical and dramatic circle of the
Swastika Club presented a double bill last
Monday, to an overflowing audience of mem-
bers and friends. The surplus perched with
cheerful but unobtrusive heroism on an im-
promptu amphitheatre constructed of lunch
tables and chairs. In “The Amateur Phreno-
logist,” Claude Hall aired a violent red wig
and a rich imitation of a brogue, and was
well played up to by Mrs. C. B. Moore, Mrs.
Malcolm and Arthur Fay. Mrs. Palmer
Archer’s playlet, “The Scribes,” was brightly
acted by Ivy Fink, Stella Nathan, Mrs.
Douglas Stewart, Mrs. Maurice Dudley and
Dick Roe.
Leslie Gaze, now on the sick list, has been
envied by most mummers of late. Mrs.
Leslie is not only pretty and fascinating,
but so devoted that she has hardly left the
bedside of her Chocolate Soldier all the time
he has been out of action. Domestic devo-
tion is what fhe mummer mostly misses in
his engagements. The pair were to have
worked the spinning jenny at the Adver-
tising Art Exhibition, but were only able to
put in a brief and belated appearance. The
devoted one is reputed to have the smallest
foot in the soubrette ranks of the American
stage.
The Medical Congress is now ancient his-
tory ; but about half this city’s doctors are
not yet back from it. I presume the Rand-
wick demonstrators in horse anatomy per-
suaded them to stay on for a lecture or two.
Melbourne’s municipal cat isn’t even now
satisfied with the size of its tail; wherefore,
though it has splashed a huge sum on a
new council chamber, a stylish kitchen, fancy
elevators, and other Town Hall fal-de-rals,
the city fathers have decided to burst up
£lO,OOO on widening the entrance and por-
tico —the absurd porch thing that butts out
into Swanston-street, and is liable to trip
up any pre-occupied giraffe that saunters
through that busy thoroughfare.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Hunt Club had a glorious spring day for its
annual meeting, and Woman turned up in droves
and her best frock. The Government House people
arrived in the full panoply of state, i.e., a carriage
and an escort of mounted Dunns. With them was Mrs.
Private Secretary Rowe. The first of the amateur
races—which are the events that mainly interest
those to whom these meetings appeal as glorified
garden-parties—opened disastrously. Just before
starting, Mark Time, who seemed a certainty, bolted
twice round the course in the wrong direction, after
which he was removed firmly to the saddling pad-
dock by his infuriated owner and maddened rider.
It was not the sort of conduct expected from a beast
with the calm, leisurely name of Mark Time. Brown
Bark added to the gloom by breaking his leg at the
last fence. Jack Adams, who secured the Hunt Club
Cup, was piloted by Mr. McGuiness, a Melbourne
man. (By the way, the horse is also Victorian-bred.)
There was a big crowd in the saddling paddock be-
fore the Bracelet. “Peter Doody” was riding Alge-
buckina for Mrs. Mortlock, and a few demented ones
expected him to appear in his “Arcadian” clothes.
Not so, however. He dressed like any other horse-
man, and steered his mount into a place. Mrs.
Aldridge secured the coveted bracelet. Manv of the
“Arcadians” were there. Mr. and Mrs. W. Pope
gave the usual President’s tea.
On Saturday night the Literary Theatre presented
George Calderson’s “The Fountain,” but the per-
formance wasn’t up to the average. Mayhap the
performers had done badly at the races, and were
brooding over the trouble; or, again, possibly they’d
been insufficiently rehearsed. Anyhow, they were
weak.
The Harry Duttons are on the move again. This
time in Maoriland, where fishing is to fill a ’arge
part of the programme. With them is Miss Nellie
Fotheringham.
The Graham Stewarts have come back from their
English trip, and the Edgar Luxmoores have given ■
up S. Africa as a place of residence, and are return-
ing here. Talking of S. Africa, “Jim” Blackmore
(son of the late Clerk of Parliaments) and his wife
are here on a holiday now, and both say they like it
better than the veldt.
Sydney Ayres-»one of the voluminous Ayres clan—
is engaged to Miss Edna Kidman. She’s the youngest
of the Cattle King's daughters, and has just returned
from a trip to England.
Th e Humphrey Martens gave a small dance at South
terrace t’other night, and a couple more of like
dimensions are booked for next week. Old customs
die hard here, but at last programmes are swept
clean of all but waltzes and two-steps.
The notion of acquiring Dingley Dell in memory
°t Adam Lindsay Gordon isn’t dead. Appreciators
of the poet are prepared to find the cash, provided
the property can be bought.
Lord Richard Nevill paid us a flying visit on
Sunday, coming up from the mail boat to dine at
Government House, on his way to the Denman
menage. We’re always glad to see him here, and
Adelaidians rejoice at his appointment to the Den-
man staff.
We’ve discovered a new attraction for tourists, in
the shape of hot springs at Oodnadatta. They’re
claimed to be as hot and as mineral as anything in
Maoriland, and to have completely cured one resident
of rheumatism. “Why,” say patriots, “spend money
on going to Maoriland, when you can be cured at
home for £20?”
Mr. Alfred Searcy published another book on the
Northern Territory (“By Flood and Field”) the other
day, and then wrote to Mr. E. W. Wallington
(“Better Not” Wallington) about it. As a result,
special copies are being prepared for presentation to
the King and the Prince of Wales.
Miss McPherson has finished the portrait of Miss
O. H. Spence, for the Spence memorial committee.
She had to work from photographs, but has done
well all the same.
J. C. Williamson has undertaken to build a fine
new theatre on North Terrace, opposite the railway
station. Wakefield is to be the home of another
theatre; so we’ll have a decent dramatic bill-of-fare
in the future—or should have.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

The biggest and most beautiful bicycle illustration
that has ever appeared in any cycle catalogue in the
world, depicting in a variety of charming tints the
most perfect cvcle that has ever been constructed, is
a novelty which the Mead C'mle Company, of Liver-
pool, will send free to anyone who writes for a copy.
This mammoth cycle illustration is only one of many
striking features to be found in the Mead Cycle Com-
pany’s charming Coronation Souvenir. For example,
the front page alone presents a large size, hand-

CAUSE AND CURE
Of SCIATICA.
■+■
A Seymour Man's Experience
of Various Treatments.
Because Sciatica is a disease of the
Sciatic nerve, it has been found that the
best treatment is one that tends to put tlie
whole nervous system in a strong healthy
condition. Blisters and injections are some-
times used to ease the sharp shooting light-
ning pains in the hips and legs; but this
treatment is not regarded in any sense as a
cure. A cure can only be obtained by look-
ing to the cause of the complaint and re-
storing the nerves to their proper state of
tone. In addition to the tonic treatment,
resting the limbs in bed or on a couch as
much as possible helps in a cure.
Mr. William Patterson, of Emily Street,
Seymour, Victoria, had a bad attack of
Sciatica, and declares that Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills cured him, and nothing else.
This is because they are a blood builder and
nerve tonic, the new blood they make, nour-
ishing the irritated inflamed nerve, thus
completely removing the cause of the com-
plaint, and making a permanent cure.
“Some time back I was employed fencing
at a place called Glenoura, about IS miles
from Seymour,” said Mr. Patterson to a
reporter, “when I was suddenly attacked by
sciatica. It was so bad I had to get another
man to take my place. In about a week I
was unable to walk about. The pain in-
creased in severity, and used to keep moving
right up to my hip. About three or four in
the morning it used to get very bad. The
Sciatic nerve in my left leg got very tender
to the touch. At times I could not move my
leg. The pain in the back of the thigh was
fearful. It was as if red hot needles were
being pushed into my sinews. I consulted
the doctor, and he said I was suffering from
a very bad attack of Sciatica. I tried lini-
ments, but they did me no good. I was in a
very bad state, unable to walk or work,
when my brother Henry told me of someone
that he knew who had suffered something
like myself being cured by Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills. I was only too glad to try any-
thing that was likely to give me ease from
my sufferings. The first box didn’t seem to
do me much good, but I continued their use
until I had used about six boxes, and then I
was able to go to work again, and have had
no relapse since. My occupation is such
that if the pills had not completely cured
me I am sure 1 wrnuld have had a relapse.”
When you want Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
don’t be put off with anything else said to
be just as good. If you have trouble in get-
ting them send direct to the Dr. Williams
Medicine Co. of Australasia Ltd., Sydney,
who will send them by return, post free,
2s. 9d. for one box, six boxes 15s. 3d.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“T.T.”: Stead’s “Interview with the
Prime Minister of Australia” starts with a
“howler” of some weight. Says Stead: “Mr.
Fisher is the first working-man to attain to
the position of a Prime Minister as the head
of a Labor Cabinet.” What was Watson?
What was Price ? What was Andy Dawson ?
A man in Mexico started a revolution last
week with 20 men. That was Private En-
terprise. Then 10 deserted. That was a
strike. Then the Federal troops chased the
other 10 like fury. That was Collectivism.
Finally, the 10 ran like Sheol for the U.S.
border. That was capital leaving the
country.
Yass, up against the Federal Capital site,
is booming. It is only necessary to read the
papers to see how far the place is ahead of
the Old World towns for excitement and
gaiety. Last week, a man who had attended
a funeral at Yass pulled two young rabbits
and a snake out of a burrow in the ceme-
tery.
Long before the shindy in Tripoli deve-
loped into war there was a rush to with-
draw money, and the Bank of Egypt doubled
up like a wet rag. It was 55 years old, and
used to pay 14 per cent, dividends, and most
people assumed that it was as solid as the
Pyramids. One is apt to wonder how the
Australian Government’s paper money re-
serve will look when it is this country in-
stead of Tripoli that is served with a sudden
ultimatum. That is a bank where every
blessed copper of liability is payable on de-
mand, for the Fisher Government was so
careful to follow the advice of all its worst
enemies that it took no measures at all to
keep its notes in circulation. And, when the
great demand comes, that will be just the
time when there will be such a heap of other
demands that gold will be as hard to get as
dragons’ eggs.
The curse of congestion came home to
roost in Sydney’s cupboard again last week,
when the master-carriers put up their rates
all round, and explained that they had to do
it because, being so often stuck up and wedged
in, a team couldn’t get through anything
like as much work as it used to. Said the
boss-carriers’ spokesman: “Where we could
depend upon a team to shift 10 tons a day a
few years ago, we can only count upon it
moving six or seven tons now.” Everything
has to be dragged to Sydney, and, as the
railways only carry a very small proportion
of the goods to the wharves, even the stuff
that is to be shipped has to be hauled
through a few narrow and mostly-crooked
streets, where it gets in the tvay of the other
stuff that is intended for local consumption;
and as, even if the beasts could step over
one another, they couldn’t drag their load of
potatoes or wool with them, they just have
to wait till the crowd melts, and waiting
costs money; and then the fool-public, which
wanted one bloated city, gets annoyed be-
cause its wife tells it that everything is
dearer, and it will have to put up with one
chop for breakfast.
Some astonishing
figures have been
produced by Beeby,
the new Lands
Minister in N. S.
Wales, concerning
the reputedly-suc-
cessful working of
the Fat party’s
scheme for settling
people on the land,
by the simple pro-
cess of buying the
big landlord out.
The harde r the
Wade Government
bought, the wider
its friend Fat opened
his mouth ; -and the
wider he opened his
mouth, the more
impossible it be-
came for the new
settler to pay his
instalments of pur-
chase money and
make a do of
things. Heaven only
knows what would
have happened un-
der droughty condi-
tions, but, even
with good seasons
to help them, 780
out of the 1038
settlers have so far
declared that they
can’t come up to the scratch with their in-
stalment money, and have applied to the
Government for “time.” And in practically
every case the Government has had to grant
it or risk seeing the whole beautiful scheme
go to smash.
Apropos the driving of capital out of the
country, it is mentioned that Victoria now
owes £7,230,285 less of public debt in Eng-
land than it did 10 years ago. Its total
debt has increased, but not only has all the
new loan money been raised in Victoria, but
enough has been raised ' there to convert
quite a heap of foreign debt into local debt.
In other words, the Government has driven
£7,230,285 of capital out of Victoria, and
that place feels better for the loss.
The Foreign-trade party has poor luck
these days. For years and years people like
Reid and Bruce Smith were amazed at the
great Freetrade revival they observed in
Victoria, and then, in the midst of their
amazement, Federation came to passT" and
N.S.W. became Protectionist. The Free-
trade upheaval in the U.S. has been ex-
pected every minute for 40 years or so, and
it hasn’t come. Then there was great joy
because Laurier, the Canadian Prime Minis-
ter, who was supposed to have Freetrade
leanings though ire practised Protection
rather than lose his job, was taking steps
towards “breaking down the tariff wall.”
But Canada thought it saw Laurier fooling
with the tariff wall, and threw Lim out amid
general execrations. So the Frefetrade re-
vival is postponed again.
THE LIBERTY OF THE “ LIBERAL. ”
The Liberal League at Stuart Town is greatly surprised at Mr. Willis’s action in accepting the
Speakership. He was always treated like a gentleman when member for this electorate. If he dare's
to show his face in Stuart Town he shall be hanged like a dog. —A recent frenzied spasm.
The hindmost figure in this work of art represents a sincere gentleman of the "Liberal"
breed. He is very, very busy, indeed—demonstrating his Solemn Objection to the Tyranny
and Violence of Political Unions, etc.
“Saltbush”: Premier McGowen, replying
to a question of Hoyle, M.P., re the advisa-
bility of giving able Australians, as far as
possible, all the high positions offering in
the public service, shuffled as follows: —
I have always expressed the opinion—and I hold
it more strongly now than ever —that it is the duty
of the Government in every department to give pre-
ference to Australians, all other things being equal.
And while it is possible to obtain men to fill the
highest positions in the countrrq I shall always give
first consideration to the Australian.
Yet, it was announced publicly, months ago,
that an Inspector of Secondary Schools
would be selected by the Education Director
in the Cold Country. No Australian got a
show, and no Labor members protested. No
wonder Wild Wood jeered.
TWO TALES.
FIRST.
LIBERAL : “ Yah, why don’t yer
carry out yer platform, wot
yer was elected on?”
SECOND.
LIBERAL : “ O-o-o-h!! Red-
rag Socialism! Just root
I said they'd do. ”
Joe Cook, in horror at the Fisher Govern-
ment’s preference-to-Unionists proposals :
Furthermore, unionists would be restricted to the
particular sphere of their unions. If a member of
the Carters’ Union applies for a laborer’s job, for
which a member of the Laborers’ Union is an appli-
cant, would he get it?
Well, seeing that if the Government adver-
tised for a laborer, it would probably want a
laborer, and not a carter, perhaps he wouldn’t.
Presumably, when Joe himself has tooth-
ache he rings up a chiropodist, and when his
house catches fire he sends the lamest per-
son he can find to the wood-and-coal mer-
chant’s.
Poor old Bruce Smith is in trouble again.
It is the job of his life to get into the lime-
light as the great Imperialist of these parts ;
but, whenever he does anything extra-Imp-
perial, he nearly always has the bitterness of
presently hearing the British Imperialists
denounce his view as anti-imperial—as, for
instance, over the Dreadnought insanity, and
the question of an Australian navy. Lately,
on the Address-in-Reply, Smith broke out
into a glorification of the Canadian Laurier
—“the greatest statesman outside the United
Kingdom”—whose views Smith remarked
had the virtue of being identical with his
own. But the Imperial Smith hadn’t quite
finished speaking before Canada huraned
Laurier out with a terrific bump, on the
ground that he was an enemy of the Empire,
and a distinguished commentator explained
that it was “Rule Britannia!” which had
cooked the Canadian's goose.
Last Thursday, Morton, M.L.A., urged
N.S.W. Works Minister Griffith to do some-
thing for Jamberoo, in his (Morton’s) own
electorate. Morton is on the side which the
Sydney Telegraph supports, and this was
the Telegraph’s description of its friend
Morton:—
Mr. Griffith: Have you got coal mines working
there ?
Mr. Morton said they had not, but it would be a
splendid spot to start a State coal mine.
Mr. Griffith: If Mr. Morton turns Socialist, I
don’t know what will happen.
Mr. Morton : I will always be a Socialist, so far
AS 11Y OWN DISTRICT IS CONCERNED.
Now the question arises: Does Morton, the
professed anti-Socialist, believe Socialism is
good, and does he want it all for his own
district? In other words, is he so wicked
fkat he wants to deprive all the rest of
N.S.W. of the Socialistic blessing? That
would seem to imply that his anti-Socialism is
a fraud, and that he is a public enemy, except
in his own district. Or does he believe So-
cialism is a curse, and does he hate his own
district so much that he wants it to be especi-
ally cursed? That would suggest that his
electorate had better get another member.
The Fat Person who warned Australia
tnat it would kill “the great wool-growing
industry if it adopted the progressive land
tax, made a mess of that prophecy like the
others. Nowadays, only a shade over 10 per
cent, of the Ma State’s ladies and gentlemen
who grow overcoats for other people are in
of 00,000 or over, and last year alone
the flocks of 10,000 and over decreased by 26.
*et, though in 10 years the flocks of 10,000
and over have lost 3,000,000 hleaters, the
little man’s flocks have grown so much in
numbers that the Ma’s aggregate is 51 mil-
uDS , a h ea d the 1900 figures. It looks as
though the big landlord didn’t even know how
to grow mutton, and that was always reck-
oned his strong suit.
One of Australia’s passing misfortunes is
an imported Quaker named (Jorder, who goes
around assuring the community that com-
pulsory military training is “a slavery to
which no British race has ever submitted,”
and such-like observations. And the honest,
fair-minded pagan who reads this sort of
stuff can only wonder once more why these
holy men have such a shameless disregard
for facts. The chief reason for the contempt
whicu the decent man of the world feels for
the advertising Christian arises from the
tact that the advertising Christian seems to
have a habit of inventing his information as
he goes along.
“Galleryite”: The brand of the coming
man is on James Scullin, who, on April 13,
romped in for Corangamite (Vic.). llis
speech on Deakin’s censure motion was in-
teresting and nearly maddened the affable
Alfred of Ballarat. He also did some deadly
bowling at the wicket of Joke Cook. This
particular ball shattered all Joke’s stumps:
In 1904 Hansard records the following utterance
of the hon. member for Parramatta:—
Mr. Cook: When I was secretary to a trade union
we always insisted on preference to unionists, and in
a very summary fashion.
Mr. Crouch : What was the union ?
Mr. Cook : The Coal Miners’ Union. We had no
difficulty in doing that, and I am free to tell the
hon. member that if I were in the same position to-
day I should do the same again. ... If I were in
that position again I should adopt the same attitude.
I will have no sort of sympathy with the man who
will work alongside another man, and see that other
man paying every week of his life into an organisa-
tion to protect his rights and to maintain his posi-
tion, whilst he himself is skulking and deriving the
benefit for which the other is paying and working.
And, nowadays, Cook almost chews the fur-
niture with rage when he suspects the Minis-
try of wanting to give preference to union-
ists.
WAR!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The recent Moroccan 'difficulty has made it evident
that the great wars of the future will be fought out
by financiers. —Daily paper.
The discount trembles, and the Bourse is shaken,
Our smitten credit reels athwart the field.
Securities their furious banks have taken,
Threaten the shares we never meant to yield.
Spent and forlorn, the coin that used to rattle
On fifty thousand counters of our land,
Forsakes our banners in the midmost battle,
Where, with dishonored cheque, we make our
stand.
On! On! Brave scrip, although the stocks are
falling!
Advance the greatness of our I O U
The vast red bullion set for our appalling,
Breaks at the golden sign of some brave Jew.
Millions are gone, and millions more shall follow;
Terrific onslaughts shake the Stock Exchange,
Where raging credit credit seeks to swallow,
The duns of vast reserve have found the range.
What warrior stays to dream of wine or roses?
What patriot thinks of mother, home or hash?
A nation’s hopes are centred all on Moses,
The bulwark of our valor and our cash.
No more with bayonet and sword we caper ;
The pen is mightier than the lance’s thrust;
We smite the foeman with our warlike paper,
And harry all his pawnshops till he’s bu’st!

A FAMILY REMEDY.
SAYS A COBAR LADY WHO FOUND
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
EFFECTIVE FOR INDIGESTION
AND HEADACHES.
No remedy ever placed before the public
has ever been so fully taken into the confi-
dence of all classes as has Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills. They are essentially a Family
Remedy for the little Ills of Life, and if taken
when feeling out of sorts many of the big
ills will be kept away. Mrs. R. A. Dunn,
Bloomfield Street, Cobar, N.S.W., writes: —
. “Some time ago, being a sufferer from In-
digestion and Headache arising therefrom,
I decided to give Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills a trial. After taking a few pills I
found a decided improvement, and can re-
commend Indian Root Pills for a speedy
recovery from that complaint. I _ have
found them also a good family medicine for
common ills with children. _ You have my
consent to use this testimonial.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Though Jack Lester, “the heavyweight
champion of the British Empire,” to give him the
title under which he was announced, was soundly
larruped and plainly outclassed by darky Sam McVea,
“the champion of Europe,” at the McStadium, Sydney,
on Saturday night, he did all that was expected of
him by the majority of those interested in the argu-
ment, according to the Book of Queensberry. In-
deed, by staying the 20 rounds and saving a knock-
out, he did a good deal more. Whether he could
have done it had the colored gent, felt in better
fighting trim, is another question altogether. To
this paper it is clear that he could not —as clear as
the footprints of the Devil on the stairway to the
choir loft. But the argument that McVea, in the
kindness of his heart, deliberately allowed his raw
opponent to go the full distance, doesn’t seem to
count for much unless Me is a very much less astute
person than _he is given credit for. Certainly his
reputation isn’t as big as it was the day before this
crude, practically unknown youngster faced him for
20 rounds, and came out with a bleeding nose and
a swollen jaw. On the other hand, Lester’s mana
will soar a good deal, even if it does come down
with a wallop well and truly delivered by the next
black star that blazes at the Stadium. The fact
seems to have been that Sam’l, coming off a long
voyage and not having proper time or inclination to
train, was not anxious to risk petering out his steam
by battering with undue energy at a stranger who
might (1) refuse to be knocked out; (2) be led to
do some knocking out on his own account if there
were any tired niggers in the vicinity. The result
was that, to a large extent, McVea was in leash a
good part of the night, and, in the writer’s opinion,
anyhow, was mistakenly charged with “not trying”
by quite a number of people.
The 20,000 folk who put in their evening watch-
ing the one-sided battle got their money’s worth, if
only in having it made clear to them that the white
man’s game is not slugging his fellow-man these
times, unless said fellow-man is an unprotected
Speaker of Parliament, and there is a bottle handy.
There is not much room to doubt that Lester is the
best white stoush purveyor in the world to-day ; yet
from the first to the last round on Saturday night
he was practically a punching-bag, and never looked
anything else. Nevertheless, it was inspiring to see
the grit of the man and the stubbornness of the
purpose that carried him safely through ; even when,
finding him weak and disorganised, the big, ani-
mated mass of bronze stormed down upon him and
shook him to the limit of endurance. Twice that
happened—in the 14th and 17th rounds —and the
wild cheers that followed the white man as he was
still going at gong-time showed how the crowd felt
about it. And, after “Snowy” Baker had given his
decision, the cheerful descendant of the original
nigger gave him the glad word that cheers, and is
liable to inebriate the young mind. He earned it.
Throughout, McVea almost entirely depended upon
his left hand, and certainly it appeared to be the
exact kind of instrument for the job or jab. He
used it with equal freedom to hook, stab or upper-
cut, and sent it into action almost as rapidly as a
cat darting its front hoof at a mouse. The right is
apparently a reserve force with the black man, which
would seem to be a matter for hearty congratulation
to anybody who is of a different opinion than its
proprietor. One is enough at a time. Those who
doubt this can take Lester’s word for it if his
memory is recalled to the thirteenth round, when he
received a wallop from the reserve implement that
nearly knocked the iron shutter off his jaw. For the
rest, McVea will no doubt exhibit his full bag of
tricks when he meets Langford and Johnson (if that
much-advertised pug arrives here), and it ought to
be worth seeing. Perhaps when the exhibition is on,
the Mclnsplosh will make an effort to allow the
public to pay him the price of admission without
battering like frenzied lunatics trying to escape
through the kevhole of a burning asylum.
* * * *
There is a rumor in Gath, which is on the
borders of Philistia, that Tahmmy Burns has been
training almighty hard for the last 10 months, and
is now in the first flush of rejuvenation. He is on
his way to Australia, and, so the whisper runs,
will challenge Jack Johnson, whether that dark, tall
gentleman emerges from his various dust-ups a cham-
pion or not. Mere smoke, gentlemen, mere smoke!
* * * *
Jack Lester, who travelled the thorny way
with McVea the other night, is singularly like Burns,
and there is a queer yarn to the effect that he is
Tahmmy’s youngest brother, and that the recent
legal proceedings are all part and parcel of a scheme
to disguise the fact, and advertise the stripling.
One never knows what these advertisers will get up
to next, but it is certainly a tall yarn. If it be
true, it suggests that Tabmmy should have started
life as a sensational novelist, and that someone was
saved a heap of trouble by the fact that he was not
born a woman.
* * * *
Quite accidentally, it is said, they have
found out a way to make Lester able to beat any
champion—black, white or red. The yarn goes, that
while his trainer was pouring some fresh ammonia
into 1 a large bottle of embrocation, someone bumped
his elbow, and the freezing liquid splashed over
Lester in a raw state and in a large quantity. With an
awful yell Lester arose, and next minute the room
was a wreck. Trainer, sparring partners, the press
and a few others had been laid low and gwept out.
After remaining in hiding for half an hour or so, they
ventured back, and found Lester as calm as could be
expected. So when Lester fights Johnson, Tahmmy,
at the psychological moment, will throw ammonia at
him from behind, and then Johnson’s dismembered
corpse will be hurled among the audience.

In a blaze of heat Dave Smith and Jack
Howard fought the good fight at Sydney Sports
Ground on Labor’s Day forenoon, in the presence of
4000 or 5000 members of various religious denom-
inations. Both men were weighed in the balance at
the ring-side, and found wanting beyond the 12st.
71b. limit, so no forfeits were called. The racket
was conducted by Smith for the major portion of the
nine rounds it lasted, although there were times
when he seemed as if he would sooner have been
relieved by Sam McVea, Irving Sayles, or some other
of the more skilled battlers present. Howard was
too slow throughout, particularly when, bashing the
great Smith family’s delegate with much vigor
in the early rounds, he had him (Smith) shifting
scenery with considerable rapidity. Once in the
fourth round, instead of following Smith with every
wallop in his repertoire, he stopped and waited for
the wilting man to have a breather and come back.
But at no time did Howard look a winner. He
cannot stand the punishment his slow, rather old-
fashioned, style demands, and when Smith bored
in and battered with right and left, like a threshing
machine trying to force its way into the last pub
at five minutes past 11 p.m., he was helpless. After
the fifth round, during which he was dropped with a
flying swing, Howard faded rapidly, although, in the
following lap, after receiving more trouble than
Delilah passed to Sampson, he banged a woodener to
Smith that nearly carried away his upper deck.
The eighth round practically saw the end of the
row, and early in the ninth Howard was sent
down twice. On the second occasion the police
stayed the inevitable.
The Spring meeting opened on Saturday
with about as glorious a day as the Creator ever
handed out of His weather-factory. When the horses
went to the post, the 10s. crowd not only filled all
the stands, but overflowed on to the grass in front
thereof, in such numbers as to practically obscure it
from the view of the passing air-fowl. It is clear
that if racing continues to grow in popularity as it
has been doing of late, more viewing accommodation
will need shortly to be provided ; that failing, some-
thing will burst. The sap-headed section of the
populace which goes to Randwick with the object of
separating the Ring from its gold, didn’t go home in
the cheery, complacent mood in which it arrived.
Not by yards. All the alleged good things went
wrong. One of the nearest approaches to a favorite
was Adrian Knox’s Crown Grant (five to one), the
winner of the Trial Stakes, in which event Duke
Foote had started at nine to four on. Five to
four was laid on Comedy King for the Spring Stakes,
despite the fact that he looked his worst. Aurofo-
dina won from Malt King with some ease. With
Cisco, a 14 to one chance taking the Derby, and
Volsloane (20 to one) the Epsom, the average
backer’s cup of misery brimmed over, and the ano-
dyne Beer was sought in barrels.
The doubt and uncertainty that hang
about a field of 28, disappeared almost immediately
the Epsom lot got going. Volsloane, the winner, and
Bandon Lad, the third horse, were in the front bunch
to the half-mile, and thence they led the field right
up to the distance. It was not till half-way down
the straight that Didus came with an almighty rush
and passed Bandon Lad, but made no impression on
Volsloane, which won by a length. Lady Medallist,
the favorite, which, when money was accepted,
started at three to one against, practically dropped
out before the race was much more than half
over. Cisco’s win was another case of almost
a straight run through. The way the noble steed
ran made it plain that he could have led the field
over the whole course, instead of the two-thirds he
was allowed to. The only solace the punter had was
that in the Derby he received an excellent run for
his money, for Jacamar, which carried the public
wealth, made a game run that must have caused the
heart of the bagman to stand absolutely still.
On Monday, at least, some of the punters
recovered a little of their own from Benjamin
Short-Odds. That person was unable to stem the
rush that set in on Malt King for the Metropolitan
during the last few minutes. O’Brien’s handsome
horse went out loaded with a fairish swag of the
public money, at five to one against, though possibly
Didus and Lady Medallist carried equal swags. The
layers treated the Lady with contempt, and laid 10
to one against her recklessly to the finish. Didus
and Malt King were even in the betting till the rush
on the King started, when Didus eased somewhat.
For six furlongs the pace was a flier, and the favor-
ites galloped along within striking distance. Then
the pace-makers cracked right up, and the field
settled into a nice easy stride, which promised a
fearsome rush at the finish. It came, but the
velocity of the beginning had played the deuce with
Flava, Piastre, and Lady Medallist. Malt King
showed no signs of distress, but sailed up on the
outside, and won easily for the last 100yds., in 2min.
35isec., the slowest time since 1902.

The mugs who back horses were urged
by the horse scribes, of late, to go to sundry pre-
liminary meetings like Rosehill and Hawkesbury,
and get some idea how to place their money in the
A.J.C. Spring Meeting. Thousands of them went,
and as regards the Epsom and Derby, a fat lot thej
got out of it. Cisco, which annexed the Derby,
went out at 14 to one against, and Voisloane,
winner of the Epsom, started at 20 to one against.
N.S.W. owners pocketed all the prize-money
at Randwick on the first day of the A.J.C. Spring meet-
ing, and the owners from other States had to be con-
tent with counter-lunch for supper. Of the last 21
Derbys, 16 were won by the Ma State, three by
Victoria, and two by Maoriland. The distribution
of the Epsom prize-money has also been very one-
sided, 20 having gone to Walers and one to Vic-
toria. Ma’s grabbing in horse-racing would suggest
that racing men control its policy in Federal affairs.
The cinder driving-track on Richmond
(Vic.) racecourse, on Saturday, was the scene of the
second 10-mile track championship (for Victoria)
ever held in Australasia, and some 8000 persons wit-
nessed the canter. In the first race, on the Malvern
Cricket Ground, just 11 years ago, George Blake ran
home 500yds. ahead of his field in 56min. 57isee.,
which stood an Australasian record till Saturday.
Blake himself, Connor, and other notables, were ab-
sent ; but Emil R. Voight and nearly 100 others
started, the Olympic five-mile champion making the
pace a rush. He cut out the first mile in smin.
3 2-ssec., and at two miles (lOmin. 15sec.) led by
25yds. from W. Murray and E. Neate, of Carlton.
The fourth mile post he passed, still well ahead, in
21min. 4 4-ssec., but soon afterwards a sinew of his
leg gave way, he slowed down, and finally stopped.
After that. Murray mostly took the field along till
he reached the winning-post, some 150vds. ahead of
Neate, with Ryan (East Melbourne Harriers) a few
yards away, third. Time, 56min. 30sec., is a Vic-
torian and Australasian record.
The very last, final, ultimate act in Mel-
bourne’s ’oofball comedy transpired out at Northcote
on Saturday, when the Port Melbourne and ’Roy
Juniors decided the ownership of this season’s Junior
Ass. pennant. The episode was only redeemed from
insignificance by reason of the discourtesy of the
players and the lack of self-control shown by the
barrackers. The chief advantage of this ground is
that it boasts a large and well-stocked—er—hostelry
adjacent, where there is ample accommodation for the
losers to drown their disgust, and the victors to
swim in whisky, and mostly they rush the accommo-
dation. Wherefore, things get “willing,” and Satur-
day was no exception, though nobody was actually
assassinated, nor was the ambulance requisitioned.
But the force had a busy time persuading the sup-
porters of Port Melbourne—last year’s premiers—to
accept the scorer’s decision of —“Port, in noi-tR to
’Roy’s 41,” and it was quite late before the last dis-
putant was bundled on a tram and hunted out of
the township. There is no laissez-faire about these
junior ’bailers.
* ♦ * *
Walking does not seem to be a common
accomplishment in the Ma State, if one can judge by
the ease with which J. J. Harley, of South Sydney
Harriers, downed his field in the one-mile walk
championship of N. S. Wales, at Moore Park, Syd-
ney, on Saturday. To begin with, only half a dozen
faced the starter, and Harley just tramped away, and
left them plodding helplessly. At the end of the
first lap he was 7yds. in front, and at the end of
the second he was 12yds. Then his lead began to
grow like the price of the horsesmith’s nails, and he
wandered in on his lonesome, with the second man
some 70yds. behind, done to a turn. Harley stepped
over the distance in 7min. 9 2-ssec.
At the same meeting, H. S. McNeill, of
the University A. C., took advantage of the three-
quarter-mile open handicap to attack the undefended
record for the distance. He made a succession of
brilliant spurts, and finally accomplished his fell
purpose in 3min. 23 l-ssec., chipping l-10thsec. off
the previous effort.

The cabled news of seven wickets for five
runs, by King, of Leicestershire, in August, turns
out to have hardly done him justice. ' That particular
feat was done three times before, by Grace and
Mold long ago, and last year by young J. W. Hearne,
•who is coming out with Warner. The special feature
of King’s destructiveness is that the seven wickets
reallv fell for no runs. In his first 2i overs, five were
scored off him. Then he found his length, and
another 4£ overs—all runless —finished off the York-
shire innings.
Saturday saw the opening of Grade
Cricket in Sydney, under weather conditions that
can be described only as elysian. The feature of the
day was the downfall of the Ancients who, in the
trial matches the previous Saturday, had given such
golden promise. The great M. A. Noble was wiped
out for two. The mighty Victor Trumper was clean
bowled for eight. Macartney vanished for seven.
Bardsley collapsed for 18. The rain on Friday had
left a dirty wicket behind it in most cases, but the
fact remains that some of the dimmer lights man-
aged to hit up very respectable scores notwithstand-
ing. Barbour and Fisher, of University, compiled
77 apiece, and B. B. Minnett and Lane, of the
same club, left 53 and 59 on the scoring board
respectively. The rest of the side totalled 320.
Sayle, of Noble’s own club, put up 96, and Trumper
had the mortification of seeing three of his colts
accumulate 73 among them. Nobody struck a cen-
tury, but the batting of a lot of the youngsters was
decidedly good.
* * * *
The first round of cricket came to an end
on Labor Monday, and the winners, with one excep-
tion, stood revealed as a one-innings crowd. Glebe
defeated Burwood by five runs ; Waverley smashed
up Sydney by 250 runs; University downed North
Sydney by 16 runs ; and Redfern walloped Padding-
ton by 22 runs. The exception was Central Cumber-
land’s win over Gordon, which went under by an
innings and 20 runs, having accumulated 239 against
C.C.’s 261 for nine wickets. R. V. Minnett, of
North Sydney, accumulated the only century Of the
day, being caught when at 106. There was some
dandy bowling, as when Dupain, of Burwood, took
five Glebe wickets for 13 runs. Altogether it was a
promising day, and the colts are doing beautifully,
thank you.
* * * *
S. Aus. Cricket Association promises the
public various reforms at the Adelaide Oval. Two of
them are well in hand—a £l4OO up-to-date scoring-
board, and the moving of the picket-fence down to
the edge of the grass. Track-cycling has long been
dead, and this fence-shifting buries it so far as the
oval is concerned. The track—claimed to be the
finest in Australia —now makes a good sloping van-
tage-ground for spectators right round. A much-
needed drive from the back of the ground is to be
ready by test-match time in January; and a stand
for members only is talked of. Members, who now
number over 1000, complain that under present con-
ditions ladies won’t allow them elbow room.
Major Philip Trevor, who managed the
last English team in Australia, discusses the per-
sonnel and the prospects of the next, which he is
not going to manage. In batting it is “infinitely
stronger” ; _ in bowling it is not in any way
stronger; in fielding it “does not excel.” The
Major thinks the new men may be disconcerted by
the barracking of the Australian crowds —“plain
speaking is the characteristic of young countries.”
Australian batsmen are used to it; “they face the
music better than English batsmen.” The Major
warmly eulogises Noble as a captain—his “unde-
featable resolution and marvellous judgment”—and
thinks Australia has lost a valuable asset by his re-
tirement.
* * * *
The send-off to “Plum” Warner and his
English XI was so hearty last week that, in the
crush, sharpers relieved the captain of his watch and
the tickets of the team. People who study these
things say it is an omen of the very best import, so
Clem Hill and Victor Trumper are hereby counselled
to kill a Chinaman for luck.
Melbourne Cricket Club’s reward to Major
Wardill for his efforts in holding the bridge in the
club’s early days is a yearly pension of £4OO. So
the genial old Major will bat on an easy wicket for
the rest of his days; and, judging by his appearance,
his days are likely to be long in the club he has
made.

Died on Saturday, John Jennings, who
filled the caretakership of Sydney Cricket Ground for
25 years. Jennings took the ground ’neath his wing
when the strip of earth was very close to a wilder-
ness ; and the present tip-top aspect of the enclosure
shows the hard labor which was put into it by the
departed enthusiast. If the green pastures on the
other side need attention, John Jennings will not
find it hard to get a job, and will fill the position
with credit.
At the Adelaide Hunt Club races, Tom
Walls—“ Peter Doody,” of the Arcadians co. at the
Royal—had a mount in the Ladies’ Bracelet. Some-
thing went wrong with his stirrup, and, like Peter
in the play, he “nearly got third.” The Hunt Cup
was won by Jack Adams, an old hunter by Harm-
ouist-Countess, of Victorian breeding.
The Sydney Flying Squadron and Sailing
Club amalgamated to make a mighty display on the
waters of Port Jackson (N.S.W.) for the opening
day of the season. And they did it. A finer array
of boats splendidly handled would be hard to see
anywhere on earth. As a procession it was a boom-
ing success, but as a race it was a farce. No less
than 17 started, but for some reason or another,
probably the mildness of the breeze, there was no
devil in the fight. And people like a lot of devil in
the fight these days. When there’s no devil there’s
really no fight at all.
* * * *
It seems more than possible that N.S.W.
Bowling Association will yet achieve a happy issue
out of all its troubles. The rush for the back door
that marked each effort to secure officials has been
stemmed, and a working team with some energy has
started to push the old machine along. The country
clubs are to be allowed to trundle a chance for the
Pennant, and the innovation threatens to instil life
into a somewhat jaded sport.
The Wowsers of Maoriland would appear
to have given up sly-drinking and taken to horse-
racing. At Marton, in the North Island, and a one-
nag town at that, _ the machine recently broke down
in the effort to swallow the money rammed into it.
No less than £20,063 was shoved though in a day,
and the perspiring officials understood their thirst
when they totted up, and found that the previous
year they had taken only £10,632 on the same day,
and that the jump represented nearly 100 per cent,
increase.
Dick Arnst recently experienced the emo-
tions which hit the Archangel Michael when a bull-
ant invited him to leave his halo behind him, and
step forth and put ’em up. Maoriland sculler Steven-
son dropped in a challenge to race him over five
miles of the Parramatta River for his blessed cham-
pionship. But Arnst was saved by the fact that the
championship rules limit the race to not less than
three, or more than four and a-half miles. Still,
no doubt, if the bull-ant puts up the money, Michael
will step down and oblige.
* * * *
When old Jake Gaudaur retired to Rat
Portage, in the woods of Canada, and refused to
row anywhere else for the championship, or allow
any expenses, or do anything to facilitate the match
that Towns was eagerly seeking, Australian papers
said it was fairly rotten sport. Now Dick Arnst
announces that he will not go to England to row
Barry, unless the latter puts up £lOOO for expenses.
Richard is making money in business in Sydney just
now, and can’t tear himself away from it, so de-
mands an exorbitant fee to choke” Barry, who is a
laboring man, right off. Truly, he says that if
Barry comes to Sydney he will allow him “fair
expenses,” but he says nothing to indicate that those
expenses will soar up to £lOOO. Somehow, Arnst’s
sport doesn’t smell too sweet.
The gilded success which hit the N.S.W.
Hugby League’s recent athletic venture has stirred
i continued action. Quite a multitude
of challenges are in the air on the promise of another
meeting, which will certainly be fixed up. The gem
that is waiting to be set at present is a 10-mile
gallop between R. Leitch, of South Australia, and
b. Ornstein, of Maoriland.
The s. A. football premiership provided
the bill of fare for 20,000 barrackers last Saturday,
when West Adelaide jumped on Port Adelaide by 53
points to 35. As minor premiers, the Ports will ex-
ercise their “challenge rights,” and have another
smack at Wests on the coming Saturday. Next
week, Essendon (Vic.) will roam over S. Australia,
and the premiers of the two States will have a dust-
U P ,l° T the Australian Rules football championship
ot the continent; after which S.A. will hurriedly don
its cricket togs to greet Warner’s wandering band.
-Australian Rugby League team
( Kangaroos”) has, thusfar, had a successful run in
England, and won the first three matches bv 20
points to 11, 33 to 13, and 18 to eight. The 71
points scored are represented by 19 tries and seven
goals, and the poor percentage of converted tries
makes the loss of a booter of the ability of Messenger
an extremely big item.
(Continued on page 30.)
The wholesale distributors for that philan-
thropic concern, the great C. 5.11. octopus,
lately issued a circular “under the agency
conditions relating to the buying and selling
of the above co.’s products.” The business
part ran this way:—
Orders booked for forward delivery can only ;be
accepted subject to prices ruling on date of execu-
tion, and, in the event of an advance in price, the
undelivered portion of the booking is subject to the
advanced price, although no alloirance is made on
stocks held at the date of a fall in price.
And the gigantic concern, which plays this
game of “heads I win, tails you lose,” is the
same which recently asked Australia to be-
lieve that, whatever else it was, it was the
very essence of fairness, and quite incapable
of using its monopoly for the purpose of
taking advantage of any little mean points.
“State interference” has just been obliged
to report some more shocking things about
itself. The Ma State’s friendly societies
were fine samples of unrestricted Private
Enterprise, a few years ago, and, as such,
they furnished the members with no end of
excitement —nobody ever was sure whether
his sick pay wouldn’t have to be cut down
by one-half, as it actually was in many
cases, or whether the widow would be able
to collect the funeral money when she called
for it. Then, just when members were pro-
mised more excitement than they could stand,
the State interfered, and appointed a dull
official called an actuary, and said that
societies mustn’t promise to pay more than
this unromantic person found they actually
could pay. Five years ago he found that the
societies couldn’t pay more than 16s. 7d. in
the fof their “funeral fund” promises; after
five years of “interference” they can, he
finds, now pay 225. Id. And the ultimate
sickening result of this and a dozen other
improvements is that the societies’ members
have increased by 36.329 in five years, and
now number 132,922 —132,922 people who
have been robbed of their manly independence
and have surrendered the right of every free-
born Briton to let his wife go to the wash-
tub in order to pay the family’s doctor’s bill.
The Howard-Smith proprietary has won
another trick in the apparently interminable
game of litigation over the proposed sale of
the steamer Peregrine to the Russian Go-
vernment at the time of the Russo-Jap
scrap. The sale fell through, and each party
has been furiously suing and pursuing the
other ever since. Yarawa, the Russian
agent, was temporarily on top when he was
awarded £5OOO as damages for false im-
prisonment (the Peregrine long ago dropped
out of the case). Later on, the shipping co.
trumped the trick with a successful appeal
to the Victorian Full Court, and followed it
up Dy beating Varawa on his appeal to the
High Court. There the Russ was outed
with costs, which by this time are flying so
high as to be quite out of gunshot.
Reflections of the Old Soldier
The explosion in Toulon Harbor provides another
powerful argument against big fighting ships. As re-
gards the science of naval construction and arma-
ment, the French are at least level with, and pro-
bably ahead of, the British, yet the chief naval
depot of France has been the scene of a series of
accidents, beginning with the blowing up of the
Jena, and ending with this, which really means a
loss almost equal to that which would have resulted
from a defeat in a general action. The horror of
many of these naval appliances is that they are so
little understood that no one really knows exactly
how they will behave in any given circumstances.
The French powder is known as “melinite,” practi-
cally the same thing as the British “lyddite,” a pre-
paration of phenol with nitric and sulphuric acids. It
has been used as an explosive for about 20 years,
and has established a reputation as hideously trea-
cherous stuff. It was used as a yellow dye for silk
and woollen for quite 30 years before it was proved
to be explosive. A fire had broken out in some
chemical works in Manchester, where picric acid, as
the dye was called, was prepared. It was running
melted along the gutters in the yard, and happened
to wander into a shed where there was a heap of
lead compound. This caused the melted picric acid
to explode and wreck everything. No one has yet
found out exactly what will happen to picric acid,
lyddite or melinite under some possible circum-
stances.

Somewhat relieved of liis Australian tan,
the Mclnstoush is back in Sydney in charge of his
Ruslicutter’s Bay Stadium. And there he will stay
till the shutters are put up for the winter, when he
will once more flit away to Europe, and thence to
the United States. For next season he will open in
New York, and his circuit will then extend from
New York to Paris and London, and then away to
Sydney. He will then be admittedly, as he is now
in reality, the world’s boss fight-promoter—but the
opening in New York will be his coronation, so to
speak. And all this he has done and won with
about two years of actual organising.
By his bewildering success he has done much to
advertise Australia, for in Europe and America he
is “the Australian promoter.” In those remote
regions he has established the belief that Australian
men are of the sort who do things, and do ’em big.
He found boxing in London a close preserve of the
National Sporting Club, a place structurally about
on a par with the Gaiety Sporting Club, Sydney, but
backed by the prestige and influence of the very
biggest people in the English capital. Fighting—
which was low, beastly low, anywhere else in London
—-was respectable at the National. A man would
boast of having been present at a bout in that august
establishment, but wore a disguise if he attended
one elsewhere. And when Mclntosh announced his
intention of butting in his best friends warned him
the task was hopeless. 1-Ie would lose his money
and wreck his reputation with a record failure. But
he set his teeth and butted in, and when the dust
cleared, the Mclntosh was seen standing, receiving
the thanks of dukes, earls and titled ladies for the
splendid time he had given them, and the delightful
surroundings of his “interesting display.” When the
magnificent private boxes at his annexe of the Olym-
pia accommodated people like Lords Kingston, Carn-
warth, Auckland, Howard de Walden and Torrington,
Baron Planitz, Rothschild, the Crown Prince of Ger-
many, Ladies Dillon, Constance Stewart-Richardson,
Mary Gordon-Lennox, and Mrs. Clement Scott, he
had succeeded in making boxing not only respect-
able, but fashionable. Where these people went, the
class which shells out the money in England could
go with impunity, and it went.
Paris had caught the boxing craze, and was
being fooled with brummy shows amid inele-
gant surroundings. Mclntosh appeared, and went
the whole hog. Commodious halls, excellent accom-
modation, refreshments for ladies, uniformed ushers
to bow the way, and big prizes which made the men
fight like fiends to bag the winner’s end, touched the
heart of Paris where it liked to be tickled. He was
the first man to take cinematograph pictures of a
fight in Paris, and 24 hours afterwards the pictures
of the scrap were being shown at almost every
picture-show in the French capital. But if he
loomed big in the eyes of the public, he loomed
bigger still in the eyes of the boxers, and there was
a rush to get in touch with him. Then he played
the master stroke that made him the Emperor of
Boxing. There is not a really prominent fighter in
the world to-day who is not now under contract to
the Australian promoter. Not a bad performance
for a young man who, only a few years ago, started
life in Sydney with no other capital than his pluck.
An interesting figure at the Lang-Lang-
ford scrap was that of the aged Lord Grenfell. (The
last fight he had seen was the Sayers-Heenan scrap
of somewhere about half a century before.) There
was a very swagger crowd there that night, the Duke
of Westminster and Lord Rothschild having no less
than seven seats each. Lane’s downfall was a great
shock to them for to a man they were in hopes that
the Briton from Over the Seas would down the
Yankee. Some of them afterwards inquired plaint-
ively how it was that England could not produce a
heavyweight champion nowadays. Mclntosh rec-
koned that problem was dead easy. “You nip your
champions in the bud,” he explained. “No sooner
does one of your men show promise than you rush
tiim up against the world’s best, instead of building
him up and taking him up step by step. He springs
from his first or second appearance to the top storey,
and gets eaten up by a man who has been through
the whole course stage by stage.” It was Mclntosh,
as a matter of fact, who started the agitation against
the Johnson-Wells disturbance. When he was asked
to arrange it as far back as February, he refused
point blank, on the grounds that Wells, being a mere
stripling and practically without experience, was not
a match for Johnson, either physically or in ring-
craft. He is most promising, but to put him
against Johnson is to expose him to a dog-walloping
which will destroy him as a fighter for ever. Very
few men ever come back after one real smashing.
The appearance of ladies (not lydies) at
fights in England, dates from the appearance of the
Mclntosh. And Mrs. Clement Scott wrote an article
demanding to know why men refused to allow their
women folk to watch glove contests. The dame
drew a eulogistic picture of the Apollos in the ring,
their muscles rippling under satiny skins, their per-
fect and beautiful figures, and then described the
average city man as he is in—er —his singlet and
underpants, and said it was very easy to understand
why men, married men especially, wished to keep
their wives away from boxing matches. Talk about
throwing dirt on the beard of the Lord of Creation!
There’s a fortune looming on the horizon
for any large-sized white youth who gets himself
trained as a stoush er nowadays. Joseph Robinson,
lit., of S’Africa, talks of giving £5OOO to any un-
colored person capable of taking down Johnson's
number, as tliouch that particular niggah were a
passing novelty, rather than the leader of a party
which will provide his successor when lie is blown
out. J.J. is nearing the end of his innings, anyhow.
The nigger that comes after him will be the one for
the white trash to beat, and if the champions of to-
morrow and thereafter are to be not black, the
money that Robinson and others would now give to
the aspiring Wells, if he earned it, must lie devoted
to the endowment of a school for white boxers,
where the annual distribution of prizes will make
every hunky kid’s mouth water. Something of this
sort seems bound to come. A lot of millionaires are
interested in the white v. black stoushing rivalry,
and a fund for the encouragement of young talent
could be raised forthwith.
Young Bombardier Wells has at least one
boxing characteristic in common with the champion
who is expected to make a fool of him. He stands
up to his work like a man and a Johnson. He
doesn’t crouch like a Burns or duck like a Lang, or
try to shuffle out of a difficulty.
Lord Lonsdale didn’t deserve a cable an-
nouncement of his noble dictum, that the inequality
of Johnson and Wells was proved by the fact that one
man got three times as much payment as the other.
Wells’s proposed share of the plunder was twice as
much as the darky earned by his victory over Tommy
Burns.
Exactly why the defeat of Jack Lester by
McVea, the son of Ham, should be hailed by the
press as the obliteration of another “hope”, is not
very clear. The negro with the Scotchbyterian name
is up among the world’s very best, and is regarded
by many as a likely man to wreck Johnson himself.
Yet this pugilistic kid Lester goes the whole way for
20 rounds, and avoids a knock-out. For, after all,
Lester is still in short skirts as far as professional
bruising is concerned, and hasn’t yet put his back-
hair up. It strikes an every-day sort of cove like
the _ writer that his performance is distinctly pro-
mising. No really candid person expressed any be-
lief that Lester would win. Now some people are
saying that McVea could have knocked him out at
any time during the fight; that it was prolonged
merely for the pictures ; that McVea didn’t want to
create any nasty impressions by banging the infant;
and that, anyhow, Mac is too good-hearted to bang
anyone unless he has to in self-defence. The answer
to all of which is “Rats!” Even McVea can’t afford
to create an impression that he is not giving the
public the best that is in him, and fight-followers
lust for the sight of a knock-out even as the drunk
does for a hair of the dog. And nothing makes a
picture fight go like a sudden and fearsome, blood-
curdling knock-out. McVea is too honest on his
past performances not to stun his brother-pug if he
gets the chance. The common-sense view of the
matter is that Lester has a dangerous wallop in
either hand, and to go in to finish him meant taking
beastly risks; also, that McVea, like Johnson, is not
nearly as powerful a hitter as he seems. All the
same, writer would much sooner he hit someone else.
A recent cable mentioned a “Boxers'
Union” in London, and the Sydney pug is beginning
to think it is a useful thing to have about the pre-
mises. Only a boxers’ union can prevent little epi-
sodes like that which happened at the Gaiety last
week, when referee Gannon, on behalf of the Gaiety
Club, disqualified for life J. Hill and E. Green.
That the exhibition was a bad one, and that Hill de-
served punishment, seems to be generally approved,
but there is a strong feeling that Green did not.
Hill hit at him, and then hung on like a Bathurst
burr, and if Green shoved him off it meant being
worn out by shoving, and having no strength left
for fighting. And what happened to Green may
happen to any other pug. Whether other manage-
ments will recognise the disqualification is a matter
of speculation, but the public will remember, and
the stigma is a heavy one for Green to carry. The
power that Speaker Willis holds in the N.S.W. As-
sembly is a trifle compared to the authority swung
by a stoush referee. What is wanted is somebody to
review these moral biffings, and decide if they have
been duly and properly earned. Then, if they have,
they can be made general, and if not, wiped out
altogether. As it is, Green, though generally re-
garded as blameless, can never fight at the Gaiety
again.
Bombardier Wells, the Englishman who
was to have met Jack Johnson in Paris, if the
Courts declared he could not do so in London, is a
fine youth of 22 years, and the most promising
fighter England has unearthed for a long time. But
neither in experience, strength or ring-craft is he a
match for the ophidian-headed one, and if the scrap
does come off it is a case of being butchered to
make a fancy purse for the bloated champion, and
selling his pugilistic birthright for a mess of coin.
Wells will get a good purse, of course, but he will
get nothing like sufficient compensation for the in-
jury a walloping from the big black will inflict on
his moral stamina. If the auriferous-mouthed person
rubs it in as he usually does when he gets the better
of a white man, the most probable result will be
the end of Wells’s career, for after a really thorough
slogging your professional bruiser becomes a cur at
heart.
N.S.W. lias only just got out of the bog
into which it fell in trying to solve what constituted
“a place,” and there seems imminent risk that, in the
near future, it will get bogged in a wild, furious
attempt to decide what is “a point.” During the last
week the papers have simply bristled with points.
As an instance, the S. M. Herald stated that
“Jacamar easily holds pride of place in the quota-
tions for the qlassic race, about a couple of points
in advance of Woolerina; Ladies’ Man is a couple
of points further back, and a point in front of
Posadas ; while the most prominent of the others are
three points away.” It may be Greek to the law-
abiding citizen, but there is a whisper that, among
the unregenerate, a “point” is a “quid,” which is
“one of the best” ; and, for the rest, that, by count-
ing the number of points from the tail to the front,
one arrives at the number of pounds the bookmakers
in the Pitt-street sly betting shops are laying against
the first mentioned. After that it is easy to get at
the rest. Of course, it may be only a myth, but it
is up to some proprietor to kindly mention what his
paper means when it winks the other eye and men-
tions “points.”

The fact that Senator Pearce,' in his De-
fence capacity, is taking an interest in the big
relay dispatch ride from Adelaide to Sydney (1149
miles) is gratifying. There are to be three divisions
-—-cars, motor-bikes, and bicvcles. The Senator has
deputed Colonel Mackay, boss of the Intelligence
Corps, to confer with the promoters, and discuss and
arange details of the contest. Writer has a pro-
found conviction that the motor-car could be utilised
enormously for defensive purooses in Australia, and
has had visions of an Australian motor-car squadron
meeting and smashing up a force of about three times
its number. Certainly, motor-cars, fitted with armor
invulnerable to rifle bullets, and carrying about 20
riflemen and a Maxim gun, would, if properly
handled, be very formidable opponents for au
ordinary force of infantry. Artillery would be the
only arm such cars would have to fear. They would
increase the value of each fighting unit enormously
in the actual scrap, and also increase the mobility
of the force out of all proportion. The Adelaidc-to-
Sydney relay ride will not throw any light on that
subject, of course, but it will do a lot to show wuat
the cars and motor-bikes can do over some pretty
bad country, and the average speed they can main-
tain under rough conditions. It would be a splendid
thing if the Senator could be prevailed upon to en-
gage a number of cars, and then let loose an ordinary
force to hunt them down. That would be a pretty
game, followed with interest by everybody, and
would throw a lot of light on the utility of the
fighting car.
The best N.S.W. performance in the Goul-
burn-to-Sydney Dunlop race was that of W. Cotterill,
who finished fourth off the 23min. mark. He will
(d.v.), officially represent the Ma State in the Warr-
nambool, on Saturday, October 14. (dome to think
of it, \Y. Rennie, the winner of the run, was very
liberally treated by the handicapper. In 1908 lie
ran second in the great Warrnambool itself, starting
from the 49min. line, and running over the 165 miles
in Bhr. 3min. 5 sec. He got in on the ground floor
of the Goulburn when he started off the 30min. mark,
lvirkham’s was a great ride, and he came near to
repeating his last year’s exploit when he ran first and
fastest in the Goulburn, in Chr. 47min.
It looks as if the back markers in the
Warrnambool are to have a good running chance
this year. The handicaps have been considerably re-
duced, and the back division is said to be stronger
than ever before. At time of writing a number of
Maoriland and other inter-State riders are already on
the ground, seeking out the bad spots thereof, and
spying out things generally.

C. R. Collier, the English motor-bikist,
made a holy smash of Jake de Rosier’s re-
cently-establis.ied records for the Flying Mile and
Lightning Kilometre. On the same track (Brook-
lands) Collier flew over the mile in 39 2-ssec., equal
to 90 miles an hour, against Jake’s 88.2, and covered
the kilometre (1093 yards) in 25sec. neat, as against
Jake’s 25 l-ssec. It’s a better game to watch than
play.
Judging by the performance at the Mount
Macedon (Vic.) hill-climbing contest on Saturday
week, this Silent Knight Slide Valve engine is a
whizzer. The Dunlop-shod Minerva car, in which it
was incorporated, sailed up the gradient of one in
seven, at a speed of 32 miles an hour. A record,
my masters, a record!
* * * *
The motor-bike recently gave a fine
demonstration of what it is capable of, when V. E.
Davis ran from San Francisco to New York (U.S.A.),
a distance of 3746 miles, in 20 days 9hr. lmin.
This knocked 11 days off the previous best. It
, would appear to have been a rough journey, with
more than a fair share of wet weather thrown in.
One day, what with heavy rain and bad roads, Davis
covered” only 49 miles, whilst his longest day’s run
was 289. ” His average journey worked out at
a trifle over 180 miles. The car record for the trip,
but by a route 200 miles shorter, is held by L. 1,.
Whitman, who puffed through in 10 days 15hr.
13min.

About the most “sporting” claim on re-
cord was made against the Adelaide Racing Club
last week. Plaintiff had eight totalisator tickets on
a winner, but the machine had somehow failed to
press the embossed number on one of them, and pay-
ment naturally was withheld. Eventually he proved
his good faith, and got his money; but meanwhile
there had been another race. He swore that he had
meant to back the winner of that also, and claimed
£l4 ss. “damages” for what he would have won.
Jim Anderson, K.C., for the Club, wondered why the
plaintiff had not “stretched his imagination a bit
more,” and the Court found “for defendant on the
law and the facts.” Even the Italian claim on
Tripoli seems good by comparison.

Mac (Q.) : Glad you forwarded tlie old
gag about boiling the billy on the grass fire. About
20 years ago it used to look us up regularly, but
since then we had lost track of it... .Learner:
Corin, Sylvia, Phyllis, Lydia, Orpheus, Swains —
whenever we strike a poem which features these
played-out folk, we ring for the office assassin. For
the rest, your work is too pretentious... .R.R.: That
joke about the actor and the No. 2 company is so
old, that sending it in is very like trying to get
j money by false pretences D.0.N.: G. Essex Evans
j wrote it: but we don’t know where a copy can be
| had .... Norseman: All right! Does anybody know
what became of Mrs. Maggot, who kept the only
hash foundry at St. Helena (Napoleon’s), and “Black
. Topsy,” who did not keep a hashery?.... Anthra-
cite: In 1910 the United States produced 27,298,545
tons of pig-iron; Germany, 14,793,325 tons; and
the United Kingdom, 10,216,745 tons. . .Sabbaticus:
All the riot of all the fanatics on earth can’t alter
the fact that the original Seventh Day was
; lost long ago, and the Seventh Day Baptist, or
I whatever he may be, might just as well keep Monday
i as Saturday. He would have just as great a chance
lof being accurate. Christmas, which is a much
newer affair than the original Seventh Day. is also
I lost- It used to be January 0. It is now December
25. The real date is supnosed, by certain authori-
ties, to be wandering around somewhere in the dense
bush of October. ... 11. M.: What is your objection to
writing the whole poem in English? Are your
thoughts so large and valuable that you have to
hire two languages to convey them in ? Or do you
just want to make an impressive rumbling on the
Inky Way?... .Lesley: A very large Saratoga trunk
argument, crammed untidily into a cheerful hatbox
poem.... The World: Not a bad point: but the
verses limp, and you haven’t enclosed the address
in space where a flying postman can find you. You
are always moving, you know J.S. (Napier,
M.L.) : Hardly enough snap. Try again, and write
in ink. Indelible pencil is hated in this office. .. .
Sweated: Sorry, but can’t reprint those verses....
L. (V.): Two negatives. .. .Tiaki (M.L.) : Re-
gret to say that we had to return a verdict for our-
selves with costs Tatt: You take your beer
too gloomily.... J.T. (Fitzroy, V.): Not very en-
tertaining. Best grovelette item the Religious
Editor remembers ran this way: “His voice smote the
stillness like ice falling on ice.” It is, of course,
unnecessary to exnlain that the voice belonged to
the Duke of Drivelditch, and that he was coldly re-
proving one of the lower classes. .. .G.E.D.: The
Squire of Wallaby Flat! Now anxiously looking
out for the Duke of Darling and the Marquis of
Murrumbidgee. Better submit your story to a
foreign paper.... Glenavon: The idea has dew upon
it, but the simple verses are hardlv B. stuff....
M. : Merely a faint echo.... Glen W.: A good try
for your years. .. .0.W.5.: As a general rule truth
seems to be duller than fiction. Refrain from send-
ing the rest. .. .Murray: None of them manage to
fly the basket. Verse is a trifle better than the
nrose, but both are a goodly distance below print
1eve1.... Starstruck : Very cloudy Yarriambiac:
No name —no address —no use —nothing! A.H.:

A BROKEN HEART.
An old man stood in a shearing shed,
The day was a regular stinger;
His hair was white, his eyes were red
For years he had been the ringer ;
The day had come he had to admit
When another had won the place;
He knew very well he would never be fit
And foolishly thought it disgrace.
“1 never thought to be beaten,” he said,
Shed a tear, and walked feebly away;
He trembled, staggered, and then fell dead
“Broke his heart,” all the shearers say.
I wonder if, at the great Judgment Day,
When millions and billions will rally,
Will the angel who meets him be able to say
“Old man, you are right in the tally?”
. ...R.N.C.: It isn’t a convincing bit of work. The
good-natured sultan who “was not filled with rage,
but closed the book at the last page” when he saw
the prize lady escaping, doesn’t seem real. We
don’t care for the maiden who “eat upon a silken
coverlet,” and who subsequently leant out the
window breathing “a song she uttered long ago to
one who wandered to and fro.” She seems suburban
somehow. And the sun came up the sky “nimbly”
—like an eager salesman who sights a customer at
the sock counter. Finally, “eve” is not much of a
rhyme for “grief.”. ..F.E.L.: “Reflections” faint...

The criminal is shadowed
By the police of the Town
Like a wild beast at large
He’s hunted down
He’s arrested on suspicion
And sent back to gaol
The stern law is deaf

He bear the broad arrow brand
Of having served time
A dark lasting blot is
The stain of Crime.

The New Encyclopaedia Britanmca
The University of Cambridge
has achieved the greatest pub-
lishing feat on record by issu-
ing the new Encyclopaedia
Britannica (11th edition) as
a whole, in 28 volumes and
index. The complete work is
now offered —for a brief time
only—to Australian purchas-
ers at the minimum price.
The entirely new 11th edition
is, by reason of improvements
in its plan and execution, the
most comprehensive, authori-
tative, and convenient ency-
clopaedia ever published in
any language. The prepara-
tion of this new edition —
which is in no sense a reprint
of its predecessors —was un-
dertaken by “The Times.’*
But it soon became apparent
that the new edition was too
important an undertaking for
any newspaper to carry to
satisfactory completion. Steps
were therefore taken to trans-
fer the copyright of the En-
cyclopaedia Britannica and
control of the new edition to
a great educational institu-
tion, and both are now vested
in the Chancellor, Masters,
and Scholars of the Univer-
sity of Cambridge, whose im-
primatur the work bears.
A New Work of Even Date —
The new (11th) edition of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica is an entirely new work —not in any
sense a mere reprint of previous editions. The
high reputation already won by the Encyclopaedia
Britannica ensured the enthusiastic co-operation
of the greatest living authorities on all subjects.
.Some of these had already contributed in their
youth to the 9th edition, and found it necessary
-only to revise and expand articles which had long
been regarded as classical contributions to learn-
ing. But these exceptions amount to less than
• one-fifth —about 17 per cent. —of the whole, and
as regards more than 80 per cent, the 11th edition
is an absolutely new work. Its method is equally
• original in respect that the whole work has been
under construction at one time, and the informa-
'tion throughout is consequently of even date 1910.
The simultaneous preparation of the 28 volumes of
text—as against the piecemeal issue of the 10th
•edition during the 27 years—has for the first time
permitted proper editorial supervision to be given to
the work as a whole. No further edition will be
published before 1925 at soonest, and the 11th
-edition will, therefore, remain the standard encyclo-
paedia for at least 14 years.
The rapid sale of the 1000 sets
now available makes immediate
application imperative to secure
prompt delivery.

if
The 2 9 volumes of the new Encyclopaedia Britannica contain over
2 million words more than did the 35 volumes of the
10th edition, yet, printed upon India Paper,
occupy one-third of the space.
A feature of the new (11th) edition is
the impression on India (or Bible)
paper. The economy of space thus
effected is shown in the illustration.
To those who are acquainted with the
previous (10th) edition, it will seem
scarcely credible that the 29 slender
volumes here shown in the foreground
are indeed the equivalent of the 35 old
volumes which stand behind them. As
a matter of fact they contain over two
million words more, without any
diminution in the size of the type. The
old volumes (which contained, on an
average, 850 pages each) measured 2%
inches in thickness, and weighed close
upon 71b. The new volumes contain at
least 960 pages each, but in the India
paper impression are one inch in thick-
ness and weigh but 31b. The old volumes
made a row of over 7ft wide, and
weighed 2401 b. The new volumes oc-
cupy 30 inches, and weigh only 841 b.
A cardinal feature of the asso-
ciation of the University y of
Cambridge with the new En-
cyclopaedia Britannica was
the decision that the work
should be sold, in the first in-
stance, at the lowest price
ever possible. Those who or-
dered the work before it was
published received an advan-
tage of 47 per cent, from the
price at which the 9th edition
was originally published, and
at which the 11th edition will
eventually be sold. Nearly
35,000 sets —over a million
volumes —were sold in ad-
vance of publication, after
which the special offer was
withdrawn, and the price was
permanently raised in Great
Britain. The publishers have
arranged that the complete
work shall now for a brief
time be offered in all parts oi
the Commonwealth on pre-
cisely the same terms as were
originally offered to subscrib-
ers in advance of publication.
But this offer must soon be
withdrawn. Immediate ap-
plication is therefore impera-
tive on all who wish to obtain
the complete new Encyclopae-
dia Britannica at the abso-
lutely minimum price.
Low Price and Easy Terms
The Press of the University of Cambridge, in ai-
ranging for the issue of the new Encyclopaedia
Britannica, has made its acquisition easy to all
classes. For the moment, it is sold at little more
than half the price originally fixed for the 9th edi-
tion. The greatest discount is naturally reserved
for those who pay cash —it is a discount of 47 per
cent, from the price which will eventually he asked
for the work. But the entire work in 28 volumes
and index will be delivered oja. payment of a single
guinea, and the payment may be completed by
monthly instalments after the work has been de-
livered. • Thus, although the applicant will re-
ceive the whole of his purchase at once, he can pay
for it in small sums at his convenience. Full de-
tails will he sent on receipt of the subjoined coupon.

There is more shotgun shooting in America than in

gun cartridges has been developed to a science. The
“New Rival” is the standard American black powder
cartridge and hence the best in the world. It can
always be depended upon to give the best results in
any gun, of whatever make. The next time you go
shooting, take some of these cartridges along and try them.
You will then realize what your gun is really capable of.

BILIOUS SUBJECTS
are generally victims of Constipation, that root evil of so many
terrible afflictions ; but they are “ bilious subjects ” no longer when
they adopt the famous Cockle’s Antibilious Pills as the standing
household remedy, now in the
Second Century of World-Wide Renown.
Cockle’s Pills, which doctors of six generations have taught the world
to use and esteem, have no harsh, coercive action on the sluggish orgasm;
they gently stimulate, soothingly strengthen and encourage, the natural
organic functions, at the same time thoroughly cleansing the system and
purifying the vital fluid. There is nothing to equal Cockle’s Pills for
this perfect cleansing, reinvigorating, purifying combination of results.
It is marvellous.

About Foreign Mummers.
| I read Maud Salome Allen’s “My
Jj “ e ant i Dahcing” in the gaol library, and hasten,
at the expiration of my sentence, to express my
thereon. Like Tommy Burns, Maud has a
literary gift, and has published her autobiography
• Pi 1 ! a rushijng--, best-selling world. It is dedicated to
Darling Mother.” (No prominent risky-turn actress
can afford to be without a darling mother.) Maud
quotes Latin, and sets out with a resolve to “liberare
anirnam mean.” She cuts the string, and her soul,
liberated, begins, with the boats from Argons “land-
ing their companies upon the Trinacrian sands ”
fussing rapidly by the “Sicily of Theocritus,” she
strmes Syracuse, in Sicily, b.c. 210, and then jumps
to London, 19.08, Quoting Carlyle, to show her
erudition, she describes in a very learned Ency-
clopsedia Britannia style, dancing from the time
2' lirgt fleet families. Proper names—
Creek, Latin, Egyptian and Jewish—stick out as they
hop along her pages—Pliny, Petronius, Appian and
btrabo, etc. Then we jump a space of time and
come to the carmagnole, and then to the Salome.
After haying chucked all this encyclopaedia stuff off
her chest, Maud begins at her beginning: “It is so
refreshing and delightful to rest a while...to close
my eyes, and just imagine that I am the little Maud
of other days, with my dollies as my constant com-
panions. She branches off into subsidiary bio-
graphies of her dolls, and '•what she said to them.
She was nearly kidnapped by an Indian squaw on her
way from Canada to San Francisco. Luckily for
the squaw, the affair miscarried. Horse and dog
stories follow the dolls. Then music—the piano!
Of course she wanted to be a great actress, like
Bernhardt (the nearest thing to Tittell Prune around
at the time). The first love affair gets a cer-
tain amount of notice. Advice from a great,
high pyramid of experience is given in a
low, sweet, patronising- voice to all below—the girls
who haven t succeeded. Then the Light (! !) broke
on her, and she_ went to Berlin. Her prediction of
her own future fame is chronicled, and her mother’s
answer: If you are the most famous woman in the
ork : 1 sM never be able to love you better, for,
Maudie, dear, aren’t you my baby?” (Tears from
the gallery.) There is some fine writing, with quota-
from Ruslan ; but just as Maud (or her literary
ghost) got to her determination “to make the human
body my instrument ” I gave up. I had had enough.
I wanted Mauds head (or her secretary’s) on a
charger or even a cab-horse would do. I think I
like Tommy Burns as an author best. He doesn’t
show so much true outwardness.”
Aibert Chevalier, now starring at the London
Coliseum, says to a Referee interviewer • “Am I
going’ to Australia*? I don’t know yet. I receive an
annua! offer to go there. Harry Rickards, who is
sitting in front to.-night, wants me down under, but
( ? ar ! t r ?f ky anything yet. If I went it would
only be with my recitals.” Chevalier lately returned
to London after- ig. long and remarkably successful
tour through thV United States and Canada He has
now tjie coster songs with Which he scored
his first big success m London halls, and goes in for
diversified .character-sketches with illustrative music.
He is a clever actor, and quite supreme in this par-
ticular line. He was once a student for the R.C.
priesthood, and has still a clerical aspect.
Gilbert, for all his cynicism and his irrever-
ence for the outward forms of aristocracy, was a solid
lory. Ills _ Good old English gentleman” sentiment
appears in his carefully-devised last will and testa-
ment, There are bequests of “ £5 for each completed
year ; of,service each to my butler, cook, housekeeper,
lady s maid, head housemaid, head gardener, head
chauffeur, am! iqny bailiff in my service at mv de-
C oo Se i lm,k ', r n< ! tice t 0 leave for misconduct;
La foiYeacn'iconrdeted year of service to each in-
door upper-servant And my second chauffeur; and £2
for each competed' year of service similarly to each
• V? ar d | fertet ! s, laborers (including cowmen and
£Jfi&t ■ Vatchmen) employed at Grim’s Dyke.”
VV.S.G. s -allotment of the legacies to his servants is
essentially undemocratic. The butlers, etc., get the
larger amounts, - because they held the best paid
.positions, and .the laborers get the lesser legacies
because they drew lesser wages. What a lordly
establishment had Gilbert! His estate was valued
at £ 112,000. He left just twice as much property
as his long-dead collaborateur, Arthur Sullivan But
on the other hand, Gilbert died only half as rich as
Richard D Oyly Carte (estate valued at £240 817)
who staged all tije Gilbert and Sullivan successes.
The author s gains are a percentage of the publisher’s
profits.

“Theorbo”: Puccini’s opera, “The Girl of the
Golden West is a London success, following that in
New York. The work is' underlined for Australia.
May it not inspire an Australian composer to do
something with our own bush life? We don’t want
Ned Kelly made into a Fra Diayolo, as appears to be
dqne in the “Golden West;” but I can see an opera I
in “Robbery Under Arms.”
At one of the Paris theatres, the long, lon<>- inter- I
vals between the acts are now lightened by "’flicker-
graph pictures of scene-shifting. A newspaper critic
remarks that a better way of showing how scenes arc
shifted would be to leave the curtain up during the
intervals. Then the audience, whilst watching the
men at work, would be able to hear their awful
language.
“C. Oekney”: George Edwardes need not go far
for his next musical-comedy plot. He has recently
been supplied with one—gratis. A few months back
one of his “extra” ladies left the theatre in a huff
and a brousrham, and married Jay Gould, jun the
millionaire son of the old money-getter of’that
ilk. The bride, it would appear, bore some
animosity against the management for not ad-
vancing her from the ranks of the common
or garden Gaiety girl, with the usual “thinking
part,” to the status of the “actress” with the one
line. The millionaire husband swore “revenge ” and
promptly proceeded to buy up all the Gaiety shares
in the market, with a view to becoming the largest
shareholder, and eventually boss of the show. The
wife began to see possibilities of a principal part in
the manufacture. But the scheme, though a good
one, did not come off. Edwardes is still at the head
of affairs, and likely to remain there, as his brother-
directors have unanimously re-elected him for a
further term of years, and Mrs. Millionaire’s chance
of becoming a Gaiety pet seems as remote as ever.

IN BANANA LAND
Kobbi” : The itinerant pedagogue of Clon-
curry, No. 2 district, has to move some for
his salary. His pupils inhabit 60.000 square
miles of country. Last year he travelled (iter
buggy 3161 miles, and visited 31 families
owning 69 children among them. Ciinna-
mulla West, down in the other corner of the
State, has an itinerant teacher’s district of
63,000 square miles, 49 families and 137
children.
The ghost of Thomas Mcllwraith is again
able to sit up and take nourishment in
Queensland. About 11 years ago, some £BOO
had been snared “for perpetuation of the
-memory of the most illustrious statesman
Australia ever possessed.” But an anti-
Boer fund of some sort came along and
caught the public eye—caught so much of it
that there was no eye left for the Mcllwraith
affair. Now the ancient and long-suspended,
spectre resumes business at the old address.
Interesting confession of a member of the
Denham Cabinet to the Brisbane Master
Builders:—
As to State brickworks, refineries, baby-farms
and State everything else, as far as I can judge,
State works mean State jobbery.
Of course, every man is entitled to speak
for himself, and call himself a rogue if
he feels that way; but when a Minister
make his condemnation so general, the public
is entitled to know which of his Tory col-
leagues he suspects.
Immediately Brisbane received the news
of the attempted train-wrecking near Charle-
ville, its Tory journals got busy with the
usual inquiries as to whether this kind of
thing was not due to Labor agitation. Next
day a lunatic confessed that he tried to stop
the train “to get a drink of water,” where-
upon the Tory Government left off libelling
its Labor foes, locked up its erring, wild-
eyed brother, and got back to business, with-
out even throwing the obvious brick at the
Cold Tea party, which has been encouraging
this dreadful mania for soft drinks.
“The Kid”: Bananaland’s Education De-
partment is supplying schools with insect
charts, and by the aid of these and regular
lessons the infant is to be enlightened as to
the various pests on the farm. Just note;
within a year—military training, drill, first
aid, cow-culture, gardening, health lessons,
Bible lessons, and a dozen other sundries as
big as a house, and now farm pests ! Each
year something is shoved into the bulging
curriculum, and nothing is cut out. Poor
Bananaland infant, and poor teacher!
Minister Grant told a teacher’s deputation,
the other day, that “if they had rain” he
would favorably consider a proposal to raise
the pedagogue’s salary all round. But who
will raise the infant’s salary? Rain may
only give him water on the brain.
A SINCERE COMPLIMENT.
JOE THE TRACKER (watching veiled bride entering church): “My word , no phirry
skeeters on that Alary!
The Public Records Office (London) re-
cently dug out an undelivered letter posted
in a.d. 1660 to somebody in the city of
Durham. The Brisbane daily press is won-
dering if it couldn’t possibly sheet home this
delinquency to the Federal Postal Depart-
ment, whose real and bogus shortcomings are
a never-ending topic in morning-journal
columns.
If Digby Denham isn’t careful, Philp will
be remembered' as a man who ruined a politi-
cal career by pinchbeck parsimony. Hitherto,
certainly, he has mostly been thought of as
an. outrageous borrower; but Denham is
going the pace so furiously that even Philp
was jerked out of his seat in the Assembly
the other day, and, before he sat down again,
he implored his butterman successor to put
on the brake and beware of extravagance.
The recent rescinding of the C.D. Act has
roused the Bananaland Leg. Council, and
that body has protested against the Govern-
ment’s action by amending the Health Bill,
so as to bring the old Act in force in Bris-
bane and its suburbs. The Council’s amend-
ment, however, will probably be rejected in
the Assembly, for a large section of the
Government party is badly Wowser-ridden,
and the Labor platform advocates “Abolition
of the C.D. Act,” apparently in the interests
of unrestrained freedom of contract—or con-
tact. In any case, why the Council re-
stricted its action to Brisbane passes all
understanding. Probably Cairns requires
protection worse than any other town in
Queensland, thanks to the Asiatic.
Our Elections.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It might have been noted by the fairly close ob-
server that the Courier of the 18th inst., which con-
tained the results of the three by-elections for Too-
wong, Rosewood and Brisbane North, published no
notices of “Births, Marriages and Deaths.” This in-
dicates a very healthy interest in politics on the
part of the population of this State. —Brisbane paper.
Oh, we dropped our careless carriage,
And we gave no more in marriage,
For we held it as a thing of little wortli ;
We surrendered fun and frivol,
And we damned in phrase uncivil,
All the jesting of the idle and their mirth.
Not a sinner could be shriven,
Not a hearse could there be driven,
For of dying at that moment there was dearth;
Not a patriotic sinner
Ever thought about his dinner;
Not a baby ever ventured on a birth.
In a quite unheard of manner,
Did we lift our party banner,
For the battle just before us bade us cease
All our joys and our vexations,
All our usual avocations,
Till the closing of the polling murmured “Peace.”
There was not a sign of suction,
There was not a single ruction,
Not a single cheer unholy rent the air;
And when M.L.A. O’Flaherty
Rendered thanks unto his party,
You’d have thought that he was sending up a
prayer.
And when dawned the merry morrow,
We renewed our joy and sorrow,
And we died or we got married as before ;
There was debt and sweat and dunning,
And the doctor’s car wa,s running,
And the straw was duly laid before the door.
QUEENSLAND.
A. JUDDITE.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, September 30, 1911.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The Vision appeared on Wednesday night
at a juvenile or immature ball, which was
set in motion by the Mayoress, aided and
abetted by Mrs. Mason-Beatty. The purpose
was one more desperate effort to give the
Children’s Hospital a leg-up. Owing to the
large collection of young mammas, old sisters
and (?) maiden aunts, who gathered to ad-
mire Gwendolin Muriel and Ivan Geoffrey
dancing in miniature coronation robes, and,
other things, copied from the Gentle-
woman’s Gush, or some such publication,
the leg-up is assured. The decorations were
scarlet poppies, and the trimmings were
faded spinster.
The Macgregor has been delivering the
firm word of encouragement to the Boys’
Home committee, whose aim it is to turn
waifs and drifts into good, healthy Aus-
tralians. The committee Jias had many set-
backs. but still cheerfully pegs away, keeping
a stiff upper lip in face of the adversity that
enveloped it when its new buildings, within
a few hours of having the last nail hammered
in, caught fire and vanished in smoke before
any insurance policy had been purchased.
Passed over into the Mysterious this week,
John Forrest, business man, cane-grower,
pastoralist and philanthropist. He was one
of the most popular figures in the commer-
cial and social life of the city, and his name
was always a starter in any subscription
stakes. As president of the golf organisa-
tion and of the Queensland Club, his hospi-
tality was as lavish as it was chronic, and
he was guilty of turning it on for more
vice-regal' importations than any other man
hereabouts. The “John Forrest” dinners
were famous. One of his last acts was to give
a commission to the Queensland sculptor,
Harold Parker; and his annual wholesale
purchase of hospital ball tickets for the
nurses earned hiin the glad eye of every
ward in the institution.
On Tuesday the Queensland Art Society
opened its doors and admitted possessors of
the nimble shilling to its twenty-third annual
exhibition. Harold Parker, backed up by
wifie, declared the show open, and a large
bunch of crimson'roses was handed to Mrs.
Parker as an endorsement of the fact.
Harold is a disappointment as a social lion,
and nary a roar could be heard from him all
the afternoon. Three plaster casts, all
sculpted since his return, were loaned to
the* * Society, and appeared in a con-
spicuous position. One was of our late
John Forrest: the other was of the artist’s
father. The clay for the latter was, till re-
cently, a portion of Queen-street. Salvana,
of your State, and Miss Grace Cameron, who
is one of us, shared the painting honors.
Mrs. James Forsyth is entertaining guests
from Westralia —for most of the time, any-
how. Other times, she is introducing, them
to our Swaggah Nobility. The favorite in-
digestion, these times, is obtained by eating
and drinking in honor of brides-elect. Latest
attack followed the announcement of the -ap-
proaching marriage of Miss Ethel Wilson, a
daughter of W. F. (Land Court) Wilson, and
a granddaughter of the late Horatio W., who
Postmaster-Generalled here for so many
years in the Continuous Ministry of more oT
less holy memory. The other contractor is
Mr. Eric Docker, of your parts. The wed-
ding bells will toll next month, and the oak
biscuit-barrel, and sterling, plated butter-
dish roll up to the fair -jig. all their grandeur.
Pretty little Dr. Hilda Greenshiels was re-
gretfully tarewelled this morning, with a
bunch of ham sandwiches and a chorus of
good wishes. The medical lady will have left
Rrisbane, for Melbourne, by the time this
pours itself into your eye.
The white-wings season was officially
floated in to-day, upon a high tide of tea
amid the presence of large herds of yachts’
and a small but select congregation of motoi-
launches. The Most Exclusive were fenced
oft within a corral, erected by the Royal
xacnt Club, and browsed upon their fodder
in the bored way of those who have sampled
all there is in life, and merely found it “aw-
fully tairesome.” Otherwise, it was a pic-
turesque display.
The Ladies’ Rowing Club is suffering from
a violent outburst of energy, and desires to
ship its feminine Bill Beaches to Melbourne
and show ‘how” in the matter of rowing.
Money-making schemes are sandwiched in
between advice, criticism and encourage-
ment at every bend of the river, and the
muscles of Wilhelmina Beach are rising like
house-rents.
Bridge parties, ’Goniindali, my dear, “ain’t
what they was,” as I heard it put in a shb-
urban salon the other day, and the game, or
robbery, is losing its popularity. All the
same, it doesn’t mend matters to hear one of
our \ ery Best acidly remark to another
when paying over losses: “Dear, dear; I’m
Paying your butcher’s bill this week!”
Douglas Mawson arrived here on Friday
and is the guest of the Queensland Club’
btrikes me Douglas will be glad to get away
to the crevasses, glaciers and avalanches as
a rest after the strenuous dash for coin in
the cities.
Commandant Parnell is up north on: a
tour of inspection. His first port of call
will be Thursday Island, where are stationed
those hilarious Tommies from Victoria, who
while passing through Brisbane, howled hor-
ribly after dark, and tore fragments off the
starry garments of the night with their yells
and other discords.
At London Shaftesbury, where Robert
Courtneidge struck a gold mine with “The
Arcadians,” he was about to produce a new
Japanese musical play when the last mail
left. It is to be called “Mi-Ai,” which, he
says, means “The Glad Eye.” .In it will-ap-
pear the Charters Towers girl, Hope Char-
ters. Courtneidge regards her as a valuable
find, and describes her as an “amazing
soprano, with a record-breaking register.”
She was studying at the Royal Academy of
Music, on the advice of Ada Crossley, when
she made the acquaintance of Courtneidge’s
daughter Cicely, who told papa all about her
wonderful voice. “Mi-Ai” is a story of love
and sacrifice in three acts —a hill-top shrine
crowded with pilgrims, the of
Sweet Content, and the o"f a temple.
Yours, affectionately, -
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Albert Norton, of the Leg. Council, who
supported a proposal introduced, the other
day, by Dr. Taylor to re-impose the pro-
visions of the C.D. Act, supported that mea-
sure when it was passed as far back as 1868,
He was then a member of the Assembly.
With ordinary luck, Queensland should
this year own as many sheep as it fed —and
then started to starve —in 1891, the year of
the great boom. The figures climbed in those
days as high as 21,708,310. Drought and
the mortgage pulled the total down as low
as 7,213,985 in 1902; but, according to the
1910 figures, published by the Government
Statist, the other day, they are up once
more to 20,331,838.
The Denham Government, which is making
large professions of its desire to amend the
liquor laws in the direction of gradual pro-
hibition, has just given proof of its sincerity
by strenuously supporting (and putting in)
Tom Welsby, the chairman of the Queens-
land Brewing Co., as M.L.A. for North Bris-
bane. It is unreliably rumored that “Bis-
hop” Barnes, the Treasurer, is to be sub-
jected to a Primitive Methodist court-martial
on a charge of general treachery.

The New P. & O. STEAMER “MEDINA," on which the King and Queen will journey to India for the Coronation Durbar.
O.T, is a Real Thirst Quencher in Hot Weather.
Although slightly hot, yet it is the most effective drink in the world
for Satisfying Thirst, for Gratifying the Palate, for Refreshing the Body.
O.T. is a specially safe drink in the Tropics, and is in great demand throughout India and other Tropical Countries. It
derives special virtues from certain ingredients which are of recognised service in stomach troubles, and which are endowed
with invaluable properties for resisting Fevers, Dysentery,: and other. Inflammatory Complaints. O.T. is the only
non-alcoholic drink that stimulates and promotes warmth in the body in cold weather.
HOW TO DRINK O.T.
Add a small quantity of 0.T., with crushed Ice if desired, to Water,
Lemonade, Ginger Ale, or Soda Water. O.T. improves the flavor and forms
a blend more grateful and more powerful in allaying thirst. A small quan-
tity, of O.T. improves the flavor of Whisky, Schnapps, Gin or Wine in a re-
markable manner, lessens their intoxicating effect, and leaves its own sweet
aroma on the breath. A wine-glass of 0.T., neat, sipped after meals, is ex-
cellent for relieving indigestion.
. DRINK O.T. AT AND AFTER MEALS.
O.T. is of special value as a meal-time drink. It greatly promotes
Digestion, and helps the stomach to perform its office. It is rich in nourish-
ment and tonic properties derived from the finest and purest natural foods
—Fruits and Herbs.
O.T. is the only non-alcoholic liqueur in the world, and therefore it is
specially suitable for Ladies. It really does what a liqueur is supposed to
do, namely, aids Digestion.

The World’s Standar
Valveless Engine.
H
Careful consideration of the prices of the FERRO
Engine will readily convince intending purchasers
that this outfit brings within their reach a plant
that has hitherto been beyond the “pocket” of many
would-be buyers. At the same time, we would like
to impress upon all that, although the Plant is low
in price, it is NOT LOW IN QUALITY. We assert,
without hesitation, that there is NOT A BETTER
ENGINE MADE than the FERRO. The low price
is accounted for by the enormous output and the per-
fect organisation of the Ferro Co., combined with
the fact that the design of FERRO omits a
number of parts necessary in ordinary Oil Engines.
In all fifteen parts per cylinder are eliminated,
and all of them parts which call for greatest ac-
curacy in design and workmanship. It is evident,
therefore, that a FERRO Engine can be made of
highest class materials at a LOWER PRICE than a
Valve Operated Engine using the same grade of
material —which few manufacturers attempt.
It must also be borne in mind that the failure of
any one of the fifteen parts mentioned will throw
the Engine out of business until it is replaced, and
the FERRO has fifteen less chances of stopping when
there is work to be done.
Don’t forget this: TIME IS MONEY.
Made in the following sizes suitable for
Stationary, Portable or Marine use :

“A BEAUTIFUL FORM AND
NO MORE HOLLOWS.”
HOW I ENLARGED MY FIGURE SIX INCHES IN 30 DAYS.
TX7 HEN my chest was flat and my
shoulders thin and hollow, I
thought that I must have been destined
by Nature to go through life without
knowing the charm of a full, beautiful
figure. I faithfully tried
every method I could
hear of, but without ob-
taining any result, and
I do not believe I would
have ever possessed my
present superb develop-
ment had I not acciden-
tally discovered a simple
process which enlarged
my figure, six inches in
30 days, and wrought a
complete transformation
in my appearance. If
every lady who longs
for a beautiful figure
could have seen me be-
fore I used this remark-
able process, and then
look upon me again to-
day, she would surely
feel that nothing leis
than a miracle could
have produced such a
marvellous J change in so short
a time. Yet this same treatment
was tried by ten other ladies
with undeveloped figures, and the
results obtained within v a few
davs utterlv astonished the medical
and scientific investigators, and in
a few weeks each of the ten
ladies had obtained a most marvellous
enlargement of the figure. Next it
was tried by fifty ladies, and the same

marvellous enlargement
was obtained. Mme. C.
Sire, of Montreuil,
Bellay, says: “The re-
sults that I have ob-
tained from the Yenus-
Carnis treatment con-
vince me that it can
ahvays be used with suc-
cess.”
This is a simple, easy
process thp,t any lady
can use at laome without
the knowledge of any-
one, and I am so grate-
ful for wha| it has done
for me that I feel 1
should reveal my secret
to all my , sisters who
need it. Simply address

Street. London. AY..

by return of post in a plain, sealed en-
velope. Ladies who fear that their
figures may become too large should
stop the treatment as soon as they have
obtained all the development desired.

Protect Your Feet by wearing Patent Asbestos Socks.
m
Before Using.
No More Pains in the Feet. The Comfort Experienced
in Wearing Asbestos Socks is Absolutely Marvellous.
Hot, Perspiring, Inflamed and Tender Feet. Corns,
Bunions and Bad Feet Prevented and Absolutely Cured
by wearing Patent Asbestos Socks, (soles). (
An Army Surgeon discovered that soldiers after marching suffered more from
of the feet than from actual physical fatigue. After long study he
|found that this was due to the irritation set up by the smooth leather insoles of
their boots. The Asbestos Socks, made from impregnated asbestos with a
slightly rough grained surface prevents the foot slipping inside, and walking is
thus less tiring. Asbestos being a non-conductor the feet are kept
from the variations caused bv hot or cold weather, a genuine joy
and blessing to the tenderfooted. In fact the comfort experienced
in wearing these socks is absolutely marvellous. Try a
pair at once. Satisfaction Guaranteed or money refunded.
They will renew the feet of anyone who has to stand long or do much
walking, such as shop assistants, policemen, nurses, sailors,
soldiers, postmen, cyclists, athletes etc. Made in two qualities, 1/- and
2/- per pair, postage 2d pair extra. Six pairs either quality sent for price of

We are in for a HOT SUMMER—this means that Ladies will find it increasingly difficult to
preserve that beautifully velvet skin which is one of their chief charms. The difficulty disap-
pears “like snow before the sun” if ladies will only prepare their skin by consistently using
ICILMA FLUOR CREAM,
the world-famed face cream without grease, which brings the beauty that lasts. A little
rubbed on the skin daily, especially before going out, prevents the ravages of the Australian
Climate, leaves no trace on the skin, and never grows hair.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will
be glad to hear of a simple and scientific de-
vice which will restore your hearing, no mat-
ter how old you are. There is no mystery
or secrecy about it; we describe it fully and
explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and
in the same way you may use this sound
magnifier as an aid to weak hearing. But,
unlike spectacles, the Wilson Common-sense
Ear-Drums are invisible and comfortable.
You can’t tell you are wearing them. No
one else can, either, because they are not
seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the
strain off them—the strain of trying to hear
dim sounds. What a blessed relief to have
done with that tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para
rubber, they cannot be felt, even when the
head rests on a pillow. For the same reason,
a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. In fact, they protect the ear, the
tender inner parts that are so sensitive, from
cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why
these facts are true, and why the Sound Mag-
nifier restores the hearing, we give an illus-
tration of one as it lies in the ear. You will
notice that the Sound Magnifier is shaped
like a trumpet, and so conveys even the
faintest sounds right to the . natural ear-
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot
hurt the ear. It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort. The division
that runs across the mouth is to allow the re-
moval and insertion of the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson Ear-Drum has
been chosen after years of experience as the
best adapted to carry the faintest sound right
down to the natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not
only trying to have people shout at them,
but it hurts the ear-drum. When age comes
the ear-drum sometimes gets thickened, or
loses its tightness, and shouting does not act
properly on it. It only makes a confused
and tiring noise. But the Sound Magnifiers
concentrate the sound in the best spot for
perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-
nerve completely, or were born deaf, we can-
not pretend to cure you. Only a miracle
could do that, in spite of some of the absurd
claims made to-day. But if you can hear the
faintest sound, do not despair. You will
never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show you from deaf people
in Australia and New Zealand who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may
wear the Ear-Drums day and night, and take
them out whenever you wish. Children can
wear them (we have special sizes for children
from six to twelve). Even a child can insert
and remove them without the least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s
single visit). This includes a pair of Drums
(they are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel
remover and also an inserter. After the first
pair is bought you may purchase a single
drum at any time for Bs., but the pair you
get at first will last quite two years. Do not
ask for a trial pair. We do not send them
out on trial, and so they are never second-
hand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent to you at once, with the
fullest instructions. Don’t delay, but have
the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

COAT COLLAR WHITE
Scalp Badly Affected* Itched Ter-
ribly. Hair Fell Out. Used Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment. Now
Has Thick Growth of Hair and Is
Never Troubled with Any Dand-
ruff or Itching of Scalp.
0.
j “I am more than gratified by the successful
results I obtained by the use of the Cuticura
Remedies. For several
years my scalp was
very badly affected
with dandruff and
scales. My scalp
itched terribly at times
and my hair fell out.
My coat collar would
be actually white with
the dandruff that had
fallen from my head.
My profession being
that of a barber, I was
particular about hav-
ing my hair in good
condition, and was also
in a position to try
many lotions, etc., for the scalp. These had
little or no effect. I had heard so much about
: the Cuticura Remedies that I resolved to try
them, I shampooed my head with Cuticura
Soap twice a week and after drying my head
thoroughly, I anointed parts of my scalp
with Cuticura Ointment. I was pleased from
the outset, and continued to keep up this
treatment. To think that only three cakes
■of Cuticura Soap and one and one-half boxes
■of Cuticura Ointment rid my head of this
trouble, made me feel quite con-
tented. 1 have now got a thick growth of
iihair and 1 am never troubled with any
■'dandruff or itching of the scalp. There is no
’ •'question but that the Cuticura Remedies
"cured me. I frequently recommend them to
trny customers, and they think a great deal of
Them, so you see I am very willing to help a
.'good cause along." (Signed) John F. Wil-
Ijiams, 307 Norfolk Street, Dorchester,
Boston, C. S. A.. July 28, 1910.

t 9'k- : file export of Australian butter to
London has increased from 17,600 tons in 1000 to
44,400 tons this year, but even now this Country
ships only half as much churned eow-juiee as little
Denmark. And, by the way, it is pretty certain that
Danish butter is sold much cheaper in Copenhagen
than Australian butter in Sydney or Melbourne-. The
Government which fostered the export trade for the
producers has also protected Danish loeal Consumers
against the rapacious middlemen-. But irt -Australia
the city cost of butter and butchers’ meat has in-
creased enormously, whilst the producers on the
land have been enormously increasing their Output
export. This sinful anomaly is surely not incur-
able except in the Intilil'di l ef the Tbr-y press;
Workers, whose pockets Suiter most by it-, art told
by the Daily Liar that the rise in the host of food
is a natural result 'of an iniprov'ftvie'rVt in wages. The
fact that the Tory -argument tfriesn’t apply to fruit
(which has become cheaper and better, whilst the
export of it Was increasing) is not generally re-
marked,- If Hood’s “Song of the Shirt” were re-
written to suit the modern factor}' girl, she would
moan: “O, God! that meat should be so dear, and
peaches and pears so cheap ! ” God knows ; also, the
trade conspirators know, and it is time Labor poli-
ticians started to study the question, and turn their
knowledge to practical account. Wanted some new
Protection for the worker against the food dealers
who rob him of another shilling a week for every
eighteenpenny rise in wages that he achieves, anil
tell him that the extra cost of living is due solely
to the inexorable law of national prosperity, or what

''Bromide"; Glad to see that the Geeleng Chamber
of Commerce has been kicking up a shine about the
“bleeding" of Wheat bdgs> Lfe-., slitting them, open
and letting sufficient wheat tuft hut th enable the
bags te> be stewed in small spaees-. But it isti’t all
the fault Of Cargo WOrkets-. The shipping Chsi Wdttt

The stevedoring bos-, feet the Shme Way. about its be-
cause the more they erowd into a ship the bigger
their profits-. 1 kpbW they’re paid by Weights but if
you can rata the weight into (say) one vessel, it
saves time afi'd money that would otherwise have to
be spent in rigging gear on a second vessel. So the
stevedore’s gangs have to stow in accordance With
orders, and when the owners or skipper shy that a
2in. vacancy is really a 2ft. void, Arid that, “Y’ Can

out with your knife arid “bleed” .ufttil the super-
fluous wheat has frill Out. HaVe just finished loading
a wheat steamers arid fcf days we were bullocking
hard, filling rip OVery inch of space in the lower
holds-. We had to “bleed” very freely in places to
do it, and when she was down to Plimsoll there
were tons of empty space on the ’tween decks. A
little less crowding” beiow would have made it much
easier for the men; a little less space would have
been empty on the ’tween decks, and the sea-going
qualities of the vessel would not have been interfered
with. All this apart from the loss to the wheat-
owners. Now that I’ve put the Geelong Chamber
of Commerce wise to the facts, I expect it to fasten
to the greedy companies that are not content with
fair profits. Also, I expect it won’t do so.

A remarkable discovery has been made on the
west coast of the South Island of M.L., in the shape
of the mother reef from which all greenstone is sup-
posed to be derived. It was found high up in the
mountains of the Arahura district, in a vast outcrop
containing millions of tons. Experts state that it is
the first deposit of jade found for 2000 years, and
one measurement of 370,000 tons of greenstone has
been valued at between 2s. and 6s. per lb. on the
field. The usual shindycate has got into action.
These announcements may seem a trifle feverish, but
all new finds have a tendency to start at a high
temperature.

Richmond Council (Victoria) has got going a
scheme of sickness and accident insurance for its
employees that some old and brawny conservative will
doubtless, some day, claim as his own patent.
The beauty of it is that there are only two items
in the balance-sheet-receipts and sick pay ; no office
rent, canvassers’ wages, commissions, advertising ex-
penses, or directors’ fees. All employees belong to
it, and pay 6d. per week (boys 3d.) to the council
paymaster, who keeps the books and makes the pay-
ments — £1 a Week for s-x months, afterwards
graduating as with a friendly society. There are,
of course, no medical benefits or funeral expenses
provided, the main idea being to supplement the
ordinary “lodge” benefits. The wonder is that the
Municipal Association hasn’t taken up this and fire
insurance long ago. The profits from the latter
should give it respite from its present main business
—that of cadging road and bridge grants from the
Government.
“Pick-axe”: Percy was a nice boy with lovely
turned-up trousereens when he was pitchforked into
the country branch of the bank; but that didn’t
save him more* than one day. “Know how to post
ledgers?” says the manager. “Ya-as,” says Perce.
“All right,” says his j ills; “you can start right
away. Mr. Smith will show you round.” But
Mr. Smith was out and Perce got busy without him.
Half an hour later he knocked at the manager’s
door, puffing hard, and as red as a punch on the
nose. “Well?” snapped the boss, who had been
reducing the world’s supply, of whisky overnight.
“I’ve tried nearly all the-ledgers, sir, but they won’t
go into the post-office bQK! ”} That’s the last I saw
of Percy,
THE DOINGS OF JERRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
N.S.W-.
I reside in a house
That is one of a lot;
That in winter is cold
And in summer is hot;
It is filled up with rooms
Where there's no room at all ;
Has a grave plot in front
And a thirty-inch hall.
But it’s done up in style,
All stained-glass and gilt,
Is this wonderful house
That by Jerry Was built.
All the Walls ate fis thin
As a drunkard’s excuse;
You can glean all the best
Of the neighbors’ abuse.
You must hear Miss Nextdoor
As she whispers her prayers;
And her father s remarks
As he tumbles upstairs;
And three houses away,
When its noises are spilt,
The piano which also
By Jerry was built.
It has windows and doors
Which are all out of plumb,
And which rattle and creak
When the westerlies come;
It is finished throughout
In a jerry-built way;
And jerry-built meals
Deck the table each day.
Yes, the street where I live
Is chock-full of these hives,
Where the people are living
Their jerry-built lives.
Oh, great Jerry is king
Of suburbanite lives;
There are jerry-built husbands,
And jerry-built wives;
And jerry-built marriage
With jerry-built rings,
For the wonderful Jerry
Supplies both these things.
And what I am after
And eager for (very),
Is hemp and a hangman
For the great builder Jerry.

WHY YOU CAN THUST MY
FREE CIGAR
TRIAL
<Z4A/Y\>
ALMOST everybody knows about my efforts
to make Cigar-smoking popular in Aus-
tralia.
• My FREE CIGAR TRIAL is this:—l’ll send
you a box of ioo DIADEMAS for 22/6—equal, as
they are, to any 6d. Cigar on the market; really
worth £2 ss, per 100 —and you can smoke 5 or 6
of them. If they aren’t as good as any Cigar
you have ever tried, send the remainder back to
me, and I'll refund your money in full, without
any charge for those you’ve smoked.
g-f
Now, I want to prove to
you how straight this'offer is.
You might think—“ Why
doesn't he send the box up
without any money, and let
us send the money on when
we’ve tried the 5 or 6 and
found them as good as he
says, or else return the
balance then?”
I tell you right oft, I’d like
to do that, But that would
put all the trusting tan my
side—and I’ve got to make a
living.
I know nearly every man-
jack ofyou wouldact straight
to me if I did make this ofier.
But you know as well as I
there are some who would
get the Cigars, and let me
whistle for the money.
I know there’d be only a
few who would do this; but
I sell my Cigars .so close to
cost—cutting off all the ware-
houseman's, traveller’s and
retailer's profits—that these
few would cripple my scheme
altogether. That's why I
can’t do it and give the same
Cigar value as I give to-day.
I know you're trusting me
in sending down the money
before you get the Cigars.
But you’ll get the Cigars
right by return post, never
fear, You can smoke sor 6
of them, and if they're not
as good as you expected,
you can send what are left
right back. I’ll return your money —every
penny of it, with no deduction whatever—
and even here you needn’t only take my word
for it.
I have my banking account at the Com-
mercial Bank of Australia Limited, Melbourne.
The General Manager there knows all about
me and my way of doing business. He'll vouch
for me; and you can refer to him before you
send any order at all to me. That’s proof of my
squareness, isn’t it?
Sit down now and send me 22/6 to-day, and
I'll forward you a box of 100 DIADEMAS—
Cigars that I promise are equal to any 6d.
Cigar sold in Australia—made from clean, long,
straight Brazilian leaf, and rolled in the finest
Java wrapper.

LOOK OUT for
SPRINC DANCERS
NOW is the time to be on the “look-out” for the dangers of Spring—
dangers from within as well as from without. A besieged fortress
after a long siege is not only more watchful of danger from attack
by an enemy without, but also of danger from weakness within. The
human system, after the long siege of Autumn and Winter, is weakened
through over-work—over-work of all the digestive organs which have had
to cope with the extra food consumed (a necessity during the cold months),
and over-work caused by resisting the attacks of colds and chills. The
weakened system is less able to withstand the renewed attacks of the
changes of temperature, and must be toned up. There is no tonic like
Bile Beans, because they are purely vegetable, and assist the over-
worked organs to cope with the demands of Nature and gradually
restore them to their normal condition, so that they are again able-
unaided—to perform their natural functions. With the system so
toned-up you can withstand the many dangers that lurk in the Spring-time.
Mrs. E. E. Johns, of Victoria Street,
Lewisham, Sydney, says: —“Bile Beans are
an ideal Spring medicine, and a box of them
should be in every home. I have used Bile
Beans for myself and family for years, and
can highly recommend them. A friend of
mine, residing in Victoria, first sent me a box
of the Beans some years ago, and now I
would not be without them in the house. I
have a large family, and at Spring-time and
other changes of season, give them Bile
Beans, which ensure their good health.”
THE STANDARD FAMILY MEDICINE.
Bile Beans are a proved remedy for biliousness, headache, Indigestion, stomach troubles,
constipation, piles, debility, female ailments, nervousness, bad blood, bad breath, anaemia, dis-
turbed sleep, loss of appetite, Spring ailments, and, in fact, all ailments that owe their origin
to defective liver action. Obtainable everywhere at Is. I£d., or 2s. Od. large box (containing three
times the Is. IJd. size); or post free from The Bile Bean Mfg. Company, 39 Pitt Street, Sydney.

The Reformation of the Eldest
Son.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[When I wrote those pieces, “The Elder
Son” and “The Good Samaritan”—which
last I consider one of the purest and most
religious things 1 ever wrote —some alleged
critics, and, notably, an individual in Mel-
bourne, whom I understand to be a
poet, and who signs himself Gyles
Turner, accused me of Blasphemy and
other things. When I publish my forth-
coming banad, “ Joseph Dreams,” he may
have something more to say on the subject.
Now, I never said or wrote a blasphemous
thing in my life, nor thought one as far as
Christ and Christianity are concerned —
heathen though I may be, and as my old
Norse fathers were (I feel very Norse of
late years). I consider the Christian Bible
to be one of the truest books ever written —a
book of life and human nature described by
men who knew it. I consider the tales of
Joseph, the Prodigal Son, and others (ex-
cepting that grand story, the Good Samari-
tan) to be vivid sketches of real life —real-
ism such as a Zola might have written —
human nature with all its weaknesses, and
not to be taken as object lessons at all.
All things considered, Gyles Turner and
his brethren might well have studied the
Good Samaritan, and learnt a little from
him.]
f I HE Eldest Son was a young man still,
Though toil and worry had told on
him;
The land and the people were hard to till,
His back was bowed and his eyes were
dim
(Dimmed by the long, long years of
drought).
And his heart was tired of beating alone.
The home was barren within and without, '
The ground was hard and the hearts were
stone.
The Youngest Son went to the world away
With a tenner a horse and a good rig-
out,
And his horse was stuffed with the last of
the hay,
And he left the farm in a blazing drought.
But the Eldest fought till the fight was won,
With despair in his heart and dust in his
throat;
’Twas never he heard from the Youngest
Son,
Unless he wanted a five-pound note.
The second son and the third were “good,”
Though born in a measure resentful, too.
But the second was married (to Sarah
Wood),
And the third was lame —so what could
they do?
There were bickerings, growls and venom,
you bet —
You know how the big bush families
run—
(The Eldest inherits the Nothing-to-Get),
But one sister stuck to the Eldest Son.
The long drought broke; good seasons came ;
And after harvest the cheques flowed in.
But the money was banked in the Old Man’s
name,
While the Son toiled on —’twas a thank-
less sin.
The seasons held and the folk grew rich,
There were regular crops—there was regu-
lar rain,
Till one grand season, no matter which,
The Prodigal Son strolled home again.
Let the parable here take up the theme.
Bring it up to date and it fills the bill.
The Eldest woke from a lifelong dream,
Or a lifelong stupor—-which—as you will.
He was quite fed up, for the scales were
gone
From his blighted eyes (and he saw, of
course).
He left the selection one day at dawn,
But he took no tenner and took no horse.
The Eldest travelled the great wide world —
The world where his spirit by right be-
longed—
That was manned and womaned and boyed
and girled,
And wronged and righted, and righted and
wronged.
He worked for wages—he worked for a
boss —
He drifted by many a town and run,
Till a woman there was (as there always
was)
Who saw a man in the Eldest Son.
The woman took him and dressed him right,
And made him shave, as a woman can ;
And his eyes grew bright in a single night,
And the Eldest Son was a handsome man.
(He seemed a stranger without his beard).
But women were quick since the race
began;
She talked to him till the cobwebs cleared,
And the Eldest Son was a thinking man.
The woman took him and taught him guile
(She taught him guile, as a woman can),
And “manners” to hide it —after a while —
And the Eldest Son was a clever man.
And the woman took him and stroked his
fur,
As women have done since the world
began.
Till he looked from superior heights on her,
And the Eldest Son was a confident man.
The woman took him and taught him love —
The love for a woman, as women can,
From the realms below and the realms above,
And the Eldest Son was a watchful man.
And the woman' took him and taught him
hate;
She showed how he’d wasted his life’s
short span,
And she told him to wait till a day too late J —
And the Eldest Son was a vengeful man.
She sent him away to a seaport town
( A woman of old and wise was she),
And a cheque from an aunt (resurrected)
came down,
And he travelled by land and city and sea.
He wore no rags, and he felt no cold,
F* e c turned to neither the right nor left,
ailed like the Prodigal Son of old —
iic ate no husks from the hogs bereft.
He found some swine where the wild cats
stink,
And the toiler is done on a toasting fork ;
But the wise men found, when they came to
thick,
That he’d ground the grain, and he'd cured
the pork.
And mail by mail as the swift years passed,
The woman she wrote as a woman can,
And when he came back to her side at last,
The Eldest Son was a wealthy man.
The woman took him and bore him sons,
To fill to the brimming his joyful cup.
Fie purchased the pick of the southern runs,
For them to people when they grew up.
But he went to the old selection first,
And, oh! they were glad to see him come;
For he found things there at their very worst,
So he brought his Prodigal Father home.
He found that nothing to save the wreck
Had ever been done by the Prodigal Son,
So he took him sternly by the neck,
And set him to work on his richest run.
And he left him there with every chance
To rise in time to be overseer,
And the Eldest Son —this is no romance —
You’ll see him down at the Cup next year.

HENRY LAWSON.
The Astroger: a Freak of
Wanton Wealth.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SQUATTER HOWARD ate his break-
fast in silence; and so did I. He was
trying to think, and 1 was too hun-
gry to talk. But having gracefully topped
off with some choice fruit, he pushed his
plate away, and remarked that he was
tired of the monotony of eating and living
in general.
‘“You used to have an imagination, but
since you’ve made your pile, it seems to have
disappeared,” he remarked savagely.
“It has served its purpose!” 1 replied.
“Not at all,” he snorted. “Any fool can
make money, but only men of taste and
imagination can enjoy it. It is when a man
has made his pile that he requires imagina-
tion. For the love of heaven, get it back, or
grow a new one. See if you can’t invent a
new sin. I’m dead tired of everything.”
Then he picked up the paper and waded
into the news, keeping up a running fire of
comment as he straggled down the columns.
“I see they’ve jugged a bloke for calling
himself an astrologer, and casting horoscopes
for half a dollar each. Why the devil
shouldn’t I be able to get my horoscope cast
if I’m fool enough to want it?”
“Well,” 1 retorted, “when you get to that
stage, I shall suggest that the Master in
Lunacy take over your estate —otherwise
you might have to work for your living.
Once a man or woman starts going to astrol-
ogers, card-readers, crystal-gazers and those
sort of people, he’s a gone coon. They spend
all they have on the harpies, and a wise,
paternal Government has decreed that these
dupes shall be protected from themselves.”
“H’m ; yes—perhaps so. But do you know
why the poor go to the astrologer and such-
like? Of course, you think it is foolishness.
It isn’t. The wizard and the sibyl give them
hope. They bring an atmosphere of romance
into a dull grey life. This enactment is
going to take the rare gleams of sunshine
out of many and many a dull, drab life.
Gosh! I’ve got an inspiration! We’ll turn
astrologers !”
“And get run in !”
“Run in be d-—d! We’re millionaires ;
and surely you know by this time the law
never jugs a millionaire. Even if he com-
mits murder, it is put down to insanity; and
the worst that can happen him is a private
suite in a madhouse.”
“We’d certainly get some rare glimpses of
life,” I meditated.
“And do a little good bringing back lost
sunshine to people who need it badly. Let’s
get this bloke’s address.”
* * * *
We did the thing properly. As fortune-
telling, astrology and so forth were illegal,
Howard put on his shingle, which replaced
that of the jugged astrologer, these words:—
SPENCER HOWARD,
Consulting Hours: Adviser.
11 till 12.30.
2.30 till 4.
8 till 10 Wednesdays and Saturdays.
We had knocked two large rooms into one
to make the temple; and a weird sanctuary
it was. Money was no object. The walls
were painted deep crimson and hung with
pictures of saints and devils —especially
devils. One masterpiece represented the
ejection of Satan and his angels from
Heaven. A fearsome daub it was, but it pos-
sessed considerable strength, of a kind. A
dado of beaten copper gave an atmosphere of
gorgeous luxury. Silver statues held elec-
tric globes surrounded by ruby shades; and
at the far end, where there used to be a win-
dow, rose the gilded pipes of a small organ.
In front of it was a brass altar, with demon
heads at the corners, on which burned per-
petually (in business hours) a small fire of
sandalwood sticks.
This I attended to, arrayed in a close-
fitting costume of golden-tinted material
over which fell in loose folds a jet black
cloak lined with the same deep fint that
gleamed from walls and electric globes.
As for Howard, he was just it. He was
a gigantic man, and his 6ft. 3in. of hard
bone and meat was sheathed in a costume
of shiny black silk. From his shoulders
hung a heavy crimson cloak. On his huge
head he wore a sort of helmet surmounted
by a crown built to order (it nearly caused
the jeweller who got the job to take a fit).
Last, and most important of all, a gilded
respirator made him like neither beast nor
human, but just plain jim-jam.
He entered the room through a heavily
curtained door just behind his throne. I
came in through a panel in the organ. He
seated himself on his eminence, and I stood
beside my altar and lit the sticks of sandal
wood. He surveyed me interestedly for a
few moments, and then burst into a wild
guffaw :—-
“A pretty-looking blanky object you are !”
he howled.
As I knew he would make this inane re-
mark I had brought a mirror with me, and
I walked up to him and held it so that he
could see himself in all his hideousness.
“Fetch the camera!” lie murmured.
"Gosh, I’m just dying to see the effect this
will produce on the first copper who comes
sniffing round to get a case. Ho. ho !”
We had secured the father-in-law of the
jugged astrologer for a door varlet, and had
clad him in a rich black costume that con-


BACKACHE A SIGNAL OF DISTRESS.
A Warning: That Must Not Be Ignored.
Pain in the back is the kidneys’ signal of distress. If this
timely warning is ignored, kidney disease silently fastens its
deadly grip—for kidney sickness first shows itself in pains and
disorders in other parts, and the real cause is too often hidden
until fatal Bright’s disease or diabetes has set in. Suspect the
kidneys if you are rheumatic and nervous or have lame back,
painful, too frequent or scanty urination, weak heart, dizzy spells,
headaches, bloating or neuralgia. What you want is a special
kidney medicine —not an experiment, but one that has stood the
test for years. DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS
relieve weak, congested kidneys—cure backache —regulate the
urine. They are used and praised all over the civilised world.
Sydney Proof.
Mr. W. B. Lewis, 10 Laura Street, Xewtown, Sydney, states: “There is no medicine more
satisfactory or really beneficial that I know of than Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Much sickness
and broken time would be avoided, especially by those who, like myself, are occupied at outdoor
work, if these pills were better known. One of the many advantages about Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills is that they may be taken with perfect safety at any time. I suffered from the kidneys for
some time, and was recommended to try them, and they gave me great relief. My friends, to whom
T have spoken of their excellent effect, speak in similar terms of them. I have no hesitation in
saying that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are the most comforting and most certain to give relief
of anv kidney medicine I have ever tried.”
Seven years later Mrs. Lewis says: “My husband has not suffered with his kidneys since Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cured him seven years ago.”

trusted elegantly with his head of silver
hair. He was well known, and would give
a feeling of security to the clients. He en-
tered to announce that two people were wait-
ing counting the minutes till 11 o’clock.
“To your altar, high priest and chief
bottle-washer !” Howard said in a tone of
dignity, gathering his lurid cloak around,
liiin like a Roman toga.
A man and woman were ushered in. They
looked round the room, gaped, paused, and
then recovering themselves, walked steadily
to the chairs the silver-headed usher had
placed for them. One glance at the gentle-
man’s feet revealed the fact that he wore
the regulation bobby s boots. He wanted
his hand read, or his horoscope cast, or
something—anything to convince his wife
that he had not been carrying on. He
rather thought the stars might disprove her
charges. And, drawing back for a moment,
he gave the apparition on the throne a most
corrupt wink.
I added fuel to the altar fire, and the
burst of sandal wood perfume caused him to
cough. Yiie vast form on the throne leaned
forward, and pointing a long and curiously-
carved wand at them, said in a sepulchral
tone: —
“My son, the stars never lie! Thou hadst
better consult a private detective!”
“Well, if your science can tell my wife
anything wrong about me by all means tell
it. I’n pay for it, whether it’s good or
bad.”
“My son, jest not in the temple. The
woman beside thee is no wife of thine. Every
cook along thy beat hath a better title to
that Sacred designation. At least, they
feed thee. This female but shares in thy
reward, and drinks thy beer. Go : the wis-
dom of the seers, like, the titbits of the kitchen
and the beer of the midnight pub, is free to
the police. Corrupt bobby, avaunt!”
I threw a handful of mixed incense and
sulphur on to the altar and dived into the
organ. Through the glass panel I saw the
couple rush for the door. The seer rose in
haste, and started to sneeze violently.
A minute later lie was in the organ with
the whisky bottle!
“Gosh, old man, don’t put so much sul-
phur with that incense—l nearly blew up
before I could get out.”
Opening the ventilators, we set all the
fans going, and in a few minutes had the
atmosphere clear. Howard once more as-
sumed his respirator, and deposited himself
on his throne. I touched a button and a
tiny peal of bells gave the signal to admit
the next.
She was a demure and obviously worried
little woman of about 30. She nearly fell
down dead when she entered that awful
room. A rolling cloud of incense drifted
down on her. From the organ came a tiny
peal of bells, and a vox humana rose and fell
in a musical whisper. The silver-haired
usher placed her in the chair, bowed three
times to the apparition on the throne, and
retired backwards.
“Yes!” inquired Howard in a voice that
came from the bottom of his boots.
Three times the little woman tried to
speak, and failed miserably. I approached
her with a glass of port. She gulped it
down eagerly, and then looked at me appeal-
ingly.
“Fear not, but lay bare thy heart without
reserve, my sister !”• I said as sweetly as my
mask would let me.
“it's about me husband,” she started witli
a sudden jerk, “lie’s got another. What
must I do to win him back? Can you tell
me if I will get him away from her? Can
you make him leave hen?”
The draped and crowned monster on the
throne sat silent. I knew what was passing
in his mind. Suddenly he shook himself,
“Hast seen this other?”
“Oh, yes, I saw her ,at the moving pic-
tures with him,” she replied brightly, for-
getting her nervousness m the' intensity of
her jealousy. “She's common-lookin'. Wears
fine feathers, like all her sort. Of course,
she isn’t really in love with him, an' only
does it to take him away from me, an to get
what she can out of him.”
As she spoke, across her face swept a look
of fearful hatred.
‘ if I give thee unlimited power over
this woman, what will thou do unto her?”
“I’d like to burn her alive, but I s’pose
I’ll have to be content with seeing her com-
pelled to go to work again.”
“Methinks thou liatest the woman more
than thou lovest tliy husband, woman !” said
the grim object above, struggling hard to
preserve the dignified style of utterance
which lie thought fitted his character.

llim the atmosphere of romance. She comes
into llis life like the breeze of the ocean, and
gives him thoughts, ideas and expressions—
all y ery useful in writing memorial verses
and other advertisements, and in reporting
tbe case o£ tke man who was run over by a
mea t van in the suburbs. She nourishes his
heart, stimulates his imagination, gives him
the , -i oy lif ®- Naturally the man cleaves
to ber - Woulqst have thy husband back?”
“What do you think I came here for?”
“God knows! Well, get thee home. Put
buttons on his shirts and sponge his faded
black suit with cold tea. Deck thy hair with
flowers and ribbons. Make love to him. Be
coquettish. Be skittish if thou canst skit,
Laugh at his jokes. Admire his verses, and
ask him to read them again to thee. Learn
them bv rote, and bring him more inspira-
tion than this other one, and, if he is a fool,
he will forsake her for thee. Begone! This
effort to keep to the second person singular
groweth wearisome. Behold my jaw aclieth. ’
“Can't you read the future, and tell me
how it’ll pan out?”
“The gods help them who help them-
selves. They have given thee the inside
blanky running, though why is beyond human
comprehension. There is no future to read
for thee—the gods are not interested. They
have given thee the dashed inside running—
it is enough.”
He waved his sceptre towards the door.
“But”
On went the sulphur, as the gigantic
figure reached the curtained doorway. She
caught a full breath, coughed, sneezed and
scrambled out.
I was already out.
The fame of our temple spread fast, and
the street outside was blocked. People
who came in private carriages and motor-
cars had to sign cheques for hospitals before
they could secure tickets. Those who trooped
along on foot in shabby clothes with worried
expressions got a preference, came in freely,
and usually went comforted away.
Then there were other callers. Detec-
tives broke in with search warrants. Badly
disguised policemen were foiled by our re-
fusal to take money. Journalists came with
cameras hidden in paper parcels. Artists
tried to make surreptitious rough sketches.
It was an interesting time.
Then society girls, sniffing at romances,
floated in and were told strange truths
about themselves. But it was as an adviser
to women who wanted to regain the affec-
tions of their husbands that Howard showed
his genius. He sent them away loaded up
with worldly wisdom, and impressed with
the fact that they only lost their husbands
because they deserved to do so. They went
home and spent the vegetable money on hair
ribbons, roses for their ear-locks, and such-
like vain things.
Howard was never weary of congratu-
lating himself that we were doing good
work.
“I believe we’ve reunited more couples
than the parsons have married fresh ones,”
he chuckled with the same feeling that
another man feels when he sends an anony-
mous donation to a hospital.”
He slunk in nervously, carrying a faded
hard hat in one hand and a portfolio, some-
what the worse for wear, in the other. He
slipped anxiously into the big chair, and
seemed prepared to bolt at any moment.
He eyed the room with wonder, and then
gazed in a horrified way at Howard’s weird
form, gripping the sides of the chair convul-
sively as he glared.
When the organ music breathed through
the room he turned to stare, and half-rose as
a thick cloud of scented smoke drifted down
on him. But Howard cut short the agony :
“Speak, O man!” was the tenor of his
observation.
But the alleged man remained inert, a
shrivelled heap in the chair. I offered
whisky. He gulped it down too quickly and
choked. The second dive at the glass
brought better luck.
‘‘Tell him what you want to know!” I
whispered : “he is the soul of kindness.”
He muttered some thanks, and once more
fixed his blinking eyes on the tower of brawn
on the throne.
"Its this way,” he commenced. ‘‘A few
weeks ago my wife went .to someone —well,
it was you. She told about the other girl
I d got. The feller told her to doll herself
up before I came home, to listen to me
poetry, and ask me to say it again. I was in
love with my girl, but, somehow, I said to
meself, if the wife's always going to be like
this 1 don't want any girl. I write adver-
tisements in verse, memorial cards, all sorts
of things. Sometimes I write political skits.
My girl put me up to it. She used to polish
them up, too. 1 got on. I was the best on
the market, and had more work than I
could get through. I was doing well. My
wife found out about the girl; but I stood
the racket. She couldn't be worse than she
was before, and I felt it was the price I had
to pay for the girl’s assistance. It was
worth it. She stimulated me. We had good
times. We went everywhere. And then
one night I came home, and found my wife
dolled up with flowers in her hair and a
smile on her face and her lips painted. She
held out her arms to me :
“ ‘What has my beloved been writing to-
day'.’'’ she inquired.
“ ‘Come off,’ I said, for I knew it was a
put up thing. ‘What’s your game, anyhow:’
“ ‘Oh, Alfred,’ she said, ‘l’m a new
woman. I’m going to make myself attract-
ive to you, and try to be a joy to you. I’ll
never nag at you any more. You’ll find me
a changed woman from this out. You can
kiss me if you like.’
“And I believed it,” he groaned. “I saw
the girl, and explained to her that it wasn't
right of me to let her waste her life on me.
She said she'd sooner waste it on me than
anyone elsy. But I argued with her, and
brought her round to see the wrong of u
all. And in the end she went to service—
housekeeping for a widow man —and last
week she married him. As soon as my wife
heard of it, and that was the day it hap-
pened, she dropped wearing the roses. She
gave me a piece of her mind, and told me
how she had fooled me. She never wants to
hear my verses. She never puts flowers in her
hair. Sometimes —very often, in fact —-she
goes out and leaves me to cook my own tea.
Now I want advice. I’ve been a fool. I’ve
thrown away the girl that was my inspira-
tion. I can’t write verses, or advts., or any-
thing else. I’m on the down-grade. Last
night I found it was you who told her how
to fool me. Now I want you to square the
account. How can I fool her?”
The giant on the throne said never a word.
He was a graven image.
“I’m a ruined man. I must have congenial
companionship. Without it I can’t work.
What can I do? Tell me what I am to do.”
But the draped idol on the throne said
never a word. The broken man beat the at-
mosphere with his hands. He grew sarcastic.
“You could tell her, but you haven’t a
word for me!” he said reproachfully. Then
he fell back in the chair as Howard heaved
himself up, and flung his helmet, crowm and
respirator from him.
“Stop that stink,” he shouted to me as I
threw some more incense on to the altar.
“And fetch my cheque book.”
The faded little object in the chair
looked at the cheque closely. It was
for £5OO, and he went away comforted.
But Howard went out and took to drink. At
time of writing he is still out.
