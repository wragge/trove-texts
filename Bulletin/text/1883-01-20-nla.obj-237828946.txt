Those Horrid—Scotchmen.
The organa of capital and “ respectability ” will
soon have to leave off referring to “ no-rent ’’ agi-
tation and the expedient of “ Boycotting ” as
peculiarly Irish, and therefore horrid, and as dis-
tinctly Eoman Catholic, and therefore irreligious.
As particulars of the agrarian movement in the
Highlands and Islands of Scotland come to hand,
the evidence that identical causes will create
identical agitations, without reference to the
nationality or religion of a spirited people, becomes
overwhelming. It is pretty well known that the
old feudal affections between laird and tenant,
chief and clansman, have generally died out in
Scotland. The old landed families have, in a great
number of cases, disappeared, and been replaced
by tradesmen — London burghers, “ Glasgie
bodies,” and so forth. Even whore the old
families are still in possession, they have generally
been infected with the spirit of the day. The
laird passes his time at London, or in Continental
travel, and the old-time relation between him and
his people is dead and gone. The tenant is but a
machine for producing rent—that is to say, income
for the laird to spend in a London season or a
Mediterranean yachting cruise. The more income
the better ; and if grouse or deer prove more
profitable tenants than human beings, the latter
must be screwed up to the grouse rate of profit or
go. 1 his has been going on in the Highlands and
Islands for a long time low, and at last is bear-
ing its natural fruit.. The crofters in the Islo of
Skve have been holding out against the landlords,
and refusing to pay rent until certain grievances
have been redressed. This would be perfectly
constitutional and right in the subjects of a
monarch. It is one of the principal boasts of the
British Constitution that the subject class should
be entitled to demand ‘‘redress of grievances
before granting supply.” But by some odd pro-
cess of unreason, the same thing is grossly wrong
and violent when the subject is a tenant and the
monarch a landlord.
• • •
There is no doubt at all in our minds that the
tenant, alike in Ireland and m Scotland is dis-
tinctly in the right. Every man has a right to live,
and if by his exeitions the soil can be made to
yield only enough for the subsistence of himse ,
his labourers, and his family, then he is entitled
to the whole of it, and no other person can
properly claim any part — whether he be
termed landlord, chief, or sovereign. Not
only has every man a right to live, but
he has a right to live where bis fathers
have lived before him, provided his indus-
try. when applied to the soil, produces suffi-
cient tor his needs. As matters are at present,
and have been for some time, managed, the doc-
trine of landlordism seems to have been that
Irishmen have no light to live in comfort save in
the United States or the colonies, and that High-
landers and Islanders must seek Canada or Aus-
tralia if they desire to be regarded as worthy ot
more consideration than deer or grouse. 1 he tact
is that landlords in the old country have aban-
doned their legitimate position.. Richard
Cobden saw this long ago. Respecting Ireland
and his reasoning applies with equal force to the
north and north-west of Scotland he wrote in
1848 to George Combe :—“ The great obstacle
to all progress both in Ireland and England is the
landlord spirit, which is dominant in political and
social life. It is this spirit which prevents our
dealing with the question of tenure, of land. 1 he
feudal system as now maintained in Ireland (tor
‘Ireland’ read also ‘Skye’) is totally unsuited
to the state of the country. In fact, the feudal
policy is not carried out, for that would imply a
responsibility on the part of the proprietor to
keep and employ the people.; whereas he. is
possibly living in Paris, while his agent is driving
the peasantry from his estate, and perhaps burn-
ing their cabins. What is wanting is a tribunal
or legislature, before which the case of. Ireland
may be pleaded, where the landlord spirit is not
supremo. This is not to be found in our House of
Commons. You would be astonished, if behind
the soeaes in the committees, to. observe how
vigilant the spirit of landlordism is in guarding
its privileges. The law of primogeniture is a sort
of eleventh commandment in the eyes of onr
l°gislators.” The fact is, that although Queen
Victoria referred to the Bible as the secret of
England’s greatness, the entire agrarian Govern-
mental system is opposed to the best tenets of
that book, jpat as its foreign policy has been.
‘‘He that will not labour, neither shall he eat,”
saith tho Lord. “ He that labours shall not eat
until he that will not labour has filled his belly
and fed his dogs,” says the British law of land-
lordism. Now, the Bible doctrine conveys a
radical and unconquerable truth, and it is posi-
tively inevitable that a system which directly
violates that truth and tight must perish.
• o •
There was a time when feudal superiors had a
value, and earned a right to support. That was
when they represented a rallying power and
organizing centre for the mutual protection of the
community amidst which they lived. Hut that is
a condition long expired. They seek to maintain
all their privileges and revenues after their ser-
vices have ceased. Necessarily, there is a grow-
ing revolt against this imposture, and the distri-
bution of land in Great Britain and Ireland
among the real organizers of agrarian industry, is
as inevitable as is ice after frost. It is only by
fraud or violence that tho change can be post-
poned. Fraud has been the expedient long—
traujl in the form of false moralities thrust down
the throats of the people. But, as education
becomes diffused, such false pretences lose their
value. The number of men who can be deluded
by sham systems, or scared off by e'-aiges of
socialism and general non-respectability, becomes
yearly less. And. accordingly, force has to bo
employed by the landlord classes as a last and
desperate expedient. Thus it happens that the
landlord and plutocratic House ot Commons has
authorized the occupation of Ireland by a perma-
nent army of 50,000 men, besides an armed con-
stabulary nearly equal in numbers. And so, also,
it happens that a body of police, having first been
employed with the view of intimidating the tenants
of Skye, and having failed, it was considered cor-
tain, when the last mail left, that troops would be
dispatched to coerce those biblical rebels.
* * •
The details of the resistance offered to the in-
struments of an unnatural law in Skye corres-
ponded exactly with what has previously been ex-
perienced in Ireland. There was at f\rst the
customary sullen tacit opposition; next, menaces
of resisting extreme measures by the strong hand.
There were the same ‘‘unwomanly” women in
the foreground, with their aprons full of stones,
and the same “ unmanly ” men in the background
as a corps of reserve. It appears, therefore, that
it is not only in Ireland—whence England drew
some of her best fighting line regiments, and
whence Prance got the brigade which turned the
fortunes of the day at Fontenoy—that women are
unsexed and men without courage. The same
phenomena occurred also in Scotland, and in Skye
of all places—whence came so largo a proportion of
the fearless recruits who helped to wrest Canada
from the French. This lie is growing too big for
belief. Every man and woman who resists a
fraudulent and pieposterous compulsion to give
up some necessary of existence in order that a
total stranger—as most landlords now are to their
tenants —may loll in luxuries, cannot be as a
matter of course a coward or a shrew.
* • •
The no-rent agitation is spreading rapidly
throughout the Highlands. In Caithness a meeting
of tenants on one estate has been held where one
speaker—the oldest resident present —deliberately
declared that if matter* were not mended, little as
he favoured gunpowder or dynamite proceeding,
they would oome to that yet. These remark?, and
a frank expression of approval of boycotting as
“ a noble thing, which under one name or another
had been used since the world began" (true enough),
wore lustily cheered by an assemblage of over three
hundred—.Scotchmen. This is but tho beginning.
Men now living—men of middle age—will in ail
likelihood not die before they have learned of the
same sentiments with regard to rent —the senti-
ments of Bright and Cobden —being lustily
cheered by great assemblages of —Englishmen.
The reform which has yet to convert the Rarua-
ment of Great Britain into a truly representative
chamber, instead of a House mainly composed of
landlords, Peers’ younger sons and dependents,
and capitalists, will be the moat sweeping in its
consequences of any since Louis XVI. of Prance
consented, under necessity, to call together the
Tiers Etat— the assembly of the common people—
and could never get rid of them.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Political Jonahism.
The inti ntion of Sir Henry Parkes to play the part
of the repentant schoolboy who has Veen led into mis-
chief by bad associates, and who promises to have no
mare fellowship with tho naughty boy, is gradually
developing. As wo recoinly indicated. Sir John
Robertson is to bo made the scape-goat. Qf course,
Sir Henry does not personally take any steps or make
any sign at this stage. The public mind must first be pre-
pared. And there are always convenient instruments
to take the requisite initiative. In the Echo of Friday
last appears a letter by “An Elector of East Sydney,"
which seems designed to pave the way. “ Sir John,"
writes this elec'.or, "has politically ruined his own
reputation; but, unfortunately, he has dragged hia
colleagues with him.” Again, “ I ask, what were tho
charges against tho Government ? The most important
is the Milburu Creek scandal. Who is responsible for
this H Why, Sir John Robertson.” Once mere:
“ The last charge is the Land Bill, for which
Sir John Robertson is answerable.” Thi* attempt
to make Sir John Robertson the soape-gcat
of the late Administration is too transparent.
That Sir John Robertson’s transactions in refer-
ence to the Milburn Creek compensation were scan-
daloiu and inexcusable is true. But that he should
alone be blamed, while on behalf of his colleagues a
tacit pica that they were his innocent victims, is too
impudent a device. There was at least a manly
audacity about Sir John’s proceedings which com-
mands a certain admiration—the sort of admiration
which one concedes to a dashing highwayman who
retreats fighting, as compared with the contempt
which is the due of his accomplice who, on being con.
fronted, fires at his mate, and tries to sneak out of tho
difficulty by pretending that he always meant to betray
him to the police, and who, nevertheless, as soon as the
danger is over, joins with .him again. Next, there is
tho Land Bill. The correspondent of the Echo cun-
ningly assumes that that wrecked the Ministry, al-
though. it is patent to the whole country that tho
Ministry went to pieces in the billows of the general
election, not more because its land policy was dis-
credited "than because it was rotten from truck to keel.
Sir John Robertson comes out, as regards the Land
Bill, more creditably than most of his colleagues, and
especially more creditably than Sir Henry Parses.
It is plain to the meanest intelligence that Sir John
really believed in the system proposed to be perpetuated
by that ridiculous Bill I and in endeavouring to impose
it upon the country, he was at least consistent. But
the same cannot be said of Sir Henry Parses. If ho
did not believe in the Bill, he is chargeable with tho
basest kind of political imposture in lending his influ-
ence to foist upon the public a measure which he knew
or believed to be injurious to the colony, and calculated
to retard its progress and development. Sir Henry is
in a dilemma. If he believed in the Bill, he, as Premier,
is equally with Sir John Robertson bound to abide
now by the decision of the country that it is bad in
policy. If he did not believe in it, he stands convicted
of a subordination of principle to love of office, and a
sacrifice of the public interests to serve his own con-
venience, which has had no parallel in the history of a
public man. “An Elector” is singularly unhappy in
his reasoning. Intending apparently to show that Sir
John Robertson should be thrown overboard as a fool,
he manages to demonstrate that unless Sir Henry
Parkes was a fool also, he must have been a most pro.
digious rascal.
Mr. Joseph Mitchell, Fidel Defenson.
5Tb. Joseph Mitchell has our bitterest congratula*
lions. He has scrambled back into Parliament at the
cost of all which makes a public station worth having.
Mr. Mitchell is now a representative man. He has
the distinguished honour to represent a combination
of all the persons, systems, and prejudices which most
men of sensibility or self-respect would wish to disown.
No single section of those who united to return Mr.
Mitchell is separately strong enough to force its
nominee upon the country, and each section would
angrily resent an allegation that it maintained sym-
pathy or fellowship with the other. If it be an honour
to be the elect of the Party ef Corruption, of the ad-
herents of Religious Intolerance, of the avengers of
selfish disappointments, then Mr. Mitchell is
honoured indeed. He re-enters public life fettered with
every obligation from which a self-respecting man
would most ardently desire to be free. He is bound by
; chains of thankfulness to the ring of underhand plotters
of which Mr. John Davies is the embodied essence.
Ho is hobbled with links of obligation to the
ex-Ministry of Corruption whose mercenaries helped
him to a victory whieh, without their aid, he could
never have gained. He is pledged to continue the
servant of Jhe bigots who prefer that the hands of

than that good government be accepted from any man
who does not at least profess to agrca with their

tain Sutherland, and Pastor Allbn, and to which he

public career, and have indirect advantages which,
perhaps, Mr. Mitchell has not reckoned. A man who

have his subsequent career watched with curious
attention. Mr. Mitchell, therefore, maybe sure that
any forthcoming evidences of such abilities as he mav
possess, and developments of the remarkable, although
somewhat mingled, principles which he represents,

observation.
Nostrum and Rostrum
In opening the new Convent at Newtown, Dr. Vaughan
spoke at some length upon what ho made a ve.rata quo s
tio, the claim of the Catholics to a grant from 11a
Treasury In aid of their own religious teaching. But I r.
Vaughan’s panacea is only a nostrum. Payment ly
results, as he euphemistically puts it, is neither m< re
nor less than a huge system of “cram.” A schoi 1.
master, in order to succeed, has to bring his pupils i p
to the mark in a number of subjects, and taking in o
account the differing capacities of children, the
tractiveness or otherwise of diff .rent studies, this
results in cramming, pure and simple. If it were put
as a simple issue to the people of this colony: “Arc
you prepared to pay largely for a system of unmiti-
gated cram ?” the answer would be : “ No, we have too
much of it already to desire mere.” But as to
the larger issue—is it desirable that a large section
of the colonists should be encouraged to feel themselves
wronged and overridden by bigotry, and to segregate
themselves from their fellow-colonists in consequence ?
—it is not possible to be so confident in replying. If it
was ever thought that Boman Catholicism could be
destroyed by the passing of the Education Bill, that
liope must now be abandoned. The Catholic children
are now fastened, in the majority of eases, under the
priests’ thumbs—a very undesirable state of things, as
we will discover in the future. Under the old Council
of Education we had some guarantee that the teachers
of Denominational schools were competent. How are
we to know that these “Brothers" and “ Sisters ” and
“Fathers” and “Mothers” of Dr. Vaughan’s importa-
tion are fitted for the posts to which he proposes to
assign them ?
What Can We Do?
The Her. Mr. Jefferis, in his capacity of Chaplain-in-
Ordiuary to the 8.M. Herald, has been chiding that
journal for venturing obscurely to hint, in reference
to the drunken girls and boys lately discovered in
Moore Park, that the Churches are inefficient. “What,"
cries Mr. Jepfebis, “can the Churches do while the
magistrates permit casinos and dancing saloons to
exist without adequate supervision ? ’’ Poor Mr.
Jeffbris 1 Poor impotent Churches 1 Can you really
do nothing ? Do you thus admit your inefficiency ?
Suppose Mr. Jefferis and his churchwardens were
just to undertake that supervision which he complains
that the magistrates neglect. Surely his Master
never counted on the magistrates. Suppose Mr.
Jefferis and his office-bearers were to present them,
selves regularly at that “dancing saloon within fifty
yards of my church every night of the week except
Sunday," and have some quiet talk with the better
disposed of the young folks. Impracticable, of
course. Mr Jefferis would be tired ont, and unable
to preach or conduct the services on Sunday.
Well, suppose he let the Sunday service slide.
Does he imagine that his Maker objects to services
rendered on week days ? The Churches are inefficient
because they have become slaves to routine and for-
malities. That dancing saloon so near at hand is
clearly of more essential and practical concern than
the Sunday recitations to and by a well-to-do crowd of
people, who are surely saved already, if Mr. Jefferis
and a course of Sunday can save them at all.
But this is a reductio ad absurdum. We offer a prac-
tical expedient. Young people will dance and romp,
and have fun generally. Nature—that is to say Provi-
dence—has so ordained. And if they can’t satisfy the
innocent mercurialism of their youthful blood, nerves,
and muscles, under good auspices, they will, unless
kept under severe and hateful discipline, satisfy that
tendency where they can. When the Churches recog-
nise fun as proceeding from God, and dancing as harm-
less and necessary, and flirting as a pleasant, innocent,
and natural preliminary to wedlock, they will cease to
be inefficient. Let Mr. Jefferis open his church for a
dance and a romp twice a week, under good-humoured
and human supervision, and lead off the quadrilles
himself, and we will warrant that in three months that
saloon next door will close for lack cf patronage, while
he will be able to reckon more genuine winnings of
souls than if he continues to preach and cry “ what can
the Churches do" all his life.
Clarke and Clayton.
Some of these London papers have a very happy way of
saying disagreeable things. Thus one:—"I suppose
that the baronetcy which has been conferred on Mr.
William John Clarke, of Rupert's Wood, Victoria, is
intended as a mark of honour to the colony, the now
baronet being, it seems, one of the richest men in
Australia. It is rather odd, though, to read of a sheep,
farmer receiving a baronetcy, and «n eminent physician
being made a knight. I hope Sir Oscar Clayton will
not be offended.” We hope not, also. It is according
to precedent, by the way, to make doctors knights and
rich men baronets. It matters not whether these rich
men be sheep-farmers or sheep. This is the shoddy age.
People nowadays pay no respect to merit minus money.
It is easy to test this. If you see a man whom you know
staring at some other who is passing by, and ask him
“ Who is that ?"—it is ten to one he will reply, ‘‘Oh,
that s So-and-so—any amount of money." He doesn’t,
you will remark, say that the person spoken of thus
has done anything worthy of beiug remembered, but
merely that he happens to ha the possessor of a
certain number of coins used in commerce. It is
no use striving to struggle against this sordid style of
viewing things. Money is the god of the many, and
not even God can mate the many the few.
“Deaders.”
There are several ways of being dead* Thus, on© may
be politically dead, morally dead, “ dead-broke,” and
so on. We could give instances of versons in each of
these states, but we think we had better not. la add!
tion to these particular ways, however, there are two
which are general to the human race—physical death
and mental death. A German scientist has just dis-
covered the division between these two states. He did
it by applying electric currents to the muscles of
corpses. Until persons are physically dead, the
muscles continue to contract. These contractions,
according to his experiments, disappear seventy-five
minutes after mental death at the quickest, and six
and a half hours at the slowest. The question that
now arises is, what is that mental corpse doing in the
meantime? We give it up ourselves, but an eminent
savant of this city has informed us that it is possible
to prolong the lower animal life when the higher—that
is, the life of the intellect—is extinct. Instances of
this are rare, but they are met with occasionally.
Thus, in the Island Audras, in the Greek Archi-
pelago, some short time ago, it was stated that several
persons recently buried had been seen in the streets.
The Greek superstition is that the dead never leave
their graves without intending to work mischief to the
living. Consequently, the noble villagers turned out
with axes and spades, opened t he graves cf the suspected
corpses, and cut their heads and limbs oil. Ic is pro-
bable, we imagine, that, in their altered state—being
minus a mind, as we conceive it —the dead may not he
able to recognize the race of tVe living In fact, th 3j
may possibly consider us who have intelligences as evil
spirits. We are the more inclined to believe this from
certain cases of 1 fe-in-d ath walking round among us
of Sydney. They ara usually found in politics, and
make all living men their prey And they are mentally
and spiritually dead, being without soul or b'ains It
h a pity that a short-sighted and uuphilosophical law
prevents us frjm interviewing them with spides and
ixe i.
Poor Devils!
A young man was fcmn I lying in a state of in• ensibility
on ths Bulli road lately. He died shortly after
being removed. O i a leaf of his note-book these words
were written:—“I am reduced to this —this is the
fourth day upon one meal; the last shilling went fra
bed last n'ght. I am now frying to walk it to Plcton
without a stiver, although it has cost me near £400
between doctors and deaths.” They found on his per.
son a purse containing 31, a ‘‘love charm," a lock of
brown hair plaited and tie I w.th blue ribbon, the por-
trait of a woman, and a railway ticket. Poor devil 1
His story is unsensational because it is so familiar.
He is only one of hundreds who have died and will die
in a similar way. It is fate. There are certain men
who are doomed from the day of their birth. They
will lit into no groove—;an tako up no part of the com-
mon burden that civilization imposes upon their
fellows, but are Zingari, wanderers all through their
short and cheerless lives. They are marked out for
destruction as certainly as the other nomads of the
earth. They may have all qualities of mind and body
that heart could di sire—be brilliant of wit and inex.
haustible of resource—but they fail where other men,
whose names one would not mention in the same
breath with theirs, succeed easily. What is that talis-
manic something that is lacking in them ? It is not
perseverance in all cases, for we have known men of
this sort who have been marvels of concentrated energy
and yet have died in ditches. It seems, somehow, as if '
they have been sent into the world unkneaded—every '
constituent part of the full man is there, but the parts
will not work together. Or, is it that evil stars met in
their horoscope—are they the victims of ill luck ? These
are questions no man may answer. All we can do is to
close their eyes—throw a stone on their cairns—sigh
“ poor devils," and leave them to the mysterious Pates.
An English piper stated, in a matter-of-course way, that'
the late Archbishop of Canterbury was to bo placed in
receipt of £5000 a year for life, besides being allotted a
life interest in Addington Park. Also, that he would
*' probably be elevated to the rank of a Baron, if not a
Viscount." Very nice news, indeed—for the devil, the
world, and the flesh. We don’t remember reading that ;
the Archbishop's Lord and Master was ever made a
Biron or a Viscount of, or ** elevated " in any way.
But then He was only the son of a common carpenter,
anyhow. In connection with this item about his lata
Grace, Just read this Private Roberts, who rode at
the charge of the Light Brigade, was followed to his
grave by six hundred persons. Private Roberts would
not have been in his gravo now, but that he died
of starvation, being unable to work or to obtain any
relief from those of his countrymen who knew his
poverty." And this was one of England's heroes—a
mm who went into the "mouth of hell" for her.
Whan he showed his soars, and claimed assistance
from his countrymen, they practically told him
to go to hell again. The man who preaches peace,
and feeds on rich moats, is made a millionaire and a
peer: the man who fights for his country in her hour
of need, is left to starve in the streets and die in a
ditch. Which of these two would yon rather be, dear
reader ? We knew which wo would, and it wouldn’t be
his greasy Grace. Pah 1 It is time the devil began
his reign in earnest.
A woman living in Freemantle, W.A, made her little
child, hardly three years old, drunk with brandy, the
other day. The local paper says, “ When the brutal
woman, being unable to maintain her equilibrium,
dropped her child on the footpath, the miserable little
one was literally unable to crawl on its hands and
knees, but kept tumbling over at every attempt it
made to move, while its feeble cries and piteous moans
were heartrending to hear.” We have seen things
quite as shocking as this much nearer home. We have
seen babies that were weaned on whisky, and babies
that were roared on rum. This statement is not over,
proof. Let anyone who wishes to collect statistics on
this subject go through the lanes off Lower George,
street, Sussex-street, Kent-street, and such like neigh-
bourhoods, and drop casually into one of the bars there,
and he will see squalid-faced, shovel-shoed slatternly
women tramping about with children that are just
able to walk, at their hee’s. Let him watch them a
moment, and he will see them call for a pint of beer or
a nobbier of brandy—more often brandy, because it is
fiery and puts more life into their drink-chilled bones
A ery well it is not very well to see these poor crea-
tures poisoning themselves—yet, after all, they are
perhaps too old to mend; but, heavens above I look at
them handing the glasses to their children to taka the
first drink. Is it a wonder that the offspring of
these unfortunate people are miserable, rat-like little
wretches, who are debauched old men when they
should be in the prime of life ? We are not teetotallers
nor total abstinence advocates, and don’t intend to be j
but this kind of thing is calculated to make the blood of
the most callous run oold. Up in Newcastle it used to
be—if ifc isn’t now—a custom among the wives of the
“ underground savages,” when they came into town, to
go into the first pah. and call for a pint of beer for
themselves and another for the poor little youngster
that wai toddling along beside them. But the practice
of giving drink to children is not confined to the
canaille. It prevails even in what are called “ respect-
able " families. In the days of our rude forefathers,
women who would thus have made premature drunk,
ards of their offspring would have been tied to the tail
of a cart and whipped from one end of the town to the
other. But we are too civilized and refined to do this.
The Local Option League have met, and amongst other
portions of their programme, they propose that “it
shall be within the scope of the League to defend the
beneficial clauses in the existing or any future Licens-
ing Act, and especially the entire closing of public houses
on Sunday." The League had better stick to what its
name weuld suggest, and not constitute itself into a
General Commission, composed of, as it is sure to be,
and certain'y managed ultimately by, the omniscient
John Davieses, who are found in swarms wherever a
League of this kind comes about. The responsible
framers of licensing laws, who are now sent into Parlia-
ment pledged to certain alterations, will, unless this
universal commission be curtailed, find themselves
again outwitted by irresponsible “ know-alls.”
We observe that Louis Kossuth is dying He was an
Egyptian—we mean Hungarian—patriot, who vainly
at'empted to give effect to the national aspirations of
hir count’ymen. He was promptly dubbed a rebel, and
his attempt being eas'ly crushed by superior mili.
tary powe-, he passed the rest of his existence in
exile in Colombo —no, Turin,
The 3. M. Herald and its bantling, the Echo, are greatly
perturbed at the evidences forced upon them, by recent
events of the efficacy and influence of the style of
downright journalism introduced by The Bulletin.
The Parkes Government, according to these fossil
papers, “ was not knocked down —it knocked itself
down ’’ It won't do, Granny. It’s no use to fancy
because you have never been able to floor anyone
by fluttering your umbrel'a,that, when you see a rogue
lying on bis back trying to keep his nose from swelling,
and an active young party is standing over him with
clenched fists, the rogue lay down of his own
accord. For all the check the namby-pamby of the
Herald has ever been on political or other (say Cion-
tarfy) impostors, the Parkes Ministry might have
been in office for years to come, the Domain sold
private’y to one of the Calico Jimmies and cut up
into building allotments, and the harbour leased for
ninety-nine years to Watson’s third cousin.
There Is a curious unintentional satire upon the manner
in which wsr was commenced against the Egyptians in
the letter on English and Foreign Affairs published in
the S M Herald of Friday last. The Herald s cor-
respondent, treating of the attitude of France towards
Midagascar, remarks that “the Temps acknowledge
that France has uocla'm to a protectorate unless ‘open
hostilities’ on the part of the Hovas release ber from
her obligations. We may fully appreciate the meaning
of the two words just qnoted, when we bear in mind
that the French fleet has been ordered from Zanzibar
to the Malagasy coast, for if the Hovas defend them-
selves against attack, the ‘ open hostilities ’ above
suggested will be immediately established." Just so.
This seems to intimate that the French fleet will steam
into some Madagascar equivalent for the port of Alex-
andria ; then, if the natives commence to erect batteries,
pronounce their conduct outrageous and tantamount lo
open hostilities; next, gallantly bombard the half-
finished works, receive on board any cowardly viceroy
who may fancy himself most out of the way of bullets
on board the vessels of his country’s assailants; and,
having secured him, pronounce the entire people
rebels, and, when their national leaders are captured,
hang them—unless to do so would create too atrocious
a scandal, and in the latter case get the cowardly Cur
who came to them to formally degrade the Patriot, and
then exile the Man for life, and prop up the Hound as
Sovereign alias Bailiff.

Marine Board Firmness.
The following characteristic decision has been
given by the Marine Board in the Kembla-Rose-
dale collision “ The Board therefore found Mr.
Tyrrell, mate of the liosedale, guilty of serious
default in porting the holm when he should have
starboarded , and Captain Prendergast, of the
Rosadale, in that he did not alter the course ; and
Captain Anderson, of the Kembla, in that he did
not do as he should have done in order to keep
out of the other vessel’s way in accordance with
the regulations. They therefor® severely repri-
manded these officers, and cautioned them to be
more careful in the future.” Auy body of men at
this time of day who could get off a decision of
this kind deserve to have their own certificates
suspended for six months.

ONE OF THE WOBLD'S GEEATEST
OAESMEN.
IN a recent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one of the foremost Journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Trickett, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following as his opinion.
•• I have found St. JACOB’S 01 < a sure and certain
cure, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in back, brought on by over-ex.
ertion in rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without farther trouble.’*
The writer listened attentively to tha above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what he was talking about; and now he ways
that St. JACOB’S OIL and good athletic training, ar
what all our young men want.

Louis Goss, the most extensive cattle dealer in
the Eastern counties of England, died recently at Ips-

remarkable method of hieroglyphics invented by him-
self for keeping his accounts, and was able to boss a
business that turned over half a million annually.
Madame Christine Nilsson-Rouzaud is about to
be married to Senor Angel de Miranda, a young Parisian

The Earl of Shrewsbury has been expelled the
Derby County Club. They are all moral men in that
olnb.it seems, and don’t intrigue with anyone excepting
ballet-girls and seamstresses. The A ustralian Club here
is equally moral. By the way, does poor old Baker still
belosg to it P We heard he was requested to resign on
the motion of Tom Garrett, seconded by John Davies.
The mother of the late Princesse Roland Bona-
parte died some time ago The doctor, however, is re-

very ominous words —"Je crois." Tha Prinoe has now

The Marquis of Queensberry, who was put out
on his head for interrupting Tennyson’s “ Promise of
May ’’ at the Loudon Globe, is, it seems, ene of a
family, most of whom have been considered to be a
little bit ott their kadoovas. The Marquis is a Free-
thought mau, his wife is a Revivalist, and his brother a
Roman Catholic priest. Nobody seems to know what
his aunt is. Probably a dean.
Lord Charles Scott, who is stated to be on his
way out to marry Miss Ryan, of Melbourne, has re-
turned to tha Admiralty the special allowance granted

Jules Joubert, the Exhibition man, late of
Joabert and Twopsny, is in Calcutta, working up the
proposed Exhibition there. Ha writes bitterly and
sarcastically of the Hindoo natives, describing them as
the most cunning of Oriental swindlers. He is quite
shocked at the airs of “ assumed inferiority the Natives
put on in order the bettor to swindle the poor deluded
Europeans,’’ who are “ simple enough to swallow such
humbug." Jules absolutely “loathes the country,’’
and avers that Calcutta is a city of humbug I
From the N. Y. Daily News, of 27fch Novem-
ber;—"in the Supreme Court, to-day, Mrs. Josephine
Bright was granted by Judge Donohue an absolute
divorce from her husband, Charles Bright, and the
custody of the children was awarded to her. Mr.
Bright made no appearance or defence, though duly
served with the papers. Mr, Bright is the lecturer
from Australia who figured prominently as a speaker
and lecturer at the Freethinkers’ Convention at Wat-
kin’s Glen last Summer."
Little Bailey, of Temora, is unhappy. He says
a mine in which he has 3000 (!) shares has gone to satisfy
a verdict of fifty shillings. “ It is for us to unmask the
villainy embodied in this vile and dem®niacal conspiracy,
to tear aside the cloak which has so long concealed the
rapacity of these fiends in human form, these vultures,
thesoghquls, these vampires " Hodoesn’t say all this,
doesn’t little Bailey, but he moans it. Why, it is said
up there that he breathed so hard when writing an article
on the Shamrock and Enreka that ho sent two slabs
clean out of the southern wall of tho editorial sanctum.
The Hereditary Prince of Monaco (who ia Em-
P et ° r °f a country about as large as Wynyard-equare

gambling hell ) is going to marry again. Ho was freed
Lady Mary Hamilton, his last wife, by special
fapal dispensation, and is on the look out again for
something in the muslin line. The Prince, by the way,
commences his proclamations—“ We, Charles III., by
me grace of Qod, Sovereign Prince of Monaco.” We’d
like to hear what Mr. Jefferis would say to this. That
13 it he wouldn’t say it too long.

Jeremiah Dwyer, for years a well-known figure
in Victorian politics, is dead. Poor old Jerry I No more
will bis pro-Catbolio denunciations ring in the Assembly
but ever more will he repeat what he always did of
yore—absent himself when the crucial division on the
E location question came on. It was too ticklish a
test to be faced. He was a frothy debater, but a
strong lobbyist. His constituency, after several disas-
trous failures, was the Villiers and Heyteabury, and
he was there revered for hia shill at local log-rolling,
his sonorous voice, his gaudy watch seals, and his
portly presence. He was an indifferent barrister, but
a money-making “agent." He married a lady with
money, went insolvent a little while afterwards in re
a distillery spec , and towards the end of his days
acquired a very red nose. Vale, Jerry 1 R.I.P.
Up on the Endeavour Eiver, N.Q., there is a
veteran of the Franco-Qerman war—Mr. Asmus—who,
although still in the prime of life, has seen plenty of
aotivs service. He fought in seven of the hottest
battles in 1870-1, besides Toeing present at all the princi-
pal sieges and most of the skirmishes. At Gravelotte,
the company of the 8th Yagers, to which he be'onged,
was almost destroyed by the French sharpshooters and
batteries. When the muster roll was called after
battle, Mr. Asmus, who was No. 30, was the first te
reply 11 Here," and from him to No. 52 was another
ghastly gap. In February, 1871, the Yagers occupied
ths Ardennes. Corporal Asmus and a comrade were
quartered on a farmer, and slept aide by side on a
mattress in the upper storey of the farmhouse. One
night, Asmus was awakened by feeling a hand groping
over bis face, and hearing what sounded like retreating
footsteps. He roused his comrade and procured a
light. They found no intruder, but buried to the hilt
in the mattress was a hunting-knife—with a ghastly
blade eight inches long. It had passed between his
left arm and his side, and was doubtless the work of a
Franc Tireur, Mr. Asmus holds a medal and certificate
for honourable services.
“General” Booth, of the Salvation Army, has
become a man of the day. He is now recognised as a
person who cannot be crashed with jeers, because ha
has a following at his back who do not understand
jeers. They are fanatics. Fanatics are madmen. And
madmen are open to no persuasion other than strait-
waistcoats and leg-irons. Is he mad? Not much. He
now pays out a trifle of £18,000 a year for the mere rent
of rooms for Salvation services. And yet it is said he is
proud of being a very poor man. They all are till they
get enough coin together to enable them to cut Christ.
Christ is no fit associate for a rich man. The rich men
of his day did not even consider Him respectable. The
“ General’s " history, like that of all great men, is a
varied one. First he was an Anglican, then a Wes-
leyan, and lastly a Cone-hander. His authority over
his religion-crazed rabble is as absolute as that of the
Grand Lama is over his spiritual subjects. His first
and last beatitude is “ Blessed are the bedevilled—rake
in the pool." It is said his chief charm for the people
rests in his interpreting the Gospels “in an airy and
generous way" In appearance, the “ General," judg-
ing by the pictures we have seen of him, is a lean-
cheeked, lank-haired, blue-nosed, wet-eyed, middle-
aged monomaniac. But there is a first-class business
method about his madness.
In New York, the other day, it so befel that,
dining at the Lotos Club, we saw at the next table no
less notorious a person than Oscar Wilde. Oscar is a
fearful sell, so far as appearances are concerned. He is
a big, slab-sided, raw-boned young man, with a (ace as
long as a horse’s, and a coarse-grained skin. His nose
is a prolonged aquiline, with a bridge abont as long as
Garbett’s North Shore one would have been. At the
Lotus it Is de rigucur to dine in evening dress, and
Oscar’s bony frame was costumed in the ordinary dress
ooat and waistcoat of the period, large stand-up shirt-
collars, wide and low at the throat, and drooping, lily,
fashion, at the corners. His pantaloons wore ont very
tight, and ho sported a watoh.fob, with pendant seal,
in the style of our grandfathers. When ho talks and
laughs, ho shows a dentist-window display of white but
irregular and prominent teeth. Thera isn't an atom of
grace or flexibility in his figure or carriage. His feet
would be invaluable on a goldfield as quartz-orushers.
Vernon, as Bunthorne, ia a sylph when compared with
the Great Original. Oscar has done very well in
America. His lecturing biz., —it is really an exhi-
bition of himself as a monstrosity—has brought in
30,000 dollars (£6000), which is not gain, as ha has not
had occasion to break into that money at all, his private
means sufficing for bis general expenses. Osear has the
figure of a clodhopper and the face of a Sawny, but a
Sawny of the Yorkshire variety. He looks the sort of
man that one would take for a fool—at first, and lament
the mistake later. He has had serious thoughts of
visiting Australia, and had actually closed with a specu-
lator’s offer to run him hers; bat he backed ont, and
reserves this continent till the remoter parts of Yankee-
land shall be worked out.
There was a considerable flare-up at Honolulu
when the City of Now York o&lled there on a recent
voyage. The Honorable the (local) Postmaster-General
was booked as a passenger te ' Frisco, en route tor Japan,
to which country he was proceeding as Commissioner
to arrange for labourers. Hia Excellency is a full-
blooded Kanaka, and highly connected, so that a
number of the greatest personages in the realm came
aboard to give him a handsome shove otf. His Most
Excellent Majesty the King, Kalakaua I., was on board
among the first, attended by a numerous and piebald
suite, who made the saloon resound with the Anourrican
and Tahitian languages. His Majesty was graciously
pleased to be attired in a suit of whits duck, consider-
ably too tight for so great a monarch ; and it was his
Royal pleasure to assimilate quite a regal whaok ont of
three bottles of champagne. There was no formal re-
ception, but the monarch vouchsafed to converse with
several of the passengers, introduced by no loss a
dignitary than the steamer’s chief steward. As the
night advanced, a native quartette got up a farewell
serenade in honour of the Honorable the Postmaster-
General. The instruments were a violin, a fall-sized
guitar, a half-size ditto, and a banjo; and the execu-
tants sang all the time. The violinist was either ad
white or so little brown as to lead to the supposition
that if he bo a native, his grandmother had accidentally
met a Kanaka, and told him to leave her alone. The
hero of the evening was, however. His Excellency S. K.
Kaai, Minister for Finance, the second personage in
the Government. His Excellency had looked upon the
wine when it is red, or else upon the whisky-cobbler
when it is yellow, and was vulfaring from a surplus.
His condition was nearly as elevated as his station, and
at the moment he reminded all the New South Welsh-
men ou board of thair own Finance Minister, Jimmy
Watson, because it was the consumption of liquor to
which Kaai owed his “ elevation.” His Excellency and
the Honorable the Postmaster General, in accordance
with a pleasant custom, wore ronnd their hats beautiful
wreaths of flowers, and their necks, breasts, and
shoulders were completely swathed in maeaes of similar
wreaths. As jessamine and rose-buds entered largely
into the structure of these wreaths, their Excellencies
were the sweetest Kanakas ever smelt by the nose of a
white man. His Excellency the Finance Minister, who
seemed to be perpetually trying to strike (and keep)
his b&'ance, swayed vaguely around the saloons. Anon,
he would enter with a lurch through one door, and
g are amiably but indefinitely at whoever happened to
be handy, and anon he would wander otf the gang-
way and deliver a stirring address in his native tongue
to the mixed crowd of fruit-sellers and wharf-loafers
assembled. Then it would occur to him to come back
and kies his departing colleague; and, by and bye, it
would strike him that a serenade would about fill his
cup. Accordingly, the musio struck up afresh, and two
gentlemen of colour, in moleskins and Crimean shirts,
who may have been heads of Departments, favoured
with a little dance, which was much appreciated bv
Royalty and other dignitaries. This fandango is called
the Hula-hula, and ultimately the figures became of
such a sultry description that all the ladies felt it neces-
sary to retire —aud view the balance through their state-
room Venetian blinds.
A lot of things are beginning to be said about
Mrs. Langtry, and some ot the New York papers even
go so far as to state with regard to Mrs. Labonchere
that she is only Miss Henrietta Hodson. Anyhow, the
latter lady has “ lit up ” on her friend, and has gone
back to England. Mr». L is accused of “carrying on "
with a Mr. Frad. Qobhardt la Naw York, and with hav-
ing given Sir George Chetwvnd a lot of—well—en-
ooaragement in England. We don’t know anything
about Mr. Qebhardt, except that he ie said to have
£80,000 a year, but we know a lot about Sir George.
Only a young man now, ho is «ne of the foremevt
patrons of the tnrf, and has the reputation «f being
more than excessively giddy. A long time ago, he
made himself notorious by an intrigue with the tallest
blonde on tho London stage. Miss Amy Sheridan, but
on the death of the Marquis of Hastings, he “ ranged ’’
himself—as Thackeray hath it—by marrying the Mar-
quis* widow, wife Lady Florence Paget—an event
which gave rise to a good deal of jocularity. The
Marchioness was quite a celebrity on her own account.
Prior to wedding Lord Hastings, she had been engaged
to Mr. Henry Chaplin, the great sporting man. Well,
she happened to drop across the Marquis, whom she
fancied more, and one afternoon, being out shopping
with her pritendu, she stopped the carriage at Swan
and Edgar's, the drapers in Regent-street, and leaving
Mr. Chaplin in the carriage, cleared with the Marquis
by another door, and got married by special license.
Then Mr. Chaplin swore be would ruin his rival, but at
first all the luck seemed to go with the Marquis, as a
successive string of his horses—Pall, Lady Elizabeth,
The Earl, and others won everything before them. But
when Mr. Chaplin's Hermit won the Derby (starting at
100 to 1) one year, and Lord Hastings* Lady Elizabeth
(starting at 6 to 4) was nowhere the next, the bottom
tumbled out of the Marquis’s chest, and he was a broker.
Whether Mrs. Langtry " carried on ” with Sir George
or not it is impossible to say; but we should think
not. Otherwise, she would never have lasted as long as
she has. Her life, however, independent ef any flirta-
tions she may indulge in. Is, according to several papers,
a contemptible one, siaoe she lived with Mr. Langtry
autil there was no more coin, and then shunted nim.
It is not surprising, anyhow, that the two women
should have had a row, because, while Mrs. Langtry is
undeniably a beautiful woman, Mrs. Labouohere, be-
sides being in the sere and yellow leaf, has a figure like
a top-boot (the longest waist ever seen—thus her nick-
name, ** the Sausage "), and a cast of features devoid
of attractiveness. On the stage, in a fair wig, hew-
ever, she makes up exceedingly well. It is said that
Mrs. Langtry has very good reasons for separating
from her husband) bat the same was said of Mrs.
Boueby, who also narrowly escaped becoming fashion-
able, but a passion for the nobility, backed up by one
for "three star," settled her little hash very quickly.
She left Mr. B., in Plymouth, “ to manage a theatre
belonging to Lord He wry," and whenever her hub.
(who certainly was a shocking bad actor) called after-
wards she was never at ho me. Well, she’s dead now,
Eoor thing; and Bousby is doing thunder and gore
uslness at a minor th-atre! Wo wonder where the
Langtrys will be, say, twenty years hones. Who can
tell?
The Honorable John Gox Bray, Premier of
South Australia, a prominent political figure in that
colony for some time past, is the son of a shoemaker.
Old Bray, shrewd, good craftsman, and money-making,
acquired town acres, shut up his oobbling-shop ia
Hlndley-street, retired from business, betook himself
to the old country, and presently made his resy-oheeked
boy his agent. That youth articled himself to a good
legal firm in Adelaide, and, after passing bis examina-
tion, went into partnership with the astute, though
oroohetty, J. B. Sheridan—who, by the way, has more
law in his little finger than most Adelaide lawyers
have in their whole anatomies, though he is bat a poor
pleader. J. C. Bray was never at any time more than
a second-rate solicitor. He soon left the best part of
the law business of the firm to Sheridan, and embraced
politics. The electors of East Adelaide made him
their representative, being anxious to give a promising
young colonial a good chance. He began his political
career very badly, indeed, by perha ps as deliberate an
instance of "ratting” as over digraoed local par-
liamentary action. A porfervid Oppositionist of the
then standing Ministry, Bray, in hm eager desire for
office, actually accepted an offer, eleverly made him, to
fill a vacancy which occurred in the administration.
By this step he earned the contempt and ridicule of all
parties; and, until the last year or two, the comic
pictorial journals (such as they are) in Ade-
laide represented the unwise member for East
Adelaide under the image of a mighty mean
rat. The Ministry he truckled to remained but a very
little time in power, and lor long enough J. C- Bray
was forced to play a waiting game, while gradually his
apprentice-like imprudence became forgotten. This
interval was properly utilised, for at the present time
no member of Parliament is better acquainted with the
tricks and niceties of legislative usage, nor is more
skilful or readier to avail himself of such knowledge.
Bray’s first real tenure of office was as Attorney-
General in Colton’s unsatisfactory Ministry of 1876-7;
and then, though never gaining any individual influence,
it was felt that he had forged clearly ahead of the ruck,
and would probably occupy a more important position
in the future. When the “ broad and comprehensive ”
people, such as Bouoaut, Mann, Morgan, Bundey,
Hawker, Way, and Playlord, who were goiig to regene,
rate South Australia, had provided themselves with
lucrative appointments or retired from office, John Cox
Bray came to the front, and has remained there. The
curious tact ia that Bray's Ministry does not contain a
single member of sufficient personal popularity
to aid or sustain it in any way. It is a Cabinet of
mediocrities; yet continues to exist with, at present,
a fair prospect of extended power. There is
no organised Opposition, and tho Premier has taken
such advantage of the past, that a strong Opposition is
the last thing likely to happen. Bray has pro red a most
admirable tactician, and the supplest and wiliest leader
that one is likely to meet with this decade. In point of
fact, ho rules by virtue of pliability. He ascertains the
real will of the people as expressed by public meetings,
letters to the Press, and more particularly by deputa-
tions. Then the Premier takes good care that he and
his colleagues initiate legislation in accordance with
that will. Thus, ho at any moment has the country to
fall back on. No elector could ever breathe a word
against Bray’s private character. He lives among his
constituents, and is a pattern citizen, husband, and
father. Occasionally he may venture a few pound* in
the numerous undertakings started to endeavour to find
a new industry for the country of his birth; but, gene-
rally, tho Premier unobtrusively yet surely adds to his
not inconsiderable " pile," and, at least until lately, was
content to drive a hired chaise. Fate has been kind to
him as a 'public man, but has withheld some things
which granted were sweet adornments, indeed, John
Cox Bray is short of stature, being about 5 feet nothing,
and in features resembles an old faced schoolboy. He is
unable to grow a decent beard, whiskers, or moustache.
That is the skeleton in his cupboard. He has straggled
manfully against his misfortune, using every possible
means to achieve a muoh-desired end. Here, however,
tho munificent Mother withholds her hand. A wild
tangle of half-grown bristles disfigures this Premier’s
rather pleasant countenance. These hirsute marauders
remain unaltered in condition. They refuse to yield a
proper crop, whatever be the cultivation ; they refuse
to disappear, whatever be the depilatory. This is the
chief bitter, at present, in the cap of South Australia’s
Chief Secretary, John Cox Bray.

Mr. Carey, a member of the Dublin City Council, has
been arrested on a charge of murder Swinburne, the
poet, baa j net visited Paris, and made a great impres-
sion. Ho looks like a figure escaped bodily from one
of Pos’s weird “ Stories of Imagination," as all who
know the author of " Atlantis in Calydon ” and have
marked his thin and attenuated form, bis highly ner-
vous manner, his largo, dreamy eyes, his blanched lips,
and his long, long hair, neither flaxen nor red, but a
strange mixture of the two, must agree. It is said that
when Swinburne last changed residences, the chattels
he left for sale in the house he quitted included three
or four skulls, some dilapidated articles ©f furniture,
and a weird-looking mummified hand, dry and withered,
with the nails of the finger-tops smooth and polished
as from a continual rubbing. Now what, it is asked,
could our poet have wanted with this repulsive relic of
mortality ? What, indeed ? The new Parisian lion
is a young man with thin legs, who sings bis own poems
to “ a weird accompaniment.” He was discovered by
Sara Bernhardt, and she raves about him. Damala now
states that he never had a passion for poetry. He don’t
say anything about the thin legs, though.

f|10 THE ELECTORS OP EAST SYDNEY.
Gentlemen. —One of your representatives having re-
signed his seat, I have the honour to offer myself as a
Candidate for your suffrages.
Tbe result of the recent general election having made
it absolutely necessary that a now Administration
should be formed without delay, it became the duty of
Mr. Stuart, as leader <vf the Opposition, to endeavour
to carry on the Government of the country, and that
vent’em an invited me to take the office of Secretary
for Public Works—a position, as everyone will admit,
of great importance. My acceptance of this office
made it necessary, in the present state of the law, that
I should offer myself for re-election within a few days
of my suer ess against Mr. W. J. Foster and Mr.
Mi tot ell, for Newtown.
On Saturday last, after an opposition which, as
against a new Minister seeking re-election after
acceptance of office, was unprecedented in its bitter
hostility, I was defeated by 32 votes. I venture to
say that my defeat was a triumph only of unscrupulous
tactics and organized misrepresentation. Every public
man is exposed at times to unmerited abuse, but pro-
bab'y none have had to endure such a torrent of
unfounded libels as that poured out against me at every
street corner of Newtown- Although X have never,
under any circumstances, employed a Chinaman in the
whole course of my life, yet elaborate descriptions
were given of my Chinese cook and domestic servants,
while I was charged with employing Chinese “in all
my tin mines,” whereas I never was interested in tin-
mining 1o the value of one penny, and the pay-sheets of
the Long Tunnel Company—the only mine in the
district in whi.’h I am interested—will conclusively
prove that, notwithstanding the fact that work has been
vigorously carried on night and day for neatly seven
years, without one shilling of returns, there wcie never
—even to the extent of ono day—other than European
miners employed
My undisguised contempt for religious shams and
designing hypocrites was made to appear as downright
hatred to all that is sacred and religious, whereas no
man is possessed of more reverence for religion than
myself, nor does the man live who holds in greater
respect and esteem the honest convictions of every
sinct rely religious man.
Now that T appeal to you for a fair trial as a member
of tbe new Government, which Wair trial was refused
me at Newtown, it is very likely that the same under-
ground engineers—the same unscrupulous tactics will b«
employed agaiust me; but I do not feel dismayed. I
fed that I have appealed io a tribunal above their con-
trol, knowing that your Instincts of Dir play are such
as snould fitly possess the premier constituency of New
South Wales. It has been urged against me that I pre-
dicted you would elect me. The exclamation did escape
me; but it was inspired far more by a belkfinyonr
love of Justice than from any sense of my own import-
ance, and, notwithstanding my residence in Sydney for
over 11 years, I am, to the majority of yon, an eiitira
stranger. But, as I am a member of an Administration
which yon, gentlemen, have been largely instrumental
in bringing into existence, I fearlessly ask from yen an
opportunity of taking my place beside mf colleagues in
tue Parliament of the country, nnd of showing that the
head of the Government, in selecting me as a member of
his Cabinet, after long personal knowledge of my publlf
career, did not choose a man altogether unable to be of
service to the public.
The nu morons addresses I have recently delivered in
the neighbourhood of this city will probably have made
my views on the great questions of the day already
known to you; but I purpose to address you fnlly i»
various parts of the electorate before the day of election.
1 am, Gentlemen,
Your obedient servant,
HENRY COPELAND.

wore greeted with such a storm of shrieks, yells, hisses,
Groans, and oat-calls, that after repeating “Lonely I sit

midst general execration. Bat W.H L. is not the man

Oh, and here is a par. if you like. It is not im-
probable that at Easter, when Mr. Towers’ season is
nrer, and he has gone to what nine-tenths of the Mel-
bournitas call “ Tne Bi/jow,” that Mrs. Qiad-tane will
appear, with Sheridan, in the legitimate drama for a
short season. It is a long time since Mrs. Bayliss hai
appeared on the stage now ; —so long, Indeed, that there
is a general impression growing in the minds of the
public that she is more than seventeen. And this re-
sile to our remembrance (wo don’t knew why) that we
have received a letter from a Mr. Croft, who asks us to
,ay that •' E. Croft and Star (I) Combination party are
showing to crowded houses," etc., and he remains oars
truly. We were about to do this, of course 11 when we
happened to glance at tha Bombala paper (1 is letter is
dated from there), and we perceived that the Show gets
“rats " all round. Of one of the " Star Combination,"
tha paper saysu— *' Ho appears to lack the oriaiualitf of
a Toole, or the comlo faculty of Southern (sic), but he
appears to make vulgarity and impuOeaoo supply the
places of wit and humour. We are not usually averse
to the lew comia genua (sic)," but when wa discover a
particular species indnlgiag in bnffonery (sic), and
personal impudent jocularities (sic), at tho expense of
individuals in their audience, wo are inclined to think
that low ootnedy has descended very low indeed "
Well, all we can say is that if this man only act* one
half as badly as tha editor spoils, Mr Croft, of tho
"crowded houses " kad batter kill him offhand Oth<r
wise he will soon be under a ban—which, by the way,
would make him a Ban-Croft.

attended, and where the amateur element has crept in
we have been invariaffly on hand, sober and smiling.
We have assisted at the triumphs of tha Misses
Libertouchs ia the “School for Coquettes "—been
present when the Misses Eabertsou electrified all
Darling Point in “ Meg's Diversion." Wo have smiled
on Mr*. (Professor) Smith, and revelled in fiiddell.
When naval heroes have mad* love on the stage through
tho medium of the prompter, wo have looked on con-
teatcdly, and even when w* saw “ George Lnbertouche
and Charles Freer, flsqs." play “ Box and Cox” at the
Garden Palaoe, th* ugh sorely tempted, we have slain
neither of them, W* don't like performances with an
‘ amateur element" in them any better than we like
salts, bat a dose of both become at times a mvlancholy
necessity. And thus behold us, on Thursday evening
last, resplendent in hair-oil at the Gaiety Theatre, to
witness Mr. George Forbes (supported by Ksgiuald
Bloxsoine, Esq.) appear for bis benefit, prior to his
“ a Parture for England, where it seems he is going to
study his art from the best models, having, he con-
sjders, learnt all that Ned Holloway can teach, or J. F.
Keogh suggest.

There was a splendid “ downstairs ” —ladies,
of course, predominating. Indeed, we have not seen so
much silk and muslin at the Gaiety since tne last
appearance of Eeginald Bloxsome, Esq , upon those
A formidable list of pations appeared on Mr.
Jforbes’s playbill, no fewer than three Judges’ names
ugnriDg in company, more or less distinguished. This
circumstance oast a temporary gloom over the audience,
wnioa was dispelled, however, later, when it was feund
that only one judicial dignitary turned up—Sir James
ana Sir William both disappointing the company, al-
though a couple of stalls had been reserved for the
termer, and a muffler and a warm corner for the latter.
f W -r lS even announced that it was within the resources
or James D, Cox (Esq.) to produce a spittoon at a
moment s notice. Everything, in short, was on a scale
m great splendour and preparation. The piece dc res is-
nee selected by Mr. Forbes was a comedy by Stirling
£ nown to us as “ The Widow Hath," but appa-
ently known to him as “ Friend." In
nis piece, Mr. Forbes modestly elect-ui .to enact tha
loia of Major Wellington da Boots. Mrtfohn S. Clark j
in England and America, often elects to enact the Major
also. Of the two gentlemen, we think we prefer Mr
Clarke. Mr. Porhej is a young man. who was onoe a
lawyer, but who is now an aator. We believe that he
took to tbs stage in earnest immediately after the ver-
dict in The Bulletin libel case. But prior to this ho
was known as an amateur actor, and by hi* exertions in
that line, he used —like Mr. Peter Magnna—"to amuse
his friends very much. ’* As a regularaotor, Mr. Forbes,
perhaps, did not amuse them quite so thoroughly, since
he has only been entrusted, up to the present time, with
parts of a minor character. He has, however, shone
excessively as one of “ Two Citizens meeting," and his
elocution in the role of the Third Gravedigger has
boon much admired. A correspondent (jsalons, ns
doubt) tells us that in Adelaide Mr. F, played the
husband of Juliet’s Nurse, on a Vice-regal Command
night, but we are inclined to consider that our infor-
mant is playing upon what he considers to bo our
ignorance of the works of Shakespeare.
• • •
Major Wellington de Boots is rather an ambi-
tious venture for a young gentleman who (if he will
permit ns the expression) still smells of the pounce-box
And in Mr. Forbes’s case, it is only the announcement
that he is off to England “ immediate ” that makes us
inclined to forgive him. But we can’t quite forgive
him. We have gentle hearts and charitable souls, but
wo are unfortunately human. We felt this when w«
slipped down on a piece of orange-peel in the Arcade the
other day — and we more especially felt it when we saw
Mr. Forbes play Major Wellington de Boots. This is
the first time, so far as we can recollect, that we have
seen Mr. Forbes play any part; and from an attentive
study of his Major, we are almost disposed to tearfully
ask him to go back and be a wicked lawyer again. Mr-
Forbes had a comio wig; he had, too, a oomio coat, cer-
tainly, but there was a very melancholy party inside it.
And you couldn’t laugh at him for the same reason that
you wouldn’t smile at a "green” on May dav. if you
knew there was a funeral underneath it. We h&vo
Known the Major as a parson of exceeding jocularity in
many countries. Perhaps, though, he was in good
health on those occasions. Yes; that’s it. Then, ho
was very sick indeed at the Gaiety last Thursday. It
is only by adopting this supposition—by forlornly con-
juring up this hypothesis—that we can find any excuse
for Mr. Forbes at all. And having done so, we aie
going to ask him not to play Major da Boots any more.
• • •
The draw of the evening was not Mr. Forbes—
nor weuld it have been had he depicted Da Boots ever
so brilliantly; tho draw wai Mr. Reginald Bloxsome,
who played the part of Frank Faatherloy. Mr Blox-
some is a young gentleman who was onoe Private
Secretary to His Excellency, but who now plays in
pieces for his friends* benefit. And very substantial
benefit Mr Forbes derived from Mr. B,'» appearance—
the lower part of the theatre, as we Lave said, being
crowded with a gorgeous array Of fivo-bobbers, who
greeted the gifted Reginald with much palm-pat-ing
and fan-rustling whenever he made his appearance.
Mr. B. was, in fact, the hero of tho hour, and his per-
formance was quite a gorgeous piece of comedy acting.
Mr B. has the advaatagj of what is known—oh, the
stale old term !—as “a fine stage presence.” Add to
thi» a good tailor and symmetrical “ seven-loaguers,”
and the effectiveness of Master Eeglnald may be
guaged immediately. Something alive inside a coat
played Mr. Icebrook. This was labelled Dr. Byrnes.
Like the Mayor, Mr. 1 was very unwell. Ho may,
therefore, be said to have been in pood hands 1 Miss
Roan Towers was quite at home (it being her own
theatre) a* Mrs. Feat barley, and soma of her scenes
with Mr. Bloxaoma were really capital. We like Miss
Towers much better in comedy than in burlesque,
quoique you don’t see quite so much of her. Bat, then,
we a-o not of the genus petit cr&uS.

MLsa Marion Stammers made an awiul mesa of
Mrs. di Boots —not bavin* oared,.sppirnflrly, about
mastering tho text of a piece to po plaved only for
” one consecutive) night." This ho3 the effect, perhaps,
of making the Major picker than ho otherwise would
have been. Miss May Vivim was very lively as Fanny,
and Tom Buckley was very good in the little allotted to
Trap. “Toe Swiss Cottage," with Frank Towers,
Cites, and Eosa* concluded tho entertainment. Natz
Steik, the Corporal, and Lizatto were all in good hands.

Clark and Eyman, who are at the St. George’s

Demetrius; “ One lion may, when [«o] many asses

As Captain Cattle would say—" The bearing of this
here lies in the application on it.” And why not say
that Sara, who wag here with the Soldenos, is “high
kicking” at tho London “Aveuuel" And talking of
Sara, brings us (many will know why) to poor Lazar.
Well, we hear from a lady who recently visited him
that he has now been seized with tho severest symptoms
of aente mania, and it is surmised that the end (poor
Sam 1) is not very far off.

Poor old Chiarini, the circus-man, has become
stone-blind, and his show is busted up. But Alexander
Salvini, son of the tragedian, has had better look. He
made his dJbut in Chicago as Eomeo with groat success.
Herr Bandmann, however, though he did bring out a
new crowd with him from England, was a very energetic
failure in Calcutta. Not so Circus Wilson, who has
been reaping rupees there at a terrific rate.

At latest dates, the “ Clara Stephenson Com-
pany " were still at Townsville, Q , doing big business.
And what in thunder do you thiua ? But you wouldn't
think it in a year. Well, Charley Burford, of morgue
fame, has been playing “ Hamlet ” there. This is how
the local Saint Beuve speaks of tho performance :
" * Hamlet' was played last night to a good house. Tho
piec* was both well mounted and well acted. Mr.
Harford played the leading character, Hamlet, in such
a perfect manner as might be expected from such an
experienced and capable tragedian as he is.” This is
very funny. And, by the way, the company advertised
that anyone who bought a ticket for the performance
might bring in two children. Those who didn't bring
in children brought bricks. The Simms Troupe of
“ Thespians ” did pretty thin business up at Charters
Towers, Q. Perhaps this was because hainer’s Pano-
rama of tne American War was expected just after, and
people wore laying low for the presents. Eainer, by
the way, is the only enemy Zulu Thompson has in the
wide world. It is said they both thirst for each other’s
blood. Benhamo’s Circus, however, struck a large pile
up at the Herbarton, for all that.

Tho Royal management’s mozzlo ’a in again.
The business is something stupendous. No room
anywhere. Civil servants have to sit on their hats,
the “baldheads” on their opera glasses, and little
kniokcrbocker boys on their thumbs. Now, wc are
coing 1 to let you into a small secret. Don’t start!
It's uo little matter in the domestic way which
[Go on with your notice.—Ed B.] All this tre-
mendous success is due to the ensemble. And this
dovetailing of the entire thing is due only to the
untiring exertions of one man—Mr. H. Vincent. It is
not surprising, therefore, that, in recognition of
Harry’s services, Garner, Williamson, and Musgrove
have appointed him their r-anager hero. Mr. V. got
a charming letter from Williamson, in which he said
all kinds of nice things to H. H , and intimated that
he enclosed a piece of plate for the Sydney author.
Hearing this, the 8. A. went round behind with a
bledgcon, and demanded it of Vincent. Mr. V. said,
“Walk into the property-room and you shall have it."
It was a sardine-tin 1
• • •
Go to the T.R., and you will find the book re-
done fight through. Despite the sardine-tin, yon can’t
insult the Sydney author. Yon may hurt his feelings,
but yon can’t insult him. It yon were, for instance, to
accuse him of writing the Hum critiques, he would be
sad and sorry, but he would not feel insnlted unless you
throw a brick at him as well. He, therefore, has redone
his book, and written new song-verses. These versos
are mostly Reliable. It will be interesting to the public
to know that no theatre in the Antipodes has ever made
the profits in the space of time that Williamson,
Garner, and Musgrove have with “Aladdin" at the
Theatre Royal. And yet no one ever calls out “ Hor.
thaw I" and Williamson sends him a sardine-tin.
This is mean!

The acting now is good all round, but we might
suggest that some of them should speak out. Tne

habit just now. She is so used to whispering to

“ Fighting Fortune” is not likely to make Mr.
Towers' fortune at the Gaiety. It contains all the old
played-out charaoteis—the Jew, the adventurer, the
oouii ling creature who falls in love with the adventurer,
aud the virtuous victim who finally euchres the adven-
turer. Mr. Frank Towers plays the Jew. But why is
the Jaw rei-headod ? Mr. J. J. Joyee is really good as
tue Scotch msebanio. Mr. Ireland we have never—or
seldom—any reason to complain of. And Mr. Frank
Cates is always popular. So is Mr. Burton. Every
remark he makes is received with a shriek ef derision
by the audience. Miss Rosa Towers is very nice of
course as Mabel Harrington, but ehe is too tnnoh like
what she is as everything else, Wa should begin to get
tired of her if she wore not so charming in her own
character. Owing to a press of religious matter, we
cant’t spare any more spaoe for” Fighting Fortune."

handsome design by Mr. Q. B. Johnson, the well-known
Melbourne architect, has been approved of by the
du actors. It is to be hoped that when they are build-
ing this theatre they win provide sufficient means of
egress in case of fire. If this is expecting too much,
then we think they might at least guarantee that the

Tattersall’s Gold Cup.
Os page 13, we give an illustration of the Gold Cup
presented to the Tattersall’s Club by Mr. E. E. Jones,
a shrewd and fortunate bookmaker. From the illus-
tration, it will be seen that the design is simple yet
chaste and elegant, while at the same time it is appro-
priately emblamatic of the 44 Turf." The workmanship
s deft, and in merit successfully rivals the beauty of
the design. The Cap is the work of Mr. T. M. Alcock,
of the Haymarket, and fittingly sustains the high
reputation of that establishment. In height it is soma
16 inches; from the illustration the reader may obtain
an idea of the other dimensions. It is a magnificent
specimen of the jeweller’s art. The Cup was won at
the recent Tattensall’s Meeting, by the Hon. James
White’s Morpeth, which carried 6 at. 4 lb. The recorded
time of Morpeth’s performance was 8 min. 354 sec.
Mr. Jones’ liberality has stimalated others to follow

maker, baa intimated bis intention of ottering a 100.

The Vice-Regal Speech.
The announcement of the policy of the Stuart
Ministry as conveyed in the Governor’s speech is
distinctly Scotch. That is to say, it is measured
and canny. Probably no speech ever promised
less for a session, or in less magnificent language.
Yet, probably few sessions ever sawjeo muoh work
accomplished, even after the most brilliant and
rhetorical of speeches, as is promised in the
present deliverance. The speech itself, therefore,
indicates a new departure, namely, to promise
only what is possible. This gives encouragement
for hope that the oo untry will be also indulged by
the new Ministry with the novel spectacle of all
being performed which has been promised.
Unconstitutional Irregularities.
A considerable amount of inquiry has been
aroused by the covert reference, in the second
paragraph of the Governor’s speech, to certain
irregularities in the handling of public moneys.
The public will await with impatience the revela-
tions which appear likely to result from the ohange
of political management.

THE MEDALLED MYSTERT.
A DARLING POINT IDLYY.
The ballroom blazed with glitt’ring light.
Wealth, beauty, blood, were there,
And proudly stalked each gallant knight.
And smiled each woman (air.
One man was ever to the fore
With medals much decorS—
Distinctions eloquent of war.
Of skirmish, or of foray.
His mien majestic plainly told
Of valour ne’er at zero.
That he in fight was lion bold—
Each movement spake the hi ro.
To him there came an innocent.
Who asked, “ Say, noble warrior.
What noble deeds these repreteat ?
No hero o’er looked sorrier 1
His cheek blanched as hia tongue begat
This answer, whispered low,
“ Hush, these are all the msdals that

take a basin of gruel every night before he wont to bed;
and, at tho present time, John Brown goes through tho
form of bringing a basin up nightly, at the hour tho
Priuoe used to take it, and leaves it on tho table ! !
This yarn is too.thin. Her Majesty, though a good
woman, is not the one to fling away good gruel like this.
No! Here is the true story. Every night before going
to rest the Queen was in the habit of rubbing the
Prince’s nose with a tallow caudle. She has preserved
the candle, and, instead of rubbing the Prince’s nose,
keeps up the custom by rubbing John Brown’s. No
wondor John is overwhelmed with money and made a
great pet of. Fancy having one’s nose rubbed with a
caudle nightly! No one would stand this but a Shroud
man. And that because it comes so near to having a

His lordship did not discover that this gift had been

The Rev. Mr. Jefferis, who, as Archbishop in
ordinary to the Herald, is entitled, if not to admira-
tion, at least to respeot, says in a letter to our Qat
Old Friend:— “It the press will only help the pulpit
in endeavours to put down the evils of city life, some-
thing' may be done. But if the press contents itself
with criticising the Churches, I cannot see how those
evils are to be remedied." Well, we think the Churches
have had a very good show since, say, Mrs. Lot went
into the salt line to make the world good, but it hasn’t,
somehow, *’ caught on ” in the attempt. Taking
Sydney, for instance, Mr. Jefferis prays four or five
times a week, sends round the plate with religious
regularity, and takes his three meals a day, yet there
are undoubtedly giddy people of both sexes in the city;
and when you take your umbrella ton meeting of Band-
wick directors, your only ohanoo of seeing it again is to
tie a mastiff to it. Wa quite agree with Mr. Jefferis,
though, that the press oughtn’t to upset the minds of
divines by criticising them. That doesn’t do any good,
for it only unsettles the holy men. Wo really hardly
know what to suggest. As, however, wo are un-
doubtedly drifting into sin, and parsons’ prayers don’t
make us any better, we think these reverend gentlemen
had better commence trying four meals a day, with a
glass of something hot after supper. Come now I

Last week it printed a telegram informing its readers
in the Asylum who thirst for such information that one
Crookwell man had wagered another that “ he could \
not find a horse to go from Goulburn to Crookwell, a 1
distance of 30 miles, in 41 hours.” Prom the figures of f
this hot one would infer that the man challenged was
the Bum correspondent himself, and that tho other
party was certain beforehand ho (the Rum man) could
not find anyone to trast him with the loan of a horse ;
but further down we learn this was not so, but tho man
who did ride started from G julburn at 4 p.m., and
arrived at Crook well at 6 p.m., “thus winning,” as the
Rum wiseacre gravely adds, “ with a quarter of a hour
to spare." Now what wo want to know is if ho won
with a quarter ,of an hour to spare what in thunder he
did with the other two hours P He could not have been

A clergyman’s wife, Wagga Wagga, announced
that she would hold classes for the purpose of preparing
young ladies for Confirmation. A whole heap rolled up
tho first day, looking as demure as a lot of Madonnas,
and each one with a Prayer Book marked at the proper
place. The Bulletin having arrived thatmoruiug, the
lady thought she’d read them an account of a fashion-
able wadding, seasoned with a littlo pepper and salt.
When they trooped down for the next lesson, the
instructress said that they would have to take their risk
of future consequences for a day or two, as she was
making plum-jam. When they rolled up again, the
spiritual mistress gave them some lollies all round, and
read out a complete tale from tho Family Hesald.

We understand that tho distribution of the
medals to the troops by tho Queen was a gorgeous
spectacle. The flower of English chivalry supported
Her Majesty, and, when tho soldiers gazed upon their
commanders in splendour assembled, they felt that it
was indeed a proud thing to belong to the British army.
The flower of English chivalry consisted of the Prince
of Wales, wearing a Field Marshal’s uniform, bis breast
a blaze of orders gained by valour and various other
things; and the Duke of Albany, attired in the garblef
the Seaforth Highlanders, of which he is Colonel; while
the Duke of Connaught stood aloof, quarrelling with
the Duke of Teck about whioh had got to Tel-el-Kebir
soonest after the battle was over. The valorous Field
Marshal shook hands with his brother warriors, as
also did the intrepid Colonel of the Seaforth High-
landers; at the expiration of which thrilling ceremony,
Leo's Bath-ohair was announced, and he was wheeled
home to his gruel.

The Presbyterian says that “ the week of
universal prayer has been held according to arrange-
ment. In spirit and attendance the meetings have
exceeded those of previous years." We are very glad
to hear this, indeed. But if the prayer was universal
how can the attendance vary ? We have been about
a bit, but we haven’t observed that people were more
devout than usual. We went into the Salvation Army’s
place, and they asked us for something. We looked in
at Dr. Steel’s, and the ttrsh thing we saw was the plate.
At the little Catholic Chapel, Dawes Point way, a man
9 feet high, iu a green tie and a 20-inch belltopper,

“ sixpence ” is passed as one. At this rate, “ eighteen-

THE SICK LADY.
An ELECTION BALLAD.
’Twas polling-day—no matter whore—
The place wo will not quote.
And in the train were three young clerks
A going up to vote.
They had their man’s cards in their hands,
Talked loud, in manner gay.
When, lo, a very pretty girl
They saw faint clean away.
The hour was close on four, and in
The car were very few;
And oh, it took a denied time
To bring the lady to.
One fanned her, and one held her bag,
And one, please understand,
Pretended that he chafed her fair
Palm, just to squeeze her hand.
“ I’m better now j—but, gentlemen,
Oh, leave me not,’’ said the.
And just think how they buzzed around
That pocr sick thing, those three.
’Twas suddenly they started up—
“ Our station, Miss, at last! ”
“ Oh, dear no," cried the grinning guard j
“ You have your station passed."
•' Then how to vote ? ” they cried, amain;
“ Good heavens 1 we’ll be late *’
The lady was the sister of
The other candidate.

Some travelling show up Canoon way has lost a

a few minutes, during which time his dog started a pig.
The porker, instead of scooting off, coolly walked np
to the bush, laid hold of tho gun, and with the contents
of one barrel shot the dog dead, while it potted tho old
man in the arm with the charge of the other. The
learned pig then handed the gun baok to the disabled
sportsman with apologies for having to act so vigar.
ously in self-defence, hoped It would be a lesson to him
to leave secluded professors alone for the future, and
advised him to go to the Hay hospital. This is only
one of many curious adventures that happened on
Boxing Day.

It is not absolutely necessary that a strict tee-
totaller should be debarred from keeping a bottle or two

is the very height of good breeding—but it’s not geod

She was the newly-married wife of a pressman

“Ob, Sophouisbal” she cried to her sister (who had

cheese, and looked at her enquiringly. “1 have lived

delusive dreamy but now I am undone 1 ” “What’s
the matter ?" enquired the sister, making a curl-paper
out of a produce-report slip. “ My Claudio is fake to

It was in a Redfern tramcar, the other day. A
clergyman, of good standing in this city, accurately
got up in shiny broadcloth, was there. At one of the
street corners a poor woman with her child got in and
sat opposite to him. On the fares being co'leoted,
finding she had to pay for her child, and having, evi-
dently, only « threepenny.bit, she asked the minister
of Christ, who had a number of trara-tiokets ia his
hand, to sell her one. Of course, ho refused the money,
gave her the (ram-ticket, and reverently quoting the
Master’s statement, that “giving to the poor was lend-
lug to tho Lord,” slipped a few shillings into her band,
and modestly “shutting ctf ” her gratitude for an act
which was only his simple duty, got out at tho terminus
and went on his way rejoicing I Of course he did
nothing of the sort Ho last took that threepence
from her, and banded her over a (icktt and a penny
change. It’s all very well to pieach cb> ri y from the
pulpit when the plate Is going toand, but when it
comes to “ parting ” personally to the poor, then the
poor become a nuisance. We think ihut nice, clean,
shiny-hatted clergymen should be protected from the
importunities of paupers. Paupers are so dirty and
ill-dressed.
We have received a sheet of crumpled foolscap,
on whioh is written a poem called “ The Ocean of Life ’’
We may truthfully say that the one supreme and
abiding joy we have in our otherwise gloomy existence
is found in reading poems of this kind ; and we have
it most of the time, for their name is legion. After
struggling through reams of rubbish, wo come across
these gems, and then lie back and let ourselves be
lulled to slumber by their peaceful unmeaningness, or
curled up into convulsions by their cavernous mystery.
There ate two trifling drawbacks, however, to the
Epicurean ocstaoy wo experience In wading through
them, which are that writers of verse after this school
never seem to be able to either spell or write. The
present poet is no exception. He evidently spells by
ear, and has a bad ear for sound, and writes with a fish-
bone or tbe claw of a lobster. He has nothing much to
tell us about the ocean in the first verse, except that it
“moans’’—and we don’t wonder it does, considering how
many moon-calves write about it—and is a pretty
handy rhyme for “ commotion.” But, lower down, he
swells out into the following magnificent mouth-organ
burst of melody. Listen. The Ocean—
“ Unceasingly sings its sad, sad psalm.
Or bounding, crashing, in hellish roar.
Hard struggles the mariner with brain and arm
To reach the shore."
This is where the mystery begins; and now we are
about to convulse. If the ocean “ unceasingly" sings
its whatever-you.call.it, how in thunder can it find time
for “ crashing in hellish roar P” And if the mariner
did net struggle with “ brain and arm” what would he
struggle with ? His ears and toenails ? But we don’t
care, anyhow. A naw patent poet-poison has been laid
round the rooks in the Domain, where the sons of song
usually sleep, by a benefactor of the human race, who

In February, 1880, two lads named William
Punch and William Garble, ware sentenced to death by
the late Judge Barry for rape on ono Susan Hannah
Thompson. The sentences were subeequented com-
muted to “10 years’ stretch," but it is probable that
they will bo now further reduced, for Susan, who has
since been married, now confesses that the young men
were not guilty of the offence imputed to them. Now
had the lads been hanged. Miss Thompson would have
sat down in a nice cool place no doubt, and had a good
cry over the sad fate of her two dishonoured Bills.

Family jars. Mrs. John Tankard, of the cele-

smilingly observed he couldn’t sup-porter because he

cimpensated him for being in such »n unenviable posi-

Respecting the action —or rather inaction—of
the steamtug Little Nell on the occasion of the New

(hewing that he had asked the department if the tug
could go outside upon emergency to assist distressed
vessels, and had been advised that “ great care would
have to be exercised,’’ and that “the department would
not be responsible in case of accident,” The main
excuse, however, why rod tapeism wasn’t thrown over-
board, was that the fires were out and boilers empty,
and that stea n could not be got up in time. Tha evi-
dence of Croat damages that defence.
Most people imagine that stale bread is a very
digestible thing, and that new broad, soft cake, and
such things are extremely hard to digest. But there
is a little confusion here. The fact is, stale bread is no
easier of digestion than new : that it is more easily
digested by most people is entirely owing to their
having, becanse it was hard, chewed it well. It is not
the newness or oldness, it is the mastication that
makes all the difference. If people who debar them-
selves from many nice things, under the delusion that
they cannot digest them, were to chew them properly,
they could have lots more enjoyment and just as good
health. It is rapid eating, witn insufficient mastication
that really cause the dyspeptic's trouble; not tho
food.

Some facts concerning our semi-inspired Educa-
tion ActAt the recent junior public examinations
connected with our University, only 49 Public School
pupils managed to pass a very simple examination ; and
out of this noble array no less than 32 were “plucked”
for the;r inability to master their own—tho English—
language. Our private schools, however, sent up no
less than 116 prize-takers, with only 32 failure* in Eng-
lish ; tho Roman Catholic “ stonewsllers ” scored 41
wins, and only 19 of these were tripped by their native
tongue; whilst Bananaland, with about one quarter
of the population of N.S. W., actually introduced tho
Senate to 32 successful competitors, and no less than 30
of those took first honours ia English. “ These be
facts,” and clearly prove there is something decidedly
rotten, either with our much-vaunted Act, or tho
sipient rulers in whoso hands it has hitherto keen en-
trusted.
Louis Ehronfried is a Grahamstown (N.Z.)
brewer. He engaged a new foreman, the other day, ana
(oly man Ij to try him, gave out that he was going to
Auckland by steamer. He went as far as Tararu, then

steamer, and tock a fancy to visit Ehrenfried’s pretty
wife, Elizabeth. Louis found all right at the brewery,
and started for home, nearing which he heard shrieks.
His next motions were chiefly remarkable for activity,
a big stick, and the forcible ejectment from hie house of
W.W.G , who now, by the way, stands committed for
trial for attempted rape. Louis says his wife was re-
sisting and screaming all her might; so does his man-
ager, W. 8. Styak. W.W.G. rsservsa his defence, and
has had two witnesses, B. Davis and M. Collins, bound
over to appear to give evidence at the Supreme Court.
Bail of £300 and two snrities of £150 each allowed.
Armand and Leon Peltzer have at last been
judicially disposed of in Belgium, Their trial was
apparently interminable. They stood charged with the
murder of M. Bernays, a noted Antwerp lawyer, but
the case seemed shrouded in mystery. It was stated at
one period of the investigations that Madame Bernays,
the widow of the murdered man, was gravely com-
promised by portions of the evidence, and the full text
of the public court proceedings will be awaited with
interest. .In the preliminary investigations, 373 prin-
cipal witnesses were examined, besides a vast number
of persons being questioned on minor points. Of tha
principal witnesses, 212 belonged to Antwerp, Brussels,
or other Belgian cities, 19 to Paris, 15 came from Ham-
burg, 11 from Bremen, 9 from Aix-la-Chapelle, 4 from
London, 8 from New York, U.U., and the rest from
other European towns and villages. Those questioned
on minor points included 410 Paris barbers, and all the
makers of firearms in Brussels, Antwerp, and Liege.
The evidence in the Auckland (N.Z.) murder
sensation is pnrely circumstantial. It was at first
given out that Hamilton, tho dead man, fell while
drank and hit his bead against the post of a bed. It ia
pretty clearly established that Priestly had an improper
intimacy with Mrs. Hamilton, who is described as a
hard-featured, unprepossessing woman of 35 years, tall
and spare in form. Priestly Is 25 years of age, ellghtly
built, of taking exterior, and the last person one would
dream of accusing of murder. Mr. Hamilton was a tall,
massively-built, powerful man, and It is considered
strange that his death should have been encompassed
by Priestly by personal violence. The most probable
theory in favour ia that no murder was planned, that
Hamilton coming home unexpectedly from a Lodge
meeting found Priestly in hia house, and that a struggle
ensued, during which Mrs. H. went to the assistance of
her paramour with an axe and sent her old man to
glory. Priestly had bought strychnine on one cr two
oooasions, bat had not used it.
Two women, Mrs. Taylor and Mrs. Monichon,
stand charged at Melbourne with conspiring to procure
abortion. The first-named is already committed on a
charge of manslaughter arising from alleged similar
malpractice. Sue is credited by popular rumour with
having made a regular trade with unfortunates. The
preseu* prosecutor is Mr. James Proet, teaeher of the
Qsmbrook state school, whose family of two girls
and a boy reside ia Grattan-itreor, Prahran, a suburb
of M-l bourne. The youngest daugutar, Uelestine, ia
aged 16 years. She became acquainted with a medical
stndent, who, she alleges, drugged and then seduced
her. Celestine appealed to Mre. Monichon for aid, and
Mrs. M. recommended Mrs Taylor. The father just
heard of the proceedings in the nick of time, rushed to
Mrs. Taylor’s house, burst ia the bedroom door, and
dragged out Celestine while she was actually under tha
woman’s manipulation. His object, he says, in prose-
cuting is principally to find out tho seducer, who gave
a false name and is “lying low.”
Crushed again! Only the other day it was
found that, at Maryborough (Q ), a follow named Lowry,
who was very holy indeed, had been stealing no end of
things from shops. He was “ sent up " for a ceuple of
years. And bow the pious aeoretary of the local Hospital,
who bears what, under the present cironmitauces, is
singularly inappropriate, the “ Monniker ” of Allbon,
and who, in the words cf the local editor, “has
for a considerable period bean a respected and promi-
nant member of several religious and social bodies in
tais community,” has been embezzling money from the
poor. How ie it that the Evil One wen't let alone good
aid virtuous men—men who wear blaok-cloth suits and
smiles like benedictions, and carry prayer-books and
testaments on Sunday f Old Nick is carrying the war
into the enemy’s camp. There mmit have been another
bvttle between the fallen angels and tho Heavenly
torcos, and the devil has the best ef it this time. We
don’t see anything about it in the Hown. The sooun-
d'els—the men who will all go to Hell because they visit
art galleries on Sunday, and want to see mote trams
ran on tho Sawbath—manage to keep out of gaol. True
piety is getting more and more leg-irons on it.

We think it ought to be stated, in the inheres
of the spread of the Gospel, that a clergyma
at a recent wreck was in tho life.boat before s
was launched. Owing to the high seas, it was wi
great difficulty that the only ladies on board oeuld
taken by tho boat from the vessel.
It was on the New England wreck, and the bi
lows were a bit angry. The epok ran up to one of t
clergymen, weeping. “ We’ll be lost,” he said, “ we’
be lost now. We must trust in Him.” “What
cried the parson, in deep anguish, “ trust in Him I A'

On Sunday week, Mrs. Watson again gained th
attention of a full house by hoe lecture on “ Divinity
Mm,” in the Academy of Music. Hero are two
three of her thoughts“ The doctrine of total depravil
is the quintessence of blasphemy. We are too muo
in the habit of believing in goodness afar oft, and ove
look that which is within ns. God never sent into th;
world a human being, without sending a portion of him
self. The world could do better without religion tha
without morality.” Mrs. Watson always closes poet
cilly, with pieces excellently recited, which she state
are original and impromptu.

after all not an infidel. Henry used to be a Congrega
tioualist 1 Now he isn’t a Congregationalist
He is now a Free J.anco with rather a peculia
mixture of beliefs. He does not believe in origina
sin, nor in hell, nor in the atonement, but h
does in a personal God and in ihe divinity of Christ. 1
man who once begins to move in this way never stops
and if Mr. Beecher lives long enough he will certain!
desert the personal God and the divinity of Christ as h'
has the others. There is no logical half-way hous
between accepting the whole of the Bible dogmas ant
accepting none of them. It is only a questien of time

Here’s the sort of item we like. “A Gratefu
Man” writes us with respfftt to our lines last week
apropos of Dr. Celletti’s projected departure (with
puree of sovereigas) to Europe. We hinted that the
Rev. Doctor might, just by way of novelty, share some
of the sovereigns with the poor ho leaves behind him
“ A Grateful Man" feels called upon to bear testimony
to the fact that in his hour of need four priests, among
whom was Dr. Collitti, helped him to maintain his
largo family till things took a turn; also, he believes
that his experience has been that of hundreds. We
don’t doubt it. We believe there is hardly a priest or
parson in tho colony who hasn’t given away a good deal
in charity. And we won’t even haggle over the fact
that, as priests and parsons are not producers, it must
always be other people’s labour which provides the
money they distribute. But here’s the pinch. How on
earth is ono to reconcile tho fact of a man having sworn
a vow of poverty with the spectacle of his deparrure
for a holiday with a first-class ticket and a purse of
sovereigns ?
The parishioners of St. Judo’s, Liverpool, are
determined to fight out the good cause in thtir shirt
sleevei if necessary. What they are backing about
just now, is the profanation of the services by—first,
monkish cassocks; second, a surplioed choir; third,
processions; fourth, preaching in the surplice; fifth,
intoning the prayers; sixth, early morning (fasting)
celebration of the Lord’s Supper; seventh, naming tho
Lord’s table the “altar” and bowing to it; eighth, a
cross and fiower vases on the Lord’s table; ninth,
teaching the Real Presence and baptismal regeneration;
tenth, turning to the east and bowing. On Sunday
morning tho Protestant party gave vent in the church
to disagreeable sounds, and when the incumbent and
tho choristers proceeded down the aisle, an attempt
was made to stop them. A disgraceful struggle was
the consequence, and Mr. Fitzroy and the choristers
took oil their surplices on the spot. Several blows
ware made at the incumbent, who warded them eff as
well as he could. The police appeared on the scene
and, wo presume, the sacred service closed with the
usual benediction.

Ours is a religions paper. Wo wonder whether Dean
Cowper has ever road the phrase “Where two or three

sary for effectual prayer, then the time is rapidly
approaching when the Almighty will withdraw

In to oae of the pseude-ouros performed at
Lourdes, it quotes the article of a Jesuit in the Nine-
teenth Century, to the following effect“ It is not
a question in this case of any nervous affection j it is
on the material injury that we must coucentrate oar
attention ; whatever its nature, cancerous or scrofulous
—probably the latter—her care, like all oases of affec-
tions resulting from natural dispositions, required a
certain period of time. The instantaneous cicatriza-
tion of the wound, or, rather, the sudden renewal of all
the elements constituting the derma and epidermis,
could not belong to the domain of nature’s forces." Oh !
Perhaps your reverence will be good enough to tell up
why it couldn't. We have as ranch reason to disbelieve
that it was the result of God’s contradiction of his own
laws, as you to disbelieve that it was a perfectly
natural, though extraordinary, occurrence. Anyhow,
we have a much higher opinion of the Almighty than
to think Ho has nothing else to do but oome down from
heaven, every week or two, to cure skin-diseases. Whar.
wo would most particularly like to know is. who is
running the miracle show, and what commission they

Rev. Charles Fraser, of St. Andrew’s Presby-
terian Church, Christchurch (N. Z.), has been suspended
by the Presbytery, for alleged Don Jaanistio practice*.
Charley wouldn’t give up the keys of his sanctuary,
however, but smuggled in a congregation by side doors,
and had the service in full swing before he opened the
front door to let in the crowd and the parson appointed
to be his substitute. The latter formally protested
agaiust Fraser’s preaching, but Charles didn’t Kind
that. He now asks to bo tried by the General Assembly
of the Free Churoh, and wants to pick out the com-
mittee who shall take evidence. Ho was also managing
trustee of the Scotch cemetery at Addington. This
site was conveyed to trustees under a deed which
failed to specify the purposes for which it was reserved,
and, according to accounts, Fraser sold a portion of
this on his own authority. Thera is a deficiency of
£995 in the cemetery funds, and ihe Rev. Charles
claims that he alone is responsible for the income and
outlay, but he doesn’t say to whom ho is respom-ible
At latest, the sexton was, in accordance with instruc-
tion* from a majority of the Trust, paying in all re-
osipts to a well-known business man in Christchurch,
the first week’s income being £17. On this, says
Christchurch Society, 11 what a jolly fine income some
gay old party has been deriving from the cemetery for
some years past.”
The Mormons sent two missionaries to the
Maoris lately. These elders started their crusade at
Papawai, wh«re they fell into the hands of a foxy old
chief called Manihua, who c-mbred them on suit in the
first hand. They commenced their discourse with the
usual “guyver" about the angel Moroni—a short-
necked, curly-toothed Irishman, who was oelestialised
for shooting a landlord from behind a hedge a longtime
ago, and who subsequently, like a good many more of
his countrymen, tried to oonceal his nationality by
Italianizing his name. Moroney—wo are not going to
be accomplices in this titular traxd—according to the
elders, descended from Heaven, a id gave Joe tmith
two tables of gold, whereon were ius< rihed all the laws
Mormon religion Here Manihua interrupted
the discourse by asking if those tables were still to the
fore. The missionaries replied that they were not—
Moroney had taken thorn back to Heaven. The dis-
trust in Mormon commercial morality which this action
*n? p Hed was very satirically commented upon by the
Maori chief, who afterwards bowled over the mission-
aries in several Scriptural quotations. Driven to
desperation, one of thorn at last asserted that he pos-
•hessed miraculous powers, to which Manihua replied :
jALIf you exercise these powers, I will gat\er 20,000 of
vuy people together; and if you cm show that you have
them, we will believe your daotrme and join your
church, but we will r .tay where we are until then.’*
The Maoris are still where they were. Manihua, how-
ever, found reason to modify his incredulity when he
saw the elders worrying roast pig. But the religion of
Joe Smith is a crushed concern as far as the Maori j go
The D.T. missed a good chance when Pastor
Alien was secured by the Witness as a humo-ons
writer. Daniel is mostly at home ou Hell. Speaking
first of the glowing side of the picture, he obierves :—
“ What a glorious transition to be instantly removed
from husband, wife, brother, sister, and children, to
stand in the full blaze of the glory emanating from the
Throne." And then he burns blue fire : “How horrible
must be the surprise when the sinners are launched
from the scenes of worldly pleasures, sins, delights,
relations, and early associations, into the smoke of their
torments. . . Acoidonfes did wesay ? Yes; but we only
use this word as belonging to, and used by man—not as
belonging to and used by Jehovah. Accidents breaks
'sic) men from their purposes and designs, and revolu-
tionises all their pursuits." And then the dear old
Gospel-grinder remarks consolingly : " If the stone falls
on me and kills me, or the axe takes off my head (the
papists’ axe, of course), or the tram crushes me to
death—these are but the designed means planned by my
Loard to remove my soul from earth to the heavens cf
His own glory,*' Woll, we would like here to announce
that, if Pastor Allen for certain is booked for glory,
anybody can have our ticket; we simply don’t want
glory. Daniel winds up with another strange query :
“ If the exit from earth to heaven of the Loard’s people
ware left to our determination, when would the Loard’s
people be glorified ?’’ Simply never, Pastor. And
we’ll wager, Daniel, that, as long as the tnopuses come
in, you yourself won’t be in a hurry to be glorified.
You’ve hit it, Daniel, right on the head. It has all
along been a mystery to us why the people so certain of
Paradise hang on so tenaciously to this world.
One of the most tremendous and scathing
wipinga-down we ever remember to have read adminis-
tered in a newspaper by one man to another, has just
been dealt out by “ Will Honeycomb," of the Dnnno
Dispatch, to the Rev. Mr, Holland, an Orange cloi>y-
m°n of that town. Mr. Holland had written to oensuie
“Will Honeycomb” for having referred to the Orange
Society as “ an organisation which endeavours to prove
the value of Christianity by hating their neighbours
for the love of God." To this description the Rev Mr
Holland takes exception, as “ a slander so foul and
false that I can hardly find words sufficiently fxpres-
sive to indicate my abhorrence of the charge;" and when
the editor justifies his position bv a crushing quota-
tion descriptive of Orangei.sm from the Cyeloioelia of
E. and W". Chambers (two Presbyterians), and by other
historical epitomes, Mr. Holland imprudently refuses to
permit any weight to attach to these testimonials, and
claims that the Society be judged by it* professions, as
expressed in its published rules. It would be a grand
thing for humbug* of all kinds, if people would only
consent to judge them according to their professions
The greatest hypocrite would then ba entitled to pass
ftfer the most virtuous mao. Of coarse, a practised
writer, like” Will Honeycomb,’’.makes short work with
nonsensical contention of that kind. He peremptorily

position. Oh. drop it. you blockheads. P
Mrs. Watson s last Sunday evening in Svdnev
was devoted to answering questions, instead of a
lecture. I want to say right here that I can’t
onswer all sorts of questions,*' said the American lady •
nevertheless, when the papers were opened, all sorts of
questions were there One person a,bed whether the
opening of the Art Gallery oa Sundays was good ?
another, should barmaids be suppressed? Some
wrote essays of two sheets of notepaper, and then
forgot to asb anything at the end. A (probably
married) man asked whether, if he married a shrew
here, he’d be able to get clear of her in the sweet
futurity P while a member of the Y.M.C A. propounded
the vague conundrum, “Who is on the Lord’s side?’*
adding, “Who art thou that repliest against God ?’■
This conundrum brought forth a prompt and very
caustic reply, “ What Lord’s side ? There have been
many Lords, and each believer thinks his own Lord
the true one We are, I trust, not on the side of the
Lord pictured by Moses and the ancients, who was an
infamous and cruel being, created onl? in their own
on ie of the Lord Jesus, but not
as the Young Men's Christian Association of this city
is, who would hate it that He could utter the sentence,
* He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved •
but he that believeth not shall be damned ’—as if bel
lief were a matter of choice!” “The employment of
either bar-girls or bar-men is a curse when they are
the means by which ono man preys on the weakness,
and profits by the ruin of his fellow ” “ To
what extent have we a right to judge ethers ?”
“ Only to that extent that we understand the
intricate causes that led to the wrongdoing
None knows the temptations that beset ths
soul of his brother. Our young larribin, born
and bred in iniquity, is not re«poasible for all he
does. Upon those st all rest the judgment who, seeing
his condition, do nought to better it" Then came:
“ In the good time coming, when woman shall be equal
a l enter bis sphere, if the wife become
Minister for Lauds, who should mind the baby?”
Mrs. Waison took this seriously, on the principle in-
volved “If the mother would make a better political
Minister than the father would—and it would be so in
many eases then, in heaven's name, let the father
mind the bn by, and the woman do lhat for which she
is fitted. Victoria is none the less true as a woman and
a mother because she is a queen ; and those who bow
to her cannot protest, against women entering public
spheres. Don’t be afraid that woman will get out ©f
her sphere ; she cannot—Nature will ta>o care of that.
There is no fei r of woman doing that which she cannot
do; but what she can do, and do well, that thing she
has a right to do." The individual who was anxious
about a chance of “shunting” his diavreeab’e wife in
the happy land, far, far away, was told that aseparation
was not only possible, but that probably both parties
would gravitate to mates beUer suited to them. Of
course, time only permi Med the answering of some of
the questions ; but the impromptu answers were
rapidly given in good, and often exceedingly pungent,
diction, while the jieroration was most eloquently de-
livered,

At the settling over Tattersall’s meeting, Mr.
Deery, the well-known bookmaker, announced his
intention of presenting a 100-gninea Cup for next year.
Ned Jones’s generosity has put the talent on their
mottle.
Mr. George, the English champion amateur
runner, is a large, deep-chested, muscular man.
Myers, his American rival, is, on tho contrary, a slim
light-weight, who runs rather by nervous than muscu-
lar power. Hence, for anything over half a mile George
is Myers’ master.
“ Got ’em again.” The George Washington
who docs the Em's racy tips confidently speaks of about
a dozen four-legged veterans, including Balmoral, Brian
Bom, Cuunamulla, and Masquerade, ns likely starters
for a “ Maiden ” Plate. This came out on Monday
morning, and yet ’Oly ’ Arry says the Licensing " Hact”
works well on Sundays.
At a recent bat-and-ball banquet the Hon. Ivo
Bligh declared his team and himself had travelled
12 000 miles to take the revered ashes of that English
cricket which had been cremated at the Oval home to
their native land once more. And when the big battle
was over Murdoch thoughtfully observed, "Ivo—Iv’orly
to add that you’ve simply waxed up the urn a little
tighter, kou haven’t yet tied a knot in tho tail of the
bounding kangaroo.”
One of the ‘‘wealthier lower orders” on the
railway lino has been discovered in the contemptible
business of shooting carrier pigeons while on their
flight to Sydney. ’Tis said an offer of £100 wa« made
to stifle a proseoution. M to than a dozen valuable
carriers have bean lost by this kind of thing. In a
match flown afew days ago, only one bird out of three
turned up, and the one which did arrive had its legs
broken by shot. We’d juat like the namo of this re-
nowned sportsman.
N.S.W. Rowing Association Committee meet-
Ing, Exchange Hotel, Monday last. It wa* resolved
I. That a paid secretary bo appointed. 2. That Mr
H. Coles be asked to engage tho secretary. 3 That
the oommittee appoint one of its number to direct the
affairs of the Association. (Mr. H. Coles, by the una-
nimous wish of his fellow-committeemen, consented
to act in an honorary capacity.) 4, That Messrs. Cope,
Xiockyer, and Oatley select tho eight oarsmen to repre-
sent this colony in tho forthcoming intercolonial race.
5. That the next Krug race be rowed on the third
Saturday in June.
Factions at Tamworth over Nathan Cohen’s
cup, offered to an athletic club in West Tamworth.
Nathan proffered it to the East Tamworth Athletio
Club first. A tobacconist exhibited it in his window,
against the wishes of the oommittee, and wouldn’t give
it up when asked for it, being afraid that it might
shortly adorn the window of a rival. Committee got
grumpy; refused cup ; substituted prize of £5 instead:
Cohen waltzed over with it to the West Tamworth men,
and everybody who knew a boy connected with any of
the local papers rushed into print. There may be
bleeding over this cupping yet.
The most recent revelations in connection with
the George-Myers matches show the whole thing to be,
from an American point of view, merely an affair gob
up for money-making purposes, with, of course, the
usual addition of a further humiliation of England.
England, personified by George, however, declined to
be humiliated ; and a remarkable trial run by the
Englishman at three-quarters of a mile frightened
Myers and his backers to the extent of causing the
American representative to refuse to run on tho ploa of
illness. A new match is said to have been made, but
by the postponement the Yankees have saved their
‘bets.
Mr. Lawcs, defendant in the great English
islander case, Belt (the sculptor) v, Lawes, was one of
the most prominent athletes of bygone years. As a
boy, he stroked Eton at Henley. As an undergraduate
he stroked the •• ’Varsity” at Putney in ’05, and Third
-trinity at Henley Kegatta in the same year, when that
club won the Ladies’ Plate. He won the Diamond
Sculls at Hsnley in 1863, and the Wingfield (or Ama-
teur) Champion Houlls in 1865. He won the Inter-
University Mil.) Eaca in 1864, the first year in which
the Universities had athletic sports between themselves
Ho also wm tho Champion Mile Cup at Lillie Bridge in

amateur athletes.

Hanlan is having a new boat built of the follow-
ing specifications:— Spanish cedar, 31(t. 6in. long, llin.
wide, and to weigh when finished 281b , 1 owlooks in-
cluded ; fitted with three watertight compartments,
the bulkheads being at either end of the cock-pit, so
that in case the boat should ship a sea the water would
remain in the cockpit, the strongest psrt of the boat,
as well as being the most convenient place in the boat
for weight-carrying. The boat is to be fitted with a
patent “fin” similar to the centreboard of a sailing
vessel. It is of steel, one thirty-aeocnd of an inch in
thickness, 12in. in length, and 3in. deep. It is placed
about four feet from the sternpost, in a watertight
brass well, and is fitted with notches, and can bo
lowered and raised at will, according to the state of the
weather. This boat, when finished, will be the first
ever built in America fitted with a “fla.” On 17th

THE SALVATION HARMY.
It was very hot. The sun sank as it werejhiss-
ing into the ocean, leaving a heat-cloud which parched
and baked the city. Being Sunday evening, the hotels
were supposed to be closed, and all down George-street
rows of men stood panting against pub.-posts, feebly
wrestling with the myriads of flies which buzzed is
unclean clouds about their greasy hats, or settled in
layers upon tho backs of their frowsy coats. Dogs lay
exhausted with their tongues twined round lamp-posts;
and the street-corner hoodlums were almost too much
enervated either to “jolly " small men with big prayer-
books, or to pull smoko and curses into the faces of
pissing ladies. Cabmen drooped upon their perches
like unwatered tulips, and little tradesmen sat costless
in their doorways, through which the enquiring
stranger could see mounds of fostering oranges and
boxes of apricots in a condition of coagulation. Wide
open were all the church doors, and tho lamps in the
lobbies burned dim and ghastly; while parsons who
had arrived to officiate might have been seen lingering
on the steps outside, and mopping, with miniature
tent-flies, the concentrated essence of muffin which tho
extreme heat had caused to well out upon their holy
foreheads.

Castlereagh-street had, so to speak, its tonrue
out. In that section south of King-street, the panting
was so great in every squalid house that, walking in
the middle of the street, it seemed as though you
could hear the beating of the city’s heart. Every
window was propped up with articles which varied
from a Bum reporter's shoe to a gingerbeer-bottlo, and
the natives of both sexes swarmed bare-footed upon the
pavement: many of the ladies, it may be said, sacrificing'
to Sol to an extent which caused their presence to prove
embarrassing to the gaze of the Young Man Christian
as he flttted on his way to the vespernal wresrle. On
this dreadful night we had been lured from our lair by
an advertisement. “The Salvation Army" nad an-
nonnoed.n the Herald that they would have a service
at the Protestant Hall at seven o’clock. And so.
thither* U3a^ a^a,r t resolved to wend our way
* • •
The Protestant Hall, as every religiously-dis-
posed person should know, is situated in Castlereagh-
street, very near tho Gaiety Theatre. It has a square
interior of uninviting apptarance. and is pervaded by
an odour of sanctity and Pastor Allen. As wo entered
but two gas-lamps were dimly burning, and about v
hundred people were scattered about the lower part of
the house, the only oacupants of the gallery being two
small boys who wore diverting their thoughts from
earthly matters by cracking nuts with a noise that
made the place sound like a shooting-gallery. Upon
the platform were two persons—Captain Sutherland and
his Lieutenant. Tho former appeared to be deenlv
engaged in prayer; the latter to ba occupied in the more
worldly cmjjK.j,imuit. ot •• cuuuMng tuo auu»o •* Tnere
was a piano there with a gr«eu baize cover, and cm the
top of it a key bugle, and on either side of the stojre was
a draw-ourtuin strongly suggestive of a ventriiioquial
entertainment. Tho Captain was seated at a t *.ile in
the centre, and wore a blue tunic with three stripes
and a pair of duck pants which should get his laundress
three months Facially this gallant; officer not
remarkable What von can see of hi 8 counter anoo d

equally of the waiter and the foreman; but though he
possessed in an eminent degree the unotuousness .of the
former, h« lacked to a certain extent the bellicose (aspect
of tho lattor.
• • •
The Lieutenant impressed us as being an apostle
who, for conscientious reasons, had forsworn the uco
of yellow soap and water in his early youth. He is the
kind of man—if we may judge by his appearance—who
would carry desolation into a boarding-house. His eye is

of the lower jaw which is fatal to food in all its phases.
s * )0rfc "bite trousers like his superior officer;
and both he and the Captain exercised a wise discretion
m not showing any linen. While mentally noting these
things, the audience increased rapidly The “nigger ’’
element was very prominent. We noticed na less than
three black barbers and a coloured cook iu hhe third
row. Curiously enough, although the “ Army ’’
avowedly appeals to tho larrikin, comparatively few of
that class was present. It is true that in certain
corners and near the doors groups of “ leary ’’.looking
joung men chewed tobacco, ana at times interjected
irreverent remarks ; but the meeting was chiefly com-
posed of persons of the lower middle class, who had
been attracted there by curiosity. There were several
men, it is true, who were fuller of beer than piety • and
one of these, turning to his companions, said, ’in a
voice that was audible throughout the hall, “ Oh jam
this : let’s go out and have a drink before tho fun com.
mences,” a sentiment which was received with much,
merriment by a lady in the front row of the gallery
who was in a great condition of bosom and bugles.
• • •
At about five minutes past seven, Mrs. Suther-
land, accompanied by two plate-bumpers, came on the
stage from tho O P. side. We don’t know who the two
persons were that Mrs. S. brought with her, but their
appearance was such as to strike alarm, if not affright
m tho human heart. One had a light coat and black
pants, and sported a pair of bluchers, beside which Dr.
Bowie Wilson’s high-lows would appear but glass
slippers. His face was a study—its expression being
half pious, half ferocious, and he looked as if he had
had his hair last cut with a hatchet. His fellow-
conspirator resembled a story-book giant who
had turned undertaker — and provided his own
corpses. Mrs. Captain Sutherland is a lady in-
side a straight black skirt and a straight black
jacket. Though, perhaps, it is nngallant to say so, her
appearance is suggestive of something heavy—say a
factory chimney or a church—having fallen on her some
years ago, and of her having just been dragged out
from beneath the debris in a conoition of extreme piety
but excessive flatness. Mrs. Kutherland wearsalonnat
(black) of the coal-souttio order of architecture, and,
with her very tnin face, leads the outside spectator tu
the unalterable conclusion that the gallant Captain has
acquired the habit of starting on tho steak and onions of
a morn while the good lady is engaged in washing the
kids. On her I«ft breast was a silver (or tin) budge like
that of a New York policeman, and she was armed with
a very huge and limp diblu. Altogether, wo should
consider it unsafe to allow our good lady to gaze upon
Mrs. 8.—under certain interesting domestic ciroum-
stances.
• • •
Mra. Sutherland commenoed the proceedings by
“ giving ont ” what she termed “ 'im ten.’* “ ’Im ten,’’
which avowedly by General Booth, is, on the whole
a lyrio of a feeble nature, its burden being—
“ .^ ou g0 * wil1 * ou go * win you go, will yon go.
Will you go to tho Eden above p”
When Mrs. 8. had read the verse, the Captain rushed
out in front of the table, and, working bis arms up and
down, violenily, began to lead the singing. 'Ihsre was
no music. This was a blow to us. We had Roped to see
Mrs. 8. perform on the concertina, and the lieutenant
on the key bugle, but were doomed to disappointment.
There was not even a Jew’s-harp in the show. Scattered
amongst the audience were a number of little dog-eared
volumes, which bore the title, “Salvation Soldiers’
Song Book, by W. Booth.** Not being provided, we en-
quired of a Salvationist in our vicinity it we oonld obtain
one. He. said wa could—wo brightened at this—in
Pitt-street far tuppence—when we became depressed.
The Captain and his quartette had all the singing to
themselves tor a while, but subsequently a number of
the audience joined in. Then, as tne tune did net oon.
tain melody of a pronounced nature, a great many
apilted into other airs they knew better—such as ** Over
There,” " Grandfather’s Clock,” " Yon can’t get ’em,”
andother well-known melodies, and so it oame to pass
that there was a good deal more holloaing than har-
mony, The Liontonant was very energetic. Ho howled
himself into a profuse perspiration immediately—a
state of allairs which brought into unpleasant pro-
minence at frequent intervals, a duster of a weird and
shroud-like aspect.
• • •
When the singing was over—a shrill young
woman, whose " will yon go ” was four bars late, creat-
ing some laughter—Mrs. S. read a portion of the
scriptures in a very thin voice, and then the Captain
delivered an address. “I have been,” said he, “all the
rrAT n : t0 S etl anor h bu t have been hnnsuooessfnl.”
wnat the barmy wanted, it appeared, was money, so as
to buila an orl of their hown. “ Wonst a week,” cried
tne Captain, “ ain't enough for me. I want to pray with
you not one night, but hevery night”—a statement
wnioh was received with semi-suppressed derision by
the vandals near the door. According to the Captain
we were all going to hell, and as he had oome to save
us, he was “onsettled” at not being able to obtain
suitable promises. “Some people," remarked the
Captain, • are a little jealous of us," from which wo
glean that Pastor Allen does not smile upon the move-
ment, or the Canon objects to the barmy poaching on bis
holy preserves. “ The devil," the Cap. considered,
»ni going about seeking ‘who’ ho might devour"
and now was the time to ” got Christ." or " oe damned
forever At this jnnotnre, the “1st and 2nd mur-
derara got up ana loft—their one to ” go oil O P "
being probably ” damned for aver." In a few moments
these appeared "on the llure," each armed with a.
plate, and a collection was proceeded with vigorously—
the Lieutenant from his elevated position keeping an
eagle heye upon the coin, while Mrs. Sutherland on.
gaged in prayer with one ohtok pressed against the
water-bottle.
• • •
The audience having been eased of their small
change, a hymn was snng-everything was sandwiohod
with a clerical supplication of the •• Bob liidley " type
—and Mrs. Sutherland oonmanced to read laud
"expound") the 4th chap, of the First Epistle to the
Corinthians. Hardly, however, had the lady com.
menoed to pipe out the first verse, when some emis-
Banes, either of the devil or a rival clergyman, turned
out the gas lamps in the body of the hall, leaving only
a feeble gleam on the stage. It took some time for a
man with a pole and a taper to remedy this, but when
he had completed his task (and, wa regret to Bay, been
warmly applauded), Mrs. Sutherland pegged away
again. It was a dreary, dreary business. The poor
woman cannot even read with ordinary proficiency
She got bogged at dissyllables, stumbled at trisyllables
and came badly to grief over proper names. And her
running commentary I It was a pitiful Btring of halt-
ing sentences, pregnant with fragments of time-worn
and busted" theories, all mixid together in one
heterogeneous jumble—a sad and sorry exhibition!
But when Mrs. Sutherland had snut up her Bible the

passed without a riot. He then said that they purposed
cleansing the slums of iniquity, and generally scatter-
iug conversion around upon a poor benighted populace
He spoke for twt nty minutes, and there was no coho*
rence in his addres?. But to counterbalance this
disability, there were several bushels of false quantities
Before Bitting—“ setting" he called it-down. the
Lieutenant Bald—” Christ told me all this ” .- a remark
which, for many reasons, was received with marked
incredulity.
• • *
Mrs. Sutherland was the last to speak, and she
gave out a text in the orthodox manner—John “ the
height verse," &o. This was about Lazarus: and men-
tally we welcomed back our old friend with effusion
Now, we thought, we are going to hear something new
about an histone personage who has always interested us
But we wore disappointed. Poor old Laz. was left out In
the cold at a very early stage of the proceedings, and
Mrs. Sutherland regaled ua with an aooount * not with-
out a certain amount of pathos—of how she had lost
her last baby. The commencement of her address was
in these words: —
“ Bethlehem was a very pretty place, a very beautiful
place. There was a 'ouse in Bethlehem, in which
lived a fam ly in heasy oironinstances Jesus
used to go there," etc.
On second thoughts, it would be impossible to prodace
Mrs. Sutherland s utterances in detail. Their varv
simplicity ot diction, in speaking of what people hold
sacred, forbids it. Suffice it to say, however, that durinur
three-quarters of an hour, the poor lady preached t,.
her audience, and, in tho whole of her discourse, not one
-‘1-° wm balanced, nor a dozen consecutive words
correctly spoken. At one portion of her address, she
was saluted by some larrikins outside with cries of
.Dry up, old girl I Give us a rest 1" interspersed
with veutriloqnial imitations of her style of delivery.
took no notice—rambling on apparently unoon-
scions of the interruptions. Once, when we thought it
wa» all over, she commenced again afresh, saviug—
Men and women, in 'ow many ’onses is there a

was back m Bethlehem again, alluding to the rolling
away of the stone by the angels from the sepnloltru
and saying, sharply. “ Why didn't Jesus roll away the
stone himself f — upon which a man who bad been
naramg a big ohild all the evening, growled out, ” Ask
us something easy 1"—shocking ua exceedingly by his
irreverence, 8 ’ 3 “

Looking at Mrs. Sutherland from a oritioal point
of view, she appears to ns to be simply a well-meaning
woman, with a very small mind and a very long tongue
and we opine that she will no more convert people with
her publio oeliverancos than she will convert them with

A party of Bachelors, at Hornsby, gave their

An eminent New York dancing-master speaks
thus of tho way his art is practised among the different
classes of society:—“Tho reverse is nearly dead,
respectable society klliel it; they never danced it
properly, but is a style that offended good taste. Many
would do tho reverse motion, but yet, to make it easier,
because not sufficiently skilful to do it properly, they
would also go the opposite way round the room, and of
course bumped against everyone they mot. Tho reverse
can only be properly done by circling the room in tbe
same direction as the majority are going, and to do this
requires careful tuition and much practice and skill.
Tnose who feel they cannot do it shonld be content with
tbe simple old plan. Nothing ean excuse going the
wrong way round the room, which is pure rudeness to
other dancers.*’ Again, said ho, “ many persons who
have picked up the steps correctly enough are peculiarly
awkward ia their carriage. They bend aa if they had
cramp, whereas ease of deportment and absence of any
apparent exertion are indispensable to a graceful
terpsioborcan. I have seen young men place their
partner’s right band behind their hips—no lady allows
it, unless she is deficient in dalioaoy, or, in some oases,
too shv to raise oljeo'icns, although she dislikes it. A
good dancer will always look where he or she is going,
but frequently both are in fault. I have seen both
ladies and gentlemen hanging their heads over one
another’s shoulders : she limp, with her cheek on his
coat flap, sometimes even her eyes shut; and he
craning past her ear as if endeavouring to count the
buttons down her back, just in the attitude of a goat
bucking at a gate. These gaucheries would bring nay
dancing into disrej-u’e. Bad taste, yon say ? Yes,
but it is done everywhere, more or less. Indeed,”
continued tbe professor, “it is a fact that the most
immoral methods of dancing are practised in the
highest and most aristocratic circles, while tbe plain
people dance properly and decorously. We insist that
when a couple are dancing they should see the floor
between them, and such a fashion as for a lady to
rest her head on her partner’s shoulders, or for a
gentleman to hug bis partner in the waltz, is dis-
countenanced entirely. There should be no more
contact of person ia dancing than when a lady takes
a gentlemen’s arm in the street. A lady who dances
well and gracefully, maintains her independence of
motion and a perfect balance. The moment she be-
comes a clinging vino, and allows her head to rest on
a man’s shoulder and his arm to embrace instead of
support her, she shows not only a shocking lack of
refinement, but of good dancing and impedes her
partner’s movements as well as her own. The
sandwioh-Iike cohesion seen, not only at public
bill, but at private gatherings, is inelegant, immodest,
and unnecessary. Lovers often bring dancing into
ridicule bv their spooning manner. A couple of perfect
dancers disport themselves like a lady and gentleman ;
no grabbing, hugging, pulling and hauling; they will
stand erect at such a distance as I have stated, and take
every step and motion in exact time and harmony, cir-
cling, reversing, and gliding with a rhythm and poetry
of motion, without excitement or an appearanoe of hard
work. But, to pat the whole matter in a nutshell, the
vulgar and vicious waltz vulgarly and viciously; the
innocent and refined, in a refined and innocent manner."

the Oddfellows'Hall, Brisbane-stroet, on Friday. The
hall was qxite full, many ladies being present, and some
members appeared in fall Highland costume. The first
item was a Highland reel by some dozen couples, to the
music of two bagpipes. Owing to the limited size of
the hall these nseful instruments were, it seemed to na,
hoard to too much advantage. However, it was very
inspiriting. Other dances, songs, Ac , followed, and
the “woe drap whusky" was not forgotten for those who

well attended. Flagship, that now historic steamer, be-
loved of J. D., C.M.G , the Ooonaubnra. Great interest
was taken in most of tho races, notwithstanding the
chief part of them was ont of sight. The judge’s wife
and daughters, as usual, looked blooming. Miss
Davenport and Mr. Sheridan, the tragedian, were there
—the ladv in a black silk with bead trimming. The
young ladies’ costumes were particularly gay and nice,
especially a blue sateen skirt and white China silk
polonaise; a dork pompadour surmounted by a biau’l-
ful face, was charming; sister ia light-coloured ditt>
looked equally well. A pretty faoe under a large hat
came from Waratah in pompadour rateeu; a flerld-
young lady, in blue and brass buttons, was very
effective. A great drawback was the soaroity of seats,
and the presence of a few Newcastle larrikins, who
commenced dancing Clontarf stylo on the steamer,
ought to have been prevented.

Sir Henry Parkes is about to visit his consti-

learn that “ measles are ostonUhly prevalent" down
Tenterfleld way, “some member of every family ( vide
H.M. Herald) being laid prostrate with tne disease j in
some cases whole families are down with it." Yet we
have not seen anything about the “ finger of Provid-
onoe" in connection with this in the religions papers.
We cannot glean from tho “ Murmurs of the Stream "
whether the ex-Mogul has ever had measles; and, of
course, we wouldn’t like to see a veteran like Parkes
run the risk of so common a death. They don't fire-
works measley people.

1861 Sir 'Enry denounced [free trade in land, and pro-
posed that the free-seleotor should receive the land in
tee simple onpaymant of a 5i. deposit. In 1877 he
denounced the alienation of the public estate, and tho
formation of largo estates by monopolists. In 1882 ho
sat quietly down and twiddled his thumbs and spoke of
the weather, and the desirability of preventing hens
from laying eggs on the Looard’s day, while his
“paidner" brought forth an abortion of an Act by
which alienation and dummying would be made as
simple as the process of failing off a log. This looks as
if some persons changed tneir mind as well as their
matter.

“The appointment of the committeeMessrs.

fession that the Government do not know wiiat reforms
are required in the land laws of tho colony ’’ Farther
on, the|Hust sxys :—“Wo are bound in fairness to
assume that it is not known what the recommends-
tions of tha commission will be. though, of course, in
the present case, it is thoroughly well known." So the

quired, but they “ thoroughly well know" what
recommendations (which, it ia argued, they are pre-
pared to follow) will be made 1 B&hl Messrs Morris

It is currently reported that Mr. John Davies
is organising a seoret mass-meeting of Orangemen, to
decide upon an opponent to Mr. Copeland at East
Sydney. It appears that Mr. Copeland has never culti-
vated feelings of animosity against any fellow-colonist,
merely because tne %tter chanced to be a Roman
Catholic, and this laokJtf seetarlan hate in his consti-
tution is regarded assuflhieat reason why every bigot
should do nis best to shut the door of political life
against him. As Mr. Copeland has never expressed
hatred of Protestants either, the Roman Catholic
clergy will not be doing their duty if they don’t
organise a roll-up against him also. A man who doesn’t
hate his neighbour for the lave of God is obviously
unfit to legislate in a snffloiently partial and crooked
spirit. No scoundrel who is so infamous as to believe
in liberty of oousoienee should omit to vote for Cope-
land.
From the Protestant Standard :— “ The
Evbniro News and its friends—No sooner has tbe
Sarty so strenuously pushed forward by the Evening
ixws got what it has been so ungrammatically clamour-
ing for than it has been turned upon after the fashion
of the swine before whom pearls are oast. Mr. Cope
laud, one of its pets, compare j it to someone who had
been given a pail of milk aud suddenly upset it with his
•cow’s foot.’ *So perish friendships only made in
wine,’ says tho Laureate. ’ 8o perish friendships only
made In revenge,’ wa may here well say, Onr evening
contemporary gives Mr. 8tuart and hie party less than
four months of effloe. Sir Henry will no doubt laugh in
his sleeve at the estimate. Be that as it may, it is
fanny that the organ is ns indignantly opposed to t’. e
new mon as to the old, and whom it would have in
power it is difficult to say, but its indigeant opposition
is always accompanied by fits of the queerest English
composition ever uttered."
The following is a digest of the speech delivered
by the Governor at the opening of Farliamont: —The
retirement of the late Ministry on tho day appointed
for the opening of Parliament has thrown the business
back, and the re-election of Ministers has added to the
delay. Owing to various oau-es, Supplies have yet to
be voted. The attention of Parliament will be asked to
the tact that the expenditure daring the past year has
been in excess of what Parliament had sanctioned.
Tho estimates tor this yeir will be submitted at once.
Th«re ia a nominal surplus of £250,000, but swallowed
up by various deficiencies in appropriations. The ses-
sion will be short; but urgent legislation will be at-
tended to, viz., consolidation and amtudmenc of
criminal law; oouver.ion of loan into inscribed stock;
amendment of the Licensing Act; and extermination of
rabbits. Administrative action will be taken with
respect to establishment of High-Schools and regu-
lahon of Civil Service. A Land Reform Bill will bo
prepared ready for next session.
We have incidentally heard that, in Newtown,
political differences are baing intruded into business
f ifiirs. We have been told that tbe owner of a brick,
yard, who voted for Mitchell, is being subjected to a
sort of Boycotting. Business mon, who supported Mr.
Ooieland s candidature, have withdrawn their custom,
aud his kilns are useless. We protest, iu the strongest
sense, against such outrageous proceedings. The
exercise of the franchise is a sacred right, and every
voter has a right to his opinions. Such a course as is
reported to have been taken in this iuttanca is simply
deferred intimidation —a villainous resource, calculated
to undermine our nei institutions. We think those
electors who voted tor Mitchell made a stupid mis-
take, and in eotne oases, doubtless, wore swayed by
selfish motives. But we can’t —no one can—entir into
i heir miadj and explore their motives. This Boycotting
svstem is, thank heaven, uncalled for iu Australia.
Only extremis hardships, aud denial of all legitimate
methods of correcting a wrong or an oppression, can
ever justify resort to it. It is suited tor the oircum-
Btanots of Ireland, Poland, or Eusaia, or oven the
Highlands of Scotland, where dominant classes close all
the ordinary avenues of reform. But it is not needed
here. Whoever has started the process iu Newtown
is no true adherent of the principles of Young Aus-
tralia and Honest Administration.
The Daily Telegraph makes a double-
column j uxtaposition of the respective comments made
by the Herald and Echo— whose family eonneotion
is well known —upon the appointment of Messrs.
Morris and Kmkeu to report up >-ii the condition of the
public estate. Though it ni?.v be argued that in the
one case the comments are editorial, aud in the other
are the personal opinions of “Uawkeye," yet it must be
admitted that the double-coiuaming reveals a glaring
inconsistency. Th extracts were juxtaposed because
it suited the card of the D. T. How much more pro-
fitable aujl telling wouldn't it have been t© make a
double-column comparison between the opinions of the
Evening News at ths last election against sectarianism
and the appeal of that journal to the electors of New-
town to pill Copeland, because ha was an atheist-—
which is a brazen lie. The enly proof brought in
support of this allegation is that Copeland caused the
Art Gallery to be opened on Sundays, a course of
action of which th'x News wxa one of the chief
supporters. But King-street difin’t want to lift that
veil, because exposure of the News would expose itself,

Mr. Joseph Mitchell was on Saturday last
elected for Newtown, having polled 1219 votes, as
against 1217 recorded for his opponent, Mr. Henry
Copeland, the new Minister ft.r Works. Mr. Copeland’s
action in abandoning his up-oonntry constituency, and
contesting Newtown, was characteristically bold. The
electorate ia full of dissenting chapels, and seems to
be politically bossed by a lot of small and holy shop-
keepers of the Sunday-black.cont-and-fhining-tile cum-
shaved-nppeB-lip order. Mr. Mitchell, who runs a
retail wood and ocal store and does a geod business
there, is a pleasant-locking sort of person, possessed of
education and ability quite up to the coal-business
standard. He has not, however, hitherto been con-
sidered very holy. That such a constituency as New-
town, which has on former occasions returned to Par.
liament perfectly invertebrate persons, should have
selected Mr. Mitchell in preference to Mr. Copeland,
oxn occasion no surprise. The victory gained by the
party of Bigotry and Corruption—the party bent on
grabbing the political birthright of Young Australia,
and acclimatising in this country the bloody religions
quarrels of old-world superstition—is a very narrow
one, and should encourage those who love Sydney, and
are determined to know nothing about Derry, to put
forward on the first opportunity a cultured and liberal
—and, if possible, a native-born —candidate, with a
view of wresting the seat from the nonentity just
elected.

Mr H. Copeland for East Sydney.
The Progressive (or Australian) Party of East Sydney,
which achieved such a signal victory when recently
appealed to, is to be called upon in a few days to again
declare against Corruption and Old-World politics, and
in favour of straightforward Constitutional Government.
Mr. C- pelaud appeals to the great mass of the East
Sydney electors who sent their four men in at the last
great contest, and who indignantly resented the attempt
Jast week, of the Calico Party to foist a nonentity on to
the constituency in preh ranee to Mr. George H. Eeid.
Tbe Calico or Corruption Party, which met with such a
decisive overthrow throughout the country, secured a
small victory at Newtown, last Saturday, with the
combined assistance of certain jackals and underground
plotters. But this temporary reverse is to be wiped
out in the return of Mr. Copeland for East Sydney.
The great'body of electors know the issue. It is dis-
tinotlv their cause against that of the Calico Party
defeated at the last election, with a few curs who are
well out of the ranks of the Party of Progress. The
3000 or 4000 men who voted for the FOUR at the
General Election must determinedly go to the poll, and
record their votes. The result is then right.
There is a description of Sir Henry Parkes in
the Queenslander, by a writer whose observations
were made during the ex Premier’s recent speech at the
Temperance H all. The remarks are made that “ when
younger, Sir H»nry Parkes must have keen an ugly
man. Except the eyes, and perhaps a little contempt
about the half-open lips, there is nothing commendable
in his face. His nose would not pass muster in a
shearing ehed. The common dam-sinker would not
exchange foreheads. , 11 This is scarcely more civil
than the Evening News’ famous description of Sir
Henry’s mouth as resembling “ a gash made by a toma-
hawk in a bladder of lard." Tbe fact is that Sir
Henry’s countenance does not stand dissection. It
corresponds with his career in that respect. He and
his political history require, alike, to be regarded from
a sufficient distance to render the details indistinct.
Thus viewed. Sir Henry’s aspect is not lacking in im-
pressiveness. The form of his head and features con-
veys an impress of power, and even of dignity. It is
the same with his public life. It is thus that
those who know him least, or are least
capable of analysing his career, most respect
him. A man who has maintained so long as Sir Henry
the prominence that politician has enjoyed, without
advantages of birth and with positive drawbacks in
education, cannot be a puny man. It is only when we
come close to investigate, th’t one perceives of what
inharmonious and repellant separate traits that large-
mss is built up. The eyes which seemed to the Queens,
lander's correspondent relieving traits iu the counten-
ance, are really the worst features in it. They are
disproportionately small, sly, twinkling, and simian.
Strikingly so to anv one who sees their owner closely
face to face fer the first time. So with his big career.
Scrutinized closely, it is made up of a number of “ hepi-
sodes ’’ which are disappointing from their lack of moral
symmetry, and repellant owing to their defect ivs
principle. No candid man will deny that Sir Henry
Parkes bar power in hi- mental constitution. On the
contrary, they admit and lament the fact, because the
greater his ability the greater the danger to the comrr-u-
nity, inasmuch as that ability has been generally
directed to cross purposes and crooked answers.
