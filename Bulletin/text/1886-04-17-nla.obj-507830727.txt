The Contract of Monarchy.
The Bulletin .
SATURDAY, APRIL 17, 1886.
“ The health of the Queen, proposed by Lord
Hobhodsb, was received with a burst of
hisses.” This was at a dinner given to the
English Labour representatives on the 24th
February, at the Criterion, London. About
two-thirds of the banqueters refused any
other response and obstinately kept their
seats, while the minority honoured the toast
in customary fashion. A week before this,
at a complimentary banquet to the Liberal
member for Mid-Derbyshire, a suggestion to
close proceedings by singing the National
Anthem was strongly objected to, and on
being put to the meeting, was rejected by
nearly 150 votes. Hissing and groaning
mingled with the cheers which saluted the
Queen when entering the House of Lords to
open the present session of Parliament, and
on the 26th February, the London Standard,
the recognised organ of the extremist Con-
stitutional Toryism, dared to assert that—
“ There is no room In theEngrllsh Constitution
for a Sovereign who lives in almost complete
seclusion. . . The Scotch moorr&nd the waters
of the Solent are more attractive, more peaceful,
and more invigorating than the air of Buckingham
Palace and St. James' Park. . . In the long run
nothing can stand in this country that baa not
public opinion and public sentiment on its side,
and sentiment is not kept alive by seclusion on
the part of the person'.wbo should Inspire it.”
Emphatic demonstrations of “ disloyalty ”
such as these prove that members of the three
main parties of English politics are dissatis-
fied with the Sovereign in so great a degree
that they are impelled to manifest their
displeasure and sense of injury in a manner
which in each case is certainly “disloyal,”
and in either case also borders upon sedi-
tion. Had these “ signs of the times ” been
observed only at gatherings of the ignoble
and uncouth, no very great amount of
significance would perhaps attach, but coin-
cidently with the demonstrations at Radical
and Liberal gatherings comes the dictum of
the Tory Standard : “ There is no room in
the English Constitution for a sovereign who
lives in almost complete seclusion.”
* ♦ *
A noticeable point about the Standard’s
statement is that the grievance complained
of, and regarded as of such importance as
to imperil the occupancy of the Throne, is
simply Her Majesty’s “seclusion.” This
places in a strong [light the Tory require-
ments from royalty. Continual pageantry
and magnificent mummery must surround
the Throne if the Sovereign is to retain her
position thereon. It is evidently not neces-
sary to the Tory appreciation of a monarch
that he or she should be intelligent, gener-
ous, or virtuous; all that is demanded is
that the unpardonable sin of “seclusion”
should not be committed. From the utter-
ances quoted, the deduction is clear that a
Sovereign who is not commended by con-
tinuous display is not worthy of a place in
the British Constitution. Had the Standard
seen fit to censure the Queen for any alleged
indifference to the sufferings of the poor;
on account of neglecting t to patronise and
encourage the arts and sciences, or for any
disgraceful promotions of a lot of lazy and
dissolute German favourites at the expense
of the nation, the criticism, harsh though it
would have been to the Monarch, would
yet have served to commend the system; but
to condemn the Queen on the grounds of
her seclusion is to condemn with the same
words the system of Monarchy, which, ac-
cording to the Tory view, needs pageantry
to render it capable of maintaining its place
at the head of the Constitution.
- • •
Contemptible as may be the necessary
a ttributes of a sovereign according to the
Tory view, it is satisfactory evidence of the
advance of thought that even apologists of
royalty demand something, although it be
only abstinence from seclusion, from the
Sovereign. The Tories when they first became
prominent and acknowledged as a party,
based their creed on what Hallam defines as
“ the indefeasible hereditary right of the
Crown and the duty of absolute non-resis-
tance.” Then it was that Brady tried to
prove that Magna Charta, the first book of
the Bible of British Liberty, and all other
Constitutional enactments were but “ re-
bellious encroachments on the uncontrol-
lable imprescriptible prerogative of mon-
archy.” Then, too, Sir Robert Filmer
wrote“ As kingly power is by the law of
God, so hath it no inferior power to limit it.
The father of a family governs by no other

law than his own will, not by the laws and
wills of his sons and servants. ... The
direction of the law is but like the advice
and direction which the king’s council gives
the king, which no man says is a law to the
king. ... A man is bound to obqr the
king’s command against law, nay, in some
oases, against Divine laws.” In the same
reign, too, the Tories had asserted in their
addresses of loyalty to the Crown that the
king ought to exercise all his prerogatives,
unprompted by, and if necessary, in de-
fiance of, the unsolicited declaration of the
people; hence, they became known as
“ abhorrers,” because they expressed their
abhorrence of the Whig petitions presented
in the hope of influencing the conduct of
the king. It is necessary to notice these
doctrines, because, as we shall endeavour to
show, they are those, which, designedly
or not, influence the Abigails of New
South Waits polities, and induce them to
make an outrageous burlesque of their
alleged loyalty.
• • •
It is abundantly evident that the Stan-
dard has seceded from the traditions and
doctrines as quoted which corstitute the
foundation of Toryism. Its conductors
recognise the undeniable fact, taught by all
impartial history, and evidenced by such
constitutional compacts as Magna Charta,
the Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settle-
ment-compacts which kings were sworn
to observe before they were allowed to
accept or retain the Crown, that monarchy
is the result of a national contract
between the Sovereign and the people,
enforcing mutual obligations, conferring
certain specified rights, and entailing certain
duties, upon neglect of which, penalty to the
offending party may ensue. That any
contrary vfew has ever been held is only to
be accounted for by the interested ravings
of the clergy, the designing and corrupt
flattery of a venal nobility and Court, and
the ignorance, superstition, and consequent
gullibility of the people. The liberties
which British subjects now enjoy were
almost without exception bought by sub-
sidy, or other money grant, or else won by
successful rebel’ior. Kings and queens
throughout English history have bargained
with their Pailiaments until the balance of
money and redress of grievance was made
to the satisfaction of each party; and of
the four great Statutes upon which our
Liberty is secured, Magna Charta was wrung
from King John at the. sword’s point: the
Petition of Rights was agreed to by Charles
I. that his crown might not be taken from
him ; the Bill of Rights William of Orange
was sworn to observe before he was
acknowledged as ruler; and the Act of
Settlement prescribed the terms upon which
the successors of Queen Ann* were to be
admitted' to the fovereignty. These enact-
ments furnish indisputable proof of a com-
pact between the monarch and the people*
but there are other obligations, not to be
found in the written Constitution aU
though indicated by its tenor. Different
English parties define these duties incum-
bent on the sovereign according to the dic_
tales of thtir various doctrines, but all ar®
agreed that such obligations exist. The
Radical demands from his highest earthly
ruler an example of morality and virtue*
the Liberal requires that the King or Prince
should be a patron of the arts, literature >
and science, and the more modest Conserva-
tive asserts that the sovereign for whom
“there is room in the English Constitution ”
should gratify the nation with a display of
vain pomp and empty pageantry.
♦ * •
Seeing, then, that the sovereign is one of
the covenanters to a bilateral contract
entailing certain duties, upon the due per-
formance of which the maintenance of the
compact itself depends, it follows that criti-
cism by the people of their Queen’s action
must be incident to her possession of the
Crown. That this criticism may take the
form of censure, and that the people are
justified in censuring what their judgment
or observation leads them to condemn, is
also indisputable. True loyalty never did
demand that men should pass over in ap-
proving silence that which they could not
commend in their sovereign. When George
the Fourth was the nation’s “fountain of
honour,” the degradation of his Court and
the notorious vioiousness of his own conduct
were matters for which it was the manifest
duty of every virtuous subject to openly
and unreservedly censure the King. Parlia-
ment, at appropriate times, may criti-
cise the sovereign, and the same right is
possessed by every subject. Again, the king
may, if he choose, put an end, by abdication,
to the contract upon which he has entered;
while, on the other hand, he holds his high
position only by the constitutionally-im-
plied consent of his subjects. If they decide
through their representatives that they are
unwilling to maintain their king, his con-
tinuance of regal power is impossible.
Therefore, as this option of withdrawal
from the original agreement rests with the
subject as well as with the king, the right td
hold an opinion as to the advantage of con*
tinuing the contract is common to every
citizen. If the monarch misuses his posi-
tion, so that the power given to him to ex*
eroise for the benefit of his subjects become
a national curse, public indignation may be
rightfully expected. That Queen Victoria
has been accused of a neglect of her royal
duties to the detriment of the nation is well*
known, and the Labour banquetters who
hissed the toast of loyalty at the Criterion,
as well as those who refused to sing the
National Anthem in Mid-Derbyshire, and
the aristocratic and Conservative Standard
which voiced the indignation of its party,
are rather to be blamed for the excessive
moderation of their conduct than on ac-
count of its probable offensiveness to Her
Majesty.

Popular sentiment on these points in New
South Wales, if measured by the legislation

Me. John Cash Neild, M L.A.,
Mr. John Cash Neild, whose portrait graces to-
day The Bulletin’s first page, is, now that we
have lost Burdett Smith, the Beau Brummel of the
N.S/W. Asaembly,;in which he has represented
Paddington since last, general election—a contest
whereof the most important feature was the
entry to public life of the subject of this notice.
Mr. Neild, whose personal appearance would
adorn the Faubourg St. Germain even on a fete
day, has already politically wrecked himself by
publicly posing as an Inveterate and miserable
punster. He drifted into Parliament on a sea of
bad jokes, and may possibly continue there for a
time if he holds on to the coat-tails of Orangeism.
Mr. Neild is a musician, and a tolerably execrable
poet. His age has never been definitely ascer-
tained, but he is at least old enough to know
better.

taught that the king was not only above
human law, but above Divine law as well,
was regarded as a reliable authority. Only
by supposing that Mr. Abigail holds royalty
to be equal to the Deity, can his extra-
ordinary letter to the Colonial Secretary de-
manding instant enquiry into the alleged
hooting of Her Majesty’s name at Botany
be explained. If, as we maintain, the Queen
is the creature of law, she ia necessarily re-
sponsible if her actions be not shoh as the
Constitution requires. To say that she is
above criticism and censure is to assert her
independence of all human law; to maintain
that all her actions are worthy of praise is
to assert that she is possessed of direct and
continuous Divine control. The conduct of
the “professional loyalists” of N.S.W. in
describing the Queen as a model for the
angels is akin to the practice of the coiners
of the national money, who represent Her
Majesty’s fat, heavy, German face in pro-
file as that of a classic Grecian maiden of
some sixteen summers. It would be inter-
esting to ascertain Whether the orators who
so fervidly describe what the Queen ought
to be, and not what she really is, themselves
believe in the truthfulness of their lauda-
tory periods: if so, they are two hundred
years behind the age; if not, their ultra-
loyalty can only be assumed for a purpose,
and will at once be rejected when that pur-
pose can no longer be served.
* * •
The glaring contrast between the popular
English view of monarchy, and the “loyal”
view of it in New South Wales is one which
does no credit to ourselves. Had a number of
men .deliberately, ‘and with unmistakeable
emphasis, refused to drink the Queen’s
health here, we doubt not but that
another Martin would have come forward
with a second Treason Felony Act, declar-
ing such a refusal to be a treason, entailing
two years’ imprisonment on the offender ;
and, judging by precedent, the Sydney
Morning Herald would have eagerly sup-
ported such a piece of legislative degrada-
tion, but in England the action affords a sub-
ject for a few brief newspaper paragraphs*
and there the matter ends. And again, if
The Bulletin had ventured to print on its
own authority the Standard condemnation
of the Queen, it is safe to suppose that the
entire staff would be now in Darhnghurst.
Tet, after all, the Standard has done wisely
in demanding a quid pro quo from the
sovereign. Monarchy in England cannot
be long sustained unless a reasonable return
be made to the people for their support and
fealty. Sincere loyalty to a sovereign who
refuses to do anything to merit support is
utterly unreasonable.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Rebellious Orangemen.
Lord Randolph Churchill, finding that the
English Commons are determined to give Home
Rule to Ireland, has set himself to stir up the Irish
Conservatives and Orangemen to rebellion against
the Parliament and Queen. Speaking at Belfast
he is reported to have said: —
“In the North, the great privileges you possess
are worth defending, are worth demonstrating for,
and by Heaven they are worth fighting for. Ido
not myself fear that so heavy a trial could be put
upon you, but 1 impress upon you to keep the
organisation in perfect readiness.” (Cheers.)
Hero is a spectacle for the godsl A leader
of that Tory party whose object is the main-
tenance of the Constitution, urging the Orange-
men, the professional loyalists, whose only
excuse for the existence of their organisa-
tian is their supposed loyalty to and defence of
tholCrown and Constitution, to set all the powers
of Government at defiance if so heavy a trial as
Home Rule is “ put upon ” them. The ultra-
loyalists, in the event of a certain action of the
Commons, are to become revolutionists: the con-
servators of the Constitution are to array them-
selves in rebellion against it. Startling as the
poaition.is, it is by no means novel. The disap-
pointed Royalists at the Restoration threatened
subversion of the Crown, which, before the Com.
monwealth, they had asserted to be a Divine gift,
and In the reign of James 11. th® same clergy who
had talked themselves hoarse in teaching the doc.
trine of “absolute non-resistance” and "unlimited
passive obedience ” to the Divinely-directed will
of the king, as long as that will inclined in their
own favour, intrigued against James, and rebelled
against his authority as soon as he refused to sub-
mit to their dictation. It is evident that the Con.
servatives and Orange Loyalists only regard
patriotism as a virtue when the Royal and National
favour inclines to them, and so it comes that the
teachers of the “ right divine of kings to govern
wrong,” forsake their maxims and become rebels,
as soon as their own wishes are disregarded. The
bigotry of these Irish Orangemen dominates their
loyalty, as it does that of their Australian
brethren. For two centuries the Orangemen
have posed as fervidly loyal subjects, while the
Romanists have been denounced as rebels; now,
when legislation seems likely to confer a too long
withheld right on the latter, the professed loyalists
cheer seditious spoutings, and keep their organi-
sation prepared for acts of high treason. Hynd-
man cried for Socialistic reforms, while Church-
hill, for party purposes, preached undis-
guised sedition. One was accounted a disrepu-
table agitator, and has been in the dock for his
action, while the other and more guilty offender
is saved by his “nobility” from any legal or
social punishment. The further development of
Irish affairs will now possess a new point
of interest, Orangelsm has declared not only
at this Churchill gathering, but at lother recent
meetings that loyalty must subserve imagined
self-interest, and should therefore be regarded as
a creed dangerous to the State and the public peace
of the Empire. This attitude of Orangelsm on its
native soil will embarrass the Australian members
of the Order. They must either sacrifice their
loyalty or their allegiance to the source from
which they sprung. If the former, they will take
the place of the conspirators discovered at
Kiama long ago; if on the other hand they forfeit
their allegiance to Ulster, they will admit that
their order only exists for the purposes of making
members of such men as Abigail the Fonetik*
Neild the Stale-pun Oracle, Henson the Pious,
Lloyd of Glorious Memory, Holborow the
Horator, and other such political “ duffers.”

Du Barry on Divorce.
Dli. Barry, of Sydney, refreshed by his long and
invigorating New Zsaland trip, has announced by
letter and sermon his determined opposition to Sir
Alfred Stephen’s Extension of Divorce Bill,
Had be confined bis utterances to his own fol-
lowers, notice of them would perhaps have been
unnecessary, but as he professes to attempt to
stem the tide of progressive legislation, he sub-
mits himself to public criticism. Of course, like
all other ecclesiastical debaters, he bases his oppo-
sition upon that verse, St. Mark xix , 9, which for
1000 years has been able to oppose any large
reform of the divorce laws, and from the unction
with which he dwells on it one would think that
every word of the Bible was a law to him. If one
verse of an answer given to the Pharisees is of
such import to a people who are 1800 years ahead
of them in civilisation one would think that every
sentence would be observed in letter and spirit by
a bishop. Yet only a dozen verses further on we
find the Great Teacher saying, “ If thou wilt be
perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven ;’>
and really we don’t remember to have h<?ard that
Dr. Barry has given up his little £2OOO, or whaf
ever his billet may be worth, for the benefit of the
poor. And, in the same chapter we read, “It is
easier for a camel to go through the eye of a
needle than for a rich man to enter into the
Kingdom of God,” but in spite of this we fail to
recollect’ that Dr. Barry has ever preached
much about the iniquity of possessing riches t
Further, we distinctly remember to have read a
Scriptural injunction to “Take no thought for
your life what ye shall cat, neither for your body
what ye shall put on;” yet, as far as we know, Dr.
Barry seems to be reasonably well nourished,
and his dress looks quite the thing in cut and
quality. We don’t say that the Bishop should
not look after himself, his dress, and his screw,
just as he does now, but it will appear strange to
all except his own flock that while he should
insist upon the universal, literal application of one
verse of Scripture, he should apparently refuse to
literally apply to himself and teach his people these
other texts of the Bible. Dr. Barry admits our
contention of last week when he says:
“Of course all thoughtful men must have known
the individual hardships and temptations which
ensue when the marriage tie, remaining still un-
broken, is not hallowed by the mutual love and
self-sacrifice which both nature and Holy Scrip-
ture so emphatically teach. They cannot but look
with sorrow and deep sympathy on the darkening
and wrecking, through these causes, of so many
Innocent lives ”
Accepting this admission, we do not think it
necessary to traverse the remainder of his ful-
mlnation. It is because we look with “deep
sympathy on the wrecking of so many innocent
lives,” that we desire to see an amendment of the
divorce laws. To permit and continue the wreck-
ing of innocent lives Dr. BARRy produces a com-
mand given to a people amongst whom a dissatisfied
husband was able to put away his wife by his own
act, and with whom bad cooking was a valid plea
for this home-made divorce, and insists upon its
literal observance with the people of our genera-
tisn who propose still to leave it to a Court to
pronounce its decree. When Dr. Barry acts ia
complete accord with the other passages we have
quoted, we will re-consider his argument.

The Grand Old Man.
It is evident, from this week’s cablegrams, that
Mr.'.GLADSTONE’s Irish proposals have landed him
in a position of immense difficulty, and he must
indeed have a lion’s heart, such as no statesman
since Cromwell has possessed, to undertake such
a work as the liberation of Ireland without the
help of, and even in opposition to his colleagues.
Chamberlain, Trevelyan, Bbneage, and Lord
Morley secede from his Cabinet, and yet he per-
severes. Lord Hartington stands up and offers,
in the name of the “Moderate Liberals,” to
coalesce with the Tories, and still he does not
waver. Whatever may be the outcome of the
fight, history shews no more splendid spectacle
than that of the ” Grand Old Man ” entering single
handed into this struggle against such desperate
odds on behalf—not of his own country, but of
a people hot with the deadly hatred and resent-
ment that springs from the wrongs inflicted on
them by his country in generations past.
His present Isolated position reminds one forcibly
©f Cromwell who, when not by any means sure
of his power, told his colleagues, Lord Exeter
and General Fairfax, that they had better go
over to the Royalists, and then England would
know herfoej. Mr. Gladstone s real loss, how-
ever, is in the secession of Joseph Chamberlain
who specifically stated that helresigned his position
rather than pay over £250,000,009 to the Irish
landlords. Even this, however, is quite justifiable
on the broadgrounds that it was through England
that Ireland was saddled at all with the vile incu-
bus of landlordism which—
" Like some loathsome ulcer that leechcraft can-
not cure,
Has gradually eat away the substance of the
poor,”
and that England should pay for its removal.
But still it is hard to see such sums of money,
wrung chiefly from the toiling millions of Eng-
land, going into the hands of those men who have
sucked the blood of Ireland till she has no more
wherewith to supply them, To the weak-
kneed Hartington and his followers the great
Gladstone, serene and steadfast at 77, might
justly apply the words of Cromweli. referred to
above. There is no more of the desire to secure
human rights for human beings—which is true
Radicalism—in Lord Hartington and his aristo-
cratic and plutocratic following than in the out.
and-out Conservatives. Now that the “live” por-
tion of the “Liberals” of England have become
“ Radicals,” the residuum, the “Moderate Whigs,”
• ate nothing more nor less than “Tories that are
ashamed of themselves.” Lst them go over to
Lord Salisbury, and “let England know her
foes.”

Capital v. Combinations.
Mr. GdoDOHAP, the New South Wales Commis-
sioner for Railways, in trying to prevent the for-
mation of a union of the railway employees, like
Bishop Baßry in opposing the extension of
divorce, is simply matching his strength against
the gathering force of the tide of modern thought
and action. Each of these men may, perhaps,
succeed in stemming the flow of that tide,
but it so in either case it will be but a tem-
porary triumph, the prelude to a disastrous
defeat. Mr. QoodChap can hardly have noticed
the course of modern history if he is not aware
that the sellers of their labour having long ago
realised that to attempt to contract with capita*
unless they themselves wore united was
simply to ensure ruinous depreciation of
the value of their only capital—their power
of mental or physical exertion have
found their only defence in organisation and
combined resistance. The contracts of the
future must be made by united Labour covenant-
ing with Capital. Now that the workers have
found that by combination they can make and
preserve advantageous treaties With Capital, it
would be a retrograde policy, foolish in the ex-
treme, to abandon anything that has been gained
and all that facilitates the formation of these
unions, and as modern civilisation cannot stand
still, there must ever be increasing efforts to in-
crease by the means found so efficacious in
the past, the number and strength of such organi-
sations. This movement on the part of the railway
employees is merely the precursor of others in all
branches of trade. That many disastrous encoun-
ters will ensue while the forward advance of
Labour is being made is unfortunately a matter of
certainty, but not until Capital and Labour, meet
upon equal terms,—become allies instead of
foes—will the full advantages of their efforts
accrue to the State,
"Mock-piety as a palliative of Criminal Of-
fences” would be an interesting subject for
an essay. la Geelong, the other day, a
sanctimonious water-rate collector was charged
with embezzlement. The worthy got off with
a couple of months or so, on his counsel s
pathetic plea that “ the money hadn’t been
squandered in drink or betting, but was used to
supply personal needs.” Such a defence would
touch the heart of any magistrate in a hot-bed of
cant like Geelong; but, looked at from a sinner’s
point of view, it meant that the water-rate man
was a thief in cold blood. Now, hear how Chief
Justice Way ticks off Mr. Bible-text Crooks, at
Adelaide:—" Your conduct cannot be compared
with that of criminals who fall into misconduct
by being unable to resist sudden temptation, in
consequence of vicious associations, or in conse-
quence of bad early training. And as you have
yourself pointed out, the worst feature of the
case is the breach of the trust and confidence in
you.” Mr. Crooks was accommodated with “the
full term which the law allows.” Evidently then,
Geelong magistrates differ from the practical
Caiof Justice of BA. in their estimate of pallia-
tives of crime. But although Mr. Crooks brought
his piety Into the wrong box on this occasion, we
cordially recommend all intending embezzlers to
stick to text and “ respectability.” Let them
assume a virlue when they have it not, and In the
majority of Instances there is bound to be a bond
of sympathy between them and the Court.

Where has our dog Toby gone? Why, poor
Toby has been hanged, and is now being boiled
down under the auspices of the police force. The
tendency of existing regulations is to turn the
Sydney police into an army of dog-stealers,
for the constables are paid by results and
get half-a-crown per head for all vagrant
canines “run in”by them. If the zealous Consta-
ble X got half-a-soverega for each drunken
man he captured every citizen who sneezed
m'ght be arrested on a charge of delirium tremens.
But the evil now complained of does not merely
consist of the unjust incarceration of innocent
and helpless dogs. All kinds and conditions of
“ barkers,” ranging from the nameless mangy
mongrel to Maud the high-toned poodle, are
dragged into the same narrow gaol, where, we are
informed, they are kept for 48 hours or so; then
they are unscientifically strangled without benefit
of clergy. But even then the blue-coated bar-
barian has not done his worst. Toby’s corpse is
taken out of town and boiled down; his skin and
fat are sold to the tanners, and his flesh given to
the fowls. Wearotold of an instance in which a
splendid cattle-dog, “ who could do everything
but talk,” and was worth a £5O note, found his
way into the pot, simply because his master was
unaware of the ex stance of a brutal system that
assigns no value to an educated dog. If Toby
must die, let him die easily; if, however, the
hereditary prejudices of those in high authority in-
sist on Toby beiag hanged, then let him be scien-
tifically hanged. The police are paid extra for
hanging him; and we don’t see why money should
be unnecessarily expended in this direction, while
those two hulking man-butchers-the official
hangmen—to whom the colony pays £l5O and
£l2O per annum respectively, loaf around with
their knuckly fingers in their well-lined pockets.
We are told that 2500 dogs were murdered with-
out trial last year in Sydney, and that the hanging-
fees added to the proceeds of the dog-boiling
business amount to something like £4OO per an-
num. As Lord Carinoton can’t very well give
his patronage to the present Sydney dog-boiling
system, we hope to see him, in his capacity as a
good sportsman, do at least the ornamental part of
the business for a Home for Lost Dogs.

In view of recent events the advisableness of stait-
ing a Bank Clerks’ Gaol must strike the social re-
former with great force. Every colony has at the
present time several of these spruce young men
by the collar. What is the use of running them
into any of our common gaols ? They will be
compulsorily idle during almost all the time of
their incarceration, or, if there is any sort oi
nameable work given them it will be such as
carries the most trifling commercial value. The
consequence la that those bankers will have to be
fed very much at the expense of the outside pub-
lic. The young men did the general body of the
outside public no serious injury. They sinned
against the bank corporations only. But,
omitting one or two, the genteel youths re-
ciprocated the grinding parsimony of their
employers by dropping some of the employers’
sovereigns into their deep empty pockets. Ah
effort should be made to keep up the play of wits
between the two classes. The outside public should
not interfere to punish the clerk who cribs from a
grinding master, as it does not interfere to punish
a master who cribs, under the knowledge that the
market is full of that sort’of labour, from a needy
clerk. What Society wants presently is a Bank
Clerks' Gaol, supported by bank corporations, for
bank clerks alone. What it will look for imme-
diately after will be a Bankers’ Gaol, supported out
of dividends, for members of bank corporations,
who, knowing that young men have a fad for such
service, pay them only as much as keeps a very
small body and a very small soul together.

The reckless manner in which national debts are
being piled up of late years suggests the awkward
question—Will they ever be paid ? And the answer
comes in the words of Mr. Edgar Poe’s raven—
Nevermore. Taking France for an example, that
country has piled up debts to the amount of
£1,000,000,000 in about 150 years. The burden cannot
be reduced, in fact things are growing wore e
instead of better. If the French Government goes
on as it has begun, about the year 2500 it will owe
six thousand millions, and there is not money
enough in the solar system to pay the bill. What
is worse, there will not be money enough on all
this mortgaged planet to meet the interest, and if
the statesmen of the Republic hypothecate their
hopes of the hereafter and sell their share of the
golden city they will still be short. On the other
hand, France may, perhaps, start on a career of
strict economy; may give up war, abandon all
ideas of military glory, and annex no more fighting
Asiatics: and in that case it is calculated she
might pay off her debt by the year 3800 a.d.
It is pretty safe to prophesy however, that
before that date France will be gone from the
maps, and will have died insolvent. Britain is
doing pretty well in the same direction. It takes
tact and experience to owe money successfully,
but where is the difficulty that British pluck can-
not surmount? By the time that we have heard
the last of the “ three acres and a cow,” it is cal-
culated the United Kingdom will owe something
like £1,500.000.000, for England and Scotland have
to be reckoned with as well as the Emerald Isle.
Before this is paid off we are Inclined to think that
Edward the 127th will be dying of old age, and
probably by that time three cripples and a hospital
will be all that is left of Great Britain. Therefore
let us eat and drink and be merry, and meet the
misfortunes which are approaching (to the credi-
tors of our mother-land) with the courage for
which the Anglo-Sixon has so long been famed.
The loan policy of N.B.W. contrasts creditably with
that of the nations of Europe. The borrowed
money used here is all spent on reproductive
works such as railways and gaols, the latter in-
vestment showing about 90 per cent—loss-on the
dollars expended.

At Tamworth, New South Wales, the genial judge
Wlndeyer has just sentenced Joseph Cardwell to
13 years’ penal servitude and two floggings of 25
lashes each. Let us ask a question of the savages
who are responsible for the existence of the
flogging law. Why should a man be flogged when
he is sent to gaol for a-flfth of his natural life ? If
you flog a long-sentenced prisoner, a man whom
you, however justly, send into the darkness for
4380 days and nights—l 2 years—on what principle
of logic can you object to the old system of tortur-
ing a man about to die by the hand of the public
executioner ? Are the N.S.W. public such a set of
accursed fools that they believe in the present
system, or is it that they are ridden over rough,
shod by men whose views on criminal juris-
prudence are shared by the authorities of no other
nations except China and Dahomey ? Lord Caring-
ton, Governor of New South Wales, will redeem
this brutality if he wishes to let us see that he is fit
for something more solid than the distribution
soft-sawder.

a Hereby hangs a moral. B ithurst’s history is
bound up with that of the ricn gold-fields, and of

Lord Carlngton has an overplus.
In the N.S.W. Legislative Council, last
week. Dr. Creed referred to “the Intense, one
is almost . . . justified in saying, the Insane
objection of M. Grdvy, President of the French
Republic, to the carrying out of capital sentences.”
In this case the insanity, if existent, is on the side of
Dr. Creed. In England the chief executioner has
just hanged II men within 14 days-a fact which,
we suppose, can hardly be regarded as evidencing
the deterrent effect of a system which has been in
full force during unnumbered centuries, and to the
efficacy of which all history gives the He. The death
punishment, when it was impartially administered
for every class of offences, from stealing a four-
penny loaf to cutting up your grandmother,
was no deterrent —crime Increased with the
mu tiplication of hangmen. Physical death
(the fear whereof, as Dr. Creed knows
better than we do—often comes too late,
and only when an avoidable, and at one stage re
mediable disease has made fast its hold upon the
physical constitution) is but a type of the moral
death to which the mind of a deliberate murderer
succumbs, and which, like its physical analogue,
arrives not suddenly, but by easy stages. The
prospect of the gallows deterred not the old-
time outcast who coveted the fatal 415., nor
does it ever enter into or control the crooked
brain of the man whose mind is consumed by the
fierce passion of greed, or of lust, or of revenge.
When the England, which is the motherland of
Dr. Creed, fought at the behest of Pitt, to crush
the rising liberties of the human race, the first
place in the van of freedom’s legions was taken
by Republican Prance, whose people he affects to
despise, and whose immigrants he, with the assist-
ance of Mr. Darley, Q.C , would poll-tax like the
Chinese. The over-logical Frenchman has at last
come to see the folly of killing in cold blood to
repress murder. Now it is the Englishman’s
turn to have the skin removed from his
eyes. Let us quote an extract we have just
happened upon in the latest number of the most
widely-circulated of English weekly newspapers—
a Journal, by the way, which has hitherto advo-
cated capital punishment: “An unusual number of
executions have taken place within the last few
days, most of them the consequence of habitual
excessive drinking. The triple execution at Car-
lisle is likely to attract attention, but we fear the
deterrent effects are of the smallest. Instead of
seeina in the gallows the inevitable punishment for
murder, men of criminal intent begin to pick the
story to pieces, and explain why the prisoners were
caught, if only such and such a precaution had
been taken escape would have been easy. As for the
execution of men who, in the blind fury of a
drunken fit, brutally kill their wives or fellow-
labourers, the only advantage is to rid society of
their presence, and the unwillingness of juries to
give a verdict in capital oases often leads to their
acquittal. No fear of punishment will ever control
a drunkard in his madness.” We are all under
sentence of death; the preacher tells us that
weekly from the pulpit. One day a doctor visits
us: the next day (wo say this out of no disrespect
to Dr. Creed’s profession) we are dead. Yet we do
not act as if we kept steadily before us the fact
that the death-sentenee pronounced ere we .were
born would one day inevitably be executed. The
bulk of the world’s inhabitants in health behave as
If they could dodge the Destroyer; and every man
who makes murder a business, in the same way as
the soldier makes a business of war, thinks—if he
thinks about the matter all—that he can evade the
law. Capital punishment disgusts the prudent
and virtuous and brutalizes the bad.

It seems generally believed that Aksakoff,
the great Russian journalist, who died so suddenly
the other day, was poisoned. Aksakotf’s fierce
attack on the Czar’s policy in the present Bulgarian
Imbroglio brought nine warnings from the Pre's
censor, all of which the editor of the Russ dis-
regarded. As Aksakoff was tho head and leader
of Russian Pan-Slavism, it would be dangerous to
suppress him, so he died “of heart disease,” like
Skoneloff, and the Russ will appear no more. So

The latest full-grown specimen of Caring-
tonolatry from (as usual) “ Humming Bee ” in the
Sydney D.T.:—“The following anecdote shows
that Lord and Lady Carington are rapidly attain-
ing the right sort of popularity. A lady wishing
to engage a servant, and preferring one from the
country, engaged a young woman from Bathurst;
but, on concluding the agreement, was surprised
to learn one of the conditions of the engagement—
which was, that the girl sh onJ d not leave her native
town until the termination of the visit of the Go-
vernor and Lady Carington,” Let us see. What
was it that Mr. Labouchere wrote in Truth the

that he had grave doubts as to the integrity of the
Empire, but he must assure his readers that he
would take every measure in his power to curtail
the rash proposals of Gladstone, and give a dis-
criminating support only to the Salisbury Admin-
istration. He had not yet taken Parnell in hand,
but the colonies could rest assured that when the
time came their Interests would be attended to.
An Acglo-Australian paragraph:—lt will
be remembered bv many that before the new

his brother, the sixth earl, with George H. Os-

who was lost overboard on his way to Melbourne
—he, impatient of the conventionalities of his
position, having worked his way up from the posi-
tion of a common seaman to that of mate, when
an earl with £30,000 a year. Captain Wilbur, then
commander of the vessel, subsequently died, we
believe, at Calcutta, of cholera.

unexpected honour that he was at the time incap-
able of reply. He has, however, now written us
explaining that he meant no discourtesy by his
silence, and requesting that, for fear bis taci-
turnity on the occasion shouldjbe misconstrued in
official circles, we will he so good as to convey to
the Governor an answer to his question. Our
dusky countryman’s reply to the query of the
Queen’s representative is concise and suggestive.
It consists merely of one word—“ Thirsty.”
We don’t advise Wilson, Heaton, and Co.
to try any longer for baronetcies. One baronet has
been sent into penal servitude, several have got
Into gaol for drunkenness, &o , one Is a notorious
dog-stealer, two or three are “ Ashy ” insolvents,
one sweeps a crossing near the London Reform
Club, and another ekes out a precarious livelihood
by photographing rowing-men in their boats with
their second-best girls on the Thames. Even in
Australia we have known one baronet serving as
an ordinary policeman at 7s. 6d. a day, and another
shooting goats for a Queensland Divisional Board
at £l5 per annum. We are glad to see that Sir
Claude de Crespigny, baronet, has become public
hangman. That is the apotheosis of the order of
the Bloody Hand.
How are the mighty fallen! Lord Loftus’
state carriage, once our pride and delight, and in
which many a prime brood of cochins and brahmas
were hatched and reared, is now doing duty at
Oberon as a common conveyance to and from the
Caves. Great excitement was caused In Oberon
when the new owner drove to church in It on Sun-
day last. Most of the “busbies” ran howling to
the scrub and hid themselves in hollow logs when
they caught sight of the ex-vice-regal shandrydan,
being under the firm impression that It was the
Black Marla which had arrived to cart them off to
gaol. By the way, the N.S.W. Government bought
this car of Juggernaut from Lord Augustus when
he left for a hundred or two—and subsequently
sold it for a pound or two.
Oscar Wilde has, we see, contributed his
little bit to the drivelling discussion about “ the
best 100 hooks ” The ideas of this apostle of “ cult-
chaw ” appear to be as original as his toilets.
Without going very deeply into the question of
what to read, Oscar delivers himself of some
solemn words of warning about what not to read.
All argumentative books, and all books that try
to prove anything ” are to be avoided like pisun.
The long-haired humbug is the faithful mouth-
piece of that circle of society in which he moves.
They have a very natural horror of anybody or
any book that seeks to “ prove anything.” Like
Sparkler, in “ Little Dorrit,” the oracular Oscar
Wilde especially cautions his admirers against any-
one who “ wants to know, you know.”
Where on earth did Froude pick up the
extraordinary items of “ Information ” which go
to make up his parody on Australia ? He named
the parody “Oceana,” and in it styles Auckland
the workman’s paradise, and says that “eight
shillings a day are the common wages, and the
cost of living is less than in England. A poor
clergyman’s wife asked the price of some hot-
house grapes, and when told, laid them down with
a sigh, at which the dealer sympathlsingly re-
marked—’ ’Tisn’t the likes of you that can afford
them grapes; we keeps them for the working-
men’s ladies.’ ” The worst of it is that people in
England swallow such stuff as “ gospel truth,” be-
cause Froudo is the author, and, “he must know,
my dear, for he has been there, and seen for him-
self.”
Sir Charles Dilke promptly met his consti-
tuents at Chelsea to explain to them how it was
that he did not go into the witness-box to clear his
character and that of Mrs. Crawford of the charges
upon the strength of which the Court was induced
to grant a divorce. The baronet’s explanation is
similar to that made by his counsel who affirmed
at the trial that they alone were responsible for
his non-appearance. A vote of confidence was
passed at the meeting by a majority of 300 to 6,
Accepting tho statement that Sir Charles was pre-
pared to disprove the petitioner’s evidence, Mrs.
Crawford must be regarded as a deeply-injured
woman. Her character in that event has been
ripped to rags by moans of a series of false accu-
sations, which gallantry alone should have induced
Sir Charles to refute.
Thus the Seymour (Vie.) Express
“ Colonel Price is not a respecter of old age. In
speaking of the Yea Mounted Rifles, he says ’Mr.
B. Blndon is rather too old for a mounted rifleman,
and must revert to infantry.’ It might surprise
the gallant Colonel to learn that Mr. Bindon can
stick on a buck jumper that would scatter half the
gorgeously-attired ‘ staff ’ up amongst the topmost
branches of a two-hundred-foot-gum-tree. In fact
we would lay heavy odds that he is a far better
horseman than Colonel Price himself. But we
forgot. Old age is not appreciated unless running
in double harness with a fat Government salary.”
Price can't be much of a horseman if he thinks
it’s easier to!walk than I .to ride; however, a lot of
the Sydney colonels think that way. When we
are old, we hope to ride.
The Leader (the proprietors whereof per-
sonally adhere to the future Australian religion
—“Presbyterianism tempered by the rate of ex-
change ”)—remarks of the stage of scandalous
bitterness attained by the Melbourne Presbytery
in re the case of Rev. Dods, that “if Christ could
re-appear among the creed-bound professors of
lifeless theological formulas in question, it is
hardly an exaggeration to believe that he could
with difficulty refrain from applying to the re-
verend persecutors of the Soots’ Church and its
ministers the scathing rebuke he once addressed,
in effect, to a supercilious Jewish sect: ‘Woe unto
you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; ye tithe the
mint, the anise, and’Jhe cummin of scholastic meta-
physics and neglect the weightier matters of the
law, judgment, mercy, and faith.’ ”
It may be liberal-minded on the part of
Lord Carington to, as is the report, let it be known
that all sections of the community, from C.M.G.’S
up to butchers and bakers living under their
order vans, are equal in his eyes. But Is this a
contribution to sooiableness after all ? Is not its
most patent result a more acutely accentuated
difference between classes? In 1809, Governor
Macquarie, of blessed memory, issued an ordin-
ance very much like Lord Carlngton’s goodwill
utterance. He found divisions in the community,
and with a view of healing them made public pro-
clamation that colonists of all classes, convict and
free, would thenceforth stand on an equality in
his eyes. The consequences of Governor Mac-
quarie’s ordinance will, in all probability, be those
of Lord Carington’s good-natured Inexperience.
Jbhn C. Eno, the advertising fruit-salt-
man, whose wife is “ hung in diamonds,” unsuc-
cessfully aspires to a big social position in Canada
—a country which is the place of refuge for Ame-
rican absconders. A Yankee paper politely ob-
serves that “ the best society of Quebec cannot
reasonably complain of the presence of Eno. Any
man Is good enough In any part of a country that
exists largely for the purpose of affording shelter
to thieves.” In any case, we don’t think Bno
should get any social privileges by reason of his
so-called “ fruit salt,” which, like lots of other
mixtures with similar names, is composed chiefly
of a simple alkali and a simple acid. At sea it
Isn’t half as good, in the opinion of thousands, as

We see that the Prince of Wales, when
asked to give a list of the hundred persons whom
he considered the best authors, declined to furnish
the list, but contented himself with suggesting
that Thackeray ought to be excluded from it.
What a compliment for poor old William Make-
peace is here I Here is the first gentleman of
Europe giving a mere author the royal stamp of
his ignorant displeasure. That the displeasure is
a compliment need not be urged, for family affec-
tion even back to the Georges is a legitimate
element of criticism, and the Prince who will not
return a word for the sword-thrusts of the Thacke-
raya has not the blue blood with which he is
accredited. We should think the bones of
Thackeray would regain their marrow and his
faded lips would come back and smack them-
selves out of satisfaction in that he wrote nothing
that could win the praise of Albert Edward, Prince
of Wales.
In noticing the death of Earl Cardwell
we mentioned that it was he who suspended
Governor Eyre, of Jamaica. This reminds us that
a friend of eurs met the deposed Governor a few
years back. He was a patient in a private lunatic
asylum, so it is more than probable that the un-
fortunate man was already partly “gone” when
his eccentricities made such a stir in England.
Byre occupied his time in the asylum by writing
the “history of his life.” Our friend, at the doc-
tor’s suggestion, expressed a desire to see this in-
teresting volume, and poor Byre gleefully brought
him about half-a-dozen exercise-books filled with
zig-zag lines—not a single word from beginning
to end. The crazy historian devoted several hours
a day to this work, and would smile over some of
his inkiest lines with all the complacency of a
Macaulay. We presume death has relieved him of
his literary labours long ere this.
An Australian bush cook heir to an earl-
dom:—“A man known as Tom the Cook, in
Bourke, N.S.W., is reported to have come into
possession of the title and estate of the Earl of
Eglinton, He has been supplied with money, and
has gone to Melbourne to see solicitors, who are
sure that he is the right man. He is married and
has been cooking for shearers on Boomery
station.” Thomas, when he gets into his ancestral
halls, will considerably astonish the French chef of
the establishment. Just imagine Roaring Billy,
the station rouseabout, who will probably go
home as the new Earl’s valet, dropping down in
trousers and shirt, and bare feet, to Monsieur
Brillat-Savarin-Soyle, at 5 a.m., with—“l say,
Mister, the boss wants the billy boiled at wanst,
and he says if you can’t make him a damper to
day, he’ll have to run you out on your ear. And
ye’d better put ration-sugar in the old man’s tea
if you’d like to live an hour. Go out and get me
some Barrett’s twist before breakfast.”
Many old Queenslanders will rejoice to
hear that Father M’Guinness is alive and kicking.
If accounts from Kempsey, N.S.W., be correct the
kicking shows splendid fettle and pluck. Smith-
town, his present location, appears to be the ren-
dezvous of Ulster men, Connaught men, Tipperary
men, and Cork men. In such a place hair is bound
to fly. We don’t want to go into nice details at
present writing, as there is under Bishop Torre-
giani’s consideration a report dealing with the
whole business. We have met Father M’Guinness
and liked him. If his shade resemble himself he
will be excellent company in old Charon’s boat.
In the meantime, an extract from a discourse of
his in the Smithtowa chapel on March 20, and pub-
lished in the Maoleay Argus of the following
Saturday, will revive among the dwellers in the
gullies and prairies westward of Rock ham u ton and
along the shearing sheds on the crooked M’lntyre,
delightful, soul-stirring reminiscences. “On last
Sunday he stated he drove many squatters’ wives
in Queensland through the back blocks. .
” It is sad to think
that a man with such a glorious past should
be bickering with a parcel of wild Irishmen in an
obscure and disreputably-named place like Smith-
town.
When it is known that Henniker Heaton,
who really only speaks for that portion of Aus-
tralian soil which still stands in Henniker Heaton’s
boots, takes upon himself to propose in the House
of Commons such resolutions as the following, it
will at once be perceived that Henniker Heaton
needs putting down with a strong hand:—“l.
That it is desirable to place the whole naval, mili-
tary, and volunteer forces of her Majesty's colo-
nies under the Immediate control of the British
War authorities and the Government of England.
2. That these colonial forces be recognised and
enjoy all the rights and privileges of Imperial
officers and men.” The Imperial officers in the
N.S.W. service at present have—and small blame
to them I—very fine care that they are not mis-
taken for the colonial-made amateur article. It
was noticeable at the sham-fight, held at Sydney
last Saturday, in honour of General Fremantle, tin t
she professional Imperial officers present wore blue
puggarees round their helmets as a distinguish-
ing mark. Yet Henniker, with characteristic
modesty, does not propose to consult the colonies
in military matters—not he. He simply hands
them over, willy-nilly, look, stock, and barrel, to
the enlightened rule of that obese Royal owi,
George, Duke of Cambridge, commander-in-chief.
Many Victorians will-remember Foster, the
little dark crooked-eyed detective who was so
prsminent in many celebrated criminal cases a few
years ago. As daylight broke into one of the
medical wards of Melbourne Hospital the other
morning, Foster’s remains were carried out to the
dead-house, to await interment in a pauper’s
grave. He had a short time previously been re-
ceived into the institution in the last stages of
consumption, worn to a shadow of his former self,
friendless, penniless, and without even a change of
clothing. To Foster’s skill and care the public
owed the arrest and conviction of Burns, the
blood-stained ruffian who for years had made a
trade of murder, and had sent perhaps half'ft-
dozen confiding men to their last account. It was
soon after the Investigations concerting that cruel
monster that Foster retired from the service, and
then followed the sitting of the Police Commission
before which Foster gave evidenca that placed
an impassable barrier between himself and som®
of those who were formerly his comrades. In-
stead of a pension, which he might have obtained,
Foster took compensation, and commenced busi-
ness as a private inquiry agent in Bourke-street
east. But fate was adverse to him; and after ex-
periencing domestic affliction and the anxiety con-
sequent upon an unremunerative business, he
gradually sank, until he became an Inmate of a
cheap restaurant, from whence he was conveyed
in a cab one day to Melbourne hospital.
That portly cleric, the Rev. Walter Fel-
iowes—brother of the late Judge Fellows—made
quite a racy speech at a back-scratching political
dinner In Melbourne. Mr. Fellows was, in his
younger days, we fancy, a prominent member of
the Cambridge University eleven, and is still an
enthusiastic admirer of cricket. But wo never
knew till now that the reverend slogger had
" often attended a racecourse.” He has. Not as a
tract-distributor of the “Handicap to Hell
pattern, but as a genuine follower of the sport.
Once he upset Bishop Moorhouse by telling him
that he had been to the Melbourne Cup and won
£l5OO, " The Bishop,” said Mr. F., “loosed a little
astonished till 1 explained that I had met three
heavy winners and got £5OO from each of them for
the cathedral.” Wnether the Bishop patted him
on the back and said: “ Well done, thou good atu
faithful servant,” Mr. Fellows omitted to men-
tion ; but it seems to us that if the public are to b®
“tapped” in this wily fashion, Mr. F. might as
well make a book for the Loard straight out, am*
devote the profits to Christianising the N®«

Every member of the British aristocracy
isn’t giddy. There are honourable, even painful,
exceptions. The Countess of Aberdeen, par
example, is anxious to relieve the monotony of the
lives of Scotch servants. Now we, in our inno-
cence, should have recommended young footmen
for the parlourmaids, and pretty parlourmaids for
the footmen, with plenty of beef and beer for all,
as excellent reliefs from monotony. But the
worthy Countess has a little scheme of her own.
She proposes an organisation for the purpose of
supplying kitchens with a aeries of examination
papers on history, geography, biblical study, &c.
Shade of Sam Weller 1 Fancy Mary Jane and
Ohawles relieving the monotony of their lives
with biblical study I Or the cook and the scullery-
help sitting up all night with the map of Europe.
Or the butler making merry over the reign of
Bloody Mary. Oh I carry us out.
“The correct expression of the figure at
present,” says a home paper, “ is a martial bearing
on the street, and a statuesque pose at home. The
English girl now wears close-trailing dresses in
the drawing-room, stands around a good deal
against portiers, cultivates a long-armed, languid
sweep of her fan, and affects a slow, satirical
smile.” These facts will be interesting to Austra-
lian ladies, especially those who study the fashion-
able intelligence and wish to be abreast of the
times. Taking the smile in the first place, we are
informed on good authority that it is very slow
Indeed; and in the very best society a period of
15 minutes generally elapses between the
moment when the first sarcastic convulsion rends
the fair face of Britannia’s daughter and the date
when the yawning cavity closes and the girl of
the period is again at rest. The sweep of the fan
may be passed without further notice, for any
Australian lady can acquire this knack in the
mosquito season; but the English lady’s habit of
standing round and leaning against portiers is
worthy of comment \Portier, we may mention, isn’t
French for porter. As there are not many
porters in Sydney, our young ladies can
practise, if they like, by leaning up against
policemen which will do equally well. The
statuesque pose may be difficult to acquire
at first, but as many statues are very limp
and gone about the vertebrae there is a wide field
for selection. Even a lady without arms and legs
can find an old Greek image of some kind to meet
her case, and all she has to do is to look as like it
as possible. A large proportion of statues are
hopelessly dirty, but it is not necessary to carry
the resemblance so far as that. The English girl
of the period does not speak much; she does not
smoke or drink or chew tobacco; and though she
is too elegant to be kissable or huggable she is not
actively obnoxious. But that smile of hers is
fearful in its intensity, and descends upon an
aspiring young gentleman like an Alpine landslip.
If a would-be Romeo calls on her just as the basi-
lisk cacchination is getting through its introduc-
tory chapter he generally flies about the middle of
the performance, leaving his inamorata with the
coral lips still open; and then, perhaps, some other
unfortunate comes in, and beneath the balance of
the sardonic grin he sinks into hopeless insignifi-
cance and abasement.
THE SLEEPING SERVANT.
Across the ice-chest freighted air
Doth chilly morning creep,
And the much-married business man
Stirs vaguely in his sleep;;
Ihen, in a scanty robe de nuit.
He flits through barren halls,
And in an under zero voice
The servant maiden calls.
Once more between the half-chilled sheets
The flitter snugly lies,
And on 0 a.m. atmosphere
Melodious snores arise.
The clock strikes 81 The sleeper starts,
With groans of anxious pain—
Then flits once more through Arctic halls
And calls that girl again.

Lewis O’Neil was hanged at Jacksonville,
Oregon. last month, for a brutal murder. There
was nothing extraordinary in that, but there was
in the almost unparalleled request the murderer
made to his brother, an old man of t 2. The con-
demned criminal a few days before the execution
wrote to his brother at Grave Creek requesting
that he come and suffer the death penalty as a
substitute. He (the brother) being quite old, he
said, it would not be so hard on him, and it would
allow O’Neil the privilege of caring for his family
of six children, now residing in California. Since
the receipt of the letter, O’Neil, of Grave Creek,
has died, according to a local paper, from sheer
astonishment at his brother’s cheek.
The telling sneer thrown by the If'all

Poor Mulcahy, who with Ashton, were the
111-fated members of Stock dale’s exploring party,
and died in the West Australian wilderness, was
well known in Sydney. He was for some time
employed as a surveyor under the Harbours ana
lUvers Department, but he was perhapsmost pro-
minent as a member of the Redf ern Football Club,
in whose contests a few seasons ago he was a lead-
ing figure. His tall and muscular f°. rm , Bn “, t .
mendous arms were always to be seen in the thick
of every scrimmage. Big as he was, he was still
kind and gentle to all. and especially to smaller
and weaker men in the football field ; no little

opponent ever had to complain of rough usage
from “ Paddy Mulcahy.” He was ever more
considerate for others than for himself, and if
he stayed behind in the wild back country to look
after the weaker Ashton he did only what would
have been expected of him by his old comrades.
The statement that he used opium having been
extensively sworn to, cannot, of course, be contro-
verted here: but, so tar as the lost man’s Sydney
career is concerned, one might just as well accuse
Beach of such a practice. Poor Paddy, wherever
he died, he died last, and he died bravely. Peace to
the ashes of Paddy Mulcahy 1

The play is altogether too long. It begins
at a quarter to 8, and keeps at it till after 11.
There are six acts and about a dozen scenes. It
is true, that there are some middling public-

climbing up stairs so often. Besides that, next

That, however, is recognised as the initial stage of
the honeymoon. A characteristic of this stage is
intense restlessness or intense immobility. As an
instance of immobility, there was, not long ago, a
beatified couple in the middle of the front tier of
the circle. He was fully 55 and she was under 17.

had got his deeds, or a grazier who had got rid of
a mortgage. His relation to the atmosphere was
one of tightne s of skin and holding back. He

silk tie, white cotton gloves, and a black suit.
His wife was small, compact, and “made.” She
owned the tiniest specks of black eyes. She had a
little nose with a polished top on it, like the first
joint of a baby s little finger. Her mouth wa«
such a thing m one might make with one stab of
the blade of a small ivory-handled pocket-knife.
She wore a white dress with bridal flowers in
front, yellow cotton gloves, and a round bracelet.
They sat there, expressionless, motionless, hands
resting on knees, eyes cast down. They killed one
another on the stage, but neither he nor she
noticed. The audience applauded and groaned,
but neither he nor she heard. He knew he was
beside her, and that was Paradise. She knew she

But, making allowance for the restless
section and the immobile section, the fact remains
that a six-act play has too many intervals. Apart
fl^ g^e li from the matter of stairs, ladies must
find it highly uncomfortable. They are left there
every no w and again with nothing before them on

upon it with that grace and ease for which he has
a metropolitan reputation, and smile with his
wonted sweetness from one to the other of the
a P d lan goishing martyrs of an insane and
cruel custom. That would be turning an interval
of torture into an interval of ecstasy.

Quitting the question of length, however,
the Crimes of Paris ” is a great play-great in
power and In manner of presentation. The scenic
splendour of the Gardens of Belleville engage the
eye as the murderer's revelation of himself to the
widow Nicole as her son engages the mind. The
Pu? ifhfht also be called great in purpose, only
that the purpose is so conventional. It shows the
evil end that awaits all evil courses.

There is one thing we always notice with
much approbation about Mr. Templeton, and that
is the completeness of his make-up. Most actors
can be recognised directly they face the footlights,
but Mr. Templeton may be any one until he sings.
With his cleverness in this line he could travel all
through Queensland as a priest or an editor, and
no one would ever suspect him until he refused to
imbibe the flrej nice of the country. The gipsies
did not take our fancy to a great extent; we could
pick up a better-looking lot In the Domain any
day. Mind you, we don’t say that they would sing
better, or be cleaner, or less thirsty, but they
would not look so desperately like barbers’
clerks and linen-drapers on the loose. These
scornful remarks, of course, apply only to the
men. If we knew any tribe of gipsies whose
maidens were as universally beautiful and
beefy, as the girl-part of the chorus, we would
rather become a gipsy than remain in civilisa-
tion and write posters for a brewer. But
we doubt whether as lovely a tribe could be found
anywhere nearer than Woolloomooloo. Thaddeus,
Mr. Charles Harding (you notice that we are
writing this in a promiscuous style characteristic
of our geni us) who is about as necessary to the show
as bigotry to an Orange lodge, or cake to a Sunday-
school picnic, glitters with even more reful-
gence than in any role he has undertaken during
the present season, and is responsible for an im-
mense amount of wear and tear to the enduring
bluchers of the sitters in the stalls. Buda, Sophie
Harris, is the neglectful nursemaid. She only ap-
pears in the first act, from which the audience are
led to believe that she catches a violent cold from
wearing insufficient clothing and dies during the
interval. Miss Lambert was a gorgeous Queen of
the Gipsies with enough colour on her face to act
as a danger-signal on the railways. A feature in
the entertainment (we crib this from all the even-
ing papers) was the orchestra under the able con-
ductorship of Mr. Luscombe Searelle,
** * *
A slight alteration in the personnel of the
Sydney Olympic Victual Spark Company has
taken place during the week, and the result is
necessarily an improvement. We don’t mean by
this that any alteration would be for the better,
but simply that the enterprise of the management
is such as to ensure improvement whenever such
can possibly be effected. There is still a wide
field for their reformatory energies, as we do not
doubt that it is their sincere desire to bring
the singing up to the level of the “swaakey.”
By the way, how strange it is that very frequently
some peculiar look, feature, or motion of a person
reminds one of something totally different, or even
of something or someone one has seen before, yet
so long ago that the vision seems to be of another
world different in all its circumstances yet some-
what akin in construction to this. There is a
species of unconscious mnemonics which is apt
to puzzle us muchly at times. Sam. Keenan’s
mouth, for instance, always reminds us in some
unaccountable way of the Fish Eiver Caves, and
here at the Olympic Miss Lettie Le Vine (who
would do really well if she were not so over-
whelmed with melancholy) reminds us somewhere
of something that has attracted us in bygone
years. It is not her hose, they merely remind us
of a fire brigade, or a Salvation Army shirt-depot.
Possibly it is that her voice reminds us of Patti,
and as that explanation is complimentary to the
diva (we don’t say which, mind) we will leave it at
that. Miss Montagu sings several songs, which
are not absolutely new, in a moderately taking
manner, and does some nigger business which Is
i alleged to be a “speciality.” We hope that it is,
’ and that she has patented it-it would be a pity to
let anyone else get hold of it. Tae orchestra,
' under the able leadership of Mr. Schiedel (we
quote an evening paper) contributed to the plea-
sure of the audience.

“ Refinement without Vulgarity” (they
ought to copyright this phrase) continues to make
Sydney Alhambra as attractive as a free-lunoh
bar, and, we should fancy, as profitable as a billet
in the Lands Office. It is not that the business
there is so exquisitely elasslc or superlatively
scientific, but it is just about the kind to suit the
kind of people who like it, and they troop round
there accordingly. The major part of the busi-
ness is of a hilarious order, and under its beneficent
influence we are able to forget that “ bread is
rlz, that the ad valorems will make other things
do ditto, and that Dan. O’Connor is said to be pre-
paring one more oration. There is much delight
in the Alhambra, and the orchestra, under the
able directorship of Mr. Charles Austin, contri-
butes greatly to the enjoyment of the perform-
ance. Which latter piece of information we crib
from the Sydney evening papers.
m« « *
“The Great Pink Pearl ” is so profitable to
the management of the Sydney Gaiety that we
wonder they have thought it worth while to an-
nounce anything else “in preparation.” There is
such noveitv ot conception about the plan of the
piece that that goes a long way to making it boom.
The mere act of making a bailiff the vehicle of
such abundant hilarity is a revelation of Itself, for
bailiffs are not usually the ministers of mirth, and
the idea of making a journalist appear as the
lender of five millions, must have been an inspira-
tion of itself to the authors. For journalists, let
us tell you, are not usually built that way.
* * t
Of the characters, Mr. Dampier hardly
improves as the piece progresses, for his present
quaking, knee-clattering attitude is sufficient of
itself to bring mountains of suspicion to the
parties with whom he deals as to his bona Mes.
Otherwise he Is well fitted with his business. Harry
Leston, on the contrary, improves, and by this
performance has shown himself about five steps
higher on the ladder of fame than he previously
stood. Lilliearp is a careful study, and is faithful
without being Stark—we mean stiff, or unnatural.
Alfred Bootnman has not much to do besides
indulge in a series of prolonged grunts, but he
makes them indicate tne tenderest pathos, the
deepest decision, and the highest humour. He
wears an elongated moustache, a fact which of
itself testifies to his willingness to immolate him-
self on the altar of dramatic exigencies. We
thought his natural labial hirsute appendage (neat
this, moustache, you know) was sufficiently lengthy
to use as a waist-belt, but it seems not to have
been long enough for Count Keromine.
* * *
We can say nothing more about the
Pearl, except to join with the evening papers in
stating that the efforts of the orchestra, under the
able directorship of Professor Miller, contribute
greatly to the enjoyment of the audiences.

Business at Sydney Academy of Music is
not so good as it should be, but a good deal better
than it might. Lance Lenton has wisely aban-
doned his former specialties and gone for
something which is slightly more exhilarating.
Horace Bent, whose varieties are always charming
as variety should be. helps the show along con-
siderably, and Sam. Keenan and Warner contrive
to make art, of a kind, the cause of hilarity. But
there are other parts of the programme that are
quite ripe for revolution. We have once or twice
hinted that the piffero performance was not quite
so new or charming in our eyes as a last week’s
News, or a last year’s baby, and now would “ urge
with submission,” as the lawyers say, that songs of
the “Mountebank” and “Jack’s Yarn ” order,
though excellent in themselves, are now justaaout
due for relegation to charitable amateur vocalists
who sing at asylums and such places when people
cacnot get a reasonable excuse forescape. Mr.
Dunbar fetches the whole house with these and
other songs, but this is merely a tribute to his own
talent and skill. It he were to sing the Old Hun-
dredth or the National Anthem people would
applaud just the same. Beaumont Kead, too,
makes a bit of a dive into immediate antiquity to
fetch up “Only a Pansy Blossom.” This is a sweet
little b-liad and suits his voice all to smash, but if
he really wanted something new he might have
clutchtd on to “ Silver Threads among the Gold,”
which was very popular inroad a couple of de-
cades ago. An alleged “sketch” called “Cat-
astrophe ” sends the audience away as happy as a
lot of undertakers trooping out to the annual
picnic, and (we quote from the Sydney papers)
“the orchestra under the able directorship of
Nick la Feuillade plays some admirable selections
during the intervals.”

Alice Rees (Madame Vogrioh) is much
liked in’Frisco. Says the NEWSEETrBB:— “In her
present stage, Miss Bees may be termed an ad-
mirable ballad-singer. The tones of her voice
have the quality that speaks to the hearts of
listeners. It is possible that with the careful
study which was not possible in Australia her
voice will acquire the flexibility which la neces-
sary for colorature singing. She certainly could
not be under better guidance than that of her
artist husband.”

Mr. Stuart Cumberland, the “thought-
reader, runs our old friend Vincent Crummies
close in wily advertisement. Before giving his
first seance in the Melbourne Town Hail, letters
opportunely appeared ia the papers expressing
courteous doubt as to Mr. Cumberland’s marvel-
these Mr. C. condescendingly
dn response to numberless requests,
Ac.) that he would have the pleasure of dis-
pelling scepticism at the Town Hall (under the
patronage of his Excellency—front seats, 55.).
Then a learned leader upon thought-readers in
general, and Mr. Stuart Cumberland in particular,
a PPe. la the Age. Then Mr. C. wrote to thank
tne age for its “ interesting article.” Meanwhile,
pars, spiced with anecdotes of kings and princes
plentiful as blackberries. Attention was
called to a dagger (given to Mr. C. by a grand
duke at the close of some blood-curdling experi-
then being exhibited in a Collins-street
window. The public flocked to see that dagger,
and were further enchanted by a series of little
sketches, depicting “Mr. C. doing something or
another to the Emneror of Germany,” Mr. C.
flabbergasting the Grand Old Man,” “ Mr. C. as he
appeared when the Prince of Wales said “thank
you very much for a most delightful seance,' ” and
so on. Under the circumstances it is not surpris-
ing that this very practical protege of crowned
heads is exercising his mysterious arts with prolit-
able results. We shall have him in Sydney soon,
and when he comes please look carefully in the

pressing an earnest hope that Mr, Cumberland will
not tear himself away from the city before giving

quired. Bud we must be patient. Mr. Cumberland
has scarcely finished with Melbourne. Melbourne

Our old friend Edward Farley’s Mascotte
Opera Company seems to be doing magnificent
business in China, particularly with “Carmen”

quotes the Italian titles of the various numbers,

English libretto. ’ We extend the hand of brother-

Mr. F. B. Chatterfcon, once a very pro-
minent figure in the English theatrical world, died
a few weeks back. For several years Mr. Chat-
terton ran Drury Lane Theatre, and earned there-
putation of being 1 the only man in London who
had found money in the big house* Renouncing
Shakespeare as “spelling ruin” (which it did 15
years ago in London), Chatterton made " Old
Drury ” the home of spectacular drama of the
1 Amy Robsart ” pattern, and might have died in
clover if, in an evil moment, he hadn’t joined the
late Benjamin Webster in managing the Adelphi
and Princess’s Theatres. At the two latter houses
he lost the money he was making at Drury Lane,
and finally went irretrievably to smash. A good
many Australian favourites have served under
the banner of poor Chatterton. He gave Mr. and
Mrs. Williamson their first London engagement at
the Adelphi some 10 years ago or more. J. K Em-
mett, too, appeared at the same house, and Barry
Sullivan nas not “ starred” in the great metropolis
since he spelt some ruin for the then tottering
Chatterton by playing Kichard 111. at Drury Lane.
It used to be the fashion to say that Chatterton,
by catering for the masses, lowered the tone of
the English representative theatre. His standard,
anyway, was a good deal higher than that of Mr.
Augustus Harris, the present lessee, who has made
a pile out of the “ World,’’and kindred enormities.
By the way, Mr. C. was only in bis 62ad year.

Imported “mashers” will weep to learn
that Lizzie Coote died in London the other day.
She was a promising burlesque actress, and an
ideal stage street-arab. We believe that ’twas
while turning a somersault, or a “Catherine
wheel,” or something of that sort, that Miss Lizzie
met with an accident that brought on paralysis,
and untimely decease. She was the elder sister of
Carrie and Bertie Coote, well known as clever
juvenile performers.

Alfred Bashforth was flogged at Maitland,
N 8.W., week> We don’t sympathise with
Alfred. He was the man who had made the very

of being flog«ed. “Making a rod for one’s own
back”is now more than a proverb.
Quite a pathetic little incident occurred in
connection with the early closing agitation in Mel-
bourne. The secretary of the Shop Employes Asso-
ciation, an ex-draper, gave a most powerful illus-
tration of the pernicious effects of long hours on
his system. In short, he died last week. It was
reported that the dying man sent for the most in-
tractable of the shop-keepers for the purpose of
urging the principles of early closing with his last
breath. There was something so touching about
the idea that we started weeping and were half
through with a poem of surpassing pathos when
we learned, alas I that the poor secretary didn’t
send for the shop-keeper. So our muse was
“ queered.”
Good grog out of inferior glassware is less
desirable than indifferent grog out of good glass-
ware, and may it not be said in reference to food
also ? Does it not give an edge to the appetite
to have one’s food not only nicely cooked but
served in nice crockery ? After getting accus-
tomed to good glass and china on the table how

Speaking of a certain ungodly congrega-

Peter Campbell once deolared:—“ If you took a
hogshead and filled it with the spirit of righteous-
ness, and you took another and filled it with
whisky and rolled It out on this road, the
whisky-oask would be emptied in 10 seconds, while
the other one wouldn’t be looked at once in 10
years.” How that back-blocks congregation will
grin to-day when they hear of poor Peter being
found in a Flinders-street gutter fighting the air
with his beautiful feet, and excitedly enquiring:
“ Why er oorprashin doan tie down these—hie—

AtCasino (N.S.W.), a while since, aSlavonio
citizen was " tuok bad ” and hied him off to the
local hospital (which had only been just com-
pleted and was waiting for a patient). Here he was
told that his malady was dangerous and necessi-
tated a serious operation, which he duly under-
went. Asjhe was apparently sinking fast, he was
induced to his will, which the hospital
management found to be in their favour, and he
was joyfully reported several times aa defunct.

At midnight, in the bar-parlour of a bush
hotel, a well-mellowed Milesian broke in upon our
little chat, and worried us to drink with him.
As the inn was crowded—every sofa and hearth-
rug occupied—it did not occur to ua that this
“ daoent by shlep in the corner on the boords,” so
we hopefully reminded him that drinks would not
bs supplied to bis order after hours, as he was not
a boarder. Racy of his soil, he rose to the occasion
and thus he smote our wondering ears : “ No
boardher, bigorral didn’t I shleep there on the
ihlure for the lasht three nights. Now jesht tetch
that bell.” The chieftain of the Reeks fetched the
nobblers, and we pledged the ‘‘first jim of the

Take out your handkerchiefs and weep
for Mr. Kingston, of Melbourne, a victim of

Kingston drew £BOO a year as a Government
engineer, but after his dl‘missal he gave way to
drink and “ refused to work.” So now he spends
his evenings In going round to the police stations
and earnestly soliciting a night’s lodging. We
really sympathise with Mr. Kingston in his dis-
tress. The statement that he refused to work
after losing a Government billet is unfeeling and
uncalled-for. Work, indeed 1 And he an ex-Civil

The Australian public, no doubt, think
that the highly moral and intensely respectable
proprietors of the Melbourne Argus do a national
service by printing advertisements of this class
(vide Augus of Bth lnst.):-“ Wanted, a well expe-
rienced man as Compounder, able to produoe
liquors and whisky from rectified spirits*: a com-
petent man only need apply, to Border, Argus
office.” Aa the would-be employer of the *• bar-
compounder ” who can make whisky out of kero
g«toe and things, possibly lives on the Sydney aid
of the border, we hope that the Inspector-Genera
of N.S.W. Police has already got a detective to
apply for this billot. Such are the things which
come to us from the colony that has just passed
new Licensing Act.

Two Anglican parsons stood by poor John till the
last, generously proffering him the solace of re-

a glowing robe of snowy white. But the yellow-

he yearned for was good tucker; he prayed to
have the fat of the land shovelled into him during
his latter moments, till there wasn’t room for
grace. He said—this unsophisticated heathen—
that he wanted feeding up before he faded away,
so a he’d have strength to come back and kill two
witnesses who depos ' d against him at his trial.

Political
Points
Evictions still continue in Ireland. On Sir
John Stewart’s Tyrone estates the sheriff’s officers
were assisted by ICO constables.
The resignation of Messrs. Heydon.and
Slattery is now looked upon as hopeless. This
comes of both of these Parliamentary worthies
having: been a Minister for about nine minutes
Resign I They are too demoralised by fame to do
that. Having both already resigned their minds,
did they resign their seats also, they would be
“ poor indeed.”
The Berry Testimonial Committee wrote
asking Tristan, of the Seymour Express, to con-
tribute. Tristan answered that Berry had of late
“ proved himself a political curse to the colony
He gave every assistance in wrecking the Liberal"
party: and helped to place the present Conserva-
tive Ministry in power, although in so doing he
contravened the very principles of Constitutional
Government.”
Thus an editorial in the London Echo
“ It is not, perhaps, surprising that the Australians
should object to the proximity of the French, but
England has no right to attempt to exclude other
nations from annexing islands in the Pacific
which do not belong to her. By-and-bye the
colonists will be strong enough to act for them-
selves; but, meanwhile, it is not for England to
quarrel with her neighbours because the colonists
will not listen to reason.”
The Rev. R. R. Kane, of Ulster, some time
ago, advised his flock that “ for every landlord
shot they should kill the parish priest and the mem-
ber of Parliament for that county.” Kane now
says that aid from England being hopeless, the
Orangemen should apply to Germany. “ A few
German battalions,” he remarks, “ will soon make
an appreciable effect upon Irish intellect.” The
escaped nun’s N.B. W. Parliamentary friends should
get Kane out here to lecture.
Bradiaughhas just said that though the
Whigs, by revolting, might wreck Gladstone’s
Ministry, and with it end the Premier’s illustrious
career, yet by doing so they would destroy them-
selves and the House of Lords. A prophecy
which, let us add, is as true as that all men will
die. Men like M’Arthur (Australia’s chief con-
tributor to Whigdom) now have their choice for
once and all between the Tories and the Radicals
—between the Devil and the Deeo Sea. Wilson
and Heaton have, we grieve to see, chosen tbe
devil.
The King of Denmark is a Lutheran and
his children are respectively Lutheran. Anglican
Russian Orthodox, Greek Catholic, and Roman
Catholic. This diversity of views might Indicate
great independence of thought on the part of the
family, but it does not. It merely shows that the
Danish princes attach less importance to their
chances of going to heaven in company than to
the religious requirements of the different courts
to which they have emigrated. It also shows that
King Christian and his family are shrewd enough
to accommodate themselves to circumstances
when those circumstances seem good enough.
The Melbourne Presbytery is still suffer-
ing over the proposed cession of the New Hebrides
to Prance. They have got about £50.000 in the
islands, and several of their missionaries have fat-
tened and nourished this generation of savages.
One rev. gentleman at a late meeting said that the
Imperial Government should stipulate that the
church shall receive the outlay—baked mis-
sionaries and all, we suppose. But this idea did not
take with the other revs.; they would rather
cherish the feeling that the church had been
wronged until (give ear, oh Australasia!) one day
a united Australia would be in a position to settle
the account with France.
Tbe Newcastle (N.S.W.) Herald is candid:
—“ We areas much opposed to the French annexa-
tion of the New Hebrides as we were to the Ger-
mans annexing New Guinea. As England has
taken the part of first or principal robber in the
play of annexation in this hemisphere of late
years, let her keep that position in order to secure
what she has, and neither let the second robber,
France, nor the third robber, Germany, interfere
with the Imperial looting of these or any other
islands.” This is very much more honest than the
eternal whine of the grim Calvinists who want to
clutch the plunder in the name of “tbe Lorrd.”
Thus valiantly the Cooktown Courier:—
“ A great and glorious colony, rivalling in wealth
the who’e of Australia and standing forth confi-
dent in her strengtn to take her place among the
many other units that go to make up the British
i Umpire, and keep it; or merely the down-trodden
ppanage of the insatiable South, existing only to
atlsfy the greed of Queen-street politicians, and
o enable them to enrich the Southern portion of
.Queensland at our expenses. A very little time
will tell. History invariably repeats itself, and we
who live in the North are determined that even as
in the fifties Moreton Bay won her independence,
so now, in the eighties, the North shall be freed
from the greed and rapacity of Queensland.”
John James, who was appointed Minister
of Mines in the Gillies Ministry, and who was de-
feated by Murphy in Ballarat East, is acting
Minister and will act until he sees the result of his
petition for unseating his opponent. The contest
was unusually severe and all sorts of devices were
used to oust John—personation, violence at the
booths, &c—chiefly in the famed Dungaree por-
tion of the electorate, that section whose voters
C, E. Jones once addressed as “ Gentlemen of Bal-
larat—and savages of Dungaree,” and where, on
one occasion, when Townsend Macdermott, the
Solicitor-Genera), was defeated, and the crowd
hooted him when returning thanks, he fixed
them with his glazed optic and said, “ Yes, bellow
away. I have defended one-half of you and pro-
secuted the other half.” Townsend’s eye-glass was
not often seen in Ballarat East after that.
Hon. George Thornton, M.L.A., has a
queer reason in favour of the retention of those
hideous specimens of aboriginal art, the Sydney
Post Office carvings. He “ believed it would be
an act of vandalism to remove them. The fact
seemed to be overlooked that time and atmos-
pheric changes would soften and tone down the
figures, and as they became accustomed to them
their repulsiveness would disappear.” The same
factors will no doubt “soften down” a lot of
members of the Legislative Council
of N.S.W., for Instance, would never be resolved
into their constituent elements but for time and
atmospheric changes. If you could hermetically
seal up the fattest councillor in a glass case, and
stand him on his accustomed Parliamentary bench
he would stop snoring, and, barring that accom-
plishment, be as good as new in ten thousand
years.

John Roberts, the billiard champion, was
defeated by Peall in their ridiculous spot-stroke
match. The arrangement was that the men
should play alternate breaks at the spot, “ the
red to be spotted at the commencement of each
turn, and the striker to place his bail (for the
first stroke only) where he chooses. It shall be
allowable, in case of either player losing position
behind the red, to recover it by means of winning
and losing hazards in any of the usual receptacles.”
Thus, if either of them got a little out of position,
he would have the option of playing a loser in
one of the top pockets, leaving the red over one
of the middles, and regaining position by potting
the red and bringing himself to the top of the
, table again. Or be might “ stab ” the red into
either of the middle or lower pockets, and leave
himself in a line for renewed spot-stroke play. As
might be expected, the experiment was a dreary
failure. At the end of a week’s monotonous
striking, both men were heartily sick of the busi-
ness, and failed to make any respectable runs. On
one occasion during the match Peall put down the
red ball more than 300 times In succession, but bar
that, the breaks averaged no more than in an or-
dinary “all in” game. Roberts, of course, was
giving himself away in arranging a match on
these terms, as his strong point consists in his
ability to get on the spot oftener than anybody
else by means of all-round play. It was like a
a clever two-handed boxer agreeing to a one-
armed slogging bout. However, as the public
failed to bite, there are not likely to be any more
similar exhibitions.

from pyrites, which equals that got from the
stone in the first instance. We are told that this
enterprising company—consisting of a very few
individuals—who have only been at work a couple
of years, have expended some £300,000 in plant,
&0., several of their cement-dams having cost
£lO,OOO each. The mine is between 30 and 30 miles
(by a good road) from Rockhampton, and the
nucleus of the huge property, consisting of
610 acres, was bought from two poor selectors
named Gordon, who knew not its value, for £640.
Finding that the auriferous stone extended far
beyond the boundaries of their freehold, the
purchasers took up a great number of claims
under miners’ rights, the Mines Department being
so effusively good-natured as to give them “ex-
tended ” claims—four times the ordinary size—
despite the fact that the regulations which permit
the granting of those claims state that they are
only to be given in ground which has been worked

LINED WITH MEDICATED FELT
Dr. Scott's Electric Corsets and Berts.
DR. SCOTT’S ELECTRIC CORSET Is a gentle
and pleasant support, encircling the waist with
neat and accurate fit, and aiding by the vitalising
properties of electricity the functions of the
nervous organisation. Easy, graceful, and
elegant. They are worn by the principal
Royal Families of Europe, by the elite of Ameri-
can and Continental Society, and are daily en-
dorsed by over one million ladies, and as they do
not exceed in cost the ordinary goods of other
makers, without the electricity or therapeutic
value of any kind, who will refuse to give them a
trial ?
If you have any pain, ache, or ill-feeling from
any cause, If you seem “pretty well,” yet lack
energy, and do not “feel up to the mark;” if you
suffer from disease, we beg you to at once try
those remarkable curatives. They cannot, and do
not, injure like medicine. Always doing good,
never harm. There is no shook or sensation felt
in wearing them. There la no waiting a long time
for results ; electro-magnetism acts quickly,
generally the first week, more frequently the first
day, and often during the first hour they are worn
their wonderful curative powers are felt.
The mind becomes active, the nervous and slug-
gish circulation are stimulated, and all the old-
time health and good feeling come back. They
are constructed on scientific principles, imparting
an exhilarating, health-giving current to the
whole system. Professional men assert that there
is hardly a disease which Electricity or Magnetism
may not benefit or cure, and they daily practise
the same, as your own physician will inform you.
The Corsets do not differ in appearance from
those usually worn, as we substitute our flat steel
magnotods in place of the ordinary corset steels. I
They are all equally charged, different only in
quality and design. They are elegant in shape and
finish, made after the best French patterns, and
warranted satisfactory in every respect. Those
who have tried them say they will wear n® others.
Most of the above applies equally to the Electric
Belt for gents.
These goods are sent out In a handsome box. ac-
companied by a silver-plated compass, by which
the Electric-Magnetic influence can be tested. If
you cannot get them in your town, we: will send
either hind to any port or railway station in New
South Wales or Queensland, upon receipt of urine
named, with is. 6d. added; ’orwill"mail direotto

“ The Victorian railway employees have
received Instructions not to speak disrespectfully
of members of Parliament as “ deadheads.” Yes,
dear friends, the edict has been issued. Hence-
forth the irreverent porter must find some fresh
term for the non-paying senator, under penalty of
being summoned to the bar of the House. A
member by any other sobriquet would smell as
sweet. “ Fathead,” for instance—but, no matter,
let us address to the thoughtless railway men
The Melbourne Age, we are pleased to
find, bas drawn attention to what looks very like
an instance of judicial cruelty. “ The other day,”
says the Age, “ two young girls were caught
naked, and not ashamed, on the banks of the
Yarra, and sentenced to a year’s imprisonment each
with hard labour. Indecency must be repressed,
of course, though wo very much doubt whether
the culprits themselves really thought they were
doing anything outrageously indecent. .
We are not at all sure that woman’s estimate of
immodesty is always what men take it to be.”
We quite agree with the Age. Garments, say
what you will, are merely symbols of sin and
civilisation. These young girls were uncivilised,
and, probably, pure, and saw no harm in-as the
Age put it further on—” unmasking their beauty.”
They had no thought of shame as they gambolled
on the Yarra banks, and their first sense of sin
came—with the policeman who arrested them
How very appropriate! We must immortalise*
those young ladies in a Miltonic poem :—
Somehow or other, Highland regiments
are not a success in Australia, and the one recently
formed in Queensland seems, from what we hear,
to be the greatest failure of all. The soldiers
make a line display, dressed in the flowing kilt
and gaudy bag-pipes, hut, though they like the
garb, they do not roll-up all the aama. The se cret
is that It is impossible to light a match on the tail
of the Scottish garments. The colonial is always
a smoker, and a beneficent Providence created the
hindmost portions of his anatomy in order that he
might obtain‘a light thereon—but for this, in fact,
he might as well have no anatomy at all. The
modest and unwarlike pants, unlike the kilt, lend
themselves readily to his purpose; and they dove-
tail so admirably into the scheme of creation that
we believe their original plan and specification
must have been revealed from above. By throw,
log up his leg at an angle of about 75 degrees to
the horizon it is possible to tighten the less digni-
fied portion of the garment to such an extent that
it will emit sparks on the slightest friction,
but no artifice can get the required tension
from the kilt. Even the blackfellow has studied
this branch of civilisation, and though he does not
strike matches on his pants he strikes them where
the pants ought to be, which shows that he is at
least beginning to rise in the social scale. The
value of this practice from a hygienic point of
view can hardly be overrated. It promotes the
circulation, imparts elasticity to the muscles and
agility to the body (when the lighted match is not
removed in time), and makes an otherwise
vioeable part of the human frame answer one of
the highest and noblest.of purposes, by aiding to
diffuse happiness and good fellowship. But with
the introduction of the kilt all this must pass
away, and the soothing tobacco will vanish from
our midst. No one can light a match on the tail
of such a garment; no one who is not heavily in-
sured would try to light one under it, unless he
wished to encounter the risk of telng burnt to
the ground; and, therefore, the formation of
Highland corps is a direct flying in the face of
Providence, and the laws of Nature forbid that
the movement should prosper.

It’s all very well for the boys to telegraph
frpm Bathurst how delighted Lord Bob is, and
how enthralled with their reception were Lady C.
and the ubiquitous and Hon. Miss J. Wo happen
to have, however, a little better information than
all that. We—you will hold your breaths at this—
we came up with them in the train. And we have
a distinct recollection of the following dialogue;—
Lord C.: Well, this has been a crusher! I
wonder why Gascoigne and Bertie wouldn't come ?
Captain Terry; And Lord Copple ?
The Hon. Miss J. ( reproachfully ): Did not you
leave the key of the tide-board behind ?
Lord C. ( gloomily) ; In a moment of abstraction,
I own
LadyC.: Rash man! Do you not remember —-
Lord C. (sighing): Farewell our cherished Mar-
sala!— (yawning) : Where’s the freedom of the
City of the Plains, Terry ?
Captain T.: Oh, it’s with the heavy luggage in
the guard’s break.
Lovd C.: Thank Heaven!
Captain T.: I think it as well to mention that
after this trip I shall have no further opportunity
of waiting upon your Excellency. I have to be
married in six months’ time, to be sure; but look
at the time it will take me to get ready my clothes.
Lady C., the Hon. Miss J., Lord C : Yes;
Look at the time it will take him to get ready his
clothes!
Captain L.: The last drop of my life’s blood is
at the disposal of my Commandar-in-Chief—but—
Ale: We feel it! The wry last drop—
Captain L.: At the same time—
Hon. Miss H.: Naturally—
Lord C : Terry, I am down for Dubbo. Come
with me to Dubbo, and I release you.
LadyC. AND THE Hon. Miss H.: Oh, go with
him to Dubbo ?
Lord C. (weeping): Terry! have wo not donned
the same uniform ? Have we not, regardless of
surrounding danger, guarded Marble Arch to-
gether ? And would you thus desert me ? I im-
port aides by the half-dozen, but yet have none
available. A prey to mayors and town clerks, I
am almost undone. Against these evils armour
will not protect, nor valour avail me! I look to
outside aides to ward off these Thrusts Municipal.
Captain T.: Where is Dubbo ? You know how
I suffer on board.
Miss H : Why, Dubbo is by land!
Captain T.: You re-assure me! In that case I
will attend, your Excellency, with girded scimitar,
and matchlocks in my holsters.
All: Saved!

Press. But be not alarmed! There is plenty more

If Baron Bob is not about “ Jack ” con-
cerning his receptions at the various centres of the
colony, he has a vast deal more of patience con-
cealed within him than the peculiar expression of
his legs would seem to indicate. Expressive legs
arc among the characteristics of his Excellency t
and it is known to those who do know tlat
at Executive meetings their attitude is much con-
sidered. At Parramatta (where, if an angry man
kicks his heel hard into the ground, he unburies a
skull) Lord Robert got it badly. Where, how-
ever, he suffered most was at the School of Arts,
at which haven they got at him with an ode,
written by “ R. A. Withers, Isq.,” and which was
sung “to the tune of ‘ Rule Britannia,’” with a
brass-band accompaniment. One stanza of this
great production will be enough:—
" Not thine alone the welcome now—
Thou comest at our Queen’s behest;
To her great throno we fealty vow—
For ever be Victoria blest!
Hail, &c.”
Just a jingle—not querulous—but querying:—
0 Withers, can this, then, be thee
Who posed as Hisfry’s greatest, son.
Who braved the fiercest tempest’s sea
When “ Round the World in '81 ? ’
You ought to know a thing or two,
You’ve seen the Dmverse’s Rush,
You ought to know—and p’raps you do
This sort of thing is awful “slush.”
Think of the outfit they supplied—
A block-tm shirt not bought in vain
Socks of the peaceful bullock’s hide—
A wardrobe which cjme hick again !
What! thou ! Alf.’s pride of ail the bunch
Who’ve braved the Ocean's fairy scum—
Who’ve lought with Santiago punch,
And conquered Salt Lake City’s rum.
Descend to—No I thy flag’s yet furled I
Come down to “ fealty vow’—oh, scissors I*
No 1 someone else went “ Round the World ’—
This is another “ R, A. Withers.”
[* This is, indeed a poor, if not degraded rhyme.

OUR PROTEST.
O greaser, greasing- at thy wheel,
O stoker, stoking up thy Are,
•0 driver, with a nerve of steel,
O guard, whom servant girls admire,
Let no more jest and joking be
At M.L.A.’s who travel free.
They journey in their country’s cause;
It were not meet that they should pay,
Who ride about to make your laws—
And which of you shall dare to say
A member is a deadhead when
He doesn’t part, like other men ?
This world, remember, is a hive
Wherein are drones and working bees;
’Xis true the former often thrive
And live, on others’ toll, at ease—
Yet would you, in contemptuous tones,
Refer to M.L.A.’s as drones,
Because the pigeon-holes they shun
And pass the barrier on the “ nod ” ?
They harder work than many a one
That struggles with the stubborn sod;
The mental strain those men endure
Is something awful, to be sure!
Thou flippant, scoffing booking-clerk I
Thy shafts of wit no more must fly.
We’ve often heard thy rude remark
Of “ deadhead,” when there hurried by
Some senator to catch the train,
With rolling eye and weary brain.
“DeadheadI” forsooth, an idle gibe
At patriots who slave and sweat.
Who scorn the mention of a bribe
And never knew dishonour yet—
Whose proudest boast, remember, is
They never ride, except on hiz.
O greaser, if you’d keep your berth.
And stoker, driver, porter, guard,
Be careful that you kiss the earth,
In token of sincere regard,
Whene’er you on the platform see
An M.L.A.—as travels free.
INNOCENCE LOST.
Sally and Poll, two maidens o’er whose head
But eighteen golden summers yet had passed,
Loved liberty and healthful woodland life.
The cold restraints of hollow social laws.
The prim proprieties (of shrinking shame begot)
Were to young Sally hateful, and to Poll ;
For they had been to Sabbath-class and learned
How, ere an apple was by Eve devoured,
There was no shame, and none were bid to bend
Before that throne whereon Queen Fashion sits.
And Sally in the lightness of her heart thus spake:
“ Oh I Pol), thou sharer of my every joy,
Let us together some fair Eden seek
Down by the margin of that sacred stream
Which dark-skinned warriors in the happier days,
Ere white men with their Bibles and their beer
Their guns and garments, came to banish peace—
The Yarra Yarra named. Oh, let us thither roam
And live as lived the mother of the world,
Unheedful of the city’s mundane modes,
And clad in nought, save innocence and smiles.”
Then went they down, the dimpled hand cf Poll
Tight clasped within young Sally’s loving grasp;
And when they found a dewy, cool retreat,
(For long the sun had gathered in his rays)
The maidens east, with hasty hand aside
All garments, and stood bare before the moon
Which smiled a pale approval on the sight.
The gentle zephyrs held their wanton breaths,
The song of birds was hushed upon the trees.
And e’en the jackass stayed his thoughtless laugh,
And gazed, in courteous silence, at the twain.
Hither and thither flitted those fair maids,
Like fairies tripped they o’er the yielding sward,
Nor dreamed of evil. But, alas I there came
With ponderous step along the river side
Policeman X, and when his drowsy eye
Was sated with the visions it beheld
He bade the damsels once again be clothed
And “ Come Along.” With burning cheeks they
went,
And stately mien; a cloud came o’er the moon
To hide her faoa that she might not behold
These martyrs to the sinful thoughts of man.
Then Sally, drawing near to Poll, began:
“ ’Tis hard that we must wear again the robes
Of sin and shame, when we had cast them off,
An,d thought to live as best beseems our minds,
Can innocence with white men no more dwell ?
I fear mo not. But, Sally, when we’ve done
The little bit which tyranny ordains—
Ay, when our time is up and we are free—
Then, then, my child, we’il seek some distant isle
Where Nature rules and ‘ coppers ’ wield no sway*
There none shall babble of indecency, or cry
* Fie I Fie I’ upon us; in those better lands
’Twere only shame to know this thing called
shame—
A phantom sickly, conjured but to curse
The guilty minds of garment-wearing fools.”

A orioket match, which caused some little
Interest, was played at Victoria Barracks between
the Army and Navy on Tuesday, 6th. A large and
fashionable company was present including—many
ladies, Admirai Tryon, Mr. Wellington (private
secretary to his Excellency), Captain Milward,
Mr. Allison, Captain Petre, and a number of naval
'Officers. Tea and coffee were partaken of in the
mess-room at 5 o’clock. The band of the Per-
manent Artillery played selections during the
afternoon.

Farm Cove is quite empty again, only the

no less than seven man-of-war ships left the bar-
hour, the Miranda, Opal, Swinger, Raven, Harrier,

A ball given by the officers of the Diamond
in Hobart was not au unqualified success. The
guests were so few that they felt lonely in the
Town Hall, and the refreshments provided were
so decidedly “cheap and nasty” as to suggest
cheeseparing economy on the part of the hosts.
Possibly detention in quarantine had a depressing

Sydney, Wednesday.
My dear Belle,— Last week Lord and Lady
Carington delighted the Bathurst people by
spending: a few days In their little city. They
were, as a matter of course, banqueted, filed, and
generally made much of by the enraptured towns-
folk. and returned to Sydney by special train on
Saturday night. On Monday they started for
Newcastle.
We are having rather lively discussions here just
now aboqt Sir Alfred Stephen’s proposal to enact
a new Divorce Law. Sir Alfred, you know,
doesn’t see why a woman who has unwittingly
married a man, who is either a confirmed and in-
sane drunkard or brutal tyrant, should be doomed
to a life of misery. He thinks that in supb cases a
divorce should be granted, but Dr. Barry, the
Anglican Primate, holds different views. He says
the marriage tie should always be sacred, and if a
man and woman have made a mistake they should
take tbe consequences. Ned tells me the Cathedral
was crowded last Sunday night, when the Bishop
dhose this subject for his sermon, which shows
what a very interesting topic marriage is. We
are now wondering who will win the day—the
Primate or Sir Alfred Stephen. I daren’t tell you
whose side I take in case I might shock you; but,
then, now you can guess, can’t you ?
An Auckland paper, remarking upon the “ pro-
verbial beauty of the Auckland girls I suppose
the proverb fs current, in Auckland—says that
** Perhaps in ages to come, some dusky nation of
tbe coral isles and orange groves of the Polynesian
sea yet may play the same part in New Zealand
history as the Romans did of old when they sold
the lndeed, the beauty of our
women might well tempt St. Kevin or St. Anthony,
who, it will be remembered, were Cupid-proof.
Just imagine,” continues the Auckland man,
“the sensation of a Parnell, a Ponsonby. or a
Remeura belle on being appropriated by a dark-
skinned warrior of the Cakobau typel” The
poor editor fears that the South Sea blackfellows
may yet steal ail the Auckland woman. However,
he needn’t be afraid of the whites.
Signor Yittorini’s concert came off last Wednes-
day night, although it cuts me to tbe heart, 1
am forced to confess that the audience was neither
large, fashionable, nor enthusiastic. Two of the
principal artists, whose names were down on the
programme—Madame Kellermann and Mr. F.
Brewer—were absent on account of neuralgia and
sore throat respectively, and the one novelty held
out to tempt people was but a sorry affair after all.
I allude to the mandolin solo. It is an ineffective
instrument, which may have gone down well
enough a few centuries ago, but us long as we can
get musical boxes, we shall never want the mando-
lin. Signor Letigia, a new arrival, was the man-
dollnist, and, perhaps, made the very best of the
instrument. I have heard Signora Fabris in better
voice, and Mies Glendennlng also, but Mr. .Alpress
played capitally. Signor Vittorlni sang two solos
and a duet, but, although his voice is plentiful
enough, he isn't a successful vocalist, somehow. I
think it’s quality of voice that is wanting. And I
don’t think it's advisable for him to attempt the
dramatic, especially on a cencert platform-it
doesn’t suit his style, and although his gestures
and facial expression amused us all, I am sure
that wasn’t the aignor’s Intention. If I mistake
not, he wished rather to enlist our admiration. I
must say the concert fell especially flat after that
of the Metropolitan Lledertafel on the previous
Monday, and 1 am just as sorry as can be to say it.
Graham’s semi-annual concert was being held
the Fame night in the Protestant Hall, and was, of
course, crowded, being an Invitation affair. The
ladies of the orchestra—twelve, I think—again
distinguished themselves in a laohlon, but they
attempt altogether too much. Mr, Graham Is a
well-known musical enthusiast, and spends more
than half his life training this band of nis, but for
all that he h s as yet failed to Impress upon the
instrumentalists the advisability of keeping time;
consequently almost all tneir renditions have a
decided go-as-you-please air. But the other night
hey looked so happy and well-satisfied with
temselves and the audience, which was oom-
p sed chiefly of friends of Mr. Graham, that
rc Hy nobody has any business to find fault.

vanishes, but the Tam O’Shaater hat has
flung itself nobly into the breach, to prove this
sentiment a base calumny. Never has anything
clung to San Francisco with such burr-like per-
sistency as this popular head-gear.” Well, if this
is so. I am sorry for the taste of the San Francisco
people, for, surely, a more unbecoming hat was
never mounted. It takes a really pretty face and
head to wear a Tam O Shanler with impunity.
The return cricket match between the Daily
Telegraph and Bulletin resulted in a victory
for the latter. It is rumoured that the stage
means to challenge the Press next, and that, I
suppose, will about finish the cricket season. The
“I B ®, base-ball match is to eventuate on the Ist
of May, and on the same night the players are to
have a big banquet in the Masonic Had, at which
the Governor has promised his presence.
Some one told me the other day that at the prin-
cipal West Bad milliners 5 o’clock tea is provided
for the fair customers, and I think it must be quite
nice to discuss tea, toast, and taste simultaneously.
These West End milliners are wise in their genera
tion. They have probably discovered that when a
lady has been shopping a couple of hours she be-
comes so fatigued that she not seldom leaves half
her shopping undone, whereas a cup of tea puts
her into a good humour at once, and she is then
good for a few more bonnets, at the very least.
She may, of course, promise to call round the
next day and complete her purchases, but these
enterprising people have, no doubt, proved by
experience that a bird in hand is worth two in
the bush hence the brilliant idea of the tea. One
of our big drapery firms here once spoke of
attaching a restaurant to their establishment for
the convenience of their customers, but, as yet, it
has come to nothing. What a boon it would
be to us should they eventually carry out the
plan!
Monsieur Kowalski proposes to give two high
class concerts in the beginning of May, and this
morning Mr. C. Huenerbein told me he intended
to inauguarate a series of concerts also, the first
to take place on Good Friday, in the Masonic Hall.
Miss Christian has promised to come over
from Melbourne to assist him with them and
I feel perfectly satisfied that in Mr. Hueaer-
bein 3 hands they will be really first-class affairs
The men are planning all kinds of amusement for
their own dear selves during the Bister holidays,
but as yet I hear of no arrangements for us, so
I suppose we shall have to stay at home, make
buns, and, worse still, eatthem. A p <rty
of gentlemen have chartered a steamer to take
them to Lord Howe’s Island, where they Intend to
stay about 10 days, and enjoy themselves to their
heart s content. I quite envy them this trip, only
I think they will find it rather dull without any of
us with them, don’t you ? And, now good-bve.

a position to answer your questions about the pro-
( posed new taxation. You may be certain, how-
ever, that the £3OO of income will be always de-
ducted from a man’s gross Income whether he
have £3lO or £3OOO a year, and only the remain ier
taxed, and also that the owner of land for which
he receives rent will not have to pay both taxes in
respect ot it. The land-tax will be levied on all
land held above the limit of £lOOO, but the value
for the purposes of taxation will not include any
houses or other Improvements on the land. Thus
a vacant block in the city will pay the same amount
as land of equal value and area adjoining it,
although the latter may carry a store worth
£40.000....“ C. Crawford”: What N.S.W. wants is

all notice of the significant anti-monarchical de-
monstrations referred to in The Bulletin’s
leader of this week ?....“ J. Henty Ray” (Goul.

Despite the special pleading of the Argus, Mr.
Copeland uttered strong common sense both In
his speech and in his admirable letter to the Syd-
ney D.T. of Tuesday. The Argus, like yourself,
thinks, in the words of John Lemoinne, that God
Almighty is an Englishman “James Edwards ";
We repeat that shipmasters and owners like Ger-
man seamen, because—melancholy fact I—they
are as a rule much more sober and amenable to
discipline than British merchant sailors. That’s
the whole question in a nutshell “R.J.W.”;
We think that now that Crooks and Wilson have
retired to gaol, some little attention should be
devoted by the bank shareholders to their easily-
gulled directors "C. Maxey”: Looks “fishy.’.
So does the fact that, although it is little more
than two years since the fabu'ously rich Mount
Morgan goldfield was proclaimed, yet the whole of
the documents and records relating to the first
taking up of the goldfield claims and leases have
mysteriously, and moat conveniently for certain
persons, disappeared from the Mines Department,
and cannot anywhere be found.
TAXIDERMY.
This name is from the Greek words, which signify
“ arrangment ” and “ skin,” so that the ancient
Greens, no doubt, regarded taxidermy as the
original skin game of the period. Taxidermy did
not flourish in the colonies prior to the year 1836.
At that time an Englishman named Skinner esta-
blished a museum and general repository for
upholstered beast. Since then the art has ad-
vanced quite rapidly. To taxiderm properly re-
quires a fine taste and close study of the subject
itself in life, akin to the requirements necessary
in order to succeed as a sculptor. I have seen
taxidermed animals that would not fool anybody.
I recall at this time especially a lion, stuffed after
death by a party who had not made this matter a
subject of close study. This lion was represented
in a crouching attitude with open jaws and red
gums. A s time passed on, and year succeeded year,
this lion continued to crouch, his tail became less
rampant and drooped like a hired man on a hot day,
his gums became lees fiery red, and his reddish
skin hung over his bones in a loose and distraught
manner, like an old robe thrown over the knees of
a vinegary old maid ; spiders spun their webs
across his dull white fangs; mice made their nests
in his abominable cavity; his glass eye became
hopelea ly strabLmuaed; and the moths left him
bald-headed on the stomach. He was a sad com-
mentary on the extremely transitory nature of all
things terrestrial and the hollowness of the stuffed
beast. I also had a stuffed bird for a long time,
which showed the cunning of the stuffer to a great
degree. It afforded me a great deal of unalloyed
pleasure, because I liked to get old hunters to look
at it and tell me what kind of a bird it was. They
did not generally agree. A bitter and acrimonious
fight grew out of a dlsouBBion,ln relation to this bird.
A man from Woolloomooloo named Lyons and a
party called soiled Murphy (since diseased) were
in my office one morning, Mr. Lyons, 0.K., and
Mr. Murphy, in his great specialty of drunk and
disorderly. I had just stepped aside to make a
cheque for £5O 000, when the attention of Soiled
Murphy was attracted to the bird. He said it was
a common “ diver with an abnormal head,” while
Lyons claimed it was a “ wanhoo.” The bird had
a duck's body, the head of an owl, and the feet of
an emu. These parts had beenadjusted with great
care and the tail loaded with lead, somehow, so
the head would not tip the bird up behind. With
this rara avis, to use a foreign term, I loved to
amuse and instruct old hunterls (who had been
hunting all their lives for a free drink), and the
public generally, that the Direct Import Boot Co.
have opened their place of business at 408 George-
street, corner Sydney Arcade, where they mean
to build up an immense business, to secure which
they sell a single pair df boots or shoes at whole-
sale prices. A large variety of first-class goods to
select from, and something the publi® have not
seen before. Remember, a single pair ac whole-
sale rates means a great saving. The Direct

Respite angry-looking weather last Satur-
day morning a large attendance showed up at
Rosehlll meeting in the afternoon. For the Hurdle
Race, Raven was in command approaching the
last jump, when The Agent, with the crusher of
13jt. 131 b., fairly wore him down and won a great
race by a length. The April Handicap fell an easy
victory for Fuse, who won from start to finish;
and Ellington, at 6 to 4 on, fairly ran away with
the Selling Plate. For Rosehill Handicap, Lancer,
Rapid, and All Gold were most asked for, but the
winner turned up in the unthought of—except to
a very select few—Galatea, who defeated Dagobert
by something over a length. Cerise and Blue run-
ning into a place. Lord William finished the day s
sport by winning the Wycombe Stakes from
Cerise and Blue by a short neck, Bravo third.
After Cerise and Blue’s gallant effort in the handi-
cap with 9st. up. it really seemed a pity to ask the
mare to carry silk in the last race.

The second of the best two out of three
matches between the Sao and Assegai came off on
Saturday last over the Manly course. A soldier s
wind was the order of the day, and the Sao proved
the victor by Imln. SSaeo., so the pair will meet
next Saturday for the final event over the outside
course. All things equal in gear and handling, we
believe the Sao to be the faster of the two, and we
fancy the test would bo a truer one were it “best
and best ”at the tillers. Were the doctor as good
a hand at the tiller as he is a thorough yachtsman
and lover of the sport, we would have very little
doubt with regard to the issue of next Saturday a
race, but, unfortunately for the reputation of the
Sao, he is not so. The Fitzhardlnge family demon-
strated what handling will do when they won
races out of number with the old Ixion; later on,
with the Adelphi; and more recently with the
jury-rigged Blectra.

Last season the M.R.C. had the field all to
themselves in the matter of their club-racing
skiff, taut there are now three skiffs in the harbour
which equal in speed, if they do not excel, the
notorious M.R.C. skiff of last season. The B.R C.
have now a flyer from the shed of Donnelly and
Bullivan; the Woolloomooloo Club have a craft
from the same builders, which, by all accounts,
should be even faster than the S.R C.’s, and the
latest addition to the Glebe R.C. fleet is from the
hands of Harry Floyd, a N.Z. builder, now located
at Donnelly's old shed, Glebe Point. She has a
regular wager-boat bottom, is finished and fitted
In first-class style, and, so far as appearances go,
should prove a flyer. Taking this skiff as a
criterion, Floyd is an acquisition to Sydney
builders, for, with a little wholesome competition,
clubs may not think it necessary to send to Mel-
bourne for their boats, as we understand the Uni-
versity is doing.

“ Professor ” Jackson took bis benefit at
Foley’s on Saturday evening, wnen, as we antici-
pated, his pupils put in a merry evening. Amongst
other sets-to O’Donnell showed some pretty play
with Moncur. Dan. Hickey showed some science
in his three exhibited rounds with the massively-
built Donoghue; and M’Carthy and Smith followed
with a ding-dong three rounds, Smith proving the
receiver-general, but only on sufferance, as we
understand he has a nasty habit of putting his
mantosleeo when “on the job.” Tom Taylor
and a heavy-weight then had a lively three
rounds, which were in favour of the heavy-
weight, who lacked “ kip,” but had a big say over
Taylor in the matter of reach and weight. The
benefleiaire , as we say in the Nooze, wound up the
proceedings with a punll, who, with a confidence
born in the knowledge that the “ Professor ”
would “go light," made play, and a lively three
rounds ensued. By the way, we notice that one
of the Sunday papers said the wrestling bout at
Jackson’s show did not prove very Interesting.
This is much to be wondered at, taking into con-
sideration the fact that the wrestling match down
on the programme did not come off,
•* * *
We understand that Jack Hall, the well-
known light-weight, has been matched to meet
Ted Seymour next Saturday night at Foley’s Hall,
In a Queensberry contest. Both scientific, quick
fighters, a first-rate display may be anticipated.
Champion Foley starts next Wednesday on a flying
trip to Brisbane.

The Sydney University cricketers had
quite a pleasant outing on Saturday last, when
they journeyed to Parramatta to meet the local
Alfreds. The Parramatta men went to the wickets
and stayed there the whole afternoon, making 345
runs for the loss of 4 wickets.

Notwithstanding the gush ladled out over
the Governor’s visit to Bathurst, we have not seen
it chronicled in any of the papers, Sydney or pro-
vincial, amongst their “ fashionable movements ”
the fact that Jack Hall, Jimmy Lawson, and the
two Powells were In the City of the Plains during
the late festive season. The quartette went up on
the show business, boxing amongst themselves,
and inviting any gentleman in the audience who
fancied himself at.the business to try a deal. Baron
Bob, of course, created a favourable impression
on the yokels, but Jimmy Lawson created an im-
pression on some of them that will be green—and
black—when Baron Bob is again hob-nobbing with
the gay young Bertie.

The return match between teams from the
offices of The Bulletin and Daily Telegraph
resulted in a win for ttfe former, for whom Mr.
W. H. Traill topscored with 33 runs, Flick being
next with 33 in one innings and 17 in the other,
andT.Traiil and Flick shared the bowling honours
for the same team. Mr. Shepherd made 49 for the
Telegraph, J. Jones being next with 15. Several
alleged bats on both sides proved the pen to be
mightier than the cricket-bat, by scoring the in-
glorious “ duck.”

The Yankee papers appear to be under a
misapprehension with regard to Richard Mathews,
the boxer. A N.Y. journal says he defeated every
fighter he met in Australia; but, as a matter of
tact, he thought fit to leave Australian boxers
alone (except when Peter Jackson knocked him
out in a trial set-to), and confined his attention to
New Zealand bruisers. On February 36 he en-
gaged ,n his first-glove fight since his return to the
States, when he met, at ’Frisco, a heavy-weight
named Lange. Lange la a rushing fighter, and
stood no show with Mathews, who countered
heavily and knocked him out in six rounds, much
to the disgust of the onlookers, who thought Lange
could have made a longer thing of it had he not
shown the white feather. Mathews is now matched
to fight Jack Brady for “the championship of the
Pacific Coast and a purse of £100,” to come off in
Private, with hard gloves.

little I have seen and heard, I do not believe in
the face of the past blameless record that you can
show, second to none in the world, that a single
impartial Australian is to be found who will credit
the baseless and lying assertions so unmanly and
despicably hurled at a man of your uncommon
and rare character. It fulfils the old saying of
“My greatest sin is failure.” Dear sir, I have
been steadfastly, even before your renowned
match with Trlckett in 1880, one of your earliest
Australian admirers and ardent supporters, and
have had many a hard-worded argument in your
favour, and I am happy to say that a few of for-
tune’s frowns will not suffice to turn my back on
one of such rare talent and nature as you are
possessed of. In conclusion, hoping I have not in-
truded upon your privacy, or reminded you of un-
pleasant things, I may say that, though not a
single person in Australia felt your defeat by
Beach more keenly than I did, still I live in the
hope of seeing you one© more champion —I am,
yours, &c., James MTntosh.’ ” What a pretty
little letter the confiding Mr. M'lntosh indites I
The “dear sir” jls lovely, and as to the “hope”
expressed by the ingenuous James that he has not
intruded upon the aristocratic privacy of the inno-
cent and dove-like Mr. Edward Hanlan—why, it
makes us feel at once that the ex-champion’s
sympathetic correspondent ought to be a member
of the S.M. Herald staff.

“The recent Murrurundi racing meet does
not appear to have given that proverbial “plea-
sure to all ” which constitutes the bulk of the
Market s reet millennium. The jockey Tory was
accused of riding the mare Beatrix With a “ heavy
rein” so as to let Blue Gown scoop the pool, but
the trick appears to have been clumsily performed
as the pair made a dead heat of the run home.
The result was Mr. Tory received a wigging
(country-fed humour this), and was also treated to
a 13 months’ disqualification in which the mare
joins. Touching the settling, the Murrurundi and
Quirindi Times pen-jost!er appears to be baoly
gravelled, as ho bitterly complains that, though
“ over 300 sovs. were distributed amongst six win-
ners, on Thursday night, only £3 was thrown in
for the customary ‘ flz.’ All lovers of sport will
regret the absence of the true sporting spirit on
this occasion, but perhaps the determination of
the stewards to punish all swindlers was the cause
of the winners’ refusal to ‘part’ with anything
like generosity.” Only £3 worth of the true
sporting spirit among so many! No wonder the
Times tipster howled,

Neil Matterson wrote the Yankee papers
that it was his intention to visit America and row
Hanlan, Teemer, or any man they can raise. By
cable we learn that Matterson has challenged
Beach for a second shy for the championship, and
that Mr. Edward Hanlan has also thrown out a
deft for a £5OO match on the Thames.

English papers announce the death of W.
Perkins, regarded as the fastest walker who ever
yet put on shoes. In contrast to the majority of
walkers, so-called, Perkins was an undeniably fair
heel-and-toe man, and his style was particularly
taking. He was but a shooting star in the heavens
of pedestrianlsm, and can hardly be said to have
adorned his profession from a social point of view.
Of late years Perkins—fat and knocked out-
picked up a precarious living about racecourses.
• * *
It was in 1824 that America first raised a
trotter to cover a mile in 3mia. 40sec. In the mean-
time, by improved breeding and trainieg, they
have knocked off something over half a minute.

England has at last got, in Smith, Green-
field’s victor, a pugilist who may worthily face
Bullivan, with whom Smith s supporters are will-
ing to make a match for £3OOO, In one band te
can be backed for £3OOO, and in another for £lOOO,
so that the Yankee will have no cause to grumble
at the poverty of the stakes. A timher-porter by
trade. Smith is one of the most poweriully-built
men yet seen. He is beautifully made from head
to heel, big enough to compete with any man, but
in no way clumsy. He is a terrific hitter, and has
good science, and to thesa qualities may be added
the possession of a good temper. Furthermore,
he can stand any amount of punishment, and takes
his gruel without the semblance of flinching.
Smith who is but 33 years of ago, weighs l3st. 11 b.
in condition. So that we may soon have a repeti-
tion of the great Sayers- Heenan contest.

Here’s an official chunk from the sweet
memories of the golden past:—“New South Wales,
Bathurst, to wit.—Eliza Elizabeth Brooks, per
ship Mary, 7 years, 1836, brought before the court,
charged with drunkenness and absconding. Mr.
George Kable, being sworn, saith:— ‘ The prisoner

Supert. Police; Gko. Hanken, J.P. t’ontence: To
be confined in the cells on bread and water for It
days, head shaved, aad to be returned to Govern-
ment.” ‘‘Head shaved,” eh 1 Tre Solons of our
early days knew how to make Eliza ait up.
We (that is to say the Australian public)
may all be in gaol one day. It is ss well, there-
fore, to know howto sleep on bare boards. The
weight of your body rests enllrely upon your
shoulders and hip joints. Wrap, therefore, a coat
around your shoulders, another garment around
your loins, put your waistcoat in your hat for a
pillow, and you will be able to sleep without
waking at midnight with aching bones. This
advice should especially interest the clergy, who
mostly wear soft bate.
If a prize for high- class imbecility were
offered it would tiT won hands-down by
someone In the Sydney Public IJbrart. In
the annual report of the Reference Branch,
the sapient trustees carefully note that “ the
books stolen are not costly, and of no parti-
cular interest, and they appear to have been taken
for private use by young persons of short experi-
ence and low principle to help in their business or
profession.” Dogberry himself couldn’t improve
upon thejforegoing. If the books referred to are
of no particular interest, why in thunder were
they selected at the public expense for the Refer-
ence Library ? And, unless the young persons of
short experience happened to be in the fried-fish,
or hot-saveloy line, of what earthly use could
such works be to help them In their business or
profession ?
The dear old Dean of Melbourne—long
life to him!—has sent his archdeacons a letter on
the subject of prayer for rain. The departed
Biahop.lt will bi remembered, held an opin’on
that the Almighty didn’t bkseto be bothered about
these matters, and was, in a general way, loth to
interfere in the arrangements of the universe.
Now the Dean, fully persuaded that you can get
anything by onlr praying hard enough for it, is
yet mindful of the fact that a colonial diocese
covers a good deal of grouad. There are places,
says the Dean, where rain has been superabundant,
and as it seems rough that a parson, whose kitchen
Garden is already half-tlooded, should be requested
o ask the Loard for an extra supply of his bountiful
showers, the Dean thinks “ it is better on the pre-
sent occasion that the clergy be *ulded by their
own judgment, rather than that they should re-
ceive any general directions on the subject.” This
wl]l take a weight off the minds of those lucky
divines whose small cabbages are already coming
on nicely. .
A “Jfew Chum Lady” writes us:—“Editor
BkrpLKTiM,— Two things puzzle me much In
Sydney, and they are—firstly, the fact that In
tolerably decent-looking suburban streets, where
rents are dear, many of the inhabitants shame-
lessly hang out towels, and so on, to dry on their
balcony-railings; and, secondly, the queer habits
of the restauoant authorities. The other after-
noon at about 3 o’c’ock, I went into a very
swagger eatlng-piace to appease the cravings of
the inner woman, and found that there wasn’t a
soul In the big room except a well-dressed and
well-nourished attendant, who, as I entered, was
oalmly scratching his whiskers—and his spinal
column—with a long ham-knife taken from the
buffet, whereon reposed the mid-day viands of the
establishment. What can one do with such
people?” [Go out, madam, murmuring, “God
bless the Duse of Argyll.”— Ed. B.]
At Monaco has just died Major Murray,
who, a quarter of a century ago was, as a hero of
melodrama, the nine days' wonder of London,
He fought with a bill-broker In Northumberland-
street, not for his money, but for his life, the best
part of a morning. His adversary Invited him to
his lodgings on pretence of business, and shot him
with a pistol (not a revolver) through the neck.
The bill-broker was a jealous rival of his. without
the major's knowledge. He thought he hid done
for him, but the major, “ tough ” as Joey 8., re-
vived, and went for him. They fought with every-
thing that they could lay their bands upon; but
at last the bill-broker was finished off by a botWe
of champagne administered externally. What a
rough-and-tumble It muet have been I The room
was described as “ swimming in blood.” And all

murder, but, of course, acquitted.
The Irish financial grievance. In 1841, the
Imperial revenue raised In Ireland, with a popu-
lation of nearly nice millions, was £3 907,338. The
Irish revenue raised in 1881 with a population of
five millions, was to £7,733,000. In 1841 the inci-
dence of taxation per head of population was 9j.
61.; in 1851 it was 13i. 61.; in 1861 it had risen to
£l3s. Id.; while in 1871 it had been forced up to
its present figure, £l6a 34. Thus, in 30 years, the
Imperial taxation of Ireland Increased nearly 350 per
eent., the population having. In th© same period,
fallen nearly 35 per cent. But in England, during
the corresponding period, Imperial taxation only
Increased about 17 per cent, which was so far lea*
than the increase of population that taxation was
3s 3d. per head less in Great Britain in 1881 than in
1861. In England the duty on the popular bever-
age, beer, has been reduced to less than what it
stood at before 1853; In Ireland the duty on the
popular beverage, whisky, has been increased
fourfold.

Carnrick’s Cod Liver Oil &
PEPTONISED (DIGESTED.)
Highly recommended by the Medical Profession throughout the world as being
the best remedy for Coughs, Colds, Bronchitis, Scrofula, Wasting
Diseases, Consumption, General Debility, over-taxed brains, &c., &c.
It will produce an immediate gain in flesh and strength.
Can be taken when all other forms of Cod Liver Oil aro refused.
It contains about equal parts of the best Norwegian Cod Liver Oil and concen-
trated fresh milk, both peptonised (digested).
The peptonised milk disguises the unpleasant taste and smell of the oil. and
makes it as sweat as cream; very palatable and most nouris h ing.
Invaluable for children, and will agree with the most delicate persons, causing
no return or unpleasantness.
One trial will satisfy anyone of the great value of this new and unique pre-
paration.
The 1 reconstructive or nutritive properties are five times greater than the
plain oil or any Other Emulsion, hence it is much cheaper.
Both the Oil and the Milk being digested, the whole will assimilate, whereas
in Cod Liver Oil and other Emulsions (being undigested) only a small
proportion is of any value. It is the most nerfect Emulsion ever
made, and the only One of digested Cod Liver Oil and Milk.
Analysed and recommended by the first Professors in Europe.
We also manufacture the above preparation combined with Hypophosphitea
of Lime and Soda. SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS.

Important to Mothers Mums
Oarnrick’s Soluble Food for Infants, Invalids,
and Aged Persons, is the most nutritious, palatable, and easily-digested Infant’s
Food ever manufactured, containing fifty per cent, of thesolids of milk (digested),
and fifty per cent, of the finest wheat, converted into soluble form.
A most perfect food. The nearest approach to Mother’s Milk ever made.
It is unequalled for the formation of fat, flesh, and bone, and increasing
the vital forces SO necessary to health.
Specially recommended in cases of Marasmus, Diarrhoea, and Cholera
Infantum, and where the digestion is defective.
Children fed upon cereals or cow’s milk, alone very often remain weak, and
suffer from softening of the bones, and when attacked by infantile dis-
orders are unable to resist the inroads of disease.
“OARNRICK’S SOLUBLE FOOD" is invaluable for Invalids
and Aged Persons (who cannot digest farinaceous food), as it is rich
in nutritive and easily-digested albumenoids, thus increasing both flesh
and strength, and restoring the vital forces.
It is most convenient fo - use,being in a powdered form, and will keep indefinitely.
When boiled and stirred for three minutes it is ready for immediate use.

ROWLANDS’ OCONTO is the best, purest

Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness of the teeth and their freedom from

as a pure and non gri ty tooth powder; such
Rowlands’ Odonto has always proved itself to be.

Fkw people are aware of the alarming prevalence of
Kidney and Liver diseases, especially among those who
have arrived at or are past middle age. It is declared
on good authority that fully one-half the deathssn
this country are either directly or indirectly the
result of Kidney or Liver disease of some sort.
A great majority of men above 40 years of age are
afflicted with some sort of affection of the Kidneys or
Bladder, and these diseases are on the increase. Per-
sons are often seriously affected before they kpow of
it themselves, and thus these insidious disorders get a
good foothold before anything is done to dislodge
them.
Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, Bright’s Disease, Incon-
tinence, Debility, Catarrh of the Bladder, Albu-
menuria, are among the many forms of these
diseases. Most of these are very difficult to cure,
defying the powers oftentimes of the best physicians
obtainable, and are pronounced by many to be
incurable.
Physicians state that many forms of Kidney and
Liver disease are very difficult to detect, as in diseases
of this form oftentimes there are no symptoms of a
marked nature. This is one of the reasons why they
are so difficult to cure.
Dr. BELL’S (Kidney and Liver Bitters) is a Specific
for Kidney and Liver troubles, Bladder and Urinal
Diseases, Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, and all of that
class of disorders.
It cures Biliousness, Headache, Jaundice, Lirer
and Stomach troubles, Dyspepsia, Constipation, and
Piles.
It cures Intemperance, Nervous Diseases, General
Debility, Female Weaknesses and Excesses.
It is thoroughly reliable, highly recommended,

THERE are many men in this eolony who are,
day by day, melancholy, miserable, and a
burden to themselves, through early indiscretion
or over-indulgence. It is to those that this adver-
tisement is addressed. Impotence drags its victim
in its unhappy train through years of suffering,
rendering his existence a misery. He sees his
fellow beings hale, hearty, and vigorous—in the
full enjoyment of manhood’s greatest privilege—
and naturally becomes despondent, seeking soli-
tariness, and shunning society generally.
He is lured into trying some of the S«-called
Remedies, but without avail, and imagines he
must go down to the grave a hopeless invalid. If
such be your calamity, know that your case ean
be relieved and a Cure effected by a simple course
of this invaluable Medicine, which will, in the
short space of Four Weeks, render you capable
of appreciating and Knloylng Life.
This valuable remedy affords relief,and perma-
nently cures all who suffer from wasting and
Withering of the Nervous and Muscular Tissues,
Spermatorrhoea, and all Urinary Deposits, which
cause incapacity and degeneracy, total and partial
prostration, and every other exhaustive derange-
ment of the system—regenerating all the im-
portant elements of the human frame, and en-
abling man to fulfil his most sacred obligations.
The directions are very simple, and require no
restraint or hindrance from business. Pamphlets
enclosed in each case with testimonials.

DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED.
Even if you have tried many remedies for your
kidney disease or liver complaint without success
it is no reason why you should think your disorder
incurable. The most intractable casts readily yield
co the potent virtues of Dr. Bell’s Bitters. It is a
purely vegetable compound, which acts on the
kidneys, liver and bowels at the same time, and
thus cleanses the whole system. Don’t wait, but
get a bottle to-day and cure yourself.*

to do so. The consequence was that he was fre-
quently overlooked. One day his father said,

plate, pa; it is clean;” and he added, with a sigh,
‘‘there has not been anything on it yet.”—

MUCH STRANGER STORIES.
Magna veritas eat et prevalent.
For the idea of this column we are indebted to
the Sydney Echo, a penny paper, which contains
much Interesting and original matter in the
advertisement columns, and selected fiction,
which Is usually to be found under the
head of “ Cablegrams-From our Special Cor-
respondent.” With a view of galvanising the
paper to some extent, a page has been recently
devoted to “Strange Stories” written by occasional
contributors and warranted by them as correct.
With grateful alacrity we adopt the idea. Contri-
butions forwarded to this paper for insertion in
the “ Much Stranger Stories ” column, must, in
aecordance with the Echo rule, bear the signa"
ture and address of the writer, a copy of his bap"
tlsmal certificate—and his receipt for last year’s
water-rates should be attached to the screed, which
latter must be attested by a sober church-warden
0 r a respectable justice of the peace. Of the
stories received to date In accordance with these
conditions we select as first in point of merit.
Sh«ba Slumkins was at once my rapture and
my ruin. Sire was one of twins—a boy and a girl.
They broke the news to her father gradually,
telling him of his daughter first. W hen he heard of
the son he said the girl should be called “Sheba,”
because “ the half was not held him.” I first met
her at a hall held in tbe woolshed of Fer-
tile Plains Station. The station was called by
that name because the cows, aided by the brand-
ing-irons, were said to average three calves each
yearly. Strangely enough, the adjoining runs could
only muster an average of one calf to four cows
at branding time. I was in search of a wife when
t Slieba, for it seemed to me that a strong
woman and a mangle could earn a lot of money in
Gornbungyah at that time. As we danced I
noticed that her .arms were suited to such light
labours. So were her hands. Further, I observed
that she wore a very short dress, a proof of her
economy, and at supper, by pocketing three
custard tarts and a jelly, she convinced me that
■he was able to look out for her herself. My love
was not of a mercenary order. I loved her for
herself alone—especially her arms. But her
father was perverse and censorious. He sprang
the mangle-racket on me, and said that such work
was beneath the dignity of the daughter of the
bellman of Gornbungyah. I pleaded the high posi-
tion my father had achieved (he was night-watch-
man in a Fire Brigade Tower), but this did not
move him. It was I that had to move. With my
usual readiness to oblige, I moved with alacrity,
the belhnan waving adieu with his copper-toed
number nineteens as I crossed the threshold. But
my triumph was planned. Sheba was fond of
Kangarooln’ (and also of blue-rooin—gin you
know), our usual amusement on Sunday when
there was no service at the churches. We would
meet in the hunt, and then elope I We went. About
midday an enormous doe kangaroo, with a big
young one in her pouch, started just ahead of our
party. I was riding a big horse which I called
Silverscrip, because he used to fall sometimes
very suddenly, and rise again very slowly. He
was very fresh, so was Sheba, (she carried rum,)
and we had purposely been reserving our horses
for the opportunity. Soon we left the others far
behind, but still sped on side by side in pursuit of
the marsupial. Suddenly Sheba uttered a more
forcible than eloquent monosyllable, and her
bridle hung loose from the choke-strap down.
(The choke-strap generally hang?, or at least it did
so with the immediate ancestors of some of our
first families ) “ What’s up?” I enquired, with the
brevity the situation demanded; “Has your bit
come in half?” “You bet,” was her reply, “come
in half, aad yet doubled, for it is now two bits.”
There was too much gravity in our situation to
admit of such levity, for her horse had bolted, and
she stood, or to speak more accurately sat, in im-
minent danger of losing her head in ointact with
a tree, for the horse had now completely got his.
As his bridle had broken he seemed determined to
prevent ours. To secure her safety I tried a plan
recommended in Vanity Fair for adoption in a
similar case. Riding close along the bolting horse
I tried to place my left arm in the dear old fashion
round Sheba’s waist. It must have been the jolt-
ing that did it, for Instead of gripping her as
Intended my arm seems to have gone
round the horse where the girths are siung,
so that when I tried to lift my heart’s
delight (as directed by the Vanity Fair
man) on to my saddle, I lifted her horse up as well•
This mistake complicated matters somewhat. I
could not let her horse fall without dropping
Sheba as well, and to guide my steed and keep the
double burden steady was a task almost beyond
my power. It wearied me to do it Silverscrip
finally precipitated affairs by falling down. We
all fell in a heap - Sheba first, then the two horses,
and myself on top of the pile. I had no time to
sort them out, for the enraged kangaroo, hav-
ing killed the dogs, was coming towards us with
terrific leaps, and an apparent determination to
do damage to someone. Hastily putting Sheba’s
watoh, loose change, and flask in my pocket, I
prepared to s.ll my life to the kangaroo at the
highest possible price, terms cash, in consequence
of the owner departing for another land. But
here again my presence of mind stood me In good
stead. I noticed that my assailant had thrown out
her young one. This was my salvation. As the
huge beast rose for the last jump towards me, I
rose too; we met in the air, and I, in accordance
with my pre-arranged plan, Jumped into her pouch I
She was euchred, and 1 scored for a march. In
this singular position I lived for several days.
My foster-mother seemed to take to me kindly
enough and supplied me with abundance of food_
But I rapidly grew weary of milk diet, more espe-
cially as there never was any rum in it, and so took
an early opportunity of escaping. After some
trouble I regained the horses and started with
them for the Queensland border. Sheba was dead,
why should Igo back to Gornbungyah ? No, I
would go away from everything that reminded me
of a vanished vision of bliss. Plunged in an abyss
of sorrowful memories I forgot to send back the
bellman’s horse, and this little oversight was the
cause of my arrest as I was speeding from my sor-
row, and N.S.W. lam almost ashamed to confess
that men were less kind to me than the brutes had
been. “ Man’s inhumanity to man make countless
thousands ”go to gaol. That’s where they put
me, charged with the murder of Sheba, the
theft of her change, ditto of the bellman’s
horse, and several other crimes which do
not at present occur to me. I told the
jury my story, but the newspapers reported
“laughter,” and “continued laughter” after
every sentence of my defence. I tried to show the
judge how the accident happened, but he only
laughed. I told him how I had lived on the
kangaroo, and with brutal wit he said that he bad
understood from the prosecution that I had only
been “on the wallaby.” Then I told the court that I
had omitted to return to Gornbungyah, in the for-
getfulness of grief, and that the reason of my
travelling by night was that I dreaded snakes—
“ and green dogs and blue devils, too, I suppose ’*
said the wholesome-fun man with the long wig.
Then they found me guilty on all the charges, and
sentenced me to be hanged and to suffer 137 years
imprisonment and two floggings. Ido not think it
likely that I shall last out my sentence.
P.S.—I was hung last week; there was nothing
noteworthy about the ceremony. My story is a
sad one, my only consolation being that I leave
no one behind me who will trouble to sing my
epitaph in the Herald at sixpence a iine to the
tune of the time-honoured j'ngle, “Dearest Willie,
how we miss thee.” 1 am a bit lonesome here,
but some British army-contractors are expected
shortly. Farewell.

The Duke of Cambridge has delivered a
jeremiad as to the difficulty of getting a constant
supply of young officers for the military service.
The energy is dying out of England’s historic
nobility. Of yore, the eldest son being settled on
the paternal estate, the second marched bravely
into the service of the. God of War, and the third
(and if the first or second son of a coroneted dad
was not a fool, the third was bound to be one)
crept meekly into the service of the God of Peace.
Both services are now shunned. Both gods want
too much work for the noble scions of to-day. All
they are becoming lit for now is to iie back, fillip
their souls with absinthe, and wait for some Aus-
tralian or Yankee girl whose father made a mil-
lion out of tallow or wool to come along and marry
them for blood.
A Thargomindah (Q ) man, one Brown, got

man seized the bottle, took one gulp, and lay down

Extract from the letter of an aristocratic
English new-ohum now gaining colonial experi-
ence in the Cook Country, N.Q. “There Is no end
of sport up here. The bush is full of game; the
rivers are alive with ilsb, and the back country is
fairly swarming with niggers. The number of
carcases of the latter which are sold to the mill-
proprietors for engine-fuel is no criterion of the
number actually killed. Many people hunt them
just for the sake of the sport alone. We bagged
15 full grown males, seven gins, and half-a-dozen
picannies on Sunday last.” The Home Missionary
Society should secure that traveller on his return
to pious England. He’d fill Exeter Hall every
night for a month, and the coin would rattle into
the plates like hailstones on a bald head.
The Indian and Colonial Exhibition has
been the cause of waking the Calliope (Q.) gold-
field from a long deep slumber. Most of those
who dug the yellow metal from the coarse drift in
the once bustling little to wn of Gladstone went to
sleep soon after the Calliope was tucked in. They
will not awake, anyhow, until the Great Exhibi-
tion of all. This Is how Calliope was roused. The
commissioners wrote for specimens of auriferous
alluvial washdirt to Henry Friend, of Gladstone,
who at once set men to work in Nuggetty Gully,
an old abandoned spot. In sinking they came on
a nugget weighing and on a trial washing
a small quantity of dirt gave 7dwt. of coarse
shotty gold. The news brought diggers on horse-
back and fo„t. They tickled the ribs of the old
goldfield, and sang the songs of yore. But Cal-
liope turned over and went asleep again.
Mayor Young, of Sydney, has ordered
that any Corporation official whose salary is “at-
tached ”lato be dismissed. Should such an edict
be enforced in the Civil service also there’ll be a
greater reduction in the rank* than was ever
dreamt of even by the moat rabid advocate for
retrenchment. As a check to the borrowing pro-
pensities of our impecunious officials, however*
the proclamation is simply useless. Messrs.
Shkinemcioze Schuttdown and Co. will still find
the “ready,” but trek on another shixty per
shent for the “ extra risk.” In one department a
similar rule has been in force for the past year,
and is productive of the greatest good to the—
Chosen People. Mayor Young has the best of in-
tentions, no doubt, but he’s only finding additional
plunder for a set of hawks, one of whose number
—his name is a household word in Sydney—not
long since sold out a widow’s scanty furniture
while her husband was lying dead in their home.
“ Yolapuk,” the new “ universal lan-
guage,” which you can learn in half-a-dozen les-
sons, has already thousands of devotees. Last
summer representatives (from all European coun.
ties) of 30 Yolapuk societies, met in council at
Fredrichshaffen and voted the creation of an
academy. The new language is a clever, useful
discovery. Its founder, M. Schleyer, spent 30
years in evolving it, and the result is a marvel of
simplicity. But the latter quality could hardly be
looked for in a vocabulary borrowed from the
various European tongues. For instance, the
Yolapuk for wisdom is sap, from the Latin
s apere; people is pop, from populus; moon, mun,
from the English moon or the German mond;
meat, mat, from English meat, &c. The syntax is
comprised in four pages, and the following is an
llustration of the method of conjugating Yola-
puk verbs. The personal pronoun I, thou, he,
&c, being expressed by the words oib, 01, om;
plural, obs, ols, oms. We have for the present tense
of the verb tik, from the English think :—tikob, I
think; tikol, thou thinkest; tikom, he thinks;
tikobs, we think; tikols, you think; tikoms, they
think. By prefixing the vowels, a, e, i, o, u, we
have the different tenses thus:— Atikob, 1 thought,
etiltob, I have thought, &c. Adjectives follow the
noun, and adverbs the verb; there is no gender.
In a word, the fundamental rules can be acquired
in a few hours, and as to the vocabulary, all the
beginner requires is the Yolapuk dictionary
to his mother tongue, which is easy to get.
THROUGH PERILOUS PLACES:
A Tale of my Unnatural Life,
BY
MUNCHAUSEN HARPER,
I have read somewhere that fact is stranger than
fiction. Before half my story is told it will be seen
that fiction is stranger than fact. I have met
with many adventures, so much so that when I
asked the local bellman for his beautiful daughter,
he said I was a “ mere adventurer.” Often when
describing my perils ” at local
pubs, have asked me “if I was any way related
to Skuthorpe,” and quite recently one man came
up and shook hands with me when I had finished
my story, and said in an evidently sincere man-
ner, “ I like you, I do. Oh, yes, I like you, because
you are such a liar.” It was not the words
that I disliked, but I hate to hear a man put so
much emphasis on an adjective. It is a distinct dis
advantage to one to have so many marvellous
escapes as I have had. He must tell people about
them, and then sooner or later some malicious
person is bound to nip him, on the verdict of a
prejudiced jury, for perjury or something, as I—
but that is my story. I will begin at the beginning.
A mild Suggestion.

“ The lances for the use of the Sydney
Lancers have arrived from E gland.”— Daily
Paper.
At last our Lancers larcars are indeed,
Though base detractors still the title would
refuse them;
No longer they their proper weapons need,
They’ve got them, though perhaps they don’t
know how to use them.
And now that they’re so gorgeously arrayed
And in their dress resemble so their English
brothers,
Some effort to be like them should be made,
Not in the way of dress alone, but in some
others.
See Linsey Woolsey strutting through the town I
And look—the fellow cannot even strut erectly;
His legs are tying knots, his head bent down—
Surely he’ll come a cropper on his nose directly I
Fitz-Bullock’s smarter on his legs and feet,
And, being country-bred, can ride to admiration;
But can’t address a lady if they meet,
And lacks entirely any decent education.
One cannot speak three words without an oath,
Another never tempers drinking with discretion;
And of these gentlemanly habits, both
Enhance the charms of number three in the pro-
cession.
But they have gentlemen in word and deed,
Assailable by no stern critic’s just detraction;
Worthy a troop of gentlemen to lead.
Courteous in speech, obeying honour’s laws in
action.
Theirs is the type to teach our would-be swells
To cultivate the grace they may possess innately:
There is the lesson—they must learn it well
Before they claim the name they covet now so
greatly.
The most are not well-born; but never mind—
That doesn’t matter here, far from the old world’s
border,
And probably their pockets are not lined
So well as those ot England’s too-rich, favoured
order.
But they can be the equals of the best
Of these, if only they emblazon on their banners
(And keep the promise thus they make) a crest
Whose motto bears the words—“ Drill, Modesty—
and Manners.”
