Honours and Imperialism.
W&bn Sir Thomas MHlwraith visited
England during his first Premiership, he had
occasion, necessarily, to call at the Colonial
Office. Lord Carnarvon was at that time
Secretary of State for the Colonies, and held,
metaphorically speaking, the fate of these
communities in the hollow of his hand. Since
that time his Lordship has favoured us with
a visit and the people of the colony, or at
least some of them, have had an opportunity
of learning with a certain degree of direct-
ness what sort of a man had been their
special Providence. Sir Thomas MHlwraith
had anticipated the later Impressions thus
formed. He had among his familiar friends
made no secret of his valuation. Reduced
to the vernacular of the vulgar, his descrip-
tlon of the Imperial magnate may be rendered
as “a confounded old woman.” Now Lord
Carnarvon was but one among a long series
of Secretaries of State for the Colonies all
selected on the same “ principle,” and gene-
rally with identical results. The “principle”
has been a simple one. So many seats in
the Cabinets to be filled : so many aspirants
who must be provided with seats. Buff?
and Snuffy being provided for, what remains
for Guffy ? Shove him into the Colonial
Office I
• • •
It would be absurd to pretend that—other
things being ei}uaU—it should not be possible
to pick from 35,000,000 of inhabitants bf
Great Britain a Cabinet collection which
should, man for man, be superior to any
Ministries which could be got togetheh in
the Australias with their 3,000,000 or so of
people. And it has to be admitted that,
although “ other things ” are not equal, the
inequality is not all favourable to the one
side. Thus if it be an advantage to be able
to draw upon a leisured class of highly-
educated persons, of independent means,
for Parliamentary rulers, the mother country
is all ahead. But if it be an advantage to
have the biggest pick of men of simply
natural parts and shrewdness, the balance
seems rather to incline in the opposite direc-
tion. Parliamentary representation in Great
Britain has been, and still is, ah almost
exclusive privilege of one or two classes.
In Australia lb is open to every class. Thus
it may be that the scope for choice is about
numerically equal after all in Australia and in
England. A University training and an Indoc-
trhlation in the fads of traditional officialdom
do not necessarily confer upon the typical
trained aspirant for legislative fiinctions in
Great Britain, any qualifications of practical
value. And the possession of redundant
wealth, Inherited or acquired, does not carry
with it intellectual aptitude for administra-
tive functions.
* * *
It follows that, despite the occasional
prominence achieved in British politics by
men of exceptional gifts added to accidental
accomplishments, the colonial legislatures
have been on the average constituted of men
quite as capable of attending to the concerns
to be dealt with as have been the Parliaments
of the mother country. The accomplish-
ments, in fact, of a Canning, a Burke, a
Gladstone, or of the late Earl Derby, serve
chiefly to embellish the solid parts and
to Illuminate the gifts which such men
derived from nature. The instance of
Benjamin Disraeli supports this pro-
position. Possessed of little Latin and less
Greek • unable to converse in French, the
language of diplomacy, his natural gifts made
him the real, although nob the nominal, chief
of Lord Derby, author of a translation of
the Iliad, and enabled him to hold his own
on equal terms with Gladstone, a man dis-
tinguished among the schoolmen of any age.
It does not happen very often that an Aus-
tralian Parliament touches the depths of in-
competency which has been bottomed by the
present Legislature of New South Wales.
Our annals present no Instance of a Cabinet
which would not compare favourably with
one which comprises a Roberts, an Abigail,
an Indus, and a Simpson. But no matter
what intellectual strength might be em-
bodied in Australian Parliaments, the future
of these regions would be compromised were
it not for the happy fatuousness of the rulers
of the mother country.
* * •
There is no possibility of misconceiving
the divergent tendency of policies in Great
Britain and in Australia with respect to the
future relations of the two countries. Tardily
but surely the rulers of the mother country
are awakening to the enormous value of the
vast continent which was once scorned as a
worthless desert. It has dawned at length
upon the ruling classes that while they and
their forefathers have been pouring out
blood and treasure immeasurable to preserve
some Inscrutable balance of power in Europe,
a territory which can never be English,
there is here, at the Antipodes, a con-
tinent equal in area and superior in poten-
tialities which is nominally all their own,
and may, by adroit management, be
retained as an appanage of the Crown. The
floundering fashion in which it is attempted
to regain or retain dominion in Australia is
infinitely diverting. Since the colonists of
North America succeeded In achieving inde-
pendence, despite the most strenuous exer-
tions of the fighting power of Great Britain,
the ruling class in that country appear to
lose all nerve when a question of white
colonists and their inclinations arises.
• •
It is almost humiliating, even to an Aus-
tralian, to observe the timorous flutter occa-
sioned among British statesmen by the rough
and vigorous arrogance of the Premier 'of
Queensland. The statesmen of the some-
time Great Power evidently do not know
which way to turn. To concede the demands
of the colonists is plainly to countenance a
distinct step towards ultimate independence
and separation. But to refuse concurrence
appears a sure way of accelerating the very same
thing. As a matter of fact, the dilemma is
one which a great statesman would speedily
solve. He would either recognise that
it is “ the manifest destiny ” of Australasia
to develope into a mighty nationality, or
would perceive the fallacy of such a forecast.
In the former case he would bow to
the Inevitable, and address himself to pre-
paring the way to a separation which
should be effected in a manner and
in a spirit calculated to ensure the
maximum of advantage to the mother country.
If, on the other hand, he flouted the “ mani-
fest destiny ” theory, he would set himself
to foil the separatist tendencies of the
colonists. A British statesman who had
faith in the abiding grandeur and power of
his country, would see little difficulty In
dealing with the aspirations of rampant
colonies. He would believe that he possessed
two methods of attaining success, each pro-
bably capable of achieving success, separately;
and both, united, bar tain of doitig so. Of
these, one is cajolery, and the other is forbe.
No able rtian attempts force until he has
made sure that cajolery is vain. Hence
ca jolery would probably be the first recourse .
And it would be a dangerous weapon if em-
ployed in real earnest. Tnere would be no
difficulty whatever in seducing front separa-
tist inclinations a powerful section of the
most influential class in the community. The
wealthy lower orders would be only tco happy
to meet the seduction half-way. Having
money, they sigh for distinction which the
moneyless should not share. Political
station is not maintainable without ability
distinct from the mere sordid faculty of
acquiring and accumulating wealth. There
have been Premiers and othei’Ministers who
have gained office chiefly because they were
wealthier than other aspirants. Bub none
have long held office so acquired. They have
been jostled out of power by “penniless
adventurers ” as they love to call the class of
brainy men whose intellectual qualities are
of a higher than the grubbing order. The
magnate of Potts Point or Toorak is
shouldered out of the place of power and
prominence by some fellow who would he
out at elbows were he to wear only coats he
paid for; or by some other, chiefly notable in
private life for his disreputable habit of ob-
taining moneys by false pretences, or his
constant condition of chronic insolvency.
• *
There is no joy in distinctions only to be
won by sacrifices and exertions, only to be
maintained by strenuous effort, not to be
had at all without a disagreeable com-
plaisance to the vulgar crowd, and, after all,
shared with every Ton, Jack, and Harry
who has parts enough to humbug the public
and make himself troublesome in Parliament.
• * •
Hereditary distinctions are baits that would
hook the entire snobocracy of the Australias.
It is positively wonderful that the British
governing class has not perceived this long
ago. It is more than probable that
they will perceive it very shortly. Perhaps,
however, the recognition (f the fact may
come too late. Even now it would be
awkward for any professing National Aus-
tralian of note to accept a titular distinction
from the Imperial Powers. The contempt
for colonial personages felt by an hereditary
Sovereign, an old nobility, and the series of
simulative gentry who give a tone to the
ideas of the governing class in Great Britain,
has been permitted sway somewhat over
long. For lack of a titled class and the sig-
nificant class which either grovels to titles
or hopes vaguely to gain one somehow or
sometime, the Democratic sentiment is be-
coming hard set in these colonies. There is
actually only one Australian baronet in Aus-
trafia, and there have been but three or four
such creations altogether. With haughty
disdain the Sovereign and her counsellors
have treated colonists as unworthy of sharing
in even the meanest of existing distinc-
tions. Even the order of the Bath,
of which so many of our wealthy lower
orders are so obviously in need, has
been withheld from them. A special
order has been Invented to spare the bearers
of distinctions more antique the degradation
of association with the despised colonists,
and so little regard has been held for that
order that no pains have been taken to ex-
clude from participation in it, even among
those who have been affronted by nomina-
tion to its distinctions, men held in con-
tempt among the society in which they
moved. Thus by an inspired perversity of
stupid hauteur even those whom it was
thought proper to decorate, have been
affronted, and no Imperialistic sect hss been
created among the colonists. More saga-
cious counsels may, however, yet prevail,
and among the gravest dangers to Australian
independence is the possibility that the
adroit cajolery of titular distinctions may
create divisions among our people.
•
Failing this, the alternative of force re-
mains. It has been a fashion with shallow
declaimers to call attention to the fact that
the populations of Australian colonies now
aggregate more than the number of inhabi-
tants of the British North American provinces
at the time when they wrenched their freedom
from the resisting grasp of Great Britain. The
inference has been drawn that, consequently,
a similar contest here would certainly have
like results. That impression appears also
to prevail among the legislators and rulers
of England. On no other hypothesis can
their meek submission to the flouts of
colonial leaders be explained. But, no
matter by whom the idea is held, it is un-
doubtedly attributable to a superficial ac-
quaintance with history. The Americans
revolted, struggled, and were successful.
These are the naked facts. And on these a
precedent is founded. But the student of
history knows how dire was the struggle and
how uncertain the event for year after year.
He knows that it was not the colonists of
America alone who foiled the might of
Britain, but that the fleets and armies of
France co-operated in the struggle, and
Great Britain had on her hands, during its
continuance, not merely her revolted
colonists, but the French and the Dutch.
Moreover, the conditions of warfare were
entirely different from those which now pre-
vail. The American settlers had among
them bodies of veterans accustomed to face
in tho field the soldiers of the French
king. The backwoodsmen were har-
dened guerillas, inured to warfare by
their constant skirmishes with the dan-
gerous aborigines. They were marksmen
from childhood. And the civilian of
those days fVioh his fowling piece was a
better armed man than the regular troops
with their clumsy and wild-shooting muskets;
To-day all that is changed. The arms of the
civilian are paltry as contrasted with the
weapons of the soldier. A crowd of country-
men such as confronted the British troops at
Lexington, and drove them back in confusion
and dismay, would to day be mowed, down
with ease and certainty. Tj'he moral of these
considerati ons is simple. The hopes of Aus-
tralian nationalists at the present must be
centred less in their own strength or adroit-
ness than in the remarkable capacity for
blundering displayed by the representatives
of the would be exploiters of Great Britain.
The Women's Elysluin.
JNew South Wales is “the Paradise of the work
mg man,” so says Premier Paekes, and California
must be the elysium of the enterprising woman; to
judge from the short and simple story of a sweet
young lady’s life, as told by herself to a correspon-
dent of The Bulletin. She was married, poor
dear, at an early age to a youthful and well-to-db
but uncongenial coppersmith. He had a big shop
in a main street in San Francisco; he made a pot
of money and he let his wife spend it. Could a
young coppersmith do more ? She thought So and
she tried. She found her affinity, and she cdn-
fided the fact to the coppersmith who forgave her
want of taste and took the gentleman into his own
confidence. She found another cicisbeo when she
tired of the first, and the complaisant Copper l
smithj to whom in the first years of their marriage
she had borne two children, cottoned to the
second lover as he had done to the other and to a
long series of them afterwards, each time swear -
mg that it was only for the sake of the
children that he refrained from blowing
the roof of the affinity’s head off. Finally, the
fickle fair one got so fearfully mashed upon a new
arrival who had, by the way, left his own wife in
the East—that she insisted upon having a divorce
from the coppersmith and marrying her latest
flame. The coppersmith was getting so tired of
the succession of guests who tramped in and out
of his house from the moment he left it until the
moment he returned, that he agreed to the
arrangement. As is usual in such cases, the lady
applied for the divorce; the much-wronged hus-
band offered no opposition, the ill-matched couple
were set free, and the lady married her new lover,
whose deserted wife also procured a divorce in
double-quick time.
* • •
This new deal in the matrimonial game proved
unsatisfactory, and once more the aid of the
law was invoked, and all parties set free from
the conjugal yoke. The fair one left her two hus-
bands to console themselves in San Francisco, and
tried her luck in the Southern portion of the
State. Here her inflammable heart took fire
again, and she ended a long succession of love
affairs by marrying for the third time. Now
comes the odd part of the story. That reckless,
shameless jade has at last turned out to be one of
the best wives and mothers in America It is five
years since she entered on her third coverture,
and she has three children by the third husband.
She writes affectionately friendly letters at fre-
fluent intervals to the second husband, who has
himself married again, and she sends kindly mes-
sages through the second husband to the copper-
smith and his children, whom, however, she
plainly intimates that she does not desire to see.
Pray, Mrs. Mona Caied, can you call marriage
a failure after that ? Well, certainly not, if you
try often enough.
• *
From the Golden City our correspondent also
sends us the story of a dear young thing who got
rid of an unoffending but inconvenient husband
by applying for a divorce on the usual ground of
alleged cruelty, the cruelty consisting of the poor
man being terribly in the way. It is a point of
honour not to contradict a lady under such cir-
cumstances, and the injured wife was liberated
from the nuptial noose. She set up a lodging-
house for gentlemen only, and was prosperous
enough. She had plenty of lodgers, and neces-
sarily no losses, as payment in advance is the in-
variable rule in San Francisco, where you deposit
a month’s rent and get the key of your room.
That day month you pay another month’s rent or
you get the key of the street. Her lodgers were
all more or less young, good-looking, prosperous,
and friendly. One day in confidential chat with
an inmate she said: “Now, who do you think
is going to take the next room to yours?”
“Can’t say,” responded the gentleman ad-
dressed. “ Why, Mister Ndmbeewun ! no
less.” “Great Scott!” says the gentleman:
“you don’t mean your husband?” “No, sir,
I do not,” responded the fair one stiffly, “I
have no husband, you will remember, for I obtained
a divorce from Mister Numbeewun.” “I know
that,” replied the lodger, who had indeed excellent
reason to know it very well, “ but surely you won’t
have him here!” “Indeed I will, sir,” said the
lady, completing the conversation. “Pray, is not
his money as good as anyone else’s ?”
“But how shocking it is,” says Mrs, Geundy,
‘to allow such shameless goings-on !’* Is it
indeed, dear madam, and are not these goings-on,
as you call them, exactly the things you con-
done when men do them ? These two absolutely
accurate histories derive their peculiarity simply
from the fact that they narrate the doings of
women instead of men, and come from a country
where the practice rather than the theory of
the law leaves a woman as free as a man is.
Here such women are trodden in the dirt, while
their male companions go free Pray, are we any
the better off for that ? We do not trouble our-
selves about the morality of our bakers and shoe-
makers. They feed our mouths and cover our
toes, and we never inquire whether they are as
celibate as Cardinal Manning or as much married
as King Solomon. We do not fret ourselves
because of the naughty stories told of some
of our actresses and singers. They amuse
us, and a,re independent of us, and so they may do
as they like. Would it make us any worse off if
we were to be equally indifferent to the purely
private affairs of all the rest of the world with
whom we happen to have business dealings ? We
should get on a great deal better if we paid
more attention to our own concerns and less
to the morals of other people. As a mat-
ter of fact we have no more right to
trouble ourselves about the virtue of women who
make our shirts and wash them, than we have
about the conduct of the men who make our

Snubbing a Governor.
With one stroke of his pen the omnipotent
Premier of New Smth Wales has deprived the
Governor of a prerogative which the constitution
of the colony expressly reserves to him. With
the same mighty splurge of words Sir Henry
Parkes has wiped out the paragraph in the
Governor’s instructions which directs him in the
use of that prerogative, and has assumed for him-
self the position from which he dethrones the
Queen’s repn sentative. In a letter written by Sir
Henry Parkes on September 10 last, beginning
“My dear Lord Carington,” he informs his be-
loved Lord that “It has now long been settled
that the advisers of the Crown are held directly
responsible by Parliament for the remission wholly
or in part of criminal sentences.” S nce when,
pray, has i i been so settled ? It is not yet two years
since Sir Henry Parkes himself accompanied Mr.
Dallby, Cardinal Moran, and Bishop Barry to
ask Lord Carington to remit the sentence of death
passed upon the six Mount Rennie convicts after
the Cabinet, sitting as the Executive Council with
the Cover nor, had expressly declined to interfere.
Upon that occasion Lord Carington, either in
deference to the representations of the bigwigs
who bored him or from some motive of mercy of
his own, did actually remit the capital sentence in
two of the cases, and only four of the convicts
were sent to the gallows, instead of the six whom
his Honour Judge Windeyer destined to that
elevated punishment. Pray, did Sir Henry
Parkes then join in asking Lord Carington to
exceed his duty and disobey his advisers, who
were avowedly opposed to any modification of the
punishment? If so, he struck a blow at Constitu-
tional Government which he should have been
ashamed to deal. If not, there must have been
some time since the execution of the Mount
Rennie convicts when the power passed from
the hands of the Governor into those of his
advisers.
• •
The truth is that the Governor does nob in this
matter stand in relation to bis advisers as the
Queen stands in relation to her Ministers, but he
rather stands in this particular aspect as a
Minister adv.sing the Crown. The Qaeen exer-
cises the prerogative of mercy here, and the
Governor as her representative advises her ai to
the fitness of the object. Practically he decides
in her place just as the Home Secretary does in
England. Otherwise his instructions upon this
point would be a dead letter. They expressly pro-
vide that in the exercise of the prerogative of mercy
he may act upon his own responsibility, merely
directing that if he differ with bis advisers he
shall formulate his reasons in writing for acting
contrary to their advice. Were ib otherwise Sir
Henry Parkes would have been guilty of the
grossest impropriety when he ventured to approach
the Governor to urge upon him the exercise of a
prerogative which did nob belong to him, bu i had
passed to his advisers. Nor dees the recent dis-
cussion between the late Sir Anthony Musgrave
and his Ministers touch the question at all Tee
Ministers therein made a particular of the
prerogative the condition of their retention cf
power. Public opinion supported them, and the
Governor had to give in because he c >uld
nob get a new Ministry, So in the past it
has often been in various contests between
the Crown and its advisers. Sometimes the
one has conquered, sometimes the other. In 1852
Lord Palmerston war driven with absolute con-
tumely from office by the Queen because he did
nob allow Prince Albert to interfere with foreign
dispatches. The opinion of the public was in
favour of the Queen, because she considered her-
self insulted that the dispatches had been drawn
up before she saw them and were only formally
submitted to her. In 1855 that same Lord
Palmerston was forced on the Queen against her
will as Prime Minister, and for nine years out of
the ten which followed he was the most popular
man in England. The truth is that the forced
public opinion which compels a particular direction
of the prerogative of the Crown does cot lessen
them nor take them away.
• • •
The weak point in Sir Henry Parkes’ armour
is, as ib has always been, his tendency to claim a
prerogative cf his own. Now that ha is in office
he assumes that the prerogative of mercy is vested
in the Cabinet. When he was out of office he
went bo Lord Carington in person upon a most
solemn occasion to ask h m to overrule the
Cabinet’s decision. If he were out of office again
he would do the same thing bo morrow and would
thunder away at the Mini-try which resisted him.
While he is in office the Crown must be a cipher.
It i) somewhat odd ishab under these circumstances
he should refer fo Mr. M‘Laughlin’s statement
that “ the royal prerogative of imrey is attempted
to ba usurped by the Colonial Secretary ”
ai “a gratuitohs impartinence ” How can
the statement be an impertinence if it represents
the fact, as Sir Henry Parkes himself contends
that it dors in his concluding sentence. It would
be interesting to know what Lord Carington
thinks of the matter, bub he is clearly of opinion
that the power of yawning was given man to
enable him to conceal his thoughts, and, afeer all,
an inarticulate aw—aw—yaw does nob always
give consent.
Judge Docker and the rest of the legal authori-
ties of New South Wales are at issue over what
looks a very simple point. The J udge holds that
io the case, say, of a prisoner charged with_ em-
bezzling from his master a sum, first of £5, on
another occasion £5, and on another occasion £5,
that on the prisoner’s guilt being established in the
first case, and pleading guilty cr being found guilty
in the other cases, he shoull receive a separate
sentence for each, or a cumulative sentence.
Tne judges of the Supreme O mrt, the At'o-ne ■
General, and the Minister of Justice hold a con-
trary view, and the Minister hints that should
the judge carry his theory into practice any more
he may be removed from the Bench. The Bulle-
tin urges that Judge Docker is logically right
and that the fact that the authorities above-named
don’t think so is an evidence that they don’t
believe in the deterrent effect of punishment. If
a thief has once committed larceny, the know-
ledge that he can keep on stealing without adding
to his punishment is likely enough to make him
steal the sheep instead of the lamb. Most of the
legal physicians evidently have no faith in their
own medicine. Neither have we. But, never-
theless Judae Docker’s position is logically un-
aa::ail - lc.

I lie Republican Parkes.
Sir Henry Parkes’ motion regarding the ap-
pointment of Imperial Governors in Australia
suggests that the ex-Charbist of past years is
feebly atiemp ing in his old age bo pose once more
as the Tribune of the People, and to strike a c- m-
pronr'se between God and Mammon. The
National movement has evidently taken the
Father of the Kiaira Ghost by surpr’se. All
through his career he has been striving ti do
something original, but never comprehending
where anything original should be done, and while
he was aimlessly potteiing with scheme s for build
ing a Daadhouse and for jumping the name of
Australia, MTlwraith called the National
party together, and took the lead with no
one to question his position. Under bis
guidance the movement has grown so rapidly that
the slow moving potentate of New South Waffs
now finds he must either declaie himself as an
apostle of the new faith or run the risk of being
stranded on the shores of oblivion among the for-
gotten wrecks of old-time Conservatism ; and the
three-headed resolution which he placed before
the rowdy Assembly in Macquarie-streeb, Sydney,
was a sad and feeble attempt at a compromise be-
tween the utterly irreconcileable principles of Im-
perialism and Independence. Ib began and ended
with an abject apology, and sandwiched in be-
tween the two apologies was adismal, small, washed-
cu‘ offenceagainstbhedoctrine of divine right which
looked ridiculously small iu comparison with the
preliminary drivel by which it was smothered and
explained away. The whole combination ran
thus: —
We, your Majest/’s loyal and dutiful subjects, the
members of the Legislative Assembly of New South
Wales, in Parliament assembled, desire to renew the ex-
pr.ssion of our dtvoted attachment to your Majesty’s
throne aad person, aad to respectfully represent that
circum-t,v rers-occuiring in a neighbouring colony have
given rise to certain grave considerations in t elation to
appoint nents to the office of Governor. 1. We gratefully
acknowledge the wisdom of the selection of the pre-
sent representative of your Majesty in New South
Wales, who, in the performance of his high duties, has
secured the respect and confidence cf all classes cf
the inhabitants. 2. In view of the great and grow-
ing iuterests of this colony in connection with the Em-
pire, we desire dutifully to convey to your Majesty the
expression of our opinion that no person ia the future
should be appointed to the office of Governor who has not
had experience in the conduct of public affairs in high
political office or in the Impeiial Parliament. 3 Though
not desirous of interfering with the functions of your
Majesty s Imperial advisers, we humbly submit that it is
desirable and reasonab'e, and in strict aecoid with the
p-ivileges cons'itutionally conferred upon your Majesty s
Australian subjects, that in future the Government of the
colony should be iufoimedcf any intended appointment
to the high effijo of Governor before such appointment is
finally made.
The resolution thus divides itself into three heads
and a preface. Tne preface embedit s nothing
sav j a so'pmn declaration that the people i f New
South Wales continue, under all circu n-
stances, to bow in abject homt-re to the
British mona ch. Toe next paragraph is a
fulsome laudation of Carington ; and after this
cou es the expression of a rhi duke hope that in
future persons as unlike Carington as possible
willb) sent out bo rule over New South Wales;
while ihe closing lin°s ' xp’.aiu that if the Imperial
authorities choose to tit on the petitio era and
continue exporting tired out men of fashion—just
like Carington—1 1 represent the Crown in these
parts, New South Wales can't help it, and things
will go on just the same as before the was s it o i.
The right of Australia t) have s me voice in the
selection of her own Governors is nowhere in-
sist d on; on the contrary, the author of the
resolution is cartful bo explain that Austra’ia
has no such right, and merely asks as a favour to
be granted anything that Britain feels inc’ined to
give her. Yet. despite its feebleness, the utter-
ance of the New South Wa’oi Pailiamenb has
created a deep sensation in Londor. The idea
*hat any temblance of a pro'rst against Tin
perialism could possibly come from the c.Jony
which sent its feather-bed si 1 iiers to the
Soudan, filled the British legislator) with a
sentiment if surprise as great as that ex-
perienced by the schoolmaster who is caned by a
small boy in the fourth cla'S; and for the moment
Parkes poses both in England and Australi i as
the coming Tribune of the People. Even
M'Jlwraith sent along an expression of his co--
dial approva 1 , but then long experience has taught
the Qieens and Premier that he who expects
much from Parkes shall inevitably be disap-
pointed, and in hi) surpriie at having received
even a semblance of support from the great
Hi-Ham he probably said more than he would
have uttered in a calmer moment,
♦
The London Standard, weeping over the new
difficulty with Queensland, says that t-he “ want
■ of tact ” manifested by the miserable Knutsford
is the cause of the whole disaster. The Standard,
like Knutsford, considers that the whole duty of
a British colony is to take any kind of Gjrermr
that Britain may choose to send, even though he
may be deaf and dumb and paralysed and vacant
in bis mind, but Knutsford, b?ing devoid of tact,
foolishly endeavoured to enforce btiis principle. If
he had been a judicious Tory, in the estimation of
the Standard, he would have thought a lot and nob
t ail thi g— ' !.:ch f c l ’n r iv'id/aii r.t evidently
means that the Tory dogmas of the day must be
kept in a dry spot and not exposed to the weather.
In other words, the theories of the latter-day
Conservative, like a badly-stuffed mummy,
crumble to dust when the lid is taken off.
Whether it is worth while owning principles which
are not to be put into practice is a somewhat diffi-
cult question, but in the opinion of the Standard
the plausible fossil of the d »y should cling w ith a
benacioils grasp to the old dnjtiines of divine right
and hev'en sent absolutism, but should say noth-
ing about them, and when anybody, even nn< tenth
his own size, tramp< hfavily on his cherished gods
he shou'd applaud him for doing it and say “all
litee.” In short, the Tory of the present era is in-
formed by his own especial ere an that he must
only be a Tory when there is nobody looking, and
the rest of the time he must be a doubled-up
apology for a Republican in order to save himself
from being kick-d. Of such is the kingdom cf
British polit'es.

President Purvks, of the Australian Natives
Association, h-s sesmingly turned tail on his
recent prot< stall ns that “separation from
the dear old mother country is inevitable ”
Toe Imperialists have nobbled him, and
the other dav the apostate “firebrand”
went down to Kyneton in company with
Raonet Clarke, *o paint a beautiful picture of a
Federated Australia, g iverned by a member of
the Royal family As the Australian Nativts’
A ; srciation has no p licy beyond the utterances
of Purves io may now be regarded as incor-
pora tsd with the Imp? rial Federation League, of
which latt< r Native Sir William Clarke has
always been a member. Under th“se circum-
stances the A.N.A. can confidently hop" 1 (o be
taken up by the Argus and Sydney Morning
Herald at the first convenient opportunity.
An elaborate scheme is now on foot for shipping
Mr. Gooduhap, ex-Commissioner of NewSuith
Wales railways, to the beloved mother-land on a
political mission which will keep him safely out of
the way till aft* r next general election. An awk-
ward impression has arisen that Mr. GOODUHAP,
if he is not previously dispose 1 of, may be inclined
toccntest the Red ern «-at, and if hed)<« the
crust of the venerable “Honest John” utheh
land will ineviiably le busted beyond repair, so
arrangements are being made to despatch the ex-
Commissioner “home,’ at a cist of £4OOO,
that he may ponder over certain unspecified
details of British railway management, and c >me
hack stored wioh facts and general information.
Of course it is understood that Mr. Eddy, who
has just arrived from Scotland, knows all that
Mr. Gooduhap is going ho ne to learn, and that if
he doesn’t he should nevi r have been appointed ;
and it is generally recogni ed that in any case
Mr, Goodchap has no further connection with the
railway system of New South Wales, and even if
he returns stoked up with railway knowledge
which was never known in Australi t before he will
have no chance of put ing it to any possible use ;
but the “ mission ” rn wh : ch he ii t o be
despatched will give the remains of poor o’d
Sutherland a show for another term at R-d-
-fern, and £4OOO paid out of the colonial Tre v-
sury is not too high a price for such a public
benefit Sutherland's ossified intellect was ntver
of much use in the Cabinet, but he is a harmle s
fossil who votes straight and asks comparatively
few awkward questions and never makes a mw, and
consequently his loss would be well-nigh irre-
parable to the Parkes Administration. His
presence, 100, lends respectability to the
motl-y caravan of the great Hi-Ham ; he
is more sober and less insolvent than
several of the Government following, and if he
knows nothing about h : s Department and has
had no technical educ stion which qualifies him to
tell a locomotive from a kangaroo that is ho reason
why Goodchap should get into Parliament. St
the ex-Commissioner is, as at present arranged, to
travel through Europe in search of knowledge
which Commissioner Eddy will throw under the
table on his return, and the patient old mule of a
country is as usual to pay the bill.

The cable announces the death of Viscount Port-
man at the age of 89, and the Australian d ally
press tells us all about his honours and dignities,
bub nothing about how he manag d his estates.
For many years the colossal p.-operli s of this
decrepid old monopolist have been shepherded
and added t> by his agents and his heirs, for
Viscount Portman was one of the great rack-rent-
ing landlords of London, and leaves behind him
millions up n millions wrung directly from the
toil anl the scraping and pinching of thoso
whom he ironically c lied his ‘ tenants.” You
wen a shop'reei e•, ray, and took a plies of
business on Uase from Viscount Postman s agent.
When your seven years’ lease was up he woolJ.
give you another lease —oh, yes. You would have
to pay him, s ly, 20 per cent, more rent and a
£2OOO bonus for the renewal, and as often as not
you would have to spend as a further condition of
that renewal a thiusand or two in impr ving
Viscount's Portman's premises, which, in any case,
you had to keep stii tly in erder under penalty of
ejectment. NotLng ag > a large number of leases
on Portman s huge L radon property fell in and
he made a million or two in cash by blackmailing.
And now the new Viscount Portman, another
grey-headed old grabster, takes up the lash. How
long, O Lord, how long ?

During the Electoral Bill discussion in the Vic-
torian Assembly Sir Bryan O’Loghlen moved
the insertion of a clause (unfortunately negatived)
for the registration of vo’tes only in the consti-
tuency of residence. That such a measure is
necessary is obvious to all except owners of pro-
perty, who believe that lives are not represented
in the H mse, but only money-bags Look at the
state ot things in the electorate of East Sydney
where the massed vote of the Chil Service and the
mercantile interest always swamps that of the
humble proletarian dwellers in the district. While
property u-urps the plurality of votes, anl land,
or brick and stone, is represented at the ballot-box,
it is absurd to describe the colonies as having
embraced Manhood Suffrage.
The mental resemblance between Cardinal Moran
and Sir Samuel Griffith, ex-Premier of Queens-
land, is noticeable in recent events The Cardinal
lost his chance of stepping into his uncle's shoes as
Archb'shop of Dublin, through the Irish peopls
fearing that his sympathies were with England in-
stead of with Ireland. At all events he was taken
for a “ Cattle ” pa'riob, if for a patriot at all. Sir
Samuel Griffith stood in a precisely similar
position at the lime of the last general elections
in Queensland. In each case an impetuous
Nationalist was victorious. The Cardinal, in
stead of resenting the defeat or striving farther
for his old cause, quietly moved in among the
v etor'U’ ranks n i ■ Do«dy adv ! 'rc'*d to th" front
row, and has now established himself among the
leaders in the new direction. In Queensland
Nationalism, Sir Samuel Griffith uses the same
tactics. Both are coldly observant and rapacious
for power, and it augurs well for the near success
of Irish and Queensland Nationalism when men
like these play so craftily for front places in the
movement.
Writes Rev. Charles Strong in his magazine
“ Our Good Words ” for November
The Centennial year is to be distinguish'd by an execu-
tion in Melbourne Gaol On the Btb, a man is to be
hanged tor a bru'al murder ... If the only ground
on which we can justify banging is our fears, why, o i the
same principle, not torture and maim, and make the death
painful and lingering ? This, according to the fear theory,
would act as a deterrent, and if fear is our principle, we
ought to stick at nothing which fear would prompt us to
do. “ Hut this would be degrading and demoialisiug.
The cure would be worse than the d sease. ’ Exactly so.
But the question is—At what point does it become d- •
moral sing and degrading? Would you draw the line
short of hot pixseis, or suffocation, or a public spectacle
outside the gaol, rr a gallows, or death itself in any form,
or where ? Such questions may be discussed in a maudlin,
sentimental way, but they are none the less questions for
the Christian conscience. Wordsworth wrote sonnets on
Capital Punishment—very unworthy sonnets so far as
poetiy is concerned. Wealvise our readers to turn to
them, and then read Lowell’ssoanets addrcsied to Words-
worth.
The case between Mr. Parnell and the London
Times prom’ses to last till the human race is old
and Very tire d. Among the written evidence to te
perused are 40 hundre 1 weight o c documents of all
shapes, sizes and desci iptions, and of various degrees
of dirtiness, ferocity, and scdi ion ; and on top of
all this 400 witnesses have to be examined on noth
sides. Then other witnesses will want to be called
to testify as to the credibility of the first 400, and
other documents will require to be read in oidt r
to prove the authenticity of the two tors above
referred to. and both parlies seem likely to faint
before the job is hdf through. Thirteen thousand
pounds have already been subscribed to pay legal
expenses on beha’f of the uncrowned King of
Ireland, and probably £lOO,OOO more will be sub
scribed and shallowed up before the matter is
finished, if it ever finishes at all. Even the Times
b’ds fair t > be covered with mortgages by the
time it se-s the last of its famous case; and the
Commission of Judges will probab’y end its days
in a lunatic asylum, and drivel in its imbecile
old age about dray-loads of treasonable paperr,
an 1 dead cam L whose backs were broken
waile struggling to hump evidence along to
convict Parnell, and ships that foun-
der) d through being overloaded with witnesses,
and various otffir features of a trial which
already i remises to break the famous Tioh-
bornk record into small “ pi.” The lawyers
erop’oyed mostly recognise that they have gob a
lilieb fo- life, and the more sanguine hops to hand
down their vested interest in the job to the’r sons
and grandsons, wish an off chance that the third
generation may find the case still boom : ng
re-enely along in the year 1950, and may bs in
tii e to make a little money out of it even then
In fact, if the Parnell inquiry tver ends at aU ij
will most likely be through the judicious a} plica-
ti >n of violence. There is no p saceful solution of
the problem anywhere in sight.
Acu hiding to a “ New Map of Europe,” recently
published by the New York Herald, there will
bo a great wiping out of kingdom when the
pr* s ut King of Holland goes up to dwell with
William the Sil> nt in the fields of Paradise. The
Netherlands will be swallowed up by the Gorman
Empire, and the Princess Wilhelmina will either
succeed as a tributary sovereign or else will be
bounced out of the list of European potentates »s
the blind monarch of Hanover was in 1860.
Luxembourg, pait of Be’gium and all the Dutch
colonies will also go to the realm of the Kaisers ;
Francs will receive the remaining fragment of
Belgium; and in deference to the Christian law
of political compensation, wh : ch provides bhit
when one nation steals the territory of a second ib
is justifiable for a third nation to fquare matters
by devouring a fourth, Austria is to have all
Servia, Albania, and Western Turkey down to
Salonika, and Russia is to take whatever she
wants in the way of Constantinople, Asiab c
Turkey, Central Asia, Persia, Affghanistan, and
anything else which may chance to be lying around
loose. Half-a-doz m kingdoms will be wiped out,and
sundry potentates will drift into the workhouse for
frozen out monarchs, and ano her advance will 1 e
made towards the realisation of the Old World s
destiny—the swallowing up of everyth ; ng by one
huge, overgrown empire, and then the fall of that
empire by i s own weight, and chaos. Ib is an
attractive Hmla progtanme, though as usual it
presents sundry weak points which, of course, the
prophets have not taken into considtration The
Cziß who leads a pn carious existence in a coat of
mail with a tail of boiler-metal, is hirdly likely to
last long enough for any elaborate schemes ( f con-
quest; and the German Chancellor, whos \ last
three hairs have long sinco vanished, is iu the seie
aad yellow leaf and.is growing go Hy and feeble.
Then thoro are small contingencies in the way of
Sccia’ism and other r» vol itknsry m v ments, and
the long exp cted upheaval of Islam and the grow-
ing National mov» ment iu India may both require
to bt reck med with—and in short tne new “ Map
of Europe ’ may not be hung up:n the wall just
yet Ib will, no doubt, be suspended there some
day, for H Hand and Turkey and Persia and tli e
Indian empire ate all slowly dying of premature
oi l age and senile decay, but who is to have them
when they drop to pieces Heaven alone can tell.

CORRESPONDENCE
“T.L.8,”: There is only one safe rule in exer-
cising the municipal franchise in Sydney. Always vote
against the people who are in. The Town Hall festers
unless it be constantly swept out “ Steno ” (Sydney)’
1. “ The Country Wife ” was written by Wj cherley, “ The
Maid's Tragedy” by Beaumont anl Fletcher, and “ The
Relapse ”by Sir John Vanbrugh. You can get the works
of these writers at the principal booksellers. 2. Martial’s
epigrams range over almost every topic that can be dis-
cussed. Tho social habits and customs of the Romans in
the first century of the Empire take up most of the lines.
Martial is witty, imaginative, polished, but often, in
modern eyes, indecent. 3. Pitman’s system is supposed
to be the best. 4. Those who blame a paper lor
" throwing over its policy ” have it in their power
to “throw over” the paper “ J.E.T.” (Wilson
River): Have nothing to do with him “Meteor”
(Queensland): Handed to artist. Write again, please.
“ Gt.A.” (Sydney): No. Lord Augustus Loltus
is not a viscount; as a matter of fact, he is only a lord
“by courtesy”—whatever that may mean “R..1.J.”
(Brisbane): We regard £1 per head as an exorbitant
figure for the scalp of the common or yellow Chinaman,
and your estimate that their skins will letch £5 a dozen
is absurd on the face of it. We are afraid there isn’t
much money in the Chow-destroying industry... .“Single
Tax”; W e have “given the subject the attention it de-
serves.” Protection may not “ have done much for the
labouring classes of America,” but it has helped to bring
to that country, in the last 00 years, over 10,000,000 Euro-
pean emigrants, who, in their own fatherlands, were mostly
paupers; and has enabled it to find work for nearly all of
them at tho highest average rate of wages paid anywhere
on earth. According to Freetrader Mulhall, the average
Englishman makes 81s. per week ; the Australian, 40s. ;
and the American 48s. Perhaps you don’t think little
things like these worth considering, though. We object
to monopoly as strongly as you do, but we don’t want to
break it up by leaving nothing but borrowed money to
monopolise “ Sailor Bill ” (Paterson); Much obliged....
“L.A.”: Why listen to the stupid Jingoisms of Angus
Cameron? “ L.W.” ; The Whitechapel murderer may,
after all, very likely prove the greatest benefactor that the
poor of the East End of London ever had. Thousands
and thousands of the richer classes who were never
through the East End in their lives will now visit it out
of curiosity and have an opportunity of seeing how the
penniless street-walker (one of the women lately slain) goes
in to pawn her man’s boots while he stands outside in his
bare feel “Rusticus”: Thanks “P.8.G."; Thanks
for verses “ J.J.8.” (Sydney): Your ideas are novel—
so novel, in fact, that they would be likely to raise a riot
either in a Conservative club or a gathering of Anarchists.
They are mixed and ungrammatical, also, and it would
require more money than has ever existed in the world to
put them into execution, consequently we hold them
over “Subscriber”: Thanks for item..... 11 W. 0.”
(Parramatta Asylum) : If you have a legitimate grievance
you should complain to the Colonial Secretary, who will
duly inquire “ C. 8.” (W. Maitland): The fact that you
yourself say that your poems are good is rather against
you “ Wasp ”; (1) There is only one best, The Bulle-
tin. (2) You don't pan out much as a poet. Your father
must have lots of money to let you carry on as you do
“ J.N.K." (Napier, N.Z.): Thanks for poem. It will
keep. This is vague, but we don’t want to hurt your
feelings! In the words of Te Whiti, “ the potato is
c00ked.”.... “ W.L." (Ultimo): We cannot undertake to
solve knotty legal questions “P.W.M.” (Bundaberg):
Your prophecy is interesting, but the scheme doesn’t
seem to hold water. Supposing the head of Nebuchad-
nezzar’s image to represent the Babylonian supremacy—
which may be roughly said to start with Merodach-
Baladan—then the millennium is a lob overdue ; and if,
on the other hand, the thinking organ of the image re-
presents the Assyrian Empire, then the second coming
can’t be reckoned upon for 4000 years yet, and Alexander
the Great wants to be shifted a long way up the diagram.
Also Hazael never ruled over Assyria, or Babylon either,
so he can’t represent any of them, and if the head of the
spectre means foreign dominion over Israel, the only
Syrian who at all fills the bill is Ben-hadad—and he didn’t
rule Israel much at any time. Anyhow, these parties are
all dead now, and we have ceased to care about them to
any extent “Nationalist" (Sydney): We said last
week, in answer to a correspondent, that we did not think
that Australian Nationalists will ever require to draw the
sword to secure autonomous government; at the same
time we agree with you that Australia should be prepared
for anything. If the defences of Sydney, Brisbane, Mel-
bourne, and the other chief ports are not sufficient to
repel an attack of a British fleet, they are not adequate
for our defence from enemies of Britain who would con-
sider the colonies fair game in case of war—and therein
lies the reason why Australia would be safer without
the British connection. The raison d’etre of the
defence forces of the Australias is distinctly Imperial;
they have sworn allegiance to the Queen, and self-interest
makes the officers, at least, British in their sympathies.
As the watch-cry of the Australian Nationalists is “ Aus-
tralia for the Australians,” they should make it a fore-
most plank of their platform that Australia should be
prepared to defend herself, with the arms of Australians,
against the lOorld. The oath of allegiance to the Queen
of Britain should be revoked in the case of our military,
who should swear fealty alone to the Government of the
land of their birth or adoption—leaving it to that Govern-
ment to take sides in the event of war “ My Father's
Faith ”: M‘ll wraith’s action in re Governor Blake is cer-
tainly “ both improper and disloyal ’’—from an Imperial
point of view.. Logos”: The N.S.W. deficit of 188 G
was £838,732 17s. lid. The deficit of 1877 was
£1,472,115 Is. 7d “ A.H.M.”: Please call “Incline
Jackson” (Elsternwiok, Vic.): Received “ R.C.M.”
(Dunedin, N.Z.): Thanks “ Condor ” (Rockhampton) :
Your tale might perhaps go down with the maritime
cavalry “WSJ.”: It’s all very fine for Premier
Parkes to say that the N.S.W. Opposition are unable to
substantiate the charges of corruption made against
Ministerial politicians. But it does not necessarily fol-
low because the charges are at present unprovable that
they are untrue. -
The Christmas Number of The Bulletin
will undoubtedly be the greatest literary and
artistic success yet published in Australia. The
writers and artists were alike inspired by Mar-
shall’s Tonic Nervine, and thus they easily get
ahead of all rivals.
Alfred’s Fire.
Last Saturday night the Sydney Evening News
and Town and Country Journal offices were
gutted by a fire which involved the utter de-
struction of many choice gems of literature and
a 'splendid collection of printing-machinery. On
Monday afternoon, however, the News came out
punctually : the local Herald and Telegraph
proprietaries had courteously placed at Messrs.
Bennett’s disposal the resources of their respective
offices, and the Herald’s offer had been accepted.
The News, which appeared for the first time in a
black coat and a white choker, allee same Echo, was
on Monday a powerful illustration of the differ-
ence which is made by a suit of clothes. It was in
point of fact so nicely turned out by the Messrs.
Fairfax that we would recommend Alfred to
seriously consider whether he should not have it
printed at the Herald office regularly.
• *
Strange are the things that may happen to a
man in Australia ! Just imagine Alfred Bennett
kneeling down before James Fairfax in the
Herald sanctum and confessing liis circulation to
the Hunter-street millionaire ! And just imagine
the well-simulated air of placid surprise with which
James remarks i “ Dear me, Mr, Bennett! is that
really all 1 Only 400,000 a night? You surely
don’t say so ! ”
- O
Messrs. Bennett have during the week received
many hearty messages of condolence. Governor
Carington called with tears on tap and yawned
twice over the ghastly wreck, and Colonial
Treasurer Burns appeared and told the stricken
newspaper-men to go right along and get their big
weekly put through at the Government Printing
Office. Let us all fervently hope that none of
Alfred’s cookery-recipes may get mixed up with
the departmental type and be issued as official
proclamations in the Government Gazette,
Should such a thing happen we shall be poisoned
by our wife to a dead certainty.
There is nothing very fresh about the N.S.W.
Government printing a newspaper. There are
lots of newspapers in Sydney, some of them dailies,
too, which couldn’t be printed without the Govern-
ment. And that s just what’s the matter with
them.
_ Yet none the less does this thoughtful, well-
timed act of Treasurer Burns fill us with joy and
admiration. In our mind’s eye, Horatio, can we
see Parkes and Burns arm-in-arm before the
smoking ruins of The Bulletin office and saying
to us with sympathetic tremulousness, as we hat-
less stand on the red-hot threshold : “ Boys, we
are really sorry for you. Come along with us up
to the G.P.0.” Yes, we can see Burns falling
upon our neck and weeping, and we can hear him
calling us his brother and saying to us : “Put
your paper through our presses. There is only
one condition —that you shall not irreverently
mention Parkes’ name in your coming number ” ;
and we can see our entire staff sit up as one man
and shriek that such an unprecedented thing
would be utterly impossible. And we can hear
Parkes tell us to “go ahead and may heaven
bless us, but we must not allude to Treasurer
Burns as ‘ Cocky ’ in any Bulletin printed by the
Government ”; and we can likewise hear him say
that we must mention nothing about Abigail’s
bank, or about leans at IGO per cent, or about
anybody’s insolvency. And then we can picture
ourselves arising and telling the tempter to be-
gone, and saying that we were very sorry but we’d
be compelled to mention all these things, as the
Queensland-Governor boom wouldn’t last for ever,
and a man must always keep something to fall
back upon.
• • •
Only yesterday we had half a mind to sit down
and write to Alfred Bennett, pointing out to him
that his evening newspaper having been purified
by fire, he had now a splendid opportunity of
making a fair and absolutely virtuous start in life
—adding, at the same time, some few little tin-
pot moral ideas of our own as to a policy which, if
adopted for the future, would make his name
exhale a sweet and savoury odour round at the
Y.M.O. A., and would cause his journal to be ac-
cepted as a classic at the University. But, on re-
flection, we decided to be silent in the hour of
sorrow. We will now merely say that any small
service in our power shall be cheerfully rendered.
We have on hand a large basket of stale but
shocking clippings from the police columns of the
Yankee penny-dreadfuls, and if these blood-
curdling things will in any way help to pull him
through he may take the lot (cheap) with our best
blessing—always provided that he will give a bond
under seal not to put our portrait in the Town
and Country Jebnil when we are cold and dead.
Over this big fire, the damage done by which is
estimated at £60,000, the other Sydney papers,
though they kept their hearts, certa’nly lost their
heads. Just look at this, the commencement of
four columns, in the Sydney D.T.
The whole of Saturday was heavy with the mysterious
sense of a coming evil. For some nights before, the
moon had risen as red as a ball of molten lead.
That’s it! The Man in the Moon had painted the
darned concern blood-colour because the Evening
News office was going to burn. And where did
that D T. man ever see red molten lead, or molten
red lead ! However, reporters do see curious
things in this hot weather. The D.T. chronicler
proceeds:—
For some time the interest of the crowd was centred in
“ Mercury,” the graceful lifesirs bronze representation of
the winged god, which surmounted the centre of the
building. Many were the speculations as to how long
“ he ” would stand the heat, and whether he would kill a
fireman or two. There he stood in running posture,
holding aloft his magic wand, and as the flames at length
broke out from the roof and leapt at him with a roar as
of wild exultation he looked a frail creature indeed. The
figure was enveloped in a mass of fire, which played it
round with caressing tongues of flame.
No wonder Mercury wouldn’t come down from
the top of Alfred’s office. Mercury is the God of
Liars, and always having had comfortable and
congenial quarters he stayed there to the very last.
We would do the same ourselves. We were at the
spot, by the way, and saw him leave. As the
cruel forked flames ran up his nostrils he gave one
wild despairing shriek—which sounded like “ Cir-
culation Half-a-Million nightly !” toppled over,
and fell headlong amongst the hissing ruins.
[We are prepared to write columns in this strain
to order. ]
We do not blame Alfred Bennett for losing his
presence of mind amidst the misfortunes of the
insurance companies. We can quite understand
how it happened that on Sunday morning he went
to the smoking pile and rebuked the assembled
staff for not having stuck to their posts and
printed a full report of the fire in the eleventh
edition. But we were utterly unprepared for the
miserable and degrading mental collapse of the
D.T. sub-editor, who allowed a Market-street oil-
and-colour man to trade off this upon him in a
time of mental excitement: —
I was, of course, greatly relieved to find our place was
safe, as, though we are insured, our stock, more especially
the mantelpieces and gasflbtings, are of special and choice
patterns that are unique in Sydney and cannot be replaced
under six months.

Should any more newspaper fires happen in
Sydney, the newspaper-advertising business will
go bung. Let us whisper softly in your ear :
That oil-and-colour man got at the Herald in
similar terms ! He was the only cool person in
Sydney on Saturday night His intellect was
Tainted with asbestos and kept on ice all the time,
t was a wonder he didn’t try and make the D.T.
say that that mo in of theirs was painted with his
best red lead. If he had said so they would have
passed it on for him. They would have passed on
anything
Jim and Joe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sun had burnt his way through city smoke.
For breakfast-hour was past, and in the street
The myriad workers, bound in Labour’s yoke,
Passed up or down, on firm or feeble feet;
And of the men thus passing to and fro
Were Jim the stalwart and the aged Joe.
The street was long and straight, and years ago
The twain were wont to meet midway, for Jim
Went daily down to work, while aged Joe
Came daily up, and thus encountered him ;
And at the spot Jim looked for Joe, and while
The crowd surged by, Joe answered with a smile,
But time went on, and midway in the street
The crowds still surged, and Jim looked round
for Joe ;
But Joe was toiling up on slower feet
A dozen yards below the spot, and so
Jim thought, in passing, “ Joe is falling back ;
He can’t keep time, as once, in the old track !”
And years again, Jim striding down the street
To catch the work that passed with rapid pace,
Encountered Joe, on slower, feebler feet,
Another dozen yards below the place
Where first they met, when sun had burnt
through smoke
On myriad workers bound in Labour’s yoke.
And farther down, and farther still below,
As time went by, Jim, looking through the
crowd,
Espied the tott’ring form of aged Joe
Advancing slowly, with the white head bowed ;
And Jim thought, “Joe will never meet me more
Half up the street, as in the days of yore !”
And one day Jim walked down the street, and Joe
Was nowhere to be seen ; and at the end
Jim stood and murmured, “ As I thought, ’tis so;
No more he’ll meet me, as my way I wend ;
For years we met; but lower, time by time,
For age was bound to yield to lusty prime !”
The sun had burnt his way through smoke, and so
Jim turned once more into the street, and said :
“No more, or in the middle, or below,
While myriad workers haste for daily bread,
Will Joe pass by and I pass on by Joe,
For prime is lusty and old age is slow !”
But while he spoke Joe’s coffin’s passed him by,
And Jim took off his hat, and said : “ I see,
’Tis true a man to do his best must die !
Now, Joe, alive, has never passed by me
At this part of the street —for lusty prime
Was always able for the quicker time.
“Bub this is proof that we are weak and vain
Who pride ourselves on strength to purpose
wed,
Or plume ourselves on speed of valiant brain,
For, after all, the dead man gets ahead.
And if the world dropped dead to-day, I know
We all would be ‘ahead,’ like aged Joe.”
E. LOWE.
Sydney, 1888.
While the bishops, parsons, churchwardens,
deacons, elders, Sunday-school teachers, Christian
young men, and all who live, directly or in-
directly, on the profession of piety, are forever
wondering “ how the Churches can check the
growing scepticism ” of this wicked age, it is a
melancholy fact that the Churches have given up
all idea (if they ever had any) of inducing the in-
dividual sceptic to accept a full salvation. There
are many bearers of glad tidings to the unclothed
heathen; there are missionaries for the civilised
working-man whose religious education has been
neglected ; there are churches, chapels, and Little
Bethels for all who hunger and thirst after right-
eousness, or pretend to. But nobody tackles the
wild agnostic in his lair. Let such a one
take up his villa residence in a new parish
and what happens ? In due course a man with
long hair calls to enquire which place of worship
the new.arrival wishes to patronise. Themis-
guided wretch answers that he attends no place of
worship at all. Then the visitor leaves off looking
like a brother in Grace and mumbles something
about Moses and the Prophets. And when the
other man expresses doubts about Moses, it in-
variably happens that his visitor gathers up his
tracts and takes the glad tidings next door. He
never returns. The parson doesn’t come to that
house. No more charity circulars, even, are
stealthily poked under the door. There are ser-
mons, church conversaziones, tea-fights, special
prayer meetings, and what not for the ninety and
nine just parishioners who need no repentance,
but that wandering sheep is left to die in the
wilderness. Yet, to hear the apostles of snuffle
talk, one might think they were burning for an
opportunity to convert the educated unbeliever,
and drag him into the fold by a chain of incontro-
vertible Christian evidences. Not they, however.
A parson’s house is always open to any of his well-
dressed pew-renters who call to exchange con-
gratulations with their shepherd on the saved con-
dition of their respective souls. But let any man
in Sydney call upon a pastor of his parish, saying,
“ I don’t accept the Bible as inspired. I believe it
to be considerably apocryphal. lam not a Chris-
tian in the Church sense of the term. Can you
reason me out of my scepticism ?” The parson
will ask that man to go away immediately and re-
pent while there is time.
Poor DI Murska.
Anyone who wants to sermonize may
find a fruitful text in the fate of poor lima di
Murska, who, we read in the papers, has been
found starving and imbecile in New York, where
it is to be hoped she will find friends, since that
city has been the scenes of many of the most
liberal actions of her impulsively generous life.
The sermon should, alas ! be one in favour of
selfishness, for had lima di Murska been selfish
she would be an extremely wealthy woman. As
it is, if everybody who has benefited by her bound-
less generosity would restore to her but 5 per
cent, of the amounts they owe to her bounty, she
would be placed far above want for the rest of her
natural life. “ Ouida ” describes great singers
as having “ the throats of thrushes and the maws
of sharks,’ That this has been true of many of
them cannot be gainsaid, though, fortunately, our
famous English singers are not open to the charge,
as those who knew Clara Novello, Anna Bishop,
and Charlotte Sainton Dolby can testify, and
certainly beside the names of those nobly generous
women may be written that of our friend the eccen-
tric but much-wronged and ill-treated Di Murska,
For one thing alone that she did the
hearts of the whole of her profession should be
turned to her in the hour of her distress. In
1873 she was engaged by Madame Pauline
Lucca as the prinia soprano leggiera of
an opera troupe that artist was taking to
Havanna. The authorities make it a rule
that all theatrical managers shall give bonds
before landing a troupe that the mem-
bers of the company shall not be left destitute
at j 6 C^l ar 8 e the State, and these bonds
Madame Lucc%, a very rich woman, gave without
hesitation. But the speculation proved a dire
failure, and Lucca, not caring to pay the enormous
losses, secretly sent away her jewellery and valu-
ables and then tried to escape in disguise. She
was arrested on board the steamer, and in a rage
defied the authorities and refused to pay a cent.
The salaries were all in arrear, the company were
stranded without means, and the choristers, or-
chestra, and others of the small fry were face to
face with starvation. In this strait, Di Murska
came to their rescue. She telegraphed to her
agents in New York and they cabled to her
bankers in Vienna, whence money was instantly
sent out. She paid the liabilities of the unhappy
artists and franked them all to New York, and
the season’s engagements having all been made,
so that they were at a disadvantage, she supplied
them all with money to carry on with until they
could find work. This generous freak cost up-
wards of £lOOO sterling, besides the fxceedingly
heavy loss on exchange caused by the abnormal
difference between cash and currency in New York.

It is more than 23 years ago since, on May
11, 1865, Mdle. lima di Murska, then a most ex-
quisitely beautiful girl and a vocalist of miraculous
skill, made her first appearance in London at Her
Majesty’s Theatre. She created a sensation far
exceeding that which Patti had made at her dcbtd
four years previously, and she sang for two seasons
with wonderful success. Her lovely fair hair, dark
eyes and eyelashes, her light, alert figure, her
graceful dancing, her extraordinary dramatic
power, and the almost unparalleled range of her
voice, which was clear, true and even up to E in
altissimo astounded the cleverest of the critics and
charmed the frequenters of the opera. Her “Dino-
‘ Lucila,” and “ Lucia” were pronounced
matchless, and the Times christened her “the
Lovely Hungarian Nightingale.” At the height
of her popularity she disappeared, and scandal,
never silent, connected the King of Prussia with
the flight of the fair singer. She returned as sud-
denly fts sh© h&ci I.6ft, &nd thought in thomc£intiin.6
the debid of Christine Nilsson had diverted the
public attention, she regained much of her old
popularity, appearing with wonderful success in
the “Miegende Hollandu” of Wagner, and the
Mignon ”of Ambroise Thomas. She was also
exceedingly popular as Ophelia in the “ Hamlet ”
of the last-named composer. After singing a year
or two in England, she went to New York, where
she became a great favourite, and after touring
America with much success, made her first appear-
ance in San Francisco on May 10, 1875, ten years
short one day, from the date of her debut in
London.
• • *
After a singularly successful season in San
Francisco, she sailed fop Australia on June 21st
and landed in Sydney on July 22nd, 1875. She
elected to begin her Australian tour in Victoria
where she literally coined money, her profits for a
very few nights aggregating £2OOO. On Nov. 10th
of the same year she made her first appearance in
Sydney, at the old Masonic Hall, but that proving
to be too small for the crowds that attended she
transferred her concerts to the Exhibition Build
ing. It was in Sydney that she made the terrible
mistake of her marriage with a young man already
stricken for death, who almost instantly left her
and, after transferring her money to his bankers,’
willed it all to his own family, so that she
presently left Australia no richer than she entered
it. She married again directly after his death,
in order, she said, to show her contempt for his
memory, but her motives and his are alike unsolv-
able. After her second marriage, to Mr. John
Hill, in New Zealand, she returned to America
and thence to London, where she remained for
many years only singing at intervals, one of the
chief episodes of her operatic career being her ap-
pearance as “Josephine” during the “Pinafore”
craze in an Italian translation of that opera.
* • • ’
The eccentricities of poor Di Murska were
much exaggerated by people who were interested
in keeping her apart from the world. She was
really a simple, easy, credulous, kindly creature,
easily misled, almost incapable of any exertion
outside her profession, and quite careless
of luxury or display. Her foibles were unim-
portant, her good qualities many. Her musical
training was perfect. No one could tell by
watching her when she took breath, or if she ever
took it at all. Roulades and trills and cadenzas
came at will without pause or effort. Her voice
a little metallic, as light voices are apt to be, was
yet tuneful and true, and her intonation so even
and perfect that her singing was more like that of
a lark in the air than of a human being Some of
her tours de force were wonderful. She used to
sing a Hungarian air, with variations by Doppler,
during which, after a bewildering series of un-
accompanied cadenzas, she sang a descending
chromatic scale of two octaves, alighting finally
on the note the flute was waiting to take up
never swerving a hair’s-breadth of a tone. Any
vocalist who will essay this extraordinary feat will
understand its difficulty.

Haymaeket Music Hall.— Harry Rickards ~
Somewhere about three years have elapsed
since Lizzie Stofel last raised her fresh young voice
in the City of the Beautiful Harbour, and last Satur-
day the management of Sydney Royal realised
that there was again a favourable opening for this
little maiden from the land of Sbairmany. About
once in a long time all Australia begins to yearn
for another look at “ Struck Oil,” and a long-felt
want arises which only Maggie Moore can
adequately supply. Then that bow-backed,
raw-boned, doubled-up hyaena, Deacon Skin-
ner, is aroused from his lair and comes forth
to be a lean and inconsolable eyesore before the
public gaze, and to swindle the widow and the
grass-orphan while he waltzes to the strains of a
holy hymn; and John Stofel wastes the intellect
that he was accustomed to mend boots with, in a
vain chase after the phantom of military glory,
and comes back to his old home without any sole
to his brain. How he ever strikes that old home
again is a mystery, for after he loses the use of
his organ of reflection and gives way to the erro-
neous idea that he is the Emperor of Jamberoo,
he is simply fired out loose into the territories of the
United States to go where he likes, and the chance
for a given lunatic to strike a given village in
that vast area is about equal to that of an old,
lame, deaf, rheumatic, clay-encrusted savage who
shuts his eyes and fires an arrow backwards over
the top of his head at midnight in a heavy snow-
storm on the off-chance of hitting the edge of a
threepenny-piece which is lying among the grass
and has a dog sleeping on top of it about two
miles away. And, in addition to these heavy odds,
Mr. Stofel suffers from the disadvantage of not
knowing who he is and not wanting to go any-
where, and as he doesn’t know the village when
he sees it, and the inhabitants don’t know him,
there is a great improbability to be wrestled with
and overcome. But “ Struck Oil ” has always
prospered, despite this little disadvantage,
and it has existed so long in these colonies
that it has become an essential feature of
Australian history. No one knows now when it
first started, but when Captain Cook landed in
these parts he was interviewed by a naked native
with a large club who tried by dumb pantomime
to sell him a ticket for a front seat; and that
wearisome New Zealander, of whom Macaulay
wrote, will probably sit it out before he runs for
the train which is to take him away to camp on
the ruins of London Bridge. So long as J. C.
Williamson and Maggie Moore survive the old
comedy will live, and Maggie Moore at all events
is growing no older. Dry, plodding men of facts
and statistics may endeavour to prove that she
must get 12 months older every year, but we de-
cline to listen to them. To the naked eye she is
still the same excited little Dutch person that she
was ever so many years ago, and she kicks Deacon
Skinner’s mortified hat into next Jubilee with the
grace of a child of Nature aged 17. Her voice,
too, has lost none of its freshness, and she dances
like a fairy of considerably under 16 stone. Mr.
Williamson’s John Stofel is equally unchangeable,
and Oily Deering, as Brother Skinner, is unspeak-
able in his unctuous villainy. The oil of the dis-
trict has entered into his soul; he abso-
lutely perspires .texts and passages of Scrip-
ture ; and chastened ’umbleness is obvious
in his eye. His feet are large and have a
large quantity of meat upon them, thereby
proving that the righteous shall be firmly planted
upon the earth ; and his skin shines in a way
which is either a halo or the result of pastry.
Sundry other characters, mostly moral and rather
ordinary, are decently filled, the most conspicuous
being that of Mrs. Edouin Bryer, as Susan Stofel,
and a little afterpiece entitled the “ Chinese
Question ” reveals the Dutchman and his daughter
as Ah Ka Funga Slim and Sam Lee Loo respec-
tively—which is about all that can be said con-
cerning it.
** * *
Now is the season of the year when the
holy public of Australia pines for a new reli-
gion with’some ice in it, and the old faith grows
limp and gone at the knees on account of the
weather. On a sultry Sunday eve, when all the
gas-jets are lit, and the gas-bill can be heard accu-
mulating up audibly, and the congregation is busy
mopping itself up in woe, and the patient ex-
pounder in the elevated cigar-box feels large drops
running down his hack as he dilates upon the fire
and the evil smtllirg chemicals and the ashes and
the kerosene in the region that most of the human
race seems to be going to, even the regenerate
begin to wish that there was a little less
red-hot stove in the path of salvation, and
to pine for a creed in which the way
of transgressors is frozen hard and lined
with hunks of ice. Messrs. Brough and
Boucicault, of Sydney Criterion, have fortunately
recognised this long-felt public want, and the
Rev. Robert Spalding is promptly suppressed
every time he endeavours to make a few appro-
priate remarks concerning sheol, and in the whole
course of the three acts he is not allowed to pass
the plate once. In a fainting condition he clutches
the hereditary bath-bun which_serves him as a
talisman to ward off the attacks of evil spirits,
and his golosh rises as an eyesore upon the social
horizon, but every time he speaks somebody orders
him to be quiet, and when he is quiet he is shaken
up and asked why he doesn’t speak, and in his
anguish he hangs his harp on a willow-tree
and weeps. This remark is not intended to be
taken literally, for the “ Private Secretary ”
hasn’t got a harp, and there is no willow-tree on
the premises, but otherwise the figure of speech
expresses the position admirably. Mr. Frank
Thornton has played the part of the crushed
Spalding till that broken-backed clergyman has
become second nature to him, and all that need be
said for the impersonation is that it is the original
live curate himself, and not a mere copy of him,
who occupies the stage, and the bath-bun has
come to life after the fashion of Galatea of old,
Mr. Harcourt is loud and carnivorous as Uncle
Cattermole, and by comparison with his ferocity
of aspect Nero appears as mild as the turtle which
sings in Galilee. Mr. Brown, in the character of
Gibson, is a triumph of tailoring and vulgarity,
and Messrs. Inman and Chichester and Misses
Ada Lee and Ida Herbert flit round as sundry
other persons of a more or less astonishing char-
acter. The Criterion, for the first time in many
weary weeks, is choke-full every night, and there
are wild plunging noises in the doorway and
sounds of suffocation on the stairs as the
eager crowd struggle in and wallow in the
trough of a great sea of humanity in their
desperate endeavours to secure seats. Mr.
John Solomon himself has been compelled on
more than one occasion to catch hold of something
and hang on in order to save himself from being
trodden underfoot by the influx of public patron-
age, and the aspect of things at 7.45 each evening
suggests an alarm of fire in Sheol and a frantic
rush for the door.

The Rickards combination are still gather-
ing in the laurels of fame at the Haymarket

where Abigail has his grindery emporium. Next
Saturday, however, they will be called upon to
struggle with a great rival attraction in the shape
of the Hiscocks and Friedman Minstrels, who
again lift their voices on high at the Opera House.
Also, on the same evening, Miss Dora Wiley’s
English Opera Company starts its new enterprise
at Sydney Gaiety, when the evergreen “Mari-

bility at prices ranging from one to five shillings,
a circumstance which ought to place her within

was “ horf with ’is ’ead.” Elizabeth may be

Events progress in only a middling manner
at Melbourne Opera House, and the prevailing
tone of the notices, grudgingly ladled out to good
shows, seems to indicate that Mr. Simonsen has
neglected to alcoholise the local Press up to a
proper point of admiration. Nevertheless, sundry
operas are sung and set up in a style equal, or
superior, to the best traditions of this virgin
country; also a crowded orchestra is now produc-
ing well disciplined melody. On Saturday the
young and fetching Miss Lilian Tree, Mdlle.
Lablache, and Verdi made another effort to over-
come adverse circumstances in “ The Bohemian
Girl,” but the chief of these circumstances—Mr.
Henry Atkinson —burst up the_ tout ensemble, as
usual. Two other amateurs, originally identified
with the aforementioned offender, appear to have
returned to the calm seclusion of domestic
life, and Mr. Atkinson is exhorted to
go and do thou likewise. Apart from his
mediocre voice, there is serious cause for
complaint against this young man’s face, which
somehow suggests a graven image in the
setting sunlight. It is a countenance that the
sweetest tenor ballad could do for —but to
resume. The first three nights of this week were
to bring forth “Rigoletto,” and to-night (Thurs-
day) they give “II Guarany ” once again. ‘ H
Trovatore ” on Saturday.

“ The Squire ” is having a very good time
at the Bijou, but as “ Hans the Boatman ” will fill
the bill on Saturday any further summing up of
this notable performance is held over until next
session. Otherwise it might be mentioned that
Mr. Boucicault has recently played such a rapid
succession of diverse characters that he is apt to
mix ’em up. His. ancient Gunnion holds well
together for a few minutes at a stretch, but every
now and again that decrepit yokel becomes some-
body rather like Squire Western in “ crimson
socks,” Occasional lapses notwithstanding, Mr.
Boucicault is successful in a wider range of parts
than 99 per cent, of the perfeshun could touch, and
the other one per cent, want finding.

Owing to the unsatisfactory distribution
of applause at a certain Melbourne theatre the
star makes a practice of bowing his thanks before
the curtain at that particular instant when a
greater favourite is exercising his ovation on the
opposite side of the stage. But a better way of
dividing honours would be for one great actor to
come in on the other great actor’s back.

A burning fiery demand for the humane
form divine in silk tights is now an awful feature
of Melbourne daily life, and if any anxious citizen
would like to know what is this strange disease
which is coming upon us, The Bulletin respect-
fully hazards “ Legs” as a solution of the mystery.
Under these circumstances the Princess’s is
howling likeababy on broken glass, the public mind
having arrived at that state when one comic opera
is as good as another, provided only that it con-
tains an equal quantity of limbs. “ Mascotte ”
fulfils the necessary conditions in every respect,
and it howls accordingly. It reaches the
zenith of joy when a bald-headed man in a tin
diadem requests an amorous couple to un-
cuddle. The whirligig of time has wrought
a change for the better in Mr. Leumane’s
voice and he fetched out bis notes with fine
effect on Saturday night. Mr. Knight Aston
is generally in good form, and the only Nellie
is a perennial delight. -Next Saturday it is
“ lolanthe,” wherein the ladies of the chorus
signify their celestial origin by wearing wings.
Talking of ladies reminds us that Mr. Alfred
Darapier has got them by their golden fleece with
his matrimonial question. “The World Against
Her ” increases and multiplies at the Alexandra,
and Mr. D. has decided that marriage isn’t a
failure by a large majority.

“ Hands Across the Sea ” dies hard at the
Royal, the end of its bloated career being defi-
nitely fixed for Dec. 7. Meantime the secret of
this boom grows darker than ever, and the in-
herent humbug of the plot appears to mellow
with age. Among many gorgeous fictions of Aus-
tralian interest is the case of a farmer who leaves
England when he is stone-broke, and returns six
months later with a pile of untold gold. He
acquires this rapid fortune through driving a
waggon-load of necessaries round the antipodes,
and the assumption is that he did a profitable
business with squatters and other natives of the
bush during the possible ten weeks that he was
fairly on the job. Australia is, on this showing,
a nice country for the working man. Other shows
go on as usual. The circus is still there, the Vic-
toria has let some fresh attractions loose upon
society, and St. George’s Hall has revived the
pretty little “ Brook ” for a final gurgle. But on
Saturday the Coghills return to burnt cork, and
produce a brand new wizard at this establishment.

purchased by Mr. Bland Holt, has been produced
at the Adelaide Royal, and very favourably re]
ceived. Its success in the city of churches may
be owing to the fact that the hero is a clergyman,
but in any case the drama is a good one; the
dialogue is above the average, and the situations
are effective, although one or two very harrowing
scenes take place, which fill the air with heavy
sighs of sympathetic dread. Nevertheless, the
genial Bland Holt has secured a piece which is in
every way superior to his other dramatic rights,
and it should prove a profitable investment. The
characters are fairly well sustained. Mr. Douglas
“walks through” as the missionary hero; the
heroine is well played by Miss Blanche Lewis;
and Bland Holt has caught hold of quite a new
character part, and hits the house.

“ The Yeoman of the Guard ; or, the
Merryman and the Maid,” the joint production
of Gilbert and Sullivan, now running at the
Savoy Theatre, London, differs somewhat from
anything previously given to the listening, like-
wise gaping universe by the inseparables. They
have diverged widely from their beaten track and
turned out something more nearly akin to opera
than any antecedent effort. Some of the London
critics declare that the plot is an unblushing crib
from “ Maritana,” and assuredly it betrays a
more than accidental resemblance. The hero,
Colonel Fairfax, played in a woody fashion by a
tuneless tenor named Pounds, while incarcerated
in the Tower of London awaiting execution,
espouses a strolling gipsy girl, Elsie Maynard,
impersonated by Geraldine tllmar. This
of insanity moves the lieutenant of the first-class
dungeon in which he is immured to turn him loose
at once on an unsuspecting public. He turns up
smiling after an interval of five minutes, however,
attired as a “beefeater,” and, in order to show
that a change of costume is no cure for lunacy,
proceeds at once to make hot love to his wife ; she
reciprocates, and the fun of the piece hangs oh the
fact that the wedded pair, not knowing their rela-
tion, feel somewhat heavily handicapped by pre-
vious engagements. Miss Jessie Bond, as Phabe,
scoops the feminine fancy pastry store; George
Grossmith is amusing; Miss Brandum and W. H.
Denny are fairly good; though all the performers,
like the audience, seem uncertain as to whether
the author intended the piece seriously or not.
The libretto, it is said, is more than usually sar-
castic, pointed, and full of meaning, while the wit
throughout is more of a philosophical than a
humorous character. The music--heavier than
usual, in unison with the libretto—is by no means
eo catchy and sparkling as on previous occasions,
but possibly of a higher standard.

Fairfax’s prison-song in the first act o
Gilbert and Sullivan’s new opera has taken the
critics by storm. It is imbued with the sentiment
and colouring of by-gone days, and Gilbfrt has
evidently been reading up Herrick, Suckling, and
Waller. The first stanza is perhaps the best:—
Is life a thorn ?
Then court it not a whit;
Man is well, done with it
Soon as he’s born !
He should all means essay
To put the plague away,
And I, war-worn,
Poor captured fugitive,
My life most gladly give :
I might have had to live
Another morn.

Dear Bulletin, —I am a developer of
infant intellect in a locality where the parents are
not affl cted with an intense desire to pay for the
education of their progeny, and I therefore carry
on my labours under considerable difficulties. As
an example of this I recently received the follow-
ing insolent and stupid memo, from the N.S.W.
Chief Inspector of Schools ; -
Collection of Fees Your Neolkct in Respect to.—
It) appears that notwithstanding the very explicit direc-
tions you 1 ave received as to the necessity ol collecting
tohool fees weekly j ou have a’Dwed arrears cf fees to the
amount of £ to accumulate to the Ust. Your
return for that month shows that in several cases the
debt) are large and have been accruing for some consider-
able time. Before submitting the matter for the Minis-
ter's cot sideration I invite you to furnish any explanation
that you may deem mcissary.
Now I have explained over and over again in my
monthly returns that I in fist upon weekly pay-
ments—and can’t get them ; that when the m noy
is not forthetriling I write nice little notes to the
parents begging and praying for an immediate
settlement; that I spend most of my leisure
time waiting round to talk to erring relatives,
and all to no effect I have repeatedly threatened
prosecution, lut the brawny fathers of the place
on'y laugh, for the officer whose duty it is to se t
the legal machinery going doesn’t bother about it,
and I have nopjwer to act. Consequently, the
arrears of fees keep on growing larger, and I ask
—what more can Ido ? Apparently lam ex-
pected to do a lot more, but how or why I can’t at
all make out. Nobody backs up my efforts, and
when I have done my level best the pompous
Chief Inspector, instead of thanking me, tits down
in his luxurious apartments and pens a laborious
memo., in which he says he will report the matter
to the Minister. Perhaps he thinks I should fol-
low the parents about all over the district, bum-
bailiff fashion, on Saturdays, Sundays, and holi-
days, until they pay up to get rid of me, or else he
possibly imagines that I should sit down on their
dirty doorsteps, and refuse to budge till they
ante-up. Perhaps—but, after all, there is prac-
tically no limit to what a chief inspector may do
in the way of thinking, and it is hardly worth
while to follow him further. —Yours miserably,
Jonah Pedagogue

C. J. O’Connor, a Sydney attorney, some
years ago was examining at a Quarter Sessions in
the country an Irishman to whom he was well
known and who, after being sworn with all
solemnity, assumed a look of mingled importance
and severity and appeared to possess an over-
whelming desire to impress the Court and tell the
truth. In response lo the first question, which
was the ordinary matter-of-for in request for his
mine, the witness remarked, drawing himself up
in a most dignified manner in his store-clothes
“ Shure it’s me name ye want ter know, and it’s
quite well ye know that same—quite as well as
meself bedad.” This was too much for the ques-
li ner, who impatiently said : “ Come, sir, never
mini what /know. Tell the Court your name ”
“Ah ! Shure, Mr. O'Connor, I did not think it
would be yerself as would disown me before the
Co >rt an’ the population Me name s Pater
D )olan, and well ye know it. ’ “Now, Peter,
what are you ? ” Peter hereupon looked mj stifled
and offended “Phwataml?” “Yes, what are
you ? What were jou brought up to ? ” The
corrugations for an instant cleared away
from Mr. Doolan’s face, a gleam of intelli-
gence passed like greased lightning over his
feat ires ; then ha regarded the O’Connor vs ioh
infinite scorn. He snorted contempt, his
eyes glared, his frame quivered, and, for-
getful of Judge, jury, gowns and “ popu-
lation,” in a two-foot thick brogue he exclaimed,
gesticulating with his right band in which he
held the Holy Bible:—“ Phwat am I? I’m
ashamed of ye, Misther O'Connor, it’s the bitter
of you did I think than you’d be afbher fooling
me twice this blessed day. Phwat am I ? I’m
the same as yerself—a Howly Roman Catholic be
the Grace av God ! ” —and bang came the Bible
down on the witness-box.
When Justice wandereth way out west and
comes to sojourn among a people who never beard
of Blackstone and Wiudeyer she is apot to have
her bang dislocated and her bustle unhinged and

ent undignified positions. The yeomanry of that
roasted n gion have a way of escorting Justice
which geterally ends in the legal part of her bJng
toppled over into a convenient crab-hole. The
law dispensed by, say, Bungaroo jurors, is not the
article which the presiding judge exhibits, but the
kind of thing the jurors think the law ought to
be: “But you nonce now,” thus pleasantly dis-
coursed a dweller of that city as he lit a pipe in
the brief interval between two drinks, “you
notice now if Bungaroo verdicts ain’t always right.
They may be dead agin all t viden ie, and right slap
agin all law and what the judge says, but they’re
right every time. You might ’a heard tell pf Jim
Willows. No? Jim ha was caught branding a
mattfr of 30 or 40 cawves bout 2 o'clock one
moonlight night. Now, Jim hadn’t a cow of his
own on the selection—hadn’o a hoof on the place—
siit was easy to tell they wasn't bis. Well, the
p Ike got wind of it, and ran him in, and he was
tried at the sessions. Well, the evidence was
clear agin him, and the judge sums up short and
i harp, with that queer fnoit of hi-*, telling the
jury they ougdt to convict without leaving the
uox. The jury goes out, and comes in with a ver-
dict of not guilty. The judge looks at ’em curious
hke for a bit, then tells ’em they can go
nothing m re, only he said it with a bit
of a snort like We’l, next morning tho
judge goes down to where his buggy was kept,
anri there sees one of the jury, who says to him :
“You was a bit s’pristd at that verdic’ yester-
day, judge ” “It certainly wasn’t what I ex-
piec'.ed,” says the judge. “ Well,” ssys the chap,
•• yci see it was this way. Jim had a tidy puce
of ground, and some good grass, and no stock to
eat it an Ino money to buy any. Well, what
does Jim do? He just does what you or me or
anyone else might do, yer Honor, he just goes
out and scruffs a few cawves, and we wasn’t
going to shop him just for a thing like that.”
“That’s it, you tee,” continued the Bungaroo
Bramwall, “ the verdic’ was dead agin all evi-
dence and agin the law, but it was right all the
same. And if you notice Bungaroo verdicts you’ll
find what I tell you is right. If we think a man
ought to be shopped we shop him, evidence or no
evidence, and if we think he ought to be let off we
Ut him off and blast the law.” Wi h which brief
tummary of the Bungaroo legal cede he burled
his face in a bior-pot as big as a bucket
Dear Bulletin, —Don’t you think that
a part of the platform of the Queensland National
Party should be a new gallows? Up here they
pretty often hang two people on one morning, and
if strikes me they might just as well do the
horrible job in one act -if it has to ba done at all.
Not very long ag > tlv y hanged a woman and a
man on the same d iy. The woman was hanged
first, and they nearly pulled her head off; a
quarter cf an hour afterwards, when they had cut
down her body and wiped everything upnicely, they
cold-bloodedly brought oub the man, who had been
locked up a few yards away listening to the pro-
ceedings and to’d him that ib was his tu n Last
week sgain they went through a similar perform-
ance : first they hanged a white man, who was fat
and heavy, and successfully broke his neck, and
then they took 15 minutes to strangle a poor devil
of a nigger who was as thin as a shadow turned
sideways, and yet was allowed to fall only as far
as the wretch who had gone bef ire. This condi-
tion of affairs reflects the greatest discredit on the
old convict settlement of Moreton Bay and ought
to be looked into at once by Premier MTlwraith.
Why, Sydney has a gallows on which thiy can
hang six people at once—a gallows the construc-
tion of which, in the memorable words of a local
daily paper, “reflects the utmost credit on its
enterprising builders, Messrs. Bros.”—

Lp among the B ! us Mm n'tains there lives
an accomplished sponger whose capacity for dis-
covering a man who ‘ holds a shilling” amounts
to absolute genius. A few nights ago, at a lead-

several young fellows who were drinking in the
bar-parlour and paying for their grog on the
modes t‘ 1 shilling in ” system Our lo afer had a
free diink or tw", and then, as he fels the
ic-ness of _the cold fhoulde-, he began to
borrow shillings from the good natured land-
lord: “You put in a bob for ne, old man,
this time. It will be all right ” Thus he kept in
the swim for an hour or two. Then the landlord’s
shillings commenced to give out, atd the sponger
lurched along on his way out of the whisky-mill, and
found in one of the rooms a jovial party surrounded
by champagne-glasses and dead-marines which
told of a high old time. “ Landlord ! ” exclaimed
the loafer in the tones of a man who has a great
sorrow lying up against his aorta, “how long has
this been going on?” “Oh ! ” said the landlord,
“three or four hours.” “Well, I’m d d! ” said
the loafer —“ here have I been spending the night
with a dry-hash crowd of Sydney counter-
jumpers playing shillings-in, while all the lime I

Paddy Brown, a well-known Sydney news-

cigarettes, didn’t chew tobacco, didn’t play penny-
ante in the Domain, and didn’t pelt brickbats at
Chinamen. One night Paddy casually per red into
bir small employe’s room and found the urchin in
the attitude of prayer. Delighted at having dis-

question. In some of the colonies, and in N.Z. in
particular, many of the big papers are produced
almost entirely by apprentice or girl-labour. The
state of matters in N.Z. is already a serious
menace to Australian printers so far as trades-
unionism is concerned, and in a year or two may,
unless dealt with vigorously, altogether destroy
the organisations that the printers of the older
colonies have built up.

Parnell’s grandfather fought against Eng-
land in the war of 1812, and his wife’s grandfather
fought against England in the war of American
Independence. Parnell’s blood should thus con-
stitute a conflux of generations cf rebel blood.
Mr. Samuel T. Knaggs, M.D,, whom the
Sydney University last week appointed to the
office of lecturer in clinical surgery, is one of the
best amateur conjurors in Australia. That’s why

33 degrees respectively.
Ignatius Donnelly, the learned idiot who

Thus does Editi r
Winter, of Melbourne
Herald, gently chide
the erring reporter :
“Only five men in a
whole thousand are fit
to be senior reporters,
and everyone of the five
is usually a flaming
drunkard. And because
I’ve a teetotal partner,
by the eternal rouse-
about that yarded up

Queen Victoria, in
her old age, has de-
veloped a great fond-
ness for whist. Those
about her are beginning
to be bored by her in-
cessant longing to in-
dulge in the game, She
can stand a long siege
at the table, and often
wearies those who are
playing with her by
her disinclination to
quit. It is said that
she hates to lose her
money as much as
though she were poor
for she plays the good
old English game of a
guinea a corner.
Beaconsfield kept
every letter he received,
and though bis literary
executor has been seven
years endeavouring to arrange them, his task is
not yet finished. Sir George Grey, the “ great
pro-consul,” has also kept his correspondence, but
it is well-arranged in bound volumes and indexed,
and those who have been permitted to skim the
old ex-Governor’s letters say that they throw
some wonderful side-lights on the colonial and
Imperial history of the past half-century.
Sims Reeves could sing a bit once, but his
recently -published autobiography shows him to be
an arrant old egoist. He records that, on one oc-
casion, Sir Michael Costa called upon him to
thank him for the style in which he had sustained
the tenor part, and declared that there was
“no belter singing in Paradise.” In another
place Reeves tells us IhaA he sang “transcen-
dently;” and again and ag in we read that he
“ was never in better voice or sang more magni-
ficently.”
The old Earl of Devon is dead, and a
spendthrift roue, long known as Lord Courtenay,
takes his father’s place in the House of Peers.
The new Earl has been three times bankrupt, and
every shilling squeezable from such estates as he
couldn’t sell in his prospective right will be
scooped by the Jews during their client’s lifetime.
But the precious law of entail so arranges matters
that a “noble family” is seldom poor through
more than two generations. The present Earl of
Devon will die owing tens of thousands of pounds
to tradespeople. His next descendant will inherit
no means of subsistence, nor earn any. Yet his
heir may enjoy a long minority and find himself a
wealthy man at one-and-twenty. God bless our
old aristocracy ! They want a lot of wiping out.
Some amiable asses of the chalk-fiend

they will commence business by pasting Hell
on the luggage of Peter Jackson, and that Peter
catches them at the game.

A North Shore (Sydney) Debating Society
has decided that the decapitation of Charles I.

A New York exchange, with a fine touch
of sarcasm, says :—“The Scotland Yard detectives
have not yet discovered the fiend who lately mur-
dered six abandoned women in the heart of
London, but the Times has affidavits to prove that
Mr. Parnell is the guilty man,”
An English papar “ is surprised to learn
from a firm of lithographers that the portrait of
Gladstone is, of English statesmen, the most popu-

about the only English statesman that the average
colonist ever hears of or cares to hear of.
Is ex-Commissioner Goodchap to be
credited with his retiring pension of £937 per

A London financial paper warns its readers
against lending N.Z. any more money. It says :
—“ The truth is that N-„. is trading, and for

A Victorian Parliamentary return shows
that that portion of South Melbourne between the
Yarra and the main road t to Port Melbourne, when
sold within the last 10 years, realised £87,273 The
present value is estimated at £3,528,900. Here
indeed is a text for the land-nationalisers— or
“land-doctors,” as Geo. Ranken is pleased to
satirically term them.
The militant Mac Million, M.P., is anxious
to increase the expenditure of N.S.W. to an in-
calculable degree, so that she may be able to keep
the “ worruld ”at bay. The invaders N.S.W.
has most reason to fear are pauper-labour and
foreign-made goods. Big guns and forts are not
needed to exclude them.
The residents In the vicinity of the Scent-
ennial Park, Sydney, are still holding their noses
with one hand while writing letters to the morn-
ing papers with the other, in which epistles every
word and phrase descriptive of smell, from “beastly
stink ” to “all pervading effluvia ” is pathetically
or aggressively used. It is suspected that the
“ high” odour arises from buried Parkesianpoliti-
cal jobs.
The newly-formed Mounted N.S.W. In-
fantry Corps is already redolent of jobbery. The
captain, transferred from the reserve, is to get
£5OO a year, and the instructor, a young untried
Imperial officer named Lassetter, who also is to
draw a fat salary, is now learning his duties at
Aldershot. The corps numbers about 40 men, all
told, and it has been recruited chiefly from the
local Permanent Artillery !
David Syme, of the “ Radical ” Melbourne
Age, opposes the M‘llwraith movement against
imported Governors, opposes the nationalisation
of land, upholds high official salaries for those who
happen to be at the head of affairs, opposes
Government recognition of the “unemployed,”
and opposes the direct representation of labour in
Parliament. What is the faith of the Melbourne
democrat, anyway ? Well, he holds (in a leading
article) that newspapers should be carried free
through the post! It is time for a newspaper—
started on bed-rcck principles—to start and fight
the Symes.
The brand-new German Emperor William
has just said that “ even victorious war without
necessity is incompatible with Christianity and
Emperorship.” What an astounding prig ! Mr.
Hohenzollern, whose race live on war and the
prospect thereof, strongly reminds us of the man
who set fire to a music-shop in Ballarat last week,
after writing on the back fence : “ This place will
be burnt down to-night, D.V.”
Sir John Young, afterwards Lord Lisgar,
whom Sir Henry Parkes eulogised eo highly last
week as the type and example of a constitutional
Governor, was, during his term of office in New
South Wales, reprimanded by the Secretary of
State for the Colonies for unconstitutional inter-
ference between the Council and the Assembly on
Sir John Robertson’s Land Act. The Governors
of whom Sir Henry thinks little were not so
reprimanded.
J. G. Blaine, after touring through Europe,
wrote i—“ Were it possible for every voter of the
Republic to see for himself the condition and re-
compense of labour in Europe the party of Free
Trade in the United States would not receive the
support of one wageworker between the two
oceans. It may not be directly in our power to
elevate the European labourer, but it will be a
lasting stigma upon our statesmanship if we permit
the American labourer to be forced down to the
European level.”
The three hours’ speech of Mr. Ellis in
the N.S.W. Legislative Assembly the other even-
ing was couched in language which in point of
diction would not have disgraced “ Jack the
Ripper.” This high-class orator only speaks
once in every six months, and then he babbles on
like a river swollen with the accumulated snow-
water of the winter. Few can stand him long,
even “ Tommy ” Walker admits that
Though Sheol’s pit a place of torture fell is,
One year of it can’t lick an hour of Ellis.
A stranger who visits Sir Henry Parkes
in official hours is edified at what he beholds. To
the left of the great man is a litter of letters
awaiting postage at Government expense, while
to the right is a litter stamped by Sir Henry
Parkes. “Those,” the conscientious patriot ob-
serves, “are on the public service, while these,”
and he licks another effigy of the kangaroo, “ are
my private letters. In all my public life I have
not sent one private letter at the public expense !”
The stranger is expected to manifest high eye-
browed admiration at this evidence of sensitive
honesty.
The suggested change of title from “Land
Nationalisation” to “Single Tax” League has
much in its favour. The latter title is easy of ap-
prehension and comes more directly to the popular
mind. In the former there is a good deal to ex-
plain, and many who are sound upon the theory
are not adepts at explanation. The only matter
to cause delay in adopting the new title is a doubt
as to whether the old and the new mean precisely
the same thing. The League have, however,
given themselves plenty of time to think over the
subject, as the settlement of it is deferred till
January next.
When Wollongong Borough Council passed
the ultra vires by-law, which has brought the
N.S.W. S dvation Army such a blaze of glory, the
S. M. Herald —upholding constituted authority
—endorsed the action of the Council. When,
afterwards, the Supreme Court quashed the con-
victions and condemned the by-law, the S. M.
Herald —upholding constituted authority—en-
dorsed the action of the judges. “ The S. M.
Herald,” Alderman Parsons pathetically ob-
serves, “ is the leading paper of N.S. Wales.” But
parsons leading Parsons—well, in this case the
destination was a ditch.
The Earl of Dunraven, a rather brainy
peer who talks twaddle in the interests of his
class, professes to pooh-pooh Queensland's right to
select a Governor, on the ground that the colony
“ might equally claim the right to choose its
sovereign .” One can picture the other noble earls
raising their hands in horror at the mere thought
of such a sin against Heaven. Yet Dunraven
might have mentioned, had he chosen, that half
the English-speaking people in the world do
choose their own sovereign—of the States. He
might also have touched delicately upon the fact
that a 90-minutes’ sea-journey would land the
House of Lords among a powerful people who
sacked their two last monarchs, and have followed
the American system since 1870. Dunraven, you
are a wag.
A South Australian statistician estimates
that there are in the various colonial parliaments
101 members who ought to be run in for abusive
and bad language; 23 who should be fined with
the usual option for drunkenness ; and 4 who
deserve be wanted by the police for violent assault
complicated by language. Total 128. Of these
72, including all the assaults, belong to N.S.W.;
Queensland has 21; Victoria, 18; New Zealand,
7 ; Tasmania, G ; and pious South Australia only
4. These calculations only refer to the racket
which the hon. members have made in Parlia-
ment ; if their actions outside are taken into con-
sideration it is considered that five-sixths of the
whole legislative system should be promptly run
in and fined in an amount that would wipe out the
national debts (f all Australasia, and also bound
over in two sureties to keep the peace for 1800
years.
Daring the last 38 years that dull old
woman of war, the Duke of Cambridge, has re-
ceived from the British nation half a million in
grants for his services in being alive and related
to a monarch ; £40,000 as Colonel of the Grenadier
Guards with some cne else to do the work;
£120,000 as Commander-in-Chief of the British
Army from which he bolted on the only occasion
that he found himself under fire; £15,000, as
Ranger of sundry royal parks which would get
along quite as well without any ranging at all.
Also he has had the use of a palace free of rent aud
taxes; and though old age is upon him, and he
totters in his uniform while striving to fix his
bleary eye on some autumn manoeuvre that he
wouldn’t understand though he lived to be GOO
and upwards, he still hangs on to his multifarious
“ perkisits ” and gives satisfactory promise that
he will draw them till the end of the century.
Some of the keenest Sydney land-jobbers
are afraid that there is going to be no land-boom
in Sydney. “Heaven preserve the people,” says
one of Sydney’s most prominent auctioneers,
“ from such a land-boom as they have had in Mel-
bourne. Forty pounds a foot paid for land three
and-a-half miles from Melbourne —and not a bit
of scrub burnt off it! They have gone absolutely
mad.”
£70,000 has been spent on the present
uncompleted hospital-buildings in Macquarie-
street, Sydney, and £BO,OOO is required to com-
plete and furnish the buildings. Meanwhile, as
is pointed out by Mr. A. C. Shadier, 200 sick poor
are housed in a miserable weatherboard structure
which may catch fire any day. Yet when £30,000
was available for distribution among the rich sub-
scribers to the bogus ‘ ‘ Patriotic ” fund raised for
the purpose of cutting Arabs’ throats, the white
waistcoated donors of the largest subscriptions
calmly re-pocketed their money and sneaked off.
A commendable attempt to knock out the
“ cursed meat ” by the soothing, cooling, brain-
stimulating influence of fish, is now being made
by the Mutual Fish Supply Company, of Mel-
bourne. This new company proposes to annihilate
opposition at the outset of its career by buying up
the historic business of Jenkins, who has been the
great Melbourne apostle of fish since time was in
those parts. With such a favourable send-off the
enterprise only needs decent management to make
it a domestic boon and a financial success. And
if the M.F.S. Co. succeeds in bursting-up the ini*
quitous Fish Ring, as expected, it will deserve
well of its fellow-men, and must command the
special prayers and intercessions of Bishop Barry

Miss Essie Jenyns, who is about to marry
Mr. Frederick Wood, of Newcastle, has decided
to leave the stage : —
Cup week spurt having died away, the
great Centennial Exhibition has relap:ed into its
old condition of gloomy disappointment. There
is little fear now that this unwieldy failure will
do much harm to the shows which are managed
by men who have to live out of their profits.
True, several thousand people invest in a shillinga-
worth (or children half-price) of Exhibition every
day of the week, but nobody seems to know where
they come from, and—as regards daylight visitors
nobody can tell where they get to. In the even-
ing a swarm of girls ogle a swarm of boys down
the Avenue of Nations, and the intelligent
foreigner wonders whether it was the original in-
tention of the Victorian Government to spend
£200,000 over an indiscriminate “mash.” But the
mornings and afternoons are of such a funereal
character that exhibitors in attendance generally
refer to their place of banishment as the Graveyard.
The Committee talk feebly of doing something
to make the place “ more attractive,” but there is
scarcely one among the whole crowd who is capable
of bringing a bun-struggle to a successful i ssue. Ihe
Exhibition is suffering from that official dry-rot
peculiar to all Government institutions managed
by Government men. A recently-opened Arma-
ment Court is the thinnest piece of humbug ever
cracked up by a press which is squared with
chicken and champagne once a week regularly.
Talking of which reminds us that Sir James
Maoßam is spending £2500 of public money in
petty back-scratching luncheons whereunto none
of the leading English exhibitors (or their re-
presentatives) ever get an invite. A free ticket
for some severe concert did occassionally drop
across their embittered lives until it was discovered
that nobody turned up to enjoy Cowen’s feast of
soul, so the hollow farce is played no more. Ere
the big show closes it is likely that a mass meeting
of exhibitors will carry a vote of “ D n ! ” with
one voice.

The Avenue of Nations on a Saturday
night is a sight for the gods. It is Bourke-street
without the street. Courtesans and cads, larri-
kins and ladies, all jostle one another and stare at
one another. Visitors come to hear the music and
see the people, and for every purpose under the
sun, except to see the great Centennial frost.

The Exhibition Commissioners, among
other feeble efforts to catch the vulgar populace,
have decided to allow smoking on the terrace
running along the south end of the show. Next
they should allow this broad, smooth stretch of
asphalt to be used as a free skating rink, and
things would begin to look quits hilarious. It is
ust at this point of the premises that a smart
Amurrikan has fixed up a non-intoxicant drinking
shop which badly wants booming. The bird of
freedom, aforesaid, dispenses the natural mineral
waters of our hemisphere to all who will take them
straight. He couldn’t push them inside the build-
ing lest they might affect the pizon trade of which
certain caterers enjoy a boozy monopoly, and this
al fresco space was only reluctantly granted after
the Commissioners had satisfied the enemy that
nobody would know where it was. Thus the
natural resources of Australia are pushed along by
Exhibitions.

Dear Bulletin, —There is a fine flavour
O? gilt-edged snobbery about somebody or
other connected with the Sydney Southern
Theatrical Society—if the programme of a recent
performance is anything to go by. I find the
President, the Vice-President, the librarian, the
committee, the auditors, the call-boy, in fact the
whole concatenation, have “ Esquire ” after their
names saving alone poor Charlie Burford, the
stage-manager, who foots the bill as plain “Mr.”
O. H. Burford. All the members of the committee
who live in alleged aristocratic localities have their
addresses after their names, while tho c e who don’t,
but whose occupations entitle them neverthelef s to
rank as “pure merinos,” have the “place they
work at ” appended as though it were a title of
nobility— pa?’ example, “ Hon. Treasurer,
——, Esq., Lands Department.” The explana-
tion of the differentiating of the esquires and the
mere solitary mister is that the esquires do their
work in connection with the society for nothing,
while the “ mister ” gets paid. Very good. But
how do they explain this line in another part of
the programme :—“ Furniture kindly lent by
A. B. Pyke.” Poor Pyke lends the chairs and
the tables and yet he is neither “esquired” nor
“mistered.” Pyke should see to this and insist
on being esquired next time he lets the Society
have the use of his furniture for nothing.—l am,
etc., Timi Piripi.

Apropos of the appointment of colonial
Governors, Max O’Rell thinks that the Secretary

more real influence in ouah kawlonies than their
figure-head husbands have. All of which reminds
us of old Mrs. Marigold’s remark when to’d that
her nice clergyman was about to be man isd : “ I

generally find that when the gentleman is haffable

An old Sydney resident died not long
since leaving freehold properties estimated to be
of the value of £400,000. Now that affairs have
been gone into by the executors it is discovered
that the bulk of the properties in question are let
on long leases at ridiculously low rentals—rentals
in many cases not representing 25 per cent, on the
annual value. The consequence, of course, is that
the properties, which are about to be realised upon
in terms of the will to square up accounts with
the legatees, will be worth only a fraction of their
ostensible value.

The action brought in the N.S.W.
Supreme Court against the Union Bank for block-
ing up a couple of neighbouring windows and
thereby shutting out the daylight which had been

brought by James M‘Kean, solicitor (“long”

ing his mansion at East Melbourne, Mr, Francis
built a big wall against Mr. M‘Kean’s library
window which shut out the light of Heaven from
the lawyer. The case went to court, but Mr.
Francis did not fight to a finish ; he thought dis-

The idiosyncrasies of a recently-married
member of the police force stationed at Potato-
ville (Vic.) are a source of no little amusement to
the inhabitants of that progressive though some-
what uneventful town. The newly-hitched couple
are, as all newly-hitched couples should be, very
much attached to each other, and take the
greatest pains to make the fact patent to the
public. For instance, when “on jooty ”it is the
delight of No. 12345 to be accompanied by the
wife of his bosom —that is, when the absence of
the dreaded Sub-inspector renders such a proceed-
ing practicable. One evening last week the pair
were “ doing jooty ” in one of the principal streets
when a poor old toper, popularly known as
“Murphy the Jigger,” happened to cross their
beat. The Jigger was filled with colonial ale, and
No. 12345 was brimming over with a desire to dis-
play his prowess to the partner of his joys and
sorrows. The result was that the quidnuncs of
“ the block ” were treated to the enlivening spec-
tac’e of the hapless Jigger dragged to the watch-
house by the efforts of the zealous Robert and his
Amazonian spouse.

C. 0. Marsha 1 !, the Sydney dentist, says
the Australian’s teeth resemble the American’s,
and are not quite so durable as those of the
English, Irish, Scotch, or German. He does not
believe that the absence of lime in the water-
supply has much to do with this ; his
theory being that the chief cause is the mating in
marriage of people with large and small jaws. He
says it is quite a common thing to find
children with the small jaws of the ma-
ternal and the large teeth of the paternal
parentage, the result being a most irregular
set of teeth. Hitherto we have filled our head
with the idea that all the jaw was on the mother’s
side, and we fear that dentist Marshall’s theory,
like our cablegrams and financial statements,
requires a deal of confirmation.

satirize this monotonous

SOMETHING WET!
Hot! Great Scott! Just ain’t it hot!
The earth is baked to a clod.

A drink never hurt me yet;

Sweet Essie Jenyns, so the stories
Spread abroad by wily Bill,
Of “ home ’ engagements, London glories,
After all, have come to nil;
While yet the fashion and the rage,
You’ll settle down and quit the stage.
O ! prudent lady, wise as clever,
Fame is but a bubble fair,
Blown to-day then gone for ever,
Vanished, melted into air,
How many Essies sigh in vain,
And wish they’d not appeared again !
The tragic star or prima-donna’s
Time of triumph soon is dead ;
But you retire with blushing honours
Thick upon your youthful head ;
Ere ’twas your lot to taste defeat
You beat a well-arranged retreat.
In days to come, when future darlings
Of the people lose their charms—
When failing biz. and critics’ snarlings
Fill their souls with wild alarms—
Then you, an abdicated Queen
May laugh to think what might have been.
Sit in the circle, gay and smiling,
And watch some new, aspiring miss,
While folks around, her art reviling,
Say, “ Wasn’t Essie fine in this ! ’
For things that were, seen from afar,
Look better than the things that are.
No pitfalls now, in which to stumble,
Beset your smoother path in life—
No jealous pros, to storm and grumble—
No part to learn, save that of wife ;
And, having learned ’neath Cupid’s spell,
You’ll play that part extremely well.

trate the same egregious blunder yourself in describing
the dresses worn by the Hon Misses Loch on Cup day.

There is a Trouble (with a big T) at the Melbourne
Women’s Hospital, and it all arises from the simple fact
that the Australian infant isn’t ear marked from its birth.
This is how it is. The babes arc taken out daily to the
scullery cf‘the institu'ion and wa‘hed in lots, and it is
feared that, owing to the indiscrimh ate m ; xing up that
ccours during the proci ss, the wrong infant is frequently
returned to its floating mamma. The question then
arose, “ Gould the maternal instinct go wrong ?” and the
hospital doctor uttered comfurting assurances that such
a thing wasn’t possible. Yet s'oa after it was found
that when babes are taken to hr christened ia batches
the precaution is taken of pirn ing the u other’s name on
each childs clothing. If, then, a full-dress d cherub
requires a recognising mark, how much more does a naked
infant hauled indiscriminately out cf a tub full of others,
require branding ? And tl at is why there is trouble in
the Genevieve Ward wing.
The excellent concert at Sidney Y.M.C.A. Hall on the
20th Nov., in aid cf the widow and orphans of the late Dr.
Browne (who was killed I y a fall from bis horse at Minmi,
N.S.W.), was under the p Jronage of Lady Oarington and
in the presence cf ail medical Sydr ey and bis wife, with a
fair attendance c f laymen, the hall being crowded almost
to the top cf the stairs. Many rice frecks were worn
An Empire gown of old gold liberty silk softened with
white mulled muslin ; a sage-green poplin direotoire coat
over a jupe atd vest of salmon pirk silk; a black silk
racst picturesquely arddariogly slashed with epper-red ;
and an ivory silk, brocaded with pink flowers w'ornwith
an empire sash of sage-green silk, v. hil-.t a di amend brooch
gleamed poetically o’er the w a ers diaphragm, were
amongst the mest noticeable, and the fat woman came in
cardinal sa'ia of io bright a hue th.tp ople rear her
looked as if they were sitting in a drought suns:t. On
the platform, Mies Saville (who was furiously applauded
on her appearance) were a striped cream satin bodice
and draperies over a jupe of cream lace —tan gloves, huge
white ostrich feather fan with pearl sticks aud diamonds
here, there and everywhere. The concert was an artistic
triumph—a “feast” as fhe cognoscenti invariably express
it. By the way, it is a fact that Lucy fastens his hyacic-

According to a Brisbane paper Mrs. Mona Caird is a

A correspondent writes that Nynugee gathered its
“ blood, bone, and beauty ” on 26. h October, to hold high
festival on the occrsionof the first district ball, which
proved a great s recess. The ladies were charmingly cos-
tumed, and clearly proved that taste and refinement may
exist even under the sweltering sun of the Far West. The
ice so liberally supplied by the o:mmittee was much ap-
preciated. It is pcs’fvp ago y to think of ice with the
thermometer standing ai 116 in the shade. Even liquid
mud will, in the West, soon be numbered amongst the
luxuries of the past. Such a danoe at such a season is
another evidence of the Sparfan-like spirit of the far-back
pastoral ists.
I read that “in the work-rooms only of one leading
Melbourne draper there were over £2OOO worth cf cos-
tumes being made for the Cup ’ the week before that
event. Most of these frocks were dreams of beauty—so

caloula f ed lo reduce the wearer’s bosom friend to “ oat”

Flemington on big race days ladies perch cn the grand-

To ohri.t) this it was recrmly suggests that the com-
mittee adopt the plan of numbering scats and le’.ting

could occasionally leave their seats to “dr” the lawn
without having them immediately “jumped” and than
have to stand on one foot for the rest of the meeting after
the manner of weary womanhood. I hope the “reserved
seat” idea comes off.
Lord and Lady Carington will probably leave for the

We have had columns of gush in the Australian daily
press over the Duke of Aosta’s marriage—the gowns, the
glories and the joyings have been breathlessly chronicled
by scribes who would prefer to prepare such royal “copy”
prone rather than upright, I believe, but we haven’t pre-
viously had this picture shown us of the wedding guests;—
“The King, old before bis time; the Prince of Naples
visibly effete; the Queen’s nerves still in the shaken state
into which they were thrown by the attempt made in her
presence to shoot Humbert; the King of Portugal in the
last stage of a malady that pardons not; Plon-Plon suffer-
ing from the same malady, and rolling and lumbering in
gait, but merit Jly alive. The magnificent necklaces of
two of the Royal ladies could not, though they went
round and round their necks, hide goitrous swellings.
The old Duchess of Genoa, rheumatic, wrinkled, hobbling
rather than walking, was decked out in diamonds, and
touched up like a ‘ restored ’ picture.” What a cheerful
collection to get married amongst!

I am requested to notice a “private dance” given by

Mr. John Coglan, the “ famous Irish piper.”

In connection with the now forgotten excitement of the
Melbourne Cup a correspondent tells me a simple anecdote
about three young men who arrived in the Cabbage-
Garden the evening before the event. With all the gay
insouciance cf youth, they drove from place to place to
find board, but, as time wore on and nobody would take
them in, it dawned upon them that they might camp on
a verandah, and that, if Policeman X discovered them,
there was a possibility that he would “ run them in,” and
so would they secure clean, if cot luxurious, accommoda-
tion for the night. Strong in this blessed hope, they
stretched themselves obtrusively on the bare boards of a
verandah, and—remained there unchallenged the whole
night through ! You never can find a policeman when
you want him !

I heard a weird and awful tale the other day about what
happened to a young and blushing house-agent who was

thereof. They had done the cellars, kitchen, dining-

to the upper rooms. "This,” said the lady, throwing
open a door with a bang, “is the bath .” The re-
mainder of the compound word was lost in several
agonised shrieks, a brief vision of salmon-pink, and a
splash of water.

Tollers’ Rest.
They are, my friend, when star-girt night is
giving
Some kindly surcease from the swelt’ring day,
The only hours within our lives worth living ;
The sweetest freedom we can steal away
From the day world, set madd’ningof its clangour
And rampant with the tumult of unrest,
When from the east grows up the night with
langour,
And day glides down the vistas of the west.
Ah, what a claim to think and pause and wonder
In tboie lonely hours that we can call our own !
To foster Thought, that lies the work-day under—
Suppressed, to rise again when day has flown.
Ah, come to us, O Thought! tho’ life deluding,
Let us dream, tho’ worthless, in the precious
span
’Tween sunset and another day of feuding,
In that space alone that leaveth rest to man.

In New South Wales there is a parish
called Metz, under a trustee called M‘Bain.
In hla work, “ How the Poor Live,” pub-
lished some years |ago, G. R Sims clearly fore
shadowed the awful murders that are now horrify-
ing London.
Ah Toy’s case for damages against the Vic-
torian Government is still dragging itself along.
In valuing the loss and damage suffered by the ill-
used yellow person, it was sworn that he was
capable of earning £3 a week in China, and Chong
Goey stated that he was absolutely yearning to
pay him £4 every Saturday to labour in the
cabinet-making business. Which leads us to re-
mark that truth is getting to be so much stranger
than fiction that it ought to be abolished as being
a dangerous thing to handle, and apt to explode if
not treated with sufficient precaution.
A London paper says that Boehm’s effigy
of Gordon was hoisted into its place on the pedes-
tal in Trafalgar-square, and a more ridiculous
operation could hardly be conceived. A rope was
tied round the statue’s neck, and it was ignomin-
iously hauled up like a condemned criminal, amid
the unconcealed jeers of the lookers-on. The
illusion was heightened by the fact that the face of
the statue was wrapped in a dirty white cloth,
which resembled the white cap used by hangman
Berry, while a gentleman in a tall hat, who
directed the operations from the pedestal, re-
presented the sheriff.
After musing for a few days in the hot
sun, the Hay (N.S.W.) Record man has come to
the conclusion that what Australia badly wants is
a new coat-of-arms. The prevailing feature of
Australian social life is the intense desire to give
a testimonial ts someone because he is leaving
somewhere, and it is therefore suggested that a
capsized hat gules, with the emu and the kan-
garoo each dropping in a copper, would about
meet the case. The idea is a good one, but still it
looks incomplete An empty bottle and a bank-
rupt politician’s feet sticking out from underneath
a table form another aspect of the Australian sys-
tem which should not be overlooked, and these
ought to be inserted somewhere, even though the
coat-of-arms should burst with the pressure.
Then, if there is any space left in the back part of
the crest, a little design ought to be shoved in to
show a member of Parliament getting roads made
through his private property with public money,
and on the eff side there might as well be some-
thing rampant concerning the smell in the Sydney
Scentennial Park. Also, if the Melbourne land-
boom could be worked in, along with a design
showing the last British Governor falling over-
board into the sea, Australia would have a coat-
of-arms which, for completeness and comprehen-
siveness, would wipe out the crests of all the
habitable globe now and for evermore.
For ways that are dark Yung Ah Jack
can give the famous Ah Sin a long start any time.
Mr, Jack, who is rather a celebrity in Melbourne,
was arrested at Albury on the arrival of the mid-
day train from the south on a recent Saturday for
evading the poll-tax. He smiled and promptly
produced his Victorian naturalisation papers, but
his look of contentment faded into dismay when the
Custom-house official in charge told him that a
new law had been passed, and that under it the
Victorian 'papers were of no account across the
border. A little pause ensued, in the course of
which the officer looked at Ah Jack and Ah Jack
looked at him back again. Then suddenly a great,
boundless smile passed over the heathen’s face,
and he replied : “ Allee li. Spose me tellyglaff
to my wi f ea at Nalandela to makee polisman send
a wallant to Melboulne for allestee me fo’ no
keepee her, how you dam law stop me cornin’
acloss then ?” This was an unmitigated staggerer
for the Customs Department, but the officer gave
the heathen in charge on general principles, and
he was locked up. Late that evening, however,
the sub collector heard of the event, and Ah Jack
was released and rushed back across the border in
the dead of night. A man who knew so much
wasn’t wanted in N, S. W.
A respected Sydney contemporary comes
out with a portrait of U S. President Harrison.
Harrison, until recently, was an unknown man in
Australia, but the occasion seemed to demand a
portrait, and the artist fortunately managed to
raise one without committing himself much. It
was considered a safe thing to put on a beard in
order to lend an air of wisdom to the show ; be-
sides very few clean-shaved men ever rise to
eminence, and anyhow it saved the trouble of
drawing the front elevation of the lower jaw.
Most of the hair has been removed off the
top of the head to show that Harrison
has done a lot of hard thinking and has
come through his thatch, or if he hasn’t
he ought to have, and in any case it looks the
correct thing for a great man and seems to sorb of
fill the bill if there is a bill. The ear is planted in
the usual place, that being an organ which can be
taken on spec., and the only things which really
had to be struggled with were the eyes and nose.
It was absolutely necessary to put these in so as
to fill the space between the hair and the beard
else Harrison might have been taken for a map
with a range of mountains at each end, but in
filling in these little particulars the architect
has done nothing that it is necessary bo swear
to m any court of justice. The eyebrows
have been bo a great extent omitted, but the
student can fill these in bo suit his taste, and one
wrinkle which was commenced in a moment of
rash self-confidence was ultimately left unfinished.
Altogether Harrison’s portrait suggests that the
designer received an order fora plain, safe-looking
man, aged there or thereabouts, and carried out
his instructions to the letter, and if the new
President wants to keep a'-'ad of the police, the
sketch can be relied up n tto give him away.

Something New In Sewing Machines.
THE
BEALE PATENT MACHINE.
WHAT IS THEBE SPECIAL ABOUT IT
THE restless march of invention has enabled
us to bring before the public improvements
of immense value, to some short account of which
we beg your attention for a few moments. Our
calling is to relieve the home-mother of all that
may weary her in sewing, and to make the same
throughout, a pleasure. That we have during the
last seven years succeeded in so doing, scores of
thousands will testify. And to-day we are supply-
ing a machine whose range of work is absolutely
complete, transcending the hopes and dreams of
years. The construction and form are such as to
place it altogether above and beyond competition,
for the truth of which assertions, as of the follow-
ng, we humbly request that your own eyes may
be the judges.
We produce a FAMILY AND BUTTON
HOLE MACHINE in one. There is no other in
this market. There is no other in this world.
The “Button Hole Appliances,” so called, which
have from time to time been brought out in
America (we believe there are none here), and
which are advertised as attachable to any machine,
are all utter humbugs and utterly useless. THE
BEALE PATENT is a Button Hole Machine,
which presents exactly the same front appearance
as the Family Machine, bub is expressly con-
structed and fitted to make Button Holes in addi-
tion to all the other work. There arethree needle
channels, special needle plate, special Shuttle, and
a most wonderful actuating mechanism in the
head. All this is the subject; of an exclusive
Patent (Gutmann’s) purchased by us for the sum
of £7500. The whole cost of the Machine, extra,
to the public is, cash, eighteen shillings. We
freely admit and openly declare that this special
mechanism is supplied without profit in the hope
of inducing larger sales of the machines. So far,
the plan has been attended with brilliant success.
By the Button Holer you may make very beauti-
ful Embroidery ; a herring-bone stitch for blankets,
woollens, or other materials; you may do over-
casting or top-sewing—never before possible with
Sewing Machines —as fast as you can feed the
work. And, above all, you can make single barred
or double barred button holes and eyelet holes
with the most marvellous precision and perfection.
erein, the fingers of the practised seamstress
cannot with the greatest expenditure of time and
abour, produce work of similar quality. And
emember, the Machine-made button hole, in
addition to its beauty, is inherently far superior,
each stitch is Locked, Button helps which
ught to embellish a garment, are often only a
disfigurement. Look at our samples and judge
the effect of fine work for yourself. By all means
have good work instead of bad, especially when
you can make six perfect Button Holes while you
would otherwise make one imperfectly by hand.
Get a "BEALE MACHINE, practise it—we will
teach you at any of our shops as often as you like,
and be satisfied only with completeness.
THE IMPROVED HIGH ARM. A great
desideratum with ladies has been the rising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonder-
ful ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all
clicking sounds having been obviated. As is well
known, a good test of the finish of any mechanism
is its silence when in rapid motion.
A LARGER RANGE OF APPLIANCES is
provided than with any other machine. Samples
of work performed upon these we are prepared at
all times to submit, whilst an elaborate Instruc-
tion Book is supplied, which is alone sufficient to
explain their uses and their applicability to every
requirement.
NICKEL PLATING. —In our climate the ex-
posed parts of the machine, and the appliances,
need to be protected from rust. We have, at
considerable expense, added a handsomely nickeled
wheel, nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-
bar and cones. Heightening the appearance,
these improvements also tend largely to preserve
the parts. This plating is imperishable.
A MUCH LARGER DRAWER has taken
the place of the cramped and clumsy contrivance
of former years. When closed it securely fastens
the cover, and is provided with a lock and key.
THE WOODWORK is handsomer than ever,
being always of selected and inlaid walnut. All
of it has been exposed for weeks in the drying-
room of the Factory to a temperature reaching as
high as 170 degrees ; thus, when kept out of damp
and sunshine, it will endure our most trying
climates.
A SELF-THREADING SHUTTLE, of solid
steel, saving the trouble of threading by the end
of the cotton. It has an excellent tension, is
strong and simple.
The BOBBIN-WINDER is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by itself,
as evenly as upon the reel whence it came, and
stopping of its own accord when the bobbin is full.
We have been told that the next improvement
will be a speaking apparatus. No, the Beale
Machine will always be silent. It is a servant
that will never grumble, never rebel, never want
nights out, willing even on washing days. It
only asks for a careful cleaning now and then, a
snug dry corner, and a little genuine sewing
machine oil. Any other oil will make it sick,
and dirt of all kinds it abhors.

111-luck seems to stick to “Jack ” Want s
yachts. The ill-fated Mignonette was built for
him; but affairs on board came to such a pass on
the way out tb Sydney that the crew had to eat
the cabin-boy. Now Mr. Want’s 40-tonnet, the
Miranda, ignominiously fails to get from Sydney
to Melbourne, while a U-ton craft like the Assegai,
with a crew of two men and a eat, makes the
Voyage in safety. The Miranda had a rough time,
and was four days hove-to, unable to do’anything
owing to the heavy sea. The crew of the Miranda
must feel very small at being beaten on a trip of
this sort by a cockleshell like the Assegai. The
Melbourne people appear to have made a great
hash of lihe yacht racing arrangements.

Ne?t Saturday night, at Foley’s Hall,
eventuates the boxing match between Messrs.
Seale and’Sandall for thg amateur'championship
of Australia. In his bouts *with Tighe, O’l )on-
nell,eosteflo,‘Jack>Hall^Lees, J
Fogarty, Pettengell, Burke,* and others,!Seale has
shown he possesses hitting power and'science of a
phenomenal nature. Sandall, beyond being
an undoubtedly powerful and plucky young
fellow and having knocked out a couple of
outsiders, has done nothing to show he can
successfully compete with such a master of the
art as the amateur champion. Report says
Sandall is going to stand off and compel Seale to
make the fighting. This is nob the impetuous
Sandall’s natural style, and should he have the
patience to adopt it he will simply stand to be
chopped to pieces. Pettengell, of New Zealand,
tried these tactics, but with most disastrous results
to his frontispiece.
* * *
Dick Sandall aforesaid, comes of fight-
ing stock. The other day the butcher-
shop of his father at Auckland was in
danger of destruction by fire. Sandall, pere
asked a rival butcher named Wells to assist
in saving the furniture, and on the latter refusing,
said he was a disgrace to the community and
ought to be drowned. A fight followed, in which
Dick’s daddy came out on top, but the belligerent
knights of the cleaver were pulled before the beak
and fined a “ thrifle ” of ss. each.
The annual precession between the Sydney
and Melbourne “representative” eight-oar crews
came off over the Parramatta course on Saturday
last when Melbourne, as usual, had not to row
hard enough “to keep themselves warm.” These
processions are becoming monotonous, and as sub-
cribers are merely paying to see their colony held
up to ridicule the advisableness of knocking such
so-called “races” on the head might well betaken
into consideration. We have spoken.
* * *
How is this thus % Port Jackson has for
years been waiting for an opportunity to show she
could whip all creation in the building and sailing
of open and half-decked boats, but the result of
the Melbourne regatta looks very much as if she
has all this time been residing in a fool’s paradise.
The Sydney built boat A ileen, considered one of
the crack 24-footers, could not run closer
than fourth on the second day of the Regatta,

Lug-sails are the order of the day in Melbourne,
and the Sydneyites were so knocked of a heap to
see them holding a closer wind than the Sydney
orthodox gaff sails that a trial is sure to be given
them in Port Jackson. There was nothing
“flukey” in the Victorian wins, as it blew a
spanking southerly breeze.

Qceensland civil servants intend to peti-
tion the Government against transferring members
of their class from town to town during the cricket
season. Owing to such transfers last year several
clubs lost their best men, and several other clubs
were so much strengthened that the business
arranged for the season either fell through or
finished up contrary to anticipations.

Railway Commissioner Eddy declined this
year to issue free passes to the cricketers of the
Sydney Lands Office on the occasion of their visit
to Melbourne, to play the annual match against the
Melbourne Lands Office. Railway Commissioner
Oliver, lately N.S.W. Under-Secetary for Lands,
and himself a cricketer of no mean capacity, has,
however, handsomely provided the players, 13 in
number, with first-class return tickets at his own
expense. Heretofore free passes have also been
given to the wives, sisters, cousins, and aunts of
the players, but each cricketer will, under the
present regime, have to pay for such luxuries.

genuine Insect Destroying Powder, being certain death to
all kinds of insects, while it is perfectly harmless to animal
life, and therefore may be used without the slightest
apprehension. For the extermination of Mosquitos
especially, the Insecticide has no equal—as the fumes of
the burnt powder, while throwing off a pleasant odour
are at the same time most destructive to them. Sold In

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
( DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

gressions or excesses of more mature age, blad-
der difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sedi-

Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expense. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general informa-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONI POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the Doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
opinion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all propability,
assist you materially in describing your ail-
ment. Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest
remedies, and never prescribes mercury under any
circumstances. The moment letters are carefully
perused and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases will
remain a secret between the doctor and themselves.
Dr. Richards has successfully treated nearly 25,000
cases since coming to Australia, and has permis-
sion from at least 10,000 persons to show their
written evidence of his success. All communica-
tions should be addressed

Any sufferers unable to call can write for a list of ques-
tions (free) by which they can be treated equally well at
any distance.
Mr. Kugelmann’s treatment differs from all others
known, and is perfectly unique and original to himself. If
you are suffering from any form of disease do not fail to
obtain a Personal Consultation (Free), as he never fails to
understand the producing causes of all Chronic Diseases,
and will tell you at once what it is, and the cost for a
complete cure. You can then have treatment or not, as
you may prefer. No Mineral Drugs or Poisons are ever
used by him.

[COPY.]
Qlenhope, 19th July 1880
to H. E. Kugblmann, Esq., Professor of Natural
Science, &o.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that I, Frank B. E. Knight,
of Glenhope, was taken ill with a severe cough about July,
1883, but, thinking it was only a severe cold, I did not
take any notice of it for about six months, when I com-
menced to expectorate blood and matter very freely. I
then thought it was time to consult a medical man, and I
went into Heathcote, and was treated for four months, but
without receiving any benefit. I then consulted a doctor
in Kyneton of considerable repute for six months, and,
although I failed to obtain the slightest relief, he told me
that I was all right, only requiring warm weather to com-
plete the cure, which statement I did not believe, and
accordingly consulted another doctor in Kyneton, and
Informed him of the statement of my previous medical
attendant, when he informed me that I was in a most un-
healthy state, and prescribed for me, and after treating me
lor five months, he honestly informed me that my case was
Incurable, and that it was useless to attend him any longer,
and he advised me not to take any more chemists’ medi-
cines, as all I had taken for the last 15 months was poison.
I then pressed him for a true statement of my case, and he
very reluctantly informed me that I was suffering from
Ulcerated Lungs or Consumption, and that I was quite in-
curable. During the time I was attended by the above
doctors, I was not able to lie down in my bed, and ex-
{>eotorated many quarts of blood and matter from my
ungs, and I lost weight rapidly. About this time I saw
your advertisement and decided to consult you, which I
did in March, 1885, when you greatly astonished me by
Informing me minutely of the exact nature of my com-
plaint without my giving you any information, and even
without your having sounded or examined me. But my
astonishment was greatly increased when you told me that
you could guarantee to cure me upon a definite agreement,
which I gladly availed myself of. After having taken your
medicines for a month I was considerably worse ; expec-
torating very much, and throwing up several pieces of
Skin from my lungs about the size of the palm of my hand;
but after this crisis I commenced to improve very fast.
Alter three mouths’treatment the expectoration and cough
entirely left me, and I had gained over two stone in weight,
a result which my friends considered little short of mira-
culous, as all expected I would soon die ; and from that
time (thanks to your most wonderful skill and ability) I
have not felt any return of my complaint, and my lungs
are as strong as ever they were, and I can do as good and
as hard a day’s work as I ever did. I am sure that people
diseased and suffering should avail themselves of your
treatment, and not delay as I did until I was given up to
die.—I remain, ever thankfully yours FRANK E. E.
KNIGHT.

The banquet given by Mr. G. R. Whiting
on Thursday, the 22nd inst., to celebrate the
opening of that new and splendidly appointed
hotel, the Grosvenor, on Church Hill, Sydney,
was a sparkling success, notwithstanding the some-
what indifferent character of the ora'ory, which
indifference chiefly arose from the fact that, in the
presence of so elegant a spread, nob dy cared to
open his mouth unlees to put something into it.
A noticeable feature of the proceedings was the
strongly Republican tone of the bulk c f the joliti-
cal sentiments expressed.
Rev. Pastor Jefferis writes from the Con-
gregational Vestry, Pitt-street, Sydney, forward-
ing, on behalf of his deacons, an address of sym-
pathy with Alfred Bennett over the great fire,
and saying : “It is a great joy to me that the
proprietors of the other papers have shown such a
brotherly spirit. Mr. Joseph Thompson, one of
our deacons, recommended Mr. Chas. Fairfax, on
Sunday morning, to make the offer which the
Herald did make.” We are much relieved to
know that James Fairfax is printing the Evening
News under the advice of his religious instructors;
because, don’t you know, if we hadn’t been told
that, we might have thought it possible he had
taken the step without consulting the good Pastor
Jefferis. For of such are the kingdom of heaven
Four of the leading Melbourne banks, in
consequence of instructions received from London*
and in pursuance of a resolution passed at a meet-
ing of their respective local general managers,
shut down with a steel-trap snap last week on
some of the bosses of the land-boom. And now
people are going round showing ohe another in
dark corners little pieces of paper whereon are
written the names of such and such a land-shark
who will crack up next week for half a million,
and of So and-So who, when his meeting of
creditors comes round in a day or two, will have
six figures against his name, commencing with an
eight. The smash-up in Melbourne has not yet
even commenced.

As a frontispiece is given an effective and power-
ful view of that somewhat hackneyed, though
none the less beautiful subject, Milford Sound,
from a drawing by F. B. Schell, an artist wht) is
absolutely at his best, and revels in depicting
the grand and striking scenery of New Zealand.
Among other particularly artistic engravings may
be mentioned “An Avalanche in the Southern
Alps,” Lake Pukaki, Mount Cook, and Hooker
Glacier, Mount Sefton and Hooker River, Port
Chalmers, and the Tasman Valley. The en-
gravers have fully supported the artists by the
high quality and great finish of their work, and
the matter and printing are quite up to the usual
standard, than which no greater compliment could
be paid to the Atlas.
A shopkeeper at Dubbo (N.S.W.) was
surprised a little the other day by the eccentric
conduct of a bleary sinner who wanted the lean of
a knife in order that he might cut his throat amid
her stock-in-trade, and die with a fiendish smile
on top of the counter. She screamed several times
and became hysterical, and then she remonstrated
with this stray sheep and implored him to re-
consider his rash resolve and not to end his
existence there, but to go outside and live. But
he only glared at her and replied that he want-, d
to perish, and she gave way to tears and
asked him if he believed in a material hell,
and called upon him to repent. He seimsd
moved when she went on this way and in a broken
voice he promised that he would endeavour to
become a better man, and said he was goi ig away
to reform. It was afterwards discovered that be
had handed most of the contents of the sh p to
his pal outside while the soft-hearted prepretrix
was weeping and giving herself up to prayer, and
the shopkeepers of Dubbo have since resol /ed that
when another man comes along and d ? bites to
commit suicide on their premises they will subdue
their emotion and send for the police.
