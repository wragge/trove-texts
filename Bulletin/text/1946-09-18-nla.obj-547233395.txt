CHURCHILL'S “CHARTWELL” TO BE NATIONAL HERITAGE.
House of Seppelt interrupts the series of views of London
A in the time of Queen Victoria, which normally appears in this
position, to present this view of Mr. Churchill’s house, “Chart-
well,” in Kent. Twenty miles south-east of London, “Chartwell”
is near the village of Westerham, in Kent, where in 1727 General
Wolfe was born and spent his boyhood. Winston Churchill lived
in this rambling brick manor house for twenty-four years, at times
adding to its architecture by building brickwork, one of his
favorite relaxations. Among the improvements introduced here by
the great war leader were a large studio for painting and a swim-
ming pool with flood lighting. It was recently announced that this
property had been purchased last month by a group of Churchill’s
friends, headed by a “Mr. X.,” for presentation to the nation.
“Chartwell” must have claimed a large share of Winston Churchill’s
affection, for gossip has it that during the darkest period of the
war Churchill said that his greatest hardship was being unable to
go down to Westerham.

MEETING ON THE STAIRS.
If it’s true that Sybylla Melvyn’s meet-
ing with A. G. Stephens in My Career
Goes Bung (R.P. 21/8/’46) may also be
regarded as an account of Miles Frank-
lin’s first visit to The Bulletin, I can’t
resist adding my side of the incident in
which A.G. —in the not altogether con-
vincing role of kind uncle —is supposed
to have refused to let her meet me on
the ground that she was “not my type.”
As if A.G. would have been quite
willing to pass her on to me if she had
been what he assumed to be “my type”!
Miles was the type to fascinate any youth
with a lively sense of the desirability of
girls.
In spite of A.G.’s machinations, I did
meet Miles once at that time, just out-
side the door of his office, which opened
on to the stairs of the old Bulletin
office in lower George-street. Miles was
just emerging from the office as 1 cams
up the stairs. She wore a flouncy white
ankle-length frock and a large hat of
the miniature flower-garden design of the
period, and her long hair reached to the
middle of her back. With her short nose,
satanically bright eyes and wide, generous
lips she was a delectable spectacle as a
sophisticated schoolgirl, and 1 fell for
her on the spot.
I had already fallen for her on reading
My Brilliant Career —a real live girl in
print at last. The only one of that era
was Marie Bashkirtsev, but she was a
dismal creature alongside Miles’s rebel-
lious minx.
We had some brief talk standing at
the head of the stairs- I can’t recall a
word of it. No doubt my mental pro-
cesses were entirely occupied with a pro-
posal, proper to my age, of inviting this
delectable creature to come and have
dinner with me. It would have been Paris
House in those days. But A.G. stuck his
beard out his door and barked a com-
mand for my immediate presence. Miles
went off in a hurry ; I can see her flouncy
skirt bobbing in perspective like a turned-
down flower as she went downstairs, by .
which it is clear that I peered over the
banisters to get a last glimpse of her,
A.G. had me into his office, where he
said peremptorily, “You leave that girl
alone.” 1 protested indignantly at his
tone of an outraged uncle. The truth
was that A.G. had fallen for Miles as
effectively as I had, and was suffering a
state of jealousy over her, proper to his
beard and his years. I’m not implying
that Miles would have fallen for me, but
it is flattering at this date to discover
that she asked A.G. to introduce me to
her. As one who at that time was be-
ginning to arouse the witch-burning
ardors of Australia’s grand army of
wowsers, I suppose Miles recognised in
me another who had committed the un-
pardonable crime of essaying a career
in the arts.
NORMAN LINDSAY.
Chisholm's Dennis.
Taken within the limits of its sub-title
(“A Sketch of the Remarkable Career of
C. J. Dennis”), Alec H. Chisholm’s The
Making of a Sentimental Bloke (Georgian
House, Melbourne) is both short enough
and good enough to be read at a sitting
without resorting more than occasionally
to stimulants.
Especially if the reader happened to
have been a.w.l. from these parts when
the name of Dennis was most loud in the
land. Not that the name didn’t get over
there. It did, With the Angus and Robert-
son “trench editions”; and the Diggers,
being the most sentimental of senti-
mentalists outside their fighting (in which
they were realists enough), came to know
its forthright sound —C. J. Dennis —as
well as, if not better than, the names of
“Banjo” Paterson and Henry Lawson
themselves. But they knew not Dennis ;
and this is where “Chis” comes in.
Maybe it’s a bit of a liberty cutting
down an author’s name like that in print;
but when the bulk of the eventual con-
tents of The Sentimental Bloke was run-
ning in The Bulletin Dennis signed him-
self “Den,” and if he didn’t call Chisholm
“Chis” it must have been wholly because
of the unpredictable stand-offishness
which apparently was part of the interest-
ingly complex character of the poet who
has been called “the Burns of Australia.”
An insult to any original author. But
hasn’t Lawson had chalked on his back
by more than one imbecile “Australia’s
Bret Harte”!
Not. it should be said, by Chisholm,
but by others whom he quotes, Dennis
has the Burns tag pinned on to him as
many as four times in this too-brief
account of him.
Most odious. Comparison, thy name
is mud; but never muddier than now.
And that, leaving the poetry of the two
of them clean out of the reckoning. For
in that there is no comparing. “Den”
was poet all right.. .but why pursue such
a line any further? Yet it was that which
those who named him “the Burns of
Australia” really believed. A Glug is a
Glug.
And on lower grounds it is clearly all
wrong, too. Burns had his sentimental
moments ; plenty of them : Highland dew
has extraordinary effects. But what a
realist looked out of that same pair of
eyes! And anyone who can discover any-
thing like that looking out of the eyes of
“Den” (horn-rimmed in the frontispiece)
has an essential job waiting for him: he’d
be the right one to paint correctly the
signposts of the Land of Gosh.
There is another element in the con-
fusion,- This, that Burns and “Den”
both did their best in dialectic verse. And
what.a difference is here disclosed! On
the one hand, the common speech of a
people—then and still. On the other,
the monologue of a street barrow some-
time in Cockney and sometime in Aus-
tralian ownership, and piled high with the
argot of both owners. The last Scot
(apologies for such a blithe thought) will
talk something like this:
While we sit bousing at the nappy,
An’ getting fou and unco happy.
We think na on the lang Scots miles.
The mosses, waters, slaps and stiles.
That lie between us and our hame,
Where sits our sulky sullen dame,
Gathering her brows like gathering storm.
Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.
The last one of them heard in George-
street was making noises quite tike
these:
Wee, sleekit, cow’rirt’, tim’rous beastie,
0 what a panic’s in thy breastie I
Thou need na start awa sae hasty,
Wi’ bickering brattle I
1 wad be laith to rin an’ chase thee
Wi’ murd’ring pattle I
It turned out that what he wanted to
know was what time they opened; but
that may be beside the point. The point
is that even before that was understood
everybody knew he was a Scot. And
Big Push will win the Melbourne Cup if
everybody understands that this is Aus-
tralian :
“My little girl I” she ’owls. “O, tredt ’er
well /
She’s young—too young to leave ’er
muvver’s nest f”
“Orright, ole chook !” I nearly sez.. O ’ell /
And surely nobody unless he has
gun-plugs in his ears understands as
Australian “wiv,” “uwer,” “birf,” “bruv-
ver,” “worf.” The gum-tree they’re close
to grows in Bethnal Green.
Going back to it now at the luring
promptings of “Chis,” it’s a queer hybrid
of Cockney and Australian, this vocabu-
lary of “Den’s.” For there is, of course.
lashins of pure Australian all through it.
Not all of it in common usage today,
though not so remote yet as to be at all
unfamiliar. One day, though, the greater
part of it will be ; and if then “Den” still
lives it will be because of other qualities.
And the greatest of these, surely, is his
humor. And surely, too, that is as dis-
tinctly Australian as “wiv” and “birf”
and “uvver” are not. It jostles with
the sentimental in nearly every line
he wrote: a humor of total outlook on
life as well as of particular statement.
Digger Smith entertaining his hostess in
England:
“I’m gain’ on to talk uv kangaroos,
An’ ’ow I used to drive ’em four-in- and.
‘Wot?’ sez the Marchioness. ‘Them things in
zoos
That 'ops about? I’ve seen ’em in the Strand
In double ’arness; but I ain’t seen four.
Tell me some more.’ ”
Definitely it was that quality of humor
every bit as much as the sentimental one
which held the huge audience away back
there. Essentially it is the humor of that
levity which was the most common reac-
tion to and escape from its time of war
and world upheaval, but with enough of
the pure element of human comedy in it
for it to tickle the ribs just as thoroughly
today.
The fantastic sales of the Dennis books*
—so fantastic that every time they're set
down in print some poor wretch of a poet
goes out and hurls himself over the Gap ;
so, compassionately, they won’t be re-
pealed again here —were boosted by that
quality and quantity of humor. Then
there was the noted truth-to-label in senti-
mental being so much the right word for
it. Further, there was the natural human
story superlatively well told ; and there
were the novelty of it, the facility of
versifying and the felicity of rhyme that
make it as easy to read as anything ever
written.
All of these qualities “Chis,” taking
book by book of “Den,” looks into in the
course of sketching the life of the poet
from his boyhood days in South Ausr-
tralia to the end, A very interesting life,
too, for all the resemblance it bears —in
the way of struggle and unliterary lapses
and the like —to the lives of other Aus-
tralian writers. One day, tor a certainty
—if “Den” lives; and why shouldn’t he?
—this sketch will be the inspiration and
the basis of a completely rounded bio-
graphy or a biographical novel. It sets
a theme worth a novelist’s dramatising:
as a boy “Den” was brought up by
maiden aunts and turned out by them as
a Little Lord Fauntleroy, with the re-
action later on of his turning to glorify
the push. To present it sentimentally. To
overlook with a staggering blindness the
criminal in it. Even to romanticise its
very ugliness.
Only once in the long course of history
hds censor ever done author a good turn.
The chap with the blue pencil did that for
“Den.” Not intentionally, of course.
None the less, positively. On the ground
that it would be bad for morale or
recruiting, he suppressed from The Moods
of Ginger Mick “Den’s” glorifying of the
Battle 6f the Wazir. Hitherto known
to very few, it comes in as a tailpiece
to “Chis’s” book. The word for
emphasis is glorifying. To “Den,” who
wasn’t present, that was an occurrence
for hosannas:
If ole Pharaoh, King uv Egyp", 'ad been
t < gazin’ on the scene
d ’ave give the A.I.F. a narsty name
When they done their little best to scrub
’is dirty Kingdom clean
An’ to shift ’is ancient ’eap uv sin an’
shame.
To put it bluntly—in the very opposite
from what “Den” put it-—the Battle of
the Wazir was a crowd of well-trained,
men versus a pallid lot of women.
Harlots, to be sure. Women.
“Den” should have thanked that censor
to his last day. At the time he protested.
Even so, understandable enough. A
matter of the sentimental. “Den’s” in-
tentions were good. Whatever the objects
of his most genuine sentimental affection
did must be right.
What else? Well, there’s what the
critical call plagiarism, the partisans call
imitation, and the poets themselves call
legitimate usage. “Chis” recalls meeting
in The Bulletin office Louis Stone,
author of Jonah. No doubt fishing for
a bite —which he certainly got—he men-
tioned to Stone “the similarity of a certain
passage in Jonah and a verse in The
Sentimental Bloke'.” Bite coming up:
Schoolteacher Stone was a temperamental
fellow. His eyes flashed when 1 made the
question.
“I know,” he barked; “I know. That
man Dennis is a scoundrel. He has taken
his ideas from my book. I should like to
meet him and tell him what I think of
him.”
Whatever may be said of any lampoon
on the grandeur of the great —possibly
the most entertaining (and effective) of all
self-admissions of mediocrity- —there can’t
be any question about Bill and Doreen at
the performance of “Romeo and Juliet”
having a brilliant ending:
Then Juli-et wakes up an’ sees ’im there.
Turns on 'the water-works an’ tears ‘er ‘air:
“Dear love,’’ she sez, “I cannot live
alone I”
An/, wiv a moan,
She grabs ’is pocket-knife an’ ends ’er
cares . . .
‘‘Peanuts or lollies I” sez a boy upstairs.
Anyone with the time for a bit of
digging will come upon the genesis of it
in the writings of Westralian “Dryblower”
Murphy (there is also, of course, W. S.
Gilbert’s like lampooning of Ophelia’s
death). But, say the poets, that genesis,
like the Louis Stone original of the china
dogs on the mantelpiece, is in prose:
Dennis didn’t pinch; he transmuted —
after all, what was good enough for
Shakspeare to do with Plutarch and
others should have been good enough for
“Den” to do with “Dryblower” and
Louis.
Hands up all those in favor of the
poets! Good. It seems the poets have it
But hold! Also hist and hark. How
does “Den’s” famed “Australaise” go?:
Fellers of Australia',
Blokes and coves and coots.
Shift yer carcases.
Move yer boots.
Gird yer loins up.
Get yer gun,
Set the enermy
And watch the run.
Git a move on,
Have some sense.
Learn the art of
Self de- fence.
There once was a fellow named
Goodge, who wasn’t precisely a stooge
.. .or was he? :
He jumped across the horse
And cantered off, of course!
The roads were bad and muddy I
Said he: “Well, spare me days
The Government’s ways
Are screamin’ funny .
Say, easy on with the stones, boys!
What do you think you are . , . Ogs?
Which brings us undeviously into The
Glugs of Gosh and to. “Chis’s” most
marvellous interpretation thereof. The
Glugs, for the enlightenment of any who
may not have had the pleasure of reading
its mellifluous verse, is a satire on some-
thing—just what appears to be a very
open question. In present confessed
addict’s reading of it, it is a satire on Aus-
tralian examples of pompous authority
and lust for power and greed for gain
and other such human flaws and foibles.
But no, it seems not. The blurb on the
first edition’s dust-jacket said, with the
optimism common to blurbs:
Within a few months the word glug will
be in daily use among us, and wherever
our tongue is spoken “Ogs” (the Hun?'-
“Swanks” (Government officials) and ‘the
Lord High Stodge” (pompous authority'
will be household words.
We had one right, anyhow.
But hold your horses! And hold out
the stirrup, so that “Chis” can spring up
and view the landscape of Gosh with the
incontestably useful aid of hindsight:
As for the framework of The Glugs,
here the poet becomes revealed not only
as a sage observer of the human scene but
as a patriot and prophet; for, clearly, in
the episodes relating to the crafty Ogs ne
was warning his people of the danger in-
herent in buying baubles from Japan ano
selling to that country all the raw materials
it desired for the making of munitions.

THE DEVIL AND THE ANGEL (8).
There was this poet fellow in a garret,
And still it stirs my pity to remember
Bare boards, the cobwebs, and a crust of
bread,
The guttering candle with its wink of
light.
He turned his head a moment at our en-
trance,
Only a moment, and wrote on again.
“You come too soon,” he said, “I am not
ready.”
And still he wrote.
We stood there undecided;
I twitched “the Devil at his sleeve and
whispered;
“Comrade,” I said (a term of mere con-
vention),
“Shall we withdraw and talk this matter
over ?
“We snatch the fellow from his work un-
timely,
“See how his eyes take fire in the dark-
ness,
“I think he has some dream of death
upon him
“And hastes to glean his grain, but is not
done.”
He frowned. “ ’Tis best,” he said, “we
expedite it;
“There’s three score ten upon our list
to-morrow;
“Peru to Persia — one’s a Bishop, too,
“And that’s a lengthy business.
“Come, young man,
“There’s Heaven, there’s Hell. You know
them both. Which choose you ?
“We wait impatient on your quick deci-
sion” —
N.S.W.
And paced the hoards and swung his
whips of flame.
He bit his pen, looked up, then "Listen,"
said he,
"I’m on an epic here will live for ever;
“Wasting no words, it’s genius, that I’m
certain ;
“Leave me a year or so — I’ll put you in
it,
“Sketch in your portraits with some
strokes of greatness,
"A rhyme or two —a fine poetic image.
“What say you ?” I confess I straight-
ened somewhat
And smoothed my wings, then, guilty,
caught the Devil,
Cap cocked more jaunty, with some un-
concern
Striking an attitude against the doorway
(.Much like great Ccesar when we went to
fetch him, 0
But that’s another story.)
“Hold, hold,” the poet said, “Stand thus
a moment, .
“It wants a phrase here — there, that’s
your description
“Neatly wrote up against Eternity.
“Thanks, gentlemen, the door awaits be-
hind you ...
“Forgive me for not rising;
"I have an ode conceived that waits de-
livery.”
And thus we found ourselves upon the
doorstep
“Well !” said the Devil,
And “Well !” I said upon the self-
same instant.

(1) Some facts about arthritis and glaucoma?
(2) Would air travel be harmful to a person
with a strained heart?
The former is of rheumatic or uric acid
origin and largely affects subjects of this type.
There is usually an inherited trail, the trouble
appearing first in smaller joints as those of
the fingers, wrists and hands, and later knees
and arms are involved with swelling that retards
movement with pain. Heat will benefit, but
hot-air application by an amateur is not ad-
visable. Hot foments and hot baths will
enable massage or kneading to be given without
pain. Knead gently with an application ol
oil and methylated spirits, as this encourages
circulation about the joint, so that uric acid
accumulation and resulting swelling are reduced.
Glaucoma needs specialised treatment—an eye
doctor should be consulted. The eye trouble
is not directly connected with arthritis, although
pressure and restricted circulation of both blood
and aqueous fluid of the eye are related. (2)
Yes, as pressure is the main factor.

(1) From what Australian vineyards can the
best (a) sherry, ( b ) chablis, (c) claret, (d) hock
or similar wines be obtained? (2) What par-
ticular years have produced the best wines ?
(1) (a) Matter of opinion. Quality is improv-
ing, as the methods in use in Spain are followed
by those makers who place quality . before
quantity. The most consistent sherries pro-
duced come from the Watervale district in
S.A., where the varieties and soil and climatic
conditions are similar to those of Spain, and
where the wines are matured by the use of
the “Flor” culture system, (b) The Hunter
River white wines of New South Wales have an
outstanding chablis character, but the quantity
produced is limited, and so these vintages are
often blended with white wines from other
States. To obtain the best it is advisable to
stipulate that the chablis be an unblended pro-
duct of the district vineyards, (c) The lighter wines
of the Hunter River, N.S.W., are characteristic
of this type, but some excellent clarets arc
grown in S.A. from special vineyards which
nave a fair proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in
their- blends, (d) An outstanding hock is “Quell-
taler” (S.A.), while the Riesling wines from this
vineyard possess all the qualities of high-class
Rhine wines which are made from the Rhine
Riesling grape. Of late years the Rhine Ries-
lings produced in the vineyards of Eden Valley
(S.A.) have also made a name for themselves.
(2) Unlike the climatic conditions prevailing in
Europe, Australian vintages do not vary to
the same extent and so we have no years out-
standing over others.

(1) How many issues of stamps have there
been in NSW., Vic., SA., Tas., W.A.. Q.
and the Commonwealth ? (2) How many stamps
in a first-class collection?
(I) The numbers are N.S.W. 515, Vic. 730,
S.A. 487, Tas. 347, W.A. 200, Q. 350 and the
Commonwealth 352. (2) Numbers are not to
be taken into consideration when estimating
the value or importance of a first-class collec-
tion. Excluding varieties of watermark, per-
foration, etc., over 66,000 stamps have been
issued throughout the world.

(1) Some facts about various balloon ascents?
(2) Is it a fact that the closer one gets to the
sun, the smaller it gets and brilliance increases?
(1) In 1931 Professor Piccard reached a height
of 52,000 ft., and increased this to 54,120 ft. on
a second attempt in the following year. In
1933 two Russians reached 62,300 ft. and
Fordney and Settle (U.S.) 61,243 ft. The re-
ported height of 72,178 ft. was reached in 1934
by three Russians whose balloon fell to pieces.
A test sponsored by the National Geographic
Society and U.S. Army was carried out in the
same year, when Kepner, Stevens and Anderson
rose to a height of 62,100 ft. (2) The apparent
change of size of the sun at various elevations
is merely a phenomenon of perspective, while
the increased brilliance of the sun at high
altitudes is due to the fact that the incoming
radiation has not passed through the layer of
air containing water vapor and dust, thus not
reducing by absorbing and scattering the visible
(light) radiation.
* * * *
A method of ridding the haystack of rats?
If rat tunnels are noticed, calcium cyanide
(Cyanogas) is blown into the holes, which are
then closed up. The gas is very deadly to all
life and every precaution should be taxen with
it. Systematic trapping and poisoning will
considerably reduce the rat population, but
not eradicate it. As rats are so difficult to re-
move from haystacks, a farmer should ensure
that his stacks are made rat-proof on building.
* * * *
What are bouts-rimes, and can you furnish
an example ?
Addison described them as “lists of words
that rhyme to one another, drawn op by an-
other hand, and given to a poet, who has to
make a poem to the rhymes in the same order
that they were placed upon the list.” The more
odd and perplexing the rhymes are, the more
ingenuity is required to give a semblance of
commonsense to the production. As an instance,
the rhymes breeze, elephant, squeeze, pant, scant,
piease, hope, pope were submitted, and the fol-
lowing stanza was the result:
Escaping from the Indian breeze.
The vast, sententious elephant
Through groxes of sandal lo.es to squeeze
And in their fragrant shade to pant;
Although the shelter there be scant.
The xivid odors soothe and please.
And while he yields to dreams of hope.
Adoring beasts surround their pope.

Mr. H. D. Schroder, of
San Remo (Vic.), will
buy new boat for
nothing from proceeds
of unusual catch.
“Fishing’s hard work,” says Mr.
Schroder. “You’re out in all
weathers, and you don’t always get
amongst the fish. But I’ve dis-
covered another way to make
money. It provides a very handy
extra income, without work or
worry, and it’s absolutely certain!”
Born at Aalesund, Norway, Mr.
Schroder first came to Australia in
1912. In 1914, at the outbreak of
the Great War, he immediately
joined the Mercantile Marine, doing
his bit on the dangerous high seas
for his country of adoption.
Returning to Australia in 1917, he
sought wealth from the seas along
the Victorian coast—finally settling
at San Remo. He and his English-
born wife have two daughters—
both of whom have been recently
discharged from the W.A.A.A.P.
Bought Bonds
to Help Win War
Describing his money-making
plan, Mr. Schroder’s story really
starts in the early days of 1940.
“At the beginning of the war,”
he said, “I did what all good
Australians have done in-
vested every available penny I
could spare in War Loans to
assist the Government in its
drive against oppression.
“My native country had been
over-run by the Nazis, and I
knew only too well the fate in
store for Australia if the war-
mongering countries were not
halted in their tracks.”
Bonds Proved
Profitable Investment
Mr. Schroder worked hard, and
invested all the money he could
spare in Commonwealth Securities.
Now he finds that the money he
invested has mounted up amaz-
ingly. While doing his best to help
the war effort, he had also helped
himself —his Bonds had been earn-
ing better than bank interest all
the time.
May Buy New Boat from
Interest on Bonds
“You see that pretty little
packet there,” said Mr.
Schroder, pointing to his well-
kept 28-foot fishing boat, “well,
some day, with the interest my
Bonds have earned, I will have
two of them.
“And, by golly!” he added,
“I’ll get back all the money I
originally invested as well! It’s
a grand country!”
The Second Security Loan offi-
cially opens on October 15th.

She just sat down and refused to cook food.

‘‘We have done a lot ... to push forward
that reconversion of our economy which will
bring higher production . .
— Mr. Chifiey in the House of Representatives,
12171 ’46.
FACT
Wanton strikes cripple production, cause tragic
loss of coal, power, raw materials. Factories
forced to close, transport dislocated. The end
of the war took Labor by surprise . . . without
plans or preparations.
THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT will increase output, stimulate employment.
The Arbitration Court will be empowered to control the funds of any organisa-
tion (employers or employees) guilty of illegal strikes or lockouts, union officials
will be elected and major issues decided by secret ballot. Regular, well-paid work
will take the place of today’s uncertainty.
"Everything possible is being done by the
Government to expedite the construction of
houses.’
—Mr. Forde in the House of Representatives. 12171’46.
FACT
Federal control of housing in hopeless muddle.
Desperate home-seekers pay fantastic prices for
“keys.” Building costs soaring, homeless ex-
servicemen “squatting.” Housing schemes
held up.
THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT will make home building first priority. It will
abolish sales tax from materials and household fittings. Present bottlenecks wi
be broken by bringing sound business brains to work. Every encouragement will
be given to private builders, who have proved more efficient than cumbersome
Government housing authorities.
‘The Government is anxious to provide all
possible stimulus to reconversion which appro-
priate tax reductions can give.”
Mr Chifley in the House of Representatives,
12171 ’46.
FACT
Australians are heaviest taxed wage-earners in
the world. Taxation smothers incentive to work,
has depressing effect on production. Labor s
small, overdue tax cut made no real remission,
merely gave back some of the surplus taxation
revenue.
THF LIBERAL GOVERNMENT will cut income tax by a minimum of 20 p.c.
from January Ist , Realising that reduced imposts mean larger earnings and
buoyant markets, the Liberal Party will review sales tax, company tax and other
indirect levies. It promises genuine taxation relief.
“It has been our policy to remove all forms of
controls which tend to hinder genuine business
dealings and the production of essentials.
-Mr. Chifley in the Home of Representatives.
12171’46.
FACT
One-fourth of all Australian workers arc
Government employees. Administration costs
enormous, while top-heavy, overlapping Depart-
ments, created during war, still operate, still
use valuable office space.
THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT will comb
or government for which he has to pay.

TO COMMAND THE EATS
BY GEOFF BINGHAM
Denny met
Morgan Todds
in the railway
waiting - room
at Snowy Vale.
“Gentlemen’s Waiting-
Room,” the notice
said outside, and
Denny thought it was
the first time he had
seen a notice like
that.
When he entered
the room it was cold,
and just before midnight. There were six
servicemen and ex-servicemen. Some
wore their jungle greens without color-
patches, and all were shut in thick great-
coats, shivering as Denny himself, al-
though it was not quite winter. Morgan
Todds was in contrast, being a small
figure, clothed in shiny black, and
huddled upon a waiting-room chair. He
looked at Denny when he walked in, then,
with a shiver, tried to withdraw into his
black.
Denny did not know him as Morgan
Todds, ringmaster of the circus camped
beside the station, and so he did not
speak to him. Morgan Todds did not
speak either. Some of the servicemen
were talking, and one was saying how he
had managed two hundred rabbits in two
days; how he had a good bait and
guaranteed. There was a glowing from
the fires of the circus, but in the waiting-
room there was no fire, until one of the
men said he would “scrounge” some coals,
and in a few minutes he was back with
five coals on a shovel, glittering and
spluttering with good red heat.
Morgan Todds spoke to Denny. “You
take a seat here,” he said. “It’s not far
from the fire.”
The grate was cluttered with last year’s
ashes, and the hot coals began to die.
“You want timber on that,” said
Morgan Todds. “Go down to the circus
lines there, and tell ’em Morgan Todds
sent you. They’ll give you some deal.”
He stared down at his hands. “I’d go
myself only for this hand,” he said.
Denny looked at the smallish man.
He could see that the circus man was no
chicken to be a ringmaster, and that al-
though his body was small there was
strength in the man. It showed on the
firm patient face, and on the uncovered
reddish hand. The other hand was ban-
daged, and the bandage was a little old,
slightly soiled.
They brought the timber back, and it
cracked and exploded in the large waiting-
room. The soldiers were talking about
Nips, and one said he had been a prisoner
under them for a day. Morgan Todds
looked at the soldiers talking, and leaned
across to Denny.
“It’s going to be colder than this,” he
said.
Denny nodded, recognising the urge
for conversation. He shifted closer to the
circus man, and then looked down at the
bandaged hand.
“The cats,” said the man in black.
“You call ’em lions, but we call ’em cats,
mostly.”
“It’s the little ’uns,” he said, “that are
no trouble. The big ’uns that are the
trouble.” He pointed down to the circus.
“I’m ringmaster there,” he said. “I’m
Morgan Todds. I command the cats.”
“Pretty tough cats,” said one of the
servicemen,
“Old Gouger got me,” said Morgan
Todds, “and he’s a nasty piece of work.”
Denny spoke for the first time. “It
must take guts,” he said.
The ringmaster shook his head. “It
isn’t guts,” he said. “It’s patience. 1
don’t rightly kndw what guts is.”
“I saw the little yellow runt in the
tree,” a soldier was saying. “He had no
gun, not even a grenade, and as I was
going to shoot him he starts screaming
for mercy. ‘Come down, you runt,’ 1
says, but he didn’t, and then he starts
gettin’ cocky, shoutin’ ‘Banzai! Banzai!’
but 1 soon put a stop to that.”
don’t rightly know what guts is,”
' Morgan Todds was repeating in an
even voice. “It’s just that you get to
command the cats, and they obey you.
Some can, and some can’t. Take ‘Pussy-
foot’ Deakin, now. He’s a woman, he
is. Comes into me one night when I’m
training them. I’d just shut them Up.
‘lt’s the ambition of my life,’ he says.
“‘What’s the ambition of your life?’
I says,
“To command the cats,’ he says.
‘That’s my ambition.’
“ ‘Well, command ’em,’ I says, and I
chucks him the whip.
“ ‘No,’ he says, alarmed like. ‘No,
don’t go. I don’t think I could do it.
I don’t, really. It’s just that I’d like to.’
“ ‘lt’s just that you’d like to,’ 1 mimics.
‘lt’s just that you’d like to.’
“1 go to let the cats into the ring, but
Deakin slips outside and he’s plain
scared. Me? I’m
wild by now, that
sissy thinkin’ he c’n
do what I’m doing.
“‘You’d like -to
command the cats,
eh?’ I says. Then I
opened the cages,
and out they came.
I can tell you by this
time I am roaring
wild, which is a bad
way to be when the
cats are loose, be-
cause they know,
bein’ sensitive to at-
mosphere.
“ ‘Come on, Jesse,’
I says, and I opens the first cage. ‘Come
on, Pouncer,’ I says, and I opens the
second cage. ‘Out, ’Polio,’ I says, and
then I open the cage for Gouger, and
he’s the biggest cat and the wildest. The
others I have reared from cubs, but he
only came to us last year, and a trouble
he’s been. ‘Out, Gouger,’ I says, and
Gouger comes bounding across, his eyes
yellower than his hair.
“Deakin is white now. ‘Put ’em back,
Mr. Todds,’ he says ; ‘put ’em back.’
“ ‘Come and command them,’ I says.
Then I begin to yell, and crack the whip
so that the cats are
runnih’, threadin’ in
and out and begin-
nin’ to snarl.
“ T don’t reckon I
can,’ he says.
‘ ’Course you can’t,’
I says. ‘What about
your life’s ambi-
tion?’ '
“Deakin is close
t to shiverin’ now. I’m
yellin’ and crackin’ the whip. Gouger
is cornin’ at me all the time, but the
other cats are keepin’ back.
“ ‘You want to wear gold braid and
ribbon,’ I says to Deakin, but I’m not
looking at him. ‘You want red color
slashed through your strides. Why don’t
you get a job as the man outside Hoyts?’
1 says, and I cracks the whip so that the
cats are snarlin’ fearful.
“‘Stop it,’ Deakin says. ‘They’ll get
you, Morgan.’
“1 saw they were gettin’ restless, and
Gouger in particular, so I pushed ’em
back. Jesse and ’Polio and Pouncer
were easy. I slammed the doors after
they went in, and locked them.
“ ‘Up, Gouger,’ I says, ‘Back, Gouger,’
but he was restless. He almost gets to
the cage when he turns. ‘ln you go,’ I
tells him, but he goes in backing, which
is bad.
“‘Get in, you yellow rogue!’ I says,
and cracks the whip. When I get him in
I slam the door and go to fasten it.
That was when he got me, and in half a
minute my hand is a hot, bloody mass,
ribbons you might say.
“ ‘Deakin,’ I yells, but Deakin don’t
answer, and when I look around he’s
fainted. ‘Ruddy sis,’ I says, but others
are coming. In the hospital the doc, says
the hand will have to come off.”
The smallish man in the worn black
clothes was not even excited. His voice
was a steady even monotone. The six
soldiers and Denny were staring at him
and the bandaged hand.
“ ‘Take that off. Doc.?’ I says, ‘Don’t
be mad. I need that hand.’
“ ‘You’ll never tame lions again,’ he
says.
“ ‘I don’t tame ’em,’ I says, T command
’em, and I need my hand for that, which
means you don’t take it off.’
“The doc. shakes his head. ‘lt’s got to
come off,’ he says. ‘lt’s ripped something
terrible.’
“ ‘Ripped or not, it stays on,’ I says.
“They didn’t take it off, and after a
few weeks the doo. says maybe a skin
graft will do. After the graft I went
back to the circus, but no one’s been
near the cats except to feed ’em, and
Gouger is too big and fat for my liking,
although some will tell you they’re better
when they’re well fed, which is only
partly true. Gouger looks at me, cun-
ning and knowing as any cat. He just
looks nasty at me. I have to go on with
the act, you know.”
One of the soldiers offered Morgan
Todds a cigarette, which he took without
appearing glad. He
lit it and seemed, dis-
inclined to say more.
“I T must take
1 guts, this lion
business,” said a
soldier.
“Not guts,” said
Morgan Todds;
“patience.” He sat*
awhile, and then
pointed to the
camped circus.
There was no move-
ment in the whole
camp except for the
flicker of golden
fires. “Just listen,” he said, “and you’ll
hear them grunt.”
They waited until a lion grunted and
another coughed and growled.
“Sounds terrible to you,” said Morgan
Todds, “but it’s nothing to me, because
I’m used to it. They require patience and
understanding, that’s all. Some say you
need guts, but, then, what is guts? I
don’t rightly know.
“I knew a doctor who hkd guts,” he
went on. “He was our M.O. in France
in ’eighteen. I was in the Flying Corps
then, a pilot, when flying wasn’t fancy
like it is now. We went up in those
days first with .45 Colts and later an
m.-g. strapped on, but any bombs you
dropped was over the side. Those were
the early days, and you might say a
’plane wasn’t much use like they are to-
day, if you call that sort of thing being
useful.
“Our job was mainly shooting Jerries
out of the sky, and that was their job,
too, so there was fun for all. I scored
eleven Jerries before they got me, and
then I didn’t know it. I woke up to find
myself in .base hospital and our own unit
M.O. specially come back to look after
me,
“ ‘We’ll get you well, Todds,’ he says,
‘you’re a good pilot.’
, “They did, too, because they had the
best man possible on the job, a Hun
prisoner-of-war. The M.O. tells me
about it, and if there is anything our
M.O. hated it was Huns.
“‘I hate ’em, Todds,’ he says. T hate
’em, but he’s the only man that can fix
you. He says he will have you flying in
six weeks. I believe he will, too, but I
hate him all the same, because he’s a
Hun.’
“He had me fixed in about six weeks,
too, and there is a plate in my head. The
day I’m due to fly the M.O. brings the
Jerry surgeon along with him and they
watch me go up. When I come down
again the M.O, is there with the Hun
M.O. Our doc. is white, but congratu-
lates me, ‘Pretty good, Todds,’ he says,
‘and the Hun did it all right.’
“He went over to the Hun, then, and
he goes to put out his hand. I never
thought he could do it, even though that
Hun had operated and given me back
half a head as you might say. When
they got me my brains were half out.
You could see them pumping, they told
me. That’s why I thought a lot of our
M.O. as he goes to shake hands with the
Hun. Then our
M.O. pulls back his
hand as though he
can’t do it after
all, and the Jerry is
looking at him,
puzzled. At last the
M.O. shakes hands
with him, and the
Jerry is beaming all
over his face. I
reckon that is guts.
“ ‘That takes guts,’ I says to the M.O.
“ ‘l’ll never get my hand clean for
weeks,’ the M.O. says.”
Morgan Todds looked at Denny and
the soldiers, “That’s guts for you,” he
said.
The soldiers nodded.
“I’ve still got the plate there,” said
the circus man. He tapped the crown
of his head. There may or may not
have been a plate
there, for all anybody
knew.
“So the hand still
isn’t healed?” said
Denny, The soldiers
looked at the band-
age.
The small man said
nothing. He was
taking a bottle from
one pocket with his
good hand. He un-
sioppered the bottle
and began pouring a pale yellow liquid
over the bandage, so that the fluid
soaked through the cloth. “Acriflavin,”
he explained. “Keeps it clean.” He put
the bottle away.
Denny looked at his watch and saw
there was an hour to go before the Syd-
ney train arrived. The room was just
beginning to warm.
ii'T'HIS is a new wound,” said Morgan
1 Todds. There was no expression
in his voice, no pride or impatience.
“Gouger got me again the night before
last. He’s had it in for me ever since
the day Deakin did
his fancy prancin’ in
front of the cages,
and he was able to
rip my hand.
“I’d watched that
cat, because in forty
years no cat has got
me beyond a scratch.
It’s not that I’m los-
ing my nerve, be-
cause nerve isn’t in
it. It’s patience you
need, and that cat’s wearing down my
patience. He knew he had to make me
wild to get me off my guard, but I was
watching.
“‘You don’t get me goin’, Gouger,’
I says, T’ve patience enough for you.’
That isn’t strictly true, because I’m tired
of the game—‘browned off’ as you might
say; ‘had it,’ as they say in the
Army.
“Gouger’s waiting for me to change
my tactics, but I take him through every
night the same. ‘Up, Gouger,’ I says.
‘Down, Gouger,’ I says. ‘Back, boy,’ I
says, and it is after that he lashed at me.
Thought he had me then, but quick as
lightning I switch the whip across and
in two jiffs I have him in the cage, and
both he and me are surprised.
“‘You big yeller cat,’ I says, ‘you’re
in there again.’
“Gouger glares at me, but he knows
he’s beaten for the time. We’re both
wonderin’ about next time.”
Morgan Todds had finished his cigar-
ette and was huddled into a dark sombre
shape upon his chair.
“To-night,” he went on, “I had the
cats out, and there was something dif-
ferent about everything. The crowds
roared as they always do, and they were
just faces, white patches that blurred
when you glanced up, and the cats were
there, roaring and growling, so that the
crowd was scared and liking it, and I
wasn’t scared and still not liking it. I
was tired, I tell you, and I knew the
cats was watching me. I played with the
other cats, and then let Gouger out. I
knew he couldn’t break my patience, not
when I was tired like I was.
“When he came out he was growling
and prowling, and I whipped the other
cats back, and played with him. Then
he smelt the blood beneath the bandage,
and he kept getting worked up, and all
the time I knew he might do something
he’d never done before. You can’t
fathom cats when there’s the smell of
blood, and it’s your blood. He keeps
edging near me, but he knows I’m not
flustered but that I’m tired enough to
watch every move, and never lose me
block.
“His eyes are glaring yellow, and his
big head has the hair standing round
it like a halo from hell. After that I
put him back into the cage, and he goes,
hatin’ it, and me, but goin’ back never-
theless. Yes, he went back.”
Morgan Todds diminished, and was
only a small tired man upon a waiting-
room chair. One hand held the other
bandaged one. The fire began to sink
in the room, and Denny knew the train
would be in soon.
“Forty years I’ve had,” said Morgan
Todds, “forty years, and it’s too much
for a man. I’m gettin’ out of the game,
soon as I can. I shouldn’t be surprised
how soon.”
He looked at the six soldiers and
Denny. “No,” he said. “I shouldn’t be
surprised how soon. 1 might even leave
to-night, and never come back.”

UNCABLED ADDITIONS
PROBLEMS FOR POLAND.
Poland is to have the elections called
for by the agreements at Yalta and Pots-
dam sometime in November, but already
doubts as to whether they will be “free
and unfettered” have led to Britain’s
sending a warning Note to the Polish pro-
visional Government.
There have been ugly rumors about
the conduct of the June referendum
which the Government viewed “both as
a step toward and as ersatz for the elec-
tions.” The British Note said that “it is
stated that leading supporters of the
Polish Peasant party, which is legally en-
titled to exist and to conduct political
activities, were arrested shortly before
the referendum,” and further that “the
count was interfered with after the re-
moval of ballot boxes from the polling
places.” It asked again that the Ambas-
sador be given the text of the electoral
law so that “His Majesty’s Government
may consider whether there are points in
it on which they would wish to offer
observations.”
The Communist president, Boleslaw
Bierut, replied tartly that his Govern-
ment was “not bound to do anything
more than pledge itself to the holding of
elections. There is no provision whatever
for outside supervision of Polish electoral
law or of Polish party politics, and the
request in the British Note, to supervise
or express opinion on the electoral law,
constitutes open interference with com-
pletely internal party politics in Poland.”
The Bierut party is anxious to make of
the elections a single-ticket affair after
the Russian pattern, without any con-
tests. And there is a suspicion that what-
ever happens the elections will result in
civil war. W. H. Lawrence, writing to
N.Y. “Times,” has reported on “concern
over the possibility of civil war promotion
by Left or Right Wing elements, depend-
ing on which way the elections turn out,”
he says, “this certainly would be followed
by Soviet military intervention.”
In a picture of the present state of the
country in the “Saturday Evening Post”
Edmund Stevens says that “Poland is in a
fair way of becoming Europe’s worst
danger spot. Internal disorders whose
underground roots extend beyond
Poland’s frontiers convulse the country’s
daily life, impeding the process of econo-
mic and political recovery. Not a day
goes by without some new outrage or
act of political terrorism. Many of these
acts are directed against the Russians,
whose lines of communication with their
occupation zone in Germany run across
Poland. Red Army casualties in Poland
along the communication lines exceed
those sustained in Germany in the course
of occupation duties. Train-wrecking
techniques perfected against the Germans
are now employed against the Russians.
The fires of unrest are fed by the des-
perate economic situation. Arm in arm
with the terrorists, black famine stalks
the land.”
Stevens reports on the political align-
ment of parties:
“The two main parties supporting the
present regime are P.P.R., or Polish
Workers’ party, Communist-sponsored,
and P.P.S., or Polish Socialist party, in
reality the left wing of the pre-war Polish
Socialist party. The Communists are led
by President Boleslaw Bierut and Vice
Premier Gomulka; the Socialists by
Premier Edouard Osobka-Morawski.
The strongest legal opposition party is
P.S.L. —the Polish Peasant party, led by
Stanislaw Mikolajczyk, former Premier
of the London Polish Government. The
fact that Mikolajczyk is formally a mem-
ber of the Government does not alter his
position as the main standard-bearer for
the opposition,
“For support, both Communists and
Socialists look chiefly to the factory
workers of Warsaw and Lodz, the Silesian
coalminers and other labor elements.
Poland is still overwhelmingly a peasant
country, and the number of industrial
workers probably doesn’t exceed
1,600,000. Allowing four members to a
worker’s family, they still comprise little
more than a quarter of Poland’s esti-
mated population of 25,000,000. This
was the calculation whereon Mikolajczyk
based his demand of 75 per cent, of the
seats in the Diet as the condition for
bringing his Peasant party into the Gov-
ernment’s single-ticket bloc,
“Government leaders claim that the
enemies of the present Administration
plan to use Mikolajczyk to destroy the
regime. They further accuse Mikolaj-
czyk of allowing himself to be used in
this fashion.” Stevens says that “the
Russians watch these events with
deep concern. They feel that an electoral
majority for Mikolajczyk would upset
the rather precariously maintained pro-
Soviet orientation. In Russian eyes,
Mikolajczyk, in the days of his Premier-
ship in the London Government, served
as a front for bitterly anti-Soviet ele-
ments. They suspect he might revert to
that role, especially since anti-Russian
feeling has deep historical roots in
Poland. The return to power of anti-
Soviet elements would, in Russian eyes,
be the equivalent of a military disaster
cancelling out the gains from the military
victory over Germany.”
It is for such reasons the N.Y. “Times”
believes that civil war is brewing.
“Peasant party leaders are confident that
they would get an overwhelming majority
if the vote should be free and the count-
ing honest. They are not too sure, how-
ever, that the Left-Wing parties would
submit to such a result, and this might
produce civil war.
“It is said that Soviet leaders have
served notice that they would have no
confidence in a Mikolajczyk regime. And
when Moscow declares ‘no confidence’
in a Government within the ‘security belt,’
past performance would indicate that that
Government must sooner or later topple,
either peacefully or by other means. Ex-
pressions of Russian disapproval for a
Government headed by Mikolajczyk might
be the signal for a Leftist uprising. If he
were to win the election, then that almost
certainly would be followed by Russian
military intervention on the excuse that
she must protect and have order on her
line of communications to Germany.
“If there is no civil war and the Russians
do not intervene, there is an equally
grave prospect for Poland that the Krem-
lin may recast its foreign policy and
plump for a strong; Soviet-dominated
German State with a weak Poland be-
tween. That is the course of action
that German Communists are trying to
sell to Premier Stalin.”
Russian position and influence in the
country have caused a great deal of com-
ment in the U.S. George E. Sokolsky
in the N.Y. “Sun” was caustic and bitter:
“Poland is a small country that makes
a big noise. Its significance in the past
has been that it was the outpost of
Western civilisation in the Eastern world.
At Warsaw, Europe ended culturally and
spiritually ; Asia began. Today, this role
has been reversed. Poland has become an
Asiatic bulwark, the ramrod, as it were,
of Soviet Russia in Europe.
“Poland is moving East with apparent
willingness. Russia has taken control
of the Government, which it has
reduced to a puppet, Poland has
been stultified into an arm of the
Soviet Foreign Office, doing its bid-
ding slavishly, permitting itself to be
represented in international councils by
the renegade American citizen Oscar
Lange, who plays the Russian tune when-
ever Gromyko grows weary of it. It is
a negative, nihilistic tune, cynical, ugly.
like a horrible pagan god out of Asia.
It is a sorry spectacle for the cpuntry
that produced Ignace Paderewski after
the last war. Then Poland was proud of
international approval; today Poland is
the most contemptible among nations —a
thing used, a parrot without a character
or mind of its own. It is a horrible spec-
tacle, like a beautiful girl forced on the
streets by a brutal fiend.”
London “Times” takes a somewhat
happier view of the future of the coun-
try. A correspondent reported on “en-
couraging signs of recovery and new
growth.” He found “plenty of evidence
that Poland’s future would be bright if she
could subdue or circumvent the two chief
dragons in her path—food shortage and
political unrest.
“The food shortage is both more
critical and less exciting as a topic
•for discussion than politics. Out-
right famine in the towns, impend-
ing since early March, has been
prevented just in time by the arrival
of U.N.R.R.A. supplies. The grain
harvest was less than half of
pre-war. The worst feature has
been the paralysis of agriculture in the
former German territories, where the
effect of devastation, looting, and defi-
ciencies of manpower, horses, seeds and
fertilisers has been that less than 20 per
cent, of the pre-war crops was harvested.
Livestock numbers have been drasti-
cally reduced. Horses and oxen are less
than half their pre-war number, and
without outside assistance it will take a
generation to restore them. Cattle are
less than 40 per cent, of pre-war, and pig
numbers are down to 23 per cent.
“Nationalisation of mining, iron and
steel and of nearly all factories employ-
ing more than 50 workers has been car-
ried through and accepted as common
ground by all parties. Output a man-
hour is lower than before the war, owing
partly to insufficient food and clothing,
partly to absenteeism and to the necessity
of searching for food, but mainly to the
lack of skilled workers. Thousands
were killed or taken to Germany, and few
or no new recruits were trained during
the war.”
NO PEACE FOR AUSTRIA.
There are some glaring omissions from
the agenda for the Paris “Peace” Con-
ference. Austria is one of them. And if
the holding of a “Peace” conference
without any discussion of a treaty for
Germany is somewhat akin to an attempt
to stage “Hamlet” without the Prince of
Denmark, then the overlooking of
Austria is very much like a projected
“Macbeth” without that unhappy war-
rior’s bloody lady. John McCormac,
writing in the N.Y. “Times,” puts it that
“without Austria there can be no peace.”
He goes on to explain that “until
Austria gets her treaty Russia will keep
an army there. As long as she has an
army in Austria she can plead—and has
made it clear that she intends to do so —
that she must keep lines of communica-
tion and thus more soldiers in Hungary
and Rumania. No treaty with those coun-
tries that leaves Russian troops in occu-
pation will bring peace except on paper.
Russia’s refusal to discuss a treaty with
Austria, therefore, meant that her pro-
gress along the road to peace was to be
one that put the cart before the horse.”
As McCormac sees it, Austria holds a
key position in Central Europe. “Liter-
ally and figuratively, Austria is the front-
line of peace. Rumania, Bulgaria, Yugo-
slavia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia
were given away to Russia at Yalta.
There they were acknowledged to be in
Russia’s political sphere. Their economic
domination by Moscow was assured at
Potsdam when that famous agreement
granted to Russia ‘German assets’ in
Rumania, Bulgaria and Hungary.
“Austria, however, was not placed in
the Russian sphere of influence. Austria,
it was decided in Moscow in 1943, was to
be restored to her independent position
in the heart of Europe. Since she had
been forcibly annexed by Germany, she
was to have the status of a liberated
country.”
The position now is that the “liberated”
Austria finds herself in worse case than
the conquered Hungary, Rumania and
Bulgaria. “They will have peace and
sovereignty of a kind and she will have
neither.
“Russia obviously has changed her
mind about Austria. Perhaps she had
hoped for an ideological foothold here.
Instead, Austria is still a country where
socialism is strong, but, being strong, re-
mains the rival of Communism instead of
its tool and ally.”
The decision for “liberation” rather
than a conquering has not pleased the
Austrians. “Today six and a half million
Austrians are tasting the full bitterness of
disillusionment,” says Edward P, Morgan
in “Collier’s”; “Forlorn Viennese observe
wryly that they might be able to stand
another war but never another liberation,
“Instead of being free, Austria is
cracked up into four parts controlled by
the Russians, Americans, British and
French. The Austrians will tell you that
the occupying Powers are more preoccu-
pied with watching one another than with
the welfare of Austria and that the nation
has become a battleground of power
politics between Russia and the West,
“The Americans and British accuse the
Russians of trying to puli Austria com-
“If you’re a citizen, native-born or
naturalised, of the United States, can you
be a Communist without breaking the
laws of the land ?”
The answer is that membership in
the Communist party is a violation of
the laws of this Republic. The law is
that anyone who lines up with the Com-
munists in the United States in this
present era —when we’re still technically
at war—is a candidate for a firing squad.
Fellow-travellers, members of pinko
organisations ( native-born Reds with a
streak of yellow), are marked down as
criminal accomplices. They are subject
under the law to the same punishment of
death in war-time.
Any foreigner who happens to land in
the U.S. and who becomes a Communist
is. according to the present ruling of the
Department of Justice, marked down as a
political foe and must be deported. Mem-
bership in the Communist party, agree-
ment with its aims, is by itself cause for
arrest and deportation. This interpreta-
tion was laid down under the Roosevelt
regime when then Attorney-General
Francis Biddle, with the White House
0.K., declared that membership in the
Communist party was of itself evidence
of the intent to engage in a conspiracy
to overthrow the Government of the
United States. That still stands on the
books. —John O’Donnell, in N.Y. “Daily
News.”
pletely into the Soviet orbit under the
guise of collecting reparations. The Rus-
sians repeat they want only security and
friends. Their Western allies counter
with the question: How far from home
must you push your lines of defence be-
fore you consider the Soviet Union
secure?”
The Russians wish to incorporate
Austria in a Danube bloc under Russian
domination. “In their economic claims,”
says Morgan, “they contend they are
merely exercising the legal rights con-
ceded them at Potsdam. In their re-
fusal to reduce occupation forces they
stress that they cannot trust the present
Government with the job of denazifica-
tion. The Austrians remark that the
Russians lost faith’ in the Government

There has been conflict of opinion
over the Russian seizure of Austrian in-
dustry, in particular the Zisterdorf oil
fields. Morgan blames a misunderstand-
ing of the agreement at Potsaam: “There
the British and Americans specifically re-
nounced all claims to ‘German external
assets’ in eastern Austria, where almost
all Austria’s industrial wealth lies.
Eastern Austria is the Russian zone, and
Russians seized upon the implication mat
these German assets were for them.
But what a ‘German external asset’ is
Potsdam didn’t say. The Russians con-
veniently assumed this meant everything
in German hands when the war ended.
“The Russians have no intention of
carting all their reparations home. They
are interested in doing business with
Youth movements are an old evil in
Europe. The subordination of young
people to an idea, to a political party
or to the State is one of the most
repellent features of modern collectivism,
whether it he Socialist, Communist,
Fascist or National Socialist. It is
inimical to the wayward and elusive spirit
of youth, which needs free, and not
forced, companionship, which must at
times have solitude, be shy or too Self-
assured. too forward, sometimes, or
awkward. Youth movements are de-
structive of all inwardness. Much of
the evil of our day has its origin in the
corruption of youth by the State, or by
political movements which aspire to
become the State, or by the idea of
which a future State is to be trip em-
bodiment, — F. A. Voigt in the “Nine-
teenth Century.”
Austrians. On oil, for instance, they
proposed to form a new company and
go ‘5O-50’ with the Austrian Govern-
ment. The ratio, according to the
Austrian version, would be more like 50
kilos to 50 grams: the Russians would
furnish the manager and some equip-
ment and the Austrians would furnish
capital. In return they would get a
questionable half interest in an enter-
prise they considered theirs in the first
place.”
Morgan says that the average Austrian
seems little interested in all these ques-
tions. Certainly, in the economic condi-
tion of the country, the Austrian has a
more immediate and pressing problem for
consideration. A London ‘‘Times” corre-
spondent has declared that “it means
disaster if a decision is not soon reached
on the way Austria as a whole can be
kept alive. Briefly the question is what
will happen when U.N.R.R.A. with-
draws. Although there have been plenty
of gibes about U.N.R.R.A., it has cer-
tainly saved Vienna and the larger towns
from starvation.
“Austria,” he pointed out, “has always
been a food-importing country. It
is calculated that she. will not have
enough food from her own resources to
feed herself for more than five months in
the coming year.
“There have been rumors of American
or British loans or credits. It has been
said that in order to keep going Austria
will need about £30,000,000 for each of
the next two years. It seems unlikely at
present that any Western Power will
commit itself so heavily so long as it
does not feel certain that the benefits will
go solely to the Austrians.”
There is the necessity for stabilisation
of currency, but in the “Times” man’s
view “this will be difficult to achieve so
long as occupation costs, the greater part
of which is the Russian share, continue
to take 35 per cent, of the Austrian
Budget.”
Still, he thinks “it should be added that
there is danger that an analysis of this
kind plays up to the Austrian tactics of
rousing excessive pity for themselves.
Whatever their lack of food and adminis-
trations and other excuses they could
have done a great deal more themselves.
The distribution of food could be far
more efficient. There have been examples
where some of the extremely scarce
materials for export have been sent abroad
in exchange for things quite worthless to
Austria in her present state. In general
it is fair to say that the country has not
had much luck, but has not shown much
energy.”
Greek Fears and Problems.
King George II of Greece returns to
a country confused and troubled. Greece
is only now finding a way to reorganise
her economy, which was “dislocated by
three invaddrs vying with each other in
ruthlessness Germans, Italians and
Bulgarians—by the systematic plundering
of Greek resources for three years to
supply the Axis North African campaign
and finally by a cruel civil war.” She has
had to face afresh a complaint launched
against her in U.N.0., and she keeps a
fearful eye to the north watching the
Balkan manoeuvrings of the Russian-
dominated “Yugoslav group” of nations.
The Ukrainian complaint alleged that
Greece was - responsible for the unrest
in the Balkans, which constitutes a threat
to peace and security, but London
“Times” commented that there were vari-
ous other reasons for the Soviet groups
raising the issue;
“There is the immediate and obvious
motive of countering the case against
Albania, between which country and
Greece a state of war still exists. There
is the additional consideration that if the
present Greek Government can be
arraigned before the Security Council its
claims for frontier rectifications with
Albania and Bulgaria may be prejudiced.”
—London “Daily Mail...”
TROUBLE AT THE PARIS RACETRACK.
And “in some quarters it is thought the
Ukrainian action is a rejoinder to the
United States threat to have the .Yugo-
slav incident brought before the Security
Council. The wider issue, however, is
the bringing of Greece within the Russian
zone and the elimination of British power
and prestige in the Balkans.”
But there is no doubt that Greece her-
self is fearful. A. C. Sedgwick, writing in
the N.Y. “Times,” says that “a fear of
neighbors, openly unfriendly and secretly
warlike, dominates the Greek scene. The
Greeks suspect that these neighbors,
bound together by pacts of friendship and
by common ideology depending on
Moscow, may count upon internal Left-
wing elements to work deliberately or
otherwise for the eventual foreign occu-
pation of Greece. This fear accounts for
the heightened consciousness of Hellen-
ism and a hardening of self-defensive
nationalism. It is an explanation of the
trend in favor of the King’s return, which
the Republicans deplore less than they
formerly did. It is responsible for the
atmosphere of anxiety that retards the
nation’s return to normality.”
Too, Sedgwick thinks “the friendship
pact between Albania and Yugoslavia
may bring forth dire consequences as far
as Greece is concerned. Moreover,
rapprochement is steadily growing be-
tween those two Powers and Bulgaria, an
ancient foe of Greece.
“Albanian Army regulars have taken
part in attacks on frontier posts. Work-
ing in concert with them in assaults upon
gendarmerie stations, barracks and the
homes of leading citizens, Albanian irre-
gulars* have co-operated with Bulgarian
and Yugoslav guerrillas, Macedonian
autonomists and home-grown Com-
munists in a co-ordinated effort to under-
mine the State’s authority. The avowed
aim is incorporation of Greek Macedonia,
called /Egean Macedonia by Marshal
Tito, into the Yugoslav federation. This
province is Greece’s breadbasket. Its
loss would spell the nation’s death
through starvation.”
The uneasiness about the political
future of the country does not help in
economic reconstruction, though a
London “Times” observer found “signs of
general improvement.”
“The main reason for optimism is the
excellence of the harvest, which reached
the almost record figure of 700,000 tons.
This is partly due to clement weather and
to the help provided by U.N.R.R.A.,
especially in tractors; but tribute should
be paid to the Greek peasants, who, work-
ing under conditions of appalling hard-
ship, set themselves the task of rehabili-
tating their country. It should be remem-
bered that about 400,000 of these peasants
were living in caves or temporary shelters,
that fertilisers and tools were scarce, and
that only about five per cent, of the
300,000 horses, 100,000 donkeys and
400,000-head of horned cattle lost during
the occupation have so far been replaced.
“Even in normal times Greece had al-
ways to import more than she was able
to export. Representatives of the United
Nations estimated that Greece must every
year import a third of her food require-
ments. This trade deficit was counter-
balanced before the war by invisible
sources of revenue such as shipping, the
tourist trade and remittances from
Greek nationals living abroad. About
80 per cent, of the Greek mercantile
marine was destroyed during the war and
has not yet been replaced. With passport
and exchange restrictions tourist traffic
on a large scale is out of the question.
By necessity or taste the Greek has al-
ways sought fortune in wealthier coun-
tries than his own, principally Russia,
Turkey, Egypt and the United States.
Emigration to those countries is now al-
most impossible, and this will sooner or
later raise an acute demographic problem.
For many years emigration will con-
tinue to be one of the main and charac-
teristic aspects of Greek national
economy.”
The correspondent concludes that
“Greek financial and economic recovery
cannot be complete and lasting unless
means are devised to repair as quickly as
possible the havoc wrought by four years
of foreign occupation. During that period
90 per cent, of port facilities, 95 per cent,
of the railways and about 25 per cent,
of housing were destroyed. The total
damage sustained by Greece under those
heads has been estimated at about
£1,440,000,000. Greece possesses neither
the financial resources nor the equipment
for carrying out reconstruction work of
this magnitude.”

Russia stands like a colossus across two
continents. She has new frontiers on the Elbe
and the Adriatic on the west and in the Kuriles
on the east. She is plashing southward toward
the Dai dandles and the Mediterranean in
Europe; toward the north-eastern provinces of
Turkey and Iran in the Middle East, toward
Afghanistan and Sinkiang in central Asia, and
deep into China and Korea. In land mass
the new Red empire is the greatest the wmld
has ever .known. This expansion is disguised
under various fictions. Soviet rule in eastern
Germany and Austiia is supposed to be merely
for purposes of temporary occupation and
administration. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hun-
gary, Yugoslavia, Rumania and Bulgaria are
nominally independent States. All are effec-
tively within the Russian political and economic
system. The Baltic States of Lithuania, Estonia
and Latvia, which have disappeared into the
maw, are now accounted Red “republics.
Outer Mongolia is described as an “autono-
mous people’s republic.” Korea supposedly is
shared with the Lnited States in a five-year con-
dominium. Territorial spoils acknowledgedly
taken by Russia consist ot East Prussia, eastern
Poland, eastern Finland, North Bukovina and
Bessarabia in Rumania, the Kuriles, and Kara-
fut'o, the former Japanese half of Sakhalin
Island. All of the other areas in which she
has installed her troops or her puppet Govern-
ments are equally components of the new Red
empire, while Soviet pressure is constantly being
exerted in every direction beyond the present
frontiers.— Chicago “Tribune.”

Denouncing U.N.R.R.A. as the “biggest
racket in Europe,” Cyril Osborne, Conservative
British M.P., of Louth, declared that the sooner
it Was closed down the better it would be for
the people of Britain . . . More than two billion
dollars contributed by the U.S. through
U.N.R.R.A. had been used “to finance Gov-
ernments and not to feed the hungry,” said
Senator Butler, one of a party of five mem-
bers of Congress returned from a visit to
33 countries. “Little or none of the material
which we thought was for the hungry and
the needy actually went to such persons, it
was used and is being used to raise money
for Governments. When thousands of motor
vehicles were sent to China the Government
promptly slapped an embargo on imports of
trucks and cars until it could sell what it got
from U.N.R.R.A. The money thus raised
didn’t go to the needy. It was the same in
other countries benefiting from the American
taxpayer’s money.” —Chicago “Tribune” report.

The Austrian is a confused and sorry figure.
In Vienna the food is worse than in Berlin and
there is less of it. Even the blackmarket fails
to yield decent meals. In the Kleine Brettl
Cabaret sad comedians make sadder jokes about
life, love and the occupation. Jokes about the
Russians are singularly scarce. I, asked a
Viennese why. “About the Russians we are
too bitter,” he said melodramatically; “we
cannot laugh.” Edward P. Morgan in

Great Britain is moving to protect her heavy
financial inteiests in Argentina. Estimated at
fi to 2\ billion dollars, her investments far ex-
ceed those of the U.S., second-largest foreign
investor in Argentina. Railroads represent the
largest part. Other investments the British
want to safeguard cover a wide range of busi-
nesses. Meat-packing plants, port facilities and
various kinds of public utilities in which British
investments total at least 127 million dollars
are under threat of nationalisation. Land re-
distribution, pledged by Peron during his presi-
dential campaign, would jeopardise nearly 30
million dollars’ worth of British agricultural
investments. In trade, the United Kingdom is
still Argentina’s No. 1 customer, but, because
of the war, she has lost her place as Argen-
tina’s No. I supplier. During the war and since,
the U.S. and Brazil have alternated in the
position of biggest seller to Argentina. Now
the United Kingdom is seeking her old place,
in which she furnished nearly one-fourth of
Argentina’s total imports. Temporarily, Argen-
tina has a strong bargaining position. The
world is begging for her food. Attempts will
be made to play off the U.S., Russia and other
industrial nations against the British. But
Argentine demands are unlikely to be pro-
hibitive, for Argentina knows that the day ot
world food surpluses eventually will return.
When it does return, Argentina must have
Britain as a food customer. She will not
jeopardise that future market by driving too
hard a bargain now. —“ World Reports

CANADA RUBS IT IN.
In early election advertisements the Prime
Minister pooh-poohed the idea of tax-
reduction. One, prepared for Anzac Day
reading and embellished with the already
familiar photograph of the Chifley coun-
tenance, complete with pipe—the pipe
which has now disappeared till after Sep-
tember 28 —declared that “neither I nor
my Government will attempt to sway the
verdict of the people with extravagant
promises.”
We will not bid against the Liberal
party’s reckless pledges... .unf affiliable
promises of sweeping tax-reductions.
Last week, speaking in the Melbourne
Town Hall, the leader of the “Govern-
ment” which had “no need to resort to
vote-catching promises” was constrained
to promise that “ ‘Labor’ will from time
to time examine the whole field of taxa-
tion” and, “when possible, it will reduce
both direct and indirect taxation.” Previ-
ously his Minister of Labor and National
Service, who is member for Melbourne
Ports, had offered to bet “a packet of
cigarettes” that “taxes” would be “cut
by more than 40 per cent, in three years,”
and Mr. Ward was going round the coun-
try promising “sweeping” reductions of
indirect taxes. In short, the “Govern-
ment” was on the run.
As with the “substantial (?) cuts” which
were forced on him by Caucus fears and
Opposition protests, Mr. Chifley made the
new promise reluctantly and churlishly.
Referring to the tax-cuts to which the
Liberal and C.P. leaders have com-
mitted themselves, he accused them of
trying to “politically bribe you before
they attempt to politically rob you.” This
is not the language of any Prime Minister
this country knew before Mr. Chifley
came along. It is more like the squawk
of a vulture about to be dragged from
its prey.
Exactly a fortnight before Mr. Chifley
informed Parliament and the nation that
“the Government does not intend to
bring down a Budget”—in other words,
having to go to the country, it refused
to let the electors know how it had spent
last year and proposed to spend this year
the immense sums extracted from
them in taxes —Mr. J. L. Isley, the
Canadian Minister of Finance, com-
mended to the House of Commons at
Ottawa “the Budget which I now have
the honor and duty to place before the
House.” What Mr. Chifley called his
“financial statement” occupies about 8i
pages of Hansard. Mr. Isley’s Budget
runs to just on 27 pages of the corre-
sponding Canadian publication, which is
about the same size, and there were in
addition 57 pages of Budget papers, com-
prising a review of Government accounts
and tables on economic conditions.
The Isley Budget must have strongly
influenced Mr. Nash, the N.Z. Labor
Minister of Finance, when that gentleman
was drawing up his Budget and working
out his proposals for tax-reductions which
have made Mr. Chifley’s look so cheap
and mean.
In N.Z. and Canada alike the financial
year ends on March 31, and Mr. Isley
recalled that he had announced a “flat
16 p.c. reduction in income tax in last
year’s Budget” together with a reduction
in excess-profits tax, which, with the other
taxes on company profits, Mr. Chifley
proposes to maintain at the full war-time
figure.
The Canadian Minister said he had
hoped to remove the excess-profits tax
“as from January 1, 1947,” since such an
impost “has distinct weaknesses and is
not to be accepted as a permanent part of
our tax structure.” Because “we are
still living in highly abnormal times, with
the shadow of the war still upon us,” he
had decided that “the Act should stay
on the Statute Book for another year
unless provision is made in the next
session for earlier repeal,” but the rate
of tax would be reduced from 20 p.c, to
15 p.c. and would “apply solely to cor-
porations,” all partnerships and sole pro-
prietors being exempted. And corpora-
tions, previously taxed 18 p.c. on income
and 22 p.c, on excess profits, would in
future pay a flat rate of 30 p.c. to cover
both taxes, the relief granted under these
heads being reckoned at $135,000,000 for
the full 1947 year. As for personal in-
comes “we are proposing a substantial
reduction in rates, effective from Jan. 1,
and a thorough reorganisation of this
tax”; —
The exemption-limits under the present
tax are $660 for single persons and $l2OO
for married persons without dependants.
As a major part of the present revision
we are proposing exemptions of $750 and
$l5OO. The exemption of $750 compares
with $7OO in Australia and New Zealand;
the exemption of $l5OO compares with
$1077 in New Zealand and $931 in Aus-
tralia. In addition, Australia and New Zea-
land have substantial social-security taxes
which apply at much lower levels than the
exemptions I have given. And it is pro-
posed to allow a single simple reduction
from income of $lOO for each child eligible
to receive family allowances and to regard
all taxpayers having such children as re-
ceiving the family allowances for their
children. For other dependants not eligible
for family allowances there will be allowed
a straight reduction from income of $3OO.
These measures will remove entirely from
the income-tax roll between 550,000 and
600,000 taxpayers, or about one-quarter
of the present number.
The overall effect will be to reduce income-
tax revenue in a full year, assuming the
present level of incomes, by approximately
$143,000,000, or about 23 per cent., and
will involve the payment of additional
family allowances in the amount of
$12,000,000 per year, making a total cost
of $155,000,000, about one-quarter of our
expected revenue from this tax before the
proposed reduction. The reductions we
are now making are to be added to the
flat 16 per cent, reduction in income tax
announced in last year’s Budget.
With cuts in succession duties and ex-
cise, the sacrifice of revenue for the first
full year is reckoned by Mr. Isley at
$266,000,000. Mr. Chifley has sacrificed
no revenue. On the contrary the amount
he dragged from the taxpayers in 1945-46,
£390,779,300 (to which £92,000,000 of un-
collected and unassessed income tax must
be added), exceeded his estimate by just
on £17,000,000.
Like Mr. Nash, Mr. Isley has no craven
fear that tax-reduction will mean infla-
tion. He admits the existence of “infla-
tionary pressures,” but says that “the
real answer, the constructive answer, is to
work and produce the goods that are
wanted in greater volume.”
The action we take now in regard to
taxes should provide whatever stimulus is
required to increase production. If we
can encourage hard work and increase
production we shall be assisting greatly
the effectiveness of our other actions to
overcome the inflationary influences left
behind by the war and... .should be mov-
ing towards our normal post-war tax
policy. Once the hpge temporary post-
war demands have been satisfied, we must
depend on steady, large-scale capital ex-
penditures by private business and on our
ability to sell our products abroad (and
at home, too) in competition with other
countries if we are to succeed in maintain-
ing a high level of employment and a high
standard of living. To secure these con-
ditions of stable prosperity we must revise
our war-time tax system in such a way to
preserve essential fairness in the distribution
of the total burden and avoid any serious
deterrent to hard work and efficiency.
Production should be our primary objec-
tive, both for its own sake in a world that
needs goods so badly, and as a safeguard
against inflation. No longer must civilian
production be restricted in order to con-
serve resources for war. It can now re-
ceive first priority.
Taken by and large, this Canadian
Budget makes “Labor’s” selfish material-
ism look like the desert from Dan to
Beersheba. While “Labor,” pigeon-
livered in its attitude to the Communist
conspiracy, allowed a parcel of water-
front hoodlums to wreck Australia’s ex-
port trade with the Netherlands East
Indies, a trade with infinite possibilities,
in the process stooping to the inhuman
ruffianism of refusing passage to mercy
ships laden with Australian goods and
repairs to a wounded warship (this when
the Canadian Government was smashing
a vast Soviet spy plot and getting a
Communist M.P. imprisoned for six
years), Canadian Liberalism was con-
cerned with the revival of its Dominion’s
export trade with customers who have to
be helped on their feet again. So we find
Mr. Isley saying that “while the need of
overseas countries for aur exports is
enormous and urgent, most of them can
only buy from us on credit,” and going
on to announce that “therefore the Gov-
ernment has undertaken a large pro-
gramme of export credits.”
This is a sequel to the generous Can-
adian policy of Mutual Aid —modestly
so called, for Canada got little or nothing
in return from most of the beneficiaries.
Australia was, and is, among them. To
March 31, 1946, this country had re-
ceived gifts of war materials, timber,
machine tools and foodstuffs from Canada
to the value of $15,651,000; and there
has been no expression of gratitude at
Canberra that anyone can remember. In
addition, Australia benefited from
Canada’s bearing most of the financial
burden of the British Commonwealth
Empire Air Training Plan which contri-
buted so powerfully to the defeat of the
Axis Powers, Germany in particular.
Six months ago Canada’s outlay in all
forms of assistance to its war partners
had reached the colossal sum of
$7,617,237,331:
Mutual Aid $2,575,104,000
Export credits 502,500,000
Export credits (tentative) .. 142,000,000
Wheat credit to Russia .. 10,000,000

$7,617,237,331
Magnificent, and not only an expression
of internationalism in the noblest sense
of the word but, very obviously, an effect
of great financial measures and careful
control of home expenditure no
squandering of the public funds on
hordes of Government employees or on
overseas jaunts for a host of minor poli-
ticians and trade-union bosses, Red or
Pink. By sharing with its partners arid
accepting a great financial sacrifice,
Canada has added cubits to its stature
among the nations. Its generosity will be
remembered with gratitude when Dr.
Evatt’s incessant attempts to hit the
headlines are forgotten. Except for a
Scully promise of half-price wheat to
New Zealand at the cost, not of the
nation but of the men who grow the
wheat, “Labor’s” history of assistance to
war associates is a blank. “Labor”
sullenly refused to make a gift of
food to the British people, and
even tried to scotch the Food for
Britain appeals. When “Labor” entered
office by the door thrown open by Mr.
Wilson and Mr.'Coles —both now in very
comfortable positions —kindness flew out
of the window.
No, No, NO.
By now every elector should have had the
opportunity to read the official referen-
dum pamphlet. Some have no doubt
dodged it out of laziness or cussedness.
Others will have done so because, having
been so ordered about and pushed around
and misdirected by one Governmental and
departmental regulation after another
through the war years, they now shudder
at the sight of anything bearing the. stamp
of coming from such quarters. Others
again will almost certainly have refrained
because they are well aware of the history
of these proposals, and have already
made up their minds to vote No to the
lot of them on that very ground alone.
The soundness of that ground rests
on the knowledge that the Constitution
was the product of the protracted
deliberations of a representative conven-
ing of the best men available, and on the
conviction that it should be radically
altered only after the same procedure has
been followed. The alterations now pro-
posed are the hatchings of one sectional
political party; really of one man —Dr.
Evatt.
There is the knowledge, too, that this
is not the first attempt of the party or
Dr. Evatt to get through such piecemeal
alterations of the Constitution, and that
the earlier attempt, in 1944, was spurned
by majorities so crushing that the making
of this similar attempt so soon is an im-
pertinence. It is indeed an insult to the
intelligence of those who, only a couple
of years ago, said with their votes that
they would rather put up with the Consti-
tution as it is than permit it to be altered
by any party- or Evatt-hatched amend-
ment. Can any of them now doubt that
they were right? .
Other general aspects must enter into
deciding the No of many voters. The
referendum proposals are put forward for
decision in the confusion of a general
election. They are deliberately brought
down from the national to the party level.
The hope of the sponsors is that, if re-
turned on party grounds, they will be able
to drag the electiomapproved proposals
with them, as a mandate to legislate under
the three new clauses to any socialistic
limits they may have in mind or to which
they may be forced to go by their masters
outside Parliament.
It must further decide the No of many
voters that Yes has unanimous Com-
munist support. That support is as signi-
ficant as its service to the sponsors of the
referendum proposals is dubious. With
the ugly experience of the Communist per-
formance during the war and since; the
knowledge that Communism is not a
political party in any accepted sense but
a world-wide conspiracy owing first allegi-
ance to a foreign country; the fact that
Communists eagerly approve of the Com-
monwealth Constitution being altered as
proposed by Dr. Evatt, who removed the
Menzies ban on their party, cannot help
but make voters look suspiciously into
the proposals.
They will not have to look far. The
third question aims at adding to the Con-
stitution a clause (XXXI Va) giving
power to legislate on “Terms and condi-
tions of employment in industry, but not
so as to authorise any form of industrial
conscription.” The possible limits to
which a Socialist or a Communist-con-
trolled Government could go under this
proposal have, of course, not been fixed,
nor have they been so much as discussed
by any competent representative assembly.
The clause, in common with the other
two proposals, is in that respect a blank
cheque which voters are asked to sign
and hand over.
It is quite clear, and admitted by the
proposals’ sponsors (Mr. Calwell, in par-
ticular, let the cat out of the bag in
Perth), that this particular clause would
give the Government power to fix the
basic wage and other wages, hours of
work and working conditions. That is,
it would usurp the functions of all the
Arbitration Courts or so override their
decisions as to make them futile. To
destroy the arbitration system has been
all along the open objective of Com-
munists ; and where and when have the
proposers of this “improvement” on the
Constitution shown themselves capable of
anything but fawning surrender under
Communist pressure or the pressure of
alleged “moderates” bidding against Com-
munists for union control?
Another of these proposed insertions
into the Constitution reads:
(XXIIIa) The provision of maternity
allowances, widows’ pensions, child endow-
ment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sick-
ness and hospital benefits, medical and
dental services (but not so as to authorise
any form of civil conscription), benefits
to students and family allowances.
This is the very essence of dishonest
pretence. Voters are asked to believe
that unless the clause is written into the
Constitution the validity of baby bonus,
widows’ pensions and child-endowment
payments may be challenged in the High
Court and the challenge upheld. As those
who read the Yes case in the referendum
pamphlet must know, this pretence is in
line with the whole theme of that “case,'
which is to scare the voters stiff. It is as
hollow as it is shabby. Every voter in the
.country could write No to it without
jeopardising a solitary payment.
Maternity allowances have been
paid since 1912 without the hint of chal-
lenge or question from any quarter.
From what possible source could question
arise in the future apropos of any of the
Commonwealth social-service payments?
Litigation would be necessary. Only a
mad millionaire, bowelless and imper-
vious to hate, could launch it, and in the
almost inconceivable event of his suc-
ceeding in the High Court or the Privy
Council, he could be euchred by an ex-
tension of grants-in-aid to the States,
authorised by section 96 (“The Parlia-
ment may grant financial assistance to
any State on such terms and conditions as
the Parliament thinks fit”), to cover the
social-security payments affected. The
claim that this Evatt “amendment” is re-
quired is utter bunkum.
The other proposed addition to the
Constitution (la), giving power to legis-
late for “Organised marketing of primary
products,” is at once the most sectional
of the three and the most laughable as
upheld in the For-and-Against referen-
dum pamphlet. The one it hits, and the
one the general voter will consider in
turning it down, is the land man. What
it aims at securing for its socialistic
sponsors is authority in time of peace
“to make effective laws for the organised
marketing of primary products similar in
effect to the power exercised during the
war” (referendum pamphlet Yes case,
except for the italics). If wheatgrowers,
sheepmen and dairymen still have a laugh
left in them after the “ ‘Labor’ Govern-
ment's” mishandling of their affairs under
war-time enforced controls, that “similar
in effect” must strike them as the joke
of the year. It is capped by another:
“The great benefits which primary pro-
ducers have received during the war is
one of the main reasons why they do not
want the Commonwealth to lose its mar-
keting powers in the post-war period.
The leader of the Country party had a
good deal to say on that in his policy
speech. So far from having any thanks
or praise to offer the “Government on
behalf of land men, Mr. Fadden pre-
sented detailed charges against the “Gov-
ernment” of having, as a deliberate act
of policy, deprived wheatgrowers and
the wool and dairy industries of huge
Sums of money due to them —on the
score of wheat, £6,000,000 ; wool, near!}
£8,000,000; dairying, £3,500,000. The
loss to the wheatgrowers, Mr. Fadden
said, resulted from selling by the Gov-
ernment” on a discretionary basis; an
abandonment, for the first time in the
history of wheat selling, of the sound
tradition that all sales, other than those
for local consumption,- should be mace
at the prevailing export parity,” Ihe
other occurred through bungling °
arbitrary “Government” acts, in the
sweet name of “organised marketing _
Not surprising if, having felt the ‘ effect
of limitless power over his affairs as ex-
ercised by Canberra, the land man
along with many another f° r
reasons —is waiting with a treble NG.

struck by one thing in particular—a re-
markable change of feeling in favor of
Mr. Menzies.
It has been noticed wherever the Oppo-
sition-leader has appeared. Largely it
means that many who were misled by the
vicious Communist slanders at the time
when the name of Soviet Russia was
built up as sacred by war-time propa-
gandists, politicians, duped sentimentalists
and, of course, Corns have been brought
up sharply by the actions of both Com-
munists and the country they serve. But
a good deal of it, too, results from the
general Australian admiration for any-
one who has clear principles and shows
that he has guts in sticking to them.
Throughout the sloppy period of
Soviet adulation Mr. Menzies stood up to
the Communist campaign of personal
attack on him —one of Communism’s
welcome and well-rewarded services
to “Labor.” If there is anyone in the
“Government” who could have shown
the same grit—let alone gone on effec-
tively hitting back—there is a singular
lack of evidence of it.
Mr. Menzies has taken a more tolerant
attitude towards Communists than their
record here and in other parts of the
Empire warrants; but he banned them
when —Soviet Russia not then having
been driven by invasion into the war
against its Fascist partner in pact of non-
aggression and friendship and war-
materials supplies—they were sabotaging
Australia’s war effort. It was left to
“Labor,” through the instrumentality of
Dr. Evatt, to lift the ban. Till the name
of Soviet Russia lost its false sentimental
aura, and Communists were exposed in
Canada and elsewhere as traitorous fifth-
columnist spies, “Labor” and Communism
ran openly in double-harness.
In that teamwork nothing was more
valued by “Labor” than the unceasing
Communist attack on Mr. Menzies.
Under “Labor” Communism was granted
immunity to work to the detriment of
Australia—bringing chaos to industry,
transport 'arid the general wellbeing and
recovery of the nation. “Labor’s” re-
wards for services rendered are not ended
yet. In electorates where it knows first-
preferences will have no value to its
candidates it makes the gesture of being
opposed tooth and nail to Communism
and orders allocation of preferences
accordingly. In Kooyong “Labor’s” in-
struction is that preferences are to go to
the Communist candidate. Actually a
high compliment to the man the “Gov-
ernment” most fears.
That direction of preferences in
Kooyong is, of course, no more than
characteristic of the whole “Labor” anti-
Communist pretence, the worth of which
anyone can see instantly by comparing
Dr. Evatt’s table-thumping abroad and
his complete silence on the Soviet sabot-
aging of the peace since his return. The
great table-thumper has said not one
word on the subject of his recent his-
trionics. Instead, he has publicly kow-
towed to the Corns.
The record of the Opposition-leader
will certainly show nothing like that. It
will be found to have the consistency
that stands on principles and never exists
without, them. Australians, who admire
nothing more than grit and strength of
puipose, are remembering that record.
The typical Communist abusive epithets
—“Fascist,” “Pig-iron Bob”—are now
jokes. The man they sought to damage
can join in the laugh.
Calamity's Child.
It was a luckless hour for Australia
when Mr. Scully gave up being a dog-
racing judge and threw himself into
“Labor” politics as M.H.R. for Gwydir
(N.S.W.), to become a “Labor” Minister.
Had he been Scullius, of ancient Rome
or Greece, he would long ago have been
violently divested of his garments and
offered up as a sacrifice to appease the
vengeance of Ceres and Pan, with all the
other gods and goddesses nodding ap-
proval.
From the time Scullius began paying
Westralian wheatgrowers vast sums for
not growing wheat he has been a
child of calamity. His trail is littered
with costly wheat distilleries, dehydra-
tion plants and wool-appraisement floors,
unused or disused. Now he is desperately
pleading for support in an electorate
deep in the grip of drought.
Ordinarily a big wheat-yielder, Gwydir
won’t have any wheat this year. The
growers are grimly pondering on the
Scully stabilisation” scheme, which de-
prives them of their equity in about half
the proceeds of their good 1945-46 crop—
money which would have tided them
over the present bad time. Similarly,
Gwydir sheepmen are musing bitterly on
the Scully measure which assigns to his
“Government” profits of £7,000,000 to
£10,000,000 on dealings in compulsorily
delivered wool.
Another blow fell last week when wool-
buyers refused to attend sales at the
Scully floor at Moree—estimated cost
£50,000 —because the advertised Moree
sale clashed with Brisbane sales and they
couldn’t be in two places at once. Few
of them would have gone to Moree, any-
way. Neither buyers nor growers wanted
the Moree floor, but it was thought it
might catch a few votes. So there it is—
as idle as Mr. Scully’s wheat distilleries
and vegetable drying plants, as bankrupt
as his political reputation.
These Taxes.
Canada, like New Zealand, pafjs endow-
ment on the first child, and its generous
plan of family allowances has no income
limit. Where there are four in a family
(three in the case of a widower or a
widow) the allowance, $144, is the same
whether the income is $l3OO or $13,000
or even $200,000. These Canadian and
N.Z. payments on the first child make
nonsense of the “Labor” contention that
the finances would be wrecked if Aus-
tralia followed suit—there are other ex-
cuses equally preposterous.
A comparison of Canadian and Aus-
tralian income-tax rates and payments is
“PIPER, PIPE THAT DREAM AGAIN!”

It looks as though Mr. Fadden, if sent
back to the Treasury, would dispense
with most of the huge (though con-
cealed) expenditures on External Affairs,
the Attorney-General’s and Information
Departments cut down overseas jaunts to
a minimum and send most of the planners

Defaming the Dead.
In Melbourne the P.M. attacked “seven
big businessmen on the Commonwealth
Bank Board,” alleging that during the de-
pression “300,000 breadwinners were out
of work and their wives and children on
the verge of starvation,” and that “the
Bank Board was prepared to see all that
happen.” Another remark attributed to
and uncontradicted by him was that the
seven big businessmen “drove thousands
of Australians into poverty and degra-
dation.”
As the “‘Argus” pointed out, with just
indignation, one of these “seven big
businessmen” was Ernest Riddle, gover-
nor of the Commonwealth Bank from
1915. Another was I. T. Heathershaw,
the veteran secretary of the Treasury.
Others were trained bankers, Mackenzie
Lees and Claude Reading, who was to
succeed Robert Gibson as chairman;
Gibson was a manufacturer and had been
an honorary Repatriation Commissioner
and member of Victoria’s State Electricity
Commission. For coadjutors there were
R. S. Drummond, a pastoralist, and R.
B. W. McComas, merchant and member
of the Commonwealth Central Wool
Committee,
These men could have held up their
heads in any company. Assuredly none
of them would have sought the company,
much less imitated the ways, of the dog-
punter whom Federal “Labor” sent to
New Zealand as High Commissioner,
and who, according to his own account,
paid a debt in £5 and £lO notes from a
dog-punting “bank” kept in his Minis-
terial office. Nearly all of them are
dead, and their memory should be
•honored, not defamed. They set their
faces like flint against the ruinous interest-
default “policy” with which Mr. Ward
and Mr.- Lazzarini identified themselves,
and largely because of the measures they
and like-minded men like Professor Cop-
land recommended to the feeble Scullin
Administration—they found a firm sup-
porter in Mr, Hogan, of Victoria, who
sacrificed his Premiership to his con-
victions —Australia was actually the first
country to emerge from the depression.
And so far from there having been a
multitude of deaths from starvation and
malnutrition-caused diseases, the number
of deaths per 1000 of mean annual popu-
lation was lower in the depression years
than in previous and subsequent years.

Maltese and European Jews.
The seventeenth Commonwealth Parlia-
ment having followed its predecessors
into history, it is not possible for any
member to question Mr, Calwell in the
House for further details of his pro-
gramme of Jewish immigration. To a
question asked on March 20 by Comrade
Watkins (Newcastle), who seemed rather
aggrieved, Mr. Calwell replied that he
had issued “2000 landing permits” to Jews
who had been in “Belsen or Buchenwald
in slave-labor gangs or were otherwise
homeless or destitute in Europe.”
He protested that the permits carried
no priority; but since then more than
one vessel from which high-priority Aus-
tralians or British have been debarred
has included “displaced persons” on
its passenger list, and there has been a
flow of Jewish refugees via Shanghai.
Last week a vessel from Hongkong
brought 50 persons described—falsely—
as “the first group of about 300 refugees
coming to Australia from the East,” and
otherwise described as German Jews.
Questions Mr. Calwell could be asked
if the House were sitting are;
(1) Are these people genuine Far Eastern
refugees or have they made their way there
from Europe in recent months? (2) If the
latter, have they displaced anf Australian
or British subjects who could have come
to Australia by the same route? (3) Has
any guarantee been required of them that
they will not “declare war on the British
• Empire,” as terrorists have done in
Palestine.
It’s a long cry from the arrival of these
refugee migrants to the “Maltese immi-
grants” controversy of 1916.
Overcrowded Malta was looking to
Australia as a possible field for migra-
tion long before the outbreak of the
First World War. In 1912 466 Maltese
arrived in this country; in 1913, 304;
in 1914, 346 ; in 1915, 159. Their ad-
vent caused no particular disturbance,
and there was no organised protest. But
when in September, 1916, the steamer
Arabia brought a batch of 98 Maltese
to these shores there was an immediate
reaction. The first conscription referen-
dum campaign was in full swing, and
trade-union circles professed to see a
dark plot to replace future conscripts
with cheap Maltese labor. Some even
went as far as to suggest that that was
the real purpose behind conscription.
News then arrived that a further 200
had already left Malta in the French
steamer Gange. Wrote Ernest Scott in
the A ustralian Official War History :
Efforts little short of desperate were
made by the Government to stop the ship,
or to have her diverted to Darwin, Fiji or
Samoa, or at least prevent the Maltese
from reaching Australia till after the poll.
f... Her captain was made to carry them
on to New Caledonia, whence, after being
retained for a few weeks at the expense of
the Commonwealth Government, they were
returned via Sydney to their own country.
These British subjects were unfortunate
victims of the anti-conscriptionists, in
whose ranks were included most of the
members of the present Federal Cabinet.
By word and deed since, Mr. Calwell has
made it quite clear that he heartily en-
dorsed “Labor’s” anti-conscription policy,
and there is little room for doubt where
he stood on the Maltese question.
On the subject of non-British immi-
grants there is no doubt. According to
the “New Citizen,” a Sydney Jewish
paper, 150 refugees left Marseilles for
Sydney on September 15 and 250 will
leave on September 27. The paper de-
scribes them as “relatives of new citizens
who have obtained their landing permits
under the Calwell scheme.”
Jessie Has Another Dream.
Though Soviet imperialism and the
Canadian spy trials and Communist sabo-
tage in Australia are forbidden subjects
on “Labor” election platforms, Moscow
continues to growl about the refusal of
“facilities” to the half-dozen Soviet ladies
who were to have come to Australia but
missed the ’bus or something and re-
turned to the Workers’ Fatherland full of
pique.
The person responsible for the
whole thing is “Labor’s” candidate against
Harrison in Wentworth, Mrs. Jessie
Street.
This lady’s association with Com-
munists and near-Communists was over-
looked by the. Sydney A.L.P. executive
when it went through the motions of
putting a ban on Communist organisa-
tions and subsidiaries and it hastily ex-
empted her “Russophile” show. Last
week bands of athletic young Corns
flitted through the electorate by night
slapping Jessie Street posters on Govern-
ment, municipal and private property, an
activity which mightily offended the civic
pride of the residents.
“Labor” must be wishing it had never
heard of the lady, especially as she hasn’t
a Chinaman’s chance of beating Harrison.

CARRERAS LIMITED - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
Menzies, aroused at Murrumbeena
(Vic.) by an interjection in the “Labor”-
Saved-the-Country vein:
If I were to waste time talking about
the past I could tell you a story about what
was done in the first two years of war by
those miserable and boastful creatures who
live on the work that was done then and
seek to make themselves out as the de-
liverers of this country. But I will not
waste your time, because most people want
to know what is going to happen in the
next three years.
Had “Labor” had its way there would
have been no A.I.F. in 1941. In other
words, “Labor” wouldn’t have been able
to recall the Sixth, Seventh and Ninth
Divisions from the scene of their glory and
over-use them in the tropical islands, or to
promise the Eighth, through the mouth
of Forde, “an overwhelming torrent” of
reinforcements and equipment that never
came and never could have come. No
doubt the campaigns in Ambon, Timor
and Java would have gone as they did,
according to “Labor’s” plans (and what
plans!), but the wasted troops wouldn’t
have been A.I.F. Certainly there would
have been no useless sacrifice of Brigadier
Blackburn’s force of Seventh Division
veterans to the “Fight for Australia in
Java” howl.
It is an old' custom in’ the N.S.W. Leg.
Council for “Labor” members to absent
themselves from important divisions, and
two. Graves and Tannock, were missing
when the Chifley-McKell Coal Industry
B|ll came on. Graves was a Lang man ;
Tannock is (or was) a member of Thorn-
ton’s Red Racket and secretary of the
N.S.W. Aid Russia Committee. In Their
absence the measure was radically
amended. It was sent back to “another
place” in its original form, with the in-
timation that boiling oil would be noth-
ing to what would happen to Tannock
and Graves if they were not in their
places with their votes.
Exploiting the misery of houseless
people and their resentment at the unful-
filled promises of “Labor” Ministers
(Aneurin Bevan in Britain and Lazzarini
in Australia), Communists are stage-
managing a wholesale seizure of houses
and huts. A lot of the London
“squatters” seem to be Jews from
Stepney, whose M.P. is a Communist
Jew appropriately named Piratin. Othfers,
who took possession of Fountain Court,
Westminster, sent a pathetic appeal for
“help in our distress” to the King. After
waiting for public opinion tp set hard
against the Piratins and their proteges,
the Government had six Communists
arrested on a conspiracy charge. Forde’s
method of dealing with “squatters” who
took possession of part of the Holland
Park Military Hospital, Brisbane, was
to order that they should be supplied
with free gas and electricity after the
Army had cut off supplies. Hpw Corns
must hope and pray to the gods of their
idolatry that Forde’s mob will be in
office when they start their revolution!
Lang, though leader of a definite Labor
group, and very likely to become M.H.R.
for Reid, was refused a nation-wide net-
work for his statement of policy. A.B.C.
gave preference to an insolent and ill-
pronounced “policy speech” by the Com-
munist yob Sharkey. Another of A.B.C.’s
proteges, a Sydney University lecturer
named Makinson, has admitted that he is
a Communist —this at another meeting of
the “Australian Association of Scientific
Workers,” which repeatedly “demands”
the release of the ten-years-sentenced
Nunn May. There are poor fish among
“scientists” and “scientific workers,” and
there is no more contemptible creature
in the Empire than the same Nunn May.
Arising out of the Kirby report on
Tasmanian forestry matters, Frank
Fenton and Donald Wallace Chisholm
were charged with corruption in Hobart
and found not guilty. Nolle prosequis
were entered by the Crown in the cases
of Leslie Rowland Hill and Melville
Roy Garrett, and in another charge
against Chisholm. In the affair of ex-
Minister D’Alton, Alstergren and Nos-
worthy, against whom an indictment was
filed by the Crown, D’Alton appeared
again before the Chief Justice, who
ordered a remand on bail already fixed
in the Police Court. A censure notion in
the Assembly, concerning in particular the
sale of Lake Leake land to A. G. New-
man, was defeated, and West, M.H.A.,
gave notice of intention to ask that costs
and compensation be granted to Garrett
and Chisholm.
The N.T.’s p.-0.-w. member:
Before the 1943 election Curtin said it was
incredible that any decent man would stand
against the prisoner-of-war A. M. Blain, mem-
ber for the N.T. Blain was then in Kuching
under torture, wondering whether or not he
would be sentenced to death for a gallant
attempt to escape from Sandakan camp. An
“unofficial” “Labor” candidate, one Murray,
entered the lists, along with five other
incredibles, and was defeated in the sixth
ballot. This champion has been officially
endorsed by the A.L.P. for another contest. His
election pamphlet expresses the hope that Blain
will not this lime receive the “sympathy” vote
which elected him last time. There are two
others in the field a “Northern Territory
Labor” man, a young doctor, and an A.W.C.
official. But, judging by the receptions which
Blain has been getting at his meetings, the
issue is little in doubt. At Alice Springs,
where his policy speech was delivered in a
packed hall, there was only one consistent
interrupter —an individual whom nature seemed
to have endowed with a loudspeaker instead
of a head, who sat among a guard of Commos
and displayed in his continuous bellowing all
the qualities of the “Yabba” of Sydney Cricket
Ground Hill, except humor and intelligence.
On the hottest day since the summer
the N.S.W. “Labor” ban on radiators,
electric signs and the like was removed —
a characteristic sequel to the running*of
Saturday .race trams and trains and the
banning of Sunday trams plying to hos-
pitals, cemeteries and watering places.
The dog-racing element improved the
shining hour by announcing that tfre
nocturnal pursuit of tin hares would be
resumed immediately on crowds of
courses. Meanwhile the shortage of coal
for N.S.W. trains carrying starving stock
and for lighting and industrial uses in
Victoria and N. S. Wales remains. The
McKelly gang is nothing if not stony-
hearted and unneighborly.
* American affairs at the moment are in
a dreadful mess. The Wagner Act, a
New Deal measure, gave union bosses
like Green of the A.F.L., Curran of the
C. 1.0. and Lewis of the Coalminers
power without responsibility, and it has
gone to all their heads. The C. 1.0. group
of maritime unions had a strike from
which the A.F.L. group of maritime unions
held aloof. The strike having been settled
on the usual terms —a massive increase of
pay, with prices catching up immediately
—the A.F.L. group of maritime unions
came out. Their strike having been
“settled,” the C. 1.0; group held up ship-
ping again on the ground that the first
“settlement” gave the A.F.L. more than the
C. 1.0. got. Meanwhile Henry Wallace, who
was Roosevelt’s Vice-President, delivered
a muzzy attack on his Government’s be-
lated policy of standing up to the Soviet,
alleging that if the Government didn’t
dump Britain and crawl to Russia it
would land the country in another war.
Wallace originated the crazy policy of
paying farmers to plough up their crops,
imitated in the “Labor” fashion by
Calamity Scully.
Having a shot at quietening the wide-
spread objections to Corns being admitted
to R.S.L. membership—the Victorian
branch had banned them outright—the
Federal executive has put forward what
could be a solution ; at least unless there’s
serious trouble with Soviet Russia. Corns
may now be asked to affirm and subscribe
to R.S.L. objects and policy, “in parti-
cular affirm loyalty to Australia and the
King and Empire,” and be prepared to
take the oath of allegiance. Signing that
would be no trouble to Corns. Another
Federal executive decision could help:
If any individual is disloyal or advocates
any course of conduct, political or other-
wise, contrary to the policy of the R.S.L.
or its constitution, such person could be
dealt with by the State branch or sub-
branch.
Many Diggers will go on questioning
the eligibility of any professed and prac-
tising Communist for membership of a
league which has been “Imperial” from
the beginning.
Speaking at a place called Wowan,
Forde was bothered by a constituent who
had a string of questions stored up for
him. One was whether it was in order
for the Diggers’ Pride when visiting his
electorate “to interest himself in securing
extra tobacco for a storekeeper, more
beer for a certain hotel and tyres and
tubes for a certain man.” The reply, as
per report, was that “as the
representative of the electors,” the
Diggers’ Pride was “approachable by any-
one, from the humblest to the richest, for
any assistance that could be afforded
through his aid.” No pun intended. And
nobody can deny that the reply was
worthy of. the Diggers’ Pride.
U.N.R.R.A. is dying, though not before
its time, and the palpable fact that it has
been made an instrument of Communist
racketeering, and of the prolonging of
the agony of huge Russian occupation
forces in stricken countries longing to see
the last of them, will prevent any resur-
rection. La Guardia, who “removed”
the forthright General Morgan for being
too forthright, looks like transferring his
admitted energy to the International Food
and Agricultural Organisation, Address-
ing delegates at Copenhagen, he made
them laugh by describing a morning in
the life of a grain broker:
He goes to his office and reads “The
Queen of Rumania has powdered her
nose”; then he shouts over his shoulder
“Sell a hundred thousand bushels.” He
goes on to read “Dr. Evatt of Australia
has made another speech,” and shouts
“Buy a hundred thousand bushels.”
That certainly would make a cat laugh.
In another U.N.R.R.A. report on White
Russia —“Byelorussia” the Corns call it—
the head of a mission to that Soviet “re-
public” describes it as “the most devas-
tated country in the world.” It has had
two full years for “rehabilitation” and
will need another two years at least, its
Communist masters being what they are.
The people, although deeply appreciative
of what U.N.R.R.A. has done for them,
fiijd it hard to believe that other countries
do not realise their plight.
Well, the Corns haven’t advertised it.
Their pose is still that nothing can go
wrong in the Workers’ Paradise, the best
of all possible worlds, where the men are
all wonderful and the women all beautiful.
They could have got wheat from this
country if they had revealed part of the
appalling truth and asked for that sort of
Aid to Russia. Instead, they supported
“Labor” when “Labor” was paying Wes-
tralian farmers in good seasons upwards
of a million pounds sterling for not grow-
ing wheat.
Harrison challenged Chifley to “name
the owner of jewellery and cosmetics”
brought to Sydney by a young woman
from America in or after a Government
job, and seized (gems and make-up, not
the young woman) by the Customs. No
answer being vouchsafed, Harrison
asserted that Chifley knew the name, but
would not reveal it “because the person
involved was a Senator.”
Electioneering in Queensland, Chifley
blithered about a Commonwealth-
Queensland agreement for opening up the
Blair Athol coalfields, building a new
railway to Gladstone to handle the coal
and mechanising the whole shebang from
opencut to ship’s hold. He added that
Blair Athol had about 400,000,000 tons
of coal and that development of the
measure would assist home consumption
and export. Then, just when the North
was becoming slightly excited, came the
typical Chifley damper: “It will be some
time before we can get this scheme going,
as it is a long-term national project.”
The North, having heard things like that
before, pulled its hat over its eyes and
went soberly back to work.
When in Westralia, Chifley harked back
to the old Freetrade sentiments of the
State in which he was born and bred and
delivered himself of this;
Very much will have to be imported.
When conditions are stabilised Australia
will have to import goods to the value o£
£200,000,000 annually to maintam the
standard the people will want. And as the
population grows and standards become
still higher this amount will increase.
Two hundred millions for a beginning!
Nearly double the value of imports
of merchandise in 1938-39! And here is
Ward promising the removal of indirect
taxes. Customs duties are indirect taxes
with the protective incidence without
which many industries would collapse.
Neither gentleman would dare to say any-
thing of the sort in a fortress of Protec-
tion like Ballarat.
Another Maxie, Julius by surname, is
the Communist candidate for Wide Bay
(Q.), and this Maxie has announced that
“We Communists have not forgotten the
New Order promises made so lavishly
when things looked black for Australia.’
This Maxie is about to find that Aus-
tralians have not forgotten Com-
munist disloyalty and sabotage of Aus-
tralia’s war effort up to June 21, 1941,
nor subsequent Communist doings in
ships, coalmines, iron and steel works,
meatworks, power plants and on the
waterfront.
Dedman, who has no use for the house-
less “little capitalists” who, when the war
was on, were promised heaps of Gov-
ernment houses irrespective of their
condition, was asked by Melbourne
“Argus” whether he thought it right that
his Government should offer an atom-
research scientist less than a wharfie’s pay.
This was his reply, published in the third
person:
Mr. Dedman said he would not en-
courage the belief that people already paid
adequate salaries should get still greater
salaries. If anyone should receive higher
remuneration it was those on the lower-
income scale. These should be raised
before others are placed on a better basis.
What a humbug Deddie is! His own
salary as member is £lOOO a year, and as
Minister he gets another £l2OO with free
transport and other privileges. And for
five months, March to August, he drew
another £1 2s. 6d. per sitting day. This
grant, placing members and Ministers
“on a better basis” permanently, was an-
nounced by Chifley on March 6. Did
Dedman object? He did not.
The British representative on the
U.N.O. Security Council, replying to the
Russian allegation—made by permission
of Our Foreign Policy, which “abstained'
—that Greece, threatened by Russia and
the Slav satellites, is a danger to peace:—
The danger to peace is the incessant
propaganda from Moscow against the
British Commonwealth, and the incessant
utilisation of Communist parties in every
country as a means to attack British people
and the British Government.
There is one country in which the Com-
munist party is free to carry on this
poisonous propaganda, and meanwhile to
sabotage industry and transport and Our
Foreign Policy. This country.
Washington (U.S.A.) has got hold of a
yarn that the real Tito, having failed to
satisfy Moscow, was liquidated in 1942
and a Russian General named Lebedev, a
dead-spit of the original, was given his
name and set up in his place. It is a
fact that a Yugoslav delegate to the Pans
“Peace” Conference spoke his piece in
Russian. But Tito or Lebedev, what does
it matter to the victims of Communist
tyranny in Yugoslavia or to the Ameri-
can airmen who were murdered in their
transport ’planes?


THE SQUATTER.
“Move over, Comrades!”

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Oliver Filter”: I suppose the Army
and Navy were afflicted with similar
things, but in the Air Force they were
called Discrepancy Reports. They were
“raised” when any section or unit
found that it unaccountably lacked or
possessed anything from a pair of over-
alls to a three-ton truck. “D.Rs.” passed
for comment or explanation from person
to person, section to section and unit to
unit, slowly developing into massive
foolscap files that were the despair of
accounting officers, and the nearest thing
to perpetual motion ever designed by
man. Some seemed to travel for years
and visit every capital in Australia. I
cherish the memory of one which was
raised at Darwin when 12 bottles of
“wine, communion,” disappeared during
a short journey from one unit to another.
The report finally went to the Pharma-
ceutical Officer of No. 9 Stores Depot
(how or why I don’t know). I can’t re-
member the full and admirable summary
of the affair which he appended to the
report, but I know it concluded that
“since it is impossible to determine
whether the missing goods have been
used for purposes sacramental or sacri-
legious, it is recommended that they be
written off to the Glory of God at Public
Expense.” And there the matter rested.
“Coongan”: At times the R.A.A.F.
was very like the “civil service.” One
small radar station in the wilds of
n.-Westralia, well over a thousand miles
by air from Perth, was amused to receive
a “postagram” from a stores depot in that
city asking what were the station’s fire-
wood requirements in (a) sawn blocks,
and (b) six-foot lengths, A further posta-
gram from the same depot inquiring why
the devil the first one hadn’t been an-
swered almost tempted the C.O. to order
a few tons. The same C. 0., finding him-
self short of some “Orders,” wrote to
Area H.Q. in Perth asking for them. In
reply he received a wordy admonition
stating that, in applying for copies of
Orders, he would have to follow the
correct procedure as laid down in Order
No. XYZ. Yes, Order No. XYZ was one
of the several for which he was asking.

“Kathrine Desmond”: The compound
was filled with excited Indians talking and
gesticulating as they awaited the arrival
of a fresh convoy —friends and possibly
relatives not seen since their release from
Wewak. The crunch of wheels on the
gravel announced the arrival of the first
ambulance. The crowd surged forward —
all but one —a Sikh. Tall, proud and
aloof, he stood with folded arms, regard-
ing this display of emotion with cool in-
difference. The men climbed out of the
ambulance and were engulfed in a sea of
turbans. Lastly came the stretcher cases.
As the first man was lifted down, there
was a full-throated cry as through the
crowd dashed the Sikh. He knelt beside
the stretcher; then, disregarding the
medical staff, he picked up the man in
his arms and carried him to a vacant bed.
It was his brother, long thought dead.

“Armack”: Having just bougjit new

was a trifle annoyed when I switched on

Turning the knob frantically I was sur-

Reverting to my original station I was
just in time to hear “You have just been

“Cine Ma”: Prize bore of our suburb
is a young man who used to tell the

“Is that ‘Magic qPublications'? Listen — there's a page missing
out of this book."
recount every detail of the latest passion-
ate affair of Ray Milland and Paulette
Goddard. One day an irascible fellow-
passenger turned on him and told him
that the best thing that could happen to
him was that he would wake up one
morning and find that he had lost his
memory of events to as far back as the
year the talkies were invented. The un-
fortunate young raconteur sat silent for
the rest of the journey, but the next time
I met him he started on a long narrative
which he told me was an actual occur-
rence. It gradually dawned on me that
he was describing the plot of a picture
that had been “released” the previous
Friday. He still tells the stories of the
films he has seen but he now tells them
as true stories,

“Mick O’Pick”: Visiting surgeons to
St. George District Hospital (N.S.W.)
use a side entrance because of conveni-
ence of parking space. Over this
entrance, which frames the impressive
line-up of limousines sporting the well-
known medical car disk, is a large notice:
St. George District Hospital,

“B. A. Ker”: Another fallacy con-
cerning criminals (B. 28/8/’46) con-
cerns their loyalty to each other.
In actual fact “Thou shalt not
squeal” is about as consistently obeyed
as “Thou shalt not steal.” The
most noticeable characteristic I have ob-
served among his Majesty’s guests is
their mutual distrust. The fellow who
would cease talking loudly to whisper
“Top-off” When another “crim” ap-
proached would be —according to the
other fellow —“the biggest pimp in the
place.” The best of mates don’t leave their
tobacco or money about lest the tempta-
tion to “touch it off” should prove too
strong. One of the most savage fights in
the history of Parramatta jail was
caused by the repudiation of a debt of
honor after a race broadcast. Then
there was the high-minded inmate who
stormed for three days because in his
absence some “dirty bludger” had
“hoisted” £5 out of his mother’s purse.
The stickler for principle was doing three
years for robbery with violence.

“Manihii”; Maryborough (Q.) has a
livewire Scots Club which once a
week attends to an excellent half-
hour of Scottish music from record-
ings ‘in both languages, the Gaelic
and the uncouth dialect of the
Sassenach, from the local radio
station. The compere speaks in an ac-
cent as broad as the Mary River. On a
recent night listeners were given a laugh
when at the end of the session the com-
pere, in broad but doleful accents, men-
tioned that among the, requests sent in
there was one asking for three Gaelic
tunes. The Scots Club regretted that it
was unable to broadcast the numbers as
the writer had written in Gaelic and no
one could read it. “Hooiver, if he writes
tae us agin in English we wull be ainly
too pleased tae play the sangs he wants.”

“Meekatharra”: Since last December
R.A.A.F. Dakotas have flown 7,000,000
miles and Catalinas 1,500,000 miles with
neither fatality nor injury. It’s a nice
record and confirmation (though none is
needed) of the war-time performances of
those two types of aircraft. Dakotas
(known variously as Dougs, DC3s or
C47s) were the finest of all air transports,
and it’s my bet that in that capacity they
did as much to win the war as any other
’plane. Unarmed, they carried supplies,
troops, casualties and a dozen other
cargoes with only the skill of their pilots
to save them from attack. They carried
on their good work by going into prison
camps and making long flights back to
Australia and M.L. with the men. The
record of the Cats is an equally proud
one. From Australia they ranged as far
as the China coast and the Philippines on
reconnaissance, bombing, minelaying,
carrying out air-sea rescue missions and
“cloak and dagger” visits to enemy-
occupied territory. With the C47s, the
Cats were probably the safest and most
trustworthy aircraft in the s.-w. Pacific,
and their crews stacked up almost
fabulous hours bringing p.-0.-w. back
to Australia. The first Catalina to
go into operation in the S.W.P.A.
A24-1, “The Old Lady”—was still fly-
ing when the war ended. She finally went
in at East Arm, Darwin, where her hull
was ripped open while she was taking off
for Singapore with members of a p.-0.-w.
reception unit and Red Gross and medi-
cal supplies.

“Philp”: I left the office and walked
up Sydney’s George-street to catch a tram
home —a routine which I’ve been follow-
ing for approximately 300 days In every
year. After 10 minutes’ waiting I be-
came impatient; after 20 minutes, during
which several taxis cruised invitingly
close to the kerb, I began to suspect that
the Transport Commissioner was in
league with the taximen; after half an
hour I began cursing the Minister for
Transport and worked right through to
the Premier’s grandparents. Then, ]ust
when I’d decided to register my protest
by throwing myself under the first tram
that arrived instead of getting into it, I
noticed that there were no tram lines in
the street —I had walked one block past
my usual waiting-place and taken up
position on a corner never passed by
trams. Will some student of Freud please
explain—observing that I said I left the
office ?

“Macßopus”; I think I can answer
“Eve’s” query (B. 4/9/’46). It was an
expression of admiration for a completely
natural person to be described as un-
sophisticated. But in an artificial age, a
person who was unaffected and natural
came to be looked on as a “dill,” and
bright young things assumed that, if such
a person was unsophisticated, then a
sophisticated person was just the
opposite; in their ignorance the word
meant “smart, knowing, up to date.”
“Craiser”: I don’t know when “sophis-
ticated” acquired a complimentary mean-
ing (B, 4/9/’46), but I would like to
know how “dirty big” entered the ranks
of romantic courtship. A young man
entered a Collins-street tram, and, his
face lightening with pleasure, raised his
hat and took his seat alongside a damsel
who exuded an aroma charged with all
the arts of the perfumier, plus a large
posy of jonquils and pansies. “You
smell,” he said, in a voice vibrating with
affection, “like a dirty big garden.”

“Laetitia”: On occasion the . Yanks
might have been a bit better off for a
bit of that red tape which they tradi-
tionally scorned. In the puking days of
one N.G. base a change in the supply
plan transferred from the Yanks to the
Australians the handling of bulk supplies.
The Yanks scouted the idea of a stock-
taking, did not want any formal hand-
ing over, and declared that there were
three months’ supplies on hand. The red-
tape-shackled Australians, possibly fear-
ful of the future D.F.O. wallahs, insisted
on a detailed stocktaking, whictt dis-
closed not 90 but about nine days’ tucker
on hand. But for the immediate action
which followed this “slavish” adherence
to red tape the story of the Jap landing at
Milne Bay, which took place about three
weeks later, might have been different.

“Nairda”; Melbourne’s first Royal
Show for seven years will be devoid of
two of its biggest old-time attractions —
sideshows will be definitely out and
“samples” will be greatly restricted.
Rows of temporary Housing Commission
homes cover , the area once occupied by
the pin-headed man, the fat lady, the
greatest boxing troupe on earth and other
sideshows. There is little likelihood of this
land being returned to the public for
years, and R.A.S. officials have declared
their hearty approval. Shortages of tin-
plate, labor and, often, their own pro-
duct are the reasons given by firms for
the non-appearance of their samples. A
merry-go-round will be the only carnival
concession. The Show will thus be quite
a disappointment for younger fry, who
have yet to see a real show.

“F.S.”: The bafflement of “Clooter” at
the attitude of the modem art critic and
his queer phraseology is understandable
(B. 4/9/’46). He should get some satis-
faction from the thought that critics
are just as bewildered as the layman,
although, perhaps, they don’t know it.
I read four papers daily and I have never
yet known all the four critics employed by
those sheets to be in complete agreement
about a particular artist or picture;
generally they are in disagreement with
one another. I have come to the con-
clusion that they aren’t really talking
about the pictures, but about their own
feelings. When I hear | a certain waltz
performed I get a thrill of pleasure,
although I know that the waltz is a par-
ticularly ordinary piece of music which
has long gone out of fashion. I was
courting my wife when it was at the
height of its popularity. The thrill I get
is produced, not by the music but by
the memory of the pleasant feelings I
had at that time. It symbolises my
budding manhood. To another person it
might symbolise something different and
he might get a feeling of revulsion when
he heard it. I wouldn’t be a bit sur-
prised if these four critics who pontificate
so confidently about pictures are in the
same position.

“Ad Rem”: That idea of making
souvenirs of pens used for signing im-
portant documents didn’t begin with
General MacArthur (B. 24 /7/ ’4 6).
Franklin Roosevelt would be nearer the
mark. F.D.R., when notifying an
appointee to an important post, would
take the “official” pen and write “This
is the pen which gives you a new job for
the U.5.A.,” then poke the pen through
the paper and mail it off to the lucky
guy.
KING CRICKET.
“An English paper forecasts that news of the doings
of Hammond’s team in Australia will presently ‘be
giving a radiance to the dampest and foggiest morn-
ing.’ ”
Seated at their breakfast tables they’ll be soon
immersed in cables
Furnishing the very latest news and all the
dinkum oil
Incidental to revivals of the strife ’twixt ardent
rivals
“Linked together”—as some poet sings—“in
cricket’s manly toil.”
There’ll be stuff to thrill their senses more than
peace-time conferences
With the singularly little comfort that such
powwows bring;
And the problems facing nations with their
infinite vexations
Will be sidetracked for discussions on the
realm where Cricket’s king.
Attlee’s, Bevin’s, Churchill’s, Eden’s eloquence
will yield precedence
As material for headlines, cause for either
woe or whoop,
To the long-awaited clashes for the legendary
Ashes
To determine whether England or Australia’s
in the soup.
Men will speculate if Compton, Edrich too,
will be as prompt on
Belting boundaries at Sydney and at Mel-
bourne as they should,
And be heard debating whether Wright or
Bedser with the leather
Will effect as much as Hammond or as
Hutton with the wood.
Here, too, in the mornings, brother, when the
sultry dust-storms smother,
And insatiable summer tends to get your
spirits down,
Think of the invigorating influences doubtless
waiting
In the wizardry of Bradman, or it may be
Barnes and Brown.
When the frothing and the bubbling politicians
finish troubling
And pernicious party passions cease to
agitate our breasts,
We can fix our comprehensions on more genial
contentions.
Perfectly pacific struggles for supremacy in
Tests.
Let the merits of our bowlers elbow out the
tax-controllers
And their programmes as the subject for
intelligent debate,
And the pundits hazard guesses whether
googlies or expresses
Are the most antagonistic when the bat is
firm and straight.
Soon we’ll lightly turn our fancies unto cuts
and drives and glances,
Sizzling shots that pierce the covers, smacks
that sound and snicks that shine,
Everything that bears relation to our racial
recreation,
With one prohibition only, videlicet bodyline.

T. THE R.


“Bo”: I had accounted the greatest
hazards in restaurant feeding, especially
in hashhouses of confined space, to be
the spearing of bullet-hard peas with a
blunt fork and endeavors to get through
the casehardening of a roast spud with
the piece of hoop-iron they put opposite
the fork —until I watched the fellow next
to me trying to make a brace of wan,
emaciated-looking snags a little palatable
by dosing them with tomato sauce. Gin-
gerly he gave the bottle a shake,
evidently having been stung before when
handling one of the devilish contraptions.
No sauce. He shook it harder ; a pinhead
drop emerged. Then he upended it and
tapped gently, obviously fearing an ava-
lanche, Another pinhead drop. He hit
harder ; I’ll swear I heard a mocking laugh
come from the bottle. Then, enraged, the
diner gave the bottom of the bottle a
terrific swipe. About half the contents
shot on to his plate, scoring a near-miss
with the snorks ; then it ricocheted, com-
ing to rest on the fawn topcoat of a
middle-aged dame at a near-by table as
she bent down to ingurgitate her soup.
Blissfully unaware of the disaster she
kept her head down. My diner, after
calmly studying the result of his efforts,
doggedly started in to massage the
mysteries with what remained of the
sauce. After polishing them off he
reached for his hat. “Aren’t you going to
tell her?” whispered his cobber. The
other shook his head. “Y’ can see she’s
come in to enjoy a day in town,” he said.
“It’d spoil her day if I told her.” That’s
what I call consideration.

“Jachris” goes travelling:—•
The Douglas which opened the Government-
controlled T.A.A. service —an “interim”
schedule as yet, it is planned by the first week
in October to run two trips a day each way
between Melbourne and Sydney and another to
include Brisbane, with that growing and spread-
ing in another month —was named Hawdon.
The policy is to name all machines after Aus-
tralian explorers, and Joseph Hawdon, though
his existence was questioned by The Bulletin’s
quizmaster and is not acknowledged by
The Australian Encyclopaedia, has some claims
to be included among those honored and one
real claim to be named first. He, in 1837,
tendered for the first overland carriage of mails
“ Edward, darling, it's your looks that count with me,
not your silly old money!”
between Melbourne and Yass, the furthest
outpost of the N.S.W. postal service at that
time. He was given the contract at £l2OO
per annum.
Hawdon employed a young man named John
Conway Burke as mailman between Melbourne
and the Murray (then called the Hume), and
Burke has left, in the Albury “Border Post”
of August 20, 1897, a graphic account of his
first journey. He told how on Jan. 1, 1838,
he left Mejbourne on a slow horse with “151bs.
of Her Britannic Majesty’s mail.” At Granite
Range his mount received a spear in its back
and “galloped several miles” before he was
able to stop it and cut the spear out. He
pushed on, but crossing the Hume the unhappy
prad stuck fast in the mud. Burke took ott
the saddle and mailbag, but still could not free
the horse. He had to swim for it, then set
out to walk to “Mr. Wetherall’s station at
Howlong.” While struggling along he was
attacked by a “pack of 50 dogs” which came
upon him “like a tornado.” Burke with his
mailbag climbed a gum-tree. A little later one
Wetherall arrived with a gun which he pointed
at the then “near-naked” Burke and ordered
him down. When Burke explained that he
was the mailman Wetherall dissolved in laugh-
ter. They went back for the horse, managed
to get it unstuck, but before they could lead
it ashore it was drowned.
A most intriguing story, but unfortunately
Hawdon himself, who left a diary, knew nothing
of it. He claimed to have accompanied Burke
on the first trip with the mails. Nothing un-
toward occurred and 31 days out' from “the
site of Scott’s Hotel” in Melbourne they met
“the mailboy from Yass.”
There were no adventures to record for
posterity in the T.A.A.’s first run.
“Pitt St”: Expansion of air travel
seems likely to set another problem for
those already engaged in solving Sydney’s
traffic tangles. Most of the existing air-
lines have their offices in the city’s Majtin-
place the just-inaugurated Common-
wealth Government one is by itself in
Phillip-street, probably because it couldn’t
get into Martin-place. And since passen-
gers and their luggage start from there
for the aerodrome it’s a common sight
any morning to see half a dozen big buses
parked along the kerb, and frequently
with them are the vehicles of the various
road transport companies that run inter-
state and holiday road tours. As time
goes on and more and more people take
to the air and roads, there’ll be jams there
to equal the existing ones in other parts
of the city. Martin-place was never in-
tended to be a picking-up place for
travellers, and amidst all the talk about
town-planning it seems strange that no
attention has been given to the necessity
of establishing some sort of a centre for
the arrival and departure of air and road
passengers.

“Youanmi”; Anyone know the origin
of “doover”? A friend tells me the word
was in use as far back as 1932, and was
generally used “to describe any mech-
anical contraption that defied descrip-
tion,” I first heard it used in the Army,
where it seemed to be applied to anything
from a tent-pole to a salt-shaker, accord-
ing to the speaker’s fancy. In the
R.A.A.F. it became the accepted term for
the “batcatcher” (the actual technical in-
stallation) on radar stations —official and
semi-technical publications used the word
freely. Now an acquaintance who was a
p.-0.-w. in Burma tells me that he and
his fellows first heard the word during
their confinement, and used it to describe
some of the barely edible concoctions
which they were able to add to their
normal rations. Their cook’s theory was
that the word derived from hors d’oeuvres,
but, although that’s a bright bit of etymo-
logy, I doubt if it’s accurate.

“Jasby”: I notice from the cables that
an English picture theatre showed a news-
reel of Airborne winning the St, Leger
several days before the race was run.
The film people’s explanation was that
when Airborne won the Derby they
thought him a good thing for the other
race so they prepared an advance film
showing him passing “a winning post.”
This was inadvertently sent out with the
current newsreel. A man I sat next to
in a Brisbane
theatrette two years
ago will sneer if he
reads that report.
The race we saw on
that .occasion was a
“flash” of the 1944
Melbourne Cup,
won by Sirius. Dur-
ing the running the
commentator said
“Watch San Martin.
He stumbles and
falls behind.” Actu-
ally San Martin had
broken a leg and
had to be destroyed
after the race. The
cove sitting next to
me snorted. “It’s a
fake,” he said to me.
I took no notice,
but he was insistent.
“It’s a fake,” he re-
peated. “TTus film’s
supposed to be
meant for the boys
in the islands and
the dirty cows think
they can put any-
thing over them. Tire crooks.” He
went on to explain that he had heard
the Cup Day broadcast, and that the mis-
hap to San Martin was not known until
after the race. His point was that by
drawing the audience’s attention to the
fact during the race the commentator was
somehow cheating. 1 avoided further
argument on the plea that I wanted to
see the rest of the programme, but as he
shuffled past me later he fired a parting
shot, “Some of youse blokes’ll believe
anything. You’ll wake up to yourself
some day.” Reverting to the St. Leger,
Airborne did win it.

“Wusslean”; The friendliest tribute to
H. G. Wells that I have yet read was,
curiously enough in view of Wells’ anti-
pathy to most aspects of organised reli-
gion, that of a Methodist clergyman, who
devoted the whole of his weekly column
“I will...Now, no more questions till I finish this row. "
in a Victorian newspaper to the writer’s
work and personality.. The clergyman-
journalist mentioned that on the only
occasion on which h# met Wells the latter
said his favorite piece of writing was the
tale, “The Green Door in the White Hall,”
which coincided with the parson’s own
preference. The thing that struck me
most, though, was the headline to this
kindly article. It read: “H. G, Wells in
Heaven.” I’d like to hear just what
Wells thinks of that!

“Zake”: I hoist my hat to Soviet mili-
tary intelligence. True, when the two
Fiihrers were bosom pals Adolf knew
all about the .condition—or lack of it —
of the Soviet army while Joe had to wait
until the Wehrmacht was halfway to
Moscow before he was made aware that
the High Command didn’t have most o v f
its troops tied up on the Channel, in the
occupied countries and North Africa.
Also, a spot of spying in Canada by a
Colonel Zabotin, who died of a “heart
attack” three days after being recalled
to Moscow for explanations, seemed to
have been messed up. But you’ve got
to hand it to them on their latest work.
Field-Marshal Montgomery’s visit to
Canada brought forth from the Kremlin
the usual tirade of that now-hated
Dominion’s sinister plans for starting
World War 111, and ended with a solemn
belief that “Field-Marshal Lord Mont-
gomery is in Canada on military matters.”
This brilliant piece of ratiocination com-
pletely explodes the notion generally held
in Empire circles that Monty was over
there as a competitor in the Open Ping
Pong Championship.

“Findy”: From America comes the re-
port of the establishment of a college for
smokers. “Professors” of this latest seat of

votees the correct way to hold a cigarette,
the knack of tapping it on the packet
with an air of knowing what it’s all about,
how to exhale in a steady blow instead of
allowing the smoke to sneak out through
the comers of the mouth or exfiltrate
through the moustache. Other points to
which notice will be given are how to
keep the fingers free from stain and how
to keep the smoke out of the smoker’s
hair. Nothing seems to have been over-
looked —except the problem of getting the

“Kennis”: When Dutchman Kees
Boeke, at the International Education
Conference, spoke out against caning he
brought to my mind my own experiences
at the receiving end of a stick. If caning
was an art among teachers of my day
the receiving of a walloping was more so.
Each pupil had his own ideas about how
to stop its hurting, the right way to hold
the hand, or what preliminary prepara-
tion would help to lessen the pain. One
young hopeful in my class could nof
break himself of the habit of poking out
his tongue as the blow was about to fall
(quite often that tongue-poking touched
the teacher’s sense of humor and contri-
buted to a peaceful settlement); another
invariably raised his leg at each blow;
another persistently pulled his hand away
at the right moment so that the teacher
walloped himself on the leg; the
“wag” of the class, a lad with the skin
of a rhinoceros, never failed to leap in
the air at each whack. So-called pain-
killers were plentiful. Resin rubbed into
the hand was said to do wonders as was
an eraser rubbed well into the palm.
Blowing on the hand after the caning
was sworn to by some as an infallible
pain-stopper. But if there was an effec-
tive remedy, and I think I tried them all,
I can’t recall laughing to myself after any
caning I had.

“Morehead”: One non-smoker I know
—an ex-serviceman—has found a way of
getting rid of his monthly quota of
smokes and placating his conscience. On
the first Friday of every month he raffles
his supply, selling most of the tickets to
the slanders in queues outside tobacco-
nists in the district at 6d. per ticket. After
deducting what the tobacco cost him he
hands the balance to a charity.

“Simon”: One thing the spread of edu-
cation has failed to do is improve our
calligraphy. Compared with the work
once done by quills, our writing is atroci-
ous. Typewriters have contributed to
this. First essential to a freehand is hold-
ing the pen with index finger almost
straight along the pen. If this is not
insisted upon in the primary classes the
technique is hard to acquire later. Of
high-school students making notes in
trams and trains nine out of ten will have
the vital finger cramped over the writ-
ing medium with a bend in it like a toper’s
elbow, the writing reflecting the angled
crampness. I went to a school presided
over by an old Scotchman who insisted
upon the correct “holt.” Of the many
soldiers, sailors, tinkers, tailors and a few
toffs turned out, all could write a pass-
able fist.

“F.M.”; British and Aussie p.-0.-w. were
engaged in constructing a concrete bridge
near Graz in Austria in 1943. Work-
ing under an Italian foreman they did a
grand job of sabotage and got away with
it. The Itie foreman wasn’t quite so
lucky. Alongside the bridge the Ger-
mans 4 had dumped a large number of
drums of petrol. As the concrete-mixer
was worked entirely by the prisoners it
was fairly easy to substitute petrol for
water in the mixture, the empty drums
being refilled with water. The job com-
pleted, some weeks later it was inspected
by a high-ranking officer of the Todt
organisation, who pronounced it set for
railway traffic. Two days later a loco-
motive drawing two trucks of bricks was
sent to “test” the bridge. There came a
mighty rumble, a cloud of dust and a
huge splash as loco, and trucks crashed
into the river, together with the bridge.
Many were the questions asked of the
p.-0.-w. by the Jerries, but as always
they “nicht verstehn.” They didn’t ask
the Itie. They acted.
THE TWO-UP PLAYER’S PLAINT.
“Four or five two-up schools were raided in
Sydney and suburbs, and it was announced that the
police were determined to stamp out the game.”
State lotteries flourish wheresoe’er you turn
Inviting one and all to have a fly.
Sound citizens draw marbles from a churn
Quite soberly and unashamedly
To settle who should gamer dough thereby,
Blind chance, of course, determining the dip;
Yet Law regardeth with a baleful eye
The game of tossing pennies from a kip.
Übiquitous, the s.p. bookies earn
Their bread well-buttered, too, you may
rely—
Through subterfuges viewed with scant concern
By guardians of our morality.
The bulls and bears on ’Change serenely ply
Their trades in amicable fellowship.
Why should it be a misdemeanor, why,
The sport of whirling coppers from a kip?
Whoever, you may bet, has bunce to burn
Will seek and find some fire»to burn it by,
And soon or late inevitably learn
He isn’t half as slick and cute and spry
As practising will make him by and by
When he secures on it a tighter grip—
A thesis that may possibly apply
Even to heading pennies from a kip.
All life’s a gamble incontestably.
Why should it come beneath the legaL whip,
The sort of pitch-and-toss that’s known as
“swy,”
The game of spinning coppers from a kip?

THE SERVICE MAN
"Man of Action."
“Ek Dum”; The pair of goat horns
for the most colossal piece of election
effrontery should be awarded without
question to the Right Hon. Francis
Michael Forde. Opposed by two fighting
soldiers, the Right Hon. is wooing votes
by means of a picture-theatre slide trans-
ferred to a leaflet. Overshadowed by the
tall form of General MacArthur, the
Right Hon. figures as a Man of Action,
the full legend being; “Men of Action —
Vote 1 Forde —the Labor Candidate of
Whom Capricornia Is Proud.”
On the basis of the Right Hon.’s
record the advertisement would be a fine
addition to the repository of Australian
national humor if anybody could think
humorously about the consequences of
past “actions,” some of which were as
follows:
(1) The Government was urged to
secure the withdrawal of troops from a
hopeless position at Singapore, as troops
were withdrawn from Gallipoli. Had this
been done thousands of lives would have
been saved and Australia’s and India’s
fighting forces at a critical stage would
have been greatly augmented. Instead, the
Right Hon. informed the doomed defen-
ders of Singapore that succor was on the
way, “not as a few consignments from a
shrinking store, but as a stream which will
swell to a flood, and a flood which will
grow into an overwhelming torrent.” It is
common knowledge that thousands of the
Eighth Division died or were wrecked in
health after untold sufferings.
(2) Earle Page has made the accusation,
and it has not been answered, that “my
brother, the Acting Administrator in New
Guinea, together with 22 missionaries and
600 other civilians and members of the
administrative staff, was lost because he
could not get an answer to his appeals,
spread over a fortnight, for instructions
by the Australian Labor Government to
use shipping lying at Rabaul to evacuate
these people before the Japanese arrived.”
(3) The Right Hon.’s Government left at
Rabaul and elsewhere in New Guinea a
half-trained militia unit without air cover
or naval support or even sufficient arms
to meet the Japanese invasion. Many of
them became human sacrifices.
(4) When General Wavell took command
of the defence of the North, including Aus-
tralia’s northern coastline, the Right Hon.
and his Government had 15,000 militia
troops in the North. They made it clear that
■ if it were deemed necessary to send these
men to fight in the Indies to keep the
Japanese off these shores it could not be
done. And their Government must be held
accountable for the sacrifice of the men
of Ambon and Java who were only allowed
to go there because they were volunteers
of the A.I.F. Their numbers and equip-
ment were such that their fate was sealed
from the first.
(5) The Right Hon. and his Government
refused to lend the Seventh Division, on
its way from the Middle East, to General
Alexander’s command to ensure the hold-
ing of Burma, even though thd British and
Americans gave a solemn pledge that they
would immediately send a division to fill
the gap in Australia left by the delay in
returning the division.
(6) It was reserved for the Man of Action
to proclaim that he intended to cast over-
board army methods and prepare troops
for battle in three weeks from the rookie
stage!
(7) The Right Hon. and his Government
ignored the warnings of the possibility
of a raid on Darwin. They left that place
without adequate civil defence, despite the
urgent pleas of its member, A. M. Blain.
In the result the enemy was able to operate
against a virtually defenceless town and
large numbers of lives were unnecessarily
lost.
(8) The Right Hon. and his Government
thought it sufficient defence for the north
coast of Papua, when it was certain that
a Jap landing must be attempted, to leave
• across the Owen Stanley Range an inexperi-
enced and half-armed militia battalion cut
off by the ranges from help—another mass
human sacrifice when the Japanese landed.
(9) The Right Hon. and his Government,
with all the experience of 25 years of New
Guinea disease behind them, sent tens of
thousands of troops into a malaria and
scrub-typhus area without proper medical
preparation, without even a sufficiency of
mosquito nets, which were “scarce and of
inferior quality” (Brigadier Fairley). In
the result there were awful casualties from
tropical diseases.
(10) The Right Hon. and his Government
were found wanting again at Milne Bay.
The force at that vital point when the Japs
came was largely madp up of raw, untrained
militia which scarcely knew one end of a
rifle from another. Thus it nearly allowed
the enemy to make a landing on the
southern as well as the northern side of
the Papuan ranges.
(11) The Right Hon. and his Government
were panicked by newspaper strategists into
the Kokoda-frail campaign—a futile opera-
tion which cost hundreds of valuable lives
and thousands of disease casualties among
the flower of Australian troops.
(12) The Right Hon. and his Government
left Wau in such a position of defence
after Buna-Gona (where “a huge outbreak
of malaria occurred among troops not
equipped to protect themselves and
thoroughly exhausted and underfed’
Fairley) that only a diversion ot
American airpower saved the goldfield.
Saved it by a hairbreadth and rescued its
defenders at the last moment from the
fate which had befallen the defenders of
Rabaul.
(13) The Government of which the Right
Hon. was a member failed to make any
preparations worth the name for the coming
of the Royal Navy. In 1940-41 “Labor” had
fiercely opposed the building of the Sydney
Graving Dock. Its neglect left the R.N.
without a training aerodrome for its fleet
fliers. It permitted a condition of affairs
at the Sydney Naval Base which compelled
Admiral Fraser to send his destroyers to
Auckland to be reconditioned, and which
so held up R.N. operations that the British
seriously considered fleeing from the
“Labor” zone of influence to the first base
outside Australia which offered.
(14) The Dutch abandoned their islands
at the specific request of the Australian
Government in the interests of Australian
defence. After the war they were aban-
doned by the same Government at the
behest of Communists in Australia and in
the N.E.1., sponsors of native Quislings and
Jap pupils in sedition.
There are many other counts which
could be cited —neglect of the fighting
troops and of the occupation force in
Japan; failure to attempt rescue of the
Sandakan captives; huge waste and
wanton extravagance in every field and
abject surrender to larrikinism and law-
lessness—but these are the main ones.
They have been topped off at the moment
by the Right Hon.’s capitulation to law-
less “squatters” at the Holland Park
Military Hospital, Brisbane. After the
Army had cut off the gas and electricity,
he had them turned on again in token
of his “humanitarianism.”
It is a poor record at best, and one for
which the Army Minister and his associ-
ates will have to answer at the bar of
public opinion if ever there is a public
inquiry into their “actions” during the
war period. No wonder that General
MacArthur’s staff showed some “terse-
ness” when asked whether the general
had sanctioned the use of the “Man of
Action” photograph as an election dodge.
Case of Major Cousens.
At the Central Police Court, Sydney,
Major Cousens was in the box the entire
week to September 13.
He began by stating that before his
removal to Tokyo, after he had been at
Changi, Captain Geldard had said, in the
presence of Lieut.-Colonel Anderson,
that G.O.C. A.I.F. in Malaya wanted him
(Major Cousens) to broadcast that A.I.F.
survivors were safe and being reason-
ably well treated. After objecting on
the ground that he did not want to let
the enemy know of his radio-station ex-
perience, he, Major Cousens, drafted a
message of which a record was made.
The Japs asked him to broadcast from
Singapore. He refused, then, and on sub-
sequent occasions. In May, 1942, he
left Changi for Mergui, Burma. Under
“an order from Imperial Army H.Q.,”
he returned to Singapore at the end of
June and was taken to Tokyo, arriving
on July 31.
At Kempei Tai H.Q. in Tokyo he was
punched and beaten. He was so weak
from starvation and dysentery and
so low and dispirited that he asked
for a revolver and a round of ammuni-
tion. He was again told he would have
to broadcast, and again he refused. Finally
he agreed to broadcast a list of the
names of his men in Burma. He was
taken to the English-speaking section of
the Tokyo broadcasting station and
given a script to broadcast that night.
It was “a violent personal attack on
President Roosevelt,” and he “made a
written refusal.”
Mr. Smyth (for accused) asked that
th£ refusal be produced in court. Mr.
Dovey said that accused’s statement was
the first the Crown knew of such a docu-
ment —“there is not, and never has been,
such a document in our possession.”
Major Cousens went on to say that
his continued refusals to broadcast in-
furiated Namikawa, an official of Tokyo
Radio, who “kept thumping me on the
knee and striking me on the chest and
saying ‘We can you sweep the
streets if necessary.’ ” Cousens replied
that he would be content to do that. “You
will not be shot,” Namikawa had said;
“you will be sent to Military Police for
punishment and we will bring a hundred
men here to broadcast if necessary.”
“At that point,” Major Cousens pro-
ceeded :
I was in such a condition physically and
mentally that I would have accepted a
clean death by shooting or beheading, but
I was afraid of torture. I knew that in
my condition it would only take at the
most a day or two of Kempei torture
before they had reduced me to a condition

INSTITUTE
80 Swanston Street, Melbourne
Australia s Foremost School of Commercial Art
in which no white man should ever appear
before Asiatics.
As far as I knew there was nobody else
among the men of the Eighth Division
who had any experience of broadcasting
comparable with mine. I thought that I
might as well see what I coufd do to
sabotage this Japanese propaganda and
that I had better submit, because other-
wise some other poor devil would have ter
go through the same thing after they had
finished with me.
After receiving the instruction from
Major Tsuneishi that “you will obey all
orders of the Japanese Imperial Army or
be executed,” witness went down to
broadcast, and read the script “much too
fast and in a flat meaningless monotone
from start to finish.” Namikawa was
“beside himself with rage.” Witness
read subsequent scripts in such a way
that they “were meaningless as propa-
ganda” and so that listeners would know
that he was “wrecking the broadcasts.”
He had tried to incorporate information
useful to the Allies because “I felt sure
that there would be the closest check on
anything broadcast from Japan, and that
especially anything spoken by me would
be meticulously examined for possible
information.” Major Cousens denied
that he had broadcast that Australia
should make a separate peace, that Mr.
Churchill was a warmonger or that Mr.
Roosevelt was in the hands of Jewish
financiers. He was taken off regular
broadcasting at the end of 1942.
As to the training of Japanese an-
nouncers :
I attempted to develop in them a style
that would create the utmost hostility in
America. By using Gray’s “Elegy” 1
taught them an “unintelligent monotonous
rhythm.” By playing the dagger scene
from “Macbeth” I tried to lead them into
a “ham-acting style.” I tried to preserve
the accent of American-Japanese announcers
because a fellow p.-0.-w. had told me
that Americans would be “hopping mad”
to hear them broadcasting.
Of the announcers he had trained,
Margaret Kato was opposed to Japanese
militarist rule and was unhappy in
Japan ; her one idea was to get back to
London. George Noda, educated in
British Columbia, was “very proud of
being a British citizen” —he, too, dis-
liked the military rule in Japan and the
war with America and wanted to go
home. Iva Toguri had told him
(Major Cousens) that she had to report
regularly to the Tokyo police because
she had refused to accept Japanese
citizenship—she was born and educated
in California and was “a completely
loyal American citizen.”
Major Cousens described Foumy
Saisho, the first Crown witness, as being
very different in the box from the person
she was in Tokyo. The staff of Radio
Tokyo had appeared very “wary and
frightened of her,” and he himself had
been extremely cautious because he had
decided that she was a Kempei Tai or
Army agent. Of the second Crown wit-
ness, Hiroshi Niino, Cousens said “We
placed him among the rabbits —which-
ever way the stream went.”
His main intentiofi in writing his com-
mentaries, witness continued, was to get
as much information across as he could.
They had no propaganda value at all
and were “the most dreadful nonsense,”
apart from such information and guid-
ance for the Allies as he tried to include
in them. In May, 1943, he had discovered
in Tokyo a distinct resentment against
the Army, and
I hoped that our propaganda to the
Japs would have taken the line which
would strengthen the case of the moderates.
It was my opinion that the Japs feared
the Americans. The type of propaganda
we were using then was playing right into
the hands of the Jap militarists, who were
using the threat of American brutality to
maintain control over the masses of the
Jap people.
According to witness, if the 1945 terms
of surrender had been offered in 1943 the
moderates would have been strengthened
and, in his opinion, could have defeated
the Tojo Government. There was no
doubt that such an offer in 1944 would
have finished the Var by causing a revo-
lution in Japan.
Montgomery in Normandy.
“Ek Dum”: Field-Marshal Mont-
gomery’s report on the operations in the
Normandy campaign seems to make clear
the respective roles of the British and
American armies, which have been in dis-
pute. “Colonel” Ingersoll, the Leftist
New York journalist, and officers of
General Eisenhower’s staff, authors of
hasty memoirs, have left it to be inferred
that the American break-through at St.
Lo, on the west of the Normandy line,
was a feat accomplished against over-
whelming odds, while the British on the
left flank before Caen were struggling in
the meshes of abject failure.
General Montgomery makes it clear
that the versions of the campaign de-
duced in these pages at the time of the
battle were exactly accurate. His plan as
overall commander was, after the land-
ing on the Normandy shore had been con-
solidated, to feint on the Caen sector, thus
drawing the bulk of the forces to the
British area, and then to make a break-
through on the western flank with the
American armies. There can be no dis-
pute about this plan,- since the Mont-
gomery dispatch and the documents
attached show that it was given out to
general officers on April 7, two months
before the landing, and was adhered to
until it was fulfilled.
The mechanical success of it, and the
burden which was thrust upon the British
fctrces, is shown by the figures:
On June 25 on Caumont-Caen sector
(British front), there were five Panzer
divisions, 530 tanks and 49 infantry bat-
talions. On the American front at that
date there was one Panzer division, 190
tanks and 87 infantry battalions.
A month later at the crucial period of
the break-through battle there were six
Panzer divisions, 645 tanks and 92 in-
fantry battalions on the British front.
On the American front there were two
Panzer divisions, 190 tanks and 85 in-
fantry battalions. Thus the British, with
the inferior force in armor and numbers,
were facing roughly four times the pres-
sure which the Americans were facing,
having regard to the proportions of the
different formations. Relatively the pres-
sure in the British sector was far heavier
when the disparity between the two Allied
forces was considered.
.The break-though in fact was a gift to
the Americans.
The success of the Montgomery plan
was all the greater since the Germans
were not taken by surprise.
Von Rundstedt had favored defence
by a crust of infantry on the coast, with
an infantry reserve cushion behind, a
hammer of strategic armored divisions in
reserve inland. He forced a compromise
on Rommel, who plumped for a decisive
action on the beaches, with the result
that insufficient infantry divisions were
kept in reserve and armor had to be
thrust into action prematurely. This was
the clinching factor in bringing the cam-
paign to an issue quickly.
The ghosts of German soldiery must be
cursing Rommel in thousands. The
Rundstedt plan had a chance of holding
the invaders till after the winter, and
Germany had so much up her sleeve in
long-range weapons, rockets, jet aircraft
and atomic surprises that a delay of a
few months might have changed the com-
plexion of the war.
Nothing From Repot.
“The Country party undertakes,” said
Mr. Fadden in his policy speech, “to re-
view the whole of the Re-establishment
Act In respect to repatriation benefits,
the Country party’s policy is that eligi-
bility for a pension shall be on the basis
of acceptance as physically fit for enlist-
ment, and any subsequent disability shall
be accepted as due to war services unless
medical evidence of a contrary nature is
established.”
That is good as far as it goes; here is
a case for Mr. Fadden to chew over
when reviewing repatriation.
A returned Digger developed some lung
trouble other than T.B. In very
poor circumstances, he went through a
terrible time, and, his wife nursing him,
existed on £2 2s, a week from a fund
(not repatriation), £1 per week of which
had to be paid in rent. The pair of them
have no other resources.
Eventually he had to be operated on,
and one of his lungs was removed. That is
how he is now; and, on top of that, his
wife has had to undergo a serious opera-
tion. And not a penny from Repat.
Yet if his lung trouble had been T.B.
this pitifully unfortunate Digger would
today be drawing a good pension! The
regulations make provision for T.B.
It is not the fault of Repat. It is
ruled by an Act, and has to comply,
which it does to the permitted limits.
It is the Act which denies this Digger
what every Australian would regard as
nothing more than his due.

probing the difficulties and problems of
munition production in war-time Britain.
Williams maintains that the lessons learnt
by management and labor during the
war, properly applied, can pull Britain
through the difficult period of reconstruc-
tion. The H.C. has two enthusiasms —a
pride in the British Parliamentary system
and the conduct of the Commons and a
belief that the reviving British export
trade is no mere temporary phenomenon,
but a genuine and lasting recovery that
will within a few years recoup, Britain
for all she lost in the war.
lan Sabey, lately Publicity Officer to
the Disposals Commission, has taken on
a similar job with Trans-Australia Air-
lines. lan is nothing if not versatile.
Bom in Australia, but educated in Eng-
land, he began his career in this country
in wool; during the depression he
hawked stockings and ovenware from
door to door. He left the Adelaide
“Advertiser” to serve with the Sixth
Division and distinguished himself in
Greece at T Beach, near the village of
Tolo. Partly because of the chaotic con-
ditions, but mostly through personal
qualities of leadership, he took command
of what was, in effect, a brigade, though
he was then only a staff-sergeant. But
men who took part in that rearguard
action were killed or captured, so no
official notice was taken. As a p.-0.-w, in
Germany Sabey did a fine job in un-
obtrusive but effective ways, and at Stalag
8B founded an underground newspaper,
“Stimmt.” The word, freely translated,
means “the good oil,” “the pukka gen,”
“the good griff.” And “Stimmt” was a
truly amazing journal: a digest of
rumors—no place is such a fertile
breeding-ground of rumors as a p.-0.-w.
camp—a sifter and analyser, and a
booster-of-morale. Incredibly, the Ger-
VOICE OF T.A.A.
mans never became aware of it. They
saw it, but possibly mistook it for one
of their own countless manifestoes.
Geoffrey Ward, out to capture the
swinging Brisbane seat next week, is a
1914-18 Digger who was wounded in
France while serving with the 15th Bat-
talion. After that war he founded his
own transport company and has built it
up into a flourishing concern. He’s a
believer in profit-sharing and has intro-
duced a practical scheme into his own
business. Ward has been a worker for
Brisbane Legacy for many years—he’s
a past-president—and has been on the
Queensland Council of R.S.L. In addi-
tion to dabbling in local politics as a
member of Coorparoo Shire Council and
Metropolitan Electricity Board for some
years, his favorite hobby is the Queens-
land Historical Society. He is hoping to
add something to the historical records
on September 28.
“X.S.”: The Prisoner of Chillon, im-
mortalised by Byron, had nothing on
James Frasef, who died at 92 the other
day in Pentridge. Besides paying a small
fortune in fines, he served 33 years in
jail in Victoria, N.S.W., Queensland and
S.A., appeared in 92 courts and was
convicted on 128 charges. His final sen-
tence was for larceny of two pairs of
socks worth Bs., and his final public
utterance was “A man’s nearly 100 and
they give him two months.” Then they
led him away.
Archbishop Le Fanu, who died in
Perth last week at 76, was the first
churchman outside the Sydney arch-
diocese to become Primate of Australia.
The honor came to him in 1935, when he
was elected Primate in succession to
Archbishop Wright, Born in Dublin, he
was ordained in 1894 and became a
curate in Poplar. An appointment as
chaplain to the Bishop of Rochester was
his first step towards gaiters and mitre.
He became coadjutor-bishop of Brisbane
in 1915, and archbishop of Perth in 1929.
Australian bishops will choose his suc-
cessor towards the end of the year.
With 30 years’ experience of aviation in
all its branches, J. Stubbs, chief engineer
to A.N.A., recently returned from the
U.S.A. in a Skymaster. In World War I
he served with the A.F.C, as engineer,
observer and pilot, and after the Armis-
tice joined Larkin Sopwith as an en-
gineer. Later he became engineer to the
Tasmanian Aero Club and other com-
panies using Western Junction aerodrome.
Joined Holyman Bros, as chief engineer
when they first started their air service in
the Speck, and when A.N.A. grew out
of the Holyman venture he stayed on in
the same capacity. Stubbs toured the
world for the company in 1938 to study
latest technical developments, and the
efficiency of the A.N.A. airliners is his
responsibility and a tribute to his ability.
“Becks” on two kings—one in, one
out: —•
Plebiscites have this month decided the future
of two Balkan kings—Greece has voted George
II back to an uneasy thrqne and Bulgaria has
added Simeon II to the list of unemployed
monarchs. Neither can claim a very long
history of his dynasty; the Greek royal house
dates from 1863, that of Bulgaria from 1887.
The modern history of both countries begins
with the throwing-off of the Turkish yoke dur-
ing last century. Greece, aided by the Great
Powers, achieved this in 1829, and it was first
planned that the country should be constituted
a principality, tributary to the Sultan. Leopold
of Saxe-Coburg, brother to Victoria’s Prince
Albert, was offered the job of ruler, but
declined. The Powers then raised the country’s
status to that of a kingdom and Otho of
Bavaria was placed on the throne in 1832. He
stuck it for 30 years of alternating despotism
and attempts at popular government, but was
deposed in 1862. A Schleswig-Holstein prince-
ling then became George I. His long reign
saw war with Turkey, interminable disputes
over Macedonia and Crete, the rise of strong
political parties and the Balkan Wars of
1912-13. On his assassination in 1913, his
son Constantine succeeded, but intrigues with
Germany led to his abdication in 1917. The
present King George was passed over and the
throne given to his brother Alexander. When
a fatal bite from a monkey removed Alexander,
Tino came back, but a disastrous war with
Turkey forced a second abdication and George
11. came to the throne in 1922. Deposed two
years later, he was recalled by plebiscite in
1935. When Germany overran Greece in 1941
George moved his court first to Crete, then
to Egypt and finally to Britain, and on the
liberation of his country agreed to postpone
his return till the wishes of his subjects could
be expressed. The vote calls him back.
Possibly Simeon is the more fortunate of the
two monarchs. Simeon is the fourth ruler of
modern Bulgaria. The Treaty of Berlin put
the Hesse prince Alexander of Battenberg on
the throne, but war with Serbia and seizure
of Turkish territory displeased his Russian
sponsors and brought about his abdication in
1886. Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg was given
his throne —still merely a principality under
Turkish overlordship. In 1908 “Foxie” Fer-
dinand proclaimed himself king; in 1912, allied
with Greece and Serbia, he defeated Turkey
in the first Balkan war; then, treacherously
attacking his allies, he was defeated, losing Bul-
garia all she had gained in the war and more
besides. When World War I came he sought
to recover his losses by joining the Central
Powers —another defeat and further loss of
territory resulted. Ferdinand abdicated and
his son Boris succeeded, taking the title of
Boris 111. The earlier Borises were six hun-
dred years back in history, in the pre-Turk
era when Bulgaria was for a time an important
Power; the first Simeon flourished then, too,
also a legendary Krum, who defeated the Em-
peror Nicephorus and used his skull as a
drinking cup. Boris’s reign was not a happy
one. It saw insurrections, attempted assas-
sinations, plots, bombing outrages, political
intrigues, culminating in German pressure and
blackmail. Caught in the Nazi net, and prey-
ing once more on his neighbors, Boris died
mysteriously in 1943 on his return from a visit
to Hitler. Young Simeon, a boy of six, suc-
ceeded, but has never reigned. The best thing
that can be hoped for him is that he never
will.
Melburnians who admire the grey
horses of their police force have nobody
to thank for them more than Senior Con-
stable J, H. Haygarth, just retired from
the charge • of the police stud depot at
Bundoora, near Melbourne. In 1931
Haygarth started breeding the famous
greys whose haunches can be confidently
patted in a street melee by any infant.
He was due to retire in 1944, but Chief
Commissioner Duncan could find no-
body to replace him. An A.I.F. sergeant
farrier in the Kaiser’s war, Haygarth
donned the police uniform in 1920.
After 50 years in the Maoriland civil
service, 30 as Ministerial secretary, G. F.
Dixon goes into retirement. Educated
at Christchurch, he joined the Depart-
ment of Justice in 1896 and finished up
as secretary to the Attorney-General and
Minister of Justice.
“Uco” on a great Liberal:
W. A. Watt, dead in Melbourne at 75,
dropped our of politics in 1929 after more than
30 years in the Victorian and Federal Parlia-
ments. Born at Kyneton (Vic.), he was proud
W. A. WATT,
as Low saw him.
of the fact that he started off in life as a
paperboy Jack Willis, an old-time middle-
weight pug, was one of his mates in the game.
He entered politics by defeating Labor mem-
ber G. M. Prendergast for the North Mel-
bourne seat in the Victorian Assembly, after
going through the debating mill of A.NA.,
which produced so many skilful debaters at
the turn of the century. That was in 1897,
when he was 26. By the time he transferred
to the House of Reps, in 1914 he was Vic-
torian Premier and had held office as State
Treasurer and P.M.G. A Liberal, he was in
opposition till 1917, when Hughes made him
Minister for Works in the first National Gov-
ernment. A forceful speaker with a strong
personality, he was soon recognised as one of
the ablest men in the team, and when Hughes
went abroad on his second trip in 1918 he
became Acting-Prime Minister. As Treasurer
he went to London as Australian delegate to
the 1920 International Conference on Finance.
While away he came into conflict with Hughes
and, never a man to accept dictation or to
compromise on a matter of principle, he re-
signed his portfolios. In the 1923-26 Parlia-
ment the Bruce-Pages made him Speaker ; no
better man has held that office. Watt resigned
his seat Balaclava, since held by Tommy
White —a few months before the general elec-
tions of 1929 and for the remainder of his
life devoted himself to a business career.
Into the silence:
At 72, in Melbourne, Hendry Henderson
Menzies, uncle of the leader of the Federal
Opposition. He was a member of the M.C.C.
and accountant for the wholesale meat firm
of Flemington and W. Reynolds.
In Sydney, at 61, Alexander James McCowan,
principal surveyor for Lloyds in Australia and
Maoriland. Engineering was in his blood—
his father held the same job in Victoria.
At Warrnambool (Vic.), at 62, George
Herbert Ivor Gordon, owner of Ballengeich
West and The Other Side stations and a
grandson of Captain John Eddington, one of
the first settlers in the Western District. He
was a Gallipoli veteran and was awarded the
Croix de Guerre in France. A member of
the V.R.C. he raced a number of well-known
horses.
In Melbourne, T. A. Stewart, past president
of the National Rose Society of Victoria and
a rosarian known all over Australia and in the
United States and Britain. A grower and
writer.
In Melbourne, at 81, Captain Harry Hodgens,
one of Port Phillip’s best-known seamen. With
Huddart, Parker for nearly half a century he
was mate and skipper on tugs and Bay boats,
including Lady Loch, Elingamite, Despatch,
Meeinderry, Coogee, Courier, Hygeia and
Weeroona. Against orders, he risked his life
in 1899 to save a dog which he heard whining
on the Excelsior, sinking after a collision with
the Edina.
In Port Pirie (S.A.), at 61, William Herbert
Threadgold, former M.H.A. for that district,
and Mayor of Port Pirie for 14 years. During
the war he chaired most committees for Pirie’s
many war-time activities, including the A.I.F.
and R.A.A.F. Recruiting Committee, and was
also chairman of the football association.
At Wellington, M.L., J. M. Gillespie,
cousin of Kipling. Served in South Africa and
was afterwards a journalist with the “NX
Times.” After the capture of Samoa in 1914
he became first Commissioner of Police there
and later Resident Commissioner of Savaii.

Women's Letters
From Sydney
The gardens of Admiralty House were
invaded by hundreds of friends and sup-
porters of the Benevolent Society last
Saturday. The day was perfect fete
weather, and from the stalls on the top
lawn to the horse races and the Punch
and Judy on the lawn at the side of the
Governor-General’s residence all things
looked as gala as they were meant to.
The wistaria walk held a haunting and
fragile loveliness, and the cinerarias
turned clean and shining faces to the
day. There was a hoop-la on the lawn in
front of the house, and a spinning jenny.
There were also a pipe band, fish ponds
and travelling lucky dips. The Duke and
Duchess, who returned to their home
from their South Australian tour midway
through the afternoon, found the drive
to the house lined with fete visitors who
had waited from shortly after two to see
the arrival. Eager onlookers at the doings
below during the afternoon were the two
small Princes, who peeped from Jhe bal-
cony.
Sydney concertgoers took farewell of
Georges Thill at the Conservatorium last
Saturday. Once again the beauty of this
singer’s hands was noticed. Probably in
opera Georges’ hands are very expressive
of his emotions. Even in the slight move-
ment permitted by the concert platform
they* still convey a good deal of the
message of the aria. The “Tosca” numbers,
the Andrea Chenier and the “Girl of the
Golden West” arias lent grandeur even to
the sober setting of the Conservatorium.
Rather like a journey in miniature
with Arnold Bennett through his Imperial
Hotel was that taken by the guests to the
Royal Empire Society’s dinner last week.
In honor of shipping knight Thomas
Gordon and his lady, it was held at
Usher’s, and as there is a new lift being
installed in the front of the house, guests
circled through bars, trekked along corri-
dors, past pantries, linen cupboards and
other parts of the engine-room to the
Blue-room.
Here the president of the society,
Colonel Spain, and Mrs. Spain greeted
the guests with smiles, sherry and
savories. Mrs. Spain’s frock was of black
lace, while daughter Mrs. Russell wore
brightly - patterned crepes. Knight
Thomas Gordon looked very bright and
fit after his recent travels. There
were 50 or so at this dinner, which was
given by the council. The traveller’s tale
of his flight from Sydney to London dulls
the glory of the flying-carpet romance of
the fairy tale—a flight that compassed
the ages; Jerusalem, Jericho, Malta and
the invasion beaches of D-Day—from
Botany to Bournemouth in less than
three days. The speaker told his story
with a Caesar-like brevity, but he brought
home the grim necessities of the people
of England: food and more food; fat
and more fat. Start sending it today to
our long-enduring kin.
It’s not only color the artists Inix well
when they get going. You should have
seen the Trocadero on the night of the
Artists’ Ball and the George-street ap*-
proaches to that hall of a thousand de-
lights.* The place was circled with great
posters, all very blithe and gay, by well-
known artists, very hard to place as the
night wore on, because, catching the
spirit of the affair, they whirled merrily,
too. The Troc. was packed with ladies
and gentlemen in bright raiment of all
periods. The eighteen-twenties had in-
spired organiser Mrs. Trevor Wilson, who
had worked hard for the night’s success.
Pale-daffodil and old-rose satins mingled
in her attractive costume.
Stan Cross, who is president of the
Black and White Artists’ Club, helped by
his» wife and daughter entertained a
little group of official guests. Well, this
Artists’ Atomic Ball went off with a
bang, and all who were at it felt pretty
happy, except, maybe, the livestock —
the duck and the chook led in by two
revellers. They probably would rather
have gone to roost. This was the first
artists’ ball since 1939, and there were
over 1500 dancers. “Bambi” Tuckwell,
chosen by Sydney artists as “Model of
1946,” was presented with the first trophy
in what is to be an annual award.
Sad little letter from Moree tells of
drought conditions and birds and animals
so stricken that the wildest of them now
gather close to humans hoping for
succor. The writer describes how, in the
morning when he goes out to crush the
ice in the troughs, the birds come
flying from far and wide and the bush
ponies, usually the shyest of creatures,
come nuzzling Up hoping for a drink.
France’s new Consul-General Henri de
la Croix and his wife arrived in Sydney
last week. They are making their home
at Point Piper. Like the wives of most
Consuls, Mrs. de la Croix has lived in
many parts of the world, but her hus-
band’s appointments have not been in
English-speaking countries, so she does
not speak our tongue. But the French are
so quick that no doubt in a few months’
time she will be quite fluent.
Jean Garside, assistant secretary of
the Crippled Children’s Society of
N.S.W., has a special branch to her work,
and that is vocational guidance —a course
which stretches from youth to about the
age of 25. This training the disabled
child to take his or her place among the
young citizens of the world is a very im-
portant one to Australia. The society is
always alert for ideas that will further
help their young proteges. Recently Miss
Garside did an extensive tour across
America, visiting many great clinics and
seeing methods of training m U.S. The
journey took her right through America
and Canada, and she has brought back
the knowledge she gained to add to the
already great scope of the work in this
country. This photograph of Jean is by.
Norton Trevaire.
What the original Hordern who put
out his sign on Brickfield Hill would
have thought of the swimsuits and beach
wear parading in Anthony Hordern’s art
gallery last week is matter for wonder-
ment. His were the days when women
went clad from heel to ear-lobe. How
the poor things must have hated their
full and flowing garb, their woollen
stockings when temperatures were in the
eighties as they were last week. Perhaps
the trend towards fewer and fewer clothes
is just revolt. There was nothing unduly
challenging, however, in this display of
beach attire. Trigness and color effects
were the strong points.
The long and swirling hostess frocks,
and evening frocks which showed the
slashed skirt, side drapings and bustle
bows were gazed upon with fascinated
gaze by a “crowded house.” There was
a demure grey-aftemoon number that
made instant appeal. This was one of
several American models. Making
running and expert commentary on the
display was Patricia Roberts. She is a
Melburnian who has lived for eight or
nine years in New York, and has ac-
quired an American accent plus an inti-
mate knowledge of cosmetics and beauty
care. Her advice included “teen-olds”
and the “older girl,” the older girl being
her listeners from 30 onwards. After
hearing Mrs. Roberts one of her audience
was all set for conferring on her an M.A.
degree.
Still another of the “Little” theatres
which time has proved are of such value
in fostering the love of drama has been
formed in Sydney. The north side of the
harbor has been well looked after with
the Independents, the Guild Groups and
the just - beginning Australian Play-
wrights’ Theatre. Now it is the turn of
King’s Cross to be the home of a move-
ment known as the Australian Arts Move-
ment. This group has been promised
premises which it hopes to turn into a
permanent theatre, where, in addition to
plays by professional and amateur casts,
music, dancing and art exhibitions will
be presented. Ross Buchanan is the
A.A.M.’s director of drama, and he will
produce “The Importance of Being
Earnest” at the Conservatorium to-
morrow evening at 8.15.
Tomorrow evening between six and
nine o’clock the president and council
of the Royal Art Society will welcome a
host of friends at the Education Depart-
ment’s Gallery. This is a festive pro-
logue to the R.A.S. annual show, which
will be presented officially on Saturday
at three o’clock by Education Minister
Heffron.
From Melbourne
Youth graced the ballroom of Govern-
ment House when Lieut.-Governor Sir
Edmund Herring, and Lady Herring
gave an informal dance for the school
and universitv friends of their daughters
ana university menus or tneir aaugmers.
The drawing-rooms were decorated with
bowls of beautiful spring flowers, Ice-
land poppies and arum lilies (all from the
garden of G.H.), while the buffet supper-
tables were set with bowls of purple iris,
white heath and white and pink blossom.
Sir Edmund and Lady Herring, with
members of their suite, joined in the
dancing; Lady Herring wore a soft black
net frock with the deep waistband orna-
mented with gold leaves. Her eldest
daughter wore a slimly cut gown of mid-
night-blue and silver brocade. Her sister
Judith, who was with her fiance Nicholas
Turnbull, chose azure-blue taffeta.
In the official party was Mrs. H. B.
Sewell, who will go to Brisbane with
Lady Lavarack, the wife of Queensland’s
new Governor, as personal secretary—
she chose a turquoise-blue crepe frock
with pearls embroidered on the short
sleeves. Joan Cain, daughter of the
Premier, wore a three-tiered skirt of
creamy net, and allied it with a tight-
fitting bodice of black velvet. Peggy
Mollard’s frock of heavy ivory satin had
diamente shoulder ‘straps. Victoria Doug-
las, niece of Admiral Sir Louis Hamilton,
was a dainty figure in soft pastel blue
with ribbon and net worked into the
skirt. Most of the frocks were fashioned
on formal lines, and the off-the-shoulder
treatment was chosen by many. So, also,
was the deep lace bertha, which trimmed
many of the gowns of shimmering
taffetas. Valerie Bodycomb wore velvet
gloves in the same toning as her deep-
cyclamen gown. Margaret, daughter of
Archbishop and Mrs. Booth, was another
who chose cyclamen ; hers was of
georgette with a very full skirt. Vivienne
Lee’s taffeta gown of floral fuchsia had a
deep hem of white net. Rosemary Knox’s
was a black, coin-spotted bouffant frock
of net.
Peggy Indor, who has been doing radio
work for the past five years, is the pos-
sessor of a lovely mezzo-soprano voice.
Three months ago she joined the Ex-
servicemen’s Revue Company as guest
artist. She has also been helping to create
and sew the 120 costumes which will be
worn in the revue which opens at the
Melbourne Repertory Theatre on Sep-
tember 28. All the music and songs have
been written by ex-servicemen. Peggy
is social secretary of the company, which
is a co-operative one. Photo, by "An-
toine-Kershaw.
Children’s Hospital funds will be
greatly increased by the Orchid Show
now being held in the Melbourne Town
Hall. The finest orchids ever seen in this
city are on show, and the whole collec-
tion is valued at many thousands of
pounds. Their colors range from purest
white to deep glowing red, and a section
has been devoted to Australian native
orchids. Books on the growing of these
exotic plants for beginners are on sale
at the show.
Over one thousand dancers crowded
St. Kilda Town Hall for the Air Force
Association Ball. A fighter ’plane flying
from a world in flames towards a dove
of peace, a model of the proposed Air
Force Memorial building and emblems
of the R.A.F., R.A.A.F. and R.N.Z.A.F.,
with ribbons leading to a series of sig-
nals denoting the work of the association,
were the theme of the decorations.
Federal president of the Association, Air-
Marshal R. Williams, was in the official
party, and members of the R.A.F. Lan-
caster Aries’ crew, headed by Air-Com-
modore D’Aeth, C.8.E., were honored
guests. Former Group-Captain Bert
Chadwick was there with his wife \ she
in a gown of aqua-blue crepe. Mrs.
Lukis, who wore black crepe, came with
her air - commodore husband. Mrs.
Lachal, wife of Air-Commodore L,
Lachal, was another who favored crepes
•m- _ y .
—hers were of powder blue sprinkled
with silver sequins. Margaret Linehan
matched her frock with a wreath of silk
flowers, ending in a trail at one shoulder.
Louise Lovely, in cherry-red georgette
and white ermine bolero, had a success-
ful evening disposing of the gifts at her
stall in the foyer.
Under the patronage of Lieut.-Gover-
nor Sir Edmund Herring, the New Guinea
Women’s Association is sponsoring a
Scholarship Fund, as a memorial to the
men of New Guinea who lost their lives
through enemy action. The scholarship
is open to boys and girls, and to raise
funds for it the N.G.W.A. is holding a
cabaret ball at the St. Kilda Town Hall
on Friday, October 11. The women of
the committee (Mesdames Clare Cooper
and Stanley Best are the ticket secretaries)
plan to reproduce an attractive tropical
atmosphere which they confidently ex-
pect will make the Bird of Paradise Ball
the outstanding event of the spring racing
carnival. On Tuesday, September 24, the
box plan for the ball opens in the lounge
of the Tourist Bureau in Collins-street.
Helen Eyles, secretary of the Inter-
national Club of Victoria, advises that
the club’s first ball and festival since
1940 will be held at St. Kilda Town Hall
on September 23. Representatives of
many nations will take part in the Grand
March in costume, and individual
national dances will also be performed.
Among the countries so far to be repre-
sented will be Scotland, Wales, India,
Denmark, Chile, Poland and China. Mrs.
Herbert Brookes is the club’s president.
The Right Revy David McKie, Bishop
of Geelong, was seen in a pew role when
he opened Douglas Watson’s exhibition
of paintings at George’’s Gallery. His
Grace humorously referred to the
“mutual agreement with my artist friends
that they don’t talk at my services and
I don’t paint at their exhibitions,” and
seriously deplored that more people didn’t
occupy their leisure hours painting for
pleasure. Also giving support to the
artist was Alan Moore, whose wife was
attractive in a powder-blue crepe blouse
and navy skirt. Mrs. Douglas Stephens’s
skyscraper hat was worn with a smart
black suit. With Mrs. Redvers Bate was
daughter Manon; Sydney visitor, Mrs.
Keith Harris, was accompanied by Mrs.
R. H. Cunningham, up from Frankston
for the exhibition.
For her Town Hall concert Joan Ham-
mond qhose a long-sleeved gown of soft
suede silk patterned in a floral design of
blue, rose and soft greens—a creation
that enhanced the charm of a singer who
has delighted Melbourne with the refine-
ment of her art. Dressing of the audi-
ence mostly ran to dressmaker suits and
printed silks worn under tailored coats.
Against a backdrop of blue skies,
golden sands and rippling water, beach-
wear fashions will prove gay and excit-
ing this summer. A recent fashion parade
featured butcher-blue “pedal-pushers”
(well-tailored narrow slacks a little
longer than knee length), worn with a
scarlet skirt and mandarin jacket made
in butcher-blue linen and frogged with
scarlet. Colorful and exhilarating was
another “pedal pusher” of coral-pink,
worn with a white shirt and a fisherboy
cap in the same coral. A scarlet “cholo”
coat, finger-tip length and belted, was
worn over a white shark’s-skin bloomer
set consisting of brief shorts, gathered in
above the knees and a strapless brassiere
top. Another breathtaking set featured
full white bloomers and a red and white
brassiere top ; red on one side and twisted
to meet the other side of white material.
Many of the brassiere tops on sun-suits
and swimsuits are strapless, and have
better figure control and flatter finish
than the styles of last season. Taffeta
and slub rayon and striped seersucker
form the bulk of the materials.

How to Simplify
Property Management
New and ever-varying forms of
taxation; changes in the values
of investments ; war-time restric-
tions and amendments in legis-
lation —
All these throw greatly added responsi-
bilities upon people'having the handling
of estates.
For the well-informed man of affairs
property-management is difficult
enough, but for those without know-
ledge or experience the problem is
frightening.
Your own observation teaches you that
relatively few women possess this
managerial experience. Their training
is naturally in other spheres—and you,
as a good provider, have relieved them
of the worry and responsibility.
But when in due course you are no
longer there to manage—what then?
Don’t let your love for those dependent
on you blind you to the realities of life.
Safeguard your dependents by drawing
on the knowledge and experience of
those trained over many years I for this
very work, and arrange for the Union
Trustee Company to take over your

Iron and steel are vital to Australia’s
economic recovery and wellbeing. Inter-
fere with their production and, among
other things, you interrupt supply of a
wide range of products everywhere in
demand along the complicated route
from raw materials to the consumer.
Demand for the co.’s products is excep-
tionally heavy to-day, both for com-
mercial purposes and as raw materials
for subsidiary and associated cos. Yet,
owing to shortage of coal and industrial
hold-ups, the big Newcastle steelworks,
capable of turning out a million tons
of steel ingots annually, is operating at
only 66 p.c. capacity.
In big integrated works, where the
processes of conversion from ore to steel
and other products follow each other
consecutively, continuous output at or
near capacity is essential, if consumers,
workers and owners are to reap the full
benefits of efficient production and
efficient production means a high level
of employment at high wages combined
with relatively low selling prices to the
consumer.
As for coal, strikes and absenteeism
resulted in a production loss of 330,000
tons from the co.’s own pits, portion of
the reduced output was impressed for
other users, and part of the co.’s con-
tract supplies from outside collieries suf-
fered a similar fate. Chairman H. C.
Darling says:
This untenable position is directly attri-
butable to industrial instability and lack
of discipline within the coalmining industry
itself, and until this problem is' solved
neither the steel industry nor any other
industry dependent on coal can give of its
best, and the community will continue to
suffer shortages in goods and dislocation
of services.
Operations at the steelworks had to be
curtailed. This led to a labor dispute,
involving the co.’s right to say who
should go and who should remain, which
resulted in complete cessation of steel
production for nine weeks.
On the shipping side, strikes and short-
age of wharf labor have added one-third
to the time taken pre-war to complete
the round-trip—outward with products
from Newcastle and return with iron-ore
from Whyalla. This despite installation
of mechanical handling equipment at the
co.’s wharves at each end.
Operations at Iron Knob, the big ore
deposits on Eyre Peninsula, were gov-
erned largely by the shipping position.
At Whyalla, the port from which the
ore is shipped, the blast furnace started
up again in March last, after 22 months’
idleness owing to coke shortage. Its con-
tinued operation will depend upon im-
proved coal supplies.
At the Whyalla shipbuilding yards
three vessels were completed and handed
over to the Shipping Board, and two
more, recently launched,’ are now being
fitted out. Work on hand includes four
6000-ton vessels for the Government,
and four 12,500-tonners for the co.’s
own trade. Before long this trade will
include haulage of ore from Cockatoo
Island, Yampi Sound, where over a mil-
lion pounds is being spent on plant and
development. If shipbuilding in Australia
is to survive on an economic basis costs
will have to be reduced.
The position at Port Kembla, where
A.I. and S. operates, is similar to that
at Newcastle. Shortage of labor and
materials continues to delay completion
of the new coke ovens, but construction
of the combination rod, bar and strip
mill is going ahead. A notable achieve-
ment has been manufacture, for the first
time in Australia, of grooved tramway
rails. On May 30 last A.I. and S., in
which B.H.P. holds all the £4,700,000 of
ord. capital, paid its first ord. div (5
p.c.) since the co. took over the Hoskins
Lithgow works and transferred them to
Kembla about 18 years ago.
Output of other subsidiaries is reported
satisfactory, though a 22-weeks’ stoppage
at Lysaghts interrupted production there.
Plant for fabricating fence posts is now
being erected in Maoriland. Tubemakers
of Australia, Ltd. (paid capital
£2,037,502) was recently formed to weld
the interests of Stewarts and Lloyds
(Aus.) Pty. and Tube Mills (Aus.) Pty.,
in both of which B.H.P. was interested.
Figures in the introductory table relate
to B.H.P.’s accounts only, which show
a small increase in profit, owing to a
bigger return from investments, due
mainly to the A.I. and S. div. already re-
ferred to. Actually, there was a sharp
contraction of £254,723 in net earnings
of the group;

The drop of £867,829 in profit on work-
ing account was partly offset by a
growth of £54,981 in receipts from out-
side investments and by a saving of
£558,125 in allowances for depreciation,
taxation, etc. The £775,543 of profit was
an inadequate 3.2 p.c. on shareholders’
funds. It covers both group and outside
interests. On group interests alone 5 p.c,
on capital calls for 3.1 p.c. on share-
holders’ funds. So, after paying the
moderate div., there was little to spare
last term.
As for the outlook, trade prospects are
buoyant, and, given adequate supplies of
coal and reasonable freedom from in-
dustrial hold-ups, a substantial increase
in sales can be looked for, and unit costs
should benefit. Still, the trend of costs
is upward, and the co.’s selling prices are
fixed by official edict. So on the share-
market, which is subject to a wide range
of psychological as well as economic in-
fluences, the price of the pound shares
recently eased from the ceiling figure of
48s. 9d. to 445. 6d. Last week they
fetched 455. 6d., at which figure the re-
turn is 2.2 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis.
The investor at 455. 6d. who looks for
4.4 p.c. on his money counts on a 10 p.c.
div., which ought to be within reach
when conditions become more settled.

An astonishing performance. While most
other hotels show a recession in net earn-
ing over the last 12 months the Metropole
records an increase of £3986, The
£35,657 of profit claimed was the best
since Sydney interests took over for Mel-
bourne owners early this century. It was
written after allowing £34,000 for taxa-
tion, £2OOO for depreciation and £4OOO
for deferred renewals (same in all cases as
for previous term), and was an attractive
14.1 p.c. on capital as against 12.5, 11.6,
11.6, 6.3, 7.4 and 8.6 p.c. back to 1940.
The div. was lifted from 10 p.c. to 11£
p.c., which is also the best in the co.’s
history.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the
pound shares, covered by 265. 6d. in net
tangibles, are jammed at the ceiling price
of 355. 6d. on the market, with sellers
remaining in their shells. The return at
355. 6d. would be 6.5 p.c. on an \\\ p.c.
div. basis, or 5.6 p.c. on a 10 p.c. distri-
bution.
The year marked the beginning of the
transition period, and saw an efflux of
U.S. and British service personnel, partly
offset by demobilisation of our own
forces. The deferred pay of service per-
sonnel and continued high level of em-
ployment meant that there was plenty of
of money about. And more wine and
spirits became available as the year
advanced. Beer rationing ceased in
March last, but owing to shortage of raw
materials (barley and hops) the breweries
continue to adhere to the official quota
until their output can be stepped up,
which ought to be possible by the time the
thirsty summer months arrive.
Apparently it was the bar and lounge
trade that put the kick into the figures.
The percentage of guest occupancy re-
mained abnormally high, but the catering
service, which is being supplied at below
its cost to the co., again resulted in a
loss, and wages and costs generally “in-
creased to a considerable extent.” The
immediate outlook, brightened by pros-
pects of a bigger wool cheque, favors
maintenance of a high level of earnings.
But costs remain on the up-grade, with
no signs of a recession, and when the
present spate of spending has ended earn-
ings might be expected to ease a little.
The question of tax relief will depend
upon election results.
When materials and labor become avail-
able, renovations and renewals will call
for considerable outlay, to meet which
a substantial holding of cash, etc., has
been accumulated:

Profits in the table are those shown in
the published accounts. The improve-
ment last term was better than these
figures suggest. Actually it amounted to
£9611, the difference arising from an
alteration in the method of treating tax-
ation. Hitherto each year’s earnings had
been charged with the previous year’s in-
come tax, no specific provision being
made to meet the next bill when it
arrived. Last term £39,500 was set aside
out of the year’s earnings to meet tax-
ation thereon; the previous year’s bill
(£22,258, up £7945) being charged against
reserves.
The year’s gross earnings shot up
£88,511, reaching £199,552, which was
£80,317 above the 1939 figure. The
£39,806 of profit claimed was the best
showing since 1927, being a juicy 28.6
p.c. on capital. A “victory” div. of 8
p.c. was out with the ordinary 8 p.c.
distribution, making 16 p.c. for the year,
which was a comfortable matter. The
£17,552 that remained lifted reserves to
£196,580, which was £57,487 in excess of
paid capital. So shareholders’ funds
(capital and reserves combined) need turn
in only 3.3 p.c. to show 8 p.c. on capital
alone. Allowing for tax adjustments,
average net earnings for the six difficult
war-years to the close of accounts in 1945
were £16,803, or 12 p.c. on capital.
Earnings come from Morris and Stude-
baker franchises for Queensland and the
Northern Rivers of N. S. Wales, assisted
by what looks like a remunerative sub-
agency for International trucks (acquired
in 1943), and agencies for Electricc re-
frigeration and Philco radio, as well as a
wad of outside investments—Government
securities and industrials. A year hgo

Doctors say your kidneys contain 15
miles of tiny tubes or filters which
help to purify the blood and keep
you healthy. When they get tired
and don't work right in the daytime,
many people have disturbed nights.
Frequent or poor kidney action some-
times shows there is something wrong
with your kidneys or bladder. Don't
neglect this condition and lose valu-

When disorder of kidney function
permits poisonous matter to remain

aches, and dizziness.
Don't delay. Ask your chemist or

the board reported that arrangements
were well advanced for further develop-
ment and sale of refrigerators and
“other domestic appliances,” many of
which had not previously been marketed
by the co. Delivery of new cars in the
Australian market is behind schedule,
because of production and other diffi-
culties, including priorities, in countries
of origin. New Morris and Studebaker
vehicles are now arriving, but their ap-
pearance on the market is being delayed
by local industrial trouble and material
shortages, the board says. To what extent
the steep rise in prices (50 p.c. and more
above pre-war figures) is likely to affect
new car sales remains to be seen.

and otherwise, to meet competition:

extra £17,688. The year’s improvement
in the more or less liquid surplus
(£329,022) amounted to £48,930.
For the pound shares, covered by
48s. 3d. in net tangibles, buyers offer 335.
(ceiling price) without attracting sellers.
The return at 335. would be 4.8 p.c. on an
8 p.c. div. basis, with prospects.
Victoria is stepping up its gold pro-
duction. Output for the State in 1945
was 61,790 fine oz. (up 77040 z.). For
the first half of 1946 the figure was
36,897 fine oz., an increase of 10,09 loz.
compared with the corresponding half of
1945. The 1945 output was valued at
£661,425; dividends paid amounted to
£223,125, compared with £229,875 in
1944. Principal producers in 1945 were:
* Fine oz.

Morning Star (Woods Point) .. 13,255
North Deborah (Bendigo) .. .. 6,973

Wattle Gully (Chewton) . . .. 5,545
Maude and Yellow Girl (Glen
Willis) 3,481
Deborah (Bendigo) 1,889
There is a marked revival of activity on
the Bendigo field, which, with the ex-
ception of Ballarat, has produced more
gold than any other field in the State,
having an unbroken record as a pro-
ducer from 1851. A year or so ago only
four mines here (on the Deborah line)
were producing. Now work is proceed-
ing at 18 or more mines, and others are
scheduled to resume at an early date.
A feature of the present revival is the
continuance of shaft-sinking to test the
possibilities of the field at greater depth.
It is mainly for this purpose that a num-
ber of cos are now asking shareholders
for more. The field consists of a series
of anticlinal and synclinal folds, more
than 20 anticlines having been mapped
in a width of three miles. Saddle reefs
occur in depths at irregular intervals.

For the year to end March last, Morn-

The bulk of the ore last term came
from the Achilles floor, the remainder
from development on the Exeter and
Stirling floors. Average head value was
o.4dwt. better at 18.2dwt.; there was little
change in recovery (92.9 p.c.), leaving
I.3dwt. in the residues. The lift in out-
put was mainly responsible for the drop
of 2s. 6d. a ton in costs. Combined
effect, together with a slightly better aver-
age price for gold, was a lift of £13,842
in net earnings’ which were equal to
3s. 7d. per 4s. share. The div. was kept
at 2s. per share, making total distributions

per share. Ore reserves are put at 31,000
tons, averaging 12dwt. A drive on the
Exeter floor has exposed 100 ft. of
17.7dwt. ore over a width of 32 inches.
Preparations for shaft-sinking have be-
gun for the purpose of opening up Nos.
17, 18 and 19 levels on the Stirling and
Lancaster floors. Diamond-drilling on
Working Miners’ lease has so far been
disappointing, the board proposes to re-
examine the All Nations and Loch Fyne
mines. When the books closed there was
£85,523 in cash. Government securities,
book debts, etc., to meet £2068 coming
to outsiders. There are 400,000 4s. shares,
which the market prices at 15s. 3d. each.
* * * *
Lake View and Star throughput, which
continues to increase, is nearing the pre-
war peak. For the four weeks to August
20, 11,0950 z. of fine gold was extracted
from 46,236 tons -of ore and some resi-
dues. Ore reserves are practically un-
changed at around the four million tons
mark, and are tipped, when development
is stepped up, to get further ahead of the
mill. The London yarn about an early-
doubling of dividends is disbelieved
locally. Co. is said to have abandoned
its share of the option on the Porphyry
Gold Mine, near Edjudina. The other
two option holders, Wiluna and Gold
Fields Development, have not yet an-
nounced their intentions.
*** * *
Goldmining options recently taken
in Westralia include one by Adelaide
Mines Development, N.L., on the old Ives
Reward group, near Widgiemooltha, on
the north-eastern end of the Coolgardie
field. This group was pegged about 25
years ago by a then well-known and since
deceased prospector, Phil Ives, who sold
it to a cq. The Reward was boomed as
the makings of a big gold producer, but
returns from crushings were far below ex-
pectations, and the undertaker got a job.
Ah option has also been secured on
Evanston North by a local co. with a
nominal capital of £lO,OOO and an itch.
• This show is one of several blocks form-
ing part of the wilderness around the
Evanston mine, on the North Yilgarn
field. Evanston directors claim to have
80,000 tons of “readily accessible” ore in
sight.
* ♦ * •
Paringa, operating on the Kalgoorlie
Golden Mile (W.A.), reports an encour-
aging development. The drill has cut an
ore shoot on the co.’s western boundary,
and four feet of the core assayed
18.8dwt. The hole, which went out from
the 962 ft. level of the North Kalgoorlie
shaft, confirms Paringa’s No. 65 bore-
hole, which disclosed 9dwt. to 17dwt. ore
at a vertical depth of 920 ft. Indications
are that the ore shoot is on and about
the boundary of the two properties,
occurring at some stages in both holdings.

SUNDRY SHOWS
MELBOURNE MUSIC.
There are no signs of any diminution
in the flood of music being poured out
on three fronts in Melbourne. One of
the most notable festivals in the city’s
history came to an end when Professor
Heinze laid down his baton at the finish
of the fourth Bach-Handel programme in
St. Paul’s Cathedral,
Instruments like the harpsichord, the
organ, the flute and the piano and the voice
of Thea Phillips sounded, somehow, very
different from what they sound like in
the rectangular spaces of the Town Hall.
Possibly music bounces back from flat
walls but wanders gracefully around the
groins and arches of Gothic churches.
Audiences kept their seats for several
minutes after each performance, and the
last notes of a concerto weren’t lost in
the trampling of feet making for the
exits, as happens in concert chambers.
That Joan Hammond is probably one
of the most serious artists ever to appear
on the Australian platform was shown on
her return to the Melbourne Town Hall.
She once more sang her way through a
programme of exacting songs, nine-tenths
of which must have been unfamiliar even
to the most confirmed concertgoer. Most
of the songs were either French or Ger-
man, and of the same character and
within much the same range of feeling.
The differences between them were very
subtle, and to an unpractised ear they
would tend to sound monotonous —but
so would the works of an accomplished
painter to an unpractised eye. Miss Ham-
mond made none of the conventional
concessions.
•• f *
With Margaret Schofield as associate
artist, Edmund Kurtz gave another of his
’cello recitals at the Assembly Hall. Kurtz
is one of the world’s greatest ’cellists
and his instrument is one of the only 17
Stradivariuses of its kind in existence.
The Russian musician introduced a new
sonata by Shostakovitch to Melbourne.
It was as melodiously gentle and tradi-
tional as they make ’em.
Julius Ujhelyi, a Hungarian violinist,
occupied the same hall for one night. He
was adept and graceful in a Mozart
rondo, a Chopin ballad and some modern
pieces.
Thill and Joseph Post.
When he appeared with the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra under Joseph Post
at the Conservatorium Georges Thill
opened the “Flower Song” from “Car-
men” with a note even flatter than a
Chifley speech. Throughout this aria
and another from Halevy’s “La Juive” the
singing was sluggish with any note above
F an apparent strain. Later, in excerpts
from “Parsifal” and “Tannhauser,” M.
Thill was much mbre at home, although
at no time did he infuse any fire into his
singing. Mr. Post, in these scenes, and
also in the Venusburg music from “Tann-
hauser,” handled the orchestra capably.
He put his best work into earlier readings
of works by Respighi and Dvorak, evok-
ing a fine response from an orchestra that
has improved out of sight in the past
six months. John Cameron, who sang
Wolfram’s part, has a voice of quality
and resonance, though scarcely sufficient
power to cope with a Wagnerian score.
* * * *
The mysticism of Beethoven’s Sonata
in C Major (the “Waldstein”); its
lilt and gaiety and passionate urgency
were well brought out by Daphne Harpur
at her Sydney Conservatorium recital last
week —her finest playing of the evening
was in the lovely Adagio movement.
Three Intermezzi by Brahms, a Chopin
group, and Rummel’s arrangement of an
extract from a Bach Cantata constituted
the balance of Miss Harpur’s homage to
the beautiful in musical literature. Pro-
kofiev’s Sonata No. 3, with its accent on
dissonance, its straining after rhythmic
effects and the sardonic bitterness that
winds through it, seemed mainly an ex-
position of musical athletics —and even
here the pianist was never at a loss.
"Acacia Avenue."
English playwrights seem particularly
adept at portraying what is called middle-
class or lower-middle-class suburbia—
Noel Coward did it magnificently in
“This Happy Breed.” Somehow, however,
a note of depression persists in their
plays, even when they are labelled
comedies and cause continuous ripples of
laughter. Which was the case with the
“Acacia Avenue” of Denis and Mabel
Constanduros, put on by Melbourne’s
Little Theatre ; even though it is equipped
with a “happy ending.”
The parents of the Acacia Avenue
family have decided to take their first
holiday with their family for 30 years
and plan a pleasure cruise in the Medi-
terranean. On the- eve of their departure
it transpires that the son of the house
doesn’t want to go, having fallen to the
wiles of a flash young lady. The
daughter won’t go because she has got her-
self engaged to a young man and doesn’t
want the courtship business interrupted.
Finally the simple maid-of-all-work has
come under the spell of a coarse young
man with no strong moral scruples.
The father and mother feel as if they
were leaving their home just before the
explosion of a time bomb, so they
secretly countermand their trip and go to
near-by Bognor. They return unexpectedly
to find that their son has been deserted
by the flash young woman after she has
spent all his money; that their daughter
and her fiance are living under the
ancestral rooftree, and that their fore-
taste of marriage has already produced
the usual clashes, frustration and a bitter
quarrel. Everything is cleared up at the
final curtain.
Probably because these situations are
not far outside their experience, amateurs
can generally feel and identify themselves
with them and thus do their stuff far
better than professional actors who are
trained to be versatile and play roles they
can’t feel. Dorothy O’Keefe had all the
feelings of a bewildered mother and Brett
Randall really felt for the lettuces to
which he escapes from every awkward
situation. The conflict between beliefs
and feelings of young couples pledged to
the quaint modern theory of companion-
ate or trial marriage was admirably con-
veyed by Brian James and Honor Daly.
Jean Watson as the hypnotised maid-of-
all-work was as good as any.
Artbursts.
The watercolors of Ewen J. French at
Myer’s Gallery, Melbourne, are set in a
low key which gives some of them an
attenuated appearance. A little of
Nature’s harshness would improve them.
That doesn’t apply where the subject
suits the painter, as in “The Waterhole”
and “Boats, Rye,” and in the vistas of
bush and plain where the light is soft and
filmy. S. Antonini depicts an entirely
different world in oils at Kozminsky’s.
There is as much harshness in one of his
studies of daffodils or camellias as Mr.
French gets into a wailful of landscapes.
The portrait of a musician in a brown
jacket is a good factual likeness.
* * * *
The silk screen prints by Alan Sumner,
at the Margaret Jaye Gallery, Sydney,
are handmade and it is claimed that they
are produced by a method new in Aus-
tralia. Whether they can be fairly re-
garded as works of art is an open ques-
tion depending largely on the interpreta-
tion given that overworked expression.
At any rate they are pleasing. Twenty-
four prints are on show, all in limited
editions ranging from 36 to eight. Apart
from a pleasant liveliness, occasional
flashes of observation and odd splashes
of color which redeem the pictures from
mediocrity to quaintness, there is nothing
in the collection to set the Tank Stream
afire. Still, it is something to have
achieved quaintness.
"A Place of One's Own."
After a lifetime of reviewing and trans-
lating Ibsen, William Archer, the Eng-
lish critic, decided to write a play, “The
Green Goddess,” and to everybody’s sur-
prise, including his own, produced one
of the most successful melodramas ever
written. ~
Osbert Sitwell seems to have done
much the same thing in “A Place of
One’s Own” (Melbourne Athenaeum), the
ingredients of which are a 40-year-old
murder and a ghost who plays a piano
at which a live girl is sitting. Sitwell’s
wit and flair for minor characterisation
fail to conceal the fact that his opus is
basically melodrama and that the most
original thing about it is that neither the
ghost nor the murder makes a positive
appearance. They are both in the mind
of Margaret Lockwood, who comes as
lady help to a house rumored to be
haunted.
Miss Lockwood falls neurotically ill
when she finds that her ability to strum
at the piano has turned into the skill of
a finished virtuoso. She is cured —un-
convincingly—by a doctor who appears
at her bedside after he had been found
dead in a railway carriage on the previ-
ous evening.
Sitwell set out to prove that spirits
can live on in old houses; he has cer-
tainly proved that he can write melo-
drama.

“The Captive Heart” (Embassy):
Quietly told story of p.-0.-w. camp in
Germany, Michael Redgrave is the
refugee Czech professor who assumes the
identity of a dead British officer to save
himself from the Gestapo, and, to main-
tain the subterfuge, is forced to corre-
spond with and deceive the dead man’s
wife (Rachel Kempson). Basil Rad-
ford, Mervyn Johns and Jack Warner
lead a remarkably good cast.
“Leave Her to Heaven” (Regent):
Purports to be a study of an insanely
jealous woman who murders her brother-
in-law and, in a fit of pre-natal madness,
her unborn child, and finally makes her
own suicide look like murder by her
half-sister —all that because she wants
her husband completely to herself. Gene
Tierney barely scrambles from histrionic
peak to peak, while Cornel Wilde, as the
husband, stands wonderingly by.
“Lady Luck” (Plaza): Light comedy
about an inveterate gambler reformed
by marriage to a popsy who finally gives
way to the gambler’s streak deeply im-
planted in her own family. Robert
Young and Barbara Hale are amusing,
but Frank Morgan and James Gleason
provide most of the comedy.
“The Runaround” (Victory): Mildly
amusing story of a private sleuth detailed
to prevent an heiress from eloping with
a sailor and to bring her safely home
again. Rod Cameron, as the sleuth,
vaguely resembles a rough granite carv-
ing and displays slightly more animation;
Ella Raines is the wench.
“Murder in the Music Hall” (Lyceum):
The victim is knifed, the corpse dis-
covered and the murderer bagged, all be-
tween scenes of a lavish ballet on ice.
Vera Ralston manages her skating
routines with considerably more grace
and confidence than she handles the rest
of her role; William Gargan is the un-
worried sleuth,


AUSTRALIAN WOOL REALIZATION COMMISSION
NOTICE TO EXPORTERS OF WOOL
The Commonwealth Government has directed that the prohibition
on the export of wool unless the export be ■with the permission of the Minister
for Trade and Customs is to continue, and the prohibition is to be admin*
istered by the Department of Trade and Customs in collaboration with the
Australian Wool Realization Commission.
The following procedure will apply to shorn wool (greasy or scoured)
and wool derived from sheepskins, but it will n'ot apply to wool consigned
by a grower for sale by auction in the United Kingdom; to wool on the skin,
to manufactured wool, including wool tops, wool noils, or manufacturers
wool waste.
1. Collectors of Customs will not permit the export of SHORN WOOL
OR WOOL DERIVED FROM SHEEPSKINS (not being wool consigned
by a grower for sale by auction in the United Kingdom) unless the
exporter produces a certificate from the Commission to say that he
is an exporter approved by the Commission.
2. A Certificate of Approval will be granted by the Commission
only on the condition that the exporter does not export any
shorn wool, whether greasy or scoured (not being wool
consigned by a grower for sale by auction in the United
Kingdom), which has not been purchased at an auction
approved by the Commission.
3. The Certificate should be presented by the exporter to the Collector
of Customs in the State concerned, who will retain it and record the
exporter as an exporter of wool approved by the Commission in terms
of the Certificate.
4. A duplicate of the Certificate will be supplied for the exporter’s own
records. .
5. The Commission’s approval of an exporter will be withdrawn should
that exporter export or attempt to export shorn wool not purchased
at an auction approved by the Commission.
6. Wool appraised under the National Security Wool Regulations which
has not since been purchased by public auction will not be covered
by the Certificate and, as at present, the Collector of Customs will
require the endorsement of the Australian Wool Realization Commis-
sion (State Office) on applications for licences to export such
appraised wools. .
7. The serial number of the Certificate must appear on all applications
for licences to export shorn wool which has been purchased at
auction or wool derived from sheepskins, but not on applications for
licences to export wool which is not covered by the Certificate.
Exporters who wish to export shorn wools or wool derived from sheep-
skins under the conditions determined by the Government and who have
not received a certificate of approval as an exporter from the Australian
Wool Realization Commission should make application to the Commission
repackers and country buyers who desire to buy
direct from growers may do so, but before the export of the wool so pur-
chased will be possible it will be necessary to submit that
in Australia in the normal way. Persons desiring to fulfil orders received
from overseas clients will have full opportunity to purchase their require-
wish to continue their prewar practice of consigning
,00l to their brokers in the United Kingdom for sale by auction there may
lo so without application to the Commission for an approval to export,
,ut under the Contributory Charge legislation such growers must complete
in approved arrangement with the Commissioner of Taxation for purposed of
nsuring the collection of the correct amount of Contributory Charge.

SP ORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
In a fall in the first race at Randwick on
Saturday J. Duncan, one of the very best
lightweight jockeys in the land, and a par-
licularly good rider over distances, was fatally
injured. Duncan was riding the Novice (first
division) favorite Lord Dundee. Near the
half-mile Lord Dundee, well up in the field,
stumbled and fell, throwing Duncan against
the running rail. D. Munro, on Double Mint,
also came down, but escaped injury. It was
Munro’s second fall in a year. Duncan’s last
important win was the Doncaster on Blue
Legend.
For the Novice 124 originally nominated
and over 50 accepted, first division winner
turning up in Kuvera Hope (H. McCloud),
followed home by Waricia and Ozonian. First
and second, both rough ’uns, were bracketed
on the tote, so that a place ticket on the
bracket t paid a particularly good dividend—
£s os. 6d., compared with a win dividend of
£lO 11s., which Waricia’s win backers also
collected. The Actor colt P r P ctor scored a
good win in the second division, accounting
for Cherokee Lad and Doughnut.
The nine-furlongs w.f.a. Chelmsford Stakes
gave Bernborough his twelfth in a row and
one of his easiest wins to date. A. Mulley
rushed Bernborough to the lead seven furlongs
from home, when Magnificent and Prince
Consort, out in front, were slowing the field
to a canter and trying to make it a battle of
“tactics.” That was the end of the tactics.
Nothing thereafter looked like troubling Em-
borough’s great son, and over the last half
furlong, with a few mighty bounds, he drew
five lengths clear. In view of what finished
behind them, rather than what beat them,
the three-year-olds Two Grand and Prince Con-
sort did well in filling the minor places.
Commonly regarded as a useful guide to
Epsom prospects, the seven-furlongs Tramway
Handicap attracted a first-rate field of sprinters.
The betting was open, but from barrier-rise
there was only one in it, Puffham making goats
of the classy field. G. Podmore took the
Lackham gelding straight to the front, where
he safely withstood all challenges. Abbeville,
twice previously beaten by the winner, finished
fairly for second money, and a stoutly sus-
tained run from near the tail of the big field
carried Blue Legend into third place. How-
ever, neither was making any impression on
the winner at the finish, and he’ll be meeting
(hem both on 51b. better terms in the Epsom.
Another who made every post a winning post
was Kiaree (E. Fordyce) in the 11-furiongs
Spring Handicap. Kiaree lasted it out to down
Invictus and Air Flare in a dose finish. Evi-
dently now striking his best form, Invictus
has won over the Metrop. distance and could
be a chance with only 7.2.
The Qpposite extreme in winning style was
demonstrated by Mulley on Active Service,
coming from near-last to first in the length
of the straight to beat Night Robe, Gay
Monarch and some 16 others in the Welter.
The younger brigade didn’t get much of a
look in on the Three- and Four-year-old Handi-
cap won by Young Veilmond (G. Moore) from
Edinburgh and Sajakeda, all four-year-olds.
One interesting Randwick runner was Spam
(Coup de Lyon-Spiora), a five-year-old gelding
imported from Ireland. He’s a pretty enough
beast —a tall chestnut built' on rather fine lines
—but racing folk shook their heads at his
four very high white socks, though some fair
performers have worn such things. Spam
finished a poor last in Bernborough’s race.
* * * *
The chap who wrote “Spring, the sweet
spring,” would be wise to shy clear of any
Melbourne punters who may happen to make
the grade to Paradise, presuming that’s where
he is. Since the season started the battle has
been fierce, and on Saturday at Caulfield the
downfalls successively rolled home at 20, 14,
50, 25, 15 and 50 to 1. Then a favorite won,
but that was like rubbing salt into the empty
pocket's.
A name like Queen of the Fairies might be
calculated to stop anything, but the Young
Idea-Fairy Mag filly burdened with it proved
a better stayer than the rest of the three-year-
olds of her sex in the mile Yarraman Handi-
cap, though Siesta (second) made a promising
bold showing; Sasti third.
The success of the three-year-old Charles
Fox-Aphrodite colt Sea Monarch, downing
Audacity, River Hero and a big field of others
in the six-furlongs Leslie Stuart Stakes, de-
monstrated both the value of shrewd placing
and the soundness of the turf adage “The
more they win the better the price.” This was
his toughest field, but, beginning at Geelong,
he’d won at his three previous starts, including
a last-start win at Flemington. Yet, at 14 to 1,
Sea Monarch was a comparative outsider.
He could trouble the best of his age in the
Caulfield Guineas, and could have a Derby
chance, too.
-•••••
There was good enough reason for Parevna
going out at fifties in the 12-furlongs Hampton
Handicap, recent form of the six-year-old son
of Parenthesis having been as dismal as a
defeated politician. Arduli and Bisley were
closest to him at the end, and Arduli, an
honest galloper, looked unlucky. Cherie Marie
ran a sluggish race; but it’s some time yet
to the Melbourne Cup.
For the Caulfield leg of the big double the
best run of the day looked to be that of
Valcurl. As consistent as ever, the Valiant
Chief five-year-old won the nine-furlongs Men-
tone Cup with a couple of lengths to spare
from Geronimo, with improving New Yorker
third. It was too short for Rainbird.
El Banco, Register and Reyinach respectively
won the divisions of the seven-furlongs Dande-
nong Welter and the colts and geldings sec-
tion of the Yarraman Handicap. Chief Pilot,
half a head behind El Banco, and Vanika,
another half-head away, put up pretty good
performances.

Lately passed on in England, Frank Bullock,
a great horseman in his day and well bred
for it: his father was a great roughrider in the
Victorian police. Born in Melbourne, Frank
piloted Blue Spec to victory in the 1905 Mel-
bourne Cup. From 1908 to 1913 he was first
jockey to the Royal Graditz stud in Germany,
and after that, till 1925, one of the best jockeys
in England. Westralian jockey Walter Sibbntt,
who has done well in India and England, is
his son-in-law.

For the benefit of an inquirer over the
ranges, and anyone else who may be interested,
the Oaks (Eng.) resulted:, Steady Aim, 1; lona,
2; Nelia, 3. They are respectively by Felstead,
Hyperion and Nearco. The conditions of the
Oaks, or rather “the 165th Renewal of the
Oaks Stakes,” bear quoting. Its of 100
sovereigns each with 2000 sovereigns added,
and the second and third horses receive 10
per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively of the
whole stake. • Breeders also have an interest,
with 700 sovereigns out of the stake distributed
4-2-1 among them for the placings. The owner
of Steady Aim received £6540 for his filly s
success in the severe 12-furlongs test.

English St. Leger winner Airborne (Precipi-
tation-Boquet), who figured in an oddity of
racing happenings when a fake film of him
“How much will I have for this?”
"You’ve had it!"
winning the St. Leger was accidentally screened
in London movie houses days before the event,
is one of those good greys that crop up from
time fo time. The 3-to-l bet against him
would be good odds, no doubt brought about
by his having been held by Fast and Fair to
a dead heat in the Stuntney Stakes last month,
when Airborne (as the Derby winner) started

There is an old saying in Maoriland,
“Australians can’t play football,” and it
must have been on many lips last week,
when a combined South Island team beat
the Union Rugby touring side by 21 to 9,
and N.Z. defeated it by 31 to 8. How-
ever, Maorilanders generously admit that
there are some grand players among the
tourists, holding them inferior in forward
play and combination —which is generally
the case. The representative match was
played at Dunedin before 30,000 paying
customers, and 5000 on Dunedin’s famed
Scotchman’s Hill.

In Saturday’s Rugby Union final at
North Sydney, Randwick, scoring all its
points in the last 15 minutes, defeated
Parramatta 13-9. Previously “Parra.” had
had much the better of things, and it
was attacking courageously when the bell
signalled the end of a great game. One
of its best men was the forward Minter,
M.M., and another forward, Milton Bott,
went over twice, while Schomberg, the
fullback, eclipsed his opposite number.
Randwick’s best were Cawsey and
a newcomer, Cox, Randwick is to meet
East in the “grand” final.

The V.F.L. season is closing in a regu-
lar blaze of glory. In the first semi-
final, on September 7, 60,000-odd
watched Melbourne kick four goals in
the last five minutes against Footscray
and turn defeat into victory. Last Satur-
day 77,370 made a record attendance and
paid a record gate of £8477 for a semi-
final to see Essendon and Collingwood
play a draw —the second semi-final draw
in V.F.L. history and the second time
Collingwood was in it; ’Wood’s first was
with Melbourne in 1928, and it won
the replay by a goal. With Essendon
named first, the quarter scores went
5.2-3.6, 6.5-7.12, 9.11-11.15, 14.16-13.22.
’Wood had a three-point lead well into
the “time-on” period. By then both sides
were almost too worn to kick the ball, so
strenuous was the game, and there was
much hand-passing. Essendon got two
quick points, had a last chance at goal,
but could only make a point, and the
teams staggered from the ground,
100 points each, while the crowd cheered
for minutes. They will replay the match
next Saturday.
An acrimoniously disputed try gave
Balmain a 13-12 victory over St. George
and the Sydney Rugby League premier-
ship. The attendance was round 32,(KM),
and quite 16,000 were absorbed in the
football. Others absorbed beer.

As expected, America outed Sweden in
the Davis Cup inter-zone final and quali-

beating Johansson and Bergelin with ease
in the singles matches. Talbert and
Mulloy combined for U.S.A. in the
doubles against Johansson and Bergelin,
but only scraped home 3-6, 9-7, 3-6, 6-0,
8-6. America, of course, could have put

Talbert and Mulloy.

Taxation in the Future
The need for war-time taxation on a
heavy scale arose from the fact that war
itself is a costly, wasteful business,
and that it was not logical (even if
expedient) to create a huge debt,
whether of a public nature or in
the form of bank-credit expansion, on
the “security” of war expenditure that
left practically nothing in the * way of an
asset behind. The war effort was a tax
on our manpower, production, materials
and economic strength, and in a strict
financial sense it should have been treated
as a monetary tax on the people. But it
was politically impossible to charge the
population with the full cost of war as
we went along, and the fact remains that,
up to June 30, 1945, with two months of
hostilities to go, taxation had paid for
only 34 p.c. of the cost of war, which
then totalled £2lll milhon in Australia’s
case. The rest of the outgo was financed
by borrowings of various kinds, includ-
ing credit expansion on a large scale.
Such a low proportion of Australian
war loans was actually taken up by indi-
viduals that credit expansion by the Com-
monwealth Bank and the savings banks
was particularly extensive, with the result
that the population, fully provided with
jobs, accumulated large savings that could
not be spent in the normal wa*y because
civilian production was cut back almost
in the proportion that munitions output
was increased. Today the people possess
savings approximately two and a half
times as great as before the war. The
actual wealth of the country, on analysis,
would probably be found to be less than
it was before the war —certainly very
little more at best. Our money today is
paper money, backed by national wealth.
The increase in money unaccompanied
by a corresponding growth in our real
wealth has produced a condition of con-
siderable inflation—a depreciation in the
buying-power of our money. In addition,
the burden of interest on the national
debt has grown from £46 million on June
30, 1939, to £7B million on March 31,
1946.
From the financial point of view it
would seem the right thing to do, in order
to prevent inflationary rises in costs and
prices and to reduce the war-debt burden,
to continue taxation on a high scale,
the proceeds causing a contraction of
public buying-power on the one hand
and a reduction of the debt on the other.
But we have to approach this inflation
problem from both its ends —from this
financial end in one case and from the
production end in the other. That is be-
cause, to the extent that we expand per
capita production, so do we counteract
the menace of excessive paper money—
inflation —and at the same time reduce
the burden of debt in relation to the
national income. Since heavy taxation is
a deterrent to production, particularly
taxation that is levied in a way that dis-
regards entirely incentives to produce,
we have to give the production side of
the inflation problem equal consideration
with the financial, and so in peace, as
in war, we must make a compromise and
give the taxpayer sufficient relief to allow
him to produce to the full, at the same
time doing what is possible to restrain
further growth in the national debt and
expansion of bank credit.
Entirely in keeping with this policy
will be a speedy contraction of unneces-
sary Government expenditure, and if it
is found that certain types of “social
security” are a deterrent to production
incentives as well as to adequate tax
reductions, then they, too, should be re-
appraised.
The Federal Labor party has shown
little readiness to reduce its Budget spend-
ing now that the war is over. It has
shown equal reluctance to cut down taxa-
tion. And it has shown no desire what-
soever to reduce the national debt.
In the circumstances its financial policy
remains weak and shapeless as well as
menacing. In 1945-46 its Budget expen-
diture was given out as being £5lO mil-
lion, with civil spending still mounting,
compared with £76 million in the last
pre-war year. The latest figure was un-
doubtedly larger than that officially
claimed, having had deducted from it a
number of large credits more properly to
be regarded as revenue than offsets to
current spending. All that the Labor
party has been able to offer for the
present term has been a reduction of £l5O
million on its 1945-46 rate of spending.
This would still leave the Budget a multi-
plication of the pre-war total.
The growth in taxation since 1939 is
shown by the following table:
1938-39. 1945-46.
£ £
Customs and excise 47,632,000 77,961,000
Sales tax 9,308,000 33,600,000
Flour tax 1,809,000 1,780,000
Land tax 1,489,000 3,782,000
Income fax .. .. 11,882,000 181,900,000
Payroll tax .... 11,499,000
Estate duty .. .. 1,915,000 3,880,000
Gift duty 393,000
Gold excise .... 384,000
Entertainments tax .. 4,304,000
Miscellaneous .. .. 2,780,000 7,209,000
76,815t000 326,692,000
In those figures repayments of income
tax and amusement tax to the States have
been deducted. Even so, it will be seen
that tax collections are £250 million
heavier than before the war —about three
and a half times greater—whilst income
tax, the greatest deterrent to production
incentives, but the most anti-inflationary
in the strictly financial sense, has been
multiplied over 15 times.
The Liberal party has promised the
country tax reductions of at least 20 p.c.
from January, 1947, if returned to office.
Accompanied by a judicious paring-down
of Government expenditure and a firm
stand against industrial anarchy the pro-
position should be entirely practicable,
with progressive tax reductions as time
goes on. From figures given it should
be quite apparent that the increased in-
terest burden on the 1939-45 war debt
is only a matter of £32 million or so a
year, and that even if the charge eventu-
ally settles down at £4O million a year
it does not offer grounds for taxation
rates permanently at their present con-
fiscatory scale.
We have come to a stage where we
must prepare to acknowledge, over the
next couple of years, the amount of
war-time inflation that has taken place in
our financial system, make every effort to
curb further unsound credit expansion,
and, with production rising and costs and
prices stabilising at a higher level, get
ready to free our economy from heavy
taxes and artificial “controls” that
merely prolong or cloak weaknesses that
would be better exposed and rooted out.
Objects of the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment, whichever party is in office,
should be:
(1) To avoid socialism through high,
ambition-destroying taxation and restric-
tion of private enterprise.
(2) To shape Budget policy so as to give
private enterprise full production and em-
ployment incentives —to reduce taxes to the
level of the expense of good administra-
tion ( plus necessary social welfare and
defence costs), to avoid unnecessary re-
strictions and interference, to encourage
industrial harmony, and to aid in the scrap-
ping of obsolete productive and transport
systems, whether owned Governmentally or
privately. Every effort should be made to
produce a balanced Budget in these days
of high employment and underproduction.
(3) To charge private enterprise with the
responsibility of maintaining a high level
of employment under conditions of reason-
able industrial discipline.
(4) To aim, eventually, at a free price
level, acknowledging that the recent war
has created an excess of money that cannot
be sterilised for ever, but which may be
offset, so far as prices are concerned, to
a large extent by greater output and lower
costs of production achieved through willing
workers and greater industrial efficiency.
It must be plain to most that present
high taxation is to a large extent based
on extravagant Government spending,
which should be eliminated rapidly in
order to reduce the severity of our pre-
sent production crisis, and to the ex-
tent that taxation is being used as an
anti-inflationary measure it can only be
successful so long as it does not notice-
ably affect production adversely. We
must, therefore, aim ultimately at reach-
ing full production at a higher-than-pre-
war, stable level of costs and prices that
has been subjected to the full onslaught of
banked-up war-time spending power.
Artificial interference with the price level
for more than a couple of years is likely
to defeat its own purposes. Controls can
do their most valuable work merely as
a temporary shock-absorber.
The whole field of Government ex-
penditure must be re-examined. The
social-security proposals will need close
—but fully appreciative—scrutiny to see
that the people get fair value in return
for their taxes, swollen departmental ex-
penditures should be given as much atten-
tion but less sympathy, Government busi-
ness ventures —like the losing shipping
undertaking—should be relinquished, and
the matter of a continuance or otherwise
of price subsidies, at present costing over
£3O million a year, should be investigated.
Price subsidies used as a palliative
against inflation are only an emergency
measure, and once the national economy
reapproaches equilibrium, whether at a
higher level of costs and prices or not,
price subsidies should be discontinued as
something representing an indiscriminate
and discouraging tax upon the popula-
tion.
In the future our defence planning
should be more comprehensive than be-
fore the war, but it should be made to
dovetail in more with peace-time enter-
prise, with research and the training of
expert officers given more attention than
the continuous production of munitions
that grow obsolete without use.. A more
effective defence arm may thus be de-
veloped at much smaller expense.
A factor which must not be overlooked
in valuing ordinary shares listed on the
Stock Exchange is that of credit inflation
which has extended into costs and prices.
In many parts of the world during the war
ordinary shares in industrial companies,
houses, land, gold, diamonds, etc., were
bought as a “hedge” against the inflation
which, it was believed, was bound to
cause a heavy fall in the ultimate buying-
power of currencies. In Australia
there was no free market for any of these
things, with the possible exception of
diamonds, and we were never able to see
the full effect of war-time credit expan-
sion before us —not even in the cost of
living, in respect of which price-control,
as a temporary measure, was successful
in restraining to an impressive degree.
But whilst prices have been masked by
controls for several years, spending-
power has continued to mount, with the
result that it had grown to £1516 million
in Australia on June 30 last, compared
with £613 million seven years earlier—
a growth of 147 p.c. This expansion is
bound to alter property values of all
kinds in the long run, and it is logical
that share prices in many cases should
rise to a higher figure than existed before
the war. It will be a good thing if they
do not rise too high, as high prices for
shares and property eventually have a
tendency to bring about overcapitalisa-
tion in industry. But apart from the in-
flation question, which cannot be ignored,
in whatever light it is regarded, Austra-
lian industries have prospects of high
activity ahead of them for years to come,
and to get on with the necessary work
ahead there will have to be a promise
of reasonable dividend return offering to
the proprietary side of industry. If
earning-power and property values swing
into line with other post-war economic
conditions, restoring a desirable balance
to our economy, then higher share prices
seem certain in the case of many key in-
vestments, with new capital issues likely
in addition.. Some explanation of this
probability is necessary in view of the
present uncertainty in the investment
market caused by artificial Government
controls, heavy taxation, industrial
lethargy and overseas influences.

R. T. Vanderfield, chairman of
Vanderfield and Reid, Ltd., Sydney, has
said that in pre-war days at least a third
of all timber used in Australia was im-
ported, but only nominal quantities are
now coming in. Local production is also
low, and transport facilities are sadly
deficient. Mr. Vanderfield contends that
if the N. S. Wales Forestry Department
could make logs available over and above
country sawmills’ capacity and the rail-
ways could transport the logs to Sydney,
plants at present idle in the city would
be capable of turning out an extra
3,000,000 super, feet of manufactured
timber a month. His company alone has
a plant capable of producing 500,000 ft.
of timber a month.

Total overseas funds of Australia on
the last Monday in June this year were
£215.4 million, compared with £208.3
million a year earlier and £55.7 million in
June, 1939. Annual movement in the
funds —figures supplied by the Common-
wealth Bank—has been as follows:
June, fmillion. June, £million.
1939 .. 55.7 1943 .. 86.8
1940 .. 71.7 1944 .. 182.5
1941 .. 89.5 1945 .. 208.3
1942 .. 69.1 1946 .. 215.4
Last year’s improvement of £7.1 million
was achieved in the face of repayment of
£43 million of overseas debt, making a
net gain of over £5O million. In 1944-45
we paid off £l5 million of overseas debt,
and in 1943-44 £22.6 million. The huge
expansion in our holding of overseas
money in 1943-44 was largely the result
of the spending by U.S. forces of their
dollar pay in the Commonwealth. More
recently the steadier but less spectacular
growth in our external funds has been the
result of steady sale of our surplus pro-
ducts, recoveries from other Governments
in respect of services rendered by us to
their troops in Australia, a retarded flow
of imports resulting from shipping and
manufacturing difficulties overseas, and
“substantial payments by the United
Kingdom in respect of the Royal Navy
based in Australia.” The Commonwealth
Bank points out that undue optimism is
not warranted in the present buoyancy of
our overseas funds, mentioning that war
in the Pacific brought us non-recurring
windfalls, and that we still owe money
in respect of similar items to other coun-
tries. Mr. Chifley recently mentioned
£8 million owing to the United States for
a washing-up of lend-lease and £2O mil-
lion due to the United Kingdom. As
soon as overseas supply and transport
difficulties are overcome the central bank
expects a flow of badly needed essential
imports, cost of which will draw on our
external-currency reserves. Over the war
period import costs have risen higher than
prices of our exports, and this condition
of things must have an adverse effect on
our funds so long as it persists.

The governor of the central bank, Mr,
H. T. Armitage, believes that * Australia
should be a partner in the Bretton Woods
plans. He says:
It is my view that by active participation
in the international monetary fund, where
she may be successful in obtaining a voice
on the governing body, Australia would
be playing her proper part in shaping the
future and at the same time safeguarding
her own interest by helping to ensure that
the problems of young and developing
countries, some of which share Australia’s
apprehensions, receive due consideration by
the larger Powers.
Mr. Armitage’s opinion is not, of course,
shared by Eddie Ward.
♦ ♦ * *
In considering the future of share
prices, investors should be entitled to take
notice of the reduction in company
profits (after payment of taxes) that has
taken place during the war and after
purely as the result of price-control and
heavy special company taxes. Common-
wealth Bank statistics show that earnings
of over 500 representative companies
have fallen from 6.8 p.c. on funds since
1939 to 5.9 p.c. in 1945. In this period
the Federal basic wage rose from 795. to
around £5 a week, and the cost of living,
as calculated by the Commonwealth
Statistician, was in similar proportion.
The earnings of the proprietary side of
industry have thus been very low in pro-
portion to the money earnings of wage-
earners, and it should be remembered
that price-control and heavy company
taxes operate regardless of whether a
business is small (where the personal in-
centive is almost everything) or large
(where the capital is usually subscribed by
a large number of small investors).
Industry and business even now are not
allowed to take full advantage of trading
opportunities, and this forbearance
should be allowed an ultimate reward.
Manufacturers, mining cos. and others
bore many burdens during war-time
which it is not fair to ask them to carry
in perpetuity. Company-controlled in-
dustries must have equal production in-
centives with any other type of effort,
and the prevailing special burdens borne
in these cases will have to be removed as
our economy frees itself from war-
time disabilities. It is noteworthy that,
while interest rates on two-year fixed
deposits have been cut in halves since
1939, average rates on first mortgages in
N, S. Wales have declined only from 5.5
p.c. to 4.9 p.c. Interest rates on long-
dated Commonwealth loans have not de-
clined more than 20 p.c., and at that the
market is far from satisfied with the terms
offered. Government loans have been
filled mainly from savings-bank deposits
passed on by those institutions to the
Commonwealth Treasury. A higher
general rate of company dividend would
not be incompatible with low interest
rates.

According to some who have had an
opportunity of looking over the factory,
shareholders in Burlington Mills, Ruther-
ford (N.S.W.), appear to be on a good
thing. The plant is efficient and the labor-
supply of satisfactory standard. The co.
is weaving rayon fabrics from imported
yarn, and, though full production is still
a long way off, initial output has been
promising. The £1 ords., ex a recent
new issue, are in demand at 485,, with
few sellers. There has been a strong rise
over the past three months.
* * * *
With all the demand that exists for
textiles, particularly worsteds, Yarra
Falls has not found it desirable to pay
a dividend higher than 9 p.c. for the year
to June 30. Labor problems and high
taxation have afflicted textile cos. all
through the war. Yarra Falls is the
country’s biggest worsted enterprise, and
it has established a high standard for its
products. Bradford Cotton Mills has
maintained its ord. div. at 10 p.c. for
1945-46. This, too, is a reduction on pre-
war rates. Even though there was great
expansion in the textile industry during
the war, shareholders got little in the way
of extra dividends on the money they
had invested. Shareholders’ hopes rest
in lower post-war taxation and increased
labor supplies, these things together bring-
ing an increased production from which
both shareholder and wage-earner should
benefit.

eyed the patient. “Well,” he said, “the

idea there’s a Bush Nurse about here.”
He went out and I stayed with Mat. The

“Old-timer”: I picked up with the
drover an hour or so out of his night
camp and accepted his invitation to stay
the night. He had four good dogs work-
ing the sheep—so good that he merely
glanced around from time to time as he
sat in his waggonette. Under the vehicle
a gangling, skewbald dog with a wall eye
ambled along on a chain. The more I
looked at this freak the more convinced
I became that it was no good for sheep
and silently wondered what the drover
kept it for. With the hessians out I
knocked up a few rock cakes while he
made a stew; then we fed ourselves and
the hounds, washed up and prepared to
relax. He put his four workers on the
chains and released the other one. It
raced madly five times around the camp,
wiped its mouth enthusiastically on the
drover’s face, stood on its hind legs, yiped
at the stars, dug holes, chased shadows
and generally performed like a canine
clown. The four workers lay with their
“Don’t forget , Cyril—just stonewall !”
heads on their forepaws and regarded
this foolishness with weary, boredom, but
the drover laughed and shouted humor-
ous remarks at the frolicker. “Gripes,” I
said, astonished, “you’ll never make a
sheep dog out o’ him if y’ let him go on
like that.” “Sheep dog!” he echoed, “I
got enough sheep dogs. Look at ’em.
They wouldn’t grin for sixpence. Strike
me, there’s nothin’ more serious in the
world than a sheep dog. He’s only happy
when’ he’s workin’ an’ spends the rest o’
the time gloomin’ till work starts again. I
keep ol’ Comic Cuts there because he
likes playin’ the fool —gives me somethin’
t’ laugh at of a night. Gripes, a man’d
go barmy with sad-lookin’ jumbucks an’
dead-serious jumbuck hounds if he didn’t
have somethin’ to act the goat.”

“Carnie”: At least our crows haven’t
yet plumbed the depths of avian infamy
and mischief to which their sable fellows
in England have sunk. There they swoop
to pinch seed potatoes as soon as the
planter’s back is turned. If they are foiled
at planting-time they will try to root
out the tuber just as it sprouts, and will
eat every shoot.

“Puyyaka”: Although, as “Zake” says
(B. 28/8/’46), generally blamed for the
fell deed, Thomas Austin, of Barwon
Park, did not introduce the first rabbits to
Victoria. The real offender was a neigh-
bor of his, Major Fyans, a peppery old
retired officer of the Honorable East
India Company’s service, after whom is
named Fyansford on the Barwon River,
outside Geelong. In 1852 the fiery old
warrior was fined a fiver for having pep-
pered with a shotgun two men on their
way to the Ballarat diggings because they
had trespassed on his property and
poached three of his rabbits, bred from
imported English stock. But those earlier
rabbit generations did not multiply as
rapidly as have their descendants. In
1863 my subsequent father, young and a
crack shot, was invited to a rabbit-shoot-
ing party at Barwon Park. Warned by his
host that three brace was the limit, after
which he must walk with the guns, he
got his three brace, but only by well on
into the afternoon.

“Goldie”; There were Charlie Pike,
Jimmy O’Day, the newchum and myself
sprawled out at various angles round the
flickering campfire. “Oom, oom, oom,”
went the booming voice of the night.
“Spare me,” says Charlie in a quavering
voice. “It’s the f’rocious mountain alba-
tross at death-grips with a wild Hereford
bull.” “Y’re wrong,” Jimmy weeps. “It’s
the blood-lustin’ yelp of the vampire
wombat.” “No,” 1 get in shakily. “It
sounds more like a team of them wild
mountain goats wot et the hatter at Jam-
tin Crick.” But the newchum hasn’t
turned ai hair. “It’s the female frog-
mouth podargus,” he says, “hollerin’ to
her male what a ruddy lot of dopes in-
habit this vicinity.” Then he downed a
pannikin of scalding tea at a gulp and
hit his bunk.
* * * •
“Salmon Gums”: I can understand
“Bogaduck” failing to extract sap from
the roots of salmon-gums (B. 7/8/’46).
Those stately trees, with their distinctive
salmon-colored bark and umbrella tops,
are far from being the hardest timber in
the Westralian wheatbelt. Although ap-
preciably harder than jarrah, they aren’t
comparable with wodgil, dead-finish or
even white-gum—but they must be very
nearly the driest. A sizable jarrah, felled
and left lying in the paddock, will take
15 to 20 years to dry out completely;
but a salmon-gum will burn readily
within a few months. In fact, it’s
customary to fell in winter and burn off
the following summer, and with a slight
breeze to fan the flame a recently-
chopped salmon-gum will burn to an ash.
Its dryness is understandable when it is
remembered that it grows in districts
where the ground is bone-dry for at
least six months of the ye^r; but the
kuirajong, which grows under worse
conditions, yields considerable quantities
of moisture from its tapped roots. It’s
a peculiarity of plant life that while some
of the leafy inhabitants of the dry areas
take the hard way and accustom them-
selves to a minimum of moisture, others
“bank” enough in times of plenty to tide
them over the lean months. And per-
haps there’s a moral in the fact that the
communistic mistletoe flourishes on the
laboring salmon-gum but doesn’t get far
with the capitalist kurrajong.
* * * «
“Bufo”; That schoolchild whom
“Potrero” (B. 4/9/’46) records as having
depicted “a six-legged insect when asked
to draw something out of her head” was
entomologically correct, and deserved
commendation for her knowledge.
Amongst all the world’s innumerable in-
sects every single one of them begins
adult life with six legs, one pair to each
of its three thoracic segments. It is one
of the anatomical features which dis-
tinguish the Insc’cta from all other crea-
tures. Incidentally, “chats” start to grow
wings during their larval stage, but
luckily do not finish the job later on. So
do fleas. We certainly have been spared
a lot by Providence!
♦ * * *
“Blime”: Ted ran an appraising eye
over the stumps still standing. “If I've
got t’ have this paddock ready fr the
tractor by mornin’,” he mused, “there
ain’t time t’ burn them things. Better
jack ’em out” Returning to the shed,
a search reminded him he had lent his
jack to a neighbor six months before.
He made for his ancient tourer. “No,
Mac isn’t home,” the neighbor’s missus
informed him some 20 minutes later,
“but I think he’s working over near the
river.” An hour’s searching located Mac.
“Y’r jack,” he said thoughtfully. “Ah,
yair; old Bob borrered it fr that back
fence o’ his. Didn’t ’e return it?” Two
hours later Ted ran Bob down, “Jack?”
queried the old bloke. “Yair, I ’member
somethin’ ’bout a jack. That’s right,
Smithie took it t’ shift some logs, but I
think Mick Patterson ’ad it after that.
Anyway, Smithie’ll know. He’s workin’
out Dry Gully way.” The sun was setting
when Ted found Patterson. “Yair, I ’ad
it over on Stony Top,” Patterson ex-
plained “Got y’r car? Good. If we
drive t’ the back fence we won’t ’ave
more’n half a mile or so t’ walk. Knew
y’ wouldn’t mind me usin’ it,” he went
on. “I alwus say us blokes ought t’
share more of our tools ’n’ things. Save
us a lot time ’n’ trouble.”

“Yagoo”: It is probable that the
carved baob nut, referred to by “J. Ril-
ston” (B. 21 /8 / ’46), came from around
Carnot Bay or was carved by one of the
few remaining Carnot Bay boys. The
radio-aerial headdress is a main feature
of one of their most popular dances. In
addition to the headdress they carry a
wand in each hand which is also
decorated with the wanninge. The dance
is performed by three men and is done in
four parts ; each dancer doing a solo and
ending with a grand finale in which all
three take part, I agree with “J. Rilston”
that the headdress is mystical, for al-
though I supplied the red, white and black
wool which is now substituted for the
once-used native yarn the boys would
give me no explanation of the wanninge
other than the fact that it made them
proper flash!

“Woody”: My morning paper carried
a report on Ben, an alleged talking dog
of Hertfordshire, reported to say in a
“dark brown” voice, “1 want one.” To
prove it, a photo, was published of Ben
sitting erect before two vets who were
pensively stroking their chins. Then
Ripley produced a “speaking” dog from
California that “actually speaks a num-
ber of words as clearly as a human.”
That isn’t ail. A chap I work with knows
a bloke Whose dog makes noises like
“Mum” when he’s hungry and “Dad”
when he’s thirsty. This sort of thing can
go too far. Imagine how a bloke would
feel if, when the whole household had
a go at him, he retired to the garden only
to get an ear-bashing from his kelpie.
* * * •
“Lower Tops’l”: I’ll back the Bay of
Fires on the nor’-east coast of Tassie as
the home of kelp. For some miles to
seaward of that 33 miles stretch of bay
the ocean surface is rippled by masses of
floating kelp, which incidentally harbors
as good a crayfishing ground as there is
in Australia. Fishing there years ago
we’d simply haul up a piece of the giant
weed and, coming to the stem, we would
make fast to it. Moored to that weed
the 30-ton ketch often rode out half a
gale of wind.

“Potrero”: Now Aboliars have dis-
cussed outsizes in crocodiles, what’s the
biggest anyone has seen in his
sober moments? Years ago we had a
pet on Toorak (N.Q.), which a jackeroo
brought home as a youngster in his shirt.
Wethered, the big red hopper grew to 7ft
6in., and was built in proportion. He was
the biggest ’roo I’ve seen, though he later
got too big for his claws. He took to
boxing and his end came one day when
he inadvertently clouted the manager.

“B. A. Ker”: On the way out to our
place to look at a cow the old chap and
his son had noticed Johnno, who lived in
the humpy down the road. “Must be a
ratbag,” the older man declared. “There
he was standin’ near the hive, catchin
bees, shovin’ ’em in his pants, then
hoppin’ about like one of them Yankee
chatterbugs.” Fred spoke up for
Johnno’s sanity; “That’s his method of
curin’ the ‘screws’—-reckons half a dozen
stings does the trick.” The visitor was
frankly an* unbeliever. He also ridiculed
Bert’s “best cure for the screws”— flog
the affected part with a stinging nettle.
Dad’s remedy—a medicine concocted
from marshmallows and dandelions re-
ceived a resounding guffaw. And Lanks
liniment, a blend of olive oil, camphor,
eucalyptus, metho. and a generous
amount of red pepper, was given as short
a hearing as Jumb’s advocacy of a hot
bath containing cloudy ammonia and
vinegar. “Superstition, pure superstition,
declared the heretic as he accepted the
receipt, creakily levered himself out 0i
the chair and prepared to depart. Mum
noticed it first. “Look at that round,
damp stain on your father’s pants,” she
said. “He must have sat on something-
I’ll get something to wipe it off. ’ The
youngster grinned, then whispered: No,
he hasn’t sat on anything; that’s the slice
of raw spud he always carries in his hip
pocket. Swears it’s a certain cure for the
screws.’ ”

work to be had at Tenandra, up in the
Marthaguy country. After doing several
trips to Calgoora he struck across to
Goodooga, where he sold his wagon. He
bought another cheap at a sale and
“worked his way” across the Queensland
border to Euligal. Carting along the
Macintyre, he eventually sold his outfit
for a good price at Bengalla. Back over
“You have my sympathy—l HATE shopping for the wife.”
the N.S.W. border at Silent Grove, he
picked up a new team and wagon and got
some lucrative carting, gradually working
south. It was early one evening, about
18 months after he had left, that he
pulled in home. As the wagon rolled to
a stop Mrs. Carliss poked her head out
the kitchen door. She looked be-
fore recognising the bearded figure. “Oh,
it’s you, Jim,” she said. “Y’re just in
time. The wick in that petrol lamp’s

“Max”: Building materials must be as
short in the bird world as in our own.
Mrs. Blue Wren built her first nest in a
clipped privet near our door, as in former
years, but was soon engaged in a struggle
with sparrows which she lost. Her nest-
ing material disappeared. Her second
nest she started behind the house in a
Gardenia globosa, and again the hi-
jackers beat her. She began a third near
the first in a low lantana hedge and once
again was bullied off the site. Frustrated,
dishevelled and slightly crazy, she now
sits all day on a pear branch outside my
window, making suicidal attacks on her
reflection in the glass or perhaps shadow-
sparring for the next engagement.

“Spooks”: King of bluffers is the com-

few are unafraid of his lowered head,
open beak, sinister hiss and baleful eye.
He can’t kick, butt or bite, but he gets
away with his threat.

“Naturala”: That borer grub which
“G’snatcher” unearthed from his jarrah
bed-posts (B. 14/8/’46) was the larva of
the Longicorn beetle. One time when
living in a clearing chopped from the
jarrah forest, with lately-felled trunks and
“This’ll make a good bumper-bar!"
limbs all around, I found it possible to
sit outside and hear that crunching noise,
so audible that it might readily have been
taken up by the microphone—thousands
of borers at work. It was interesting, too,
on a warm night to sit with the hurricane
lamp and watch the reddish colored adult
beetles busy at their courtship. But
despite that at times they will multiply
into thousands, the Longicorns are not
really plentiful. Growing jarrah seems to
have a defence against them, the thick
woolly bark preventing the female from
depositing her eggs. But given a wound
in the bark, or a freshly-cut limb, the
eggs will be deposited at that point.
Infinitely small at birth, the grub grows
larger as it eats its way along, generally
half in the sapwood, half in the bark.
* * * *
“Bozo”: “Lower Tops’l” and his mates
(B. 28/8/’46) waste their time chas-
ing quail. For real exercise they
should try running down an emu.
All you need is sound wind, strong
legs, a pair of binoculars and an
emu. You are not in the race at first —
the bird soon fades into the horizon, but
you can follow his dust with the glasses.
Pretty soon he settles down for a quiet
scratch in the mulga and you catch up
nine or ten miles. Knowing he can still
lick you the emu lets you get within half
a mile or so and then bolts. Don’t be
discouraged. Keeping up a steady jog
trot you tail him to the next stop —this
time you get a bit closer before he legs
it again. Ten to one he skirts the ridges,
so you cut off a few miles by going
straight over, and there he is pecking in
the spinifex. Keep this up and at each
stop you get closer and closer till at last
the bird is so used to seeing you around
that he lets you walk right up and clap
a bridle over his beak. Then ride him
home and that’s all there is to it. Quail
—bah!

“Kennis”: The candidate had just be-
gun to expound the policy of his party
when in staggered Mick, well oiled. Roll-
ing solemnly up the aisle, he took a front
seat and there remained, swaying slightly,
during the address. Came question time,
and Mick staggered to his feet and
began a spluttering tirade. A mate pulled
at Mick’s sleeve. “Hey, Mick,” he whis-
pered, “that’s Spouter, our man, ye’re
talkin’ to.” Mick took it in. “Gripes,” he
ejaculated ; “I must be in the wrong hall.”

“Solitude”: In his excitement as the
goals mounted up, young Stuart had
wandered around the boundary of the
football field, away from the crowd.
Presently he became aware of an old
bloke leaning on the road fence. The
faded eyes took in the teams, the line
of spectators, and finally the pavilion.
“Interested in the match?” Stuart in-
quired affably. The grey head came
round. “Well, no, but them youngsters
out there, playin’.. .whatever it is they’re
playin’, reminds me o’ forty or fifty year
ago when we used t’ play football on this
here flat. ’Course there wus a good few
bumps on her in them days, an’ I see
they’ve took off all the rocks.” “Played
for Stony Ridge, did you?” “That’s
right,” agreed the old bloke. “Used t’
ride in from sixteen miles up river, an’
one week me nag got lorst an’ I had f
break-in another on the Sat’dee mornin’,
t’ get here. Twenty-two fights among
the players after the match that day,
’stead o’ the usual eighteen. We. was
playin’ the Bunyips, an’ I tell y’ it wus
tough work t’ keep ’em frum scorin’.”
“You mean, they didn’t score at all?”
“Not a point, sonnie,” drawled the old
voice proudly. “So that made the game a
draw.” It was then I collared Seventy-
fiver, and we made tracks.

“Chuck”: Bung scowled as the town-
ship’s nuisance lurched through the door-
way. “No good you looking for a bed,
Buff, there’s none left,” he lied irritably.
“Can’t you see I got to put up the visit-
ing football team?” Buff eyed him„then
took himself to the bar parlor. At
eleven the mob drifted bedward, and a
bit after twelve Bung locked a few doors
and departed to the back regions, leav-
ing Buff to watch the dying coals. Fol-
lowed an hour of peace ; then the heavy
tramp of hobnailed boots sounded
through the pub passage. Up and down
they went several times; then a cracked
voice broke into song. “Nobody shleeps
while the Buffalo freezes,” came the
words. “Nobody shleeps”... Doors
opened, boots flew down the passage and
the air was heavy with candid advice.
Buff explained the position. “Well, why
ain’t y’ got a bed? Where’s Bung?”
came the chorus, and presently a bang-
ing on Bung’s door was followed by in-
dignant demands from the part-clad
visitors. “Cripes,” gasped Bung as he
shivered back to the blankets ten minutes
later, “who’d ’a’ thought the old coot was
so popular!”

“Exkewex”: Carpet snakes are gener-
ally credited with being able to swallow
anything, but I’ve seen two come to a bad
end through tackling a flying fox. Each
time the meal was tackled in the orthodox
head-first manner and each time the
hooks on the big bat’s wings, which it
uses as a kind of hand when climbing,
caught on each side of the snake’s ex-
tended throat. Joe was apparently un-
able to regurgitate the meal —backward
curving teeth would be a handicap—and
apparently either choked or (less pro-
bably) starved with a meal actually in its
mouth. Any Aboliar know if Joe ever
handles flying fox successfully? And
can any N’th Q’land observer confirm or
deny the yam that a lot of rock pythons
have come to a bad end through swallow-
ing the oversized toads imported into
those parts to deal with cane beetles?

“Uramao”; The ancients among the
Maoris believed that the spirits of the
dead traversed the Ninety-mile Beach to
Spirits Bay, in the extreme northern tip
of Maoriland, there to hop off for the
Elysian fields of the Maori. Two worften,
learning that at the end of the tunnel
through which the spirits passed there was
eternal fire, conspired to get some of it.
Arrived at Spirits Bay they took a header,
found the mouth of the tunnel, and at the
end saw what they sought, with two
spirit guardians on duty. Biding their
time till the guardians slept the
wahines crept past. One seized a brand
from the eternal fire and both fled. The
sentries awoke and gave chase. The
woman carrying the torch had reached
the mouth of the tunnel when one of the
sentries caught her feet. The woman
hurled the blazing brand with great force
up into the sky, where it became a ball of
fire. Anyone examining the full moon
will see across its face the brand the
wahine stole when the world was young.

“Hanko”: It looks as if “Gravel-

Wog an apology, for according to a tome
titled Leaves from the Book of Nature
quail do cross the Mediterranean, and
they perform the feat by using one wing
as a sail and the other as an aquaplane.
It could be so ; still, I’d back turbulent
Bass Strait to stop the little brown navi-
gators.

“Esk D.”: Bert had been calling at
Hobbs’ each Sunday for several years
and, though no word had been spoken or
outward manifestation of affection shown,
it was generally conceded that he was
“courting” Hettie, the eldest daughter.
Bert’s most absorbing interests centred in
his herd of Jerseys and a thoroughbred
mare he’d bought for a song. Mrs.
Hobbs, egged on by the family to settle
the uncertainty of Hettie s romance,
tackled him one evening after tea as he
helped her with the dishes. She winked
knowingly at him, glanced out the win-
dow to where Hettie was feeding the
poddy lambs; then “When’s it goin’ to
be, Bert?” she asked. “Eh?” stammered
Bert, blushing deep red. “Aw, it won’t
be long now. ’S a matter o’ fact, it’ll be
about the 23rd o’ next month.” Mrs.
Hobbs looked surprised. “Does Hettie
know?” she asked.» It was Bert’s turn to
register surprise. “Hettie? Aw, square
up, Mrs. Hobbs,” he said. “A bloke
doesn’t go round confidin’ in single wim-
min about his mare goin’t’ have a foal!”

THE MAN ON TH E LAND
" DON'T WOR RY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
Classing.
“R. Ney”; Remarking that several
factors caused the undesirable small lots
now evident on wool floors—lots in
Queensland now average only four bales
and ih other States only two—R. Bebar-
fald, a wool expert, added that labor
shortage and droughts had reduced cul-
ling so that clips were more irregular,
leading again to small lotting.
The classer’s job is to group the wools
together for sale, not keep them apart,
and it seems that a broader outlook is
needed by all hands. Classing is merely
a preliminary grading and is not expected
to meet the exacting demands of sorting.
A classer should make his lines and
class to them irrespective of changes in
flocks. In one flock there could be a lot
of AAA wool, not so much in a second
and even less in a third. Thus in the
second and third clips an extra line or
two may be necessary, but it will work
out for the best in the long run. In any
normal merino flock the classer should
not have to go beyond fine, medium or
broad—frequently two lines will cover it
—and in comebacks and crossbreds the
ordinary standards of fine CBK, fine X,
medium X, X and CX, with a secondary
line for each, should do the job.
There should be no doubt on what con-
stitutes length, so long as the classer
knows trade requirements. Style takes in
density, tear, color, appearance and even
vegetable fault. Style is most important,
and in higher class wools and leading lines
of standard clips it calls for more selec-
tive classing. Most Australian clips, how-
ever, are purely “bread and butter” lines
and in these the varieties could well be
limited. It isn’t really necessary to iso-
late wools for different degrees of tender-
ness, and a classer could work on fairly
broad lines at the lower end of the clip.
Superficial details can be ignored, since
they’re never so noticeable on the show
floors. Mixed or composite bales should
be avoided. It can be done by judicious
blending or by instructing the broker to
class the odd sorts himself.
Blackleg in Cattle.
“Plane Creek”: Blackleg makes short
work of most beasts under three years of
age ; most sufferers beyond that age mend.
It’s caused by a non-migrating germ that
thrives in badly-drained soil. There’s a
widespread belief that overfeeding with
rich tucker predisposes cattle to the
disease, and they’re said to be rendered
susceptible when good feed abruptly suc-
ceeds non-nutritive stuff. It’s chiefly a
summer disease. At first there are stupor
and weakness, temperature soars, breath-
ing is labored. These symptoms increase
as soft, active swellings appear on parts
of the body and develop with great speed.
When touched, imprisoned gas in the
swellings moves with a crackling sound.
Decomposed blood escapes from lanced
swellings. Lancing relieves the victim
somewhat, but has no effect on the dis-
ease. Paralysis and death succeed the
swellings. Blackleg has been known to
kill its victims within 12 hours, but the
end generally comes from 24 hours to
three days after the onset of the disease.
Treatment is useless. The only thing
to do is isolate the victims immediately
and destroy dead bodies with fire or
quicklime. Understanding stockmen will

shoot hopelessly ill beasts, rather than
see them suffer terribly. There are reliable
and inexpensive blackleg vaccines on the
market. A liquid vaccine injected under
the skin with a hypodermic syringe gives
immunity for many months. Make
branding time vaccination time. The
vaccine takes 10 days or so to give full
protection, so don’t holler about the dope
if you have blackleg cases two or three
days after treatment.

Investigations in England show a loss of
p.c. of organic matter m 50 years; in
Amenca the loss was 38 p.c. in 60 years,
and this brought about the dustbowl.
That was when artificials only were used ;
w ere organic manures only were used
there was practically no loss.
Sir John Russell, m Soils and Manures,
gives much the same findings: In

a ! ndrogeu , was lost in 20
years cultivation ; m Saskatchewan Shutt
observed a loss of 30 p.c. of tne nitrogen
a tei a similar period. With the organic
matter are lost also the advantages it con-
ferred; the soil becomes impoverished
and liable to erosion ; and if much clay
is present it becomes difficult and expen-
sive to cultivate.
Dr. Phipps quotes investigations in the
wheat areas of South Australia, where
wheat yields were steadily declining—a
serious matter in view of the improvement
which had taken place in fertilisers, wheat
varieties, etc. It could be attributed en-
tirely to the destruction of organic matter,
the soils thereby losing their fertility and
structure.
Dr. Forster apparently only talks of
farmyard manure ; that is only one form
of organic manure. The one most suit-
able to the wheat areas is the temporary
pasture and grazing animal method.
There are many examples of the benefit
of this practice in our wheat areas, both
as regards the bulk of the crop and its
food content. * This is what fertiliser
advocates so often ignore. My experi-
ence is that organic farming gives all that
the soil has to offer, and is more econo-
mical ; added super, shows no additional
benefit except as initially helping to build
up a worth-while pasture to plough-in.
Yard-building.
“Atlanta”: Plan yards on paper before
building, and make adequate provision
for handling larger numbers of stock than
may be worked at present. Correct
arrangement of gates, with openings as
directly in line as possible, will greatly
help yarding. For sheepyards split iron-
bark or sandalwood posts are best, with
split pine in heavier ground. Round
cypress pine, ironbark, brigalow or mulga
rails all last well. Leaving the bark on
pine rails will lengthen life as the wood
is allowed to season before the bark falls.
If available it pays to use big pine, averag-
ing 8-10 in., with four rails to the panel.
Picket fences of pine or sandalwood
stakes with a rail on top are popular.
Iron gates are relatively cheap and,
properly swung and cared for, they’ll last
a lifetime. It’s a sound investment to
water the sheepyards ; wool and buildings
are kept free of dust.
Split or round ironbark or pine rails
make a strong cattleyard, but split sheoak
kept off the ground has lasted upwards
of 40 years. Rail-ends should be mor-
tised in heavy ironbark, river-gum or pine
posts sunk 3ft. to 4ft. in the ground.
High gate-posts are secured on top by a
heavy stay. A branding race will save
hours of work, and if many cattle are
handled it pays to have an iron, brick or
concrete furnace conveniently situated for
heating brands. Where stock may be
transported by float to market, a loading
ramp with railed sides built up with earth
is indispensable.
Codim Moth.
“Mr.”: C. W. Gayford, a Vic. horti-
cultural instructor, urges vigorous control
measures in spring. The extent of infec-
tion isn’t always apparent early in the
season because the small infected fruits
drop from the trees, giving the impression
that the attack has been light. Main points
for successful control are: Make the
mixture effective —no weaker than 31b.
lead arsenate powder or 61b. paste to
lOOgal. water, with half a gal. white oil
emulsion added. Spray at least once every
three weeks from petal-fall and while the
fruit remains on the tree, and cover the
fruit completely with the spray. To do
this it may be necessary to thin some
of the bunches. As a subsidiary measure
bandage the trunks of the trees with
pieces of hessian, but first clean off any
loose bark which provides alternative
cover for the grubs. The bandages should
be in place not later than the end of
November and examined every week or
10 days.
The Hotbed.
“Agro”: A hotbed on the farm is
valuable for raising seedlings and strik-
ing cuttings. Dig a trench 3ft. deep by,
say, 6ft. long, running north and south.
Fill this with fresh stable manure, leaving
it lie for a week or two and turning it
over a few times. Now build a low

If raising seedlings sow the seeds in
shallow wooden boxes filled with soil
and well drained with straw or the like
at the bottom. Place these on the
manure. The heat of this, together with
the magnified heat of the glass, will en-
sure quick germination and growth.
If cuttings are to be propagated they
should be placed in a flowerpot con-
taining sharp sand. The pot in turn is
planted in the manure. With plenty of
moisture cuttings of shrubs and trees
can be propagated very successfully this
way. The hotbed, of course, is not re-
quired in summer, except in an excep-
tionally cold district.
Staircase for the Wind.
“Mac”: There’s money in trees, but
the best way to get it is to leave the trees
where they are. Plant them where they’re
going to be some use as they grow. Use
them to stabilise slopes, control creek
banks, stop erosion and as wind-breaks —
especially as wind-breaks. In low-rain-
fall areas there is more topsoil lost by
wind erosion than by any other means—
it is ruining the dry lands and the farmers
trying to scratch a living there.
In building a wind-break, make a stair-
case for the wind. If you merely put a
wall of trees at right angles to the pre-
vailing wind the soil will be sucked up
in the lee of it. Have a fairly wide wind-
break. The first zone should consist of
tough low scrub, in the next zone low
trees suited to the average rainfall, and
behind them the high trees which are the
backbone of the wind-break. Repeat the
design downwards on the other side.
Thus the wind is deflected upwards
and a dead-air area is formed in front of
the wind-break. The updraft has been
detected as high as half a mile above the
trees. No soil is lifted in the lee because
of the slope down in the rear of the wind-
break. I’ve seen dozens of them in the
Dust Bowl of the U.SA.
Hints for the Farm.
“E. 2”: Undue strain is put on cows
through lime deficiency, and this may be
more noticeable in districts where heavy
topdressing with super, is practised. The
increased pasturage carries approximately
the same lime content an acre as the un-
treated. Best to be on the safe side and
see that Strawb gets hers from a lick
having 20 to 50 per cent, ground lime-
stone with salt.
“F.W.L.”: Muddy cowyards are a
source of extra work, much discomfort
and insanitary conditions. The yard
should have a solid floor of stone or con-
crete and slope gently from the bails.
Too often there’s a morass outside the
yard where the cows foregather, but a
raised gravel formation will provide a
track —fenced off as a lane for preference.
“Big Billy”: Where rubber separator
rings are unobtainable, the following
stitute will do. Splice a leather boot*
lace the size of the bowl, stick with
cellulose cement and press in a vyce.
“C.A.A.”: Only type of disinfectant
recommended by the S.A. Agriculture
Department for use in cow bails is one
which liberates free chlorine. Chlorine
is a gas with very powerful germ-killing
properties, provided all grease and
organic matter, such as milk, are first
removed by means of a soda solution.
Although chloride of lime gives off free
chlorine, its use in the ordinary com-
mercial form is not advised as it is not
sufficiently stable, i.e., its percentage of
free chlorine alters rapidly with exposure
to air, sunlight and storage. Therefore,
use stabilised proprietary lines in the
dilutions directed by the manufacturers.
“Plane Creek”: We sow vegetable seed
thinly at all times in N.Q., but immedi-
ately the seedlings show the second pair
of leaves most of ’em are pricked off into
larger beds where with three inches of
space each way they are able to develop
sturdy roots. Cabbages, kohlrabi, swedes
and tomatoes thrive on this treat-
ment and transplant all the better for it.
We’ve never tried trimming vegie taproots
(it wouldn’t do with long red beet), but
shortening the leaves of transplanted
seedlings causes them to take root
quicker.
“Bill C.”: Everyone knows of lucerne’s
fondnesk for superphosphate, but it is
often overlooked that all other legumes
have a similar liking. For example, on
parts of the Queensland coast, cane-
farmers recently received a warning that
the unsatisfactory returns from green
manuring crops might be the result of soil
phosphate deficiency. Red volcanic soils
are often lacking in phosphates. Now
that nitrogen-fixing bacteria are in the
public eye it is the fashion to attribute
every legume crop failure to their
absence. Actually, a legume crop can
succeed admirably without their help,
provided the soil contains a fair amount
of nitrogen.
“Myrrhee”: To control fowl lice use
a quarter pint lysol in 3gal. warm water
in a 4gal. tin —temperature of the whole
being slightly warmer than bloodheat.
Hold the birds by the wings and lower
all except the head into the solution,
working the liquid quickly through the
feathers by rubbing them up the wrong
way. This takes about five seconds. Then
immerse the head for about a second,
wipe the bird down and squeeze the
feathers to remove excess liquid. Treat
early in the day in good weather to give
the birds time to dry out. A further dip
in from Id to 12, days is necessary' to
destroy lice hatched after the first treat-
ment.

The horseman off a coin, escaping the

Against the sun’s vanes, by the gloom

Unable to slay that giant mill, unseated
Through his blindness, yet quite unde-

On, on he rolled, until the world fell flat.
With metal ringing in his ears and that
Spinning of the head from blows

Long after pain has passed. But, calm

With giants of old ideologies;

BOWS
AND ARROWS
By J. H. M. Abbott
IF you go to the Australian Museum in
Sydney, to its counterpart in Mel-
bourne or to London’s British
Museum you will find many show-
cases filled with the warlike arms of the
inhabitants of the Western Pacific —the
Melanesians. Grim and singular lethal
weapons they mostly are, and, of them
all, perhaps the most interesting are the
six-feet bows with the grisly arrows that
furnish their ammunition. The average
man would much prefer having daylight
let into him by a bullet rather than by
one of these fearful implements of death.
The bow is almost universally used in
Melanesia, but it is not in all places the
principal weapon employed in waging
war. Some of the islands in the group —
Florida, Guadalcanal, Ysabel, San Cristo-
val and parts of Malaita —favor the spear
instead. Shields are largely used as a
means of protection against the thrown
spear, but in San Cristoval a long, curved
glaive is a substitute for them.
The spears are generally made of palm-
wood, and are barbed in a fashion that
must make a terrible wound when they
are fairly driven home. In Florida they
are tipped with human thigh-bones cut
into fearful jagged points. However, open
fighting isn’t usually productive of heavy
casualties. It is when an unready village
is attacked or a small party ambushed in
the jungle that the bloodiest killing is
done. Slings are sometimes made use
of, and are supposed to have been first
adopted in attacking dwellings in trees.
Clubs are used everywhere.
The British Museum’s ethnological
gallery contains probably the best collec-
tion of Melanesian weapons in the world,
but the leading Australian galleries are
also well stocked with them.
Years ago, in an ancient hostelry in a
north of England town, the writer was
astonished to come across a mixed col-
lection of Melanesian weapons and canoe
paddles of which no one about the place
had any idea as to the origin. They were
undoubtedly very old, and it was queer
to see these specimens of South Sea
armory in that old inn, which dated back
to Tudor times. Queer and a little dis-
quieting—for they revived a sort of rest-
less hankering after the sight of reef and
palm, beach and lagoon, and the softly
warm tropic atmosphere that always
lingers in the memory of anyone who
has ever been in the South Sea islands.
But the most interesting weapon of the
Melanesian aboriginal is the poisoned
arrow. They are readily recognised in
any collection from their appearance.
They are long, slim reed-shafts, with a
" foreshaft of hardwood tipped with six
to eight inches of human bone, which is
smeared with some dark pigment. If the
tips are provided with small guards you
may be quite certain that they are
genuine, and will do well to be extremely
careful in' handling the sharp points.
Usually the traders and white inhabi-
tants of Melanesia believe that the
natives’ arrows in certain localities really
are poisoned, in the way that we use the
word, but this is not correct. Careful
scientific examination has proved that the
supposedly poisonous matter with which
the arrow-heads are smeared is not really
such, and that whatever fatalities may
occur from injuries inflicted by them are
owing, not so much to poison, but either
to the nature of the wound itself or to
tetanus due to the bone hasp, septic, cli-
matic or other causes.
In the estimation of the local natives
the arrows are undoubtedly very poison-
ous —but it is for quite another reason.
Once more the question of mana is in-
volved. What the native believes, when
manufacturing his arrows, is that the
weapon is endowed with a sort of super-
natural power by the wood-from which
it is made and from qualities conferred
upon it by charms and magic.
“The point is of a dead man’s bone,"
says an authority, “and has, therefore.
mana ; it has been tied on with powerful
mana charms. That is what they mean
by what we, not they, call poisoned
arrows. And, when the wound has been
given, its fatal effect is to be aided anc
carried on by the same magic that has
given supernatural power to the weapon.’
The so-called “poisoned” arrows are used
in the New Hebrides, the Solomons.
Santa Cruz and the Banks Islands, and
the same notions about mana being the
fatal endowment of the weapon are com-
mon to each and all of these groups. The
most toxic thing about the arrows is the
magic deadliness which their mana gives
to themj

Horseplay.
“A horse tried to join a dinner-party at a
private house in Northampton (England).’
—“Daily Telegraph.
This recalls the occasion when a horse
came to dinner during the third day of
my great-uncle Abednezar’s centenary
celebrations.
It was a gaunt, unsophisticated horse,
with kind eyes and an elongated expres-
“Hey! You re not on the paper run now!”
sion. It came into the room just as my
great-uncle was drinking soup, which was
probably why no one noticed it until it
had occupied the seat of an elderly cousin
who had just fallen in a stupor under
the table. The cousin’s wife, even then,
addressed some remarks to it under the
impression that her husband had merely
gone down to retrieve a segment of par-
snip.
Although Abednezar could not recall
having invited a horse to his party,
he was in no mood to be fussy with so
many odd relations about. He quickly
restrained a high-spirited nephew, who
had once been cashiered from the Hus-
sars, from riding the animal up and
down the table. A guest, my great-uncle
pointed out sternly, was a guest, however
equine.
The horse cheered up after a plate of
minestrone and a glass of vintage claret,
but seemed embarrassed at the difficulty
of taking soup from a plate. This was
remedied by the arrival of a wash-
trough. A gluttonous great-nephew was
dissuaded from asking for a similar help-
ing,
A series of varied wines soon had the
horse in a state of joviality, and the rela-
tions had a busy time dodging slaps on
the back. All this ended, however, when
the main course, roast beef, arrived. The
horse paled visibly, gazed in horror at the
joint and bolted madly from the room.
This was one of the reasons why my
great-uncle Abednezar changed his
butcher.

Whistling Through the Cemetery.
“Senator Ashley had to wait 35 minutes at
Toowong (Q.) before six people turned up
for his meeting. Later it swelled to 17. ‘The
small attendance,’ the Senator said afterwards,
‘is a heartening indication that the people are
satisfied with the present Government.’ ”
“Yes,” the P.M.G. said. “I couldn’t
’ve ’ad a better haudience. Not many,
mind ya, but after all, as I always says,
it’s quality not quantity that counts. And
the remarks they passed showed clearly
they were a hundred, a thousand per cent,
behind me an’ the Guvverment. For in-
stance, one bloke roared out that I didn’t

Now, if he’d a meant it to be nasty ’e’d

to the platform. What a splendid gesture
of friendliness to the party, and a sign of
complete agreement with my inlmigration
policy—after all, had he intended hostility
he would surely have hurled up a long-
defunct fish or a rat. Another fellow
sang out: ‘You’re callow, right enough!’
I can’t tell you how pleased I was at that.
When you come to think of it, chaps
named Johnson become ‘Johnno’ to
their intimates, Simpson ‘Simmo,’ and so
on. That clipping of my name I took as
a mark of great affection for me person-
ally and also a sign of approval of what
the Government has achieved. What
about you, Deddie?”
“Ah had sax at ma last meetin’, ye
ken,” quoth the Pink Icing King. “Mon,
it was a gr-r-rand audience, better even
than I would ha’e had in Sauchihall-
street, Glasga! There wasna’ as muckle
as wan wee eenterjection throughout the
whole o’ ma speech, in which o’ coorse
Ah stressed that it was only ma prompt
an’ bold action in forbeedin’ stripes in
yon humbugs an’ lolly pigs that saved
this country from all the horrors of an
Asiatic invasion. Ah sometimes ha’e
wondered since hoo long it was after Ah’d
left the hall befoor somebody woke ’em
oop. How did you get on wi’ that last
meetin’ o’ yours, Eddie?”
“Well,” replied the Dull Boy from
Dario, “me mob of urgers turned up in
force as usual. It’s reelly wonderful, y’
know, what uninterrupted hearin’s I get
wherever I mag. I skipped all references
to taxes an’ strikes, o’ course, an’ con-
centrated for over an hour on the
cowardliness o’ the Menzies crowd in
arrangin’ to give the northern half o’ the
country to the Japs as soon as they set
foot on it. After I’d finished a bloke up
an’ arsts what’s all this talk I useter spout
in Parliament about the Brisbane JLine.
After that example of the intense interest
the electors take in me actions, I reckon
Dougherty’ll do his deposit in against me.
What about you, Frankie?”
The Wizard of Capricornia washed his
hands in air with unctuous self-satisfac-
tion. “If the behavior of the audience I
had is any indication —and I certainly
think it is,” he said, “far from dropping
my majority another few thousand as
I did during the 1943 landslide to Labor
I will finish up with a majority of around
20,000. You never saw such whole-
hearted agreement with everything I said.
Not even a sarcastic laugh when I men-
tioned that one of the first things I’d do
when I got back would be to call for
several Army reports. Yes, and when he
had bitten me for a cigarette after the
meeting finished he shook hands warmly
and wished me the best of luck. Boys,
we’re a moral to go back with more seats
than ever!”

Droughts
Land men, struggling with the
abnormal war-time conditions and post-
war disruption, were caught in a hopeless
position by the present drought. They
hadn’t an earthly chance of making ade-
quate preparation for such an emergency. .
That is the only legitimate excuse Aus-
tralia can put forward.
Given the normal Australian proportion
of wet and dry, no stock should be
allowed to die of starvation in this coun-
try. After over a century to study our
climatic conditions, conservation of water
and fodder should have reached a
standard of efficiency capable of'meeting
even the severest drought on record.
Records from the time Sturt discovered
the Darling show that dry spells occur at
intervals of several years, droughts every
five or six years, severe droughts every
10 or 11, and excessive droughts every
15 to 25 years.
The grazier can get through the dry
spell by careful manipulation of his
pasture, and through the lesser droughts
with a short relief of hand-feeding. But
the more severe and the super-droughts
can only be met by a good solid reserve
of fodder. No thoroughly reliable
method of creating this reserve has yet
been adopted in Australia. Hay is bulky
and vulnerable to plagues of mice.
Grain, although it needs vermin-proof
sheds, seems to offer the best solution.
Special assistance in the way of a loan to
build standard sheds on condition that
they, are filled as soon as possible with
fodder earmarked as a drought reserve
should be a practical scheme. Such re-
serves have been made in individual cases
and have proved the salvation of flocks
and herds.—G. A. B. (N.S.W.).
Trees or Production?
I wonder if “Atrax” (B. 4/9/’46)
thought for a moment that the site of the
Brisbane Exhibition Grounds was once
forest; that trees had to be cleared from
there to make the Exhibition possible.
The whole of the Greater Brisbane area
was once forest, and poor-quality stuff
at that. In the opinions of “Atrax” and
his kind, is the country of more value
now than when it was fit only for* nest-
ing sites for birds and hollows for
’possums?
“Atrax” lauds those giant pumpkins.
Does he know forests had to be destroyed
before the farmer could get in to do his
job? He can have, the trees, or he can
have the dairy products, fat lambs and
other things which appeal to his stomach
and general welfare. He can’t have it
both ways.
His thrusts at underground water are
a stab in the dark —and a bad miss. It
has been proved repeatedly that ring-
barking has induced springs to flow which
have previously been taken by root
absorption.
Erosion? Does “Atrax” claim the
Barkly Tableland is eroding faster than
other areas? There are the Flinders
Plains, the Buchanan Plain, the Winton
Plains and others, which total well over
100,000 square miles. They never carried
trees and they never will; they don’t
average one tree to a square mile, apart
from the coolibahs on the watercourses.
Would those areas be improved if they
were forest-clad?
Personally, I love trees. Unfortunately,
or otherwise, I have to work for a living.
As a man on the land I know and appre-
ciate the value of trees. I know I can’t
grow maize or any other crop among
standing timber ; I know I can carry three
sheep on rung country where only two
could live when the timber was draining
the soil. Trees have their uses, but they’re
sadly out of place in production on com-
mercial lines. — Gidgee George (Q.).
Queensland Timbers
On the desk before me is a small piece
of freshly cut, ruby-red wood. Today,
when it was cut it caused a stir through-
out the mill, the largest in North Queens-
land.
Pieces of this kind of wood are
to be found scattered throughout
Australia in pigtroughs, dogkennels,
cowyards and in the walls and floor-
ings of old homesteads. Occasionally
one may come across an odd article of
furniture fashioned from the same timber.
N. S. Wales Railways used millions of
feet of it in rail carriages a few years
ago when it was plentiful and cheap. To-
day red cedar is rapidly becoming a
museum piece.
Red cedar is not the only wood that is
fast disappearing. The insatiable demand
for timber is denuding our best stands.
For every good sizable log that is cut
there are a dozen “poles.” Mills are send-
ing their loggers deeper and deeper into
the scrubs in search of logs because huge
stands that were easily accessible a few
years ago are now bare. The present
outlook is extremely gloomy. Maple,
once so plentiful, is now used almost ex-
clusively for veneer. Good-quality silky
oak is rare, as are good logs of bally gum,
silk wood, Putts pine and milky pine.
During the war millions of feet of
hardwoods were used by the American
Forces, who firmly believed that Queens-
land hardwoods were the best in the
world. Supplies of hickory, black
pender, cherry pender, calaphinium, red
oak, grey satin ash and white ash were
rushed by the Yanks. Southern firms
are carrying on where they left off, but
the source of supply is dwindling.
Certainly trees must be felled, logs
must be milled and houses must be built,
but nothing has been done to ensure that
this process may continue. Sawmillers are
alarmed at the position, but say they can
do nothing about it. The loggers says,
“It’s not our pigeon.” The Government
says nothing. It is, however, somebody’s
pigeon, and something will have to be
done about it before a piece of any timber
qualifies as a museum exhibit. — Cadaagi
(Q-).
No-housing
On the day after discharge I ap-
proached the Housing Commission and
filled in the standard application for
tenancy form. I was told that my case
would be investigated.
During the next four months I man-
aged to find temporary accommodation
for myself and family. Several calls at
the Housing Commission during that
time failed to produce any result in the
form of an investigator. Then, by acci-
dent, I discovered an old army cobber
and got an introduction to a higher-up.
Next day the investigator arrived and the
wife gave our history all over again.
Hope ran high on the assurance of
speedy treatment, but another month has
since elapsed, and repeated inquiries are
only answered with “Your papers are be-
fore the committee,”
It’s just five months now since the
original application and I still haven’t
even been advised whether I’m in a ballot
or not. — Fedup (N.S.W.).
M.T. Maintenance
My ’35 model continues running as long
as my petrol lasts and I keep up water
and oil levels. I grease it about every
10,000 miles and change oil once a year,
yet it gives me more trouble-free service
than most of the maintenanced-to-death
vehicles I drove while in the Army.
Standing orders stressed the import-
ance of maintenance to the point where
Army business could not be carried on
until due servicing had been done. With
greasing every 1000 miles, oil changes at
2000, and so on, trucks spent as much
time being maintenanced as they did on
the road. Time wasn’t the only thing
wasted, either —the amount of oil and
kerosene used on weekly washings of
springs and chassis would have relieved
shortages on the home front to no small
extent.
Regulations concerning the various
grades of oil to be used were, like tyre
pressures, always changing. New vehicles
straight from the manufacturer would be
drained of oils and greases, and refilled
with whatever grades were in standing
orders at the moment —the inference be-
ing that the Army knew more about lubri-
cation than the designers.
The Army could have saved a lot of oil,
grease and time by cutting maintenance
in half. It would not have impaired effi-
ciency—B. B. (N.S.W.).
Permanent Army
To a large percentage of men in it,
the Army is merely a “stopgap” ; they are
only temporary soldiefs: the Army is not
their life work. This is true of thousands
in the Occupation Force. Some joined in
a spirit of adventure or to see the world,
others decided to soldier on for a time
while conditions in Australia returned to
normal, others are waiting until land is
ready for soldier-settlement.
Many men had wise and responsible
reasons for carrying on in the Army, and
many are doing their part in a fair way.
But the man who regards the Army
. merely as a stopgap cannot have the same
interest in his job as the permanent
soldier. The man who has selected the
Army as his career and life work will
look after his record, will study and work
for advancement and become a contented
and efficient soldier. Above ail, he will
be a man with the incentive of a purpose
and a place in life.
Terms and conditions of service in the
Permanent Army should be advertised and
the conditions should be good enough
to attract sound young men. It would
be reasonable to expect a higher standard
of efficiency and discipline if permanent
soldiers were selected with something of
the discrimination which the Navy exer-
cises.— M. R. C. (8.C.0.F., Japan).
Who’ll Bell the Cat?
The necessity of sex education (B.
4/9/’46) is much more widely recognised
now than it was a generation ago, but
who’ll bell the cat? Even those who are
willing to undertake the job are not al-
ways capable of carrying it out. So
‘Now take it nicely this time... Don't snap!”
parents, mistrustful of their own powers,
leave the whole matter to the schools; and
the schools (with few exceptions) deny
responsibility. So the thing is left to the
churches, which are not keen on the job,
or to those public educators in the pub-
lishing world whose influence is so wide
that they must tread very warily or avoid
the subject altogether.
I can’t see much prospect of real im-
provement in sex education until all of
these educators realise their responsibility
and try to do their job. Parents have
the first opportunity—in pre-school years
—and their influence continues in most
cases until adolescence is over. Clearly,
theirs is the main job.
Next, the teachers. They should not be
expected to break unploughed ground in
this matter, any more than they should
be expected to teach their pupils to put
on their clothes or to eat their meals.
Sex teaching in schools should be part
of general physiological training, and the
teachers should themselves be fully
trained if they are expected to teach this
subject.
Then the public educators—press,
churches and radio —should all realise
that they have some limited responsibility
in this field. Unless each makes some
attempt to build up a healthy attitude to
sex, young Australians will grow up with
patchy knowledge and a perverted out-
look on this and other aspects of life. —
Wusslean (Vic.).
“Advocates”
“Where did you study law?” the cor-
respondent asked the prosecutor in a
Yugoslav court. “I didn’t,” said “the
prosecutor.” “I’m a surveyor by trade.”
(Uncabled Additions, B. 4/9/’46).
If the correspondent asked the same
question of an “advocate” in one of our
Fair Rents Courts, constituted under
Landlord and Tenant regulations, he
would receive the same reply, or perhaps
“agent,” “debt collector,” “auctioneer”
or even “dog trainer” —anything in fact
except “lawyer,” these courts being barred
to men trained in the study of the law.
“Saving the tenant expense” is the ex-
cuse, though it is notorious that agents
specialising in this type of business charge
higher fees than a solicitor would charge
for the same work.
The Industrial Court is also barred to
lawyers unless the opposing party con-
sents to their appearance.
Strangely enough, the very politicians
who bar lawyers from these courts
always take good care to provide them-
selves with the cream of the Bar when
engaged in litigation of their own. — Sol
Brass (Q.).
Our Future Scientists
Knight David Rivett, deputy-chairman
of the Australian C.5.1.R., is reported to
have said that the Empire is faced with a
lack of scientific leaders. In fact, so great
is the shortage that serious considera-
tion must be given to filling senior
Empire posts with enemy scientists, be-
cause they are apparently the only living
people with the necessary ability.
This shortage of scientists has been
obvious for many years, but it is more
statistical than real. The men with
trained minds, capable of handling
scientific problems, are in the Empire, but
their knowledge may have been diverted
to other channels.
It should be obvious that the man with
a trained mind will be able to do a better
job in almost any capacity than one who
is not so fortunate. In spite of the
popular press’s depiction of scientists as
slightly cracked individuals, they are
generally worldly wise and very human.
Making a sound appreciation of what
they want from life, many of them
realise that to remain pure scientists
means that they will be
unable adequately to pro-
vide for their wives and
children. So they change
readily to a more lucra-
tive method of earning
a living.
To cite an example
from the last war. A
man who did excellent
work countering tropical
deterioration of Army
equipment had originally
trained as a chemist.
After qualification he
entered industry and did
brilliant work for his
company. There was,
however, only a very
limited future in purely
scientific work, so he
transferred to an adminis-
trative post in which he
was equally successful.
It was only by accident
that the Army discovered
he was a capable chemist
—his enlistment record
showed him as a de-
partmental manager.
It is probably impossible today to bring
these lost scientists back to pure science
again, and in any case most of them
would now be incapable of filling an im-
portant research appointment.
There is only one solution —making
science as attractive as the non-scientific
callings. In our social system this means
paying pure scientists salaries as high as
those paid to administrative employees.
When politicians recognised. the value of
pure science as a war-winning weapon,
the international race started. The result
was the Empire, 1 ; U.S.A., 2 ; Germany,
3 ; Russia, 4.
Towards the end of David Rivett’s
review came this statement: “Men who
held important positions in German in-
dustrial research organisations have ex-
pressed the utmost eagerness to accept
even quite modest positions in Australia,”
No doubt Goring would also be delighted
to come here on a small salary to organise
aero clubs. What real difference is there
between the man who dropped the bombs
and the man who made them? — Screw-
ball (W.A.).
Call of the Land
I agree with “Sol Brass” (B. 21/8/ ’46)
that love of the soil keeps the majority
of farmers on the land. Right, too, is his
claim that in Australia the land does not
pay a decent \Vage to the small man.
After the last war, soldiers were settled
on small holdings and before long the un-
suited walked off, while others, taking
day wages, earned enough outside money
to hold and add to their prized posses-
sions. I know of two brothers who, at
an age when most men retire on a pen-
sion, still turn out at all hours to attend
a sick beast or stalk a pest.
“Why should they have so much land,
and others none?” is a common question,
and the answer is “Because through long
lives of hardship and toil these lovers
of the soil have fought their way through
heart-breaking setbacks to success.”
The Government can settle men on the
land at enormous cost. It can provide
houses, machinery, social amenities and
long-term credits. But it cannot provide
the greatest factor for success —an innate
love of the soil. —C. E. (Vic.).
Literary Supplements
Newspaper proprietors should consider
a “S. M. Herald” article in which
Maurice Carr discusses the enterprising
French publisher of “Les Belles Lectures
—French classics in newspaper format,
headlines and all.
There are many English classics notori-
ously hard to come by, and they could
well displace a good deal of the modern
supplements and syndicated rubbish in the
dailies. Alternatively, there is a vast accu-
mulation of books and documents dealing
with Australian history, and now out of
print, which would be eagerly read.
No doubt the Mitchell and other public
and private libraries would gladly co-
operate in supplying information and
advice to any enterprising editor.—
Obelist CTas.).


Other Days, Other Ways
I have just been examining my income-
tax assessment, and I find that I am pay-
ing the same sum per fortnight that I
formerly paid as an annual exaction. My
income hasn’t changed, but the impost
has been multiplied at least 25 times.
I can’t help wondering what the Gov-
ernment does with my money. There is
no war to finance now, and I am not
supposed to be supporting the second
army of bureaucrats which the exigencies
of war created. I can’t see that any of
my less fortunate fellows are any better
off than they were 10, 20 or 40 years ago.
A rather large number of people who
used to have to look for jobs and produce
something for the common welfare may
be better off, being civil servants who
produce nothing and get in the way of
those who want to produce something.
When I was a boy there were few civil
servants and very little social ameliora-
tion. There were no forms to be filled in,
no income tax and no Government in-
stitutions to help keep the family healthy.
My father brought up a large family in
reasonable comfort on one-fifth of what
I get We lived in a solid stone house,
had kerosene lamps instead of electric
fight and my mother cooked on a wood
stove. We were all given the conventional
education and plenty of it.
The babies didn’t come into the world
with a Government endowment. They
were delivered by the family doctor in
their own home, and they were all re-
markably healthy. They were certainly
healthier than most people seem to be
today—judging by the numbers of hos-
pitals, after-care institutions and neurosis
clinics.
The workers were at least as secure
in their jobs as they are now. They fed
as well and they lived in more comfort-
able houses. They paid very little in in-
direct taxation, beer being fourpence a
pint and cigarettes threepence a packet.
The farmers produced as good crops as
farmers do now, and there weren’t hordes
of officials supervising their operations or
agricultural committees telling them how
to do it
In those days there weren’t clouds of
professors, lecturers and departmental ex-
perts teaching the people art appreciation,
love of music, sociology, ethics and good-
ness knows what else. And there was no
Department of Information. But I have
yet to learn that the public was any less
instructed or had lower tastes or aspira-
tions than it has today.— M. G. Skipper,
247-249 Collins-street, Melbourne.
Those Employment Forms
In my salad days I was lured from a
fairly good billet for which I was well
suited by romantic visions of life on an
idyllic tropic isle. Instead of white ducks,
gin-slings and a lotos-eater’s lot, I found
drab khakis, quinine and the hard graft
of assistant at an island trading station.
For a year the boss and I sweated blood
while I learned the job.
Had that Government employment
application form which so irked
“Demos” (B. 28 / 8/’46) been in existence
then I would have been spared my first
grey hairs, and my employers the cost of
transport and inefficient labor costs. 1
would not have been hired, which would
have been better for me and the boss.
That form is but a principle of sound
“Personnel Management,” as already
practised in Australia by many large in-
dustrial concerns. Its object is to fit the
individual to the job and not the job to
the individual —which is only sound busi-
ness procedure. Possibly “Demos” will
concede that the war has awakened in
many square pegs the desire to find a
square opening.
Delay in placing applicants in jobs is
due to the time spent in finding the right
openings pick-and-shovel placement
would have been speedier for “Demos’s”
Digger, but I doubt if it would have
suited him.
Incidentally, “D.’s” mate must have
sloughed some of his Digger initiative.
Otherwise when “told to fill in a form”
he would have advised the clerk to fill the
crimson thing in himself.— Curate’s
Egg (Q.).
Whaling
“Samson” (B. 4/9/’46) needn’t be so
pessimistic about Australia being only “a
small community in the Pacific,” and as
having “taken very little interest in
whaling.” Norway, most active of all
whaling countries, has less than half the
population of Australia. Seventy years
ago, whaling was a major industry in
Tasmania, and Premier Cosgrove has
been saying it could become that again.
Australia controls a large part of the
Antarctic continent with unlimited possi-
bilities of development of its marine and
mineral resources. Douglas Mawson and
Gilbert Murray, the world’s leading
authorities on Antarctic matters, have
protested strongly against the MacArthur
decision which will give Japan authority
to make an estimated catch of 1300
whales, representing 15,000 tons of oil
and large quantities of edible meat
Prior to 1942 Japan was the world’s
greatest menace to the whaling industry.
While every other nation interested in the
matter agreed to forbid its whalers to kill
females suckling or still looking after
their young, young whales below certain
measurements and pregnant females on
their annual migration to warmer waters
for calving, Japan refused to co-operate
in any way. The Japs slaughtered every-
thing in sight, and the results of such
ruthless massacre had become clearly evi-
dent in the diminution of herds before
they launched their treacherous assault
on Pacific civilisation. Unless closely
supervised by special white officers
accompanying their factory ships, and
severely punished for any breach of the
international agreement, they will cer-
tainly repeat those offences. — Captain
Pintle (Q.).
* “The Japanese whaling fleet should be
divided among the United Nations, in-
cluding Australia and New Zealand, as
part of war reparations.” This statement
was uttered by Mr. E. Sizer, sometime
Queensland Minister for Labor and In-
dustry, on behalf of the Australian Whal-
ing Establishment
The Allies, after thrashing Japan, are
trying to restore its industry and lead its
people along correct spiritual and demo-
cratic paths—at least General MacArthur
is. But how can the Japanese be expected
to regain any kind of status while their
attempts to regain their livelihood are
crushed?
The same situation arises in Germany,
where Russia has removed whole factories
and shipyards, as well as vast quantities
of machinery, from its zone of occupa-
tion.
Both these former enemy nations are
on the verge of financial and industrial
chaos and are liabilities to such of their
conquerors* as accept Christianity and its
duties. The problem of rehabilitating
them cannot be solved by destroying the
only means they have of restoring them-
selves, and feeding themselves in the case
of the Japs.—l. A. C. (N.S.W.).
Squealers
Despite “W.K.D.’s” scorn for “squeal-
ers” (B. 4/9/’46) I have yet to hear of
any injustice or anomaly being rectified
by silence. Of war-time “squeals” he
admits that “sometimes the complaints
were genuine and rightly made public,”
yet condemns all complaining because
“often they were trifling or groundless.”
Surely the righting of one wrong justifies
a dozen complaints.
“Rehabilitation has been the main target
of the squealers.” Naturally, The
reason why “the least complaints have
come from the wounded and incapaci-
tated” should be obvious, even to
“W.K.D.” Their reliance on able-bodied
mates to make injustices public is suffi-
cient justification for all “squealing.”
It may be partly true that Australia’s
remedies are to be found in hard work
and resolution, but no amount of “collec-
tive shoulders to the wheel” can abolish
some of the unnecessary, contradictory
and even hare-brained edicts which pour
forth from Authority. An example is the
recent increased release of meat to
butchers, which coincided with a warning
that on no account must the public he
supplied above coupon value—presum-
ably each butcher is expected to feed the
extra to the dogs of the district. There
are scores of such cases, and neither
energy nor suffering in silence will right
them.
If, as “W.K.D,” says, this constant
screaming against anomalies is “sympto-
matic of the change that has come over
Australian character,” then it’s a change
for the better. — Bondi Beachcomber
(N.S.W.).
Prize Books
It is heartening to see that the 1946
S. H. Prior Prize winner, Brian James’s
Cookabundy Bridge, is priced at 7s. 6d.
I haven’t seen the finished product, but
if the publishers have done anything like
justice to it the book should be an all-
time bargain.
Over the last 10 years serious writing
in Australia has come into its own and,
with the consequent increase in local
interest, publishers are in an excellent
position to give Australian writing the
commercial fillip it needs. If they
can turn out books equal to over-
seas volumes and keep the price two or
three shillings lower, we should never
have to fear outside competition.
There is a large group of “impartial”
bookbuyers who, although they admit
that Australian writing is “all right,” in-*
variably choose the better-looking over-
seas book. These people must he cap-
tured for the Australian market, and the
way to do it is with good binding, dust-
jackets and so forth, and a saving of two
or three shillings on each book.
Advertising should also play a bigger
part and we could do worse than to look
to America for example. A “book of
the month,” or any similarly accredited
work, is given a nation-wide advertising
campaign in the U.S.A. —and that’s how
they become best-sellers. — Ad Rem
(Vic.).
In the Slums
In reply to Eve Merritt (B. 31/7/’46),
who says that abolition of slums
would tend to wipe out “larrikin-
ism and thuggery,” I rise to state that for
24 years my family lived in one of the
worst slums near Melbourne —Sandridge
(later Port Melbourne).
Nor were we numbered among the
“privileged” families. Quite the reverse.
There was no unemployment, but prac-
tically universal poverty. Wages were
low, and drink the greatest curse. Yet
there was little larrikinism, and no crime.
For a population of 3000 we had six
policemen, and their work was mainly
keeping paternal eyes on the customers
of the many pubs.
In 24 years I knew three youngsters
“go to the pack.” All three were of
“privileged” families, with no lack of
means. One was shot dead in the act of
burglary ; the other two simply grew into
worthless wasters.
From every point of view, slums should
be wiped out, but such easy and sweep-
ing generalisations as those of Miss Mer-
ritt can do nothing but injure a wholly
justifiable crusade.
As for poverty causing crime, it is
notorious that the recent increase in dis-
honesty has coincided with a far greater
apparent prosperity than Australia has
ever known.—H. E. B. (Vic.).
T.B. Treatment
A scheme is now operating in Britain
whereby all men and women who de-
veloped tuberculosis while serving with
the British Army and the A.T.S. are to
receive special treatment at selected
sanatoriums in South Africa.
Already 600 have begun the course
and it is hoped to extend treatment to
sufferers from the R.A.F., R.N. and Fleet
Air Arm.
Despite an estimated cost of several
hundred pounds per patient, and the fact
that full pay and allowances are given
during periods of treatment and con-
valescence, medical authorities claim that
the plan will be cheaper than that which
followed the 1914-18 war, when soldiers
were discharged and given full pensions
for tubercular disabilities.
As a lead in social services the scheme
is a welcome change from the expensive
and easily arranged “hand-out” policies.

From the N.E.I.
A letter from a Dutch doctor to his
sister-in-law (English) in Sydney:
I am in charge of a native hospital in the
Celebes. The Japs brought thousands of
Javanese coolies here to work for them. At
the liberation they were in camps of 9000 and
in very bad condition, dying by the score.
Now we have fitted up a lunatic asylum as a
hospital, and have 900 seriously ill patients.
Everything is very primitive—no beds, sheets,
blankets or clothes —but we are slowly making
improvements. The natives have practically no
clothes left, and await stocks from Australia.
You can get a few things on the blackmarket,
but what coolie could pay £5 for a pair of
shorts? They come to the hospital in their
“Y’ cant blame ’im fr leavin' 'er , mind—she done nothin to make
’erself attractive
fora and dirty loincloths, and have to be
attended like that. Attempts at hygiene are
foredoomed, especially with so much scurvy
about. But where there were a dozen deaths
a day, now there are only two or three a week.
It is our sincere belief that 90 p.c. of the
natives are better off under our rule than under
the direction of their own people. After all,
nobody knows the will, of the whole people.
A small armed group cries out for a republic
and anyone who openly disagrees with it is
shot. And they call thaf giving every people
the freedom to manage its own affairs! Why,
in Java and Sumatra, it is just a case of a
handful of hotheaded youths, 16 to 20 years
old, dominating the masses. They act as if
the so-called Indonesian Government were the
true representatives of the people. And the
longer they go on talking, the greater becomes
the chaos. Drs. Amir and Mansoer, who sought
refuge in a Dutch camp after working along-
side a Republican Governor, say that only
Dutch rule can save Sumatra from its present
chaos.
As soon as the war ended there were un-
pleasant happenings here. The extremists
murdered many of the Ambonese (the most
loyal group of Indonesian Christians) and
plundered hbuses and factories. The Dutch
were not allowed to have weapons or to guard
the factories, so everything was stolen and
destroyed. Now no factories will be able to
work until machines come from America.
In the meantime 30,000 women and children
are still imprisoned under the extremists. Must
they die?
This week I was talking to a visiting press
correspondent, a nice chap, but one who knew
nothing whatever about our Indies. Soon he
will go to Batavia and dine with Sjahrir and
Soekarno. Then he will write that they are line
people, and he cannot understand why such
people can’t be allowed to rule instead of
“those reactionary Dutch.” Not understanding
the situation, foreign reporters are inclined to
think that it is all similar to what you have,
say, in Australia, but you might as well com-
pare the Middle Ages with modern times.
We should like to see Britain (always the
champion of fair play) helping small countries
like Holland as much in peace-time as it does
in time of war. Britain, more than any other
country, should understand colonial problems.
British troops were allowed To keep order in
Indo-China, but not here. Neither are our own
Dutch soldiers, so you can imagine how bitter
we feel. We must see women and children mur-
dered and unavenged.
We are not conservative. We understand very
well that every people has a right to its own
life. But it must be the will of the whole
people that is carried out, not that of a small
group, half intellectuals and half louts, forc-
ing weapons into the hands of others. I am
quite certain that most of the native peoples
prefer our rule to that of their own “rulers.”
For under us they bad a peaceful life with
good food and care and no oppression. Now
we have a system of bureaucrats —friends giving
one another the best jobs, and not caring in
the least what happens to the common people.
They can make fine speeches, but their deeds
are not like their speeches. We see that here
every day.
That there is a difference between East and
West can be seen very clearly in the capacity
for work. For us, work is a pleasure, but for
them a trouble. They are not active, and
won’t be for many decades.
Forgive my outburst, but tears are not far
from our eyes when we see all our work un-
done and our British allies helpless.
—G. I. S. (N.S.W.).
The Farmer’s Tax
“Don’t forget the cheques for cream,
eggs, pigs, etc,, which the farmer cashes
at the store and does not include in his
income-tax return,” says “Adam” (B.
4/9/’46).
Lest any farmer-reader should be
so gullible as to believe that the Com-
missioner of Taxation can be hoodwinked
in this fashion, I hasten to warn them
that all dairy companies send annual re-
turns to the Income-Tax Department of
all payments made for cream supplied.
If the farmer’s return does not correspond
with the company’s return, he receives a
“please explain,” and in default of reason-
able explanation additional tax is imposed
for non-disclosure of income.
Bacon companies also make similar
yearly returns, and no doubt the Egg
Board does the same.
Farmers may receive a lot of misplaced
sympathy, but tax evasion is not one of
their privileges. That privilege belongs to
racketeers and blackmarketeers. — Junius
Jr. (Q ).
Petrol Rationing
Petrol rationing in Australia is saving
four million gallons a year, and, although
that sounds a lot, it isn’t much when
considered against the 350,000,000 gal-
lons Australia was using annually be-
fore the war.
Actually, it means that rationing is
saving us four days’ supply, while the
Liquid Fuel Board costs us £250,000.
That £250,000 would buy 6,000,000 gal-
lons of petrol at the present landed cost
of 9d. a gallon.—-C. A. (S.A.).

HE HAS LED
THE FIGHT
AGAINST LABOR FOR
LOWER TAXES FOR the PEOPLE!
In the House and in the Electorate, Arthur Fadden,
as a recognised financial expert, has never wavered in his
assurance that Australia’s post-war needs could be fully
met without crushing the life and soul out of the
community.
Now, in his policy speech, Fadden has shown
convincingly how it can be done.
The Country Party slogan for the Commonwealth’s
return to a prosperous peace-time footing is—
HALVE TAXATION - DOUBLE PRODUCTION
LABOR PAPER’S
STRIKING TRIBUTE
A striking tribute to the work of Mr. Fadden
is contained in an editorial statement in the
Bathurst “Advocate” of 11th July, 1946.
The “Advocate,” a Labor organ published in
Mr. Chifley’s home town and by a company in
which Mr. Chifley is a substantial shareholder,
says this of the Country Party Leader:—
“Mr. Fadden is one of the most attentive
members so far as his parliamentary duties are
concerned and is also one of the most enthusi-
astic workers for both his party and his elec-
torate. As a political opponent Mr. Fadden
is recognised as one of the fairest and has on
many occasions rendered valuable service to
the Government on many issues affecting
national interests and for this has earned the
respect and approbation of all parties.”
There is no royal road to the “Golden Age” except through
productive labor, and no way to productive labor except through
a tax policy which encourages work and personal initiative.
