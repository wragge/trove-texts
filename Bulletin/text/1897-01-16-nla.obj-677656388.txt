THE RED PAGE.
There exists no adequate biography of Nelson.
Southey’s is the best, chiefly because it is
most free from the patriotic bias which insists
that home-grown geese are inevitably swans; and
from the mental incapacity which attributes all-
round perfection to anyone brilliant on a single
line. There are immense numbers of people who,
because Dickens wrote successful novels, would
hear with respect his judgment on horseflesh. Or,
conversely, many valiant Australian riders are
assured of Gordon’s poetical quality because he
leaped a dangerous fence at Mount Gambier.
• * * *
But Southey’s life of Nelson is in many respects
a mere ssetch ; you have to get a picture of the
hero more from what he hints than what he states.
His style, though lucid and strong, is neither
very vehement nor very fascinating. Yet, mak-
ing allowance for the anti-Gallic feeling from
which an Englishman of Southey’s day cor.’ 1
hardly escape, his judgment is singularly good.
He may glide over Nelson’s weaknesses, but he
does not gloss them over. He omits much, but
in strong contrast to other of Nelson’s biographers
—Laughton, for example—he perverts nothing.
Southey saw that Nelson’s greatness offered
magnificent excuse for his failings and that there
was no need of special pleading to justify them.
* * » *
As Southey’s life of Nelson is the best life, so
the-new edition of it which David Hannay edits
is the best edition. The editor is able and im-
partial. Occasionally his phrases concede a trifle
to British prejudice : he is hypothetical where he
might justly be assertive: but his obeisance to
national pride is never so marked as to be servile.
Hannay’s notes and appendices condense infor-
mation only otherwise to be obtained by study of
many half - forgotten volumes. Supplementing
Southey’s story, they make that story as com-
plete as it is possible to make it. But the nature
and extent of them prove it time for a full and
philosophic life of Nelson. Southey’s musket
can be furbished into a decent weapon : it can
never be the equal of a modern rifle.
* • * *
To no man more truly than to Nelson can be
applied the word “ hero ’’—either in its ordinary
or in a more recherehb and enlightened significa-
tion. He compelled and dominated by nature :
success was an instinct with him. The flash of
his eye bred a nervous exaltation in whomsoever
it lighted on. His mere presence was thrilling.
Whether in the fleet or with the Portsmouth
populace this personal stimulus was the same.
Like Napoleon, he seemed a man apart, made for
the common herd to admire, and cherish,
and follow without judgment or hesitation. Yet
physically Nelson was almost contemptible. To-
wards the end of his career that small, shrivelled,
mutilated, weather-beaten carcase was the last
shrine one would choose for a popular idol. Intel-
lectually, outside his profession, his powers were
barely mediocre. Even in his profession he had
little more than a good seaman’s strategy, dis-
played few resources of generalship. But he could
fight, and make others fight, incomparably. It is
hardly an exaggeration to say that after the Nile
his name was worth a dozen line-of-battle ships :
so glorious was the confidence he inspired in his
own men, so signal the fear he struck into those of
the enemy. The worst of his biographers has not
failed to catch from the fire of his spirit a glow
which warms one through the dullest and most
halting pages.
But Nelson’s worshippers are rarely satisfied
with saying all this ■ they seem to think it duty
to try and wash out with weak apologies the blots
upon their hero’s scutcheon. Even the disgraces
of Naples have found bigoted defenders. Naples
was Nelson’s Oapuu. He came thither after
Abonkir, and for twenty months lay, actually or
metaphorically, in.the arms of Emma Hamilton,
a coarse, vigorous, enticing prostitute to whom
Nelson in turn prostituted his own honor and
that of the fleet which he commanded. For twenty
months he devoted his energy and employed his
vessels in propping the throne of a loutish, ignoble
tyrant, time and again disobeying the direct
orders of his superior officer to go in chase
of the hostile fleet. With a head turned by
flattery and female seductions, he was so com-
plaisant to the cruel Neapolitan queen —a sister
of Marie Antoinette, and even more superstitious
and vengeful—that he tore up a capitulation
signed by the English, Russian, and Neapolitan
representatives, and sacrificed the wretched
“rebels” against the worst government in Europe
to the worst cruelties which that government
could invent. When Cardinal Ruffo himself,
whose character was black even for a priest,
wished to keep trust with the men to whom lie on
h.-half of the Neapolitan monarch, and Captain
Foote on behalf of England, had pledged liberty
and life, it was left to Nelson to insist on a
scandalous breach of faith, and to hang at a ship’s
yard-arm, after an infamous mockery of a trial
which in any case Nelson had no right to conduct,
Admiral Garacciolo, who had served with the de-
feated party prior to the capitulation.
* * * *
Southey has said rather less about this conduct
than Nelson deserves, but the little he has said
gives reason for every undiseriminating loyalist to
denounce his incompetency. But Nelson’s actions
speak for themselves to every honest man, and
would shout his folly and barbarity if not a com-
mentator had expressed honest indignation
regarding them. It is charitable to suppose,
what no doubt approximates to the truth, that
Nelson was never quite sane after his head was
wounded at Aboukir, and on that ground, while
justly denouncing his deeds at Naples, to absolve
him as far as maybe from complete responsibility.
Harry Morant, otherwise “ The Breaker,
came out of the sun-smitten West for a Sydney
New Year, and was farewelled in this fashion by
another bright Bulletin bard—W. H. Ogilvie,
otherwise “ Glenrovvan,” who partners him_ in
horse-swapping, and droving, and verse-making,
and whatever of love and iiquor ihe gay gods
send—
I Then “The Breaker” came to Sydney and
planked all the money of his “ crowd ” on a horse
which ran second, instead of first, in the Rand-
wick Steeplechase, and “ the crowd ” went broke
gaiiy. „ „
Of all the bush poets now writing, Ogilvie in
style and capacity approaches nearest to the
lamented Boake. (Boake’s collected work, with
a memoir by A. G. Stephens, is shortly
to be published by Angus and Robertson and per-
mission of The Bulletin for the benefit of his
family.) The author of the thrilling “StoreCattle
from Nelanjie,” and other fine Bulletin verse, is a
pleasant-faced young Scotchman midway in his
twenties, who has almost acquired the air of a
bushman born. He does not brood quite so much
as Boake did, and touches hardly such deep
springs of feeling ; but he has all Boake’s rhyming
faculty and quick-pulsed sympathy. Boake,
indeed, used often to weave his lines much in the
manner with which a Quarterly Reviewer up-
braided Keats, letting the thought follow the
rhyme instead of leading it. So, for example, in
these hitherto unprinted lines —which have, alas !
a note of the personal and prophetic in them—
addressed to one who lightly said that “bush-
men cannot love.”
Where waters thread —doth bid us stay :
Our passions for a month, a week,
Flare out and then they die away—
For separation, like the creek
That stays the fire, bars the way.
You say we bushmen cannot love:
Well, have it so ! but this I swear—
That she possessed a power to move
The dullest boor to do or dare.
But I, as being somewhat shy,
Became the target for her wit . • •
How oft in wantonness she'd pit
The blazing lances of her eye
And keener rapier of her tongue,
That carelessly made lightning play,
Until to action I was stung,
And, like a dumb beast, stood at bay. ...
* * * *
Poor Boake ! shy, sensitive, a dreamer to whom
Rogers’ tine saying of Byron applies truly and
wholly— , . ,
. . . his heart, methinks,
Was generous, noble—noble in its scorn
Of all things low or littll- nothing there
Sordid or servile —
the sweet influences of sex swayed him strongly
—his heart leapt, as all bushmen’s hearts, to the
rustle of a petticoat. And then ... to end so
—a suicide at 25. But, unless it be suicide at
24, what better ending is left for the baffled
idealist ?
—4. ?
Noticing W. Garrett Border’s recently-issued
“Treasury of Hymns,” SATURDAY Review says
things which needed re-saying :
This is a collection of 1042 hymns by about 450 writers,
and is evidence enough of the immense popularity of the
religious ballad. It will excite no dismay or surprise in
most folk who behold it; and yet how surprising it really
is that religious emotion should express itself no better
than in miles of doggerel ballads. Hymns began with
the Arians; they have flourished almost in inverse pro-
portion to the health of the Church, and they have par
ticularly abounded in the decadent and unpoetic periods
of thought. Saints tike Anatolius, Clement, Ambrose,
Hilary, and Augustine are, it is true, the fathers of
hymn-writing, and both they and many writers since
have summed up their deepest feelings in lofty, severe,
and restrained verse, and some of these noble poems have
survived and been interpreted for English people by
Chandler, Neale, and others; but, unfortunately, the
vision of spiritual things, which struck great saints all
but silent in the face of great mysteries, has been denied
to the voluble and gushing grocers who now retail false
■sentiment in halting verses. If we take a single verse of
an ancient hymn and examine it by the side of a modern
verse we shall immediately discover the root reason for
the vapidness of modern jingle. Let us place together a
verse of St. Ambrose and one by Mr. Bubier: —
“ Splendor Paternse Glori® “ I would commune with
Thee, my God—
De luce lucem proferens, E’en to Thy seat, 1 come;
Lux Lucis et fons luminis, I leave my joys, I leave my
sins,
Dies diem illuminans.” And seek in Thee my
home.”
• * * *
The one author has forgotten himself. He does not
even remember that he is weary or a wastrel, or has lost
angel faces or anything of the sort: he does not descant
upon his diseases. He does not congratulate himself, like
Phoebe Cary, that he is “nearer home,” or “beat the
void ” with Eliza Scudder’s “ restless pinion,” or with
Monsell assure the Almighty that he bears Him in mind,
or with Faber wish to have no wishes left, or with the
little Halls chirrup “I'm thy little birdie,” or remind
the Holy Ghost, as the excited Mr. Bonar did, that he
needed calming, or with Mr. J. Sharp explain “I cannot
bear the thought that I may start, Away from Thee,” or
with smug Thomas Hornblower Gill sing “ My God ! I do
not flee from Thee." St. Ambrose would have regarded
it as profane to perk his personality into the inaccessible
light. There is no personal element at all in his deep and
passionate lines. We are on a lower level the moment
the personal element comes in, even when it is intro-
duced by a master singer, even when it is as delicately in-
troduced as in the fine lines “ Quaerens me sedisti lussus,”
or in Cowper’s “ Sometimes a light surprises.” In Mr.
Bubier's vulgar verses we have every imaginable hymn-
vice concentrated—impertinence, inexact use of language,
baldness, unreality, irreverence, lack of the musical sense.
It is a far cry from Heaven to Beckham, Mr. Bubier's real
home.
* * • *
No doubt there are a few hymns which are also noble
poems, and Mr. Horder has thrust into his volume, to
plump it out, some noble poems vyhieh are in no sense
hymns; hut to get a synoptical view of what is false,
mawkish, profane, and illegitimate, a modern hymnal is
the best coign of vantage. It is, indeed, an index of how
sharp-set, and how starved, the religious appetite must be
that it will endure to banquet upon such husks. The
editor of the present collection, however, is very phased
with himself, and he offers his collection hopefully and
cheerfully to the “widely-spread culture rf our day.”
If that sprawling nebulous abstraction were healthy and
well-knit it would he anything but grateful. Ilow can
any one, forsooth, but a spiritual surgeon he grateful for
a swollen parcel of religious dropsies ? If we cannot stay
I the plague ofhjmns, nt *a.t it might be reduced to a
minimum by a sever, h careful hymu;b<K,fe
pruned and pared relentlessly, and issued by the bench
bishops.

“Good-bye,- he said, and she put her hand in his. it
was held there, and she looked up. She was drawn a
little nearer, and then somehow in some soft but irre-
sistible way she found herself folded into his arms, close
against his breast, and his lips against hers. Swayed iy
some power that s-emed quite new to her and beyond
herself, she linked her arms suddenly round his neck and
kissed him back with her warm, smooth lips in a quick,
responsive, passionate fervor. All the gratitude to him
for the pleasure of that happy afternoon, all the appre-
ciation of his charm and the sense of violent attraction
towards him, found relief in that impulsive kiss. It was
not the kiss of passion, nor even love. These had not
been stirred as yet; it was rather of enthusiastic admira-
tion, as she might have bent suddenly over the page of
a book that stirred her and kissed it with vehement
delight. As he had said ‘Good-bye,’ words had been
leaping to her lips and striving in her brain- words to
tell him how she admired him, how great her pleasure
with him had been. Then suddenly in his arms, so near
his heart, there had seemed no. way to express it all hut
this no way so simple, so natural, so utterly satisfying,
so necessaiy as this, and in a pure spontaneous enthu-
siasm she let all the strength of her fervid soul rush out
upon her lips as they met his. It ran like quick fire
through the man’s whole nervous, excitable being, but
he gave no outward sign.
Query: If she had had “large, curled lips,”
like Irene, instead of merely 44 warm, smooth
ditto, would he have given any outward sign?

"VVm. Gay deserves credit for this, in his new
book of verses : —
This is ms good as Wordsworth, in Wordsworth 8

WHEN “THE BREAKER" IS BOOKED FOR THE
SOUTH.
I He will leave, when his ticket is tendered,
A bundle of debts, I'm afraid —
Accounts that were many times rendered
And bills that will never be paid ;
Whilst the tailor and riding-boot maker
Will stand with their thumbs in their mouth
With a three-cornered curse at “ The Breaker ”
When “ The Breaker ” has booked for the South !
There’s a fence at the back of Small’s stable —
Five feet—and a bristle of spikfs !
But a rider who’s willing and able
Will make the horse jump, if he lues.
They will say we are mad, or have dreamed it,
For there’s no one from Lachlan to Louth
Will cross in the dark where the cream did—
When "The Breaker” has booked for the South !
There’s a girl—when the white moonbeams glisten
And the stars shine out over the roofs—
Will stand by the railings and listen
For the beat of that cream horse’s hoofs!
Will stand by the rails and remember
The last kiss that was press’d on her mouth,
On a certain sad day in December-
On the day when “ The Breaker” went South!
There are comrades who’ll miss him at polo
And look for his hard phiz, in vain,
And it’s twenty to one that they’ll follow,
And “ shout ” for “ The Breaker ” again ;
Whilst a rest shall come after the riot,
And drinking shall lapse into drouth,
For the town will go back to its quiet—
When “ The Breaker ” has booked for the South !
You say we bushmen cannot love:
Our live* are too prosaic ; hence
We lose or lack that finer sense
That raises some lew men above
Their fellows, setting them apart
As vessels of a finer make,
The acme of the potter’s art.
Are placed apart upon the shelf:
So he is more than common delf,
And more than brute in human guise,
Who, seeking, finds his nobler self
Twin-mirrored in a woman’s e>es.
Yet these things bring their penalty :
For oft the merest touch will break
These vessels of a finer make ;
And throats attuned to noblest key
A draught of air will set awry,
And stifle in an ulcerous sore
That voice that floated to the sky,
And silence it for evermore.
You say we bushmen cannot love—
That, like our foe, the fire-fiend,
We blaze, until a river-bend—
Nay, less, a pebble-paven groove
PRIMROSES.
They shine upon my table there,
A constellation mimic sweet:
No stars in heaven could shine more fair,
Nor earth has beauty more complete ;
And on my table there they shin",
And spea>- to me of things divine.
In Heaven at 8rst they grew, and when
God could no fairer make tin m, He
Did plant them by the ways of men
For all the pure in heart to see,
That each might shine upon its stem
And be a light from Him to them.
They speak of things above iny verse,
Of thoughts no earthly language knows,
That loftiest hard could ne’er rehearse,
Nor holiest proph»t e’er disclose,
Which God Himself no other way
Than by a primrose could convey.

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-emi-
nence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Melbourne.
His name has become almost literally a household word ;
almost every other man you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed in an
acute or chronic case of long standing, where other physicians
have failed. He addresses himself in particular to cases that
have baffled the skill and science of other doctors. His name
is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he
undertakes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to your
life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best friend
and benefactor. If you are troubled with want of sleep, a
tired gloomy feeling, and loss of energy, which impair both
your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you for study,
business, or the proper enjoyment of life ; if you are suffering
from these or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before
it is everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat it
with unfailing success.
MIDDLE-AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching back
and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and vigor,
and not unfrequently accompanied by an impairment of the
general health. In justice to this celebrated specialist it can
be truthfully stated that in all such cases of middle-aged
men, as .well of young men, his success has been almost
invariable. ' , " ....
Troubles of every kind, name and nature, treated far in
advance of any institution in Australia female complaints,

Having comp’eted his New and Centrally-situated
Electrical «£• Consulting Rooms
Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at
137 EHzabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
SPECIAL DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men
who suffer from any of the following symptoms,
namely : —Frequent headaches, giddiness, drowsi-
ness in the daytime, irregularity of the bowels,
feeling of fullness after eating, specks before the
eyes, halos or circles round a candle, cold hands
and feet, pains in the back or under the shoulder-
blade, tenderness of the breast-bone on pressure,
palpitation of the heart, clammy hands, an
aversion to society, a fear of something dreadful
about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, (to.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all SPECIAL DISEASES
may be quickly and permanently CURED,
without loss of time and money. This book
will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for REMEDIES
NECESSARY FOR THE CURE,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.
Dr. GIBBONS has documentary evidence of'
having thoroughly CURED Thousands of Cases
during the extended time he has practised as a
Specialist in Australia.

ODE: TO THE “SOUTHERLY BUSTER.”
Wind of the South, all hail !
Oh, wind that comest roaring' from the sea,
That comest grand and glorious, fresh and free !
All day we longed and listened for thy feet,
We drooped and sickened in the stifling heat.
Night came. The darkness came and still no
breath,
No breeze to stir the air, and still as death !
At midnight hour from restless couch I rise
And leaning from the casement, scan the skies.
No speck, no cloud—no hope of gentle rain !
The cruel stars smile down upon our pain.
But hark ! a low, dull murmur from the South—
It comes, O drooping hearts ! O land of drouth !
The good South wind, the strong South wind up-
springs.
I feel its breath ! I hear its rushing wings !
And louder still, and plainer and more plain,
The breeze blows in upon my burning brain.
Oh, roaring wind that o’er the land dost sweep,
Oh, rushing wings that bring us longed-for sleep,
Blow on, blow swift and strong, blow peace and
rest
To weary thousands, faint and heat-oppressed,
Who list with joy the fury of the gale,
Who rise up in the night and cry, “ All hail! ”
Wind of the South, all hail!

SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1897.
The Past Year’s Boom
The Westralian boom has got to the end of
another year of its existence, and it is still
alive, though there are signs that it is getting
near to the brink of disaster. Many outside
circumstances have combined to keep the
boom afloat so long. Money in England has
of late been cheap and very abundant, while
promising investments have been scarce,
therefore unpromising ones have had a better
chance than usual. Gold has always a
fascination for the speculator, and Aus-
tralia’s past repute as a gold-producer helped
the boom along. To J. Bull, Westralia
was a field that was green by reason of its
remoteness, just as Paraguay looked to
Lane’s pilgrims like a land of extraordinary
verdure. The fact that a very large
proportion of the scanty gold-output was
obtained in three immense masses from
Bayley’s Reward, the disastrous Lon-
donderry and the Great Boulder added
a beautiful glamour to a total which
was comparatively small in mere ounces,
and which, if it had been a little more
evenly divided among the mines actually
working, would have looked very poor
and barren. Also, the British boomer
loves big things to float and boodle and lie
about, and Westralia, with its 975,000 square
miles of territory, mostly empty and with
their possibilities not exploded by too much
exploration, was a splendid field for romance.
The province came to the front, too, just
when the great Rand boom had revived the
faith of the stolid Briton in big gold dis-
coveries, and when the men who grabbed
too late at the South African fields were
eager to grab in good time at the next
chance which came along. Therefore, as the
natural consequence, they grabbed altogether
too soon, and Westralia got the benefit of
their mistake. All these and other circum-
stances helped to make W.A. the great
bubble land it has been. But though the
arrival of the boqm can be fully accounted
for, its continuance, considering the great
scarcity of solid results, remains a good deal
of a mystery.
* * * *
Westralia lives, to all intents and pur-
poses, on gold alone —or, to be more accu-
rate, it booms on gold alone. For 1896 its
yield was about 281,2630 z. ; the figures may
not be absolutely accurate, but that is the
official record at time of writing. In 1892
the yield was 59,5000 z. In 1893 it was
110,800 oz. ; in ’94, 207,0000 z. ; and in ’95,
231,0000 z. Consequently, this year there is a
reported increase of 50,0000 z., equal to an im-
provement of £189,000. This would be a
good increase in any country that wasn’t
staggering under so stupendous a load of
British capital, but even if the gold-yield
was all profit it wouldn’t pay quite ljj per
cent, on the capital of the various mining
companies, and even the reconstructed Colo-
nial Bank pays 2| per cent, to its very much
fixed depositors. Moreover, the Colonial
Bank pays back the principal when the
transaction is closed ; a mine never does.
When its business is finished there is no-
thing left to represent the capital save a hole
in the ground and a small amount of old
machinery, which is either abandoned as not
worth removing or sold for a fraction of its
original cost. Therefore, it certainly is not
the dividends, so far as they have gone,
which keep the Westralian boom alive. If
1| per cent, interest and no return of the
principal could make a boom, then the rush
for deposits in the Colonial Bank, where the
interest is nearly double and the principal is
returnable, would be so intense that cus-
tomers would tread each other under foot in
their struggle to get their money into the
reconstructed institution.
* * * •
Moreover, after allowing for working ex-
penses, it is more than doubtful if the Wes-
tralian goldfields, as a whole, pay any
dividend whatever. There is very solid
reason for believing that the gold actually
costs more to produce than it is worth. There
have been years when calls exceeded divi-
dends in Victoria, and Victoria produces far
more metal under conditions which make the
cost of production a great deal less. As
another curious circumstance, it may be men-
tioned that Victoria, in 1896, produced
84.000 ounces more than in 1895, so it had a
60 per cent, larger increase than Westralia.
Yet there was no aggravated boom in the
Melbourne mining market ; no great rush of
outside investors, no large influx of popula-
tion as in W.A., and, though the revenue
improved, it didn’t rise with the sensational
whoop of the western province. This seems
to show that a gold-boom and gold produc-
tion have no essential relationship to each
other ; there may be the production without
the boom or vice-versa. But the gold-boom
which is not based on solid ounces and dwt.
can’t be of an enduring character. The
Westralian mines have to pay dividends on a
capital which is probably more than four
times as great as that of the mines of Vic-
toria. To do so on the Victorian scale—
which, taking matters all round, is now a very
moderate one—the output needs to be fully
ten times what it is, provided that expenses
can be brought down to the Victorian level.
If they can’t be brought down to that level,
then the production needs to be twelve or
fifteen times as large as at present. And
when it reaches that point, of which there is no
present prospect, the only reasonable infer-
ence is that the industry willmaintain the same
steady - going position as that of Victoria,
and seeing that the latter province can’t raise
even the shadow of a gold-boom, and merely
plods along with its mineral industry in
much the same fashion as it does with its
wheat and butter and other unemotional
products, even this glorious consummation,
if it can be reached, which seems hopelessly
improbable, holds out no prospect of the
boom’s continuance.
* * * *
The present situation of Westralia is one
vast anomaly, and another especially anomal-
ous feature is shown in the public revenue.
As already mentioned, the gold-production,
in 1896, increased to the extent of £189,000
as compared with ’95. There was no notable
improvement in any other industry. Com-
paring 1890 with 1894—these being the
earliest and latest years for which the W.A.
Statistician supplies any information—and
dealing with all products except gold, the
exports show a decline in nearly every item.
Even the mysterious trade in dogs dropped
from £l5O to £2 ; fish went down from £25
to 20s. ; the total wine exports fell from £29
to £l9 ; and half-a-dozen items vanished
altogether. Yet, on the strength of this
increase of £189,000 in gold the public
revenue rose by a little over £1,000,000. It
was a great and wonderful rise—almost the
biggest in Australian history, and as a
million couldn’t come out of £189,000 the
only inference is that so many extra millions
were spent in looking for that comparatively
small sum that the Treasury managed to
pick up one of them in passing. The state
of things where the finding of £189,000 leads
to the expenditure of so much money that
the State can annex fjve times the total
visible cause of the riot is truly extraor-
dinary, and is much too glorious to last.
Either the cause must get a great deal larger
or the effect must get smaller. The Westra-
lian revenue can’t continue booming at its
present rate on so infinitesimal a basis- of
solid inducement, and unless its mineral in-
dustry looks up to a very remarkable extent,
something serious must happen.
* * * *
The Forrest Government has been run-
ning riot on the strength of this transient
prosperity. Within the last 12 months it
has committed itself, or partially committed
itself, to undertakings that will swallow
£6,000,000 or so of borrowed money. Hit
gets the money at 3 per cent, the additional
interest burden will be £lBO,OOO a year ;
and £189,000 extra extracted once out of the
province’s one big industry is a very slender
justification for a load of £lBO,OOO a year in
perpetuity. When there is hardly any
notable sign of improvement in any industry
save the precarious gold-mining business
alone, and even its improvement is nothing
very large or extraordinary, the future pro-
spects of the Westralian creditor look far
from brilliant. Yet, in the meantime,, and
despite the fact that the share-market is in
an advanced state of decomposition, and the
floating of new wild-cats is practically im-
possible, and the country is full of idle
batteries and exempted mines and liquida-
tions, the boom, so far as the State is con-
cerned, keeps up bravely. The increase of
revenue is spread over almost every depart-
ment. On the strength of the extra £189,000
of gold the railways earned £330,000 more
than in 1895, by carrying the men who
found the above amount, and the men
who didn’t find it, and by conveying
machinery to extract it, and provisions
and liquors and other things for the
people who were looking for it, or were
selling drinks and various goods to the people
who were looking for it, or were washing
their clothes, or otherwise living upon them.
And the Customs raised £380,000 more in
duties on the goods imported for the use of
the men who found that £189,000 and for
the people directly or indirectly dependent
on them. Still, though the outward pro-
sperity continues, the character of things is
changing. The excitement began as a gold-
boom. It went on as a coiiipany-floating
boom. It is now becoming largely a bor-
rowed money and public works boom, like
those of New South Wales and Victoria in
past years. It will probably last a year or
two longer in its latest capacity, and then if
something not yet apparent doesn’t come to
its assistance it must go under.
* * * *
It would be absurd, of course, to profess
that the Forrest Government was wholly
responsible for the present position of things.
No one can draw a sharp line anywhere and
say that here genuine prosperity ends and
artificial inflation begins. No one can say
exactly how far it is safe to reckon on the
boom being continuous, so as to adjust the
commitments of .the State to the permanent
condition of things as they will be when
chaos subsides and some semblance of
definiteness sets in. Any Government would
be liable to blunder at such a time. But
the Forrest Government seems to have
blundered on a Napoleonic scale, and as-
sumed, not merely that the boom would
leave some permanent prosperity behind it,
but that it was all permanent. And, as a
result, Westralia is likely to make a historic
burst by-and-bye. At present it is enjoying
nearly three times as much revenue in pro-
portion to population as any other of the
Australias, and this glory is too incredible to
last.
Some More “Horrors.”
The series of shriek articles published by
Sydney Telegraph on the Horrors of Protec-
tion as exemplified in Victoria ended in shedding
something of a blessing on that much-abused
system. This wasn’t the result which the
writer intended to convey, but it was the one
which he arrived at all the same. Among many
other things, he attacked the social aspect of
the question, and demonstrated that a high
birth and marriage rate was a reliable test of
prosperity, and also proved by figures that the
rates in both Vic. and N.S.W. were declining,
but that in the Freetrade province the decline
was much faster than in its neighbor. He
alleged that the quantity of food consumed was
another infallible index, and that the best-fed
man was the happiest and richest and wisest,
and then he showed by his own tables of
statistics that the Victorian was the better-fed
person of the two. And, having got these two
disastrous facts off his chest, the Telegraph’s
contributor seriously entered upon the hard-
cash aspect of his story. This aspect consisted
mainly of two assumptions; first, that the
amount paid in duties to the Government was
added by the importer on to the price charged
to his customers—the public—along with about
60 per cent, traders’ profit on top of the actual
outlay, so that every shilling of customs duty
levied under the nefarious system of Protection
raised prices about Is. 7d. to the consumer;
and, second, that, as a natural consequence,
prices were that much higher in a protected
than in a Foreign-trade community. Then he
dropped into figures in support of his conten-
tion, and wrecked himself horribly in one act.
* » * *
The batch of figures in support of the first
contention read as follows:
DIRECT COST OF CUSTOMS DUTIES.
(Except Duties on Intoxicants and Narcotics )
Government revenue ... ... pqoo non
Gross profits of trades thereon ... ..' 540’000
Increased price charged by protected manu- ’
facturers 2 600 000
Importers gross profit on one-half thereof *260*000
Retailers gross profit on two-thirds thereof ... 664,000
Total cost ... ... 964 000
direct cost of protection to Victoria, therefore* iq
£4,964,000 a year, and of this enormous sum only £9OO *OOO
is reaped by the Government, while over £4,000 000 goes
into the pockets of private people. oes
This alleges as clearly as it possibly can that
where the Government gets £900,000 in duties
the people pay £1,440,000 in extra prices of
imported goods, and because they pay this
£1,440,000 they also pay £3,524,000 i/extra
prices on locally-manufactured goods. And
having laid down this mass of numerals with a
grievous thud, the Telegraph’s genius pro-
ceeded with another table of figures to call liim-
self an Ananias of the most foolish description.
*** * .
The second outbreak is a list showing the
alleged prices of various articles of food liu
Sydney under the blessings of Foreign-trade
and in Melbourne under the especial curse of
Protection. Taking the food aspect only, and
leavincr out some facts about white and gold
china "which makes the table run to more space
than is available, the document is as follows
This list, as a means of proving how the
average toiler suffers under Protection, is fool-
ishly incomplete. It says nothing at all about
mutton, beef, pork, sugar, tea, coffee, eggs,
fruit, cabbages, turnips, carrots, salt, locally-
made jams, and various other articles, which
make up the biggest part of the average work-
man’s food-expenditure. (In another part of
the statement, however, it appears that the
standard price of bread sold over the counter is
the same in both cities, and that potatoes are a
trifle cheaper in Melbourne.) Therefore, it is a
reasonable assumption that a lot of the above
articles are as cheap, or cheaper, in the southern
city, and it was therefore considered advisable
to leave them out as calculated to spoil the
argument. This, however, is all a side issue.
* * * *
The soulful aspect, of the case is that the
Telegraph’s list utterly demolishes its own
figures, and proves its statement about the cost
of Protection to be a foolish, clumsy fabrication.
Said statement reads that the £900,000 paid in
duties is passed on to the people along with
=£540,000 traders’ profits thereon ; in other
words, that every shilling duty costs the people
about Is. 7d. in enhanced prices. If this story
is demolished, then the whole yarn drops
through a vast hole into chaos. According to
the published price-list, 3d. per lb. duty on
cocoa only raises the price one penny instead of
over 43d. Threepence duty on raisins raises
the price lid. instead of over 44d. The
same duty on currants only raises the price
Id., 2d. duty on groats only raises the price
Id., and a duty of 2d. on sheeps’ tongues
only raises the price 2d. not as
alleged. A threepenny duty on cheese
seems, in one instance, to make the price less,
and a duty of Is. on matches only raises the
cost to the consumer by 9d. The fact that
locally-made matches are much cheaper still is
judiciously smothered. A duty of 2d. on mon-
key soap seems to raise the price Jd., and 2d.
per lb. on starch only makes it dearer.
These and some others to the same effect are
the Horrors of Protection person’s own figures,
so they are doubtless as good on his own side of
the question as he could make them. The
interesting result is that, whereas he asserts
that the importer charges the duty on to the
consumer with 60 per cent, added, he
only ventures to distinctly allege, despite
his great capacity for alleging things,
three cases out of 40 where that is done
and in 16 cases the extra price isn’t even equal
to the duty. Therefore, by the Freetrade
writer’s own showing the 60 per cent, is a fic-
tion, and the =£4,900,000 odd which he builds
upon it as the cost of Protection to Victoria is
a vision,, and the “ disastrous effects of Pro-
tection,” in this branch at least, are a premedi-
tated nightmare.
* * * *
Ihe inference, so far as the price-list goes, is
that Protection as an incidental means of pro-
ducing revenue, is rather a cheaper method
than most others. When the State takes <£l
from a Victorian citizen by direct taxation,
there is no possible means of denying that he
pays that <£l. When instead of doing so it
takes ,£1 per medium of a protective tariff, it
would seem that in a number of important
instances the Victorian citizen only pays 16s.
or 155., or from that down to 55., the re-
mainder being paid in the shape of reduced


prices by the foreigner who sent the goods
along, out of his desire to keep the mar-
ket against possible competition created by
Protection. At all events, the list of prices
makes a lamentable hash of the garbled statis-
tics which show the Victorian as being robbed
of something like £5,000,000 a year by his fiscal
policy. That theory is all built on the story of
how the duty is passed on with 60 per cent,
added, and, the author of it having knocked the
bottom out of his own chimera, the structure
comes down—thud !
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Whisper from Bull-Land.
Hugh Watt, the British syndicator and ex-
M.P. —who alleges that Premier Kingston
didn’t throw him out of his office with con-
tumely, whereas Kingston claims that he did—
is again heard of. Watt is trying to bring
pressure to bear on the British Government to
have the Northern Territory erected into a
separate province, and as he doubtless has
influential boodle at his back the scheme may
not be so hopeless as it seems. Probably
it is as hopeless as it seems, but at 16,000 miles
distance there is no absolute certainty. At all
events, however hopeless it may be now, there
is always the possibility that, if the circum-
stances of the country remain as at present, the
scheme may become possible at a future day
when some more influential boodle accumulates
behind it. The Northern Territory, as matters
now stand, is an anomaly and a perpetual
danger. It was part of New South Wales, at
the time when New South Wales included not
only the present province but also Victoria,
Queensland and all of the continent except
Westralia and S.A. The separation of Queens-
land cut it off from the remaining territory of
the mother province, and it was abandoned
under circumstances that are still so very hazy
that no one really knows whether it is British
or cornstalk property. At all events, the
British Government lent it casually to S.A.,
which governs it, and is also partly governed
by it as it returns members to S.A. Par-
liament, and which stands the loss on its
railway and telegraph system, and is* respon-
sible for the accumulated deficit. Yet the
British Government refuses to allow its for-
mal annexation to S.A. ; it has separate
accounts, and is partly an individual province
bossed by a Government Resident and partly
a bit of the political system which centres
at Adelaide. It is distinctly specified that the
Imperial authorities may resume possession of
it, and this possibility has to be kept con-
stantly in view. S.A., at all events, isn’t
strong enough by itself to prevent the resump-
tion of the Territory, though an Australian
Commonwealth probably could remonstrate
with sufficient vigor if such a thing was sug-
gested. Now that the Rand boom has appa-
rently reached its limit, and the Westrahan
boom seems to be on its last legs, the desire for
a new country to exploit is much felt by J.
Bull, and the uncertain tenure of the Ter-
ritory suggest it as a field for operations.
Booming nowadays is done on a magnificent
scale and wants a lot of elbow-room, and the
Territory is almost the only empty place left
where a new Rhodes might start a Napoleonic
career of finance. Watt, ex-M.P., is the per-
son who has pegged out the Territory as his
especial stamping-ground, and on the occasion
when he alleges that he was not ejected from
Kingston’s office he was practically endeavor-
ing to arrange for its cession to an English
syndicate. If the British Government could
be induced to erect it into a separate province
of 523,000 square miles, with a population of
1159 Europeans and 3626 Chinamen, and with
practically no revenue and only one place that
can with any show of reason be called a town,
the chances are that any enterprising syndicate
could buy up its hopeless little Legislature and
almost all its population, and get for a moderate
outlay the right to do almost anything for
practically as long as it liked. Then the Terri-
tory would probably become an alien province
of black labor and Chinamen and leprosy and
semi-military dictatorship, and a thorn in the
side of white Australia for many years to come.
Whether Watt, ex-M.P., amounts to anything
it is impossible to say—most likely he doesn’t;
but, if present conditions endure, he or some
other boomer will almost certainly amount to
something in this matter sooner of later. The
Territory is such a spacious terra incognita—
such a magnificent place for a syndicate to
boom and lie about and sell mining concessions
in, and to trade off in agricultural allotments,
and to float companies about for raising sugar
and pearls and Cain and other things with nigger
labor, that the need of a central authority to
take a firm grip of it in the name of all Aus-
tralia is obvious.
Some Vandemonian Politicians.
The Braddon-Fysh Government appeals this
month to the electors of Tasmania, and so far
as appears at present it will be returned to
office very peacefully by the uncomplaining
tax-payer. Politics make very little row and
fury in Vandemonia. The Braddon crowd
came unobtrusively into office in 1894 when
Tasmania had the biggest deficit in proportion
to its revenue in the seven provinces, and was
in a bad way generally ; and the Government
and the province have stumbled agreeably
downhill together ever since. Retrenchment
was the especial whoop of the Braddon
Ministry, and as a retrenchment Government it
has been at least a partial success. It sacked
many uninfluential public servants and reduced
the salaries of others; especially it cut down
the wages of the railway employes to about the
lowest possible figure. In addition to this it
adopted the wise and business-like course of in-
creasing the land-tax from to Id. in the £
on capital values. The tax, however, was not a
graduated one but fell on the large and small
owner alike ; it was a mere revenue device, and
did nothing at all to break up the huge estates
with which Tasmania is encumbered. Also,
the Braddon Government levied an income-
tax of Bd. in the £ on incomes derived from
personal exertion and Is. in the £ on in-
comes derived from property. flhis dis-
tinction between personal and property in
comes was almost the only Democratic
feature in its record, and the fact that it drove
the income-tax measure through Parliament
showed that the Braddon Ministry had a lot
of reserve strength. In other ways its financial
policy consisted in making what revenue it
could out of Tattersall’s sweeps, in doing
deals with land-grabbing syndicates, and most
of all in making the accounts square by paying
current expenditure out of loans. In this par-
ticular swindle the Braddon-Fysh Cabinet is
the very worst in proportion to its circum-
stances in Australasia ; fully one eighth of its
ordinary expenditure is paid out of loans and
passed along to posterity, while even New
Bouth Wales only cooks its accounts to the
extent of about one-fifteenth. Probably the
best thing to be said for the present Tas.
Ministry is that, though it is financially the
worst in Australia, the Tas. Ministry which
preceded it was worse still, and that is only
negative praise. The latest news is that Brad-
don, probably with a view to the elections, has
weakened miserably on the only good points in
his financial policy. He doesn’t propose to
graduate the land-tax so as to do something
serious to the handful of big estates which block
settlement in Tasmania, and there is no State
Bank or Credit Foncier or Land for Closer Set-
tlement scheme, or other beastly revolutionary
device, in his political programme. But he
appeals to the electors of the Land of Lots of
Sleep with the assurance that :
Ministers regard it as incumbent upon them to favor a
reduction in the rates levied from Is. to 9d. in the £1 on
realised wealth, and from Bd. to 6d. in the £1 on personal
exertion, and to increase the exemption for the relief of
recipients of small fixed salaries. . . . The Govern-
ment proposes to realise a smaller revenue from the land,
both directly by a land-tax, and indirectly by an income-
tax.
Tasmania is still practically insolvent. The
public revenue is really .£60,000, or so, per
annum behind the expenditure, and it is only
by charging .£llO,OOO of the regular expendi-
ture to loans that any semblance of prosperity
can be kept up. There is an accumulated short-
age of about .£BOO,OOO, though half of it is
partially kept out of sight by judicious book-
keeping—a shortage equal to more than a year’s
revenue. The country wants its big estates
broken up so as to make room for population-
through want of population and goods to carry
the Tasmanian railways do little more than
paying working expenses and engine-grease. It
wants new roads, new industries, a new Upper
House instead of the present property-qualified
institution, and, above all, it wants to learn to
own itself and its own soul instead of being
owned and bossed by Melbourne syndicates.
And the Ministry goes to the country at this
juncture with a great scheme for letting all the
old evils remain as they are, and for reducing
taxation so that the already insolvent province
may be a little more insolvent still. And yet
Braddon is a comparatively active and pro-
gressive man, as active and progressive men go
in slow old Vandemonia.
That Blanket Contract.
The principal Freetrade organ in Sydney still
labors like a raft in a heavy sea to demonstrate
that the famous blanket-contract of the Reid
Government is not an infringement of its fiscal
faith. It is a difficult piece of work certainly,
but the organ toils at it incessantly. Its latest
effort was a leading article published on January
5, in which it wrestled with the matter as
follows:
The mere fact that the local manufacture of the articles
required has been made a condition of the proposed con-
tract is enough to cause those Protectionists who do not
look below the surface of the matter to hail the innova-
tion as a departure from the policy of Freetrade. That it
is nothing of the kind a moment’s candid examination
should be sufficient to show. The essential purpose of
Protection is to bring into existence local industries, as
the acceptance of such a tender as the Government invites
would also do, hut it is in the means by which this would
be accomplished that the difference lies. The Govern-
ment do not propose offering any subsidy whatever out of
the taxpayers’ pockets in order that the blanket-manu-
facturing industry may be developed. What their an-
nouncement conveys is that if local makers can guarantee
the supply of an article on terms as advantageous as those
offered by any others, they will be given the preference.
It is simply intended as a test which will prove whether
it is possible that Government requirements in a par-
ticular branch of supply can be as well satisfied here as
they can be abroad. In respect to blankets : if there is
anyone in New South Wales able to make them as good
and cheap as those imported, he can have an order which
should keep him going for a long time. The protectionist
principle is not introduced in such a proposal in the
smallest degree. That principle looks to the prohibition
of imports in order that manufacturers may have the
market to themselves, and, for a time at least, receive
subsidies from the public in the form of increased prices,
which they can command through the absence of com-
petition. What the Government offers is to guarantee a
certain demand to manufacturers who can compete with
all others. The Government, as a Freetrade Administra-
tion, are under the necessity of assuring themselves,
before any tender is accepted, that the tenderer is pre-
pared to give as good value as any other supplier who
might be contracted with.
All this is so clear that even if it were put
inside a barrel of tar and buried underneath the
sunken city of Atlantis it couldn’t be more
beautifully distinct. Still, it leaves the ends
of a good many loose improbabilities hanging
out. It is not much use to say that the announce-
ment that all foreign makers are shut out
merely “ conveys that if local makers can supply
an article on terms as advantageous as any
others ” they will get the contract; in any case,
that has been so all along, and everybody knew
it, and it didn’t need to be “ conveyed ” at all.
The idea of testing whether the State’s “re-
quirements can be as well satisfied here as
abroad ” by shutting out tenders from abroad
is an elaborately upside-down idea; according
to this narrative it is for the express purpose of
comparing the N.S.W. and foreign tenders on
absolutely equal terms that the foreign tenders
are banned altogether so as to prevent any
comparison. The Government, it is alleged,
does not “propose offering any subsidy out of
the taxpayers’ pockets” by paying a higher
price for local blankets than for im-
ported, and in proof of this it is stipulated
that the blankets in question must be locally
made ; the importer isn’t even allowed to put
his prices forward. The object of keeping the
foreign maker’s prices out of sight altogether is,
it appears, to make it quite clear to everybody
that his prices are not higher than the local
man’s, and that there is consequently no subsidy
to local industry, and no Protection. Further,
“ the Government, as a Freetrade Administra-
tion, are under the necessity of assuring them-
selves, before any tender is accepted, that the
tenderer is prepared to give as good value as
any other supplier who might be contracted
with,” and the simple and natural way to do
this is, of course, to entirely exclude the other
supplier, so that, even if he is prepared to give
better value, the fact can’t be made known.
The attempts to prove that the Reid Govern-
ment’s Protection isn’t Protection at all, but is
really a specially advanced variety of Freetrade,
are a soulful evidence of the advantages to be
derived by carrying a large hunk of logic uphill
and then letting it roll down again.

Only Sixpence.
Dear Bulletin, —Melbourne sentiment is
somewhat divided as to the brutal injustice or
otherwise of a Prahran (Vic.) magistrate who
gave a middle-aged woman seven days for the
theft of sixpence, but the tendency of the press
is to shriek severely and unanimously at the
Prahran beak. “ Nothing w T as previously
known against the prisoner,” and her sentence
at a casual glance seems very hard on a first
offender. I want to figure the matter out
quietly and without hysterics. The middle-
aged woman was not in pressing need of six-
pence. “She appeared to be slightly under
the influence of liquor when arrested” (which
suggests a personal expenditure on beer before
doing the deed), and by her own statement,
when pleading guilty, she went into a dairy-
man’s shop “ to make a purchase, and seeing
the money on the shelf was tempted to take
it.” The dairyman, witnessing the larceny and
being possibly as much in need of sixpence
as his customer was, offered to let her go
free if she handed over the loot, but she
denied the offence and maintained a death-
grip on the coin until he gave her into
custody. In short, she was a full - sized
thief, who had yielded to the weak temptation
of two threepenny-bits. A ,£lOO note or a
diamond ring on the dairyman’s shelf would
probably have gone where the sixpence went—-
into her pocket—and then she would have been
reckoned rightly punished with six months’ im-
prisonment at the least. She took all she could
see, and the fact that she took it on very
slight provocation—inasmuch as she saw only
sixpence, unless the beer doubled her
powers of vision—was the best possible proof
of her natural and full - blown dishonesty.
No woman could steal more coin than all the
coin within reach, therefore she was as large and
comprehensive a thief as she knew how. The
questions at issue are : Should punishment go
strictly and invariably according to the amount
stolen ? If the theft of, say, .£1 would carry a
sentence of 28 days, ought there to be 75 per-
cent. discount because the prisoner didn’t get
the chance to steal the whole pound, but took
all that was going ? Also, if, as is commonly
and rightly held to be the case, dire necessity
is an excuse for theft, isn’t the absence of any
necessity an aggravation of it ?. In short, are
there not cases where the theft of sixpence
might be worth even 14 days, to say nothing of
seven. In this case, I am with the Prahran
beak.—F.
A Very Small Matter.
The latest Australian shipping strike, which
raged for one consecutive day and then pro-
ceeded to taper off, was mainly about a matter
of somebody’s small dignity. Most of the
really important questions were in a fair way
for settlement before the strike began. A few
years ago, when the shipping business was in a
bad way, the wages of the marine engineers
were heavily reduced; now the boom in
Westralia has brought sudden prosperity to the
trade, but until the engineers kicked hard
there was no sign of their pay being restored to
the original figure. The shipping companies
were willing that their employes should share
their bad fortunes, but sharing their good ones
was quite a different matter. In addition to
the wages difficulty there were sundry
other matters of dispute, but when the
engineers, after some fruitless negotiation,
gave notice of their intention to start the
strike w'ithin 24 hours, the companies gave up
the most important points at issue and offered
to confer about the others. But they were
willing to do this on one condition only : that
the engineers withdrew their notice to quit,
and it became understood that there was no
compulsion in the matter, and that the com-
panies were simply conferring a boon in a lordly
and condescending fashion of their own, and
that the employes, w-ho hadn’t dared to ask for
it, w r ere receiving it with intense surprise and
gratitude, or something to that effect. The
trouble which led to the laying-up of 15 vessels
in Melbourne and to a serious dislocation of
trade, really came about because the marine
engineers declined to say that they hadn’t
given notice when every one knew that they
had, or to allege that they were receiving their
concessions simply because of the noble char-
acter of the shipowner, when everybody knew
that they were not. The respectable press
lamented a good deal over the small cussed-
ness of the men who were prepared to make
so large a trouble over so small a matter, but
there was a unanimous lack of any reference to
the baby dignity of the shipowners, who in-
vented and insisted upon the absurd condition.
The trouble presently simmered down, and the
question of dignity was unobtrusively buried
somewhere out of sight. It was, as the respect-
able press truly remarked, a very small matter,
and it would have been an equally small matter
if the companies, after conceding the more im-
portant points at dispute, had insisted on the
engineers turning three somersaults apiece in
Collins-street as an essential condition of peace,
or getting their hair cut sideways, or any other
grotesque trifle. Being a small matter, and a
very foolish one also, no one seems to know
exactly what became of it or where its grave is
located.
B. R. Wise, of N.S.W., was the first Federal
Convention candidate to issue an address to the
electors. The two main features of his pro-
gramme are that there must be no fiscal or
other local party politics in the Convention,
and that “ the delegates should enter the Con-
vention, not as hucksterers who are seeking,
each of them, to make the best bargain for his
own province, but as Australians.” In other
words they should cease drawing up elaborate
schemes to prevent each other’s province from
getting ahead and accept things as they
are. r J here is no end to the ways in which
each State can show that it will be robbed of
°i d - by the pooling of the various debts and
rates of interest and more or less profitable
railway and postal systems, and to the con-
struction of bottomless devices for portioning
out the surplus so that one province won’t be
benefited to the extent of only 2£d. while its
neighbor revels in 3Jd. It should be a good
omen that the electoral address of the first
Con vention delegate calls on the people of Aus-
tralia to abjure the penny-farthing aspect of
things, and think more about making a nation
than about the possible dropping of a copper
in the process. Provided B. R. Wise’s appeal
to the provinces not to huckster does not mean
simply that the other provinces are not to
huckster but to let Wise’s province have its
own way in everything, then the ex-Attorney-
General has struck the right key-note.
4.
A large case of false-swearing by half-a-dozen
policemen is just now agitating the public mind
of Maoriland. A well-known Auckland share-
broker picked up a lost child in the street, and,
taking it to a policeman, asked him to convey it
to the lock-up. This Robert refused to do,
whereat the other said he would take the child
to the station, and, at the same time, report the
“copper’s ” conduct. This threat incensed the
man in blue, for he also repaired to the watch-
house by a shorter cut, and, when the share-
broker arrived with the youngster, promptly
preferred a charge of drunk and disorderly
against him. The broker wanted to lay his
complaint, but was hustled from one policeman
to another, kicked down several stone steps, re-
fused an audience by the inspector, half-stripped
of his clothes, and generally rolled about, and was
finally locked in a cell. In between times the
inspector put his head in at the cell window, and
chaffed his prisoner, and made himself disagree-
able in his own small way. At the court, next
day, half-a-dozen police officials swore that the
prisoner was drunk, &c. One officer of a dis-
criminating turn of mind explained that the
culprit was “ mad drunk with whisky.” Against
this, an overwhelming mass of evidence proved
that the sharebroker was absolutely sober, and
he was at once discharged, and five of the
policemen were suspended from duty pending
a departmental inquiry. The inquiry re-
sulted in one or two being sacked and two
being “ invited to resign.” Strangely enough,
however, no prosecution has been heard
of so far, therefore people want to know if the
big man in blue is privileged to commit perjury
and conspiracy without suffering the same
consequences as other people. The policeman
is by habit and repute a hard swearer, and his
perjury is difficult to find out because the
average cop corroborates his brother cop under
all circumstances. If nothing particular is to
happen to him when he is found out then it
seems that a constable may be defined as a man
who is dressed up in a uniform and turned
loose in the streets with power to swear any-
thing with impunity.
Sydney Telegraph in its trade review pub-
lished Ist January, ’97 :
The great event of the year has been the removal of
duties, and at the time of the alteration in the tariff
opinions as to the future course of values were very
diverse. During the interval prices have so far recovered
that consumers have to now pay as much as and even
more than they did when an additional 10 per cent, was
levied by the Customs-house, which means that if the
duties current a year ago had remained intact, prices
would be fully 10 per cent, higher than they are at
present. This has been advantageous to importers,
manufacturers and consumers alike.
From the above, two inferences stick out con-
spicuously : (1) Prices have gone up under Free-
trade, whereas it was promised they would go
down ; (2) when prices go up it is “ advantage-
ous to importers, manufacturers, and consumers
alike,” yet the Telegraph has been publishing
a long series of articles in which it is alleged
that prices have gone up in Victoria because of
Protection, and describing the rise as fraud,
robbery, &c. Therefore, it seems that a rise of
prices under Foreign-trade is advantageous and
proves that Foreign-trade is right, while a rise
of prices under Protection is horrible and proves
that Protection is utterly wrong. How did the
Telegraph thunder-blast the Dibbs Ministry
on the alleged ground that its system sent
prices up and heaped a burden on the back of
the poor ! Why wasn’t it mentioned then that
advanced prices were “ advantageous ” all
round ?
The Melb. fly-flat stamp-dealer, who lately
started to swindle the Post-office department
by removing ink stains from receipt-stamps, can
thank the scandalous carelessness of the said
department for his present troubles. The pos-
sibility of working his simple little fraud—
which, by the way, was reported at head-
quarters by the Philatelic Society in the first
instance—should have been prevented some
time ago, long before the brilliant dealer had
found out the secret of converting second-hand
stamps into new. The Postal department
admits, quite casually, that it used to put
the old telegraph forms into a chemical
solution, for the purpose of separating
the cancelled stamps from the forms.
Which treatment was “ found to obliterate
the cancel marks on the stamps, and it was seen
to be unsafe to continue a system under which
the old stamps might be exploited in the man-
ner of the Webb case. The department there-
upon decided to burn the old messages.” But
the issue of fast-color stamps went on as before,
notwithstanding this suggestive revelation.
In point of fact, the present fraud was invited
by departmental methods, and it seems more
than likely that one of the postal officers put
the culprit up to it.
About the latest news from London con-
cerns a lecture on Australian Federation delivered
at the Imperial Institute by “ Major John C.
Neild, Commissioner on Charities for New South
Wales.” That is the tremendous blast of designa-
tion on the ticket of admission. Apparently
Neild is breaking his numerous titles and billets
gently to the British nation. If he came out with
the shattering information all in one lump the
nation would probably faint, and then before
water could be poured over it and the door-key
put down its back, some foreign Power might in-
vade the country and overturn the Constitution.

Saturday, has got the brand of failure written
large upon it. It is a ladylike failure of a very
able description, enshrined in a good deal of nice
furniture and some beautiful hangings, and a
great amount of expensive clothing cut low. It
has the same aspect of glittering worldly weari-
ness which characterises Wilde’s plays in general,
but the weariness is more tired and less brilliant
than usual. The first incident worth calling such
comes in at the end of the third act; until then
the production consists mostly of four ladies
sitting in chairs talking about morals. They talk
of very little else than morals, not as women who
haven’t any, but rather as people who are too
weary and too much jewelled and too bare
about the shoulders to care whether they have
any or not. The plot is only a streak alto-
gether. In the first act, Titheradge, a British
lord, whose conversation is one labored pur-
suit of the weary epigram, engages a nice local
youth (Edward Ferris) as his secretary, and the
four ladies converse a lot about morals. In Act
11. he discovers that the new secretary is his
illegitimate son, and the mother comes in and
listens, with an haggard eye, to the awful conver-
sation about morals. About the end of Act 111.
the new secretary (after a good deal of conversa-
tion about women and morals) finds the tired lord
trying to kiss his best girl—the only one in the
crowd who doesn’t talk needlessly about morals ;
and is only prevented from slaying him on the spot
by a shrieking woman, who tells him that the lord
is his own father. Then the curtain goes down on a
disastrous heap of morals, and in Act IY. the mother
refuses to marry the lord, and the son decides to
marry the girl who doesn’t talk about morals, and
the four ladies with the jewellery and the tired
conversation fade out of the story.

There is very little incident, but a number
of people are told at considerable length about
various incidents which happened 20 years pre-
viously. A dozen or two of the epigrams are
brilliant, and the other 357 are merely rather
ordinary statements turned upside down and kept
that way with difficulty by a rope tied to their
feet. Hardly anybody makes one plain, ordinary
remark all through ; all the leading characters
are struggling desperately all the time to lift the
heavy epigram out of its bed and hoist it on top
of the conversation, and the result suggests brain-
fag and hard conflict. The author’s stock of in-
cident apparently gave out very early in his dra-
matic career. Now his best idea is to get two men
into a room and let them talk about women in
labored brilliances that have the footprints of the
gas-meter upon them to show how they were
struggled with in the small hours of the morning.
“ A Woman of No Importance ” is a clever play
of a kind ; it makes the auditor feel weary with an
expensive kind of weariness as if he had slept all
night in his dress-suit, and was a duke with
.£lOO,OOO a year, and hadn’t been properly in bed
for three weeks, and never expected to take any
interest again in anything as long as he lived.
Titheradge and Mrs. Brough do most of the dead
ljft in this play, and do it exceedingly well, and
Brough and Misses Hardy and Temple fill in some
smaller parts quite satisfactorily. Of the three
pew people, Mrs. Bracy is excellent in an old
woman part; Miss Florence Seymour is not excel-
lent so far, and Edward Ferris, who presents a
half resemblance to Charles Arnold, looks as if he
might be very good when he gets on to something
more congenial. At present there is compara-
tively little to say about him, except that he has
a tendency to look like Charles Arnold.

“ Tommy Atkins,” at Sydney Royal, goes
In its third week with as healthy a roar and bang
as on the opening night, and if it isn’t good for
several weeks longer it certainly deserves to be.
There are many things to admire in “Atkins,”
but what this paper most admires is the bad cap-
tain with three wives—his light-heartedness and
bis excessively beautiful clothes, and the way his
conscience doesn’t trouble him and the spectre of
his victims never worries him in the night. Pro-
bably the most attractive feature in the captain’s
character comes out when his second unmarried
Wife decides to drown herself and her infant, and
so remove herself comfortably out of his road.
Whereupon the captain considers the river
thoughtfully, and notes with his perfectly
honest smile that it is a very nice river,
pool and shady and picturesque and ferny,
and about the pleasantest river imaginable
for any man’s second wife to be,found in without
any trouble. Then he considers his second wife
with aq artistic eye, and evidently decides that
she will look a very nice girl to be found in just
such a river, so like a true gentleman he steps into
the woods that the lady may drown herself with-
out being embarrassed by his presence. There is
so much artistic feeling about Diver as he looks
round for a suitable place for his second wife to
drown herself in, so that her hair may harmonise
with the ferns on the shore when she is fished out
about the middle of next week, that the sinful
captain in “Tommy Atkins” deserves to be re-
membered as something above the average of his
kind. The ordinary dramatic captain doesn’t care
twopence whether his second wife drowns herself
in a nice spot or not; this one, as everybody feels,
would sooner shove her in at a nice place than let
her fall in naturally where the surroundings were
repugnant to his feelings as a gentleman.

At Her Majesty’s (Sydney) Crackles still
has another hat continually. Latterly, however,
his glory has paled somewhat before that of Law-
ton, who gets someone to throw dead rodents at
him from the wings, and grabs them eagerly as
they arrive, remarking “I’ve got another rat.’
The public hardly knows whether to pin its faith
most to the man who has another hat or the man
who has another rat, and, so far, these two intense
jokes constitute most of the verbal mirth of the
panto. The Lucifers, however, who never fade
and never get another hat, are a vast success and a
joy for ever, and when the male Lucifer kicks ten
feet high with both legs at once, and shoulders
arms with his leg for a musket, the public enthu-
siasm rises to fever heat, and even if Crackles got
other hats all at once he would pass unnoticed
at that moment of supreme contortion. The Bul-
letin, by the way, received a kind invitation from
the management to inspect Mr. Lucifer privately,
but it didn’t attend. It likes that gentleman
much in his airy moments on the stage,_ but the
undressed athlete in a serious frame of mind hav-
ing his chest-measurement taken with a tape
spoils the effect. The second edition of “ Sinbad”
is due on Saturday.

Charles M‘Carthy’s robust brogue is to
make its second essay at Sydney Lyceum on
Saturday in “ True Irish Hearts.” This produc-
tion is described as “ the great musical comedy-
drama,” but, as The Bulletin never heard of it
before, and the author isn’t mentioned, and nothing
is said about it having run even one half-night at
Jamberoo, let alone having made a furore in all
the leading cities of the world, this paper indulges
in no prognostications, and approaches the subject
in a perfectly unbiassed spirit.

. The Palace is mostly in a condition of
standing-room only, and not much of that. The
co. is decidedly stronger than it was at the open-
ing, Wilton and Stack, the Delevines, Knowles,
and Miss Antonio, the lady who makes music
upside - down, being a powerful combination.
Sydney Tivoli likewise keeps the wonted boom
going, and the very mild business doing at some
of the big theatres is calculated, by comparison, to
make Brutus and Hamlet and the Silver King
wish they had learned to support themselves by
their teeth from a nail rather earlier in life.

No less than three cinematographes are
now pervading Sydney. Jimmy MacMahon’s
was the first in the field, and hangs out at its old
quarters opposite the Lyceum, where a new series
of pictures has been turned on. The “only
genuine original ” cin., at 478 George-street, has
also turned on a fresh series, and a third arrival,
“the latest and most improved” ’graphe, has
lately opened at 420 George-street. When this
paper has got rested a little, and its corn isn’t
quite so bad, it contemplates making another
serious examination of all three, and hearing each
manager’s unbiassed opinion of the other two at
full length.

‘ ‘ Matsa, ” at Melb. Princess’s, continues
to achieve eight performances per week without
betraying any signs of exhaustion. In point of
fact, the show went stronger than ever on Satur-
day night, when a reconstructed third act was
gratefully received. The change is a pretty vast
improvement on the original third act, inasmuch
as the new scene introduces more legs and dazzle,
also it provides a semblance of natural end to the
story, which used to finish like a nightmare in the
sky. Under present arrangements, the principals
have a chance to explain themselves before a
Khedive, or somebody. Their explanation is
feeble, and the interpolated potentate seems right
out of his element ; nevertheless George Lauri,
Florence Young and the rest deserve some credit
for trying to clear up the awful mystery of their
previous careers. Little Gulliver looms funnier
than before, Ivy Scott and Carrie Moore sing a
brighter duet, the boxing cats display more ability
at landing one another on the jaw, and the flying
angels are now well-nigh perfect in the poetry of
motion. The supers., disguised as wild beasts,
make a dumb appeal for further eulogy, likewise
the toothsome lady representatives of various
newspapers may be cordially referred to. Seeing
that one of them impersonates The Bulletin,
and does particular credit to her billet, the pre-
sent writer would like to know the state of her
feelings as regards the staff. This matter has been
agitating p.w.’s mind strangely, ever since Boxing
Night.

At the Bijou, there is a steady demand for
Frank Thornton’s production of the red-haired
she-male that went astray. “ Miss Brown,” roam-
ing at large among the lady boarders arid dodging
the swarthy embraces of the vision from Demerara,
is a humorous subject with shocking possibilities
in it. A comedy which offers plenty of scope for
the imagination, and sets people wondering
whether the seminary takes a warm bath on
Friday evenings subsequently to fixing up its hair
in plaits, was bound to succeed. It rivets the at-
tention of the audiences all round from the moment
when they learn that each young lady has a bed-
room to herself and that all of them are addicted
to a hopeless passion for the music-master, except-
ing pretty Miss Seabrooke, the boarder who ran
away to get married. In her heart the ghastly
piano-thumper reigns no more, but her maiden
companions are understood to be still dreaming
about the scarecrow when the curtain falls.
“ For England ” is doing the same as usual,
or even better, at the Royal. Two or three out-
side reasons for the rush to Bland Holt’s plucky
spectacle are mentioned. In some quarters it is
confidently expected to be a pantomime, whilst a
jingo five per cent, of the crowded congregation
takes the show to be a Heed that Won the Hem-
pire. “For England” gives full satisfaction to
all parties. The fox-hunt is more exciting than a
panto., and the bogus destruction of the Boers by
Walter Baker is just as pleasing to himpenal
sentiment as though it were founded on fact. For
the great mass of visitors the scenery, Zulu
Marks, and the hanging in store for Albert Nor-
man are three great sources of joy, and they go
home loaded with value for their money.

Her Majesty’s—otherwise the poor old
Aleck—was possibly struggling on when this
journal went to press. “Fun on the Bristol”
came to a bitter conclusion early last week, yet
the house resumed business on Saturday with
“The Temptations of a Nurse Girl.” The new
drama (suspected of having sprung from Ballarat)
did no justice to its title. The leading horror was
a comic Idiot, who hopped around the stage
stating that he knew what was going on, and the
duty, seemingly, of all the other men, who didn’t
know what was going on, was to let the aforesaid
Idiot knock them down. If they ventured to rise
they were knocked down some more. The Bul-
letin is not quite sure whether the Idiot stoushed
the Nurse Girl likewise, or merely rescued her
from temptation. Whatever may have happened
eventually,, the fiend with softening of the brain
was certain to boss the incident, but after waiting
a long time for the Temptations, the press with-
drew. Up to 9.45 p.m. there was no temptation
of any kind, save a bloodthirsty desire to throw a
brick at the company. Human endurance has its
limit.

John Coleman, Alice Leamar, Edgar Gran-

standard of Rickards at the Opera House, and
that reliable establishment looks prosperous. The
other night, on the occasion of the elements break-
ing loose, some rain came through Rickards’ roof,
but the stalls opened their umbrellas and stuck to
their seats ; which speaks well for the exhilarating
quality of the entertainment. The roof is now
watertight, and brollies may be left in the cloak-

The show given by the Cat King, at Melb.
Princess’s is said to be much more surprising than
it appears to anyone who doesn’t know the facts
of the case, which facts, unfortunately, are not
suitable for bold advertisement. Seven of Clark’s
“ star ” pussies were stolen from his stock on the
steamer ; at any rate they were missing when the
boat reached Melbourne. The cats now playing
leading business are “understudies,” and the
trainer’s patient instruction is rapidly bringing
them up to the artistic level of their lost com-
E anions, Besides the seven cats, Clark found
imself minus a whole flock of trick canaries, also
he lost a couple of professional fighting cocks
under melancholy circumstances. The birds were
suffering from parasites in the feathers, and an
attempt at cold water cure by turning the ship’s
hose on them either washed them overboard or set
up congestion of the lungs aggravated by pleurisy,
or something equally fatal. After a pathetic
struggle for existence, the roosters were buried at
sea.
The Wild-Cat Column .
The people who have hopes about a speedy rise
in the values of Australian city property invited to
seriously consider these facts : The annual value of all
Sydney and its suburbs, according to the municipal
assessment, which bears a tolerably steady relationship to
the actual rental, fell from six millions in ’92 to about
five millions in ’96. The assessed value of Melbourne fell
from nearly seven millions to about five. These are re-
garded as abnormally low values, the unnatural result of
the bursting of the boom. Yet the assessed annual
value of all Glasgow is only millions ; of Manchester
and Salford about 3f millions. Both are larger than either
Sydney or Melbourne ; Glasgow especially is much larger.
They haven’t had any exploded hoom of recent years ;
they aren’t specially depressed ; in fact they are both
practically in their normal condition. Also they have
more industries and more visible means of support than
either Sydney or Melbourne. The value of money in this
country is steadily tending down to British rates,
and prices and wages are getting there also. There-
fore there seems every probability that rents, and
consequently the value of properties, will do likewise.
The inference is that the old figures were merely
boom valuations, brought about by the influx of bor-
rowed money ; that the present values, on the whole
are only the natural values, or it may be that they are
still somewhat above the natural values ; and that there
will be no rise (beyond what is caused by increase of
population) worth speaking of for years, unless it be
brought about by another borrowing frenzy, with a
worse smash and a greater depression to follow.'
The old inflated values were made up partly of
the price of land when it was raised to an absurd figure
by insane speculation ; partly of the price of bricks when
they were worth, say, twice as much as they are now ;
partly of the price of other materials when they were also
from 50 to 100 per cent, dearer than at present; partly of
the cost of labor when wages were vastly higher ; partly
of the interest on the money borrowed on mort-
gage when money was worth 10 per cent, instead
of five or six These things were all at boom valuations,
and out of them were built two great boom cities But
considering the circumstances of the case, there seems
very little probability of the old conditions coinim- back
again._ The chances are that affairs will simply "settle
down in something like their present state, and that the
existing order of things isn’t a depression but merely a
gradual finding of the natural level. At all events? when
it is remembered that even the present assessed values of
Sydney and Melbourne are greater than those of the
morfc populous city of Glasgow, and are verv far
ahead of every other British city save London ft is
difficult to feel quite sure that these values are ’abnor
nially low and that a rise must ensue shortly.

in £33 423 more revenue than for the corresponding
period of 1895. Considering that every province except
N.S.W. shows a large revenue increase, and the fall in
N.S.W. is mostly the result of the change in the system
of taxation, there appears reason to believe that this
country is looking up very considerably just now.

New South Wales has increased its public debt
by £9,300,000 in the last five years. The Victorian debt
in the same period has increased by only £4,000,000. The
5U million difference fully accounts for the depression
being- more severe in one province than in the other. But,
if both were so lamentably depressed despite thisinflux of
borrowed money, where would they have been if there had
been no borrowing ? What an awful recovery these pro-
vinces will have to suffer when the swearing-off does
become inevitable 1 And the longer it is postponed the
worse the recovery will be.

Victoria has at last got its factory-returns for
1895 into print. The figures show a big advance on last
year’s. The returns for five years are : 1891, 3320 fac-
tories, 53,525 employes ; 1892, 3055 factories, 43,921 em-
ployes ; 1893, the bottom year in Victorian industries,
2737 factories, 39,815 employes; 1894, 2675 factories,
41 273 employes ; 1895, 2804 factories, 52,095 employes.
This is an increase of 129 establishments and 10,822 em-
ploves in one year—the biggest single year’s increase on
the Vic. record, and one which makes up most of the lee-
way since the boom.

A report of the last six years’ railway operations
in N.S.W., Queensland, S.A. and Vic. furnishes some mate-
rial for hard-thinking. Since 1890, New South Wales has
increased its railway system by 349 miles, Victoria by 471
miles, S.A. by 85 miles, Queensland by 194. The increase
of 349 miles in New South Wales has increased the total
capital expended on the railways by £5,083,577. The in-
crease of 471 miles in Victoria has increased its capital
expenditure by only £1,766,525. South Australia’s in-
crease of 85 miles has added £1,184,604 to the capital
invested, and Queensland’s addition of 194 miles seems to
have cost £1,341,039—at least, these are the respective
increases in the capital charged to the railways in each
province. There certainly seems to be an awful dis-
crepancy in the figures somewhere, seeing that 349 miles
of new line in N.S.W. have apparently added nearly three
times as much to the liabilities as 471 miles in Victoria,
and S.A. appears to have got through nearly as much
money for 85 miles as Queensland did for 194, but, at all
events, the published facts of the case are as above given.
Three of the four railway systems show an in-
creased loss. The Victorian loss was £251,000 more in ’96
than in ’9O. The New South Wales loss increased by
£68,000. The S.A. lines showed a profit of £175,000 over
working expenses and interest on cost of construction in
’9O, and a loss of £64,000 in ’96. The only improvement
is in Queensland, where the ’96 deficit, though it reached
the stupendous sum of £348,000, was still £102,000 less
than in ’9O. The four railway systems put together had
£450,000 more shortage in ’96 than they had six years
previously, which is about as depressing a state of things
as any pessimist could ask for.

Dalgety and Co. (Limited), an institution which
seems to keep well above water even in the worst of
times, shows a net profit of £83,672 for the year ended
30th June, ’96. This is just about £220 less than last
year’s profit, and considering that the co, has first to pro-
vide interest on 12,800,000 worth of debentures it
is a very good result. Still, considering that it is
trading on only £1,143,000 of its own money and on
£2,800,000 of borrowed funds its position might he a
great deal better than it is; Dalgety and Co. is by no
means so top-heavy as some concerns in the same line of
business, but it would be a lot more secure if the
proportion of debenture money wasn’t so heavy. A
dividend of 8 per cent, absorbs £BO,OOO, which leaves
£3672 to the good, and if this rate of progress is main-
tained for 760 years the big institution will he able to pay
off its debentures.and trade solely with its own funds.
Then if something did happen to depreciate the assets 33
per cent, all at once it wouldn’t necessarily be insolvent.

handsome increase compared with £8265 forlastyear, and
£11,571 the year before. Also, there is a balance of £3BOl
from last year, making the total amount available £15,938.
A bonus of 20 per cent, divided between shareholders and
policy-holders absqrbs 18210, and £7728 is carried for-
ward ; so the co. ends the year with nearly £4OOO more
assets than it had at the beginning. The reserve fund

all practical purposes. Out of the profits and the £1478
brought forward from last year shareholders get a 10 per
cent, dividend (£1500); a 10 per cent, bonus to policy-
holders absorbs £1563 ; 1 1500 is added to reserve, making
it £13,500 ; and £873 is carried forward.

ment in April, and expects to pay off in full before the

The Victorians have just discovered, among the
other foolishnesses of their postal management, that the
designs and colors of their stamps are so much more per-
manent than the ink used for cancellation purposes that
it is quite possible to remove the cancellation marks with
salts of lemon or some other simple device. One indi-
vidual, who is alleged to have done a large trade in this
way, has just been captured. He says, among other
things, that the process is perfectly simple, and that he
believes several other people are at the same game ; also,
that he sold some of his cleaned stamps to the postal
authorities themselves without detection. He tried his
solution on the stamps of other provinces, but every-
wdiere except in Victoria it appears that the postal
officials have sufficient intelligence to print their stamps
in colors that won’t stand the cleaning process. Con-

The recent seizure of “ renovated ” postage-
stamps, in Melbourne, has, it is rumored, led to the dis-
covery that, certain lawyers’ clerks have pocketed
sums bujdng the faked articles at 50 per cent, discount
for legal purposes. Considering that stamps up to £lOO
are frequently required in land conveyances, and for over
£lOOO for probate duties, there were evidently very large
possibilities about the business and room for a fine large
breakage of revenue.

Before the electric-light came to Launceston
(Tas.) the Gas Company used to be very independent.
Incoming tenants had to pay the arrears of preceding

dailies got an astonishing bill for his household gas
at the end of his first month. At first he thought
it was a joke. When he found that £9 odd was seri-
ously demanded he forwarded a protest. Back came
the stereotyed reply, “Have examined the meter, and
there is no escape.” He replied, “ Apparently there is
no escape ; cheque enclosed.” Next day he telegraphed,
“There is an escape. I have bought kerosene lamps.
Cut off your gas.” One Launceston daily thereafter took
great interest in the lighting question, and ultimately
electric-light became an accomplished fact.

loan indebtedness is mounting up into big five-figures, is
heard the harsh, John-the-Baptist voice of one alderman,
warning his mates to provide a “sinking fund.” And
this is only when the annual aldermanic elections are on.
One stumping alderman actually bragged to his public
meeting that, although the City Council had “struck”
the scavenging rates as usual for the past two years, the
citizens had not been called upon to pay a penny of them.
Which looks like a broad road to insolvency and repu-
diation.

Northward the sugar empire takes its way.
Mackay and Bundaberg are going the way Maryborough
went lang syne. That is to say, 15 years of continuous
cropping has exhausted much of the rich cane-land, and
planters are on the qui vive for fresh country. The Her-
bert, the Mosman, the Batavia will provide much of the
sugar of the future. When they are used up by the shift-
less methods of the Queensland planter the business must
move on again round the shores of the Gulf to the
Northern Territory or Gehenna or somewhere.

An expert remarks that bogus bank-notes can
always be distinguished from genuine, as they are in-
variably smaller than the latter. The original steel
plates are drawn to allow for the shrinkage of the
transfer paper containing the bank-note imprint, and as
the counterfeiter must necessarily engrave his plate
just the size of the specimen genuine note he traces
from, a discrepancy in their size cannot be avoided when
the damped proofs are pulled and the further shrinkage
ensues.

A div. ought to be due from the B.H. British
by March, but may possibly be deferred until the general
meeting, to be held in London about the end of May.
The co’s half-year ended on Dec. 31, and as the concen-
trators were started in June, the results of a full half-
year’s work will be shown. The operations throughout
have been conducted at a profit.
British B.H. Proprietary directors follow a
practice which some others that are building up alleged
reserves might adopt - with advantage to their share-
holders—set out as part of their balance-sheets the
nature of all their investments.
* * * *
Australia, and N.S. Wales especially perhaps,
hardly yet realises how great its B.H. silver-field still is.
Bendigo, Victoria’s present premier goldfield, produced in
1896 200,2130 z. gold, worth, say, £760,000. B. Hill’s
metal export was worth £1,850,000. Charters Towers,
Q’land’s premier field, not out 260,0000 z. gold, worth, say,
£1,000,000. Broken Hill last year produced a greater
value of metal than Victoria’s alluvial wonder, the Madame
Berry, did in all the years it was worked.
B.H. North shares, after a sharp advance, de-
clined on the temporary stoppage of the exploratory
working from the Junction North. Concerning which
exploratory drive, by the way, let not shareholders and
others when they read (in a North mine newspaper re-
port) that it is in “massive sulphides,” and so on, con-
clude that it is yet inside the North lease. So far as the
lode has been traced it is still far from the boundary.
* * * *
B.H. rainfall for ’96 was 6^in.—the lowest since
the silver-mines were opened. But station records for
the same district credit two consecutive years with under
4in. each 1
* * * *
When the ’9O maritime strike occurred the
Broken Hill mines were soon in difficulties from want of
supplies. As the B.H. miners were good contributors to
the strike-funds an arrangement was made (after three
weeks’ stoppage of work) by which B.H. supplies were
handled at the ports. Upon the outbreak of the
engineers’ trouble the managers lost no time in an-
nouncing that the mines would not be affected; and
shareholders were no doubt appeased. The B.H. Prop.’s
position is strong; it undoubtedly has a big reserve of
coal, &c., which it carefully maintains. But as to the
others there are doubts ; if they have substantial reserves
thev are very skilfully hidden—so skilfully that share-
holders are hardly justified in taking their existence for
granted.

The chairman of the Sydney Harbor Collieries
Co., in London recently, said the co. had received extreme
and bitter opposition from the N.S.W. Govt. “1 do not
like to say too much, but when I tell you that there are
several gentlemen in the Govt, of N.SiW. who are very
largely interested in other collieries ad jacent to Sydney, you
can easily understand any opposition to our scheme that
has arisen.” He then foreshadowed the great things
coming out of this scheme. Perhaps so, but the present
prospects of finding unlimited quantities of good coal at
a depth of 3000 ft. do not warrant the risk of £200,000.
In the Vic. coalfields, it is the practice to keep boring
ahead to locate the seam, because of . the occurrence of
dykes. In this case two bores, heavily subsidised by the
Govt., were put down. One found good coal, the other
very bad. The common-sense plan before starting a
shaft, which alone will cost over £lOO,OOO, would be to
put down some more bores, and find out if the extent and
character of the seam warranted the larger expenditure.
By the way, what is the nature of the “ bitter opposi-
tion ” which the co. received from N.S.W. Govt.? All
that is known here is that the Govt, refused to hand over
one of the most beautiful spots on the harbor to be turned
into an eyesore. Probably that is what the complaint is
about.

“ The warden of Nundle (N.S.W.) has expressed
himself strongly against persons taking up large areas of

The new 30-head stamp-mill on the Gibraltar
mine, Adelong (N.S.W.), has started on the big heap of
rich rock which has long been accumulating. If it can be
kept running on ore as goqd as the first 1000 tons, it will
be a good thing for Adelong.

Perseverance, Stuart-Town (N.S.W.): “The
tributors crushed 19 tons for 2Joz. to the ton. This mine
was recently floated in London for £112,000. The labor-
suspension is up about the middle of Feb., when it is ex-
pected the new co. will begin operations.” With all that
monish, we should hope so, but shall see. Many alleged
London co’s never make a start at all. One already in
the same camp probably wishes it never started, as it
would thereby have saved from £lO,OOO to £15,000. The
working of old, abandoned, and duffered-out N.S.W.
mines by English co’s is a sad spectacle.

Taylor’s Reward mine, N.S.W., now called the
Beacon : First crushing, 1030 oz. for a three weeks’ run of
a 10-head mill —about 300 tons. No time lost in the
erection of the mill, and the Exploration Co. will, it is to
be hoped, pull out well on this deal. Stated that it has
already got a bond on another mine in the same district—
the Coramba King—and is about to test it with a crush-
ing of 1000 tons. The owners’ faith in it must be a long
way above the average. The average N.S.W. mine would
be exhausted before the crushing was through.

The amalgamation of the Victory and Falkner’s

Molong, N.S.W., has evolved a good booming
newspaper mining man. Molong, having no mines erf its
own, he spreads himself around to some purpose. He
gives a great list of the mines “in full swing” at Stuart
Town, and declares that 30 new hands will be put on the
Golden Gully after Xmas. Bull has had a ring through
his nose in this show. A waterjacket is going up on the
Ironclad mine at Cargo, and a sample of ore has yielded
soz. to the ton, besides copper. “As there is a large
body of this ore it is thought that under the smelting
process it will pay well.” One of the mines “ looking
very well ” is the Madman, and there is another of the
same sort doing very well with the poor old S.M. Herald.

Nundle (N.S.W.): “ Several samples of the sup-

Clarke and Co.’s Investors’ Guide for Dec.
contains a special report on the W.A. goldfields by Claude
Maitland. He says of the mines of Ooolgardie, that but
for Burbank’s and a few others, the output would soon
be nil. The “few others” not specified. Burbank’s
itself seems to have been closed to his inspection. The
three big mines of Kalgoorlie—Boulder, Lake View, and
Ivauhoe—will, he thinks, be able to turn out 20,0000 z. a
month among them within the next 12 months. There
are 11 gold-producers, and others will be added shortly.
As in Ooolgardie, more attention has been paid to floating
blocks, many of which are of no value, than to bona fide
mining, and some shows even in the immediate vicinity of
the big mines are very disappointing up to date. The
number of co’s which must collapse from the want of
gold will be startling. The careful enumeration of all the
big yields and omission of all the duffers colors the
description.

Clarke and Co. ’s circular comes to an unsympa-

The Great Fingail Reefs, Limited, capital,
£175,000, fully paid, is the latest Westralian derelict.
Originally the co. held 264 acres, but it sold 96 acres to
the Fingail Reefs Extended for £lOO,OOO in paid-up
shares, and 96 acres to the North Fingail Reefs for
£lOO,OOO of which only £2500 was cash. The North
Fingail prospectus contained five reefs 1 % to 4ft. wide,
according to Bewick, Moreing and Co., the monstrously
celebrated experts who reported on the property. The
Fingail Reefs Co. “ recognised ” they had four principal
lodes, one of which was worth gold per ton from a
width of sft. of solid quartz. At the meeting of the
G.F.R. Co. in London, on 27th Nov., the chairman, with
tears in his eyes, said the parent co. had given back to its
puppies all the vendor’s paid-up shares, and also to the
North Fingail Co. the machinery on its ground. As to
their own reefs, the G.F.R. chairman spoke to the effect
that they had all failed to come up to expectations ; in
fact, the show wasn’t worth working. So the Great
Fingail apparently sleeps with its fathers, or at least is
getting its clothes off with a viewjto doing so.
Lady Shenton, Menzies (W.A.) : Month’s

The London chairman on the great future of
the Bulong Mining, Tramway and Ore Reduction Co.:
“We have four channels through which to earn money.
The Last Chance mine is situated close to others from
which very rich stone is being raised. As to the Queen
of the Lake, there is said to be a very fine outcrop of a
very strong reef which may be traced on the surface for
some distance. We have ordered a tramway four miles
long and a 20-head mill. You are aware that without an
adequate supply of water, batteries cannot be run, or
human life sustained. Happily, we are very favor-
ably situated. Although I hesitate to say our supply
is inexhaustible, Mr. Fearby says, ‘At the present time
there are millions of gallons of water on the surface.’ lam
confident that you will never be short of water for all
milling purposes, no matter what plant you may erect.”
Fearby doesn’t hesitate, and has proved himself a most
accomplished Westralian boomster. How much water on
the surface of the lake now ? This concern has a working
capital of £25,000 to work mines, build a tramway, and
run a public crushing plant in W.A., and the amount pay-
able to the vendors for their rights is £lOO,OOO in cash and
shares!
* * * *
From a reliable London authority to The Bulle-
tin : —“ A regular dry-rot seems to have set in over
Westralians. There are no phenomenally heavy declines,
but a gradual and persistent dropping away of values, and
no support is forthcoming from the big houses who
engineered the boom, and, some of them, the slump as
well. In most cases quotations are purely nominal, with
no dealings. The public are simply choked with shares,
both here and on the continent, and will not subscribe to
any new issue till they can relieve themselves of their
present holdings.”
* * * *
Westralian output for Deo. a long way short of
anticipation -29,6530 z. About half of the 10t—14,2170z.
came from Kalgoorlie mines, and nearly the whole of this
from three or four mines the names of which every fool
knows. A few months back the Perth Mining Journal
declared that the Dec. return from the Ooolgardie fields
alone would exceed 40,0000 z. Murchison put out 87640 z. ;
Dundas comes along this time with 16oz. The W.A. re-
turn for ’96 amounts to 281,2630 z., value £1,068,805,
against 231,5120 z. last year. Compared with a few years
ago, W.A. is putting out a lot of gold, but the reflection
that even last year’s gold-product does not represent 2
per cent, on the capital of the Bull companies working in
that country is enough to indicate that a day of reckoning
must be near.
* * * *
“ I am certain that fully 75 per cent, of the
English and foreign co’s working mines in Westralia must
shut down. Some will linger longer, but the chances are
that the majority will shut up before the end of this
year.” That is the declaration of one of the most influen-
tial mining men that ever traversed the Westralian fields.
Before leaving, he himself closed down six mines. He
admits that the two big auriferous belts at Hannan’s, so
far as they have been developed, are in many respects
unequalled in the world, but their richness will no longer
help the hundreds of “cats” surrounding. A big per-
centage of duffers is expected in every boom, but the pro-
portion of “cats” in W.A. has never been reached in
any other mining boom.

Dear Bulletin.—The manager of this W.A.

From W.A. : “A phenomenal find of gold is
reported to have been made in the Mt. Margaret district.”
But the public have long wearied of phenomenal finds in
that country. No man should now attempt to sell a
phenomenal W.A. mine without having his life heavily
insured. Take the other Mt. Margaret phenomenal find—
the Queen of the Earth. They slept on that too long ;it
has been found to contain far more gold than nine-tenths
of the people who saw it expected. ’Tis said they have
taken out some £15,000 worth. The mine has been long
for sale in London, but it doesn’t come off; and the share-
holders get no divs. Bull remembers the manner in
which he was wheedled into Bayley’s after the gold had
practically gone, also the gold knobs of the Plunderderry
on which you could hang your hat, and the bitter disap-
pointment of the Wealth of Expectations, and, in the
midst of his weeps, remarks that he is not taking any
phenomenal mines at present, and probably his warning-
will descend to the third and fourth generation.

A Westralian leaseholder, asked what was the
underlay of his reef and how was she dipping, replied;
“ She is underlying towards the Warden’s Court (for ex-
emption, no doubt), and dipping towards the blanky
poorhouse.”

The miners working on a much-lauded W.A.
show are now told that their inability to see gold in the
6oz. lode stuff which they are shovelling out is due to the
fact that the precious metal exists in the form of tel-
lurides, “ which are not visible to the naked eye.” “ Tel-
luride ” is the newest excuse in the Golden West.

One of the mining guns of Kalgoorlie has been

two Bull cos., while two leading men are leaving for Lon-

The Australian Mail, London, says, if rumors

publish the fact that the last crushings did not average
4dwt>, that the mill has shut down, and that there is no
ore in sight worth working.

A London director lately came out to inspect
his company’s outside show in Westralia, and after he
had seen the barrenness of the place, and the hopeless-
looking white quartz, and the dry dam and the waterless
battery, his attention was fixed on the solitary tree that
ornamented the lease. “ I think,” he said slowly,
“ you’d better take great care of that tree. Some of the
shareholders might want to hang themselves.”

Of the half-score Victorian coal-mining com-
panies, only one appears to be doing much good, and that
one has a powerful daily “ organ ” to boom it, and a
practical monopoly of the Vic. Railway supply. The
crowds on the directorates of nearly all the Vic. coal cos.’
boards seem to have been unfortunately selected. Some
notoriously know nothing of the business. Some are
decayed boomers. Unless directors who know the busi-
ness are appointed, Vic. coal-mines, as dividend-paying
investments, look very black.

Victoria Quartz Co. (Bendigo) looks well fox
early divs. from its grand reef at 2500 ft. Small crushings
to cover expenses averaged 22J4dwt. Another 90ft. should
land the shaft well under the stone, with 150 ft. to cross-
cut. The co. has £2OOO in hand.
* * • *
The once great Shenandoah (Bendigo) is all
awry—no dividends for five months from its section of the
deep reef, which, when it left the New Chum ground and
entered the Shenandoah, seemed to leave its gold behind.
This doesn’t put roses on the prospects of the Shamrock,
just ready to break the same run of stone on the other
side of the Shenandoah.
Bendigo’s economic mine is the St. Mungo. Past
year’s stamping a shade under 6dwt. to the ton, but the
co. managed to divide 18s. 6d. per share. Plenty of pay-
able stone still to stope. Ex-div.-payer Lady Barkly is
feeling her feet again. Below the 1130 ft. level the winze
is down in payable stone, though it will take the co. quite
three months to get it ready for effective working. The
Great Southern divided £5906 in ’96. Better prospects
for this year, as the stone between the 980 ft. and 1030 ft.
levels is improving, while the crosscuts give every pro-
mise of turning up trumps.
Ulster United (Bendigo) should, with luck,
shortly cut the Great Southern reef in the 900 and 1000 ft.
levels, and, on the opposite side, it may get the London-
derry’s patchy deposit.
The Londonderry (Bendigo) is resting once
more on its smellful, skyrocketty career. Had
but a small shoot of payable stuff at 1200 ft., and
the indications of getting more golden stone are
not too encouraging. The mine is the most specu-
lative, and the crowd which fools with it is the hottest
on Bendigo. Even in the best of times the Lon-
donderry was a spec, wherein tbe amateur speculator
almost always fell in.
New Moon (Bendigo) is steadily picking out
divs. from a mass of spurs 120 ft. wide and height yet un-
known. Stone crushes a shade over 7dwt., and heaps of
it in sight. Specimen Hill, New Hopeful, New Argus, and
the Virginia Tribute (whose term expires in July, before
which the co. expects to pay 4s. on each 24,000 share) are
also profitably working a big run of spurs. New Argus
has the pick of the formation, thickening to 30ft. in its
660 ft. level, and very payable. Of the rest, the Specimen
Hill gives promise of being the most profitable.
Catherine Reef (Bendigo) for the year —48360 z.
from 13,392 tons ; £5070 divs. Spurs at 870 ft. still carry-
ing gold, but the big reef there has averaged very low of
late. However, the co. has favorable country to develope
in the 1500 and 1600 feet crosscuts; the latter having
exposed an 18ft. reef showing the color. Koch’s Pioneer
will most likely be B.’s ’97 div. champion. Breaking a
strong reef at 1450 ft., with something like 600 ft. of it to
dig out before touching the north boundary; also, for
1000 ft. above, the ground is virgin, so the prospects are
good. Besides, at 1310 ft., it cannot be long before Koch’s
grips the Windmill Hill reef.
* • * •
New Red, White and Blue (Bendigo) has done
its 100th div.; total for seven years, £125,000, and only
one 3d. call made. Deeper stone is turning out even a
better average than heretofore.
« * * *
New Chum Railway, Bendigo’s great deep level
mine, has a great future both before and behind. Last
year’s crushings, 13,535 tons for 13,2730 z. 6dwt., is a fine
average fjAm a reef at 2878 ft. Having exhausted the
rich ston_morth, the co. is now opening out at 3000 ft. to
work the southern continuation to the Eureka boundary.

At the Creenhill rush (N.Q.) nuggets are un-
known but slugs are common. Miner Hogan recently
came on the cap of the reef and dollied out 150 oz
cluding a beautiful 21b. specimen. One onlooker became
so excited that he rushed to town to spread the news and
came back to find pegs in everywhere and himself “ out
of it.”

Thus the warden re the Etheridge (Q.) : “An
enormous area saturated with gold from the surface
downwards. Has produced for the last 16 years an aver-
age of 20,0000 z. of gold per annum, and can continue the
same with the present primitive appliances for the next
50 years.” Green Hills employs about 300 miners at
present. Ravenswood has suffered through the shutting-
down of the chlorinating-works. Clermont has turned
out 11,3600 z. for 11 months as against 11,9860 z. for 1895.

Dear Bulletin, —Re a recent par. Your fears
as to the number of men likely to be “ leaded ” in the Mt.
Lyell mine are groundless, inasmuch as the big mine con-
tains no lead. The sulphur question, however, is cer-
tainly getting serious. The killing of all vegetation for
three or four miles around is a small matter compared
with the effect of the fumes on drinking-water. The
sulphuric acid combines with the zinc on the iron roofs,
and fills the tanks with sulphate of zinc. A woeful
stomach-ache is the immediate result of drinking this
water, or tea made with it. Isn’t sulphuric acid a highly
marketable commodity? Anyway, for the credit of the
company, it is to be hoped they will adopt some means of
preventing their fumes from poisoning the whole neigh-
borhood, and compelling people to take their whisky
neat-.—R.

own, the S.A. people have a pretty fair whack of those of
the other provinces. The Barrier mines produced them a
pot of money, and, so far, they have had the best of the
W.A. boom.

COMEO
In one Australian city, at all events, Good
Templary has got down into a very unwholesome
state. The last few years have been full of
startling incidents in the history of the Noble
Order. About the first of the series was con-
nected with a Worthy Brother who was about to
be married to one of the ewe lambs of the flock,
when it transpired that he had a wife living in
another province. The timely revelation broke
up his vision of bliss and he dropped out of the
Order and departed for another town where he
became a lay preacher. Then he abjured lay
preaching and became a member of a festive local
society, and started to put up record drunks which
paralysed even the inhabitants of that much-
whiskyed region, and married a bush girl, and
was short in his cash, and became mixed up in an
entanglement with a strange woman, and finally
disappeared in the night taking almost all the
assets of the township with him. It was a his-
toric disappearance, and the Noble Order has
hardly recovered the shock to this day. The
father of the deserted bush wife pursued the
levanter, but fell off his horse en route and broke
his neck.
Then a dry-rot set in. One lodge secretary
stepped out into space one fine night, taking all
the assets with him and leaving his particular
Cold Tea fraternity stone-broke. Another diddled
his lodge in a more artful fashion. It was a
wealthy lodge, which owned its own hall, pur-
chased by public subscription in the old, roaring,
affluent days, and vested in trustees. All the
trustees died save one, and no successors were ap-
pointed. The solitary survivor sold the property
for £ 2000, and never fully accounted for the
money. It had been decided that the wealthy
lodge should admit no more members, but
simply proceed to die by effluxion of time
and by rigid expulsion of all members suspected
of giving way to der-rink, and then the last half-
dozen of the Brotherhood were to wind up the
lodge and divide the assets and go out of the
Good Templary business finally. The principal
asset was the £2OOO received on account of the
hall, which sum the trustee alleged was safely in-
vested on mortgage. The scheme of winding up
was carried out —save in one particular only;
when it was near time for the final closure the
trustee and the coin went amissing in the old
silent way, and there was nothing to divide. The
lodge closed with wailing and gnashing of teeth,
and the members never gathered together in
brotherhood any more.
Then notable lodges burst up in quick suc-
cession, and sold off the assets at a great sacrifice.
One Shining Light relapsed from the faith, and,
as he was a rich man, his defection was much felt.
Another disappeared over the horizon, closely
followed by his two wives and the police. A
venerable Worthy Brother, a Past Grand Ever-
somuch of great age and vast respectability, was
found by his wife hugging a Flossie in his own
office, and the good old lady assaulted him with
a brolly in the public street to the great scandal
of the Order. She also tore most of the apparel
off the Flossie, and thereby added more publicity
to the matter. And what with embezzlements
and bigamies and Flossies and rumors of Flossies,
Good Templarism in that city is now practically
extinct.

Dear Bulletin, —You say, “ Apropos the
eternal question of the police-court Bible as a
source of infection.” Well, bury the eternal ques-
tion once and for all time. Any witness may
elect to be sworn in the Scotch manner, which con-
sists in simply uplifting the right hand. It is
within everybody’s legal right, and those who con-
tinue to “ kish the buke ” any longer will do so
distinctly at their own option, and without any
maudlin sympathy from anybody.—X.

“ The chap-

the Sydney Sun-
day Times’ pen-
lady, “ still has a

cial life. . . .

Chaperones need-
ed at picnics !
This isn’t ex-
hausting the
obvious. Oh, no
—it’s distinctly fresh, original news.
The pious Brisbane Telegraph doesn’*
publish the yearnsome advt. of the person who
wants to meet a lady with a view to “ matri-
mony,” &c., under a separate heading after the
fashion of the soulless publication that is run for
purposes of pelf. But the advt. isn’t refused ;it
goes into “Miscellaneous,” along with pills, loans
on good shecurity, horses, bricks, bicycles, kip-
pered herrings, and drinks, so it gets there all the
same. And thus does the Telegraph make the
best of both worlds and serve both mob and
gammon.
A widow living on a
small orchard not far from
Sydney lately advertised for
a husband. By ten o’clock
in the morning of the day
of publication a man, ar-
rayed in his Sunday suit,
was on the spot. At half-
past ten the man rushed out
of the house to bail up a
passing clergyman, and
offered him a pound to fix
things up then and there.
He declined on the ground
of unseemly haste, and the
happy couple adjourned to
the township half-a-mile off,
and were hitched at cut-
rates. Oil their return home
a group of smirking and ex-
pectant males, many of
them carrying flowers, sur-
rounded the cottage, and
the newly-married pair got
rid of them by referring to
a widow down the road,
mother of half-a-dozen chil-
dren, as the real advertiser.
A second marriage is antici -
pated.

Rudyard Kipling’s ex-
cellent story “ Bread upon
the Waters” deals with a
vessel’s “superfeecial crack”
(man ! it was a crevasse !)
which was known to com-
pany and captain befotfs
sailing. Wicked people are
making comparisons about
a certain Australian steamer
with a “ superfeecial crack ”
in its rudder-shaft, re which
there was a council of war
before sailing, and which
caused a Board of Enquiry
when the accident came
along.
Until the other day, when the sandy town
of Nevertire was blown off the face of the globe,
there was no record of a cyclone having struck any
Australian settlement in a serious mood. Any
number of cyclones have raged in this country,
but towns being few and small and far between it
was like gunning at a florin at two-miles range,
and the storm always missed its mark. Appar-
ently, however, things are improving. Just about
ten days after the successful removal of Nevertire
a hurricane practically removed Palmerston
(N.T.) from the map. That lone Chinese town
has hardly a building left standing. The gale
came on it from seaward, and swept away Ah Fat
and Hong Kee like Chows erected on the sand,
and a rushing cloud of dismantled shanties, Mon-
gols, blasphemy, Chinese literature, kitten soup,
and galvanised iron roofs has been blowing south-
ward towards the M‘Donnell Ranges ever since.
No one knows yet the exact amount of the dam-
age, but in a general way it seems that the only
town in the Territory may be written off as a bad
debt, or something very near it.

ginals who perished in the church show forth the
melancholy ill-luck of the tabernacle, as usual.

The cable-message in respect to the illness
of the Queens daughter, last week, was verv
awkwardly worded. It ran thus: “Princess
Louise unwell enormous.” But the last word was
part of a reference to an enormous gathering of
kahomedans at Bombay to pray for tie cessation
of the plague. The rest of the plague message
arrived later,just when the tired sub editor w!s
about to publish a statement that Louise had
swelled to six times her ordinary size.

called round to die in Brassey’s arms, and this
trouble was hardly over before another arose in the
shape of a short, stout lady named Gallagher, who
claimed to be Lady Brassey, and insisted on going
in to embrace her husband and take her rightful
place by his side. She gave the guard outside and
all the flunkeys in the hall one day’s notice to quit,
and she sacked the policeman on duty, and wanted
to knock the aide-de-camp endways. Then there
was a great struggle and much display of stocking
before she was wrestled into a cab, and she had
hardly arrived at the lock-up before she sent notice
to magistrate Panton that he wouldn’t be required
any longer, and ordered the immediate disband-
ment of the Yic. militia.

“The influence of adver-
tisement upon the personal
appearance of business men
is,” writes a Bulletin cor-
respondent, “an interesting
byway of the fin de siecle
road to success. One patent-
medicine vendor, whose
N.S.W. trade alone is colos-
sal, -wears a moustache solely
in the interests of the litho-
graphed circular. Without
it his face would not be a
household friend among those
who don’t feel well. Facial
character often, like Damo-
cles’ sword, hangs by a hair.
Another head of a large Syd-
ney emporium dolefully des-
cribes how his very best girl
capriciously insisted on his
shaving off a distinctive
beard, which would have des-
troyed the utility of some
thousands of newly-ordered
“ blocks,” and how an at-
tempt to temporise with the
demand broke off a promis-
ing engagement. One Aus-
tralian politician at least, on
being approached on one
occasion as to the advisa-
bility of having his hair cut,
is reported to have stoutly
refused _ on the ground of
betraying the cartoonist.
This is a theme which in-
vites speculation. When
once a man gets up a dis-
tinctive advt. he becomes a
slave to his “ad.,” and it
owns him body and soul.

Heart of my heart, when the dark
Creeps out of his cave in the mountain,
When Love lights a glow in the deeps of the park,
A sheen in the fountain:
While the stars whisper songs to the moon,
And tenderly tell their loves to her,
You’ll come to me silent and tremulous soon,
And at last I, your wooer,
Shall clasp you and kiss you, aflame
At the light in your low-lidded eyes, Love,
Till your swooning soul answers the passionate
claim
That in my heart cries, Love.

The Petone (M.L.) mystery is being
gradually sorted out. It started by the chopping
up with an axe by some person unknown of an old
inhabitant named Jones and his wife. The axe-
man did his deed at night and left absolutely no
clue behind him, and for a while the police went
round and arrested anybody who looked shabby
and friendless enough to fix a suspicion on to.
Then one Stephen Bosher, in a beery moment, told
Mrs. Bosher that he had a previous wife living,
and that lady told the police about mysterious
blood-stains on Bosher, and the force settled itself

down in dead earnest to disentangle the problem,
which was something like this : Bosher couldn’t
be convicted except with the aid of the second
Mrs. Bosher’s testimony. As the accused’s wife
wasn’t a competent witness, the only thing
to be done was to find the first Mrs. Bosher, to
prove her identity and gaol Bosher for bigamy,
and then, having demonstrated that the second
Mrs. Bosher wasn’t Mrs. Bosher at all, to use her
evidence in the matter of the Jones assassination
if she didn’t change her mind by then and refuse
to give evidence at all. It was a long, devious
road that led to Jones’s alleged assassin, but the
police set their square-toed boots firmly into it and
plodded along. Things are now so far advanced
that Bosher has just started doing two years for
bigamy, and then, just when everything seemed
in order, the second Mrs. Bosher fell ill, and, un-
less she recovers, the question of Jones’s butchery
may never get into the courts after all.
In one Australian capital it will shortly be
necessary to execute a Minister’s rather nice-look-
ing daughter in the interests of peace, and pro-
bably her mother also. Since the plain old man
rose to his present dignity, the remarks “My
father, the Premier, you know,” and “My hus-
band, the Premier, you know,” are dragged in so
incessantly that nothing but bloodshed can ade-
quately meet the case. At one time there was an
idea that if the two ladies were severely admon-
ished and perhaps slightly dislocated on the rack
and then branded, it might be sufficient, but the
case has now grown too aggravated for anything
short of death.
Mrs. C. C. Lance, nee
Christie Fuller, who sang
with such success the con-
tralto music of “The Mes-
siah ” at Sydney Town Hall
on Christmas night, was born
at Port Elizabeth, South
Africa, but came to Mel-
bourne at an early age. Her
father, a musical amateur of
ability, was one of the foun-
ders of the first Melb. ora-
torio society. Miss Fuller
showed marked musical tal-
ent, and when only 11 years
old, at the performance of a
cantata at Prahran Town
Hall, stepped down from her
seat in the chorus and suc-
cessfully took the part of the
contralto principal, who had
failed at the last moment.
At 15 years Miss Fuller was
studying under Madame
Christian ; at 18 she made
her professional debut in the
Melb. Town Hall; and for
several years she sang and
taught very successfully.
Tripping then to England,
after a notable farfewell con-
cert,. Miss Fuller studied for
some time with H. C. Dea-
con, and before quitting Lon-
don gave several successful
matinees and concerts under
distinguished patronage. Ex-
hibition year found her once
more in Melbourne, receiving
a “ welcome ” concert on
landing ; and before return-
ing to England to resume
her studies she sang with
Santley in Melbourne and
Adelaide. Returning to Aus-
tralia in ’9O, by way of the
Cape, Miss Fuller undertook
a musical tour through South
Africa, followed by her mar-
riage and temporary retirement from the profes-
sion. Mr. and Mrs. Lance have recently settled
in Sydney, and Mrs. Lance’s beautiful voice—a
light contralto of conspicuously sympathetic
quality—which has only gained by rest, will doubt-
less be highly prized in the local musical world.

At Cheltenham (Vic.) court, the other
day. Boy, 12 years of age, is brought up on a
charge of setting fire to his mother’s stable and
hay-shed. Pleads guilty. Doctor called as wit-
ness deposes that boy is weak of intellect. Police
withdraw charge. Chairman of Bench gravely
lectures imbecile (who is intensely interested in
watching the flies on courthouse ceiling) and winds
up with the sententious observation : “If you
look up the act, my lad, you will find you have
rendered yourself liable to 15 years imprison-
ment.” Law-bred irony, or simple, fat-headed,
ignorant J.P.-ism ?It was either one or other.
And the man who uttered it is the kind of being
who has the power to send intelligent persons to
gaol!
How is it that the alleged democratic Melh.
Age never buys a serial story which doesn’t deal
with the doings of members of the aristocracy? Is
it because David Syme knows his business better
than any outsider can tell him ? The typical ser-
vant-girl despises a yarn that doesn’t in its first,
or, at any rate, second chapter, describe how,
“ with these crushing words of scorn, the haughty
heiress of Hasheastle, drawing her queenly form
to its full height, swept proudly down the grand
old hall of her ancestors. ” Are the readers of the
Age —in the matter of literary taste —on a level
with the typical servant-girl ?

A Vic. Western district man recently tra-
velled 50 miles to Portland to drown himself.
Undressing on the beach and about to commit the
deed, he noticed some girls bathing just near him.
He redressed, took the next train back to his
village, and was found two days later drowned in
an ordinary, common waterhole. He left word
that he preferred to die in the wide, green, breezy
sea rather than beneath the scum of the local pool,
but as a gentleman he couldn’t take his clothes off
and drown when ladies were present.

111 Sydney the other day the police
besieged a weedy youth in a tree for nine solid
hours before they effected his capture, and it will
be a long time before the force gets its dignity in
working order again. The weedy person had
been stealing fruit, and being discovered he got
out on a high and very slender branch, which
wouldn’t support a “cop,” and hooted defiance.
For the best part of a day relays of police sat on
the grass through a series of tremendous showers,
waiting for him to drop off like over-ripe fruit,
while 400 small boys stood round and jeered. The
simple idea of burning sulphur under the tree and
smoking him out, or hanging a bottle of assafoetida
on the end of a long pole and holding it close to
windward of him and smelling him out, or shoot-
ing pepper at him and sneezing him out, never
entered, into the trap’s simple philosophy. There
were many opportunities for some highly strate-
gical policemen to distinguish themselves under
the circumstances, but all they did was to wait
and soak till the youth surrendered late at night
through rain and cold shivers and cramp.

The very worst push at present raging in
Sydney consists almost entirely of clerks, who
wear store-clothes and straw hats, and storm the
town to the accompaniment of a specially hideous
battle-cry of great penetrating povver. Some of
them nearly blew down one of the suburbs the
other day, and, being captured by a cop, who took
his life in one hand and his revolver in the other,
they were duly fined by magistrate Isaacs 20s. each.
One pound for nearly wrecking three pubs, and
making the welkin ring with the horrid shriek of
the push seems a very moderate figure. Moral: If
you are a larrikin always wear good clothes and a
straw “cadey,”and then, instead of being an or-
dinary rowdy, you will simply be a misguided
young gent, giving vent to his overflowing spirits.

LOVE’S LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Too late—now every mesh is closed—
I see
Love’s not the game that it’s supposed
To be.
Some hours of ecstacy each week
We know ;
But ere we scarce have time to speak
They go.
And, though ’tis Heaven while I dream
With you,
By far those honeyed moments seem
Too few;
And all the dreary hours I spend
Away,
Long Hells with no apparent end
Are they.
My days of sport, my nights of fun,
Are o’er;
The pleasures that from life I won—
No more.
The girls and pals I was so proud
To see
Are now a brutal, soulless crowd
To me.
And, where my best-loved barmaid’s eyes
And bust
Once paced my pulse, I realise
Disgust.
I m wild when fellows say she “ain’t
Too bad ” ;
To-day she seems to me all paint
And pad.
And even liquor’s not a bit
The same ;
Gone are those times we were so fit
And game.
When “ straight from stable ” tips in luck
We took,
And deep in doubles gaily struck
Each book.
Gone are those dreams in dazzling tights
And hair;
Those willing, thrilling, killing nights . . .
Somewhere.
My old-time pleasure should I e’er
Regain
To steer from love I’ll take good care
Again.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Jan. 12, 1897.
Mr Dear Myee—
The match between N.S.W. and S.A., on the
Sydney Cricket Ground, attracted vast crowds of
women—especially on Saturday—and the new
stand was vivid with hats of the most glaring and
eccentric styles: there were rows and rows of
magenta roses and puce poppies and green daisies
all a-blowing and a-growing. The suburban girl
in her thousands was there, and the evolution of
her head-gear may be traced from the show in an
expensive shop-window, crossed by a flop and a
tilt copied from Mrs. Brown-Potter’s inspirations
in curves and angles, modified by the exigencies of
the finances of the suburban home and varied by
the taste and fancy of the amateur milliner. Even
a man-reporter was moved to mild wonder in a
daily by Saturday’s hat-display. Brilliant
chapeaux were made more conspicuous by the
manlessness of the ladies’ stand. Men members
sit coldly and proudly in their own stand, and their
best girls can only gaze wistfully at them across
the wire-netting which wards off the woman’s
quarters like a rabbit-proof fence. The place
looks like a synagogue on Saturday mornings.
One or two members of the local team in
celestial blazers were adorning the ladies’ stand
during the afternoon. The crush in the tea-room
was evidently unexpected; there were not too
many waitresses, and customers had to sit
patiently hoping for a cup of flabby cold tea or
sloppy coffee. In the matter of dresses, black-
and-white effects were among the smartest.
One girl, with an amateur reputation as a prima-
donna, showed some white lace over black
silk, and a bewitching hat, all black feathers
and red crown and diamond buckles. A married
ex-Melb. belle was also in black and white of a
confused pattern, and a hat like a stra w-thatched
hut. A popular warbler clothed herself appro-
priately in canary yellow. Two fair-haired sisters
had almost invisible bonnets, and proved them-
selves thereby up-to-date, for the tiny is now
toney in millinery. Grass lawn costumes of the
early spring—soiled by three months’ wear and
tear—have evidently “ gone back ” on their owners
in the wash-tub, for they have all disappeared
from best-frock festivals. A little French woman
created an atmosphere of Paris by a judicious
blend of apricot and black.
Mrs. Silas Harding, widow of one of Vic.’s
wealthiest squatters, met with a sudden death
from a carriage-accident, at Dunkeld, Vic., on
Saturday. She passed through some romantic
episodes in her lifetime. As a young girl she
earned her living in many humble ways, and finally
as canvasser to a jewellery firm she captivated old
Silas Harding, then a widower, who married her.
At first the greatest diplomacy was needed to
screw any money even for her personal wants out
of the veteran. But he died and left her im-
mensely opulent. Slighted by the local first
families, she blossomed out among the Melb.
Nicest by acquiring the gorgeous stucco mansion,
planned and oecupied for a brief time by M. H.
Davies, at Toorak. “Bracknell” has brought
bad luck to both its proprietors. It seems to be
a boom-cursed place. Perhaps it’s the moulded-
iron staircase with crimson plush hand-rail that
blights its owner. Mrs. Harding entered into her
domain by giving a large garden-party there last
Cup time; everybody went and very few knew
their hostess by sight.
Tram-ticket poker is it favorite game among
Melbourne city-going clerks. They bet on the
numbers on their tickets if the figures read any-
thing like a good poker-hand. The enterprising
sharper sometimes unlawfully gets the stakes and
the “ kitty ” by keeping about him a lucky ticket
and producing it at the right moment. Is there
any game in this world at which man doesn’t ring
in a cold deck on his fellow-man ? I have heard
of a person who used to induce guileless sports
to bet on two flies sprinting across a window-
pane, and who found out a way—l forget what it
was—of making the other man’s fly run “ stiff.”
Selling seats by auction has been seized on as a
money-making scheme by the church as well as by
the stage. The sittings in a newly-erected chapel
were thus sold, and bidding was brisk for pews in
remote corners, while those just in front of the
pulpit went cheap. Worshippers now feel that
they are not trying to get saved “on the nod,”
but, having respectably paid their way, are free to
turn out any celestially-minded deadheads who
may wander in unwittingly and endeavor to find
peace out of hymn-books and pew-cushions paid
for by somebody else.
A party of Yankee enthusiasts calling them-
selves the “ Theosophical Crusade,” hired the
Protestant Hall two nights last week, hung some
gay bunting around the walls, placed pot-plants, a
piano, and other obstructions on the platform,
and proceeded to expound their views from among
the ornamentations to a room-full of disciples,
who were all soulful-looking. The men wore
swallow-tails and long hair, and the women bare
necks, glasses, and short hair. The lady-crusaders
were bright and cute : the men looked intense and
yearning with a great sorrow welling up in their
eyes, as if at the callousness of the outer world in
not receiving with joy the universal-brotherhood
theory.
By way of showing how to love everybody with-
out reference to sex, age or color, the leader of
the movement, Mrs. K. A. Pingley, explained
that this crusade had nothing to do with the other
branch of the P.S., which was a fraud and a delu-
sion, and denounced the other leader, Mrs. A.
Besant, and all her works. Only half the society
Bets itself, figuratively, to hug the entire
universe. The bogus half is willing to hug
everybody, but the real half is only prepared
to hug everybody except the bogus half.
This is practically what the audience gathered
from the speakers, and then the room
ceased to vibrate with the ’Murkan twang, the
audience arose with a tired sigh and departed, and
the cold gloom of midnight settled down once
more on the Hall.
A discussion on “Flirtation” is now languish-
ing in the columns of Sydney D.T. On this point
the women who write don’t know, and the women
who really know don’t write. For which their
fellow-flirters are doubtless grateful. Very few
women, even of genius, possess the immoral cour-
age of Georges Sand, who used to call round in a
cab for her young men, take them off with her to
Italy or Spain, and then make a novel and plenty
of money out of the incident. But when these
learned ladies lay down hard and fast rules to
guide a frivolity-loving public, can’t you _ tell
they’ve never “ been there ” themselves ? Flirta-
tion is all right as long as neither flirter nor flirtee
is in earnest; in which case it becomes rather too
exciting to be pleasant. Many an engagement is
a flirtation doing penance*
The woman who both knows and writes is some-
times inconvenient. One with a vast field of
reminiscence has lately been attending swell
London weddings—whereat she always cries—and
has been corresponding about them freely in the
newspapers, giving personal recollections of the
bridegroom when he was young and frivolous, or
recalling mental pictures of the thrioe-wedded
bride’s No. 2, and “somehow during the service
his face seemed to come back to me so plainly and
distinctly.” Pleasant for the bride !
This week, at the Cri., the gowns are of the
greatest importance, whatever the woman may be.
Even “The Woman of No Importance” herself,
Mrs. Brough, expresses just the right shade of
sorrow in her snuff-colored frock with lace soften-
ings. A woman who had been led astray by any-
body of less rank than a stage lord should wear
seal-brown with a mere touch of frilling at the
neck. If she is abjectly repentant and left penni-
less, her costume should be of unrelieved black.
The first scene looks gay enough for a garden-
party, and the harmonious blending of the wearers’
frocks proves that somebody must have passed a
sleepless night planning to have five women on the
stage together in colors that don’t clash. Miss F.
Seymour pursues Lord Illingworth in magpie silk
much be-chiffoned and a feathered hat ; she
mingles blue and green in a low-cut dinner-
gown.
The most affluent - looking gowns are ap-
propriately worn by Emma Temple as the Yankee
heiress; in No. 1 she seems to have shipped
it green, as Kipling kipples prettily in the
ballad of the Bolivar, m billows of green
glac4 silk tulle and embroidery; No. 2, a pink
evening frock, with the latest thing in sleeves,
stands out well in an artistically stage-managed oak-
room with crimson lamp-shades ; No. 3 is white
and simple and manages to combine a loose blouse
front with a neat waist-line. Miss Kitty Hardy
makes her best point with a brilliant red sunshade
on a cream-and-red creation. Mrs. Bracy is
tremendously awe-inspiring as a British matron in
red, and the other dowager frivols stoutly in the
person of Miss Watt-Tanner.
Crowds of Sydney theatre-goers now arrive at
places of amusement per wheel. The bicycles are
deposited in various spots around the building.
In the Palace vestibule they sometimes surround
the walls. The dress-as-you-please regulations
enable the cycling woman to adorn the d.c. in all
varieties of garb except evening dress. The wheel
is not built to display a girl’s upper half to advan-
tage. To look graceful on a bicycle a woman
must only end in revelations, like Lord Illing-
worth’s “ book of life.”
An invited few turned into the Salon Cinemato-
graphe on Friday noon, while Mr. J. M‘Mahon
explained his new pieces, just arrived per R.M.S.
They are very Frenchy, and show all sorts of
things that you needn’t go to gay Paree to see
now you can see them in Pitt-street, including
horseless-car racing and Moulin Rouge dancing
(expurgated edition).
“ An Angel in Muslin ” (F. R. Peel, Sydney), is
an air that ought to become popular, for it is fairly
catchy and is wedded to immortal verse by G.
Darrell, who must have had it very badly indeed
that time. Paling and Co. publish “ The Merry
Brewer of Bundaberg ” as morceau de danse, and
exhibit on the cover a photo, of a bearded gentle-
man as a guarantee of the statement. He looks
jolly enough, but a rather substantial morceau to
tread the mazy. “ Hyacinthia ” waltz, by C. E.
Mason (Nicholson and Co.), makes its little appeal
to the Nicest by being dedicated to Hon. Margaret
Brand. “Ariel,” by Florrie Banbury, waltzes
ambitiously into four flats —too many for the
average amateur.
The new “ mind-cure ” is now expounded in a
book called “ Practical Metaphysics for Healing
and Self-Culture. ” It is rather tough reading, but,
boiled down, the meaning seems to be that health
is either good or bad, as thinking makes it so. If
you steadily make up your mind not to have a cold
in the head, then you won’t annoy your friends and
family by sneezing and snuffling at the breakfast-
table ; or you can conquer an obstinate gumboil
by abstracting your mighty intellect with a deter-
mined wrench from your mountain of cheek ; or
you need feel no grief and pain after eating a
Sydney peach, if you only think hard enough that
the green ball of concentrated ache is a soft and
luscious sun-ripened fruit. There is really one
way in which “mind-cure” would supply a long-
felt want —that is, by diverting people’s attention
from their own particular aches and pains. Listen
to the conversation of a tram or carriage full of
women. Nine out of every ten are talking about
their health or want of it.
A tombstone dance is the latest style of social
upheaval. In a N.S.W. country town the
parishioners of the leading church were exercised
as to ways and means for cleaning up dilapidated
grave-fences, straightening old tombstones, and
regilding the faded “Hie Jacets ” in the local
cemetery which had fallen into disrepair. The
elderly parson’s youthful wife suggested a sub-
scription dance, which turned out a great success,
and left a margin for renovating the family vaults
of the township, after deducting exes, for claret-
cup and ham sandwiches.
Earl Russell probably holds the world’s record
at the moment in the matter of an objectionable
mother-in-law (he has just got Judge Haw-
kins to accommodate the lady with eight
months’ gaol). A local suburban bridegroom
showed a stern determination to refrain from try-
ing to break it, by having a type-written docu-
ment drawn up previous to his wedding, properly
signed and witnessed, whereby the bride’s father
and mother bind themselves to assert no claim to
enter her husband’s house.
’97 Fashions are foreshadowed in the current
Weigel’s Journal, from which authority I le *™>
for the first time, of the existence of a mysterious
and hidden garment called “ ladies’ pyjamas.
There must be something thorough m the opinions
of a New Woman who even fashions her sleepmg-
suit with a divided skirt. Many patterns of
bicycling costumes are given, and tight-waistea
ladies simper in the latest styles of zouave jacke s
and dresses with scalloped garniture. 1 don t
know myself what “ scalloped garniture is, but
it looks ail right in the picture, and I suppose it
really is scalloped.
My Melbourne correspondent writes :
“ The first meeting of the Austral Salon for ’97,
which took place on Thursday, served as a fare-
well to Miss Nellie Veitch, who received from the
members gifts of barbaric gems and gold, much
effusion, and a silver m£(tch-box. Quite a large
number of intrepid males lurked in the back-
ground of the proceedings, one of whom was bold
enough to emerge from his stronghold and uplift
a very excellent tenor voice in a couple of ballads,
of the kind which are marked “four shillings on
the cover, and which, for some mysterious reason,
one always gets for two shillings or else three-
pence. R. S. Smythe extended his travel-limits
that evening, and visited, for the first time, the
lair of Melb. ’s intellectual womanhood.
“ The streets of this city have lately presented
an unusual and striking aspect, by reason of the
numbers of young men, obviously opulent and
cheerful, who spread themselves over the land-
scape and give to this Adamless Eden a decidedly
festive appearance. At the theatres, hordes of
them with much-creased dress-clothes and with
faces showing a good brick-dust tint above their
boiled shirt-fronts, clatter noisily out between the
acts, and become sleepy and inattentive before
the entertainment is over. Shipping-lists, showing
that over a thousand men are leaving the golden
West almost every week, give an explanation of
the influx.
“Society has not left this dusty city for the
mountain or sea-side in very large crowds this
year. A great number of the ton are still mer-
cifully left with us, and graciously condescended
to shed a faint, diluted lustre on each day of the
cricket-match, and to lend something like dis-
tinction even to the bicycle races at St. Kilda. A
field of raoing cyclists on a fine day, in their gaily-
colored silken jackets, rather pleases one’s aesthetic
taste, but the cyclist per se is an unbeautiful ob-
ject. Parsons, ui his neat “ suit of sable ” and
his compact, nuggety figure, sits rather grace-
fully and makes a pleasant picture while
racing. The invalided Bilmartin spread-eagles
all over his machine, and is not pleasant
to watch from a feminine point of view. Porta’s
f raceful fashion of entwining silken scarves round
is waist and bewreathing his face in smiles
whether he loses or wins makes him popular with
girl spectators and might be imitated advan-
tageously by other riders. The new English rider,
Relph, looks careworn and anxious over his race,
like one who regards it as a most serious and im-
portant thing.
“The shipping strike caused a wild exodus of
humanity in print frocks and flannel suits from
the fashionable seaside spooning resorts. On the
Sunday, when the Ozone went for what was
thought to be its last trip, the boat was rushed by
a crowd of about 2000 returning holiday makers,
with luggage attached, and a considerable number
of these were people who, in the ordinary course,
would prefer death to travelling on the Sabbath.
“ Miss Alice Muskett, the sister (not the
daughter, as sundry papers misstate) of Dr Mus-
kett, after touring Holland, has decided to settle
for another year in Paris, where she will probably
start a studio ‘on her own.’ Miss Muskett, by
birth a Melb. girl, owes all her art training to
Sydney.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.

Dear Bulletin,—You sav, “the man who
goes out cychng in a top-hat probably has but one
hat. More probably he is afraid to give himself
away in any other style of headgear. With many
men, the top-hat is absolutely essential to a
character for “ respectability.” Substitute for the
orthodox pot a soft felt or a straw (which is the
severest test of all), and those wooden-faced repre-
sentatives of a particular commercial school would
be undone. You remember the ponderous Patri-
arch in Little Dorrit.” When his long hair was
clipped short, children fled from him in horror
There are many heads of city firms whose appear-
ance would get them six months, as the savins
goes, if they were compelled to wear a flat-rimmed
boxer or straw. They arise at banquets and attri-
bute their precious “ success in life ” to all sorts of
causes save the real one—the top-hat—but they are
quite conscious of their weakness, nevertheless
Hence the dislike of city potentates in generai
for all men who go about their business in head
gear better suited to the climate. They feel them-
selves mocked and put to shame.—Clan Alpine
Bimerah Station (Q.) has just put up a re-
cord in Australian artesian boring. The bore has
gone down considerably over 4000 ft., and, having
thus established a record for depth, is still descend-
ing in search of the yet-unfound water. The bore-
casing is sin.
Quite a large number of contributors to
Australian Xmas numbers were surprised to re-
ceive a small shoal of begging letters immediately
after their tales appeared in print. The late
Lady Brassey reports, by the way, that the
amount requested from Lord B. by begging letter-
writers in the course of a year or two was over
i 11,000,000. In the present case the inky mendi-
cants evidently formed a very erroneous idea of
the amount of wealth which streams in upon the
author of a Xmas tale. As a rule, after he has
mollified his hash-tower woman with something on
account, the sum that remains is about enough for
one drink —a very ordinary drink, too.
Captain Goddard, a patriarchal mariner
who retired from the sea the other day, is cele-
brated as having voyaged from London to Sydney
regularly for 41 years, without once being led
astray into visiting other ports. Every year since
1855, this veteran has steered some sailing vessel
or other into Port Jackson and out again, and in
all that time he has never lost a ship, or met with
a serious accident, or cost the underwriters any-
thing. No other shipmaster has haunted Sydney
so persistently. Captain Goddard is aged 61, and
was born on January 26th—that great occasion
when the first Australian was officially lagged—
which circumstance established a connection
between him and this country from the very
beginning of his existence, and now he proposes
to settle down in Sydney and die there comfort-
ably when he happens to feel that way.
The Mundic Miner, Georgetown (N.Q.)
reports the doings of a recent church raffle up in
that forlorn region. “ One of the features of the
show is a bridal bed warranted to hold two. The
married ladies are contributing towards the ex-
pense of getting up this haven of future blissful
memories. The mode of disposal is original, for
no one is allowed to buy a ticket except bachelors,
and each one must get a spinster to throw for him.”
The soulful hug of the church comes out strongly
in this idea. Nobody except a church would think
of offering a bridal bed as a prize and raffling it
under such blushful conditions. But the taber-
nacle always has an eye to business. The winner
is almost bound to marry the giggling maid who
threw for him, and then the church will scoop in
the fees. No ordinary person could publicly win
a bridal bed without being harried into matrimony
very shortly afterwards.
A tragic love-episode, which reads like a
slab from some short French story, ocourred in
Little Lonsdale-street, Melb., last week. In that
fragrant locality lives one Ah Hing, a cabinet-
maker, and his frugal residence has been shared
for the last five years by a white girl, now 23 years
old. Until six weeks ago Ah Hing and his inamo-
rata lived an ideal existence. They loved each
other with the fidelity of a Romeo and a Juliet—
until the adjoining Chow brought home a big, fat
helpmate of about 40 summers. The Amazonian
proportions of his neighbor’s lady appealed to Ah
Hing, and very shortly his own girl caught him
making violent protestations of love to her through
a crack in the back fence. Mrs. Ah Hing that
ought to be broke her heart there and then over
her faithless Chow. She drank sixpenu’orth of
belladonna, then told her erring lord all, and lay
down to die. But in the face of this awful situa-
tion Ah Hing repented ; he burst into tears and
begged forgiveness at his idol’s feet, promising
never again to look at the huge creature next door.
Then the police came, and the girl was stomach-
pumped at the hospital and afterwards locked up
for attempting suicide, while her loving idolator
wept all night outside the lockup, and filled the
air with heartrending cries for his “ beau’ful Maly
Ann.” Even Little Lonsdale-street has its
romance now and then.
Spectre of my weak-willed, lost, soiled heart
Silent glide in the gondola, ashen, empty as thou
art,
A skeleton shame; a memory adrift on a sunless
sea,
Where slowly wanders the sluggish tide totvards
Infinity.
ATHOS.
THE OLD LIFE AND THE NEW.
Sir Turner, now you knighted be, -
No more a democrat,
Those pants, so baggy at the knee,
That ancient honoured ’at;
Those awful boots and greasy ties
Henceforward we taboo ;
Their part is played, the Queen has made
Another man of you.
Shut your eyes, and droop your head.
Whilst we whisper—“ Turner’3 dead.”
Sir Turner, tilt a topper bright
Upon a haughty brow,
And point your “ patents ” left and right
(Bid Chirnside show you how);
And sell the famous suit of tweeds
For ninepence, to a Jew ;
Your title needs, in duds and deeds,
Another man of you.
Fold your hands upon your breast,
Like a pilgrim gone to rest.
Sir Turner, get with smarter togs
Dear Duncan’s dreamy smirk;
Devote your time to rolling logs
Instead of vulgar work.
Lay in a stock of Tory fibs,
And swear they all are true.
God save Her Nibs, who nobbled Dibbs
The way she nobbled you.
’Twas, alas ! a painful end.
Good-knight! dear, departed friend.

It will be interesting to note if Turner’s
luck goes out with his knighthood. So far he is
recognised as about the most successful Premier in
Australia ; he has steered the country through the
V°. rst years of the depression when Patterson,
ohiels and Munro all failed ; he has wrested more
concessions from the House of 48 Landlords than
any of his predecessors managed to do, and he got
them, not by any sensational row, but by silently
pegging away and wearing down the fossils with
sheer exhaustion. In the regular order of things
iurner should now fall over some unexpected
disaster and go right under politically; or he
should be found out in his hitherto concealed
iniquity ; or he should get swelled head and begin
to foregather with Sargood at champagne banquets
and maunder about the British Flag. If nothing
dreadful happens it will be directly contrary to all
the traditions of K.C.M.G.-ism.

WHAT AN IDEA!
THE SERGEANT : “ The prisoner, yer Worship, is always pestering strangers

The gruesome account of the rescue of a
man named Hugh Williams from a derelict the
other day recalls the extraordinary train of cir-
cumstances connected with that name as chroni-
cled m the Admiralty Records. The first instance
harks back to 1684, when the Menai was lost, the
t° i^oJ being a man called Hu S h Williams.
Jin 1785 a schooner went ashore on the Isle of Man.
1 he brokers dLsgorgcd only one man, and he was
entitled Hugh Williams. In 1820 a picnic boat
was run down on the Thames, and out of the 25
corpses resulting only one cheated the coroner by
coming to life again. It was another Hugh
Williams And in 1889 a Leeds coal barge foun-
dered with nine men on board. This time there
were two Wilhamses (both Hugh) in the case, and
both were fished out, wet but spry. The talis-
manic virtue of a caul appears to sink into insig-
nificance compared with the advisability of being
baptised Hugh W. previous to entering upon a
maritime career. Possibly Jonah’s real name was
W llliams.
“ARMY AND NAVY

A certain well-known Vic. squatter told
the following recently at a fat-man dinner-party :
I once played a good joke on a yokel that I
met out on the run. ‘ Any sport, mate, ’ said I
quite friendly like. ‘Only a few mushrooms,’
said he.. I admired his gun, and he let me look at
it. ‘Nice cut of a dog,’ said I. ‘Best in the
land, he said, ‘ been offered a tenner for him.’ I
pulled the trigger and his dog was cold meat,
then I covered him with his own gun and made
him dance on the mushrooms, and with a
shot over his head I started him on the fastest
run for the fence that he ever did in his life. By
Gawd you would have laughed.” And then his
fellow hogs did laugh unanimously.

Australia also when he had it out here with him—
it that was it.
A London correspondent reports that the
partnership between Dr. Maloney and the hairy
healer Professor Richard, has broken up The
capillary one has disappeared, and Maloney is now
running a healing business of his own with no
great success. It takes a very agile liar to make a
success in that line of business.
Even on his death-bed Julian Thomas was
careful not to disclose his identity. As the end
was drawing near, a lady seated at his bedside
(one of his oldest and best friends) asked : “ Have

It is already known that Justice Boucaut
who, prior to his elevation to the bench in 1877*
was several times Premier of S.A., has been re-
commended for one of the K.C.M.G.-ships to be

brated next June. Horn, who sent a scientific
expedition to the M‘Donnell Ranges, and who
is rich enough to have ,650,000 locked up on fixed

Solicitor-General in Patterson’s time he so nearly
upset Bryan O Loghlen’s scheme for whitewashing
the boom-bank crowd without a trial. The Jews
probably dislike him because of his Usury Bill. The
lories in general object to him as a Democrat, and
the Democrats view him with suspicion because
there is no case on record where so beautifully
dressed a Hebrew remained faithful to Demo-
cracv. If the Democrats could meet Isaacs in

There has been a good deal of doubt during
the last fortnight as to the actual whereabouts
of the Premier. When anyone inquired at the
Treasury they were told he had gone to Victoria.
It seemed to be a point of honor with the offi-
cials to be mysterious as to Mr. Reid's exact
whereabouts and the length of bis holiday. He
did manage to let himself be seen at the inter-
colonial cricket match in Melbourne, and then
vanished into obscurity again. The “Argus” has
discovered him, or at least one of its correspon-
dents has. This is what they say about him:—
“Our Lome correspondent telegraphs that Mr.
Reid, Premier of New South Wales, is at
present staying at the Grand Pacific Hotel there,
and has booked' his rooms for some time. Mrs.
Reid and one of his two children, who accom-
pany him, have been ordered to the seaside for
a change, and Mr. Reid has chosen Lome, where
he has stayed before, and which is a favorite
placs with him. to afford them the change de-
sired.” >

CONGRATULATIONS.
“Sir George Turner’s public career has been a brief and highly successful one. He is still in the prime of lifr and he has filled the offic of Premier of the colony
for more than two years. If sumo surprise is foil at the distinguished honor conferred upon him, it arises solely from the fact that he has given no indication of an
ambition for personal distinction other than that which necessarily springs from the important position he holds. Nevertheless, his many friends will sincerely con-
gratulate him upon this proof of Her Majesty’s favor. "— ARGUS.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Vic. State Land Bank, the second
institution of its kind in Australia and the third
in Australasia, opens for business in a few weeks.
S.M. Herald, as a Foreign-trade paper,
rises continually to point out that Foreign-trade
makes better and cheaper goods than Protection.
This is theory. And the paper the Herald is
printed on comes from New York because Pro-
tection makes better and cheaper goods than
Foreign-trade. This is practice.
The syndicator is very much abroad in
S.A. The scheme for a land-grant transcontinen-
tal line is never at rest; and now John Moule,
ex-Works Minister, desires to plank down a de-
posit in connection with a scheme for a land-grant
railway from Port Augusta to Esperance Bay
(W.A.), and is very wrath with Premier Kingston
for declining to even look at his proposals.
Vic. Opposition is now only a plaything
for fifth-rate Scotchmen. Old Scotch Gillies
dropped the sceptre and it went to Scotch
MTntyre, and Scotch MTntyre now thinks of
passing it back in an off-hand manner to Scotch
Gillies again. The Australian element in the
party counts for very little, and Duncan and Jock
and Jock and Duncan settle things between them.
The Maoriland election trouble is simmer-
ing down gradually. At a northern police-court a
man and his wife were run in as long as ten days
after the poll for fighting about the rival candi-
dates, and a policeman was prosecuted for illegal
arrest of both parties. Also, a Wellington State
school-teacher was called upon by an infuriated
parent to “please whack Smith’s children for
throwing stones at our children all'along of poli-
tics, they being for Mr. Stout while our family is
for Mr. Hutcheson.” The teacher declined to
“ whack Smith’s children,” and a complaint was
lodged against him, but he was duly exonerated.
They take their politics rather seriously in Maori-
land.
In Sydney, last week, a particularly brutal
rowdy who had deliberately jumped on a man’s
face when he was down, was severely lectured by
Johnson, S.M., for his fiendishness, and sentenced
to two months’ gaol without the option. “ Subse-
quently, on the intervention of Mr Dalrymple, ”
Johnson, S.M., gave the prisoner the option of a
£5 fine with 21s. costs. The scandal of magistrates
reducing sentences to oblige some irrelevant person
who gets up in the Court requires to be suppressed.
Either the first sentence was altogether wrong, in
which case Johnston doesn’t understand his busi-
ness, or else Johnson is a weak respecter of per-
sons who diverts the course of justice to oblige
Dalrymple, whoever Dalrymple may be.
The two Dederers, recently convicted of
the murder of an Asiatic hawker in a back-block
region of N.S.W., were almost wholly illiterate.
The two boys charged with the murder of Phillips
at Cassilis (N.S.W.) are also almost wdiolly devoid
of education, and if they should be convicted their
case, like that of the Dederers, will be set down
by the usual illogical parson to “ our Godless sys-
tem of education.” Such cases always are so set
down, and herein the parson’s want of logic is
more than usually glaring. The apparent trouble
in the Dederers’ case was that they had missed the
blessings of Godless education —to all intents and
purposes they had no education at all—and if it
was their illiteracy which led them to crime then
the inference is that a reasonable amount of God-
less education would have saved them.
A. Heron-Wilson, M.L.C., of Queensland,
on a recent visit to Sydney, was interviewed by
the Herald on the subject of Federation. The
following is an extract from the hyphenated one’s
account of how the Brisbane Government feels on
the subject:—
The bulk of the Queensland people are not in favor of
Federation. . . . Queensland knows what she has
attained through her independence, and fears that by
Federation she may give up a great deal of that inde-
pendence. . . . With regard to Central and North
Queensland there is no doubt a number of people would
go for Federation on any ground to enable them to get
the separation from Southern Queensland they have been
asking for so long.
The beautiful logic of it. South Queensland is
against Federation lest it should lose part of its
“ independence.” Its independence consists
largely in refusing Central and North Queensland
their independence. Brisbane politicians so love
and value independence that they are willing to
burst up United Australia to get it. Yet when
the North asks that it should also have this in-
alienable blessing of liberty the answer is that
Brisbane will see it dashed first. Evidently the
liberty which the South is so afraid to sacrifice is
simply the liberty to refuse liberty to the North.
Consequently the South is against Federation
because it wants independence, and the North is
in favor of it because it also wants independence
—of a different kind.
Brisbane (Q.) Telegraph complains that
the term “Westralia” is “newspaper patois.”
Yes; it is Bulletinese. And it is “going to
stick,” just as “ Maoriland ” has done for the
islands awkwardly christened “New Zealand,”
and as “ province ” has done in place of the Hing-
lish grotesquerie, “colony.”
Yic. Civil Service numbered
25,981 employes in 1891, and only
20,489 in 1896. The number of
State school teachers has increased,
but in every other department there
has been a huge decrease.
A DAY OF MOURNING.
“ If my first wife had lived, we'd have been
married twenty years to-day .”
“ My dear, you cannot deplore her death more than I do!”
Vic. Legislative Council, with its usual
desire to monkey with things for no visible reason,
exempted butter-factories from the operation of
the Factories Act. The butter-factory employe is
probably the hardest-worked and worst-paid toiler
in the province, and strange stories are in circula-
tion about the foul and germy places wherein
Victoria’s glorious cow-fat is constructed. By all
accounts, the butter-factory wants regular inspec-
tion quite as much as any other industry, but
Sargood and Job Ham apparently like their bull-
grease dirty rather than otherwise.

brown ruin is charged 6d., so the Protection
amounts to 3d. a gallon. This matter has often
been ventilated, yet there is no stated intention
of amending or repealing that Act. The doctrine
of Freetrade seems fuddled on the question of beer.
If the Westralian railway authorities can’t
run the railways to the satisfaction of the public
and prevent numerous accidents, they can cer-
tainly lay claim to being the inventors of a most
novel system of settling claims against the depart-
ment. If an importer of pdU de foie gras is a case
short and makes a claim for his loss, the railway
authorities, having a large stock of chairs on hand,
save any bother with the pdtt de foie gras man by
handing over a couple of chairs to satisfy his claim.
The chair man in due time discovers he is short
and makes a claim which is duly settled with a
cheese or two, and the cheese man is pacified with
a present of somebody’s lost luggage, and so on.
Now that P.M.G. Duffy has started on a
six weeks’ trip to Maoriland, a Vic. Cabinet
committee will “look into the administration of
the Postal Department.” The committee must
prepare itself for shocking sights and awful
smells.
Still the cry goes up in the Maoriland
Tory press that “the days of Sed-
donism are numbered.” Consider-
ing that the Stagnant Party’s
minority now looks like 15, it has
evidently learned to be thankful
for very small mercies.
In Tasmania, since the retrenchment
disease set in, the same man fills many parts. The
Usher of the Black Rod is also Clerk Assistant to
the Leg. Council and secretary to the Minister of
Lands, and follows the musical profession in his
spare time. Another man is associate to all the
judges, Curator of Intestate Estates, chief clerk in
Bankruptcy, and a boss pedestrian as well. As even
these economies failed to square the finances, the
Braddon-Fysh Gov. knocked off taking the Age
in the Parliamentary reading-room on the score of
economy.
No. 2.—800 k Canvasser (springing apparently
out of the ground) : “ Allow me to take your
name for ‘ The Complete African Traveller,’
now appearing in monthly parts and sold
only by subscription, containing maps, sur-
vey-charts, portraits of explorers with a
record of their discoveries, views of principal
cities, and a in short, it is a complete and
exhaustive guide-book to every square inch of
the Dark Continent. It is to run through
seventy-five parts, but as it is to be paid for
on delivery you won’t feel it. What name,
please ?”
Dear Bulletin,— Premier Nelson (Q.) i s
kept in his place of power by fear, and not by
love. He is not liked personally by the majority
that is subservient to him. He does not want to
hold on to the Premiership ; the followers don’t
want him to hold on because of their love for him
but “the party” is afraid to risk what might
happen if he resigned Who is to succeed him?
l ozer ? Tozer is disliked and distrusted by nearly
all sections, and hated and abhorred by the Labor-
party and all who ever have need to placate
Labor voters. Tommy Byrnes ? He is disliked
by many, and has been “ chucked ” by the metro-
pohs ; he is regarded as an upstart and dicta-
tonal, and his anti-gamblmg bigotry has classed
him with the hypocrites. Also, with Nelson
away, Byrnes and Tozer, according to nresent
hghts would be flying at each oth*er?td
For the rest, there is a choice of “impossibles”
or noodles Nelson himself has filled present
ambitions, has wealth enough to « see him out ’’
and wants to “quit work.” He would like the
Presidency of the Council, but Palmer wont
resign, and so the matter hangs.— Yours, Ux.
During a recent all-night sitting in Tas.
Assembly, Attorney-General Clark took off his
boots and dreamed in his socks on a bench, and
Gill, M.H.A., snored heavily beside him. Some-
one called the chairman’s attention to the row,
but he refused to interfere. “ The. remarks the
hon. member who is asleep,” he said, tartly, are
quite as much to the point as those of the hon.
member who unfortunately remains awake.”
Fully £288,000 has the Q. Govt, spent in
trying to make Terrible Townsville a port, and at
present one arm of the breakwater is in ruins and
passengers are placed on coasting steamers by
tenders, barges, punts, and similar primitive appli-
ances. And poor little Bowen, with its glorious
harbour, the true port of the North, is peacefully
slumbering a few leagues down the coast, waiting,
waiting, waiting for the death of the log-rollers or
the Trump of Judgment.
Premier Reid has been again gazetted as
Solicitor-General of New South Wales, in the
absence of Attorney-General Want, who is some-
where in Tasmania or Maoriland. But Solicitor-
General Reid is also absent in Victoria, where, it
is said, he proposes remaining some time. In the
absence of both the A.-G. and his understudy, who
refuses to prosecute the influential offender or
pursues Crick with a warrant ? Does the alleged
offender wait until Jack Want is done fishing, or
what happens ?
In the stormy days down south, when the
Vic. revenue grew shorter every half-year, the
Sydney morning journals pointed to each decline
as another of the inevitable results of Protection.
Now Victoria has a big increase in revenue while
N.S.W. has a heavy fall, and the same papers say
that but for Protection the Vic. increase would be
much larger than it is, and that the way the pro-
vince bears up against the evils of a nefarious
fiscal system is really wonderful.
Opponents of Vic. Factories and Shops
Act, including even some local employes, are
raising a doleful prognostication that wages will
be brought down because more hands will be
needed. The fallacy of such ideas appears when
it is remembered that every extra employe required
tends to raise the wage for the whole body by
making men scarcer. Within certain limits the
more work is got out of the average toiler the
lower his wages will be; if he does two men’s
work then he leaves the other man unemployed,
and the other man is driven by necessity to un-
dersell him for the sake of employment.
Only a few people remarked that the
energy died suddenly out of the Vic. postal enquiry
just when some revelations about a certain secret
society seemed imminent. Experience shows that
the Ancient Buffalo or Cheerful Cherokee in office
generally helps on his fellow Buffalo, and lends a
willing ear to his complaints, and winks at his
misdeeds, and supports him through thick and
thin against the man who isn’t a Buffalo or a
Rechabite, or whatever it may be. Yet this
aspect of the matter is seldom inquired into,
probably because the Order is so widespread that
the inquiry as often as not is conducted
by some of its members.
The Victorian idea of levying a
duty on imported coal has roused the
Sydney Freetrade press to ask with indig-
nation if this sort of thing promises well
for Federation. The Bulletin reckons
that it does, if the proposal is only carried
out. Supposing Victoria levies a duty of
2s. 6d. a ton on coal which is N.S. W.’s
chief export to the adjacent province,
then N.S.W. has an inducement towards
Federation worth about <£loo,ooo a year,
seeing that Federation will abolish all
interprovincial duties. If Victoria doesn’t
levy the aforesaid duty, then the induce-
ment is entirely absent. The one thing
that would do more for Federation and
unity and brotherhood than a 2s. 6d. duty
on coal is a ss. duty. Also, as a means
of pushing along the great cause of nation-
hood a 7s. 6d. duty would have valuable
points about it.
Even the Vic. House of 48 Rich
Landlords moves a little now and then.
It amended at least half the valuable pro-
visions of the Companies Bill out of exist-
ence, but the clause prohibiting directors
selling their own properties to their own
companies got through. Considering that
a whole lot of the most awful boom
“banks” were simply formed to “take
over ” the boss director’s property at his
own valuation—the boss director conduct-
ing . the negotiations with himself and
paying himself out of the depositors’
money—this at least helps to close up
one huge swindle. Twelve months ago a similar
proposition was put before the House of Sar-
good and Cornelius Job Ham, and bounced out
with ineffable scorn. Turner’s policy of pegging
away with Job-like patience isn’t wholly without
its reward.

Alex. Montgomery’s Bulletin stories will
be issued by George Robertson and Co. in a week
or two, and subscribers who send Is. 9d. to this
office will have copies posted immediately on pub-
hcation The title of the book will be ‘Vive-
Skull Island and Other Tales of the Malay Archi-
pelago. _ As a story-teller, Montgomery has no
AuBtral ri a - : he has the ma nner of the
born craftsman and his matter abounds in vivid
interest. The Bulletin, which is proud of having
introduced many good writers to the Australian
public, is especially proud of Alex. Montgomery?
Charles Hardie Buzacott, formerly of Rock-
hampton (Q.) Bulletin, Brisbane Courier, and
half-a-dozen more white and other colored ele-
phants, has now become part owner of Rockhamp-
ton Argus, and has changed the name of that
Ttf " and " SO d P ap f, r to the d aily Record.
1 he Record now goes in all it is worth for Central
Queensland separation, and its remarks concerning
South and North Queensland are about equally
forcible. Considering how much Buzacott must
have learned concerning the many boodle Govern-
ments of Brisbane during his sojourn on the
Courier, and also considering how many things
he judiciously didn’t mention concerning these
Governments in his Courier days, he should have
a lot of awful truths to relate now that he has trot
away from under the Ministerial shadow.
A policeman may look a large, imposing
mass of brawn and a tower of strength in an
emergency, but in some circumstances he is as help-
less as a child. About 1 a.m. the other morning a
Melb. publican s wife had a disagreement with the
old man and speedily reduced him to subjection
with a stick. There were only the two of them in
the house, so when he was suppressed she had
matters m her own hands. Then she solemnly
took off all her clothes, and, going into the bar
proceeded to smash the stock-in-trade generally!
Ihe husband fetched a policeman and gave him
the needful instructions, and the officer marched
into the ruined premises to take the devastator
into custody. He took in the situation and fled
covered with blushes, and flatly refused to go in
again. Then for 20 minutes or so the constable
stayed outside, and implored Mrs. Public-house
through the keyhole, to dress herself like a good!
reasonable woman, and come out and be arrested ;
and the lady laughed and smashed things joyously
and swam in grog. Finally, an elderly married
constable was procured, and he ran in backwards,
carrying a counterpane, and effected the capture!
If that married constable hadn’t been available it
would probably have been necessary to swear in a
posse of special policewomen for the occasion, or
else to lock up the bar and starve the lady into
her clothes and a more moderate frame of mind.
Apropos Butler, is there any real reason
why a Sydney detective should be sent to London
to obtain extradition papers in the case, or is he
simply having a fly-round for the good of his
health ? Some years ago a- N.S. Wales public
servant cleared to ’Frisco by sailing-ship with 800
sovereigns, proceeds of a cheque which he had
been given to change. By the first American
mail-steamer detective “ Joe ” Camphin was sent
to intercept the fugitive. Joe arrived at the
Golden Gate many days before the sailing craft,
and captured the levanter without any of the elabo-
rate British frill adopted in the present instance.
Another instance, more-or-less to the same effect:
Many years ago, when Thackambau reigned in
dusky glory in Fiji, a Melbourne man, of Hebrew
origin, fled from that city, leaving many heavy
creditors lamenting. Fiji was then the refuge of
such folk, and Melb. merchants determined to stop
the game. They chartered a special steamer —the
Balclutha^—and sent over private-detective Otto
Berliner, with a Victorian warrant, backed by
Chief Justice Stawell. Berliner waited upon the
king (most of the white people sided with the de-
faulter, and rendered no help), and, after a lot of
persuasion, got him to “back the warrant” in
certain royal hieroglyphics. Armed with this
document, Berliner hunted amongst the islands
until he found his man. A certain amount of
loose shooting ensued, but, aided by a couple of
half-naked native constables, the ’tec got his man
to Levuka, then on board the steamer, and brought
him back triumphantly. The delinquent went to
Pentridge for a long term, and intending ab-
sconders had to look for another haven.

On a subject of absorbing interest to many
people afflicted with 66 nerves ” :
sn? a e t« BULLETI i?’ - L' Re “ s P ecu ' u m,” on insomnia: I may
speak as one who has suffered as much from that inflic-
as ;l ny ' )ne j k pow or ever heard of. Once, for eight
T wohl “dlWhta I got not a moment’s sleep ; then,
1 went mad; had hallucinations both of sight and hearing,
and yet was seemingly right in other bodily functions, and
f s *° n jf or absorbing brain-work was adminis-
tered the hallucinations were temporarily under control.
aad ,° n hv present, so to speak, in gasps. What may be
gathered from the following experiences : A moderate
dose of alcohol has sometimes sent me to sleep. A
saturation of alcohol has often sent me “dead to the
world. Again, a moderate dose of alcohol has often kept
me ndgetmgly awake ; a saturation of alcohol has some-
times kept me so fiercely alive as to necessitate prolonged
violent exercise. Chloral hydrate, with bromide of potas-
Slum, taken in incredibly large doses, has often promised
sleep almost to the verge of drowsiness, and then kept
me agonisingly awake with fearful head-pains ; in small
doses it was of no avail at all. Hydrochlorate of morphia,
and all preparations of opium, ditto. Subcutaneous in-
jection of morphia (generally the sulphate) always acted,
sulphuric ether answered everv time it was tried which
however, was not more than half-a-dozen (the other trials
number by scores, barring the injections, which were
only by surgeons). Chloroform— mouth of the bottle laid
u a , ~s <r c o , .? n outstretched tongue (doctors say it
should have killed me) just laid me out for a dozen hours.
Sulphonal, which I have lately been obliged to take at
intervals, acts generally, but slowly; it has, however,
failed on some occasions. I agree with “ Speculum” that
the chief point to gain is to secure “nervous stability”
with a tolerable exemption from distractions,” and that
d P osll p on .” (of the head) makes “ little difference.”
Re other physiological eccentricities : I know a patient on
whom coffee acts as a purgative, while tea acts as an
astringent. I know another on whom tea acts as a laxa-
“*v®> nd coffee t’other way. After all, the differentiation
of living beings brings us always back, in any such con-
siderations, to the old, vulgar proverb, “ One man’s meat
is another’s poison.” To which may be added—“ What is
meat to one to-day may be poison to-morrow.”—D.
Wooden legs somehow do run in families.
In the British Medical Journal (Sept. 26) Dr.
Spurway gives the fracture record of a single
family in Tring, Herts. J. C. (great-grandfather)
broke his ribs. T. C. (grandfather), between 2£
and 16 years old, broke his right thighbone once,
both bones of both forearms once, both bones of
left shin twice, both bones of right shin three
times—ls fractured bones in less than 14 years ; a
few years back a cow gouged his left eye out, but
bar that and a slight twist of one arm he is, at 65
years, hale and hearty. J. C. (father) up to date
has broken both bones of both forearms, both
bones of both shins, both thighbones (10 fractures)
and dislocated an elbow. Of his six children,
four have gone in for the fracture business up to
date. M. C. (16 years) has broken both bones of
right arm in two places, both bones of left forearm,
ami left upper arm in two places—B breaks. H. C.
(15 years) scores fractures on both thighbones,
upper arm and a toe—4 breaks. H. 0. (12 years)
records a broken collarbone only, apparently
having not yet taken to the business seriously.
E. C. (a 14-year-old girl) is top-notcher of this
generation, having broken both bones of both fore-
arms, both collarbones, both thighbones, left
upper arm twice, right upper arm once—ll
broken bones. If she lives to the allotted three-
score and ten she should score 55 fractures, and
certainly should have a memorial tombstone
erected by the local surgeons—unless she is a lodge
patient.

A travelling Australian to The Bulletin :
The Anglican parson, or some of him, seems to have a
real good time in this world. I stayed nearly five weeks
at the lake of Lucerne, and a fortnight at the Lago
Maggiore, and used the lake steamers nearly every day.
It was never my luck to travel on them without meeting
C. of E. parsons. Often there were half-a-dozen aboard.
At Stresa, about the prettiest place on Lago Maggiore, I
counted at the best hotel (they always go to
the best hotels) one short of a dozen. There were al-
ways two or three in the train. Well-clad, well-fed, and a
darned good hamper whenever the train didn’t stop long
enough to get a square feed at a station. And apparently
not one of these fire-escapes was a teetotaller. Now, I
hope lam not an irreverent man—l have all my life tried
to believe in something, and, being unable myself to find
a soul-satisfying creed, envy even the superstitious street
beggars whom you see prostrating themselves before the
stone saints in the cathedrals. The smug, matter-of-fact
worldliness of these clergymen astounds me. The audacity
with which they wallow in luxuries and cast to the winds
their Saviour’s doctrine of self-sacrifice is absolutely won-
drous. If I could only believe as they profess to believe,
how gladly would I try to live on apples and maccaroni,
and how small would be my concern about the shiny
seams of my old coat! Great God ! what a field is there
everywhere in the world for the man who Believes and is
therefore prepared to work for others without thought of
the morrow !

When chloroform was first brought into
British surgical practice fifty years ago, an en-
lightened clergy protested against its use in mid-
wifery cases, as being an attempt to evade God’s
curse upon all daughters of Eve. According to
the good book (which is the secret of Hingland’s
greatness) a woman is doomed to take her interest-
ing events as they come, and every shriek uttered
under the circumstances confirms the terewtb of
the Scriptures, even as a rainbow in the sky
proves beyond all doubt that the Lord gave Noah
a promise not to drown the world any more. This
was quite clear to the parsons and ladies of 1846,
consequently chloroform for child-birth sufferers
had to be justified by some sort of antidotal quo-
tation from the Book. Dr. Simpson reminded the
church that Adam was put to sleep by his Creator
prior to the removal of his historic rib, and al-
though this was rather irrelevant reasoning,
seeing that Eve wasn’t apparently put to
sleep when little Cain became due, it suf-
ficed to satisfy religious scruples in general.
Or, rather, it gave the hardshell believers
pause until their Gracious Queen settled the
question by graciously consenting to be anaes-
thetised at the birth of number eight baby. Then
the archbishops and bishops felt sure that God
doesn’t care whether a female on the verge of
maternity has a dreadful time or otherwise.

WAHOO VICTORIOUS.
Old Parramatta Road, Forest Lodge,
Sydney, 11th Dec., 1896.
Manager Loasby’s Wahoo M’f’g Co., Ltd.,
171 Rent-street.
Dear Sir,— l have suffered from Indigestion, Dys-
pepsia, and Heartburn, together with fainting fits, for
the last five years, and have tried several so-called
cures without getting relief. I have also been under
the treatment of six doctors, but without effect. See-
ing your advertisement of Wahoo in the papers, I
thought I would try it, and, though not expecting it
would do me any good considering my age (63 years),
I found your Wahoo simply marvellous. I had only
taken a few doses when I got relief, and now feel in
better health than I have for many years.—Yours truly,
(Sgd.) F. HIGGINS.

Factors of Longevity.
Can one predict the probable duration of life?
Inherited tendencies, habits, occupation, obser-
vance of sanitary and hygienic laws, and care to
promptly avert the first approach of symptoms of
disease, have a direct bearing. A long and active
life is attainable to most of us. If the liver shows
signs of torpidity, or the kidneys are allowed to
become weak, no time should be lost. Warner’s
Safe Cure has proven curative even in advanced
so-called “ incurable cases.” If used at the incep-
tion and approach of the disease, a few doses
effects a cure, enlivens the liver, checks the diffu-
sion of bile, and stops the irritation of the kidneys.
This is not alone the claim of the vendors. It is
the testimony of those around you who have tried
it and who know. Mrs. C. W. Richards, in a
letter dated Dec. 5, 1896, Hotham Hill, Murphy-
st., Melbourne North, writes : “ Some time ago I
suffered from jaundice and liver trouble. Having
consulted medical men and tried several remedies
without success, I made up my mind from what I
had heard about Warner’s Safe Cure to give it a
trial, and am pleased to say that after taking
three bottles I was completely cured, and have
much pleasure in recommending Warner’s Safe
Cure to any one suffering as I did.”*

The heroes of the cricket-match—S.A. v.
N.S.W. —won among them 218nobblers of Wolfe’s
Schnapps—the proprietors of that noble beverage
having offered 6d. per run for all over 50 made by
any individual player in an innings. In the re-
sult, Garrett scored the cash equivalent of 81 nob-
blers ; Kelly, 58; Giffen, 54 ; and M‘Kibbin, 25.*
The Boston shower-bath falls like three
inches of rain on* the dusty and undusty, and is no
less grateful to the red pores of the Coolgardian
than to the black ones of the man who voted for
Tommy Byrnes at Warwick. It is the ideal bush
bath, since you merely insert the end of a pipe in
a bucket of water and work the handles and the
machine does the rest, while the water can be
saved in case it is the only bucketful about and
the subject wants another bath to-morrow.*
The Fowler bicyles now on view at the
Australian agency, Messrs. A. Hoffnung’s build-
ings, 171 Pitt-street, Sydney, represent the latest
scientific development in bicycle construction.
The Fowler truss frame is an ingenious innovation
for strengthening the machine while preserving its
lightness ; further strengthening is in the special
reinforcement of the fork crowns. While the
stability and wear of the machine is thus ensured,
its colorings and finish amount to little less than
art. Another important element is the perfection
of the running gear ; the Fowler being called
by its riders the easy-running bicycle. It weighs
just over 201 b., is fitted with Dunlop tyres, costs
£22 10s., and is guaranteed for 12 months. The
Fowler is shown to good advantage at the com-
modious premises at 171 Pitt-street. Here, too,
all bicycle sundries and necessaries are plenteous,
varied, and up to date. One particular welcome
contrivance is the safety oiler which, costing Is.,
will prove a perfect boon to the Australian world
a-wheel.*

Cabled news that the British Govt, is much con-
kerned about a leakage of secrets from the British naval
and military departments didn’t arrive in time to serve
as an advt. for “ One of the Best ” at Melb. Royal. But
the wily Bland will be able to collect some pars on this
subject from the London papers, in readiness for the next
time Cosgrove sells “plans of the fortifications” to the
French agent in the top’at. Meanwhile, the capture of
the unpatriotic person who is revealing things would add
several hundred pounds-worth of topical interest to
Holt’s property.
It is interesting to hear that “ Skipped by the Light of
the Moon ” caught on around the English provinces, ana
that George Walton intends to send two companies out
with it next season. All these years has our old friend
Gourlay been wearing the piece threadbare in Australia,
when he might have Obadiah Dingled to his great profit
beyond the seas. “ Skipped,” when one comes to think
of it, was the first of musical, farcical comedies, horn
somewhat before its time, and never treated here on the
smartest musical comedy system.
Hairy little Zelman, who batons the orchestra at
Flemington races, is said to know more Arabic than any
other man in Australia.
Mahlstick : “Through a compromise with Mrs. Grundy,
some high-dried lady beef is supposed by the Melb. art-

Melb.: “There is a Sleepy Hollow called the Athenaeum.

The “ Chinatown ” song,.“ Cynthia, Cynthia, I’ve been

“ Professor Martin was a nice old fellow,
Full of cant and piety.
Till one night he fell a-kissing
Of his servant fair and free.”
The Chinese are solid on the realistic drama. An opera
performed recently in Castlemaine (Vic.) had one scene
wholly devoted to a confinement case, the hero being
born (he had to grow up gradually in the next 63 acts),
with much travail. After the event the happy, heavy
father seized the infant, a fully-dressed wax doll with
long red hair, and waved it triumphantly amid much
Chinese applause.
Honolulu has adorned itself with a big opera house, so

Sims Reeves, according to the latest reports, is timed

“ Matsa 1’ will probably be produced in Sydney at

“ Matsa ” has no real claim to be called a pantomime.
There isn’t a fairy queen in it.
Fanny Liddiard talks of “ Chinatown ” Hoyt sending a
company out to Australia every year, which is a rather
appalling possibility. One hopes, at any rate, that his

bought ’em at auction.
THE OLD GIRLS.
Where do the old girls go
That we knew in our younger time?

Or gone to another clime ?
Or are they marching to and fro
In the Xmas pantomime ?

A hypnotic trance exhibition put up not long ago at
Chester (Eng.) had a bad termination. The professor put
his subject to sleep and announced that he would remain
absolutely unconscious for seven days. As usual, he in-
vited all and sundry to inspect the patient as much as they
liked, and a party of sceptics took up the contract. They
arranged themselves in relays so as to keep a constant
watch on the slumberer night and day, and they played
nap in his room for eight solid hours without him turning
a hair. Then, with the hope of getting at him through
his thirst, they drew sundry corks. Next they sang comic
songs with a view to making him smile, but the subject
was Scotch and showed no sign. Finally they sat round
and told undressed stories to each other, and, towards
the end of the twelfth hour, the sleeper suddenly got up,
and bashed the narrator of the moment on the nose, and
proceeded to sweep the party off the premises. The pro-
fessor burst in just then with a revolver and threatened to
shoot all and sundry, and the subject scrambled hurriedly
back into bed and apparent unconsciousness. Finally a
policeman dragged the committee of inspection off the
professor, and the difficulty ended in the police-court.
Nigger-humorist Horace Bent was once knocked down
by a cab in Castlereagh-street, Sydney, but escaped quite
uninjured. Rising, he ran for four blocks in vain pursuit
of the cab, which was making a hurried retreat. “ You
needn’t be so anxious to have him arrested,” said a friend
when Horace gave up the pursuit; “ you’re not hurt.’
“ I didn’t want to arrest him,” replied the breathless
Bent; “ I only wanted to ask him what he would charge
to take me to the hospital.”
Alma Grey’s sister, Pearl, lately touring N.S.W. as

An English dramatic critic suggests that the “legiti-
mate” drama dropped out of fashion along with legiti-
matedrinking. In the palmy days of “Hamlet” people
swilled quarts of stout, port wine and gin and water in
which there were “infinite potentialities of tragic emotion.”
Now they sip claret, and prefer light entertainments.
Mrs. Kendal wrote an insulting letter to a newspaper-
man who had passed remarks on the neglected condition
of her brother, Tom Robertson’s, grave. The postscript
was particularly painful—“ If you publish this letter, send

where I shall be next week (otherwise I should not see it),

“ The Mikado ” is far and away the most valuable Gil-

isn’t “ phenomenal,” and if it isn’t a good one the B.M.

that the first-nighters didn’t arise and denounce the

The somewhat erratic running of Bloodshot,
Homespun, and O’Trigger has moved Melb. Spobtsmah to
remark that “ under the circs, it is probable that Powers
acquaintances, profiting by experience, will in future
back the Flemington trainer s horses only when the stable
money is not on.” Of late the outside punters have paid
very little attention to tales that trainer Power didn t
fancy his mount. O’Trigger for the Bagot Handicap, for
instance, was a pretty general public belief, in spite of
the prevalent stable whisper.

Treason, a sweet filly by Trenton-Sedition, won
a little event at Moonee Valley (Melb.) last week, and one
of the dailies “explained” the sudden improvement on
Treason’s running of the previous week by the fact that
she had then been rather short of work. The filly s lack
of condition accounted for her starting at any price on
that occasion. Seven days later she had “come on to
such an astonishing degree that she went to the post a
red-hot favorite. Treason’s dam, by the way, won a New-
market Handicap.

Queensland form must be bad indeed for the
crack sprinter. Archie’s Daughter, after running in-
differently at the Randwick meetings, was unplaced on
Saturday last in a Welter at Canterbury (N.S.W.); whilst
another champion, Babel, who was an utter failure when
in Sydney, has been equally unsuccessful in his Mel-
bourne trip, as he was a good last in a Welter at Flenung-
ton, after running nowhere in the Standish Handicap.
Yet these two animals have carried thumping weights in
watch-breaking times in their own province. So much

The M.L. two-year-old Gold Medallist (Medal-

not only easily won the Great Northern Foal Stakes at
Auckland, beating his more fancied stable-mate, the flying
Multiform (Hotchkiss—Formo), but he afterwards suc-
ceeded in winning the valuable Royal Stakes, in which he
defeated the crack three-year-old, St. Paul (St. Leger—
Satanella).

On New Year’s Day two much-fancied candi-
dates for last Melb. Cup were returned winners— viz.,

Doubtless when betting commences on next Melb. Cup,
these two will once more help to fill the bags of Mo & Co.

Mathematically, the odds are 3699 to 1 against
anyone naming winning double, Newmarket and Austra-
lian Cup—and yet Ikey Mo, in his generosity, offers the
munificent price of 100 to 1. It is nearly that odds against
anyone, at this stage of the game, spotting the winner of
the Newmarket alone, nevertheless the fatuous punter
helps to fill the bag by backing his fancies at the above-
mentioned ridiculous price. No wonder Ikey drinks
“ fizz ” whilst the punter contents himself with tangle-
foot, when things run to it.

That many a boundary-rider and stockman be-
strides an undiscovered Oup-winner has ofttimes been
said, and, to give support to the saying, every now and
then a red-hot provincial is sprung on the metropolis.
The latest wonder brought to light is Merloolas (pedigree
unknown), who recently won the double at Charters
Towers, defeating, amongst others, the sensational V.R.C.
Leger winner Cabin Boy. His party has entered the
aged gelding for Newmarket and Aus. Cup, so it will soon
be seen whether he is a second Bungebah or a fraud.

At a Vic. suburban race-meeting an amateur
iockev with more than the usual want of amateur ability
anded a nice little bet with a prominent cash bookmaker
over the race immediately preceding the hunters steeple-
chase in which the amateur was to ride. On applying to
the Man of Yells for his money, he was asked to wait for
it until after the next race. The punter consented
readily enough, the bookie being rich and solid “ Wot
did you balance him for, Ikey?” asked an astonished
brother in bags, when the creditor was out of hearing

The Wellington Park (M.L.) yearling sale this
year was a very successful one. Twenty-five youngsters
fetched 2725 guineas, thus averaging 109 guineas. A full
brother to Daystar (Castor— Cissy) topped the list, being
sold for 440 guineas, but perhaps the best bargain was
secured by Mr. Mossman, of Queensland, who bought the
brown filly by Cuirassier—Ouida (dam of Strathmore,
Hazel, etc.) for 290 guineas. She should turn-out a flyer.
“ Donovan delighted Australia ” ran the words
of a London cablegram, intending to indicate that the

delighted with the manner in which the Irish Home Rule
proposals have been received in Australia.”

Snipping from a Melb. report of the Vic. v.
S.A. match —“Just as Harry went in there was a rumble
of thunder, and rain commenced to fall, and as the
thunder increased and a rain storm was impending, they
left the field for a time. The rain proved to be but light,
and did not last more than five minutes, but for all that,
the cricketers remained for over twenty minutes in the
shelter of the pavilion. When they did take the field
again they had only ten minutes play before the luncheon
interval.” What fun for the spectators !

All this newspaper talk re Capting Trott’s
action in the matter of the “follow-on” rule is very tire-
some. The rule was there, anyway, and Trott served two
cricket purposes by taking advantage of it. He saved his
side from the possibility of being beaten by the weather,
and he ensured a couple of innings for each side, which
means a long game. The great aim of interprovincial
cricket is a long game. Outside of the newspapers there
is very little furious rivalry between teams whose leading
players have been members of the same Australian Eleven.

The S.A.-N.S.W. cricket-match, played at
Sydney, was won by N.S.W. in one innings, with 11 runs
to spare. S.A. went in first and shaped very badly
against Howell’s bowling, making only 159 on a perfect
wicket. Next day, Saturday, the big audience of 15,000
people helped to brighten the play, and N.S.W. piled on
runs till the last man retired at 420—though Jones’s
thunderbolts had commenced the innings with 4 wickets
for 9. Garrett and Kelly were the big N.S.W. scorers,
with 131 and 108, and M’Kibbin shaped well for a useful 75.
S.A. did a little better in tbe second innings,
but not much ; and the 250 scored were not sufficient to
send the N.S.W. batsmen out again. In spite of a lame
leg, Giffen managed 104, but, taken all round, the crow-
eaters gave an unsatisfactory exhibition, and Jones was
the only man who showed something like first-class form
in any branch of the game. The present makes the fifth
consecutive win for N.S.W.
* * * *
The veteran cricketer, Tom Garrett, has taken a
hand in more interprovincial matches than any other
player, past or present. The last match played by
N.S.W. against Victoria completed his 31st appearance as
a representative of the former province. He thus beat
Blackham by one match in first-class interprovincial
cricket. Tom, like his sturdy old father, takes a lot
before “ getting knocked out.”

is that they were foolish to take anv part in such an ill-

Boxing, which appeared to be on the up-grade
in Frisco, has had a sad set-back over the Fitzsinimons-
Sharkey affair. From the accounts of the fight it
appears Fitz. played with the sailor for seven rounds, and
then sailed in during the eighth and knocked him out with
a left hook on the jaw and a right body blow, whereupon
the referee gave the fight to Sharkey on a foul. The
matter was at latest in the law courts, Fitz’s party having
stopped payment of the certified cheque for £2OOO which
represented the stakes. Australian Billy Smith, who
trained Sharkey, turned “ dog ” on his party and gave
some very interesting evidence in the courts, which, if
true, shows the whole affair to have been a conspiracy to
rob the auburu-haired one of the stakes. Fitzsimmons’
"'ail of “ I have been robbed,” when the referee gave the
fight to Sharkey, is stated to have been most pathetic, as
anyone who remembers Bob’s struggles in Sydney for
anything from a crown upwards may imagine.
Billy Smith swore in court that Sharkey told
him after the fight that Fitz. could beat Jim Corbett in a
couple of rounds, as Fitz. could “hit like the kick of a
mule.”

On Saturday M'Murtrie’s 22-footer, Effie, con-
tinued her winning career by annexing the Johnstone’s
Bay Sailing Club's 22-footer race, off scratch. Effie
started with a small suit of sails, but even that handicap
could not hold her back, and she made the third of an
unbroken list of wins. Some score of years ago Joe
Donnelly built for Mr. S. H. Hyam a 22-foot skiff, named
the Effie, but better known as the flat-iron, which com-
pletely ran away from everything of her class, or out of
it, and it looks much as if Joe’s last creation is going
to take after the old-time craft in performances as well
as name.

Wray, the sculler who went to England with
Stanbury, was an unsuccessful competitor in a sculling
handicap on the Tyne, won by W. Haines. The johnny-
know-alls used to say that Wray was very little, if any,
behind Stanbury .as a sculler, and as Wray has now
challenged Harding to row for £2OO a-side on the Thames,
there is a chance of learning how good he really is.

In England they are disinclined to credit
Roseingrave’s Australian jump-records. The young man,
before he left ’Ome, was reputed to have done big things
in the wilds of Connemara, yet could not come near them
even in Dublin. In Melbourne, he could not do nearly as
well as in Sydney, and in Sydney he did nothing very
extraordinary. Roseingrave’s biggest jumps appear to be
done in remote places where no one in particular is about,
and they are not so much seen as heard about afterwards.
When Happy William and Converted Jane
give forth their “testimony ” at the street corner,
most people take it for the spontaneous outbreak
of the soul. It looks like that, but it isn’t. The
testimony, in most cases, is elaborately and pain-
fully rehearsed beforehand (the writer lives next
door to a tambourine temple and speaks with
authority). Far into the night sometimes, in that
house of din next door, does Converted Jane
struggle with her part without salary or liquid
refreshment, making alterations and additions at
the bidding of the stage-manager, adding lurid
experiences, and working up her attitudes and
her tears and the set of her poke bonnet and her
hair. It is a hard, nigger-driving contract, and
by the time the wretched, ill-fed Jane has got her
little tawdry speech all right she is ready to drop
from sheer exhaustion, and is almost inaudible.
Even the sewing woman or the waitress hasn’t a
much harder life than Jane when Bhe is in her
novitiate.

Inarticulate, bubbled in gasps of death.
S® S *P ope , d down lower ; no sounds came now,
Hut the blood-foam lay on his cheeks and brow.
Macalister’s camp lay by north and west:
was a four hours’ ride to a man hard-pressed.
wn thr f, e hours ’ sun had not fired the air
There b blood-branded came staggering
The horizon was nigh, for the noontide glowed
hen Macalister’s party for Murgill rode.
But the black creek timber showed over the plain
xtre Macalister tightened his bridle-rein
And looked out hard on a spot that he knew
W here the pme-ridge bristled against the blue.
Then, or ever a man of them turned or spoke
1 here crept through the pine-trees a wisp of smoke.
Kach thought of a woman, what fate was hers ?
And handled his rifle, and fleshed his spurs.
Through the crashing scrub, up the clogging sand,
Ihey rode like devils with heel and hand.
Through the choking smoke and the fire-drift hot
Ihey flashed like madmen who heeded not.
On the ashes of hope, in the grip of fate,
Ihey halted like mortals, just all too late.
There were wild, swift seekings through crackling
flames,
There were anguished shoutings of tender names.
When the mother and girls were together laid
There were deep oaths pledged to be fully paid.
The boy stood out in the blackened ring
And the men looked down on him shuddering.
His father’s blood on his brow was dark
As a fire-brand’s blaze on a sapling’s bark.
And his lips were sealed as by deadliest drouth
With the kiss of his mother’s fire-charred mouth.
Baptised in blood and confirmed by fire,
His whole soul dark with one fell desire.
Two days passed by ere they rode again,
The boy in the van of a grisly train.
But no books tell us what then befel,
For the tale of that riding were bad to tell.
And bad and sad is the whole tale known
Of the boy who led it from shout to groan.
Of the boy and the man as he still appears
In the reddest page of the Gulf’s worst years.
They blacken him still in their cackling talk—
The pitiful, preaching new-chum folk.
But some men listen to all they say,
And stand by him still in the back-block way.
“ For I say,” says Macalister, bursting through
All the babble and prate of the half-baked crew,
“ That if ever a mandate to be obeyed
On the soul of a mortal man was laid
“ ’Twas on him, and ’twas sealed in his life’s
eclipse,
On his father’s blood, by his mother’s lips.
“Those black, scorched lips, could he feel their
kiss,
And ever his life’s sole purpose miss ?
u ’Twas to kill and to kill, and in killing pay
His debt to the devils the proper way.
“ He is dead, God rest him, and all his tracks
Are marked with bones of the cursed blacks.
“ And my own mind’s clear, had he lived right out
The days of the prophets ye preach about,
“ His oath would have held till his course was run
And his hate kept hot, as it ought to have done.”

Earthworms are proved by experiment to
carry up tubercle bacilli from buried tuberculosed
flesh. Tuberculous meat was buried at the bottom
of a deep flower-pot, in which several earthworms
were kept. Six months later the worms were in-
oculated into guinea-pigs, which promptly suc-
cumbed to tubercle. The bodies of dead worms
also contained bacilli abundantly. Another reason
for cremation.
The recent wreck of the Delmira off the
Maoriland coast should give another fillip to
nautical superstition. The vessel was originally a
Spanish slave-trader, and on nearly every voyage
in her later years she encountered bad luck of
some sort. Last trip but one the Delmira was
months overdue, the skipper’s wife and the mate
were seized with typhoid, the crew took scurvy,
provisions ran short, and finally a serious breach
occurred between skipper and men. The sale of
the old slaver’s bones realised exactly one guinea.
The “ cocaine bug ” or “ cocaine worm ”
otherwise a hallucination in cocaine-taking cases,
which makes the expert think he is full of
worms which crawl out of the pores of his skin
and out of clothes worn by himself and others
(but, curiously, not out of freshly-laundered clothes
or clothes not in use) —must now be supplemented
by “ Magnan’s symptom,” a symptom in advanced
cocainism in which the sufferer fancies that his
skin is full of sand, crystals, or more or less
rounded pebbles, all of which are continuously on
the move. Medical cocainists fancy they are full of
wriggling microbes. Even continued use of cocaine*
dressings in surgical cases may produce these'
horrors.
Dear Bulletin, — In reply to “ X.Z.,” who
asks whether cannibalism survived in Scotland 1
till the days of Queen Bess, etc. After the English
invasion of the 14th century, the inhabitants were
reduced to such straits that cannibalism became
rife. In the commencement of the 17th century
the cannibals were exterminated barring only the-
notorious human-flesh-eating family of Sawney
Baine, consisting of eight sons, six daughters, and
32 grandchildren, who lived on the coast of
Galloway. They were all wiped out by the gory
arm of the law save one infant girl. But before
she reached her twelfth year the inherited craving
for man-meat broke out, and having ferociously
bitten a boy playfellow and eaten the piece ex-
tracted, she was burnt to death for the crime of
cannibalism. In the forests of Brazil the descen-
dants of the deserters and stragglers of the old
Spanish conquerors are eating human flesh to this
day. — Bony.

-Now that doubts are expressed whether
the supply of india-rubber can keep up with the
manufacture of pneumatic tyres, Australian
Govts. would do well to foster the cultivation of
the caoutchouc, or india-rubber tree. Much of
the world s india-rubber is derived from Borneo,
and experiments have already proved that the
plant will thrive in the warmer parts of Australia.
North Queensland would lend itself specially to
the industry; so would most of the Northern
.Territory and Northern Westralia. There are
immense possibilities in the business which should
be worth all the profits of the struggling butter-
trade twice over.

“Some few years ago I suffered
terribly with indigestion and gen-
eral debility. I could not sleep,
and my condition was such as to
make my life miserable. None of
the many remedies I tried did me
any good, and I despaired of ever
getting better. One of my friends
told me of the blood-purifying and
strength-giving properties of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and I began taking it.
Before 1 had finished the first bottle
I felt better, and was thus encour-
aged to give the medicine a thorough
trial. In all I used four bottles,
and then was perfectly cured of the
grievous trouble which had afflicted
me. I now recommend, to anyone
suffering as I did.

A religious paper reports that “Some-
where on the west coast of Africa there stands to-
day a native Kerristian church (erected by the
converted blacks at a cost of .£2000) close to the
site of a heathen temple which had walls mainly
composed of human skulls.” How very sad ! The

wooden-god-fearing creatures who went to Heaven.
And their descendants, for certain, are mean,

Dear Bulletin, —Being connected with an
Italian firm of standing, I have necessarily to
give what assistance I can in the way of explain-
ing any little matters which may not be perfectly
clear to the understanding of the Italian com-
munity here. The following will show one
side of the business in the matter of the registra-
tion of birth of an Italian child: —
Copy of Official Memorandum from Registrar of Births
and Deaths. (Exact transcription):—
x O.H.M.S.
No. 1/b. District Registry Office,
7th July, 1896.
Memorandum
from District Registrar at
To Guiseppe .
Sir, —
I have to invite your attention
to the fact that either the particulars of the Certificate
of Birth received regarding your son Alberta or those of
your “previous issue” are most erroneous, and to the
penalty for a false statement see last clause of forms of
Certif. of Birth (£lOO and 3 years’ gaol).
In 1892 you and your wife are described as 29 twenty-
nine years of age. Your wife’s maiden name Gorge (in
reality the wife’s name was Giagi.)
In 1894 your ages are both 30 thirty years
her name Gaigan.
In 1896 your ages are both 31 thirty-one years
her name Gallagher.
In 1892 your marriage is dated 1888.
In 1894 „ 1886.
In 1896 „ „ „ ~ 1888.
Those facts speak for themselves, and prove either gross
negligence or wilful falsification.
In last certificate tendered the ages of previous issue
are not given. I have written Angelina 7 years, Emilio
2 years.
If that statement—your own ages as 31 years each —or
any other statement made in the certificate of birth of
your son Alberta be incorrect, then be good enough to
fill up the enclosed “ amended ” statement correctly,
making the information, if correct, of your birthplace
Walli di Signori and Josnelo, and place of marriage
Sorbo biano, as it will save too much alteration in my
register, as those particulars are also differently given in
previous information, but may be only a variation of
geographical description, and so may still be correct.
By the time I had finished the interpretation of
this awe-inspiring document, and thoroughly
explained the terrible clause in certificate of birth
referred to, the miserable Guiseppe quaked with
fear. He said, “I am a poor mana, and never see
one hundred pounda in my lifa, but you tell that
Govment Magistrato I can give hundred pounda
sweet potatoes, suppose very good all same. Per
Baccho ! ” I continued to explain that if the
money were not forthcoming he (Guiseppe) would
have to go to gaol for three years, whereupon
Guiseppe :“I think very good. Mr. you
write Magistrate and say I no time go gaol, too
much worka slaughteryard. I no belonga this
countree ; no understands. Grazie !! you tell
that Goment Magistrato gobloh ell! ’ ’ —Vlako.
Many a traveller approaching the mining
township of Lionsville, Solferino (N.S.W.) gold-
field, has gasped in astonishment when the
battlements of Ugilbar Towers came in view.
Ugilbar is certainly one of the finest homesteads
in Australia, and, although in the heart of the
bush, all the surroundings and appointments
savor of life. A large staff of servants is required
to keep the place in order, although the members
of the household are few. The house has been
built many years, and was only compiled after
long delay and many tiresome law-suits. The
labor was done by Germans, brought straight from
the Fatherland, who had signed an agreement for
a certain time at the appalling rate of £8 per year
and tucker—with no prunes in the cabbage-soup.
Finding, after their arrival here, that they were
working at far below current rates, many of the
kraut-eaters deserted their employment, thus
causing the importer a deal of trouble. The
owner of the place—he took up the virgin country
near 50 years ago—recently died, and, in accord-
ance with his dying wish, an old aboriginal who
had been all his life on the run, followed the coffin
as chief mourner. The deceased, in his will, made
provision for the nigger during his life. So Queen
“ Wittoria ” will not be bothered with appeals to
“ gib it blanket ” from that quarter.

genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
y Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice ; the
very fact of their having been before the public
tor so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office
which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
tor these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
m the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public bv
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W. A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ? ” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth. I

At public functions in Westralia—the land
of the great uncouth—the reporter has a bad time.
He is treated as a sort of cross between a club-
waiter and a coachman. At banquets, he is
stowed away at the worst end of the table, or
placed at a sideboard, near the dirty dishes, with
nothing to eat or drink. The latter matters little,
as the imported turkey and working-bullock, to-
gether with the gooseberry champagne, have no
great attractions for the average pressman. The
treatment, however, meted out to the two reporters
who did the opening ceremony of the Leeuwin
lighthouse,'at .which the Premier —the boss cur-
mudgeon of the west —and a number of pro-
minent Perthites were present, completely rips
to ribbons all previous records of discourtesy.
The contractors for the lighthouse were Davies
and Wishart, members of the M. 0. Davies com-
pany, who have a huge concession from the Govern-
ment in the vicinity in the shape of the best bit of
karri timber-country in the world. On the arrival
of the Premier and party at the home of the com-
pany (Karridale), the' members were taken under
the well-fe ithered wing of one of the numerous
family of Davies, while the two pressmen were
bundled off into a back kitchen, where they were
told by the cook they had to take their meals and
sleep. The press is of mighty little account in the
West as yet, but it is growing in importance, arid
some day it hopes to make the Six Families wish
they had never been born.

OUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-'
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be,without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession 1 had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment bad failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. 1 tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Heariie’B Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

69 other leading residents.

“I have little doubt, therefore, in view of
the enormous proportion of elephantiasis cases in

blood, that further investigation of the adult
population will bring out the startling fact that
practically all adult Samoans harbour filaria
nocturna, or are the subject of filaria disease. ”

At the recent special meeting of a well-
known football club, the secretary called attention
to the fact that the club’s war-cry, which had so
often spurred its kickers on to victory, was being
daily infringed by the proprietors of a digestive
tonic, and moved that application should be made
for an injunction to restrain Loasby’s “ Wahoo ”
Manufacturing Co., Ltd., from making use of the
club’s war-cry, “ Wahoo.” The company, how-
ever, claim an unquestionable title to the word,
and allege that a mere football shriek, unless
registered by the club, is not the private property
of the pursuers of blown leather. In the mean-
time, “Wahoo” is curing hundreds of sufferers
from indigestion, liver complaint, &c. #

THE ENORMOUS and annually increasing
quantity of OIL-CAKES consumed in the
United Kingdom, Europe, and America has
proved beyond question that a liberal but judi-
cious outlay on the part of Dairy Farmers and
Stock-feeders is money well spent. It is rich in
Oil and Flesh and Fat-formers, and is peculiarly
adapted for increasing the quantity and improving
the quality of Milk and Butter, and for Fattening
or Topping Cattle, Calves, &c.
If the Danish, French, and German Farmers
find it necessary to use this Cake all the year
round to provide firm Butter suitable for the
British market, Dairy Farmers here, who wish to
cultivate a permanent trade, will have to follow suit.
SUNLIGHT OIL CAKE
will be found PURE and of the FIRST

It is offered at a MODERATE PRICE, as

A POSTMAN’S STORY.
(From, the AUSTRALIAN STAR.)
“ I have been close upon thirty years in the
General Post-office,” said Mr. J. Sheedy to a Star
reporter, when seen at his residence, Power
Domain, last night. It may be explained that
Mr. Sheedy is a letter-carrier, who for .M) years
has stuck to his post, delivering letters in all sorts
and conditions of weather, and suffering in conse-
quence some, at least, of the results of exposure to
the elements. , , ,
“Some months ago,” Mr. Sheedy says, he be-
gan to feel symptoms of ill-health, which could
not be easily defined, and, as is often the case,
pointed to no particular complaint. A feeling oi
lassitude during the day and a sense of tiredness
after the day’s work was done, the accom-
paniment of loss of appetite,” &c. I can t say
I was really ill,” said Mr. Sheedy, “but just run
down, easily tired out, felt miserable, and yet not
ill (this is just the way thousands of Australians
who are not well and yet not exactly ill, feel).
Mr. Sheedy goes on to say that a few weeks ago he
was induced to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People, which he did, and now he is enthusi-
astic in his praise of their value. “ They are
wonderfully good,” he declared. “lam a new
man. I had three boxes, and have one nearly full
left. My appetite is better; I can do my work
better without any trouble or fatigue, and I feel
lively and well in every way.”
Mr. Sheedy assured the reporter that he had
every faith in the Pink Pills, and would take them
whenever he felt run down. Further than that he
strongly recommends his friends who may suffer
from indisposition, from overwork or from ex-
gisure to the weather to give Dr. Williams’ Pink
ills a trial.
The proprietors of this preparation do not claim
that it will cure all the ills that human flesh is
heir to, but they do claim that it will overcome
rheumatism, sciatica, headache, indigestion and
other disorders, which are the fore-runners of
serious complications. The company is in posses-
sion of hundreds of testimonials from persons in
all parts of the world who testify to the benefit
they have received from the use of Pink Pills.
The above testimony, coming from a man well-
known in Sydney, should make it very strong, for
Mr. Sheedy, although not restored from a -death-
bed, nevertheless has suffered as thousands of
Sydney people are doing at the present moment,
who are not just ill, yet they are far from well,
and they feel disagreeable and miserable and very
often there is more downright suffering than if
they were laid up in bed. Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills for Pale People constitute a perfect blood-
builder and nerve-restorer, curing such diseases
as rheumatism, lumbago, sciatica, neuralgia,
partial paralysis, St. Vitus’ dance, indigestion, etc.
They are also a specific for the troubles which
make the lives of so many women a burden, and
speedily restore the rich glow of health to pale
and sallow cheeks. Obtainable from chemists and
storekeepers generally, or sent (post paid) by Dr.
Williams’ Medicine 00., Sydney, on receipt of 2s.
9d. per single box, or half-dozen for 14s. 9d. Men
broken down by overwork, worry, or excess will
find them an undoubted specific.

“Papa’s Hair.”
'A
A gentleman has sent us the following :—“ A few
t go 1 bou ° ht a botfcle of your ‘ Papa’s Hair,’
ana it has acted with the most satisfactory results.
Previous to doing so, my hair had a mousey color
streaked with grey. The dear children would try
to count papa’s grey hairs, but, because of the
number, could not succeed. Being only 44 years
of age, I determined to improve my hair, and tried
your ‘Papa’s Hair,’ and arn pleased to. write that,
though at first there seemed little difference, gradu-
ally the hair regained its original color (there was
no dyeing whatever) and it is no w strong and glossy.
1 asked my little daughter this morning to count
“y grey hairs, but when looking for them she cried
out—‘Why, papa, there are no white hairs; mamma
must have pulled them all out.’ ”
This Preparation is not a Dye, but acts gradu-
ally on the Roots of the Hair, and restores Grey
Hair to its natural color and lustre.
No preparation will make hair grow better than
“Papa's Hair."
It effectually prevents the formation of Dandriff,
as it is called, the presence of which always denotes
diseased action in the cuticle of the scalp, causing
premature baldness, or a falling off of the hair.

a small piece of sponge rub into the roots of the

its natural color ; afterwards apply twice a week.

Most of the hotels in Broken Hill commit
daily breaches of the Licensing Act. The Ever-
lasting Thirst of the popidation of the dusty, sun-
seorched, lead-poisoned Barrier is unquenchable in
the 17 hours (from 6 till 11) allowed by the Law.
1 his is so widely recognised that the police rarely
interfere h good order is maintained during pro-
hibited hours. For appearances’ sake, a raid is
inade now and then, but warning is often given to
the hotel-keeper. If the warning is unheeded,
and a few thirsty souls have to be arrested, the
authorities either lose the note-books containing
their names, or they are fined the minimum fine,
and their names are kept out of the local paper by
the tacit consent of everybody concerned.
In most cases of eye-disease or injury the
operation of enucleation or removal of the entire
eyeball will soon be as dead as the dodo. Eviscera-
tion or emptying 1 the contents of the eyeball (as
invented by Mules, of Manchester, and Graefe, of
Halle), accompanied by the insertion in the empty
case of a round glass ball to which an ordinary
artificial eye can be accurately fitted, will drive
the older operation clean out. Complete removal
of the ball means a sunken eye, disturbance of
muscular relations, and an artificial eye with a
weird, immovable stare which attracts public atten-
tion, with consequent avoidance of society through
shyness and dislike of comment. Mules’ opera-
tion secures a retained framework, a firm round
base for the glass-eye, harmony of movement
between the eyes and consequent absence of stare.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Said the Preacher : “All is vanity 1 ’’-appending
as a reason
That the things we find our pleasure in are
bound to pass and pall;
But it seems to me that whatsoe’er endureth for a
season
Isn t half as vain as whatsoe’er has never been at
all.
When you find that what you’ve? hitherto been
wont to make a boast of
Must be numbered with the visions that from
addled brains proceed—
When you find that in respect thereof there isn’t
ev’n a ghost of
Fact to back it up-ah, then you may erv
Vanity indeed.
From my tend’rest years I’ve plumed myself on
being an Australian—
An Australian pure and simple, of the most
authentic brand ;
Scotchman, Englishman and Irishman alike tome
were alien ;
I was sibber to King Billy through our common
mother-land.
To the pride of local genesis my being was sur-
rendered ;
The worthiest of immigrants I looked upon with
scorn
As exotic interlopers under foreign skies engen-
dered,
Though transplanted to my country fifty years
ere I was born.
What though they wove the fabric of Australia’s
starry banner
From the fibre of their being till the tissue was
complete,
’Twas for us, the young, to wave it in our own
emphatic manner
In the face of all things ancient, European and
effete !
“ Ours the fittest hands to hold the reins,” I
sedulously boasted ;
. And whenever at the festive board occasion
would allow,
“ Australia for th’ Australians ! ” with a hip-
hooray I toasted. . . .
And to-day I learn I'm no more an Australian
than a Chow.
Would to heav’n I’d been content to play the
“ Native ” single-handed,
' Nor sought to be enrolled in that accursed
A.N.A. !
But the vain ambition seized me to be registered
and branded
As an organised Australian—and I gave mvself
away.
Not long to crush my fondest pride the ruthless
Council tarried ;
Yester eve I made my overtures, the answer
came at morn—
“ Dear sir, at last night’s meeting ’twas unani-
mously carried
That a person born at Battersea is not Aus-
tralian-born.”
“At Battersea”? . . “At Battersea ” ?-un-
T u °f objection
u- ! 1 , ardl y even looked at my certificate of
birth, J
vv Inch now “ Returned herewith,” brought dimly
back to recollection
A tale of my nativity on t’other side the earth.
How my mother (rest her soul !) by wayward
. appetences fretted
ried aloud for the Old Country and a breath
of English air;
ow ripe for holiday, her last caprice
And I, a mere expectancy, went with them un-
aware.
And though the self-same year in shining dells of
myrtle found me,
ere the wattle shed its perfume and the
lories flashed like gems,
And the white acacia blossoms flaked the verdure
all around me—
orn ‘ n London, on the Surrey side
ot Ihames.
Oh, vanity of vanities, the birth I made a boast
of !
Oh, unsubstantial vision of an inadvertent
brain !
And the self-confounding sentiment I made so
' ■ brave a toast of—-
Gr-r ! I jumped on my certificate . . . and even
that was vain.
* * * * «

I have slept upon the question. I have faced the
problem squarely
At the favored hour of wisdom when the dark-
ness turns to grey:
I have reckoned up “nativity” impartially and
fairly,
And I ve come to the conclusion they are fools,
the A.N.A.
If begotten of and from the soil, what lack I to be
native ?
What matter where my skin first felt the chill
of mundane airs,
If my origin was here, in this alluvium procrea-
tive
Whose substance reached me through two gener-
ations of forbears ?
That an accidental deviousness in time of incuba-
tion
Should make my Whence irrelevant, and pin me
to Whereat—•
Do they really mean to play on me with calm
deliberation
A pyramidal, orbicular absurdity like that?
But no matter. Let them hug their narrow
canons of admission:
The A.N.A. are not the only natives in the
land ;
There is yet another outlet for my virtuous am-
bition ;
I will hie me to King Billy; he will take me bv
the hand.
He will lead me to his tribe, on slight preliminary
payment;
As a resurrected ancestor my status shall be
fixed;
As a native of the natives I will rid me of my
raiment;
I will rub me with gohanna-grease and charcoal
intermixed.
111 adorn my head with feathers, and to decorate
my body
I will grave it o’er with diagrams, and fill the
grooves with clay ;
I will capture me a lubra by the suasion of a
waddy—
And who’ll be native then, my high and mighty
A.N.A. ?

J. BRUNTON STEPHENS.
When the Prince of Wales and Millais
went shooting in Scotland they took with them
old Jock M’Tavish, who was noted as the hardest
whisky-drinker in the Highlands, and boasted of
never having been “tight” in his life. Accord-
mßly* tit lunch-time the twa sassenachs arranged
for relays of brawny gillies and pipers, to drink
with the old man, fair dram for dram, until the
ground was strewed with bits of broken bottles,
pibrochs, strathspeys, cairngorms, kilts, and
boozy caterans. At last Jock himself caved in,
and was left on the heather at the side of a hill
with his head well down and his heels well up in
true Highland fashion. The party then set out to
climb the bonnie braes of Ben Nevis or Ben some-
thing else, but on reaching the top found they had
P r ®® eded by the grand old man, w ho enquired
if ony o them had a flask, as he had an unco
drouth.” Thus his honour was saved. The same
Jock, who died lately, was the art critic who
asked Millais if he had ever heard of photography,
and didn’t he think it quicker and more like to
nature than messing about with paint ?
At latest advices, the New Australians
were getting along nicely in their Paraguay home
—according to a letter from Mr. S. M‘Greer, the
settlement’s new president, “ elected on the
strength of having submitted what I consider the
most advanced platform that the most advanced
community have ever had the opportunity to
accept.’ The people of the settlement were at
the time of writing short of clothes, and the saw-
mill had broken down, and they had not the
money to put it right. The settlement now has
about 1000 coffee-trees planted; but they take
three years to bear. Sugarcane grows prolifi-
cacy- “If we had the machinery,” the writer
continues, “ with our thousands of orange and
fruit trees, this would soon be turned into the
world’s jam factory. Everybody at New Aus-
tralia is well. We have plenty of milk, eggs,
vegetables, and fruits. Everybody has fowls,
ducks, and turkeys. Our pigs are increasing
faster than we care about eating them, and every-
body’s fireplace is decorated with a ham or bacon.
There are 850 cattle on the run, and 130 horses,
and we want more people. The entrance-fee is
not yet fixed. We give all members a non-trans-
ferable share. Single girls can join free; but until
we are flusher in coin they will have to pay their
own passages. Some of those who have left have
given Paraguay a bad name, which it does not
deserve. I find it fertile, the Government friendly,
and the people hospitable. As chairman, Ido the
business of the association, and do a lot of travel-
ling on horseback through the country. I have
never been molested, and have always been wel-
come to camp at any hut I strike at night.”
The Dead-Bearers .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sixty-five tents—of a sort —and twenty-odd gun-
yahs of bark and foliage. This is the fever-camp
of Toongabbie in earliest Australia—and Dr.
Balmain is choleric and over-tired.
dhe tents and the gunyahs are on les'el ground,
and the rain is soaking, soaking, and the malarial
mist is rising, rising. The compound, which the
tents face, is a lagoon ; the tent-sites are trench-
less, but the water streams all the same towards
the ever-swelling expanse.
A drummer-boy takes his stand by the sentry
stationed at the largest tent of the encampment,
and taps the parchment five times, and then rolls
once. Again five times, and again the roll-
funereal in sugges-tiveness.
Four tattered convicts come from the rearward
of the northern line of gunyahs. They are the
dead-bearers. They plod and splash through the
lagoon.
The boy clasps his drum-sticks in one hand—
the left; and with the right withdraws a crust of
bread from his breech-pocket, and munches it.
The sentry shudders ; there is a bleak westerly
blowing, and he is chilled doubtless by the wind
and wet. Or, is the crawling of the spine due to
the presence of the escort of the dead ?
The leader of the dead-bearers takes from the
hand of the sentinel a slip of paper.
“ Seven ! Damn it ! On a day like this—
and trenches full of water ! ”
Again the sentry shudders. The westerly is
gusting again—and the marine is standing in six
inches of water and slime. However, the dead-
bearers are near.
“Them’s my orders ! ” he said, or rather whim-
pered.
Into three—four—five—six tents went the
escort of the dead by twos. From each of five
tents a solitary corpse was projected ; from the
sixth two.
The mortality was heavy; seven deaths—at
least so officially reported—to-day ; yesterday,
four ; for the seven-nights past, thirty. And the
“ strength ” of Toongabbie settlement a fortnight
ago was one hundred and seventy convicts, male
and female.
One by one through the lagoon water, over a
neck of mire, to the bordering mud of the grave
trench two hundred yards away, were the dead
carried by the slobbering, cursing, sodden-souled
and bodied escort.
The dead ?
The sixth was in the trench. It spoke : tried
to yell: it knew where it was ; the bleak wind
and the cold stream of merciless rain had re-
freshed, re-vitalised it.
“ I am not dead,” it whined.
“ God’s death ! You are dead, for the doctor
said so,” cried the leader. And from the embank-
ment of clay, a shovel-full of mud fell upon the—
corpse.
Two hundred yards away, the boy was still
munching. And was munching again when he
took the hospital requisitions from the doctor to
the Superintendent of Convicts for seven less
rations for the night than for the morning.

CHAT WITH A FAMOUS FOOTBALLER.
Mr. John Robertson, a miner, is one of the leading players in the Shettleston Swifts Football
Club. At his house at Barrocknie, near Glasgow, he told a story interesting to all footballers. He
said : “I am 26 years of age, and at the age of 20 I was a prominent member of the football club.
One day I was engaged in a match, and I sustained a nasty twist, which I think was got by my trying
to save myself. I came home from the match, and I felt a stinging pain in my back, but, like all
football players, paid no heed to it, thinking that I would be all right in a few days. But I got so
bad that I had to cease work and see the doctors—l had four—but my case baffled them. A lump
came on my back like a large marble. The doctor shook his head and said, ‘ Poor lad, you have spinal
disease and I would advise you to go into the infirmary.’ Well, I was sent to the Glasgow Infirmary,
and by this time I could only just crawl about. The pain I suffered was beyond description.
&
i n
Sir, I lay for eighteen weeks in the infirmary, and after that they despatched me home as incuralle.
My folks were communicated with, and poor John Robertson was driven home to die ! My jaws w ere
sunken, my legs were merely bones covered with skin. What was to be done V The highest ski.l in
the infirmarv had been baffled ;
T WAS AN INCURABLE.
My mother, there, spent £ i5O in trying to got me cured.
“ But, to continue my story,” said Mr. Robertson, “the doctors plainly said, ‘ Your case is quit,
incurable.’ At nights I lay moaning. My limbs were powerless, but I had my faculties, and whet
lying in bed there was always leaping into my mind an article X had once read in a newspaper about
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People curing a man at Lochgilphead, Argyllshire. I remembered
too that he had a hump growing on his back, and I was wondering and wondering if I shouldn’t give
Dr. Williams’ Pills a chance. I lighted upon the case of ‘ Little Nell ’in Glasgow and I read everv
detail of her suffering eagerly, and when I had come to the last word of it, I threw up my hands and
cried : - Yes, that’s my case ! I’ll give Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills a trial.’ I sent for several boxes
and I began with two pills after every meal, then I tried three, and though I had no power in my legs’
I suddenly felt a spring come into them, just as if the blood were returning to them I felt a sensa-
tion of life returning to my limbs, and for three months I persisted, taking the Pills regularly I got
to be able to stand between two chairs. Then one day I was able to let my whole weight go upon mv
legs and I managed to walk half a yard with my hands resting on the tops of the chairs. In a day or
two I was able to walk the length of the room. After a while I was able to walk on crutches • but
even them I was soon able to abandon. And, sir, it was Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and them alone,
which wrought the marvellous change m my case.”
“ And you are still able to take a walk now ? ”
“ Walk ! Why, on Saturday I tramped seven miles, and could have done twice the distance ”
Mrs. Robertson added : “ Yes, sir, Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills saved my son’s life. Had it not been
for them he would have been away to a land where suffering is unknown ’’

Gaoled in Paraguay.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Among the communistic pilgrims who fol-
lowed Crusader Lane to Paraguay, in the first
troupe per Royal Tar, was a West-Queensland
stockman named (say) Brown. He contributed
the required fee (some .£6O or .£7O) to the common
stock with a brimfulness of enthusiasm that was
worthy of a penitent drunkard’s revival. But
Brown sickened of the new and nobler life, even
during the voyage. Human nature, somehow or
other, didn’t pan out well on the self-sacrificial,
benefiting-others, mateship principle.
After 24 hours of the life of the new “promised
land,” Brown concluded that he wasn’t built for a
pilgrim, and he quickly shifted himself to Asun-
cion. He obtained a job of work for a farmer, an
Englishman, for whom he built a fence, and who
paid him for‘the job in—seven horses and a few
dollars.
With this live stock and small change Brown re-
turned to the “ New Australia ” settlement. There
he was at once reminded of the communistic law
that governed Laneland, and it was expected of
him that he would throw his horses and his dollars
into the common “ pool.”
Brown had no such notions. He calculated,
rather, that Laneland owed him something, and
individualism asserted itself. Not only did he
ruminate this aspect of his case, but he confided
his notions to one of the Lanelanders, a man
named Macleay, and proposed that the pair
should mate and leave Laneland. Macleay was
willing, and held individualistic ideas of his own.
The plan was instantaneously made. Next, came
the consideration of details.
Should they go empty-handed ? Should the
bold, free boys of Bananaland, accustomed
to take when they had the power, and to
keep when they could, submit to a sneaking-out
of the Pilgrim Brotherhood, after having paid
over of good gilt apiece for an illusion ?
Should they? Not much ! They would quit the
Bogus Paradise, but with spoils. Angels with
flaming swords, devils with boiling pitch and
burning brimstone, Don Lane (magistrate of the
new country) and all his disciples, and Paraguay,
with all its republican soldiers and police, should
not prevent them from marching out with all the
honors of piracy.
What was a fair thing ? They owed the settle-
ment a set-off for some days’ board and lodging
in Balmain (Sydney), and for a highly uninterest-
ing passage to Paraguay in the slow-going Royal
Tar. They had seven horses, earned by Brown’s
bush right-hand. Well, four cows and seven more
horses and a rifle would make about a “square
deal.” So they annexed these, although they
could not manage just then to acquire cartridges
for the rifle.
With 14 horses, four cows and a rifle, Brown
and Macleay made for an island in the swamps,
about seven miles from the central settlement. A
day or two later found them—having left the
horses and cattle on the island —in a small town-
ship about 12 miles from the central camp, buying
cartridges. The very same day, Paraguay police-
men, under orders because of “information re-
ceived,” tracked down the live-stock and captured
them. Brown and Macleay met the Paraguay
copmen, and rode hastily for the swamps, pursued
by the mStAdrinking myrmidons of the law.
Brown’s horse floundered into a deep hole, rolled
over, and flung Brown an ignominious captive
into the hands of an armed constable.
Macleay, who had the rifle, had also better luck.
He turned round every now and again upon his
pursuers and used his gun with such frighten-
ing effect that the Paraguay soldier-bobbies, not
being used to Australian bushrangers, gave up
pursuit of him.
Brown was cast into gaol.
Later, he was brought before an inferior sort of
judge. The court-house was an exhilarating
spectacle. The Judge sat aloft, cigar in mouth,
and with a bottle of liquor at his right elbow.
Every person in court —Judge, policemen, wit-
nesses, and even the prisoner, Brown—was
smoking ! Nevertheless, the taking of the deposi-
tions was tedious.
Brown got thirsty.
“ Bring us a big drink of rum,” said he.
A policeman brought it.
Business dragged along slowly.
Brown’s thirst got its “second wind” and took
a strong grip of him.
“Here ” —this to two disengaged witnesses and
three policemen—“ let’s go and have a drink while
this old (asterisk) is settling the case. Or, will
you come and have a drink yourself, Judge ? ”
His Honor pointed to the bottle at his
right elbow, and politely declined the proffered
courtesy.
Brown and his five guests strolled out of the
court and left the Judge to go on with the case.
They had a few rounds of drinks, some cigars, and
re-entered the courthouse, with their hats on, and
their cigars in full puff between their teeth.
The case ended, as all good things will.
His Honor decided that the charge was of too
serious a nature to be decided by an inferior
tribunal, and sent Brown to Asuncion to be tried
by a superior Judge.
Brown was once more clapped into gaol, and
remained there, without receiving a sign, for six
months.
An English rail way-contractor, named White,
heard of his plight. Also of the seven horses,
Brown’s own property, eating their heads off in
State pastures. White visited Brown with a pro-
posal to this effect—
“ See here, you Australian. You’ve been here
for six months awaiting trial. You may be here
six years, you may be here till you rot here, for
that matter, before they’ll ever think about you,
or, if they do think, it may be a generation before
they send a Judge to try you. Now, I’ve a bargain
to make with you. Let me have those seven
horses of yours, and I’ll get you liberated without
any trial at all, and without much delay.”
“ It’s a gamble,” said Brown.
A few days later Brown was shown the front
gate of the gaol and let depart without any ex-
planation whatever.

THE DIPSOMANTAC.
Maitland (N.S.W.) is not feeling so good
over its new court-house as it expected. The white
elephant cost .£12,000, and was to be opened with
much 6clat, but only Minister Gould turned up,
and that dry, precise, withered person said hardly
anything except that Brunker couldn’t come
because he and Reid were away looking after
Federation. Then the reception-committee went
broke because there is a deficiency of ,£ll in the
funds ; and there is no one to try in the new court-
house, and the whole business has fallen flat.
Chinese missions are the only things that boom in
Maitland these times.
The Second Satire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
She discovered him under a quince-tree, where
the air was brindling with a swarm of bees. A
couple of mild-eyed collies fawned around her, ancl
she addressed him sharply with allusions to their
untamed ferocity. They were unaccustomed to
white folk, she said, and there were prowling
Kanaka thieves and Hindoo jugglers. Her mother
was old-blind ... the dogs were very savage.
Finally she sat on the corner of the hi ve bench,
quivering and distressed. A pair of thin hands
were locked across his knees, and the couch-grass
hid his ragged boots. He looked up, and his open-
ing address ended in a nervous stutter something
about Australia’s magnificent distances. A_ fero-
cious collie bounded over and licked his hand ; she
blushed for her mis-statement and brought him
He was an author, a producer of unsuccessful
literary things, and the rest was told in a philis-
tine jargon unintelligible to this lithe-limbed
keeper of bees; but his voice was a newness
in the monotony, and somewhere she had heaid
that the pen was a long way ahead of the sword.
He was interesting, too —maned like a horse and
with a beard that suggested the Ancient Order of
Druids. ,
“You must come again,” she said. He caught
her watching him from the side of her eyes. I
will,” he replied. And he did.

His dun-coiored tent was pitched under the lee
of a basalt ridge, and at night a red dottel marked
his lair on the hillside. In the brief chill of dawn
Mattie —her name was Mattie—learned to watch
for the lifting smoke that boiled a poet’s billy. He
came, and he came, and she brought him wine in a
brick-red pitcher—home-made wine and very sweet.
The chatter of insolent birds filled the air when
she sang to him —sang in a fine contralto that was
full of loud melody. Also, he permitted her to
weave freshly-gathered vine-leaves in his hair ; it
was inexpressibly soothing, and it tickled his ear.
She cooed softly when the ruddy drops spilled
from the rift in his beard, chuckled and wept in
the couch-grass at his vivid word-pictures keyed to
her level and crowded with sympathy. Here
under the hot leaves, shut in by monotony, she
heard the tramp of hurrying humans, and at
night the star-crowned pinnacles became rows of
pavement lamps. The plain was a sea, and fatted
crows grew into gulls wailing across an endless
beach. His ships, too, were masterpieces—drawn
with a finger in the sand.
“You have suffered?” She would hold his
hand ; the soft oath that followed testified to his
past —the candle, the garret and the brain that
grew sick and dizzy when it looked at the written
page. There was the unremunerative journalism
that bled him of his power until faces jeered at
him from the dark ; and the mouse —the tiny blue
mouse that scuttled across the ceiling.
After he had gone she fell to considering, chin
in hand and very wise. He had called her a
dreamer —a little bush dreamer ; she would show
him that her mind was practical, and plainly it
was her duty to rid him of those horrid mice and
things. The following day a Chinaman delivered
to him a package—a neatly-wrapped mouse-trap,
perfect in detail even to the bit of cheese dangling
from the middle wire. He crawled from his tent
choking with lunatic mirth.
His°heel smashed it, and the bits that so cun-
ningly burlesqued his life’s agony he flung into the
gorge. He pondered for strong words to curse her
with He would drag her naked to the razorback
and pelt her with stones. A mouse-trap ! The
jerk of laughter set his heart leaping to his throat.
There was an interview and he was a calm
poet, serene and smiling with many teeth.
“I hate humor, girl; its beastly low, and I
don't think you understand me.
She wept copiously, with her cheek pressed
against his sullen, changeful face ; penitent tears
scalded his lean, nervous hands.
“ Was it wrong, dear ? I couldn’t mean wrong,
X love you so —I love you so, and I thought it
might help you.” # *
A brown hawk dipped across the sun’s
eye ; the rain-drunk hills in the east lay a-smoke in
the cracking heat of to-day. Last night she had
watched the sluicing rain quench a red dottel in
the ridges ; he had not come then, he would not
come now. The dogs barked furiously down the
track ; a limping Hindoo halted uncertainly in the
quince-shadow. He salaamed, and the dusty
beard wagged. The face that greeted him was
very white and the lips crushed.
“The hillman sahib I met along the river.
Mattie quaked and trembled.
“A letter?”
Mahommed Dass knelt, spreading out his
bundle. , , . , . T
“The sahib bought these things from me that I
might deliver them to the memsahib who grows
honey.” , .
Mattie laughed like a sleeping woman—mirth-
lessly. The nimble black fingers were spreading
things before her—little woollen shoes, baby shoes,
and mittens, a fleecy cape with a scarlet hood, and a
rattle for tiny fingers to play with. The wriggling
Hindoo arrayed them artistically and with an eye
to the matching of color. Mattie took them up
gently and kissed them one by one.
“Thank you,” she stammered, and crept indoors.
ALBA DORION.
Dear Bulletin,—The other day, our big
rooster (the one with the feathers down his legs)
swallowed a locust, and all the hens were wild be-
cause they thought they should have got it. That
was one funny part; but the rooster (with the
feathery legs) must have swallowed the locust
whole, for it started squeaking down among his
other food, and lie and all the other fowls began
moving round, looking for it, thinking it was a
different locust, and it was like a football-match.
Ma and pa and the man next door came down and
thought the rooster had the death rattle, but I
knew what it was, because I was sitting on the
fence and saw him swallow the locust, but I didn’t
let on. I wish our fowls would swallow some
more live locusts, because we had poultry for
dinner that day.—Yours, Tommy.
