National Notebook
A Financial Proposition?
Ane of the most interesting develop-
ments in the newspaper world has
been the decision of John Fairfax &
Sons to turn their bi-weekly “Financial
Review” into a daily, published Monday
through to Friday, and selling at Is. a
copy.
The bi-weekly “Financial Review” was
credited with a circulation of 22,000
on Tuesday and 28,000 on Thursday. It
never had sufficient confidence to expose
itself to the Audit Bureau of Circulation,
but these figures were accepted as being
approximately correct.
The turning of it into a daily publica-
tion five days a week is a courageous
attempt to emulate the “Wall Street
Journal” and “The Finan-
cial Times” of London.
Whether Australia is
ready yet. to support
profitably a daily financial
paper remains to be seen,
but it has got away to a
good start. Although these
figures are not and will not be verified
by the Audit Bureau of Circulation, it
is credited with an average daily sale of
10,000. At 1/- a copy this could be
another bonanza for the Fairfax stable.
The pertinent queries are:
1. Will the public want to read and be
able to read a financial paper five days
a week, and
2. Will the advertisers support it as they
did the old bi-weekly “Financial Review”
with less than half the circulation at the
same advertising rate.
Tyson succeeded the legendary Mike
Connors, who 10 years earlier had taken
over from someone still more legendary
called Watto —even Tyson didn’t know
his real name. The breakfast hospital
sessions include proverbs by Tyson’s
creation Ah Too, a kind of bowdlerised
Confucius Says, and a line of excellent
children’s stories from South Africa
about gallant Spanish onions who fall in
love with tomatoes. These stories are
quite enough to make the crustiest com-
muter miss his bus.
A large part of the new book consists
of Terse Verses, which Tyson writes
each morning at the ABC’s new Too-
wong studios after nutting them out on
his way in from Clayfield, where he lives
with his wife, Joy, and
sons, Charles (14) and
Stephen (10).
Sample verse, inspired
by a news item about a
Warwickshire vicar who
fined tardy brides. . . .
An early collection of teapot philo-
sophy, “Philosopher’s Notebook,” came
out two years ago and sold 25,000
copies. Both books were published by
Lansdowne Press.
One bride arrived a bit early,
She was not up to any old tricks,
And she sweetly said to the vicar,
You owe me seven and six.
The Man Who Comes
To Breakfast
Tn Sydney a few days ago for the
A launching of his second book,
“Philosopher’s Scrapbook”, was Bris-
bane ABC man Russ Tyson, the man
who has been coming to breakfast with
Australian radio listeners for the last 15
years.
Even the bedridden can’t escape him,
for the breakfast session includes a
“Hospital Half Hour” that features
requests Schubert’s “Ave Maria” and
other famous etceteras for patients in
hospitals all over Australia.
In 15 years Tyson has visited hospitals
from Longreach to Mount Gambier, and
has just been honored with a Russ Tyson
Recreation Hall at Brisbane’s Montrose
Home for Crippled Children. His pro-
grammes come from Brisbane and go on
Radio Australia to Europe, the Northern
Pacific, and Antarctica, and unofficially
to the United States to ham operators
who write him appreciative letters.
Safe Deposit
IYThen banks take an interest in art they
do it properly. The Commonwealth
Savings Bank this year sponsored the
Blake prize for religious art and exhibited
entries in the bank. The bank doubled the
prize, “because £5OO is a nice round
sum”. Two hundred and fifty pounds,
apparently, is not. However, artists next
year may see to it that their paintings
are hung near, perhaps, the foreign
exchange or safe deposit counters, which
have few visitors, rather than at with-
drawals, where the day before pay-day
milling customers tend to obscure the
paintings altogether.
This year protests about the non-
religious quality of some of the Blake
prize entries were stronger than usual.
It now turns out that two paintings by
expatriate Louis James, “The Red
Knight” and “The Dreamtime”, were
never intended for the exhibition at all.
They were part of an exhibition by
James at the von Bertouch Galleries,
Newcastle, in August. The Common-
wealth Art Advisory Board expressed
interest in buying one and asked the

gallery to send a couple to Sydney for
consideration by the board.
Two paintings were sent to the board,
at the Commonwealth Bank Building in
Martin Place. Three weeks later they
were reported as not received. They
had actually gone to the Savings Bank
across the street, been unpacked and,
without any more to-do, been put among
the Blake entries. While correspondence
flowed between Canberra and Sydney in
efforts to locate them, the paintings
hung peacefully in the Blake. The mix-
up was not untangled until closing day.
Reading Between the Lions
Tust when we felt Australia had per-
** suaded people that it had more to
offer than the kangaroo and the koala,
Mrs Joy Adamson insists that we do not
make enough of our fauna as an attrac-
tion for overseas visitors. Mrs Adamson,
who made more than £lOO,OOO from
her “Elsa” books, which told about her
life with a lioness, is here to collect money
to transfer animals to reserves and to
maintain those reserves in Kenya.
However, Mrs Adamson was not think-
ing about picture postcards nor cuddly
little toy koalas. She is strongly opposed
to animals being killed for their fur. She
was thinking of national parks, suf-
ficiently large for animals to maintain
themselves in their natural state inde-
finitely. “We are running out of land
in Kenya,” she said, “That is why animals
have to be transferred to reserves, but
here you have plenty. It is all very
well having small sanctuaries near cities,
but there should be large reserves in
open bush. And it is the only way to
keep the animals safe from the farmer,
and the farmer safe from the animals.”
Mrs Adamson, in spite of 30 years in
Kenya, still has a fairly impenetrable
accent. She was born in Vienna and has
a formidable list of achievements beyond
writing best-sellers and taming lions. In
Vienna she studied medicine, psycho-
analysis, music, painting and sculpture,
typing and shorthand, dressmaking and
botany.
Press Man
TTugh Price, manager-elect of the new
Sydney University Press, was re-
cently in Sydney on reconnaissance from
Wellington, where he has been working
in the School Publications Branch of the
New Zealand Education Department.
His Sydney appointment begins in Janu-
ary.
Sydney University is a late starter in
this field. Melbourne, Queensland and
the ANU are all ahead of it, and so in a
fashion is the University of Western
Australia Press. Sydney’s Vice-Chancel-
lor, Sir Stephen Roberts, has wanted for
a long time to set up a press; and now he
is able to do it handsomely, for SUP will
sail into battle backed by an astounding
£400,000 bequest to the university by
the late Sophia Eleanor Wood, Sydney’s
Metropole-dwelling “Mrs Diamonds”.
Sir Stephen himself is chairman of the
board of the Press.
At 34, Hugh Price has plenty of ex-
perience of books. After graduating in
Arts at Wellington he joined in 1952
the London buying staff of Whitcombe
and Tombs, the big New Zealand book-
sellers. He soon gave that up for free-
lance editorial and production work in
London, then returned to Wellington to
manage a bookshop. In 1956 with a
friend he started his own spare-time
publishing company, Price Milburn, and
since then has produced about 30 books.
Besides works of research and learned
journals, SUP will publish textbooks for
university use and possibly also for
secondary schools. But not all of the
press’s publishing will be academic.
Price said he hoped to have many books
of general interest on his list as well.

PLAIN ENGLISH
This Liquidity Fuss!
THERE is now an almost
neurotic obsession in Aus-
tralia with excess cash funds
circulating in the economy and
this at a time when economic con-
ditions are sound and look like
improving still further.
All this talk of liquidity in the
Australian economy merely ex-
presses a fear of what might happen
if it gets out of hand. As a result
several kites are being flown by
interested parties who want to see
that any surplus cash is directed
where it will do the most good. This
is in no sense evidence of a “boom-
let” inflating. There is no need for
drastic action and no talk of it.
There is no liquidity crisis.
Nor is there any need to read
into the statements of Dr Coombs
more than is there. He has merely
warned the trading banks to watch
their new lending commitments so
that too much money doesn’t get
into circulation. It’s as simple as
that. The Reserve Bank has the
power to call up statutory deposits
from the trading banks and also to
raise interest rates. It can contain
any excess liquidity at any time and,
in fact, Australia is becoming
accustomed to this new role of
flexible credit within the banking
system.
It is an accepted practice over-
seas, where the Reserve Bank raises
or lowers interest rates to control
the flow of credit. Australia has
come slowly to this sophisticated
form of interest rate control and
credit manipulation but haunting
fears of “credit squeeze” legislation,
such as experienced in December,
1960, still remain. That is why any
mention of a credit squeeze, shame-
lessly dramatised by Opposition
leader Mr Arthur Calwell, causes
panic in all circles, because both
business and labor are its victims.
No major crisis will occur if the
Reserve Bank calls up surplus
liquid funds of the trading banks
and freezes them in Statutory
Reserve Deposits. This is an estab-
lished policy and the current ratio
of only 10.8 p.c. of deposits lodged
with the Reserve Bank is the lowest
for years. It was up around 171
p.c. in February, 1960, and Febru-
ary, 1961.
A call up of these funds is over-
due. The Reserve Bank has been
trying to do everything possible to
encourage an economic recovery
without providing too much fuel for
inflation. Its moderation no doubt
has been influenced by the fact that
the Australian public has shown no
inclination to use the large volume
of credit available to it in the dis-
closed level of bank overdraft
approvals. At the end of September
the public had £1845 m. of bank
overdraft limits to call upon but
was using only £lOB7 m. The bal-
ance of unused credit, amounting
to £750 m., could never be
employed in full because as soon
as one cheque is drawn it goes into
someone else’s account. Bankers
say you can only use about 60 p.c.
of it. But if £2OO m. of that unused
credit were put into circulation, the
Reserve Bank would regard it as a
too-sudden lift. That is why it has
asked the trading banks to keep
new lending at a reasonable level
of around £lO m. a week.
VTATURALLY enough, the trad-
ing banks don’t want to see any
drastic call up of their surplus funds
because they suffer a severe loss
of interest. They would much prefer
to lodge surplus funds in Common-
wealth bonds at 4i p.c. They, as
well as Dr Coombs, have been
aware of the excess liquidity for
some months and they will be anx-
ious to heed Dr Coombs’ request
and keep a careful watch on new
lending commitments.
Having made all this quite clear,
and having illustrated that a call up
of surplus bank funds is a normal
procedure, there is no justification
for making the Reserve Bank policy
a political football.
If Sir lan Potter, Melbourne’s
leading stockbroker, drew attention
to the excess liquidity in the econ-
omy, it was only to a natural
development of which most people
are aware. But, as a financier, he
has a special interest in the expan-
sion of his own short-term money
market operations, because all
official dealers in this market are
concerned at the development of an
unofficial “buy-back” market in
short-term lending where Australian
companies with surplus cash have
been lending to each other at rates
slightly higher than the official mar-
ket, thus by-passing the regular
market. If the short-term money
market dealers could receive official
approval for a raising of their lend-
ing limits and also for the establish-
ment of a “buy-back” market with
the Commonwealth Bank as lender
of the last resort, they would be
happy.
None of these situations involves
a credit squeeze in the form of
official legislation. But it is as well
to remember that, for the national
good, it is essential that the Reserve
Bank should exercise a sensible
policy of flexible credit control.
Without such a policy, the so-called
excess liquidity could cause un-
necessary mischief and undermine
the present hard-won stability.
A Foreign Policy Election
TF, as predicted, the coming elec-
A tions prove to be the first fought
in this country on foreign policy is-
sues then a grave responsibility will
rest with both Liberal and Labor
Party politicians to tread carefully
in the field of foreign relations and
to measure their words. Indonesia’s
confrontation of Malaysia is not a
case for political stunting. Presi-
dent Soekarno’s intransigent policy
towards Malaysia deriving from
a complex of nationalistic and
xenophobic motives has led
Indonesia to the position where it
is finding out what it is like to be
without friends or influence in a
cold, hard world. Indonesia is now
stewing in its own juice over
Malaysia and should be left in it.
Vilification of Indonesia in an Aus-
tralian election campaign will not
contribute anything helpful to the
new State of Malaysia and certainly
won’t help Australia’s relations with
its nearest neighbor.


THIS AUSTRALIA
NEW ZEALAND
The Trans-Tasman
Election
Non-Labor vote split
FROM RON TAYLOR IN AUCKLAND
HOLYOAKE
Threatened?
Qver the years New Zealand voters
have come to accept “handouts” as
the method by which political parties
buy their mandate. But this November 30
general election is different. Vote buying
is out.
Instead the Kiwi voter must choose
either to keep the reigning National
(Tory) Party in power on the “steady-
does-it policy followed for the last three
years, or switch to Labor with its drastic
“new look” image designed to boost
trade and exports by at least £2O million
a year. Both policies mean some belt
tightening and hard work.
And at this stage the result of the
election is anybody’s guess, for while
National swept Labor from office with
a 12-seat majority at the 1960 election,
the political climate has again changed.
The Government has lost ground in by-
elections, has been criticised for its weak
stand with the British over the Common
Market negotiations, and lack of drive
for new markets. Coupled with this there
has been a revision of electoral bound-
aries and, most ominous of all for the
Tories, the emergence of a reasonable
third party apart from Social Credit—
the Liberals.
Social Credit with its “funny money”
ideas has never been taken seriously by
New Zealand voters. But the Liberals
are different.
Last active in New Zealand politics
30 years ago, the Liberals were finally
liquidated by Labor. Their remnants
were swallowed in the then new National
Party formed from what was left of the
Conservatives after the huge Socialist
victories of the 19305.
Liberal leader Robert M. Hutton-
Potts, ex-newspaper editor and one-time
crony of the National Party, says he will
only put forward 20 candidates. He is
hopeful of getting one or two seats and
will be disappointed if each Liberal does
not get at least 500 votes.
If they do get 500 votes then the
Government is out. The Liberals are
spread in the marginal seats and there
is no doubt they will draw off National
votes.
Labor’s vote is constant although it
sank to the hard core in 1960 with voters
bitter against an administration which
had made heavy tax increases. Actually
Labor lost more by default. Many of its
supporters withheld their vote, but at the
same time refused to endorse the
National candidate. These voters should
come back to Labor this time.
Official National reaction to the
Liberals is one of contempt. The catch-
cry is: “The Liberals will never get off
the ground.”
In truth the party's concern is typified
by the interjector at Hutton-Potts’ cam-
paign-opening meeting who wailed: “All
you are trying to do is take votes off our
Mr Holyoake.”
National’s leader is stocky, barrel-
chested Keith Holyoake, now in his
second term as Prime Minister. He led
the National Government for the last
few months of 1957 when it lost to
Labor headed by Walter Nash.
Self-educated and a farmer, Holyoake
is a shrewd politician and an able parlia-
mentary tactician. But at the same time
he is capable of dangerous pomposity as
witness his recent exhibition on the Aus-
tralian TV show Four Corners. In that
programme he condescended to inter-
viewer Michael Charlton. He got a blast
from the New Zealand Press, in par-
ticular from Auckland “Star” columnist
Noel Holmes who described Holyoake’s
comments as a “pompous line of guff.”
The Government has made it clear
that it will rely on its performance of
the last three years. And it must be
admitted that, despite the Common
Market threat, the country’s economy is
buoyant.
Labor’s “new look” is largely the
result of its new leader, ex-boxer, ex-
Rugby player, ex-Presbyterian minister,
ex-Minister of Finance Arnold Nord-
meyer. He took over control of the
Parliamentary Labor Party early this year
from octogenarian Nash.
Under ageing Nash, Labor had become
bogged down in its own dogma. The
party machine - had gone to the pack.
Toughest job for Labor is selling
Nordmeyer to the public. While nobody
challenges Nordmeyer’s ability, many
still remember him as Nash's hatchet-
man Finance Minister who brought in
heavy taxes. This could be one of Labor’s
biggest hurdles.
But the nightmare for the Government
is still the uncalculated Liberal vote,
because in a voting system that is first
past the post they have no chance of
getting back the lost Liberal votes
through the distribution of preferences.
THE ELECTIONS—I
One Man’s Judgment
Sir Robert versus Mathematics...
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
SIR ROBERT
He decided ...
Federal Election now gaining
momentum following the expiry last
week of the 24th Commonwealth Parlia-
ment could well be described as the
election of Judgment versus Mathematics.
The reason the Prime Minister, Sir
Robert Menzies, called on this election
at this point of time, a year prematurely,
and without waiting for the parliament
to live out its normal constitutional life
of three years, is simply because he
believes he can win now.
At a recent Press conference he said
with engaging frankness that this was
basic to his thinking—if he thought he
could not win he would not be holding
an election. He may be right,
The Prime Minister is a very shrewd
and old political dog and he has dis-
regarded unfavorable factors to go to the


voters before, and since 1949 his judg-
ment has been vindicated time after time.
But his Labor opposition believes that
mathematics are working for them, and
on paper their arguments are potent and
quite impressive.
While there are all kinds of issues
the TFX, Labor’s attitude towards Aus-
tralian troops in Malaysia, Labor’s in-
sistence that it should have joint control
with the United States over the proposed
US radio communications base at Ex-
mouth, post-election economic policy
these issues are not clear-cut.
It is not a case of Labor saying to the
Americans over Exmouth Gulf “Go
Home, Yanks”, which would make the
issue completely clear-cut. It is only a
case that the Labor attitude on joint
control MIGHT lead the Yanks to go
home of their own accord.
Labor is not saying that it will not
defend Malaysia in an emergency, but
that it will not station Australian troops
in Malaysia to help defend the area un-
less such stationing is done under a
clear and public treaty.
The issues then are blurred round the
edges.
Rightly or wrongly Labor believes
that there is no issue at this stage suffi-
ciently clear-cut to become a sufficiently
great issue to endanger Opposition seats.
Coupled with this is another factor
the absence of an electoral redistribution.
For various reasons —of which the
most potent was inter - governmental
parties’ friction —the Menzies Govern-
ment decided against going ahead with a
redistribution after its initial attempt to
secure one was abandoned.
A redistribution would undoubtedly
help the Liberals more.
Since the 1961 elections the popula-
tion has been eroding from the inner
blue - ribbon Labor seats in the cities.
Members representing Labor strongholds
are also seeing their numbers decline,
but this erosion does not mean that
Labor seats are being weakened.
Where are these numbers moving to?
If they are eroding into Labor swing
seats they are making it more difficult
for the Liberals to win back those seats
from Labor. If they are eroding into
Liberal seats they are making those seats
so much harder for Liberal representa-
tives to hold.
THE ELECTIONS—II
Status Quo in Three States?
Liberal v. CP test in West
FROM CORRESPONDENTS IN PERTH, HOBART AND ADELAIDE
Tn Western Australia, Tasmania and
South Australia the omens augur
for a political status quo in the 25 seats
in the three States.
In the West the party machines are
proving slow to move into operation and
there is a consensus that the balance will
not change.
For the Government parties this sense
of complacency is probably related to the
pro-Government vote in 1961, when
WA was the only State where the
LCP maintained its overall vote posi-
tion. This was due in large part to
Commonwealth benevolence almost
£50,000,000 in Federal money was
pledged to State projects in two years.
The Labor Party knows it cannot
pick up any seats in WA unless a really
big swing tips Richard Cleaver out in
Swan, then the result would be a fore-
gone conclusion in other States. It will
be fighting to consolidate the key seats
of Kalgoorlie and Stirling it won back
in 1961 rather than attempting a major
State-wide campaign.
Once again, the DLP probably holds
the key to the vital seats. In 1961, Harry
Webb almost failed to regain Stirling for
Labor because the DLP polled about
121 per cent of the votes. This time,
Stirling has 5,600 more electors and
the DLP has put up State secretary
Brian Peachey in an obvious attempt to
oust Left-winger Webb. In Kalgoorlie,
Labor man Fred Collard just squeaked
home when the DLP preferences went
heavily to the Liberal, Peter Browne.
This year Mr Browne is again attempt-
ing to regain the seat he won so un-
expectedly in 1958.
Moore and Canning are the two in-
teresting seats for the political scientists.
Sitting Country Party member Hugh
Leslie flew back to Perth in a tiff when
he heard that the Liberal Party was
opposing him in Moore, then suddenly
announced that he would not contest it
for family reasons. Nobody really knows
whether Mr Leslie was eased out because
his statements over the Liberal can-
didature embarrassed the coalition
parties, but the outcome is that the
Country Party has emerged with a strong
candidate in Don Maisey, a former
president of the Australian Wheat-
growers’ Federal Council and a potential
Cabinet Minister. He can hardly lose
with ALP preferences.
Canning will be a straight fight be-
tween the Liberal and Country parties
for the first time. Len Hamilton held it
for the CP for more than 10 years, but
when he retired in 1961 Liberal Neil Mc-
Neill romped home from CP candidate
Jack Hallett, who failed to get as many
primary votes as the ALP candidate.
In Tasmania the Government’s failure
to carry through a redistribution is the
only factor which conceivably can upset
the representation.
Franklin, already the largest of the
five electorates guaranteed to the State
under the Constitution, continues to grow
as Government housing estates spread
over Hobart’s eastern shore. A block of
about 5000 voters who backed Labor
four to one at the last election was to
have been removed, but now they remain
to worry the sitting Liberal, C. W. J.
Falkinder, who won in 1946, recently
returned from Pathfinder Force with a
DSO, DFC and Bar.
His sprawling electorate goes from the
Hobart metropolitan area into the tiger
country of the Gordon River. Signifi-
cantly, it is in that region that the Com-
monwealth has just announced it will
drive a £2,500,000 developmental road.
Falkinder's opponent is J. A. Parsons,
a fruitgrower from the Huon, where his
family settled in 1838. This is strong
Falkinder territory and the attack is
shrewdly placed. Nevertheless, Falkinder
in the landslide of 1961 got his biggest
majority since 1951. Even the addition
of 2900 voters of slightly Labor tinge
should not topple him.
Many of Falkinder’s unwelcome ad-
ditional voters come from Denison,
where the task of Defence Minister
Athol Townley will consequently be that
much easier. Now, with 1000 fewer
voters on the roll, and boosted by his
Washington aircraft deal, he should in-
crease his 1961 absolute majority.
The other three seats are the personal
property of Laborites G. W. A. Duthie
(Wilmot), R. Davies (Braddon) and L. H.
Barnard (Bass). Figures at the last poll
showed that their victories were against
the course of nature. They polled well
above ALP Senate votes.
The struggling Tasmanian Country
Party is not putting up candidates this
time.
In South Australia no one expects any
change. At present the situation is six
ALP to five Liberal Country League. The
absence of a separate Country Party
eliminates the prospect of any split in
the non-Labor vote. In Barker, however,
Dr J. Forbes (Lib.) does face a challenge
from Mr H. A. Burns, a Naracoorte
grazier who calls himself independent
LCL. In the ALP seats a flurry over a
decision by the party machine that mem-
bers over 70 should not be eligible to
stand again died down when the two
men affected, Mr N. Makin (Bonython)
and Mr A. Thompson (Port Adelaide),
withdrew by telegram their nominations,
after an attempt by Mr Calwell to gain
their re-endorsement failed.


LAW
NSW Judges
Overruled
Parliamentary Intervention
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
/Confronted with masses of paper and
a multiplicity of gazettals, parlia-
ments tend to become careless in the
review and supervision of regulations.
But in Sydney last week Australia’s
oldest legislative body, the Legislative
Council of New South Wales, asserted
the right of Parliament to intervene ■—■
in this case with decisions on rules by
none other than the Supreme Court of
New South Wales.
The Council by unanimous vote dis-
allowed certain Rules of Court approved
by the judges of the Supreme Court.
Such a move was said to be without
precedent in the memory of NSW con-
stitutional authorities, although in
Western Australia last July the Upper
House there had disallowed judges’ rules,
after some tart speaking.
In the velvet-draped chamber of the
NSW Legislative Council last week, how-
ever, there were no harsh words towards
the judges, and speakers went out of their
way to emphasise that they did not make
any reflection on the judiciary.
But the judges’ new rules, which would
have changed the mode of personal in-
jury trials before juries radically, were
out. The judges’ decision would have
allowed doctors to be excused attendance
in person and to furnish an affidavit, so
escaping cross-examination. Mr Cedric
Cahill (ALP), a barrister, told the Coun-
cil that the new rules “would virtually
mean the end of oral evidence in cases
of personal injury.” The Bar Association
had not been consulted on the changes
and last week in a statement, in the firm
tone that has become characteristic of it
over the last few years, the President,
Mr C. L. D. Meares, QC, said the coun-
cil of his association strongly supported
the traditional oral evidence.
The move for the rules change was
said to have come from the Medico-
Legal Society of which a Supreme Court
judge, Mr Justice Else-Mitchell, is presi-
dent. But the action of the judges had
raised questions of principle; on consul-
tation of the profession, as the Bar Coun-
cil pointed out, and on the wider issue
that such radical changes should be
matters for legislation.
The momentum for the Council’s
action came from the legal profession
and through the Council’s committee
on subordinate legislation, which has
three legal members, Mr Begg, QC, Mr
Clayton, both Liberal, and Mr Cahill.

The Lost £235,000
“Specious manoeuvrings with cheques”
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
EWidence emerging during a court case
in Melbourne City Court last week
shed a little more light on the rise and fall
of the Testro Bros empire. One of the
puzzling questions for observers had been
just why the £235,000 paid by Testro
Brothers for a controlling interest in
Garrisson Industries in June last year
evaporated in a matter of months.
Before the Court were two directors of
Garrisson Industries, William Baker and
John Bishop, pleading not guilty to
charges of not having used reasonable
diligence.
The case follows an inspector’s report
to the Attorney-General and it was this
report that Mr Peter Murphy, QC, for
the Crown, made use of in his opening
address. Mr Murphy told the Court
bluntly that “specious manoeuvrings” by
Garrisson Industries Ltd had converted
overdrafts into apparent credit balances.
Mr Murphy stated he would provide
evidence to show that on June 30, 1961,
Mr P. W. Garrisson (M.L.A. for
Hawthorn) drew a cheque for £175,000
against Garrisson Holdings (which was a
Garrisson family proprietary) in favor
of Garrisson Industries. But before that
cheque had to be met Mr Garrisson drew
a cheque for £lBO,OOO on Garrisson In-
dustries in favor of Garrisson Holdings,
so that when the first cheque had to be
met it was covered by the second one.
This enabled the balance sheet of Gar-
risson Industries as at June 30, 1961, to
be drawn up eliminating the debt of
£175,000, which meant that the company
showed a net credit balance of £149,000
whereas there was actually a bank over-
draft.
What was of interest in the matter to
Testro’s 3,500 debenture holders (average
holding £400) was their recollection of
Mr Rex Testro’s statement to a meeting
last March that the Garrisson purchase
had been exhaustively examined and that
there had been a signed warranty as well
as a balance sheet signed by auditors.
But whatever the outcome of the cur-
rent hearing the out-of-pocket debenture
holders would have more information
when Peter Wolsey Garrisson, the chair-
man of directors of Garrisson Industries,
appeared before the Court later this
month on four charges under the Com-
panies Act.
ANNEXING POLYNESIA

HThe argument that annexation of all
A Polynesia is requisite to strength-
en our position is a most debatable
one. A nation or a community which
is firmly established as we are not
yet, and will require all our energies
to become in a continent as large
as Europe, and which, in addition,
holds a group (New Zealand) answer-
ing very fairly to the British Isles, can
surely dominate the quarter of the
globe in which it exists. What a farce
it would be to contend that a nation
which held all Europe, and Great
Britain and Ireland, could not feel
safe unless it possessed and brought
under the rule Iceland, Sardinia, Cor-
sica, the Azores, the Channel Islands,
and the lonian Archipelago. And how
doubly a farce if half of Europe, and
that half the most fertile and rich in
mineral wealth, remained undeveloped.
If we can’t maintain our supremacy
in the South Seas when our strength
is concentrated how is it to be hoped
that we shall do so by dissipating our
energies and distributing our risks over
Polynesia?

ELECTORATES
Playford’s Seat
Shuffle...
“A tooth and nail fight ”
FROM BRIAN UNDERWOOD IN ADELAIDE
SIR THOMAS
Safe
At first sight it might appear that the
proposed new SA electoral system,
by which the rural voter is worth two
and a half city voters, is hardly very
progressive, but by South Australian
standards it is a great move towards pro-
portional representation. The previous
relationship was about one to four. But
the Labor Party is naturally still not
impressed.
The surprising thing about the old
system was that it did not produce a
huge LCL majority. Instead of depen-
dence or independence, Labor declares
that this is due to a majority of the voters
being pro-Labor and quotes Federal
Senate voting to prove it (so many State
electorates are not contested that it is
difficult to prove anything by State
figures). But if there is a natural Labor
majority it is obviously not large and
one would expect it to be quite out-
weighed by the existing Playford elec-
toral system.
The reason it was not so is that the
small quota for country electorates iso-
lated several country towns with Labor
majorities, instead of these majorities
being outweighed by surrounding LCL
votes. The LCL then piled up unneces-
sarily huge majorities in other rural
electorates.
The new system is designed to offset
this. The quota for country electorates
is higher, and a new category—that of
“country-industrial” e.g. Port Pirie and
Whyalia has been created, with a quota
two-thirds that of the city. Also, the
“metropolitan” area has been extended,
and now includes the nearby city of
Gawler.
Thus, though the number of country
seats has been dropped from 26 to 20 —
plus two “country-industrial” —it is
quite likely that the net country result
will be that the LCL gets the same
number of seats, while Labor loses
three.
The additional six new city electorates
might seem heavily in favor of Labor.
But the old metropolitan share of four
LCL seats to nine Labor (ten with
Gawler) was far from being in propor-
tion to votes. Population changes had
brought it about that the electoral boun-
daries favored Labor. Under the new
division the LCL hopes to win seven of
the 20 metropolitan seats, which would
mean that Labor, too, could get only
three more.
This would mean, in a Parliament
enlarged from 39 to 42, the Play ford
Government would gain three seats.
Labor’s denunciation of the new scheme
is therefore highly understandable.
Under the old system, a stage had
been reached where a freak personal
vote in one electorate could have put
the Playford Government out of office.
Under the new one this would be less
likely. But on the other hand, there
would be more seats with relatively small
LCL majorities, and a definite swing to
Labor could more easily cause a break-
through. To this extent, Labor should
be a little happier.
But the Parliamentary Leader of the
Party, Mr Walsh, was far from happy.
He promised that the Labor Party would
“fight this proposed redivision tooth and
nail.”
TRADE UNIONS
Curbing the Shop
Committees
“Machinations of outsiders”
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
ALBERT MONK
Anti-committees
Qrowing friction between the Mel-
bourne Trades Hall Council and
shop committees operating in the en-
gineering, metal and power industries
came to a head last week when the
THC carried a resolution calling on
unions to enforce more discipline on the
committees and on the committees them-
selves to remember their obligations to
the trade union movement as a whole.
Shop committees are inter-union bodies,
acting within a particular plant or enter-
prise and often they are set up in very
informal ways, to put it mildly. They
operate under rules of their own design
and secret ballots are the exception
rather than the rule in their operations.
The Communist Party has devoted a
lot of energy to the development of shop
committees over the years. In theory, a
shop committee only concerns itself with
activity in the enterprise on which it is
based, but the Communists have been
able to supply co-ordination between
these scattered units. As a result, some-
thing of a rival trade union movement
has grown up, able to challenge the
authority of the THC and even the
ACTU. This growth of a union move-
ment within the official union movement
has been most marked in Victoria’s
power industries.
In the THC debate last Thursday, as-
sistant secretary Mick Jordan predicted
that “industrial anarchy” would result
if the shop committees carried on as they
have been doing. The fruits of delicate,
painstaking negotiations had often been
destroyed by their reckless activities.
A CTU president Albert Monk also
took part in the debate: “The trade
union movement is going back,” he said,
“and is likely to go back further because
responsible officers of the unions who
are negotiating through committees are
being circumvented by the machinations
of people outside the movement.”
Monk went on to draw attention
*° area committees” (composed of
several shop committees in a particular
region) and the way they were attempting
*° usur P P ovvers °f the ACTU itself,
The ACTU, some time ago, drew up
a charter which defined the role of
committees. This said they should
leave matters affecting wage rates and
conditions to the unions concerned,
The THC last week resolved that its
affiliated unions be asked to ensure that
shop committees worked under terms of
the ACTU charter.
However, Mr Jordan made it plain
that this resolution alone will not solve
the problem. “This is the first step
back a i on g the road by the THC to put
its house in order and see that its
decisions and authority are maintained.”


Around Melbourne
WHAT ABOUT THE ARTS-AND THE KITTENS?
117 e have always considered our-
selves to be the Australian city
of dignity. Well, dignitywise, the past
few weeks have been a trifle unnerving.
Let us start by hoping that you did not
see the Melbourne issue of the “Cur-
rent Affairs Bulletin”. Among other
things it described us as being drab,
uninspiring, banal, barbarous in some
of our habits, and dreary. The only
reason we stuck it out and didn’t flock
off to better places was because we
were stunned by our mediocrity and
arrogance.
Oh, it went on. We were virtually
lost to the arts, our domestic architec-
ture disastrous, the girls blank-faced,
and in the evening the population
fled to hundreds of square miles of
suburbia to draw down the puritan
blinds and settle itself before the blue
shimmer of the television screens.
This was too much. Mr Bolte him-
self led the counter-attack. “Nonsense
and ludicrous,” said he. “All over-
seas visitors who come here say
Melbourne is one of the most beauti-
ful cities in the world.”
Reassuringly, our leaders told us
how good Melbourne was; and we,
too, would like to correct one or two
inaccuracies. Art, heavens above,
we’re stuffed with it. Everybody you
know is opening an art gallery. Ball
and Welch has just handed over a
whole floor to the Museum of Modern
Art. They’ve discovered that a Tucker,
a Boyd, a Len French or two on the
walls is a dandy way of selling haber-
dashery.
Night life? Sirs, we might suggest
there's too much of it. In St Kilda
there are more throbbing guitars than
Mini Minors. South Yarra has its
Playboy Club and its Bunnies. Then,
just over the way there’s the Riverside
with its Kittens. One of the most
stirring battles in the entertainment
world the Kittens and the Bunnies
are fighting it out scratch for scratch.
Sydney has closed down on strip-
tease joints. Not here; our joints are
showing a superb amount of pink
flesh, with girlie shows running in
half a dozen places. Why, there’s
Forbidden City, “an unusual night out
for adults”, La Wanda, the Goddess
of Fire, at the Hotel Britannia, and
Sabra Samarr the Shapely Thorough-
bred Filly, at the Hollyford.
It was the “Sun News Pictorial”
which hit back against the “Current
Affairs Bulletin”. It started a “Beauti-
ful Melbourne” photograph competi-
tion £lOO for first, £75 for second,
and £25 for third. Already we have
had shots of the Yarra, the Shrine,
the unbelievable old Rialto building,
and even the Melbourne Club.
But the “Sun” was determined to
find out who had done this thing to
us, and they did. It was Chris Wallace-
Crabbe, poet, critic, Lockie Fellow in
Australian Literature at Melbourne
University. Alas, when cornered he
didn’t have quite the same savagery.
He said: “I'm not apologising for what
I said. But remember this: with all
its faults, Melbourne is far ahead,
much more pleasant than Sydney.
Melbourne is the most pleasant city
in Australia. I’m Melbourne-born and
proud of it. I only mentioned Mel-
bourne’s faults because I love it so
much and wish the very best for it. ..”
You can devote maybe 10 years to
writing poetry and cause little stir.
Say a few words in anger about Mel-
bourne and in as many hours you’re
a sensation and a by-word.
THhen there was the other little affair
which lowered our dignity rating,
the disappearance of the Melbourne
Cup. Oh, we have lost cups before.
Artilleryman’s 1919 cup was. . . ah. ..
taken from the Melbourne Club in
1939. Trivalve’s 1927 cup was taken
from the Athenaeum Club in 1938.
The Melbourne Club got its cup back,
but the Athenaeum is still looking.
Then, the dangerous part about the
whole thing was this. It went off
from the window of the New Zealand
Tourist Bureau. You must understand
that we are very sensitive about New
Zealanders. New Zealand is already
thick with Melbourne gold cups. The
last Victorian horse to win the Mel-
bourne Cup was Wodalla in 1952. It’s
almost as bad as the Miss Australia
quest. The last time a Victorian girl
became Miss Australia was in 1952.
There’s something terribly wrong with
the breeding in this State. Our horses
and Miss Australia girls must be get-
ting the wrong feed or something.
However, just when we were on
the point of breaking off relations
with New Zealand Mr Ross Grey
Smith, chairman of the VRC, said
that the cup which went off from the
NZ Tourist Bureau was not the real
thing. It was a show cup, silver cov-
ered with gold and worth, we gathered,
a laughable £3OO compared with £750
for the solid gold real thing.
Now, there’s an interesting story be-
hind this. Until 1960 there was only
one Melbourne Gold Cup. In the cen-
tenary year they had the awful
thought, what if the cup were pinched
or if there was a dead heat? So Drum-
monds the jewellers had to make two.
One of these cups went to New Zea-
land for display purposes.
While it was over there somebody
dropped it and dented it badly. Typi-
cal New Zealand behavior, you see.
They have so many Melbourne Cups
over there that they treat them most
carelessly. So the dented cup had to
be returned to the maker for delicate
repairs. After this incident the VRC
decided there would have to be a
special cup for display purposes.
Drummonds, in their vault, had this
silver cup, an exact replica of the
Melbourne three-handled loving cup.
Over the years it had been used as
a model for making the gold cup. So
they coated it with gold and now, no
doubt, it is on some proud mantel-
piece inscribed with the owner’s name
and the message “Stolen October 23,
1963”.
The surprising thing was that the
day after the theft the cup had to go
to Sydney for the opening of the new
Victorian Government Tourist Bureau
building. Now here was a real pro-
blem. Before they had planned to
send the phony cup but now it had
to be the real thing. It was bad enough
losing a cup on New Zealand terri-
tory, but after the things that had
been said in the Sydney-published
“Current Affairs Bulletin”, to lose the
cup in NSW would have been even
worse.

James the Builder
Man of God and man of property
By ARTHUR MORLEY
After enjoying four decades of ro-
bust middle-age, Brisbane’s durable
Catholic Archbishop, the Most
Rev. Sir James Duhig, KCMG, DD,
seems ready now, at the age of 92, to
slip at last into his 70s. His mood is
typically septuagenarian mellow and
reminiscent, but hopeful that with a little
luck there are still good years ahead.
He still looks forwards as well as
backwards, and he still entertains his
own spacious notions on the human
life-span. Just a week or two ago he had
a cable from New Zealand announcing
the death of an old friend and member
of his age-group, Monsignor Kennedy,
who had been a fellow-student at Rome
way back in the 1890 s. Dr Duhig was
saddened.
But most of all he was shocked to
learn that his friend would not, after all,
make old bones. He shook his head in
surprise. “I always remembered Kennedy
as a hale and healthy man,” he said.
“I would have thought that he had a long
lease of life ...”
Dr Duhig himself, also a hale and
healthy man for most of his life, is now
in the evening of a career that has
been in many ways unprecedented in
the Catholic Church in Australia. Maybe
it couldn’t have happened anywhere else
but in Queensland.
He first came to public prominence as
something of a boy wonder of the
Church when he was consecrated Bishop
of Rockhampton in 1905, at the age of
34. He was then the youngest bishop
in all Christendom (and, incidentally, the
first bishop appointed by Pope Pius X,
who has since been canonised as a saint).
He has survived to become the Senior
Bishop of all Christendom. Archbishop
Mannix of Melbourne is older, but Arch-
bishop Duhig has been a bishop for
seven years longer.
Since 1959, when he received the
KCMG in the Birthday Honors list,
Dr Duhig has been the only knight in
the Catholic hierarchy in Australia
and one of the two present-day Catholic
bishops in the world to be knighted (the
other, Most Rev. Sir Michael Gonzi,
Archbishop of Malta, was knighted by
George VI for his services to Malta
during World War II).
Dr Duhig has also received the Gold
Medal of the Royal Geographical So-
ciety, Honorary Degrees of Doctor of
Laws from the Universities of Queens-
land, Ottawa, and Dublin, and appoint-
ment as Assistant at the Papal Throne
in 1950.
He has lived under eight Popes and
six Sovereigns, from Victoria to Eliza-
beth 11. His attitude to the Royal family
has grown two-sided over the years,
combining the loyalty and respect of a
subject with something of the warmth of
a family friend.
He has met and talked with George
VI, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother,
Elizabeth 11, Prince Philip, and Princess
Margaret. He has come to regard Prin-
cess Margaret as a special favorite. He
hastened to send her a wedding present,
and he follows her doings closely in the
newspapers.
When Queen Mary died, Dr Duhig
automatically thought in terms of family.
He sent his cable of condolence to the
Duke of Windsor, explaining: “He is
the one who will feel it most ...”
Of all the titles that have come to
him through the years, the one that
seems to give him greatest pleasure now
was bestowed unofficially by his fellow-
citizens of Queensland “James the
Builder.”
It has been a peculiarity of Brisbane
that it has tended to produce better
builders than buildings. Sir Manuel
Hornibrook, for example, is well known
for his work south of the border and
is now grappling with the problems of
the Sydney Opera House roof. Thiess
Brothers of Brisbane are raising monu-
ments to themselves throughout Aus-
tralia.
But Dr Duhig is one Brisbane builder
who does his building at home on a
lavish, imperial scale that sets the pace
for other dioceses. Brisbane Catholics
keep the score of the Archbishop’s build-
ings rather as other people compile sport-
ing records.
At the last count, the list was:
9 boys’ colleges,
1 seminary,
75 convents,
175 churches,
60 presbyteries,
85 convent schools,
2 university colleges,
12 other institutions.
And of course the end is not yet. Sir
James retains his keen nose for real
estate bargains, and a small procession
of estate agents still comes and goes
in the rambling Episcopal Palace, Wyn-
berg, at New Farm, a few miles from
the centre of Brisbane. They are rarely
denied audience.
Real estate is a passion which Sir
James no longer bothers to disguise.
There is no telling when he will decide
to drive out to look at a desirable area
of scrub land that might in time be
encompassed by the suburban sprawl and

offer site for a new church or school.
Throughout the years he could have
been seen on many a suburban hilltop,
robes flapping in the breeze, striding
to and fro to take in the view and assess
the prospects of future development. This
habit has become the despair of shrewder
Catholic laymen, who estimate that estate
agents add another 25 per cent to the
price whenever they learn that Sir James
has been out to have a look.
Serenely Confident
HThe late T. C. Beirne, one of Brisbane’s
merchant princes and a prominent
Catholic layman, once pointedly re-
marked in a speech that whenever HE
was thinking of buying land, he always
sent somebody else out to do the in-
specting, so as not to inflate the market.
But Sir James is serenely confident
that his buying over the years has been
shrewd, timely, and necessary. And of
course the figures support him. The
general trend of values has been upwards
since the war.
“Many people tell me I should have
been in the real estate business,” he
says now. “I know I’d have made a lot
of money.”
One block of 30 acres that he bought
years ago at suburban Mt Gravatt for
£650 would now bring more than
£lOOO for a 66-ft. frontage. A 21-acre
block at Mt Gravatt that he bought for
£llOO is now worth £l2OO to £l5OO
an allotment. On another suburban block
he was offered a quick profit of £30,000.
Typically, he declined to sell.
On some areas he has opened whole
new communities by buying tracts of
land, keeping what he wanted for church
purposes, and throwing the remainder on
the market for sale as private building
blocks. When the people came, church
and school was all there, ready.
In this, as in other directions, Sir
James regards his work as being far
from finished. He told me this week at
Wynberg, with a wave of his hand to
indicate distance, that there was a lot
more land here and there, “way out”
and in the right places, waiting for the
future. Where it was, he declined to
say. Time would tell.
“I have been able to pioneer many
things in the Church here,” he said.
“Pioneering and building are still going
on ... ”
In building, as in real estate, he has
moved forward with an unwavering sense
of mission. To promote the physical
growth of the Church he has argued,
pleaded, persuaded, and ordered. The
ecclesiastical architecture on a score of
Brisbane hilltops might be regarded as
petrified Duhig eloquence.
To his mind, no building is ever
completed and no programme ter-
minated. The mortar is barely dry in a
new church before he considers the
possibilities of enlargement.
His performance recently at the open-
ing of the new church at Geebung, a
Brisbane suburb, was indicative of this.
Here, with the parishioners grouped
around, conscious of achievement and
perhaps expecting a little praise for the
work they had done, Sir James rose to
speak.
First, the modest disavowal . . . “when
I purchased the Wavell Heights property
several years ago, I had not the remotest
idea that in a comparatively short time
not only would Wavell Heights have
matured into a fine self-supporting
parish carrying large Sunday congrega-
tions and a school with 1000 children
in attendance, but that it would be neces-
sary to establish a new parish here in
Geebung to provide for the growing
population of the district. But that is
exactly what happened ...”
Then the appeal ... “I trust that
generosity will be a feature of the initial
ceremony here today ...”
And finally the suggestion that the new
church, still in process of being opened,
might in some ways be considered al-
ready out of date . . . “Each church and
school that we build is quickly filled.
Indeed, they are scarcely completed be-
fore they call for enlargement, and that,
I feel sure, will be the case with this
growing district of Geebung ...”
This drive, and these techniques, pro-
vide much of the explanation for the ex-
pansion of Roman Catholicism in
Queensland. When he succeeded to the
See of Brisbane in 1917, the basis of
the Church was the relatively small Irish
immigrant population and its first-
generation descendants. Parish churches
were few, and missionary work almost
non-existent.
Since then, Sir James has supervised
the construction of more than 400
Church buildings, spent more than
£100,000,000 on Catholic education,
introduced teaching, nursing, missionary,
and contemplative orders, and guided the
growth of the Catholic community to a
total of almost 350,000. He helped give
Catholicism a new vitality and (leaving
aside entirely all theological questions)
a new social tone,
But what is surprising is not so much
the degree of growth as the fact that it
has been accomplished without excessive
inter-denominational friction, and with
a minimum of bitterness. The sectarian-
ism which was such a feature of Queens-
land life 25 years ago has gradually but
surely subsided.
This is not to say that all members of
other Queensland churches welcome the
growing strength and influence of
Catholicism. This is a competitive world,
and there is nothing in the training and
background of Anglican and Noncon-
formist Christians to make them turn
all of a sudden and with unrestrained
affection to Rome.
But precious little of the competitive
resentment that may be felt is directed
towards Dr Duhig personally. He has
come now to be generally regarded as
standing above the battle, the Grand
Old Man of Queensland. Only a hard-
core minority would now deny his
prestige.
To this growing spirit of tolerance
north of the Tweed many churchmen
have contributed. The Anglican leaders
Archbishop Wand and Archbishop Halse
were notable apostles of tolerance, as
many other churchmen have been. But
at least Dr Duhig has always demon-
strated his willingness to meet them half-
way.
While reserving the right to advance
the interests of his own faith, he has
made a personal crusade of anti-sec-
tarianism. You can still strike fire from
him by mentioning the word.
“Sectarian bitterness is a bad thing,” he
told me this week at Wynberg. His
voice rose: “The old hates were imported
into this country. They are not Aus-
tralian, and Australians will not tolerate
them. They will die out; you will
see . . . ”
Both the Catholic Archbishop Duhig
and the Anglican Archbishop Halse for
years publicly demonstrated their friend-
ship. On public occasions they sat side
by side, and often walked arm in arm.
“Archbishop Halse’s death was a great
loss to Queensland,” Dr Duhig says
now. “How I regretted his passing.”
Dr Duhig these days permits himself
some striking demonstrations of his own
tolerance, in ways that would have been
impossible just a few years back. He
recently went along to the Church of
England Grammar School to join a wel-
come to Anglican Archbishop Strong on
the eve of his enthronement.
In this setting and with this audience,
the greatest ovation of the night went-to
Dr Duhig as he rose to speak. In the
course of his speech, he recommended
the clergy present to read the pastoral
letters of one of Archbishop Strong’s
predecessors, (Anglican) Bishop Webber,
“not only for the sound spiritual advice
they contain, but also for the wonderful
command of English expression, which
today is often neglected.”

Business
goes modern
There’s probably been as startling a
change in the last twenty years in
business organisation and methods as
there has in the field of space research.
Twenty years ago it was still acceptable
to think of a clerk as a rusty little man
on a high stool. A salesman was some-
body who called on you. A secretary sat
taking dictation. Personnel selection was
called job interviewing in those far-off
days, and involved a committee or a
succession of interviews with an applicant.
And important discussions, conversations
with legal consequences, had to be fol-
lowed up by a letter to make sure the
points were duly registered.
The recent rapid and sweeping changes
in business methods are a result of the
immense amount of electronic work
developed during World War II. It’s
taken some while for the techniques of
tele-communication to percolate down
from Government agencies into the big
international firms and thence to smaller,
more individually run companies—but
automated, electronic business methods
are now with us —and to judge from
recent spectacular increases in equipment
sales, they’re here to stay.
Because of major advances in transistor
equipment typists now work from taped
dictation —releasing the boss for other
work, saving his secretary waiting through
his phone calls and appointments.
Speeches to conferences need no longer
be made in person—they can be pre-
recorded. Market research, production
reports, appraisements, interviews with
applicants for jobs, salesmen’s briefings,
all can be kept on tape, and used over
and over again.
A thriving new tertiary industry is the
distribution on rental of information film-
strips, to which firms can put their own
recorded commentary relating what is
seen to their own operations. And many
an executive has got into the habit of
switching on a microphone as he makes
an important phone call, so he has his
own permanent record of what he said.
With the latest battery operated tape
recorders, . the executive finds himself
taking his recorder home with him as
well as his brief case.
In all the multifarious daily output of
words in meetings, conferences, surveys,
reports and discussions, the tape recorder
is proving to be the biggest time-saver
since the invention of the typewriter and
the telephone. It is, in point of fact, a
new medium of communication.
And, on the factory floor, in time and
motion study, operatives’ training
schemes, automatic alarm instructions,
noise measurements and music in work
time, the tape recorder is also proving to
be the Works Manager’s best friend.


And so it is now that the stream
of people who present themselves at
Wynberg now for advice, the “loan” of a
few pounds, or the train fare home, con-
tain a fair sprinkling of non-Catholics (the
technical expression for this manoeuvre
is to “go down and see Jimmy”). Sir
James is well aware of the humor of it,
and he smiles as he explains: “You
can’t turn a needy man down. Not just
because of his religion. . . ”
The Edwardian side
VI/’hat is Sir James really like, as a
person? An unusual and even im-
probable mixture of attitudes and
abilities. In terms of fiction, you could
imagine him best as the result of col-
laboration between Galsworthy and
Gogarty an amalgam of Edwardian
man of property and emotional Irish-
man.
The Edwardian has been uppermost in
recent years, and is manifest in political
and social conservatism, respect for the
Establishment, pleasure and pride in the
acquaintance of prominent people,
awareness of the importance of property
and private enterprise, a distrust of
stilt heels and slacks for women and
of most political “isms.” He is a patron
of the arts and a great worker for educa-
tion (he has been member of the Senate
of the University of Queensland since its
foundation, and received his KCMG
for “services to education”).
The Edwardian attributes are seen at
their best in committee work, where there
is solid business to be done and no
audience to be swayed by the flourishes
of oratory.
He has been roped in to contribute to
many community projects not at all
connected with Church work. One such
occasion was a big committee meeting in
the old Legislative Council Chamber in
Brisbane to plan Brisbane’s celebration
of the State’s Centenary in 1959.
Speaker after speaker gave his pro-
posals for decorations and dinners,
pageants and pastries, frills and flags.
And when they had finished, Dr Duhig
stood up. “Yes,” he said in his deep
Irish brogue, “and when it is all over,
what will you have left to show for it?
Let us build something that will stand
as a memorial to this great occasion ...”
It was the solid Edwardian, the man
of property . . .
The counter-balancing Irish element
comes out in many ways in his bursts
of generosity, his genuine warmth and
impulsiveness, his shrewdness, and his
willingness to take a chance. The good
fairies were there at his Limerick birth-
place to give most of the virtues of his
race.
The one thing they seemed to with-
hold was the Irish ability to spin a good
yarn. Sir James has been one of Aus-
tralia’s most effective orators in his day,
a big and impressive figure with a
resonant voice and a great command of
words and argument. But the art of
story-telling has just evaded him.
Perhaps it is because he has never had
time to sit at night just yarning with
cronies. He has never had time for chess
or cards or any such recreations. What-
ever the cause, his humorous stories
and anecdotes just miss out. Maybe the
timing is wrong, or he forgets the key
word, or he finishes before he gets
quite to the point. Something goes
wrong.
On the other hand, there is no doubt-
ing the Irish quality of the impulsive
generosity. He gives away paintings
almost as fast as he acquires them.
Occasionally, as another man would go
on a spree, he gives away a set of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica, and glows
with pleasure.
And he can’t resist giving treats to
children. Visiting Catholic schools, he
dives his hands into a pocket and pro-
duces money for the children to go to
the nearest shop to buy “ice-creams and
lollies”. The procedure varies. Some-
times he may send a secretary across to
buy some treat, sometimes he even takes
the children across to a nearby shop
himself and stands beaming amid a swirl
of youngsters.
Probably part of his Irish inheritance,
too, is the occasional willingness to back
his instincts in the matter of long-shot
investment. He took a flyer in Roma
Oil, way back in the days when oil was
just a hopeful glint in a few Queensland
eyes. Perhaps if that investment had
succeeded, the new Brisbane Holy Name
Cathedral might have been built by now.
He also has been interested in gold,
and the modest backing received by some
prospectors could perhaps be traced, by
anybody interested enough, back to the
draughty corridors of Wynberg.
As a churchman whose interests have
been pastoral rather than political, Dr
Duhig has held himself aloof, relatively
speaking, from the hurly-burly of
politics. Though he has strong views on
the justice of State aid to church schools,
he has not sought to force this issue to
the point of a show-down.
When he does move into the field of
politics, however, his forays can only be
described in terms of 19th-century
surgery swift, bloody and decisive.
One such foray that comes to Queens-
land minds was during the 1949 Federal
election, when socialism was being
debated and bank nationalisation was in
the air. Despite the traditional sympathy
between the Church and Labor in this
State, Dr Duhig granted an interview to
“The Courier - Mail” that pulled no
punches at all:
“Today, every serious student of our
times and conditions must realise that
Labor is in danger of being misled by
cunning, designing people, whose charac-
teristics are lust for power and hatred of
any rule or economic system but their
own, and that it needs wise and
courageous leadership.
“. . . I hold strong views on the matter
and do not fear to express them. I
believe that if socialisation continues to
grow in Australia it will be the death
knell of free enterprise, which has been
found to be the only sane mode of
developing the resources of a country.
“Many socialised or nationalised in-
dustries have failed to pay their way,
and the loss has to be made good by the
people. It is quite unfair to have
nationalised enterprises competing with
private or company enterprises to make
up the leeway ...”
The election that followed shortly
afterwards resulted in the defeat of the
Labor Government led by Mr J. B.
Chifley, and the return of the Menzies
Government. Nobody can accurately
estimate the effect of the Duhig state-
ment but it is perhaps significant that
the greatest swing against Labor was in
Dr Duhig's own State . . .
Looking back now, Dr Duhig ex-
presses gratitude that Providence guided
him to this country to take up his life’s
work. He was born in County Limerick,
Ireland, in 1871, one of seven children,
and his family formed part of the great
wave of emigration from Ireland in the
1880 s. His father died when he was
four years old, and his widowed mother
took the children first to stay with
relatives in Yorkshire, and later to
Australia.

looking Irish lad became a prominent
member of the Catholic Literary and
Debating Society (where he made his
first efforts at public speaking), and
came under the notice of the late Arch-
bishop Dunne, who sent him to Rome to
enter the Irish College.
His rector at the College was Dr Kelly
(later Archbishop Kelly of Sydney, who
was to consecrate James Duhig as Bishop
of Rockhampton). He was ordained in
1896, took degrees in divinity, and re-
turned to Brisbane in the following year.
His first appointment was to Ipswich,
to assist Father Andrew Horan. It so
happened that the parish was organising
a fund to build the new parish church
of St Mary. It was a job made to order
for Father Duhig.
The drive and ability of the young
priest greatly impressed Cardinal Moran
and other church dignitaries who went
to Ipswich for the opening ceremonies.
Soon afterwards, in March, 1905, Arch-
bishop Dunne brought Father Duhig to
Brisbane to be administrator of St
Stephen’s Cathedral. Before the year was
out, Pope Pius X named him Bishop of
Rockhampton. He was not 34 when the
news arrived.
The career continued as it had begun,
with Bishop Duhig bringing tremendous
energies and organising ability to bear on
the tasks of expansion and building. In
February, 1912, he was translated to
Brisbane as Coadjutor Archbishop, with
right of succession to Dr Dunne. He
became Archbishop in 1917, when Dr
Dunne died . . .
At Wynberg now, though he is still
recovering from a major operation, Dr
Duhig makes few concessions to his age.
His appetite is good (though he is not
very interested in what he eats); he sleeps
well, his sight is keen. He manages to
convince himself that his hearing is as
good as ever (people speak more softly
than they used to, and they mumble a
lot more). He still manages a 15-hour
day (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.), broken by an
afternoon siesta.
He is active enough mentally to deal
with the daily callers, and to give atten-
tion to church affairs. He can still speak
well in public when need arises, but not
with the same degree of concentration.
He is more apt now to look up from his
written text, speak off the cuff, and then,
like many other speakers, have a little
trouble picking up the text in the right
place.
But he still has the same old passion
for words, and plays the game, when
driving through the city of analysing the
phrasing of hoarding advertisements. He
still pounces on a wrongly-used word
(“they say ‘want’, when they mean
‘need’ ”), and he is one of the few people
who really trouble themselves with the
old distinction between shall and will.
He remains an insatiable reader, and
takes “The Courier-Mail”, Brisbane
“Telegraph” and “Sydney Morning
Herald” daily, plus The Bulletin,
“Time,” and church papers from
throughout Australia, Britain, and the
United States. He orders and skims
through mountains of books (all non-
fiction).
He sits in his office in a worn and com-
fortable chair, surrounded by an un-
believable clutter paintings on wall,
floor, and propped against the fireplace.
His desk is covered with papers and
books, piled up to a central ridge from
which small avalanches slide from time
to time.
He is serene, reasonably contented, and
human enough to be conscious that with
God’s guidance the farm boy from
County Limerick has come a long, long
way.
“The thing I value most,” he says,
“is the privilege of living in this country.
This is a great country and this is a
great State. It will get greater now that
we have found oil. I look forward to
seeing great development.
“The Queensland people have been
very kind to me, and I can say that I
have never had a misunderstanding with
any section of this community. I have
enjoyed it all.”
Did he know that he was called “James
the Builder”?
This brought him upright in his chair.
“Ah, now,” he said, “not only did I
build, but I found the sites and bought
the land. And we have more of it, miles
out.” He relaxed again. “I am proud to
speak as an Australian citizen, I have
very happy recollections of my relation-
ship with my fellow-citizens, regardless
of creed. I want to say again that
sectarianism is not an Australian growth,
and Australians will not tolerate it.
“I just want to say that I could not
have selected a better country to live in.
And you will see it grow. I look forward
to seeing it grow . .


OUT AND ABOUT
Barefoot in the Outback
"The way we do things out here "
By BOBBY NELSON
A small dam in the creek makes a
watering place for stock. Soft mud
builds up against the dam. Cattle
come to drink. Every week a few head
get bogged in the mud and can’t get out.
In July, Roy and his five black boys
hauled out 12 carcases with their horses.
Then Roy wanted cartridges, to shoot
the ones not properly dead.
“No bloody fear,” the station manager
said, “we ain’t wasting no bullets for
that. Crikey, they’re going to die
anyway!”
So the cattle die quietly. Without
making a sound. And even if they did,
there would be no one to hear. The
country is empty of people. Only mulga
and dry spinifex. And a flat land of end-
less time. Here and there: an empty rib
cage, a horned skull, the track of a wild
’roo being covered by a fine and steady
drift of red sand.
The creek goes south. When it be-
comes thick and still, it reaches the out-
back town: a handful of wooden-and-
tin shapes on the sides of a highway, a
few specks bleaching in the waste.
During the heat of the day, you can
hear a loose board whisper in an old
wall. You can see a hawk circle for
hours and find no prey. Goats list along
a sparse stubble near the creek. The
dusty pub is empty.
At one end of town a young man
stands with his swag and tries to hitch
a ride. His nose is blistered and peeled.
Flies swarm about him. They crawl in
his ears, tickle across his lips, and nestle
in the moist corners of his eyes. He
brushes at them for hours and fights
them until he is nearly frantic. Finally
he builds a fire and stands with his face
in the smoke, eyes blinking and watery
tears running down both cheeks.
There are no clouds. The sun goes
hard across a bleak sky and sets without
color. Then magically, a bright red haze
forms along the western horizon and
hangs onto the edge of the world for a
long while. Flies disappear, the dusk is
cooling and pleasant. Stars begin to peck
at the sky. The town tries to find its feet.
There’s a rustle of men in the pub; an
occasional eater in the small cafe.
Roy has come to town as he does
every four months. His face as plain as
a slab of crusted damper. His ears, like
the droopy leaves of a bloodwood. He
takes off his boots in the pub and sits
barefooted on the end stool. The owner
serves him steady glasses of beer and,
once, wipes the sop from the bar. They
don’t talk. The light bulb overhead is
yellow and weak.
A schoolteacher sits in the corner of
the pub. Young, just out of Teachers’
Training College, plaid stove-pipe pants
and button-down collar, he imitates a
jazz drummer and beats on the bar
with his hands. His eyes are closed
and he nods and humps his shoulders
with the rhythm. Spasmodically, he
sings out, “You’re gonna find someone
who’ll set you back on your heels
Goody-Goody!” He sings loud and
fast, pushes the rhythm and goes to
town on the drums. He wails, “Oh man,
listen to that cat blow! That’s swinging,
yeah! Oh man that’s sweet!..
Roy doesn’t seem to notice. The
schoolteacher was doing the same thing
last time Roy was in town.
After taking plenty of time for about
15 beers, Roy walks barefooted to the
little cafe a few yards down the street.
It has a floor of rough planks and six
wooden booths painted royal blue. He
sits in one of the booths. His white shirt
has been washed by hand and is worn
unironed. It looks smooth and grey
against the blue wood.
Half-caste Maisie waits on him and
keeps her eyes looking shyly at the floor.
She has a pert sway in her back, high
hard hips, and extremely thin legs. She
also has golden-colored skin.
Roy reckons he’ll have steak and eggs.
Outside, Little Bit Alright squats on
his haunches next to the door like a glum
chess piece. One of Roy’s black fella
stockmen. He wears a brilliant yellow
cowboy shirt, a huge hat curled to point
in front, and ragged boots with slits in
the sides where his toes bulge. Places on
his black arms are chalky with streaks
of old dirt. In his whole life, he has
never had a bath.
When the smell of him carries inside
the cafe, Maisie calls out, “Hey Little
Bit, more better you move downwind.
You stink um nobody can eat.” She
frowns to herself: “Black fellas they
never been proper washing like us white
fellas. They not clean like us.” She sits
on the flour-box, thumbs through the
pages of an old fashion magazine, and
looks at the pictures of pretty clothes.
Roy’s steak is cooked to a frazzle.
The same as all steaks are cooked in the
outback. He cuts it with the knife held
like a dagger, slowly chews, and, even
more slowly, drinks his tea with heaps
of sugar. When he’s finished, he wipes
his mouth with the back of his hand and
rolls a cigarette from a tin of ready-
rubbed. The smoke rises almost without
a waver and purls heavily against the
ceiling.
A mail-order catalogue for stockmen
is in his back pocket. He pulls it out and

looks once again at the new style pointy-
toe boots. When he first saw them he
didn’t like them. They seemed too flash.
But, now, the more he looks, the more
they begin to appeal. For a moment, he
almost decides to order them. Then,
abruptly, he stops his decision. No. The
old round toes have done him for 20
years. He’ll stick with them another ten.
Plenty of time before making a change.
He looks past the booths and into the
kitchen. Maisie’s profile is outlined
against the white ’fridge. Her nose is a
little wide, but she has nice eyes and full
lips. Her skin looks fresh and soft.
When he pays at the counter, Maisie
counts out the change.
He asks her, “You doing anything
after you close?”
“Maybe. Why you ask?” She keeps her
eyes on the lollies between them.
“Well, I thought if you wasn’t busy
we could have a little fun.”
She giggles.
“Maybe you could meet me down at
the creek —”
“You very cheeky.”
“I ain’t cheeky. I’m just putting the
hard word on you.”
“Oh Roy, you one fella proper
naughty.”
“Well, how ’bout it?”
She doesn’t answer —she only smiles.
Roy goes back to the pub. His bare
feet walk lightly over the small rocks.
Soon, Little Bit Alright goes to the
back door of the cafe and buys a piece
of raw meat for four-bob. He takes it
to the end of town where he has a
blanket, a billy-can, and a small bag of
tea. He gets water from the brown creek,
builds a fire, and boils the billy.
The young hitch-hiker, still waiting
beside the highway, watches the fire in
the dark for a long time. He sees the
meat sizzling on the red coals and almost
smells the hot tea.
Next to Nowhere
TTe comes over. “Excuse me,” he says,
“I hate to ask, but if you can spare
something to eat, I’d be very grateful. I’m
frightfully hungry.” In the firelight his
peeled nose looks scabby and his smoked
eyes are pink.
“You want eat?” Little Bit Alright
grins.
“I haven’t had a bite all day. I’ve
been trying to catch a ride, but only five
cars passed and nobody stopped. There’s
no railway. No buses. No nothing. I’m
stranded out here next to nowhere and
I'm nearly desperate.”
Little Bit Alright pokes a stick in the
meat and hands it to the young man. He
also hands over the whole billy of tea:
“Here, you eat um good. Fill um up.”
The young man savages the meat and,
then, with his mouth full, “You haven’t
any left for yourself—?”
“You eat um. Then you no more
hungry.” Little Bit’s teeth smile very
white in his black face in the black night.
The aborigine feeding a white man. The
scene could easily be a hundred years old.
The young man chomps on without
hesitation. He downs the meat and gulps
at the tea right out of the ashened billy.
“I wanted to see the country,” he says.
“Started from Sydney, and the farther I
go the worse it gets. I don’t know how
anyone can stand it. Nothing but dirt
roads and people living in tin sheds. At
home, no one would think of driving a
car over this kind of road, and we only
use tin sheds for keeping pigs in—l’m
from England.”
As Little Bit Alright only grins and
doesn’t acknowledge the remark, the
youth says again: “England—you know
where that is?”
“Endian? Oh yeh. Far ’way. Cross big
water.”
“That’s right. Across the ocean.”
“Endian. You in war.”
“That’s right. War against Hitler. Long
time ago.”
“Oh yeh. I know. You pommy
bastid.”
“I’m an Englishman.”
“Yeh. You Endian. You pommy
bastid.”

“Listen, I appreciate the food, but I
resent that name.”
“You come ’long me. I fix um for

he says to the schoolteacher. “You’ve got

how you act in this town or I’ll have to
run you in.” The constable hiccups and
slops some of the beer out of his glass.
“You couldn’t run a flea in—why
don’t you step outside with me? Huh?
I’ve called you out 20 times and you’re
afraid to come. Because you’re weak.
That’s why. You’re weak as pee.”
“You watch how you talk to me—”
“Aw leave me alone, will ya? All I
want is to talk to somebody about jazz.
You know? Dizzy Gillespie, Mulligan,
Brubeck. There’s nothing in this place.
Even Mt Isa gets Carol’s Varieties and
Edward Bell the Hypnotist. But not here.
It’s enough to drive anyone buggy—
except you. You’re too stupid.”
Roy scratches a bare ankle and hardly
listens. He sees Little Bit Alright motion-
ing at the door and goes outside.
“This fella, him been wanting tucker,
Roy,” Little Bit grins and indicates the
hitch-hiker.
“What’s the trouble?” Roy asks. The
young man stands miserably with his
swag, and tells his small woes.
Roy hands him some money. “Here’s
a coupla quid. Maybe that’ll help you a
bit.”
The youth stammers, “Well, I—that’s
terribly decent of you. But you don’t
know me —”
“That’s all right. That’s the way we do
things out here.”
“I don’t know when I can pay you
back—”
“Don’t worry about it Plenty of
time.”
The pub-doors close at ten, but beer
pours behind the doors as late as any-
one cares to drink. Roy leaves about
midnight and takes his blanket near the
creek where the goats have been.
He lies down and looks up at the stars.
Maybe Maisie will come. Maybe she
won’t. He’s done without women most of
his life. One more night won’t make any
difference.
He thinks vaguely: Maybe someday
the boss will find a way to dredge the
mud from the dam so the cattle don’t
get bogged. Maybe someday I’ll order
those pointy-toe boots. Maybe what
ever, there’s plenty of time.
His bare feet stick out at the end of the
blanket and look very bony and dead.
Stars cover the whole world and, it
seems, to Roy, he sleeps under all the
stars.
The Night-Club Dors
Learning her lessons in the big cruel world
By JAN SMITH
As Miss Dors would have said, it
was a real swinging Press recep-
tion up there in the lush tundras
of the Sydney Chevron’s 13th floor. Her
manager, Len Bennett, would normally
have been there to keep everything run-
ning smoothly but he was in bed, one
floor below, with a troublesome small-
pox injection. Mr Bennett, a former
guitarist, looked extremely young for
such a responsible position. “I was out
here before with Lonnie Donegan,” he
said, giving a broad hint that his visits
ere brought their own problems.
Nevertheless, there were plenty of men
to go around, all brimming with angles
and questions and terribly anxious to
help. “Ask her about the pub she was
going to buy in Henley,” said one
bearded man who knew everything,
“And the book she wrote called ‘Swing-
ing Dors.’ ”
Someone else complained that Miss
Dors was weak on current affairs. He’d
hoped to get some topical quotes on
Lord Home. “Look,” said Miss Dors, “I
don’t take a lot of interest in these
things. I’d rather not . . . ” And always,
f rom the settee where Miss Dors sat in
her black linen, mink stole and silver
nail polish, came the inevitable ques-
tions.
“A sex symbol? Well, I guess I’m still
working that one out. When I first heard
the expression I thought it was some
kind of musical instrument. Maybe it
means different things for different
people.” The sexiest woman in films
today, Miss Dors thought, could be Anna
Magnani. Her definition of glamor? She
was still working, that one out too. Is
the sex symbol being superseded as a
film attraction? There’ll always be room
for it, Miss Dors thought.
Miss Dors had indeed written a book.
She started it while she was pregnant the
first time, three years ago, but in the
rush to get it out before the publication
of her memoirs, she weakly permitted
two beat-up journalists to take over the
job while she went to hospital. She
wished she could have finished it her-
self, as she thinks she has a feeling for
words and on occasions she writes
poetry, just for her own satisfaction
and not modelled on any other style.
Her most recent film, “West Eleven,”
is strictly new wave, produced by Danny
Angel and released last month in Lon-
don to highly favorable notices. Playing
opposite Eric Portman, she appears in

“a pathetic sort of role, pretty sordid,
where I’m searching for my lost youth.
In the end I just fade into oblivion like
those sort of people usually do.”
Sense of humor can be inherited or
acquired and Miss Dors believes very
firmly she was born with one. “It’s got
sharper over the years,” she conceded,
“which is a good thing in this business.
Once you start taking yourself too
seriously the bottle and the dope are
just around the corner. That was
Marilyn’s trouble. Of course, she had
a hell of a life. But I’m an actress first
of all, and I can’t think of anything
more pathetic than trotting around night-
clubs as an ageing sex symbol.”
Miss Dors has been an actress for
18 years, beginning in repertory as a
precocious 14-year-old, already blonde
and with a brand new name in place
of Mary Fluck. Her father was a rail-
way clerk at Swindon, and both parents
encouraged her, as their only child, to
follow her yen for acting. “They sent
me to a drama academy in London,”
Miss Dors recalled. “You know how it
is. You learn a lot of technique but the
real lessons come outside in the big
cruel world.”
Her first role in repertory was a
mermaid in “Miranda,” and her first
film, at 14, “The Shop at Sly Corner.”
“A Kid for Two Farthings,” made when
she was 22, is considered by Miss Dors
to be her second-best picture. It was
directed by Carol Reed, and she thought
it was a shame his reputation had been
largely eclipsed by newer producers like
David Lean. Lean was admittedly the
best around today, but maybe Reed’s
latest film, “Running Man,” would give
him competition.
At 15 she played in “Oliver Twist” as
the girl in the coffin-maker’s shop, after
persuading the director she was years
older. In other films she played
prostitutes, teenage delinquents and
blondes of a certain kind.
She reads anything but favors
biographies—“real people who’ve done
something interesting”—as opposed to
over-rambling fiction. “I liked ‘lmmortal
Queen’ tremendously,” she said. “It’s
the story of Mary Queen of Scots. But
don’t ask me if I want to play Mary
because it’s no good nourishing those
sort of ambitions when no director in
his right mind would cast me.”
Yet her favorite role was a primci
facie case of a director not being in his
right mind. In the film, “Yield to the
Night,” J. Lee Thompson cast her as a
condemned murderess, stripped her of
makeup and tied her hair back with
string, and showed the preceding events
in flashback. It was the only British
film selected that year for the Cannes
Festival, and in her opinion “the best
darn thing I ever did”.
Thompson has long ago found fame
in the United States as a director of
“The Guns of Navarone,” and no one
has really got the best out of Diana
Dors since. “They tried getting me in
the gas chamber again in Hollywood,
in a film with Rod Steiger called
‘Unholy Wife,’ but it wasn’t good. They
edited it badly.”
Miss Dors was married at 19 to play-
boy - entrepreneur Dennis Hamilton,
where the sense of humor must have
come in very handy. “He promoted me
strictly as a sex symbol,” she said,
“never as an actress. But it served its
purpose and at the time it was fun.”
Hamilton’s promotion resulted in push-
ing her into swimming pools, inciting
writs against RKO, and encouraging her
to ride a pink bicycle. They lived in
palatially vulgar houses and held seances.
She made the first pink plastic disc in
recording history and when it was all
over got £36,000 for her confessions.
After Hamilton’s death she married
English comedian Dickie Dawson, who
sings and jokes in American West Coast
nightspots. They have two children,
Mark, 3i, and Gary, 1. Now 32, she
has spent the last three and a half years
living in Hollywood, acquiring an inter-
national accent and continuing her night-
club tours in England, Europe, South
Africa and South America.
11/l iss Dors has been a nightclub enter-
tainer for the last five years, and
it is a reflection on Mr Hamilton and
subsequent promoters that a great many
Australians are still wondering what
exactly she does at Chequers, apart
from looking like Diana Dors. “I sing
standard ballads like ‘Angel Eyes’ no
folk stuff —and songs with a swinging
beat. I also do imitations of Eartha Kitt,
Marlene Dietrich, Mae West and Lena
Horne.”
She doesn’t tell jokes, but she does
talk to her audience. “I never have much
trouble with people getting tanked and
heckling me,” she said. “For one thing
I’ve got the microphone, and if you
don’t actually go asking for trouble and
sitting yourself on men’s laps like Jane
Mansfield, nothing much can upset the
act.”
Her closest woman friend is Pamela
Mason, married to but estranged from
James, and mother of the precocious
Portland. “I have quite a lot of women
friends,” Miss Dors said, “and not all of
them are in entertainment or films. I
like women—and men —who are with-
out affectation. Pamela has her own
TV show and just talks to people for
an hour.”
After 18 years of fierce lights and
fan magazine stories, Diana Dors still

Art for Investment’s Sake?
No game for the amateur
By ROBERT HUGHES
f ART - as - investment filled Sydney
t\ drawing-rooms last week: what
would happen to the Terry Clune
Galleries’ auction of modern European
paintings? For the first time, overseas
pictures were being offered in lump on
the Australian market. Frank MacDon-
ald, one of the Gallery’s directors, had
spent four months overseas gathering the
collection —at a reputed cost of £21,000;
Terry Clune told the Press that Austra-
lians had been paying too much, too
often, for “second-grade” local paintings,
and that now, at last, collectors could see
and invest in the real thing.
The real thing, as it turned out, was
mostly School of Paris decoration, forti-
fied by a small Renoir and some litho-
graphs by major painters—Braque, Cha-
gall, Sutherland.
Pictures, the gallery said, were a faster
(if slightly riskier) way to wealth than the
stock market. But the risk could be elim-
inated by buying blue-chip paintings.
And what bluer chips than European
ones? Such was the theory; and it work-
ed, since the auction at Gray’s grossed
nearly £38,000.
Yet most “investments” made that
afternoon were disastrously bad, consid-
ered in terms of current European prices
and reputations. The old adage that you
don’t buy in a market you know nothing
about proved painfully true.
Many of the painters represented in
the auction were unknown in Australia,
or at best dimly and occasionally heard
of, so that buyers had no actual basis of
price-comparison. They bought blind,
without considering the European
market.
Consider, for instance, Bernard Buf-
fet’s 1963 oil “Nature Morte aux Fruits,”
which fetched 3500 guineas.
Its asking price in Paris, through Buf-
fet’s dealer (David & Gamier), would
have been roughly 1300 guineas. How-
ever, after the insurance, packing, fram-
ing and excise expenses on the picture,
no gallery in this country could land
“Nature Morte aux Fruits” here and
make its own cut on the sale at a price
less than 2000 guineas. For the difference
between Buffet’s Paris price and the local
one, its present lucky owner could have
flown first-class to Paris, spent three
weeks in la ville lumiere, taken his pick
of every Buffet in David & Gamier, and
flown back to Sydney. Moral: don't buy
expensive overseas paintings on the local
market. It doesn’t pay.
"CVjrthermore, the record world price
for a Buffet the size of “Nature Morte
aux Fruits” (about three by two feet)
was paid several years ago: 30,000 Dutch
gulden, or about 3500 guineas. This
happened when Buffet was still the enfant
terrible of French art, compulsively loved
by every critic, with stable prices at a
high level. Today, on the other hand,
Buffet's prices are plummeting along
with his reputation. It’s doubtful whether
“Nature Morte aux Fruits”, a very run-
of-the-mill painting even for Buffet, could
command 3,500 dollars on the New York
market next week.
The irrationality of the local buyers
showed itself in other selections. Inex-
plicably, though Bauchant’s primitive
“Fleurs dans une Paysage” brought 250
guineas (one of the few prices in the
auction which was compatible as invest-
ment with European price levels), his
“Nymphes au Bois”, half the size and
a tenth as good a painting, fetched 500!
Another 500 guineas was paid for a
mock-Utrillo street scene of Paris by an
obscure painter named Elisee Maclet—
the sort of painting one gets for
£5O in the Flea Market. The 750
guineas bid for a picture by a minor
cubist, Jean Crotti, is not likely to go up
in later years; and whoever bought the
two effete decorative panels by Bradi
Barth, whose one claim to fame is that
Jackie Kennedy likes her work, can re-
flect that the 475 guineas they each cost
is, on the local market, the price of a
major Olsen, Fairweather or Boyd.
But the oddest aspect of the auction
was the prices paid for lithographs.
One can only assume that the buyers
didn’t know the difference between a
lithograph and a painting. Lithographs,
though signed, are put out in editions of
up to 250. You can buy a Chagall litho-
graph like the three in the Clunes
auction, through the Galerie Maeght in
Paris, for about 45 guineas sterling.
(Four years ago, in London, I paid 25
guineas for one.) Braques are a little
more expensive: Say 60 guineas for one
like "Bouquet”, the 173rd pull from an
edition of 200. A Sutherland lithograph
can be had for as little as £2O.
But the Sydney cognoscenti paid for
the Braque lithograph 375 guineas; for
the Chagalls 500, 475 and 375 guineas
respectively; and for the Sutherland 160
guineas. These must be the highest prices
ever paid for lithographs in the 20th
century. One hopes, for the buyers’ sake,
that they weren't investing their money.
The capital appreciation will indeed be
sluggish.
It’s hard to imagine the motives behind
such an indefensible spree. Presumably
the same competitive hysteria that forced
Dobell’s prices up at the Schureck sale
took over in Gray’s auction rooms last
week. No more than a handful of pic-
tures went for prices as low as their cur-
rent overseas values. For the Marie Laur-
encin portrait 4900 guineas was freakish,
but then Major Rubin was bidding for it.
On the other hand, the 7500 he bid for
the little Renoir was on a par with its
overseas value, about 6000 sterling
guineas. However, it isn’t feasible to sell
overseas paintings in Australia at their
overseas price: the seller has to pay an
import tax of 12i% at the outset. Thus
the Renoir, along with the exquisite little
Hayden (325 guineas), the fine Lurcat
tapestry and no more than five or six
other pictures, was a buyer’s bargain.
Most of the rest, considered as invest-
ment, are likely to prove either straight
losses or shaky ventures. It seems that
the best investment for Australian buyers
still lies in those “second-grade” Aus-
tralian pictures.

Some Things
Never
Change
The dangers of prosperity
By MARTIN SIMPSON
64TTEY, don’t carry those. Get that
rl black son of a sea cow to do it.”
We had just docked in Cape
Town and I was returning to the land
of my birth after an absence of more
than five years. The African referred to
was standing nearby. He looked surly.
“Go on, you black son of a bitch,
carry those bags for the gentleman.”
The African sullenly obeyed, and the
dock official eyed me amiably.
“Bet you don’t have animals like that
where you come from,” he said.
“Now you know you’re back in South
Africa,” the friend who had met me
said with a sigh. “Some things haven’t
changed.” In fact I found that many
things had changed quite considerably.
For one thing South Africa looked far
more prosperous than I had known it
as a boy. The country is at present en-
joying an economic boom and the white
man has never been better off financially.
This prosperity helps the Europeans
retain their illusions about all being well
with the country.
Few really believe that there won’t be
crises in the future, but most people are
hopeful that all racial problems will be
overcome.
In the meanwhile it is as though
those whites who are intelligent have
been partially anaesthetised. They isolate
themselves from the racial problems
around them and their escapism thrives
in the high standard of living they enjoy.
The English-speaking section of the
white population, traditionally more
liberal in its outlook, still decries the
sterner aspects of white supremacy as
practised under the guise of “Apartheid.”
But most whites are now resigned to
throwing in their lot with the Govern-
ment as they see a firm line as their only
hope of salvation. Moreover, many of
the more liberal elements have left the
country to live elsewhere.
The Government remains pledged to
its present policies. “We shall stay here
and give our last drop of blood to main-
tain our birthright,” one Afrikaans friend
said to me.
However, not all white South Africans
are quite so determined. One school-
friend, who recently joined the staff of
a large international company, stated he
did so to ensure a job abroad if he had
to leave South Africa. “Believe me,” he
said, “this country is going to have
fantastic trouble. When it comes I shall
be the first to leave. In the meanwhile
I enjoy luxury as I could in no other
part of the world.”
I spoke to a highly qualified African
about the country’s future.
He is one of the few non-Europeans
to have reached University level, through
the help of an American Mission school.
He was much more restrained than I
would have expected.
“If I were able to vote I would support
the Progressive Party’s policy which
seeks a qualified franchise and envisages
a constitution in which no racial group
could dominate the country. As it is I
have no real representation and the
Nationalist Government heaps insult
after insult on me and my people. I now
need a special pass if I want to visit
Adams, the mission where I went to
school. The Government has done its
utmost to stifle all African advancement.
I do not know what is going to happen,
but I fear the country is in for a blood-
bath. All moderate African opinion has
been silenced and the African people are
a prey to extremists. I foresee catastrophe
for all, black and white alike, but do not
know what I can do about it.”
Tn actual fact the Government policy of
“Apartheid,” ostensibly “Separate
Development”, is one of the most
gigantic boondoggles ever dreamed up as
a vote-catching platform. South Africa
is now more integrated economically
than it has ever been in the past. As one
European recently said, “We need the
blacks and they need us.”
When I recently drove through the
Transkei, the “Bantustan” reserve set
aside for self-government by the Africans,
I expected to find dramatic changes since
I last visited the area nearly six years
ago. Instead, in Umtata, the capital,
everything seemed exactly the same. All
the restaurants and businesses still seemed
to be in the hands of Europeans and the
tribal lands, if anything, looked more
desolate and eroded than before.
In Durban at the modern and
imaginatively designed Ocean Terminal
the inbred contradiction of “Apartheid”
is obvious to the point of absurdity. Out-
side the attractive new restaurant is a
large sign saying, “Whites Only.” Inside,
at slack times of the day, not a white is
to be seen. The only occupants are the
dark-skinned Indian waiters.
I pointed out this contradiction to a
Durban friend.
“There is one word that explains the
politics of this country”, he said. “If you
add it to any situation you will under-
stand everything. That word is ‘Greed’.
Thus, if you ask whether blacks can get
paid the same wages as whites the
answer is ‘No’. In such a situation the
whites must be in a completely ‘separate’
category where ‘job reservation’ applies.
Then he may earn five times as much
as his African counterpart doing exactly
the same work. However, this ‘Separate-
ness’ can only be taken so far. If you
ask whether the African may make the
white man’s bed, clean in the white man’s
house, cook the white man’s food, work
the white man’s mines, look after the
white man's children, or shop in the
white man’s stores, then the answer
is an emphatic ‘Yes’. ‘Greed’ explains
every decision that the Nationalist
Government has ever made in its dealings
with the blacks.”
Sometimes I was asked if I had any
alternative solution for South Africa’s
racial problems. Personally I believe
that 25 years ago, or perhaps even after
the war, time still remained for a reason-
ably equitable solution. In order for the
whites to have assured their future in
South Africa three steps were essential:
• A qualified franchise irrespective of
color. This could have been based on
economic and educational qualifications
and would have ensured that the more
advanced civilisation of the whites was
protected from sudden overthrow by the
black masses. It would also have given
the blacks a chance to develop in re-
sponsibility and a gradually increasing
stake in the running of the country.
6 An enlightened policy, similar to
that undertaken by Australia after the
war, to encourage large-scale immigra-
tion from Europe. At a time when many
Europeans wanted to leave their
shattered homelands, South Africa could
easily have absorbed a large number of
immigrants. Not only would such
immigration have helped the country
develop more rapidly but it would also
have helped to weigh the ratio between
black and whites more evenly. (There
are presently 3 million whites out of a
total population of about 15 million.)

Qantas helps Australian swimsuit manufacturer
scoop the pool with buoyant sales overseas!
Australia really set the pace at the 1963 Men’s and Women’s United States Outdoor
National Swimming Championships, when 100 of the 107 finalists wore Speedo swimsuits!
The company began exporting soon after the Games in Melbourne in 1956, and today
90% of its tremendous export trade goes by air. Speedo speedily replenishes stocks of its
U.S. distributor once a week with Qantas. Freight cost? A scant 6d. per swimsuit, which
retails at up to $6.95. The company’s outlay of capital is low, and its overseas distributors
on all continents benefit from low inventories of Speedo’s handsome medley of 'jet stream’
racing suits. If you’d like to swim with the tide to jet age air cargo, why not talk things
over with Qantas?

Now, with Europe prosperous, and South
Africa in bad odour everywhere on
account of “Apartheid”, the possibility
of large-scale white immigration has
vanished.
• A policy of equal opportunity for
all, irrespective of race. If the South
African Government had tried to iron
out some of the blatant inequalities, there
might have been some chance of recon-
ciling the different race groups. Equal
justice before the law, equal pay for
equal work, and abolition of racial dis-
crimination wherever possible should
have been the objectives of top priority.
Instead the South African Government
has gone the other way. With its policy
of stunting the non-Europeans’ develop-
ment in every way possible it has an-
tagonised more than 80% of the
population.
In addition world opinion has been
alienated at every turn. It is ironic that
probably no policy could have been
calculated to do the country more lasting
harm than the one pursued in the last
few years. Without a doubt “Apartheid”,
and all that it has brought in its train,
has ensured that revolution rather than
evolution takes place.
In my opinion the white policymakers,
in trying to perpetuate all their privi-
leges, are destined to lose everything.
The economy of the country has always
been based on cheap African labor com-
bined with the superior skills of the
whites. In an environment where part-
nership is such an essential ingredient a
policy of “Apartheid” is not only in-
defensible morally but also ludicrous
from an economic standpoint.
The real tragedy of the situation is
that all whites, irrespective of their
political convictions, will suffer equally
in the debacle.
What is more, I believe that, even if
the country’s policies were changed to-
morrow (a highly unlikely occurrence)
it is now too late to avert catastrophe.
As for the future it is difficult to be
categorical concerning the sequence of
events. People have been preaching doom
and gloom in South Africa for so long
now that most South Africans shrug off
dire predictions without a thought. The
Government believes that, with its un-
limited armaments, it can maintain the
status quo indefinitely. The average
South African hopes that, at any rate
for the next 20 years, he need fear
nothing worse than sporadic outbursts
of violence.
In the meanwhile the white popula-
tion lingers on in South Africa like a bird
hypnotized by the approach of a snake.
Oblivion is near and yet outwardly all
is still well. How long remains before
the bird either flies away or is consumed
only time will tell.


State Premiers —2
WILLIAM HOLMAN
The stage lost a fine Hamlet ...
By MALCOLM ELLIS
Somebody once said that when Wil-
liam Arthur Holman took to politics
the stage lost a fine Hamlet a
role Tn which The Bulletin was prone
to cartoon him. He was born in 1870.
His theatrical family brought him to
Australia in 1888 and apprenticed him
to a cabinet-maker in Darlington (Syd-
ney). He made little progress as an
artisan, but a lot as a student of Marx,
Mill, Huxley, Spencer and Darwin; of
Potter’s translations of Greek drama,
which taught him the art of timing and
dramatic effect; and of Stevenson, from
whom, he said, he learned how to
handle words. Later he spoke French
fluently, read the French philosophers
and poets, and wore proudly his Legion
of Honor rosette.
He naturally graduated to the old
School of Arts Debating Society, the
haunt of every able political speaker in
Sydney. And he entered politics as a
starry-eyed 20-year-old in one of the first
of the mushroom crop of Single Tax
leagues which sprang up in 1890, during
and after the visit of Henry George. This
was at Balmain, and the two other guid-
ing spirits were W. M. Hughes and
George Beeby, a rotund theorist who was
to play a considerable part in his life.
Within two years he was plunging into
Socialism; within three he was a member
of the freshly fledged Political Labor
League, and its delegate from Leichhardt,
which had nominated him as its candidate
for the next State elections. With J. C.
Watson and others he was forcing the
idea of the Labor pledge on prospective
candidates.
At 24 he had been seen at the Sydney
Town Hall, joining the swarthy W. G.
Higgs in persuading a majority to pledge
themselves to the foundation of a United
States of Australia republic governed by
a single House.
A young man very Wellsian in appear-
ance, by the time he had passed through
his 25th year he had accumulated a lot
of experience, mostly disheartening. He
had twice learned the bitterness of defeat,
firstly in the rat race of a contested
electorate of Leichhardt and then in the
country electorate of Grenfell. There,
with the aid of a bicycle and a journ-
alistic trumpet called the “Grenfell
Vedette”, purchased with his father’s
help and printed on an Albion press
which occasionally plunged through the
floor, he propagated the gospel that he
was God’s gift to the electors. That was
the only principle on which the “Vedette”
stood firm.
He had also learned the way of the
Crown with youths who were careless
in their methods of what Shakespeare
called “extorting treasure” from hopeful
investors. Having joined with two other
publicists one a fellow who had been
fined for having inscribed the words
“Gone Bung!” on the doors of the
Government Savings Bank during the
1893 bank crisis in enlightening the
public through an organ known as the
“Daily Post,” he found himself with
some co-directors under sentence to a
couple of years in Darlinghurst for fraud.
The judge conceded that no question
of personal gain was involved, that it
had all been due to carelessness, over-
optimism and lack of business capacity;
but still, there had been fraud and some-
body had suffered. Luckily, his Honor
made a slip in refusing to let the accused
make statements from the dock before
defence witnesses were called, and the
Full Court quashed the trial after the
culprits had served only eight weeks in
Darlinghurst. Young Holman spent many
years paying back the aggrieved creditors
but every now and then, as when he
applied for admission to the Bar, his
enemies rose up and held the record
against him.
The Political Labor League,' however,
did not. Shortly after his release he was
chosen as one of Labor’s ten candidates
to contest the election to the Federal
Convention of 1897. He polled a very
low vote as a preliminary to winning the
Grenfell seat in the Legislative Assembly
for Labor on June 3, 1898 this despite
Cardinal Moran’s commination against
Socialists. Soon he was up to his neck in
the anti-Federal campaign, a very vocal
State-righter.
Furthermore, he was one of the leaders
of the Party, a member of the “Solid Six”
which had George Reid replaced by the
incredible “Oom Paul” Lyne with his
even more incredible gang of followers,
including the noisy Crick.
Overnight these deadly enemies of
Labor had turned into fairy godfathers
oozing Old Age Pension Acts, Truck
Acts, Coal Lumper’s Basket Acts, Attach-
ment of Wages Acts, union wages for
civil servants, a labor employment bur-
eau with an ex-Labor member as presi-
dent, and a rise of Is. a day in the daily
wage-rate.
Fortunately for Lyne, he was able to
depart for fresh fields in the new Federal
Parliament when Holman was in his 31st
year, along with W. M. Hughes,’ J. C.
Watson, W. G. Spence, Josiah Thomas
and David Watkins of the Labor Party
tagging along behind. This left Holman
looking larger than life in the party of
ATTORNEY-GENERAL HOLMAN,
N.S.W.
As Low saw him in 1911.

...why Ford-built cars win
Australia’s top track and
trial events, why it means
more car for your money!
Total performance is something you find only
in Ford-built cars. It’s the reason why Fords
win more of Australia’s top motor races, trials
and rallies than all other makes combined.
It’s an unbeatable combination of power,
balance, braking, strength and road-holding.
And it’s built into every Ford-built car.
1963 Armstrong 500. Cortina’s “first across
the line” performance in the 1963 Armstrong
500 is latest evidence of what total performance
means. How, against 56 other cars it kept
going, and going, and going where 15 others
were forced to stop altogether.
Australia’s toughest trials. Falcon’s un-
matched record in reliability trials also attests
to total performance. It beat all-comers in the
most gruelling and car-tearing trials of all —
the BP Rally and Akedemos "Hell” Trial, just
to mention two. It was also first across the
line in the 1962 Armstrong 500 (No Falcons
were entered in the 1963 event.)
Why Ford enters. Why Ford’s interest in
auto races and trials? Two reasons ! One, to
prove to the public that Ford can build cars
that will outperform and outlast any com-
petitive makes. Second, to learn from this
experience how to improve even further the
breed of its cars. Ford knows that nothing
tests or proves a car like open competition.
No automotive proving ground can duplicate
the brutal punishment and tortuous condi-
tions of events like the Armstrong 500 marathon
and the BP Rally — and Ford’s achievements
proves the extra performance, braking, balance,
and durability you buy when you buy Ford.
More for your money. You do not have to be
a “pro” driver to get the benefits of Ford’s
total performance. Get behind the wheel of
any Ford and you’ll immediately notice how it
has eagerly responsive power, braking ability
to match, steering that’s effortless and true,
and road-holding that lets you corner flat
and snug.
How much are these attributes worth in a car?
A lot. After all you buy a car to drive it. And
if a car can give you more pleasure behind the
wheel, mere exhilaration and zest when driving,
you’re getting more out of your car for your
money.
A Ford is built for performance-
toted performance!

25, which now established the quality of
Parliamentary Labor for many years to
come.
He was not exactly a popular figure
during the South African War, especially
after Mafeking, when, tricked by a
question from Barton while in the full
flight of a peroration, he announced that,
“I believe from the bottom of my heart
that this is the most iniquitous, most
immoral war ever waged with any race;
I hope that England may be defeated.”
But he said afterwards that he had com-
mitted himself “farther than he intended.”
A Surpassing Eloquence
TTe beat the humorous Arthur Grimm,
in after years a wonderful raconteur
of Holmania, by only 80 votes at the
election of July, 1901, and then proceed-
ed to study for the Bar. Both the Bar
Council and the Law Institute opposed
his admission on the ground of his con-
viction in the “Daily Post” case. But he
was admitted, and in succeeding years
had some success in industrial cases for
unions that rarely paid his fees, and some
enjoyable bouts with High Court judges
on constitutional issues. Some of the
judges became very angry with him.
Politics went along the even tenor of
their way, Labor finding it ever harder
to blackmail legislation out of that wily
bird Joseph Carruthers and harder still
to get anything through the Legislative
Council.
But the growth of Holman’s political
stature continued satisfactorily. He was
the chosen deputy leader, and the cham-
pion of Labor in the great two-day debate
with the redoubtable George Reid during
the latter’s campaign against Socialism on
which he stumped the continent in 1906.
Holman was surpassingly eloquent and
George hadn’t the chance to be as witty
as usual, because Holman had taken the
precaution to arrange with the Lord
Mayor of Sydney, who presided, that
there should be no interjections inter-
jections being the breath of life to
George. On the whole, Holman had the
better of the argument.
A victorious conflict with John Norton,
which involved his resigning and trium-
phantly re-winning Cootamundra, in-
creased his stature. He became Deputy-
Leader when Labor-for the first time be-
came an official Opposition in 1907 and
a national figure when he locked horns
with W. M. Hughes, during and after
the 1909-10 Coal Strike, over Federal
powers.
From that point it was an easy drive
for the party to the Government benches
in 1910, in victory over the inept and
inexperienced Gregory Wade.
Wade was easy meat. Holman, in one
of his more bitter moods, described him
as having the “eloquence of a mopoke,
the honesty of good leather, and the
finesse of a green tomato.”
Holman had been the man of the mo-
ment at the great Interstate Labor Con-
ference of 1908, securing the limitation of
the lengths to which the platform would
go in conceding tariff control over wages
and conditions in manufacturing plants
and the limits of Federal interference in
domestic intrastate commerce.
Not the least politic thing that Holman
did was to restrain his feelings in the face
of a sudden public upsurge of Australian
nationalism which threatened State
rights, and watch while Hughes himself
destroyed the chances of his referenda
succeeding by overdoing things; later
HOLMAN
As Low saw him on another occasion.
watching him again, as with conscription
later, fail to take “no” for an answer and
so contribute towards the destruction of
the Fisher Government in 1913 by
pressing for revised powers akin to those
he had been firmly refused earlier.
The NSW State elections took place
in October, 1910, six months after the
debacle of the Deakin-Cook fusion party
had put Fisher and Hughes into power.
Holman himself was obviously out to
forestall any nationalising plans Com-
monwealth Labor might have, for he
put foward comprehensive promises that,
if elected, the NSW Labor Party would
nationalise iron and steel, monopolies,
harbor ferries and gasworks. None of
these, however, were nationalised.
In fact, some State bread and a dock-
yard and brickworks eventually repre-
sented the main contribution of his
ministries of a decade towards producing
the Socialist millennium.
Labor entered office with McGowen as
an ineffective Premier, Holman as his
Deputy-Premier.
When McGowen left for England to
attend the Coronation of King George
V, the Ministry (which all through was
in a constant state of flux through deaths
and resignations) must have rejoiced that
the honest fellow was not there to handle
the situation which arose when W. F.
Dunn and Horne (Liverpool Plains) re-
signed because they could not support a
Bill to rescind legislation which allowed
perpetual leaseholders of agricultural
homesteads to convert their tenure to
freehold.
Holman weathered it successfully in
one of the most brilliant pieces of par-
liamentary manoeuvre on record. Wade
moved a censure motion, but it was
obvious that if. he were sent for by the
Governor he must stipulate for a dis-
solution. Holman’s plain objective was
to delay a vote which would oust him
till after the by-elections a month ahead.
Leaving his party to delay a vote of
•censure by asking a long string of
questions, without notice, of the un-
suspecting Wade, he hurried to Sir Wil-
liam Cullen, the acting Governor, and
asked for prorogation of Parliament till
after the by-elections, to allow members
to campaign. It was naturally refused.
He then announced that the Ministry
would resign but remain in office till a
new Government said it could carry on.
He got the advice of B. R. Wise, KC,
and publicly made it clear that Cullen
could not give Wade a commission with
a right of dissolution of a Parliament
only eight months old when two by-
elections could settle the matter.
“Rogue, Vile Worm, Pariah Dog ...”
"VText he pulled the Labor Speaker (J.
' H. Cann) out of the Chair to give
himself a majority of one and, catching
Wade napping again, installed the notor-
ious Henry Willis during an “all-
nighter” in which Willis was assailed
by the Opposition with every term of
abuse that fertile minds could encompass
. . . “rogue . . . vile worm . . . pariah
dog . . . skunk.” The Clerk in the Chair
had no power of discipline. Willis’ term
as Speaker was a wild and riotous affair.
The Conversion Bill was now with-
drawn, allowing Dunn to win Mudgee
as official Labor candidate. Ashford’s
election in Liverpool Plains showed him
in by a margin of three, but a recount
showed him out. On a second try he
won. All was well.
After McGowen came home in Sep-
tember, 1911, it took 20 months to dis-
place him for Holman. The latter, at the
end of 1912, applied to be sent to Lon-
don on a financial mission to see if he
could stand the climate. If he could,
he was to return and be appointed
Agent-General. But a crisis over the

sudden resignation from the Ministry
of Beeby he objected to having been
banned from criticising Hughes’ refer-
enda proposals and of Nielsen, the
Lands Minister, who was studying wheat
handling in America, scotched the
scheme. It was rumored very plainly
that Holman’s real objective was to sur-
vey the prospects of a seat in the Com-
mons.
Hugh D. Mclntosh Lends a Hand
He went in any case, financed by a
“loan” from Hugh D. Mclntosh,
erstwhile promoter of the Burns-Johnson
fight and theatrical entrepreneur. From
then onward an unhealthy odor of Mc-
Intosh and his myrmidons hung about
him. His negotiations were carried out
by Mclntosh and the latter’s Man Friday,
P. T. Taylor. If somebody accused Hol-
man or one of his ministers of corrup-
tion, Mclntosh or Taylor was sure to
be mentioned. When Premier, during
the war, Holman even made a holiday
voyage to Fiji with one of Mclntosh's
comedy companies. Wicked rumor de-
clared that not only the fare of Jack
Cannot, the comedian, was paid by
Mclntosh.
While in England Holman made
friends with many figures in the House
of Commons, particularly with Lord
Haldane. He seems to have had one de-
feat. While he was Acting Premier the
lease- to the Federal Government of
Sydney Government House, for use of
the Governor-General, fell in and Hol-
man had insisted that it should be turned
into an annexe to the Public Library. He
turned the old Greenway-built Govern-
ment House stables into the Conserva-
torium, thus laying the foundations of
the modern musical eminence of NSW.
In England he discussed the whole mat-
ter with King George V. From the fact
that Government House is still occupied
by State Governors it can be taken that
for once somebody won an argument
against Holman.
Holman became Premier on June 29,
1913. Willis was pushed unceremoni-
ously out of the Speakership and H. D.
Morton put in. A short session devoted
to window-dressing, and marred by
the first cries of scandal and corrup-
tion over wheat and public works
finance, ended, after a Royal Commis-
sion, in what the judge called “an
empty fiasco.” Then, having proved his
good intentions and- the brutal wicked-
ness of <the Legislative Council which
thwarted him wholesale, the new Prem-
ier won the election on December 6,
50 to 40, though only after a second bal-
lot in a number of seats. He did not take
the obvious step of using his mandate
to get the Council swamped into in-
ability to interfere with him while he
turned the Socialist vision splendid into
reality. There were dragons in his path
in the form of the Political Labor
League Executive which, at the instance
of its virtuous president (and new
Speaker), R. D. Meagher, decreed that
all prospective “honorables” should be
chosen by Caucus and approved by
itself.
This was awkward because of Hol-
man’s promise to include Hugh D. Mc-
Intosh in the first batch, Mclntosh being
the antithesis of everything that the Cau-
cus and the PLL would approve.
When wai had broken out and the
Fisher Government had ousted Joe
Cook from office and begun to assume
the major role of champion of Labor,
the new Premier must have been glad
of the uneasy party truce which he made
with Wade; for he was soon very un-
popular with the PLL leaders, since
he was open in saying that workers
might have to sacrifice some of their
standards in war time. He organised
a recruiting campaign and annoyed Irish
voters with his “patriotism.” He hob-
nobbed with the Universal Service
League, which openly advocated con-
scription, and declared publicly that
while he was against it in peacetime, the
Federal Government was the judge of
whether it was necessary in war time;
and if it thought the war could not
be won without it he would support it.
He was soon in trouble through
plumping for the retention of 11 o’clock
closing of hotels against 9 o’clock,
and got himself into a mess by announ-
cing a referendum which was defeated
two to one, only to be rescued when
the Federal Government used the War
Precautions Act to make the closing
hour six o’clock.
He was in continual strife with the
Party and unions because of unemploy-
ment problems and rising prices. He re-
fused to flood the Council with eager
statesmen from the unions, even though
that malign body continued to throw out
or tear to rags every piece of legislation
that contained “even the shadow of
justice for trade unionists” and was (if
that were possible) becoming “increas-
ingly impudent in its rejection of demo-
cratic measures.”
This created a crisis at the Easter
conference of the PLL in April, 1916.
But in his manoeuvres and threats of
resignation and an election soon brought
the Conference to heel.
Then arose a virtuous Scot in the
Assembly to commit political hara-kiri
by resigning as a protest against the
conference daring to intimidate Min-
isters of the Crown, but Holman went
on resigning and saw the grinning Cau-
cus elect John Storey in his place (much
to the latter’s embarrassment). And this
brought general tucking in of industrial-
ist tails until, the conference solaced,
with the promise of a referendum on the
abolition of the Upper House at the
election, the white flag went up over the
Trades Hall. The Bulletin was able
to publish a cartoon of the Premier’s
office cat asking Holman: “How do
you do it? I have only nine lives!”
By this time the name of the Govern-
ment was being dragged through the
mire almost every day. There were alle-
gations about scandals concerned with
wheat, liquor, bookmakers, petrol, finan-
cing of public works by the Norton-
Griffiths group and especially about
Hugh D. Mclntosh, who was all the
less popular in democratic circles be-
cause of the frightening company he had
been ostentatiously keeping while Hol-
man was bringing the PLL conference
to heel. There was a scandal about
employment of Germans in the Civil
Service, and Holman had to prove by
legal action that he was not by right of
birth Herr Hollmann and that his wife
hadn’t dipped her fingers into the Aus-
tralia Day Fund.
Hughes and Conscription
were Royal Commissions, abor-
A tive without being conclusive, and
legal actions that ended hurriedly in
vague apologies and withdrawals without
being pressed to jury hearings. The name
of Grahame, the Minister for Agriculture,
was smeared and he went out of office
in the end, and the names of Arthur
Griffith, another Minister, and Mclntosh
and Taylor popped up all too frequently.
Finally, while the industrial wing of
Labor was pledging itself to oppose con-
scription to the last bullet and the Irish
vote was screaming for the blood of
Hughes, Holman ranged himself behind
Hughes in the first conscription refer-
endum campaign.
With the referendum defeated both in
Australia and in NSW, it was certain
that his opponents would be out for
the blood of the only responsible State
Labor leader who had stood behind
Hughes. So, with the help of Wade and
his Liberals, he succeeded in putting off
the election from December, 1916, to
March 29, 1917, when, after negotia-
tions (through Mclntosh), he was able to '
agree with Wade and his followers to
form a “sacred union of all the best
elements in politics” and prolong the
life of Parliament until March 29, 1917.
The election was won with 50 National-
ist seats to Labor’s 33, thanks to the
superb organising quality of Archdale
Parkhill and the persuasive eloquence
of Holman himself.
And now there was no hesitation
about swamping the recalcitrant Upper
House. His first appointees were Hugh
D. Mclntosh and his henchman P. T.

layior among a swarm ol 23 servile if
honorable voting machines. In view of
the nature of his programme the ac-
cretion was scarcely needed.
The Parliament faced a turbulent
time. Holman went off to England and
the war front, leaving George Fuller in
charge to bear the burden of the near-
revolutionary railway and general strike
of 1917. He was lionised in London,
but in France he was knocked down
by the blast of a shell that killed Gen-
eral Holmes, who was talking to him at
the time. He suffered nervous reactions
from the accident for long afterwards.
He returned not quite the same Hol-
man he had been before. His rhetoric
was less limpid and persuasive, his touch
less sure, his magnetism not so compel-
ling, his air less gay. The retinue that
hung about him became a little more
questionable.
The poll of March 20, 1920, proved
how wrong was his prediction that Labor
would not recover from its last election
defeat for 15 years. Having been Pre-
mier for seven years, the longest term of
office in NSW history, he led his party
to a debacle. He himself was hopelessly
beaten in the now plural electorate of
Cootamundra by two Labor men and
two Progressive Country Party men.
He sang his swan song at a banquet to
Field-Marshal Lord Birdwood, over
which he presided just before he retired
from office: “I have lost my political
situation . . . my voice . . . my charac-
ter; all I have left to me is a little loose
change jingling ironically in my pocket”.
He had been in Parliament 21 years, 11
years continuously in ministries, and he
was 50 years old.
He returned to the Bar and did rea-
sonably well, particularly as counsel
assisting Sir George Fuller’s New States
Commission. For a period he was chair-
man of Mclntosh's “Sunday Times”. But
his health and his grip on life failed pro-
gressively. By the time he decided to
stand for the Federal Martin seat in suc-
cession to H. E. Pratten after the Scullin
debacle at the end of 1931, it was hard
to imagine that the tired, lined face, the
weary eyes, the husky voice and the
bowed shoulders formed the shell that
had housed the mind of one of the
most brightly sparkling and amusing of
companions, one of the three platform
speakers and political strategists of the
current century who rank pre-eminent in
lucidity and in magnetic power with par-
ties, audiences and Parliament alike. He
had no peers in his time save Deakin. He
died on June 4, 1934, after a visit to
Noumea, knowing that his return to
politics had been a sad fiasco, that his
reorganised seat was in danger at the
forthcoming election; that the future held
for him only pain and illness and growing
penury.

AUSTRALIA AND MALAYSIA
Sir,
Despite the fact that “secret” or “pri-
vate” treaties were discarded by Com-
monwealth countries after World War I,
the ALP persists in demanding an “open”
or “public” treaty of mutual assistance
between Australia and Malaysia. The
latter adjectives are presumably used for
their popular appeal, but the idea of
such a treaty is probably a delaying de-
vice to cover up differences of opinion
between the ALP’s Right and Left wings.
By contrast, the recent unilateral pledge
of the Australian Government to use
force, if necessary, to protect Malaysia
bears some comparison with Britain’s
unilateral guarantee, prior to World War
I, of the neutrality of Belgium. The
needs of sea-power dictated Britain’s
policy of not allowing the Low Coun-
tries to be occupied by an unfriendly
power. The British Liberal Government
of 1914 had its Right-wing elements,
personified in Winston Churchill, and its
“radicals” led by Lloyd George. At an
historical Cabinet meeting both Lloyd
George and Lord Morley opposed Brit-
ain’s intervention. Morley resigned but
Lloyd George did a quick about-face
and harmony was restored.
This is not the time to quibble about
the form which a defence agreement with
Malaysia takes. It is of paramount con-
cern to Australia that the political and
territorial integrity of Malaysia should
be preserved in the same way that the
integrity of Belgium was of vital import-
ance to Britain in 1914.

“BASE JIBE”
Sir,
As British and Gurkha soldiers are
dying in Sabai (Borneo) in defence of
Australia just as much as of Malaysia,
a defence effort to the tune of 10,000
troops in Sabai alone, I denounce your
cheap, crude and tasteless Tanner car-
toon jibe (2/11/63) at Britain’s Lord
Home and, by inference, at the British
aircraft industry, too. This is viciously
biassed and unfair.
Australians don’t pay a penny for this
British defence effort in this area. Aus-
tralia must stop alienating and rubbish-
ing Britain in this despicable, base,
insulting and ungrateful way. There is
too much at stake, with Red China
looming ominously over everything, for
us to afford the luxury of turning on
Britain and insulting her.
R. BARKER
Sydney (NSW).
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
Sir,
Regarding your letter from Norman
Fisher (28/9/63) about racial dis-
crimination in Papua/New Guinea, we
in Fiji also suffer this kind of thing
continually. People come here, spend
from a day to a week, then go away to
write books and give newspaper inter-
views expounding views that haven’t the
faintest connection with reality. Mr
Fisher and his student body make the
age-old mistake of attributing every sign
of discrimination on the part of the
European to the color of the skin. Such
factors as a primitive stage of what we
call “civilisation”, with which go auto-
matically such things as ignorance of
hygiene and the untrained brain, are
quite overlooked.
The New Guineans, like the Fijians
and Indians here, can be the best of
friends with Europeans; each can
admire certain qualities in the other, but
prefer to drink and play among their
own kind without any insult being
assumed or intended.
We have here distinguished and
educated Fijians who are the equal of
any race and who have the privileges
such eminence commands, which in-
cludes sincere friendship with other
races.
That day will come to New Guineans
with time, but the color of the skin will
be the same.
T. F. FRENCH
Suva (Fiji).
Sir,
I read with interest the letter from
Norman Fisher. He states that “New
Guineans are still excluded from hotel
lounges and from most of the clubs”. For
Mr Fisher's information, any person of
any race can enter a hotel lounge pro-
vided he is suitably attired, the require-
ments being shoes, socks, shirt and shorts.
Nobody is permitted to enter that part of
a hotel in just a lap-lap in the case of an
indigenous person, or an expatriate wear-
ing shorts only. Regarding clubs, a person
must be a financial member, irrespective
of race or color.
Mr Fisher next attacks a major pri-
vate airline. I am in doubt as to the
accuracy of his statements, as all races
are extended the same courtesy in the
terminal building and by the stewards
and hostesses in the air. Regarding his
remarks on inter-island ships, there are
no ferry services or passenger vessels
running in the Territory. They are all
cargo vessels and these ships must run
to cargo capacity; any person travelling
on them must be prepared to tolerate
the makeshift conditions.
There is only social discrimination
here in the Territory and it applies no
more here than any part of the world.

Plain English (“Picking Up the Pieces”,

seizure of the Canal would destroy him

Nothing of the sort happened, and Nas-

Although it is history now, and al-

I wish, respectfully, to bring the follow-

(i) The Canal was not seized, but,
as an Egyptian limited liability com-

(ii) The action was 100 per cent legal.
This was proved by our Government

(iii) Egypt gets loans and credit facili-
ties from Russia, USA, Britain, Japan,
Germany and other countries. The

SYDNEY COVE
Sir,
I do not think that the reason adduced
by Mrs Margaret Roe (2/11/63) for the
failure of the academic world to pounce
on me in a body because an article of
mine stated that the first landing in
Sydney Cove took place on January 25
instead of January 26, 1788, was due
to the fact that my “methods of argu-
ment have silenced potential critics,”
though I am flattered by her inference.
I should imagine that nobody bothered
about it because (a) it must have been
generally appreciated that any mistake
of the sort by a man who has given
dozens of Anniversary Day addresses
and written dozens more Anniversary
articles could only be due to a misprint
or an accidental mis-typing; (b) that,
using the naval calendar, January 25 is
equally as correct as January 26. The
naval day beginning at noon, when “the
sun was taken”, it was still January 25
on the nautical day when Phillip landed.
The only useful reason for this letter
under the circumstances is to point out
that there is a good deal of confusion
about dating in the records of our first
few days of history because ships’ logs
in the First Fleet use naval time, and
their dating is a day off the conventional
dates.

UPSIDE DOWN
Sir,
I was rather surprised, when reading
your excellent article on Lee Kuan Yew
(19/10/63), to notice both on pages 17
and 20 that the emblem of the People’s
Action Party has been printed upside
down.

FOUNDATION GARMENTS
Sir,
I was concerned to read that I had
been reported incorrectly and out of
context in the article on the foundation
garment industry (26/10/63). I was
reported to have said: “The Formfit
people are not greatly concerned with
fittings, measurements and statistics. We
are in this business simply to make
money.”
What I did say was, in answer to a
question as to whether our company was
as much concerned with the multitude
of fittings and extensive measurements
and charts and statistical background as
another company, that we were not as
concerned with these items as we were
with being in the fashion foundation
garment business, which did not require
as much dependency upon such a wide
range of fittings, measurement charts
and statistics. I also mentioned that
apart from being in the business to
make top fashion foundation garments
at reasonable prices, we were also very
concerned at producing good profits. I
feel that the method in which these two
answers were reported rather gave the
incorrect impression that our company
was only interested in making money
and had no concern for the quality of
merchandise, which is far from correct.

REVIEWS
THEATRE
Debasing the Classics
Moliere goes through the mill
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
The Happy Invalid. Adapted from
Le Malade Imaginaire. Moliere.
Union Theatre Repertory Com-
pany. Union Theatre. Melbourne.
The Bastard Country. Anthony
Coburn. Studio Theatre Group.
Arrow Theatre. Melbourne.
HThis production gives us Moliere re-
A written as a vehicle for Frank
Thring, Moliere vulgarised and pre-
sented with a nudge and a wink. At one
time in England, when the theatre was
in the doldrums, it was considered
essential to adapt Shakespeare for the
stage. Shaw described this as “a process
which no doubt presents itself to the
adapter’s mind as one of masterly
amelioration, but which must neces-
sarily be mainly one of debasement and
mutilation whenever, as occasionally
happens, the adapter is inferior to the
author.”
What can have possessed Wal Cherry,
the producer, to subject Moliere to such
treatment? Irritation with General de
Gaulle? Or has it got something to do
with the fact that earlier in the year
Frank Thring was a box-office success
as a modern invalid in “The Man W’ho
Came To Dinner”? This production is
advertised in the newspapers simply as
Frank Thring as “The Happy Invalid”.
There is no mention of the author.
Mr Thring is a personality in his own
right and very often he simply plays
himself, as he does in “The Happy
Invalid.” Sometimes he submits himself
to the discipline of the dramatist’s in-
tentions and gives an excellent per-
formance, as he did in Wal Cherry’s
production of “Rhinoceros”, by lonesco.
But Mr Thring can hardly be blamed
when the Union Repertory Company
deliberately sets out to exploit his per-
sonality as a box-office attraction, and
to exploit Moliere as a vehicle for Frank
Thring.
As everyone knows, the classics do
not pay and consequently are rarely
seen in the commercial theatres. In
order to have theatres in which the
classics and serious new plays are per-
formed by professional actors, it is
necessary to provide subsidies. The
Union Theatre Repertory Company is
subsidised by the University of Mel-
bourne in association with the Aus-
tralian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. John
Sumner, the administrator, has built up
a strong company with high standards of
production and design. But unless this
company devotes itself to faithful
presentation of serious drama, the whole
point of its existence is lost.
Unfortunately, the practice of the
Union Repertory Company reveals a
state of uneasy compromise. When it
presents a classical play it feels an
irresistible urge to “liven it up,” to add
a little sugar and water, to play for the
easy laugh. This policy of “masterly
amelioration” makes the worst of all
worlds. The kind of audience that
wants to see the classics will be re-
pelled by such productions, and the
kind of audience that wants merely to be
diverted will probably be happier at a
musical, which the commercial theatres
can provide without benefit of subsidy.
This unhappy hybrid has very hand-
some sets and costumes by Ann Fraser.
It is a restless production with the cast
ceaselessly fluttering about like moths on
a warm night. Anything, it seems, to
distract attention from the dialogue.
Some of the women’s performances show
a better feeling for the period than the
men’s. Joan Harris as Toinette, Patsy
King as Beline and Frances McDonald
as Louise would be quite at home in
“Le Malade Imaginaire” if they stopped
fluttering.
Wal Cherry does not attempt the
comedy ballets except in the final scene
in which Argan is inducted into the
medical profession. This is the liveliest
scene in the production.
“The Bastard Country” is the usual
melodrama posing as “harsh realism”
which represents so many Australian
dramatists’ idea of life in the bush. One
can only assume that they have never
ventured beyond the outer suburbs.
John Willy, who has murdered an-
other man’s wife as well as his own,
is apparently not responsible for his
actions, and therefore not a fit subject
for drama. The audience, trying to see
the pattern as the events of the play
unfold, only gradually realises that this
man is mad, and the whole play con-
sequently a tissue of nonsense.
John Gauci gave \ a convincing per-
formance as Nick Diargos, the Greek.
The performances of most of the cast
were hopelessly marred by execrable
speaking. Whether this was due to
native inability, or to a fixed conviction
in the minds of actors or producers that
outback Australians are a lot of
mumbling hillbillies, was impossible to
tell.
FILMS
Devilry
The Devil and the Ten Command-
ments. Director, Julien Duvivier.
Savoy, Sydney.
The Condemned of Altona. Director,
Vittorio de Sica. Palace., Sydney.
tpHE light-hearted cynicism of Julien
Duvivier’s “The Devil and the Ten
Commandments”, allied to the director’s
unerring expertise, makes this long film
constantly diverting. It isn’t an import-
ant landmark in the cinema; though it
deals with good and evil it doesn’t even
try to say anything profound about them,
merely treating them with a Gallic
frivolity that is uncommonly entertain-
ing.
Above all, it is the film of a real
“pro”, a director who knows his
medium intimately, who sets out to
amuse and does it with style and grace.
The story starts in a convent, where
the elderly handyman’s habit of swear-
ing worries the humorless Mother
Superior. A visiting, bishop suggests
that the handyman should be made to
learn the Ten Commandments by heart
(in particular the one about not taking
the name of the Lord in vain) as a
penance. After this Duvivier presents a
number of episodes illustrating the Com-
mandments, loosely linked by a com-
mentary spoken by the Devil in the
guise of a serpent.
The neatly scripted film ranges in
style from the cool, sophisticated comedy
of the episode involving Francoise
Arnoul, Micheline Presle, Claude
Dauphin and a diamond necklace to the
knockabout farce of the delightful bank
robbery sequence featuring Jean-Claude
Brialy.
Vittorio de Sica’s “The Condemned
of Altona”, on the other hand, is deadly

serious—and mostly, I’m afraid, deadly
dull. It is an enormously well-intentioned
film, but where it means to be hard-
hitting it is ponderous, didactic and
stuffy.
A German industrialist dying of
cancer summons his younger son and
his rebellious wife to the family estate.
The wife, who disapproves of her
father -in - law’s policy of supporting
whatever regime is in power, discovers
that his elder son, supposedly dead, is
actually a madman kept hidden in an
attic room, where he seeks to expiate his
feelings of guilt for Germany in general
and in particular for his own crimes in
the Russian campaign. The woman’s
attempts to bring this man back to the
world result in tragedy.
The film is based on a Sartre play
which was powerful since a discussion
of moral attitudes can have great
dramatic force on the stage. But in the
screen medium the characters’ habit of
speechifying soon becomes tiresome.
To make matters worse, the film is
weighed down with Abby Mann’s
hortatory, hectoring script which sounds
like a pamphlet called “What’s Wrong
With Germany”, and Vittorio de Sica’s
snail-paced direction.
No actors could bring to life the un-
real characters of the film, so Fredric
March, Maximilian Schell and Fran-
coise Prevost have settled for a sort of
hysterical bravura that is strikingly
competent though never credible. Sophia
Loren and Robert Wagner look hand-
some but dazed.

In the premiere, Miss Desmond sang

have seen all of them all of the time.
If the camera crews needed some
exercise, the group called The Squires
would have been a more suitable object
for it, but they were presented without
ingenuity. The show had an outdoor

apparently singing her way around The

of bystanders but not of this viewer.

ART
Diversity
Erica McGilchrist. Argus Gallery.
Melbourne.
HPhe three years which Erica McGil-
christ has recently spent in Ger-
many have produced a lot of very good
painting. One of its striking qualities
is its diversity of interest and theme,
which goes a long way towards making
the large exhibition an interesting one.
Not that she changes style a great deal,
but she does present her thought in a
variety of moods, all of them equally
attractive. One of the series four
collages —is satirical; another political
(if being against war is political); whilst
a group of twelve “profiles” might be
safely called poetic in intent. The groups,
are generally figurative, the other half
of the exhibition mainly abstract.
Being able to handle such a diverse
range of theme convincingly is in itself
an indication of Erica McGilchrist’s com-
mand over her art. All the work is in-
formed by a clear intelligence and an
accomplished use of materials. It is
strong, controlled work, which makes
no bones about being explicit, but which
at the same time moves confidently
among poetic allusions. Miss McGil-
christ herself explains that her paintings
“are concerned with the translation into
visual terms of the essentially invisible
universe of man’s innermost nature”.
Without going too far into the somewhat
contradictory aesthetics which this
implies, we must grant that with this
exhibition she has demonstrated that
both moods and ideas can be given quite
clear visual equivalents which strike
common responses without having to
descend to the lowest common. She is
not afraid to start with ideas, and as a
result she can use her art to express
them. Provided the art is sound, I’ve
always found that a more rewarding way
of going about things.

The Triumph of Eros
Norman Lindsay’s impudent genius
By CHARLES HIGHAM
The Cautious Amorist. Norman Lind-
say. Horwitz. ss. 6d.
VTorman Lindsay’s novels—spanning
most of his mature lifetime between
1913 and 1950—are rarely discussed
nowadays: it's hard for a new generation
of writers here to grasp the overpowering
impact he had on several Australian
poets, or to know how great his popu-
larity was in the United States during
and after the Depression years (a full
account of his brief but brilliant period
in New York more than 30 years ago,
during which he mingled with the cele-
brated literary set of the day, has never
been properly chronicled). To most con-
temporary artists, one assumes his name
is a dirty word; strenuous attempts to
place him among the masters, most
notably in an issue of “Southerly” not
so long ago, have failed, and this rare
attempt on the part of Australian intel-
lectuals to elevate one of their number
to the halls of immortality has met with
little interest from the opinion-makers
of the last decade. Lindsay, aloof at
Springwood, an octogenarian virtually
silent for 10 years, seems to be regarded
as a curio, a figure from the past about
whom little more can be said.
He is not, I think, a major writer, but
rather an engaging minor one, a petit
maitre who has not been properly assess-
ed. One of the indications of his mastery
has been his clinging to a constant vision,
and his warm and vibrant understanding
of his native country. His ear for dialogue
remains unrivalled in our literature, cap-
turing the exact cadences of Australian
speech with affectionate precision; his
evocation of bush and coast is admirable,
especially in the under-rated “The Cou-
sin from Fiji” and in “Miracles by
Arrangement,” and he has understood
what it means to be young, vigorous,
frustrated, and Australian, as well as any-
body in our time. In book after book, the
theme is identical: the conflict between
youth and age, between that thrusting life
which is fed by the native sun and stimu-
lated by the Australian diet and the rig-
orous Puritanism which we have imposed
on that life; between tough, unspoilt
small boys and ear-smacking bluenose
parents; between adolescents discovering
sex and parsons trying to deny its exis-
tence. The humor is spry, coarse and
vivid, the writing homespun and yet intri-
cate and clever, the philosophy one of
permissive vitalism, honoring youth and
health and passion above coolth and calm
and wisdom. Astonishingly, Lindsay has
managed to retain his convictions, his
style, his cast of characters into the
middle of the twentieth century; his spirit
is obviously unquenchable, and one can
honor him for that. Although I think the
claims that he is an Olympian giant are
absurd, he is already part of our history.
best characters are his young
men and small boys: Robert Piper
in “Redheap,” restless, virile, looking for
love; Jerry Gresham and Peter Tregear
in “Miracles by Arrangement,” Ted Tar-
ran in “Pan in the Parlor,” all the kids in
“Saturdee” —these are completely felt
creations, alive and tangible. His finest
books are those in which the background
is realised with the greatest intensity:
“Redheap” with its brilliant evocation of
a small town simmering in the summer
heat; “Miracles by Arrangement,” full of
beach scents and sounds; “Saturdee’s”
mine-diggings and wild country; “The
Cousin From Fiji’s” wonderfully realised
Ballarat, like a town (but more intensely
realised) out of Booth Tarkington. I
agree that at his best Lindsay is the equal
of Twain, although Twain’s poetry, his
sense of the magic of the wild, are missing
and there is a strange streak of bitterness,
of anger and disappointment in Lindsay
that occasionally turn the stream of cheer-
ful narrative sour. Sometimes the realism
catches you by the throat, as in Robert’s
stumbling first attempt at love in “Red-
heap,” instantly recognisable and true;
sometimes, the writing loses touch with
life, as in “Madam Life’s Lovers,” an
almost Ninetyish example of Lindsay’s
less happy “artificial” style. And the crud-
ity, especially in “Dust or Polish” and
parts of “A Curate in Bohemia,” his
last and first novels, can be depressing.
“The Cautious Amorist,” recently re-
printed by Horwitz, is an example of
Lindsay’s permanent assertion: Eros will
always triumph. Although one of Lind-
say’s less important works, it is intensely
personal and illustrative of his philo-
sophy—a spry entertainment with deeply
serious undertones.
The story opens on the SS “Minorca,”
three days out from Honolulu: a blown
fuse plunges the vessel in darkness and a
cloudburst passes by; another ship crashes
into the “Minorca” during the subse-
quent confusion, ripping open her after
hatchway. A journalist, James Carrol, the
Rev. Fletcher Gibble, and a ship’s stoker,
Patrick Plunket, escape into a lifeboat
with a beautiful girl, Sadie Patch. After
drifting for three days the castaways
come to an island which has satirical re-
semblances to H. de Vere Stacpoole’s in
“The Blue Lagoon.” From the first,
Lindsay dwells on the charms of his
heroine: “Like the others she was
stretched flat on her back, and the night
damp had moulded her skimpy frock to
the pattern of her rounded legs and the
strong arch of her back supporting two
undaunted breasts.” Another even more
characteristic passage follows as Carrol
looks enviously at Patrick Plunket: “Car-
rol stared morosely at the brawny figure
with the pipe clenched in its teeth; a
creature immune from discomfort and
fatigue. His muscles padded him
buoyantly up from the floorboards, the
rise and fall of a splendid chest pumped

energy into a mechanism at ease with
life. In Carrol’s glance at him was the
envy of an intellectual who sees the
finest bodies squandered on the crude
denizens of the earth.”
Reaching the island, Carrol and the
Rev. Gibble fall into an argument.
Gibble is complacent: “Here we are,
safe, provided with food, fire, a er
splendid climate. We must acknowledge
a guiding hand here; a hand of vast
benevolence.” Carrol heartily disagrees:
“The system by which we experience
(life) . . . that’s a stinking, mean, lousy
process of frustration and nothing else.
Oh, I know we cling like blazes all the
same. Apply Sam Johnson’s test of
clapping a pistol to my head and I’ll
yell for help. But that’s the tick that
keeps us going with all the foolery. Funk,
pure funk.”
The brute optimist and the brainy
pessimist have a characteristic, further
exchange: “‘Am I not the grandest
figure of a man you ever looked at?’
(Paddy) said with honorable candor.
“ ‘You are. I’d give the thing I call
my intelligence for your body any day.’
“ ‘You’d have the best of the bargain.
What is brains good for but to torment
the guts out of yourself?’ ”
As the book continues, the island
becomes a microcosm, and the people
symbols: Sadie is Passive Physical,
Patrick is Active Physical, Carrol is
intellect and Gibble is—or rather thinks
he is—the soul. Sadie, of course, remains
in danger from brawn, brains and spirit.
Carrol, enjoying the simple life of sun
and sand, improves physically and begins
to feel the twinges of desire. Sadie
finally has to take the upper hand,
seducing him in a typhoon while outside
their cave “a shrieking barrier of wind
sealed them against a world gone mad
with the turmoil of riven clouds and
driven seas, streaming away into the
night its hoot of derision for a rational
earth . .
Gibble experiences lust for Sadie in
terms suitable for a health testimonial,
c. 1932 vintage: “Light beat up from
the sand and made marvellous tints of
her skin, as if light from within glowed
through it. Its essence permeated her in
a radiation of health, as sweetly scented
as the fruits that had replaced a crude
dynamic once extracted from the dead
bodies of animals. They had all benefited
by a fish and fruit diet in its return of a
clarified blood system.” After speeches
like “I cannot believe I hold you in my
arms, yet, strange, I seem to have been
waiting all my life for this moment, as if
it was ordained,” Gibble finally takes
possession in Chapter 18.
Finally, after a boat is sighted and a
fire lit, the foursome is rescued —once
aboard the rescue vessel “Acanora”,
Sadie, of course, makes a beeline for the
Captain.

This coarse, funny, absurd book ought
to be rubbish, and it was turned into
just that in a film version, “Our Girl
Friday.” Yet, mysteriously, the whole
thing works: if this isn’t literature, then
at least it’s an engaging sport. The humor
is impish throughout: the most virile
member of the cast —the muscle-flexing
Pat —is the slowest where the girl is con-
cerned, the love passages are deliberate
mockeries of romantic fiction, the island
is excellently conveyed. Gibble is drawn
with great wit and sparkle, especially in
the scenes with Sadie; Carrol's discovery
of the body is affectionately done; Pat’s
reminiscences of the past are entertain-
ing; Sadie Patch is a fine parody. Yet the
purpose of the book is clearly not solely
that of entertainment: Lindsay obviously
sees that the island is providing a means
for each of the characters of discovering
a new lease of life: that the effect of a
purely physical experience can pare
people down to what they are. The tone
of the novel is sensuous and permissive,
written in the teeth of a wowserish Aus-
tralia which Lindsay had left shortly be-
fore because of the banning of “Red-
heap.” Carrol discovers his manhood by
going naked, by feeling the sun and the
salt water on his body; Gibble finds his
true identity when he loses his inhibitions;
Pat, already a man, correctly sees the
need for change in his fellows and re-
joices when it comes; Sadie is the earth
mother to whom all turn.
The structure of “The Cautious
Amorist” shows Lindsay’s growing
maturity as a technician: the quartet is
admirably disposed and rearranged on
the desert island stage; the management
suggests a practised playwright’s skill.
Lindsay had prepared the ground for his
masterwork, “Saturdee,” and the other
major books, among them “The Cousin
From Fiji" and “Halfway to Anywhere,”
which followed.

Old Aussies should be grate-
ful when a Hungarian migrant of
only about 10 years’ standing has master-
ed so much English she can write a book
about herself and call it “Impudent
Foreigner”, so it seems almost ungraci-
ous to wish that she had mastered much
less, or to conclude that what anyone
acquires easiest in a foreign language is
a set of kitsch cliches, e.g.: “I am put-
ting a woman’s beating heart, unashamed,
into the reader’s hand.”
Mrs Kunrathy’s heart was first ready
to beat as a New Moroccan's, a New
Argentinian’s and a New Brazilian’s, but
the applications were rejected, so it now
beats as a New Australian’s. After the
conclusion of World War 11, the Ger-
mans, with whose army her husband had
been fighting as a volunteer officer and
who had been decorated for valor and
even evacuated with his family from
Hungary into Germany, showed no grati-
tude, only distinct signs of trying to get
rid of them. “Impudent Foreigner”
were the Germans’ words for them, not
ours. Also, unaccountably, Mrs Kun-
rathy’s first husband decided he wanted
to divorce her (she had then not even
written this book). First husband plus
new wife and second husband plus
authoress migrated together.
Somehow, the story of her tribulations
in Germany during Allied air-raids, the
exploitation of the populace by the oc-
cupying Yanks (cigarettes for a mink)
and the all-important question of whether
the Yanks believed that her husband be-
lieved that she had or had not slept with
the American major left me rather un-
moved. “Unashamed”, as promised, Mrs
Kunrathy relates her own and her
friends’ blackmarket activities in post-war
Germany, her little attempted bribe of
Her Majesty’s Australian Customs on
landing and even includes pianist
D’Albert-Carenno’s bewhiskered old joke
(your children and my children are quar-
relling with our children) as if it were
original.
Any resemblance between her descrip-
tion of how to be a good salesman and
sell washing-machines on flattery—she
has a- shop—and the implied compli-
ments of her aggressive new Australian-
ism that ooze out of the page is, no
doubt, purely coincidental.
We could do with a book from the
viewpoint of a New Australian but it
would have to contain less “my” and
more “migrant” and its author should,
preferably, emerge as sympaiisch.
The headmaster of “Hopeton High,”
Mr Mullet, normally a somnolent old fish
submerged fathoms down in a sea of un-
solved crossword puzzles, takes the 1 bait,
hook, line and microphone when those
sharks Mr Stringo and Mr Scroggie—
out of altruistic motives and not because
of any connection with the electrical firm
of Winter and Slide dangle before him
the prospect of putting his school of
small fry in the forefront by installing a
Warwick Peerless Public Address System.
Soon, from every classroom wall, the
voice of Big Brother Mullet is heard
competing divertingly for his pupils’ at-
tention with the unanticipated interjec-
tions of the new station 2XL.
Logically, there must follow a School

Fete to cover the expenses of progress
and to disrupt the routine, with the local
Member readily giving a lesson in how
to talk for one hour without saying
anything and where even Heaven’s
scholastic representative on earth, the
Director of Education, graciously honors
the occasion by sending a deputy. What
if the Warwick Peerless has already been
rendered as useless as the school’s previ-
ous electrical purchases! There is always
the prospect of buying the Cystax Wave
Trap to add to the collection with the
hope that it knows how to catch the
waves of 2XL. And, of course, a whole
cycle of fetes to pay for it all.
There is plenty of vivid life in Kathar-
ine Susannah Prichard’s history which
she relates in a straightforward, no non-
sense style from her Fijian birth in a
storm, through her career as country gov-
erness (frocking by Jane Eyre) to inter-
national journalist and social reformer
and, after winning the Hodder and
Stoughton competition, as famous novel-
ist. She breaks off suddenly, soon after
the suicide of her beloved VC hero hus-
band, giving few dates, but her record ap-
pears to end around the beginning of the
Second World War. There is inevitably
much name-dropping, George Meredith,
D. H. Lawrence, Shaw, Sarah Bernhardt,
Marchesi and many others against whom
her life brushed briefly. Her London of
old slums, poor men’s queues and pre-
emancipated women still looms frighten-
ingly real through the fog of time.
What emerges as Miss Prichard’s
strongest characteristic is her single-
mindedness. Her belief in her mission
and in herself appears to have been un-
shakable at all times, under all circum-
stances; and her courage and integrity
in following only what she felt to be
right must arouse admiration in any
reader. One cannot help wondering
how her ideas have withstood the years
between. Have all her political views,
for instance, remained completely un-
diluted? It would be interesting to
know.
From “The Lawless and the Lotus”,
an entertaining log-book of a raw un-
Cook-ed tour of some of the world’s
sunshiney isles from the Caribbean to
the Pacific, author Peter Pinney appears
as an engaging, rascally hobo, a sort of
combination of James Bond, Ned Kelly
and a lighter-fingered member of some
civic liberties group on the run. If he
doesn’t like the uncomplimentary entries
the unkind police of Martinique add to
his passport when deporting him, it seems
perfectly correct to erase them with the
appropriate ink. When he has insuffici-
ent money to travel even Fourth Class
on the “Tahitien” he stows away—and
gets away, too. Far from trying to re-
main inconspicuous, he assumes the
identity of various other passengers in
turn, picks a fight with a professional

trickster, pockets the scoundrel’s win-
nings himself and finances the remainder
of his journey back to Australia with
the proceeds.
When Peter Pinney finds the inmates
of a Zoo dying of thirst, hunger and
pure neglect, it is only logical to let the
more vegetarian animals and birds out
of their cages and write a letter to the
local paper admitting the deed. Next
time the carnivorous won’t be excluded!
He joins “moonshiners” in making illicit
rum at St Kitts, Marlon Brando in mak-
ing the “Bounty” less than perfect, girls
from the Virgin Islands to Tahiti in mak-
ing love, and nonconformists all over
the place in making the law a rollicking
joke. His off-beat descriptions of the
beauties (scenic) of his lotus islands are
splashed with primary colors, as boldly
free from guide-book jargon and travel-
ogue double-talk as his life is free of
anchors and humbug.
Ronald Morrieson’s macabre novel
“The Scarecrow” is meant to be funny
ha-ha and funny-peculiar. It is often
plain peculiar. A ghoulish sex-fiend on
the run messes around with a female
corpse in a disreputable small-town
morgue and murders the village simple-
ton because he looked, and murders a
schoolgirl to keep up the supply and is
about to murder the village’s 16-year-old
beauty when he is accidentally killed by
her tipsy brother who then unloads his
body on to the putrid garbage dump
which is alive with rats, so they can
all go back to living drunkenly ever
after. . .
To bring off grotesquerie like this you
need a new Wedekind or Edgar Allan
Poe or, for farce, an Andrew Sinclair.
At no time can any of it afford to be
mistaken for a rude youngster’s chalky
graffiti in search of a wall, an effect
somewhat underlined when the narrator
is a 15-year-old schoolboy. When Neddy
sticks to writing about his own scare-
crows—his old junk-dealing family, his
Freudian urges and the instructive extra-
curricular activities of his classmates, the
terrorist gang, the hen-stealing and his
sister’s love-affairs —the story breaks
lustily out of its moulding coffin and
bursts into exuberant life. If anything,
there was a surfeit of scarecrows in this
New Zealand town already.
Perhaps the author intended to cover
sex alphabetically in all its infinite
varieties from Adolescents to Zombies,
but for this his encyclopaedia is not all-
embracing enough. More likely it was
a case of “think of a first sentence” and
go on to shape a book to fit: “The same
week our fowls were stolen, Daphne
Moran had her throat cut”. It’s a pity
the sentences that follow rarely come up
to scratch. But with this beginning the
author sets himself a steep hurdle—and
slips through below it.

two most recent additions to “The
A Arts in Australia” bring the total
to eleven volumes. Robin Boyd’s “The
New Architecture” is one of the best. Mr
Boyd divides architecture since the
’fifties into vernacular (or Pop), profes-
sional and creative, the first dismally
bad, the second conservative and taste-
ful, the third “New” and worthy of
serious consideration. The leading char-
acteristics of the New Architecture are
structural simplicity, clarity and rarity.
It is found mostly in private homes,
occasionally in small commercial and
public buildings and sometimes, sur-
prisingly, in “frenzied enterprises such
as bowling alleys” (notably the Parra-
matta Bowl). In his very limited space,
Mr Boyd makes his points trenchantly
and illustrates them well.
In spite of its comparative rarity,
there is enough good architecture here
to warrant talk of a characteristically
Australian architecture. Commercial art,
in R. Haughton James’s view, is in a
much more parlous state. The same
businessmen who live in dull buildings
employ dull designers. There is no
excuse. The talent exists, Mr James
assures us, yet even though it is of mani-
fest commercial value, it is rarely put to
use.

Meredith and Mrs Baxter painting the
rude untutored Australia of the late
1830 s and 1840 s, are the mothers of
the kind of writing to which Mrs Clacy’s
book belongs. She is a worthy member
of the Female Society of Bush Pioneers,
a virginal young “pocket-sized” person
who, as if she were going to Broadstairs
for a fortnight, sets out with her public-
school brother who has “flung aside his
Homer and Euclid for the various guides
printed for the intending goldseeker,”
for the “auriferous regions” of Victoria
in the first flush of the gold rushes of
the early 1850 s. She describes, without
becoming excited, Melbourne, which was
more like a drunken riot than a town,
and Bendigo and Ballarat, which she
sees in company with her escort and his
youthful companions. In process of her
experiences, she suffered everything
woman could suffer in mud, rain, rocks
and potholes and among every kind of
inhabitant appropriate to Murderer’s
Flat, Chokem Gully, Peg Leg Gully and
Specimen Hill. And what was more, she
seems to have enjoyed every minute of
it. She found time to keep a diary in
which the most exciting events are
mentioned in the coolest prose. She kept
abreast of the bubblings of events around
her, learnt very accurately the vocabulary
of the fields and then voyaged back to
old England not only with enough mat-
erial for a book but actually with a little
bullion and an adequate husband.
Within three years of setting out from
England she seems to have been not only
a matron with a wealth of adventure
behind her but a successful authoress in
her second edition. Her little book could
provide the heart of a considerable novel
of the goldfields.
HThe second of the Heritage books does
not show Anthony Trollope at his
best. It looks like what it is: a hasty
pot-boiler dashed off in a month for the
Christmas number of the “Graphic” in
1873, after his visit to Australia a year
or two earlier. He makes use of all the
conventional props and characters com-
mon to the Australian adventure serial
of the time, e.g. the young squatter in
flannel and moleskins, 24 years old, who
is a “well known west of the Mary
River in Queensland . . . owned 30,000
sheep of his own, was a magistrate in
those parts and able to hold his own
with his neighbors rough or gentle.”
He is accounted “too imperious, too
masterful,” having “sprung at once into
patriarchal power.” And naturally when
such a man even if “a tall well-made
young fellow, with fair hair and a good
humored smile” gets mixed up with
the rough conditions of 120,000 acres
of domain in the wild Australian bush all
the natural emanations of such a situa-
tion are distilled. Love, conspiracy, bush-
fires and villains whom the bush
naturally swallows up at the behest of
Divine Justice, so that they “become as
desolate and savage as solitary animals
. . . creeping, we may suppose, into
hidden nooks as the beasts do when the
hour of death comes upon them.” The
hero, of course, is to be seen in his
hour of triumph, asleep (and, one hopes,
not snoring!) in the surilight. He was
dreaming, no doubt, of some happy
squatting land in which there w'ere no
free selectors, no fires, no rebellious
servants, no floods, no droughts, no wild
dogs to worry the lambs, no grass seeds,
and in which the wool stood at 2s. 6d.
a pound, while his wife from time to
time “protected him from the flies and
administered in her soft way to what
she thought might be his comforts.”
Miss Keesing’s “By Gravel And Gum”
is the fourth of a series of Great Stories
of Australia of which the opening volume
was Mary Durack’s “To Ride A Fine
Horse.” It is a biographical pioneering
romance of the “wild wayback” written
for young people and based on the story
of Sarah White, born at Burrangong,
hard by Lambing Flat (Young), in 1837
after her family had trekked down there
from the Hawkesbury. It has every in-
gredient used in putting together the
two earlier resuscitated books, plus some
more, such as the Lambing Flat riots,
bushrangers aplenty, flood, famines and
warrigals, all integral in the life of a
bush. But it is different, despite its air
of being written as a novel, in that it is
the story of a woman who was still hale
and hearty enough at 94 to climb a tree
so as to get a better view of cameramen
making a film about the riots of Lambing
Flat and still able to be presented to the
Duke of Gloucester six years later.
The book covers her life from her
birth in the year Queen Victoria came
to the throne, when the free population
of the Australian continent was under
50,000, through most of its phases. She
died the year after King Edward VIII
abdicated. She had seen everything from
days of Tom Icely on the Bland to the
days of Stalin.
A pleasant book, pleasantly illustrated
by Roderick Shaw, and written with a
novelist’s touch.
/Geoffrey Blainey is doing some of
the most important historical work
in Australia in devoting himself to the
mining industry which hitherto has been
the victim of the purveyor of old wives’
tales and company propaganda, mostly
written by unskilled persons without
proper research or training in statement
of fact.
The title of his book is a just epi-
tome of the history of the Australian
metal-mining industry. The object of the
“rushes” has changed from era to era,
and, at the end of each era, mining has
been “finished.” But it invariably rises
from its deathbed and goes on some new
line and after some new metal, frequently
on ground which already has been
trampled over by thousands of hurrying
bluchers and wellingtons scrambling to
some mineralised objective and quite
heedless of the wealth being neglected
beneath them for the coming generations.
Copper was the first metal mined in
Australia on a commercial scale in
South Australia where the products of
Moonta were dug out and exported to
Newcastle to be married to Dr Mit-
chell’s coal the first product to come
out of the earth on any scale in this
continent.
Then Californian experience started
the gold-rushes and for more than 50
years the prospectors and the investors
and speculators followed the glint of yel-
low from Mt Alexander to the Palmer,
most of them men of little skill, imbued

with the great delusion that gold is al-
ways “where the quartz is” until Mt Mor-
gan, with its huge spews of topsy-turvy
formations and rich yields from ore that
looked like blue metal, and Kalgoorlie
ushered in new conceptions. After that,
scientific goldmining and treatment
methods and awareness of the association
of iron and gold ushered in a period of
a generation or more during which the
magic words “gossan cap” became a
conventional inducement to the “Pitt
Street” goldminer to sell his wife’s
pearls in return for a share in a shallow
brown crust of, say, Arnhem Land with
little or nothing but mother earth under
its ferrous surface scab.
Fifty years lay between the dray-sized
nuggets of Eagle Hawk and Hill End
and the ultimate refinement of Captain
Richard’s chlorination process and other
Mt Morgan and South African modern
methods of gold recovery. The rising
price of gold joined the new techniques
to institute the age in which low grade
ore was carved out from the top like
Stilton and dredged to the last penny-
weight of its riches. And the Australian
gold industry learned the great truth
that gold is where you find it in iron-
stone, under limestone bottoms, cased
like opal in mercuric earth as at the
Dee Rush at Struck Oil, or floating like
gossamer out of bismuth ore as in the
fantastic muddle of Tennant Creek where
every indication direction of reefs,
holding material, lack of alluvial gold
ran contrary to all tradition and all
accumulated knowledge.
With the advent of gold as a main
preoccupation, interest in baser metals
which had been developing before the
1850 s faded. Mt Morgan, for instance,
let its rich copper flow away in tailings
until the great drought of 1903 when
individual miners’ enterprise brought its
possibilities sharply to notice, ultimately
turning Mt Morgan, the world’s greatest
goldmine of its time, into a Coppermine
with a gold subsidiary.
ThiE Broken Hill discovery coming as
A Mt Morgan was emerging into view
as the first great organised industrial
undertaking with an increasingly scien-
tific background, wedded mining to
scientific metallurgy and transformed
the industry from a shaft-diggers’ Tom
Tiddler’s ground into modern industrial
enterprise in which everything was on the
grand scale and no product too modest
to be neglected. Broken Hill's discovery
and exploitation marked the most im-
portant development in that its silver-
lead product was the mother of the iron
and steel industry and the incentive to
exploration for base metals on a major
scale.
The eras of discovery, of course, have
not ended, but the present one may well
be described as a culminating age, since
virtually none of Australia which shows
the slightest sign of mineralisation is not
under mining lease to some vast organi-
sation exploring for precious, base, or
rare industrial metals. The whole field of
metallurgy provides a national annual
return second only to that from wool,
and growing as new horizons open up
horizons enlarged by such discoveries
as the vast Pilbarra iron deposits which
ensure the steel needs of the Common-
wealth for generations to come while
providing a huge margin of ore for ex-
port for at least a couple of centuries.
Blarney’s book covers the romance
and practical history of Australian min-
ing in 342 pages from the beginnings
of mineralogical discovery to the age of
uranium, rutile and bauxite and oil, from
Moonta to Mt Isa which, great as
it is, is only the portal to a region as rich
as any undeveloped in the silver-lead
zones of the world, apart from uranium
and other metals.
The book, of course, only touches
the fringes of the subject, but there is
much that is new in it to the average
reader and it provides a reliable basic
guide to mining history for the every-
day reader.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
U. S. Tax Cuts or Recession?
By April, 1964, the current US boom will have lasted
longer than any peacetime boom. Will it go the distance?
As one means of persuading the Senate to approve the
11 billion dollar cut in taxes, the Kennedy Administration
needs to argue that, without the tax cut, an economic setback
will occur. This view already is supported by Mr Heller, chair-
man of JFK’s Council of Economic Advisers, who says that
part of the current prosperity in the US may be attributable
to businessmen’s psychology who already are acting as if the
tax cuts will go through. Wall Street seems to confirm that
view.
Although the Kennedy Administration wants to push the
legislation through before the end of the year, it appears at
this stage that the tax Bill'will not be passed before January.
There is strong opposition to the “rich man’s tax Bill” and 150
witnesses may have to appear before the Senate Finance Com-
mittee.
Galling as this may be to President Kennedy and his team
who at this stage must pre-
fer the popularity of tax cuts
to the problem of segragation
it is nevertheless accepted
that measures such as the tax
cuts and the Interest Equalisa-
tion Tax (to curb the flow of
dollars into overseas loans and
investments) are being treated
as if they already exist in the
Statute Book.
There is a danger in insist-
ing that, without a tax cut, a
recession will occur, because
businessmen may take it into
their heads that the upward
line of industrial production is
overdue for a downturn.
Meanwhile, production of
new model cars is reported at
the highest level for eight
years, output of machinery
and equipment is up 10 per
cent on a year ago and build-
ing is pushing ahead happily.
The only puzzling item, ap-
parently, was the fall in retail
figures for September at a time
when personal incomes were
still rising. Excuse given was
the effect of a prolonged hot
spell.
A few more months should
reveal the trend resulting in
the Administration’s fight to
Growth in Building Approvals 1961-63

close the dollar gap. If it is good, and if there is evidence
of some exporting success after the Kennedy exhortation to
go out and sell, sell, sell like hell, the forecasters will breathe
more freely about the prospects for 1964.
The competitive fight for markets, however, draws into the
spotlight the American cost structure, an important item in
which is the price of steel, a subject adroitly side-stepped
earlier this year by President Kennedy but which is now being
canvassed as the subject of a Federal Grand Jury investigation.
A forced cut in steel prices could cause a flurry in industrial
circles, followed by a stockmarket setback. But financial men
in America don’t regard these matters so seriously as they did
a few years back.
Less Money Raised
by Industry
JTJalk of excess liquidity in the Australian economy takes on
A new significance if analysed against the background of
new money raised by Australian companies in the past three
years. The Commonwealth Statistician’s figures reveal that
public companies raised only
£160.7 million of new funds
in the year to June, 1963,
compared with £ 175.8 m. in
1961-62, £218.9m. in 1960-
61 and £248.3m. in 1959-60.
The same trend is apparent
for companies which are not
listed on the Stock Exchanges.
Final figures for 1962-63 are
not yet available for the un-
listed companies, but the rate
of raising new money has fal-
len from £ 295.4 m. in 1959-
60 to £260.4m. in 1960-61
and £2lO. lm. in 1961-62,
which suggests that possibly
less than £2oom. was raised
in the latest financial year to
June, 1963.
Taking into consideration
the fact that overseas groups
have been pouring money into
various Australian affiliated
companies, it would appear
that the Australian public has
been asked for very little cash
compared with the thirsty,
cash-consuming days of 1960.
True, the finance companies
were borrowing avidly in those
days. But this is only part
of the story.
If it is accepted that a coun-
try’s general rate of expansion
entails a fairly consistent annual increase in the amount of
new money sought from the public, then Australian companies
should have raised at least £4oom. more than they have since
1960.


Using 1959-60 as a base and ignoring any possible upward
trend in new money raising since that year, public companies
would have raised a further £l9Bm. in the three years to
June 1963, while private companies would have raised £2oom.
or more (if they had maintained the 1960 rate of fund raising).
The year 1959-60, of course, was an abnormal or an ex-
tremely buoyant year for new fund raising and, if the trend
had continued, it is argued that the generating effects from so
much borrowed money would have accentuated an inflationary
boom.
So, to the extent that the public was not asked to subscribe
this extra £400m., it could be claimed that the money went
somewhere else (if the public had that much money to lend).
Obviously, a high proportion of any cash surplus in the public’s
hands would go into Commonwealth bonds, savings banks and
building. But there is plenty more still floating around, and not
all of it is earmarked for the purchase of new cars or new
homes.
Incidentally, the Statistician’s figures indicate that manu-
facturing groups kept on raising extra amounts of new money
after 1960, although showing a sharp fall in 1962-63. This
group presumably would include BHP, whose share capital
and loan raisings distort the picture.
Calming the Liquidity
Excitements
Dr H. C. Coombs, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Aus-
tralia, saw fit to pour oil on troubled waters when the upheaval
on liquidity became too choppy. It will be reassuring to some
people to note that the Reserve
Bank some months ago told
the trading banks that it did
not want to see a continuation
of new lending commitments.
At the end of September again
the trading banks were warn-
ed to keep their new lending
commitments within the level
suggested earlier by the Re-
serve Bank.
The trading banks, faced
with the problem of suit-
ably employing their funds, and
noting that the public horse
could be led to liquidity with-
out drinking, doubtless were
vigilant within their own in-
ternal banking policy to see
New Money Raised by Australian Companies
that things did not get out of hand. The private trading banks
are never given sufficient credit for this.
Despite the high liquidity, therefore, there is little change
in policy. The money is available to finance the present eco-
nomic recovery. But if signs appear that it will surge forward
suddenly, the brakes most certainly will be applied sensibly
within the central bank framework already provided.
Manufacturers Start to
Borrow Once More
Tf Australian companies have raised less capital and borrowed
less debenture money since 1960, did they rely more on
the trading banks? The answer is “No.”
At least this is so up to a period of slightly more than two
years since December, 1960. In later months there was an
increase in bank lending and overdraft limits. But, as of January
1963, total advances were £ 14.8 m. lower than in December
1960. Notable exceptions were rural advances, building and
construction, mining, personal loans to individuals and loans
to non-profit organisations.
Loans to manufacturers were down from £224.4m. in
December 1960 to £ 191.9 m. in January 1963, but they had
picked up to £217.7m. by July, according to the Reserve
Bank’s latest Statistical Bulletin of September, 1963. The July
figure of bank loans to manufacturers includes £9.6m. of
fixed term loans.
After a relatively lean period of expansion, manufacturers
have shown definite signs of stirring restlessly in recent months.
Some are still cautious, particularly those who face intense
competition in the consumer appliance field. Others are hopeful
of enjoying at least a good half-year before any credit squeeze
looms again..
Chemical Changers Form
Closer Linkage
a mystical hue about the new trade association to be
called the Australian Chemical Industry Council registered
in Melbourne last week as a limited company without share
capital because although there are untold companies using
chemicals for mixing, formulating, compounding and packag-
ing in Australia none of these is eligible for membership,
which is restricted to those involved in chemical changes. So
we expect to see the pocket of the new club’s blazer with a
touch of Barrie in it, say a Mary Rose.
Naturally the new club’s address will be 1 Nicholson Street,
where more chemical changes
are perpetrated than anywhere
else in Australia and of the
companies employing more
than 10,000 Australians and
having an investment of more
than £lOO million the faces of
most of them are familiar in
the trade. Those who seem to
be most behind the idea are
named in the Memorandum
and Articles of Association.
They are the giants of the
business, such as ICIANZ,
Shell Chemical, CSR Chemi-
cal, Altona Petrochemical,
Monsanto and Union Carbide.
With this line up, together
with a host of other com-
panies which have been associated in its formation, the Council
obviously means business, which is stated to be to advance the
use of Australian-made chemicals and chemical products, to
stress the importance of the chemical industry in the Australian
economy (who doubts that for a moment!), to support member
companies in preparing and presenting cases for tariff protec-
tion (this is getting nearer the heart of the matter), to assist
research and get an industry-wide approach to problems rang-
ing from safety and fire protection to packaging and labelling.
In giving the new Council a send-off, the Council’s executive
director, Mr M. A. H. Blair, who was previously with Federal
Chemical in Melbourne, said that the Australian chemical
industry with its annual output approaching £7O million was
as basic to the economy as steel manufacture and power
generation. Indeed, the wonder is that the industry hasn’t got
together in a big trade association long before this. But will
Sir Garfield be all that pleased!


“Big Lift” to Save
US Dollars
A Frenchman needs no reason for making love. But for most
other things Europeans invariably look for a reason. That
is why Uncle Sam’s “big lift” of an armoured division from
Texas to France and Germany set the Europeans thinking.
It was a most impressive display of mobility which involved
transporting a complete division within three days. Why did
the Americans do it?
The hard, materialistic conclusion reached by most observers
was that America wishes to reduce dollar expenditure in Europe
by withdrawing US troops. Uncle Sam wants Europeans to
shoulder greater military responsibility, but, in case they panic
at the thought of a US reduction of military forces, the
Americans demonstrated they can fly quickly across the
Atlantic if any trouble occurs.
It wasn't as if the Americans were withdrawing their equip-
ment from Europe. The tanks, guns and supplies will remain
on the site at various German and French supply depots. Key
personnel, together with small arms and extra equipment, can
be flown in at will to wherever they are needed. The airlift
included 1500 hard-to-replace air force personnel who flew
to Europe in their own reconnaissance aircraft.
The mission was hailed by the Americans as a great success.
But the Europeans pointed out there was no opposition to the
“big lift,” which could have turned out to be nothing but a big
massacre under wartime conditions.
Without going so far as a shooting war, however, the
Americans were only trying to prove that this was one way
in which the heavy and aggravating military expenditure in
Europe could be cut back. Unfortunately, Europeans other
than General de Gaulle regard the expenditure of US dollars
in Europe as an economic necessity.
Britain and the Six Make
Much Closer Contact
HThe process of bringing Great Britain organisationally and
• functionally nearer to the European Economic Community
took a positive and harmonious turn with the end-October
Ministerial meeting of Western European Union at The
Hague. This occasion gave the first official contact at such
levels since Britain was rejected by the Common Market last
January.
There should be little necessity to labor the eventual
implication of these continuous mutual discussions for Aus-
tralia. Significantly the next meeting is called for London in
the latter part of January next.
No question yet arises, or can for some considerable time,
of Britain re-applying for EEC membership. Both Sir Alec
Douglas-Home and Mr R. A. Butler have made that patently
clear.
Yet Mr Butler, who as Foreign Secretary represented
Britain at The Hague assembly, clearly understands his
European responsibilities and the trends of repeated talks in
“problems of mutual interest”.
“While we recognise that we are barred from joining the
Community, we wish to enjoy the closest possible relations
with them, politically and economically. This meeting has
shown how much we have in common with the Six and how
much work we can do together,” he stated, adding a further
plea for wider European integration.
Of extra importance to major primary producing countries
like Australia must be the Western European Union’s stress
on agriculture still a bugbear among the Six, who have
far from cemented their desired common agricultural policy.
Decidedly in surface opposition to the French, Germany’s
Foreign Minister, Dr Gerhard Schroder, declared that agri-
culture has to take its place in the trade liberalisation pro-
gramme which is the principal aim of the Kennedy Round-
GATT gatherings to begin next year.
Dr Schroder would allow agriculture to become “negotiable”
even if the Six do not reach their common farm policy in
time.
He has recently given further hints that the EEC will have
to reconsider its attitudes towards “traditional” suppliers and
continued access. Commonwealth countries can surely prick
up their ears at these words. The phrases were highly
familiar around January last and have hardly lost their
meanings since.
Ready Mixed Concrete’s
UK Windfall
Oeady Mixed Concrete’s sale of all its 52.79 p.c. holding
* in Ready Mixed Concrete (United Kingdom) Ltd
possesses more than a mere Stock Exchange interest, albeit
local shareholders stand to gain Is. a share capital return
and probable later benefits from expansive domestic
possibilities.
Not many Australian companies have managed to push
their operational ambit as far as Britain, Europe, Israel and
Trinidad. These are precisely the places covered by the UK
group.
Loss of such exotic spheres does not take all the glamor
from RMC. There’s still Malaya and Brazil, apart from
Australia’s mainland.
The sale price of £A7,411,696, producing a startling
capital profit at £5,010,696, presents a handsome accession
to company liquidity and a measurable addition to this
country’s overseas reserves. RMC must have been fascinated
with the high premium enjoyed by the UK shares, probably
needing only the barest nudging from English merchant
banker Schroder Wagg which is handling the sale and London
disposition of the shares.
On a more prosaic level Australian shareholders should
quickly be given a clear indication of company plans,
especially after the company’s fairly recent vicissitudes. RMC
furnishes plenty of evidence of over-capitalisation, so share-
holders might well feel a larger return could be justified.
The first announcement didn’t sound completely thrilling
in having to mention possible “small” withdrawals from
reserves to meet proposed higher dividends on the reduced
capital. Effective and comparatively speedy use of the new
funds is vital.
Spurning a Status Symbol
for Respectability
rpHE anti-Mafia drive in Sicily, following appointment of a
special parliamentary commission in July, has slashed
sales of Alfa Romeo cars. The unexpected situation prompted
the Minister of State for Industry to complain to the Minister
of the Interior that the anti-Mafia drive was causing great
harm to the national car industry.
Road blocks erected by police to inspect gun licences re-
sulted in the arrest of many junior Mafia bosses who seemed
to prefer Alfa Romeo sports cars as a status symbol. Ordinary
citizens, afraid of being stopped and mistaken for gangsters
gave up driving around in Alfa Romeo cars. This is one for
the ad men to figure out.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Exports Running Almost Too Well
Boom Born in Commodity Markets
JFhe great difference between the full
employment situations of 1960 and
1963 is that the latter is accompanied by
stability at home and rising overseas
balances and gives no immediate reason
for the authorities to interfere with the
rate of economic activity. All through
1960 exactly the opposite was happen-
ing and the strong case for official action
to ease the pressure of demand on re-
sources went unheeded until sledge-
hammer measures were needed to stop
the pressure of excessive demand on the
country’s available internal and over-
seas resources.
The unique feature of the present situ-
ation is that the rise in our overseas
balances, which has taken them up £4l
million since the end of June to the
second highest on record, has not been
reflected in any noticeable rise in effec-
tive demand. By all the rules of the
game these new boosts to potential in-
come generation from external account
at a time when unemployment is little
more than hard-core and liquidity in the
system already very high should be set-
ting up danger signals, especially in the
banking system. One would normally
expect the authorities to be taking some
counter action to neutralise them.
Australia’s buoyant overseas receipts
from record export sales and other
sources such as Government loans and
capital inflow are showing up in very
strongly rising trading bank deposits. In
the three months to end-September
trading bank deposits increased by
£33.5 million to £1956.9 million and
are expected to show another substantial
rise in October. In the same three
months last year deposits increased by
only £2.4 million to £1826.6 million.
TAespite this year’s sharp increase the
Reserve Bank appears to be in no
hurry to mop up any more of these de-
posits in its statutory reserves. For though
it is not usual to make big calls from the
trading banks until later, that it has not
made any yet is proof enough that at
any rate up to now Dr Coombs has been
confident that the high present liquidity
of the banks has not threatened to
foment excessive effective demand in the
system.
One of the main reasons for this is
that although in the three months to
September the overdraft limits extended
by the trading banks increased by £33i
million to £1845.2 million, actual ad-
vances fell by £13.3 million in those
three months, the fall being more than
accounted for by the drop of £15.7
million in September. In the same period
last year overdraft limits increased by
£30.2 million to £1752.1 million while
advances increased £15.1 million to
£1046.5 million.
Even taking the rough measure of
total advances being about 4 p.c. higher
in September this year than a year earlier,
this is hardly enough to keep the authori-
ties awake at night. Considering gross
national product probably increased by
more than 4 p.c. over the year, the rise
in advances looks very moderate indeed.
Although the generality of the banks’
customers in industry have been seeking
and getting progressively higher borrow-
ing limits, this seems to have been more
because they are suspicious that the high
liquidity of the system might cause the
authorities to put the screw on bank
lending rather than because of any press-
ing needs or lack of available funds for
their own businesses. It is obvious from
the very moderate increase in bank ad-
vances over the last year that industry
is itself very comfortably pursed up and
also able to draw liberally from the
flooded money streams outside the banks
to cater for its financing without having
to avail itself fully of bank accommoda-
tion.
Tt is as though with the present high
A state of liquidity in the whole sys-
tem the banks are being regarded as a
residual source of short-term funds to
which industry only wants to have fuller
recourse when its other sources of
finance tighten. This could be the basic
reason why the Reserve Bank feels that
even with such high bank liquidity ratios,
bank-lending presents no immediate
threat to monetary equilibrium, though
even if the overall demand for credit is
still subdued the Governor can hardly be
happy at a situation in which so many
lines to credit supplies are out of his
control. The fact is that in present
circumstances even if he reduced bank
liquidity to the minimum it would have
little overall effect on the credit situation
one way or the other.
Probably his most comforting thought
is that the Government has shown itself
so active in raising two loans instead of
one so far this year to mop up surplus
money in the system. But even on that
point he could have reservations in that
this method of tapping the surplus weak-
ens the pressure of money on commercial
borrowing rates and thus on the use-
ability of credit supplies outside the
banking system, so delaying the day
when action on bank liquidity ratios can
become effective in credit control.
While there is cause for some unease
about this complex credit situation, at
least given the present cautious industrial
demand for credit there is no present
danger of the high availability of credit
being translated into excessive effective
demand, particularly while investment in
secondary industry continues to hang fire
and industrial output, especially in con-
sumer durables, remains subdued. How-
ever, the activation of the growing total
of deposits in other ways than by in-
creasing bank advances has to be
reckoned with as a boosting influence on
effective demand.
Ane refers, of course, to the greater in-
centives to spending in primary in-
dustry, to which most of the increase
in deposits is accruing. Primary industry
was singled out for concessions in the
last Budget which gave it a 20 p.c. in-
vestment allowance on new plant and
equipment to add to its special 20 p.c.
depreciation allowance and also a super-
phosphate bounty of £3 a ton. In addi-
tion primary industry stands to gain from
the higher retention allowances for pri-
vate companies.
It so happens that the Treasurer has
given these concessions in what promises
to be Australian primary industry’s best
export year ever. Already in three months
exports have totalled <£315.8 million
giving an annual rate of £1,260 million.
At the same stage last year exports were
only £227.1 million and finished the
year with a total of £1,070 million. As
world commodity prices, in particular
some of our best earners such as wool,
sugar, meat, lead and zinc, are still
heading higher, it would be very sur-
prising if there was not a very big in-
crease in effective demand from the
rural sector this year.
So we have the situation where not
only have spending incentives been in-
creased in the rural sector but that sector
will have so much more to spend this
year. Of course this will flow mainly into
the rest of the economy, giving a strong
multiplying effect on incomes and busi-
ness. Moreover this will follow a year
when rural incomes were the highest
since the early 19505. The effect should
be heightened by having two good export
years in succession.
This drive from primary industry was
missing in the 1959-60 boom which was
mainly ths product of locally-generated
demand. IjQi tho three years to June,
1961, exports were very relatively low,
that Is 36806.7 m., £925.9m., and
£928 million. The way the present ex-
port year is shaping our next boom looks
like being born in world commodity
markets.


LONDON COMMENT
Improving the Board of Trade
Modernising in down-to-earth matters
By SAMUEL BHUTAN
Who would have thought it
the Tories taking over Harold
Wilson’s idea of a Production
Ministry less than three weeks after he
suggested it at Scarborough? For this is
really what is involved in Edward
Heath’s new appointment, and clearly
we are going to have a lot of jockeying
for position among economics ministers
during the next few months.
To begin with there is Edward Heath’s
cumbersome title, “Secretary of State for
Industry, Trade and Regional Develop-
ment and President of the Board of
Trade.” Some cynic is bound to shorten
it to Chief Steward to Sir Alec. Then
there are the warning shots from the
Treasury to say that “overall responsi-
bility” remains with the Chancellor, and
explaining that, apart from regional
development, Heath has no more powers
than his predecessor.
But if we look beyond the fun and
games, the split in functions between
Maudling and Heath is in economic
terms perfectly right. It is certainly
better than cutting the Treasury in two,
giving one half to Brown and the other
to Callaghan.
Economic policy falls naturally into
two compartments. There is the regula-
tion of the economy as a whole
budgetary and monetary policy, inter-
national lending and borrowing, ex-
change rates, incomes policy and all
the other instruments required for steer-
ing the ship. These are the Treasury’s
responsibilities; they are indivisible; and
if the Treasury has steered too
cautiously, the right remedy is to reform
the Treasury, not to appoint an over-
lord to breathe down its neck.
other side of economic policy
covers detailed improvement in the
efficiency of particular industries and
regions, industrial management, training
practices and similar down -to - earth
matters with which the practical business-
man is concerned. The Treasury may
spot all sorts of weaknesses on this side,
but it is simply not equipped to interfere
at ground level. The Ministry responsible
here has all along been the Board of
Trade.
Both Labor’s demand for a Production
Ministry and the frequent attacks on
the Treasury are in large part a disguised
way of saying that the Board of Trade is
not doing its job. Some of its officials
are amongst the most dynamic in White-
hall; they tend to be the exception rather
than the rule. Too many Board men lack
equally the logical acumen of the
Treasury mandarins and the down-to-
earth qualities of the businessman.
Recent Presidents of the Board of
Trade have held a lowly status in the
Cabinet; one sometimes wondered if
Mr Macmillan knew their names.
“They talk about GATT or something
boring,” one highly placed observer
recently told me. And at international
trade conferences Britain was not taken
seriously if she was represented only by
the President of the Board of Trade.
The thing about the National Economic
Development Council that is most valued
within the Government is its contacts
with industry. These are now being
strengthened by the creation of little
Neddies for particular trades.
X>ut hobnobbing with industry is sup-
posed to be among the functions of
the Board of Trade; Neddy might never
have been invented if the Board had
been doing all it should.
Now Mr Heath has taken the bull by
the horns. Instead of creating new in-
stitutions, he is trying to improve the
morale, standing and capabilities of the
Board. On deeper reflection, it should
be in the Chancellor’s own interest to
encourage Mr Heath rather than to
obstruct him.
The more Mr Heath can succeed in
evening out the pace of development
from one region to another and the more
he can raise the efficiency of lagging
industries, the easier it will be for Mr
Maudling to achieve expansion with
minimal inflation. Similarly Neddy’s
experts should be pleased that they may
soon have opposite numbers in the
Government machine ready and eager to
examine their better ideas.
Comment on Mr Heath’s new post
has largely concentrated on the regional
side. But some of the most interesting
and intractable conundrums are con-
cerned with efficiency and modernisa-
tion. Here is a field where the cliche
slogans about planning or free enterprise
do not help and where both alternatives
—telling industry how to do its job and
leaving it completely alone —are equally
inappropriate.
Monopolies and mergers are one cry-
ing example. In a great many British
industries, including machine tools and
shipyards, there are far too many small
or inefficient firms that ought to be
amalgamated or closed down. There is
a case for having a strong Minister to
attempt a rationalisation operation of
the kind Mr Sandys forced through in
the aircraft industry.
A lot of the energy of the French
planners has been expended on a cam-
paign to encourage mergers. On the
other hand, not all mergers are good
ones. Beyond a certain level, they are
merely means of financial empire-build-
ing, or of exploiting monopoly powers
which bring little improved efficiency.
An ideal policy must at one and the
same time encourage mergers in some
fields and yet subject all large take-overs
and amalgamations to critical scrutiny,
making sure that benefits outweigh dis-
advantages.
Another tricky field is company law.
Most reforms here have simply tried to
protect the shareholder from fraud or
deception. Little attempt has been made
to use company law to improve the
efficiency of the capitalist system.
I hope that before he sets to work
on a new Companies Act Mr Heath
will examine the suggestions made by
Mr Harold Rose, in a recent Eaton
paper, about making companies disclose
more information. This would both
improve the quality of investment
decisions and reveal for all to see the
strengths and weaknesses of individual
firms.
A third area where Mr Heath will
have to tread very delicately indeed is
relations with companies. Up to now
the Government has acted on a basis
of “equity,” that is, not favoring one
firm more than any other. There is
surely something to be said for fostering
those firms which are most progressive.
Safeguards against favoritism and abuse
would have to be devised, yet there is a
case for some swing of the pendulum if
we (and Sir Alec) are serious about
modernising Britain, (ofns.)

“CROESUS”
Green Light from Reserves
A bountiful kitty , and more prospects
JFhose who like to take their economics
in simple doses without knowing
very much about the complicated in-
gredients will have had a good deal of
satisfaction from the official statement
of the balance of payments for the Sep-
tember quarter.
This showed that, for once in a while,
the surplus on the balance of trade in
goods was just about the same as the
addition to our international reserves
over the three months period, £43m.
compared with £4l million in rounded
off figures.
But to get at this very neat result the
Commonwealth Statistician had to en-
gage in his usual flirtation with unidenti-
fied capital movements, the results of
which caused the “SMH” to use the head-
line “drop in inflow of capital” on the
same day as the “Financial Review” head-
lined “improvement in capital inflow.”
This conflict of interpretation on
Broadway seems to confirm in their wis-
dom those who prefer to remain in the
dark about these so-called movements
in net apparent capital inflow. For the
record it may be useful to state that
net apparent capital inflow of £7O mil-
lion in the September quarter was lower
than the £B9 million in the June quar-
ter, lower than the £94 million in the
September quarter last year and also a
bare fraction lower than the quarterly
average of £72 million for the year
ended June 1963.
T?or some reason unknown to The Bul-
letin, the “Financial Review” drew
its headline from the fact that in the last
two quarters capital inflow averaged
nearly £BO million a quarter compared
with only £37 million for the March
quarter. As it said, this is a sharp
improvement. Indeed the right emphasis
is on the line that capital inflow is highly
satisfactory, even if it was slightly less
so in the September quarter when a
deficit of £26 million on current ac-
count (net invisibles exceeded the visible
surplus of £43 million by £69 million)
was more than comfortably cancelled
out by a net increase of £7O million
in apparent capital inflow.
This was a very satisfactory result,
the more so because there was a net
capital outflow of £l5 million attributed
to non-private movements in the Sep-
tember quarter w'hereas in each of the
four previous quarters there was a net
gain from such movements (amounting
to £37 million for the full year 1962-
63). In effect private capital inflow looks
to have been at about £7B million for
the September quarter, which is only
£2 million less than the June quarter’s
£BO million the highest for two
years.
As capital inflow will gain £25 mil-
lion in the current quarter from the re-
cent loan in London, private capital in-
flow needs only to keep up the rate
achieved in the September quarter to
give us one of the best quarters ever
for total capital inflow. And judging by
the sharp upward movement in re-
serves, which have gained a further
£2B million in the last fortnight, this
seems to be happening, though of course
until the October overseas trade figures
come to hand there is no way of esti-
mating the contribution of capital move-
ments.
A s exports seem destined to continue
their buoyancy in the next few
months, the big imponderable in the bal-
ance of payments outlook is the likely
course of imports. Although the £271
million bill for imports in the September
quarter was the highest since March
quarter 1961 ’s £272 million, it showed
only a modest increase on both the
(quarters) September 1962’s £262 million
and on June 1963’s £265 million. More-
over imports of £89.2 million in the
month of September were the lowest for
the latest quarter, comparing with £96.4
million and £99.7 million in the two
previous months. In fact September im-
ports were the lowest since last March
and only £1.7 million more than in
September last year.
Movements of stocks in the Sep-
tember quarter are not available yet
but going on the September figure for
production which shows that output de-
clined in 17 industries and increased in
16 on the month, coupled with the lull
in importing, there is nothing to support
the view that industry is building up
its stocks for a big leap in output which
will call for a substantial lift in the
imports bill. Indeed, disappointed in its
expectations that an upsurge in public
spending would ensue from the overall
rise in income generation in the last
year, industry appears to have been
moving forward only very slowly this
year (the production index of the ANZ
Bank confirms this up to July and the
Commonwealth Statistician’s figures
since).
One would expect the October figures
to show some improvement in industrial
output in advance of Christmas spend-
ing and that this will provide a spring-
board for an all round increase in output
after the election and holiday season are
over. Industry’s increased requirements
for raw materials and components in
that case would show up in considerably
higher import bills in January and sub-
sequent months, but given continued
buoyancy in exports and capital inflow
coupled with the existing near record
total of overseas funds these bills would
be easily accommodated without impair-
ing the strength of our external position.
Although this situation has the seeds
of considerable industrial expansion in
it, there is no reason why, given the
present propensity to spend, it need
threaten price stability any more than it
poses a threat to the balance of pay-
ments. The essential point is that there
is room for a big increase in industrial
output and that such an increase will
be needed to accommodate the step-up
in income generation which one must
expect as a result of the accumulating
overseas balances and favorable internal
portents alike.
It would be a mistake to put too much
emphasis on the excess liquidity in the
system as a warning against allowing
this expansion to proceed uninhibited,
because as pointed out elsewhere in this
issue of The Bulletin the authorities
stand to mop a lot of it up in Govern-
ment loans and otherwise can mitigate
its effects both by curbing Government
expenditure and making heavy seasonal
calls on bank deposits into statutory re-
serve deposit account at the Reserve
Bank. Even in the event of an increase
in the propensity to spend, which Sir
lan Potter last week rightly called “un-
predictable,” it would have to be quite
considerable before either gravely up-
setting the internal balance or calling for
measures to strengthen the balance of
payments.
TTowever, two warnings seem war-
ranted. One is that a Government not
prepared to curb its internal expenditure
could put the economy in jeopardy in
1964. The second is that it is obvious
from present intentions to step up over-
seas expenditure on defence that it would
be wise to earmark a considerable part
of present overseas funds for this pur-
pose before reckoning the sum available
for normal needs.
But with these reservations, the boun-
tiful kitty of reserves and the excellent
prospects for building it up further show
the green light for a new round of
industrial expansion.


The Great Sugar Gamble
Having an each-way bet
Australia’s booming sugar industry
is taking up a challenge that will
either make it one of the nation’s
top export income earners, bringing in
something like £lOO million a year in
five years’ time, or that will cause con-
siderable excess capacity and depressed
conditions in the same period.
The gamble—calculated fairly finely
comes in a report of the three-man
Sugar Industry Inquiry Committee. The
Committee, Mr Justice Gibbs (chairman),
Mr Otto Wolfensberger (chairman of
the Queensland Sugar Board) and Mr
Norman King (of the Bureau of Sugar
Experiment Stations), was appointed
only in June to examine and report on
long-term production targets of the
sugar industry.
Its report was tabled in the Queens-
land Parliament last week.
The Committee’s recommendations
were for a remarkable lift in sugar pro-
duction by extension of existing mill
areas to embrace a further 150,407 acres
of new sugarcane plantings. The plan
envisaged just 1000 more sugarcane
growers coming into the industry within
a few years.
At June 30 last year the industry in
Queensland covered 591,593 acres
held by 6971 growers. So the expansion
in cane-growing is a substantial one. Of
course it doesn’t end here. There are
many facilities to be provided to cater
for the increased cane output.
The Inquiry report recommends
growth by area, with the four major
Queensland districts all to share in the
growth.
• Ingham - Mossman. To increase
plantings by 68,110 acres. Raw sugar
production from the existing 10 mills
in the district was 622,000 tons to make
up one - third of the Australian pro-
duction.. The 10 mills here are:
Capacity
tons Owner
Mossman Central 44,100 Co-op.
Hambledon 59,900 CSR
Mulgrave 56,200 Co-op.
Babinda 60,300 Co-op.

Mourilyan 46,400 Aust. Sugar
South Johnstone 63,800 Co-op.
Tully 68,900 Co-op.
Victoria 111,400 CSR
Macknade 63,200 CSR
Port facilities at Cairns, Mourilyan
and Lucinda will have to be expanded.
Mourilyan and Lucinda are mechanical
bulk-loading ports, while Cairns is
currently being converted from a
manual-loading port to be ready in
1964.
• Burdekin. Plantings to increase
19,514 acres. The four mills in this dis-
trict produced 251,300 tons of raw
sugar last year. The mills will have to
be expanded considerably to meet the
increased demand on them. The four
mills are:

Invicta 35,200 Haughton Sugar Co.
Pioneer 61,900 Pioneer Sugar Mills
Kalamia 70,200 Australian Estates
Inkerman 84,000 Pioneer Sugar Mills

Townsville
• Mackay. Plantings to increase
30,912 acres. Eight mills in the district
the industry’s second largest pro-
duced 552,700 tons of milled sugar last
year. The mills, and last year’s capacity,
are:

Port facilities, mechanical, are at

O South. Increased plantings totalling
31,871 acres are planned for this dis-
trict which covers the Bundaberg area.
There are nine mills currently operating
in the district.

M’borough 29,400 Maryborough S.
Moreton 23,700 Moreton Central
Sugar
Rocky Point 5,300 W. H. Heck &
Sons
Mechanical port facilities at Bunda-
berg handled most of the raw sugar pro-
duced at these mills, although some is
sent (from Maryborough and Moreton)
direct to Brisbane.
The balance of the sugar industry is
in Northern NSW, where Colonial Sugar
Refining operates three mills capable of
producing about 80,000 tons of raw
sugar.
The report assumes that the NSW
position will remain as it is currently.
The emphasis falls solely on Queens-
land.
The report clearly recommends that
there be no new mill areas nor any
duplication of mills. However, it expects
considerable expansion of the mill
facilities listed above.
The target production figures set by
the Committee are considerably in
excess of the record 1,802,000 tons pro-
duced in 1962. Present plans allow for
expansion of raw sugar production to
about 2,000,000 tons by 1964-65. The
Committee now recommends the follow-
ing growth pattern:
Tons of
raw sugar
1962- 1,802,000
1963- 1,900,000
1964- 2,000,000
1965- 2,200,000
1966- 2,200,000
1967- 2,200,000
1968- 2,350,000
1969- 2,350,000
1970- 2,500,000
It has been estimated that the 1970-71
target will require the investment of
£5O million over the next few years.
Bulk storage facilities for instance
will have to be increased 50 p.c. from
the present effective capacity of 755,000
tons to 1,135,000 tons by 1970-71.
There are three factors exerting pressure
on the need for storage and each pro-
vides the basis for the reason for the
great leap forward recommended by
the Committee.
Expansion of the industry must in-
crease the proportion available for
export since the growth of the home
market will be limited to population
growth less tne slowly dwindling con-
sumption of the commodity in Aus-
tralia. Evidence was given to the Com-
mittee that Australian consumption of
refined sugar would be around 632,000
tons in 1970-71, just 97,000 tons more
than the current consumption.
Therefore there will be great pressure
on CSR, as the exporting agent for the
whole crop, to provide a stable source
of supply to overseas buyers as this and
quality are the two factors controllable
and important to the development of
contractual sales. Stability in world
markets will add to this responsibility.
Markets would easily be lost if Aus-
tralia did not carry stocks the year
round to meet slack season commit-
ments.
Also, Australia will find it necessary
to carry stocks of raw sugar from one
season to the next to meet obligations
abroad in the event of a delayed or
poor subsequent season.
Third, it will fall on Australia, as the
largest potential exporter of sugar, to

DEPRECIATION WORRIES
FLEET OWNERS
Recent reports indicate that fleet owners
are expressing extreme concern in relation
to ever increasing vehicle depreciations.
In the past, they stated, profits on the
sale of their old fleets could be written back
into their companies’ books, as sale prices
often exceeded the depreciated values. To-
day, however, they are experiencing ex-
treme difficulty in obtaining figures any-
where near book values.
LEASING GROWS
As a result of the high depreciation factor,
the cost of administration and the numerous
intangible factors, fleet owners and opera-
tors are realising just how expensive an item
transport really is. For these and numerous
other reasons, many of Australia’s largest
and most progressive companies have turned
to leasing their vehicle fleets.
OVER 2,000 VEHICLES
The needs of the fleet owners are being
met by Kays Leasing Corporation Pty. Ltd.,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kay Corpora-
tion Limited, which now operates over 2,000
lease vehicles and is writing business at a
greatly accelerated rate.
If your company fleet is causing you

provide reserve or strategic stocks of the
commodity to be released when world
shortages develop and to be built up in
slacker times. The CSR chief manager
of sugar marketing (Mr R. G. Jackson)
told the Committee that there were some
disadvantages to building up reserve
stocks based on cost of holding stocks
in relation to the market value of them.
Also there was the ever-present risk
that reserves may get out of hand as
had happened in the United States in
other commodities.
Mr Jackson, in giving his evidence,
pointed out that Australia had reason-
ably assured markets for the commodity
that would take up a good deal of the
expanded production targets. His assess-
ments which are estimates based on
known commitments plus reasonably
certain extensions of the local market
plus additional “possible” market oppor-
tunities, are:
Tons of
raw sugar
1965- 2,100,000
1966- 2,110,000
1967- 2,130,000
1968- 2,170,000
1969- 2,220,000
1970- 2,248,000
That balance between these “reason-
ably” assured sales and the target pro-
duction represents the gamble that the
industry is taking.
Mr Jackson in his evidence pointed
out that international trade in sugar
was not expanding at the same rate as
world production. He showed that
although world production of sugar
amounted to 51 million tons in 1962
only 10 million tons entered world
trade, the rest being consumed in the
producing country. And of that 10
million tons the major part of it was
sold under special price arrangement,
leaving only a very small percentage of
the world crop to be traded on the “free
market”.
This was the basic reason why the
“free” price was subject to the violent
fluctuations which beset the trade,
similar to the current one which has
seen the “free” price boom up to
£stg 105 a ton compared with £stg24 a
ton a little over a year ago.
But it is true that Australia’s exports
in the past year or two have grown at
a faster rate than has international trade
in the staple. This reflects, according
to Mr Jackson, the industry’s ability
to respond rapidly to market oppor-
tunities in relation to other producers
because of the organisational structure
of the industry and the advantages of
operating out of a developed country.
(Australia is probably the best developed
of the sugar producing countries.) For
instance, world imports of sugar in-
creased 30 p.c. between 1959 and 1962
mainly as a result of USSR and China
imports, yet Australia’s exports moved
up 80 p.c. from 647,000 tons to
1,144,000 tons.
As Mr Jackson said:
“Price instability not a new pheno-
menon. Readily available records of raw
sugar prices, c.i.f. London, go back to
1728. Through most of the period since
1728, sugar prices have tended to
instability. A broad picture is given by
centuries as follows:
Approximate price range c.i.f. London
£stg per ton
Lowest Highest
18th century £lB £B7
19th century £9 £97
20th century £4 £146
“Thus instability of free market prices
is no new phenomenon. In the 19th and
20th centuries, the sugar trade has been
characterised by a succession of wars
causing hoarding, interference with in-
ternational trade and reduction of
supplies; followed by high prices stimu-
lating increased production outside the
war zone; followed in turn by further
moves to self-sufficiency in importing
countries.
“The war booms have been followed
by periods of price decline, which have
each led to attempts at international
regulation of the market in an attempt
to support the price level.
“The pattern has become so well
recognised that a threat of war, not
leading to widespread hostilities, can
initiate a boom as in the Suez crisis).”
Mr Jackson, in concluding his
principal evidence, said:
“In my evidence frequent reference
has been made, directly and by implica-
tion, to risks inherent in expansion.
These risks are of three kinds:
• Will the price be high enough in
relation to our costs?
• Will we have sufficient access to
markets—that is, in the sense of
not being frustrated by exclusion
from regional blocs, by discrimina-
tory action of importing countries,
or by international regulation of
our exports?
• Even if we are not denied suf-
ficient access to markets, will we
be able to sell our commodity
commercially?
“To be over-fearful of risks would
lead to stagnation; to ignore the risks
might endanger the stability of our
industry. In marketing planning of
recent years, the approach has been to
seek to identify the various risks
involved in maintaining our position, or
in expansion, and to seek ways of re-
ducing or containing the risks. This
approach is thought to have been useful
in the past and may serve us in the
future.”


Used Car Market Stays Strong
But the trade lives “almost from day to day”
Used-car dealers in Sydney
mostly deny they are being hit by
the boom in new car sales. They
are not scared by the decision of
William Street new car dealers to
stay open in the weekends. They
are getting the benefit of an in-
creased flow of vehicles in circula-
tion when trade-ins force more
cars on to the market. But not
everyone is happy, because one
dealer told a BULLETIN reporter
last week that stiff terms by
finance companies were hampering
sales.
/Opinions sought last week differed
widely on current trends in the used
car trade, depending on the make, model
and price range handled. But there was
no obvious evidence that dealers were
going broke.
“In the used car trade we live almost
from day to day,” said an ex-
ecutive of a large Sydney
second-hand car yard.
Another dealer, slightly more
optimistic, said the trade lived
from week to week.
Some gave the impression the
bubble had burst, some said it
hadn’t even begun to inflate.
One, really in the doldrums,
wondered when the queue
would start forming at the Gap.
But despite all the pessimism,
the impression given was that
used car dealers in Sydney are
enjoying a strong market with
good prices.
The executive of a large used
car dealer said the market was
“ephemeral.”
He said it was “something
you can’t put your finger on.”
There appeared to be no reason
why second hand cars were so
popular, nor why prices were
running at such a constant
level.
His summation of the used car market
echoes the feelings of most Sydney used
car dealers.
He said: “In the motor trade we live
almost from day to day. At present the
used car market is very strong, prices
are firm, good clean vehicles are hard to
come by.
“The used car market is subject to
fluctuations with new model releases,
liquidation programmes which accom-
pany the new models and the weather.”
On this basis most of the used car
dealers judge their trade. There is a
marked difference between the purely
used car dealers and the used car dealers
with a new car franchise.
Those with a new car franchise have
been having “a good time”; those dealing
in used cars only say their trade ranges
from “bad,” to “average” to “excellent.”
One with a new Chrysler-range fran-
chise is Felix Scaliery, managing director
of Condamine Motors, who is ecstatic
about his new cars, but who finds that
some makes of used cars have dropped
their prices.
“The retail price of some makes now
is the equivalent of the wholesale price
of six months ago.” Supply of used cars
is a minor worry with Mr Scaliery with
trade-ins on new cars to sell. “I sell
about 22 used cars and about 30 new
cars a month.”
One without a new car franchise is
Mr B. A. Ruckley of Bruce Ruckley
Motors Pty Ltd, of Homebush in Sydney.
“The market is a vacuum,” he said,
“There are no buyers at the moment . . .
it defies explanation.
“Prices have been very high in the
last month but they’re starting to ease
off now.” Mr Ruckley depends on the
new car trade for his supply of used
cars which he marks up in price an
average of £B5 to £125. The cars in his
yard this week ranged in price from £6OO
to £2600.
Mr Ruckley said more people were
buying used cars than ever before. “I
suppose it’s because there are a lot more
used cars around at the moment. Some
people would rather buy a used car than
a new one because they think they are
getting better value. I know of some
people who buy used cars because they
think they are avoiding sales tax.”
He estimates his turnover of used cars
at about 50 a month.
Many used car dealers depend on
Sydney’s five main motor auction houses
for their supply of vehicles. At thrice-
weekly auctions about 90 p.c. of the
buyers are in the used car trade, says an
executive of Sydney Motor Auctions,
parent company of Auto Auctions Pty
Ltd, Debiens Motor Auctions, Pty Ltd,
University Motor Auctions Pty Ltd, and
Pacific Motor Auctions Pty Ltd.
The executive said the used car market,
from the auction houses’ point of view,
was “quite good at the moment.” “And
it will improve between now and Christ-
mas.” He said the used car market closely
followed the new car market sales for
the last few years. He said as more new
cars were sold, people would buy more
used cars. “Used cars run at about twdce
the rate of new cars.”
He added that 60 p.c. of the auctions’
supply of used cars came from new car
dealers who had accepted the
vehicles as trade-ins. The public
supplied the other 40 p.c.
Mr R. S. Edwards, of Parry’s
Car Sales Pty Ltd of Arncliffe,
says the used car market at pre-
sent is “difficult”. “It is very
hard to forecast from week to
week what is going to happen.
Weather plays a very important
part in our business. We depend
on good weekend weather for
our trade.
“A wet weekend or a very hot
one can really cut into the busi-
ness. But despite the bad
weather we've had recently our
figures are up. We’ve not had
a bad weekend for three
months.”
George Christey, of George
R. Christey Pty Ltd of Summer
Hill, says business is “slow,”
and prices are down. “The buy-
ing power of the public has re-
duced prices and the new
Holden has reduced prices by
as much as 12 p.c. 1 think the
slump is quite general in the trade.”
Manager of the second hand sports
car division of C. G. Phillips Pty Ltd,
Ron Phillips, says business is at its best
since the credit squeeze. “We have had
a record week.”
More people, according to most
dealers, are buying used cars on hire
purchase. One, Mr W. J. Farley, pro-
prietor of Jack’s Used Cars of Strathfield,
says about 80 p.c. of his sales are on
terms. “It's practically the same all along
Parramatta Road” (Sydney’s largest con-
centration of used car dealers).


“But business along Parramatta Road,”
says Mr Farley, “is not good. The
couple of hot Sundays we had recently
kept people away from the yards.”
His monthly turnover of 30 to 40 cars
goes mainly to the “average wage earner”.
Dealers seem reluctant to handle any-
thing older than six years. One reason is
the finance companies’ refusal to finance
cars built before 1953.
Mr B. A. Ruckley said he would not
buy or sell “anything older than a ’58.”
“On that the finance companies will
allow a quarter deposit. From ’57 to
’55 it’s one-third deposit and for ’54 and
’53 a half deposit. Under ’53 . . . no go.
The majority of them operate like that.
“It’s very easy to get a second hand
car provided you’ve got the minimum
deposit and the correct references,” Mr
Ruckley said.
York Motors, which, apart from its
used cars also has franchises for Rolls
Royce, Bentley, Mercedes-Benz, Stude-
baker, Peugeot and Toyota, says used car
prices are “fairly stable.”
Used car manager for York, Mr J. M
Hall, says that while prices are stable at
present, they should taper
off towards Christmas. “The
salesmen look forward to
Christmas for a break and
so do the public, and prices
just naturally fall off. The
best months in the used car
trade are January-February.
Like most other dealers,
Mr Hall finds “a good supply
of clean, quality cars is
hard to come by. Some are
just rusted rubbish,” he said.
“We turn over 80 to 90 used
cars a month here.
“On the cars priced from
£5OO to £BOO about 75 p.c.
of all purchases are made
on terms. In the £lOOO to
£2OOO bracket only about
30 p.c. use hire purchase.”
Mr Hall added the credit
squeeze in 1960 “dropped
prices well down. They have never
really lifted but they have firmed.”
Figures from the Commonwealth
Statistician show that Australians spend
about as much on used vehicles as they
do on new, indicating a larger volume
of sales in the used car field because of
the lower prices. The 1961-62 total
amount of new vehicles financed was
£88.156 million, while used vehicles
consumed £84.508 million. For 1962-63
the amount of new vehicles financed
totalled £105.4 million, while used cars
leaped ahead to £114.1 million. Latest
figures available show £22.6 million in
finance for new vehicles for July and
August, and £22.6 million for used
vehicles for the same months.
Used vehicle manager of Harden and
Johnston Ltd (which has a Chrysler
products franchise), Mr R. Burton, says
popular makes of used cars such as
Holden and Valiant are in short supply.
But people are not buying more used
cars. “They are waiting for new models
so sales are at about the same level as
they were last year.
“There is more finance available than
ever before for second hand cars. Every
finance house has a lot of money,” Mr
Burton added.
Used car manager for Hunt Bros
(Sales) Pty Ltd at Rockdale, John
Howard, says the market is “average”.
“While prices are down they are very
patchy. There is a lack of used cars on
the market. It could be a lot better than
it is.
“We should be selling a lot more used
cars because of the growth in the
population. We aren’t this year. Maybe
it's because finance companies are giving
used car dealers a rough trot. The re-
possession rate is well up.

“Some of the less reputable used car
dealers sell bombs which eventually
break down. So the owner, rather than
pay for repairs, leaves the payments
lapse so the car will be repossessed and
taken off his hands.
“Business is so bad at the moment I
don’t think it'll be too long before there’s
a queue of dealers at the Gap. July,
August, September were our boom
months. But things have been so bad
lately I think there’s a recession still on.”
Mr J. A. Forrest, of Parkview Auto
Market Pty Ltd, does not paint such a
gloomy picture. “In the last three months
we’ve been averaging sales of 60 a
month,” he said. “And the market is
very strong. Prices have gone up.”
A dealer in both used cars and com-
mercial vehicles, Mr J. W. Hocking, of
Hocking Motors Pty Ltd, Five Dock,
says the used car market is “strong but
the public is hes u ant.” He says prices
which fell slightly in July and August
have now stabilised. Mr Hocking, a
Volkswagen specialist, says he sells 40-50
units a month. “But trade is still patchy.
For instance I sold three units over the
weekend while the new car bloke near
me sold only two. And a little further
down Parramatta Road a very small
dealer sold six.”
Mr Hocking, too, finds about 80 p.c.
of his sales are on hire purchase. “I
don’t think it will go any higher than
that because there is a lot more cash
flying around.” He does not find the lack
of a new car franchise hampers his
business. “I can get all the vehicles I
want from the new car dealers. And
besides that I’m independent without a
new car franchise. The manufacturers
can’t force me to sell used cars at a
lower price. I’ve heard of some dealers
who have been forced to sell used
vehicles at a loss.
“Yes, I’d say the used car
market at the moment is
strong. It’s not quite as strong
as it could be but then the
spell of bad weather we’ve
had hasn’t helped. It’s not
quite as stable as it was the
same time last year but still
good. If we were really up
against it we’d all be putting
up a big whinge.”
The only way to sell used
vehicles, says Mr B. A.
Walsh, a manager of
Vaughan and Lane, is to
have them “meticulously re-
conditioned and processed.”
Mr Walsh said Vaughan
and Lane, at the Hurstville
yard he manages, sold about
40 used vehicles a month.
The good spell used car
dealers have been enjoying is “seasonal”.
Mr Walsh says used car prices have
stabilised a little since the liquidation
programme Holden undertook before the
introduction of its new model. Those
dealers with a new car franchise are
having a better time than those with-
out. “With a new car franchise you are
getting more vehicles because of trade-
ins”.
The used car dealers do not seem
quite as confident as the new car dealers
who appeared in last week’s Bulletin,
but their market seems just as strong.
It is fairly clear, though, that those
who are fortunate enough to be able to
mix used and new lines are coping
best with the variable conditions which
apparently rule the market.


MARKET POINTERS
Gift Horse from AWA
A handout of some sort was expected
from AMALGAMATED WIRE-
LESS (AUSTRALASIA) LTD to mark
its 50th anniversary. Buyers of the shares
were saying this more than a year ago
when they bought in anticipation of the
50th birthday present.
Whether they received what they ex-
pected, in the form of an extra 2 p.c.
dividend, is difficult to say.
At one stage this year, however, the
ss. shares touched 255. compared with
a high-low price range in 1962 of
225. 9d. and 18s. 6d. So those who
bought early had the opportunity to get
out at a profit.
Current market of around 225. 9d.
only matches the 1962 peak, which
means that those who paid 255. earlier
this year are not doing so well. There
is one consolation. The company has
won some very nice contracts and it still
retains a powerful position in the elec-
tronics field. So those who are disap-
pointed that the company did not make
a bonus share issue should not be too
disgusted. AWA is one of those shares
that brokers keep on recommending. It
should not prove too much of a burden
for long-term holding.

Tt’s amazing how the sharemarket tends
to inflate shares of low par value.
LAN RAY INDUSTRIES Is. shares have
been selling at double par value, 25.,
despite a fall from £88,281 to £,6353
in profit.
Latest report from the company in-
dicates that annual dividend rate will be
raised from 12\ p.c. to 15 p.c. . . . be-
cause the September stocktake showed
an improved profit margin for the first
quarter of the current financial year.
As a result, the dividend will take
£32,677, or £26,324 more than the net
profit. The interim dividend of 6\
p.c. was paid on 2s. shares before they
were halved to Is. The final dividend of
7i p.c. is paid on Is. par value shares,
making 731 p.c. for the year to June.
In similar circumstances, if the shares
were ss. or 20s. par value, it is unlikely
the market would pay double the face
value. But, of course, Lanray shares
have been very tightly held in the past.
★ ■ ★ ★
H/| arrickville Holdings shares have
languished at the 21s. level even
after publication of what appears to be
a reasonably good annual report.
Stockholders would have been hap-
pier with the result if capital had not
been inflated by the takeover of Olympic
Bowling Centres, which had not been
completed at balance date and was in-
cluded under outside shareholders’ in-
terests of £.316,746.
The market treated this as a rescue
operation because the company already
was heavily involved in Brunswick Bowl-
ing Equipment Pty Ltd (now known as
Blacklock Industries Pty Ltd).
Marrickville’s past record has been so
good and its market rating so high that
it is difficult to dismiss the company
as a casualty of over-diversification.
But the market evidently insists that
a better yield should be demanded than
yesteryear.
This is one stock which has not shot
ahead in the all-time market boom of
this year. The ss. shares were up to
30s. 3d. in 1962, so today’s level is a
decent setback in anyone’s language.

Yrg Paper Pty Ltd, paper importing
offshoot of Van Reekum Gepacy
NV, Holland (listed on .the Amsterdam
Stock Exchange) plans to expand its
selling activities in Australia and recently
opened a new warehouse at Lakemba,
NSW, to handle newsprint, offset paper,
art paper, bond paper, wrapping paper,
paper board and printing machinery.
Obviously it will be a competitor of
APM, which dominates the wrapping
paper and paper board business in Aus-
tralia. Also it will compete with Asso-
ciated Pulp, which handles fine papers.
It also will compete in the self-ad-
hesive paper field, so evidently Australia
is regarded as a worth-while market,
despite the recent tariff protection gained
by APM.
indicated import figures of around
30,000 to 35,000 tons a year in cate-
gories comparable with APM apparently
do not represent a big threat at this
stage, because APM has achieved pro-
duction economies since it was able to
raise sales to around 331,000 tons per
annum.
Reports of rising sales by APM lifted
the market for the 20s. shares to around
31s. to yield 5.4 p.c. If the trend con-
tinues, the shares will go higher. But
shareholders are still remembering the
slump in APM shares when imports
managed to beat the tariff barrier.

interim report from KELVINA-
A TOR AUSTRALIA LTD, South
Australian maker of refrigerators and
domestic appliances, is of more than
passing interest to the trade, beset as it
is by intense competition and falling
production.
Directors say that sales and profits
have been maintained. This is in contrast
to the fall in Australian production of
refrigerators for the September quarter
and suggests that Kelvinator may be
increasing still further its share of the
refrigerator market, a trend already re-
ported last June.
The market has expressed its apprecia-
tion for the ss. shares by pushing them
to around 21s. 6d. compared with this
year’s low of 17s. Yield is just under
3.5 p.c. and, while recognising a good
performance in a fierce trade, it may be
prudent to remember that the yield is
derived from a relatively high 15 p.c.
dividend.
★ ★ ★
After a 30 p.c. drop in profit last year,
CONSOLIDATED QUARRIES
LTD of Melbourne reports that group
sales and profits in the quarter to Sep-
tember were much higher than those of
the corresponding period for 1962.
Directors indicate that the absorption
of Willis Quarries Pty Ltd was going
ahead and benefits would progressively
materialise.
Shareholders in the quarries group of
investments may take heart. Quarries
were tres chic a while back and high
prices were paid to be in the fashion.
Recovery in the building and construc-
tion trades should create extra demand
and, at prices below 13s. for Consoli-
dated Quarries ss. par value shares,
market yield is nudging 5 p.c.
Albion Quarries, at 125., to yield 4.2
p.c., is more popular in the Melbourne
list and, in any revival of interest, both
shares could move ahead.
★ ★ ★
Industrial laminates maker W. J.
MANUFACTURING CO. LTD
expects to maintain a 10 p.c. dividend on
capital recently increased by a one-for-
four issue.
The issue, made at a premium of 3s.
for each 10s. share, was required for
“further development and consolidation”
of activities in the Brookvale area. New
shares are payable in full on application
by December 2 and rank for dividend
from January 1 next year.
★ ★ ★
After a narrow squeak in 1961-62,
when earnings gave little margin
for the 10 p.c. dividend, construction
equipment engineer TUTT BRYANT
LTD has pulled out of the mire.
Latest year to June 30 produced profit
of £207,854, to show 14.0 p.c. on capital.
The tax was light at £38,237 because
of the low incidence of tax on New
Guinea income and because dividends
were received from jointly owned com-
panies which were not consolidated.
At present the ss. shares are selling
around 7s. lid., 2s. below this year’s
peak. It is essentially a cyclical stock.
One could fairly assume Tutt Bryant is
now on the upswing.

OIL CORNER
More Tantalising “Shows”
initial small flow of oil at 6283 ft.
in Union-Kern-AOG’s Wunger No.
1 well, 70 miles west of the Moonie
field in Queensland, although described
as non-commercial is at least en-
couraging.
It occurred on the western side of
the Surat Basin in the same type of sand
as the oil sands uncovered at Richmond
by the “Associated” group. (The small
recovery of 10 barrels a day is not in
the same oil sands as located at Moonie,
it is understood.)
However, Union-Kern-AOG advises
that the sands at Wunger, Moonie and
Richmond are on three separate horizons.
These tantalising “shows” help to re-
vive flagging spirits but the costly dril-
ling programme needs something more
substantial by way of a commercial flow.
Interest of speculators is sustained
once more in AOG and the Associated
group after some disappointing drilling
results.
★ ★ ★
/Ane of the Union-Kern-AOG boys bet
” mea lottery ticket they would dis-
cover oil (outside Moonie) before
Christmas. He claimed it this week,
saying: “I didn’t stipulate if the oil would
be commercial or not.” I paid up. There
are still a few weeks to Christmas.
★ ★ ★
TAevelopment of the Sirte Basin in
Libya, about 200 miles inland from
the Mediterranean coast south of Ben-
ghazi, makes an interesting comparison
with Queensland’s oil search progress
because Moonie is a similar distance in-
land. Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso)
struck oil in the Libyan desert in 1958.
It was described as a “modest” flow of
17,500 barrels a day.
A year later and 1000 miles away,
Esso struck much richer flows at a field
called Zelten. Today, after spending
about £A4Om. in development over a
five-year period, Esso’s recently com-
pleted £6m. pipeline is carrying oil 200
miles to the coast at a rate of 13 million
tons per annum. Oasis Oil (operating
company for three US independents,
Amarada, Continental and Marathon)
also has a nearby pipeline which ships
out 10 million tons per annum.
Although the producing wells of Esso
and Oasis Oil are located only between
100 miles and 200 miles from the coast,
producers claim that the high cost of
getting it out to the coast (which re-
quired the building of a road as well as
a pipeline) demands a high rate of pro-
duction to make it a commercial propo-
sition. Included in the cost is about
£125,000 a day in royalties.
Esso’s pipeline was completed nearly
five years after the initial strike. The
Moonie pipeline was put down within
two years of the December, 1961, strike.
This appears to be an expression of
supreme confidence compared with the
Libyan experience.
★ ★ ★
A n oil man said recently that the ac-
cumulating evidence of oil explora-
tion in Australia indicated that more
offshore drilling would need to be under-
taken. He is convinced that the really
lucrative oil areas are offshore.
Unfortunately, offshore drilling is a
most expensive operation, but the tech-
niques now being developed are very
efficient.

Not Very Happy at Hams

best laid plans of mice and men
A so often go awry. This seems to

in its stable, R. W. Steane Ltd, the Vic-

(even to Adelaide to Devon Credits) for
£56,800 to meet the repayment on
the company’s 9 p.c. registered un-
secured debentures due on September
30 was by no means shared by the prin-
cipals of the House of Ham.
In fact that would be an understate-
ment of the position because, as The
Bulletin heard it from very close
quarters, several likely doors, including
one of the trading banks with possible
ready finance for Steane’s, were mys-
teriously closed flat in Mr Steane’s face.
Indeed with so many stern refusals
in Melbourne it was obvious that re-
course would again have to be made
interstate. So the word was passed along
to Mr Steane that his best bet was to
try one of the Sydney-based finance or
hire-purchase companies, a course which
has finally put an end to his worries
because Lombard (Australia), who would
be alert to the sound earnings capacity
of the company, has given him the
necessary nod.
Nor can it be said that, with Hams
so avid for the takeover by Neon Signs,
Mr Steane has only himself to blame
for being in the predicament. As we
stated in The Bulletin (September 28),
the company’s liquidity position has been
sadly in disrepair, obvious enough from
its failure to pay a final dividend despite
the previous 10 p.c. dividend rate being
covered by earnings in the year to
June 30.
The note redemption was a must for
September 30 and, in very good time
for this, the company had for some
while previously been attempting to ar-
range a new issue of £lOO,OOO 8i p.c.
registered unsecured convertible notes
with a five-year currency which would
have looked after it with something to
spare for other liquidity requirements.
Indeed, confident of being able to find
this money, the company actually an-
nounced the issue. The question must
now be asked, who upset the arrange-
ment?
We could make a good guess. It was
certainly nothing in the trading outlook
which caused backers to go cold on the
issue. Indeed, although Steane’s profits
fell back a bit last year, the move to
the new Glen Waverley factory would
account for that, while with £lOO,OOO
worth of Government orders on the
books and with repeats in prospect the
company looked all set for a much better
year this time.
Meanwhile, and let us face it squarely
because Melbourne’s stockbroking frat-

ernity are much disturbed about it, things
are very unhappy at Hams. Not only
is the principal very pre-occupied with
the affair of Garrisson Industries, of
which he is a director, but, as revealed
last week, the lights of Neon Signs, of
which, also, he is a director, have gone
dim at a time when, going on recent
statements by the company, one might
have expected them to be burning
brightly.
Going back a year it will be remem-
bered that the chairman was then gaily
optimistic on the prospects for maintain-
ing the 1961-62 earning rate of 27.13
p.c. on higher capital consequent on the
new two-for-five issue to shareholders
and the acquisition of Neon Corpora-
tion, Electrical Repair Co. and Erco
Sales, three Brisbane concerns, and V.
and R. D’esterre in Perth on what Mr
W. D. Sykes, the chairman, called favor-
able terms, together with four other com-
panies.
Expansion was to be the order of the
day, for not only were there these ac-
quisitions, but also internally the group
was branching out in several new direc-
tions the manufacture of switchgear
and cables, ballasts and choke gear and
materials for use in the group’s plants
and so on.
After nine months of last year, Mr
Sykes indicated that all seemed to be
going according to plan, saying that the
earnings rate for the full year would be
“within kicking distance” of the pre-
vious year’s, sales in all divisions were
reported to have set new records with an
increase of 114 p.c. and orders in hand
were 78 p.c. higher than in the corres-
ponding nine months of the previous
year.
Nobody took much notice of the chair-
man’s demurrer that the report did not
cover the results of two of the recently
acquired subsidiaries, though this was
the vital clue for shadows to come. In
April the interim dividend had duly been
maintained at the previous year’s rate
of 61 p.c.
Then, moving on six months to Sep-
tember, again the accent was on optim-
ism with an announcement of a million’s
worth of new contracts won. Though
there was no mention of earnings
achieved in the year to June, this was
sufficient to keep the company’s shares
in good market shape with a premium
of at one time 3s. lOd. on the ss. shares,
enough to serve nicely in a share ex-
change bid for R. W. Steane.
But shortly after gaining this premium
the shares suffered from persistent sel-
ling. In a matter of weeks the whole of
the premium had disappeared, the price
dropping to under par and seeming to be
heading towards the level of R. W.
Steane’s, which despite its debenture de-
fault had recovered on prospects of a
takeover bid from Neon! Questioned
about the drop in Neon’s shares, Mr
Sykes could only say that it was in line
with the general market weakness and
also with the rumors about what the
company’s results for 1962-63 might be.
He might have added that people in
the know about the results, not merely
the rumors, could have been responsible
for some of the selling because the worst
fears were realised. The final dividend
was passed and directors stated that the
group results would be affected by sub-
stantial losses from two recently ac-
quired subsidiaries (presumably the two
referred to in the March statement) dis-
covered in the pre-acquisition audited
balance sheets and that profit for the
year would be marginal at best.
Mr Sykes seemed to indicate that the
existence of profits would depend on the
“implication of tax payments.” It is
understood that the belatedly discovered
losses arose from certain pre-acquisition
selling expenses in the two subsidiaries.
At this stage it would probably be
advisable to wait until the full accounts
are published before making further
comment, except to say that despite the
revelation of losses the directors regard
trading thus far in the current year as
highly satisfactory and are viewing the
future with confidence.
Leroy in the Clouds
11/omen’s fashion firm Leroy Manu-
" facturing, based in Victoria, is a
mass of contradictions investment-wise.
Last year its profit dropped from
£17,934 to a mere shadow, £2,499,
which of course didn’t anywhere near
cover the steady 10 p.c. payment for
the year. But the directors continue to
tease the shareholders with talk of ex-
pansion when the time is right, con-
sideration of plans for diversification,
and high prospects for the development
of the far away New Zealand business.
Pardon us, but all this romancing
looks like pie in the sky against such a
dismal profit background. True, the
company has bought a third interest in
a small office equipment firm (are they
going to jump on the decimal conversion
bandwagon, too!), and two “pilot”
factories have been set up to make up
garments after styling. But investors
will want to see more evidence of a profit
recovery before taking such moves very
seriously.

TTanimex Corporation Ltd, photo-

pansive mood, raising more than
£250,000 by a private placement of
shares and notes.
Of this, £200,000 is being raised by
7i p.c. notes maturing in 12 years. The
balance is from placement of 100,000
ss. shares at a “substantial premium.”
London listing will be sought for the
shares. At present 10.11 p.c. of the

are held in the UK. The company does
substantial business in that country.

take up ss. stock units at 9s. between
February 22, 1967, and February 21,

The company incurred a substantial
loss in 1957-58 and was missing from
the dividend lists for three years there-
after.
Investors should keep this in mind
before being carried away by the com-
pany’s current high earning rate. The
shares have been run up to over 145.,

met last week to take stock of the
position after the chairman told the
annual meeting that even with Govern-
ment aid, which had been sought to
concentrate production in two establish-
ments, there was only a remote possi-
bility of carrying on.
Following the 1961-62 loss of
£109,000, which put the carry forward
in debit of £56,944, the company had a
further loss of £93,934, of which about
half was for stock write-offs, last year.
In any winding up, the chairman said
that return to shareholders would
depend on the realisation of stock on
hand which, in any event, “would be
extremely low”.

Sales and other revenue increased by
7.66 p.c., profit by 9 p.c. to £2,573,000

momentous task of raising £2l million
for the Brisbane refinery, Ampol set
about arranging a term advance for
£8,334,000 from a consortium of Aus-
tralian banks, a long-term loan of £5
million from leading financial institutions,
and a deferred share issue for £7.8
million from ordinary shareholders and
noteholders.
Additionally, Ampol issued £2.5
million of registered unsecured notes to
finance extra service stations, the Kurnell
lubricating refinery and for general work-
ing capital.
Maintenance of earning rate, giving
tight cover for the usual 14 p.c. dividend,
was forecast by directors earlier in the
year.
The market has reaffirmed faith in
Ampol by pushing the ss. ordinary shares
up to a peak 11s. Bd. At the present
price a few pence lower, the shares yield
6.1 p.c. They had retreated to Bs. 6d. in
May, prior to the deferred issue.
Playing it Cool
“Tt is an ill wind that blows nobody
A any good,” said Mr Christensen at
the Peters (Vic.) meeting, “and for that
reason the executives of the ice cream
division were justifiably perhaps some-
what jealous of the pastry foods division
where the executives found themselves
having a very good time last year.”
What with the rotten weather and
being caught in mid-summer stream
with a new and an old factory sharing
the burden of production with neither
flat out, the ice-cream boys were
obviously playing it cool while the ovens
in the pastry division were apparently
running white hot catering for record
demand.
Talking about the group’s broad acres
—2,800 of them —serving its Bird’s Eye,
Edgells and Hi-Peak brands, the chair-
man said that 1,000 acres had been
acquired last year and 100 acres of this
was already under crop.
On the other hand the group disposed
of some of the poorly situated and un-
economic dairy factories originally be-
longing to the Holdenson and Neilson
group and this resulted in higher profits
in that division with higher budgeted-
for figures in the current year.
But pride of place goes to the export
division, which increased its turnover
by 44 per cent last year and is going for
a further increase of 75 per cent in the
current year (so far this has been ex-
ceeded, sales being 90 per cent up on
the same period last year.)
Finally Mr Christensen gave a “hands
off” warning to possible overseas bidders
for the group. “We don’t want to find
Australia in the same position of dom-
ination by overseas capital as Canada”,
he said. “It is our ardent hope that we
shall remain a truly Australian-owned
company with profits earned therefrom
being distributed within Australia where
they rightly belong.”
Another Financier Sees Red
Tust three years after public placement
** for listing purposes, Anglo Pacific
Securities Ltd has crashed into the red
to the extent of £93,701.
The company got off the ground with
a profit of £36,188 equal to 14.3 p.c.
on capital in 1960-61, but the next year
it had slipped to £1865. Directors re-
ported in 1961-62 that only the elec-
trical retailing subsidiary was unprofit-
able.
Provision of £41,649 for doubtful
debts as well as £28,413 written off as
bad debts, plus stock write-downs of
£9766, contributed to the present loss.
Anglo Pacific was formed in 1959 to

ment companies operating on Sydney’s

purchase contracts and secured loans of
seven other finance organisations.
Directors expected to pay dividends
of 10 p.c. which only eventuated in the
first year. In the second an interim 5 p.c.
was paid; this year, nothing.
A market deterioration in trading for
the second half of the year gives little
ground for optimism.
The ss. shares sold at 2s. just prior
to the news, but dropped heavily on
quote the next day.
Quarterly Example
Tt is pleasing to see the succession of
A quarterly reports from Beneficial
Finance Corporation Ltd. More com-
panies should follow the example of
giving a running commentary on pro-
gress throughout the year.
Beneficial directors announce the com-
pany’s outstandings for the half year to
September 30 at £6,653,877 —an in-
crease of £1,105,368, or 20 p.c. over
the previous year’s figure. They represent
an increase of 46 p.c. or £2,122,755 over
the corresponding period of the last
financial year.
The company is paying an interim
dividend of 4 p.c. on November 20.
Ira Berk’s Fordg
TTaving dropped the Sydney Rootes
dealership on February 1, 1963, Ira
L. and A. C. Berk (Holdings) Ltd has
arranged a Ford dealership for the
Maroubra district.
Directors are convinced a good sales
and service potential exists in Randwick,
Waverley and Woollahra. Although the
new activities will probably not com-
mence until half-way through 1963-64,
directors hope to report good progress
at the annual meeting next year.
The finance subsidiary has had bad
debts and heavy repossessions, but should
do better when the Ford business begins.
In Queensland the Nissan - Datsun
business appears entirely satisfactory,
and the Cedric model has met with
ready acceptance.
The company is nicely liquid, with
£56,491 in the bank (compared with
last year’s overdraft of £43,727) and
£55,000 in interest-bearing deposits.
Announcement of the Ford dealership
did little to boost the ss. shares, which
continued to be quoted on either side of
3s.
Lower Interest Attracts
'C'lectrical engineer Lawrence and
Hanson is to raise additional funds
with a share issue at par and a private
placement of unsecured notes. The final
payment on an issue the company made
in 1959 is not due until early next month.
Shareholders and convertible note
holders will be able to apply for one new
share for every six they hold. First pay-
ment of ss. falls due by March 1 next
year, and the final payment will not be
due before September 1 next year. The
shares will rank for dividend on the
amount paid as from March 1 next year.
Directors say the company is making
the private placement “to take advantage
of the lower interest rates at present pre-
vailing in the market.” It will issue
200,000 unsecured notes of 10s. each.
When fully-paid the one-for-six issue
will lift paid capital to £603,875.
Directors say they are confident the
company will be able to maintain the
10 p.c. dividend on the increased capital.
lan Potter and Co. and E. L. and C.
Baillieu will underwrite the issue.
Competition during the first three
months of the current year “has re-
mained keen.” But sales have exceeded
those for the previous corresponding
period. The Darwin branch has reported
satisfactory sales and a branch was
opened in Canberra earlier last month
(October).
At a cum rights price of around 17s.
6d., a purchase of the shares would
average down to about 16s. 5d., but the
new shares, being partly paid for a long
time, will probably be cheaper than their
theoretical price.
Bursting at the Seams
T>uoyancy in the building trade is
rubbing off very pleasingly on the
two big Melbourne constructionists
A. V. Jennings and its more recently
established rival Leighton Contractors,
whose promising career on ’Change has
seen rapid promotion to the main trading
room and the achievement of an assured
high investment status albeit its dividend
yield of 5.3 being about 1 p.c. higher
than Jennings’.
In pointing the increase from 23.6 to
24.9 p.c. in earnings to cover the steady
10 p.c. dividend on higher capital last
year, Mr S. E. Leighton, the chairman,
said at the meeting in Melbourne last
week that the result was all the more
pleasing in that the industry had had a
tough time last year. That makes this
year’s rising turnover all the more hope-
ful for dividends. He said the company
has £4 million worth of work in hand
with expansion in WA and Canberra.
In Victoria things were busier than for
some time.
Mr A. V. Jennings was rather more
specific at his company’s meeting on the
same day, saying that in the first three
months of the current year turnover
had increased by a quarter and profit
margins had been maintained. Turnover
last year was £12.6 million, which gave
rise to an increase from £195,611 to
£281,419 in profit.
Current work on hand was valued
at £12.8 million, of which contracts
gained in the first three months of the
year represented about one-third. One
notable contract was for building a
£700,000 wool store in Brisbane, and
this will also mean the establishment of
a Jennings office there thus completing,


says the chairman, “the national charac-
ter of the company”.
And as the company is bursting the
seams at its Burwood headquarters in
Victoria it is going to shift out to Spring-
vale where it will have room to breathe.
Agricultural Revival
A gricultural and general engineers
Horwood Bagshaw Ltd, of Ade-
laide, made a quick recovery from
1961-62 difficulties of higher costs re-
ducing margins.
The 1962-63 profit of £104,344
would have been a record but for
£37,329 written off for research and
development.
An anniversary bonus of 2i p.c. is
being paid to ordinary shareholders over
and above basic dividend, which was
raised from 8£ p.c. to 9i p.c. The full
distribution for the latest June year is
therefore Ilf p.c.
Improved liquidity has urged directors
to offer redemption of 275,000 20s.
8 p.c. notes which were to be converted
to shares at part on June 30, 1964. Note-
holders are offered Bs. cash premium,
which is approximately equal to the
premium the market now shows on the
ss. shares, plus interest of 9.6 d.
Turner’s Troubles
"TVjrther to our dirge on Turner In-
dustries last week, the chairman
said at the meeting a few days ago that
the company’s appliances division suf-
fered losses of £78,000 last year and
that overall directors were disappointed
at the poor start to business in the first
three months of the current year.
Though steps have been taken to stop
the leak in the appliances section, by the
tenor of his remarks the chairman didn’t
seem too confident of their success to
date. From what he said there is still
a big task ahead to reduce surplus stocks.
Recovery Road?
T>ayment of ordinary as well as pre-
ference dividends for three unprofit-
able years shows tenacity in the face of
adversity. This is the position with Mel-
bourne chemical manufacturers Sulphates
Ltd.
Latest trading result for the year to
June 30 was a group loss of £12,835,
after providing £23,828 for depreciation
and £17,250 for tax.
The parent company made a profit
which was wiped out, apparently, by
losses of the principal subsidiary Filtra-
tion and Water Softening Pty Ltd, which
was the source of difficulties in the two
previous years.
This company designs, manufactures
and constructs water treatment and
sewerage treatment plants. Financial
stringency since late 1960 has affected
Government and semi-Government pro-
jects severely, so competition for the
available business was intensified.
It is understood that Filtration and
Water Softening Pty Ltd received more
orders in one week recently than for the
whole of the previous year.
On the basis of this information a
purchase of the 20s. shares at around
14s. 6d. has definite speculative appeal.
Glazier Cracks
Tn the 17 years it has been public Frank
G. O'Brien Ltd had not missed a
dividend until 1962-63 brought trading
difficulties.
The glass and shopfitting division in
particular suffered. Although a loss of
£23,000 was incurred in the first half it
was wiped out in the second, to give an
overall result of £2883 profit.
Trade information was that several
cuts in glass prices would affect glass
merchants’ profits.
O’Brien does not, in its preliminary
profit statement, offer much explanation
or comfort to shareholders, although
directors say tentatively that trading con-
ditions are now more satisfactory and
the current outlook is brighter.
Townson Near Peak
its sixth successive profit rise,
"* Townson and Mercer Holdings
(Aust.) Ltd has confirmed a dividend of
13i p.c. From £37,739 in 1958 profit
has grown to £70,494 in the last year.
For 1962-63 it improved £3474, or
5.2 p.c. to return a record. The chemicals
and scientific instruments distributor
earned 25.6 p.c. on capital compared
with 25 p.c. on average capital for the
previous year. Tax rose £503 to £47,047
and depreciation £493 to £3842.
The ss. shares, at present selling at
19s. 6d., yield 3.5 p.c. They are just
below their 1963 peak.
Optimistic Options
A fter four successive years of losses
Tulloch Limited, heavy engineer,
hopes to show “a moderate level of profit-
ability” in the second half of the current
year. Directors say they expect a still
more satisfactory profit level in the 1965
year.
In the year to June 30, the company
incurred a loss of £24,322 and again
failed to pay an ordinary dividend. The
last dividend paid was 1\ p.c. for 1959-
60 before a loss of £290,915.
Now, say directors in the annual re-
port, the company expects better results.
The year was “one of great challenge
during which the company was re-
financed and the foundations laid for its
future development.”
The first of the 120 double-deck rail-
way carriages ordered in a £3.3 million
NSW Railways Dept contract will be
delivered early next year.
Tonnage output of the group's foundry
was slightly higher than in the previous
year. The Econo products division, which
manufactures prefabricated buildings of
both aluminium and steel, showed a de-
cline in sales volume during the year.
However, demand has increased in
recent months.
The ss. shares are still hanging around
par, while options to take up the shares
during September, 1967, are traded at
an optimistic Is. Bd.
Clyde’s Second-best Year
HPrading in the 12 months to June 30,
1963, produced the second-best
result ever for Clyde Industries Ltd.
Profit of £716,807 compares with
£555,100 in the previous year, after
making lower provisions for tax and
depreciation. The earning rate stepped
up from 14.7 to 19.2 p.c., clearing the
usual 15 p.c. dividend this time with
ease.
Clyde must have been one of the
most dismayed spectators at Concrete
Industries’ share price decline.
In January of this year Clyde sold
Fowler Road Constructions and Fowler
Asphalt to Concrete for the exchange
of 650,000 Concrete ss. shares at a
premium of 6s. By balance date these
had tumbled to 7s. 2d., partly account-
ing for the difference between market
value of listed investments £815,925 and
book value £1,245,420.
Since June 30, Concrete shares have
pulled up to Bs. 3d.
Clyde directors said operations were
satisfactory in 1962-63 except for two
subsidiaries which incurred small losses.
They pointed out that although Clyde
began in heavy engineering, it now
represents less than one-eighth of the
total business.
Indications are favorable for 1963-64
trading, sales and profits for the first
quarter being in excess of the corres-
ponding period last year.
The ss. Clyde shares are now hovering
round the 10s. mark, compared with a
high of 12s. Id. earlier this year.
lAC and Bebarfalds

falds’ directors are on lAC’s board.

falds Ltd, Mr L. Newton, is also on the

SECURITY ANALYSIS
“My Favorite Stock for
Growth with Stability”
W. R. Carpenter’s Remarkable Record
By ROGER RANDERSON
An air of expectancy is created by
the most recent splendid accounts
of W. R. Carpenter Holdings Ltd,
and the market for its stock units is
strong with anticipation as the com-
pany’s annual general meeting at Can-
berra on November 22 draws near.
There is scarcely ever a dull year for
this remarkably progressive company.
Already shareholders have been
advised that they will receive 10 p.c.
as their final dividend payment for
1962-63, which increases total of dis-
tributions for the year by 2+ to 17i p.c.
However, it is almost 50 years since
Sir Walter Carpenter started the business
with a capital of only £lOOO, so that
a more impressive memento is being
expected to mark the important annivers-
ary in the current trading year.
Will this further benefit be made
known at the coming meeting, or will
shareholders hear of further investments
and plans for diversification, being left
in suspense a little longer?
Frankly, I do not know, although the
omens seem propitious.
W. R. Carpenter can lay claim to
being one of the most reliable growth
stocks on Australian stock exchanges.
Earning power and reserves have once
again been built up to a point where a
bonus issue could be comfortably made,
although a one-for-one bonus issue was
made in 1950-51, followed by a further
one-for-one bonus issue in 1957-58.
A seven-year cycle for bonus issues,
without impairment of stability, is most
difficult to achieve. It is obviously the
result of sagacious investment and re-
sourceful management in highly profit-
able fields.
Accounts for the year ended Sep-
tember 30 show that the group increased
its earnings by 22 p.c. to £1,744,744.
This was 36.7 p.c. of the average capital
used during the year (£4,750,000). And
it represents 7.8 p.c. of shareholders’
funds at the end of the period.
Depreciation and amortisation amount-
ing to £1,050,572 Cup £80,139) was
charged, and £803,015 (up £67,617) was
provided for income tax, before arriving
at the year’s profit.
The directors really can be believed
when they state, as usual, that “the assets
of the company would realise the value
at which they are shown in the books”.
Only the net value of assets after de-
ducting amounts provided for deprecia-
tion, amortisation, bad debts and price
fluctuation is given in the table opposite.
Such provisions, however, totalled
£4,054,330 on September 30.
In addition, the company’s massive
reserves totalling £17,262,578 include
£1,907,411 of specific reserves to cover
contingencies for Pacific Island sub-
sidiaries.
Policy has been directed for some time
towards building up investments and
earnings on the mainland, with a view
to steadying the effects of price falls in
tropical products, and as a safeguard
against loss from political hazards.
Already impressive results are seen in
the fact that almost 51 p.c. of earnings
more than sufficient to cover the
dividend —is derived from Australian
sources.
Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to
discount unduly the riches that are yet
to be won in the South Pacific —from
coconut and cacao plantations, beer and
cement making. While shipping is far
from rewarding, it nevertheless will con-
tinue to play an important auxiliary role.
We should remember that the United
States now virtually guarantees our
New Guinea frontier, and that World
Bank loans may soon be spent there on
development. The company has the
prospect of expanding markets as living
standards of the islanders in New
Guinea as well as Fiji are rapidly
rising.
W. R. Carpenter in the current year
should be earning far more in Fiji
because of the recent phenomenal rise
in sugar prices, while the upward
tendency in world prices for other com-
modities should benefit earnings gener-
ally.
Aggregation of results from many
diverse activities in the accounts makes
it difficult to assess how much W. R.
Carpenter has gained from the acquisi-
tion of Claude Neon by a share exchange
in 1961-62.
Receivables, representing earnings to
come in the future from rental contracts
for signs and lighting, increased by
£451,939 to £7,996,874 during the past
year. These are conservatively omitted
from assets, although the company treats
the 59th and 60th rent instalments (this
year totalling £309,953) as a liability.
The past year’s installations were
capitalised at factory cost at £751,513,
against which £68,028 was provided for
amortisation.
In view of revenues to be derived in
future years from almost £8 million of
“unmatured rentals”, it is the acme of
conservatism to show the net valuation
of the asset from which they are
derived at £1,535,543, including an
increase of only £42,035 for the past
year.
No less than £599,190 was provided

It would be interesting to know what
progress is being made with the produc-
tion of transformers and other electrical
products.
However, the predominant feature of
W.. R. Carpenter’s past year has been
its investment operations.
It was a surprise to shareholders
generally, and perhaps a disappointment
to some, that the company took the un-
usual course of asking them to subscribe
to a one-for-four issue at 12s. 6d., and
placed further shares at a premium.
The purpose was to finance the purchase
of 5,000,000 shares in Woolworths and
the taking up of rights to a further
1,000,000.
One or two critics pointed to the com-
pany’s strong cash position and even
doubted whether the issue was necessary
for the purpose. Cash requirements,
however, were well judged, as the
accounts show.
It is now possible to trace some of the
directors’ moves in the accounts. Splen-
did benefits are already showing to
justify confidence in the eventual fruits.
It appears that additions to the port-
folio cost £4,896,325, but were offset by
realisations amounting to £425,000,
giving a net outlay of £4,471,325. As
against this, the market value of listed
investments increased by £5,682,666.
So a book profit of £1,211,341
appears as the result of the year’s
transactions. This increased the surplus
of market value over cost for listed
securities to £3,025,273 at balancing
date.
Without doubt the acquisition of a
6,000,000 block of Woolworths shares
almost entirely accounted for the year’s
accretion in the portfolio.
Income from investments increased by
£56,957 to £432,574, but it appears to
have included only the final dividend for
1962-63 from the Woolworths’ acquisi-
tion, so that it will be increased at least
by that company’s interim dividend in
the current year.
W. R. Carpenter has the controlling
interest in Southern Pacific Insurance,
whose figures as a subsidiary are in-
cluded in the consolidated accounts, sub-
ject to the deduction from shareholders’
tunds for the large outside shareholdings.
The company’s other substantial share
interests include large holdings in
Ansett, Associated Securities, Burns
Philp, CAGA and Dalton Bros Hold-
ings.
Earnings yield for such a large in-
vestment company tends to be under-
stated by the share of profits reserved
by the companies in which it is interested.
But it is quite satisfactory as shown
around 5 p.c.
It is not surprising in these circum-
stances that the ss. stock unit is stand-
ing at a high premium—more than seven
times par value.
At this point I should warn readers
that I have been a firm holder of a few
of these shares for some time, so that
they can make full allowance for any
unintended bias in my remarks.
For a combination of growth with
stability this is my favorite stock at
present prices.
An amount of about 365. buys net
tangible assets valued quite conserva-
tively at 255. 3d., even when listed in-
vestments are included at market value.
This allows nothing for extremely
valuable patents and trade marks which
are all but £40,457 written off.
It means that a purchaser pays
275. 9d. in the £ for his share of the
company’s assets.
And goodwill is acquired for only
about six years’ purchase of stated earn-
ings.
Ignoring the bonus element in any
expected issue, an immediate dividend
yield of £2 15s. 6d. a year from each
£lOO invested is available, on the reason-
able assumption that the final distribu-
tion points to a 20 p.c. annual dividend.
The price to which the share might
go on the announcement of a bonus
issue, and the ex-rights price at which it
might settle after such an issue, depend
on the subsequent dividend rate.
The present surplus of earnings over
dividend payments, with even better
prospects in the coming year, is some
assurance against too drastic a cut in
the dividend rate on an increased
number of shares.
The Bulletin in the past has been
properly scathing as to the growing
tendency for companies to make what
it called “Irishman’s bonus issues”.


TOOHEYS LIMITED
Address by the Chairman, the Hon. R. C. Wilson, C.M.G.,
at the Annual General Meeting on October 30, 1963
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Directors’ Report and the
Annual Accounts are compre-
hensive documents and set out
the Company’s position clearly.
I know you have read them. Be-
fore formally moving the motion
for their adoption, I would like
to make a few comments.
First of all, I know that you
are all pleased that the re-
organisation undertaken last
year has been so successful. The
increased eciciency in our brew-
ing, distribution and account-
ing methods, plus our greater
volume of sales, have resulted
in a 57% increase in profits and
I am glad to say that the im-
provement is still continuing
this year.
In comparing the figures for
income tax shown for this year
and last year, I would point out
again that the tax for both years
has been reduced by the pre-
acquisition losses at Grafton.
These have now been fully re-
couped. In this year’s Profit and
Loss Account we have shown the
full tax and then deducted the
amount saved on account of
Grafton. This, I think, gives you
a clear picture now and a clear
comparison for future years.
Now, turning to our business
of brewing, we are all very proud
of the beer we are producing. It
is a good beer and its sale is
increasing all the time.
The layout of the' bottling and
canning lines at Auburn Brew-
ery has been improved and our
canning capacity has been in-
creased.
Our Brewery at Grafton is
proving very successful. Pro-
duction and sales are continuing
to increase and profits are satis-
factory.
Since the last Annual Meet-
ing, we have completed the pur-
chase of Terry Street from the
City Council. Terry Street ran
right through the centre of our
Standard Brewery. Gordon
House is now demolished and
the area will allow us room for
further development.
Due to our increased sales of
beer, it has been necessary to
acquire more steel casks and
these are costly, especially when
you realise we must use them in
triplicate that is, one going
out, one in the hotel and one
coming back. That is why it is
necessary for our hotelkeepers
and Company representatives to
assist us in every way in keeping
these casks moving.
Of course, whilst we are
making improvements to meet
changes and to make ourselves
more efficient and, I think I
may say, doing it well —we must
also point out that costs are still
rising.
The Valuer General has placed
higher values on many of our
properties and this has in-
creased our rates and taxes
materially. Licence fees have
also increased. Wages are rising.
We have many fine properties
of which we are justly proud.
But we are living in a changing
world and change is expensive.
In some country districts es-
pecially, where hotels once paid
their way by supplying food,
drink and accommodation for
travellers, they now face strong-
er competition from motels and
clubs.
We welcome competition and
we supply Tooheys beer to many
clubs, but to compete success-
fully we must continually mod-
ernise our hotels. Where this is
not economically possible, we
must face some rationalisation.
An an instance of change of
thought in hotels, I refer you to
our new Antler Parkway Hotel-
Motel, built in French’s Forest
on the way to the northern
metropolitan beaches. It is built
on modern lines with wide open
spaces around it which are so
important to take care of car
parking problems.
And as an instance of new
thinking in the alteration of
hotels, take for example our
Royal Narrabeen Hotel, which
we are modernising at the pre-
sent time. We are doing this by
building big structures which
will stand the ravages of time,
but their internal arrangements
are more or less prefabricated so
that they can be moved or
changed around to meet the
changing fashions without in-
terfering in any way with the
main building.
As regards Toohey’s Standard
Securities Limited, this Com-
pany was formed in 1929 during
the Depression years. Its object
was to raise money to lend to
Tooheys Limited. It achieved its
objective very well at the time,
but it was cumbersome and ex-
pensive. Your Directors felt that
finance could be arranged else-
where and that it would be
cheaper and more flexible. We
therefore repaid the debt to
Tooheys Standard Securities
Limited. I should say here, that
we are very grateful to our
Bankers, The Commercial Bank-
ing Company of Sydney Limited,
for their ready assistance to us
in this matter.
Finally, I should say one word
about the reduced dividend. I
can assure you that this was not
done without much earnest con-
sideration by your Directors. We
earned enough profit to continue
paying the 9% dividend but we
must look to the future. It was
in all our interests that Tooheys
should be strengthened finan-
cially, that we should have
money to meet the changes as
they come along, and to keep
ourselves abreast of the times.
Although we are much smaller
than our chief competitor in
this State, we are still a big
brewery. We are, in fact, the
third largest in Australia. We
make splendid beer which we
produce and sell at a lower price
than beer is sold in any other
State of the Commonwealth.
Had we sold our beer on the
terms which operate in Victoria,
which is the next lowest in
price, we would have increased
our profit by approximately
£350,000 tax paid.
During the year our staff has
done a magnificent job. They
have worked as a splendid team
and our thanks are due to them
for the results they have
achieved.
We look forward to the future
with confidence.
I now have pleasure in
moving:
that the Report and Balance
Sheet as presented be
adopted;
that the payment of In-
terim Dividend on April
30 last be confirmed;
that the Final Dividend as
recommended be declared.
R. C. WILSON


Two Questions on Drug Houses
By “ANALYST”
At the beginning of the current fiscal
year, Drug Houses of Australia
ordinary shares were selling around 755.
This was only slightly below the highest
price over the last five years of 775. Bd.
Yet a few weeks ago, sales took place
at 545. 6d. a fall of over 27 p.c.
Admittedly the shares have since re-
covered to around 605., but at this level
they are still 10 p.c. lower than at any
time since the beginning of the 1962-63
fiscal year. “What has happened to
cause this fall?” and “Are the shares
good buying at current prices?” are two
questions which need answering.
It is now two years and six months
since I last wrote about Drug Houses
and at that time the point was made that
the “free drug” scheme provided an in-
built growth factor so far as the com-
pany was concerned. Publicity in recent
weeks suggests that this growth has been
very rapid indeed and the cost of the
scheme is causing very real concern.
The question of profit margins and
prices has now reared its head in this
country as it did in the USA some
twelve months to two years ago. No
doubt the manufacturers here will have
some effective arguments in justification
of their prices even though they are not
apparent at the moment but, so far as
Drug Houses is concerned, the question
was answered in the chairman’s review
published in mid-September when he
stated “. . . we being predominately
wholesale distributors are not enjoying
either exhorbitant or unrealistic profits.
We are still trading under the same
terms and conditions accepted and ap-
proved by the authorities at Canberra as
being a fair and reasonable margin at
the time of the initiation of the pharma-
ceutical benefits scheme.”
Tn demonstrating the “fair and reason-
able margin,” Mr Mcßoberts quotes
figures which indicate that group sales
were of the order of £27f million in
1962-63, but unfortunately on this
occasion he has omitted to give us the
percentage increase in sales which has
taken place over the twelve months.
However, we can produce an interesting
series:
INDEX 1957/58 = 100
Year to June 30 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
sal « „ 113 118 127 137 n.a.
Trading profit 116 130 142 161 135
Earnings 107 112 128 132 118
There can be little doubt that until
1962-63, trading profit was increasing at
a greater rate than sales and it is sur-
prising that earnings have not increased
at an even greater rate. The clue to this
is no doubt given in the tax provision.
With the exception of the last year,
earnings per share have increased
steadily since 1956 despite the fact that
ordinary capital has increased by over
£1.3 million (two-thirds of which was
issued to existing shareholders at par).
Again the chairman offers some ex-
planations in his review of 1962-63. They
seem to be as follows:
(a) “Our gross earnings were also
affected by substantial reductions in the
official price for antibiotics listed under
National Health Act regulations, and
(b) “. . . the loss of the exclusive dis-
tribution and manufacturing arrange-
ment for Lederle products which we
enjoyed until the end of November last
in terms of our agreement regarding the
establishment of Cyanamid DHA Pty
Ltd.”
(c) “. . . no dividend was received
from Cyanamid DHA Pty Ltd during
the year as that company’s accounting
period ends on 30th November.”
The last two are closely related and
there can be little doubt that this year’s
earnings have been reduced on a “once
and for all” basis. DHA did not receive
any benefits from the investment in
Cyanamid which is intended to compen-
sate for the loss of the franchise for
Lederle products. Although dividends
when paid during the current and future
financial years will not completely re-
place the profits from the Lederle
franchise, they should produce some
improvement over 1962-63 figures.
All in all one gets the impression
that a better year is to be expected in
1963-64 and it is to be hoped that the
upward trend in per share earnings will
be resumed. Even so, how is one to
assess the premium that should be paid
for future growth in a company that has
not increased its dividend for five years?
From 1952-53 to 1958-59, per share
dividends, after making adjustments for
the two new issues which were made
during this period, increased by over
100 p.c. The actual rate of dividend
was increased from 6 p.c. to lli p.c.
But the 6 p.c. rate was a low rate as
two years previously in 1950-51 8i p.c.
had been paid.
For the future, it is difficult to see
that the company will need to raise any
capital from shareholders. A new ware-
house is to be built at Launceston,
Tasmania, but it appears that this will
complete the modernisation programme
which has been going on for a few years.
The company has buildings surplus to
requirements and the sale of these will
provide funds. There are no long-term
liabilities and if the company should
need to raise funds it could obviously
borrow quite substantial amounts as
freehold and leasehold property “at
cost or directors’ 1956 valuation”
appears in the balance sheet at over £5
million.
It would seem therefore that share-
holders must look for increases in the
dividend rate either directly or from
bonus issues in the future. If we calculate
the average annual compound rate of
growth in the dividend rate only over the
last nine years, we find that it has been
about 4 p.c. In selecting this period, we
have avoided the low dividend period
of 1951-52 to 1953-54 inclusive and we
have included the five-year period when
there has been no increase in the rate.
This rate of increase could continue for
the next nine years at least without any
increase in earnings provided that the
company was willing to accept a 100
p.c. payout rate. However, even the
gloomiest observer would expect to see
the company's earnings continue to
increase even if only at half of the 8 p.c.
per annum rate which applied over the
five-year period to June 30, 1962.
One therefore feels confident that the
next ten years will see increases com-
parable with the last ten years so at
current prices around 60s. the shares
look reasonable buying. At this level,
they should be particularly attractive to
corporate investors who virtually receive
dividend income tax-free as the return
in the long run should be equivalent to
a fixed interest security yielding 12 p.c.
before tax.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
“No Easy or Quick Path”
“We have set ourselves the tasks of
increasing our market penetration
by our ANI Perkins merchandising divi-
sion, of developing new and difficult
metal-forming techniques, and expanding
output of our own products.
“There is no easy or quick path to
any one of these ambitions nor can
they be accomplished cheaply. Their
achievement will in the long term in-
crease only profitability and the security
of our business.”
So said the managing director of Aus-
tralian National Industries Ltd in his
report to shareholders attached to the
accounts for the year to June 30, 1963.
Group profit had risen over the year
from £34,795 to £198,294 after again
providing only a nominal sum for tax at
£4452 (1961-62 £3800), and charging
£165,831 (£163,580) in depreciation
and amortisation.
The group has undergone tremendous
change since it was first known as John
McGrath Industries Ltd in 1950, and is
still adjusting its interests.
John McGrath was a Sydney motor
agent and dealer in motor accessories.
In 1951-52 it established Beverley Bright
Steels (sold in 1959 for £257,000 cash),
John McGrath Motors (Qld), National
Forge Pty and Perkins Pty.
In 1954 it acquired a 61 p.c. interest
(later increased to 100 p.c.) in Melbourne
Iron and Steel Mills, selling it six years
later to the Cyclone subsidiary, K-M
Steel, with obvious relief.
The company assumed its present
name in 1956. It still serves the motor
industry, but has only one motor dealer-
ship left, at Lidcombe (NSW).
Although five motor dealerships were
dropping during 1962-63, company sales
rose 14 p.c. from £B.B million to £lO.l
million. In the managing director’s
opinion the automotive industry will
achieve record sales in 1963. Probably
1964 sales will continue at about the
same rate.
ANI is now firmly entrenched in forg-
ing and in the merchandising of metals
and machinery.
The two forges produced 13 million
separate forgings from 25,000 tons of
forging billet. Supplies of billet were
rather uncertain, so that production
runs were unfortunately short.
The manufacturing division developed
a crankshaft for a new Australian car.
It will produce blades for the RAAF
Mirage fighters.
ANI Perkins is setting up a metal
service centre in each State to market
steel, aluminium, fastening materials
and allied products.
The ANI group has franchises from
Australian Iron and Steel, BHP, Brun-
tons Bright Steels, Chrysler (Aust.),
Comalco, Commonwealth Steel, Fords,
Geo. H. Martin, John Lysaght, K-M
Steel and other Australian, US, UK and
continental firms.
Sales of local steel rose by one-third,
and results of marketing aluminium for
a full year were encouraging.
The group supplied Theiss-Peabody-
Mitsui Coal with a large dragline
excavator during 1962-63. It installed
oxygen compressors for BHP at Port
Kembla and Newcastle, and a bloom mill
at Newcastle. The company is hopeful
of fostering the principle of long wall
mining techniques in Australian coal
mines.
J. and C. Johnson, Melbourne metal
merchant and engineer, suffered from the
instability of the scrap metal market.
However, 1962-63 profits were better
than expected and 1963-64 should show
further improvement, according to the
managing director.
Emergency tariff protection has been
obtained against the import of flanges
from overseas marginally priced for ex-
port. ANI awaits a full Tariff Board
inquiry.
ANI is closely following the overseas
developments in cold and warm forg-
ing techniques, which may supersede hot
forging for certain components. It has
introduced cold forging techniques to
\ustralia, yet points out that nine months
t least may elapse between receipt of
.amples and quantity production for each
new component.
The Sinter plant should be fully load-
ed within 12 months, when extensions
will be contemplated. Establishment
costs of this project have been a heavy
burden on current profits, but are con-
sidered worthwhile for the long term.
Capital expenditure contracted for at
balance date was £102,681, compared
with £53,839 a year earlier.
The company made a further invest-
ment of £160,000 in the new cold forg-
ing and sintering projects, and in the
forges.
An extra £200,000 borrowed in 81
p.c. notes improved liquidity during the
year.
The group has had a patchy profit
record. It is too early to declare that
all its difficulties have been surmounted.
Management has tackled enormous
problems realistically, with funds being
fairly well conserved.
At about 9d. below par, the ss. shares
show an income yield of 7.1 p.c. from
the current dividend rate of 6 p.c. The
erratic dividend history would debar
most institutional investment, but an
individual willing to accept a fair degree
of risk might benefit from price appre-
ciation over the short term.
However, it should be realised that
the company has to treble the 1962-63
pre-tax profit before it would earn a bare
10 p.c. after normal tax provision.

How many nights must the show go on to reach an audience of a million?
Just one . . . on the channel 9 network! The rough thing about TV, said one performer, is
that the show always closes on the opening night. To reach an audience of a
million in a theatre, Bobby Limb's "Sound of Music" would need to play ten shows
a week for 12 months. On the channel 9 Network it reaches that million in the
course of one exciting, wonderful, entertaining hour.

INTERNATIONAL RESISTANCE HOLDINGS
Diversification Pays Off
A policy of product and market diver-
sification has paid off for Inter-
national Resistance Holdings Ltd.
Once strongly geared to the television
industry (49.1 p.c. of total sales in
1959-60 were to television and radio),
the company has broadened its market
and now supplies 68.4 p.c. of its turn-
over to general industry.
After a two-year set-back, Inter-
national Resistance was able to report a
profit of £.300,784, very close to the
record established in 1959-60 of
£310,393.
Earning rate was 20.3 p.c. on capital
increased by a two-for-five issue at 100
p.c. premium in October, 1962. The
121 p.c. dividend rate ruling since 1957
remains unchanged.
Directors said business within Austra-
lia was unsettled by changes in policies,
alignments and patterns of world trade,
coupled with protracted negotiations over
some Australian trade agreements.
Demand for components of TV re-
ceivers and domestic appliances was on
a reduced scale, particularly in the last
quarter of the year. On the other hand
demand for International Resistance pro-
ducts in the radio, electronic, automo-
tive and general industrial fields was
better.
Although some price cuts were neces-
sary to meet local and overseas com-
petition, a record turnover was achieved
—9.39 times the 1950 level.
Share premium reserve was augmented
by £412,000 (to £833,500) as a result
of the issue to shareholders. Total re-
serves and undistributed profits less good-
will more than equal paid capital.
Prior to the recent issue there were
two placements of substantial premiums,
a one-for-four issue at 100 p.c. pre-
mium in August, 1959, a two-for-five
issue at par in January, 1959, and a one-
for-two par issue in February, 1956.
Capital was also increased in March,
1960, by a small takeover.
Members of the group produce resist-
ers, transformers and other electronic
components at Kingsgrove (NSW), cables
at Dee Why (NSW), capacitors at Pres-
ton (Vic.) and gauges at North Rich-
mond (Vic.).
During 1962-63 part of the manufac-
turing operations of Melbourne-based
KLE Control Equipment Pty Ltd, which
makes valves and gauges, was trans-
ferred to Sydney and integrated with
other activities in the Marrickville plant,
where the group’s engineering shop is
located.
In September, 1963, Precision Elec-
tronics Pty Ltd of Melbourne was ac-
quired for the issue of 63,000 ss. ordi-
nary shares. A subsidiary of International
Resistance was sole distributor for many
years of the products of Precision Elec-
tronics. Directors said this acquisition
would enable its production to be in-
tegrated with the manufacturing pro-
cesses of the Sydney plants, with bene-
ficial results.
Manufacturing agreements are held
with American, British and Swiss firms,
to whom International Resistance has
access for technical assistance.
The group is well regarded in the
trade and in financial circles. Its pro-
gress has been braked by the economic
restrictions of the last three years, but
the company has revealed no weakness
as a result.
The march of automation in com-
merce and industry will provide a widen-
ing market for International Resistance
products. The boom days of TV (with
its high earning rates) are over, yet
steady growth is more or less assured.
At 16s. to yield 3.9 p.c. on a
well-covered 121 p.c. dividend, the shares
should prove a valuable acquisition to
all investors for whom immediate in-
come is not of paramount importance.

BUSHELLS INVESTMENTS LTD
Giving Investors a Break
npHE consumption of coffee is gradually
-*• replacing tea drinking in Australia.
No matter which sells best, Bushells In-
vestments Ltd stands to benefit.
The company is the largest tea and
coffee merchant in Australia. The Stock
Exchange market has quite rightly given
it the status of an investment leader.
The Bushells group has a long and
successful history in the Australian tea
world. In 1937 it set up a separate
operation in New Zealand.
It floated as a public company in late
1958 when shareholders, mainly the
Bushell family, placed one-twelfth of the
issued capital of £1,704,499 in 20s.
shares with the investing public at
30s. 6d.
Brooke Bond and Co. Ltd, of London,
holds about 20 p.c. of the issued capital.
In 1960, the first full year after
flotation, profit had a sharp setback due
to keen competition from a wide range
of instant coffee distributors. The com-
pany has made a strong recovery and
last year reported record earnings of
£451,277 equal to 26.5 p.c. on capital.
Even the 1960 profit covered the 10 p.c.
dividend paid each year since flotation
almost twice.
The latest result is after making a
special provision of £25,000 for stock

All responsibility for election comment in this
issue is token by Peter Hastings, of 252 George
Street, Sydney
and lifting the reserve to £lOO,OOO, a
wise precaution in view of the possibility
of wide fluctuations in the overseas
prices of tea and coffee.
The accounts to June 30 last show
the company to be in a strong position
with current assets considerably more
than twice liabilities.
In the past five years, stock has in-
creased from £2.4 million to £3.1
million, reflecting the gradual growth of
the market in line with the growth in
population.
Fixed assets have almost doubled to
£2.9 million since flotation, following
the transfer of most activities to premises
at Concord Stage 3 of the project, the
transfer of the tea packaging and ad-
ministration activities, is in the planning
stage.
Installation of new plant recently at
Concord has enabled the group to meet
increasing demands for coffee, at the
same time freeing the original instant
coffee plant for transfer to New Zealand
where production began in April.
The capital reserve position is par-
ticularly strong and the company is
an obvious bonus prospect. Disclosed
capital reserves consist of share
premiums of £337,384 and a suiplus on
consolidation of £757,329. They are
more than sufficient for a one-for-two
issue.
In addition, freehold and buildings, in
the books at a depreciated £1,992,333,
are at 1954 valuation or cost, leaving
plenty of margin for a revaluation.
Australia might be considered a nation
of beer drinkers, though statistics show
they are still no mean tea drinkers.
While Bushells continues to occupy the
premier position as the largest tea and
coffee merchant in this country, its
shares will continue to command
premium prices.

METROPOLITAN INDUSTRIES LTD
Getting Away From the Cold
fire which 26 years ago destroyed
the Victorian Government’s cool
store proved to be the spark which
caused the growth of Metropolitan In-
dustries Ltd to one of the largest cold-
storage groups in Melbourne.
Today it operates through seven sub-
sidiaries in a wide variety of fields in-
cluding transport, motor body building,
panel beating and spray painting, ice
works, egg grading and frozen-fish im-
porting.
Capital increases by issues to share-
holders have been slow, the last one
being a one • for - five bonus and a
simultaneous one-for-two cash issue in
1951 which lifted paid-up capital in
ordinary shares to £362,950.
This remained unchanged until 1961
when in each of the three following
years, takeovers resulted in an increase
in capital to the present £385,068.
A shortage of working capital was
partly relieved in 1962 with a placement
of £lOO,OOO 8 p.c. registered unsecured
notes with a currency of 10 years, but
another issue, probably shares, appears
imminent.
Profit earning capacity has been good
except for 1955, when a loss of £94,494
occurred following the decision to dis-
continue the manufacture of refrigerators.
Since then, profit has recovered to a
record £80,655 in 1960 and last year
was £71,420, equal to 18.1 p.c. on capital
after allowing the 7 p.c. preference
charge of £1470.
After three years at 9 p.c., ordinary
dividend was lifted to a well covered
10 p.c.
The shares are currently selling around
10s. to give a dividend yield of 5
p.c. and an earnings yield of 9.1 p.c.

Spring Cleaning the Portfolio
TLTuch of the financial news these days
concerns annual meetings. Like the
Brigadier, I enjoy tripping along to
some of them. Unlike the Brigadier, I
remain somewhat quieter on arrival.
As the market price of a share falls,
so rises the number of people attending
the annual meeting of the company con-
cerned. The United Motels meeting was
packed. Most of the talking was done
by the male shareholders, although
several women kept on muttering cryptic
comments. “Sit down,” seemed to be
the most popular one.
Despite these somewhat cynical re-
marks of mine, the meeting was a con-
structive one. It was decided to elect
a committee of shareholders to consider
the appointment of two extra directors
to the board. To the credit of the chair-
man he heeded the requests of the share-
holders.
At this stage I have no direct interest
in this company. It was in the portfolio
some time ago.
So was ODE. In fact it’s a pity I sold
out of ODE some months ago as the
share price has continued its steady
upward course. An incredible company,
for in five years asset backing has been
doubled and dividends raised in each of
the last three years.
The 42 p.c. rise in profits for the past
year was primarily due to the increased
working days for the five rigs owned by
the company. Oil exploration con-
tracting is a hard game, but ODE has
successfully pushed itself to the top.
Increased oil subsidies (a strong possi-
bility if the Labor Government took
over), or the discovery of another com-
mercial oil field would both speed up
oil exploration. However, if neither
happened, oil exploration activity should
continue at about the same level for
some time yet. To quote one of those
wonderful cliches: “The continent has
only just been touched.”
As an investment 300,000 fully-paid
shares and 1.5 million options are held
in ODE. Throw in the fact that the
shares yield 6 p.c. and you have got
that rare combination of a high yielding
growth industrial stock with a very nice
stake in oil exploration. I bought 2000
shares at ss. 6d.
For the other purchases of the week,
I turned to buying rights. Perhaps the
one with the greatest scope (upwards I
hope) is Mobile Industrial Equipment.
Its earning record is not unlike Hanimex.
After losses in the late ’fifties, profits
before tax have shown a steady rise
since. Although the earning rate in 1963
was 19 p.c., a dividend of only 6§ p.c.
was paid. This was not a defensive
move—more a case of conserving funds
for expansion. Apparently further funds
are required as the company is now
making a l-for-4 par issue.
All different kinds of equipment are
manufactured for use in timber clear-
ing, land clearing, fencing and the
handling of wheat. Under the direction
of George Pizzey and Son Ltd, which
now owns about 40 p.c. of the shares,
Mobile has been transformed into a
most efficient enterprise. A purchase of
1000 rights at 3s. 4d. was made.
The other rights that looked well
worth following up were W.J. Manu-
facturing. Here again is another com-
pany making a return to the portfolio.
During its absence, a very good result
and l-for-4 issue at 3s. premium have
been announced. With the rights about
Is. below their theoretical value and
over a month for them to run, they’ve
got plenty of time to catch the fancy
of the market. In went my order for
2000 at 4s. llid.
A late spring clean for the portfolio
led to the sale of Carpet Manufacturers,
Hunter Douglas, AOG and Keith Harris.
Taking into consideration the dividends
paid, the two small losses were £9
greater than the two small profits.
Transactions for this week were:
SOLD
200 Carpet Manufacturers, 24/6 £251
200 Hunter Douglas, 32/- £315
400 Keith Harris, 29/6 £591

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Daylight Saving and the Farmer
Clinging to the time of God and the stars
pV)R all their thrift, something Aus-
tralian farmers don’t want to save
is daylight.
In other countries—the United States,
Turkey, Russia, China, Poland, Ger-
many, Japan, Canada, South Africa,
Brazil, Portugal and even our neighbor
New Zealand—farmers go along with
the rest of the community in observing
daylight saving during the summer
months, but in Australia they cling to
the time of God and the stars.
Senator Anderson (Tib. NSW) knew
this when he, last August, proposed legis-
lation for the introduction of daylight
saving. At the time the issue fizzled out
after a shower of ayes and nays had
fallen on it including an especially
heavy downpour from the farmers. But
the question of daylight saving is far
from extinct.
Tots of things have been said in favor
of it, but their essence seems to be ex-
pressed in the words of an employer
who said recently: “It is silly as it is.
We are up with the frost before dark
in winter, and waste two of the best
hours of the day lying in bed on summer
mornings.”
The secretary of the Victorian Em-
ployers’ Federation, Mr S. M. Gilmour,
said: “Australians have not yet seen the
light.”
T>y and large, the arguments in favor of
daylight saving are just dizzy enough
to give its adherents something of the
aura that emanates from causes like
anti-vivisection and pole-sitting.
Advocates of advancing the clocks in
summer to swing an hour of light from
the beginning to the end of the day in-
clude in their reasons better health, closer
family ties, more supervision of children,
increased leisure and the bringing of
Australia into line with other countries.
Daylight saving has been advanced
as a part-solution to Sydney’s traffic
tangle, and in their search for justifica-
tion its suporters behaved as though they
had found gold when it was proposed
that the New South Wales 'Public Ser-
vice Board might consider daylight
saving in investigating the possibility of
staggered hours for public servants.
Even psychiatrists are in on the act.
Said one: “Daylight saving would help to
save broken homes” implying, per-
haps, that family troubles begin in the
dark.
Bolder champions, attempting more
practical justification for daylight saving,
have claimed that it would save elec-
tricity, but the Victorian State Elec-
tricity Commission said recently that the
saving in summer would represent less
than 3d. a week on the average house-
hold bill.
Under the Australian Constitution, the
States and not the Commonwealth con-
trol the hands of the clocks. The only
time this country has seen daylight
saving was when it was introduced under
Commonwealth wartime emergency
powers when industry was straining
and a depleted labor force was working
overtime.
Tn one of its weekly service letters, the
A Victorian Employers’ Federation
urged the Premier, Mr Bolte, to bring
up the question of daylight saving at the
next Premiers’ Conference adding,
wryly, that Mr Bolte, being a farmer,
might take some convincing of its merits.
The difficulty in achieving what the
Federation wants is not so much that
Mr Bolte is a farmer but that his State
is Victoria. Most farmers have objections
to daylight saving. Those who offer them
most strenuously are the dairy farmers,
and Victoria is the Commonwealth’s
foremost dairying State.
In repudiating daylight saving, the
dairyfarmers’ reasons sound as practical
as those of its advocates seem airy. In
the first place cows are creatures of
habit, and science has shown that only
when they are milked in the same order,
at the same time, in the same way each
day will they produce the most milk.
For this reason the dairyman works
to the clock more than any other kind
of farmer and as much as most indus-
trial concerns, yet he doesn’t want the
clock to dislocate his rhythm twice a
year by jumping forward an hour and
then back again.
Advocates of daylight saving have
been heard to suggest that tampering
with the clocks need not concern the
farmer because he could stick to his
own time and let the town stick to its.
But farmers, especially in dairying, can-
not sever their links with the rest of the
community.
One dairyman said recently: “It’s no
good sticking to nature’s time and having
the milk ready for collection each day
an hour after the truck has gone past.”
And the cow’s routine is not the only
obstacle.
The general secretary of the Vic-
torian Dairyfarmers’ Association, Mr K.
W. Thorne, said recently that about a
third of his members supplied whole-
milk for human consumption. Those
whose milk was collected twice a day in
summer would have to do the evening
milking an hour earlier under daylight
saving, at a hotter time of the day, and
this would increase the already consider-
able problem of maintaining its quality.
/"Outside the hard core of wholemilk
producers, however, Victorian dairy-
men have lately shown some relaxing of
their traditional antipathy to daylight sav-
ing. Mr Thorne said it could well be that
they might go along with daylight saving
if the advantages of it to the rest of the
community could be demonstrated. He
stressed, however, that the subject had
not been discussed by the Association in
recent years, although it was coming alive
again and he thought it inevitable that
it would find its way on to the agenda
for a meeting of the Association’s execu-
tive in the near future.
The position with other organisations
is similar. Farmers’ attitudes to daylight
saving have so far been expressed “over
the fence,” as it were, by individuals,
but the time is coming when pressure
from urban interests must produce
echoes from the rural community’s of-
ficial voices.
In 1956, a Gallup poll showed that
58 per cent of Australians approved of
daylight saving, with 32 per cent op-
posed and 10 per cent of no opinion.
Analysis of the poll showed that only
38 per cent of farmers were for it,
compared with 52 against and 10 per
cent of no opinion.
Now, seven years later, acceptance of
daylight saving could be substantially
higher on farms, where tennis courts,
swimming pools and the farmer’s share
of the country’s rising prosperity may
have implanted some of the convic-
tions that possess the daylight savers in
the towns and cities where the lights are
brighter.


Dairying Looks Best at Home
Gathering overseas pennies instead of pounds
Had a stock-taking been made in
Australia last week of the
country’s dairy industry, no one
interested in its welfare could have failed
to be pleased.
Butter was flowing to England under
a revised quota that guaranteed the dis-
posal of all this year’s production, sales
of condensed milk had risen 40 per
cent over the previous year’s, successes
had been achieved in turning milk and
its constituents into new forms, bulk
cheese was being exported to Manila
and Italian-type cheese to Italy, Victoria
had just tested its millionth cow in a
campaign to eradicate tuberculosis,
officials had returned from India with
plans for establishing a market there
and the British Broadcasting Corpora-
tion had chosen the kangaroo as the
symbol for a new television channel
just when Australia was launching its
“Kangaroo” brand of butter in Britain.
Like an oyster, however, Australian
dairying often looks better from within
than without.
Home last week with a dose of the
outside view was Mr W. A. Beattie,
agricultural consultant, author, adviser
to the Commonwealth Government and
one of the most travelled men in his
field. He had been on a five weeks’
jaunt around the Milk Run, whose main
stops, Malaya, Thailand, the Philip-
pines, Formosa and Hong Kong, form
the front on which Australia is waging
a battle to develop markets to replace
those that have become precarious in
Europe.
Men like Mr E. G. Roberts, chairman
of the Australian Dairy Produce Board,
are almost giddy with doing the circuit.
So, too, are some of the reports of Aus-
tralian successes in these areas. Mr
Beattie, who was on an investigational
survey for private interests, made it seem
that in some respects we are rejoicing
over pennies while others scoop up the
pounds.
One of the big obstacles to selling
dairy foods in Asia is that people there
associate them with disease. Milk im-
properly handled is one of the best
incubators of germs you can get, and
Asians, who own no refrigerators, have
over the centuries acquired a built-in
aversion to what is literally poison to
their children. They wean babies
straight on to fruit juice because it is
safer.
In overcoming this prejudice, the
Danes have stolen the show. Australia,
certainly, is establishing plants at several
centres for reconstituting milk products
from powdered raw materials represent-
ing some of the export surplus for which
we are trying to find a home, and it
is making advances with products sold
direct from here. But the Danes are
going one better. Not only are they
flooding the “converted” parts of Asia
with dairy products. They are preparing
the way for selling the Asians a con-
tinuous stream of the animals that
produce them.
In Thailand, for example, they have
set up a big dairy farm so that the Thais
can do everything for themselves from
growing grass to distributing the butter
from their milk. And the Danes, of
course, will keep this dairy and others
that will follow supplied with high-grade
stock that the Asians themselves cannot
breed. The King of Thailand was in Den-
mark last year as part of a clever Danish
public relations move. He went home
bubbling with enthusiasm for the Danish
dairying industry. It looks as though
the Danes are in Thailand to stay.
Imported dairy products are a drain
on the foreign reserves of Asian
countries, so if dairies can be started, in
even a token way, to show them how to
produce milk and its products without
wasting foreign currency it cannot but
impress them. If such dairies are set up,
they can win their sponsors a reputation
that will help sell not only what comes
from the dairies but their entire range of
dairy products. In broaching the Asian
market, Australia has not made enough
allowance for the fact that people there
have no taste for milk.
Tf the Danes are thorough, the Japan-
ese are practical. They are over-
coming Asian dislike of milk by flavor-
ing it to taste like the favorite fruit
drink of the country concerned.
The Australian Dairy Produce Board,
in conjunction with local Asian interests,
has developed outlets over which it
expresses much pride, but just as it is
hard for developed countries to quote
spectacular figures for further develop-
ment so it is relatively easy for Aus-
tralia to boast 100 per cent increases
in sales on Asian markets if it is starting
from scratch. Mr Beattie’s criticism of
Australian markets is that they are
limited to places like hotels and
embassies, and do not spill out into the
populace. For this to happen, he thinks,
people involved in exporting must know
not only the production and economics
of their product but the language,
history and customs of people to whom
they are trying to sell.
The value of “getting to the people”
was underlined to him on his trip. In
one of the countries he visited, he used
an English bank. The introductions it
gave him were confined to English and
American firms. He did not get beyond
them. In the next, country he relied on
a local bank for introductions and was
directed to only local firms. The results
were infinitely more valuable.
It is not only in the dressing up of
milk products that the Japanese are
making us look simple. Everywhere Mr
Beattie went in Asia people said things
like: “We want to buy your livestock be-
cause you are good to our students, but
we cannot because the Japanese article
is much better”.
VlT'ondering how the Japanese, with
” scarcely enough land to stand on,
could have gained such glory, he investi-
gated and found the Japs are paying big
sums for the best stud stock they can get
from England and elsewhere, breeding
it in Japan and selling the progeny,
complete with unchallengeable produc-
tion records of the ancestors.
The turnover of the animals is so fast
that the operation depends more on
books than acres. Asians told Beattie that,
unlike the Danes, the Japs and the Dutch,
Australia does not supply performance
records with livestock, but only the ani-
mals themselves, take it or leave it.
The tragedy that others and Beattie
see in this is that Australia has both the
resources to supply the goods and the
goodwill of countries that want to buy
them, yet is missing out through care-
lessness, stupidity and apathy. The irony
receives a twist from the fact that in the
one line of development South-East Asia
needs to establish its own dairy industries
the breeding of tropical legumes —■
Australia, through CSIRO, is probably
leading the world. It is on these plants
rather than the livestock that could one
day be eating them that Asian eyes are
fixed. Dr J. Griffiths-Davies, in charge
of the Tropical Pastures Division of
CSIRO in Queensland, is better-known in
Asia than the Prime Minister.
Both in distance and tradition, it is a
long way from Asia to the British market
to which Australia has always looked for
bread to put its butter on, but there the
story is something the same. In Mel-
bourne on a brief visit to Australia, Mr
Fred Adams, managing director of the
world’s biggest butter distributing com-
pany, said that of all the butter imported
from various sources to Britain, by far
the oldest and stalest came from Aus-
tralia.
From a satchel Mr Adams plucked a
glossy picture showing workmen at his
Staffordshire factory unloading butter


from Australia. The date on the back of
the print was 10 months later than that
which stood out, ringed, on each of the
boxes. He has received Australian but-
ter up to 12 months old, when the fra-
grance is entirely gone and the stuff
tastes negative and flat. Adams thought
the outside limit on age for butter should
be six months, and preferably three.
Rival New Zealand rarely supplies but-
ter older than three months, and Danish
butter when it reaches Britain is usually
about three weeks old.
Mr Adams has been trying for ages
to get younger butter from Australia, but
without success. “The position today is
just as it was 10 years ago”, he said.
His complaint comes at a time when
Australia’s new brand of butter, “Kan-
garoo”, is being launched on the British
market. It is planned to spend £30,000
on initial promotion and follow this with
an annual budget of £50,000.
There have been many jokes about the
choice of “Kangaroo” as a name for the
new brand, but market surveys and Bri-
tish importers, including Mr Adams,
affirm that this is all to the good in terms
of publicity and sales.
They may change their view if the
butter that finds its way into the new
packs is as hoary as some of the rest
has been. “Kangaroo” is one thing.
“Old Man Kangaroo” is another.
Wool Men Turn the Screws
Putting the squeeze on election candidates
all the pre-election screws that are
being turned, not least is that
powered by Victoria’s militant Wheat
and Wool Growers’ Association.
Only twice in Australian farming
history has an organisation put the
squeeze on candidates to declare their
hand on an issue before an election, and
the association has taken the honor both
times.
On the first occasion it applied the
technique to bring into line two indepen-
dent Federal members in the voting that
led to wheat stabilisation in the early
’forties. This time it is being used in an
attempt to block legislation for increasing
the wool promotion levy should the Aus-
tralian Wool Industry Conference re-
commend it in January.
The action expresses the policy vigor-
ously championed by the association at
State level, and almost as vigorously by
the Australian Wool and Meat Pro-
ducers’ Federation at Federal, of refusing
to pay more for wool promotion until
growers are given what the association
likes to call an “honest marketing
system”.
Registered letters have been sent to
all candidates standing for Victorian
country seats. They seek assurance from
the candidates that, if they are elected
in the poll on November 30, they will
oppose the wool levy legislation until the
marketing question has been settled.
The letter points out that at its 1963
annual conference the association re-
affirmed its determination to resist any
increase in the wool levy until this con-
dition was met. It says: “Upon receipt
of your answer, or otherwise, it is the
intention of this association to acquaint
its members through its official newspaper,
before the coming Federal elections, of
the reaction of all candidates to the
association’s stand on this matter”.
It draws candidates’ attention to the
fact that the readership of the paper ex-
tends to some 50,000 voters, apart from
the influence wielded by the association
through its weekly State-wide radio ses-
sion over 11 Victorian country broad-
casting stations. The letter says if a
candidate makes no reply it will be taken
that he or she is not prepared to give the
undertaking. The letters have gone to
some 50 candidates.
The response to the association’s move
has consisted of more than applause. Al-
though, since the Victorian Graziers’
Association modified its policy on wool
by switching its objective from free auc-
tions to the appraisal system, the associa-
tion is no longer directly opposed on the
issue it is defending, the graziers have
reacted as of old.
“Attempts to coerce Federal election
candidates into promise of support for
so-called orderly marketing are utterly
irresponsible,” fumed their president,
Mr R. C. Webb
Wool marketing and promotion were
" separate issues, he said, yet the
VWWGA was trying to take the right to
make decisions out of the growers’ hands
before they had had a chance to con-
sider them.
“This is political blackmail of the
worst kind”, continued Mr Webb. “I hope
all candidates will ignore the threats
that have been directed at them.
“It is absolutely wrong for one organ-
isation to attempt to foist its own policies
on the wool-growers of Australia before
they have had time to form their own
opinions on the two vital issues of pro-
motion and marketing”.
The Victorian division of the Aus-
tralian Primary Producers’ Union will
not support the VWWGA move, either.
Replying to Mr Webb, the president
of the VWWGA, Mr P. J. Meehan, who
predicts disaster for the industry if
marketing is not put before promotion,
said it was established practice in a
democracy at election time for the in-
dividual voter or group of electors to
ascertain the thinking of candidates on
any subject that vitally affected them
before deciding for whom they should
vote. What the VWWGA was doing on
this occasion was just an extension of
that right.
“I hope few candidates will be foolish
enough to heed Mr Webb’s advice to
ignore the matter. Mr Webb must have
a poor opinion of the intelligence of
growers if, after all the propaganda and
publicity that has been given to the wool
question over the past few months, he
thinks they are still unable to form an
opinion”.
“Finally”, he said, with what must
have been relish for one whose associa-
tion has often been sniffed at by the
graziers, “I deplore the extravagant pro-
vocative language used throughout his
comments”.
charge of blackmail has not been
A enough to make the association feel
ashamed. On the contrary, its official
announcement of the intention to make
the candidate do a polling dance was at
pains to explain that the action was
modelled on that commonly employed
by the powerful American Farm Bureau
Federation, representing 1,600,000 US
farm families and which forms the back-
bone of the farm bloc that exerts such
influence over American Adminstrations.
The statement added, somewhat omin-
ously, that the action showed how Aus-
tralian farmers could operate to achieve
reforms for primary producers of all
kinds once unity of farm organisations
became a reality.
Such unity is the goal of an organ-
isation called the Unity Study Group,
through which Victoria’s four leading
farm organisations are laboriously trying
to weld themselves into one.
The association’s action was sudden
but not surprising. For months it had
threatened to “go political” on the wool
issue. Sir Robert Menzies’ own sudden
but unsurprising announcement of the
early election triggered the delicate
mechanism controlling the organisation’s
restraint.
# A factor that has played some part in
the tightening of the association’s grip
on the wool levy question is the Govern-
ment’s decision to match £ for £ any
additional funds growers might put up
for promotion. Obviously it was easier
to persuade growers to refuse to work
out £2 16s. a bale than the 335. which
would be the most they would be called
on to pay under the terms of the Federal
Government’s generositv.

Closing Pastures
for Hay
/\ne of the farmer’s spring problems
” is when to close pastures for making
hay of surplus growth.
In drier districts paddocks must be
closed fairly early so that there is suffi-
cient growth to get a worthwhile cut of
hay. There is no such urgency where
spring rains can be counted on. In all
cases, the decision when to close should
depend on whether the hay secured will
compensate for the grazing lost.
It should be taken into account that
grazing converts spring pasture growth
directly into milk, meat, or wool. Pro-
duction of these will certainly suffer
if, to make sure of hay, stock are on
winter rations, which cost money, when
they might still be on pasture. Then, too,
15 to 50 p.c. of food value is in-
evitably lost in the silage or hay made.
Farmers in Gippsland’s high rainfall
areas have been advised by Mr J. Hos-
king, the Department of Agriculture
agrostologist at Warragul, not to close
paddocks for silage or hay until pasture
really gets ahead of stock.
