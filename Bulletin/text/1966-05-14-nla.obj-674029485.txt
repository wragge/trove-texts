Slanting the News
Sir,
The charge of slanted news presenta-
tion, sometimes levelled against the ABC,
was strengthened by the recent segment
of “Four Corners” dealing with right-wing
groups in Australia, reviewed by Frank
Roberts (B. April 30).
In it, through the use of misleadingly
selective assembly of unrelated events, sup-
port for Australian troops in Vietnam and
opposition to Communism generally were
equated with racialism and anti-Semitism.
That this misrepresentation has been suc-
cessful was clearly demonstrated, when
even your reviewer was deceived by it,
for he states that “people Penlington
interviewed labelled them (the anti-anti-
Vietnam demonstrators) racist, pro-
apartheid, anti-Semitic.” In fact, the
people Penlington interviewed were re-
ferring solely to a particular racist maga-
zine, but their remarks were deliberately
cut in two parts to make them appear as a
general condemnation of the supporters of
the Australian position in Vietnam instead.

Egg Subsidies
Sir,
We noticed a reference in The Bulletin
indicating that there is a subsidy to the
egg industry (8., March 26). This mis-
reporting originally occurred just after the
budget was announced by the Government
last year. In the estimates of expenditure
was an amount of some £3,500,000 to cover
the payments to the industry for equalisa-
tion purposes, to be made out of the
Poultry Industry Trust Fund.
The reporters apparently overlooked the
fact that the Poultry Industry Trust Fund
is contributed entirely from the industry
itself, per medium of the Bird Levy im-
posed under the Poultry Industry Levy
Act, 1965. The same figure appeared in
the Government estimates of revenue. The
only manner in which the Government is
involved is by the provision of legislation
enabling the levy to be borne equitably by
all producers (other than specific exemp-
tions mentioned in the Act) and to permit
the distribution of the same amount to
assist the stabilisation of the Industry.

The Penkovsky Papers
Sir,
Dr. Knopfelmacher’s review of the book
“The Penkovsky Papers” (8., April 30)
seems to be not a review but a vehicle
for the doctor’s anti-Communist dogma-
tisms. If it were intended to be a review,
then surely he should have spent a little
more space examining the authenticity of
the “papers.” They have been dealt with
pretty well by Victor Zorza in an article
published in “Life International” of
November 29, 1965. This recognised
authority on the Soviet Union concludes
that the papers are in large part the pro-
duct of the American Central Intelligence
Agency. For instance, Penkovsky in the
book refers to Khrushchev when he met
him in 1939 as “a man I had never
seen before.” Strange, since he had just
spent two years in Kiev, the capital of
the Ukraine, when Khrushchev was First
Party Secretary there and as such in a
position where he could hardly miss being
seen by anyone in the Ukraine at the
time.

Taiwan the Unknown
Sir,
The statement in the House of Represen-
tatives recently by Sir Wilfred Kent Hughes
(Lib., Vic.) that Australia should have
diplomatic representation in Taiwan makes
good sense. Sir Wilfred was supported by
Mr. W. C. Wentworth (Lib., N.S.W.), who
claimed that the Government should have
appointed an ambassador to Taiwan years
ago. I have just returned from a tour of
Taiwan, at the invitation of the Govern-
ment of the Republic of China, and while
there I was asked by government officials,
businessmen, and newspapermen: “Why
doesn’t Australia have an ambassador here
since we’ve had an ambassador and consul
in Australia for years?”
It was a difficult question to answer. All
I could say was that I had heard that the
question of appointing a trade commis-
sioner or an ambassador was being con-
sidered. Surprisingly, little is known in
Australia about Taiwan, the island pro-
vince of the Republic of China and the
present seat of its government. Many do
not recognise its new name of Taiwan and
think of it still as Formosa, a small island,
shaped like a tobacco leaf, about half the
size of Tasmania. Few realise that although
only one-third of Taiwan is arable, more
than 13 million Free Chinese live there at
a standard which is the highest in the Far
East, with the exception of Japan. Taiwan
is a fairly valuable neighbor for Australia,
not merely from the defence point of view
(since it is one of the free world’s prime
military bastions in the Far East) but
from the point of view of trade.
Six months ago, Taiwan’s trade balance,
in favor of Australia, was nearly $lO mil-
lion. According to trade officials in Taiwan
and the Consul-General (Mr. Wu San-
shih) in Sydney, there is ample room to
increase Australia’s exports to Taiwan by
more than 100 percent. A scant 20 years

The current vintage of Barossa Riesling is
bottled in green bottles for those who like
their Rhine Riesling to be youthfully fresh
and crisp.
For those who prefer their Riesling to be aged
and rounded, with the developed character-
istics that come from bottle ageing, Barossa
Riesling is in the traditional European amber
bottle. Amber glass keeps out the light and
protects the wine while it is ageing.
Because of the time it is held and the care
taken during ageing, the older vintages are
more expensive than the Riesling in green
bottles.
Since its inception in 1953, Orlando has won
more awards than any other Australian
Riesling - including a Gold Medal in 1964
and 1965 at Montpellier, France.

Out Where?
Sir,
It seems odd that Australians and
Britons still refer to “Going Out, Coming
Out, to Australia,” etc. The use of the
adverb out arose in imperial Britain to de-
note a sense of great distance and isolation
which was perfectly valid in the nineteenth
and the earlier part of the twentieth cen-
tury. Surely expressions such as out here,
etc., are anachronistic and quite incon-
gruous to Australia’s stature as a nation
today.

Technicians and Dentists
Sir,
Your article (B. April 30) concerning
the long wrangle between dental mech-
anics and dentists unwittingly gave a
totally false impression of the position.
Your article stated that “The dentist takes
the impression and the technician makes
the denture.” What actually happens is
that the dentist takes the impression and
casts models of these.
On these models the dentist (or his
—mechanic if he employs one on the
premises) then makes “lite blocks,” rims
of wax on a steel-wire strengthened base
plate, and with these, at the next appoint-
ment, ascertains the biting position of the
jaws and the “vertical dimension,” or
space between the ridges in their correct
position. He then gives these models and
wax records to the technician (or mech-
anic), who sets the teeth up in wax accord-
ing to the bite records and instructions
from the dentist.
The dentist then “trys in” these wax
temporary dentures, and adjusts indivi-
dual teeth for functional efficiency and
aesthetics. He then gives these wax den-
tures to the technician to duplicate in
plastic. The dentist then fits the finished
dentures, and adjusts the dentures as re-
quired. Thus the dentist sees the patient
at least five times, and quite often 15
times, to make the dentures.
The prices quoted by Mr. Lang are
quite fictitious. The ordinary suburban
dentist charges from $BO for a good com-
plete set of dentures (full upper and
lower sets) and most illegal technicians
charge the same fee, although they are
entirely without training or qualification
for this work. As one who was a tech-
nician myself for eight years, let me say
that I agree entirely with Dr. Derek Free-
man that the Minister’s statement is “a
victory for commonsense.”

To start with, it’s on the girl, not the car. Avis
cars don’t have red gears (most of them are
automatics, anyway) but the Avis girl wears a red
uniform; that’s so you can easily pick her out at
airports or railway stations or wherever you
asked us to have your Avis car waiting. Frankly,
this red gear costs us a lot of money, but we
take pride in the way our girls look
just as we’re proud of the way our cars
perform. For example, wipers that wipe,
blinkers that blink, starters that start. And a
proper insurance policy that means what
it says protects you, not us. Next time
you need a car, look for the girl in the red gear.
You’ll find her at capital city and
country airports, every major rail terminal.
If that doesn’t suit you, give us a ring.
We’ll send your car along.

Polyethylene film bag's could save you
several thousand dollars a year on
your packaging costs. A far fetched
figure? Far from it. Polyethylene film
is one of the lowest priced packaging
materials—a fraction of the cost of
some of the expensive materials. And
polyethylene film bags are extremely
simple and economical to use. So
simple in fact that they can often
greatly reduce the cost of putting your
product into its package.
As a package, polyethylene film bags
have other outstanding advantages.
They are transparent. They are imper-
meable to dust, dirt and moisture.
They can be antistatic to prevent dust
accumulation.

tical ways to improve your packaging
and reduce its cost with polyethylene
film bags. We can also put you in
touch with a bag supplier who can
supply you with free bag samples and
prices.
When ordering direct from your bag
supplier, be sure to specify one of the
“Union Carbide” polyethylene resins
(listed at right) on your order. That
way your bag supplier will know what
you want and you’ll know what you
are going to get: a bag made from top

Why Hanoi is Confident
HPIHE Prime Minister’s report to
-*■ Parliament on his South-east
Asian tour last week made one major
point briefly that deserves more
detailed treatment. After stressing
the main point about the situation
in South Vietnam at the moment —
that North Vietnam and its southern
Army, the Viet Cong, are losing the
war and that even the recent politi-
cal convulsions did not set us back
militarily he went on to stress that
military defeat of North Vietnam
does not in itself mean total defeat
for the Communists or victory for
us. “As they are checked in the
military sphere,” he said, “the Com-
munists are likely to intensify their
efforts in the political sphere, not
only seeking to promote distractions
in Vietnam but in wider political
offensives through their agents in
other free countries of the region.”
To understand this fully it should
be read along with last week’s reports
from the National Assembly in
Hanoi. The Hanoi leaders despite
military set-backs in the South and
U.S. bombing in the North are
still clearly confident of victory. They
envisage a very long war which they
will ultimately win after an Allied
political capitulation. In fact, they
even see grounds for confidence in
the increased commitment from
America, Australia, Korea, and other
allies. They assume the Americans
will commit up to 400,000 men,
increasingly take over political con-
trol in Saigon, and consequently
intensify political discontent among
the nationalists. As South Vietnamese
protests intensify and as Arrierican
deaths multiply, the situation in
Washington will seem increasingly
hopeless. At the same time the
demands within the United States for
withdrawal will increase until a f£ce-
savings formula to cover defeat
under the name of negotiations will
be found.
Hanoi does not believe this will
happen soon, but it is confident that
it has more patience and will-power
than the Americans just as in the
early 1950 s it had more than the
French. It believes that military
defeats in South Vietnam are now
less important than mounting pro-
tests in Washington, New York, Los
Angeles, Chicago, and one may add
Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and
no one should underestimate the
importance of Australian public
opinion to the Americans simply
because our military commitment
is comparatively small.
This analysis must sharpen the
debate at home, making it more
important to distinguish those who
oppose our policies in good faith
from those who, as Professor H.
Arndt of the Labor Party said
recently referring to some ALP
leftist leaders actually want the
Communists to win in Vietnam.
Never before in a major war has
there been a significant group of
Australians, including leaders of an
alternative government, who deliber-
ately if often naively pursue policies
which the rest of their countrymen
recognise as threats to our freedom,
independence and survival.
As this becomes clearer to all,
Australian political debate will
become uglier but it is clear that
the more men who speak out like Pro-
fessor Arndt the better. The French
were beaten not at Dien Bien Phu
but in Paris; if we are beaten, it will
be in Washington, Canberra, WeL
lington. There is one big difference:
the French could withdraw to
Europe, we and our Asian allies must
establish our freedom or go under.


CANBERRA
The Robbery in Parliament House
THE rifling of the office of Dr. Rex Patterson (Labor, Qld.) at Parliament House,
Canberra, and the removal of three “highly important and confidential” files has
left the parliamentarians with a considerable sense of uneasiness.
There have been robberies before in
Parliament House —of amplifying equip-
ment put in for the late Mr. W. M.
Hughes, who was deaf, for example
and there have been instances of un-
authorised and even dangerous intruders
wandering around the House. I can re-
member walking down the steps leading
from the Press Gallery to the Government
lobby to see what I at first took to be
two messengers struggling on the ground
outside the office of the Prime Minister,
then Mr. Menzies. Not until one of these
on the ground called: “Give me a hand,
Alan—he’s got a knife,” did I realise that
what was going on was something really
serious. As it turned out, the second
person involved in the struggle was an
individual who had broken his way into
Parliament House during the night,
secreted himself, and had then set out to
locate Menzies, against whom he nourished
some real or imaginary grudge.
Happenings such as these are inevitable
in the history of a huge public building
to which many people with no official or
unofficial connection with the building
have the right of access. But the Patter-
son incident had nastier overtones, especi-
ally when considered with the earlier dis-
appearance from the room of Mr. Tony
Luchetti (Lab., N.S.W.) of a report on
northern beef roads which had inexplic-
ably found its way into the Parliamentary
library, though nominally listed as a con-
fidential 'and secret government document,
and which had been borrowed properly
and legitimately from the Parliamentary
library.
Nobody could sell the northern beef
roads report for money, as Mr. Hughes’
amplifying equipment could have been
sold. Similarly there was no value, other
than political value, to the files taken
between midnight last Wednesday and 6
a.m. last Thursday from Dr. Patterson’s
office. Whoever had done the rifling had
some knowledge of the workings of Par-
liament House.
According to Dr. Patterson the person
had placed newspapers strategically over
the Venetian blinds of the office so as to
lessen the possibility of a watchman’s atten-
tion being drawn to the fact that the light
was on at such a late hour and the watch-
man possibly identifying who was in the
room when patrolling the lobbies in the
parallel wing, from which a view can be
secured across a courtyard.
Further, whoever the intruder was, he
had been selective in his choice of docu-
ments. There were other files in the room.
He took only the ones that Patterson de-
scribed as “highly important and confiden-
tial” and which contained, among other
things, correspondence between Patterson
and the Government on the occasion of
Patterson’s resignation as Director of
Northern Development in the Department
of National Development to contest the
Dawson by-election.
Happenings of this nature in Parliament
House are rare. Whatever their short-
comings, Parliamentarians live, by and
large, under a pretty strict code in their
personal relationships. They will fight like
Kilkenny cats in the Parliament. Some of
them carry their feuds on outside the
Parliament and will not say good day to
each other or accept personal courtesies
(though this type of parliamentarian is the
exception rather than the rule), but there
are certain conventions which they do
observe. They respect each other’s privacy,
and a man’s room is sacrosanct.
Though I doubt whether the position
will continue, there have been very few
private rooms kept locked in Parliament
House. Some Ministers have kept their
rooms locked, but this has been to protect
highly secret documents from non-
Parliamentary rather than Parliamentary
intruders.
As I see it, the puzzling thing in the
Patterson Case is the motivation. Who-
ever took Luchetti’s report could use it
and claim that he got access to the mat-
erial he used from one of the six copies
of the report that found their way into
the Parliamentary library. But whoever
took Patterson’s files cannot use material
from them without identifying himself
as the thief.
But even if the material is never used,
the incident has certainly shaken parlia-
mentarians. The democratic system has
had a civilising influence upon their basic
jungle-like political instincts and they
have evolved certain traditions to which
they rigorously adhere. One tradition is
their privacy.
ALAN REID
CRIME
The Lash
FOR those in New South Wales politics with long memories, the disagreement between
Attorney-General Mr. K. M. McCaw and his junior Cabinet colleague, Mr. J. C.
Maddison, Minister of Justice, on whether a prisoner should be flogged did not
come as any surprise.
Said Mr. Maddison, “While I am Mini-
ster for Prisons no inmate will be
whipped.” Mr. McCaw maintained that if
a judge ordered a whipping it should be
administered. Although no whipping has
been carried out in a N.S.W. prison for
more than half a century the issue is far
from being resolved.
In the case of Mr. McCaw, his views
reflected his own distinctive convictions
about crime and punishment.
When in March, 1955, the peppery
Labor Attorney-General, Mr. W. F.
Sheahan, introduced Crimes Act amend-
ments including abolition of the death
penalty in the N.S.W. Legislative
Assembly, he sent a shiver of division
Mr. Maddison—“Not in my prisons.”
through the Liberal-Country Party Oppo-
sition that remains today. Some mem-
bers of the Opposition spoke against, at
least one spoke in favor, but most did not
speak at all. To cover the different opin-
ions within the Opposition the abolition
was allowed to go through without being
forced to a vote.
Predictably to his friends, Kenneth
Malcolm McCaw was the strongest sup-
porter of abolition within the Opposition,
even, he remarked to an interjector, for
such cases as treason and piracy. But his
alternative was a shock. After stating that
there were more severe deterrents (than
the death penalty) for major crimes, Mr.
McCaw added: “If the person who com-
mits these types of crimes knew they
would suffer the lash on their own bodies
once every twelve months during their
incarceration, I believe that would be a
greater deterrent than the death penalty.”
Mr. McCaw went on: “In quelling the
spark of human life we are taking some-
thing we cannot create.”
At 57, and member for the middle-class
electorate of Lane Cove since 1947, Mr.
McCaw is a complex figure. Raised in a
poor home, he left school at 12 and later
battled through law at night school. And
against the first signs of an inherited eye
disease that has almost blinded him, and
inevitably will.
By traditional political standards, he
should have been attracted to the Labor
Party. But held back because of its social-
ist policies, he instead moved into the
Liberal Party. To the stodgy and incom-
petent Liberal Party of the late ’4os
and early ’sos he brought rare freshness
and ability and with the support of the
party machine his advancement was cer-


tain. His concise and measured speeches on
legal issues and his constant demand for
law reform made it clear that when Labor
fell he would receive the portfolio of
Attorney General.
In background and temperament, Mr.
McCaw is the antithesis of Mr. John
Clarkson Maddison. Both share a desire for
social and legal reform, but Mr. Maddi-
son, who entered parliament in 1962, and
is now 43, is more radical in his approach.
Where Mr. McCaw grew up in a strongly
Methodist atmosphere, Mr. Maddison de-
veloped in an artistic, accomplished and
affluent family environment. His father
was an executive in a major drug com-
pany and his grandfather was G. H. Rog-
ers, a principal figure in Sydney’s theatri-
cal life.
After an education at Sydney Grammar
School and war service in the islands, Mr.
Maddison graduated in Arts and Law from
Sydney University. He entered Parliament
by defeating in a pre-selection ballot Mr.
S. A. Storey, who to the impatient Mr.
Maddison was identified with the “Old
Guard” of the Liberal Party. The dif-
ferences shown between Mr. Maddison and
Mr. McCaw on whipping are symptomatic
of a division running through the Govern-
ment parties which is deep and appar-
ently irreconcilable.
The sudden emergence of the issue last
week took members off balance and ex-
plained the reluctance of some, both Lib-
eral and Country Party, to state their atti-
tude, and the clear differences between
them. Uncertainty reaches up to Mr. Askin
himself. In 1955 in the abolition debate,
he said: “I subscribe to that body of
opinion that opposes abolition of the death
penalty, though I have an open mind on
the subject.”
Again last week, Mr. Askin declined to
be drawn. The question of flogging, he
said, was hypothetical because Judge Cur-
lewis had not actually imposed such a
punishment.
DEVELOPMENT
Port Hedland's Dream
THE Federal and West Australian Governments have been lifted neatly from the
horns of a nasty dilemma by a secret meeting in Honolulu last week. The
dilemma was in reconciling the Federal resolve to retain 50 percent Australian
equity in the Mt. Newman group against the West’s desires to open up as much of
the North as possible.
There was conflict because it seemed
that relinquishing part of Australia’s half
share to American Metal Climax Incorp.,
the other partner, was the only way of
getting iron through the increasing ex-
pensive outlet of Port Hedland. And be-
cause Port Hedland is as far from Dam-
pier—the other major north-west iron
port —as Sydney is from Newcastle, this
would have been a bitter blow to Western
Australia. In fact, Port Hedland is looked
upon as a potential Newcastle of the
North-West
The Honolulu meeting was between rep-
resentatives of three of the iron ore min-
ing groups —Mount Newman Iron Ore Co.
Ltd., Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd., and Cliffs
Western Australian Mining Pty. Ltd. They
discussed dozens of alternatives, and their
recommendations are yet to be made pub-
lic. But if Western Australia gets its way
(and the State has strong veto power),
the outcome will make Port Hedland the
world’s biggest iron ore port, a staus that
only a few days previously was being pre-
dicted for Cape Preston, 180 miles down
the coast.
Discussing the alternatives, the State’s
North-West Minister, Mr. Charles Court,
allowed himself an uncharacteristic out-
burst: “If we could have a Press holiday
for a month we would come out of this
with something even more worth while
than we had in the beginning. But the
Press want us to negotiate this thing on
a street corner.” His terse and formal
Press release ended by warning: “At this
juncture I think it is undesirable to con-
Mr. Court - the Press needs a holiday
jecture what the final proposals will be.
In the meantime, the State’s development
desire and the CSR Australian component
are priority considerations.”
But these final words are the big clue.
Only by other organisations joining the
Mt. Newman group on the Port Hedland
railway can the State’s development desire
and the Australian components be satis-
fied. Everything points to this being done.
Mt. Newman is contracted to sell only
100 million tons of 350 million tons of
high-grade hematite so far proved in the
Mt. Whaleback region, 225 miles south of
Port Hedland. If BHP and Eclipse (a
consortium of Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co.
of Ohio —51 percent —Mitsui and Co.
Ltd. of Tokyo—3s percent, West Austra-
lian Garrick Agnew Pty. Ltd — 1\ percent,
and other interests—6| percent) shifted
base 240 miles south-east to Mt. Whale-
back, they could share this deposit—and
with it the costs of getting the ore out of
Port Hedland.
No doubt some concessions would be
called for, but the West would be in a
horse-trading mood if Port Hedland could
be thus set up. As it is, Mt. Goldsworthy
Mining Associates (equal shareholders,
Consolidated Goldfield, Utah Construc-
tion and Mining, Cyprus Mines) is ex-
porting through Port Hedland, and there
deposits 60 miles east of the ports cut out
within 30 years. They- have been offered
leases near Mt. Newman after this. But
this would not fit into the master plan if
by then Mt. Newman’s ore was being
shipped westward through Cape Preston.
Presumably both BHP and Cliffs would
hope to gain from such a deal. It would
allow Mt. Goldsworthy to retain their Port
Hedland facilities, keep the Australian-
American balance of Mt. Newman and
make Mr. McEwan pleased, and allow
Mr. Court to win a point. But most im-
portant it would make a lazy little town
ringed with mangrove swamps into Port
Hedland, a major shipping terminal with
an exciting build-up starting this year and
rising to an average of at least 7 million
tons annually over the next 25 years.
No doubt the Western Australian Gov-
ernment still hopes to get the best of all
worlds—a major port at Port Hedland, a
large one at Dampier, and eventually one
at. Cape Preston—but is no longer de-
manding that everything comes good at
once.
DEFENCE
N.Z. Conscripts?
To meet its military commitments over-
seas, the New Zealand Army is consider-
ing a two-year conscription scheme for 20-
year-olds instead of the present three-
month stint.
The Army is at present conducting an
extensive recruitment campaign for 300
volunteers for the infantry regiment in
Malaysia. The campaign ends late in May
and the men will leave New Zealand
probably in December. According to
Brigadier A. H. Andrews, of Army Head-
quarters, Wellington, the response has not
been particularly good during the past few
weeks. “If the worst comes to the worst,”
he said, “and the campaign is not a suc-

cess, the Government will have to make

its commitments.”
During the past month several metro-
politan newspapers have speculated that
the Army is considering the two-year
scheme. But Brigadier Andrews was quite
non-committal when reporters broached
the subject. “We are always thinking of
ways and means to overcome our difficul-
ties. Conscription has not been suggested
to the Government,” he said.
However, political commentators in Wel-
lington say the Army will make a request
in a report to the New Zealand Army
Board stating that the Army in its present
form is unable to maintain its commit-
ments in South-East Asia.
High-ranking officers favor two-year con-
scription and many of them agree that
the present system of national service train-
ing is of little value. Army services have
generally been improved lately with in-
creases in pay, extension of rehabilitation
loans, and promises of training in Fiji. But
the Army still remains desperately short of
good men.
GORDON CHESTERMAN
S.E. ASIA
Another Domino
I AM here simply to get help for
Thailand betore it is too late,” said
French Jesuit Father Alfred Bonnin-
gue last week in Melbourne.
Now 58, Dr. Bonningue has lived in
Asia for the past 26 years and is at present
Professor of Modern French Literature
at the University of Bangkok. He said last
week that Thailand was in the same posi-
tion as Vietnam was six years ago. Two
years back there was little or no Com-
munist activity in Thailand, but since then
Peking has set up the headquarters of the
Free Thailand Movement and the Thai-
land Liberation Front. Agents of these
movements were now at work near the
borders of Laos and Vietnam.
Father Bonningue said that the under-
standing of Communist subversion which
had followed the activities of the Hanoi
controlled National Liberation Front in
South Vietnam was one factor working
in Thailand’s favor. Many Asians now rea-
lise the nature of Communist subversion
in Vietnam, although the message has
not apparently been fully received in the
West, where people were sometimes fooled
by the elaborate camouflage which Com-
munists erected to disguise their move-
ments.
Apart from the possible necessity of
military assistance Thailand needed a pro-
gram of massive rural development
and social reform. It does not even have
radio transmitters powerful enough to
reach peasants in outback areas, whereas
these peasants are already being reached
by Radio Peking.
Before his eleven years in Thailand
Father Bonningue worked in China as a
teacher and lecturer. He remembers the
Communist takeover in 1949 and how this
was welcomed by many Chinese intel-
lectuals who thought that the Communists
were only agrarian reformers. Many of
them paid the price of their ignorance
with death or suffered severe mental tor-
ture whilst undergoing brainwashing,
Father Bonningue spent three years in
jail in China from 1951 to 1954. “I was
subjected to three years and 20 days of
extreme mental torture as the Communists
tried to load my mind with guilt and to
force me to say that I was an American
spy. For days on end I was subjected to a
barrage of non-stop questioning by politi-
cal inquisitors who were accompanied by
storm-trooper sadists who would kick me
in various parts of the body if I hesitated,
displayed reluctance to answer, or showed
any discourtesy.”
Father Bonningue managed somehow to
survive the psychological torture and was
released in 1954. He has since learnt that
a Catholic professor in China, a former
friend, was forced to write a play about
him in which he was depicted as a spy
selling Chinese secrets for U.S. dollars.
“The Communists work both brutallv
and subtly to destroy not only individuals
but any groups who show the remotest
sign of intellectual independence. The
jails are full of scholars, so are the graves.”

TRADE
Wheat Dilemma
IS it necessary for a delegation of the
Australian Wheat Board to go to Hong
Kong to negotiate another wheat sale
with Communist China?
Last year’s drought conditions over large
parts of our wheat belt (especially in New
.South Wales and Queensland) reduced
our wheat crop by over 100 million bushels
(as compared with the previous harvest);
it has been claimed that there will be
wheat available for export enough only
to supply our “traditional customers,” such
as Britain, Japan, India, New Zealand,
Ceylon, and alike. Why then the Con-
ference in Hong Kong next month with
the China Resources Company (which
is the wheat purchasing organisation for
Mainland China)?
The unpalatable truth is that even in
a drought year our wheat surplus is too
large for the commercial demand of our
regular customers in the so-called free
world. In the 1965/66 wheat year the
Wheat Board has to dispose of 260 mil-
lion bushels, which means a surplus of
about 180 million bushels for export.
The fact is that the demand for Aus-
tralian wheat in the 1960 s by non-
Communist countries has been about the
same as in the 1950 s between 100 and
120 million bushels annually. If Aus-
tralia does not want to have a burdensome
.carryover of wheat on the 30th Novem-
ber, 1966 (when the silos are opened for
delivery of the new wheat) the Wheat
Board simply has to negotiate with Com-
munist countries which means China,
especially. It is no use blaming the
Wheat Board for the controversial wheat
sales to China; the Wheat Board is a
selling organisation and not a policy-
making authority.
The only way out of this dilemma is
to reduce our wheat acreage to about 13
million large enough for our local
consumption and for the commercial
demand in the free world. However, due
to deliberate Government policy, Aus-
tralia’s wheat acreage has risen from its
post-war low of 7.9 million in 1957/58
to 17.9 million in 1964/65. It has been
forecast that our 55,000 wheatgrowers
will plant an all-time record of up to 19
million acres during this current sowing
period (as compared with an average
acreage of 10.3 million in the 19505). With
this tremendously expanded wheat acreage
we simply have to sell to Communist
countries, especially China.
Australia’s taxpayers have subsidised
our wheat export to the remarkable
amount of 82 million dollars over the last
six years (or as it is officially called: con-
tribution of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment to the Wheat Stabilisation Fund).
Our wheat acreage would adjust itself to
a manageable size if the “guaranteed
price” clause would be excluded from the
next wheat legislation. Every sensible
student of the Australian wheat industry
is in favor of “orderly marketing” through
the highly efficient Wheat Board, but
why subsidise a prosperous industry? Our
Glebe Island: Loading wheat for Peking.
legislation favors the growing of wheat
more than possibly any other land use; I
often wonder why?
A switch from wheatgrowing to grow-
ing of fine wool or running of beef cattle
would be in the interest of the Australian
economy as a whole; and, in addition, it
would “deliver us from the evil” of
selling wheat to China if it is considered
politically unwise or morally indefensible.
Why not try to bring about a change in
land use by withdrawing the subsidy from
wheatgrowing and encouraging an expan-
sion of the meat industry?
Despite our poor harvest, 20 million
bushels have been shipped to China since
the beginning of December, 1965; since
February, 1961, the large amount of 450
million bushels of Australian wheat has
been purchased by .China. In 1964/65
Australia exported 267 million bushels, of
which about 150 million bushels were
shipped to China and the Soviet Union;
in 1962/63 China alone bought 109 mil-
lion bushels of a total export of 226 mil-
lion bushels.
This explains why a delegation of the
Wheat Board has to go to Hong Kong,
even in this “drought wheat year.” The
Wheat Board simply has to “nurse” our
best customer; the delegation wants to
assure China that we consider her by now
as a “traditional customer” getting prefer-
ence even if our surplus is smaller than
usual. The proponents of Australia’s
“Wheat Production Unlimited” policy
cannot see anything wrong with this
development, but even Mr. McEwen had
to admit in Parliament growing
number of people feel “uneasy” about this
addition to our “traditional customers.

MINING
Opal Miners’ Drive-Out
ADDED to the constitutional and administrative problems which have beset the
Labor Government since it took office in South Australia last year is an unex-
pected challenge from the arid north: the hot, dry wrath of the opal miners.
Plans are being laid in Andamooka and
Coober Pedy for a “drive-out” from the
opal fields down to Adelaide when State
Parliament resumes in June. The miners
intend to picket Parliament House in pro-
test against recent government regula-
tions affecting the industry.
A sign of their earnestness is that the
miners, amongst whom are represented all
the nations of Europe and half of the
world’s rest, have formed themselves into
the Australian Opal Miners Association,
under the chairmanship of Mr. John
Cormack, a former solicitor now turned
miner.
The South Australian Government
recently brought opal miners under the
provisions of the Gold Buyers Act. The
objections of the men of Andamooka and
Coober Pedy are:
• Under this act a person who is not
personally known to the buyer and is also
not personally known to a well-known
reputable person is unable to sell his
opal;
• The process of selling opals has been
made so formal and complex by the
applications of gold buying regulations
that the secrecy which is an accepted part
of the opal miners’ trade will be difficult
to maintain.
• The new regulations apply only to
South Australia and there is nothing to
prevent those few miners who produce a
large quantity of opal from selling in
Melbourne or Sydney.
• The rules for the granting of licences
give too much arbitrary power to govern-
ment officials against whom there is no
satisfactory right of appeal.
Their biggest fear, however, is that the
real purpose of the government in apply-
ing the new regulations is the introduction
of a State tax on the sale of opals. The
State Government is well known to be
desperately short of finance. The Govern-


ment claims that its major concern is to
bring law and order to the industry and
that if any tax is applied it will simply
compensate the administration for the ex-
penses involved in regulating the industry.
There is strength in both sides of the
argument. But the miners could hold the
trump card if they can demonstrate to
the Government that the new regulations
will not affect the big producer, who will
be able to afford to go interstate and sell,
whereas the burden of the regulations and
any new tax will then fall on the not-
so-successful miner, who must stay home.
UNIVERSITIES
Dr. K
THE Knopfelmacher case has gone in-
ternational. The London -published
quarterly “Minerva” has now car-
ried articles by central local figures in the
case, Professor A. K. Stout and Professor
R. N. Spann, as well as Professor Sidney
Hook, chairman of the Philosophy Depart-
ment at New York University, and one of
Dr. Knopfelmacher’s referees has also com-
mented on the case.
In the autumn 1965 issue, Professor
Stout attacked the breaches of confidence
which occurred during the course of selec-
tion committee and professorial board
deliberations on Dr. Knopfelmacher’s ap-
plication for a senior lectureship at the
University of Sydney.
More importantly, Professor Stout gave
his judgment on the case: “I admit that it
was almost certainly hostility to him, based
partly on his politics but mainly on his
personal attacks on political opponents,
that prompted the initial move of two
members of the board to challenge the
committee’s recommendation. In that
sense, and in that sense only, did political
considerations play a part in the board’s
decision.”
Professor Spann, who supported Pro-
fessor D. Armstrong in recommending Dr.
Knopfelmacher’s appointment, writes of
his alarm at what he describes as “a state
of mind which cannot be discussed mainly
in terms of ‘politics’ or even of conser-
vatism.”
“I was alarmed by the small number
of academics prepared to discuss a con-
troversial question openly, with some
genuine belief that academic values are
provoked by pursuing a point and by ex-
posing their minds to (sometimes un-
welcome) evidence.” Professor Sidney
Hook concludes a typically convincing
analysis of the evidence and the issues by
making the point:
“Imagine a case in which a qualified
candidate approved by a selection com-
mittee, without any dissenting vote, turned
out to be as strongly Communist in his
views as Dr. Knopfelmacher is anti-Com-
munist. If the Professorial Board had acted
in his case as it did in the case of Dr.
Knopfelmacher and on the same alleged
grounds, I am confident that the academic
community in Australia, as well as in
every other Anglo-American country,
would overwhelmingly regard the action
as a clear violation of the principles of
academic freedom.”
SCIENCE
Who Shrunk the Wool?
RECENTLY, the Australian Press, radio, and television featured prominently an
announcement by CSIRO that its Wool Textile Laboratory at Geelong had dis-
covered a “revolutionary new process for the shrink-proofing of wool.”
The announcement added that this
“marks a major step forward in the pro-
duction of machine-washable textiles”
presumably wool textiles since cotton,
synthetic, and other types of textiles have
been fully machine-washable for scores
of years.
Apart from mentioning that the process
involves treating the wool with weak,
water-based solutions of chlorine and an
unidentified synthetic resin, no technical
details have been released either in the
Press hand-out or in the scientific litera-
ture. Further claims by CSIRO for the
process are that it prevents “pilling”
(the formation of those objectionable balls
of fibre on the surface of woollen fabrics),
does not reduce fibre strength, can be
applied to the wool at the “top” stage,
i.e. before it is spun into yarn, requires
only simple equipment, and is inexpen-
sive -
All this sounds strikingly similar to a
shrink-proofing process announced in
America about three years ago and des-
cribed again last March by Dr. Harold
P. Lundgren of the U.S. Department of
Agricultures Wool and Mohair Labora-
tory, Albany, in the semi-
technical British weekly New Scientist”
( vol. 29, No. 485, pp 566-7), which
circulates widely in Australia. This re-
cent re-statement of the American pro-
cess seems to have been made to record
the commercial facts. These are that
several million yards of shrink-proofed
wool fabric were produced in the U.S.A.
during 1965, that a wide variety of gar-
ments made of the treated wool had won
customer acceptance, and that adoption
of the process is now spreading rapidly
throughout the entire wool textile indus-
try in America.
The synthetic resin used in the current
American method of shrink-proofing is
nylon, because it happens to be the cheap-
est of several alternative polyamides on
the American market at the moment and
is readily available. The treated wool
contains less than one percent of nylon,
which is grafted chemically to form a
coat less than a millionth of an inch
thick around each wool fibre. This is
enough to give the fibres a smooth surface
and so prevent wool’s natural tendency
to felt, which is the cause of shrinkage.
The American author concludes his
article by outlining an even more recent
discovery made in his laboratory con-
cerning the application of resins to wool
and says that it “widens the range of
polymeric finishes possible for wool that
will help to keep this ageless natural
fibre up to date.”
It is incredible that the scientists at
Geelong might be unaware of what has
been going on in a sister laboratory in
California and the process announced
with some fanfare by CSIRO must surely
be superior, or at least differ in some
important respects. Whatever the dif-
ferences, they are not obvious from the
reports. The Americans have not stated
precisely the effectiveness of their pro-
cess. But Geelong has not done so, either.
Both simply say or imply that their
methods are a complete practical success,
Neither says precisely what the cost of
applying the process is. Both just say
it is cheap and involves no complicated
equipment or heat curing during applica-
tion. The American method does not use
chlorine, which at the concentrations em-
ployed in earlier, relatively unsuccessful
shrink-proofing processes tried both here
and overseas weakened the fibre. But
both say that their latest processes do not
damage the fibre in any way, indeed that
they strengthen it, and that the unique
character and feel of the wool fabric is
unchanged.
Geelong has applied for patents, but
has not claimed patent rights. The
Americans have named their process
“Wurlan,” which seems to imply that it
has been patented. Who cares. Wool has
arrived. Graziers can toast Geelong or
Albany.
APOLOGY
In the issue dated May 7, 1966, THE BULLETIN published a
cartoon depicting a number of people carrying placards, one of which
showed the caption “RING YVETTE” followed by a six-figure number.
THE BULLETIN was under the misapprehension that the number
was a fictitious one, but this is not the case, and the gentleman whose
telephone number it in fact is has complained to THE BULLETIN that
not only is the number shown his telephone number but that he and his
family have been considerably distressed and inconvenienced by its pub-
lication.
THE BULLETIN very much regrets the distress and inconvenience
caused to this gentleman and the members of his family, and sincerely
apologises to them.

MORALS
The Sexual
Revolution
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
AUSTRALIAN sexual moralists have
generally lined up behind one of two
leaders—William James Chidley and
Dr. Norman Haire. Chidley, in the early
years of the century, toured the country
warning people of the dangers of the
current sexual mania, in particular the
dangers of the popular obsession with the
orgasm. He was the apostle of Restraint.
Norman Haire, a generation later, warned
of the dangers of sexual joylessness and
frustration. He was the apostle of Free-
dom. Clearly the Norman Haire camp
has won: symbolically Chidley, after a life-
time of police persecution, ended his days
in a lunatic asylum, where, in another ges-
ture ahead of his time, he died horribly
by pouring kerosine over his body and
setting himself alight. Norman Haire be-
came a sort of hero, his sermons against
monogamy being printed in women’s maga-
zines. Since then his followers have spread
out, infiltrating not only the medical pro-
fession, but universties, schools, churches.
Even if it cannot yet be established
statistically that the morality of “mean-
ingful relationships”—to use the Ameri-
can jargon has replaced the morality
of pre-marital chastity, and post-marital
virtue, one thing is perfectly clear, and it
is certainly a sexual revolution: Western
society after generations of puritanism, pru-
rience, and inhibition no longer regards
sex as basically obscene. Sexual acts and
organs are no longer automatically cap-
tured in the Victorian language game of
obscenity. Sexual talk, no matter how
erotic, cannot without challenge be de-
scribed as obscene: erotic writing, even
pornography, cannot be simply and foully
labelled as “filthy”; sexual feelings and
emotions are no longer unfit for public
gaze; sex is not by definition profane,
nasty, and dirty.
Grateful for at least this revolution, one
may feel inclined to regard rather too
easily those who have replaced the puritan
ethic of duty and rights with the modern
ethic of pleasure, and to look not too impa-
tiently on those who chatter about sex as
“beautiful,” “meaningful,” “wonderful.” (It
is, of course, all these things: but it also
can be dreadful, chaotic, and just plain
ugly. Was W. B. Yeats being merely
prudish when he wrote that “love has
pitched his mansion in the place of excre-
ment”?)
We are still nowhere near the “freedom”
of Restoration London or for that matter
18th-century Sydney (which began its Brit-
ish chapter in 1788 with an open-air mass
debauch that even a thunderstorm could
"Youth, Death and the Maiden,” by Donald Friend
not quell), but sex is at last being restored
to its place as a public property. After the
long, cold, murky decades of frigidity,
guilt, and perversion, it is probably inevi-
table that the social pendulum will swing
to romantic extremes and with some of
the excesses and all of the vulgarity that
romanticism implies, with the hucksters,
the fast-dollar men, and the pubic relations
boys riding with the swing. And, since
there is no inevitability about social pen-
dula, who knows that the driving out of
one demon will not allow seven others to
take its place?
The knock-on-any-door-and-you-will-
find-them stage has not yet been reached,
but look at any bookstall and you will see
them, the pimps, the prostitutes, and the
perverts, the procurers, the ponces, and the
pooves (why does the language of sexual
deviancy begin with “P”?), and, of course,
the poons.
This is part of the paperback catalogue
from any local bookstaff: “CORPORA-
TION WIFE . . . the intimate, revealing
novel that takes you into the bedrooms
and boardrooms of the organisation men”;
“INTIMACY . . . the story that leaves
‘Lady Chatterly’s Lover 3 asleep at the
post”; “ONIONHEAD . . . the wild and
wonderful story of a wartime sea-wolf”;
“JUPITER JOHNSON . . . like a Greek
god of old he strode as a colossus among
men and ravaged their wives, mistresses,
and lovers”; “BEACH PARTY ... the
novel that takes you for a ride with the
surf set, where innocence dies with every
tide”; “WHIP LAREDO”; “THE HOUSE
OF LUST.”
Or perhaps you fancy something a
little lighter, sir? Something in the maga-
zine field, perhaps? You may make your
choice of whole valleys of cleavage. Feel-
ing like satire with your sex? Try “Kings
Cross Whisper,” or “Tom Thumb,” or
“Drongo.” Something for the little
woman, too. What about “True Confes-
sions” or “True Experience”? Sort of more
tactile than all that fictional stuff, don’t
you think?

though we well know that, in company
with a few dozen Women from Aunty,
they are about town: perhaps all off to the
Peter Sellers film, “I AM 16 AND NOT
ASHAMED OF MY BODY.”
There is no longer any escape even to
the safety of the comic strips, which,
after the daily-paper quota of bikinis and
indecent assaults, were once a secure haven
for good clean fun and fancy. Now one
is confronted by the brimming Tiffany
Jones and her bosom pals, the eroticisms
(girls with names like Nubile) and homo-
sexual undercurrents of Garth, the em-
braces of the Jones sisters, the sensual
tensions of Brenda Starr.
Then after Keeping Wonderfully Warm
With Linda all night, shaving with a blade
passed to you by a long black velvet glove,
having a swim to the tune of “She’s-Got-
It-He-Sees It” and going on to meet some
maidens Who Dream They Are “Wanted”
in their bras, even the best adjusted of
men may be excused for feeling like Alex-
ander Pope at the country seat of the
Duke of Chandos: “In plenty starving,
tantalised in state.”
There is, after all, a limit to the amount
of sex a human body can take, but is there
any limit to what the mind can take? Sex
is now scientifically observed, quantified,
and analysed. The bedroom becomes a
clinic. “Human Sexual Response,” by
gynaecologist Dr. Masters and psycholo-
gist Mrs. Johnson, is the book of the first
scientifically conducted large-scale exami-
nation of the sex act in humans. It makes
the Kinsey Report read like a sequel to
“Little Women.” For 11 years the authors
have conducted a sex laboratory in St.
Louis, where they have observed, tested,
and made colored moving pictures of
many hundreds of men and women from
18 to 89 having intercourse and solitary
(or almost) orgasm. The clinic began with
male and female prostitutes, but soon dis-
covered there was no shortage of “normal”
volunteers. Demand for the book is re-
ported to be “fantastic,” and no doubt
those who have read the book will also
want to see the film.
The seller’s market for sexual advice and
guidance is now being met by a growing
and dedicated corps of sexual gurus. In
Sydney are Professor Frederick May and
psychology lecturer Mr. Alex Carey. Mr.
Carey proclaims that “sex is the most
important human sport,” and Professor
May has written for the magazine “Squire,”
our sunbaked and freckled “Playboy,” the
American magazine which advises the
world that “sex is the healthiest and most
important sport,” adding, for no extra fee,
that adultery has probably saved more mar-
riages than it has broken.
Melbourne University’s student paper,
“Farrago,” counsels free love, and in a
page entitled “Sex and the Single Stu-
dent” gives practical assistance by evalua-
ting eight different types of contraceptives
in terms of their reliability, cost, erotic
value, aesthetic disadvantages.
In the U.S.A., but for the world, is
Dr. Rebecca Liswood, Executive Direc-
tor of the Marriage Counselling Ser-
vice of Greater New York. She sends a
constant stream of troubled couples “right
home to practise.” For $4.20 you can
buy her “A Doctor Speaks Her Mind
About Sex” and get the green light to go
to it every night if possible, and in the
morning, too: “As a married woman you
expect to have intercourse with your hus-
band. Every night. I want you to prepare
yourself for this intimate occasion. You
take your bath. You brush your hair. You
brush your teeth. You put on a deodorant.
You put on a pretty nightgown . . . because
you will be richly rewarded for your
pains.”
So, after the long reign of Lord Bowdler
and Lady Grundy, sex has become public.
Sexuality in the English-speaking
world is emerging from the lush
jungles of “taboo,” no longer some-
thing too profane for public discourse
and display, no more regarded by general
agreement as obscene. Puritanism is dead
and the publishers and the mass media
dance around the grave.
Sex in the head?
revolution clearly extends from what
may be publicly discussed to how it
may be discussed. A revolution in attitudes
to obscenity, yes. But has there been a
revolution in sexual practice? A revolution
in sexual morals? Or is it not mostly all
talk, “sex in the head,” as D. H. Lawrence
used to say? Professor at Vassar, Mary
McCarthy’s old school, says the change is
only one of sexual frankness, there are just
as many virgins (or, if you like, as few)
on the campus as a generation ago. The
author of “Sex and the College Girl,” on
the other hand, writes: “I’m convinced
there’s more premarital sex today than in
the early ’sos, when Kinsey published his
study.” The Dean of Harvard College
writes in “The Harvard Crimson” that a
growing number of students are being in-
discreet, and the President of Notre Dame,
Father Theordore Hesburgh, felt obliged
to tell his men recently that, “If anyone
seriously believes that he cannot become
well educated here without girls in his
room he should get free of Notre Dame.”
What is there to be said about Aus-
tralia, where we haven’t even produced
our own Kinsey? A Protestant minister in
Victoria feels it incumbent upon him to
administer physical punishment to local
youngsters found speaking foully and in
the possession of contraceptives. The head-
master of a leading private school con-
demns the loose morals, the drinking
parties, and the irresponsible conduct of
youth in the upper social circles. A New
South Wales bishop orders Catholic girls
not to enter a Wagga bikini-girl contest
and is defied by a slim, dark-haired mem-
ber of his congregation who thinks “the
bishop’s ruling was absolutely stupid and
so far behind the times. After I read
about the ban I thought it was unfair and
very squarish”. (She won the contest.)

What a wine label tells you about
the wine it labels
On the neck of a bottle, you will find
the Vintage seal, which tells you
the year the wine was made, allowing
you to judge the 'age' that the wine
has achieved. In Australia, nearly every
year is a good' year for wine —so
you don't have to memorise a long list
of 'special' years.
Dalwood is the name of the historic
Penfolds vineyard and winery in the
heart of the Hunter Valley birthplace of
many of Australia’s finest table wines.
Here is your assurance that there are
at least five or six'wineglassfulls'
the exact number depends on the
size of your wineglass.

f HERMITAGE '

, deserve Bottling
ipj
This is the name of thd Vintner (the
man, family or firm that made the wine).
When the label of your wine reads
Penfoids, you know that the wine you
are about to enjoy is the product
of 121 years experience in winemaking.
Here you discover the character of
the wine. Hermitage is a variety
of grape, and Claret denotes a red wine
dry and light in body. It’s especially
suitable for meals, particularly barbecues
and good traditional English Roast Beef.
However, don't feel that red wines
must be served only with red meats
a claret can be equally delicious
with chicken or fish.
That's how easy and informative
reading a wine label can be.
Tonight, spend a couple of minutes
reading the label on the wine
you serve. In fact, why not start a
collection of wine labels.

revolution, are there any hard facts?
They are certainly not readily available,
but what is available shows little cause for
alarm. Take, for example, the figures for
illegitimate births. In the period from
1901 to 1910 there were 1.6 ex-nuptial
births per 1000 of mean population; from
1911 to 1920 1.4 ex-nuptial births per 1000
of population; from 1921-30 1 per 1000
of population; 1931-40 .8; 1941-50 .9;
1951-60 .9; in 1962 1.2; 1963 1.2; 1964 1.3.
So the proportion of ex-nuptial births
has increased in the past 30 years, but it is
still smaller than it was from 1901 to
1920. As far as these figures go, at least
in this field the sexual revolution has done
no great harm.
In terms of the States and Territories
the figures for the number of ex-nuptial
live births as a proportion of the total
number of births are as follows:
N.S.W.: 6.7 percent.
VIC.: 5.2 percent.
Q’LAND.: 8.3 percent.
S.A.: 5.9 percent.
W.A.: 7.9 percent.
TAS.: 6.1 percent.
N.T.: 11.3 percent.
A.C.T.: 2.2 percent.
These statistics do not offer necessarily
convincing testimony of the vigilance of
Victoria’s Chief Secretary and his Vice
Squad for, like the national ex-nuptial
birth figures, they do not amount to very
much without at least the assistance of
facts on the number of terminated preg-
nancies and the relative use of contracep-
tive devices and techniques over the past
few generations and from State to Terri-
tory. It does not automatically follow
that South Australia is twice as moral as
the Northern Territory, or Canberra three
times more pure than New South Wales
as a whole. And one would like to know
how a State with Tasmania’s reputation
conies to score lower than Western Aus-
tralia and Queensland.
It is still surprising, sex revolution and
all, that back in crinolined 1900 there were
proportionately more illegitimate children
born than when those allegedly lecherous
Yankee soldiers were here in the 19405.
Yet, in these days of easier abortion and
more readily available contraceptives, it is
surely significant that illegitimacy is only
slightly on the increase. (Contraceptive
manufacturers are extremely careful men.
Their production figures are a closely
guarded secret. However—to use a jour-
nalistic device beloved of American maga-
zines, except that their anonymous wit-
nesses are always from Tulsa, Oklahoma —-
a St. Kilda, Victoria, chemist reports that
his sales of contraceptives have increased
by 250 percent in the past six years; “and,”
he claims, “I can’t prove it at the time,
but quite a number of buyers, I’m sure,
are schoolboys and schoolgirls.”)
Another set of statistics which may indi-
cate the state of sexual morality is pro-
vided by comparing the figures of nuptial
first births with the duration of marriage.
The proportion of first births which
occurred less than eight months aftei
marriage as a percentage of total nuptial
births reads as follows over the past two
generations:
1911-20: 27.7 percent of total nuptial
births.
1921-30: 27.2 percent.
1931-40: 27.2 percent.
1941-50: 15 percent.
1951-60: 18.3 percent.
1962: 23.7 percent.
1963: 25.5 percent.
Allowing for a percentage of premature
births, it can be said that today one girl
in four is pregnant when she marries.
However, back in grandmother’s day the
percentage was higher. On these base
figures there is clearly no indication of a
decline in sexual morality, or even a
change, except that girls and boys were
more chaste in the ’4os and ’sos: the
smaller figure in the ’4os would normally
be explained by the absence of troops at
the war, but why is the figure only 18
percent in the 1950s?—Korea was not
that big for Australia. However, taking
into account the undisputed fact that con-
traceptives are more in use and abortion
more common than 50 years ago, the
recent figures for first births after less
than eight months of marriage would
only suggest since they are slightly
less than those of 50 years ago—that there
has been some increase in pre-marital
intercourse.
These statistics are similar to some
established in the United States. . The
Connecticut Health Department recently
reported that one in six teenage girls was
illegitimately pregnant last year. Other
American surveys indicate that virginity is
no longer regarded as an important virtue
on the college campus, though it is not
know r n how many students would hold the
view of a Sydney psychologist who claimed
earlier this year that “virginity must be
now regarded as no more virtuous than
malnutrition.”
Being illegal, abortion is more difficult
to assess, but one of Kinsey’s estimations
is that in the U.S.A. abortions among
unmarried women outnumber live illegiti-
mate births by three to one. Applying
this estimate, together With other avail-
able figures from Australia and the con-
elusions of the 1937 New Zealand Com-
mittee of Enquiry into Abortion, the Syd-
ney political sociologist Henry Mayer
guesses that there are more than 50,000
abortions procured by instruments in Aus-
tralia each year.
From these figures one can estimate
that between 25,000 and 30,000 abortions
will be performed on unmarried mothers

in this country this year by instruments
alone. No one knows how many desperate
girls try mustard baths, patent medicines,
quinine, castor oil, pennyroyal, aniseed,
and aloes, or how successful they are or
seem to be.
Incredible as it may seem, the 25,000-
30,000 figure for abortions in the un-
married is accepted as a conservative
estimate by many sociologists and social
workers. Presuming that it is of at least
minimal accuracy and, in addition, that
most abortions are suffered by women
from the ages of 15 to 40, one in 15 of
these unmarried women between 15 and
40 will request an abortion this year.
(The estimate is necessarily crude for
lack of available evidence but it, again,
appears conservative.)
Therein lies whatever significance the
figures have: Unless the illegitimate preg-
nancies keep happening to the same girls
the number of virgins would seem to be
on the decline.
. Some American sexual reporters suggest
that there has been no significant increase
in indiscriminate promiscuity, that
“whoring,” for example, is perhaps even
less common than before, but that the
young, at least, think sexual relations are
legitimate provided that the partners have
real affection for one another, or in the
jargon of the campus, if a “meaningful
relationship” has been established.
Although there are some similar indica-
tions in Australia, there have been signs,
on the other hand, that “whoring” may be
on the increase. Recent reports from Vic-
toria, New South Wales, and Queensland
have suggested that venereal disease is on
the rise among the young. The Victorian
health department now reports that there
had been no significant increase in these
diseases in recent years. But whereas the
Victorian VD clinic rarely treats more
than one or two cases of syphillis, for ex-
ample, per week, in New South Wales the
cases of this disease are now running at
the rate of five to ten per week. The in-
creasing incidence in Sydney is usually put
down to the fact that Sydney is the busiest
port in the country and the focal point
for overseas visitors.
One Sydney social worker says that the
rise in venereal disease is definite evidence
for a change in moral practices (given the
general improvement in hygiene), but the
actual numbers involved are so small as
to leave this open to doubt.
VD incidence may in any case be re-
garded as only significant of the mores of
the sexual underworld and the fringe
groups with which it comes in contact.
Abortion and forced marriage are much
more indicative of sex in the suburbs; so
also is the divorce rate. One thing is clear
since the new Federal Divorce Act: Divorce
is on the increase. Between 1962 and 1963
the number of divorces in Australia in-
creased by three percent; between 1963
and 1964 the increase was nearly six per-
cent; last year when there were 8500
divorces compared with less than 8000 in
1964 the increase was 7.3 percent.
Nearly half these divorces were granted
on the grounds of desertion, and about
a quarter because of adultery. These
figures scarcely suggest that Australia is
just one large coastal Peyton Place, yet
there are signs of a new sexual freedom
in the suburbs, a freedom to which the
decline in church attendance, the wither-
ing of puritanism both in its Protestant
and Catholic forms, the sexual pre-
occupation of the mass media, and -the
general emancipation of women from
economic and social bondage have con-
tributed.
A Melbourne marriage guidance worker
claimed last week the increase in cases
of adultery in the suburbs over the past
ten years was staggering. To the suggestion
that perhaps people were just not so shy
about mentioning it when they needed
marriage guidance these days, whereas
in the past it may have lain as a hidden
factor in many situations protected by the
community’s inhibitions from mention, he
replied. “An experienced marriage worker
can usually tell what a client is too in-
hibited to mention; but one of the big
differences today is that not only will
people mention adultery without prompt-
ing, but half of them do not seem to be
even ashamed of it. With some you feel
that it is almost a boast.”
The new sexual balance
If JHE smaller the, size of families, the
more mobile women will be and the
more they are able to gain some degree of
economic independence, an independence
which must, in those psychologically dis-
posed, lead to an increase in sexual ad-
venture. If the family, religion, and econ-
omics are all losing strength as sexually
inhibiting factors a likely sociological re-
sponse will be an increase in promiscuity
and a decline in faithfulness to one per-
son. The results of this in terms of mental
stability, decline in family strength, and
various other forms of social delinquency,
have yet to be tested. What figures are
available indicate that the sexual revolu-
tion is not seriously undermining social in-
stitutions, whatever influence it may be
having on more intangible matters such
as moral delicacy.
It is, of course, a standard sociological
argument to show that there have been
many forms of sexual behaviour and stan-
dards of marital obligation. We have all
heard of the Trobriand Islanders, of poly-
andry, polygamy, Bali, of Moslem liberal-
ity, and how various kinds of sexual stan-
dards seem to be consistent with an orderly
society. On the other hand, it is signifi-
cant that nearly all societies which have
advanced beyond the agricultural seem to
adopt monogamy and fairly strict public
notions of chastity, and no less significant
that the leaders of the world’s new emerg-
ing forces all want to adopt Western
marriage customs —or what used to be
Western customs.
Surely the basic thing to be said about
human sexuality is that it is both serious
and comic: serious because it intimately
and deeply concerns two human beings and
creates further life: not serious because it’s
a natural pleasure and mostly is not ful-
filled in issue. But treat sex too seriously
or too flippantly and it has a strange power
to destroy.
Puritan cultures have learnt the lesson
of over-seriousness hard; it remains to be
seen whether the later 20th century can
live in a serio-comic sexual balance.

You need more than a driver's licence
to be a Remington technician
No joke. It needs three years training and regular re-
fresher courses. Only then is a Remington technician
allowed even near a customer's machines.
Pretty solid, you might say. But it pays off. The Reming-
ton trainee school turns out the most highly trained team
of office equipment experts in the country.
One particular thing Remington men learn is that a
client hates to be kept waiting in an emergency. That's
why they've built a reputation for being the fastest
qualified experts of this type, on the scene anywhere.
And we mean anywhere ! Remington's service team
has offices in 94 cities and towns throughout Australia.
When you've got more machines throughout the country
than anyone, you need the largest team to service them !
A Remington technician certainly goes through a lot
before he's sent out on the road. But it means that
Remington's clients can forget about service worries. -
What driver's licence could do that for you ?

Sex Offenders
and the Lash
By GORDON HAWKINS
“£IIR,” said Samuel Johnson, “we know the ruffian fears the lash, and there’s an end
U) on’t.” But last week, when N.S.W. Attorney-General, K. M. McCaw, came out in
favor of whipping for sex offenders, it certainly wasn’t the end of it. Indeed, he
and Judge Adrian Curlewis, who had rebuked the previous Government for failing to
carry out his whipping order on a sex offender, found themselves assailed on all sides.
Their ideas were denounced editorially
as astounding, unenlightened, deluded, and
eccentric. Moreover, Mr. McCaw’s col-
league, Minister of Justice J. C. Mad-
dison, having labelled whipping as bar-
baric, anachronistic, and medieval, added,
“While I am Minister responsible for
prisons no inmate will ever be whipped.”
The Attorney-General and Judge Curlewis
however may perhaps draw some com-
fort from the fact that four out of every
five people questioned by the reporters
of one newspaper also favored whipping
as a punishment for violent sex offenders.
When five years ago the U.K. Home
Secretary, in response to public agitation,
asked the Home Office Advisory Council
on the Treatment of Offenders to consider
whether there were any grounds for re-
introducing corporal punishment
(abolished as a judicial penalty in 1948),
of the thousands of letters received by
them 77 percent were in favor of re-
introduction. And a public opinion poll
published in March, 1960, indicated that
74 percent of the population considered
that corporal punishment should be the
penalty for some offences. It is notable
too that the great majority of the judges
of the Queen’s Bench Division led by the
Lord Chief Justice, and the majority of
members of the Magistrates’ Association,
similarly favored the use of corporal
punishment.
There can be little doubt that such ideas
have a strong sentimental appeal here
also; and mental attitudes are largely
based on emotion in this context. In this
connection the nature of Judge Curlewis’s
response to public criticism of his refusal
of a request by counsel to order a sex
offender to receive psychiatric treatment
in jail is significant. He was initially
reported as having rejected the request of
the offender’s barrister to direct that the
man be given psychiatric treatment in
prison. He has since stated that he “for-
got counsel’s request” because he had been
so distressed by the revolting details of
the case. “I was shocked and horrified
by the prisoner’s offences against two
small girls,” he explained. And when a
Judge, who after all must deal with such
matters regularly, can be so carried away
by emotion as to be unable to carry out
a most important part of his function
effectively, it would be surprising if
ordinary members of the general public
were able to preserve a cool judicial
approach to such matters.
The truth is that they rarely do. And
Attorney-General McCaw was undoubtedly
right when he said that there would be
violent outbursts of protest against any
move to abolish corporal punishment for
certain crimes; despite the fact that it was
last used in N.S.W. over sixty years ago.
He was, however, on much more debat-
able ground when he went on to say
that he thought whipping was “an
appropriate punishment in certain in-
stances” and selected sex offenders as be-
ing those for whom it was appropriate.
If by “appropriate” the Attorney-General
had meant no more than “fitting” in the
sense that some kind of “poetic justice”
would be done, his assertion would be dif-
ficult to confute. Although it might be
regarded as fancifully archaic and at odds
with the N.S.W. Government’s declared
policy in regard to the treatment of offen-
ders. But this apparently was not at all
what he meant. For he added that he
“believed whipping was one penalty which
would help control and reform hoodlums
who inflicted much worse pain on inno-
cent woman and children.” And in saying
this he put the matter on a different level
altogether; something which not all his
critics appear to have appreciated.
For the truth is that if Mr. McCaw
were right about this, then all the rhetoric
about corporal punishment being “degrad-
ing and brutalising,” “barbaric and
medieval” would be hardly to the point.
We should in fact be faced with a simple
choice between controlling and reforming
such “hoodlums” or, by refusing to do so,
in effect condoning and even tacitly en-
couraging their activities. In these cir-
cumstances very few citizens would refuse
to give innocent women and children the
protection provided by corporal punish-
ment however distasteful or unpleasing
they felt it to be.
In the circumstances the least one can
do is consider the evidence upon which
Mr. McCaw bases his belief in the singular
and unique effectiveness of whipping as a
method of controlling and reforming sex
offenders. Unfortunately, in view of the
great social importance of the topic, his
published statements on this point have
been exiguous in the extreme. A care-
ful search of the Press reports reveals only
the following brief passage:
“Several years ago there were a series
of sex crimes in Hutt Valley, N.Z.,” he said.
“It was followed by a threatened similar
epidemic in South Australia, where it was
quickly checked by whipping ordered by
the courts.”
Now in the absence of more details than
are provided it is impossible to evaluate
properly this kind of assertion. But it
would be very surprising indeed if the
facts bear the interpretation placed upon
them. For the history of the debate on
the effectiveness of corporal punishment is
swollen with assertions that, at a particular
time or at a particular place an outbreak
of crime was suppressed or checked by the
use of corporal punishment. Yet when-
ever in the past such statements have been
checked by reference to statistics and other
available sources of information it has
been found that in no case were the facts
such as to warrant the confidence with
which the original assertion was made.
In this connection the U.K. Departmen-
tal Committee on Corporal Punishment
(the “Cadogan Committee”), which re-
ported in 1938, went to the trouble of
making a detailed investigation of a num-
ber of the “most persistent” of this type of
assertion. Their conclusion is worth re-
peating.
“After examining all the available evi-
dence, we have been unable to find any
body of facts or figures showing that the
introduction of a power of flogging has
produced a decrease in the number of
offences for which it may be imposed, or
that offences for which flogging may be
imposed have tended to increase when
little use was made of the power to order
flogging or to decrease when the power
was exercised more frequently.”
Since then, of course, the Home Office
Advisory Council have issued their report,
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT (1960),
with the conclusion, based on very care-
ful and thorough research, that “There
is no evidence that corporal punishment is
an especially effective deterrent either to
those who have received it or to others.”
This is not to say, of course, that a sen-
tence of corporal punishment has never
deterred any offender who has received it
or any potential offenders. But it does
mean that, in the face of these authorita-
tive reports, no one can expect to have
dogmatic claims to the effect that judicial
corporal punishment has a special or
unique influence on a particular class of
offender accepted, unless they are sup-
ported by something more than has so far
been offered as evidence.
On the other hand it should be said that
there is no justification for the categorical
statement made by one editorial writer,
in admonishing Mr. McCaw the other
day, that the notion that sexual criminals
can be controlled by physical punishment
“has been refuted throughout the world
by experts.” Actually, the kind of ex-
perimental studies which would be re-
quired in order to enable experts to
either confirm or refute the hypothesis
in question have not been carried
out anywhere in the world. Equally
delusive is the belief that sexual offenders
are especially responsive to psychiatric
treatment. Nowadays few psychiatrists
would make any such claim although in
the past extravagant statements to this
effect have been made. Relatively few

sex offenders are found to have sought
psychiatric treatment before their arrest.
And although understandably a number
do so in an effort to obtain evidence
which will aid in their defence, they not
infrequently refuse psychiatric treatment
after conviction. The truth is that we
know very little about how to bring about
changes in patterns of sexual be-
haviour and there is no evidence that
psychotherapy is any more effective than
corporal punishment in this respect. It
is to be hoped that when the present
controversy dies down the whole matter
will not be forgotten until the next
“SHOCKING SEX CRIME” comes
along. For Judge Curlewis has un-
doubtedly drawn attention to a serious
problem. The case which so distressed
him, it should be noted, involved sex
offences against children. In this con-
neetion a survey conducted by the Cam-
bridge Department of Criminal Science
some years ago (Report on Sexual
Offenders: 1957) revealed that 82 per-
cent of the victims of sexual assaults were
children under sixteen. Another in-
dependent study reported that over half
such victims were under 8 years of age.
The Cambridge report also showed
that although sexual offenders were
amongst the least recidivous of all types
of criminals, it was amongst those who
offended against children that those most
likely to offend again were found,
If we are really interested in protecting
our children it is time we stopped worry-
ing about such things as imposing sen-
tences “as a mark of the community’s
revulsion.” We could also forgo the
luxury of denouncing one another as “bar-
barous.” What is required in regard to
the sex offender is a really large scale pro-
gram of research into treatment methods.
Expatriate’s
Agony
“Don’t Come Over”
By HUGH ATKINSON
THERE are seasons in which any one
place is more pleasant to visit than
at others. Alas, this is also true of
decades. If you are considering a few
ex-patriated years in London, don’t • come
over. Put it off for a bit, say until 1980.
May be you won’t be such a giggle by
then.
In the ’fifties London was a comfort-
able place for Australians. The British,
when they thought about us, and it was
hard to catch them at it, did so with the
most friendly patronage. It was possible
to be called “Digger” by them if you got
among the cockles of their hearts. There
existed a quizzical appreciation for some-
thing hard to categorise. Zoologists feel
like that about the duck-billed platypus.
The Fall began with the ’sixties. Those
British who had immigrated to Australia
had begun sending back in tens of thous-
ands Australian newspapers and periodi-
cals. This constituted what Alan More-
head calls The Fatal Impact. Every gib-
bering antipodean fatuity, so long and
mercifully quarantined by oceans, was
suddenly abroad. From a myth-tinged
obscurity, Australia and Australians were
shot into the light. The last strung bone
in our skeleton cupboard, connected to
its skull, had taken passage for Britain and
clacked and grinned in the streets. For
the Australian expatriate the good old
days were departed. Exposed and
exploded he stood quivering on the
threshold of the decade of the giggle.
Relentlessly the ghastly evidence rained
about us. An art dealer was hauled
through the courts for exhibiting a New
Guinea carving. Lolita had to be got by
university students on special application,
like those prints of D. H. Lawrence’s
watercolors stockaded in the Mitchell
Library. The incredible pronouncements
of our political buffoons as they advanced
dauntlessly into the past, were reprinted
in British nationals for the edification of
the friends and relatives their immigrants
had left at home. The unrelenting per-
secution of an Asian family in Sydney
was underlined on TV newscasts. The
bandaged ladies of Toorak caused
Shrimpton to lower her hem. Then
Channel Seven banned King Kong. A
relationship between a woman and a
monkey is unhealthy, it was reported.
That was the week expatriates locked their
doors and put pillows on the telephones.
As old soldiers finger their scars and
recall in which carnage they got them,
the Australian in London can bare his
chest and exhibit a frightful wound
over the heart, datelined 1963. It is a
wound like that the goanna, leaves
when he had had a piece of you between
his teeth. It breaks out again on anniver-
saries of the bite. Today there are still

those who twitch about the face when
introduced to strange company as Aus-

When all those Royal photographs have
browned and blurred, he will still keep
a place in England’s memory.
Unbelievable bilge which should
have sickened the presses that printed the
Australian coverage of that Royal
tour is a cherished grotesque in Fleet
Street. I know an unreconstructed mon-
archist, the archetype of a peppery
colonel, who insists it was a devilish out-
rage, plotted to ridicule royalty.
On the Lit. circuit one is surprised at
how well informed English writers are
about Australian criticism. They have
noticed on their royalty statements that
they are doing well under capricorn.
Australia is a valuable book-buying mar-
ket. There is, however, no comfort in it.
Australian criticism is regarded as bar-
baric and eccentric. Barbaric because
most reviewers express themselves with
amazing vulgarity and a scintillating
ignorance. Anybody so tone deaf to the
words and sentences they themselves use
can hardly be expected to get the wax
out of their ears and identify grace in
the writers they criticise. Eccentric be-
cause of the frequency with which Aus-
tralian criticism runs counter to world
judgments. This does not include the Aus-
tralian need to knock a fellow countryman,
like the hostility offered Morris West
which became so hysterical it inverted
itself and thus assumed a decent propor-
tion. No, this makes a game to play.
Take any talked-about novel and com-
pare the English, American, French, and
Australian criticism of it. Or better, take
a play or a film if you wish to run into
this oddity with the arresting force of
a dash into a wall. Perhaps by 1980 it
will have been proved that Australian
criticism was in a state of revelation and
you can come over triumphant.
More optimistically, it can be reported
that the Patrick White jokes are thinning
out. The love affair between some of our
shriller literary nit-pickers and Mr. White
and his novels was grossly unfair
to the man. Malcolm Muggeridge calls
it The Patrick White Australia Policy.
Still, it was a thorn in our tender, ex-
patriated sides. It was so hard to get an
edge in wordways about Hal Porter or
Randolph Stowe or Frank Hardy’s stories.
It used to be thought they must be
characters in some novel by White.
Strine
'jyALK Strine was a strain for a time. We
bit on the bullet. John Lennon
helped with “In his own write” and “A
Spaniard in the works,” which is a dif-
ferently twisted same kind of word play.
One did weary, though, sitting in some
country pub, to hear a clay-footed yokel
tell his friends, “Oi thoink ’e be doiking
Strine.”
They called us “gutless wonders” when
the Australian side put up the shutters on
the Test match. But everyone isn’t inter-
ested in cricket, one knew which pubs to
avoid. The hard time came when that
dreadful money was pictured and handed
about. I struggled up an explanation for
the 2-dollar note. “Exports,” I said. “If
the Japanese thought like that,” I was
told, “The Yen would be covered with
condoms and transistor radios.”
There is, of course, no possibility of
explaining the 1-dollar bill. The dum-
dums who worked that one out have got
the ex-patriates over a barrel. Apart from
the' White Australian Policy (the non-
Patrick one) and the unbridled encourage-
ment given the aboriginal to perish in his
own filth, this celebration of their totemics
by a nation mostly sat down on the urban
seaboard in suburbs put up round R.S.L.
clubs, is a non-sequitor on which one dare
not meditate lest the brain flip out of its
pan.
Before you come over in 1980 perhaps
our 1-dollar bills will have been disposed
of to the First Bantu Free State.
You can see how it is. Don’t come over.
Give it until 1980. There’s nothing left
now they’ve sacked Utzon!

The Nazis
THE BULLETIN is able to report to
the nation that the Melbourne Nazis, who
tried to overthrow the Government on
May Day, are growing in numbers each
week and now number seven, not includ-
ing wives and children. They are a Vic-
torian Branch of the Sydney-based Aus-
tralian Nationalist Party and are witless
pawns of Sydney mastermind Arthur
Smith, the Australian Fuehrer. The chief
Victorian cadre is Obersturmbannfuehrer
Holmes, whose lieutenant was formerly
called Clements but now works under the
disguise of Herr von Rand. The Austra-
lian party is in turn affiliated with the
British Nationalist Party which THE
BULLETIN’S agent in England has
tracked down to an address in Prince-
dale Road, London.
The Federal Attorney-General, Mr.
Snedden, and the Victorian Attorney-
General, Mr. Rylah, both promised that
the fullest investigation would be made of
Nazi mass organisations. Last Wednesday
night hundreds of Nazi leaflets were plas-
tered over shop windows and walls in
the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick. The
leaflets measured 6in. by 4in. and carried
pictures of Adolf Plitler under the heading
of “Hitler was right.”
There is evidence to suggest that the
leaflets have already had the effect of
swelling the numbers of the new Nazis.
There is every reason to believe that the
Melbourne Nazis now number eight. And
that does not include wives and children.
The Pill
HOPE for students now resides in the
work of New York scientists who have dis-
covered a memory pill. Laboratory rats
given small doses of magnesium pemoline
recently were able to learn faster and re-
tain their learning longer. The scientists,
who call magnesium pemoline “the
memory drug,” think that it increases the
acid in the brain which causes transmission
of signals from one brain cell to another
and makes the storing of knowledge faster
and more permanent.
The benefits for mankind will be
enormous, although there may be some
confusion at first when teachers enter
classes and order their students to take out
their books) glasses of water and pills,
and settle down to work.
Pidgin
THE SQUARER linguists at the Univer-
sity of Queensland are still trying to find
the right language to describe their senti-
ments about the latest course to be offered
by the University’s Institute of Modern
Languages. Eighteen students have already
enrolled for the course in what is politely
known as neo-Melanesian, but is in fact
pidgin. In 1965 there had been moves
to offer pidgin, but academic respectability
won the day and a course was offered in
Motu. This was not Motu at all, but
Police Motu, a fringe language far less
widely spoken than pidgin. This year
pressure from Professors Lawrence and
Hughes (Anthropology and Government)
has got the course in pidgin started.
The opposition to pidgin was based on
the false assumption that pidgin is broken
English. In fact, pidgin is not only a
useful lingua franca, it is a language with
its own syntax, grammar, and rules. It is
easy to learn the early stages. But the
difficulty comes with the idioms, which
are rich, subtle, and dynamic. New
Guineans are proud of pidgin. This is
something they have given to the white
man. And it is a superb language for
oratory, with its deep ground-base of bibli-
cal sonorities. Just as English absorbed
Latin, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman French,
so pidgin has absorbed and re-processed
English, German, Italian, Latin, Tolai, and
more. It is a language which New
Guineans are increasingly using between
one another to escape from the prison of
a hundred dialects and languages.
The University Institute of Modern
Languages already offers 14 languages
varying from Hindi to English-for-foreign-
students. The new pidgin course is in the
hands of Bill Tomasetti, a Deputy District
Commissioner from the Territory, now
completing an Honors course in Govern-
ment at the University. Missionaries, doc-
tors, and nurses are showing great interest
in the course. And even the pundits are
beginning to feel that pidgin may not
wholly discredit their own academic stand-
ing.

SOCIALISM in Western Australia is now
officially dead. They have even sold the

Sebel’s own main line of business—metal
furniture —but could be any consumer or

Sebel’s will get no direct benefit, but are,
perhaps, not entirely altruistic. They say
that at times they have difficulty in getting
suitable designers for their products and
an award may encourage young people into
the profession. Sebel’s, supplying folding
and stacking chairs, are in a wide-open

A name to all Australian ears curst.
For close designs and crooked budgets fit;
Sagacious, bold, and turbulent of wit:
Restless, unable to save face;

grace.
A fiery soul, which working out its way
Will fret his Welshman’s-body to decay;
And o’er informed the tenement of clay.
A daring Chancellor in extremity;

He sought the praise; was frightened of a

Falsetto
THE OWNER, so the song goes, told
Clarence the Clocker, and the Clocker told
Jockey Magee. The jockey of course passed
it on to the horse, and the horse told me.
At the Annual Warrnambool Racing Car-
nival in Victoria’s lushly pastured Western
District last week, jockey McGinley forgot
to pass on one vital piece of information
to his horse, Falsetto, namely, where the
winning post was. And the stewards fined
him $2OO for it.
Falsetto led for most of the two gruelling
miles in the Brierly Steeplechase and was
12 lengths in front of the field in the
straight when Tom McGinley pulled him
up. McGinley forgot that the winning
post for the steeple was farther along the
straight than the winning post used for
flat races, and, whilst he was slowing his
mount, along came Regalo down the out-
side to beat him by a head.
An added rub for backers of Falsetto,
who started favorite at 9-4, came next day
when a Press photograph of the finish
(there was no official photo-finish), taken
from an angle, appeared to show their
fancy winning by half a length.
Top IQ Verse
MENSA, the society for people with high
IQ’s, has found some poets among its
10,000 members in 50 countries. They have
published an anthology, “Poetry Mensa,”
which includes work by Australian mem-
bers. Of the 56 contributors, “28 are
women, 27 men, and one anonymous.”
(The one Australian poet listed by Mensa’s
Press release is Miss Larch Brade, formerly
Lorna Brade.) Two samples of top IQ
verse appear on the advance publicity
sheet, one by Victor Serebriakoff, author
of “British Sawmilling Practice,” and the
other by Dorothy Margaret Paulin, once
editor of “Scottish Home and Country.”
Here is part of Mr. Serebriakoff’s pro-
test against the unnatural environment of
today’s housewife:
Put her not out where trees claw in
the sun, your woman;
Not let her, naked on the hill, divide
the wind.
Nor not in woods love her. Not in
woods
Under the craning curiosity of leaves.
Love her in equable prisms where
you can finger sudden dawns
Or flick a noon away from the bland
indifference of ceilings.
And here is a sample of Dorothy
Paulins’ chef d’oeuvre, “Spring-Time
by Loch Ken”:
Where, where
Find courage to suffer the on-ding?'
Here. O, here only,
Here in the faith-hope-love of living,
Within the restless bewildering bur-
geoning battling babble of living
Here . . . grows, waits
The stature of serenity.

Conversation Pieces
A CERTAIN amount of double-talk
is inevitable in most occupations, but
very few, if any, have put out a
glossary of terms, as it were, to guide the
uninitiated. Long, hard practice is the
only way to understand this double-talk.
The following translations may prove of
use; all are well tried and tested during
a recent search for a house.
It Needs Doing Up. The bathroom has
cracked walls, a small rust-stained basin,
a bath with claw legs, the lavatory is out-
side, and there is something drastically
wrong with all the other rooms.
You Could Knock This Wall Out. Mean-
ing instead of two poky dark rooms you
have one poky dark room, and if you
have been silly enough to move in before
doing this demolition job all your furniture
will be ruined and you will go out of
your mind.
It Needs a Good Paint. The entire out-
side is of liver-colored brick, arid indoors
it is all a rich gravy color. All woodwork
needs to be scraped down before begin-
ning.
It’s Small But Ready to Move Into.
Quite a lot of houses have been built with-
midgets in mind. One little box leads into
another. One room I saw, very suitable for
an intellectual dwarf, was lined from floor
to ceiling with bookshelves and a tiny bed
had been squeezed in under a window.
I hoped it was for a child.
The Damp Course Needs Replacing.
This is sinister and the signal for immedi-
ate retreat. There are interesting penicillin-
like green patches over the walls in these
houses and huge bubbles in the wallpaper,
which has often been quickly pasted on
before the house goes on the market.
One Minute from the Beach. If you
happen to be Roger Bannister or any other
four-minute miler, this would, give or take
a few minutes, be true.
Harbor Views. We have added an extra
thousand dollars on to the price of this
house because if you stand on one leg on
top of the wardrobe in the top room and
peer out, you will see a patch of water.
Quiet Street. No buses.
It Is Tenanted. There is an old man
upstairs, downstairs, or evert in my lady’s
chamber, who will not budge and has
no intention of budging except on pay-
ment in cash of a lump sum.
Bijou. Cramped.
You Could Put in a False Ceiling and
Make the Room Look Bigger. I will re-
frain from comment on this, as one who
has held the plaster up, like Atlas, while
the said false ceiling was being put up.
Ranch Style. One room leads into an-
other, spread out over an impossible dis-
tance, so that you walk miles to get to the
lavatory.
Handyman’s Special. If you are a handy-
man, you can be busy at handymannery
for the rest of your life, because every-
thing is wrong with this house, from the
chimneys to the foundations.
The double-talk doesn’t stop here. It
probably reaches its highest art-form in
used-car parlance.
Better Than Brand New used to puzzle
me until I realised it means the car has not
been bashed about too much by the pre-
ceding owners and has been sprayed in-
side with new-car smell.
A Good Clean Car. We have vacuumed
out the ashtrays and got rid of the potato
crisps from under the back seat.
One owner, Sunday School teacher; this
car has rarely left the garage except on
Sundays. We have an old souped-up taxi-
cab here which we have put in order as
well as we could and resprayed it.
For myself, I feel the thing to avoid is a,
tenanted ranch-style house, with harbor
views, needing a good paint, in a quiet
street,- and to make absolutely sure that
the car you buy is n'ot “a snip” and that
the previous owner wasn’t a “lady doctor”
or a Sunday school teacher who only took
it out on Sunday afternoons.
NANCY CASHMORE
Furmanship
IN the peculiarly segregated life of
women in Australia, there are few
enough highlights to make the discovery
of another worth reporting. This new
dimension to female living is furmanship,
the experience of living with a fur coat.
First things first, there is no misplaced
gender in furmanship—for furwomanship
doesn’t mean a thing. The first, last, and
all-time important aspect of wearing a
fur coat is the effect it has on a man—
any man, from nought to 70.
Now I, in my innocence, thought I
was buying a coat to keep me warm, and
was convinced by long years of fur copy-
writing that it was an investment that
would safely take me through the vogues
of the space age, the bare look, and little-
girl fashion.
Not so! Being closer than one would
think to the animal it came from, it un-
expectedly bit the hand that worked so
hard to pay for it by involving me in
extravagances of French perfume, facials,
and exotic hairstyling. For the first lesson
in furmanship is if you get a fur you
have to live up to it.
Imagine what it does to the personality
of any well-adjusted Australian woman
accustomed from birth to the comradely
nonchalance of the average Australian man
—to face that sex symbol in her wardrobe
every day.
As she slips it on in front of her mirror
—her hair looks dull and lustreless beside
that glowing pelt. “Must have a hairdo
today,” she thinks and as the softness
settles around her neck . . . thousands
of perfume ads with their illustrations of
dark handsome men breathing into shell-
pink ears whisper their persuasive mes-
sage . . . tabu . . . you . . . you ... so
what else can she do but reach for “My
Sin” and to hell with the expense.
There are many peculiar aspects to
furmanship and not the least of these are
the reactions of husbands. For things be-
ing what they are in Australia, women who
own fur coats usually have husbands. I
understand it is different in U.S.A. and
Europe, but then so are the men.
You might think that as he has paid
for it he would be the first to enjoy it.
But quite the contrary it makes him
edgy. Being a realist, he recognises it for
what it is. One minute there is you —•
the familiar, mother, wife and helpmate—
and then suddenly there is “Eve” —the
other woman.
But it is in the cold wide world outside
the home that furmanship really pays off.
No more will you step unaided from
the tram some man will be there to
help you down. No more will you
struggle to get out or into your coat
men will leap across the room to take
it from your frail shoulders. Fatherly
types will take you by the arm, brotherly
types will pat you on the shoulder.
Nor is this touching an end of the
matter. Any respite you gained from
passes by donning a wedding ring comes
to an end. Wearing a fur coat is like
waving a flag to the older boys. The
day you appear in a fur they decide you
are just the one to help them have a
night on the town.
ESTA HANDFIELD


AROUND MELBOURNE
The Battle of the Sly Bakers
90,000 illegal loaves
OVER the years we have heard some
astonishing stories of undercover
activities in Melbourne on dark,
wicked Melburnian weekends. We have
been told of the use of guns, knives,
and savage dogs used to keep out De-
partment of Labor inspectors. We have
been told of high-speed car chases
through the night. We have been told
of locked doors, of subterfuge, of dis-
guised vans sneaking by devious routes
along Melburnian streets in the dim
early hours. What’s all this about? Is
this an episode of the “Man from
U.N.C.L.E.,” Mr. Napoleon Solo him-
self trying to outwit the agents, of
THRUSH? Oh, heavens no, these are
just tactics used in our most exciting
“underground” battle, the production of
sly bread.
Once before, Mr. Jordon, secretary
of the Trades Hall Council, said: “You
would think I was competing for the
Academy Award for being dramatic if
I told you all I know about what goes
on at these places.” We even called
at one of the illegal weekend bake-
houses. We didn’t see any knives, guns,
or savage dogs as suggested by the
Trades Hall Council. The proprietor
in turn said: “The monopolies don’t
want Sunday baking so they try to close
us.” Why, he even made a charge
that squads of “muscle men” and
“armed bodgies” had forced their way
into his bakery.
There had been threatening mid-
night telephone calls and goons had
slashed the tyres of his truck and pulled
out the engine wiring.
So you see, any good scriptwriter
could pen a perfectly marvellous weekly
thriller with perhaps Leonard Teale
playing the part of a struggling sly
baker and Diane Cilento as the oven-
warm daughter of one of the bread
barons. However, if you are contem-
plating this assignment it might be
wise to fill you in with a little back-
ground. It is said that 90,000 loaves of
freshly baked illegal bread is sold at
milk bars and delicatessens in Mel-
bourne every weekend. This un-
doubtedly is a conservative figure.
Nearly all of it is baked on Saturday
night or early Sunday morning behind
these locked doors we were talking
about. Under the Victorian Shops and
Factories Act all metropolitan baking
is prohibited between 2 p.m. Friday
and midnight Sunday. Between 50 and
60-odd bakeries, mostly run by New
Australians, do this nefarious sly baking.
Oh, they have been fined and fined
and fined. One Sunday morning out at
Reservoir inspectors saw a sight cal-
culated to make the blood run cold:
a man baking bread. For this offence
he was fined £205. Then the same
week at Collingwood, for punching an
innocent stranger in the stomach, jaw,
and nose, another man was fined £l5.
Three times in 1961 the Bolte Gov-
ernment tried to make weekend bak-
ing legal. The idea was ingenious.
It side-stepped the unions by tabling
legislation which would have made, it
legal for owner-bakers to bake bread on
Saturdays. But every time the bill was
defeated by the Country Party. The
regular bakers have protested re-
peatedly against weekend baking, but
the major opponent has been the
Trades Hall Council. It has protested
that weekend bakers use sweated labor
and that the bread is baked under
shocking unhygienic conditions, and
that it is frequently underweight and
over-priced. Last week the Trades
Flail Council moved to cut off sup-
plies to seven of the major weekend
bakers and it was felt that this would
make the weekend loaf disappear alto-
On Sundays we'd better change it
to... “give us this day our
Fridays bread..!"
gether. But lo! It did not. At our local
shop, there were piles of the stuff.
Now, as we go to press, the Trades
Hall Council has called a 24-hour stop-
page for Wednesday, May 11, for a
meeting to discuss the illegal-weekend
baking dispute and we can only hope
that the weekend bakers rally around
and supply us all with fresh bread for
this day.
The fascinating part about the dis-
pute is this: Constantly we are told
that weekend baking is unnecessary and
that there is nothing more splendid than
the modern loaf which stays fresh for
days. The late secretary of the Trades
Hall Council Mr. Stout even said that
he had eaten bread a week old and
found it quite delicious.
Now I must make a confession. For
the past six years I have been a sly-
bread eater. The bread produced by
these New Australian weekend bakers
may be underweight and shockingly
germ-charged, but by some curious
accident it is infinitely more tasty than
the politically clean, pure white bread
baked on week-days. What’s more, we
are infecting our children. Even though
the Trades Hall Council has told us
how inferior the bread is they still
prefer Sunday-baked illegal fresh sand-
wiches for Monday lunch. And
apparently 90,000 Melburnian families
feel the same way.
Now your innocent correspondent
feels that if the bread is underweight
and baked in unhygienic conditions,
wouldn’t it be easier to police these
bakers if their activities were made
legal?
One of the most telling union argu-
ments is that legal weekend baking
would put up the price of bread. Ah,
but the weekend loaf invariably costs
a few moi;e cents anyway. So could we
not also make the sinful Sunday loaf
legally more expensive?
Please don’t get me wrong. Living in
Melbourne over the past few years
has improved no end. We have rid our-
selves of 6 o’clock closing, we have the
TAB” we have Sunday movies, by gad,
and even though not a theatre has
done a single thing about it, it is now
legal to have a drink in a live theatre
between acts. What’s more, the Bolte
Government is now in the throes of
pushing through a bill which will make
it legal for garages to sell petrol at any
hour day or night. So you cannot call
us a bunch of bowser wowsers.
So, now that we may be free to get a
nip of a petrol round the clock, would
it be too much to ask for our daily
bread?

Why do so many businessmen fly TAA?
Because TAA is a successful
business enterprise
TAA is a business enterprise required
to make a profit and pay a dividend just
like any other commercial undertaking.
And people naturally prefer to do business
with sound, competent enterprises.
The Airline is operated by the Australian
National Airlines Commission, in the same way
as a public company is controlled by a board of
directors.
7£% DIVIDEND
TAA has a capital of $15,000,000, unchanged
since 1961.
Out of a net profit for 1964/65 of $1,409,052
TAA’s 7|% dividend to the Treasury absorbs
$1,125,000.
TAA PAYS TAX
TAA is subject to income tax, payroll tax, sales
tax, etc., normally met by other commercial en-
terprises, and has to pay special tax on aviation
fuel and air route charges as well.
In its operation TAA enjoys no special privi-
leges over its competitors. TAA must win every
passenger and pound of air cargo in open business
competition.
JET-AGE EFFICIENCY
The fact that TAA gains the greater overall
share of the competitive passenger market is in-
dicative of TAA’s business efficiency.
The continued business success of TAA helps
to preserve the competition vital to a healthy
airline industry.
BENEFITS OF COMPETITION
This competition guarantees that every Austra-
lian will continue to enjoy the right to choose by
which airline he will fly, or consign air cargo.
Competition also helps maintain the highest
standards of service for Australian air travellers.
Supporters of free enterprise, in placing busi-
ness with TAA, are preserving for themselves
these benefits of business competition in the air-
line industry.
This is one reason why so many business-
men fly on our Whispering T-Jets. Another is that
they simply prefer to fly TAA.

AFTER THE
MOSCOW CONGRESS
of The
Shelepin — Heir apparent
IN his “The New Class” Milovan Djilas
remarks, “It is at the height of its
power and wealth, but it is without
new ideas. It has nothing more to tell the
people.” This total exhaustion of any-
thing to say has never been demonstrated
so clearly as at the 23rd Congress of the
Soviet Communist Party, which ended last
month in Moscow.
It was without doubt the dullest Con-
gress in the history of the Party. It was
also the shortest of the regular Congresses.
And since individual Soviet political
speeches usually require four or five hours
to make a couple of points, five days was
just long enough for a few dozen people
to say nothing. The only motive for hold-
ing the session at all seems to have been
that the present rulers wish to avoid the
taint of illegality, or rather of more than
a little illegality, for the Congress should
constitutionally have been held not later
than last October.
Thus it was almost completely a non-
event. But as Sherlock Holmes pointed out,
it can be significant that the dog failed to
bark. For the lack of any initiatives worth
talking about in any fields signifies a defi-
nite policy—of doing nothing. After the
wild adventures of the Khrushchev era,
which brought no tangible benefit to the
Soviet Union, the ruling group is ex-
hausted and has turned to what seems to
it to be the only alternative — immobilisme .
Khrushchev was wrong in thinking that
his large-scale experiments could save the
Soviet economy. He was not wrong,
though, in thinking that something had to
be done. When a quack medicine does not
work, this does not argue in favor of no
treatment at all. But this is a typical
phase in the final degeneration of a
regime. When problems cannot be solved
by reforms, however striking, within the
established framework, the only choice
seems to be to patch up the old traditional
methods in the hope that they will be able
to cope somehow, and that no unforeseen
crises will occur. Perhaps this accounts
for the quite unprecedented fact that seven
of the Politburo members failed to speak
at the Congress —not wanting perhaps to
commit themselves even to the non-
committal.
In economics and in the cultural field
the Congress marks a reversion to Stalinist
traditionalism. Even on the very short
term, on the shallowest political level, it
represented stasis. Neither new ideas nor
new people emerged. The new Politburo
member, Arvids Pelshe (who started his
career in the Secret Police), is of very
slight interest and that mainly as the
man who enforced a tough centralising
and Russifying policy upon the Latvian
Party in 1959, purging the leading ele-
ments of the Riga leadership. He thus
represents the anti-liberal, anti-concession-
ist bureaucratic self-righteousness now on
the upgrade. The two provincial promo-
tions to candidate membership-—Dinmu-
khamed Kunaev and Petr Masherov—are
unlikely to carry more than symbolic
weight. (Masherov, an old Komsomol
official, has been particularly violent
against writers, artists, “rumor-mongering,”
and religion —the usual syndrome.)
As a result, commentators have had to
make the best of miniscule organisational
changes effected at the Congress: the re-
naming of the leading Party official as
General Secretary, and of the leading
Party body as Politburo, and the rever-
sion to the Stalin style of listing officials
in order of seniority rather than alpha-
betically. The claim was made that the
General Sec.retary-Politburo business is a
reversion to Lenin’s ways. But Lenin ruled
without a Politburo until March, 1919, and
without a General Secretary until April,
1922, just before the practical end of his
career. The readopted nomenclature is
far more closely associated with Stalin.
It might be added, too, that in Lenin’s
time the General Secretary was not the
first figure in the Party. (And indeed,
though equally not the senior member,
there was another post which has not
been revived that of Chairman of the
Politburo.) This accords with the fact that
the Congress was marked by a total
absence of condemnation of Stalin,
and of Stalinism, and by a complete lack
of anything resembling further rehabilita-
tion of any of his victims.
Over the past year or so, there ha s been
a decisive slowing down of rehabilitations,
and they now seem to have ceased. The
recent spate of articles in the Soviet Press
commemorating the 75th birthday of
Sergei Kirov lacked any hint, such as was
seen before Khrushchev’s fall, of Stalin’s
complicity in his murder. A new attempt
is being made to smother the voice of his-
tory.
On the other hand, it has also been
noted that the overt rehabilitation of Stalin
which had been forecast did not occur.
It may be that the pressures brought
almost unanimously by the foreign Com-
munist parties had some effect. If so, we
must presumably regard all the General-
Secretarv-Politburo stuff as the surviving
vestiges of a much larger operation, the
retention of the symbols after the scrapping
of the substance.
Almost all the members of the leading
bodies are now, in the most literal sense,
veteran apparatchiks (with the sole excep-
tions of Alexei Kosygin and Dmitri Ustin-
ov). The main part of their careers has
been in the Party and Komsomol organi-
sations. Ustinov is, of course, Stalin’s old
Minister of the Armaments Industry,
doubtless included as a concession to
Westerners who want to talk about techno-
crats.
For the notion that the USSR is in any
sense a technocracy is entirely false. The
generation of managerial experts built
up in Stalin’s last years, who played a big
role up to 1957 —men like Mikhail Pervu-
khin, Maksim Saburov, Vyacheslav Maly-
shev, Ivan Tevosyan—have no current
equivalents. The Presidium of 1953 con-
tained (among its full members) only two
men whose main career had been in the
Party apparatus—Khrushchev and Georgi
Malenkov (and the latter was a close ad-
herent and leader of the young managerial
class).
But all of the present Politburo mem-
bers have come up through the Party
ranks, except the light industry figure
Kosygin. (Similarly 20 years ago, before
the more technocratic phase in the ’sos,
Aleksandr Podgorny and Petr Shelest were
the only members of the Politburo with
careers originating outside the Party—but
in their leadership positions they had un-
related assignments.)
The retirement of Anastas Mikoyan and
Nikolas Shvernik means the end of any
serious connection with the leadership of
the 19305. (Kosygin remains from Stalin’s
postwar Politburo, but he only began his
spectacular rise in 1938.) We are some-
times told this type of change means we
are getting a new generation that does not
bear, the guilt of Stalin’s purges. There are
several points to be made here. First, most
of the current leadership held positions of
considerable responsibility before Stalin’s
death. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Mikhail
Suslov all rose to their first important
appointments in the extremely vicious
struggle of the bloody purge period itself.
Kosygin, however much an economics
man, is also a politician, and was a full
member of the leading political body in
the postwar period. Brezhnev rose to
rule the Moldavian Republic in 1950 and
became a member of Stalin’s last Party
Secretariat. Suslov has been Party Secre-
tary continuously since 1947. As for the
younger men, Aleksandr Shelepin was a
Secretary of the Komsomol Central Com-
mittee as early as 1943, and he was pro-
moted by Stalin to lead that organisation
during the last and worst period of the
dictator’s life. Moreover, though it is true


The Return
Apparatchiks
By ROBERT CONQUEST
Stalin—Due for a revival
that the older men had throughout been
Stalin’s accomplices at the highest level,
they nevertheless remembered an earlier
period, the comparatively free ’2os. The
newer men are neither more nor less
pure products of the Stalin epoch.
The new Central Committee, apart from
the removal of Khrushchev and some of
his closest associates, shows surprisingly
little change. Many of the old figures are
still there—four more (besides Suslov and
Brezhnev) of Stalin’s Party Secretaries,
Nikolai Mikhailov, Nikolai Pegov, Averki
Aristov, and Nikolai Patolichev; his head
of the Trade Unions, V. V. Kuznetsov;
and other veterans of the ’3os and ’4os
such as Korotchenko and Ignatov.
The reappearance of Kliment Voro-
shilov in the Committee seems, like the
Politburo name change, to be a symbolic
nod to Stalinism. He is the one old Stalinist
who could be brought into the Central
Committee without representing any
political danger to the present rulers. The
London Times fantastically supposes that
his inclusion is a gesture to the officer
corps, saying that he is chiefly known for
building up the Red Army between the
wars. On the contrary, he is chiefly known
as Stalin’s leading accomplice in slaughter-
ing those who were building up the Red
Army. It was only when he fell that the
Army was finally able to secure the com-
plete rehabilitation of its martyrs.
All in all, the main impression given by
the present leadership is its extravagant
third-rateness. The figures who battled for
supremacy between 1953-1957 were power-
ful personalities, and at the same time
they were men with ideas, capable of
forming genuine factions. Khrushchev,
Malenkov, Lavrenti Beria, and Vyache-
slav Molotov all stood for something, and
had their followings. The struggle for
power among the men at present in the
Politburo continues, as it must, but it
appears to have become little more than
the interweaving of petty intrigues one
might find in the offices of an Urban
District Council in Glamorgan.
From the power point of view the Con-
gress seems to represent the success, for
the time being at least, of a Stop Shelepin
movement. The majority seems to have
rallied against him mainly because of his
too obvious personal ambition, rather than
for any policy motive. Nevertheless, it is
plainly he and his associates who repre-
sent the alternative leadership which will
make its bid for power when present poli-
cies run into their next crisis.
It is more and more being said, that
Aleksandr Shelepin was the driving force
behind the overthrow of Khrushchev. And
a grouping which merely looked possible
on the face of it is now being spoken
of in Moscow as genuine and powerful
. . The main impression given
by the present leadership is its
extravagant third-rateness.”
one centring on Shelepin, V. Semichastny
(head of the KGB and chiefly known in
the West for his typical denunciation of
Pasternak as “a pig”), Dmitri Pavlov
(head of the Komsomol) and Mikhailov,
at present in charge of the Press, whose
return to the centre of things last year is
attributed to Shelepin. All of them rose
through the leadership of the Komsomol.
Mikhailov headed it from 1938-52, and
had Shelepin and Semichastny as his assist-
ants during the later years of his tenure.
(He then became Party Secretary and
Head of the Agitprop Department in
Stalin’s last days. Under Khrushchev he
was in the end relegated to be Ambassador
to Indonesia, but he always retained mem-
bership in the Central Committee.)
The Komsomol background is a bad
augury. Under Stalin it was a forcing
ground for informers, bureaucrats and
prigs the most unpleasant of all the
Stalinist machinery with the sole excep-
tion of the Secret Police. (And, as to that,
it is significant that the man chosen to
make the most violent attacks on the
writers at the present Congress was Alek-
sandr Epishev, Deputy Minister of State
Security in Stalin’s last, Doctors’ Plot,
phase.) In addition, the present Secret
Police machine has been controlled by
Shelepin and Semichastny since 1958, and
it forms an important instrument of the
faction.
Even in Khrushchev’s time it was being
used for such undisciplined and provoca-
tive actions, carried out against the official
line, as the extraordinary mustard gas at-
tack on the West German debugging
technician which led to an unprecedented
apology from the Soviet Government.
The current ideas, if such they can be
called, of this Shelepin group can be traced
in the campaign to give Stalin a better
press. As long ago as last August, Pavlov
set the tone, attacking a certain “one-sided-
ness” which had become apparent in atti-
tudes to the Stalin era and which hin-
dered “the inculcation of patriotism, the
correct understanding by young people of
the history of our Motherland.” There
have been many similar complaints—like
the one in Pravda on January 30, in
which the phrase “period of the person-
ality cult” was denounced in non-Marxist.
But it is also true that a powerful speech
in March in favor of most of Stalin’s rec-
ord, by a secretary of the Georgian
Party, Sturua, was severely cut when it
appeared in Pravda. The Stalin revival
has met with political opposition.
Meanwhile, the revival reflects the Shele-
pin attitude. For we can trace little sign
of difference between his tough-line faction
and the other groups in economic policy,
which is Russia’s most critical area. It
is solely a matter of tighter discipline,
stricter control, firmer insistence on the
acceptance of Party prejudices in every
area, an end to the inconsistencies and in-
decisions which have characterised the post-
Stalin attitude to alien and unusual ideas.
Most of the present apparatchiks at
least went through technical colleges when
young Shelepin studied the humanities, if
we take ideology to be one of those.
If he comes to power, his solution would
probably be the Stalinist one of “to hell
with the consumer.” This is thought un-
likely to work in a technological society;
and in any case it would require a stabil-
ised and authoritative despotism. The
more probable prospects are for a cycle,
common in decaying autocracies, between
unworkable repression and unfruitful con-
cession.
Our interim report must be Am Osten
nichts neues all quiet on the Eastern
Front. But stalemate is hardly a possible
solution in the Soviet Union’s sort of
politics.

In those
32 stately floors
246,960 sq. feet
of Ce/dek
Steel decking
In the State Office Block in Sydney,
Lysaght Celdek plays a large part. An
unseen part. Yet it offers advantages
not found in any other flooring systems.
Celdek is a galvanized steel cellular flooring.
It cuts fixing time to a minimum,
eliminates the need for temporary props,
reduces crane and handling time. And
following trades simply “walk in and work.”
All electrical and communications wiring
is carried within the floor. This means
that office layout can be altered easily and
economically at any time—telephone and
power services can be placed at random.
Although you won’t see an inch of
Celdek when the State Office is complete.
Engineers, Architects, Tradesmen,
Technicians and Tenants will never forget
that Celdek is there. It’s a product you
can’t forget. Build it with steel, build it
with strength, build it with Celdek.
Available through structural decking
contractors.

PROPAGANDA
The Government learns its ABC
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
INCREDIBLY enough, the Government
now actually seems to think that the
people have a concern for, and the
right to know, the reasons for its decisions
on conscription and Vietnam.
A cheer and a half for the circular relay
team of Messrs. Holt, Hasluck, Fairhall,
and Fraser; they are now only about a
lap behind the field in the great Aus-
tralian propaganda race and appear to be
making up ground: although one must be
careful of the native Aussie disposition to
barrack for the underdog.
The idea must have hit someone in the
Cabinet team whilst batons were being
exchanged sometime last month. The
dialogue must have gone something like
this: “I say, Harold, old chap (puff). I’ve
just had the most amusing idea about this
Vietnam bruhaha and conscription and all
those noisy bounders who don’t seem to
understand. What about (puff) telling the
people all about it. I mean why we did it.
You know, making a clean breast of
things.”
And so the try was made, tentatively at
first: not too much about Vietnam—
Harold’s trip might fix that up, anyway —
but carefully argued and detailed state-
ments began last week to emerge from
Canberra on the reasons for the introduc-
tion of conscription. To the relief of all
those who had argued that we must be
militarily committed in Vietnam and that
the Government probably knew best when
it claimed it could not meet our commit-
ments without National Service and con-
scription, the Government, it has now be-
come clear, not only knew best but is
able to demonstrate its case convincingly.
Together they answer the following im-
portant questions: Why can’t we send only
volunteer national servicemen to Vietnam?
Why can’t we get our overseas forces from
the present regular army? Why can’t the
C.M.F. do the job? Why can’t our forces
now serving in New Guinea, Malaya, and
Borneo be sent to Vietnam?
The detailed arguments upon which the
Government’s case rests emerge as rather
simpler and more readily comprehensible
that one would have expected and the
basic facts which affect the conscription
issue are easily identified: of our Regular
Army of 24,000, 44 percent have been
under 19 on enlistment and therefore not
available for overseas service; some of
these are not medically fit for combat;
others are near the end of their 3-year
period of service; even as things were we
are very short of a field force for our
commitments in New Guinea and
Malaysia; civilians are being used wherever
practicable by the services; volunteers do
not come forward in sufficient numbers in
an affluent society to meet our present
commitments or for effective military
planning; the C.M.F. must be basically
maintained in case of geographically
nearer national emergency; we must keep
our present units in Malaysia to honor
commitments there; it would be worse
than useless not to integrate national
servicemen into regular battalions.
The question remaining is why, since its
case is now so convincing, did the Federal
Ministry not come good with its basic
reasons for conscription before its oppo-
nents had set up a long lead in the propa-
ganda race?
Why, in an issue of such an obviously
emotional nature, did the Government not
take the initiative before conscription was
introduced and explain the alternatives
carefully to the nation and the reasons why
these were the alternatives? Why did it
have to wait until a nationwide gaggle of
supporters of the enemy, politicians look-
ing for a cause, professors who have never
been right on a major issue in their
careers, and clergymen jaded with religion
and searching for a new conscience-
stimulus, had turned the tide of public
opinion? .
The answer cannot simply be that no-
body in far-away Canberra knew that con-
scription might be an issue Australians
could get excited about, for in the debate
about our participation in Vietnam, where
Federal Cabinet does have majority sup-
port, there are similiarities in the hand-
ling of the Government case.
One must look further for an under-
standing of the Government’s failure to
convince the nation of its full intentions,
and to communicate to the nation the
sense of urgency without which its de-
fence and foreign policy decision must
seem partly arbitrary and capricious.
The most readily apparent factor has
been the naive and limited understanding
which, at least until recently, has charac-
terised typical Liberal thinking on Com-
munism. This has often seemed to be
little more than a kind of Tory horror at
any one who dare challenge the order of
power and property in the Commonwealth.
The extreme wing of Toryism still
seems to imagine that Communists are
villains in dark cloaks who carry smoking
bombs and plant them in the dead of
night. A more common and more danger-
ous Tory is the one whose objection to
Communism is simply economic: The
Communist is just a Socialist who wants
to nationalise the nation’s industries,
therefore it is a matter of capitalist self-
interest to oppose him.
Members of the Liberal Party who have
not shared these attitudes over the past 16
years have usually suffered from another
weakness in their approach to Commu-
nism. They have, on the whole, ignored it
until election time has come around, and
then have mugged up a few facts on
“Unity Tickets” or the lack of freedom of
speech in Russia and used them to beat
up the Labor Party.
Ignorance about the modern strategy of
international Communist movements,

coupled with lack of knowledge of the
modem history of the pro-totalitarian Left
generally, has led to another serious weak-
ness in the Federal Government’s tactics
over Vietnam and conscription.
Too often members of Cabinet have
sounded like men defending a cause
which they themselves seemed to doubt.
Thrown off balance by the organised cam-
paign against them Liberal spokesmen
have lamely, or at the most; academically,
defended their positions, instead of assert-
ing its moral strength and strategic neces-
sity; and they have utterly failed to expose
the weaknesses and hypocrisies of their
opponents.
Why have the Prime Minister and his
colleagues allowed the presumption of
superior morality to be made by men
who are on record as supporters of the
death-dealing Molotov-Ribbentrop pact,
by men who eagerly condemn the slight-
est cruelty of South Vietnamese soldiers
but remained coldly silent less than a
decade ago when Soviet tanks were crush-
ing the lives out of the men, women, and
children of Budapest.
How can the Minister of External
Affairs, Mr. P. Hasluck, hold himself in
negative restraint when men who pro-
claimed themselves admirers of Stalin
(until Khrushchev told them to stop) now
parade their newly found consciences for
public acclamation.
Why should any responsible leader feel
embarrassed before the pulpits of bishops
who would abandon millions of poor and
harassed peasants to worse slaughter,
torture, and imprisonment? or before
men whose finely ground consciences and
moral sensibilities cannot detect the differ-
ences between thieves and Samaritans?
It is a measure of the Government’s
failure that the best speeches in the house
on Vietnam have been made by ALP
front-bencher Kim Beazley, and that an-
other member of the many factioned ALP,
Professor Arndt, has most ably pointed out
that the majority of politically active
opponents of our present policy in South-
East Asia, on balance, “want Communism
to win in Vietnam.”
The Government, of course, has faced
an almost impossible psychological prob-
lem. For most of its 16 years of office
it was led by a man whose heart was with
a disappearing and increasingly irrelevant
Commonwealth, and who was jolted back
to reality by the twin shocks of Britain’s
entry into the Common Market and find-
ing himself, at his last Commonwealth
Conference, surrounded by men with dark
skins, some of whom were openly sup-
porting pro-Communist policies.
The basic facts the Government must
realise are that it cannot depend on public
support for its foreign and defence policies
unless it can communicate to the people
the appropriate sense of urgency on which
these policies are psychologically based;
that it must prepare the nation for its
major decisions and must fully explain
at every opportunity why these have been
made, and that it must become aggres-
sive and commanding in the national de-
bate against the queasy moralisers, pro-
fessional totalitarians, and witlings who
compose, as Professor Arndt has demon-
strated, Australia’s Viet Cong lobby.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
The Lonely Fellow
John Perceval
By PATRICIA ROLFE
ONE swallow does not make a sum-
mer and the early bird probably gets
very lonely. In the same way, one
artist in Canberra does not make a
Renaissance and, according to John Per-
ceval, you can feel very isolated there
indeed.
Melbourne-born Perceval was brought
back from London a year ago by the
Australian National University as the first
of its two-year visiting Fellows. For a
short time he had the company of Sidney
Nolan, who was granted a six-month
fellowship. But Nolan in his term fitted
in trips to New Guinea and Antarctica
and hardly, it seems, had time to unpack
his paints in Canberra.
Since the ANU’s first burst of generosity
“to help the creative arts,” there seems
to have been a loss of interest. No
further fellows have been announced, and,
of course, so far only painting has been
helped.
But the ANU seems to have had re-
markable value out of Perceval. His ex-
hibition at the Clune Galleries in Sydney
was evidence of the good use he is mak-
ing of the studio, house, and $5OOO a
year which go with his fellowship. There
were 29 paintings and one ceramic in the
exhibition, although Perceval, always pro-
lific, said he had finished about 40 paint-
ings and 50-odd drawings in his time in
Canberra. At times he has done 100-odd
paintings a year.
There was also evidence in paintings
such as “Snow in Canberra,” “Swimming
in the Murrumbidgee,” “Lagoon at Wee-
tangera Waterfall,” and “Crossing
Urrarrai ACT” that he has covered the
local ground very carefully.
But Perceval, “the one eccentric in
Canberra,” he calls himself, says that he
and his family have felt very lonely amid
Canberra’s conformity, although one
feels he means conformity of appearance
rathetf than of mind. However, he has
taken the fellowship with the utmost
seriousness. People couldn’t have been
kinder. He is no longer expected to go
to dinner parties or to wear a tie. Last
year he helped to organise an exhibition
of Australian paintings in Canberra and
this year the ANU will show a retrospec-
tive exhibition of his work.
“This sort of fellowship is probably
unique in the world,” he said. “I don’t
have to give lectures. There are absolutely
no strings attached. It is a wonderful thing
for a university to do.”
The reception Mr. Perceval’s exhibition
had in Sydney was also something new
for him. He recalled that after his last
show in Sydney, in 1959, when he exhibited
ceramic angels, the only buyer was William
Dobell (will there ever be an end to the
stories of Mr. Dobell’s practical generosity
to fellow-artists?) and a woman who after-
wards decided she couldn’t pay the 75
guineas and gave Mr. Perceval 50.
The only one of Perceval’s famous
angels in the recent exhibition at Clune’s—
a most uncelestial being standing on
her head was priced at 2000 dollars
and was sold to the übiquitous Harold
Mertz, who took it back with him to the
United States, together with an earlier
example of a Perceval angel, packed in
foam rubber in suitcases and taken as
personal luggage.
The success of his exhibition may have
given Mr. Perceval, whose artistic history
has such deeps roots in the ’forties in Mel-
bourne, a more benevolent attitude to
Sydney. He feels Sydney may now be
“more lively artistically” than Melbourne,
and talks of buying a house on the harbor.
The house, if it eventuates, will probably
only be a home-base for a family on the
move again. Mr. Perceval said the Can-
berra fellowship brought his family back
from London at a time when the older
of their four children were just growing
up and beginning to appreciate foreign
parts. Now they were drifting back to
Europe, and he and his wife, Mary, would
perforce have to follow them. However,
he himself admitted that travel now held
little fascination for him unless it was
combined with work.
“If I see the cornfields of France and
feel like painting them I want to be able
to stop as long as I like, get all my equip-
ment about me and settle down and work,”
he said. “As far as travel and the artist
is concerned, I don’t think it is necessary
for an Australian artist to travel, but I
don’t think it is necessary for him not to
travel.”
Mr. Perceval, from the standpoint of
the mid-forties and with a full 25 years
behind him as a professional artist, feels
he is now “uninfluenceable.” “My own
course is set,” he said, “unless something
extraordinary the modem equivalent of
Rembrandt came along.”
Nor does he have much ambition to be
an influence. He hasn’t seen much of
the younger painters, simply because he
hasn’t been in places where and when
their work is shown. “I rather like the
look of Gordon Shepherdson’s work,” he
“but it’s only by chance that it’s
been on show twice when I’ve been in
Sydney.”
The Pearly Queen
By PHILLIP ADAMS
EVER since Shakespeare mated Bot-
tom with Titania, class war has raged
in English comedy. Lately the aristoc-
racy, according to Coward, Waugh, and
Wodehouse, has yielded to TV’s deserving
poor, and a plump little woman with a
scarf around her hairnet and a mouthful
of malapropisms has become unquestion-
ably first lady of the genre.
This is Irene Handl. Or is it? A few
months ago this perennial Mrs. Mop pub-
lished an extraordinary novel, “The
Sioux,” about a proud but decadent family

of French aristocrats, which can be com-
pared in elegance and subtlety to Lampe-
dusa’s “The Leopard.”
The paradox is partly explained by
Miss Handl’s family. Her father was
Viennese, and after early struggles became
a successful London banker. Her mother
was, Miss Handl told us, a “peasant
aristocrat,” a highly sensitive production
of French yeoman stock (“They had their
own coat of arms”). Irene was educated
at the Maida Vale High School for Girls
and anarchistically left at 14. At that
time she wrote the first chapter of the
novel she was to come back to and com-
plete 50 years later.
I found Miss Handl extremely
evasive about the next 20 years; the period
is simply not available for public scrutiny.
She “helped run her father’s household,”
until, at 35, she entered the Embassy
School of Acting. Then she appeared at
Wyndham’s Theatre as a maid in a play
called “George and Margaret” and her
life as a theatrical domestic began. Since,
there have been close on 50 films and
incalculable amounts of radio and tele-
vision. She has just completed the first sea-
son of her own TV series, “Barney’s My
Darling,” and will do the second on her
return. Currently she’s employed as a
charlady at the Comedy Theatre, where
IRENE HANDL
her expertise extracts an inordinate
amount of laughter from a vacuous script.
But she yearns for someone to write her
a character like Patrick White’s “Cheery
Soul.” The idea of playing a malign old
dear delights her.
I met Miss Handl at her non-
glamorous private hotel. In her floral
housecoat, surrounded by first-night glad-
dies, she looked like everyone’s old Mum.
But after a few sentences you can no
longer accept her at face value. She’s
intense, fluent, and defines people and
ideas in tart, if somewhat private, meta-
phors. Wealthy audience members are
(affectionately) “white hats.” Australian
theatre is full of anonymous men with
“detergent hair.” She loves almost every-
one but enjoys a “tonic hate.” One such
tonic is Malcolm Muggeridge, whose
brand of intellectualism infuriates her.
She regrets the timidity of our theatre
and would like to “melt the aspic” in
which the audiences are set. Peter Sellers
is a genius, but when he’s not playing a
character is “an empty vase.” .
But she’s not much interested in telling
her most unforgettable theatrical anec-
dotes. It’s her novel she wants to talk
about. During her long-running role as
Mrs. Puffin, she told us, she used to wake
up in the early hours and wonder if life
had to be quite so meaningless. Then she
got out her childhood chapter and started
writing. So, in random order, the chapters
were written. “The Sioux” of the title are
the rich, feudal Beniors, a New Orleans
family of intense tribal loyalty who speak
an exotic language compounded of Eng-
lish, French, and ol’ Kentucky. It con-
cerns Marguerite Benior’s efforts to sus-
tain her frail, luminous son who is dying
from a hereditary disease. Imperiously
she drives the boy toward life, but with
a seeming cruelty that alienates her new
English husband. Miss Handl sees this
slow-moving, mesmeric, and disquieting
book as her summing-up of life, and is
now writing a sequel with death as the
theme. “That’s all the writing I’ll do,”
s h e says. “I’ll have nothing else to say.”
Agnostic, she puts her faith in “real
people,” particularly theatricals. She loves
Dickens, adores Coward, dotes on animals,
detests abstract paintings and politics. She
likes Pinter and avant-garde films, but
takes a dim view of -ballet. And she is
determinedly anti-intellectual in her res-
ponses. “I don’t think,” she says emphati-
cally. In which case she must possess a
formidable intuition.

THE performance of Mr. Free’s play
begins with Alexander Archdale,
who acts the character of Hugh
Farthingale, the producer of “Where Did
Vortex Go?”, who in turn acts the char-
acter of Dr. Limbo Hasselmayer in “Where
Did Vortex Go?”, coming on to the stage
and asking the audience whether there is
an electrician present, because their elec-
trician has just had a baby, that is to say
... Of course, there is an electrician
called Alfred Smiles, who by great good
fortune happens to be present every night.
But the night I saw the play, before Mr.
Smiles manifested himself, a practical
housewife in the audience, moved by Mr.
Archdale’s evident distress, called out
helpfully: “Why don’t you ring the
council?” Poor woman, she didn’t know
the difference between illusion and reality!
Claude Vortex is an inmate of the Blue-

a scientist, is a guilt-ridden wreck. He dis-

which smells like roses. His friend Michel-
more accidentally proved the efficacy
of the chemical when he was careless with
a test tube. On top of all this, Emily, his
wife, is mixed up with an action poet
with whose neglected wife, Rose, Vortex
was consoling himself. In the sanatorium
Vortex re-enacts scenes from his past life
with these people.
After the interval the actors, whose own
problems turn out to be the same as
those of the characters they have been
playing, abandon the original play and
decide to have a “talk-out” of their own
personal drama. Hugh Farthingale thinks
this will make good entertainment, but
he ends with a corpse on his hands.
Even the most ardent devotee of the
avant-garde would probably admit that he
has philistine moments when modern
drama seems merely noisy, chaotic, and
tediously obscene; when its violence ap-
pears to be meaningless and its long, bor-
ing conversations seem just like long,
boring conversations; when the confusions
caused by seeing actors acting producers
and stage managers and electricians, actors
acting characters, actors acting actors act-
ing characters, and actors acting spectators
watching actors acting becomes more than
flesh and blood can bear.
But how do you send this sort of thing
up? Do you do it by putting on a chaotic
play which contains long meaningless
speeches and acts of meaningless violence,
and in which, halfway through, the actors
stop acting the characters in the play and
start acting actors being themselves?
Has Colin Free written a clever send-
up of modern drama, or has he written
a clever pastiche of modern drama which
differs from the real thing chiefly in that
it is really chaotic and absurd, whereas
modern drama is not chaotic and absurd,
though in our weaker moments it may
seem so?
Colin Free is clever, inventive, fluent, and
skilful at parody, but I was unable to dis-
cern the shape or inner logic of this play.
Alexander Archdale and his company give
a thoroughly professional performance and
it is to be hoped they will soon have their
own theatre.

MUSIC
A Dying Fall
Sydney Symphony Orchestra Second Sub-
scription Concert. Conductor, Dean
Dixon.
THE Sydney Symphony Orchestra’s
second subscription concert of the
season demonstrated how precarious
our musical resources really are. Last year,
the orchestra was decidedly good; at pres-
ent, it is no more than adequate. One
reason for this may, admittedly, be found
in the conductor. Dean Dixon looks ill,
dissatisfied, and unhappy, lacking in vigor
and enthusiasm, and his control of the
orchestra seemed less firm and decisive
than in past years. Of more importance,
however, is the loss of leading musicians.
Robert Miller, John Painter, Robert Pik-
ler, Harry Curby, and Robert Ingram
have left for good; in this concert, Donald
Hazelwood, Neville Amadio, and David
Woolley were involved as soloists and took
no part in the orchestra’s playing. The
result was indeed parlous and pointed to
the urgent wisdom of the ABC’s plans
for a separate orchestra of trainee-players.
At present, there are simply no trained
reserves to fill orchestral vacancies with
any competence.
In the event, the concert was probably
much better than we had any right to
expect. The soloists I’ve already mentioned,
with J ohn Robertson, trumpet, appeared in
® a 'j l, ’ s 2nd Brandenburg Concerto This
had been substituted for the originally pro-
,t> , ± * r u • r
grammed Bach Cantata, following the can-
°eliation of Herman Prey’s Australian tour,
The first movement was pretty rough; the
trumpet failed quite spectacularly on sev-
eral occasions and the intonation of the
violins was far from perfect. The final Al-
legroj though a great deal better, could
still have been improved in many ways,
The Andante, however, was all one could
wish for.
The evening’s most interesting music
was provided by a “new” work—Stravin-
sky ’ s “Persephone.” Tenor Peter Baillie,
though not as startlingly good as he was in
Britten’s “Illuminations” a few years ago,
managed a difficult score very capably and
Dinah Shearing’s declamation of Andre
Gide’s poetic and highly charged text was
as excellent as was her French. The choirs,
allowing for some weakness in the tenors,
were good and the members of the orches-
tra acquitted themselves surprisingly well.
PAUL FROLICH
FILMS
Zhivago made Lean
Dr. Zhivago. Director, David Lean. St.
James Theatre, Sydney.
DAVID LEAN is one of the most
durable of English film directors.
“Brief Encounter,” which first estab-
lished his reputation, was made some 20
years ago. But looking over his films since
then it’s hard to discern any obvious pat-
tern of development, any personal pre-
occupation. Two Dickens films, then “The
Sound Barrier,” “Summer Madness,”
“The Bridge On The River Kwai,”
“Lawrence Of Arabia,” and now “Doctor
Zhivago.” Almost their only common
denominator is their technical accomplish-
ment.
In the two films which appeal most to
me —“Great Expectations” and “Oliver
Twist” —Lean was working with strong,
articulate scripts; the larger-than-life qual-
ity of Dickens’ characters made them
vivid enough to be foolproof even for a
much less accomplished director. All Lean
had to do was photograph and present
them—which he did remarkably well.'
Lean’s inability to convey a heroic
character shows up badly now that he’s
graduated to blockbusters. When put in
tremendous situations, Lean’s characters
have a tendency to rattle. This was less
obvious in “The Bridge On The River
Kwai,” since one of Pierre Boulle’s argu-
ments was that heroism is often forced on
unlikely people. But Lean missed out
badly with “Lawrence Of Arabia.” What-
ever Lawrence’s faults of vanity, stubborn-
ness, and romantic woolliness of thought,
he was undeniably a great man, whereas
Lean only managed with the help of
Peter O’Toole’s prancing performance
to give a picture of a posturing, affected
nincompoop.
The same failure to put across any
feeling of human greatness is depressingly
apparent in “Doctor Zhivago,” a pains-
taking, handsome, and, I’m afraid, rather
wearisome translation of the novel to the
screen.
“David Lean’s film of Doctor Zhivago”
announce the credit titles, with the
deprecating addition in much smaller
typeface “From the novel by Boris Paster-
nak.” The reduction of the book is deft,
but so ruthless that the continuity is often
lost; since great chunks of the characters’
lives have been excised, one can hardly
blame the actors for not making their
roles very convincing.
Yuri Zhivago is a doctor-poet who lives
through the Russian Revolution commit-
ted to nothing but goodwill to men and
his own burning faith in life and human-
ity. He himself is the symbol of the
tenacious human spirit. Omar Sharif’s
lacklustre performance in this central role
is a major fault, and it is largely due to
him that the love scenes are singularly
devoid of fire and conviction. No criticism
is implied of Julie Christie, who does
bring some feeling of passion to the film,
or indeed of Geraldine Chaplin, who
struggles bravely with the role of Zhivago’s
improbably understanding wife.

TELEVISION
Be a Sport
NOW that Bob Crosby is leaving us,
there is bound to be a search for a
successor, possibly both by Channel 7
and Willard King Productions, which
“packaged” Mr. Crosby so lamentably.
Is there really enough talent to go
around? Or to make a well-balanced
show? And, if not, what other material
is readily available? Sports and their per-
sonalities could be a partial answer.
In any week there are dozens of sport-
ing events in every city. Action abounds.
Has no one learned from the Olympic
films of past years? Or, contrarily, from
the televised meets of last summer, how
dull sport can be, treated in the ordinary
way? As for personalities, few are as in-
coherent as they appear when thrust in
front of cameras and audience and ques-
tioned. The “step up here and I’ll ask
you a few questions” briefing is insufficient.
Obviously a rapport between compere and
“talent” is needed, and that requires time.
We heed a good sports show on tele-
vision, with interest for men and women,
with brief well-edited film from all States.
It is my belief that men, women, and
children in the various sports would be
of greater public interest than much of
the talent now served up on the night
shows.

RECORDINGS
The British Muse
The Poet Speaks. British Council. RG 450-6.
$7.75 each record.
THE British Council in Sydney has
recently made available a set of six
long-playing records, making up a
total of close on 12 hours of British poets
reading their work. This indispensable
compilation was prepared with the help
of the Poetry Room in the Lamont Lib-
rary of Harvard University and edited and
prepared by Peter Orr.
The set makes interesting comparisons
with the ABC’s own collection, made seve-
ral years ago. Perhaps due to the hap-
hazard circumstances of the recordings,
few of which appear to have been done
under fully professional conditions, the
ABC made a very poor fist of its work.
The quality of most of their pressings is
abominable, and traffic noises, children’s
voices off, and all kinds of distracting sur-
faces frequently ruin the voices, none of
which appear to have been guided in pres-
entation by an expert. Thus, Judith Wright
appears unendurably shrill, when those who
have heard her speak in public talk of a
pleasantly modulated voice; elsewhere, too,
the set has the air of a rather desperate
improvisation.
Mr. Orr, apparently, was engaged on a
full-time basis to make the British Council
recordings (the lady who worked for the
ABC was, one gathered, doing the job on
her own time and partly in her own home).
The quality throughout the six British discs
is remarkably even, only a handful affected
by an imbalance of level. There are, ad-
mittedly, omissions: Philip Larkin, Charles
Causley, Martyn Skinner, Jon Silkin, Hil-
ary Corke, and James Kirkup are only
a few of the names not represented. This
whole set is, in fact, less comprehensive
than its Australian equivalent, even though
it is incomparably better presented.
The overall impression of the poets is
surprising. One had tended to think of
the prevailing tone of English poetry as
one of glumness, a drab contemplation of
the urban wilderness. Instead, there is a
striking continuance of the Georgian tradi-
tion. If the language has been cleansed
of vaguenesses and inept lyricisms by the
influence of Eliot, then the subject matter
—the countryside and one’s personal re-
sponse to its beauties and challenges—•
seems to have survived to a remarkable
degree.
On the whole, it’s clear that the modern
movement has had little more impact in
Britain than it has had in Australia. The
feeling throughout is slightly tired and
anachronistic, slightly limp and faded, as
it tends to be here. Peter Porter, in his
characteristically self-denigrating Aus-
tralian foreword to his own “English”
poems, talks of the “dying fall” in Austra-
lian poetry as though it were uniquely
of this continent; it is very much present
in the quietly relaxed musings of Laurence
Whistler, John Press, and Vernon Wat-
kins (the tone so relaxed in Mr. Press’s
case as to border on banality).
Among the youngest generation of poets
—those between 30 and 40—it is disap-
pointing not to be able to hear Geoffrey
Hill and Christopher Middleton, both
of whom have been exploring the language
interestingly. The most talented of the
English poets of that age group, Ted
Hughes, is strongly represented, however,
and his firm, clear voice expertly delivers
the assured, polished poems; his former
wife, the late Sylvia Plath, incongruously
lends an American touch to the proceed-
ings.
My own chief interest lies with the older
generation of English poets, whose easy
and calm readings contrast here agreeably
with the irritatingly pugnacious yet brittle
poses of the young. Mr. Whistler’s evoca-
tions of mirrors and furniture has a most
charming, slightly 18th-century air. W. R.
Rodgers and David Jones display air
amiable eccentricity, a kind of unsophisti-
cated drive and power that are very re-
warding. But the best reading of all is
by John Heath-Stubbs. Remembering the
incredible frailty of this poet, I was
astounded to discover (or rediscover) that
he has a wonderfully crusty, grumpy,
growling, lower-register voice, with the
harsh tang of a good cheese.

One Suck Morning
(For Ronald McCuaig )
By ROBERT D. FITZGERALD
This was the way my father told the story:
Stopps, his own father’s colleague and good friend
and years-long fellow-traveller on the ferry
whom, old and chair-bound, I, too, call to mind,
was all his life short-sighted, almost blind,
but in his youth, each morning of the week,
spry for an early swim in Tarban Creek.
And one such morning but my father’s tales
were not what maps or calendars could tether;
they had the freedom of all New South Wales
plus half a century of hither and thither
to leap across, and were not held together
in any sort of order or consistence,
though worth your hearing if you stayed the distance.
His method is my model at this moment
my precedent because I think it fair,
telling his yarn, to interject and comment
as he would do, and give opinions air
or bring in anecdotes from everywhere.
Moreover, though there’s virtue in compression
the turn comes round at times for some digression.
So, as to Tarban Creek, it stirs there still,
much as through time, a small romantic reach
split from the Parramatta by one hill;
but where the bridge and new expressway stretch
over it, they reduce it to a ditch
under a culvert; and thereby the past
ebbs down that tideway and seems lost at last.
It might be argued that no ebb is loss;
the many wandering waters will return
in some unreckoned fashion from the toss
of those renewing seas for which they yearn,
and, past the power of reason to discern,
this could be time’s whole pattern. Nevertheless,
what momentarily has gone leaves emptiness.
My father thought so, facing the double void
of days and memory; for life had sifted
out of those days most things he had enjoyed
vigor, old scenes and little could be lifted
from memory either when so much had drifted
thence as might leave it vacant; and the deep
nothing of night could soon have all to keep.
Something should be withheld against the thought
struggle existed only to exist
not to achieve; so could not gains be brought
back from old years? And in his round, full fist
he set down facts recalled perhaps a list
of trivial value in its choice and range
yet items dragged from smothering under change.
Change he acknowledged needful at some whiles
dislikeable, however, to tell truth.
“Look,” he would say, “at rooftops of red tiles
spreading from here to Mosman like a growth
soiling the bird-filled bushland of my youth.
I liked the birds; but what has been has been . . .
You’d never believe the changes I have seen.”
Nothing to changes since! Though what had most
owned him resigns him least. Could he return
this estuary would surely claim his ghost;
his records make of it his grand concern.
And he would know its voices: grunt and churn
of tug-boats, hoot of colliers, clang of steel
and shipyard stutter of some riveted keel.
This Parramatta, so-called River! Yes,
features are disappearing not a few
which I myself remember. Nevertheless,
between the five stone docks and Cockatoo
he would find many landmarks that he knew
despite the blots and scars of the despoiler
and Boiler Point without its old red boiler.
Continued overleaf


But the old ferries of his tales had gone
to breaker-gangs or seaweeds long before
his telling of them. Pelican and Swan
I knew in boyhood just as names, no more,
now seen as written words. The words restore
paddles and beaten foam; but what engages
my heart is how his voice has filled those pages.
I hear, not read, how when the Womerah raced
the Emu on the evening homeward run
her tactics were to hug the craft she chased
while schoolboys, crowding over for the fun,
tilted the larger Emu, which on one
hilarious occasion overlapped
sponsons that way, and held her rival trapped.
So Emu dragged; and Womerah reversed;
and Jeanneret, who owned the Emu, jeered,
and Joubert, Womerah’s luckless owner, cursed
and shook his fist where Jeanneret appeared;
and Captain Mance (my childhood hero) steered
the Emu thrashing on, and pulled his foes
half a mile up the river from Long Nose.
The legal bigwigs playing mental chess,
without a board or pieces, missed a move,
their concentration ruined; and no less
the Glee Club suffered: members dropped a stave
practising “Little Binks was crossed in love,”
while gallant gentlemen composed alarms
of ladies fainting in selected arms.
“Great days!” my father wrote. All days are good
that open and are doors, and doors were wide
in the old Irish-careless home that stood
above a fringing cliff and riverside
put there for youth and nature to divide
between them as their province, and extending,
surely, past any hour or mile of ending.
Below the house there was the coaling station.
I well recall the donkey-engine bustle
of baskets filled and winched up in rotation
out of the belly of some coastal vessel,
then trundled back on rails along a trestle,
tipped and returned and lowered, keeping steady
the clockwork count:, one up, one down, one ready.
The ferry wharf adjoined the coaling jetty
and that free spectacle; but few of all
the early quota heading for the city
would have the time to watch it. Down the hill
they ’herded as if mustered by the bell
on which one Stanner used to beat the message
of the boat sighted in its western passage.
These were but some; others made up the tally:
the Tarban Creek contingent. They were rowed
down from their frontages by Lawrence Kelly
packed in a skiff to be transhipped: a load
of Oxleys and the like, with names bestowed
which the great gossip, history, still drops,
and no, I have not forgotten A. J. Stopps.
But on the morning I have most in mind
good Mr. Stopps was absent. And remarks
were passed on this. They missed his likeable kind
a man to set your watch by. And young sparks
piust have their jokes, of course, and talked of sharks
and tasty swimmers and such nonsense-matters;
for few those days thought sharks were real man-eaters.
This is what happened certainly disaster
though not of teeth-torn wounds. There was a yacht
buoyed at the creek’s mid-stream, a trim two-master,
and round this beacon from the quiet spot
where they had stripped, a little naked knot
of swimmers would perform at early morning
their side-stroke rite of splashing and returning.
And Stopps was mostly one of six or seven,
but swam alone on this particular day.
I said he was short-sighted; so that even
swimming he wore his glasses tied to stay
looped round his head in some ingenious way.
Well, you have guessed. Shortly the string worked free;
the glasses dropped, and he was Lost at Sea.
Completely lost. He had meticulous eyes
for the firm work on paper and on stone
which has outlived him; but should need arise
to look at distance, or with glasses gone
to look at anything, no shape seemed known
in the blurred world that walled him in, where sight
fumbled through drifts and colors of mere light.
So he swam round about, a trifle flustered,
not finding yacht or land, then chanced on shore
among small boulders, rough, and thickly oystered,
and felt his way among them here and there
slowly to safety, but not knowing where.
Upon which bank perhaps? And if his own,
where were the clothes he left? upstream or down?


It is a characteristic of our creek
that it lacks beaches; steeply the bank each side
drops to the water’s edge without a break;
only a narrow strip is bared by tide.
Cliffs overhang; and nowhere could one hide
if one had reason to desire evasion
of public sight, like Stopps on this occasion.
Some time must pass, then Stanner’s bell would sound
its waterfront activity; and yet
here was dilemma: should he then be found
embarrassment and laughter must be met;
but if not found how could he hope to get
out of this bad predicament? Meanwhile
peril approached in more immediate style.
Rescue might come in the good friendly shape
of rugged Larry Kelly who was due
on his first up-creek journey; but escape
could not be made that way as Stopps well knew.
No, he must rather hide, the skiff in view,
because on that first up-creek journey Larry
would have his lady passenger to carry.
The lady infant-teacher from the city
out of the Sydney dawn! Alas, Posterity,
I cannot say if she were bright and pretty
or tough and with a tongue of some asperity,
a model of deportment and severity.
In either case genteel old-painting gestures
would hardly serve him there for bathing vestures
Unknown then, like the sharks! Poor Stopps could hear
the rowlocks and the plod of Larry’s oars.
He was no ostrich, could not disappear
by burying his head bent down all fours.
What shelter here but boulders and his prayers?
So he lay flat behind a stony cluster
with not much hope of being thought an oyster.
Larry rowed up, came close. The delicate chatter
of a sweet female voice should please the ear
floating over the calm of morning water . . .
Stopps didn’t think so as that voice drew near
while he lay deep in mud and soaked in fear,
since any moment now that chatter might
tear at the outraged air with screams of fright.
The seconds dripped their torture. Larry took
a steady onward course; and soon the sounds
distantly waned. Either she did not look
or she too could not see beyond her hands.
So she moves on to blackboards and school grounds;
but Stopps had still a cliff to climb, blind scramble
naked through scrub, and then by guess or gamble.
Which way? At least the heading of the skiff
told him he stood on the same shore as home.
Then a small fissure legged him up the cliff,
all bruises, but with one stage overcome.
Instinct should say where next, but it was dumb.
To right? to left? He pushed through where back-lashing
vindictive tea-tree best gave way to bashing.
And he emerged. Immediately retreated;
this was familiar ground; he must go stalking.
His house was just uphill, a trip completed
normally in three minutes easy walking,
but nakedly a feat to set folk talking.
So, with respectability as a burden,
he dodged and doubled through his own front garden.
He made it, through a window. Dressed and dapper
was soon his tidy self. And no one saw
luckily not his wife who, very proper,
would have poured blame. One time she flayed me raw
about my manners or some childish flaw.
Gall this deserved: it still leaves cause for doubting
her pleasure had she seen his fine boy-scouting.
I think of a frail old man whom she watched over,
gentle, in carpet slippers, out in the sun,
padded against cold winds, but can recover
from such a picture little to show me one
of the same man in an old day that none
living remember. What I have I join
as worn impressions both sides of one coin.
And it hard also to reconcile
bodily strength, mind’s growth, and skills attained
laboriously, with knowing what brief while
these are in one life’s holding then distrained.
Though fix all good, then no more can be gained.
Where turn? With strengths too equal, skills too deft,
one might not know the right hand from the left.
Nor could there be renewals, or a dream
continuing elsewhere past the dreamer’s days,
should permanence made perfect pond the stream
of human triumphs and the heart’s dismays.
Yet, for enrichment, thought may sometimes gaze
on happenings now stilled that half persist
and origins that fade like ships in mist.


BOOKS
The Twinsof Terminus Road
By CHARLES HIGHAM
The Solid Mandala. Patrick White. Eyre
and Spottiswoode. $3.25.
FROM the deserts and suave period
townscapes of “Voss,” and the dazz-
ling country light of “The Tree
of Man,” Patrick White has moved in
parts of “Riders in the Chariot,” in many
of his stories, and now, most notably, in
“The Solid Mandala” to what looks like
being a permanent imaginative residence
in Sarsaparilla, that threatening suburb
which he has peopled with human beings
in retreat from life, their houses threat-
ened by bulldozers or grass, their feeble
attempts at re-creating European embel-
lishments —a pleasure-dome, a pediment
over a door —foundering inevitably in
the sub-tropical, sombre thrust of Aus-
tralian vegetation.
For White, nature presents a constant
threat to the civilised; and in Sydney
he sees the bush moving in through the
cracks, destroying pretentious hopes. His
new novel is full of images of dust, flies,
swallowing grass, mice riddling leather,
dogs rotting, slugs crawling on to paths;
the threats are evoked constantly in images
of great power and ugliness.
This is, perhaps, the blackest of all
his works: in it, he presents a world as
rotted, as corrupted as Ingmar Bergman’s
or Tennessee Williams’, with an additional
edge in the observation. This is, at base,
a Gothic horror sto-ry, its theme reminis-
cent of both Edgar Allen Poe’s “William
Wilson” and that neglected novel “I am
Your Brother.” Its protagonists are twins:
Waldo is dry, thin, and introspective;
Arthur is fat, apparently “simple,” but
full of joy in living, another to add to
Mr. White’s growing list of Divine Fools:
once again, one sees the influence of Dos-
toevsky’s “The Idiot.” Waldo is horri-
fied by his sense of involvement with his
brother’s blood and flesh; he detests proxi-
mity, and the presence of this other self,
like a flabby figure in a distorting mirror,
torments him constantly, much as the
body’s demands agonise finer minds. But
Arthur, Mr. White tells us, has the secret
of life which Waldo can never find, for
all his intelligence. In his pocket, Arthur
carries a marble, which contains an irides-
cent twined spiral, the symbol of perfec-
tion, of the blending of all things which
the Tibetan Buddhists saw as a circle
within a square within a circle. For
Arthur, this has a sexual significance,
among other significances: he himself is
evidently bisexual, the male and female
halves of his nature so perfectly balanced
that he can love all things while not
needing direct physical love. In his pocket
is the world: all things held together
in perfect balance. It is an image Mr.
White explores in great complexity of
detail.
The main section of the book—and its
most brilliant and sustained achievement
—reflects the feelings of Waldo, his
reminiscences of a lifetime spent in Ter-
minus Road from the time that his
parents, the sad half-intellectual bank-clerk
father and the mother who had married
beneath her, came out from England
with their odd twin children. The
whole of this long account of Waldo’s
life, although told in the third person,
is colored by his own warped and evil
vision. He sees the hot brown box of a
house settling in the steamy grass; a train
is “spidery”; a slug haunts a pathway; his
father at the bank is trapped in a claustro-
phobic cage; the skin of priests “flourish
like mushrooms”; a woman’s breasts seen
through a window have a “yellow-waxy”
tint; dogs have stump teeth and bleeding
gums; he thinks of a “herd of human
beasts.” A tennis party is described with
feline malice; a Jewish family does not
escape the cold steel thrust of Waldo’s eye.
It is all finely achieved: the obscene up-
holstery of a train carriage, the preposter-
ous airs of Mrs. Musto the Fairy Flour
heiress, Mrs. Feinstein, wife of a music-
shop owner, with her face made of flesh
like that normally kept private, snobbish
memories of Europe (“I have heard many
of the greatest performers . . . achhh—
yes!”), and a voice smelling of old plush;
Mr. Feinstein with his pompous windbag
phrases; the horrors of the old Sydney
Public Library, books “clotted with soot,
smeary with spittle and nicotine” in an
atmosphere full of the smell of decaying,
aged flesh; the nightmare of watching
bread being made, tatters of dough leprous
and webbed; even Dulcie, the one human
being he finds rewarding, flourishing an
obscene encroaching moustache . . . and
the man she marries, designed for clubs
if he had been admissible, the vulgar,
broad-shouldered Jew Leonard Saporta
(Mr. White has a Dickensian flair for pun-
ning surnames) is again a portrait limned
with the dark colors of hate. Waldo’s
finickiness, his intellectual’s distaste for the
grime of reality is beautifully suggested.
The latter part of the Waldo episode is
full of unforgettable symbols of destruc-
tion, of the horror of distintegration of the
body, of old age. I can’t at once think of
any other book which conveys this horror
so forcefully. First, the old parents rot
and die, varicose veins showing up on the
flawless legs of the sub-aristocratic mother,
announcing her end. Waldo and Arthur
move into their parents’ bed. The house
The Bear Prince
A cave in Hyperborean forests old:
Let’s enter it. There Beauty dwells,
A wise girl, graceful, neither frump nor
scold,
Arranging berries in small bowls
And waiting for the Bear, the Bear to
come,
Her magical husband lumbering hot and
gmm
Out of the wilderness he plods all day.
She fries brown rissoles for his tea,
One eye upon the clock, humming a gay,
Sad song—“Be true, be true to me . .
The cave door darkens and the Bear shoves
in,
Wet, shaggy, gruff, with burrs upon his
skin.
“Bad Beast, your coat is tangled like a
mat.”
“Beauty, your heart is like a dove.”
“O silly Beast, what do you mean by
that?”
“I love as only Beasts can love.”
“Dear Beast, be good. I love your golden
eyes.”
“Beauty, with you this cave is paradise.”
They eat their rissoles then. The story,
though,
Implies she would prefer a Prince
For marital equality. Quite so.
Those barbarous jaws must make her
wince;
Try as he may, his brutish intellect
May win her pity, never her respect.
Thrice happy change! The spell is lifted
now;
The ointment of salvation bums.
The light of manhood flickers on his brow;
The beast-coat tumbles to the ferns . . .
It does not matter how it came about.
She has her Prince. Love’s nightingale
devout
Stretches a cherub’s throat to grace her
joy!
I wish the story ended there:
A Beast made human, happy girl and boy
Climbing in light a marble stair;
But there is one thing no one bargained
for
The beast-skin tangled at the blind cave
door.
Where is the golden mirror of his eye
In which she walked so long, so long,
And watched her petalled virtues multiply?
Poor Beauty lies in prison strong,
A palace-prison; hears the lattice creak;
To please her Prince learns algebra and
Greek.
And he has found her yes, a trifle
cold
For soul is dubious at the change
And flesh is frugal, hard to be cajoled.
When night pulls back the palace hinge
Alone, apart she lies, hopes for the tread
Of animal paw, red tongue and matted
head.

crumbles, grass moves in. The dogs be-
come fleabags, lifting their legs to chairs.
The two men eat vile mutton dishes.
Arthur (apparently) makes love to Waldo,
perhaps in an attempt to force him at
last into physical reality. And Waldo, at
the end, is seized with killing hatred, a
hatred which consumes him and destroys
him as it has been destroying him from
the beginning of his life. He is eaten, in
a Tennessee Williams-like finale, by a dog.
After this overpowering evocation of a
diseased and stricken imagination—per-
haps the most disturbing passage in
White’s whole body of work—the second
part of the book, in which the same story
is seen in Arthurian colors, comes as a dis-
appointment. Brilliantly successful with
Waldo’s evil world, Mr. White cannot
make us see Arthur’s vision: a vision
of goodness suffused with the light
of love. Arthur’s dance of the man-
dala, though written with great skill,
does not convince or come off, nor
does the device of his giving the
marble symbols to the “good” characters,
and being significantly refused by Waldo.
Only in the very early stages—in a pas-
sage about a rounding of Cape Horn when
the twins first come to Australia —
followed by the exquisite description of
Arthur’s dream of the icebergs, can the
reader receive a total sense of Arthur’s
mystical perceptions.
I hope I have conveyed that, despite its
weaker second half, this is a triumphant
work. No other novelist writing in Eng-
lish today has anything approaching Mr.
White’s rich sensibility or his absolutely
firm and unshaken dedication to his own
vision. His insistence on adhering to his
own world, to his own mandala, is the
unmistakable mark of a great artist. Even
when his mannered style is at its thickest
and most Germanically daunting, his blaz-
ing vision dazzles. His Sydney is a far
cry from any I know: a hell of sweltering
undergrowth, of collapsing roofs and hopes,
of lost people being consumed away. His
young people never really seem young;
only his old, crabbed men and women
come horribly to life. And even Arthur,
whose vision we are asked to feel for,
whose portrait is as near to being con-
vincingly sympathetic as any in Mr.
White’s gallery since Laura Trevelyan in
“Voss,” does not seem beautiful or divine.
This is a book whose evil flavor repels me;
but I cannot deny its overwhelming force.
I must not end this review without com-
menting on Mr. White’s startling humor.
Black and cruel, it is no less sharp here
than in “Riders in the Chariot.” The
tennis party given by the flour heiress is
wonderfully evoked, of a Firbankian ele-
gance and polish; Waldo dressing up in his
mother’s clothes is as macabre-funny as
anything in “Psycho.” The brief portraits
of Leonard Saporta and Honor Glasson
(whose short stories appeared, we are
waspishly told, in THE BULLETIN) are
piercingly exact disclosures of two kinds
of pretension and stupidity. Above all,
Mr. White’s picture of certain kinds of
tired English people in his evocation of
the twin’s parents —mildly liberal, con-
fused, vaguely class-conscious —is precise,
humorous, and, for once, even a little
tender.
I do not share 'Mr. White’s vision and
have to reach a long way to grasp it.
That vision has seemed to me thinned out
in some recent works. But here it again
flourishes, in images of destruction that
have haunted me for days. In a leaden
period, when the novel is dominated by
smart opportunists, this kind of pain in
reading is most welcome and most rare.
Ashbolt against America
By DOUGLAS McCALLUM
An American Experience. Allan Ashbolt.
Victor Gollancz and the Australasian
Book Society. $3.
WE are all familiar with the anti-
semite who prefaces some fresh
anti - Semitic innuendoes with the
remark, “Some of my best friends are
Jews,” or with the anti-Catholic who
begins, “Of course, I’m not bigoted, but
the R.C.s are everywhere, you know.” A
recent tactic for some of the political left
in Australia, especially concerned to
undermine resistance to a Communist
seizure of power in Vietnam by playing
upon endemic anti-Americanism, is to dis-
arm criticism by insisting that they are
not, of course, anti-American. It’s only
that they can find no good at all in
American society or in any American
policy.
Although your reviewer is frankly pro-
American, some of his best friends are
anti-American. But Mr. Ashbolt won’t allow
even his best friends to represent him as
a case of anti-Americanism. After a
struggle in 1957 between the News and
the Talks departments at the ABC over
which was to nominate the ABC’s special
correspondent in New York, Talks won
and ]yj; r Ashbolt was there from May,
1958, to July, 1961. Many of us who
listened to his ABC talks from America
felt that they had a decided slant and
that they were irritatingly anti-American.
Mr. Ashbolt is aware of this kind of re-
sponse: “I often find myself accused of
being anti-American. Oddly enough, the
charge is levelled at me more often in
Australia than ever it was in America.”
So Mr. Ashbolt begins the book with an
apologia designed to show how silly it is
to apply the label. He also ends the book
with two sentences which I, as a pro-
American, could dearly wish to have
thought of: “The civilised Western man
of yesterday had two countries—his own
and France. Today his second country
is not France, but America.”
Ashbolt’s argument is that it is impos-
sible for a sane man to be anti-American.
Nobody who values human life can be
against 180 million people, nobody who
values liberty can be against the first ten
amendments, nobody who values the pur-
suit of happiness can be against govern-
ment by a system of checks and balances.
The historical and cultural diversity of
America makes the notion of “American-
ism ’ so elusive that it is unthinkingly silly
to call Mr. Ashbolt an anti-American.
“The label of anti-Americanism is gener-
ally stuck, rather unthinkingly, on those
non-Americans who sometimes quarrel with
the uses of American power in the world
today.”
By the end of the book we are bound
to wonder what the force of that “some-
times” is, for Mr. Ashbolt quarrels with
every use of American power in the world
today that he mentions or discusses. He
argues that America is an imperialist and
colonialist power—the crucial rhetoric
here, for it can’t be called history or theory,
is at pp. 233-236. Cuba and the Congo ring
like bells throughout the book, usually
with the simple assumption that America
is damned by invoking them and without
the detailed argument that a Theodore
Draper or a Boris Goldenberg provides us
with. Ashbolt applauds the fact that Soviet
propaganda is for peace, while American
propaganda is too weighted to war (as I
write on May Day there \Vill be the usual
parade of Soviet armed might through the
Red Square and Marshal Malinovsky will
be sounding off). Ashbolt offers as evidence
that “American propaganda” is so weighted
a speech in 1961 by Goldwater. That kind
of supporting evidence is slanted and
exemplifies the kind of special pleading
that pervades the book.
Mr. Ashbolt’s argument is a cogent one
against the notion of the “un-American,”
which only native-born Americans are said
to be. But it is not strong enough to show
that it never makes sense to say of a non-
American that he is anti-American. To be
anti-American is to have a set attitude
about any and every American develop-
ment or policy. On the evidence of the
talks we used to hear from him while he
was there, and the assorted essays which
make up this book, he is a classic anti-
American of the Australian left. There is
scarcely any let-up in the unrelenting
scolding throughout the book: a friendly
remark about San Francisco, a vivid
tribute to the glory of the Fall in New
England, some concessions about American
education, though the “monastic-military
discipline of the Christian Brothers” is pre-
ferred to the freedom of American schools.
Otherwise the nagging about integration
being too slow, about corruption (and even
about public exposure of corruption),

crime, the noise of cities, the weather,
galloping consumption, and planned obso-
lescence is unrelieved.
When Mr. Khrushchev (who emerges as
even more the hero of the book than Mr.
Justice Hugo Black) visits New York it is
“free-world hooliganism” that upsets Mr.
Ashbolt rather than the hooliganism of the
“generous,” “witty,” “humorous and
affable” K. Russia tends to appear as a
lamb throughout and one would never
gather that a reasonable anti-Communist
position can be supported. All references
to anti-Communists are prefaced by some
such phrase as “conspiratorially or psy-
chotically anti-Communist” or followed by
“witchhunt.” “From our ratbag fringe of
ultra-conservatives, it is y frequently even
suggested that opposition to any aspect
of American conduct, national or inter-
national, springs from the conspiratorial
machinations of the Communist Party.”
An author who accepts evidence of con-
spiratorial machinations only when it is
American and denies it only when it is
Communist is not in a conspicuously good
position to fulminate against conspiratorial
views of history, especially when we are
told about the precautions Mr. Ashbolt
took to check under the hood of his car
after one of his television appearances.
Mr. Ashbolt complains about American
groupism. The most startling sentence
reads, “The most startling yet elemental
fact about America ... is that people
still cluster together in groups, divided
from each other on the basis of either
money, job, immigrant nationality, racial
origin or religious belief.” But the most
commonplace fact about all human beings
is that they cluster together in groups.
Ashbolt proceeds to use something that is
universally true of all human beings to
castigate American anti-semitism and status
consciousness as if these are uniquely and
solely American. The manifestations of
anti-semitism Ashbolt describes are like
those in Australia or in many other coun-
tries; there have been greater excesses of
anti-semitism in many other countries
(e.g., Russia and Germany) than in the
United States; and there is also more
pro-semitism in many quarters in America
than in many other countries.
Mr. Ashbolt complains about the Ameri-
can myth of Manifest Destiny and of
America as the Promised Land. I must con-
fess that when I was in America in the
early 1960 s I never heard anyone use
these bits of textbook rhetoric except as
a joke: “Moses said to the people of
Israel, gather your asses, mount your
camels, I will lead you to the Promised
Land. Roosevelt, or Kennedy, said to the
people of America, sit on your asses, light
up your camels, this is the Promised Land.”
Mr. Ashbolt complains about Mr. Justice
Frankfurter’s doctrine of “ judicial self-re-
straint” and praises Mr. Justice Black’s
interventionism. In doing so he makes no
attempt at all to expound Frankfurter’s
position. One may prefer to support the
judicial interventionists against the apostles
of judicial self-restraint in the politics of
the United States Supreme Court. But
Frankfurter’s position was at least a cogent
one: Judges being appointed and not
elected ought not to lightly to decide
against majority decisions of elected bodies,
even where they thought them wrong.
Mr. Ashbolt, nobly, is incensed about
the slow rate of progress America has made
in the emancipation of negroes 100 years
after the end of the Civil War. No friend
of the United States, no critic, should wish
to disagree with what he says about the
oppression, injustice, and humbug involved.
One might only suggest that Mr. Ashbolt’s
account of it all adds nothing to the
enormous literature from Gunnar Myrdal
to James Baldwin.
An account of an experience, e.g., of a
religious experience, may tell us more
about the person having the experience
than about the object of the experience.
This sometimes comes home to us in read-
ing “An American Experience.” The book
is a mixture of conventional reporting and
animus. One constantly has to remind one-
self of what might be said by way of
reply or objection to what Ashbolt asserts.
One can agree with Mr. Ashbolt about the
desirability of dissent or of being, like Mr.
Justice Black or C. Wright Mills, radical.
But for Ashbolt being radical does not
mean going to the root of things. It means
being different from “tepid liberalism,” not
caring is one’s opinions coincide with Com-
munist opinions or appear to bolster Com-
munist opinions, not being “psychotically
anti-Communist.” Mr. Ashbolt, then, be-
lieves that he is not anti-American and not
anti-Communist. The latter is certainly true,
but the whole tenor of his book casts
doubt on his obviously sincere conviction
that the former is not true.
The World of Nehru
By DAVID MARTIN
Nehru. A Contemporary’s Estimate. Walter
Crocker. Allen and Unwin. $4.80.
BOOKS by Australian diplomats on
great contemporaries observed at
close quarters are much too rare. Still
rarer are those that deal with the leading
figures of South and South-East Asia, the
part of the. world with which our fate is
interwoven. For this and other reasons
Mr. Crocker’s thoughtful sketch of one of
the most fascinating men of our time is
sure to be read with interest.
It does not pretend to be a biography,
and as a psychological assessment it has
its shortcomings. In the context of the
task which our able former High Commis-
sioner in New Delhi set himself this is
understandable, but what surprises is that
he seems to write more from a British
than an Australian standpoint. There are
a few references to Nehru’s desire for good
relations with this country and to his per-
ceptiveness concerning our problems he
was nothing if not a perceptive being
but little about Australia’s special involve-
ments. Nevertheless, there is a native
quality in the author’s unusual candor; far
more than Lord Casey he is prepared to
call a spade a spade and he is refreshingly
uninhibited about personalities and events.
Much of the book is given over to an
attempt to set Nehru’s life in its historic
perspective. As far as this compels the
author to analyse the main socio-political
and cultural trends of modern India as
an outgrowth of her traditions it is pretty
conventional, with that .mixture of love
and irritation which is so familiar. He
tends to underestimate the breadth, par-
ticularly in its triumphant stage, of the
nationalist movement, and his evaluation
of Britain’s role is too one-sidedly positive:
the fact that India represented a marvel-
lous investment is not hinted at.
The Goa affair is, as so often, seen
simply as a betra, al of the principles
Nehru inherited from Gandhi, as if this
was all there was to it. It is not explained
by what peaceful means the Portugese
could have been induced to emulate the
example of the sensible French in Pondi-
cherry. What do you do with people who
just will not quit; what would we have
done in like circumstances? Nehru’s India
antagonised many by its international
moralising, and it is too easy to beat her
at her own game. But Mr. Crocker is not
a malevolent critic. He is much more
generous about Krishna Menon than most
Westerners; he fairly acknowledges that in
her conflict with China India’s stand is
not as unambiguously virtuous as some of
us would like to believe, and he pays
tribute to Nehru’s cleverness in playing
on American fears and getting her to
accept the Macmahon Line.
He justly admires his hero’s political
finesse. He profoundly understands the
split in his personality which made him
something of a stranger in the country he
served with a poet’s passion, being aware
of the Hamlet element in his nature. He


is best when telling of the man’s unique
charm and complex knighterrantry, for
like many who knew him well he could
not resist it. The universal attractiveness
of Nehru lay in his style, a word we
should not be afraid of. Considerate to a
fault, he was also explosively short-
tempered (but he was generally sur-
rounded by mediocre talents), his noble
spirit was not without deviousness, and
none knew better than he himself how
hard it is to reconcile the warrior, the
artist, and the statesman. He did reconcile
them, and many facets besides, and in the
process mastered tragedy through courage.
He would have been outstanding in any
period and any nation, this rationalist
Kashmiri Brahmin who had for his stage
one of the most glorious and most un-
happy countries in the ' world ... a
country which, before our eyes, seems to
be slowly sinking under the weight of
poverty and tradition.
Nehru, which Mr. Crock.er well shows,
was himself caught between the opposites
of revolution and tradition. Less well
illuminated is the domination-surrender
motif which ran through his whole life.
Proudest of contemporaries, he also had
a markedly feminine streak. Though essen-
tially lonely from boyhood, or perhaps
because of his loneliness, he could be
governed by those to whom he gave his
trust, however hesitatingly at times. I am
thinking of his father, Motilal but this
was natural and unavoidable of Gandhi,
who he loved more than he was loved in
return, of Lord and Lady Mountbatten,
and of Krishna Menon. Unfortunately for
him, and perhaps for India, at the end
nobody was left of remotely comparable
stature. Mr. Crocker thinks that Rajago-
palachari was in most respects Nehru’s
equal, but I cannot agree. Rajaji’s still re-
markable consistency might have comple-
mented Nehru’s brilliant flexibility, play-
ing Gladstone to his Disraeli. But his
Madrassi subtlety and resilience belongs to
a different age from that which Nehru
symbolised. After independence there was
only one other who could have matched
his grasp and stamina: the homegrown,
implacable, potential colossus that was
Valabhai Patel. Had he lived, even India
might well have proved too small for two
such champions.
I sense that Mr. Crocker believes that
Nehru finally suffered decisive defeats,
worn down by the inertia of an environ-
ment too onmalleable for any individual.
He may be right: after all Gandhi’s work,
too, has all but come to naught. Of all
societies India’s is the most multicentric;
every movement is deflected by countless
buffers before it even approaches its goal.
Allowing for permissible prejudices, this
book gets its major facts right, but slips
up on some minor ones: for instance, Ernst
Toller was not killed by the Nazis. It is
an affectionate and useful contribution to
the growing literature on a man whom
Australia’s leaders, at a mutually critical
stage, were too aloof to really understand,
Nehru which is surely fantastic
never visited us, nor did his first successor.
I wonder when we shall see his daughter.
Amis and the secret society
By MAURICE SHADBOLT
The Egyptologists. Kingsley Amis and
Robert Conquest. Jonathan Cape. $2.30.
ONE must assume that Kingsley Amis
knows what he is about; it’s only
reasonable to credit a writer with
knowing himself. As for us, we know Amis
the poet, Amis the novelist, Amis the
science-fiction lover, and anthologiser, and
more recently Amis the interpreter of lan
Fleming. Now we have Amis as light enter-
tainer, co-author of an anecdote about as
flat and memorable as a barfly’s drunken
yarn. Perhaps the point of this new offer-
ing is to haye his name on yet another
book; it’s difficult to see any other justi-
fication for it.
The book’s central idea—a secret society
devoted to adultery, and the advance of
polygamy, behind the disguise of spurious
Egyptology—has possibilities; the striking
thing is that every possibility is tossed away
in favor of a comfortable laugh. I don’t
really want to sound ungrateful for the few
I had, but it was slender reward for an
otherwise arid trek through 250 pages:
the book’s actual content might just have
been acceptable in a moderately long maga-
zine story. For the idea —or gimmick—is
everything. When one has described the
society, one has summarised the novel.
It’s hardly even necessary to add that
the society down, through one for-
tuitous occurrence and another, and that
it turns out that most wives in the mar-
riage involved have guessed at the society’s
true nature all along. This might have sug-
gested a much more interesting possibility
for the true social satirist: what if the
society had not broken down, what if it
had been a wonderful success in institu-
tionalising adultery and stabilising mar-
riage? But of course the issue is avoided;
the authors have the society break down,
for the laughs. There is even the adulterer
who begins to take a furtive and genuine
interest in Egyptology, against all the
society’s rules; and a comically disastrous
TV program of the sort now almost obliga-
tory in “with-it” novels. The publishers call
the book “one of the most outrageously
funny spoofs of the season.” Spoof? There
is not a target in sight. The only spoof,
perhaps, is that practised on a reader who
may expect something more from the name
Kingsley Amis.
Are such expectations really justified?
Looking back, sees only a nice talent
for the comic as giving consistency to his
novels. “Lucky Jim,” appearing when it
did, seemed much more than it actually
was: along with John Wain’s “Hurry On
Down” it struck just the right note with
the rise of the English provincials in the
19505. Wain and Amis had something in
common then, as poets and first novelists.
But their careers have run oddly parallel
since; both, in fiction, have turned more
and more into entertainers, ticklers of the
imagination. Wain, at least, has redeemed
himself as essayist and autobiographer. But
Amis, as a man of letters, often seems to
have taken pride only in being arrogantly
obtuse; as obtuse, say, as he insists other
people are about science fiction. In the
1950 s his provincial scepticism seemed
healthy. In the 1960 s it seems he has noth-
ing he wants urgently to say.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Buoyantly Stagnant
THE Treasury has had a very lucky run indeed calling
“heads”; last week’s British Budget may have seen the
first real break in its luck when the capital imports penny
came down “tails.” Just one day after the Treasury assured
everyone that the economy had moved toward internal and
external balance “without losing much in the momentum of
growth,” the British decided to make what has now been
estimated as a $75 million cut in Australia’s annual capital
imports from the U.K.
This would mean cutting the British capital flow to Australia
by one third, which seems a remarkably modest reduction in
view of the very high levels it had reached in recent times.
But the Treasury is still calling “heads”; now it is placing its
bet that capital inflow from other countries can be even further
increased to make up some of this leeway (President Johnson
would be enthralled by this) and that several inches of rain
will fall in drought areas to provide rural exports with a nice big
kick along. We can only hope that Sir Roland Wilson’s
rabbit’s foot is still working.
Capital inflow, however, is not the main reason the Treasury
appeared so content with things in last week’s Information
Bulletin. It bases its “everything is lovely” view on the fact
that employment has continued to increase strongly, which
indicates, it says, that “expansion must still be vigorous” in
important areas of activity.
But the Treasury’s figures show that in manufacturing indus-
try, Australia’s biggest employer, a most serious slow-down has
taken place, particularly when the only really buoyant section
(food, drink, and tobacco) is removed. During the 12 months
to February, manufacturing employment rose by 12,500, or one
per cent. Yet this was during a period in which almost 150,000
immigrants came to this country.
It is clear that manufacturing industry is having to bear the
brunt of the restraints on the rest of the economy needed to
allow Australia’s huge national development projects and defence
spending to proceed. The Treasury’s refusal to lower interest
rates, even fractionally in the $75 million May loan, is aimed
at restraining an inflationary pressure that is clearly non-
existent in the manufacturing sector, even if it can be claimed
to exist elsewhere.
The Price of Loyalty
AUSTRALIA’S continued loyal membership of the sterling
area and her maintenance of the bulk of her overseas
reserves in sterling are in danger of becoming slightly
eccentric as time and British Budgets go by.
Last week’s inevitable clamp-down on the flow of British
capital to Australia (and other sterling countries) is simply
the latest example of the continued removal of the benefits
of membership of the sterling club. It is now questionable
whether the membership badge is worth the subscription, par-
ticularly with Britain moving toward membership of the Com-
mon Market once again. The subscription rates are high in-
deed, if only in terms of the risks taken by Australia of a
sterling devaluation by having the great bulk of her overseas
funds in sterling. Spreading the risk widely in other currencies,
and more gold, is not compatible with sterling club member-
ship.
Once upon a time, the sterling area provided a freedom of
movement of funds between members that brought mutual bene-
MEN AND MATTERS
UNTIL recently, 51-year-old Mel-
bourne civil engineer and former Z
special squad half colonel Mr. John
Holland had blown up more bridges than
he had built. But not any more. His
construction company, John Holland
(Holdings) Ltd., has lately been building
more (and bigger and better) bridges
than Mr. Holland ever managed to stick
a fuse to. The new Roseville and Cap-
tain Cook bridges in Sydney are his latest
achievements.
It was while blowing up bridges in the
army that Clifton V. Holland (who has
always been known as John and is no
relation to the late C. V. Holland, whose
motor company distributes Holden cars
in Sydney) decided to start up a civil
engineering business after the war, and
the bulk of his staff in those early days
were fellow ex-servicemen. Now the pro-
portion is down to about one quarter, but
not by design. Mr. Holland is still a
reservist and very army-minded.
AT the weekend, Mr. Eric Clementson
returned as managing-director of
Project Development Corporation
Ltd., the company he founded, after re-
signing in 1964 following a dispute with
other board members.
The main task he is now facing is to
restore PDC’s liquidity position, which
has been critical ever since PDC bought
his pastoral interests, North West Develop-
ments, at North West
Cape, near Concrete
Industries’ problem
child, two years ago
By last weekend he
had come good with
a $200,000 loan to
PDC from Tangible
Securities, the invest-
ment company he
controls. And it
seems likely that Mr.
John Holland
E. S. Clementson
Duke of Westminster
Clementson will sell PDC’s holdings in the
now successful Wynyard hotel and office
block development.
There is no doubt things will hum at
Project Development now he is back; al-
ready, at the beginning of this year, the
general manager, Mr. B. G. Hely, re-
signed “because of health reasons” when
Mr. Clementson began negotiating for his
return (Mr. Hely’s health has since quickly
improved, sufficiently for him to set up his
own company last month).
Perhaps there could be more changes to
come at PDC.
THE Duke of Westminster got in just in
time. His estate acquired 200
acres of rapidly developing indus-
trial land at Dandenong, outside Mel-
bourne, and the nine-storey Kembla Build-
ing in Sydney for $875,000 only weeks be-
fore Mr. Callaghan slapped his ban on the
flow of British capital to Australia.
The deals were negotiated in Febru-
ary when the fourth duke’s brother and
heir, Lord Robert Grosvenor, along with
Mr. M. H. Crichton, chairman of a num-
ber of London investment trusts, visited
Australia to survey certain prospects.
This is not the first time the Grosvenor
family (which owns about 300 acres in
London’s Belgravia and Mayfair) has ven-
tured into Australian real estate, with the
second Duke having built up his hold-
ings here to about $1.3 million before his
death in 1953 forced the sale of most of
them—including the Nestle Building in
Perth and office buildings in Collins and
Queen Streets, Melbourne—to help meet
the $5O million death duties.
The current duke, a 59-year-old soldier,
inherited N.S.W. properties valued in
1954 at about $630,000, including five
stores at Hurstville, Moree, Inverell,
Orange, and Gunnedah, leased for 21 years
to the Grocery and General group.


fits: Britain had her sterling reserves effectively bolstered by
using Australia’s external sterling balances, and Australia’s
use of sterling in external trade meant that the commercial
services of the City of London were called upon to a highly
profitable degree. In return, Australia received a solid flow
of capital that offset the invisible outflow caused by reliance
on the City’s financial services, shipping and so on.
In a strict trading sense, it was also sensible to maintain
membership of the sterling area while the greater part of Aus-
tralia’s trade was with sterling countries. This is ceasing to
apply, as Japan and the U.S. in particular grow as markets,
and the benefits Australia grants Britain in a tariff sense against
other suppliers is, after last week, now an anachronism when
related to the reciprocal benefits granted Australian exports
to the UK without the major benefit of freedom of capital
movement.
There is no doubt, of course, that an Australian withdrawal
from the sterling area would seriously damage sterling at a
time when it is fighting for survival as a major trading cur-
rency. But in commercial terms there could be benefits
to Australia in such a withdrawal nevertheless even if it
did force a devaluation of sterling.
Provided Australia had switched enough of her reserves out
of sterling (there has been some evidence in recent times
of a sensible lessening by the monetary authorities of the
proportion of sterling balances we hold as against other cur-
rencies), the devaluation of sterling while the Australian dollar
remained steady would provide cheaper financial services if
London were still to be used, while the proportion of Aus-
tralian exports to the U.K. that would be affected by changed
prices is getting proportionally smaller every year.
None of this is to deny the apparent necessity of some
urgency measure by Britain to solve its current problems. The
realities are, however, that there are steadily fewer reasons for
Australia automatically to suffer the inconveniences- of sticking
to an international monetary system that has a high risk factor
and few offsetting benefits. This painter will be cut sooner
or later by someone; it may as well be done when it suits
Australia.
This is not to suggest a move into the dollar camp. To
some extent there is a good case for assisting the destruction
of both major trading currencies, anyhow the dollar as
well as sterling. It seems that until there is a currency disaster
the world’s monetary authorities are determined to persist with
a financial brinkmanship that, by its consequential restraint
on development and trade because of international liquidity
shortages, threatens to dampen the pace of world economic
advance. A disaster would at least force some sensible move
to a solution of the world’s liquidity problem.
Work for Women
WOMEN turned up in force to the national “Women at
Work” conference convened by the Victorian Employers’
Federation in Melbourne, actually outnumbering men dele-
gates by three to two, which also happened to be the same ratio
of the sexes delivering addresses.
But what happened to the women working in industry?
Apart from those in the clothing trades picket outside demanding
equal pay, they were few and far between. Only one woman
from the unions turned up, Miss M. Caldwell, of the Meat
Workers. This set us wondering what women do in the meat
trade, except buy the stuff. The only other unionist present
apart from Mr. Riordan, who spoke on “The Trade Unions and
the Woman Worker,” was Mr. J. J. Brown from the Australian
Railways Union. Lonely as a cloud, but taking a very keen
interest indeed, was Mrs. A. Doig, of the Communist Party.
As for the employers, there was a good representation from
large industrial firms. 8.H.P., whose big problem is men, was
understandably missing, yet the others cocked their ears when,
in reply to a question, Britain’s Dame Mary Smieton said ever
so quietly that the gap between men’s and women’s wages in
British industry was being perceptibly narrowed by bargaining or,
to use a less aggressive word, negotiation. There is, of course,
no arbitration system, as we know it, in the U.K. The last time
our Arbitration Commission deigned to narrow the gap between
men and women in wages awards here was in 1950, so Australia’s
women should get down and follow Britain. They are no less
expert in domestic bargaining.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: After noting “a slower in-
crease” among a varied range of indicators, April’s
Treasury Information Bulletin comfortably reflects:
“Generally, it seems that the economy has moved toward
balance, both internally and externally, without losing
much in the momentum of growth” . . . The same Bulletin
talks about “capital inflow running very high”; so far
as funds from the United Kingdom are concerned, this
flow will be drastically restrained by the British Budget
. . . The Federal Government’s last 1965-66 Loan pre-
serves February interest rate structure . . . Mr. McMahon,
the Treasurer, has sought authority to borrow an extra
$l5O million to cover an unexpected 1965-66 deficit.
Overseas trade for April produced the 21st successive
monthly deficit, $18.4 million against $40.1 million in
March; higher wool exports are worth less, although the
overall export price index is improving . . . Savings bank
deposits fell heavily, by $24.2 million to $5117 million,
during March; the banks are lending more for housing.
For the markets: An essential firmness over Aus-
tralian share markets was, not unnaturally, fractured by
Wednesday’s first news of the British Budget; elucidation
of its effects is likely to go on for some time yet. Investors
were becoming a bit cagy just before the Budget.
Perhaps that is why the actual market retreat has been
kept fairly moderate.
Dead seemed London’s immediate pre-Budget tone. A
sense of relief afterwards did not yield any positive
advance, yet manufacturing sections are being carefully
culled to the detriment of service industries . . .Wall
Street now seems nervous about possibly inflationary cor-
porate profits and uncertain on Vietnam escalation. The
structure of Dow Jones is again under suspicion.
For companies: Mutual Western Australia iron
ore interests have at last been discovered and are to be
further explored by 8.H.P.-Cleveland Cliffs Iron (Deep-
dale area) and C.S.R.-American Metals Climax (Mount
Newman); “another meeting will be held in a few week’s
time” . . . Hamersley Iron, the CRA-Kaiser Steel part-
nership, has doubled nominal capital to $lO million, but
there’s no chance of a flotation this year.
Engineers and fabricators put out quite a series of
variegated results . . . They were undoubtedly led by
the non-ferrous Metal Manufactures, which achieved a
24.6 percent profit lift to $3,573,202 for its 50th year . . .
In contrast, Concrete Industries had to face inevitable
contracting troubles (North West Cape and Jindabyne),
passing the interim dividend after much talk of “stabili-
sing” dividend policy . . . Melbourne’s John Holland
(Holdings) gained a “several million dollars” contract for
the Savage River (Tas.) iron ore marine loading facilities
. . . George Wimpey’s Australian subsidiary is handling
plenty of civil engineering and housing work in N.S.W.
and Queensland.
Jam maker Henry Jones mysteriously brought its in-
terim payment from 2 \ to 3 percent, yet directors did
not think it “satisfactory” to issue an earnings statement
. . . Unilever (Australia) suffered a 12.1 percent profit
decline to $1,858,000 on sales up by 7.7 percent to a
peak $77 million.
Development Finance Corporation had to keep to a
steady 5J percent interim dividend after seven years of
rising annual payouts . . . Financier Direct Acceptance
also held an unchanged 4 percent interim on an 18 per-
cent earnings fall; directors are restricting borrowings ...
Blue Metal Industries successfully closed a $4 million
debenture issue to its own share and security holders
. . . Tasmanian woolbroker A. G. Webster proposes a
l-for-4 par issue.

Effects of the U.K. Budget
Greater capital inflow from America?
By CROESUS
WE now have it on the line from Mr. Callaghan, the British Chancellor of the
Exchequer, that, as we thought, the spate of the U.K. capital which swept out
here in the fortnight before his Budget was not so much funk capital fleeing from
socialism but genuine investment funds correctly anticipating an extension of restrictions
on the export of capital to cover the four main sterling area havens—Australia, N.Z.,
Canada, and Eire. /
The new restrictions really shouldn’t
take anybody by surprise here, though
they seem to have shocked a good many
who place good store on a high rate of
capital inflow. To me the real surprise
is that it has taken Britain so long to put
them on to supplement those placed on
capital flow to non-Commonwealth coun-
tries last year.
It has been obvious for 18 months or
more that British industrialists, and also
funds looking for an escape from Wilsonian
Britain, have been seeing the writing on
the wall.
In 1964-65, for which figures have only
recently been made available, we had
(leaving undistributed income out of the
sum) our second-highest yearly inflow of
private capital ever from Britain, exceeded
only in our boom year 1960-61. October
that year saw the election of the Wilson
Government, which opened up the path
to the corporation tax the following April
and the curbs on overseas investment in
non-Commonwealth countries, leaving for
the time being their further extension to
Commonwealth countries.
That year also saw Britain in one of its
worst (if not the worst) balance of pay-
ments crises, involving the borrowing of
massive foreign short-term funds to hold
up the pound. It is certainly remarkable
that we managed to get so much capital
from Britain in those circumstances, the
more so perhaps because of the enhanced
rewards to be had on funds in London
(British bank rate was 7 per cent from
October, 1964, to June, 1965, and has been
6 percent ever since, epitomising at least
the “interest rate” attraction Ot keeping
funds in Britain).
At any rate, the fact is that (exclusive
of undistributed income) Britain sent us
$165 million for direct private investment
compared with $lOl million, $136 million,
and $B7 million in the three previous years,
and with the record total of $lB7 million
in 1960-61. Furthermore, figures released
last week make it pretty clear that since
then, quite apart from the recent upsurge,
capital inflow from Britain has been run-
ning at an even higher rate than in 1964-
65."
For while no country breakdown will
be available for some time, and even if
the amount of capital coming from the
U.S. has been increasing more rapidly than
the supply from Britain, the latter seems
certain to have contributed a substantial
share of an increase in net apparent capi-
tal inflow, in the nine months to the end
of March, of $312 million over the like
period last year. This increase is in itself
astonishing, representing almost a doubling
from $320 million to $632 million in net
apparent inflow over the nine months.
Moreover, whatever happens now and given
that some of it represents “leads” in pay-
ments on Britain’s part, most of its bene-
ficial effects on our balance of payments
and overseas reserves look durable.
While those among us who abhor the
selling of the farm to overseas investors
will doubtless rejoice at Britain turning off
the tap of its own accord, the economic
effects on this country will be considerable,
if not exactly disastrous. Leaving aside
such considerations as the repercussions on
share and capital markets, where adjust-
ments threaten to be more serious than so
far evident, and also those bound to be
serious for British concerns operating here
and still relying largely on U.K. funds for
working and development capital, one has
to consider broader effects and their pos-
sible mitigation.
As one who has searched in vain among
Australian capital sources for the huge
sums CRA requires, Sir Maurice Mawby,
who has succeeded in harnessing vast sums
of overseas capital (mainly American) to
his development wagon, has demonstrated,
by implication anyhow, that with less over-
seas capital coming in the pace of develop-
ment will be slowed and that greater strains
will be placed on the limited supplies of
local capital available. In short, we will
not be able to find capital for all the
things we want to do. This has the impli-
cation that we will have to look closer at
investment priorities and possibly invoke
unpalatable surveillance of capital spend-
ing in some guise or other, to sort the
opera houses from the mines, so to speak.
One must be more concerned about this
aspect than, say, the effect on the balance
of payments. If portfolio investment is

taken out of the capital inflow from Brit-
ain—and it is a relatively small item even
if it has been rising significantly this past
year or so—the bulk of the remainder
(direct private investment) has its equiva-
lent in the imports bill and its withdrawal
deflates that bill in some rough proportion.
Also, if its withdrawal slackens the pace
of economic activity here, then this, too,
has some reducing effects on imports. In
the round, one would expect some deteri-
oration in our balance of payments to
follow the curbs, but not by any means a
catastrophic one.
We haven’t heard so much lately of the
capital export curbs President Johnson in-
troduced early last year. In fact, the first
fears that they would seriously cut the flow
of capital coming from the U.S. seem to
have been largely allayed. Certainly none
of the big mining groups here seems to
be complaining. Rather the contrary. As
a matter of fact, it could be that the
Americans will see the British curbs as a
further opportunity to build more invest-
ment bridges across to us.
r)NE wouldn’t imagine that the Ameri-
cans are all that worried that the
“‘statistical” returns on their investments
here have been reduced in recent years. By
statistical returns are meant those calcu-
lated by the Commonwealth Statistician.
For one thing, the latter is most apologetic
about his figures, saying in effect that they
don’t mean very much but are the best he
can do in the circumstances of having no
realistic way of measuring the value of U.S.
or any other accumulated foreign invest-
ment in Australia. His exercises on this
front are interesting, though. If the rates he
calculated for the various countries, which
put the return on U.S. capital at 5.7 and
Britain’s at 5.4, cannot be taken as gospel,
the fluctuations from year to year do show
that the returns on U.S. investment here
have been falling.
The Canberra correspondent of the Lon-
don “Economist” recently gave three
plausible reasons why these returns have
fallen in recent years, but these fail to take
into account the fact that in recent years
the bulk' of U.S. capital coming here has
gone into big industrial and mining pro-
jects which have yet to pay off, at least
on the expected scale.
Last year there was some discussion at
the Canberra conference of the Australian
Institute of Management (Sydney division)
on the scale of returns the U.S. would be
satisfied with in 1975 and a range from
6 to 8 percent was suggested (according
to Press reports, Mr. Callaghan seems to
be looking for 33 percent within three
years for any new British capital let
through his new net to us!). One would
have thought the American expectation
is beyond the 6 to 8 percent range and
that this will be amply fulfilled.
In the meantime, provided President
Johnson doesn’t really call a halt to keep
his balance of payments tidy and the wel-
come mat to overseas capital remains in
Canberra, my prediction is that the rate of
inflow of capital from the U.S. will in-
crease substantially in the coming years
and largely offset the shortfall from
Britain. But it is a pity we can’t get a
full flow from both sources.

Tailor-made Profits
The men's clothing revolution
By JOAN McCOLL
THE average Australian (man,
woman, and child) spends on
clothing and drapery $95 a year,
excluding $l6 per capita for footwear.
(We spend almost twice as much on
food and groceries.) Retail sales of
clothing and drapery have grown from
$B6B to $lO6B million from 1960 to
1965 (up 23 percent), but, as a propor-
tion of total retail sales, there has been
a slight decline from 17.6 percent to
17.1 percent.
Clothing manufacturers are aware
that in the past few years expenditure
on clothing did not parallel the in-
creased expenditure on cars and con-
sumer durables. Given sound economic
conditions, they look to a steady growth
in local and overseas business.
f |IHE big revolution in the clothing industry in this country is in male, not female,
J. fashions. The Australian male, whose had dressing was once legendary (it was con-
sidered sissy to evince any interest in fashion) now might pass unnoticed in an inter-
national airport with clothes that no longer scream his humble origin.
Twenty years ago, a good suit had to be
either tailored or imported—and a lot of
poor ones were, too. Toward the end of the
first post-war decade it became strikingly
apparent to some alert businessmen that
there was nothing very remarkable about
the quality of the bulk of imported suits.
The local product could be just as good,
or better.
And the big retail stores were keen to
see local makers get into the suit business
in a big way, for local buying meant much
less of the retailers’ money tied up for less
time in doing the actual importing and
stock-holding necessary with imported
clothing. So successful has the local in-
dustry been that nowadays imports of
ready-made suits are insignificant.
Into the field of fashion tailoring after
the war moved Anthony Squires and
Ernest Hiller, of Sydney, and Stafford-
Ellinson, of Melbourne. Designing their
own garments, and manufacturing under
licences from the U.S. and U.K., they
brought new standards to men’s tailoring
in Australia. Now New Zealand firms have
licensing arrangements with them and they
are succeeding in the export field, even in
the West End of London, and winning
international fashion awards.
It is impossible to determine how much
of the market is still held by the “bespoke”
tailors, although undoubtedly the tailoring
departments of the major department
stores have virtually been run out of
business by the success of the off-the-pegs.
Since makers provide about 325 fractional
fittings, no physical oddity is excuse enough
for individual tailoring. The manufac-
turers assert only a snob still has his suits
made to measure.
The trend to mass production is, of
course, world-wide and is an extension of
the levelling process throughout society.
(Even Paris couturiers must sell their de-
signs to the mass market.) It has meant a
better-quality, medium-priced garment, per-
haps designed not to “last a lifetime” be-
cause of its topicality. Textilers produce
a good deal directly for the manufacturers,
by-passing the wholesaler; they deny that
their fabrics are any better, or worse,
under the new system. The clothing makers
submit ideas to the textilers, and vice-
versa.
Anthony Squires introduced high-quality
tailoring to Australia with the assistance
of Hollandia Kattenburg N.V. In 1959 it
won the Milan Gold Cup for tailoring merit
at the International Textiles Fair and in
1962 shared the Caswell-Massey Inter-
national awards for male fashion excellence
with Hardy Amies and Brioni of Rome.
This encouraged trial shipments to 14
countries.
Sales per head of Australian popu-
lation are one of the largest by any
single tailoring organisation in the world,
all secured in the top-quality section of the
market. Squires is now directing its atten-
tion to the middle-priced field as well.

ND.I7.N.
In 1963 Stafford-Ellinson Consolidated
was Australia’s only member of the Inter-
national Fashion Council, enabling Austra-
lian men to buy top fashions simultane-
ously with their release in style centres of
the world. The proprietary company was
formed in 1958 to acquire from Felt and
Textiles the business of Ellinson Bros. It
was floated in 1962 and had an annual
turnover then of £lm. It makes men’s and
boys’ suits, overcoats, and sportswear at
four locations in Melbourne.
Ernest Hiller has built up an organisa-
tion with 500 employees, providing a wide
range of styles and sizes, within the average
man’s budget, of suits, topcoats, men’s
sportswear, and women’s slacks. Invading
the U.K., the company avoided the tradi-
tional market by concentrating on light-
weight suits (more acceptable with in-
creased central heating), which are air-
freighted on hangers and racks to London,
within three days of receiving the British
order in Sydney. A big triumph was to
secure manufacturing rights to suits for
Hardy Amies, well known in women’s
haute couture, who ventured into men’s
designs only six years ago.
In a separate category is Fletcher Jones
and Staff, specialist in men’s and women’s
slacks, and, latterly, skirts. As one of the
best examples of decentralisation in the
clothing industry, FJs has its main
plant at Warmambool (Vic.), with a
smaller one at Brunswick, and employs
almost 1500 people. FJs is unusual in that
it sells only through its own retail outlets.
It has some 20, and is opening them at
the rate of 2\ a year, following the trend
to suburban trading. (The best store, by
sales per square foot and per employee, is
at the Chadstone regional shopping
centre.) Unique features of FJs include
sales only for cash and solely from personal
fittings; monetary mark-ups rather than
percentages (giving better value to the
customer in the expensive garments);
after-sales service in mending and dry-
cleaning (which horrifies the American
clothing manufacturer), and staff co-
operatives.
Claiming “No man is hard to fit” and
“Nothing but trousers” (except skirts)> FJs
makes nine basic styles of men’s trousers
and seven fashion., styles, covering 181
sizes from 240 trouser cloths. When it won
the right to supply trousers for the Olym-
pic Games team in 1956, FJs was asked
to make the skirts for the women’s team
and was thus catapulted into women’s
wear. At first erring toward functional
masculine styles, there is now a high
fashion content; women’s garments make
up 25-30 percent of FJ’s present trade. It
produces 30 winter styles for ladies from
600 cloths (many imported), providing
fractional fittings inch waist fittings,
two hip fittings per waist, and at least
three lengths.
Using 6J miles of 60in.-wide material
a year, mostly 70s merinos, FJs is the
biggest user of 70s in this hemisphere. All
woollen fabrics used in men’s garments are
from local mills. FJs uses wool mixtures in
perhaps 15 percent of material used.
With a leg in both camps, FJs is close
to the customer and knows what he wants;
it knows the state of the retail trade and
can produce accordingly. A company
which only manufactures is at the mercy
of the retailer in recession times; a re-
tailer thrives on the manufacturer’s prob-
lems, buying up his stock at a huge dis-
count. A measure of FJ’s success in strad-
dling the two operations is its very large
turnover, served with a very small capital.
David Jones is a retailer with a fair
stake in manufacturing. The subsidiary,
Marlborough Productions Pty., provides
DJs only with garments not available on
the general market. (Volume and bulk
orders are made by outside customers.)
Producing St. James suits, sportscoats,
trousers, waistcoats, exclusive women’s
frocks and all types of sportswear against
firm orders from the store buyers, Marl-
borough asserts there is no conflict of
interests or opinions between producer and
buyer. Relationships are cordial and Marl-
borough trades as an independent organisa-
tion.
At the lower end of the field is Marco
Productions Ltd., a listed company making
trousers, jackets, coats, and suits at two
Sydney suburban locations. Speaking of the
change in men’s fashions, the company
said diversity in styling upsets large pro-
duction runs, demands higher expense mar-
gins on these fashion goods, but that
overall the industry will profit by the
stimulus to male clothing interest.

Conserves But No Jam

By JASON
THOSE who can see a higher 1965-
66 dividend from that arch-conserva-
tive jam and fruit canner Henry
Jones are incurable optimists. Admittedly
the interim has been lifted from 2\ to
3 percent but this looks merely a con-
cession to the new currency, making the
payout a nicely rounded 3 cents a share.
The group has paid 10 percent annually
for almost 30 years now and it seems
a reasonable bet that this year’s final will
be 7 percent, or 7 cents.
Besides, a dividend lift looks unlikely
if the group is planning an issue soon.
Nominal capital has already been in-
creased and at last year’s meeting share-
holders were told that an issue was con-
stantly under consideration. But the pos-
sibility, like so many other things, received
no mention in the interim report.
In the interim, sales were reported
higher but profits did not get a mention
except when directors pointed out that it
would “not be satisfactory” to issue a profit
statement because of the seasonal nature
of the business. If so, it seems likely the
same seasonal factors existed for the same
period of last year. If not, there could
surely have been an explanation for any
rise or fall, thus reducing the degree of
speculation which inevitably occurs when
the market is left to guess for itself.
FOREIGNERS still find the Australian
motel industry far more respectable
than do local investors, with big
groups like the Canadian Power Corpora-
tion putting lots of money into the indus-
try’s leader, Motels of Australia, with the
U.S. Travelodge and Holiday Inn groups
apparently friendly, too, and with every
chance that the British hotel group, Trust
Houses, will come to some sort of relation-
ship with Motels of Australia.
M. of A. is continuing its expansion,
particularly in urban areas, and now has
three motels in Sydney’s Kings Cross area
alone. The standard of accommodation
“greatly impressed” the visiting chairman
of Trust Houses, Sir Geoffrey Crowther,
who also admired the group’s ability to
get by with the minimum of service to
customers—a lesson he will no doubt take
to heart in his own group following the
British Budget’s payroll tax.
THE big news from Coca-Cola (of can-
ning lines in the Eastern States, more
soft drink products and disposable
bottles) has real significance for British
Tobacco, which has the Coke franchise in
Melbourne and Perth.
Up to now, all canned Coke has come
from the Perth plant, which will naturally
now lose out until local W.A. consump-
tion makes up the gap. So far there has
been no news of a canning line to be put
into British Tobacco’s Melbourne Coke
operation to make up for this loss, as the
$650,000 worth of Coca-Cola canning lines
announced are ones for Sydney, Brisbane,
and .Adelaide.
If a canning line does come to Coke in
Melbourne this could provide British
Tobacco with an opportunity of getting
into canned soft drinks to compete with
Tarax without disturbing the market posi-
tion of its Marchants operation. And the
same will go for disposable bottles (es-
pecially useful for vending machines), if
the present Sydney-only arrangements
spread interstate. These developments
could step up British Tobacco’s enthusiasm
to get more Coke franchises.
OMINOUS words from Cranvel, the
W.A. agricultural equipment manu-
facturer, suggest there is something
more serious affecting the group than
drought-reduced sales. A loss was appar-
ently incurred in the December six months
and the auditors have been asked to ex-
amine the accounts. Exactly why is still
unclear, although directors would have
us believe it is merely to ascertain the
extent of the loss.
They plan to make a further and pre-
sumably more detailed announcement
when results for the nine months to the
end of March are available. Not that this
will prove of very much help. If it took
the group almost four months to report
on the December period, it will be the
end of July before March figures are at
hand. By that time the company will have
ruled off its books for 1965-66 and inevit-
able leaks will have enabled the share
market to do most of the damage before
all shareholders are fully aware of their
fate.
THE fall in tallow and meatmeal
prices is going to confirm Pridhams
Holdings Ltd. as a member of an
unfortunately large band of unimpressive
new floats in recent years at least in
the short run. Tallow and meatmeal are
the group’s two main products. The price
falls may be only temporary but they seem
certain to affect earnings in this last half of
the current financial year. In the first six
months to December 31, profits failed to
reach budget levels. And worse, directors
had some doubts as to whether the ten
percent dividend forecast in the prospectus
would be paid.
Shareholders did not take this announce-
ment very kindly, mainly because state-
ments in the prospectus were compiled in
late November, when the first half of the
year was already five months gone. Still,
they must realise that they are in an
industry which can be subject to violent
seasonal fluctuations. Fortunately, the
group was fairly strong financially before
it floated, so 1965-66 may prove to be a
mere delayer of satisfactory dividends and
respectable profits.
WITH the rapid development going
on in Western Australia, Bell Bros.
Holdings should be getting its
share of business. The group has wide-
spread interests in such fields as quarry-
ing, road building, cartage, construction,
and the hiring of all types of machinery
and transportation. It joined the public
lists only last year, earning 15.8 percent
on dividend-ranking capital.
Profit in the latest December six
months was higher at $319,000 than the
$316,000 for the full 1964-65 year and
was after tax at $336,000 (more than the
profit) and a depreciation figure which is
getting on toward the $1 million mark.
Added together, the tax and deprecia-
tion figures come to $1,282,000, which is
almost as much as the $1,334,000 provided
for the two items in the full 1964-65 12
months. If this growth can be main-
tained, the shares may not be all that dear
at around $1.30.
ANTI Friction Bearings seems
doomed to another year of medioc-
rity. Shareholders hopes were
revived in 1964-65, when earning rate
rose from 8.8 to 11.2 percent. At the same
time they received a blow' when the
group’s shaky financial position necessi-
tated a dividend cut from eight to five
percent, despite the profit rise.
Now it seems that the cut was a wise
one. The profit improvement has proved
short-lived. Results are reported con-
siderably lower in the December six
months, despite a 12 percent sales rise.
The profit came back from $25,000 to
$19,000. However, it seems possible that
dividend will be held this year as the
board has reported a significant improve-
ment in liquidity since June 30 last.

LETTER
Mr. Corrie Replies
Sir,
The article (8., April 30) about Robin
Corrie “Biting the hand . . of ATI, is:
* Damaging to my integrity
* Detrimental to my business, and,
* In most parts, inaccurate.
The facts are as follows:
(1) To suggest that my firm recom-
mends to its clients to sell ATI shares be-
cause of an alleged resentment to ATI is
defamatory to our integrity, which could
shake the confidence of our clients.
(2) 'ATI did not “dump” Corrie & Co.
Because of ATl’s growth and future capi-
tal requirements it needed brokers with
wider national and international connec-
tions and resources. This, Corrie & Co.
did not have, but is most certainly pos-
sessed by lan Potter & Co., ATl’s current
underwriters. The decision by ATl—
which also affected a Sydney broking
firm, which were co-underwriters—was
made so amicably that Corrie & Co. con-
tinues to transact business on behalf of the
Ansett organisation.
(2) Our advice to clients in our cir-
cular was based on history—in two pre-
vious pre-election periods ATI share
prices have dropped.
(4) Our view is quite clearly shared
by ATI. Reconcile the price of 75c, at
which ATI placed 2.7 million shares, with
the price of 78c prevailing when we rec-
ommended our clients to sell. Clearly,
ATI did not expect to obtain more. Why?
The answer is obvious (as our circular
pointed out).
(5) The advice by Corrie & Co. to sell
ATI shares coinciding with the almost
simultaneous placement of the shares by
ATI through lan Potter & Co. was just
that—a coincidence.
(6) Since lan Potter & Co. was ap-
pointed by ATI as its underwriters on
December 17, 1964, Corrie & Co. has,
three times, recommended its clients to
buy ATI shares —so much for “Biting the
hand . . .”
(7) We challenge THE BULLETIN to
deny that ATl’s future prosperity would
be less certain if Labor won the next
Federal election; this would surely make
investors dubious about their ATI shares
in a pre-election period.
(8) Dealing with our recommendations
to sell ATI and buy Comeng Holdings,
you made major errors of political and
geographical fact. Politically, your view
conflicts with that of investors through-
out the world, that South Africa, where
Comeng has major interests, is a haven
for private capital investment. Geo-
graphically, the last annual report of
Comeng does not indicate that it has any
interests in Rhodesia, which you claim it
has.

Berlei’s British Budget Bonus
THE Australian company that stands to
gain most from the British Budget’s
“bonus” to manufacturers of 7s. 6d.
per employee is Berlei United Ltd., which
has been earning the bulk of its group
profits in the U.K. rather than at home in
Australia for some years.
The new British payroll tax of 255. per
employee a week, combined with a rebate
of 325. 6d. to manufacturing companies
(of which Berlei U.K. is one), means not
only that Berlei’s costs will fall in the U.K.
but also that its employee shortage, which
was already becoming a significant factor,
is likely to ease as tertiary industries that
do not have the benefit of the rebate get
rid of staff.
The U.K. subsidiary manages to earn
more than 18 percent on shareholders’
funds, while the Australian company can
do no better than about the 8 percent
mark—a difference that the parent com-
pany has not been keen to advertise. This
distinction is all the more dramatic as it
is despite the fact that the British com-
pany’s sales are no greater than those of
the Australian company, and it employs
slightly less than half the group’s fixed
assets at book value.
And even though the British company
spends more on advertising (or because of
it?), with its appropriation up around the
$45,000 mark against the . local one of
something like $300,000, it has\managed
to build up its net profits to somewhere
near 9.3 percent of sales compared with
about 4 percent for Berlei’s Australian
operations. The group’s average on total
sales of $13.6 million is about 6.6 percent.
The growing significance of the U.K.
subsidiary in the past four years is evi-
dent from the fact that the British com-
pany’s profits (in Australian pounds) have
risen from £189,217 in the year to Tune,
1962, £168,934 in 1963, £194,318 in
1964, to £318,519 in 1965. At the same
time the rest of the Berlei group has
earned only £61,897, £29,726, £67,405,
and £131,037 respectively. So of last year’s
big group profit rise of £lBB,OOO, the U.K.
company provided about £124,000, or
more than two-thirds.
One explanation given for the better
U.K. figures is that the U.K. company is
not charged for Australian designs. But
as the U.K. firm has its own team of
designers, which came up with Gay Slant
girdles to substitute for the Sarong line lost
recently (regarding which a sstg. 100,000
liability was provided in last accounts), the
reliance on Australian designs should not
be very great these days. Berlei is among-
the big three (behind Playtex and Corsets
Silhouette in terms of profit, anyway).
Profit of Berlei (U.K.) in 1964-65 was
filed as $637,000, vet Berlie United’s group
profit was $899,000 including that attri-
buted to 19,172 £stg.l ordinary shares
held by minority interests. The U.K. com-
pany, in fact, made 122 percent on capital.
No wonder Berlei arranged to buy up those
minority interests early this year. The
source of the 1957 one-for-four bonus, it
should be remembered, was revaluation of
the U.K. shares.


How to Read the Charts
By GERALD LAURANCE
PL the two months since THE
BULLETIN started printing charts
of share price movements in stocks
dealt with on the “Security Analysis”
page, many readers have written ask-
ing about the methods of interpreting
these charts—and whether charts were
of much use, anyway. This article is
the first of a series of four to be
printed over the next month and aimed
at answering those questions.
OVER the past few years Australian
investors have been invited by vari-
ous investment services to subscribe
to letters of recommendation based on
charts, or to purchase charts of the price
behaviour of specific shares. The hostility
which has arisen in some areas toward
these “chartists” may well have been
prompted by their advertised claims, which
read almost like turf racing systems. At
the same time these advertisements are
unique on the local scene in that there is
no other public canvassing by firms of
investment counsellors. Stockbrokers, of
course, are prohibited from advertising
anything else but their name and address.
Quite apart from the validity or other-
wise of the claims of these “chartists” is
the actual chart of a company’s shares.
There can be no suggestion of any magic
quality in the pictorial representation of
a series of prices. It requires no special
ability to transfer a list of prices on to a
graph. This is done in many businesses for
statistical purposes; one would need a very
exceptional memory indeed to be able to
recall whether any particular share, out of
several hundred, was rising or falling after
allowing- for cash and bonus share issues,
returns of capital, priority entitlements,
and so forth. Again, it would be extremely
difficult to recall whether any particular
share was moving against the trend of
prices of the shares of other companies in
the same industry.
On these grounds there can be no
doubt that a chart of a share’s price (or
for that matter any other tabulated data)
is an invaluable item should it be neces-
sary to have a picture of the market be-
haviour of a share. Certainly the visual
impact of a graph is far more convenient
than a mass of figures. We are all familiar
with the charts in cartoonists’ boardrooms.
The types of charts used by stockmarket
“chartists” fall into four main groups and
their use depends to a large extent on
the purposes for which they are required.
The bar chart, drawn on a proportional
scale, shows the real trend of a share dur-
ing the period selected. The point chart
does this also, but may hold more interest
for the person interested in day-to-day
movements. This group has several vari-
ants: half-point, point, three point, etc.
Another type of graph shows the relative
strength of one share against a group of
others, while the fourth uses a moving
average and finds its greatest use among
those interested in graphs following the
movements of the stock exchange indices.
Leaving aside the question of whether
such charts can provide any sound basis
for prediction of future price movements,
nevertheless they may be useful additions
to the investor’s armory. A knowledge of
the techniques involved may be rewarding.
The Bar Chart
The bar chart is so called because it
is a series of vertical bars, each of which
covers the range of trading for the period
involved. A daily bar chart would show the
range of prices at which a share sold each
day. A chart on a weekly basis would have
one bar for the week’s trading. On each
bar the closing price can be indicated
and it is usual also to show on this type
of chart the number of shares traded. This
is done by another bar positioned well
away from the price bar, usually on the
bottom of the chart. The bars indicating
turnover will of course all have their lower
ends on the same horizontal line.
An important factor in the compilation
of the bar chart is that the price axis
should be on a proportional scale, so that
each time the share price moves, say 25
percent, the visual distance of movement
on the chart remains the same. The use
of this type of scale means that more
significance is attached to a rise of 50 cents
when a share is at $2.00 than when it is
at $3.00.
The proportional scale of the bar chart
also means that a rate of movement (up
or down) over time becomes established,
and it is surprising how many shares, when
plotted in this way, maintain a fairly
constant trend. Of course, in this type of
chart as well as the others, it is essential
to make adjustments to the price scale
when shares go “ex rights” or have any
other kind of capital move which affects
price arithmetically; otherwise the chart
would show a fall whenever an issue was
made.
The reason for including the turnover
on the bar chart is that it aids in showing
whether the share is acting bullishly or
bearishlv. When a price fall is accom-
panied by a rise in turnover it is a sign
that sellers exceed buyers. The various
combinations of price movement and turn-
over are fairly obvious, but turnover has
another role to play when considering the
formation of particular patterns of move-
ment. They are of two types: those which
provide the basis from which the chartists
predict the likely course of price move-
ment. They are of two types; those which
occur during extended upward and down-
ward movements and those which occur
at the end of a sustained upward or down-
ward movement and are seen at points of
reversal in the course of a share’s price
behaviour.
The first group includes ascending and
descending triangles, and other patterns
known as wedges, flags, and pennants. In
all of these the behaviour of turnover is a
main criterion in the chartist’s interpreta-
tion, just as it is also an essential item in
his interpretation of the reversal patterns
which include the famous “head and
shoulders,” “double bottoms,” and so on.
The chart illustrated below is of an actual
stock and contains some of the features
mentioned above. Although the chart
shows bars for the price range over the
full period pictured, it is not necessary
to do this in order to trace what has hap-
pened in the past. A line linking the
closing prices for each week or month may
be all that is required, with only the past
month or so showing bars for actual price
ranges.

Pressures on Aluminium
Switching from copper continues
CONSUMERS switching from copper
have added to pressure on world
aluminium supply. Overseas markets for
bauxite and the refined alumina are al-
ready important for Australian producers,
while in coming years smelter output, too,
will need overseas buyers.
From operating at 83 percent of
capacity in 1959-61, the U.S. aluminium
smelting industry last year saw plants
working at 105 percent of rated capacity,
and higher.
At the same time prices fixed by
major producers, with virtually no “free”
market have recovered some of the
ground lost during the years of over-
capacity. In 1955-7 U.S. aluminium prices
averaged 25.7 U.S. cents a lb.; at present
the price is 24.5 cents, or 5 percent lower.
In the interval the level had fallen to
87.9 percent of the 1955-7 level in 1963,
and then climbed steadily until January,
1965.
Prices elsewhere have moved in a
similar pattern 7 the U.K. price is at
present £stg.l96 and the Australian price
SAS2O a ton.
U.S. producers decided that the market
would support a |-cent a lb. boost late
Ust yf ar > but the Government used its
stockpile as a big stick to hold the 24.5
cents price. The upward pressure on
prices will probably continue, both in the
U.S. and elsewhere, while the Govern-
ment’s downward pressure will presumably
ease a * some stage. (The U.S. level is a
guide to overseas price moves.)
In 1966 the U.S. industry had planned
for a 5-10 percent lift in consumption. But
the growth of the economy and higher
military use have meant that, in the words
of the chairman of Reynolds Metals, “It
now appears that the increase may be
even more substantial.”
In the third quarter this year, American
producers will be required to set aside
195,000 short tons for military and related
orders. This is a5O percent increase
on the second quarter set-asides, and rep-
resents 12 percent of expected production
in the period. The rise is largely for
supplies for the Vietnam war.
Although ingot prices have been held
back, the semi-fabricated sector has taken
advantage of the situation to restore
severely eroded profit margins. In these
circumstances profits of the major pro-
ducers are moving ahead well. Yet it is
still generally felt in the industry that
profits are too low—last year the U.S.
producers earned 4.9 percent on capital,
compared with over 10 percent for com-
parable operators in other industries.
The leap in consumption has begun to
create pressures in the aluminium market
not unlike those in copper. At present,
imports from new plants in Eastern
Europe are being pressed into service
to fill the Western gap. Large-scale sub-
stitution by copper consumers could cause
supply hold-ups in aluminium.
But aluminium’s main sources of ore
supply are in far more politically-stable
areas than copper’s. This, along with the
more straightforward nature of mining
mainly opencut is an important stabilis-
ing influence. Smelter and refinery
(alumina) capacity are the bottle-
necks in aluminium production, not the
mines, where tin (in Bolivia) and copper
(in Chile and Zambia) have suffered.
Better Cocoa Prices
LATEST forecasts by the UN Food and
Agricultural Organisation indicate
that the prospect for cocoa prices—of
great significance to New Guinea—may not
be as bad as earlier production-demand
estimates had suggested.
Papua and New Guinea and surround-
ing areas have for some years been boost-
ing cocoa output faster than world growth.
In 1955-56 New Guinea production was
1000 tons. By 1960-61 production had
risen to 7000 tons, and the 1964-65 total
was more than three times this figure.
The FAO expects New Guinea output
to rise to 40,000 tons by 1970-71 and a
further jump to 52,000 tons by 1974-75.
World output, according to the FAO, will
total about 1.6 million tons in 1971—a
lower figure than some recent estimates
from other sources.
Consumption in 1970 is expected to
total (depending on price) 1.45 million
tons at £stg.2oo a ton; 1.53 million tons
to £l6O a ton, and 1.62 million tons at
£l2O a ton. The present price is £l9O a
ton.

Togetherness in Iron Ore
THE big rationalising plans of BHP,
CSR, and Cleveland Cliffs will prob-
ably not be the last example of a
growing (and necessary) trend toward
togetherness in W.A. iron ore development.
Sooner or later the Mt. Goldsworthy
development will also have to come to the
party —not by sharing in the Mt. Newman
venture itself and shelving its other
developments for the time being as BHP
and Cliffs appear to be doing, but simply
by sharing a pellet plant the big new
Newman group will have to build at Port
Hedland if it is to take over the Cliffs
pellet contract with Japan.
This will leave Goldsworthy a separate
development still, yet there are clearly
economies to be gained from sharing things
like a pellet plant (the construction of
which is known to have been under con-
sideration by Goldsworthy) as well as the
port facilities at Port Hedland—which the
W.A. Government so eagerly wants
developed into a major industrial area
(see page 13).
For the biggest developments in W.A.
iron ore exports are clearly to be in
pellets. It is true that most of Mt. New-
man’s ore is too high grade to be sensibly
put through a pelletising plant, but it is
also likely that a great deal of ore in the
Newman deposits is of a quality that
could require pelletising and so could be
used to meet the Cliffs order. This much
increased intensity of exploitation of Mt.
Newman would substantially improve the
economics of the venture. And it would
leave the Cliffs and BHP areas ready for
later development.
The rationalising in iron ore is long
overdue in a marketing sense, as rival
Japanese steel mills had concentrated
their buying through single agencies while
rival Australian producers still eagerly
undercut each other to get their orders.
It is ironic, however, that the pressure
for this rationalisation has come not from
the marketing problems but from the
pressures of developmental costs.
The significance of pellets is that de-
mand for them will be coming from other
areas than Japan, which at present domi-
nates Australia’s iron ore export trade.
THE first small contract for the export
of Western Australian iron ore pel-
lets to Europe is likely to be the
beginning of a trade that could develop
considerably in the 19705, when five of
the existing contracts with the Japanese
expire.
With traditional local supplies of low-
grade iron ores being worked out, the
European Coal and Steel Community’s
dependence on high-grade foreign ores is
growing. Imports of iron ore accounted
for 33 percent of requirements in 1955,
50 percent in 1964, and are expected to
reach .65 percent in 1970. It is estimated
that in 1975 the ECSC will have to import
83 million tons of iron ore, compared with
53 million tons by Japan, 44 million tons
by U.S.A., and 25 million tons by U.K.
Because of the increasing dependence on
imported ore, new steelworks are being
located at seaport’s such as the Rotterdam
Europort, Bremen, Dunkirk, Taranto, and
Newport in Wales. Port Talbot, where
SCOW is based, along with several other
U.K. ports, is being deepened to accommo-
date large ore carriers.
In Western Australia Hamersley Iron,
Cliffs West Australian Alining Pty. Ltd.,
and BHP have definite plans for the estab-
lishment of pelletisation plants. Hamers-
ley Iron’s recently revised Japanese con-
tract for 16 million tons of pellets over a
ten-year period has allowed it to go ahead
with construction of its plant at Dampier,
to commence production in 1968. The
company considers the minimum economic
capacity of the plant to be 2 million tons
a year and presumably is looking for fur-
ther contracts for its marginal production.
The port at King Bay will initially take
carriers up to 65,000 tons deadweight, but
will later be deepened for 100,000-ton
carriers.
Hamersley Iron is owned 40 percent by
Kaiser Steel Corporation and 60 percent
by Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd.,
which last month indicated its intention
of increasing its Australian shareholding
from 15 to 30 percent.
Cliffs is also due to commence exports
of pellets in 1968 at an average of 3.4 mil-
lion tons yearly for 21 years. Cliffs has
an agreement with BHP, its neighbor in
the Robe River goethite deposits (of lower
grade than hematite), to share certain
facilities, including a pelletisation plant
with a potential annual capacity of 5 mil-
lion tons. This is in the event of BHP
securing the export contract for 6.3 mil-
lion tons of pellets on which letters of
intent have been exchanged. The Mt.
Newman negotiations have thrown all this
in the melting pot.
Cliffs is owned 35 percent by Mitsui and
Co. and 65 percent by Cleveland Cliffs
Iron Co., which has offered a 14 percent
equity to Australian financial institutions.
Mt. Goldsworthy Alining Associates is
also known to have been investigating the
possibility of establishing a pelletisation
plant. Recent Press reports indicating that
the company may be negotiating ore con-
tracts with Italy seem feasible in view of
the fact that its current contract for 16.5
million tons of ore to Japan will expire in
1973. Mt. Goldsworthy is owned equally
by Cyprus Mines Corp., Utah Construc-
tion and Mining Co., and Consolidated
Gold Fields (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Borg-Warner’s Expansion
THERE is more significance in the re-
? cord turnover and huge expansion
program of Borg-Warner revealed in
the latest accounts of Borg-Warner (Aus-
tralia) Ltd., than in the lower profit after
much lower tax reported for 1965.
Digestive problems associated with the
expansion program involving s3| mil-
lion in new plant last year and another
$5.1 million already authorised, of which
$1.3 million was on order by last Decem-
ber 31—were the main reason for the profit
fall to the lowest figure in four years.
The Government-prompted mounting
demand for locally made automatic and
manual transmissions and axles (to replace
imports) was great enough last year, des-
pite the drought and the fall in motor
vehicle registrations, to lift sales to record
levels. No doubt the significant improve-
ment in Ford’s sales figures was a help
(and will probably be an even greater
help this year) to Borg-Warner, which
makes the model 35 automatic transmis-
sion used by Ford, BMC, and Rootes.
Increasing the local content of the model
35 and developing an axle and manual
transmission suitable for all types of
vehicles meant the company met with
delays in delivery and commissioning of
new machine tools, and losses of man
hours through the changeover and re-
arrangement of plant. These costs could
not be passed on to customers, so profits
suffered.
By mid-1966 the company expects its
automatic transmission to be 50 percent
Australian-made, in accordance with the
Government’s plan.
Although an investment allowance
whittled tax liability from $344,000 to
$104,000 (1964 $420,000), net profit de-
clined from $1,044,054 to $895,792. The
depreciation charge was $166,000 higher
at $846,000. Freehold properties were
increased by $484,554 to $3,274,000 (gross)
as well. This great capital investment
accounts for the increased indebtedness
with the bank (up $3,910,000 to
$4,484,000) and with an “affiliated”’ com-
pany (presumably Borg-Warner Corpora-
tion of the U.S.), up $378,000 to $438,000.
This was achieved without threat to
the modest ordinary dividend of 6 percent.
Earning rate fell from 17.4 percent in
1963 and 1964 to 14.8 percent. A better
guide to performance, in view of the
$2,447,852 preference capital (in three
classes), is the earning rate on total funds,
which at 10.4 percent is still probably
better-than-average. The ordinary divid-
end is provisioned by the need to pay
Borg-Warner Corporation, the holder of
the 2,207,852 $1 first preference shares,
the same as ordinary shareholders, in any-
thing above 6 percent.
A very fair warning by the chairman
that profitability would not improve, at
least until the middle of this vear, will
confine enthusiasm for this stock to those
who can take the longer view at the very
real market growth carved out for this
company by the Commonwealh Govern-
ment’s tariff concessions to local manu-
facturers.
But at $1.90 the $1 shares offer good
opportunities for capital appreciation to
those who are patient, and not dependent
on income from their investments.

Bell Bryant Merged
BELL BRYANT LTD. counts as a suc-
cessful merger. In its first year of
combined operations it earned 25.7
percent on capital, a higher rate than ever
achieved hy the parties to the merger,
Bryant Bros. (Holdings) Ltd. and James
Bell Machinery Holdings Ltd., in their
single days.
But the greater part of the profit rise
appears due to tax concessions through
export incentives.
Direct comparisons of 1964 and 1965
accounts are impossible, because the James
Bell Machinery group last published
accounts for the year to June 30, 1964,
and so Bell Bryant excluded them from
1964 comparative figures in the 1965
accounts. No statistical table is presented,
therefore, in this look Behind the Balance
Sheets.
James Bell’s last recorded independent
profit was $140,200 and Bryant Bros, (year
to December, 1964) was $132,174, totalling
$272,374 after $200,000 tax. Bell Bryant,
the wedded group, earned $328,590 after
taxation of $172,048, lightened by export
incentives, and $64,626 depreciation in the
year to December, 1965.
Bryant Bros., although the smaller of
the two companies, was the vehicle for
the merger. Bryant shareholders hold
$570,000 of the $1,201,000 new capital.
APV Co. Ltd., of England, with which
Bryant has been associated for 29 years,
holds just under 20 percent of Bell Bryant
capital.
Ordinary capital of $1,231,000 is sup-
ported by reserves of $856,504 (over half
of which are share premiums created by
the merger). Outside shareholders,
$233,530, are worthy preference share-
holders in James Bell.
The 50c shares have sold this year to
date between 83c and 92c, their peak being
the current price, giving a dividend yield
of 5.4 percent and earnings yield an attrac-
tive 12.2 percent. The export side of the
business appears to have the greatest pro-
pensity for growth.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Pye’s New Merchandising
Present share price probably justified
THE most recent announcements by Pye
Industries Limited related to its
activities outside the field of domes-
tic appliance manufacture. Bendix-Tecnico
won a contract to supply automatic direc-
tion-finding systems for the RAAF’s new
Macchi trainer for $500,000; and a new
division, the Gemco division, has been
added to Pye Industries by the purchase
of Gemco Pty. Ltd., a manufacturer of
power take-off boxes and lighting systems.
However, on April, 1, 1966, the beginning
of Pye’s 1966/67 year, the company an-
nounced a new merchandising campaign
which provides free service of all its appli-
ances for four years after purchase. It
seems that, while the list price will remain
unchanged, the wholesale price will be
increased and Pye will control, to some
extent, the amounts offered for trade-ins
by retailers.
The share market seems to have viewed
this latter announcement with a certain
amount of concern, probably because Mal-
leys and Kelvinator had been forced to
abandon their earlier attempts to control
the prices of their products by reducing
the list prices. On April 1 the last sale
took place at $1.35, but, in the following
week (April 1 was a Friday) the price
ranged from $1.30 down to $1.20, firfishing
at $1.25. Turnovers, which had fallen
from 16,700 in January to 7200 in Feb-
ruary to 1900 in March, suddenly rose to
7500 in the first week of April and were
over 4000 in the second week.
Clearly the result of this new merchan-
dising approach will not be knowi> for
some time. The annual report, which is not
due until next September, will cover the
12 months to March 31, 1966, and, judg-
ing by the interim announcement last
November, it is quite possible that there
will be a fall in profits. No indication
of current profitability is likely to be given
for another four months, so an attempt
must be made to assess the value of
Pye’s shares on the basis of a profit his-
tory which ended 12 months ago.
Although, by any standards, profits have
been erratic over the years to
March 31, 1965, it is nevertheless clear
that there was a considerable lift in profit
in the 1962/3 year. The reafsons for this
sudden increase are not clear, but in retro-
spect the events of note that occurred in
1962 were the formation of P.I.L. Finance
Pty. Ltd. and the Business Traders Ltd.
and an expansion of Bendix-Tecnico
(Automotive) to supply carburettors to
B.M.C. On the other hand, the 1962/3
year seems to have been the year when
bad debts first became significant. The
directors’ report on that year states: “. . .
profits were affected by the writing-off of
bad and doubtful debts amounting to
£239,333 ($478,666). This amount is
high as compared with the experience dur-
ing previous years . . .” If the whole of
this write-off was charged against profits
for the year, pre-tax consolidated profit
would have been $1,939,000 approximately
prior to the write-off, i.e., 115 percent
greater than the 1960/1 pre-tax profit
and 137 percent greater than the 1961/2
pre-tax profit.
JN the following two years, the amount
of the write-off has not been disclosed,
but the amounts provided against the year’s
profit for bad and doubtful debts were
$146,000 in 1963/4 and $276,000 in
1964/5, according to the directors’ reports.
The low tax provisions of those years
would suggest that further substantial
write-offs have occurred, although at the
last annual meeting the chairman said that
the 1964/5 write-off was very much less
than that of 1963/4. As the sales subsidiary
seems to be only lightly involved with
H. G. Palmer, it is possible that the bad
debt problems will remain at this lower
level.
The sub-subsidiary, Bendix-Tecnico
(Automotive), has received favorable ref-
erence in the annual report almost every
year over the past five years, and it seems
that the business of this company has
expanded very considerably. Since obtain-
ing the B.M.C. contract in 1962, it has
obtained contracts for the supply of car-
burettors to Volkswagen and to Chrysler.
It has also commenced the manufacture of
fuel pumps, and in 1964/5 it achieved full
volume production in engine oil filters as
well as designing and manufacturing twin
carburettors. One would expect that
profits would also be expanding. One
might hope to get some idea from the
figure for minority interests appearing in
the consolidated profit statements since
Bendix-Tecnico (Automotive) is 85 percent
owned by Bendix-Tecnico, which is 51
percent owned by Pye. The position is
complicated, however, by the fact that
Petbow Pty. Ltd., which was formed in
1961, was also only partly owned until
1964, and in 1965 Pye acquired a con-
trolling interest in Vincent Bros. Pty. Ltd.,
which also suggests a partial ownership.
Even if we make the assumption that
these two subsidiaries did not make any
contribution to profits in the -relevant
years (1961, 1962, 1963, and'l96s), we
still have the problem of the 15 percent
outside interest in Bendix-Tecnico (Auto-
motive). Guessing somewhat, it seems un-
likely that in 1962/3 year the Bendix-
Tecnico group contributed morq than
$300,000 to the group after-tax profits of
$816,000 and in 1964/5 the contribution
might well have been less than $135,000
out of a total of $1,002,000 (before the
provision for bad and doubtful debts).
The other major subsidiaries are all
wholly owned and are engaged in various
fields of activity. F. W. Davey is one of
the largest manufacturers of small and
medium-sized pumps and also a major
producer of domestic water-pressure sys-
tems. Tecnico Electronics produces printed
circuitry and electronic sub-assemblies.
Colville Wireless Equipment seems to be
engaged in the manufacture of specialised
equipment for various industries —the food-
processing industry was mentioned in the
1964 address to shareholders, and the 1965
annual report refers to a lipping press
used in the manufacture of particle board.
The proportion of consolidated profit
contributed by these other subsidiaries can
only be variable and it would be difficult
to make a guess. The finance companies,
after making a loss in 1963/4, probably
made little contribution in 1964/5. The
contribution of the Bendix-Tecnico group
was down in that year also, so I suspect
that the parent company and its sales
subsidiary were the major contributors in
1964/5.
While the Australian Pye group is clearly
working toward less dependence on the
consumer durables market, it seems that
there may still be some way to go before
this market is responsible for less than 50
percent of the group profit. For the
present, I think it is appropriate to assume
that Pye can earn about 21 cents per
share, but it seems highly unlikely that
it Mill pay more than 5 cents per share in
the foreseeable future. So, while a price
of $1.25 may look low in that it gives a
price/eamings multiple of only 6.0 (!!),
it may be justified on the grounds of divi-
dend yield and past variations in per share
earnings.

How do you steer a cable ship
with your arms folded?
Automatic navigation at work. C. S. Mercury is just one of the ships in the Cable
& Wireless fleet fitted with automatic steering equipment made by S. G. Brown
Ltd. It incorporates the Arma-Brown gyro-compass, the smallest of its type in
existence. The accuracy and speed of response of this equipment simplifies the
complex manoeuvres called for in cable work.
Hawker Siddeley know how.
S. G. Brown—that’s the name for automatic steering
gear. It sets ships on the selected course and keeps
them there. No hands needed. Hawker Siddeley build
this equipment at the S. G. Brown factory in Watford,
England. Ships throughout the world rely on it.
The world relies on Hawker Siddeley in many
other ways, too —through the wide range of tech-
nological products that make Hawker Siddeley a
world-size industrial group.
These products go down on the farm —haul trains
—probe space—equip power stations —power ships—
roll roads—fly people—store heat—pack food—
transform electricity—fuel aircraft—and maintain a
daily turnover of $A2| million.
Navigation equipment is part of this turnover, but
only part. That’s what makes Hawker Siddeley a
group. With group power.

MAN ON THE LAND
More Wheat for Red China
THE Prime Minister, Mr. Holt, was
asked by a Vietnamese journalist how
lie could equate Australia’s military
and civil assistance to Vietnam with its
trade with Communist China. Under the
circumstances the PM’s reply was appro-
priate enough. As a good many Australians
can barely come to a satisfactory under-
standing of our paradoxical mixture of
socialism and private enterprise in farming
how could you expect a Vietnamese to
even begin to understand?
Mr. Holt is reported as having said:
“The Australian Government does not
trade with Communist China. The trading
is done by private enterprise in Aus-
tralia.”
Wheat is our most important export to
Communist China and it is sold by the
Australian Wheat Board, socialistic in con-
cept, and the wheat is subsidised by the
Australian taxpayer. On the other hand,
the wheat is grown on farms owned by
individuals who are not told (not yet,
anyway) how much wheat they can plant.
From a fundamental point of view the
PM’s reply was not a true statement of
the facts, but from the point of view of
wheatfarmers, the Country Party, and the
farmer organisations it was true.
It is pure Alice in Wonderland, of
course. Private enterprise means exactly
what I chose it to mean, no more or no
less. A better question might be: Why,
considering our involvement in Vietnam,
does Communist China wish to buy wheat
from us? This is easier to answer.
In the last year or so information about
farming in China has been available from
various sources and the picture has become
much clearer. Only a year ago there were
all kinds of theories floating around. The
tung oil theory was popular for quite some
time. This theory was that tung oil was
an extremely valuable export for China
and that she could sell this for the cash
needed to pay for wheat.
We first encountered this theory at a
farmers’ organisation meeting at which a
chap spoke at length following a trip to
China. He could not tell us exactly what
tung oil was, or why it was so valuable,
or what, in fact, it was used for. Tung oil
was the answer, he said, and the farmers
voted his talk one of the best they had
ever heard.
There are a number of variations of
the tung oil theory rice, fish, edible
oils, and so on. It is difficult to substanti-
ate any of them as the real reason for
China’s wheat purchases.
Then there was the naive China-wants-
to-be-friends theory. This was very popular
with idealists of a socialistic leaning, who
maintained that China did not really need
the wheat, but that Communism had so
lifted living standards that wheat had be-
come a justifiable addition to the diet.
Countering this was the diabolical-plot
theory. The idea here was that China was
deliberately encouraging us to increase
production to a dangerous level and would
then cut us off, with ruinous consequences
to the Australian economy.
Some six months ago, after gleaning
information about talks then going on in
Hong Kong, we predicted that the Viet-
nam involvement would not intrude to any
great extent into wheat negotiations with
China that quantity, price, and avail-
ability would remain the prime considera-
tions. Everything points to the simple fact
that China buys our wheat because she
needs it. Her agrarian revolution is no-
where near as successful as. the idealists
tell us and her own food production is
hard pressed to even keep pace with popu-
lation increase.
Added to this is the Chinese determina-
tion to press ever onwards with industrial-

A policyholder* writes—
“ Anything that can take some of the stress and worry out of export
business is of the utmost value to executives.
“This was brought home to me very forcibly during our recent difficul-
ties in a Middle East market. E.P.I.C. cover not only protected our

isation and, in so doing, limit the formerly
self-sufficient section of the population.
The collectives cannot increase production
rapidly enough, and this is a fairly
familiar story in all Communist coun-
tries. Whether the Chinese like us or not
seems an unnecessary intrusion.
According to the most recent Hong
Kong report, China now has a drought
adding to her difficulties. The usual import
quota, about six million metric tons, is
likely to be increased if the wheat is
available. Our share of this would nor-
mally be about three million tons, but the
trouble is that little will be available until
the harvest which comes in around Decem-
ber.
A Wheat Board delegation is to have
talks in Hong Kong early next month
with the agency which purchases for
Peking. The delicate task of this delega-
tion will be to convince the Chinese that
we really have not got the wheat now and
that we are not allowing Vietnam to
influence our attitude A sale of about
500,000 tons would seem a likely outcome
of the talks. But if the Chinese do not
drive a harder bargain than usual we
will be very surprised.
The International Wheat Agreement is
under great pressure. In order to clinch
the sale we will probably have to try to
undercut Canada, France, and Mexico.
Argentina, like us, has had a bad drought
and is not reckoned a strong competitor
this year.
W E always find it easier to solve other
people’s problems rather than our own.
We may have concerned ourselves too
much with the question of why China buys
and whether she will continue to buy. On
present indications we have an urgent
problem of our own.
To what extent should the Australian
taxpayer continue to subsidise wheat pro-
duction if that wheat cannot be sold at
better than the cost of production which
the Government guarantees farmers? If
the cost of production is permitted to
creep ever upwards, should not acreage
controls be acceptable as a control over
production to balance the Wheat Board
control over marketing? An alternative
might be a revision of Wheat Stabilisation.
Either course would bring enraged
from the farmers and would imperil the
Liberal Party-Country Party coalition.
This year the drought has imposed its
own form of control. There will not be,
we hope, droughts forever.
Wheat matters generally are wide open
to conjecture for a very good reason: the
Wheat Board never tells us, precisely, the
price per bushel paid by China. It is
possible to arrive at an approximate figure,
yet it could be out by millions either way.
The taxpayer is entitled to know just how
much the Wheat Board does obtain from
Communist China (per bushel) for then,
and then only, can the taxpayer judge
Wheat Stabilisation fairly. The farmers
say it is none of the taxpayers’ business.
Do not taxpayers realise that primary
producers are the people who really matter
in Australia?


Dear E.M.I:
It’s time you met
Miss Amory
Her TV set's had it. Who’s going to sell her the next one?
Miss Amory’s a very pleasant woman —
the adopted aunt of half the surrounding
neighbourhood; but (like thousands of women
like her in the Sydney and Melbourne
viewiiig areas) the evening companion she
most depends on is her TV set.
Although she doesn’t know it yet,
her set has had it. She’ll just have to get
another one. Will it be yours? Or will it be a
competitive job that she saw the man
selling so often on TV?
The answer’s up to you.
The two “Nines” put your name before the
largest captive audience in Australia . . .
seven nights a week. And they’re
all potential buyers—wide open to the potent
selling skills of the two “Nines,”
which are always at your
service. Interested?

Adopting Pangola Grass
Australia jumps on the bandwagon
ONLY 15 years ago scarcely anyone in
the world knew about Pangola grass
(Digitaria decumbens). The species
had actually been discovered and named
in the 19205. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture had brought it to the New
World from its ancestral home in the
Pongola River valley, East Transvaal, in
1935, but did not release it to farmers
until some years later. Today it is one
©f the most important forages in tropical
and subtropical parts of the world.
More than half a million acres have
already been planted in Florida alone and
other south-eastern States of the U.S.A.
also have large acreages. The livestock
industry of the Caribbean depends
greatly on this new grass and most coun-
tries of Central America and many in
South America are enthusiastically extend-
ing their planting programs. Mauritius,
Ghana, and the Congo now grow it. Hong
Kong, Taiwan (Formosa), India, and
the Philippines—all hard-pressed to im-
prove their livestock industries have
introduced it.
CSIRO brought it to Australia from
Hawaii in 1954 and after the cuttings
were released from quarantine put down
the first experimental plots in 1957. Alto-
gether some several hundred acres are
now growing in widely scattered places
throughout coastal Queensland, some of
the plantings having been made by enter-
prising landholders. Probably in the
British West Indian Territories the name
of the grass was softened from its original
Pongola to Pangola.
This story of world-wide adoption of
a new species within a decade must be
unique in the annals of agriculture. Does
such haste merely reflect the speed of
modern communication systems or does
the grass possess really important advan-
tages? Overseas research and farmers’
experience leave no doubt that in many
situations it is indeed an outstanding
plant. Australian research on the species
has so far amounted to only one detailed
study— at Beerwah in south-eastern
Queensland. The results generally sup-
port the overseas findings but emphasise
that the grass needs plenty of moisture
and warmth if it is to achieve its capa-
bilities.
In the tropics and subtropics soil
nitrogen is normally very low and its
level must be lifted by one means or
another if the productivity of these areas
is to be raised appreciably. In this con-
text one of the most important attributes
of Pangola grass is that it is a most
efficient user of nitrogen. This was borne
out at Beerwah, where up to 80 percent
of the nitrogen in the form of urea applied
to the soil was recovered from the plants.
Because of its ready assimilation of nitro-
gen, Pangola grass is, therefore, one of the
world’s most rewarding grasses on which
to apply nitrogenous fertiliser.
Another prominent feature of this grass
is high yield. This character, too, was
much in evidence at Beerwah, although
the district by no means provides an ideal
environment for optimum growth of the
species. Thus, dry-matter yields up to
20,0001 b. per acre per year were obtained,
sufficient to carry three beasts. Such a
stocking rate would be well beyond the
present carrying capacity of the district,
where the existing grass-legume pastures
generally support but one beast to the
acre. In Florida, Pangola grass pastures
frequently produce more than 10001 b. per
acre P er Y ear of P rime quality steer beef,
Both cattlemen and scientists attest that
Pangola grass is highly palatable. Sheep
relish it also. Consequently, it is fortunate
that the grass will withstand intensive
grazing. In fact, its nutritive value is im-

proved by rotational heavy grazing. The
high beef production figures mentioned
were obtained under a 28-day grazing
cycle. Shorter cycles are reputed to cause
the grass to become too high in protein
content and too low in energy, whereas
longer cycles produce the reverse effect.
During the Beerwah experiment the crude
protein content varied from about 4 p.c.
to nearly 12 p.c. When the grass has been
well fertilised, its crude protein content
has been found to reach 24 p.c. Cattle do
well on fodder that contains about 10 p.c.
protein.
In north-eastern Australia it is expected
that mixed pastures of Pangola grass and
a legume will be laid down. The legume
would tend to keep the protein content of
the grass suitably high. Since the species
is particularly aggressive when not re-
stricted by lack of moisture or warmth
it has often proved impossible overseas
to get a legume to grow with it. However,
prevailing temperatures are rather lower
than Pangola grass finds ideal in most
of our subtropical areas and legumes can
be expected to compete with it under our
conditions. Swards containing white clover,
Lotononis or Desmodium have already
been established experimentally in Queens-
land.
On the debit side, apart from the fact
that the species needs a fairly high mini-
mum temperature and plenty of water
in order to grow, it has to be propagated
vegetatively by means of rooted or non-
rooted cuttings. However, a technique for
planting large areas has been devised in
Jamaica and employed successfully in
Taiwan as well. The grass is simply
chopped up into fairly small pieces which
are broadcast over a roughly prepared
seedbed. They are then partly covered by
tractor-harrowing.

Some Quotes of the Week
One was not harmless
WITH quotes of the week becoming almost a statutory requirement for every paper
and magazine these days, I thought I might lose my job if I didn’t keep an ear
alert for any mots justes—with a financial twist, of course. My reward came
unexpectedly, at a rather sombre business lunch the other day.
“In Manila,” intofted the Distinguished
Overseas Visitor, “they think only in terms
of provident funds.” Not quite the sort
of thing that I’ve come to associate with
Manila. Still times do . change. And, to be
fair, the speaker was addressing a stony-
faced lot of people who run superannuation
funds.
Not all quotes of the week are as harm-
less, unfortunately. Take the brick that
Aberfoyle directors dropped this week
when they revealed that they hadn’t yet
been able to sell their 1.2 million Western
Titanium shares. Just a few weeks ago the
same Aberfoyle directors announced that
they had “arranged” to sell these shares
privately. Did this private sale fall through
or by “arranged to sell” did the directors
mean “decided to sell”?
It is time someone told these directors
to choose their language more carefully.
It’s not the first time that their share-
holders have had cause for complaint about
their directors’ statements. Now, unless
they can explain themselves more satisfac-
torily, they’ll be getting a reputation for
being very naughty boys who deserve more
than a good spanking from the Stock Ex-
changes or the Registrars of Companies.
My own interest in this matter is, of
course, rather personal. I bought 400
Western Titanium contribs. back in Feb-
ruary at $1.15! Now, thanks to Aberfoyle,
they’re under a dollar. Still, one mustn’t
be too greedy. Consolidated Rutile and
Woodside were more than making up for
the Aberfoyle-Western Titanium business,
Consolidated Rutile will, I hope, go
higher but I decided to take a very good
and quick profit on my 2000 “baby” Wood-
sides when they reached 20 cents. The
profit of $126 in just one week was too
good to leave on paper. I don’t know
whether it’s the tax minimisers, Continental
Oil, or someone else who is responsible for
the run on Woodside. Whoever it is, may I
say thank you.
This week I also took the opportunity
to sell some of the all-too-numerous stocks
in my portfolio that have failed to make
any headway. First to go were W. R. Car-
penter and Riverina Television, each for
small losses. These two sales, plus the
Woodsides, brought in $1206, which put
me in a good liquid position even though
I owed $5O on last week’s purchases. The
Carpenters I switched into Wunderlichs
and the Riverina Television into Steel
Mills.
Old Wunderlich has been battling to
improve its earning rate the past few
years. But for four years it couldn’t get
above 17 percent. Dividend has been
steady at percent for even longer—ten
years, in fact. Last month directors sur-
prised by raising the dividend (for the
year ended February) to 15 percent.
The last time Wunderlich paid a 15 per-
cent dividend was back in 1955, when
earning rate was nearly 40 percent. It
seems too much to expect that the earning
rate has been restored to that sort of level
in the latest year. All directors have said
so far is that profit for the year should
show an “appreciable” increase. However,
it does seem likely that earning rate must
have got up toward 25 percent to justify
a 15 percent dividend. And that would
represent a profit rise of something
approaching 50 percent. In anticipation
of such a rise, I bought 200 at $2.60. At
this price, incidentally, the dividend yield
is nearly 6 percent, which in itself seems
enough to warrant a higher price from a
stock of Wunderlich’s standing.
Next I turned to Steel Mills, which, at
68 cents, is yielding over 7 percent.
Admittedly this company had a patchy
record until it closed its little rolling mill
at Villawood in 1962 and started produ-
cing steel mesh instead. Since then profits
have been rising nicely: $75,000 in 1963,
$106,000 in 1964, and $123,000 last year.
Capital has not been increased during this
period, so that earning rate has been com-
ing up well, too, and last year was 18.5
percent. Profits showed a further “substan-
tial” rise in the first half of the current
year. Now any company that describes its
profit rise as “substantial” is likely to catch
my eye. So I bought 400.
Then came the British Budget, with its
varied implications for Australian com-
panies. Among those to benefit from this
Budget will be fny old friends at Hanimex,
who will be glad to see the so-called import
tax finally removed in October-November.
Pre-Budget fears, coupled with the pros-
pect of little or no profit rise this year,
have brought the Hanimex shares down
from $1.69 to $1.40 in recent months. At
this they yield 7 percent from the 20 per-
cent dividend that should still be twice
covered by profits this year. And while
the rate of profit growth may steady off
this year, Hanimex’s enterprising manage-
ment is not to be underestimated. So, the
morning after the U.K. Budget, I bought
300 while they were still onlf $1.42.
SOLD
400 Riverina TV, 75c, $294.
2000 Woodside, 20c, $392.
200 W. R. Carpenter, $2.63, $526.
BOUGHT
400 Steel Mills, 68c, $278.
200 Wunderlich, $2.60, $531.
300 Hanimex, $1.42, $435.
These purchases soon disposed of my
$l2OO and put me $BB into the red again.

MEDICINE IN ANCIENT EGYPT —one of a series of
oil paintings . © 1958-59 — Parke , Davis & Company
Great Moments in Medicine
Clothed in spotless linens and wearing a wig,
as became the dignity of his status, an Egyptian
physician of 1500 B.C. administers to a patient
with symptoms of lockjaw. This highly respected
practitioner could rely only on his personal
skill, judgment, and experience to combat such
dreaded killers as tetanus.
Today, 3500 years later, due to advances in
pharmaceutical research, tetanus is no longer a
source of fear. Today’s physician employs effec-
tive immunizing agents to protect you and
your family from tetanus, polio, and other
infectious killers.
Parke-Davis scientists are proud of their place
in the living history of modern medicine, help-
ing to provide the people of the world with
the better health and longer life that come
with better medicines.

Omega Constellation. Requires no winding. Can be worn while swimming or golfing. The calendar feature is invaluable when dating letters and cheques.
As illustrated. * In ISct. gold with ISct.gold bracelet $720 (£360).
0M6611
Few men are destined to receive the new Constellation
-the finest Chronometer Omega has ever made
Gravity-powered rotor winds the Constellation as you wear it. Pre-tested for 360 hours, in 5 wrist-positions,
the Constellation Chronometer is Omega’s finest watch . . . built for a lifetime of proud possession.
They make it with love. Ask Omega
craftsmen about the Constellation and
they will talk like proud parents.
Because they have an inborn love of
fine craftsmanship.
They gift it with accuracy. Skill and ex-
perience tell them that an error of no
more than one-ninth the diameter of a
hair can seriously affect accuracy and
durability. Therefore they work
and think in thousandths of mil-
limeters.
They endow it with long life. They know
that friction is the deadly enemy of
longevity. That high-speed metal-to-
metal contact can produce wear. That
one tiny particle of dust is dangerous
to a watch mechanism. Therefore they
polish the moving parts until they
gleam like mirrors. Furnish the watch
with jewelled bearings. “Scrub” the 1
components ultrasonically and chem-
ically, 1215 times in all. Work in
spotless, hygienic surroundings.
They put it to the test. Each Constell-
ation must prove its accuracy during
360 hours in a Swiss Institute for
Official Chronometer Tests; it must
also receive a certificate endorsed
“Especially Good Results.” This is the
highest accuracy rating the Institute
can confer.
They place it in trustworthy hands. You
won’t find an Omega Constellation in
every jeweller’s shop. Its sale has been
entrusted only to jewellers who thor-
oughly understand and love watches.
The Omega jeweller is inspired by the
same pride and enthusiasm as the
Omega craftsman. That is why he
consistently recommends. — and sells ■ —-
