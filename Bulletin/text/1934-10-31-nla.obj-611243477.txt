As a newspaper “The Sunday Mail” speaks for itself, and the average net
circulation for April (42,696), May (44,006) and June (46,300) bears testimony
to the ever-widening circle of readers of Queensland’s great Sunday news-
paper-magazine and to the ready appreciation with which it is received
wherever it goes.
The consistently increasing popularity of “The Sunday Mail” renders
necessary its inclusion in every national advertising campaign planned for
the Queensland market. Used in conjunction with “The Courier Mail,”
Queensland’s greatest daily, it gives a combination unequalled in coverage
and lowness of cost. Further particulars gladly supplied on request.

The Week’s Best: —
BUCHAN’S STUDY
OF THE
SUPER YEOMAN
Adding a com-
panion portrait to
hi s “Montrose”
with a 500-page-
length Oliver
Cromwell, John
Buchan begins with a chapter that might
stand as a classic example of starting off
on the wrong foot. An attempt to set
the stage for his people, it is indefinite
and windy work, serving no useful pur-
pose, unless it be to prepare the reader
for the worst.
Once he gets down off these draughty
stilts, the book immediately begins to
look an uncommon good one. There is
none of the sparkling audacity of a
Guedalla, but there is a tone which more
inspires confidence. The keynote is that
there is no parallel in history to this
man of action who had so strong an
instinct of mercy and kindness. Buchan
relates from Cromwell’s character also
the full story of his intense Englishness
and equally in-
tense religious-
n e s s. Yet,
strangely
enough, he fails
to infer the full
significance of
those forces in
their relation-
ship with Crom-
well’s acts.
Instead, when
the instirtet for
mercy and kind-
ne s s suffered
eclipse, as in the
horseplay at the
signing of
Charles’s death-
warrant and the
JOHN BUCHAN.
butchery at Drogheda, Buchan resorts to
pleading his hero’s ill-health. Of the one,
“The man was physically and mentally
overstrung,” explains Buchan. Of the
other, “He was in bad health,” Buchan
explains.
An ingenious interpreter of history—-
James Kemble, in “Idols and Invalids”
—has explained Jeffrey’s ferocity in the
gritty light of that excellent butcher’s
stone in the bladder. It has interest as
a contribution to the spreading science
of medical journalism, and so has
Buchan’s substitute for the logical con-
clusion of his own reading of Cromwell
—that Cromwell’s Englishness and reli-
giousness were so intense that the quality
of mercy, squeezed between them, could
not help but look very strained indeed.
Both insisted that he rid England of
Charles, and both instructed his on-
slaught upon Ireland. To say, a§ Buchan
further does in groping after explana-
tions that will not oversmirch his hero,
that Cromwell went to Ireland “uncon’
scious of the long, black history of
spoliation and oppression,” and much
suchlike stuff, is plainly to do an injus-
tice to Cromwell’s intelligence. He was
a simple man, but not in that sense.
Apart from such moments, in which
the novelist’s sentimentalism would seem
to obscure the historian’s logic, Buchan
has made a most convincing portrait;
one fit to stand beside such recent tradi-
tional touchstones as Benson’s “Edward
V 11.,” Churchill’s “Marlborough” and
Neale’s “Elizabeth.” The great narrative
is finely controlled, the battle scenes and
other picturesque items well depicted,
and the leading figure bodies forth a con-
vincingly fixed reality. The seeker after
a real Cromwell will not better it.
RELIGION OF
A SIMPLE
SCIENTIST
A notable point
made by Buchan
is in differentiat-
ing the religious-
ness of Cromwell
from the Puritan
religion about him. He reads Crom-
well’s religiousness as a tremendously
personal thing ; not a creed accepted be-
cause Cromwell was born and educated
to it, but something of his own finding.
It is the one thing—apart from the sub-
lime simplicity common to greatness —
which the inspired yeoman might be said
to have in common with the figure pro-
jected in an even more compelling bio-
graphy, David Reichinstein’s Albert Ein-
stein. In all superficial aspects differ-
ences leap out like spearheads: Crom-
well the man of action, Einstein the
thinker ; the Puritan, the Jew : the man
of war, the pacifist ; the dictator, the
opponent of dictatorship ; the national
hero, the exile ; the leader, the teacher ;
the horsethief, the impersonation of ethi-
cal conduct; the yeoman politician, the
creative scientist; the Englander, the
internationalist. The list might be
doubled ; and contrast could hardly go
further.
Even their religiousness is vastly dif-
ferent in color, and each color strongly
individualistic. Just as Cromwell was not
a conventional Puritan, Einstein is not
a Jew in any traditional sense: he has
denied being one at all. His sort of reli-
giousness is one that conventional
churchmen might insist has no relation
to religion whatever. Its church is the
writing-table, the studio, the research-
room: actually, in Reichinstein’s phrase,
it represents “the severance of the reli-
gious state of feeling from the substance
of religion.” Einstein himself has called
it “cosmic religiousness,” but the tag is
unimportant. It is simply that lonely reli-
EINSTEIN.
giousness which compels and sanctifies
the activity of the research worker and
the artist, and which distinguishes these
from the dilettante of high and low
degree, that flourishing tribe of God’s
invalids, of whom Australia appears to
have at least her share.
Reichinstein asserts that in place of
the disappearing ancestral religion, which
united the Jewish masfc, Einstein, with
this concept of religiousness, supplies
what is destined to be the new religion
of that mass. He might—if anyone
can believe that any mass is at all
likely to accept so individualistic a con-
ception. However that may be, Reich-
instein gives a comprehensive and clari-
fying account of the operation of this
potent religiousness in one of the greatest
of living men.
Unlike Buchan’s polished utterance, it
is a book, in this “authorised” transla-
tion, utterly devoid of anything that even
begins to look like literary finish. It
reads like a collection of paragraphs
written in odd hours of inspiration and
stuck together in half an hour of none ;
and the proof-reading was evidently done
in the dark at the Institute for the Blind.
Still, it manages to present art under-
standing portrait of Einstein, with some
explanation of the nature of his scientific
achievements and contributions to inter-
national thought; a pupil’s strong im-
pression of the master’s powerful and
gentle personality, and a good outline
account of the significant occurrences of
Einstein’s life, including his virtual ban-
ishment, which is one of the most illu-
minating statements Hitlerism has so far
made concerning itself.

Masefield on
“The Bulletin”
“The Bulletin
has done more to
encourage and
inspire poetry
than any other
newspaper ever
founded.”
This is the dictum of John Masefield,
expressed in an interview with the Mel-
bourne representative of The Bulletin.
“Of course, its greatest encouragement
and its greatest inspiration have been in
Australia,” he added, “but its influence
has extended beyond the boundaries of
this continent. Among the people who
count in poetry in England and America,
the name of The Bulletin has long been
known, and by many of them its poetry
has been read and admired.
“The only other paper which I can
compare with The Bulletin in this re-
spect is the London ‘Daily Chronicle’
when it was controlled by Massingham
and Ne vinson. Those men set out de-
liberately to print a paper which would
definitely encourage good literature, and
they succeeded. But that was long ago,
before the Boer War, about which they
took the unpopular side.
“I attribute the success of The Bulle-
tin to its Australia-wide circulation. It
is wonderful to see that men working for
their living in
r e m o t e spots,
often under con-
ditions of ex-
treme privation,
would send their
poetry or story
a thousand miles
to the office of
The Bulletin.
The paper cir-
culated through-
out the whole
area of Aus-
tralia and it
drew it's contri-
butions from
the same wide
spaces. Those
men did not

belong, all of them or apparently many
of them, to what are known as the
educated classes.
“That is another explanation of The
Bulletin’s success, for it is not an edu-
cation in the conventional sense which
makes a poet. .
“I knew the work of The Bulletin
poets better in the days when I used to
frequent, newspaper offices and see the

the poems of Lawson, Dyson, Banjo

At his request, the Laureate was given
a brief outline of the careers of these and
other Australian poets.
That is as I thought,” he observed.
“These men come from all classes of

laborers. You never know where you’re

Pure Fiction
from a
Maorilander
The wrapper of
Alan Mulgan’s
“Spur of Morn-
ing” states that it
is the long, full-
scale novel of
Maoriland life for which so many
readers have been waiting. The assump-
tion that Maoriland life is dealt with is
more the publisher’s than the author’s.
Mr. Mulgan is a Maorilander, and it is
possible to guess that his Eden is Auck-
land and his Wellesley Wellington ; to
trace, in this largely political narrative,
some resemblance between Braxton and
Seddon, and a close parallel between the
programmes of Mr. Mutgan’s Liberal-
Labor party and that of the followers of
Ballance. But for the most part the
author has been assiduous in an aim to
cut loose from history and from local
color. There is no mention of Maoris,
of ferns, of kauris, or of flax.
The Lib.-Labs. don’t sweep in with a
big majority, as actually happened, in
1891, but hold office for the first time,
tenuously, by virtue of two or three in-
dependent votes, when the century is
well advanced. And, most surprisingly,
a glimpse of what seems to be Mt.
Egmont is obtained on entering the
harbor of the capital.
The story follows a much-used recipe.
The son of poor parents, having acquired
a high school education and a taste for
the classics, and having distinguished
himself in Rugby football, gets elected
to Parliament in the Lib.-Lab. interest,
becomes a Minister of the Crown almost
immediately apd falls in love with a rich
squatter’s daughter. She spurns him for
a while, but falls into his arms on page
362, just after he has been defeated in
an election, the story ending on page
364. Both the hero and his lady-love
are uncompromising idealists—in fact, all
the nice charac-
ters are. But
the nice charac-
ters and the
nasty ones
(there are only
two or three of
these, and
they’re very in-
cidental) seem
to have been
drawn with a
conscious effort
to avoid paint-
ing port raits
from life, pos-
sibly because the
Dominion is so
very small and
narrow. It is a
pity that this
should have
been thought
necessary, but
perhaps the
author was wise.
If but one of
the real person-
ages who influ-
enced the history of the period dealt with
had been allowed into these chaste pages
the whole balance of the thing would
have been destroyed, and its appeal to
members of the Victoria League and
readers of the “Morning Post” utterly
ruined. As it stands it is such a colonial
romance as might have been written by
any nice-minded Englishman.
A. D. WYLIE.
Pre-centenary
Visitors
to Melbourne
In Victorian : a
Visitors’ Book, by
John Oldham and
Alfred Stirling
(Brown, Prior; per
Booklovers’; 55.).
the authors have written a series of
engaging essays on early visitors to Mel-
bourne which give a complete picture
of the city’s first century.
The first distinguished visitor was
Robert Lowe, Lord Sherbrooke, who set
his foot on the site of Batman’s fair vil-
lage nine years after the latter worthy.
Already Melbourne was having its first
taste of a depression, and things were so
cheap that Lowe regretted he did not
have a few thousand pounds to become
owner of the place.
Lord Salisbury (1852) was the first
future Prime Minister of Great Britain
to visit Melbourne, which he found
thronged with the newly-rich ; the streets
were the scene of daily and nightly
bacchanals, and there were only two con-
stables to enforce the law, the rest
having resigned to go to the dig-
gings. Nevertheless, the pious char-
acter of the citizens was already mani-
fest and even extended to the Police
Commissioner, Armstrong. One Sunday
Salisbury accompanied this holy man to
Mount Alexandria, the Mecca of the
goldseekers, and there
they met two men
carrying bags of the
precious earth which
they intended washing.
Armstrong took the
bags and scattered their
contents on the ground,
for it was Sunday, on
which day no good Vic-
torian worketh; and
the men took this as
meekly as their descen-
dants to-day take the
stoppage of trams and
trains on Sunday.
General Booth ar-
rived in
1891, and at
the Exhibi-
tion hypno-
tised 20,000
people, who,
after his ser-
mon, flung themselves on the ground with
muffled sobs; but the Boom had burst,
and the General’s cable to headquarters
was a laconic “Proceeds, £400.” On a
subsequent visit he was banqueted at
the Methodist Ladies’ College, where, in
his own words,
after about 100 nabobs, male and female,
had marched in and seated themselves at
the table, heavily laden with turkeys, etc.,
the young college girl students, dressed in
the highest and, I think, the loudest cos-
tumes, came along frizzed and curled
and adorned in the most approved worldly
style.
The horrified General refused to speak
until they had stopped eating: he then
proceeded to go for all his might at “the
trifling young creatures.”
The first distinguished writer to visit
Melbourne was Henry Kingsley (1853),
author of “Geoffrey Hamlyn,” the story
of early colonial life which has been
undeservedly eclipsed by the fame of
Marcus Clarke’s epic. Kingsley was
penniless when he arrived, and was
penniless when he departed five years
later, though he was richer in the
desperate experiences which formed the
subject-matter of his subsequent novels,
material from Australian residents of
Reading Gaol.
In 1871 Anthony Trollope visited the
city at the height of his reputation.
They blow a good deal in Queensland
I lie remarked], they blow loudly in New
South Wales, but the blast of the trumpet
as heard in Victoria is louder than all the
blasts —and the Melbourne blast beats all
the other blowing of that proud colony.
Wherefore, being a conscientious writer,
he kept his own counsel in Mel-
bourne.
In 1891 came Rudyard Kipling, who
was then only 25, but he was not
an unqualified success as a literary
lion ; his brusque-
ness may have
been shyness, but it
was taken for con-
ceit, and possibly
he was annoyed
because a lady ad-
mirer told him that
when she had in-
fluenza his books
were the only thing
that did her good.
In 1891 Sarah
Bernhardt dropped
in to ring down the
curtain on the
mad revels of
th e Boom.
Sarah’s open-
ing in “La
Dame aux
Camelias” at
the Princess
was an amaz-
mg and hysterical spectacle. Melbourne
even torgave her for going on a shooting
party to Launching Place in a Russian
costume on the Sabbath and for charter-
ing a special train on another holy day.
Shortly after her departure the financial
structure began to collapse, but “Thank
Ood, people were heard to say, “we
had Sarah first!”

this Page’s acclamation as the most
artistically-finished and best-looking
half-crown’s worth to hand this year,

lovely. Admirably printed and its color-

anthology of the beauty about us.
Gentlemen of the Night, by Stephen
Maddocks (Collins ; 7s. 6d.). A secret-
service thriller, set in Naples and Malta.
Abundant thrills and action.
Crack of Whips, by H. A. Manhood
(Cape ; Angus and Robertson ; 7s. 6d.).
Short stories, slight, but finely done,
especially the longer ones concerned
with rod-fishing in Ireland, the last of
these and of the book a particularly
bright gem.
The Bowstring Murders, by Carter
Dickson (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.), are per-
petrated in a fifteenth-century castle, fur-
nished chiefly with armor, on the East
Anglian coast. The presence of a male film
star, a Harvard professor and another
visitor, in addition to the heir, an attrac-
tive maid and suchlike, provides ample
complications. A rattling good thriller,
extra generous in the number of mur-
ders—there are three of them—and, as
so many of these things are nowadays, a
jolly good piece of swift writing.
The Scarlet Beast, by Francis Gerard
(Angus and Robertson ; 7s. 6d.). Though
it bears evidefice of having been written
in haste (“Fabius knew he was going to
die and welcomed his approaching end
gladly. He had lived during the last
eighteen years as a duty to his daugh-
ter”; and much
similar st u ff),
this is a very,
readable histori-
cal romance of
the ultra-highly-
colored sort set
in the times of
Hannibal. Its
author has no
fear of letting
himself go
(“ ‘Well struck,
old vixen!’
yelled the bailiff,
and flung him-
self forward as
a br o adsword
transfixed the
nurse from
breast to
back.”), and he
certainly keeps
the reader mov-
ing through a
welter of
wars, sackings,
torturings and
love.

WAS IT WORTH WHILE?
A Roman crowd would have enjoyed the
England-Australia air race. It might
have brightened the intervals by throw-
ing some of the hoarser and more in-
accurate radio announcers to the lions,
but it would have agreed that the race
followed the traditions of the arena. Gal-
lant young lives were risked, and two,
those of H. D. Gilman and J. K. Baines,
were lost. In the general excitement no-
body troubled to send an urgent wire to
the bereaved parents, who learned the
news when it was broadcast. The hero-
worship around the finishing line was not
interrupted to pay a moment’s tribute
to their memory.
The Australians Woods and Bennett
crashed at Aleppo, and might have
shared their fate. One engine of the
winners’ machine seized over the Timor
Sea. The retractable undercarriage of
the Mollisons’ ’plane refused to sink for
landing. If it had continued to be obsti-
nate, we should now be mourning the
Mollisons. The big experimental Dutch
Pander entered by the K.L.M. met with
the same sort of accident. Had it been a
fast-landing ’plane like the Comets, no-
thing could have saved the pilots. Twenty
machines started; within the first 5000
miles seven were out of the race, two
competitors had been killed and two hurt.
And for what? It advanced our know-
ledge of long-distance flying and the
route? No. Passenger machines have
been flying safely and regularly from
Amsterdam to Batavia for six years. There
are long-distance air lines from London
to Cape Town, from Montreal to Buenos
Aires and beyond, from Paris to San-
tiago, from Paris to Saigon. Some of
these services fly over stretches of water
greater than any encountered on the Aus-
tralian run.
Nor did the race test the endur-
ance of fliers to a point beyond
previous achievements. Wiley Post’s
lone flight round the Northern Hemi-
sphere, which occupied seven days
at speed, was more exacting. Scott
and Campbell Black were, with stops, 71
hours on the way. The pair who flew the
Fairey Napier from London to Walfisch
Bay a couple of years ago were 51\ hours
aloft without a break. The two French-
men who a few months ago flew non-
stop from New York to Syria, 5834
miles, were still longer in the air.
No new types of machine of practical
use to the world were developed. Three
were built specially for the event —D.H.
Comets. There was nothing radically
new in their design. Their general lines
suggested the Couzinet 33’s —one flew
from Paris to Noumea in 1932—re-
modelled on lessons learned from British
Army, U.S.A. and German designers. Be
this as it may, they set no new standards
in speed. Any up-to-date military hornet
such as the Hawker Fury or French Han-
riot fighter could give them 40 miles an
hour.
The Comet piloted by Scott and Camp-
bell Black won the race with an average
flying speed of 185 m.p.h., allowing for
five stops, totalling eight hours. To
Singapore (7063 miles) its average in
the air was nearer 200 m.p.h., but a
standard mail ’plane, the Douglas,
showed itself as fast with seven per-
sons and 35,000 letters aboard. The
second Comet to reach Australia was
beaten to Darwin by an obsolescent
U.S.A. Boeing transport ’bus with a
maximum speed of 200 m.p.h. and a
cruising speed of 170 m.p.h. Not a single
machine in the race matched at any stage
the performance of the trans-U.S.A.
initial Douglas flight from New York
to Los Angeles with 14 passengers, mail
and luggage in a storm —2650 miles in
13 hours 4 minutes. A special mail ex-
press—they don’t carry passengers with
urgent mails —did the trans-U.S.A. trip
in 10 hours 47 minutes.
The only really useful purpose served
by the stunt —for such it was —was to
show up the tortoise-like policy of
Senator Pearce and his colleagues, who
have allowed Australia to be saddled
with an air service to London which is
out of date as regards speed. The ’planes
to be used will average about 140 m.p.h.
against the 200 m.p.h. at which Ameri-
can and the new Dutch machines fly in
“safety and comfort”—the testimony of
Mr. Robinson, of New England Air-
ways. That the lesson has been admin-
istered by a friendly neighbor is some
balm ; but that is all.
Last December, with Fokker machines
only as fast as those to be used on the
Australian-English run, the Dutchmen
flew the 9000 miles from Amsterdam to
Batavia in 4 days 4 hours 40 minutes,
and made the homeward journey in seven
minutes less, night-and-day flying under
commercial conditions. There will be no
night flying by the Pearce aerial cara-
vans, though it is normal practice on
every modern air route. They will take
nine days from London to Batavia
against the seven days which the Dutch
line now takes. Soon Douglas machines
like that which competed in the air race
will be made standard on the Dutch
East Indies run, the schedule of which
is to be reduced, during a trial period, to
five days, Batavia-Amsterdam, and then
to four —that is, to less than half the
time to be taken over the distance by
the Australian-British mail.
The Canberra Government will not allow
foreign air companies to compete with
our subsidised mail-carriers. That is only
right. A country which has produced
Hawker, Ross Smith, Parer, Dallas,
Hinkler, Kingsford Smith, Edgar Perci-
val, Pentland and Taylor, and is turning
out youngsters like Melrose, doesn’t de-
serve to have to hang behind anybody’s
rudder. There is nothing unsafe in high-
speed, all-metal ’planes provided they are
not fast-landers. And the excuses which
are being made about cost are scarcely
valid in the light of the fact that the
England-Australia postal rate will pro-
bably be 3s. per ounce, while the fast
U.S.A. services charge 3d. per ounce for
2600 miles carriage. ,
It is urgent that the Commonwealth
Government should realise its mistake,
and, since speed is the main excuse for
an air service, set out to rectify it quickly
before the Dutch line makes a laughing-
stock of it.
THANK GOD FOR LANG!
Mr. Lang was a disaster to N. S. Wales,
but to his political opponents he was,
and is, a blessing. It is doubtful whether
they could get along without him.
By the feeling he aroused in 1931-32
and the fears he still excites, he has made
it easy for very ordinary politicians to
win seats and very ordinary Govern-
ments to win elections. He was such
a lord of misrule that things were bound
to improve immediately he was thrown
out. His opponents have collared the
credit for the improvement, and magni-
fied it by making misleading compari-
sons with the maddest Lang year. Mr.
Lang also furnishes them with an excuse
for inaction and for slipshod legislation.
In some fields they even carry on his
policy, while professing horror of Lang-
ism in every shape and form and appeal-
ing to all the prejudices which the name
summons up.
Lang policy has been continued by
the Stevens Government in the domains
of transport and food-control. As in Mr.
Lang’s time, people who cannot afford
to become motorists are forbidden to
ride in ’buses if there is a Government
tram within a mile or two of their homes,
or to see the country in service cars if
there is a Government train anywhere
in the region. As in Mr. Lang’s time also,
private cars and motor-lorries are
stopped by Government officials on the
public roads, and ordered to prove they
are not carrying passengers who have
paid fares or freight on which there is
a prohibitive tax. If the proof is not
forthcoming, they are prosecuted and
punished. In transport matters, in short',
Meddle and Muddle have become the
people’s masters, and they are more arro-
gant than they were in Mr. Lang’s time
and there are more barnacles about.
Mr. Hartigan, a railway accountant
high in Mr. Lang’s favor, though not so
high as Mr. Goode, was placed at the
head of the Railway Department. It
was pleaded on behalf of the Stevens
Government that the appointment would
secure “continuity of administration”:
that is to say, Mr. Hartigan would not
be dismissed, as Mr. Cleary was, if the
Langsters came back. Because the annual
railway loss is less than in Lang’s worst
twelvemonth (though still between
£3,000,000 and £4,000,000), the Stevens
Government gave Mr. Hartigan a thump-
ing increase in salary and has allowed the
gentleman to share his good fortune
with a parcel of heads and sub-heads of
branches, this while reporting that engine-
drivers have been getting £4 Bs. 7d.,
stationmasters £4 ss. 6d. and signalmen
£3 Bs. Id. per week. The salary-increases
are to come out of the public purse.
Mr. Hartigan grants them; the people
find the money. Mr. Lang would not
have dared to sanction such an outrage.
The metropolitan milk trade continues
to be “controlled” by the board that
Mr. Lang set up. True, the Stevens Gov-
ernment appointed a Royal Commission
(it cost £4290), which reported that the
chairman, a former manager of the Dairy
Farmers’ Co-op., had immediately be-
fore his appointment distributed large
sums, allegedly as secret rebates, which
most of the persons he mentioned denied
having received, and that, with one ex-
ception (it wasn’t Dairy Farmers), all the
board’s agents had “committed breaches
cither of the Milk Act Or of their
agency agreements”; but the Stevens
Government has made no change. While
the corresponding Melbourne board has
gone in for price-reduction when there
is a glut of supplies, so that the people
may benefit from the bounty of nature,
the retail price in Sydney has been forced
up to 7d. a quart for country milk and
Bd. for milk from the suburbs; first, by
a restriction of the market to a certain
number of districts, and now by a re-
striction of supplies within those dis-
tricts. A member of the Sydney board
has come out with a declaration of hos-
tility to reduction in the price to the
consumer and improvement in methods
of distribution, because it would mean
loss of employment and, as he put it,
“purchasing power.” In the policy laid
down by this Jack-in-office the Stevens
Government meekly concurs.
The money spent on the Milk Com-
mission was no small addition to the
already excessive cost of government
under Mr. Stevens’s rule, but there have
been many such. Although there are 15
members of this Government of account-
ants and some Ministers have very little
to do, outsiders are expensively employed
to conduct inquiries which Ministers or
select committees could manage without
cost and to the same purpose, since the
reports are always pigeonholed. The
Auditor-General publishes a catalogue of
this useless expenditure, though it is far
from complete. A Royal Commission
on new States (the second) has cost
£2,631 ; and there is a lot more to come.
These are other items on the list:
£3767 to Mr. A. E. Barton, chartered
accountant, and others for inquiries into
the affairs of Government industrial under-
takings ;
£495 to Mr. R. J. Sands, chartered
accountant, for investigating the financial
basis of country-towns’ water supply and
sewerage;
£919 to Mr. Radcliffe, public accountant,
member of the Taxation Investigation
Committee (progress payment);
£465 to Professor Copland for services
while engaged on special work for the
Government in London;
£1039 to Mr. J. Garlick for the prepara-
tion of information for use at a conference
of Premiers to consider the question of
the amendment of the Constitution (it
was not considered);
£l3OO to Mr. A. J. Gibson, consulting
engineer, and others for inquiries into
technical education;
£668 to Mr. H. W. Chancellor, chartered
accountant, and others for an inquiry into
the bread industry.
In addition, £30,340 was paid in com-
pensation, interest and costs to Lang
appointees sacked by the Stevens Gov-
ernment: £11,902 to members of the
Meat Industry Board and the rest to
minor satellites of Mr. A. B. Piddington
on the Industrial Commission. These
particular gentlemen were practically
sinecurists, but they seem to have been
got rid of very clumsily. Incidentally, the
Auditor-General states that the deficit for
1933-34 amounted to £3,779,000. Mr.
Stevens says that it was a mere
£3,208,300.
Mr. Stevens was trained as a civil
servant, and his mind retains the civil-
service bias and outlook. Before he
turned politician civil servants had great
powers and privileges in N. S. Wales, and
in one way and another he has increased
both. Having suffered the Commissioner
of Railways to levy taxes for pay-in-
creases to his headquarters staff, and
vastly extended the authority of the Com-
missioner of Taxation over his subjects,
the Stevens Government has been toying
with the notion of letting another plague
of officials loose to extort 10s. a year
from every person who has a fruit-tree
in his backyard. But, although it has
an obsequious majority and an uncritical
city press, there is a limit to what the
people will stand.
HELL.
Judge Foster, of Victoria, brewed a
peck of trouble when he told an eight-
year-old boy who predicted a grilled
hereafter for liars that “there is no hell,
and it is a shame that children should be
taught such a thing.” The “Argus”
played with the theme as a rhinoceros
with a caterpillar, asserting in the
end that “the consensus of opinion seems
to be that there is a hell of some kind.”
Other critics are certain, though they
disagree. The Master of the Methodist
University College'in Brisbane says “Hell
is an inevitable state of torment follow-
ing abandonment to sin.” His colleague
of the Anglican college says “Heaven is
love and hell is hate.” Another Anglican
pronounces hell “an unhappy condition,”
and a cautious Presbyterian remarks that
“those people who are in it know it and
others have a foot in it without knowing
it.” The Seventh Day Adventists teach
that hell, death and the grave are
the same thing.
The Scriptures aren’t much help. Hell
in old English meant the grave (“the
hidden place”) or oblivion. The word
appears 18 times in the Authorised Ver-
sion of the New Testament. Eight times
it is a translation of the Greek Hades,
which meant nothing more than the grave
or the hereafter. Once Hades is trans-
lated as the grave —in Corinthians:
O death, where is thy sting? O grave,
where is thy victory?
Eight times “hell” translates the
Aramaic geena —twice in the Sermon on
the Mount, when the Preacher said that
it was more profitable that “one of thy
members should perish” than that “thy
whole body should be cast into hell.”
As Gehenna, the Vale of Hinnom, was
the local rubbish tip and incinerator, as
familiar to the Jews as Footscray is to
the “Argus”—or rather used to be —
there is no reason to believe that the
word was used except in symbolism.
So little have the terrors of the spot
been ingrained in Judaic tradition that
the site of Ge-hinnom has never been
exactly settled —many an archaeologist
has lost part of his whiskers in dispute
about it.
The Scriptures give only one actual
picture of a gentleman doing time in
Sheol —the rich man “clothed in purple
and fine linen who fared sumptuously
every day” and apparently let Lazarus
lap up the crumbs from his table.
St. Luke tells us about him in a para-
graph which might have been written
by James Edmond. When he died and
was “in torments” in the fire he could see
Lazarus on the horizon in Abraham’s
bosom, and he called out to the old man
of Genesis to let the beggar dip his hand
in water and bring along a drink. Abra-
ham replied that the rich man had had
good things in his lifetime and Lazarus
hadn’t. In an equally illogical spirit,
the rich man asked that Lazarus be sent
back to earth to warn his brothers of
what was coming to them. The answer
was that if Moses and the prophets
weren’t enough to warn them, a little
sizzle wouldn’t do them any harm.
Mr. Foster did not make the first judi-
cial attack on hell. Those two dry
early-Victorian worthies Maule, J., and
Lord-Chancellor Westbury both im-
pugned it as an institution. The latter
said that there was nothing in the Angli-
can Church articles which “required us
to condemn as penal an expression of
hope that the ultimate pardon of the
wicked may be consistent with the will
of God,” and that a judgment of eternal
misery may not be the Divine purpose.
’Sonah —he was a Wiltshireman from
Bradford-on-Avon blessed with the Scrip-
tural name of Bethell—had his reward in
an epitaph credited to a famous solicitor,
Sir Philip Rose, who wrote of him that
“he dismissed hell with costs, and took
away from orthodox members of the
Church of England their last hope of
everlasting damnation.”
Nobody ever has returned from the
dead, but I know a good many people
who have been pretty near it. I have
been near enough myself to give a few
lifesavers an anxious hour or so, beside
being heaved into unconsciousness out
of cars and being nearly hanged by
schoolboy well-wishers. The later stages
of all these experiences were perfect
blanks, in spite of the fact that if my
peccadilloes were placed end to end they
would reach from Haman to the Hill of
Gilgal and make the Jewish Cabalists
who consigned Sabbath-breakers and
the uncircumcised to a pit 420 times
hotter than fire go searching for new
temperatures.
THE RELIGIOUS EDITOR.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Cup Comes First.
The new Parliament started badly.
Before the House elected a Speaker Mr.
Gander began to guy the Government
and his fellow-members, there being no
one to call him to order. He was a bil-
liard-marker, it seems, and for something
like an hour he indulged in billiard-
marker pleasantries, which, according to
one account, had members in “fits of
laughter,” until his supply of witticisms
ran out. Then he began reading some
of the dull harangues of Mr. Lang.
This was too much. The member for
Wide Bay (Q.) moved that the member
for Reid (N.S.W.) be no longer heard.
The Clerk of the House signified that
the motion had been carried. Mr. Bell
(Darwin) having already been nominated
for the Speakership, supporters grabbed
him and rushed him over to the Clerk,
who went through the form of declaring
him elected.
Lang Labor raised a terrific row. Words
like “burglars” and “dingoes” broke
from angry mouths; supporters of the
Speaker were characterised as “robbers” ;
someone shouted “Let’s have a fight!”
During the din Mr. Gander advanced to
the table and tried to nominate himself.
Mr. Garden (Cook), sometime of the
Communist International, “sprang to his
feet and challenged the right of the Clerk
to put the motion.” No one thought to
challenge the right of this person to be
in the House at all, or took him up when
he yelled that he had been “debarred
of his rights as a member of the House
by a servant of the House.”
With members in such a temper, dis-
passionate study of the Governor-Gen-
eral’s speech was out of the question.
Yet it would have repaid study if only
as a curiosity. After conventional refer-
ences to the visit of the Duke of Glou-
cester and to “the partial recovery from
the depression which has been achieved,”
this sentence was read:
My advisers regard with sympathy and
concern the heavy unemployment which
still persists, and propose to give this
grave and pressing problem priority over
other matters.
It inspired the Country party to sug-
gest that the House should get to busi-
ness right away. Lang Labor was of
the same mind, or pretended to be. But
this proposal did not suit the Govern-
ment which was in such a hurry to suc-
cor the unemployed. Cabinet, it seemed,
had to be in Melbourne during Cup
Week; there was business to be done
there. “Very important business,” ex-
plained the Prime Minister, and a little
pleasure withal; “I admit quite frankly
that I want to see the Cup.”
The Government will “give this grave
and pressing problem of heavy unem-
ployment priority over other matters,”
but not over the Cup.
«
The Unsplittable Vote.
The suggestion of Matthews, the new
Lang-Labor member for Leichhardt, that
Federal Labor should withdraw from all
future N.S.W. elections, “to prevent vote-
splitting,” only shows what marvellous
logicians occur on both sides of politics.
Warnings against “vote-splitting” are
noised abroad before every election by
Langites, Federal Laborites, U.A.Ps. and
Countrymen. Yet vote-splitting is im-
possible under the preferential system.
In the old days of first-past-the-post
voting, it used to be the pleasing cus-
tom of a Blue candidate to put up a
fake White candidate to split the other
fellow’s vote. If the fake happened to
be a forceful personality, he contrived
to sneak away some hundreds of votes
and the Blue would be elected, though
there was, possibly, a. 25 p.c. majority
against him. With preferential voting,
such dishonest games were squelched!
To-day, the voter marks the man he
wants in, then the man he wants in if the
first choice is out of it, and so on. In-
dividual electors make mistakes, but no
minority man (or woman) can be elected.
The majority prevails—as it should
prevail.
The real trouble about the Langites is
that they resent voters for Federal Labor
marking U.A.P. or C.P. man second in
preference instead of one of themselves.
They object to these voters having the
right which the preferential system gives
them.

It’s Called “Reform.”
The N.S.W. unemployed-relief tax on in-
come was introduced when Mr. Stevens
was the Bavinshaws’ Treasurer. The bill,
as botched—these measures are always
passed in a hurry—contained a loose
clause which was construed by the Com-
missioner of Taxation to mean that he
might impose the tax on gross income
from any country. He set about collect-
ing the necessary information; “penalties,
£lOO to £500.”
A protest was made to Mr. Stevens.
He expressed astonishment that such an
extension of the tax was contemplated
and said he would see the Commissioner
about it. If he did he took no action.
Regardless of imposts paid in the coun-
try of origin this tax on income to
which N. S. Wales has no more moral
right than a burglar has been extorted
—often with 10 p.c. fines added—for
four years. Revenue has been gained,
but population has been lost. Sojourners
from other States and British tourists
(who were struck at in spite of the agree-
ment between the British and Common-
wealth Governments for the prevention
of double tax) swore they would not
stay in N. S. Wales to be robbed.
In crude retaliation, the Victorian
Government went in for double taxation
of Victorians drawing income from other
States. It applied the thing, however,
in a restricted form, and its exactions
have been comparatively mild. Papers
produced to The Bulletin show that on
a small income from a Victorian pro-
perty derived by a Sydney man last year
the Victorian taxes (there are two) were
£2 10s., the N. S. Wales tax over £lO.
The protests of the skinned stung the
Governments concerned into action, as
it is understood in U.A.P. circles, though
not into a decision to drop double taxa-
tion once and for all—evidently (too simple
and honest a way out. Desultory discus-
sions on the subject have been proceed-
ing for two years. They have culminated
in a “reciprocal arrangement” which
establishes the vicious principle that a
State in a Federal Commonwealth may
tax income from property in another
State, though it cannot tax the property,
and which will bear more harshly on
many of the people affected (many others
were excluded from the negotiations)
than the present competition between
First and Second Robbers. This is the
“reciprocal arrangement,” as expressed
by Mr. Fitzsimons: —
Residents of Victoria will not be taxed
by N. S. Wales upon interest, rent or
dividends derived in this State, and resi-
dents of N. S. Wales will not be taxed
by Victoria upon that class of income
derived in Victoria.
Mr. Fitzsimons is a Minister without
a portfolio, the Government’s youngest
and rawest member. When he intro-
duced his bill there were, as the deputy-
leader of the Opposition protested,
“about 20 other bills” before the House,
and no copies were available. When copies
belatedly made their appearance, amend-
ments were urged on the Government
by the Taxpayers’ Association and by
Messrs. Hemsley and Nicholas, Ms.L.C.,
but the reply was that there was “no
time.” There was, however, “time” to
extend the powers of the Commissioner.
That functionary—already a law to him-
self in so many matters —has been
authorised, among other things:
To determine domicile; to adjust tax
direct with an employee where there has
been an over-payment or under-payment,
and to fix arbitrarily the amount on which
tax should be paid where an employer
fails to keep proper records.
Under the “rule” of Mr. Stevens, the
former civil servant, N. S. Wales is be-
coming a paradise for civil servants,
heading for complete government by
regulation.

Lancaster Flaunts the Red Rose.
The Lancashire boycott of Australian
farm produce in retaliation for the im-
position of duties on manufactured cot-
ton is logically dealt with by R. J. Web-
ster, general manager of the Queensland
Cotton Board, in a report to the local
Chamber of Manufactures. Webster is
not only exhaustive in proving the fallacy
of Lancashire’s arguments, but, better
still, he is clear, which many fighters for
a good cause are not.
He compares Australia with Canada,
against which Lancashire has made no
threats. Canada last year bought 46
million yards of manufactured cotton
from Lancashire, while Australia bought
145 million yards, and this despite the
fact that cotton-growing is unknown in
Canada. Other consuming countries
against which Lancashire has registered
no kick show a greater disparity. In
20 years the exports to China have de-
clined from 773 millions to 52 millions,
to India and “the East” from 539 mil-
lions to 56 millions, to Egypt from 200
millions to 64 millions.
The total exports of British cotton
goods as a whole have declined in the two
decades by over 72 per cent., and the
falling-off attributable to the Australian
duties would, at the most, amount to a
fraction of 1 per cent. Webster also
reveals how one Lancastrian manufac-
turer spilled the beans:
We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that
the tariff represents the first step in
Australia’s policy of developing her own
manufactures, and therefore we feel it is
time to protest.
But the Lancastrian declaration of war
is most palpable bluff, after all. Lan-
cashire covers a very populous part
of England, but a part with a small pur-
chasing power. The amount of our farm
produce which Lancashire consumes is
only a fraction of the exports which Eng-
land takes, and will continue to take.
On the other hand, the Australian public
is Lancashire’s second-largest customer.

Unemployment in N. S. Wales.
Mr. Dunningham, N.S.W. Minister for
Labor, thinks it speaks volumes for his
Unemployment Council that “it main-
tains relations with the public without
friction, considering that during its term
the council has allocated £17,000,000.”
Says Mr. Dunningham modestly:
As a result of the efforts of the council,
the number of unemployed in this State,
including those on food relief, was at the
end of June 24,000. This means that about
176,000 have been provided with some
form of employment, and, whilst many are
engaged in rationed employment only,
there is every prospect that with, the con-
tinued policy of the council more employ-
ment will become available during the
next 12 months.
There are about 2,000,000 employees
in Australia—l,6oo,ooo over 20 ; 400,000
under 20. The last report of the Com-
monwealth Statistician shows that unem-
ployment among 422,000 unionists in-
cluded in these equalled 20.9 p.c. of the
total, or 88,413. The N. S. Wales rate was
24.5 p.c.—only S.A. (25.4 p.c.) showed
a higher one. In addition, there are un-
employed, thousands of them, who do
not belong to any union. So Mr. Dun-
ningham’s 24,000 looks like a drop in the
bucket, and his admiration for his work
and that of his colleagues is to be dis-
counted.
And the State with the second-high-
est general unemployment rate has the
highest in some trades. In engineering,
the Victorian figures are 4.5 p.c. better ;
in clothing, hats and boots, Victoria has
10 p.c. out, Queensland 7.2 p.c. and N. S.
Wales 22.1 p.c. In mining and quarry-
ing, the unemployment is: N. S. Wales
32.2 p.c., Victoria 14.6 p.c. and Queens-
land 21 p.c. As for land transport
workers 28.8 p.c. are on the dole or near
it in N. S. Wales against 15.8 p.c. in Vic-
toria and 6.1 p.c. in Queensland.
In 1933-34 there were “approximately
80,000 [N.S.W.] men employed on relief
works, as compared with 40,000 at the
end of the previous financial year.”
Really, it is not a thing to be proud of
after nearly five years of depression,
though it may be made to sound well
during the election campaign for which
Mr. Dunningham’s Government is pre-
paring.

Melbourne’s Dwindling Parks.
W. A. Watt, former Federal Treasurer,
former Vic. Premier and latter-day busi-
nessman, addressing Melbourne’s motor-
ists, advocated the abolition of parking in
the central city streets and the creation of
parking areas. Watt’s idea is an excel-
lent one, but' it is doubtful if he con-
sidered what would be likely to happen.
If the authorities were to decide on
such a course, the first thing would be
to slice a piece off a convenient park
and declare it a parking area. Treasury
Gardens and Flagstaff Gardens and the
most picturesque piece of the Alexandra
Gardens would be invaded by a crowd
of sustenance workers, the trees would
be felled, the flower beds levelled down
and rows of posts imbedded to mark the
spaces for the reception of individual
cars. There are no open spaces close to
Melbourne except parks, and parks are
invariably the ordained victims of the
civic “improver,” especially in times of
financial stringency.
It is only a few years since the Vic.
Railways Department cut a huge slice
off Richmond Park for it's electrical dis-
tributing centre; while, within the past
few weeks, another slice has gone west
for a military depot, though it must be
admitted that the old site was restored
in exchange. Behind the Melbourne
Cricket Ground a giggle-city-“Joyland”
has arisen. A temporary alienation, but
experience teaches those who wish to
preserve the parks to view temporary
alienations with suspicion.
Meanwhile, the people controlling
cricket grounds about Melbourne are
agitating to carry out their fences a few
feet further into the public reserves.
Many of them have a good case—from
their side. They are unable to accom-
modate the football crowds in comfort,
and better accommodation would mean
bigger gates and more entertainment for
the public. A way out would be to make
a fifty-fifty bargain with the clubs and
grant them the desired space, condition-
ally on their granting a similar area in
leasonable proximity to the ground.
Such a scheme would, in fact, be more
effective than at present, for park areas
should be spread.
London possesses one of the largest
park proportions in the world, yet its
parks are so large as to be useless to mil-
lions of Londoners. Melbourne is liable
to similar criticism. Royal Park is an
area so enormous that to walk to the
middle of it is like going into the coun-
try. Collingwood, Richmond and other
suburbs have to scratch along with a
scrap of park land. A hundred children’s
playgrounds each a little larger than a
couple of suburban blocks would be of
more real value than twice the aggregate
area in one lump.

Melrose of Adelaide.
“El V.”: C. J. Melrose, of Adelaide,
21 years old, is doing something which
makes one proud of Australian youth.
In August, after a mere few hours of
experience, he flew 8000 miles round
Australia in 5| days. In the latter half of
September he pottered off from Darwin
in a tiny Puss Moth, knowing nothing of
the route. Eight days and nine hours
afterwards he dropped to the ground at
Croydon, having cut James Mollison’s
record by 15 hours. And Mollison
is an experienced mail pilot and was the
first man to fly the Atlantic from Eng-
land, beside having some other feats to
his credit which place him among the
first half-dozen birdmen of the world.
Melrose entered for the air-race handi-
cap, after having reorganised his machine.
He was the only lone flier in the
handicap. He was pitted against men like
MacGregor and Walker, who, since they
could give each other a rest, could fly
17 hours a day to his 10 or 11, and who
had the swiftest light machine of its type
—it made the fastest time in the King’s
Cup, Britain’s classic air race, starting
from scratch: 147.8 m.p.h. They were
giving him only shr. 36min. concession.
Against him, also, was the big Douglas
—so big that its passengers can take a
20-yard stroll in the cabin, so powerful
that it could fly above any storm in
ordinary circumstances with the Melrose
’plane swung under a wing as a dinghy.
Melrose had to start last, watching
world-famous drivers like Stack, Scott,
Parer and the Mollisons soar off ahead
of him. But he made the perfect flight to
Singapore, never allowing himself to be
pushed, never losing his head. His aver-
age to Darwin was about 116 m.p.h.
(actual flying time, 94 hours), and when
blown off his course he showed the cool-
ness of an old hand. Great light-’plane
flights London-Darwin have been made
by men whose names are household
words ; this lad has beaten them all.
Melrose is unlucky that he was not
born four years before. He would have
been adjudged, in 1930, the greatest flying
man in the world, and when he gets into
bigger ’planes he may be, anyhow. His
is a useful flight—the fine test of a level-
headed young man and of the everyday
reliability of a light machine, the price
of which is no more than that of a
reasonably expensive touring-car.

The Seventeen-million City.
In the 21st year from its foundation,
Canberra has been put upon the map ;
and what a map! It is an ethereal crea-
tion which gives the impression that Aus-
tralia’s Rome was conceived by ghosts
rather than human’wolf-cubs. It is prob-
ably the only plan of a capital city in
the world in which whole suburbs are
shown as dotted lines and in which vast
avenues dedicated to the King and the
Constitution end in nothingness. How-
ever, what there is of the city is well
marked. Every house has a red spot
to itself. The pubs are plotted ; they
and their very bedroom blocks (laid out
in self-contained suites, like a rajah’s
guest-house seraglio) and garages.
There are a few omissions. Since the
vast suburb of Deakin contains nothing
but the Prime Minister’s lodge in one
corner, plus two vague cottages and a
girls’ school, it might have been a fair
thing to put in Mr. Lyons’s dog kennel
or even to show the Lyons dog hunting
the rabbits. And it is surely bad adver-
tising to exhibit “Capital Hill” (which
would have sounded more Roman as
“Capitol”) as a vast, empty, vague circle
like the track of a newchum walking
from Boulia to Carandotta. There is a
foundation-stone on Capital Hill which
would have lent variety to an otherwise
monotonous chart, especially if they had
drawn the black snake which lives under
it asleep on top.
So far Canberra has cost something
like 17 millions ; but what’s 17 millions?

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“G.M.”: As a spectacular affair, the
Duke’s progress through Melbourne, with
a few soldiers marching before and be-
hind, would have suffered by compari-
son with the Druids’ celebration at Tun-
gamah or the annual display of the
Tibooburra Fire Brigade. The finest
procession I have ever seen was the dis-
play of the Melbourne Chinese when the
present King came to open Com-
monwealth Parliament. For sheer beauty
of costume and perfection of design the
Orientals left the Caucasians nowhere.
The dragon itself, 100 yards of brilliant
silk and gold brocade, was worth travel-
ling miles to see. Second to this I place
the latter half of the procession when
Sydney Bridge was opened. The first
few floats, supposed to be historical, were
nothing much, but the decorative ones —
especially those from the beachside
suburbs —were things of exquisite beauty,
with the artistically-designed groups of
well-developed boys and girls resting like
tinted statuary in a mass of floral splen-
dor. But I doubt if Melbourne would
stand that amount of nudity, however
beautiful. The world’s worst procession
is London’s Lord Mayor’s show, albeit
spoken of with bated breath. I witnessed
the gruesome spectacle in 1921 ; it con-
sisted of half a dozen frowsy cars, a
handful of soldiers and a few banners.
The Boy Scouts are better every Satur-
day.
“W.P.T.”: As far back as 1918 shire
councils had “indecent” problems to deal
with, and they weren’t all beach coun-
cils, either. On the Forbes-road, near
Eugowra (N.S.W.), there was a natural
rock-formation known as “Mary’s Rock.”
It was said to be an exact representation
of a nude female —-“improper,” indeed,
an inspector told the Boree Shire Coun-
cil. He said he had had many complaints
about it, and suggested that it should
be destroyed with a charge of dynamite.
The council, however, refused to inter-
fere. I’m wondering if it is still there
to-day or whether some morally-minded
people have put a neck-to-knee bathing-
costume on it.
“Conkling”: Melbourne’s centenary cele-
brations seem to have brought all the
abos. in Vic. out of their mia-mias. At
normal times, a Melburnian doesn’t see
an abo. once a year. Now you may
run across them three or four times a
day ; and, seeing that there are only a
score or so full-bloods in the whole
State, their concentration appears to have
been fairly effective. The couple of
abos. who took part in the Wild Aus-
tralia stampede were objects of great
interest to the Red Indians who came
.vith the cowboy outfit. The Redmen in
private life are all perfect ladies and
gentlemen, graduates of universities, etc.,
who know nothing of their own lan-
guage but talk good American.
“Schnorrer”: The completion of the
620 miles pipe-line to the port of Haifa,
to run oil from the Iraq fields, gives
Palestine a new importance from the
British standpoint. The pipe-line, which
cost nearly as much as the Sydney
Harbor Bridge, cuts out the Suez Canal
charges on tankers with freights for
European ports, besides much lighterage
and a lengthy land journey. Haifa be-
comes a considerable port; it already
handles the immensely valuable Dead
Sea potash deposits and much of the
orange business. Since the war a re-
markable change has come over that
little strip of land which has loomed so
largely in human history, but for hun-
dreds of years lived almost entirely on
its holy places. The Mandate looks
likely to become as valuable to Britain
commercially as strategically.
“Jim G.”: Leeton, which is about the
youngest town in N.S.W., until recently
followed one of England’s oldest cus-
toms by employing a nightwatchman
who shouted out the midnight hour,
“Twelve o’clock, and all’s well! God
bless the King!” He was an old sailor, and
claimed to be a Cutty Sark man, but if
all those who have made that claim to
me were genuine the old windjammer
must have carried a crew of some thou-
sands.

“Findy”: I find I was wrong in credit-
ing “Pat’s Penny Paper” (Adelaide) with
being the smallest in the Commonwealth
(B. 17/10/’34). The “Torres Straits
Daily Pilot” is published at Thursday
“Any more pretty girls like you round
here?”
“You boys haven’t given me time to
find out.”

to strangers) and is a single sheet 12in.
by 9in. printed on one side only. My
copy contains shipping news, telegrams
from Brisbane and Canberra, cables
from London and three advertisements.
These last' draw attention to a church
service, a fancy-dress ball and the vir-
tues of gin.
“D.”: Canon Alexander, of St. Paul’s
Cathedral, London, wrote to the “Times”
last month mentioning that “the
preacher’s words, spoken into a small
microphone in the pulpit, are now dis-
tinctly heard through the medium of
four loudspeakers.” Wren would have
approved of the innovation. He regarded
acoustics as of prime importance, and
his City churches, as well as St. Paul’s,
were designed to enable as many wor-
shippers as possible to hear the preacher’s
voice ; but he complained that the enun-
ciation of British clergymen was bad.
Unlike French and Italians the British
preachers of his day were guilty of “the
insufferable Fault of dropping the voice
at the last words.” They do it still. Seven
years ago I sometimes found it hard to
follow Dean Inge at 20 feet with an
acousticon. An interesting effect of the
introduction of loudspeakers to cathedrals
should be to revivify the fast-dying art
of pulpiteering. England has many
great Anglican preachers, and they would
all like to be heard in St. Paul’s and the
Abbey at times. But what’s the good of
holding forth for the benefit of a hun-
dred or so? An effective system of loud-
speakers might enable the possessor of
a fine voice and clear articulation like
Bishop Barnes to be heard by 5000.
When the first royal visit to
Australia occurred —that of the Duke of
Edinburgh in 1868 —the “Argus” of the
day treated the celebration with befitting
respect, and in describing the then-new
Melb. Public Library’s entrance said,
“Cressets of flame adorned the portals
of the edifice.” The “Age,” fiercely radi-
cal, dismissed the same decorations with
the remark: “On the gateposts were
stuck two burning pots of fat.”

“Clox”: A jeweller friend told me this
in an expansive moment: “A woman
came in this morning and gave me her
watch to look at. ‘lt needs cleaning,’ I
told her professionally. She angrily in-
sinuated that, as I had had it twice for
that purpose in the last six months, this
‘cleaning’ must be a put-up job. So I
had to tell her why it required cleaning
so often. Nine women in ten take their
wristlets off and leave them on their
dressing-tables while they dust powder
over themselves. Where small diamonds
are inset there is generous entrance for
powder. You’d be astonished,” he con-
cluded, “how many watches are stopped
and brought into me every week with
their innards well powdered.”

“Ilford”: Martha Rendall was the last
woman executed in Australia (B.
24/10/’34); judging from some recent
verdicts, she will be the last for a long
time. I think that Edith Thompson was
the last who went to the gallows in Eng-
land, about 11 years ago. Hers, unlike
Martha’s, was a crime passionel, which
might have sav,ed her with a French jury.
None the less, it was just as horribly
deliberate. She sought to kill her hus-
band by administering powdered glass to
him in judicious doses ; that having failed
or proving too slow a process, she stood
by while her affinity stabbed her lawful
consort to death. Yet, even then, the
idea of hanging a woman was becoming
abhorrent, however black her guilt, and
Edith might have escaped the death sen-
tence had it been possible to commute
it without doing the same for her part-
ner's, who had set his own case beyond
all hope of mercy by chivalrously taking
all the blame for the murder. The woman
had to be carried to the hangman ; the
man died bravely enough, after cheer-
fully discussing with his warders the
chances of the teams which were left in
for the Association Cup.
“Taws”: The U.S.A. marble players (B.
3/10/’34) aren’t the only ones. Recently
Mundingburra school (N.Q.) celebrated
its jubilee. The first head teacher was
there, and a dozen or more of the
original scholars. One of the latter, Philp,
brought along some of his ancient stock
of school marbles. “We’re in this,” said
Willmett, Gulliver, Hopkins and Walker,
and they had a game of big ring. All of
them are businessmen, and I’m willing to
bet the winner of that U.S.A. event didn’t
get any more kick out of it than those
old boys did as they “faincd dubs” and
“knuckled down” to each other on the
ground where they used to play for
“keeps.”

“A.H.S.”: “Darlinghearsed” takes a
pessimistic view of the advance of radio
(B. 10/10/’34). A neighboring lady of
nervous disposition tells me that it has
dissipated all her old dread of being left
alone at night. Her husband, she ex-
plained, had to do long stretches of over-
time ; “now, as soon as he goes out at
night, I tune in to a talk and tone the
volume down to the level of ordinary
conversation. Occasionally I make a
remark, so that if anyone is about with
an idea of breaking into the house he
will hear two voices and think better
of it.”

“Louden”: Twenty-five years ago I
watched a signwriter putting the pro-
prietor’s name on the first Chinese laun-
dry in our suburb. The name is there
still, and the business goes on under it,
though numerous heads have come and
gone. The other day I asked the latest
arrival his name. “Allee same on winder,”
he told me. I am wondering if anyone
has noticed a change of name on a
Chow’s laundry.
“Mel”: Regarding the controversy
about our earliest bird-men (B. 17/10/’34)
Delfosse Badgery, now of the N.S.W.
Parliamentary staff, constructed a biplane
at his home at Moss Vale in 1910, and
used to fly it to Goulburn. No
one had ever seen an aeroplane in
those parts before, and Badgery’s
bandbox was an object of wonder
until the Frenchman Guilleaux came
as a bolt from the blue and took
some of the glory off the local make.
When Bill Hart was at his top Delfosse
crossed to Tasmania to try commercial
flying, but the venture was unsuccessful.
He became a squadron-leader at the
war, serving in Palestine with the A.F.A.;
since then he has gained another distinc-
tion in being the only officer of the
N.S.W. Parliament who has been con-
nected with every branch of the estab-
lishment except “Hansard.”

“Regency”: Sydney “Telegraph,” in
its first rhapsody over the ducal landing
in Melbourne, dwelt on the magnificence
of our royal visitor’s “black, red and gold
attire.” Next day, when wearing the
same kit, H.R.H. was ticked off as wear-
ing “black, silver and gold.” Like all
British Hussar regiments, the uniform of
the 10th is blue, with heavy gold facings.
There is no red in it, though the busby
bag is crimson. If this goes on, the
Duke’s uniform, by the time he gets to
Brisbane, will have more colors than
Jardine’s kaleidoscopic cap.
“Friction Tube”: It is understandable
that Australian newspaper scribes should
make bloomers over unfamiliar uniforms,
but they might be expected to have some
knowledge of a force which has been
Australia’s leading military unit since the
C.M.F. supplanted those of the States.
When the Duke arrived at Canberra a
force described as the “Royal Grenadiers
Artillery” fired a salute, one of the re-
sults being the death of a golf-ball-
thieving magpie. The narrator asserts
that the mag. was so fascinated by
the gunner’s “red tunic” that it didn t
leave its nest and was killed instanter by
the concussion. This is the first time l
ever heard of grenadier artillerymen.
The old Scots Greys in the days before
Marlborough’s wars were known as
the Horse Grenadiers, and were equipped
accordingly. Gunners wearing red tunics
instead of the traditional dark blue are
another innovation. PS. —“R.G.A.
stands for “Royal Garrison Artillery.
You can see a mob of them at Sydney
Victoria Barracks any day.
TO THE FALLEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Laurel their wreath, and glowing praise their
due.
Who winged their way from shore to utmost
shore,
Who wrote their names across the trackless
But ere the glamor fades, the shouting dies,
Is there no calling for a wreath of rue
(Rue for remembrance) of the gallant two
Whose flying hours are o’er?
Triumph unstinted here for lords of air.
Intrepid conquerors of space. For them,
Crushed bodies by the ruthless Apenninc,
Dim candles guttering in a village shrine.
No torrent of acclaim, no limelit Hare,
Nor any accolade to greet them there,
Only a requiem.
Honor to each and all whose names are sent
Around the world for many a day to ring!
The place of pride is theirs, the pride of place
That ever waits the swiftest in the race.
Yet spare a thought for those whose eyes were
bent
Upon the goal; who failed, but failed intent,
Who died unfaltering.
Sleep well, ye twain whose earthly race was
run
Before the loud-reverberating roar
Arose to meet and greet the victors’ ’planes!
A silent toast for Gilman and for Baines,
Whose strife with elements is over and done,
“For whom all winds are quiet as the sun,
All waters as the shore.”

“M.G.”.‘ A boatload of Port Mel-
bourne watersiders rowed out to the
Italian warship the other day and asked
“Anybody understand English?” “Yes,
me do,” replied one of the visitors.’
“ Then,” cried the Aussie, “catch this
blanky rope.” Later, when the sailor had
apparently spread the story round the
ship, another Italian called as the boat
was leaving. “Any you onnerstan ze

blanky right we do,” he retorted.
“Adel.”: The odd case of a Burnt Baby
has been occupying the Courts in S.A.
I hat State, like Westralia, has a Mt.
Barker, and at the hospital there a new-
born child was placed near a wood fire.
A spark flew out into the cot, and
the mite lost a finger. The hospital
i rankly admitted liability, but thought
the £lOOO claimed for the child was too
much, and the £250 for “shock and
agony of mind” of the mother too
“remote.” The Court thought so, too,
and gave the infant £250 (which should
double itself by the time she grows up)
and the mother £25 for expenses.

“Fitzwilliam”: “Night Rounds” (B.
24/JO/’34) is wrong when he cites a
recent Melbourne case as the first in
which a verdict of “murder by fear” has
been returned in Australia. In 1894, at
Bathurst, two young men were found
guilty of “murder by intimidation,” and,
as was the wholesome practice in those
days, were hanged. The victim was
a Chinaman. He and the accused were
travelling in the same compartment of
a train ; the case for the Crown was that,
alter having suffered some outrageous
ill-treatment from his fellow-passengers,
Ah Choy was so terrified that he jumped
lrom the window of the train and was
killed. The Judge told the jury that, if
"The play opens with the brigand chief, a magnificent specimen of manhood
passionately embracing the fragile girl as he bids her farewell.”
they were satisfied the Chinaman leaped
to his death under apprehension of
further violence, the prisoners were just
as responsible as if they had taken him
in their hands and thrown him out.

“Cinna”: Among the odes and paeans
of greeting to the Duke of Gloucester I
find no allusion to his regiment, the 10th
Hussars, though none of his other distinc-
tions furnishes so telling a rhyme-ending.
Fifty years ago London “Punch” pub-
lished some verses about an episode in
the regiment’s history wherein the writer,
supposed to be Clement Scott, made
great play with the two words. The
scene depicted: was in Egypt, where
Baker Pasha, once Colonel of the Tenth,
but disgraced, turned out of the Army
and ostracised from society, watched his
old regiment ride past him. The writer
finished his composition with a special
plea to Queen Victoria to let the dead
past be buried and restore a very gallant
officer to his old job. Sad doggerel 1
suppose it was:
Give back, with his wounds and scars,
The man who has sinned and suffered and is
loved by the Tenth Hussars.
Anyway it was unavailing. Baker Pasha,
though he had done distinguished service
in the field for another nation, never
became Colonel Valentine Baker again.

“Selma”: The “moron press” (B.
24/10/’34) is not alone in the disapproval
of silk hats. I once heard a Maoriland
M.P. heckled for suggesting that all
was not well with the Dominion.
“If y e f don’t like the country,” yelled
an interjector, “why don’t yer go
back t’England, where yer come from?”
“Well,” answered the M.P. mildly,
“I’ll tell you one of my reasons. From
the time I was twelve years old 1 was
made to wear a silk hat. I decided that
some day I would live in a place where
hats did not matter. I’m living in it now.”
The rest of the speech passed off without
serious interruption.

“R.A.W.”: “Con Tango’s” pleasure at
being furnished with a book of diminu-
tive cheque-forms (B. 10/10/’34) was
probably not shared by the man who
handed it to him. The diversity of
size and make-up of cheque forms nowa-
days is hard on those who have to handle
and sort hundreds of them at a sitting.
The tiny slip of five inches or less be-
comes a nuisance when bunched in with
the large ornate orders of a lordly public
company. Again, bank officials are apt
to swear when their usual quick glance
at the bottom left-hand corner for the
amount of a cheque merely dis-
closes the name of the bank. Many
cheques now are a full history of
the transaction, complete with amount
of discount and a request to sign
a receipt on the back ; but so long as
they are an unconditional order in writ-
ing addressed to a banker, payable on
demand, they can take what form they
like. An adequately-worded order on a
plain piece of paper, signed and duly-
stamped, would be honored. But some
uniformity of size and layout would be
a big aid in the business of banks and
counting-houses.

“Dungeness”: Long ago a mys-
terious lady passenger on one of
the liners from North Asia had at-
tracted a good deal of attention
on board by veiled hints as to the
profits to be made at opium-smuggling.
The Customs people at Cairns were
tipped off, and a watching sleuth
at the gangway heard the lady clank —
skirts were worn much fuller in those
days. She was stopped, questioned, and
finally arrested, protesting volubly and
threatening both police and Customs with
the direst penalties. An interested crowd
“Me wear beach pyjamas ! If a girl's got a good figger, why ’ide it?”
followed the indignant prisoner to the
police station, where some hours were
occupied in wiring to Brisbane to have
the sergeant’s wife appointed a female
searcher. When the lady was searched
16 small tins were found in her clothing.
They contained a dark, viscid substance,
pronounced by an analyst to be treacle.
This was confirmed by the suspect, who
added that she always carried it as a
preventive of rheumatism. Two bothered
Governments managed to square the
claims for illegal detention, loss of pas-
sage, and so on. It wasn’t till later that
the full story leaked out. A dinghy load
of the real stuff had been landed under
the wharf by the lady’s confederates while
all the fuss was going on, and every
opium smoker from Cairns to Chillagoe
was fully supplied for months.
“Thargo”: J don't know whether
Percy Brunton would have made a suc-
cessful Parliamentarian (B. 10/10/’34),
but a speech I once heard him make on
the Perth Esplanade was thoroughly
candid on the subject. “Ladies and
gentlemen,” he said, “if you put me into
Parliament I’ll feather me own nest the
first year; I’ll feather me own nest the
second year; and the third year I’ll see
what I can do for the people. And just
you remember that I’m telling you the
truth ; others make a lot of soft-soap
promises, and tell you a lot of lies.”

The Sydney youth who con-
fessed to the Melbourne police that he
had committed a murder at
Waverley (N.S.W.), and sub-
sequently admitted that he had
sought to fasten the brand of
Cain on himself-merely to get
a free trip home, was not origi-
nal. Years ago, when the man-
hunt for the Gatton (Q.) triple
murderer was hot, a Mel-
bourne crook, desirous of try-
ing his skill in Queensland,
walked into the detective
office and declared that he
had done the deed. Unfor-
tunately for his scheme, he
happened to have been in Mel-
bourne Gaol at the very time
the murders were committed.
It was such a convincing alibi
that, instead of obtaining a
free trip to Brisbane, he
found himself compelled to
stay in Melbourne for another three
months.
“Kwakprak”: Quite often we have to
salve the wounded pride of would-be
blood donors at our hospital by explain-
of these groups, and they never change
from birth. Two of them are found
very rarely amongst American Indians,
less rarely amongst the British, and in
steadily increasing proportion across
Europe towards Africa and India. The
proportions are the same for European
Jews as for Arabs, for pure-blooded
gipsies as for natives of India. Curi-
ously, the only colored race whose blood-
groups are identical in proportion with
the European races is the Japanese.
The Ainu, the aboriginal race of Japan,
has almost identical blood-groupings
with Norwegians. Animals, from the
tailed apes down, do not lit into human
blood-groups ; but the orang, gorilla and
other higher apes all belong to them,
and have no others.
“Rokko”: The lasting impression of
fear! An elderly woman acquaintance
asked me to go with her into the baker’s
shop. “I never go into any shop alone”
she explained afterwards, and fold me
the reason. When a child of twelve,
living in a small country town, she
had been sent to the butcher’s. The
butcher, cheerfully sharpening his knife,
asked “Did anybody see you come in?”
“No, I don’t think so,” said the unsus-
pecting child. “Well, nobody will see
you go out,” said the man of meat, and
made a dash round the block. Dodging
the upraised knife she screamed lustily.
Passers-by heard her and rushed in, and
the butcher, a fighting maniac, was
secured. The unfortunate man, until
then apparently normal, had become sud-
denly demented ; he died the next day.
But the woman, now over 60 and the
mother of a grown-up family, told me
that she had never since gone into any
shop alone.

“L.H.”: As to the way Cotter the
cricketer came to his death (B.
24/10/’34), writer heard of it as the
Ist L.H. Brigade rode into Beersheba
after a long flanking movement. As we
were lining up at the watering-troughs
in the darkness someone said “Heard
the news?” “Have they carried Gaza
yet?” “Gaza be damned!” was the
reply ; “Tib Cotter’s killed.” His version
was that Cotter, a Number 3, was shot
down by a surrendered Turk while taking
over his section horses at the edge of the
trenches. “Sherlock’s” story of a shell
which nearly got him reads thinly, for
after the charge had reached the trenches
the Turks, with the Ist Brigade coming
in behind them with the bayonet, were
getting their guns out at desperate speed.
Gullett’s history of the campaign gives
the horseholder story as the correct one.
ing that, however excellent the quality of
what they are offering, it is not the right
kind for the patient. The test is very
easy. You need only to mix a drop of
the offered gore with a drop of the
patient’s serum; if they don’t suit, the
corpuscles, seen under the microscope or
even a good magnifying glass, first stick
together and then break up. Blood which

MILKY PORRIDGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
' “The latest fashionable color in women’s wear is
known as stone beig-e or milky porridge.”
She makes a picture good to print,
She knocks you through and through
In clothes of almost any tint
Or tinge or shade or hue.
But, though the spectrum’s bounds you beat
And for new pigments forage,
She never seems to me so sweet
As when attired in porridge.
She looks
Her best in milky porridge.
Some call it beige—l find the same
(As Weller, S., averred
Of chalybeate) a very tame
And inexpressive word.
It conjures nothing to the view
That’s half as soft and silky
(And appetising) as burgoo
When reasonably milky.
For me
It can’t be over-milky.
In angel-skin she’s stylish, true;
She brightens up the scene
No end in Riviera blue;
She’s chic in lizard-green.
But, whatsoe’er her mode or mood,
She s worth a poet’s hymnings.
I’ll always say, in breakfast food
With lots of lacteal trimmings.
Too right!
In mush with lacteal trimmings.
Range all the color gamut through
And borrow what you wish
from beast or bird, from broth or brew,
From flower, fruit or fish;
from glitt’ring gems to golden grain,
Boron 1a to borage;
And, still unshaken, I’ll maintain
She looks her best in porridge.
My oath!
She s sweet in milky porridge.

POLITICAL POINTS
Wonderful is the loyalty of Conserva-
tive newspapers to their new leader,
who was a Labor politician for 22 years.
Witness their report that the U.A.P.
members, arrived at Canberra for the
opening of the new Parliament, con-
veyed their admiration for and unswerv-
ing devotion to him “unanimously and
with applause.” They forgot to men-
tion the absence of S.A. members who
are critical of Joseph’s handling of the
negotiations with Page, and they said
nothing about Perkins. Two days later
Perkins himself announced that as the
U.A.P. was apparently becoming a city
party he might have to join the C.P.
There is such a thing as having too good
a “press.”
An empty compliment,, put in the
G.-G.’s mouth:
My Government wishes to express to
all primary producers the indebtedness of
the nation for the manner in which they
have, despite low price-levels, continued to
maintain and, in many industries, sub-
stantially increase the measure of their
production and export.
As a sign of its gratitude it dismissed
the only Minister from a country elec-
torate, meeting Parliament with a city
and suburban team.
A Sydney bookmaker with political
ambitions is listed by the Commonwealth
Commissioner of Taxation as having
“omitted” income amounting to £16,214
during the five years to June 30, 1933.
Penalty, £269. Part of the time the
gentleman was one of the Lang Govern-
ment’s agents for collecting it's 10 p.c.
tax on successful punters —still regarded
as a prime jest by the boys.
Adelaide is to have a milk-control
scheme like the one in Sydney. Adelaide
has Sydney’s sympathy.
Douglas ’planes, the suitability of
which to Australian conditions has been
so strikingly demonstrated, are to be
built in Holland under license. Australia
breeds great flying men, and increasingly
needs fast mail and passenger services.
Why shouldn’t Douglas ’planes be built
in Australia under license?
Dunningham, the N.S.W. Minister of
Labor, started a “Brighten-up Campaign”
a while ago, and, by way of helping,
Hartigan, the Commissioner of Railways,
had a lot of engines painted green. It
has involved him in far graver trouble
than the granting of salary-increases
which come out of the public purse. The
L.O.L. won’t be satisfied until at least
60 p.c. of the green engines are painted
orange.
N.S.W. . seaside councils are greatly
exercised in their minds as to how much
of Cissy should be exposed on their
beaches. Manly has the right idea. When
its beach inspector asked for instructions
it referred the matter to the finance
committee.
South Aus. is beginning to prepare for
its own centenary. The Government is
adding £150,000 of loan money to the
Bonython gift of £lOO,OOO so that Par-
liament House may be finished, accord-
ing to the original plan, in 1936, and a
new foreshore road is talked of, also a
showground hall. There is no chance of
celebrating the 100th year by reaching
100 millions of debt; the hundred-mil-
lion mark was passed long ago. The
State owes £107,000,000 —nearly £lB2
per head.
Westralian Labor budgeted for a
deficit of £644,400. Considering what
it is getting from Canberra and how the
premium and exchange are piling up tax-
able gold-mining and company-promo-
tion profits, this year’s accounts could
be balanced, as Opposition-leader
Latham protests. But, of course, it is
easier to have a deficit and blame Lyons
and co. for it.
It is estimated that Melbourne’s Tram-
ways Board lost £30,000 in revenue dur-
ing the strike, which lasted four days,
and the men lost between £lO,OOO and
£ll,OOO in wages. They are to get a
“centenary” bonus of £BOOO. They could
have had £6OOO without a strike and
without provoking the public and raising
up thousands of enemies to the nerve-

Suggested use for Melbourne’s “lollypop” decorations when the centenary
celebrations are over.
shattering means of transport they
operate. There has never been a more
irrational work-stoppage —the obsoles-
cent resorting to the obsolete.
While it would be unthinkable to let
a foreign air-mail service compete with
a subsidised British-Australian one, the
G.P.O. might have made an exception
about the letters carried by the Dutch-
men in their Douglas. They were allowed
to bring them into Australia, but may not
take them out, though every envelope
would help to advertise Australia abroad.
Like the Taxation Department, the
G.P.O. never misses a chance to show
that it is a ruthless dictatorship.
For nine months of the present year,
Great Boulder (capital £233,333) made
mine profits reckoned at £78,000. Next
week the London board was to have
asked shareholders to increase its limit
of fees and percentage of profits from
£4500 to £12,750: fees, £2750; profit,
£lO,OOO. Perth “Sunday Times” recalls
that “the Lake View directors raised
their maximum percentage of profit from
£2500 to £10,000.” Westralian Labor an-
ticipated the Great Boulder board with a
tax, and the proposal is not to be put.
Queensland Labor is claiming credit for
a drop in general taxation from £5 4s.
9d. per head in 1928-29 to £3 Bs. Bd. in
1933-34. The Auditor-General reveals
that the drop was really due to dimin-
ished earnings of taxpayers. The tactless
person points out that there was no relief
taxation in 1928-29 and that, with relief
tax added, the amount wrung from the
people last year was £5 9s. Bd. per head,
Last week Bruxner, the N.S.W. Minis-
ter of Transport', introduced a bill “that
would,” he said, “give the necessary
authority to proceed with the construc-
tion of the administrative buildings at
Wynyard station, Sydney.” Actually, the
“necessary authority” (or the only one
that seems to matter) was taken months
ago; the buildings are half up. The
Commissioner also took leave to hand
out large salary-increases which come out
of the public funds. Supporters of the
Parliamentary system who permit these
impertinences are playing the game of
it's enemies.
Somebody blundered at the State
dinner to the Duke of Gloucester at Can-
berra. While places at his table were
reserved for 14 Ministers (four of them
honoraries) and the Lieut.-Governor of
the smallest State, Frank Gavan Duffy,
P.C. and C.J. of the High Court, was
conducted to a side table. Presently he
was moved to the top of the side table,
but he decided to go back to his hotel.
It is asserted that the accepted order of
precedence was strictly observed; but
the decencies were not. It was no way
to treat a fine old public servant.
With the tourist season beginning, Tas-
mania is disturbed at a report from Can-
berra that the Government will “review”
its pre-election promise to give the Speck
statutory relief from the Navigation Act
because it lost three of those five seats in
the House of Reps. Hobart’s Mayor
has sent a telegram saying that the
promise was express and that' citizens
will be “amazed” if the Government
goes back on it. Australia will be
amazed also. If politics were to be run
on such principles, it would be more
straightforward to give up elections alto-
gether and put all Parliamentary seats up
to auction.
The mordant Snowden, who is writing
his reminiscences, suggests that Ramsay
MacDonald “deliberately planned the
breach with his old party” so that' he
“might retain the Premiership and asso-
ciate with colleagues with whom he had
more sympathy than ever he had with
his Labor colleagues.”
When I told Mr. MacDonald that he
would now find himself popular in strange
quarters, he replied, “Yes; to-morrow
every duchess in London will be wanting
to kiss me.”
It is highly probable. Didn’t the dear
duchesses want to kiss Billy?
Acting Railway Chief Harris told a
public body in Melbourne that the Vic.
railways in the past two years had re-
turned from 3f p.c. to 4 p.c. on capital,
which no other railway system in the
world had done. He omitted to add that
the capital consisted of loan money for
which as much as 5 p.c. was paid, so
the enterprise was run at a loss. But
that is no fault of Harris or his superior
Clapp. Victoria should give full credit
to the manner in which their work has
been done, financially and every way.
The trouble is with the politicians who
authorised the borrowing of money, not
only for construction and equipment,
but for renewals which should properly
have been paid for out of revenue.
Under the bill “amending” the measure
which permits the extortion of lOd.
in the £ from a N.S.W. citizen’s gross
income from other States, the Com-
missioner of Taxation is empowered to
determine whether or not the worm is
domiciled in N. S. Wales. This is a re-
minder that domicile is becoming as
knotty a problem in taxation as in divorce
matters. Yet if we had a Commonwealth
Government careful of the rights of the
people the question need never arise.
The Commonwealth Parliament has the
power to bring in a uniform divorce
law, and a resolute Government could
reduce the income-tax laws (and taxes)
to one. But it is scared of the churches
and of the States, so thousands of Aus-
tralians are denied justice.

G. J. Bell, the new Commonwealth
Speaker, was born in Gippsland, but has
spent most of his life (he is just on 60)
in Tasmania, where he is a grazier at
Henrietta. He has been an M.H.R. for
12 years (he was out of the 1922-25 Par-
liament), and was a soldier for almost
as long. He went to South Africa in
1899, and came back with a captaincy
and a D.S.O. ; a second-loot in the 3rd
Light Horse in August, 1914, he returned
five years later a loot-colonel and a
C.M.G., having served in Gallipoli and
Sinai with the Light Horse and in Pales-
tine with the Cameleers. Bell is highly
regarded by the Cockies, who have been
hoping he would join them, and had no
thought of running a man against him.
The new Speaker shares with Lyons a
record that may last for all time. Other
States have had only two Ms.H.R. in
the predominant party ; in no other case
has one of the two been Prime Minister
and the other Speaker.
Westralian Premier Collier has gone to
Maoriland seeking the health which has
eluded him these last few months. He
will perhaps extend his tour to the
U.S.A., and if the result is unsatisfactory
he may have to retire in favor of McCal-
lum. Collier has his critics outside Par-
liament, but hasn’t an enemy inside. A
C. W.A. SCOTT, winner, with Campbell Black, of
the speed section of the centenary air race.
big man in every way, he has nad no
rival in it as a debater since the late
Frank Wilson went down. Victorian-
born, like so many other Westralian
Laborites, he has spent half his 60 years
in the Assembly, nearly eight years as
leader.
Among the visitors to Melbourne for
the centenary is Anthony Howey. The
original Howey, a Sydney man, bought
several of the finest city blocks at
the first land sale. He wasn’t there
himself, and Sydney people who had been
there assured him that the blocks were
so heavily timbered that the cost of
clearing would be more than they were
worth. Howey, though inclined to for-
feit his deposit, decided to see the place
for himself. He and the whole of his
family were on their way south when the
vessel was lost with all hands. The land
went to his next-of-kin, distant relatives
in England, and for nearly a century
their branch of the family has been
reaping the benefit. The blocks included
the whole of the Swanston-street front-
age between Collins and Little Collins
streets and the adjoining block along Col-
lins-street, where Howey-place now
stands.
George Milne, of Adelaide, son of a
long-ago politician and Leg. Council
President, has left a fortune of £323,000.
The wine-and-spirit business carried on
by three generations of the family is to
be sold within two years.
Samuel Arnott, son of the founder of
the biscuit firm of that name, is dead in
Mosman, Sydney, at 73. He was a
friendly, cheerful person whose kindly
treatment of employees made the way of
the Communist hard. His hobbies were
horses and yachting. His trotters and his
Jerseys were among the best in the Com-
monwealth, and he was once Commodore
of the Motor Yacht Club.
Roscoe Turner would easily win the
prize for the most picturesque person in
the air race. He is a large, broad-shoul-
dered person who delights in blue shirts
and diamond-studded decorations, and
looks more like the professional lion-
tamer he was than the professional racing
flier he is. He has a large voice and
a quaint Middle-Western wit and dic-
tion which kept him out of the Flying
Corps during the war because, as a
fellow-countryman put it, “he seemed
too unpolished to kill Germans.” It
doesn’t worry him at all. He holds the
U.S.A. speed record —340 m.p.h.—and he
has flown from Cleveland to New York,
580 miles, in lhr. 44min. He also holds
the trans-American record, 2560 miles in
lOhr. And he is one of the best.
W. H. Donald has come
into the picture again as
adviser to Chiang Kai
Shek, the Chinese general-
issimo. When a junior
reporter on the old Syd-
ney “Daily Telegraph,” he
jumped at the chance of
an extra pound a week
from Melb. “A rg u s.”
While he was on the
“Argus” staff an offer
came from an English
newspaper in China, and
Donald left. He had just
made himself solid in the
Flowery Land when
“Chinese” Morrison, an-
other Australian, died and
left the job of adviser to
the Government vacant.
Donald tumbled into it,
and for a time it looked as
if he was going to suc-
ceed Morrison as un-
crowned king of China.
But the Republic came
along, and since then
Donald has not received
his former publicity,
though his influence is
still apparently something
to reckon with.
Adelaide has lost Dr. Matt Morgan,
son of an old-time Premier. He was
president of the Ornithological Society
and Adelaide Museum’s honorary expert
on all Australian bird-life. Incidentally,
he was a pioneer of the no-hat move-
ment.
From a man who ought to know:
E. B. Johnston, the C.P. Senator from West-
ralia, did refer to the party with which he is
now associated as “the Bulgarians of politics”
(B. 10/10/’34), but did not originate the ex-
pression. Towards the end of 1915 a dis-
cussion arose in the State Labor Caucus, to
which Bertie then belonged, as to how the
Country party would vote on a question then
prominent. Said Tom Chesson, M.L.A.
for Cue (called “Silent Tom” by the news-
papers), “No one knows how those Cockies
are going to vote, not even themselves. They
are the Bulgarians of politics.” Johnston used
the words in the House that afternoon. They
were thought to be rather apt. But he lived to
be sorry he had been so clever.
Squadron-leader David Stodart, who,
with a 24-year-old cousin as companion,
got his Airspeed-Courier to Darwin on
the eighth day of the
air race and refused to let
the doctor attend to a
badly-gashed right hand,
was the oldest competitor
—he is 54. He was with
the Royal Flying Corps
throughout the Great War.
With hardly a breather he
was transferred to the
North-West India side-
show in 1919, and was
mentioned in dispatches
three times. In Palestine
the following year he had
a bar added to the D.S.O.
with which he had been
decorated in Europe.
Four years later he was
in command of one of the
bombing squadrons at
Iraq, where he was sta-
tioned for three years. He
retired from the R.F.C. in
1921.
The first Australian to
judge a Crystal Palace
world band championship
will be Frank Wright, who
will have 190 bands to
deal with. Australasian
champion cornetist when
18 years old and conduc-
tor of Ballarat City Band
at 19, Wright judged the
Australian band cham-
pionships in 1932 and the
Maoriland championships
last year. When not judging, he is musi-
cal director of St. Hilda’s band, London.
“Vic” farewells a friend:
Lew Fatt, of Darwin, who at 71 has become
an ancestor, had been in the N.T. 57 years. He
came as an indentured laborer at a few shil-
lings a month, accumulated many thousands of
pounds and scattered much of it among the
poor. He was never heard to complain that
the Territory was a place unfit for human
habitation. His son last season won the
trophy for the best and fairest footballer in
Darwin under Australian Rules. The old man
had a wonderful way with animals. “Lew
Fatt’s dog” was one of the legendary charac-
ters of the Territory. Years ago he used to
take his master’s horses to grass at night,
shepherd them through the dark hours and have
them back ready for work every morning.
Wags would try to ring in prads on him, but
it never worked.
“Bufo”: One informal vote on Sep-
tember 15 cannot be blamed on the
pref. system. Asked whom he’d favored
in his Queensland electorate, my 85-
year-old friend replied: “Sure, an’ who
else wud I vote for but young Casey?
Didn’t I work for his father on Kilfera
in the ’sivinties? A grand foine man
was R. G. Casey, an’ him capturin’
them Hatfield gang o’ bushrangers all
alone by himself wid only a slip of a
nayger boy wid him. Iwer since I heard
young Casey was in politics I give him
me vote, an’ no other mahn’ll get it
while R. G. Casey’s son needs it.” “But,
Tim,” I suggested, “he wasn’t standing
for this district.” “To hell where he
shtands!” yelled the old chap. “Wherever
he shtands my vote shtands wid him.
‘Young Casey, an’ good luck to the son
of his father,’ I wrote across the papers,
an’ they can’t make no mistake about
that!”
Melb. Alderman Frank Stapley, archi-
tect and town-planning expert, has been
found out: for eight years he has been
a baronet, and a baronet whose title
dates back to 1660! A rather shy and
unostentatious man, Frank contrived to
keep his awful secret until last week.
Even now he has no intention of flaunt-
ing the baronetcy, preferring to be known
as Mr. Stapley or, preferably, Alderman
Stapley, for he is genuinely proud of
the title he won by his own efforts. It
is a weird satire on snobbery that, while
fellow-aldermen and councillors have
been engaged in an avid scrap for a
title and courting the favor of anybody
who can lend half a foot-pound to the
A. G. WALES, Lord Mayor-elect of Melbourne.
push, Stapley has been sitting back calm
and unmoved with a bigger handle than
any of them can aspire to.

Coincident with the inauguration of the immense industrial exhibition
in Melbourne, Australian Glass Manufacturers Co., Ltd., announces
the purchase of the exclusive Australian and New Zealand rights of
certain patented glass fabricating machinery, glass melting, gas
furnaces and improved packing devices.',
This important purchase was effected by the Managing Director
during his recent visit to England for the Company which is investi-
gating current advancements in glass making in Great Britain, Europe
and America. Typical of a well-defined policy to produce, within
Australia and New Zealand, glass products equal to the best in the
world, it will enable the Company to keep its plant and methods
abreast of the most advanced practice in operation Overseas. To
further this object the services of a number of prominent overseas
artisans and expert glass workers have been secured, and they are
at p; sent en route to Australia. The Company, moreover, supplies
the entire glass requirements of the Commonwealth.

subsidiaries have been established, namely, Crown Crystal Glass Co., Ltd., and
Australian Window Glass Pty., Ltd., which, combined with the parent Company,
supplies the entire glass requirements of the Commonwealth.

Much of the co.’s success has been due
to the energy and foresight of its man-
aging director, E. T. Fisk. Besides pion-
eering wireless communication here, he
has thus far succeeded in keeping the
business under Australian control, and,
on the technical side, pointed the way
to many advances. During the last
term satisfactory agreement was reached
with Imperial Communications, Ltd.,
which, since the Empire wireless and
cables conference of 1928, has controlled
the other ends of the co.’s Beam Service
(in England and Canada), as well as the
Pacific and Eastern cables.
Including an unspecified amount pre-
viously set aside for contingencies,
but not now required, gross earnings
(£562,401) sprang £86,387. The Beam
continued to carry “satisfactorily large
volumes of traffic.” Radio receivers and
wireless valves were turned out and sold
in record quantities, three new broadcast-
ing stations were erected in Maoriland,
the wireless telephone section (it has put
Australia within speaking distance of
the rest of the world) has turned the
corner, ships in England and elsewhere
continue to be fitted with the co.’s Aus-
tralian-made equipment, and special
direction-finding instruments were made
for competitors in the big air race. The
net result, which benefited by £55,762
of the increase, was the best yet,
being 18.5 p.c. on capital as against
11, 10.3, 7.9, 11.3, 10.6 and 6.4 p.c. back
to 1928. That was after adding £33,151
net (£2457 less than in the previous term)
to the reserve against patents, etc.
(£288,259). Intangibles, not treated as
assets herein, total £142,067, of which
£49,067 represents capitalised expendi-
ture in connection with the Beam sec-
tion. The div. was lifted a couple of
points, making it 10 p.c.
The agreements with the Common-
wealth and Maoriland Governments,
whereby the co. received 3s. of each list-
ener’s license fee for making its patents
free to the public, ran out at the end of
February and April respectively, and
were not renewed. To help offset the
loss of this moiety (it had reached nearly
£lOO,OOO p.a.), a licensing co., embrac-
ing A.W.A. and other patentees, has been
formed to sell sub-licenses to manufac-
turers. The market notes this, the con-
tinued growth of the business and the
comfortable state of the finances, and
prices the fully-paid pound shares, cov-
ered by 235. lOd. in net tangibles, at 41s.
6d. as against 345. a year ago. The
return at 41s. 6d. is 4.8 p.c. on a 10 p.c.
div. basis, which may not be beyond
the co.’s reach for the current term,
though it is by no means secure.
There was marked improvement in
the already comfortable financial posi-
tion :

The spring of £48,726 in the year’s net
earnings was due to a growth of £50,878
in the underwriting surplus (£115,349)
and of £1765 in returns from invest-
ments (£124,690) —the 1933 profit in-
cluded an unexplained addition of £3917.
The underwriting surplus and return
from investments were respectively 11.2
p.c. and 12 p.c. on capital, making the
net return from all sources 23.2 p.c. on
capital as against 18.5, 18.8, 13.2, 20.4
and 22.6 p.c. back to 1929. The div. was
kept at 13.3 p.c., and the £102,478 that
remained, together with £263,681 of inner
reserves disclosed, lifted the lay-by to
visibly twice the height of the £1,031,640
of paid capital; and £907,910 of the
£1,031,640 came from reserves. Inciden-
tally, the £263,681 brought from some-
where appears to have come mostly from
sundry creditors, etc. (now £58,946, down
£154,513), and the reserves for losses
outstanding (£93,565, down £78,730).
The market anticipates its benefits and
prices the fully-paid pound shares at
85s. as against 555. two years ago. At
the higher figure the return is 3.1 p.c.
on a 13.3 p.c. div. basis. The investor
who looks for 3| p.c., or a shade more,
on his money counts on a 16 p.c. div.,
or, what amounts to the same thing, a
one-for-one bonus issue and a 10 p.c.
div., which would call for £206,328 p.a.,
and only three times in the last decade
have net earnings amounted to less than
that.

The year’s spring of £21,934 in net
premiums, which are gathered from all
parts of the world, reflects the improve-
ment in conditions generally. Another
heartening feature is a further drop in
the expense rate. The loss experience
was one of the best in the last 20 years.
The current year’s figures will be affected
by “substantial claims arising out of the
recent typhoon in Japan.”

•Seventeen months.
The public became interested a dozen
years ago when it put up £lOO,OOO of
9 p.c. pref. money, and, as the eye sweeps
down the columns of the table, the figures
tell the story of the management’s suc-
cessful assault upon one problem after
another. At the start there was trouble
with stocks, but that was soon out of
the way, and, despite prolonged re-
building operations, net earnings con-
tinued to climb, reaching their peak in
1929, when there was enough to pay the
pref. div. and show 15.1 p.c. on ord.
capital. The board, therefore, had no
difficulty in getting in another £lOO,OOO of
8 p.c. second prefs. in order to ease the
strain on finances.
Then slump and all its concomitants
brought a fresh crop of troubles. Still,
the co. pulled through with enough to
pay the pref. divs. in 1931. In the fol-
lowing term gross earnings sprang
£18,925, the net result benefited by
£10,912 of the increase, the ords. got
into the picture again with 6 p.c., and
there has been a steady improvement in
turnover since. Last year’s gross earn-
ings (£219,300) were up £2281, and the
net result was £BOO better at £31,007, or
enough to pay 7.2 p.c. all round. But
the ord. div. was kept at 6 p.c., and the
prefs., owing to the statutory cut, got
6.9 p.c. and 6.2 p.c. respectively. They
are entitled to advance beyond these
levels up to their original contract rates
point for point with the ords.
The market notes this, and prices the
firsts at 275. and the seconds at 255. 3d.
The return at these figures is 5.1 p.c. and
4.8 p.c. respectively on the basis of last
year’s distribution. The net tangible cover
is £4 11s. lOd. firsts and £3 11s. lOd.
seconds. The ords. are not listed.

Expanding turnover has been accom-
panied by a persistent reduction in stocks
to the benefit of the financial position.
Last year stocks were reduced by £14,438,
and £13,117 was clipped off the debt,
which includes an unspecified amount
of mortgage. There was little change
in the more or less liquid surplus
(£60,825, including stocks), which has
improved by £76,479 over the last five
years.

With plenty of other people’s money in
its pockets, and with one eye on the
success of the parent co. in Sydney and
the other on the quick development of
an offshoot in Brisbane, the public more
than 10 times oversubscribed the
200,000 pound shares which this co.
offered in 1929. But the boom burst,
and the infant concern found itself
in a sea of troubles. In its first
two years trading losses aggregated
£24,109, which, together with good-
will, patents, etc., lifted the amount of
capital unrepresented by tangibles to
£82,690. In the following term the co.
turned the corner, and has continued to
make very good progress since. To
clear the way for divs., lighten the load
of goodwill, etc., and bring the book
value of fixed assets more into line with
fallen values, £82,825 was lopped off paid
capital, reducing it to £122,505 in 12s.
shares, of which 94,500 are fully paid
and the balance paid to 4s. 9d. To-
gether with £30,606 from the reserve for
depreciation, the cut enabled the p. and
1. debit to be rubbed out, goodwill and
rights to be reduced by £11,650, leaving
them at £40,000 (not treated as an asset
herein), and £69,650 to be clipped off the
plant item and £4986 off freeholds.
During the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts, operations were extended
to Tasmania, the weather was kind, and
declared net earnings were £5557 better
at 11.6 p.c. on the £122,505 of capital
as against 7.1 p.c. for the previous term.
That was after adding £8403 (up £718)
to the reserve for depreciation, etc., mak-
ing it £19,198. The div. was lifted a
couple of points to 8 p.c.
The existing factory is now reckoned
to be too small for requirements, and
a new one is to be put up on the co.’s
freehold at North Melbourne. No hint
is given as to whether shareholders are
likely to be asked for more. Here is the
position as balance-sheet figures show it :

The more or less liquid surplus (£32,456,
including stocks) was £13,577 stronger
than at the previous balance, and the
whole of the increase, and more besides,
was held in cash, etc., up £14,363.
The centenary celebrations should
give the current year’s earnings a further
lift, and the market, which looks upon
the show as an 8 p.c. proposition for the
time being, prices the fully-paids at 20s.
and the contribs. at 10s. 3d. At these
figures the return is 4.8 p.c. and 3.6 p.c.
respectively on the basis of last year’s
distribution. On the same basis the con-
tribs. would yield 5| p.c. when fully
paid.

This little Sydney catering co. went
downhill for a dozen years after re-
construction in 1910. Then the business
was brought up with a round turn;
£10,856 of the debt was funded, and
£6OOO-odd of 10 p.c. pref. capital was
gathered. During the six years to the
end of March, 1930, shareholders aver-
aged 9.4 p.c., and the £10,500 (6s. per
share) of ord. capital that went down the
sink in 1918 was restored. After that
the ords. experienced another three
years’ drought, slump and competition
having dried up earnings.
Now the business is on the up-grade
again, and the ords. are back in the pic-
ture, with enhanced prospects for the
current term, when the Prince’s visit
should help turnover in the catering busi-
ness. Gross earnings, which fell from
£16,532 in 1929 to £2988 in 1932, were
£8207 last year, when the improvement
was £2172. Including £5OO sent to the
depreciation reserve (£1677), the net re-
sult (up £799) was good enough to pay
an all-round 9.3 p.c. The ords. got 6 p.c.
and the prefs. 7| p.c. (10 p.c. less
statutory cut).
During the year £2643 was snipped off
the overdraft (£16,306), and £954 was
added to the amount coming to other
creditors:

The financial position, slightly obscured
by lumping plant and stock in one untidy
entry (up £641), will look better when
the debt can be further reduced. Much
depends upon whether expenditure out
of earnings on replacements and re-
newals proves to be adequate.
The market notes all this, the thin sup-
port for capital and the keenness of com-
petition, and prices the pound ords. at
16s. as against 12s. a year ago. At 16s.
the return is 7y p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis.

Few commodities have had a more
chequered career than rubber. This 21-
year-old Melbourne-controlled concern,
with plantations in the F.M.S., sold its
first crop for 4s. 9d. a pound and paid a
5 p.c. div., followed by another of 10
p.c. Then, after arguments with the
Courts and a cyclone, a second planta-
tion was bought. When the outlay on
development ceased the market collapsed,
and the the ords. had a long dry spell
until the Stevenson scheme pushed prices
beyond their economic limit.
The following table shows what has
happened over the last dozen years:

Rapid increase in production, following
collapse of the Stevenson scheme, and a
sharp contraction in demand, due to
slump and dulness in the motor trade,
brought about such an accumulation of
world stocks of rubber —over the four
years to the end of July last the growth
was 77,000-odd tons, raising the figure
to 677,765 tons —that prices fell to
little more than half the average cost of

A SURE FRIEND IN UNCERTAINTIMES
AMP
Money to Lend
ON MORTGAGE
THE Society is prepared to consider applications for
First Mortgages on Approved Freehold Properties,
and for loans to Local Governing Bodies, at lowest
Current Interest Rates. It will lend for a fixed term of
years or on the basis of periodic repayments, as may be
arranged.
In lending its funds to private borrowers, the Society
always points out the wisdom of protecting their estates
by having a Life Assurance policy to wipe out the mort-
gage at a certain date, or at death should that occur
first. An A.M.P. policy with this purpose acts as a
Sinking Fund such as can be created in no other way.
For instance:
In 1925 A.B. borrowed £l,OOO to build a house and,
although he already had two A.M.P. policies, he wisely
took out another £l,OOO policy to cover the risk of his
death before he had paid off the mortgage. This called
for a premium of less than a pound a week. He expected
to live for 20 or 30 years. He lived nine. He died early
this year, when the policy (for which he had paid only
£405 in all) yielded £1,290. The mortgage was paid off
and there was an extra £290 for the widow.
It is in this way that men can enter on mortgages with
a sense of security and peace of mind.
Full information regarding Mortgages and/or the
numerous A.M.P. plans of assurance, may be had from
any of the Society’s offices or counsellors. Particulars, if
desired, will be sent by mail.

THE GREATEST MUTUAL LIFE OFFICE IN

ASSETS £93,000,000
INVESTED IN THE COMMONWEALTH AND NEW ZEALAND
production. Hence the losses for the
three years to the close of accounts in
1933.
During the last term the whole out-
look changed. Production was 62,730
tons lighter, while the price was a shade
over 3d. per pound better. A profit of
£2280 ( = 2.3 p.c. on capital) showed up,
and further improvement can be ex-
pected. The £96,000 of capital is in
38,500 8 p.c. cum. par. prefs. (there was
£13,860 of accrued divs. coming to them
at June 30) and 57,500 ords. Creditors
figure for £326. Liquids total £4850;
the plantations are in at £90,790, and
plant, etc., £3857.
Early in 1930 it became evident that
something had to be done if many plan-
tations in the F.M.S. (here Britain has
invested upwards of 100 millions sterling
in rubber) and Dutch East Indies were
not to become jungle again. The native
problem stood in the way of Dutch co-
operation until the price fell to lfd. in
the middle of 1932. In April last the
two Governments and growers concerned
agreed to a 4|-year restriction of output
plan, and the London spot price of plan-
tation rubber rose sharply ; it has been
around 7d. per pound for the last few
weeks. At what level prices are likely
to settle down the “Wild Cat” doesn’t
know. But this co. reports that satis-
factory profits are being earned on pro-
visional export allowances. It is unable
to make a reliable estimate of the cur-
rent year’s harvest until the percentage
restriction and export credits are finally
determined.
For the purpose of examining, pros-
pecting and, if considered worth while,
floating gold propositions offered to it,
Mt. Morgan, Ltd., proposes to throw off
a subsidiary, Mt. Morgan Developments,
with a nominal capital of £250,000 in
ss. shares. Of these half a million are
to be offered to the parent’s shareholders
at par. At the moment the parent holds
an option from Swan Bitter over what
looks like a promising area south of
Wiluna (W.A.). The price is £73,000 —
£38,000 cash and the balance scrip in
any co. formed to work the property.
All this and a heartening improvement
in Mt. Morgan’s own production and
recovery figures have sent the ss. shares
to 365. on the market. At the present
rate of distribution (6d. a share quar-
terly), the return at 365. is 5| p.c.
The co.’s production figures for the
Jast three monthly periods compare as
follows:
f — : —Four Weeks Ended N
Aug. 22. Sept. 19. Oct. 17.

Gold, oz. ~ . . 2,233 2,072 2,837
Copper, tons . . 61 CO 90
With gold at £8 an ounce and copper at
£35 a ton (Australian currency), con-
centrates produced for the four weeks
to Oct. 17 were worth- over 14s. per ton
more than for the preceding month,
despite a drop in the gold assay value of
the ore. It looks like the success of the
Edquist process, which is also expected
to reduce costs.
* * * *
The Hawkwood, Upper Burnett
(C.Q.), is shaping well. Archold and
Runge, of North Arm, took over from
the company, and so far have treated
168 tons for 3600 z. gold bullion.
Sampling values were around 20z., so
crushings have panned out as expected.
The Narayen lease is the main standby,
and further development has opened up
the start of a new shoot, so far averag-
ing Bdwt. This is all-important as a
source of further supply, the rich shoot
having cut out. A dividend account has
not been opened yet, but before Christ-
mas shareholders expect to pocket 6d. a
share at least. A clinking little battery
and a cyanide plant were put up, just for
Narayen ore, and outsiders can come in
if they make the grade of stone.
* * * *
Early attempts to dredge or work the
alluvials on the Mary River, Gympie
(Q.), faded out long ago. But advances
in dredging practice and in the price of
gold put a much more favorable com-
plexion on present operations. On the
first unit the manager estimates two mil-
lion yards of an.average value of Is.
and those on the job are confident about
dividends. The nature and profile of
the bottom, which will be important con-
siderations, are not disclosed yet. If the
bottom is hard, ridgy slates, such as
occur on many parts of Gympie, recov-
eries equal to boring figures may prove
difficult to get. A diabase bottom would
be better, as it would likely be planed
down, without narrow furrows, and dia-
base seems the more likely.
* * * *
The drive for gold in the Cloncurry
district (N.Q.) has not yet made any mark
on the production tables. Here and there
prospectors located lodes that raised
hopes, but generally the reefs have been
patchy. Last year Herbert Gepp thought
the campaign worth encouraging. The
Soldier’s Cap, 30 miles out of Cloncurry,
is engaging attention. The prospectors
are getting out small tonnages of loz. to
3oz. grade, and two of the lodes, Mt.
Freda and the Comstock, promise ton-
nage if the average grade is right. These
have been taken under option by a
southern co., for which Loftus Hills
ran the tape over them. The Freda
has a width of up to 30ft. of rather
hungry-looking lode ; but on half that
width 7dwt., which doesn’t seem an im-
possibility, wduld pay. Government
sampling has shown sft. widths, assaying
up to as high as 18dwt. in the known
best section.

So far three interim distributions of
12} p.c. each (6d. a share) have been
made by Lake View in respect of the
year ended June 30, 1934, and a further
declaration is due at the end of October.
Recent buying in London of North Kal-
gurlis is attributed to div. expectations.
* # * *
Lake View is installing equipment,
identical in capacity and otherwise with
Golden Horseshoe’s plant, to treat the
big pile of residues on its recent acqui-
sition —the Associated. Treatment is a
three or four years’ job, and the profit
is variously estimated at from £150,000
to £200,000.
* * * *
Anglo-Australian option-holders con-
verted heavily to get into the Beryl float.
Altogether 480,000 options, with ss.
apiece sterling added, were exchanged
for Anglo shares, which carried the right
to subscribe for two Beryl shares at
par for every five Anglos held. When
all the money is in Anglo-Australian
will have an additional £120,000 of
working capital.
Commonwealth Mining ■ and Finance
(one of the De Bernales floats) has de-
cided to brush the cobwebs out of its far-
distant' Eureka mines, Northern Terri-
tory, and a diamond drill and extensive
mining equipment are now on their way
to the mine. Past owners are said to
have taken out nearly 30,0000 z. of bul-
lion, and nearly that amount of wealth is
declared to be still visible in the old
workings.
* * * *
Ives Reward (W.A.) is to make an-
other attempt to climb the golden stairs.
The co.’s till is empty, and debenture-
holders have a hold on its few assets ;
so reconstruction, satisfactory to all con-
cerned, is proposed. In the days when
gold in Australia was worth less than
half what it is now the co. promised to
crush its way to prosperity, but did not
succeed.
* * * *
8.A.N.Z., the English concern which
is interested in various leases at the
northern end of the Kalgoorlie Golden
Mile, is forming a co. in London to take
over and work the Mopoke and Gimlet
South leases, at Ora Banda (W.A.). On
the Gimlet there is a 40ft. lode, 500 ft.
long. At the moment, ore reserves of
both mines are estimated at 200,000 tons,
averaging sdwt. With a 95 p.c. extrac-
tion, a net profit of £lBO,OOO is expected
from this lot.
* * * *
Great Western Gold Development, not
the Havelock Option Co., as stated in
some quarters, has taken an option on
the Radio at Manxman, near Bullfinch
(W.A.). Carrying on in a small way, the
owners of this show have crushed nearly
8000 tons in the last 11 years for
27,0000 z. of gold. The Havelock Co. is
boring the adjoining Radio Deeps mine.
Hansel Mundy did likewise some years
ago, and then gave up.
* * * *
The tide of flotations is still at the
flood. The latest to see the light of day
is Kalgoorlie National, formed in Syd-
ney with a capital of £24,000 in 3s.
shares, of which 80,000 were offered and
taken. The properties are the Brown-
hill Consols, Brownhill Consols West,
Eastward Ho and Westward Ho, all on
the east of the Golden Mile and near
New Kalgurli.
%' * *
Australian Gold Development has
paid £lOOO deposit on the old Bank of
England lease, to the east of Boulder
Perseverance, on the Golden Mile
(W.A.). The property, which has pro-
duced only a small tonnage, was taken
over from Perseverance by' De Ber-
nales interests.
* * * *
Paringa (W.A.) has struck a sft. lode
on its Golden Mile show. The discovery
is in the south shaft, 400 ft. level, and
240 ft. north of the crosscut in the main
north drive. The ore, which assays
lljdwt., is still in the footwall. .
* * * *
Great Boulder had an option over the
White Hope, Hampton Plains (W.A.),
but, after diamond drilling, backed out.
Now an Adelaide concern has stepped in,
and the public has backed the float.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
N. 8.: At present price a speculation. Note-
holders stand in the way. Last estimate of
ore reserves was 550,000-odd tons, averaging
7dwt. The co. has a share interest in the Enter-
prise, sold to B. H. Prop M.W.: (1) and (2)
Both appear to be fully priced, and conditions
in the industry make the scrip very speculative
holdings. (3) and (4) A fair spec., but not
so good as Electrolytic. (5) In the past opera-
tions have been hindered by droughts and
floods. The new Lombong may make a differ-
ence, and as quota restrictions are lifted the
co.’s prospects should improve. (6) Better look
elsewhere. (7) Speculative, though they may
turn out all right in the long run Anxious:
(1) Present mine is scheduled to peter out next
year, but the co. has other strings to its bow.
(2) The co. has some powerful friends, which
makes it a good gamble as a holding proposi-
tion. (3) N 0... .K.A.L.: (1) Yes. (2) It
will be another year or so before the banks
can get costs properly in hand. (3) Yes....
Ratrut Basin: None, except in the event of
liquidation, and then the first prefs. rank in
front of the seconds for both capital and divs.
N.D.W.: (1) Yes. (2) Doubtful. (3)

pects, but heavily capitalised.

“Mala the Magnificent”
It is difficult to decide what it is in this
film, at Sydney Liberty, which rivets the
attention most —the veracity with which
it depicts its life or the sincerity and
directness of the story. Mala, an Eskimo
hunter, kills a white man. He is not
conscious of wrongdoing; he cannot see
why the white troopers should want to
hang him ; the whole thing is finished :
he is happy with his two wives, and the
only effect the incident has on him is a
determination not to go near the white
man’s ship again. More important than
the story is the background, the life of the
Dolores del Rio in “Madame Du Barry,”
Sydney Plaza.
little tribe he leads. They are seen attack-
ing huge herds of walruses and caribou,
and Mala harpoons a whale for the white
men. The glimpses of the home life of
the Eskimos, their simplicity and care
one for the other, the peculiar customs
of wife-lending and -changing, are more
interesting still. The weakest parts are
those in which whites appear.
“Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back”
Admirers of Bulldog Drummond will
probably be disappointed with Ronald
Colman’s impersonation. The man as
drawn by “Sapper” is by no means hand-
some ; only his eyes save him from being
ugly. Ronald Colman is a beauty-actor,
so “Bulldog” has to be a good-looking,
debonair young adventurer who seeks
dangerous situations and escapes every
time by sheer good luck. Colman’s
habit, when in a tight corner, of smiling
urbanely like a man sitting over a
doubled three no-trump call with four
aces and a long string of hearts would
make any self-respecting villain put a
bullet into him on principle, but Warner
Oland, though every inch a villain, re-
frains from doing so. Despite these
drawbacks the film is good entertainment,
although the humor loses a little by re-
petition, as when Algy (Chas. Butter-
worth) is continually torn away from his
newly-wedded bride, and the inspector
(C. Aubrey Smith) from his beauty
sleep ; or when Drummond’s witnesses
and corpses persistently disappear. At
Sydney State.
'“The Circus Clown”
Joe E. Brown’s phenomenal mouth is
given plenty of exercise in this opus, for
when he is not eating apples he is imi-
tating the roar of the lion. His career
as shepherd to the animals in an ex-
tensive menagerie is mildly funny, and
he at last attains his ambition and be-
comes a clown-cum-trapezist. The other
elements of the story have been ex-
ploited so often that even Hollywood
ought to be getting tired of them—the
lover who turns out to be a brother is
a typical example. At the Capitol.
“The Cat’s Paw”
After a long holiday Harold Lloyd,
one of the best real comedians the movies
have known, popped up again in “The
Cat’s Paw” at Melbourne Hoyt’s. This
time Lloyd is the son of an American
missionary settled in China. From child-
hood he has lived all his life in the back-
blocks of far Cathay, brought up in an
atmosphere of paternal piety and Chinese
literary philosophy. Innocent as a new-
laid egg, he finds himself back in his
home town —a live, roaring Western city
filled with corruption, vice, rackets and
all other modern American improve-
ments. The sudden death of a chosen
candidate for mayor leads the Reform
faction—which, as usual, is a trifle more
crooked than the crowd it opposes—to
pick on Lloyd as candidate. Much to its
surprise, he is elected, and when the
crooks start to get in their fine work,
anticipating that in his innocence he will
fall for all they suggest, they discover
that his very innocence is his greatest
strength. He meets all arguments with
some proverb from the works of Ying
Po, and, when the final showdown comes,
he establishes law and order by means of
a giant Mongolian headsman, a huge
snickersnee and a couple of fake corpses,
a device which takes in everybody, makes
hard-boiled police captains shudder and
gangsters who had laughed at the chair
faint in horror. The story is utterly
fantastic, but good acting makes it con-
vincing. Lloyd himself is as funny as
ever in his quiet way, Una Merkel is the
real thing as the smart wisecracking in-
formation girl at the hotel, George Bar-
bier makes a wonderful crooked poli-
tician, and the minor politicians and
other criminals are well-picked types.
“Madame Du Barry”
Reginald Owen is much the same
Louis XV. in this historical fantasia as
he was in “Voltaire,” a little older and
a little sorry for himself now the Pompa-
dour is dead. One can well realise the
pleasure he felt in the Du Barry, another
woman who could treat him as a man,
a woman who Richelieu tells him “can
look 18 or 30.” As the Du Barry Dolores
del Rio is delightful; impudent, laugh-
ing, gay, sulking and pouting, a little
bewildered at first, and then gaining in
confidence till she can take herself to
Court in spite of all the ladies of France.
These two are the only ones who matter ;
Richelieu and the Major-domo are well

drawn, but the others are merely
background, and not always effective

Sundry Shows.
The Russian Ballet co., which com-
menced its season at the Royal on Satur-
day night, received the usual hearty Syd-
ney welcome. Pavlova is dead, and her
mantle has fallen on Spessiva, who takes
an austere view of her highly-conven-
tionalised art and preserves throughout
her dancing the serenely pontifical air
worn by Heifetz and other humorless
virtuosos. The art of the ballet is as
artificial and almost as heavily encrusted
with tradition as that of the opera—the
one is emotion set to music, the other
music set to motion —and Australian
audiences, which see only two or three
expositions in 10 years, may be forgiven
if they lack full appreciation of the
niceties of the business.
Most successful of the ballets pre-
sented on Saturday night was “La Fille
Mai Gardee,” a simple little love-comedy
in pantomime and dance, with graceful,
shallow music by Hertel. The vivacious,
pretty Natasha Bojkovich and the hand-
some young Englishman Stanley Judson
made a very good impression, though
the scena was suffused with memories of
Pavlova. “Lac de Cygnes,” music by
Tschaikowsky at his most commonplace,
was chosen for the first appearance of
Spessiva and Anatole Vilzak. A proces-
sion of white tin swans, moving like
ducks in a shooting gallery, passes over
a lake backgrounded by mountains on
which shines a pink light never seen on
sea or land, and disappears O.P. Hunters
with crossbows arrive just too late to
pot them, but find instead a princess in
feathery garb and her entourage of young
ladies. Principal huntsman dances with
princess, frequently twirling her like a
teetotum. She registers deep emotion by
extending her right leg at right angles to
her body in a very dignified manner.
The ballerinas dance in circles, in fours,
now sedately, now madly.
A series of short dances, colorful and
effective, serves to introduce the rest of
the noted solo dancers to the audience.
Fourteen-year-old Juliana Enakieva earns
plaudits in a gitana. The programme
winds up with a scene from Borodin’s
“Prince Igor,” wild, tempestuous music,
tamely played, and a great deal of force-
ful dancing by warriors and maidens.
Intervals between sections are inordi-
nately long.

The main ingredient of “The Old
Folks at Home,” which opened at Syd-
ney Cri. on Thursday, is adultery, and
adultery is a grubby business, no matter
how smartly it is talked about. A mother,
to prevent her married daughter spilling
the beans about a lapse from virtue, re-
veals that for long years she has had a
lover, but has successfully hidden the
affair from all the world “for the sake of
the children.” The desire of the modern
generation to be frank about its sins is
denounced by the mother as exhibition-
ism and selfishness. Flavoring this fare
are a modern flapper who runs round
with a drunken, drug-taking journalist,
a popular novelist, a Viceroy of India,
a great scientist and a young aircraft
engineer.
Acting, as in this co.’s preceding pro-
duction, is much better than the play
deserves. Grace Lane, as the mother
with a secret, has a role eminently suited
to her talents; Jane Wood plays the self-
willed younger daughter with her usual
savage intensity, and Kathleen Goodall
plays an entirely new sort of part as a
rather vacuous young matron with
plenty of understanding. The old reli-
ables, Harvey Adams, Kenneth Bramp-
ton and Frank Bradley, are as competent
as ever. Gerald Savory’s notions of the
effects of drink-cwm-cocaine seem
peculiar, but doubtless there is room for
a good deal of variety. Most amusing
part of the play on the first night was
the astonishment of a young lady who
came on to make a 10 seconds’ silent
appearance as the maid who removed
the tea-things, and received an outburst
of applause that wouldn’t have been in-
adequate for Sybil Thorndike. No
wonder the profession loves Sydney
audiences!
* * *
Percy Grainger’s broadcast recitals
in Sydney last week were notable for the
variety of the fare provided. In the first,
in addition to some Bach, Schumann and
Chopin and the Cesar Franck Prelude,
Air arid Finale, all played beautifully,
there was Grainger’s own “Lullaby” from
the cantata “Tribute to Foster,” in which
the musical glasses are imitated very,, in-
geniously. David Guion, the American
cowboy pianist-composer, was repre-
sented by his “Turkey in the Straw’
transcription, which owed its. publication
to Grainger’s promise to include it in his
repertoire. It commences thinly like a
fiddle, and develops into a heavy-chorded
declamation that makes the old folk-tune
sound almost stately. Fanny Dillon’s
“Birds at Dawn” was made understand-
able and enjoyable by Grainger’s pre-
liminary analysis of the bird-calls that
form its thematic material.
In the second recital the most interest-
ing numbers were a masterly performance
of the Grieg “Ballade,” Grainger’s own
“free ramble” on the love duet from
Richard Strauss’s “Rosenkavalier” and
Balakireff’s “Islamey.” The last-named
Lionel Barrymore and Jean Harlow in
"Girl from Missouri,” Sydney St. James.
goes to prove, as musical ethnologists and
concert pianists have both discovered,
that if you scratch a Russian you find a
Tartar. The recital also included three
compositions in Brahms’s most romantic
vein, a Purcell minuet and Paradisi’s A
Major Toccata. Grainger seems to be
finding more and more joy in counter-
point. There surely never was a player
who gave such even-handed justice to
all the voices.

Wagner majestically ascended the steps
of the throne of song at Melbourne
Apollo one night last week, and reigned
there as musical dictator from 7.45 p.m.
till a few minutes before midnight. Had
the whole of “The Valkyrie’s” mighty
score been preserved the crammed house
would have been chained to its seats
and riveted to its standing-room for an-
other three-quarters of an hour, and the
taxi-drivers would have done a roaring
trade ; but producer Moor wisely gave
Melbourne a modified dose of the im-
mortal Richard’s anti-Italian medicine,
and the effect of the concentrated essence
was superb. From the first tap of the
De Abravanel baton to the fire-music’s
shuddering close, nothing that happened
was without significance, and the music
was married to the action, so that the eye
and the ear of the audience became a
single sense.
Briinnhilde Austral made her supreme
effort in connection with her famous
battle-cry, but the world’s greatest living
exponent of feminine Wagnerian roles
was magnificent from first to last.
There were moments of confusion
in the orchestral well when the Val-
kyrie maidens assembled on the moun-
taintop, but if the music was not
always impeccable it was never unwork-
manlike. The staging and the lighting
were extraordinarily good, and tran-
scended anything yet done for the Italian
school.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Fitzcray”: Melbourne is scratching
its head over the matter of finding a
fitting name for a foal born right oppo-
site the Town Hall. Ma was pulling a cart
and came suddenly round the corner into
full view of the Town Hall decorations.
That was enough, and the interesting
event was over in a few seconds. The
youngster was able to toddle after its
mother some few minutes later. Because
of its affable demeanor and the entranc-
ing thinness of its legs, the crowd was
strongly in favor of christen-
ing the newcomer the D
of G . There was the
question of lese - majeste,
however, and while this was
being argued someone point-
ed out the juvenile was of
the wrong sex.
“Mundowie”: Dan Has-
sett, an expert wielder of
stockwhips, is billed to show
the Duke of Gloucester how
they crack ’em on the cattle
camps. Hassett, who is an
old Queensland drover, was
taught to specialise in the art
by his father, the best in his
day in the western parts of
Vic. Another Victorian top-
notcher was Adam Hogg, a
celebrity of the 1860’s. But
Simon Fraser, living in Mel-
bourne, and now about 90,
was considered the king
of them all, both as whipmaker and
whipcracker. Some of his makes , are in
the museum in Buckingham Palace,
alongside a couple wielded before
royalty by Dan Hassett. Fraser was
a pupil of Nangus Jack, who used
to travel the country years ago mak-
ing and selling whips. Nangus was
found dead at last on the Old Man Plain
(N.S.W.) with one of his whips clutched
in his hand.
* # * Sj=
“Kingsley T.”: Nominate as the most
uncommon ledger ever kept in Australia
the one that was posted up by Paddy-the-
Flat in a Hall’s Creek (W.A.) store. Un-
able to read or write, his accounts con-
sisted of drawings of the articles bought.
Only one mistake was ever laid to his
charge, and that was when he debited
a customer with a cheese instead of a
grindstone. Paddy had omitted the dot
to represent the handle. The book is
now in Dublin Museum.
* * * *
“G.D.M.”: “Herpeton” (B. 3/10/’34)
errs in saying snakes have no scales, the
corrugations on his covering being merely
folds in an ordinary skin. Reptiles of
the order Ophidia are covered with an
integument bearing horny scales or
shields which make progression possible.
Authority? Dr. Gunther. “Folds” could
not assist a snake in moving over the
ground, to say nothing of climbing a
tree.
“Bitter Bark”: Didn’t know until a
few weeks ago that the black-snake was
a tree-climber. I cut down a pawpaw-
tree, and the wriggler slithered out of the
crown of leaves at the top.
* * He *
“Larrapinta”: The shag’s neck has
wonderful stretching powers —he can get
a one-pound rock-cod or leatherjacket
down after a lot of struggling—and he
has a cast-iron digestion. But he can’t
keep down one of those queer little
creatures called the “seahorse.” Time
and again I have seen a shag pop up
with one of these in his beak, but the
result is ever the same ; in a few seconds
the fowl starts to look uneasy and soon
begins to cut most extraordinary capers
—diving his head under the water, con-
torting his body, making vain attempts
to take wing, and all the time giving
every outward sign of a 40-horsepower
bellyache. Usually he manages to vomit
up the cause of the woe, lies flat out
on the water to recover from the ordeal,
takes wing at last in a groggy fashion and
flies to the nearest land, where he mopes
for hours, the picture of misery. Any-
one know why seahorse doesn’t agree
with a shag?
* * * *
“Lantana”: Tell “Mt. G.” (B.
26/9/’34) there are other ways of tell-
ing a bushman. He wears his hat in a
railway carriage and his hands are in-
variably half-closed. Townie keeps his
hands open.
“The 0.D.”: Another way to tell a
bushman in town. He’ll walk along the
street and look at everybody he passes.
That look has something of personal
interrogation in it, as distinct from the
stony stare of the city man. I’ve passed
dozens of city acquaintances in the street
and they never knew it, but none of my
friends from the back country has ever
missed me.
* H: H= *
“Wang”: He sat on a form in the bar-
room gazing at his dilapidated boots. I
bought the poor little fellow a pot out
of sympathy ; a man who had to wear
“Well, that oughter please the Prince!”
such awful “crabs” deserved it, I thought
“Surely you can manage to get a better
pair than that?” I said. With a wink
he replied, “Them boots is worth quids
to me, boss. Quids. I goes up t’ th’ front
door of a house, an’ when th’ missus
comes out I start larfin’ like mad. She
natcherly asks why, an’ I say, ‘ ’Scuse me,
missus, but I reelly can’t help it. Yer
mat’s ticklin’ me feet.’ That’s gen’rally
good enough. Sometimes they’re nearly
new.” He tapped a parcel lying
on the form alongside him. “Here’s
a pair I scored at a house round th’
corner. I nearly made th’ lady cry, an’
she sez she couldn’t stand seein’ me in
that state while her husband had a
coupler spare pairs.” I went out of the
bar chuckling. An hour later I got home
and found that the wife had given my
best shoes (thirty-five bob) to “a poor
unfortunate man whose boots were
nearly off his feet.”
* * * *
“Llewellyn”: On a station west of the
Darling (N.S.W.) an old bull has been
doing a double job for years. As soon
as dry weather sets in (that’s as soon as
the rain stops) he gathers some cows
about him and makes for the nearest
scrubland, where he breaks down tucker
for his harem. So long has he been doing
this that his horns are worn to smooth
stumps, but his condition and that of his
wives is a credit to his brains.
* * * *
“Aroona”: Somebody propounded the
contention a few weeks ago that kooka-
burras exiled from Australia tend to
become morosely dumb or, at all events,
that their notes are apt to lack in new
surroundings the fine, free, careless rap-
ture noticeable in the homeland. I
would like to tender some first-hand evi-
dence to the contrary. Over 50 years
ago my dad, an early-day S.A. squatter
who had returned to England, imported
some Australian fauna, among them a
brace of “jacks.” The birds were given
roomy quarters outside the stables, and
immediately began to brighten up the
calm, sequestered life of a Somersetshire
village. In fact, their quaint vociferous-
ness was making them immensely popu-
lar, especially with the younger folk,
when the vicar entered an emphatic pro-
test against the newcomers. His church
was only about 300 yards away, and he
complained that the importations dis-
tracted worshippers’ attention from the
service, though I doubt that they were
more noisy on Sunday than on any other
day. However, that settled it —the old
man being a churchwarden. The ’burras
went to the Regent’s Park Zoo.
* * * *
“Coolabah”: During a late thunder-
storm near Gosford (N.S.W.), a tree hold-
ing a wild-bees’ nest was struck. The
tree, a dead-and-gone bloodwood, was
split from top to bottom, and the hive
was divided. The bees continued to work
in the sundered nest, but when I set
about robbing the honey a few days back
I found that the inhabitants had split
up into two colonies, a new queen hav-
ing apparently set up in the separated
kingdom.
* H< * *
“O’Campbell”: “Froggo’s” find (B.
17/10/’34) is an old friend of mine—
the “red cross” toad; it is always
known as a toad. This bright-eyed little
chap is very popular, as he is only seen
when very big rain is coming—seems to
.scent it, and hops about licking up ants.
And when the deluge comes he is right
out in the midst of it with his twinkling
eyes and clear red cross (an Easter bun
hasn’t a more exact one). A true drought-
ender, Red Cross is never seen except in
rain and where “Froggo” unearthed him
—among some nice damp stones. His
body color in s.-w. Queensland is more
of a greeny-yellow than cream.
* * * *
“W.P.T.”: Don’t argue about the
color of a curlew’s egg, because it’s ten
to one you are both right; even if
four or five of you each have a different
opinion it’s quite possible that you are
still all right. This bird’s egg matches
its surroundings. I’ve seen curlews’ eggs
quite green, some more with a reddish
tinge, while others have been greyish.
The green eggs were laid in grass ; those
of reddish hue were laid in ironstone
country, and were so much like the sur-
roundings that it was hard to detect
them at all.
* * H= *
“Georgina”: I’ll back the Barkly
Tableland to produce more earth move-
ments than a centipede. I know of no
other country which can wriggle like it.
Early in the year, when the wet season
is in charge, the ground gets full and
tight— not in a bibulous sense ; it and I
are strictly sober. About May come
cracks which would make a giant jigsaw
puzzle look simple. The crust crumbles,
and the thing is a dead ashbed. By June
she’s tightened up again, having found
her new level. The cracks have gone ; the
crust is solid; things are right again. That
state continues till about the end of
October, by which time the crackling
heat of summer is on us. The earth gives
another bit of a shiver as the last drop
of moisture is drawn from her. She
opens up again, crumbles once more, and
lies there in great fissures waiting for
the rain. If it is long delayed, she'll
close again, having found a new level:
and so the opening and shutting go on
every year, and, for all I or anybody else
knows to the contrary, gaining and los-
ing new altitudes.
H= * * *
“Cudgerie”: “Tom Willie’s” river ferry
of sticks lashed together with stringy-
bark (B. 26/9/’34) is a clumsy affair com-
pared with “Top-rail’s” canvas boat,
and is, if anything, harder to construct.
Travelling usually with a couple of pack-
horses, I always carry apart from
rations, swag, rifle, etc. —an axe and a
12 x 14 tent fly, the latter essential during
the wet season. After cutting a couple of
saplings L then have with me all the
ingredients of “Top-rail’s” boat. I’ve
used it frequently and am still alive.
Let “T.W.” trade his patent to blokes
who don’t know any better.
# * * *
“Ned Kelly”: Here’s one vote for the
soldier-bird. A colony has taken up its
quarters in a big dead tea-tree at the
bottom of our yard. The missus relies
on the “soldiers” to wake her up to the
presence of intruders —stray cats, dogs
and strange stock pirating the cow’s feed
from the stable. Last week their frantic
chattering was the means of discovering
and dealing with two snakes —a green-
tree and a brown.
H= * * *
“Hotham”: Walter Hall Institute, Mel-
bourne, which specialises in preparing
antidotes for reptile bites, is
concerned about the stud and
stock snakes from which it
milks its supply of venom.
These are dying fast, and un-
less something can be done
it will not be long before
there will be nothing to make
anti-venom from. Snakes
outside the stud-farm, especi-
ally in Queensland, where most
of the reinforcements for the
Melbourne show come from,
are reported to be dying as
fast; so, why worry? When
all the poisonous brutes are
no more there will be no
need for serums or any other
sort of cure for snakebite.
Three-quarters of the snake
Abo. experts will cease to
contribute to The Bulletin,
and “Our Special Correspon-
dent” of the “S.M.H.” will
find the supply of pars, from
the Bungledore “B ugl e”
about the pretty girl of 33
who ligatured and sucked the snakebite
on her grandfather’s wooden leg is one
with Nineveh and Tyre.
“Elaps”: I am desolated at the news
that disease is decimating our snakes.
Cactoblastis was blamed, since the casual-
ties were heaviest in s.-w. Queensland,
where the death-adder, the tiger and the
copperhead used to flourish; but it
seems that Buckley’s fluke causes the
trouble. This is a wog that enters the
nostrils of these snakes during hiberna-
tion, which, in the case of the three
species named, occurs in damp river-
bottoms, and thereafter gives them Buck-
ley’s chance. Lovers of snakes are ear-
nestly enjoined to collect any wrigglers
inclined to go to sleep in such localities,
especially about Dirranbandi (Q.), and,
after blowing their noses and giving them
a sniff of eucalyptus, to remove them to
high country, notifying Melbourne of
the change of address.

“Airline”: Which is our most isolated
mail route? I nominate that which runs
between Oodnadatta and Granite Downs
(S.A.), a distance of 150 miles. The ser-
vice is a monthly one, and is the sole
link between those it serves and civilisa-
tion, even the telephone being denied
them. Its terminal point, the tumble-
down ruins of an abandoned homestead,
lies roughly at the south-eastern point
of the Musgrave Ranges. Mail day does
not mean merely a spin in the car, many
of the doggers, prospectors and block-
holders who make the connection travel-
ling long distances by camel in order
to do so. Much of the return freight
is wool, several small flocks of sheep
being established out there.
* * * *
“The 0.D.”: “Red Bill’s” waterhen
(B. 19/9/’34) may be too tough for a
hungry dog, but the Murray, cod has
no such finicky tastes. There was
what amounted to a plague of the red-
legs near Euston in 1918, and their
steak-like meat made the most attractive
bait I, an old river-roamer, ever used.
AN IDYLL FROM THE TWEED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Young Harry (he axeman, whistling, rode
through the scrubs around Mount Warning;
His heart with happiness overflowed
On that soft September morning.
He held a secret he thought was known
To himself and one other only,
And he wound by the tangled tracks alone,
Though he had never felt less lonely.
’Twas a lyrebird first that mimicked him
In a dell deep down and shady;
Then a wagtail called from a tea-tree limb:
“She’s such a sweet, pretty lady!”
Next a kookaburra laughed “Ha, ha!”
Then his mates began to shout it:
“Ha, ha! The maid of Murwillumbah!
Yes, we know all about it!”
The she-oak whispered: “A gracious lass!”
Old gum-trees looked sagacious;
And the wattle sighed to the sassafras:
“She’s as good as she is gracious.”
Said Harry: “You’d think each bird and tree
In the scrubs around Mount Warning
Must know that my Nell said ‘Yes’ to me
This very September morning!”

“Pons”: True animal-lovers will
regret to learn that the flea is in danger
of extinction ; indeed, a robust school
of scientists declares that Pulex irritans,
our companion through the ages, will
soon be only a memory. The looming
tragedy has its origins, of course, in our
rabid craze for cleanliness and the gen-
eral hatred of thick woollen underclothes.
All sorts of lethal methods which only
cause roars of derisive laughter amongst
the hardy bugs spell death to poor old
Pulex. You may gauge the gravity of
the position when I say that sideshow
proprietors will pay half a crown a dozen
for intelligent, athletic fleas. And who in
the world of athletics can compare with
these agile creatures? A Californian flea
holds the broad- and high-jump records
—l3in. and Bin. respectively. In terms of
human effort, these figures mean that a
“Did they give you and Sally the bridal chamber, Bert?”
"Didn’t see any bridles, boss, but there was a coupler ’orse-rugs on the bed.”
man of like powers could leap 36,000
miles horizontally or spring 22,000 miles
upwards, reaching the moon at the tenth
jump. It seems a sad reflection that such
noble beasts may one day be found only
in Charles Rothschild’s flea museum or
in some chance sty. For, apart from man,
the only real friend of Pulex is the farm-
yard pig.
* * * *
“J.J.8.”: “Llewellyn” (B. 26/9/’34) on
“bird accidents” mentions that he has
come across emus held by the leg in
fences. If he’d said he once saw an emu
held by the leg in a fence I wouldn’t
have said a word ; but when he talks of
such happenings in the plural I must
enter a protest. I reckon my old home-
stead holds a championship for get-
ting in the emu’s way. The big fowls
were always on the block, coming on
it or going off it. They used to get
caught, but by the time I got there they
were gone—with two or three chains of
the fence. On one special occasion they
flattened a whole 10 chains. Not once,
however, did the wire prove any use as
a trap. In case “Llewellyn” questions the
construction of my fences, they were
seven-wire (six plain, o’ne barb), with
posts sunk 18in. in the ground.
* * * *
“Erne”: Recent discussions in these
pages concerning the flight of eagles has
brought me in contact with a man who
says that, as a Scottish deerstalker, he
watched through
his stalking - glass
an eagle “fly” at
the rate of 120
m.p.h. His story
shows that the king
of birds, annoyed
by two of his sub-
jects on whose ter-
ritory he had tres-
passed—a pair of
peregrines, th e
boldest and swift-
est birds that fly—
“swooped” from
4000 ft. in the air
to a rock 2000 ft.
below in 45sec.,
time being taken
with a stopwatch.
But the “swooping” of an eagle or a
falcon is not flight. It is done with wings
closed or only partly open, and any pace
developed is due to the accelerated drop
of a body through space in ratio to the
square of the distance—see Musk. Regs.

In spite of the doubters,
Albany (W.A.) has quickly fulfilled its
promise to deliver the first tunny caught
locally this season to the Perth Museum.
It was netted and harpooned by Dick
Mcßride and his son. Six feet long,
4ft. 3in. in girth, and 1831 b., the fish
was packed in ice for the rail journey
to Perth.
* * * *
“Lanced”: Is the wild oat, alluded to
as “walking-oat,” the spear-grass of
Queensland? After rain, when the sun
comes out, the seeds writhe and twist like
live snakes and weave themselves into
tight masses. In some parts of the coun-
try sheep can’t be run, as these seeds work
right through their skins. Even on the
bigger cattle they are found right under
the hides. Put on the palm of the hand
and wet, the oat acts the same. On a trip
up the Barrier Reef some of our party
went one end of an island and the rest
the other. The first half are still getting
the seeds out of the clothes they wore,
and medical aid was needed for those
who got them into their socks, the mois-
ture of the feet being enough to start
them off. The other end of the island
did not grow the pest, and loud and long
was the laughter at the less fortunate, who
looked and felt like hairy goats.
* * * *
“Bitter Bark”: N.Q. scrubs would
seem unlikely places to find kindling for
a fire during the wet season, but abos.
manage. They look about for the nests
of white-ants, which, when broken open
and ignited, burn freely, though every-
thing else may be sodden.
Airline”: “Doug’s” method of catch-
ing eels (B. 3/10/’34) is not a bad one,
though hardly as entertaining as “bob-
bing.” For eels in bulk, however, I have
yet to see my own record beaten. Resid-
ing near a tidal river into which a com-
bined glue factory and sausage-skin
treatment plant emptied their waste
(those were the bad old days before such
practices became illegal in M.L.), I used
to wait until high water and then place
a bag over the outlet drain. The eels,
“Now, are you satisfied we
were out of petrol?”
entering the drain in search of titbits as
soon as the rising water permitted, would
make back towards the river—and the
sack—as the tide receded. Then the fun
started. A potato-bag filled with eels
weighs a bit, and many a time I was
forced to allow some of them to escape
in order to land the remainder. A local
fishmonger gave me sixpence a head,
delivered alive.

“Oustarde”: Queensland Government,
yielding to pastoralists, who have been
stressing its wonderful grasshopper-
devouring capacity, is to enforce the pro-
tection of the plain turkey
during the three varying sea-
sons of the year in which this
valuable bird has theoretical
protection in South, North
and Central Queensland. No
attempt whatever has been
made in the past to enforce
these laws, since to do so
would imperil votes, as in the
case of the native bear and
the ’possum, slain in billions
under the pretence of giving
the unemployed a chance.
The worst enemy of the tur-
key to-day, apart from the
fox, which eats the flightless
new-hatched birds, is the
motor-car. Even in the old
days, save when stuffed with
food in hot weather, the tur-
key was hard to get near on
foot or horseback, while a
buggy offered an easy way.
The car is more deadly. And where
the horse vehicle was driven by a small
and usually reliable section of the com-
munity, cars of sorts are now at the
command of whalers and sundowners
and their “sporting” kin.
“Tatters”: Grasshoppers are breeding
here (Warialda, N.S.W.) in millions.
About 35 come out of each hole, and a
square foot of land has up to 80 holes
in it. Breeding-places are bare patches,
and an acre would produce approxi-
mately fifty millions. A pity we haven’t
more wood-swallows and ibises, for
poisoning seems futile and dangerous.
Early this year I watched ibises at work
in one of my paddocks. The big fellows
stalked along slowly all day, and gorged
continually. Each must have swallowed
his own weight of the pest.
* * * *
“Rich. J.”: “Encue’s” experience (B.
10/10/’34) with “crocodiles” at Cardwell
(N.Q.) reminds me of an awful night
spent close to that town. Beating it back
to Cairns after a month at a Townsville
hotel, two cobbers and I were spreading
out our blankets a few miles from Card-
well when the local John happened along
and warned us of the dangers from man-
eating crocs, inhabiting a near-by
swamp. He also casually mentioned the
shooting a few days previously of an
18-footer on the post-office steps, and
remarked on the peculiarity of prowling
beasts in attacking the centre one of a
sleeping party, which, according to
animal reasoning, would naturally be the
weakest and least capable of resistance.
By dint of careful manoeuvring, Joe and
1 managed to get Fred nice and com-
fortable between us before we went to
sleep. An hour later I awoke to find
myself in the middle, with Fred placidly
sleeping on the outside. The changing
process went on stealthily nearly all
night, until at last we all went to sleep.
Towards dawn an awful screech from
Joe awakened us. “Good God!” he
yelled. “Look! Crocs.—dozens of
’em!” Creeping slowly towards us, now
only a few feet away, were several dark
and dreadful shapes. Frantic, we gained
a tree just as one shape snuffed at the
end of Joe’s blanket. From the branches
at break of day we were able to discern
several matronly cows nosing amongst
our sugar-bags.

“Hunter-Grubbe”: It isn’t only bull
seals that are apt to receive one
badly (B. 3/10/’34); the females also
can be very ferocious in the breeding
season. The young are born in Decem-
ber and January, and prospective parents
come ashore from November to January.
During this season the flippers lose their
timidity, and vigorously defend their
pups. The mothers are particularly fero-
cious, and on Julia Percy Islands diffi-
culty is often experienced in getting to
the lighthouse. Men wanting to land
have to grab clubs and sticks before
making the venture.
* * * *
“Bowen Hills”: One exhibit the Duke
should not be allowed to miss when visit-
ing Brisbane is the pair of outsize
ceratodi in the aquarium at the Museum.
Peculiar to Queensland, this unique air-
breathing fish was once confined to the,
Mary and Burnett rivers on the s.-e. coast.
As settlement came, one of the world’s
curiosities threatened to disappear. Wise
folk years ago began to distribute it to
other southern rivers, including the
Upper Brisbane, where now many
flourish. Enoggera reservoir, near Bris-
bane, is another great nursery for the fish,
which are guarded by a fine of £5O for
each one caught.

“Buzz”: Together with two farmers I
was returning in a sulky along the Fors-
ter-road from Taree (N.S.W.) to a prop-
erty at Stony Creek when in a shadowy
glade the old horse stopped, stif-
fened and tossed his head with great
deliberation. There at his feet crawled
a large green lobster, making a painful
passage across the rocky road. A wel-
come addition to the monotonous menu
of farm life; but old Prince now steps
with greater pace past that spot.
THE IDEALIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I've always been,” Long Bill remarked, “a
rather easy-going cuss
Who’s ambled down the Path of Life with
jist the minimum of fuss.
You never hear me chippin’ in when blokes
debate some knotty theme
And argue about bodyline or curse the Douglas
Credit scheme;
But when the conversation turns (as oft it
does in bush or town)
Io girls an’ all their little ways, then Hitler
couldn’t howl me down.
For one ideal I have had for ages in me heart
enshrined ;
I’ll always take a ticket on the dinkum rough-
an’-ready kind.
“ These townies make me ravin’ mad; it fairly
rasps a feller’s nerves
To hear them yap of beauty’s lure or boom
some skinny sheilah’s curves.
No matter if a maiden’s build suggests a thirty-
gallon cask,
Her shape cuts little ice with me; jist rough
an’ ready’s all I ask.
What matter if she drops her g’s or wolfs her
tucker like a shark
So long as she can shear a sheep or swing an
axe in ironbark?
There’s not a single city tart with fluffy hair
an’ powdered cheek
Who’d hold her own for half an hour with any
girl on Dingo Creek.
“I he girls back home on Dingo Creek would
hardly suit these city chumps,
For powder only means to them a handy way
of shifting stumps.
But, crikey! it would do you good to see them
skin a yearling steer
Or mount an’ ride a brumby colt without the
slightest sign of fear.
An’ jist to watch them cuttin’ scrub or puttin’
on a load of hay
Would make a feller yearn to get a marriage
license right away.
They’re rough an’ ready, sure enough,” con-
cluded Bill —“as rough as men ;
But when it comes to weddin’ me they’re not
so flamin’ ready then.”

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
SHED MANAGEMENT.
“Richmond”: “Brumby” (B. 3/10/’34)
says that no station-owner would in-
crease the number of rouseabouts once
shearing is under way, and adds that
this is never done “provided the wool is
being kept away and pressed.” Where’s
the need? No grower is in the business
for charity, but the man who will not
put on extra labor, if required, is to be
pitied.
A grower ought to strive the year
round to have his sheep in such a con-
dition as will achieve the best results in
his clip—keeping them out of dusty
yards, coping with flies, etc., and, if grass
is scarce, paying for agistment. It is not
feasible that the man who does so much
will botch the job for a ha’porth of tar
at shearing time.
“Brumby” should have a monument
if he can glance over the layout of
a shed, and say on the spot how many
“rousies” will be required. Practical
men usually get an idea after the first
day’s working, and the thing that influ-
ences them mostly is the wool they
have to handle.
Recently, we started shearing 5000
aged ewes and their lambs, owing to dry
conditions. They were short-woolled, so
the shedhands easily coped with them.
We followed with a line of heavy-cutting
hoggets, and had to add to the staff. Had
we adopted “Brumby’s” method, we
would have been either overstaffed the
first week or understaffed afterwards.
Apart from proficiency, the number of
“rousies” required must be according to
the class of sheep and the amount of
wool to be handled.
SETTING MACHINE SHEARS.
“Shearer”: A bit of advice for
novices: Be careful to get the right
cutter for the comb. When setting up
the shear, see that the cutter is about
■|ths of an inch back from the comb
points. This prevents the sheep from
injury and allows the tools to retain their
edge much longer. Adjust carefully so
that the cutter does not overlap either
side of the comb.
Those shears which take rock should
have approximately l-64th of an inch
put on to them.
Once the shear is set leave it alone,
except to oil it. Too often a learner
thinks that a bad-cutting sheep is the
fault of his machine, and makes need-
less adjustments. The result is that the
machine does cut badly afterwards.
Once a shear is properly set for the
class of sheep on tap it needs no adjust-
ment. If learners would remember this
they would save themselves time and
worry.
MORE DIPPING EXPERIENCE.
“Abol”: Dipping for fly is no experi-
ment if you use a good arsenical dip.
Here (s.-w. Queensland) we run about
10,000 sheep, and our losses this year
were nil, though our neighbors had a lot
of trouble. Our dip is the only one
within a 20-mile radius.
Of course, dipping does not solve the
fly trouble all the year, as you still have
to spray or crutch, but it does steady the
fly for the first four or five months, and
the smell stays on sheep for nine or ten
months. “W.D.McC.” (B. 26/9/’34)
states that every other kind of dip except
“walk-ins” is obsolete. My advice is:
Use the dip you are accustomed to.
We use a round 1200-gallon tank with
a 35ft. concrete race, with drop-in and
decoy pen. It has a capacity of 800 to
1000 sheep per hour with four men
working. With the round dip, if five or
six sheep rush in there is plenty of
room, and they will not smother.
HANDLING TENDER WOOLS.
“Marsh”: “A lot of partly-sound and
partly-tender fleeces are found in the
same bales,” said a Continental buyer
recently. It is true of many clips during
bad seasons, when the classer insists in
only testing a fleece about the neck and
shoulder portion.
If a tester is seen testing for tensility
in only one part of the fleece, he doesn’t
know his job. Wool may be sound in
one place and rotten elsewhere. The
staple should be tested at four points
at least. Partly-tender fleece must be
ousted from all sound wools.
Where numbers warrant, partly-sound
and partly-tender fleeces can be graded
by themselves, but in most cases it is
more payable to regard “50-50’s” as
wholly tender. Better to have some
sound wool in with the tender than to
have even lib. of tender wool in the
sound.
A mistake often made is the placing
of tender wools with short-stapled fleeces.
This borders on stupidity, as each type
of wool requires different manufacturing
treatment. Keep both types apart, even
though there is only enough of one or
the other to bag.
FLOCK-BREEDING FOR NOVICES.
“Doitnow”: First cull all “doggy”-
woolled and then all hairy-breeched
sheep, if possible. This must depend on
the numbers and class of sheep, also
your pocket; but they are of little value
as merino-wool growers, although good
mutton.
Now divide your breeding ewes into
mobs of a fair average wool evenness.
Keep 60-64’s together, 64-70’s and 70-74’s
if possible. If not, do the best you can.
All three classes of sheep grow excel-
lent wool, the strong and medium lines
often beating the fine wools in price pet-
head.
You must decide what your property
is the most suitable for, and breed ac-
cordingly. Personally, I think a good
medium wool is the most payable all-
round proposition. Keep your main
objective in view when selecting rams.
Join them with selected ewes to
bring the progeny of each mob to a
standard level, veering towards fine or
strong, according to your aim.
Each year cull out bad wool sheep
from amongst the breeding ewes and the
progeny. Replace the ewes with your
own breeding.
After about four years a marked im-
provement in your flocks should have
taken place, if your choice of rams is
right. You will find that you have gradu-
ally replaced the original mixed-woolled
flocks with sheep growing a fairly uni-
form fleece.
Soon you should be selling as culls
what were originally some of your best
flock sheep.
GID OR TURNSICK.
“B-gar”: Tapeworm eggs passed by
dogs and picked up by grazing sheep
hatch out in the stomach. The six-hooked
gid, liberated, fastens upon the mucous
membrane and bores its way into
the nearest blood-vessel, aiming to
reach the brain. Once there a cyst or
bladder forms and sets up inflammation.
Herein the future heads of tapeworms
form. The development of the sheep’s
brain stops, and death follows. *
Treatment is futile. The affected ani-
mals should be killed and care taken
that the heads are thoroughly burnt.
Should dogs eat the brains of gid-affected
sheep, the complete cycle of the tape-
worm is assured. It is claimed that gid
affects sheep only on country where
tame dogs and dingoes roam.
Dose your dogs regularly for tape-
worms with areca nut and santonine
mixed with treacle, followed by an
aperient.
SHEEP LOSSES.
“Fitz”: Losses of shorn sheep through
sudden changes to cold, rain and
wind have been heavy in N.S.W. this
year. It will pay graziers, even at' the
risk of a little loss of time, to turn
back into the shed shorn sheep, especi-
ally at nightfall.
In blade days these losses were rare,
and I think it can be accounted for, not
by the little extra bit of wool left on,
but because the body of the blade-shorn
sheep is not nearly so much inflamed by
blades as by the friction of the machine.
WHY SHEARERS ARE SCARCE.
“Patrick”: Scarcity of shearers is
causing concern and many men on the
board to-day would not a few years ago
see the first run through. The contract
system is mainly responsible for the
shortage. Contractor has no time for
learners, and when one does happen to
get a pen he has to go from the jump
for the lick of his life. Owners are to
blame, too. Anxious to get their wool
off they do not insist on the learners’
clause in agreements. It’s up to graziers’
associations to enforce the learners’ rule.
SELLING OLD EWES.
“F.L.8.”: When selling old ewes off
shears prepare them as follows.
Shear early to give them a chance to
pick up after their wool has been re-
moved. Wean their lambs at shearing ;
failing that, as soon as possible.
Next, drench them with bluestone and
mustard drench, being sure to yard over-
night, and hold them at least four hours
after the drenching. Nearly all old ewes
have worms. This enables them to take
full advantage of the early shearing.
Trim their feet, and remove any loose
teeth. Old ewes will thrive better as
“gummies” than with loose teeth. I
have seen them improve immediately
after doing this, and become a good fat
proposition.
Another good tip, especially for a fat-
lamb breeder, is to join them to long-
wool rams prior to selling, selecting those
rams for which you have no further use,
and selling the lot “joined to long-wools,
and rams thrown in.” It pays well to
buy a few for this purpose, as it makes
the whole mob so much more valuable.
Remember, however, that this only works
when the season is good. If this point
is in doubt, the tip should not be prac-
tised.
SORE BACKS.
“Cuchulain”: Some advice to “Blister”
(B. 10/10/’34): First, don’t get your
horse’s back sore. When he comes in
to work after a spell, wash his back with
salt and water as hot as he will stand
before saddling and when letting him go.
As “Blister” says, the aim in folding
the cloth is to keep the saddle off the
sore, but it must be folded exactly the
same way on each side, the main thing
being to prevent the saddle moving.
A “set-fast” can be cured all right,
though only in a working horse, but
patience is the main lotion. Wash the
back with hot water, increasing the tem-
perature until the prad protests. Then
massage for a bit with the hand. Do
this before saddling and when letting
him go. Pad up the saddle-cloth to
keep the weight off the sore spot. A
good plan with a bad sore is to take a
sheepskin with four or six months’ wool
and cut to size of saddle, with a hole over
the spot. (This is an old Arab trick.)
It takes the weight effectively from the
sore.
The practice of sluicing a hot horse’s
back with cold water and then re-
saddling and riding has been responsible
for as many sweat boils (and subsequent
“set-fasts”) as anything.
’HOPPER CONTROL.
“Valerin”: Do not try to poison the
swarms until they are a week or two old.
Until then they do not move far from
the hatching ground and are meagre
feeders.
On heavily-grassed or herbage coun-
try the bran bait is worthless. The
flakes cannot reach the ground and the
’hoppers.
Use a spray poison—11b. arsenite of
soda—and see that you get it with a
guaranteed strength of 80 p.c. Add lib.
sugar or treacle and Bgal. water. Spray
very lightly around and over the swarm.
The effect is both external and internal.
Don’t expeet to see results straight-
way. It may be two or three days be-
fore the poison gets to work.
It is waste of time to lay poison in
cold or wet weather. The pests never
move out until the day gets warm and
pleasant.
“Cuchulain”: The best method I know
of for destroying ’hoppers newly hatched,
before they take wing, comes from down
Quirindi (N.S.W.) way. Two men each
take an end of a length of No. 8 fencing-
wire about which has been rolled chaff-
bagging (or hessian) to a thickness of
6in. or Bin. This bagging is well satu-
rated with kerosene and set on fire, the
blaze being dragged across the spot
where the grasshoppers have freshly
hatched. This is a fairly cheap method
of wiping out huge numbers of the pest.
At Ganmain (N.S.W.) a grazier reckons
his method is a good one, too. He drives
a mob of sheep on to the hatching ground
and keeps them “ringing” till the ground
and insects are well trodden in.
“The 0.D.”: "Rone’s” poison mixture
(B. 17/10/’34) is correct, but his method
of preparation is unsatisfactory, because
when the molasses and arsenite of soda
are mixed together in hot water a chemical
reaction reduces the arsenious content of
the latter, and renders the bait ineffectual.
The of water should be divided
equally into separate tins, the lib. arsenite
dissolved in one, the 41b. molasses
in the other, and the contents of both
allowed to become almost cold before
being mixed. Then proceed to add the
241 b. of bran. Another point: Arsenite
of soda, as usually sold for agricultural
purposes, has only 65 p.c. arsenious con-
tent, and fib. of this is necessary for
results. Of arsenite with an 80 p.c.
arsenious content fib. is necessary.
Years ago on Tapalin we wiped out
a swarm by twisting old hessian round
a 60ft. length of fencing-wire, saturating

QUALITY IN WHEAT.
“G.L.”: I fully agree with “Fair Go”
(B. 3/10/’34) that strength is not required
by shippers of Australian wheat. All
the English miller expects in Australian
wheat is color and flavor; and as all
mainland States except Queensland grow
wheat for export they grow what is
suitable for their main market. Also it
must not be forgotten that the yield per
acre of the strong wheats is less than that
of the colory ones.
We have for a good many years in
Queensland grown a number of stronger
wheats to enable the baker to make the
high-piled loaf the public demands.
This class of grain produces more
loaves of bread to the ton than the
weaker varieties. The bread has a better
texture and is more palatable.
Our wheat is sold on the London
market f.a.q. and on its general reputa-
tion of color and flavor. When the Eng-
lish miller goes after strength he gets it
par excellence in No. 1 Spring
(Canadian). He would be amused to
think we claimed “strength” for Austra-
lian lines.
GRASS HARROWING.
“Knockinnon”: “Lion’s” estimate (B.
5/9/’34) of deposited fertility may be
open to question, but that does not
matter. Distribute your fertility, and
you will get a long way further with the
improvement of your pastures.
But there is harrowing and harrowing.
My experience is mostly trans-Tasman —
and in Maoriland we are frugal and put
a lot of trust in chain and tripod harrows.
These contraptions waggle along with
just that degree of erratic motion that
“Lion” suggests is needed. The rigid-
toothed harrow too often does a maxi-
mum of cutting and a minimum of dis-
tributing, and even under the most fav-
ored conditions cannot do the work of
the specially-designed varieties.

“Mudlark”: For brick-making choose
a loamy soil and use only to a depth of
six inches. Throw it into heaps and wet
it down to workable consistency. Mix
in the afternoons and mould in the morn-
ings on smooth ground in a tin-lined
mould. This allows water to thoroughly
permeate the stuff and saves a lot of
mixing. Cover the moulds with bags if
the weather is very hot.
Next morning, turn the bats on their
sides and square the bottoms with a
trowel. Treat the Opposite sides next
morning. Stack the bricks three high in
open formation at the end of a week.
If the walls are to be run up quickly,
a fortnight in warm weather is necessary
for curing. Spring and autumn are best
for bat-making. A handy size is 16in.
by Bin. by 6in. When building, excavate
for the foundation to a firm bottom 2ft.
wide, and build up with granite well
pugged in. If no granite or stone is
available use stiff clay pug well mixed
and rammed. Run two hoop-irons on
top of the foundations, two inches apart,
and the same on every third course. Bend
these up, nail to all frames and join at
the corners. Barbed wire is suitable from
Bft. upwards, but too stretchy for lower
courses.
Buildings with walls up to 9ft. and with
light roofs need only have pug founda-
tions, but see that water is drained well
away from them.
To finish off the interior, use ordinary
lime plaster or pug plaster. Use only the
top 2in. of soil, and sieve well. When
building, don’t finish off the joints and so
leave key holds for plaster. One gallon
boiled oil, ly pints water-glass and
cement to consistency make a weather-
proof wash for the outside. Outbuildings
can be protected with old transmission
oil. Don’t use old sump oil on plaster.
’Dobe buildings are cool in summer
and warm in winter, and if well con-
structed practically everlasting. I know
several over 50 years old as good as
when built, and in my bungalow, eight
years old, there is no sign of a flaw.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Dai R.”: A lot of sickness and mor-
tality among pigs in summer is traceable
to insufficient wallows. In the hot season
give the grunters access to a capacious
mud bath.
“Jim G.”: The life of a file will be
trebled if when being used it is rubbed
quickly and often over rough cloth —a
serge coat sleeve or trousers leg is
excellent. Best of all, use a small brush
with fine steel bristles.
“J.W.G.”: If a working horse has a
sore shoulder, don’t tamper with the
collar. If you must work him, use a
breastplate for a few days. If one is
not available, a dray harness breeching
or stout backhand will fill the bill, especi-
ally if an old motor-cycle tube is pulled
over the point where the draught is
heaviest.
“Wrash”: Sheep are stubborn to move
when it is necessary to shed them or
drive them through gates by night. Send
someone ahead with a lamp. They will
usually follow a light.
“Valerin”: My method of drenching
for internal worms is to do all the young
sheep, whether showing symptoms or not.
Fourteen days later give them a second
“shot.”
“J.G.”: A new collar should be soaked
in water for 48 hours. While it is still
wet harness the horse which is to wear it
and work for several hours. The collar
moulds itself to the horse’s neck and thus
avoids sore shoulders.
“Gumblegubbin”: To replace a broken
rail in a fence without making a slip-
panel of it remove the soil from
around a post and raise it with a lever,
canting it a little until the rails can be
lifted out'. Insert the new rail, shoul-
dered in the usual way, and drop the
post back into place.
“F.L.8.”: If you cannot class, skirt
all your fleeces, keeping lower lines
out, and bale together. Ask your
broker to have them classed, before sale.
The lower lines you should be able to
put up yourself if you know anything
about wool at all.
“Stren”: Before erecting the posts for
a six- or seven-wire fence bore the holes
for the bottom wire. The skin of your
knuckles is apt to suffer if you try to
do it when the post is up, and the other
method also saves time.
“A.G.T.”: Reverse worn harvester
segments on the wheel. Wood-pack
between the wheel- and segment-lugs to
secure correct position.
“J.T.”: A receptacle to hold bolts
and machinery parts whilst doing repairs
in the paddock can be made by bolting
a couple of old plough discs together;
the convex one acting as a stand, the
concave one as a tray.
“X.”: The small owner with a mixed
flock should place the brand on the same
side of the sheep as the earmark. This
is a great help in drafting, as brand
is much more quickly seen than the ear-
mark.
“Expert”: For removing hoop-bands
from woolpacks “F.L.8.” (B. 3/10/’34)
advocates a wrench. It can also be done
by using an L-shaped piece of lin. round
iron, slotted at end with a hacksaw
(using two blades in the frame) to a depth
of l|in. Where the woolpress has a
detachable handle on winch-drum slot
the end of winch-handle as described
above, and the pack-opener then is
always handy.
“McMud”: Two fowlhouses, one of
corrugated and the other of flat iron,
identical in every other respect, will
differ in temperature up to 18deg.
Had I known this eight months ago I
would be marketing about 300 ducks
this Christmas. I tried two of my houses
towards the end of the winter on six
different occasions. The gauges of iron
were identical. The thermometers were
correct —I had the Q’land Agricultural
Department test them after the first trial
and again when I had finished. The cor-
rugations evidently help to retain the
heat. Does anyone know why?
“Doitnow”: Now is the time in N.S.W.
to plant Kikuyu grass, which is suitable
to any class of soil that' is not binding.
The ruhners must be able to root well.
Kikuyu grows well where there is a
fair average climate, and where the rain-
fall is good. It is planted from cuttings,
obtainable from the Hawkesbury Agri-
cultural College, Richmond (N.S.W.), at
£1 per 1000 roots, f.o.r. Richmond.
“J.W.G.”: In my district it costs 10s.
to have a draught horse shod and Bs. for
one of the light sorts; so many of us
have been shoeing our own for some
years. I was over 50 when I started, and
after three lessons was able to shoe a
quiet horse. Cost: One set light shoes,
Is. 9d.; nails, 3d.; total, 2s. With the
horse working daily on unmetalled bush
roads this set lasted eight weeks. As I
work two sulky ponies continuously the
saving per year is considerable.

SPRING AND
SUMMER
SYDNEY HAS AN
IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL TO
HOLIDAY MAKERS.
Blue skies, a considerate sun, scintillating
ocean and harbor, clean, brilliant, safe
beaches call you now. Gorgeous gardens
and miles of orchards and farms in their spring
settings add to your pleasure. The Metropole is
in close juxtaposition to all these—as to all theatrical
and picture and other pleasure resorts. Sydney’s shops
with their displays are reached by tram. Winter Garden
with Orchestra. Terms from 6/6 per night (room only)
you will combine with economy the greatest comfort. Service is
not the slogan—it is the practice.

IN THE PUBLIC EYE.
I believe I am the most-photographed
man in Sydney. Cameras click as I light
my pipe, as 1 blow my nose, as I smile
and as I frown. They never tire. Each
day more photographs of me are taken
than on the day before.
It is not my own doing. My business
causes me to spend most of my time out
of doors, and there are photographers
on every corner.

CONFIRMED LOSER’S THEORY
Fortunately for those whose purchas-
ing power is unequal to coping with their
everyday requirements, other people are
constantly losing things. There is, how-
ever, one branch of the forgetful or
losing section of the community that is
of no use whatever to them—carefully
careless householders who only mislay
things in their own homes. Belonging
to this branch myself, I have developed
a search-for-lost-articles theory which
works quite well. Here and now, there-
fore, I present it to my fellow-losers.
You can nearly always find whatever
you want, when you don’t want it, by
looking where it wouldn’t be if you did.

So there is an Australian axe-scent.
FROM BAGDAD TO BILLY-O.
Talking of Bagdad reminds me of my
own experience of the place. I left there
with Gasper Wagbone in his Sizzling
Cornet a year or so ago on a night flight
to Allahabad. The Cornet was a local
product, and its speed was unknown. We
took off shortly after sunset in a dense
fog and a howling head wind.
Rising above the fog we opened her
out. Rapidly the indicator rose, showing
200, 300, 400 miles per hour. Then
the thing jambed. We sped on. At in-
tervals the fog would lift, allowing us to
distinguish the lights of cities below.
“Herat,” said I. “No, Jask,” replied
Wagbone.
I was sure it was Herat, but held my
peace. More lights . . . “Kabul,” I
claimed.
“No, Jaipur,” insisted Gasper.
I consulted my
map. He con-
sulted his. The
fog closed in
again. More
miles. More
lights.
Clearly it was
Lahore, despite
my colleague’s as-
sertion that we
were passing
Delhi.
Our tempers
were beginning to
rise, but fortu-
nately lights hove
in sight which we both recognised as
Allahabad.
“Here we are,” shouted Wagbone.
I was seized with the spirit of ad-
venture.
“Let’s keep on,” I urged. “Damn
Allahabad.”
“Good,” said Wagbone.
More hours passed. More lights were
sighted. Dissension broke out again.
“Look, Calcutta!” he bawled, pointing
to what were obviously the lights of Ran-
goon. We kept on, and soon passed
Singapore, which the idiot insisted was
Canton. I kept silent, knowing that
when we reached Darwin there would be
no disputing that I was right.
At last' the lights broke through again.
“Darwin,” I gloated. “Shanghai,” he
responded. “Much too big for Darwin.”
There was no time to argue, as our
petrol gave out at this moment. We
prepared to land.
An aerodrome showed up beneath us.
We made it.
Good heavens! Were we dreaming?
It was Bagdad.
“Jumping Bleriots!” I shouted. “We’re
made! We’ve flown non-stop around
the world.”
We congratulated each other heartily.
A crowd gathered. The Caliph’s Com-
missar forced his way towards us.
“What’s the matter with you guys?”
he demanded in courtly tones. “You’ve
been kicking up hell’s delight all night
and you haven’t left the place yet.”
The truth dawned upon us. The wind
had been so strong that it exactly coun-
terbalanced our speed. We’d been hover-
ing over Bagdad all night.
It was a great disappointment.

A HOPELESS CASE.
1 had long suspected that Bertram
Blobb wasn’t quite normal. My suspi-
cion was first aroused when he received
the report (fee, 10s.) that his gas meter
had been found to be perfectly satisfac-
tory, and read it with obvious surprise.
I had further confirmation when he told
me that he had appealed against his in-
come-tax assessment, and that he held
out great hopes of getting a rebate.
I thought he had reached the nadir of
mental instability when, on his wife an-
nouncing that her mother was coming
to spend the week-end with them, he in-
sisted on making her as comfortable as
possible.
The other day, 18 months after his
mother-in-law’s arrival, he was arrested
for attempted suicide. Almost I was
convinced that sanity was at last return-
ing to him, until I learned of the manner
of his abortive attempt to attain that
peace for which he craved.
Now I am more than ever convinced
that he’s not all there.
He was in a restaurant and he tried to
cut his throat with a table knife.

A TERRIBLE THOUGHT.
No sooner had I seen the man in the
corner taste his beer, shudder and set his
eyes on the pattern of the floorboards
than I knew he was married. I spoke
to him.
He jumped and half raised his arm
to ward a blow. “You startled me,
“Cen-TEEH-ary, Paddy!”
mister,” was his lame excuse. He
had half a dozen tries to drink that glass
of beer. Seeing a man shudder every
time he sips good beer always upsets me.
I inquired his trouble.
“Not married, mate, are you?” he
asked. My cheery reply made him sus-
picious, until I lied, and said that she
left me a year ago. “Well, look at this ”
he said, and passed over a marked news-
paper.
Man Elopes with Mother-in-law.
“Mister,” he said, as he once more
shuddered, “can you imagine it? Just
think what kind of wife that poor cow
•must have had.”

“A car horn that repeats ‘Get out of the
road' has been placed on the market.”
— "Telegraph.”
Why stop at that? Horns that swear
at other cars and mumble under their
breath at back-seat drivers should be in-
vented. Why not save the driver all the
trouble of talking? A special horn could
be installed to say “Got 60 out of her
last week”; “Always does 40 to the
gallon,” and so on. And probably the
best of the lot would be a ventriloquial
horn designed to distract the traffic
policeman’s attention at busy intersec-
tions, allowing the car to slip past un-
noticed.

A FEMININE FREAK.
“My wife,” said Blinks, “is one in a
million. No! I’m not going to pretend
that she has none of the eccentricities
and illogical ways common to her sex;
she has ’em the same as the rest. She
will bang into the kids when they annoy
her, and when they howl as a result she
weeps because she thinks she’s cruel to
them. She will audibly wonder, on see-
ing the woman opposite with a weird mil-
linery creation like a soup plate perched
precariously on the side of her head, how
on earth anyone could wear such a
stupid-looking thing, and then go and
buy one that looks even more ridi-
culous. She complains, of course, that
she never gets out anywhere, and when
I offer to take her somewhere says she
wants to stop home and finish cutting
out a dress. All these and other things,
which any married man knows, she does,
yet in one respect she is one in a million.

CHURCHMAN’S MITE.
“Threepence goes to church more often than
any other coin, but it does not boast about
it.”— Canon Hammond.
A florin backed last Saturday
A trotting horse that couldn’t trot.
A shilling saw a movie-play,
And sixpence bought a foaming pot.

Proud of its destiny it’s not)
I kept until the Sabbath • day —
A nd that’s the coin the verger got!
P. O. M. C.
PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
X. — THE PROFESSOR.
Professors, when they get their chair
With cushioned seat and stipend ample,
Set out to teach the young by care-
Ful precept and example.
Students hang on ev’ry word,
Ardent and admiring,
While the prof.’s rich voice is heard,
Learned and inspiring.
That’s the theory; but the fact is
It don’t work out right in practice.
A professor is a man who knows some-
thing about everything and everything
about something. Sometimes, unfortu-
nately, he forgets the things he knows
about some things. This habit has earned
him a reputation for absent-mindedness,
which is altogether undeserved, because
it is safe to assume that when he appears
to forget something about something it
is because he is busy recalling something
about something else.
When a man becomes a professor, he
is given a Chair at a seat of learning.
Up to that point he may have been a
most active and athletic man, but once
he gets his Chair he sticks to it. With
the exception of pole-sitting, professing
is the most sedentary occupation known
to man.
Occasionally a professor may change
his Chair. This sometimes happens when
he feels the urge to profess something
else: as, for instance, when second-hand
copies of his textbooks
have so flooded the market
that a new edition is im-
practicable. For the same
reason he sometimes mi-
grates to another seat of
learning, but it is a pretty
safe bet that he’ll die in
his Chair.
The professor spends a
short time each day giving
lectures to his students. It
is a point of honor among
students to attend a cer-
tain number of these lec-
tures, although, of course,
they agree that there is
very little of value to be
gained from them. The
brighter students also ar-
range tutorial classes,
which serve to keep the
professor abreast of mod-
ern thought.
The bane of the pro-
fessor’s existence is the
failure. Not that he is
ungenerous. He recog-
nises that all students
cannot be equally bril-
liant, and that some must
fail; but it is most' discon-
certing to have in his
class a student who has heard all
his jokes 12 months ago, and greets
them with a bored expression and a
stony silence, or, worse than that, recog-
nises the symptoms and steals the pro-
fessor’s thunder by whispering the witti-
cisms to his neighbors in advance.
Accordingly, professors are much more
lenient in marking papers than might be
expected, and many a student owes his
pass to the fact that he looks like a
potential joke-spoiler.
After all, a professor is a human being,
and doesn’t like to have his jokes fall
flat.
JASBY.
EX-PENSIVE!
Before he bought the wedding ring,
He swore she was the dearest thing
He knew. But now they’re wed and
she’s his own,
And he gets stung for each big bill
That she runs up, he’s swearing still —
She's quite the dearest thing he’s ever
known !

I have heard it said that a blind person is
unable to make a will. Is this a fact ? If so,
how does he bequeath his property 3—3977.
A blind person is quite competent to make
a will. The “mark” of a testator is a sufficient
signature whether he can write or not. Any
person, even though he may be also an attest-
ing witness, may, by the testator’s direction, sign
the testator’s name. The signature thus made
must be acknowledged by the testator in the
presence of the two witnesses. It is advis-
able to append to the attestation words indi-
cating that the signature has been so made by
testator’s direction, and that the contents
of the will have been read over to him and
acknowledged as his last will and testament.
Can you recommend a good Shakspearean
commentator, as I am desirous of making a
serious study of the Bard’s works ? —3903.
The definitive text of Shakspeare’s works
preferred by modern scholars and prescribed
by Sydney Uni. is the Cambridge edition (Mac-
millan). This is used in conjunction with Dr.
H. H. Furness’s “Variorum” edition of Shak-
speare (J. B. Lippincott Co.), based on the
First Folio. About 18 of the plays have been
exhaustively treated, and the work is being
continued by Dr. Furness’s son, H. H. Furness,
jun. An excellent cheap one-volume edition
of the plays is “The Leopold Shakespeare”
(Cassell and Co.), containing Dr. F. J. Furni-
vall’s famous introduction.
How is Sir A. T. Quiller-Couch regarded as
a writer 3 What are some of his books ?
4001.
His verse is fair, but not highly inspired ;
his Cornish stories are fine without being works
of genius; in criticism, his “On the Art
of Writing” might very well be called a minor
classic. Novels: “Troy Town” (1888), “The
Adventures of Harry Revel” (1903), “Fort
Amity” (1904) and “Hocken and Hunken”
(1912). Verse: “Poems and Ballads” (1896)
and “The Vigil of Venus and Other Poems.”
Critical Essays: “Adventures in Criticism”
(1898), “On the Art of Writing” (1916) and
“On the Art of Reading” (1920).
My fox-terrier, 12 months old, is continually
shedding his coat; it comes out in, handfuls. I
have treated him for worms, and I can see no
skin disease. Cause and cure 3 —3650.
Shedding of the coat normally occurs twice
a year, in autumn and spring. Abnormal hair-
shedding is usually due to some want of func-
tion or actual disease. Where, as in your case,
the animal’s skin and general health are good
give one capsule containing 1.2 c.c. of aricyl
on four different occasions at intervals of three
days. The drug can be obtained front Fasset
and Johnson, ChalmetS-street, Sydney, and is
given by subcutaneous injection.
Two Alsatian dogs of mine died of distemper
recently. What is the cause of the disease and
how can it be treated 3 Where can l obtain a
book dealing with diseases in dogs, especially
Alsatians 3—3085.
_ Disease is due to infection with a specific
virus. Dogs showing symptoms of distemper
should be kept in scrupulously clean quarters
with plenty of fresh air and sunlight. Kennels
should be scrubbed out with disinfectants.
Food and. water, given in clean vessels, Should
be renewed frequently, and not left with the
discharges from nose and mouth. By the best
treatment that can be recommended at present,
use of anti-distemper serum, supplied by Bur-
roughs Wellcome, it is possible to immunise
dogs when distemper is rife. When the dog
becomes naturally affected the injection of a
large dose of serum will cut short the disease,
thus reducing the possibility of secondary in-
fections. No particular book can be recom-
mended.
(1) What is meant by the phrase “splitting
the atom” ? A definition of the atom 3—4007.
(1) Altering its nature by separating or break-
ing off some of its constituent electrons or pro-
tons. (2) All that can be said about it briefly
is that it is a constituent part of a molecule.
Molecules of helium contain only one atom;
other elements more. Conceptions of the nature
of the atom have been profoundly altered in
recent years. Jeans in “The New Background
of Science” (1933) says “each individual electron,
when inside an atom, has the complexity of a
whole railway system.” Heisenberg found that
he had to dismiss the concepts of absolute
time, absolute space and the luminiferous ether
before he could make atomic physics square
with observed facts. The subject is extraordi-
narily difficult, and the compilers of the most
modern textbooks of physics have fought shy
of attempting elementary expositions.
(1) What is the coned pronunciation of cen-
tenary ? A local radio announcer pronounces
it cen-teen-ary. (2) What is the form of gov-
ernment in India? —4052.
(1) Noah Webster in his dictionary of 1874
gives the pronunciation as centenary, but sug-
gests that the word may arise from a Latin
combination joining a hundred with years (cen-
tennary), in which case it should be pronounced
centenary, which was accepted _ English usage
up tilt recent years. Centeenary is sponsored by
some of the most authoritative contemporary
dictionaries, but it is nowhere explained how
the long “e” comes into it. (2) Administered
in England by the Secretary of State for India
and a Council of from eight to 12 members
appointed by him (this is the financial autho-
rity); in India by the Viceroy and an Executive
Council appointed by the Crown, advised by
a bicameral Legislature —Council of State and
Leg. Assembly. Present British policy is to
develop the degree of self-government till
Dominion status is attained.
Books required in a thoroughly up-to-date
and comprehensive reference library for an
author and journalist—the latest, most concise
and indispensable ? Approximate cost in Aus-
tralia ? —4033.
A good dictionary, latest Webster’s Inter-
national or new 2-vol. Oxford for preference,
“Encyclopaedia Britannica” with supplementary
volumes, latest “Statesman’s Year-Book” and
“Whitaker’s Almanac” and a really good atlas
(the “Times” atlas is reliable). Further than
these choice must be dictated by individual re-
quirements. Any large bookseller will quote
prices and offer alternatives for all save the
annuaries at a much lower figure.
I suffer very much with hives during the early
summer months. Cause and cure ? —3988.
The disorder is an inflammatory affection.
There is usually some irritation, which is in-
creased by friction and physical extremes. In
certain subjects the initial eruption begins after
eating an excess of acid foods; shellfish,
tomatoes, strawberries, oatmeal, etc., precipi-
tate the attack in those of fair or acid type.
Curtail condiments and heating foods, avoid ex-
tremes in the daily routine, and indulge in a
warm soda bath at night. Dab equal parts
liquid witch-hazel and calamine lotion over
affected parts twice daily for relief of irrita-
tion. Calcium or lime salts may be taken
internally if thin-blooded or amemic; diet de-
mands attention in the latter case.
When did astrology originate, and can you
give some information concerning its develop-
ment ? —3905.
Astrology is believed to have had its origin
in Babylon, 3000 years before the birth of Christ,
where the sun, the moon and the four planets
were identified in their movements with “the
seven gods.” Not only men and animals, but
vegetables and minerals were thought to be
under the dominion of the planets, and every
plant was a terrestrial star, every star a spirit-
ualised plant. Babylonian ideas spread to
Greece in the fourth and fifth centuries 8.c.,
and under Greek influence the scope of astro-
logy was so increased that all the sciences then
known, zoology, botany, anatomy and medi-
cine, were brought under a theory of planetary
influence, and every planet had its own color.
Astrology later became divided into two
branches, natural and judicial. Natural astro-
logy predicted the movements of the heavenly
bodies, and judicial astrology “foretold the
destiny of man” by means of the planets.
Kepler spoke of astronomy as the wise mother
and astrology as the foolish daughter, but
added that the existence of the daughter was
necessary to the life of the mother.
I have read that Kipling’s “Recessional” was
founded on a well-known hymn. Can you tell
me where 1 may find this ? —‘3907.
Some people hold a theory that it is an
imitation of the “Hymn of the Hebrew Maid”
in “Ivanhoe.” The first eight lines of Scott’s
poem are:
When Israel of the Lord beloved
Out from the land of bondage came,
Her father’s God before her moved,
An awful guide in smoke and flame.
By day, along the astonished lands
The cloudy pillar glided slow-;
By night, Arabia’s erimsohed sands
Returned the fiery column’s glow.
A. G. Stephens many years ago in a Red
Page article indicated the sources (not hymns)
of some of the most effective phrases in “Re-
cessional.”
Can you tell me anything about Dr. Solo-
man, the eighteenth-century adventurer, and
his nostrum “Balm of Gilead” ? —‘3910.
Soloman started life by selling blacking at
Newcastle-on-Tyne. This and his second ven-
ture of running a newspaper in Liverpool
Were unsuccessful; but, turning to quackery, he
soon amassed a fortune with a “Balm of
Gilead,” which he sold for a guinea a bottle,
declaring that it contained nothing but pure
gold and balm of Mecca. His balm is sup-
posed to have been made of aromatised brandy.
How did Centennial Park, Sydney, get its
name ? —3909.
Centennial Park Was dedicated to the public
at the time of the Sydney centenary (1888)
through the foresight of Henry Parkes.
Titles of some novels likely to give an idea
of contemporary life in Russia, written by Rus-
sians who have lived or who are living under
the present regime in Russia, published in
Russia, and procurable in English translations in
Australia ? —3785.
See the “Times” Literary Supplement of De-
cember 28, 1933, which contains warm praise
of “Recent Soviet Novels.” Sholokhov, author
of “Quiet Flows the Don,” has written the
most widely successful of recent novels,
“Podniataya Tzelnia” (translated into English
under the title of “Virgin Soil”). There are
recent English translations of the following:
Ognyov's “The Diary of a Communist School-
boy” and “The Diary of a Communist Under-
graduate”; Kataev's “Speed Up, Time"’ (1933);
Leonov’s “The Thief” and “The Sot” (1929);
Pilnyak’s “The Volga Flows into the Caspian”
(1931); Babel's “Red Cavalry” (1927). All the
above volumes can be procured through Sydney
bookshops. There are, besides, two new an-
thologies : “Short Stories Out of Soviet
Russia,” edited by John Cournos (Dent);
“Bonfire; Stories Out of Soviet Russia,” edited
by S. Konovalov (Benn).
Can you suggest a good outline of world
knowledge, giving one an up-to-date account of
the various sciences ? —3904.
Best for your purpose is “The Seven Seals
of Science,” by Joseph Mayer, Ph.D. (The
Century Co.). This gives “an account of the
unfoldment of orderly knowledge and its
influence on human affairs,” and emphasises
the latest discoveries in all the great sciences,
as well as detailing the processes that led up
to these. The book makes very entertaining
reading.
What is the origin of the expression “Fabian
policy’’ ? —3906.
Fabius Maximus, the famous Roman general
and dictator at the time that Hannibal was
overrunning northern Italy, was noted for his
patience in following Hannibal but declining to
join battle with him. The policy of Fabius
was to wear down by attrition rather than risk
an action that might be fatal to Rome.
What to use to place the names of roses
on tin or other metal ? —3878.
Embossing with a steel punch is an everlast-
ing method. Place the tin or aluminium on
a firm base so that the metal will not be
broken on the reverse side. Alternatively, paint
the metal with a dark tint and write the names
in white paint, afterwards treating with clear
varnish. Labels should be painted to harmonise
with the stakes or the color of the stems.
Our tennis club runs tournaments each
Saturday afternoon in which each pair meets
each other pair as far as time will permit.
We experience difficulty in arranging the rounds
so as to avoid two pairs meeting twice, the
entries not being received till the start of the
tournament. Can you give a formula for work-
ing out this for any number of pairs ? —3963.
Supposing there are 10 pairs—A, B, C, D,
E, F, G, H, I and J. Start off with AB, AC,
AD and so on to AJ. Then commence a second
row with BC, and go on BD, BE, down to BJ.
Third row commences CD, and goes on CE,
CF, down to CJ. Continue this, with rows
headed DE, EF, FG, GH, HI, which will give
you 44 combinations —all that are possible.
The number of possible combinations is always
1 plus 2, plus 3, plus 4, plus 5.... up to one
less than the total number of pairs.
Conditions of the International One-act Play
Theatre’s competition for 1935, and to what

lished or produced professionally will be elig-
ible; amateur production will not disqualify.
The author’s name must not appear on the
script, but on a stamped and addressed envelope
for the return of the play. Entrance fee is
10s. 6d., which includes a year’s membership
of the 1.0.A.P.T. Entries must be in not
later than February 25 next year. Prizes are

How do Commonwealth electoral officers
conduct the scrutiny of Senate ballot-papers
and fill the three vacancies ? —3723.
First process is to count the first preference
votes given for each candidate. If any can-
didate has a majority of votes he is elected.
If no candidate has a majority, a second coutit
is made excluding the candidate who has re-
ceived ' the fewest first preference votes, each
ballot-paper counted to him being counted
to the candidate next in order of the voter’s
preference. If no candidate then has secured
a majority, the process of excluding the can-
didate who has the fewest votes and counting
each of his ballot-papers to the candidate
next in the order of the Voter’s preference is
repeated until one candidate receives an absolute
majority and becomes elected to the first
Vacancy. For the second vacancy, all the
ballot-papers are rearranged under the names
of respective candidates in accordance with
the first preferences indicated thereon, except
that each ballot-paper on which a first prefer-
ence for the elected candidate is indicated is
placed in the parcel of the candidate next in the
order of the voter’s preference. If no can-
didate then has an absolute majority, the pro-
cess of exclusion as outlined in the filling of
the first vacancy is continued until One can-
didate receives a majority and becomes elected.
The third vacancy is filled in the manner
described in filling the second vacancy, ex-
cept that each ballot-paper bearing a first pre-
ference for the second elected candidate, as well
as each ballot-paper bearing a first preference
for the first elected candidate, is first of all
placed in the parcel of the yet unelected can-
didate next in the order of the voter’s prefer-
ence. If necessary, the process of excluding
the candidate with the fewest votes counted
to him at that stage and distributing his ballot-
papers according to their next preferences is
undertaken, and the process of exclusion and
distribution is repeated until the third candidate
is elected.

(2) If so, buyers, and prices paid ? —3698.

tive scarcity. The world’s rarest postage stamp,
the 1-cent British Guiana, has been sold for
over £7OOO. Present issue Australian stamps,
on the other hand, are of practically no value.

THE PALETTE
The annual diminution in the square
inchage of stage and beach costumes
leaves people disappointed that they
cannot be shocked at Norman Lindsay s
work. The Melbourne exhibition opened
at Seddon's by the Peacock lady, a school-
fellow of the artist at Creswick, was
consequently attended largely by those
who find interest in the infinite imagina-
tion and subtle craftsmanship always
manifest in Lindsay’s etchings and water-
colors. All the water-colors and many of
the etchings are new to Melbourne, and
in the former Lindsay reveals a welcome
return to the warm tones which charac-
terised his earlier works. There was a
middle period during which he lowered
his tones to almost a uniformity of greys ;
but he has got over that and toys gamely
with brilliancy and light. His pictures,
as usual, deal largely with the supcr-
realisfic nudes which have ceased to
shock. He presents women with beauti-
ful figures and women with figures which
are not beautiful. The most attractive
water-color is that which the artist him-
self valued least —“The Ballet of the
Bull,” wherein one central figure stands
brilliant against a glow of light and half
a dozen others dance about her. The
anatomy throughout is excellent, and the
color charming. “Quartette,” a larger
picture, is a good example of delicate
color work, and “Sun Bathers” is Lindsay
at his best. Among the etchings “Desert
Island” shows perhaps the best quality,
with “Dancer and Discontent” running
it close. Altogether there are 101 etch-
ings, which suggests a mass-production
factory with high-speed machinery rather
than one solitary man working labor-
iously with a needle. Whether we like
or dislike Lindsay’s work we have to
stand hat in hand before the man’s un-
canny imagination and supernormal
faculty for hard work.
“Mostly artists” might have been a
stranger’s impression of the women of
Victoria after inspecting the 115 exhibits
of the Melbourne Society of Women
Painters at the Athenaeum. The four
walls of that large hall were covered
with a lot of medocrity, certainly, but
with a fair proportion of sound,
skilful work, sometimes work of con-
siderable beauty. A sprinkling of the
exhibitors tried to be modernistic,
with disastrous results. But, equally,
there were disasters among those who
tried to be orthodox. The society had
strengthened its display by works from
half a dozen outsiders, including Mar-
garet Preston and Thea Proctor, from
Sydney. Hilda Rix Nicholas exhibited a
neat sunlight effect, “The Fringed Para-
sol” ; Dora Wilson was represented by
an excellent street scene, and Anne Mont-
gomery by some gum-trees, which, un-
like most painting of the sort, conjured
up no Heysenesque memories. Stephanie
Taylor showed news instinct by giving
some pictures dealing with early Vic.
history, and Norah Gurdon handled
landscapes cleverly. Undistinguished
still-life, the work of Dora Serle, Violet
Mclnnes, Aileen Dent and Mable Pye
revealed individual qualities. A large,
full-length picture of Miss Barbara Dyer
by P. Hurry (Mrs. Farmer) attracted
probably the most attention from those
who had watched the progress of this
artist, because they realised that she had
now found herself. Violet Teague, I. H.
Tweddle and Adelaide Perry also showed
portraits of quality. Possibly because
they were out of the artistic ruck, the
sculpture of Ola Cohn and the pottery
of Marguerite Mahood found a ring of
spectators around them all day. The
earthenware statuettes and busts of the
latter bright little lady, who is at once
modeller, glazer and firer, sent her right
in the master class.
Harold Herbert perpetrated a cruel
joke on the Melbourne intelligentsia in
his exhibition of water-colors at Gill's.
Under the title “Oh, Yeah” he ventured
into Cubism, showing an artistic cock-
tail of an ocean liner, a strip of
railway track, an automatic pistol and a
tumbler, garnished with variegated radia-
tions. Even to those who knew Herbert
only by his conventional landscapes
it was an obvious legpull ; yet self-
appointed leaders of Culchaw gathered
around the picture with a reverence
which must have made the joker
weep. “It is not what you would
call beautiful, dear,” observed one
female intelligentsium, “but the sym-
bolism is exquisite.” Herbert’s serious
pictures were up to his usual standard,
though lacking the distinction which
is the outstanding quality of the drawings
he did in the South of France. There
are delightful gum-tree studies and dainty
Lome landscapes, washed in with un-
erring recklessness. Perhaps the pick of
the lot for color, breadth and atmo-
spheric effect are the three depicting Syl-
van Dam. One of these, “Evening,”
possesses the finest qualities in the whole
collection.
Vida Lahey has a good show at the
Gainsborough Gallery, Brisbane. She
is a deft painter of flowers: water
hyacinth, water-lilies, cosmos, bignonia
venusta, heartsease and nemesia, lobelia
and cornflowers, and she loves the sea
and the hills. A colorful seascape is
“Beach Umbrellas,” in which a crowd of
sun bathers and surfers disport themselves
on a hot, white beach, with a warm, blue
sky overhead and a warm, blue sea
breaking at their feet. Then there is a
study of the Lonely Beach, Stradbroke ;
just beach and sandhills and a grey sky.

Have you experienced the
uncanny feeling of pressing
your brake pedal and nothing
happens? Do not wait for
this experience to be yours,
but have your brakes watched
and adjusted at definite
periods in the same way as
you attend to the oiling of
your engine.
See that your brakes are fitted with .RAYBESTOS
BRAKE LININGS and so ensure reliability, uni-
form wear and safety.

RIDDING THE CAR OF SQUEAKS AND
RATTLES.
FURTHER “SPRING-CLEANING” HINTS.
BY FRED BERRY.
motorists have been fortunate enough to have had a
A thorough mechanical training, but a number of essential
adjustments can be made about the car without such knowledge,
for the modern automobile is designed with owner-driver
maintenance in view. Last week practical advice was given
to motorists who wish to put their cars into condition for the
coming season. This advice is here continued.
With the top overhaul of the motor
completed, the car should be taken out
on the road to test the correctness of
various adjustments and, incidentally, to
note the vast improvement that almost
certainly has followed in both accelera-

impellor and. dynamo. Correct belt

tion and in pulling. On returning to
the garage, with the motor still warm,
remove the plug from the sump and
drain out old lubricating oil. Take care
that the car is on a level surface during
this operation, otherwise a small quantity
of sludge may still remain in the crank-
case. Refill with a brand of oil recom-
mended by the makers, and work on ihe
engine is complete.
Electrical Units.
Attention should now be given to
accessories such as starter motor, gene-
rator and battery. It is safe to assume,
if they have been giving no trouble in
the past, that they are free of major
mechanical defects, but they are due for
cleaning and inspection. So far as starter
motor and generator are concerned it
will be found that after lengthy use
carbon from the brushes accumulates
to such an extent that the commutators
become dirty and show signs of scoring.
Slip off the end plates (spring-steel
bands), and with a clean rag or soft
brush soaked lightly in benzine remove
all traces of carbon Burnish the com-
mutator with a strip of very fine glass-
paper, but never in any circumstances
use emery-cloth, as the diamond-hard
particles of carborundum, falling from
the cloth, may enter the bearings and
cause extensive damage. Never run the
engine under power when cleaning the
commutator, for there will be a grave
danger of fire. Furthermore, the rag or
brush may be drawn round the armature
with disastrous results. Rotate the motor
slowly by use of the starting handle.
Now remove the vent plugs from the
cells of battery, note whether the plates
are exposed and, if necessary, “top over”
with distilled water. Scrape negative and
positive binding posts free from cor-
rosion, replace clips and smear liber-
ally with vaseline, thus ensuring maxi-
mum efficiency for a considerable period.
Removing Backlash.
Attention must now be given to steer-
ing and running gear, springs and
shackles. Motorists who are fortunate
enough to have a pit in the garage will
be saved a deal of time and inconveni-
ence at this stage. Carefully examine all
springs for possible breakages, oil liber-
ally with a half-and-half mixture of hot
lubricating oil and mineral turps, and
then, using a fixed spanner, go carefully
over all U-bolt nuts and see they are
drawn up tightly. The need for care
will be fully appreciated when it is
known that almost every spring fracture
is due to slack U-bolts, more particu-
larly where shock-absorbers are fitted to
the axle assembly. Tightening up slack
nuts on U-bolts or holding-down bolts
on bodywork crlls for no special skill,
but in every i. si . nee a fixed spanner
should be emplo>cd and pulled in a
clockwise direction. Left-hand threads
(anti-clockwise) are only used on axles
and one or two reciprocating parts of
the engine.
Should shock-absorbers be of the
“oil” type, remove the top plate and see
they are filled to capacity in order to
maintain efficiency, and, where webbing

With this done,

and note whether
the yoke adjust-
ments have been
tuned up to the
limit. If they are
it is plainly ask-
ing for trouble to
carry on; the

In removing slackness from steering
connections little can be done by the
amateur mechanic where pins and bush-
ings in the yokes are badly worn, but
improvement can be made by removing
the pins from each ball-joint and, after
thoroughly washing with benzine and in-
specting the springs, screwing in the ball-
housing a little further or (in cases of

very careful not to overdo this adjust-
ment, otherwise steering will be too
stiff to handle comfortably, and rapid
and unnecessary wear of the moving
parts will follow.
Last job in the pit will be to inspect the
level of lubricating oil in both gearbox
and differential. In case of shortage,
refill with light gear compound or heavy
engine oil, never (except in the cases of
extremely slack glands) using heavy,
viscous gear lubricants, as they cause
friction without any compensating
benefit.
With all mechanical units now in good
running order the next job will be to
restore coachwork, upholstery and ex-
terior finish to a satisfactory condition.
As modern exterior finishes are almost
wholly of the cellulose-lacquer type they
lend themselves admirably to amateur
reconditioning. With the ancient “paint-
and varnish” finish a damaged panel or
guard meant a complete repaint unless
the motorist was content with a patchy
job, but now anyone with a little care
and intelligence car. cover a blemish
satisfactorily. Colors used in lacquer
finishes on all standard bodies can be
obtained from the body-builders by
quoting the reference number, usually
embossed on a metal plate attached to
floorboards in the driver’s compart-
ment.
Touching-up Bodywork.
In cases where a considerable surface
is to be covered hand sprays operated
on the principle of a vaporiser can be
used, but on minor blemishes and in
the case of wings and valences brushing
lacquers make a remarkably effective
job. These are applied by means of a
camel-hair brush, and, provided reason-
able care is exercised in their application,
and assuming that the groundwork has
been carefully rubbed down and is per-
fectly smooth and free from grease,
there is no reason to expect anything
but a brilliant finish.
However careful a driver may be, he
will possibly find a number of small dents
in either mudguards or panels which,
while not serious defects, detract from
appearance. The complete restoration
to a perfect surface is not the difficult
matter many motorists suspect, for,
although a deep indentation may first
need a little careful hammering, the use
of special stopping putties will work
wonders. These stopping putties, for use
as a basis for cellulose lacquers, can be
obtained at any accessory house, and for
best results one should proceed as fol-

The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes. - -
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his

for the purpose. Clean off with a soft,
dry cloth, and then either brushing- or

Where shallow scratches appear on
bodywork a careful rubbing down with
“wet” sandpaper or one of the special
lacquer cutting compounds will level out
blemishes and restore the original sheen ;
care, of course, being taken not to carry
the cutting process to the extent of ex-
posing the under-surface or priming-coat.
Squeaks and Rattles.
This is the time to settle elusive noises
in coachwork. They can only be located
by a process of elimination. Doors
sometimes rattle, and by opening each in
turn when the car is driven one can
usually detect whether the trouble is due
to faulty fitting or working of the several
parts. In any case, careful inspection
of the screws in hinges and a check-up
of the condition of rubber doorstops
will in most cases lead to a remedy.
Frequently annoying squeaks appear to
emanate from beneath the bonnet, but
the experienced mechanic usually spots
that trouble at first attempt. Fore and
aft of the engine compartment fabric
strips are threaded through the metal
framework for the purpose of insulating
the bonnet from radiator and scuttle.
After a season’s running these fabric
strips become hard and brittle, and in
extreme cases actually wear through
the metal covers. Under such severe
conditions the intense friction will cause
squeaks and rattles. If the motorist
would only take the trouble to keep
these cushion strips pliable by regular
application of castor oil front-end
squeaks would be wholly eliminated.
In cars with closed bodies, felt pack-
ings in windows become hard after a
certain period, and consequently add
their quota to the sum total of rattles
and squeaks. In this case the remedy is
obvious ; fit new felt packings and the
trouble ceases.
As a further precaution and in order
to make perfectly sure the recon-
ditioned motor will not overheat, make
a careful inspection of the fan belt. As
this belt usually serves to drive fan,
water impellor and generator, any slack-
ness will be immediately reflected in low-

inefficient radiation. Many drivers are
content to carry on with the fan belt
adjustment out to the fullest extent, but
this short-sighted policy with its attendant
potential troubles is not warranted when
a new unit can be fitted for a few shil-
lings with the certain knowledge of a
full year’s trouble-free motoring ahead.
Educating the Pedestrian.
Civic authorities in almost every
country in the world are at present
studying traffic problems, with especial
regard to the safety of pedestrians. One
of the most interesting experiments is the
educative scheme set on foot by the
police and the principal motor and
cycling associations of Holland, under
which children, especially in the more
crowded quarters of Amsterdam, are
periodically instructed and examined
over traffic questions. The instruction is
in the hands of a private body, assisted
by the traffic police, who conduct the
examinations and present medals to suc-
cessful children. Instruction and ex-
amination take place in the streets, where
natural problems arise ; but in some cases
elementary teaching is given in school
yards or quiet squares, where models of
vehicles and traffic signals are used to
familiarise the children with dangers and
the proper way to avoid them.
According to one of Holland’s principal
traffic experts, who has studied the ques-
tion in other busy centres of Europe and
America, this system of making the child-
ren thoroughly familiar with traffic
dangers and the obligations of the pedes-
trian is proving very successful.
Another interesting move in the direc-
tion of educating the public has been the
preparation and general exhibition of a
cinema film illustrating traffic dangers
and instructing pedestrians in the proper
use of the road. This film, produced by
the traffic police and the principal motor-
ing and cycling associations of Holland,
working together, is said to be very
cleverly made up. It has a general re-
lease throughout the whole country, and
is shown in practically every cinema of
any consequence. It may be difficult to
judge with any sort of precision the re-
sults of such efforts, but Holland has a
comparatively low rate of road accidents.
The following figures, showing fatal
road accidents in 1933 in some of the
leading European cities, are interesting
(the figures are per 100,000 inhabitants):
Amsterdam 6.3, London 17.1, Birming-
ham 15.7, Liverpool 9.2, Leeds 15.7*
Berlin 7.6, Hamburg 8.5, Munich 9.8,

The Trouble Lamp.
D.P.N. (Hampton, Vic.). —7 have bought
a Dodge which has done 43,000 miles and
has just been rebored. (1) Should 7 continue
adding graphite to engine oil each change ?
(2) What quantity does the sump hold ? (3)
The car “tosses” badly over rough roads; how
can I stiffen the Lovejoy shock absorbers ?
(1) Continue for the next 5000 miles at
least. (2) Six quarts. (3) Either fit stronger
valves or use heavier lubricating oil —perhaps
both will be necessary. An alternative method
would be to tape the springs to secure the
desired stiffness.
A.J.B. (Aloomba, N.Q.). —(1) Who controls
the Luton factory at which Vauxhalls are
made? (2) Are the parts of the VX Vaux-
hall made and assembled by British workmen ?
(3) Names of other completely British cars on
the Australian market ?
(1) General Motors. (2) Yes. (3) Standard,
Hillman, Humber, Singer, Armstrong-Siddeley,
Sunbeam, Rover, Wolsley, etc.
C.L.L. (Watchupga, Vic.). —Can Pyroil liquid

The Bulletin course ? (2) 7 am now getting
21 m.p.g.; should this be bettered?
(1) No. (2) Average fuel consumption should

R.A.P. (Serpentine, W.A.). —(1) What are
the respective merits and reliability of sleeve
valves, overhead valves and poppet valves ?
(2) Respective merits of magneto and coil-
and-battery ignition systems, and which is used
in aero, engines ?
<1) Given identical standards of construc-
tion, the number of moving parts must govern
reliability, so that sleeve, poppet and overhead
valves must be rated in that order. With
regard to efficiency, it is generally accepted
that o.h.v. lead the way, followed in order
by poppet and sleeve valves. (2) There is little
to choose between magneto and coil-and-bat-
tery systems, for from an electrical viewpoint
they can be constructed to function in an
identical manner. Coil-and-battery ignition is
almost invariably fitted, except in the case of
ultra-high-speed motors. Both systems are
used on modern aircraft engines.
P.I. (Rochester, Vic.). —My Model T Ford.
1927. boils about every five miles. Cause and
cure ? It runs well otherwise.
Probably the commutator is badly worn, re-
sulting in retarded ignition point. This can
be checked by noting whether the spark lever
can be fully advanced in starting. The remedy
in this case is to fit a new commutator. An-
other possible trouble may be pocketed valves,
due to excessive valve-grinding (see B.
24/10/’34). Only cure is to have valve seat-
ings built up or inserts made. Check tappet
clearance, tension of fan belt and condition
of radiator core and water passages in cylinder
block.
E.A.F. (Corfield, C.Q.). —Which of the two
trucks {named) should 1 buy for station work ?
Roads are good and the truck would not be
excessively knocked about.
Both are reliable and give excellent service
under even difficult conditions. The lighter
truck will cost less to operate, but the heavier
is the sounder investment from both a service
and capital viewpoint.
R.H. (Wollongong, N.S.W.). —Miles from any
garage one of the studs came adrift from the
hydraulic brake gear of my car, letting all oil
run out on the road. 7 filled up with lubricat-
ing oil, but now the brakes are very erratic.
What should I do ?
Only safe method is to procure the special
oil made for hydraulic-brake gear. A mixture
of one-third methylated spirits and two-thirds
medicinal castor oil should see you through
until the correct oil is obtainable. Never use
mineral oil, as it will ruin washers in pump
cylinders.
B.G. (Tambo, Q.). —I am thinking of buying
a 1928 sleeve-valve car which has done about
30,000 miles. Oil consumption is heavy.
150/200 m.p.g. How can this be stopped, and
what petrol consumption should l expect ?
The engine has probably been just decar-
bonised, and in old sleeve-valve motors this
invariably means an immediate increase in oil
consumption. After some time carbon forms
between the surface of the sleeves and con-
sumption returns to normal, but in cases of
excessive wear the only remedy is to fit new
sleeves. You should expect 12/14 m.p.g.
petrol consumption.
J.F. (Summervale Siding, N.S.W.). —7 pro-
pose motoring from Nyngan to Armidale.
What is the shortest route consistent with
running economy; also distances between
towns ?
Nyngan to Nevertire (36 miles), Warren
(13), Gilgandra (52), Tooraweenah (28), Coona-
barabran (35), Mullahey (42), Gunnedah (24),
Somerton (24), Tamworth (23), Uralla (60),
Armidale (13); total 350 miles. The road be-
tween Tooraweenah and Coonabarabran is
rough and hilly under best conditions, and
impassable in wet weather.
A.B.C. (Mt. Coolon, C.Q.). —When my
engine speed gets low the headlights get dim,
and on bad road l have to change down to
keep up engine speed for the lights. Trouble
persisted after fitting new battery. What’s the
remedy ?
See that earth connection of battery to
chassis is clean and tight; also examine wiring
and cut-out, as there is evidently a serious
“short” somewhere in the system.

SHORT-WAVE PROS AND CONS.
(No. 2.)
BU DPM B. KNOCK.
The layout or placement of the various parts of a short-wave receiver
plays an important part in performance. The object in such construction,
irrespective of type, should be to keep radio-frequency circuit wiring as
short and direct as is possible without cramping components.
A 1 though in short-wave reception the
frequencies to be dealt with are much
higher than those used for normal broad-
cast reception, and tuning is apparently
much sharper and more exacting, one
cannot expect ease of control if the re-
Fig. 1.—Even with a simple two-valve receiver, as
indicated by this circuit diagram, care must be exercised
in the correct placement of parts.
ceiver itself is at fault from the com-
mencement.
To the constructor experienced in the
ways of short-wave receivers examina-
tion of a circuit diagram is sufficient to
show how the receiver should look to
the eye, but to the man who is making
his first attempt the circuit diagram pro-
vides only a small glimmer of light in
the darkness. If the constructor could
have on the workbench a model receiver
as a guide, little difficulty would be en-
countered in duplicating the original, but
a model is rarely available. The dia-
grams are usually fairly complete, but
there is often a lot of detail lacking.
Thus one has to read between the lines
of a condensed description.
Before discussing the placement of in-
dividual components, the first thing to
consider is the position of controls. If
these, particularly the tuning and re-
generation controls, are placed awk-
wardly, the manipulation of the receiver
can become tiresome. These controls
should be so placed that they fall within
ready reach of the hands, and should
preferably be arranged near the base of
the receiver and not high up on a panel.
The arms can then be rested on the table
and tuning done from the wrists. This
calls for no effort. If the controls are
high the arms must be unsupported, and
that gets wearisome after a little while.
The reader may retort:
“What about commercial
receivers of the communi-
cations type, such as are
used in the world’s big re-
ceiving centres?” The
answer is that such receiv-
ers are invariably used at
one particular frequency,
and a very occasional
touch on R.F. controls is
all that is needed. With
the international short-
wave listener a continual
surveillance over a very
wide range of frequencies
is necessary, and the con-
trols are used extensively.
The main tuning control
is better placed at the side
of the receiver chassis
than in front. Whether
this shall be the right- or
left-hand side is deter-
mined by whether the user
is right- or left-handed.
One may desire to make
notes during reception.
Right-handed people will find the left-
hand side for the tuning control most
convenient.
The regeneration control is not used
quite so much as the tuning and can be
at the front, but, alternatively, the right-
hand lower side of the chassis provides
a better location. An extended con-
denser shaft becomes necessary if this is
done.
There is normally no need for an in-
dicating dial for regeneration, but with
the main tuning control it is essential.
If the idea of putting the tuning control
at the left of the chassis is followed a
drum-dial indicator projecting through
the front of the panel and mounted on
a lengthened condenser shaft can be im-
provised. An old-fashioned bakelite-
case vernier dial can
be used with advan-
tage as the drive,
and does not detract
from appearance,
not being at the
front of the receiver.
If an old vernier dial
is used make sure it
is free from slip or
backlash.
Metal Chassis or
Baseboard?
It may seem out
of place even to sug-
gest a wooden base-
board in these en-
lightened times, as
the metal base (pre-
ferably of alumin-
ium for lightness
and workability’s
sake) has everything in its favor. Wiring
is simplified considerably, and screening
may be made very complete where re-
quired. There are constructors, how-
ever, who will want to try different lay-
out arrangements and different circuits
embodying the various oscillation-control
methods. The wooden baseboard is
convenient for such experimentation, it
being easy to shift components about and
to remount them with small screws.
A Layout Example.
The circuit diagram of Fig. 1 shows a
two-valve receiver, battery-operated and
of the well-known Reinartz breed. The
two valves are triodes and the audio
coupling by transformer. This kind of
receiver is the easiest of all to start off
with, and has been described all over the
world in countless frilled forms. It re-
mains, nevertheless, fundamentally as in
the diagram.
If this receiver is made with the addi-
tion of an untuned R.F. stage (other-
wise an aerial-coupling valve), there is
not the same necessity for complete
screening as with a tuned stage, and yet
there is the advantage of being able to
couple any aerial to the receiver without
affecting regeneration. The untuned
stage is not recommended where the re-
ceiver is to be used near a local broad-
Fig. 2.—A suggested layout for a short-wave receiver with untuned
R.F. stage (aerial-coupling valve). The tuning control at the side*
of the chassis, operating the drum indicator at the front, is a particu-
larly convenient arrangement. The regeneration condenser can also
be arranged as shown by C 4.
casting station, but is quite useful in the
country and in some suburban locations.
Assuming that the reader contemplates
the layout of such a receiver, Fig. 2 can
be taken as a typical example. Although
this represents a view looking down on
a wooden baseboard, it can also be taken
as representative of a metal-base assem-
bly. In the latter case, the battery switch,
terminals and R.F. chokes can be con-
sidered as being mounted underneath the
base. As in this case the tuning control
is on the left, the condenser itself will
be mounted somewhere near the position
indicated. Note that the coil socket
(plug-in coils are assumed) and the detec-
tor-valve socket are placed in such a way
as to keep the leads to the tuning con-
denser short. If Jarge-diameter plug-in
coils are used they should not be placed
closer to the tuning condenser than two-
thirds of their diameter. In the case of
the metal chassis, the writer always
places plug-in coil mounts on distance
pillars at least ljin. above the base. It
is better thus to have slightly longer leads
than increased R.F. resistance due to
close proximity of metal. This applies
similarly to the metal plates of the tuning
condenser, the rotor of which is earthed.
The detector-valve socket is arranged so
that a direct and short lead can be taken
to the tuning condenser via the grid con-
denser, but the valve should not be in
the field of the coil. The reaction con-
denser is placed fairly close to the valve
holder on the panel, or, alternatively (as
suggested previously), as indicated by the
dotted lines. If a metal base is used this
Fig. 3. —An excellent example of forethought in the structural design of a
short-wave receiver. This is a “single-sideband” superheterodyne for use
exclusively on the congested amateur frequencies.
condenser can be mounted underneath
the top. The R.F. choke in the plate of
the detector is arranged close to the plate
terminal of the valve socket to prevent
R.F. currents straying from this circuit.
The three-section type honeycombs
should be used in short-wave receivers
in preference to the ordinary slot-wound
or single honeycomb chokes used in
broadcast work. The audio components
are not so vital in their placement, and
Ihese can be mounted wherever con-
venient, the main precaution being that
they must be out of the field of R.F.
components. Although, where using a
metal base, all the audio components can
be underneath, it is im-
portant that the detec-
tor grid circuits should
be above the earthed
base.
Connecting-up.
Even with a good layout the wiring
should not be done haphazardly. Wires
at high R.F. potential should be at least
an inch above an earthed base, and the
wire should be of 18-gauge tinned
copper, with insulating sleeving in pre-
ference to wiring flex. The regeneration
circuit carries R.F. current, but as this
is only for regeneration and not for
detection this circuit is not so critical.
Leads here, however, should be kept
away from grid circuits or fierce oscilla-
tion may be present, with the result that
the receiver will be practically uncon-
trollable. In connecting the grid coil to
the tuning condenser the connecting
wires should run straight to the con-
denser, and not make any large area loop
en route. Such a loop circuit, in with the
grid tuning, cap be responsible for the
undesirable hand-capacity effect so often
present in incorrectly-designed receivers.
Earthing leads should be made at one
central point on a baseboard layout, and,
in the case of a metal base, at two or
three widely-separated points, rather than
relying upon the* conductivity of the
chassis itself. A good plan is to run, in
either case, a busbar from end to end of
the baseboard or chassis, and earth con-
nections can then be made direct at the
most convenient points.
The position of a battery type screen-
grid valve for an aerial coupling stage is
illustrated in Fig. 2, and although a metal
partition is shown by the dotted line this
is not essential. If the R.F. valve were
tuned the screen would be indispensable.
As the usual method of coupling an un-
tuned stage to the detector is by means
of a capacity and R.F. coupling choke,
this choke should also be so placed that
it is clear of the field of the detector coil
and R.F. choke in the plate circuit of
the detector valve.

GRAINGER—A MUSICAL
MISSIONARY.
As a rule, the perform-
ances of virtuoso pianists
visiting Australia are not
broadcast; certainly not
in the city in which they
are giving a recital. The
A.B.C. has stepped over
that limitation in the
case of Percy Grainger,
and the Australian pian-
ist-composer’s concerts
in Adelaide, Melbourne
and Sydney have been
heard all over the con-
tinent. This is well, for
Grainger is not only the
greatest of Australian
musicians and one of the 10 great-
est living masters of pianoforte tech-
nique, but he is the most intelligent
and forceful of musical missionaries. His
zeal is tremendous, but it doesn’t con-
sume ; it rejuvenates its possessor.
Grainger was born in 1882, but he is as
vigorous, as open-minded and as whole-
heartedly in earnest as he was when the
waiter first heard him play 20 years ago.
Grainger’s public career goes back 14
years further than that, for he gave his
first series of public recitals at the age
of 18.
It may be said that he “discovered”
Edward Grieg, in the sense that he gave
that composer’s pianoforte works a
vastly wider audience than they had ever
had before. It was Grieg's originality of
mind and the unique personality of his
music that most attracted the youthful
Grainger. There is a legend, oft repeated,
that when Grainger first met Grieg he
played to the composer two of his suites
“that he had never heard performed be-
fore,” but, as Grieg was himself a very
accomplished pianist, the words “by any-
one else” seem to be a necessary addi-
tion. What Grainger did for Grieg he
also did for his intimate friend Cyril
Scott, and he helped to bring the works
of Debussy and Maurice Ravel forward
in England and America. Here again in
each case it was the new viewpoint; the
original mind that claimed his champion-
ship. Throughout his long concert career
Grainger has been sedulously seeking
merit in the new as well as in the old,
and since he took up his residence in
the U.S.A. he has been the prophet and

advocate of a round dozen of contem-
porary English and American composers
whose claims otherwise might not have
received the attention they merit.
And, almost alone among living vir-
tuosos, Grainger has never accepted the
pianoforte as perfect. He has experi-
mented with the pedal pianoforte (addi-
tional bass notes, foot-operated) and with
the quarter-note instrument —this last he
believes destined to open up whole new
worlds of harmony. For many years,
too, he has interested himself in orches-
tration, and on his present Australian
tour he is introducing new and strange
flavors to the orchestral stewpot.
Unlike other virtuosos, Grainger talks
at his recitals. Pachmann used to

roof of the building.
talk (usually while he was playing),
but that was put down either to
showmanship or the irrepressible gar-
rulity of age. Grainger usually has some-
thing to say about the purport and in-
spiration of what he is about to play;
about the effects which the composer
intended to produce, and he then sits
down and produces them. It is a bold
and fearless man who will do that. The
average virtuoso (the writer has ques-
tioned at least 20 of them) has generally
only the haziest of notions concerning
the meaning of the notes he plays; in-
deed considers himself at liberty to give
them any meaning he pleases and to play
them accordingly. Grainger spares no
pains to get under the composer’s skin,
and in the case of most of the living
composers whose works he plays, and of
Grieg, he has his interpretation direct
from the man who wrote the music.
Music plays so large a part in Grain-
ger’s life, and he gets so much joy out
of it, that he finds it hard to realise why
anyone should forego the pleasure of
making music for themselves. The Aus-
tralians, he perceives, have a taste for
music very like his own —he has outlined
its characteristics in a foreword to his
“Colonial Song”—and he sees no reason
why they shouldn’t get as much fun out
of music as out of cricket. “It is all
right to have some professionals playing
especially well,” he said recently, “but if
we are to have healthy conditions we must
have the bulk of the people playing for
themselves.” He doesn’t agree with those
who think that the gramophone, the
radio and the player-piano must stultify
the music-making desire. He thinks they
stimulate it. It would be nice to think
so, but for ten years it has become in-
creasingly difficult to purchase in Aus-
tralia any music above the intellectual
level of the latest Tinpan Alley song-hit,
and most of the shops that used to sell
real music now seem to find more profit
in flat-irons and refrigerators. However,
that only stresses our need for musical
missionaries.
A. D. W.
Country Short-wave Explorations.
There are several changes to record
since last week’s notes were written.
Chief of these is the gradual change
showing in the 8.8. C. transmissions
for Australia. After 6 p.m. GSB (31.5)
weakens rapialy, while GSD (25.5) im-
proves, and is quite good strength until
closing down at 7.15. Another difference
is the return of PHI to the 25m. band,
using the same times of transmission
(11.30 p.m. to 1.30 a.m.), with an extra
half-hour on Saturday and Sunday. The
days without transmissions are Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday. The an-
nouncer of the many languages and
cheery quips is absent. Practically no
announcements are made in English, and
during the whole of one session not a
word was spoken in English.
With the exception of RNE, which has
weakened, all the 25m. stations have
been excellent after 11 p.m., but still
weak after 6 a.m. DJA has been putting
out some filhe transmissions, with music
well worth listening to.
A station on 31.4 m. (between DJA
and W2XAF) has been coming on at
the same time as DJA. No call-book
shows a station at this frequency, and
so far signals have not been strong
enough to enable
the language to be
identified. Music
and long talks
come from this
source. There is
also a station
(about 25.4) aud-
ible as early as
9.30 p.m. This is
2RO’s frequency,
but it is an hour
at which the old
station never trans-
mitted, and at the
time 2RO was usu-
ally heard there is
no sign of any car-
rier. The strength
is not sufficient to
enable one to iden-
tify the language,
and, as on the
several occasions
on which 2RO
made test an-
nouncements there was no trouble in
following its Italian, it seems doubtful
if this is 2RO.
CTIAA (31.17) has been very clear
between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m., and SUV
(29.3) has also been heard about the
same hour. W2XAF was heard testing
with VK2ME with all the old-time
strength. The 80m. amateur band has
been practically useless owing to static,
which also spoilt RVIS.
In a recent issue it was mentioned
that a Sydney amateur ’phone was heard
on 20m. This should have been 40.
Owing to skip it is very rare indeed that
VK2 stations are heard here in the 20m.
band.
On a recent morning GSMB was
heard calling The Bulletin’s Radio
Editor (VK2NO) vigorously in the 40m.
band.
NIGTOWL.
Ohm’s Law in a Nutshell.
The three most important factors to
be considered in the design of radio re-
ceivers, amplifiers and transmitters are
capacity, inductance and resistance.
Each of these is of equal importance, and
all are dependent on each other. Resist-
ance is perhaps the easiest of these
factors to understand, and as radio sets
fairly bristle with resistances of all shapes
and sizes anyone desirous of becoming
proficient in radio theory must be con-
versant with Ohm’s Law.
This law states that the flow of electri-
cal current increases with the increase of
electromotive force (voltage) and de-
creases with increased resistance. Many
amateurs, nowever, soon forget this law,
and find it necessary to look it up in a
reference-book. Having found it, the
formula for the particular factor required
may have to be worked out from the
data given. This takes time, and the
margin of error is greater.
A much simpler, rapid and more accu-
rate method, both for the amateur and
the professional, is by the use of the
“nutshells.” Here the factors are en-
closed in circles, and the symbols used
are as follows:
E = Electromotive force in volts.
C = Current in amperes.
R = Resistance in ohms.
W = Power in watts.
The formulas of Ohm’s Law are indi-
cated at a glance:
F E
R=—C- E C X R
C R
Just by placing a finger on the particu-
lar factor it is required to know, we see
the relative position of the other two
factors in that “nutshell,” and can work
out the answer if the values of these two
factors are known. For instance, if we
want to find the resistance, we place
a finger on R, and we see that E divided
by C will be the formula required.
The other two circles contain formulae
for calculating the power consumed by
resistances.
Since the currents used in radio are
usually expressed in milliamperes, it must
be remembered that C is the current in
amperes and that a milliamp. is one-
thousandth of an ampere.
This method is much quicker and
easier than trying to remember for-
mulae.
RADIOZ.
Transmitter Technique.
An Electron-coupled Frequency Doubler.
The circuit diagram illustrated indi-
cates the use of a radio frequency pen-
tode in a novel manner, and the idea is
worthy of trial. The control grid and
auxiliary grid are used in conjunction
with Ll-Cl as the frequency controlling
circuit, and the plate as the frequency
doubling output. A metal screen is used
between the two tuned circuits, and the
originator claims excellent results at
14mc., using a 7mc. control circuit. No
neutralisation is necessary, and such
valves as the 47, and for medium power
Philips F 443, are applicable. For higher
power the new Raytheon RK-20 R.F.
pentode would be suitable.

Wave-change Switch from Old
Rheostat.
“Enno”: A variation on the single-
pole multi-point switch suggested by
“E.M.” (B. 25/7/’34) is illustrated. This
type of switch is useful for short-circuit-
ing the sections of a tapped coil, and,
applied to short-wave coverage, provides
a form of wave-change. The discarded
rheostat is again the foundation, the
resistance wire being removed from the
strip, and slots cut to hold taps made
from 14-gauge wire securely in posi-
tion. The narrow contact arm is replaced
by a wide plate, and by connecting the
shaft to earth the various sections of a
tapped coil may be short-circuited.
What’s What in Radio.
With the advent of the summer sea-
son and the finish of the 1934 cricket
Tests, many radio retailers around the
Sydney trade are bemoaning a sudden
“flop” in business. Others report that,
though business has fallen off, it is still
satisfactory. Those who are able to view
matters cheerfully are consistent adver-
tisers of the right kind of goods. The
black cloud of a dead summer radio sea-
son in Australia should not be permitted
to loom over the horizon, for radio to-day
is no luxury; it is a national necessity.
The all-wave receiver should provide
much interest, overseas short-wave recep-
tion being invariably better during the
summer months.
* * * jj!
Judging by the results obtained over-
seas, the 12 months’ 10-metre test organ-
ised by the Radio Society of Great Bri-
tain should bear fruit in long-distance
working during some part of the period.
Transatlantic signals have recently been
heard in England, and almost wide-world
communication was possible in 1928 and
1929. If the 11-year-cycle theory works
according to plan, long-distance 10-
metre communication should be possible
again in the Australian winter months
of 1935.

Illustrations of the latest receivers pro-
duced in England reveal some striking
designs in cabinet-work, to say nothing
of the actual structural design of the re-
ceiver chassis. Most unusual are the
EKCO Co.’s receivers, turned out with
a huge semicircular dial almost as large
as the receiver cabinet itself. There is
no doubt about being able to see the
dial reading. Although extremely futur-
istic in effect, most of the latest English
receivers are fine examples of beautiful
cabinet-work.

Dr. Robinson, inventor of the Sten-
ode-type of superhet wherein ultra-
selectivity is obtainable, states that when
the Stenode was introduced he had in
mind the solution of one of the out-
standing problems of radio: the multi-
plication of stations on the air. This
problem is even more prominent to-day,
as there is no room left in the useful
long-distance part of the ether for the
new art of television. The public will
never be satisfied with the present ideas
of using television only for local broad-
casting, which will be the result of re-
stricting it to waves of the order of five
or six metres. It is essential to accom-
modate it on waves with long-distance
carrying capacity; that is, on waves
longer than about 10 metres.
Casual Comment.
In the midst of much talk about high-
fidelity receivers on the Australian mar-
ket in the near future a prominent manu-
facturer returns from a visit to U.S.A.
with a damper on the enthusiasm. Al-
though he considers that eventually such
receivers will be the last word in repro-
duction in the really faithful sense, it is
a case of listening to such a receiver for
quite a time before one gets used to it.
Another big objection will be the price.
After radio manufacturers all over the
world have cheapened production to
such an extent that the purchase price
of to-day is only a fraction of that of six
or seven years ago it will be hard to con-
vince the public that it should buy more
expensive receivers. The high-fidelity
campaign seems to be a swing back to
push-pull audio amplification with audio
transformers capable of doing a first-
class job. Such transformers have been on
the market for a long time, but, being
an expensive overseas product, have been
little used for years. When they were
cheaper valves weren’t what they are
now. There are, however, some excellent
systems of audio amplification, such as
the two-stage paraphrase resistance
coupling, and Australian manufacturers
are getting busy on some really good
push-pull transformers.

An English radio journal, touching
upon the superhet versus tuned R.F.
question, says that whereas the latter is
less susceptible to extraneous noise it
relies upon the use of reaction for its
distance-getting qualities. While this may
be so in the case of the R.F. detector
and one audio arrangement it does not
apply in the case of a tuned R.F. receiver
with three, or even two, tuned R.F.
amplifiers ahead of the detector. Ameri-
can engineers produced such receivers
in quantity prior to the superhet era, and
a regeneration control was unknown and
entirely unnecessary. Three stages of

Excitement was rife in the early morn-
ing of the day after Scott won the air
race when the Netherlands ’plane piloted
by Parmentier and Moll ran into elec-
trical storms on the border of N.S.W.-
Vic. on the last stage of its magnificent
ferry trip. Hunting around in darkness
and storm, diminishing petrol suonly
necessitated putting the massive machine
down. A.B.C. stations played a promi-
nent part, frequent calls and instruc-
tions being given by the announcer of
3AR, also through 2CO Corowa. Par-
mentier’s landing on Albury racecourse,
soggy with rain, was an example of
superb piloting, and within half an hour
one of the passengers, Mr. Gilissen, was
before 2CO’s microphone, telling a much
relieved Australian broadcast public of
what appeared to be just a sample day’s
work for K.L.M.’s crack night-flying
pilot. The frequent announcements from
the 2CO transmitter must have put a
very strong signal into the ’plane’s re-
ceiver, and as this station spoke through-
out the evening as “3AR Melbourne,”
and not until later as “2CO Corowa,”
the radio operator on the ’plane must
have thought Melbourne was somewhere
pretty close.

“T.L.”: Probably many readers have
tried “S.G.’s” crystal set (B. 26/9/’34),
and no doubt many are astonished at the
performance possible by such an arrange-
ment. Many will desire nothing better, and
others will regard it as a mere begin-
ning. Crystal-detector cranks are recom-
mended to study a few of the text-
books written in the earlier days of radio,
and bearing such names as Eckersley
and Scot-Taggart. Crystal sets described
therein were evolved long before the
valve was in the limelight, when non-
amplifying detectors had to make the
most of weak distant signals. With an
efficient aerial some of these crystal
arrangements had the sensitivity, and
even the selectivity, of an R.F. and de-
tector outfit using modern high-loss
coils. Writer endorses this Page’s plea
for iron-dust core coils in Australia.

Wide-World Four Results.
W. B. L. Madang, New Guinea, says
of the Wide-World Four (described B.
18/7/’34): The receiver is going very
well, and on board the Macdhui, with a
poor aerial and a cabin like a steel cage,
broadcasting came in in a most remark-
able manner. I could not tune in the
Melbourne stations comfortably at 1500
miles, as they were too strong and
would “blow your head off” even with-
out an earth. The speaker quality is
excellent, and seems to deal with any
amount of volume.

Can you supply a circuit with necessary
details of a filter for reducing the needle hiss
from an electrical pick-up ? —l6l.
The diagram shows the essentials. Lis a
radio-frequency choke with an inductance
value between 70 and 80 millihenries. Con-
denser C will have a capacity between .002
mid. and .003 mfd., depending upon the actual
value of inductance L. Resistance R will
be between 20,000 and 50,000 ohms. These
variations are within limits for matching to
different types of pick-ups.
I wish to add to or alter, whichever is the
easier, a Lucas 12-volt dynamotor so that it
will start charging at 500 r.p.m. instead of
1500 r.p.m. Can this be done easily ? —l6O.
The job calls for complete rewinding, and
your best plan is to put it in the hands of
a competent radio engineer. Try Don Electric

/ have recently entered amateur radio ranks,
and am very keen on ultra-high-frequency ex-
periments. Several descriptions of five-metre
receivers are to hand, but 1 would like some-
thing with an R.F. stage ahead of the super-
regenerator. Please oblige with a
circuit diagram of such a receiver. —
158.
The diagram illustrated is repro-
duced from “Radio” (U.S.A.) for
September. This receiver has an un-
tuned stage of R.F., but its value
other than that of an aerial coupling
device is limited in comparison with
the functioning of the R.F. stage
in a receiver tuning to lower fre-
quencies. Constants are as follows:
Coupling condenser Cl is a small
variable from 5 to 35 mmfd.; C 2, 5 mfd.; C 3,
.006 mfd. LI and other R.F. chokes are iden-
tical. They are made on a jin. dowel, and have
50 turns of 28 D.S.C. wire, close wound. L 2
takes six turns of 14 enamelled wire on core jin.
diameter, spaced the diameter of the wire.
A tap is taken on L 2 at two turns from the
bottom (plate side connected to 27 valve). As
this is an A.C. receiver the 2500-ohm dynamic
speaker field is used as an extra choke. It
can be the first or second choke in the filter.
Plate voltages are: 250 volts maximum, 120
volts to primary of audio transformer and
’phones and 90 volts to screen of 58 R.F. valve.
(1) In the short-wave converter No. 1 ( B.
1/ 8 / ’34), could grid-leak detection be used on
the first detector and still feed the oscillator
via the suppressor grid ? If so, would .0001-
mfd. condenser and \-meg. leak suit ? (2)
Am using about 200 volts on the plate of first
detector. What screen voltage is maximum as
(a) anode bend, and as (b) leaky grid detec-
tor ? (3) Can the A-mfd. by-pass from the
plate of the oscillator be a Chanex tubular ?
—159.
(1) Yes. Use ,0001-mfd. condenser and
2-meg. grid leak. (2) About 90 volts on the
screen for anode bend and 45 volts for leaky
grid. (3) Yes, this type of condenser was
specified in the article.
In the portable signal generator (B. 12/9/’34),
should the coil have 270 turns or 370 turns ?
The centre-tap is mentioned as being at the
185 th turn. —163.
Three hundred and seventy turns is correct.
/ propose building the Quality Superhet, de-
scribed in “Australian Radio News” some
months ago. A Sterling A.F. transformer is on
hand. This is heavily made, primary to second-
ary ratio of 1 to 6, windings of the pie form.
It is proposed to solder a connection at the
junction of the two centre secondary pies, thus-
providing a centre-tap. Do you consider this
will be sufficiently accurate ? —164.
You can do no harm anyway by trying the
tap, and it should be sufficiently accurate. To
obtain a better balance, you can connect two
resistances, about 100,000 ohms each, between
the outsides and the new centre-tap. The effec-
tive amplification ratio will be reduced, but
should still be sufficient for the purpose.

Use of Pigeons in Aviation
Another passenger ’plane down —

Should not “homers” be carried on

suitable crate might be designed, one
that would collapse and liberate the birds
—three, I suggest. A trained pigeon of
the right type and temperament will
“home” from any distance up to 500
miles at express-train speed (hawks are
the only danger). They could not avert
tragedies like those of the Southern
Cloud and the Miss Hobart, though they
might clear up such mysteries ; but in
case of a forced landing with the
wireless out of order a pigeon carrying
a message would be invaluable. A mes-
sageless bird would presage news of dis-
aster. The lives of Hitchcock and Ander-
son might have been thus saved. Ready
assistance would be forthcoming from
the many pigeon-racing clubs in Aus-
tralia. — Nowra Bill (N.S.W.).
Douglas Credit
It has been asserted in Maoriland that
the London Chamber of Commerce had
taken a vote and approved of Douglas
Credit by a large majority. I doubted
this, so I wrote to the secretary. His
reply is dated Sept. 6, and reads:
In reply to your letter of July 27, I have
pleasure in stating that the London
Chamber has never considered the Douglas
Credit proposals, and has, therefore, never
expressed any views upon them.
I think the information should be
passed on to show that this most influ-
ential body of businessmen does not
consider the subject worth discussing.—

After Sol’s Own Heart
The Queensland Government some-
times proves a kindly cow to milk.
Blank deserted his wife. He “married”
again, but continued secretly to main-
tain wife No. 1. Everything went
well until Blank lost his job. The
first Mrs. Blank summoned him for
maintenance. This led to a charge of
bigamy, and he was released on his own
bond. He continued to live with and
support the second lady, and was eventu-
ally forced to take on relief work. Now,
apart from the allowance to which he is
himself entitled, a sympathetic depart-
ment has approved of the payment of
additional amounts in respect of each of
his wives and families. King Solomon
would have liked the Queensland Gov-
ernment. — Questo (Q.).
“A Complete Vindication”
“Live and let live” is no motto of
the N.S.W. Railway Department. While
Melbourne was riding in furniture vans,
and glad to have the use of them till
the trammies went back to their job, the
department came out with a paragraph
gloating over its success in competing
with furniture-shifters who are savagely
taxed:—•
During the year 1625 removals were
undertaken for a return of £20,000. A
complete vindication of the efficiency of the
service, and refutation of the unwarranted
statements of the Motor-van Owners’
Association.
The profit on this very questionable
traffic is not given. Neither is it stated
how much was lost in rates and taxes
formerly paid. The department pays no
taxes, and admits a loss for the year of
£2,632,500, which is a ridiculous under-
statement. —D. E. (N.S.W.).
“Knocking the Copper”
It is an old sport, but in one State it
is grossly overdone. In N. S. Wales last
year just over 3600 persons were con-
victed of “offences against the person,”
from murder down. Just over 300 —one
in twelve —were charged with assaulting
the police.
There are 3600 men in the N. S. Wales
police, and as a large proportion of them
is on inside duty it is fairly safe to say
that one in every seven on beat is
attacked during the year. The enormity
of the number of convictions can only
be gauged by reference to other States.
Crimes against the police alone in N. S.
Wales are only 200 short of the normal
number of all offences against the person
in Queensland; they are equal to a
fourth of the total personal crimes and
misdemeanors in Victoria ; they number
108 more than the annual all-in figure
for all classes in S.A. and are a little Jess
than the number of general personal
offences in W.A. Even allowing that
N. S. Wales heads the list of convictions
for crimes of all sorts —having more than
twice the number registered in Victoria,
which has a population only 800,000 less
—this is too much.
“Like many men, you have an in-
grained grudge against the police,” said
McMahon, S.M., of Sydney, sentencing
a ruffian to a month and a £2 fine
for having twice attacked a constable
“Cripes, we’ve come six miles, and we’ve still got seven to go!”
“That settles it. I’m goin’ back. It’s shorter.”
who was taking four men to the lock-up,
and having incited the captives to resist
arrest.
This sort of thing is not to be stopped
by such sentences. —E. H. M. (N.S.W.).
Missions in New Guinea
Last year an expedition led by a Gov-
ernment patrol officer discovered good
country in Mandated New Guinea be-
tween the Markheim River and Mount
Hagen. “Somewhere about 300,000 sq.
miles in area, well watered and much of
it open and undulating,” it is peopled
by races of higher intelligence than
most Papuans ; they have neat villages,
farms, roads enclosed in planted lines
of trees and artificial lawns.
Immediately the discovery was an-
nounced prospectors began to move a
little further inland, and there were some
deaths on the border. Considerably
more natives were killed than whites —
it always happens. The price of Empire
having been paid in blood, the way was
open for the next wave of civilisation.
Now three denominations have made
their plans to wean the heathen from
their tree-planting and teach them the
shorter catechism and the use of a mis-
sion broom. And a Government anthro-
pologist has lectured to the Melanesian
Mission, which has decided to get in
on a good thing at once.
The Government, of course, must
admit missionaries to the Territory
under the peace treaty ; but it can direct
their movements, and it should certainly
regulate the scramble that is beginning.
Missions, as a general rule, are highly
commercialised ventures in the tropics.
When they settle down in remote out-
lands they become virtually the Gov-
ernment, with a monopoly of commerce.
When they are able to tell the simple
savage that they have full religious
control of their own races, it will be
time enough to allow more of them to
invade pristine territories and begin
shoving trousers on free natives who
don’t wish to wear them, — Kaloa (N.G.).
Bother the Grasshoppers!
The parts of N. S. Wales and Queens-
land menaced and invaded by grass-
hoppers are equal in size to the British
Isles. They may be stripped as bare of
crop and pasture as an asphalt school-
yard. But there are few signs of con-
cern, much less activity.
I have met graziers from stricken areas.
The only people they have been co-
operating with have been certain gentle-
men at Randwick and in s.p. shops.
Governments, too, cannot be over-
worried about' trifles like this. The
Forgan Smith Government in Queens-
land is window-dressing in industrial
constituencies for the next election,
and the Stevens Ministry is push-
ing forward with its plan for building
more homes in suburbs where there
are hundreds of vacant houses. It seems
a pity to me sometimes that locusts are
never seen in parks. If a flock of them
chewed the Botanic Gardens in Brisbane
or Sydney and the suburban grassplots
bare as I have seen them denude the
farms of Syria and Irak, public opinion
which counts would take its mind off
cricketers and stunt fliers and make such
a fierce demand for action that dead
insects would cumber the earth feet high
and miles wide. — Beyrout (N.S.W.).
Ethnologists and the Abo.
I’m sure “Yeni-Punyamai” has not met
some of our modern ethnologists ; if he
had he wouldn’t have made such slight-
ing references to their relations with the
tribes they study (B. 17/10/”34). Take
Norman Tindale, ethnologist at the S.A.
Museum. Tindale fitted himself for his
job by a long course of study ; then he
chartered a lugger, and was left at Groote
Eylandt for 15 months, living alone with
abos. who were quite unspoilt. They hid
nothing whatever from him and the fruits
of that stay have made Tindale a recog-
nised authority on the abo. He has had
no trouble in gaining or in retaining their
confidence. The language difficulty
doesn’t worry him, for he is a born lin-
guist ; when Japanesewarships last
visited S.A. he was the only man in
Adelaide who could converse with the
visitors in their own language.
A man with similar work to his credit
is Donald Thomson, of Melbourne. Re-
marks like those of “Yeni-Punyamai”
are very unfair to these competent young-
sters, who are carrying on the work of
Spencer and Gillen, — Larrapinta (S.A,).
Private and Government ’Phones
I had occasion to ring up San E)iego
from San Francisco; a three-minute
conversation at 10 p.m. The ’phone
charge was 17s. 6d. At Newcastle a
year or two later I had a three-minute
talk with Melbourne, same distance, after
10 p.m. I paid 2s. 9d. One for Gov-
ernment control; but there is another
side. The Yankee ’phone co. has more
sense than to give its automatic ex-
changes letters with the same vowel
sounds. How many Australians asking
for F-double-owe have been switched on
to M-double-owe! In America, the first
two letters of the name of the exchange
have to be dialled. You don’t have to
memorise algebraical symbols. If you
want Manly you dial MA and the num-
ber. It doesn’t require much ingenuity
to name the exchanges so that there is
no duplication of initial letters. —G.M.
(Vic.).
For Child Endowment
Archbishop Duhig, by stressing 'the
importance of child endowment, directed
attention to a glaring anomaly in social
legislation, due to the States having
powers which should properly be vested
in the Commonwealth. Child endow-
ment has been law in N. S. Wales for
years, and, in spite of financial chaos
and the tendency to take from those
least able to protect themselves, no poli-
tician has yet had the temerity to sug-
gest wiping it' out. Yet other States, in
precisely the same position, hang be-
hind in this very necessary provision—
necessary in meting out fair play to the
citizens and doubly necessary in adding
the best possible immigrants to the
State’s assets.
Take the case of the Melbourne tram-
waymen who have just had a strike. A
single man receiving the £3 18s. a week
paid to the trammies can get along, not
luxuriously, but with moderate comfort.
His married fellow-worker who has,
say, three kiddies lives in an atmosphere
of penury and terror, and the youngsters
are denied many things available freely
to youngsters in Government institutions.
The community which treats its children
who are lucky enough to be with their
parents worse than it treats the
children who have been flung
on its hands deserves all it may
get when those children grow
up.— Fez, Plees (Vic.).
The Big Union
Preference to the A.W.U. is
the policy of our present Gov-
ernment. It is a gross injustice
to the workseeker, and it means
that men are being conscripted
into the organisation in glaring
inconsistency with A.W.U. policy
in 1916-17. A man may hump
his swag over the State for the
greater part of the year ; should
he ultimately obtain a week’s
work he is pounced upon by an
A.W.U. organiser or shed rep.
and forced to take out a mem-
bership ticket for 255. or go ■.• on
the track again. This 255., plus
tax, leaves him very little after
his week’s work. The A.W.U.
has not only lost its popularity
in Queensland, but 80 per cent,
of pastoral workers are openly
hostile to it. — Duke Meredith
(Q-).
Work for the Young
This problem of giving the youngsters
an opportunity must be faced. A start
can be made by compulsorily retiring all
over 65 years, beginning with the Gov-
ernor-General. A man who deserves
well of his country, it is true ; but he
will show himself worthier still if he
gives a lead and publicly states his
reason.
The Old Men have had their innings,
and national interests demand that youth
have a chance with the bat. The Old
Men have been running the game since
the war. They have mortgaged the
country and landed it in this mess. One
may concede that their difficulties were
great; at all events, they failed, and must'
stand down. And, temporarily, at any
rate, one old ’un out at the top will often
let two young ’uns in at the bottom.
Married women must be compelled to
vacate positions. These are not the
times to allow them a second string. Any-
way, a married woman has entered into
a contract which the vast majority of
her sex regard as an undertaking to make
a house into a home for her mate. As
for the mate, his sex is almost to a man
against the married-woman worker. A
duty is cast upon parents to make them-
selves heard on this question. It is
above all parties, and no politician
should be considered for one moment
who is above the age or does not pledge
himself definitely to legislative action.—
Outski (Q.).


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Sydney-trained horses continue to show
their superiority in Melbourne. Results
in 1933 were far different, visiting candi-
dates being overshadowed. The Guineas
went to Palphar, the Caulfield Cup to
Gaine Carrington, the Moonee Valley
Cup to Peter Jackson, the Derby and
Melbourne Cup to Hall Mark and the
Williamstown Cup to Shadow King—all
from the home ranks.
More importance attached to the
W. S. Cox Plate than to any other event
at Moonee Valley. The Cup did not
attract a high-class field, and Nightly
was able to win at his ease with 9st. 21b.;
but ihe Plate, run at standard weight-
for-age, enabled Hall Mark, Chatham
and Rogilla to fight their Caulfield Stakes
battle over again. Form of the Aus-
tralian equine stars has been rather topsy-
turvy this spring. Sydney contests left
it doubtful whether Peter Pan, Chatham
or Rogilla could be dubbed champion up
to a middle distance. The issue was
further complicated by Chatham losing
to Hall Mark in the Caulfield Stakes, and
it has not been entirely clarified through
A. E. Blair’s stallion turning the tables
on Hall Mark at the Valley. The going
was on the heavy side: Chatham likes it
that way ; Hall Mark doesn’t.

Chatham obtained an advantage at the
start, and the jockey, Davidson, made
full use of this, being two lengths clear
of any rival and five lengths in advance
of Hall Mark at the first turn. Hall
Mark was no worse off in this respect
than he had been at Caulfield, but suf-
fered by being compelled to make his
own pace from the six-furlong post when
asked to chase Chatham in earnest.
Darby Munro had unwittingly done
Dempsey a good turn in the Caulfield
Stakes by making Rogilla extend
Chatham for the greater part of the
journey; this gave Hall Mark the last
run. Davidson took care not to be out-
generalled at the Valley. Just when Hall
Mark was beginning to draw on the
leader, between the half-mile and three-
furlong posts, Davidson asked Chatham
for a special effort, and the brilliant bay
swept farther away from his pursuers.
Hall Mark never got within striking dis-
tance, and was beaten by 2} lengths,
Chatham easing up over the last 50
yards.
The most remarkable feature of the
race was Rogilla’s achievement in finish-
ing only half a length behind Chatham,
after losing lengths by swerving round
when the barrier lifted. In 1933 Chat-
ham started at 15 to 8 on in the W. S.
Cox Plate and missed a place. Rogilla
came from the rear of the field on that
occasion to vanquish Dermid and Waltz-
ing Lily. Everything considered, his
feat on Saturday was even more meri-
torious. Melburnians are satisfied that
the Caulfield Stakes form of Rogilla did
not do him justice.
Conscious of the superior calibre of
his mount, Maurice McCarten was able
to handle Nightly with great confidence
in the Gold Cup. He employed the
great speed of the Maorilander to move
across from an outside berth to the rails
inside a furlong. From that stage every-
thing was merry and bright for McCar-
ten. He never left the rails, and, by keep-
ing close to the pacemakers, avoided any
risk of being pocketed. Without sem-
blance of effort, Nightly worked his way
to the front at the turn into the straight.
For a moment Miramond looked dan-
gerous, but he lugged out under' pres-
sure, and Nightly justified the confidence
of those who accepted 6 to 4 about his
chance (5 to 2 had been laid) by draw-
ing away for a two-lengths victory.
Upoko Ariki was only a neck behind
Miramond.
The placed horses were bred in Maori-
land and ridden by Sydney jockeys. In-
clusive of a £2OO trophy, first prize in
the Cup was £2700. Before the race the
stewards ordered the owner of Nightly
to pay a losing or winning fee to Roy
Reed, who produced a letter from the
horse’s trainer, F. D. Jones, engaging
him to ride Nightly in all Australian
races during the spring.
Ike Foulsham won the juvenile race
for colts and geldings with Strathardle
(Rampion—Pet Symington), whom he
purchased as a yearling for 275gns. on
behalf of L. K. S. Mackinnon, the
V.R.C. chairman. Divisions of the
event for two-year-old fillies were an-
nexed by Venosa and Theresa Gamba
respectively. These two youngsters were
sired by Manfred, who needed a stud
advertisement. Venosa is trained by D.
J. Price, whose Moonee Valley Cup can-
didate, Streperus, died from internal
haemorrhage after returning to the weigh-
ing enclosure. Theresa Gamba ran away
with her race, and is one of the speedi-
est fillies seen out this season.
* =;s *
Kensington meeting attracted one of the
best crowds seen at that Sydney course for
many years. Again bookmakers scored ;
but a few were caught in the Kensington
Handicap, wherein the jumper Clangor,
backed from 20 to 1 to tens, won all the
way. At one stage he had a lead of
about 15 lengths. Wallace Mimi went
after the chestnut, but got tired chasing
him.
Cuban Song, a fine type of mare from
the Northern Rivers by Arachne’s sire
Corban, was supported from fours to
6 to 4 in the first heat of the Flying
Handicap. She let her party down badly.
William Kelso’s Rossendale filly Mis-
nomer (7 to 1), favored by her light
weight, beat Headmaster and Prince
Pombal comfortably. She was ridden by
Murphy, as also was Clangor. The
Dominion-owned Norman Conquest (12
to 1), a big, powerful fellow, made hacks
of the opposition in the second division ;
the favorite, Questionnaire, was second
and Silverline third.
Fernclove (5 to 1) won the Welter
Mile well, and is sure to repeat the per-
formance presently. He put in a long
run from the half-mile, and was going
right away in the straight from Babili
and King Moab. Good form was also
shown by Dutch Courage (evens), carry-
ing the Gloaming colors, in the Three-
year Handicap. She is trained by George
Young, who used to ride Gloaming.

“Thirsk”: Blandford, by Swynford
from Blanche, by White Eagle, has for
some years been the most successful of
English sires—Windsor Lad, winner of
Derby and Leger, was one of his cham-
pions this season. Not a great performer
on the track, though he showed him-
self a notable stayer, a quality he trans-
mits to all his progeny, the youngster
went early to the stud, and in 1924 was
taken to Ireland. Later, when heavy
duties were imposed by England on
blood stock from Ireland, Blandford
came back to England, where his fee to-
day is 400 guineas. Since 1927 his stock
have won £lBB,OOO in round numbers,
this season’s tally to time of writing
being £61,326. Before the season ends
Blandford should easily top the record
of old Stockwell, which has stood since
1866, when his 39 winners collected
£61,391.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Dead in Perth, Peter Lester, a veteran
sporting journalist who wrote a great
deal for Perth and Kalgoorlie Sunday
papers, the Westralian “Worker” and the
“Referee.” Peter was a racy reporter
of boxing, and could give his stuff a
humorous twist. He tickled all Westralia
with a brisk account of how Tommy
Burns, on his way from London to Sydney
to fight Johnson, had his leg pulled at
Perth. Having prepared the way with wel-
coming cablegrams and newspaper adver-
tisements, a boxer and a promoter bore
down on Tommy at the steamer, carried
him up to the city in a car, and, before
he quite knew where he was, had him
refereeing a match between the pug.
and a pupil, specially arranged as Wes-
tralia’s Grand Popular Welcome to the
Champion; 55., 3s. and 2s. The ordeal
over, they solemnly presented him with
a 3s. 6d. cane, engraved at vast expense:
another eighteenpence, at least. Tommy
left the building—a converted vegetable-
market —in a daze.

Though Ali Bey is really no “Terrible
Turk,” he wrestled well enough against
Wong Bock Cheung at Sydney Stadium
to convince most of the 2000 spectators
that he would give Sonnenberg an argu-
ment. With a series of slams he sent
the Chinaman to sleep in the fifth round.
Bock did not answer the bell. Sam Bur-
meister and Tom Lurich performed
again at Leichhardt. Their entertainment
was called a draw.
The Nineteenth Hole
The first golf match between England
and Australia began with the singles on
Saturday at the Australian club’s course
at Kensington (N.S.W.). Each side won
two matches, McKay downing Scott 2 and
1, while McLean abolished Jim Ferrier
by 5 and 4. Ryan, of Victoria, levelled
matters by finishing one up on Bourn,
but Garnett had no trouble in disposing
of Eric Apperly, 5 and 4. The four-
somes, over 36 holes, were played on
Monday. At the end of 18 holes Scott
and Garnett were 5 up on Ferrier and
McKay, while Apperly and Ryan were
2 up on Bourn and McLean.

“Hutt”: A. J. Shaw (B. 17/10/’34)
added the professional championship of
M.L. to his long record after taking the
open. As a golfer, he stands by himself
in M.L., and he is to come along and see
what he can do in the big events at the
Melbourne centenary tourney. Some
years ago Shaw tried his luck at the Aus-
tralian championships—in Adelaide, I
think —but could strike no form at all.
Three M.L. mates, Watt, Douglas and
Lambie —all Scots names, please note —
will chase the centenary siller with him.

“Blue Hills”: There must be some-
thing in Canberra air to fatten up young
golfers. Lou Kelly learned his game
at the Federal capital, and was a potential
champion when barely out of short
pants. Now J. A. Bull, a 17-year-old
lad, and the youngest player in Royal
Canberra, has taken the club champion-
ship, beating the titleholder, J. K.
Williams.

Ins and' Outs
“Lancaster Park”: Maoriland C.A.,
having had its request for a visit from
an Aussie side turned down, as far as
this season is concerned, is trying pri-
vate enterprise. Wanganui, Auckland
and Wellington— nowt to do with the
N.Z.C.A. —are to send delegates to the
B. of C. to put the case for a visit. If
the delegates were allowed to do the
selecting themselves, free from the B. of
C. meddling, a very successful result
might be reached. Leaving the Methu-
selahs of the game to toddle about in the
Sheffields, a team of hefty youngsters
might be shipped across on a guar-
antee of safe return. In M.L. they would
get a chance of playing on pitches which

“Gabba”: That alleged abo. tornado
Gilbert is to be given another trial by
the Q.C.A. At one time it was hoped
that he would witch the world with gory
bodyline and effectively dispose of Jar-
dine, Larwood and co. However, an
accident and an outbreak of leprosy at
his abo. station cut him out of the game
for a couple of seasons. The spell is
said to have improved him greatly, and
he is to play in Country Week.

As expected, Walter Lindrum retained
the world’s billiard championship by
beating Davis in the final heat of the
tourney in Melbourne by 875 points:
23,553 to 22,678. Lindrum made a
world’s record under baulk-line rules —
1475, in 63min. 50sec. Not only
the championship but the British Bil-
liards Cup remains in Australia, and
those seeking them will have to come
here.

The Centenary Thousand cycle race over
1100 miles of the roughest country in Vic-
toria was an ordeal to all concerned
owing to the weather, which was vile.
Riders like Opperman and others with
Tour de France experience retired ex-
hausted before the finish, some of them
painfully injured through falls. H.
Cruise, of Melbourne, won the first prize
of £5OO and other prizes. F. Stuben-
rauch, another Victorian, won the handi-
cap, worth £5OO, in addition to pickings
for stage wins.

Under the Whip
Until convinced of the contrary —as,
of course, it may be—this Page will re-
main of the opinion that Theo is not the
three-year-old he is cracked up to be.
He doesn’t look a first-class horse, and
his victories—only three so far —have
been over horses of his own age. His
Guineas success looks good on paper,
but it was accomplished in surprisingly
slow time (lmin. 404 sec.), and often the
colt that was to prove himself the best
of the year has been beaten in the
Guineas.
Farndale, on the other hand, has raced
very creditably against older horses. His
close second in the Caulfield Cup was a
very meritorious performance; with a
little less anxiety on the part of the
jockey he might have been first. Hy-
perion, Aztec and Gladswood may help
to make a race of it; the last-named
may always be seen to better advantage
in Melbourne than in Sydney.
Windbag and Nightmarch won the
Melbourne Cup as four-year-olds with
9st. 21b. Why shouldn’t Hall Mark Win
with the same weight? Though not so
good as Windbag* perhaps, he looks a
better horse than Nightmarch. And,
apart from Peter Pan, who has been
giving his trainer trouble and may, after
the fashion of some stallions, be getting
a bit cranky, he has no uncommon field to
beat. Nightly (9st. 41b.) is no champion.
Though not a big horse, Hall Mark
is very sturdily built. He has proved
himself a thorough stayer* and very
game. He was not himself last autumn,
as witness his third to Limarch and the
very second-rate Blixten in the A.J.C.
St. Leger, but this season he is perfectly
fit—has, in fact, never been so well.
Hall Mark has had 24 races and won
11. He has only thrice been out of a
place—twice as a two-year-old and once
when he was out of sorts last Easter ;
even then he ran a very good sixth in
the A.J.C. King’s Cup.
As a winner of the Sydney Cup and
the V.A.T.C. Herbert Power Stakes.(with
Bst. 61b.), Broad
Arrow must be ac-
counted well
treated with Bst.
The Derby winner,
whoever it may be,
nearly always has
to be reckoned
with; if Glads-
wood runs well
without winning,
7st. is a handy
weight for a three-
year-old that stays
a bit. If Sir Simper
(7st. 71b.) is a
stayer, he will beat
all the young ones ;
but in this respect
he is a doubt-
ful quantity. Journal (Bst. 31b.), how-
ever, has a decided chance ; the weight
is more likely to trouble the lightly
fleshed fellow than the actual distance.
Rogilla (9st. 71b.) takes 31b. from Peter
Pan and gives 51b. to Hall Mark. Defeat
of either looks beyond him, yet he' has
a trick of running his best races when
not greatly fancied by the public.
The club is giving £lO,OOO in stake-
money and a £2OO trophy. It deserves to
get a great race for the money.
* * * *
Perhaps the most idiotic of the many
idiotic laws passed by Australian poli-
ticians are those which forbid pre-post
publication of prices in N. S. Wales and
Victoria. It is doubtful whether they ever
prevented a wager, though that was the
intention; the only effect they’ve had
has been to cramp the odds. Long ago
great (and small) dailies hit upon a way
of evading these laws, the formula going
like this:
Tom Fool.
Interval of one.
Idiot.
Interval of two.
Numskull.
Interval of one.
Simpleton.
Interval of three.
Chump.
Interval of four.
Halfwit.
Interval of six.
It has never been certain whether or not
the law applies to overseas events. When
the betting on the air race was cabled
from Newmarket, the “Argus” took a
chance and published the odds as re-
ceived: 10 to 1 Parmentier; 12 to 1
Scott, the Mollisons and Turner ; 14 to 1
Cathcart Jones, and so on. “S. M.
Herald,” which always plays for safety,
trotted out the preposterous formula.
The Nineteenth Hole
The Ma State professional golf cham-
pionship was won on the Bonnie Doon
course last week by V. S. Richardson,
who also annexed the title in 1932. Rich-
ardson did the 72 holes in 289, a mag-
nificent performance, beating the next
man, Kelly, by six strokes. The title-
holder, C. Gray, was fourth.
* * * *
“Carnoustie”: It would appear as if
Kirkwood and Sarazen are as the Heav-
enly Twins save in one particular—Sara-
zen’s favorite hat, a highly exotic look-
“Get away from me rod! Wotcher think this is—a blasted maypole?”
ing product which the American cham-
pion pleads guilty to buying at Buenos
Aires. Several times it has disappeared,
only to come back again. The last flit
was' at Indooroopilly (Q.) links. Here
an hour’s frantic search discovered it,
crushed and dejected, somewhere in the
locker room. No charges were made
against anyone, but Kirkwood was heard
to mutter, as his cobber uttered cries of
joy over the returned prodigal, “The
darned thing ought to be burned.”
He * H= *
“Ecclefechan”: One of Sarazen’s after-
dinner yarns ought to be true, if it isn’t.
When he began touring “the smalls” he
found the tournaments in the hands of
a close corporation of players, all of
whom were Scots. These travelled in a
band round the bigger towns where golf
was then beginning to boom and made
good money. Sarazen tried to join, but
was spurned when he told his name. By
an inspiration he rechristened himself
“MacSarazen” and, jumping a train, re-
joined the circus. This time, as he was
already a good player, he was accepted
and told that the spoils would be divided
equally among all after each tourney.
There were two good purses at that show,
and “MacSarazen” won them both.
When it came to dividing, the elders
tried to take advantage of his youth and
fob him off with a few dollars. Sarazen
simply says, “There was a fight, and I got
my money,” so let’s leave it at that.
* * i * *
“Divot Digger”: There has been a bit
of heartburning among N.S.W. pro-
fessional golfers over the Australian
team to play the Americans at the Lakes
course on November 9 and 10. As chosen
it was Bolger, Cohen, Richardson,
Kelly and Don Spence, of N.S.W., with
Naismith, of Victoria, and Rufus Stewart,
from South Australia. Kelly has refused
to play, and, as he was open champion
of Australia last year and professional
titleholder this, his absence will be
serious. Kelly says he wants to get to
Melbourne to practise for the big cen-
tenary money, and play in the inter-
national match will only allow him a
couple of days instead of the fortnight
or so he is after.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: An interesting personality
who landed in Sydney the other day was
H. Guilen. One expected to see him
clad in pontifical scarlet robes, with
attendant acolytes swinging censers, for
he is secretary, and therefore high priest,
of the golfers’ holy of holies. His present
business is keeping control of the
English amateur golf team touring Aus-
tralia. The St. Andrews secretary
dropped one little hint that should make
a few Australian ears burn. He said
his team had been asked to play in exhi-
bition matches, but “amateurs did not
play in exhibition matches.”
* * * *
“Prestwick”: Sydney entertained a
mighty golfer of other days for a fleet-
ing moment when Beaumont Pease
passed through to Melbourne for the
centenary. He is chairman of Lloyd’s
Bank, and has been skipper of the Royal
and Antient—a much more important
job. Pease was in the last eight of the
British amateur championship in 1900,
1903 and 1928, and played for England
against Scotland in 1903-04-05-06. He
is only a spectator to-day.
Ins and Outs
“Kennington”: The Duke and the air
race made Australians quite oblivious to
a fact that would have thrilled them to
their socks a week or so ago—Bradman
has been allowed out of bed, and now
takes car rides from hospital as a con-
valescent. His wife joined him in Lon-
don at the week-end, and the pair will
spend a fortnight in the South of Eng-
land before leaving for Australia.
* * # #
“Shrewsbury”: William Pollock, the
English cricket writer, has fluttered the
dovecots by placing Bradman third to
Trumper and Macartney among Austra-
lian batsmen. Comparisons of the kind
are more than odorous. But I fancy,
with many others, that Bradman has yet
to meet bowlers of the calibre of Hirst,
Briggs, Braund, Bosanquet, Rhodes,
Barnes and F. R. Foster, with Woolley
and Tate at their best, to name only a
few. Bradman’s most formidable an-
tagonist to date has been Larwood, and
that only on Australian wickets.
# * t- *•
“Aunt Sally”: Bill Hunt’s reappearance
for Balmain after a season in England
with the Lancashire League suggests that
he will be a mudh improved bowler
when he picks up the feel of the pitches
again. He is now bowling round the
wicket with more spin and less pace. He
says he has studied the styles of Verity,
Langridge and other slow left-handers
with profit. So far, the N.S.W. selectors
don’t seem to know he is back.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Whenever an English
team comes to Australia, even people
like Warner cry that they have never
heard in England barracking approach-
ing that prevalent in this country. Writer,
who lived for some years, in Southern
Lancashire and saw much county cricket
there, has asserted time and again in
The Bulletin that the barracking at
grounds like Old Trafford and Bramall-
lane in Yorkshire is not only incredibly
vicious but often tends to the obscene,
this last a tag I defy anyone to fasten
to a Sydney “hill” barracker. Bowler
Hunt, just returned to his native Sydney
after a year with the Lancashire Cricket
League, has the same story to tell as
regards the tumult and noise. Hunt says
that his salvation was that he was un-
able to learn the language of the abori-
gines, and never knew whether they were
for or against him.
Racquet and Bawl
“Ca 5 Canny”: The decision of the
A.L.T.A. to make honorary life mem-
bers of Perry and Hughes may be a
bit premature. Perry is confessedly
on the verge of professionalism. If the
new English proposal as to players who
sell tennis goods becomes law, Hughes
will go over the brink. Lenglen, Cochet
and Tilden had the ignominious experi-
ence, when they presented their life mem-
bers’ tickets at the last Wimbledon, of
being told that their lapse to profession-
alism had cancelled the membership, and
that if they wanted to see the tennis
they must pay like other outsidahs.
* * * £
“Top Spin”: Cabled that the French-
men Brugnon and Boussus sailed from
Cherbourg for their tennis tour of Aus-
tralia on October 20. They will miss the
N.S.W. championships by a wide margin,
but are to play the first match of their
Australian tour at Newcastle, where their
opponents will be the “same old” Craw-
ford and McGrath.
*** * .
“Milton”: Queensland’s L.T.A., which
hasn’t been playing kiss-in-the-ring with
its N.S.W. cobbers for a time, recently
refused an invitation to come to Sydney
and join with Ma and Victoria in an inter-


SECRET OF GREATER
STRENGTH AND SAFETY
More Rubber in New Perdriau Tread
More rubber! That’s one of the com monsense ways
Perdriau engineers have answered the call for more
tyre safety and economy! Higher average speeds and
faster cornering called for more grip on the road —so
now Perdriau’s famous double triangle tread is broader
and flatter. “ And give us more miles,” said motorists
—so now more of that double tough tread rubber adds
extra thousands of safe miles to the life of every
Perdriau. Read the facts below and you’ll want
Perdriau on your wheels.
-
r
i
v.
THICKER,
HUSKIER TREAD
GIVES CONFIDENCE
Never before has a tyre given such a
sure-footed grip on the road. Even when
you speed round a corner, or when the speedo
swings past 70 or 80, Perdriau is holding on
like a limpet. And extra tread thickness
makes this safety longer-lasting. What pro-
tection a road-grip like this brings to every
person in the car!
Perdriau “SHOULDERS" responsibility
When you see your Perdriau
size, particularly note the mas-
sive shoulders. In addition to
giving extra road-grip they
ease the weight evenly into the
sidewalls—preventing all pos-
sibility of casing failure at the
flexing point. You’ll note, too,
how they add to the handsome
appearance which makes Per-
driau an asset on the smartest
car.

THE TIMES

What sectional
study reveals
Thickness, broadness and deeper tread
patterning are obvious, of course. But see
how those thousands of cords actually
“float” in live, resilient rubber! This double
insulation stops destructive heat spreading
from cord to cord. The cords themselves
are “balanced” in the essentials of tensile
strength and elasticity. On any Perdriau
you can feel with your hands the extra
flexibility that this casing construction gives.
And its longer life lets your pocket, too,
feel the difference.
Dealers Enthusiastic
No wonder tyre dealers are
full of praise for this grand
tyre. With no increase in
price (still the lowest prices
in tyre history), it offers far
greater value than ever be-
fore. Your local Perdriau
dealer has your size ready to
fit!
a
State “triangular” match. The Banana-
landers have now changed their minds,
much to the satisfaction of Ma, who
smells a bigger gate. Six players will
also come down to take their part in
the State championships, which begin
Nov. 21, and possibly Mrs. Molesworth,
now on her way back from England, may
help to make up a women’s side.
* * * *
“All In”: Nothing like being frank.
One Sydney tennis scribe, urging the dis-
patch of another Davis Cup team, adds
that, if Perry turnsi professional, the
failure to send a team over would be
spurning the gifts of Providence. This
eagerness to profit by the other side’s
misfortunes recalls an anti-Rugby Union
drawing in a Melbourne paper when the
loathed “foreign” code was again rearing
its head. Two small boys were watching
a Rugby match through a hole in the
fence. Said one: “There’s another car-
ried orf. Wait on, an’ the lot’ll be in
the ’orspital. Then we nick in an’ git
the ball.”
Miscellaneous
The most important section of the
air race from England to Australia, the
speed trial, was won by Scott and Black.
In a De Havilland Comet, the pair cut
out the distance from Mildenhall to Mel-
bourne in 2 days 23 hours. Second came
the Dutchmen Parmentier and Moll in
a Douglas. After a forced landing at
Albury they finished in 3 days 18 hours
18 minutes. Americans Turner and
Pangborn filled the third place, so the
finish was cosmopolitan enough. Their
time was 3 days 21 hours 5 minutes.
The prizes seem trifling compared with
the risk and fatigue incurred. Scott’s
backer pouches £lO,OOO, the Dutchmen
lift £l5OO and Turner takes £5OO. The
official judge announces that he expects
no protests. Prizes will be reserved for
the agreed-on eight days, all the same,
before being paid.
* * * *
“Slyde”: Sambell, of the London R.C.
crew, was captain of Melbourne Gram-
mar. He was originator of the “synco-
pated” rowing system, which has died
untimely. Sambell and the Melbourne
scholar-rower Luxton were mates in the
last Cambridge crew. They started as
rowing associates at Melbourne Gram-
mar. At one period Sambell was cap-
tain of boats at Grammar, while Luxton
was stroke. Sambell is secretary of the
Cambridge Boat Club and captain of
Pembroke. His father, A. K. T. Sam-
bell, is one of Victoria’s leading civil
engineers and president of the Phillip
Island Shire Council.
# * * • *
“Stretcher”: The Wanganui (M.L.)
eight-oar crew to row at Henley-on-
Yarra and on the Parramatta are
the usual big and muscular lot we
expect to get from the Shivery Isles,
and their trial spin before going on
to Melbourne showed them A 1 ex-
ponents of the All-Black style—the
orthodpx English method. Average age
is 26 and weight 12st. lib. The youth of
the eight is Cecil Healy, who, at 38, is
better than ever as a stroke. He was
here with the All-Black eight in 1925.
Abbott and Smith are the tourists’
scullers.
* * * *
‘‘Green Chequer”: In N.S.W. pigeon-
racing doesn’t receive the attention it
deserves, though Victorians and South
Australians are mighty supporters of the
sport. The N.S.W. racing-pigeon club
held a 400-mile Derby the other day
which gave the mugs an idea of how
fast these birds can travel. First and
second places went to L. Dibley’s pair,
the winner being a blue chequer hen
which averaged 1239 yards a minute,
the second being only a yard a minute
slower. Fanciers like to fly a hen with
squabs in the nest, the idea being that
she claps on extra pace to get back to
her wifely duties. Here we may note
the difference between pigeons’ wives
and some golf associates.

The Sugar Company’s Profits
The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. is
going to double its £5,850,000 of capital
by issuing bonus shares to that value.
What at first looks like an imprudent step
in these troubled days is really a wise
one. The p.c. div. which has come
along without a break since 1925 has
always been misleading, suggesting a
ratio of profits to capital which might
not be justified. The point is that the
co.’s capital account has never really
represented truly the net book value of
the assets ; shareholders have had more
capital in the shape of undistributed
increment and earnings at work in the
undertaking than the accounts suggest.
Instead of p.c. the rate of distribu-
tion immediately following the capitalisa-
tion will be 6| p.c. p.a., which will be a
truer indication of what the net assets
are earning. A considerable proportion
of the div. nowadays represents income
from reserve fund investments.
As usual, the proposals have drawn
the attention of critics. Actually, under
its agreement with the Queensland Gov-
ernment, the co. receives £1 a ton foi
depreciation and management, 6s. 4d.
for financing, and 7s. for selling each ton
of about 90 p.c. of the Australian sugar
consumption. The management charge
is less than one-eighth of a penny a
pound, and the whole £1 13s. 4d. repre-
sents only 0.18 pence a pound.
The Sugar Inquiry Committee in 1932
estimated that out of its allowances the
C.S.R. makes a profit of about 255. a ton
—less than a seventh of a penny a
pound. The same authority also reck-
oned that the return to the co. under
the sugar agreement was 5 p.c. on the
book value of the assets concerned, and
that the book figures were about half
replacement value.
Sugar is retailed in Australia at 4d. a
pound. The grower and miller get about
£23 a ton for raws consumed locally, and
the wholesale price—the price at which it
leaves the Sugar Board’s hands —is £33
4s. The added cost in passing from
the raw to the refined (and distributed)
state is about £lO a ton ; the grocer gets
more than £4.
A Real Industry Now?
Months ago mining-share speculators
were here warned against promiscuous
dabbling ; in effect, gambling in paper,
not mines. It was pointed out that the
big danger would arise as soon as the
market’s appetite for new floats be-
came sated ; there would inevitably be a
separation of the froth from the real
stuff. Those concerns which are unable
to show anything substantial to warrant
their previous optimistic share prices are
now slipping in favor. The market is
becoming saturated with mining scrip ;
the unfortunate thing is that the good
paper is depressed with the rubbish.
The hot air is so far being expelled
gently. Over a month there have been a
dozen or more comparatively large-sized
floats, and they have drawn off a good
deal of the cash that would be otherwise
available to buoy up listed stocks. Pro-
bably more from necessity than sweet
reasonableness the market is now waiting
op the industry to prove itself; hitherto
it has been a game of passing the scrip
round.
Gold seems to be more assured of a
high price than any commodity under
present conditions. World trade —unfor-
tunately—still points to low commodity
prices and low wages. Genuine com-
panies with genuine propositions have a
great opportunity to do big things for
their shareholders ; but the time is pass-
ing when punters can rely on “those in-
side” giving a show “a run on the
market.” Buyers at last are showing
some signs of sophistication ; a propo-
sition has to have the goods, or show rea-
sonable signs of being able to get them.
Up to date we have had a gold-share
boom ; we are now awaiting the real
gold boom —though a better word might
be sought for. In Australia everything is
set for it, except that most of the newer
floats have not yet reached production.
When they do start the position should
crystallise and speculation gradually
pass to a sounder basis.
Female and Child Labor
The number of persons employed in
N.S.W. factories last year averaged
129,907 —there has been an increase of
about 30 p.c. since 1915. The peak was
reached in 1926 with 151,000.
A striking feature of the figures is
the growth in female labor. Increase in
males employed since 1915 represents 28
p.c.; in females, 39 p.c. Since 1926 male
“A fine pub this is! Where’s y’r trough?”
employment has fallen off by 19,000, or
18 p.c., and female by only 5 p.c. In the
Sydney metropolitan area there are fewer
male workers than in any year between
1919 and 1929, but females show an in-
crease over every year of the period ex-
cept one. Female workers have in-
creased 8000 since the post-war year,
against a decrease in males of 2000.
The age figures also are striking. Fifty
per cent, of all females employed in
N.S.W. factories are under 21 and 29.7
p.c. under 18. Of males, 23 p.c. have
not' reached their majority. A permit
is needed to employ a child under 14.
The male employment rate for minors is
about proportional to the number of
males between 14 and 65 in the popula-
tion ; but the female rate represents
double quota, despite the fact that few
women work after 30, marriage or occu-
pations other than factory work claiming
them by that time.
The Promoters’ Side
“Pax”: I manage the Sydney office of
a concern which sells shares in a plan-
tation co. My men have never received
more than 10 p.c. commission on selling
shares, and they have to provide their
own cars, petrol and other travelling
exes. They have succeeded in raising
enough money to establish the co., and
on the planting side the job has been
done at a minimum cost. There have
been no rake-offs for anyone.
The plantations are a long-term specu-
lation. Some day, we hope, they will
pay dividends which will compensate for
the waiting. That, admittedly, is in the
lap of the gods. But one thing is cer-
tain : though Stock Exchange members
have done nothing to help establish this
concern, if it ever reaches the div.-paying
stage they will be the ones who will reap
the benefits as far as transfers of scrip
are concerned. My men —“go-getters”
they are not —who have done all the
hard spadework will fade out of the
picture.
i realise that for every reliable share-
salesman on the road there may be two
or three go-getters. But the entire pro-
hibition of share-canvassing would not
be fair, and would be a further link in
the chain of legislative restriction which
is tying private enterprise hand and foot.
License share-salesmen, make them enter
into fidelity bonds and be subject to
police supervision, but above all strike
at the root of the evil —introduce an
adequate Companies Act as suggested in
your issue of 3/10/’34. That is what
our legislators seem afraid of—to make
the bigger established cos. subject to the
same obligations as small new floats.
Maoriland Companies’ Commission
has delivered its final report. It recom-
mends the establishment of a corporate
investments bureau with discretionary
powers to pass prospectuses and investi-
gate complaints against companies after
establishment. It proposes the aboli-
tion of the bond system of land utilisa-
tion, and suggests that no co. whose sub-
scribed capital is less than £40,000
(£20,000 payable in cash) should be
allowed to function as an investment
trust.

Thanks partly to preferences, Fiji
represents a market for about £283,000
worth of Australian produce a year. Aus-
tralia reciprocates to the extent of buy-
ing only about £33,000 p.a. Unless Aus-
tralia opens the door wider to Fiji
bananas special penal duties may be in-
troduced by Fiji on Australian imports—
mostly textiles, flour and machinery.
Though duty on the bananas was nomi-
nally reduced from Bs. 4d. to 2s. 6d. a
cental under the Ottawa agreement,
primage and other taxes make the effec-
tive duty about ss. a cental. At the
moment Australian bananas are dirt-
cheap, and that ought to be borne in
mind by Fiji.

For the first quarter of the new fiscal
year Victoria’s trade balance shows
£3,561,483 sterling to the bad, compared
with £1,688,940 for the corresponding

Wool exports are down by nearly half,
wheat values are £lOO,OOO less, and dried
fruits £300,000 down. Mutton and lamb
exports rose nearly £300,000, and the
State’s gold shipments show steady ex-
pansion. Chief rise in imports is trace-
able to motor-cars, machinery and tex-
tiles.

At the Commonwealth Bank in Syd-
ney two coin-testing machines invented
by an Australian, Little, are operat-
ing. Each is worked electrically. One
is fed with florins at the rate of
100 in four minutes; the good coins
pass through the machine into a
linen bag, but counterfeits are diverted
automatically into a special container.
This machine also records the num-
ber of good coins tested. The other
gadget is equipped with a graded dial
marked “6d.,” “15.,” “25.” If a genuine
coin is placed on a
sensitised spot on
the machine the
hand on the dial
points to the cor-
rect denomination.
But if, for instance,
a florin is tested
and the hand
points between 6d.
and Is. the coin is
known to be spuri-
ous.

Royal Auto.
Club of Vic. is
asking that two-
thirds of the petrol
lax collected by
the Commonwealth
Government should
be passed on to
the States for road-
construction and
-maintenance, half
of the distribution to be whacked up on
the present basis of allocation, the rest
according to the petrol consumed in each
State. H. J. Bean, a member of the
executive, complains that motorists at
present are not only paying for main-
road improvements, but that millions in
motor-taxation go into consolidated
revenue.

“Abinger” (B. 10/10 / ’34)
refers to the lasting qualities of weather-
board houses. When in Philadelphia
(U.S.A.) six years ago I visited the house
which William Penn built when he first
settled there. It has been kept painted
but showed no signs of important repair,
and looked as if it had been put up
within the last decade. Around Boston
are hundreds of pre-revolution resi-
dences, those where the Tories lived being
still marked with black bands around the
chimneys. Those houses are one and all
in perfect repair. Yanks told me the
secret was that nails were not used ; the
boards were fastened with wooden plugs.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Queensland Lands
Queensland has a very efficient depart-
ment in the Land Administration Board,
which, controlling 96 p.c. of the area of
the State, manages forestry, settlement,
prickly-pear eradication and water supply
and irrigation. It is run on un-
bureaucratic lines by a barrister with a
practical land-administration training, an
Under-Secretary and a forester. Rarely is
a word of serious criticism levelled
against it, mainly because it has no time
for red-tape and is always ready to see
the settler’s viewpoint and meet him in
his difficulties.
Small graziers have to thank it for ex-
tensions of 3441 leases and rental re-
ductions which aggregate £327,000 under
the wool relief scheme put into operation
during the depression. Everywhere in
Queensland expansion has been in pro-
gress.
Over 2,000,000 acres of pastoral land
are being subdivided for closer settle-
ment, and there is continual
and extensive adjustment of
tenures going on to aid Crown
tenants.
Farm lands are obtainable
cheaply— rents of 160-acre
dairy farms range to as low
as £7 10s. p.a. Where pur-
chasers or lessees fall into
arrears, the board waives the
law which prescribes the pay-
ment of 10 p.c. interest and
makes it 5 p.c. In no year
during the depression were
fewer than 24,000,000 acres
made available. In 1931,
55,000,000 acres were disposed
of. The total applied for in
six years was 205,000,000 acres
—not all new settlement, of
course, by a long way, but still
a staggering area.
To encourage merino-stud
breeding, special concessions
have been given since 1928 to
breeders who will sell a cer-
tain number of rams locally
each year under liberal con-
ditions. This has resulted in
19 studs being established.
The board has original ideas
on unemployment. It doesn’t
believe in Government-managed relief
work, always subject to political influence,
but it squeezed £370,000 out of a reluctant
Treasury and passed it out in loans to
2694 rural borrowers who engaged to
employ additional labor on improve-
ments. Part-time work for 10,524 men
was found. The banks warmly backed
the scheme, and in many cases guaran-
teed the loans, granting priority to the
Crown mortgage. Already, though the
idea is only three years old, 70 loans
have been repaid in full, and interest pay-
ments are up to date except in a small
proportion of cases. This year £lOO,OOO
will be found by Mr. Forgan Smith. He
should have made it a million and cut
out some of his other wasteful semi-
political “relief” activities. Over 5,300,000
acres of reclaimed prickly-pear lands
were offered for settlement, bringing the
total for three years to 13,000,000 acres
-—a block twice the size of Belgium.
The board is doing a good job.
The North Is Free!
“Binghi”: This Darwin is no place
for a decent abo. You can’t get a drink,
even if you are only half-caste. The
beer is reserved for imported races. You
mustn’t eat opium. You mustn’t stay in
town except under, special permit, and as
that is always published in the “Govern-
ment Gazette” and is full of “whereases”
you can’t understand it, so it’s no use
anyway. Collar a chicken from a Cin-
galese {he can get a noggin if he wants
one) and M.C. Koop charges you with
“being in a prohibited area” and asks
for a salutary penalty. My friend Jacky
Jacky had a narrow escape from his
clutches the other day. Dinah de Silva
saw him leaving in the night via the
back fence, and when the chooks were
counted four weren’t there. But as
those fowls were never seen again Jacky
was given the benefit of the doubt. If
you pinch a bit of beef you get a year’s
hard without the option for “illegal pos-
session”—that was the stretch handed
out' to two dark lads of Timber Creek
the other day. I thought of starting a
newspaper to protest, but as the Adminis-
tration has revived a shocking ordinance
under which publishers must enter into
a bond of several hundred pounds not
to make too raucous comments on the
civil service, etc., it is beyond my means.
"I hear you stole some fowls the other night, Jacky.”
“You never hear dis pfeller, boss. Someone tell you.”
They even put the come-hither on the
local parson for one of these guarantees
the other day—he publishes a parish
magazine! It won’t be long at the rate
we are going before they declare the
whole Territory a prohibited area for
abos. and make all whites not in the
civil service enter into a bond before
they are allowed to live.
“Attack Creek”: An argument at
Tennant Creek has brought civilisation
a step nearer to the N.T. According to
a Darwin police statement, two miners
named Potts and Renfrey had an alterca-
tion. Renfrey produced a revolver. A
bystander named O’Brien picked up a
rifle to prevent trouble, and was shot. He
died. Renfrey has been committed for
trial, and the Administrator has declared
“all that part of the N.T. within a
radius of 20 miles of Kilgariff’s Hotel,
Tennant Creek,” to be subject to the
Firearms’ Registration Ordinance. When
I first went down the O.T. line, it was
forbidden to travel without arms —if you
hadn’t got them they supplied you at a
telegraph station, and you delivered them
at the next station. That wasn’t so long
ago either.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: The sort of shock which a
historian would feel if he suddenly met
C. Julius Caesar awaits some North
Queenslander who visits Glenthompson
(Vic.). There he will find John Fraser,
a relic of Atherton Tableland pioneer-
ing, who went north in the days when
Mackay and Towns were still looking
for ports. He and John Atherton fell
in with each other on the track, and
established neighboring homesteads on
the tableland. Mr. Fraser’s was Mit-
chell Vale. A few years ago he returned
to his native heath, and he has celebrated
his 80th birthday by patenting a new
type of claw-hammer, specially designed
to deal with corrugated-iron.
* * * #
“Vic”: Scene, a carriage on the
Darwin-Katherine express. Passengers,
three flappers smoking like chimneys. At
Burrundie enter Bill the Buffalo-shooter.
Misconstruing his disgusted expression,
which is induced only by the presence of
females, one of the sweet young things
remarked: “I hope you don’t mind us
smoking.” “Oh, not at all,” says Bill
kindly; “all the lubras in my outfit
smoke.” Social intercourse then ceases,
and no sound is heard but the coughing
of the N.T.’s ancient engine.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Gardens must have been stripped to honor
the Russian ballerinas, now gone south. Little
Juliana Enakieff, in brilliant gipsy costume,
banging a tambourine, and Algeranoff, gyrat-
ing in the mazes of a Magyar dance, are two
outstanding memories.
Algy acquired his costume on the spot; eight
yards of material went into each pleated trouser
leg, and two yards into each sleeve. His
scarlet leather boots made a vivid splash of
color as the cream trouserings swung out in
a circle wider than any ballet skirt could
achieve. As a hint to housewives, the pleat-
ing was done with long rolls of hot, new
bread.
Captain and Mrs. P. W. Attride, whose home
is in Waziristan, arrived by the Moldavia.
He is in the Indian Army, and they are spend-
ing leave in Queensland. Mrs. Attride is a
Tasmanian.
Another interesting Moldavia traveller was
Miss G. E. Littlewood, M.8.E., an inspector
of Indian girls’ schools. She was born in
Burma. Over 160 schools and 15,000 girl
pupils come under her eye, as do a number
of older women. She was awarded the Kaisar-
i-Hind Medal, first-class.
Audrey Forth finished up her round of
pre-wedding teas and now is on the high
seas, en route to India and Tom Warland,
her waiting bridegroom. Her three sisters,
Mesdames P. Allom, B. O’Sullivan and Her-
ries—the last goes to India with her —staged a
big at-home at the residence of their father,
E. E. Forth, who goes to hand over the bride.
The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress gave
a civic reception to Malcolm and Sheila Mac-
Donald, Ramsay’s son and daughter. Malcolm,
who seems a cheerful though businesslike soul,
is Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the
Dominions. Sheila knows how to wear
clothes, and her beige tailored suit, worn with
a Habana-brown blouse and hat, was the
latest in chic. Water-lilies and gerberas were
in the bouquet given to her. F. W. Bulcock,
Minister for Agriculture, is doing a two-weeks
tour with Malcolm; and Sheila is visiting
friends in the Toowoomba and Texas dis-
tricts.
Air races have a very levelling effect. While
the loudspeakers of thousands of radios were
announcing that Scott was due to arrive in
Charleville at any minute, flat doors were
burst open, even in the most reserved and
swankiest of buildings, and pyjama’d strangers
of both sexes flung in to hear the news. The
owners of the wireless sets received the in-
vasion with enthusiasm; and the astonishing
spectacle of grey-haired ladies roaring the
latest news to their radioless acquaintances over
the way was quite common.
Mrs. Forgan Smith opened the fete held at
Montrose, the Crippled Children’s Home.
There were the usual stalls, and a musical
programme arranged by Mrs. R. J. Trotter.
Some of the small inmates contributed songs
and recitations..
Judging by the wardrobes of returning travel-
lers and overseas visitors, chocolate-brown is
the latest thing in London. Mary Luya, who
came back on the Otranto, wore a chocolate-
brown blouse and hat and carried a chocolate-
brown bag with her oatmeal linen coat and
skirt.
Just by way of keeping it in the family,
the Harbor Lights Guild asked M. G. C.
Pasco, of Toowoomba, to deliver its tra-
falgar Day lecture. An ancestor was with
Nelson at the battle.
When Mrs. N. O’Brien and Miss Maud
McGrath return to Brisbane at the end of
November, after attending the inter-State
Catholic Women’s Conference, they will be
Federal president and Federal secretary respec-
tively. It is this State’s turn to take over the
Federal honors for a period of two years.
News has just been received of the marriage
at Salisbury Cathedral, Rhodesia, Rev.
Gibbs officiating, of Lorna White, third
daughter of the F. W. Whites, of Clayfield,
and David Edward Oates, third son of Mr.
and Mrs. R. G. Oates, of Belmont, Brisbane.
Major Hoskins-Davies gave the bride away,
Mrs. Rupert Hawley was matron of honor,
and Rupert Hawley was best man. The
wedding garment was of ice-blue silk matelassd,
semi-trained and girdled with silver. An ice-
blue and silver Breton sailor hat and a sheaf
of pink carnations gave the finishing touches.
In December the Masefields are to pay us a
visit; and Sir Arthur and Lady Weigall and
their daughter will arrive from Melbourne.
Madeline McGuire, who wears John Mc-
Gee’s engagement ring (his father is the In-
come-tax Commissioner), has been asked by
Speaker George Pollock to take charge of the
housing and feeding of the Duke and his staff
at Parliament House during his Brisbane stay.
Madeline is a B.A. of Sydney Uni., and already
has had a whirl at business. Hitherto her
activities have been literary rather than
domestic.
About 80 girls of Rockhampton High School
were present at the annual reunion and dinner
and jazz. Miss L. Hodge, president of the
association and of the school staff, was pre-
sented with an inkstand. Vice-president Doris
Whitman, secretary Ivy Reiger and the com-
mittee helped to look after the guests.

A WOMAN'T
LETTER
With his head whirling with parades
of Girl Guides and school-children and
Red Crossers, the royal visitor arrived
at Canberra by way of Albury, Junee,
Wagga, Harden, Cootamundra, Yass and
Goulburn. At Bungendore he dropped
in for the Diggers’ Ball. Mrs. Pat
Osborne and Mrs. F. B. S. Falkiner were
his partners, and Major-Gen. Howard-
Vyse danced heartily.
The doings at Canberra struck the high
note of the royal progress. (Sydney has
been quite a deserted village the last
week, young and old of both sexes,
the fair and the merely tinted having
rushed up to the Federal capital with
their best dresses in layers of tissue and
a whole cargo of brand-new tails.) Flags
fluttered, aeroplanes whirred, bands
played, guns boomed out their welcome,
awnings were gay, and of course Can-
berra’s tulips were at their best, while
soldiers, Boy Scouts and Girl Guides
helped to compose the dashing prelude.
Canberra turned out to the last man
and the last shilling along the tree-lined
avenues to greet the Prince.
On the steps of Parliament House the
G.-G. and Lady Isaacs handed out a
second reception to the Duke (they had
already greeted him at the railway sta-
tion), and at the top of the steps Prim-
inister Lyons and his wife bade him wel-
come. Then, before the portals of the
House closed on him, the tall young man
turned his face to the spirited groups
whose enthusiasm burst forth in the
National Anthem. Cosily within the
rooms of President Lynch, of the Senate,
the Ministers of State and their wives
were presented.
The Prince spent two days at Can-
berra, and for a time it looked as if he
would have to stay longer, for rain over
a wide region brought floods. He made
merry at the Prime Minister’s Lodge,
while the head of the family purred
amiabilities among masses of del-
phinium, red roses and flowering haw-
thorn, and the Lyons cubs had a great
time watching the arrival of the guests.
Mrs. Lyons, clever and charming, wore
flowered chiffons, colorful as a bed of
tulips. The N. S. Wales Premier’s wife
and daughter and Mrs. Earle Page were
among the well-dressed crowd. Harry
Gullett’s lady, under her brown beret,
turned a vivacious eye on the party. Mrs.
E. T. Crutchley added smart black-and-
whiles to the assembly. Helen Hughes
and Helen Best, later on to be the Duke’s
dancing partners, were among the ex-
clusive 100, mostly composed of the Min-
istry and its womenfolk.
By the time the Duke got to the State
Ball in Canberra he must have been
able to identify every member of the
Ministry and his better-half on sight.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite (but she
didn’t dance with him) declares he was
even heard, in an absent-minded moment,
humming “Your Bright Smile Haunts
Me Still.” Billy Hughes and Archdale
Parkhill were on the horizon at the
moment. Of course, other people be-
sides Parliamentarians were admitted,
but' only if they were of Australia’s
equivalent of Norman blood. Simple
faith got it's possessors no further than
the barrier outside the doors of Federal
Parliament House, for it was here,
within the King’s Hall, that revelry ran
high.
In all there were 1250 guests, flashing
medals, military and Consular uniforms
and frocks of beauty in translucent
satins, in chiffons blazing with flowers
in and out of season, in * thistledown
tulles and laces. Out of the glitter
emerged the silver laces and diamond
tiara of Lady Milne, the emerald-green
of Harry Gullett’s wife’s mandarin coat,
stiff with embroideries, the gold-em-
broidered kimono worn by the wife of
Japan’s Consul-General, the black vel-
vets of Mrs. A. J. Macarthur Onslow and
the green-and-gold tissues of Elizabeth
Knox.
The Governor-General and his lady,
whose ball it was, glowed with satisfac-
tion as they looked down the hall bathed
in its blue and rose-red lights, jocund
with red, white and blue garlands and
plaques, impressive with its bronze
statue of the King and the fine avenue
of white-helmeted artillerymen who
lined the way to the dais. The Duke
looked every inch a soldier in Hussar
uniform. Lady Isaacs’s silver satins
drew a long train and wore a
thick twist of diamente about the neck-
line ; Mrs. Lyons, who, with the Pre-
mier, had received the vice-regals when
they arrived with the intimate group
who had dined with Prince Henry
at Government House, wore creamily-
pink laces. Helen Hughes, who was the
Duke’s first partner, must get a special
mention for her sky-after-rain-blue satins,
which swung a waist-length cape. Other
Helens who have
now reached the
high estate of
royal partners are
Helene Best, of
M e 1 b o urne (a
goddaughter o f
the G.-G.’s lady),
and Helen
Adams, of Can-
berra. Hilda
Abbott, one of
the 35 shining-
eyed, wh i le-
frocked debs.,
was another who
danced with the
King’s son before
he rushed off to
Queanbeyan t o
catch his train.
The Duke of
Gloucester found
the Book of Re-
membrance one
of Albury’s most
interesting exhi-
bits. This is the
district’s honor
roll, and was pre-
sented by Mrs. F.
B. S. Falkiner to
the city. A fresh
page of the beau-
tifully - lettered
names of the sol-
diers in the late
war is turned
every day, and
its border is
richly illuminated
in the manner of
some old missal.
The binding is of Madonna-blue set with
lour black opals, from which spray
golden Annunciation lilies and leaves.
Among the clubs that didn’t put up
their shutters during the week’s rush to
the southern and Federal capitals was
the Queen Victoria. Its big flutter was
a welcome-home to Lady Game. With
her greetings, the president, Mrs. Arthur
Scrivener, handed the guest a basket brim-
ming over with lily-of-the-valley. Sir
Hugh Poynter, who brought his lady,
added further words of welcome. Queen
Victoria’s portrait wore for the occasion
the Duke of Gloucester’s colors in red
and blue flowers. Soprano Grace Simp-
son flung a spray of crystal notes as
round and rosy as herself above the sea
of appreciative faces, Mrs. Brigham’s one
of the most eager. The Mayoral lady,
Mrs. Harry Budge, Con. Director Bain-
ton, his wife and daughter Guenda also
turned the ear of attention. Small-boy
pianist Jack Freeman played the com-
position he had dedicated to Lady Game,
gaining a round of applause.
Another outsize welcome-back party
to the Games was staged by Lieut.-Gov.
Street and his wife at their home in
Onslow-avenue. The rooms were filled
with the scent and beauty of roses, blue-
and-gold irises, yellow broom and hippe-
astrums. The hostess’s mauve georgettes
were woven with a silver thread, and
Lady Game wore green shoes and green
flowers with her grey laces. Law and
the Navy were well represented, and
among the notables were Sir Nevile Wil-
kinson with Lady Beatrix and daughter
Gwendolen.
Here is “Teddy” Roberson, third
daughter of Captain and Mrs. P. J.
Roberson, of Cremorne. Audrey, to
give her the name her godparents spon-
sored, is keen on tennis, golf and swim-
ming, but her favorite sport is fishing,
and fishing for flying-fish at that. This
she used to do in her school holidays
when she went back to her home at
Nauru Island, where her father was sta-
tioned. A party would go out on a very
dark night, and natives would hold aloft
(laming torches of cocoanut-palm. The
fish, attracted by the glare, would rise
and fly towards the boat. Then the
fishers would swoop their nets (very like
butterfly-nets) and gel a haul. The fish,
if not there and then cooked for supper,
were next morning fried and eaten for
breakfast. George Johnston made the
picture.
The doors of the United Services Insti-
tution in Young-street were thrown open
in honor of Admiral Upham, Captain
Nimitz and the officers of the U.S.
cruiser Augusta. Here there were bowls
of red roses, and downstairs in the
museum there were two very old new
acquisitions to be admired. One, now
framing the doorway, is of red lacquer,
with much carving and gold ; -the other
is a carved piece of birds, flowers and
leaves which would make an enviable
head-piece for an old mirror. These
were brought from China by Rear-
Admiral Feakes and his wife, and given
by them to the institution. President
Brig. A. J. Mills being away in Canberra,
Capt. Pope and Mrs. Pope, she in brown
laces, did the honors. Mrs. Alfred Spain
brought her Colonel and an admirable
combination of black satin and ninon to
the party. Mrs. Mills’s black nets ran
to frills at the hem. Mrs. Randle Ford
brought her niece Margaret Forbes in
ice-blue georgette. Commander C. W.
Stevens’s wife’s beige georgette sported
a cowl neck.
Admiral Upham, Captain C. W.
Nimitz and a party of the officers, all
a-glister with gold braid, dashed over in
pinnaces from the U.S. cruiser Augusta
to the party at Tresco. This was a late-
afternoon affair, and guests went on from
the reception-rooms to the billiard-room,
finally spilling over on to the verandahs.
All about were roses, syringa and golci
nasturtiums, and windows were flung
wide to the glory of the harbor. All the
Navy and his wife not already at the
centenary festivities came to drink a cock-
tail with the visitors. Knight Phillip
Street and his wife, the Mayoral Parkers,
Commander Gifford, the Harry Budges,
Mrs. C. L. Jones, the Brig.-Gen. A. T.
Andersons, Mrs. Tom Rolin, the medical
Walter Burfitts, the W. T. Laytons and,
of course, the American Consular Cald-
wells were others who were welcomed
by Captain C. N. Pope and Mrs. Pope,
who crowned her brown-and-white-
patterned crepes with a wide-brimmed
straw hat.
The U.S. cruiser Augusta was dressed
up with palms and bunting and twink-
ling yellow and red electrics for Admiral
Upham’s good-bye-to-Sydney party. Cap-
tain Nimitz helped in the receiving, as
did the U.S. Consular Caldwell couple.
Her gown of white lace gleamed with
silver threads. Our own Rear-Admiral
Ford’s wife rustled green-leaf taffetas,
and Lud Mayor Parker brought his wife
all wrapped about in burgundy satin.
Mrs. Roy Hendy glowed above rose lace.
Captain Pope’s wife trailed beige laces ;
Jocelyn Poynter and Judy Burleigh found
the hours fly too quickly ; Olive King
wore burgundy crepes, and on Mrs. A.
M. Doyle black chiffons bloomed green
leaves and pink roses.
Midway through last week Lady Game
opened the Arts and Crafts Show. This
filled the Education Gallery with cheer-
ful reminders that Christmas-gift time is
approaching. Eileen Palmer’s lino.-cut
of native bears and Mrs. Reydon’s hand-
woven bag in beige, gold and brown
stripes have found a home at Govern-
ment House. These caught the vice-
reine’s eye as she did the round of ex-
hibits. The speech of Sir Nevile Wilkin-
son, architect of Titania’s Palace, held
the ear, and it was particularly healthy to
note that this Knight of St. Patrick is
not too proud to own to the designing
of a trade-mark and jam-pot labels for
Whiteley’s, of London, and a cheque-book
cover for the Bank of Ireland. Lady
Game’s white frock with its black polka
dots kept company on the platform with
Lady Beatrix Wilkinson’s gold-and-silver-
patterned chiffons and the leaf-green
piques of poetess Dorothea Mackellar,
now a vice-president of the society.
Male supports were Norman Carter and
Librarian Ifould. President Florence
Sulman exulted over the growing interest
in all craftwork, and later her black-and-
white frock and millinery led the official
party to the tea-tables. Rhoda Wager’s
hand-wrought jewellery won vice-presi-
dent Ifould’s prize for the best exhibit.
There were so many salutes fired dur-
ing the week-end that residents of the
waterfront got quite excited. The
Armando Diaz got in after sunset on
Friday, after which hour salutes are not
fired, so it' was on Saturday morning
that 21 guns boomed out in honor of
our flag, St. George’s Heights returning
the compliment with the same number.
Then Italy must honor Admiral Upham’s
flag with 17, which in turn had to be
returned. Later in the day the Italian
Consul’s visit to the cruiser was acknow-
ledged by 11. On Sunday morning 21
more shots boomed out (this time to
honor France’s Day).
After all the courtesy calls had been
made and returned, the Commander,
Captain lachino, and his officers found
themselves the guests of the Italian Con-
sular Ferrante couple at Wyldefel. From
the lawns below the verandahs, sailors
from the cruiser sang for the entertain-
ment of all, and at sundown, before the
party ended, the Italian flag was lowered
from the mast in the garden.
The Orford and the Barrabool slipped
between the Heads about the same time
on Thursday morning, and, although the
Orford grabbed all the cheers and
applause owing to tennis player Joan
Hartigan being among her cargo, the
Barrabool snared the doctor first. The
two were moored almost alongside each
other, and Barraboolites were full of
surmise at seeing the yellow flag hoisted
on the other ship, not realising that the
same flag (it’s the medical inspector’s
signal) was flying above their own heads.


THE holiday of a lifetime—enjoy it,

Melbourne Centenary. Nothing like

Chatter
When the Duke, at Canberra, expressed
his admiration for Australia’s glorious
climate, Louis McCubbin and the hun-
dreds of people concerned in the Pageant
of Flowers begged to differ from the
royal opinion. Pouring rain necessitated
the postponement of one of the most
spectacular of centenary fixtures to the
next day, which, fortunately, only looked
like rain. The Grenadier Guards Band
added to the attractions of the really
beautiful floats. Albury produced a
garden city with a wistaria-covered
summer-house and maidens reclining
among roses. Ballarat hitched its design
to a miner’s hut, Bendigo’s miners washed
ore under the shadow of a tree dipped
in gold, and the Mines Department, not
to be outdone, also produced dolly-pans
and the top of a shaft. Portland’s aris-
tocracy doffed belltoppers, and Flinders
covered its lorry (it was a puzzle to find
the driver) with a “wave” which was
breasted by a dinghy full of explorers
and wild-headed sailors. Moorabbin
planted a garden near a cottage with a
straw roof, and the Tramways massed
its flowers into patterns round gilded
Mercury wings. Vic. Associated Brew-
eries’ well-fed Clydesdales found them-
selves dressed up like peacocks with green
satin draperies and bows on manes and
tails.
Footscray’s mermaids steered four fan-
tastic fish through its Saltwater River.
A superb blaze of orange and red
swamped the Shell Co.’s float, and Box
Hill’s was heralded by a rising sun.
“Poultry” carried an enormous egg made
of white flowers, crowing roosters,
chickens, etc. (also floral). People chased
the model of the centenary birthday cake
to buy portions of the real thing. Odd
figures with long necks and enormous
carnival masks skipped about the tram-
line to the delight of the crowd, and of
course there was a Loch Ness monster.
He had 70 pairs of legs (human) shot
with spurs, a skittish tail which wagged
a Union Jack and a yellow-and-green
body.
The first ’plane to finish in the air
race passed over the line at Flemington
on a day of grey skies and misty rain.
Grandstands were packed, crowds stood
on the lawns, and many of the early
arrivals (they had camped on the course
all night) who hugged the fence along the
track were rewarded for their patience
by close-ups and handshakes. The red
’plane appeared out of the clouds, and
like a flash was over the course
and a speck in the distance. It came
back, circled once and swooped off
on its one good engine to Laver-
ton. Three-quarters of an hour later
two Moths landed on the flat with Scott
and Black as passengers. Only half a
dozen lads in Air Force uniforms were
out on the squelcby grass to meet them,
for the dense crowds did no poaching,
and stayed behind barriers. (At Laver-
ton they went completely mad, and the
Comet and its crew were only saved by
the brawn and muscle and splendid
curses of all hands at the ’drome.)
Fourteen troopers on grey horses
formed an escort for the open car with
two grubby, tired and unshaven aviators
perched on the hood. Both wore plus-
fours and khaki overcoats. Upon the
dais rigged up in the mounting-paddock
Gengoult Smith spoke an official wel-
come. Wing-Commander “King” Cole
came out at a run when asked to speak,
Macpherson Robertson’s speech ran to
several pages of foolscap and quantities
of poetry. It rained gently on his white
head and on the auburn locks of Brig-
General Jess. Prolonged cheering and
“For They Are Jolly Good Fellows,”
sung in all sorts of keys by different
groups at the same time, each a few bars
behind the other, added to the riotous
welcome. The Consul for the Nether-
lands, on behalf of the Dutch air co.,
handed a floral and koala-bear wreath
to the victors and also boxes (rumor
says they contained beer) tied with
ribbon.
The Dutchmen’s monster machine
swooped over the white line at Fleming-
ton at 10.45 a.m. the next day. A few
minutes later Parmentier and Moll, spick-
and-span in their blue uniforms, stepped
out on to the grass at Laverton. The
’plane was pushed into the hangar, they
vanishing with it for the formalities of
checking and weighing and examining
the seals of the engines.
At 1.30 p.m. Roscoe Turner, the dash-
ing American, in his breath-taking blue
uniform with glittering wings, his lion
cub (toy), lion-tail stick, Clyde Pangborn
and Reeder Nicholls landed from their
grey Boeing and disappeared at once be-
hind the locked doors of a hangar. The
Air Force had its orders, and was taking
no risk of a turbulent crowd getting out
of hand. U.S. Consul John Dye had to
prowl about like Public Enemy No. 1
looking for a keyhole or a fanlight, but
still had his sense of humor intact when
he got within handshaking distance of
his countrymen.
One of the most spectacular centenary
fixture balls will be the Aero Club Ball
to be held in St. Kilda Town Hall on
Nov. 14. Air-race competitors who are
available will be welcomed by the Aero
Club ; Navy, Army and Air Force uni-
forms will be worn, and there will be
official representatives present of many
nations. The G.-G. and Lady Isaacs
and Lord and Lady Huntingfield have
made a note of the date in their engage-
ment books.
Fraulein Thea Rasche, the only woman
passenger in the giant Dutch ’plane which
finished second in the air race, got her
pilot’s license in Germany in 1924. She
has since flown many types of German
and American machines, and while she
was in America in 1927-28-29 was a suc-
cessful competitor in races. Her job is
that of editor-in-chief for an aviation
journal published in her native Germany.
As her leave of absence is restricted, she
plans to leave Australia in a few days’
time. She speaks good English, and
wears smart utility clothes.
One of the most spectacular figures in
the International Club centenary pageant
was that of the Valkyrie, portrayed by
Mrs. Alstergren, who is tall, with a good
carriage and golden hair which reaches
her waist. The Valkyrie belonged to the
symbolical figures of the Norwegian
group, and walked with a Viking and
“Young Norway,” represented by Lief
Lie, son of the Norwegian Consul. Lief
carried a genuine Norwegian model ot'
a Viking ship, borrowed for the occasion
from the home of Mr. and Mrs. Alster-
gren. The Valkyrie’s portrait is by
Spencer Shier.
With symbolical pageantry Victoria
received congratulations on reaching her
hundredth year from the nations of the
world at the International Club Cen-
tenary Pageant. Producer Alfred Bris-
towe, group organisers and the hundreds
of people taking part worked so well to-
gether that the affair was one of the
most spectacular ever put on in the Mel-
bourne Town Hall. Each group walked
the length of the room before mounting
the enlarged 'stage. Victoria (imper-
sonated by Jessie Brookes) was sur-
rounded by Peace, Prosperity, Britannia
and the Australian States. The
Dominions closed up around her, to be
followed by groups representing 21
nations. Led by standard-bearers of
each nation were symbolical figures, his-
torical characters, groups of peasants,
dancers, etc., who, with very few excep-
tions, belonged by birth, marriage or
parentage to the country which they
represented.
In the Australian bunch were some
well-painted abos., explorer Leichhardt,
Eyre and his ragged Wylie and a
few early Governors. Among British
characters were St. George (without the
dragon), Francis Drake and Queen Vic-
toria (an extraordinarily clever likeness
of the plump little old hdy was achieved
by Dr. Constance Ellis). Behind the
pipers Kathleen Stobie was a regal
Mary Queen of Scots, and among the
wild Welshmen Robert Owen, as Harri
Tewdwr (Henry VII.), wore some clank-
ing armor. The picturesque Indian group
presented a replica of the Taj Mahal to
Victoria. From Malta came a gift of
a Maltese cross in flowers, and from
China a basket of tea. The symbolical
figure of the Chou Dynasty wore a gor-
geous gold-embossed facsimile of a philo-
sopher’s costume of 3000 years ago.
(How very unimportant is our State’s
100th birthday in comparison with such
age and culture!)
A small boy carrying a model of a
full-rigged ship walked with the Finnish
group, and with the Russians came a
quaint little youngster in a Cossack cap,
baggy pants on two thin legs, who carried
an offering of bread and salt. France,
Germany and Austria were all large and
spectacular groups; the Japanese and
their children looked like little butter-
flies, and in the Dutch group Mynheer
Graf, as Abel Tasman, wore a replica of
a Dutch costume of 1640. Denmark and
Sweden each produced a Viking, and the
U.S.A. sent Indians, Pilgrims, a cowboy
whose name was given as Yakima
Canute, George and Martha Washington
(Gaston Mervale and Mrs. Charles Hart-
man) and Abraham Lincoln.
Among people who were made much
of at the Canberra high jinks of last
week were Sir John Cadman and his lady,
who is pictured here by Broothorn.
Lady Cadman, who has a talent for the
right kind of clothes for every occasion,
has lately relinquished her seat on the
London County Council.
For the Mooltan Ball cars slid down to
Station Pier under Port Melbourne’s fes-
toons of colored lights to the waterfront,
where thousands of brightly-colored pin-
pricks and baby Venetian poles were re-
flected in the calm bay. It was a mild
windless night, perfect for a shipboard
dance, and the views from the top deck
were of a twinkling fairyland, with the
decorated city like a rainbow cloud in
the distance. On the deck used for danc-
ing there had sprung up young fir- and
gum-trees, and the committee brought
along loads of flowers to make festive
the length and breadth of the vessel.
There was a concert in the music-room,
where Lady Huntingfield’s party lin-
gered for a time. Amplifiers were turned
off on part of the deck for its duration,
and bridge was played in one of the
lounges.
Macdonald Hamilton’s C. R. Duncan
bought balloons from one of the maidens
selling them to match his wife’s frills of
jade taffeta. Mrs. Bill Johnston’s blue
gown had sprays of silver-vine leaves
creeping round its waist. Mrs. I. A.
Green was in floral chiffon, and Mar-
garet Raws wore yellow tulips on her
shoulder and backless sandals with her
leaf-patterned frock. Floating in Beth
Paxton’s wake were diaphanous chiffon
wings carrying diminutive pastel flowers.
Youthful newly-marrieds, the - Mac
Knoxes, were there, she in jade horn-
rims to match the color of the dress.
Blonde Marjorie James was in pink, and
dark-eyed Sheila Morell wore a Zulu-
brown cape over apricot. Dr. Norman
Deravin followed his wife’s red and
green sash across the covered tunnel
which transformed the gangway. Molly
McAuley got away from the usual run
of evening wraps by covering three-
quarters of her beaded frock with blue
and white checks. The first thing that
met the eye in the dining-room was a
lifelike salmon (which must have been
the inspiration of a beautiful fish story
for whoever caught him) resting among
decorative savories, some hams in fancy
dress, flowers and baskets of fruit.
One of the least informal parties to
which visiting naval officers have been
invited in Melbourne was Mrs. Ted
Dyson’s “Wig and Whiskers” dance, on
arriving at which the naval lads sub-
mitted to a growth of beard and side-
boards being attached to their faces. As
the evening progressed most of the men
present, officers and otherwise, discovered
that spirit gum was the medium of at-
tachment for the facial decorations, and
got rid of them without much trouble.
Mrs. Dyson wore a Pompadour wig with
a turquoise gown. There were blue wigs
and green wigs; June Dyson’s was pink
to match her blistered crepe dress with
its epaulette sleeves. Pat Henry lacquered
her dark head with silver, and Helen
Krcrouse sprayed hers with gold. Mrs.
Fred Rae’s hair disappeared under
powder known as “fire,” and Mrs. Flem-
ing-Dunstan’s vanished among fluffy pink
feathers.
An impression gained by officers of
the visiting warships is that Australians
don’t require any sleep, and that they
never seem to want to sit down and rest
their legs. (Explanation—dances that
proceed from house to house, and cock-
tail parties where no one thinks of sit-
ting.)
Melbourne has another “No. 9” —in
Collins-street, near Spring-street; there
Alice Wyatt has opened one of those in-
timate cafes and tearooms the demand
for which seems to be insatiable. In
London during the brave years Miss
Wyatt made her house a home for
Diggers and cheered up many a lonely
lad in hospital, and hundreds of former
A.I.F. men have joyfully renewed ac-
quaintance with her. She is a cousin of
Carrie Moore.
The Apollo was packed for the first
night of “The Valkyrie,” which opera
was something of an endurance test, for
the log table and benches of the interior
of Hundung’s dwelling came into view
soon after 7.45 p.m., and at 11.55 p.m.
flames were dancing round Briinnhilde’s
rock. The audience, possibly in view of
the length of the show, took precautions
against starvation; its jaws worked
solidly upon chocolates, butterscotch and
throat jubes, the aroma of which mingled
in some confusion with the perfume of
lily-of-the-valley. Thea Phillips, wrapped
in Sieglinde’s flowing white gown and
luxuriant tresses, and Walter Widdop,
wearing Siegmund’s sandals and tunic,
sang together with vigor, but embraced
in a lukewarm manner. Austral, as
Brunnhilde, waved 10 feet of spear in
the battle-cry, and negotiated the rocky
cavern’s treacherous steps with an arm-
ful of shield and a tunic of mail. Horace
Stevens, as Wotan, wears bushy whiskers,
an empty eyesocket and quantities of
bracelets. Hundung (Norman Allin)
peers out from behind a magnificent
black beard, and the fiercest pair of horns
in the show are attached to his helmet.
Muriel Brunskill produces Fricka’s con-
tralto notes from under the folds of a
grey cloak worn with a white gown.
Scenery behind the rocky mountains of
the Valkyries’ stronghold drifted by in a
series of ghostly green storm clouds.

Quality
The discriminating rifle-shot the
world over knows and appreciates
the value of quality, scientifically
designed breech mechanisms, high-
grade steels and well-proportioned
stocks.
The modern High-speed .22 Rim-
fire Cartridge has come to stay.
It delivers greatly increased power,
and demands greater strength of
breech actions if long service, re-
liability and safety are to be had.
The rifles listed below have all

From Coach
to Car . . ,
A 50-Year-Old Company that Has Developed into the Largest
Organisation of Its Kind in the Southern Hemisphere
Fifty years ago, before the crack of whip
and the beat of hoofs gave way to the toot
of horns and the purr of powerful cars,
Holden’s Wholesale Leather and Saddlery
business was started at Adelaide. In 1917,
when the firm was then engaged in making
horse-drawn coaches, the first motor car
body was built.
In that first year of production, 100
bodies were built. In recent years pro-
duction has swelled to over 45,000 bodies
annually for local use, whilst overseas
markets are also being catered for.
The main Holden plant at Woodville,
South Australia, covers 40 acres, including
1,000,000 square feet of covered space.
Plant and machinery to a value of over
£700,000 are installed in these buildings,
in which are carried huge stocks of Aus-
tralian timber, leather, steel, etc., and other
raw material. In all, more than £1,5 00,000
is invested in this plant, which employs
3,400 Australians.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Our social world is depleted by the
exodus to Melbourne, and those left
behind are mostly concerned in good
works. To aid the Minda Building Fund
the Kidman lady, assisted by a committee
of women, organised a large bridge party
which was held in the Unley City Hall,
when over 50 tables were booked.
Mrs. James Melrose, mother of the
plucky young aviator Jim Melrose, left
Glenelg for Melbourne to welcome her
son before she got the glad news that he
had reached Darwin.
There was a great crowd at the opening
of the Society of Arts Spring Exhibition
by Lady Dugan. She wore navy maro-
cain, fitting her slim figure, the cape-
sleeve effect edged with fawn fox-fur, and
a wide-brimmed navy straw hat. The
Melrose prize for figure- and portrait-
work this year went to Mrs. Everton
Shaw for a plaster cast. Mr. Wilkie’s
portrait-of his daughter was one of the
most admired exhibits.
On the same afternoon there was a
gift tea organised by the Hospitality Com-
mittee of the Victoria League, when
members were asked to bring gifts of
papers, magazines and books for dis-
tribution among settlers outback.
The response was splendid. Lady Dugan
was there, and music was made by Cliff
Lathlean and Spruhan Kennedy. The
stage was decorated with strelitzia, white
and purple irises and yellow broom.
Lady Dugan attended the social and
dance at Birks’s Piccadilly after the
annual meeting of the A.T.N.A. gowned
in white georgette, over which she wore
a coat of gold: tissue. There were about
200 present. Lady Dugan was introduced
to the members of the committee, and
danced with Dr. Wilson and Dr. Burston.
WESTRALIA.
Shakspeare Club members put on a
happy dance at the Pleiades Club, with
an offshoot for bridge players in one of
the reception-rooms. Secretary Kitty
Gillies pinned a spray of red roses to the
shoulder of her black satins, and treas-
urer Mabel Balding introduced touches
of tomato-red into hers. White cam-
ellias bloomed on Sylvia George’s Patou-
pink georgettes; Noreen Lewis splashed
gold matelasse with velvet; Laurel Berry-
man nurtured spring flowers on her soft
chiffons ; Ruth Robinson trailed a length
of cherry velvet, and Mabel Starr was all
shepherdessy in pink satins.
Van Druten’s “London Wall” was built
up by the Rep. Club for a popular season
in its theatre. Sec. Cyril Riley supervised
the construction, and Lesley Everett, Nell
Stubbs, Alex. Foster and Henry Cuth-
bertson were the biggest bricks. The
mortar was made with a mixture of Gor-
don Dean’s humorous Birkenshaw and
H. S. Bickford’s kindly-austere Walker.
Executive officers of the Karrakatta
Club poured out morning-tea for artists
and friends who had assisted with the
year’s social functions. Acting-president
Mrs. C. P. Smith parked her navy-blues
and field-flower-wreathed hat at the por-
tals of the ballroom and ushered the
guests into the maze of pansies, pelar-
goniums and pussywillow. Mrs. P.
Birchley, Mrs. W. E. Southwood and
Mrs. C. L. Mason assisted with the enter-
taining.
To swell the coffers of the Fremantle
Kindergarten, medico Percy White’s wife
lent her home for a musical afternoon.
Her lounge was filled to overflowing with
enthusiasts who loudly applauded Mrs.
W. Muir’s soprano, Flora Bunning’s
manipulation of the ivories and Nancy
Osborne’s wielding of the fiddle bow.
Shekels poured in for the Parkerville
Children’s Home at the bridge party held
on the Katoomba by courtesy of Mc-
Ilwraith, McEachern. Players piled into
the lounge- and smoke-room, and the
overflow sat on the decks, gaily bedizened
with flags and bunting. Tea was sipped
to the scent of roses in the dining-room,
where Captain Moodie-Heddle drew from
the hat Mrs. August Knapp’s winning
ticket in the hand-worked teacloth raffle.
Mrs. C. Heppingstone presided over the
doings.
Before her departure for England Mrs.
Douglas Gawler did a round of farewell
parties. Her maize radio-wave satins
stood next Mrs. Charles Lee Steere’s
burgundy laces at the latter’s bridge
party in her Peppermint Grove home.
Mrs. Theodore Ambrose brewed a pot
of morning-tea in her honor, and Mrs.
John Forrest sat at the head of a dinner-
table at the Esplanade.
Mrs. Max Rutter’s black-corded silks
and Mrs. A. J. Dimmitt’s grey matelasse
stood side by side when their wearers
jointly hostessed a welcome-home party
to Mrs. Norman Brearley. Morning-tea
was poured at the Green Gate, where the
guest of honor’s presentation roses were
held against a snappy jade-green woollen
sports suit.
TASMANIA.
In spite of chilly weather the southern
A. and P. Show was a huge success. His
Ex. arrived at noon ; Lady Clark opened
the women’s industries section. Tailored
suits were worn by almost all the women.
Ring events proved the great attraction
on both days, and Barbara Bennett on
Alert added to her many triumphs. J. N.
Archer’s team of horsemen, all in the
pink, was much admired.
A perfect day ensured success for the
opening of the sailing season. The
women judges of the most beautiful
yacht competition had their work cut
out. P. G. Coverdale’s Ninie got the
verdict.
The veteran steamer Oonah, of which
every Tasmanian retains kindly or pain-
ful memories, has run her last' trip. A
crowd gathered at McGaw’s pier,
Burnie, to wave farewell to Captain
Evans, to whom a send-off was given in
the afternoon. He has left for England,
and will bring back a new ship, Taroona,
for the future running.
Beryl William, of Bona Vista-road,
and C. F. M. Green, of Melbourne, were
married in Hobart. The wedding gar-
ment was of white satin, long and close-
fitting, with tulle veil and orange-blossom
coronet. Rita Grueber and Ethel Taylor
’maided in ivory lace and green sashes;
also green shoes, which gave them a lily-
of-the-valley effect’, further emphasised
by haloes of that flower.
Gundred, elder daughter of the late
H. and Mrs. Waller, formerly of Hobart,
was married a few weeks ago in Buck-
inghamshire to R. A. A. Young, Royal
Tank Corps. Sister Margaret( whose en-
gagement to George, son of Dr. and Mrs.
Stead, Hawkhurst, Kent, has just been
announced), Josephine Waller and 1.
Western were her ’maids. The bridal
gown was of heavy ivory satin with
touches of gold. The newly-weds will live
in Delhi. Mrs. Waller took her two
girls to the Cold Country a few years
ago.
Gwen Nicholas and J. M. Philp faced
the music of the Wedding March at the
Congregational Church. The bride wore
a straight-cut, long-trained gown of oft-
white satin with long, tight sleeves, and
her tulle veil flowed from a coronet of
orange-blossoms. Four ’maids, Jean
and Jessie Nicholas, Molly Nettlefold
and Betty Risby, were dressed alike in
ivory pin-spotted tulle with cape effects
and haloes of lilies-of-the-valley. There
were rejoicings afterwards at the Imperial.
Joan Scott-Power and F. A. Marriott,
son of Captain Marriott, are engaged.

BRIDGE
WITHOUT
SIGHS.
BY-
DR. H.L. TONKIN
There is one acknowledgment I omitted
in my last week’s notes on the inter-
state contests. At Howey Court, Collins-
street, Mr. S. N. Lythgo not only pro-
vided exceptionally fine premises for the
staging of the matches, but personally
supervised the conduct of all games. All
visiting players are indebted to him for
the courteous and skilful way in which
the week’s bridge was managed.
In contrast to the figures in the first
match against Victoria, N. S. Wales had
a slight lead at the end of the opening
session of 32 hands. The visitors showed
some good form, notably on hands 2, 5
and 23. The first furnished a game in
no-trumps which was played at three
clubs by the Victorian East. Hand 5
' gave a swing of 700 points for a vul-
nerable no-trump game on which the
Victorian North was defeated, and hand
23 was responsible for another 850 swing
to N. S. Wales ; it returned five diamonds
against the defeated three no-trump con-
tract attempted by West for Victoria.
However, to my mind, the most interest-
ing hand of either match was No. 11 in
this series.

Result, set one trick; 50 to Victoria.
Opening lead, spade knave.
The bidding in Room 2 was criticised,
and justly so. As the small slam depends
on two finesses, and North-South have
not shown any suit fit, the call is largely
a gamble. However, N. S. Wales was in
need of points to establish a useful lead,
and the North player took a chance.
It was then remarked that, had South
been lucky enough to get the club lead
which appeared in Room 1, he would
have won 12 tricks without any difficulty.
The declarer was also counted a bit un-
lucky in that both the club and heart
suits failed to “break.” Closer investiga-
tion of the hand, however, will show that
the contract can be got against any open-
ing lead.
Either an opening club or diamond
makes it much too easy. Let us take the
case of an initial spade lead.
The spade knave was led in Room 2
in an attempt to confuse declarer as
to the lie of the suit. This should be
won by South’s king. The natural play
now is to go for the clubs. The ace
wins the first, and when the 10 comes
through West is forced to cover or have
the suit run against him. North’s king
wins the third trick, the eight falling
from East. Seeing this, declarer should
suspect the worst and place West with
two more clubs. Hence he switches to
spades, running three rounds, on the
last of which West must discard.
Whether he drops a heart or a diamond
is immaterial. The heart deuce is now
led from North. If East plays the 10 he
is allowed to hold the trick. If the three
is put on then South drops the five, and
West’s nine wins. Whichever defender
wins it is their last trick. The best de-
fence for either West or East appears to
be to return the heart, which South takes
with the king. The diamond queen is
now put through, West refusing to cover.
South s knave of diamonds comes next,
and the ace wins in North’s hand. East’s
play to the remaining tricks doesn’t
matter, as the guns are trained on poor
West, placing him with two clubs and
the diamond king. A small heart lead is
won by South’s ace, and West must dis-
card. If he discards a club the last two
tricks are won by the knave and four
in North’s hand. If the diamond king
is dropped the 10 becomes good in South,
and the last tricks are taken with it and
the club knave. This is a capital example
of the “Vienna coup” ; more recently the
Americans have christened it “the
squeeze,” a baseball term. The play
depends on placing certain adverse cards,
counting the opponents’ hands and then
running some suit on which they have to
discard. Ultimately one or other player
is forced either to drop a winner or un-
guard an honor.
The “One Over One.”
This has lately become a sort of
bridge catchword. Dozens of players sit
down and glibly remark that they play
the “one over one,” possibly without
knowing or caring who is responsible for
the title. The idea, of course, is a natural
development of the “approach” prin-
ciple, which aims at keeping the bidding
low at all costs,, and is directly opposed
to the British method of calling some-
thing like the full -value of one’s hand
without trying to discover how it com-
bines with partner’s. Culbertson claims
that Theodore Lightner originated the
idea and the term. Hal Sims says his
whole bidding system has been formed
on it, and that he was the first to advo-
cate the principle. George Reith, another
eminent American writer and leading
expert, is equally positive that he dis-
covered the “one over one.” However
this may be, if the novice absorbs the
basic principle of “approaching,” that is,
trying to find out his partner’s holding,
then he is well on the way to mastering
the method. The objection is that there
is a grave danger of underbidding on
account of the weaker hand stopping or
that, on the other hand, overbidding can
occur from a player’s endeavor to “keep
it open.”
But when partners have learned to
assess their hands and to feel confidence
in one another, the two or three bids they
get in at a low level are a wonderful help
in arriving at the best declaration, nor
will interference by the opposition con-
fuse them.
As far as present experience goes, the
idea of the “one over one” seems
rational.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
C.M. (Kempsey, N.S.W.). —The opin i
ions accompanying any published hands '
are just those of the writer. You are 1
not obliged to accept them, but they often !
serve the useful purpose of starting an
argument, as in the case you mention.
Last Trump (Brisbane).—l am not
attempting to decry British methods to
advertise American bridge, as you suggest.
I deplore the slapdash style of most of
the British match players because I feel
sure that, with more constructive methods
Of bidding, the American team could be
well beaten.
J.K. (Sydney).—ln all the bidding sys-
tems the response of one no-trump is
regarded as nothing more than a cour-
tesy bid, made to keep things alive. The
opening hand should not credit respon-
dent with anything better than a king,
a queen and a knave.
P.W. (Parramatta, N.S.W.). —Plafond
is still apparently the popular game in
the French clubs. There seems to be an
aversion to American contract among
Frenchmen, although women are said to
be taking it up in Paris. M. Pierre Bel-
langer is the head of the French Bridge
Association.

THEY, being pestiferous and pertina-
nacious believers in perpetual
pedestrianism, had the audacity to
assert that I was becoming fossilised ;
that I badly needed change of scene and
air ; that urbanism, if ceaseless and un-
restrained, was vitiating—tended, indeed,
to undermine the most robust constitu-
tion until its owner became as spineless
as a slug and
as flabby as a
jellyfish.

lifts all day, they contended, helped,
metaphorically speaking, to hammer
nails in one’s coffin.
One of the healthiest men I ever set
eyes on, I told them, was a liftdriver.
“Ah,” they said, “that, no doubt,
was because of the way in which he was
accustomed to spend his spare time.”
Perhaps it was, I admitted ; and then
mentioned that he was accustomed
always to spend it in drinking beer.
These remarks of mine and many
others equally sage were, however, waved
aside or trampled upon as wantonly ir-
relevant. They quoted Borrow, Stevenson,
Thoreau, Wordsworth, Walt Whitman
and a lot of other eulogists of ouldoor-
ishness to me and kept it up until, in
sheer desperation, I said at last, “Oh,
all right, I’ll go with you then.”
AND so, at an uncomfortably, an un-
seemly and unnecessarily early hour,
as patient as a pack-mule and laden like
one with impedimenta said by them to
be indispensable, 1 met everybody at the
railway station, and we started. It was
a dreak and bleary morning, the kind
one would select as being eminently suit-
able for an execution—one’s own, or, if
one happened to be on the selection
committee, anybody else’s ; and, though
assured by my fellow-hikers that the
weather was ideal for anything in the
nature of a walking tour, I wasn’t favor-
ably impressed by the look of it myself,
and said so.
As I had left my umbrella, oil-
skin, sou’-wester and waders behind I
kept wishing most fervently when we got
out of the train that 1 had procured a
map showing all the caves and culverts,
railway bridges, viaducts and abandoned
tunnels ; all the discarded water-supply
tubes, hollow logs and rabbit burrows
large enough to crawl into. We had not
proceeded far before I wished 1 had
brought a fly-veil, a horse and cart and
some corn-plasters and bunion-ease as
well.
Wadding for the ears I regretted
having left behind, too, as it would have
enabled me to avoid listening to the
hordes of blowflies that attached them-
selves to the expedition and to the
uproarious and derisive merriment
of flocks of kookaburras. It would
also have prevented
me from hearing
the maddeningly
rei t e rated and
gloopish ejacula-
tions of feathered
clairvoyants who
can see at a glance
(a glance into the
near future) the
worst kind of

thing else at all un-
comfortable, bleak

proaching, and who
consider it their

warning the traveller, but to quench,
if they can, the ecstatic utterances
of such of their fellow-birds as can
see no further into anything than
the ends of their beaks, as it were.
THE illimitable gum-tree forest that
lined the track on both sides,
grimly, oppressively and drably
brooding, knew that we were only
traversing it supposedly for amusement,
in my opinion, and regarded our intru-
sion with hostility.
Just as I came to this conclusion my
foot was caught (intentionally) by a root,
lying in wait for
it across the
track, and I
crashed heavily,
barking both
shins and the
glass of my
wristlet - watch ;
also a sixpenny

ella in my hav-
ersack that was
wrapped up with
a package of
loaf-sugar, some
gingerbread and
a pound of
butter.
With less enthusiasm, if possible, than
ever, for the lassitude that began to
assail me before the hike commenced
really had now increased tenfold, but
with that determined air of accomplish-
ing something, I noticed my fellow-
hikers all had about them, 1 continued,
automaton-like and with praiseworthy
stoicism, to trudge along. I wondered
more than ever what they could see in
it, when suddenly the lowering sky above
us began to leak. Before long the cracks
in it widened, so to speak, and let the
water out galloniously, or, in other
words, in as lavish a way as one would
expect such a cheap and insipid fluid to
be strewn about.
Plootch, plootch, squeege, squelch,
gaily, so to speak, we barged
along. Before the slush of many
more dreak, blearisome and sog-
gish miles had been churned up
in our wake, as it were, the sole
of one of my boots parted com-
pany with the upper, and the
colors of the cricket belt I was
wearing soaked right' through
my white trousers and barbari-
cally bedaubed my skin. It
would take weeks of scrubbing
with sandsoap and turpentine.
I discovered later, to remove
those stains.
BY this time I was as devoid
of anything resembling
sprightliness, exuberance, vim
or joie de vivre as a bread poul-
tice that has been run over by a
goods train. Too much natural
antidote or something in my system pre-
vented me, apparently, from getting into
that state of exaltation or auto-intoxi-
cation likely to result, I had heard it
said, from unaccustomed freedom washed
down, as it were, with copious gulps or
draughts of undiluted rural air.
While we were crossing a creek the
imitation rope round one of my innumer-
“.. .crashed.”
able parcels
snapped, and the
contents, consisting
of biscuits, cheese,
self-raising flour,
insect icide and
rolled oats, hurtled
to their partial
doom ; and if one
of the unquench-
able romanticists
(there were several
in the party) had
chosen that
moment to quote
Wordsworth,
George Borrow.
Robin Hood or
any other eulogist
of outdoorishness
to me I’d have
slain him without
comp unction in
cold water and cold blood.
Not long afterwards the sole of my
other boot came off, and, as night was
getting ready to pounce upon us with
inconvenient celerity, we, or rather they,
commenced a belated and feverish search
for a camping site. The one selected in
the swiftly gathering gloom, when vari-
ous theorists had finished arguing (I had
nothing to do with it), beneath an over-
hanging rock, in a saturated, dank-smell-
ing, lonely and draughty ravine, struck
me as being ideal for the leisurely per-
“.. .the sole of my other boot”
petration of one of those hideous crimes
one shudders over in the papers every
now and then. I could well imagine, in
fact, the heap of drenched leaves I was
sitting on being marked “X” in the
photo, showing where the body was
found.

a leaky gate
THERE’S one easy way to end,
for ever, the trouble and ex-
pense caused by that old broken
down gate: Replace it with a
“Cyclone.”
“Cyclone” Gates are built to
eliminate ALL gate worries. The
Hinges for instance, are bolted
right through the post and can
never twist, sag or loosen.
The Chain and Knob Fastener
holds the gate tightly closed
always, even if the posts pull out
of true.
Frame and cross members are
electrically welded leaving not a
crack nor crevice anywhere for
wet to enter.
Neither age nor wear, strain nor
weather can harm a “Cyclone”
Gate. It is an almost everlasting
protection for your stock. Send

•THE evening meal (it consisted of cold
* food in various stages of sogginess,
wanly illumined by lantern light), though
wholesome, perhaps, did nothing to re-
lieve the stark and abundant dreariness
that enveloped everything, a dreariness
that could not have been rendered vocal
as well as visible better than by a couple
of curlews in some near-by morass
which, after nightfall, raised their lugu-
brious voices, doubtless with no other
object in view.
I, as one of those civilised and
sane —that is to say, comfort-loving—
persons contemptuously and erroneously
called “mollycoddles,” always by out-
door fanatics who
pride themselves upon
their inordinate capa-
city for living rug-
gedly (which, rightly
considered, is merely
a sign, of course, of
inherent boastfulness,
abysmal crassitude
and imbecility), failed
to see why a meal
like that, eaten with
the back- and foot-
ache on a damp
night out-of-doors,
was preferable to any
three-courses-for-nine-
pence banquet, with a
good roof over one’s head, obtainable
in lowly restaurants which cater for
people with large appetites but almost
invisible means of support. But if I am
unaware that I am a hopelessly prosaic
person it is not, I might add, for the
want of being told. ,
My feet, clothes, tobacco, matches and
mental outlook were wet; and a pain
where least convenient, ever increasing
in intensity, was, I discovered, caused by
a tick, which one of my companions, who
claimed to know all about the technique
of tick-extraction, singed and seared with
matches and a candle-end, singeing and
searing, at the same time, a large adjacent
tract of skin. He then obligingly pulled
the animal’s stomach off, leaving its head
and horns in the burrow it had begun.
I DRAW a veil over that night’s “waking
out.” Its debilitating effects were aug-
mented to such an extent by incessant hik-
ing next day (even wetter), and so blight-
ingly by crooning indulged in at exasperat-
ingly frequent intervals by mentally-de-
ranged members of the party, in a fruitless
attempt to convince me, themselves and
“....by comparison, paradisaical.”
one another that they
were enjoying the out-
ing inordinately, that
it was weeks before 1
ceased swatting imag-
inary blowflies and
crooners, could con-
vince myself that I
was not permanently
bedridden, and felt
that I could claim,
without fear of con-
tradiction, to be a
lit and proper person
to have his certificate
of legworthiness re-
newed.
So dire, indeed,
were these conjoint
effects that they were most helpful in
enabling me to come to the conclusion
that, rightly considered, the open spaces
are vast tree-, shrub- and rock-encum-
bered, over-foliaged and far too super-
abundantly aerated and moistened
wastes, chock-full of assorted incon-
venience, whereas the greatly under-
praised enclosed spaces, from which no-
thing less resistible than a charge of
dynamite is ever again going to discon-
nect me, are, by comparison, para-
disaical.
A Racing Yarn; Catchy, Unusual:-
NATURAL OBSERVATION
BY MARY GURNEY.
“There she is, leadin' on the rails, with
me huggin’ in behind her, an’ nothirt
much else near. She’s goin’ well, but
I’m goin’ better; but not all that better
— see? But I beat her,” says Mr. Dykes.
CCjT’S like this,” says Mr. Dykes, spit-
| ting on his hands and seizing the
body-brush. “I’d liefer train trot-
ters than gallopers, ’cause why? ’Cause
when I’ve trained ’em I can drive ’em
myself, and not have to trust to no
wooden-headed boy to undo in half a
minute what it’s taken me half a year
to build up—see?
“What I mean is, you put one of them
kids up, an’ he rides all over the place,
an’ then he can’t tell you anything about
why he didn’t win—see? Dumb, that’s
what they are—just naturally dumb; an’
if they ain’t blind they’re as good as.
’Cause they don’t see a thing what’s hap-
penin’ in a race—see?
“Boys ain’t what they were when I
was a boy meself,” says Mr. Dykes, paus-
ing to spit on his hands. “They ain’t
got no natural observation —see? There
was a time,” says Mr. Dykes, “when, if
I hadn’t of had natural observation, I
wouldn’t have been no better than you
are yourself.
«IT was like this,” says Mr. Dykes,
* throwing the body-brush into the
manger and seizing the dandy-brush.
“There’s a fella I knows, he has a little
shop—see? And he’s the sort of fella
a fella does well to hitch up with —see?
Straight, an’ keen to let a fella in on any-
thing good if the fella does the square
thing by him —see? So one time when
I was doin’ a lot of flat-ridin’ he says to
me:
“ ‘Well,’ he says, ‘can you give me the
double for Thursday?’ he says.
“So I tells him. ‘Merry Queen, she’ll
win the Handicap,’ I says.
“ ‘Yeah,’ he says, ‘an’ what ’ull win
the Cup?’ he says.
“ ‘I will,’ I says.
“ ‘ You ,’ he says. ‘Why, your horse
ain’t no good,’ he says. ‘Look what hap-
pened to him in the Stakes,’ he says.
“ ‘Never you mind what happened to
him in the Stakes,’ I says. ‘What you
got to worry about is what ’ull happen
to him in the Cup,’ I says.
“Well, Merry Queen, she wins the
Handicap all right; an’ I’m over at the
boxes, seem’ about Royal Dash for the
Cup before this fella 1 knows turns up.
“ ‘Well,’ he says, ‘that’s one leg in,’ he
says. ‘Now it’s up to you,’ he says. ‘lf
you get the other in,’ he says, ‘there’s two
quid on at a hundred to one for you,’
he says.
“So I puts me hand in me pocket to
give him the two, but he won’t take it.
“ ‘You get it in,’ he says, ‘an’ you don’t
need to worry about no two quid,’ he
says.
«U7ELL, 1 S ets t^,e °th er in, but I
wouldn’t of if I’d not have had
natural observation,” says Mr. Dykes.
“There’s only one other horse in it
that’s any way dangerous, an’ I hangs
in behind her, leavin’ her to make the
runnin’—see? An’ when we hit the
straight there she is, leadin’ on the rails,
with me huggin’ in behind her, an’ no-
thin’ much else near. She’s goin’ well,
but I’m goin’ better; but not all that
better—see? But I beat her,” says Mr.
Dykes.
“I beat her on natural observation-
see? We’re runnin’ on a right-handed
course, an’ the chap what’s ridin’ the
favorite, he’s carrying his whip in his
right hand—see? And I’m just thinkin’
I’ll have to pull out an’ go for it when
he ups with his whip—an’ out he goes.
Not much ; but close in behind him I
guesses he won’t have to hit her hard
to send her right off. So I waits ; and
half a furlong from the post he fetches
her another welt, an’ out she goes, an’
in I goes like a flash, an’ beats him home
by half a head. See?
«117 ELL, there was a steward chap
what was a decent fella, an’ after
the race he comes to congratulate me;
and he asks me how I did it, an’ I tells
him. An’ it’s well that I do, because this
is one of them stories that has a moral
what goes with ’em—an’ that ain’t noth-
ing to do with wimmen, neither!” says
Mr. Dykes, very virtuous.
“Well, this was another race, not all
that long after. I’m ridin’ a great, rakin’
seventeen-hand brute what has a habit

of borin’, an’ he takes some stoppin’—
see? Well, I’m on the outside when
we come into the straight, neck an’ neck
with a little mare that wasn't no more
than fourteen-two, if she was that. An’
there she was on the rails, an’ me along-
side her, doin’ me best to keep that
borin’ brute out an’ not check him, an’
there’s the boy on the mare, yellin’ his
—— head off, like I was tryin’ to ride
him off an’ put him over the rails —
see? An’ the stewards seen it, and they
heard the kid yellin’, an’ so they puts
me up.
“Yes, I won it all right,” says Mr.
Dykes, “an’ I never touches the ——
little cow ; but what does he do but he
ups an’ says I hit his —— horse over
the head! See? Well! Well—there was
a time when she did peck. She was that
close in to the rails —though, mind you, I
wasn’t pushin’ her —she hit her foot
against a post, and that near brought
her down —see? But the boy, he swears
I hit her a crack, an’ they’re all for put-
tin’ me out. They would of, too ; but
while they was debatin’ it I has a word
with the steward chap that had been
decent to me a while back —see?
“ ‘See here,’ I says, ‘ ’member me tell-
in’ you, after I won the Cup, how it
was 1 won it?’ I says. ‘Since then,’ I
says, ‘I ain’t never carried me whip
against the rails —see? There’s me whip,
still in me left boot,’ I says. ‘You ask
him which hand I hit him with,’ I says.
“So they asks him, an’ he says ‘Right!’
like I knew he would. An’ he stuck
to it.
“ ‘That’s funny! ’ says the steward
chap, ‘because his whip’s in his left
boot!’
“So, what with my horse bein’ so big
an’ his bein’ so small, they had to admit
that they couldn’t see what happened,
an’ that me havin’ a clean sheet, an’ this
other chap bein’ a natural-born liar, it
was most likely me that was tellin’ the
truth. .So they fines me ; but if I hadn’t
of had natural observation they’d of put
me out, an’ I wouldn’t of been no better
than what you are yourself,” says Mr.
Dykes.
Strong in Character, Uncommon in Theme:-
STONES
BY EDNA DAVIES.
Peter was obsessed with the idea that
they meant something. He was quite
uncanny about them at times He
had even made up fairy stories about the
wretched stones to tell Bob.
46IJULLO, P £ t e T still at them
ri stones?” called a cheery
.voice.
“Aye, still at ’em, Joe,” and
Peter straightened his back as far as pos-
sible and wiped the perspiration from
his face. “It’s a warm job.”
Joe Spinney laughed. “You’ll never
be cold then, Peter. Yer seem ter have
just as good a crop every year.”
“Not quite,” corrected Peter. “Last
year’s heap wasn’t as big as the year
before’s.”
“This year’s goin’ ter be less?” queried
Joe.
“I think so, I think so,” said Peter,
measuring the paddock with his eye.
“What yer goin’ ter do when yer fin-
ished all the stones on this side the
earth, Peter? Goin’ ter go and start on
the other side?”
“Mebbe, mebbe,” chuckled Peter. “If
I don’t work clean through first.”
“You’ll be givin’ those Frenchies a bit
of a start then,” roared Joe as he drove
off, thinking that Peter Bartch was get-
ting madder than ever.
Peter, as he bent again to his job,
spoke aloud in the habit of one much
alone.
“Joe always did like his little joke.
It’s a pity he wouldn’t pick a few stones
off his own land ; he’d be the better for
it. But it’s a job, it’s a job, an’ I must
have it clean when Bob’s ready to take
over. Won’t be long now. He’s sixteen,
and a fine grown lad.”
Then conscious thought faded away
into daydreams of Bob on the farm as
he bent and rose, bent and rose, mechani-
cally.
IT seemed to Laura Bartch that for six
months of every one of the eighteen
years of her married life, whenever she
had looked out of the window as she
went about her housework, she had seen
the same picture ; sometimes large, some-
times just a speck in the distance —her
husband, rising and stooping, rising and
stooping, in his eternal battle with the
stones which were turned up every year
by the ploughshares.
Stones! How she hated them! The
mere sight of a heap of stones on the
side of the road had always made her
sympathise with the pony, which shied
away from them. She often felt a wild
impulse to dash into the orderly heaps,
to churn the buggy-wheels round and
round in them and scatter them far
and wide. But Peter would only pick
them all up again.
And you couldn’t scatter them like
feathers for the wind to blow away.
They stayed. They were always with
you, stifling and stuffing you until you
felt that the very walls of the house—-
built with those same stones —were clos-
ing in on you, slowly, slowly, until
finally they would squeeze all the life
out of you, and you would be taken
away where more stones would be laid
on your chest, so that there was never
any real escape. Even the garden had a
stone wall around it, shutting them all in.
She had hoped that when the time
came for Bob to go away to school
they might' leave the farm and go to the
city to live, but that had not been pos-
sible. With wheat worth virtually noth-
ing it was as much as they could manage
to send Bob away. But he had gone.
Laura was determined that he should
have his chance away from the farm.
She wasn’t going to have his life bounded
and crushed by stones.
the last day of the school holidays
Bob had taken lunch out to the pad-
dock to eat with his father. Laura could
see them in the big paddock— two figures
resting side by side at a stone heap.
Peter was leaning forward and picking
up a piece of stone to show jhis son as
they talked.
She wondered what he was saying.
Some nonsense about the meaning of
stones, she supposed. Peter was obsessed
with the idea that they meant something.
He was quite uncanny about them at
times. She had no patience with his
fancies. He had even made up fairy
stories about the wretched stones to tell
Bob.
She turned away. As long as she
could she had kept Bob away from the
paddocks and the stones. They had
taken Peter from her. She would not
let them have Bob, too.
“They make yer think, stones do,
Bobby,” Peter was saying. “They can
talk, too. They often talk to me.”
“Gee, dad!” agreed the lad. “Bet
they can tell some tales.”
“Yes.” Peter nodded slowly. “Just
think o’ all the history packed inter this
three-cornered bit o’ limestone.”
“And think of the trouble packed up
in it, too, if it got caught in the plough,”
said Bob with a laugh.
Peter chuckled. “Aye, they’re a
trouble sometimes, lad. But think o’ the
trouble they must ’a’ been way down
under the sea before they was heaved
up an’ made inter dry land. Look at
the marks in that bit, Bobby, an’ the
little holes an’ hollers. I’ve seen holes
jus’ like that—only bigger, o’ course-
in the rocks at the seaside, with little
shells an’ things in ’em.”
“P’raps there were shells in these, too,
sometime,” hazarded Bob.
“Mebbe, mebbe. I like ter think there
was. It must ha’ been a long time ago
though, Bobby ; a long time. Why, lad,
these stones was here when the dingoes
and the kangaroos owned the land. See
that little mark there? Isn’t it like
the print of a kangaroo’s foot?”
“Gee, it is,” agreed Bob, delighted.
“An’ mebbe it is, mebbe it is,” con-
tinued Peter. “Made on the soft sands
of an early morning, lad, when this
layer o’ rock was just bein’ formed. See
this browny-lookin’ streak?” Bob

Bts Action Explained—
Simply take a teaspoonful of the powder or
two to four tablets in a little water. The
moment this soothing draught reaches the
tortured stomach it beginstosweeten thesour,
fermenting, undigested food. The contents of
the stomach become as bland and soothing as
milk to the sensitive stomach lining. The pain
quickly lessens and presently disappears. By
following up the treatment after each meal,
your harassed stomach will lose its tenderness
and grow strong, until you can eat whatever
you like and enjoy every meat, without fear
of wind and pain to follow. Get a bottle of
• Bisurated Magnesia; powder or tablets, from
the nearest chemist to-day and try it—the relief
will be a revelation to you.

nodded. “That’s what I always call the
‘abo.’ line. You can see it jus’ near
the top in lots o’ pieces. I like ter think
that was made before the white man
came to Australia, when the black man
hunted and fought and wandered all
over this old land an’ had things all his
own way.”
“It must have been made a long time
ago, dad, to be stone now,” ventured
Bob.
“O’ course, lad, o’ course. But the
black man was here a long time ago,
remember,” and Peter chuckled as he re-
sumed his picking, the lad beside him
keeping pace, until his father told him
to run off and have a last ride before
school took him away again.
TWO years later, Peter Bartch, as he
drove a load of hay in from the pad-
dock, was thinking.
“To-morrow Bob’ll be home, finished
with schoolin’. Wonder how he’ll like
takin’ on the farm. It’s clean for him
anyway. Surprisin’ly few stones these
last two years. He won’t be worried
much with them,” and his gaze wan-
dered happily round the paddocks, their
yellow stubble shining in the sunlight,
and in the corner of each paddock a
heap or two of stones.
Peter’s gaze lingered on the heaps.
Bob would be glad there were no stones
to pick ; but Peter wondered, a little
sadly, how he was going to fill in time
without them. He had spent many
happy hours thinking about them,
handling them, talking to them, friendly-
like.
808 had been home a week when he
startled his father by telling him that
he wanted to go back to school, to the
University, to study geology.
“Geology!” puzzled Peter. “That’s
about stones, lad?”
“Yes,” and Bob grinned. “I expect
you talking about stones and showing
me how interesting they were made me
take notice first. Then I started reading
them up a bit at school. One of the
masters has been to Central Australia,
and knows an awful lot about them. We
used to have some great talks. You’d
have enjoyed them, dad. Now I.feel I’d
like to go on to the ’Varsity and learn
all there is to know about them.”
“That’s a tall order, lad,” and Peter
smiled. “It’ll take a power o’ time to
learn all about stones,” and he relapsed
into silence, thinking.
“I’m afraid it may be a bit expensive,
dad,” Bob ventured at last.
“Don’t worry about that, lad. We’ll
manage. Somehow I’m glad that if it
can’t be the farm it’s goin’ ter be stones.
They belong.”
“I’m sorry, dad.”
“That’s all right, lad. I’ve always
wanted ter know about them meself.
I’ll be lookin’ forward to the holidays
an’ hearin’ about all the wonderful
things you’ve learnt.”
PETER BARTCH was loading stones,
murmuring aloud to himself as he
had always done.
“Well, Bob, lad. I’ll be glad to hear
all about the stones. Must be more in
’em than we know. I was glad I’d
beaten ’em .an’ got the land picked clear,
but now, these last two years, it seems
the land’s been missin’ them. The crops
haven’t' been so good, an’ the money’s a
bit scarce.
“Learnin’ about stones at that Una-
varsity seems an expensive business, lad.
But don’t think I grudge it —I don’t; an'
when you come home ter-night you won’t
know nothin’ about it. Bit of a joke
really, lad, sell in’ the stones I’ve been
years gatherin’ to pay fer you ter learn
about ’em.
“Looks as though they are enjoyin’
the joke, too,” he chuckled, “the way
they wink an’ sparkle in the sun. Mighty
interestin’ things, stones, though I never
thought you’d want ter go ter that Una-
varsity to learn about ’em, lad, an’ it’s a
sore trial ter yer mother. Both of us
stone-struck, she says.”
He pulled the pin out of the heavily-
loaded dray to tip the load, and looked
up the road for signs of the motor-car
that was to bring Bob home. A few
hundred yards away he saw a moving
speck. There was Bob! He’d soon be
home, and they’d have a great talk about
the stones. He’d done well, Bob had. He
was a good lad.
The shrill shrieking of galahs, startled
by a hawk, broke out behind him. He
turned, his hand still on the dray. The
horse started forward. Peter tripped
lost his balance, and the stones, winking
and glinting in the sun, crashed over
him.
When Bob found him his arms were
flung out as though to gather a last arm
ful of the stones, and he seemed to be
smiling as if he and the stones were
sharing some secret joke.
A Breezy, Light-hearted Sea Sketch:—
THE DIPLOMAT
BY E.R. RAILTON.
Within that hour he would know
whether the Dragon had forsaken him
—whether at the end he would be
a velly triumphant Chow, or a cold,
dead one.
A DIMINUTIVE Chow, with the
gravity of expression common to the
isolated Oriental stamped on his
broad Nankeen face, was Charlie Mo
Tong, cook of the cargo steamer Southern
Star.
Watching from the galley members of
the crew as they slunk about pretending
to clean winches and scrub the deck, he
felt an extremely miserable Chow in-
deed—miserable with the fear and appre-
hension of unknown terrors. He’d told
the skipper what to expect from that
mixed-up crew when they were signed
on at Alexandria. That peace-abiding
little man smiling him back to his steak-
and-kidney, and Trundler, the mate,
hunching his burly shoulders and clap-
ping bulldog jaws in defiance—that
wouldn’t save them.
A week out from Aden, the evidence
of hatching mutiny was only too plain.
Language needed no interpreting when the
men’s murderous intents were so unmis-
takably manifested in their faces and
actions. Of course, he could count him-
self doomed with the mate and engineer,
the only others to remain loyal to their
master when the former crew deserted.
LIE was gazing at the smooth, green
swells rolling over the skyline, when
a noise, as of a stampede close at hand,
almost caused him to cheat his enemies
of the pleasure of his green death. It
proved, however, to be Trundler blowing
up furiously from the lower deck, explod-
ing as he came. It was a relief to think
the mate had found out a little for himself.
A spasm of excited glee rushed the
Chow into the mate’s path.
“You find ’em si Clat-tat . . .
Hah-h!”
As he lay looking up at the foghorn,
he wasn’t sure whether a certain tooth
was actually on his tongue or loosened
in his jaw. Accepting the event in a
philosophical spirit, he lost no time in
creeping within hearing of Trundler and
the skipper.
“This mongrel crowd’s getting on my
liver! When ordered they stand and
gape like a lot' o’ netted fish! Just a
lot o’ yahoos!”
Charlie Mo crouched low behind a
large coil of rope. “Yahoos?” The
name seemed to suit velly well—flavored
of his own tongue.
He had a glimpse of the skipper look-
ing out at sea, as if he was trying to de-
cide something ; then the skipper’s voice
like a gentle breeze after a hurricane:
“But, Trundler, what was I to do.
loaded with perishables and”
A cyclonic blast sweeping all before
it: “That’s no reason why we should
let a lot of scum run the ship” ; some-
thing somewhere trembling with the im-
pact of the speaker’s fist.
“Have any actually refused duty?” in-
quired the skipper.
“None’s game to actually refuse, but
duties are not half done and I find ’em
playing cards in the fo’c’sle.” A terrific
pause. “Now, all I ask is permission to
deal with the cows in my own way.”

FOR WHAT PURPOSE
You may decide to buy, at some time in the future, an article,
the price of which precludes its immediate cash purchase.
It may be a piano, car or wireless set. It may be medical or
dental expenses, the cost of a holiday, the discharge of the
obligations of affection or friendship at Christmas or other
times of celebration, the higher education of children, the
inevitable demand of rates, taxes or insurance premiums.
Lack of foresight has worked great hardship in numberless
cases. The wise plan of saving weekly or fortnightly a small
predetermined amount will forestall all the worry and anxiety
that usually await the unready.

Charlie Mo felt an impulse to jump and
clap his hands. That great, hairy chest
with Herculean arms attached certainly
looked capable of crushing a dozen such
crews . . . unless! . . . and the Chow
cocked a rather dubious eye in the direc-
tion of the stokehole. Down there was
the burly German he’d seen put a 3cwt.
basket of coal above his head as if it
had been feathers!
The skipper’s reply had somewhat a
soothing effect on his thought.
“Well, Trundler, I wouldn’t advise
bluff not with a crowd of foreigners,
You can’t beat a little diplomacy, you
kn l ? w -‘” „
“Diplomacy” framed itself on Charlie
Mo’s lips ; it juggled before his mind in
syllables and finally lay hopelessly
stretched across his brain.
Consulting at length an old frayed die-
tionary among his belongings, he was
able, after much research and head-
scratching, to grasp the significance of:
“Artful management ‘ with the view of
securing advantages.”
Realisation brought him fresh excite-
ment—a notion of possibilities he might
even possess himself. If Trundler
couldn’t do something, perhaps he could!
IN the long night sleepless time rolled
1 through his brain like the ever-rolling
sea. A wind came up lashing the waves
against the sides. Listening to the quiver-
ing hull, he hoped, in the agony of
futile thought, that something might
come out of the great heavens to frighten
the demons out of the spirits of the men.
But even as he hoped the elements
abated. Then, as the ship tossed and the
propeller rumbled out of the water, a
voice, as that of his tortured master,
moaned out of the deep:
“Charlie Mo . . . Charlie Mo . .
think! Charlie Mo . . . think' . .
Think! . . . Think!” . . .
Once again he mustered up all the
powers of his poor, drowsing faculties,
and startled suddenly out If a half
dream! . . . The thing had appeared on
the horizon of his brain like the first,
hazy glimpse of land in the distance \
TDTTvrTATcr. is* . .
UNDLER had begun the morning m
real earnest, and it looked as if the
mate had the men in check ; but at eight
bells not a man remained at his post,
rhere was nothing else for it but for
Charlie to concentrate on his plan of
diplomacy. For the speck of last night
had grown, and grown till he was at least
sure of its substance, if only
Sinking into the fo’c’sle, he discovered
the whole crew playing cards—a blind,
of course, in the final stages of their
conspiracy.
He had intended moving among them
in the pretence of looking for something
he could not find, but a glimpse of those
half-dozen ominous-looking, jabbering,
gesticulating figures deprived him of the
necessary courage. He found himself
instead behind the pannikin-cupboard
near the hatch.
The German stoker was there laying
down the clauses of their plan in for-
midable gestures. The climax, Charlie
gathered, was to occur that afternoon.
Trundler was to be shot—the German’s
demonstration with an automatic con-
vinced Charlie of that. Then, when the
brutal fellow suddenly seized a diminu-
tive Italian, held him aloft as he might
a lifebelt and bumped him down on to
the table till his face was as pale as the
winter moon and his eyes were as round
as a fish’s, the sagacious Chow had no
doubts in ascribing the display as just a
little preliminary to his own apportioned
doom.

“What the hell’s name does this mean,

A FEW minutes later Charlie stood
gazing at the nucleus of the mid-
day meal on the table in front of him.
Seeming all at once to collect his scat-
tered wits, he began energetically to dis-
sect steak and kidneys, beat eggs, and
finally blend into his cooking the con-
tents from small packets plastered with
Chinese lettering, and giving out aro-
rnatic and mellifluous odors. They sug-
gested rare spices seldom used out of
Oriental kitchens, and flavored of the
eternal mysteries of the ancient East,
Nothing had delighted the cook more
than to see his master smack his lips at
the first taste of his national creations.
He didn’t go to any such pains of
preparing fare for the fo’c’sle. He stirred
their mess, thinking of his dream. The
Dragon’s blood! The Dragon that had
cast its spell over centuries. Would the
great power of China forsake him in his
hour of need?
He lifted a troubled face as if in sup-
plication, beseeching those powers to
move for him.
ONE bell echoed over the smooth, green
surface of the sea, the tone sinking
and dying into the breathless silence.
To the cook, to whom the silence was
broken only by the bubbling of pots, it
sounded like the first ominous note of
a death-knell. It would be an eternity
befbre he would hear that bell again—
if ever ; for within that hour he would
know whether the Dragon had forsaken
him—whether at the end he would be a
velly triumphant Chow or a cold, dead
one.
He had lifted a large ginger pudding
from the pot, but hadn’t wiped the sweat
from his face, when he was startled
almost out of his slippers by the sudden
appearance of a couple of faces round
the door. The pangs of the first shock,
however, were considerably assuaged
when he realised it was for the dinner
and not for him they had come.
After a few hasty mouthfuls of his
own meal, he threw down his fork. How
forbidding the silence!
Outside he felt a trifle freer. A haze
encircled the sea, sea birds perched on
the mastheads like dreaming phantoms
as the ship glided ever on towards the
haze. It seemed that every mortal soul
on the ship had fallen under the spell
of that phantomic hour.
He tried to think, but thoughts fell
back into his brain. For a moment he
stood, tensely immobile. Again it seemed
he was sending forth his aching soul
with the hope of soliciting the powers
of the Dragon.
Suddenly the silence was split asunder.
A roar of commotion arose amidships.
He crept forward with curious horror.
Trundler stood face to face with the
German stoker!
“Who you say you giff sea burial, eh?
I like to see you giff me sea burial!”
A mouthful of half-masticated kidney
slipped down Charlie’s throat.
The men were equally matched and
stood for a moment like a pair of game-
cocks trying to gauge each other’s
strength.
“I’ll throw any man on this ship over-
board,” the mate snarled.
With this the stoker hauled off, the
blow grazing Triindler’s cheek. Trundler
evened it with one on the German’s nose.
Then the real fight commenced —a pair
of hissing, jabbing, blood-smeared mad-
men rolling about the deck.
To Charlie Mo a horde of demons
had been stampeded in the air, seizing
and shaking him till his eyes were coals
of mixed horror and murderous intent.
He looked for a weapon of some kind ;
nothing offering, he rushed to the galley
to return with a long-handled pot.
The combatants were now on their
feet. A blow from the mate split the
German’s lip. Closing, they swayed
like masts in a cyclone. Down again,
both groggy.
Then, with a terrific effort, the Ger-
man wrestled himself on top. Sure that
his opportunity had come, Charlie Mo
took aim at the German’s skull and
brought the pot down with a triumphant
oath
Oh, whaffor! Oh, Clistian God,
whaffor!
His aim had been true enough, but a
quick reverse on the part of the mate
had exchanged the skulls, and the full
force of the blow was stopped by
Trundler.
Hazily, Charlie saw the stoker on his
knees trying to struggle to his feet. In
a flash of inspiration he crammed the
pot on to his head. It was a tight fit,
but the infuriated Charlie punched it
home ; and when the skipper and engi-
neer arrived on the scene with legirons
the spotted stoker was floundering about
the deck with Charlie clinging to the
handle like a bow on a pigtail.
The rest of the,struggle was brief ; the
German was shackled, the pot removed,
and the mate recovered his senses suffi-
ciently to inquire about the rest of the
crew.
All but Charlie Mo looked round with
apprehension ; he stood rubbing a bruised
part while a glowing smile lit up his
sweat-drenched face.
“Others too greedy,” he answered their
questioning expressions. “You come, I
show you.”
In the forecastle the rest of the crew
sprawled over their empty pudding plates
in attitudes of death.
“Poisoned! ”. someone muttered.
Charlie Mo shook his head wisely.
“No poison; I put Chinese dope in
puddem ; they dleam ; we no swim over-
board!”
“I found they meant business,” said
the amazed skipper. “Charlie, you used
great strategy.” '
“No,” affirmed the Chow in his wis-
dom ; “I use ‘diplomacy.’ ”

A century ago news of events in England was not
known in Australia until from three to six months
later. The fastest medium of overseas communi-
cation at that time was the Clipper ship.
To-day the news of the world is transmitted from
Continent to Continent by Beam Wireless in a few
seconds.
Public and private messages are flashed between Australia and
Great Britain and the Continent, and Australia and North America
via Beam Wireless in fractions of a minute.
A telephone subscriber in Australia, by means of the A.W.A.
Trans-Ocean Telephone Service, can gain immediate connection
and speak to any one of over 33 million telephone subscribers in
other parts of the world.
A photograph or drawing can now be transmitted by A.W.A.
