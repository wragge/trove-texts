The Red Page
May Sinclair
The one woman novelist of genius now
writing in English is May Sinclair. Her
progress from The Divine Fire to her latest
novel, The Three Sisters (Hutchinson, per
Dymock’n Library, Sydney), has been con-
sistently brilliant. She has, too, the univer-
sality of genius: none of her novels echoes
another; with each she breaks fresh ground;
and each —a distinctive mark of her literary
art —she envelopes in the right atmosphere,
tragic, ironical, romantic or realistic, and
keeps it in that key till the last page. And,
with the passage of the years, experience
has come, and her psychology grows the
more profound. In The Three Sisters her
atmosphere is consistently tragic. The
story deals with the interwoven tragedy
of three sisters whose destiny is bound up
with one man. Each loves him, for May
Sinclair has, of necessity, isolated this
family in a dour country-side, where
marriageable men are rare. This isolation,
this cutting off of all extraneous influence,
this deliberate selection of her material for the
creation of a work of art, is an artificial
expedient. Life is not isolated; there are
loose ends everywhere connecting no matter
what group of characters with the outside
world. The artist is compelled, in painting
his picture, in making his statue, in writing
his book, to select what to put in his canvas,
how many figures to take for his marble
group, what to contain within his book, and
rigorously to ignore what is outside the
limits of his picture, what connects his piece
of statuary with the world, what tentacles
life outside his selected group of characters
is all the time putting forth to grip them.
Life is loose, penetrating everywhere, a
mass of untidy loose ends, making of each
family a component part of humanity. An
artistic creation must be compact, held
together by itself, independent of all contact
with extraneous influences. The characters
selected must work out their own destiny by
their own efforts: accident, the incursion of
other influences inextricably interwoven with
their own —so common in life —are for-
bidden in a work of art.
«£*
In selecting her tragic key May Sinclair
is careful to give an adequate reason for
the isolation of her group of tragic per-
sonalities. She conveys the idea that this
artificial solitude was inevitable. The vicar
of this family of three sisters was forced
to come to this desolate parish by his con-
viction that his youngest daughter had
created a scandal in his former parish. He
deliberately chose this isolation as a safe-
guard for his children.
And the key is set in the first few ■ pages.
The three sisters are seen sitting in the
dining-room, doing nothing. “In their
supine, motionless attitudes they seemed to
be waiting for something to happen, to
happen so soon that, if there had been any-
thing to do, it was not worth their while
doing it.” And the thing they were waiting
for was, ostensibly, this: —
“Is it ten yet?”
“No.”
“How long?”
“Forty-three minutes.”
“0-Lord!” Gwenda laughed the laugh
of brave nerves tortured.
At ten o’clock Essy Gale, the maid-ser-
vant, would come in from the kitchen and
the Yicar from the inner room. And Essy
would put the Bible and Prayer-book on the
table, and the Yicar would read Prayers.
That was all they were waiting for. It
was all that could happen. It happened
every night at ten o’clock.
And then they heard the new doctor
driving past the vicarage. That was what
they were really waiting for.
Their stillness, their immobility were now
intense. And not one spoke a word to the
other. All three of them were thinking.
Mary thought: “Wednesday is his day.
Oh Wednesday I will go into the village and
see all my sick people. Then I shall see
him. And he will see me. He will see
that I am kind and sweet and womanly.
She thought: “That is the sort of woman
that a man wants.” But she did not know
what she was thinking.
Gwenda thought: “I will go out on the
moor again I don’t care if lam late for
Prayers. He will see me when he drives
back, and he will wonder who is that wild,
strong girl who walks by herself on the
moor at night and isn’t afraid. He has seen
me three times, and every time he has looked
at me as if he wondered. In five minutes I
shall go.” She thought (for she knew what
she was thinking) : “I shall do nothing of
the sort. I don’t care whether he sees me
or not I don’t care if I never see him
again. I don’t care.”
Alice thought: “I will make myself ill—so
ill that they’ll have to send for him. I shall
see him that way.”
jZ I
There is no need to detail the story. There
is not a superfluous word in the telling;
and May Sinclair’s knowledge of the pro-
founder deeps of the psychology —and the
pathology —of the sexually # starved virgin
is uncanny. She carries, too, her
story out to the bitter end, past the dramatic
climax —for dramatic climaxes are always
unsatisfactory; they are always followed
by the anti-climax of the descending cur-
tain. She shows the inevitable ending of the
passion that the man (married to the wrong
sister) has for the right woman: she shows
him growing comfortable.... and beginning
not to care. That is the grimmest tragedy
of all —to Gwenda. She could suffer and
be proud when she knew that her self-sacri-
fice had given the man to her sister, for she
still knew he loved her. But when she
found out that this thwarted love of theirs
—this modern rendering of Browning’s “The
Statue and the Bust?-’ —had ultimately to
come to an end, when passion dwindled
down into a placid acceptance of facts, that
killed her soul.
Though the interest is so skilfully centred
on the three sisters, their father and the
man, the other characters are just as in-
cisively drawn, and the background of the
moor is all through not merely an influence,
but the dominating element in the tragedy.
A novel for the tough-minded.
D. Egerton Jones, the author of that in-
teresting Australian novel, Peter Piper, re-
fuses to grow up. Her new novel, Time
O’Day (Cassell), is food for flappers. The
title is a silly, flapperish pun on the heroine’s
name. The story is merely three hundred
pages of the flapper’s idea of life, and the
flapper’s idea of life is Boys. From day to
day the heroine, Thyme O’Dea, sets down
her ideas of the men who flirt with her or
who love her, and apparently she finds plenty
to do one or the other. She belongs to a
big family, and details the flirtations of her
sisters and the married life of her particular
friends at the same rather wearisome length.
Dances and picnics and afternoon-teas and
tennis and motor-rides and “evenings” make
up the background of her life—a stage set-
ting designed only for the flirtations and
quarrels that relieve the tedium of her maiden
innocency. There are, however, plenty of
things more exciting than “he said to me”
and “I said to him” ; for D. Egerton Jones
can contrive a plot, and it is admirably
worked out and cleverly led up to its drama-
tic “curtain.”
To the hardened reader this long record of
futile and foolish and flapperish existence
becomes dreary. But the thing is admirably
done—from the flapper’s point of view. If
D. Egerton Jones meant to set dGwn truth-
fully the flapper’s mind, revolving eternally
about the rather exasperating problem of the
male, she has brilliantly succeeded. Her
heroine would have written just so about
men, her views on life—that is, on Boys—
would have been exactly what Thyme’s views
were. As a piece of realism this novel could
not be bettered. And yet one cannot help
thinking that this is not at all what the
author wanted to do.
“I believe I’ll write down what happens
to me,” she confides in the reader in the first
line. “I think it would be fun.” Time
O’Day is fun—if you are a flapper, or are
interested .in flappers. And perhaps you
might be interested in the flapper’s opinion
of kissing? “I hate kissing, anyway; I think
it’s stupid. I only do it because men are so
crazy on it. I can’t see what there is in it
to get so excited about, but since they like
it so, and it doesn’t matter to me one way or
the other, it seems so selfish to refuse to give
them such a tiny bit of pleasure, don’t you
think? I don’t see any more harm in kissing
a man than a girl. It’s the way you do it
that makes it horrid or not. I never let
anyone kiss me on the mouth—l’m sure it’s
unhealthy. _ You know, I think there’s two
kinds of flirting: healthy and unhealthy....
I often think some of the minutes I most
like to look back on have been spent flirting
with a really nice-minded man, and likewise
some of the horridest have been where he’s
turned out to be a sentimental beast.”
Yet Thyme changes her mind when
someone “grabbed me to him so hard I
couldn’t breathe, and kissed me about forty
million times in one.”
When D. Egerton Jones decides to grow
up she ought to be able to write a fine novel
for grown-ups.
Australian Fiction
“I suppose I should have passed him in
the street in Sydney, or sat next him in
tram or ferry-boat a dozen times without
noticing him. I put him down as the sort
of precise man who always doubles up his
tram ticket and sticks it through his but-
tonhole.” He was an insignificant little
person, so ignorant of the rudiments of
travel that he went voyaging in the tropics
with no more suitable clothes than those
which he wore in and about his Woolloomoo-
loo grocery—this Grocer Greatheart (Lane)
with whom Arthur Adams sailed out of
Sydney Heads towards China and Japan, in
the unfortunate steamer Boomerang. A
very trivial, deferential, shy, obscure and
apparently harmless person. But Adams
was wrong. He was really a courageous,
romantic, chivalrous and lovable little fel-
low, with all the essential qualities of the
born leader, and if it hadn’t been for him
Adams would not at present be editing this
page, and this reviewer would not have had
the pleasure of reading a book which has
delighted him. The latter part of that sen-
tence is not written for the especial purpose
of delighting Arthur Adams. It is true.
The Boomerang probably struck an un-
charted rock of the sort that got the Quetta
and the AEI —although one of her officers is
at pains to blame the useful and übiquitous
derelict —and she went down nearly as
quickly as a passenger steamer does which
is struck by an unobserved Gerhog sub-
marine in the Irish Sea. Mr. Greatheart,
Adams, a pretty girl, an elderly one who
keeps a boarding-house in Sydney, a
dear boy from Oxford (Eng.), who is not
such a noodle as you’d suppose, and one of
the worst types of York-street “merchant
princes,” are the only people who survive
the disaster. It is largely owing to the
gallant efforts of the citizen of Woolloomooloo
that they enjoy this good fortune, and
eventually reach a charming island of the
sort you may often come across anywhere
to the north or nor’-east of this continent.
Here the story begins and the plot works
itself out. It is so good a story, and the
plot is so ingenious, that the reviewer, even
though he is being paid on space, prefers
leaving it to the enjoyment of the reader
rather than outlining it to any extent. Of
course, after the nature of tropical islands,
there is treasure buried in this one, and of
course the hero falls in love with the nicest
girl. Not the one from the Boomerang.
But there is one point to which the reviewer
must take exception. Why does not Adams
unite the hero and his girl in respectable
wedlock when he leaves them finally on the
island? He was at that time a sub-editor,
and sub-editors can do nearly anything.
In some respects John Greatheart
resembles Galahad Jones, and the books
for which they are the respective excellent
excuses have about equal merit, but of the
two one prefers Greatheart —very possibly
because one has a great liking for tropical
islands. There is much that is quotable, as
showing Adams at his best, but it is not
easy to make a selection. However, one
cannot refrain from this description of the
mysterious lady who owned the tiger and
the elephant. “Slim and indescribably
supple she was, her breasts almost _ boyish
in their youthful salience.” You will find
that she must have been just like that, when
you learn her age and her occupation. And
of journalists—“lf there are no daily papers
in Paradise the souls of all journalists will
troop to Hades, where there will be plenty,
with heaps of horrors to feature, an eternal
enemy to criticise, and no libel law.” There
are many good things like these. Altogether,
this reviewer reckons that Grocer Greatheart
is a jolly good book. He has read a better
one about a treasure island, written by some
Scotch chap named Stevenson —but this isn’t
bad. It is very often wholly delightful, and
you are sorry when it closes.
J. H. M. A.
More About it
That the barbarity of the German Hun
was premeditated and an integral part of
his method of conducting modern warfare,
damning evidence has been slowly accumu-
lating. But hitherto it has been inferred
from the actual atrocities. It has been
known that the military historians of Prus-
sia have suggested terrorism as a means to
victory, and that this teaching permeated
German thought. But the actual proof of
malice ; prepense has so far been missing.
Now r , in The German War Book, translated
by J. H. Morgan (Murray, 2s. 6d.) circum-
stantial evidence is in our hands. This
work is a literal translation of The Usages
of War on Land, issued by the Great Gen-
eral Staff of the German Army for the
instruction of German officers. It is the
most authoritative work of its kind in Ger-
many, and takes precedence over all other
publications whether military or legal, alike
over the works of Bernhardi the soldier and
of Holtzendorff the jurist. It is, even at
this date, a document of amazing cynicism.
Ostentatiously this text-book lays down
unimpeachable rules, and then quietly de-
stroys them by frequent exceptions. The
German theory is impeccable; but the text-
book lays stress upon the German practice.
The first principle of its authors is to “ter-
rorise” the civil population of the enemy,
to “smash the total spiritual resources” of a
people, to break their “spirit.” Whei*e there
is absolutely no excuse for German methods,
the official war book takes refuge in a
delightful German casuistry. It is noted
of certain crimes, such as assassination,
incendiarism, robbery and the like, “there is
nothing in international law against them.”
“No, indeed,” comments the translator.
“There are many things upon which inter-
national law is silent for the simple reason
that it refuses to contemplate their possi-
bility. It assumes that it is dealing not
with brutes but with men. A hostess does
not think it necessary to put up a notice in
her drawing-room that guests are not allowed
to spit upon the floor. But what should .we
think of a man who committed this disgusting
offence, and then pleaded that there was
nothing to show that the hostess had for-
bidden it?... .Can it be that this is why the
traveller in Germany finds everything ver-
boten, and that things which in our own
country are left to the good sense and good
breeding of the citizen have to be officiously
forbidden ?”
Let us note a few of the methods of war-
fare insisted upon by this official German
text-book. First of all, the only sanction
for the observance of treaties is “the fear of
reprisals.” The German tears up the scrap
of paper, provided the other fellow can’t hit
back. The German officer must “guard him-
self against excessive humanitarian notions,”
and must learn that “certain severities are
indispensable in war, nay, more, . that the
only true humanity very often lies in a ruth-
less application of them.” Belgium has
already experienced that only true humanity.
The rules for bombardment expressly deny
any obligation on the part of the German
for notification to the bombarded. “The
besieger will have to consider for himself
the question whether the very absence of
notification may not be itself a factor of suc-
cess” —otherwise, “humanity no doubt de-
mands such a notification.” If you can hit
a man when he is not looking, hit him—
otherwise you may give him time to put his
fists up. And when bombarding a fortress,
don’t forget to include the town full of non-
combatants. To spare the non-combatants
would “jeopardise the success of the opera-
tion.” And don’t let the non-combatants
leave the invested city. “The very presence
of such persons may accelerate the surrender
of the place.” And if you can take any
unfair advantage, if you find it advisable, for
instance, to employ assassins, to burn towns
or to steal silver-plate, don’t hesitate. It
is not verboten by International Law!
“Considerations of chivalry, generosity
and honor may denounce in such cases
a hasty and unsparing exploitation of
such advantages as indecent and dis-
honorable, but law which is less touchy
allows it.” Be indecent and dishonorable,
because the law has always assumed you
to be civilised man, and not gorilla. Also,
though the German officer is politely told not
to misuse the Red Cross, he is further in-
formed that “regulations of international
law to prevent and punish misuse of the Red
Cross do not exist.” Since there is no pun-
ishment for the crime, why hesitate? So,
when the enemy raises the white flag, “there
exists no obligation to cease firing immedi-
ately.”
“Though the majority of writers of all
nations are unanimous in condemnation” of
certain measures, such as the compulsion of
the civil population to furnish information
about their own army, “doubtless it will be
applied with regret, but the argument of
war will frequently make it necessary.”
So, “though every writer outside Germany
has stigmatised as contrary to the law of
nations,” the German action, in 1870, of
placing French hostages upon engines in
order to protect railway communications, yet
it was justified—because “it proved com-
pletely successful.” “To employ ruthlessly
the necessary means of defence and intimi-
dation is obviously not only a right but
indeed a duty of the staff of the (German)
army.” Private property, of course, must
be respected—except by the Germans. It is
true that in 1870 the German army sinned
openly in this matter, but they had every
excuse. Here is the official defence of plun-
der and destruction: “These did not occur
on the German side when they were not
called forth by the jbehavior of the inhabi-
tants themselves. They scarcely ever
occurred except where the inhabitants had
foolishly left their dwellings, and the sol-
diers were excited by closed doors and the
want of food.”
The text-book is, however, hardly up to
date. Certain paragraphs urgently call for
revision—those stating that protection must
be given to churches, libraries, schools, hos-
pitals, etc.; and those stigmatising as “crim-
inal robbery” the carrying off of personal
property. The Crown Prince has himself
shown how out-of-date in this respect is the
official German text-book of war. The state-
ment that plundering is wicked sounds
almost like Use-majest6,
Gregan McMahon admits that he is being
overwhelmed with Australian plays! The
Australian Drama must be doing very well,
thank you. He gets so much native drama
submitted that he cannot give it an expert
examination; so, in self-defence, he has
founded the Melb. Repertory Theatre Play
Agency, by means of which the reading of
Australian plays will be undertaken by
another critic. The name of that critic
ought to be mentioned for the information
of the playwright, especially as a fee is
charged for expert criticism. The best
plays will be submitted to the director of
the Melb. Repertory Theatre; in the case
of the others the author receives criticism
and advice. The fee for one-act plays is
21s. (if typed), or 31s. 6d. (if in MS.).
Longer plays will cost respectively 425. or
525. 6d. These fees will be returned plus
five per cent, of the gross receipts in cases
where the plays are produced by the Reper-
tory Theatre. Address Gregan McMahon,
Oxford Chambers, Bourke-street, Melbourne.

tradition for the conveyance of landing parties to and from
the shore. It is quicker, cleaner, less troublesome, and more
manageable better in a dozen ways. For the propulsion of motor-
launches, for the submarine, for seaplane, and for many ot.her
duties, only the very pick of motor-fuel is used in the British
Navy— hence the predominant use of

PEBECO
Tooth Paste.
There are sermons in stones—
also in teeth. We’ll choose the
latter for our text.
But if everyone used Pebeco
Tooth Paste there would be no
further need of sermons, preach-
ments or parables on the proper
care of the teeth.
Pebeco Tooth Paste solves the
problem by ridding the mouth of
the enamel-destroying acids. “Acid
Mouth” is the dreaded thief which
experts now agree is the cause of
95% of all tooth decay. Pebeco
Tooth Paste arrests this acidity of
the mouth—even destroys the
acid-producing bacteria them-
selves.
You have not settled the
problem of your teeth by merely
keeping them white, clean and
polished. Pebeco Tooth Paste
will SAVE them.

THIN WOMEN!
What is more pitiable than a pretty woman whose neck, arms .and
scraggy chest destroy her every chance of being really charming?
Nothing gives charm to a woman so much as does a full, Well-rounded,
perfectly-developed figure. If you lack it, science will enable you to’
obtain it.
WHEN you look into the mirror and your
hollow cheeks, thin neck and scrawny
• arms mock even you, what effect do
you suppose they have on those with whom
you mix socially?. . . .A woman's chief charm
is a well-rounded figure and full bosom. With
these, thin arms and hollow cheeks are a
rarity.
If your bust lacks development, and you
are scragglv and attenuated, we will advise
.you free and gladly as to how you may im-
prove your figure and beautify your bust.
We are only too pleased to tell you the
secret, for we know it cannot fail, and that
in a few weeks you will be happier, healthier
and more sought after socially than in your
present undeveloped, emaciated condition.
Thousands of women suffering the ravages
of ill-health have sought and accepted this ad-
vice, and to-day are models of womanly de-
velopment and examples of perfect health.
The same success awaits your call. In the
wake of attenuation follow such complaints
as constipation, indigestion, bilious head-
aches, internal functional derangements, etc.
As your development advances and weight im-
proves, these gradually disappear and perfect
health results.

follow the use of the treatment. SEND FOR

your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in

tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-

smoke, therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-

have every reason to believe were caused through the
use of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bygone Ships.
The sun goes down and a bugle cries
Across the waters a farewell note;
O'er the purple tide a seabird flies.
And a boy sings loud in a fisher-boat.
Like glad things given their rest at last.
The grev flags flutter “Good-bye,” and
fall;
The night-lights glimmer from bow and mast.
And an echo answers the bugle call.
The western sky is a sky no more,
But a sea all crowded with fairy craft,
That know no helm and that seek no shore,
But sail and sail with a fair wind aft.
An empress weary of too much light
And robed for couch —in a purple glow
The harbor lies: to left and right
The homing ferries run to and fro.
A fleet below and a fleet above—
And all things moving to one strange
bourne,
Perchance, in the end, to the Port of Love—
The peerless City of Glowing Morn.
Like one made rich by a lavish hand.
And dowered with splendor and joy from
birth,
I—born a son of this golden land —
Am proud of her —-proud of her glorious
worth.
Though darkness nears, I am swayed with
joy
That night and trouble may not eclipse.
I hearken the song of the fisher boy
Who sings a ballad of bygone ships.
The years roll back as his music floats —
A sweet-toned burthen upon the breeze —
And, somehow, a score of sunbrowned
throats
Seem singing a song of wild, salt seas.
The past unveils and the old ships rise,
With brown sails furled, and flags above —-
Their tall masts swaying against the skies.
The First Fleet rides in Sydney Cove.
The bds’n pipes and the sailors sing:
“Heave-oh! Heave-oil!” they sing and
haul:
And —just as to-day—the seabirds wing
In curves and circles above it all.

Roses Red.
It was a garden of roses red
But the moonlight made them grey;
And deep in the green of the dewless grass
Where reckless feet were too swift to pass
The warmth of a lost sun lay.
It was a garden of roses red.
And roses white were her breasts.
And a hot red rose was his kiss’s print—
()! Love will squander without a stint —•
In the curve where his dark head rests !
It was a garden of roses red.
And the shallow steps went down
From the guarded hush of a lady’s bower.
Who keeps a tryst at the midnight hour
Should go in a Quaker gown ;
Not a sheath of white caught with roses red
Where the shining shape shows through.
The wind blows high where the shadows
drift,
The lace on a soft breast it may lift,
And harry a ribboned shoe.
It was a garden of roses red ;
How they leaned to shelter her!
How they drooped the passion of each
sweet head
Over Love’s secret, grassy bed
To muffle the croodling stir!
It was a garden of roses red
And a bee-forgotten sward.
There may be dream in a drowsy rose.
But with moon so bright, would a man
suppose
That its hedge could hide a sword?
It was a garden of roses red
Where the sun looked in at day.
On a reaching thorn was a torn white shred
And on his cold cheek was a streak of red
Where Death had made it grey.

Concerning a Tin and a Goat.
The mountain side dropped sheer a. thousand
feet.
Beneath were stunted trees and waters
blue.
And on the giddy verge we paused to eat
Things out of tins as other wanderers do;
And there I wooed Jane of the sunny locks.
And threw an empty peach tin down the
rocks.
I saw the hollow thing bound and rebound
From ragged ends of stone that scarred the
cliff;
And idly wondered, when it reached the
ground,
Charged with the force of all its falling, if
It smashed a goat or made a rabbit lame
Or merely rolled in grass till it grew tame.
My heart was then particularly high.
And Jane had two soft dimples on her chin.
I heard her breathe three-quarters of a sigh,
And dropped a word as lightly as the tin
Down the life precipices rude and sheer
That started in the pinkness of her ear.
Rebounding from the rocks of years and
days,
The hollow thing seemed treble force to gain ;
For words and tins are like in many ways
As peaches that are eaten feel like Jane.
And that word, spoken when my heart was
high,
Fell till it struck a goat. That goat was I.

Mr. Walker, of Walkerville, came in from
his Jaunt Hot, Dusty, Tired and Hungry.
His wife coaxed him into a comfortable chair on the
verandah, and said :
“Sit there while I get you something to eat. I’ve got a
New Cheese here I would like you to try.”
“No, thank you, my dear,” said Walker, “I don’t care for
any but the real Dutch Cheese.”
“But try this new kind, please. I bought it specially, and I’m sure you’ll
like it,” pleaded the wife.
“Very well, then, trot it out,” replied Walker, feeling that he was immolat-
ing himself on the altar of self-sacrifice, But he was wrong. Ilis wife had
judged w r ell. It was
“REX” LUNCHEON CHEESE.
If you ask Walker lie’ll tell you “Rex” is the best Cheese he ever tasted.
Here is a Cheese made by a special process, which renders it easy to spread.
Its flavor is PIQUANT, and especially appealing to the connoisseur’s taste.
All the valuable properties of perfectly-matured full Cream Cheese are
retained in the manufacture.
It aids digestion—a little after each meal goes fine.

It is easy to apply, quick to polish, there is no
waste and it is economical in every way. Not
only does it give the utmost brightness to the

after breakfast. That is the difference
between savagery and civilisation. Human
progress is measured by the preparations it
makes and the plans it draws. The world’s
dreams are useful, its skill in manipulating
materials still more so; but these things are
little enough in themselves until somebody
sits down and works out in sober detail the
design that brings dream and skill together.
The plan, which is the essence of civilisation,
covers everything from the clothes we wear
and the food we eat to the trains that bring
us fo work and the houses we live in. Some-
where about there it fails —stops short and
begins to look frightened of itself. There is
a modern movement in the direction of town
planning, but very few towns are built upon
any plan worthy of the name. Here and
there a street or bunch of streets may be laid
out and built in a manner which suggests in-
telligent pre-arrangement, but the streets as
a whole are merely muddle limping painfully
after an idea. The thoroughfares grow hap-
hazard, and where they do not actually fol-
low the ruts of the old bullock-waggon they
generally represent the soaring fancy of
some ancient land speculator chastened by a
municipal council or other body. In the
making of some cities —notably in London
after the great fire, and in Sydney in the
days of its windmills—-there was a sort of
plan, but it was early mislaid, or the builders
forgot to look at it, with the result that, if
the bricks and stones had been shot from a
Zeppelin and built up into shops and houses
where they chanced to fall, the confusion
could hardly have been greater. The Greeks
and Romans knew how to design their towns
to a point, but the art was lost 15 centuries
ago, and to-day it is safe to say that in
spite of all modern efforts to make the
crooked places straight, there is not one city
on this planet which is built according to
intelligent plan from public cabbage market
to private wheelbarrow garage.
* * * *
bntside our towns things are a lot worse.
Nobody thinks that any design is necessary
for a State—that must remain as Nature,
with assistance from some politicians and
wire-pullers, made it. We design our houses,
lamentably for the most part, talk about de-
signing our cities, and leave the State to lay
jitself out without any hint or pre-arranged
‘plan. Yet the sequence of things should be
■exactly the opposite. No one can say what
the design of the city should be until the
design of the State is plainly before him, and
the attempt to design the city’s buildings is
an absurdity until the correct shape of the
city is known. The buildings of our Austra-
lian towns are erected as fragments of a city
whose shape is problematical because it is
itself a fragment of a State which is without
form or design. And they look like it. The
man who starts to nail together boards in
his back yard and does not know whether he
is constructing a wash-house, a dog-kennel or
a private picture-gallery is apt to achieve
weird results. The community which starts
to erect a city, and does not know whether it
is a trade centre for a hundred thousand
square miles of country or a temporary shel-
ter for a few immigrant mining prospectors,
is apt to make every street a misfit. The lack
of design for the State makes every other
kind of design absurd. Take, for example,
that slab of land lying between the 29tli par-
allel and the Murray River, which we call
the State of New South Wales. It is a
region of immense potential wealth, produ-
cing, or capable of producing, practically
everything that civilised life demands. It has
a considerable coastline, scattered along
which are a number of good natural ports
that might readily supply outlets for the
trade of the country behind. The site on
which to form a State is excellent, and all
that is lacking is something in the nature of
a design. At present in the whole of this
area there is only one city of importance—a
city which rose haphazard at a spot selected
for a penetentiary by people who had no idea
of the configuration or resources of the land
north, south and west.
* * * *
Had N. S. Wales possessed even the rudi-
ments of a design, there should have been
provision for a seaport at Coff’s Harbor or
thereabout, another at Port Stephens, the
present outlet at Port Jackson, a place of
docks, wharves and shipping at Jervis Bay,
and one of no less importance at Twofold
Bay. From Twofold Bay a railway and its
branches should have been designed to work
the rich Riverina country; from Jervis Bay
another line should have been planned to
gather up the trade of the land lying between
the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee rivers;
from Port Jackson the central railway sys-
tem should have been projected, taking in
quite as much country in its sweep as could
reasonably be dealt with through the Red-
fern tunnel; Port Stephens should have been
designed as the key to yet another system,
which would have served both the coal areas
around Newcastle and Maitland and the in-
land country back to Dubbo and Cobar;
while the northern harbor, whether Coff’s or
somebody else’s, would have been designed to
fit a railway working the whole top corner of
the State and the wide lands of the North-
West as far as Bourke or beyond it. The
plain trade advantage to the State of such a
basis for its. design would lie in the fact that
it would bring every portion of the country
as near as possible to its market, and enable
every settler to sell his produce in the short-
est time at the least cost for transport. In
addition to this, it would spread population
in a decent fashion, save one section of the
people from utter isolation and another from
lack of a back yard and decent air to
breathe, and generally make for real develop-
ment. Instead of one overgrown seaport, con-
taining two-fifths of the entire population, the
result of such a design would be the creation
of at least five large and healthy cities along
the ocean front in keen but friendly business
rivalry. Politically, that rivalry would be
the safety of the democracy, in that there
could be no special pull such as Sydney and
its congestionists now exert; and every city,
knowing the purpose for which it had been
laid out, might have arranged its own inter-
nal design in a way that would have enabled
it to go ahead and do things.
*•»*'*
All this is plain fact. Everybody who
has ever looked at a map of N. S. Wales
knows it. The real point that we are up
against—and it is as sharp as a Gerhog
bayonet—is.: What do we intend to do about
it? Politicians have again and again pro-
mised to open our ports, to re-arrange the
railways and to do all sorts of sane and
reasonable things, but their promises were
never seriously meant, and have always been
forgotten half an hour after they were given.
What we need is an attractive proposal—
attractive to the politicians—by which they
can be pinned down to the sadly uncongenial
task of keeping faith with the public. Let
us take a leaf out of the land agent’s book
of private devotions and see whether there
is not some means by which this can be
done. Those who run N. S. Wales want
money. It is their great and eternal need.
They have borrowed and cadged to the limit,
and the desire to squander more is like a
fever in their blood. Because there is money,
and a lot of it, in the land agent’s method it
should appeal to them with tremendous
force. At those points along the coast where
cities ought to exist the Government either
possesses land or can acquire it in its pre-
sent raw state very cheap, and an immense
value can be created for that land at practic-
ally no expense. Let a design of the reformed
State of N. S. Wales be prepared, showing
the positions of the new cities which the
Government pledges itself to found. Let the
cities themselves be designed and the railway
connections which will give them life be sur-
veyed and mapped out. Then let monster
subdivision sales be held and the leases of
allotments in the centres of future popula-
tion offered at public auction. The freehold
need not be disposed of, for under such con-
ditions either investor or speculator would
be glad enough to secure for cash a good long
building lease. In every lease sold the Gov-
ernment could guarantee that within a cer-
tain period it would (1). make the necessary
railway connections, (2) build wharves and
create proper shipping facilities, and (3)
erect the necessary public offices for a city
of first importance. Even in these hard
times it is safe to say that those building
sections of the first great subdivisions would
be rushed like hot muffins. Of course a lease
is only a scrap of paper, and the Government
might attempt to break or postpone its un-
dertakings even when signed and attested;
but a simple provision might be inserted to
the effect that if at fhe date specified the
vendors had not fulfilled their part of the
contract the purchasers would be entitled
to put a barrier across Redfern tunnel until
such time as it was fulfilled. The dread of
having the bottle neck of the Sydney rail-
ways corked would induce even N. S. W ales
politicians to keep their pledges. #
The opening of the closed ports of N. S.
Wales will never be much more than a pro-
mise until those ports are at least created
on paper. The cash to carry through any
great and comprehensive scheme of decen-
tralisation is wanting, but it can be
found without the assistance of Norton
Griffiths or Cohen. The people of the
State will readily enough find the money in
payment for good ground leases in the new
cities if the Government will give its guar-
antee to have the railways and wharves
built; and the rents to be collected should
make State Treasurers happy for a long time
to come. If Holman and Co. are at all
anxious about the welfare of the State they
can do a lot to lift the prevailing depression.
The building of three or four cities at one
and the same time would give a fillip to the
labor market and the eating industry which
both very badly need, and. Canvas Town
could be sold for old rags when its residents
discovered that they could earn bread and
butter beyond the congested areas. In the
meantime, to advertise the scheme, the Gov-
ernment might call for competitive designs
for the State of N. S. Wales.
A PARTY WITH ITS OBJECTIVE
ASTERN AND A PLATFORM IN
RUINS.
The N.S.W. political Labor party started
out some years ago hitched to a platform ;
and after wild journeyings by devious
ways to the pawnshop and back, it has
lately pulled up and turned round to see
what the thing looks like. The trappings
under which its stipendiary custodians dis-
guised the vehicle have been lifted to some
extent by the debates at the P.L.L. Con-
ference, with the result that the only object
to be seen is an affair which looks as if it
had been in collision with an earthquake.
Having inspected the wreckage the confer-
ence decided to damage it some more, on
the ground, apparently, that in a “time of
war” Labor platforms should be scrapped
along with everything else. By giving
approval to the Norton Griffiths project,
the Conference definitely pronounced the
platform to be a double-jointed affair that
may be turned back to front as occasion
demands ; or, if it be more comfortable for
the politicians in charge, taken to pieces
for the burial of inconvenient sections. This
Norton Griffiths business, of Course,
merely represents the Holman Ministry’s
final betrayal of its obligations to its people ;
the bolt from responsibility and pledge
has been continuous. Everything Ministers
should not have done these dreadful hum-
bugs have set about doing at the greatest
possible speed. The things they should have
done they have neglected .with a cynical
disregard of the consequences to everybody
but themselves.
* * * *
Battered and falling to bits though the
platform may be, the planks on which the
democracy of Labor placed greatest reliance
are still recorded on the printed page
to discomfit dishonest executors of the
popular mandate. Just now they are
well worthy of inspection. The objec-
tive of _ the party is allegedly the
same as it was in the days of sincerity
and strength, before a coterie of wirepullers
seized the steering-wheel. What the con-
stituencies that voted Labor into power
believed they had in view was “(1) The
cultivation.... and the development of an
enlightened, self-reliant community; (2)
the securing of the full results of their
industry to all producers by the collective
ownership of monopolies and extension of
the State’s industrial and economic func-
tions.” The only thing the Holman Min-
istry has done to “enlighten” the community
of N.S.W. lias been to show that a Govern-
ment branded “Labor” can be as great a
calamity as one of the most Tory descrip-
tion—that it can shuffle aM dodge with the
agility of a second-rate land-agent. And
when Labor in the mass comes to reckon up
its achievements, how much nearer does it
stand to objective number 2 —the one to be
secured by the collective ownership of mono-
polies and extension of the industrial func-
tions of the State? After five years of
magnificent opportunities and blither and
cadging of cash from Cohen, how many
monopolies have been brought under collec-
tive ownership? Not a monopoly! And if
it be said that there has at least been an
extension of industrial functions by the
State, does not candor compel the admission
that the exploits of the Holman Govern-
ment in this direction have been such as
only to bring public enterprise into the
gravest contempt—that its management has
Seen an unsavory mixture of muddling,
ineptitude and possibly far worse. In-
stead of standing like a lighthouse ahead
as an encouragement and guiding mark, the
objective of the party twinkles fitfully
through the gloom astern. The beacon in
front is the three-ball pendant of the mont-
de-piete.
* * * *
Plank No. 1 of the Fighting Platform, put
there before the party had unnerved itself
by drug-taking, provides for abolition of the
Upper House. The Upper House is still in
good working order; it has been strengthened
by the appointment of men who are not
pledged to vote for its extinction; and some
additional annointments are to be made
shortly. The Initiative and Referendum
planks of the platform have been eaten by
rats; and the fight put up to abolish the
office of State Governor —a costly figurehead
whose continued existence is a scandal —has
been so vigorously waged that no one ever
heard about it. Among the other things to
be fought for was “a proper system of close
settlement,” and the struggle has been car-
ried on with such success that the rural
population over a great part of the State is
going steadily downwards. There was also
to be a fight for the Nationalisation of Hospi-
tals. but it hasn’t come off. The State Iron-
works that were to be established couldn’t
be found with a microscope. On the contrary,
so satisfied was the keen G. D. Delprat,
friend of Ministers, that the plank was a
hoax that he recommended his great private
company to establish works: and the Labor
Government assisted him and it, though this
co. had just previously shut down its mine
for two years rather than obey an award of
an Arbitration Court. As for financial reform,
the apostasy of the Government is without
parallel. Not only has there been no “cessa-
tion of borrowing,” but the country has been
plunged into a series of loan transactions so
gigantic as to be without precedent in the
history of Australia. Of the tens of millions
spent, millions have been wasted, and the
aggregate result has been to tie round the
neck of the community a galling burden of
which Labor will itself, of course, bear the
greater weight.
LABOR 'S INVITATION TO FAT TO
ATTEND A BANQUET.
For its prostration before the privately-
owned money bag, symbolised by the Norton
Griffiths arrangement, the N.S.W. Ministry
has only one excuse to offer, and this is such
a bad one that it is doubtful whether even the
men who put it forward believe in its
cogency. They are really in the position,
these men, of opium fiends, so demoralised
by long indulgence in their vice that no
subterfuge, no lie, is too ignoble to use to
gain possession of the drug. They were
returned to Parliament to carry into effect
the policy of a party which viewed with
alarm the mounting up of the public debt;
pledged up to the hilt to abandon a disrepu-
table and degrading dependence on the foreign
money lender, and to pursue a policy of finan-
cial honesty and self-reliance; committed
without qualification to the sound doctrine
that the road to the pawnshop is the road to
disaster, and that the stern, duty oF the
people is to live on the magnificent re-
sources of the country by virtue of such
courage and industry and enterprise as they
may possess. And being thus returned,
charged with obligations of the most definite
character, they forthwith set out helter-
skelter in search of the Gadarene swine,
plunged headlong into a sea of debt, threw
their pledges and platform to the sharks,
and finally emerged, naked and shivering, to
beg a few old clothes and burst boots from
an institution they had once reviled as a
den of thieves.
* *- * *
Acting upon the principle of the man
who, having had a bottle of whisky
for breakfast yesterday, must have
another this morning or perish, Holman and
his friends, after their long jamboree were
seized with a great panic when war burst
out in Europe, lest the supply of loan should
be cut off at the meter. They had lived on
loans for years; therefore there must be
more loans, more debt, more waste, or the
bottom would fall out of their universe just
as their original platform had caved in at
the middle. By arrangement with the Com-
monwealth Government, which acted as a
sort of sponsor to Moses, they got hold of
seven millions to help save the situation;
and, of course, they set out to blew it as
speedily as possible. But with the same
insatiable thirst for loan as the dipso, has
for liquor, making him wonder in the act of
consuming one lot where the next
is coming from, the Ministry which calls
itself “Labor” commenced cabling to London
to know how much Cohen could be tapped
for at the end of the year. Being advised
that uncle was just at that moment rather
hard of hearing—the position on the Con-
tinent being one of extreme peril—Holman
hurriedly invited the Norton Griffiths
syndicate, which he had denounced when it
showed its nose on the premises a year or
so ago, to call round and have a cup of tea
with him. The rest was easy. Exactly
what took place is shrouded in mystery, but
it is known that an agreement was come to.
that the Executive of the P.L.L. breathed a
furtive benediction through the keyhole, and
as a kind of appetiser, or just for the sake of
auld lang syne or something, Norton Grif-
fiths and Co. were asked to take a snack off
a loan-renewal operation in the shape of
underwriting fees.
* * * *
The actual agreement perpetrated between
Holman and this syndicate has not yet been
thrown open for public inspection. From
what Holman has had to say, however, and
from the aroma pervading the atmosphere, it
seems something to be most comfortably
viewed from long range.- The ideaTs appar-
ently that the syndicate shall in the'first year
of its operations spend in carrying out pub-
lic works four millions, and a million and a
half in each of four succeeding years, making
10 millions in five years. The State is to
pay the salaries and passages of engineers
and supervisors appointed by the yndicate ; to
pay 5 per cent, on the total sum spent, i.e.,
10 millions, and interest at 4 per cent, per
annum on the cash the syndicate expends
in the aggregate. Also N. S. Wales is appar-
ently going to pay the syndicate 1 per cent,
underwriting fee for the money it will have
to raise by loan in London, and which it is
to be subsequently paid 5 per cent, for soend-
ing in the State. It all, therefore, boils
down to this, that Norton Griffiths and
Co. are going to float in London a loan or
series of loans guaranteed by N. S. Wales ;
that they are going to get a commission for
doing it, and more commission for spending
the loan ; that at the end of five years, when
the incubus is supposed to take itself off,
N. S. Wales will already have paid two mil-
lions for this 10 millions, and will go on
paying £400,000 every year afterwards!

If any more demented arrangement has
ever been entered into since kangaroos ceased
to visit Sydney Harbor, this paper hasn’t
heard of it, and doesn’t want to. But bad
as it looks on the surface, the innards of the
thing are unspeakable, for the hungry
monopoly is .going to be under no sort of obli-
gation to do its work on economical lines.
It is going to be in the position, not of a
contractor, but of a commission agent. The
more it spends on any given work so much
the better —for the syndicate. Also, so much
the worse for the community which will have
to shoulder the capital cost. No tenders were
invited to complete the works contemplated,
nor were any bids asked for the succulent
joint on which the peonle behind Norton
Griffiths are to gorge. Everything has been
done in the dark; and yet though every
known feature of the deal is inexpressibly
bad. though the transaction shatters Labor’s
ideals and programme and makes mockery of
all its protestations, the P.L.L. took the evil


thing to its arms, made friends of the
Mammon of unrighteousness, and by a
majority told Holman to go on with the
job. And it did this in spite of the
clearest knowledge that what it was doing was
wrong, and that to bolster up his case Hol-
man had presented certain alleged facts in
relation to finance which Prime Minister
Fishes denounced as inaccurate. The
loan-mongering disease has been responsible
for a lot, but there are not many people who
counted upon its ravages being so rapidly
destfuctive as is revealed by this record.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Keep Your Eye on the Tote Bill!
The promised attempt by Fakthing, M.L.A.,
to get a Totalisator Bill through the Vic.
Assembly will be more closely watched than
any that has troubled the Vic. or N.S.W.
Parliament in the past. All sorts of social
heads and representative bodies have declared
themselves for the clean, honest machine since
its previous appearance on the political stage
in Victoria. Of the members of the boss
racing club 95 per cent, have forced their
committee to ask for legalisation, with or
without the de-legalisation of the bookmaker.
The thing has got to be done, or a much
larger proportion of the community will want
to know what is the impediment. Thus far
the facts of the case have been little known
and only vaguely talked of. Opposition to
the tote was supposed to come from fatuous
wowsers, supported by blatant bookmakers;
but the relative strength of the allied forces,
and of the secret influences that operated
with them, was not in the least understood.
In league with Isaac McMoses are a host of
trainers, owners, jockeys and professional
sharps of the Turf, who get the cream of the
market whereof the public gets only the
skimmed milk. In touch with the wowsers
are some of the horseowners and club com-
mitteemen and their friends. One way or
other all these people are obstacles to Turf
reform, which is why the two principal States
have remained toteless, whilst the other four
followed the example of Maoriland. The main
difference between the two front fighting lines
is that the wowsers are soulful and prayer-
ful; the “books” are artful and ‘ square”-ful.
Ike McMoses is out for bribery and corrup-
tion, and the blessing of many bogus sup-
porters of the tote is upon him. He has
bribed and corrupted in the past, but he never
before had so much to bribe with as he now
holds in hand. A weekly war tax 's levied
<sn the “ring” ; also all outside persons inter-
ested in directing the flow of public punting
money to the bookmakers’ reservoir, rather
than into a totalisator, are cordially invited
to contribute to the bad cause. Secrecy en-
shrouds the details of Ikey’s “squaring” tac-
tics. Nevertheless, a good many people know
the names of the collector of subscriptions
and his co-worker who is supposed to splash
the money around. In view of the nature
of the conspirators’ campaign the urgent
business of everybody who wants the tote' to
be legalised, and who regards the Ikey Mo.
monopoly as a public scandal, is to watch
the opposition to the Bill. Roguery can be
prevented by vigilance.
Beer-sties in the Gutter.
As usual on Good Friday in Sydney, a
feature of the city and suburbs was the
beer-swilling parties on the pavements out-
side some of the hotels. By the grace of
the Licensing Act bars are permitted to open
for the sale of liquor on Christmas Day and
Good Friday, between the hours of seven and
nine o’clock in the morning, one and three
in the afternoon, and eight and ten at night.
But any liquor purchased must be taken off
the premises to be swigged at home, in the
gutter, in the park, anywhere. The most
popular spots, because the handiest, are the
pavements, gutters and right-of-ways near
the grog-shops. This, of course, is not the
fault of the publican, but of the fool Act.
Very many hotelkeepers prefer to keep their
bars shut throughout both days, in order to
dissociate themselves from the scandalous
nuisance. Spittle and spilt liquor defile the
side-walk; pot-house language and conduct
make disgusting the entire surroundings.
And in and out wander small children, many
of them girls, gleaning the dead marines in
the highways and sty ways—begging them
from guzzlers as the bottles are emptied, or
picking them up where they had been tossed
when drained. Attorney-General Hall has
somewhat •indefinitely announced the Gov-
ernment’s intention of amending the Act —
no doubt, in the direction of making
Christmas Day and Good Friday a close
season for booze in its native lair. Till
then the Licensed Victuallers’ Association
would be doing its people a good turn if it
induced them to keep the shutters up and
the bars padlocked during the permissible
trading hours on those days. Any un-
pleasant excrescence for which the Trade
is directly or indirectly responsible ohould,
in these ominous times, be hurriedly swept
into the ash-heap. For the trader in liquor
there is a heap of trouble rising all over
the world. And it is rising rapidly. It
reared like a pyramid of elephants when,
without argument, Russia’s autocracy cut
out the sale of vodka with a stroke of the
pen. Yet, since the system of distilling and
distributing the spirit under State control
was introduced in 1895, it was reckoned that
the deplorable abuses of Private Enterprise’s
control had been greatly diminished and were
certain to be eliminated. But, as circum-
stances fell out a few months ago, there was
no time to waste in persuading the devil that
consumed the Russian people through vodka
to behave himself. He had to be smashed
at a blow. And he was smashed. Then
came the blow that put an end to absinthe in
France; and since then the arm fighting for
liquor-trade reform has been whirling menac-
ingly from hemisphere to hemisphere. As in
Britain, the clamor against the business in
Australia and Maoriland swells daily; and
if Bung is overcome with a desire to encour-
age the attack, he couldn’t do it more surely
than by lending his patronage and helping
hand to Sydney’s Christmas and Good Friday
beer-sties in the gutter.
China’s Empty North—and Australia’s,
The problem of China’s empty North has
been solved at last. China, doing little or.
nothing with it, has lost control of it.
For about 700 years one Chinese dynasty
after another looked at the three fertile
provinces and was content to appoint mili-
tary governors. They had to be military,
for bloody raids and sudden death abounded.
Pekin was content to receive about 25 per
cent, of the taxes levied by the Imperial
satraps, • provided no troublesome reports
were sent in. Consequently the most suc-
cessful governors were those who bought
off the raiders and ran a small empire of
their own. Indeed, one of the men who
began as Emperor at Mukden became by
force of conquest Emperor of China. The
empty North was in general too far
away to trouble about; there were other
things to see to; and there was all futurity
ahead, anyhow. It wasn’t really a stark-
naked North, since it contained 13 million
people in 1907; but since it could easily
carry a population of 120 millions, it wasn’t
overcrowded. Pekin, however, did nothing
to develop its mineral resources, and
the soil, equal in fertility to any on
earth, has lain idle for centuries. Only one
thing China did: always she resolutely re-
fused to grant concessions in that part to
foreigners, because she vaguely hoped, when
the time was ripe, to develop the country
herself. No doubt it serves her right that
she has now lost command ; but the Austra-
lian -is the last person in the world who
ought to say so. Is our North not rich in
minerals? Is it not fertile? Have we not
appointed governors? Have we too not
made promises? And broken them? Don’t
we, also, intend to develop our North later
on? Is it not true even that the nation is
being asked at this moment to break a
solemn pledge about the north-to-south
railway? Are we any more invincible
than China that we can afford to scoff at
her because through procrastination and
neglect she has lost her North, which was
more difficult to deal with than ours? The
case is a solemn warning. Presently the
European war will have an end, and some
millions of men will be flung back on the
industry of an exhausted world. It will be
years before the industrial system of Europe
recovers. Why cannot Andrew Fisher
start to make ready? Private railway com-
panies in America have shown him how.
Let him build that north to south railway
to which the country is pledged and get busy
with land settlement. Give land to' the men
who can show ability to use it. They will
make the business for the railway, and if
alternate farms are reserved from settle-
ment for 10 years, these will acquire a
market value far in excess of the cost of
the line. Thus we may hold the North.
If we don’t do something of the kind China’s
new experience is merely another sign to us
that we shall either not hold the Territory
or only hold it after drenching it in blood.
From the British Medical Journal, con-
cerning a report made by Dr. Tacquin,
Physician-in-Ordinary to the King of
Belgium :—-
Mere murder is one of the lesser evils Belgium has
bad to suffer. “No amount of money can compen-
sate, no pity can console, those miserable women
who have not only had to suffer the horrors of
violation, but will, in some cases, see their agony
prolonged in the reproduction of the detested bar-
barian ; or will, in others, suffer all their lives from
the loathsome contagion thus incurred.” Again Dr.
Tacquin tells how “in a country house near Antwerp
the owner had done all he could to serve his hosts
with what they wanted. At dinner he was lashed to
a chair while his two daughters were stripped and
made to serve the dinner naked. When the officers
had done with them the wretched girls were thrown
to the troops. One committed suicide and the other
went mad. Now it is easier, perhaps, to understand
why so many husbands and fathers fled to England
with their woman-kind, fled anywhere to escape the
brutalities of these apostles of Culture.”... .They
still hope, they have told us recently, to dictate
peace in London next July.

“Foe” has a grievance:—
Providing he doesn’t make it the home of a glue
factory or a wool-washing works the Australian citi-
zen seems to have perfect liberty to misuse his
land in any way he pleases. Two months ago, in
our suburb, a triangular slice of flat, overlooked
by a high railway embankment and fronted by a
dusty line of second-rate villas, acquired a large
board which shouted at the passing trains: “This
Estate for Early Subdivision.” Next, the toiling
Chows who ran the place and supplied the district
with fresh greengroceries at a fierce Asiatic rate
were observed rooting up the water-pipes and tear-
ing down the weary old shanty that covered their
horses and carts. In a very little while the heavily-
manured triangle was a wilderness astride \yhich
the shouting advertisement hoarding stood like a
white-faced conqueror. The board now states that
it is a desirable and attractive block; also, that
early application will be necessary. But the dusty
houses over the way stare at the obvious lie and
say that they, too, have known land-agents. The
low-lying bit of flat was really only suitable for a
vegetable garden. If cheap houses are dumped on
it the inmates will undoubtedly catch the com-
plaints that are born of damp, and there will be
garish funerals and mourning, and little black-
draped expeditions will set out every other Sunday
afternoon to put fresh flowers on Cissy’s grave
which is one of the kindly barbarities of our white
civilisation. The land-agent, who is a money-
making machine without heart or imagination,
doesn’t see himself perpetrating these cruelties; he
is merely in the business to sell sand, rock or mud,
and he refuses to look round the corner at the
future or to consider the convenience of the present.
But there doesn’t seem to be any reason why land
should not be classified and graded by Government
experts, and the lots which are plainly unsuitable
for building on reserved for recreative or gardening
purposes. At a time when vegetables are a tower-
ing price, and white men are walking about looking
for work, it is lunacy to allow a flourishing cabbage
patch to be uprooted and handed over to the land
agent to play with. What this country very badly
needs to do is to think more of cabbages and less
of commissions.

“Quill” contemplates the S.A. elections
with a sour eye:—
If Representative Government is to be anything
but a dangerous fraud on the democracy, the Legis-
lature must represent the people with reasonable
approximation. Looking at the figures which dis-
close the recent voting in S. Aus., it is impossible
to come to any other conclusion than that, what-
ever else the new Parliament may represent, it does
not represent the popular will. Take at random
four electorates. For Albert, 2055 electors re-
turned two members, 1999 electors returned no
member; for East Torrens, 10,000 electors put three
members in, 9000 missed the ’bus; at North Adel-
aide, 5000 did the trick for two, 4000 voted in
vain; in Victoria, 5500 annexed a couple of seats,
5142 drew a blank. Add these figures and you find
that 22,555 electors pushed nine members into
Parliament to make law, or borrow money, or rat
on their platforms or do any other old thing that
politicians accomplish with so much dexterity, and
22,141 electors haven’t more representation than a
similar number of dingoes. Take the polling figures
over the whole State, and the one certain thing
sticking out from the depressing tabulation is that
a great section of the community hasn’t made itself
felt in determining the character of the Assembly.
A prejudice, not altogether irrational, exists against
electoral systems with frills on them; but if anyone
can show in few words that a worse method of
electing a Parliament could be contrived than one
which decides the issue on sudden-death principles
in two- and three-member electorates, the argument
should be worth printing.
♦
In spite of “never again” resolutions, patri-
otic feeds and leading articles, products of
German industry are being flung on Aus-
tralian wharves every day. All German
factories are not behind the Rhine; many
of them are in England, established there in
order, for one thing, to comply with Lloyd
George’s amendment of the Patents Act.
The goods turned out of these places, run
on German capital by German bosses and
often employing only German workmen,
qualify for preference under the Com-
monwealth Customs; for in terms of
the necessary declaration, all that is
necessary is for the article to “be
either wholly or partially produced or
manufactured in the United Kingdom.”
Thus even in the midst of frantic protesta-
tion from the pious importer that he will
only import the things his friends have
made, he is busy carting up to the ware-
house _ German-made wares, and the nation
is giving him special encouragement at the
Custom House to continue the transaction.
Perhaps Minister Tudor may think over the
question of adding to the declaration
required from importers seeking to take
advantage of the preference scheme a clause
setting forth that the goods were “manu-
factured in the United Kingdom by British
labor.” Meanwhile the blessed spectacle of
the importer, with a flag in his buttonhole,
hurrying round to get preference on a Hun-
made box of tricks, masquerading as of
British origin, is one of infinite pathos.
“Peri Winkle,” on the woes of the Vic-
torian irrigationists:—
Some of the poor devils from overseas who took as
gospel Mead and McKenzie’s yarns about the simi-
larity of the Waranga Basin storage and Aladdin’s
lamp, are throwing up their holdings on the Vie.
channel country in disgust. The failure of the Basin
supplies just when Fortune was due to smile through
the other fellow’s drought-worries was bad enough;
but now it turns out that there was ample water
in the basin —four miles long and over two miles
wide, and up to 10ft. deep—to have saved the situa-
tion if the engineering panjandrums had had the
gumption to get pumps going at the start of the
water famine instead of placing them in position
later on, when the settlers howled for them.
To the surprise of the aforesaid the
pumps started to fill the big Waranga-Mallee channel
in fine fashion, and by the time 16 pumps were going
it was running a banker, and settlers were giving
their cows a drink. Then Mead and co. awoke to the
possibilities, and gave settlers a watering for their
orchards. Next, it struck the experts that they might
also supply water for the famished lucerne and other
fodder crops. Now, when it is too late, it is
apparent to everybody that the Waranga supplies
need never have ceased, and wouldn’t have
ceased but for gross mismanagement and mis-
calculation. Unfortunately, the settlers have
lost the chance of a lifetime, and those who
have cleared out will take not only dearly bought
experience, but also an entirely wrong and highly-
damaging opinion of the possibilities of irrigation in
Victoria.
The British Columbia Government is send-
ing a Commissioner to Australia to tyy to
work some scheme of preference ' for its
timber imported into Australia; and to
put the side of the case which the Commis-
sioner may possibly forget to dwell on, the
Vancouver Trades and Labor Council writes
The Bulletin this way:—
In the first place, the majority of white timber
workers, those employed in the mills, have been
driven across the border into the United States to
obtain a livelihood, because of the almost exclusive
employment in the mills of this province of Asiatics
at wages no white man can live decently upon.
At present the timber trade of Australia is done
mostly in the United States, where the rule is to
employ white labor exclusively and to pay a decent
rate of wages. The U.S.A. have, apparently, been
able to hold the trade without any preferential tariff,
and to comply with the request of the British Colum-
bia mill owners and Government is merely to take
the work from whites and to transfer it to Oriental
labor, all under the guise of keeping trade within
the Empire.
This and further arguments on the subject
have also been forwarded to the Prime Min-
ister ; wherefore it may be taken for granted
that the Columbian Commissioner will be
invited to go north, ‘ see what effect the
abolition of the Kanaka had on the Queens-
land sugar business, and return to advise the
same step in the Canadian mills. After
which Australia may be prepared to listen.
The Party Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Party Man is really three,
And each of him is up a tree
(Of course the country’s treed as well,
But let the country go to H —l).
The Party Man, as No. 1,
He is the bulk, all said and done.
When brains were being handed out
He certainly was not about;
But he. is sly, and he is sleek,
Has triple iron-plated cheek,
Or, failing that, has influence —
The kind born of munificence.
But, anyhow, he’s evident
In every kind of Parliament.
And, when some patriot inspired,
His whole imagination fired,
Unfolds a grand, unselfish plan
To mould the Brotherhood of Man,
This dull-wit yawns behind his hand
(Of course, he doesn’t understand).
He rumbles from that pregna’nt room,
And, later, on his vote will doom
That grand design, that master thought;
“The Whip” has him his lesson taught:
“Mere sentiment. Besides, you know,
It wouldn’t suit the Party. So,
Be handy when the bells are rung.”
He was—and out the Bill was flung.
There’s some excuse for that tame tool—
He doesn’t understand, the fool!
Now, No. 2 of Party Man
Is fashioned on another plan.
His is a calculating wit
(I think I went astray a bit;
I should have placed him No. 1,
For that is how his life is run—
What pays the Party pays its son).
His vote defies the Manifest
If it’s against class interest.
The tyranny of Man and Life,
The needless tears, the endless strife:
'‘These are the things,” he says, “must’be ;
There can be no equality.
Survival of the fittest goes—
As every man of business knows.”
This is your woe, Community—
He snatches Opportunity.
That brings us on to No. 3
In this accursed trinity.
He daren’t sign his true name, or
’Twould read thus, “Judas, junior.”"
A hireling he, debased and mean,
Camp-follower of the Machine,
For scraps thrown by Autocracy
He stabs or sells Democracy.
Give him his wage, he’ll do the rest—
“A man must live,” is his digest.
These charges ’gainst the Party Man
Are not confined to any clan.
For Party known by any name
Comes but to this, “It reeks the same.”
One day all Party we’ll dispel;
Meanwhile, the country goes to II —1!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By the Old Road, lost in languor,
At that hour when life reposes
Drowsed in noontide, lay the lovers
Couched on violets and roses.
As he stroked her cool, brown tresses,
Bending o’er her full mouth’s sweetness,
Lo! it seemed there thrilled around him
Heaven and earth in all completeness.
Noons might pass and petals perish,
Violets shed their perfumes tender,
Droop and die; but love immortal —
Love should reign in lasting splendor.
“Woman,” sighed he, “woven, welded,
One in heart and soul forever,
Nought shall part us; nought above us,
Nought on earth us two shall sever.”
Then the Call came! Through the hushed
air
Shrilled a trumpet, strangely sounding—
Such a call as wakes the spirit,
Fires the blood and sets it bounding.
Then the host came, plumed and mighty,
Banners blazing, lances gleaming,
Like a tossed tide, golden-crested,
’Twixt hill’d shores at sunset streaming.
Sultans, Caesars, knights and captains,
Bound with bays and crimson-gouted,
Shut in armor, purple vestured,
Forward pressing, sang and shouted.
This —the army ! You —its leader !
Seeing him all life grows larger!
Robed in splendor, raying lightnings—
Glory on his battle charger!
Down the Old Road, where the lovers,
Couched on violets and roses
Watch and wonder, Glory passes....
And.... no more the Youth reposes.
Sounds the trumpet clarion, splendid,
Echo’d back by hill and hollow;
Glory calls, and all his being
Leaps up, shouting—“Lo, I follow!”
Then warm arms are thrust about him,
And his face is bathed in tresses
Cool and scented, and he pauses
Calmed by wonderful caresses.
“Hold me, fold me, soul and body;
Life is vain, a sterile story,
Lacking Love. Behold,” she murmurs,
“Am I not more fair than Glory?”
So she wins him, and her tresses,
Coiled about him. quell resistance.
Down the Old Road flaunts the hosting
Till it passes in the distance.
By the Old Road, lost in languor,
At that hour when life reposes
Drowsed in noontide, lie the lovers
Couched on violets and roses.
“Sweet, forgive, forget,” he whispers.
“One in heart, and one forever—
Nought shall part us; nought above us,
Nought on earth us two shall sever.”
Then the Call came, dire, insistent,
Like the voice of one who needed
Help in peril—sounding, sounding,
Till the startled spirit heeded.
Then the host came, solemn, stately;
Not with jaunty mien and nervous,
But like men who yield their manhood
To some stern and serious service.
Mute ; not singing songs of triumph ;
Forward, ever forward-faring:
Thus they marched with deathless purpose,
Grim resolve and noble daring.
Like a fixed star in the heavens,
Lighting night with quiet beauty,
Shone the face of him who led them.
Known and named and loved as Duty.
Down the Old Road, where the lovers
Couched on violets and roses
Watch and wonder, Duty passes....
And... .no more the Youth reposes.
Dire, insistent comes the summons,
Echo’d back by hill and hollow.
Duty calls, and all his being
Leaps up shouting, “Lo! I follow!”
But she clasps him, sighs and whispers:
“Hold me, fold me, flesh and spirit:
Am I not the fairest jewel
That a man’s heart may inherit?”
“Nay !” He breaks from her caresses ;
Thrusts her back ; her clasp uncloses ;
Follows Duty down the Old Road
Leaving Love among her roses.

Defence Minister Pearce lias a very im-
portant job ahead of him. It is to find out
whether it is unprofitable for an officer to
make a conspicuous success of things in
the Australian service. The training camp
at Broadmeadows—the most important camp
ever formed in Victoria —was far from
being what it should be. Then Major
Taylor was put in charge, and a rapid
improvement was observed by everyone with
eyes to see. Taylor, a permanent man
brought from Queenscliff, stiffened the
discipline—he was a youngster in the
Tlutton school —but set out to show that
discipline didn’t mean misery. It was not
a fortnight before the camp rose to the idea
and grasped it, and then the sailing was
comparatively smooth. But the change
meant a certain amount of limelight; and
it was Taylor’s misfortune that some of
it was naturally thrown on to him.
That seems to have been a mortal
offence. Had he done nothing of any
consequence; had he muddled along in
the old way, permitting “discipline” of
the sort which looks easy, but is shockingly
hard in the long run, apparently no one
would have been grieved. But because Major
Taylor’s record at the camp was so entirely
different, and because of the pointed refer-
ences to “limelight,” it seems urgent that the
Minister should thoroughly inquire into the
officer’s sudden removal and the appointment
of Johann (three other words to the same
effect) Kruse in his place. If Taylor has
been guilty of any real military or other
fault, well and good ; but if his offence has
consisted of a conspicuous success which has
attracted public attention —not, it is quite
likely, of his seeking—then the Ministerial
boot cannot come down too heavily on those
responsible for his sudden removal. The
Australian Defence Department cannot
afford to penalise success.
■
Significant statement made by Maori-
land’s Minister for Defence, James Allen,
last week :—-
I take it to be my business as Minister of Defence
not only to do everything l that is possible for the
Imperial Government at this time,' but to seel that
the defence of our own country is not weakened at
the. same time, so as to place us in an improper
position in case of an attack. I am perfectly well
aware that there is little possibility of an attack
just now. At the same time “a break away in the
North Sea is possible if not probable.” I have
quoted these words because they come to me from
my responsible adviser, and that adviser also warns
me that we certainly should not send the remaining
guns which are in Maoriland.
There may be nothing in it. Still it is worth
noting as a reminder, apparently necessary,
that we are at war, and that it is the busi-
ness of the German to do us—ms —an injury
if he can.

Echoes of a fierce cannonade have reached
the coast of Norway; and fishermen have
turned up with stories of a Hun-owned fleet
at sea. On these none too solid foundations
a circumstantial story has been built of a
big . fight between British and German
navies. The yarn may be true or not, but
up to the moment of writing the Admiralty
has maintained a vast silence on the sub-
ject. The reason given for the Germans’
sudden decision to use their ships is that
they desired to reach the Atlantic, evidently
to pursue unarmed merchantmen and
achieve great victories over fishing smacks.
It looks rather futile. In France desperate
fighting has been proceeding for weeks in
the Champagne district, but Von Kluck
appears to be still hanging on to the neigh-
borhood; and there has been hot work too
in the vicinity of Verdun, where, after an
exhausting struggle, the French have
achieved important successes at Ees
Esparges. Everything else is shrouded in
mist, the only certain thing being that
fighting is more or less continuous and that
the losses on all sides have been ghastly.
On the Eastern front the Russians are
slowly prizing the Austrian grip off the
Carpathians, the Bulgars and Roumanians
are ready to spring on someone or other,
and the Turks are having a sultry time
along the Dardanelles. Fresh naval units
have been hurried along, and are now
engaged in an endeavor to blow the whole
outfit thereabouts to the top of Mount
Sanai. Meanwhile the great problem of
beer hangs as a cloud over British politi-
cians,. most of whom are busy looking up
the historical attitude of the party-platform
builders in relation to prohibitory law.
Pub bars are not shut in S. Australia, at
six o’clock yet; and, in spite of the over-
whelming vote, the “reform” may still meet
with an accident. Certainly, both parties
are. pledged to give effect to the country’s
decision. But the Leg. Council is strongly
conservative, lias an old-fashioned restricted
suffrage, and is likely to argue that, if any
vexed question can be referred to an adult-
suffrage vote, with a pledge that the deci-
sion shall be carried through, its functions
as Council are cut right out. So a con-
troversy which caused more rancor, and
fury, and evil-speaking than any sectarian
feud ever did in South Aus., has still some
way to go before it reaches finality.

Melbourne Repertory TheSfre’s latest pro-
gramme was strongest at its two humorous
ends and weakest in its melodramatic middle.
“The Convict on the Hearth,” by Frederick
Fenn, is a droll tabloid story of a young
bloke wot has done a bit 6’ time in quod
and, returns ’ome to a fairly affectionate
muvver, a moderately forgivin’ farver, and a
bloomin’ old uncle as gives a festive air to
the family gatherin’ by bringin’ a fatted pie
to welcome the prodigal. Other members of
the family are two unlovely kids who wonder
where their bruvver got ’is ’air cut, a snivel-
lin’ sister, Jennie, who thinks her chap has
chucked her on account of George’s disgrace,
and that George’s donah has chucked ’ im.
There’s a young- parson who stage-manages
the reception, and supylies the harmless,
necessary beer, and a lady district-visitor —a
correct spinster who intends to present l con-
vict George with a copy of “Sesame and
Lilies,” but is dissuaded from her fell pur-
pose _by the practical shepherd. Also,
Jennie?s chap and George’s donah drop in to
show there’s no animosity, after all. Eleven
characters are sketches from humanity, and
the dialogue rings true. The piece is essen-
itally a good-hearted little thing. Moreover,
it is -vyell cast, every one of the Repertoreans

The Belle of the Circus —an old-time turn

to the type. Frank Keon, as George, gives
many touches of nature to his picture of the
bloke wot don’t want no more chokee, any-
how. Mrs. Fowler and Miss Cave-Brown
are a very satisfactory mother and sister;
McMurtrie is a capital parson, though a trifle
too seraphic in style ; and the only conspicu-
ous fault with the other people is that they
are too numerous to mention.
Pinero’s “Playgoers,” the third playlet on
the bill, is neither so naturally humorous nor
so easy for the Repertory Co. to present. A
shabby little' parlor-set does duty for the
morning-room of a London house where six
servants decline to be conciliated by a newly-
married missus. Her proposal to send them
all to the theatre once a week is rather
absurd, and her idea of summoning them in
a. body to hear the glad tidings is absolutely
ridiculous. The fiction is too transparent,
apart from the obvious falsity of the parlor
walls and furnishings. The servants look
their parts, and Tom Cochran is acceptable
as the newly-married husband; but Miss
Isabel Handley gives no stage realism to the
tony young matron character.

As for “The Taint,” by E. PI. Oliphant, its
first appearance on any stage will not mark
an epoch in the history of Ibsenic play manu-
facture. The truth is not in it. A crafty
lawyer of high repute receives a confession
of monetary difficulties and embezzlement
from his son, whereupon the impossible old
man tells the boy that his sainted mother was
a truth-loving harlot with a heart of gold,
whereas he (the lawyer) is really a cold-
blooded, methodical embezzler who has trans-
mitted dishonesty to his offspring, the boy’s
love of truth and fondness for the opposite
sex coming from the maternal side. C. R.
Stanford spoke the incredible lawyer’s lines
impressively, and ultimately committed sui-
cide after sending for a policeman to discover
his corpse. Lyle Christian was the. stagey
son who rolled his eyes in sad amazement
and occasionally answered back.

leaves about for idle rakes to woo. His
Majesty is a dreadfully wicked old dog, and
the strenuous struggles for his favors on
the part of frail ladies of his Court furnish
some of the minor pleasantries of a play
which, quaintly enough, trades oh its reli-
gious appeal. Onljy one of the
females, however, succeeds in taking the
royal eye, the others apparently being dis-
qualified by the deadliness of their dress-
makers. One of thg young persons, described
as a Gomtesse, seems to have chopped her
Court garment out of an old bed-quilt, while
another apparition in pink and green looks
like the end of a remnant sale.

Grade Grahame, the mildly-indecorous
warbler of years ago, is now at Melbourne
Bijou; but, judged by her Saturday pro-
gramme, she has become a specialist in songs
that could be sung with confidence at a
curate’s birthday party. McKenzie and
Guest, two newcomers, worry divers instru-
ments of music and noise, and get full marks
for their youth and refinement, though there
is a certain familiarity about their most suc-
cessful effects. The Bradnas, Albert Tou-
louse. and Smith and Barlee are as before,
but Irve Hayman and Co. have started to
put the kvbosh on the Kaiser in a crude,
corpse-laden episode, “The Beast of Berlin.”

In this week’s “Strollers” programme at
the Auditorium the energies of Sydney James
are rather more widely distributed than
usual. He holds the leading position in sev-
eral new items, apart from his latest conver-
sation with his minion, Billy, who does most
of the talking whilst they are together.
When they are not together Billy is as silent
as the tomb, and as useless as a Legislative
Councillor. Madeline Rossi ter continues to
be charming in several respects-—especially
feet and hands —-and Mena Brae, Gwen
Lewis, Desmond and the well-nourished basso
are all doing their respective dashes at
appointed times.

George Mozart, a quaint little comedian
with a large personality, has come to wake -
things up at Melb. Tivoli. This is the ninth
week of the Follies, and a new attraction in
the rest of the show was urgently needed.
Mozart is It. His word-pictures of Cockney
life are legitimate bits of comedy. Except
in his encore number, where he introduces
an assistant with a drum, his methods are
as unconventional as his smile. The Arco
Brothers, athletes, also came along on Satur-
day ; and the Follies transpired in much the
same old way.

The Naval Combat, at the Glaciarium
(Melbourne), has been considerably pulled
together and improved in matters of nautical
detail and lighting effect since the first show.
Some nights, when the enemy’s ships are
blown up with exceptional violence, the com-
bat can be heard in Swanston-street. Every
night and matinee the fortune of war goes
the same way. The Australian never fails
to win, and the last tunes the band plays
are invariably “Rule Britannia” and “Gor-
save.”

Adelaide Royal is busy with Gilbert and
Sullivan operas at the rate of three a week.
The men remain much as last year, except
that Walenn’s humor is more fruity, and
McKeown’s voice has improved hugely. The
feminine side is the better for having dis-
carded the mature heroines of the former
season. In particular,<.there is a welcome
for Gladys Monerieff, the new and brilliant
youp'g Australian soprano, who can also act.
The Tivoli goes strong with a lot of turns
new to Adelaide —the brisk Dooley and
Sales, contortionist Kingston, and quaint
comedian; Fields. It is a bright and well-
varied bill. The King’s is strong on the
musical side, with Ywaxy on the fiddle,
Westony on the piano, and Williams and
Warner on an instrument of their own
creation. Carrie Moore acts well in a
specially-written imaginative scene, and the
Newmans mix up cycles and boxing
effectively. The clever Dandies at the
Exhibition Gardens are beginning to bur-
lesque each other’s turns, a sure sign of
the end of the season; and, indeed, the
evenings are getting cold for outdoor shows.
Army pictures continue at the Town Hall,
but Pav., Wondergraph and West’s all find
the local Oakbank Steeplechase goes as well
as anything. - West’s is showing also the
Birtles-and-Hurley films of Australia’s fur-
thest back. Finally, a fine extra turn has
been put on at the Exhibition—a khaki
concert, . run by soldiers, who show an
astonishing amount of all-round talent.
The beautiful system of Party Govern-
ment received another testimonial in Vic-
toria the other day, when Mackey, member
for Gippsland, proposed that a special Com-
missioner should be appointed to ensure the
proper development of the district’s re-
sources. It is almost a pity the Cabinet
jumped on the idea, as with a Commis-
sioner for Gippsland, and others for the
biOrth, borth-east, Mallee. Wimmera,
Western and South-western districts, there
would have been half a dozen fat jobs
deriding the system which created them.
“Clinic”: “Frearson” (B. 8/4/’l5)
demands that chemists as well as doctors
shall be permitted to treat venereal diseases.
It is a dangerous howl. Every doctor meets
patients daily who bitterly regret not hay-
ing consulted the man who can “diagnose”
the trouble instead of blindly swallowing
the drugs of the chemist, whose diagnosis
is naturally only guess-work. All doctors
advise against marriage white- any trace
ot disease exists—bacteriologically. Chem-
ists are content with superficial naked-eye
appearances, and pooh-pooh the fears of
intending benedicts, who forthwith marry
and infect clean bodies. Doctors are not
all philanthropists, but most medicoes are
alive to the responsibility hanging to the
advice they give in this matter. With the
chemist, the transaction ends with a course
of medicine dispensed mostly on a verbal
statement by the patient. Even a physical
examination by the chemist is impudent and
worthless, because he has not been trained
to observe disease ; and he cannot tell safely
whether symptoms are well defined or not.
It isn’t his line.
Waimangu Geyser, which isn’t a geyser at
all, according to many authorities, has
started playing again in Maoriland. In the
few years it was active it made a name for
itself as “the black geyser,” the Johnson-
esqueness being due to mud. It, had a habit
of using great boulders as hair-pads, and
winding its wisps around them at a height of
300 or 400 feet. Then suddenly something
got into its throat, and what was Waimangu
became a sulphurous mud-bed. Now some-
thing else has happened—nobody knows what
—and the giant has started to life again. If
it had known what was expected of it it
would have made the move, not at the end of
the “season” at Rotorua, but at the
beginning.
Elated at his escape from being upper cut
by the P.L.L., the young gentleman who hap-
pens to be Labor Premier of N. S. Wales has
remonstrated with the “traducers of the
party,” and invited the world to witness how
happy and undivided the Parliamentary party
is under his leadership. It is, in fact, so
united that Stuart Robertson, despite the
Holman faction’s most vigorous wire-pulling,
ran within an inch of a portfolio against the
faction’s nominee ; and when the Carmichael
vacancy had to be filled, the Ministry found
itself only able to rush Grahame into the
hole with a majority of one.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Lauder, the last time he wrote to the
Taits, was about to do a three-weeks’ sea-
son in Glasgow at a salary of £1125 a week,
and the booking indicated that the manage-
ment would come out a’ richt, ye ken. The
Taits swear by Harry Lauder as a sympa-
thetic star. His first thought—after getting
his own guarantee—was for the welfare of
the management. If he noticed a narrow
fringe of empty seats at a matinee he would
anxiously inquire of the first Tait he met
whether all was weel with their speculation.
“You’re no’ losin’ money, I hope?” asked
Lauder.* They sum up the singing comedian
as a simple-minded, big-hearted little man,
ever really to put himself out of the way
to do' a •kindness that doesn’t get reported
in the press. His alleged penuriousness is
all fable and “gag.” Lauder doesn’t love
the bawbees for the sake of an accumulated
store. He’s the ex-coalminer and thoughtful
Scotsman who learned the value of siller in
his struggling days, and has nothing in com-
mon with the parvenu bounder who splashes
his earnings about.

“X.P.D.”: Two more big pleasure places
will shortly open in Brisbane in the middle
of the city. H. D. Mclntosh’s new theatre,
in Albert-street, opposite the place where
the Town Hall may be in 254 years, ought
to be finished in a couple of weeks, and the
ex-Lord of Battles has made a hurried visit
to see what it looks like. The place is in-
tended to contain the most unexceptionable
legs and highest-paid ragtimers procurable.
For the purposes of the other new show —
consisting of flickergraphs—thousands are
to be spent in pulling the inside out of a
three-storeyed building at the Queen-Albert
street corner, formerly a big drapery.
When it starts there will be four
shows in the main street, with four more
within a couple of hundred yards.
“Adelaide”: Is the Pastor Russell who
has sent Australia the “photo-drama of
Creation” the Pastor Russell whom London
Truth blew out of the water in its issue
of 20/l/’l5? I hope not; for I liked his
free show of Genesis mingled with alleged
modern Science. I liked Isaac’s pained
attitude when Abraham broke it to him that
he was to be the sacrifice —liked the whole
blend of phonograph with “movies.” But it
looks like the same man. Consider these
passages:—
Heralding' the new era with a cinema, entertain-
ment at the Albert Hall....free entertainments, a
photo.-drama of Creation. .. .An ingenious method
of advertising. .. .The whole object being to secure
new adherents. These are not scared at first. There
are no collections at the services. Pastor Russell’s
appeal is more subtle than that.
What is alleged to happen when the ad-
herents are secured I won’t quote, having
some regard for the law of libel; and an
article more recklessly libellous—if untrue
—ha§ seldom been printed.
“Harrison O.”: “Is there anything in
Wilde, from his unmanly cynicism to his
mushy sentiments in poetic piety, which
isn’t decadent?” asks “0.K.” (B. 8/4/T5).
Certainly. What critic, could detect
“decadence” in delightful fooling like “The
Canterville Ghost” and “The Importance
of Being Earnest,” or a magnificent piece
of rhetoric such as “Ave Imperatrix”?
Present writer has read pretty well all of
Wilde’s published works, and the only thing
he would describe as decadent is “The
Picture of Dorian Grey.” “The very title
is decadent,” says “0.K.” of “La Sainte
Courtisane.” Surely this is a new standard
of criticism. It is characteristic of un-
pleasant books that their titles are mostly
innocuous. Thus Strindberg chronicles the
ravings of a sex maniac under the simple,
semi-humorous title, “The Confession of a
Fool”; while Balzac, gloating over a case of
sapphism with a particularly horrible end-
ing, calls his book “The Girl with the
Golden Eyes,” which might be the name of
one of Garvice’s harmless potboilers.
“Private Boxer”: “Avon” has somehow
got hold of the notion that the time is ripe
for a Shakspearian revival. “Tallis, Ward
and Meynell,” says he (B. 8/4/’l5), “have
the performers, costumes and scenery for
a reasonably good presentation of any one
of Shakspeare’s 36 plays.” Granted'; and
what then? “How much the aspiring
actors and actresses would rejoice if Sun-
day evening performances of such were
allowed!” M’yes! And again, I don’t
think! “And how the public would rejoice
and flock !” If the Sabbath evening hap-
pened to be wet. Not otherwise. Where
does “Avon” perceive the signs of this com-
ing Shakspeare boom? Do the full houses
that greet the American farce-comedies and
musical pieces of the “Baldpate” and “High
Jinks” type furnish him with encourage-
ment? Have latter-day productions of the
works of “Avon’s” bard been successful
enough to warrant his optimism? Margaret
Anglin—a much-admired actress —struck
trouble immediately she staged Shakspeare.
Harry Irving was acceptable in most of his
repertory, bar “Hamlet.” Oscar Asehe
would have done better financially, on his
own confession, if be had never put on
“Antony and Cleopatra” and “Midsummer
Night’s Dream.” Lewis Waller’s “Henry
V.” was a frost. So why “Avon” should
think the public would rejoice and flock —
or even rejoice—puzzles me. And even “a
reasonably good presentation” requires a
producer. Where are the producers of the
“legit.” in Australia? I dunno.
“S.S.”: For the first time I have seen
“House Full” hung on the outward wall at
a church. On Good Friday night Melbourne
Anglican Cathedral sported its card* “Cathe-
dral Full,” and the following Monday’s
papers informed me that Board of Health
officials had been compelled to clear the
gangways in the church, and contem-
plated taking action against the cathedral
authorities for over-crowding. However,
more interest really attaches to the suburban
clergyman who occasionally hangs “Church
Empty” on his portal on Sunday evening as
a reproach to the ungodly tribes flocking to
the beach.
“8.J.”: Arthur Frith, who plays the
amorous Colonel Slaughter in “High Jinks,”
has put up a record of sorts by appearing in
“A Chinese Honeymoon” in Shanghai and
Hongkong, “The Geisha” in Japan,
“Havana” in Cuba, “The Cingalee” in Cey-
lon and India, and “The Blue Moon” in
Burma. To round things off, it only re-
mains for him to play Mephistopheles in-
Townsville.
“0.K.”: “Sit down, you’re rocking the
boat,” which Isabelle D’Armond says to
Jack Cannot in one of their Follies duets,
strikes me as being an exceptionally foolish
Yankee catch phrase. It’s so inapt that she
has to explain its meaning before she uses
it. “Rocking the boat” means blithering or
“blowing off hot air.” Seeing that there is
no boat in evidence she might better ex-
claim : “Stop picking your teeth,” or “blow-
ing your nose,” or “clearing your throat.”
“Sit down, you’re rocking the boat,” is seven
times as long and not nearly so expressive
as “Rats!” the meaning whereof didn’t have
to be explained when Fred Kaye introduced
it in “In Town.” Even Marie Lloyd’s
“Everything in the garden’s lovely,” though
more forced and wordy than a catch-phrase
ought to .be, is suggestive, so it survives.
But “rocking the boat” will soon be discarded
by any fatuous retailers of inanities who
may have taken it into stock.
“Upstage”: It was during the performance
of “Mikado” at Her Majesty’s (Melb.). Old
Pat -Beehan, for a long time mummer with
the J.C.W. firm, and now in front of the
house, had been gazing at the tenor; then he
opened his mouth and said : “It’s nearly 30
years since I played in that show. It was
in 1880 at the Theatre Royal here in Mel-
bourne. On the opening night the tenor
(Boyle) could not be found five minutes
hefore the curtain rose. Up jumps the con-
ductor, W. Harrison, and he played the part
(Nanki-Poo) so well that he remained on
the job for 12 weeks. I wonder if there’s a
conductor to-day who could do a thing like
that. By the way, it was that year—lBB6
that Mrs. Armstrong made her first appear-
ance as Melba with Williamson’s Concert
Party.”
Kate Bishop (Mrs. Lohr), mother of
Marie, has a part in H. A, Vachell’s new
play, “Searchlights,” at London Savoy. She
was the original Violet Melrose in “Our
Boys” when it was staged in 1875—and
that’s 40 years ago.
An old pantomimist is as loth to cease
mumming as an old tragedian. There’s the
same craving to be before the public, even
though the artist be merely associated with
the hind leg of an elephant or the front half
of an alligator.. As for the old familiar
Christmas identities who were born into the
business, they can’t give it up. It’s in the
blood. Barry Lupino, who is a member of
the Lauri clan, got word a year ago that
his dad was retiring from the game. The
old man thought he was tired of playing
the goat or the frivolous, wicked baron in
Christmas shows; but his son learned later
that the hardy annual had booked himself
for this season’s panto, at the Glasgow
Royal. And B. Lupino takes after his pro-
genitor. Australia has rarely met a panto-
mimist of a less retiring disposition.

THE ACTOR’S PASSION FOR HIS LANDLADY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He calmly kissed her while we all stood by!
It was a wild, wet night in June. Together
They clung and kissed as if no soul was nigh....
Someone said “Damn!” and someone else asked why
We should be cursed with such dank, streaming
weather.
She couldn’t help her face. But why should he
Stand there and make us witness the embraces?
He did not owe her money, nor was she
In debt to him! But why the deuce were we
Compelled to stand and gibber in our places?
He was an actor (curse the useless breed!)
So for all scenes an audience he needed.
To decency no point would he concede;
Thus he contrived to make us see and heed
Ere with his dedr landlady he receded.
And we —when they had gone—arose and cursed
With vicious the blackguard’s public wooing.
Thenceforth for him a hatred red we nursed ;
While he, in stagey,sentiment immersed,
Poisoned the billing and with cooing.
He fondly gazed on her and she on him,
While steak grew cold and outraged lodgers hotter;
The smoky lamp with shame burned low and dim,
When he (a pretty stageland lover’s whim)
Picked up her hand and kissed it like a rotter!
He quoted poetry at breakfast! She
Grew arch and slapped his fingers, or sat sighing,
While we crouched round in abject misery
And wondered how much more we’d get, ere we
Rushed out and left them for a grand scene trying.
When we were quite insane he simply left—
Kissed her once more and then rang down and
quitted.
And she, his love, finding herself bereft.
With np distressful sounds the lone night cleft,
But got her ’at and to “th’ pitchers” flitted.

"But there'll be something under that, surely ?"
“ Oh, yes, auntie! I’ll be under that."
On April 6 the Sydney evening papers
came out with large-typed contents bills
spread over with three prominent words:
“The Big Fight.” Then Sydney learnt that
the big fight was an unpleasantness in which
a large nigger named Johnson was hit in the
mouth by a larger cowboy named Willard.
Away back in November The Bulletin
referred to an Adelaide case in which the
lawyer for the defendant, having been
knocked out by a unanimous jury of 12,
appealed on the ground that the jury should
have been only six. One of the Judges
remarked that if the lawyer had had a jury
of six live of them could have found a ver-
dict, whereas with a jury of 12 it was
necessary for the whole dozen to go the
one way in order to reach a verdict. The
Bulletin added: “Of course the lawyer
knew that he had had the best of the deal;
but there was just the bare chance of a
technical win, and Costs did the rest.” To
the astonishment. of The Ville-
neuve Smith, who was the lawyer in the
case, is offended by this, and says it is cal-
culated to injure his professional reputation.
The Bulletin is sorry. It had no inten-
tion just then of hurting anybody's feelings.
It thought at the time that the lawyer, who-
ever he was, was a good fighter, who
grabbed every chance that showed even the
tip of its tail, and held on to it on his
client’s behalf. It didn’t for a moment sup-
pose that Mr. Smith either did or cohld do
all this for honor and glory; the remarks
that “Costs did the rest” simply meant that,
so long as the client would provide the
tucker, knowing that there was merely a
bare chance of winning, the lawyer would
provide the ammunition and the fight; also
that, if the client couldn’t or wouldn’t pro-
vide the tucker, he naturally would miss his
last bare chance of winning. In that, nothing
in the least immoral or unprofessional was
intentionally implied; and The Bulletin
does not feel the least compunction in giv-
ing Mr. Smith this assurance, and in adding
its regret that its remark has been read
otherwise.

Perhaps the least likely man on earth to
require that last infirmity of nobbled minds,
an illuminated address, is Albert of Belgium.
Yet that is what he will have to hump from
trench to trench in Flanders, if a misguided
committee in Melbourne has its way. The
communique issued by these ardent souls is
as follows:
It is felt by a number of gentlemen that occasion
should be taken of the Birthday of King Albert to
place on permanent record our feelings of gratitude,
admiration and sympathy for him and the whole of
the Belgian Nation by means of an Address, signed as
universally as possible, the sum of £1 and no more
accompanying each signature. It is suggested that
the address should be illuminated and bound up with
all the signatures into a beautiful Volume or
volumes, the cost of which has been provided. Not
only would such a gift be very pleasing to the King,
but the money raised thereby would form a sub-
stantial addition to the Belgian Funds.
The movement, it is only natural to learn,
has. the cordial sympathy of Hennessy, the
Gaud Mayor. It seems to be an effort on
the part of nonentities to buy themselves into
vicarious fame at a pound a head. Fortu-
nately Albert is the kind of soldier who
hath a wallet at his back into which lie
putteth alms for oblivion, so he won’t suffer
the address to be in the way, and there’s no
reason why the Belgians shouldn’t get the
quids.

“Vagabond”: If “The Old Soldier” will
permit me I’d like to dispel some of his
notions as to the “holocaust of British offi-
cers” (B. 19/11/T4). The holocaust is all
right, but his explanation is off the target.
It is not the detailing of sharpshooters to
pick off officers, and the “well-cut breeches”
and tunic with “waist”, have for many sod-
den months been effectually disguised
in greatcoats and macintoshes and layers
of mud. If the safest dress for an
officer to masquerade in would be that
of an old tramp, plenty of good offi-
cers ought to be invulnerable. The
plain truth is that the officer has to take
more risks than the men. If the skies are
raining bullets, and any second • may see a
rush from the German trenches close at
hand, someone must take frequent observa-
tions. An officer might crouch in safety
and order a man to expose himself; but if
he did (and we’ll admit perhaps he ought
to, seeing his loss is more serious to his
company) he could not be sure that the
private was doing the job properly. Anyhow,
right or wrong, being the chap he is, he usu-
ally does it himself, and too often down one
more officer goes. Again, when the word
to charge is given, the officers must show
the may— must be first to scramble out of
the safety of the trench’s cover; must stand
there a minute to see his men get out; must
get them in some sort of shape; must lead
the charge. If it fails and the fragments uf the
attack dribble back to the trench, the officer
must be the last in; probably he runs up
and down, rallying the men, and urging
them on to another try. In an artillery
action the section officers, in charge of two
guns, often have to leave the comparative
safety of cover to duck from one gun to
the other when anything goes wrong; or they
may have to run the gauntlet to the battery-
commander’s shelter-pit to make a report or
get an order; and they must be the first out
of cover and the last into it when the guns
commence or cease action. The gunner
subaltern, too, has to go forward to a posi-
tion, usually amongst the advanced infantry

trenches, where he can get a good view of
the enemy trenches, observe his battery’s
shells falling, and correct and direct the aim
by _ ’phone to the guns away in the rear.
Being in a good position to see must mean
a highly unhealthy exposure to rifle and
shell fire —and more officers go down. It
is not any wonder these casualties are heavy;
the wonder to me is rather that any officers
survive a decently-warm engagement.
German “thoroughness” has fallen in over
some of its instructions to Hans and Fritz

which were to be kept by the uncapturable
Huns for the future information of their
military bosses, frank admissions have been
found on many of the prisoners in the Allies’
hands. One interesting exhibit is a phrase
book issued for the use of officers when the
Huns invade Britain. This reveals that the
officer was expected to eat and swill like a
hog and bully like a bantam cock. A sec-
tion is set apart for the use of Hans and
Fritz when they billet themselves on trem-
bling British householders. One of these
days, perhaps, a Hun naval officer will be
found with a “Guide to Conversation in
Sydney” concealed about his corpse, full' of
this sort of stuff in German and English:
“Your harbor is beautiful but your beer is
beastly. We Germans will improve both.”
“Fetch the Lord Mayor. If he does not
bring a large -contribution he will be shot.”
“If our flag-is not hoisted on all the ferry-
boats by six o’clock the village of Manly will
be razed.’’ “‘Any civilian who looks dis=-
pleased will be placed under arrest,” etc.,
etc.
“Mary McC.” : Isn’t it time a plain police-
man stepped in and stopped this silly game
of playing with snakes? Snake exhibitions
arc not wholesome, anyhow, and there is a
lot of danger with which the crank can’t
cope. Sooner or later the “charmers'’
always get bitten, which is only fair; but
occasionally it is some fool onlooker who is
fanged. The other day Thomas Trengrove
was nipped while “showing” in Melbourne.
He was taken to the hospital, where he ex-
plained that his private antidote was mis-
laid or was away on a trade picnic, or some-
thing. It is always like that. The antidote
is to the fore in the talk with the newspaper
man, but it is the doctor who saves the life
when the poison is really injected. Tren-
grove has dozens of black, brown and tiger
snakes, and he ought to have six months as
well.

THE LITTLE HILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Little Hill was blossom-clad just half a year
ago,
For someone’s orchard burgeoned there and roofed
the slope with snow;
The earth was carpeted with grass—there was no
fence to stay
The rhymer or the wand’ring cow that chanced
along that way.
I used to watch the mountains there and take my
fill of peace,
While wond’ring who had served the trees and how
long was his lease.
Raw, red-roofed villas like still crabs clung to the
hills close by;
But there the fruit trees waved white hands in wel-
come to the sky.
Oft have I sat and heard the wind converse with
trees and grass.
(And one forgets to note the time when dreams and
shadows pass.)
The afternoons I “wasted” there in silence and
content
Were golden hours unsoiled by thoughts of unpaid
bills and rent.
And now they’ve come and slashed the Hill! Aye,
cut it deep and straight
With dusty paths and carriage-ways! We won’t have
long to wait
Before the little villas sprout where Life and Death
both call;
And then for doctors’ motors, kids, and funerals
and all I
Confound the narrow little life, so full of narrow
plots,
Conventions, hedges, jealousies and wilting plants in
pots!
God burn the washing on the line—the paling fences
high!
They desecrate the Hill that waved its white hands
at the sky.
Where all was freedom, color, joy, is cut and
cramped and grey;
No birds are singing on the Hill—the murdered Hill
—to-day!
Here old men, each within his fence, will potter
short of breath.
And, pottering, await in fear their liberator, Death.
The Little Hill was blossom-clad but half a year
ago,
And now it hasn’t got a tree! The place you’d never
know!
The Lord of Heaven’s singing birds to further hills
have fled.
The Lord has also gone, but here’s the Landlord
in His stead

HOW I RUBBED AWAY A STONE OF
FAT FROM MY HIPS AND ABDOMEN
IN TWO WEEKS TIME.
For years I tried every possible means to
hide the excessive fat on my hips and abdo-
men, it seemed as if it had accumulated on
just the two places that it would be most
noticeable. Everything that I tried failed
to make me any thinner. But thanks to a
lady friend who had studied herboristerie, I
learned the secret of a harmless plan which
enabled me to rub away with ease a stone of
useless fat in only two weeks.
The plan is so simple and some of my
friends seem so glad to know of it that I
think there may be sister readers of The
Bulletin who have perhaps been longing
for this very advice. First, get from any
good chemist 1 dram of quassia chips and
ooz. of cirola bark extract. Take them
home, and after putting the quassia chips in
a pan pour over it a teacupful of boiling
water. When this has stood for about a
minute, strain through a cloth and add the
cirola bark extract. Then pour the mixture
into a bottle and apply it every night and
morning with your hands for about 10
minutes, using a circular movement. Each
time you can almost see some of the fat melt
away. At first I thought it must be a dream,
but when I measured there was no longer
any doubt. I soon grew too slender for my
clothes and had to have them taken in, but
it was a pleasure to do it. and I shall feel
eternally grateful to the lady who showed

“Vagabond” from a hospital in England :
The day may come, as “Foe” suggests (B.
19/11/’l4), when the horse will be chased off the
battlefield; but at present he takes place as second-
best and surest means of transport in war, man being
best, and the motor third. Motors bring shell and
rifle ammunition to a point some miles in rear of the
fighters. The loads are then transferred to horsed
vehicles, and by them taken up into the bullet-
whizzing zone. From there they are carried to the
gun or the rifle per man. Exactly the same order
applies to food and (reversed) to ambulance. “Foe”
is correct in his account of War Office haulage tests
of field guns per motor. But this test was on Eng-
lish roads and in peace time. The great drawback to
the motor in the firing line or zone is that, despite
its metallic hide and higher speed, a shell has a.
tougher hide and a higher speed; and although a
dead moke is a “mere cumbersome mass of meat”
when he is dead, he isn’t a fraction as cumbersome
as a mass of dead motor. If “Foe” sat wet and
shivering on a wet horse on a wet road one wet
night for several wet hours,* because the road was
blocked by a mountainous motor that had side-
slipped into the ditch, or developed indigestion of
petrol, he’d realise just how cussedly cumbersome
a dead motor-lorry is. If a horse in a gun-team
stops a bullet he doesn’t hold the procession up long.
If a shell removes half a horse very few seconds
suffice to cut clear the other half, and the team and
gun go on. But if a shell disturbs a motor’s inside
the whole procession remains there till another com-
plete motor arrives. Also, horses can get a gun or
waggon through a mud field that would give a motor
palpitation of the sparking plug to even look at.
In war the motor , can’t be beaten so long as it has
more or less of a road to work on. But no self-
respecting motor could wade through the duck-pond
and mud-heap ground the guns often have to cross.
And when an agitated General sends an urgent
message to “bring up the guns,” the guns really
can’t wait for a road to be made. I fancy, there-
fore, that so long as Generals are inconsiderate
enough to fight battles where roads don’t exist, and
where mud, ditches, mud, embankments and more
mud do, the four-ldjgged, long-nosed chum will con-
tinue to bear the heat and burden of the day and
the cold and cursing of the night.
A THREATENED INDUSTRY.

“Rimu”: The housewife who buys six-
pence worth of potatoes gets them in a
paper bag; the baker brings his bread in
an open basket, and not only paws it over
with his own more or less unclean hands,
but lets everybody else paw it. Why is
the baker allowed to be a filthy hog when
the law compels other tradesmen to make at
least a pretence of cleanliness? If N.S.W.
State Minister Hall will deliver bread
cleanly from the public bakery it will be a
real reform. Every master baker in N. S.
Wales _ has gone on passing his foodstuff
round in the old dirty manner, and on that
ground alone there isn’t one of them who
deserves any consideration.

FEEDING THE

sequence of the shortage
of food in Germany
nearly 1,000,000 German
soldiers are billeted in

been compelled to board
20, and the occupants of

GERMAN PIGS IN
BELGIUM.
The Daily Mail war
correspondent states
that, owing to the short-
age of fodder in Ger-
many, nearly a million
German pigs are billeted
in Belgium. Some of the
wealthiest citizens are
compelled to board 20
pigs, while fewer pigs
have to be kept by the
poorer Belgians in their
houses and flats.
The Journal, being Conservative and naice,
thought the cable contained slang, and so
paraphrased it -according to its lights.
Plainly, to avoid confusion, we shall have to
get anew word, for the beast that runs on
four legs and gr&nts.

“Dogberry”: Kaiser Bill himself might
learn lessons in self-importance in Mel-
bourne’s suburban police courts. Recently
a P.M. was dealing with a batch of drill
shirkers, to one of whom he said, with slow
and solemn pomp: “Have you anything to
say in excuse for your conduct?” “No-
thing.,” mumbled the boy in the box. “No-
thing?” echoed Rhadamanthus. “Nothing?
A man who comes before Me, on such an
Occasion as this, on a charge of This charac-
ter, and announces that All he can say is
‘Nothing’ is not a Person of whom I can
entertain a very high Opinion. Now, if Ger-
many should emerge victorious from this
titanic Struggle, you and I, who hold com-
fortable and responsible Positions, may be
compelled to take employment of a Menial
character. But consider our glorious Bri-
tish” Here a long-suppressed guffaw
burst from a listener in court. “Stand up!
Attention!” exclaimed the scandalised beak.
The interrupter stood sheepishly forward.
“What have you to say as to Why you
should not be dealt with for your unseemly
conduct?” asked the stern P.M. With ears
cocked and mouths agape the court habitues
waited the reply. “Nothing!” said the
sheep ; and the whole dreadful performance
was started over again.

The King of Spain who died of thirst
because the Court Cup Bearer was not
present to ask with due pomp whether he
had a mouth on him has his modern paral-
lels. One of them was Arthur Nightingale,
whose death, though due to too much rather
than too little water, was none the less the
result of a wicked convention. The lad
had swum to a raft moored in the sea at
Elwood (Vic.), off which he slipped into 6ft.
of water. In difficulty, he cried for help,
and a man who could not swim called for
assistance to a passing cyclist, who could.
The cyclist stripped swiftly, but, noticing
some women close by. delayed operations
to don bathing togs in the sacred name of
Grundy. Then he dived twice for Nightin-
gale, but the boy was unconscious when
brought to the surface, and died after two
hours’ vain work by the local life-saving
club. Grill the Grundies !

“And did you really succeed in reforming

“Mallee Hen” on woman’s clumsiness :—•
“Hornet’s” watchmaker friend, talking of women’s
clumsiness, says the only clumsier animal is a cow.
He doesn’t except elephants. . He doesn’t even except
men. We have a creature of the last species here.
He came home just now and upset the chair that
holds the front door open. We have had four hot
nights this week, so the chair has been upended four
times, the baby has been waked four times, and four
times we have eaten our tea in whatever iss the
opposite to peace and quiet.
Last week this same queer creature rose hurriedly
to pass the cake. He forgot about his legs, and
one of them had an altercation with an afternoon-
tea table. It cost us 10s., and will cost more as
soon as we can afford anew carpet.
The baby sleeps in his pram on the back veran-
dah. Yesterday the man attempted to pass the pram
with an armful of wood. The verandah is 10ft. w' ’e
and two steps up from the ground. The man can’t
explain how it happened, but in lOsec. the pram
was on its side, the baby was yelling (two yards
further on), and the dog was exceeding the speed
limit through the back gate. We are not sure
whether the pram or the baby hit the dog.
Are men clumsy?
Anyway, does it matter if a woman is clumsy ?
Sometimes—in fact, most times—she has to bathe
and dress six and a half pounds of screaming, writh-
ing humanity about as tangible as a wine-jelly or
an eel; or perhaps get up at 3 a.m., and, with her
senses half-awake, measure to a drop something for
baby’s bottle. Or else, with a baby on her arm and
one at her skirts, she goes about the making of a
souffle for dinner. The cookery-book threatens total
i uin of the dish unless infinite care is taken, and
commands that the flour be “wafted” into the mix-
ture about as heavily as a “summer cloud settles on
a hill.”
I would love to show you a father of two days
conveying his offspring from the cradle to the bed ;
and, oh, I would most dearly love to make “Hornet’'’
eat a souffle prepared by the average man!
“Sarah”: The young Austra-
lian can be sudden when he (or
she) takes the fit. I met an old
friend lately, and she told her
story. When she returned from
a week-end visit to Sorrento to
her Melbourne suburban home,
she found a “To Let” board up
and a brief intimation on the
door that the family had re-
moved to Superior-street,
Selecton. The family
comprises the parents,
three adult daughters
and two sons, and they
had been dwelling in a
business street in a com-
modious house, whose
shop front the frugal
father had sublet. This
didn’t worry the old
people or the boys, but it
got on the nerves of the
three girls ; so in mother’s
absence and while dad
and the boys were at
work they transferred
the whole outfit. Also
simultaneously they con-
signed some of the fur-
niture to an auction
room, bought more mod-
ern fixings, and charged
it up to dad. The boys
laughed, dad said some-
thing indistinct, and
mum took it quietly.
Possibly the fact that
mum spends most of her
time knitting socks for
soldiers, while the boys
can’t get a button put on,
has something to do with
her calm. You can do a
lot to a woman of that
sort before she “goes
sour.” But, as she says,
the “To Let” board did give her a shock.

■ “Quill”: The Government Gazette,
issued at Rabaul on February 15, consists
mainly of a description of the place where
the Germans didn’t make such a bad bargain.
Yet it has its gleams. Referring to the
native compound, where contract laborers,
police boys and Marys live a more or less
mixed life, there is this: “The crimes com-
mitted are of no great variety, gentlemen
criminals of the higher order being unknown.”
Which means, presumably, that among the
gang of niggers getting Is. per day, no com-
pany promoters have been discovered, nor
any gorgeous scions of noble houses buying
diamonds for nymphs of the local planta-
tions with valueless cheques. This amazing
circumstance has very properly been put on
record, otherwise the historian of the future
might be misled into the grave error of
thinking that the “two cases of cannibalism
awaiting trial” represented deeds committed
by dukes or, at the least, baronets.

“The Shearers’ Cook” : For resource in a
tight corner, I’ll back a fox against any animal pro-
duced. Was riding along with three mates when we
came across a silver-grey lamb-stealer lying dead
just off the track. When we’d topped , the rise about
50 yards ahead, we met the boss and a boundary-
rider beating the bushes for a fox they’d wounded.
We rode back with tliem to where we’d seen the
carcase, but it had removed itself. On examining
the tracks it was plain that foxy’s .progress was, per
three legs. Knowing that it wouldn’t have stood
Buckley’s chance of otherwise getting away from
us thus crippled, it had simply pulled our legs.

“8.W.” : Maewo, in the New Hebrides, is
famous for its superior breed of Pigs (Pig in the
Islands should always be written with a capital. He
is more important than money), and certain Sup-
posed breeders are the possessors of special charms,
chiefly stones, which are . supposed to get busy and
make the animals multiply extra quick. These
stenes are decked with leaves and prayed to for the
desired result. Should one of the animals happen
to wander away from the village, his owner will
•go to the grave of some ancestor, and, making an
offering of croton leaves, request deceased to “get
back my pig for me.” Should the defunct be in a
good temper he rounds up the wandering one and
returns it to the village; if not, there is only one
thing for the owner to do —to go and look for the
hog himself.
THE POINT OF VIEW.
THE FEMALE SPEEDER: “I suppose you were awfully vexed when you found your wife
had run off with your chauffeur?”
THE MALE SPEEDR: “Oh, no. He wasn't much of a chauffeur.”
“Flinderino”: The rain-coat made of
thatch worn by Chinese boatmen during the wet
season up North is a more sensible covering than
the oilskin worn by the white men. The mariner
in the airtight oilskin is usually in a bath of per-
spiration, whereas the straw cloak is light, dry in-
side, and comfortable, besides being- inexpensive. At
the Cairns wharf I have seen dozens of fruit-growing-
Chinkies who, although they had been out all night
in the rain, yet on shedding their thatch were per-
fectly dry.
“Lagani-Namo”: A few lilies about my
ol 1 friend, Tatakou, the great sorcerer of Maiva,
Papua. Until he was removed as an unwilling guest
to the gaol at Kla, there wasn’t a native within a
20-mile radius of him who didn’t live in a per-
petual dread of incurring his displeasure. Wherefore
his pigs, paradise-bird plumes, and pearlshell mailies
(crescent-shaped breast ornaments) increased and
multiplied. So subtly did he work his mischief that,
despite the everlasting endeavors of the Government,
aided by the missionaries in that district, to bring
Tatakou to book for some of the premature funerals
he caused, he flourished, and his evil reputation
extended y’ear after year. A native strolling along
a lonely path in the scrub would suddenly see
Tatakou standing in his way, regarding him intently,
but maybe not deigning to speak to him. Presently
that nigger would begin to sicken, shrink to a mere
skeleton, and finally—with frothing mouth and
paroxysms of pain—pass Qiy(. I happened on to such
a case on several occ^jons; and battled for a week
once with one of my own native agents whom this
fiend had poisoned. At tire end of that time my
emetics, arguments and ’tfjj-eats triumphed. During
the first three days the patient was fully convinced
that nothing could save him. All he’d say was:
“Soon I die. White men do not understand these
things. Tatakou knows much; his eyes are so
str ng that their look can kill. I understand. To-
morrow I die.” At the time I arrived at his village
his relatives had carried the sick man across a river
into -the middle of a swamp, and there they sat
whining around him. It appears that one of
Tatakou’s family was taken by a crocodile at that
place some time previously; and the niggers de-
duced from this that the sorcerer’s influence was
powerless there. Tatakou was conceited about his
guilefulness, and delighted in pitting himself in
argument or cross-examination against the various
European missioners in his locality. One day, as
he squatted tailor-fashion on a sky-pilot’s verandah
puffing at his bau-bau, a German priest noticed that
the bark cloth covering Tatakou’s hair moved, as
though something living was beneath it. Quick
as the thought, lie gave the headgear a jab with his
own baii-bau (he happened to be smoking a bamboo
pipe, native fashion) and knocked it off, whereupon a
venomous brown snake foil out. How Tatakou man-
aged to put the serpent in his hair, or to take it
out, without being bitten, I cannot tell you. Any-
how, this was used as a pretext for a charge of
sorcery, but the wily pourri-pourri man contended
that the snake was simply a pet, and that lie had
just as much right to wear him in his hair as other
natives had to carry about lice. In fact, he hinted
that the snake destroyed these vermin, and that
this was why he harbored it. He got clear.
“The- R”: The magistrate at the Tro-
briand Islands! in Papuan waters, was approached
by a very-. 1 T’rate husband, who complained bitterly
about one Of his women producing- twins. “Ugh!”
grunted he, “all the people will say that this woman
is a pig- and will by-’n’-bye bring- forth a litter.”
The magistrate tried to solace the discomfited father
by presenting him with five sticks of. tobacco by way
of-bonus for each child, and our cannibal brother
withdrew his complaint for the time being. Five
days later, though, when he had finished the tobacco,
he returned with all sorts of arguments to back up
a demand that twins be made an indictable offence.
“Chug”: According to the report of Mr.
Maiden, the Curator, a black snake was found last
year in the Sydney Botanic Gardens. A writer of
Nature Notes suggests that other serpents likely to
be seen there are the red-naped, red-bellied, black-
backed and blind varieties. 1 have frequently noticed
the ground alive with the blue-horned, orange-
whiskered and green-toothed varieties. They frequent
the roots of Moreton Bay fig-trees mostly. I wish
Mr. Maiden would get rid of them. They disturb a
gentleman’s rest.

groom outback is a small hut or tent by the road-
side, his only companions a dog and the coach-
horses. These run in the open bush, and his work
is to look after them and have- them ready in the
sapling yard when the coach arrives. At half the
places it arrives during night-time. He helps with
the changing, afterwards rubbing down the sweat-
covered animals that have been cast off. The coach
passes once or twice a week, staying only just long-
enough to swap horses, a matter of a few minutes.
Between times a traveller may call while passing
along the road, and is generally welcome to a night’s
rest there. It is the groom's only chance of a yarn.
'The coach-driver gives him the news from up and
down the road, and he is a greedy man for it, too.
One, whom the driver called Peter, came 50yds. down
the road to meet the coach in which I was part of
the cargo. He was short and stout, almost as broad
as he was long, his fat face three-parts covered witli
thick, black stubble. He was short-winded, in his
eyes the light of eagerness and excitement. We
thought there had been some extraordinary happen-
ing at the camp. We leaned out to listen. “What
won?” asked Peter, breathlessly. The driver named
three horses that had run fh«t, second and third in
a Mulga Handicap back at the border. “Where did
Streaker come?” “Fair last.” Peter took off his
hat and slapped it against his leg. “I knew it,” he
cried ecstatically. “Didn’t I tell him so? Why, th’
dash cow couldn’t gallop as fast as I could kick my
hat.” From the Mulga Handicap Peter drifted to
people and places along the road. He knew every-
body for a hundred miles either way ; but it seemed
that, like most of the tribe, he connected them all
with something or other on four legs. As the wheels
began to revolve again he fired after us: “Did Andy
Payne find his bullock?”

“Tiaki”: In spite of Kerristian teaching
Ilenare hangs pretty close to his ancient tohunga
beliefs; I happened to be in a whare some months
ago when an old lady demonstrated her ability as a
“medium.” Divine service of the Anglican brand
was in progress, when the sorceress broke into the
dark interior of the whare-puni. She commenced by
gazing with eyes like boiled gooseberries into space.
Her finger traced an imaginary trajectory describ-
ing the flight of a soul. Suddenly' we heard a high,
thin voice call from the roof: “Mihi mai Jci au, e
hoa riia, mild mai ki au” (Greet me, 0 friends, greet
me). The Word was discarded by all hands in - a
hurry, and weeping wahines and men proffered their
greetings to the “souls” of their gone-befores. After
the spasm had passed the old lady was mad because
.she had become mediumistic in the presence of
a pakeba. Afterwards I told her quietly that pro-
fessional ventriloquists avoid labial sounds as much
as possible, but got nothing for the information but
an assortment of tamns and other blankies.
“AlcNorth”: Lots of people who consume
sago., and who imagine it to be a grain grown in
the ear like rice or wheat, wouldn’t be so fond of
it if they witnessed the primary! process of its manu-
facture as practised in Papua, In the-Western and
Gulf divisions, where there, are thousands of acres
of sago swamps, the niggers first cut down the palm,
which very much resembles a cocoanut ■ tree, and
split it into two sections. A section at a time is
placed at such an angle that" water will run freely
over it lengthwise. Though the outside skin is hard
the inside consists of pith, and that is what contains
the sago. Brown Brother and Brown Sister —-mostly
Sister —then beat the pith with a flail-like arrange-
ment, while an attendant pours water on. The beat-
ing breaks up the pith and the water dissolves it
and carries away the refuse. The stuff remaining is
NOT APPRECIATED.
HE: “ There's old Jobkins. Quite a self-made
Man.”
SHE: “I low proud his wife and daughters
must be of him!”
HE: “ Yes—just about as proud as they would
be of a home-made hat”
then worked up by black feet and black hands into
a sodden cheese-like substance. This is the sago.
While the beating- and washing are in progress, betel-
nut is freely chewed. But as betel-nut makes a pink
saliva, and many varieties of sago in their crude
form are of the same hue, you don’t notice it. Of
course, the sago of commerce is more or less purified
during granulation and dressing, but most people
who have seen the process are not keen on it.
SMITH'S GIFT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Thomas Smith, the drummer, drove
To Johnson's by the “crick,”
A stroke of sun had got the cove,
And he was very sick. 1 ***
He lay three weeks on Johnson’s bed,
And never raised his tortured head.
The drought was hard upon the land,
The hills were baked and dry ;
The “crick” was dry, the “paddicks,” and
The sullen, barren sky.
And Johnson, though extremely broke,
Just mothered the commercial bloke.
They carried water miles for Smith,
And when he was all right
The place was still afflicted with
The Drought Fiend's sandy blight.
The mouldering sheep bestrewed the flat,
And only crows were glad and fat.
Then Smith declared some gift he'd give
(They would not take his pay) ;
He’d not forget them should he live
For ever and a day.
He’s sent them —what do you suppose?
One hundred feet of (jarden hose!

THE BEST THING FOR DYSPEPTICS.
WHY PEPSIN, PANCIiEATIN, ETC.,
SO FREQUENTLY FAIL.
An international specialist, whose articles
on stomach trouble have been printed in
nearly every language, recently stated that
to treat the average case of stomach trouble,
indigestion, dyspepsia, etc., by doctoring the
stomach, killing the pain with opiates, or by
the use of artificial aids to digestion, such
as pepsin and pancreatin, was just as foolish
and useless as to attempt to put out a fire
by throwing water on the smoke, instead of
tiie fire. He claims, and facts seem to jus-
tify his claim, that nearly nine-tenths of all
stomach trouble is due to acidity and food
fermentation; and that the only way in
which to secure permanent relief is to get
rid of the cause — i.e., to neutralise the acid
and stop the fermentation. For this pur-
pose he strongly recommends the plan now
generally adopted by physicians and in hos-
pitals of taking a half-teaspoonful of ordi-
nary bisuratcd magnesia in a little water
immediately after eating or whenever pain
is felt. This immediately neutralises the
acid, stops the fermentation, and permits the
stomach to do its work in a normal manner,
and thus, by removing the cause, enables
nature to quickly restore the inflamed
stomach lining to a perfectly healthy, natu-
ral condition. For the convenience of
travellers it may be noted that most
chemists are now able to supply bisurated
magnesia in the form of tablets, two or three
of which will almost instantly relieve the
most violent attacks of indigestion.*

“Billy T.” : I met her first at Harding’s,
some miles out from Morwell. She came up from
the track, humping a formidable bluey with the
grace of a veteran of the ’so’s, and camped within
sight of the house, making a fire, swinging her billy,
and spreading her blanket on the lee of a fallen
gum-butt. She was a tallish old woman in a poke
bonnet of ancient make, and a one-piece “tailor-
made” of blue dungaree. One of the Harding girls
interviewed her. “You mustn’t sleep out here,” she
said. “Come up to the house, and you can have
supper and a shake-down.” The nomad was very
grateful. She said she was the M’idow Lee ; she was
travelling to Brindle Creek, she said, to visit a
daughter-in-law who was “expecting.” 1 came upon
her again a month later at Brindle Creek. She had
camped in Ryan's cow paddock, and Mrs. Ryan had
taken her in, and they were exchanging views con-
cerning measles and domestic economy. On the fol-
lowing day, as 1 was driving through to Pie Flat, I
detected a male pedestrian a mile ahead on a rise.
The ped. was humpin’ his drum. He disappeared
after a few minutes, and when he came in view
again he (or she) was wearing a one-piece female
costume of blue dungaree and an old poke bonnet,
and presently assailed me with: “You might give a
poor body a lift, mister. I’m trudgin’ to Pie Flat,
where me son’s wife is expectin’.” I carried the
swagwoman to Pie Flat, and when she dismounted
there I said: “Straight! now, which is it? You were
sporting pants when I saw you first this afternoon.”
The party in the poke grinned broadly. “It’s Bill
Lee,” he said. “Look what a traveller’s g-otter come
down to to raise a square feed and a doss these days.
Half the time they’ll put the dogs on you if you're
a man. But,” he added, reflectively, “it is a knock
in the ear when they give you half a dollar for a
day’s washin’.” I saw Bill Lee next morning. He
still wore the blue gown, and was down on his
knuckle-bones, scrubbing the front verandah of
Gunner’s pub. “Don’t give it away, mate,” he said.
“Mrs. Gunner’s gone to Melbourne with a tumor..
I’m house-keepin’ fer Gunner!”
* * * *
“Ida” : The charge is (say) stealing Gov-
ernment stores, laid by a loyal village constable
against one. of his Papuan natives. The proceedings
generally go this way:—
Native Constable (vehemently): “Fashion belongs
you no good! AVhaffor you stealem somethings’ be-
longa plurry Government ?”
Defendant (aggressively) : “Heh! You seeim me
alonga heye, heh? You gottim heye, heh? Go on you ;
alia time you lie alonga plurry Government.”
Constable (indignantly) : “No good you lie alia
same. Me no savee lie alonga plurry Government.
That one fashion belonga you. Before you been
stealem two fellar armshell alonga”
Defendant (satirically): “Yes? Ha, ha! You alia
same cockatoo, too much talk alia. time. Me savee
fashion alonga you too much lie alonga plurry Gov-
ernment alia time. What about that old fellar
woman you been hit alonga heye before alonga finger

Constable (collapsing) : “You a—a —you—plurry
nigger.”
Court orderly (authoritatively): “Heh! M'hat
fashion this? You fellar no savee this place he no
village belonga you. This one plurry court, belonga
Government. No good you makem this bad talk
here. Bye-a-bye I”

THE VALLE OF MATHEMATICS.
“’Struth, Bill! Drinks thrippence! Will

"No, Dave —twice as drunk ƒ'r the same

“Blunt Knife” : When the Gasiri natives
in Papua, capture a wallaby they rub their eyelids
with a piece of the heart. This, they (believe,
enables them to see game better when hunting.
UNCLE'S LITTLE TREASURES.
Relatives of Germans killed in Belgium are allowed to enter the country to search for their dead,
and to take coffins. It has been discovered that many of the coffins are returned full of plunder. One fell
off a truck, disclosing silver teapots and trays. -Cable.
MRS. HOGGENSTEINER (over the fence): “ More peautiful corpses, Mrs. Isaackewier?”
MRS. ISAUHEIMER : " Ach, tier Teetle treasures! Dear uncle vos so fond of dem !”
“E.S.S.” : “Looking for thunderstorms” is
a common job out West. Stockmen ride out day
after day, when weather conditions have been favor-
able, looking for the tracks of storms, and following
them across the runs. When any holes or tanks in
a storm’s course have received a few days’ Supply,
sheep are at once shifted on to them, to be removed
later on to the remains of another storm, perhaps
many miles away. The tracks are often not more
than half a mile wide, and it is one of the most
tantalising experiences; of squatting to see storm
after storm cross the parched runs and miss every
hole and tank upon them, while filling a long chain
of claypans between. These claj'pans then look like
miniature lakes —till they again in a few days show
hard and white under a blistering sun. An alluring
mirage hovers over each one like a body of water
until the horseman draws near; then it lifts, to
appear again at the next. Cattle viewed through
the everlasting haze of the plains look like giraffes
—elongated monstrosities that seem to hover on a
shadowy surface, several feet above the earth. Sheep
assume the proportions of cattle, and the whole
atmosphere appears to be filled with films of dancing,
shimmering silk. Distances are hard to gauge;
horsemen disappear at no great distance on open
plains. You see something coming towards you, but
until quite close you cannot tell whether it is a
footman or a camel, an emu or a bullock team; for
all objects seem to float, sometimes to within speak-
ing distance, till the haze flits beyond them, when
they resume their normal shape and dimensions.
“Stockman” (from back o’ Thargo-
mindah) : I see by one of the papers that the Mar
Office has purchased 450,0001 b. of Tasmanian apricot
and black-currant jam. Could you, as a favor, ask
them to buy 4,500,0001 b. of plum jam? If you will,
every bushman’ 11 shout for you when he goes down
to Sydney. Hitherto we’ve got 46 tins of plum
jam in the case of 4doz. when we’ve sent for
“assorted,” and to have another tin of plum crowded
in will break us up.
* * * *
“L.-N.”: If the malaria mosquito is on
the job in Australia this information should come
in handy. Quinine tablets (in common with many
drugs sent to the tropics in pill form) quickly deterio-
rate and prove very ineffective. The flocculent sul-
phate taken in gelatine capsules is much better ; but
by far the best is quinine-iron in solution. I haven’t
had any fever or ague since I consumed a few bottles
of a tonic prescribed by the late Dr. Koch five years
ago. So many others were of the same opinion about
this medicine that when the doc. died subscriptions
came from all parts of the Torrid North and the
Islands to build the fountain which stands to his
honor in Cairns.
“Outcast”: Leap Year isn’t required in
the west end of Papua and through the Torres
Straits. As a matter of fact, these regions are
highly commendable places for young gentlemen
who do not want to remain bachelors. The over-
tures towards marriage always come —at least they
did in the grand old days—from the lady, and
when she spotted the buck upon whom she had cast
Her young affections her overtures were prompt and
assiduous. The conclusion to the affair was a sort
of sham fight between the relatives of the high
contracting parties, after which the coy nyJden
went off to the Queen Anne villa of her young man.
Either in Santa Cruz or the Hebrides or the Banks
Group (I forget which island it really is) the lady
always pops the question, and if she is turned down
Mrs. Grundy demands that she commit suicide or
something equally unpleasant.
* * * *
“By-Gum”: Nothing surprising about the
specimen of gold found at Maryborough (Vic.) and
relinquished for £lO. When gold was plentiful in
the old days, and it didn’t pay to crush unless the
metal went ounces to the ton, the foundations of
the principal street of Maryborough (High-street)
were formed of gold-infected quartz that would pay
handsomely to crush now. The streets of gold are
not all in Paradise. In the N.W. part of the town
is a park called the Market Square. A local puddler
offered to put a six-inch layer of soil right over
its large area provided he could remove the surface
earth —a payable proposition for him, no doubt, as
particles of gold are always found in the Square
after a heav} 7 rain. The Council turned the offer
down, desiring to hang on to its reserve fund for a
more impecunious day.
“Wandi”: We were coaching towards
Broken Hill, and near Packsaddle we met the up-
coaeh. On the box-seat sat a thin, bedraggled,
ferocious-looking female. She gave the order to
pull up, at the same time signalling with a folded
gingham to our driver to do the same. “Have you
seen him?” she asked the latter. “No, missus.”
“Heard anything of him?” “Not a word.” “Did
you hinquire?” “Yes.” “Did you keep a look-out?”
“1 did.” “Have you any men inside?” “Three.”
“I’ll have a look at them. ’Tisn’t as I doubt yer
word, but I don’t feel so satisfied if I let a man go
by me without inspectin’ him.” She climbed down,
and, shuffling across to our conveyance, thrust her
head in and subjected each of us in turn to scrutiny.
Then she said: “Excuse me, do any of you gentle-
men ’appen to know a man be the name of (leorge
Pyzer?” None of us had the honor of his acquaint-
ance. “You haven’t heard of him?” We hadn't.
“I hope I’m not on the wrong track,” she mused,
as she returned disappointedly to her seat. “If I
am, ’twill be all the worse for you, Pyzer, when I
do get hold of you again.” We elicited from our
driver at the next gate that Mr, Pyzer was her “law-
ful wedded Yisband,” who had left her two years ago
for the shearing sheds. Advertisements to the effect
that information concerning his whereabouts would
be gladly received by his anxious wife being unfruit-
ful, she had set out to find him, travelling by coach
or other vehicle when she could get a lift, and tramp-
ing when nothing else availed. “Pyzer hadn’t much
sense when he married her,” said the driver; “but
he seems to have got some lately.”

“Rag”: “Peri-Winkle” (B. 25/3/’l5)
need have no anxiety about the overland exodus of
the fresh-water, tortoise from Swan Hill (Vic.).
They may not do the journey as o.uickly as Birtles
could, biit they're much more certain to arrive at
their destination, A three months’ abstinence from
tucker is quite the usual thing in their family;
and they're armor-plated so thick (even the
youngest) that : a hawk or crow would reckon a
porcupine a dead-easy prey compared with these
leisurely, shell-backs. And, if they’re out of their
teens, cocky’s cart would have to be loaded with
more than atmosphere before it seriously inconveni-
enced them. About the only chance of misadven-
ture for Mr. Tortoise in a cross-country expedition is
that he.’might fall over a precipice and land on his
back, sd that his logs could not connect with terra
firma.
* * * *
“Roy C.”: Here’s good damper every
time. Firstly, cream of tartar and soda, mixed in
proportions of 2A c.t. to one of soda, and use two tea-
spoonfuls of this mixture to every pint of flour.
Secondly (most important), be sure to get the
dynamite sifted thoroughly through the flour. This
may be accomplished best by putting all through a
sieve after the powder has been added to flour.
Thirdly, put a small teaspOOnful of good fat to each
pint flour. Mix in well. Add water, in proportion
of half water to flour, i.e., to every two pints flour
one pint water. Fourthly, pop into hot camp oven
or coals; Four-pint damper should be cooked in 35
minutes. The fat may be left out, but it has the
advantage of making up a fine crust and of prevent-
ing the, damper staling as quickly as it otherwise
would do.
NO ENCUMBRANCES.
H E: “Been married five years, eh? Have
they any children?
SHE: “No. Their cook objects to children."
“Moana” : How’s this for a record yield
of wool, from a single jumbuck outside the stud
class? A cocky named Jenkins at Wallacetown
(M.L.) recently took the wool off a crossbred
hogget and found the staple to be 15in. and the
weight of the fleece 201 b. He sold the wool for
10d., so the return from the clip off the one sheep
was 16s. Bd. If it isn’t a record it’s a good
imitation.

From “George Hooligan”
Grant Ilervev is at Long Bay, and still beating the
big drum. Regretful? Not a bit of it! Wouldn’t
have missed the experience on any account, and
reckons he has enough copy material to bring him
in much cash. He still intends appealing to the
higher Court. Hence he is not treated at Long Bay
as an ordinary prisoner, but is called an appellant,
which gives him the doubtful privilege of wearing
civilian clot Iks. But if his appeal is dropped or
does not succeed, the three months that he has done
in gaol will not be counted, and he will have to
commence the whole thing over again at Bathurst.

Probably the first Polar explorer to
settle in Australia was a seaman named
Hepburn, who accompanied Sir John Frank-
lin. He became the skipper of a coasting
boat, prospered, and, buying land in the
Ballarat district, settled and founded the
fortunes of a numerous family at Smeaton.
As Agent-General for N. S. Wales, Tim
Coghlan is the last of a line which began
with one Edward Barnard in 1824, though
he was merely termed “Colonial Agent resi-
dent in London.” He had a salary of £6OO
a year, and drew it till the early ’4o’s. In
1846 the Legislative Council passed an Act
to appoint Francis Scott agent for three
years at a salary of £5OO. In 1863 Edward
W. T. Hamilton, one of the directors of the
A. A. Co., was given the job; but in the
following year the Martin Ministry deter-
mined to appoint an Agent-General with
colonial experience, and selected William
Colburn Mayne, Auditor-General and for-
merly Inspector-General of Police. Mayne
held the position till 1870, when he was
succeeded by Charles Cowper, followed in
1876 by William Foster, and in 1880 by
Saul Samuel. That voluble vituperator had
a long reign till 1898. Then Daniel Cooper
and Julian Salomons were stopgaps till
1900, when Henry Copeland arrived and
remained till the useful Coghlan displaced
him in 1904.
REINFORCEMENTS.
The only daughter of the Kaiser, who was married
in May, 1913, to Prince Ernst of Cumberland, Duke
of Brunswick, has given birth to a son.— Cable.
Wellington (M.L.) has a fine type of sea-
man in its new harbor-master, Captain J. E.
Dawson. He is native-born and has ruffled
it with old Father Neptune since he (Daw-
son, not Nep) was 15. For a while he helped
to shake along that marvellous tea clipper,
the Cuttysark, and was aboard her on the
occasion when she tore through 353 miles of
blue water in 24 hours. That same ship once
made the passage from London to Brisbane
in 69 days.
Lord Northland, son of ex-Governor Ran-
furly, of Maoriland, was well known in
Massey’s Loanly Land, where he was A.D.C.
to his father and shared his great popu-
larity. The young man (he was only 32
when a German bullet ended him in France
recently) married a daughter of Sir Daniel
Cooper three years ago. He crowded a lot
of experience into his short span—explora-
tions and huntings in North Africa, the Ama-
zon regions, the Andes, and many other
places, besides two wars. He served with
the Coldstreams in the Boer incident. The
parents took the loss of their only son very
hardly. “Our interest in life is broken,”
Lord Ranfurly wrote to M.L. friends.
The Angas memorial, put up by the
family in memory of two old colonists
of S. Aus., has been allotted a site on the
lawns of North Terrace, Adelaide, outside
Government House wall. It consists of a
green marble pillar, with bronze plates
affixed, having the heads of George Fife
Angas (1789 to 1579). “patriot, politician,
philanthropist,” and John Howard Angas
(1823 to 1904), “pioneer, pastoralist, phil-
anthropist.” The father had the bigger
chances. One bronze relief shows the emi-
gration “for a land of freedom” of the
German colonists whom he assisted to escape
from Prussian tyranny in the eighteen-
forties, and who have perpetuated such a
good Australian stock in South Aus.
Another picture boldly claims Maoriland as
“saved for Great Britain, 1840,” and shows
the North and South Islands entirely sur-
rounded by two old-fashioned war-frigates
about as big as the islands themselves.
The other sides show wool-teams (horses and
oxen —possibly the best picture of the four),
and the proclamation of S.A., by the his-
toric bent gum-tree, in 1836. The pillar
stands under a canopy supported by high
white marble columns, giving the * whole
thing a rather funereal aspect.
There probably never was in Australia
such a family-party Ministry as the one just
formed in Adelaide. Crawford Vaughan,
Premier and Treasurer, and J. H. Vaughan,
Attorney-General, are brothers—sons of the
man who was for years the S.A. Govern-
ment’s map-printer. Goode, Minister for
Lands and Agriculture, is the Premier’s
brother-in-law. These three make half the
Ministry, and the more important half. But
there is this to be said: though the heavy-
weight half is thus related, the Caucus
chose them, and (given their selection)
their places were plainly marked out before-
hand.
A. H. Peake, late Premier of S. Aus., was
defeated by an ex-police constable for the
district of Victoria the other day. This was
the same district that the poet Adam Lind-
say Gordon represented in the S.A. Parlia-
ment in the ’6o’s. The poet, himself for-
merly a police trooper, defeated Randolph
Isham Stow, afterwards Justice Stow.
Gordon referred to his opponent in his “Sea
Spray and Smoke Drift”:—
bike Stow at our hustings, confronting the hisses
Of roughs with his queer Mephistonheles smile.
You couldn’t stop some men with a case
of axes. When the Gerhog started wallow-
ing a Russian Finn dropped into Victoria
Barracks (Sydney) and applied to be en-
rolled for service. The doctor, having
located a growth at the base of his spine,
fired him out. Ivan made for the most
convenient hospital, had the growth removed
and faced the military doctor once more.
He was fired again—this time because of a
varicose vein, extending down the left leg
from groin to ankle. He patiently plodded
back to hospital, got the vein cut out —the
wound took S 4 stitches —and his first walk
when the hospital people let him go was
back to the barracks. This time the verdict
was his, and he passed gleefully along to
training. God Help the Gerhog that Finn
meets when he means business!

tice A. 11. Simpson’s sons went away with

Barton, J., Higgins, J., and Rich. J.. are
represented. Ex-C.J. Parker, of Westralia,
farewelled three sons when Australia’s first
lot of soldiers departed, and one of them
has given up his life in the Great Capse.
And a hopeful of Justice Cussen’s (Vic.)

One of tlie five survivors of H.M.S. Good-
hope, sunk off the Chilian coast by the
German warships that followed her to the
bottom on a suosequent auspicious occasion,
was a Maorilander named Arthur L. Forbes.
It was his luck to be landed with four com-
rades on a small island for observation pur-
poses a few days previous to the calamity.
One day last week the P.L.L. Conference
at Sydney had a woman in the chair and
another in the vice-cliair. The latter was
Mrs. Melville; the chairwoman was Mrs.
Kate Dwyer, who as vice-president of the
P.L.L. stepped into Meagher’s job in his
absences. Mrs. Dwyer was originally one of
the Goldings, who were leading agitators for
woman suffrage when it was a theme for jest.
Since then she has been recognised as the
chief spokeswoman for the feminine side of
Labor politics, and has, amongst other things,
been given a place on the Cost of Living
Commission and the Housing Board. Her
husband is a schoolmaster. Labor women
expect her to be the first female M.L.C. In
fact, there was great indignation amongst
them that she was not in the first batch of
Labor’s appointments to the State’s Supper
-House.
“Monkbarns”: A mention (B. 8/4/’l5) of
John Thomas Smith, Melbourne’s Whitting-
ton, seven times Mayor, excites me to a
little biography. He was a timber merchant
in Sydney, where his partner was Mark
Last, who took to the boards as tragedian
under the name of Morton King, and was
afterwards known in Melbourne as Mark
Last King, auctioneer, magistrate and M.P.
Smith turned publican in Melbourne, his
hotel being on the corner of Queen and Little
Collins streets. Adjoining it he built the
Queen’s Theatre, which was opened in 1845
by Nesbitt in “The Bear Hunters” and
“Black Eyed Susan.” Mr. and Mrs. Coppin
came there from Launceston three months
afterwards, opening with “The Lady of
Lyons.” Smith was a somewhat eminent
Freemason and strong Anglican churchman,
much concerned with St. James’s, although
that was really named after a larger bene-
factor, James Smith—not the litterateur.
J. T. Smith, as Mayor, went to England,
with expectation of being the first Mel-
bourne Knight. He was accompanied by the
Rev. C. T. Perks, of St. Stephen’s, Rich-
mond, as chaplain. Smith interviewed Queen
1 ictoria, who is reported to have said after-
wards that he was too vulgar for an “honor.”
Really, though, lie was a superior man, pos-
sessed of great firmness and decision. Long
lie was a member oF Parliament, and for
some time Minister of Mines, although, to
start with, he knew as much about mining as
his white hat, shirt frill or familiar short
cutty pipe.

Much has happened since the half-year
covered by the last line. But it is amazing
how little difference has thus far been made
in Australian private finance, taking it as a
whole. For the first few weeks there was a
slump in the market value of securities, then
a recovery started, and most Australian
stocks are back to where they were (say)
18 months ago. As a matter of fact, many
stocks would be weaker than they are to-day
if there had been no war; for in deciding
that the war isn’t going to hurt us, and
therefore that stocks shouldn’t suffer, we
have prevented the very serious drought
having the effect on prices which it would
have had if it had come alone.
All the same, what we have to consider
now is the probable effect supposing the war
lasts two or three or more years. It may
come to an end pretty suddenly; on the
other hand, accounts such as that recently
given to the London Times by a neutral
don’t hold out any bright hopes. His report
was that trains are running as usual in
Germany; dining cars are providing the
same old tucker at the same old cheap rate;
the shortage of petrol isn’t giving any con-
cern. because it has been replaced by coal
oil; low-grade copper mines are being opened
up in a leisurely way to ease a situation
which isn’t yet serious; auid most obviously
there were still large reserves of able-bodied
men to draw upon. There really was no
single reason for expecting that the defeat
of Germany, prepared to the last button
and confident to the last man, would be a
cakewalk. But we have humbugged our-
selves a good deal. It is far better to settle
down to this: that whether it takes six
months or six years the result has to be
exactly the same; and, if he hasn’t done so
before, the prudent man will begin to think
in years, and make his preparations accord-
ingly.
How will it affect us in Australia?
Largely that depends upon Governments.
So far as N. S. Wales is concerned, no
country could well be more unfortunate. The
thing to aim at above all else is the increase
of our products, with a reduction of the bill
for outside goods. In short, the country
ought to do what any sane citizen would do
if faced with trouble and an unforeseen
expense of great but uncertain size. In-
stead, the N. S. Wales Government, on
being begged to keep away from the money
market because the Empire would probably
require the last bean raisable there, lias
decided to crawl in by a backstairs ; and it
does it not in order to increase the imme-
diate production of the country, but admit-
tedly to keep 20,000 or more men at jobs
which are. not directly productive. We shall
pay for it presently. Meantime observe
that for the first eight months of the current
fiscal year—July 1 to February 28 —the
Commonwealth imports were valued at
144.830 645, while the exports were only
£39,179,644. That is to say, we didn’t pay
our way by £5,651,001 plus all the interest
on all our foreign debt, public and private.
Certainly we had a good deal of wool on
hand, but allowing for that we should pro-
bably be about £7.000.000 to the bad on the
eight months. A country which spends
£10,000.000 a year more than it earns can
have only one end —unless it sees what is
ahead of .it, throws its traitorous guides into
the handiest ditch and clears back.
Australia is at present taking the easy
way. and the bill will come in by-and-bye.
Nothing but another run of extra-good years
can save us from very serious depression;
and a continuance of its present misgovern-
ment will deepen the trouble in N. S. Wales.
With a protracted war and two or three
indifferent seasons, the depression is going
to be worse than it is pleasant to think
about. That is the biggest danger ahead of
the Union and other banks. Like the rest
of us, they are sharing in a bogus prosperity.
They are discounting the future. The most
comforting feature of the case so far as the
Union Bank is concerned is that it seems to
recognise all this. Hence, besides the visible
reserves, it has amassed such large internal
reserves that they more than provide for
all ascertained depreciation of securities
since the war started. And as for the
future the chairman spoke, no doubt, the
simple truth when he told shareholders on
February 1: “It is never wise to prophesy,
and on this occasion it is impossible. All I
can say is this: the Union Bank is in as
good a position as any other institution to
meet adverse conditions, should they arise,
or to take advantage of any good business
which may offer.”

“The war now raging has to some extent
interfered with business, and the co., in
common with others, has felt its effects,”
the d i recto rs say, till king the tripe of the
moment. The chances are that, if anything,
the war has added to the co.’s output of
beef. In fact, the public is turning on the
brewer and the hotel-keeper, and rending him
on that very account. Whether Bung and the
brewer are going to suffer serious permanent
injury as the result isn’t certain; but, at
any rate, they have all to lose and nothing
to gain. There are, therefore, more risks in
Brewery stocks than there have been hitherto ;
and,' generally speaking, the bigger the hold-
ing of pub property the bigger the risk the
capital has to carry.
Perkins and Co. got into trouble during
the Queensland boom of 20-odd years ago
through borrowing to buy pubs at outrageous
prices and to finance publicans. When the
bubble broke the mess seemed so dreadful
that the capital was written down to
£58.683—133,334 shares at 155., of which
55,556 were unallotted. It was really much
too violent a writing-down ; and some years
afterwards capital was restored to the
extent of £41,667 by the issue of the reserve
shares, Subsequently, the shares were in-
creased to 177,778 by the issue of 44,444
at a premium of ss. (£1 for the 15s. shares).
Now, as the average profit on the watered
capital is still very nearly 20 p.c., the direc-
tors have decided to scatter another 88,889
shares—one for every two at present held.
This will, at any ..rate, make the rate of
dividend look more moderate, even though a
bit more in the aggregate is cut up—provided
it is there to cut up.
The distinctly unsatisfactory feature of
the business is that the average of profits is
less now than it was 10 years ago, notwith-
standing that meantime £44,444 of new-
capital has been got in, over £60,000 of re-
serves have reputedly been-accumulated and
over £55,000 more debt has been shouldered.
The co. is thus making less profit than it did
10 years ago, when it had £lOO,OOO less capi-
tal of its ow-n and £55,000 less of other
people’s risked in the business. Seeing that
in the matter of population Queensland has
made fair strides in the 10 years, and seeing
also that the markets for the staples of the
State have of late vastly improved, the com-
parison suggests that Perkins’s hasn’t been
keeping its grip. Chairman and general-
manager have both died within tlm past year,
so that things may now show some change
one Avay or the other.

This co., which imported the Six Hatters

but the public wasn’t interested until three
or four years ago. At that time the capital

since that it has now- disappeared altogether
—a highly _ creditable three years’ perform-
ance, especially as a 10 p.c. diy. was paid
until the past year, when discretion pulled it
down to 8 p.e. A couple of- years aeo the
co. owed £13,185 in addition to £20.000
secured to the bank by debentures, and it had
in cash and on deposit £21.495. Now it
ow-es £5723. besides the £20.000, and it has
in cash and on deposit £25,013. The cash
position has thus improved by £10,980 in
two years—four-fifths by the accumulation
of profit, one-fifth by the conversion of stock,
etc., into cash. The result is almost too
good to be true of an Australian manufac-
turing concern.

P*ut there is a good deal of estimate about
that last line. The w-00l clip from 134.731
sheep and lambs totalled 2063 bales' of
greasy and 683 bales of scoured, and none
or it had been sold at the time the report
was written. The clip was valued at
£23,341, or £19,897 net. It was probably
worth more, owing to the recent improve-
ment of the market. This comparison sug-
gests that the estimate was conservative :—-
Greasy. Scoured. Value.

1913 .. 1840 477 28,581
1914 .. 2063 683 23,341
The figures for the first two years arc the
actual receipts. The margin allowed for
contingencies in the estimate for the past
year is therefore very wide. The co.. which
owns the Bundalear and Thurulgoona sta-
tions, over the Queensland border, started
off by paying far too much for the proper-
ties, and a heavy debt, aggravated by rab-
bits and poor markets, made things look
very blue for shareholders for many years.
More recently the results and prospects
have been much better, largely, of course,
through the great improvement in live-stock
values. Last year 29,943 sheep were sold
off-shears, but the co. can’t always do as
ivell as that.
In addition to the sums shown above
as profits considerable amounts spent on
improvements have been written off.
These have to be kept in mind when taking
a general view of the course of profits shown

represent £215,443 of the capital (£292,005) .
And the co. doesn’t own the run. A slice of
319 sq. miles is even now due for resump-
tion, and notice thereof has been given; the
other 1018- sq. miles are on lease for 20 years.
The co. has. tenant right in improvements;
that is, the ingoing tenants have to pay the
co. for the A r alue of the improvements to
them. However, the bulk of the value is in
the lease, which apparently hasn’t been
written down ; and for that reason the direc-
tors recommended shareholders to regard
half of the 1913 dividend as return of
capital". These other figures show the more
liquid assets :

When this century opened the co. had a
mortgage of about £00.000; so it has made
very fair progress. It claims now (4?ay)
£lOO,OOO of assets apart from the liked pro-
perty. No doubt they are worth inort'i 1 for
the stock is under-valued. With average
years, and the chances of a renewal of the
lease of portion at any rate of the holding,
the outlook is thus vastly better than it was
15 years ago. Yet the long run of poor
dividends or no dividends at all makes the
60s. share still worth a fraction less than
half that much in the market.

A solid concern this, financed mostly by the
cautious Scotchmen whose sheep grow fat,
or else.,,die of cold, between **he Bluff and
Wakati"pu. Look at these figures for 10
years:—■ Uuo.
Paid in dividends £35,658
Depreciation written off: .. 56,493
Net profits put by ... . . 48,754
Total profits . . . . £140,905
That’s just a shade more than one-fourth
of the gross profits divided, and little more
than 40 p.c. of the net profits. Further,
while large amounts are shown there to have
been written off, considerable further sums
have been spent on repairs and renewals;
and as the total amount thus spent, added
to the amount written off, about equals the
total book value of the land, buildings and
plant 10 years ago, it is pretty clear that
the writing-down has been very hard. Put
in another way, this seems to mean that the
amount shown as added to reserves has
been actually earned in excess of the divi-
dends. Still, the amount has been trifling
during the last couple of years compared
with previous records, the balance on work-
ing account having for some unexplained
reason moved down smartly. Apparently the
local price of live stock has advanced more
rapidly than the price of frozen sheep in the
English market. Nevertheless, sweeping in a
long period, the co.’s record is a very solid
one.
Looking into details, the Southland Co.
shows these comparisons :

Other assets 10,313 17,009 10,714 8,948 10,135
Considering that no capital has been actu-
ally got in during these years, and consider-
ing, also, the big expenditure on works
(something over £BO,OOO must have gone
that way altogether in the 11 years), the co.
has kept out of debt remarkably well. The
self-sacrifice of the shareholders ought really
to be producing them now more than S p.c.
But if they are not getting it one way they
are another; for this is practically a co-
operative concern, owned by the growers
themselves.

This co. is the first to assume an inter-State
character. To do that, after entering into
its own recognisances to be of good behavior
in Victoria, it had to get a bill first through
the Queensland and recently through the
N. S. Wales Parliament. Operations have
only just been started in Sydney, financial
provision having been made by the issue of
2(5.178 reserved £1 shares chiefly among wool
and sheep people, who are now expected to
die without any unseemly delay and give the
new branch something to dp. With the new
capital, issued at 4s. premium, the total paid
up will be £lOO,OOO, which is more than a
reasonable guarantee fund for clients and
beneficiaries; and the reserves will be lifted
to over £20,000. Further, the reserves are
actual reserves; there is no doubt about all
the co.'s funds being represented by solid
stuff. Before the co. had cut its wisdom
teeth it put most of its money into mort-
gages. Nowadays, what money isn’t in pub-
lic securities or on deposit is in office pre-
mises. During the year a £6OOO purchase
was made at Brisbane; and with £44,474
spent on premises bought in Melbourne in
.1911 no less than £50,474 is now in city
freeholds. Perhaps they may shrink in
value, as the mortgages did. But, in that
case, they will come again ; and, meantime,
the co. has its office accommodation. As for
the shares as an investment note (1) that
the capital is much larger than that of those
trustees cos. which have been paying a very
easy 10 p.c., and (2) that the Public Trustee
Office in N. 8. Wales is starting to cut com-
missions, and, being virtually forbidden to
make profits, is a tough competitor to be up
against.

At the top of the table there is something of
an intro, to this dealer in old bones and
bottles. For the rest, it can be said that,
having bought a turn-out. and more or less
worked out one district, it decided to make
use of its plan! by opening up a new area ;
hence the purchase a couple of years or so
back of the bones of the Land Mortgage
Bank.
This Freehold .Assets Co. and one or two
other concerns in. the same line of business
have turned out splendidly for a few of the
optimists who, being on hand at the time of
the great boom, of course came a cropper.
When the old boom smashed and the opti-
mist was too much of a wreck to count, the
pessimist took charge, and the way he valued
properties and wrote assets down was almost
as absurd as the way the optimist pad puffed
them up. After a few years the marvellous
resilience of Australia began to tell, and
things started to go the way of the optimists
again. Then cos. such as this were formed
or acquired : this one has “big Bill” Baillieu
as chairman, with the faithful Wharton to
say “I second that —carried,” there being but
three directors. Until towards the middle of
last year—anyway, until the harvest before
last—they all had a great time, realising on
properties at a profit, or getting rents which
showed 8 p.c. to 10 p.c. on the pessimists’
value.
Most of the sales are made on terms; and
the expected profits from uncompleted trans-
actions are not included in the foregoing
table. They are put to a realisation suspense
account, which is now £21.080 in credit. If
this profit is finally realised, and if only 20s.
in the £ is got for other assets, then the
74,245 shares (£1 each) are represented by
£121,693 net of assets —say, 335. per share
after payment of the dividend. Whether the
property will average 20s. in the £ is, of
course, to be proved. This shows what the
assets are:—
1908. 1913. 1914.
Liabilities .. ..£89,954 £85,829 £107,748
Realisation suspense a/e. 7,460 19,787 21,080

Balances owing . . 58,440 26,133 35,530
Other assets . . .. 46,589 11,547 23,269
So the co. carries a fair risk —it has borrowed ,
approximately as much as its own funds,
and by far the greater part of the lot is
represented by property and unpaid balances
on property .sold. The latter is really what
the “shares in other cos.” consists of. If
isn’t much of a time to be stuck with pro-
perty for sale, even though that property has
hitherto been saleable at a profit; it isn’t
much of a time to even have a lot of money
out on time-payment property sales. Still,
if things are sick for a while, the experience
of these people will satisfy them that they

The Bulletin, dealing with trustee cos.,
has often said that inevitably they would
have to cut down their charges. Admittedly
they did much more for their 24 or 5 p.c.
than most other commission agents; but
the fact is their work is specially attractive
to the State (there is a Public: Trust Office
even in Great Britain), and a competing
State Office has merely to pay exes.—it
hasn’t to earn interest on any capital at all.
The N.S.W. cos. are now actually up against
this competition. At the beginning of last
year a Public Trust Office was opened in
Sydney, and recently it has made a second
cut at charges. In notifying it the Office
sa ys:—
The Act provides that no profit shall be made
upon the transactions of the office, the fees and
charges; being- fixed at a rate sufficient to meet the
expenses of the office, and no more. Although at
the inception of the office those fees and charges
were fixed at the rates charged by similar offices
in tin's a lid other States, the volume of business has
been so; great and the expenses of management kept
down so, that notwithstanding a large increase of
the staff a fair profit has.been made.
The principal reductions have been: Upon
intestate estates over £250, and upon the
capital realised in executor or trustee
estates up to £lO,OOO, from 24 p.c. to 2 p.c.;
upon income from rents, from 5 p.c. to
24 p.c.; upon other income, from 24 p.c. to
14 p.c.

The Carpathia, at Ardlethan, has been
doing a good deal better of late ; and when
the concentrates in hand are sold there
should be enough money to spare for a divi-
dend. The co. has something like £2250 in
cash, and close-up £4OOO in product. The
latter, however, isn’t going-off very well just
at present. The White Crystal has another
engine in, and in consequence at the mill the
10-head are now at work. But the available
stone is wretchedly poor. Wild Cherry,
though it has a fair quantity of water in the
dam, hasn’t started to crush. The trouble is
that even rain doesn’t bring ore; Southern
Cross (paid) have had sales at 3d. The
assets are, of course, worth a good deal more
than that. The market says, in effect, that
the longer the concern works the more money
it will lose, and the less there will be left,
for shareholders.

Bangadang (N.S.W.) is still trying to
prbve : itself a mine. So far the various
makes . of mineralised ore that have
been discovered haven’t been connected up;
but costeening is still being done between
No. 1 and No. 2 shafts, in the; hope that a
shoot of mineral may be picked up, and a
link thus established. Last week the “winze
lode” gave assays averaging 205., and from
No. 2 -shaft the bulk sample assayed 80s. per
ton. The best gold values are associated
with arsenical pyrites and gelena, but the
heavy mineral is very patchy.
Westralia produced gold valued at
£296.790 during the March quarter, or
£11,158 less than for the same period in
1914, which was £4486 ahead of the 1913
term. Fewer men are now engaged in the
industry than at any time since Coolgardie
was discovered, and profits are shrinking.
A Chamber of Mines statistical statement
shows that during the past 10 years profit
per ton of ore has diminished from 16s. lOd.
to ss. lid., and the number of workers,
exclusive of alluvialists and prospectors,
from 16,848 to 11,722. In other words,
5126 men, whose output totalled £1,025,200,
have gone out of the industry.

Mine-owners in the West are greatly per-
turbed by the duty of £4 10s. on imported
zinc sheets. Stocks of zinc shavings began
to run short soon after the war started, and
to prevent a collapse the Chamber of Mines
purchased 300 tons of spelter from the
Broken Ilill Prop, and made contracts for
big shipments of zinc sheets from U.S.A.
at famine prices. The duty on the
American consignments lias been paid
under protest by the Chamber, which has
applied for a refund on the ground that the
sheets could not at the time they were
ordered be produced in Australia. Which
is not true. They could have been pro-
duced in Australia just as well a year or
two years or three years ago as they can
to-day. The fault was that there was then
no sufficient duty and no war to compel the
unpatriotic mine-owners of the West to
purchase Australian goods.
•>r * * *
Bullfinch Prop. ("W.A.) thinks it has
struck at 400 ft. the downward continuation
of the rich shoot on which the mine for a
time boomed. So far assays range from
4oz. to 7dwt„ hut shareholders are
encouraged to hope that values may improve
in driving.
Any sort of flotation seems to be good
enough for Westonia (W.A.). Edna May
Junction is the latest. According to the
prospectus, its mission in life is to make a
mine out of SS acres of bush south of the
Edna May and Edna May Central. Prac-
tically no work has been done on the pro-
perty, and apart from the few admiring
remarks made in the accompanying reports,
all that it apparently has to recommend it
is that an uninterrupted view of the Edna
May can be obtained from the dump, and that
there is a pub within easy walking distance.
Vendors are to be given nearly 50 per cent,
of the shares and £l5OO to boot. Most of
the Westonia areas that have been floated
during the past month’s boom or are about
to be put before the public have only cost
the owners the price of pegging, pot-holing,
etc., or at the most a few hundreds; and
most of them are highly speculative ventures
for which a cash consideration ought to be
entirely out of the question.
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) elated over
recent developments at the No. 20 level.
Nearly five years ago Dr. Maclaren broke
the sad news to the Board in London that
an intrusion of epidiorite had ruined the
south end of the ! Nos. 17 and 18 levels, and
if further development proved this despoiler
to be solid rock and not a mere spur, that
portion of the mine was done for. The Nos.
19 and 20 levels were expected to decide
the matter, and as a winze sunk between
these two points was unpayable it looked
as if the worst had happened. Now recent
work south on No. 20 level has exposed a
stretch of £5 ore, and stone of the same
value is being got in a winze going down
from that level.

Pained surprise is at last officially
expressed at the way Siberia Consols
(W.A.) is turning out, and operations will
probably cease in a few weeks. The
Bulletin was dubious about this show
from the start, but those spruiking for it
on the Adelaide market reckoned that it: had
first-rate prospects and would pay good
dividends in time. Now the admission is
made that nothing has been found to justify
the erection of a mill.

From "Westonia (W.A.) : Local share-

of the Edna May Central plans in order to
see the exact position of No. 1 winze in
relation to the joint boundary of the Edna
May and Central. The half-yearly report
of the co. was all right in its way, but there
are several points on which information is
wanted. One is the value of the deposit of
water-worn quartz or alluvial mentioned by
the management: another is the approxi-
mate tonnage and value of the ore in sight;
a thjrd is an explanation of that portion of
the import, which says: “After leaving the
shaft the . reef becomes irregular for some
distance until the make of stone on which
the No, 2 winze was sunk is reached. This
was a strong body of stone Bft. wide and
pitching to the west, and should be met
with in the shaft in the next sinking.”
Seeing the winze is sunk west of the main
shaft and the stone is stated to be pitching
in that direction, it is hard to understand
how further sinking of the shaft is going to
disclose a continuation of the body. Special
attention is drawn to the efficiency of the
treatment plant: yet it is not doing the duty
of a similar plant on the Edna May.
The buck-up of Duke Extended. Mary-
borough (lie.), is based on something tan-
gible. The field of wash which was to have
given ounce returns and decent Board fees
was as limited as the war gifts of some of the
big Melbourne mining guns. So the tally of
the last puddling campaign was only 6820 z.
from 891 fathoms. This average was fair, but
the quantity of dirt stoped was miserably
low. Now the management is digging vigor-
ously off the Nos. 3. 4 and 5 rises, and it has
put up bores round No. 5 rise 300 ft. farther
along the gutter. Showy prospects are
reported, and as over 5000 fathoms are
nearly ripe for panelling a good chance
exists of the puddlers getting the rust off
the bearings at an early date. Still it would
be wiser policy to hold off this ground for
another three months to get more water
squeezed out of the wash. On developments
to the north-east the co. has snapped up a
new lease to the south-west, believing the
main gutter to run thither. If so. then old
Sam Body’s theory, that the main gutter
couldn’t turn north-east, works out correct.
The cash position of Al. Gaffney’s (Vic),
is vastly different from what it was when
George Dickenson got the mine on the move.
The old element is represented by Edward
Miller, of the money-bags, a good prop to
have when times are hard. T. J. Greenway
stands for metallurgy—when it is wanted.
That isn’t often, because when gold shows in
the floors at the Al, no special device is
needed to save it. Al’s special mission to-
day is not only to pay dividends and be flirty
with the share market, but to disprove the old
set idea that the dykes in the hill districts
won’t carry payable quartz at depth. No
one believed Al would ever rejoice in a
second advent. Yet now it is developing five
floors of quartz between Nos. S and 10 levels,
and payable stone is underfoot in the bottom
workings. The programme therefore is to
sink 150 ft. If floors are got there, surely
some plucky soul ought to have a go at the
Wood’s Point formations. Several of these
were jewellers’ shops near the surface, but
because geologists preached that floors
couldn’t make at depth in the compact green-
stone there, work stopped and plant went to
the hammer. Someone is up and doing at
New Loch Fyne, the forfeiture of that old
claim having been allowed. If such a veteran
gets going again, the more reason why Wood’s
Point should awaken.
Some New England and Stanthorpe people
claim to have sinfully wasted a bottle of
champagne over the fly-wheel at the resur-
rected Sundown copper and tin mine at
Ballaudean (Q.) the other day. W. W.
Welsby has stuck to the property for years,
and now a co. has come to his rescue and
there is a suction-gas plant, 10 head of
stamps, Wilfleys and Berdan pans, with 10
tons of tin oxide to show for the first run
of S 4 hours. The co. has its office at
Armidale.
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, is still
in the doldrums. During the past half-year
5260 tons were crushed for £18,217; average
60s. per ton. The profit, after providing
£702 for depreciation, was only £1172,
which isn’t ss. per ton. Certainly a good
deal of development was done, and the fact
that No. 8 (2750 ft.) shows payable ore for
152 ft. is encouraging. The stone along this
level is said to be “sprinkled with visible
gold.” But that doesn’t alter the fact that
a recent crushing averaged only 50s.
* * * *
Papuan Brilliant and Victoria, Charters
Towers, announces another 3d. dividend, and
the cross reef now being worked will pro-
vide a few more. An underlay shaft has
been sunk 2S7ft. on this reef, and for most
of the distance a highly mineralised little
reef, from 2in. to Gin. wide, has been fol-
lowed. Some of the stopes show from fiin.
to lOin. of payable stone, but it becomes
irregular as the drives are extended north
and south. The reef has become larger
near the bottom of the shaft, but the quality
has fallen away. During the half-year 811
tons were crushed for £8556, an average of
£lO 11s. per ton. There are 96.000 shares
and the market is at about 2s. od.. or
£12.000 for the lot. The Papuan paid two
3d dividends (£2400) last half-year, and at
that rate 2s. 6d. will be paid in 24 years.
Still a ribbon of prill ore isn’t much to hang-
on at the best of times, and the Moonstone
is a patchy locality.
Cecil ft. Ryan’s last screed on the Pioneer
tin. Bradshaw’s Creek (Tas.), is in the
minor key. Causes: a jump of about Id. per
cubic yard in costs, owing primarily to the
cutting out of the metal market when war
began ; and. the need to prepare fresh sluicing
faces in the new paddock. Still Cecil G.
Ryan can write of 6 682,900 cub. yds. sluiced
since 1900 for 5396 tons tin oxide, at an
average cost of 6ld. per cub. yd. There is
a decimal more, hut that needn't be worried
over in view of the amount of cash that has
flown as profits to the Gibbs Bright crowd
since they got hold of the mine. With better
appliances and bigger power, costs now are
down at 4.715 d. per cub. yd.; but the average
grade of the drift has receded from about
1.84 d. per cub. yd. to 14d. The difference
doesn’t look much in print, but it mounts
up when big quantities are handled. As a
side show the co. runs the Argonaut, near
the East Coast. Creek flats contain the tin.
and a lower average than at the Pioneer
pays well; hut the area suffers more from
water shortage than the Pioneer; so there
is more time there to talk over the enormi-
ties of Kaiser -Bill. Both shows want rain,
and with that should shell out divs. for a
long time ahead.
* * * *
Mount Jasper (Tas.) recently had one of
its occasional flutters in Melbourne: but
there was no news at the mine to justify
any movement at all. In fact, it is doubtful
whether there is anything at the mine to
justify any market at all. There is cer-
tainly not enough pavable ore in sight to
keep the 10-stamp concentrating mill going
a fortnight. In that respect, however, the
mine about matches most of the plant, which
is a hopeless outfit altogether. Still, it all
does to hang a gamble on.
*■ * *
From George D. Mend<4l: —-
It Dr. Wade be correct in stating “most of our
time in S. Australia was spent in making- geological
surveys just as in the Possession” (Papua), he thereby
weakens the value of his bulletin on oil prospects
in Papua. I ask him: Did lie make a geological
survey of the. South-Eastern district of S.A. from'
Kingston to Mount Gambler? We who are inter-
ested know he visited the district in a motor-car.
If he made more than a flying traverse, when did he
make it? Why did he not go and see the S.A.
Oil Wells Co.’s bore, eight miles from Kobe, then
down to 400 ft.? Why did lie not call at the King-
ston bore and ask to see the log? Why did he not
spend the five months in the S.E. of S.A., where the
rocks are tertiary, sandstones, mudstones, limestones
and shales, the strata indicative of petroleum the
wide world over, instead of spending time on Eyre’s
Peninsula and Kangaroo Island, where the rocks are
primary and mostly granite? Why did he not
minutely examine the locality in S.A. where the
practical oilmen say petroleum is most likely to be
found, and where the only two oil-wells in Australia
are being drilled ? He makes some reference to
geological maps. Proof that no field work of value
has ever been done by the Government Geologist's
branch of the S.A. Mines Department is given by
Dr. Wade himself in numbering his defence of that
fast-asleep office, “Bulletin No. 4.” Four bulletins in
50 years of existence!
**\ * *
All the way from Egypt:—
With reference to Dr. A. Scheidel, managing
director of the Commonwealth (N.S.W.) Port-
land Cement Co. (B. 10/12/’l4). He was not the
founder of one of Australia’s big industries. Old
David Mitchell, of Melbourne, “Was the earliest maker
of cement, arid, I believe, is still making- it. It is
true that Dr. Scheidel’s co. has probably made more
cement than any other Australian concern; but 1
don’t know whether that entitles him and it to
three cheers. I only know that I wits Tinder engage-
ment to this company once, and my agreement read
that when 1 severed myself from it I was not to
interest myself in the cement-making business . in
Australia or Maoriland for the term of my life; and
I doubt the Australian patriotism of a co. which
exacted terms of that sort.

MADAME JEANNE BROLA IN ARDUOUS
OPERATIC ROLES.
THE BEAUTIFUL-VOICED SOPRANO WRITES AN
EXPERT MEDICAL OPINION.
It has been the surprise and delight of music-lovers
and theatre-goers to witness the lavish display of
vocal ability and operatic talent so unquestionably
possessed by Madame Jeanne Brola, the distinguished
soprano of the recent Quinlan Opera Company
Many of her singing roles were prominently opposed
to each other, yet she was as much at 'home in
“Madame Butterfly” as in “La Boheme,” and as
much so in “The Girl of the Golden West” as in
“Aida.’ It appeared natural to her in that what-
ever she did she did well. 1
Madame Brola during the 1913 season deservedly
became intensely popular with Australin music-
lovers, but she freely admitted that so great and
exhausting had been her duties that she would nn
doubtedly have suffered FROM A GREAT MFNTat
AND PHYSICAL BREAKDOAVN were it not for the
fact that she took Clements Tonic, the ideal medi-
cine for the artiste and professional. H er tribute tn
this splendid strength-giving and health-preserving
medicine has been often published for the pubi c
good, and should be read by all professional and
commercial persons who at times suffer from brain
fag, anaemia, physical fatigue or nerve weakness.
Ladies of society who suffer from nervousnes?
caused by exacting social duties, and who suffer
from brain-fag or insomnia in consequence should
use this medicine because it induces restful sooth
mg and invigorating sleep. ’ u

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, April 12, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
Sunday morning the G.-G. motored out to
“service” at the Liverpool camp, one of the
cricketing Waddy clerics being chaplain.
Before and after listening to the Word his
Ex., under an armed guard, poked around
among the tents that sprawl along the river
at the slumbrous old town, and of course
was “delighted with all he saw.” There
begins to be some doubt whether he ought
t > have been. The health of the men at
the Liverpool camp isn’t at all what it
should be, and deaths from pneumonia,
supervening on measles, are so numerous
as to suggest a thorough inquiry into the
question whether the camp is where it ought
to be, and _if it is where it ought to be
whether it is what it ought to be. Four or
live miles further on, at Goldsworthy, light
horse and artillery have been in camp, and
there has been no death there at all and
practically no sickness. This seems to give
emphasis to the call for a thorough medical
inquisition concerning the merits (and
otherwise) of the Liverpool site.
Careless souls who took the race ticket
marked “Fourth Day” to Saturday’s meet
were promptly held up at the turnstiles and
stripped of ss. The fact that the tickets
were dated April 10 didn’t move the heart
of the Peri at the gates. So Saturday had
to count as the third day—April 7—in con-
sequence of the course having been under
water earlier in the. week. One of the
few visitors to Randwick on the weepy morn-
ing when further proceedings were postponed
was his Excellency Ferguson, who had lunch
with a few pals before being warned off the
damp premises.
Saturday was warm enough for muslin
frocks, though Woman, as usual, wore her
heaviest winter garb, if it happened to be
her best. . The Munro Ferguson party
changed their boarding-house, escaping from
the Government House pews to court oblivion
in the members’ stand. Excellency Helen,
in a pale-blue frock, showed the same tidy
Huff of feathers on her sedate millinery as
of old. . Little Mrs. Shimizu, in the sub-
regal train for awhile, looked like a pretty
Jap toy in sable upholstery. Consul Shimizu,
who had a life-and-death struggle with the
English language when he first trod this
town, may now be congratulated on chuck-
ling triumphant over its prostrate verbs.
Grey has been one of the subdued notes
of recent race meetings. Even Chief
Justice Cullen understudied the G.-G. in a
more frivolous shade of this Quaker tint,
and his tall lady, though in a darker color,
added but another slim stick of grey to
the landscape. Mrs. Leonard Dangar, in
beautiful dove-like plumage, had an un-
usual kind of winged black velvet toque
perched on her silky locks. Most of the
new hats are uncommon; some of them are
so uncommonly ugly that they’re replicas of
the Rock of Gibraltar and can only be dis-
missed with a caution.
r the matter of summer gowns, Janet
Knox ran away from competition in a white
frock that flared out till it came to a good
end in three pale-blue hands. A saucy little
mid-Victorian hat, with dangling ribbons,
put a top to this charming turnout. Sister
Barbara, in subdued grey, accompanied the
bin e-a nd-white gown. Somehow she re-
minded me of a monologue.
A few precarious attempts to revive the
colors of yesteryear, such as boiled carrots,
underdone beef, and turnip trimmings, were
small side-lines in the Easter shows. But
the tartans and the heavy, dull coatings had
Side whiskers for girls are still fashion-
able. By bringing a small lock of hair well
over the cheek, and gumming or licking it
down, the abbreviated mutton-chop effect
is easily obtained. ,Tean Morton, not long
back from having a look at the Australians
m Egypt, was whiskered in the latest mode
at the races. Auntie Hay, a sister of Mrs.
Phil Morton (who hailed from the Auck-
land district), is quite a tame Y.W.C.A.
edition of the brilliant Morton frocking on
the Randwick lawn. Mrs. Tom Rolin, in a
dark cloth costume, chaperoned a daughter-
in blue.
Sandal shoes are the only details neces-
sary to complete the early-Victorian habits
of the Smart Girl. Dorothy Gordon—a
grand-daugliter of ex-inspector Fosbery—
was heel-and-toed in very new French shoes
at Saturday’s race meet. But her wide,
short skirts, of pale grey, fenced in below
the waist with a gorgeous rose sash, and
Iter small millinery-tartlet with blobs of red
round its pork-pie brim, belonged to the
Trollope period in English fiction, when
Dale played croquet on the lawns at
Allington. Mrs. Kenna’s Garibaldi hat, in
dead-leaf straw, was of the same period.
Her high military coat had the effect of
keeping the neck warm—a digression from
the open-throated blouses of the last year.
Mr. Pudukota, the real Indian rajah in
our midst, is said to admire Sydney girls,
particularly one girl, quite a lot. He turned
out on .Easter Monday in the lavender kid
gloves of Piccadilly. But he got back into
the grey suiting of a work-a-day world at
Saturday’s meet, and was gloved in mustard-
colored kid. Why will a rajah always
hanker for these bilious tints when he casts
aside his petticoats and jewelled turban?
Amongst the unconfirmed rumors that float
round our Pie Commissioner is a tale
of two cities and £2OOO. It is said that
when the massive Australian politician was
sounded as to his desire to go to London and
take his place on the toast list, he was coy.
No pension was pressed on him, and he
argued that when the time came to pack up
again for Sydney he would have to graze in
a very bare paddock. At this a millionaire
pastoralist is alleged to have offered, as a
matter of personal friendship for G. 11. Reid,
to pay him £2OOO a year. The tale has been
revived, now that the packing-up is in sight.
A meeting at Queen Victoria Club the
other afternoon surged round the question
of raising funds for the ragged Polish hat.
Miss Czaykowska, a native of the dis-
tressful patch, succeeded first in interesting
the George Earp family. The big gather-
ing, which bristled with Personages, was
the result. Chief Justice Cullen took the
chair, and promptly snuffed out any irre-
velant side-issues. Even the Baroness de
Miklouho Macleay—a daughter of old poli-
tician Jock Robertson —had to curl up
under the brim of a shady hat when the
C,J. clipped her remarks in twain. Pre-
mier Holman gave some first-rate reasons
for helping a country which has hardly ever
raised its head without having it hit by
some tyrant. Archbishop Wright bestowed
his best regards on the cause; then with-
drew with an inadvertent tango step to
avoid treading on a plethora of feminine
feet. Tom Hughes, M.L.C., wafted a sigh
of sympathy and a fat cheque at the collec-
tion plate. Neville Mayman stood forward
suddenly as if to forbid the banns or some-
thing, but it was merely to thrust 10
guineas into the fund. The ayes had it,
and the meeting adjourned, greatly exhil-
arated at finding still another patriotic pot to
be kept on the boil.
The Police and Firemen’s patriotic rally
brought in a profit of over £2OOO. This is
about to be distributed according to a well-
thought-out schedule. None of our friends
will be forgotten. A very proud fireman
handed in £l5O to the Polish Relief Fund
the other day. That was their titbit.
John Lemmone bolted off to Melbourne
last week to help Melba with the details of
the approaching Belgian Relief Concert. I
decline to say how near the approach is,
because the date lias been altered twice
already.
The Charles Gregory Wade pair have been
keeping up their silver-wedding day. It is
2;> years ago since the Opposition leader
placed a plain gold band on the finger of
Miss Ella Bell, of Sydney. To hallmark the
circlet Liberal members gave a party at the
Australia, and handed the Wades a solid
asset in the way of silver plate. Chief-
hatter David Storey, M.L.A., was president
at this postcript to the honeymoon.
Incidentally, Dr. Wade, one of the heroes
of the Kembla Colliery disaster, whose iden-
tity had a habit of getting mixed up with
that of the Opnosition leader at election
times, died last week. Dr. Wade spent a good
many years in Sydney Hospital, but, feeling
himself grow old, went down to the South
Coast to find peace among the cows.
The Bertie Lindsey pair have been cele-
brating their silver wedding, with splendor
muffled in consequence of the uproar in
France. Time rolls on with such a fierce
disregard for anyone’s feelings that it’s a
sort of prehistoric memory now that an
A.D.C. named Monty Peregrine (etc.)
Bertie was once on some sub-regal staff here.
He married a daughter of the late Dr.
James Cox. and later moulted the Bertie
and fluttered into the peerage as Earl Lind-
sey.
Captain Rome, the fair polo giant who
was on the Denman staff, has been men-
tioned in despatches from the long, long
Front. The most-worried part of the turn-
out would probably be Rome’s gee-gee. The
very large A.D.C., mounted even on an out-
size in polo ponies, used to incite the small
boy at Kensington to such derisive yells as
Git orf an’ carry ’im ’ome!”
Miss Alison Richmond, who used to live
here, is. engaged to a Captain Youyg, of
the Inniskilling Fusiliers. Alison and her
parents are now more or less settled in
Perthshire.
Justice Higgins and his pleasant-looking
missus have had a war-abbreviated tour in
Europe. They put in some time doin«- pic-
ture galleries in Italy and dodging beggars
in Madrid and elsewhere, and by now are
on their way back home.
Governor Strickland will have handed out
V'.t l i n ?, es to the e Nightingales at Prince
Alfred Hospital before you wake on Thurs-
day- This year the Nightingales deserve
something extra. The number of seniors has
been sadly cut into by the war, and aval-
anches of hard work have fallen upon those
who have been left behind—generally not
the strongest. To add to Nurse’s afflictions,
so manj 7 of the front-rank surgeons have
gone to the Front that the work in the
operating theatres takes hours and hours
longer than it used to. Nor is the drain of
muses finished yet. Last week another
dozen left —for parts unknown even to them-
selves. Among them was “Pat” O’Connell,
the popular sister who never forgave Wil-
helm for spoiling the ball which she orga-
rnue<^-rJ ear in aid of the Nurses’ Home.
J he European nightmare started just about
a week before the date fixed for her great
event.
There is a rush of hospital gatherings as a
pieliminary drum-beat to the highway rob*
bery in May. The Women’s Ilosnital (Crown-
street) committee is throwing open its
wards to visitors on April 1!). This will be
a sideline to its official gathering on the
same day. I hope the nurses’ quarters will
be thrown open too. This hospital had a
big. windfall from matinees and public sub-
scription a year or two ago. The money
was to be spent on housing the staff. It is
therefore -up to the authorities to explain
why the. nurses’ sleeping accommodation
still consists of disgraceful kennels. And
they can make the explanation all the more
freely because, I believe, the heavy fault
does not lie on themselves.
Hr. Keith Smith, weds Ivy Holcombe on
April 14. ihe affair will be a double event,
as Hay Holcombe says “I will” to Anthony
Keller within the same hour. The Hoi-
combes are station folks somewhere at the
back of Wee Waa. Keith Smith is a brother
ot pianist Laurence Godfrey, who has flung
away about the biggest collection of pupils
iu Sydney to go to the war.
r lhe Artists’ War Fund closes with a
satisfactory snap at an early date. Only
20 tickets at two guineas apiece were avail-
able a few days ago, and the person who
doesn t rush them will be left lamenting.
About £BOO is likely to be bagged as the
result of the rally.
Louise Mach’s latest photo shows her to
be much the Louise who was so often (like
her successors) behindhand with her
H oman’s Letter. Even the straight, fluffy
fringe is in its old place. She grittily
stayed in Brussels (which she crept into,
by the way, without a passport) for three
days after the enemy was in possession.
I inally she was bowled out as “English”
by a German who watched her cleaning
glasses behind a bar in Belgian costume.
Her subsequent escape is good stuff, which
we’re likely to hear when Louise lectures
presently on Australian platforms.
. Mrs. Clunies Ross, a very sad-faced lady
since her husband’s death, is lending her
younger son to our side in the Big Fight,
lie is in camp with an infantry lot, and will
kiss mother good-bye before long. Of her
sister, Mrs. Madge Donohoe, the former
Ashfield dame says she heard recently. She
is in Paris again, and by way of distracting
her. mind has been working with an ener-
getic Englishwoman, a. Miss Williams. The
two are giving all their time to one of the
minor agencies of the moment. It is a
bureau for bringing lost and mislaid rela-
tives together, and is in quite a big way of
business. War correspondent Martin
Donohoe is bobbing about the most infuri-
ated portions of the map. When last heard
of he was in Constantinople.
Mrs. Harry Maddrell, of Braidwood,
came to town for the recent wet weather
and other Easter festivities. She brought
daughter Bery], and son Garnet also came
to see the Show nicely rained upon. The
rest of the progeny, who were all laden at
the baptismal font with the names of more
or less precious stones, were not amongst
those present, I think.
The Gilbert Lodge couple are back in
Sydney, after a whirling jaunt on the other
side. Mrs. Gilbert has been airing some
elegant rags as her contribution to the
recent dress parade at Randwic-k. The
special object of her friends’ regard just
now is the car that was her excess luggage
on the voyage out. It has a pale, mouse-colored
inside, and mother-o’-pearl fittings, and you
press a button to throw a light on the step
o’ dark nights. As the owner is given to
motoring her acquaintances about, they’re
bearing up well under the circumstances.
Mrs. Staee, who won the Cinderella jump,
6ft. 6in. high, at the Show, talks of sitting
back and seeing the other girls get over the
hurdles. She has been a professional rider
for about 39 years, with so few falls that
the number must be almost nil. As a
youngster she got her firm seat in the side-
saddle—to which she still clings like a
limpet—in the rough scrub country round
Walcha.
The elegance of pale-green hair is forcibly
illustrated in “(Cinderella,” which has a
r uturist procession to round off the second
act. Turquoise locks are also a stunning
environment for the blue-eyed chorus ladies.
But the Egyptian ballet, with corkscrew
curls the color of a green apple, are the very
thing the hair-doctor ought to order for the
coming winter. The dressing right through
the panto at Her Majesty’s is alluring. Most
of the ballet belles may be mentioned here
as far better covered than some of the audi-
ence the other night. On a quick survey one
Juno in a box appeared to have nothing on
from the waist upwards; but getting into
details one saw a drape of transparent gauze
mercifully holding her together. Dolly
Castles gets into a gorgeous white shimmer,
that sparkles like hoar frost, for the Prince’s
ball. She is a pretty little Dresden-china
doll, with a “Kiss me now and go, honey,”
expression, which was squandered on the
Principal Boy, who is, of course, a girl,
appropriately called Minnie Love.
St. Vincent’s Hospital concert is going
to put a cosy cheque into that fine institu-
tion’s worried treasury. The committee,
which itself spread over much floor space,
could see but few empty seats, and most of
them were booked and paid for.
A long sub-regal tail swept into the Town
Hall as organist Truman played the
National Anthem. Excellency Helen looks
her best in evening finery, for she bares a
graceful head bound with a diamond circlet,
and a nest of soft, dark curls on top. The
party settled itself in roomy easy chairs,
with Aide Eane in the offing. Mrs. Harry
Finn and the General (the latter in his
mess rags, which are the color of a boiled
lobster in their upper reaches) ; the W. A.
Holmans, the Premier a very weary man
after the P.L.L. dust-storm; Mrs. John
Toohey in majestic raven.drapery, and Miss
Egan—these were also to the front. Rus-
sian Consul Welch, a kind of official odd-
man-out at these shows, lurked near bv.
Mrs. Herbert Kendall, one of the lion,
treasurers; Mrs. John Hughes, Mrs.
George Lane Mullins, Mrs. O’Gorman
Hughes and Mrs. W. J. Chandler were very 7
pleased committee dames. Chief Justice
Cullen’s white thatch and the meek coiffure
of his lady were caged in some splendor on
the sub-regal carpet, and so was the affable
Mayor Richards. The John Lane Mullins
family in all its war-paint was entrenched
in the. body of the hall. Solicitor Norris,
with sister Etta tucked under his arm, was
close up.
The audience was so much like a big social
resurrection that one scanned the usual
faces—from Mrs. Baronet Cooper, on the
floor, to Mrs. Maiden, with two pretty daugh-
ters, in a gallery—and wondered if it were
a kind of Last Day musical party 7. Mr.
Clarence Bridge sold and resold by auction
a doll hospital, and thus added about £5O
to the funds. The programme was much
like every other charity concert programme.
Performers accepted encores without provo-
cation, and Aide Fane, who had to attend
the Fergusons home to Yaralla, finally made
a dash to get the chaise wound up for action.
Then the whole party hurried off so fast that
it turned its back on the second instalment
of “God Save,” and sped into the night.
The Alfred Turnbulls are booked for the
long, wet journey to London. The sporting
Alfred is prepared to offer his services to
the Allies, and I fancy he’ll do it on English
soil. The rather foolish statement that
just-come-back Dr. Thring believed the war
would be soon over is putting an edge on the
Australian’s desire to be there in time. The
fact that “high military authorities” don’t
usually loan important war news to a wan-
dering surgeon is even less to the point than
the cold argument that not even “high mili-
tary authorities” know much more than other
people. If they did there wouldn’t be much
fighting.
Another Australian who has developed a
punch since the war broke all previous
records is Arthur David, formerly chairman
of the Ballarat Stock Exchange. He went
off as sergeant with the first Australian
Expedition and draws 11 shillings a day and
rations. Another David, this one from Syd-
ney, has also gone forth, but not to slay
Goliath. He is in the healing line, and is
with an army medical corps. David, jun., is a
son of the Sydney ’Varsity professor who can
tell you the age of any old boulder.
A queer, varied outlook seems to fill the
mental eye of Dr. Chappie, now M.P. for
Stirling in the House of Commons. The son
of an Otago (M.L.) farmer, he made a pile
in shrewd speculation before going to live in
England. His literary output usually relates
to allopathy and the right way to get a
competence on the soil. His latest screed, in
an English paper, is on “The Utility of
Goat-keeping for Working People”!
To help the Belgian babies youngsters will
stampede through the Norland College
garden on April 17. Manager Elswick, of
the White City, is the lion, commanding
officer of the pageant which will trail the
silken robes of history round the flower
beds.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, April 12. 1015.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Rose Night—which followed Rose Day
was a desolate time in Melbourne. Dead
rose petals littered the streets, and all sorts
of rubbish blew about the sites of popular
stands. The outside walls of the grey old
Town flail were banked up with the broken
and discarded cardboard boxes in which the
vanished “workers” had carried the reserve
supplies of blooms. It was all so character-
istic of the average Bloekhaunter’s habit of
leaving the tidying-up to Mjary Ann or good
old Mother. After the man-crowded hours
of six and seven, and after the rose damsels
had fed at other people’s expense, hundreds
of the pets were to be seen limping off
suburban stations. They had all worn high-
heeled, buckled shoes' that were pretty but
not pavement-proof, and their faces were
screwed with the agony born of tight patent
leather.
After the tea interval a. fresh ■ contingent,
which had stayed in kimonos until afternoon
tea-time, set out and “did” the theatres and
supper cafes. So many of the volunteers
were plain of face that I’m sure, they must
have beautiful souls.
As a prelude to the Rose Day fuss, every
smart hotel and cafe was crowded with
merry luncheon parties. At Menzies’ the
Baillieux entertained Melba and the Russian
('onsul. At the Grand the Allen dame had
bagged the Belgian representative and the
Gaud Mayoral couple, whilst Bigjohn For-
rest’s wife ran a rival spree. Admiral Cres-
wcll was at the Mia Mia, and the “High
.links” people were all over the city. For
the motor parade, State Governor Stanley
and his lady (the latter with roses in her
hat) had a perch in the Allen kiosk at the
Town Ilall. Melba later had a tea party
at the Oriental. The Allen dame and the
widow Stapghton marshalled armies of girls
like experienced generals. Mrs. Ambrose
l’ratt commanded a squad of Hower-sellers
who picketed Menzies’. Mrs. Robins took
her bunch to the bookmakers’ club. “But
there was money in it!” she quavered, when
a listener threw up her hands in distress.
Willie Watt and Herbert Brookes kept
Scott’s from feeling out of it. The free food
and drink consumed in the course of the
campaign rojind town would have filled many
Belgians.
Some time during Easter the Arts and
Crafts auctioned their gifts. This dreadful
similarity of functions is gradually getting
on my nerves. Why can’t someone give a
Libel Tea for the poor Belgians? Every
gift was “up to standard” (in A. and C.
parlance), and of real value—unusual
enough to be worth noting. One enterpris-
ing girl—Miss Purchas, a Melba relative—
had made toys, and is trying to capture a
slice of the German trade. Her kangaroos,
native bear and magpies were very cunning.
Miss Dunn presented a charcoal drawing of
an old mill at Dixmude; needless to say she
sketched it before the war. The Stanley
Cady carried that prize off. Violet
Teague’s book about ti-tree, with
original woodcuts, dragged in a good sum.
while a W ilson sketch of Genee, all gold
whirl against blue, excited several buvers.
One of the Austins, of Toorak. sent in a
handwoven shawl of ancient design. It
was nearly clawed by avaricious hands dur-
ing the sale. People had to pay sixpence to
have a preparatory look round, and secre-
tary Miss McGeorge saw to it that the
exhibits got a fair deal. After the auction
(it was held in Commerce House, where the
commercial travellers had lent a room),
buyers wandered down Flinders-street to
the train, each with her bit of booty
carried without wrapping of any sort under
her arm. If any woman had broken into
a run she would probably have- been
arrested. Anv policeman knows that
unwrapped goods are stolen goods..
Robert Parker gave his last life-arranged
concert on Thursday night. The two yet
to come are extras—by special request. The
singer’s Wagnerian efforts brought forth
bursts of applause that shook the Town
Hall to the basement and woke up the
restaurant rats in the next street. Melba,
all in pale blue spangles, came and sat at
his melodious feet. She has managed to put
in at least half an hour at each concert.
Parker sang “Still as the Night” at the
special request of Nellie, who sings that
song quite nicely herself, you know. Car-
men Harris, of course, does not depend
wholly on lief voice; her entertaining
clothes alone would earn her a welcome on
any platform. On Thursday she looked like
a very solid Christmas-party fairy. Her
frock was made of frills and frills and more
frills of rose-pink tulle, and there was a
partly submerged rose-pink sash as well as
10 pink roses marshalled in line across her
capacious chest. She wore a diamond (or
something i circlet on her hair, and—just
listen to this! —she had white tulle trousers
frilled in at the ankle under her rose-pink
dress and over her rose-pink shoes! I ask
you what is the good of mentioning a mere
voice after all that?
Three musicians in the audience who
ought to know better (they perform on the
platform themselves at times) kept up a
barbaric racket. The group consisted of a
girl and two men. I have an idea that the
girl knew she was showing too much
shoulder and had to keep talking to divert
attention. Another pest and a worse one
was the enthusiast who brought an enormous
score and turned the pages with loud whirs
and cracklings during soft passages. What
does a Sensible person want to audit a con-
cert for, anyhow? And while I am on the
subject of Town Hall concert nuisances, let
me make threatening noises about the creaky
boots of the ushers. If the management
cannot censor the boots consumed by ushers
it ought to make them walk on their hands.
_ Lesly Madden, secretary of the proposed
Carnival, called a meeting at the Town Hall
last week, and was rewarded with a small,
tired group of women. The Mayoress was
with her husband at another meeting, which
was discussing ways and means of helping
our drought-stricken country people, so she
couldn’t spare the time to visit the less vital
show. Anyhow Lesly, from under the sort
of fashionable Belgian toque that no Belgian
is now wearing, read out acceptances from
the Fergusons, and a regret from the Stanley
pair and Melba. Miss Armytage was present
under a load of huge black feathers. Mrs.
Davidson, less funereal, in dove color, hovered
watchfully at the secretary’s elbow. Mrs.
Donald McKinnon sat and knitted furiously,
shaking her head emphatically at tentative
suggestions of “stalls.” “I’ll pay my part,”
she jerked out, while the needles played like
summer lightning, adding kindly: “I can’t
tackle any more work.” Mrs. Robins, who
has been told she looks adorable dressed as
a Japanese, insinuated a Japanese stall and
was immediately crushed. The widow
Staughton, in a seat of honor, and with a
Belgian flag worn like a bib under her chin,
gave a terrible lot of good advice, and Irma
Caron offered to auction, in recitative, a few
odds and ends left over from Frances Frazer’s
jumble sale. But I guess the offer of the
Salon at half the usual rates will be a big
lure. If people can dance and feel that they
are thereby helping the poor Belgians out of
their misery, sweet charity comes easy. I
really don’t know. wliat a lot of people will
do when the Belgian is on his feet again.
Melbourne Bohemia (what there is of it)
dined at its old haunt, Fasoli’s, the other
night and hie—d on behalf of the Belgians.
Wine and song flowed freely, and so did the
cash when fermented and spirituous liquors,
scent, sweets and jewellery were put up for
sale.
Councillor Scot Sharpe, of Berwick, who
is as good a judge of horseflesh as any man
in the country, has offered a fine three-year-
old for raffle or auction in aid of the Bel-
gians. IT-m, yes! But if it wasn’t for the
poor Belgians I would rather take a ticket
in a horse donated by someone who wasn’t
a good judge of horseflesh.
They’re all doing it! Willie Watt has
turned amateur auctioneer, and will sell
goods in aid of the Belgians, at the Winter
Gardens, in the Block, on Monday evening.
April 19. Miss Si'egenberg is presenting
refreshments, and there will be card parties
and quite exceptional music.
Don’t forget, my dear, that Niblo
Beautiful is to auction the Repertory Theatre
spoils for the poor Belgians, in the upper
room of the Athenaeum, on Friday. 16th. Yiou
have an appointment with me at the door.
Speak to your tram conductor and he will
eject you almost at the entrance.
An Anglo-Indian officer, in sending his
latest portrait to a Melbourne girl, begs her
not to mind the weatherbeaten look of his
uniform. “Starch is not the thing now.” he
says, in his apologetic' English way. “just
field-service kit and any old thing at that.”
Tn other words, grime and frayed edges are
fashionable.
Ilossen I .off, tin l Swiss who. until he left
for Europe a year ago, was the autocrat of
the Savoy supper-table, tried unsuccessfully
to enlist with the French army shortly after
the war started, but has now been given a
job in the commissariat department. Loff’s
tall, golden-liaired spouse has a flat in West
Kensington, alleged to be bomb-proof, but
she is not yearning to put it to the test.
From “Rosna” in London :
The infant A.N.A., lately born in London, and
dandled on the knee of H. Kneebore, of the Common-
wealth Office, lias just handed a life metnbership to
Miss Lonsdale, who believes she was the first white
woman born in Melbourne. Her father, Captain Lons-
dale, was in charge of the 4th King’s Own Regiment
stationed in Melbourne before the city was built.
She now lives in Cheltenham.
The latest knitting triumph produced on this side
is a scarf or comforter which becomes a chess-board
when Mr. Atkins no longer needs it round his reck.
We are now busy devising mittens that become box-
ing-gloves, a helmet that turns itself into an incen-
diary bomb when hurled at the Kaiser, and a cholera
belt that dissolves into champagne and turkey when
rations give out.
Loyal? I should tliink we were!
Governor Stanley, attended by secretary
Hodges and a bevy of Ministers, recently
concluded a picnic trip in the north-east of
Victoria, finishing up with a few days at
the Buifalo Mountains. At one place—it
isn’t far from Bright—all the cattle in the
district, which is suffering severely from
the drought, were driven away, so that his
Ex. should not be distressed by the sight of
emaciated beasts. _ Then with easy hearts
the townsfolk awaited his arrival, and sang
“Gorsave” as bis car stopped at the pub.
Waxcellency John Madden, just returned
from England, says that the war has almost
abolished the dogginess of the aristocracy.
The society woman has set aside her poodle
for the time being, and toy terriers are 2d.
a bundle. The big men of the war are now
engrossing the ladies’ attention. They’ve
abandoned poodles for lions.
Valerie Hayter is to marrv Dr. 11. Ilid-
dell Stanley on April IT. The bride-elect
is the grand-daughter of departed 11. 11.
Hayter, who was Government Statist in
earlier Victorian days, and who caught a
L.M.G.-ship, probably because he was a
cousin of Lord Hdfversham. if you please
The wedding party will toast: and confetti
at the Hayter home in East St. Kilda.
Mrs. Gordon Lane, once Ivatli. Mcllwraith,
daughter of a cricketer of ancient fame, and
one of Melbourne’s best-lookimr products, has
settled down with her youthful spouse at
Latong estate, near Benalla. Hubby is the
son of old man Lane, who scratched an in-
credible quantity of gold out of Westralia or
somewhere.
The George Chirnside matron and
daughter Audrey found so little entertain-
ment in London that they packed up after
a short stay mid got out, taking a sporting
Channel risk of submarines and drifting
mines. Some people will chance a lot to get
away from gloom.
Geoffrey Officer, who lately wrestled with
pneumonia, is returning this week to- wind v
Broadmeadows after a convalescentVspelL at
Ins mother’s place. It seems a pity lie’s ,a
mere private instead of a general, because
his brothers run an ostrich farm and could
cover liis hat with first-class plumes free of
charge.
Three sisters who had intended going to
London to do washing up or something for
the poor Belgians have had an inspiration.
They now think that, instead of flying per-
sonally. it would be more helpful* to send
along their passage money and stay where
they are. I applaud their decision with my
brolly._ Anybody who has ever witnessed
the painful spectacle of a rich amateur wash-
ing up will readily agree that it is a sight
that, should be spared the war-worn * find
desperate.
Young Ashby Hooper, son of Golds-’ 1 '
brougli s manager, has found a place amongst
the guns of the Royal Field Artillery. The
boy (he only farewelled his schooldays last
December) went to London early in the
year and managed a visit to his aunt. Mrs.
Wesley Hall, before getting on the job.
From Adelaide, now wet and cheerful—
Clara Serena Kleinschmidt, Iho Adelaide’girl who
was formed into a limited liability co., so that she
might study in Europe, lias definitely decided to drop
the Kleinschmidt, and become Clara Serena. She will
make her first public re-appearance in Adelaide on
May 1, in the Town Hall, but before that she will
take part in the Melba concert in the Victorian
capital. At her own concert William -Silver, Harold
Parsons and Roy Mollish will lend helping hands, and
Rumor says the voice which promised well six years
ago has done all that was expected of it.
He Giorgio, who was a big figure in the musical
world here 15 years ago, returned by the Malwa and
spent a few days in hunting up old friends. The
same boat took on with it to Europe a large consign-
mont of Adelaide passengers—Mrs. Teesdale Smith
and her daughter; Miss Joyce Waterhouse; MrW
Mouchette and Mi s. Lion ; Miss Ivyffin Thomas and
Miss Dorothy Doely. Miss Deely had planned to go
six months back, but she decided to wait till tilings
cook'd down. Her mission is to bring her dancing
up to date. She is one of our best teachers.
Oakbank on Monday was a pleasure to be taken
sadly, for the dust on the road aiuLlpii the course
was enough to smother the eiithusiaVnr of all but the
aggressively enthusiastic. The fact that half the
proceeds were earmarked for the Belgian Fund
probably inspired the attendance of a good many who
would otherwise have chosen a spot where the soil
wasn’t drifting in mid-air. As it was, the totaliza-
tor takings showed a big drop. The Governor was
there, with Miss D’Erlanger and (‘apt. Hanker and
1 'apt. Mulholland, and there were the usual drag’ and
motor parties, with lunch in the paddock. But
scinattoeraey was less in evidence than usual —it was
to> busy keeping its stock alive to worry over race-
meetings. And then glorious rain started.
Colonel Dean, who has been appointed to the com-
mand of the 13th Regiment of Light Horse, leaves
in a day or so for Victoria, where liis little lot iris
been organised. Ho has charge of the Sth Light Horse
Brigade at the moment. His wife is a daughter of
our Edwin Smith, who has just indulged in his 85ih
birthday. That makes the Chief Justice, who was
ih on Sunday, a mere child by comparison.
Tlie setting-in of rain on Flag Day was the best
thing that could have happened to the Belgian Fund,
and the day’s taking amounted to £ 2000-odd. True
to custom, the amateur peddlers wore white, which
was all right if it were serge or cloth, and all wrong
if it were muslin, which a good deal of it was. No
one,, short of a Grecian nymph, can look really
bewitching in limp muslin on a grey April day.
Auctions of flags and sales of anything from kisses
to the dummy “limb” on which drapers display their
meretricious hose, helped to add to the total of tlie
cheque. There were collecting dogs and masked
musicians and everything else that could be devised
to coax coin from hiding. Town looked as busy as
a sewing meeting, and the place fairly rioted in
black and scarlet and gold.
Opening of State Parliament, which is
lather less important than the opening of a
good winter sale, will happen with the usual
ha penny pomp and circumstance on Tues-
( a -y- | shall be there. You know what
duty will drive a woman to.
Hi. Fyfe s wife s brother’s wife is the
a test asset the Best Dressed have acquired.
She is Mrs. Osborne Smith, and her hus-
band recently brought her out from England.
A slim figure, she wears good clothes as the
Lord meant them to be worn, and even-
other woman has to acknowledge the fact.
Hail, Mrs. Smith !
The Hugh Denisons are amongst those
whose plans went astray through the Euro-
pean eruption. State cabins had been
booked months ahead, Mrs. Hugh had plans
ot some divinely simple deck frocks, and the
two young sons who were to have been in-
stalled at Oxford were all brushed and
ready Then the roof of History blew off,
ai ?(* the plans and specifications went
with it.
Plain I ted Cross fun having become a
tnfie monotonous, we are to have it served
up as _La Croix Itouge de France at the
Masonic Hall on May 12. Mrs. (Dr.)
Crevelli, who lias sons serving in France,
is organising, and the John Maddens are
benevolently interested. The Mayoress lias
also been engaged, and artists of local fame
will provide music.
The new Scotch College buildings have
begun to sprout on the top of Clenferrie
Hill, where they will get all the breezes
that blow. An old gabled Gothic palace of
a place is being pulled down to make room
lor_ the up-to-date classrooms and dormi-
tories. Glen, the founder of the Collins-
street music firm, built the house. Lately it
tell into the hands of (lie Baillieux. and
now “Scotch” is poured into it. Mothers
of prospective pupils are doubtfully eyeing
the cliff cut in the side of the hill—an arti-
ficial precipice which drops sheer from the
garden to the tram track below. Hut a
tremendous boy-proof fence is promised to
keep. fond mothers from seeing mangled
remains when day-dreaming fondly at home.
Yours sincerely.

How to Have a Clear
Complexion.
It is quite easy even in a hot climate like
Australia to prevent the wrinkling, drying
and blotching effect of the dust and heat, but
it is absolutely necessary to use a pure soap
without any added coloring matter or excess
of soda. Puritol Wax Soap is such
a soap, with just a little fine per-
fume added, and some Puritol. wax,
which has such a reputation for keeping the
skin soft and for removing pimples and
blotches. A very fine film of the wax is left
on the skin after using this soap, which
effectually protects the skin from heat and
dust. Its healing effect is well known on
blotchy skins, and undoubtedly many of the
fine complexions are due to the use of Puritol
Wax Soap.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
The yawnful Toombs defends the Norton
Griffiths calamity with the reflection that,
as Governments have neglected to build up
Protection, and as finance has been allowed
to go to Gehenna, there is nothing for him,
as a good Labor member, to do now but
support Holman in “attracting capital to
the country.” Of course everybody knows
that the surest way for a man to get out of
a tight financial corner is to play up his
cash at the races and then, having “done it
all in,” to sell his boots and have a flutter
in the two-up school.
THE FOOTPADS.
AUSTRALIA: "If I only had effective Protec-
tion I could deal with the lot.”
South Aus. has settled down to breath-
less quiet after the referendum which more
or less decided by an immense majority that
all its liquor-bars shall close at six p.m.
Nobody expected a result so overwhelming.
The Anglican Bishop of Adelaide declared
definitely for nine o’clock, and most people
thought’that the moderates would turn the
scale as between the early-closers and the
eleveners. But you can never tell how the
cat will jump, and it was the cat who did
this. One cynic says that every .bar orator
in Adelaide was beating his wife on the
day after the election.
When a deputation of the importing
species waited on a Minister the other day
and explained that a scent industry was
impossible in Australia because there were
not sufficient flowers, someone should have
rung up for the Comptroller of Fools. There
is some shred of excuse for being chary of
starting industries which require skilled
craftmanship as well as great quantities oi :
expensive plant; but it is an insult to imply
that the people of this country are incapable
of raising the raw material which requires
only a little attention with a watering-pot.
Next time the importing shoddy merchant
asks the Minister to reduce the duties on
his wares he might go on the same lines and
mention that Australia can’t grow the neces-
sary wool, it being utterly beyond our capa-
city to sit on a fence and watch the ferocious
sheep feed.
THE RAT IN THE LABOR PARTY'S
CUPBOARD.
“De Yid”: Naturally Bung in S. Aus. is
feeling hurt. His best friends have
turned German on him. At the referendum
the other day the Port Adelaide wharf-
lumpers formed themselves into a proces-
sion and marched to the polling-booth with
the publicly-avowed intention of voting six
o’clock. Judging by the figures, there could
have been few who renegged. At Port
l'irie the same thing occurred, and the
strong Builders’ Laborers’ Union also gave
its moral support to the wowser.
Naturally the chaplains feel sore about
having their screws cut down from something
like £9OO to £475 —the wages of a mere cap-
tain. There was weeping and lamentation
in Egypt when the holy men heard what the
Defence Department had done, and a gentle
moan of protest was posted home. The
shepherds pointed out that, though “they
had no intention of allowing pecuniary con-
siderations to come between them and their
work,” they had made their arrangements
on the higher scale, and would like the dread-
ful step to be reconsidered. Meanwhile “they
did not desire to avail themselves of the
offer of a return passage to Australia by the
first available steamer.” Summed-up, their
attitude seems to be: “You promised us
these absurdly lavish wages, and we are
only here because of our high sense of duty.
But if you.try to take from us half of our
wages (which, of course, don’t weigh with
us at all) we will say, in the most respectful
way, that you are robbing the Church.”
Pearce must by now be wondering whether
it is really part of he State’s job to pay
chaplains to its soldiers any more than to
its navvies. Is it?
Of the new Labor Ministry, in South Aus.
Crawford Vaughan, the Premier, is the only
one who was in the Verran team. Verran
himself is dropped, with Coneybeer (who,
however, is to get the Speakership). Denny
(the former Attorney-General), Wallis and
Wilson. Verran is likely to be chairman of
the Railways Standing Committee, but
nothing is said about Denny. In age, the
Ministry ranges merely from 43 (Blundell)
to 36 (J. H. Vaughan), and all but the
Premier are new to office. Offices are at
present arranged this way: C. Vaughan,
Premier, Treasury and Education; Styles,
Chief Secretary; Goode, Crown Lands and
Agriculture; Jackson (former Speaker),
Public Works; Blundell, Marine, Industry
and Mines; J. H. Vaughan, Attorney-
General; Anstey, Whip. It is the first time
this century that the Attorney-General has
been in the Leg. Council: the last instance
was J. 11. Gordon (now Judge) in a Holder
Ministry.
Germany’s cheap goods have been broomed
off the seas; but there are others. Last
week one of the biggest visitors from Japan
rolled through Sydney Heads with tens of
thousands of empty bottles under hatches.
What Japan thinks of a poor, benighted coun-
try which doesn’t even make its own bottles
hasn’t been told. It might do Australia good
if it was told.
Defence Minister Pearce, after the
announcement had been made that a further
contingent had been offered to Britain, had
to admit another humiliation caused by the
Freetrade insanity. It was almost certain,
he said, that it would be necessary to im-
port some parts of the new equipment; the
demand of the moment being beyond the
capacity of the woollen mills to satisfy.
There, is irony in the situation. Australia
supplies the world with a good portion of
the wool it . wears, and a few months ago
the. people interested in the fleece-growing
business didn’t know what to do because the
foreign buyer had momentarily suspended
operations. Yet because Australia has
never given a pr per encouragement to its
own woollen industries, the stress of a little
extra demand shows it unable to supply its
own requirements in the manufactured
article.
Mr. Bung is right in the limelight in
Westralia at present. His influence on the
community is being roared about and
thumped at on platforms and in pulpits, and
statistics are produced to prove that nearly
three times more people are charged with
drunkenness in Perth to-day than was the
case 10 years ago. Last year 2372 toed the
mark, and —this is wfliere you begin to see
the milk in the cocoanut —unless the hours
of trading are shortened the number of
offenders for 1915 is tipped to astound the
community. The general agitation against
der-rink led the mine-workers at Gwalia to
look into the price of beer the other day,
and, having done so, they decided that the
tariff was too high. A strike was declared,
the State pub was picketed, and a communi-
cation setting forth the strikers’ demands
was sent to Attorney-General Walker.
Walker has long since turned his back on
liquor, and was so pleased with the infor-
mation that he immediately replied congratu-
lating the strikers on having sworn off, said
something about State hotels not being built
to encourage drinking, and expressed a hope
that the strike would last until Doomsday.
He further emphasised the delight he felt
by adding that if it was desired to mark the
occasion in a more definite way, he would
send up a parcel of temperance pledges. Now
he wonders why he isn’t popular at Gwalia.
THE VOID.
It is the intention of the Federal Ministry to bring
on the Customs Tariff almost as soon as the session
starts. —News item.
THE NURSE: “ ’E’s sticking air — wot’e wants
is sustenance."
Carlyle's beforehand picture of Holman : —-
Let no man say he had not genius; genius for
persuading', and, before all things, for borrowing.
But payment by loan is no way to choke a deficit.
That trade is by nature temporary, growing daily
more difficult.
And so the French Revolution, of which
Carlyle was writing, moved on.
Premier Peacock (Vic.) says he thinks
“finance will be the main theme of discus-
sion” at the State Premiers’ Conference
nex-t month. Well, as Australia’s public
debt is now over £323,000,000, it looks as if
there were questions in connection with the
matter worth talking about for a few
minutes.
THE PRODIGAL SON; OR A BAD
LOOK-OUT FOR THE CALF.
The State Labor Conference at Sydney decided
not to censure the Government in connection with
the Norton Griffiths scheme. —News item.
The Vic. butter-selling agents, to whom
the Food Prices Board had just previously
refused permission to increase the price,
casually notified that, Board or no Board,
they intended to raise the figure by Id. per
lb. from April 1, and did so. The Board
smiled in a sickly sort of way, and replied
that it would take further evidence and
might then review its decision. Seeing
that it has no power to enforce its rulings,
the Plank is a joke; but there is no visible
reason why it should collect fees, etc., for
being a mere redundant pimple, so to speak.
Two of its members already receive fair
allowances of public money, and the others
can hardly plead unemployment as an excuse
for accepting charity.
The S. M. Herald (30/3/T5), after look-
ing on Dryberra : —•
The Federal capital site has been thoroughly tried
this year. The district is passing through one of
the worst droughts ever experienced, and the absence
of rain has converted Canberra into a barren-look-
ing area, which, seen for the first time, would cause
the visitor to entertain very grave doubts regarding
its suitability for a site for the first city of the
Commonwealth. Fortunately, however, seasons of
such severity are of very rare occurrence, as is proved
by the fact that this year watercourses have gone
dry for the first time within living memory.
The yarn about this being “the first time
within living memory” that watercourses
have gone dry may be cut out. The memory
of the Oldest Inhabitant about the local
watercourse is too uncertain a thing to hang
a weighty statement on. What we can be
quite sure of is that, in the very first year
after the gilt-spurred rooster laid a founda-
tion-stone on the spot, Canberra became "a
barren-looking area,” wrinkled with dry
watercourses. And still the insanity of fixing
a continent’s capital there goes on.
The Norton Griffiths arrangement made
by the N.S.W, Traitor Government intro-
duces quite a new system of payment by
results —the worse the results the better the
payment. The idea is capable of indefinite
application. The object being to give em-
ployment, the next Government, if it is mad
enough, will tell the present Judges to stand
aside on full pay, while some other people
get on the Bench. The greater the number
of appeals the more the new Judges will
earn. The railways constructed by the Nor-
ton Griffiths syndicate, may be run on the
same lines: the Commissioners .will be paid
according to the number of trains and pas-
sengers they can smash and the revenue they
don’t earn. The police, having been organ-
ised —just the same as the Public Works
Department has been organised to carry out
public works —will be told to go fishing,
while a syndicate is employed to do their
job—the more crime the syndicate doesn t
prevent the bigger its remuneration. It
won’t, however, be necessary to make am
change so far as Parliament is concerned.
There the fact that the party in power hasn.t
done the things it was pledged to do is
already regarded as sufficient reason why it
should go on drawing pay for continuing to
not do them.
WHAT WILLIE WANTED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I never wanted this awful war. —The Kaiser,
This carnage grim, this awful war,
These wicked Allies brought it;
I never wanted Teuton gore—
No, no 1 I never sought it.
The war I clearly had in view
Meant death and hurt to Frenchmen,
A Belgium shattered through and through
By my victorious henchmen;
My Eagle over proud Paree,
Tile prize of Teuton tussles,
My banners floating fair and free
O’er London sacked and Brussels.
I merely planned to crush the Gaul,
By dint of mighty dashes;
I never worked for Prussia’s fall
In smoke and blood and ashes.
This mad rapine I did but mean
For Belgian homes and wenches;
While Deutschland stayed intact and clean
Unscarred by bloody trenches.
I ne’er intended dear Berlin
Should suffer any ravage;
Such things were meant for Russ and Finn
And Pole and Balkan savage.
No wish had I that fire and flame
Should waste a Prussian village,
Or Fatherland (that holy name!)
Should feel the pangs of pillage.
Such things in our headquarters’ scheme
Were planned for Flemish lowland,
For Servian plain and Gallic stream
And Slavish folk in Poland.
So Death behind and Death before
On German field and highway,
Must not be laid at William’s door—
’Twas never meant as my way.

DOES THE SYSTEM ABSORB
MINERAL PROPERTIES FROM OIL
TAKEN AS AN INTERNAL LUBRI-
CANT ?
There is an exceedingly important feature
in connection with the taking of mineral oil
in the system which many have never given
a thought to, and undesirable results are
certain to follow if this practice is con-
tiuued. Is there any doubt that the cells
of the stomach through which we draw the
elements of nutrition also draw and absorb
into the system this mineral oil? There is
no doubt of this at all r and also the walls
of the intestines, which are covered with
the lubricant, absorb this oil as w 7 ell. The
entire internal system is, therefore, absorbing
mineral properties foreign to the human
system—properties that cannot help, sus-
tain or nourish the body. Is there any
medical authority who values his reputation
that will say this is a wise or safe course to
continue?
The public who have been using an inter-
nal lubricant, in the shape of some form of
mineral oil of petroleum jelly, to relieve
constipation, are finding out that this whole-
sale lubrication of their internal organs is
destroying one of Nature’s most vital fluids
—the bile. Nature finds its work being
done by a foreign agent, grows less and less
active,; and at last ceases to put forth any
effort. Just as a strong arm put in a sling,
and given no exercise, becomes weak and
useless, so the continual lubrication of the
internal organs by mineral oils will surely
weaken and reduce the flow of bile. It
destroys the natural movement of the bowels,
because it supersedes the flow of the bile,
and, therefore, the taking of liquid paraf-
fine in any of its forms is a source of future
danger to anyone so foolish as to be carried
away by what is nothing but a most unfor-
tunate fad.
To put it as clearly as possible, the liver
can be compared to a big sponge full of
holes. It becomes covered over with a slimy
substance, and these holes or ducts, from
which the bile flows, become stopped up, con-
sequently the bile is forced back into the
system, producing two direct results: (a) a
derangement of the entire system; and (b)
constipation, because the bile cannot act on
the waste matter in the intestinal canal, and
it remains in the system. This is what is
commonly known as torpid liver. Some-
thing is wanted to get at the cause —some-
thing that will act on the liver and open
up fihese ducts. Not something that will
simply carry off the waste in the system,
leaving it in just the same state to repeat
over again just what has taken place. No
poisonous mineral product will take the
place of the bile given each human being by
an all-wise Creator to carry the waste mat-
ter out of the system, and aid in the diges-
tion and assimilation of our food. People
resorting to this mineral oil —either in igno-
rance or not, and practically saying: “We
have no further use for the bile; we have
something to relieve constipation, that is all
we care” —will pay for their ignorance or im-
pudence in thinking they can improve on the
Creator’s work.
Sometimes Nature only requires a little
assistance to get over an obftf.ruction, and
if something is used to merely give that
assistance, and not usurp all Nature’s func-
tions, and take the entire operation out of
Nature’s hands, then valuable help is being
rendered. This is where the invaluable pro-
perties of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are
apparent. They do not usurp Nature’s
functions, destroying all their natural activ-
ity; but when Nature needs help to carry its
often too heavy burden, caused by over-
eating and drinking then Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills assist Nature. They act on the
stomach, and. above all, on the liver, causing
the stopped-up ducts to release the flow
of bile that has been withheld. It is this
flow 7 of bile that causes the bow’els to act.
and any remedy that ignores this fact is
causing damage to the great human mechan-
ism. It is the constant and regular flow
of bile that aids in the digestion and, assim-
ilation of food, and when this flow ceases
from any cause the system is at once affected
throughout, and constipation, of course, the
inevitable result.
For nearly a century Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills have been in use as a remedy for
liver ailments. They get at the cause. They
open the ducts, and allow the bile to flow,
aiding and assisting Nature, not in any way
superseding or weakening the natural func-
tions. A pill occasionaly produces regu-
larity and good health, and, w'itli reasonable
care regarding overtaxing the digestive
organs with either food or drink, a. healthy
condition can be maintained. This is the
secret of good health in man, woman and
child, and there is no getting away from it.
Any fad that is based on the principle
that it can take the place of the bile is. a
fraud and a danger, and should be speedily
put where it belongs—back into the oil tank
for lubricating machinery, not into the
human system.*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
“0.K.”: I frankly admit I am sorry for
Jack Johnson. My reasons: (1) Boxing is a black
man’s game, and if the colored races had equal
opportunities for becoming proficient at it, no white
man would get into the champion class. (2) Johnson
was an object lesson in manly bearing to the white
eroucliers and blind-swipers who earn a good living
by bad work. (3) He has been maligned and per-
secuted by people who wanted to beat him somehow.
(4) He always entered the ring with the motley
crowd against him, but his contempt for the pre-
judice of the motley crowd was always good humored.
(5) He was derided on account of his color in a
country which formerly lionised Peter Jackson, who
was blacker. (6) He appealed to the sympathies of
the fair-minded, because he was railed against and
conspired against. And / am fair-minded. (7) He
offered no excuse .for his defeat, though he is said
to have got if on the jaw while turning his head to
smile at his wife. (8) He was a lot smaller and nine
years older than his opponent, who could think o£
nothing worse to call him than “a -grand old man.’’
Presumably the terms under which Jess
Willard and Jack Johnson fought at Havana were
the same as agreed upon when the match
was fixed for Juarez (Mexico). The black
thereby was to receive £5OOO and Willard £3OOO.
Share of picture rights would add to the wad. The
biggest whack Johnson ever received was £24,000
when he beat Jim Jeffries in the Reno farce. The
purse was £20,000, of which the Big’ Smoke’s share
was £12,000. Also, he received a bonus of £2OOO
and £lO,OOO for picture privileges. Almost without
doubt Willard will make a fortune within the next
12 months. Go on the land, young man —-good and
hard.

There was 14st. 91b. of Tom Cowler. who
accompanied James J. Corbett to Australia, when he
climbed into the ring at Sydney Stadium on Satur-
day to exchange swipes with Les O’Donnell. Of the
latter there was but 12st. 21b. The disturbance was
brief and wholly one-sided. O’Donnell was smitten
upwards and downwards and from both sides, and:
when in the sixth round a signal from the police',
inspector caused the referee to forbid further execu-
tion the interference was.. prqb&jjlyHoveleomcd by
O’Donnell as much as by anyone! He had been a
mere chopping block throughout, and was then
wholly at the bigger man’s mercy.
To take the affray as affording a line by which
Cowler can be judged would be unwise. O’Donnell’s
showing was poor. At no time has he much of a
hit, and on Saturday he had rather less than usual.
Also, he persisted in boring in to close range after
having early received rude evidence that this was
useless to shield him from the Englishman’s power-
ful blows. Meeting as ho did with ineffective oppo-
sition, Cowler was not really tried. He is, however,
a fine big fellow, active on his feet, has a varied and
useful collection of punches in either hand, and can
pass them over accompanied by much force. But
there were times when he looked as slow as a funeral.
How Cowler would get on against a man who would
rough it with him over eight or 10 rounds and be
able to hit him afterwards is at best speculative.
He gave the writer the impression of one likely to
soon tire, and not a very difficult proposition for a
quick-hitting performer having poundage somewhere
in the neighborhood of , his own. A match between
him and Ben Doyle would be well worth going to
see. The aldermanic Benjamin might keep Mr.
Cowler fairly busj’.

Thus dope-merchant Premier Holman
(N.S.W.) in his fight against the totalisator and for the
retention of the bookrangers:—“The principal ene-
mies of the workers are. primarily, drink, and,
secondly, gambling.” That being so, it would be
natural to expect that, as leader of the workers,
Holman’s first care would be to fight down the odds
on the side of the enemy. But no. As far as
gambling is concerned, Holman, who is so glib with
his charges of bribery against those in favor of
fair-and-square betting with "the machine, is “dis-
gusted beyond expression to think that the great
Labor movement, as its great achievement and
crowning end, was to introduce the totalisator.”
“Give the devil of gambling his Jew,” says he in
effect, “and as far as I am concerned he can make
th’ sveet thing out of th’ vorkers.”

What has happened to the Great Turf
Scandal which was lately promised to Melbourne by
a skimpy paragraph in the Argus, while the broad
outlines thereof were being whispered in the inner
circle of the horsey world? Is it lost, mislaid, or
simply blown out? A Melbourne horse-owner was to
swear an affidavit and deposit it with the V.R.C.
committee, disclosing the facts of at least one sensa-
tional turf surprise. A notorious trainer and wire-
puller, a fashionable jocke}' and a handicapper were
to figure picturesquely in the revelations. The affi-
davit, according to rumor, would leave the V.R.C.
committee no middle course between luminous revela-
tion and dark silence. The awful truth would have
to come out or be hushed up, and if it came out it
would be a caution to punters. Opposition to the
totalisator would have got a dreadful blow’ from the
publication of that threatened affidavit. Now, what
has become of it?
For the A.J.C. Cumberland Stakes, run on
Saturday, only six horses started in pursuit of the
£2OOO on offer. Mountain Knight went out at less
than an even chance, Ulva’s Isle at 3’s. In taking
these prices punters were more than usually reckless.
The form shown by Ulva’s Isle in his two previous
races at the meeting couldn’t be regarded as giving
him a mortgage over this event, and Mountain
Knight had never previously been tried beyond a
mile and a half. St. Spasa, Sir Alwynton,
Onazer and Carlita were the other runners.
Why Carlita was started is difficult to under-
stand. Having been run off her legs, per-
haps she may now be given the spell she deserves.
Of the race the only thing to be said is that Ulva’s
Isle ran up with the leaders at half-way, was not
seriously challenged afterwards, and won easing up
in very slow time (3min. 3445ec.). Mountain Knight
held St. Spasa easily in a run for second money.
The rest of the field tailed off to nothing. The re-
cent 1000-guinea Hordern purchase, Onazer, had to
he vigorously pushed along by Killorn, who naturally
wanted to keep the others in sight.
The All Aged Stakes was a rattling good race, and
repeated, to some extent, the Doncaster form.
Spurn (Bst. 121 b.) and Brattle (Bst. 121 b.), who had
filled the places behind Garlin in the big event, were
again in front, Spurn winning in really workman-
like manner. This time Garlin was fourth, just behind
Woorak, who landed into the straight first with
Spurn, but was easily settled before the last fur-
long. Traquette, at Bst. 61b., seemed the pick of
the book, and was backed at 5 to 2, but she didn’t
look good enough in. the flesh. She finished sixth.
Two ran well for six furlongs, and then shut up.
The best race of the day was the Easter Stakes, in
which Wallace Isinglass, after being shut in the ruck
until the last furlong’, came with a brilliant run,
and, cutting down Alasco, Taste and Agincourt in the
AT RANDWICK.—J. BARDEN , Trainer.
last hundred yards, won by a length and a half.
It was a very fine effort indeed, and stamps this colt
as something quite out of the ordinary.
The long journey for the A.J.C. Plate was negoti-
ated in smin. 32-Lee. —121 sec. inside the limit set by
the conditions of the prize. As a race the thing was
farcical. Neither Sir Alwynton nor little Frasca
couid make impression on Ulva’s Isle, and he won
practically without effort. The son of Positano has
established a right to be regarded as the best stayer
of his time. Mountain Knight, too, had an easj r
trip in the Place Handicap. He ran into the lead
four furlongs from home, and, easily shaking off the
imported Necktie and the unlucky Taunter, won by
a good two lengths. The colt looked very well, and
has been the only one of the leading three-vear-olds
to go right through the racing- season satisfactorily.
Wallace Isinglass was the only favorite to win
during the day, so Ikey had again nothing to com-
plain about.
Tire meeting finished on Monday. In four
days 24 races had been run. Of these the
favorite won seven, and in three of them the betting
was very restricted. So, taking all the circum-
stances into consideration, The Bulletin prophecy
that the public would get it in the neck, while
McNoses went off with the spoil, was a conservative
estimate of what the situation would be. The pro-
phecy is easy and certain every time.

Jockey A. Wood’s win on Cetigne in the
Sires Produce Stakes at Randwick brought him in
a fee of £l5l.
.j. * * *
Taking the times for the last 10 Mel-
bourne and Sydney Cups it seems that the two-mile
handicap at Fleinington in November is run exactly
2 sec. quicker, on an average, than the two-mile
handicap at Randwick in April, although the Rand-
wick times in the spring, as a rule, are mostly
better than those registered at Caulfield and Fleming-
ton. Owing to damp weather, as a rule, the Sydney
Cup is evidently not as good a test of sustained
speed as the Melbourne event. Hence horses of “no.
class” can get a win or place in the Easter Monday 1
race. For instance, Vasavor, Daisy Chain anil
Jinnee in 19X0, or Street Arab, Patronage and Be-
witcher in 1903. The latest winner and runner-up
were both five-year-olds with an unimpressive past.
On the other hand, in the Melbourne Cup records —
or the A.J.C. Metropolitan records, for that matter
—there have been hardly any gees that didn’t make
a reputation. Sometimes an unmitigated commoner
has slipped into a place for the Melbourne Cup, but
not often. Kingsburgh, last year, had no previous
form to speak of, but he was only a four-year-old, and
the time (3min. 26sec.) bears out the subsequent
statement that Kingsburgh was a wonderfully-
improved animal and a nailer on the day.

At Tatt.’s meeting at Adelaide on Satur-
day Partnership returned £59 6s. to each backer,
though his was only second place in the Breeders’
Plate. McNoses rarely pays 50 to 1 for a win ; as
for a place, one-fourth odds (with a 10 to 1 limit)
is occasionally mentioned. But then the machine
hasn’t to buy cigars and wine.

Onkaparinga (S.A.) Racing Club’s once-
a-year meeting had to battle with drought and dust
this F,aster Monday, and the totalisator recorded only
£21,000, the lowest since 1908, and £lO,OOO worse
than last year. The dust on the roads —and it is a
“picnic” meeting, to which most people drive —was
just horrible. Half profits went to the Belgian
Lund. El Progress, back from success at Fleming-
ton, was made a warm favorite for the Great Eastern
Steeple, but ran poorly, and the race went to old
Tramp, an 11-year-old south-eastern horse, whose
record in this event for the past five years reads
3rd, 2nd, Ist, 3rd, Ist. With list. 81b. he was
giving El Progress a pound, and everything else a
stone at least. McDonald’s Ilevron won the Cup.
Winners were fairly easy to find, and £lO 9s. was
the biggest dividend of the day.
* * * *
Buyers came to the yearling sales in Syd-
ney this year in chastened spirit. The weather was
bad, there was drought hanging round, they hadn't
quite so much money as last year, and, anyhow, the
buying of racing stock is a lottery. Consequently
figures were nearer actual values than at many pre-
vious sales. For the Master-Ardea colt G. S. Yuill
(Vic.) handed over 1600 guineas; “S. A. Rawdon”
(Vic.) parted 1300 and 1100 respectively for colts
bv Mountain King-Lady Mostyn and by Earlston-
Yelor. Others: Filly, Downshire-Desert Rose, A. G.
White (Belltrees), 1100; colt, Mountain King-Bee
Bee, H. Raynor (Randwick), 1000: colt, Mountain
King-Poi Dance, IST. Falkiner (Vic.), 800 ; colt, Down-
shire-Wigelmar, H. A. Currie (Vic.), 775; filly,
Charlemagne TI.-Graffin, P. J. TTeywood (Vic.), 775 :
colt, Achilles-Stepius, A. B. Nagel (Q.), CIO; colt,
Cesarion-Buddah, E. J. Craven (Q.), 600; colt,
Linacre-Patrona, W. Kelso (N.S.W.), 600.

The destination of this season’s Vic.
cricket pennant was decided on Saturday. A fort-
night before, M.C.C.’s opponent, P’ran, had accumu-
lated 199, and the big club had made 77 without
cost. The odds against P’ran were about the size
of Australia’s public debt, but the team owns two
sudden bowlers in Blackie and Junor, and, rain
having descended the night before, there were large
possibilities. Only young Sandford saved Melbourne ;
he carried his bat for 108 and the innings was
closed with nine down for 247 —-48 rubs to the good.
In the hour left for play M.C.C. tried for the straight-
out win, and nearly achieved it, having collared nine
P’ran wickets? for 46 runs when .the light fija|jed.
Of these, Armstrong took seven for 19. Thj’ge missed
catches practically lost P’ran the game and the
pennant; still, they had all the luck of the weather*
and didn’t make the most of it. As it is, the
strongest team on the season’s play collared the
premiership.
Sydney’s first-grade conlpetition appears
pregnant of an exciting finish. The position prior
to the commencement of the game between North
Sydney and Western Suburbs on Saturday was that
a straight-out win would land the West on top. A
win on the first innings (that is, if the game is not
concluded next Saturday) means another meeting
between them to end the argument, three Saturdays
being allowed, if necessary. Any old win will do
N.S. in the match commenced last week on a bowler’s
wicket. Batting first its XI was mowed down by
P. W. Docker for 60, R. V. Minnett (11) being the
only double-figure scorer.’ Docker got eight of the
crowd for 18. Then came the retaliating bomb.
The first five sticks of Western Suburbs fell for 35.
At that stage, however, the useful P. W. Docker and
Taylor made a stand and beat off the attack until,
at 67, they were separated. The, total score was
bumped along to 92, although Hopkins and his allies
were sending along some deadly stuff. He wound up
with five for 44, and Moore with three for five.
North Sydney lias lost one for six in its second
batting.
* * * *
The end of Adelaide cricket season saw
East Torrens turned out of the premiership, which
it had held for three seasons, and for five out of the
last six. The new holder is Adelaide district (the
square mile or so of City proper), which was last on
top ’way back in 1905-6. The result shows once
again the value of bowling. The S.A. XI this
season has been composed of (Say) four University
men, five East Torrens, one Port, and only Campbell
—with perhans Wright—from Adelaide; but the
bowling of the veterans Travers (captain) and
Wright, with McCarron, a junior, put the less fashion-
able club easily top. Whitty (East Torrens), how-
ever, took by far the most wickets in the season,
being just beaten for best average (10.12) by Jose
(University). Then followed McCarron, Travers,
Coombe, Willsmore, Wright and James—all under
16 runs per wicket. It was not a great run-getting
year—the effect of bore-water on turf is still being
argued—and Mavne’s' best aggregate of 571 was the
lowest for 10 .years. He had also the best average,
57.10, though a sensational youngster in the same
East Torrens club. Hodgert, got within one run of
that. But he batted only four times. Steele (Uni.)
was the only other with .an average over 50; then
came Moyes, Ryan, Zsehorn, Middleton, Campbell,
Rundell and Pellew.
■X- * * *
“Coot”: I agree with “Over” (B. l/4/’l5)
that the lengthening of the over to eight balls will
not “brighten” cricket enough to restore it in public
favor. The crowd likes a lively game, and will pay
to see it, as witness the final games of the Victorian
Junior Association recently, when some thousands
attended. Extend the over to eight balls, certainly,
but the difference will be infinitesimal unless you
make it compulsory for a batsman to score once at
least in that time, or else retire.

Victoria’s bowling carnival at Easter
brought Tasmania into its own. The islanders
defeated Waxman’s mightv trundlers in two games
out of three. The win was a sumptuous advertise-
ment for the Australian Bowling Council. Before
this body came into existence the Hobart and Laun-
ceston divisions wouldn’t play in each other’s back-
yard. Now, all pre-council wrangles have vanished.
Peace is upon the sward, and the enemy finds a com-
bined attack awaiting him on the mat. Hence the
fall of the Vic. reps. .
* * * *
Another Australasian record was severed
on Saturday when W. Murray, of the Melbourne
Harriers, concluded his exertions in the ten-mile
amateur walking race for the championship of Vic-
toria. His time was Ihr. 19min. 8 3-ssee. —3min.
11 l-ssec. behind G. E. Earner’s world’s (amateur)
record made at London, 1908. Murray won by half
a mile from F. Drayton (Footscray), 2; and R. H.
Smirl (Hawthorn), 3. _ *
N.S.W. League of Swimmers is churning
through its championships. At Newcastle, the other
day, J. Prior won the 440vds. from A. Car-perry and
A. Robertson in 6min. 15 2-ssec,; and on Saturday,
at Sydney, A. Rollinson defeated Prior and Carberrv
in the mile in 26min. 9 4-ssec. The 500yds. teams’
championship was clipped in by Sydney in smin. 33«ec.
Another recent professional splash was that of Alick
Wickham to reduce the 50yds. record of 23 3-ssec.
He missed it by 2-ssec.
* * * *
Another big fish-man is expected to make
a splash next swimming season in Australasia. Tint
is George R. Hodgson, the Canadian. At the Olympic
Games in Stockholm, July, 1912, he won the 409
metres (free style) in smin. 24 2-ssec. and the 1500
metres (free st3’le) in 22min. By occupation he is a
student at Montreal University.
* * * *
N.S.W. amateur golf champion J. I>.
I-lowden, who added the Blue Mountain champion-
ship to his list the other day, is the most accom-
plished player the Ma State has seen for a lons’
time. In the recent win he went the rounds in 69
and 73 (142)—15 strokes better than A. W. H.
Padfield, SO and 77 (157).

“Bumpkin”: Despite disturbing influences
the 18ft. sailing boats on Port Jackson had a record
season for 19i4-5. Nearly £9OO was raced fcr.
Of this Kismet won £B6, five others collected
over £5O, six over £4O, and 11 shared the re-
mainder. Sailing races are difficult to handicap ;
there is always a danger of a liberally-treated craft
getting a favorable slant and, by romping home in
advance of the fleet, making the hanclicappers look
foolish. Hence, five of the back-markers head the
winning list, and receive more than a third of the
prize-money. The sailing boats on Sydney Harbor
are not “amateurs,” but correspond to the “League”
in football and swimming. The amateur sailing
and yachting clubs decided not to race during the
season on account of the war, hence unusual lime-
light was thrown on the “professional” ■ 18’.s,
although both registers are composed of preeiselv the
same boats and the longshoreman can’t tell the differ-
ence between the Sydney Flying Squadron and the
Sydney Sailing Club. As remarked, Kismet headed
the list of winners in both the Flying Squadron’and
Sailing Club events, won two out: of three champion-
ships and was second in the third. The old Aus-
tralian, for long Sydney’s champion 18-footer, fin-
ished fourth for the season.

RECIPE FOR BALD-HEADS
Well-known Politician Nearly Bald
Now Has New Growth of Hair.
Tells How He Did It.
A popular politician, well known on
account of his baldness and liis ready wit,
surprised his friends by appearing with a
new growth of hair. Many of his friendgs
did not know him, and others thought he
had a wig. On being asked how he did it,
he made the following statement: “I attri-
bute the growth of my hair to the following
simple recipe, which any lady or gentleman
can mix at home. To a half-pint of water
add loz. of bay rum, a small box of Orlex
Compound and loz. of glycerine. Apply to
the scalp two or three times a week with •
the finger tips. It not only promotes the
growth of the hair, but removes dandruff,
scalp humors and prevents the hair from fall-
ing out. It darkens streaked, faded, grey
hair and makes the hair soft and glossy.
These ingredients can be purchased at any
chemist’s at very little cost and mixed at
home.* [7

AGONY OF RHEUMATISM
DRIVEN AWAY AS IF BY MAGIC.
HOW TO PROVE IT.
Rheumatism is caused by a curious poisonous
acid in the blood. This acid settles in the
joints and muscles, and causes that awful
agonising pain of backache, rheumatism,
gout, gravel, inflammation of the. bladder,
etc. Weakened kidneys are at the bottom of
it all.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the poison-
ous pain-causing acid right out of the
system. Every suffering reader of this
paper can prove for himself, with one or
two doses, that these pills do really touch
the weak spot—the kidneys and bladder.
V hen you see the “blue” you know it’s true.
To cure kidney trouble of any kind you
must positively get rid of the ' cause—the
poisonous uric acid. Remember, to do this,
a real remedy must pass through the kidneys
and the bladder, and not through the bowels,
as most kidney pills do. When you see the
urine change to a muddy bluish color—a
feature which distinguishes De Witt’s Pills
from all others —you know beyond all doubt
that they have put their healing touch on
the right spot—the kidneys and the bladder.
A wonderful pill—straight to the kidneys
—that is the reason why De Witt’s give
such amazingly quick relief —every time. A
permanent cure follows in almost every case.
DE WITT’S KIDNEY AND BLADDER PILLS
can be obtained at any of the branches of
Washington 11. Soul Pattinson & Co., Ltd.,
Sydney: Longmore’s The Melbourne Phar-
macy, Bourke Street, Melbourne; and all
leading chemists at 2/9 and 5/6 per large
box. The 5/6 size is two and a half times
as large as the 2/9, and contains enough
doses to last you three weeks.
Try your nearest chemist, but if you have
any difficulty in obtaining De Witt’s Pills,
send the price of the package required to
either of the firms mentioned above, and the
goods will be sent by return. - post free.
Try the 2/9 size if you like —-but start at
once, and you will then understand why
thousands upon thousands of sufferers, in
all parts of the world, praise De Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills. But you must
be sure you get De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills, in large blue and gold boxes.*

Harry Lauder, too, is on active service.

long way to escape from the German bands
when they were still in business in xVus-
tralia. In my opinion all bands and bands-
men ought to be sent to the Front—the worse
the band the more to the Front. Also, one
cornet player in my own street should be
taken to the seat of war —that is, if the
seat of war is its most deadly part. If it
isn’t he should be sent to it, wherever it is.
“II.O.”: Melodrama patrons, in Melbourne
at any rate, are showing a tendency to bite
the tripe that is supposed to feed them, in-
stead of swallowing it. The recent “guying”
of a piffle-play, which a while ago would have
Avon through on its demerits, is a case in
point; and scarcely a Saturday night passes
without an audience manifesting disrespect
for one or other of the characters or situa-
tions they were Avont to reverence. On several
recent occasions the entry of the ruined
heroine with the epilogue of her sad story
in her arms has called forth ribald comment
from the gallery, and the inevitable “Put
’im out” has been received Avitli a surprising
lack of unanimity.
Uncle Sam is so resolute for peace that
he does not noAV allow any allusion to the
war to be made on any stage in the United
States ; and in the balls of the “movies” the
exhibition of Avar films has been altogether
suppressed. One quaint result was that
novelist-playAvright A. E. W. Mason, Avho
went across with J. M. Barrie on a mission
to explain the reasons Avhy Britain jumped
into the ring, had to return to London with
his lecture undelivered. Mason says that,
taken in the lump, Sam is distinctly anti-
German. The untalkative Barrie has not
said anything; he seems to be thinking that
Sam might love us altogether he not
Samuel more.
_ “N’importc” : “Frank” (B. 25/2/’l5) gets
bis foot off tin' narrow path of verity re
the movies at Tahiti. At Papeete there are
tAVo large wooden buildings, the Casino and
the Palais, Avhore films are screened. But
the buildings are not used exclusively for
movies. Every week, almost, one will find
notices affixed to the trees in the Rue de
Rivoli and other thoroughfares advertising
“La Boxe,” in French and Tahitian, between
the Tahitian equivalent for the Mile-end
Midget and the Woolloomooloo Wonder.
Further, the enterprising proprietor of the
Casino boards the Union Co.’s liners and
seeks Aolunteers from the ships to give a
variety turn at his house the e\ r ening they
are in port. Outside of Papeete I can only
call to mind one permanent cino. hall be-
tween Point Venus and Tautira, i.c., the
Tivoli.
Before the Naval Combat show opened at
Melbourne Glaeiarium, M. P. Adams, the
acting manager, circularised all the local par-
sons _on the wise presumption that he had
got just the sort of entertainment to fetch
’em. The shepherds mostly seem to have
read, marked and imvardly digested the cir-
cular in an approving spirit. But a certain
wowser parson, when he got his circular at
breakfast time, swallowed his porridge in
hot haste and wrote a meek and nasty letter:
Respectfully I draw your attention to the fact that
I am not an advertising agent for the Picture busi-
ness, hut a Minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
Apparently you have failed to distinguish the differ-
ence..,. In any spiritual matter I would he glad to
assist. War is never, and can never be, wholesome,
and its very nature is un-Christlike.

“Parisine”: A revival, on the French
stage, of Zola’s “Ventre de Paris” leads me
to ask if it might not be welcomed in Syd-
ney and Melbourne. Such a difference from
the nauseous hug-mug drama, the everlast-
ing leading man and leading woman trying
ali kinds of embracery and slobbery for'the
delectation of the ruling young ladies! The
grand scene adapted by Busnach is the
market. Vegetables, flowers, meat, and,
beyond all, you see the Church of St.
Eustache. It is sunrise. Whiffs of such a
scone Avere given us in Charpentier’s
“Louise” and Puccini’s “Bohhme.” Another
scene of the “Ventre” is inside a realistic
pork-shop. Everything deliciously sensuous,
even to the joints suspended, and strings of
sausages and tripe. “Zeal for exactitude,”
says a critic. Claire Mehudin impersonates
the fish-shop, rough and salt, with “the grand
body of a goddess!” Marjolin, fresh and
fleshy, embodies the poultry shop. Sarriette
is the divinity of the fruits, and fitly fruity.
Yet the chief heroine is Lisa, belle of the
pork shop. Her rival, Florent, comes in
a-top of a load of cauliflowers. Oh, give us
this! Cut and come again.
CAN THE DEAF HATE?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lissauer, author ot “The Chant of Hate,” is touring
Germany, and declaiming his poem wherever an
audience can be gathered together.
—Cheery news item.
The poet raved as a poet can,
But he shunned the eyes of one silent man,
Whose gaze cut through like a rifle ball
And pinned the poet against the wall.
The poet yelped as a poet may;
But the dumb man stared in his dreadful way,
Till the words of hate like a blessing fell,
And the thin voice cracked like an ancient bell.
The chanting finished, the poet came
And cursed the man with the eyes of flame:
“If you like it nodt, v’y you nodt go oudt?”
Said the Eyes: “I am deaf! lot vos it aboudt?”

“The wealth of both the Indies cannot
redeem one single opportunity which
you have once let slip.”
And this is a grand—we had almost written a
“life’s” —opportunity to secure a Piano of un-
doubted integrity as to tone and construction at
a wonderfully low, quick-sale price. For those
who cannot play the Piano the music avenue is
opened to them by the fact that several “Apollo”
Combination Player Pianos are in the sale.
Fifteen days from now and your Piano-saving

We Repeat the Main Sale Facts here:
The Instruments are all of high-grade manufacture, and
comprise Upright Grands, by Allison, Broadwood, and several
“Apollo” Combination Pianos.
Each instrument is virtually as good as new —excepting that
its case is tarnished, for they have never been out of our

The Special Prices are genuine reductions, not a “mark up for

any one of the Instruments, a Piano or a Player.

But its wonderful accuracy
is only one of the reasons why

is the anchoring properties of
the Ross .280 Sporting Am-

delivers a smashing blow as it
expands in the body of your

instead of allowing it to escape

sporting bullets.

RITA MOYA discourses on
NATURAL BEAUTY,
and Low to obtain it.
To-day every woman of taste and refinement avoids the use of cosmetics or made-up
toilet preparations which give an artificial appearance. The fresh, natural complexion that
few women have, and every woman desires, is Pest obtained by use of original ingredients
already at hand or which can be obtained from any reliable chemist. My advice is to avoid
the use of most made-up face creams, rouge and beautifying preparations. They are usually
obvious and often disappointing. If you will get only the proper original ingredients you will
be satisfied with the result. Insist on having what you ask for. If the chemist does not
happen to have it in stock, he can immediately get it from his wholesaler.
Good Shampoo Important. —The hair should
be allowed to breathe, and the greasy film
around each strand must be removed with a
mild non-alkaline shampoo. Soaps should be
tabooed. The very best solution for the pur-
pose can be made by dissolving a teaspoonful
of stallax granules in a cup of hot water. It
stimulates the scalp to healthy action, and at
the same time leaves the hair in that soft,
fluffy condition so much admired. Any chemist
can supply you with an original packet of
stallax, sufficient to make Jo or 30 shampoos.
Magic for Superfluous Hair. —It is astound-
ing the number of women who suffer from
unsightly growths of hair on the face, and it
will come as a piece of good news to know
that there is a simple substance known as
powdered pliemihol which will remove it im-
mediately and permanently. Mix a small
quantity into a thin paste with a little water,
and apply to the objectionable growths. In
two minutes all trace of the hair will have
entirely vanished, and your skin will be as
soft and smooth as a child's.
To have Smooth, White Skin all through the
Winter. —Does your skin chap or roughen
easily, or become unduly red or blotchy? Let
me tell you a quick and easy way to over-
come the trouble and keep your complexion
beautifully white, smooth and soft. Just get
some ordinary mercolised wax at the chem-
ist’s, and use a little before retiring as you
would use cold cream. The wax, through
some peculiar action, flecks off the rough, dis-
colored or blemished skin. The worn-out
cuticle comes off just like dandruff on a dis-
eased scalp only in almost invisible particles.
Mercolised wax simply hastens Nature’s
work, which is the rational and proper way to
attain a perfect complexion, so much sought
after, but very seldom seen. The process is
perfectly simple and quite harmless.
For T>ry, Irritating and DandrufF.v Scalps.
'-Nothing can compare with the following
recipe for the above condition, and until you
have rectified any trouble in this direction ii
is useless to expect the hair to grow healthy
and vigorous. Mix a package of boraniun
with -}-pint of bay rum, shake the bottle well
and allow to stand for 30 minutes, then add
i-pint cold water and strain. This simpl ■
home remedy will stimulate the hair roots to
their normal functions, resulting in a beauti
ful growth of new hair.
Rouge Not Necessary.—lf you must add a
little color to the cheeks please do not use
rouge; it is always so painfully obvious that
women of refinement have now discarded il
for ever. There is a little-known substance
called colliandum obtainable at most cliem
ist’s, which can be used in its place. It gives
a perfectly natural tint and defies the closest
scrutiny, besides having the undoubted ad
vantage of not rubbing off.
The Powder Puff Passes.—A persistently
shiny nose, or a dull, lifeless complexion
drives many a woman to cosmetics and conse-
quent despair. And all the time a simple
remedy lies at hand in the home. Get from
your chemist about an ounce of cleminite.
and add sufficient water to dissolve it. A
little of this simple lotion is Nature's own
beautifier. It is very good for the skin and
instantly gives the complexion a soft, velvety,
youthful bloom that any woman might envy.
It lqsts all day or evening, renders powdering
entirely unnecessary and absolutely defies
detection.
Miscellaneous Hints. —For lips inclined to t>«
rough or harsh use a soft stick of prolactum.
An ideal complexion soap is one called
pilenta. It contains no free alkali, and is as
near neutrality as science can make it.
To make the eyelashes grow long, dark and
curling, massage them gently with mennaline.
It is quite a harmless substance, and will not
injure tire eyes.

AN/EMIA
(Poorness of Blood)
Pallor
Depression
Palpi-
tation
Exhaustion
Be sure you take Iron ‘Jelloids’ when Anaemic.
In Anaemia the whole body suffers, because the rich red blood
upon which the well-being of the whole body depends is lacking.
The system then becomes weakened and debilitated, the nerves
are starved, the heart is overworked. The result is Lack of Energy,
Depression, Paleness of Lips and Cheeks, Breathlessness and
Exhaustion after slight Exertion. To remove these symptoms the
blood must be enriched and strengthened—and the simplest, most
pleasant and economical way to do this is to take Iron ‘Jelloids.’
Iron Jelloids
enrich the blood - renew vitality
The Revd. A. J. Waldron, Vicar of Brixton, says : “I have heard
“ about your Iron ‘Jelloids ’ from a Doctor, and have recently had occasion
to take them. lam strongly of the opinion that if the public realised the
“fact that they haveathand at sucli a small cost such a pleasant and efficient
“remedy for Anaemia, and such a splendid tonic for Nerve-strain, etc.,
“ many a home would be happier and many a life made brighter.”
A fortnight's trial ( Price 1/6 ) will convince you.

THE outstanding charm and originality of the
shoe here illustrated lie in its side fastening
and fascinating side ornament. The effect
gained by this mere transposing of a buckle is
amazing. It gives the foot a delightfully smart,
almost saucy look, besides accentuating the arch of
the instep. Inrleed, so charming is this type
of shoe that, in a pleasant variety of styles
and lasts, it figures largely in the new Bos-
tock range of models lately arrived at the
leading stores.
Ladies will find this range a perfect
treasure-trove of delightful shoes, all striking
that particular note of individuality which
makes them elegant as well as smart, and all
possessed of unrivalled fitting properties.
Purchasers should see that the name Bostobk
is stamped on the soles of every pair.

“Gns _ Gosli” learns with bitterness what
may befall a “leading citizen”:—
I have achieved popularity in our suburb largely
through the efforts of my wife, one of the founders
of the \\ oman Helpers’ League. She hopes to be
mayoress in a year or two. The other night, on
my return from a Rifle Movement meeting, I saw
that her tender feelings had been lacerated as if
by a sausage machine. She had had a caller—a poor
woman whose husband had enlisted and gone to
Egypt. There he had died from measles or
pyramids, or something, leaving his widow to rear
a tribe of young Australians. The eldest was in
hospital recovering from diphtheria; the next had
mumps; every other child was a sufferer from
gastritis or whooping cough. The distracted mother
had her pension, of course, but she was up against
it, nevertheless, what with medical fees and the
high cost of living. So, having heard of the patriotic
efforts on the part of my wife and myself, she had
come for temporary relief. But she didn’t want
charity. No! All she wanted was a day’s washing.
She got it and at 8 a.m. next day she duly arrived.
She brought the youngest with her, as it fretted
if left at the creche. She was an insignificant
female in a shabby blue print skirt, but wo were
proud to welcome her as a fellow countrywoman who
had nobly sacrificed her man at her country’s call.
I determined to refer to the matter the next time
I spoke at a patriotic meeting. At the door that
evening my wife greeted me with a face of woe.
Behind her stood a large policeman—in his arms
a baly. From the Law I learned that the soldier’s
widow had levanted with (1) the jewellery from
the front bedroom, (2) a sum of money with which
the tradesmen were going to be paid, (3) a bundle/'
of wearing apparel and (4) my presentation watch.
All that she left in exchange was the baby. The
Law also observed (1) that the “pore widow
woman’s” husband was serving a stretch at Long
Bay, (2) that she was in the habit of adopting
babies, and (3) that she had exchanged an infant
for jewellery, etc., at another house. Later at
the police-station, the sub-inspector told me, as a
“curious coincidence,” that the other victim had
been “connected prominently with patriotic move-
ments, too.”
SCARED BY A BULL.
Up a tree I scrambled out of danger
When across a field a savage bull did race,
Narrowly I’d escaped a mortal butting
To be finished by a toss up into space.
Loudly wafted out the cracking of a stockwhip
Stop where j'ou are a voice did loudly call,
Around a branch I twisted like a serpent
To save myself against an heavy fall.

HAVE you ever stopped to consider what it has meant
to your nation ~to Australia at this time of war
to possess successful Manufacturing Industries ?
The possession of Small Arms and Ammunition Factories, Engineering and
Coach Works, Boot and Hat Factories, Woollen Mills, Jam and Biscuit
Factories, Meat Preserving Works, etc., has permitted the full equipment,
clothing and provisioning of the Largest Expeditionary Force which has
ever been transported across the seas from hemisphere to hemisphere. t
has enabled Australia, self-relying, and with pride, to make immediate
and practical expression of her loyalty to the Empiie.
But the production of munitions of war has not measured the full value
to Australia of her manufacturing industries. The manufacture of Harves-
ters, Furniture, Pianos, Locomotives and the thousands of other goods made
in Australia, has assisted in the flow of commerce necessary to her military
and naval life.
The importation of cheap German goods has not assisted in the establish-
ment of these manufacturing industries. Nor has the importation of German
Pianos assisted in the development of Australia s resources.

“There is really nothing to prevent
George Reid’s immediate return to Federal
politics,” says a Melbourne paper. Nothing
insuperable. The doorways can be widened.
“Lee-Metford,” from the range : —-
After long, sunless days spent with your face four
inches above an account book, it is a joyous thing to
find yourself lying on the mound with the square
white target staring at you from afar, a clean rifle
in your hands, and 10 cartridges (all of ’em possible
“bulls”) lying ready on the crown of your old felt
hat just where you can reach them easily.
The man next door has taken a deep breath and
snuggled his cheek to the polished butt. A few sec-
onds’ suspense and then, inexpressibly loud and sharp
—“Bang —Whir-r-r!” A jet of yellow dust leaps
up behind the target and drifts, away on the light
breeze. The square target itself slowly rolls over
and then comes up again to the perpendicular with
a round black dot just under the black ball that is
the 8-inch “bull.” At the same time the red-painted
side of a kerosene tin mounted on a long pole pokes
up from the trench and is drawn back. “Inner!”
says the scorer judicially. “Your turn, No. 2!”
The first cartridge is shoved into the breech with
eager fingers; then forward with the bolt and down.
The well-oiled mechanism gives a throaty, gratified
ker-luck as if it liked the taste of what it had just
swallowed. Now the cheek goes down to the smooth
butt, and the left arm (pray that there’s no sharp
grit under the elbow !) brings the heavy black barrel
up slowly till the foresight peeps suddenly up through
the centre of the U on the backsight. That’s enough!
It has risen to the imaginary wire the eye draws
across the tiny U ravine. Now the black foresight
is standing up fairly in the centre, and true with
the white hair-line that the pedestal of the U wears
on the rearward side. Now for the distant bull!
At last! Got it resting like a ball on' top of the
fore'sight. A deep breath, and.... for the pull!
The eager, crooked forefinger moves gently back....
The waiting barrel starts to wobble shamelessly and
the black bull shows a disposition to float sideways
off the foresight. Wobble! — wobble! Pull again!
Your chest is bursting but it doesn’t matter. Pull!
Wobble! Hurry up! the sights are growing misty
with the strain. Pull —pull! bang! The relieved
rifle jumps in your hands and you momentarily lose
all sense of the target. Then the breath is expelled
luxuriously, the bolt is wrenched up and back, and
the empty cartridge-case hops out of the breech and
tinkles amongst the stones as your target slowly
rolls over and down for inspection, and the rifle is
lowered for a rest. The white face on the kerosene
tin rises like a welcome ghost. “A bull! I thought
so!” says the scorer, and respectfully credits you
with 5.
And, lying there on your chest, waiting for i the
next chance, you say nothing, but cheer inwardly
and give a loving side-glance at the other nine
cartridges waiting on top of your hat. For, if’you
are only enthusiastic enough, every shot is a com-
plete adventure in itself. But if you are a newchum
you privately wonder how on earth you managed to
do it With the wavering barrel drawing large-scale
landcsapes on the target during the last breathless
moment before the tension-snapping “Bang!”
A hint of the horrible misconduct of the
Gerliog invaders of France is conveyed in
two bills before the French Senate, one to
legalise abortion in the case of French
women who have been outraged by soldiers ;
the second to provide for foundling homes
for children begotten in such circumstances.
“Lluffin-Guffin” : A fortnight ago, prodded
by tales of coach-drivers’ performances, I
reported that Jimmy Lyall had been carry-
ing mails per horseflesh from Hamilton to
Harrow (Vic.) every work-day since the
Germans were last in Paris in 1870. This
week the ghosts of all the horses that haunt
that track will rise up and paw the dese-
crated earth —after 45 years “Jimmy” has
discarded the whip and the coach, and taken
to a tin of lubricant and a motor-’bus.
G. A. Julius, of Sydney, whose tote
machine is being installed in Perth, was
formerly connected with the W.A. State
Railways, where, under the brilliant C. T.
O’Connor, he pushed himself up to the posi-
tion of Chief Mechanical Draftsman. It
was during his term that the workshops
were shifted from Fremantle to Midland
Junction. Invention is his hobby; he has
patented pianola-record cutters, voting
machines, telephone recorders and tote
machines, and is still going strong. His
father is Bishop of Christchurch (M.L.) ;
his wife a daughter of C. T. O’Connor, one-
time Engineer-in-Cliief of W.A.
“E.W.”: When aviation was a young and
most expensive game I met an Australian
in London—C. Gurney Grime, of Newcastle
(N.S.W.) —putting brain and muscle into
the business. In the first “park” of flying
machines that had Wembley, North London,
as their jumping-off spot, a machine designed
by Gurney figured. My memory always
pictures him as fondling a propeller, a per-
fect beauty, built of various layers of Aus-
tralian wood. Lie couldn’t stop feeling the
exquisite lines or drinking in the color of
its harmonious curves. Are the propellers
used on aeroplanes now in the Common-
wealth made of Australian timber? If not,
why?
Charles James Roberts,. M.L.C., entered
his 70th lap on March 29th. As long
ago as 1878 he was mayor of Syd-
ney; lie was not only Sydney’s young-
est municipal boss (he was only 33),
but he is also the oldest living ex-boss. In
18S2 he was elected to the Assembly for
the Hastings, and sat till 1890, when he
was appointed to the Council. He was
P.M.G. in the Parkes Ministry from 1887
to 18S9. For his municipal services he was
made a C.M.G. —which was freely trans-
lated into Corner Market and George, where
Roberts’s Llotel has stood for a couple of
generations.

The Gresham

The Sewerage System has been in-

overcomes Brisbane’s greatest menace.
Proprietor,
T. M. AHERN.
IN
BANANA LAND
“Flinderino”: It is not generally known
that there is a busy seaport in Australia
named after explorer Kennedy, the man who
was speared to death in 1848 by Cape Yont
blacks. Hands up those who know where
it is! Well, Port Kennedy is the official
name of the one and only town on Thursday
Island.
Brisbane dailies have been boosting the
two-party system as the only one possible;
yet, in spite of the “impossibility” of any-
thing else, Queensland sees three principal
parties again going to the poll. The
Farmers’ Union pushes on independent of
Denhamism, and will come back numerically
strong. Also W. S. Murphy, of Croydon,
the sole Independent Oppositionist in the
House, promises to once more return vic-
torious and again successfully lead, coerce,
cajole and consolidate the tiny faction of
one incorporated inside his own free-and-
easy clothes.
It is printed in Queensland papers with
wearisome reiteration that under Minister
Paget’s regime the State’s railways have
increased from 3359 miles in 1908 to 4904
miles at present. One would imagine Paget
had built the lines out of his private purse,
and that, but for him, railway-laying would
have stood still. The fact is the lines have
extended phenomenally as part of a big
boom policy, and restraint is the last thing
Paget and his colleagues ever thought of.
Seeing that Queensland already has more
railways per head than almost any other
country in the world, it is about time a
Northern Government took credit, not for
piling still higher the pile that is already
too high, but for putting in the peg’ and
making the existing lines a trifle more pro-
ductive. In a country where every 130
people—men. women and children—have to
support a line of railway, there is something
better for a Government to do than to boast
of the additional mileage it has built and
not paid for.
“Cleveland”: “Globe Cairns” (B.
18/3/T5) asseverates that the claimants
for a meteorological station in N.Q. have no
hope of getting it if their only argument
hangs on the vagaries of the telegraph ser-
vice. He states that the lines have not been
down for more than two days within the
last four years. Well, two days of cyclone
is quite enough to play havoc with a man’s
belongings that are not anchored down.
“But,” says this correspondent, “of course
the lighthouses are always advised.” Let’s
see what that means. A ship leaves Thurs-
day Island bound south, and worms her way-
as far as Grassy Hill (Cooktown), 440
miles, before anyone is able to throw her a
word of advice unless she has wireless.
From here she will go 12 miles to Archer
Point, and from there will be left to her
own devices until she gets to Cape Cleve-
land, if bound to Townsville, or to Cape
Bowling Green (260 miles). From here no
one will care os. 2d. what becomes of her
until she reaches Sandy Cape, about 500
miles, even though she has passed close
enough to Dent Island to shout the war
news to the lightkeepers, and Pine Islet and
North Reef lights within signalling distance.
So that in a distance of 1207 miles she has
only four lights—which are in pairs, and
really only count as two —that are in touch
with the telegraph system. North Barnard,
Lady Blliot and the three above-named > are
as informative as an oyster, and as dumb
as “Globe Cairns” oiiclit to be until he
learns more of his subject.
The vacancies in tlm Ministry made by
the death of Barlow and the retirement of
Paget have just been filled. The appointment
of Douglas as honorary Minister is chiefly
interesting as placing on the Treasury Bench
a son of John Douglas, one-time Premier of
Banar.aland and for many years Resident at
Thursday Island. As managing-director of
Elliott, Donaldson, and Douglas, and son-in-
law of rag-merchant T. C. Beirne, young
Douglas is making fast progress to the front
in commercial circles. Colonel Colin Rankin,
the new Minister for Railways, is a coal
and sugar magnate of much tonnage, who
has developed in the last four years into
one of the Assembly’s leading politicians.
Rankin went through the Boer war with
much credit and no scratches, and has
figured of late as leader of the seceding
Farmers’ Party, which has occasioned Lib-
eralism much unhappiness. The elevation of
Rankin is a significant move on the verge
of an election.
“CAN VASSER, CURE THYSELF! ”
HEAD OF FIRM (Sneezers Certain Cough and Cold Cure): “Here you've been a fortnight
in a district notorious for influenza and you haven't sold a single bottle!”
CANVASSER: “Well, dabbit, I caught the dabbed thig by self the first dite lavas there."
Died the other day, R. W. Scott, one of
the best-known of Central Queensland jour-
nalists. He set the wheels going to grind out
the Gympie Miner* afterwards worked the
lever at Ravenswood, and finally, deciding
that there was too much excitement and too
little profit in goldfields journalism, set up
his plant at Proserpine, and gave an eye to
the cane beetle till he died. He,was a Tas-
manian to begin with.
“Itan”: B’ananaland ‘still tops Australia!
ip the matter, of wool clips. Last year the
Ma State’s biggest shed was Goonoo
Goonoo, with 140,000 sheep. The next was
Gillendoon with 90,000; then Eremeran
with 80,000 and Lake Midgeon with 70,000.
In Queensland Wellshot heads the lot with
250,000, followed up t" by Terrick Terrick
190,000, Bowen Downs 175,000, and a num-
ber over 100,000.
“P. 8.”: Among Bananaland railways the
Miles-Taroom, line is a shining sample of
what the political engineer can do. Two
rival towns cldmored to have it started from
their back yards—Miles (Murilla electorate)
and Chinchilla (Dalby). Dalby was con-
sidered safe Liberal; Murilla was doubtful.
So Miles was made the pushing-off place. A
timber tramway was built along the - Chin-
chilla-Taroom survey line. Then the timber
for the line was hauled 28 miles
back to Chinchilla and then on to Miles.
This tramway will need an extension very
soon in the direction of Taroom, and Banana-
land will have a tramway out into the iron-
bark country, a ruined forest, a few timber-
cutters living mainly on the memories of
past good times, selectors trying to coax a
living out of very unresponsive soil, and a
railway which, for 75. miles out of 100
traverses pear-infested country. Inciden-
tally, Bananaland will also have sound
reasons for blowing up the Party Svstem
with dynamite.
“L. Namo” : Had the C.S.R. Co. believed
me when I told it, back in 1909, that‘an
entomologist, investigating sugar-cane pests
in Papua on behalf of the big Hawaiian
Sugar Planters’ Association, had discovered
a fly-parasite whose sole object in life was
to exterminate phenopherus obscura (the
sugar-cane- beetle), cane cockies up North
would not now be awake all night contend-
ing with the destructive insects. The reason
why Papuan cane is so vigorous and clean
is (according to the scientist aforemen-
tioned) that there is one of the parasitical
flies to every cane-beetle in the Possession.
The fly conducts the attack through the egg
of its host.
Harry Marshall, who has secured the
lucky number in the draw for the Under-
Secretaryship for Mines, gets through life
with a smile on his face. He is perennially
happy and a thoroughly “good sort.” Born
in Brisbane 54 years ago, his abundant
energy in early life found a safety-valve in
athletics. He pulled a sturdy stroke with
the oar. He is very good friends with the
press. Yet, after being interviewed by a
troublesome reporter one day, he pulled up
the leg of his unmentionables, flashed a
..gnarled and knotted mass of calf muscles at
the offender, and beamingly told him: “I
got those muscles kicking out nuisances.”
There’s a pleasant' scrimmage in a couple
of constituencies alongside Brisbane. Labor-
member Kirwan has two opponents for
North Brisbane—ex-mayor Jenkinson, who
previously represented Fassifern, and is the
true blue Liberal; and LancelotjWctor Wil-
kinson, who alleges that he is*the one and
only National Liberal. In.the Merthyr dis-
trict Tom Welsby, the “Liberal” who repre-
sented the electorate in the last Parliament,
has had-enough, and two others of the same
brand Bayley and Lackey—are trying to
make themselves heard above the clamor of
the Labor candidate, McLachlan.
Captain Mathews, pilot and harbormaster
at Port Douglas, has drawn his last pay
and is now taking a spell. He drifted to
Australia from London in 1854 on the
barque Agricola, and a few years later
started trading with two small vessels
between Rockhampton, Yamba and Raglan
Cieek. He built the first sea-going yessel
on the I itzroy, and in it conveyed passen-
gers to Mackay and Townsville. In 1878
he was at the wreck of the Gothenberg, and
escaped' to join the Government service as

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, April 10, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
Om vice-royalties have had a week pal-
pitating with excitement. They looked
over the General Hospital and the Mater
Misericord he. Hospital, and on Thursday
his Ex. presided at the annual meeting of
the former. To-day Lady Goold-Adams
went to watch the Red Gross tennis tour-
nament at Auchenfiower. while her official
half opened a new Gospel tent somewhere
in the suburbs.
r , P le w eek s illuminating item was the
Tait-Willcocks wedding. Most of our Very
Best passed their congratulations at the
\\ lllcockses home, JVynberg, New Farm,
gardens were beautifully embellished
i lB '. *’. flower-beds being outlined
with twinkling fairy lamps, while Chinese
lanterns bloomed upon the trees. The
bride, upholstered in satin and much Lim-
'ace, had for her bridesmaids Hazel
Vyillcocks, her youngest sister, a handsome
Titian-haired child, aiid pretty Winnie
\Velsby, only daughter of Commodore
lom.’ These auxiliaries wore white ninon
and satin, with small blue horseshoes fasten-
ing the bodice, and becoming caps of black
tulle. Stuart Tait and Colin Clark propped
up the groom. After the formal promises
had been muttered, the guests were resusci-
tated under a marquee on the lawn. The
National Anthem was sung with great en-
thusiasm, and the Allies’ flags were waved
all over the place. I don’t know what this
had to do with it all, but they say it’s good
for digestion.
Another wedding, which happened last
week, lopped yet another off Hie fast-dimin-
ishing unmarried portion of the Telegraph’s
writing staff. The lopped was S. G.
Sowden, son of W. J. Sowden, of the
Adelaide Register, and the accessory
before _ and after the fact was Miss Edna
Dellbridge. a charming and diminutive
Adelaide lady. The Telegraph’s corps
handed over good wishes in a silver entree
dish, or as many as could be crowded into
the hardware.
Yet another addition to the matrimonial
ranks (see that you don’t read it “cranks”)
occurred on Monday, when Frances Wall,
who was one of the first girls to be wel-
comed when the G.P.O. was opened to
women, was married to surveyor Carson*
brother of Knox Carson, 8.A.,' headmaster
of Bowen House School.
The A.J.A. (Queensland branch) had a
tea party on Thursday afternoon, as a fare-
well to Colonel Spencer Browne, who has
sharpened his war cutlery and is off to let
some hot air out of the Sossage industry.
Mrs. Spencer Browne, in silver grey crepe
de chine and a ducky black velvet hat, was
a guest, and came in for a proper share of
congratulations for contributing her hus-
band to the Man Fund. After the tea and
cake had fallen back before a frontal attack
president Bryan passed a gold wristlet
watch to the Colonel, from Queensland
journalists. A feature of the jewel is the
A.J.A. badge engraved on the back.
To-night, at Rowe’s Cafg, the Courier
staff is busy farewelling Colonel Browne on
its own account. A pair of field-glasses is
their token of affection.
Dr. F. W. Woolrabe, once Health Officer
in Brisbane, has been appointed medical
adviser to the Ministry of the Interior of
Siam. Conveniently for everybody, the doc.
has a good knowledge of Malay.
Brisbane is working hard to provide a
recreation .room for northern soldiers as a
lure to keep them out of hotels. To a mere
feminihe intellect it seems that it would be
better for everybody, including the boys
themselves, if they were allowed to have a
wet canteen, and, at the. same time, a regu-
lation prohibiting a publican serving a sol-
dier ih uniform. Men don’t get drunk in
camp, whatever the wowsers may say to the
contrary, and it’s far better to allow them
to have good liquor in moderation than to be
at the mercy of sly-grog sellers, who have
done a roaring trade since the canteen went
dry at Enoggera.
Dr. Wassell, Govt. Medical Officer at
Thursday Island, and a son of the well-liked
Brisbane veteran, J. L. Wassell, crossed the
Big Divide this week. Something pierced
his foot while he was fishing, and he died of
blood-poisoning.
Mrs. Neil Cameron, a sister of Archie
Meston. this State’s rep. in Sydney, died
there a few days ago. She and Archie were
the children of early-day farmers at
Ulmarra (N.S.W.). The daughter (Helen)
married Alex. Cameron, a Clarence River
storekeeper, who started the town of Mac-
lean—originally Rocky Mouth, on account
of a bar across the south arm. After some
years of widowhood Mrs. Cameron married
Neil, of the same clan, who was for years
manager of the Sydney Farmer’s and Dairy-
man’s Milk Co. An uncle, Robert Meston.
reached N.S.W. in 1845 as immigration
agent for John Bull’s Government. Later
he was a squatter in New England, wrote
gallons concerning the hayseed and cow
industries, and was member for New Eng-
land in the first N.S.W. Parliament.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

E. H. Lock, of the commercial side of
Adelaide Register, celebrated his 40th year
of association with the paper the other day
by entertaining any of his colleagues who
had been with it for over 25. He got
together nearly 50, the veteran of the party
being Henry Hele, who entered the office 59
years back.

“Tamworth”: “Rolf Boldrewood’s” death
carries me back to ’BO. I was then assistant
to the squarest-jawed and best printer’s
reader I have met. “Boldrewood” was at
the time supplying the copy for “Robbery
Under Arms,” and he was one of a trio A/ho
were the despair of compositors, and for
whose copy they were paid one and a half.
Dailey and Windeyer were the other two.
Dailey’s was a generous splurge, but mostly
undecipherable. Windeyer made as many
pothooks as there were letters in a word.
His judgment in divorce suits made me cry
and the reader curse. “Boldrewood’s” was
a thin Wangle like a daily-paper war map,
and about s.s intelligible.

“Wealsman”: Recent Bulletin mention
of “Wairarapa” Hornsby and his numerous
newspaper troubles reminds that the Maori-
land political battler’s late dad Avas rather
an adept at sticking his pen into expensive
subjects, Under the pen-name “The. Yet”
Hornsby, senior, who was formerly a Tas-
manian policeman, wrote a series of yarns
entitled “Old-Time Records” for Launceston
Daily Telegraph about 20 years ago. Cap-
tain John Strachan, Pacific Islands trader,
etc., of whom nobody in Tas. had heard for
decades, suddenly blew down from Singapore,
'or Batavia, or the Carolines, or somewhere,
and collected £2OOO from the D.T. for one of
“The Vet’s” most harmless-looking essays..
The author was having the stories published
in book form, and the whole edition Avas
ready, (all but the covers) for issue when the
cyclone struck the show. The edition was
rushed off to Salisbury’s Foundry and cre-
mated in a hurry, and an undoubted best
seller ended in smoke.

Perth’s new press club was opened the
other night to the accompaniment of much
hurrah. From small beginnings in an out-
of-the-way cellar the club has grown in 12
months into a second-floor affair with carpets
on the. floor and curtains to the windows,
and billiard, reading, writing and card
rooms adjacent. Also there is a tabernacle
where the plate is carried round —but it usu-
ally has glasses on it. The present member-
ship is about 150, and includes pressmen
past, present and prospective, and a sprink-
ling of doctors, lawyers, artists, university
professors and politicians. A few civil ser-
vants and bankers and one undertaker are
waiting to come in. The show is run by a
committee- of pressmen with H. C. Reid
(Hansard) as president. Jim Smith (cable
editor of the West Australian) secretary,
and Harry Davies treasurer and financier.

A Northern Vic. linotype has just beaten
its own record. The editor was laying him-
self out to do something extra over a local
wedding, Avhen inanimate object got to
work in this deplorable fashion :
The who Avas given away by her father,
wore a handsome 'gown of ivory duchess satin, with
corsage and drapings of Brussels lace. The car in
which the bride was motored was decorated with flags
of all nations, and a pig which had evidently had its
leg broken while being brought in pink and white
streamers to the sale yards on Monday, was handed
over by the owner to the auctioneer, who immediately
put it up for sale, the proceeds to be handed to the
Belgian Relief Fund. The sale realised £2 10s.
THE CENSOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Censor sits behind his desk,
And smiles a censored smile;
His great, blue pencil hovers o’er
Some masterpiece awhile,
Then swoops —oh, child of whose poor ravished brain?
Coldly another innocent is slain!
The Censor is a murderer.
None knows his secret lair,
Nor all the dark and awful deeds
He does in ambush there.
No eye has seen his charnel-house —it’s floor
With literary corpses littered o'er.
The Censor is a crocodile.
Beneath that slimy flood,
The Waters of Oblivion,
He seeks his livelihood.
His gloating eye marks children of my pen ;
He draws them under from the sight of men.
The Censor is a nibbling mouse.
The fair cheese of my mind
He rifles till there’s nothing left
But atmosphere and rind.
That fair, round cheese, formed lovingly by me,
From milk of thought and curds of poesy.
The Censor is an elephant.
With large, ungainly feet
He dances on the glad, green fields
I sowed in toil and heat,
Till all the fairest flow’rs of thought are slain,
And only unasthetic weeds remain.
The Censor is the Fiend of Storms.
Upon the Inky Sea,
In fear, my poor, frail craft I launch;
Then, with unholy glee,
He makes the winds tear howling through the
shrouds,
And sends fork’d death and shipwreck from the
clouds.
The Censor is a sorcerer.
Above rare fruits that grow
Upon the tree of genius
His wand waves to and fro.
Hey, Presto! And their lusciousness is slain—
Apples of Sodom, Dead Sea Fruit remain.
The Censor is a hooded snake
That lurks within the grass,
And rears to sink his poison-fangs
In heedless babes that pass—-
Rear children of my brain; wee, tender things,
That sink and swoon and perish when he stings.
And still he is a gentleman;
■This much I will admit.
In “Correspondence Columns” he
Seeks not to air his wit ;
On shrinking backs he lays no caustic stripe,
Nor stoops to call our Masterpieces “tripe” !

HOW A “BEARDED LADY” KILLED
ALL HER SUPERFLUOUS HAIR
BY DISSOLVING OUT ROOTS AND ALL.
FOR THE BENEFIT OF SYDNEY “ BULLETIN ” READERS LADY EXPLAINS HOW SHE ACCIDENTALLY
DISCOVERED A NEW ABSORPTION PROCESS WRICH PERMANENTLY REMOVED HER HAIRY MASK
AFTER ELECTRICITY, TWEEZERS, CAUSTIC PASTES, LOTIONS, POWDERS, AND ALL OTHER
DEPILATORIES AND ADVERTISED REMEDIES HAD ABSOLUTELY FAILED TO DO ANYTHING BUT HARM.
By following simple directions given below, any woman now has the means of easily preparing and
using in her own home this wonderful process, which has hitherto been a carefully guarded secret
known only to a few high-priced specialists. Full directions are now made public for the first time.
All who are afflicted with superfluous hair will be
interested to learn of the amazing discovery made
bv Miss Kathrvn B. Firmin, who until recently was
deeply humiliated by these repulsive growths upon
her face, neck and arms. As the hair constantly
became more thick and hideous she tried every pro-
cess and remedy advertised or recommended, but
of being readily absorbed by the hair so that it
creeps down to the root, dissolving as it goes, just
as oil creeps up a lamp-wick. It is perhaps needless
to caution any : who may use this process, which has
so deadly an effect upon the hair, that it must
never by any chance be permitted to touch hair
found to her sorrow that
if any of these removed
hair at all the effects were
only temporary, and new
growths soon appeared
stronger than ever. Even
hours of torture under
the cruel electric needle
simply meant great pain,
a sore and blemished
skin, and the inevitable
disappointment. After
spending huge sums in
efforts to get rid of her
terrible and beauty-de-
stroying affliction, Miss
Firmin was about to give
up tin despair when by
chahce she learned of a
means by whi eh the
beauties of Ancient
Rome are said to have
permanently banished
superfluous hair. With
only a very slight clue as
to the nature of this re-
markable process used
in bygone ages, Miss
Firmin tells how she set
to work experimenting
in hdr tireless effort to
wrest the lost secret
from the past. From
the. _ accounts of Miss
Firmin’s discovery, which
have 1 recently aroused so
much interest among
women with superfluous hair, there seems to be
no doubt that at last there has been found
a way, most radically different from anything
hitherto known, by which any woman can now rid
herself permanently, harmlessly and painlessly of
all superfluous hair growths by dissolving them out
of existence, root and all. One part of the process
consists of a solution, easily obtained and prepared
by anyone, which possesses the remarkable quality
mm
After bearing for ten years the affliction of a humili-
ating and revulsive hairy mash, with beard and mous-
tache like adman’s, Miss Firmin permanently removed
it all in a single night by means of the marvellous
new absorption process explained in this article.
which is not to be de-
stroyed. In explaining the
process Miss Firmin men-
tions that it is perfectly
neutral and ineffective
to the skin, as anyone
can quickly prove by
experiment, but she dis-
claims all responsibility
for permanent loss of
desirable hair, such as
eyebrows, hair of the
head, eta., to which
the process is applied.
Even . though the acci-
dental application be
insufficient to dissolve
the hair at once, it will
eventually die and fall
out, and there exists no
known means of restor-
ing life to hair roots thus
affected.
For the benefit of any
readers who may 'be inter-
ested and who wish to
be rid of their super-
fluous hair by this re-
markable process, we are
authorised to announce
that Miss Firmin has
agreed to send all neces-
sary particulars regard-
ing its preparation and
use to any reader suffici-
ently interested to send
her two penny stamps
for 'return postage. . Simply address Miss Kathryn
B. Firmin (Suite 631 N-), 133 Oxford Street, London,
W., Eng., and full information will be sent by
return post in plain sealed envelope. On account
of the great demands upon Miss Firmin’s time she
has stipulated that this offer must be announced
to positively expire at the end of eight weeks. There
is, of. course, no interruption to the regular mail
service on account of the war.

Dandruff Fell Out in Shower, Scalp
Hot and Itchy. Would Wake Out
of Sleep With Itching. Used Cu-
ticura Soap and Ointment. Free
From Trouble.
Amphitheatre, Victoria.—“ After an at-
tack of influenza about six years ago, my
hair used to come out in handfuls and was
kA
TV
i? G,SA
dry and scurfy. If I shook it
the dandruff used to fall out
iin a shower. The scalp got
very hot and itchy. I used
to rub in olive oil at night,
but the hot itching got worse
and at night I would wake
out of my sleep with the itch-
ing of my scalp. I had only
to touch my hair and it
•would come out in strands, perhaps a dozen
hairs at a time.
“A friend gave me a little Cuticura Oint-
ment and after I applied it the itching
seemed a bit better and the scalp not so
dry. After using one tin of Cuticura Oint-
ment the itching had ceased and the hair
was not falling out nearly so much. So I
continued using Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Ointment and within two months the new
hair began to appear and grew rapidly and
it is now forty-six inches long and beauti-
fully glossy and I feel I am now completely
free from all my old trouble.” (Signed)
Miss Marie Agnes Mangan, Jan., 1914.
Samples Free by Post
r Cuticura Soap and Ointment do so much
for poor complexions, red, rough hands, and
dry, thin and falling hair, and cost so little,
that it is almost criminal not to use them.
Sold everywhere. Sample of each mailed
free, with 32-p. book on the skin and scalp.

A Noted
Hair Specialist.
There is a clever young English scientist, Margaret
Windeyer, practising her profession of hair and skin
specialist in Sydney, who is going to cause a stir
in this sunny land of ours by the extraordinary things
that she is doing for the hair. She practises what is
known as the Thorl system of hair culture, under
which falling hair, even if it is coming out in hand-
fuls, as it often does, is stopped within a week or so,
and made firm in the scalp. The dandruff germ is
entirely cleared away so that it cannot return.
Thin, weak, short, broken, decayed hair is made to
spring into life and grow thick, long, strong and
beautiful. It is worthy of note, too, that this re-
markable system of hair culture has the power of
growing thick, healthy, firm hair upon scalps that
have been bald and bare of hair for many years.
The most amazing feature about it is that it entirely
cures grey hair, that is, it brings the natural
original color back to the greyest, whitest hair,
irrespective of whether the hair has been grey since
one waS' in one’s teens, or whether it is absolutely
all grey, or half or three-parts grey, or just going
grey. To have the lost color brought back to one’s
grey hair so that never again in the coming years
of one’s life can a single thread go grey, to be cured
of our baldness, falling hair, dandruff, etc., to have
our hair given such a start that it’ll just go on
growing thicker and longer year after year without
a bit of bother, worry or expense—that seems to us
to be the kind of relief that is worth seeking and
obtaining with all speed. Nearly the whole of the
first floor of the Bank of N.S.W;, 228 Pitt Street
(opposite Palace Theatre), has been taken for this
young Englishwoman’s laboratories, consulting rooms,
etc., and it is pleasing to know that consultations
with her are free. There are private separate and
exclusive waiting-rooms for men folk and for women.
Country dwellers who send a few combings to Miss
Windeyer to be examined under the microscope will
be written to, free of charge, explaining what is
wrong with their hair and the cost of complete per-
manent cure. Her address: Margaret Windeyer, Hair
and Skin Specialist, Bank of N.S.W. (first floor), 228
Pitt Street, Sydney.*

By “ Kat-ar-ah" Treatment
the Hose and Throat are
treated effectively with

branes.
# * Kat'aV'ah ** Treatment
has a direct influence upon
the catarrhal poisons of
the body and conquers the
disease by removing the
cause ,
Are You a Victim of
CATARRH!
You know what Catarrh is, with its humiliating and discomfort-
ing symptoms.
A slight cold develops into a stubborn and protracted one, while
the discharges from the nose are most offensive and annoying.
As the inflammation extends further up into the head and the
delicate mechanism of the ear is attacked, there is a continual
buzzing and ringing in the ears, and frequently the hearing is
partially or totally lost. Headaches are almost constant, with
sometimes acute pains in the eyes, and the nose becomes so
plugged up that the patient must breathe through the mouth,
while the slimy secretions are forced back into the throat,
requiring almost continual hawking and spitting to dislodge them.
At certain stages of the disease the odor of the breath becomes
very bad, to the mortification and embarrassment of the sufferers,
and the disgust of all who come near them. Gradually the
mucous discharge finds its way into the internal organs, and a
most miserable form of Dyspepsia, or Catarrh.of the Stomach, is
the inevitable consequence. The blood becomes contaminated by
catarrhal poisons and unhealthy matter, and these are
distributed through-the body. ...
Catarrh is then a deep-seated, dangerous, constitutional or
systemic disease, and its effect upon the general health and
system is soon apparent —appetite and strength are gone, weight
is lost, despondency takes the place of confidence, and the disease
frequently settles in some vital organ or terminates in Bronchitis,
Asthma, Neuritis, or dread Consumption.
Trial Bottle of
“Kat-ar-ah” Inhalant
FREE.
I want all who are afflicted with Catarrh to try a sample bottle of “Kat-
ar-ah ” Inhalant at my expense. It is a synthetic compound of certain
valuable medicaments, and is supremely beneficial in its influence on the
mucous membrane. It has a distinctly soothing, healing and sero-sanative
effect, sufficient todisintegrate and dislodge the slimy mucous accumulations.
“Kat-ar-ah” is first aid to Catarrh sufferers. Its healing effects are
simply marvellous. You can notice an improvement immediately after
beginning its use. It quickly takes up its work of killing the disease
germs, of minimising and eventually stopping the discomforting mucous
discharges in the nose and throat —mucous that is finding its way into
your stomach and poisoning your system.
I will supply you with a Trial Bottle of “Kat-ar-ah ” Inhalant FREE OF
CHARGE, if you will send me your full name and address, together with
3d. in stamps to cover cost of postage. Write address plainly, state
whether Mr., Mrs., or Miss, and be sure to mention this paper. Send
for vour bottle NOW.

Knibbs, the- Commonwealth Statistician,
has been pointing out that: landlords are fre-
quently liars, and give information that
rents are rising when they are really fall-
ing. Knibbs may think he has discovered a
practice which is brand new, but he hasn’t.
Every landlord has either said or suggested
it since the first cave-man put up, the notice
“To Let.” on the rock shelter out of which
he had just clubbed the red-haired woman who
had recently been made a widow. The prin-
cipal difference between this case and any
others is that if they try the dodge on with
the Commonwealth Statistician, landlords
are liable to a fine of £5O, whereas with
others they have a chance of squeezing out
an extra sixpence a week.
An Oddfellows’ lodge at Perth has taken
olf its coat and erected a house for a widow
in a single day. The frantic haste calls for
explanation. Even a widow will usually
keep till to-morrow.
“Karri”: Re fruit cases (P*. IS/2/T5).
The lately opened Westralian State saw-
mills have succeeded in lowering the price
in that patch. Cases for local use that were
7d. last year are now 4d., and export cases
that were 9d. are now 6|d. In addition, the
boxes are standardised and more evenly cut.
Next year the mills will probably export to
Victoria and S. Aus.. if the prices in those
places keep up. The whole of this year's
supply has been cut out of the waste from
the Trans-Australia sleepers. You cannot
make a primary industry out of fruit cases;
it is essentially a waste-wood proposition.
That is why co-operation can do little to
lower the price. When cocky’s co-operative
sawmill is erected it would pay him better to
put two cuts in the log and make a sleeper
than a dozen and make a fruit-case. And
then if he made fruit-cases out of what
wouldn’t do for the sleeper, he would be
starting right into the saw-milling business,
and there he must pit himself against a con-
crete trench full of armor-plated sharks.
* * * *
Evidently there is money in it if it is
managed properly. Melbourne’s most notori-
ous demi-monde, who died lately, left an
estate which has been proved at over £BOOO.
There was one tragic touch in the document
the much-soiled lady left behind her: she
made small bequests to an orphanage, a
foundling hospital and an infants’ home.
“Gordon G.”: This man’s ad., now
appearing in Victorian papers, is frank,
anyhow:—
Blank Blank, the Renowned Scientist and Healer,
invites anyone, no matter how obstinate their com-
plaint, to call on him, and if he can cure you he
will tell you so. If not, he will tell you just the
same.
* * *' ■ *
“J.G.”: After being, as I believed, rooked
over four consignments of first-grade apples
sent to four different Melbourne fruit agents,
I shepherded the next lot personally. 1 saw
them sold for ss. Gd. a case, and heard the
buyer told that if he took the cases away
they would be Sd. extra. A cheque turned
up in a week, accompanied by a statement
showing that the apples realised 3s. Gd. No
mention was made of the cases. Cartage (a
quarter mile) was charged at the rate of 4d.
per case; the Railway had carried the con-
signment 30 miles for 2d. a case. I’ll do
the rascal the justice of saying that as soon
as he saw my hand he disgorged.
* * * #
“P.W.” : Since Drought gripped the land
the native-born have little reason to crow
about the Murray. The stream above Went-
worth is at present but a miserable string of
waterholes, wherein the cod must lie low
with the minnow lest he become stranded
or broiled. You can’t have a much worse
reflection on the river than this: that, in
order to catch the “fresh” in the wool
market, Lake Victoria station has been load-
ing its clip on to camels, which have been
padding along beside the river bed to Mil-
dura. where the bales are tipped into trucks
and dragged to port that way.
“SCIENTIFIC” WILLIE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Willie’s fed the cows and pigs, the horses and
the chooks,
He’s off to school —four miles or so —with fourteen
pounds of books ;
He learns the phases of the moon, the meaning of
such words
As psychopath and dithyramb, while full a dozen
birds
He calls by name. Day after day he practises with
vim
Some new kind of brain-movement his preceptor
teaches him.
He learns to reckon, read and sew, saw, draw and
sing and write;
Sometimes he looks (and thereby helps to spoil his
infant sight)
At 50,000,000 cocci through kind teacher’s micro-
scope ;
Or, with his bunch of gdm-boughs, here we have
Australia’s Hope '
Noting the crude conditions under which some larvae
live.
They call it education—the sort a State should give.
Watch Willie, at his nature-study, slowly soaking in
The wisdom of the ages from a tadpole in a tin,
Or poring over something wiggle-waggling to and
fro
In the body of a bottle where beer-bubbles used to
grow.
Why, Willie yet may rise to be Prime Minister,
mayhap,
By sitting through school-sessions with a lizard in
his lap.
It may be so. Still, though Bill start quaint studies
by the score,
Will beetle-knowledge later keep disaster from his
door ?
When his collected butterflies have fallen into dust,
Bill yet may find it difficult to earn a simple crust
To feed himself and little Bills, and keep his missuf
dry
Upon a rude, wild, rainy day arriving bv-and-bve
victoria.

Do Your Meals Fit?
Do you feel snug and comfortable around
your waist=line after a hearty meal?
Did your last meal taste deliciously good
to you, and did you eat all you wanted?
Could you have patted your rotundity in
glee and felt proud of your appetite and
of your good, strong stomach? Do you
feel rosy now because your last meal
gave you no inconvenience whatever? If
not, you have Dyspepsia in some form,
and probably never realised it.
If you have the least trouble in your
stomach after eating, no matter how
little or how much you eat, there is
trouble brewing, and you must correct
It at once.
Most all stomach troubles come from
poor, weak, scanty gastric juice, that
precious liquid which ought to turn your
food into rich, red blood.
If you have Nausea, your gastric juice is
weak. If you have sour risings or belch-
Ings, your food is fermenting; your gas-
tric juice is weak. If you have loss of
appetite, your gastric juice is weak. If
yon have a bloaty feeling of aversion to
food, y'our gastric juice is weak.
Vou need something in your stomach to
supply the gastric juice which is scanty,
and to give power to the weak gastric
juice.
I)r, Sheldon’s Digestive Tubules do this
very thing.
Now, think, one grain of one of the in-
gredients of these wonderful little tab-
ules digests 3000 grains of food. They
are several times more powerful than the
gastric juice in a good, strong, powerful
stomach. They actually digest your food
for you. Besides, they increase the flow
of gastric juice—-just what you need to
get all the good possible out of every-
thing you eat. You will never have that
“lump of lead” in your stomach hor any
other stomach trouble after taking Dr.
Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules. Then every-
thing you eat will be digested; they Will
give you strength, vim, energy and a
rosy dispositon. You’ll feel good all

over.
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules Will

hearty meal. Take one or two after eat-
ing. Y'ou’ll feel fine, then your meals

Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules on your din-

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY son!.... Them words, jist like a
blessed song,
Is si in me ’eart the ’ole day
long.
Over an’ over; while I’m Scared I’ll wake
Out of a dream to find it all a fake.
My son an’ bloomin’ heir. .. .Ours!... .’Ers
an’ mine!
The finest kid in—Aw, the sun don’t shine,
Ther’ ain't no joy fer me beneath the blue,
Fnlest I’m gazin’ lovin’ at them two!
A little while ago it was jist “me,”
A lonely, longin’ streak o’ misery.
Vn’ then ’twas “ ’er an’ me” —Doreen, my
wife!
An’ now it’s “ ’im an’ us,” an’ sich is life.
But, ’struth! ’e is king-pin! The ’ead

1 mustn’t tramp about, or talk no slang;
I mustn’t pinch ’is nose, or make a face,
I mustn’t —Strike! ’E seems to own the

'll knoo the game clean through ; ’c seems
that wise.
W if ’er an’ nurse ’e is the leadin’ man,
An’ poor ole dad’s amongst the “also ran.”
“Goo goo,” ’e ses, an’ curls ’is cunnin’ toes.
Yeh’d be su’prised the leaps o’ things ’e

I’ll swear ’e tumbles I’m ’is father, too.
The way he squints at me, an’ ses, “Goo,

Why! ’s moruin’, "’ere, ’is lordship gits a

Fair on me finger—give it quite a nip!
An’ when I tugs, ’c won’t let go ’is bold !
’Angs on like that! An’ ’im not ten da vs

"Goo. goo,” ’e ses. I’ll swear yeh never did,
I n all yer na telleral, see sich a kid.
The cunnin’ ways Vs got; the knowin’

Tlicr’ ain’t a youngster like ’im anywhere!
An’, when ’e gits a little pain inside.
’ls dead-straight griffin ain’t to be denied.
I’m sent to talk sweet nuffin’s to the fowls;
While nurse turns ’and-springs ev’ry time ’e

But say, I tell yeh straight. ... I been

The things I thort I wouldn’t dare to tell
Best, in the■ fellin’, I might feel again
One little part of all that fear an’ pain.
It come so sudden that I lorst me block.
First, it was ’ell-fer-leather. to the doc.,
Go took it all so calm ’e made me curse—
An’ then I sprints like mad to git the nurse.
By Gum! that woman! But she beat me
flat!
A man’s jist putty in a game like that.
>She owned me ’appy ’ome almost before
She fairly got ’er nose inside me door.
Sweatin’ I was; but cold wif fear inside.
An’ then to think a man could be denied
Is wife an’ ’ome an’ told to fade away
I’.V jist one fat ole nurse ’oo’s in ’is pay !
I was too weak wif funk to start an’ rouse.
Struth! Ain’t a man the boss in ’is own
’ouse?
“You go an’ chase yerself!” she tips me
straight.
“Tlier’s nothin’ now fer you to do but—
wait.”
IV ait ?.... Gawd.... I never knoo wot
waitin’ meant,
In all me life, till that day I was sent
To loaf around, while there inside —Aw,

I couldn’t tell yeh wot that hour was like !
Three times I comes to listen at the door ;
Three times I drags meself away once more;
Arf dead wif fear ; ’arf filled wif tremblin’
, joy
An’ then she beckons me, an’ ses: “A boy !”
A boy !” she ses. “An’ bofe is doin’ well!”
1 drops into a chair, an’-jist ses— “’Hll!”

-Vn' all the room gits sorter blurred an’

She smiles, an’ moves ‘er ’and. “Dear lad!
Kiss ’im.”
Year smothered in a ton of snowy clothes,
I irst thing, I sees a bunch o’ stubby toes,
Bald ead, termater face, an’ two big eyes.
"Look, Kid,” she smiles at me—“ain’t ’e a

L didn’t seem no sorter size to me:
t yet I speak no lie when I agree.

said.
Somewhere, in some ole book, one time I
read,

"Kiss ’im,” she ses. 1 was afraid to take
Too big a mouthful of ’im. fear ’e’d break.

’Ow did ’e ’owl! In 'arf a second more

Scarce knowin’ ’ow, I gits out in the yard,
An’ leans agen the fence an’ thinks reel

A long, long time I looks at my two ’ands,
"They’re all I got,” I thinks; “they're all

’Twixt this ’ard world an’ them I calls my

An’, fer their sakes, I’ll work ’em to the

Them vows an’ things sounds like a lot o’

Maybe, it’s foolish thinkin’ all this stuff.
Maybe it’s childish-like to scheme an’ plan.
But I dunno —it's that way wif a man.
1 only know that kid belongs to me!
We ain’t decided yet wot ’e’s to be.

But I ain’t got much use fer them soft guys.

THE ROMANCE OF LITTLE MR.
TITMARCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ I OMANCE lias really no penchant for
aesthetics,” said Pat Mackaboy,
barman. “Excuse this large lan-
guage, but you, too, are a tale-bearer, and
there is here no occasion to mince words.
Literary persons rarely permit Romance to
associate with bald heads, or knocked knees,
or a painful strabismus, excepting with an
air of great condescension. In point of
fact the old lady doesn’t care what prosaic
company she keeps, and I have found her
on intimate terms with all sorts of odds and
ends of humanity.”
Mackaboy and I were alone in the bar.
It was the morning of a pale day, and
demand was slack. Now and then a torpid,
ill-shaven citizen, all unstrung from last
night’s carnival, came stealing in like a
shamed cat, took a stiff one medicinally, and
strode out again, making a poor imitation
of a man ; but for long intervals there were
no interruptions, and the barman gave affec-
tionate attention to his brasses and glasses.
“There was Titmarch,” said Mackaboy,
"Walter Waverley Titmarch, five foot four,
seven stone and twelve pounds, erect, square-
shouldered, straining his braces to make
the most of nothing much, crackling like the
thorns under a pot, somewhat boyish at 45
in spite of an obvious baldness curiously
veneered with some strata of hair from the
lower slopes, neat as a new piano, harmless,
unattached, but with a breezy, bustling way
with the girls that was not ineffective at
first glance.
“I dubbed him ‘Major.’ The type is
markedly military, but it belongs, too, to
those commissionaires who shoo the dogs
off exposed, softgoods at city emporiums to
auctioneers and brass bandsmen. Not
fancying Walter as a performer on the
bombardon, I made a major of him. and he
was Major Walter Waverley Titmarch
throughout his stay at Cuppy's Family-
Hotel, Binwell.
“Binwell was then one of those unfortu-
nate happenings misnamed a township. It
was on the Gippsland line. It would appear
that a few people who had fallen off the
train had gone to sleep there, and the place
had grown up about them. Binwell had a
station, a church, a blacksmith’s shop, two
stores and a stray dog. The dog was
encouraged because In* always sat on the
platform up against the poster advertising
Bare Bone Corsets, industriously kicking
himself both ways, which helped to convey
an impression to passing travellers that
Binwell was alive in parts.
“For some time after taking up my
duties at Cuppy’s Family Hotel I wondered
what I was doing there, but Binwell was a
township subject to spasms. It had a
scattered population, and on occasions the
items came up from afar fortuitously, and
assembled in Cuppy’s bar. Then the guests
were so animated it took me all I knew in
the absence of modern appliances for lifting
beer to keep pace with the generous public
demand.
“Major Walter Waverley Titmarch came
to Binwell. seeking peace and rural peculi-
arities. Binwell specialised in peace and
quiet and fresh milk daily. I have known
three days of such quiet there that I could
hardly shake off the delusion that I was m.v
own ghost. But Walter seemed to do very
well. He spent most of the morning shav-
ing, holystoning his teeth, applying hair
(Continued on next page.)


Affects the WHole System
No patient can live more than a few hours
when the kidneys cease to act.
For the kidneys are the blood-filters. When
they fail to act the hlood is left in a poisoned
state.
The heart, the lungs, the digestive organs,
the brain and the nervous system all have to
depend upon the blood for their nourishment,
and they cannot be nourished by poisoned blood.
That is why kidney trouble is so serious—
the vital organs are always liable to become
involved.
The earlier symptoms of weak kidneys are:
Patient feels very drowsy, heavy and irritable;
the sight is affected, and there may be headache.
Later, the watery swellings of dropsy appear,
there is pain in the loins and back, or patient
gets rheumatism. Nearly every case is accom-
panied by some disturbance of the urinary
system, such as irregularity in action, gravel or
stone.
The advanced forms of kidney disease are
not curable, but in the earlier stages Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills often prove invaluable.
Many bad cases of dropsy, stone, stoppage
caused by obstruction of the channels, rheuma-
tism and lumbago have been completely cured
by this remedy, and patients have reported
themselves still well many years later. Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills arouse sluggish kidneys
to a natural activity, enabling them to keep the
blood properly filtered, and to throw off the
poisonous uric acid and waste water, which
cause so much mischief when left too long in
the system.

KIDNEY TROUBLE CURED.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
FROM LEICHHARDT. |
Mrs. Emily Osborne, store, 101 Foster Street, Leich-
hardt, Sydney, says:—“Some years ago I had a very
bad attack of disordered kidneys, and. as a result,
suffered agony from backache and rheumatic pains all
over my body. I was often so bad I could hardly get
about the house, every movement giving me increased
pain. My rest at night was very disturbed, as it was
impossible for me to lie in one position for any length
of time, owing to the nagging pain in my back. My
ankles and arms swelled a good deal, and were very
painful if I touched them. I had no energy for any-
thing. and was really far from well. Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills were recommended to me, and after
taking a course of these grand Pills I was completely
cured. It is eight years since 1 was cured, and 1 have
had no return of kidney trouble since.”
Two years later, Mrs. Osborne says“ Ten years
have elapsed since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured me, and I am still well —a fact that speaks
volumes for this splendid remedy.”
FROM BALMAIN. |
Mr. W. B. Lewis, 5 Ballast Point Iload, Balmain,
Sydney, states: —“There is no medicine more satisfac-
tory or really beneficial, that I know of. than
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Much sickness and
broken time would be avoided, especially by those who,
like myself, are occupied at outdoor work, if these
Pills were better known. One of the many advantages
about Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills is that they may
be taken with perfect safety at any time. 1 suffered
from the kidneys for some time, and was recommended
to try them, and they gave me great relief. My
friends, to whom I have spoken of their excellent
effect, speak in similar terms of them. I have no
hesitation in saying that Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are the most comforting and most certain to give
relief of any kidney medicine I have ever tried.”
Eleven years later Mrs. Lewis says:—"My husband
has not suffered with his kidneys since Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills cured him eleven years ago. This
remedy is worth its weight in gold to the kidney
sufferer.”

washes for the resuscitation of the appar-
ently dead, training his creeper over the bald
spaces, powdering his chin, brushing his
clothes, putting new lacquer on his boots,
and spraying scent over all. Then he would
saunter down and have a look at the creek,
then saunter up and have a look at the hill,
then drift across and watch the four-o’clock
train come in. And having carefully in-
spected its departure he would lounge back
into the bar, take a mild drink, and
exchange views about the world in general
with the cynical barman. Walter’s talk of
men and affairs —mostly woman —left the
impression that he had been bred in Geelong,
and had always gone to bed at nine after
leading a wild life. In the evening he was
usually associated with the giggling of the
housemaid in the parlor, or the monotonous
protestations of Miss Cuppy behind the
passion plant on the west verandah.
“Here I beg to introduce Miss Sally
Harding, of the Hardings of Nine Mile Run,
Pigaroot. Sally’s papa, Robert Harding,
Esq., had been known for a generation as
‘Staggering Bob,’ in graceful remembrance
of the quality and character of the meat
with which he preferred to feed his
employees, tie was worth anything up to
half a million, was about the size of a power-
house chimney, and slouched about his vast
possessions in the pants left over by the
last rouseabout, two-thirds of an eighteen-
penny shirt, and a hat cut out of the corner
of a sugar-bag.
“Miss Sally looked it. She was 25, no
doubt, five foot ten in her home-made,
woollen hose, as angular as a lean team of
working bullocks saved from the drought,
dressed in the latest fashion you can recol-
lect, as simple as a teething calf, but with
a certain large, lumbering attractiveness due
to the kindliest brown eyes in the world, a
warm, sensitive mouth, and one bale of
respectable auburn hair true to type, with
all the autumn tints in it.
“I was credibly informed that Sally had
contracted the megrims, or the vapors, or
some similar distemper to which girls in the
bush succumb through looking long on the
cow when it is red, and considering the
limited possibilities of milk and cream for
too protracted a period, and had been sent
up to town for the rest cure and to indulge
in a new outlook on life.
“Consider, will you, the state of mind and
the peculiar habits of those primitive hill
dwellers who regarded Binwell as ‘town.’
and hold it to be a suitable place in which
a pipped sister might refresh her mind and
retrieve her natural gaiety.
“To get down to essentials. Miss Sally
Harding looked on Walter Waverley Tit-
march and gasped. I do not over-state the
case—she gasped, and for an appreciable
space she stood gasping. Never have I seen
it take with such suddenness. Had Cupid
been there with an elephant gun the poor,
soft hippo could not have been brought down
with greater expedition.
“Love at first sight—and such love ! It
almost seemed that the big simpleton was
going to snatch at him. She couldn’t believe
that such a nice, neat, smiling, sweet pack-
age could really be a man. During the first
hour her eyes turned to him continually,
with a sort of wondering unbelief, and when
he spoke to her she trembled through her
ungainly length, and the color surged in
her face in transverse currents.
“Walter responded in kind. Possibly
because there was nothing much doing, pos-
sibly because something in her really
appealed to him. They got together and
they were hard to part. Hand in hand they
looked at the creek. Hand in hand they
visited the hill. They haunted the sapling
groves, and walked the dim vistas. No more
giggles for Minnie the housemaid. No more
tender protestings from Hiss Cuppy. The
cover of the passion plant on the west
verandah was now all for Walter and his
abounding Sally.
“You will have gathered that they didn't
match in the physical aspect. The union of
hearts was all down on one side, so to speak.
He was small from any view-point; beside
Sally Harding he looked like Tiny, and she
—well, can you imagine an overgrown
human creature glowing hot with happiness,
blind to the earth and the stars, finding
immensity filled with one small, jaunty,
prattling manikin?
“She suggested to me a lubberly, soft-
hearted girl with a great well of mother-love
in her, who, all her life, had been deprived
of the beatitude of dolls, and now found
herself suddenly possessed of the most
perfect doll ever designed—a wonderful doll
that brought to her thus late the neglected
doll period, with all its childish raptures,
and blended them with the big emotions of
a woman.
“All Bin well was laughing at her, but I
couldn’t get a grin out of it. Once I came
upon her actually nursing him, holding him
in her lap, pressing his head to her breast,
looking down into his eyes through tears.
It called up quaint recollection of a huge
brown bear I once saw at the zoo, hugging
a mite of a cub, but deep down somewhere
the old woman in me was touched, and 1
felt as sympathetic as a fat aunt.
“Well, the Major’s holiday was up, and
he went back to Melbourne. Sally watched
the train that bore him off, weeping openly.
She watched the curve where the train dis-
appeared for two hours, a bundle of sodden
desolation. During the three remaining
days of her stay she did nothing much but
look down the line towards Melbourne, and
mourn like a large, simple animal utterly
bereft. If yon ever saw a woman elephant
that had lost its kitten, that was her.
“Sally Harding returned to Nine Mile Run
on an ancient American waggon with in-
growing wheels, and in five months I had
ceased to speculate on her case. Recollec-
tion was revived by the arrival of Robert
Harding, junior, and his brother Don. They
were big. raw, ungainly devils, like the old
man. They partook of a sullen meal at
Cuppy’s, and went on to Melbourne without
a word for each other or anyone.
“The two Hardings returned next day.
They had Major Walter Waverley Titmarch
with them, and the Major was spiritually
down to it, and physically out. lie looked
as if he had been torn from his hiding-place
under the bed. and brought away to face an
ignominious end, with the fluff thick upon
him. He was hastily dressed, and pale, and
unshaven; the Virginia creeper that usually
masked his baldness was all awry, and the
fear of a material hell was all over and
about him. The two big Hardings were
ranged on either side of him, like warders or
executioners.
“Walter was in custody. That was plain.
The brothers never spoke to him. but threw
him a snarl now and then that made the
little man’s nerves hum like harp cords.
They allowed him a sort of lunch, sitting
between them, each with a malevolent eye
on the confinee or accused.
“Then came the antique waggoiu and at
this point I gently insinuated myself: ‘Good-
day, Major,’ I said. ‘You are not looking
your best.’
“He turned on me, whiter than before, very
tremulous. ‘For God’s sake, don’t call me
“Major” !' he almost whimpered. ‘l'm not a
major; I’m ledger-keeper at Wilts and
Armond’s in the Lane. 1 never said I was a
major. That was all your doing.’
“ ‘True,’ said I. ‘The merry jape was mine
alone. No harm in it. I hope. If it has got
you into any kind of uneasiness, and you
want a hand out, I’m here to order.’
“Bob Harding put his shoulder in: ‘You'll
please keep your nose out of this,’ he said.
“I continued addressing Titmarch. ‘lf
there's any trifle I can do for you. speak up,
and don’t allow your respect a>r the drome-
dary at my elbow to deter you, because I
have no doubt in the world he could be
reduced to reason in six minutes or so.’
“ ‘No, no, there is nothing,’ stammered
Walter. ‘Really nothing. I am going out to
Hardings on a visit. I’m obliged to you,
Mackaboy, but it’s ouite all right.’
“He went off with them in the American
waggon, and there was an interval of 24
hours between scenes 1 and 2 of Act Two.
Next day at noon, Black, one of a coal-pro-
specting party out at Madcap, brought me a
note. It ran :—-
Dear Mackaboy,—Will you get a trap and coine for
me? I am rather bad. There has been an accident.
I don’t know of anyone but you who might do this
for me. — Walter Titmarch.
“I found him in a settler’s hut, lying on
a bunk in an awful state. The poor little
devil was black and blue, and there was a
broken rib and a dislocated collar-bone.
“He told me the truth before we parted.
The Hardings had carried him to Nine Mile
Run, had married him to Sally in the home-
stead parlor, then taken him out into one of
the paddocks and walloped him.
“Walter Titmarch, carefully bundled in
lint, was sent on to Melbourne, and I re-
mained sweltering in a hate for the amiable
Hardings that interfered with my sleep and
spoilt my digestion. They had inade the
military title a feature of Titmarch’s gross
deception, and part of their grievance. That
dragged me in, and I was itching to assert
myself.
“I had to wait five months. Meanwhile
a son was born to Mrs. Walter Waverley
Titmarch at Nine Mile Run, Pigaroot.
“Bob Harding gave me my opening one
night in Cuppy’s bar. lie was holding just
enough whisky to make a naturally unbear-
able honnd abominable. He said things to
me which were distinctly displeasing, and I
was glad of it.
“Had he continued to fight according to
the usages of polite society I would merely
have busied myself rearranging his face, but
when he had precipitated himself against
seven straight lefts in rapid succession, he
began to use his boots. The all-in game
suited me just as well. In the course of a
long and an occasionally dishonorable career
I have received instruction in quite a number
of nasty tricks for street use. I have learned
the fighting of various lands. I gave Bob
the benefit of one grand device, and in the
fall Hubert butted clean through the front of
Mr. Cuppy’s bar-counter, making so neat a
hole tliat much timber had to be removed
before the head could be withdrawn.
“Naturally Cuppy was angry with me for
incapacitating a good customer, and I left
Binwcll with great satisfaction.

“There follows a wait of close upon seven
years, during which time much water flowed
under the bridge and many things occurred
on top of it. I was walking in a street in
Hawthorn (Melbourne) one sunny after-
noon when a small boy overtook me.
“ ‘Please, sir, mother wants to speak to
you,’ he said.
“I returned about 50 paces to a pleasant
villa in a handsome garden. A big woman,
well-dressed, comfortably plump, with a smil-
ing mouth that invited friendship, and a
bundle of autumn hair —as fine a dame as
you’d care to be bothered with at 40—came
across the lawn, pushing a nice, white hand
towards me.
“ ‘You’re the dear man that nearly killed
my brother Robert, aren’t you?’ she said.
“Of course, it was Sally. While we shook
hands Walter Waverley Titmarch Came down
from the verandah, boyish still at 52, nine
stone now, erect, square, straining his braces
to make the most of sft. 4in., crackling, neat
as a new piano.
“They made a soothing fuss of me. ‘You
know,’ said Titmarch, ‘it's well with us now.
This is our boy. There are twins inside, and
my little wife and I seem to think the world
a nice place for a holiday, Mackaboy.’
“He said ‘little’ wife, mark you, bolding
on to as much of her arm as he could reach.
“It had all come about in this way. On
the evening of the second anniversary of his
wedding day, Titmarch. who lived with his
mother in a cottage in Richmond, received a
visitor, a big woman of 27, carrying a child.
For a moment he sat, staring at her, pale
and apprehensive.
“ ‘Wally,’ she said, ‘aren’t you glad to see
me? lam your wife. This is our son. My
father is dead. I am a rich woman, and I
am free, and have come to tell you that,
through all. there has been nothing in my
heart for you but love and great thankful-
ness. I was a big sloth of a creature, and
I owe it to you that I became a living, loving
woman. I want to say how I have sorrowed
over the cowardly, brutal things they did to
you, and to tell you that half of all I have
is yours, freely, gratefully.’
“But Walter would not hear of it. ‘Not
half,’ he said. ‘All! all!’
“And he had his way. ‘He’s such a master-
ful man,’ said Sally.”
