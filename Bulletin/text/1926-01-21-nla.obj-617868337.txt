When you “can’t sleep”
Sleepless nights are often caused by a dis-

found that sound and restful sleep is
induced by the use of ENO, which corrects
the sluggish and imperfect action of the
eliminative organs. When troubled with
sleeplessness, you will find ENO a friend
indeed.

What’s Wrong with Britain?
In Declension the “Gentleman with a
Duster” (Mills and Boon) does his best to
penetrate the colossal and incredible stupidity
which prevents great masses of people in the
Old Land from recognising the “extreme
vulnerability” of Britain’s position and the
preeariousness of the economic conditions
under which it maintains its considerable
population. “Neither the Government nor
organised Labor,” he maintains, “appears
to be conscious of our main danger—bank-
ruptcy as the penalty of defeat in the over-
seas market.”
The writer’s fundamental argument is that
Britain provides itself with only one-fifth of
its vital food necessities. “Without the four-
fifths from foreign countries Britain would
starve. “We have sacrificed our agriculture
to our industries, and the more our population
has increased the more hardly have we
pressed upon the farmer, until at the present
time his position is little better than that
of ,a man living on the dole.” Obviously a
nation which cannot feed itself is in great
peril of destruction. An accident, such as
war, might reduce it in a week or two to a
state of starvation.
But the foreigner does not send these food-
stuffs for love and affection. They must
be paid for in manufactured goods, and if
British goods fail in quality or quantity, or
if their price becomes too high for the
foreigner’s pocket, then Britain’s supplies
of food fall off, its trade is paralysed and it
must live in the shadow of famine till the
end comes. All this should be obvious to
an infant. Yet the Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer loads the manufacturer with taxes,
local authorities crush him with rates, and
Labor leaders act in such a way that they kill
any chance the British employer may have
of successfully meeting any form of foreign
competition:—
Three years after the Armistice, three years of
insensate strikes and the wildest revolutionary propa-
ganda, the great trade of England was suddenly
snapped like a rotten twig. Four millions of people
were flung out of employment. Spiders spin their
webs on the machinery-of Sheffield and Newcastle,
and birds build their nests in the roofs of the foun-
dries of Middlesborough. But for the support of
the banks some of the greatest firms in England
would have had to wind up their affairs and some
of the proudest municipalities in our industrial
North to have declared themselves insolvent. To
meet, these difficulties the statesmen of England,
making no effort to reduce their own extravagant
expenditure, loaded the manufacturer with still heavier
rates and taxes and directed all their energies, not
to the' assistance of British foreign trade, but to the
doping of the unemployed with a dole for idleness.
From that moment the German had no
doubt of his ultimate victory. The one rival
he had to fear in the markets of the world
was clearly without the intelligence of a
child. “Let our foreign rivals defeat us
still further in the overseas markets of the
world, and our supplies of food will fail, the
cost of living will increase, and the hungry
millions of this country will demand a revolu-
tion that must destroy us all.”
The “signs of unsoundness” noted by the
“Gentleman with a Duster” commence with
the obvious decay and disappearance, of the
old “cultivated” classes in England. The
urbanised democracy cut off from intimacy
with the old territorial families has no defini-
tion in its mind for a gentleman or a lady.
It divides the nation into Kieh and Poor.
Let the most contemptible boor stumble into
a fortune and he becomes in the eyes of
democracy a gentleman. Let a member of
the leisured classes fall to the level of hav-
ing to work with his hands and lie is no
longer a “real gentleman.” Now, the work-
ing classes look to those who have great
possessions for a lead in the art of living;
and what lead do they get? “I am per-
suaded,” he continues, “that the total effect
of the Rich is overwhelmingly on the side
of the Belly. It is not only that they con-
temptuously ignore the whole field of re-
ligion, but they make no bones at all about
treating culture of the mind as au affecta-
tion. It is because of their contempt for
intelligence, which is the most manifest and
dangerous of their disloyalties, that the Rich
are leading the whole nation into the anarchy
of materialism.”
Labor is tending towards economic suicide,
then, chiefly because there is no example in
the nation of intelligence, duty and a moral
aim. It looks up from its dull toil and
sees the Rich behaving as if existence had
no other purpose than the gratification of
animal appetites. It concludes, therefore,
that there are no moral conditions to the
economic life of a nation, and that the only
rational consideration for a grown man is
to have, in the language of the Rich, “a
good time. The flaunting of the luxury of
the “idle rich” by the popular press is a
far greater asset to the agitator than his
own party newspapers.
The political, vanity of the British workman
accounts in no small measure for flic nation’s
industrial misfortunes. The manual toiler be-
lieves all wealth springs from his exertions,
and that capitalists are only parasites prey-
ing on the products of labor. And this
gigantic conceit, has established itself just
at the very time when the highest intelli-
gence is necessary for the guidance of in-
dustry in the proper channels. Here is the
central truth for the worker’s consideration.
No matter what party succeeds into power
in the future the industrialist will still have
to. work for his living. He will still be a
miner or cotton-spinner, a riveter or furnace-
man, a printer or bricklayer. Even if the
Red flag flies from Westminster clock-tower
the factory siren will still call in the early
dawn, and the week-end will still find him
in the position of receiving a wage for his
labor. Nor will his new rulers be able to
increase his wages or lessen his hours of
labor, since the thing he makes must be sold
in competition with the thing made by other
nations, and nations as hungry as himself
He will be just as hard at work as the
manual laborers are in Soviet Russia, and
his wages, as in Bolshevist Russia, will be
screwed down to the lowest point in the
economic interest of the State. Is the Social-
ist politician likely to be more successful
Ilian the present directors of British trade
and commerce in selling the products of the
workmans labor in foreign markets?
The “Gentleman” has little time' for the
tleljjiy* lie Is acquainted, he says, with many
clergymen whose minds are illuminated by
the most beautiful charity, but “clergymen
en bloc and in the mass are as fiercely in-
tolerant as any .Hindu priest, and apparently
as unenlightened concerning the work of
scholarship as a negro missionary in the
United States.” It is the same in Labor
conferences; the intelligent reformer whom
we know and appreciate as an individual is
transformed in the atmosphere of organisa-
tion and political gregafiousness into a
sounding Lenin and a tinkling Trotsky.
“Declension” i.s a model of terse, epigram-
matic writing. It reminds me somewhat of
Masterman’s “Condition of England After
the War,” and arrives broadly at the same
conclusions, stressing, however, the matter of
spiritual values in a way foreign to Master-
man. It is in every way worthy of .perusal
and of re-perusal.

Australasian Verse, Wholesale
No one who has not seen the enormous
mass of verse recorded as having been issued
from the Australasian press can have any idea
how busy the pens of Australia have been
from the earliest years of settlement. On
the task of producing “A Bibliography of
Australasian Poetry and Verse,” now pub-
lished by the Melbourne University Press,
Percival Serle spent three full years of unre-
mitting toil. For that great industry and
the extreme care with which the work has
been done Australians of the future should
be more than grateful. All the little lost
volumes and slender booklets which were
sent out to carry the hopes of aspiring
singers are here faithfully recorded, with
the number of pages and their size accu-
rately given and the dates generally supplied,
even when they were omitted from the title-
page. As far as it is possible to test the
list it is both accurate and comprehensive.
In his preface the compiler of the work
refers to the extreme difficulty of his task.
Many volumes have been published by inex-
perienced authors which were neither adver-
tised nor handled by booksellers. A few
copies may have been sold in odd places or
given to friends; and of these a still smaller
number may have found their way through
a second-hand bookseller into some library.
Of such works—generally without merit—
the compiler does not claim that he has
secured a record of more than 75 per cent.;
but he does claim —and more than 200 closely
packed large pages seem to testify the claim
—that he has found at least 99 per cent, of
the books of verse published which contain
anything with a pretension to literary
quality.' A long list is given of librarians
and others who assisted Mr. Serle in his
work, but of the 2700 volumes and editions
recorded he personally examined 2450. Where
he has not been able to personally examine
a book he gives his authority for its inclu-
sion. The number of authors here shown to
have written verse in Australasia from the
earliest days until June, 1924, is no less
than 1420.
The work is _ made more complete and
valuable by a list, of 350 of the more im-
portant volumes for the guidance of librari-
ans and collectors. Of these more than 100
are marked as worthiest of first choice. Here
again the selection is excellent, though there
might be a difference of opinion about some
of those indicated as the worthiest. It is
very difficult, for instance, to see why
Bracken’s “Mu,sings in Maoriland” should be
purchased before R. J. Cassidy’s “The Land
of the Starry Cross,” or why Francis
Adams's “Songs of the Armies of the Night”
should get a hearing before Hugh McC-rae’s
■ Columbine.” These, however, are merely
differences of opinion ; and it may be that
Mr. Serle has felt it necessary to give more
prominence to older work which had a repu-
tation at the time of publication.
Another valuable list records the names of
those whose work has appeard in various an-
thologies of Australasian verse but-who have
never issued a volume of their own work.’
When it is noted that among those thus
mentioned are Randolph Bedford, Montague
(xrover, Ernest O’Ferrall, Patrick Quinn,
Dulcie Dearner, Clarice Crosbie, M. C. Keane
and Annie Colborne Veel, it is easily seen
that some such list is needed to complete the
compilation. If it had been possible to add
a third appendix, showing the names of
those who have been frequent and popular
contributors to newspapers but who have
appeared neither in anthologies nor in sep-
arate publications, it might have opened up
some mines of valuable verse to the future
delver into the beginnings of our Australian
poetry.
But life is short, and Mr. Serle has already
given three good and full years to the making
of this large and comprehensive bibliography.
That he had a. double object in undertaking
such a vast amount of work is interesting
to note. The volume is intended as the
first instalment of a history of Australasian
poetry which the compiler hopes eventually
to complete. He has also a new anthology of
Australian and Maoriland verse which will
shortly be published in London by Wm.
Collins and Sons. If Mr. Serle’s judgment
and selection compare at all favorably with
the painstaking care he has shown in the
making of the present volume, his anthology
should be very well worth while.

Virtues and Vices
Whether or not a human quality is
accounted a virtue or a vice, a strength or a
weakness, very often depends upon the use
it is put to and the result it achieves. We
are taught as children that curiosity and
vanity and discontent are, if not actually
vices, at. least weaknesses that we must
fight . against, and, if possible, overcome.
And if, when we grow up, we know a no-
body who is curious and vain and discon-
tented, we point these qualities out as his
weaknesses and vices, and in a great many
cases put his failure down to them. But if
a man succeeds and is accepted as a some-
body,. these qualities, if he possesses them,
are given new names and pointed out as his
virtues and causes of success. If curiosity,

vanity, discontent drive a man on to do
what his fellow-men want done, **$7 are h.s
virtues; but if they cause him to do what
his fellow-men do not want done, tl y -
accounted vices or weaknesses that he should
try with all his might to overcome.
Take curiosity. It is never
but the desire to find out trivial thiiw,
greatly important things, on the chance ot
gaining in some form or otlici the ‘ .
that our instincts tell us is somewher
at some time granted for all knowledge. I
it takes very different forms. One man
braves hardships and fevers exploring some
forgotten city of the ancient world. He tries
to find out what sort of people vveie those
who lived in it, and what sort of lives they
lived. He probes, if he can, right into the
intimate stories of their lives. His woi -
accounted praiseworthy, and we call him an
archaeologist. Another man places his <
to a crack in the fence the better to over-
hear a quarrel between Ins neighbors. He
wants to find out what sort of people they
are and what sort of lives they lead. His
curiosity is a disturbing element and a
menace to the privacy of all our lives , and
we call him a Paul Pry. So to the church-
man the curiosity of the sceptic who searches
into and undermines the churchman s be-
liefs is a vice. But the curiosity of the
sceptic who searched into and undermined
the beliefs of the churchman's ancestors, and
found behind the fires and stars and fetiches
worshipped by those ancestors the clinic i-
man’s Cod —that curiosity is a virtue. Any
curiosity that is directed away from us and
is likely to make us more secure and com-
fortable in the world is a virtue; but the
curiosity that is directed at us or threatens
in any way our comfort and security is a
vice. . T
It is much the same with vanity. "We are
taught that we should do what we think is
right, regardless of what other people think
of us, and that what we are taught is right.
We even sometimes reach a stage ot sell-
deceit when we believe that we do not care
what people think of us. But the majority
of us, at any rate, do care. It is a man s
physical desires that drive lum on to live,
but it is more than anything else his vanit.v,
his hope of winning the approval ot ms fel-
low-men, and his fear of gaining then
disapproval, that directs him through
social life, as the stars are . directed
through the heavens. This vanity is, ir not
actually stronger, at least certainly more
lasting in most men than any of the great
passions. It is the framer of. all the great
conventional laws. And it is these laws
more than anything else, certainly tar more
than a country’s churches or gaols, that
guide, control, discipline the vast majoritv
of men and women and thus make possible
a more or less orderly advance of the human
race. Nelson wrote that he desired glory
more than anything else in the world, las-
teur frequently mentioned his longing tor
fame. And whence could glory and fame come
to them but from their approving fellow-
men f But if a fop makes himself absurd
seeking the approval of his fellow-men, his
fellow-men laugh. His obvious vanity shows
his obvious weakness. It is a vice. 11 a man
succeeds, the vanity that drove him on to
success is a virtue, but if he tails, the vanitj
that drove him to his failure is a vice.
Bo with discontent. The man who becomes
the real leader of men is the man whose
desires, mental and physical, are strongest
and fiercest, and who is, consequently,
most discontented. The man who con-
forms to what he believes to be his
duty, and suppresses and overcomes hn
desires so that he may the better conform,
is willed by the community or by his belief,
and the giver to him of that belief.. He
passes as the strong-willed man. He is cer
tainly the conventional hero. But if he were
more discontented, his discontent, would not
allow him to conform either to his given be-
lief or to the communal idea of duty. Then
he would will where he is now willed.
He would not be a conventional hero,
perhaps, but he might be of more real
service as a leader of mankind than
as he now is. merely one whom man-
kind leads. The discontented man might
never achieve as much in this. world as
the more contented man. He might be only
a good-for-nothing, a loafer; but he will
never be a conformer and an' acceptor. Dis-
content, like curiosity, and vanity, in the un-
successful is a vice, in the successful a vir-
tue. The servant who works cheerfully and
faithfully we call a good servant and a tine
type of man because he best serves ns or
members of our kind. And we look with
disapproval upon the discontented servant,
because we see in his discontent a disturbing
element, and something likely to threaten
our mastery over him. In the servant dis-
content is a blameworthy thing, and ulti-
mately becomes a vice. But if that servant
ever becomes a master, the vice that drove
him on to liis mastership becomes pride and
ambition, and ultimately quite a high virtue.
In a recent Red Page article a writer dis-
cussed the conceit of srenius. Possibly if the
inner being of a man of genius could .be
analysed his three predominating qualities
would be revealed as curiosity, vanity and
discontent —curiosity to call him on, vanity
to control and direct his advance, discontent
to provide his motiving power.

Anthologists and Ornithologists
A. H. Chisholm (R.P. 10/12/’25) seems
to threaten us with still another anthology,
this time of local bird-verse, on English
and American models, As an ornithologist
I am keenly sensitive to the claims of our
matchless native birds for a more deserving
place in our literature, but I want them
sung far more for the sake of our literature
itself. We should all dearly love to see at
hand the material for a good anthology of
Australian bird-verse, but anyone who knows
the whole ground well must agree reluctantly
that the material is not yet there.
I am one of those optimistic Australians
who have been following closely for many
years every literary movement here, and
“watching out” for each new writer of verse
as he or she came along. Our creative writ-
ers have been my preoccupation ever since
I escaped from the standard classics of old
schooldays, and as a nature-lover I have 1
been more than ordinarily interested in the
slow development of our nature verse. I
could afford, therefore, to suffer gladly A. H.
Chisholm who. as soon as birds were men-
tioned. rushed in with the airy assumption
that this “one J.M.D.,” forsooth, “dogma-
tises without particular knowledge,” and
“does not know what has been done. 1
know rather thoroughly all that has been
done, though 1 am intrigued to note that my
friend has discovered a “recent versifier who
has outdone all the rest.” . 9
A. H. Chisholm’s trouble is that he is con-
cerned with rhymes and versifiers while my
subject was Australian nature poetry. Hav-
ing narrowed the whole subject down to
birds only, he practically repeats me in an-
nouncing' that “several versifiers have ren-
dered homage to the magpie in quite worthy
rhymes.” Just so; but who wants the
totally unnecessary infliction of an anthology
of versifiers? A. H. Chisholm could search
industriously, and copy out every Australian
writer who mentions a bird. He could
just as easily get together an an-
thology of wool-verse or sports-yerse;
or there are the stringybark and the
rouseabout. An Australian bird anthology
is a much desired book, but it belongs to
the future. Some of Bernard O Dowdys
woodnotes wild and J. Le Gay Brereton s
“Silver Gull” will have a place. William
Blocksidge’s kookaburra poem from .‘More-
ton Miles,” and Mary Hannay Foott/s Be-
lated Swallow” will be there. R. H. Long
must be represented, and “Bell-birds be
culled from Kendall, in spite of its strangely
erroneous ornithology. But the amazing fact
remains that the desired anthology of the
future will contain not a single line of Adam
Lindsay Gordon, nor of Barcroft Boake, nor
of William Gay; nothing of James Brunton
Stephens or George Essex Evans; scarcely
a line of Henry Lawson or Victor Daley, or
of a dozen more of our greater poets, unless
some callow compiler be content with
a few fragments torn from texts in the
hope that they might be considered suitable
enough. . , . ,
It was certainly worth noting that such
Australian poets as these simply were not
attracted to the subject, and no immature
dogmatising can alter the fact. Mary L.
Wilkinson made a collection of 80 or OU
“Nature Poems” from Australian sources,
and even of these not half a dozen deal
with birds. Bertram Stevens’s “Golden
Treasury of Australian Verse” contains
twice the number of poems; and how many
are bird-poems? Perhaps two or three. Ihe
rest of the bird-verses were excluded.
It is no use blaming or scolding the poets,
who must follow their own inspiration ; but
one might well inquire why so little real
poetry has been written about our birds, and
how it was that the bush bored Brunton
Stephens stiff, to use his own expression.
Whatever may be the explanation, most ot
orr poets have cared no more for (he Gery-
aonc albigularis than for the cassowary.
A. H. Chisholm would have to exclude
almost all our representative singers from
his alleged anthology, but he offers a naive
little list of his own. with a truly amazing
ending: “ and (if you please) Bernard
O’Dowd and Hugh McCrae. (These last
two. be it noted, are somewhat patchy as
to Australian wood-notes, and one does not
yearn to be lost in the bush m their com-
pany ) ” Since he has elected to write on
this' subject, surely Mr. Chisholm cannot
be ignorant of the significance and value oi
these very two writers? I shall never forget
the first impression made upon me by
o’Dowd‘s “The Bush” —surely the finest
piece of work ever done on the subject, and
one of the few genuinely great sustained
poems of this country. It was the long-
delayed guerdon of the little army of opti-
mists who were watching and waiting We
are all heartily sick of mediocre anthologies;
but if we must have still another it is de-
voutly to be hoped that the superabundance
of cheap- jack wares always at hand will not
mean the exclusion of what small amount of
really good stuff we have The would-be
bird anthologist who would hardly admit
Bernard O’Dowd and' Hugh McCrae to the
company of Dennis and Souter and H. o.
Legge should be kindly advised to stick to
“pursuing politicians in print, or whatever
his right job is.
JAMES DEANEY.
The Exile of Erin
“C.0.M.” has the last word
The substantial agreement of “J.E.” with the main
points of my plain statement of the origin of Robert
Burns and his genius makes it unnecessary to contest
his minor objections. It is quite true that Robe
did not try to shoot the landlord, but it is equally
true that he dispatched a small brass cannon to the
French revolutionaries at the time when the expedi-
tion of Hoche was preparing to bring assistance to
Ireland. Even his Scotch biographers admit that
significant gift in aid of a lost cause. But one of
my chief complaints about “J.E.” is his amazing
faith in his dictionary of national biography. 1
have alwavs found it an advantage in referring to
a compilation of this kind to have some idea of
the particular nation referred to. suc ‘*
an idea one may turn to, say, Smith’s Classical
Dictionary”- and be shocked and pained to discover
that it contains no reference to Henry VIII., Darwin
or Woodrow Wilson, and that even the. name ot
Elijah Dowie had been omitted. The Irish nation
is not the British nation; and it is by no means
surprising to find that in a British dictionary- of
national biography the greatest Irish names have
been entirely left out, as well as the greatest Spanish,
German and French names. That some Irish names
are to be found in the British dictionary is true;
for Irishmen identified themselves with many lands.
\n Edmund Burke in England is no more remarkable
than a Marshal MacMahon in France or a General
O’Higgins in Chile. ~
But the still more astounding idea, held by J.E.,
that Irishmen are not distinguished in literature
demands a strong protest. Up to the end of the
seventeenth century the Irish language was the
speech of nearly all Ireland, and even at the middle
of the eighteenth century the language was still
spoken almost exclusively by two-thirds of the
island and understood by most of the rest. Seeing
that most of those who did not speak Irish in
Ireland were descended from other nations, it must
be clear that the English-speaking fringe represented
a very small population indeed—probably not more
numerous than the present population of Tasmania.
The real Irish literature is in the Irish language;
and as late as 1730 the great Patrick Raftery of
Mayo had a stronger hold upon the nation than any
British writer in his lifetime has ever had upon
the British people. Yet Raftery was only a small
singer compared with some of earlier centuries. No
comparative standard of greatness is possible; but
if the love and worship of a whole people, number-
ing at the time nearly seven millions, is not a
guarantee of greatness, then w T e may have to come
back to a national dictionary, even if it be compiled
by the editor of Tit Bits or some unknown Scotch-
man, for our list of the really great.
Still, considering the very small number of
English-speaking Irishmen and the relative size of
the Irish nation to the British, it is surely rather
a matter for surprise that Ireland has written so
much and so well in the English tongue. Leaving-
out Robert Burns altogether, the following list of
names of undoubted Irishmen who added something to
English literature should make even “J.E.” reflect:
Swift, Steele, Yeats, Goldsmith, Marlowe, Burke,
Sheridan, William Shakspeare, Oscar Wilde, Bernard
Shaw and Thackeray. These are certainly not names
to be despised.

A Satchel of Books
Lipstick, by Lady Kitty Vincent (John Lane). A
little book with unconventional illustrations. It re-
counts what befell the elderly Countess of Carstairs,
trained under Victorian conventions, when placed in
the midst of the modern fast set, in an atmosphere
of bishops, decollete maids and cigarette smoke.
Has all the sparkle of gooseberry champagne.
Out of the Silence, by Erie Cox (Vidler: Mel-
bourne). A gripping yarn of a lost civilisation dis-
covered by Alan Dundas, a Melbourne lawyer who
has thrown up his practice to go on the land. One
day he discovers, while digging, a subterranean
passage that leads to the heart of a civilisation
buried before Greece arose. A beautiful wonder-
woman is preserved to tell the story of her times.
One Dreamer Who Awakes, by E. Shaw-Cowley
(John Lane). Upon a slender thread of plot the
author strings vivacious and impetuous dialogue
that carries the reader through varying phases ot
life and emotion to find rest in every-day domestic
life. The story—such as the writer has to tell—
is well written, and the character of Christine, the
heroine whose experiences as maid, mistress and wnc
are its central interest, is a skilful study in psycho-
loS 2 %e Golden Fleece, by H. C. Bailey (Methuen).
“Her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden
fleece and many Jasons come in quest of her.
This quotation furnishes the key to a romantic novel
in which the Jacobite heiress, Susan Lovel, numbers
among her suitors the Young Pretender, that very
gallant warrior of the salon and the boudoir. Mr.
Bailey has a long list of historical novels to ms
name, and of the literary delvers in the past tor
the material of romance is one of the most suceesstuJ.
Memoirs of John Mylton, by “Nimrod” (Edwin
Arnold). A reprint, with some beautiful colored
plates, of a rather remarkable biography about an
even more remarkable person, published 90 years
ago. John Mylton was a Shropshire squire who spent
on various madcap freaks, mostly of a sporting and
convivial nature, about half a million pounds— a vast
sum a century ago—in 17 years, and finally died, a
sodden wreck, in a debtots’ prison. 4 Nimrod, a
sporting journalist of the same era, endeavors to
make out the best case possible for his scatter-cash
friend on the plea that all his follies and vices
could not obscure the possession of a good heart
and infinite courage, which, on the evidence pro-,
rented, is indisputable. But it was easier to make
out a case for John Mylton in 1835 than in 1920.

Argonauts of the South , by Frank Hurley

Antarctic voyagings as official photographer
Shack let on and Mawson to the South ole. . ‘ .
no pretence to scientific value, but recounts in Mmple,
a-ranhic nhrases the picturesque sides ot these two
great adventures. Thi story of Mawson’s expedition
has been told and retold; but Hurley sketches his
scenes and characters in broad outline, gJVingtJiern
an interest and a human touch that will appeal t
the general reader. An offer, later, of the P os t ot official
photographer from Shackleton was accepted with
alacrity, and he returned to the unchaited seas of
Antarctica. His descriptions of the color and charm
presented to him dispel any conception of the Fa
South as a study in black and white. He tells ot
the “vastness painted by the sun with scarlet, purp e
and gold, the dawn flushed with pink, magenta ana
lilac the stars which like celestial lamps Ht the
infinite spaces and glittered from crystalline skies.
The letterpress is illustrated by exceptionallj fine
photographs. An attractive record presented in hand-
some form.

described by “S.G.” (B. 24/12/’25) as “the funeral
march of a fried eel.” The poetry of the Revolution
isn’t anv more uplifting. Here is a specimen, thrust
into mv hand by an I.W.W. colporteur on the Yarra
Bank in Melbourne, its title “Restaurant”; its
author Laura Tanne, a prolific poetess of U.S.A.:

Or. M. J. O’Reilly (St. Johns College, Sydney

serve ’the hall-mark “racy of the soil and musically

The future is thine own, loved land;

Exceptidnal Riding Cdmfdrt
1 he riding comfort of a motor-car is not
dependent upon its length, weight or cost,
any more than the comfort of a home
depends upon its size.
If the seats are deep enough and the proper
distance from the floor; if the seat backs
are correctly pitched for relaxation; if the
upholstery is sufficiently stuffed and there
is plenty of leg room; above all, if the
springs are rightly designed and of proper
length, you will have exceptional riding
comfort. Otherwise, you will not.
Dodge Brothers, with characteristic
thoroughness, studied and experimented
with these details for years. Their findings
were ultimately incorporated in the design
of Dodge Brothers Motor Car —without
question now a vehicle that ranks with
the first in this vitally important feature,

City Comforts for Country Homes.
In the country home not served with Electric Current, the lady
m the home deserves equally as much as her partner, the
freedom from drudgery that electricity brings. She needs more time to
devote to her children, to make her more comfortable and beautiful.
Consider the value of Lighting alone.
Good lighting in the farm home and in and around the farm buildings probably contributes more
to the comforts .and happiness of all members of the family than any other single convenience. The
value of sufficient lighting properly located and protected, and instantly available by tipping a switch
can hardty be over-estimated. ’
w . °' l lamps burn the oxygen out of the air, making it not fit to breathe—often cause ill-health
With them there is the ever-present danger of fire. Electric lighting is odorless, consumes no oxygen
and gives the most flexible supply of artificial illumination with the least danger of fire.
Home Light and Power Unit supplies this medium. In addition, it will also

Dust.
I took the dust, the choking dust,
And flung it on our love —
The love we murdered with distrust.
The clouding, blinding, silent dust
It settled like a dove.
I strewed the dust, the dove-grey dust,
Upon the love we killed.^
“No more I need to weep,” I said,
“For Love that stabbed so deep is dead;
And dust has veiled his comely head
And dust his eyes has filled.”
The blurring dust, the softening dust,
The tender dust of years,
Has settled on the love that died
And stanched the bleeding wounds of pride
And dried the scalding tears.
Now I may meet you by and by;
But oh, the dust is thick!
I would not sweep it hence, not I, .
Though Love, the Lord that cannot die,
Beneath his pall be quick.
For fear the dust, the kindly dust,
Might rise up at a touch,
Enfold and choke me where I. stood,
I wait a miracle, a flood
Or tears to cleanse the dust and b100d....
For I was hurt so much.

Like a kingly artist
All the world’s adorning—
What a sight for morning
To look down upon!
Tired of lane and alley,
Tired of eyes where gloom
Ever lurks deep-seated,
Tired of want and sorrow,
Crowded street and pavement,
Sewer, slum and gutter,
This the prayer I utter,
“Give me elbow-room!”
Give me clear horizons,
Cloudless, ample, fair,
Where with stride untrammelled,
And with reach unhampered,
Freely I may wander.
Wine-like air deep-drinking,
Glowing, singing, thinking
Thoughts sublime and rare!
Though the city thralls us,
? Tis a prison still;
Many-celled. w T hore often
Men cry out for freedom,
Craving for the Primal
Life that lay around them
Ere time tamed and bound them,
Bringing toil and ill.
Moted beams are gilding
Narrow ways of gloom;
Arms and shoulders jostling
Through the raucous city
Goes a cheated people.
Hither, thither straying,
Dimly, dumbly praying
For more elbow-room.
lie who walks among them,
Clear of vision sees
Sunburned riders riding.
Whistling in their saddles.
Singing as they canter
Through wide sunlit spaces,
Green and golden places,
Heart and mind at ease.

Witch in the Tree.
When the moon rose ripe and big
And the trees were black as pitch
What you thought was just a twig
I knew surely was the witch —
Pointed hat and buckled sboon
Swinging right across the moon !
Airs went mad among the boughs
Till the whole earth seemed to rock.
’Tis the way that elves carouse
While they wait for twelve o'clock.
Old folk make the foolish wheeze:
“Only wind among the trees!”
Southerly the wind last night
Shrilled a blossom-honeyed gale :
And the soft moon, round and white,
Hoisted an adventurous sail
Till she rolled among the cloud
While the great trees broke and bowed.
I was watching all alone.
Did I for a moment wink?
When I looked the witch was gone!
Only boughs as deep as ink
Swung towards the flying moon—
No red cloak, no buckled slioon !
Does some lighthouse on a crag
Make a steeple of her hat,
Fly her red cloak for a flag
And domesticate her cat?
Is her pearl-pale face adrift
Where the long green rollers lift?
Or did boughs swing her so high
In the blue, so steep, so far
That the cloak she can’t untie
Caught and chained her to a star ?
Somehow I can scarcely think
In God’s walls she found a chink!
When the moon gets up to-night
Like a cap above the trees
Only branches, blossom light,
Will be tossing in the breeze.
Close in, cloud, as black as pitch
Lest my eyes regret my witclC

TORY REACTION IN N. S. WALES.
While they were waiting for Lang’s axe the
old hands of the N.S.W. Leg. Council de-
lightedly snubbed the Government by reject-
ing its rejection of their amendments to the
Parliamentary Electorates and Elections
Bill. Although 25 lawyers, storekeepers,
boot-manufacturers and other wage-plugs
were appointed recently, and Lang assured
the amiable De Chair that he could
rely, oil 20 existing members, pnly 30
Ministerialists were present when the
divisions Were taken. Which suggests that
the head may not drop into the basket as
soon as was anticipated when/the 99 Leg.
Councillors were promised life-passes on all
Australian railways, and the proposal that
Willis and Coates should remain in the
Ministry when they ceased to be members
of the Legislature was tried on the dog.
The Parliamentary Electorates Bill is Colo-
nial Secretary Lazzarini’s special contribu-
tion to the wisdom of the ages. Its one
merit is that it abolishes proportional repre-.
sentation, which, has proved a • costly
failure in N. S. Wales and a swindle in so
far as the electors have been robbed of
their right to choose their representatives
when casual vacancies occur. With that
single exception, the bill is thoroughly bad.
It is the reactionary production, of a re-
actionary Minister which has one object, and
one only—to keep the Labor party in power.
The Government purposes restoring single
seats, wdiich is good, and the first-past-the-
post system, which is putrid. The first-past-
the-post system was abandoned in N. S.
Wales 16 years ago, and there has been no
public demand for its re-introduction, nor
was it mentioned in the policy speech wherein
Lang solemnly declared that “when the
electors vote for Labor candidates they-yote
for what is here proposed, and not for any-
thing else, so far as the existence of the
next Parliament is concerned.” Every other
Labor party in Australia, if not in
the world, lias rejected first-past-the-post.
But the thing admits of a disciplined
minority gaining power and distributing the
fruits thereof in spite of the good old
democratic principle for which even N.S.W.
Labor politicians used to profess reverence,
so it finds favor in the eyes of bogus demo-
crats like Lazzakini. That worthy was so
hard up for arguments in his second-reading
speech that he was reduced to commending
the example of the British Parliament to the
demagogues of the Trades Hall and Mac-
donell House—“the British Parliament has
been elected under no other system,” he said.
(On other occasions he refers to the British
Parliament as the home of a corroding Con-
servatism, the seat where Toryism is throned.)
He also asserted that “there were very few
minority representatives in this Parliament
when the first-past-the-post principle was
in vogue: never more than three.” In reply
it was pointed out that three constituted a
bigger majority than several modern N.S.W.
Governments had enjoyed, his own included.
The Minister declared, further, that third
parties have no right to be on the earth.
Similar views have been. expressed by
Barwell, another reactionary; but toler-
ance was expected of a Labor leader, especi-
ally as Labor was itself a third party not so
very long ago and, judging by its sorry slump
in the Commonwealth Parliament, may be
one again. Nevertheless, the Lazzarinis and
Langs aim at destroying the Country party
by infamously unfair means. Country elec-
tors are to be deprived of their right to cast
contingent votes for that party and are to
have minority representatives thrust on them
if the oracle can be worked. Whereas the
tendency everywhere else is to liberate the
electors from the power of the machines, the
Ma State electors are to be reduced to a
choice between such candidates as the
machines may stamp with their approval
after the selecting body has been packed or
the ballot-box stuffed with fraudulent votes
by means of the sliding panel. That is what
democracy has come to under the Lang
regime in N. S. Wales.
* * * *
Other peculiar provisions were embodied
in the bill. One was to the effect that ballot-
papers not initialled by a rcturning-oflicer,
and hitherto rejected on that account, were
to be regarded as formal. It was explained
that fraud was unlikely since the printers
would use a special kind of paper; but special
kinds of paper have been used in other prin-
teries and conveyed in large quantities to
“comrades” for insertion in Labor ballot-
boxes with sliding panels or otherwise. One
of the Leg. Council’s amendments was that
the check of the returning-officer’s initials
should be retained. Still more peculiar was
the proposal that the electoral boundaries
should be fixed by “three persons holding
some office in the public service of N. S.
Wales.” The Parliamentary Elections Act
of 1919 specified that the boundary commis-
sion appointed in that year should consist of
“a District Court Judge, the Under Secre-
tary of the Chief Secretary’s Depart-
ment and an officer in the Bureau of
Statistics”; and the departure from this
precedent has a sinister aspect con-
sidering the efforts that have been made,
by bribes and intimidation, to Laborise the
public service. Perhaps the idea is to ap-
point defeated Labor candidates now in the
service; there are plenty of them. How-
ever, the Leg. Council has substituted the
1919 clause for the 1925 “improvement.” It
has also inserted a provision for voluntary
preferential voting, but it should have gone
the whole hog and made it compulsory. The
Council’s successful insistence on its amend-
ments does not ensure the defeat of the bill,
but will delay its passage, and delay is im-
portant. It will give time for publie opinion
to harden against an unspeakable measure,
and for opposition to develop among the
large number of Laborites who are opposed
to selection-ballots and all they stand for,
and who will have nothing to do with the
first-past-the-post infamy in their own leagues
or unions.
THE HEATED COMPETITION FOR
“MIGRANTS.”
Canada has evolved a scheme for attracting
the Britisli “migrant,” and, despite his reluct-
ance to separate himself from the unemploy-
ment dole, he is apparently willing to be
attracted, even to a winter climate in which
the temperature itself wears an overcoat
when it goes out of doors —if it didn’t it
would perish miserably. The, project is to
bring settlers from Britain to eastern Canada
for £3, or right across the continent to
western Canada and the Pacific shore for
the same old £3. The difference between the
60s. which the “migrant” will pay and the
actual cost of bringing him along is to be
made 1 up in various ways and fished out of
various pockets, but it is not to be borrowed.
Some little assistance, in land or money or
both, is to be given to the pilgrim on arrival,
but it seems to be taken for granted that
work will be available, and that the essential
is to snare the pilgrim. On this matter the
London Daily Telegraph spoke a few in-
genuous words: —
By the beginning of the New Year two large
schemes will be working—the Australian plan, which
includes loans, and the Canadian plan, which aims
at bridging the Atlantic at nominal cost to the
settler, and eliminates a loan policy. The results
of these experiments in diverse directions will be
watched. with .interest.
Unfortunately the plan . of settling, people
here with the aid .of loan-money isn’t so new
as the London Telegraph appears to think.
The experiment has been watched with in-
terest—in some cases with 7 or 71 per cent,
interest—for years now. When last year's
figures are made available it is expected that
the debt piled up under the heading of private
land repurchased for settlement will stand at
about £80,600,000. Then there is another
loan “asset” of about £60,000,000 represent-
ing money borrowed to cover old immigra-
tion expenses and for other matters too many
and mixed for full enumeration. The States,
or some of them, are entering on a new
loan and “migration” career, the Britisli
Government having agreed to advance a
stack of millions, at reduced interest for a
time and ordinary interest for the rest of
eternity, in consideration of having popula-
tion taken off its hands. Whether this
“settlement” debauch is to be a substitute
for the present one, or whether there will
be duplicate and parallel debauches, is im-
material. The point is that, though the
Canadian idea looks new in some respects, the
Australian one is about a hundred million
pounds old, and disreputable for its years.
* * * *
A section of the local press has made
melancholy noises to the effect that the liber-
ality of Canada’s offer will mop up the
available supply of British “migrants” and
leave Australia desolate. But it shouldn’t.
The United States has to a great extent
closed its door, and the attractiveness of
South Africa doesn’t increase much, chiefly
because the nigger increases a great deal. The
60s. trip half-way round the world may at-
tract a rush of the very poor, but the
“migrant” of a slightly better class might
prefer to keep out of that sort of rush.
There should be abundance of good British
settlers left for this country if inducements
were provided. Unfortunately inducements
are absurdly scarce, except for settlement
in the six overgrown State capitals. The
growth of population by excess of births over
deaths is nothing to complain of. It was
almost exactly 80,000 in 1924. In the same
year the increase by excess of arrivals over
departures was close on 44,000, so it might
have been worse. At even that pace the
Empty North, including the N. Territory,
where the Federal Government has
330,000,000 acres to give away if it could
only get over its miserly habits, might be
colonised in a style that would establish
Australia’s claim to possession. But the
capitals, where the politicians and “uncouth
crooks” sit raising and distributing loans
and providing for their uncouth friends, accu-
mulate more than enough to account for all
the surplus arrivals, and for the cities’ own
natural increase, and for a good deal of the
natural increase of the country districts in
addition. These figures are not so up-to-date
as could be wished, but they are the best
available:—
Increase of Population, April, 1921 (Census),
to December, 1924.
Six State capitals .. .. 327,298
Best of six States .. .. 110,315
And it might be put another way to show
that the movement in the wrong direction is,
on the whole, an increasing one:—
Average Increase of Population per Month.
33 months, 45 months,
Census day 1921 Census day 1921
to end of 1923. to end of 1924.
Six State capitals .. 7106 7273
Rest of six States .. 2419 2451
The Northern Territory lost 270 of its ori-
ginal 3567 inhabitants in the 45 months, so
it didn’t tend to improve the average. All
the State capitals are down in the south of
the Commonwealth, and five of the six are
huddled in the south-east corner. During 3|
years of lavish loan-spending for “settlement”
purposes the 1090 square miles embraced
in the half-dozen hole-and-corner metropolises
beat the other 2,973,491 square miles of the
country in the accumulation of “settlers”
by almost exactly 3 to 1. In the last year,
when some good results should have begun
to show for all this effort, city congestion
was found increasing its lead. Until the
mystery is cleared up and a remedy discovered
it might be better to suspend every vestige of
an immigration policy, and let Canada have
John Bull’s surplus if it feels inclined.
* * * *
Australia can’t emulate Canada, however
much inclined, in the way of bringing out
immigrants and shooting them across the
continent, so that they may select lend en
route. There is no railway across the con-
tinent, and for 14 years the Federal Govern-
ment, which owns the land as well as the
railway route, has torpidly refused to sell.
There is no long list of rising industrial
towns and growing seaports to beguile the
new settler with the glamor of future un-
earned increment. Australia’s small towns
tend to be less industrial, partly through the
manipulation of Government railway rates,
and most of them languish, and new seaports
are discouraged. Money is hard to find for
new enterprises, for State enterprises absorb
a great deal, and a great deal is wanted to
help pay for the record pile of imports which
so largely displace local products. A better
tariff would help, but there is always the
carking fear lest it might assist the “capital-
ist,” otherwise the man who organises em-
ployment and finds wages—an individual to
be discouraged at all hazards, according to
the local revolutionists. In this respect a
leprous variety of “patriotism” has arisen
and spread exceedingly. It was regarded as
a notable victory when industrial troubles
closed the Darwin meatworks, also when a
mob took possession of the great Mount Mor-
gan mine, which then took fire mysteriously
and went out of action. Yet the capitalist
wasn’t making a profit out of either of these.
The frequent and purposeless holding up of
vessels belonging to the Commonwealth ship-
ping line, a socialistic institution winch gives
the best pay and the best conditions known
on all the seas, was hailed as h veritable
triumph. But a feat which filled a section
of the nation with absolutely sinful pride
was the effort (partially successful) to stop
the export of Australian goods in general, so
that many products might rot and others
might miss the market. There was almost
a prospect that the country might get rid
of two leading industrial hooligans, both non-
Australians yet professional stoppers of Aus-
tralian industry, but the effort failed for
the time. Thereupon some educated Austra-
lians gave way to untrammelled joy because
the arrogant foreigners had got the better
of their countrymen, and there was an actual
fear lest they might be. moved to light bonfires
in the city streets. The stoppage of work
at Mort’s Dock, Sydney, was also hailed in
various quarters as a mark of progress. So
one way and another, the Commonwealth has
at present little of an attractive nature to
offer to “migrants” or to its own people,
either, though there are a good many rough
loan-money jobs about. In other words.
Australia isn't dressed to receive visitors.
THE TRUTH ABOUT DEMOCRACY.
When democracy became the cry of the
nations of Western Europe and the conti-
nent of America, the enthusiasts for the
rights of man had only a thin knowledge of
the history of their race. The theory that
all men are born equal and free had a plea-
sant sound; and even up to the present
moment most people in most lands are glad
to think that it is true. Yet there is an im-
portant sense in which it is not true; and
its constant repetition as a formula has a
tendency to blind the world to the facts. Few
who have given thought to the question are
not prepared to believe that there are races
in the world incapable of effectively govern-
ing themselves. In that belief Britain holds
India and France a large slice of Northern
Africa; in the Philippines the United States
hesitates to throw off the burden of govern-
ment through a doubt as to the safety and
well-being of the people if left to the control
of native leaders. Every mandated territory
is, indeed, a declaration that certain peoples
are unfit to guide their own destinies. Yet
in European lands the faith in democracy
stands, albeit some of the operations and
results of the system are weird and wonder-
ful. The more intelligent natives of India,
Algeria, Syria and other countries now under
strange rule are surely superior to the poor-
est types in Britain and France; yet the
votes of those poorest types may turn an elec-
tion and so hold the actual governing power,
while the best types in Syria, Algeria and
India have practically no voice in affairs at
all. If the best British minds are so superior
to the Indian average that the big: Asiatic
country must be governed by Britain, why
should the best British minds in Britain
be swamped by the other minds in Britain
which are inferior to those of people in the
countries Britain rules without asking for
popular consent? In seeking an answer to
that question the whole idea of democracy
has to be reviewed without regard for for-
mulae and catchwords. If democracy rests
on a false assumption the sooner we modify
it the better. Nothing is inure dangerous
than to cling to a meaningless formula which
is not giving results. JK
* * * : 1 *
It is generally accepted that democracy
was tried in Athens and Rome, and worked
well until it -was overthrown by treachery or
folly. Nothing of the kind even approaches
truth. When Athens tried a system slightly
resembling modern democracy, the franchise
was not given to more than a tenth of the
people. The workers of Attica —even its
schoolmasters and police—were slaves and
possessed no political rights at all. The
voting power in Rome was equally restricted.
Residents of the city far above the rank of
slaves were without say in any public matter
even in the allegedly freest times. The slave
basis of Europe must be taken into account
in every consideration of earlier political
experiments. The greater part of the con-
tinent—including the British Islands —was
at some time occupied by comparatively
feeble races. Sometimes the feebleness was
in mental grasp ; sometimes there was a lack
of stability and moral organisation; some-
times the weakness, was merely in arms. Over
the whole from age to age swept various
tides of conquest, and the original owners
of the soil became slaves or serfs to the vic-
tors. Occasionally the conquerors were fool-
ish tyrants grinding the faces of the con-
quered; more often they were kindly enough
masters, valuing their human property for
the service it could render. Doomsday Book
shows that slaves formed 75 per cent, of the
population of portions of the West of Eng-
land in 1066. It is true that in some dis-
tricts—notably East Anglia—there were at
that time no slaves at all; but the Normans
soon made good the lack. Ireland swarmed
with slaves as late as the end of the twelfth
century; so did Spain, the Balkans and the
lands along the Rhine and Danube, while
the mass of the people of Russia were serfs
in the days of our grandfathers. The primi-
tive German and Scandinavian tribes had
few slaves in their earlier savage days, but
they were not far advanced in civilisa-
tion before they acquired them; and a
modified serfdom remained the rule among
them up to a comparatively late date. What
modern statecraft, therefore, has to consider
is not the beginnings of system and political
order among the few freemen of Europe,
but the plain and rather unpalatable fact
that our systems have to be made suitable
for the descendants of slaves. In any Euro-
pean land the great majority have come
through long descent from generation after
generation born in servitude. The period
during which their families have enjoyed
freedom is perhaps only a moment by com-
parison with the long time in which they
were the property of masters. Certainly
that old slavery took on all sorts of shapes.
But there was one feature which marked it
in all its forms. The slave had at no time
any political rights. So modern democratic
theory is not a claim that freemen shall
have full exercise of their most ancient fran-
chise, but that descendants of comparatively
recently emancipated slaves shall exercise the
functions which their fathers never exercised
at any time.
*. * * *
Deihocracy has for the time at least broken
down in the three countries where slaves
were once most numerous and most diversi-
fied in race. Spain, Italy and Greece are
all now under despotisms, called from old
Roman custom dictatorships. That two of
the States named are fairly satisfied and
apparently gaining in prosperity under
despotic rule seems to suggest that the people
of those lands have come to profoundly dis-
trust their own democracy. In British
lands, as well as in most of the coun-
tries of northern Europe, there is still
faith in the ballot-box; yet the signs are
plentiful enough that democracy is not
proving the great human success its early
advocates hoped it would be. A large
percentage of the votes recorded at every


popular election are without meaning, and
because there is a widespread feeling
political basis is false, polices haw falien
almost into contempt. lhe idea that a
political leader should appeal to intellect is
becoming lost. The plain truth appears to
he that there are people no more fit to inic
in lands like Britain, France and Australia
than are the peoples of lands like Imb a and
Algeria. Yet this does not necessarily throw
the theory of democracy to the ground. What
is needed is a plan by which those who aie
fitted to rule may be allowed to do so un-
hampered by those who are unfitted. ihe
old plan devised for achieving this was a
property qualification for electors. It was
argued that those who had property had in
the handling of their own affairs learned the
lessons which should make them act as
intelligent citizens at the ballot-box; but
such an arrangement ran against the gram
of democracy. It was obvious that many
without property qualifications would be
intelligent voters, that some with such
qualifications were not intelligent voters, and
that the tendency of politics on such a basis
was to protect the rights of the owners of
property as against those of masses of the
people who had failed to acquire property.
Gradually the franchise has been broadened
to its utmost limit, with the result that
ihe intelligent voter must carry the dead-
weight of the votes which mean nothing, or
even on occasion be swamped by them. In
such matters there is no going back, lhe
democratic idea must advance if it is to
remain at all; and the only possible advance
is by making an electoral qualification which
is in full accord with all the ideals of demo-
cracy. Only thus can the real voice of the
democracy be heard.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Bruce-Pages Meet Parliament.
In old Israel the only way to distinguish
between a true prophet and a false one
was to wait and see how things turned out,
though the luckless king who bet on the
wrong prophet usually got it in the neck
just the same. The same waiting method
applies to the Brttce-Page Federal political
programme. Much of it will be very good if
carried out with an ingenious attention to
detail and with speed and energy. But
there is too much lack of detail so far, and
the speech with which Parliament opened
didn’t sound energetic. A prominent place
was naturally given to the putting down of
the chronic Communist insurrection, and this
was said, with no undue emphasis: —
My Government will submit to you proposals for-
bidding the establishment of associations having foi
their object the forcible disturbance or overthrow
of constitutional government, and providing for the
punishment of persons promoting the objects of such
associations. To prevent the dislocation of tiade
and commerce, which inflicts loss and suffering on
the whole community, legislation will be submitted
dealing with unjustifiable interference with the
transport of goods and passengers.
It is good in its way, yet there is a sense
of something lacking. And there is a lack of
allusion to Federal apparatus for enforcing
the Federal law. If trust is to be put m
State police and State District Court Judges,
both selected by and removable by State
Ministers who are very removable themselves,
and if reliance is to be placed on the hold-
ing capacity of State gaols, results are likely
to be poor. A similar atmosphere of in-
sufficiency enshrouds the proposals for pro-
moting industrial peace,”. and. adapting the
system of industrial arbitration to the re-
quirements of the present day. There may
be a vigorous purpose behind the gentle
phrases, but it is a polite Ministry and slow
to wrath. Speaking of the arbitration tri-
bunal, it is set forth : —
A measure will be submitted to invest the court
with judicial power, to diminish the conflicts be-
tween Federal and State awards, to give members of
organisations registered under the Act control ot
their own affairs and of their officers, and generally
to increase the efficiency of the machinery for the
speedy and effective settlement of inter-State incius-
trial disputes.
It is a fine aspiration, hut it will require a
great deal of living up to. There should
be no difficulty in giving the Arbitration
Court the power of fine and imprisonment
for offences against the industrial law, also
the right to deal with the brawling and con-
temptuous lawyer, and with the. litigant or
non-professional advocate who virtually bids
the tribunal depart to a permanent summer
climate. And then events may happen, pro-
vided there is Federal strength, as already
suggested, to collect the fine and enforce
the imprisonment; and provided there isnt
room for unlimited appeals, financed by
levies which are recoverable from unionists
under pain of excommunication. As for the
promise to give registered unions control
over their officers and over their affairs
generallv, that is assumed on all hands;
to mean that a ballot of members will
be required before violent proceedings are
initiated. The idea is full of promise pro-
vided tbe ballot is bonest, likewise tlie ballot-
box, and provided there is no tampering with
tbe result by uncouth crooks afterwards, and
assuming that some strong and independent
party, like Mr. Brtjce, is present to prevent
coercion and violence in the polling booth,
and taking for granted that sopae force is
hanging round to prevent a minority vvith
sticks and bottles rushing the majority into
a strike after all. But even all this doesn t
provide for the fact that the most hostile
union of all is unregistered, and seems to
get on all right in that condition.

Counting the War Cost.
It is still impossible to assess exactly the
toll the Great War made upon the people of
Australia; the effects may extend beyond
even the generation which is following that
of the men who fought. Children who were
born in the years of excitement and over-
strain are bound to show; some .marks,
although the good conditions of life in Aus-
tralia will modify them. As far as the
soldiers themselves are. concerned, figures
now ready for presentation to the. Common-
wealth Parliament indicate plainly that
nothing like a correct estimate of the wastage
was made when the war ended. During
the year to June 30 last 2037 ex-soldiers
who had been granted pensions died, and
15.258 new pensions were granted, in most
cases owing to the development o f some dis-
tinct disability admitted to be due to war
service, although that origin may have been
denied previously by the Repatriation
authorities. There have been 20,000 recorded
deaths of ex-soldiers since the armistice,
and as it is only through notification coming
to the Repatriation Department in respect
of an ex-soldier drawing a pension that any
record can be kept, there probably have been
very many deaths of which the. Department
has no knowledge, at least a percentage of
them due to war effects : the Department in
the early days declined the pension applica-
tions of many men who, in a spirit of inde-
pendence, refused to apply again, how-
ever much they suffered. The post-war
20,000 lifts the tally of the A.I.F. dead to
79,000; and 70,000 ex-soldiers are receiving
pensions—the number has certainly increased
rather than diminished since June 30 last.
At least some of the deaths and a good deal
of the disability now costing the Common-
wealth money for pensions might have been
avoided had the Repatriation Department
taken a kindlier view in the early years,
when it made its crude distinctions between
disabilities that resulted from war service
and those alleged to have had a pre-war
origin. And although the old attitude has
had considerable amendment there still are
men who, because of their war experiences,
are very poor or erratic wage-earners, yet
who, showing no outward disability, receive
very inadequate pensions; and their com-
plete recovery is made less probable because
of their indifferent conditions of life. In
such, cases, where they have dependants,
their children are likely to suffer as a result
of the circumstances in which they are forced
to live. The souudest policy in the treatment
of the ex-soldiers who are still showing the
damages of war is generosity, not only m
the fulfilment of war-time pledges, but be-
cause it is in the interests of the Common-
wealth to see that the war results are
checked as far as possible from extending
into the new generation.

The Stupid Slave Notion.
Every economist knows that excessively long
hours of labor are more of a curse than a
blessing to any industry in any country.
Every economist knows that up to a cer-
tain stage a reduction of working hours is
not inconsistent with an actual increase in
the day’s output. The whole thing has
been investigated exhaustively in vari-
ous countries during and since the Big
Bloodshed, and the most expedient working
day for civilised artisans has been found to
lie somewhere between ten and eight hours
a day, the prescription varying with the char-
acter of the industry and the general level
of intelligence required on the part .of the
workers. Possibly there are industries and
occupations in which a still shorter working
day would give satisfactory results, but it
has not been proved that they exist in Aus-
tralia. Indeed the significant thing about
the present situation is that there has been
no attempt on the part of the Labor party
to prove anything beyond the fact that in-
creases of pay and reductions of hours are
good electioneering bait in a country whose
workers have been taught to call themselves
wage-slaves. The attitude of Parliamentary
Labor towards the consequences of such in-
novations as that recently engineered in
N. S. Wales is one of bland indifference. If
industry and commerce survive the ex-
periment, well and good; a further dose
can be applied. If not, the comrades
of the Communist wing will be much
gratified at the consummation of their
hopes. There has not even been any
appeal to the beneficiaries to justify the
shortening of hours by giving a bit better
service during the hours that remain. The
idea of such an appeal, perhaps, would seem
irresistibly comic to the gentlemen at the
Trades Hall. But it is not so ludicrous to the
great majority of the workers whom they are
supposed to serve. The average Australian
is neither dishonest nor a loafer yet, though
if he is told often enough by those whom lie
employs to govern him that he is a slave, and
that his master is his natural enemy in the
class struggle, he may get that way. In
the United States, where the slave notion
and the class war are left to the I.W.W. and
the I.W.W. is left to the hoboes and unem-
ployables, wages in the manufacturing indus-
tries are high and getting steadily higher
in relation to the cost of living as the pros-
perity of the country increases, despite—or
because of—-the fact that piece-work is the
rule. In Australia wages and living costs
play peek-a-boo, and the worker gets no
forwarder. Evidently there is something to
be said, after all, for the principle of a fan-
day’s work for a fair day’s wage, and the
fact that the Labor party in Australia is
unable to say it looks by no means promising.

Provinces With a Pull—and Others.
Transit problems a. .. associated problems
of a perplexing sort fill a space in the Bruoe-
Page programme. The Cabinet, thought-
fully casting its weather eye to leeward, is soliu
on a uniform gauge, and it quotes its Lvyogie-
Brisbane railway as a “first, instalment
thereof. This work, to which the Federal
Government contributes largely at the cost
of Australia in general, is expected to be a
solid benefit for two. rich States with a
“pull,” and is a fine sample of voluntary gener-
osity. It will supply , a duplicate line be-
tween Sydney and Brisbane; indeed, there
will be a triplicate line part of the way.
Then it is proposed to build two more scraps
of the South-to-North railway—Katherine
River to Daly Waters, in the north and the
Alice Springs section in the south. I his is
said to be by way of “carrying out thc ™'
gation of the Commonwealth. But the Com
monwealth’s legal obligation, now lo years
old, is to build the whole line, and not hesi-
tating scraps, and its moral obligation, ot
the same age, is to develop the Territory
which belongs to all Australia witii the
mouey of all Australia, in preference
to doing State jobs. Despite the pas-
sion for a uniform gauge, it . appears
that the Federal Department is going
to build some more of the old o|tt.
contraption on its own estate. Another
transport item is the promise that a bill
will be introduced to deal with disabilities
affecting the passenger traffic between las-
mania tuid the mainland. What the par-
tially-ruined isle waiits is something tore-
move completely (not merely deal witn j
the disabilities affecting its passenger and
freight traffic with the mainland, and also with
Maoriland and the world in general, and not
only one that will do a little good during
the tourist season, but one that will work all
the year round. Permanent suspension, of
the Navigation Act might prove the thing.
It is characteristic of the policy of greasing
the fat hog that Westralia, which lost no-
thing and gained a great railway by I edera-
tion, is to get a first payment (or at least a
payment) of £150,000. Tasmania’s losses
have been glaring and obvious, and it is
promised a belated inquiry into its case.
In this connection, also, is the promise of
"measures providing for the government and
development of North Australia.” The dull-
est member of the Cabinet has a complicated
scheme for cutting the Northern Territory
in two, borrowing bits of Queensland and
Westralia as additions to the top bit, and
sending up three or more expensive and
powerless hacks called “commissioners to
moon about on this patchwork freak. As
a substitute for straight railway communica-
tion and an offer of cheap or gratis farms
for settlers, the idea is worthy of the dullest
member.

Melbourne’s Hidden Art Treasures.
“M.G.S.”: From the house of Robert Scott,
London, comes a handsomely illustrated
brochure, “Six French Artists of the Nine-
teenth Century,” by Frank Gibson, the
masters dealt with being Delacroix, Corot,
Millet, Caztn, Rousseau and Puvis de
Chavannes. A publisher's note gives the
reason for the book. Owing to the munifi-
cence of Sir Joseph Dureen, the Tate Gal-
lery is to have a wing devoted to modern
foreign paintings, for which another magnate
is to provide the cash, and the publication
is intended to educate the public to under-
stand the pictures when they come.. This
putting the cart before the horse is m sur-
prising contrast to the habit of Australian
galleries, particularly Melbourne’s. Victoria s
National Gallery has had a fairy godmother,
too, in the shape of Alfred I elton, who
made a fortune out of potions and presented
some £210,000 of it to the people of the
State for the purposes of art. So Mel-
bourne’s art centre is more richly endowed than
any of her sisters’. The money, on the whole,
has been well spent. So well spent, in fact,
that Melbourne’s collection ranks high above
that of anv other State, and will bear com-
parison with many of the lesser galleries of
Europe. There is no assemblage of any im-
portance in Europe that does not have on sale
an excellently-printed introduction to the trea-
sures —some of them very doubtful treasures,
too —which it contains. The books are a
source of revenue, an advertisement and a
valuable medium for educating the Philis-
tines to appreciate the fine flower of the
nation’s life. I have a large collection which
is an endless source of pleasure and instruc-
tion. Although the trustees of the Melbourne
Gallery have splashed on one single picture
£31,395, on another £IO,OOO, and on another
no bigger than this page £5750, all they offer
by way of memento to the visitor is a miser-
able catalogue with the sort of photographic
blocks one expects in the sales-list of a haber-
dasher. If one of the very fine art-printers
of Australia had the making of a catalogue
worthy of the importance of the State s pos-
sessions, he could make a worthy show.
Among the specimens he would chose would,
doubtless, be “Les Jaloux,” by "Watteau,
Bonington’s “The Waggon; the celebrated
Hoppner portrait of a lady; the Miss
Theophila Palmer” of Sir Joshua Rey-
nolds ; the rectangular “L’Hiver” of 1 uvis
de Chavannes; the dashing seascape of
Claude Monet ; a George Mokland and a
Gazin; the Gainsborough portrait of an
officer; the bronze babes of Rodin; the well-
painted but pretentious Van Dyk portrait
that cost £17.800; the sinewy Birdwood of
Sir William Orpen ; one of the exquisite
little drawings of that poet of black-and-
white, llonore Daumier ; Corot’s glorious
“Bent Tree”; Canaletto's faithful archi-
tecture and the dexterous draughtsmanship
of Ingres. Turner, Ruysdael, the two
brothers Maris, Rotiienstein and John
Sell Cotman, enfant terrible of the Nor-
wich school, are also available. It is an
assemblage that would do any publication
proud. Sydney’s collection by comparison
has all the intellectual elevation of an army-
contractor’s drawing-room. I say nothing
of the Australians. With the exception of a
badly-hung specimen or so, the authorities
have seen fit to pack them up and stow them
underground pending building extensions,
which, I understand, are mooted.
Bacon, Guaranteed by Pork, and Further
Endorsed by Hogg.
The cheery loan madness which goes before
a fall, and which is intended in Red quarters
to go before a revolution and the destruction
of our self-governing institutions, is rather
brightening up than otherwise. Late last
year the embargo on new Dominion loans
was lifted in London, after the Ageuts-
General had besieged John Bull s door till
the step showed signs of wear with the fric-
tion of six coat-tails. What they said dun h,
those strenuous days is unknown, but the gist
of it may have been as follows: —
You doubtless know as well as we do that we pay
the interest" on our old British loans now in whole
or great part, by raising new British loans. Of course,
when we borrow ten millions in gold value from
London we spend a corresponding amount of our
paper on works in Australia, and pretend they arc
reproductive; and that keeps up the farce that we
are raising the wind in pursuit of a sound and
progressive development policy. You would be
astonished if you saw some of these works—lunatic
asvlums and the like. The position is that if you
lend us this money, and the next money, and all the
subsequent money, it won’t leave your country. You
will get it back as interest. That is to sav you
will get our IOU, carrying interest, for the interest,
and it Will be all right if you keep lending us
monev to cover the interest. The IOU a better
than' nothing, and events may take a providential
turn to make the document better than it looks.
Should vou stop further credit, you will hace no
more money than you have now, and you will be
minus the fresh IOU, and the chance of events taking
a providential turn will be off.
It may have been remarks like those which
the Agents-General made; but, anyhow, the
ban was taken off. Promptly Oast Novem-
ber, in fact) Westralia?borrowed £2,oUU,<JOO
(roughly £0 17s. per inhabitant), and i Ro-
mania £600,000 ( something under £6 per
head), and Queensland £2,500,000 (aboutid
each), and S. Australia £1,800,000 (say
£3 7s. per human), all in the Bullmarket.
These sums were borrowed for the states by
the Commonwealth, so that it backs their
bills, and they back one another s bills, and
Bacon guarantees Pork, and they are Dotn
supported by Hogu, whom they also support.
N. 8. Wales stands out: of this mutual loan
arrangement, and is like Kicking s cat.
which walked alone. By standing out it
avoids the obligation to provide a sinking
fund, which is the small redeeming feature or
the Bacon-Pork-Hogg combination. IN. fe.
Wales is going to London for a trine ot
£11,250,000 (something approaching ±o per
head), though it will probably go by instal-
ments apd not all in one rush. In addition
to these happenings, all in Britain and all
crowded into four or live months, there have
been over-the-counter borrowings, and Sav-
ings Bank borrowings, and the Federal Gov-
ernment is raising locally "the relatively
small sum of £5,100,000,” as its bland adver-
tisement puts the case. This is to be divided
among Victoria, S. Australia, Tasmania and
Queensland, and is another case of Bacon
guaranteeing Pork, and both endorsing and
being endorsed by Hogg. The loans are for
many and diverse purposes. For instance,
£2.000,000 of Lang’s little bit is for the elec-
trification of railways, the steamification of
which is still unpaid for. These transactions
don’t prove that the big financiers of Lug-
land believe any longer in this country s sol-
vency, while the embargo which was put op
Dominion loans, and reluctantly taken pH,
might be read as a hint that the Bull Gov-
ernment doesn't believe. But there are en-
during reasons why the big loan still floats,
and may do so for a while yet: —
The floaters and their vast mass of agents or sub-
floaters risk the least possible amount of their own
money, and if possible they risk none. Their aim is
to sell out in large or small lots to large or ijmall
investors, and having sold out to keep out.
The commissions amount to much money and the
bigger the loans the more there is for the boss
floater or underwriter and his jackals. Their idea
of the proper size of a loan is naturally that it should
be as large as the gentle public can and will absorb.
Meanwhile the Australian shows many signs
of demoralisation. He mistakes the increase
of debt for native wealth. He is persuaded
that 40 hours’ work per week, or perhaps 30,
is sufficient in a land of such boundless re-
sources—that is. mistaking the loan as a
native resource, the same as wheat, only that
it grows without seed. His delusion makes
him difficult to get on with while the loan
wealth lasts. When it stops he may be im-
possible to get on with.

Lazzarini Sees the Light.
In Tiie Bulletin’s village there is a by-
law that says you mustn't drive your motor-
car after dark without lights if you don t
want to be fined. A' few months ago the
motoring party climbed into power in the
council; and just then somebody got the
police to enforce the by-law against some of
the motorists. Asa protest against this the
motorists recently held a meeting and re-
solved that on a day next week they would
all drive without lights through the most
crowded streets. The threat has been suc-
cessful. The local council has got the 'local
J. Hop to say that the by-law isn't much ot
a by-law anyway, that lie never did care
about enforcing it, and that in future any-
one who wants to do any motor-driving with-
out lights can do so with impunity. As the
Labor Daily justly remarked, this shows
the absolute contempt for the law and the
rights of the community shown by the rich,
who go trampling with steel-sliod hoofs upon
the features of the poor. At least, that is
about what the Labor Daily would have
said if the thing had happened, which, of
course, it didn’t. Capital, as represented
by the motorist, is reasonably law-abiding.
Labor, so far as it is represented by Lang
and Lazzarini, isn't; lienee, as soon as cer-
tain Trades and Labor Council delegates de-
cided to defy the law and sell I.W.W. litera-
ture in the Sydney Domain. Lazzarini dis-
covered that the law couldn t touch them,
despite the fact that there have been more
than 30 prosecutions on precisely this charge
since I azzarini has been Chief Secretary.
The Trades Council theory is that the I.W.W.
is a "working class” institution, and, there-
fore, it must be defended and upheld by the
Gabor organisations of Australia. It is an
institution that has frequently been found
preaching battle, murder and sudden death
as the best means of freeing the wage-slaves
of their chains, and under Lazzarini s
ruling such preaching is now under police
protection. So long us it is unuccompumcu

The Quick-change Artist.
The craving to break something, especially
the law and the peace and their pledged
word and any Australian industry which
may be handy, amounts to a disease in some
quarters. Thus recent developments in the
shipping trade were something like this.
Ijnion officials promised, several months ago.
that job-control of ships would be absolutely
abandoned. It being pointed out to them
recently that 47 hold-ups had taken place
since the worthless promise was made, they
replied to the general effect that “in some
cases the unions had no power to enforce
certain conditions upon individual members,
who would probably disregard such instruc-
tions if they were inclined to do so.” Almost
before they had finished this whine the same
union officials bailed up the crew of the
Suva for failing to pay a levy for the sup-
port of the British seamen who were beguiled
into a strike here against the positive orders
of their own union. There was no nonsense
this time about the unions having “no
power to enforce conditions,” or about “indi-
dividual members” deciding for themselves.
The Suva men had to part about £IOO of
hard-earned money or else stay ashore for life
with the official curse upon them and their
families. Again, the shipping companies

said that if the union couldn't suspend or
otherwise shake up members who deliberately
held up ships and thus made the union
look unpleasantly like a liar, they would
suspend the offenders themselves to the ex-
tent of not employing them. Whereupon the
officials suddenly developed the strength of
elephants and stated that they were there
to protect the job-control men, and were
quite competent to do so. Under no circum-
stances was any discrimination to be em-
ployed against the breakers of agreements,
however much discrimination the officials
might themselves use against members who
were slow in paying up in support of a
strike. These fluctuations between complete
weakness and unlimited strength show the
difference between Samson with his hair long
and Samson with his hair cut. This Samson
evidently carries a wig about with him.
The Government as Mineowner.
Queensland Mines-Minister Jones has pub-
lished a clumsy defence of his Government's
wild plunge into the mining business at Chil-
lagoe, where it has had to fight a by-election.
Jones made the assets of the concern
(£811,04S) look bigger than the indebted-
ness to the Treasury (£790,545) by
including last year’s loss of £29,000
with the former and omitting six years’
losses of £194,609 from the latter. Un-
paid interest amounting to £167,142 was
also omitted by Jones in his efforts to pro-
duce a credit balance. Assets (£505,507
worth fixed, and £275,613 worth liquid) were
mentioned without any stressing of the fact
that there was over 30s. worth of liquid
assets for every 20s. worth of the other sort in
1920. That was the year in which the Chil-
lagoe and Etheridge railways and the Chi 1-
lagoe smelters, mines and reduction works
were “taken over,” in the expressive Labor
phrase. Valuers appointed by the Govern-
ment declared the railways to be worth
£500,590. As regards the smelters and other
assets, someone in the Treasurer’s office sug-
gested that £40,000 would be a fair thing,
and they let it go at that. The Government
paid £701,000 for an outfit valued at
£540,590. Presently the Railway Depart-
ment was heard complaining that it was
“over the odds” to have to find interest on
“£160,408 more than the valuation put upon
the Chillagoe and Etheridge railways by the
valuers appointed for the purpose.” The
Auditor-General also stumbled over the item
and asked for light. Theodore, just back
from abroad on a loan-foraging expedition,
explained that "....the officers appointed
to revalue the Chillagoe and Etheridge rail-
ways adopted an arbitrary and unsound basis
for their calculations.” What basis liis'Gov-
ernment adopted was not expressly men-
tioned. There was, however, a statement
that the Commissioner for Railways had esti-
mated that the Chillagoe line, which cost
£381,902 to build in 1901. would have cost
£498,902 in 1915. Perhaps it might, but in
view of the very heavy depreciation of such,
works iu the North, and the neglect, of the
permanent-way and rolling-stock over most of
the period, the valuers’ estimate was pro-
bably not far out. The position at June. 30
last, according to reports of the Auditor-
General and the Railway Commissioner, shows
the cost to the taxpayer as follows:
Capital indebtedness—
Smelters, mines, etc. .. £790,545
Railways 240,855
T . £1,031,480
Losses-
Interest. (six years).. .. £167.142
On working mines .. .. 194,609
On working railways ... 93,814
Total expenditure .. .. .. £1,486,995
Capital expenditure and losses are £946,405
more than the Government valuers said the
whole business was worth. The value of
minerals won during the last two years was
£326,945, and the cost of production—ex-
clusive of railway losses —was £510.045. 111
other words, the Government has been get-
ting 20s. worth of mineral for every 31s. 2d.
of expenditure. Buying holes in the ground

pastime. Still. Queensland has this consola-
tion, that Chillagoe has been preserved as a
Labor pocket-borough.
"Trepex”: “Xamilc” (B. 7/l/’26) mixes
his facts so much to my misrepresentation
that I am compelled to return to the attack.
My par. (B. 26/11/’25) discussed only spin-
ning quality and not other features of wool.
No one with any pretence of knowledge
would dispute the superiority in condition
which New England and other N.S.W. table-
lands wools have over those from the Far
West of the State, but that in no way
touches spinning quality. His statement as
to the absurdity of comparing western wool
with the other falls into the category of
mere unsubstantiated assertion when we
consider the fact that the highest basis. (49
pence) on which Australian wools were
appraised for the Imperial purchase scheme
covered western N.S.W. and Queensland
classes. No New England lots were
appraised under this particular type. It is
the cleaner and more attractive condition and
better consequent yield Which gives the table-
lands staple its value —not the finer spin-
ning quality. Nor is the disparity in price
so great as “Xamilc” suggests. During
November, 3924, when wool reached the
highest level it has ever sold at in Australia,
and when therefore the difference in value
of the various types was likely to be most
marked, good representative tablelands wool
sold at from 45 to 50 pence (a very occa-
sional lot went a penny or so higher), and
western wools realised from 35 to 40 pence.
This is an average disparity of 10d., not
12 to 18_ pence as he states. To-day the dif-
ference is about fid. “Xamilc” also calls
me to account for my statement that under
identical climatic conditions saltbush-grown
wool is coarser than that from other pastures
and declares that tlie exact reverse is the
case, taking an unequal condition to prove
his point ( ride bis owh reference' to the light
rainfall of saltbush country). Having
bandied tens of thousands of bales of this
wool and hundreds of thousands of bales
altogether, I know that he is wrong and
could demonstrate it a hundred times in one
season on the woobbrokers’ floors. But to
take him on his own point, if he will examine
the fleece from the frontages of the lower
Lachlan or Murrumbidgee, for instance, he
will find it no coarser, but softer, to handle
than that from the saltbush hinterlands of
those rivers, while the staple from the sand

ridges which intersect these plains is finer
than either. Saltbush wop Is being almost
invariably of dry condition, one presumes
that most of the nourishment of the plant
goes into cell-production in the wool fibres,
little remaining as free fat or yolk, as in
the case with the grasses. But, as I said
before, there is not much absolutely definite
in these matters and wool lore is far from
an exact science. There are innumerable
contingent factors to every aspect of it.
“Feng-Sjiui” : The strenuous career of
General Hsu Siiu-tseng, which was finished
by a bullet the other day, is an interesting
example of how the white nations, in trying
to take a rise out of each other, get their
legs pulled by the subtle Chinaman. “Little
Hsu,” as he was called, was. a swashbuckler
who was credited with having murdered a
rival general over his own dinner-table.
Backed by Japan, he entered the field in
1918 against the bandits of the Government
with a banditry of his own. The Japanese
Consulate gave him sanctuary when he was
defeated, and when the Government called
for him he had mysteriously disappeared. He
next started a war in the vicinity of the
Foreign Settlement in Shanghai, under the
auspices, it was alleged, of oue of the Euro-
pean Governments which share in the admin-
istration of that city. He was arrested by
the foreign bobbies and deported to Europe.
Mean time the faction that he had led to
disaster in China had seized the Government,
and he was appointed special Industrial
Envoy. Paris, especially female Paris,
adores anything exotic, and the graceless
scamp enjoyed more prestige than Carpen-
tier, Ills popularity being all the greater
because he was believed to be an enemy of
Britain. Such are the tactics by which the
European Powers are steadily undermining
their influence in Asia.

“I AM not going to punish you for escaping
from custody," said the Old Bailey Recorder
the other day to a prisoner who bad not
only got out of Pentonville but. after be-
ing recaptured, had given six warders the
slip while being transferred to another prison.
"I must confess fo a sort of sneaking admira-
tion for you. I don’t blame- you for escap-
ing.” It’s a very human sentiment, .too, but
few Judges permit themselves such whole-
some frankness. Why should a prisoner get
an extra term of imprisonment when he has
made an unsuccessful bid for liberty unac-
Companied by violence? The forfeiture of liis
good-conduct marks will follow, anyhow, if
he is recaptured. And he is really under no
moral Obligation to stay in prison if he can.
get out of it. Yet in Australia, as in Britain,
recaptured escapees are almost always given
additional sentences for the mere act of
escaping, apart from any new crimes they
may have committed while at liberty. Bess
than 30 years ago a couple of Westralian
convicts were actually sentenced to the cat-
o’-nine-tails by a magistrate steeped in the
old traditions for having broken out of Fre-
mantle Gaol —as though anyone wouldn't if
he could.

Thebe is one feature that hitherto Austra-
lia has not been..able to put on its list of
tourist attractions. It has never had a good,
live volcano. A man from Twin Hills (Q.),
a lonely outpost SO miles from Clermont, has
reported that the long-felt want is about to
be supplied. lie has seen smoke rising, to
the accompaniment of ominous , rumblings,
from Mount Gregory, on Moray Downs
station. A onetime station-owner in the'
district traces the rumblings to displaced
rocks rolling down the mountain-side—says,
indeed, that he has heard similar rumblings
himself, knows the mount well, and has
never found trace of crater or signs of lava.
But it isn’t everyone who can tell a volcano
when he sees it. Away back in 1892 those
two fii-st-rate geologists Jack and Ether-
idge made a map of Queensland, and on it
marked all the then-known volcanic foci in
the State. Round about this very district
the red spots are numerous. South-east of
Mount Gregory there is an area of roughly
100 square miles in which one can count 30
or more foci. They are all long-extinct
volcanic vents; but an interesting note is
placed under Mount Gregory: “Subterranean
noises frequently heard.” Whether this in-
formation was gathered 33 years ago from
reliable sources or was mere tradition among
the blacks this paper does not know; but
obviously there is a larger possibility of vol-
canic life in this old cone than the station-
owner appears inclined to admit.

“Returned Full-dp” : A real snob's answer
was that of an official of the Marine Stew-
ards' Union to the complaints made by pas-
sengers on Commonwealth liners: he said
that these were "third-class boats,” and the
people who travel upon them should not
expect the treatment of saloon travellers
on first-class vessels. Apparently the soul
of a lackey becomes more deplorably lackey-
ish-in a democracy than elsewhere. It was
against the service supplied by the boats’ em-
ployees. mainly the stewards, that the pas-
sengers' chief complaints were levelled, not
against the accommodation or food;-and, re-
ceiving the same wages as and better condi-
tions than the stewards on the classier boats,
those, on the Commonwealth liners should be
prepared to supply the same service. As
democrats, the fact that the passengers pay
less passage-money than those on other ves-
sels should make no difference to them; but
apparently the fact that one lot can tip well
and the other lot can’t is regarded as ade-
quate reason for differential treatment. Upon
which it is useful to recall that the union’s
official attitude when seeking an award was
that tips (which the employers mentioned as
a regular source of income) were altogether
undesirable. The union claimed wages that
would enable the men to make a living with-
out submitting to the “humiliation” of having
to accept tips, llow much honesty there was
in that claim is pretty well indicated by the
defence offered for the Commonwealth line’s
stewards.

“Padraic” : While agreeing with everything
The Bulletin has to say in “The Teacher
that Isn’t.” it may be pointed out that the
N.B.W. Education Department has made no
attempt to cope with the shortage of peda-
gogues except by admitting a tribe of “tem-
porary” teachers, some of whom have been
in the service for 20 years, and are denied
the rights of permanent officers in the way
of promotions, pensions and so on. The
I iepartment’s policy of running up a little
shack, calling it a school, and putting a
qualified teacher in charge whenever a few
parents gather together and emit a sufficiently
loud roar, is at fault. The State requires
fewer small schools and more conveyances,
so that children can be whisked quickly and
safely to central schools, thus rendering
possible much economy in staffing, building
and equipment. At present, especially in the.
coastal districts, where population is com-
paratively thick and roads could be worse,
scores of these little buildings are memorials
to the fact that the Department has not heard
of the development of motor traffic in the
last 20 years; and a considerable portion of
the time Mr. Cane should devote to his job
is wasted in thinking out schemes by which
he may attract half a dozen of Mr. Tawse’s
youthful thirsters at the fount of knowledge
to his own Pierian spring. He does this so
that his attendance may increase, and the
“class” of his school with it, bringing, of
course, a better status. The injured Mr.
Tawse will probably try to recoup himself
at the expense of Mr. Birch (three miles
farther on), and so the story goes. When
the Education Department knocks every
half-dozen of these pitiful huts into one well-
lighted. cool, airy school, fit for young Aus-
tralia to wrestle with his “letters” in, it
will have knocked a hole in the shortage and
taken a step forward in general efficiency
as well. There is no shortage of motor-
drivers.
“Two Seas ’ : Now that city motorists go so
far afield during holiday time for a sniff of
the gum-trees, it wduld be a good thing if
the Government or Shire Councils provided
camping grounds where wood and water could
be obtained by the tourists, as is done in
Murka. At present, the motor camper
pitches his tent anywhere, and litters the
landscape with empty tins and other rubbish.
The absence of firewood doesn’t worry him.

the cockies’ fencing-posts to boil his billy.

at his fence adjoining a spot where 10 car's

POLITICAL
POINTS
The great cheap loan scheme, with Fed-
eral liability behind it, for promoting immi-
gration and land-settlement in the States is
mentioned in the Bruce-Page programme for
the new Parliament. So is a project for the
provision of £20,000,000 for roads in the
States, and for an advance of £3,000,000 to
the States for wire-netting. Unluckily, the
Bruce-Page Government appears unable to
get a solid grip on the fact that it owns and
is responsible for a very big State itself
(nearly one-fifth of Australia, indeed), which
is as badly in want of being settled, and
bounded, and wire-netted, and roaded, and
dog-proof-fenced as any other place. In that
respect Federal Governments tend to be very
much alike.
The election of Littleton Groom to the
Federal Speakership recalls the first election
to that chair when his late father was a can-
didate. He had been Speaker in Queens-
land, and was the only member outside Bar-
ton’s Cabinet who had handled the gavel;
but he was cast aside foe 1 Fred Holder, who
had to be placated for his omission from
the Ministry. Groom, senior, in his wrath,
told a heedless world thaj. he was legislating
25 vears before Holder emtered politics, and
when Barton and Beid were in knickers.
Father and sou have established a record by
representing the same district (Toowoomba)
for a continuous period of 05 years.
The N.S.W. Government considers that if
it goes back to one-member constituencies
(laid out afresh with an ejye to business) and
the simplest form of election, the representa-
tive of the best-manipulated machine will
win. A case of Worst Ptast the Post.
Allenby proved a magnet sufficient to draw
to Melbourne State members from all parts
of Vic. when an invitation to a Government
lunch was broadcasted. They gave up the
time occupied in travelling and the two
hours for the feast with a better gi ace than
they would have yielded it had a brief sitting
been held to put the finishing touches on an
important bill. Ministers had taken care to
issue the prorogation proclamation two days
before They therefore felt safe and could
afford to be genial. The thing the Vic.
legislative body feels least capable ot is
legislation.
Australia is sending away some £8,000,000
yearly for motor spirit, and is always be-
coming more dependent on the substauce. It
is known that power alcohol can be manu-
factured from various Australian products.
And it is believed that the stuff can be pro-
duced at moderate cost and in sufficient
quantities if the industry only gets a big
start, which is difficult in an agitated land
where seven Governments borrow most of
the capital in sight. So the Federal Gov-
ernment proposes a bonus of 4d. per gallon,
divided between the distiller and the grower
of materials, to a limited extent, for a very
limited period. To quote the report:
In moving the second reading of the Bill the
Minister of Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten) said
the proposed bounty amounted to only £25,000, at
the rate of 115000 a year.
In other words, it is an effort to encourage
the production of not more than 400,0UU
gallons of spirit per annum, or about half
of one per cent, of the quantity now used, said
encouragement to stop just about' the time
the infant industry has cut its first tooth.
And the Government is as apologetic even
about that as if Australian industry was a
crime and a mangled remains.
The political jobbing house of Lang and
Co., No Liability, dealers in gold passes and
odd bills, has for the second time brought
down an amendment to the N'.fe.\Y. Local
Government Act. The first document was
improved by a few amendments in the Leg*
Council. The new measure was passed in
arrogant defiance of the pleadings of shire
and municipal councillors, who are hurriedly
being turned out of office in December next,
despite that they were elected by the rate-
payers for a three-year term less than three
months ago. The now bill provides that the
FIXED.
“The N.S.W. Labor caucus has vetoed all the Leg. Council’s amendments to the Pa[?]liamentary Elections
Bill. Chief See. Lazzarini declared that the Government could be trusted to do the fair thing."

Oup."

franchise shall be extended to the nursegirl,
the temporary inhabitants of flats, the casual
laborer and anyone else, provided lie is aged
21 years, who happens into a district 01
is brought there on a three months job.
And Lang and Co. guarantee the new rights
free of all obligation. The newly-franchised
are eligible to become councillors and as sucn
may even borrow large sums of money, -but
the privilege of paying the rates and taxes is
reserved exclusively for the non-casual or
permanent resident, whose interest m the
district is likely to be lasting.
When Eacliam (N.Q.) was reckoned a
certainty for Gillies, sometime Labor Secre-
tary for Agriculture and Premier, the elec-
toral population did not grow to any extent.
Between the 1020 and 1923 State elections,
it actually declined, the totals being 0710
in 1920 and ,1590 at the last election, (Inci-
dentallv. there were 440,087 names on the
State rolls in 1923, and only 406,228 on the
Federal register, closed five months before.)
But when Gillies had retired to a better
hole and the outlook was dubious, the con-
stituency which had lost 126 electors in three
years acquired 1154 in about three months.
This capacity for rising to the occasion
(almost bounding to it, as it were) is really
heroic.
The Queensland State Opposition never
looked to have a chance of winning Chula-
goe, into which the Labor Government has
poured loan money at the rate of about
£4OO an elector. Leal, the Herberton man
who took on the forlorn hope, did well to
get within 500 votes of Labor-publican
O’Keefe, seeing that ex-Premier Theodores
majorities were 1384 to 394 in 1920 and
2459 to 1083 in 1923.
The reshuffle of-M.L. portfolios, expected
ever since the election in November, is neither
very courageous nor drastic. Though laying
it down that “a Prime Minister should not
be burdened with a mass of administrative
detail connected with State departments,
Coates hangs on to Railways and TV 6rks,
the two big spending departments. The tem-
porary re-arrangement after Massey’s death
threw Finance into the lap of Nosworthy,
and this queer arrangement is to be continued
till the end of the year for some unexplained
reason, when Downie Stewart, the best-read
and best-liked member of the Ministry, will
take over the Treasury. Hawken of Egmont
relieves Nosworthy of Agriculture, and that
is all right; Downie Stewart relieves Dillon
Bell of the Attorney-Generalship, but the
veteran knight will still attend Cabinet
meetings. Maui I’omare,- whose administra-
tion of Health has been more tempestuous
than beneficial, despite his medical qualifica-
tions, hands the department over to J. A.
Young, whose executive ability remains to
be proved. F. J. Rolleston of Timaru. an-
other Cabinet novice, takes and
relieves Parr of Justice —Parr finds educa-
tion enough of a handful.
Loughlin, the ablest member of the N.S.W.
Labor Government, is fathering a bill to regis-
ter land-agents and fix their fees. Similar
legislation has arrived in S.A.; and the
Victorian law, now a year old, lias tidied
up, to some extent, a business badly in need
of tidying. Louglilin’s proposal will be
doubly welcome if the net is spread to cover
parasites who make a living from obstructed
members of the public through them know-
ledge of red-tape. The exasperated appli-
cant to the Barnacle Department is given a
friendly whisper that Blank may be able to
force' through for him the small matter about
which there has been a long, mysterious delay.
Blank is usually delighted to be of service
for a consideration—and tlie way matters
rush through to finality once he takes a liana
is astonishing.
The Commonwealth Government is setting
un two Commissions to show it the rignt
track. Nicholas Dockyer, lately Customs
chief, will wrestle with the financial and
other problems of Tasmania; and h unk
Whysall, lately Postal chief in. N. Wales,
will inquire into the wails and ‘unses -
have lately floated ashore from Noifolk
Island. Each is as good an dflieei
Department ever produced; and theie s
lot of work left in both of them.
One of the few streaks of luck which come
in the Australian bobby’s way is that he car-
ries a pair of handcuffs, and it he contrives
to put them on the biggest ot the larrikins
who attack him with bottles he is better able
to manage the other two. or six. It is now
proposed, so far as N.S.W. is concerned, to
deprive the uniformed man of the brace-
lets.” and thus give the push a better run
fur its money. r llns ideu is stud to be based
on the observations made by a wandering
Commissioner in England and elsewhere. But
in " England, by latest iigures, there were
5G.532 policemen, besides reserves, or close,
on one per square mile. In N.S.W. t,ure
were 281-5, or one per 101) square miles,
which makes a difference. Even according to
population the protection in N.S.W. is very
small, yet it shows up better than the Aus-
tralian 1 average. Even the most sincere sym-
pathiser with the bottle-shying brigade should
take these matters into account.
N.S.W. Premier Dang’s habit of being u
nark is developing a boomerang effect. Allan,
the Vie. Premier, has announced that lie
will see the Ma State Government blowed
before he honors the. life railway passes,
“good over every railway in Australia,
which Dang has promised the 99 Deg. Coun-
cillors when (or if! the latter are demobbed.
There is a precedent, for when the Queens-
land Council was paid off on similar terms,
Victoria refused to recognise its passes.
Opposition-leader Bavin has hinted, furthei.
that when the Coalition which he leads re-
turns to office in Sydney, the gold medallions
will be no good as regards N.S.W . either, so
there is cold comfort in the situation tor
honorable deadheads who may cease to be
legislators.
A big shuffle of public buildings m Sydney
is promised if Dang's political life lasts long
enough. The Dabor Premier is trying to get
a big slice of the Victoria Barracks site from
the Commonwealth Government, in order to
establish tlie Sydney Hospital there. Old
Parliament House will be torn down, and <
new one erected ; and buildings to house some
of the public departments will go up where
the Hospital and the Mint now stand. J-hc
latter is to cease operations at the end ot
the year—all the minting for the Common-
wealth will be done in Canberra when the
Federal Parliament moves there. 1 lie scheme
includes provision for new law-courts be-
tween these offices and the Registiar
General’s: but hangs upon the will-
ingness of scrtrßmody to cash our iV> V ,
and even the Dabor Herald (Dond.) is sug-
gesting that it is about time we gave J. Bull
a chance to recover his breath.

vestment for Government money or private
capital. ,
During the argument which preceded the
appointment of Dittleton Groom as Speaker
of the Reps., Yates, Dabor M.H.R. for Adel

HIS ONLY CHANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“When your Excellency asked for the division lists
of the Legislative Council, you were reminded that
all' such information was contained in Hansard,
copies of which had been supplied to you V our
Excellency will remember describing the publication
as ‘these little books.’ ” —Extract from the corres-
pondence between Governor de Chair and Premier
Lang regarding the appointment of 25 new members
to the N.S.W. Legislative Council.
These little books! What could a sailor draw
Of guidance from this wilderness of jaw,
Division lists, committees and what not,
Punctilious chronicles of dreary rot ?
A simple log a chap could understand,
But these abominations beat the band —
The barren wastes of garrulous debate,
Sly questions that are never answered straight,
Slabs of self-praise and virulent abuse,
Recrimination windy and diffuse.
It puzzles me how ev’n a landsman brooks
These little books.
I’ve sailed from wintry Horn to Hebrides;
They set me navigating stormier seas
Where treacherous currents all too oft are found
And sudden gales arise and reefs abound.
Even a briny Admiral perforce
Must have a chart whereby to steer a course.
But when I asked for some such aid because
I really hadn’t a notion where I was,
They send an understrapper, if you please,
With half a sugar-bag or so of these —
The sort of tack that makes one damn the cooks —
These little books !
Ah! could I feel again—what bliss complete
’Twould be! —the quarterdeck beneath my feet,
And plough anew the ocean’s billowy track
With none to argue or to answer back!
The silent service mine, with yap taboo,
Nor ever two words used when one would do.
Give me the quiet gulls before the birds
Who force me to their will with floods of words
And, when I buck, insist that I shall read—
I of the Nelson and the Benbow breed—
(lVhat an intolerable task it looks)
These little books!

At the 1924 meeting the chairman, greatly
daring, said that profits should be regarded
as clos* 1 to high-water mark. lie had the
pleasant job at the recent meeting of revis-
ing his prophecy, for net income beat the
previous year's by £37,325. Advantage had
been taken to write more off premises, while
£66,313 was added to visible reserves. It
may be safely guessed, too, that, apart from
the waiting down of premises, other internal
reserves were not neglected. Still, odd
wisps of black cloud were scattered among
shareholders:—-
The wool position was not devoid of anxietv.
He [the chairman] found it difficult to view the
immediate future with any great degree of confidence.
Tile directors felt it wise [owing to the possibility
ot trouble] to retain a larger percentage of profits
than usual in the carry-forward.
Actually, although it seems most unlikely
that the co.’s current year will be other
than very prosperous (accounts close on
June 30), nothing is lost by remembering
the bad things that might lmppen. It is a
wise management that thinks in the fat
year of the lean one that lurks around a
bend along the road.
Here are revenue and expenditure figures:

Total outgoings £064,721£681,081£062,991 £677,908
Both taxes and interest charges were lighter,
but increased exes, more than offset that
advantage. In four years they have in-
creased by £55,571; that will be rather a
substantial amount to reduce when tile lean
years come. The directors are considering
“various means of increasing the co.'s re-
sources, because, should the business expand
as it had done during the past, few 7 years,
they could employ a substantial amount
advantageously.” Along what lines the con-
sideration will run is not indicated. For 17
years capital has boon stationary at 14
millions; the perpetual and terminable de-
bentures have varied both in volume and
variety, the. old 3 p.c. to 4 p.c. having been
displaced chiefly by 6-4 p.c. terminables. Here
are figures for the past three years:—

Cash & investments 3,014,716 2,602,018 1,420,074
Of the liabilities tlie chief factor in the in-
crease of almost a million was the expan-
sion of bills payable from £101,300 to
£1,039,403. The large increase in advances,
£1.573,459, and the fall in cash to £133,227
from £812,470 and in investments (apart
from reserve fund investments) to £286,847
from £650,862 give point to the chairman's
comment. The position disclosed by the
accounts, however, did not long endure. Since
June the position has largely righted itself,
for practically all the carry-over wool was
cleared after the resumption of selling. Last
year’s events forced the co. to make use of
a substantial portion of the sum it had put
aside chiefly in cash and public securities
(“investments” of the balance-sheet at June
30, 1924, were 93 p.c. gilt-edged). That was
a departure, and it looks as it' there was a
recognition of the necessity of greater enter-
prise. Apart from the reserve fund of a mil-
lion a big amount has always been kept in
I‘. ail'd L. Of the inner reserves, some at
least are in view. At June 80, £1,056,344
had been expended on premises and plant, and
they had been written down to £421,844. Also,,
while reserve fund investments are in the
books at a round million, their face value
is £301,860 greater. As, everything going
well, most of those will be held to maturity,
the co. is going to reap a nice protit from
them.
Looking back on 1924-25, the record profit
—an almost common expmnence among the
wool firms —is easily explained :
Australasian wool production amounted to 2,656,554
bales—a record. Prices realised for two-thirds oi
the Australian and most of the Maoriland clip were
almost unprecedented. Most of the M.L. wool was
sold before the slump came. The average per bale
(Australasian) worked out at £33 13s. lOd. compared
with £29 9s. 9d. in 1923-24. Even the portion
sold realised £69,083,182 as against £64,929,298 for
the full clip of the previous year. There was a
record production of butter in Australia, exports
to England showing an increase of 134 p.c., and the
average price was higher than in the preceding season.
Maoriland maintained its position as the largest
exporter of dairy produce in the world, £18,000,000
worth being sent to England. Last year’s wheat
crop was 160,400.000 bushels, which is next to the
record. Prices obtained were high owing to crop
failures elsewdiere.
In all these primary products Dalgety's are
interested. It is not surprising that the
Rickety Isles got a special word: “New
Zealand contributed largely to the successful
year....”
The present year has prospects beyond the
average. The wool clip is expected to be
greater, though quality may not be as good
as the previous season's. Wheat and butter
production will be less, and prices are ex-
pected to. be rather lower. But the pros-
perity which has its roots in the phenomenal
conditions of 1924-25 will be reflected for a
while longer. Spelter and lead prices are
holding, and the stream of borrowings is still
pouring out to add to the better-based pros-
perity. Dalgety's shareholders see £2,736,364
o.f net tangible assets to represent their
!..>OO.OOO of 5 p.c. profs, and £1,000,000 of
ordinaries,‘-and they catch glimpses of sufficient
of the internal strength to judge that there
is probably a groat deal out of sight. They
know that, even though 7 p.c. of their last
return was labelled “bonus,” they have ex-
cellent chances of receiving 17 p.c. for this
year. And the co.’s clients rest content in
ilie knowledge that they can be nursed over
any of the troubles of which Australia has
had experience.

Records were to be expected; and the good
season 19w4-wO and the better wool prices
poured profits into the coffers of this Eng-
lish co. One of the things which helped
most was the co. s possession of big areas
or its own. The clip from its stations totalled
r-ni.J. es ’ whlcll realised £299,909, or
* ‘, more than for the previous year.
And there were the rich earning's from its
commission business. In common with other
wool concerns the A.M.L. had a substantial
carry-over—the influence is visible in
balance-sheet figures—but at the annual
meeting, held in London on November 19
(accounts close on June 80), shareholders
were told that practically all of it had been
sold. The co. had issued, in May, 60.000 £5
shares and the £300,000 was found irumedi-
i! That lifted paid capital to
r>o(W» 7 f i f 22 -wr unpaid)—£6oo.ooo in
1-.0.000 fully-paid £5 shares and £600,000
m £«o shares paid to £5. Debenture stock
increased from £1.898,640,t0 £2,000,000. The
co. had held £101,360 worth, but finding that
k could employ the money the stock was
re-issued. It was, of course, placed at a
“ ls uuunt;whi6h latter was written off. With
£1,900,000 at 4 p.c. and £lOO,OOO at 3. p.c. the
A. M. and L. is in a nice position. Other
balance-sheet items were:—

Sundry creditors, by the way, are, for the
most part, customers’ credit balances.
“Mortgages, etc.,” was £235,197 heavier, but
last year there was a re-grouping and
£204,921 of fixed deposits was removed from
the item and included, more correctly, with
cash, so the actual expansion in the co.'s. big
financing business was that much greater.
The sharp rise—£lB4.6so —in book debts re-
flected the wool position as at June last.
These, by the way, represent “loans to clients
of such undoubted standing that it is per-
fectly safe to lend to them without taking
formal security.” And as the A.M.L. has
been in the business for almost two-thirds of
a century it, ought to know its marks. The
net increase, of £27,379 in the premises item
is a sign of the expansion which still marks
the history of the co. Considering the co.’s
huge stores and its valuable office buildings
in Australia and a London city freehold, the
£331,403 which represents these assets in the
accounts is very modest. Writing off is
done with a vigorous pen. Prospects are
bright for another good year since the
November rains, and although some areas
have had more than they want the general
position is favorable. Wool gives every in-
dication of holding at about present highly
profitable levels.
Four years ago the co.’s articles were
altered to permit of the capitalisation of re-
serves, but apparently the Board favors par
issues, and increased divs. when income ex-
pands, rather than gift issues. In any case
the increase in capital has caused a relative
decrease in reserves, although these are sub-
stantial. Gross, profits bear allowance for
contingencies, and it is plain that there are
internal resources. Altogether the co.’s
clients can takb comfort from the fact that
it is solid to see them over the next
bad spell that happens along.

Only once in the last 16 years have profits
been less. , Thie Board promptly dropped the
div. a furtjher two points, thus adhering to
a course it had followed in earlier years. It
was a troublesome period for the meat in-
dustry in Maofriland, and the Canterbury dis-
closed profits equivalent to less than 5 p.e.
on total mean funds. And where the Can-
terbury has had to struggle it is not sur-
prising that other meat-exporting cos., born
or reared in tb prosperity of the war
years and the meat-purchase scheme, are in
difficulties or skating along the verge. The
year was ojne of the worst ever experienced,
according to Maoriland freezers and export-
ers. Prices of stocks were high—“the highest
on record,” declared one chairman—while
there was uncertainty in the home market
owing to the high prices for wool at the open-
ing sales and the subsequent sharp fall on
this side* and weakness in meat and lamb
on the English market. To cap these troubles
freezing charges, under vtery keen competi-
tion, were the lowest for many years.
• i .
'Reserves were drawn on for £3703 to pay
the divs. There was, however, plenty of
excuse for the 10 p.e. distribution to ords..
for m earlier years the co.'s hand-out was
modest; arid when the war brought the
Canterbury enormous profits the directors
sept much more to reserves than they dis-
tributed —this apart from expansion that
was met oufiiof revenlue, a comforting charac-
teristic wbh'h these figures disclose:—

b reezing works, and stock-holding areas are
numerous and extensive. Additions during
the year moved the book value up £4383 to
£327,634. In view of the constitution of
the Board, witfi George Clifford, Bart., as
chairman, it njay safely be assumed that
these assets are worth more than that. Since
1915 they have increased in the books by
£44,306. There now are two more freezing
works, apart altogether from other acquisi-
tions, so the ! amounts charged against
revenue must have been substantial. Last
year’s expansion of liabilities amounted to
£146,455 and the liquid and semi-liquid
assets to £136,120. Some substantial ship-
ments must have been unrealised at the close
of. the accounts. The co. did not fall into
the error of several M.L. concerns and issue
during the boom wads of new capital which
it did not need; on]y £16,700 (plus £734 pre-
miums) has been added since 1915. 'pi u .
visible improvement is evident. There are
in addition, those resources which a cautious
management has placed out of sight What
their dimensions are it is impossible to sav
But Canterbury shareholders are to-day
reaping the benefit of a long-sighted policy
and they can pay in their latest div. cheques
tolerably sure that they will get another
decent return next year, unless something
very bad happens to present improving con-
ditions.

£LO,QOQ. The sale, however, doesn’t mean
a departure from the eo.’s policy of property
purchase, for it acquired another freehold in
the suburbs at which it established the usual

doubt, so long as property values are 011
the up grade and advances on mortgage are
easily obtained;. but it may mean a pretty
stiff struggle in bad times. Certainly such
a co. as this gets some business in bad times
which it wouldn’t get in good ones; but ex-
perience shows that even traders under the
sign of the three balls make most money
when times are so good that people spend
recklessly. At any rate, the co. that has all
its capital and more invested in properties
must either have large reserves, visible or
invisible, _ or be doing a highly profitable
business if it can continue to give its share-
holders 10 p.e. on their capital under all
conditions.

supplies and higher wages were blamed; and
unless the management can see definite pros-
pects of better conditions the payment of the

preciation, etc.,” was increased to £lO,OOO
(the “etc.” is apparently taxation, and should
he shown separately) ; with property in at
£33,810 and equipment at £21,265 (up £295),
this should be adequate cover for wear and
tear and breakages. It is not considered a
true reserve in the introductory table. The

ceded, and there will have to be solid improve-
ment if present divs. are to be justified. At
least the co ; has this in its favor: assuming
that depreciation has been fully covered, its

£1469 of accumulated profits.

Robert Reid and Co., Ltd., tbe lenders
lane wholesale house, tells Ihe Bm.EE .
that it has no holding of shares in Buckley
and Nunn, Ltd. “A few 7 p.c. prefs.,
onlv holding, were disposed of some time
ago/’ Robert Reid is, however, chairman ot
both cos., and two of the directors of Robert
Reid and Co. are on the Board of Buckley
and Nunn. # •
Okiomo Oil, Ltd., is being formed to pur-
chase from the Oriomo Oil Co., lAa., its
license to prospect for oil and coal m the
western division of Papua. Capital.. is
£200,000 in £1 shares; 55,000 fully-paids go
to vendors; 100,000 contribs. are offered the
public; 45,000 to be held in reserve. A little
more than a year ago the syndicate co.
was formed to make a detailed contour sur-
vey. Results, contained in the prospectus,
show that the expedition has fulfilled ns
promises in an unusually thorough manner.
An area of 500 square miles was explored
and a detailed contour survey made ot an
area of 25 square miles. In all, 10 domes
were found. One was bored to 1-o Oft., oil-
scum, strong smell of crude oil and kerosene,
gas and paraffin-wax being brought up from
between 771 and 776 feet.” The proposal
is that Captain McLean and Lieut. Koyle
should again proceed to the area and con-
tinue the surveying and drilling m accord-
ance with the recommendations of the co. s
geologist. The country shows no sign of un-
due folding; “sufficient to cause the neces-
sary concentration but not enough to cause
excessive fracturing or faulting.” Seepages
are absent, although the promising brine
and sulphur springs are present throughout
the area. The co. starts off with consider-
able detail-work completed, which has given
it a knowledge of its area greater than that
of any recent flotation. If oil_ is there m
payable quantities this crowd is going the
right way to find it.
* * * *
Under the Mineral Oil and Coal Ordinance
of Papua, from Dec. 21, 1925, the reward
area conferred on holders of 1000 square
miles prospecting leasdS in the territory of
Papua, if the licensee discovers payable oil,
will be four square miles. Hitherto the
reward lease was 640 acres. This brings
Papua into line with the conditions govern-
ing licenses in the Mandated Territory.
B. H. Prop, has sold its share interest in
the Associated Smelters Prop. Ltd. The
North, B. H. South and Zinc Corp. purchased
the holding. These three cos. now possess
sole control of the Smelters; under arrange-
ment. the concentrate of the Prop, will be
purchased. At the present time the big
smelters, always looked upon as the last
word in plant, are being reconstructed ni
order to maintain the high standard of effi-
ciency. The B. 11. Prop, finds that its iron
and steel works can take all its capital.

The latest development in connection with
the Flagstone tin field, Emmaville (N.S.WJ,
is the amalgamation of the interests of
the parent co. with the West Flagstone and
Cartwheel leases. The Flagstone and
West Flagstone holders are, with few excep-
tions, an interlocking arrangement, and the
parent co. holds a development option over
the Cartwheel. The present issue of
6000 £5 shares is to be doubled. With the
new paper the Cartwheel will be appeased
with 2000 shares of the nominal value ot
£5; and West Flagstone’s interests, inclu-
sive of some £3OOO in cash, will be acquired
by issue of 3750 shares paid to £5 each, in
place of the present register of 25j000 Vi-
dors’ paid to 10s. and 25,000 con-
trihs. paid to ss. By this process the ven-
dors’ scrip in the West Flagstone will be
exchanged at the ratio of 1 m 10, and the
contribs. at 1 in 20. The solitary co
emerging from the flux will have 103 acres
of leases instead of 20 acres, and amended
articles will read that 60 000 20s. shares
will replace 12,000 at £o. The 36,000
paids will have a face value of 20s.
and the 24.000 contribs. be paid to Bs. Ihe
principle of consolidating adjoining interests
if more generally adopted in mining, would
make for abolition of overlapping adminis-
trative costs, but care should be exercised
it has not been in this case —that a majority
of vendors’ interests are not in a position to
levy on a call-paying minority. #
North Kalgurli (W.A.) showed a small
credit balance last year against a slight loss
for the previous 12 months. The co. s Kal-
goorlie property is still being worked under
tribute and the Board is adverse to any alter-
ation in existing arrangements while dis-
abilities at present placed on Westrafian
mining exist.” Apart from the North Kal-
gurli mine, the co.’s assets comprise shares
in Australian and other ventures, which were
described by the chairman at the recent
annual meeting as more speculative than gilt-
edged. They are.
* * *
Encouraged by Golden Horseshoe’s success,
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) is appealing for
“Government consideration.” Industrial con-
ditions, it is claimed, compel the co. to trent
ore higher than the average grade of the
mine, and it is in order to put an end to this
ruinous policy that Government assist-
airce to* bring down costs is sought. The co.
has other interests in Cornwall and Cali-
fornia. but their prospects are not attractive.
* * * *
Particulars of abandoned leases which once
produced gold in small or large quantities are
again being broadcasted in the West. Some
fields are declared to be full of such areas.
Mines Department records show that thou-
sands of leases which produced in the aggre-
gate over two. millions sterling are now idle.
Many, it'is'said, were worked in the days
when roads were, few, railways unknown,
water scarce and crushing facilities pool.
Optimists contend that under present condi-
tions some of these- could be mined at a profit.
There are, however, quite a lot which
couldn’t, and the danger of. drawing a blank
keeps capital at a distance.

Fresh interest is being takeh in the Anger
and Lancfewood tin alluvials in the Emas-
leigh (N.Q.) district; 300 men were pros-
pecting on the former some years ago.
Lately a couple of small rich patches--
going up to 101 b. a yard—have beem found,
but the big game is the Anger lead, five to
six miles long, occasionally up to 400 yards
wide, and with depth generally improved.
It is certain there are enormous quantities
of wash to be tested, but in the shafts put
down so far the concentrates have been
mainly iron and: gem sand, with poor
showings of tin. The richness of thin seams
in some of the other places makes it hard
to relinquish this channel without spending
more cash on it, and it is likely that a
northern syndicate will try a boring cam-
paign on selected areas. There is tin there,
all right, but it’s a question of finding an
area where natural concentration has played
a part, such as in the vicinity of bars or
pools. #
“FY7”: Work is coming more and more
under the’ ban in Queensland. Not long ago
a “darg” was declared at the Blair Athol
Nos. 2 and 3 mines. A couple of miners
overlooked the fact, and had the temerity to
earn £2l 10s. more than the union limit tor
a month’s work. Ordered to pay the tainted
lucre into the union funds, the too energetic
pair refused. All the other men in the pit
struck until the offenders were discharged,
and the Government, which runs the mines,
lost. no time in complying with the ulti-
matum.
* * * *
“Iv.”: It is about time attention was
drawn to the wretched spin that oil-pros-
pecting cos. here and in Maoriland have had
from the imported driller. My experience has
been that these gentry, demanding and get-
ting extravagant salaries, often double to
treble what our own drillers make, arc hope-
lessly at sea in interpreting the results ot
their boring work, and in the actual sinking
of the borehole are invariably slower than
Australians and no better than they at com-
bating water troubles. Where they do slime,
however, is in rotary work, where speed and
rushing down to the supposed oil * sand,
irrespective of tlie formations passed through,
are the chief considerations. The use of a
core-barrel in connection with rotary drill-
ing in new fields so that some idea of struc-
ture can be elucidated is anathema to the
ordinary American driller, and I am on
fairly safe ground when making the state-
ment that an absolutely reliable log ot any
bore yet drilled here or in Maoriland on the
rotary system is not in existence. The main
source of supply for the men is the eastern
oil States, where conditions differ from those
of any other part of the world. For Australian
conditions give me the Australian water-borer
every time, and excellent work has been
done even in foreign fields by our own men.
Once a field has been proved oil-bearing,
then it is a question of bringing in the oil-
production men, and Americans and Gali-
cians are undoubtedly the bent m that
branch.

Ratrut (F.M.S.) December run in the new
area acquired from the Siamese Tin Syndi-
cate gave 10 1 tons oxide from 65.000 yards
—a drop of 41 tons below the November
figure, or a net drop of 21 tons after allow-
ing for four days lost on dredge repairs.
This s!oz. ground won’t pay many divs. if
it is to'be the average over the new property.
The directors, however, express confidence
that brighter patches will help.
Nawng Pet (F.M.S.) has had an expen-
sive demonstration of the danger of having
three dams overlooking the mining site and
perched one above another on a steep hill-
side. “On November 26 the floods on the
hill behind tlie mine were unprecedented.
Unfortunately, “unprecedented” occurrences
are not as unusual as they ought to be. In
this case it means that the three dams be-
came one while the flood surged through,
carrying logs and tree-trunks and heavy
deposits of silt torn from the hillside. The
lower dam almost ceased to exist, and the
14 acres of ground already worked and con-
taining the existing faces merely provided
a lodgment for the bulk of the debris. The
Pelton wheel and electric generator were car-
ried away, and the lower sets of elevators
submerged. “Energetic measures, accord-
ing to the official report, were calculated to
clear the actual mining area in a month, but
no estimate is given as to the reconditioning
of the dams and machinery replacements.
* * * *
Having weathered the rainy season, Tha-
bawleik, Burma, is pushing on with dredge-
construction, and should commence earth-
eating about July. The market remains
about the healthy figure of 475., for winch
the solid backing of the Austral Malay
stable may be partly responsible. .It is a
tidy premium, but Austral Malay is a good
leaning-post. » ♦ *
The earth's surface has solidified suffi-
ciently about the Gulf of Papua to permit
of the New Guinea Oil Co.'s two boilers
being deposited on the bore site at Hohoro.
As erection of the derrick is being proceeded
with, an almost-forgotten venture may yet
provide some interesting drilling reports.
A. W. Palfreyman told Ronpibon share-
holders at the annual meeting that the dredge
would finish its job on the Extended and turn
into Ronpibon ground in March, lake all
other Governments, the Siamese is clutching
for revenue in nil directions, and has noti-
lied the co. that the Thalerm leases must be
either worked or cancelled, The area 18
a couple of miles from Ronpibon, and the
actual work done on it may be gauged from
the Siamese Government’s gentle suggestion
that “perhaps boring, jungle-clearing and
oilier developmental work would be under-
taken”; it added that if this were done the
Government might be influenced to grant an
extension of the leases.” Palfreyman advised
the meeting that the position was serious,
and immediate steps must be taken it the
leases were to be retained. Attempts to de-
velop them in conjunction with neighboring
leaseholders had broken down.
* * * *
“Ker” on the development of prospecting:
Testing the presence of ore-bodies by radio methods,
as in Fraser’s recently-described apparatus, marks the
latest advance in the application of geophysical
methods to mineral prospecting. Already determina-
tion of the distribution of masses of rocks of unequal
gravity by means of the torsional balance, or by
magnetic surveying, has reached a high pitch m
Sweden, Germany and U.S.A., and the differentiation
obtained when introducing an electric current into
lion-homogeneous substrata has led to remarkable
developments in underground prospecting at all
depths. Methods using acoustic or seismic
wave-propagation are being developed tor different
special cases of underground tectonic geology up to
2500 feet, but they are not applicable to steeply
inclined strata. The torsional balance determines
anticlines and synclines, salt-domes, lenses of varies,
igneous rocks, “buried hills” and faults, purely by
recording differences in gravity of rocks of different
species and configuration. It has had a remarkable
run of success in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Rou-
mania Egypt, Canada, Texas and the mid-Contmemal
fields, and several big oil corporations have engineer-
geologists specially trained in the work. Magnetic-
surveys in oil fields are quick, cheap and easny
made. In a homogeneous stratum a distinctly
symmetrical field of equi-potential curves is obtained,
but inequality of conductivity deforms the curves,
producing a divergence in the case of poor conductor,
like oil and oil shale and a convergence in the
case of good conductors like most ore-bodies. As all
gco-phvsical methods have been found to apply to
oil finding as well as to ore-deposition there is every
reason to hope for a similar application in the case
of Fraser’s radio method, with of course a reverse
action to that usually observed for “placer” minerals;
and although this continent has no definitely located
oil deposits to practise on there are numerous 01
shalebeds known and actually mapped, for a thorough
trial of the method.

Students of statistics will not extract
much comfort from those relating to copper.
The more the demand expands the more ex-
pansive become the supplies. Since the
Armistice there has been a glut of the nmta ,
and the demand continues short ot the
supply. A sharp increase m price would
bring further competition from old districts
not worked out, but quiescent because of un-
payable prices. Very rarely lias a promi-
nent copper-producing district been worked
out Many have shut down when no longer
capable of competing with newer areas at
shallower levels; but they resume produc-
tion when prices are right, as they were
during the second half of the war period
Nowadays there is organised manufacture ot
huge masses of low-grade copper-bearing ores.
In the Lake Superior area there are such
bodies containing from 50 to <OO million
tons giving 201 b. to 451 b. crude copper to
the ton One “vein” is traceable for 50 miles
and assays from 51b to 101 b. copper
This merely awaits still cheaper methods.
Tn the copper welter Australia doesn t count
for more than a rushlumt in the Milky Way
A strip bordering the Pacific from Chile
through Peru and Mexico, the U.S.A., Brit-
ish Columbia, Alaska and Japan produces
nbonf 75 P.c. of current supplies. Other
active suppliers are Katanga, in South Cen-
tral Africa ; Rio Tinto, Spain ; and the Urals,
Russia.
London platinum flotations to exploit the
Transvaal discoveries involve £12,000,000 of
capital over an area of about 2000 sq. miles.
Iridium, a metal closely allied to platinum,
is produced in greater quantities in the
Transvaal than elsewhere. Dr. Wagner, the
S’African Government Geologist, expresses
confidence that the platinum industry there-
about will grow into a big thing.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: Old prospectors are set a-
dreaming by the stories from Adams River
(Tas.). osmiridium field. Roughly £5OOO of
the metal is being produced per week, and
cash buyers have already paid out close on
£lOO,OOO. The luck of the game is the same
as ever. Two men. lately arrived, hopped
into an abandoned claim and took out £lOOO
worth the first week. The Adams River
men are expecting gold to come in. If it
does it w'ill repeat the story of the Yodda
and Gira fields in Papua, where gold was
found with osmiridium long before the value
of the latter was known.

“The man I marry must he fired with en-
thusiasm.”
“Well, that's me. I're been fired from more
jobs with more enthusiasm than any
other boy I know.”
“M.G.S.” : I went down to Spencer-street
(Melb.) to meet a small daughter, and
found a military brass band, a guard
of honor composed entirely of Anzacs,
a crimson carpet and a red, brown
and azure cloud of brass-hats. The
crimson carpet had miscalculated badly,
and when the train drew in it had to lay
itself down again in a more appropriate
position. The military band, the guard of
honor and the cloud of brass-hats hastened
after it, and had only half readjusted their
pomp and dignity when the train came to
a halt. The band struck up “Annie Laurie,”
the guard clicked smartly, and a quiet gentle-
man in a neat grey suit and a tali grey hat
with a black band stepped out of his car-
riage into the scarlet, brown and azure cloud.
“Who might he be?” asked a stout woman
with a market-basket, who had go^mntrapped
amongst the crowd. “It’s Allenby, said
a policeman. “What, him that makes
the babv-food ?” asked the stout woman.
Then the victor of Armageddon drove off,
the band and the guard of honor started in
pursuit, the usual undemonstrative Austra-
lian crowd disintegrated, and I found my
small daughter standing on the carpet.

“C.M.”: The wife, our one and only five-
year-old and myself were ambling along a
bush road when Young Australia happened
on a board with “Disengaged” printed on it,
evidently lost by some motor-driver. After
a vain attempt to spell the word, he came
to me for enlightenment, and I tried to ex-
plain what it meant. Presumably I was
successful, for 1 found the board on the front
of our pram next morning.
“Ex-Dig.”: The 12,000 Australian soldiers
killed in the war whose bodies the Graves
commission has been unable to trace for
re-burial in the Australian cemeteries in
France will have a magnificent “headstone”
when the Australian War Memorial, for
which designs are now being invited, goes up
at Villers Bretonneux, scene of the fine Aus-
tralian deed that, in Foch’s words, “saved
not only Amiens but France.” Their names,
being on no other headstone, will be specially
engraved on this monument, which is to cost
£90,000; an extra £lO,OOO is set apart for
architects’ fees and expenses and the plant-
ing of trees in the approaches. All the
material with which the monument is to be
faced must come from Australia. It might
well be stipulated that the trees should be
Australian, too.
“Weka”: In one of Sydney’s outi*; sub-
urbs is a bootshop that flaunts from its high
verandah a huge golden boot. One dark
night two Uni. students set forth secretly to
acquire the trophy. There were no poles
to help them, so one climbed on the should-
ers of the other, and was striving to detach
the boot from its moorings when the local
policeman lpomed out of the midnight gloom.
The supporting student cast once glance be-
hind him, and fled; the man of law, per-
ceiving the dangling legs, quietly took his
place. With wrenches and profanity the
boot-annexer at last tore the bauble from
its place, and, descending suddenly, took
the policeman with him in a rapid fall
to the gutter. In a pool of dirty water he
had no time to marvel on the metamorphosis
of his fellow-conspirator, and the battle for
the spoils was short and decisive. As the
escaping student sped up a by-street he was
joined by another swift-running figure. “Get
the boot?” gasped the newcomer. “You bet
I did !” said the other grimly—“all over me!”
The scene closed with two disgruntled hum-
orists hastening home, and a large, dignified
policeman patrolling his beat nursing an
enormous golden boot.

“Sixenate” : A wealthy 60-year-old N.S.W.
citizen who was co-re. in a divorce ease of
a few years ago is named as respondent in
a pending action for breach, in which the
lady with the damaged heart claims £5OOO
compensation. Apropos of affluent and elderly
Lotharios, a few years ago there was one
who re-married directly the decree secured
against him by his wife had been made abso-
lute. But the new partner whom he led to
the altar wasn’t one of the numerous co-res.
in the divorce suit —it was his former wife’s
sister. The separation was immediate, how-
ever; the new wife boasted that she had
merely gone through the marriage ceremony
to avenge her sister. The taste of the gentle
sex for queer revenges is one of its remark-
able characteristics.

“Runa”: A newly-arrived Governor-
General was addressing the guests at a col-
lege function in Maoriland. After a few
introductory remarks his Ex, told the com-
pany that he stood before them as a repre-
sentative of the greatest school on earth —
Eton- —and was probably the only Etonian
with them that day. Massey’s popular
henchman, William Herries. was the first to
shatter the proud illusion with the state-
ment that he also was an Etonian. He was
followed by a burly farmer, down to see his
sons receive their prizes, who had likewise
been at Eton. Finally a Wellington tobac-
conist declared himself one of the elect. The
G.-G. mopped liis brow and decided that in
these bally new countries one never could tell
what one’s neighbor had been.
“Nakhoda” : A ease which is puzzling Mel-
bourne medieoes suggests that, although
science has plenty of data about man’s
ascent from me ape, what is going on in the
miseroseopie world is still largely a mys-
terv. A sailing ship blew into Port Phillip
the' other day with undiagnosed sickness
amongst the crew. She was eventually
cleared, but four days afterwards the mys-
terious complaint carried off a Russian mem-
ber of the crew and the ship was hastily
sent to Coventry. All that the experts can
say is that the disease is similar to typhus
and is called Brill’s disease after the New
York doctor who discovered it. If the bacillus
is ever isolated it is quite likely to prove to
be a typhoid germ grown more nasty and
vindictive in the breeding grounds of less
sanitary countries than Australia. Scarlet-
fever used to be a minor disability that
earned European children a holiday in bed
with jellies and blancmanges. After it had
been taken to China and had passed through
the bodies of the local inhabitants it returned
to its old European hosts so invigorated that
it is now- more dreaded than small-pox. The
mortality in England is 1.1 per cent.;
amongst Englishmen in China it is 18.2.
HER GOOD NIGHT.
“You look positively beautiful to-night.”
“Oh, you flatterer!”
“No —true bill. 1 had to look twice before I recognised you.”
“Inkalier”: It is not surprising that the
Australian habit of applying words indica-
tive of quality or virtue to the most repre-
hensible actions occasionally grates upon
magistrates. A Sydney beak listened with
calm understanding the other day when a
complainant! said he had been “fanned”; but
he jibbed at the victim’s assurance that he
had received “a decent punch,” and demanded
a more intelligible phrase. The man in the
box thereupon amended it to a “hard blow,”
which, doubtless, looked better on his Wor-
ship’s notes. Which recalls that a recent
witness in a divorce case, the grounds being
cruelty, was asked whether he remembered
seeing the petitioner with her eyes blackened.
“A pair of beauts!” he said simply, with
what seemed very like enthusiasm.
“Shed Hand”: During the passing of a
goods-train through the Perth transit-yard a
bag of Barcelona nuts, was jerked off a
loaded truck and lost its label. There being
no clue to its destination, a shunter carried
the bag to the office and reported the matter.
The train came from Fremantle, and officials
were soon busy on the telephone about the
find. For five days questions and answers
were exchanged between the two railway
centres, but nothing could be learned about
the owner of the bag of nuts. At last some-
body spoke from the Fremantle end hope-
fully : “Bag of bolts surplus here. What
size nuts are in your bag?” Perth shot the
queried bag into the first train bound for
the port, and passed the problem on to some-
one else.
“C.Q.” : A man had a bad turn in Denili-
quin, and the doctor whose attendance he
particularly desired was in lvew (Melb.),
190 miles away. It takes a day to get to
Deniliquin by rail and another day to get
back, but the medico left at 7.35 a.m., fixed
up his patient, and was drinking tea in his
own home that afternoon. The aerial mail-
service between Essendon and Deniliquin
did the business.
“Gidgee” : Descriptions of mean men have
supplied many picturesque phrases; but I
still recall as brightest of them all a dis-
gusted station-hand’s picture of a West o’
Darling squatter who “wouldn’t let a thirsty
dog have a drink from a mirage on his flam-
ing country.”
* * * *
•R.J.L.”: Although the newly-recruited
and reorganised Vic. police force is the target
for incessant criticism there are some con-
scientious souls in it. A few days ago a
shocking accident occurred at a brick-works
at Thornbury, a young employee having his
right leg torn from the body at the hip.
The victim was hurried to the Melbourne
Hospital, where he died the same evening.
Half an hour after the patient’s admission
to the hospital a young policeman from the
scene of the accident arrived in a taxi and
delivered to the casualty ward the dismem-
bered leg carefully wrapped up in newspaper.
His sense of duty even carried him to the
length of paying the taxi-hire himself.
“Julian”: I won-
der if anywhere
there are Christmas
sprees like w T e used
to have. During
one at Barcaldino
(Q.) in the old
days some of us
were arguing on a
pub verandah about
feats of horseman-
ship, when “Long
Mac” offered to bet
drinks for all hands
and the cook that
he would ride his
horse into the bar
and jump over an
empty hogshead
that was lying in
the middle of the
room. Barcaldine
was wild and
Avoolly in those
days, so Mac’s
offer was accepted.
The horse cleared
the cask rig h t
enough, but in the
jump back to the
footpath the rider’s
head struck the
crosspiece support-
ing the signboard.
Result, a broken
neck and a funeral.
But we had the
drinks all the same.
The publican paid
for them —and the
funeral —out of the
cheque that Long
Mac had handed
over when starting
on his jamboree.
“Ida Dawson” : Touching the proper spell-
ing and pronunciation of the Federal capital
(B 7/1 /’26). The late W. Davis \\ rigli*,
in 'his little book, says the original name
was Kamberra; and his elder sister, who
died lately, told me the same thing. The
Wright family can speak with authority,
for the father of W. Davis Wright was one
of the verv early pioneers of the Queanbeyan
district The second son, John, who is close
EVEN SPEAK THE TRUTH.
SHE ( turning down legal admirer) : “Eve
never yet heard a lawyer speak the
truth!”

of the profession. Some of us are so
unscrupulous we'd do anything to win
a case.”
to his 83rd milestone, is still hale and
hearty; he plumps for Kamberi, the a
broad and the second syllable short and
abrupt. My own father (the lately-retired
Goulburn stock-inspector) knew the district
well in his youth and had plenty of oppor-
tunities of hearing the natives pronounce the
name; he supports John Wright.

THE END OP THE TALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Rife-passes on the railways are to be the reward
of the members of the N.S.W. Leg. Council for
agreeing to abolish the Chamber.”
1 saw a man of sorrow stand
In a most gloomy pose;
An ancient staff was in his hand.
The tears ran down his nose.
“I soon shall touch four-score and ten;
But though 1 lived years more,
My griefs unshared In’ other men
Must leave me sad and sore.
“I was a stalwart of the band
Who won a railway-pass
For life to travel all the land;
But 1 was then an ass.
“The Legislative Council died
By my heroic vote;
That fact I state with honest pride,
But I am still a goat.
“The last I am of all the flock”—
His tears ran free and fast—
“l stand up like a living rock,
A beacon from the past.
“Yes, I have travelled far and wide
For neat the Psalmist’s span ;
As freely, cheaply did I ride
As any living man.
“But this remains to spoil my joy;
My race is nearly run;
I am the father of a boy—
And, oh, I love my son!
“The parsons say all flesh is grass;
And he is sixty-nine.
I cannot leave my railway pass
To any child of mine!”
A grey thrush in the blushes sang
At his recital’s close.
“It really wasn’t fair of I.ang"—
The tears ran down his nose.

“Topee”: The Yanks “te'll the world” of
their business smartness, so it may be an-
noying for them to read this par.; still, the
story must be told. The dah-lar millionaires
who visited the blacks’ camp at La Perouse
(Sydney) were so delighted with the boomer-
ang-throwing that they purchased all the
weapons they could get. Noting a shortage,
a returned soldier who happened to be pre-
sent hurried to town, and calling on an old
battalion mate, who now runs a suburban
CARATS.
"She still 'wears her hair long — it’s just like gold.”
”Um, yes, 1 know. Rolled gold,”
wood-working plant, gave him a rush order
for a few hundred boomerangs, to be delivered
at 8. the following morning. Although two
hours were lost in getting suitable models,
the goods were at the appointed place on
time, and, as they say in Sussex-street, “the
whole parcel was rapidly quitted at a marked
advance on yesterday's quotations” before the
Carinthia left the Quay at 2 p.m. ■
“P. Pawnticket”: The 44-hour week ha*
already hit below the waistcoat the numerous
persons who depend for daily sustenance upon
the Sydney restaurants; the cost of the oh!
“popular” meal (once a bob but nearer two
since the pre-war days) has been elevated
another threepence by various harassed hash-
purveyors. Yet the altruistic establishment
in Campbell-street which throws roast duck
into its offer of a three-course meal for
ninepence is still keeping its back to the
wall and its poultry on the menu. This lone
survival of the days of food plenty when
“feeds” were obtainable for as little as three-
pence seems to live at least partially on ex-
citement : almost daily the proprietor finds
it necessary to throw out diners who have
not even the ninepence, or. having dined,
prefer to be thrown out to parting with it.
» * * *
“Ivoolamarra”: Here’s a queer case of
force of habit. A few weeks ago, on the ran-
way-construction works between Brisbane
and Ivyogle, a gang of 20 men were shelter-
ing under a fly. Seventeen were ex-Diggers;
the other three had never seen a shell burst.
A regular ripsnorter of a thunderstorm was
raging, and the lightning was fierce. Sud-
denly a tree about a hundred yards away
was struck, and although the thunder which
followed was practically right on top of the
flash, every one of the IT Diggers was flat
on his face almost before it started. The
other three just stood and stared blankly at
their prostrate mates.
“Petrie”: Women crooks seldom distin-
guish themselves in Queensland, but one lady
who had won the respectful admiration of
the detectives died recently in the odor of
roast mutton and respectability as cook on
a Western station. She was a plain, hard-
featured. dowdy little woman, with a remark-
able record. A few years ago she worked
her way right along the coast, leaving
a trail of looted houses behind her. She
was the “leadliglit queen.” Then suddenly
she “turned honest,” confessing to the C.I.D.
that the pay of the only dishonesty in which
she was skilled wasn’t good _ enough; and
there was not a word to be said against her
thereafter.
* * * *
“Stellsby”: It is curious that so many
Australian-born Scots retain the guttural
and burr of their ancestors though they
themselves have
never seen Cale-
donia except in the
atlas. G. A. Max-
well, is an
example. He has
such a strong
Scotch accent that
any new arrival
from Burgooland
would probably
conclude Maxwell
hadn’t long pre-
ceded him to this
country. Now, I’m
of Scotch parent-
age, both ways. I
was born in Aus-
tralia, reared in an
atmosphere of por-
ridge and Calvin-
ism, migrated to
Scotland, and sailed
in and out of Scot-
tish ports years on
end. Yet I never
acquired the
national accent. On
the other hand, a
Scotch friend of
mine who came
here in his early
youth with his
parents became a
good Australian,
married, and when
I last saw him in-
troduced me to his
son, who at IS
years of age talks
like a n all-wool
Glaswegian. How
do you explain it?
“Louden”: Villa
names . such as
“Wywurri” and
“Nevawurri” are to
be seen almost any-
where nowadays,
but a young couple
in an eastern
suburb of Mel-
bourne have gone
one better or
worse —than either.. ‘‘Sorbite” is the com-
forting label on their dovecot.
“Ex-Dig.”: It is dangerous to take risks
with shell-shocked nerves. Alfred Burke, a
Newcastle solicitor, went to see the Zee-
brngge him, and it must have .revived old
horrors for him; later in the night he vvas
found smashed to death underneath, a bed-
thoroughly domesticated.
GRANDMA: “You girls are so useless nowadays. Why, I don't believe you know what
needles are for." „
FLAPPER: "Don't be silly, Grannie! We use them every evening in the gramophone."
room window, from which he had either
fallen or thrown himself. Not long ago some
revolver-shots fired during the progress ot a
play at the King’s Theatre, Melbourne, set
a returned soldier going: he tried to throw
himself from the gallery. My own worst
obsession is a horror of walking anywhere in
darkness; unless I can sec where I am tread-
ing there is a dreadful apprehension, persist-
ing against all reason, that even my bedroom
floort may be pitted with shell-holes.
“Herodot”: In the big prisons of Australia
tobacco and wax matches take the place of
the currency of the outside world. There is
generally a'plentiful supply of the former;
in most gaols there is an official issue ot
tobacco nowadays in addition to what may
be smuggled in. Matches, however, are much
scarcer, and this has led to the practice ot
splitting up the ordinary lucifer into four or
six or even eight smaller ones, borne pri-
soners are adepts at this, and one N. S.
Wales gaol until recently possessed a master-
craftsman who made .19 matches out of one,
each of the “pups” consisted of a portion ot
wax-strand with a tiny but strikable frag-
merit of the head attached. Much ingenuity
i s displayed in the secreting of the lucifers, so
that they will not be found during searches
of cells and clothing. A eonfinee has been
discovered with no fewer than a hundred
split-up matches which had previously sur-
vived a dozen searches for contraband.

“Michael Earle” (Vancouver) : Jury brib-
ing, with the tremendous risk involved, has
been discarded in the United States for a
more subtle, less hazardous method of in-
fluencing the good men and true. Frequently,
on the authority of a Judge in Seattle, the
weeping woman who sits beside the cleten
dant in the court-room during the trial is
not his wife, but someone rented for the occa-
sion. Or there may be a grey, old mother,
shaken with sobs, a sweetheart with w r an,
appealing face, or even a little daughter
anv of these can be leased for the day
to ‘ work on the jury’s sympathies, borne
Judges have, .refused to allow any feminine
belonging except a credentialled wife to be
present at the trial of a prisoner, and even
then the lady is required to behave herself.
“Copabella” : Great food for controversy is
being stored for our posterity in the place-
names of Australia. In one small corner
of Queensland is a group of names, not.
one of them 100. years old, each ot which
excites argument. Bundaberg, capital ot the
well-settled Burnett country, is.- One. Its
construction suggests a combination ot abo.
and German. The town's chief street is
called Bourbon, richly and royally French;
yet there are sticklers who insist that it is
Bin-bong, pure abo., and some retain that
spelling. The city council takes no sides:
it spells it both ways. The French school
derives the word from the Isle of Bourbon.
Mauritius, whence it is said the original
cane with which the district pioneered cane-
culture in Australia was imported. A tew
miles away is Bnllyard. It is never likely
to be settled whether this is the bnllyard of
a now-extinct cattle-station or an aboriginal
word that has been cockneyfied into Eng-
lish. Further away is the village and station
of Greymare, its name older than Queensland.
\ disgusted pommy was lamenting what he
regarded as the mutilation of beautiful Grey-
mere (the Grey Lake) of his youth, but an
Aussie said starkly that away back m earliest
days a grey station mare had there died ( ami
stunk for days), whereupon the name had
become fixed.
‘A Lawyer” : That par. about the offensive
behavior of parchment after a flood (B.
7/l/’26) throws light on a matter which has
always puzzled me. A woman client once
buried in her back garden —for safe keeping,
she said—in a large bottle inside a biscuit-
tin. the title deed of her house, together with
her marriage certificate and other papers.
Water got in, and she found the whole collec-
tion an evil-smelling mass of pulp, with one
document indistinguishable from another; so
she scrapped the lot, burying them in reality
this time. On her strong affidavit as to the
above facts I got another title issued. 1 fuh>
expected that the Registrar-General would
insist that she should bring what was lett
of the deed to him for identification; but il
the parchment would have rendered his office
uninhabitable, as is now suggested, there is
no wonder that he took her word for it.

“The ship’s cook (of the S.S. Cooma) attempted
to step from the wharf to the slop’s side and tell
into the river. Captain Firth, who was

, lot.hed, to his rescue. The pantryman, realuinq the

dived into the river also. — Brisbane Daila Mail.
I listened, it seemed, to a tale re-told
Of another Nancy Lee,
For here were the cook and the captain bold,
Though they altered a little that story old.
For neither was stowed in the other’s holu
When the Cooma put to sea.
’Twas the cook (maybe, with a lilting song)
To the ship came stepping free;
And he stepped so free and he stepped so long
He was lost to sight of the staring throng,
For he stepped on a tide that was running strong
Past the Cooma out to sea.
The captain never a moment stayed,
But a mighty leap leaped he;
And quite a remarkable splash he made
As, with never a thought for his golden braid.
He hustled to succor the cook who’d strayed
From the Cooma to the sea.
Then came another courageous man
To the cheering from the cpiay,
A paladin of the pantry clan,
Who shouted encouragement as lie ran
And dived as only the daring can
From the Cooma to the sea.
So here’s a health to such hardy crews,
And could you beat these three?
Or a spunkier pantryman could you choose?
Though (whisper it, pray, if you tell the news)
’Twas the cook . not the captain, he hated to lose,
Ere the Cooma put to sea.

LFOR THE BULLETIN.
“When questioned, defendant said: ‘I gave her a
punch, and I will give her some more. I will do time
for her. I love her.’ ” —Age.
My precious pet, I love you so
That I incessantly desire
With yearning heart and blood on fire
My love by methods new to show.
But, ah, how weakly blows reveal
The adoration that I feel!
Though I may seize you by the hair,
Detaching portions from the roots,
And jump on you with heavy boots
When I have flung you down the stair,
It seems to me a feeble fashion
Of demonstrating amorous passion.
Think you volcanic love like this
Can be expressed in puling song?
No! Give to me a batten strong,
I’ll show what true devotion is.

Love is not shown in words, but deeds.

Lord Allenby’s visit to Australia has re-
called a story of “Fighting Charlie” Cox. That
jeneral and his first Light Horse were pot-
tering about the Jordan Valley without
much cart how they looked when a message
arrived that Allenby was coming to inspect
them. Cox made his tnen a speech ; he told
them to spruce up, behave like trained sol-
diers when paraded, “and”—his voice took
on a note pf . anxiety—“for God’s sake don’t
call me Charlie.”
By wearing his hat in the Reps, last week
ox-speaker Watt reminded members that
they have the right to be tiled when sitting
down if they please. The practice has fallen
into disuse. Members who don’t wear hats
hnd it awkward if they have to ask a ques-
tion during a division. They must keep
their places and be “covered.” Vic. Speakers
have allowed members to hold Parliamentary
notice-papers over their heads as substitutes
tor hats while they jerked out their queries
Fveil the best-disciplined Parliamentarians
have found it difficult to restrain themselves
from smiling at such antics.
T rF 011 ?®,*- ,Tolm ’ was the popular name for
.1. Connck, just dead in Adelaide at 73, and
he had well earned it. He was of the Gee-
long and VV arrnambool district as a boy, and
always said that it was the Burke and Wills
tragedy that attracted him to the Cooper
with cattle at the age of 20. About 1875 he
opened a stock route from Queensland to
8.A., being already part owner of Nappa
Merrie station in the Q. far west. He ulti-
mately owned 2000 square miles in the dis-
trict, and bred cattle, sheep and horses. He
had a bad motor-accident in Adelaide about
10 years back, and had been in indifferent
health since.
Australia's most persistent tripper, Percy
Hunter, who is to leave his job as Director
of Immigration to become Australian man-
ager of the Pacific Cable Board, was a press-
man before the N.S.W. Government sent him
to England in the ’nineties. He has been
there, off and on, ever since as an agent of
various sorts ; first, for the N.S.W. and sub-
sequently the Commonwealth Government
The salary of his new job is £2OOO a year'
and his future H.Q. will be Melbourne; but
if he doesn’t manage to find it imperative to
take a trip to England or some other remote
part at least once a year on the Board’s
business, it will be because he has grown
tired of travelling.
.James Garfield Bayley, the new Chairman
of Committees in the Federal House, was a
schoolmaster before he became member for
Oxley (Q.). His father, a parson who
served a term as President of the Congre-
gational Union, sprinkled the names of the
great amongst his large family, and Garfield
numbers amongst his brothers a Shakspeare,
a Eincoln and a Grant.
The Royal (English) Air Force has a big
exhibit at the Dunedin Exhibition purport-
mg to show the development of aviation from
the comical contraptions of Cayley down to
the latest all-metal bomber. In this exhibit
full credit is given to lAlienthal and Pilcher
for their glider exploits in the late ’nineties
and to A. V. Roe, Colonel Cody, the Wrights,
Bieriot and the other pioneers of power-
flight 22 years ago. But there is not a sign
that the R.A.F. ever heard of Lawrence
Hargrave, of Sydney, who mastered some of
the knottiest problems of mechanical.flight
m 1884, and w x ho in 1900 handed over to the
Wrights the whole result of years of patient
research and experiment. They asked him
to sell his patents, but he told them he had
never patented anything. His work was for
the benefit of mankind.
“Ldinhill”: Johnny Jones, mentioned (B,
7/l/’26) in connection with the genesis of
Union S. S. Cos., w T as otie of those pioneer
Maoriland settlers who laid the foundations
of large fortunes decades before there was
any organised attempt at colonisation. Jones,
who has been variously described as a whaler
and a dealer, drifted on the scene in the
early ’thirties. He “bought” a lot of land
at Waikouaiti from the Maoris, and posses-
sion thereof made him, two or three decades
later, one of the leading citizens of Dunedin
in the matter of wealth. He built a very
fine mansion which later became the home
of the Dunedin Club. He took a leading
part in' the formation of the Otago Harbor
S. N. Cos. in the ’sixties, one of the first craft
owned by the co. being a little paddle steamer,
the Golden Age, which plied up and down
the harbor. It was this “fleet” on which the
great Union line was built.
Justice Isaacs returned to a chamber in
which he was no stranger wdien he occupied
the Speaker’s chair „in the Federal Parlia-
ment while members of the tenth House were
being sworn in. For nine years he sat there
as a country member of the Leg. Assembly
and for two-thirds of that period he was
Law Minister under Patterson, Turner
(twice) and Peacock. Then lie was Federal
member for lndi for nearly six years, and
bad a snort innings as Attorney-General be-
lore being sent to the High Court bench 20
years ago. As an intense young Radical
-Liberal, he allied himself with Turner and
1 eaeock in. pushing through progressive
measures, and the people of Victoria showed
now they appreciated his services by send-
ing him high on the list to the Federal Con-
vention,,. which sat in the same chamber.
Only a few of the old familiar faces of his
Parliamentary days were present in the House
on his latest appearance there, but he had
no difficulty in picking out three fellow Privy
Councillors—-Hughes, Watt; and Bruce.
News, that Zane Grey, the.Amurrican novel
ist, is approaching, and that he has been
lured by reports of unique big-fish sport
offered by the Shaky Islands, is causing a
stir in certain quarters in M.L. The Mako
Shark Club, of
Russell, in the Bay
of Islands, will vie
with the supporters
of Mayor Island,
further down the
coast, in the Bay of
Plenty, in produc-
ing the biggest fish
possible for his
benefit. Launches
have already been
set aside to carry
his party to the
most likely fishing-
grounds, and it now
only remains for
the sharks and
swordfish to rise to
the occasion.
Lord ALLEN BY
of megiddo, note
giving Australia
the once-over.
The saving grace of humor has not shown
itself up to date in the new Federal Parlia-
ment. The one ray in a dull week came from
an old hand. Minister for Customs Pratten
was enlightening the House on the cultivation
of cassava in Queensland. The Queensland
Government had sent an expert to Java to
study the latest methods and was also in pos-
session of a report which was too frightfully
confidential to be divulged. “Is it a fact,”
queried W. M. Hughes, “that the report
recommends the crossing of the cassava with
the cassowary?” The natives of the West
Indies, by the way, long ago discovered the
properties in cassava which are now attract-
ing the interest of petrol users in this coun-
try. By masticating the root with their
teeth and fermenting the residue they manu-
factured booze with a very special kick in
it—power alcohol, in fact.
The talk of spats and the joke played on
Alf Jones, Queensland’s Minister of Mines,
by Theodore at Wembley, recalls the occa-
sion when Australia’s noblest and best rolled
up to the King’s garden-party at Bucking-
ham Palace in their myriads, and most of
’em arrayed in spats. When the monarch
appeared in a frocker. but without spats, their
horror, as Ethel M. Deli would say, can
better be imagined than described. Next
morning the royal gardeners swept up above
kOO of the boot-cuffs from under the oi'na-
mental shrubs and hedges.
The four-and-twenty sailors
That stood between the decks
Were four-and-twenty millionaires
With rings about their necks
isn t exactly how the nursery rhyme describes
the fairy ship, but it nearly fits the Finnish
barquentine Feyell, which berthed in
Melbourne the other day. Four of its ap-
hr are alleged to be the sons of
millionaires, and the rest are scions of
wealthy business men in the republic that
used to groan and grow rich under the
Kussian heel. Last year the vessel was to
haie gone to the knacker’s yard, but some-
body suggested sending her round the world
again with this gilded crew. A tutor keeps
the lads busy at their pothooks in their
leisure time. One of them, who may be
found any time knocking old paint off the
ship's side with a hammer, is the son of
the biggest woollen-mill owner in Sweden
and the father of another is the Anthony
Hordern of those parts.
Frank Rolleston, the Timaru (M.L.) law-
yer who becomes Minister of Health and De-
fence in the Shivery Dominion, is a son of
Dismal Bill,” that fine old crusted Tory
who, as Superintendent of the Province,
helped to make Canterbury what it is. Poli-
tics run in the family, but Francis Joseph's
chance did not come till four years ago, when
he beat, a not-very-impressive Labor man
for the Timaru seat. Like his ponderous
parent, .-Rolleston has proved a restive poli-
tical bedfellow, and if it wefe not that he
generally wanders into the right lobby, when
the bell rings the party would rather have
his room than his company. But he has
ability and character.
William Downie Stewart, who goes back
to the M.L. Ministry after a two years’ fur-
lough in search of health, will be welcomed
by men of all parties. He is the plea-
santest-spoken Minister the Reformers have
put forward, and as the overlord of Customs
showed a concern for the manufacturing in-
dustries that was in contrast to the attitude
ol other members of his party. He is the
one member of the Cabinet with a deep know-
ledge of political principles and history. In
collaboration with Professor Rossignol he
wrote "State Socialism in New Zealand.'’
and he produced a very scholarly preface to
Andre Siegfried’s English edition of "Dem-
ocracy in New Zealand.” lie is a lawyer,
has been Mayor of Dunedin, and seriously
damaged a frail constitution by doing his bit
in the Big Scrap.
While not much is heard about him out-
side the Shivery Islands—and not a great
deal there L red Furkert, who recently got
the right to put C.M.G. after his name,
probably wields more power and does the
wielding more autocratically than any other
individual in the small Dominion. He is
not only Under-Secretary for Works, but
also chief engineer and his own principal
technical adviser. Latterly, as chairman of
pj e Highways Board, he has become boss
ot the roads. _ Largely owing to his strong
grip on the reins, the liighly-important busi-
ness of hydro-electric development, which
ought to be in the hands of a separate
department, has all along been run as a
sub-department with Furkert in charge. A
\\ estcoaster by birth, hi' started near the
bottom of the ladder, and has climbed most
ot the way through industry and ability.
His installation as a departmental deity
dates from the taking-over of the portfolio
py Loates, who has a keen nose for back-
bone and nerve.
Picked by the C.S.R. from amongst 400
applicants to act as director of its central
research laboratory, Dr. R. W. Harman pro-
vides yet another example of the way Maori-
land fails to retain its brainiest University
men. _ He was a student of Auckland Uni‘
entering from Hamilton High School with a
scholarship. After absorbing all the science
he could find in Auckland and graduating as
D.Se., lie went to the Great Smoke and got
his B.Sc. (Bond.) under Professor Donnan,
researches in regard to solutions of sodium
silicate gaining him much kudos. The best
Auckland could offer him on his return was
a job on the teaching staff of the Grammar
School.
Mizzle : Bill Carroll, the Senator who
will succeed Drake-Brockman at the end of
.June, has a habit of shutting his eyes when
m speech. He will hold forth like a blind
orator, and then suddenly celebrate arrival
at the point ot his outburst by having a
look at the world. During the recent cam-
paign he failed to get a full-sized meeting
at one country centre, so contented himself
by having an informal chat outside the
township’s pub. Bill got well into his
themes, drawing well-formed sentences, his
eues as tightly closed as a day-old pup’s.
1 resently he opened his optiies—but his
audience had disappeared.
George Roberts, who spent a while in the
Vic. Parliament 20-odd yeftrs ago, will be
longer remembered as Sergeant-Major of the
doth and bth Battalions. lie was 48 when
he went into the Rig - Scrap, in which he
was wounded, and
lie put up a fine re-
cord of useful ser-
vice before that in
the meningitis camp
at Bendigo. On
his return to Aus-
tralia in 1917 his
active soldiering
was over; but he
played a fine part
in the conscription
campaign.
A. W. WILKIE,
director of the
Melbourne Zoo-
logical Gardens.
I’. J. Rae, who seemed to have the appoint-
ment in his pocket, may not, after all, occupy
the pleasant little home surrounded by the
nnest garden in Victoria which goes with the
Job ot Melbourne’s Botanical Director. The
official bodies concerned in the appointment
are pushing each its own nominee. The
Botanic Bardens advisory committee wants
u • ?*: y 9 e ' at present perspiring in Rabaul;
the Minister of Lands would like to see E.
L. Pescott, who tests seeds for the Agricul-
tural Department, in the .job; another appli-
cant. D. Herbert, who lectures about plants
at Queensland University, is also in the run-
mng. Probably the State Cabinet will be
called upon to give its casting vote.
THE CERBERA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Lazzarini waved his hands and thundered,
and on his broad breast swayed violently the beau-
tiful gerbera that he never fails to wear to the
House.” —S. M. Herald.
In Parliament are factious squalls and blasts of
heated air
That eddy round the Treasury bench and make the
Speaker’s chair
A place for nobody to crave who seeks a pleasant
rest,
And agitate the gerbera on Lazzarini’s breast.
(The gerbera! Presumably some kind of floral
herb.
The office Webster only gives two words that start
with “gerb,”
An “ornamental firework” one, and one a “jumping
rat”—
And nobody upon his breast would flaunt a thing
like that.)
The idiotic questions and the sillier answers fly,
They hand the puerile gibe about and swap the
naked lie.
The wrathful words, the insults rude around the
Chamber float,
And still the dainty gerbera decks Lazzarini’s coat.
(The gerbera! The gerbera? It leaves me in a fog.
I wish I had for reference a seedsman’s catalogue.
1 never was botanical, and in my artless song
May Heaven send I haven’t got the word accented
wrong!)
Joe Chamberlain would scarce have seemed without
his orchid dressed,
And glittering Dizzy loved, they tell, the homely
primrose best.
It’s roses set with thorns for most who’rs in the
Labor swim,
But Lazzarini’s made his choice: the gerbera for
him.
(The gerbera ! The gerbera ! I thought at first, I
own,
’Twas some new kind of swastika or else a precious
stone.
Mill it be Labor’s symbol? The contingency com-
pels
A niild inquiry how it looks and also how it smells.)

THE WHISkV
THAT ALWAYS LEAVES
A PLEASANT MEMORY
ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
' * ■X-
“Desist” : If dysentery is again under dis-
cussion I offer my experience. In 1921 and 1922
1 paid the bills and was given up as incurable by
two Macquarie-street (Sydney) doctors. I then lived
on milk, wheat, lentils, split-peas, lettuce and water.
Inside It days I was 24-carat, and have remained so
without the diet.
Loloata : At the island of Loloata,. com-
monly called Lion Island by the sturdy Austral-
Papuans who are building a smelting industry at
Bootless Inlet (Papua), the sea-snake is seen
in considerable num-
bers beyond high-water
mark. The reptile is
usually the greenish-
black and diity-white
banded variety, though
I have seen several
other kinds. Brown
Brother fears the sea-
snake more than he
does its land-cousin,
and native gossip is
full of the sudden
passings of friends and
relatives through its
bite. In Moresby the
horror has been seen
crawling on the stone-
scape in front of the
old post-office, a build-
ing about a hundred
yards from the water
and 40ft. up a small
hill. This snake has a
tail like an eel, and
sometimes grows to
nearly 6ft. in length.
It has fangs exactly
like the deadly crawler
of the grass-plains, but
on land is slugish and
travels slowly, and is
easily killed. The old
wharf at Moresby may,
in the north-West mon-
soon, be trusted to
provide a perfectly
good specimen of
hokoTcreva —the Motu
name for the reptile.
It is extremely fond
of sun-baking; I have
seen as many as 37 of
the honors enjoying
their midday siesta
among the toots and broken coral fully 200 yards
distant from their natural element.
“ Wanchai” : Do nettles in any other part
of Australia attain the growth and viciousness thev
reach in and around Orbost (Vic.)? All along the
flats, where the Snowy Riv e r overflows its banks
and spills an incomparably rich silt, I have seen
enormous growths. They take the characteristics
of vines, in some cases climbing to a height of
20ft. on a tree trunk before reaching across to
entwine another bole. Very often the,distance from
tip to stem of a plant is more than 40ft. The
severity of their sting is in proportion to their
growth. Many a good horse (and horses seem
particularly sensitive to their sting), maddened by
the pain, has died in agony. Providentially there
is a ready remedy. If bracken-fern fronds be rubbed
(quickly over the affected areas, their sap gives instant
relief, and recovery is certain if the animal is not
allowed to go into water.
“Shoveller’’: A wildly amusing argument
has been started in England by the death of one
J. R. Oollison, who claimed that he was responsible
for the introduction of rabbits toAAustraliaa —a claim
that prompted a G. J. Thatcher to remark in the
voice of one who is grieved at the attempt to rob
his family of glory that in 1863 his father liberated
some rabbits he had taken to Victoria at the request
of sportsmen who wanted something to shoot. The
grateful Victorians, he added, presented Dad with
lIE'D SEEN TO THAT.
‘‘Shay, oV flcr, what's numbersh your house?''
“Don't worry 'bout that, ol' man. Tt’sh on th' door ”
a medal in token of their appreciation—material
of the medal uhmentioned. Actually the rabbit’s
Australian history goes back to the year one. In
an inventory of the livestock of the original settle-
ment, made by Phillip three months after the land-
ing at Sydney Cove, five rabbits are mentioned—
three of them the property of the Governor, the other
two the property of members of his staff. Probably
no one man was responsible for giving the undesir-
able immigrant its start. In the days when vessels
used to carry livestock for slaughter during the
voyage, hutches of rabbits were often carried, and
it is quite possible that a few survived the whole
voyage and were released in Australia by well-
meaning enthusiasts. It is certain that the children
of early settlers brought with them some of their
pets, and equally certain that several of those people
who in the early days tried to transplant the
English manorhouse, with all its associations, into
the Australian bush stocked up their “preserves”
for sporting purposes. Holt, for instance, when he
built the Warren, now vanished, near Marrickville
(Sydney), released rabbits on his estate, and as
late as 1879 a man named Cleeve took action at
Parramatta against trespassers who were using
ferrets to capture his rabbits. It was not-'till 1883
that the Rabbit Act, the first declaration of, war', was
passed in N. S. Wales.
* . *• *
“Parama” : It is reported that some forms
of paralysis are being cured by inoculation with
malaria germs. Direct inoculation certainly has
not had any such effect on the natives of New Guinea
and other islands, where I have known paralytics
who were great sufferers from malaria, being so help-
less that they could not even move a hand to keep
the mosquitoes away. There is; however, one white
man in New Guinea who swears that malaria cured
him of asthma, to which he had been a martyr
for voars in Sydney before going north. I’ve known
others declare that the disease cleared rheumatism
from their systems. Personally I’m sceptical.
* * * *
“Witenhana”: If “cockatoo” is abo. and
can be connected with “kabaktua” in the Malay,
“Serintan” (B. 3/12/’25) will find his link between
Sanskrit and abo. to be Maori. M.L. birds of the
parrot and similar species are the kaka, kakakura,
kakapo and kakariki, while “ika kaka” would be the
Maori for parrot-fish, for which he gives the Malay
“ikan kakaktua.” Rigg’s dictionary of the Sunda,
a commonly-used widespread language of the Malay
Archipelago, shows a host of words that are pure
Maori. All the leading authorities Fornander,
Percy Smith, Tregear, Elsdon Best and Newman—
agree that the Maori came from India, through the
Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Bali, Timor and
Papua to the Pacific, and that his language is an
ancient pre-Vedie Sanskrit. What has puzzled them
is that, in spite of the nearness of these places to
Australia, no sign of the Maori has been found on
the island continent. “Serintan” may have found
the first trace of the influence on abo. of some
dropped colony diverted from the main Maori migra-
tion to the east. Similar dropped colonies exist
to the present day among the Nagas of Assam,
in Papua, in Timor and Pima, and- at Mantawai and
Pulo Nais, off the coast of Sumatra*
“Mars" : Like “Jaekoroo,” I left France as
a t.b. rase. On arriving home I was sent to a
sanatorium. The atmosphere. was similar to that of
all other sanatoiia one unceasing discussion of
temps, night-sweats, kxss of weight, colored phlegm,
and a hundred and one other symptoms of the disease.'
As may be imagined, such conditions were very
favorable to the march of the germs. Leaving the
military sanatorium, 1 sought a cure in a private
institution. Situated in the mountains, it was an
ideal place for the fresh-air treatment. One part
of the treatment was a cold shower or wash every
morning’. This was strictly enforced, while such a
thing as a patient having a hot bath was unheard of
■ —in fact, we were warned that hot baths were
injurious to t.b.’s. About half a mile away a
brother-specialist conducted a t.b. sanatorium on
totally different lines —there the cold shower was
optional, but at least one hot bath a week was
compulsory. Yet both institutions got results. Cer-
tainly patients died, but at both places a proportion
regained health. Despite all the talk about finding
a suitable climate, I am of the opinion that if a
sufferer is cured the arresting of the disease is
due chiefly to the resisting-power of the patient.
M hat suits one person may not suit another,
“Jackeroo” went out west and was cured. 1 tried
the great open • spaces and was brought home a
physical wreck. I then took the sun-cure in my
yard, within two miles of the G.P.O., and
within 18 months I was back at my job, my weight
having increased from lost, to 14ist. My treat-
ment consisted of baring my chest to the sun for
three hours every day. Soon my chest was tanned
a deep brown, and ever since I have been practically
normal. I attribute my cure to the sun, yet there
are some t.b. sufferers who would get little if any
relief from a course of sun-baths. Everything rests
with the individual. My advice to t.b. sufferers
is: Don’t bo afraid of the disease. Give your body
the chance to build up its strength, and v r ou will
get the upper hand of your trouble.
* * * *
“Sucre”: There is nothing in our fauna
records to support “Slam’s” (B. 24/12/’25) suppo-
sition that the dingo’s great-great-grandfather wan
dered down from the plains of Asia to Australia in
Pliocene times. There is a record, however, that
the First Fleet on its voyage to Australia took
aboard at Santa Cruz half a dozen puppies. They
were the canine pioneers of this country. The
first “kill” by wild dogs recorded in Australia was
in May,; 1788. Everything points to the Santa
Cruz puppies being the progenitors of our dingo.
Captain John Piper (Piper’s Point bears his name)
brought the first collies in 1812. Our sheep-dog of
to-day traces its origin to them.
* * * *
“Nitric”: A queer coincidence occurred
the other day in a Queensland country town. A
man broke his arm -whilst cranking a car. He
went to the nearest store and rang up his wife. On
arriving home he found that the sudden noise of
the telephone bell had caused his young son to
fall out of bed and break his arm.
“Beety”: Two sons of a Quorn (S.A.) farmer
had an argument about the power of a Stockwhip.
In order to settle matters, one of them, who was
something of an expert, wagered that he would cut
the head off a beer bottle first try-. The wager was
accepted, and with a well-directed cut the head
of the bottle was removed. But with consequences
quite unlooked for —it struck the onlooking brother
in the fleshy part of the leg with such fordfe as
to make a nasty gash, necessitating a hurried visit
to the doctor.

HARRISON’S ORUSHINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Flashes the sun on the white-ribbed rock,
Glowing with scorn on the Sapless trees
That seem to shrink while mirages mock
At sorrows and thirsts and maladies.
Turning the windlass, raising his ore,
Tipping his bucket of bullock hide,
Harrison toils, while the stampers roar,
Back in the hills on the Nation’s Pride.
Soon he shall know what the plates declare
And whether his star is false or true;
He'll revel and spend or stitch and spare
As soon as he gets his crushing through.
First I saw him in ’ninety-eight
Working a show called the Golden Fleece.
Its reef was faulted with barren slate;
The crows held an option on all his lease.
Hopeful and happy, with purpose and grit
He hammered and dug while the light was good ;
Rare was his wisdom and sharp his wit
While flames danced up from the gimlet wood.
“The reef makes better at depth,” he said,
“My luck should change in a week or two.
I’ll doss in the town on a feather-bed
As soon as I get my crushing through.”
Caught on the tide of the Slate Well rush,
Buffeted far in the dust and heat,
Losing my swag in the frantic crush,
Seeking a way for a safe retreat,
Broken and spent in the noon I crawled
Into the shade of a bulloak-tree,
When Harrison’s voice through the dust-clouds
called,
Bringing a gleam of the past to me.
With pride he bellowed, “I’ve pegged my show
Right on the south of the Roaring Flue.
Come to the tent and I’ll take you in tow ;
We’ll pinch till we get one crushing through.”
MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
'"By fho way, old man, didn’t I meet you in Cairns f”
‘'No—never been in Queensland in me life.”
“Neither hare I—we must be two entirely different people, what?”
Once in a lean year, weary and weak,
Doing a cheerless famine tramp,
I passed, on the way to Denver’s Peak,
Phe t ™ kcd r el laims ° f a "b'bng-camp
Forsaken long by the roving crowd,
forgotten since by the world that hives
Mhere trumpets blare and the drums beat loud
‘ men i'' e ClaZy j nd crowded bves;
And 1 f ; here ’ a . lone °? a dum P. b\ sat ’
DoHymg stone of a greenish hue,
Mith corks a-swing from his old felt hat-
Just putting a sample crushing through.”
"V** “ .« bor.
And hope shone true in his earnest eyes.
1 Anfplarted^th^ b WL^« j ° y
“I’ve got it at last!” he proudly mid—
tur,!
Where .tA-A
lie’ll hear the fall of a hundred stamps—
The lode is wide in the Silver Dew.
Ah, no more sorrows and no more tramps
As soon as I get this crushing through!’'
The years toiled on and the gold was won
Till ’weights were harder than health to find;
And many an old wreck sought the sun
Where the sea-breeze heals and the skies are
kind.
But Harrison scorned to turn his back
On toil, while the prize was just in sight
In a show, ten miles from the Feysville track,
That he called the Great Australian Bight.
He built on a certain two-ounce yield;
But when I reckoned his prospect blue,
He said “I’ll never forsake the field
Till I get this blasted crushing through!”
From claim to claim, in a fruitless quest,
He marched through the seasons bleak and lean.
Till every field in the Golden West >
The clouds of his pick-stirred dust had seen.
The names of his shows are listed long
On the dusty records filed away
In a Mines Department cabinet strong,
To moulder there till the Judgment Day.
He left a reef on the Saxon King
To find the lode on the Irish Stew,
Which had to merge in the Highland Fling
In order to get the crushing through.
But now he works on the Lark, which soon
Should send his credit high up the scale;
His life is late in its afternoon
And at times his eyesight seems to fail.
He gympies away at the stubborn face
That yields each day to the fracteur shocks ;
The mill-feed grows at the dusty brace
Where the sun strikes fire on the white-ribbed
rocks.
I trust the mill on the Nation’s Pride
May win him release, long overdue —
A term of rest where the surf sweeps wide—
As soon as it puts his crushing through!

There is a considerable difference in the wear of
tyres on Australian roads—and it’s not long before
a motorist begins to realise that tyre value is only
determined by the mileage delivered. Tens of
thousands of motorists test out various makes of
tyres _on the road __ and invariably they come to
the conclusion that for satisfaction and economy it
pays to fit Australian made
Dll
LO
It’s the quality and remarkable wear that is built
into these dependable tyres that ensures so many
thousands of miles of travel without a cut or chip
showing on the covers-and without the slightest
trouble. Such is “Dunlop” service. You can
obtain it at no extra cost—simply by specifying
“Dunlop” when buying from your garage.

J A. SAFE. Prop.
“Wang” ; Reginald, anew arrival, bought
a piece of land near the station where we graft, and
embarked upon the trade of poultry-farmer. He
knew nothing about fowls, so we determined to
give him a hand. After a battle with hawks, foxes
and egg-thieves Reginald brought to maturity a few
pullets, which he reckoned would lay the foundations
of his fortunes. They laid something, certainly,
but. one night their owner came over to our hut
and expressed disappointment with their achievements.
“Not much bigger than pigeon’s eggs,” he told us
gloomily. “That’s not much good t’ you,” remarked
Bill, our hard case. “P'raps ycr don’t use th’
right kind of feed for ’em. Yorter use some of that
patent egg-producer the boss here uses. After a bit
yorter get eggs as big as footballs from ’em. I’ll
get yer some t’ try.” Next evening three of us
strolled over to Reginald’s place armed with a
quantity of pollard mixed with treacle, and half a
dozen turkey’s eggs. “Feed ’em on this,” said Bill,
handing the poultry-squatter the boom-food. Next
evening Reginald came over to our hut with joy
in his eyes, and six turkey’s eggs in a bag. “By
Jove!” he said, “that stuff’s started them going
already. Look at the eggs.” We looked, and mur-
murmed our congratulations. “Keep on feedin’ ’em
with it,” counselled Bill, handing over another
supply of the preparation. Early next morning Bill
rode over to Reginald’s before daylight with three
emu's eggs. That same night Reginald burst into
our hut more elated than ever. “That stuff’s mar-
vellous—look at these, chooms,” and he held Bill’s
oblations before us. The joke ended there, owing
to the impossibility of securing dinosaur’s eggs;
but for a long time Reginald went about with a
perplexed look. The eggs had got back to their
original size.

“Nikko”: Maoriland. which, owing to its
generous water-supply, is being widely electrified in
the country districts, is discovering that the new
installation is liable to carry a kick. Numbers of
valuable animals have been lost through contact with
fencing-wire which has become charged, and the other
day an elderly man and a child of six were killed
at almost the same time in different parts of a farm
from the same trouble. Now the layman who has
gone in for up-to-date devices on the farm is
cautiously opening gates in preference to taking
a short cut through the paddock fence.
“Darnley”: On the east side of Murray
Island there is a stone called Dopem. Dopem was
once a woman, and this is her sad story. On the
opposite side of the island there lived a company
of lvris-Kris (locust) girls; also a number of Ti-Neur
(sunbird) girls. One day, before going out fishing
on the reef, they made a kop-maori to cook some
ager (a native tuber). After they had gone off,
leaving the food to roast in its earthen oven, Dopem
happened to stroll along, and, seeing the mound,
became inquisitive. Glancing round to see that no
one was about, she uncovered the layer of sand and
removed the best of the contents. When the girls
A TIME-SAVER.
YARRUM: “Mine want you buy it bell, boss, put alonga old grey
marc; find it that phella quick.”
Boss: “I can get a little bell for half a crown you can hear half
a mile away, or a big one for five bob you can hear two
miles away.”
YARRUM: “Get it little phella, boss; big phella ioo plurry far to
walk.”
returned hungry after their excursion, they hurried
to the kop-maori, to find that only the poorest
part of the food remained. They cooked their fish,
but did not touch what was left of the ager. Next
day they made another kop-maori, and went off
fishing as before. When they returned it was to
find once more that their cupboard w'as bare. Then
they decided to leave one girl to watch, telling
her that she must conceal herself in the bush and
let them know what happened. Dopem came again,
and the watcher saw her carry away all the care-
fully-prepared cooked food. When the sentry's com-
panions returned she told them the story.' “Very
well,” said they, “to-morrow only a few of us will go
to the reef, the others must stop here.” Those who
were left made their preparations, sharpening up their
double-pointed spears and getting out the stone gabba-
gabba clubs. Dopem was seen walking along the beach,
and, coming to the place where the kop-maori had
been made, she began to remove the sand. There
was a sudden whizz of spears and out rushed the
angry girls brandishing their clubs. Falling upon
the raider, they killed her, and then rolled the
body into the sea. But instead of going right out,
it floated into the next bay. The avengers hurled
it out again, but it drifted round to the beach at
an adjoining village. The girls pushed it forth again,
till, slowly travelling round, it came at length to
Karog, the former home of Dopem, where it turned
into the stone you now’ see. The girls, satisfied, left
the body and went into the bush, and at a creek,
Lakob, they placed a mound of stones and called it
Lag (the mosquito). That is the place where zogo
is made for the mosquito; it will be Shown you by
old Passi any time you like to visit Murray Island.
“Aek F. C.”: Judging from the account
given me by an old-timer, Kerang (Vic.) was a
dangerous place for inebriates 60 or 70 years ago.
The district swarmed with wild pigs, which would
invade the township at night-time and consume any-
thing and everything available. After several col-
lapsed drunks had lost ears and other outlying
portions of their anatomy, the citizens used to
shadow all sozzled persons after dark. Those who
showed no inclination or ability to go home safely
were finally collected, given knock-out drinks and
put to sleep on the counters of the stores, where
it was reckoned they would be out of reach of
the carnivorous marauders. My old-timer, who is shy
one ear, mentioned that he fell from a counter one-
night when the pigs were in.
* * * *
“Centre”; Does the crow hold trial by
jury? Attracted ny an unusual clamor from a lot
of these black fiends, I managed to get close
enough without disturbing them to see what they
were doing. I counted 14'in a ring, in the centre
of which fluttered another one, apparently loudly
protesting against something- or other of which his
fellows were jointly accusing him. Each time he
tried to make a bolt he was stopped, his last
attempt bringing about a general attack. There
was a wild beating of wings, loud and queer crow-
sounds such as I had never heard before, and then
silence. Flying low r , the 14 drew rapidly away.
The other remained on the ground, dead, as 1
discovered when I went over and examined it,
with its head pecked to pieces.
* * ■* *
“Bokeen”: We were camped on the Castle-
reagh (N.S.W.), and caught a young wild pig, which
we skinned like a sheep and hung near the camp.
Cutting a forequarter into chops, we fried them in
lard in the camp oven,
but the meat proved
so tough that we had
to throw it away and
borrow a quarter of
mutton. This we fried
in the pork fat. About
dusk a boundary-rider
cantered by on a road
whence the pig was
plainly visible. A n
hour afterwards he
came back with the
station owner and a
jackeroo. They came
toi the camp, where
the firelight flickered
on the hanging carcase,
and bluntly accused us
of sheep-stealing. We
mildly pointed out that
it was pig they saw',
and also described it
as the tenderest and
juiciest pork we had
ever eaten. A dispute
arose on this point,
the visitors declaring
that no wild pig W'as
eatable unless stalled
for a couple of months.
To refute this, we fished
out of the camp-oven
a small mutton-chop,
which, being fried in
pig-fat, smelled like
pork, and asked them
to taste it. They were
so delighted that they
bought half the pig for
301 b. of sugar, which
was delivered next
morning while we were
away from camp. Some
days later, we W'ere not
surprised to hear that
even the boundary-
rider’s dogs could rot:
tear that pig up.
“KHz”: In the nor’-west of W.A. nail-
files grow on trees. Break a leaf off the sandpaper-
tree and you have as good a toilet article as is
provided in the best of manicure sets. The tree
is short and stubby, Dever reaching more than 4ft. in
height. Motor-car drivers use the leaves for clean-
ing dirty electrical contacts and also for preparing
patches before mending punctures.
“Gouger”: Every northern abo. father
living in the wild state trains his son on Spartan
principles. From his infancy he is encouraged to
show a spirit of fearlessness and is educated in the
endurance of hardships. All his- pastimes have the
object of securing efficiency in his later life and
cultivating in him a stoical endurance of pain. Many

“I say, Secretary, where's the judge? Lie's put ‘ First-prise Cow' on the pen my

of the initiation ceremonies when the lad is merging
into manhood have been thought out with the one
stern object in view. The youngsters are gashed
with shell-knives across the body; ashes and grease
are then rubbed into the wounds, which leave ridged
scars—marks of honor denoting endurance under
pain. The youngsters are taught to laugh at one
another’s hurts, and the injured one must laugh the
loudest. Some northern tribes scar their children by
holding a coal-hot ftrestick to their skin at different
spots, forming a pattern of blisters. The cartilage
of the nose is pierced by thrusting through it a
needle-pointed bone. Wide fires are lit and a few
green bushes thrown over the red-hot coals. The
children must walk across the fires and never so
much as wince. Hunger and thirst, heat and cold
must be endured without a murmur. Only the fit
survive under the hard conditions of life; and if
ever men were trained to fitness these are.
* * * * .
“J.H.” : The scintillating glory of the satin
bower-bird is fast disappearing from the remnants
of our Queensland coastal scrubs. The glorious
regent, however, being more adaptable to his
changing conditions, survives in some districts, and
has become something of a connoisseur in orchard-
fruits, a fact not likely to prolong his existence.
On the Blackall Range the lantana scrub provides
shelter and food for the cat-bird, another cousin.
The little spotted bower-bird, though less handsome
than his relatives, is an industrious builder, the
regent being satisfied with a few' paltry twigs form-
ing a bower some 6in. long.
“Centurion” : The recent tremendous floods
in Eui'ope have given our old wartime friend, the
bombing ’plane, a chance to do its bit in time of
peace. The floods in the River Meiss in Hungary had
piled up an ice dam five miles wide, three milts
long, and 150 feet high, which was rapidly drowning
out the countr)side. A covey of ’planes bombed
the ice, with the result that the imprisoned water
broke av’ay down river, and the inundation was
averted. The idea seems capable of extension.
’Planes are getting common enough in the west of
N.S.W. and Queensland, and a force of these, equipped
with fire extinguishing bombs, might solve the
problem of dealing with the widespread grass fires
of the great western plains.

“6RS”: If “Iving-King” (B. 31/12/’25)
examines the next snake track he comes across, in
dusty or sandy ground, he will ,-see that the soil
is slightly raised on the inside of one curve and
the outside of the next. This is caused by the
pressure of its body backwards in pushing itself
along, thus showing the direction in which it is
travelling.
“Dilpo”: When a wriggler has passed over dust
or any loose substance, there are small mounds
pushed up to the front of his track, making it
as easy to follow as the trail of a horse.
“Black Tracker” : I once heard the dancing
of native-companions described as resembling a
minuet, whereas that of the eurns took the form
of kitchen lancers. Having seen both, I think the
terms quite suitable. If I had a film of an
emu dance I once saw, it would bring down the
house. I came across a family of eight birds—dad,
mum and six three-part-grown youngsters. On
reaching a grassy patch the old birds pulled up
and grunted. Immediately the younger ones, headed
by the senior, began to circle round the old birds.
Starting slowly the pace gradually increased until
full speed was attained. Then a grunt caused the
leader to stop and squat, allowing himself to be
used as a hurdle. Another grunt and it turned
on its back and its legs moved like a windmill,
all the others following suit. Another grunt
brought them all to their feet again. Then followed
more circling, this time the birds kicking widely
in all directions. I think that at this stage someone
must have sent a kick home to the old birds, for
they suddenly got into action, and, scattering the
youngsters in all directions, were soon lost to view,
* * * ■»
“Duau”: In the D’Entrecasteaux Group
(Papua), in Dobu Passage, the natives use a small
kite constructed of leaves to trail a line baited
with an exceptionally tough cobweb. The fisherman
raises the kite until the tail line —usually about
200 ft. or more long—touches the water. The fish
sees the trailing cobweb “bait,” rushes it, gets its
teeth tangled amongst, the tough silk and is promptly
gathered in by binghi.
MORE LABOR TROUBLE.
BILL: “Docs your missus still work at the
laundry?”
STEVE: “No. I had to take her away from
there; the hours were too long for me
to wait for me tea.”
“Oran”: I have been waiting for some
Maorilander to mention the best earthquake psychic
known. Long before the ’quake is perceptible to
the ordinary domestic fowl the pheasants will begin
to crow. This super-sensitiveness is well known, and
when the pheasants start crowing lustily on a still
night old timers prepare for a good shaking-up.

How sweet are the uses of publicity was
shown by the contrast of Pauline Frederick’s
triumphant arrival in Sydney with the entry
of Lord Allenby. Whereas for the film star
there were teeming thousands in front of
the Town Hall, with cordons of police and
barriers and everything, the great General
mounted the Town Hall steps through a sparse
avenue of humans, politely subdued in their
acclamations, while without the gates no
more than a hundred or so paused in the
day’s work to glimpse the show. Up at the
railway station the crowd was thicker, and
there was a splash of bunting, with, of
course, a phalanx of generals and colonels
very polished about the brass binding and
the high leather boot. The decorations (some
of them, maybe, those the momentarily angry
war lord once tried to veto) were almost
aggressively bright; and what with the spot-
less white ducks of Commodore Wardle and
his merry men, the ruby carpet and usual
what-nots, the sight was of the kind the daily
papers describe as brilliant and epochai.
Dashing it certainly was when the escort of
Light Horse jangled and swung through the
streets of their own city much as they had
jangled and swung into Jerusalem. Allenby
himself, now a tired-looking, middle-aged man
with thinning hair, looked totally different
from the leader of our imagination whose
every move we had followed breathless on
the cables. Lady Allenby, slim and grey-
marocained, and wearing a full-strength grey
plume in her black hat, went straight from
the station to the Queen’s Club with General
Ryrie’s lady and the wife of General Onslow.
There were official meals and calls all day,
and in the afternoon the Returned Soldiers
and Sailors’ League and sucli-like associa-
tions snared the great ones into the Went-
worth to a reception of the first magnitude.
Generals again, and colonels and majors by
the dozen, with their wives, and Diggers who
can claim one stripe, and those who can claim
none at all, rallied around. Two Digger
members of Parliament, Jarvic and Green,
were nearly as strong an attraction as the
great guest. Present, too, were some war-
sisters who had served witli Lord Allenby
in South Africa; and at the top table sat
Matron Kellett, who made a neat little
speech on behalf of the war nurses. Lady
Allenby (very worn-out looking) gained
moral strength from the presentation red.
white and blue bouquet, while hundreds of
female eyes raked fore and aft her necklace
of pearls.
J he Archibald prize is again the principal
chat in and about the studios. There’s a
kind of feeling growing up amongst the
youngsters that the older chaps don’t intend
to let that 400 or 500 guineas slip. This
year John Longstaff is gratified, and if lie
had not won it with his picture of Mosco-
yitcli, Lambert would no doubt have taken
it with his portrait of Archie Rankin. The
bell sleeve and the Lambert hand notwith-
standing this is a splendid picture of a
tweeded Scot, so good that one can see the
overlong straight Scotch back, which of
course, is not painted. And that raises a
question whether a portrait painter should
get full pay for half a job. What artist has
e\or been known to supply the two halves
that make the whole? The winning picture
is a great piece of work; but one still won-
ders whether The Bulletin’s old chief had
the Longstaffs, the Lamberts and the Mc-
Inneses in mind when he founded the prize.
Tirranna turned the cold shoulder on
week s kei }t wave, and Goulburn’s annual
spree came off in gold sunshine blown through
Tim Mti’lj lnCS 3S exci , tin S as iced sherbet,
lhe attendance was the youngest on re-
nresentlUfSin * i by - the i h ° rdes of imn »atures
present, a creche in the shadow of the wil-
lows seems an imminent necessity. A number
ot well-known horse-owners, like the Hor-
verf w lVingSto^S ’ Whites and M att Saw-
yers, had no entries. Every one missed the
popular Dudley Gibson, who all his life had
been on e of the features of Tirranna the
picnic had, m fact, been started by his grand
father on the Gibson estate. Another m?ss-
ing from the rally was Cripps Clark, who
was taken ill just as he was setting out for
e .., c » u I r , se on the opening day • but \ T
Faithful!, of Springfield, president of' the
Tirranna Club, wdio was absent last year
through illness, turned up in great form, and
shed the light of his old enthusiasm on the
proceedings. Three lady owners, Mrs. C. H.
Binnie, Enid Falkiner and Mrs. A. ft. Maple-
Brown, entered their fancies, and Enid, in
spite of her dress of grass-green, carried off
two firsts with Bailyer, while Tullyrush car-
ried Mrs. Maple-Brown’s colors to victory.
Mrs. W. D. Gordon, wife of the owner of
the Cup winner, received a ton of silver in
the way of prizes. Mrs. James Ashton host-
essed a crowd of youngsters in the good old-
fashioned way of seeing that they had a
good time; the presidential Faithfulls, the
Maple-Browns and Campbell Gibson were
among those who spread heady foods under
the leafy gunyah; and another supplier was
Neil McPhillamy, who made his first appear-
ance at Tirranna this year with five strange
horses, and had the good luck to carry off
four prizes.
Tirranna and Bong Bong are the two
pastoral acts slipped into the year’s social
comedy, and Phyllis and Corydon there dis-
port in an Arcadian simplicity that extends
over two days helped out by champagne
lunches, dinner parties of no mean and thirsty
variety, and a ball a night—the hat money
from both of them at Tirranna this year went
to swell the Race Club’s funds, the local
hospital, which generally bags the first night’s
harvest, being in the condition of the little
pig that stayed at home. If the atmosphere
of Tirranna ever was, as pre-war revellers
declare, big-hearted, and “country” and genial,
then some sort of chemical action has been
going on, for this year the very gunyahs
shivered with what our Bolshie friends call
class-consciousness. And the manners of
many who descended upon the post-and-rail
course are not all that a Chesterfield might
demand.
Of course, every girl who is not setting
out on the conquest of Europe and the deep-
sea officers that lie between turned up with
a powdered morning face and an outfit that
must have sent father’s bank-account back
a hundred or so. And nice-looking girls by
the dozen linked the two days with drawn-
out sweetness —you’d have know r n all about
that if at 1 o’clock in the morning you had
seen the line of waiting cars 300 long, and
nearly all a cooing-place for two. As one
girl said: “Nobody ever sits round the hall
between the dances at the Tirranna Ball; if
you can’t find a lover in a car, you’re never
too old to find a drink!”
The visiting French sloop, the Cassiopee,
churned up quite a froth of entertainment
for the Tricolor community of Sydney. On
Saturday afternoon the attractive young
Commander de Coux invited his countrymen
aboard and made the sloop and all it con-
tained theirs —for a strictly limited period.
The French Consul and his pretty bride were
a centre of interest at all the gatherings,
which included a dinner by the officers of the
Cassiopee to those of the Sydney, and a
cheerio by the Sydney to the French man-o’-
war. Dunedin, in Maoriland, is the objec-
tive of the voyage, and as the whole crew
from quarterdeck down are of an extreme
youth, the flappers of the Cold South are
in for a thrill.
This nice-looking flapper with the fine-
fresli-morning air about her is Marjorie Cox,
who, with
Daphne Ak-
hurst, is off
to Adelaide to
snatch victory
in the Austral-
asian tennis
championships.
A real country
girl, Marjorie,
now the pride
of Ingleburn,
grew up at
Narrandera,
and was al-
ready handy
with the bat
when she came
to town to
finish her edu-
cation. At
St. Gabriel’s
she starred in
the Tildesley
Shield and
other school
competitions, and in 1920 played in her
first Country Week. She has been a not-
able personality in every Country Week
since, and in 1922-3-4 covered herself with
glory in singles and doubles, both mixed
and ladies’. In addition she was picked to
play against Queensland in 1922 and against
Victoria both here and in Melbourne last
year.
The atmosphere purrs and rustles with
luxury out at the Agricultural Ground,
where the aristocrats of the road somnolently
await their new owners. Pride is theirs, and
power, and sometimes such sheer beauty of
line that the gi’ipped onlooker is paused in his
tracks. Leather npholsterings that imitate
the crocodile and the marbled covers of old-
time books are much in evidence ; and here and
there a super, not to say supercilious, model
in, a cobalt blue or shining grey dress has a
mouse-grey ribbed-velvet interior. One in
this garb ran to three easy-cliair seats: one
for the driver and two at the back, one of
them convertible into a full-length chair -
after the style of the verandah- or deck-
lounge. The seats of another let down to
form a bed. And in all the coach models, of
course, radiators and cigarette-, flask- and
card-holders. But of all the wonders seen
ac tlie show there is none in symmetry of line
to come up to the winged nymph that trims
the bonnet of the Rolls-Royce. Over one of
such, with the stealthy air of a man who
does a darksome deed, a sunbaked king of
flocks and herds was mumbling to the keeper
of the harem that lie reckoned one like that
would do.
Half of Sydney has been shocked by the
sudden death of Mrs. John Lane Mullins,
wife of the lawyer M.L.C., and sister of
Knight Tom Hughes. The lady was well
on Monday, and the blood-poisoning which
ended fatally on Friday had its origin, it is
said, in a small pimple on the face. A
husband and three daughters are left to
grieve in the Double Bay home and a large
section of R.C. Sydney is in mourning.
Back after a six-months’ dash through
England and part of Continental Europe,
artist Harry
Weston
stepped off the
Hobson's Bay
with a feeling
of delight at
getting away
from the job-
control night-
m a r e. He
went away by
th e N.D.L.
Gotha, and
the comparison
between the
foreign vessel,
on which
everything is
done to make
the voyager
feel that it is
run in his in-
terest, and the
Common-
wealth liner, which seems to exist merely to
provide good jobs, was painful to an Aus-
tralian who would like his own country’s
concerns to be best. Weston motored from
art gallery to art gallery in England, Bel-
gium and Germany, gathering a general im-
pression of decadence. In all of them mon-
strous, ugly pictures by modern artists whose
work marks them as degenerates stand cheek
by jowl with really fine masterpieces—the
latter ignored by the pimply weeds who ap-
pear to have made art—-their own sort of
art —a cult. Another nauseating impression,
to an Australian, was the number of good-
looking English girls who appear to have
entered into alliances with well-dressed
Hindus and Chinese—with their discolored
escorts they are frequent visitors to the gal-
leries. Weston, who runs the Weston School
of Drawing, is getting back to work with a
sense of relief at being again in a white
country. Of course, he had to make many
sketches and studies while he was travelling,
and the results will be seen at a show in
May or thereabouts.
Italy in Sydney greeted its new Consul,
Cavalier M. Carosi, at the Paddington Town
Hall midway through last week. The flags
of Italy and Australia and the Union Jack
fluttered on high, while Italy's
tangled up with the national red, white and
green, was the crescendo of the deception
scheme. Retiring Consul Vitali, who headed
the reception, was supported by his; #ife,
whose black satins wore a panel of royaMihie
and heavy embroideries of jet. “God S#ve”
and the Italian equivalent having inflated
with pride of race the frontal bone of all
present, Mr. Vitali made a speech of the
lightning-sketch variety, in which lie wel-
comed the new Consul and placed a verbal
cushion or two on the seat he was about to
occupy. Mr. Carosi returned the compli-
ments a hundred fold; then the social side
sparkled up and the entertainment got into
its stride.
Just as this Letter is being sent on its
way Vida Abernethy, of Rose Bay, will be
marrying “Stork” Hendry, of tlie Austra-
lia? yida is a cricket enthusiast, too,
and the ukase against the Eleven taking
their wives on tour will be a hard blow to
her. Still, rumor has it that the only two
wives who came with the English team to
Australia last year were never seen to speak
to each other, and that could hardly have
made for the joy of nations.
Keith Poulton, one of the shining examples
of the vv lute City and ail inter-State tenuis
rep was caught in the net of matrimony
midway through last week, and Merlyn
Densham, now of Manly, but once of Mel-
b“™e > the g '' rl for whom he waited
at St. Philip s. Merlyn turned up to schedule
on stepfather Osborne Norris’s arm in a
froth of satin and chiffon emblazoned with
diamente. Delzie Price and Adeline Muscio
added gold lustre in brocade and tissue to
the wedding group; Dr. Derby Loudon was
best man and Dr. BarHskill groomsman
Bride’s mother did the honors later at the
Wentworth, and the honeymoon is being-
sought in Japan. The ’groom’s grandfather.
G. A. Lloyd, was Treasurer in one Parkes
Government and other things in various
others.
A descendant of one of the 40-odd people
who “first introduced rabbits to Australia”
—although this one certainly didn’t was
married the other day. He was H. T
(otherwise “Bunny”) Holt, and the name of
the ancestral home was the Warren. The
girl in the case was Gladys Withycombe, of
Killara, and Padre E. J. Withycombe came
from West Maitland to St. James’s to audit
the vow-giving of his niece. The presence
of wrist-length closely-fitting sleeves and the
absence of train characterised the wedding
garment, which was of ivory satin. A trio
of pretty maids flashed violet georgettes and
tulle with gay addenda of pink roses and
gladioli on the gratified gaze, and Girall
Holt best-manned. Later proceedings were
taken over by bride’s mother and father at
the Cavalier.
A young man in a hurry was S. Howard
Ellis when he was suddenly recalled to Fiji,
and wanted to take Nell Joske back with
him as his bride. Nell was willing, and,
forsaking trains and veils and wreaths and
such, she slipped into a frock of ivory
georgettes with moss-green embroideries, and
a wide white hat. and therein made her vows
at St. Mark’s, Darling Point, on Monday.
Gwen and Marjorie Ryrie ’maided in white
mixed with Dutch blue, and the bride’s
mothex tapped the cellar of the Queen’s Club
for the toasts.
Orange has aixother matter to discuss
besides the Tirranna meeting—'the engage-
ment of Gladys Oates, of Warrendene
House, to Howmrd Carr, of the same town.
Katherine Osborne, newly-returned from
Europe, announces her engagement to Aub-
rey Foa (no relation to Isabel Ramsay’s
husband), who has renounced a job in the
Imperial Army to try farming in South
Afi-ica.
When Sydney sent contralto Essie Ackland
to England a while ago it did not know the
journey would end even as the proverb saith.
In London Essie and Reginald Morphew, the
Sydney tenor who had been studying in Milan
for some months, met again, and now the two
songbirds have decided on a life duet. Mean-
while Essie is booked for two concerts at
the Albert Hall this month.
Three cheers for the Far West Mission,
which has transplanted 80 kiddies from Out-
back to the seaside —from the sun-scorched
plains that lie out Bourke way (some of the
nippers travelled nearly 300 miles to reach
the train) to the Harbor beach at Manly.
The house that shelters the kiddies has been
lent by J. H. Cross, and is on the Crescent,
quite close to the swimming-pool. Forty
little boys and forty little girls got their first
glimpse of the sea last week; and did they,
like one we have read of, “stand silent upon
a peak” when the Pacific burst on their gaze?
They did not—although most of those child-
ren are frail midgets, their voices are in
pretty healthy condition. The Rev. S. G.
Drummond is in charge of the outfit, and
will be glad of donations, particularly fruit.
Address Far West Children’s Camp, Manly.
After a year or tw T o at the Staff College
in Quetta big Major Selby has returned
from India to take up Staff Corps duty in
this State.: With his little wife he has
started housekeeping in the old stone terrace
in -Wctoria Barracks, in the quarters where
Br'ig.-General Bertie Lloyd used to camp
before lie sheathed his sword and thrust the
scabbard into Vacuum oil.
,§,-I\S. from Brisbane: —
Archbishop Duhig, who can claim to have built
more churches, convents and schools than any other
man in the Southern Hemisphere, is now concentrat-
ing on a new cathedral for Brisbane. The new
building will be erected in the grounds of the
Archbishop’s palace, and tenders are being called to
level the site. The edifice is to be a replica of
St. Peter’s <at Rome; and an American cardinal,
probably Mundelein of Chicago, will be asked to lay
the foundation stone during 1927.
Brisbane City Council is busy acquiring the hills
around the city for public parks. Mount Coo-tha
(One-Tree Hill) has already been taken over, and
some hundreds of acres round about it. This will
make a j||gnifict®t ~mrk overlooking the city. The
latest Gravatt, within area
of 300 acres; White’s Hill (another favorite) tourist
resort) will, follow shortly; and the council has
an eye oil Taylor Range when the military aban-
dons it.
Queensland -is to have a new R.C. educational
order, the Oratory pf the Good Shepherd. The first
12 members from England and Ireland a
few days ago; mosjjj. of them are young men from
the universities. Rockhampton is to be the field
of their labors; a community-house has already been
established there.
Again benedictions on the aeroplane; an urgent
call was received to convey a woman seriously ill
from .Tundah to Blackall, a distance of 160 miles.
The distance was covered in 1 hour 30 minutes and
the trip saved the passenger’s life. The time will
come when every big country centre will have its
aerial ambulance—and a blessing it will be.

The opening of the tenth Federal Parlia-
ment gave G.-G. Stonehaven his first experi-
ence of the ceremony, which, incidentally,
may also be the last in the Garden City.
For these historical and statistical reasons,
and others, the public rolled up in such
cohorts that the “house full” sign was out
about two hours before the postillioned and
escorted vice-regal carriage hove in sight.
The G.-G. in his Windsor uniform, sur-
rounded by aides and brassliats of every
description, made a showing well up to
•J.C.W. panto, standard. The Chamberlain,
Captain Broadlmrst, looked a regular Goliath
in his Gordon Highlander array, and turned
many a shingled head.
Lady Stonehaven, who didn’t wait for the
tea-drinking, sat with Mrs. Bruce, wearing
a black ensemble suit with shoulder knot of
Parma violets and a black toque haloed with
tulle. The Priminister’s lady's black frock
was enlivened with ecsu lace and allied to
wide-brimmed crinoline millinery.
To many women the tea presented itself
as a glorious chance of getting a bit back
from the Government. There was at any
rate a whole-hearted onslaught, in the course
of which not only the victuals but the decora-
tive silvered baskets of crimson dahlias
were seized, leaving but an array of dirty
dishes to late comers. Senators’ wives and
a few elect feasted in seclusion. Openings
of Parliament are no longer dress parades,
and there were but few really "‘entrancing
frocks on view. Dame Mary Hughes wore
navy blue crepe de Chine with needle-point
decoration in white and a shady straw hat
of rust hue. The new Attorney-General’s
wife wore a beaded gown of sapphire-blue
with gold touches upon a black hat. Mrs.
Richard Linton (her husband is the father
of the Big Brothers) had an uncommon frock
of navy satin with bordering in a design
traced in gold thread, and wee ruby buttons.
Fawn Ottoman silk, with hat and ornamen-
tation in gobelin-blue, was Mrs. Earle Page’s
contribution. Mrs. T. Shakespeare, of the
Harbor City, who was with her husband, had
black millinery with a grey gown. Littleton
Groom, the new Speaker, didn’t look any too
pink, the pleasantries and unpleasantries
attending his election having been of a try-
ing sort. An interested spectator of the
doings was the Japanese Consul-General, Mr.
I. Tokugawa.
Fanned into flame were the still glowing
cinders of a glorious memory when officers
of the Army Administration and Egyptian
Expeditionary Forces toasted their old chief,
"Bull” Allenby, at the Windsor Hotel. The
guest’s colors were represented in baskets of
crimson dahlias and starry-blue delphiniums
on many tables; and streamers and trails of
flowers led to an overhead grouping of the
Union .Tack and Australian ensign. As fare-
wells were said the vestibule echoed to the
almost-forgotten strains of “Inky Pinky
Parley Voo” and “Down Where the Water-
melons Grow.” Billy Hughes, arriving un-
expectedly upon the scene, was given tumultu-
ous cheers when he accepted a proposal that
he should be given a commission for any
future scrap with the Turks. Generals Mon-
ash, jChauvel and Ilyrie and Brigadier-Gen-
erals Cox and Grimwade helped to fight the
battles of the Jerusalem campaign over again.
While Mayor Brunton was handing the
freedom of the city or the keys of the port-
cullis or something to soldier Allenby, his
Worship’s better half, backed by the dames
of some of the aldermen and a few others,
was doing her best to make Lady Allenby
feel at home in Melbourne. The Town Hal!
reception-room’s pink, black and dull gold
trappings were supplemented for (he occa
sion by an elaborate arrangement of pink
blossoms and palms. The dressing was
mostly in blacks and greys. The hostess,
arrayed in black, with relief in ecru lace,
bestowed a boomerang and; some lavender and
hydrangea blooms upon the visitor, whose
grey crepe-de-Chine gown was topped by
black millinery decked with shaded grey
plumes. Mrs. S. Morell, who is to take
Alderman Morell to Europe soon, wore black
and white traced georgette with a black
hat. The Cuscaden dame, Mrs. Hall Thomp-
son, Mrs. W. Cabena and Mrs. George Cres-
pin were amongst those who clinked cup and
saucer at a table on which baskets of del-
phiniums and pink and white blossoms
punctuated the sandwiches and buns.
x Members of the Royal Society of St.
George clustered round the Allenby pair
at the Oriental just before the train left for
Aloss Vale. St. George’s cross on its white
banner helped the Union .Jack to decorate
the walls; and yellow ealiiopsis brightened
the tables. President Biggs, besides giving
a combined welcome and farewell to the
Lord of Megiddo and his lady, had pleasant
words to say to Mayor Brnnton about
his new knightly handle, and a cordial
greeting for some Sydney visitors. Lady
Allcnby, who received a posy of red and
white roses, wore brown millinery surmount-
ing an ensemble gown of tan crepe romaine.
General Charnel's lady, who was a study in
golden-brown, was accompanied by her hus-
band, whose work in Palestine gave the
field-marshal the text for an eloquent piece
of praising-up.
A touch of autumn's shrewish breath made
the dressing at the V.A.T.C. races at Caul-
field mostly an affair of warm but sombre
topcoats, furs and ensemble suits. She who
deserted the straight and narrow path of
cosy, comfort for georgette and chiffon of
sleeveless mode perished, for the breeze that
whirled away discarded betting-tickets was
piercingly cold. Evidently some of the
patrons had been studying, well in advance,
the new winter styles, for there were some
rather chic models on view. One, of mole
fur, fitted snugly to the slim form of the
wearer. Louise Lovely, who wore large black
crinoline millinery; demonstrated the charm*
of white in a quilted silk coat collared and
bordered with fox. This wrap has a pedi-
gree, having been fashioned by a master-
cutter from an old French underskirt. Miss
Margaret Lewis, from Adelaide, who was
with Mrs. Barry Thomson, sported a coat of
the tapestry order traced in silver and gold
thread, with additions of grey fur, which
covered a frock of almond-green georgette.
Rear-Admiral Hall Thompson was accom-
panied by Mrs. Thompson ; she with shaded
grey plumes nodding on a mole satin hat
•above a black ensemble suit. Daughter Rose-
mary’s white frock was covered with a fancy
plaid wrap, her hat being of green Bangkok
straw. Mrs. T. Tabart, in black, had her
eldest daughter with her, in a trim grey
costume with black millinery. Mrs. Ben
Chaffey’s black tailored apparel was worn
with a bright blue velvet hat. Dr. Mac-
Eachern stopped looking at hospitals long
enough to take a peep at the horses, he and
his wife being escorted round by the Stanley
Argylc pair. Captain Iveppel-Palmer and
his bride did the lawn, she in a cherry-red
knitted silk sports suit, topped by red and
black millinery.
With the passing of the holidays “move-
ments” and organisations are once more be-
ginning to move and organise. One of the
first to show signs of returning animation
is the Red Cross Society, whose adjourned
annual meeting at Anzac House will give an
opportunity to members to say farewell to
her Excellency of the State.
Owen McKenna, the young wireless officer
who married Pleasance Rous, daughter of
Governor Stradbroke, was here last week for
a day or two, having come on the Mongolia
as a member of the staff. He has now at-
tained the rank of inspector. So far as is
known, he did not call on his in-laws. Only
one daily took any notice of him. Perhaps
the others thought that the news value of
the romance had been exhausted. Or per-
haps something else.
The first honorary general secretary of
Melbourne's branch of the Victoria League
was Miss Mary
Chomley, here
pictured by
B root horn.
Though now T
a Londoner,
she still has a
soft spot in
her heart for
the league, and
on revisiting
the Garden
City recently
she imme-
diately put her
shoulder to
the wheel to
help the organ-
isation. The
sale of sketches
and paintings
made by Miss
Chomley dur-
ing her tra-
vels has put £l3O into the Bush Library fund.
Following in Lady Forster’s footsteps,
the new Governor-General’s lady will accept
the presidency of the Uni. Symphony Orches-
tra in conjunction with that of the Lady
Northcote Permanent. Orchestra Trust.
State Treasurer Peacock’s lady and her
numerous sisters and brothers are in mourn-
ing for their mother. Mrs. J. B. Holden,
who passed out at Camberwell last week.
She outlived her husband by 19 years. Her
family of nine having grown up, Mrs. Holden
spent the last years of her life in town, and
it was at the home of her eldest, Mrs. Hors-
fall, at Camberwell that she died. The
funeral was at Warrnambool. Alee. Pea-
cock had to cancel a few engagements, in-
cluding the Parliamentary luncheon to Field-
Marshal Allenby.
Knight Arthur Rickard, of Sydney, at-
tended a farewell dinner tit the Windsor at
the invitation of directors of the hostelry
and other old friends, who drank to the tra-
veller s pleasant voyage and safe return.
Baskets of the loveliest pink and crimson
roses decorated the tables—they were simply
thrown away on mere men. The farewellers
included W. M. Hughes, who gave the chief
dissertation of the evening; James Boyd,
full of the pride that comes from having a
tennis champion in the family; lucky Percy
Hunter, receiving congratulations on his
latest new job—-he takes charge of the Pacific
Cable business over half a hemisphere—and
some others.
The broad forehead and pensive eyes here
recorded belong to Tom King, who is helping
to keep Adel-
aide on the
musical map.
In collabora-
tion with his
friend Jack
Fewster he has
written many
a t tractive
songs. Their
laLe s t and
most ambitious
effort is a
musical com-
edy, “Yvonne,”
for which
Edith Aird did
the libretto,
and which will
see the foot-
lights shortly
in the Holy
City. Lately,
when in Eng-
land, Tom wrote several musical numbers for
a revue, “Isle of Spice,” produced by Jimmy
Field. Rembrandt, of Adelaide, is respon-
sible for this picture of the composer.
Dame Wrixon, whose death in London
was announced at the week-end, was a
daughter of “Money” Miller, and widow of
a former notable figure in Victorian politics.
While representing Portland in the Assembly
Ilenry Wrixon was Attorney-General in the
G-illies-Deakin Coalition, and won fame and
a knighthood for the assertion of the prin-
ciple that the State (then a colony) was en-
titled to exclude Ah Toy, a Chinese, and,
consequently, his brethren. He had a try for
the Speakership, but was defeated. After
Federation he was President of the State
Upper Chamber for the first ten years of
the century. In. his spare time he was vice-
chancellor of the University. The stately
home the Wrixons used to occupy at Kew
is now the palace of Archbishop Mannix.
The II. A. Staughton and Ilammond
Clegg dames lunched, several friends at
Menzies’ to say nu revoir to Mrs. Sep. Levy,
of the Harbor City, who was booked to sail
Londonwards by the Grama. The guest set
off her white hair with a large brown hat
with varicolored plumage, contrasted with a
geranium-red gown. Gathered round the
damask were Airs. Simon Fraser in a light
tan suit with blending hat; Mrs. Norman
Brookes, whose black millinery topped ivory
and red apparel, and others of our very
n nicest.
Modern woman’s longing to be flat-curved
and slim was demonstrated when Gladys
Moncrieff, on her farewell appearance in this
city, was able to hand over £250 to the
Children’s Hospital as the result of sales
of her recipe for weight-reduction. The
lady charged 10s. for the remedy intended
to cause the too, too solid flesh to melt, so
her clients numbered more than half a
thousand. A life-governorship was con-
ferred on the lady.
Editor Monty Grover takes his wife and
small son on a jaunt to the land of the
bootlegger in March, and has sold his
Brighton residence as a preliminary.
There is little hope of Melbourne ever see-
ing a war memorial on the imposing scale,
projected a few years ago. Nominally the
contributions of £50.000 apiece promised by
Government and City Council are still avail-
able, but there is no chance of £150,000
additional being raised by subscription. It
looks as if Melbourne exhausted its efforts
when it obtained designs and paid the prize
money. In 1019 it might have been possible
to raise £150.000; now it is questionable if
150,000 shillings would reward an appeal.
Full houses are enjoying Tal Ordell’s new
Australian play “Kangaroo Flat,” which
gives Maggie Jarvis, as the. heroine, the right
to wear some very pretty frocks. Particu-
larly fetching is a pink one embellished with
wee ruches of shaded ribbon. Hilda Dorring-
ton, as a bold, bad adventuress, clothes her
wickedness in magpie raiment, black lace
over white satin, with drooping millinery,
being followed by a short gown of scintillat-
ing sequins and white georgette worn with
a red rose.
T -l-wice a year members of the Children's
Nurses’ League, over a hundred strong, meet
to diseuss old times, and their latest' re-
union took place in the lovely setting of the
Fitzroy Cardens. Among those who enjoyed
the picnic were the president t .Matron
Walsh ot the Children’s Hospital) and'the
bon. secretary, Miss A. Smith.
The success of St. Vincent’s Hospital
Appeal's "Opportunity Shop” helps to ex-
plain how old clothes dealers can take trips
to Europe. . Cast-off duds find a ready mar-
ket, and in the sure and certain hope of a
further harvest the Cyclorama emporium
has opened its doors once again, prepared to
take what folks don’t want, and sell it to
those who do want it. A telephone mes-
sage to Cyclorama Buildings or the Appeal
office, Capitol House, ensures that goods will
be called for.
The kite-flying season being now in full
swing, the Electricity Commission is be-
ing moved to official bad language because
of interruptions in its service caused by
these delights of the small boy becoming
entangled in the overhead cables. The youth
of Geelong seem particularly addicted to
kite-flying, for in one week the local repair-
gang had to turn out four times to remedy
short-circuits caused by entangled kites.
How it is that some of the flyers have not
been electrocuted is a mystery, for in most
cases the cables affected have been carry-
ing high power. Yet no report is to hand
of any damage to the urchin holding the
string. All the same, the Commission is
issuing a warning, the teachers are to lec-
ture on the subject after the school vacation,
and Marmaduke’s mother might profitably
say a few words before teacher has the
chance.
“Aladdin’s” principal girl, June Elvidge.
passed the tea-cups to theatrical associates
and some off-stage friends at the Oriental on
a recent afternoon, doing the honors in a
skirt of black-and-white d raughtboard-check
attached to a long bodice of white cloth,
topped by a swathed black toque.
Freda Bage, of the Women’s College in
Brisbane, drove her own car to Melbourne
to join her mother and sister for_the vaca-
tion. Dentist Martha Burns, ot Brisbane,
and another friend accompanied her on the
overland trip, which was accomplished with-
out mishap in nine days.
Thelma Asche, B.A., of the auburn locks
- —and now you know what irreverent pals
call her—is bound for a year’s holiday at
least in the Big Smoke, where she will stay
awhile with Uncle Oscar and aunt Lily.
Accompanying her is pianist Gladys Smith,
whose recitals have been full of promise.
Mrs. T. G. White, booked for a year’s
sojourn in foreign parts, was bidden to drink
tea in the lounge of the Oriental on Friday
afternoon. Mrs. Barry Thomson, the host-
tes8j< was in knife pleatings of georgette and
same hued crinoline millinery, the guest
featuring the latest of trimming in silver
kid upon her pervenche blue gown. A bril-
liant ornament twinkled on the upturned
bCr* of her velvet hat. Jennie Benson, prin-
cipal boy in “Aladdin,” was there, demure
iff grey-tailored suit with a navy hat, and
another was Mae Baird, in green velvet em-
bellished with brown fur and ecru lace.
Mrs. Hugo Throssell (Katharine Prich-
ard), the Australian novelist, is renewing her
acquaintance with. Melbourne, where she had
her first journalistic experience. She has
no leaning towards the social round, finding
her pleasure in her home and in writing
stories for other folk to enjoy. From the
bush lands and hills around her home, about
f>0 miles from Perth, she has gained inspira-
tion for her latest novel, “Working Bui
locks,” now on its way to the publishers.
While in Melbourne last week Judge
Beeby, of N. S. Wales, gave a lift to “Polly
with a Past,” now running at the King’s.
'S'Onor was robbed of a wallet containing
£15, some private papers and three tickets
for “Polly.” He; thinks that the pinching
wag done while he was getting on a tram in
Boftrke-str|et, or just when he boarded the
tram and was crushing through a crowd on
the back platform.
Avoiding the winter fogs and snows of the
Great Smoke. Mrs. R. G. Casey has taken
up quarters in? Cairo for some months. She
writes of wonderful and unique entertain-
ments. Her own most recent contribution
to the social round was a camel ride in the
desert by moonlight, with a jazz band and
native dancers stepping round fires of cotton
bush to cheer the Sahara up a bit.
A ceremony in which bells, confetti and a
bit out of “Lohengrin” will find a place is
meditated by Una Uren, of Gardlenvale, and
Howard MacMahon, elder son of the W. H.
MacMahons, of Warrnambool. The an-
nouncement has been the occasion for a
shower of congratulations.
The spires of St. Paul’s are on the road
from architect’s dream to builder’s actuality.
Six months of asking has brought in ±35,000,
half the sum required to erect tbiese Heaven-
pointing fingers, and the laying of foundation-
stones may be expected soon.

APPOINTMENT TO
THE PRINCE OF WALE&
28th Nov., 1925.
Messrs. Crossley Motors (Aust,), Ltd.,
87 William Street,
Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —
I have been driving my “Crossley” Car, 15/du hi.,
for 12 months, and have covered 10,000 miles on all
classes of roads.
During that time I have travelled through South
Australia. New South Wales and Victoria on private
and official business, and up till now 1 have not had
occasion to take a tool out of the* case nor been held
up through engine or tyre, trouble.
It will interest you to know that on the South
Australian trip I covered 1500 miles, carefully cheek-
ing and measuring the petrol, and I averaged for the
total distance 29 miles to the gallon ; on one section,
from Melbourne to Hamilton, 200 miles, I averaged
32 miles per gallon.
I have only just arrived from Melbourne, and I feel
sure you will be pleased to know we had no trouble of
any sort, and the engine is still running beautifully.

Dear Sirs, —
It gives me pleasure to subscribe to the general
efficiency and all-round dependability of the 15/80
H.P. “Crossley.”
As you know, it is 15 months since this firm first
purchased a “Crossley” Car, and it was not until this
car had been on, the road continuously for 12 months
that we had it overhauled.
There were no mechanical defects, and it was the
condition of this car that decided us to standardise
on Crossleys throughout.
The new model appears to be even superior to last
year’s, and if we get the same service from the new
cars that we obtained from the old one we shall be
very satisfied.
Yours faithfully,
ARTHUR RICKARD & CO., LTD.,

wood and the South Coast, 34 miles per gal on. I hfs
is ordinary driving, without any special attention. 1

Electrical development received its biggest impulse
when Westinghouse conceived the idea of harnessing
the tremendous reserves of power in Niagara Falls.
This was the starting point of modern electrical endeavor, and the
experience gained by over fifty vears of electrical achievement has been put
into the development of the WESTINGHOUSE FARM ELECTRIC PLANT.

This is an age of progress. Men and women are no longer content to
just manage with makeshifts. Everyone wants the convenience of
Electric Light, and rightly so. In the country areas, electric light alone
means a wonderfully improved standard of living. But when you
consider the multiplicity of odd jobs that can be done in the home and
on the farm with the aid of electric power, a'| Westinghouse becomes
more than desirable—it becomes a necessity. It will provide power for
pumping, milking, separating, grinding, sweeping, washing, ironing,
and the sewing-machine, as well as many other tasks. It will provide power to (Operate a water-
pressure system and the means of fighting fire. It will run electric fasns and the Kelvinator. In
short, it will make life easier, better and brighter, and it s is so economical too,
<
Ihe wonderful Westinghouse guarantees, too, are worth looking into, they protect you so fully.
You tell us what sort of work a plant could do for you, and we will tell you the, type, size and
price of the plant you need, as well as how you cun pay foi* it while yo>u use it. Write for the
Westinghouse booklet, it is really interesting and will not obligate you in any way.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The first race at Rosehill (N.S.W.) on
Saturday was won easily by High Plume (twenties)*
whom nobody fancied but owner-trainer Teddy Keys,
and the next was just as easy for the outsider Don
Moon (twenties). In the third race there was a
rush for Tibbie (5 to 4), but the distance-seven
furlongs—was too short for the Mountain King
Ladv Mehi filly, and St. Eaton (sevens) gave Munro
one' of the few successful rides he has had since
Windbag started on his holidays. When Braehead
(evens) was downed by the 33-to-l chance Pile
Queen in the Flying Handicap punters mused
gloomilv on the old “head’s” maxim: Always play
light when you’re losing, but when you re betting
with their money give it a fly.” W ithin a few
minutes, however, Pile Queen had been placed second
for crossing Braehead before she was the regulation
two lengths ahead ; also, the multitude collette on
Suggrapho (6 to 4) in a youngsters race and
Meenah (5 to 2) in the January Handicap, both
Booth-trained and Toohey-ridden; and there was
almost as much public money for ISoble pyce v<
2) in the Carlingford Mile as there was for unlucky
Sea Risk (5 to 2). who ran second, and who is too
small for the burdens he is getting m welters with
an Bst. minimum. So the day wasn’t so disastrous
as it threatened to be early in the P iece > eve **
though the 6-to-4 chance Shanakiel, who belongs
to the unlucky owner of Lile Queen, was beaten
by Tribute (twenty-fives) in the first division or
Suggrapho’s handicap. Lile Queen looked to hate
Braehead’s measure when she moved toward the rail
and got in his track, but under Rule 1-3 tne
stewards had no option but to take the race away
from her. It was tough luck for the Lile Queen
crowd, but the rules must be obeyed.
Braehead’s gallop did not suggest that he will
win the A.J.C. Challenge Stakes at Randwick next
Saturday with Bst. 101 b., although he had 41b. more.
He is a seven-year-old stallion, and romance may
now be more in his line than racing. Irish Prince
(Sst. 31b.) looks a fair thing for the Challenge
Stakes if he doesn’t go wrong before the event as
he did before the Epsom. Red Gauntlet (9st. mb-)
mav be the next best at the weight. in spite
of his Tatt.’s Cup failure, Dainty Davie (Bst. 31b.)
promises to see a short price for the Anniversary
Handicap, to be run on the Tuesday, and Meenah
(Bst.V though she also failed in Tatt. s Cup and
did nothing wonderful at Rosehill, will likewise
have troops of friends. This page would rather
take tote odds about one of the pluggers, Ludden-
ham (7st. 71b.), Highlander (7st. 31b.) and Gada-
min (6st. 121 b.). Gadamin (Gadabout —Minju),
whose recent form has been pretty good, And w’ho
has shown that he can stay a mile and a halt, may
furnish a surprise. And Tibbie will, perhaps, prove
a better tote spec, in the Adrian Knox Stakes than
Valicare, who will probably start at odds-on. Ihe
Newcastle fillv may not beat the brilliant daughter
of Valais, but she is likely to win a race during
the meeting. „
* * * *
With two first favorites successful, and
every other w T inner well backed, punters had a
pleassmt time at the V.A.T.C. January meeting at
Caulfield. Despite his Bagot Handicap and Hope-
toun Cup failures, Suomi was made a 3-to-l favorite
for the Anniversary Handicap, with Master Vibrator
(7 td 2) next in order, Spearage at 9 to 2, The
Tyrant at sixes, Llanthony at tens and the others
at forlorn-hope odds. Llanthony, as usual, was out
in front early, but The Tyrant cut him down at the
turn, and at the distance looked a certain winner.
However. Suomi came with a great run and, splen-
didlv ridden by Dempsey, got the verdict by a
head from Stuart Brunton’s old gelding, with the
much-improved Woolpack a good third and Master
Vibrator, who found his 9st. ?lb. a bit too mu
to carry fourth. Suomi, who is by Finland war
talk, is trained by L. J- Mf a nn f°r Mrs Russell
Gabb • he is a bit unreliable, but on lus day is
very good. He covered the 11 furlongs in 2min.
21|sec. Mercian King’s brother, King ,ps“c-
had run a good second to Greensborough at hlem
ington on New Year’s Day, and was supposed to
have improved in the meantime, was a 6-to-L
favorite for the Holiday Stakes for two-year-olds,
but Greensborough (4’s) was again too good for
him, winning brilliantly by a long neck from the
unlucky Rainproof; the favorite was thud. Th
winner carried top-weight, 9st„ and ran the 5i
furlongs in Imin. 73sec. ;he has now had three con
secutive wins, and has proved a bargain for his
owner. S. F. Reynolds, as he was an inexpensive
yearling. Followers of Holt’s stable had something
to plunge on in the Tooronga Handicap, for bailing
Home was a class above 'the other starters. Backed
down to G to 4 against, the imported horse, with
Duncan on top, won at his ease from hibano and
Chickling. He had 9st. 51b. on Ins back and covered
the 7 furlongs in Imin. 27sec., which is capital
time for Caulfield. The English stallion captured a
fair handicap at Randwick last Easter, and, all
going well, will be there again.
“Hasen”: The Queensland bookmaker who
told me this was certainly disgruntled and may
have been biased, but I have reason to belieie that
he is truthful. The meeting gave every sign of
being a frost. Scratchings had reduced the fields to
a minimum, the attendance was limited and the
club’s takings totalled a little more than £2O.
Heroic measures seemed called for, and they weie
forthcoming. The peculiar position arose of a
race-club turning punter on its own course, it put
the whole of the takings on a horse in the first
race, and the judge had no difficulty in placing it
first. My bookmaker said it wasn t beaten by
more than a length, anyway.
“Rulimba”: Racing form is easy to fol-
low in Brisbane, once you get the hang of it.
All vou have to do is to pick out a horse that
runs'last in one race and follow the money. A
steed returning to registered racing aftei a spell
with the ponies started in a hirst Division at
Albion Park. He ran unbacked, was never in the
hunt and finished second-last. The sporting scubes
noted this as a promising performance. At his next
start the animal was dropped a division; again
unbacked, he ran last throughout. The papets
promptly labelled him as soon due. His connec-
tions scratched him after that, fearing that they
would not get a price. Punters are anxiously wait-
ing for his next start.
HOLLOW-TREE FLAT GOES IN FOR A PETROL-PUMP.
“Ascot” : Year after year Seremond heads
the sires’ list in Queensland. He is the most,
successful because the most, prolific of the leading
stallions ; if he misses the big plums (the Cups and
Derbies) he makes up for it with the number o
smaller prizes. Seremond’s progeny run in all
shapes and sizes, and over all distances. Jabragalba
was second in the Queensland .Cup (two miles^, and
at the same meeting won weight-for-age races ove
nine and eleven furlongs; Taupo (a three-year-old)
is the champion miler ; and Gold Frock and Direct
Action have won two-year-old races ove^ ve / url
In addition to these cracks, Seremond is repre
sented by a prodigious number of useful handn
cappers. If a meeting goes by without one> of them
winning, the papers make a note of it, the occur
rence is so rare.
*** * ■
“Hasen”: Porterbali, an aged Beeabah
gelding, has been astonishing the inhabitants of
the unregistered courses in Brisbane. Despite the
handicapper’s best efforts he keeps on winmaig.
His latest success was gained in the b>B 1a c ®
Kedron with 12st. lllb., the next in weight carry
ino- lost., and the rest 9st. 3lb. or less. The follow
in° day’s paper included this in its account;
S “Porterbah was accorded a hearty reception.
Addressing the crowd, Mr. E. J. Lawrence (manager
and handicapper) said it had been rumored tla.
Porterbah had not been carrying his correct weight
in his races, and he extended a hearty invitation to
any of the public to come and see the rider weigh
Which strikes me as a quaintly humorous thing
for the manager of any racecourse to say.
Another of the coons that came from
’Frisco in the last crate consigned to Stadiums Ltd
made his Australian debut on Saturday night at
Rushcutter Bay and created a very poor impression.
His name was given as Joe Hall, and his hide is
as near coal-black as don’t matter. His head is
small and well-shaped, and his nose is so almost a
negligible quantity that the suggestion of one nng-
sider that Paul Demsky, his white opponent, should
“hit him on the bridge of the nose” was received
as the acme of sarcastic humor. Joe proved him-
self a star dancer, for he kept up the Shenandoah
Shuffle throughout the 20 rounds. In his corner was
Demskv’s former trainer, and every time Paul faced
that way said trainer and the black’s manager made
gestures' obviously intended to put the lad oil
his stroke. The verdict was rightly given to the
white man who, at least, tried to make a fight of
it, but the crowd voted it a rotten show. Demsky
9.11$, Hall 9.9J.
* * *
Melbourne Stadium patrons were served
with another mixed grill on Saturday night. In
the first of the two 20 -rounders Jack oameron
(TO 41 proved too tough a joint for Jack Joseph
(also 104) • after a rally in the 17th round, which
went very much in Cameron’s favor, Joseph emerged
with a badly-cut lip that signalled to the referee
that he had had his issue. Cameron showed his
best form to date. In the second bout the efforts
of the abo. Billy Samuels (10.12) to annihilate
Dave Palmer (10.21) caused the latter some worry,
but after being down for nine in the fourth round
Palmer came back full of fight. He dropped Samuels
for a short count in the fifth, and again for nine
in the sixth. Each had a trip to the canvas in
the eighth, but what promised to develop into an
epic contest was terminated in the twelfth when
Samuels ripped in a left that landed very low and
doubled Palmer up. Quirk had no option but to
crown Palmer.
* * * *
“K.E.”: Veteran Ted Horsburgh made an
appropriate final appearance on the Yarra last Sat-
urdav when he helped to win the final of Mel-
bourne’s combination eights after two very
strenuous heats. Ted pulled a lusty oar in the
famous Yarra eight stroked by the late Ted Ainley
which, 35 years ago, put up the record of winning
eight successive senior events, a performance only
once since equalled in Victoria. A few years ago
he won a combination eight with his son a mem-
ber of the crew. At 60-odd he says he will really
have to give up the game, otherwise he may be turned
down for athlete’s heart in the next war.
Of recent years Australia lias been short
of first-class swimmers in the sprinting division, but
in snowy-haired Frank Doyle it has a youth already
capable of making a
race of it with Weis-
muller and B o rg,
Doyle, a well-built six-
footer with a deter-
mined jaw, is not yet
18. At the Sydney
Domain Baths on
Saturday he won the
100 yards State title
for the second time,
losing Keith Kirkland
and Frank Carberrv
in a sprint from the
75 yards, in 54 1-5
sec.—the best figures
ever registered by an
Australian.’ His 1925
time was 57 1-5 sec.,
but he has improved
wonderfully in a year,
and he is going to
improve still more.
Weismuller’s 52 2-5
sec. is the world’s
record; the fastest
Australian time, 53 4-5
sec., w a s made by
Kahanamoku in 1915.
Another comer is R.
Cameron, a Manly boy,
who won the 220 yards
junior title in 2min.
41 2-5 sec., a record
for the race. Cameron
is only 15. Moss
Christie (holder) was
never troubled _ in the
half-mile, which he
covered in llmin. 47
2-5 sec. ; and Frank
Bayldon, the third
swimmer to retain a
title, collected the 220
yards breast-stroke in
3min. 14sec. Doyle,
Christie and Bayldon
will represent N.S.W.
in the Australian championships. #
“Centurion” : The U.S.A. has bestowed the
final accolade of approval on golf, which now ranks
second only to racing as a vehicle for gambling in
Gahd’s own country. At the Chicago amateur cham-
pionships bets of 50,000 dablers to 10,000 were flymg
about like scandals at an Australian Labor conference ,
on the first dav alone over 500,000 dalilers was
booked as changing hands. The opportunities for
running a bve are unparalleled m any othei spoit,
but this fact does not deter Silas Buncostem, and
the Golf Association’s efforts to squelch wagering
on tournaments have been unavailing.
* * * *
N. S. Wales made sure of the Sheffield
Shield bv overwhelming the South Australians °n the
Svdney CG. The affair lasted six days (oh, these
six-day matches!), and 1929 runs were scored a
record for first-class cricket: N.S.W., 642 and 093,
S A 475 and 219. For the winners Collins made
108 ’and 84, lvellewav 111 and 75, Bardsley 109 and
13 Andrews 98 and 72, Kippax 21 and 11, and
Tavlor 82 : for the losers Arthur Richardson 153,
Vic Richardson 107 and 27, Rymill 23, and 52 n. 0.,
and Alexander 59. The last-named batted under
difficulties in the first innings, and was unable to bat
at all in the second—a mild attack of influenza was
the trouble. His style greatly impressed the old
hands in the members’ pavilion, but it is more like
Rock’s than Trumper’s. Apart from Andrews,, who
got 3 for 34, The slow bowlere were unmei cifullj
pasted : Mailey’s figures were 0 for 103! and '
nc; Grimmett’s 4 for 192* and 6 for 202. iveue
wa ’y (2 for 83 and 1 for 41) and Arthur Richardson
(2" for 112 and 2 for 35) were distinctly moie diffi-
cult to play. It is increasingly clear that both these
men will have to be included in the team tor ling-
land, together with one of the following batsmen,
should it be decided to take 16 players: Vic.
Richardson, Woodfull, Kippax, Rymill and Alexander.
In spite of Bardsley’s century, he was very lucky
to be picked before one of these young fellows,
who all excel him in the field, and so was Mailey
lucky to be selected before Kelleway or Arthur Rich-
ardson. # *
“Tren” : One of the reasons of Victoria’s
pre-eminence in cricket in past seasons it won three
Shields out of four and 14 Shield matches out ol
16—was the Ma State’s inability to put a thoroughly
representative XI into the field. After making
his 53 against the N. S. Welshmen, Billy Woodfull
remarked that he had never before faced Gregory.
It was the first time in four seasons that Kanga
had been available against Victoria. #
“Shrewsbury”: Though the movement to
send Bob Crockett, the famous cricket umpire, to
England with the Australian XI has its merits, there
are visible drawbacks —that is, if “Crock is to. do
any umpiring on the tour. In England the umpnes
in county and Test matches are retired professionals,
and the fees form a considerable portion of their
income. To be appointed a regular county umpire
is the ambition of most old “pros,” and he who
is endorsed as a first-class umpire by the M.C.C. and
is available for Tests, Gentlemen v. Players, and other
big games, holds his head high among his fellows
apart from the pecuniary side of the job. Should
“Crock” supersede any of these men in the big
games there would be some feeling, not only
because of the cash involved, but of the slight,
actual or implied, to professional dignity. #
“Hasen”: In a column-long discussion of
the Queensland representative cricket team a Bris-
bane Daily Mail scribe mentions no end of good
points in its members. His headlines, however, m
heavy type, seem rather captious and discouraging,
such' as “Fast Bowler Necessary” and “Fielding
Bad” and the like. But the last (with the aid of
the comp.) is the worst. It is “Strong in Bathing.
As cricketers they are dashed good surfers, I sup-
P ose - # *
“Adelaide”: Cricket played with one eye
on the clock, English fashion, can have its exciting
moments. In the last round of club-cricket in
Adelaide East Torrens met its neighbor and rival,
Kensington. (The Kensington district was carved
out of the large and powerful E.T. only two years
ago.) On a bad wicket, both went out in an
afternoon, Kensington having the lead by one run.
It was short of Rymill, away on inter-State business,
but E.T. similarly was lacking Murray. For the
latter, on the second and final afternoon, Loveridge
declared with seven for about 170, in a sporting
attempt to win outright. Sportingly, also, Bowley and
Stirling started to knock up that total in two hours,
but presently Kensington was playing hard meiely
to save the game —which meant winning on the first
innings. The last man was in, 40 runs behind, and
the last over was being played, when in the excite-
ment the batsmen dashed off for a short run—
which was not the least good to them and lost
the last wicket. Thus, instead of Kensington getting
three points for a first-innings win, E.T. got 4 for
winning a completed match. It is their first win
this season.
* * * *
“R.M.”: The Speck, which is represented
in Wisdf.n by C. J. Eady's still unbeaten score of 566
for Break o’ Day v. "'Wellington, is pressing for
official recognition of another world’s record. Play-
ing on the New Town ground against North-West
Hobart, 0. A. Burrows, who bowls fast-medium for
the home team, scattered the stumps with the last
ball of an over and sent a bail spinning nearly to
the boundary. The position was pegged and the
distance from the wicket taped at 83yds. 1ft. 9m.
The previous world’s record, made in a minor count}'
match, Bedfordshire v. Suffolk, at Luton, in 1908,
was 70lyds. #
“H. Hardupp”: Unless Loughlin, the N. S.
Wales Lands Minister, lodges a caveat, the Rugby
League is to secure a renewal of its lease of the
dingy Sydney Sports Ground. The Soccer crowd
offered a higher percentage of the takings than that
offered by the League, with a guarantee mentioned
as “much more than £500.” The League’s guarantee,
however, was £900, and, in view of the larger atten-
dances its games draw, it was given the preference.
There is a proviso that if the ground is wanted
for an inter-State or international match by any other
sporting body the League will vacate it for that da.v
—if it hasn’t arranged an inter-State or international
match of its own. Unless the League has changed
its spots or taken too many of them, it will work
that particular loophole for all it is v'orth.
* * * *
S.A. Football League has come to the con-
clusion that its secretaryship is a full-time job for
one man. The position has been offered to Frank
Marlow, the present secretary, if he cares to give
up other work. The League has also decided to let
its finance be in the hands of three picked men
instead of having one from each of the eight clubs
as finance committee. This was readily agreed to, but
a motion to treat the team-selection committee on
exactly similar lines was carried only by a bare
majority.
In the S.A. tennis championships, fought
out without, any outside competition as in March,
titles were not disturbed. G. M. Hone again won
the singles from Rowe, 3 sets to 1; in the doubles,
Rowe and Gurner won by the same margin from Hone
and the veteran left-hander Geoff Thomas. Miss Le
Messurier retained the women’s championship easily,
and with Mrs. Rowe (the astonishing mother of the
male player of that name) the doubles after a good
fight ' . • .
“Machete”: The Victorian Ladies’ Bowl-
ing Association keeps a sharp eye on the moral
aspect of a game to which the flighty Anne Boleyn
was addicted before she “did her block” over Henry
yill and others. On the eve of a recent tournament
the committee announced that competitors in short
skirts would not be allowed on the mat. The reason
given for the ukase was that a player had recently
appeared in “a most indecent costume, and that
a lot of others had been “over the odds.” Now'
every baldhead in Melbourne who has been wasting
o-ood monev on front seats at the pantomimes is
kicking himself to think of the free shows he
has missed.

Can pour the vials of his wrath upon the referee.
The jockey who is carpeted for some untoward biz
Calls heaven and earth to witness that the fault was
none of his;
’Twas something no one could foresee nor anyone
prevent
Invariably keeps his prad from winning the event.
The stricken punter curses form; the fellow who
mis-cues
Will mostly put the blame upon the chalk he didn t
use.
The gambler who when heading ’em abruptly nas
to stop
Will heap his execrations on the uninvited cop.
The angler, fishless, damns the bait; the bowler
when chagrined
Emits, it seems, profane remarks about the gusty
wind.
He’s such a portly, placid soul that when it queers
his pitch,
I wonder if his store of words is adequately rich.
N.S.W,
FORD.

PLUM RAZOR
fgdf
gd
Out many years' practical experience has brought us razor
knowledge that enables us to offer a perfect shaving blade in
THE PLUM." So sweetly smooth and keen is its edge, no
beard, however tough and wiry, can withstand it,
FOR THIRTY-FIVE YEARS "THE PLUM” HAS RETAINED THE CONFIDENCE
AND PATRONAGE Of MEN WHO APPRECIATE ITS STERLING QUALITIES,
CRAIG & AIT KEN, 654 b., GEORGE ST., SYDNEY.
THE INKY WAY.
Derby Clonard”: A Melbourne printing establish-
ment employs, as apprentice, a full-blooded Australian
abo., one Jack Johnson. Despite his name, he is of
entirely gentle disposition.
“Hamer”: Meet my literary optimist.. He had
great hopes about his book. Some time after its
publication 1 met him and naturally asked how
things were going. “Oh, there’s a steady sale,” he
replied cheerfully—“about one a month.”
“S.T.S.”: In a par. (B. 19/11/’25) dealing with an
Adelaide cross-word competition, there is a reference
which fairly plainly implicates Dr. O. H. Souter as
being an unsuccessful competitor who entered a
protest. I have Dr. Souter's assurance that it is
a case of mistaken identity.
“Alastor”: A Welsh poet, the Rev. B. Ceitho-
Davies, is in Australia on a health trip, and has
taken temporary charge of the Blackstone Welsh
Chapel at Ipswich (Q.). Before the church called
him, he worked with Sir William Davies, of the
Western Mail, Wales, a prominent member of the
recent Imperial Press picnic; also he was literary
secretary to the National Eisteddfod of Wales. The
Blackstone Church already supplies Queens-
land's Welsh festivals with an array of the best
Eisteddfod talent; and the new man will add more
fuel to the national flame.
“Old Nick’s Son”: There is at. least one paper in
Australia that is permitted to defy the copyright
• laws and lift as much as it pleases from its con-
temporaries without acknowledgment or protest. This
is the News Letter, published twice a month at
Fremantle prison. It was started a couple of vears
ago by the then Colonial Secretary, R. S. Sampson,
himself a printer, with the object of teaching the
inmates to set up and turn out a newspaper. It
is edited by the gaol chaplain, and most of its con-
tents is lifted from dailies and weeklies, The
Bulletin being heavily levied on.
“Fitzcray”: Reference to the demise of Melbourne
Punch (B. 24/12/'’2s) recalls a happening that
brightened the latter days of Melbourne Sum. One
of the heads found fault with the manner in which
his junior reporters set out their “stories,” and
wrote two examples, a right way and a wrong way,
for their guidance. The specimen “story” dealt with
the mythical murder of an imaginary Melbourne
society beauty by her jilted fiancee, an entirely
supposititious A.D.C. at a non-existent Government
House. The expert handled this material in such
masterly fashion that someone took the stuff for
gospel truth —it had been set up in the lino, room—
and the news filtered through to one of the morning
paper offices the same evening. The blood experts
of the journal were hurried out on the trails, and
a special write-up man was recalled from his suburban
home, and set down at a telephone to handle the
big splash. It was late before the disgusted truth
sneaked back to the office, and a maddened new#
staff realised that it had pulled its own leg.
“Waitemata”: Henry Brett, Auckland’s new knight,
while he has not had much to do with the literary
side of the business for many decades, has better
claim than many other newspaper proprietors who
assume it to the title of journalist. Arriving in
Auckland at 19—he is now 82—he got a job as
reporter on the old Southern Cross, now defunct for
half a century. Four years later he went over to
the Herald, and after four years there entered part-
nership with Mc-Cuilough Reed and started the Star
on which he got his first experience of the cares (and
profits) of ownership. The Star has never looked
back, and to-day, contests with the Herald the
right to claim the biggest Maoriland circulation.
King Dick wanted to put him in the Uppah Chambah
in 1899, but Henry wasn’t taking any. In 1904
he was. discreetly informed that if he wanted a
handle to his name he need onlv say so, but again
he ducked. Six years ago, when he attended the
Imperial Press Conference in Britain, the offer was
renewed, but Brett had not changed’ his mind. In
recent years he has taken to the pen again and
has written “White Wings,” a book about clipper
ships of a by-gone generation.
“Old Hand” : Quite early in just-dead W. H. Warren’s
professorial career, when he had given only eight years
to the Sydney Engineering School, he was appointed
to the Baldwin Engines Commission., It was there
I first came to respect him. A colleague, now a
long-established dentist in Maequarie-street, and mv.
self had by the grace of Critehett Walker been
appointed shorthand writers to the Commission. That
class of work was farmed out in the good old days,
and we thought our task would be to record the
usual gamble, easy to take and signifying nothing.
But when we came Up against Warren our fingers
were paralysed. The Commission had arisen out
of the charges made by W. F. Schey, a- Labor light
of those days, who said the engines, a type that ranted
as giants in U.S.A., were no good for their job of
hauling loads over the Blue Mountains. He charged
Railway Commissioner Eddy with the responsibilitv,
Warren, bright-eyed and alert, took over the whole
technical side of the inquiry. It was just there we
sweated, strained and breathed curses, for Warren
hurled about all sorts of strange anji unaccustomed
technical terms and simply bubbled over in a
stream of formulae. At tng close of a sitting our
heads buzzed and the awful' task of trying to dis-
entangle the weird note of the evidence appalled us.
In the end we had to have frequent recourse to the
Professor. He was wonderfully patient, unravelling
mysteries to us with the resignation of an elderly
lady with a tangled skein of silk. It was at
this Commission I realised what torture a mean
soul can inflict on a high-minded fellow-mortal.
Railway Commissioner Eddy was under cross-examina-
tion, and a question was put to him that touched
the core of his honor. He was a highly strung man,
verf emotional. With an indignant deiffal of the
innuendo, he dropped into his seat, put his fade is
his hands, and sobbed like a child.
AN ANCIENT TALE AND A MODERN MUSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Police inquiries into the push outrage on Friday
strengthen the theory that the attack on the Boundary
Hotel was a reprisal for a Supposed insult to a girl
friend of a member of the Wanderers push by one
of the local gangs. ‘There is usually a girl at the
back of every push fight,’ said a constable.’’— Melbourne
item.
Oh, lend me now some old heroic lyre
To hymn this Helen of a later day,
And let me burn anew with ancient fire
To put a glow into my modern lay!
A Preston Agamemnon I discern,
A Paris come from Coburg for his fling:
Of love and war there’s something still to learn,
When Winnie of the Wanderers I sing.
“Arms and the Man”.... (Aw, what’* the crimson
me?)
Be still, 0 Muse; some dignity I beg 1
“Arms and the Man” I sing.... ( Turn of] the
juice,
An’ quit yer flamin’ 'pullin’ of me leg!

Who’s Paris, ehf An’ this here Aggie coot?
Say what yer mean or shut yer bloomin' gob—
Arms an’ the Man be blowedt Blokes an’ the
boot I)
Mark how’ the avenging legions, unafraid,
t'pon the ranks of ravishers deploy,
And find their inspiration in a maid
hike one who lit the topmost towers of Troy.
The glint of steel is duller than the gleam
Of their fierce eyes. Now hear the welkin ring
As swiftly on the shouting cohorts stream—
’Tis Winnie of the Wanderers they sing.
Oh, star-eyed Helen of a ( Can it, son!
She doesn’t need no alias, does Win;
O) monikers she uses only one,
So stow the gab, or trouble ’ll begin,
An’ what’s ail this about the glint o’ steel?
We don’t take knives when scrappin’ for a tart;
A bottle on the bean still makes ’em squeal—
D’yer think we’re flamin’ Dagoes? Have a heart!)

“Monsieur Beaueaire” strutted once more
at the Sydney Royal on Saturday night; but
most of his contemporaries had forgotten to
learn the strut that marked the age of lace,
powder and perfumes, but very few baths.
The ultra-heroic romance can be made be-
lievable by the well-arranged sequence of
stirring incident and the atmosphere lent
by costuming and manners. That has been
shown by Julius Knight, who gave “Beau-
caire” several profitable revivals, and Lewis
Waller, who had Madge Titheradge as his
Lady Mary. Both filled out their perform-
ances with a perfection of detail not so evi-
dent in Saturday’s production; and a sigh
might be breathed also for Knight’s vanished
calves. Such a play needs to stand upon
legs that at least look good.
* * * *
The “Beaueaire” resurrection, after suffi-
cient years to make the story new to a fresh
generation, was made a double event by the
first appearance of Mary Hinton (Hon. Mrs.
Pitt Rivers) on the professional stage. But
the gulf between fairly successful amateurism
and star professionalism is wide; and Mary
Hinton remains an amateur. The stately
aloofness of the Lady Mary Carlisle of the
early acts was beyond her powers; she was
more like a shy bird than the self-possessed,
proud lady when Beaueaire started his woo-
ing ; and she suffered from intermittent de-
spair of what to do with her hands. Later,
when, in the thawing of Lady Carlisle’s heart,

she was given opportunities to be emotional,
her work showed greater ease and sincerity.
Frank Harvey’s Beaucaire was an artistic
performance that might fall short of his pre-
decessors’, but stands very well by itself, ex-
cept for an inclination to forget that he
was a Frenchman when swift action was
accompanied by rapid words. The represen-
tation of the sincere Major Molyneux by
Kenneth Brampton was one of the chief
successes; the velvet glove might have been
more in evidence in Sydney Stirling’s Beau
Nash; and Mayne Lynton introduced plain
melodrama into costume as the Duke of
Winterset. J. B. Atholwood marred good
work (he was Mr. Bicksitt) by walking now
and again on his wounded leg after the man-
agement had considerately supplied him with
a crutch. G. Kay Souper, as Captain Badger,
a part which would have been more suitable
to an actor built on bulldog instead of grey-
hound lines, was good ; Herbert Leigh (Mar-
quis de Mirepoix) was excellent; and some
of the others, including the women (but ex-
cepting Emma Temple as Mrs. Marsley),
were too confidential about their lines.
$ $
Partly because his son has been sent
to college and acquired socialistic views,
and partly to avoid a strike in his factory
a: a precarious time, “Bull-head” Bauer
agrees to the institution of some sort of com-
munistic system in his fruit-packing factory;
and how it partly succeeds, but mostly does
not, is the theme of “Give and Take,” which
opened at Sydney Criterion on Saturday.
Aaron Hoffman, who writes farces, is one
of the most serious-minded men in the world ;
at the back of his fun there is nearly always
an appeal, often almost pathetic, for better
understanding between peoples at war. Here
he offers, in a feast of laughter, the sug-
gestion that “give and take” should be the
principle between employer and employee.
There is a more solid plot than is offered
by many a more pretentiously-presented play ;
but the fact that it is put forward as farce
enables Roy Rene, now that he has got
used to playing a real part, to take over-
much advantage of opportunities for knock-
about humor. The well-constructed plot is
full enough of fun to keep the house rocking
with laughter without the extravagances Roy
Rene is inclined to introduce. Harry Green,
as John Bauer, manages to contribute to the
laughter without the exaggeration which
would spoil such moments of pathos as when
he represents the heartbreak of a man who
has devoted 30 years to a business he now
sees crumbling about him. His work is
full of artistry. A small but capable cast
supports him; as the one woman in the cast,
Marion Kruger, Lorna Helms shows a simple
sincerity that proves her as capable in
“straight” parts as in the humorous char-
acters in which she has been seen.

Sydney’s newest picture-show :
After having established what seemed a life interest
in the Archibald prize by winning it four years in
succession, W. B. Mclnnes pulled out this year;
and the palm (in plain English £541) has been
awarded to John Longstaff for a portrait of Maurice
Moscovitch. It is a fine bit of work, but less a
portrait than a picture. In any case, it is open to
grave doubt whether such an award fulfils the
intention of the founder ; it was not only the art of
portrait painting that Archibald desired to encourage
among Australians, but the painting of Austra-
lian portraits. Amongst the other 74 exhibits
there is the usual number of grotesqueries, including
a lady who is all paint, puff's and podginess, several
who are mostly angularities, and a schoolmaster who,
standing with a stiff slab of red in his hand, evi-
dently meant for a book, may find it hard to forgive
the relative who has caricatured him. Lambert has
several good efforts; one is George Judah Cohen,
looking as if he has just gone through a balance sheet
showing a 12 per cent, dividend and a big amount
passed to reserves. The work is vigorous and the
detail delightful, although the curious close per-
spective gives an impression that the red inkpot may
slip off a sloping table and stain the rich caipet.

Whilst Marie Burke reigns in “Katja” at
Sydney Majesty’s, there is no sign of revolu-
tion at that theatre.

The reality of the Devonshire atmosphere
created by “The Farmer's Wife” at Sydney
Palace may he gathered from the remark that
cut the silence of a pause last week: “And
that reminds me, John ; don’t forget to tell
Jones to send us some cream for Sunday.”

“Cinderella” continues to get herself into
trouble at the Grand Opera House (Syd-
ney) ; but tinselly fairies who dive into real
water to retrieve the slipper help to turn
her troubles into happiness. That real water
seems, this hot weather, like the best of all
pantomime inspiration.

If Alexander Selkirk could see the things
that are done in the name of “Robinson
Crusoe” at Fullers’ Theatre (Sydney) he
would probably apply for a writ of prohibi-
tion. But Selkirk is dead, and the show is
very much alive; which circumstances are all
to the advantage of the children whose
laughter fills the theatre.
Bebe Daniels, with eyes that look as if
they are prepared to brim with tears, carries
all before her in “The Manicure Girl,” at
Hoyt’s Sydney house. A meretricious film,
but with much “heart interest.” Harold
Lloyd in “Why Worry?” at the Lyceum, falls
short of the standard he has made for him-
self ; yet, because he can give a brighter
laugh than any other picture-actor of to-day,
the criticism is only comparative. Scara-
mouche,” at the Prince Edward, is full of
thrill.
** * *
In the interests of the public an Act
should be passed prohibiting artists from in-
viting audiences to “join in the chorus.” It
is a habit in England, where it often goes
well; but Australian audiences are different,
pnd here the invitation leads merely to feeble
responses and much dulness. Both Billy
Maloney and Lily Morris are trying it at
Sydney Tivoli this week, the lady achieving
the better success, which is nothing to speak
about. The robustious Lily is to be trans-
planted very soon. Katrina of the musical
legs and Joan of the wonderful toes also
finish this week. Meanwhile Ralph Holbein
provides a very entertaining, clever turn in
lightning “painting” for which he uses all
sorts of articles, including fragments of rag,
besides colors.

A motor-show in Sydney:—
There were unhappy auguries about the motor-
show now open at the Sydney Agricultural Ground;
the gloomy prophets foresaw that at an off-time be-

PALACE.

Clarke, whom the stork brought.
tween Christmas and Easter very few firms would
exhibit. But if there are absentees their absence is
not noticed amongst the dazzling array of cars on
view. The exhibits include everything from motor-
cycles, trucks and ’buses to wonderfully-finished
private cars with interiors furnished like a drawing-
room—saddle-back chairs that can be pushed away
when not in use, cut-glass vases for flowers and
Scores of unsuspected knick-knacks. Thei\: are
even cars whose drawingroom interiors can be
converted into bedrooms in emergency. The show is
a revelation of the ingenuity that can be displayed
in supplying comfort for those able to pay for it,
and in putting to use every available niche so that
your car can carry a hundred cunning little conveni-
ences. Practically all the bodywork producing these
results is made in Australia, and it is interesting
to know that the body-builders use four million
pounds’ worth of Australian material every year.
Where such fine work is produced there should be
no difficulty in producing the mechanical parts of
the car also.
* * * *
In a week destitute of first nights at the
usual addresses, the matinee show at Fed-
eral Parliament House came as a blessing to
the freelance pen. The staging left nothing to
be desired. The guard of mounted rifles, the
band, the vice-regal equipage with outriders
in white wigs and liveries, the master of
ceremonies in real Irish lace and the comic
relief who staggered about under the mace
displayed a perfect knowledge of their parts;
and, although some of the new supers turned
up in their working clothes, this must be
ascribed to democratic idiosyncrasy rather
than to disrespect for the occasion. The heavy
lead, Lord Stonehaven (his first appearance),
who was clamped into a Restoration cos-
tume of blue and gold, read his lines clearly
and firmly, and, considering the generally-
empty nature of the script, with much more
emotion than might have been expected. The
chorus, selected, as usual, for their good looks
rather than their vocal accomplishments, con-
sisted of a six-foot-five Highlander and char-
acters representing various English regi-
ments, and were effectively grouped at the
back of the stage, flanked on one side by a
gentleman in a full-bottomed wig and an air
of dreamy detachment, and on the other by
an Usher of the Black Rod without the rod.
The somewhat drab appearance of the other
performers, whom a jealous people insists on
having clad in sad sac suits and any sort of
hat, nevertheless provided the right contrast
for the rest of the glittering pageant.
Stalls, circle and boxes were crammed with
as many of the 6,000,000 authors of the
piece as could be accommodated, and
although they were not asked to speak after
the curtain, this is in accordance with pre-
cedent, which provides that they shall be
heard from only once in three years. An ex-
cellent spread was provided by the manage-
ment after the first act. The show will con-
tinue, afternoon and evening, indefinitely.
The total cost of the production for one year,
as far as can be gathered from the Common-
wealth Year Book, 1925, is round about
£350,000.
Sampled once again, “Lilac Time” at
Melbourne Royal seems improved. The re-
surrection of John Ralston is one of the
surprises of the show. As the shy music-
maker he displays histrionic talent of the
rarest, coupled with a charming voice. Har-
riet Bennet is also singing herself into favor.

What games-goers expected of a gladiator
in the days of ancient Rome is nothing to
what the modern vaudeville “fan” expects
of his amusers. At Melbourne Tivoli this
week the Ivarreys are doing inexplicable
things with their very magnificent bodies.
One, without showing any signs of perturba-
tion. drives his torso into his diaphragm,
much as if his body were a concertina;
another deliberately and with malice afore-
thought dislocates his left shoulder while
babies scream and strong men say, “Streuth!”
setting it again without putting the manage-
ment to the expense of calling in a surgeon.

ing. On Friday night the Veterans of

A sub-committee of the moribund British
film industry recommended a few months ago
that every hirer of film should be compelled
after October, 1926, to show Ift. of British
celluloid for every 9ft. of the imported rub-
bish, the ratio to rise to Ift. of British to
oft. of foreign by July, 1929. John Bull’s
Ministers are looking at the proposal in a
kindly manner, so, in the absence of any in-
dustry in Australia, this country can see its
film wants being supplied bv Britain in a
larger degree. The quality of the infrequent
British film becomes therefore of interest. A

SERVICE
He receives the greatest reward who most successfully adapts his service lo
the general need. Every man who enters into trade proclaims, voluntarily or
involuntarily, that he was not sent into this world to wait upon himself; but to
find his own welfare in working for his neighbor.
A man does not learn to make shoes because he has a fancy to wear a new
pair every day, but because he knows that all people need shoes. A Bank does
not gather money together just for the sake of hoarding it in safes. It gathers
money together in order that it may be more profitably employed—in other words
it makes your money work so that it shall earn rather more than its keep—and
passes the profit thus made to you in the form of interest.

end on a note of domestic happiness renewed.
The difference between this English example
of film artistry and the sort that comes from

that a change of masters is going to have
much value for this country. The English

Some new-zoological specimens:—
Melbourne National Gallery has just acquired
under the Felton bequest three white elephants.
The price paid was £2500, and the size of the
animals is considerable. One has a height of loft.
3in. and a breadth of lift. 6in., and owing to short-
age of space only two are on exhibition. The third
is eating its head off in obscurity in the basement.
The pair at large are hanging in a hallway about
the dimensions of a St. Kilda flat, and the effort to
get far enough away to see all parts of their
anatomy at once involves the student in a spirited
encounter with the opposite wall. They are, in
fact, rough drawings in monochrome by the celebrated
Puvis de Chavannes (1842-1898) for his famous
wall-paintings depicting St. Genevieve bringing
bread and butter to the starving Parisians blockaded
by the Franks. This commentator has seen the
finished paintings in the Paris Pantheon, where the
angular composition, which is both Chavannes’
strength and weakness, with his unostentatious color-
ing, help the architecture of a noble building. In
the already-overtaxed confines of the Melbourne
gallery, which already has specimens of the artist’s
work, these three cartoons are as out of place as a
full-grown Gippsland gum in a suburban garden
devoted to the cultivation of chrysanthemums. Their
presence will still further postpone the chances of
Australian artists’ pictures getting the look-in on
the gallery’s walls they so badly need.

Adelaide pictures appeal openly to the
feminine vote this week with “Fine Clothes,”
bracketed with “The Reckless Sex” at Won-
dergraph, and “Sinners in Silk” at West's--
where also one Imito makes agreeable bird-
noises on the stage. At the York, Jackie.
Coogan is an appealing figure in his Irish-
American partnership with a Hebrew “Rag
Man,” and Richard Dix does some exciting
stunts on a lofty, scaffolding. At the mo-
ment Nellie Bramley is rollicking in “Peg
o’ My Heart” at the Royal. But she has
lately been intense in “Bought and Paid
For,’ which also gave a real chance to Guy
Hastings, who has been cleverly playing a
variety of small parts in the other pieces.
Similarly “Peg” gives a fair chance to
George Hewlett as hero.
“M.G.S.”: E. E. Shauer, general manager
of Paramount Pictures in U.SIA., at present
in Melbourne, handed out some interesting
particulars about the scope of his company’s
operations. In Uncle Samland 20 million
fans view the pictures in 16.000 theatres, and
for foreign purposes the headlines are trans-
lated into 37 languages. He did not explain
why English was omitted.
‘‘C. Ockney” : The stage is overcrowded,
hut one seldom hears of a mummer having
once tasted grease-paint being anxious to
leave the boards and make room for some-
one else. Such a miracle happened in Eng-
land recently, as witness a “Situations
Wanted” advertisement in a London paper:—
“As working housekeeper, by stage girl, sick
of the j0b.... Highest refei’ences.” If they
only knew what their audiences thought of
them, what a host of others would get sick
of their jobs!
“Paree”: Although Sweden has only a
trifle more population than Australia and
not a tithe of our natural advantages, it is
famous for its output of films. Selma Lager l
lof’s romance, “The Atonement of Gosta
Berling,” which won her a Nobel prize, has
been made into a fine picture on its native
soil. On the thing reaching America Holly-
wood bought up the leading actor and
actress and the producer; but there are
others just as good in Sweden, and they can
earn a decent living in their own country,
which protects its' film industry against the
Hollywood blight. Australia is not so wise.

HEADING HIM OFF.
P IERROT: “Ah! The burning, throbbing pain that
comes from my aching”
P IERRETTE: “Poor boy! Why don’t you get the
dentist to pull it out ?"
From Beatrice Day :
Much could still be written of the late Arthur
Styan’s splendid work in Australia. Mention oi
“Mr. Wu,” his finest impersonation, recalls that,
during the all-too-short ruti of that play, Ellen Terry
sat watching a performance from one of the boxes.
When the curtain fell on the last act, she asked to
be brought to my dressing-room. Almost her first
words were: “I thought I had seen ‘Mr. Wu’ played
to perfection in London. I have never seen it played
until to-night. I want to be introduced.” The
venerable Ellen met as many of the members as were
visible, and, with charming expressions of praise
for Mr. Stvan, the company and the beautiful pro-
duction, said good-night. “How I wish the author
could be here to see it!” she exclaimed at parting.
Miss Terry came again twice, and sat in the stalls,
where she said she could enjoy the whole of the
acting. In the cast were Cyril Mackay, now passed
O'er, Esther Mitchell (as Mr. Wu’s daughter) and
Reginald Wykeham. I wish the Firm would revive
that play: it.is. one of the finest in its great reper-
toire.
“Hiphen”: The new “Aladdin,” now
raging in Melbourne, makes one long for
the old ’un. The principals are recruited
from the Tivoli circuit. They are no doubt
frightfully good in vaudeville, but panto,
is too serious for them. To be impartial I
must admit that there is one bright and
original stunt in a show which has many
depressing moments. The Dame sings a
song and then invites the audience to join
the chorus. First the ladies, then the
gents.; then the married men, then the
bachelors; then right side of house, then
left. This made such a hit with the new
producer (Mr. Rolls —but not Royce) that
the. Principal Boy later had a shot at the
same stunt: Presently the Comic ..Villain
tried his hand. A bit later the Dame and
the Principal Boy worked it together, and
on the principle that you can’t get enough
of a good thing, especially when it’s so new
and fresh, the Dame had another go with
variations, hand-clapping and shouting being
suggested in place of vocal effort. I may
be getting old and mouldy, but. I like more
body in my panto. Of course there is plenty
of body in “Aladdin,” and it’s not too much
covered. But when I recall the panto, of
70 or SO years ago. . ..
“Geo Rich” : Died in Perth Hospital after
an operation, Billy Warner, who claimed to
have organised more benefits than anyone
else in Australia. Born in the Cabbage
Garden, he went to Groperland in ’96. As
a variety entertainer of considerable ver-
satility, Billy was popular on the boards in
Melbourne 30-odd years ago. His great hit
was the song “Brannigan.” He was a cousin
of “Plum” Warner, the cricketer, and was
67 when the curtain fell.
“Schnorrer”: Cantor Joseph Rosenblatt,
of the Temple Emmanu-El, New York —pro-
bably the richest synagogue in the world —
has gone bankrupt. Rosenblatt gets 10,000
dollars a year as “chazan” and
considerably more for making
gramophone records. Not long
ago lie declined an offer of
10,000 dollars for a series of
five concerts —he said that his
voice was “dedicated to the
service of God.” Keeping open
house for his friends and the
poor of his neighborhood was
the cause of his financial diffi-
culties. The beauty of the old-
fashioned chanting is still pre-
served in synagogue worship,
and the cantor who leads it,
as well as singing some of the
main items of the ritual, is a
man of importance. There are
several cantors whose fame is
widespread, but Rosenblatt is
the daddy of them all. Rev.
M. Einfeld, chazan of the Syd-
ney Great Synagogue, who has
a fine voice, is probably the
Australian top-notcher.
“E.T.”: “Walker, London,”
which in the judgment of its
author would be “better dead,”
was originally called “The
Houseboat.” But a prior
claim having been established
by a little-known dramatist
named H. W. Williamson, who
had not only produced, but
also- published, his “House-
boat,” Barrie and Toole set
about re-christening the piece.
One day at rehearsal Toole
was on the point of speaking
the “tag”—a thing that theat-
rical people look upon as fatal
to success—which happened to
be “Walker, London.” Barry
stopped him in time. “Don’t,
Johnny,” he said, “I want
that for my title.” It proved
a happy selection, and the play
enjoyed a long run. Mary
Ansell (later Mrs. Barrie)
and a pushing young particle
named Seymour Ilicks ap-
peared in the cast.
‘Cicsar s Ghost - ’: Muriel Starr, who first
appeared in Australia in 1913—the play was
the often-revived “Within the Law” —and,
with small breaks, has remained ever since,
has no intention of leaving the land of sun-
shine and tolerant audiences. In March
she will assemble most of the people who
have been with her during the last year,
and some others, for an Australasian ven-
ture of her own, which will start off with
French Leave,” here introduced by Emilie
Polini. Meantime Muriel is resting a voice
in which the overstrain of much violent
emotion has grown noticeable, and she may
mop out a few of the sobs which will not
be required by Julie, the lady of the
“French Leave” play.
“Curtain Raiser”: While Melba has been
singing her farewell to England J.C.W.,
Ltd., is flattering itself that it has discovered
a successor to her. She is Winnie Amelia
Baquie. a 15-year-old Melbourne thrush, aiid
the Firm is so satisfied with her soprano that'
it is footing the entire bill for sending her
and her teacher to Italy. They left last
week by the Orama.
Walter Baker introduces a candidate:—
An Australian playwright whose work is shortly to
find its way to the stage is R. O. Blackman. Neil
and Tuohey have two of his comedies on the stocks,
and Billy Russell also has a play of his in hand.
Blackman, who is best known for his Pinero enthu-
siasms, has written many plays, some of which make
very good reading. I have read them, and found
“Plain Eliza,” “Beauty for Sale,” and “The Silver
Spoon” well worth attention.
“Drought": The Reginald Goode drama
mentioned by “Caesar’s Ghost” (B. 14/l/’26)
has already been produced in America. It
was given a trial spin at Bethlehem, and
was then taken for a week to the Scranton j
Academy. The piece was to have been 1
brought to New York at the end of Novem-
ber, if all went well. The cast included
Cyril Keightley. “White Gold," another
Australian play, by somebody called J.
Palmer Parsons, had its Broadway premiere'
on November 2, and earned such mixed criti-
cisms that it is impossible to say what the
chances were of its having anything like a
decent run.
“Major Honeybutter”: An actress well-
known nowadays was a beginner in an
Allan Wilkie co. of which the late Jack
Cosgrove was a member. Cosgrove, as he
assured her, was always trying to help her
out of stage difficulties; but, somehow, the
more suggestions he made the deeper she
seemed to progress in the mire. The good
Samaritan overdid it at last. One evening,
just before curtain-rise, he stopped the
novice. “Good God, my dear!” he exclaimed
excitedly, “where is the ‘black-out’? Yon
have forgotten to bring the ‘black-out’!”
“McAmfat”: Sean O’Casey's “Juno and
the Payeock” (B. 7/l/’26) opens in comedy
but ends in tragic gloom. This, following on
other examples of morbidity, has prompted
a London critic to discover a stage affinity
between the Irishman and the Russian. Per-
haps the great Russian 1 writers are (or were)
Irishmen. I suggest to David McKee Wright
that Tolstoi is a Russian corruption of a
good old Irish name, and that the author of
“Anna Karenina” really belonged to the
Irish- family of the O’Tooles, of Tooley-
street, or wherever the O’Tooles come from.
And what is Gorky but McGoorty thinly dis-
guised? The parents of McGoorty, alias
Gorky, christened him Alicksei (otherwise
Alick McGoorty), and one of his early books
was called “The Orloff (i.c., McAuliffe)
Couple and Malva (Molly).” Such facts
speak for themselves.
“Sigs” : The contemporary buckjump show-
man keeps animals of better quality and con-
dition than the poor but game and faithful
performers of past years. Weary, underfed
and tucked up after road-travel between
“pitches” were those slaves of the ring in
many—too many—cases; often it took a
flankrope and all the staff’s lung-power to
urge them to prop and pigroot straight ahead.’
Now and then some questionable assistance
had to be given to prevent quite ordinary
local riders from making a show of the show-
men’s “outlaw's.” To-day a full team of
well-nourished prads is kept so that each
may face the music fresh and w r ith a sport-
ing chance of dumping the district champion.
The cute showman “words” likely-looking
aspirants to “hop off before the finish if he
bucks w r ell,” and most of the lads oblige, so the
horses are never cowed. But can no one in
the business invent a quick-acting blindfold
to displace the cheap, dirty and often useless
bag?
“Schnorrer”: The Jewish re-settlement of
Palestine—immigrants are now arriving at
the rate of 33,000 p.a.—is being supplied
with plenty of musical accompaniment.
Jascha Ileifitz, asked to co-operate with
other Jewish celebrities in establishing a
Conservatorium of Music in Palestine, under-
took to provide a concert-hall at his own
expense and to give five recitals every year
for the Conservatorium building fund. And
Chaliapine, w 7 ho is coming to Australia, de-
voted the proceeds of a Paris concert—-the
only one at which he sang in the Gay City
last year—to the musical side of the Zionist
movement. Solomon employed expert musi-
cians to make joyful noises during the build-
ing of the original Temple. History is re-
peating itself in a curious fashion.
“Flaming Youth”: Now strutting the
boards in the cause of villainy is an actor
who, when the robes of virtue sat upon him,
was the worst leading man I knew. His
roo-fruity voice and gawky manner of up-
ending his arms, as if stretching to pick
leaves from the sky, gave offence in many
places; and the just word was wafted to
him during a melodrama in which the
villain, stick in hand, leapt upon him iu the
second act. After striking the atmosphere
savagely, the malefactor staggered back. “I
have killed him!” he ejaculated in a hoarse
whisper. From the back of the theatre came
a fervent “Thank God!”
A NEW EDEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘People regard love-making as something shameful
that mustn’t be mentioned,’ said the Rev. Mr. Pat-
ton, addressing the Hull Free Church Council, ‘The
Church should assume responsibility for guiding the
irresistible force in love-making along the right
channels, giving Christian sanctification and encour-
agement and providing lovers with meeting-places
within its blessings and security.’”— Cable.
The church is decked with garlands green
And hanging sprigs of mistletoe,
To hasten lovers who are slow'.
In nave and aisle and pews are seen,
By dim religious lights and low.
Pairs of enraptured swains and misses
Enjoying pulpit-sanctioned kisses.
The very vestry holds its pair;
Behind the lectern you may view
A couple playing bill-and-coo;
The parson stalking here and there
Counts weddings that are shortly due,
Content that there is no transgressing
When lovers have the Church’s blessing.
Yet from this Eden some will stray, - ,
Lovers who hie them to the dark
Secluded spots within the park,
Remarking as they go their way:
“How can that darned old silly nark
Towards the altar have us harried,
Seeing we’re both already married?”

The World’s most popular car
at the lowest price in Australia
THE Ford policy is being demon-
strated in a convincing way to-day,
now that the New Ford Touring Car
has not only been improved in appear-
ance and comfort, but has been reduced
to such a remarkably low price.
This is an opportunity that no sensible
man will overlook. It makes available
the world’s most popular and reliable
car at a price that is not only the lowest
in Australia, but on terms that are
within the reach of every man in the
Commonwealth.
Complete enjoyment of motor owner-
ship is only possible when you have a
good-looking car, reliable in perform-

ance, economical to run and whose cost
is within your income.
It is because the majority of people
realise this that twelve million —over
half the world’s motorists to-day—use
the Ford. Nowhere is the ability of
the Ford to stand hardest service and
get through under all conditions more
forcibly demonstrated than in Australia.
The Ford is the safest investment. It is
protected by universal Ford service
through 450 Dealers and 2000 Ford
Service Stations.

HEMPEL
records exclusively
for the
NEW EDISON
The world’s greatest soprano has been an Edison
artiste since 1918! All her new recordings are
Edison. Edison alone has her famous “Jenny Lind”
numbers —“Casta Diva,” “Non mi dir” and
Thrane’s “Kom Kjyra” (the Norwegian Echo Song).
which tradition states the soprano sang so wonder-
fully that her audience could not believe their ears.
Those who have heard Frieda Hempel’s glorious voice ask no
explanation of her elusive yet enduring charm. They only know that
she sings straight into their hearts songs they will never forget.
Australia will soon be privileged to see her exquisite personality—
but every home may enjoy the privilege of hearing her voice any time
they wish. It will come to them—not merely reproduced, but
re-created with every golden tonal quality intact. Real music—great
artists —the New Edison gives you both.


This sketch was purchased from
J. Jonsson, a former pupil of
the Weston School, now on art
staff of Smith’s Weekly.
DRAWING IS PROFITABLE
The Weston method of
teaching drawing by post
is the most successful, be-
cause Mr. Weston teaches
his students to DRAW, not
to copy.
Many Weston pupiis earn
money before they complete
the course, whilst several
successful Australian artists
owe their first training to
the Weston School.

don t say it....A.C.M.: Another threw his line in
first and got a passable fish... .0.G.H.: Sorry, but
have no means of testing it Junius: The ex-
banker who advised the finder of valuable lost pro-
perty to keep it until a reward was offered was
counselling something not only dishonest but illegal.

you do it very amusingly Torch: You have left

And why will you jamb your typewritten lines so
close together? Millicent A.: Thank you; but it
is interesting only in a local way, and this paper
has to feed a continent A.L.P.: Too much pre-
liminary song-and-dance. Without the first two long
pars it might suit Jock G.: Too late. .. .T.E.H.;
It certainly seems a terrible indictment of the
whole business;
You are after to insure it
With a crowd called reputable men,
But they don’t pay the brass till you’re under the
grass,
And it’s no blooming good to you then.
There’s that table which you call a Lifer ;
While I live I can’t handle no cash;
Yet as soon as I hop it I’m leaving big profits
ror another to make a big splash.
That Endowment Insurance, as I view it
It’s me who’d be taking the risk,
k°s when I go to collect all you tell me I’ll get,
Three to one the company will twist.
And that Accident Policy you tell me about,
Where they pay you a wage if you get fairly
knocked out,
But if you tell ’em you died from one of the Ills
they Perscribe—
M ell, the one that has killed you won’t count.

R.S. (Coorow); No wonder the lady dances and
prances if you read her verse as bad as that
li.H. (Redfern): A commonplace account of not
very unusual trickery... .Kitty B.; Not for this
sixpenn’orth. .. .W.C.T.; Some-of the lines are very
rocky. Can’t you improve them? Gerald P.:
Not up by a long way 0.E.8.; Feeble verse
ending in a bad rhyme... .M.G. (Bendigo): It hasn’t

Not the sort of yarn we hunger for... .A.M.N.Z.:
The story is rubbish and the presentation of it poor.

Not nearly good enough... .J.R.L.: This paper

examples are gladly paid for if claimed for.

genei al interest.... Geo. K.: Terrible.... AL R ■
About 10 versions of the same tale have been told

thin in thought and loose in form Thomas C.:

Pars should be short, crisp and pointed. .. .T.T.R.:
The form of the octave is bad, and so is its grammar.
J.S.D.: A good idea; see if you can handle it
better Verna W.: The verse creaks and jolts a
good deal Una C.: None of them well enough
done L.D. (Mildura): Thin, weak stuff without
ideas Wingadee: Seems rather like a yell from
a soap-box, and the terms of the order to “Get out”
are a bit indefinite Emel: It finishes on a good

"My heart with pleasure thrills
And dances with the daffodils”
When penning these lines Wordsworth must have felt in a rather
exultant mood. A heart that wants to go jazzing with the daffo-
dils is unusually rare, and what a merry old world this would
be if we could all have those feelings. But, modern conditions
of living intervene. The constant race against time means
hurried and irregular meals, which in time claim their pitiless
toll in the form of Acute Indigestion
And it’s when the digestive organs become clogged with poisonous
secretions that those dull, nagging pains in the stomach arise.
Headaches, constipation and despondence follow—life doesn’t
seem to be worth living
In this state yon require a true service medicine, such as that reliable old family jnend

“Ivriz”: No attempt has ever been made
to establish a button-making factory in
Broome (W.A.), although the paths around
all the houses are strewn with broken shell
that might have been used for this purpose.
Australia produces some of the finest pearl-
shell in the world, but it is shipped away
to foreign countries, and in return we get
inferior buttons made from inferior shell.
There are numerous side-lines which could
be established were buttons made in Broome,
but we leave the industry to the Yanks.

“Machete”: Queensland, the first of the
States to make the issue of banknotes a
State monopoly—Hugh Nelson took the step
•after the bank smashes of IS93 —has just
been holding a post mortem. When the
Federal Government took over the note issue
in 1910, State notes were in circulation to
the value of £1,624,105. These have gradu-
ally been redeemed by the Treasury and de-
stroyed, until only £20,000 worth is out-
standing to-day. Last year saw only 200-
odd of these tattered and decrepit chickens
return to the old roost in the Treasury, and
officialdom reckons that fire and flood and
ordinary wear and tear have accounted for
most of riie balance.
“Copabella”: A vocation for girls which
is peculiarly Queenslandish is that of sugar
chemist. The value of his cane to the grower
is ascertained by a chemical test for “com-
mercial content of sugar,” popularly known
as C.G.S. Each mill has its squad of sugar-
chemists, for the cane must be tested not less
frequently than at every 30 tons treated, and,
lest they pay too highly, most mills test
oftcner. To safeguard growers’ interests
there is also an official, responsible to the
Government, who checks and o.k’s the work
of the mill tester. This check-chemist is fre-
quently a girl; sometimes not much beyond
flapper age. The work is interesting, and
the salary may be £7 a week.
“S.T.S.”: As yet another instance of Mark
Twain’s old claim that figures can be made
to prove anything, take the rainfall statistics
of South Aus. for 1925. Everybody in-
terested knows that it was a particularly dry
year; yet the figures make it rainy beyond
the average. The explanation is that, of
Adelaide's total of close on 22 inches, be-
tween five and six fell in one tropical lunch-
hour in February, and did no lasting good.
A more important point is the renewed proof
that to a wheat-growing country the winter
and spring rain is all that is vital. The first
three and the last three months of 1925
were—except for the storm above mentioned
—practically rainless; but a mere 12 or 13
inches during the months that count were
enough to assure an average harvest.
“Julian”: Some people are never satisfied,
however good a wicket they are on. In the
boom days of the Westralian goldfields, when
all drinks were a bob and the wholesale
charges correspondingly high, the manage-
ment of one beer-factory juggled with the
casks to increase profits. The ordinary hogs-
head of commerce holds 54 gallons, but they
set their coopers to work to knock up casks
with a capacity of 56 gallons, in which the
beer was delivered to Bung, who paid for the
actual contents. The brewery people, how-
ever, paid excise duty on the reputed con-
tents only, so that two gallons of wallop in
every cask got into circulation duty free. In
summer, when the delivery-lorries were work-
ing overtime to catch up to the thirst of the
diorite-punchers and the mulga-stranglers, the
discrepancy was highly profitable for the
brewery until a dismissed employee
and the heavy hand of the law
descended on the offenders.
“M.G.S.”: W. Carlyle MacDougall, in the
current issue of The Alfred, the interesting
quarterly of the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne,
discusses 'the Australian position with re-
gard to radium. The whole world has as
yet produced only Boz. and 240 z. is the entire
present stock. Considering the value of the
stuff and its scarcity, it is gratifying to know
that in S. Australia are two distinct deposits
—at Radium Hill, Olary, and at Mount
Painter, in the Northern Flinders Ranges.
They are the only two spots on the globe
where the precious mineral is found in lode.
Two companies have had a shot at treating
it, but radium recovery is a slow process,
needing much faith and more capital. Up
to date 2J tons of ore have been treated. It
takes six months of treatment after the ore
lias been received for radium to be won.
The final stage is in view, and the radium
bromide extracted is now being tested at
Adelaide University. The potential value of
the finds in hard cash is indicated by the
fact that the Alfred, which owns one of the
finest X-ray outfits south of the line, is pay-
ing £4OOO for 250 milligrammes from abroad.
“Northerner”: According to loose news-
paper talk, Queensland swarms with mil-
lionaires —sheep kings, cattle kings, mining
kings, pearl kings and so on—but the income-
tax people find it hard to locate them. Only
73 Queenslanders (including absentees) con-
fessed to an income of over £lO,OOO from all
sources for the financial year 1924-25. Wool
is the one great source of Queensland’s
wealth, and 61 of the 73 ten-tl],ousand-
pounders are sheep pastoralists: average
gross income, £30,937; taxable income,
£17,742, reduced to £14,671 by State income-
tax. The biggest income of all (£108,285
gross; £80.258 taxable) was drawn by a
cattle pastoralist, who was called upon to
pay £14,322 as State tax. Two absentees
paid tax on £35,333 between them; three
cane farmers cut up £49,787 taxable income;
two persons of independent means divided
£23,743; and two “employees” (undefined)
drew £39,567. The only other big incomes
in the list are: Commission agent, £15,954;
wholesale manufacturer, £10,428. The aggre-
gate gross income of the whole 73 was
£2.277,242; taxable income, £1.333,377. The
State! tax on the lot was £229,993.

It is noticeable that the

“T. 0.1.”: In starting on their experi-
mental journey across the Blue Mountains
in 1813, Blaxlaud, Wentworth and Lawson
were accompanied as far as “Emu Island’’
by “two other gentlemen’’ and four servants.
Can any Bulletin reader name these six or
any of them?
Australia’s first citizen of Italian birth
to apply for naturalisation seems to have
been Dominique Popolare, a native of Cala-
bria, who sent the request in from Bathurst
in May, 1846. He had then been over 35
years in N.S.W., having been sent out in
1809 for a military offence committed while
he was serving in the garrison at Malta.
A Queensland Judge not so very long dead
was rung up at court one day by his wife,
who told him with much agitation that their
house had been burned to the ground. “Don’t
distress yourself,” said the Judge soothingly :
“everything is fully insured.” It wasn’t till
later that he discovered that his wife, think-
ing it waste of money to pay insurance, had
used the premiums as an extra dress-allow-
ance.
Maoriland’s fathers in Israel hold their
jobs well. Van Stavern, who recently cele-
brated the 50th anniversary of his marriage
and has been half a century Rabbi in Wel-
lington, is seconded in length of service by
the Rev. S. A. Goldstein, shepherd of the
Auckland Hebrews, who has just completed
his 45th year as pastor. Only two men have
had the Auckland job, Moses Elkin officiat-
ing from the early ’fifties till 18S0.
“Kir”: The death of Mrs. Dykes-Marshall,
granddaughter of Governor Fitzroy, starts a
trail of memory that leads to an exhibit in the
museum of the Railway Institute in Sydney.
It is a spade used by Mrs. Dykes-Marshall’s
mother on a historic occasion; and it now
bears the following inscription: “This spade,
manufactured in Sydney, N.S.W., of
materials indigenous to Australia, was used
by the Hon. Mrs. Keith Stuart, daughter of
Sir Charles Fitzroy, Governor-in-Chief of
the Colony and its Dependencies, for cutting
the first turf of the First Railway in Aus-
tralia, at Sydney, 3rd July, 1850.”
“R.N.C.”: In London recently I had occa-
sion to visit the library at the British
Museum. A fine plaque has been erected in
the entrance hall to the memory of librarians
killed in the World War. Among Australian
names are those of C. J. Connell, Parliament
Library, Brisbane; S. D. J. Figgis, Public
Library, Melbourne; D. J. Mackay, Sydney ;
J. Pierce, Sydney; J. T. Swain, D.C.M.,
Melbourne. The plaque, which consists of
five panels, contains 150 names, and is in-
scribed :
In Memory of British Librarians fallen in the
war 1914-1918.
Valkte Fratres.
The end of a picturesque swmnker camo
when Captain de Courcy Bower died in
London lately. He dissipated nearly three
millions .in a few years. It was in 1911
that, going to Monte Carlo with £27.000, he
broke the bank three times in one day and
cleaned up £243,ooo—the £27,000, by the
way, was the remnant of a fortune of a
million and a half, made in South America,
and a million belonging to his wife, the
daughter of a Hungarian nobleman. One of
Bower’s extravagances was giving away £lOO
notes as tips; one waiter alone made £20,000
out of him. His Monte Carlo money lasted
only a few months, and after lingering on to
see 1926 he died in poverty.
“Clerk”: Brisbane City Council's appoint-
ment of a rat-catcher at £6OO a year (B.
31/12/'25) convicts Vic. Railway Commis-
sioner Clapp of shamefully slighting a noble
profession. The Vic. railways rat-catcher-in-
chief, ex-pug. Paddy Moran, who took the job
in 1921 during the bubonic plague scare, re-
ceives only a paltry sixpence a day more
than the ordinary laborer. He has to cast
a watchful eye on departmental property all
over the State, and finds enough work to
keep an assistant and eight dogs in a state
of feverish activity. Clapp said of him
lately: “He has cleaned up some corners
which I regarded as hopeless.”
“10618”: The Germans have been giving
their greatest war aviator, Von Richtofen, a
national funeral. He had a score of 80 to his
credit when he came down. There was great
argument as to who got him. The Wood-
bines put in a claim, so did the Aus : sie air-
men, but the 39th Mug Gunners were gener-
ally assigned the distinction. He was buried
in the little cemetery at Bertangles with a
four-blade tractor (three of the blades cut
short and capped with aluminium) forming
an improvised cross. The epitaph was en-
graved in German above and English below
and dubbed him “Cavalry-Captain Baron von
Richtofen.” The airmen of the various Allied
squadrons sent everlasting wreaths. It
wasn’t long before someone had souvenired
the epitaph ; the aluminium caps went next.
Next time I saw the grave someone had
written on the lighter wood of the cross
“This man died for his country.” The grave
was never again touched. I wonder if any
Aussie reader has that epitaph among liis
war souvenirs!
Just returned to the Tremulous Islands
after a year abroad, Dr. H. T. J. Thacker, of
Christchurch, whose reappearance should
put ginger into the affairs of the flat town.
Thacker made his best bid for fame in the
early months of the Avar when, while M.P.
for Christchurch East, lie sailed into the
Defence Department for countenancing in-
sanitary conditions at Trentham Camp, and
dramatically ripped up_ mattresses with a
large knife in the presence of large num-
bers of Ministers' and ‘brass-hats. He got
the best of that argument. Later he became
Mayor of Christchurch. Quite independent
of a desultory medical practice, he makes a
point of speaking his mind, and can be re-
lied upon to create at, least seven scenes
a year In any assembly to which he gets
elected. He delivered his first electioneer-
ing address while consuming a large bag
of bananas, sandwiching praise of the
nutritious qualities of these between his refer-
ences to political matters. He is the most
influential supporter League football has in
M.L., and helped Dick Arnst to become a
world’s rowing champion. When standing
for office lie usually changes his second name,
Thomas, to Turakina or Tainui or something
like that.

Two Major Advantages
Studebaker Alone Offers
l—One-Trofit Value Construction
are only two manufac-
turers who actually build their
cars complete—make all their own
bodies, engines, clutches, steering
gears, differentials, springs, gear
boxes, axles, gray iron castings and
drop forgings.
One of these is Ford
—in the low-priced field.
The other is Studebaker
in the fine-car field.
Because we eliminate
the extra profits and
overhead that many
other manufacturers
have to pay to outside
parts and body makers
—we are able to use finer
materials and workman-
ship yet charge no
more than competing
cars.
As a natural outgrowth of
One-Profit manufacture
and Unit - Built Construc-
tion, a third great advan-
tage to the buyer is attain-
ed “No Yearly Models”.
Because all phases of man-
ufacture are directly under
Studebaker control. Stude-
baker cars are constantly
kept up-to-date. Improve-
ments are continually made
—not saved up for spectac-
ular announcements which
make cars artificially obso-
lete. Resale values are
thus stabilized.
But there is another
side to One-Profit manufacture —
a feature that no careful buyer can
afford to overlook.
Under this One-Profit policy the
entire car is designed, engineered and
manufactured as a complete, harmo-
nious unit in Studebaker plants.
Being Unit-Built it functions as a
unit. And this adds years to its life
—gives you scores of thousands of
miles of excess transportation —
greater riding comfort —minimum
repair costs —and, fin-
ally, higher resale value.
Examine the Standard
Six Coach closely —
make detailed compari-
son with other cars
and you will understand
the full meaning of
One-Profit value.
The Standard Six
Coach is the most pow-
erful closed car in the
world of its size and
weight. It is equipped
with full-size balloon
tyres, for which steer-
ing gear is specially de»
signed to insure greater ease of
handling. Its equipment includes an
8-day clock, and petrol gauge; auto-
matic windscreen cleaner, rear vi-
sion mirror; light control on steering
wheel, and other attractive features.

Hungry as a Bear
and Can’t Eat
A great many people get angry when you tell them they’ve got dyspepsia, but ’way down
deep in their stomachs they know they’ve got it. “I’d love to eat it, but I can’t,” is one
kind of dyspepsia. “I hate to think of it” is another kind. There are thousands of people
to-day who hate their meals and love them at the same time. They haven’t that fine, empty-
hungry, eat-everything-in-sight kind of feeling which goes with every good, healthy stomach.
And then there are others whose mouths don’t water at mealtime or at any other
time. They sit at the table and go through the motions only because it’s time to eat.
These people, too, are dyspeptics. Poor appetite, loss of strength, nervousness, headache,
offensive breath, heartburn, indigestion and dyspepsia are among the results of a disordered
stomach.
Every possible kind of stomach-trouble can be remedied by taking something which
digests what ycu cat and will just take right hold of all the food in your stomach and
digest it alone, without the help of the stomach, and let the stomach take a rest. DR.
SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES do this very thing. They are composed of the best
digestives known to science, and are absolutely safe. They do exactly the work that a good,
strong healthy stomach does. Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules relieve all cases of dyspepsia,
indigestion burning or irritation, loss of appetite, bloat, brash, belching, aversion to food,
fermentation and gas in the stomach. Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules will make you
feel “good” before and after each meal, and make your stomach strong and healthy again.

The Tryst in the Tea-tree.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rHEY say, the old women heside the
grey sea,
With their red-bordered eyelids a-
l linking at me:
“Poor Reuben is dead; and the sea takes its
toll!
Poor Reuben is drowned —the good God rest
his soul!”
I went where the aisles of the tea-tree were
black
With the withered old stems that were
long past their blooming.
In the night that was torn with the spume
and the rack
And the sound of the surf on the beacncs
long-booming.
With the wind in my hair and the ram on
my back,
I hurried me there where the shadows
were glooming.
“I’ll come,” he had said, “so be waiting for
me
When the moon is a-top of the farthest lone
tree!”
Blood-red was the sky when boats sailed
away,
With the tide o’er the weedy rocks hungrily
flowing;
His blue-bitten eyes were all frosted with
spray,
And the ends of his kerchief a-merrily
blowing.
Oh, how should he tell what would come with
the day?
Oh, how should he know what the old sea
was knowing?
And now let him come from the depths of
the sea,
And keep to his tryst in the tea-tree with
me!
I heard the wind trumpeting sudden and
shrill,
I hear the spent wavelets break out into
sobbing;
I saw the blown branches exultantly fill.
And the tattered leaves bob as the brown
boats were bobbing.
I waited there urging my heart to be still.
To cease from its leaping, to cease from
its throbbing—
“Oh, come you, come back from the cold
prison-sea,
My handsome young fisher, my Reuben, to
me!”
I saw the moon rise past the tree wan and
white,
And the surf died away from its clamorous
thunder;
And every black thing that was part of the
night,
Strained breathlessly there in a passion of
wonder.
I saw one come onward from dark into light,
Along by the twisted old tea-tree and
under—
-0 God, what was this that came straight-
way to me?
What thing was this drawn from the depths
of the sea?
Weed-shrouded he stood in an awful disguise.
Pale shells in his sodden hair broken and
tangled,
Torn fragments of fishing-net hanging slant-
wise,
With blossoms of slimy sea-fruit all be-
spangled.
There were crabs that did crawl in the holes
of his eyes,
And dripping kelp-ribbons from bare arms
that dangled—
’Twas Reuben, ’twas Reuben come back from
the sea
To keep his dead tryst in the tea-tree with
me!
“Oh, why did you bring me back here from
the deep,
Away from the of my pearly sea-
pillow ;
My slumber was tuned to the slow, current’s
sweep
Beneath the pale limbs of a weeping sea-
willow ;
And now I am doomed never more to find
sleep
Down, down in the tomb of the soft-
swelling billowy!”
I heard in his voice alii the grief of the sea
As he stood with his (Gripping arms held out
to me!
And the old women say as they stoop o'er
the shore
“Poor Reuben is dead, and she’ll see him no
more!”
But this have I got—like a ghost-thing with
me —
The kiss of the dead that lie under the sea!
VICTORIA.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EVER since she had switched off the
light in her new, -nforkmanlike con-
sulting-room and run down the path
to the gate she had had a feeling of impend-
ing crisis. She had stood for a ' moment
under the red lamp, looking 1 |it the light it
threw on her black velvet dioak with its
gleam of satin lining, and she had found
a certain comfort —almost tranquillity—in
the beauty of the colors. in her little
car, bumping out of town to the homestead
where the dance was to i>e held she began
to feel uneasy again. It was, of course, her
first appearance in social life since her re-
turn, laden with University honors, to her
home-town. She would be eyed and criti-
cised ; but; after all, they were mostly people
she had known in her childhood and her
’teens —it would be kindly criticism, surely.
Norman would be there. Had he forgotten
her in these years she had been away?
Letters, always few and far between, had
ceased altogether more than a year ago.
They had never been more tlian the casual
letters of friends. And yet, in those very
tar-off days before she had gone down to
Sydney there had been something—an en-
chantment in the air which made them look
at each other with promises in their eyes
which their lips were too youthfully shy
to confirm. And everyone had teased them
about each other.
Seven years. She had packed them very
full. Learning and experience, and the dis-
illusionment that follows when Youth finds
that things are not as they should be. Then
a slow, painful building-up of a faith in
the essential goodness of things as they are;
a faith which, receiving many hard knocks,
lay down to die more than once, and was
restored only by courage and conflict. She
wondered what Norman had done with his
seven years.
The car knocked, slackened and struggled
on an up-grade imperceptible at night. She
swore at her high-heeled satin shoes as she
felt for the clutch.
* * * *
She was surrounded by faces familiar, yet
strangely different from her recollection of
them. The years were a wall between her
and them. There was Johnny Drew with
a moustache and an air of boredom. !Ie
had been skulking about in his first pair of
long trousers when she went away. And
surely that languid youth philandering with
the flapper was Don Graliame, whom she
remembered as a gimbby and truculent 11-
year-old? And—yes—the flapper was
Peggy, little Peggy who had heroine-wor-
shipped her at school. She turned restlessly
to the older people, who did not show such
startling changes. Her heart was saying
fearfully that Norman would be different,
too —so different! Where was he? Why
didn’t he come?
She felt a hand on her arm, and turned.
“Remember me, Valerie?”
“Why, Kitty!”
“You’re a celebrity now —I suppose I
ought to call you Dr. Spencer, as I was
only a kid when you went away?”
“Please don’t! I’ve just been thinking
how everyone has changed, and feeling
rather lonely. You’ve grown up, but you
aren’t changed much.” She smiled appre-
ciatively at the wide blue eyes and curly
brown hair.
Kitty laughed; the confident laugh ot
twenty-one.
“Well, I ought to be! r< l’m an old married
woman —had you heard?”
“No! Who did you marry, Kit?”
Kitty, looking past Valerie’s shoulder,
beckoned.
“Here he is. I expect you’ll remember
him, too.” „ ~ .
Valerie turned. Her face was suddenly
a white mask. She held out her hand,
smiling.
“Why, yes!” she said. How are you,
Norman?”
* * *
Valerie worked. Not at her profession
only, for the doctor can work only as much
as the public likes. But she gardened,
and she sewed, and she read portly medical
books and sandwiched slender French novels
between them.
She had been, as professional etiquette
demanded, to call on old Dr. McNab, her
only colleague in the town. He had looked
at her from blue eyes almost lost beneath
overhanging Avhite eyebrows. He had said:
“I’m an old-fashioned man, Doetorr Spen-
cerr. Ye should marry and liae bairns.
But as ye are here, I hope we shall worruk
togetherr.”
She liked him at once. But it was not
till Jamie died that they became real friends.
Jamie was a shaggy, unlovely terrier Who
reserved every bit of his heart for his
master. He sat on the front seat when
McNab’s grey car went on its daily rounds,
and barked like a fury if anyone came within
half a dozen yards of it while the doctor
was in a house visiting a patient.
It was one morning when he called for
Valerie, who was to give an anaesthetic for
him, that the front seat beside the doctor
was empty. And the doctor was gruffer
than ever. Valerie said apprehensively:
“Jamie?”
Dr. McNab started the car and drove
half a mile before he answered. “The wee
dog is dead,”' lie told her, and no more was
said until, their work finished, they came
out to the car again on the top of one
of the hills that surrounded the town.
Valerie looked at him, and her own sense
of loss and loneliness called to his. The
passionate intensity of her sympathy forced
tears into her eyes as she touched his arm.
“I’m so awfully sorry,” she stammered,
“about Jamie.”
He looked at her sharply, and then as
sharply looked away at the town spread out
below them in the morning sunlight. “I
buried Jamie,” he said, “wi’ more grief than
I would ha’ buried half Kawarra.”
Six months of comparative peace, and
then, subtly and almost imperceptibly, came
unrest and tension; her loneliness was a
stabbing pain instead of a dull ache; she
was full of agonising desires which her
training made her recognise only too clearly.
She did not attempt to stamp them back
in a blind panic, as many women would have
done, but every night she deliberately faced
a fresh batch and routed it with a very
feminine mixture of logic and heart.
For Norman had come back into her
scheme of things. Not that she had been
seeing him more than usual; casual meetings
in the town or at the houses of mutual
friends formed the total of their intimacy.
But the long-ago magic had begun to work
spells on them again, and each knew that
the other felt it. She did not know, even
now, what he had done with his seven years.
Not in a material sense, of course; it was
common knowledge that he had worked his
timber-mill to such good purpose that he
was a wealthy man at twenty-nine. But she
wondered very often what there was behind
his eyes. What intellect? What theories on

"Every Picture
Tells a S iory ”
Have you suspected
your Kidneys?
Are you dragging along day in and day out with a dull,
throbbing backache ?
Do you feel lame in the morning, tired all day; suffer sharp,
torturing twinges at every sudden move? Then there s something
wrong!
You may never have suspected your kidneys, yet often its
the kidneys that are at fault. A cold, strain, o’r overwork congests
the kidneys and slows them up; poisons accumulate in the system,
and many mysterious aches and pains result.
You may have headaches and dizzy spells, too, with perhaps
some annoying bladder irregularity. Don t wait for more serious
trouble. Use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They have helped
many Sydney folks. They should help you.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Mr. A. B. Cowell, who lives at the corner of Park Road
and Hardy Street, Mascot, Sydney, says-“ Some months ago i
was suddenly seized with a terrible pain across my back, just
above the kidneys. It did not go away, as I thought at hrst at
would but, on the contrary, it got worse, and I was soon so oaa
that I was bent almost double. I was completely crippled and
even at night I got very little rest from the constant pain, i
could not turn over without suffering acutely, in fact, no
position was comfortable for long. My secretions were affected,
being thick and cloudy, with a red sediment. I tried different
remedies, but they gave me no relief whatever. One day a
friend suggested I should take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
and it proved to be good advice, too, for three bottles cured me
completely. I feel splendid now. and my recovery is due solely
to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Four years later Mrs. Cowell says: —“My son. is still well,
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills having completely banished all
signs of kidney trouble.”
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by all chemists and stores
at 2/9 per bottle, or from Foster-McClellan Co.,
15 Hamilton Street, Sydney.

SYDNEY PEOPLE TESTIFY.
A WOMAN’S WORD.
Mrs. W. Membrey, Como, 79 Sim-
mons Street, Fnmore, says : —“Fox-
three years I was a martyr to Piles,
and I don’t think any ailment causes
more suffering and loss of sleep. I
used Pile remedies, and was treated
by a doctor, but nothing gave me any
relief. After so many failures I
thought there was no cure for this dis-
tressing complaint, but I was mis-
taken, as a treatment with Doan’s
Ointment proved. A short course of
this wonderful preparation cured me,
and I advise sufferers to give it a
trial.”
Eleven years later Mrs. Membrey
says:—“Doan’s Ointment cured me of
Piles oV-er eleven years ago, and I
have been free of the complaint ever
since.”
A MAN'S WORD.
Mr. A. H. Francis, 192 Union Street,
Erskineville, Sydney, saysl uf ed
Doan’s Ointment for Itching and Fro

life? What creed? She had her oppor-
tunity one day to find out. Her car overtook
him on the road a mile or so from ins home.
She slowed down, and leaned out.
“Want a lift, Norman?"
“Thanks.”
He climbed in beside her. She noticed
that he was flushed, and his nervousness
was infectious. She almost wished that she
had driven on without speaking to. him, but
that would have seemed like running away.
She trod on the accelerator with unnecessary
violence, and the car, snapping itself out
of a rut, sent them both bouncing off the
seat, to which they returned breathless but
laughing.
“Sorry!” said Valerie. “That must, have
very nearly broken a spring.”
And simultaneously, almost as if the
words had been jolted out of him, lie asked
abruptly: “Are you really happy here?”
“Oh, very!” she lied. Dr. McNab is such
a good sort to work with, you know.”
“I thought you’d have married,” he said
bluntly. Then, with something that was
almost resentment in his eyes, lie burst out:
“And why didn’t you?”
She felt herself flushing, and spoke coldly,
“What do you mean?”
He looked hard at her, but she was intent
on the potholes.
"I’m sorry,” he said. “1 think you know
what I mean. I wouldn’t talk like this to
any other woman on earth, but with you it
doesn’t seem necessary to hide behind con-
ventions.”
She was very white, but quite calm, and
her scientific, brain was marvelling at the
confidence with which emotion . calls to
emotion with never a fear of not being under-
stood. For, after all, what had there been
between them? Nothing in the world but
looks, and smiles —and witchcraft.
“I can’t talk and drive over this road at
the same time,” she said, and steered to
the side of the road. She pulled off her
gloves and smoothed them on her lap.
“Conventions aren’t bad things, Norman,”
she said slowly. “Still, if you want to dis-
pense with them you may. But I think the
less we say to each other the better.”
“There’s this to be said, anyhow.” He
leaned forward, and his eyes looked excited,
almost feverish. “I love you, and you love
me. Isn’t that so?”
“That is so,” said Valerie steadily.^
“Why did you stay away so long?”
“I was learning a profession.”
“Valerie!”
He moved nearer and put out his hand to
touch her arm. Her quiet, serious face, the
suffering, the understanding, the knowledge
in her eyes stopped him. He had heard
much of the “equality” of men and women,
but until nqw he had never felt it. This girl
was not afraid of what she saw in his face:
she was not shocked ; she was not even shy.
She spoke at last, looking straight in front
of her, along the road.
“There isn't a thing to be done, Norman.
I’m glad you told me, although—somehow —
I knew. But your wife’s too good to suffer,
and so is my profession. Let’s go on.”
From a cottage a hundred yards behind
their stopping place old Miss Burns stared
after a vanishing car. “Siftin’ by the road-
side an’ talkin’ very friendly,” she mused.
She screeched out suddenly to her sister-in -
law: “Say, Mary, didn’t Norman Bolton
used to be mad on Dr. Spencer before she
went away?”
* * * w
There came a night some three months
later when wind tore over the town, bang-
ing doors and rattling windows; when rain
fell in a savage torrent that had something
relentless and terrifying about it; when
Valerie sat in the revolving chair at her
desk and cried, with her head on her out-
stretched arms. Never before had she vio-
lated the sacredness of her consulting-room.
Her bed was the proper place for tears;
her deep armchair in the dining-room was
the scene of her broodings over her private
unhappinesses.
But to-night sheer physical weariness had
beaten her. Dr. McNab was ill, and she had
been out all day seeing his patients as well
as her own. There had been one family who
lived five miles out of town, down a track
where the car could not go. She had left
it on the road and walked the impossible
half-mile to the house, fighting the wdnd
every inch of the way, stumbling on the
rough track, gasping with the weight of her
bag.
And to-night, while she sat there making
up her books for the day, the tears had come
suddenly and irresistibly. She listened to
the storm outside. “No one will come to-
night,” she thought, and gave way to the
flood, for she understood the value of tears
to an over-strained mind.
The bell of the telephone at her elbow
cut through her grief. She put the receiver
to her ear.
“Valerie!” The voice seemed to come from
the heart of the storm —to be the voice of
that frantic demon, the wind outside. “Val-
erie ! Hullo! is that Dr. Spencer?”
She gave a little gasping laugh, and was
horrified at herself as she recognised its note
of hysteria.
“Yes! Yes, Norman, it’s Valerie speak-
ing.”
Oh, to feel his arms round her once —
just once! Surely no one was meant to
suffer such loneliness? What was he going
to ask of her, this wild, unreal, dream-night?
Anything—anything.. ..
“Can ,you come? Kitty’s ill—she's pretty
bad —can you come at once?”
Some corner of her mind thanked Heaven
when she heard her own voice, clear and
decisive.
“I’ll come at once, Norman. Open the
gates so that I can get a run up the hill.”
She took her bag and went out into the
hall. As she shrugged herself into her mac-
intosh she called to her servant where she
was going. She splashed across the path to
the garage. Even to Norman, sick with
shame, remorse and anxiety, it seemed only
a short time before the headlights shone out
at the foot of the hill.
It was his turn now to feel that the night
was not real. What made it even more gro-
tesque was that a quotation—a relic of
Shakspeare laboriously learned at school -
kept hammering on liis brain as he listened
to the tempest outside: —
lt is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
But to Valerie the whole thing was actual
and vivid. The white searchlight of her
profession made every person and every in-
significant detail stand out with perfect
clarity. There was Kitty—yes, very bad-
pulse 140; temperature 104; respiration o<>.
Valerie went over to Norman.
“How long has she been sick?’’
“Since Tuesday—nearly four days.”
She snapped out sharply: “Why on earth
didn’t you send before?”
The helpless misery and embarrassment in
Norman’s eyes were sufficient answer, but he
explained lamely: “I- —I rang for Dr.
McNab, but lie’s ill himself, and—and she
didn’t seem really very bad till to-night....
And then, suddenly and beseechingly:
“What in it, Valerie?”
“Pneumonia. Go and get Nurse Brown.’
Kitty looked oddly, pathetically young.
Tin* flushed face and brilliant eyes, the soft,
curly hair, might have belonged to a child ot
twelve. She was conscious, but rather light-
headed. 'Phe wind worried her. As each
fresh blast yelled down the chimney and
through the crevices of the house, she turned
her head restlessly, and her eyes grew wider
and vaguely apprehensive.
Midnight came. Norman sat on a chair
near the door, stiffly upright, watching the
two women as they worked. His brain felt
heavy and confused. The round, plain face
of the nurse; Valerie's calm, dark eyes;
Kitty’s feverish beauty—-these things wheeled
through it making a rush ol light across
blackness, like the track of a rocket, borne-
times Kitty’s face and Valerie’s seemed to
merge into each other, so that he was hardly
sure which was which. But in that terrible
moment when Valerie came to tell him to go
to her, he understood clearly that his wue
was going to die.
She was still half-conscious. She tried to
cling to Norman as lie put his arms. round
her. She turned her face against his coat
and moaned. The crash of the wind and
the rain seemed to beat the tragedy of it
into Valerie’s heart. For now that the doc-
tor had fought and lost the woman could
-It’s so windy!” wailed Kitty suddenly.
“I don’t want to go out into the wind!”
* * * *
It was not until three weeks later that
the first poisonous breath of the rumor came
to Valerie’s ears. They had been hard and
bitter weeks for her, and in her thirst . for
work to fill the long hours she had noticed
that comparatively few people had come to
consult her. But with many of her own
private demons to fight she had dismissed
the fact from her mind as being due to
one of those inevitable “slack times” which
every doctor knows and expects.
She knew that Norman’s love for her
was gone, as finally and irrevocably as a
soap-bubble is gone when it bursts, i here
was some queer, instinctive sympathy be-
tween them which had made words super-
fluous for the declaration of their love. That
same understanding told her now that for
some obscure psychological reason Norman
could not love the woman who had battled
to save his wife. With a shrug for the
irony of things she realised, that if Kitty
had' lived Norman’s passion for herself
would have continued. “It's just whoever
happens to be out of reach, she told her-
self wearily.
And then Charlotte had come blundering
in. her arms still damp from scrubbing the
kitchen, her red face a round mask ot
horrified distress and indignation, Charlotte
was not tactful. Valejrie received the full
force of Kawarra’s malice beneath the jaw,
so to speak.
“ an’ it’s that Miss Burns, doctor, the
dirty, lyin' old spiteful devil, said she’d seen
youa-earryin’ on with Mr. Bolton in the car,
and of course”
“Go on,” said Valerie.
“Well —well” —— Charlotte was anxiously
apologetic. “It always ’as been said in the
town as ’ow you two was—kind o’ keen on
each other. . But, Lord love us, can’t a per-
son change their feelin’s?"
“And the general opinion in the town,”
Valerie said evenly, “is that I did not try to
save Mrs. Bolton because I wanted to marry
her husband?” t
Charlotte was awed by ; her calm, She
burst noisily into tears and shuffled out of
the room.
Valerie sat still and thought.
It became very obvious, as the weeks went
by, that the slander had dofle its work. Only
a few patients came to V alerie’s consulting-
room, and even these looked at her with that
expression of personal interest which de-
stroys the balance of confidence between
doctor and patient.
Over and over again her raw, wincing
sensibilities said : “Run away! Run away !”
And over and over again her pride aud de-
termination said “Live "it down.” But she
began to see that all the determination in
the world would not make a practice. She
must live, and apparently Kawarra had no
intention of supplying her with the means.
Her home-town was driving her out.
When at last, after weeks of negotiation
and haggling over prices, she had bought
another little practice, some three hundred
miles from Kawarra, she went to say her
one and only farewell —to Dr. McNab.
“Ye’ve had but a puir go here,” be said
wrathfully. “I hae reasoned wi’ some, an’
I hae argued wi’ some, an’ others I hae
cursed outright. But they’re gey obstinate
devils, and slander is the breath o’ their
nostrils. An’ it’s a breath” —he added medi-
tatively—“that uproots a practice just as
yon great wind uprooted that tree in my
garden.”
She smiled.
“I’m going to be a practical demonstra-
tion of my own pet theory,” she said. “A
woman can’t start off scratch with the men.
Her sex hangs round her neck like a mill-
stone. But it’s my idea that even with such
a handicap we can make a dead-heat of
it.”
As she walked down the path to the gate
the eternal masculine soliloquised, shaking
its white head. “She should marry, an’
hae bairns,” it said.
