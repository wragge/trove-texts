HIS
BOOKS
The Literary Sportsman
It is significant that “The Coinpleat
Angler” has been through more editions than
any other book in the world, with the excep-
tion of the Bible. Other nations may beat
the British at sports which the British in-
vented or popularised, but they can’t ap-
proach them as writers about sport. All the
best sporting verse from Calverley to Duncan
Fife and all the best comic passages from
Dickens to W odehouse have been written
by Englishmen or Scots, and every front
rank prose-writer of to-day on golf, horse
andhunting, fishing and shooting (big-gam
and otherwise) and, of course, cricket, i
an Englishman, an Irishman or a Scot
Proficiency and early association don’
seem to have much to do with it; na Eng
lishman has written about cricket so fascin
atingly as Barrie and Andrew Lang, wh
were born and bred north of the Tweec.
The likeliest explanation is that the Briton
has more of the amateur spirit than th
sportsman of other countries; not that he i
less ready to make money out of a game i
the chance offers, but that he gets mor
fun and interest out of games irrespectiv
of the financial aspect. Sport inspires a kinc
of ecstasy in the Briton, whether amateur
shamateur or pro., and he can often pm
his emotions into words. That is why an
article about, golf by, say, Bernard Darwin
is more enjoyable even to golfers than one
by Bobby Jones. The American champion
explains how the game should be played
the English rabbit shows how it may be
enjoyed.
King of Golf Writers
Out of the Rough (Chapman and Hall
6s.) is Mr. Darwin’s latest. The subjec
of his first chapter is Gene Sarazen (“one
of the finest hitters of a goif ball that eve
lived, and also one worthy of the name of
good golfer, than which no man can look
forward to a better epitaph”), and there is
an interesting note on Francis Ouimet, whore
Darwin was astounded to see beat Ray anc
Vardon in the U.S.A. in 1913; “in a sense
it founded the American Golfing Empire.’
But for the most part he just gossips abouu
the delights of the game—gives a descrip-
tion of a Sunday afternoon on a remark-
able little private links in Scotland; re-
veals the “traditional rite” which follows
the annual match between Cambridge, Past
and Present, at Worlington; recalls games
of his youth; discusses books which dis-
cuss golf as it was a hundred years ago—
and he does it with a lyric zest which is
highly contagious. The bom proselytiser.
Few sportsmen can have made so many
converts to their game.
A Scottish Angler
A good many Australians know, or know
of, Henry Lamond, author of Days and
Ways of a Scottish Angler (Philip Allan;
12s. 6d.), as the conservator of Loch Lomond.
A few may have read his verses and his
classic work on sea trout. But, speaking gen-
erally, his interests, sporting and otherwise
are not ours. There are some men who
never grow old- they remain primarily
cricketers, polo-players, ex-public school
boys, as the case may be, all their lives.
Mr. Lamond is of their number in a sense;
his new book is the autobiography of a
man to whom angling is one of the most
important things in life. Some reasons why
it might be argued that the average Aus-
tralian is not likely to be interested in it
are that a good deal of it is about loch
fishing, and we have no lochs; many chap-
ters deal with salmon and sea-trout fishing,
and neither fish can be brought to
maturity here (salmon have been put down
•in Australia several times, but they never
came back after their first visit to the
sea); and other parts discuss the eti-
quette and the legal side of angling in the
United Kingdom, and other subjects which
have little bearing on conditions in this
part of the world. Yet Mr. Lamond’s pub-
lishers knew what they were doing when
they sent his work to Australia. It has
a compelling interest and charm: as a
revelation of the writer’s pleasant nature,
for its pictures of life among all classes in
rural Scotland, and for its simple, nervous
prose. Like Mr. Darwin, Mr. Lamond is
a literal man who is only a sporting
writer by chance. Two or three of
his chapters, such as the one on flies,
may be helpful to anglers on streams in
the Commonwealth. In wet-fly fishing he
believes that anything that looks like a
smalf fly is good enough: “I agree with
Stewart that a general impression of a fly,
either in the
nymph state or as
the perfect imago,
will be as success-
ful as the most
exact of imita-
tions.”
Buying a Horse
Australians are not the horsey people
they were as recently as a couple of genera-
tions ago. The Waler, world-famed at
the beginning of the century, is becoming a
memory. Hunting is languishing in Vic-
toria and S. Australia and it is years since
N. S. Wales supported so much as a
drag pack. The general-utility horse is
seen in ever-decreasing numbers up country,
and it has almost vanished from the cities.
If it were not for the great shows in which
the prizes for champion hunters and hacks
are regularly won by animals that have not
been hunted or hacked, and are never likely
to be, most inhabitants of the Common-
wealth would be in danger of forgetting
what a horse of the remount type looks
like. The Same with hackneys. It is not
too much to say that racehorses and racing
ponies are the only equine classes in which
young Australia takes any real interest, and
they are only “followed,” as the saying goes,
as gambling instruments. The frequent
appearance in England of books on the
lines of Lieut.-Colonel Goldscmidt’s An
Eye for a Horse (Constable; 10s.) shows
how different matters are there: In spite
of the activities of opponents of “blood
sports,” practically all the historic packs of
foxhounds and staghounds are as flourish-
ing as in pre-war days; the two great
coaching clubs keep up their memberships;
there are four-in-hand and tandem classes
at the important horse shows, and the de-
mand for polo ponies, children’s ponies and
hacks is brisk. Sir John Moore (Director
of Veterinary Services in France through-
out the war) told a London “Daily Ex-
press” interviewer recently that many
English business firms had gone back to
horses; “two railway companies have 2000
horses each, and they are not giving them
up. They can’t afford to.” So books like
that of Lieut.-Colonel Goldscmidt remain
in strong demand. Stronger than ever, per-
haps, since, in an age of mechanisation,
buyers get fewer opportunities to learn
about horses from personal experience than
their forebears did, and so tend to rely
more on the written advice of recognised
authorities. An Eye for a Horse is chiefly
concerned with the good and bad points of
thoroughbreds, saddle horses (hacks and
hunters), and hackneys. Several of the
plates that have figured in former works
about British horses (the Darley Arabian,
the Byerley Turk, Eclipse and the Godol-
phin Barb) reappear in this book, and there
are some interesting photographs of the
spines of Ayrshire, St. Frusquin and Isin-
glass. They show that all these famous
gallopers suffered from curvature. They
were raced as two-year-olds, whereas Eclipse,
whose flawless spine is also shown, never
had a saddle on him till he was a four-year-
old. The chapter headed “The Cold Ride”
contains nearly all the wisdom necessary to
one who is thinking of buying a hunter or
polo pony from a stranger after a short
trial. Its two main points a.re that any
fault shown during a trial must be accepted
as permanent, and that no one should buy
a horse without testing him on a hard sur-
face. Not without reason do exhibitors
at the Dublin Show always try to confine
the tests of intending purchasers to the
grass rings. The ancient trade of horse-
coping has almost died out in this country
for the reasons already specified, but all
who have bought or sold horses should
derive pleasant memories, if nothing more,
from the sections on dealing. The sections
in which light and heavy draughts and race-
horses are discussed have a definite Aus-
tralian interest. In the main, however, this
is essentially a book for British and Ameri-
can sportsmen.
RED PAGE.
A Resentful Genius
Bertrand Russell, author of Education
and the Social Order (Allen and Unwin;
7s. 6d.), has one of the most luminous minds
of his generation, but it isn’t a judicial
mind, so he is a failure as a guide to life,
xiis thesis, that mankind is wicked and is
heading for ruin in consequence, is older
than the doctrine of original sin. Nation-
alism, he says, aided and abetted by
religion, is to blame, and civilisation can
only save itself by abolishing both. Teach
the young the criminal folly of armies
navies and customs barriers; do away with
martial songs, flags and similar incitements
to patriotism,, and disseminate agnosticism
and human nature will change. Injustice’

...A MESSAGE TO MARRIED MEN
OR MEN ABOUT TO BE MARRIED ...
ASK her what kind of a man she
wants for a husband. Ask her
whether she prefers a man with a weak,
flabby, ill-shaped body to a man with
a body as strong, sturdy and handsome
as a Greek god’s. Oh, she may love
you well enough now' —but do you
know that there are all degrees of love?
And if you’re wise, you’ll set out to
be the man she once dreamed of (and
still does). Then married life will be
so much happier—so much more worth
while —with much less quarrelling and
differences.
PLEASURES BEYOND YOUR FONDEST DREAMS!
YOU can do it—easily, too. You can
experience the pleasures of living
that are beyond your fondest dreams.
The thrill of such living as you never
knew' is now awaiting you.
A FEW MINUTES A DAY AND YOU HAVE THEM
I ’EE take that body of yours and build
it into something so wonderful, so
impressive, so altogether beyond your
fondest hopes, that you’ll gasp with
amazement when you look into the
mirror at the end of the first 30 days.
I’ll take those skinny, soft arms of
yours and transform them almost over-
night into lithe, steel-like battering
rams of marvellous speed and power.
I’ll take the kinks out of that weak
back —straighten it out—tighten it up
around the waist —go over the lungs,
the heart, the kidneys, the liver—
strengthening, always strengthening.
I’ll take that weak, flabby stomach
and make the muscles around it look
and feel like a cast-iron washboard.
I’ll straighten out those thin, stooped
shoulders —square them up—broaden
them—literally pack muscle on them
until they look like a piano-mover’s.
Earge lumps of red-blooded muscle will
magically appear here, there, everywhere
—and you’ll feel so full of pep and
vitality you’ll want to conquer the world.
IN THE FIRST 30 DAYS I
GUARANTEE
And it doesn’t take years to work this
transformation —nor even months. In
the first 30 days I guarantee to add
one full inch of real, live muscle to
each of your arms, and two full inches
of the same virile, health-bringing
strength across your chest. And it’s a
real guarantee. Thousands of men have
proved it to their satisfaction in the
last six months.

covetousness, jealousy, and the rest of the
passions which necessitate not only defence
forces, but policemen, factory inspectors,
night watchmen, caretakers and innumerable
other officials of the kind, will vanish; also,
presumably, locks, bolts and bars. The
leonine nations will lie down with the
lamb-like ones in the virtuous fold of the
World State.
Russell is as judicial as Darwin himself
where his prejudices are not concerned.
The character of an adult plant or animal results
from the interaction of the organism from the
moment of fertilisation onwards. I have tried to
make this statement as colorless and uncontroversial
as possible, because everything more definite is matter
of controversy.
On the other hand, when he is trying to
score points against one of his phobias he
can talk like a Domain orator. He rarely
refers to religion by its name; “superstition”
is preferred. He is strong on generalisations.
Most people whose intelligence is much above the
average are nowadays openly or secretly agnostic.
Take any average class of a hundred boys; I
should guess that ninety of them learn only from
fear of punishment, nine from a competitive desire
for success, and one from love of knowledge.
To know how to teach is at present thought
desirable in those who teach the poor, but the
sons of “gentlemen” are still taught by wholly
untrained teachers.
Failing birth-rates, combined with militarism, are
giving to the State an increasing interest in the
welfare of children, since it is wasteful from the
governmental point of view for a male to die
before he is old enough to be killed on the battlefield.
Such untruths and half-truths bear no
relation to scientific thinking. They are
appeals to emotion.
Many of the deductions from facts are
equally unreliable. Russell, compares Dis-
raeli’s “The time will come when you shall
hear me” with Pitt’s “Sugar, sir” repeated
with ever-increasing solemnity three times
till the tittering House of Commons was sub-
dued. His point is that Disraeli had a
Jew’s dread of the herd mind, whereas Pitt
held it in aristocratic contempt. The his-
torical truth is that Disraeli was making
his maiden speech when he let himself be
laughed down, while the elder Pitt, in
addition to the portentous dignity which
often accompanies humorlessness, had the
advantage of being a seasoned Parliamen-
tarian when the House had the impudence
to be amused by his comic opening. The
time came when the Commons heard Dis-
raeli as meekly as it ever did Pitt.
One of the educational reforms advo-
cated is the segregation of exceptionally
clever children in special schools;, and it
is, in a sense, the keynote of the book.
Russell was evidently miserable at school,
as Napoleon, Byron, Shelley and other
brilliant boys were, and he is sure he would
not have been miserable at a different kind
of school in the same way as he is sure he
would be happy in a differently constituted
society. It is the basic fallacy of his whole
case. The young Napoleon, the young
Shelley, and others whom he mentions were
not unhappy because they were clever but
because they were social misfits. They
proved it by being unhappy in every social
milieu they entered during the whole of
their lives. D. H. Lawrence never went to
a public school, and during the second half
of his life he was able to choose his associ-
ates, yet, like the author of this book, he
never quite fitted in anywhere, and he grew
progressively more angry with the world.
To rage against the social order, to talk of
scrapping national patriotism on the chance
that other nations may follow suit, and to
advocate the extermination of religion are
futile activities, as history, during the past
5000 years, has proved. Obviously the world
would be pleasanter if controls could be
done away with safely; if the Byrons,
Shelleys and Russells could be accommo-
dated with schools, universities and social
circles suited to their temperaments, and
if everybody else could be catered for in
the same way; but before there is a hope
of world peace arriving on such lines the
capacity for indignation will have to be
eliminated from the human heart, and this
book proves that an eminent pacifist is
liable to have as big a share of it as the
next man.
J.B.D.
Parnassus and the Depression
The new slump in war books appears to
me to have psychological origin. During the
years subsequent to Armageddon publishers
and editors said that the public was sick of
the war and didn’t want to know about it,
until the staggering success of “All Quiet”
showed how little they understood the
material they were handling. What had
actually happened was that the public
didn’t want to know about the war as inter-
preted by official and unofficial propagan-
dists—the Mars beautifiers. After “All
Quiet” the rage for war books was un-
limited, and any work, however bad, was
acceptable so long as it drew, with a suffi-
ciently unflinching hand, the miseries and
sufferings and spiritual torments inflicted
alike on combatants and civilians by this
grisly Moloch. Then there was a sudden
slump. The public didn’t want any more
war books, was the cry at all libraries.
Now once more we are told people are tired
of the war. The truth is they are begin-
ning to see it in a different perspective.
In the midst of the prosperity which con-
tinued after the Armistice it was comforting
to think that during the war we had all been
suffering martyrdom and were now being re-
warded for it. Now that we have suffered
three years of the great depression every-
thing looks different. All the economists can
tell us is that ultimate recovery will come as
a result of further suffering. So there is a
lack of interest in war books which tell of
the suffering in the war years. In fact, many
are beginning to wonder if a lot of people
suffered as much as has been asserted, or
as compared with the way people are
suffering at present.
But any librarian will tell you that, if
there is no interest in war books, there is
an immense interest in books about Russia.
An interesting feature about these is that,
whereas those written by Communists have
been growing more critical of the Soviet
experiment, those written by foreigners, even
from capitalistic America, have been growing
more respectful and even envious.
PAWANG.
A Satchel of Books
Ottwell Binns’s new book. Trader Random
(Ward Lock; 7s. 6d.), is about life in the
Islands thirty years ago. Ross Random
has hardly won the love of Maime, the only
girl in the world for him, when the villainous
Lord Watcombe, owner of the steam yacht
Flamingo, intervenes. This remarkable peer
is in league with the lowest of tlie low, and
wants to marry Maime himself. Needless
to say, he is foiled, and Ross turns out to
be the rightful heir. A fast-moving yarn
on the lines of &,n old-time melodrama.
When we first meet Chame Maxwell of
Frank C. Robertson’s Shoot Up (Wild West
Club; 7s. 6d.), a range war is on. Chame
rescues young Jack Hunter, and so meets
the Girl. A “smooth oval face framed in
a mass of disordered dark hair” (she is in
her nightie at the time), “wide, clear grey
eyes fringed with long dark lashes”—you
know the type. Red Kelly is the chief villain
(“low and bestial” is one of the author’s
phrases for him), but he is only one among
many. “Chame, dear, I’ve always wanted
to live here” is the concluding remark and
we leave you, in absolute confidence of the
result, to guess who made it.
John Quaintance, by Mary Wiltshire
(Sampson Low: Robertson and Mullens;
7s. 6d.). It begins with John’s marriage to
Margery Hillier. He was an undistinguished
country architect and Scoutmaster at the
time. A failure. How different from his
brilliant brother Graham, who had done well
in the war and was now a rising doctor!
But it is Graham who proves to be the
failure. His affairs go to smash and John,
who has guaranteed him at the bank, loses
his all. The calamity is a blessing in dis-
guise so far as John is concerned. He and
Margery were drifting apart, and their com-
mon troubles bring them together again. A
sincere story of interesting people clearly
seen and effectively analysed.
And a Little Verse
FANTASY.
If I could don fay footwear for one night,
I should go gaily forth adventuring.
I’d scale the mountains, heedless of their
height,
And warm my hands beneath an eagle’s
wing.
Where caves yawned blackly in a hill’s
green face
I’d snatch a gold torch from the blossom-
ing broom,
And ’neath the earth I’d flit from place to
place,
My yellow taper rolling back the gloom.
Perhaps I’d find a miser goblin’s store
Hid in some secret cavern, where the walls
Are lichen-covered, and the rock-paved floor
Is clamorous with sound of one’s footfalls !
I would go down
White moon-washed shores where curdled
foam is tossed,
And turn the wet weed over, salt and brown,
In search of things the gale-lashed tides
had lost.
With elfin ease I’d climb a gaunt cliff s lips,
Trod only by the coral-footed gulls,
And hear the wind tell tales of treasure
ships
That lie with weed-grown decks and rot-
ting hulls.
Then ere the dawn spilled roses through the
bars
Of Heaven’s blue, and claimed my magic
shoon,
I’d gather diamonds from the ageless stars,
And gold-dust from the coffers of the
moon!
TASMANIA.
NORMA L. DAVIS.
IF PAN AWOKE.
In some dark wood sleeps Pan, the fallen
leaves
Of withered summers drifting over him ;
The golden Pan (so wine and gathered
sheaves
Are golden). Each brown limb
That danced through roses is composed and
still;
Pan is asleep, unhaurited mead and hill.
Yet if Pan woke some evening when the ripe
Rare nectarines are tasted by the moon.
And dancing maids who heard his eerie pipe
Danced a new measure to his antick tune;
And if some Nell or Kate who primly trips
With milking-stool and pail should
startled see
Him laughing from a thicket, wreathed red
lips , _ ,
Stained with cherries from the Parsons
tree;
At Parson rising from Sabbatic quiet,
Shook he (and laughing sped) his golden
curls,
Called to his leafy and his lyric not
The Parson’s laughing girls;
And all the ways they went, the merry flight,
Birds sang in rival to their noonday songs
And the sun’s flowers shone brighter at mid-
night
And men rose up forgetful of old wrongs.
If Pan awoke would all our country lasses
Be light-limbed, rosy-bosomed maenads,
And all our Bottoms undisguised asses,
And all our loutish lads be golden lads?

DOES MACHINERY CAUSE
UNEMPLOYMENT?
At the back of the minds of millions of
people there is an uneasy suspicion that it
does. They may not be ready to declare
off-hand that we should be better without
telephones and motor-cars and safety razors
and sewing machines and gas-stoves; never-
theless, when they see another piece of plant
introduced that will throw a hundred more
men out of work, they can come to no other
conclusion than that machinery is a cause,
if not the chief cause, of unemployment.
What they see quite clearly is that if all the
things that are done by machinery were
done by hand, there would not be an idle
person in the country—perhaps not an idle
person in the world. What they ought to
do, of course, is to go a step further and
find out how many of these things actually
would then be done. That would bring
them to the foundation of the whole
business.
What is this machinery about whose
advantages so many of us at one time or
another have doubts. If we propose to
discard it, how far back are we going? If
we throw out the electric sewing-machine
because it is capable of doing so much more
work than the old “hand” or “treadle,” why
not throw out the old “hand” or “treadle”
so that we may employ thousands more
seamstresses? Where ought we to stop on
the farm? We began real agriculture with
the sickle and have gone on to the header.
At what point between those two should
we have stopped? At what point between
the single-furrow plough and the cultivator?
A Melbourne trades-hall officer the other
day saw a scoop, a motor-truck and five men
doing an excavation job on which a few
years ago 70 navvies, he says, would have
been employed. Another discovered that
one man with a spray can do as much white-
washing as 40 men did with pots and
brushes. And the president of the A.L.P.
at Pt. Pirie declares that, though the smel-
ters there handle as much material as ever,
owing to the installation of labor-saving
devices only 1000 men are required in place
of the former 2500. All these assume that
things were just right at the earlier dates
they mention. But, as we know, men said
then just the same as some say now. It
wasn’t 20 or 30 years ago that Britain saw
its most serious anti-machinery riots. It
was a hundred years ago.
In a sense, no matter when they lived,
people were right, too, in saying that
machinery displaces men. Indeed, in almost
every case that is wha.t it is for. One man
can grow and harvest as much wheat as
three did only 50 years ago; and probably
one man could then grow and harvest as
much as three had done 50 years before
that. Now, since a given number of people
in the world do not consume six times more
wheat than they did a hundred years ago—
perhaps, taking them all round, they do not
consume any more, diet being now much
more varied—it is certain that an enormous
number of men who under old conditions
would have been farmers can find nothing to
do in that business. But since one man can
produce as much food as half a dozen for-
merly did—and one man can also produce
as much clothing as a dozen formerly did—
it follows that the others can be maintained
while they are doing something else. Six
men could grow 3000 bushels of wheat;
they could just make a living out . of it.
Machinery is introduced, and one man alone
can grow 3000 bushels. Formerly he had to
hire'five men to help him grow the wheat:
now, having the same harvest, he can hire
them to do other things. But, it will be
said, he doesn’t employ the extra labor.
Being now so much better off, he lives in a
better house and buys more ’and dearer
things. This, of course, is quite true. But
when he buys things he buys labor. Ninety-
five per cent, of the cost of his new house
is direct and indirect labor cost.
Much —perhaps most—of the world’s in-
dustrial trouble occurs because it does not
accommodate itself quickly enough to the
introduction of new appliances. This is most
true just at present. The mechanic and
the chemist were very busy a few years ago,
and the production of almost all primary
products per capita of those engaged in them
was enormously accelerated. That was a
time consequently when it was necessary for
men to be withdrawn from primary produc-
tion: the per capita production being in-
creased, those engaged in the industry could
afford to employ more people to do things
for them. But the war gave millions of
young men a taste for the open-air and the
seeming independence of a farmer’s or a
planter’s life; and Governments encouraged
young men to look that way. The result
was a vast over-production of wheat, rub-
ber, coffee and many other staples, followed
by a crash in prices. The purchasing
power of the individual primary producer
shrivelled; and soon there was trouble
throughout - secondary industry, reacting
further on the primary producers, reducing
both their market and their purchasing power
Still further.
If machinery is a curse because it dis-
places men, then we are wrong ever to work
a rich mine, because a poor mine will call
for more labor to produce a given result.
For the same reason we ought never to
work a good farm, because fertility will
have the same effect as new machinery—it
will enable us to produce much with com-
paratively little labor. In real life, of
course, such nonsense never occurs to us.
So we use a sharp axe instead of a blunt
one, not being so stupid as to think that
the longer we take to chop the wood and
the more fatigued we are in the process the
better off we are.
In the same way new machinery may
enable one to make a good living where
previously he almost starved. The Pt. Pirie
man implies that labor-saving appliances
have thrown 1500 men out of a job. On the
contrary they have enabled 1000 men at
Pirie and probably 3000 men at Broken Hill
and 1000 men elsewhere to keep jobs which
otherwise they would have lost; for if the
industry had still to carry 2500 men at Pt.
Pirie, it is quite certain that not a mine at
Broken Hill would be worked to-day.
So far from machinery being the cause of
unemployment it is, then, the greatest job-
maker in the world. It can speed up pro-
duction as nothing else can, and production
means purchasing power. If a man has a
machine that will enable him to make three
.pairs of boots ■ where previously; he made
only one, he can reduce the price of his
boots, enabling his buyers to spend money
on other goods, or he can himself buy three
times as much as he previously could—so
long as the market for boots is not over-
supplied. The chief domestic work of civili-
sation is to see that no industry does over-
produce—to see that the surplus supply of
iabor in, say, the boot industry is switched
over to minister to some of the bootmaker’s
new and fortunately interminable needs. It
is because the world has failed to preserve
this equilibrium that it has so many unem-
ployed. With the gradual recovery of equili-
brium the workers of the world will get back
to jobs. These depressions are nature’s way
of restoring the balance.
THE BOARD OF CONTROL.
Three Test matches have been won and
lost, and there are two to be played. But
if the “Test-match spirit,” as thus far
exemplified, is to continue; if the scenes
witnessed at Melbourne and Adelaide are
to be repeated; if the minds of the spec-
tators are to be inflamed by further out-
breaks of vulgar journalism, boastful and
jeering on the one side, squealing and
abusive on the other; if there are to be
mbre idiotic proceedings on the part of the
Board of Control—if these things are to
happen, then it would be better if the
remaining matches were abandoned.
It can by no means be said that the
entire English cricket world is in favor of
leg-theory bowling and the entire Australian
cricket world against it. Many Englishmen
—among them Jackson, F. R. Foster and
A, E. R. Gilligan—-condemn it as unfair/
and dangerous.. Many Australians approve
of it, holding that the bat has for years
been beating the ball and that the fast
bowler must adopt a new method or go
under. Certainly the dice have been loaded
against him, especially in Australia, with
its long, hot summers and its eight-ball
overs in club and inter-State matches. The
perfect wickets, covered at night; the prac-
tice of waiting for the loose ball; and the
annoyance of being jeered at by the crowd
because a stodgy batsman has refused to
play at a ball into which the bowler has
put his whole strength have sickened many
a young fellow of fast bowling or incapaci-
tated him for it. Brief was the stay in
first-class cricket of Everett, Nicholls,
Morton and Fox. Gilbert was out of action
for part of the present season, and Thurlow
is evidently finding the strain too great.
Jack GregOiy, the most interesting all-
rounder of this generation, played little
representative cricket after he was 31. Any-
one who has seen this splendid specimen
of Australian manhood bowling his heart
out, hour after hour, to dull batsmen who
let half his deliveries whizz by without
lifting the bat from the block-hole will
have a sneaking sympathy with the much-
abused Larwood.
Whatever happens to leg-theory' and Test-
match cricket something will have to be
done about the Bdard of Control, This
concern had a great name in the days of
W. P. McElhone and E. E. Bean, but it
has sadly degenerated since. It fined Brad-
man heavily for publishing a book when he
was on tour in England, but forgave Grim-
mett for the same offence. It forbade Brad-
man to write Test-match stuff for the news-
paper which finds part of his salary, but
permitted the young man and other mem-
bers of the Australian XI to broadcast it.
It turned up in Melbourne for a meeting
of no consequence a day before the second
match, and kept the team guessing until
the men were in their flannels who was to
be captain. At this meeting, though it alleg-
edly “defined its attitude on the player-
writer question,” the board said not a word
about leg-theory. It was equally silent
about leg-theory when WoodfulPs men won
the match. But when Woodfull’s men were
losing at Adelaide, the board sent, a hys-
terical protest to the M.C.C.:-
Body bowling has assumed such proportions as to
menace the best interests of the game, making pro-
tection of the body by the batsman the main con-
sideration, and causing intensely bitter feeling
between players, as well as injury. In our opinion
it is unsportsmanlike, and unless stopped at once
is likely to upset friendly relations existing between
Australia and England.
The authors of this unspeakable rubbish
transmitted it without reference to the
umpires or the English skipper. Yet it is
laid down in the rules that “the umpires
are the sole judges of fair and unfair play,”
and the English skipper is the board’s guest.
No more shocking breach of hospitality and
sportsmanship has been committed in the
name of Australian cricket; and what hurts
most is that Australians who have no use
for the board or its works may be mis-
taken for small-minded people who attach
exaggerated importance to cricket matches
and can’t win without skiting nor lose
without squealing. The board is the crea-
tion of the State cricket associations, and
those associations—which likewise were not
consulted—should dissociate themselves
from the ignominious cablegram. They
should also insist on radical changes in. the
board’s constitution and personnel, and
place it beyond the power of the reformed
body to expose Australians to ridicule.
MAORILAND’S EXCHANGE RATE.
Maoriland for months past has been seeth-
ing with controversy on the subject of
London exchange. About the middle of
last year A. C. Davidson, general manager
of the Bank of N.S.W., visited the
Dominion and strongly advocated depress-
ing the value of M.L. currency to the
Australian level as a means of “saving the
farmers,” an argument that was subse-
quently supported by Prof. D. B. Copland,
who revisited his native land to spread this
gospel. Most of the banks, apart from “the
Wales,” received the idea coldly, and Cham-
bers of Commerce damned it root and
branch; but the Farmers’ Union, the great-
est political power in the country, saw in it
something good for its members. Pressure
was brought to bear on the Government
and on the Bank of New Zealand. The
bank resisted. It said in effect that, while
juggling with the exchange rate might, for
a while, be profitable to the bank, it wasn’t
going to prove profitable to the country,
and, therefore, taking a long view, it wasn’t
good banking. The Government sat on the
rail as long as it could; but, gradually,
waverers in the Cabinet were won over,
until the only dissentient was Finance
Minister Downie Stewart—he is a lawyer,
and almost every other member of the
team is a farmer. Now the rate has been
bumped up from 10 p.c. to 25 p.c., the banks
obeying the Government under protest, and
Stewart has resigned.
Maoriland’s interest bill in London,
national and municipal, amounts to about
£7,000,000 a year at present. The higher
rate means an additional million annually
due to London—and for some time past
budgeting for deficits has been inescapable.
The trading situation is that, despite the
big slump in primary produce prices, 1932
ended with a statistical margin in M.L.’s
favor of about £13,000,000, which, even
allowing, for all sorts of “invisibles,” pro-
vided amply for the London interest bill.
The rise in exchange rate has therefore been
made in the face of a substantial surplus
of M.L. funds in London. Furthermore,
M.L. banknote currency, unlike Australian,
is backed by gold to the extent of just a
fraction short of 100 p.c. If there is anything
in the theory that a _ country can become
prosperous by selling its money abroad for
less than it is worth, Maoriland has the
stage set for a most conclusive demon-
stration.
ARE WE GROWING SUGAR IN THE
WRONG PLACES?
Really, the crooked streets of Sydney are
very silly. And they are not only crooked:
here George-street is a bottle-neck, there it
spreads out to a width so great that only
the sprightly will venture to cross it except
under conduct of a traffic officer. And look
at the spider’s-web of streets south of Syd-
ney Cove! Already millions have been
spent in straightening and widening these
avenues of traffic; but it would take scores
of millions to do what ought to be done.
We know, however, that it never will be
done—within this, century, at any rate. If
we had planned from the beginning, matters
would have been different; as it is, we know
we must just make the best of things. All
life is like that. If everybody had been as
wise yesterday as he thinks he is to-day, we
should be able to give all our Divorce Court
Judges a long holiday.
Now there are people telling us that we
made a great mistake over our sugar-
growing. We shouldn’t have planted cane
on the Northern Rivers of N. S. Wales;
indeed, we shouldn’t have planted any south
of Townsville. We are assured that away
up in the Far North there are tens of
thousands of acres of virgin land which
could by reason of soil and climate grow far
larger crops than most of the country which
is under cultivation in the south; and
nobody denies it. But it is just as well to
remember that we probably wouldn’t have
had any sugar industry at all if we hadn’t
started on the land near home and gradually
pushed north, just as we probably wouldn’t
have had any New South Wales if we hadn’t
squatted beside Sydney Cove and allowed
the wandering cows to make tracks for us
into the country behind it. As it was, we
only just beat the Frenchmen.
And we have to remember, too, that we
can’t grow sugar as we grow wheat. At the
best, if your wheat crop goes eight bags to
the acre, it means only a little more than
half a ton to take to market; and the grain
will not harm if it is kept for months. A
cane crop will not only go more tons to the
acre than wheat will go hundredweights, but
as soon as it is cut it must be carted to the
mill. It is therefore a case of no mill no
plantation. In the Proserpine a.nd Mackay
districts there are no less than eight mills,
nearly all co-operative, and provided by the
farmers’ own capital and credit. It is quite
true that the tonnage in these districts is
low; but what shall we do about it? Shall
we tell these small farmers, to whom we are
mainly indebted for the sugar industry in
Australia, that they are in the wrong place
and deliberately proceed to make their
farms and their mills valueless? As a
matter of fact, we can be sure that most of
them will carry on even though we reduce
their earnings almost to starvation point.
That is the way of the small farmer every-
where.
There might be some reason for looking
with an unfriendly eye on these southern
growers if prices had been fixed for the
whole Commonwealth on the basis of giving
those in the poorest districts an ample
return. But actually these districts have for
years been driven to hard economies. In
Childers the milling has been reorganised :
one plant has been closed down and arrange-
ments made to do all the crushing at the
farmers’ co-operative mill. In the Bunda-
berg district three cos. own plantations and
mills, and costs of production have been
steadily reduced by technical and other
improvements; the small farmers who are
served by co-operative mills have in scores
of cases been lately earning less than a
laborer’s wage, year in, year out. In the
Ayr district the struggle has taken the shape
of a large experiment in irrigation.
Yet there is not so much difference be-
tween even the richest lands of the north
and the better lands of the south as might
be judged on a hasty comparison. Those
Ayr lands, for example, will probably pro-
duce more cheaply than the northern dis-
tricts; and actual production costs per ton
of sugar are higher in the north than on
many farms in Mackay and Bundaberg.
The Victorian sugar-consumer, who is a keen
critic of the Queensland industry, will appre-
ciate this point, at any rate. The sugar-
farmer has turned to some of these southern
districts for precisely the same reason that
the Victorian wheat-farmer has turned to the
Mallee, neglecting far richer country lying
virgin in the east —because the cost of clear-
ing the latter of its big timber makes effec-
tive occupation terribly expensive, and for
the small man practically impossible. The
cost of clearing the thick scrub of the north
and getting the land ready for the plough
throws a very heavy capital burden upon
the property and is responsible for a large
part of those high figures at which these
northern cane-farms are sometimes quoted.
And even when the clearing has been done,
the extra tonnage that the northern lands
may yield is not all profit by any means;
for the heavier rainfall means a heavier
outlay in preparing for the crop and a much
heavier outlay during the growing season.
Southern people, it is claimed, have a right
to be satisfied that they are not paying
through the nose to keep men a,t work in
the southern sugar districts when sufficient
for all purposes could be produced much
cheaper in the north. This may be ad-
mitted, with one small proviso—that the
men who pioneered the industry in the
south, and have erected mills, mostly co-
operative, are entitled to some considera-
tion: these are for the most part the small
farmers whose interests elsewhere are so
properly and so carefully safeguarded. And
that consideration is all the more necessary
because we are dependent upon them for
part of our supplies. It is true that the
northern districts are capable of growing all
the sugar Australia could consume. But
they do not grow it; Australia’s consump-
tion within three years should be 330,000
tons (it is at present over 300,000 tons),
whereas the average annual production of
all the country north of Townsville for the
past five years has been under 270,000 tons,
and only in one year was 300,000 tons
reached.' To make the north a reasonably
safe producer of all the sugar Australia
needs, at least a million and a halt would
have to be invested; and there is not e\ en
a remote possibility of such an investment
in view of the uncertainties of the mdustiy,
especially in relation to the expoit surplus.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Reality in Education.
George A. Osborne, Senior Inspector of
Schools in Victoria, describes a very im-
portant development:—
Many Australian teachers fail to achieve
greatness in their profession because they do
not realise their true objective, which is the
full and harmonious development of the
child. They concentrate on the teaching of
subjects, striving to fill the child’s mind with
facts, and consider they have been successful
if the child, at the right moment, is able
to reproduce the facts. Our methods of
examination have developed this attitude.
But the teaching of the subjects of study is
merely a means to an end. Pupils are taught
reading, writing and other fundamental sub-
jects because they are essential for effective
living. According to Professor Dewey, edu-
cation is life, consequently we have to teach
the child to live now a full life and to lay
sound foundations for his adult life. We
desire him to master the mechanics of read-
ing, because he will thus provide himself
with a key to unlock the door of the world’s
great cultural treasure-house. We teach him
elementary facts regarding hygiene, provide
courses in physical education, aud encourage
games so that, with the development of a
sound body, and controlled physical, mental
and emotional reactions, he, from this view-
point, may be enabled to live a full life. We
teach him civics, encourage participation in
sport and in other wholesome activities so
that, as a member of a team, there may be
developed in him right ideals of citizenship.
We place emphasis on that aspect of subject
matter which makes living a colorful adven-
ture in the realms of art, music and litera-
ture. We teach poetry as a joyous experi-
ence in child development. In general, we
so present our subjects of study that the
child, seeing the ultimate goal he desires to
reach, will, in order to reach it, surmount
all obstacles and overcome all difficulties in
the way. We must get still further away
from mass-teaching methods, more fully
understand the individual, and do more to
relate our teaching more closely to life.
Victoria has recently made a complete
revision of its elementary-school curriculum.
A comparison of the old and the new courses
reveals few major changes. The vital change
is the effort to make education once again
a reality by closely linking school and life,
and by teaching subjects with a view to the
full development of the child. Thus the
change is one of attitude and method rather
than of subject content.
The Australian States are steadily realis-
ing the danger of dividing all school work
into rigid subject-compartments, and are
becoming alive to the necessity, at times, of
fixing on large units or centres of interest,
and of grouping the subjects around such
centres. The unit or centre varies, and is
made to suit the locality. Such a unit or
centre may thus be forestry, or club work,
or horticulture, or other activity in which
the local community is interested. Then the
arithmetic, and the nature knowledge, and
the speech-training and remaining subjects
are related to the central activity, particu-
larly in the early stages of development.
There is always a motive for mastering a
difficulty. And difficulties will willingly be
mastered if the ultimate goal is sufficiently
attractive.
Victoria stresses extra-curricula activities
in an endeavor to get away from mere
subject-teaching. One of these activities is
school forestry. Rural schools have secured
areas of land in their districts, and are
establishing school plantations by each year
planting one acre or more with trees.
Besides being a centre of interest to the
school, the school plantation is providing a
valuable link between the school and the
community, is steadily developing not only
a love for trees, but also an abiding know-
ledge_ of their value to the nation. Similar
activities are the agricultural and pasture
plots, the school garden, the calf and poultry
clubs, _ and the Junior Red Gross Circles.
This is reality in education, and the more
we can relate school subjects to such real-
life activities the happier and healthier and
more fully-developed citizens we are likely
to develop.

N.S.W.’s Next Chief Justice.
Paragraphs keep appearing in the Sydney
dailies on the lines of one which has recently
been printed by the “S. M. Herald”: “It
is understood that Mr. Bavin will shortly
be offered a seat on the High Court bench.”
These paragraphs, it is to be feared, are not
quite honest: those who inspire them have
no great hopes that Mr. Bavin will be pro-
vided for with a seat on the High Court
bench; what they do aim at is to pave
the way for a political job—Mr. Bavin’s
appointment to the office of Chief Justice
of N. S. Wales when Street, C.J., shortly
retires. The time has already come to decide
whether such an appointment should be
made: it will be too late after it has been
made.
The position is quite simple, Mr. Bavin
was not the man to grapple with Mr. Lang;
and Mr. Bavin had to go. He retired—his
health was bad, beyond all doubt—in favor
of one better fitted to deal with the situa-
tion. Mr. Bavin deserves well of the party
for thus standing down, and for the
assistance he gave his successor. But it
would be a monstrous thing to even contem-
plate rewarding him for such a party ser-
vice by giving him a seat on the bench, let
alone the Chief Justiceship.
In considering the appointment of a Chief
Justice only one inquiry should be made—
who is the man best fitted for the high
office? A Chief Justiceship is all that the
term implies: it calls for paramount capaci-
ties. Any common-law man of fair ability
might do well enough in the numerous cases
in which a jury decides on the facts, and
there are counsel on both sides to assist on
the law; but it is altogether different in the
appellate jurisdiction where the C.J. delivers
judgments for the Full Court, and where
intricate questions involving all branches
of the law are continually cropping up. This
explains why some of Australia’s best State
CJ.’s have been Equity men. Mr. Bavin is
not a leader of the Equity or any other
Bar. For reasons which are entirely credit-
able to himself he put politics before advo-
cacy many years ago, with the result that,
outside arbitration—work which can be done
by any layman with a business training—
he is almost unknown in the courts. If Mr.
Bavin is rewarded as it is suggested he
should be, no member of the U.A.P. will
ever again be able to protest against the
Labor appointments which will certainly
follow. And these appointments will not be
confined to the State sphere; they will be-
come increasingly common in the High
Court, whose function as interpreter of the
Constitution makes it the real ruler of the
Commonwealth.
There may be nothing in the current
rumors about the State Chief Justiceship,
and the press propaganda by which they are
being fed may be the work of irresponsible
persons; but it is the Government’s duty
to set the public mind at rest. This could
be done by an announcement that no future
appointments to the .judiciary will be made
by a U.A.P. Administration except on the
advice of the Bar Council.

Getting Ready for the New Fight.
The great producers of the world are not
just sitting down and waiting for some-
thing to turn up. They are putting their
houses in order, developing new processes,
improving their organisations, opening up
new sources of supply. This all means
keener competition presently; what is Aus-
tralia doing to meet it?
One characteristic little report comes from
India. They have set up a Central Cotton
Committee; and in its laboratory at Mat-
unga there has been an investigation into
the properties of cotton fibre in relation to
its position on the surface of the seed.
Groups of 200 seeds of six standard Indian
cottons were tested over two seasons. Lint
was obtained from different parts of the
seed and subjected to. strains. Thus it
was found that there is a pronounced
difference between the lint on the apex
of the seed and that elsewhere; so by
selection not only may it be possible to
do with the cotton seed what the wool-
grower has done with the sheep, greatly in-
creasing the crop, but a method of ginning
may be devised which will remove the two
chief types of lint separately, thus doing
for cotton what the classer does for wool.
To this end attention is now turned.
And while that is being done in Asia,
something on the same lines is taking place
in Africa. There at the Roan Antelope
mines plans have been made to produce
copper at under £25 per ton. The mining
cost, originally estimated at 7s. per ton
of ore, has actually been reduced to 3s.
6s. The concentrating plant, originally
designed to treat 2,000,000 short tons a
year, will handle 3,500,000 short tons. The
original estimated cost of milling was 3s.
per ton; the actual average for the co.’s last
six months was Is. 6d. The cost of metal
for the September quarter was down to £23
per ton. It is true that we ourselves are
doing something in this way at Mt.
Isa and at Broken Hill. But the circum-
stances of both are quite exceptional. Mt.
Isa is making its experiment with American
money; it is certain that without that help
work there would have been suspended
long ago. And Broken Hill is living on the
fat which it accumulated during the period
of very high metal prices.
As for other industries in Australia, where
is there any sign of technical or any other
research? Where is there any sign of the
development of improved methods and of
new plant to put those methods to use?
The one small sign of progress or attempted
progress is in connection with the use
of wood gas for traction purposes; and that
has had perhaps one-millionth the attention
which Test cricket has commanded during
the past six months. In other directions
the tendency generally is rather to let things
deteriorate. It is certainly so in connec-
tion with our two greatest industries—the
pastoral and the agricultural.
There is, of course, an explanation: there
always is. Australia has no great supplies
of capital awaiting investment. Most of
what we have has been put aside by people
who depend on the interest it will earn for
their means to live; very little of it can
afford to wait years for a return. In these
circumstances we are, more than others,
dependent upon current savings to make
mechanical and other capital improvements.
But here Governments intrude: as we saw
last week, in one State no less than 14s.
in the £ of the last £7500 of an income of
£lO,OOO is taken by the tax-gatherer. In
every State the moment a man attempts to
employ labor in making improvements he
is taxed. He ought to be taxed for not
giving work; actually he is heavily taxed
for giving it. So things remain undone—
necessarily remain undone, in many cases;
and Australia will, in consequence, drop
further behind in the race when the world
gets back to normal, as of course, sooner
or later, it will.

Still More Douglas Credit,
From E. L. Holmes, quoted last week:—
I take objection to your statement that I
have had to twist my authorities when dealing
with, -deductions off -the “value- of manufac-
tures.” Page 620 of the “Commonwealth
Year Book,’’, 1931, gives the following:—
The value of production for any industry was
defined by the Conference of Statisticians at Sydney in
1925 as “the value of consumable commodities pro-
duced during the year, deducting, so far as possible,
the value of goods consumed in process. of pro-
duction.” In accordance with this principle a rate
was adopted for the valuation of factory production by
deducting from the value of the output the cost of
raw material, containers, , power, fuel, light, oil,
water, tools replaced, repairs to plant and
depreciation.
Douglas Credit disciples do. not say that
wages and salaries are the only purchasing
power. They do. say that the national divi-
dend would gradually replace wages and
salaries as purchasing power in the hands of
the consumer, and the widespread use of
machinery and science makes such a factor as
this an absolute necessity. The dividend
would be based on the difference between
the “value of production’’ artd the “cost of
production.”
To-day we have about 33 per cent, of our
people on the dole or relief work. Those on
relief work are not receiving wages and
salaries sufficient to give them adequate
food, clothing and shelter. Those on the
dole have no purchasing power whatever;
therefore there must be a decreasing demand,
resulting in further unemployment. When
we were building our magnificent cities and
public works, there was plenty of wages,
salaries and dividends. All these buildings
and works are now a debt on the community
and make up part of our costs to-day,
although they ceased to be purchasing power
the moment they were completed.
I must take you to task for stating that
all our loan money came here in goods. All
exporters to Australia have been paid in cash
in return for the value of their goods. All
loans to Australia have been merely figures
in bank ledgers. However, taking your own
argument, if imports are purchasing power,
what about our exports? You cannot have
it both ways. All the “purchasing power”
represented in our imports is relatively a
very small matter, whereas our exports all
represent purchasing power, less the Douglas
B charges, when they are paid for, quite
regardless of the fact that these exports
have cost more to produce than we receive.
The Douglas system is too firmly en-
trenched to be thrown overboard. All goods
produced are not “consumable” goods. The
greater amount is spent on “capital” goods,
that are assets to the nation, for which the
present system does not allow in “apprecia-
tion.”
The Douglas “just price” regulator would
prevent either inflation or deflation. It was
not inflation that ruined Germany and
Russia. It was the rise of prices faster than
the printing machine could turn out notes.
In conclusion the “national dividend” would
not be “a grand spree paid for by cashing our
great natural resources and other vague
assets and dividing up the total in notes.” A
national dividend can only be paid out of our
national wealth: wealth is communal to
have any value at all. Now, if we agree to
treat Australia as a business concern, surely
we could use the wonderful heritage that
has been handed down to us in a business-
like way. A dividend of £480,000,000 as sug-
gested by me would make little difference in
the balance-sheet of Australia, for the major
part of this would be represented in capital
goods and assets, quite apart from the com-
fort and well-being of our citizens. This need
not mean the printing of one additional note.
It could be handled through our present
Commonwealth Bank, and a national dividend
account opened in the name of every citizen
and drawn as required.
And in reply:—
There is nothing there to answer that hasn’t
been answered again and again. As a fair
sample of muddled thinking, a few moments’
attention may, however, be given to one point.
Mr. Holmes quoted the “Commonwealth Year
Boqk” as his authority for saying that,
whereas the value of Australian manufac-
tures was 390 millions, “the Government
Statist in his fairness deducts materials
used and light, fuel and power and reduces
the net value to 156 millions, out of which
known purchasing power is represented by
wages and salaries amounting to 84 millions.”
Told that the Government Statist didn’t
deduct anything in arriving at the value of
the output, Mr. Holmes now quotes a sen-
tence in which the Statists explain how
they arrive, not at the value of manufac-
tures, but at the value added in process of
manufacture. But nowhere did the statists
suggest that there was any difference
between the purchasing power of money
directly distributed as wages and indirectly
distributed in the purchase of materials. Of
every £lOOO got from sales of The Bulletin
£4OO goes for paper, ink, etc. But that £4OO
is purchasing power (it employs labor around
at Wimble’s in making ink, for example)
just as much as the £6OO which is spent on
employing labor in The Bulletin office
itself. And when Douglas’s A + B theorem
crashes, the whole edifice crashes.
«
An International Bankruptcy Court.
The debtor European Powers are in the
same 'posdaoh as the individual debtor, only
with a difference. An individual borrows
money to build a house, or gets a radio
set on time-payment, or invests his money
in a factory. His enterprise fails or he loses
his job, and so he can’t pay his debts.
In former times he used to be thrown into
gaol; and, as he couldn’t earn any money
there, he usually stayed until he rotted.
It occurred to a more or less enlightened
community that this was ridiculous and no
use to either debtor or creditor, so bank-
ruptcy courts were invented. The man who
can’t pay now goes to the Court and tells it
that he has so' many assets and so many
liabilities, and if the Judge is satisfied about
his bona fides he is told to pay what his
estate will yield’ and when he has done that
he is a free man and can start earning
for himself again.
In the case of nations it is different.
There is no International Bankruptcy Court
where a nation that-has got-in the soup can
file its schedule. So it has to repudiate.
But nations are like individuals—they love
to feel virtuous, and especially more vir-
tuous than their neighbors. Creditors always
tend to feel more virtuous than their
debtors. They can’t help feeling that some-
how they are what they are because of their
superior merits. Americans are more prone
to this feeling than most other races, pos-
sibly because of the Puritanism inherited
from the Pilgrim Fathers. Many of them
would like England to repudiate because
repudiation has a nasty sound, and if they
can fling it at another nation it will
make themselves feel superior. They won’t
be paid in gold and they can’t be paid in
goods without their Own industry being
further dislocated, but they go on dully and
stupidly demanding payment because that
makes them feel virtuous. “This hurts me
more than it hurts you,” they say, but
they go on thrashing. One of their argu-
ments is that if Europe doesn’t give them
the money it owes them it will spend it
on armies and navies, which they say is a
wicked thing to do, although they them-
selves spend as much money on their
armies and navies as any other country
and for the same reason, namely, to obtain
security.
The result is a lot of moral indignation
in America and a lot of ill-feeling and resent-
ment in Europe. Europe is in the debtor’s
prison called National Honor, with creditor
America on guard outside the gate; and, aS
far as one can see, unless both submit their
case to an International Bankruptcy Court,
they will stay in that position until they
starve.
4
Barriers to Trade.
“The removal of the barriers to inter-
national trade” is the sovereign remedy for
depression prescribed by a large body of
European economists and writers; and the
school has its vigilant representatives in
Australia. It all sounds very idealistic; but
if we removed all barriers, how should we
maintain our standard of living?
We are told that the white, by' reason of
his racial superiority, can successfully com-
pete with the colored worker in spite of
the latter’s low wages and low standards.
The white man in Australia can produce
raw sugar at not much less than £lB per
ton. The chairman and two members repre-
senting consumers and manufacturers on the
last Commonwealth Committee estimated
the 1931 cost at £lB 75.; and Brigden, head
of the Queensland Bureau of Statistics, says
that costs on farms less fertile or less
efficiently managed would be higher. At
the annual meeting of Tate and Lyle, Ltd.,
the great English refiners, held in London
in December, it was reported that “at the
end of our previous year the price of raw
sugar stood at £6 12s. 6d. for non-Empire
sugars; at the end of the 12 months now
under review, the price stood at £6.” Those
non-Empire sugars are largely Javanese, the
source of which is handy to our own door;
and if international barriers were thrown
down it is obvious that these goods, which
cost £lB to produce in Australia, could be
landed upon us at £6 or less.
And it is not the competition of only
the farm coolie that the white man’s world
would have to fear. The white man’s organi-
sation and tools are no longer infinitely
superior to the colored man’s. The
mechanisation of Asia is one of the marvels
of the world’s industry in the post-war
years. It is not easy to realise that in
Shanghai alone there are now 173 modern
flour mills—or were a year ago; 10 years
ago there were only 21. The cotton mills
of China at the end of 1921 had well under
two million spindles; at the end of 1931
they had 4-J millions. In 1930 Japanese
cotton spindles were employing 35,000 men
and 105,000 women. Ten years later they
were employing 190,000 men and 809,000
women. In 1920 there were 3668 joint stock
cos. incorporated in India. In 1929 there
were 6330, with a capital more than double
that of the earlier date, and most of the
newcomers were industrial. Of the condi-
tions under which Asiatic factory workers
live, the writer of “Labor in India” lately
drew this picture of Bombay:—
The alleyways that run between the dwellings
are narrow. There is an open drain in the centre
over which (theoretically) clothes and dishes must
be washed. There is a water pipe at one end to
supply perhaps 40 rooms, which may mean 60 or
more families. In the narrow spaces between the
drain and the walls are heaps of rubbish, and
among them hens, children, pariah dogs. As the
eye glances upwards it may see a wall variegated
by rags, boxes, matting. These indicate the stuffed-
up windows of chawls [lodgings] that have inner
tunnel-like passages. A large proportion of the
men sleep on the pavements of the city. Some
women, too, sleep outside; in most cases, however,
exhausted with her long day’s work [66 hours per
week], she huddles down to sleep in the dark,
unventilated room along with women lodgers and
their relations and their children and her own
The pungent smoke from cow-dung cakes or wood
finds its way out as best it may. The weekly
rental of these rooms is only three to five rupees.
How can the civilised nations of the earth
throw down their walls and expose their
people to the competition of great organi-
sations which are using the labor of people
content to live and work under such con-
ditions? Of the 130 greatest cotton mills
in China in 1931 no less than 48 were owned
by foreign exploiters.
Make the world one vast country so far
as trade and commerce are concerned and
we shall find Gresham’s law operating over
a wider field. For it is no truer that bad
money drives out good than that bad
(meaning cheap) labor drives out good
(meaning dear);

It is admitted quite cheerfully that the
raising of the exchange rate in Maoriland
is a political measure. “With the fall in
world prices,” one apologist says, “a defi-
nite discouragement of the primary indus-
tries had been brought about, and measures
had to be taken to give the primary pro-
ducer a greater net return.” In other words,
the exchange rate, which ought to be gov-
erned automatically by ' the supply of and
demand for Maoriland money in London, is
manipulated to serve as an export bounty.
This misuse of exchange is liable to make
the banker the legislator, and to tpat extent
is an attack on Parliament and Parliamen-
tary institutions.
In a bulletin issued at the week-end, the
Federal Country party says it is willing to
join in a national Government, but an
agreement on policy must be arrived at first.
That, of course, is only fair. “The ques-
tion of portfolios” is styled “a minor one.”
It wasn’t so regarded in other years, when
the Cockies demanded, and got, nearly half
the portfolios, though not half as strong
as their Nationalist allies; but disinterest-
edness is always acceptable, however be-
lated. And a working arrangement would be
a good thing, provided always there was no
watering-down of the national fiscal policy.
Paterson, for one, would be an acquisition
to a Government which has some very weak
members.
When Lang and Stevens were electioneer-
ing, Stevens issued a writ against liis pre-
decessor, claiming £5OOO damages for libel.
He did not go on with it, and now Lang has
got an order for costs, and his friends are
shouting that “Stevens squibbed it!”
Stevens’s litigious manoeuvres are, of course,
liis own affair, but as leader of a Govern-
ment, in matters like the motor-’buses and
the tin hares, he has shown a regrettable
tendency to start things which he doesn’t
finish. ,
Looking straight' at White, the new Cus-
toms Minister, at a Legacy Club luncheon
in Melbourne, ex-Gov. Somers said that no
amount of legislation was a panacea for
evils. Through the determination of the
people to carry on, the community would
emerge from the depths to a normal state,
and living without fear would. become the
rule again. Very eloquent and all that, but
former Under-Treasurer Michael Minogue
put it more tersely in conversation with a
colleague. Said Michael, “I believe this poqr
old country of ours will pull through in .spite
of the blanky politicians.”
“The increasing cost Of the campaign in China
is embarrassing the Japanese.”
J APAN: “If I'd known you’d such an appe-
tite, honorable sir, I’d have taken you
to a cheaper place.”
“Take up the white man’s burden !” sang
Kipling to the Americans when they found
themselves in possession of the Philippines
during'the quarrel' with Spain. They took
up the burden eagerly, but their enthusiasm
vanished with the years. Now, in a bill
passed over Hoover’s veto, they have signi-
fied that they are willing to quit within ten
years. It is an ignominious surrender of a
great trust, and an object-lesson to those
feckless people who say there is no need
for Australia to have an army, a navy
or an air force, since the U.S.A. will defend
us. The Yanks are simply making a present
of the islands to the" Japanese.
It is joyfully reported by the former pony
branch of the Sydney proprietary-racing
business that fields and crowds have in-
creased marvellously since the four pony
“clubs” became affiliated to the A.J.C. Re-
gistration of these concerns, which were
steadily going down, is a present to the
shareholders as valuable as Lang’s gifts to the
tin-hare gentry, though it is not sugggested
that some gratified pony-racing counterpart
of Swindell will pay the U.A.P.’s next lot
of election bills. In Adelaide the profits
of racing go back into the sport, and it is
obviously going to be the same in Mel-
bourne. If both Sydney parties subscribe
to the rotten principle that racing should be
carried on for private gain, with exemption
from the anti-gambling laws enforced in the
case of mere hazard-players and two-up
schools, the least they can do is to issue
racecourse licenses or leases, and charge sub-
stantially for them, so that the Crown may
get its cut.
“Unless body-line bowling is stopped at once, it is likely to upset friendly relations between
Australia and England.” —Board of Control.
DE VALERA: “Are ye all ready, b’ys? I’ll be afther givin the ould blayguard all the
body-bowlin’ he don’t want, an’ may the Divvle fly away wid friendly relations!”
Lang’s Minister Davies, back from a trip
to the country in which he was born, and
deeply conscious of what it lost when it lost
him, said to Lang’s newspaper, “England
is fast becoming a second-rate nation.”
Woodfull declines to believe it.
Sydney is seldom without a Hands-Off-
Something-or-other society. The latest is
a Hands-Off-Ireland Organisation, composed
of “Irish exiles and Australian sympathisers,”
whose enthusiasm for De Valera, expressed
in a cablegram, has-perhaps emboldened that
gentleman to go for “complete political and
economic independence.” If he brings it
off the “exiles” will lose the vote and rank
as unnaturalised aliens. Should they decide
to return, and need the services of a Consul
on the way, (they will find that their Repub-
lic has none, and that its flag is unknown
to the natives, who have a lively respect
for the i Union Jack. And in the Republic,
if they ever reach it, they will do a perish,
for _ their president, in a supreme effort
to improve on the worthy who cut off his
nose to spite liis face, will have sacrificed
90 per cent, of his country’s export trade.
By way of winding up the disastrous State
enterprises inaugurated in Theodore’s time.
Queensland’s Forgan Smiths have accepted
a tender of £16,000 for the timber yards at
Newstead and the sawmills at Yarraman and
Taromeo. Lands Minister Pease says he is
pleased with the price., What the ventures
.cost the taxpayers is not mentioned, but the
worst is feared. Stocks of timber are to be
taken over at 30 p.c., 40 p.c. and 50 p.c.
below Brisbane merchants’ prices, according
to the quality of the timber. The gross value
of these stocks at June, 1932, was given at
over £40,000.
As J. P. Jones, the Vic. Health Minister, has
intimated that he doesn’t want to be Agent-
General, the claims of Dick Linton, secre-
tary to the Cabinet, will be considered, along
with those of Under-Treasurer Pitt. The late
William McPherson, when Premier, made
Linton an honorary Minister two days before
his Government fell in 1929. Linton was the
principal advocate of the levy on wages for
unemployed-relief which has been in opera-
tion for two years or so, and he it was who
convinced the Argyles that it wasn’t fair
that_l,ooo,ooo electors should have the right
to impose income tax on 150,600 and
exempt themselves. So he is something
more than a retired business man with a
hobby for boy immigration.
Vic. municipal councils have just been
taught a lesson at the expense of Camber-
well. That rural suburb’s council, having
considered its engineer’s proposal to build
a certain concrete road, resolved to go on
with the work if it could be done for less
than the estimate. A tender below the esti-
mate was accepted and the work was done.
Unfortunately for the council the astute
lawyer Joe Woolf was one of the property-
owners who had rebelled against the expense
of a concrete road, and he took various
points—among them that because of the
addendum the resolution did not authorise
the work within the meaning of the Act.
Both the State Full Court and the High
Court having agreed with him, the council
is left with heavy law bills, as well as an
unpaid-for road.
N.S.W. Transport Department, the new
creation which controls Sydney trams,
among other things, is building 200 corridor
cars, and of course wants gears. But though
there are several Australian firms specialis-
ing in gears, and though gears they have
made for Melbourne trams show amazingly
little wear after five years’ work, the de-
partment has given the job to a Cincinnati
(U.S.A.) co., notwithstanding that Cincin-
nati gears will cost 20 p.c. more than the
Australian article. The department’s only
excuse is that the American co. offers a
300,000-mile guarantee, and there is no evid-
ence that the Australian product could do
as well. Moreover, there never will be such
evidence as long as stupid departments send
work to America and starve Australian in-
dustries. What these industries could show
in this case was a set of measurements, made
in the Government’s own shops, which should
have satisfied any reasonable person.
Trade-unions are getting a taste of the
terrific taxation to which their representa-
tives blithely condemned “the capitalists.”
Embarrassed organisations with offices at the
Sydney Trades Hall were recently served
with demands for payment of Lang’s family-
endowment tax. They are liable as em-
ployers, and there are so many of them
that their secretaries have an c organisation
of their own; but they relied on Lang to
exempt them, and “Labor’s great leader” for-
got. And workers on the Balranald border
railway are being chased for two unem-
ployed-relief taxes—Victorian and N. S.
Wales. It is an outrage, of course, but the
same two relief taxes (together with the
Commonwealth and State income taxes, and
with no abatement on money seized by the
first robber) have been extorted from “the
capitalists,” on the principle that it was
only what “the capitalists” deserved.
Westralian Premier Mitchell is sending
Senator Colebatch back to the London
agency to which he appointed his • pal for a
four-year term in 1923—they have been
warm friends for a quarter of a century.
The Lyons Government is relieved, , for it has
found Colebatch a stinging critic, and it
expects that his successor will be more
amenable. But this is by no means certain.
Labor has a good chance of returning from
the Assembly election, to be held in April,
with 28 (perhaps 30) members out of 50.
In that case it wbuld be in a position to put
in'one of its own men (probably the inex-
haustible Needham), for, though rather weak
in the Leg. Council, it would get a few votes
from members with old Labor associations.
When a State , Parliament is not in session
the Governor may, on the advice of the
Executive Council, “appoint a person to
hold the place until the expiration of 14
days after tile beginning of the next session
of tile Parliament of the State”; but this
privilege is not likely to be exercised in the
present instance. Colebatch was elected for
six years from July 1, 1929.
When Queensland Labor “amended” the
Local Authorities Act in the direction of
debarring employees of local bodies from
holding aldermanic office, it struck at J. S.
Gill, a Townsville alderman, who was clerk
of one of the local shire councils. Gill has
now resigned his shire-council job ; he had
held it for 23 years. He has nominated
again for the Townsville Council, and also
for Mayor, in order t 0 see what the Towns-
ville ratepayers think of the Government’s
performance.
In Brisbane the other day a park care-
taker in charge of a party of relief workers
sacked the lot because they knocked off for
morning-tea against orders. They appealed
to the City Council, and were put on again,
it being held that the caretaker had no right
to sack anyone. The incident was nicely
rounded off by a Labor Department ukase
—Hynes is the Minister—that morning-tea
adjournments are to be permitted without
any deduction from pay envelopes. The tax-
payers find the money, but who are the tax-
payers ?
Congressman McFadden, who recently de-
manded the cession to the U.S.A. of Bermuda
and the West Indies, has bobbed up again
with a motion to impeach Hoover. There is
a precedent for impeaching a President; in
1868 Andrew Johnson, who had been
Vice-President under Lincoln, was put on
trial for alleged high crimes and misde-
meanors. He was a very different person
from Hoover, being fond of snakejuice and
unbalanced in other respects. There was a
majority for impeachment, but it wasn’t
sufficient.
Sydney is familiar with the kind of magis-
trate that punishes the bashing of police-
men—a favorite week-end pursuit in Surry
Hills and thei'eabouts —with small fines, and
lets dangerous criminals out on light bail.
One of its stipendiaries has broken new
ground by ordering the return of money
found on convicted starting-price bookmakers,
and hitherto forfeited to the Crown, giving
as his reason that if Mcßook didn’t get it
back he mightn’t pay his “clients.” Seeing
that the “clients” are themselves lawbreakers
and parties to tax-frauds, this teiider con-
sideration for them is out of place. But
it has been reserved for a country magistrate
to dismiss a case against a sozzled driver
whose car capsized, causing death and serious
injury. Defendant admitted having had “six
mugs of beer,” and a Government medical
officer described him as having been “defi-
nitely under the influence.” Then the magis-
trate laid down the law, as he saw it: —
It is reprehensible conduct on the part of the
driver of a car to be under the influence of liquor
when driving, but it has to be shown conclusively
that such driver is not able to control the car.
N. S. Wales employs two Law Ministers,
though every other State gets along with
one. Is it no part of either gentleman's
duty to bring amazing magistrates tb book?
“At a conference on foreign affairs at Washington,
the U.S. Government decided on a war-debts con-
ference with Britain. Half a dozen other inter-
national conferences are sitting or are in a state of
suspended animation.”
“Shall I ever struggle out of this collar?”
A cable says that Angwin, whom Cole-
batch is to succeed, will be unable to
present himself as a candidate at the West-
ralian elections because he has not been a
resident for years past. Nevertheless he
might find precedents. In 1908 the late J.
L. Nanson returned to Westralia after some
years in England, during which he read law
and was admitted to the Bar. and plunged
straightway into a Parliamentary contest
which resulted in his recapture of his old
seat and his appointment as Attorney-
General.


SOCIETY
"And it's

WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Bloggs”: Bulletin contributors have
tried more than once to say what a “gentle-
man” is, but I have never seen an attempt
made to define a “gent.” Yet Sydney is
teeming with gents. The following veracious
anecdote may throw a certain light on the
question. Mrs. Cohenstein, one of those
hostesses who get plenty of limelight from
the press girls, was being overpoweringly
charming to young Mr. Bunion —one of the
Edgecliff Bunions. “And I hear, Mr. Bunion,
that you have-" been fishing. Was I rightly
informed?” “You were, Mrs. Cohenstein.”
“And did you have a successful day’s sport,
Mr. Bunion?” “Oh, pretty fair, Mrs. Cohen-
stein, pretty fair.” “ Indeed , Mr. Bunion !
But how exciting! And what did you catch,
Mr. Bunion?” “Well, we got half a dozen
snapper, some red bream, a few trevally. a
coupler sharks and, er —pardon me, Mrs.
Cohenstein —three jewfish.” This punctilious
repudiation of anything in the nature of anti-
Semitism, this courteous insistence that no
slight on the lady’s race was intended, seems
to me to indicate the perfect gent., but the
feat of putting him into a phrase is beyond
me. Can any other Bulletin reader do it?
“Ike Hollar”: There has been at least a
little originality in the naming of Aus-
tralian papers (B. 18/l/’33). Probably the
liveliest country newspaper N.S.W. has
known was poet E. J. Brady’s Grafton
“Grip,” whose voice had an echo all over
Australia, largely as a result of the editor’s
habit of spreading marked copies amongst,
other editors. A “Tickler” was once pub-
lished in Duttedin (M.L.). Sydney had a
“Joker” and a eomic paper christened
“Vumps,” Jack Higgins (now M.L.C.) being
mainly responsible for it. “What does
‘Vumps’ mean?” he was asked. “Dashed if
I know,” he returned. “That’s the idea —
everybody will want to know, and nobody
will be able to tell them.” Public curiosity,
however, was insufficient to enable the paper
to survive more than a few issues. There
was a “White Australian” also, founded with
a capital of 12s. 6d. by Bernard Ingleby. It
lasted for two numbers.
* * * *
“Frig”: Kew (Vic.) claims to have wit-
nessed the first investiture of a V.C. in
Australia. Private Whirlpool, of the Haw-
thorn and Kew Rifles, was presented
with the cross by Lady Barkly at a review
of the troop on June 20, 1861. He had been
awarded it for conspicuous gallantry in the
Indian Mutiny.
“Leo Lear”: The Bulletin’s list of Aus-
tralian V.C.’s omits one of the first —if not
the very first. Rolf Boldrewood in “Old
Melbourne Memories” records that in 3844
the Browne homestead, just established at
Squattleseamere, was attacked by blacks,
and that an employee named Joe Burge
assisted in driving them off. “Joe was afraid
of nothing and nobody. And when years
after his son returned from India with the
Queen’s commission and the/ Victoria Cross,
I knew where the bold blood had come from.”

“Isle of Girls”: Rottnest Island has
had a new distinction fastened upon it.
HIS MISTAKE.
“You look to me like the sensible woman who would make a nice wife to a
comfortable old yuan like me.”
“Oh no, I'm not, Doctor I’m really a lot more sensible than I look.”
According -to the “West Australian’s” cen-
tenary number, which is something of a
history of the' State in miniature, Rottnest
was the scene of the first duel fought in
Australia. Wcstralian records contain an
account of at least one bona fide duel, when
an early-day ; journalist and another citizen
blazed away at each other among the Fre-
mantle sandhills, but the Rottnest encounter
happened long before that. In fact, it hap-
pened before the Swan River settlement was
founded; the duellists were two officers on
a French man-of-war, who utilised the island
for giving each other satisfaction with
swords. The date and the result and the
very names of the participants are lost.
“Free Companion”: The discovery under
the roof of a house in Orange (N.S.W.) of
some thousands or
.303 rifle cartridges
has roused the Sydney
press to a series of
wild surmises. It is
darkly conjectured
that they were stored
against a Commun-
ist rising. In the
Boer War the roof
was a favorite hiding
place for the rifles
and cartridges of
burghers, who planted
them there before go-
ing into the nearest
dorp to take the oath
of allegiance and neu-
trality and hand in
some old bundook that
had seen service on
the Great Trek.
Whenever De Wet or
some other raider
came along, the hidden
articles were produced
by their owners. They
were often a dashed
nuisance, too, when
Boer farmhouses sus-
pe c t of harboring
train-wreckers were
burned. Many a mili-
tary incendiary has been scared half to death
by the unexpected explosion of a thousand
rounds or so of ammunition just as he was
souveniring before the fire took too good a
hold.

“Molls” • Jay Peas, one has heard, are
occasionally appointed by mistake, through
some confusion in names, but it seems hardly
credible that the same thing could occur
in the case of a Supreme Court Judge. Yet
a Wcstralian paper revives the story that
this is exactly what did happen a trifle over
a quarter of a century ago in that State.
There were so much jealousy and rivalry and
general cantankerousness and (incidentally)
political partisanship in -the local Bar that
the Government of the day decided to
send to England for a Judge. It got one,
and he proved so excellent that, another
vacancy occurring, it was decided to repeat
the experiment. The Agent-General was
asked to consult* with the Inns of Court
benchers for the recommendation of a man,
and he did so. But there were two barris-
ters of the same name—one at the Middle
Temple and the other at Lincoln’s Inn —and
through some mix-up in initials the wrong
one was invited to come and be a Judge at
Perth. H'e accepted, and when the mis-
take was discovered it was too late to
correct it. The new Judge got on all right,
except for the fact that many of his judg-
ments were upset. But lie was a thoroughly
good fellow and, once that was realised, the
mistake about his appointment was smoth-
ered up.
“F.1.A.T.”: The N.R.M.A. and other
bodies which try to make the roads safer
keep stressing the importance of better and
better brakes, steering gear, etc. The fact is
only about 3 p.c. of accidents in this country
are due to structural defects in cars; and
in the TJ.K. the percentage is even less.
Nearly all accidents everywhere are due
to mental or moral defects in drivers, exacer-
bated occasionally by weather conditions, as
when a slightly sozzled motorist travels
AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE.
“She’s fifty, if she’s a day. Women wear better than men, don’t they?
“Ye-e-es—but not so much.”
through a city on a wet night at 25 m.p.h.
or over. Therefore attention should be con-
centrated on checking, or anyhow minimising,
careless driving in obvious danger zones. All
bridges are dangerous, particularly the Syd-
ney one with its treacherous surface in rainy
weather. All roads leading into crowded
main thoroughfares are dangerous at their
points of intersection. The rule about the
car on the left having no rights is almost
useless; many beginners are ignorant of it,
and many flash experts ignore it. Rules
against jay-walking are also useless unless,
as in parts of Melbourne, they are empha-
sised by policemen who stfow pedestrians
not only where they mustn’t cross, but
where they must. In Sydney my observa-
tions as a motorist have satisfied me that
fully 50 per cent, of those knocked down by
cars are jay-walkers ; that most of the others
are workers’ children; that 00 per cent, of
collisions occur at cross-roads, and that in
practically every case an accident might
have been avoided, or made a good deal less
damaging, if the motorist hadn’t been travel-
ling too fast —“driving out of hand,” as they
used to say in the horse era. In short, those
who aim at safety first will have to direct
their attention to drivers first. All said and
done it is the criminally flash or criminally
incompetent driver who is; killing hundreds
and maiming thousands in Australia year by
year.

“Oxmead”: The man who hurls a brick
through a jeweller’s window in broad day-
light and grabs a tray or two of diamond
rings is always cropping up somewhere; he
gave Sydney a turn last week. After the
marauder had fled with his plunder events
moved rapidly and sensationally enough to
have provided material for a thrilling Holly-
wood film. An enterprising assistant leaped
over the counter and chased a man who tore
through an underground station and was
finally run down in a pub, where (according
to one account) he was just about to refresh
hiinself with a beer. Here pursuer and
pursued grappled with one another, while
peaceful customers stood by wondering what
the scrap was about and which of the pair
had started it. The police presently arrived
to prise them apart; later, at the police
station, a captive with a badly cut wrist
was charged with stealing diamonds valued
at f 3 MOO. Meanwhile the jeweller was
standing outside his shop, having his 4 faith
in human nature revived or strengthened by
“one person after another walking up and
restoring to him diamond rings” picked up
along the line of chase. At latest accounts
he had got them all back but 'nine, and was
still sanguine of those turning up ; “it shows
how honest most people are,” was his appre-
ciative comment. T

“Adelaide”: The four-masted schooner
Fides, after lying idle in the Port river for
four years, is being broken up for firewood
—2OO tons, estimated by the Methodist Mis-
sion, which has bought it. It is said to
have cost £35,000 to build in England just
after the war, but since it left the Baltic
trade for Australia in 1927 it has had no-
thing but bad luck. Cyclones on the way
sent it into port for repairs in Anjerica, arid
again in Brisbane, and by the time it reached
Adelaide the M.L. timber trade, for which
it was meant, had gone dead. So the Fides

which, he explains, occur through the light-
ning taking a branched path to earth In
a case the other day in N. 8- Wales
the youth who was struck had nurrierous
fern traceries on his body, which the pro-
fessor terms “tissue effects.” These effects
are frequently seen on metal objects, and
aforetime authors used the idea that, they
were due to lightning photography with fine
effect, a once-popular writer making her
case turn on a representation of a crime
stamped by lightning upon a glass door.
SNAPPING-POINT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Board of Control has warned the M.C.C.
by cable that leg-theory or body-line bowling, unless
stopped at once, is likely to upset friendly rela-
tions between England and Australia.’’
We have loved you ever and aye, England,
as loyal sons and true;
There’s little enough, as we oft have shown,
w r e wouldn’t do for you.
Faithful and constant, we’ve always made
your weal our guiding star,
But you mustn’t try us too far, Mother, you
mustn’t try us too far.
There were little rifts in the far-off days,
and tempers at times grew rough
When you thought we could take more con-
victs here and we reckoned we’d had
enough.
Bet you found us tolerant chaps, Mother,
and patient, you must allow,
And this is why we appeal to you to listen
to reason now.
There was never a game in all the world to
thrill like cricket, none,
Since on old Eton’s playing fields grim
Waterloo was won.
We have played it in friendly rivalry for
fifty years and more,
Since a thousand made a handsome gate
and fifty a decent score.
We have had our triumphs and beatings,
both: have known fat years and thin;
Have taken victory equably, defeat with a
cheerful grin,
And always come up smiling again, as you’re
perfectly well aware,
But this isn’t playing it fair, Mother, this
isn’t playing it fair.
To bowl where a batsman’s pads may be, or
possibly his hips,
With five men packed close in at leg and
never a soul in the slips;
To make him take his choice ’tween getting
a knock or giving a catch—
That isn’t the way the old-time champs
.would have tried to win a match.
It wasn’t the way the demon Spofforth Eng-
land’s best would fix,
Or Boyle performed, or Turner the terror
rattled the foemen’s sticks.
What “W.G.” would have growled in his
beard as he picked them off his toes,
Those vicious yorkers and swift expresses,
only the good Lord knows!
All’s fair in love and war alike —-one’s heard
that, view expressed;
But cricket’s only a game, Mother, from a
village match to a Test.
Leg-theory or body-line, we reckon the new
dodge dirt;
It not only lessens the gate receipts—it’s
patently apt to hurt.
They’re utterly over the odds, Mother;
they’re deadly crimes almost,
These balls that whistle about the ears and
threaten the ribs to roast.
There’s none Sq loyal to your little isle as
we Australians are,
But now you’re giving our fealty a most
decided jar.
You mustn’t try us too far, .Mother, you
shouldn’t try us too far.

WRONG NUMBER.
TOURIST FROM SDNEY: “Wonder what happens to all
these telephone girls when they instal automatic
exchanges?”
OFFICER (from Sydney, too ): “Oh, they use ’em for
drawing the lotteries.”
“Jungor”: The Queensland railways are
beset with passengers who pay no fares,
and all sorts of expedients are being em-
ployed to discourage them. They aren’t all
males, either. The police at Gympie re-
ceived word the other day that 15 travellers
“on the nod” were in occupation of a couple
of trucks on a goods train, and that instruc-
tions had been given for the train to be
speeded up before approaching the station
so that it would be difficult for them to
alight unobtrusively. Nevertheless ten of
them “made a dangerous jump,” and escaped
falling into the law’s clutches. One of those
who refused to try to leap was a woman, who
was lightly attired in “dungaree trousers,
an old military jacket, green slippers with
silver bows and a peaked cap.” The beak
shook his head over her appearance and
reckoned that a month’s imprisonment would
be better for her than careering about the
country with hoboes.

“Norbell”: Ever since I can remember
there has been a pleasant legend that the
proprietors of “a certain consultation” had
accumulated a hoard of cash belonging to
forgetful ticket-holders. It used to be a
popular belief that George Adams built the
ornate Marble .Bar in Pitt-street, Sydney,
from this unclaimed reserve fund, and that
it cost £30,000 or £loo,ooo—l forget which.
But the other day I happened on an official
list of unclaimed prizes, and I could
only make the total £1930 11s. 6d. The
biggest wad unclaimed is £lOO, due to some
absent-minded beggar in Westralia. A prize
of £9B 10s. 2d. is due to a Kaniva (Vic.)
syndicate, and five £5O prizes are awaiting
owners. But mostly the prizes put by
in the cupboard are for £5 or thereabouts.
A casual Australian, one Bob Cooper, whose
address is a station near Derby (W.A.),
has two prizes waiting for him, £5O and £5,
for two consecutively-numbered tickets —
almost a miracle, one would think. Inci-
dentally, I learn that all unclaimed prize
moneys, after being kept in hand for six
years, are paid into the State Treasury.

“Wayback”: “Murkah” states that death
or dreadful injury must be the result of
jumping off Sydney Harbor Bridge (B.
11/l/’33). Yet, shortly after the Brooklyn
(U.S.) bridge was opened one Steve
Brodie showed that such a feat need not
involve serious consequences. He jumped in
a crouching position, arms at side, each
hand holding a 101 b. dumbbell. At the close
of his descent he straightened out his logs
and struck the water feet foremost, rising
to the surface as soon as he let go the dumb-
bells, when he was picked up by a
rowboat. His performance brought him in
enough cash to start a saloon in the Bowery,
and suicides from the Brooklyn bridge be-
came less frequent.

“Saltbush Bill” : When the controllers of
the shark-proof bathing enclosure at Coogee
(N.S.W.) decided to rubber-stamp the palms
of outgoing bathers who desired to return
shortly, instead of issuing pass-out checks,
they laid up trouble for themselves.
Prompted, probably, by some visiting urchin
from the great open spaces with recollections
of the sheep-branding race on the old home-
stead, the youngsters who form a considerable
portion of the enclosure’s patrons immedi-
ately started a game of “sheep.” This con-
sisted in running continuously in at the en-
trance gate and out at the exit, submitting to
be branded each time. It is estimat'd that
on the opening day some 15,000 stamps were
placed on the ingenious nippers before the
gatemen realised they were being martyred to
make a Coogee holiday. At last advices, the
enclosure authorities were busy figuring out
the amount of branding ink expended, to say
nothing of the wear and tear of the rubber
stamps.

“Ibn el Issar” : The urge for propaganda
has stirred the calm of the immemorial East,
for the cables tell us that a syndicate of
Rajput princes has purchased the Allahabad
“Pioneer,” one of India’s oldest and best
British journals. Doubt-
less it is to be used as the
official organ of the rulers
of the Native States in the
controversy as to the
settlement of Hind under
the proposed self-govern-
ment scheme. The princes,
friendly enough to' their
ally, Britain, from whom
they hold their privileges
under special treaties, most
of which date back to the
days of John Company, are
set on maintaining their
rights as independent
rulers under the Sirkar,
being by no means pre-
pared to be thrown into
the kitty with the other
numberless peoples and
classes which make up
India’s population. It was
to the “Pioneer” that a be-
spectacled cub came as a
junior reporter from the
school at Westward Ho
which he has immortalised
in “Stalky and Co.” Some
of Kipling’s best work, in-
cluding the fine “Letters
of Marque,” was done for
the “Pioneer.”

“Mr. Chucks”: The
story of the souveniring
lady who raided the cur-
tains of the royal cabin
and said she had helped to
pay for them recalls that
the gag used to be a favo-
rite one with acquisitive
members of the public who
went aboard warships in
the old days. It was then
the custom for the ratings
keeping an eye on proceed-
ings to have handy a small
supply of “shakings” or
similar worthless junk.
When a visitor fired off the
time-worn jape, he or she
was handed a tiny piece of
the rubbish and told it was
his or her share. That
was in the days before sail
had vanished. What they
do now I don’t know —tender a scrap of
steel shavings, perhaps.

“Yagan”: The Commonwealth Census
Bureau estimates the number of full-blooded
aboriginals at 59,719. Westralia is credited
with most (24,883) ; then comes the North-
ern Territory (18,777). Queensland is
given 13,372, N. S. Wales 925 and Vic. a
mere 50. I don’t know how our enterpris-
ing statisticians get the figures for these
exact calculations; in the Territory and the
hinterland of Nor’-Westralia there must still
be natives whom no white man has ever seen,
and perhaps in the north of Queensland, too.
Yet, if the tally is only approximately cor-
rect, it suggests that Binghi is dying out
much more slowly than most people think.
What the native population was when the
First Fleet arrived obviously nobody knows
or ever will know. All sorts of estimates have
been made; but (says the “Australian Ency-
clopaedia) “modern writers show remarkable
unanimity in recording the aboriginal popu-
lation at the time of the settlement of Euro-
peans as 150,000.” And 12 years ago, at
the 1921 census, the number was given as
58,711, which indicates a slight increase in
the last decade. Probably, now that the
abo. is better looked after than ever before,
he may yet turn out to be on the up-grade

“Light Horse”; It isn’t only in the Kala-
hari that wild melons come in handy for
thirst-quenching (B. 18/l/’33). Many an
outback bushman has thanked his staffs
when he has;been lucky enough to strike a
patch of “pie-melon,” and Black Brother was
perfectly well aware of their usefulness in
this respect. The Bedouin of Sinai were
reputed to resort to the little wild melons
of the desert when water was absent, but it
must have been an acquired taste. A squad-
ron of the Ist Light Horse was moving into
position just before the battle of Bir el Abd
opened. A patch of the wild melon was
encountered, and every man was off his horse
in a moment and digging his teeth into the
succulent objects. The subsequent language
gave the desert an extra blistering. Aloes
or gall were honey to those melons, and the
readers of Kipling among the sufferers
realised what the poet meant when he wrote
of “the bitter Icarela.”
“Worst Seller”:
The fate of Aldous
Huxley’s “Brave
New World,” which
has been banned by
the Commonwealth
censor, is an indi-
cation of the recep-
tion that almost
any novel of out-
standing merit and
originality may ex-
pect in this coun-
try. Here is a well-
advertised and -re-
viewed work by
one of the half-
dozen most cele-
brated writers of
the day. It has
been on sale in Syd-
ney for nearly four
months at 7s. 6d.,
and about 350
copies have been
bought—profit for
the author (at the
usual flat rate of
3d. a copy), a little
over £4! Of course,
now that the censor
has crowned it as
obscene, there will
be a rush for the
remaining copies,
and second-hand
ones will fetch fancy
prices, but that
has nothing to do
with the case. The
point is that with-
o u t adventitious
aids —p ulp i t or
other attacks on
the score of blas-
phemy or indecency
—t. here is no
market for thought-
stimulating fiction
among our intelli-
gentsia. Australia’s
novel-reading pub-
lic has an almost
completely Ethel Dellish mind.

created a final sensation by destroying him-
self before he coukl be taken from the court
to gaol. But Wright had been out on bail —
himself in £25,000 and two sureties of the

for the worst by carrying a small phial of

“Snell”: Touching the mention in an
American paper of President Hoover’s
appointment in 1897 as manager of the Sons
Q wa lia (W.A.), “where the water diffi-
cuity was acute” (B. 11/l/’33), the beer
difficulty in that isolated settlement was
ba rdly less so. Hundreds of miners were
emp loyed on the big mine in Hoover’s time

ralian show outside of the Golden Mile —

three miles away. The consequence was that
every second person one met seemed to be

Then the Government stepped in (Walter
James was Premier) and killed sly-grogging
in one act by establishing a State hotel at
Gwalia, one of the few successful Govern-
ment enterprises on record in that or any
other State. There seems to be something
of the irony of Fate in the fact that Hoover’s
U.S. Presidency was mainly terminated
because his party took the wrong side on
the question of whether beer should be sold
by licensed persons or unlicensed ones.

“Simiacino”: Years ago that fine novelist
Seton Merriman wrote a story dealing with
the discovery in the Congo of a herb which
increased beyond all imag-
ining the strength and
courage of human beings
and others that ate it.
Now comes news that a
German scientist has iso-
lated a chemical which pro-
duces the same effect. Ex-
periments have shown that
under its influence sheep
and cats fought and killed
dogs, cats became as
ferocious as leopards, and
mice developed a hostility
which made uninoculated

SONG OF THE ROYER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Maybe I am but a chip of life,
Afloat on the sea of time;
But I’ve lived before, and I’ll live again,
In every age and clime.
And you, with your polished finger-nails,
With your office an’ cars an’ such:
Where would you be if it wasn’t for me
An’ the rest of the roving clutch?
It’s great to lie beneath the spread of a lonely
desert tree
(Be sure that I wouldn’t change vyith yon
any more than you’d change with me),
As less I dream of the things that were or
are than of things to be,
For the world is wide and there still remain
a million things to see.
A beckoning song in the whining wind;
patter and thrash of the rain;
A wind-whipped cloud in a stormy sky; a
thought, and we’re off again
To God knows what or why or where —to
Devil or drought or flood.
For go we must in search of the source of
the song in the wanderer’s blood.
In the hazy hills of the far outback are a
thousand mysteries deep.
And there they’ve lain ten thousand years in
quiet, unbroken sleep;
Till one with an understanding heart shall
seek and find and cry:
“Awake ! Awake ! For the time has come I”
And we wonder “Will it be I?”
Oh! most men only dream of things that are
sold or bartered or bought,
But wanderers dream of the things that lure,
of the things that must needs be sought.
For the tang lies deep in the chase of it, in
the reckless depths of the trough
That bars the way to achievement’s goal,
though that end be bubble and froth !
I am but a chip on the sea of time,
And maybe I talk too straight,
But where would you be except for us,
What matter your rank or state?
So polish the shine on your finger-nails,
An’ posture an’ play to the crowd,
At the end of the game we’ll finish the
same.
The smooth and the rough—in a shroud.
QUEENSLAND.

ITEMS
Rev. Chas. L’Oste, who lately passed liis
104 in Tasmania, is a bachelor. Still it
isn’t safe to trust to singleness to give one
a long life. Of 28 people who died in Aus-
tralia in 1930 and were registered as cen-
tenarians, 24 had been married.
An Anglican Dean of Melbourne is shortly
to be appointed to succeed Dean Aitken,
who retired some months ago, and it is sug-
gested that the office should be combined
with that of coadjutor-bishop to Archgaiters
Head. Among the names mentioned is that
of Bishop Hart of Wangaratta, who was pre-
viously Dean of Melbourne, but was not as
much appreciated as he is now. Bigger revenue
immediately from the extension of the lease
of the land on which the Metrop. Gas Co.
stands, and from St. James’s Buildings,

the financing of a dean or dean-coadjutor-
bishop easier.
Patrick Lawlor, of Camberwell (Vic.),
who died at Rome last year on his way home
from the Eucharistic Congress, left estate
valued at over £llO,OOO. Shares valued at
over £28,000 and one-hailf of his residuary
estate are to be held by the R.C. Archbishop
of Melbourne and other trustees to form
the nucleus of a fund to establish . a
daily paper. In addition to legacies
to friends and’ £lOOO for the poor of three
parishes in the Irish. Free State, over
£25,000 worth of shares was left to about
20 Melbourne charities. Ironically enough,
most of the shares bequeathed for the
foundation of another daily were in the
“Herald.”
On the strength of a statement in Johns’s
“Notable Australians,” The Bulletin last
week said that J. F; Archibald was only 22
when he founded The Bulletin. But a
copy of its founder’s birth-certificate, which
The Bulletin got for its jubilee number
(Jan. 29, 1930), showed that Archibald had
just had his 24th birthday (Jan. 14) when
the first number was issued.

ham, Derby and BrOome. Then they shifted
him to Perth, where in due course he took
over charge of the metropolitan district. He
did well enough there ; but nothing that, he
can ever do will dim the record of his 13
years’ patrol work in the north.
The Marquess of Hertford, now on his
way to Sydney, is one of the oddities of the
British peerage. H’e was in Australia 30-odd
years ago as the Earl of Yarmouth. Skirt-
dancing was the rage, and the young man
careered round local stages and drawing-
rooms draped after the manner of Letty
Lind, in yards of muslin. He married a
sister of Harry Thaw in 1903, but she got
a nullity decree five years later.
Had a 94th birthday in Perth the other
day, Mrs. John Fairfax Conigrave, who was
six years old when her parents brought her
from Shropshire to Adelaide after a voyage
that took six months. During the war the
old lady published a book of her early remi-
niscences for the benefit of the Red Cross.
Her father was Charles Price, who brought
the first Hereford cattle and Shropshire
Down sheep to S. Aus.
The Melbourne Stock Exchange lost its
oldest member when George Woodforde
(elected nearly 45 years ago) died in St.
Ivilda. Woodforde, a keen racing man, was
for 30 years on the committee of the V.A.T.C.,
and was chairman of the club for 10 years
in all. In 1891 he won the Caulfield Cup
with G’Naroo.
Mrs. Alice Hindson, who recently died in
Kew (Vic.), was the youngest daughter of
Frances Henty, who landed at Portland Bay
in 183-1, and took up Merino Downs three
years later. The only two surviving children
of the four Henty pioneers are George
Henty, of Sydney, and Mrs. Nellie Coster
(M.L.). Stephen Henty was their father.

for politics in the useful school of jour-

Wellington (N.S.W.) has lost its well-
loved Monsignor Long in his 79th year.
Ho was born in Kilkenny (Ireland),
and was in training for the. priesthood
when the first Bishop of Maitland (Dr.
Murray) made an appeal for missionaries
for the newly-created Bathurst diocese. The
young student was one of the volunteers;
he arrived in Australia 57 years ago and
was ordained soon afterwards. Monsignor
Long had been parish priest at Wellington
for a quarter of a century.
“Wai-lioi”: • Real old Northern Terri-
torians are thinning out. Tom Pearce, at
76, has finished up at Darwin ; his Father
Christmas beard will be missed in the tropical
capital. Over 50 years ago T.P. went north
from Willunga (S.A.) with Joe Cooper,
who, later, was to account for thousands
of water buffaloes on Melville Island and
the mainland. Though Pearce did not have
such an adventurous time as his mate, he
could tell exciting yarns about early happen-
ings in Australia’s unguarded asset. Cooper
is still on deck in Darwin at close on 80.
James French, who retired recently from
the Maffra (Vic.) shire secretaryship, had
held the job for an unbroken period of 43
years. H’e witnessed the first land selection
in the district, helped to plant the first
samples of sugar-beet and lived to see the
establishment of a Government sugar fac-
tory.
Torn Wigley is dead in Adelaide at 75,
after a long illness. He was a lawyer, with
sport as a strong sideline; starter and
afterwards stipendiary stewmrd for S. A.
Jockey Club, and at one time a fairly suc-
cessful owner. Also he had a big hand in
saving Morphettville course for the club.
Ivor Hole, the Adelaide boy who made a
sensation while still in his teens with power-
ful black-and-white work (at first ob-
viously under Norman Lindsay influence,
but later outgrowing that), has returned to
S. Aus. from a tour of Eurppe. “The mod-
ernistic stuff with streaks and triangles and
loops has definitely gone,” he says. “A
few of the masters, like Picasso, can still
get away with the eccentric. But painting
is returning to the solid foundations.” Hele
thinks home is the best place for Australian
artists at present, and he is going to try
his luck in Sydney.
Dr. E. P. Leavy, dead in North Queens-
land at 77, was one of the pioneers of the
now rich sugar district of Innrsfail, where
he pitched his tent 40 years ago. In the
early days as Government medical officer he
did great work agMpst the malarial fever
which was then a scourge of the country-
side. A graduate of Trinity, Dublin, he
saw some * active service, after leaving the
college, with the Royal Irish Rifles. _ _ A
deeply-read man, he was also a musician
of parts.
Sir Aldo Castellani, who has been
appointed Director-in-Ohief of the Ross
Institute for Tropical Diseases, was born m
Italy in 1875, and has been for years direc-
tor of tropical medicine at the institution he
now controls. A world-wide authority on
tropical diseases, he it was who proved that
sleeping sickness, which has decimated many
areas of tropical Africa, was due to the
transmission of a parasite for the tsetse fly,
and his discovery opened the way for con-
trolling and curing, the disease. He also
isolated the microbe responsible for yaws,
prevalent in New’, Guinea and other parts of
the Western Pacific. He rendered valuable
war service by preparing mixed vaccines
(typhoid, paratyphoid A and B, and
cholera), which permitted several vaccina-
tions occupying several weeks to be sOper-
seded by one.
Noel Bayliss, who was Victorian
Rhodes scholar in 1927, is returning to Mel-
bourne Uni., where he graduated B.Se. at
Queen’s College, having been appointed lec-
turer in chemistry at his old Alma Mater.
Bayliss was at Lincoln College, Oxford,
where he took a first-class in chemistry;
after that a Commonwealth Fund fellow-
ship carried him t 0 the University of Cali-
fornia, where he has been engaged in
research work for the past two years.
Moss Davis, a former .Aucklander, who
died the other day in London at 86, always
kept a Warm corner in bis heart for Maori-
land. The Auckland Museum is indebted
to him for many works of art and historical
relics. He returned to England in 1907 and
during the war was a strenuous worker for
Dominion soldiery. Qn his eightieth birth-
day he forwarded £1250 to be distributed
among Auckland charities. Moss Davis and
his wife (who survives him) kept their
diamond wedding at Monte Carlo a couple
of years ago.
Maoriland Finance Minister William
Downie Stewart, who resigned last week
because the Forbes Ministry, against his
advice, bumped the exchange rate from 10
p.c. to 25 p.c. above sterling, was the most
scholarly member of the Cabinet. Son
of another Downie Stewart who was
prominent in politics, Downie the younger,
who is 54, graduated as LL.B. in
1900, and before commencing practice as
a lawyer had a year or so of travel in
Siberia* and China, keeping an interested eye
on the Russo-Jap War. He entered Parlia-
ment as representative of the western elec-
torate of his home town, Dunedin, in 1914,
but went off to the war with the Otago
Regiment, an experience that left him lame,

and with his health permanently impaired.
Despite that handicap he joined Massey’s
Cabinet as Minister of Internal Affairs and
Customs in 1921, and five years later was
acting-P.M., Attorney-General and Minister
of Finance. In 1910, in collaboration with
Prof. Le Rossignol, he wrote “State Social-
ism in N.Z.” JvVell liked-in the House by

was attracted to medicine. After graduat-
ing at the University of California, he went
to Scotland and got a further degree from
Edinburgh. During the war he served with
two armies—John Bull’s and Uncle Sam’s.
The Royal Society of Tropical Medicine sent
him to Malaya and Abyssinia after the war
to study malaria and other problems, and
last year the Pacific Institute of Tropical
Medicine put him in charge of a relief ex-
pedition to Manchuria to combat the pneu-
monic plague that was wiping out more
Chinese and Japanese than the guns were. '
Herbert Robinson, managing director of
11. E. C. Robinson, Ltd., who died last week
in Sydney at 76, did a great deal for the
diffusion of knowledge. For half a century
he made map-making his hobby as well as
his business, and his maps were valued all
over the world. In addition to his output
for schools and colleges, he assisted or
co-operated with many eminent scientists
(including Professor Edgeworth David) in
charting of a technical and scientific nature.
A native of Winchester, Robinson came to
Australia as a lad with his father, and
after a few years as a draftsman in the
N.S.W. Lands Department, settled down to
what was to be his life’s work.
A well-deserved bouquet has been thrown
by the Kew (London) Garden authorities
at Leonard Rodway; they have put it on
record that he has been “a valued corres-
pondent of Kew since 1887,” and regret that
ill-health has driven him to resign the hon.
job of Tasmanian botanist. Rodway (father,
by the way, of artist Florence) has done a
vast amount of honorary work for the Speck
he loves so well—at the university, on the
Scenery Preservation Society, as trustee of
the Botanic Gardens and as adviser of the
Forestry Department. .
Rev. J. J. Brown, a widely-known and
popular Methodist minister (Vic.), has died
in harness, after 55 years of active service.
With his brother, Rev. Ralph Brown, in
the ’eighties he went on a lecturing (“Heads
and Faces,” “Love, Courtship and Mar-
riage,” etc.) and preaching tour through
England and U.S.A.; phrenological leadings
and charts were a sideline in their campaign.
The brothers landed in Yankeeland with
7s. 6d. and returned with cash in hand.
Church funds locally benefited by their con-
cluding lecture, “Around the World on
Three Half-crowns.”
Lance Stirling, president of S.A. Leg.
Council and of all sorts of companies and
clubs, is to be commemorated by a tower at
Strathalbyn, of which he was the local
“squire.” Very Scotch in its founding, the
pretty town in the hills 85 miles from Adel-
aide has always had a Presbyterian tower
as its chief landmark. The new one is to
go with the Anglican church.

•Subject to specific reserves.
This is the subsidiary which took over the
Australian section of the Nestle and Anglo-
Swiss Co.’s world-wide business in 1921 for
£2,650,000 —£2,500,000 in fully-paid ords. and
the balance cash 1 . To provide for expansion,
including the erection of a chocolate factory
at Abbotsford, Sydney, the public put up
a further million in 8 p.c. cum. prefs. (the
div. was guaranteed by the parent). Ordi-
naries, even in good times, took no more than
34 p.c.
The business has fallen away sharply
of recent years. In Victoria alone the
value of the condensed milk output for
the whole State shrank from £1,832,227
for 1927-28 to £775,324 for the year to June
30,1931. At that date the co. had accumulated
£1,859,154 in cash and readily realisable
securities. Since the business was likely to
need only a fraction of this, £1,500,000 of
the ord. capital was returned ; but the parent
voluntarily guaranteed the pref. capital as
well as the div. thereon, thus lifting the book
value of the net tangible cover to over £lO
per share. Further, the Australian co. waived
its rights in respect of the 224 P-c. statutory
cut in the pref. div., thus ensuring that 8 p.c.
instead of 6.2 p.c. is actually paid. The
8 p.c. was covered nearly 14 times by last
year’s net earnings in Australia, and over
13 times by the parent’s net earnings
(£1,172,568) for 1930.
Because of all this and the drop in interest
rates generally, the prefs. have advanced
from 245. 9d. to 31s. 3d. in the market over
the last 12 months or so. The return at
31s. 3d. is 5.1 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis.
Last year the co. handled a larger export
business, much of which was passed on from
the parent. But owing to the dulness locally,
and loss of interest on the capital returned,
there was a slip of £41,087 in the declared
net profit:—

Thus reductions* in allowances for deprecia-
tion and taxation left the amount for dis-
tribution only £16,087 lighter. It w r as
£1656 less than the pref. div. and 34 p.c.
to the ords. called for. However, open pro-
vision for contingencies does not appear to
be the only allowance the co. makes therefor.
Finances remain very snug, notwithstand-

•Subject to £BOO,OOO originally paid for goodwill.
Even the brewers haven’t been able to
sell as much as they used to; also the trade
has been subject to special taxation, and
there has been a sharp fall in the rental and
other value of pubs, some of which have been
thrown back on the hands of the companies.
The output of ale and stout for the Common-
wealth was 74,035,000 gallons, valued at
£7,900,000, in 1927-28; the figures had falleu
to 55,654,000 gallons and £5,792,000 for
1930-31, and were lower still last year.
After providing for contingencies, the
C.U.B.’s gross earnings for the 12 months
to June 30 (£311,815) fell away £24,086, of
which £14,128 was in respect of brewings
(£244.237), and £9958 on account of rentals,
etc. (£67,5781. The £244,237 is little more
than two-thirds of the 1925 figure, though
the co. had meanwhile bought the Melbourne
Co-operative, Fitzgerald’s (Castlemaine) and
Cohn’s (Bendigo). Exes. (£87,888, including
a special payment of £2500 to some of the
original vendors) were £7022 lighter, leaving
the net result at 11.4 p.c. on capital
(£1,950,000) as against 12.3, 17, 21.6, 22.8
and 22.5 p.c. back to 1927. The div., which
had been steady at 174 p.c. for the three
and a half years to the close of accounts in
1929, followed by 15 p.c. and then 114 P-c.,
dropped to 10 p.c.
There is nothing in sight at the moment
to suggest a further cut in the dividend.
Business generally has improved a trifle;
but it is mainly to growth in employment
that the breweries have to look for a worth-
while rise in beer consumption. Meanwhile,
the co. continues to tighten its grip on the
trade, and that should mean much when
better times come along.
The snug state of the finances and other
things are seen in the following table: —

East year’s reduction of £101,812 in debtors’
balances and of £32,198 in stocks, etc., to-
gether with surplus earnings and the allow-
ance for depreciation, etc., enabled cash and
investments to be strengthened by £184,118,
while £9540 was knocked off the outside
debt. Altogether, the more or less liquid
surplus (£1,350,258, including stocks) im-
proved £59,648. Over the last eight years
£487,326 net has been added to the book
value of hotel freeholds; this alone should
ensure a substantial turnover.

There is £358,111 of capital in 40,000 first,
108,111 second and 60,000 third prefs., and
150,000 ords. The prefs. are all 8 p.c.
cumulative, and advance with the ords.
beyond that rate, or beyond 6.2 p.c. while
the N. S. Wales Interest Reduction Act
remains in force. At Sept. 30 the lot, to-
gether with £76 coming to creditors and the
tax and other reserves, was represented by
shares in Australian Paper Manufacturers,
Ltd., and £19,993 of debtors’ balances, etc.
The manufacturing co. took over the Cum-
berland mills and the Australasian Paper
and Pulp Co.’s assets for scrip in 1926.
Later it struck 4s. per share (£320,000) off
its capital, reducing the figure to £1,280,000.
No adjustment in this respect has been
made in the Cumberland Co.’s books.
The destruction by fire of the Cumberland
mills affected the 1929 figures, and, until
last year, it had been a struggle to keep up
payments to the prefs. East year the ords.
as well as the prefs. got 7£ p.c., thanks to
the spring in the operating co.’s figures and
the statutory cut in the pref. rate, and pros-
pects are brighter than at any time since
the merger.
On the market the firsts are priced at 275.;
seconds, 265. 9d.; thirds, 255. 3d.; ords.’,
255. 6d. Allowing for the 10 p.c. deduction
by the co. on account of Federal super tax,
returns at these prices are 5 p.c., 5 p.c.,’
5.3 p.c. and 5.3 p.c. respectively. The net

Last year exchange and the tariff brought
much business formerly placed overseas this
co.’s way, keeping the mills fully employed,
and reducing costs, which were further
cut by improvements in manufacturing
methods. Hence the spring in earnings not-
withstanding reductions in selling prices.
More and more products are being packed
in cardboard and paper containers, and,
under existing conditions, further improve-
ment in earnings is anticipated. However
the declared policy is to pass on additional
gains to consumers, which makes a further
lift in the div. to the holding cos. doubtful.
The last final div., however, was at the rate
of 12f p.c. p.a., making 114 p.c. for the year,
and £2798 more than the declared profit was
distributed.
Payment of the insurance in ’29 and
special provision for depreciation have
brought about marked improvement in the

this stocks were reduced by £39,385, and
£25,832 was added to the amount coming to
sundry creditors. The improvement in the

This is the co. which amalgamated the busi-
nesses of Uptons, Ltd., M. O’Riordan and
Sons and the Alston Soap and Candle Co. as
from July 1, 1929. It paid £179,500 in ords.
for the assets of the three cos., including
£13,351 for goodwill, of which £lO,OOO was
taken by O’Riordan and Sons for “Early
Morn” soap. The public put up £40,000 in
8 p.c. cum. prefs.., which have priority as
to capital and dividends, making paid capi-
tal £179,509. John O’Riordan became chair-
man and managing director, and R. T. L.
Fenerty (of the Alston Co.) and R. C.
Weatherill (of Uptons) general manager
and works manager respectively.
The earnings of the three old cos. were
not disclosed, but this Australian Co. netted
£4718 more than the pref. div. and 5 p.c. to
the ords. called for in 1931. Last year’s gross
earnings (£62,992) slipped £10,425, due
partly to the expense of setting up a fac-
tory in Melbourne. Savings in exes.
(£59,678) reduced the net shrinkage to
£9091, leaving the profit £654 in excess of
the pref. div., which has been reduced to
6.65 p.c. under the N. S. Wales Interest Re-
duction Act. The general reserve at the pre-
vious balance (£10,282), together with
another £5991, has now been labelled depre-
ciation, tax, etc., reserve. Leaving this out
of the reckoning, £21,574 of the capital was
unrepresented by tangibles at the close of
last accounts.
There is nothing uncomfortable about the

The shrinkage of £9946 in debtors’ balances
suggests that trade was lighter. The growth
of £14,220 in the book value of stocks is
probably on account of the new Melbourne
factory, opened shortly before the close of
accounts. Only £BBB was added to the book
value of fixed assets; the necessary plant
was apparently transferred to Melbourne.
The more or less liquid surplus (£85,784,
including stocks) was £2571 lighter than at
the close of accounts in 1931.
On the market 15s. is asked for the prefs.
Allowing for the statutory cut the return
at that price is 8.8 p.c. The net tangible
cover is £4 18s. lid., excluding specific re-
serves. The ords. are not listed ; they are

This co. specialises in structural steel work
and tank- and boiler-making, and handles
a number of proprietary engineering and
hardware lines as well. Of its £104,135 of
capital the public is interested in £40,000 of
9 p.c. prefs., holders of wdiich agreed
to a reduction in the rate to 74 p.c. for five
years from the beginning of 1932. Before
the ords. can get a look in during this
period, the surrendered 14 p.c. is to be placed
to a special pref. div. reserve. Including
£3OO from last year’s earnings, this reserve
(£5300) was equal to over one and a half
year’s pref. divs. (at 74 p.c. p.a.) when the
books closed.
Considering the state of the trade gener-
ally, the co. has not fared badly. After pay-
ing the pref. div. the ords. got two lots of
5 p.c. each and one of 24 p.c. for the three
years to the close of accounts in 1931, thanks
largely to fabricating work in connection
with the new bridge over the Brisbane at
Gray-street, and McWhirter’s and the Public
Curator’s new buildings. East year the co.
got its full share of orders available,
but prices had to be cut, and many of the
machines worked less than half time. After
paying exes, and striking off £650 for doubt-
ful debts and depreciation of investments,
and after the Government and municipal
authorities together had taken an amount
equal to 5 p.c. on capital, there was enough
profit to pay the prefs. 84 p.c. and send £3OO
to the pref. div. reserve. There is no-
thing in sight at the moment on which to
base hopes for early returns to the ords.
Here is the position as balance-sheet
figures show it: —
1929. 1930. 1931. 1932.
Paid capital.. £104,135 £104,135 £104,135 £104,135

Cash, etc. .. 2,896 2,481 4,507 1,989
The more or less liquid surplus (£43.847,
including stocks) was £lll5 stronger than
at the close of accounts in 1931.
Investments include the co.’s holding in
W. S. Binnie and Sons, a subsidiary which
turns out railway waggons, etc. It regis-
tered a loss of £954 last year, reducing its
free reserve to £2509 at June 30 last. Paid
capital is £36,407. There was £5325 com-
ing to creditors; more or less liquids totalled
£4249; fixed assets, £41,264.
The parent’s prefs., which have a lien
on Binnie’s assets in respect of capital and
arrears of divs., are covered by £3 14s. in
net tangibles, mainly plant, etc., worth what
it can earn.

This co. took over John Broomfield’s ship-
chandlery business in 1917; hardware was
added later. The war years were rich ones
for the trade, and in 1920 £31,500 of
bonus scrip was scattered. The story
since has been one of persistently con-
tracting turnover and receding values,
which, of course, has meant trouble with
stocks and debtors’ balances. In an effort
to make book values represent more truly
the actual state of affairs, two cuts of ss.
per share each were made in capital. Never-
theless, for the nine years to the close of
accounts in 1929, shareholders averaged only
2$ p.c. They have gone hungry since, and
losses had swallowed all but £2975 of the
reserves when the books last closed.
Gross earnings, which came down by
annual steps from £39,428 in 1927 to £19,560
in 1931, were £21,396 last year. Exes.
(£23,099) were £1783 lighter, due mainly to
smaller provision for bad debts, etc., leav-
ing the loss at £1703, or £3619 less than the
previous year’s. It is the most hopeful move-
ment in the figures over the last seven years.
Still, the hardware trade generally remains
dull, and does not look like regaining very
much of its former activity for some time.
On the other hand the liquidation of Keep-
Macpherson and others in the trade has
lessened competition.
The year’s reduction of £BO3l in the
book value of stocks was accompanied by a
growth of £2921 in debtors’ balances and a
contraction of £3642 in the amount coming
to sundry creditors :
1922. 1929. 1931. 1932.
Paid capital.. £169,230 £85,108 £85,152 £85,152

Book debts .. 42,872 33,212 18,776 21,697
Cash . . . . 118 ' 224 156 180
Thus the more or less liquid surplus (£44,580,
including stocks) was £1444 lighter than at
the previous balance.
The market prices the fully-paid pound
shares at 3s. 6d. The net tangible cover is
20s. Bd. (book value).

This is the co. which took over the Hamp-
ton Court Flats, Darlinghurst, in 1920.
Fashionable apartments, handy to the city,
continued to fetch exceptional rentals, and
the ords. enjoyed a run of 10 p.c. divs. to
the close of accounts in 1927. Meanwhile,
half the premises had been rebuilt, and
modernising improvements were made to the
other half, the co. going substantially into
debt, as well as gathering £30,000 of 9 p.c.
pref. capital, for the purpose. The high ren-
tals, mainly the result of artificial prosper-
ity, resulted in a rush to get into the busi-
ness, and flat owners vied with each other
in the embellishments they offered.
Rentals fell, of course, and slump greatly
hastened the process. The co.’s gross
earnings have come down by annual
steps from £31,487 in 1927 to £15,844
last year, when the slip was £361; rents had
to be further reduced to attract tenants.
Still, takings for the last half of the term
were 25 p.c. better than for the first half;
and the building is now reported fully let.
The improvement of £2933 in the net result
was due to the absence of any visible allow-
ance for depreciation—£3ooo of the previous
year’s takings were so set aside. Moreover,
the accumulated provision for depreciation
(£25,083 at June 30, 1931) has been labelled
general reserve, raising the lay-by to £31.953
when the books last closed. The “Wild. Cat”
won’t swear, therefore, that either this re-
serve or the £4414 of profit claimed last
year are 100 p.c. genuine; much depends
upon what amount, if any, was spent on
repairs and renewals and charged to work-
ing exes. In this class of business, furnish-
ing, equipment, etc., depreciate rapidly.
The position as balance-sheet figures show
it is as follows: —
1926. 1930. 1931. 1932.

What of a dowry for your daughter
when she marries?
FAR too few people seem to know that the A.M.P. has a plan
for providing dowries for daughters. Far too few; yet
there are some parents who have takejn the easy A.M.P.
way of making married life easier and safer for their girls an
the years to come.
Take the daughter of the couple here pictured. She is 10 years
old. For a premium of £5/9/9 a quarter her father (who is 35
years old) can provide her with a dowry of £3OO (plus bonuses),
payable when she is 25 (i.e., in 14 years 5 time). Should he die
in the meantime, the “dowry” will be paid at once.
Wouldn’t it give you peace of mind to know that you had made
this provision for youv girl? Wouldn’t it be a good plan for
you to find out the several ways in which you can assure your
daughter’s financial safety? We shall gladly send an officer
(or a letter and booklets) to explain the merits of the several
different plans we have.
A note to the nearest A.M.P. office will bring all information.

When the board is able to see more defi-
nitely where the business stands a cut will
be made in capital (now £120,000) ; not
much notice, therefore, need be taken of the
so-called reserves in the table or of the
book value of some of the assets. Since
the public became interested in 1925, share-
holders parted up an extra £45,000, and a
blister of £40,000 was put on the premises.
The new money w*as used mainly to buy
scrip in Checker Cabs (now in liquidation)
and for the purchase of Day’s Motor Tourist
Service, Ltd. For the three years to the
close of accounts in 1929, two divs. of 8 p.c.
and one of 4 p.c. were paid, though, accord-
ing to the figures, reserves had to be tapped
for £3783 to do it.
Then Day’s failed to contribute to the
pool, leaving the co. dependent upon rentals
from its four-storeyed freehold in Phillip-
street, and whatever its own garage and
car-hire business could earn. Thus a loss
of £921 in 1931 was followed by a profit of
only £572 last year.
Prospects of an early revival of earnings
depend largely upon what happens in con-
nection with Day’s, which has been severely
hit by the Transport Act, and the co.’s own
car-liire business. Interest on the mortgage
has been reduced, but the gain there appears
to have been more than offset by the statu-
tory and other cuts in rentals.
Here is as much as balance-sheet figures
tell: —

The position is somewhat obscured by the
lumping of debtors’ balances with shares, etc.
But most of the £96,475 at which the item
appears represents the co.’s interest in Day’s
and Checker Cabs —it is doubtful whether
there will be much, if anything, for share-
holders from the Checker liquidation.
The Msayiland Government’s Unemploy-
ment Board "is assisting some 2000 men in
prospecting for gold and other minerals, and
it aims to double this number by the end of
the summer. Attention is to be turned to
the Thames and Coromandel areas, near
Auckland. Here tracks are to be cut through
the bush to give access to likely deposits in
the hills, where about 200 men have been
fossicking, and encouraging results have
been obtained. A lot of gold-bearing ore is
known to exist in the Coromandel ranges.
With the increase in the value' of the metal
and the drop in wages, much of this ore is
likely to be worth crushing. A portable bat-
tery, designed for testing reefs in isolated
places, and capable of crushing two tons of
quartz in eight hours, is to be tried out at
Coromandel.
* * * *
Messrs. Cutlack and Baker have pegged
100 acres of reef country in Papua for the
North East New Guinea Co., a holding and
prospecting concern which has already tested
several propositions without success. Values
of from loz. to 7oz. per ton are now spoken
of. After locating this new reef, the party
crossed a watershed to an alluvial valley,
where dish prospects showed from 15s. to
20s. per c.y., the content being gold and
platinum. Here the co. has taken an option
over 300 acres. More ground is available,
and another party will visit the country
next month to examine the whole field.
* * * *
Great Northern, operating in the .uc-
Douall Ranges, about six miles south of Ten-
nant’s Creek, Centralia, has sunk a shaft
40ft. in rich ore. The outcrop strikes west
and is conspicuous for a length of 400 ft.
The lode, which’ dips sharply to the south,
is enclosed by schists and quartzites. In
addition to gold, the ore carries from
5 p.c. to 13 p.c. of bismuth. The find is on
high ground, which ought to mean cheap
haulage and drainage; but it is a long way
from the coast.
* * * *
Granites Gold has taken a working option
over part of the Monte Cristo line at Avoca
(Vic.). The lode is reported to be 3ft.
wide, assaying 12^dwt.; but a lot of work
needs to be done yet before a reliable idea
can be formed about the value of the pro-
perty. The co. also has a lease of 75 acres
to the north.
* * * *
During 1932 the nine Government bat-
teries in the Ballarat district (Vic.)
crushed 6581 tons for 28540 z., equal to
per ton. The richest parcel was put
thx-ough at Egerton—37o tons for 4060 z.
* # *
Gold Mines Development, which is open-
ing up the Yankee at Trentham (Vic.), has
cleaned up 730 z. of fine gold from 185 tons,
an average of Bdwt. per ton. On the 130 ft.
and 230 ft. levels, the stone varies from Ift.
to Bft. in width.
# - * * *
At Wiluna four lodes have been located thus
far in a mineralised ore-channel 850 ft. wide
and at least two miles long. The West and
East lodes have been opened up down to the
800 ft. level. Also, the continuation of the East
lode was recently proved at 3500 ft. north
of the main shaft, where the ore body was
52ft. wide, and assayed 40s. per ton. The No.
2 West lode, which gave no surface indication
at all, is unpayable in the oxidised zone
above 300 ft. This lode, which has a
length of 4000 ft., is now being tested by
crosscuts on the 450 ft. and 800 ft. levels. The
co. proposes to develop the fourth lode, the
Far East, which lies 150 ft. east of the East
lode, during the current year. Last year
the co.’s ore reserves increased at the rate
of 60,000 tons monthly; many hope for a
greater rate of increase during 1933. Present
reserves (1,500,000 tons) are equal to over
three years’ supply at 40,000 tons monthly.
* * * *
North Ivalgurli (W.A.) has struck two
rich patches of telluride ore, each assaying
over loz. per ton; one is in a stope above
the 366 ft. level, and the other in a north
drive on the 830 ft. level. Calaverite, the
most common of the ten tellurides found at
Kalgoorlie, contains from 34 p.c. to 42 p.c.
metallic gold. AH varieties are very rich.
Of the gold now being won at Kalgoorlie
only about 35 p.c. occurs as coarse free
metal; tellurides and sulphides, both amen-
able to flotation, account for the balance.
$ ❖ * ❖
Surprising the gold that was left in Kal-
goorlie tailings. One dump now being treated
by Lake View and Star assays 245. a ton.
On some of the other mines large piles of
residues have been retreated again and again,
and are still declared to be valuable. In fact,
one is reckoned to contain “hundreds of thou-
sands of pounds clear profit.”
% # ❖
Westralian Government batteries, regarded
by outback prospectors and leaseholders as
a boon and a blessing, are now extracting
about £30,000 worth of gold a month, and
for the first time they have become a source
of profit to the State. There are 25 of them
in operation, the most isolated being at Jumble
Bar, 300 miles north of Meekathafra. The
value of gold won to date by these batteries
exceeds £6,750,000.
H: * ❖ H*
Owing to the fortnight’s stoppage which
the unions insist upon at Christmas, Lake
View and Star’s mill has had to treat low-
grade ore lying in the stopes, while Great
Boulder and South Kalgurli handled reduced
tonnages. Earnings have suffered in all
cases, of course.
* * * *
Good goldmines remain hard to find.
A. J. Macgeorge, consulting engineer of W.A.
Gold Explorations, recently inspected 104
propositions scattered throughout Westralia.
Of these no more than eleven justified
sampling, and only one has prospects that
warrant the formation of a co.

Rawang Concessions (paid capital,
£200,000) netted £23,509 for the year to'
May 31 last as against £16,344 for the year
before. Three 6d. divs. took £15,000. The
dredge recovered 533 tons of ore from
1,152,000 c.y., an average of 1.071 b. to the
yard. Costs were 3.16 d. as against 2.93 d.
for the previous year, when the ground
averaged .791 b. per yard. The dredge worked
12 hours daily until August, when it was
restricted to eight hours to comply with
quota arrangements. The ore averaged
£123 per ton, London. Until June, 1933,
the co.’s output will be restricted to 25 p.c.
of normal.
* * * *
Kampong Lanjut (paid capital, £300,000)
cleared £7461 for the year to June 30, 1932,
as against £14,515 for the previous term.
A 6d. div. (the first) absorbed £7500, and
£14,646 is carried forward. Both the co.’s
dredges worked full time until the end of
August, when the ' restriction cut was in-
creased to 60 p.c., and then to 75 p.c. till
June next. Hence No. 1 dredge has closed
down. During the greater part of the year
the co. produced only 40 p.c. of its normal
output. Taxation (£5766) amounted to
almost 42 p.c. of the working profit. The
dredges, which stand in the books at about
two-thirds of their replacement value, treated
3.500,000 c.y. for 562 tons black tin, equal to
,361 b. per yard. Working costs were T.99d.
No provision was made for amortisation or
depreciation.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Any information about the Australian
Graziers’ Meat Co.? —3730.
The co. came on the market early in
1929 with a nominal capital of £1,500,000
in £1 shares, of which a million were
offered. The declared aim was to
■ establish slaughtering and chilling works
and put up dry-rendering plants in selected
country centres in N. S. Wales, and to trade
as wholesale suppliers of meat and ex-
porters to the world’s markets, etc. No
estimate of capital outlay or anticipated
trading results was given. Actually, the
prospectus amounted to nothing more than
a statement that a co. with objects as set
out could be successful. At Sept. 30 last
89,352 shares had been issued and called to
4s. each. Including £lO7 of calls paid in
advance, £14,194 had been gathered—there
was £3789 calls unpaid—and sundry credi-
tors figured for £1057. All but £390 of the
lot had been swallowed in formation and

to the prospectus no promoters’ considera-

holders are liable for a further £75,258, if

of good business for shareholders if the co.

BRIEF ANSWERS.
W.T.R.: They are a promising lot; Wiluna or
Lake View for preference. Much, of course, depends
upon exchange movements, which largely determine
the paper price of g01d.... Gold: Everything would
then depend upon trade balances ; the price of gold
could be expected to ease... .H.N.D.: If you pay
the call (Is.), and can then sell the shares for
anything in excess of Is., you will lose less than
by forfeiting the scrip now. Indeed, forfeiture
would not at once relieve you of legal liability in
the matter. On paper the net tangible backing was
19s. 9d. per pound of paid capital at June 30 last.
The scrip is not listed; ask the secretary if he can
find a buyer for y0u.... H. 11.: The forestry ventures
are long-term speculations; prospects for the salt
venture are far from rosy. ... Y.K.C.: The co. does
not broadcast its sheet. Ask the secretary for infor-
mation required. .. .F. 8.: Cannot say... .W.S.A.:

to subscribe for shares■ The whole of the contributing capital has been
subscribed by London and Australian interests.)
Western Gold Mines
No Liability
(Registered under Part 2 of the Companies Act 1928 of Victoria.)
NOMINAL CAPITAL:
£50,000 in 100,000 shares of 10/- each.
80,000 shares have been subscribed at 1/- per share application
and allotment money;
20,000 shares are being issued fully paid to the vendors of the
option mentioned below.
The objects of the Company are to acquire, inter alia, all the assets
of The Occidental Development Syndicate, Limited, of Perth, W.A. (other
than its uncalled capital, moneys in hand or at bankers, and office equip-
ment). The assets purchased include an option over Reidy’s Mararoa mining
properties, with leases and reserved areas of over 800 acres, situated near the
Cue-Meekatharra railway, Western Australia. The Company has full power
to prospect, test, acquire, develop, equip and work other mining properties.
The sum of £l5OO is being paid in cash to Metals Investigation Pty., Ltd.,
in reimbursement of its expenses in connection with the purchase of the
Mararoa option.
The price payable for the assets of The Occidental Syndicate is the sum
of £lO,OOO cash and 20,000 fully-paid shares in Western Gold Mines ,No
Liability. These purchased assets include the option to acquire the Mararoa
property for £50,000 cash or, alternatively, 25 p.c. of the share capital of
a company with not less than £75,000 working capital.
Exercise of the option would also render Western Gold Mines No
Liability responsible for payment out of profits of the sum of £2988/6/7,
due to the West Australian Government in respect of earlier boring. The
option provides, further, for the holders continuing development work during
its currency.
Messrs. Richard Hamilton (Director of and late General Manager of
the Great Boulder Proprietary Gold Mines, Limited) and H. E. Vail (the
well-known mining engineer of Director of Wiluna Gold Mines, Ltd.,
and Consulting Engineer to Lake View and Star, Ltd.), both of whom were
and still are interested in The Occidental Syndicate, and both of whom have
since joined the Board of Western Gold Mines No Liability, reported on the
30th December, 1932, as follows:
"We are disregarding our personal interests and professionally
advise as follows: The Development Company (Occidental Syndicate)
offered to you is established and a going concern of good prospective
value. This Company’s assets include an option on a property (Reidy’s
Mararoa) which has produced a considerable tonnage of over half-ounce
ore. The bores put down by the Government prove the persistence of
the lode at depth in both width and value. A recent bore by The
Occidental Company proved a further extension in length with average
width and value maintained. We consider the boring programme being
carried out for proving the extension of the lode both in length and
depth distinctly favorable. The next bore will reach the lode early next
month; ,if, as is expecte_d, this discloses lode of average width and value
of other bores this shoot will be extended to total of eight hundred feet.
Geological conditions are very favorable for lode living to at at least
1000 feet in depth; if so, and it averaged 10 feet in width and half-
ounce in gold per ton, at present price for gold profit's from ore
developed would approximate one million pounds over development,
equipment and operating costs. The strong shearing in evidence provides
favorable conditions for the occurrence of parallel ore bodies."
Since the negotiations for the acquisition of the option were commenced
two bores have intersected the lode, proving so far its extension to a length of
800 feet. These bores were put down to proye the lateral extension of the
ore body which had been opened up by previous development over a length
of 400 to 500 feet. The bores were laid out to cut the lode between 250 feet
and 300 feet vertical depth. The first bore cut 10 feet of ore worth approxi-
mately 1 ldwts., and the second bore 13 feet of ore worth approximately
Bdwts. Diamond drilling is being continued.
Mr. Richard Hamilton, writing on sth January last, after stating that
it was reasonable to expect a shoot of ore 800 feet long by 1000 feet in
depth, 10 feet in thickness and averaging lOdwts., which, valuing gold at
7/- per dwt. with costs of 20/- per ton, would give easily a surplus of
£1,000,000 after fully equipping the mine and developing it to the depth
stated, added:—
“There is a very long shear plane in the property extending for
more than a mile north of where the boring has been done, and this
must be tested by diamond drilling. The speculative value of this portion
of the property is very difficult to appraise.
"With a shear plane so long one expects supplementary parallel
and counter shears. The main shear is capped with laterite, with some
haematite in places, and the ground on the east and west side of the
main shear is covered with red soil, making it very difficult to recognise
either parallel or counter shears. Reliance must be placed upon the
drill to find them. Richer ore is commonly found where the counter
shears strike the main shear, and when it is at least a mile in length
there is an excellent chance of finding several counter shears.
"Half-ounce ore in large quantity, under ordinary circumstances,
and at 85/- per ounce, is very profitable, and as all the ore discovered in
the mine to date is over half-ounce value the venture has a very good
foundation, and I have a strong belief that it will be very successful.

ISHMAEL—
Or the Future of the Australian Drama.
A Dialogue.
Scene: Editorial sanctum of" a weekly
newspaper in Melbourne. Persons: His-
trion, a writer, producer and actor in
amateur drama; Criticaster, a dramatic
critic in a bad way for something to write
about, the city being infested with the refuse
of the Christmas season, namely, panto-
mimes. Time: Middle of a heat wave.
Hail, O Histrion ! How goes it with your
learned profession?
It goes well, O Criticaster. The people,
as you know, are deeply interested in the
IVAN MENZIES as the Major-General in
“The Pirates.”
theatre. It is a part of their life which
they cannot do without.
Then, O Histrion, your Australian theatre
must be well attended?
On the contrary, alas, O Criticaster! If
we can get a poor hundred people and but
two critics to attend a performance, how-
ever meritorious, we consider ourselves as
most fortunate. However, we have con-
ceived a method for altering that.
What do you propose to do, Histrion?
We proposed to obtain a device known as
a prohibitive tariff against imported plays
and foreign actors, for imported plays can-
not hold a mirror up to our national life,
and foreign actors cannot reflect the in-
numerable facets of our national character.
And as the Australian people are intensely
patriotic and believe in their own country,
they naturally must want to see the mirror
of the stage held up to our national life
and character. That mirror can be held
up only by Australian writers.
Good. But what, might I ask, is the pro-
cess by which the Australian writer achieves
his creations?
By inspiration, Criticaster. There is no
other method.
By inspiration, Histrion, you mean, I pre-
sume, something outside yourself, not some-
thing you have yourself seen or experienced?
Exactly, Criticaster. : Otherwise every-
body would be able to write drama, which
is ridiculous.
Whence comes thisinspiration, Histrion?
I do not know,. Criticaster. When one
sits down before a virgin sheet of paper it
simply coines, and one writes as it dictates.
For w r ant of a better name we writers call
it being possessed by the Muses.
Then it is these Muses, and not you, who
know what you should write?
I suppose so, Criticaster.
Suppose, Histrion, a French author were
to write a play about Australia and were
to put into the mouth of a Mallee farmer
words that no Mallee farmer would use in
CLIFF COWLEY as the Pirate Lieutenant
in “The Pirates.”
that particular connection, you would know
that the author was not possessed by the
Muses?
I would, Criticaster.
Even if you had never heard a Mallee
farmer talk on that particular .subject?
I suppose so, Criticaster.
In that case, it would not be because you
had had direct experience of the Mallee
farmer that you knew the French writer
was wrong, but because your Muses told
you so?
I suppose so, Criticaster.
Then, if a French writer were inspired by
the Muses, he would be' able to write about
a Mallee farmer just as well as an Aus-
tralian who had talked to a Mallee farmer,
and better than an Australian who had never
seen a Mallee farmer?
It would seem so, from the way you put
it, Criticaster.
So an Australian who had never seen a
Mallee farmer might write nonsense about
him, while a Frenchman might write reason-
ably about him, because the Frenchman was
possessed by the Muses?
That appears to follow, Criticaster.
So that if you had your protective tariff
against French writers there would be
danger of shutting out a writer who knew
more about an Australian theme than an
Australian, because he was possessed by the
Muses, whereas the Australian was not?
At .the present moment I can see no flaw
in your argument. Criticaster.
Perhaps, Histrion, the flaw lies in the
original proposition. As you remember, you
said that the writer creates, not as a result
of direct experience, but through being pos-
sessed by the Muses, did you not?
One or other of us said something like
that. Criticaster.
It was you, Histrion. And later you said
that the inspiration of the Muses could only
be judged in the final result by direct ex-
perience.
Did I say that, Criticaster?
You did, Histrion. So that the only con-
clusion we can now come to is that either
the Muses have direct experience themselves
or that the writer writes, from direct experi-
ence, and only thinks that the Muses inspire
him. Is that not so?
It seems so, Criticaster.
And you do . not know which alternative is
correct, Histrion?
I can come to no immediate decision.
Let us, Histrion, return to somewhere
near our starting point. You spoke of a pro-
tective tariff for Australian writers similar
to those for sugar-growers, manufacturers
of strippers and binders and dried-fruit
growers ?
Yes, Criticaster.
Why is a manufacturer of strippers and
binders entitled to protection, Histrion?
Because he knows how to manufacture
strippers and binders just as well as any
foreigner, and would make just as good
strippers and binders if he were given the
opportunity.
Then should not a manufacturer of Aus-
tralian plays be , in the same position?
Certainly, Criticaster.
But how, Histrion, is he to know how to
manufacture Australian plays if he does
not know whether he works from direct
JOHN RALSTON as the Sergeant in
“The Pirates.”
experience or through possession by the
Muses'?. • '
I do not know how to answer your ques-
tion, O Criticaster. There must be a fal-
lacy in it somewhere.
There is a fallacy in it, Histrion. It
lies in your assumption that there is .such
a thing as Australian drama. There isn’t
any.
Oh!
Moreover, I hope there never will be,
Histrion.
That sounds rather unpatriotic.
On the contrary, I believe it to be the
highest form of patriotism. Are you a
painter, Histrion?
No, Criticaster.
Still, that should be no drawback to a
discussion on painting. You said 'just now
that direct experience was unnecessary, since
knowledge comes from inspiration. What
would you define as an Australian painting?
A painting of something in Australia,
Criticaster.-
Would this something. Australian have to
be painted by an'Australian painter?
I suppose so, Criticaster.
Then, Histrion, an Englishman, painting
gum-trees would not be painting an Aus-
tralian picture.
Evidently.
Would an Australian painting an English
elm be painting an Australian picture?
Evidently not, Criticaster.
What would he be painting, Histrion ?
I suppose he would be painting nature.
You are right, Histrion. He would be
painting nature. And, I presume, an Eng-
lishman painting gum-trees would also be
painting nature, Histrion?
I suppose so. But what does this lead
us to?
I am coming to that. How do you define
Australian drama, Histrion?
Well, obviously, an Australian drama
would be a drama about Australia.
Then “Othello” would be a Venetian
drama and “Measure for Measure” a Vien-
nese drama and “Antony and Cleopatra” an
Egyptian drama and “Saint Joan” a French
drama?
That, O Criticaster, is ridiculous. They
are English dramas set in those places and
written by an Englishman and an Irish-
man.
Then, Histrion, in what would the Eng-
lishness of “Measure for Measure” consist,
for instance?
Well, I don’t know exactly, now I come to
think of it. The characters use English.
BERNARD MANNING as the Pirate King
in “The Pirates.”
Well, now, Histrion, what is the most im-
portant feature of that play which strikes
you with such inevitable force that you are
unconscious of the fact that English is being
spoken ?
The nature of Angelo, which drives him
to the most horrible excesses in the guise of
moral indignation.
You have spoken with great insight, 0
Histrion. You mean, in short, that, just
as a painting may be a study of inorganic
nature, so “Measure for Measure” is a study
of human nature, which is universal?
That is my thought exactly, Criticaster.
Then an Australian drama, if it aspires
to be as great as “Measure for Measure” —
and no meaner aim, surely, can be the object
of the Australian writer, however lowly—
should deal with the same subject?
Most certainly, Criticaster.
I am glad that we are in such complete
agreement on this point. Histrion. For now
I see that, whether you believe that you are
inspired by the Muses or write from direct
experience, you at least will not need the
protection of a prohibitive tariff in order
to write plays as great as Shakspeare’s, since
there is just as much human nature
at your disposal as there is at the dis-
posal of an Englishman or a Frenchman.
So the goodness or badness of your plays
will depend on what you have understood
of human nature, or, if you like to put it
in your own way, on the quality of your
inspiration. Of course, the people may
prefer watching Bradman to listening to
your plays, in which case it may be neces-
sary to get the Board of Control to suppress
Bradman.
Though qualified as a barrister of the
Inner Temple, W. S. Gilbert had no very
extensive experience of the practice of law,
and in “Trial by Jury” he burlesques the
procedure without any regard whatever for
the verities. The one-act operetta, scored
by Sullivan in the days when he still lived
in an atmosphere ,of organs and anthems
and hadn’t begun to realise that his diva-
gations into jollity were his best means of
expression, was revived by the Firm at
Sydney Royal on Saturday night as a pre-
lude to “The Pirates of Penzance.” The
legal extravaganza doesn’t wear as well as
its Savoyard associate. Dickens, who got
his knowledge of courts as a reporter, ex-
ploited the field very much more effectively
in his account of Bardell v. Pickwick. As
to “The Pirates,” Gilbert’s recipe for accen-
tuating the time-honored sentiments of melo-
drama and Sullivan’s recipe for imitating
grand opera were never more delightfully
applied. “Poor Wandering One” wouldn’t

seem out of place if it were planked into
the middle of “Trovatore” or “Lucia.” Both
pieces were given the same casting as at
the last previous - Sydney : performances, less
than 18. months ago, and save that the chorus
is enunciating more clearly—or perhaps it
only appears to be, because the listeners
know the words by heart—there is no altera-
tion in the very acceptable presentation given
of each.

The pantomime has departed from Sydney
Grand Opera House and in its place capers

pub, in which Jim Gerald has a job. Besides
his prowess at repartee Jim makes a hit with
his warbling, liis rendering of “I Never See
Maggie Alone” bringing the house down. The
guests are also a lively bunch of enter-
tainers. Frieda Bonning and Will Perryman
pair well in songs, Heather - Jones, Lily
Coburn, Vilma Ivaye, Reg. Hawthorne and
Tom Dale give a good account of them-
selves, and the “Twelve Twinkling Twink-
lers” are, all that one expects from a ballet.

Leahy were slightly better than the rest.
Shadow Shows.
Every fresh Sherlock Holmes film presents
a detective who, is less like Conan Doyle’s
famous creation. The latest (“Sherlock
Holmes” by name), at Sydney Regent, is
simply an American gangster. It begins
with Ernest Torrence, as Moriarty, being
sentenced to death at the Old Bailey. He
tells the Judge that the rope that will hang
him hasn’t been made, and is next shown at
large and in pursuit of Holmes. Clive Brook,
as Holmes, disguises himself as a \Voman,
and deceives his old enemy, but he didn’t
deceive the hilarious Regent audience for a
second on Saturday night. Moriarty, tricked
into believing that Holmes is safely in gaol
on a charge of murder, tries to break into a
bank, and his undoing follows amid showers
of bullets. The professor, in the hands of
Torrence behaves with singular brainless-
ness, and, what is worse, he looks brainless.
Jimmy Atholwood played the most terrify-
ing Moriarty this Showman ever saw; Tor-
rence’s is easily the least impressive. To
compare Brook’s Holmes to that of Gillette
or even of Arthur Wontner is like compar-
ing a Clydesdale to Phar Lap. Casting apart,
the film is a remarkably feeble effort. That
brilliant little English comedian Herbert
Mundin has been snapped up by Fox, so an
act has'been pitchforked in for him. He
plays a Cockney barman who is offered “pro-
tection” at £1 a week by a Chicago racketeer,
refuses and has his establishment bombed.
Funny enough, of course, but as irrelevant
as the hunting scene (with hounds running
through a midsummer landscape) which pre-
cedes it. Miriam Jordan, as Brook’s fiancee,
supplies the osculation interest.
In “Big City Blues” Eric Linden, as a
small-town lad with an infinite capacity for
registering open-mouthed, wide-eyed inanity,
inherits 1100 dollars, departs with the
money for New York, and is picked up there
by a cousin who has taken as his model the
cigar-smoking, wise-cracking member of the
Wheeler and Woolsey team! The film dates.
The swinish eagerness shown by all hands
to get at the drinks indicates that it was
made when prohibition was still a political
force in the U.S.A. Eric gets mixed up in a
drunken brawl which ends in a lady of
the ensemble (Ang. chorus girl) getting
killed by a blow on the head with a bottle.
He returns, minus his 1100 dollars, a
sadder though no less imbecile lad. He
has met Joan Blondell during his revels.
As his train steams out she is seen yearning
tearfully after him through the bars of a
railway station, and we realise that a Great
Happiness awaits them. Guy Kibbee is
amusing as a house detective. The Tom
Katz Band is a fine supporting item.

Ewing Scott, who journeyed to Point
Barrow, Alaska, to shoot scenes of Eskimo
life, is the person responsible for “Igloo”
at Sydney Lyceum. -Had he been content
to produce a travelogue and omitted to add
a drama of “hot hearts amid the frozen
packs” his show would have been more
acceptable. There is probably no race less
suited to portray Hollywooden emotion than
the glum-faced Eskimos. To make it worse,
their outbursts of passion are conveyed to
the audience per medium of a canned an-
nouncer. But the trek across the snow-
swept waste in search of the open sea is a
moving sight, and so is the storm which
whirls through the small village of ice igloos
in the early scenes. Zane Grey’s “Heri-
tage of the Desert,” a hard-riding, hard-
fighting Western, is the support.
* * *
A. A. Milne’s “Michael and Mary,” at
Sydney Mayfair, is charming. Mary’s
worthless husband has bolted to South
Africa. Michael befriends her, and so loses
his fiancee. They lodge in the same home
in all innocence, and puritanical neighbors
disapprove. So they commit bigamy.
Michael becomes a successful author, and
their son gets his blue and a nice girl.
Enter the missing husband with talk ot
blackmail! But all ends happily, and Her-
bert Marshall, Edna Best, D. A Clarkc-
Smith Ben Field and Margaret Yarde do the
thing capitally. The camera work is well
up to the Hollywood standard, and the atmo-
sphere of London in the late nineties is
recaptured with success.
* * *
In “Hidden Gold,” at Sydney H'aymarket,
Tom Mix is foreman of the Bar M ranch.
He leaves the ranch, and takes a job as a
police “stool" to try to find where the
stolen money is hidden, is put in prison
with the gang, helps them to escape, recovers
the money and leads the pretty owner of the
ranch, Judith Barrie, to the altar. All this
to the accompaniment of the usual gallop-
ing and gun-play. Raymond Hatton, as
Spike one-time boxer and member of the
o- an ,r ’takes most of the honors.
& “The Last Ride” is another newspaper-v.-
racketeer show. Charles Morton is the young
reporter, Frank Mayo is the gangster who put
Morton’s brother on the spot, and Virginia
Brown Faire the girl who helps Charles to
down Mavo Francis Ford is the police ser-
o-eant who holds the gun in the right direc-
tion at the end. Nobody stands out. Just
an f.a.q. gangster.


BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
A Contra Account Against Uncle Sam
Since the U.S.A. have taken up their un-
compromising attitude in regard to the pay-
ment of war debts, many people have been
wondering why the representatives of the
British bondholders who long ago advanced
to. several of the American States cash which
has never been repaid do not again press
their claim. Every few years, in order to
maintain their rights, the representatives of
the original lenders file a formal claim for
this money, but that is as far as it goes.
The history of the loans is interesting.
After the Civil War in America some of the
impoverished Confederate States borrowed
money from England for reconstruction pur-
poses. These were Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and
North and South Carolina. These States
were then again under Federal control, gov-
erned by Federal officials and with Federal
legislation taking the place of much of their
own State law. Hence the British bond-
holders could hardly be blamed for imagin-
ing they had the backing of the American
Federal Government.
None of the States concerned made the
slightest effort to repay principal or remit
interest, and there the matter stands to-day.
The bondholders applied to the paramount
authority, the Federal Government. Although
the latter was in control of the borrowing
States when the loans were made, the
authorities at Washington announced that
the financial affairs of the States of the
Union were no concern of theirs.
The amount now owing by the repudiating
States,, plus interest, is £350,000,000 at par.
Tke Northern Territory
“Wai-hoi”: Yet another Ministerial visit
to the Northern Territory is mooted; later
in the year Perkins will listen to tales of
woe from pastoralist, agricultural settler,
miner, business man and white-coated offi-
cial. The same reams of notes will be taken
down, and over the rim of a champagne
glass in the Darwin Town Hall the usual
Ministerial promises for the rectification of
grievances will be made; then the usual re-
port will be sent, to .Cabinet confreres, and
the total result, if things run true to form,
will be nothing. Officialdom always has been
the curse of the tropical North, excepting
for a few patches under the South Aus-
tralian regime between the ’sixties and 1911,
when the . Commonwealth took over the
country, gave Sammy Mitchell the sack and
put Jock Gilruth' into Government House at
Darwin.
Every northerner sees in the proposed
Birdum-Darwin railway scheme the possi-
bility of private enterprise being allowed to
do something, for a change. Territorians
aren’t much worried as to whether the
vested interests of South Aus. or Queensland
win the day as long as they get a railway
to the settled areas of the South. The real
Territorian, whether he runs cattle, or tries
to make a do of mining, or grows peanuts,
has the heart of a lion to be able still to
smile. What a scream there is in the city
if a letter misses the first delivery; but
what about Daly River settlers who watched
their whole season’s crop of peanuts stacked
on the river bank gradually destroyed whilst
it awaited a Government river-steamer that
never came? They’re a large-hearted, long-
suffering crowd in the Territory, and as an
old outbacker I fancy much real good to
Australia would be the result if every en-
deavor were made to hurry improved trans-
port facilities in the Far North, such as the
proposed railway would give.
Postal Services
Dear B., —The recently introduced system
of closing down the post office at Christmas
so far as Brisbane is concerned is a most
impudent piece of inefficiency. In this city
there were no outward mails of any descrip-
tion between 9 p.m. Saturday and Tuesday
morning. The Sydney air mail which left
Monday morning closed Saturday, 9 p.m.
The English mail was not sorted into the
boxes until Tuesday morning, although the
outward mail to England closed at 8.45 a.m.
on Tuesday, so it was impossible to reply to
English correspondents of the same week.
If there was a strike of postal workers our
press w T ould call a three-day stoppage “the
paralysation of industry,” “a national calam-
ity,” and all the rest of it; but because the
post office sanctions this three-day hold-up
nothing is said. It does not even save money,
as I am informed that the men are not paid
overtime for working on holidays, but are
allowed time off.
Perhaps next year the idea may be ex-
tended and the fire brigade and police given
a three-day holiday.—Yours etc., D. L. (Q.).
Exchange and Exports
“Beta”: Railway sleepers are worth 4
rupees 12 annas (6s. 4d.) c.i.f. and e.
Calcutta. The price here is approximately
the same f.o.b. Sydney, leaving the advan-
tage in exchange to offset freight, insur-
ance, etc. Big business is on the border line
of feasibility—but only with the help of
the exchange. Sleepers take a fair time to
cut and accumulate, and to quote now, de-
pending on the exchange to make not only
the profit but part of the actual cost, could
easily mean financial disaster. The exchange
rate naturally appeals to the man with
exportable goods on spot, but is no incen-
tive to the canny producer, industrial or
rural, who has to lay the foundation now
of contracts he might not deliver for
months.
“Mirrool”: Some of the big ’buses that
Sydney didn’t want have been doing better
work lately than ever they did in the city.
With the top-hamper removed and a plat-
form built on, they have had a busy time
pulling wheat to the sidings. One big chap
has been running with 90-odd bags a trip for
me. And speed meant something this season
when the siloes were getting full, and sacks
cost 9Jd. or 10d. apiece if you had to stack
your harvest. Incidentally, this season’s
sacks are the worst quality ever landed on
us; and if we can’t make better ourselves,
we ought to be fed on thistles.

Perth has a useful little Boys’ Employ-
ment League, with representatives of all
kinds of bodies on its executive, and a sec-
retary lent by the Education Department.
During its first year, lately ended, it found
jobs for 1390 boys, 85 p.c. of them on farms.
The average age of the boys has been 17 and
the average weekly wage 10s. and keep. The
number of failures is declared to be less than
31 p.c. The league is assisted by a great
many voluntary workers; it has made no
serious appeal for funds —it has been too
busy appealing for jobs. All told last year it
spent only £203, largely on postages, etc.;
and nearly half of the money was provided
by Harry Boail, who has promised to stand
godfather again this year.

Sid Kidman lias just been told in Adelaide
that even a lawyer’s letter is not fully
privileged. One of Kidman’s employees
thought there was something to explain about
two bullocks sold by Elder Smiths; and, in
consequence presumably of representations,
Kidman’s solicitors wrote to that co., saying,
among other things: “Evidently the half-
circle has been wrongly attached by some-
one to our client’s brand. These two bullocks
belonged to our client, and we must request
you to pav us the value thereof, £24 155.”
The plaintiff firm, Elder Smiths’ clients,
alleged that it had been injured in its credit
and reputation; and H'aslam, S.M., gave
judgment in its favor for- £5O.

There has been a great digging-up of old
sailing-ships to help shift the big wheat crop.
No less than 19 will join in the race from
South Aus. The Finnish barque Herzogin
Cecilie, winner nine times, is again the
favorite. But there have been years when
she had less than half a dozen against her.

The tractor has been left in the shed
lately on scores of N.S.W. wheat farms, and
the horse-team used instead. The farm can
grow its own horse-fuel; it can’t grow the
tractor’s.

“Eloin”: Tully Mill’s crushing of 11,284
tons for one week is nowhere near a world s
record, as alleged. Many mills in Hawaii
crush more In Cuho. Riid Porto Rico they
crush up to 6000 short tons per day. In
Peru (South America) there is one that
crushes 10,000 long tons per day for 10
months of the year.
* * * *
“K.P.”: If “Wart” (B. 4/l/’33) knows
somebody who has paid £2OO an acre for
sugar land he knows of a fool who was
parted from his money. There is not a
sugar farm in Queensland worth half that
sum, if the probable return per acre is taken
as the criterion of value. “Wart” could
obtain any number of good cane farms in
Queensland for £25 an acre, with houses
and sheds, stables, wells and windmills and
implements thrown in. But if he goes to
buy the farm just before the crushing, and
wishes to cut a crop which has taken from
16 months to two years to grow, then he
must expect the total price to work out at
much more than £25. But he won t be pay-
ing the extra money for land: he will be
paying it for anything up to two years
labor, plus (in some cases) fertiliser and
other costs.
*** ■ *
“Tena”: One would think that to-day,
after years of depression, it would be pos-
sible to get property at a very low figure.
The experience of a cash buyer proved that
there are difficulties in the way of acquir-
ing bargains. One Sydney agent put it to
him succinctly: “I don’t think you will get
what you want, because most of the owners
of suitable properties have heavy mortgages
on them, and they cannot sell at the reduced
value.” In outlying suburbs bargains are
offering, but even then there is mostly a
nigger in the woodpile. With the fall in
wages it means that cottages will be built
for much less in future; so it may be
cheaper to build than to buy —until mort-
gages are written down, at any rate.
* * * *
Dear B., —Will Priminister Joe Lyons
please hint to his manufacturing friends that
the wheat cockies are not over-flush? _ I
purchased a duplicate for a header; price,
f.o.r. Sydney, £4. The local plumber made
one for a quid, so back goes the duplicate ;
and the local plumber charged too much.
The way the farmers are bushwhacked for
duplicates is too blanky hot! —P. Stkaw.

There is a growing recognition of the
beauty of Queensland timbers overseas. In
the new Northern Ireland Parliament build-
ings, recently opened by the Prince of Wales,
Queensland walnut was used in the entrance
doors, the doors, architraves and panelled
linings on the ground-floor corridors, the
passenger lift cages and landing doors, the
library bookcases, the fluted columns in the
Commons chamber, and the post-office
counter and fittings. Queensland walnut
margins were also used on the jarrah wood-
block flooring.

In normal times Britain has been taking
four-fifths of all the hams the US. have
exported, half the bacon and more than half
the tobacco—the last item alone funning
into 16-J millions sterling a year.
* * * *
“Weewondilla”: Queensland’s jump into
prominence as a tobacco-producer has estab-
lished auction sales in Brisbane, and these
have solved problems that have hitherto
defied the buvers. Thus the heavy dark type
of leaf now goes into the discard when the
catalogues are being assembled. If it gets on
to the catalogue at all it is only there to be
avoided. Also the immature leaves and
faulty curing are rectified, as far as possible,
at central handling depots. The slovenly
producer 'is being thus cut out by the good
producer. The desire to meet the market
with the right sort of leaf attractively packed
is being actively canvassed by special hand-
ling agencies, whose worst weakness is a ten-
dency to over-classification. But that should
soon right itself.
* * * *
“L.A.T.”: For the man going on the land
who merely desires to learn sufficient about
wool to class his own clip, a Technical Col-
lege sheep and wool course is invaluable.
But to those who are looking to wool-class-
ing for a living I issue this warning. The
position of this employee is infinitely pre-
carious. Wages are already low. The
N.S.W. award for a qualified wool-sorter is,
after deducting wages tax, £3 19s. 3d. p.w.
A man looking to classing for a living de-
pends chiefly on store work (repacking) in
the off season, and on classing during the
shearing season. The young classer, unless
he has influence, has little chance of secur-
ing either regular store work or classing;
and at the best his work covers often less
than three parts of the year. A man who
had been buying in the country for 20 years
last year took a job as a rouseabout in the
sheds! Professional wool-classing must
shrink with closer settlement. And to save
expense graziers to-day send their own sons
to learn the business.

Dear B., —The drive to obtain work for
boys is all to the good, but the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment bars food relief to any family
whose total earnings exceed a small amount,
and that stops many a family from making
an effort to find work for their lads. A
boy of fifteen lucky enough to get a job at,
say, 15s. a week can barely keep himself,
yet his weekly earning of this small sum
can make the family ineligible for food assist-
ance. The boy would have to pay fares and
allow for clothes out of his earnings, and
the family, having lost food relief, would be
far worse off with 1 him. working.— Beta.

Since it started on its job the Queens-
land Forestry Board has established 8194
acres of plantations, besides attending to
84,200 acres of natural forest in order to
improve the growth of cypress pine and the
more valuable hardwoods. Last season’s
planting of 1985 acres was a record for the
State ; 1,280,000 trees were used, including
chiefly hoop, slash and loblolly pines, silky
oak and Finns patula. Sales of timber dur-
ing the year totalled 38.538.815 super, feet,
an increase of. 4,000,000-odd over the pre-
vious year. Extensive planting is proposed
for the coming season, but money is scarce.

“Willeroo”: A good many of the back-

eyes—a common
comp laint out-

sun-glare and
flies are generally

cently the blacks
at the Finko

eye trouble in a

the use of whole

the customary

“Dai R.”; About the last material on
earth one would choose to carve is Aus-
tralian ironbark, but a Hurstville (N.S.W )
resident owns a figure of a horse done in
that timber. The block was hewn in 1849
from a tree that had been felled by light-
ning. Present owner’s father was then run-
ning a merry-go-round (the first ever seen
up country), and a gap in his circular team
caused by an accident prompted him to carve
a new mount from the only timber at hand.
The ironwood horse outlasted all the others,
and is still as good as new.

“Hotham”: Melbourne Aquarium is just

banal fashion, flat on his back
with his legs in the air, which,
though true to fact, is not re-
fined. Smoking a pipe, kicking

“Brilliant Deeps”: The unsophisticated
- Chinaman is hard to believe in, but here is
a Christmas story of one from Charters
Towers (N.Q.). On the first day of the
annual race meeting John arrived just before
the second-last race. The gates had been
thrown open, after the hospitable fashion on
these occasions, and he just wandered in. The
tote is an open-counter one, and John, seeing
people buying tickets, had visions of pak-a-pu
and put his money down. As he couldn’t ex-
plain what horse he wanted, an obliging clerk
gave him Yellow Plush, which won. When
a friend told John that his brihf was worth
money he rejoiced and collected, and asked
the clerk to give him another on the next.
This time he was given Love Dawn, which
won “the larst.” John, whose name was dis-
covered to bo Sam Sing, drew his money
again and went home jubilant, but regretting
bitterly that he had not come earlier in the
day.

“Murrungurry” : A squatter near Tooloom,
northern N.S.W., with ideas of better hous-
ing for the abos., gave the little mob that
roamed about the station a good three-
roomed slab-and-shingle hut that had been
vacated by a white family. A couple of
weeks after they had shifted to the new
domicile the boss rode down to see what
their housekeeping was like. To his dismay
he found the company occupying several
bark gunyahs of the usual type, while the
walls of the house were being - gradually
demolished and used for firewood. “What
are you doing that for? Why aren’t you
living in the house?” he demanded. “House
too big an’ lonely,” answered the patriarch
of the group. “Mine think it better burn
him.”

“Janet”: It isn’t necessary for the women
and kids to wait 'till the men come home
before tackling a grass fire. Another old
woman and I put out quite an extensive blaze
with old millet brooms and half a bucket
of water. We were not exhausted, as there
was no stooping. Where the grass was
short we just swept out the fire with our
damp brooms.

“Mallee Root”: The Westralian machine-
gun attack on emus wasn’t the first in which
that weapon was brought out to aid the man
on the land. A Vic. sheepman whose run
adjoined a military training camp was losing
at least one lamb a day to a wedge-tailed
eagle. In desperation he prevailed upon an
n.c.o. of the instructional staff to get per-
mission to bring a machine-gun out. Thev
set off per car, and found the enemy at
home feasting on his latest victim The
n.c.0., under cover of a low hill, got his gun
in position. The first burst fell about 50 yards
short. The enemy instantly made a break
for safety, and here the old general made
the most serious, tactical error of his career.
He took off directly in the line of fire. A
slight adjustment of the elevation, another
burst—and good night! Sheepie sprung a
fiver.

“Chelsns”: On Sunday a loud croaking
sound issued vaguely from the bowels of
my five-roomed bungalow. After a search
I discovered the culprit, a bright green frog,
seated nonchalantly between two highly-
colored ornaments on the top of a gramo-
phone stand. I collected him on a shovel
and threw him into a paddock 30 yards
away. Two days later the' croaking re-
appeared, and I discovered a frog in exactly
the same spot on the cabinet. I trans-
planted him to a creek 200 yards away.
Yesterday the croaking began again, and
from the same spot on the cabinet a frog
gazed innocently up at me. It seemed to
be the same frog each day, but why?
*❖* * *
“Plankton”: The terpsicliorean antics of
the kagui ( Rliinochctus jubatus ) give him
the right to be regarded as the world’s great-
est bird-comedian. With ruffled feathers, tail
and wings spread out, and crest erected, he
starts his ridiculous pas de seul. He bows and
scrapes in mock humility, strikes the ground
aggressively with his beak, jumps up and down
in a kind of Indian war-dance and gyrates
like a demented Dervish, sometimes holding
out the side. of his tail or a wing-tip with
his beak, while also frequently tumbling over
and kicking hysterically, as though he had
taken a fit. The kagu seems quite conscious
of tlie comicality of his actions, and in cap-
tivity he will chase and tease other birds
in pure mischief. He rather resembles our
night-bittern, and is about the size of a
white leghorn fowl. Unknown outside New
Caledonia, he is only found now in the wilder
parts of that island.

“Viau”: I hope the island natives who
recently went to the Solomons to do medi-
cal work after training in Fiji prove less
sensitive than one of the boys who helped me
to run a hospital. It had rained unceasingly
for 12 days, rice and most medicines had
become exhausted, and the sick overflowed
the accommodation ; to make matters worse,
I was upset by a bad outbreak of ulcers on
the legs that seriously hampered my move-
ments. Deciding on a drastic remedy. I
enforced the aid of my dusky lieutenant
—an exceptionally clean and intelligent lad.
I marked the spot for an intramuscular in-
jection. placed the needle in position, and
ordered him suddenly to jab it home. Taken
by surprise, he gritted his teeth and did so
—and then fainted, leaving me to get the
syringe free as best I could.
THE BULBUL.
[FO R THE BULLETIN. ]
“A brisk controversy is being waged in the ‘S. M.
Herald’ as to whether the bulbul (the Persian night-
ingale), imported from Asia in pre-war days, is a
blessing or a curse in suburban gardens and orchards.”
I dreamed the Abo. Council met
In staid and whiskered state ;
And “Gents.,” began the president,
“The subject for debate
Is whether we should try to wipe
The bulbul off the slate.
“The sparrow, all agree, ’s a pest; .
Some count the starling worse;
’Tis long since either found a friend,
But there are views diverse
Whether this Asiatic bird’s
A blessing or a curse.
“Some say lie’s death on ripening fruit
And eke on tender bud;
They curse him acrimoniously
And clamor for his- blood.
To half these disputatious blokes
The bulbul’s name is Mud.
“Yet half as stubbornly aver
He fills his tiny crop
With various forms of insect life
That fly or crawl or hop.
Among the gardener’s truest friends
They therefore rank him top.
“He makes his real meals on things
That fruit and flowers hurt.
Hence only ingrates base and vile,
They hiss, in accents curt,
Would grudge the bird a scrap of plum
Or cherry, for dessert.
THE RELIEF JOB.
"What—yer working, Mick?”
“Well, if it ain’t wurrk, it’s a dacent imitation of it.”
And glamors of the gorgeous East,
Tis claimed, around him cling;
He brings a whiff from far-off days
When old Haroun was king;
And Omar may have cocked an ear
To hear the bulbul sing.
“ ’Tis ours to vote the immigrant
O.K. or N.B.G.
These knotty questions to decide
There’s none so fit a s we,
When nature students altercate
And experts disagree.”
I dreamed the Abo. Council turned
r To solemn conclave straight;
They sifted pros and cons and gave
All sorts of witness weight;
And in their horny hands, it seemed,
There hung the bulbul’s fate.
1 fli'enmed—until a wild guffaw
Ihe slumb’rous stillness broke.
Ihe raucous kookaburra seemed
To reckon it a joke:
“The bulbul’s here—ha! ha! ho! ho!
lor good or ill, for weal or woe,”
He yelled—and then I woke.

“W.P.T.”: Discussing the finding of fish
and frogs in waterholes newly formed after
heavy rain, a bushman assured me that the
pelican is responsible. When the pelicans
notice rain approaching they go to a well-
stocked creek or dam and swallow as many
young fish and frogs as they can. Their
capacity in this respect is remarkable. Hav-
ing loaded up the birds fly off in search of
newly-formed waterholes, and there they dis-
gorge their living cargo to provide feasts for
the future.

“ Jaywill” : “Cooramin’s” panegyric (B.
4/l/’33) on record wheat loads omitted the
daddy of them all, the load of 32 tons net
that Con Ililderbrand drew 11 miles from
a stubble paddock to Caleen, near Wyalong
(N.S.W.), in 1923. It was a 35-ton waggon,
and the gross weight was 45 tons 17cwt. 2qr.
There were 15 horses in the team, and it was
a wonderful sight to see them move like one
at a flick of the whip. The claim that the
load (407 bags) established a world’s record
has not been challenged. Hilderbrand’s
daughter drove the team for part of the
journey, to oblige the photographers.

underground river. The only known
SYMPATHY.

entrance is a rocky well a few miles from
Mount Gambier. About 80ft. down this shaft
there is a large passage with a high rocky
roof through which a deep stream of fresh
water is ever flowing. Where the water goes
to, and how long the channel is, nobody
knows. Years ago, a canoe was lowered into
it, and the river followed for a considerable
distance. At the farthest point explored
there was no diminution in the size of the
passage or the depth of the water, which
flowed as if it had some clear outlet. In
the way of mysteries it rivals the vanishing
of the waters of Lake Eyre.

“H.G.F.”: Dew-ponds (B. 2/12/’32) have
been made in the Vic. Mallee. Galvanised-
iron sheets were laid on an insulating layer
of straw, a construction both simpler and
more effective than that described by
“Roga.”
si: * * *
“Ornis” : The bush still holds its secrets.
The other day what is believed to be an
entirely new variety of whip-bird was dis-
covered in the Vic. Mallee. On top of
that comes the news of the finding of two
parrots on the Lockhart River, which runs
into Lloyd’s Bay, on the east coast of Cape
York Peninsula, of a species hitherto found
in New Guinea only. Of course, the pair may
have come south across Torres Strait, but it
would be a long hop.
* * * *
“Wandi” : Most country people are used to
plagues of caterpillars, which have held up
trains at times; but a new one was sprung
on motorists the other night near Ivenmore
(N.S.W.) . Several cars skidded when passing
the school, and investigation showed that the
road for hundreds of yards was covered with
ground worms. They slithered around all
night, and some were still on the road long
after sunrise. These worms commonly rise
to the surface at night and in wet weather,
but when they strike dry ground that coats
them with dust they are' helpless, like the
eel. They are numerous in many localities,
but a simultaneous rising of millions in a
small space is one of those strange happen-
ings that astonish even the oldest inhabitant.
* * * *
“Barangkali”: Let me pour a little oil
on the quarrel about the qualities of the
green cocoanut as a drink. The discrepan-
cies of opinion arise out of the fact that
there are two widely different varieties of
cocoanut. “Coir” (B. 28/12/’32) evidently
refers to the common green nut, and I agree
with him that the contents are insipid. But
the small brown circular nut yields a sooth-
ing and palatable drink. There wmre some-
thing like three million palms on the planta-
tion where I spent many years, and amongst
these only about a hundred palms bore the
real drinking nut.
* * :]: *
“D.G.S.”: When bats hibernate they go
into cold storage. The temperature of a
torpid bat has been found to be 36deg. F., only
4deg. above freezing point; the heart-beats
were 60 to the minute. When it was
awakened the beats rose to 100 per
minute and the temperature increased two
degrees. During hibernation the vital pro-
cesses work very slowly, and there is a
minimum of waste. It is on record that in
1806, when a tomb in Norwich (Eng.) was
opened for the first time in 32 years, a
torpid bat struggled out into the sunlight.
“S.T.S.”: Tom Morris, of Sydney, has
made two attemps at the assumedly impos-
sible swim from Kangaroo Island to the main-
land of S.A. At the second one he got within
a mile of his eight-mile destination, but the
tides swept him
aside. An odd
feature was a
school of eight
porpoises which
came to investi-
gate in mid-
channel and
played all round
him for a mile or
so as he swam.
Sharks, fortu-
nately, were less
curious.

“Alice Street” :
Nothing has so in -

antics of a num-
ber of monkeys

dens. For days
they were pursued

tops until all

beg to suggest a
method of capture
which proved
eifec t i v e with
monkeys affected
as pets Jjy the
A.I.F. These
were always getting loose and making nuis-
ances of themselves. The remedy was to put
a pannikin or basin full of port from the
canteen where the monkey could get it. This
was approached with great circumspection,
but after the first sip all was lost. The monk,
couldn’t stop drinking until he couldn’t even
begin climbing, and recapture was child s
play.

“Rail-Sitter”: The annual “stampede”
held in the Canadian city of Calgary, which
arrogates to itself the rough-riding champion-
ship of the world, was founded by an Aus-
tralian, Frank P. Brown, in his
latter days in Melbourne a sport-
ing journalist. Brown took a
team of axemen and wliip-
crackers to the IJ.S.A, before
the war. In 1912. in associa-
tion with Tom Mix (then a
circus performer) and Guy
Weadick, he put on the first
Calgary Stampede, whic h
attracted broncho-busters from
all parts of the U.S.A. An
entrant for this year’s cham-
pionship, to be contested on
July 11, will be Monty Miller,
of Queensland.

“Ida D.”: “Plankton” (B.
21/12/’32) has mixed his
animals. The tuco-tuco, so-
called from the noise it makes
as it runs along, is a small
ground animal, and its skin is
of no value. It lives on the
plains. The nutria is essen-
tially a water inhabitant, liv-
ing in the swift Patagonian
rivers, difficult to catch, and
having a very valuable fur. The
true chinchilla does not inhabit
“the same region”; it is found
only on the very high Andean
slopes. This little creature is
said by the natives never to
drink water —dew is sufficient
for its needs. A cousin, the
chinchillona, is occasionally
seen on rocky knolls of the
Andean foothills, and an en-
tirely new species, with an
orange patch on the underneath
fur, was discovered a few years ago by Guy
Dawson on Pilcanen Estancia. Several skins
and an entire skeleton were sent to the South
Kensington Museum, London.
* * * *
“Rotom” : Despite the ridicule directed by
“Spare Warlock” (B. 21/12/’32) upon the
notion that a floating object may locate a
body under the water, there’s something in
it. ' When in the summer of ’95 we were
assisting the Jugiong and Coolac (N.S.W.)
police in their search for a man drowned
in the Murrumbidgee, an onlooker offered
to show the way. At the spot where the
swimmer had been overwhelmed in the flood
this man threw in a half-green willow pole
THEY OLD TRASHY LOVE-YARNS.
“And is your wife fond of reading, too, Mr. Trebuzza?"
“Iss, but ’er don’t read nothin’ good, Maister. ’Er d like they
old friction books best.”
and followed along the bank as it drifted
onward. Far dcwn the river the pole took a
circle over a deep water hole., and there he
directed the police to try with their giap-
n lings. At the first draw they brought up the
dead man. The theory was that the swerv-
ing pole had indicated the under-water de-
pression likely to hold any heavy object
floating down stream.
* * * *
“Mulgo” : Catching worms for anglers who
want bait is not suggestive of violent activity,
but it requires some skill and smartness.
Tlie quick-eyed and nimble-fingered make up
to £5 a week at it. Some work with shovels
on mud flats, their operations lasting Irom
mid tide to midtide; in that space
they dig and grab at high speed to make
the best of the time available. Other los-
sickers find the sea beaches more pleasant
to work. They are mostly armed with pin-
cers with which they pull out monsters up
to 4ft. long. But the wormer has to be quick
to grip the slithery thing before it draws
down into its stronghold. To the barelegged
urchins of the beach it is a lucrative sport.
* =!= * *
“E.S.S.”: I read once more that the
willows that grow 'along the streams near
Tumut (N.S.W.) originated from sprigs cut
from a tree near Napoleon’s grave. The
same claim is made in regard to nearly every
weeping-willow tree in Maoriland. “English”
willows were brought originally from the
Euphrates and planted in Twickenham Park,
before Napoleon was heard of, and Austra-
lia’s first willows came from England. They
were planted. I think, at Parramatta, where
many other English trees found a first Aus-
tralian home. Settlers going inland took
sprigs with them. Some were planted by
the earliest squatters on the Richmond, and
soon there wei’e hundreds of trees along the
banks of that river, branches being broken
off the originals and distributed by floods.
* * * *
“Cooramin”: Binghi’s nulla nulla, a heavy
fighting club with a knobby end, is often
a work of art; and it is the only one of
his many weapons that I have known him
to spent! hours ornamenting. First he col-
lects some old blucher boots, and extracts
the hobnails from them. These are driven
into the knobby end of the nulla, neat de-
signs being formed by the curving and cross-
ing of the rows of nail-heads, giving the
nulla an artistic, jewelled appearance.
Coupled with Binghi’s aesthetic sense, how-
ever, is the weighty consideration that the
ironclad weapon is more effective in a com-
bat than naked wood. The broad-headed
brass tacks that saddlers use on harness
are employed in the same way, and are
usually kept brightly polished. But they
are not as good as hobnails for business
purposes.
THE RIVER STEAMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the farm was new and lonely,
And the riverside was wild,
Where the noisy scrub birds only
Summer’s tardy hours beguiled,
Cheering ’twas to see the veering
Steamer smoke against the sky,
And we stood above the clearing
Just to see the boat go by.
Planter, grubbing hand and chipper,
All forgetting work and woes,
Waved a greeting to the skipper
When they leaned upon their hoes.
And we watched her twist and shiver
From wherever eyes could spy,
For ’twas “smoke-o” ’long the river
When the boat was passing by.
’Mid the corn or weed and thistle,
Or the brush we had to clear,
’Cross the bends the steamer’s whistle
Was a pleasant sound to hear;
And her coming we could measure
When we saw the herons fly,
Where the day’s event and pleasure
Was to see the boat go by.
Time brought changes, and the forest
’Long the riverside was cleared,
And the birds that called and chorused
With the thickets disappeared;
But the reeds were kept a-shiver
When two boats began to ply,
And ’twas “smoke-o” ’long the river
Now while each was passing by.

CALCULATED CRICKET.
“Lotteries and games having the element of
chance should be abolished.” —-Speaker at Anglican
Synod.
From the “S. M. Maresnest” (1/2/1942) :
The second Test, Australia v. England,
opened at the East Richmond Temperance
Hall yesterday. The blackboard was fast
and in perfect order, and a record crowd of
mathematical fans packed the building. The
two captains walked to the board at 11.30
a.m., and after a tense silence (broken only
by the squeaking of chalk) it was announced
that Slogger, M.A., had won the toss for
Australia (i.e., demonstrated by the Calculus
of Probabilities that a coin spun head up-
wards, as he would have spun it under the
old gambling regime, must have descended,
and reposed upon the floor, tail downwards)
Slogger took strike to Larford, Cambridge
Senior Wrangler and hope of the English
attack. i
Australia’s hero began confidently, and
was able to prove by the simple formula
A.F, = 5 overs + Leg Theory (Oh! Oh! D—n)
4 l.b.w.

that the first two theoretical expresses
would have whizzed wide of his leg stump.
But disaster soon followed. Settling his

pince-nez firmly and taking a faster run up
to the blackboard, the English demon un-
leashed a wicked binomial, viz.:—
Bins'! = Outed
167 m.p.h.
thus demonstrating that under the hypo-
thetical conditions Of pitch, light and wind,
the third ball his intelligence would hgve
caused him to deliver must inevitably have
scuttled the batsman. Quotations from
Addlehead (“Psychology of decision”) sup-
ported his contention that at the critical
moment Slogger’s head (influenced by
Slogger’s eyesight, digestion and degree iu
an inferior university) would have made
contact with the ball somewhere between
4 p.m. and 16 degrees N.N.W. The Board of
Professor-Umpires concurring, the Red Cross
was notified and the ambulance bore Slogger
to the Australian dressing-room.
A dramatic change occurred later, Snit-
chell’s slow algebraic twisters being severely
punished by Mcßrane and Ppnsdome. Back-
seat barrackers quickly grew caustic, and
bleats of “Put Einstein on!” and “Bowl ’im
up a logarithm!” disturbed the hitherto de-
corous silence of the hall.
When Sardine failed to
stop a hot quadratic from
Pickaxe he was derisively
advised to “get a ready-
reckoner.”
It is understood tbat
members of the Social Re-
form Committee viewed the
game, and are of the
opinion that with the
steady advance of mathe-
matics the chance element
can be still further reduced.
Actuarial tables have been
prepared showing the pro-
bable destination of the
Ashes for the next 60
years, and it may soon be
possible to decide these con-
flicts without teams having
to meet at all.

BRIGHTER BARPACKING.
Get set, everybody, for the brightest game
of the century. The Aussie selectors have
made no mistakes this time. Jack Lang is
leading our boys on the Hill, with the vet-
eran Billy Hughes directing
from the stamds.
But the Englishmen won’t
be too easy, believe me.
They’ve got a belted earl lead-
ing them in the members’
stand with a bleat that may
rattle our boys, to say noth-
ing of the platoon of Cockney
’bus drivers on the Hill.
Ah! First blood to us. Sut-
cliffe lost bis nerve before a
concerted howl from the Hill.
Here comes Jardine, shaking
like a leaf. Billy Hughes is
going to barrack him from the
members’ end, while Jack re-
arranges his field and some of
the empty bottles. Our boys
seem to be a bit short of
orange peel and are holding
their fire....
Our slow howlers are worry-
ing the visitors. They're cheer-
ing. There goes Jardine in
'tears; caught by a brilliant
“Ygh” from Jabber himself.
Jabber. Gosh! What’s this?
H'ammond goes l.b.w. to a cray-
fish from the members’ stand, off Grimmett.
.... Billy Hughes has caught Pataudi with
some quick-fire comments on the rights of
Indian minorities. ...
Here come the opening Australian pair.
The earl has just made a swipe with his
belt at Woodfull. However, he missed, and
it looks as if the ’bus drivers will have to
break the nerve of the batsmen. Folks, it’s
a close game! A fight has started in the
press stand over a “Thesaurus.” The “S. M.
Herald” man has donged the London
“Times” scribe with a full-weight “Webster.”
Bradman has gone down before a well-
directed raspberry from the Cockney out-
field, and is leaving the field with his hands
over his ears.
Well, it’s been a great game, people. Hear
the shouting? That’is the opposing bar-
rackers fighting it out on the oval- Hark!
Hear the fire-engine, sirens? Somebody’s set
fire to the pavilion.... I’d like to let you
have the scores, but bpth the official .scorers
are dead, and the police can’t decide yet
whether it’s murder or suicide. Maybe I’ll
have some more details for you during the
bedtime session.

THE CUTHROATSON SYSTEM.
Bridge Simplified.
Bridge would be an enjoyable game but
for the deplorable things done by our part-
ners. Let us assume that you, in the face of
a hostile no-trumps declaration, with A.K.Q.
and five small spades, lead off with your single-
ton diamond, or if, with four top honors,
you fail to make a bid in the hope that your
opponents will be inveigled into courting
ruin by declaring your suit. Useless in such
circumstances the disarming smile; futile
the explanation, “Well, you know, partner,
I’m unconventional.” Such unpleasantnesses
should not arise.
For the benefit of real triers, people with
an honest desire to win other people’s money
without too much mental effort, I have
accordingly evolved the iCuthroatson system.
No more old-fashioned ideas about counting-
values on your fingers, and worrying which
of the conventions you ought to use.
The C'uthroatson system is simplicity
itself. All that you need are a table with
barriers on two sides so that your feet and
those "of your partner may have unhampered
play (see my book on “The Leg Theory in
Contract”), and a resolve to abide by the
rules.
You bring to the table an ordinary garden
spade-—explaining that you want to remem-
ber to do a bit of gardening next day. The
spade is used for signalling, of course. But,
remember, Bridge is a game of subtlety.
When your partner wav.es his spade, or you
yours, it means clubs.
In the same way, when either of you
presses a hand to the left side of the chest,
it means diamonds. The fingering of the
real diamond ring bought at Bole’s for eigh-
teen pence is the convention whereby hearts
is indicated, and careless talk about going
to the club after a few hands represents a
demand for spades. With the aid of these
simple conventions a pleasant and profitable
game should be assured. Should your oppo-
nents prove successful in spite of your
efforts, the “Upsetting the Table Conven-
tion” must be employed. This is dealt with
in my “Simplified Bridge” (12s. 6d. at all
booksellers), and also in my “Body Theory
in Bridge” (255. at all booksellers), which
latter has a supplement explaining what a
loser should do to a defenceless opponent.

PHYSICAL JERKS.
“Australians are leg-pullers at heart.” — Article on

Of course ; but we do it with our heads. ;
The successful leg-puller must have a thick
skin, plenty of cheek, and an eye for easy
victims. When he has nosed out a victim,
he gets , liis teeth into him, and tells him
hair-raising stories. If the victim is a man ;
of the same kidney and has enough neck,
he will try to get some of his own back;
and the leg-puller then needs all his nerve to
toe the line and foot the consequences.

MORE MIDSUMMER MALADIES.
“The usual midsummer complaints are again
engaging the attention of the profession.”
—U edical note.
Creeping Singlet (Sinovtiteness). —The
characteristic symptom of this common
disease is a morbid feeling of uneasiness as
the singlet creeps up between the shoulder
blades. The onslaught is gradual, the
disease running its course as the temperature
approaches the century. Any physical
energy such as walking, running, etc., aggra-
vates the patient’s condition. Though some
advocate the use of treacle, orthodox medical
opinion subscribes to the view that tlie only
cure is a change of weather, singlet or both.
Testitis (Moore Park’s Disease). —-This
virulent malady, which attacks young and
old at certain well-defined periods of the hot
months, has lately assumed the proportions
of an epidemic. It is of short duration, the
attack rarely lasting beyond four to five
days. The disease itself is not dangerous,
though by some peculiar reflex action an
elderly relative of the patient often suc-
cumbs. It is particularly lethal as regards
grandmothers. The patient should be kept
in a constant state of excitement between
noon and 6 p.m. Sitting him on a Hill
in the sun will be found an effective sudorific.
Bradmaniq ( Hysteria Idiotica). —A ner-
vous disorder, being a complication arising
from Testitis (q.v.). The earliest symptom
is a feeling of jumpiness, the patient ex-
citedly and repeatedly ejaculating “Wotsee-
now?” All are subject to it, from children
to the very aged. Sporting writers of guff
dailies are particularly susceptible. Abso-
lutely incurable. Those who have been
“Sun”-struck rarely escape it.

Work Well amd Last Long
Sunshine Farm Implements have been favored by Farmers throughout Australia for over 30
years. There are reasons for this, and one is that “Made at Sunshine Harvester Works”
stamped on an Agricultural Implement or Machine is a guarantee of solidity, precision, long
wear, low upheep, and ability to do the job in a satisfactory manner under Australian con-
ditions. Only a few implements are mentioned here, but an illustrated Catalogue and Frice
List will be posted free to any Farmer who is interested.

THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
SUB. CLOVER FOR FAT LAMBS.
“R. K. Deea”: In many parts of Victoria
it has been found that top-dressing with
super., associated with the sowing of sub.
clover, results in a greater yield of richer
pasture. One result is chat the rams and
ewes which in other days proved to be the
most economical and suitable for raising
early lambs no longer serve the purpose. In
Melbourne recently a line of 220 fat lambs
topped the market. They were a Border
Leicester cross, bred, raised and consigned
py John Hamilton, of Ivarramomus (Vic.).
1 Mr. Hamilton is one of the original selec-
tors of the belt of country situated between
Arcadia and Emma. The soil is a shallow
pink-grey silt loam, with the typical good
red clay subsoil of the Gonlburn Valley dis-
trict. The rainfall is about 20 inches. This
farmer has, in his unobtrusive way, made a
study of his farm, and has been quick
in taking advantage of any new development.
When his trial of sub. clover exceeded
expectations, arrangements were immediately
made to improve stubble pasture by sowing
a pound or two of sub. seed with the cereal.
On a recent visit to the farm I saw a pad-
dock black and matted with the clover. Not
at. all picturesque, but the woollies were
being fattened on what was practically clover
hay. Mr. Hamilton informed me frankly
recent results were so good that the sheep
had become his star line. Where wheat in
the past had kept the sheep; the sheep were
now keeping the Wheat. As a matter of
fact, the farm has been improved to such an
extent that it has been changed from a dry
wheat farm to an excellent grazing propo-
sition, with the owner considering the advisa-
bility of placing all his eggs in the one
basket.
The alterations in method have resulted in
a change in the flock. The Shropshire cross
of the past has been displaced by the Border
Leicester, which to all appearances is emi-
nently suited to the rich improved pasture.
Asked for his views on wheat, Mr. Hamil-
ton replied: “I am getting Is. lOd. a bushel
f.o.r. The bag cost threepence, cartage five-
pence, manure about twopence a bushel.
There’s not much left for frills and flounces.”
LIMING AND SUPERING PASTURES.
“O’Gorman”: An interesting statement
bearing upon the question of liming in the
improvement of pastures has been given by
the. S.A. Agricultural Department; it em-
bodies the results arrivc.d at on the experi-
mental farm at Kybybolite during 13 years.
The land (average rainfall, 21 inches) w r as
of rather less than sheep-to-the-acre capacity,
carrying wallaby, barley and silver grasses,
with some annual trefoils.
At present part of the land treated with'
1801 b. super, per year is carrying four sheep
to the acre. Another section given 901 b.
carries 3f sheep to the acre. A plot limed
with a ton in 1919, and another in 1929, to-
gether with lewt. super, per annum, carries
sheep per acre. A plot given a ton of
gypsum in 1926, and annual dressings of
lewt. super., also carries 31 sheep to acre.
On six plots treated for 11 successive years
with super, only, the increase in carrying
capacity is 126 p.c. On land dressed with
lime and super, the increase is 270 p.c. The
sheep run on the limed land have shown
better lambing averages and bodily condition,
while wool-production lias increased 230 p.c.
as against 207 p.c. for the supered land.
DORSET HORN AND MERINO.
“Golightly”: A visit to Homebush
(N.S.W.) shows more merino lambs in the
pens than crossbreds. Both sold on their
respective merits in prime condition, the
crossbred lamb brings shillings more per
head. Most lamb-raisers know this, and know
also that the progeny of first-cross ewes from
’Down rams is the best cross.
The trouble with first-cross ewes is that
they won’t mate early enough in worthwhile
numbers, their principal drop of lambs com-
ing in July and August. Thus in my dis-
trict (Merriwa, N.S.W.) barley grass and
corkscrew settle them, irrespective of breed-
ing. Good merino lambs dropped in March
are sold about the time the first-cross ewes
are lambing. Instead of a merino lamb out
of a merino ewe dropped in March, I advo-
cate mating a Dorset Horn in September-
October with the merino ewe. Both sheep
will mate at any time to suit the natural
pastures of a district and their early drop
of first-class lambs is good. As a second
barrel, have the first-cross ewes (any long-
wool on merino) lambing in July-August
(apparently their natural time) on specially-
prepared pastures. In our district Wimmera
rye and lucerne, if thoroughly cultivated, will
smother barley grass and produce first-class
fat sucker lambs for export.
YOUNG SHEEP DYING.
“Valerin” : These times losses of weaners
aue abnormally high in parts of N. S. Wales.
As the mortality may be traced to several
sources, owmers are not making much head-
way in checking it. The principal causes
are: (1) Worms, which can invade all
organs from the brain to the rectum. Close
feeding and stagnant water as a result of
the long dry spell would accentuate this
parasitical infestation. (2) Malnutrition
through shortage of mineral necessities ; old
pastures will be subject to this. (3) The
great increase of rabbits, which eat out the
best grasses. (4) Overstocking. To com-
pensate for low returns for wool, etc., pro-
perties are stocked far beyond their carry-
ing capacity.
There are many drenches, licks and other
specifics on the market, but before incurring
expense get the advice of a competent vet.
and ascertain what the trouble really is and
treat accordingly. ' The Agricultural Depart-
ment employs capable men stationed in large
centres who will inspect flocks, diagnose
complaints and make recommendations for
treatment free.
As the country grows older graziers are
going to be faced with serious problems in
the way of pasture renovation and new
diseases. Pressure should be brought to
bear on their associations for the appoint-
ment of expert advisers; the cost per head
need not exceed 10s. p.a.
CULLING NONDESCRIPT EWES.
“Jumbuck”: Every farmer can improve
his flock if he will only take the trouble
to look at his breeding ewes while they are
being shorn. Trying to cull out from among
shorn sheep is waste of time. The pro-
cedure is simplicity itself. In the case of
merinos—taking, of course, size of frame
into consideration—look for ewes, that are
cutting inferior fleeces; those with short-
stapled wool and wasty backs, and any whose
fleeces show that strong, hairy-like breech
portion. Raddle these ewes on the head and
oust them from the flock. Sell, fatten off
for killing, or cut their throats rather than
allow them to breed, for their lambs will be
sure to take after them. Like begets like
in the sheep-breeding world, and a mongrel
ewe throws a mongrel lamb, perhaps of a
worse type than the ewe.
With’ crossbreds the job may be more
difficult t’o the novice. Lamb-breeding rather
than wool-growing may be the objective.
Even so, the poor type of ewe must be
thrown out. Standardising the flock, no
matter how small, should be the aim of all
sheepmen, and success in attaining this lies
in the culling-out of nondescript types of
ewes.
A KYABRAM AYRSHIRE.
Five and twenty years ago the Ayrshire
was the most popular breed of dairy cattle
in Victoria. Senior Inspector Mess has it
that two-thirds of the Victorian herds showed
at least traces of Ayrshire blood. But of
latter years the breed has lost its popularity.
Says Mr. Mess, writing in the “Journal of
Agriculture,” “When the Standard Herd
Test was inaugurated., many Ayrshire
breeders refused to submit their herds. The
penalty of this obstinacy is being paid to-
day.”
All the same, some dairymen have remained
constant to the Ayrshire, and the brothers;
Telford, of Kyabram, have no regrets on that
score. It is they w T ho own Dolly IV, of Glen-
gowrie, a noted prize-winner at shows and,
though rising 16, still a heavy yielder. Mr.
Mess gives her record for eight years in
the Standard Herd Test: —
Tear. Lb. Milk. Av. Test. Lb. Fat.
1921- . . 8.492 4.42 375.64
1922- . . 9,762 4.33 428.77
1924- . . 12,010 4.27 512.61 ‘
1925- . . 12,256 4.46 546.32
1926- .. 10,928 4.47 488.18
1928- . . 13,316 4.29 , 570.69
1929- . . 11,192 4,06 454.66
1931-32 . . 11,772 4.19 493.22
Average . . 11,204.75 4.31 483.76
In pounds of milk on the last day of each
test she averaged 28|. Seven cows in the
Telford herd are descendants of Dolly IV. of
Glengowrie, and all are shaping well.
THE GOOD DOER.
“Jack Point”: “I don’t like that strain
much,” said my neighbor; “she’s always
breaking through the fences into the cultiva-
tion. Her mother was the same, and so was
her grandmother.”
Admittedly there are cows which wreck
fences apparently for the love of the thing,
but there are lots of good doei’s which break
through into the cultivation simply because
they are hungry. They’re not actually starv-
ing", but they’re not getting a complete ration,
and are spurred on by some instinct which
tells them that some of that young green stuff
would furnish what their ordinary pasture
lacks. My neighbor’s cow is sufficiently
well-bred to produce a lot more milk and
cream than she is giving. Because she is
a good doer, she can’t be content with just
enough to live and produce a little bit on.
If you have some good doers which try
to get through the fences into the cultivation,
don’t deter them with huge branches of blue-
gum round their necks. Try weighing their
milk against that of cows which seem content
to sit down and chew the cud all day; then
sec if the good doer isn’t worth a bjt extra
in the shape of bran, linseed meal and cot-
tonseed meal. A small allowance of a cereal
mixture fed at milking time will help to
balance the ration, and make for a contented,
as well as a better-producing, herd.
PIG RECORDING.
“V.S.M.”: At stud pig sales in Sweden
buyers are furnished with as complete a
performance-record as is usual in the case
of pedigreed milking cattle. The idea is. to
demonstrate (1) prolificacy, (2) milking
capacity and ability to rear a litter, (3)
early maturity of progeny. So the record
shows (in addition to the breeding and de-
scription of the. animal itself) the number
of teats possessed by the dam, and, in re-
spect of each farrowing, the date, number of
pigs in the litter at birth and at three weeks,
total weight of litter at three weeks,
average weight per pig, and the variation
(lowest and heaviest weights). Similar par-
ticulars are given for the grand-dam and the
sire’s dam.
How valuable this information is to a
purchaser is proved by the records of the
Pig Recording Clubs now flourishing in
Maoriland. An actual case is that of a
sow whose litter of ten weighed 5051 b. at
eight weeks, while the ten of another sow
on the same farm weighed only 3601 b. at
the same age. C. P. McMeekan, of
Massey Agricultural College, writing in the
“Dairy Exporter,” says that the Manawatu
club has raised its average litter weight at
eight weeks from 2271 b. to 3021 b. since 1928-
29. The good results are attributed to selec-
tion of sows and sires on performance-
record, to employment of the creep method of
feeding for young pigs, to running on good
short grass, and to judicious use of small
quantities of meals.
LOOK AFTER THE MACHINES.
“Deekay”: As soon as harvesting is over
the farmer should commence to overhaul his
sowing and fallowing machinery. If the cul-
tivator or scarifier has to deal with weedy
ground new points should be fitted w’herever
the old ones are badly worn. This done,
it may be found, on looking along a, row of
tines, that some are out of position. Adjust
the tines' or fit new ones if the old ones are
strained; if this is not done a ridgy, uneven
seed-bed will be the result.
If the drill was not cleaned out immedi-
ately after last sowing season, make sure it
is ; done this year. The caked fertiliser
should be chipped off the stars until they
may be easily turned by the handle supplied
by the maker, while the machine is out of
gear. The wheat runs should also be
cleaned. Any runs which are stiff or jammed
can usually be freed with a few drops of
crank-case’ oil and by gently tapping the
wheel of the run with a spanner. Before
putting horse-power on the drill be sure
that both manure and fertiliser runs are
turning freely, as this not only lightens the
draught considerably, but also minimises
the risk of breakages. Any spokes which
are broken in the wheels should be replaced,
as others very quickly follow after the first
one breaks. It. is most important that the
oil-holes and oil-tubes should be thoroughly
cleaned to make sure the oil is reaching
every bearing. Bolts which are worn or
missing from the frame should be replaced.
A little time spent in an overhaul at the
beginning of the season often saves a great
deal of annoyance and delay caused by
breakages when time is valuable.
TO MEET FIJI COMPETITION.
“Y.A.L.”: There is no getting away from
the fact that people who have bought Fiji
bananas since the embargo was lifted in
part pronounce them better than the best
Australian bananas available these last few
years and immeasurably superior to the low-
grade stuff. And unfortunately there have
been heaps of low-grade stuff on barrows and
in shops. It is doubtless true, as Senior
Fruit Inspector Eastwood suggests in the
“Agricultural Gazette of N.5.W.,” that Fiji
is sending only its highest-quality, fruit to
Australia; but to moot this competition boy-
cotts or threats of boycotts will not avail.
“Growers,” says Mr. Eastwood truly, “will
need to size and grade their fruit faithfully,
and to pack and brand it properly and
attractively.” Irregularities in grading and
incorrect branding affect the sale of even
inferior fruit.
This fruit instructor advises growers not
to allow bananas to become over-full before
cutting, and, not to pack fruit which is likely
to color in transit. Fruit, he says, should
always be carefully placed in the case and
packed tightly and neatly. Bananas in the
rows should touch the sides and ends of
the cases and be keyed in position by the
end fruit in each row. Open centres in the
pack should be closely and firmly filled with
the same grade of fruit in order to keep
the rows' in position and the fruit flush
with the sides and ends of the case before
commencing the next layer. Paper on the
bottom and top of the case is all that is
necessary during the summer period.
DATE-GROWING IN AUSTRALIA.
“Jethro Tull”: Regarding “E.P.B.’S” sug-
gestion (B. 11/l/’33) that date-growing
might be worth considering in this country.
Two types arc imported, though the bulk of
the import consists of the self-preserving
date that contains up to 60 p.c. sugar. The
other kind contains: less sugar and will not
keep for long; it is usually consumed as
fresh fruit and is used only in limited quan-
tities. However, it is earlier maturing than
the other, and on this account would be
more suitable for this climate. There is a
third type, the dry date, which forms the
stable diet of the Arab, but it is not likely
'that any demand could be created for it
here.
The mean annual rainfall of the best
date-producing areas of the world is in most
instances below 4in. In parts of the U.S.A.
it rises to 7in., but in every instance where
natural ripening is the practice the rain
occurs during the winter months. Unless
artificial ripening is practised, a rainless
period of at least six months must occur to
allow proper development of the fruit. But
it must not be imagined that water is un-
necessary. Unless an adequate supply of
soil moisture is present, the fruit becomes
dry, shrivelled and fails to develop.
The mean annual temperature should not
be below 70deg. F.; and, though our western
areas are known for their hot summers, there
are few places in Australia that can register
a mean temperature approximate to this.
Suitable soil would not be difficult to
obtain, as the mature palm is particularly
tolerant of alkali conditions; but the young
suckers need a neutral soil for their best
development, and this would necessitate
planting in a well-prepared bed and later
transplanting to the permanent position.
Covering of the bunches would also be neces-
sary to prevent damage from rain and in-
sect injury.
The palms, once established, will bear for
over a hundred years.
One difficulty would b(f in securing suckers
and pedigree seed. These would have to
come from California or other parts of the
U.S.A., and the ultimate cost of landing
would be considerable. Pedigree seed would
be easier transported, but there is always
a hazard with seed planting—it is not pos-
sible to determine the sex of the seed prior
to planting. So the seed must be sown in
rows the required distance apart and the
male plants removed after the first flower-
ing to the required number for pollination
purposes, usually 1 p.c., and other (female)
plants used to fill in the spaces.
It will be apparent from this that the
establishing of a. plantation of date palms
is a slow and somewhat costly business.
POTATO-GRADING.
“R.X.8.” : There is good money in growing
potatoes if the game is run properly. Bad
marketing is to blame for big losses to the
growers. In Sydney many bags arrive at
the central markets with badly-sized, fork-
stabbed, diseased and growthy spuds; some
have clods of dirt or an occasional pumpkin
inside to make up the weight. The grower
suffers, even if paid diggers were respon-
sible for the dirty trick. Don’t let bags
go straight from the field to the markets.
Bring them all into a shed, empty them out,
and re-bag over a table, so that you will
know your consignment is up to standard.
Then your brand will become known, and
your bags sought. But you must observe
the grade. N.S.W. law requires it, any-
how. The regulations under the Act of
1924 have been altered, and the grower must
observe the requirements for five grades. In
plain language these are:—
No. 1 Grade.—Sound spuds of the same
variety and mature skins, reasonably free
from second growth, decay, injuries (such as
fork-stabs), disease, greening or sunburn,
dirt and insects. Each spud must not be less
than 3oz. in weight. That means you will

THERE is no greater obstacle to social
and business success than a nervous
and shy disposition. There is no
human weakness so humiliating and
responsible for so much secret misery
and despair as this unfortunate afflic-
tion. Nervousness deprives you of the
ability to reveal your real self, to develop
your talents and make headway in the
battle of life. Neither ambition, talent
nor hard work can achieve success when
handicapped by nervous fears.
If you are a victim of this distressing
mental disorder, if you are nervous and
shy, if you blush and stammer when
spoken to, if you feel awkward and em-
barrassed in company, if you are letting
opportunities slip by through being too
nervous to step out of the crowd and
become a leader instead of one of the
led—daere is a real chance to conquer
your weakness instead of letting it
conquer you here is your chance to
become forceful and red-blooded.

AUSTRALIA FIRST.
“Stuffing”: Victorian farmers have been
advised by one of the Government poultry
experts that there is a good market in Brit-
ain for table poultry from Australia, pro-
vided British tastes are studied. For
instance, J. Bull won’t have birds with
yellow or black legs. He likes the Light
Sussex and Buff Orpington breeds, but effn’t
stand White Leghorns, Australorps or Rhode
Island Reds. “Unfortunately,” the expert
remarks, “no serious attempt has been made
by Victorian poultrymen to produce good
table poultry, either for the local! trade or
for export. More than 500,000 birds for
table purposes were sold in the auction
rooms in Melbourne alone last year. A very
small percentage of these w’ere marketed in
good condition.”
Well, why should this be so? As a con-
sumer, why should I have to pay 4s. or ss.
for a third-rate fowl when almost any time
of the year I can get a good forequarter of
mutton for a shilling, a leg for eighteen-
pence and a sirloin of beef for two shillings?
And where is the sense in going after an
export trade when the Australian market,
in which such prices are obtained, is so
badly catered for?
“In Victoria,” our expert says—-and I
suppose it is the same in other States —-
“poultry-farmers have concentrated on the
breeds that gave them the best returns in eggs,
and have been satisfied to market their sur-
plus cockerels and worn-out laying hens at
whatever price was offered. If they arrived
at the market in good condition, it was, in
most cases, more by good luck than good
management. For years auctioneers have
been complaining bitterly of the poor con-
dition in which most poultry are sent in.”
This is no credit to the industry and no
good to Australia. By all means let our
poultry-farmers produce table birds for ex-
port, as the gentleman suggests; but let
them satisfy the needs of the Australian
market first. It is, a great market, and it
is very poorly supplied; and that goes for
turkeys, ducks and geese, as well as fowls.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Latest figures of the wheat bought by the
Q’land Wheat Board? Price paid by the
pool to growers and the amount of the fund
held to cover loss under their hail insurance
scheme? —3652.
For the 1930-31 season the board handled
4,550,025 bushels, 89 p.c. of which was of
milling quality and 11 p.c. feed wheat.
Growers were paid 3s. lid. per bushel for
No. 1; 3s. 9d. and 3s. lOd. per bushel for
No. 2 and 3s. 7d. and 3s. Bd. per bushel for
No. 3 milling wheat. During that season
the hail insurance fund stood at £28,330,
and compensation to, growers, to the extent
of £3105 was paid.
I find that as a reasonably-sized Tas.
pastoral property comes into the market it
is acquired by the adjoining pastoralist.
How is it that credit can be acquired for
obtaining, more land on which to extend the
languishing occupation of sheep-f arming?—
3512.
One or two cases of pastoral properties
reverting to an adjacent landowner have
occurred, but in each case it is the vendor
who has taken back the land after the pur-
chaser has found himself in financial diffi-
culties.
Is it necessary for a N.S.W. farmer to
register his tractor? It is sometimes used
for chaffcutting and threshing at neighboring
farms, and on these occasions may have
to travel by road. —3757.
If a tractor is used on a public road it
must be registered and tax must be paid at
the rate of 3s. 6d. per each 4ewt. of its
weight. A deduction of 6d. per is
allowed in respect of tractors which com-
prise 75 p.c. British labor and material. The
registration fee is £l.
(1) Am I complying with the N.S.W.
Unemployment Relief Tax Act if I deduct
Is. 6d. per week from a hand drawing 545.
6d. per week, not found? (2) What would
a man draicing £3 per week and keep have
to pay in tax? (3) If I let a contract for
cleaning out silt in a dam, does the con-
tractor have to pay unemployment relief
tax? If he does, ichat rate of tax must he
pay? (4) Must money paid for contract
work be included in the family endowment
tax by the employer? —372o.
(1) Yes. (2) Is. on each complete £
included in the payment made, plus value
of allowances. (3) Unless the contractor
employs labor to assist him, you should
deduct unemployment relief tax from pay-
ments made. The rates are: Weekly earnings
of £2 to £2 ,10s., Is.; exceeding £2 10s. to
£3, Is. 6d.; exceeding £3 to £3 10s., 25.;
exceeding £3 10s., Is. in the complete £. (4)
If the relationship of master and servant
exists between the person letting the con-
tract and the contractor, the former is liable
to family endowment tax in respect of pay-
ments made. If such circumstances do not
apply, tax is not payable.
(1) Can bricks be made from black clay
or red loam without kilns or moulds? (2)
Any mixture other than cement which will
make earth hard so that it will not soften
after rain? (3) Any paint or mixture which
will preserve troughing, tanks, etc., from
rusting away, especially those used for
highly-mineralised water? Pitch, tar and
other such mixtures are eaten off soon after
application. —3722.
(I) No. (2) A fair surface can be obtained
by making a path' of ant-bed to a depth of
from three to six inches, well watered and
tamped. Tar is good, but melts in hot
weather. Asphaltum is also satisfactory, and
particulars regarding its application, cost,
ere., can be procured from the Australian
Gas Light Co., Ltd., Sydney. (3) You might
try Plymel paint, at 9s. per gallon, from
Anthony Horderns’, Sydney, specially recom-
mended for tank and trough interiors; or
W and F paint, agent. B. B. Fabian, 76
Pitt-street, Sydney. The Agricultural De-
partment of your State may be able to
advise you on this subject.
I have two trees on my North Queensland
property which have been identified as icing
Sebesten plums. Apart from their orna-
mental value, what uses are made of them?
—3874.
In India the tender young, shoots and the
kernel are eaten. A pectoral medicine is
derived from the tree under the name of
Sebestens. The bark is used as a mild tonic.
The wood, which is grey to, light brown in
color, and soft, is said to have furnished the
timber for Egyptian mummy-cases. It is
used in India for boat-building, and to make
covers for Burmese cheroots. The viscid
pulp of the fruit is made into birdlime, and
the kernel yields a marking ink.
I have a din, centrifugal pump whose
capacity greatly exceeds requirements. (1)
In order to maintain the necessary water
velocity : in the pipes to convey the solids,
would it be practicable to use Sin. suction
and discharge pipes? (2) Would the power
expenditure be greater in this case than if an
ordinary Sin, pump were used?— 3Bso.
(J) It would be practicable provided the
suction and discharge pipes are not unduly
long. If the suction pipe is very long, reduce
the discharge pipe only to 3in. (2) Yes.
(1) Correct food, and quantities, for 12
Wyandotte pullets? (2) Same for six Mus-
covy ducks and drake?— 37s4.
Quantity will vary with seasons and con-
dition of the birds. They should receive just
as much as they can consume in at least
two feeds per day. As a guide 12 pullets
will consume approximately mash each
morning and a similar amount of grain each
evening. The six ducks and one drake will
consume about the same amount of food as
the 12 Wyandottes.
HINTS FOB THE FARM.
“Yalerin”: When buying salt for stock
don’t go for the very Coarse variety because
it seems cheaper. It is not. Inspect the
troughs and you will find a considerable per-
centage dropped about and trampled into the
earth.
“Gumblegubbin”: So-called dog-proof
fences, intended also to block rabbits, require
to be inspected frequently where foxes are
prevalent. These pests, instead of climbing
over, sometimes burrow underneath, and thus
render the fence ineffective as a rabbit bar-
rier. As Bunny follows the netting, looking
for an opening, one burrow’ might let hun-
dreds through in a night. ’ „’ \
“Teiirag” : The best time to mow lucerne
cannot, be , determined always by the flower-
ing development. Safer guidance is provided
in the development of basal shoots. When
fresh shoots at the bases or crowns of the
plants are about an inch long the lucerne
should be mown.
“Mudgee” : To get rid of bindweed, chop
the heads off every time they appear. Just
chip the green off the ground and in less
than one summer the bindweed will be gong.
I have tried every known method, and this
I have found effective.
“Tcna”: Sweet corn has a tendency to
stool out from the bottom. To get nice cobs
these stools must be cut off and one central
stalk only allowed to grow. One of the
best vai’ieties is Country Gentleman, a white
corn of prime quality.
“Echuca” : If your Dorset rams are knock-
ing each other about top much, tie a semi-
circular piece of leather or canvas about
lOin. wide to the horns so as to hang over
the eyes.
“Bill R.”: When a heavily-laden waggon
or; dray is to be hauled up hill, have the
forward ends of two stout saplings chained
to the guard rails, and their other ends
dragging behind. Then the load cannot run
backwards. And the staunch fellows ahead
will not be unduly distressed when the
slackers ease their pull, or when the whole
team is halted for a blow.
“Buffprp”: In N.. S. Wales there’s a fair
amount of bumblefoot among the chooks.
Don’t let it get too bad before you soak the
foot in hot water and open the abscess,
squeezing out the contents. Wrap a piece of
kerosene-soaked rag round the foot to stop
the dirt getting in, and keep -the hen in a
straw-lined coop for a few’ days. With this
treatment I’ve never had a loss or failure.
“Sylvester”: One often has to wait for
suitable weather for planting, and then do
a lot of work with a rush. Keep a spare
share for your plough, and you will not have
to stop t 0 have your share done up.
“J.S.P.”: Before putting a padlock in
any position exposed to the weather, fill 'it
with oil and repeat every six •months.
“Gardener”: A roan who makes a living
selling plants and seedlings stands the legs
of his seed-boxes in tins of water to check-
mate ants. The boxes - (alw-ays in the
shade) are soaked in water first, and the
damped soil filled in. After planting the
seed—always mixed with sand as a carrier
—he covers the boxes with a damp bag,
which is kept damp till the seeds germinate.
Using these methods he gets rapid and full
germination with no loss.
“Beady”: When planning out small pad-
docks for better pastures and rotational graz-
ing make full use of extending lane and check
gates. This makes available water, shade
and camping place, and does away with the
almost impossible problem of having water,
shade and camp within each small grazing
paddock. Duplicate the plan, and store stock
can clean up the roughage, after the milkers
or fatters have been forced along on the
fresh pastures.

Information Sought.
What suggestions were made fry Admiral,
Jellieoe when he visited Australia about 12
years ago t 6 report on our Navy, and were
they acted upon? —3B63.
His report, presented in August, 1919,
recommended that the Australian Navy
should consist of two new battle-cruisers,
eight light cruisers (four in commission
and four in reserve), one flotilla leader, 12
destroyers (10 in full commission and two
in reserve), one destroyer depot ship, eight
submarines and one small submarine parent
ship. The report was not acted on. The
Australian Navy at present consists of two
10,000-ton cruisers, one seaplane-carrier and
one destroyer in commission, and two . small
cruisers and five old destroyers in reserve.
Where to apply for a position in connec-
tion with the taking of the 1933 census? —

(1) Is there a Queensland timber suitable
for making a fishing-rod? (2) Recipe for a
Cement to attach rod-ferrules? (3) Is any
form of agate suitable for rod-rings obtain-
able locally? (4) How to make from the rate
material the rubber buttons used on tlfe ends
of rods? (5) How to color a white timber
an orange-yellow (similar to cane) before
varnish is applied? —3492.
(1) Saffron heart ( Halfordia sp.) is
recommended. A paper describing other suit-
able timbers has been posted. (2) If fer-
rules are properly fitted and thoroughly
seasoned timber is used, waterproof glue or
shellac is satisfactory. Some makers use
a small pin to prevent any possibility of
the ferrule moving. (3) Agate occurs in
Q’land in the Etheridge and Stanthorpe dis-
tricts, but it is probable that manufacture
from the raw stone would be more costly
than buying the ready-made article. (4)
Highly technical process. One of the rubber
cos. might be willing to advise.. (5) A light
oak stain is very suitable.
When and how to top-dress chrysaAithC-
mum beds? —3879.
The plants will be benefited by spreading
over the surface of the bed towards the end
of January a compost made up of loam and
stable manure, in about equal quantities, with
a sprinkling of bonedust or some other
phosphatic manure and soot, covering the
ground to a depth of about llin. Nitrogenous
artificial manures are useful, but they must
be used sparingly.

England) : 8,4, 38, 32, 113, 35, o, 13, 60.
(3932 in Australia) : 112, 8, 23.
In a tennis match the umpire or a lines-
man calls “out,” and then, instantly changes
and calls “play.” The receiver fails to re-
turn the ball and claims he Was prevented
from so doing by the umpire or linesman.
Has he any redress?-— 3898.
Yes. Tile umpire must grant lam a let
unless it is perfectly clear to him that the
mistaken call was not in any way the cause
of the receiver’s failure to return the ball;
in that case the point stands. In the ease
of a clear service ace, pass or replacement,
the point stands. Of course, where the final
decision of the linesman is “out,” a l<jt
should not be called in any case as the
player who struck the ball loses the point.
(1) General exemptions allowed N.S.W.
payers of income tax? (2) Other deductions
allowed to resident taxpayers?-— -8871.
(1) £250, less £1 for every_ £8 by which
the taxable income exceeds £250. (2) Pay-
ments up to £5O for life assurance and
fidelity guarantee; £5O for each child under
the age of 16 years; £5O for wife; up to
£5O contributed by unmarried taxpayer to
dependants; up to £lOO for friendly society
benefits and superannuation if taxpayer is
wage-earner or his taxable income is not
over £800; medicaland dental expenses or
funeral expenses of a taxpayer, his wife,
family or dependants, if taxable income not
over £400; up to £5O for education of each
child under 18 years where suitable facili-
ties are not provided by the State, if taxable
income does not exceed £BOO.
Soil requirements for growing poppies ?■ —
3884.
Most suitable soil is a fairly rich, friable
loam, containing a small proportion of grit
and well drained. Sandy soils require the
addition of well-decayed cow or stable manure,
and a sprinkling of bonedust worked into
the ground at the same time is beneficial.
Heavy soils should be lightened by the addi-
tion of lime and well-decayed manure, to-
gether with bonedust. The plants require
plenty of water during dry weather.
(1) If the chairman of a meeting accepts
a motion of dissent from Ms ruling, should
he vacate the chair, and should, another chair-
man be appointed while the motion is being
put to the vote? (2) If the motion of dis-
sent is carried, should he then permanently
vacate the chair? —-3811.
(1) Parliamentary procedure, as exempli-
fied in the Standing Orders of the N.S.W.
Leg. Assembly, is that a ruling of the Speaker
may. be dissented from by motion, but the
Speaker does not vacate the chair. (2)
Not consequently. He may do so if lie re-
gards it as a vote of censure or want of con-
fidence.
(1) What is the effect of stinging by
“ bluebottles ”? (2) Is the sting likely to
prove fatal? (3) What does the injury look
like? (4) Treatment?—3B37.
(1) Something resembling an electric shock
is followed by intense pain, fainting and col-
lapse, sometimes profuse sweats and cold
skill. Headache, nausea, vomiting and some-
times paralysis may ensue, with a conva-
lescence of several days. In a case on record
the pain lasted three Weeks. (2) Children
up to 12 years of age may be fatally injured.
(3) The injury looks like a burn. (4) Rub
the skin vigorously With sand, both wet and
dry; the latter is the quicker to act, but
both are efficient in removing the pain. The
sand destroys the stinging darts and mini-
mises the amount of poison injected. Appli-
cations of laundry blue, soda, ammonia or
Condy’s fluid to the sting have proved useful
as emergency measures.
What is isinglass, what are its uses, and
where is it manufactured? —-3851.
It is a variety of gelatine obtained from
the dried swimming bladders of fishes. It
is used for culinary purposes, for clarifying
beer and wine, and for making cement and
plaster. It is manufactured chiefly in
Russia* Canada, Brazil and the Indies.
(1) What Australian wines are com-
monly fortified? (2) What types may be
regarded as perfectly natural?— 37l2.
(1) All Australian sweet wines are forti-
fied. This is not doctoring, but is neces-
sary to retain the sugar content. Unless
wines containing sugar are fortified to
35deg. proof spirit there is a grave possi-
bility of secondary fermentation, the yeast
attacking sugar when in a solution of a
lower alcoholic strength than that men-
tioned. The principal fortified wines are
port, muscat, frontignac, sherries (sweet
and dry) and tokay. (2) Perfectly natural
wjnes are claret, hock, burgundy and chablis.
Sauternes contain a small degree of sugar
which is retained by the presence of sulphur
dioxide.
Tg what length do white sharks attain?
Are they man-eating , and are they found
in cbastal waters? —3848.
Specimens 40ft. in length have been
caught, and there is evidence that some
attain double that length. They have been
known ;to devour human beings. Members
Of the species. Bft. to 10ft. in length, arc
fairly numerous in the neighborhood of Port
JackSon,\ and a Vic. specimen measured
36£ft
Who teds the last male full-blooded Tas-
manian aboriginal, and what was his his-
tory?—3Bss.
William Lanne of Lanney, also ( called
King Billy. He was born about 1835, and
was the youngest child in the last family
of aborigines ■to remain at large on the
mainland of Tasmania. In 1842, seven years
after all the other aborigines had been re-
moved, this family of six was brought from
Cape Grim, in the far north-west, by a
sealer. Lanney was removed to Oyster Cove
in 1856. He was a quick, active young
fellow, and became a whaler; in February,
1869, lie was paid off from the whaler
Runnymede, went on a drinking bout, and
died in Hobart hospital on March 3, 1869.
A Queensland paper reported an injury
to a man resulting in a passing form of
paralysis, contracted by treading on a gds-
terdpod. Are gastcropods poisonous?—
3853. , .
An Australian species is capable ot in-
dicting severe injury, and even death. Conus
geographus, a gaily-Colored cylindrical shell
about 3ih. long, lurks under stones on Coral
reefs. Luckily it is very rare. The salivary
glands of this and the related species C.
textilis and C. tnlipa excrete a venom, the
poisonous effects of which resemble those
of curari, and the fadula lias developed long,
sharp points by which Conus stabs its
victim and administers a minute dose of
poison. The stab is extremely painful, and
the limbs are rapidly paralysed. The para-
lysis continues for several hours, and may
end fatally. The native method of obtain-
ing relief is to cut the desli round the wound,
inducing blood to flow.
For what service is the King's Police
Medal awarded? Note is it worn, and can
bars be added?— 376o.
The modal was instituted in 1909 as a
reward “for acts of exceptional and
skill or conspicuous devotion to duty’’ to
officers and men of any recognised police
force or fire brigade in the British Empire.
The medal is worn on the left breast
with a riband of five stripes of dark blue
and silver. Bars may be added.

(1) In salting fish preparatory to smoking
them, what receptacles should be used, and
how should the fish be placed in them? (2)
How much salt to use?— 39os.
(1) Use wooden tubs or tanks. The fish
should be laid out perfectly flat, 'with the backs
down, in regular tiers, with a layer of salt
on the bottom and between each layer of
fish. Care must be taken in the laying-out
of the fish, because the shape of the final
product will be governed largely by the shape
given it in the pickle. (2) The amount of
salt must be governed by the requirements
of the local market, the season, and the
period for which the product is to be pre-
served. A lightly salted fish smokes best.
What causes sneezing, and what happens
within the nose when one sneezes ?- —3870.
Sneezing is caused by irritation of the
mucous membrane of the nose. The stimu-
lus is conveyed by the trigeminal to the
medulla, where it induces a reflex act of
respiration. The act consists of a quick
inspiration followed by a violent expiration,

Is it true that Vincent Wallace received
the inspiration for '‘Beenes That Are Bright-
est” in “ Maritana ” when contemplating
Sydney Harbor?— 3Bo3.
Not" very likely. Wallace had his last
view of Sydney in 1837 or 1838- He wrote
the score of “Maritana” in London in 1845,
and in the meantime, had been in M.L., the
East Indies, India, South America and the

How does Rabdul get its water supply?—
3909.
Tank storage from roof collections consti-

being obtained during the dry season from
ground wells collecting seepage water. Water
from these wells has to be sterilised. Means
of improving the supply are being considered.

MEN AMONG
PEARLS
By
H. Drake-Brochman.
Synopsis : Christopher Kent, a young
English aristocrat, who has been
turned down by his cousin Lettice on
account of his poverty, comes to the
Broome pearling grounds, hoping to
make quick money and return to her.
June Goer, daughter of another
pearler, arrives from Melbourne, where
she has been living, and is greatly in-
terested in Chris; but it is young
Peter Fordyce, a wealthy pearler, and
not Chris, who is interested in June.
June makes a friend of Queenie, a
girl of her own age, about whom there
is some mystery. Chris's boat stays
out over Christmas, but at last he
comes in for the Lay-up. June is
delighted with the bustle and move-
ment, and to see so much of Chris;
she does not realise that he is inter-
ested only in her resemblance to Let-
tice. A letter from Lettice brightens
Chris, but he fails to notice her refer-
ences to a new male friend. Going
out with his crew, they come among a
number of diamond fish; Hashimoto,
his diver, refuses to go to work that
day —“ di’mond,” he says, “is verry bad
devil,” who brings ill-luck.
CHAPTER X {Continued) .
THE following dawn discovered him still
restless. Round and round the tiny
decks he prowled, scanning the swishing
grey sea. He stood muttering to the
tender. He was over-meticulous in his
attention to clothing. Chris fancied he still
felt reluctant to go below, but offered no
comment. A day wasted already! Strange
that the little fellow should be so put out
over a few rays. Chris also raked the ocean
with his eyes, but there was nothing—only
tossing seas and lightening skies, a dawn
the same as any other.
Hashimoto, dressed at last, shambled to
the ladder and disappeared into the waves.
Down through colorless walls he sank, into
the strange fantastic world wherein he
worked. Fathoms down: five, ten, fifteen.
It was deep here; during the night they had
drifted.
For a while Hashimoto let himself be
trailed whilst his quick eyes scanned the sea-
floor, lightening as the rays of the sun came
slanting down, curiously diffused and cold.
Color was born. Lovely greens and shim-
mering blues—a whole landscape—took
form; verdant fields climbing to steep gul-
lies, rising to hills that melted away in the
distance. Fish swam past like phantoms
till, turning, their bellies glinted like silver
spoons; sea-weeds and grasses waved and
trembled in the current.
The diver, towed across fairyland, back,
' as it were, on familiar ground, stopped peer-
ing around and fixed his whole attention on
the sea-floor. They must have drifted far.
He had been working on a sandy bottom
before, good for shell, but not productive
of pearls. Hashimoto cursed softly to him-
self : he did not care about the gems, he
only wanted to get his take up and draw a
substantial cheque—he was hoping to go
home next Lay-up. And oyster-shells were
not so readily picked out from a rock bot-
tom, so overgrown with seaweeds and
marine life they were.
He tugged at the lifeline, sank to the
floor and went trudging away up the gul-
lies, stooping and spying for shell. Far
above, like a following cloud, hovered the
shadow of his boat.
Often the tiny eddy caused by the sudden
closing of an oyster would draw his atten-
tion to a clump of weed, and the shell,
which might easily have been missed had
it remained open, would find its way into
his string bag. But he was still nervous, his
attention easily distracted. He kept looking
up, went cautiously round rocks, started at
the least disturbance in the water; and the
slim naked hands feeling for their prey were
singularly without confidence. Once he shut
off the escape and rose up a fathom for no
reason at all. Then, disgusted by his own
jumpiness, he returned and went on down,
down, down a sloping valley into ever-
greater depths. He was caught by a swift
current. Pieces of weed went swirling past;
but a good patch, fifteen shell or so all close
together, claimed his attention. He decided
to gather those and then go up for a spell—
his bag would be full, at any rate. He would
have to rise slowly; he had come down a
long hill and must be in very deep waters.
The little Jap went down on his knees
among the sea growths, and seized his bag.
Suddenly his heart contracted, leapt in
his chest. A dark shadow floated above!
He glanced up, but a diver’s helmet is not
made for upward glances—he could only
sense that ominous shadow of some wide
and sinister shape nosing close overhead.
He drew in his breath sharply. The shell-
bag slipped from his fingers as, with a will
of their own quite distinct from the work-
ings of his mind, they leapt to the air-
valves. A twist, a turn, the bubbles rising
through the sunny waters were shut off, the
diver’s suit expanded like a blown football,
lifeline and hose hung slack as up shot the
grotesque figure, whilst many feet below a
huge dark hank of seaweed slithered aim-
lessly away!
Chris, lying in his bunk waiting for break-
fast, was roused by the voice of the tender
raised in a shrill torrent of words. He went
above at once and discovered the agitated
Jap hauling in a great slack of line and call-
ing frenziedly to the engine-boy. The rest
of the crew was crowding round, jabbering.
The next moment the diver appeared,
bobbing helplessly in the wake.
“What’s the fuss?” demanded Chris.
“Too quick feller, boss,” screamed the
tender, his eyes rolling till the whites glist-
ened. “Hashimoto come up—so!” He gesti-
culated with a sweep of his arm.
The chattering quietened. A dreadful
silence, broken only by the curt orders of
the tender, settled on the group of men on
the lugger as the ungainly form of the diver
was hauled in to the side.
“He down very deep,” went on the tender
to Chris. “He come up—so! He fright-
ened feller. Might-be he catch’m trouble.”
Chris stood motionless, watching. A
little chill sent his flesh rough, a fear com-
municated by the thoughts so obviously
jostling the minds of his crew. Did Hashi-
moto really look more lifeless than usual,
or was it only his imagination? He strained
forward waiting to see,a brown hand, the
only human thing about that fantastic form,
reach up for assistance. But no hand came.
Chris shoved aside two of.the men and him-
self helped to drag the clumsy heavy
creature aboard. Limp it lay ; and, cold now
with horror, Chris stared fascinated at brown
fingers twisted and unnatural.
It had happened. The very worst thing
that could befall—Hashimoto was para-
lysed! Chris knew it, just as the men did,
before ever the helmet was off and they all
stared down, touched to silence, at an ash-
grey shrunken face, at closed eyes.
“Him verry bad,” muttered the tender.
Chris ran for the brandy he kept.
The lugger’s bows were swung round for
Broome, by the boss’s immediate order.
Then the tender stood up and shook his
head.
Chris understood little about paralysis,
but he knew that the hospital possessed a
miraculous machine for saving the little
Japs from the merciless grip of this Old
Man of the Sea. The decompressor, they
called it—a thing like a torpedo, into which
they could put a man and regulate the air-
pressure until at last he was released from
bonds which crushed him as invisibly as the
iron bands of fairytale wizardry. If the
southerly wind held, Chris thought, they
could make the creek under fifty hours, and
Hashimoto would be saved.
But the tender said no, Hashimoto was
too bad. Might-be he die at once. The
only chance at all was to “stage” him.
“You savee,” replied Chris, desperate.
And he shuddered. Put the little chap back,
put back that lifeless form lying helpless
on the deck, into the sea, return its prey to
the monster! What a fool he was! Of
course they must do the best they could,
and the tender certainly knew more about it
than he did. Desperate straits called for
desperate remedies.
A sudden outcry recalled him to the group
round the diver. Hashimoto had opened his
eyes. He was conscious, but he could not
speak. They forced a drink of tinned milk
and brandy between his lips. They told
him what they must do. His eyes assented,
but their brilliant darkness glazed.
Tenderly as a mother dressing their babe,
they screwed him again into helmet and
breastplate, lowered him down, down, down
to the lonely world below whence he had
so precipitately departed. It made Chris
feel sick.
Hour after hour he paced the deck. He
tried not to think about the man hanging
beneath. The tender’s words had thrown
light on the possible reason of Hashimoto’s
foolhardiness.
“Him frightened feller, all ri’,” he told
Chris. “Along that one di’mon’ fish. They
devil all ri’. Hashimoto speak to me las’
night, he all-time dream. He want to go
home, he speak see wife, see piccapinny.
He want’m bad-feller see littlest boy he
not ever seen. He dream—all-times he 4ry
uncertain —and this was the result.
“I suppose he see big fish,” went on the
tender. “He come-up too damn quick-feller
with devil behind.”
Well, whether or no, it was the devil now,
thought Chris. The crew moped and told
each other tales of tragedy. The tender
kept on shaking his head. Chris cursed his
luck and endeavored to add up just what
his losses would be, even supposing Hashi-
moto recovered; but all the time, at the
back of his mind, he saw that pathetic
figure swinging alone in the depths beneath.
Hashimoto had suddenly become human
to him—he had a wife he loved, sons, a
little piccaninny he had never even seen.
Miles away in Japan his children were
probably playing—at pearl-divers, perhaps,
because of the brave and honorable father
who was making money for their education
in far-off Australia.
Presently Hashimoto was brought up for
another drink. He had lapsed back into
unconsciousness, but the milk revived him,
and this time he moved his lips, though no
words came.
“He get better, liT bit more better,”
chanted the tender. “Two hour not so far
down and might-be he all ri’.”
Chris’s hopes shot up. He could see an
improvement himself. Extraordinary busi-
ness, this—how a man could be paralysed
and unparalysed, as it were, if he could be
returned again to the same water-pressure
and have the weight gradually reduced.
Hashimoto was an old diver and a good
one—it was staggering that he should have
got himself into this condition; but he had
spent so long beneath the seas that per-
haps now they would be kind to him!
The next two hours passed more rapidly.
The Jap looked less ghastly on his next
respite, but he was obviously weaker. The
paralysis was lessening, but his heart flut-
tered weakly, and Chris, fingers on pulse,
chilled by the touch of cold flesh, felt all
his hopes oozing away. Hashimoto lay with
shut eyes and made no attempt to speak.
He looked up only once, up past the masts
at white clouds scudding across the warm
sky, before they replaced the helmet and
shut out the sunlight.
The afternoon waned. Over ten hours
now they had been “staging” the unfortu-
nate fellow.
Chris longed for some other lugger to
heave in sight. It was like being alone on
a death-ship; the crew had grown silent as
the day passed. The tender, always vigilant,
squatted on the platform; the chug of the
engine pump sounded like a giant heart
beating, beating, trying to pour life down
beneath the sea.
Not until the sun was dyeing the racing
clouds to scarlet would the tender pull in
the lifeline. Chris, though he wanted to be
quite sure, felt that he knew at once: that
outer husk of diving-dress covered another
husk. Hashimoto had slipped from his
coverings, was still wandering somewhere
beneath the waves in search of the spirit
world of his ancestors.
There lay the goggling helmet on the
deck, its great eyes flashing fire back to the
sun; there beside it, in a pool of red-flushed
water, lay the little diver, the flaming light
flickering with false life in wide-staring eyes
which would never now behold his littlest
one.
And there stood Christopher Kent staring
down at the body of his diver, sick with
sorrow for Hashimoto and for the death of
his own high hopes!
CHAPTER XI.
June and Peter.
In Broome June grew restless and intro-
spective.
The cool south-easterly winds had set the
social machinery of the port in motion
once more, but the girl sensed a certain
monotony. The same people, the same
houses, the same talk, only relieved by a
shuffle in friendships; for in some inexplic-
able manner several of last year’s deadly
enemies were now equally deadly allies. At
first June blamed others for her changed
attitude; but as daily she found her
thoughts centring more and more on the
hidden lives of those around her, and so
becoming less concerned with outward
actions, she 'decided that she alone must
be responsible for the alteration, forgetting,
in her youth and inexperience, how surely
the delicate tentacles of thought react to
environment. To her consternation, she
even found, drifting across her bright picture
of life, wisps of doubt, suspicions more
chilling than the mists which some mornings
wreathed in from the Indian Ocean. Reso-
lutely she dispersed them: the things which
happened to other people did not happen to
oneself. But one thing happened which
forced her to cast aside some of the flimsy
girlish veils of illusion in which she had
hitherto wrapped her emotions.
Peter Fordyce asked her to marry him.
go home, big di-
mon’ fish catch
him .... proper
muck-up!”
Been dreaming,
had he? That,
Chris thought,
would account for
the sharp cry
which had wakened
him during the
night. Those ’rays
had certainly un-
nerved the fellow,
superst it i ou s as
could be. He’d
gone below feeling
And that made June acknowledge at last,
though only in the secret recesses of her
own consciousness, that she wished to be
no man’s wife unless—unless that man was
Christopher Kent. Only then did she face
the little schemes and dodges she had prac-
tised during the Lay-up, by means of which
she might chance to meet him more fre-
quently: the trifling excuses; the way she
had used Peter to gain the' other man’s
presence; the way she had'Struggled not to
be for ever looking at him, waiting to feel
her heart jump at sound of his pleasant,
drawling voice, the way she was always
thinking of him now he had gone, dreaming
about him—dreams which made her half-
ashamed. She wanted Chris to kiss her,
to love her; she wanted—to be his wife.
Wife! The thought upset June. Of
course one would be married someday—
but not for ages. Yet here was Peter forc-
ing her, by his own imperious demands, to
admit to herself that already she cared for
another man sufficiently to make her both
restless and uncertain. It was ridiculous.
One didn’t want to be bothered with mar-
riage until one was twenty-three at least..
Peter Fordyce had bungled his proposal.
He just blurted it out like a fool one day
when he had June to himself for five
minutes. In his car, of all places. And he
knew at once from the girl’s face that he
had made a mistake. The worst of being so
deadly serious over anything that it made
you feel again just as if you were a kid
going to the dentist was that it generally
made a fool of you into the bargain.
It wasn’t at all difficult to make love
to any pretty girl who attracted you, and,
for that matter, flirting with June had been
easy enough. But this was different. How
could he live without telling her, how could
he look into her blue eyes and touch her
hands without speaking? And yet, when
a girl wouldn’t give you a chance, wouldn’t
any longer even flirt, what were you to do?
Peter was young and impatient. He felt
he should have waited; but the words
came tumbling to his lips in spite of him-
self. Mad words, he told himself bitterly,
sitting alone in his office: June was not like
the majority of girls he knew; even in
her most flippant moments she had a shy
way with her. Well, she had turned him
down the first time; but he wasn’t going
to despair. She was so young—he’d just
have to be patient: and next time he would
not be such an ass as to tell her he loved
her without making her realise what that
meant.
“Aren’t you going to marry Peter?” de-
manded Queenie of June when a week or
two had passed and Fordyce had been
conspicuous by his absence from Goer’s
bungalow.
June blushed; much to her annoyance.
“Perhaps he hasn’t asked me.”
“Tell me something else! Everyone in
Broome is ready to bet he has.”
“Well, then, I’m not. He’s a dear,
but”
“He’s an awful thrill, I think,” retorted
Queenie, lying back on her lounge and
swinging a shapely leg. “And quite well
off. All the girls here would be glad enough
of the chance.”
. “Well, you marry him, then,” laughed
June. “I’ll give you my blessing.”
“Oh, Peter the Perfect doesn’t like me.
And doesn’t like us being friends, either,”
she added with a sidelong glance at June.
“And, anyhow, I don’t particularly want
to get married and have to settle down—
yet.”
“Neither do I.”
“Oh, I don’t see why you shouldn’t. It’s
different for me.”
June looked at Queenie, looked away,
found her eyes drawn back to the vivid
mocking face, the roving eyes. How she
hated that expression! And yet whenever
it crossed Queenie’s face she could never
help staring; just as she could not help
the queer thoughts which stirred in the un-
explored byways of her mind when her
friend fell into one of these detestable
moods.
“Why?” she demanded.
“Oh, well, I don’t know—you’re rather
different, that’s all. I get lots of fun.”
Queenie hesitated. She must not go too
far; yet sometimes the desire to shock June
became well nigh irresistible, and the
feminine impulse to indulge in personalities
frequently grew almost strong enough to
over-ride the discretion of so young a
woman of the world.
She managed to hold her tongue; but
June’s curiosity might have led to further
questioning then and there had hot Captain
Goer chanced to descend upon them like a
willy-willy.
• “Girls,” he cried, “I’ve just done a
damned good stroke of business, and how
about a drink?” He kissed June, lent over
Queenie and tickled the swinging leg before
dragging her to her feet and setting off,
with an arm round the slender waist of
each girl, swinging them down the verandah
towards the ice-chest.
June missed Peter. It was all very well
to indulge in vague, delightful dreams of
Christopher Kent, of London, of all manner
of intriguing if nebulous futures; but when
Fordyce, having thrown her up against
reality, withdrew his attentions, June dis-
covered She missed him considerably more
than she expected. There were plenty of
other men, and she had numbers of friends

was denied to the majoi-ity of her acquaint-
ances. But it was a fear which added
zest to their friendship. And now, she told
herself with a sense of grievance, he had
been stupid enough to get too serious, and,
in the tiresome way men had, wasn’t pre-
pared to go on in the old pleasant way
as if nothing had happened.
Why couldn’t he? Instead, he appealed
extraordinarily indifferent, and passed long
idle hours up at the Magistrate’s. June,
for the first time conscious of the pro-
prietary rights a man’s declared admmation
invai-iably awakens in the object thereof,
had perforce to watch him squiring Mrs.
Tweedie and suffer that lady’s complacent
smii-k. All of which made the girl think
about a great many matters hitherto lightly
skimmed and quickly dismissed, whenever
her mind chanced upon them.
. What did she want from life?
For so long it had been desirable to be
grown-up, to have a good time. Mamage
and babies and responsibilities had been in-
definite ports on a far hoi'izon. You had
a' good time; then you got married and —
well, went on having a good time; accoi-d-
-ing to school-gii’l philosophy, a much better
time, for of course you manned the one
and only man for whom you were the One
and only girl. And now June found that
observation and fact compelled her to dis-
card such a charmingly simple theory.
Hadn’t her own mother run away—it was
sti-ange how she had not thought that
significant before, and it became hard to
reconcile the blurred memories of a be-
loved mummy with this newer vision of a
woman who abandoned her children and left
a, man who was, with all his faults, a most
indulgent fathei’, for somebody else. June
did not dare pursue that argument to its
bitter conclusion; she pushed it back into
the obscurity whence it had risen.
Then there was Uncle Monty: a pei’fect
darling, and yet.... And Mrs. Tweedie, who
was for ever regretting her concert career,
and ready to imagine the most unlikely
men were in love with her. And Mrs.
Smith, whom they all said had once been
so frightfully pretty, and who told the
women things about her husband which
must be shocking, because they always
dropped their voices and whispered; and
she was always tired out, too, through
nursing an ailing baby.
Yet, in spite of these and a crowd of
others, most of them hopeless failures in
June’s estimation, the majority of people
seemed happy enough. Fiercely the girl
told herself she would not be “happy
enough”; surely life was better than that! 1
She must be out of sorts to get so despon-
dent. Everything was really just as mar-
vellous as on that enchanted night when
she returned to Broome and for the first
time beheld Chi'istopher Kent standing on
the jetty. ■ Was that not an omen, so to
see and like the very look of him? Chris
June would start dreaming again.
And whilst his beloved fulfilled her slight
domestic duties and danced and played
tennis, all the time living in an imaginary
world far removed from the physical one
whei'ein she talked and smiled and was
nice to people, young Peter Fordyce worked
with a concentration which worried his
mother. It was not natural in him, for
Peter had always been as fond of play as
of work; he was capable, and, to a point,
exacting, but quite often he had been heard
to declare he’d rather be a beachcomber up
among the islands than a slave to routine.
He might have inherited his mother’s grey
eyes, her flashing smile, but his love of
freedom sprang from a host of gallant fore-
bears who had for ever pushed out to the
edges of civilisation; the same urge, fifty
years before, had sent his father venturing
into unknown northern seas. So now Peter
applied himself with singleness of purpose
to the matui-ing of a pi-oject he had long
since conceived but hitherto only, as he
put it, played about with. He had to do
something; he meant to fan June’s fi’iend-
liness to a much warmer reaction, and, with
a wisdom born of his first rebuff, he felt he
must at all costs tread softly.
He possessed no inkling of June’s interest
in Kent, or he might have acted differently.
As it was, he simply had to check the
rising blast of a passion which threatened
to hurl him roughly forward. If he could
not make love to her, he would not see
her. It was agony to keep silent, to watch
her so sweetly being all things to all people
when he wanted her to be everything to
him. He had no intention of degrading his
emotion in the bars, like so many fellows;
and so he worked.
For some time past he had been sounding
pearlers on the subject of his pi-oposed
scheme for pooling the pearl-shell and
getting a guaranteed standard price per
ton : an action which might, of course, end
up in limiting production, but on the other
hand, should ensure a living for the one-
boat man. Whether the small pearler made
more than wages would depend on his luck
with pearls; but now too many were financ-
ing their boats by “dummying,” as the
white man’s practice of lending his name,
for a consideration or a part share, to either
Jap or Chinaman, was called. The law of
Australia prohibited the holding of pearling
licenses by Asiatics; but it was surprising
how difficult it was, notwithstanding con-
stant talk of the abuse of dummying, to
put a finger on one authentic case. For-
dyee thought that if only one or two
master-pearlers like Goer could be per-
suaded to approve of his plan, the matter
might be arranged and the industry put
on a sounder basis than ever before, be-
cause, however much a man might go pearl-
ing with the intention of finding pearls, his
bread and butter undoubtedly depended on
his shell-take.
There was soon a great deal of talk. Some
said it was all very well for young Peter
to put up the scheme, but just look how it
would benefit him! Fordyce didn’t deny
that; the agents for other overseas shell-
buyers would mostly be forced out of action
if the pearlers decided to sell only to the
American firm for which Fordyce and Sons
bought, because he would need to offer a
high percentage of contracts before his firm
would consent to guarantee. In fact, he
said, he wanted to get evei-ybody, and it
was absolutely essential for the big men
to come in.
The opposition and uncharitable remarks
galled Peter considei-ably. “Why can’t the
idiots see it’s for their good as much as
mine?” he asked. “We’ll all be l'uined if
this constant higher lifting of the payment
to divers goes on. They’re strangling the
industry. And there is a damned sight
too much dummying, though no one ever
seems sure enough, or game enough, to
import a case and get the law on to it.”
Peter fumed in this way to Mr. Mont-
gomery. He had taken to blowing into
Monty’s office neax-ly eveiy day. He knew
how Monty adored June; sometimes he
talked about her, and Sometimes a glow-
ing young creatm-e in white linen, blue
eyes dancing beneath a blue sunshade, would
come in whilst he was there.
Monty blew out a cloud of smoke. “And
I’ll be ruined if you succeed, young feller-
me-lad. You’re a nice sort of chap, I
must say, to come here and expect me to
applaud.”
“Oh, go on, Monty! You know very
well that I come to you because you’re
about the only man I can expect to see
I’m not entii-ely on the make. Of course
it’ll be good business for me. But you
know jolly well that if they won’t do
something like this the whole place will
rot. I hate ‘knocking’ you—why the hell
you and Dad didn’t get into partnei-ship
beats me. I’d like to tell you the whole
scheme and get your advice, but I can’t
because you’d have to cable off instanter
to London what my crowd are doing in
New York!”
Partnei’ship, thought Mr. Montgomei-y!
Had old Johnny ever said anything to
Peter? But, of course not; Peter couldn’t
have been more than ten or eleven when
his father was drowned.
He wondei-ed what the lad would say if
he told him now that his dad had indeed
suggested an amalgamation but that he
himself had turned it down for no other
reason than that, in the first yeai-s of his
sojourn in Bi-oome, he had found it easier
not to see too much of Sophie Fordyce,
who never had eyes for any man but her
husband. Well, Peter hadn’t even been
born then; and yet here he was putting
foi-wai-d a scheme, mooted often enough
befoi-e, but for the first time looking as if
young enthusiasm and determination might
bi’ing it to fruition.
“H’m,” said Monty, “It would be handy
if you would. But you’re on the right
track, me lad. Of course I’ll fight you for
all I’m worth. Must do —noblesse oblige
and all the rest, not to mention my own
income.”
“It’s certainly rough on one or two, but
I’m not losing any sleep over you, Monty!
You must be worth a pot. And, anyhow,
you can go on buying pearls. The pity is
that we can’t amalgamate. We’d carry all
before us if we could. But at least I
promise you’ll see some interesting develop-
ments before the month is out. So long,
or shall I di-ive you down to the post
office to send off the latest bulletin to the
enemy?”
“No, thanks,” retoi'ted Mr. Montgomery.
“I am not yet desirous of a trip to the
cemetery. And as I anticipate a visit from
June, and know you are not responsible
for your actions whenever you set eyes
on her”
He. did not finish the sentence. Fordyce
clapped hands to his ears and leapt down
the steps to his car. Of course it didn’t
matter, but he hoped other eyes were not
so sharp as Monty’s.
Mr. Montgomery chuckled. The more
he saw of Peter the more he liked him.
But June’s undoubted indifference was be-
coming a woi - ry. At first he had been glad
of it. He had looked upon her as a child;
it seemed a pity for her to get mixed up
with life so soon. Besides, he did not
want her to spend her days in Broome
June could have a much wider world at
her feet, he thought with the pride of
affection, though she would have to get rid
of dad. But now he did not feel so cer-
tain. Peter looked like turning out a
winner. And the other fellow—little things
made him think June was more interested
there than she had any right to be. The
other fellow was too old for her, anyway.
This plan of Peter’s—it would certainly
put the old house of Montgomery out of
action if it went through. But it was a
sound plan, all the same. He smiled and
sucked at a dead pipe. Shrewd of the
youngster to pei'sist in getting his opinion
of it! Peter certainly had his father’s
engaging way with him.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Holt broke a run of bad luck as a
trainer by capturing the Tooronga Han-
dicap at Caulfield with Umbertana. For-
tune frowned on him in the early spring,
when Great Idea and Gallantic went
amiss and had to be thrown out of
training. After that it became simply
one darned tribulation after another. Dun-
can, chief jockey to the stable, was sus-
pended for three months, and substitute
horsemen did poorly with Holt’s prads. To
top it all, Dutcliie was injured on the railway
journey to Sydney, where she was to have
competed in the Adrian Knox Stakes, and
had to be destroyed. And the Umbertana
victory was barren of betting profit. Holt
slung a novice apprentice into the saddle and
allowed the Salatis gelding to go out at
20 to 1. Umbertana waited behind the
leaders until half-way down the straight and
then came on to win leisurely from Semitist,
who finished well to cut the unlucky Harry
Gavin out of second place.
There were several Oakleigh Plate and
Newmarket Handicap candidates in the
Tooronga Handicap field. Waterline, reported
to have galloped well on the private training
track of his owner at Dandenong, was next
in demand to the favorite, Green Moth, but
signally failed to justify such support.
Waterline looks to be a light of other days.
Salatis, the sire of Umbertana, landed a
Caulfield Futurity Stakes ten years ago; he
is by Shepherd King from that wonderful
mare Traquette. Having atoned handsomely
for recent failures, Umbertana will have to
be reckoned with in the autumn.
Harry Gabell and D. J. Price each led in
two winners at Caulfield. Gabell tobk the

Jaberoo; Price annexed the Anniversary
Handicap with' Flail and the second division
of the Koakaribb Trial with Vairon. J. M.
Niall, of the V.R.C. committee, has rather a
fondness for jumpers and must be pleased
at the manner in which Whurlic is develop-
ing as a hurdler. Whurlic is by Whittier
from Ansonia, who produced the queerly
named Srgj to St. Anton.
In his long career as a trainer D. J.
Price handled such great performers as
Machine Gun, Pink ’Un, Mediterranean,
Bribery, Midnight Sun and Royal Scotch.
Of late years Balmerino (Caulfield Guineas)
and Vauntry (Maribyrnong Plate) have kept
him in the limelight. Price owns Flail and
made a killing with the little gelding in the
Anniversary Handicap. Because of having
run Calmond to a head in the Bagot Handi-
cap on New Year’s Day, Wilts went out
favorite, with Eric Connolly’s Dark Man
next in request. Neither of these neddies
was dangerous at any stage. Flail took con-
trol at the half-mile and romped home four
lengths in advance of the Westralian mare
Beaunilly, with Cupidity only a head farther
off. Flail is by Comedy King from Switch,
a mare who did good service for C. T. Godby
on the turf. Price’s other winner, Vairon,
belongs to F. W. Kitchen, president of the
Vic. Chamber of Manufacturers; he is by
Silvius from the dam of Ibrani and cost only
100 guineas as a yearling.
No man was more surprised than J. E.
Smedley when Blue Chequer accounted for
a dozen rivals in the first division of the
Rowena Welter. He fancied the grey so
l(ttle that odds of 20 to 1 went begging.
The son of Chrysolaus secured control in the
straight and lasted long enough to defeat the
hot favorite, Pembroke, by a head. As a sop
for steeplechases being barred at Caulfield
during the summer months, only cross-
country jockeys were permitted to ride in
the Rowena Welter. Bob Inkson had tlie
mount on Pembroke, and that helped to make
the Limond gelding such a warm fancy. It
cost Jaberoo small effort to land the second
division. He and Equatorial (Holiday
Stakes) were the only winning favorites in
eight events, and McShortodds, as happens so
frequently, went home laden with surplus
bullion.
* * * *
The A.J.C. had a dismal day for the open-
ing of its Anniversary meeting at Randwick.
There had been rain the previous night, and
it continued most of the morning and all
the afternoon. The premier club is singu-
larly unlucky in the matter of weather. The
crowd was small and dejected, and —as
generally happens on these occasions—most
of the races were processions.
Vista, favorite (at 3 to 1) for the Bondi
Handicap, was not troubled by the going.
He hit the front early, and was not after-
wards headed. He is a little fellow, but is
built on sturdier lines than Roman Spear
(4 to 1), who found Bst. 121 b. too much of
a burden with the track in such a state.
However, she struggled on gallantly in
second place, and it wasn’t a bad trial for
the Adrian Knox Stakes, in which she will
have 7lb. off her back. Dame Moab was
third; Lady Silvius sadly disappointed her
numerous supporters.
Lady Silvius is a daughter of Maltgilla,
who in four seasons threw this filly, Bur-
wood, Tregilla and Leila Vale—all winners,
and two of them rattling good horses. Other
stud matrons who are showing consistency
are Varta Mozzle, dam of Ivuvera and
Shakuni, and Lero, dam of Bronze Hawk
and Air Queen. Air Queen won at War-
wick Farm, and went out favorite for the
Widden Handicap. She ran pretty well, but
was beaten into third place by two light-
weights, Frimsel (9 to 2) and High. Frim-
sel is owned and trained by H. B. Lorigan,
and was bred in Maoriland, where Lorigan
comes from, being by Grand Knight—
Rachel. On Friday several Grand Knight
youngsters were put up at the Maoriland
yearling sales. Had Frimsel’s' victory pre-
ceded the sales it would have made a differ-
ence to the owner of the sire.
Gloriole has been retired to the stud, but
E. F. Walker has just as fast a horse in
his stable in her three-year-old brother, Cap-
tivation. The conditions obviously favoring
the gelded son of Heroic —Gloaming’s Sister,
he was a 6-to-4 favorite for the Challenge
Stakes. Tom Pinch (7 to 1) made a heroic
effort to lead all the way. It was too muqh
for him with 9st. 61b. on such a track, but
he took some shaking off; then Kichaka (10
to 1), who had accomplished this feat, had
to withstand a challenge from Captivation.
He battled it out so resolutely that Bartle
had to ride the favorite all he knew. Whit-
tingham flashed up on the outside when
Captivation had got his head in front of
Kichaka, and finished a close third; the
judge made it half a neck and half a head.
A most interesting race, run in slick time
considering the circumstances —lmin. 15sec.
Tom Pinch was a good fourth. A lot of
money went on Maybe, but he ran as most
Magpies do in heavy going; it is the one
weakness of the breed.
* * * *
January Handicap running is generally
regarded as a pretty good guide to the result
of the Anniversary Handicap. It is unlikely
to be the case this year. Rosendo (12 to
1), who won—thanks largely to Parsons’s
riding and a light weight—is not in the
Anniversary, and Topical (7 to.l), the
runner-up, didn’t come home well enough to
suggest success over the longer distance.
Cherbourg struggled into third place, four
lengths behind Topical. They were a very
tired lot at the end of the journey, which
was run in 2min. lljsee. Miss Nottava and
Inducement shaped indifferently, and Pavi-
lion walked in—the saddle slipped.
Rosendo divs. for 10s. were £7 13s. 6d.
and £3 7s. Good but backers who toted
Merrvland for the’ January Handicap got
115 7s and £4 3.s though the mare was
at 16 to 1 in the ring. She has had three

.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Melbourne’s Bonny Muir was decidedly
superior to Leon Labriola. another fourteen-
Stoner, at Leichhardt. With a short-arm
scissors hold he pinned his opponent in the
second round, and treated the Italian very
unceremoniously in the third. Just when
Labriola looked like beipg beaten in the
fourth, however, standing over-arm head-
locks upset the Aussie about six times, and
a body-press made the falls even. Musso-
lini’s countryman pulled the referee down in
the fifth, most of which was devoted to buf-
foonery, with all three mixed up on the mat.
Muir wasted no time in the sixth, and with
a series of flying tackles scored the deciding
fall. He could obviously have ended it
earlier, but it is a union rule that the crowd
must get its money’s worth.

bered dimly from something Jerome K.

Though the outfield was heavy after rain,
the wicket in the match between the English
Eleven and Victorian Country at Ballarat
had been covered and was in good condition
on Saturday; but rain spoilt things on Mon-
day. The home side did well to dismiss a fairly
strong team of the visitors for 255, Pataudi
topscoring with 84, while Leyland hit hard
for 62. The “Country” team included Alex-
ander and Bromley, from Melbourne, but the
former’s fast bowling proved ineffectual.
Stalker, a local bowler, showed fine form,
dismissing Jardine, Allen, Pataudi and Duck-
worth for 62.

“S. Gumm”: One would think from all the
mush that has been written about that Adel-
aide match that batsmen had never been hurt
before. Have we forgotten the case of
Tyldesley, who was hit on the head in a
Test match in England and carried off the
field unconscious? Have we forgotten our
own Sammy Woods, who, after rattling the
thighs and ribs of a scared batsman,
politely asked, before beginning his next
delivery, “Will you have it over the head
or over the heart?” This season we haye
seen famous internationals bowled neck and
crop by perfectly straight balls which they
made no attempt to play—and it wasn’t
a pretty sight. Another of our fellows has
been praised for “standing up to the fierce
battery when his back and shoulders were
a mass of bruises.” Why his back? The
balls that hit Woodfull and Oldfield were
bowled on the wicket l n the second inn-
mgs Woodfull batted for nearly four hours,
during which Larwood bowled 114 balls and
Voce 24 without being struck once. The
fact is that batsmen have been pampered so
much and so long that they have come to
regard themselves as being entitled to have
things all their own way If a method of
bowling which threatens the supremacy of
the bat is to be vetoed or restricted as a
matter of course, cricket is doomed.

“Old Q.”: Though frequently urged to do
so , both R ie .S.W. and Victorian Cricket
Associations persist in their attitude that
it is impracticable to reserve seats for inter-
national and other big matches. Queensland
characteristically solved the problem by re-
serving seats for the first cricket Test played
in Brisbane against Chapman’s side, and
made a great success of it. A similar policy
succeeded when the British Rugby Union
team played in Brisbane, and now reserva-
tions are being made for the fourth Test
against the Jardinians. The first plan for
700 seats was filled in a couple of days, and
another 400 have been set aside. Probably
a further extension will be made,

Vic. swimming championship over that dis-
tance, his figures being smin. 17 l-ssecs. The

“Shell”: Of late years N.S.W. has bulked
big in amateur sculling, though from J. J.
Daley’s first win for Ma in 1899 down to
Pearce’s appearance in 1927, Victoria, Tassy
and Queensland generally lifted the title
among them. Westralia has won once, in
1897, while South Australia has never man-
aged to click. Since Pearce took charge
N.S.W. has produced winners of the calibre
of Goulding, Scott and Turner. All, like
Pearce, are still on the active list and com-
pose probably the best quartette of amateur
scullers in the world.

Ins and Outs
The third Test between England and Aus-
tralia at Adelaide will go down in cricket
history as one of the most eventful of the
long series. This not so much because Eng-
land won hands down, but because the ill-
feeling consequent on the exploitation of
leg-theory led to ugly scenes, and prompted
the Board of Control to take the unprece-
dented and thoroughly asinine step of cabling
a p'rotest against ‘‘body-line” bowling to
the Marylebone club. As might have been
expected, this action has set the English
cricket world buzzing with resentment, and
another blow has been struck at the so-called
amicable relations which these internationai
contests are supposed to foster. Turning
to the cricket side of it, the match was re-
markable for the predominance of the bowl-
ing on both sides with the easiest of Wickets
to operate upon. This statement needs
qualification as far as the Australian trund-
ling is concerned, but generally holds, good.
Though some of- the finest batsmen in the
world were playing, not one managed to
reach three figures.
England’s second innings yielded 412 runs,
giving the visitors a lead of 531. Sut-
cliffe’s early dismissal for 6 started Aus-
tralian hopes that were not fulfilled. Jar-
dine (56), Wyatt (49), Hammond (85),
Leyland (42), Ames (60) and Verity (40)
fairly wore down the Australian bowling,
■which suffered considerably from dropped
catches, especially in the slips. Richard-
son “kept” creditably, but was naturally
inferior to Oldfield. O’Reilly (4-79) and
Ironmonger (3-87) bowled well against the
stubborn defence. Grimmett (1-74) again
suffered from missed chances.
With Australia facing a paralysing total
in the last innings of the match, optimists
got their first shock when Fingleton went
for a duck to Larwood. Ponsford departed
after scoring 3 (Larwood dismissed both
without a leg field), and a good stand by
Woodfull and Bradman ended when the latter
threw his wicket away by wild hitting when
he had reached 66 in a confident style. After
a stand for 21 by Richardson, who was not
at his best, the tail flopped, and the score
ended at 193, with Woodfull 73 not out.
Oldfield will be unavailable for the fourth
Test in Brisbane and it is hoped that the
clever young Victorian ’keeper, Barnett, will
get a chance. Another batsman is badly
needed, and Nitsclike or Bromley may be ?
chosen. The Queensland all-rounder, Oxen-
ham, is also a possibility.
« * # St
‘‘Stand Fast”: Every level-headed Aus-
tralian, even those who have backed the
Board of Control in the past, will deplore
its hysterical action in cabling to the Maryle-
bone club protesting against Larwood’s bowl-
ing. Apart from the pusillanimity of the
complaint, it is utterly unnecessary, just as
any action on it by the M.C.C. is quite out
of the question. The laws of cricket already
provide means of dealing with the prac-
tice—if it is illegal, which is extremely
doubtful. Law 43 says emphatically “The
umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair
play”; hence they are fully empowered
to deal with offenders. It may be said that
interference by the umpires in such a case
would create a new precedent. What of that?
In any case it would be a legali one, and
what more does anyone want?
* $ ❖ ❖
“Canvasser”: With.all this fuss about the
dangers of the English fast bowling, it may
be comforting to dependants of the Austra-
lian batsmen to know that all the players are
insured against injury by the Board of Con-
trol. The policies provide £5OO for a fatality,
£6 a week, for not more than 12 months, for
total temporary disablement, and £1 10s. a
week up to 12 months for temporary partial
disablement.
$ * £ $
“Amateur Pro”: When it was announced
that Mr. Wyatt, of the English Eleven, had
earned £5O by hitting sixes I trembled, like
others, for his amateur status. However,
it has been announced that these cricket
gratuities are to be pooled and whacked up
among all the players at the end of the
tour. The idea is in keeping with tlie best
ethics of communism, but does not settle
the question of the status.
*** . #
“Tenth Slip” : Australia has. lost a most
promising cricketer in Sid Hird, the Balmain
(N.S.W.) all-rounder, who goes to Rams-
bottom, the Lancashire League club which
vainly angled for Bradman and Grimmett.
A fine forcing bat and a really good leg-
break bowler, Hird is only 23, and Will be
unlucky if he does not make the Red Rose
eleven, as McDonald and some other Austra-
lians have done. He was a contemporary at
Balmain school with Archie Jackson, first
blossoming as a bowler. In the Sheffield
games, Hird has played 10 innings for an
average of 28.30, with a “highest” of 74.
He has taken 13 wickets for an avetage of
26.84. This season he showed well for
N.S.W. against England, making 15 and 9
and taking 6 wickets for 135.
* * * *
“Mugge”: The general astonishment that
Hammond should have been bowled by a
sugar-doodle full-pitcher from Bradman in
the third Test was ill founded. Every ex-
perienced cricketer knows that the absolutely
dud delivery is an almost infallible dismisser
of a well-set batsman. The principle is on
all fours with that generally accepted in the
old days of duelling with the small sword.
The expert hated worse than anything else
to meet an absolute neophyte. He could rely
on another expert, or even a practised
amateur, to adhere to the conventional
routine of carte, tierce and prime, but he
never knew what ghastly and unexpected
stunt the innocent would not put over him.
* * * *
“Inky”: Some of the amateur cricket jour-
nalists who have been spoiling clean paper
in the columns of the daily , press have con-
tributed some things rich and strange to
the vocabulary of the game. I am inclined
to award the damper to a well-known Syd-
ney professional man, who Was a good player
in his day. He has found it impos-
sible to shake off the medical complex,
and so his reference to Ponsford’s “psychical
instability” deserves to be emblazoned in let-
ters of gold as the journalistic gem of a
season which has been sparkling with them
like a bookmaker’s shirt-front.
* * ❖ *
“Five Ways”: The Queensland team to
meet Jardine and his merry men on February
4-8 includes abo. Gilbert and the schoolboy
bowler, Govan, who was dropped after a
promising showing in the first Sheffield game
against Victoria. It is explained that the
reason for not sending the youngster south
is that he is slow in the field. Gilbert’s
selection is dependent on another medical
examination, but if the darky is up to i his
form of a couple of season or sp he should
get some opening wickets cheap. He may
be tried out for the Country v. England
match at Toowoomba, played on February
1 and 2, but opinion favors his being reserved
for the State match. Archie Jackson will not
be playing, under medical advice.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cut Shot”: Considering that the visiting
American tennis-players are probably the
best all-round combination we have seen on
this side from overseas, not forgetting
Tilden’s team which retrieved the Davis Cup
in M.L. in 1920, Australia has not done so
badly in the four Tests. The Yanks won
31 rubbers, 84 sets and 748 games. Aus-
tralia’s tally was 15 rubbers, 84 sets, 654
games. The tourists have shown keen interest
in the younger Australian players and have
taken every opportunity of practising with
them, being of the opinion that they are
neglected in this respect by their seniors.
UNRECORDED SPORT INCIDENT.
The batsman who admitted he was out l.b.w.
“Rev. Knucklebone”: A couple of the tennis
stars provided an agreeable diversion during
the last Test match iu Sydney. A hot
service from Allison struck his doubles part-
ner, Van Ryn, on the back of the neck and
dropped him like a Larwooded Oldfield. Hop-
man, playing on the other side, rushed round
the net to render first aid, but the stricken
youth rose without assistance. Seeing that
all was well, - Hopman essayed an airy flight
over the net, but crashed like the favorite in
the opening hurdles at Randwick. The audi-
ence greatly appreciated the double and signi-
fied the fact with loud and ribald laughter.
* * * *
“Fitzcray” : The Victorian tennis authori-
ties have made the rather belated discovery
that members have been trafficking in their
tickets especially during the State cham-
pionships and the Test match with U.S.A.,
to the great hurt of the cash returns. They
are not alone in their sorrow. Every insti-
tution of a similar kind in Australia is
rooked by some of its members in the same
way, Sydney C.G. in particular. The tennis
heads are thinking out a way of squelching
what they describe as the “clever organisa-
tion” of the scalers.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: Norman Brookes has been de-
puted to “word” all the possible candidates
for a Davis Cup tour abroad, so it looks as
if an attempt will be made to ship a side
away this year. Crawford, Quist and
McGrath seem certainties, if available, and
the fourth man would probably be Hopman
if he were a starter. In his absence, the
picking of a fourth will be the puzzle. A
good doubles player to partner Crawford is
essential. Failing a shy at the Cup, it is
certain that we will send a No. 1 team to
Japan. We owe the Nipponese a visit.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: N.S.W. carried off both the
Linton Cup for Australian juniors at the
Australian tennis championships in Mel-
bourne and the Girls’ Challenge Cup as well.
The Ma State won 4 rubbers in the Linton
contest to 3 by South Australia, 2 by Vic-
toria and 1 by Queensland. Tassie did not
score a rubber.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Sandringham”: Save for club events, golf
is in the doldrums in Melbourne at present,
but most of the cracks continue to call atten-
tion to the fact that they are keeping their
eyes in. The two lefthanders H. L. Williams
and A. V. Rae are showing fine form. At
Victoria club, where he is on the plus 3
mark, Williams returned a card of 74, while
Rae, on a longer handicap, went round in
73, beating bv two strokes the score of W. L.
Hope, the leading English amateur, who was
playing his first game as a member of Yarra
Yarra club. 11. B. Anderson, the former
M L player, was also in form at Kingston
Heath with a score of 74, or a stroke outside
par, and one inside Mick Ryan s round.
“Hoylake” : The Prince of Wales’s candidly
democratic leanings have caused him to be-
come the object of a sort of supercilious
sympathy to the middle class. This feeling
lias now been happily dispelled by the fact
that) H.R H. returned a net 71 on the diffi-
cult Combe Hill course, winning the club’s
weekly medal. He has been coached by
Compston. who. it is confidently expected,
Will receive at least a knight-bachelorhood.
“Colonel Damurize”: These women are
distracting creatures. For some time past it
has been periodically announced that a
women’s team would visit Australia this
season, and, then that it wouldn’t. The last
communique further illustrates the contrari-
ness of the sex. Just as people like myself
were breathing sighs of relief that the pro-
posed visit was a washout, positive news has
come along to say that five of 'em will be
here in July, spending a fortnight in Maori-
land and six weeks in Australia. The whole
tour will last six months and will include
South Africa. Invitations have been sent to
15 of Britain’s best playerettes, and while
they are making up their minds as to whether
they will accept the invitation, and, if so,
,what they are going to wear, the British
selectbrines have toy heartfelt sympathy.
* * * «=
“Lakeside” : According to a recent cable,
Joe Kirkwood, Australia’s showman-golfer,
has struck out in a new line, Early this
month he was booked to start travelling
round the world on o.ne of the big steamship
tours which are so popular with Americans
and are welcomed by other peoples as im-
pressing the Yankees,with the fact that the
globe contains other countries than the land
of the three balls. Joe will act as golf
instructor to passengers desiring his ser-
vices, and, in addition, will beguile the mono-
tony of seasickness with exhibitions of his
famous trick golf. Whether his ark will
include Australia in her tour is not yet
known, but it is to be hoped so.
Car and Cycle
‘‘Formula”: The Monte .Carlo rally is being
conducted under slightly different conditions,
points being allotted for the different routes
not only for the mileage but for difficulties
surmounted. There arc 60 official itineraries
scheduled, live being from Great Britain.
The longest journey will be from Athens
—2352 getting .through on time
on this run will be worth' 1000 points. There
are the usual two classes, up to 1500 c.c.
and over, but on this occasion both classes
must maintain the same :speed schedule
throughout—24.B m.p.h.
* * * *
“Slinga” : Re the statement (B. 11/l/’33)
that the first motor-car appeared in Aus-
tralia in 1900, Major .T. Thomson, P.M.O.
of the Queensland Defence Force, had one
in IS9B. I was in hospital that year, and
he used to visit me by car. I most distinctly
remember Jock Thomson’s car striking the
gate-stop at Victoria Barracks, the clear-
ance being too small. That must have been
late in 1898 or early in 1899.
* * * *
“Scarface”: New British legislation pro-
vides that evety new motor vehicle fitted with
a screen must have it of unsplinterable glass.
This should mean greatly decreased mortality
in Britain, for of 1059 deaths due to motor
accidents during July and August last 42 p.c.
were motorists and only 33 p.c. pedestrians.
The safety glass consists of a sheet of cellu-
loid sandwiched between two pieces ot sheet
glass ‘ *
“Kick Starter” : Whether Australia is to
be represented in the Isle of Man Tourist
Trophy race this year depends on how soon
the British Autocycle Union comes along
with details of the assistance it can offer a
team. Last year the advices ran late, and
Pringle and Brewster only got there a short
time before the race, with little leisuie to
arrange for machines and get the hang -of the
tricky mountain course. At least five weeks
in England before the race is considered
imperative.
Miscellaneous
“Splash”: Lismore, in the N.S.W. Cow
Country, has been producing some good
swimmers of late, though they are not seen
often enough in the big stuff, the local expo-
nents being, probably, unable to spare the
time from the milking. One of them, R.
Stafford, managed to get away recently, and
in Brisbane won the Queensland champion-
ship over the half-mile in llmin. 42 4-ssec.
Stafford’s time was 3min. l-ssec. better than
the previous record by a Bananalander.
Australia’s best is lOmin. _ 22sec. by Charl-
ton, and the world’s lOmin. 20 3-ssec. by
American G. Crabbe.
* =i= * *
“»swan” : The race for the 16ft. open skiffs
championship of Australia, sailed on the
Swan River, was won by the Westralian
craft Marjorie, which was second in all three
heats, with a total of 21 points. The Queens-
lander, V-ictor 111., which won the first heat,
was third in the .second (won by Ronala)
and fourth in the third (won by Ajax), was
placed second on the point score with 19.
N.S.W. was also a starter with Swansea, but
was not in the picture. The Queenslander
had an unusual experience. She was un-
loaded from the Brisbane boat at Melbourne,
but absent-minded stevedores forgot to
load her on the outgoing ship for Westralia.
She got a later boat, and arrived just in time
for the contest.
* * * *
“Hotliam”: A worth-while point was
raised at a meeting of the Vic. A.A.A. when
W. H. McKinley condemned the prevailing
method of selecting athletes for the Olym-
piads on the grounds that State susceptibili-
ties were pandered to. This has been the
curse of sport and games of all kinds in
Australia, especially cricket, which, like
athletics, has an Australian-wide interest.
An athlete from the States outside N.S.W.
and Victoria has to be superhuman to catch
an Olympic tour, and, with the exception of
South' Australia, the same is true of cricket.
« * * *
“Black” : Horace Lindrum, nephew of the
mighty Walter, shows a capacity for snooker
which argues a misspent childhood —he is
only a pup. Playing in Sydney the other-
day, he potted every ball in one break with
a score of 139. The record break is sup-
posed to he 134 by M. O’Donoghue, of Maon-
land, but this was beaten by little Horace
in Melbourne in May last with 137. The
highest possible, apart from snookering the
other chap, is 147.

SAVE AND PROFIT
Piling shillings one upon another may be a form of thrift, but it is a
risky method—and unprofitable. There is loss of profit because the
same money, placed in a Commonwealth Savings Bank, would earn
interest. There is risk of loss by fire, by burglary, even by inadvertence,
and, not so obvious but quite definite, there is the risk of temptation
to spend.
The Savings Bank Account is the logical place for your savings, for
there they both accumulate and earn interest. Thus your saving power
is multiplied, your savings become profitable, and you are less tempted
to spend wastefully.

Distinguished Social Life.
The spirit of hospitality burns brightly in
the breast of Westralian J. L. Glick. Last
week he was host at a dinner to five or six
hundred, and one shudders to think how
many turkeys were slaughtered to make that
Y.A.L. holiday. For the dinner was primar-
ily a friendly greeting to J. J. Simons,
founder of the Y.A.L., and his visiting con-
tingent of girls. Somebody said there were
350 of these, but the stream of girlhood
passing into the lifts at David Jones’s was
so dazzling that this Letter gave up count-
ing after the first hundred.
The girls were a happy-looking lot, dressed
in the simple party frock of extreme youth
and in the flowing sophistication of the ’teens.
The young things walked down into the
restaurant and were marshalled to their
places ; apparently the girls of any one State
sat together at meat. This was handy when
community singing got started, and each
group was called on to pipe up its particular
song. The grown-ups waited about the audi-
torium greeting one another, and Mrs. A. E.
Joyner, who is chaperoning the Westralians,
and the Walter Kingsmill lady were soon
deep in talk.
The seats of the mighty were filled with
politicians and their wives, or so it seemed,
possibly because one of the important toasts
was that of “Parliament.” It wasn’t quite
in the picture with the company of round
cheeks and doves’ eyes to have sinister jokes
told about our rulers, such as the one
about the messenger who found a wallet
and restored it intact with the remark “But
it might have been found by one of the mem-
bers.”
Senator Walter Kingsmill and his lady
have been caught in a regular mealstrom
of congratulation over the New Year knight-
hood. It would take the whole Letter to
tell of the billies that boiled and the siphons
that fizzed in honor of the popular couple.
One of the most matey parties was the
wongi arranged by the Westralian Society,
of which the Senator’s lady is president.
This filled the Allora with Westralians,
and under the directing hand of Senator Oar-
roll’s wife they burst into' praise of the pair
who sat circled by friends, a glowing mass
of red gum blossom from King’s Park, Perth,
at their feet. Knight Hal Colebatch came
along to swing his censer, and in his remi-
niscences told a story of a member of the
Senate, of which Walter Kingsmill was
President. Called upon to withdraw an un-
parliamentary observation, the member did
so reluctantly, adding “but I will think it.”
“Ah,” said President Kingsmill soothingly,
“you may think what you please, I only
ask you to be careful what you say.”
Senator Walter in reply disclaimed any
personal merit for his progress in public life.
“I owe it all to my constituents. In my
first electorate they just elected me; they
never even asked me my politics. And
later on when another man went up from
Perth to oppose me, he returned and said,
‘What’s the good of sending anyone to stand
against that fellow? Why, up there they all
call him Walter!’” The new knight’s lady,
who added a neat little speech to the corro-
boree, wore Venetian-red georgettes thickly
sown with gold sequins and an old Italian
necklet and pendant of lapis-lazuli. Charles
Nathan and his lady and the dashing J. J.
Simons, founder of the Y.A.L., George Fitz-
patrick, of the Community Hospital, Mrs.
Goodisson, Vinia Deloitte, vivid in almond-
greens, pretty May Sheehan, in black velvet,
Mrs. John Burley, graceful in cosmos-pink
chiffons, and Mrs. Stephen Herford were
noted in the changing groups.
The Cafe de Fairfax was involved in an
accident on Friday night; and the “S. M.
Herald” gave it an imposing par. without
mentioning the most interesting things about
it. In nights long gone, when chorus ladies
were almost the only people who were taken
to after-theatre supper parties, the world
that felt hungry after 10 p.m. had to feed
itself at stalls, chiefly on “pies all hot and
saveloys.” Of all these stalls in Sydney
the best-known was the Cafe de Fairfax,
which set itself up outside the “S. M.
Herald” office; and when others disappeared
it stayed on, the last of its tribe, the supper-
room of the night workers in the Fairfax
establishment and the meeting-place of
Bohemians in general. On Friday night a
newfangled motor-car skidded and crashed
into the venerable institution, knocking out
one of Sister Olive’s front teeth (Sister
Olive has for 20 years drawn the ven. insti-
tution to and from its day-time rest to its
night-time orgies), and so flustered was the
old lady that she became hopelessly en-
tangled with the pigs’ feet. Probably for
the first time in this generation the cafe
had to suspend business for half an hour.
The Mutiny on. the Bounty being almost
ready for screening, the Charles Chauvels
are having a social fling. They gave a tea
party in the small drawing-room of the Aus-
tralia last week, when Mrs. Chauvel proved
herself as good a speaker as her energetic
husband. The lady’s large blue eyes must
be very observant, judging by the details of
Tahitian and Pitcairn life she retailed to
the company. The little hostess wore black
(it really is almost a uniform with the smart
frocker these days) ; Mrs. Bruxner, who. is
an aunt of Charles Chauvel, dropped in;
and Violet Roche helped with the enter-
taining.
Another of Australia’s splendid war nurses
has gone west. She was Sister Margaret
Gray, who served all through the war
in field stations and was decorated with the
Royal Red Cross. For nearly 13 years she
was matron at Cavell House, a rest home
for army and civilian nurses at Summer
Hill; previous to that she was matron at
Graythwaite convalescent hospital. A
touching feature of the funeral service was
the little group of war sisters who kept their
comrade company.
Mrs. Clarice Zander is an enterprising
Australian who has come back from Europe
with enough English art to furnish an exhi-
bition. This will include representative
works by Augustus John and Epstein as well
as other leading but less lime-lit painters
and sculptors. Epstein is rather a hard man
to nail down, so one night when Mrs.
Zander was at his house she said to him,
“Now, what will you let me have for my
Australian exhibition?” He replied, point-
ing, “Oh, I think you could have this, or
this.” The lady came back promptly with
“Very well; I’ll take them now.” And she
gathered them up and left the party at onc6,
for fear Epstein might change his mind. Mrs.
Zander should know what’s what in the
palette world, for she helped Jimmy
MacDonald, Art Director of our National
Gallery, to run the New Gallery in Mel-
bourne for five years.
Wal Taylor housed a cocktail and sherry
party for Mrs. Zander in his Grosvenor Gal-
lery last Friday. The lady is a flashing-
eyed brunette, and in spite of the warmth
wore a silver-grey fur with a strong family
likeness to Chinchilla across her shoulders.
Otherwise she was trigly black from tiny
shiny hat to English shoes. She knows more
about Art London of to-day than probably
anybody else in Australia —now that Will
Dyson is out of it. President of the Society
of Artists Syd Ure Smith came to the party,
as did Jimmy MacDonald, of the National
Gallery, Leon Gellert, and the blonde and
the dark Miss Tildesley. Hera Roberts, the

holiday with Eileen Bell, and Beryl Ross-
botham, slim and small, demonstrated the

that black was the ideal wear for the young
woman.
Here’s a pretty girl whose passage bright-
ened Sydney
last week. She
is Elvie Hill,
and her father
is S. Aus-
tralia’s Pre-
mier. The
family spent
a few days
with us on
their way
home from a
Tas. holiday.
The Adelaide
girl is not
satisfied to be
just a Pre-
mier’s daugh-
ter ; she’s a
fully - fledged
kin dergarten
teacher an d
has a school
of her own in
Adelaide. Falk

Lieutenant-Colonel Pratt and Mrs. Pratt
(they reft last week for England, where he
will join the Royal Tank Corps) were fare-
welled in style at the officers’ mess of the
17th Battalion in North Sydney. The
Colonel who was formerly director of Mili-
tary Art at the Royal Military College, gave
a lantern lecture on armored fighting
vehicles, and then the 80 or so present got
busy with jazz. The new director of the
college, Colonel Scobie, and his wife were
at the party.
Mrs. Hinkler, wife of the intrepid airman,
who is leaving Maoriland to join her hus-
band’s family in Queensland, there to await
further tidings, has the intense sympathy
of Sydney. Bert was one of the most popu-
lar airmen who ever winged his way across

way forother lone fliers.; and a more modest,
self-effacing little man it would_be W J
meet One sensed m him, amid all uie
tumult and shouting of the welcome cele
brations, the loneliness of a Napoleon and
there was something not unlike the little
Corsican in the concentrated gaze.
No less a person than the Premier came
along to propose the toast of the guests whe
the medical board of the Community H°s>P> -
tal lunched Senator Walter Kingsmill and
his popular wife. The two are keen sup-
porters of this movement to give the best
medical attention at prices to suit that lai«e
in-between class, the not very rich and the
not very poor. Romanos did the lunch
handsomely under the guiding eye of George
Fitzpatrick, and everything was just n»ni
from the iced rock melon to the ice pudding.
It was quite a big party and included
Italy’s, Belgium’s and Czechoslovakia s Con-
suls; Albert Gould, the first President of the
Senate, looked in to offer his felicitations
to a worthy successor. The Charles Nathans,
the Benjamin Fullers and the Bertie Lloyds
were there; the Commissioner of Police
brought Mrs. Childs; Dr. Fanny Reading,
looking very impressive, Arthur Rickard,
Mrs. Fitzpatrick, in an attractive black and
white outfit, Sister Kerven and Mrs. John
Eales were notables. The Kingsmill lady,
in a flowered silk frock,, the green of the
spring grass, sat between the director of the
hospital, D. M. Bourke, and Health Minister
Marr. Two down sat William Brooks, who
was responsible for the only story which
contained the great Australian adjective.
This is a Falk study of Senator Kings-
mill’s wife, around whom congratulatory
parties have
raged. One of
the happiest
was that
arranged by
the committee
of the Dal-
wood Home,
for which the
Kingsmills are
great workers.
Husband Wal-
ter wasn’t in
this morning
t e a-drinking,
which centred
in the lady,
and ended with
her carrying
off the frag-
rant loot of a
fair-sized gar-
den and a
fountain - pen
of such pro-
portions that one imagined it w-ould hold
serum enough for a three-volume novel.
A smart wedding of the week was that of
Wendy Palmer, of Mosman, and Lieut. Galfry
Gatacre, of the R.A.N. He is the second son
of the R. Gatacres, of Brisbane, and as flag-
lieutenant to Commodore Holbrook and
Admiral Dalglish was a great social success.
The Navy seemed to be taking a night off
for the wedding, and the Mosman Presby-
terian kirk was filled with the quarter-deck
importants, from Admiral Dalglish and his
wife down. The ’groom’s four supporters
were in full naval kit, as was the hero of
the hour, and really the male group proved
of almost as great interest to the staring
crowds as did the bride and her four ’maids,
flower-girl and small page.
A friend of The Bulletin finds herself
among the Friends :
Amongst the gentle-voiced Friends who recently
met in their centenary celebrations in Hobart was
the versatile Mrs. Margaret Watts (formerly Miss
Thorpe, of Welfare work in Sydney), who had some
amazing experiences in Europe in the first days of
healing the wounds of the Great War. Her speech,
brief, and to the point, at the Town Hall followed
that of the wife of an English delegate, Mrs. H.
Crossland, of Manchester. Mrs. Watts combined the
Quakerish mode of quiet colors with a demure
Sydney note in a smart light straw hat, with a
suggestion of a bonnet in its front rim, and a long
soft streamer ribbon that fell over the corsage of
her summer frock in up-to-date black.
Mrs. Crossland represents the plump and comely
British matron in her most peaceful moments. ' In
ringing accents she appealed to women to fight for
peace in perpetuity, and gave the League of Nations
a gentle motherly rap for not, so to speak, keeping
belligerents sitting in corners.
One of Sydney’s well-known Peace Society mem-
bers, William Cooper, took the chair at the Sunday
gathering, which ended, in Quaker fashion, with a
Silence pause. His fine old face, with lines of
benevolence and caution firmly engraved by Artist
Time, looks almost mid-Victorian in its detachment
from the . raucous to-day.
Mrs. Dowsett, of Wellington (M.L.), was another
delegate. Tall, pleasant, with a smile that. had
the real Friend’s expression, she wore well-cut
costumes varying from soft shades of brown to digres-
sions on Hobart’s odd warm days in lighter tones in
voile. The Quakeress, as one saw her in Tassie,
always gives something of a bonnet twist to the front
of her straw summer millinery.
Jim McGregor’s dinner to Lionel Lindsay,
who goes off by an Italian ship for another
look at Europe, was described to the writer
as magnificent. It was a stag affair—l 2
all told. Everybody was an enthusiast
about art in his own way, and a notable
among them was wine man Leo Buring,
an artist of the grape, so to speak. The
host, who is a connoisseur of art, gastrono-
mies, wool, literature and wine, set his
guests to meat in a room whose wall deco-
rations consist of graceful panelling. In
this way the taste of the palate was not
diverted by the fancy of the eye, which might
have happened anywhere else in a house
hung with Brangwyns, Lamberts, Bunnys
and the work of nearly every known Austra-
lian artist. The house is in a lovely spot
on Darling Point, and has a view from its
terraces right down to the Heads; also it
overlooks Carthona, where Earl Beauchamp
and his son Hugh are living till March.
The guest of the evening made a dramatic
entry. His taxi chugged up the drive late.
He sprang out, and in his hurry managed
to get his fingers clipped by the door, where-
upon he turned and, crying “Water, water,
water!” rushed into the house. Dr. Sinclair
Gillies, who was on the spot, sprang to
attention and so relieved the pain that
Lionel was not heard to cry “Water!” once
during the feast.
Sydney has four new girl doctors: Ida
Burchall, Estne Henry, Laura Spence and
Monica Donnolly. They were admitted by
knight William Cullen, Chancellor of the
Uni., within the Great Hall, and are now at
liberty, together with 39 new male doctors,
to go abroad seeking whom they may succor.
This city has a proud record in_ its women
doctors. For example, Dr. Constance D’Arey
can carve a patient as neatly as one could
wish. Then there is the great-hearted group
of medical women attached to that marvel-
lously efficient women’s hospital, the Rachel
Forster. There are Dr. Mary Burfitt and Dr.
Harriett Biffen and, on the north side, Dr.
Lucy Gullett. There’s Dr. Marjorie Little,
who, in addition to her private practice, is
honorary bacteriologist at Sydney Hospital;
while the Board of Health has for
pathologists Dr. Marie Hamilton and
Dr. Elsie Dalyell—the latter did mag-
nificent things in post-war Vienna for
the war babes of Central Europe. Here
she worked with the brilliant Dr. Harriet
Chick. This lady is now paying a visit to
Sydney, but when not hobnobbing with her
former colleague is retiring behind the veil
of modesty and the doors of the Macquarie
Club.
Bananaland bits: —
■ Sir Leslie Wilson paid his first visit to Coolan-
gatta and was welcomed by Mayor Graham ; Marjorie
Wilson was with her father. At Palm Beach a
guard of children, each holding a palm blanch, made
an archway for the visitors. Canon Garland did
the welcoming at the Rainbow Bay Rest Home for
Soldiers. The party looked in at the Anglican
Mission Camp, where 80 children are holidaying;
many of these kiddies from western Queensland are
having their first glimpse of the sea.
The C.W.A. Ball at Southport was held in the
Pier Theatre, when 20 debs, were presented to the
Governor and Lady Wilson. Rose petals were strewn
in their path by two wee flower-girls, Valmai Lahrs
and Phyllis Gibson. The Mayor and Mayoress (the
C. H. Steadmans) did the welcoming. Lady Wilson
was in petunia mousseline, Marjorie Wilson in sea-
green lace; Mrs. J. Remanons acted as matron of
honor. A silver vase with the Southport coat of
arms was set on the top of the deubtantes’ cake at
the vice-regal table, and was later presented to
Lady Wilson. There were some 500 present.
The Sisters of Mercy : had decorated the altar at
St. Stephen’s for the marriage of William Keys to
Eileen Agnes Hynes. The bride, who was given
away by her father, was in whiter satin with a silk
net Belgian embroidered veil. May and Kathleen
Hynes ’maided in sea-green organdie. The Jenolan
Caffe saw the feasting.
Countess Lyle de Yant is touring Australia and
visiting friends in N. Queensland.
Pianist Edward Cahill is going to England in
March.
John England married Irene Maud, daughter of the
W. Hardwicks, Wynnum. The bride was given away
by her brother, J. E. Hardwick; she wore white
mariette with tulle veil. Thyra and Jean Lewis
’maided in coral pink with silver lace Juliet caps ;
Dulcie Kenway was flower-girl in blue. The party
■was at the bride’s home and the Northern Rivers of
N.S.W. will see the ’moon.
Matron Cairns, from Gordonvale Hospital, is the
new matron at Thornborough College, Charters
Towers. She had two years on war service.
Henry Jacobs married Edith Larwill in the Eagle
Junction Congregational Church. The bride, who
was given away by her brother, was in chantilly
lace with a tulle veil. Gwende Grant ’maided in
salmon chiffon, and little Margaret Larwill was
trainbearer in ivory chiffon. Pink roses decked the
Canberra for the feast.
Barbara Thomson, who marries Thomas Sherman
this week, was ffeted by Erica Francis with a
tennis party at Cordelia, St. Lucia. The bride-
elect’s future home will be at Thursday Island.
Members of the A.I.F. who were quartered at
Enoggera before going on active service will hear
with genuine sorrow of the death of Mrs. Arthur
Vidgen, who was a good angel to so many, and
whose home fairly exuded hospitality and help for
the Digger. Her eldest son made the supreme
sacrifice in the war.

Chatter
The racing at Warrnambool was blessed
with fine weather, and the women of the
Western District were able to flaunt smart
frills and furbelows. Mrs. J. V. Fairbairn, of
Mount Elephant, sported coat and skirt of
cowslip-liued crepe flamisol with blouse of
ivory satin, topped by a silk crepe cap bor-
dered with a plait. Mrs. Keith Urquhart’s
tailor-made of silver-grey tweed was worn
with a turban of white rebouldingue. Daugh-
ter Mervie chose china-blue shantung with
a shady hat of the same hue. Mrs. John de
Little, of Muston House, wore a broad-
brimmed hat of green pedal straw with her
suit of tourmaline-green crepe roshanara.
Mrs. E. W. Powling, of Port Fairy, was in
black crepe de Chine, relieved with grey
silk lace. Mrs. E. B. Turnbridge, of Pens-
hurst, looked summery in faint pink silk with
a panama liat. Mrs. Ronald Cumming, of
Peterborough, was in granite-blue tweed and
her daughter Lorraine’s suit was navy ; with
them was Heather McKellar, all in brown.
Caramut House, the station home of Mrs.
Ernest de Little, was the scene of a dance
staged by the chatelaine’s nieces, June and
Mary Whitehead, and her nephew, Jamie
Affleck. Mrs. de Little, in dove-grey chiffon,
and Mrs. Whitehead, in blhck satin, helped
the youngsters to entertain the guests. June
Whitehead danced in parchment-tinted cire
satin; her sister Mary chose crepe madri-
lene, and the youngest of the Whitehead
girls, Pat, sported midnight-blue chiffon.
Among the older guests at a ball mainly for
the young were the Keith Urquliarts, Geof-
frey Streets, Gordon Chirnsides, Walford
Manifolds and Mrs. R. A. Affleck. Mrs.

at a dance at St. Kilda Town Hall, which
started off with speechifying by Mayor John-
son, of St. Kilda, A. G. Byrne, president of
the School Committees’ Association, and
Miss Hooton, who has charge of the visitors.
Among official guests were J. A. Jones,
president of the Old Westralians’ Association,
and his wife; Mrs. Martin, the hon. sec.,
and Mrs. Donald. During the evening there
was a presentation of prizes and the West-
ralian girls sang.
A charity bazaar in the garden of Dream-
thorpe, Macedon, the home of the Hodges

The Y.W.C.A. girls who were in camp at
Seaford during the Christmas holidays had
a reunion party the other night, at which
they told their, adventures to other members
who were not of the camp. General secre-
tary Irene Glasson presided, and there were
games and physical displays.
The Girl Guides, to the number of 230, in
caup at Jamberoo were visited by the Isaacs
lady, who is Federal president, and wore for

bury, took place at the Collins-street Baptist
Church. The leading lady was in pearl-
white mirore velvet, sleeved and trained, her
Limerick lace veil falling from a close-
fitting cap. She carried a posy of ffangi-
panni. She was attended by her sister Betty
and Violet Robinson, in deep orange chene
velvet, with large bows at the back of the
bodices and little tulle caps the same shade
as their gowns. After-rejoicings were staged
at No. 9.
.Joyce, daughter of Mrs. Robert Lindsay
and grand-daughter of baronet William
Clarke, made no change in her surname when
she was married in London last month, the
man of her choice being Martin, son of Mrs.
A. B, Lindsay, of Sussex, and the late
Colonel Lindsay. The bride wore vellum-
tinted velvet with a veil of old lace, and her
four maids were in velvet of the same hue
as worn by the bride, with red sashes and
wreaths of red roses. A quartette of pages
sported the Lindsay tartan. The elder Mrs.
Lindsay has a station in Westralia.
Devoid of fuss was the knot-tying, of Dr.

Our Education Department has been en-
deavoring to discover the tastes of school-
children in the matter of fiction, and has
obtained reports from the 75 schools which
last year participated in the Gillies Bequest
scheme. Diversity is the strong feature of
the result, 180 books being reported as
favorites. Among the very young ones
the Grimm fairy tales get a big vote;
there is no, mention of Hans Andersen.
“Arabian Nights” and “Robinson Crusoe”
are well up in the list. Boys still plump for
“Treasure Island” and “Tom Sawyer,” and
Rudyard Kipling will be glad to hear that
“Ju.st-so Stories,” the “Jungle Books,”
“Puck of Pook’s Hill” and “Rewards and
Fairies” are all popular. Nor are our
Australian authors neglected. M. G. Skipper’s
“Meeting Pool” appears on many lists, and
animal tales by E. S. Sorenson, Charles
Barrett, Amy Mack and May Gibbs receive
honorable mention. Donald McDonald’s
“Busli Boy’s Book” is a general favorite,
and the girls haven’t yet grown tired of
Ethel Turner’s “Seven Little Australians.”
Oddly enough, “Alice in Wonderland” isn’t
placed, and outside Mark Twain the only
American who commands a following is Joel
Chandler Harris for his “Uncle Remus”
stories.
Our former Governor, Lord Somers, has
come to spend a few weeks.liere in fulfilment

Residents of the tony stiburj) of Kew are
rediscovering that they have a railway
station, because it is being given an attrac-

Herbert Gibbs has presented the Perth Art
Gallery with “The Landing, of Vlaming at Cottesloe
Beach, 1697,” a painting in oils done by himself.
The inspiration of the picture was the convoy of
three Dutch shins searching the coast of New
Holland for the lost Ridderscha.p Van Holland, a
ship which never arrived at its destination. The
explorers marked “Rottenest” on their charts after
the hopping vats (wallabies) which swarmed upon
the island. After landing in the surf of the main-
land,;; they marched across the sandhills and dis-
covered a “large basin of brackish water,” now
known as Freshwater Bay. Mr. Gibbs, who has
passed his 80th milestone, is the father of May
Gibbs, of the Gum-nut Babies.

Adelaide events: —
The Test match was the one topic last week.
Margaret Smeaton and Bill Howard were married
at the St. Peter’s College Chapel on thei second day
of the niatch, but they most considerately made
the time 10.30 a.ni. so that the wedding guests
were able to get down to the Oval before noon.
There were visitors from everywhere and seldom
have the hotels reaped such a harvest. The Lieut.-
Governor and the Bishop of Adelaide are both keen
supporters of the game and were there for the
start of play morning after morning.
Mrs. J. Sangster, of St. Peters, is leaving for
England in March, and will possibly be away for

bookmakers’ jargon, for odds making bargain,”
unheard for so long, was once again a feature.
The Y.A.L. girls brought their smiling faces and
brown uniforms to Hobart and found time during

Biggar in a New Suit.
BY HAROLD MERCER.
YOU could get two pounds on that suit
if you pawned it,” ‘Bergman said.
Biggar, who had liardly dared hope
for success when he asked for credit, knew
that that was the tailor’s way of intimating
that, though he might be good-natured, he
wasn’t altogether a fool.
“I’m going to pawn it for more than two
quid—l’m going to raise prosperity on it!”
said Biggar, with his roaring laugh. “You’ll
see!”
Bergman gave a quick grunt, . which
warned Biggar not to carry out his inten-
tion to ask for a small loan. He had to be
content with emptying the largest tankard
in the bar at the little tailor’s expense;
after which he walked half-way across the
city to find Watt.
“I don’t mind a drink, but don’t talk
about money, old chap,” said Watt. “I’ve
forgotten what it means. I haven’t been
able to buy myself a suit.. of clothes for
over a year.” Biggar felt there was resent-
ment in the look he cast at the new raiment.
A little later Royston, an employer of
Biggar in one of his rare intervals of regu-
lar employment, was gazing intently at the
same apparel.
“You’re looking prosperous,” he said.
“Oh, this!” laughed Biggar. “The result
of cutting out the booze, Mr. Royston!”
One of Royston’s idiosyncrasies was a
hatred of liquor; he had once disagreed
heartily with the suggestion of Biggar that
drinking aids business. He had even said
that, if a drink was necessary, one might
take lemonade!
Biggar, however,, had use for Royston, and
mentioned that he had heard a couple of men
had dropped off Royston’s sales staff. “You
know I’m a salesman,” he added.
“Don’t know,” mused Royston, looking at
Biggar’s clothes. “In these times we feel
that any work that’s going ought,to be given
to those in urgent need of it.”
With a knowledge of the emptiness of
the pockets in his impressively new suit,
Biggar proceeded to convince Royston that
he needed a job, and needed it badly. Roy-
ston was one of those benevolent. men who
like applicants for employment to want work
badly, and be became interested.
“My wife,” said Biggar, smiling sentiment-
ally, “has always wanted me to take • a
steady job—‘four pounds a week, as long
as it’s certain,’ is what she says.”
“It’s not four pounds certain; it’s com-
mission,” said Royston sharply. “We can
only pay on results nowadays.”
“What expenses?”
“No expenses,” said Royston decisively.
“And no advance against commission.”
Biggar blew in upon me later in the day,
a little like a southerly buster that, has
blown itself out. “I’m starting in a job
to-morrow —a regular job; but I haven’t
a bean. You’ve got to let me have a dollar,”
he said.
“Talk sense,” I told him. “I haven’t got
half a dollar. I’m. dead up against it. And
I haven’t been able to buy myself a suit
of clothes for years.”
Biggar exploded ; which was a matter for
no surprise when he told me all about it.
Matters had become desperate. It was only
because they were desperate that he had
put it over Bergman for this suit.
“Bergman’s got my other rags—the good-
natured little devil promised to try to make
them decent,” he added; “if I’m not re-
spectably dressed, that wowser Royston
won’t put me on. A job’s a job, anyway,
even if it’s one in which you’ve got to tell
lies about beer.”
That was amusing, and I laughed; but
I was astonished to see Biggar, generally
so full of bluff and bluster, drop his head
in his hands; and the tears came as he
spoke.
“You’ve got to find me a few bob, old
man,” he said. “They’re starving at home,
and I can’t go back without anything. I
haven’t made a bean for two weeks; and
young Tom’s fifteen bob goes at once.”
All he told me, his head in his hands,
the bluster usually sustaining him broken
in a sense of abject failure, shocked me.
“But what about the dole?” I'asked.
It seemed a natural remark; I had no idea
that it would give. Biggar. such offence.
“I thought you were a friend of mine,”
he said stiffly.
“I’ve tried to be,” I retorted, nettled.
“Dammit, the dole’s there. There’s tons of
people taking it with less excuse than you
have.”
“I might have to take it,” he said fiercely,
“but I’ll fight to the last ditch before I do !”
It seemed ridiculous in a man with the
financial idiosyncrasies of Biggar; yet I
realised that it was in keeping with his
character. He was a man who fought for
existence, hated the idea of being spoon-fed.
Of course I had to do something for him;
so I sought out Patton, who sometimes
lends me money.
“We’ll have a drink,” I said to Biggar
afterwards, “but you hang on to this money.
It’s only a few bob, and you’ll need it all.”
“You’re a good sort,” lie said. “There’s
an idea in the dole, too, I think.”
I felt a sense of satisfaction. It hadn’t
been fair of Biggar to fall upon me.
“That’s right ; be sensible and take what’s
going,” I said.
“I’m not talking about taking it,” he
answered; “but there ought to be some
scheme of making money in it.”
I faced him suddenly. “For God’s sake
stop your scheme!” I said. “You’ve got a
regular job, haven’t you?”
“Oh, yes; but only commission,” he re-
turned in a fashion that caused me mis-
giving. I had strong personal reasons for
wanting to see Biggar in a job that was
certain.
Biggar’s buoyancy returned quickly. The
sense of relief that even a few shillings
gave him must have helped. Reminded by
the stock on a barrow ,that Mrs. Biggar
loved mushrooms, he proceeded, after buying
some, to the purchase of rump steak, re-
marking that what you enjoyed did you
good and what you didn’t enjoy was waste.
He was at the top of his form when Ross
came over to us in the hotel. The adven-
tures of the day had taken a new effect;
and the story he told, with roaring laughs, ot
how a good suit had closed the pockets
of his friends and had almost cost him a
potential job, caused Ross to take him to
his heart.
“The job’ll be worth twenty quid a week
to me, I reckon” —it would not have been
Biggar if lie had not put that touch into
it—“and yet there was I, wandering about,
unable to get a bean, until I dropped in on
our old friend here —and he had to borrow
it!”
Ross, having thus been informed of our
mutual impecuniosity, insisted upon being
host; and shortly Biggar was bearing his
share of the shouts, too.. Only Ross’s gen-
erosity could have explained that.
“Look, I must be going,” Biggar exclaimed
at last, “I’ve told you what we’ve been
up against; I’ve got to take dinner home
to the wife and kids.”
“Let’s all go!” cried Ross with the jubila-
tion of a man who is enjoying his generosity.
“We’ll load up and make the evening a
bean-oh! It’s all on me; and I’ve got my
car waiting.”
“Gx-eat! Great!” roared Biggar.
I felt it would be mean of me to put
any obstacle in the way of a feast for the
Biggar family after its privations. So we
made, a joyous pilgrimage from stall to
shop and back to the bar again, and soon the
pockets of Biggar’s new suit were bulging.
Any parcel of Biggar’s that will go into his
pockets he always puts there; and fried
fish, for one-thing, is not good for suits, new
or old, when carried like that.
“You’ll be making a mess of those clothes
of yours,” I warned him.
“What’s a suit or so in a happy world?”
demanded Biggar
We burst upon an astonished Biggar
family like bearers of gifts from the gods:
but it struck me that Mrs. Biggar, although
her welcome to her husband was the same
affectionate and even worshipping thing it
had always been, seemed as though affected
by a feeling of terror that touched the
children also.
“All: our < troubles are over, sweetheart,”
Biggar boomed. “To-night we’ll eat, drink
and be merry, for to-morrow I’ve got a job.”
“Oh, Tom!” exclaimed Mrs. Biggar de-
lightedly. “Even if it’s only four pounds a
week!”
Mrs. Biggar’s pathetid longing for a
regular four pounds a week, whilst Biggar
spoke in thousands, had always touched me.
“Pshaw!” said Tom. “Four pounds? If
I don’t make twenty pounds a week out of
it I’m a Dutchman! I’ve got another
scheme.”
“Four pounds a week regularly would be
splendid,” said Mrs. Biggar doggedly. But
she was diverted to a new ecstasy when
she saw him in the light of the dining-room.
“A new suit! Oh, Tom! Doesn’t he look
splendid?” she said, turning to us. “I’ve
always told him he pays for dressing; and
he’s so foolish to be careless about his
clothes.”
Tom was still laughing when there came
a ring at the door. The scared atmosphere
seemed to drop upon the family again.
“It’s the landlord, I think; he’s been here
several times,” whispered Mrs. Biggar.
A silence fell upon us, and through it the
sharp ring sounded again.
“Dop’t you worry, sweetheart!” cried
Biggar cheerily, and, excusing himself, strode
to the door, from which came the sound of
a conversation in which' the voice of Biggar
rose in his best mood. “Sorry I missed
y0u.... Only just came home in my friend’s
car” (Ross’s car was something to look
at) .... “Twenty pounds a week”....
It was in vain. Hoarse mutters came as
a gloomy chorus to Biggar’s rhapsodies; our
conversation was made more awkward by
the terror that had smitten the family.
“He’s an obstinate old cow,” Biggar said
when he reappeared.
“He can’t do anything,” I said, “if you’ve
taken”
“I haven’t,” returned Biggar briefly.
“Haven’t had time. We’ve only been here
three weeks.”
“How much is it?” Ross asked sympatheti-
cally.,
“Four pounds ten! A paltry four pounds
ten!”
Biggar said it .bitterly, in his best manner.
“If one of you chaps could let me have
a cheque,” he suggested hopefully, “I’d
promise on my oath you’ll get the money
back.”
My heart sank. I knew the sort of work
Biggar is prepared to do with cheques.
Ross, who had been going l through his
pockets with a wry face, went through them
again. The same performance was forced
upon me, and my cheque-book flopped out
of a mass of papers as if eager to betray
itself— and me.
There was certainly no justification for
the glad cry Mrs. Biggar gave; my bank
account is not a thing to give gladness at
any time. But Mrs. Biggar is one who be-
lieves there is magic in cheques. Her joy
made the situation harder for me.
“Four pounds ten is the amount,” said
Biggar helpfully. “Make it out to B. Casper
and strike out ‘bearer’ and cross it.”
“What’s the good of me giving you a
cheque?” I said desperately. “I’ve nothing
in the bank; and when it comes back”
“Doesn’t matter, old chap,” said Biggar.
“If it’s like that all the better. It’ll be up
to me then. I’ll fix it.”
“I don’t want to be asked to close my
account,” I said. “It’s useful to me.”
“Fll see you * have no trouble,” Biggar
vowed. He saw my doubtful look. “You’ve
never known me break my word to a friend
oyer a big thing. Oh, I don’t mean matters
of five hob or so. Think of what it means
to my family.”
I was reflecting that, after all, on two
occasions when Biggar had induced me to
give him cheques to juggle with, by some
magic they had been cleared, whdn Ross put
in : “I’d do it like a shot if I had my cheque-
book.” And Mrs. Biggar said: “Oh, I’m
sure he’s going to do it.”
It seemed to me the spellbound children
were adding to her pleadings. Even if my
credit in the bank was only 2s. lid., I had
to give that bit of paper. It was done
with the inward hope that the landlord would
reject it, saying he would rather wait an-
other day. But he had been observing
Ross’s motor-car. He probably thought it
was mine.
It was a happy party that night, except
that that cheque was a death’s-head at the
feast for me. It gave me nightmare for a
week, during which I was ashamed to face
my bank. I expected daily the curt note
asking me to close my account.
Nothing happened ; yet Biggar’s failure to
see me still created a doubt in my mind.

He was the bedraggled, boisterous Biggar

proclaimed. Thank him, sweetheart! That

might find with them a strong tendency to
avoid any great physical exercise. In fact,
the sufferers feeling an almost unconquerable
desire to simply sit down and take things
“easy,” and it is just possible they may experi-
ence dizziness, occasional headaches, and a
general lack of interest in things which deeply

Mirpil
Skin Balm
Ideal for
SUNBURN
MIRPIL is a soothing and cooling
lotion scientifically prepared to correct
chafed skin, sunburn, windburn, sore and
tired feet. Will keep the skin soft and
smooth. Dries in a few minutes without
leaving any greasy after-effect.
Windburn and Sunburn. —When the
skin is burned by either wind or sun, or
both, one or more liberal applications of
MIRPIL will bring relief. If the skin is
too tender to bear being touched by hand,
lay a clean linen or cotton cloth, saturated
with the Balm, over the affected part,
Mosquitoes and Sandflies.—MlßPlL
smeared on face and hands at night will
keep mosquitoes away. It also soothes
mosquito and sandfly bites.
sf
Rough Hands.—Besides frequently
having them in water, there are certain
other classes of work in the home, factory,
garden and elsewhere which roughen the
hands of both women and men. The
amount of discomfort thus caused it is
unnecessary to describe. Those who are
affected know it only too well. When
such a condition arises a few applications
of MIRPIL will be found to restore the
natural softness.
To Mothers.—Baby has to be bathed
once or more each day, and between times
there is constant washing of clothes, which
tends to chapped hands. There is no
reason why a mother should not take care
of herself, as well as the baby. Remem-
ber that broken skin provides easy access
for germs, and it is of the greatest import-
ance that the hands be kept healthy and
free from any eruptions that might infect
the baby, either through contact or per
medium of its food. Rub MIRPIL on the
hands frequently, and results will be
found to more than compensate for this
precaution.
Chafed Skin.—ln cases of chafed skin
MIRPIL will prove an efficient emollient.
Sore and Tired Feet.—Apply MIRPIL
to the soles of your feet when sore and
tired. The relief is wonderful.
After Shaving. A small quantity of
MIRPIL rubbed on the face after shaving
will be found soothing.
Before Applying Powder, always rub
MIRPIL into the skin until dry. The
cleansing and cooling actions of this pre-
paration will enhance the comfort which
powder provides,
