Alice, and I, and Memory.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We supped together in modest state—
Alice, and I, and Memory.
We supped together : the hour was late t
“He will not mind—for once ! ” she said.
And I smiled, and she, and nodded her head.
And the silver shafts in her brown hair gleamed,
And my face was sad with the grief of Time;
Yet, “Do you remember . . . that night . . •
we dreamed ? ”
Her eyes flashed Memory over the years,
And I looked, and saw ... “0 Alice, not
tears ! ’’
So I filled her glaBS, and bade her quaff—
But she, merrily : “No, till your lips touch !”
And I touched, and she, with her old-time laugh.
And Memory sat on the glasses’ brink
And oh! so tenderly watched us drink.
And I was a youth, and she was a maid :
Our eyes were bright, and we locked warm
hands,
And gazed at the future unafraid . . .
And midnight was chiming! . . . Ah Alice, ah
me!
How old, how sad, was Memory !
A Book of the Girlish Imagination.
Lilian Turner joins sister Ethel in the great
company of bookmakers. Her first-published
long story, “The Lights of Sydney, or, No Past
is Dead,” gained first prize in a competition
organised by an English firm of publishers, and
was issued last year as a magazine Christmas num-
ber. It now attacks the public more formally in
a volume (posted from Bulletin office, 3s. and 45.).
The book is an excellent beginning. Miss
Turner’s literary style is fluent, and her matter
has fair emotional interest. She should become a
very popular writer. And it is popularity that
pays.
“The Lights of Syduey ” takes credit for one
thing : it is not merely a collection of chapter
episodes tagged on to the characters after “ Pick
wick Papers ” fashion : there is a definite attemp i
at plot and continuity and climax. But the plot
has the ludicrous twang of the Young Ladies
Journal. Miss Turner is all right when she gets
her characters on to the working plane, but all
beginning and ending the strain of lifting-up anc
taking-down is tremendous.
The main hinge is Auntie’s legacy. If Ida’s boy
marries Cousin Frew’s eldest girl, he gets £30,000;
and another £30,000 is divided between Ida and
Cousin Frew. If either party refuses to marry, the
.£60,000 goes to the other party. Auntie didn’t
provide for the contingency of both refusing to
marry, and whacking the £60,000. Auntie never
does : she puts her trust in the Machine-God, and
He inevitably pulls her through.
Enter Ida’s Wioked Husband. He is labelled
“Very Bad Man,” and he trims his nails with a
pen-knife before his wife, and has “many other
unpleasant habits.” What he has done beyond
trimming his nails with a pen-knife isn’t clear;
for Ida won’t tell. It isn’t infidelity, or cruelty,
or desertion ; but he is a Very Bad Man. So Ida
deserts him, as is the prescriptive right of woman,
and takes her two-year-old son along with her.
This son is called Jem.
The Wicked Husband is in Melbourne: Ida
flees to Sydney. And what does the Wicked
Husband do? Does he pursue her, and bring back
the precious key to the £60,000 ? Not at all. He
knows there is no difficulty nowadays in-personat-
ing the real Sir Roger. So he buys from his
sister her two-year-old boy, his nephew, for
“thousands,” brings him home to the suburban
nursery, and calls him James. Of course, two-
year-old babies are as much alike as pins, or peas,
or drops of water ; and nobody suspects nothing.
It will be the easiest thing in the world to prove
the bona-fide James an impostor—and his mother.
“ Ha ! ha ! ” chuckles the Very Bad Man.
This news is at onoe brought Ida by a trusted
friend—-a Very Good Man, who doesn’t compre-
hend the true inwardness of it. And what does
Ida do ? Does she indignantly denounce the vil-
lainy which aims to defraud her son of his rights,
and make him a—what? Not at all; she ac-
quiesces calmly; tells the trusted friend nothing
of the truth. The Machine-God will have it so.
And the Machine-God repays her. How ?
Why, by good luck Cousin Frew up-the-country
wants a governess, and sure enough the M.G. gets
Ida the billet. “ Widows ” with a boy two years
old are always popular as governesses, and stay a
long time in their situations. Ida stays about 17
years; and all that time her identity is unsus-
pected, and James grows up with Cousin Frew’s
eldest girl, Catherine, just as Auntie would like
it, and is treated as one of the family, as gove
nesses’children are always treated, and Mrs. Fre
is a sister to the governess. And the Very Bac
Man comes on a visit with James, and meets h:
son Jem, and hears about Ida, and goes avva-
happy and ignorant. The Machine-God has
sweat a bit just here.
But now Miss Turner is into deep water, anc
can swim. She has all the concessions she want
can fall to describing Barbara. Barbara
Catherine’s younger sister, and makes up th
quartette.. And Barbara is good : almost the on
character in the book who is more than a clothe
horse for incidents and sentiments. She is
anchor of hope in the trouble that Miss Turne
may become a mere writer of women’s books fo
women.
But there must be no tangle about Jem anc
James. (Miss Turner tangles them herself, anc
there is a lightning change of characters ’twix
Jem and James towards the close.) The situatio
at this stage is—
Jem, the manly real Sir Roger, loves madcap Barbara.
James, the quiet Claimant, also loves madcap Barbara.
Barbara is going to love James (alter the transformation
Catherine, the quiet heiress, loves Jem.
There is obviously room for a little complicate
love-play here, with the parents pulling strings fo
Auntie, and Miss Turner manages her oppor
tunities capably. And from a side-entrance com
a sister of Claimant James, and her dead baby
which Barbara picks up at Katoomba, givin
opportunity for Harradenish reflections of whic
some are fair and some tolerable and some in
tolerable. And by this time the pages are movin
past 200, and the Day of. the Machine*Lord is a
hand.
Suddenly Jem, the real Sir Roger, loses his bole
enchanting attributes, and becomes a fit mate fo
the meek Catherine, that the will of Auntie ma;
be fulfilled. And James, the quiet Claimant
puts on the cloak of manliness which drops frou
the retiring Jem, and bustles Barbara into marry
ing him. They even change names—Jem become
J ames, and James J em. It is a fearful thing for
a hero to fall into the hands of the Machine-God.
Then all the characters are called before the
curtain. The Very Good Man threatens the
Very Bad Man with gaol, and the V.B.M. Bays il
he goes the conniving Ida will have to go too
This aspect of affairs so overwhelms the company
that the V.B.M. walks off with a substantia
share of Auntie’s plunder, and is Wicked ever
afterwards, no doubt. The Machine-God oughi
really to have run a tram-car over the Very Bac
Man.
Sufficient has been said to show how Miss Tur-
ner stands from the point of view of Literature.
In construction, her book is orude and clumsy
but, given the characters and incidents, she
handles her matter well, sometimes very well. It
is all foreshadowed in an illustration on page 9.
You see Ida deserting her husband, with her two-
year-old on one arm and her bag on the other. It
is a pretty picture, and if you will look at it merely
as a pretty picture, and not hamper it with ques-
tions of probability and reality, it has some in-
terest and possibly charm. But it is not in the
least like a woman deserting her husband in real
life. Ida in the picture is coming down the
steps quite peacefully with her gloves on,
accurately buttoned, and just the right amount of
cuff and shoe showing. Her bag is a very small
bag, into which she might get one frock and a
comb ; but there is certainly no room for baby’s
clothes. And baby sits quite nicely and smiles :
he does not wriggle and twist, and his weight
does not give Ida the least inconvenience, though
she is holding him all on one side to make a nice
picture. And Ida has no parasol, and no cloak,
and her dress sits beautifully, and although she
lived at least 25 years ago it is cut in almost the
latest fashion, with the familiar puffed sleeves.
And there are no fluster or excitement, or
injunctions to the two-year-old to sit still,
or wild grabs at the railings, or untied laces,
or agitated recollections whether she has put
everything in. It is all “ pretty,” and “artistic,”
and three-fourths of it absolutely untrue. So
with “ The Lights of Sydney.”
But the public—the great public of the Young
Ladies’ Journal —doesn’t want truth in litera-
ture.
Rev. Fitchett’s rechauffe of British nava
and military history in “Deeds that Won the
Empire ” is well enough made, but any capable
journalist could have made it as well. Eitchett’s
merit comes in his fine eye for a popular topic,
with great (journalistic) results attainable by little
labor.
Geo. Robertson and Co. issue a new
edition of G. H. Gibson’s “Ironbark Chips and

include some of Percy Spence’s best work in

first appeared in The Bulletin, and his book has
previously been noted as readable. His ballad-
models seem to have been taken from Tom Hood
and Gilbert, and he dates unmistalzeably in show-
ing not a trace of Kipling’s influence. Posted

little poetical thought. So Keats may rest easy,

Thus their two hearts were as one trembling lyre
With passion of wild music all afire,
It was with them as when some island tide

Warm outlined on his own, and all the sped
Of beauty maddening in his passionate blood
Till on her warm wild lips his glowing flood
Is broken in one breathless, deathless kiss,
And all her being surrenders unto his,
And earth and sea together fus4d lie,
Glowing in one, beneath one glowing sky.
The air hereabouts seems warmer than it
usually is in the groves of Academe; and
voluptuous summer-bosom’s swell ” may be
turned three times on the palate—resolutely sup-
pressing suggestions of (1) Byron’s “ voluptuous
swell, (2) summer-boarders, (3) a dude strutting
with a clean dickey. At his worst M.-L. is mixed
or stiff, or troubled with awkward or 111-soundint
decasyllabics like—
Or through grey miser's hour-glass time's sparse grains.
And past a myriad half-uttered sounds of things.
Fulfilling there almighty love's almighty heats.
Leaning upon his breast her glorious head,
And he comforting her was comforted.
For the rest, there are “large curled lips,” anc
“soft amorous cheeks,” and “swift impetuous
tresses ” —the whole box of fleshly phrases, in
fact, or as many of them as Mrs. G. will stand
(is there any Mrs. M.-H.?), And careful perusal
is sufficiently rewarded by—
Thus in the fair night shone the fairer moon,
And in the moon the mere, and in the mere

Upon a foaming cataract of hair.
And—
Fine sounds, like harp-tones through high chanoels rolled,
Piercing the heart with rapturous despair:
And—
He felt all flush on his her melting faoe,
Upon his ardent eyes her hungry gaze.
And through her glowing vest, the short sharp shocks of
bliss
That maddened in her bosom, maddening his,
And those empurpled winy grapes her mouth,
Crushed in his lips' insatiable drouth;
And all their limbs all faint with fond desire,
And filled with life’s infatuate fever-smart,
That loosens the deep fountains of the heart,
Infesting every vein with streams of fire.
Notes.
“ Infesting ” seems queer; but is correct: the
true English meaning borrows the Latin metonymy
—“troubling,” “plaguing.” Curious how the
su ggestion of number has crept into contemporary
meaning - through association with bands of
thieves “infesting” a district? For nowadays
the suggestion of plaguing is dominated by that
of pervading : “My place is infested with rats”
doesn’t necessarily contain any hint of worry.
And in Longfellow’s verse—
And the night shall be filled with musio,
And the cares that infest the day
Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,
And as silently steal away—
“infest,” for most people, means simply “fill.”
There is still a bad taste in the word, but it seems
going. Already, perhaps, you might venture
“The poem is infested with beauties” without
causing the general reader much discomfort.—No,
Dr. Murray’s big dictionary isn’t up to “I” yet.
“Short sharp shock.”— That slight mental hesi-
tancy comes from W. S. Gilbert—
To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock,
In a pestilential prison with a life-long lock,
Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shook,
From a cheap and chippy ohopper on a big, black block 1
What a nuisance memory is !
“Mouth” and “drouth”—of course. They
were made for each other. When Le Gallienne
kisses “just thar,” he remarks—
O love 1 love 1 I fear,
For the air is too sweet—
Softly., love—O my dear—
Yea, too sweet
On a sudden to meet
Mortal mouth !
O my sweet I O my sweet!
The long drouth!
And at last, dear,
O think—
The long drink l
But “mouth” is a lovely word in any case—the
melting m and the soft breath of the final th are
things to dote over. You do not get the fragrance
in Byron’s—
That, womankind had but one rosy mouth,
To kiss Ultra all at once from north to south ;
But it comes in Kendall’s “ September ”
Sweet month, with a mouth that is made of a rose.
English melody, indeed, owes much to the soft th
“ Out of the sweet south sliding,” “The vasty
halls of death,” and so on.
Reflections.
But it was already decided that learning kills
the imagination.
Well, well, suppose humanity had stayed
asexual, like the earthworms, or hermaphrodite,
like oysters at Is. a plate ?
Chas. Lyne’s Life of Parkes is to be pub-
lished in a few weeks at sixteen shillings. Sixteen
shillings is stiff : is Parkes worth sixteen shillings ?
Certes, the volume comes with a testimonial from
its subject— “full,” “accurate,” “ honest,”
“painstaking,” the old man calls it. Yet are
these exactly the epithets one would wish applied
to a magnum opus ? (And Parkes measured
his epithets—he did.) The Life of Parkes
shouldn’t be too monumental, and respectable,
and solid, and dull. It should gambol a little (he
did). And it might misplace an aspirate occa-
sionally (he did) —but Mr. Lyne has seen to this
already : vide Chap. XLY.—“ An Heroic Strug-
gle.”
And if Mr. Lyne wants some irregular
lines to light np a blank page, here are those
which G. K. Maclean has sent to The Bulletin.
They are far too enthusiastically phrased for The
Bulletin, and the key of the whole, the Baconian
cipher-word “IminOrtal,” has the last of the
three vowels incorrect. But the biographer will
not mind that.

notable name. It may be alphabetical, but it
is not judicious.) The book reviews chess history
in all Australasian provinces, records the games of
the Esling-Wallace championship match, gives an

F. : “ Soap and water for Sydney Lending
Library habitues.” They supply ’em in Melb.
Library, and there have been several prosecutions
for stealing the soap. But isn’t the soap dodge a
mere mousetrap for a rabbit plague ? The unclean
derelicts who haunt public libraries are, many of
them, walking menageries of bacteria, visible and
invisible. In Melb. Library one occasionally
opens a book to find obscene man-parasites be-
tween the pages. Insectiferous loafers should be
treated as the semi-criminals, semi-invalids
that they are. Attorney - General Isaacs
some time since took off his coat in th&
Melb. Library the more conveniently to ransack
law-books. He was officially forced to resume
his coat, and a press correspondence ensued. The
undisclosed reason behind the official act was that
if Isaacs were allowed to take off his coat in the
law gallery, the dirty fellows in the fiction bay
downstairs would want to take off their ooats,
with results too gross to specify. Some of the
favorite Melb. volumes could be fried in their
own fat. One theory for missing books is that
they walk away, like proverbial cheese. Can’t
insectiferous loafers be kept out of our libraries ? ”
HENRY PARKES.
In the dim past, great men have lived and died
They had their gaudy day ; but Time, alas !
Hath blotted out their glory and their pride:
Their deeds and virtues were as brittle glass I
Nay, more, their very names are set aside.
But this Immortal whom we now lament
Hath writ his large renown, with pen of fire,
Around the Half-Globe where he pitch’d his tent.
Though rear’d a hireling, he did high aspire ;
And men made way as for a demi-god.
He was their Idol: they were but his tools ;
Nor did he hesitate to break each rod,
For, in his mind, all men were knaves or fools:
A wily, suasive, caustic, studious soul;
Whose strong imperious nature clutch’d control.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis (Jure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE. —Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first, dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I be atne,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

Dr. GIBBOKTS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely : —Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CORED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a

“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodvne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

WARNERS
Reliable
The Old
Disease is an effect, not a cause. Its origin
is within; its manifestations without. Hence,
to cure the disease the cause must be removed,
and in no other way can a cure ever be ef-
fected. Warner’s Safe Cure is established on
just this principle. It realises that
95 PER CENT.
of all diseases arise from deranged Kidneys
and Liver, and it strikes at once at the root
of the difficulty. The elements of which it is
composed act directly upon these great organs,
both as a food and restorer, and, by placing
them in a healthy condition, drive disease and
pain from the system.
For the innumerable troubles caused by
unhealthy Kidneys, Liver and Urinary Organs:
for the distressing Disorders of Women: for
all Nervous Affections, and physical derange-
ments generally, this great remedy has no
equal. Its past record is a guarantee 01
continued performance.

The Shadow of the Bars.
[The following verses are from the pen of Thomas Suf-
field, now under sentence of 10 years penal servitude in
N.S.W. for an alleged criminal assault of which, in this
paper’s opinion, he was never proved guilty. Wensley-
dale, it appears, is Suffield’s English birthplace.]
(The shadow of the bars upon
The cell-wall in the moonlight :
The shadows of the trees upon
The moonlit laxvn at home.)
Oh ! Wensleydale ! dear Wensleydale !
What tho : I be so far away,
And lonely pace a prison cell \
To hold a deadly wrong at bay ;
The moon she crosses, white and pure,
My narrow prison’s barred pale':
And she shall be a silver lure
To lead me back—to Wensleydale.
Pall! bolt and bar ! Ring ! steel and stone !
At fall of night, and break of day,
This body is your lien alone ;
This heart unfettered flies away,
By glow and glt-am, thro’ cloud and rain,
O’er wild and waste, o’er hill and vale,
O’er steep and strand, o’er sea and main,
My heart is back in Wensleydale.
Oh ! Wensleydale ! dear Wensleydale !
Not bolt nor bar can part us two ;
Though cherished hopes lie deathly pale,
I still have left the past with you !
Once more, upon the wooded lawn,
I watch the flickering shadows fail;
Once more, upon the river borne,
I hear the bells of Wensleydale !
Once more, and thro’ this wicket gate
The well-known path be mine to-night,
Where the great beeches meet and mate,
Grim sentinels in black and white.
Here —resting on this uncouth seat—
I once was told the fondest tale !
Do Earth and Heaven ever meet ?
I thought so once—in Wensleydale.
’Tis Summer, and the thirsty mere
Hath deeply drained old Tore, I know,
For, falling over Mickley Weir,
His song is breaking faint and low.
Hack Fall’s far thunder trembles down;
Bass-droning thro’ the listening vale,
The rock-stemmed river’s monotone,
The deep keynote of Wensleydale.
Hark ! perched on Mowbray’s ivied height,
A throstle, startled at the moon,
Wakes, half in fear, and half delight,
And lifteth such a wondrous tune !
His mate, deep ambush’d in the dene,
Takes up and fills the liquid tale ;
And sprites of silver, gray, and green
Chant echo all thro’ Wensleydale.
H nr sh o’er the softer sounds of night
O d 'Ebor bays (the great blood-hound);
lucre starting, moonlit, dimly white,
The old home guards its hallowed ground !
With twinkling lights the casements glow ;
Familiar voices faint and fail,
And music soft and laughter low
Thrill “ Home, sweet home ! ” in Wenslet"Hl< 1
Pure lilt of love ! soft stray of bell !
Ah ! plaint of weir, and broken fall !
Sweet sounds, sweet prayers, and —sweetest
spell—
The hallowed homeliness of all.
Surely the night-wind, soft and shy,
Confessing all the sinless vale.
Must breathe a shrift in every sigh
“ Hush, Wensleydale!” “Hush Wensleydale! : ’
THOMAS SUFFIELD.
The N.S.W. Baptist Union has once more
emphasised its dislike of strong drink, and for-
warded a resolution to that effect to both Houses
of Parliament. 80011 after a type-written stanza
from an old writer was freely circulated among
the brethren :
A Bendigo (Vic.) lady seems to have go< d
cause to complain of the weakness of the alleged
strong arm of the law. Some little time ago a
man named Huggins called on her and walloped
her severely, and the law rose up after the event
and gave him seven days. He served his term,
and the very day he came out he called on the
lady and walloped her a great deal harder than
the first time. The law wasn’t around to interfere,
but when the episode was all over it arrived and
gave Huggins four months. His victim is now
trying to get her health up so as to stand another
attack from Huggins when he comes out. Judging
from his persistence, and the way the law never
arrives in time, she reckons that he is going to
spend the rest of his life in gaol for assault, and
whenever he comes out he is going to whack her
again, and then go back to gaol. In fact, she
looks forward to being intermittently whacked by
Huggins for the remainder of her days.
A miracle of love divine
Changed all the water into wine :
Save us from miracles of men
Who want to change it back again

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1896.
The Scramble for the Capital.
One day last week G. Reid, the “jolly and
fat” Premier of N.S. Wales, gave another
shove, in his own characteristic fashion, to
the cause of Federation. At that moment
Australia was still waiting with what patience
it might, for N.S. Wales, the chronic stum-
bling-block, to move out of the road. The
holding of the Federal Convention was in its
usual state of indefinite postponement pend-
ing the time when the Reid Government
would condescend to say when it would be
sufficiently rested to think further over the
matter. As the Federal Constitution hasn’t
yet been drafted, and the Convention which
is to draft it hasn’t met, and the delegates
who are to form the Convention haven’t even
been elected, and no one knows when they
will be elected because Premier Reid refuses
so far to say anything definite about the
matter, and as no one can tell when he will
say anything definite, the future prospects
of the movement are about as shadowy as
they could possibly be. Nevertheless, Pre-
mier Reid last week urged the Assembly to
consent to the erection in Sydney of a palatial
and enormously-expensive House of Parlia-
ment, explaining in an off-hand manner that
it was proposed to make it especially large
and gorgeous in order that it might hold the
Legislature of the future Commonwealth.
Si dney, he added, would be the capital of
Federated Australia, therefore, of course,
the necessity of the new structure was quite
apparent. Then the matter was referred to
the Public Works Committee, which is now
considering the advisability of building in
advance a £470,000 house for the unborn
Legislature of the Federation which has not
yet arrived, and which, if it does arrive,
will choose its own capital and its own
dwelling-place.
* * * *
This infantile folly of the portly jester
whom New South Wales has made the head
of’ its Government is only one item in the
long list of that province’s sins against the
cause of Australian Unity. From almost
any other person than George Reid, the
insolent assumption that Sydney must neces-
sarily be the centre and capital pf the
Commonwealth would have gone a long way
towards breaking up the Federal movement
altogether, and, though Premier Reid
is now the specially - licensed buffoon
of Australian politics, even his attitude
counts for something in the matter. Mr.
Reid has gone out of his v r ay to emphasise,
for the dozenth time or thereabouts, that
New South Wales is in the Federal move-
ment only for what she can get. That pro-
vince has been all along the principal obstacle
to union, and, at the same time, the one
which demanded most emphatically that, of
whatever immediate cash-profit there might
be in the movement, she must have the
largest share. When a first humble be-
ginning was made by the establishment of
the Federal Council at Hobart, the mother-
province was the only one of the six Aus-
tralias which consistently refused to take any
part in the proceedings. A great deal of the
weakness and purposelessness of that Council
was probably owing to this defection; if it had
represented all Australia it might possibly have
grown to be something better than it was, but
as matters stood it merely petrified. When the
famous Convention of ’9l took place New
South Wales condescended to be represented.
One of its representatives— Parkes, the then
Premier—started the spirit of brotherhood
by reciting a mass of garbled statistics re the
greatness of New South Wales and the small-
ness and poverty of her principal rival,
Victoria ; and another—his successor, Dibbs
—truculently demanded that the very first
business should be to recognise Sydney as
the capital of the proposed Union. Even in
those early days the N.S. Wales representa-
tives stated in effect that their province was
in the movement only for plunder, and that
the honor and profit of possessing the seat of
Government was the price of its adhesion.
* * * *
Since then its attitude has been varied and
uncertain. It was N.S. Wales which blocked
the movement for three years by refusing
even to introduce the Convention Bill as
promised in the ’9l Convention. There are
three cities which demand loudly and per-
sistently to be nominated as the Federal
capital, and all three (Sydney, Bathurst, and
Albury) are in N.S. Wales. The present
Bathurst Convention, though its principal
unavowed purpose is to secure the nomina-
tion of a certain obscure trader to the Legis-
lative Council, is also called largely for the
purpose of advertising the demands of the
City of the Plains to be the future seat of
government. One dreadful politician even
advanced it as one of the special advantages
of Bathurst by comparison with Albury that
a Federal Legislature sitting there would not
be so liable to fall under “Victorian in-
fluences.” And this statement pretty well
represents the attitude of the cornstalk pro-
vince in the matter. The politician in question
blandly assumed that the capital should be in
N.S. Wales, asa hiatterof course; that Victoria
shouldn’t be allowed any influence whatever
in the Legislature—the idea of Queensland,
S.A., Westralia or Tasmania even expecting
to have any influence was presumably so im-
possible that they were not worth mention-
ing ; that Federation is to consist in New
South Wales governing the rest of Australia
as a species of conquered dependency ; that
the Federal Legislature will naturally have
no voice in fixing the seat of government ;
and that Sydney will naturally run the whole
show. And Premier Reid, who announces
that Sydney will be the Federal centre—he
being apparently the Federal movement in
his own person and having selected the
metropolis on his own responsibility—and
proposes to build a palace to accommodate
the future Australian Legislature, goes even
one better than the Bathurst convention or
the local fathers of little, obscure, sleepy
Albury.
• * * *
If there is ever going to be anything in
the alleged great Federal cause, there will have
to be a very serious climb-down on the part
of the so-called mother province. Except
for a little obscure wail from Tasmania,
which apologetically submitted its dreary
town of Hobart as a possible metropolis, all
the other provinces have advanced no special
claims of their own. None of them has
demanded possession of the centre of
Government as a matter of right, or urged
that the Legislature of the Common-
wealth should be kept clear of the
“influences” of the other provinces, or
insisted—as some members of the dominant
political party in Sydney have done—that
the other provinces shall accept their special
fiscal gospel as an indispensable condition of
union. And if Federation is going to be a
permanent success the bumptious cornstalk
person must consent to be an ordinary mem-
ber of the political family, and take his
chance with the rest. The selection of the
metropolis or of the place to create a metro-
polis must be made by the representatives of
all Australia, and if they do their duty they
will set aside all mere provincial ambi-
tions and consider solely the interests of the
continent at large. The future capital should
be as central as possible, safe from foreign
invasion, and selected with a view to the
future when population will be diffused
throughout all the habitable parts of Aus-
tralia—not to the casual and accidental pre-
sent, when, owing to purely transient circum-
stances, it is mainly fringed along the
eastern coast. If the choice lies among two
or three sites, the one chosen should, other
things being equal, be that where population
is thinnest; the establishment of the Federal
capital will create population, and the object
should be to draw it where the country most
wants development. In any case, Sydney
and Melbourne should both be left abso-
lutely out of consideration; they already
contain much too large a proportion of this
country’s population for the country's good,
and Australia is practically a big continent
which lives to maintain two bloated cities,
therefore, it is bad policy to artificially bloat
either of them any further. Also, Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, Perth, and
Brisbane should all be struck off the list of
possible candidates as being exposed and not
easily defensible. But whatever site is
selected, the bumptious N.S.W. politician
has no claim to any special consideration,
and the sooner he realises it the better.
* * • *
Federation means striking an average
among six possibilities. If the future Aus-
tralian Legislature does its duty conscien-
tiously, without fear or favor, the dominant
party in New South Wales may, or may not,
find a rigid protective tariff fixed upon it,
just as the majority of votes chances to go.
It may secure the centre of Government, or,
on the other hand, that coveted distinction
may go to South Australia, or Queensland,
or even Victoria, and Sydney be left a mere
provincial city, and Albury and Bathurst be
passed by without a semblance of considera-
tion. New South Wales may supply the
largest half of the Federal Ministry, or, again,
its politicians may prove very small and
ordinary individuals when they appear in a
larger arena, and the first Federal Cabinet
may not contain a single N.S.W. representa-
tive, and the province which claimed the
metropolis as a matter of right may find it-
self practically bossed by some dreadful Tas-
manian person running a legislature at some
place like Thargomindah or Hergott. Also,
Federation may bring a vast stream of com-
merce to Port Jackson, or, on the other
hand, the abolition of border tariffs, and the
expansion of the railway system under
Federal management, and the abolition of
differential rates may take away commerce
especially from the remote parts of the
province, into new channels. That Federa-
tion will do much good to Australia at
large is certain ; but if New South Wales
is only going into it on the understanding
that it gets all the principal advantages, and
has a special, immediate boom all to itself,
then it hasn’t begun to understand the
meaning of the term.
* * * *
The principal reason put forward by Syd-
ney politicians why their province should
have a certain undefined supremacy and be
duly or unduly grovelled to in this matter is
that N.S. Wales is the oldest member of the
Australian group. But against this there is
the fact that it is no older geographically
than any other, and that its people
are no older than other Australians,
and that their fathers weren’t any older
than the fathers of other Australians,
and that if their city is older than
other Australian cities it wasn’t the present
generation which made it older, therefore the
present generation can claim no special con-
sideration on that account. Moreover, there
is no visible reason why the capital should be
in the oldest province any more than in the
youngest one, or the middle one, or the one
half-way between the middle and some other
place. It is also claimed that New South
Wales has the most extensive population—
and these are about all the reasons advanced
for its large, aggressive attitude. Against
th 5 m may be set the equally relevant fact
that Westralia is the largest province, and
that Tasmania is the smallest, and that Vic-
toria is the most thickly peopled and best
cultivated, and has the largest city and the
most historical bank smash ; and that
Queensland has for many years shown the
largest percentage of population increase,
and the biggest debt per head ; and that
South Australia has the fewest criminals and
illegitimate births and the longest unpayable
railway—all of which are equally valid proofs
that any or every one of them should claim the
capital also. Any one set of proofs is about
as sound and about as ridiculous as the other.
The moral of it all is a very old one, but one
that can hardly be too often repeated. The
object of Federation is to boom all Aus-
tralia ; not to help any one province or any
one set of small provincial politicians at the
expense of the rest. And the policy of New
South Wales in scrambling for the capital of
the Commonwealth before there is any
Commonwealth, and proposing to build a
home for the Legislature which doesn’t yet
exist, and arrogating to herself a position of
leadership to which she hasn’t been appointed
and which she has done nothing to earn, is
the best way to break up the Federal move-
ment altogether.
The Q.N. Bank “Revelations.”
The Queensland National Bank is now an-
nounced to be utterly insolvent, and the usual
wail for State assistance goes up to heaven and
to Premier Hugh Nelson —the representative on
earth of the only heaven which theQ.N.B. just
now cares for. That the Queensland National
would cast itself on the State when private
management brought it down to the last pos-
sible stage of insolvency and muddle and mis-
representation, went without saying. The
theory of Australian banking in good times is
that the State can’t run a bank; that for it to
even propose to do so is ridiculous—this with a
smile of lofty contempt from the private bank-
ing “ expert ; ” that State banking would lead
to corruption and immorality ; that it is itself
immoral; also, that it is impossible, ruinous,
and a mere dream of the ignorant, brutal Labor
party or of the anarchist who elocutes by
Yarra’s muddy shore. And in bad times, when
the bank is cronk, and the cooked balance-sheet
can’t pass muster any longer, the same lofty
expert declares it to be the special business of
the State to take over the responsibility, and
put things straight, and run the bank till they
are put straight, and then hand it back in good
order and condition. And when the State has
finished doing this the private “expert” will
doubtless say as confidently as ever that the
State can’t do banking business, and that pri-
vate management is the only successful kind in
existence. It is a noble sight when the recon-
structed bankers get together, and the manager
of the bank which has intimated that it can’t
meet its engagements, takes the chair and they
pass a resolution regretting the absence of the
manager whose bank is paying ss. in the £, and
then the managers of the banks which were
lately saved by a State guarantee all agree that
State interference in banking is a thing too
awful to be considered for a moment in any
well-regulated community.
• • • •
The history of State interference in Aus-
tralian banking business of late years can be
put in a few words. It includes the propping
up of the Queensland National Bank some years
ago by a loan of sundry millions of public
money ; the rescue of the Bank of New Zealand
from utter destruction by the State assuming
the management and putting in 2| millions to
fill the gap which private management had left;
the rescue of its offshoot, the B.N.Z. Estates
Co., by State cash and State control; and the res-
cue of the Colonial Bank of Maoriland, which is
now confessed to have been drifting into a lament-
able position till the community took it over
also, and enabled it to cast its burden on the
Lord —the only Lord that the private banker
knows in times of adversity, i.e. , the State. It
was the State guarantee which came in to stop
the ’93 run on the Sydney Savings Bank. In
the same year the State indirectly, by means of
the Dibbs Government’s Bank-Notes Act, guar-
anteed the City Bank of Sydney, Bank of New
South Wales, and several others, and whether
the assistance was essential or not, it was un-
doubtedly of great value. The State also in-
formally guarantees the Bank of Adelaide;
every other S.A. bank has gone to wreck under
private management, and when the storm of ’93
raged around the one survivor, it was intimated
that the Government would come to its rescue,
if necessary. It proved not at all necessary,
but the informal guarantee still exists, and pos-
sibly it w'as only the fact that it was ready
which kept it from being wanted. And now
the disreputable, insolvent Q.N. Bank follows
the general example, and falls on the capacious
bosom of the State—as usual.
* * * *
The Bulletin has long expressed the opinion
that the Q.N. Bank was in a bad way, and it
proves, on State examination, to be in even a
worse way than was suspected. The paid-up
capital (,£899,552) is all gone ; so is the alleged
profit and loss balance (£46,995), and the other
alleged reserves—in fact, the whole of the
shareholders’ money, amounting on paper to
£1,182,613. In addition £1,252,810 of the
depositors’ money has vanished, so the shortage
is £2,435,423, and the balance-sheet, which
showed a constant surplus of assets over
liabilities, is to that extent a lie and a delusion.
That is to say, it would be a lie and a delusion
if it had stated that the assets were real and
tangible, but as it merely alleged that the paid-
up capital and the deposits were so much,
which they were, and the advances were so
much, which they were, and didn’t even profess
to assert that the advances were good, or that
the capital wasn’t lost, or that the deposits
were intact, it was, perhaps, about as truthful
as could be expected. Also, the auditors per-
sistently stated that the balance-sheet was cor-
rect “ according to the books,” which seems to
have been quite true. It was just as correct as
the books and no more so.
★ * IP *
Then the report goes on to intimate that even
this awful shortage isn’t the whole of the
trouble by a long way. Many dead accounts
on which no interest is recoverable, and where
the principal is consequently a matter to be
viewed with serious suspicion, have been taken
at their full book value. The assets have been
estimated, not at their present worth, but at
what they may fetch if the bank keeps alive
and they are judiciously realised when
better times come, supposing they do come.
Bank premises, too, are taken at original
cost. It is explained that the alleged profits
shown since the ’93 reconstruction were
largely bogus, made by reckoning in interest
which couldn’t be collected on accounts that
were more or less defunct. The dividends paid
since ’93 were not earned, and whether those
previously paid were all earned or not the com-
mittee declines to say. The provision made for
losses has apparently been inadequate from the
beginning or nearly so, and the Q.N.B. seems
to have been either a wilful fraud or a
sanguine delusion nearly all its life. So far as
can be gathered by reading between the lines
of the report, the institution, if put into sudden
and compulsory liquidation, would stand on
much the same level as the Mercantile, Federal
or City of Melbourne did under the same cir-
cumstances. Nothing is said about the persons
responsible for this ghastly condition of things,
but presumably it was all done by manager
Drury, the Man that’s Dead. The case of the
lamented Colin Longmuir has already shown
the inestimable advantage of having a dead
manager on the premises.
* * * *
All the Queensland National Bank asks under
these painful circumstances is that the old
management which issued the lying balance-
sheets, and lost the money, and paid the divi-
dends which weren’t earned out of the profits
which were bogus, should go on much as usual;
that the shareholders who have no money left
in the concern should still own it; that divi-
dends should still be paid—presumably out of
the deficiency ; and that the old reconstructed
deposits apparently the whole £7,000,000
or more—should be fixed permanently, and
never fall due for repayment at all unless
in case of liquidation, and that the State
should guarantee the payment of principal
and interest for ever and ever, and get
nothing in return. Even the most aggressive
of Eat-Man Governments couldn’t face these
monstrous proposals. But the Government is
prepared to go a long way. It guarantees the
new depositors—about £BOO,OOO worth—for 12
months, so as to prevent a run and give the in-
stitution time to turn round, if such a dry-
rotted concern can turn round without falling


into dust. It proposes that the shareholders
should simply be invited to give up their inter-
est —which, as they have no interest left, is a
small thing to ask —and that, in return for this,
they should be forgiven the £360,000 of unpaid
capital which ought to go towards making good
the shortage. Then the private reconswindled
depositors are to take over the institution and
become the shareholders, and it seems to be
understood that the State is to help them
through by waiting further for its money
and reducing interest to 2\ per cent. As the
Government balance, or at least £2,000,000 of
it, represents money borrowed at about 4 per
cent, to keep the Q.N.B. on its legs, this conces-
sion would mean a State subsidy of over £30,000
a year. Therefore, the State is to lose £30,000
a year, and the shareholders lose £899,000, and
the depositors lose about £1,250,000, and the
loss is beautifully distributed all round.
* * * *
The moral of the Q.N. Bank disaster is the
same old moral. Its leading features are that
balance-sheets are largely waste-paper; that
auditors’ certificates are of no value whatever,
because the certificate tells the same old story
whether things are good or bad ; that private
audits are a mockery ; and that directors and
managers tell the whole exact truth when it
suits them. The Q.N., like every other bank
which has gone wrong, showed a prosperous
and duly-audited balance-sheet right up to the
day when its awful deficiency came to light;
therefore, tlie bank shareholder who relies on
the big, prosperous report of any large concern
with a million paid-up capital and a million
reserves, and a 10 or 15 per cent, dividend and
a liberal balance to carry forward, would do
well to remember that almost every bank shows
things like these till the bottom falls out, and
that his concern, too, may have been insolvent for
ten years past for all the evidence to the con-
trary. And until there is a regular system of
State audit these things will continue to be so.
The Q.N.B.’s request for a State report on its
condition was a tacit acknowledgment that
private audits and balance-sheets are such
well-known lies that they are wholly useless in
an emergency. Further, it was a tacit acknow-
ledgment that State audit is a lot more reliable
than the private article. The banker’s precept
in good times and his practice in bad ones are
woefully dissimilar.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Artificial Boom.
If the thing can be managed it is evident that
Sydney is going to have a giddy, garish boom
about the year 1900. The Reid Government
has two great schemes on hand : the building
of a new Parliament House, which will pro-
bably cost half-a-million or thereabouts, and
the holding of a big Exhibition, which will
most likely swallow another £250,000 or more
of legal cornstalk tender. The Parliament
House, if it comes off, is to be built as usual
with borrowed money, and another slice of
Sydney’s great park is to be used up for the pur-
pose. Considering that one large piece has
already gone for Government House accommo-
dation, and another bit is to be used for a new
railway-station, this third great bite will leave
comparatively little of the once magnificent
property intact. The building of the new
Parliament House and the Exhibition will pro-
vide a lot of temporary work for the Sydney
unemployed, and make things humforatime, and
enable the Government to point with pride to the
activity which comes of a Free-raid regime.
The Exhibition will bring crowds of people to
Sydney and boom city property for the time
being, and increase the business of city shop-
keepers and hotel-keepers, and help to still
further congest population into the bloated
metropolis. And the country districts will
duly pay their half of the bill. The Parliament
House will yield no revenue and be merely a
dead and unsaleable asset all its davs, and
if Sydney doesn’t happen to become the
Federal capital, and the structure doesn’t
come in handy as the seat of the Common-
wealth Government, there will be nothing to
put in it save a species of glorified municipal
council. Most of the country population will
never even see the glittering white elephant,
and will feel no better if they do see it; never-
theless, their share of the bill for interest will
come in regularly for ever and ever. As for the
Exhibition, it is supposed to be paid for out of
revenue, by instalments spread over a series of
years, and the selector in the arid wastes out
back, and all the rest of the struggling, hungry,
joyless bush population, will be levied upon for
their half of that bill also. How the revenue
will stand the charge, seeing that it is already
far below expenditure and keeps declining, and
no provision is suggested for meeting the extra
outlay, doesn’t appear. If the revenue can’t
stand it, it will presumably come out of loan
moneys in the end, as usual. No special reason is
assigned for the present expenditure of about
£750,000 on useless gorgeousness in Sydney. The
alleged policy of the Reid Government is to
“ settle the people on the land,” and to
“ develope the interior,” and to “ open up the
country,” and to “ relieve the congestion of the
city,” and to promote decentralisation, and to
square the finances by strict economy, and
other equally beautiful facts and circumstances;
and the proposal to spend £750,000 or more on
needless pomp in the capital squares very badly
indeed with these ambitions. New South
Wales is miserably poor just now ; it
plain bread and meat, and decent roads, and
irrigation, and more railways, and more indus-
tries, and a better local market for its produce ;
and to give it two hunks of gorgeous architec-
ture and a razzle-dazzle in the city as an equiva-
lent for these urgent needs is mere mockery.
N.S.W. Judicial Relationships.
The gods must laugh a lot at N.S. W. Supreme
Court judicial relationships and their results.
In three jurisdictions—Equity, Divorce, and
Bankruptcy—the judge is practically judge and
jury, and it becomes of the greatest moment to
clients to gain his goodwill. Judge Owen sits
in Equity ; Judge Manning in Bankruptcy ;
und until lately Judge Windeyer sat in
Divorce. Before Judge Owen practises Mr.
Langer Owen, his son. Mr. Langer Owen
was admitted to the N.S.W. bar in ’89 —seven
years ago—as a junior barrister, and he has
acquired a bigger equity practice than any other
counsel admitted for the last 20 years. Before
J udge Manning practises Mr. R. K. Manning,
his nephew. Mr. R. K. Manning was ad-
mitted to the N.S.W. bar in ’B9—seven years
ago—as a junior barrister, and he has acquired
a bigger bankruptcy practice than any other
counsel save one. Before Judge Windeyer
used to practise Mr. Ralston, his son-in-law,
and Mr. Windeyer, his son. Mr. Ral-
ston was admitted to the N.S.W. bar in ’B4,
and at the late lamented judicial demise
of his father-in-law he had acquired the biggest
practice in divorce. Mr. Windeyer, admitted
in ’94—two years ago—had acquired the next
biggest practice. Since Judge Simpson took
divorce there has been, to put it mildly, no
noticeable increase in the divorce-briefs of either
Mr. Ralston or Mr. Windeyer. Judge
Simpson has a son who is available to practise
before him ; but it is understood that he ob-
jects to it, and the son doesn’t practise. Chief
Justice Darley’s son doesn’t practise before
him, for, though Judge’s associate for some
time, he never passed—perhaps he never
tried to pass—his legal exams. Now, no-
body, of course, says or suggests or believes
that there was ever the slightest suspicion of
improper influence as between these fathers and
sons ; but, all the same, clients and solicitors
will persist in thinking that there is some
influence in relationship that “blood is
thicker than water ” —and the matter is not
only a disgust to the briefless and unrelated
Bar, but something very like a scandal
on Justice. Anyway, it is now said that
Chief - Justice Barley, who is out of
the running, has formulated such a definite
objection to the habit that Judge Owen may
possibly be drafted to Common Law jurisdic-
tion ; Judge Manning to take his place in
Equity, Mr. A. H. Simpson to be elevated to
Bankruptcy. Anything will be an improve-
ment on the present state of things ; but, since
the Bar is 'either too much frightened or too
much hobbled to put its foot down in English
Bar fashion, that short and sensible prohibitory
Act of Parliament is badly wanted as a final
settlement.
Melbourne Post-Office Scandals.
A general belief that no punishment worth
mentioning can happen to any influential Mel-
bourne misdemeanant is confirmed in the result
of a Vic. Public Service Board enquiry re the
illicit sale of obsolete stamps by G.P.O. officials.
The enquiry disclosed pettifogging jobbery and
corruption, and serious betrayal of trust among
certain post-officers who drew substantial sala-
ries, not so much for the work they performed
as on account of the trust placed in them. They
were paid to be honest per regulations, and
they broke their contract with the department.
Being required not to sell stamps that had gone
out of public issue, they did sell such stamps
for the advantage of particular dealers, and in
one instance, at least, the delinquent sold them
for his own profit likewise. It was a dirty
business, as far as the evidence threw light upon
it. Probably a more searching and less sympa-
thetic enquiry might have shown it dirtier.
The Public Service Board passed gentle sen-
tences on these gentlemen, convicted of betray-
their trust under circumstances which gave
them no excuse for not going straight. The
highest paid officer of the crowd received
“actual punishment” to the extent of a for-
feiture of about 12 per cent, on his salary for
one year, whilst the chief distributor of stamps,
who was proved to have made money out of his
delinquencies, got off with a fine (payable in
what is practically easy instalments) equivalent
to .£3Bs—his salary being reduced from £485 to
£375 for a period which will entail that amount
of loss. A subordinate officer, who acted in
conjunction with him as a stamp-trader, was
fined £l6, whilst another and almost innocent
subordinate officer was handicapped—as horse-
reporters would say—at two pounds less. The
inevitable snort of public contempt followed
this judgment by the Public Service Board,
after which Premier Turner was requested to
make a few' remarks on the subject in the
House. Premier Turner’s opinion of P.S.B.
justice was expressed indirectly. He didn’t
say that a fine of £9O for the chief offender was
a scandalously cheap get-off for the gentleman,
but he said that the delinquent was no longer
fit to preside over the stamp department, or to
take the position of Deputy P.M.G., which
would have been given to him shortly but
for the recent revelations. As for the most
severely-fined offender, said the Premier, he
was properly shifted to another billet inasmuch
as he wasn’t fit to distribute stamps, and
his accomplice couldn’t be allowed to re-
main in the Income-tax office, “ where secrets
are supposed to be kept,” and would have to
serve the State in some other Government de-
partment. These remarks amounted, of course,
to a suggestion that the Public Service Board is
unfit to adjudicate in important trials of public
servants, therefore the Premier’s confession
that the P.S.B. is a despotic power, whose
sentences the Government is powerless to
amend, was just what The Bulletin has
learned to expect. Every insult heaped upon
common justice in Smellbourne seems to be the
outcome of an unfortunate mistake by which
something that ought to happen (and which
would surely happen elsewhere) is debarred
from coming to pass. Right, in Smellbourne,
is always regretting its inability to rectify
Wrong. Acts of Parliament invariably fail in
the one most important particular. There is
ever a serious flaw in the regulations, a fly in
the legal amber, or something or other that
prevents influential offenders from being satis-
factorily dealt with. And the uninfluential
persons, who don’t offend, are beginning to
want fair play.
A Denominational Champion.
H. H. Champion has broken out in a new place
with a wail for denominational education :
Every serious person knows perfectly well that the
existing State system of secular education is an expensive
failure. Its cost is enormous, and yet plenty of teachers
are bullied as well as underpaid.’ No one claims for it
that it tends to turn out good citizens, and all the evi-
dence goes to show that the effect of the lack of any kind
of religious or moral instruction for the young is disas-
trous to the best interests of the community One
obvious way out of the difficulty is to have an inspection
of religious schools by a State officer, and to allow a grant
of so much per head per annum for each child who
should pass the examinations satisfactorily.
This is most fatuous. No evidence is adduced
to prove that religion or morals can be inocu-
lated by any education system, nor that any
dogmatic system of “ religion ” or “ morals ” is
desirable. Champion’s scheme is still more
weird and weak, because it presumably is in
favor of giving the capitation grant to any reli-
gion whatever, no matter what its system of
morals might be. For instance, Kinsman, the
much-marrying man, is the head of a church, and
would want State aid right away. Then there is
another Melb. parson who has got in much
trouble for greeting the (young) sisters with a
holy kiss, and for inculcating sound religion by
holding the blushing neophytes on his knee.
He is quite willing to start schools for girls
(and boys ?) under 16—and to help to cut out
the State grant. Then the parsons of Orange
lodges would want State aid for their schools,
and a proper hatred for the Pope would thus be
taught out of the taxes. Presently the Mor-
mons of Salt Lake, and the Thugs of India, and
several quaint religionists from mid-Africa,
would come along to bless the name of H. H.
Champion. The idea that religious schools turn
out good citizens is very trustful. A few years
ago some Hawthorn (Vic.) boys were arrested
for a sexual offence. Some sectarian journals
immediately came out with homilies about the
godless system of Vic. education. But the
evidence showed that the boys were all scholars
at one religious school, and were not State
school boys at all. An instance like this shows
the folly of hasty conclusions. N. S. W. is not
“ godless ” in its education system ; it gives
facilities to clergymen to give religious educa-
tion to those children whose parents desire it.
YetN.S.W. crime statistics do not show any
advantage over Vic.—rather the other way, in
fact. But Champion admits that the “ Bible
in State schools ” does not meet his idea. Pre-
sumably, therefore, he wants to abolish the
State schools in favor of the church schools.
How can he make it compulsory for any child
to attend a church school? Vic. found it
necessary to make education compulsory, and
the necessary corollary was to make it free and
secular. Is Champion showing signs of com-
plete surrender to the W.C.T.U. ?
The N.S.W. Gag Department.
Some six weeks ago, in a highly injudicious
moment, and after having for a long time per-
sistently blocked applicants, New South Wales
Department of Alleged Justice promised to
produce the papers in the now notorious case of
Thomas Suffield, undergoing sentence of 10
years’ penal servitude for an assault said to have
been committed on a Lambton servant-girl in
1890. Apparently the Dept, regretted its pro-
mise as soon as made, and for five weeks nothing
more was heard about the matter, though, as
the papers were all together, and no manipula-
tion was required, there was no visible reason
why they should not have been produced on
the following day. If the Dept., however, hoped
that the matter would be forgotten, it was dis-
appointed, and the other day some of the papers,
with various important ones carefully omitted,
were actually laid on the Leg. Assembly
table. Judge Windeyer’s. report on the
case was not presented; nor was the review
of the case which Mr. Walter Edmunds,
counsel for Suffield, wrote at the request
of Justice-Minister O’Connor ; nor a striking
memorandum by Suffield himself (though
Minister Gould’s reply to this memorandum
was carefully included !); nor four important
affidavits, disclosing much new evidence in
favor of Suffield, alleged to have been buried
in the recesses of the Crown Law Office. With
these trifling exceptions, the papers seem fairly
complete. It is usual, with papers of strong
public interest or importance, to print copies
which are held for sale at the Government
Printing Office, and are supplied to members
of Parliament and the press. JVo copies of
the. papers in the Suffield case were
printed ; so the publicity given to the matter
by the injudicious action of the Department of
Alleged Justice will be the smallest possible.
As The Bulletin has already written, when
there is hint of injustice done to any man by
Botany Bay officialdom, all the forces of official-
dom league themselves together to keep the
man in his pigeonhole, the case from the light
of day. The Suffield case, it is considered,
has been definitely shelved for the just-ended
session of Parliament, and by next session
people will have forgotten all about it. Will
they !
New South Wales Government carried motions
in favor of referring to the Public Works Com-
mittee the building of Parliament Houses and
an Exhibition by 50 to 32 and 43 to 18 votes
respectively, and on each occasion members of
the P. W. C. voted with the Government. As
this committee is paid by sittings these votes of
its members can hardly be looked upon as wholly
disinterested. The jobs will be long, the emolu-
ments liberal. In a close division party enthu-
siasm might justify such votes, but, where the
numbers areas given, people are driven to think
that the predominant sentiment of the voters
was greed, and that next and very close to it
was a cynical disregard of the public opinion
they claim to express. The voters were within
their Parliamentary rights. But see the evil
of giving exceptional rights to members !
Tory opposition to the Saturday half-holiday
clause in the Vic. Factories and Shops Bill is
based upon a statement that compulsory closing
will mean ruin to small shop-keepers, wherefore
one councillor after another protests against the
awful injustice of permitting the question to be
decided by a “ bare majority ” on a trades vote.
They suggest, these benevolent old gentlemen,
that the wishes of the bare minority are in dan-
ger of being over-ruled by a combination of
bloated capitalists, who favor the clause afore-
said from selfish business motives. Why should
hundreds of small suburban shop-keepers be
sacrificed to the interests of large firms, asks
Wrixon the Righteous, and Wallace the
gold-bug. Only one councillor had the iutelli-
gence, or the inclination, to remember that
shop-keepers, as a rule, are small, not large. A
bare majority in support of the Saturday holi-
day will mean either that 45 per cent., say, of
these struggling individuals are voting for their
own ruin, or else that the Council “ gag ” is as
hollow as the heads and hearts of its utterers.
It is tolerably certain that the two-thirds
majority demanded by the Council (after 13
members stood out for a three-fourths majority)
will rush headlong to its alleged ruin.
In the interests of Australian humor, it is to
be deplored that the Sargood statue scheme
was not allowed to progress as far, say, as the
getting out of designs. The spectacle on
Princes Bridge of a bronze equestrian figure of
the glorified sock-seller waving his drawn
sword while his warhorse (not warehouse this
time) pranced gaily towards the cathedral
would be a sight to strike fear into the heart of
every foreign invader. Any party which erects
a statue to one of its leaders while he still lives
hasn’t sense enough to come in out of the rain.
Ten years ago it would have needed little effort
to arouse the rabid teetotallers of Victoria to
hoist an effigy of Jimmy Mirams in Collins-
street: and about that time, too, the Orange-
men of Sydney could easily have been persuaded
to perpetuate Francis Abigail in stone or
brass. Per fervid hero-worshippers should take
to heart the rule of the Roman Catholic Church,
by which canonisation cannot take place until
the projected saint has been dead two cen-
turies. By that time his little eccentricities
are forgotten, and the authenticity of any
documents in the case is almost impossible to
prove.
Under-Secretary J. G. Anderson, of Bris-
bane, who periodically whips the Education
Department up there for accidental errors in
literary English, blazons the phrase, “ an edu-
cated proletariat,” in his own calm and well-
considered official report on the state of
N.S.W. Primary and Superior Schools. “Pro-
letariat ” is not and never can or should be an
intelligible English word. “Proletariat!”
wrote a great scholar and philanthropist
on one occasion. “ I distrust the English-
man who applies the term to any sec-
tion of his countrymen. He has picked up
the word without knowing its meaning,
and uses it simply because it is long and
sounds learned.’ Sydney Domain spouters
run the word into every other sentence, and,
with infantile ingenuousness, employ it as a
suitable description of themselves and their
families. Had Mr. J. G. Anderson dragged into
his report “Heredity” and “Environment,”
the influence of the Domain upon him would
stand self-confessed.
Maoriland Tory papers remark, with painful
unanimity, that the Parliament just deceased
is the very worst the province ever had. Look-
ing back on the past 15 or 20 years, the present
writer can’t remember any Parliament in any
Australian province which wasn’t the very
worst Parliament on record, so the above state-
ment was only to be expected. Also he doesn’t
expect that there ever will be a Parliament
which isn’t the worst which Australia has seen
up to date. Likewise there isn’t a live states-
man who can compare with the statesmen who
are dead, and there isn’t likely to be. Yet,
despite the familiar wail of the local pessimist,
The Bulletin reckons that Kingston, Turner
and Seddon can compare without any dis-
advantage to the old politicians that Australia
weeps about so much now that they are dead,
and who were no great shakes when they were
alive ; and that Parliaments to-day are about as
good as they were 50 years ago ; and that the
giants of bygone times were about the usual
size. Looking back into the haze of our cheap
antiquity, it doesn’t seem as if these alleged
giants ever did anything so very enormous after
all. [P.S. —Since the above was written N.S.W.
Parliament has closed up, and the local Star
remarks that it is admittedly the very worst
Parliament that the province ever had. Like*
wise the Argus says something of the same
sort in Melbourne. The very worst Parlia-
ment and the oldest inhabitant and the largest
snake are a trinity, and the great man who is
dead is their near relation.]
The idea of a Government elected by Parlia-
ment is distinctly gaining ground in Maoriland.
The success of the Seddon Ministry is to a
great extent the cause. With the ordinary
kind of Parliament, where the ordinary
Parkes and the commonplace Robertson, or
the average Duncan Gillies and the plain,
dull Jimmy Munro, scramble for office, the
party system is not so utterly bad as it might
appear. The only way in which Parliament
can exercise any real influence over the Ministry
is by throwing it out, but Parkes and Robert-
son and Gillies and Munro were all so much
alike that the Legislature could swap Premiers
once a month and not notice the difference.
Therefore, if the sole means of keeping Gillies
or Munro in order was to throw him out he
could be thrown out without anybody being
noticeably the worse. A system where the
only real influence Parliament can exercise over
the Government is by casting it downstairs is
stupid enough, but if the Government is so
ordinary that half-a-dozen equally good ones
can be found at any time, and so commonplace
That no one misses it when it is gone
then the obvious policy is to cast it
down the stair and say no more about it.
Maoriland, however, is in a different situation,
the Seddon Cabinet is growing somewhat,
bounceable and autocratic as the result of much
success. The country can’t afford to throw it
out when the dreadful Russell clan is the
alternative. Therefore, the Legislature has
less control over Richard of Kumara than over
any previous Premier, and the need for an
arrangement which will enable it to have some
influence over Seddon grows more and more
obvious. The only influence provided under
the present system is to warn Seddon that, if
he grows overbearing, Russell will be put in
his place. But Russell is such a ghastly im-
possibility that the warning is obviously of no
account. As long as Russell is the alternative
there is hardly any bad or corrupt or stupid
thing that the present Cabinet couldn’t do if it
wanted to.

*’ IJOU . “ A Mother of Three.”
“Francillon,” staged by the Potter-
Bellew co. at Sydney Lyceum last Wednesday,
went straight to the great soul of the audience
as a wicked French play of the most soulful
description. Most other French plays reach this
country in a severely Bowdlerised condition, but
1 rancillon ” arrived practically naked and un-
ashamed, with. beautiful embroidery on its fig-leaf,
said fig-leaf being cut bias and having Valenciennes
round it. The audience was mostly girls, but
as “Francillon” is perfectly new to Australia
they came not knowing the rich and artistic
wickedness of it; if they had known they would
have brought other girls along with them. It was
wntten by the most morally tired man in France
-Dumas the younger; and it does all possible
credit to that brilliant personage. There is a high
social atmosphere about it; the cast includes a
count, a countess, a marquis, and a “ Baroness
Smith ” —presumably the wife of that Sir Smith
who constitutes the Frenchman’s main idea of the
British aristocracy. The story is built on the fact
that the count, who is newly-married to a beauti-
ful wife, goes out almost every night to riot along
with a loose personage whose hair is reputed to be
15yds. long; and comes home with the milk in the
small hours of a.m., with vine-leaves in his hair,
and wine-stains and old cigar-ash on his con-
science, and whoops openly about his sin. Then
one morning a mountain falls upon him, for his
pretty wife straggles in looking blase and worn,
and states that she went out last night also, and
went on exactly the same whoop, and dined and
drank and sinned the same old sin with a strange
man whose name she doesn’t know. She simply
saw him leaning up against a wall and asked him
to come along in a cab and sin—and, not being
Joseph of Canaan, he came. The lady tells this
story to her husband and his two male friends,
and her female friend, Baroness Smith, and they
send out for their relatives to come round at once
and hear further particulars.
* • * *
The lady also wants to know, reasonably
enough, why she shouldn’t sin as well as her hus-
band, and that staggered and infuriated trans-
gressor can only gasp, while his head swells up and
smokes with rage. Nevertheless it proves, after
the lady has boasted eloquently of her sin through
two acts, that she never sinned at all; she is really
a pure and noble woman with a magnificent gift of
lying, and a great capacity for detail. This story
is garnished with much gorgeous furniture, and
there are rich tapestry-hangings all round it, and,
after its own clever, gilded, weary, leprous fashion,
it points a gamey moral and teaches a lesson with
last week’s ash-barrel in it. The same lesson, or
one very like it, may be reached by keeping a cow-
liver too long on hand in the summer, 01 by not mak-
ing quite sure that the prawns are fresh ; and the
moral is mainly to the effect that the dog shouldn’t
be allowed to sleep under the bed into the hot
weather—especially if he is a large, muddy dog.
There are very few dull lines in “ Francillon ; ” it
is bright, clever, and well-constructed; but it
belongs to the yellow decadent school of art, and
there is a prematurely-old, affluent weariness about
it, and when it is over the auditor feels as if he
would like to wash the heroine to make her fresh
again, if that were possible. All the same, it is
the cleverest and best problem play up till now.
* * » *
Kyrle Bellew puts some of his very best
Work into this gaudy shriek of art. He holds the
audience even when he has the stage to himself
and keeps a dead silence; he expresses a
whole series of conflicting plans, ideas and
emotions by dumb show and facial expres-
sion ; and everything that can be done for the
particularly mean hero he does. Cyril Keightley,
as his factotum and fellow-sinner, also reaches his
high water-mark \ his Henri de Symieux is a very
fine performance; and though he isn’t at high
water-mark all the time he is mostly there. The
Countess of Mrs. Potter is a wildly erratic person,
with much of the paint dabbed about her eyes as
usual. She is strikingly good in some places, and
is j ust going to be good in many others when she
flies off the handle, and falls over her elocution,
or commences to whirl herself recklessly in the
Parisian atmosphere. The impression is that
most of the time she is on the verge of something
which she never really is, but whether she would
be any better if she were that thing, whatever it
may be, doesn’t appear. Cathcart, C. M. Berke-
ley, Miss Linda Raymond, and Mrs. Walter Hill
are the other successes of the piece, and Miss
Pollie Emery, in a sentimental character, is about
its most conspicuous failure. Miss Emery is a
born comedienne, and the sentimental girl in the
simple frock doesn’t suit her. “The Ironmaster”
is to follow on Saturday.
** * *
“ Face to Face,” which has taken the place
of the snake drama at Her Majesty’s, started to
very large business ; the late lamented reptile has
been a splendid advt., and if manager Cosgrove
only keeps up the gaudy horror prosperity seems
assured. Unfortunately, the horror already shows
signs of falling off. Beyond the shooting of a
toothless old gentleman in Act 1., and the suicide
of a depraved policeman later on, there is no body
in the present production, barring one which is
mentioned as having taken place some years pre-
viously. The scene is laid partly in Paris and
partly in some other city—apparently London—
and the falling of an avalanche in this latter place
seems unconvincing, somehow. Other things are
unconvincing also. Wilfred Shine, when he is
flying 1 from justice, comes back three times to the
scene of the crime, and stands still, saying in
agonised tones that he must fly, yet he doesn t fly
worth twopence. Also, when he stands off the whole
French police-force with a chair the police don’t
even strike an attitude ; they merely loom up in a
rigid perpendicular and dream. A decrepit English
showman who is taking a caravan round France
and who assaults and dreadfully mauls, on pat-
riotic principles, every Frenchman he meets, and
knocks over large quantities of gendarmes at
Sl ghf> grows distinctly wearisome ; when he
appears at one wing and six French policemen
march in at the other, it presently becomes an
understood thing that he will knock them all down
with one hand and make them humbly apologise
for being alive. And in the last act, when
Shine throws off his disguise and proceeds to
spank the wicked policeman in the presence
of his six or eight large, brutal accomplices,
not one of them even attempts a rescue. They
simply stand up in a row and see their boss being
spanked, and show themselves the most inefficient
crowd of ruffians on record. The fact that the
policeman, after he committed the murder, at
once writes and signs a full account of it—presum-
ably for reference in case he should forget the
details—and spends the rest of his life in a fruit-
less struggle to recover the document, and when it
is lost at once proceeds to write out another, is a
mere casual detail: being a policeman he
would naturally do things like that. “Face
to Face ” is a trifle more irrelevant than
the average, which is saying a great deal;
and the way the incriminating document is
left lying around loose is simply awful to witness.
John Forde, Tom Cosgrove, and Misses Lita,
Mowbray, and Fanny Wiseman are a good deal
better than some of the other people, and an un-
accountable rag infant which is finally dropped
somewhere and forgotten, when it really can’t
keep on pretending to be an infant any longer,
deserves honorable mention. It is the only mem-
ber of the cast who recognises the hopeless nature
of the position and takes the honorable course of
throwing up the contract and dissolving into its
original elements.
** * *
At time of writing (Tuesday, 17th Nov.)
there were generally understood to be ructions at
Her Majesty’s. At all events, one advt. an-
nounces that Williamson and Musgrove open the
big theatre on Saturday (21st) with a brief season
of the “ Trip to Chinatown,” which was such a
specially glorious boom at the Lyceum some time
ago. Another advt. says that William Cosgrove
regrets he can only play the present horror for
ten nights more, and that “ A Mother’s Sin ” (by
arrangement with Billolloway) will follow. As
these two events can’t both happen at once, there
seems reason to anticipate trouble. Rumor has it
that the new management’s representative called
round on Monday to start painting the “ Chinatown”
scenery, and that the old managementdispersed him
severely and told him to get his hair cut. After
that there are said to have been breezy altercations
on the front step and cries of “ Rats ” from the
crowd. The Bulletin has the above on the most
unreliable authority. It, therefore, seems at time
of writing a matter of some uncertainty which
show will appear on Saturday. Her Majesty’s is
a hard theatre to get anybody out of when he
doesn’t propose to go. A former management
hove quite a succession of lawyers and writs down
the steps with great success, and the mark of one
lawyer’s head is still visible where he bumped on
the stairway.
#* * *
Bland Holt has left Sydney Royal, after a
six months’season which can’t have been especially
profitable, for this time Bland has “ blewed ” his
good money on paint and scenery and horse even
more recklessly than usual—and B. Holt, even in
his ordinary parsimonious condition, piles up
scenery and glitter and expensive horse with
alarming disregard of consequence. The Bulletin
also casts the unobtrusive half-brick of personal
friendship after that able manager and reckless
cavalier, C. Simonsen, whom it regards as a
brother, and doesn’t charge him anything for the
loan of the relationship.
** * *
George Rignold takes possession of Sydney
Royal on the 28th with good old “ Henry V ” for
his opening piece. The Royal was the scene of
Rignold s first Australian appearance some 20
years ago, and his return should be an epoch in
local dramatic history—if Sydney is taking any
epoch just now.
** * *
In the matter of Jimmy MacMahon’s Cine-
matographe, public opinion seems to have finally
decided that the skirt-dancer fills the biggest void
under the aggregate waistcoat of the community.
Ihe street m Baris, where everything goes back-
wards, seems to come in a good second. This is
largely owing to the thrillsomeness of the cab,
which is always on the verge of bursting out of the
picture and rushing the audience, though the
bikist who dodges endways across the picture also
exmtes a lot of admiration. Several people have
already had bad falls through trying to bike just
like him.
** * *
The variety co. which blossoms perennially
at Sydney Tivoli, blooms in the spring with all its
wonted refulgence. A special line in the bill an-
nounces that Miss Alice Leamar has returned to
business after a severe illness, and is signalising
her restoration to health by singing “Tooral-lad-
de every night. The Vaidis sisters revolve on
the trapeze as madly as ever, and other things are
much as usual.
** * *
The last night of “Henry V.” at Melb.
Royal was patronised in a well-meant but painful
manner by the local Shakespeare- Society. A
group of elderly gents, wearing unheroic dress
suits and double eye-glasses, seized the oppor-
tunity of King Rignold’s entry into London to
present that mediaeval conqueror with an address
per Dr. Neikl, who, for his part, took the occasion
to make a speech. The speech and the address
would have been appropriate things to happen in
front of the curtain, but, as offerings to King R.
whilst he sat upholding the dignity of his position
upon a white horse, they were out of place. More-
over, the presentation committed another offence
against Art by inducing the heroic equestrian to
return thanks. This disillusion was hard to bear.
The monarch concluded a few remarks by inviting
his faithful barons, and the populace in general,
to give three cheers for “ Divine William,” after
which a 15th century varlet beat the air with a hat
of the period, and demanded a like number of
cheers for George Rignold. Happily the curtain
fell ere they had time to start “ God Save the
Queen. ”
» • * *
Henry Y. scored a point against the Mel-
bourne dailies by quoting a fair sample of the
style of notice served out to him : “ Mr. Rignold’s
performance is so well known that we will not say
anything more about it.” Such a notice does an
injustice to a big show revived after an interval of
12 years. In the case of “Henry V.,” for in-
stance, the performance couldn’t be well-known
to any Melbournians too young at the time
of the previous production to appreciate its
strength. The silliest thing in journalism is
a callow “ critic ” talking flippantly to his
youthful contemporaries about a poetic drama
which became stale to all of them in their
knickerbocker days. Injustice to the show-man
lies in the fact that young fellows are easily
persuaded of their old acquaintance with some-
thing they have never seen, but merely heard
their fathers speak of.
* * • *
The bill for this final week of the present
season at the Royal amounts to managerial revenge
upon degraded popular taste. The respectable
Bard has given place to “Work and Wages,” a
loose-jointed horror in five impossible acts and an
explosion. A cadaverous capitalist figures as chief
offender in “ Work and Wages.” He’s a bad man
and he has a bad time until he drops dead from
heart disease across the spikes of a felon’s dock.
Ihe humiliation of the trial, in which the Judge’s
summing-up lasts twenty seconds, and the jury
don’t retire to consider their verdict, and no form
of oath is administered to the witnesses, proves
too much for the prisoner, who has nothing
left to live for, anyway. He murdered one wife ;
another wife declines to live with him, because he
committed bigamy ; an angry parent is always
shooting at him with intent; his iron-foundry has
passed into the hands of an ex-foreman, who
divides 30 per cent, of the profits among the em-
ployes ; and there are further reasons why the
wretched man should welcome death. “Work
and Wages ” will give a good deal of pleasure to
ij c , unsympathetic majority ” that despises poor
old Shakespeare. It abounds in simple references
to the labor question, and may be taken seriously
or otherwise. Plimmer, H. W. Diver, Sweeney
Frank Harcourt, Prank Hawthorne, and Miss
Hughes deserve an approving sigh; also, a few
people unmentioned are quite capable of doing
better next time.

Bland Holt takes command at the Royal
on Saturday (21st), and for the next few weeks
that energetic identity will have no opposition in
his own line of business. He comes on the present
occasion with a strong assortment of melodramas
new to Melbourne, which are expected to add an-
other cubit to his managerial stature. “ One of
the Best ” will open the campaign.

“ Djin-Djin ” is about to leave Melbourne
for Adelaide, whilst the Lumiere cinomatographe
remains behind to appear elsewhere on its own.
On Saturday (21st) the band of variety artists
engaged by Arthur Garner for Adams’ ’all in
Sydney will appear at the Princess’s, and the
first Australian production of these said-to-be
first-class specialists is looked for with particular
interest.
** * *
Rickards, at the Opera House, intends to
put himself in the programme on Saturday, after
an absence sufficiently long to have created an
urgent public desire for his return to work. The
local world is prepared to greet its Rickards with
a burst of gratitude. Also, it is excited by an oft-
repeated assurance that Chirgwin is coming.
“A Mother of Three ” has already achieved
a third week at the Bijou, and will continue to
pay her giddy way until further notice. The Ex-
hibition Carnival is likewise still proceeding
although it doesn’t threaten to show a large surplus
in aid of Jewish charities. Fitzgerald Bros, con-
clude their contract with the Carnival syndicate
on Wednesday of this week, and the awful gap
left by the departure of the Fitz.’s double show is
to be filled with fireworks.

Haresfoot: “ Seeing Rignold’s Henry V. again, Ido
venture to say, what I would hardly say of Brooke’s
Othello, that George has accomplished the best rendition
of a Shakespearian hero. To be sure, not an
impossible one to act, but he is, point device, the very
man. He must feel like Elliston, acting George IV. in the

At Palmerston (M.L.) the Charles Godfrey Co. appears
to have worked two theatres, taking early turns at the
one place and late turns at the other, and vice-versa.
One ticket admitted to either show any hour of the per-
formance on the same night, so persons wanting twc
heljnngs of Godfrey, or the cinematographe (Lohr has
got hold of the inevitable ’graphe) could chase those
special items round the town.
The cinematographe is responsible for some exhibitions
of colossal cheek ”by amateur showmen. A Cine Salon
—a long, thin, ill-ventilated room—was opened inCollins-
street, Melbourne, the other week. The entertainment
consisted of 16 views displayed in a small frame, very

which Rickards includes in his variety entertainment.
Vet the public were asked to pay ls. a time for the
periodical production of those 16 second-rate samples of
a stole novelty, whilst the same coin would buy an
amphitheatre seat at the Princess’s, where the vastly
superror Lumiere cinematographe is given away with
“Djin-Djin.” J
With the now omnipresent ’graphe it was a case of first
come, best served. Rickards, at Melb. Opera House,
made a lot of money out of the picture-show that Carl
Hertz brought with him, ere the opposition had started,
pe Referee says of Fergus Hume’s farcical comedy,
Teddy s Wives,” exactly what this journal said of “ Trip
to Chinatown”—“the representation passed off briskly
enough, and was attended by repeated bursts of merri-
ment which were eloquent of the /enjoyment afforded. It
must be confessed that this enjoyment did not seem to be
shaied by the critics. There was not one who did not
seem to suffer from the bines as the representation pro-
ceeded. When, however, the public laugh, the critic
must he content to be temporarily effaced.”
George Walton and Co. were, it seems, pliyino
“Skipped” at Her Majesty’s Theatre, Carlisle, on the day
that V.R. beat George the Third’s reigning record. After
the first act the co. sang “ God Save the Queen,” where-
upon manager Walton wired the glad tidings to his
Sovereign Lady, who wired her royal thanks in return.
When old friend Walton reads this paragraph he must

Critic A. B. Walkley, in the Speaker, on the “ Duchess
of Coolgardie,” at Drury Lane “It shows that if you
are a comic Irishman (with song) you are sure to discover
nuggets of the very largest size and richest quality, and
that as soon as you have pegged out your claim any num-
ber of gentlemen will immediately come forward to buy
it for £20,000, which sum they carry handy in their
pocket-books. What is more, you will be able to detect
the wicked persons in a trice ; local custom compels them
to wear an eyeglass and talk French to simple miners who
haven’t even learned English. ... A young actress, from
Australia, I believe, Miss Hilda Spong, makes a good im-
pression as the heroine, serving out her beer to the rude
miners of Coolgardie with the native dignity of a lady
among the rabble rout of Comus.”
Australia can echo this wail from the Athkn'.kum :—“ A
curious and unsatisfactory sign of the times is the dearth
of young actresses capable of playing serious characters.
In this respect the state of the stage seems worse than it
has been during recent years. Such a state of affairs is
naturally the despair of managers. Promise has once or
twice been revealed, but has been unfulfilled. Rarely has
there been a time when the opportunities for success in
an overcrowded profession have been more brilliant than
now they are. The occasion does not, however, produce
the women.”
Two adjoining shows have come down to employing
ban-ackers on Saturday nights. The rivals stand at the
doors, and in real Richardson style yell the virtues of
their especial mummers into the ears of passers-by.
Douglas Powell, who, after his concert tour, visited the
Westralian fields, left Ivalgoorlie suddenly owing to a wire
notifying that he had been engaged for the part of Lucifer
in “The Golden Legend.” He hurried to catch the Orient
boat at Albany. Powell is somewhat of an amateur miner,
and his patient researches on the goldfields were con-
strued by the miners, who had heard of him as a vocalist,
as the fad of an eccentric Englishman. By the way,
Madame Bessie Cox (Mrs. Douglas Powell) is one of the
principal teachers of music in England.
Victorians will be pleased at the cable re Bertha Rossow’s
triumph on the English concert-platlorm. The late
Madame Patey, when here, was enraptured with the ex-
quisite quality of the young soprano’s voice.
“Billy’ Walshe, the well-known Australian tenor,
seems to have made a great success as Manrico, in
‘Trovatore” at the Comedy theatre, Manchester. He
was called before the curtain several times, and had to
respond to an undeniable encore fob his principal solos.
The melodramas Dampier has been producing at the
Melb. Aleck during the recent ill-fated season, avers a
Bulletin correspondent, are really first-class things in
their line, being streets ahead of many of Bland Holt’s
successes, as plays. With a little editing, good staging - ,
fair cast, and any other theatre but the Aleck, the days of
“ Thou shalt not Steal ” and “ To the West,” would have
been long in the land.
Miss May Glendinning, who was well-known and a general
favorite in Sydney musical circles a few years ago, has
returned from the unmusical North, and proposes to make
her voice—one with much melody in it so far as local recol-
lections go—again heard on the concert platform. Her
business address is at Nicholson’s music-warehouse.

The Bank of Australasia’s report shows a half-
year's profit of £40,568, and after paying away £40,000 in
a 5 per dividend there remains £568 to carry for-
ward. The profit is a considerable falling-off compared
with the four previous half-yearly returns of £41,158,
£40,854, £45,735, and £48,571. The Australasia, however,
has a magnificent cash reserve of over £3,100,000, and
cash and liquid assets together make nearly £6,000,000, so
its position looks absolutely impregnable.
* * * *
The Queensland National Bank, which now
owns up to being an utterly insolvent concern with a
shortage of 2J millions, even on the most favorable esti-
mate, and which wants the Government to see it through,
is just 24 years old. Its original promoter was a banker
from some rather indefinite “ foreign parts,” whose origin
seems to have been uncertain. It was managed almost
all its life by Drury, C.M.G., whose previous record was
that of a very small and unsuccessful branch manager
for an Anglo-Australian institution. It is commonly
reported that the very first entry made in its books on the
first day of its existence was the granting of an overdraft
to a director, but this may have been mere calumny.
The Q.N.8., according to the present appearance of
things, ceased to be altogether sound many years ago.
In fact, it is doubtful if it ever was sound. It seems to
have had a habit of taking a sanguine view of its bad
debts, and regarding its losses as assets long after their
real condition ought to have been apparent. It was run
for years by politicians with big overdrafts, and propped
up with Government money, and, despite the gorgeous 15
per cent, dividends of its good times it would appear to
have been more or less of a lie and a clumsy
“ fake ” all its days. It was known up North in the
old gold-boom era as a most reckless granter of
overdrafts on weak security, and a most desperate
supporter of sad little boom townships which lived
on their alleged “ magnificent future.” The Queens-
land coast is dotted with comatose, sweltering, fly-infested
townships which have always been just going to rise to
immediate greatness, where the inhabitants lived by
selling allotments to each other at exorbitant prices, and
drinking together, and discounting each other’s bills, and
the Q.N.B. used to find the money for nearly everything.
The report that announces the practical insolvency of the
woefully mismanaged institution doesn’t mention that
anybody is to blame for the collapse, or that anybody is
responsible for the fact that the concern is about £2,500,000
worse off than its balance-sheet showed, and there is no
suggestion about anyone being prosecuted. If there
was a prosecution and the whole history was told
from the beginning, it ought to be a most
astonishing and smellful yarn. A bank which is
directed by two ex-Premiers (one of them also an ex-
Acting-Governor, K.C.M.G., and President of the Leg.
Council), one M.L.C. and an influential “Esq.,” and
which was general-managed by the local Commander of
the Forces, and which used to give overdrafts of
£lOO,OOO or so to big politicians, can’t be ripped up
without breaking society into small pieces.

The report of the Temperance and General Life
Assurance Society (ordinary department) for the year
ended 30th September is a good deal worse than usual.
Renewal premiums are £27,463, compared with £27,681
and £28,037 for the two previous years, so that the new
business for these two years has all been swallowed up by
claims and surrenders. The new premiums, however
(t'5259), are £l6OO better than in ’95, which is a solid im-
provement—about the only one to be recorded. Though
the income is nearly £2OOO larger this year than last, and
the claims are £l9OO smaller, the amount saved and added
to the funds is only £15,473, whereas last year it was over
£17,000. Working expenses are £10,885, against £8133
last year ; that is to say, the Temperance and General
seems to have collected £l6OO more premiums and spent
over £2OOO more to do it. Expenses this year are fully
33 per cent, of premiums, which is an awful jump
in the wrong direction from the 25 per cent, of last year ;
25 per cent, was decidedly too high, and the present 33
per cent, is unspeakable—or thereabouts. Some of the
items are perplexing ; commission on renewal premiums
goes up £3B, though the amount of renewal premiums is
less; and agency expenses rise at one fell swoop from
£337 to £ll9l.
Interest on investments (.£6783) is less than 4
per cent, on the funds actually invested, which is a very
small percentage indeed. Surrenders, which are always
a depressing feature in insurance business, have increased
greatly. Altogether, there is absolutely nothing of a
cheerful nature in the report, so far as The Bulletin can
see, save the increase in the new business, and that
increase seems to have cost a great deal more than it is
worth. There are too many life assurance societies in
Australasia for the business to be done, and the fierce
competition forces up expenses. The expense rate of the
Temperance and General suggests strongly that it is one
of the superfluous institutions.
The Temperance and General also runs an in-
dustrial department (the threepence and sixpence a week
business) and the necessity of saying something severe
about that department sticks out conspicuously. Pre-
miums (£8242) are £lO2 better than last year, interest
(£1258) is £lB7 worse. Expenses (£4489) are more than
half the premiums; in other words, for every shilling
paid into the society the customer gets less than 6d. worth
of assurance and more than 6d. worth of office expenses.
In ’95 the expenses, for practically the same amount of
business, were only £3301, so in this department also
things have gone the wrong way with great suddenness
and energy. The total funds have declined, as the result
of 12 months’ work, from £35,000 to less than £33,000, so
the industrial business, with a total income of £9500,
didn’t even contrive to hold its own. Altogether, there
is a serious lack of anything cheerful in either department
of the T. and G. Society’s business, and especially there is
a great want of any sufficient results to set against the
alarming increase in expenditure. This remark applies
to the industrial branch even more than the other ; apart
from the charges of the quinquennial investigation it
seems to have bought £lOO more premiums with £9OO
more expenses.
* » * «
The Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co. reports
a, remarkably good year. Net premium income (£66,400)
is £5OOO better than last year and £9OOO better than the
one before. The profits are £8789, and previous balance
makes the amount available £13,904. A 5 per cent, divi-
dend absorbs £1875, £lO,OOO goes to start a reserve-fund,
and £2029 is carried forward. The only depressing feature
in the balance-sheet is the return from investments ; the
co. has £37,000 in “ fixed deposits, Government deben-
tures, and bank balances,” and £10,200 in “ loans on
mortgage and other investments” ; total, over £47,000.
Against this there is an income from “ interest, fees, &c.,”
all lumped together, of £1337 7s. Bd. If interest yields
£1330, and only the £7 7s. Bd. is left for fees and &c., even
this only means a return of £2 17s. per cent., which is a
very small yield indeed. Perhaps, if the Colonial would
separate the interest from the fees and the &c. and show
the investments apart from the current account balance,
things might look a good deal better. The Colonial
Mutual Fire Co. is now in its eighteenth year, and is
getting on a solid basis after a stormy career which once
threatened to wipe it out. Four years ago it had no re-
serve and was nearly £20,000 to the bad—the natural
result of insuring people with eyes too close together and
a hooked nose in between —but since then it has pulled
up wonderfully.
* * * *
Melbourne Argus rises to point out that the
Turner Government’s State Bank will burst up Victoria
for good : —“More vicious and unsound proposals could
scarcely be imagined. It is actually proposed to seduce
current account customers from the banks, and to use the
money obtained from them, notin the promotion of trade,
industry, and settlement, as banking money ought to be
used, but partly for the construction of public works, and
partly in the purchase of Government securities. In
other words, if Mr. Turner’s State Bank can wrest
£2,000,000 of current account money from the ordinary
banks, it is to hand nearly all the funds so obtained over
to the Government for employment. Never has the world
before been entertained with such an insane proposal as
that a State Bank shall absorb the floating capital of the
country, withdraw it from profitable enterprise, and give
it to a Government to be spent on Government objects. .
. . Now, let us explain why we call the clauses (particu-
larly clause 83) relating to the ‘ current accounts divi-
sion ’ of the proposed State Bank ‘ wrecking clauses.’
Mr. Turner thinks that the State Bank would attract
£2,000,000 from the other banks. But what batiks?
Hardly the three large banks which successfully weathered
the storm of 1893. . . The three banks in question might
indeed lose a little, but Mr. Turner’s £2,000,000 would be
mostly drawn away from the rest of the banks, whose
current accounts present a total of £4,850,000. These
banks could not, however, lose two-fifths of their current
account balances without having to call in advances to a
corresponding amount. The loss of so much cash would,
moreover, excite great alarm, and further heavy with-
drawals would be made b\' persons who, losing faith in
both the banks and the Government, would hoard. The
inevitable result would be that some of the banks, includ-
ing Victorian banks, would have once more to cfose their
doors, never probably to open them again, and the colony
would be plunged into much greater trouble than it was
by the crisis of 1893. The credit of the colony would also
be destroyed for a considerable time.”
The Argus evidently thinks that cash in the
hands of the State, “to be used for Government objects,”
is a great deal less safe than cash in the hands of private
banks to be used in the private object of giving over-
drafts to people who pay sd. in the £, or to Longmuir, or
Munro and Co., or the Davies land companies. But the
wildest joke of all is the picture of the Vic. reconstructed
banks smashing up generally because a possible £2,000,000
is withdrawn from them and put into the State Bank.
The National Bank alone could spare half the amount out
of its liquid assets, and, as the withdrawal will be very
gradual, at the worst it is hardly likely to be felt. More-
over, the State Bank, in case of a crisis, is pledged to
prop up the private institutions with legal-tender paper
on very easy terms, so if the private banks did lose
£2,000,000 in gold they could get, if necessary, a much
larger amount in a currency which would serve their local
purposes equally well. The State Bank is much more
likely to save the local institutions from going bung than
to wreck them ; and, considering the provisions in
Turner’s scheme for assisting these depressed establish-
ments, the Aegus’s outbreak is a beastly piece of in-
gratitude.
• * * *
Shiels, M.L.A., objects to the State undertaking
the responsibilities of banking on the ground that “ bank-
ing demanded a special aptitude and training, special ex-
perience, and a firm and resolute attitude of resistance to
the influences which would be brought to bear against the
Govt.” Sublime—considering that scarce]}' a week had
passed since a board of directors had escaped criminal
punishment mainly on the ground of their want of know-
ledge of the concerns of their bank, of their extreme
pliability in the hands of a (fortunately defunct) manager,
and of their incapacity to resist his artful pressure.
* * * *
The Vic. Government has decided that it can’t
crowd through its entire State Bank scheme this session,
and it proposes merely to pass—if the Leg. Council per-
mits—the clauses providing for the establishment of a
State Land Bank, and postpone the rest till next session.
Therefore the ensanguined riot about the awfulness of a
State paper currency takes a well-earned rest. This
State paper question has three aspects: (1) The banks
allege that they don’t make any profit out of their note-
issue ; (2) They demonstrate by great masses of figures
that the State must make a loss out of it ; (3) They hang
on like grim death to the allegedly unprofitable privilege,
and, despite their undisguised hatred of the State Bank,
they fight like tigers to prevent it making the loss afore-
said. In fact, so deep and vast is their self-abnegation,
they would rather have the loss themselves.
* * * «
At Dec., 1895, the buildings, goods, and chattels
in the Sydney metropolitan area were fire-insured for
£59,720,282. Of this amount, which represents an enor-
mous premium income, £25,234,000 is in the hands of
English and other foreign companies, and £31,000,000 is in
the hands of companies belonging to places outside Aus-
tralia and Tasmania. The fire-insurance business repre-
sents the curse of foreign capital in. its worst form. The
big foreign co. only needs to bring into the country enough
money to furnish an office, and hang out its honored
name on a shingle, and hump away the profits for ever
afterwards. It gives no security and renders no service
that the local co. couldn’t do equally well, and the local
co. spends its profits in the country and they go into cir-
culation again, and help to keep up the national pros-
perity, whereas those of the English institution disappear
over the horizon and come back no more. It would be
interesting to know how many millions of good Australian
money has gone in this one leakage since the business
began. What fatted M.L.O. is game to start, in his own
interest as a shareholder, an agitation for a heavy tax on
the foreign fire insurance co. ? For this time only The
Bulletin will go with the fat M.L.C.

Looking back now on the events of ’93 Victoria
would give about £1,000,000 in hard cash to have had
Dibbs for Premier then instead of the ghastly Patterson.
Dibbs’s bank-note legislation and issue of State paper
saved two Sydney banks from going ker-wallop and let
the smash down easily; Patterson lost his head and
allowed things to go. If the Dibbs legislation had been
applied in Melbourne the National, Victoria and Ballarat
banks would never have suspended, and the difference
that would have made would have been tremendous.
N.S.W. is grateful to Dibbs —so grateful that it promptly
threw him out of Parliament. But he is to manage the
amalgamated Savings Banks at £2OOO a year.

Just now Sydney is full of people who have
come from the West by cheap excursion trains. Few' are
in a hurry to return to the heat and flies out-back (w'rites
a Bulletin correspondent); consequently many return-
tickets to Bourke, Cobar, and other places, are, despite
law-an’-order, available at cheap rates. Registry-office
keepers buy many of these tickets—often as low as five
shillings. The ordinary fare to Bourke is £2 10s. 2d., and
registry-offices are almost daily despatching servants to
the West. They provide the tickets and deduct the full
price from the Westward-bound governess’s or slavey’s
magnificent salary of 10s. a w'eek or thereabout.
For concentrated gall, take the average mining-
expert. Two of that ilk, who have been examining S.A.
mineral country, lately blasphemed Premier Kings' on and
co. in the ever-available columns of the Tory press because
S.A. Govt, declined to allow mining drummers to travel
“ on the never.”

The ticks, droughts, and other plagues are
playing sad havoc with northern station properties. The
other day was sold Glenvale station, area, 640 sq. miles ;
rent, £3OO per annum (paid in advance); 10,000 cattle and
140 horses, with numerous improvements, for £l5OO (3s. a
head). Situated about 140 miles from the Towers—an
excellent fattening run. The mortgagee lost a cool
£lO,OOO over the sale.

The S.A. Govt, intends to organise a comprehen-
sive scheme for advancing seed wheat through district
councils to the farmers who have been ruined by
, drought. The figures of the present season read thus :
Sown for wheat, 1,500,000 acres; cut for hay, 500,000
acres, estimated yield of wheat from the remainder
2,000,000 bushels ; needed for food, 1,970,000 bushels;
wanted for seed, 1,500,000 bushels; shortage, 1,470,000
bushels. Ordinarily, about 3,000,000 bushels are exported.

“Sentinel,” from Gundagai, N.S.W. : “The
mines here having been persistently boomed, the inevit-
able result has followed. Poor men, with wives and large
families, heard of the new Eldorado, hastened hither, and
are now huddled on the river flats, in many cases under
calico not sufficient to cover a large wheelbarrow. Day
after day they look for food by the wayside. Another
rush is now taking place on account of the new bridge,
just started, at which there is little chance for unskilled
labor. But there is no law to punish the boomster who
encourages this state of things.”

The magnificent report on the Girilambone
copper-mine, N.S. W., has been followed by intimations
that the shares are selling at 10s. each, and are recom-
mended at that price. It is also declared that before
many months the mine will be paying regular divs.
Capital £50,000, which is nominal, as the shares have been
issued as paid up to 17s. 6d. That does not furnish much
money to work a copper-mine. “ A sample of surface ore,
broken off by Mr. Bennett in my presence, gave 23 per
cent, copper by assay.” Nor is that the way to sample a
copper-mine.

Sofala, N.S.W.: “ The monthly escort left this

Great news at last from Mt. Gahan mine, Pam-
bula : “ The Co. has received a special medal and certifi-
cate from the World’s Fair Exhibition at Chicago.” Why,
in the face of this, are shares being forfeited for a 3d. call?
“ Damn Chicago ! ”
* * * *
Barraba, N.S.W. ; “The famous Dodger mine,
Crow Mountain, has crushed 23 tons of stone yielding a
total of 210 oz.” But how many crushings have they had
this year ? If the mine is famous it is simply infamous
not to keep on crushing.
Overflow mine, N.S.W. : “Struck rich oxide of
copper bottom of main shaft about 18in. wide.” It would
need to be fairly rich. Muudy, a well-known copper-
man,. is examining the property, and John Howell
follows. It is time something definite was known about
this show. Some heavy talk has been done about it,
chiefly by interested squatters, and the average squatter
knows about as much of mining in any form as the
average miner knows of sheep.

Cabled that the Perseverance G.M. Co., to work

may have a future ; its past has not been up to much.

The Howell’s Consolidated G.M. Co., announced
in last-week cables, is to take over mines known as the
Dust Hole and Just-in-Time, at Junee, N.S.W., and the
Prince of Wales, near Gundagai, on the recommendation
of John Howell. As nothing has come from Howell about the
two-foot vein of “almost solid silver” alleged by the papers
to have been hit in the White Rock mine, the news is a
little too soon, and must be put down to wind or whisky.

The Empress of Coolgardie mine has struck
something at last : “ A big deposit of cobalt and nickel
ores. There are some thousands of tons of ore in sight.”
Not a soul will believe it, so, if true, every chance will be

Quite a booiny report wired across by the chair-
man of the General Gordon mine, W.A. : “ Samples taken
promiscuously from drive averaged over soz. to ton.
Prospector’s shaft : Samples from drive gave over 21oz. to
ton.” Crushing-expectations are now centred on next
month, and everything about the battery is going on all
right under the engineership of Allison Smith, formerly
locomotive-engineer of Vic.” The market did not respond
to this report. The public, whatever the G.G. mine may
turn out to be, have very little faith in the crowd running
it.

From Menzies: “Things are very dull here.
The announcement that 80 miners were wanted to open
up a number of reefs at the 4-Mile was the signal for a big
rush. I had a stroll over the ground, and saw nothing to
justify expenditure. One of the biggest things here in
the way of spending money is the Menzies Group. A big
collapse here for a number of mines as soon as the bat-
teries get to work.—B.S.”
* * * *
A deluge at last. Kalgoorlie: “The Brown
Hill Extended has struck a supply of water estimated at
85 gallons daily.” Not a word about “the pumps are
working well,” so as to assure people who have relatives
there that all danger of a flood has been provided against.
Gov. Gerard Smith, of Westralia, talking at
Melb. Mayoral banquet last week, advised Easterners not
to be led into believing that all the mines of his province
were “ what are vulgarly termed 1 white cats.’ ” People
present wanted to laugh.
* * * *
A recent Westralian law decision makes legal
managers of mines responsible for workmen’s wages.
There is talk of appealing against the decision, but just
think what a fine old time an invisible company and an
irresponsible manager might have if the law were not as
laid down !
* * * *
“ Kalgoorlie,” says a Hannan’s correspondent to
The Bulletin, “ has gone to the dogs. The Stock Ex-
change and commercial business are dead, and unem-
ployed fill the streets. Wages are down in every business,
trade and profession. Miners are getting now only £3
per week in some places—without water. The old cry of
‘ Wait till the railway comes’ being ‘ hoff,’ the boomsters
are now shrieking ‘Wait till the general exemption is
over.’”
* * * *
The Westralian Govt, may, to all appearance,
be compelled, ere long, to provide relief works for the
unemployed in Wild-Cat Land Yet laborers for Westralia
—in batches of 100 at a time—are being advertised for in
Melb. papers ! Is this merely a paradox —or something
worse ?

After some good crushings and-one or two divs.,

W.A. Govt, has decided on the usual exemp-
tions—six weeks for all the fields save those in the Far
North, which are allowed eight weeks. This will give
breathing time to hundreds of worthless working mines,
throw thousands of men out of work, will not be availed
of by the gold-producing mines, and will in a number of
ways prove the great richness of the mines that can’t
afford to work. The exemptions are a God-send to the
Ministerial and other boomsters with W.A. mines for sale
in London. The man who wants to sell a mine usually
has to work it, and if lie gets six weeks exemption all the
gold is left in the mine for the new company.

The much-vaunted Big Blowis,orhas been idle—•
under labor suspension conditions. And what has become
of the Australasian mine, within a couple of miles of Cool-
gardie Post-office, which, according to that awful person
“ Smiler,” had in sight enormous quantities of lOoz. rock ?
Tub Bulletin hopes that no one has walked away with
that mine.

Clarke and Co., of Adelaide, have just issued an
exceptionally full number of their periodical Shark List
and Investors’ Guide, also a supplement dealing with
Westralian stocks. The Bulletin doesn’t endorse Clarke’s
theory that the inadequacy of working capital provided
by Australian promoters is “at the very root of the re-
cent market collapse,” but a quantity of solid information
in the circular will he found very useful.
» * * *
Stated in Clarke and Co.’s monthly circular,
which, by the way, is incomparably the best stock-and-
share list in Australia, that very conflicting reports are
flying about regarding the General Gordon mine, W.A.
Interested persons have declared it equal to the Great
Boulder. This may be dismissed as a cram. Others say
good gold went down some distance, and that the
stringers in the formation were very rich, but the mine
has not responded well to further development. The
market has accepted the latter version. Why not get
some well-known and disinterested man to examine and
report? Whatever the parent mine may turn out the
G.G. pups appear to be a most unpromising lot.
* * * *
The Brilliant (C. Towers) is well named. Last
month’s return, 2)13 tons, 30170 z. ; div. equal to £4333.
Total since the mine struck gold eight years ago, 175,000
tons, 218,0000 z., value £750,000. Divs., £349,000.

Queensland mines—Papuan, 590 tons, 12570 z. ;
Victoria G.M.A., 3 )g tons, 72,)0z. ; Queen Cross. 270 tons,
5640 z. ; Croydon Consols, 420 tons, 16830 z. ; Victoria and

Mills United, Charters Towers, 4850 z. from 407
tons—a substantial improvement. Levels on a good body
of mineralised stone are being driven, and the future is
brighter.

Brilliant Block, C.T. The returns have again
fallen ; the good ore over No. 6 level is exhausted.
Brilliant Extended, 2192 tons, 15130 z.

The recent rich returns from the principal Croy-
don mines point to that field as amongst the first four m
Australia.

Anticipated by Brisbane Telegraph that a
silver mine second to Broken Hill will soon be an estab-
lished fact within 100 miles of Brisbane. It is known as
the Monisdale silver mine, and was known some years
ago, but recent work, it is said, has shown its richness.
* * * *
Stated that the first four tons crushed from the
Champion mine, not far from Mt. Morgan, have gone Boz.
to the ton, and great excitement prevails at Mt. Morgan
over the result.
* * » *
The good old Victory, Charters Towers, is
likely to come again. The first breaking down of 20 tons
from the Victoria reef is thought to be 3oz. “tack.”
Reef, which has been a consistent div.-payer in the
next mine, averages 15in. Big enough for big divs. at
3oz.

Smithfield, £7BOO ; No. 4 North Phoenix', £2500 ; Phoenix

Phoenix, £lOOO.

Mt. Morgan for last month 99(5(5 tons, 11,1260 z.
» * * *
Boldly stated in print that it will probably be
found that the recent crushing from No. 9 Golden Gate,
Croydon, was brought about by encroaching on the
boundary of the Consols mine.
* * * *
From Cooktown : The leader of a New Guinea
prospecting party declares that the published accounts of
gold-returns from there have been exaggerated—the total,
so far, is about 900 oz. He would lie sorry to see a rush by
men badly equipped.
* * * *
The output of silver in Bananaland is also
slightly on the increase. 1895 gave 225,0190 z., yielding
£30,042 as against £22,077 obtained from silver in 1894.
Nearly all obtained from Herberton and Ravenswood.
Tin is in a bad way, 1894 only turning out 2871 tons, worth
£102,277, as against 2114 tons, worth £68,133 in 1885.
Total value of Queensland tin up to date, £4,325,771.
Melb. Herald announces that the directors of a
recently-victimised mining co. will not take criminal pro-
ceedings against the persons alleged to have salted the
mine, owing to legal difficulties and the monetary respon-
sibilities such proceedings would entail. Is it, then, to
be understood that in Melbourne, if any person contem-
plates committing a crime, he has only to make any
attempt to convict him sufficiently expensive to enable
him to set about his crime without any misgivings as to
gaol ?
* * * *
What has become of the Victorian Mt. Morgan
that so mdch was heard of three months ago? The man
who reported so well of it has predicted similar big things
for South Australia, and his big things, on paper, have
become monotonous.

Vic. mines : Long Tunnel, 2156 tons, 19430 z. ;

Another claim has struck rich gold specimens in
the Grow Mountain country, N.S.W., “ rivalling those of
the famous Dodger mine.” And what has become of the
famous Dodger ? Why doesn’t it crush ? To keep a mine
rich, don’t let a battery monkey with it.

visit to England of a detachment of N S W
mounted rifles : • ‘ ' ’
d( ? n ° real gpod-rather harm ; and it is really
for the glorification of a few “sassiety” officers at head
quarters. The country officers wish the thing had never
been passed. What is to be done with this £l5OO ? Is it
to be divided pro rata amongst our eight half-companies?
I rather suspect that some pet half-companies, run as
family concerns, cannot raise the £320, and that the}' hope
to get it out of the £l5OO which the Government is to
supply. There seems to be a bit of hole-and-corner work
about the financial arrangements. Tenterfield and
Inverell conjointly carried off and won permanently the
Hutton Shield in 1893-4-5. Inverell this year produced
the best shot in the regiment, and was only two points
behind the best shot in the province. Tenterfield, at Bris-
bane, recently carried off nearly all the chief events from
the Queenslanders, at a tournament. Yet the Inverell
men at the recent Duff competition, because a team had
the misfortune to get its horses lamed (and thus lost the
event), were told openly that they were a disgrace to the
commanding officer (!) and to the regiment.

Col. Farnell (is it Colonel —or General ?) is

framed on the models supplied by the London
wire-puller of the Australian dailies, J. Bull would
get something like this :
Brisbane, Nov. 6.—Gov. Lamingtons baby, Brisbane
Bill, is reported to have cut a tooth.
Sydney, Nov. 31. —There is a strong public feeling that
ex-Judge Windeyer ought to get one, if not two, seats on
the Privy Council.
Mr. John Smith has written a letter to Dandaloo Ex-
press, expressing the opinion that Lord Salisbury “ dunno
where ’e are ” on the Eastern Question.
The information supplied last week that Skipper had
won the Melb. Cup is officially denied.
Sydney, Nov. 16.—The contest for the supremacy of the
next world between Card. Moran, of Sydney, and Wra.
Goulburn was stopped by the referee after 43 rounds had
been fought.
At a banquet given to Sir George Reid last night by a
number of land-owners, the Premier requested the com
pany to call him Geo rge.

Last week a young Sydney solicitor (newly
fledged) was made a Commissioner for Affidavits
by Chief Justice Darley, said young attorney
being a son of ex-Judge Windeyer. And yet
there are more than 20 solicitors of older standing
than the new appointee down on the list awaiting
appointment as Commissioners.

STIMULATING JUSTICE.

being drunk and disorderly. How do you

PRISONER : "Not Guilty; and I desire to know
whether it is the wish of the Bench that I am
to get a fair trial? ”
BENCH : “ Certainly. You will get British justice
and fair play.”

A N.Q. country paper, a few days ago,
stated that its respected townsman, Mr. E. J.
Bottlenose (who was seriously ill), was slightly
better when they went to press, and that he would
most likely pull through provided fermentation
did not set in. Now, most of the residents knew
that Bottlenose lived on it, so, whilst some won-
dered if it meant inflammation, others laid wagers
as to how much over-proof it would be.
At Footscray,
Melb., a mutton-
truck driver, whose
duties necessitated
his rising at 1 a.m.
and working till 3

with leaving with-
out notice, and fined
20s. with 235. 6d.
costs. Had the
master “swopped”
him without notice,
if he could have
raised 2s. 6d. to issue
a summons (a big job
on 10s. a week), the
verdict would have
been a week’s wages

Queensland’s present agony grows out of
whether or not Governoress Lamington should be
addressed in society as “ Her Excellency. ” It is
learnedly pointed out by a churlish faction that
the Constitution Act provides but one representa-
tive of Her Majesty, and that as Lord L. is
one the Governoress would be two. This seems
cogent, but when Jersey was in N.S.W. he in-
variably used “we” as indicating the representa-
tive body at this end in all social affairs.

Dear Bulletin, — As a poor devil strug-
gling more or less
unsuccessfully to
get a living,
I honest-
lybelieve
that 50
per cent,
of the
houses in
certain
Sydney
suburbs,
which
bear the
legend
“ Furnished
Apartments,”
“ Vacancies,”
are more-or-less
used for ‘ ‘ immo-
ral purposes.” At
the present time the
furnished - apartmenter
runs a horrible risk of be-
ing pointed out as a thing
that lives upon women; and
of having his wife insulted by libi-
dinous policemen and others. A
man or couple may live in one of these
i houses for a month in absolute ignorance of
its character, as in most cases the “camels”
don’t live on the premises, but drop in quietly
after dark, the friends following a few yards
behind. Should the respectable lodger happen
to pass within a stone’s-throw of a row, “the
polaceman on the baate ” promptly runs him
in, and next morning flattens out the defence
with: “The prisner, yer Washup, lives wid a
wooman in a house av illfame beyant the fish-
market forninst Macblethery’s pub.” Then you’re
done. — Hekmes.

the matron’s buying biscuits without his authority
was the source of offence, while the matron counter-
allegeS that the persecution against her originated

The striking Adelaide doctors were very-

Yic. Gov. Brassey, in the rdle of the
Humble Governor:—
My constitutional position is one which is most con-
genial, and demands of me what I am most happy to dis-
charge—the duty of believing, as Ido believe, that the
majority in Victoria know a great deal better what is best
[or their local interests than I can possibly know.
Bike journalism, you notice, is fearfully
and wonderfully aggressive in its advocacy of
biking, whilst every creature who rides a machine
seems to be a rabid missionary trying to ram his
new gospel down the throats of the unconverted.
In point of fact, confirmed bikists are unsober
persons—intoxicated with the exuberance of their
own velocity—and not to be taken seriously. They
protest too much that they are deriving new life
and happiness from the exercise, whereas appear-
ances, at the end of six months or so, suggest that
their original condition of comparative ill-health
and misery suited them better. This is certainly
true of many girl-riders, “improved ” from plump,
kissable charmers into wan and weary ghosts of
the past.
Talking of “ cyclodonahs Melb. Herald
published some highly suggestive letters on this
delicate subject awhile ago. The writers in every
case, being very anxious not to say what they were
actually stating in so many words, reminded one
of the discreet Crackles. They knew enough to
make them blush, but they weren’t agoin’ to tell.
Some of the new

of sporting the two let-

N. S. Wales pannikin-

notices all over his shed,
and on every gate and
every second tree round
the homestead, to air
his acquired honor ! A
few of them: “ Sheerers

Liar, J.P.” “Raffells,

Among the influences making for an Exhi-
bition at Sydney in 1899 is a semi-official estimate
that, apart from manual labor, over 1000 billets will
be created in and about the building. As there
will be at least 20 applicants for each billet, all of
whom regard themselves as likely to succeed, an
army of 20,000 Exhibition-claqueurs at once stands
forth. Another influence strongly in action is
that of those who see titles, from C.M.G.’s up, in
the business.

DISBETT ROBINSON (to Barnacle Jones) : “And why did our friend Barnacle Smith leave
the Red Tape office?”
“Ah, well, you see, he used to come in, put his name down, and go away. But he got care-

reply is that no exception can be made. Mr.

lum seem to be about the only persons down South
who have a sincere objection to cheap labor.
SOME SYDNEY CHARACTER SKETCHES.
Lately it transpired that certain toothless old
gaffers in the institution made a few pence at
mending boots and sharpening razors, and that
some of the ancient crones eked out sundry cop-
pers at stocking-knitting. The proceeds were
spent in gaudy dissipation—principally tobacco
and tea. One member of the board, when he
heard of this, said “it was an appalling state of
affairs,” and his colleagues became practically
speechless with horror. When they partially re-
covered it was decided with emphasis that any he
or she patriarch in the asylum found doing any-
thing in future would be thrown out,’and have his
or her skull indignantly bounced on the pave-
ment. The asylum inmates are in future only to
sit and mumble at each other, with their one
remaining hair hanging down their backs, and all
boot-repairing is suspended under pain of death.

A Northern (N.S.W.) correspondent to
The Bulletin: —
Apropos your oft-repeated warnings re the danger of
j’-oung girls being allowed by their parents to attend
Chinese mission meetings, already within a radius of four
miles of a Northern town there are three half-bred Mon-
golian infants, the offspring of Sunday-school teachers or
their near relatives. An almond-eyed set of twins has
also caused trouble in the family of a one-time strong
supporter of Chinese missions. One alleged convert,
when asked by a local police-sergeant his opinion of the
mission business—" Parson tarn fool allee time ; hut welly
ni gell allee time, too."

A Southern divorce lawyer lately con-
ducted a suit for a plaintiff wife, got a decree nisi,
and recovered =£llB from funds left in the pro-
vince by the erring husband. He then brought
in his costs against the wife at £ll9, but he had
the decency not to ask for the balance due of £l.
And yet people are crying out for law reform !

There was trouble lately between a N.S. W.
shark and his victim re costs. Shark at last
offered to take £5 ss. and added that if the victim
was not satisfied the shark was willing to refer
the amount of his costs to any decent firm of
lawyers in Sydney. The reply:—
Herewith cheque for £5 ss. I note re your charges. My
fortunately limited experience has taught me that the
more decent a firm is the more they charge. For example
they work it out this way
Amount of law supplied £0 10 0
Decency ... 4 15 0
Total £5 5 0

The other day, at Sydney quarter sessions,
on behalf of an elderly man accused of having
assaulted a young girl, it was pleaded that having
formed the habit of drinking methylated spirit he
was at times unaccountable for his actions. The
N.S.W. Customs returns indicate that methylated
spirit is extensively drunk in Sydney. Some years
ago, when a Minister, B. R. Wise, was seeking
re-election for South Sydney, the duty on methy-
lated spirit was reduced to Is. per gallon, as a sop
to the furniture trade, strong in that quarter.
Result, a great increase in consumption, not
attributable to any cause except its use as a
beverage. It was at one time supposed that spirits
were rendered undrinkable by methylation, but
modern science has got over that little difficulty.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Nov. 10, 1896.
My Dear Myee—
Bowral and Moss Vale habitations are filling up
prematurely this season. In seeking mountain
retreats for the summery weather, the Very Nicest
never underrate the importance of having their
fresh milk from cows reared on pastures adjacent
to the Govt. herd. A loyal high-toned public
finds out first in what country district the hens
will cackle over the vice-regal breakfast egg, and
flit in that direction accordingly. Subsequently
the spot is declared to be the only possible summer
resort in the whole continent.
A Vic. mountain locality, which enjoyed a
boom of years because it was patronised by the
Lochs, slumped a little under the Hopetouns, who
preferred the western districts of the province,
but has now recovered its tone, and is declared by
many Sydney folk superior to anything this side,
and they are off to it for the summer. The
attractions of the place consist in driving up and
d >wn a steep hill-track in a turn-out smart enough
to make all the other residents restive, wearing all
your best clothes to neighboring afternoon teas,
and dressing for dinner. The only sport—for
women —is to play the precedence game for months
at a stretch ; that is, strive your very hardest to
get in the clique above you and utterly snub and
flout the ambitious stragglers trying to raise them-
selves to a higher bracket of the social Walhalla.
I lie men find their amusement in staving in town
and only running up to the Mount from Saturday
till Monday. Fish, fruit and vegetables are all
sent up from Melb. at famine rates, but every-
body on the Mount can afford to pay high prices,
and it is a blessed abode of calm, dull, respectable
“ gentility ” where the very cows have a gently
ruminative air of consciousness that the ultimate
end of their existence is whipped cream.
The Brasseys have just given a fashionable
fillip to Bright by rushing rapidly round the place
on bicycles a few weeks ago, and alternating that
with snow-shoeing. But tli ire is too much energy
required by tourists to make Bright a summer
residence. A tour in those parts means stiff
climbing and strong boots and serge, and a total
indifference about the straightnesj of your fringe.
The picture of the fashionable promenade in
Vienna, shown by the new cinematographe, tells
us that we needn’t hesitate about ordering new
and expensive blouses for fear the fashion will
have changed before they are made up. The
blouse and-skirt costume still reigns in that modish
city as it does in outlandish places, where it helps
along civilisation by enabling its wearers to look
smart with little trouble. A correspondent tells
me that in the Wild Far West the women turn
out every day in the main streets of the towns as
cool and composed as they would in G-eorge-street
on a winter’s day. The men, arrayed chiefly in
dust, swear at the heat and mop their faces; the
women trip out of their tents neat and trim in the
universal blouse and skirt. They may faint, but
never perspire.
One of Sydney’s prettiest girls, married some
time ago, when on a trip ’time, to a man with a
historical name, has returned for a short visit to
her native town. Like all young matrons, when
they want to enjoy themselves, she has left hubby
and the baby behind, and, disentangled from her
responsibilities, means to have a good time.
Sydney is becoming the haunt of the newly-
married from Vic. Quite lately, numerous annex-
have been made from among our next-door
neighbors’ sassiety damsels, who prefer to carry
on the matrimonial battle on the shores of the
beautiful harbor. Two bridal couples have arrived
from the South within the week—Mr. and Mrs.
Hinchcliffe, married with much pomp and cere-
mony among the tree-ferns and giant gums of
Lilydale a few weeks ago, who have taken up
their abode at Garden Island ; and Mr. and Mrs.
Phillips, who will settle here. Mrs. P. was Miss
Rosenthal, of Melb.
Sydney’s new Ladies’ Club is just opposite a
matrimonial agency. I merely draw your atten-
tion to this as a detached and lonely fact, for there
is absolutely no inference to be drawn. Marriage
rates in ladies’ clubs are much below par. There
is an abandon-hope-all-ye-who-enter-here sensation
lingering about the portals that never leaves one
for quite a while. The Melb. Austral Salon is a
shocking- example. There, most of the members
on the original roll remain as they were. The
male associates are so in altogether a Parliamen-
tary sense. A Salonite wedding with another
Salonite is as unthinkable as a fourth-dimension.
They haven’t the marrying bias like the Tween-
ways.
A preliminary meeting of Salon members was
held on Friday afternoon in the Club rooms; Mrs..
Burdekin and Mrs. Gadsden, the hostesses, shook
bands with as many early arrivals as they could
reach, and late comers had to be content with the
staircase. Not much scope is given for larger
meetings, when a crowd of 54—the four are men—
fill the rooms to overflowing. An entertainment
of music and recitals went on in the small drawing-
room, and afternoon-tea was administered in the
dining-room.
People are still marvelling at the sale of Dr.
Wadham’s furniture which took place last week,
and at the wonderful value placed by buyers upon
his household gods. The bargain-hunter was quite
out of it on that occasion. Some embroidered
Irish table-linen sheets brought three guineas a
pair. Of course, these fancy sheets are not for
sleeping on, any more than the highly-ornate
towels seen in some richly-gilt abodes are for
wiping damp hands on. They merely elaborately
conceal the working material below. Dr. Wad-
ham’s house had been most sumptuously furnished
as a private hospital. Authentic Persian carpets
of great age—all genuine Oriental floor-cloths
have a past—carved-oak fitments also a century or
two in arrears of present day, sticks and luxurious
hangings, all fetched top prices.
Affected people, I observe, seldom put sugar in
their tea. It is “ high church ”to drink the after-
noon cup unsweetened. Girls who are sweet-
toothed enough to nibble a sugar-lump on the quiet
will make a sacrifice to style and a wry face over
the afternoon ceremonial cup. Why doesn’t some
enquirer unearth the etiquette of tea-drinking ?
Most men pile sugar into the cup until it contains
a kind of syrup. Bushmen seldom take milk even
when they can get it. At a very swagger garden-
party in Sydney lately a distinguished globe-trot-
ting guest, around whom the shivoo had been
principally built up, was offered sugar, and para-
lysed the profferer by replying in icy tones, “No,
thanks, I nevah take sugah two days running.”
“Francillon,” at the Lyceum, is a comedy
setting forth the joy experienced by a “mahrried
mahn ” in Paris, and his wife’s discovery and
plotted revenge for the same. It follows that the
aforesaid wife must be young and lovely—an old
and ugly helpmate is only deserted in a farce —and
must wear captivating clothes. The “ mahrried
mahn ” who enjoys himself on the naughty con-
tinent must always be rich enough to do the thing
in style, dress his wife in seal-skin, employ pow-
dered menials, and call his aged parent “ Markee.”
Mrs. Potter’s Francillon, legally owned by Kyrle
Bellew, whose giddiness causes all the trouble, in
her costumes shows Worth at his worthiest. There
is Paris in every stitch of them.
That blue morning gown worn in the second
act is quite the best thing Mrs. P. has yet done on
the Australian stage ; it is of the faintest-hued
silk draped in a marvellous manner from between
the shoulders with canvas trimmed with inserted
bands of lace. The sleeves are of a brighter blue
with black spots, and a little band of brown fur
round the neck caught with a topaz gives snap to
the whole. Fortunately there is much less reeling
and writhing and fainting in coils in this part
than in others Mrs. B.P. has done, and she can
stand up straight and show her gowns throughout
the piece. She makes a distinct creation of each
separate black gown she wears. She conies a
good way out of her first-act frock and stays
outside it most of the act, but that is a Potter-
ism to which a gasping d.c. has become accus-
tomed, and it is a lovely frock with a front ar-
rangement like a Watteau pleat gone wrong. Her
cloak is very Frenchy, with a tight velvet bodice
underneath the full magpie folds. A figured black
and pink silk with black chiffon fixings reveals a
fetching pink silk and white lace underskirt, and
her skating coat of sealskin with large sable cape
suggests immense wealth. To see Mrs. Potter’s
I rancillon is a liberal education in clothes.
The Lyceum stage-dressing doesn’t reflect itself
in front. Dowdiness reigns around the d.c. most
depressingly, even on Saturday nights, which are
supposed to be sassiety functions. A globe-
trotting lady of title, with adherents all in niourn-
ing garb, filled one of the boxes last Saturday.
On Monday, with a sparse circle, all the boxes
were taken ; in one sat a well-known family group,
casting roses adoringly before the fair Cora.
The Bland Holt farewell on Monday night was
a great affair. “Joe” and Mrs. “Joe’’manage
to get themselves beloved wherever they go, and
they don’t need to pump up enthusiasm at “ Good-
byes.” When they depart a crammed theatre is
sorry, and says so. Parting flower-gifts were on a
quite gigantic scale, and Mrs. Holt had a sort of
informal reception in her dressing-room when the
many friends went round to say “ au revoir.”
I riends of the late Mrs. Carl Fischer want to
raise a memorial fund to her, to be devoted to the
education of her grandson, Carl Andrew. Her
library, including all the collection of musical
works, will be auctioned shortly.
An up-country visitor, strolling past the grand-
stand at Flemington, noticed a very pretty girl,
and, in his artless way, inquired of a couple of
Johnnies standing in front if they knew who that
swell girl was. The Johnnies were struck dumb
at the stranger’s cheek, and froze him with their
stony glare. Presently he learned that his divinity
was the newly-arrived sister of a nobleman, and
that the two Johnnies were A.D.C.’s doing watch-
dog over the Governor’s box.
All ills of mind, body, and estate can be legally
cured by women. She-preachers and she-doctors
abound, and “ proputty,” up till now man’s most
sacred possession, is, in America, litigated over
under feminine supervision. Mrs. Nellie Coke, a
Californian lawyer now visiting Sydney, numbers
among the most successful women practising at
the bar those who go in for civil and probate
business and office practice. Portia before the
Full Court is not such a triumph. Even her
upholder admits that she wants “ a few genera-
tions ” of training. A public patient enough to
be bored and have business obstructed during the
lady barrister’s evolutionary stages must console
itself by reflecting that it is suffering for the good
of posterity.
French is an attractive language to dress up a
par or a shop sign, but it presents many pitfalls.
The ambitious dressmaker, with window lettered
“ Miss Dash, Parissiene couturiere et costumiere, ”
gives herself away as much as the restaurant with
the legend affixed, “ Ici en parU francais ”
where they serve “ table de hote.” Local spelling
in the mother tongue is decidedly shaky too.
Two dentists advertise themselves recklessly as
“Messers” Smith and Jones. Also, a town
tradesman labels his wares as the “chepest,” and
“ monies ’’ are temptingly offered to borrowers on
several signs. After many years, the “Peir”
hotel is being brought up-to-date in its ortho-
graphy. Some of these guileless errors are pho-
netic, and follow the twang of local speech, and
some are reminiscent of “ the ole congvick d’ys,”
as Sydneyites call them.
They were talking nationalities in a drawing-
room recently, and loud above the hum of conver-
sation rang the voice of an intensely superior
sassiety dame, who keeps an 18-year-old daughter
in short kilts to make herself juvenile, “ Oh, deah
no ; Ai’m not a colonial. Ai’m English to the tips
of my fingahs.” The company paused, visibly im-
pressed, when the silence was broken by the quiet
voice of an old lady seated in a far corner : “Yes,
my dear, I can prove that. I remember your poor
father and mother arriving 45 years ago, and you
were a big child then.”
The harmless necessary “ souvenir ” is super-
seding the nearly played-out wedding-present as
a form of blackmail. It is worked thus : Mrs. A.
sends round a circular letter to all her acquaint-
ances, urging them to contribute towards a small
keepsake for “ dear Mrs. 8.,” who is leaving for a
trip ’Ome. To find a sufficiently complacent Mrs.
A., the souvenir-receiver must previously have
shown some practical civility to her social en-
dorser. Intended victims have shown signs of
jibbing at the latest testimonial-raising, and some
have gracefully wriggled out of adding their mite
to the heap. But the recipient knows not of this,
and urges her backers to beg laggard male friends
to contribute, as they are only “ waiting to be
asked.”
A craving for culture has lately been developed
among some Sydney girls. They meet .on Monday
afternoons to drink tea and have facts fired into
them concerning Rossetti, W. Morris, and other
soulful poets, whose poems they recite and read,
after listening to a lecture on the same. The lec-
turess, a grad, of Sydney University, is a daugh-
ter of the late Alex. Britton, and niece of
“Timotheus” Willoughby.
The women suffragists are holding meetings in
suburban town-halls, and are excited and jubilant
about the almost certain success of the “ Great
Principle.” When they get it, as they have already
in S.A. and M.L., it won’t be on account of any
enlightening eloquence on the part of fluent plat-
form women who have devoted their lives to the
“ Cause,” but because it may happen to suit the
political cards of some party wishing to use the
woman’s vote for its own purpose. The tyrant
man gets ahead every time. Moving spirits bring
fervor to bear on the glorious enfranchisement of
the down-trodden sex, and thrill with triumph as
they mop their heated faces after a fervid appeal
to the slave of centuries to arise and demand her
rights. She might keep on demanding if it did
not suit some mere man in the back-ground to
grant it her. There’s nothing wrong with woman
suffrage as a principle, but only listen to the
speeches of the men advocating it to find out how
little they care for that principle ! The cleverest
man can be made a fool of- by the silliest woman,
but it takes merely an ordinary man to twist the
cleverest woman round his finger.
Three songs by Aug. W. Juncker have been
published by Wicken and Co., of London ; two,
“All in All ” and “Love’s Last Appeal,” were
previously published locally. “ Galilee,” the new
one, is a song of the popular sentimentally-
“ sacred ” variety like the little polka that became
the choir-boy, with fluttering angel’s wings and
organ effects in the accompaniment and a sacred
calm pervading the last verse. It may safely be
recommended to the most serious family for Sun-
day afternoons. “ Nazareth ” has much to answer
for. The map of Palestine is searched for geo-
graphical names calculated to give a religious thrill
to song-titles. Composers will get to Kadesh
Barnea and Ramoth Gilead before the demand
gives out.
Writes my Melb. correspondent:—
“ Cup gaieties over, social shivoos are simmer-
ing away in a series of ‘at homes ’ and garden-
parties. The particular topic of the shining hour
has been Mrs. Silas Harding’s g.p., to which
everybody and anybody was invited. Sassiety
came in force to smile upon the rich man’s relict
and see how the boom-time residence of Matthew
Davies looked under new management. Envious
critics couldn’t reasonably object to the splendor
of the decorations and upholstering, which proved
to be in perfect harmony with the refreshment
scheme. More than one guest went away full of
unspeakable gratitude for the hostess’s champagne.
“ Zelman £ie younger—as H. J. King, the auto-
crat of Melb. Liedertafel, styles him—has been
chaffed unmercifully about his bicycle mishap.
While still badly in need of further rehearsal with
that obstreperous steed the wild musician essayed
a trip through town, when the bike, becoming un-
manageable, knocked a man down and rode over
him. The youngster’s visit to the poliee-court
resulted in a merciful sentence of five shillings and
costs.
“Things are looking up with tenor Newbury
and co. After a prosperous season in Tassy came
a good engagement in Adelaide, and they are
booked to sing presently with the Melb. Phil-

“ His Ex. created a mild sensation, the other
day, by driving down Collins-street with his
typical British flunkeys disguised in white linen
and pith head-gear. _ Lord B. sat hidden under a
helmet similar to his coachman’s, but Lady B.
spoiled the otherwise cool effect of the ensemble
by shading Helen de Vere, the offspring, on her
knee with a brilliant red umbrella. Shaftesbury,
doubled up on the little front seat, was visibly
squirming at the attention the turn-out attracted.
“ A fashionable Melb. modiste is the first lady
member of the Victorian Racing Club. It was
submitted by her proposer that she was specially
entitled to the privilege, as her skill and talent,
embodied in the taste and elegance of the toilettes
emanating from her firm, and displayed on the
Lawn, had, for years past, materially contributed
to the success of the various race-meetings by ren-
dering them especially attractive to the ladies,
who were, after all, the main support of these
social gatherings. The claim was at once cordially
recognised, and the first lady candidate unani-
mously elected amid great applause.
“ A very lavish entertainment was given lately
by a much-gilt lady. Some hundreds of invita
tions were issued, but the guests much out-
numbered those invited, for with each card the
hostess sent a note, begging the invited one to
bring as many of her own personal friends with
her as she could induce to come. The result was
an enormous gathering and a very sumptuous
though more than half the people didn’t
know their hostess by sight. By this stroke, the
astute lady fancies she has gained a much-desired
result. The ‘ best ’ people, she thinks, must call
cm her now after having enjoyed her hospitality,
®‘ le little knows the ‘ best ’ people,
“ Social functions have little charm for Attorney-
General Isaacs. While his wife, the smartest of
Melb. Jewesses, frisks at Government House balls
and fashionable affairs of all sorts, Mr. Isaacs
recreates by reading law-books in the Parlia-
mentfiry Library. Premier Turner, on the othei
hand, has lately shown a fondness for basking in
social smiles, and expands in his lighter moods
m to a pleasant gossip and a jocular conversa-
tionalist. lhe old brown suit has been placed on
dle retired list, and the broad bosom of plain
George is more often covered by an expanse of
white lawn. There will (despite Mr. Reid) be one
niore Sir George on the continent if this deca-
oence continues.
“ Talking of new women, the tall and toney
‘ Madame ’ who practises face massage in the
Block arcade is surprised at the number of girls

expected to catch on with the fresh and frivolous
section of society. But it seems that frivolity in a
Melbourne girl is quite consistent with secret
thought for the morrow when the age marks would

The Late “Sappho Smith”: A Memory.
The portrait on page 10 of this issue represents
Miss Alexina M. Wildman, known to all Bulle-
tin readers under her pen-name of “Sappho
Smith,” whose untimely death last Sunday morn-
ing will be regretted by everyone who is acquainted
with her writings. Miss Wildman’s whole liter-
ary career was associated with this paper, and her
connection with it covers the best part ot The
Bulletin’s history. She made her first appear-
ance in this office as a bright, audacious school-
girl with original ideas and strong ambitions, and
she was a distinct literary success from
the very beginning of her career. For a
little over ten years Miss Wildman was
a regular member of The Bulletin staff;
and, even after this lengthy period of hard work,
she closed her life at the early age of 28 years.
The letter signed “ Sappho Smith ” was probably
the most widely-read portion of this paper, and it
fully deserved all the popularity it achieved. It
demonstrated so fully the deceased lady’s abilities
that it would be superfluous to say anything
further of her capacity as a journalist. Miss
Wildman’s fatal illness had its first beginnings
early in 1894, but until four months ago she per-
sistently remained at her post, and maintained her
brightness and energy unimpaired. At last she
was induced to take a holiday, and she returned
from a visit to Queensland only to die. Her last
contribution appeared in the issue of Aug. 22. Miss
Wildman used to say that it was her desire to pass
away on a Sunday, and she breathed her last very
peacefully just five minutes after midnight last
Sunday morning. Her remains were laid in
Waverley cemetery close beside the sea, at the
quietest end of that interminable city of the dead.
The Bulletin deeply regrets her as a brilliant
writer, a good comrade, and a lady who was loved
and esteemed by all who knew her well; and is
sure that its readers all the world over will share
in its regrets.

The story goes in Sydney that neither Mr.
Edmund Barton nor Mr. R. E. O’Connor is willing
to accept the vacant Supreme Court Judgeship—
which has been declined by Mr. C. B. Stephen
mainly on the ground that he has a brother on the
Bench. At time of writing, the question who
would succeed Mr. Justice Innes was still a matter
of speculation.

In a recent issue of a Southern religious
weekly, “ Vedette,” the writer of the Argus
“ Deeds that Won the Empire.” was stated to be

The will of Baron Von Mueller is simplicity

The Baron devotes the interest on <£loo to deco-

Leith Napier, the imported doctor so much
discussed in Adelaide just now, is, like his chief
supporter, Premier Kingston, a big, burly man,
standing over 6ft., and looks capable of settling
the hospital difficulty in one round, were it pos-
sible to settle it by fisticuffs.
The chief constituent-trouble which one
N.S.W. Minister of the Crown at present staggers

his name to some newly-created township or some
newly-discovered river.
Dr. Thornton, Bishop of Ballarat, has,
according to the London correspondent of the

The Bulletin deeply regrets to hear that
the malady by which Mr. J. P. Garvan, of the

malignant disease of the stomach.
Miss Portia Geach, the 16-year-old Prahran

Caldwell, M.P. (S.A.), recently asserted in
S.A. Assembly that Moses married a colored

“ Well, anyway,” said the guileless Caldwell, “we

King O’Malley, M.L.A., owes it to hiny

at present.
The N.S. Wales M.P. who, on a recent Sun-

Sunday-eiosing law), went and drank at 11 Sydney
public-houses, is now known as the “ illegitimate

Prom mail letters it appears that “ Charlie

His remains were interred in Pere la Chaise on the

£. £. Smith advertises the 37th year of his

practice in Victoria. The corky little man, who
is now within three years of seventy, ascribes his
general juvenility and clear skin to the habit of
taking a small dose of sulphur in water every

considerations, that <£.=£. should be fond of sul-

The West Austra-

a cablegram, put the re-
mark of Gladstone on
hearing of the demise of
the Archbishop of Can-
terbury—“ He died like

of the Archbishop him-
self. Humor is evidently
a minimum quantity in
Westralia, for next Sun-
day Canon Louch, of
Geraldton, preached a
memorial sermon in which
he commented on the ap-
propriateness of the Arch-
bishop’s dying words.
Old Baron Von Muel-
ler delighted to relate
how, when director of
Melb. Botanical Gardens,
he entered into conversa-
tion with an utter stranger
who was contemplating
the grounds from an
eminence. The stranger
was voluble and rattled
off botany by the yard,
never pausing long enough
to allow the director to
correct his many errors.
At last he summed up
the scene before him :
“Yes, ’m, ’m yes; very
fair gardens. They’d be
decent gardens if it wasn’t
for that blanky old fool,
Von Mueller.” “ Mine
vriendt,” said the Baron,
more in pity than in anger,
“lam dat blangy old vool.”
N. : “Why did Verdon take such a
prejudice against his knightage ? The obituary
notifications stripping him of all title and lettering
must have been conformable to his will. His
travelling trunks, sold at last week’s auction, bore
the tickets of his recent European trip, all plain
‘ G. F. Verdon.’ ”
Gaoler M‘Kinley, of Wellington (N.S. W.),
who died suddenly the other day, was one of the
three police officers who engaged in a hand-to-
hand encounter with Angel and Thurston, bush-
rangers, at Belinfante Bridge, near Adelong, when
storekeeper Stewart was murdered and the two
outlaws shot down.
Physiology Professor M‘Coy, of Melb. Uni-
versity, has been granted a year's leave on half-
pay, J 2575. Had the University had legal power
to award a pension, the Professor would have re-
tired thereon two years back. The present half-
pay is by a legal fiction a yearly allowance, which
is really a pension save only in name. The work
of the physiology department will be carried on by
a lecturer at <£soo a year, with tacit right to the
reversion of the chair. It is an open secret that
the lectureship will, if he applies, be given to
young Dr. C. J. Martin, of Sydney. Dr. Martin
is a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Medicine,
of London University, and a M.R.C.S. For a
considerable time he was demonstrator and lec-
turer on physiology at King’s College, London,
under the celebrated Professor Halliburton (whom
he assisted in his textbook of chemical physiology
and pathology), and he now occupies a similar
post in Sydney University under Prof. Anderson
Stuart. Dr. Martin’s researches on blood coagu-
lation, on the action of black and tiger snake
venom on the blood, and on the poison-glands of
the platypus, have gained him high distinction in
the scientific world.
Barrister Purves, who forgot the Lord’s
Prayer, takes the same gallery as Col. Burnham,
one of the United States successful lawyers, when
things religious come up. “You don’t know what
Christmas celebrates ? ” cried Burnham to a
witness, whose sanity he desired to impeach,
“ The jury can judge what head a man has who
doesn’t know what Christmas celebrates ! ” Then,
turning on the witness again, “ Don’t you know,
sir, that Christmas celebrates the crucifixion of
the Redeemer ? ” But the slip lost Burnham the
case.

Gas. Sleight, of Melbourne, who was not
less an identity than an undertaker, has taken his
last ride behind four black horses. Everybody
knew flus., and all persons of importance—except-
ing the R.C. circle—took it for granted that their
funeral arrangements would be carried out by the
Collins-street coffin-maker. His business during
boom-time became so large and lucrative that a
scheme for converting it into a limited co. was
about to be realised when depression set in, and
the prospectus, if The Bull-tin remembers
rightly, was withdrawn. One way and another

the bursting of the boom affected Augustus con-
siderably, but he preserved a cheerful countenance
and wore his black doth bell-topper jauntily to
the end. A good-hearted undertaker, was Gus.
Sleight. If his customers proved to be stiff in
both senses of the term, he didn’t press for the
bill, and many a time he must have lent a “fiver ”
to a sick acquaintance previous to burying him
gratis. Not a vain - glorious man, either. The
pomp and vanity of a fashionable interment didn’t
dazzle him, who had stage-managed so many im-
posing processions. Gus. might have buried him-
self in gorgeous style at the smallest possible cost
price, instead of which his funeral was strictly
private “in accordance with the wishes of
deceased.”
Dear Bulletin, —l knew the Edward
Grennan, now of Victoria, who has just (after 42
years !) received a pension for having been one of
the Balaclava six hundred ; and, putting aside the
fact thsft without cast-iron proof the War Office
wouldn't have “ parted,” the Hibernian warrior’s
account of that splendid piece of insanity was eon-
vincingly straightforward and graphic. “ Divil a
thing I remimber about it afther the ‘Charge’
till I finds meself slashin’ away at the Rooshaa
gunners ; an’ how I got back I know no more’n

“Wally” Kerr, a 26-year-old
Sydney native, whose defeats at Mel-
bourne on Saturday came as a suf*
prise, is one of the smallest and
most remarkable of Australian cyo-
lists; he stands sft. sin., and, stripped,
weighs Bst. 91b. He is a game and
clever racer, paced or unpaced ; he is a
most consistent performer, and always
does better in the actual race than in
a trial, partly because he has the pluck
and mostly because he is not a cash-
amateur. He recently went for the
paced Aus. records for quarter-mile to
one mile. He flew the quarter through
in 26 4-sseo., as against Englishman
Harris’s 27 3-ssee. and Don Walker’s
27 ljssec.; he scorched the half-mile 08
in 54sec. dead—Jack Parsons’ record;
and he threw the whole mile behind
in lmin. 57sec. ; Parsons’ Australian
best is lmin. 58 3-ssec. Kerr’s best mi-
paced mile against time was 2min.
17sec. ; the difference, 20sec., between
this and the paced mile is the exact
difference which pacing used to
make to Zimmerman. Like most
successful cyclists, Kerr began in an-
other line of athletics ; he rowed con-
stantly from the age of 13 to 18. He
began cycling at 19, and, after seven
weeks’ learning, he rode second-last in
a novice race. Since then he has raced
on all sorts of bikes, on all sorts of roads
and tracks, against all sorts of com-
petitors ; he had but one serious fall;
it broke his nose. He has gained some
160 trophies, including many bracelets ;
and no one girl has more than one of
them. He has toured N.S. W., Vic., M. L.
and Tas. He was the first man to cyole
across IS .S. W. Blue Mountains. He thinks Christ-
church, M.L., with its beautiful roads, a cyclist’s
paradise ; but for a real comprehensive tour Tas.
comes first with its scenery, roads, fruit—and
girls. Kerr goes to England next March to race
against the English amateurs, and he hopes to do
well there, since he has always found a cold climate
suit him better than a hot one ; he has always
raced better in his native winter than in summer.
In England, too, he will have the time and oppor-
tunity to train systematically. Training, so far,
he has believed in one ride daily, one walk, one
quarter hour’s dumb-bell exercise, one short swim,
one sun-bath on a beach ; three square meals.

The resurrection of lunatic Creswell re-
calls the fact that editor Brentnall, of Brisbane
Telegraph, in his old Wesleyan days, married
the Tichborne Claimant, according to that vera-

called himself Castro, and naively explained that
he turned Wesleyan for the occasion, as he was
thereby enabled to lie about his real name.
Apropos the lamented death in England,
on 2nd Oct. last, of Dr. S. M. Caffyn, whose
graceful sympathetic stories have charmed many
a Bulletin reader, “ G.G.M’C.” sends the fol-
lowing :
IN MEMORLAM,
STEPHEN MANNINGTON CAFFYN,
OBT. 2nd OCT., 1896.
The star in the sea finds a sister,
The swan crowns her mate in the lake,
And the wave where the pale moon has kissed her
Is silver once more for her sake ;
But the willow that waves o’er the water
That mirrors her image in vain
Sighs in accents Despair must have taught her—
Ah 1 never again !
Whom the Gods love, they all die too early,
We miss their glad faces too soon
From our world in its mad hurly-burly,
At morn and at night and at noon.
How we love them (of Life avaricious) !
How we clasp them in death to our hearts !
While the crowd and.canaille meretricious
Probe the wound till it rankles and smarts.
He has passed in the prime of his power,
He has sped in the dawn of his day ;
In the time when the sun-gazing ftow’r
Of his genius tower’d high o’er the clay,
Now silenced his laughter for ever ;
All his sallies and sweetness are past,
His like, it returns to us never—
To think that that smile was the last 1
We loved him and loved altogether,
Physician, Philosopher, Friend,
Through the fairest and stormiest weather
With never a thought of the end.
Yet he dies not: his story survives him ;
He lives in the tales he has told
With a glamor all golden around him ;
He is ours ! and he never grows old.
Yet, waft breezes! o’er sea these bright flowers,
All glad with the gold of our sun,
And lay them ’mid tears from soft showers
On the mound where the grass has begun ;
Lay them there o’er his breast in Old England
For me and for us and for mine,
Where fond children and wife yet lament him
“ Twixt Shadow and Shine.”


"NONE SO BLIND,” ETC.
“Already the great revival of trade which has followed the U.S. Presidential
campaign has been claimed in several places as a proof of how a protectionist victory
affects the country. To a political party which saw in the return of Major M'Kinley a
protectionist triumph it should be easy enough to think thus. The simple truth is that
the immense increase of activity in commercial circles which is now evident has nothing
whatever to do with any fiscal change that may result from the late election.”

writes a letter to Warner’s Safe Cure Co., Mel-
bourne.
“Gentlemen: For two years I suffered from
indigestion, and various medicines and doctors
could give me no relief. My appetite fell away,
and I dreaded taking a meal. I lost strength and
energy, passed sleepless nights, and was compelled
to resort to opiates and stimulants in order to
fulfil my daily duties. Life contained no enjoy-
ment for me. Then one day, about a year ago,
Warner’s Safe Cure was recommended by a friend
as a certain cure. I had little hope, so many
medicines having failed, but decided to give it a
trial. After taking one bottle a change in my
health for the better became apparent. I con-
tinued taking this health-giving preparation for
about a month, then the world changed for me.
The sun shone brighter. Sleeplessness vanished,
and life was a torrid zone once more. You have
my permission to make use of this, as I consider
by recommending this medicine that I am confer-
ring a boon, not on its proprietors, but upon suf-
fering humanity.”

Required the exact temperature of the hot
words required to make the average legislator
blush. Can it be that certain politicians are
prawns found on the sands of corruption, which
never redden until they’re boiled ?
S.M. Herald berates members of Parlia-
ment for throwing out the Local Option Bill on
legitimate points of order, but condones, by its
silence, the petty trick whereby the Capital
Punishment Abolition Bill was shelved.
Premier Reid states that next session ‘ ‘ very
pointed action ” will be taken re the N.S.W.
Council’s rejection of the Referendum scheme.
G.R. will sharpen the point during the recess, and
jab it into the Upper House about next May.
A N.S.W. District Court Judge asserts
that Public-schools breed criminals, immorality,
&c. Let Coghlan answer : —Prom ’6l to 95 the
population has more than trebled itself, while the
number of school children has increased 6f, times.
At the same time crime has only increased by one-
fourth, while the rate of committals shows a posi-
tive decrease.
Tot homines in a small way. In N.S.W.
Council ©n the Colored Races Restriction Bill,
L. F. Heydon : “ The object of the Bill is states-
manlike, most proper in itself, and most necessary
at the present time.” Dangar (the immediately
aext speaker) : “ The Bill is cowardly, selfish, and
inexpedient, and one introduced under the de-
spicable influence of fear.”
In the General Federal Assembly, fore-
casted by a select committee of N.S.W. Leg.
Council in 1857, N.S. Wales, Victoria, S. Aus-
tralia and Tasmania were alone represented.
Queensland did not then exist, and W.A. was a
Crown colony. Federalists to-day should be
happy to start with the old name-basis.
The beginning of the trouble. Recently
arrived in Aus. waters the Yamashiro Maru, the
first vessel of a powerful Japanese steamship co.,
with a crew of five European officers and 87 Jap.
sailors. The apartments are scrupulously clean
and the cabins commodious, while the vessel
carries 14 guns, and oan, in 20 minutes, be con -
verted into a veritable sea-hornet.
Bananaland has a Public Service Act, de-
signed to eliminate political influence from the
Civil Service. In the new Bill before the Assembly
a clause actually exists allowing the Minister to
over-ride the Public Service Board’s decisions !
Motto for the civil service all over Australia :
“ Beware of using outside influence, unless it be
powerful enough to get what you want.”
M‘Kinley, the U.S. President'
elect is also a Bimetallist, but not of
the Bryan variety. MMvinley believes
in an arrangement whereby all the
civilised nations will make silver and
gold equally legal tender to an un-
limited extent, the fixed relative value
being the same everywhere. The Bryan
party proposes that the U.S. should
make silver a legal tender without
waiting for other nations to move in
the matter, which would mean that the
States would have to buy about all the
silver on earth that was not otherwise
required, and wouldn’t be able to sell
it again. The M‘Kinley idea of Bi-
metallism is feasible enough; if all
nations came to an agreement they
could make anything legal tender. The
Bryan variety looks—in view of the
fact that the U.S. Treasury is already
crammed with silver which won’t cir-
culate —like utter insanity.
Among the several hundred or
thousand or billion candidates who are
now raging in Maoriland there isn’t one,
so far as The Bulletin can find out,
who doesn’t profess to believe in the
anti-borrowing theory. Also, there
doesn’t seem to be one who is prepared
to advocate the only policy that can
prevent borrowing, which is to invent
some new sources of revenue, by taxa-
tion or otherwise, which will yield (say)
.£500,000 a year ;to let the proceeds be
paid direct into a Public Works Fund
so that the Treasurer can’t absorb them
into revenue ; and to give up profess-
ing to depend on the sad, precarious
surplus. The surplus, as a means for
the construction of new railways and
roads and bridges and harbours, isn’t
worth 2jd as a general thing.
Absurdly illogical for Premier Reid to
ukase that “sweater” manufacturers shall not
tender for Government contracts, when his own
Freetrade policy sucks in “ sweater ” goods by the
thousand. Can’t he ukase something against the
importer whose “sweater” imports compel the
manufacturer to “ sweat ” ?
THE MODESTY OF PURITY.
JOHNNIE : “ Why do nearly all the Social Purity
people wear specs.?”
CISSIE : “I don't know."
JOHNNIE : “ 'Cause they're ashamed to look with
the naked eye! See!!"
“ To say the Turk must be rooted out is
one of those horrible religious cries that flooded
France with the blood of the Huguenots.”—Fort-
nightly Review.
The Yarra-bank orators anticipated the
“Trafalgar” meeting at Melb. Town Hall by
passing a resolution that the Democracy of Vic-
toria, being opposed to all jingoism, “tenders the
right hand of fellowship to the French Consul,
and through him to President Faure, with a mes-
sage of most friendly feeling towards our brethren,
the people of France.” This was proposed by
the irrepressible Fleming, seconded by a parson,
and carried unanimously by about 1000 furious
republicans. It was a grimy hand of fellowship
that they held out to President Faure, and it
hadn’t done much hard work lately, but it was
quite as honest as the average paw that applauded
Brassey and his himperial offspring next night.
Yic. Leg. Councillor Wallace (probably
worth ,£500,000) is another patriot who quotes his
own case as an overwhelming argument against
early closing. He says that if he—Wallace-had
never been compelled to work more than eight
hours a day he would not now be a member of the
’Ouse. The Bulletin rise? herewith to deplore
the fact that there was no State legislation for
Wallace in his younger days.
IN A COUNTRY SALEYARD.
PATRICK : “ What is the horse's breeding?"
AUCTIONEER: “He is by Clan M‘Donald out
of”
PATRICK : “ Sir s, I knew he was Scotch before
I looked second time at him. I'll give
you two-and-elevenpence for the poor
baste.”
A Northern correspondent to The Bul-
letin :
Nelson’s and Tozer’s protest about so tew Chinese com-
ing into Queensland is all rot, as they come in all along
this river (Duinaresq) without let or hindrance, and so
confident are they that there is no objection that they
enquire boldly on the W.S.W. side where to cross over.
They cross openly in daylight at Texas, where there are
police stationed, but the officers evidently have the
official tip to be blind. And why? Well, people get
from H to % of the tobacco crops grown by the Chow.
This year most sold from 6d. to 7d. per lb. A good crop
may go from 1500 to 20001 b. per aore, which means a nice
thing for the lazy whites who employ them. Some people
here who only pay Id. per acre per annum to Govt, for
land, make as much as £lO per acre out of Chows.
One man, who can neither read nor write, made about
£lOOO last season. Advance Australia !
The one genuine brick which the Maoriland
Tory party can throw at the Seddon Government
is that it is a borrowing Minis-
try with an anti-borrowing
policy. There have been
many anti-borrowing Min-
istries inAustralasia, but
they all borrow. The
live things that the
“kawl in ist ” is
solid about is that
this is the richest
country in the world,
that it has more
wealth per head of
population than any
other place on earth,
that its resources are
“ boundless,” that it
can't stand enough
taxation to pay its
own current ex-
penses, and that, if it
doesn’t keep borrow-
ing from poorer coun-
tries abroad, it will
go bung and be para-
lysed, and the Lord
only knows what will
become of it.
It is suggested that
Chief-Justice Griffith’s
visit to New Guinea has
something to do with Q.
colored labor difficulty. Three
or four years ago Griffith made a
similar visit, and discussed with Ad-
ministrator Macgregor the feasibility of
using Papuan instead of Kanaka labor on Q.
plantations. But Mac. objected. This time
Griffith is said to have in view a scheme for the
transfer of the plantations themselves to Papua.
It is an audacious idea, but could only apply to an
extension of the sugar industry, since it would pay
none of the Q. planters at present making a profit to
shift, and Boodlewraith will stick by its bank,
whose mortgagees the planters are. Then what
would be the attitude of white Australia to a
white-and-black New Guinea ?
Apparently the awful revelations by Ander-
son “ agin ” Slattery—-the Dibbs Govt.’s Minister
of Mines —re the drunks and incapables and dis-
orderly ignoramuses said to have been appointed
to civil-service billets, have fallen through. At
least, a select committee, more or less superin-
tended by Slattery’s ex-colleague Lyne, reports, in
effect, that Anderson now says he was “ misunder-
stood,” and that he has nothing against Slattery.
This lame conclusion of the most picturesque story
ever told about the N.S.W. Public .Service is very
unsatisfactory. If Slattery’s appointees were not
as drunk as originally supposed, how drunk were
they, or were they not drunk at all ? And if they
weren’t drunk at all, who was drunk ? Consider-
ing what Anderson said about Slattery, the com-
mittee can’t well whitewash Slattery without say-
ing something very nasty indeed about Anderson.
And, if it doesn’t, people will be apt to think that
it lets Anderson down easily for fear that he should
retaliate by saying something more about Slattery.
Duncan Gillies, it is alleged, will be an-
other candidate for the Yic. Speakership. Dear
old. cordial Duncan, with the shiny countenance,
which always looks as if it had just been washed
with brown soap at the kitchen sink, would
probably make a good enough Speaker in his way.
He never quarrels, but affably throws his own
natural grease on the troubled waters, and no man
can back-down more genially than Duncan.
Gov. Jerry Smith
of Westralia has no-
ticed that the Aus-
tralian railways vary
greatly in gauge, and
makes the brilliant
remark that it would
be a good thing to
have them all one
standard, but that
the alteration (her i
Gov. Smith is especi-
ally brilliant) would
cost some money.
E vidently the British
connection is of some
value after all, when
it lands hunks of in-
formation like this
upon our shores. If
Gov. Smith hadn’t
mentioned them, the
above facts might
never have come to
light at all.
The loudest cry
from the Maoriland
Tory party is against
the Seddon Govern-
ment’s “experimen-
tal legislation.” Yet
every good thing that
was ever done was
experimental at first;
also every bad thing.
If anything is to be
done somebody must
experiment with it;
we can’t all be slav-
ish copyists, for then
there would be no
one to copy. The
party which speaks
as if experimental
legislation is neces-
sarily a curse merely
because it is experi-
mental, is a dreary,
wooden -h ead ed
thing.
Of the 19 Labor Ms.L.A. in the Q. As-
sembly only one sports a “hard-hitter”; the
others wear the homely soft felt or cabbage-tree,
and by a coincidence the one mentioned has
yearnings for the loaves and fishes to be obtained
on the right of the Speaker.
Premier Turner is reckoned the quickest
and clearest speaker in Vic. Parliament. He is
reputed to have got through his speech on the
State Bank Bill at the rate of 100 words a minute,
yet he was clear and distinct, and never lost h-is
way once among great masses of intricate figures
and details. Deakin is a good second as a quick,
business-like orator. It isn’t necessarily the man
who has a lot to say who occupies the time of Par-
liament, provided he knows his subject and is
dear and rapid ; the man who mumbles slowly
along and says “er ” and “ahem ” may look con-
cise in Hansard, but he fills in a dreadful lot of
time.
A Bulletin correspondent :
Instead of bringing in a Bill to extend time for pay-
ment of Land-tax, why could not Treas. Reid have intro-
duced one enforcing payment of land-tax on amount re-
turned by landholders within 30 days from passing of Act?
The difference between Commissioners’ valuation and
owners’ could then be adjusted satisfactorily and the
balance due to Govt, paid on the court’s decision being
pronounced. The Govt, could hold a prior right to land
for balance of taxation in a similar manner to muni-
cipalities. Should the owner not pay promptly on
court’s decision, the Govt, to summarily sell land for
balance of taxation due. If the land did not bring balance
of taxation at auction it would clearly prove that the
Commissioners and court had much over-valued it.
There would not be one such case in 1000, as the
Govt, could take the right to bid, and thus prevent any
ring among owners being formed. I suppose this would
afford too satisfactory a solution, of the difficulty for
Reid. The time he has allowed for hearing appeals will
not suffice for half of them. —Country Cousin.

A remarkable Refrigerator for keeping
butter, meat, and milk cool during the warm
weather is on sale at Messrs. Brandt Bros.’, 236
Pitt-street, Sydney. It is a metal cylindrical
chamber ; water is placed in the bottom, which
requires replenishing once or twice a week; by
capillary attraction it is drawn up so that the air
can play on it, which makes it self-acting, causing
the water to chill making the interior quite
cold. The hotter the weather the colder it gets,
as the evaporation is greater.*
The Eye-sight, measure sent per post by
the inventors, Messrs. Greenfield and Barraclough,

necessary for obtaining proper spectacles. The
subtler forms of sight-defect cannot, of course, be
measured by the instrument, but it is thoroughly
effective for the more usual forms of eye affection
such as long sight, short sight, old sight. Full
particulars from Messrs. Greenfield and Barra-
clough. *
HOW TO PREVENT PREMATURE
death from disease.—Use Eno’s “Eruit Salt.”
It ought to be kept'in every bedroom in readiness
for any emergency ; without such a simple precau-
tion the jeopardy of life is immensely increased.
The action of the “Eruit Salt” is entirely in
accordance with nature, its use is imperatively
necessary to the enjoyment of perfect health, and
the prolongation of life (you cannot overstate its
value), and some day it will be acknowledged by
the whole world to be the greatest blessing
bestowed upon man for the prevention of all
disastrous diseases. Sold by all chemists and
stores.*

In Vic. Leg. Council, last week, J. C.
Campbell gave his little reason for objecting to
early-closing legislation and all stuffanonsense of
that sort. • He told his brother fatmen that when
he was managing a rag-shop for the almighty Sar-
good he used to work from 4 a.m. until midnight,
and it did him no harm. That’s where Campbell
falls into pitiable error. It did him a lot of harm
by helping to make him the sort of man he is to-
day. The down-trodden counter-jumper, as soon
as he “rises to a position,” is the most intolerant
of mortals.
Mr. John Shaw, of Parramatta, to The
Bulle.iv : —“Edward Poynter, new President of
the British Royal Academy, had a. Frenchwoman
for mother. An uncle of his was the sculptor De
Triqueti (one of Louis Philippe’s barons). His
father, Ambrose Poynter, - an architect of note,
who drew exquisitely in water-colors, was a mas-
ter of ‘ perspective,’hence the present Poynter's
force in that line. E.P. was at Lee’s school of
drawing, London, for a short time as a boy (after
leaving Westminster). His father’s sight failed
about ’5B, and the family went to live at Dussel-
dorf, where the future President studied hard.
Paris, however, was where he ‘ graduated ’ as
Master of Art. He and I were chums as boys in
holiday times, which he often spent at my father’s
place in Kent. He was specially smart at fire-
work-making, and together we turned out won-
derful rockets and Roman candles, one of which
exploded in his hands and went near to ruining
his eyesight.”
San Francisco Chronicle says of Maxine
Elliott’s petition for divorce from her husband,
George A. M'Dermott: “ The plaintiff s attorneys
have reason to believe that the suit will not be
contested. Mr. M‘Dermott has found another
who pleases his eye, and the divorce will be mutu-
ally agreeable.” Is the man mad .
Dr. Grace Clara Stone, who headed the
poll against all-comers for the Prahran (Vic.)
School Board of Advice on Nov. 12, graduated
Bachelor of Medicine and of Surgery at Melb.
University in ’92. She is the middle member of
a sisterly trio of practising doctors.
The Borneo Government turns the philately
craze to account by issuing a new and attractive
postage-stamp design every year. The stamps
that pass through the Borneo post on envelopes
represent only a very small percentage of the num-
ber sold to dealers. And so with other small
states, whose pretty stamps are made principally
to be looked at, not for practical use.
The claim of N.S.W. solicitors to a share
of the judicial appointments—both District and
Supreme Court —is backed by lots of common-
sense, and now that a judge’s order can turn a
solicitor into a barrister, even legal etiquette can
suggest no difficulty. Chief Justice Martin filled
the office of Attorney-General while a solicitor,
and, had he gone straight from that office to the
Bench, it might have been all the better for the
administration of law. Solicitors who have been
appointed judges in other parts of Australia have
left records quite equal to those of barrister-
judges.
Frank Hann, a well-known Northern iden-
tity, reports that while crossing the Northern
Territory he shot, for food, a clean-skin on a run
supposed to be perfectly clean. The animal’s hide
was full of ticks. On mentioning this to the
stockman, Hann tells that the latter admitted he
knew it all the time, but the official statement was
that the run was clean and, therefore, &c., &c.
The Rev. D. F. Barry, late, rector of St-
John’s College, Sydney, was a pleasing figure
about Manly and other suburbs for many years.
His death at Kerang (Vic.) puts finis to his pro-
posed biography of the late Archbishop Vaughan
—a work which he fondly regarded as the magnum
opus of his life. Much of the MSS. has passed
through the hands of members of the Vaughan
family, who have extolled its tone and aim. Barry
and Vaughan were members of the same religious
order.

To bless your married state,
Lest one day you deplore
Your present frame of mind,
And kneel in vain before

Melb.: “ Met Trenwith to-day. Bit thin-
ner. His shiny little black belltopper has the
mysterious Graham Berryish London polish. His
physique is such that he could take Hancock by
the scruff of the neck, with the right hand, and
Cook with the left and shake them both. So it is
no use their talking of getting into his boots.”
“ Clicquot ” is the modern substitute for
the nectar of the gods, and the gods only drank
nectar because they couldn’t get Clicquot. The
nicest people drink nothing but Clicquot, which
elevates them in the very nicest way. Clicquot,
in fact, is the true philosopher’s drink, trans-
muting this leaden earth at one draught into a
golden Paradise. And there are people who have
never tasted Clicquot ! *
INTERCOLONIAL BAND CONTEST.
The first Intercolonial Band Contest took place
in Sydney Exhibition Building on Nov. 7 and 9th
with great success—bandsmen from all the colo-
nies attending in full regalia. Our own Newtown
boys proved themselves to be the conquerors,
carrying off the £lOO championship and the
Besson and Boosey cups. It is a curious fact to
note that all prize winners (the champions in-
cluded), with few exceptions, had Besson & Co’s
instruments, Boosey & Co. being the next most
successful maker. The contest was well-attended,
and it is to be hoped that this will be the means
of starting many fresh bands. Much attraction
was caused by two fine show-cases from Paling &
Co., exhibiting Besson and Boosey instruments.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Carnage, ridden as Nevvhaven was, would cer-
tainly have run away with the Melb. Cup in which Tar-
coola beat him by half a length. The youngster led all
the way up to the last 50 yards, and for a mile or more
the boy jockey was “pulling his head off” in accordance
with orders. Carnage came in exhausted by his long
struggle with the ill-advised boy on his back, and not a
bit beaten by the pace. He could have done the journey
in faster time had he been allowed to gallop away until
he felt inclined to listen to reason. The continual pulling
represented, without a doubt, a loss of many lengths to
the wayward colt.
* * * 4
S.A. sportsmen, despite the insinuating verdict
of the V.R.C. stewards, decline to believe that David
James, the owner of Broken Hill, has ever been a party to
a horse of his being run cronk. James rarely backs his
horses, and does not depend on the game for a living, as
he is one of the wealthiest men in Australia. When
Auraria won last year’s Cup James was one of the smallest
winners among those “ in the know.”
* * * •
A tout, who holds forth under the name of
“ Ascot ” in Melb. ’Erald, has either committed perjury
or retired from business, probably the former. “In my
notes yesterday,” wrote this luckless oracle, a week before
the Derby, “/ stated that Newhaven was at a false price
for the Derby, and after their appearance 2 to 1 was
freely offered against the son of Oceana.” Then he pro-
ceeded to explain how Newhaven aforesaid was going
from bad to worse in his gallops. The animal had no
chance. “ Ascot,” not content with knocking him out,
with one stroke of a terrible pen, to 2 to 1 for the Derby,
was determined to do the public another service by ex-
posing the hopelessness of the impostor’s Cup-chance, as
follows : “ If Newhaven wins the Melbourne Cup—well, I
won’t eat him, but I’ll give up touting.” There is much
pathos in the career of a man who wears a check suit and
a horse-shoe pin, and rises at 5 a.m. to acquire “ informa-
tion ” which leads to nothing better than that.
* • * •
George Upward, who knows what is a “ good
thing ” at a regatta when he sees one, doesn’t seem to be
impressed by the goodness of “ good things” on the turf.
A lot of horses, remarks G.U., are flogged along at top
speed for the last half of an average racing-journey,
jostling one another as they go, and finally Beelzebub wins
by the length of your umbrella. This lucky animal is the
“ good thing.” The jockey would probably have made
his rush earlier if he hadn’t been blocked, in which case
he might have “ come too soon,” and then any one of
three or four others would have proved a “ good thing ”
instead of Beelzebub.

Steadfast, by Nordenfeldt from Nellie Moore,
was sold in Melbourne last week for 42 guineas. J. E.

A Northern gravedigger drew the big prize in a
Tatt.’s sweep four years ago. He threw down his spade
and took to horse-backing, and so far he is miles ahead.
His latest was Cremorne and Newhaven (£1000), and he
refused to hedge a copper.
* « * *
One very tempting dream “tip” for the Melb.
Cup came from a Jewish lady, the sister of an experienced
punter, who dreamt that the three winning numbers on
the cards for the treble event—Caulfield Cup, Derby, and
Melbourne Cup—were 4. 1. 4. The first two numbers duly
came off. Cremorne was No. 4 on the card and New-
haven was No. 1, the dreamer and her fair friends backing
the tip each time. The writer hasn’t heard whether Old
Nick persuaded them to dash all their winnings upon No.
4 for the Melbourne Cup. He hopes not. The super-
natural information broke down in its third leg, so to
Bpeak.
* * * *
The saddest (recorded) attempt at picking the
Cup-winner was that of a Melb. ’Erald correspondent,
who wrote the names of prominent Cup horses upon some
ducks’-eggs which were hatched shortly before the event.
“ The strange part,” he said, “is that the idea was sug-
gested with a view to finding a dead-bird, and one died
almost as soon as it came out of the shell. This dead-bird
was ‘ Devon.’ ” The Bulletin is haunted by a brain-pic-
ture of the infatuated poultry-breeder squatting for hours
beside the maternal bird that he might raise it from the
warm eggs every time his keen ear detected the crack of a
shell, with a view to the discovery of a dying duckling.
What a cranky vigil!

The popular Mr. Rowley Pickering (“ Nemo,”
of Sydney Mail), who has been 28 years on the Sydney
press, and for 26 years of that time in the S.M. Herald
office, has resigned his position with a view to ruralising
for a year or two. Rowley takes with him into retirement
the best wishes of all.

The other day secretary Byron Moore had a few
sensible remarks to make concerning the wail of the
“ flattite ” who considers himself unfairly treated at
Flemiugton races in not being supplied with much more
than a full view of the sport. The flattite, as B.M. might
have pointed out, is an uninvited dead-head reviling the
management for not feeling anxious about his well-being.
On the other side of the course people buy admission to
the Stand or Hill, and their interests are studied on sound
commercial principles. They provide the show. Visitors
to the Flat don’t rank as patrons of the entertainment,
and have no claim to the smallest consideration. If they
can afford the price of a reserved place they ought to
contribute it, if they can’t stand the expense they have
no business to be. at Flemington at all. Horse-racing is
not a healthy game for impecunious mortals. Yet the
non-productive army of free passers has devoured a
small percentage of the V.R.C. profits. Deadheads have
a starting-board which gives them as much information
as it gives to folks who pay the piper. Also, they are
furnished with water-taps and other accommodation
which public decency demands,, and which, in all other
public places, is charged to the public at large. Here it
is enjoyed by one section only of the public at the cost of
a club which the other section supports.
Touching the complaint that officials are sent
around the Flat in a cart to gather up any boxes devoted
to the elevation of bookmakers, Byron Moore explains
that the same thing would be done in the reserve if it
were necessary. Bookmakers perched on boxes are con-
trary to the Act anywhere, whilst bookmakers standing
on high in order that they may the more easily capture
the coin of punters who haven’t spared a red cent to the
show, are adding insult to illegality. It is time for the
wail of the flattite to cease. Flemington racecourse was
a bit of public land granted to the V.R.C. on the same
terms as the Melb. Cricket Club holds its reserve. At a
cricket-match there isn’t any free standing space ; at a
Cup race there is. In the one case the right to grumble
seems to be admitted along with the non-producers. In
the other case complaints are not heard, for the reason
that the would-be complainants have not where to lay
their dead-heads.

Yet another St. Simon sire for N.S.W. The
Dangars have bought for their Neotsfield Stud the
unraced Positano (St. Simon—Ponza). Ponza is by
Springfield from Napoli, by Macaroni from Sunshine, by
Thormanby—a pedigree bristling with the best running
blood extant.

Anti-cyclist: “As soon as I can afford to buy a
bike, I shall buy a horse.”
As a good Orangeman, Stanbury should have
won the Thames waterman’s prize—-Dogget’s Coat and
Badge. Dogget, the founder, was an Ulsterite, who gave
the prize to commemorate the pious and immortal Wil-
liam.

Swimmer G. Cavill seems to have struck a happy
hunting-ground in American waters. His ’Frisco trip did
not eventuate in anything noteworthy ; he had only one
quarter-mile race, and a showman swim across the Golden
Gate. Cavill returns to America in April to prosecute a
considerable programme. He is a good long-distance
swimmer, and whether he is the best long-distance swim-
mer in Australia is a question which this country would
rather concede than put to the test. This country can’t
stand long-distance swimming, or 25-mile hicycle races, or
a week’s club-swinging, or a long sermon, or any other
thing which from its nature is liable to merge itself into
eternity.
* * * *
O. W. Bennett, of Aus. cycling fame, is back
from England, his birthplace. He says he is sorry he ever
visited the world’s retail shop again : “ It’s the home of
drizzle, dreariness, and dirt; thank God for the Australian
sunshine.”
He saw the trio—Megson, Payne, and Lewis —
cycle themselves into public ridicule. The climate de-
pressed them to death, says Bennett. “ One day when
the sun by some strange caprice shone really warm, the
three met Michael, the Welsh wonder, on the road ; and
they gave Michael all he wanted. But when it came to
racing on the track they failed pitifully. I saw them and
I prayed for the earth to open and swallow me. I couldn’t
have imagined them showing with such utter feebleness.
It’s the climate, the English climate ; after Australia it’s a
plague.
“ Compared with the circumstances of English
cycling, our racing here is as pure as a lily. The riders
are above our men in social status, but the jobbery and
trickery winked at upon the tracks would make the
wickedest Aus. cyclist tremble. The big monopolists who
run pacing teams can make this or that man win at plea-
sure. The pacing there is the art of cycling arts. A man
well-paced is picked up by quad after quad without a jar,
without a tremor, without a suggestion of variation in
gait, and he is drawn along at a swiftly uniform pace
which will almost pull him to victory in spite of himself.
But if they don’t want a man to win they’ll pace him
atrociously ; they’ll slow down, they’ll jump away, they’ll
rush in a sprint and leave him broken up and stone-blind
with exertion. Given our men here fit and well, and the
Englishmen fit and well, I think our fellows would come
out of the contest with great credit.”

The lily-white amateurs of Melb. managed last
Saturday’s meeting as badly as usual, with the result that
the programme finished about an hour late. The attend-
ance was chiefly confined to the stand and the reserve,
one side of the ground consisting of a beautiful green
slope unbroken by a single figure. Wally Kerr seemed
all out of condition, judging by the three races he started
in, for he was beaten fairly and squarely each time. Gil-
lespie beat him by a wheel in the Mile Championship,
after leading for the last lap with Kerr making desperate
efforts to get by. Berry, in the Half-mile Handicap, was
passed by the Sydney crack 100yds. from home, but came
up on the outside and finished a foot ahead, after a great
sprint. Both fell on passing the post, and both, with
more pluck than sense, came up to the post in the Five-
mile Championship. Here Scott, a red-headed youngster,
went out half-a-lap from home, and finished with Berry,
Kerr, and Gillespie following, with about 6in. between
each.
On his Saturday’s riding, Archer Berry—son of
the Vic. Speaker—shows himself amongst the most
promising of this season’s batch of Vic. cyclists. He starts
a trifle late—he is 23 now— but possesses both sprint and
stamina.
One of last Saturday’s cycling amateurs created
great excitement in the dressing-room by producing a
razor and carefully shaving his legs before appearing on
the track 1 Bilmartin watched the operation with a grin
that was worth pounds to see. The same competitor an-
nounced loudly that that occasion would be his last ap-
pearance on the racing-track, as he did not think it right
“ for a gentleman amateur to compete before people who
had paid for admission.”
That great athlete, Roseingrave, the Irish cham-
pion (where is O’lsaac, by the way ?), got through without
a defeat, annexing the pole jump, the 120yds. hurdle, the
long jump, and the high-jump championships without
much trouble. Next to Rosey, the most prominent
athletic figure was that of C. H. Watson, a powerfully-
built member of the Melbournians, who secured the 100
and 200 yd. championships, besides running second to the
Hibernian’s long jump of 22ft. Bin. with one of 21ft. lin.
“Jimmy” Doyle, holder of the Australian high-jump re-
cord, seconded to Roseingrave in that event, being cap-
able of only sft. 6jin. as against his best of sft. lOin.
The programme, which was the only well-
arranged part of the whole show, showed the Vic. 100yds.
record as 9 9-10 sec. Nine-tenths of a second is cutting
things a trifle fine.
A particularly silly arrangement was reckon-
ing the length of the long jump from the nearer side of a
white plank sunk in the earth as a mark. This caused
the competitors to take off from the hard board with their
spiked shoes or else lose six inches from their jump. All
but Roseingrave chose the latter course. Bv the way,
Roseingrave, unlike other athletes, wears spikes on the
heel as well as on the sole of his foot.
George Turner, the Vic. Premier’s son, trained
hard for the sports until he heard Wally Kerr was going
to start. Then he decided that he couldn’t strike form,
and stood off on Saturday. Now he’s wild enough to
throw eggs at himself.
“ Hooroo for Ireland ! ” yelled an excited
Milesian in the grand-stand on Roseingrave’s fourth win
“ Fetch out yer blanky Orangemin ter bate thot.”

The “resting” Bilmartin, who has frequently
announced his contempt for “ bi-cycling” unless he hap-
pens to be a competitor, was present at the amateur
meeting at St. Kilda on Saturday, and watched every
event with evident interest. Is Bill meditating re-in-
statement as an amateur? Just fancy the iron-jawed

Barrister Coldham, who opposed Premier Turner
in the Fatman interest at last St. Kilda election, is one of
the principals in the movement to prevent the amateur
cyclists amalgamating with Vic. League of Wheelmen, and
one of those who would support a split of the former
should such a consummation be effected. Yet this same
Mr. Ooldham, who is such a fervent barracker for “ purity
of the sport” and lily-white amateurism, puts off his prin-
ciples in his leisure moments to shoot pigeons for cash
sweepstakes. Which somehow recalls (we have long hun-
gered for a chance to lug it in) the story of the eminent
counsel who, finding a poor street-walker sitting on the
doorstep of his chambers, said, “My good woman you
have no right here.” “No,” replied the frail one, “I
have no right; lam only a wigless prostitute.”
A fielder at the Brassey Cycle Sports laid a level
half-sov. against Parsons, and refused to pay on losing;
he was run in, but the P.M. said it wasn't welshing as he
did not bolt, and advised prosecutor that he had only a
civil remedy. Prosecutor met the fielder outside and
with a big stick recovered the 10s.

Scorching is doomed in Austria. Trying a
charge of reckless riding, the Bench ruled that “ the
cyclist must always keep his machine under control and
possess such skill that in a moment of danger he can in-
stantly bring it to a standstill or dismount.” Further,”
the cyclist who lifts both hands from the handlebar
thereby commits a police offence.”

When a certain team of Australian athletes left
for the old world the management had much trouble in
getting one member away from his too fiery affinity.
Ultimately he was persuaded to forswear roses and rap-
tures for duty and dumb-bells, but on touching a seaport
500 miles from his starting-point, the steamer was met by
the lady, who had meanwhile travelled overland. Another
protracted argument ensued, but the management scored
again, and the passionate damsel was despatched home-
ward. No sooner had the amorous Australian touched
foreign land than he cabled for the apple of his eye to
join him. Did she? Well, just look at his record-sheet

S.A. Cricket Association and S.A. Wheelmen’s

Gus Kearney, the erst JEssendon footballer,
carried off Vic. tennis championship from holder Dunlop
last Saturday practically by one stroke. Each had won
two sets, and when 22 sets of the final had been played,
Dunlop had scored 40 to Kearney’s 30. Then a soft ball
came apparently right into his hands. But as he rose to
strike, it grazed the top of the net and broke sidewavs,
giving his opponent the advantage. At the 28th game
Kearney secured the necessary points and the champion-
ship. Miss Phoebe Howitt, a daughter of Dr. Howitt, won
the Ladies’ Singles, and with her sister the Doubles. Each
of these wins was for the second time, giving the agile
girls final possession of a couple of massive silver trophies.

A Bulletin correspondent:—lf you ever have
the christening of a racehorse, don’t call him “ Robbo ”
or any name commencing with “R.” It is a luckless
initial. No winner of a Melb. Cup, nor sire of a winner,
bore it; neither is it in the list of Maribyrnong Plate or
Caulfield Cup winners. It only appears in the Vic. Derby
twice, borne by Robin Hood and Rufus. The former was
drowned in the City of Melbourne wreck, and the latter
seems never after to have been heard of. Now for a few
good and favorite horses who carried this unlucky initial:
Richmond, sire of many a fine animal, and himself pluck
to the hoofs, was fluked out of a Melb. Cup by Wollomai.
Robinson Crusoe, in his short career, deserved better
than he got. What a pot boiled over when Ruenalf failed
in the Cup a couple of years ago ! Why dilate on the
luckless Richelieu ? —and Resolute seems equally unlucky
to-day. Englishmen will remember how Bend Or beat
the favorite and better horse Robert the Devil in the
English Derby. Redleap is the exception to prove the rule.

In some parts of the North Island of Maoriland
the Maoris have annual races, where oats are received as
entries and disbursed as stakes. Here is a copy of the
rules posted at one of these “oats meetings” (held at
Havelock, near Napier) (1) This race for horses that
have never won a race excee ling £2 and up to £lOO. (2)
If two horse come to deadhead, the stake will pay out
to two of them and the dividend to the two. (3) If a man
protess the first horse past the post, the dividend will pay
to the first horse that past the post. (4) We allowed any
jockey to ride at this race, a man cannot protess. (5)
There are 6 hurdle at this race. (6) The club don’t allow
any bookmaker on the ground. (7) The race will start at
10 o’clok. (8) We do not allowed any horseman to go on
the ground.

On a Sydney suburban course, one of the very
“ smartest ” trainers called the handicapper aside and
asked him particularly “to watch the running of his
horse, which had only been in hand three weeks.” Now,
before starting for the course, the horse had got fairly
stuffed with bran—probably wandered from his box to
the feed-room—and the owner’s instructions to jockey
were : “ Make every post a winning one.” During the
running of the race owner and handicapper stood together.
The bran seemed rather to agree with the gee, and he
rounded into the straight with a strong lead, the handi-
capper remarking to the owner, “ I’m watching him care-
fully, old man! ” And as the horse finished, with his
field nearly distanced, the owner almost fell down dead
as the handicapper, putting his glasses away with
thoughtful mien, shook him heartily by the hand with
the remark—“ If that’s three weeks’ work, in the name of
thunder what’ll he be like in six ! ”

The best and handiest means to locate a tyre-

Water is not always available in quantity to fill the tyre

slightest puncture is, and repair is easy as falling off «

The science of snatching tickets from winnen
as they go to get paid by the cash fielders is getting quite
acclimatised on Australian racecourses. At one course s

from the mugs who want their money, and clear out in
the crowd. If the mug makes any outcry, a robbery-

“ Every day,” writes a bike-expert to The Bul-

though they were the reins of a run-away war-horse,
to get out of the way of trams and cabs. Nearly all lady
riders take several shots at turning a corner. To swing
the machine round with easy grace, all that is needed is
to incline the body to and press the handle on the side to
which it is desired to turn, and keep the pedals going all
the time—in the city one’s life often depends upon good
steering.”

Naif-Yearly Report of tbe PirectorS,
With the Accounts for THE HALF-YEAR to 13th APRIL, 1896. Presented to the Proprietors at
the Half-yearly General meeting, held on THURSDAY, Ist OCTOBER, 1896.
REPORT.
The Directors submit to the Proprietors the balance-sheet as at 13th April last, with the profit
account for the half-year to that date. After providing for rebate on bills current, for British and
colonial rates and taxes, and for all bad and doubtful debts, the net profit for the half-year amounted
to £40,568 10s. The addition of £11,653 14s. 5d., brought forward from the previous half-year, gives a
disposable balance of £52,222 4s. 5d., of which the dividend declared will absorb £40,000, leaving
£12,222 4s. sd. to be carried forward to next account.
Business generally in the colonies during the half-year has shown signs of improvement, and a
slightly better demand for property is reported. The coming season, too, promises to be more favor-
able for squatters and agriculturists. The “ tick ” pest amongst cattle is causing anxiety in some
districts of Queensland, but the Government are taking active measures to isolate the infection.
The advance in the value of wool, mentioned in the last report, has not been maintained, "and the
frozen meat trade still continues depressed, though some improvement in the latter has recently taken
place.
The bank’s business, as is indicated by the figures of the balance-sheet, shows an increase upon
that of the preceding half-year, though, unfortunately, the low rates prevailing prevented a corres-
ponding improvement in the profit.
The dividend declared is at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, or £1 per share for the half-year
and will be payable, free of income tax, in London and in the colonies, on the 2nd October. '

London, September 14, 1896.
Ed. Bulletin, —The absurd bicycle craze is a
Striking instance of the extent to which the unthinking
multitude can be “kidded” into following a fashionable
fad. As an exercise, cycling is manifestly injurious,
because, while it throws a severe strain upon vital organs,
it cramps and distresses them, preventing their free and
natural action. Running, swimming, boxing, club-
swinging, dumb-bells, cricket and tennis are all incom-
parably superior, for the simple reason that the person
indulging in any one of these carries his body in nature’s
attitude, thus allowing his vital organs the free and
healthful play demanded by nature. If a man cycles
with upright attitude, then he gets off at every hill, and
walking up it counteracts the injurious effects of the
game. To ride up-hill the cyclist must bow his neck and
plug. On plain road the cycle (barring fresh-air con-
siderations) gives no better exercise than the sewing-
machine, and no one regards the sewing-machine as an
unmixed blessing. The man who has begun cycling as a
child, and taken no other form of exercise, will not have
the leg-development of the runner or swimmer, while his
chest will be the flat chest of a tape-worm. The fact that
a few smaller lights of the medical profession patronise the
cycle, shows that several little doctors are as big fools as
the rest of cycling mankind ; some doctors play football
or ride steeplechases, but their doing so does not show
that football or steeplechasing are reasonably free from
chance of accident or death. The great bulk of the
cyclists who say that the game does them good, are over-
grown children exhilarated with a new toy. Others who
praise it are people who never had a sweat or a bath until
cycling came along with its drenching of sweat and mud,
necessitating much soap and water. When the heated
imagination of cycle-mad humanity cools down to the
conditions of sanity, the cyclf enthusiast will be lodged
m a lunatic asylum, and there, under the influence of
cycling’s horrible vibratory disease, he will jabber eternally
to himself about the virtues of the wheel. — Key.

The wheel is making a system for itself in Aus-
tralia. The Vic. Wheelmen’s League has arranged with
all Vic. hotels for special rates. The N.S.W. Cycling
Tourists’ Union is fixing the same thing in its pro-
vince. N.S.W. has the Wheelman paper; Vic. has the
Australian Cyclist. Cash prizes are increasing in num-
ber and amount. More riders are being retained, and
riders’ salaries are being raised. The Wheelmen’s Leagues
are all prosperous or have only themselves to blame where
they are not so. One recent move of N.S.W. League was
to make Percy Hunter general secretary at £3 per week, i
Hunter also has a share in Sydney Wheelman.


WONDERFUL
Blood-Purifying Effect
—OF
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. Charles Stephenson, a well-known
Railway Employe at Kalapoi, New
Zealand, writes:
'SS'
‘About ten years ago, while en-
gaged in shunting, my foot caught
between the rails, and my leg was
fractured below the knee. It healed
in time, but I have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and
have been obliged, at times, to wear
a bandage. About a year ago it be-
came much worse, and I feared I
should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I did so, and
after taking four bottles the swell-
ing disappeared, and I have not
been troubled with it since.”

An Italian professor finds a decoction of
eucalyptus-leaves a powerfully antidotal stomach-
injection in strychnine poisoning cases.
In far Northern S.A. sheep have been
trying to keep alive by eating dead rabbits. One
squatter has lost 26,000, and another (Mortlock,
M.P.) 35,000 during the drought.
A Florida surgeon finds that the bile of a
rattlesnake applied freely to a bite of that snake,
and poured into an incision at the site, not only
guards against death, but actually prevents swel-
ling and other symptoms. The remedy, in view
of antitoxin successes lately, seems far from un-
likely. It is certainly worth investigating in
snake-infested Australia.
Melb. : ‘ ‘ All ecclesiasticism nowadays must
be allied with show business, from the Synagogue,
which calleth in the aid of Fitzgerald’s circus
unto the very Hallelujah rakers on the muck-heap
of sin. Bills in my suburb notify: ‘ Salvation
Army. The Musical Lilliputians. Exhibition of

cises, as Taught in Our Band of Love.’ More
innocuous, anyhow, than the Band of Love teach-

On the island of Panaieti, near the
coast of British New Guinea, the natives bury
their dead under the earthen floor of their huts.
Phew ! Traders and missionaries are not neces-
sarily anthropologists, or perhaps they would ex-
plain a custom also common on the same island.
A corpse is allowed to rest in its grave for a year
only. Then the duty of exhuming “ the dust-not-
quite-to-dust ” falls to the lot of some old woman,
who scrapes the bones carefully and well oils them,
after which they are hung up for three months in
the roof to smoke. The final rite of burial consists
in securely fastening up the brown skeleton in a
grass mat and hiding it away underground in some
unknown and remote bush spot.

X.Z. : “Have animals humor ? lately asked
an English magazine. Mr. Walter Gibson, of
Glenholm, Dromana, Vic., kept for several years
a tame kangaroo as a children’s pet, which ran
loose on his estate. It’s great joy was to quickly
slip in among the cows, grip the tail of one with
its forepaws, and, with a vigorous kick with its
powerful hind leg, start that bewildered cow on a
mad race round the paddocks, using the tail as
reins. ‘Joey’ was shot one day by a Melb.
cockney sport who mistook him for a warrigal
kangaroo. Seen to do it by a local resident, the
shootist got a big licking, and had to carry the
corpse home on his back.”

Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894
Dear Sir, In the year of 18711 was eight da 's
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
u* a m a rea, k difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Eriday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your

be a blessing to suffering humanity.

The moral of a recently well-advertised-
in-advance Sydney operation: Keep quiet until
you have got the bullet out.
Rev. P. Y. Dwyer, president of W. Mait-
land R.C. College, and son of Public-school In-
spector Dwyer, of Sydney, is the nominee of the
bishops for the Catholic assistant-bishopric of

Catholic bishop. He is 38 years of age.
Camille Flammarion, the French astrono-
mer, has found that plants grown under a cover-
ing of red glass increase to nearly 16 times their
original size in the course of 12 weeks, whereas the
same plants under blue glass remain stationary.
Possibly this law holds good with regard to human
beings. If so many apparent anomalies are cap-
able of easy explanation. For instance, the heads
of some eminent public men must have grown to
their present size under red glass—and their brains
under blue.

A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
OP A SNOW STORM IN
AFRICA^
CHIEF CONSTABLE HUDSON COULD
NOT GET SHELTER.
A terrible snow storm occurred awhile ago in
Griqualand East, South Africa. Mr. E. W.
Hudson, Chief Constable of Tsolo, in a letter
dated 15th July, writes as follows concerning it: —
“ Last winter, whilst on duty, I got caught in a
heavy snow storm in the mountains and could not
get shelter of any kind. The result was that I
got rheumatics all down my left side. I now
think it my duty to thank you for the benefit I
have derived from Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. The
pain in my shoulder and hip was simply awful. I
could not move, nor could I take a long breath
without pain. My duty is mostly on horseback,
and I cannot describe what I suffered at times
when I had to go on duty. I became so low, both
in mind and body, that I was afraid I should have
to give in. I tried all sorts of remedies, embroca-
tions, etc. Some relieved me for a time, but
nothing permanent. Some of my friends recom-
mended me to try Dr. William’s Pink Pills. I
never did believe in patent medicines, and it was
some time before I took the advice, which I regret
now, as I might have been saved months of suffer-
ing had I listened earlier. I had an idea that
these medicines act like a spur on a jaded horse,
livening him up for a bit, and then leaving him
sorrier than ever. But this was not the case with
Dr. William’s Pink Pills. I sent for some, and
gave them a fair trial. This was nearly three
months ago. I must say I felt benefit from them
after taking the first box. It is a month since I
took the last, and I have refrained from writing
to you before, in order to test if the cure was
lasting. I am fifty-one years old, and it is now
no trouble to me to ride fifty miles in the day. I
feel quite a youngster again, and feel at present
like finishing the other fifty years.” Mr. Hudson
concludes his letter, which may be seen at any
time at the office of Dr. Williams’ Medicine Com-
pany, Cape Town, by ordering another six boxes
for one of his friends who wishes to try them.
Here, then, is yet another proof of the marvel-
lous efficiency of. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. This
marvellous medicine, the discovery of an eminent
physician, after years of experiment and thought,
is a certain cure for rheumatism, Sciatica, Lum-
bago, and Neuralgia. It is also a specific for In-
digestion, Dyspepsia, Sleeplessness, Headache,
and general Debility, and as a remedy for all
female ailments, such as Anaemia, Irregularities,
Hysteria, &c., it stands alone and unrivalled.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are obtainable from all
leading chemists, or from the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Coy., Queen’s Place, Sydney, who will for-
ward (post paid), on receipt of stamps or post
order, 1 box for 2s. 9d., or J-dozen for 14s. 9d.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints &A, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DU ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities —a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to. If you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a

The English tobacco firm of Wills and Co.

Queensland bacteriologist Pound has hopes
of coping with the rabbit plague. He intends to
adopt the plan by which M. Pasteur cleared out
the bunnies on Madame Pommery’s estates in
Prance. Australia, however, has already dozens

It’s when the estate measures a million square
miles that the trouble commences.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
A hapless leper was discovered the other
day at Cairns. - Brisbane officials wired to Cairns,
ordering the suffering man to be despatched, per
Pearless, back to the islands, along with 30 other
islanders. Boat refused passenger, whereupon
the Kanaka took up lodgings in an old boiler, but
was expelled by police. Camped next under an old
fig-tree—expelled again. Resorted then to his
fellow Kanakas, who expelled him once more. At
present, he is probably disseminating leprous
virus among the aboriginals, or dropping a section
of a lumpy lobe into the soup at some fresh pub.
which is indulging in the common bush-luxury of
a cheap cook.
The valiant baker of a Sydney suburb,
lately mulct in sundry five shillingses for
carrying around light-weight bread in a basket,
holding still that the light-weight was accidentally
brought about, threatens to startle the court if
ever taken there on a similar charge. The
“ startle ” is to be the resurrection of George IV.
as a legal barrier. It appears that the George IV.
Act, dealing with bakers, Specifies that no travel-
ling baker need carry scales or otherwise profess
to weigh unless his barrow or cart is drawn by a
beast of burden. This Act was tinkered in the
time of William IV., but the specified clause was
allowed to stand, and in that state the law has
come into force in N.S.W. Can, then, a baker
who hawks with a basket be called a “ beast of
burden ”? and if not, is not the knight of the
paper-hat as fairly entitled to resurrect the unre-
pealed George IV. on a flour-and-water question
as was N:S. W. Government a few years ago to
resurrect the unrepealed George IV. on a con-
spiracy question ? ”
Mr. Arthur Griffith wishes to notify intend-
ing patentees that he has commenced practice as a
Patents and Trade Marks Agent at 39 Castlereagh-
street, Sydney. He has entered into arrange-
ments with leading agents in Europe, America,
Australasia, and South Africa, so that inventors
may rely upon having their interests protected.
Mr. Griffith’s charges will, in all cases, be so
moderate as to place a patent within the reach of
the poorest inventor. For £2O, exclusive of the
cost of plans, Mr. Griffith will obtain Provisional
Protection for any invention in the seven Austra-
lasian colonies and Great Britain.*
A Russian woman, who was in the habit
of swallowing everything she could get hold of,
when emptied the other day by the surgeons
yielded 37 different articles, including a fork,
several inches of iron bar, two spoons, a needle, a
piece of lace, two nails, four bits of glass, eight
buttons, a key, &o. On recovery, she toured
along with her recent contents, and made enough
in a few months to retire on a competency for life.

A Bulletin man who recently did a walk-
ing tour from Sydney to Mudgee struck one not-
able fact. He counted over 100 more or less dead-
beat swagmen on the road, and all but five of them
were heading towards Sydney. The great object
of almost all Government relief works is to gather
up the Sydney unemployed—because it is the
Sydney unemployed who are in evidence at the
Statue and in deputations to the Premier and in
processions along Macquarie-street, and who are a
beastly nuisance generally—and shunt them out
West on to scrub-cutting and forest-thinning and
irrigation jobs. The procession one meets on the
roads heading Sydney-wards consists largely of
these derelicts walking back. There is a lot of
sound wisdom in the Bogan scrub-cutting philo-
sophy. It takes the unemployed a long time to get
there, and, even if the job doesn’t amount to much,
he generally stays a little while, and then, even if
his boots hold out, it takes him two or three
months to walk back, and the city is free of him in
the meantime. A really enterprising policy of
sending all the unemployed to dig a stupendous
dam at Broken Hill would be the best thing of all,
however. When the job gave out most of them,
rather than face the great plain track to Cobar,
would head for Adelaide, and be permanently
stranded there.

eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-st root, Mel-

takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to

A Criterion of Cleverness .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was about 7 a.m. when I strolled over
from the office of the Quarran-Yarran Times
—of which influential organ I was then editor—to
have a yarn with Pooler, the landlord of the
Royal Hotel. We had been chatting for a few
minutes when old Dr. Miggs, looking, as he always
did at that hour of the morning, very seedy and
very shaky, dropped in for his usual restorer-
half a tumbler of Three Star with an egg beaten
up in it. After a brief “ Good morning, doctor,
I "turned my back on him and looked out of t he
window. It would have been cruel to watch the
old man taking, with his hand and head shaking
together, his first drink for the day. But after he
had swallowed it he was ready for conversation.
“ How did Mrs. get through her trouble .
enquired Pooler. ,„ ~ ,
“ Splendidly, sir, splendidly,” was the reply;
“ she was in my hands ! ” ~
There was, of course, nothing more to be said
in the way of interrogation after that. But Dr.
Miggs, growing more affable as the brandy got its
work in, volunteered the information that Mr.
was the father of another fine boy. Then
he (the doctor) began to grumble after his cus-
tomary fashion. ,
“ Why the devil,” he said, didn’t they send
for young Martin instead of rousing me up in the
middle of the night ? ” .
As there was no answer forthcoming he supplied
one himself. .... , ~ ,
“ Because, sir,” he exclaimed, they don t put
any faith in these young upstarts, with their new-
fangled theories and their scientific airs, who pre-
tend to know more than men old enough to bo
their grandfathers. That’s why they didn’t send
for young Martin. ”
The old man, after delivering this statement
with a triumphant chuckle, left us and went on
1 “'isn’t he a wonder!” said Pooler. “Why,
last night, when came riding into the town-
ship hell-for-leather to fetch him to the missus, he
was in here more’n half-drunk. I straightened
him up as well as I could by pumping water on
his head and soda down his throat till he was fit
for his business And see how he pulled it
through ! ” ,
“ But, confound it, Pooler, he wasn’t sober when
he came in here this morning ! ”
“Well, of course, I don’t mean to say he was
quite sober when he left last night. But he was
sober enough to know what he was about and
what more would you want ? ”
I said that if I had been in Mr. ’s place I
should have wanted a great deal more, and would
have seen that I got it, too.
Pooler laughed a trifle scornfully. You
haven’t been long enough in Quarran-Yarran to
know the ways of the people,” he said, “or you
wouldn’t talk in that style. Why, Mr. , if
you paid him, wouldn’t have anybody but old
Si to attend either himself or his missus,
er would his missus.”
“ But, good God, man ! ” I exclaimed, in a land
of rage, “you don’t mean to tell me that you
seriously believe that a man who, according to your
own story and to what I know myself, is always
more or less drunk, and sometimes trembling on
the verge of D.T.’s, is the sort of person to be
entrusted with the issues of life and death . It
you do you must be mad.”
“ Mad or not mad,” replied Pooler, flicking the
dust off his bottles with an apron, “ I mean to say
that Ido believe in old Dr. Miggs. He drinks
like a fish, I know, but he’s damned clever. And,
what’s more to the point, he makes no secret Qt His
drinking. He could do it at home on the quiet it
he liked, but he doesn’t like, and everybody thinks
all the more of him for it.”
Now Pooler was one of the few intelligent men
in Quarran-Yarran. If this were his settled con-
viction, what could be expected from the rest of
the people ?
I have noticed that m the city, when a ravorite
medical man, with a weakness for the bottle, is
referred to, the formula is—“ He’s damned clever,
but he drinks like a fish. ”
In the bush it is put in the converse way—
“He drinks like a fish, but (meaning therefore)
he’s damned clever.”
* • * *
Later in the day I was talking with Dr.
Martin, who had come to Quarran-Yarran some
months before in the hope of being able to estab-
lish a modest practice in that old-fashioned bush
village. After relating the conversation I had
had with Pooler that morning, I said (being- on
somewhat familiar terms with him): “ Now look
here, doctor, I want you to tell me candidly,
leaving aside any prejudice you may have against
him, because the people here are pig-headed
enough to prefer him to you with all your up-to-
date medical knowledge—l want you to tell me
what you think of his real skill as a medical man.
“Well,” replied Dr. Martin in a judicial tone,
“ speaking candidly, he works on principles that
were shown to be idiotic about a century ago.
Why, the damned old mountebank actually still
believes in bleeding for fever ! At the same time
I think he is quite good enough for the patients.”
We had some more talk on the subject, and
then, as I was going, Dr. Martin said: “I see
that I shall have to leave this place. It’s too late
now for me to try to work up a reputation as a
drunkard, but if I should ever make another
start in a bush township, you can bet your life I
shall make my first appearance there in an
advanced stage of the horrors. ”
CREEVE ROE.
Bayley, of Bayley’s Reward, died at
Avenel, Vie., of congestion of the liver, aged 31.
He leaves a widow ; no family. Seymour Tele-
graph gives an interesting account of his career: —
Bayley was a Vic. native, and went prospecting in
N.Q. when only 16. He battled round the Towers,
Ilughenden, Normanton, Croydon, and the Palmer. He
landed in W.A. with 305., tramped to Southern Cross and
earned a little money, which he lost in the Bunbury tin-
mines. Then he walked back to Roebourne, and, with a
mate, walked barefooted to the Ashburton, 280 miles, in
nine days. He did well, went to the Murchison and did
better, and had a trip home to Vic. Then he returned to
W.A., reached the Coolgardie district, and with Ford,
dropped on the Reward after a good many months’ un-
profitable hunting.
They had pegged out a prospecting area when Hannan
and Ready, two other well-known prospectors, appeared
on the scene. Bayley and Ford did not relish being dis-
turbed, and at this Bayley, with characteristic cuteness,
showed Hannan a few fair specimens of gold and earnestly
advised him that it was good enough for him (Hannan) to
stay and try the show. Hannan took the bait so readily
that for fear of himself being tracked to a good show of
his own he struck camp and moved off with all haste the
same night. Bayley and Ford were mad with delight to
find in the morning no trace of their visitors. Some few
days after this, however, an accident occurred
to the pair but for which the find would not
have been made public for at least another two
months. A dingo stole all the bacon fat they had in
camp. Their only means of subsistence was on tinned
meats and damper, and great store was set by their bacon.
There was literally nothing to shoot, and scarcely a living
thing except lizards and aborigines to be seen. It was a
case of a trip of 140 miles into Southern Cross (the nearest
town) for stores, so off they went. On their way back
they again met Hannan and Ready on Hunt s survey
track. Hannan and Ready, in turn meeting another
party, were able to tell them, in answer to their questions,
that Bayley was on ahead. These men proved to be
trackers from Southern Cross, sent out by a small ss.
syndicate for the express purpose of tracing Bayley, who,
from his continuous spell in the district and his occa-
sional call for stores, the astute syndicate reckoned must
be on something surprisingly rich.
Owing to Hannan and Ready’s timely guidance the
trackers found out the show. Bayley and Ford showed
their prospecting area duly pegged and warned the men
off the ground. But it was of no use, and it was found
that after digging a trench as near as possible to the
boundary as a blind, these men had prospected on the
area with so much success that they had exposed the cap
of the magnificent reef from which so much was after-
wards won. They were forced to disgorge 200 oz. admitted
to have been taken from this find, and no doubt this was
not the whole. It was now high time for Bayley and
Ford to set to work, and, leaving Ford behind, Bayley
journeyed into Southern Cross, reported the find, and
took out a lease. So rich was the cap of the reef where
exposed that the first stroke of the pick by Ford dislodged
a lump of ore 70oz. in weight containing 40oz. of pure
gold, and they cut out with a tomahawk a piece contain-
ing 140 oz. Afterwards 500 oz. was dollied out in three
days, and the 6cwt. of tailings, which already had
yielded 17500 z. of pure gold, when treated gave
another 2780 z. Bayley and Ford’s troubles now began
in earnest, as, besides having to continally risk
their lives to save the gold in their possession from
theft, they had to keep a very close and constant watch on
the claim. Also, they had the pleasure of hearing of
rushes planned on every hand. At this stage the utter
fearlessness of Bayley stood him in good stead. One
morning Bayley, returning from a short distance, found
that Ford had been unable to prevent a score of men from
assembling on the ground. Bavlev was wrath and ex-
postulated with the men to some good purpose, but the
ringleader, a big burly man, was immovable until Bayley,
stripping to the waist, offered to fight him for 50ft. on the
line of reef as a stake. The fellow at first was eager for
the fray, but eventually withdrew, whereupon several
others began to mutter their willingness. Bayley saw
trouble in store on these terms, and, quickly producing
two revolvers, he declared that he would shoot down like
a dog the first man who moved a step nearer.
The next episode was a jumping case in which the prin-
cipal actor admitted when under examination by Warden
Finnerty that his employers were a lot of the “leading”
men of Perth. The principal witness was one of the
original trackers, but under cross-examination his evi-
dence broke down and Bayley and Ford won the day. It
was also attempted to be shown that the claim was on the
ground of the Hampton Plains Syndicate, who had ex-
clusive mining privileges over a large area. When an
offer, therefore, of £6OOO cash and a sixth interest was
made to Bayley and his mate it is no wonder that they
closed. From the Reward claim the present company in
the first six months of its operations took 52,000 odd
ounces of gold (over £200,000 worth). It is generally
concluded from the name of the mine—Bayley’s Reward
—that Bayley received a substantial sum for the dis-
covery ; but it is not so. The W.A. Govt, refused the re-
ward, only allowing the party as a recompense to each peg
two men's ground.
The latest Referendum vote in Switzer-
land has given a decided majority in favor of
State railway ownership.
Demise : George Anderson, ex-deputy-
master of Melbourne Mint. Mr. Anderson sat
for Glasgow in the Commons from 18G8 to 1885 as
an “ advanced ” Liberal. To Australians, English
Liberalism, even of the advanced school, does not
seem to advance very far. Mr. Anderson was
a believer in the limited-monarchial system, but
was one of those who opposed Disraeli’s jingoism.
For instance, he objected strenuously to the Dizzy
title of “ Empress of India ” for Queen Victoria,
on the ground that “ Queen ” is a democratic title,
while “ Empress ” smacks of autocracy. For his
political services he was, in 1885, appointed by
Gladstone to the charge of Melb. Mint, the
deputy-masterships at Sydney and Melbourne
being the only Australasian positions now in the
gift of the English Government, excluding Gover-
norships. He succeeded to Deputy-Master Delves
Broughton, an erratic and eccentric official from
the London Treasury, who, among other foibles,
conceived the notion of buying 1000 horses as a
present for the Prince of Wales ; to see the
heir to the throne, this official conceived,
driving 1000 beautiful horses down the Strand
would have been a world-enchanting sight.
It became necessary to put Mr. Broughton under
restraint, and his death soon occurred. Mr. Ander-
son (he could have dubbed himself “Major” on
his visiting cards had he been disposed to vaunt
his honors as an amateur soldier) was a man of
splendid physique and appearance, and was un-
doubtedly one of the handsomest men ever in the
Australian Civil Service. He was white-haired
and white-bearded, but no one would have
suspected that his birth dated back to 1819. He
was educated at Edinburgh High School and St.
Andrews University, and was for many years a
merchant in Glasgow. He married in 77, and is
survived by Mrs. Anderson and two children. He
has published many pamphlets on wages, educa-
tion and currency—and a few years ago gave evi-
dence before a Vic. Royal Commission in favor of
10-shilling and 5-shilling bank-notes. It is not
long since he published “ The Agnostic and Other
Poems ” —being the collected verses of his life-
time. He avowed that “The Agnostic” was
written to induce his readers to think out for
themselves the important concerns of Life, Death
and Eternity without taking beliefs second-hand
from parson, priest or presbyter. One of the
characters in the name-poem declares that the
priests cling
to the present world,
Its power, its pomp, its wealth, as if at heart
They held some lingering doubts of one to come.


A newly-invented Yankee drink, which
seems to be the perfection of moist joy, costs five
dollars a time. Four sprigs of mint and three
lumps of sugar are crushed in a dessert-spoonful of
water, and a wine-glass of brandy is added. Next
a pint of champagne. Then two table-spoonfuls
of crushed ice, and slices of pineapple, banana and
orange. Next comes a topping of ice-cream orna-
mented with a few strawberries and raspberries
and three or four rosebuds.
In N.S.W. last year one out of every 343
inhabitants was a lunatic—a known lunatic, that
is, for there is always a fringe of insanity in the
regions Out Back among the lonesome shepherds
and bushmen, which doesn’t come under official
notice until the patient goes into the town to
drink his cheque and tries to set fire to the grog-
shanty. In 1886, which was the best year in the
last 20, there was only one crank to every 379
people. Lunacy gradually grew more prevalent
from 76 to ’B2, then it diminished in an irregular
way till ’B6 ; since then it has increased, and ’95

“ Since using Pears’ Soap
I have discarded all others.”
A Case for the Oracle .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Oracle and I were camped together.
The Oracle was a bricklayer by trade, and had two
or three small contracts on hand. I was “doing a
bit of house-painting. ” There was a plasterer, a
carpenter, and a plumber —we were all t’other-
siders, and old mates, and we worked things
together. It was in Westralia —the Land of
the T’othersiders—and, therefore, ‘ we were not
surprised when Mitchell turned up, early one
morning, with his swag and an atmosphere of salt
water about him.
He’d had a rough trip, he said, and would take
a spell that day and take the lay of the land and
have something cooked for us by the time we came
home ; and go to graft himself next morning.
And next morning he went to work, “ laboring ”
for the Oracle.
The Oracle and his mates, being small contrac-
tors and not pressed for time, had dispensed
with the services of a “laborer,” and had done
their own mixing and hod-carrying in turns.
They didn’t want a laborer now, but the Oracle
was a vague fatalist, and Mitchell a decided one.
So it passed.
The Oracle had a “ Case ” right under his nose-
in his own employ, in fact; but was not aware of
the fact until Mitchell drew his attention to it.
The case went by the name of Alfred O’Briar—
which hinted of a mixed parentage. He was a
small, nervous working-man, of no particular
color, and no decided character, apparently. If he
had a soul above bricks, he never betrayed it. He
was not popular on the jobs. There was some-
thing sly about Alf, they said.
The Oracle had taken him on in the first place
as a day-laborer, but afterwards shared the pay
with him as with Mitchell. O’Briar shouted—
judiciously, but on every possible occasion—for the
Oracle ; and, as he was an indifferent workman,
the boys said he only did this so that the Oracle
might keep him on. If O’Briar took things easy
and did no more than the rest of us, at least one
of us would be sure to get it into his head that he
was loafing on us ; and if he grafted harder than
we did, we’d be sure to feel indignant about that
too, and reckon that it was done out of nastiness
or crawlsomeness, and feel a contempt for him
accordingly. We found out accidentally that
O’Briar was an excellent mimic and a bit of a ven-
triloquist, but he never entertained us with his
peculiar gifts ; and we set that down to churlish-
ness.
O’Briar kept his own counsel, and his history, if
he had one ; and hid his hopes, joys and sorrows,
if he had any, behind a vacant grin, as Mitchell
hid his behind a quizzical one. O’Briar never
resented alleged satire—perhaps he couldn’t see it
—and therefore he got the name of being a cur.
As a rule, he was careful with his money, and was
called mean —not, however, by the Oracle, whose
philosophy was simple, and whose sympathy could
not realise a limit; nor yet by Mitchell. Mitchell
waited.
» * * *
O’Briar occupied a small tent by himself,
and lived privately of evenings. When we began
to hear two men talking at night in his tent, we
were rather surprised, and wondered in a vague
kind of way how any of the chaps could take suf-
ficient interest in Alf. to go in and yarn with him ;
tor, when he was supposed to be sociable, we voted
him a bore ; even the Oracle was moved to admit
that O’Briar was “a bit slow.”
But late one night we distinctly heard a woman’s
voice in O’Briar’s tent. The Oracle suddenly be-
came hard of hearing, and, though we heard the
voice on several occasions, he remained exasperat-
ingly deaf, yet aggressively unconscious of the
fact. “ I have got enough to do puzzling over me
own whys and wherefores,” he said. Mitchell
began to take some interest in O’Briar, and treated
him with greater respect.
But our camp had the name of being the best-
constructed, the cleanest, and the most respectable
in the vicinity. The health-officer and constable-
in-charge had complimented us on the fact, and
we were proud of it. And there were three young
married couples in camp, and also a Darby and
Joan ; therefore, when the voice of woman began
to be heard frequently and at disreputable hours
of the night in O’Briar’s tent, we got uneasy
about it. And when the constable, who was on
night duty, gave us a friendly hint, Mitchell and
I agreed that something must be done.
“ Av coorse, men will be men,” said the con-
stable, as he turned his horse’s head, “ but I
thought I’d mention it. O’Briar is a dacent man
—and he’s one of yer mates. Av coorse. There’s a
bad lot in that camp in the scrub over yander, and
—av coorse. Gud-day to ye, byes.”
* * * *
Next night we heard the voice in O’Briar’s
tent again, and decided to speak to Alf. in a
friendly way about it in the morning. We listened
outside in the dark, but could not distinguish the
words, though I thought I recognised the voice.
“ It’s the hussy from the camp over there ; she’s
got holt of that fool, and she’ll clean him out be-
fore she’s done,” I said. “ We’re Alf’s mate's, any
way it goes, and we ought to put a stop to it.”
“ What hussy ?” asked Mitchell; “ there’s three
or four there.”
“ The one with her hair all over her head,” I
answered.
“Where else should it be?” asked Mitchell.
“ But I’ll just have a peep and see who it is.
There’s no harm in that.”
He crept up to the tent and cautiously moved
the flap. Alf. ’s candle was alight; he lay on his
back in his bunk with his arms under his head,
calmly smoking, We withdrew.
“They must have heard us,” said Mitchell,
“ and she’s slipped out under the tent at the back,
and through the fence into the S3rub.”
Mitchell’s respect for Alf. increased visibly.
* * * *
But we began to hear ominous whispers
from the young married couples, and next Satur-
day night, which was pay-night, we decided to see
it through. We did not care to speak to Alf. until
we were sure. He stayed in camp, as he often did,
on Saturday evening while the others went up
town. Mitchell and I returned earlier than usual
and leaned on the fence at the back of Alf. ’s tent.
We were scarcely there when we were startled
by a “ rat-tat-tat ” as of some one knocking at a
door. Then an old woman’s voice inside the tent
asked : “ Who’s there ? ”
“ It’s me,” said Alf’s voice from the front, “ Mr.
O’Briar from Perth.”
“Mary, go and open the door ! ” said the old
woman. (Mitchell nudged me to keep quiet.)
“Come in, Mr. O’Breer,” said the old woman.
“ Come in. How do you do ? When did you get
back?”
“ Only last night,” said Alf.
“ Look at that now ! Bless us all! And how
did you like the country at all ? ”
“ I didn’t oare much for it,” said Alf. We lost
the thread of it until the old woman spoke again.
“ Have you bad your tea, Mr. O’Breer ? ”
“ Yes, thank you, Mrs. O’Connor. ’
“ Are you quite sure, man?”
“Quite sure, thank you, Mrs. O’Connor.”
(Mitchell trod on my foot.)
“ Will you have a drop of whisky or a glass of
beer, Mr. O’Breer ? ”
“I’ll take a glass of beer, thank you, Mrs.
O’Connor.” i
There seemed to be a long pause. Then the old
woman said, Ah, well, I must get my work done
and Mary will stop here and keep you company,
Mr. O’Breer. The arrangement seemed satisfac-
tory to all parties, for there was nothing more said
for awhile. (Mitchell nudged me again, with
emphasis, and I kicked his shin.)
Presently Alf. said: Mary. And a girls
v°ice s a id, Yes, Alt.
You remember the night I went away,
Mfjy ? ” „
Yes, Alf., I do.
“ I have travelled long ways since then, Mary :
I worked hard and lived close. I didn t make me
fortune, but I managed to rub a note or two
together. It was a hard time and a lonesome time
for me, Mary. lhe summer s awful over there,
and livin s had and dear. You couldn t have any
idea of it, Mary.
No, Alf.
“ I didn't come back so well off as I expected.
“ But that doesn t matter, Alf. _
“I got heart-sick and tired of it, and couldn t
stand it any longer, Mary.
But thats all over now, Alf.; you mustn t
think of it.
“ Your mother wrote to me.”
“ I know she did ”—(very low and gently).
“ And do you know what she put in it, Mary ? ”
“Yes Alf.”
“ And did vou ask her to put it in ? ”
“ Don’t ask me, Alf.”
“ And it’s all true, Mary ? ”
There was no answer, but the silence seemed
satisfactory.
“ And be sure you have yourself down here on
Sunday, Alf., me son.” (“ There’s the old woman
come back ! ” said Mitchell.)
“An’ since the girl’s willin’ to have ye, and the
ould woman’s willin’—there’s me hand on it, Alf.,
me boy. An’God bless ye both.” (“The old
man’s come now,” said Mitchell.)
* * * *
“Come along,” said Mitchell, leading the
way to the front of the tent.
“ But I wouldn’t like to intrude on them. It’s
hardly right, Mitchell, is it? ”
“ That’s all right,” said Mitchell. He tapped the
tent pole.
“Come in,” said Alf. Alf. was lying on his
bunk as before, with his arms under his head,
His face wore a cheerful, not to say happy, ex-
pression. There was no one else in the tent. I
Weis never more surprised, in my life.
“ Have you got the paper, Alf. ? ” said Mitchell,
“Yes. You’ll find it there at the foot of the
bunk. There it is. Won’t you sit down, Mit-
c b e p 9 ”
“ Not to-night,” said Mitchell. “We brought
you a bottle of ale. We’re just goin’ to turn in.”
A/i-ii? iT e if a * d g°od-night. Well, I said to
Mitchell when we got inside, what do you think
of it ? ”
“I don’t think of it at all,” said Mitchell.
“ Do you mean to say you can’t see it now ? ”
“ No, I in dashed if I can, I said. “ Some of
us must be drunk, 1 think, or getting rats. It s
not to be wondered at, and the sooner we get out
of this country the better. ”
“ Well, you must be a fool, Joe,” said Mitchell.
Can’t you see? Alf. thinks aloud.”
“ What?”
“Talks to himself. He was thinking about
going back to his sweetheart. Don’t you know
he’s a bit of a ventriloquist ? ”
* * * *
Mitchell lay awake a long time, in the
position that Alf. usually lay in, and thought.
Perhaps he thought on the same lines as Alf. did
that night. But Mitchell did his thinking in
silence.
We thought it best to tell the Oracle quietly.
He was deeply interested, but not surprised.'
“I’veheerd of such cases before,” he said. But
the Oracle was a gentleman. “ There’s things
that a man wants to keep to himself that ain’t his
business,” he said. And we understood this
remark to be intended for our benefit, and to indi-
cate a course of action upon which the Oracle had
decided, with respect to this case, and which we
in his opinion, would do well to follow.
Alf. got away a week or so later, and we all
took a holiday and went down to Fremantle to
see him off. Perhaps he wondered why Mitchell
gripped his hand so hard and wished him luck so
earnestly, and was surprised when we gave him
three cheers.
“Ah, well! ” remarked Mitchell, as we turned
up the wharf.
“I’ve heerd of such cases before,” said the
Oracle, meditatively. “They ain’t common, but
I’ve heerd of such cases before.
