Smooth as
a Swan
No two people write exactly
alike, hence we speak of character
in writing. But an unsuitable nib
distorts the character, makes writing
laboured and tiring. It is worth
while to take a little trouble in
choosing one’s pen for it is meant to
be a helper and pocket companion
for many years.
'SWAN” Pens are fitted with
the grandest gold nibs made—they
are pointed with hard natural osmi-
iridium from Tasmania; the best
found anywhere in the world. Each
point is ground to a delightful smooth-
ness, but some are broad, some fine,
some turned-up, some oblique.
Choose yours to be exactly
suitable.

AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and find
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s Eumen-
thol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent
abnormal fermentation of the.food, thus allowing the natural digestive ferments to act
and if taken regularly after meals they so
improve the digestion that a strict diet be-
comes ‘unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes are most useful to those who suffer
from Heartburn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

Can Australians Write Fiction?
I have had the effrontery to assert that
Australian writers can’t write! Nothing
etse that I said appears to have mattered
to Bernard Cronin or to Chas. E. Sayers.
Passing over the vulgarity of the former
and the feminine controversial tactics of the
latter, permit me a few remarks in support
of my statement —and then a few words
concerning the suggested remedy.
I am well aware that some good fiction
has been produced here. I have most of
it—written for much less pay than writers
receive nowadays. But that was in yester-
year, before men of literary inclinations
(and the requisite ability) had discovered
“the life austere that waits upon the man
of letters here.” Disillusioned, men like
Dyson, Hansell and others (excepting
J. H. M. Abbott) have either gone to their
reward or into more profitable occupations;
and, with the exception of Lofting and Pal-
mer, no others of equal calibre are coming
forward to take their places. Readers are
averse to devoting all their bookish leisure
to the adoration of past performers. Give
us this day our daily bread !
“No names, no pack-drill,” is a wise mili-
tary precept which I am about to disregard.
I bought the first copy of Adam and Eve,
hoping to find therein a good Australian
tale. There were two stories and they
were most feeble. Hackneyed, preposterous,
irrational rubbish! I bought almost every
copy of the late and unlamented Punch.
Here, surely, in a paper which “took the
nation into its purview,” and in its format
(foolishly) invited comparison with the
Saturday Evening Post, one would find
really good Australian stuff. In all, not
more than three readable yarns appeared.
The best was “Silvester’s Corner,” by Myra
Morris; even that suffered from the much
too frequent Australian defect of empha-
sising the General Miserableness of Every-
thing. I wrote to Miss Morris expressing
my appreciation—with reservations. She
replied that the quality to which I took
exception was “life.” Well, life may be like
that, but I haven’t noticed it. The most
execrable of the stories, from an Australian
viewpoint, w T ere some which must be de-
scribed as Austramerican hybrids. The scenes
were laid in Tasmania, but the characters
used the affected drawl and the idioms of
the American cowboy. “Lopin’ Along” was
the title of one; it is representative of the
others. They were a deliberate distortion
of Australian life. It was apparent that the
author thought he saw a chance to reach
fame hanging on to the coat-tails of Tom
Mix. Mr. Cronin will remember those
stories.
Against my better judgment I buy occa-
sional copies of the Australian Journal,
just to see if the old rag shows signs of
mending its ways. It doesn’t. I get the
Sydney Mail about twice a month, and,
except for Lofting's stuff, find something to
read in it about twice a year. I have bought
enough “Bookstall”-ors to fill a kerosene
ease and I estimate that the good ones
have cost me about eighteen or nineteen
shillings each. But why continue? To
read locql stories and books is to wonder
whether editors publish them because they
like them, because they think their readers
like them, or because they can’t get any
better? To read the literary criticisms of
our journals, and then turn to the stories
published, is to marvel at such wealth of
insight being wedded to such poverty of per-
formance. Australian fiction, either stories
or novels, has such poor repute that only
diligent seekers like myself investigate it.
The few good things that have been pro-
duced won instant and continued apprecia-
tion. It is absurd, therefore, to charge
readers with lack of sympathy.
I buy The Bulletin as often as it issues.
In it I find the same writers who do puerile
rubbish for other publications turning off
The Bulletin’s special sort of story with
the facility of masters. Little trick
tragedies ; little tales dealing with something
sensational for the sake of the instant effect
gained; or else something deceptively cheery
with a bolt-from-the-blue ending. They are
clever. But their frequency, their mechani-
cal perfection and the fact that other softs
of stories published elsewhere by the same
authors are mostly without merit suggest
that they are fairly easy. They are not
Australian —they derive from De Maupas-
sant and the more dejected of the Russians.
One learns so quickly to anticipate that final
sob; that pistol pop in the last line. Refer-
ring to that type of story, Mr. Cronin speaks
of “the cameo quality of the art it affects.”
We readers (God help us!) are not inter-
ested in art. We would be very interested
in a good, wholesome realistic yarn about
normal Australian people, one preferably
with a chuckle at the end. But it is so
much more difficult to raise a smile than to
cause a gasp of dismay. Good fiction ex-
presses the life and condition and spirit of
the people with whom it concerns itself.
Does the bulk of Australian fiction accom-
plish this in any degree at all?
And now for prices and protection. If
the man who gets' £3O for a “Bookstall”-er
were to get £6O or £6OO, he would write
no better. If, under protection, local jour-
nals could pay £2O or £3O or £4O for a first-
class story, would the majority of those
now writing benefit? This loud cry for pro-
tection against foreign trash, this repeated
reference to trash as if nothing -but trash
is imported, is very irritating. Australian
trash thrives mightily even under foreign
competition, and —accept my assurances—is
paid for as liberally as trash written else-
where. The thing that is smothering Aus-
tralian literary expression is the overwhelm-
ing supply of first-class foreign fiction.
The question of supporting a score or so
of local writers in something like affluence
hardly enters into the question of protec-
tion. The entertainment of a nation, the
enrichment of its life, the fostering of its
corporate spirit, enter into the question
very much. We can afford protection. If
protection caused reading to be twice as
expensive as at present, reading would still
be one of the cheapest benefits we enjoy.
Think—if we had an Australian Kipling, a
Philip Gibbs, a Mark Twain, a Churchill,
a Singmaster, an Emerson Hough! Let
us have protection if you will; but let us
have no more hocus-pocus about “foreign
trash” from scribblers to most of whom
protection would mean literary obliteration.
F. D. DAVISON.
The Linguist
I have started to learn Japanese, It is
a bit late but the old proverb seems t-o be
applicable. Why was I taught Latin and
French at school? I have never met a
Frenchman who could not speak English as
well almost as I could myself, and if ever
I spend more than a week in France it will
probably be because I have missed my boat.
I waded through reams of Caesar, Cicero and
Horace because “Latin is a good mental
exercise.” The doings of dear old Tullius
and his mate Balbus were mildly interest-
ing ; but if these things are “good exercise,”
then is my colloquial Japanese advanced
acrobatics.
A wonderful people, the Japanese. They
must be to have invented and used a lan-
guage in which there are at least three
modes of, speech—one for addressing in-
feriors, a second for equals and a third for
superiors. Not merely long-winded, polite
phrases in lieu of terse colloquialisms, but
three entirely different sets of nouns and
verbs, or conjugations of the same verbs.
Rather a priceless language in which to be
insulting. One would only need to use the
wrong terminals or auxiliaries and stress
them a little in order to turn a compliment
into a deadly insult. The idioms are quaintly
logical when one gets the hang of them, and
the construction of the sentences not very
difficult to understand. The conjugation of
the verbs is elementary, and concerned more
with politeness than the inflections of per-
son, number and case that were the main
features of one’s schoolday Latin and French.
There are no declensions as I knew them.
Wise Japanese! A number of “post-posi-
tions” serve the purpose of the English pre-
positions, conjunctions, etc. An essentially
dramatic, even pantomimic, language, de-
pending largely on expression for the finer
shades of meaning.
My chief trouble is viva-voce practice. A
Japanese “boy” would be a good idea, but
the White Australia policy prevents. I
wonder if I could get another job in the
Bismarcks or Solomons? You cannot beat
a housekeeper for teaching you a language.
They are an amazing people to have got
along all these years with a script as archaic
as Egyptian hieroglyphics and more cum-
bersome to handle. But, then, they do not
appear to have done much business, either
governmental or commercial, until quite re-
cently. And no wonder. There are three
several sets of characters. They use them
all at once, and the unfortunate reader must
sort them out and arrive at the meaning
as best he may. Kan-ji is Chinese in origin,
and appears to have been invented in much
the same way as the Egyptian characters.
It is ideographic. Something roughly re-
sembling a fir-tree was drawn to represent
“a tree,” and the conception extended to
include cognate ideas (as timber, forest,
etc.), with or without the addition of auxil-
iary flourishes to convey wider meanings.
So far logical enough, though somewhat
cumbersome. Then Japan appears to have
retired into splendid isolation, and her school-
men to have made a cult of word-painting.
They elaborated the original ideas right out
of many of the pictures, leaving their unfor-
tunate countrymen to struggle with some
four thousand aggregations of brush-strokes,
most of which bear only remote, if any,
relationship to the basic ideograph or to one
another. Printed Kan-ji is settling into
uniformity, but the hand-written characters
are to a great extent variable according to
the school of the t writer, and their resem-
blances to the printed character are often
remote. The comprehension of this script
alone is an exercise in visual memorising
that puts Latin and Greek verbs and nouns
quite in the shade. I doubt if I shall per-
sist, still
_ The other two systems are sonant; each
sign represents the sound of a syllable. Each
has some 50 signs. Hira-Gana is cursive,
i.e., curly; Kata-hana is angular. Theoreti-
cally, one could write Japanese in any of
the scripts. In practice the Japanese seem
to like their writing as the Yankees do their
drinks, mixed. Marvellous people! Most
of the nouns and verbs are written in Kan-
ji; the inflections are tacked on, and the
verbal small-fry added in Gana or Kana, or
both. And I am trying to learn this extra-
ordinary language from books. I rather
admire my nerve.
I do not see how the Japanese can have
a great literature, as we understand it. The
language seems hardly mobile enough, and
lacks words to describe the more fanciful
journeyings of the human mind. I cannot
imagine the translation into their tongue of
“The Inferno” or even “Pilgrim’s Progress.”
Heroic literature is possible, but not roman-
tic. There are no words to describe love
as the European races know it. Poor Japs!
To them love is either a mere passion or an
exercise in obedience or ancestor worship.
I am not so sure that I wish to read
Japanese, but the Russian is steadily
Bolshevising China, and it behoves me to
do some thinking in Asiatic, rather than in
European, terms. Is it not time our educa-
tionists awoke to the fact that France, Ger-
many and Italy are not Pacific Powers,
while Japan, China and Holland are?
Resolved.... I shall teach my children
Japanese, or Chinese, or Dutch; perhaps
the lot.

The Iliad and Homer
The Iliad is planned. It is, as a composi-
tion, the work of one man and intelligible
only as such. No process or development
will account for its structure; neither strati-
fication, nor accretion, nor purgation. To
call it a traditional book and import analo-
gies from the Higher Criticism of the Hebrew
Scriptures is to beg the question and falsify
the methods of inquiry. To trust any one

PRESIDENT SUSPENDER CO., Ltd., 50 York Street, Sydney
of all the tests applied to it to work with
mechanical exactitude in distinguishing
earliness and lateness of its constituent parts
is to imagine a vain thing. There is only
one way, that of interpretation and analysis
—to discover the plan of its author and to
determine how far the parts both har-
monise and conflict with it. Herein vital
and fundamental principles of art are in-
volved, and the question at times becomes:
“What are the essential characteristics of
epic poetry?”
Goethe, who, in criticism, was generally
an aesthetic pundit, worked out for himself
the formula that the nature of the epic is to
retard the action; and this, like everything
else that Goethe said, lias been solemnly and
piously repeated. It is true, if we consider
the Iliad as a whole. The very centre of
the composition (books 13-15) is “a long
retardation of the action,” a welter of fight,
from which one escapes with a great breath
of relief as the turbid sky is blown clear in
16. But Homer is sw’ift, incredibly swift.
To all time the exposition of the first book
remains matchless: seven lines to announce
the subject—the wrath of Achilles, its con-
sequences, and its occasion ; another 45 bring
all preceding events up to that occasion—
and in that brief space the poet manages to
report three speeches. Economy combined
with full presentation, speed without breath-
lessness.
But that exposition belongs not to the
Iliad and its maker, but to the old wrath of
Achilles and its author, Homer. Iliadic and
Homeric are in conflict. It is interesting to
observe this conflict —due to distension of ail
older framework—in two most important epi-
sodes, the deaths of Hector and Achilles.
When Homer’s Achilles retired to his tent,
disaster promptly befell the Greeks. The
Iliad first lets them win, and then, when the
battle must go against them, defers the
crisis. That again involves delay of the ven-
geance. When Achilles saw one of the
Grecian ships blaze up he knew that the
hour of satisfaction had arrived: the Greeks
would fall suppliant about his knees. But
to that end they must be saved from immi-
nent doom; he despatches his friend to the
rescue, charging him straitly not to venture
too far. We see him anxiously watching the
battle roll away towards Troy. As it is
hurled back and the cry comes to him that
Patroclus is dead, what do we expect of
him? Surely, grief and revenge will eat up
all other feelings; with no thought for his
wounded honor, he hurls himself into the
fray, and with one stroke avenges his friend
and liberates the Greeks from fear.
The plan of the Iliad demanded delay. Its
author required a pause (the reconciliation
in 17) to balance that brought about by the
introduction of the embassy in 9. Achilles
must be kept off the field. He cannot fight,
for he had lent his armor to his friend;
Hector has stripped the corpse, new armor
must be made. Further, when Achilles does
take the field, he must not be permitted to
slay Hector at once. For hitherto he has
done nothing but sulk; the balance of the
poem is destroyed unless he is provided with
feats of derring do to match those attributed
to other Greek champions during his absence.
Hence the last battle opens with bombast
and is distended with episodes, extravagant
though grandiose, like the fight with the river.
The death of Achilles, like the fall of Troy,
lies outside our Iliad, but, like that, is every-
where presupposed and more than once
announced, in one place (18, 96) most
strangely—Thetis tells her son that fate
awaits him directly after Hector. Whether his
own or another’s, the author of our Iliad let
that line pass him because he was under the
spell of an older poem, which he used as far
as it suited him, and in which Achilles fell
in one day with Hector.
The sixth Iliad is famous and the parting
of Hector and Andromache requires no praise
here. And perhaps no attentive reader needs
any prompting to feel that this is their last
meeting. Every word is fraught with the
sense of close-impending doom. Hector knows
that all his valor cannot save his town:
Andromache knows that Achilles has slain all
her kindred and Hector is now her all in all
—it is not Diomed, as the Iliad has it, but
Achilles who rages before that Skaian gate
in which she has met her spouse and through
which he will presently go out into the plain
to meet his fate. That is yet tolerably clear ;
but the author of the Iliad, in adapting the
older poem to his situation, has cunningly
managed to mask the true motive of
Hector’s visit to Troy and its result. He
makes it appear a casual thought on Hector’s
part, being in Troy, to go and look up Paris —
whom in reality he had gone to seek. For,
though in our Iliad and more so in later
fancy, the husband and lover of Helen are
both inferior to their fellows, yet, in older
poetry, the fairest of the fair could only be-
long to the bravest of the brave. The absence
of Paris from the battle was a gi’ievous loss
to his side. And, more important, it was by
his hand that Achilles fell. So, when Hector
goes to his death through the Skaian gate,
he takes the avenger with him; and from
that gate, as his slayer rages behind the flee-
ing Trojans, the fatal arrow will be launched
and the armor of Achilles will ring in the
bloody dust.
The Higher Criticism has had many stupid
adversaries and many dull exponents. Never-
theless, the vast inquiry, which it would be
both vain and useless for any one man to
attempt to pursue into all its ramifications,
has not been futile. We have through it
come to a true appreciation of epic poetry as
poetry. The author of the Iliad is not de-
frauded of one fraction of his due fame, while
to Homer and many a contemporary and
follower of Homer’s we restore the wealth
which the Iliad has garnered into one
treasure-house, and some that it discarded.
CHRIS. BRENNAN.
Self-selected Masterpieces
The cabled news that H. G. Wells is
writing a two- or three-volume novel prob-
ably indicates that he has reached the stage
of selecting his masterpiece, in case posterity
is not equal to the task. He need have no
fears; the nerve and ability of posterity,
in such matters, are both quite adequate, and
pay little regard to the feelings of authors.
The authors, on their part, seem often misled
by considerations which do not appeal to
readers. .
Milton, in preferring “Paradise Regained
to “Paradise Lost,” was probably thinking
of the subject and the theology ; but readers
like the more colorful and varied longer
poem. Wordsworth’s “Excursion” has won
high praise from competent critics, but its
length and abstractness of matter drive
readers to his sonnets and shorter poems.
Browning’s “Ring and the Book” is enough
to frighten almost anyone by its mere length
and repetition, although it is undoubtedly
one of his most characteristic products.
Tennyson’s “Idylls of the King” is much
more popular, through its clearnless and
narrative appeal; but it breaks up too easily
into 12 distinct poems. The labor which
Hardy put into “The Dynasts” seems to
show that he thought it the best he could do.
It is certainly a wonderful creation; with-
out grace or superficial attractiveness, it lives
by sheer strength and consistency. Yet how
many i-eaders has it in comparison with
“Tess”? Dickens had a special liking for
“David Copperfield,” probably because he
put into it much of his own life which he
could not bear to mention in arty other
manner. But his choice is also well grounded
in the harmony of the book, and the com-
parative subdual of his tendency to extremes
in characterisation.
Arnold Bennett has lately put his trilogy
into one volume under the name of “The
Clayhanger Family.” But that does not
make it his best book, an honor which cannot
be separated from “The Old Wives’ Tale.”
There he shows a sureness of touch, sound-
ness of construction, vitality and movement
which he cannot elsewhere rival. Parts of
the Clayhanger story are very fine, but much
of it is dull and lifeless. Galsworthy’s
“Forsyte Saga” makes an imposing book,
with a great cumulative effect; it is beauti-
fully written and much of. it is delightful.
But it lacks variety; the tone is too uniform,
the sardonic note is heard too often ; it is
difficult in reading it to forget the profes-
sional artist behind the scenes. I think
the condensation forced by the dramatic
form will make Galsworthy’s plays live
longer than his novels ; in them, as also in
his short stories, he lets himself go, and
sometimes succeeds in concealing his art.
Shakspeare did not pick over the fruit in
his basket. He simply wrote as well as he
could in the way he liked at the moment, and
thus produced five or six plays, each so fine
and yet so distinct from the others, that they
have all been claimed as the summit of
dramatic writing. That seems a perfectly
satisfactory arrangement.
R. G. HENDERSON.
In the Altogether
The cemetery of the past is full of dead
yesterdays, with here and there a monument,
an effigy or a scroll to mark the passing of
a momentous happening and distinguish it
from the multitude of mounds which cover
the ephemeral and the commonplace. Each
person’s “past” is a private affair, deserving
of private interment (no flowers, by re-
quest), and in the majority of cases so en-
tirely insignificant as to be secure from the
advent of any form of literary resurrection.
But now and then there comes a being who
hankers after the limelight, or one who
carries his complex like a cross, or one so
deeply interested in his doings that he resists
the immortal gravedigger, Time, and em-
balms his escapades in the prose of a book.
Thus does the mortal put on the immortality
of print, and the mummy march forth in
morocco.
Each year the literature of confession
grows larger, as the mask of modesty is
thrown aside; and among the freshest pages
are those of Gertrude Beasley in My First
Thirty Years (Three Mountains Press,
Paris). She has exhumed the corpse of her
past life and, having removed the grave-
clothes, set it upon the model’s throne—
undraped. She has painted a full-length,
life-sized portrait in the altogether.
The writing of autobiography offers large
scope for romance, and many have indulged
in the flattering pastime of dressing up in
front of their own cameras. But Gertrude
Beasley has endeavored to see herself as
others saw her; she has tried to do more—
to show herself as no other has had the
opportunity of seeing, when the blinds have
been drawn and the doors locked. She has
done this bluntly, and with a callousness
which savors of sincerity. But this con-
tinual delving into the inner personality, this
fumbling with the old clothes of desire in
the wardrobes of the subconscious, to bring
to light the workings of a morbid mind, is
simply a form of sublimated exhibitionism
—an offence of taste which in the domain of
literature alone is not punishable by law.
Of living literary exhibitionists perhaps
the most celebrated is George Moore. There
is a rumor current among the more ribald
of his contemporaries that, as a small child,
having fled from his pre-occupied nurse-
maid, he divested himself of all clothing, and
ran about the parks of Dublin; and his de-
tractors say that when he grew to manhood
he commenced to run about his writings in
the same state. A neurotic and a celibate
—hence a literary exhibitionist. For while
autobiographical writing demands a certain
nakedness, literary exhibitionism is an
attempt to arouse a definite emotional re-
sponse. It is a conscious effort on the part
of the narrator who is exposing himself to
achieve the gratification he seeks in his
projected emotions.
The biographical confessions of both Mar-
got Asquith and Frank Harris have all the
qualifications of exhibitionist writings. But
Gertrude Beasley’s book is the more perfect
type. Margot’s portrait is decollete, hence
the storm in the social teacup; but it is
dressed, even if only in literary crepe de
Chine. And Frank Harris’s figure is some-
what becomingly obscured by the brilliance
of the halo with which he has surmounted
it. But there is nothing hiding that stark,
repellent figure of Gertrude Beasley.
Her writing is crude, cold and primitive.
It is unsparing. All the squalor of life
lived next to nature, in Texas, between the
scullery and the stable, is blocked in with
a harsh precision. Drunkenness and paren-
tal depravity are made ghastly by deliberate
contrasts. Even the bed linen seems flecked
with the mire of the sty. But her draughts-
manship is splendid. Every motive is mag-
nified and set down, every desire is dissected,
every emotion analysed. The hard lines of
the portrait are painted mercilessly. Bach
wrinkle is a masterpiece of truth. The body’s
deformity is clearly delineated, and the
mind’s depravity, the cruel conflicts of repres-
sions, are suggested in the livid colors of
corruption. But under it all the true ex-
hibitionist gloats—gloats with morbid adora-
tion upon an indecorous ostentation.
REG. S. ELLERY.
The Cult of the Comics
Whenever I set out for town, the invari-
able last request of my two young hopefuls
is, “Don’t forget to buy us a comic.” And
on my return these gaily-colored papers are
the first things seized by the twain, who
spread the sheets before them and pore over
the doings of their favorite characters by
the hour. Before the youngest could
read the wording she read the pictures, and
afterwards insisted on her brother or her
mother or myself explaining parts that she
w r as doubtful about. It is difficult for their
mother to read the Woman’s Mirror with-
out first acceding to their insistent demands
concerning Blub and Bertie.
Now why should these children’s so-called
“comics” make such an irresistible appeal to
the juvenile mind? At first glance one would
suggest that the attraction lies in the stark
coloring; but uncolored pictures are just as
eagerly read as colored ones. Children from
six to ten years of age live again the myth-
making and myth-believing stage in the his-
tory of the race, and therefore see no incon-
gruity in animals talking and acting like
human beings. I find that the more pictures
of animals behaving as children and adults
there are in these papers the better my two
youngsters like them. So the first appeal
of these “comics” is psychological. Secondly,
the pictured characters are shown doing
things, mostly of a mischievous kind, that
they would like to do themselves if they were
not inhibited by the family, the school and
the habits of the world at large. And then,
when they see the wicked punished, they
rejoice, because, just like young savages,
they always delight to see the other fellow
punished. Contrariwise, they are equally
as pleased when the wicked character —the
villain of the piece—escapes just retribution,
for they have an innate desire to likewise
escape from their little misdeeds. The edi-
tors of these weeklies and the artists and
writers who obey their commands well under-
stand the psychology of the child mind.
But this cult lives longer than the child;
and few of us ever outgrow it. It would
be a poor look-out for authors and actors
and picture-producers if we did. Why do
we read tales of romance? Why do we flock
to ' the theatres and picture-shows ? To be
amused, to be thrilled, to be exalted in spirit
—all these are perhaps good adult reasons.
But deep down we are just like the children
devouring their “comics.” In the novel, at
the theatre, in the moving-picture, we see
actually, or with the mind’s eye, others mak-
ing smart speeches and performing deeds
that we should like to be able to do, but
never can. Like children, we live for a time
in another woi’ld; and, since we are thus
enabled to forget for a time the cares and
sorrow’s of our humdrum life, we are all
the better for these little excursions into
the world of make-believe.
COUNTRY PED.
Novels Worth Reading
This list has been compiled by a committee
nominated by the Associated Booksellers
of Australia and M.L. to serve as a guide
to new fiction of outstanding merit: —
Books of Literary Merit. —Fairy Gold, by Compton
Mackenzie; Two or Three Graces, by Aldous Huxley;
The Private Life of Helen of Troy, by John Erskine;
Rock and Sand, by Naomi Jacob; The Great World,
by “A Gentleman with a Duster.”
Books for Popular Reading. —Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes, by Anita Loos ; The Peacock’s Tail, by Mi’s.
Romilly; My Brave and Gallant Gentleman, by
Robert Watson ; Ernestine Sophie, by Sophia Cleugh ;
A Question of Color, by F. E. Penny; The Ivory
Graves, by Sir Hector Duff; The High Forfeit, by
Basil King; The Cortlandts of Washington Square,
by Janet Fairbank.
A Satchel of Books
Black Magic, by Marjorie Bowen (John Lane).
“In the large room of a house in a certain quiet
city in Flanders, a man was gilding a devil.” There
is the suggestion of a modern society novel in this
opening, but as a matter of dull fact it introduces
to us a central figure in a mediaeval romance in
which witchcraft, magic spells and potions play
a prominent part. It is a new edition of a work
pronounced by its earlier critics to be “one of the
queerest novels published in English.” It is doubt-
ful whether republication with all its youthful sins
thick upon its head was worth while.
Behind the Hills, by A. Clucas (Lothian). In
“the golden land behind the hills” live the fairies
of the bush. At night time they come out to dance,
but by day they sleep inside the flowers. Into this
wonderful world where the bellbirds ring the chimes
and Mrs. Cockatoo White is the wife of the Mayor,
where Prince Sturt Pea is betrothed to a lovely
princess and a whole host of happenings follow in
exciting sequence, little Carol the dreamer is borne
by her bush friends. An attempt, and a creditable
one, to create for Australian children a fairyland
not dependent on the conventional figures of the
old world.
Protection and the Social Problem, by Arthur J.
Penty (Methuen). In a survey covering a- wide
historic field the author endeavors to establish the
position that the only secure basis of international
peace and goodwill is to be found in removing the
cause of friction by making each country as self-
contained and self-supporting as possible. Which,
of course, means Protection. “Indeed,” he declares,
“freetraders have no position at all. For they
have abandoned almost every idea germane to the
freetrade theorybelief in it survives only as a
superstition.” In a closely packed book of many
pages the author proceeds to establish his proposition.
Birds of Australia (Australasian Ornithologists’
Union). The Union has issued a second and revised
edition of “The official checklist of the birds of
Australia,” including an appendix by 11. Wolsten-
holme of scientific names and of notes and pronunci-
ation. The list itself contains the consecutive
number of the species of the bird, its accepted generic
name, with specific and vernacular names, and gives
useful references to colored and other plates. In-
cluded is a useful map indicating type localities.
General readers will find much of interest, and
possibly material for discussion, in the vernacular
list. Some indefinite names have been replaced by
others more appropriate, and for clumsy and in-
elegant ones others more suitable or euphonious
have been substituted. Some of the. new baptisms
should cause rejoicing in birdland. The “White-
shouldered Caterpillar-eater,” to be known in future as
the “White-winged Triller,” will surely preen him-
self.

IN the brave days of old, bold
knights were retained to protect
the castles of their lords from the
armed forces of wandering robbers.
To-day civilisation requires no
romantic knight-at-arms, but our
modern castles still need protection
from armed forces —the forces of
Rust and Corrosion. Make your
protector “Ferrodor Elastic Paint
—made with a high ideal of service.
Ferrodour Elastic Paint” is composed of a flaky, indestructible
peroxide of iron in a linseed-oil base of elastic qualities. The flaky formation
of the pigment makes a strong scaly armor that, embedded in its base, is long-
lasting and resistant. Because the “Ferrodor” pigment cannot take up oxygen,
it is unaffected by damp, heat or cold, by salt air, mining fumes or even strong
acids, it is indestructible and unchangeable. By reason of its elastic qualities,
climatic changes cannot affect this perfect paint. It does not lose its appearance,
does not split, chip or crack, and lasts years longer than any other paint on
the market. This big statement can be proved to the hilt. Some of Australia s
leading firms have proved and are proving it now. You will prove it yourself
some day—why not now? Paint now for perfect protection.

A PACKARD SINGLE-SIX SEVEN-PASSENGER TOURING CAR IS ILLUSTRATED
At Home in Any Environment
THE Packard is at home in any surroundings. On the great high-
ways or in the city streets it well reflects its owner’s taste and
judgment. Packard supremacy has won and held international re-
cognition for more than a generation. In town or country, at any
time, the Packard owner knows the constant satisfaction which comes
with the possession of things universally approved.
Packard Six owners know that these long-lived, fine cars provide
as desirable and enjoyable transportation after the first 20,000 miles
as before. And there lies the secret of owning a Packard. You want
to keep it longer than cars of lower cost and when you do, you
enjoy Packard ownership at a cost no greater than you pay in the
long run for cars of shorter life and far less distinction. For the man
who desires to own a fine car at a moderate outlay there can be
nothing better than a Packard.

Most people think of the carpet
sweeper as a box, four wheels and a
brush but there is a decided differ-
ence in sweepers.
For 49 years Bissell Carpet Sweepers
have by sheer merit alone maintained
their international reputation for su-
perior mechanical construction and
handy, quiet, thorough sweeping. Only
a tremendous production yearly in the
world’s largest carpet sweeper works
permits its quality at the price.
Millions of users have recognized
Bissell’s marked superiority. No other

the famous “Cyco” ball bearings, one
set for each wheel where they do the
most good, make the sweeper easier
running, give greater brush propelling
power and automatically take up wear.

Bewitched.
Last night upon a laurel-tree
In my suburban street,
Wliat time the full moon soared above,
A shepherd-bird sang sweet.
To ears that heard not, folk that slept
From toil and care' withdrawn,
All blithe, all happily he sang
From fall of night to dawn.
While, white and round, the full moon moved
Her broad sky-road along,
All silver grew the laurel’s leaves,
All sweet with light and song.
Bewitched by song my mind sped far
From city streets and slums
To distant hills in moonlight steeped,
And drooping Barrier . ins.
Kind folk beloved I saw again,
Kind folk beloved I heard,
And for the vision that it brought
I thanked a sheplierd-bird.

Balloons.
Dark amber as the centuries-liidden gum
That lit the neck of some brown courtesan,
Or scarlet as a painted pierrette’s lips
That yet are warm and young to hold a
man ;
Between the shallow steps and harbor blue.
With one black cypress rigid in the breeze.
Bubbles of laughter loosed by fantasy,
To write along the sky their vanities —
The many-hued balloons of carnival,
Flirting across the night their parrot
wings;
The swelling purples of the wine-filled grape,
The green of almond-leaves in Eastern
springs!
To-night, my dear, whirl with the whirling
dance %• v
Of satin pierrots and of golden moons;
To-morrow, dreaming ’neath our cypress-tree,
We may not care for kisses or balloons!

A breeze came vaulting o’er my sill
This morning while dawn still was grey;
Its touch, which set my veins athrill,
Awoke me to a feeling gay ;
And when the sun night’s vapors kissed
It flung a gold-dust on their mist.
When forth I went with heart a-bound,
The scent of freesias brought delight;
And right and left new flowers I found,
Born, so it seemed, within the night.
I thought dawn sang in music gay;
“The Spring is coming down the way.”
The earth was full of whispers soft.
I heard the sap in grasses sing.
And felt as one whose hat is doffed
To free the brow for garlanding,
As meeter for that carnival
When Spring’s young joyance conquers all.
Though Winter yet may stay awhile,
The echo of gay feet afar
Brings all the gladdened earth a smile
Its worst of anger cannot mar;
My heart tunes to that chorus gay:
“The Spring is coming down the way.”

I cannot quell my gladness. I have seen
To-day the first bright sprig of southern
gold
Gleaming amidst the sober brown and - green
Of trees. It seemed so jaunty, gay and
bold—
A naughty schoolboy playing in the porch
Of an austere cold church that yesterday
Knew not the laugh and light and lilt of
play.
Ah, quickly shall that gay and golden torch
Spread the bright fire among the forest
aisles,
Turning the skeleton of yester-year
Into a decent grave, and spreading smiles
Over the land, and faith, and hope and cheer!

A Magpie.
A magpie at the dawn!
He sings ecstatic from a windy tree,
The chilly dark around, the dewy lawn,
The drooping leaves and petals brown with
frost
Below. The lovely liquid melody
Flows through the darkness like a crystal
stream
Of music, and is lost
Among the silent hills. A silver gleam
Within the east appears. The greying sky
Seems not so desolate,
The bitter wind
A little less unkind
For that pure bird-song high
And sweet. Did ever any challenge fate
So bravely? Clarion clear the song he sings.
Across the dark the raptured music rings,
And echoes on until the paling star
Low in the west above the amethyst
Of distance surely hears it from afar—
Rich melody that thrills
The gloomy morn and speeds the rising mist
That floats across the rim of purple hills.
A magpie at the dawn,
Who sings alone the windy trees among
And spills the treasure of his golden tongue
Upon the dewy lawn!
How brave the joyous spirit that can sing
So blithely thus before the sunrise. Hark!
The careless songster of the glossy wing
With mellow cadence floods the dreary dark!
O sweet courageous singer of the grey,
Awaiting undismayed the veiled unknown,
Thus may I greet to-day and every day!

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1926.
YES-YES.
Bryce says in liis “American Common-
wealth” that “the powers vested in each State
are all of them original and inherent powers,
which belonged to the State before it entered
the Union; hence they are prima facie un-
limited.” On the other hand, “the powers
granted to the National Government are dele-
gated powers, enumerated in and defined by
the instrument which has created the Union.”
It follows that, “if a question arises as to
any particular power, it is presumed to be
enjoyed by the State, unless it can be shown
to have been taken away bv the Federal
Constitution”; as regards the National Gov-
ernment, but not the State, “proof must be
given that the power was positively granted—
if not granted it is not possessed.” The U.S.
Constitution, Bryce also points out, has
divided up authority in such a way as to
leave a residuum of powers neither granted
to the Union nor continued to the States, but
reserved to the people, who can put them in
force by amending Urn Constitution,” These
remarks are as true of Australia as they are
of America, the principal features of whose
Federal system we have copied. In both
countries there are times when an increase
of Federal powers becomes necessary. Such
a situation has arisen in Australia to-day.
The party in office went before the electors
nine months ago, and received a very decided
mandate to exhaust all legitimate means of
ending the miserable industrial warfare
which is stifling the development of the coun-
try and dividing a perilously-situated nation
into two camps. It now tells its masters
that it has done a little towards that
end, but, because its bands are tied, not
nearly enough. It wants to go on, but the
Constitution, as interpreted by the High
Court, forbids. Its industrial powers are
limited to the passing of laws relating to
Commonwealth Government employees and
methods of arbitration which are exasperat-
ingly tedious and unsatisfactory. The Gov-
ernment seeks authority for the removal of
these impediments to peace and the setting
up of conditions that would assist to bring
it about. It is for the people to say whether
this authority should or should not be
granted, for “all authority flows from the
people.”
* * * *
The powers asked for are all, or nearly
all, concurrent powers—that is, powers exer-
cisable by both ,Common wealth and State.
There are some concurrent powers which
admit of Commonwealth and State Parlia-
ments passing constitutionally-sound laws
on the same subject (taxation of incomes,
for instance), the provisions being valid and
binding on the citizen, however they may
differ. There are others of such a nature that
State legislation only takes effect where it
does not conflict with Federal legislation, or
where, as in the domain of marriage and
divorce, no Federal legislation exists. Where
there is conflict Federal law prevails over
State law, and so do awards of the Federal
Arbitration Court, as the High Court de-
cided in the 44-liour week case. The indus-
trial powers for which the Bruce Govern-
ment is appealing belong to this category.
Chief among them is the power to make laws
respecting “conciliation and arbitration for
the prevention and settlement of industrial
disputes” without the restriction imposed by
the words “extending beyond the limits of
any one State.” Those eight words, as
Scullin, M.H.R., who ranks high among
Labor politicians, has pointed out, have cost
federated unions the best part of a million
sterling in litigation as to whether their cases
could lawfully be heard by the Arbitration
Court; and that is only one of the conse-
quences. The clause has hampered the National
Parliament in ways undreamt of by the fram-
ers of the Constitution ; deprived it of pow-
ers which every other national authority
possesses; prevented it establishing wages
boards and the like; obliged unions with
grievances in one State to manufacture dis-
putes in others; compelled them to make
every individual employer a defendant ( the
number in one case ran to 10,000), for those
omitted are not liable; favored the bad em-
ployers who contrived to evade service and
penalised the decent. For good or ill Austra-
lia is committed to the arbitration system;
it cannot retrace its steps. But its arbi-
tration system, to which 330,000 members of
federated unions now look for the adjust-
ment of their relations with their employers,
will never be what it should be —inexpensive,
expeditious and effective—nor will the Com-
monwealth Parliament be able to pass
adequate industrial legislation except as re-
gards the 25,000 Commonwealth employees,
until those eight words —now part of Section
51, paragraph xxxv.—are struck out.
* * * *
Complementary to (he conciliation and
arbitration provision, without the present
tragic restriction, are the following para-
graphs, which will be included in Section 51
if the people approve
Establishing authorities with such powers as the
Parliament confers on them with respect to the
regulation and determination of terms and conditions
of industrial employment and of rights and duties
of employers and employees with respect to industrial
matters and things.
Investing State authorities with any powers which
the Parliament has vested or has power to vest in
any authority established by the Commonwealth.
These proposals are objected to by those who
would delight to see Federal as well as State
politicians fixing wages and hours of labor
for the sake of votes; and they are necessary
because of that danger. They offer a safeguard
against corrupt and demoralising practices
and excessive centralisation. They provide
ways and means of referring local disputes to
local tribunals, of getting hours of labor
determined on definite principles after im-
partial inquiry, of reconciling Federal and
State awards and so making it useless to
rush from one court to another, of bringing
order out of the chaos caused by State poli-
ticians through monkeying with the Com-
monwealth tariff. Necessary also are the
legislative powers which are asked for in
the following terms :
Corporations including—
(a) The creation, regulation, control and dissolu-
tion of corporations; (b) the regulation, control and
dissolution of corporations formed under the law of a
State; and (c) the regulation and control of foreign
corporations.
Trusts and combinations (whether composed of
individuals or corporations or both) in restraint of
trade, trade-unions, _ and associations of employers
or of employees for industrial purposes, including the
formation, regulation, control and dissolution thereof.
The High Court has declared, in a series of
judgments, that the Commonwealth cannot
pass a uniform company law or any com-
pany law that would protect investors and
employees against fraud (and fraud is all
too frequent under existing conditions) ; that
it cannot legislatively control such aggrega-
tions of capital as the Vacuum Oil Co. or
the International Harvester Co.; cannot pun-
ish acts in restraint of trade; cannot pro-
vide against bosses of federated unions call-
ing out their members without taking a
ballot or squandering the funds on “the Revo-
lution.” The national authority in every
other English-speaking country has these
powers. Our national authority will be con-
temptibly weak until it is placed in the same
position.
* * * #
The foregoing proposals have been in-
cluded m one bill, and the electors will have
to vote Yes or No to the lot. It would be
better if there were separate bills and sepa-
rale questions; better also if a pamphlet
containing arguments for and against the
alterations had been posted to each elector,
as in previous years; but that cannot be
helped now. In a second measure the Gov-
ernment seeks authority for “protecting the
interests of the public in case of actual or
probable interruption of any essential ser-
vice.” Here again it is only asking for a
power that every other national Government
possesses. The need for this power has been
shown, not only by the periodical coal stop-
page, but by divers lawless proceedings
which self-respecting citizens cannot recall
without a feeling of humiliation —vile plans
to “darken the streets of Melbourne and Syd-
ney” that criminals might rob and rape and
murder by way of assisting strikers; wicked
holdups of the Commonwealth mails in
Queensland, of S’African Government
steamers in Westralia. of company-owned
ships in a score of ports; wanton destruction
of property, mostly the produce of settlers
who could ill afford to lose it; murderous
attacks on policemen and private individuals.
These pranks were connived at by chicken-
hearted Labor Governments, the national
authority being powerless. If matters are
not better ordered, and if connivance becomes
a habit, Australia will wake up some morn-
ing and find that the races have been post-
poned on account of the Revolution. The
Bulletin recommends all good Australians
to vote Yes —Yes. If Bkuce or any subse-
quent Prime Minister makes improper use
of these legislative powers, in the event of
their being granted, he can be dealt with.
Should the necessity arise, the powers may
even be withdrawn. For what the people
give they can take away.
THE WEALTH OF WESTRALIA.
The Federal Treasurer made a call on
Wes trail a recently to urge that locality
to vote “Yes” at the referendum, but,
to judge by newspaper reports, he found
it little inclined to consider matters
of all-Australian importance. Its lead-
ing, or at least its most audible, citi-
zens were brooding over the alleged un-
paralleled local wrongs. The prominent men
of other States may have a wider outlook,
but those who are most heard of from out
Perth way seem to fall naturally into two
categories. One talks of leaving the Com-
monwealth, the idea being that, outside the
tariff, there would be facilities for, and
profit in, the purchase of foreign nigger
wares instead of Australian white 'goods.
The other is willing that Westralia should
remain in the Commonwealth as a favor,
but holds that it should be liberally paid
for doing so. (The Duchess of Plaza-Toro
was also present at the feast for a con-
sideration.) Nothing is ever said of benefits
received iu the past, yet all through the
Commonwealth’s history the Big State has
contrived to collect more, and generally a
great deal more, per capita than the average.
The situation, as Treasurer Earle Page
found it, was thus reported:—
Members from three political parties and represen-
tatives from all parts of the State presented to the
Federal Treasurer a request for the payment of a
bonus upon gold produced in Westralia. " The Presi-
dent of the Legislative Council (Mr. J. W, Kiewan)
said the cost of producing gold had been rising higher
and higher. The Federal Government was simply
asked to grant the same remedy to gold-mining as was
given to all other industries in Australia. Any relief
must be given immediately, for the industry ' was in
a parlous state.... In a few'months, under the
present conditions, it would be dehd.
And it may be that President Ktrwan and
his friends “from all parts of the State” have
worked up the sense of injury to such a
point that they really believe “all other in-
dustries,” including all the mines in all the
other States, have Federal bonuses, and only
their ewe sheep is out in the cold.
* * * , A .
There are in the Commonwealth six gold-
mining communities with a similar claim,
or a similar lack of claim, for Federal
doles—those of N. S. . Wales, Victoria,
Queensland, S. Australia. Westralia and
Tasmania. The six gold industries are
all in a “parlous” condition, and are all
expected by pessimists to be dead any day.
Other people nourish Hope, and if at times
they have nothing to give the lady they let.
her fast a while for the good of her figure.
The gold industry which seems nearest to
extinction, and most in need of a promptly-
thrown life-line, is that of S. Australia. The
most robust survivor is Westralia’s. Each
one reached a definite summit of production
and then began to decline. In the cases of
Victoria, Queensland and Westralia, the sink-
age, once started, was continuous, like a
wasting sickness. In other States the down-
ward progress was broken by partial and
insufficient revivals. The causes were much
the same. Gold gives out. It tends to
become scarcer at depth preparatory to giving
out, and, on the other side of the account,
costs tend to increase automatically with
depth. Westralia was and is the only mem-
ber of the family to make the decline in its
output a grievance against its neighbors, and
to insist that it should be supplied with a
fresh goldfield in the common Treasury.
* * * **
The decline in Westralia’s output has been
in progress for 22 years. It is customary
in Perth and Kalgoorlie to charge much of
the trouble to the commandeering of gold for
a brief period during the war at pre-war
price, and to demand large compensation;
but the loss, such as it was, fell more or
less on all the States. Also the exhaustion
of the deposits began 11 years before the war.
before commandeering was thought of, and
before the late extraordinary rise in wages.
And the biggest part of the decline was in
the first 11 years (1904-14 inclusive), «ot
in the second 11 years (1915-25 inclu-
sive). Victoria’s gold output fell more dis-
astrously in the 22 years after Bendigo and
other of Nature’s treasuries had passed their
prime, as these figures show:—
Highest Gold Output axd Progkess op Decline.
Victoria. Westralia.
Best year’s output .. .. £12,214,976 £8,770,719
Fall in 11 years .. .. £6,209,192 £3,633,366
Fall in next 11 years .. 2,973,624 3,365,932
Fall in 22 years .. .. £9,182,816 £6,899,298
Output in 22nd year .. £3,032,160 £1,871,421
Victoria’s downfall was the suddenest and
the greatest, and after the first 22 years of
decline the return kept on dropping till in
1925 the figure stood at £200,901. The out-
put of every other State proceeded the same
way, because in tlic absence of new finds it
is in the nature of things that they should.
All the crowd save one took the ageing of
the perishable industry as a matter of course
—even Queensland, which is active in pur-
suit of the wily subsidy at times. The West-
ralian demand for a Federal subsidy is the
more hopeless because of the obvious illegal-
ity of subsidising one State and not all,
and the obvious impossibility of pensioning
one State’s principal mineral without raising
demands on behalf of other minerals which
are also deserving cases.
* * * *
Westralia has been this country's second-
best producer of gold—behind Victoria, yet
a good distance ahead of Queensland. But
it doesn’t look a better subject than the aver-
age on which to try costly and heroic devices
for the resuscitation of the apparently
drowned. Four-sevenths of its total yield
came from the Golden Mile at Ivalgoorlie-
Boulder. During the last year for which
figures are available more than four-fifths
of the yield came from that one patch, and
even it begins to present the worn aspect of
Bendigo or Walhalla or Charters Towers,
though it doesn’t yet approach the desola-
tion of Cobar. Practically all the rest of the
output of 40 years came from six fields,
none of which showed the Mile’s staying
qualities. Though the official record men-
tions 90 dividend-paying mines, nearly one-
fourth of the dividends came from a single
show, and much more than half came from
four shows. Only two of the five remained
on the paying list in 1923. Westralia was
always a patchy goldfield, or, rather, a gold-
field of one supreme patch. New finds are
slow to turn up, which is a common experi-
ence,_ and there is nothing more in the local
conditions than in those of some other States
to suggest that a pension system would make
the old holes blossom like the rose. Still,
there is no reason, legal or otherwise, why
the State should not try the pension experi-
ment at its own cost. A subsidy of 10s. per
ounce on present production would cost less
than £250,000 per annum, and Westralia
has a huge revenue for its population. Un-
fortunately the early company-floaters, being
greedy boomsters rather than miners, habitu-
ally rushed their properties on to the British
and French markets or on those of the East-
ern States. A return issued about 1914 said
that 86 per cent, of Westralian mining secu-
rities were held altogether outside Austral-
asia, while less than 3 per cent, of Victorian
mining stock was foreign-owned. Wherefore,
if _ Westralian mining profits were seriously
blighted, as alleged, by the temporary fixing
of gold prices during the war, only an in-
finitesimal amount of the loss fell on the
community which is making all the row.
Even if a pension of all Australia’s money
could make the Westralian mines pay again,
the buying of profits for aliens and absentees
isn't much of a business. Westralia would
profit, of course, by the distribution of wages,
but there are better ways of making wages.
* * * *
The Statistician at Perth published a re-
turn for 1923 showing the production of the
Big State’s principal industries, and his
figures were these :
Agricultural . . . . £7,537,964
Pastoral . . .. 6,276,049
Manufacturing.. .. 4,720.637
Forests and Fish .. 2,256,237
Goldmining' .. .. 2,143,028
Dairy and sundries .. 1,241,422
Other mining . . 514,922
To which might be added :
Borrowing . . . . 4,099,021
There is nothing to show why a place so
situated should be driven to despair over the
decline of its gold output, especially as manu-
factures have progressed wonderfully since
1923. Westralia has plenty of other re-
sources. But there is a drillky dazzle about
gold-mining which doesn’t belong to perma-
nent industries. The community has been
on the dazzle and the razzle for exactly
49 years. It is sadly in need of a few real
friends wdio will take it by the shoulder and
wake it with a brisk shake.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Can Bruce Win?
Amending the Federal Constitution is a
difficult business. Section 128 provides that
the measure specifying the alteration desired
"must be passed by an absolute majority of
each House of the Parliament,” and “shall.'’
between two and six months thereafter, “be
submitted in each State to the electors quali-
fied to vote for the election of members of
the House of Representatives.” Or the thing
may” be thus submitted if passed by one
House (the other dissenting) and passed
again—in each instance by an absolute
majority—after three months. But in either
case it must be approved by (1) “a majority
of all the electors voting,” and (2) “a majo-
rity of the electors in a majority of the
States,” or out it goes. The Bruce-Page
Government may conceivably secure a con-
siderable majority of votes for the proposals
to be dealt with on Saturday and yet fail be-
cause they are defeated in three States. Pre-
vious Governments which put similar ques-
tions to the people did not succeed in getting
a majority of votes or carrying a majority of
States. In 1911 Andrew Fisher’s Labor
Administration asked for much the same
powers over industrial “matters,” companies
and trusts as the Bruce-Pages are now
seeking, together with unlimited powers over
trade and commerce and authority to nation-
alise monopolies, which the present Govern-
ment does not seek. The trade-and-eommercc,
companies, trusts and industrial clauses were
lumped in one hill, called Legislative Powers
(there was a separate Monopolies measure),
on which the electors had to vote Yes or No.
Only one State (Westralia) said Yes, the
figures being:—
For. Against.
N. S. Wales .. .. 135,968 240,605
Victoria 170.288 270,390
Queensland .. .. 69,562 89.420
S. Australia .. .. 50,358 81,904
Westralia .. .. 33,043 27,185
Tasmania .. .. 24,147 33,200
Totals 483,356 742,704
That referendum took place in the off sea-
son, and little more than half the electors
turned up. Deciding they would fare better
if they changed their tactics and made a
party matter of it.. Fistier and Hughes split


Legislative Powers into five bills (Monopo-
lies need not be considered) and submitted
them on election-day, 1913. The result was
that Government and referendum proposals
were alike defeated, the former by one seat
and the latter by an equivalent number of
votes. Westralia, Queensland and South
Alls., being the States in which Labor was
strongest, registered Yes majorities, the vot-
ing on Industrial Matters being as follows:
For. Against.
N. S. Wales .. .. 318,622 361,044
Victoria . . .. .. 297,892 309,804
Queensland .. .. 147,171 123.554
S. Australia .. .. 96.626 91,361
Westralia . . . . 66,451 59,612
Tasmania .. 34,839 42,236
Totals 961,601 987,611
There was another reference to the people at
the 1919 election, the Hughes Nationalist
Government being then in power. Though
the proposals were, in substance, the same
as in 1911 and 1913, the new feature of a
time limit was introduced —the amendments,
if carried, were to lapse at the end of three
years if a Constitutional Convention were sum-
moned in the meantime, and at the end of
seven years if no convention were sum-
moned. On this occasion Victoria and South
Aus. reversed their previous votes remark-
ably, but the general result was the same as
in 1913
For. Against.
N. S. Wales .. .. 259,751 390,450
Victoria 369,210 201,869
Queensland ~ . . 175,225 130,299
S. Australia .. .. 40,520 119,789
Westralia .. . . 48,142 44,892
Tasmania .. .. 18,509 36,861
Totals .. .. 911,357 924,160
What will happen on September 4 Heaven
only knows. The parties are divided as
never before, and compulsory voting will
obtain for the first time at a Federal refer-
endum. New circumstances have arisen;
new currents of feeling are swaying electors.
However, past votes, though freakishly in-
consistent in the instances pointed out, can-
not altogether be ignored, and it is hard to
believe that South Aus., in which the Noes
were 3 to 1 seven years ago, will be Aye this
time. The situation in Queensland and Vic-
toria is much more favorable to the Ayes (if
not so favorable in Victoria as it was in
1919), and though State Righters and seces-
sionists are busy in Westralia, that State
may be reasonably expected to run true to
form. Furthermore, the widespread discon-
tent with the proceedings of the Langs,
Badi.ys and McTiernans will certainly
make itself felt in N. S. Wales, hitherto the
No stronghold. A general stirv'oy suggests
that Bruce has a good chance of getting a
majority of votes and not so good a chance
of carrying a majority of States. N. S.
Wales will be the pivotal province in the
@ne case; the Speck, very likely, in the other.
■
Frenzied Jimmy.
Ex-Premier Jimmy Mitchell, doing the
ungracious host at the civic reception given
to the Federal Treasurer at Perth, said that
what Westralia wanted was “freedom and
sovereignty” :
They ate food and wore clothes made by the
people of the East,, and paid too much for these
things. They did not want charity but justice. On
manufactured goods imported from eastern Australia
the State was paying £2,000.000 more than it need
if good s were admitted from, oversea free of duly.
Evidently Jimmy Mitchell, in his blind
rage, would wipe out the preference to Brit-
ish goods, to Australian goods, to Westralian
goods and to white goods as against cheap-
labor colored products, and would even, if
his State secured “freedom and sovereignty,”
wipe put its customs and excise revenue. All
these are summed up in his shriek that goods
should be “admitted from oversea free of
duty.” The next thing to be wiped out
would be Westralia’s very high-wage fac-
tories, for if they find a difficulty, as is alleged,
in competing with other high-wage factories
in the Eastern States, they wouldn’t last
many minutes in competition with Continen-
tal Europe, India and Japan. Westralia’s
protected factories may be rather rudimen-
tary as yet; still they are growing. The
wages they paid in 1924-25 were twice the
amount of the gold output. The net value
produced (£6,542,298) wasn’t so far behind
the gross value of the gold produced in Wcst-
ralia’s very best year (£8,770,719), and the
number of factory-bands employed (21,754)
were a few more than those officially re-
turned as engaged in Westralian gold-mining
at the top of the boom. So even if manu-
facturing is a sober business, devoid of booms
and bulls and bears and salted claims, it
shouldn't be thrown to the wolves of cheap-
labor competition by the frenzied Jimmies
of politics. And if the time comes when
goods are “admitted from oversea free of
duty,” even the farmer may get a shock. It
may seein a crazy circumstance, but among
Hie Westralian imports in a recent year were
bacon and hams from England. China and
the U.S., also flour from England, India
and the U.S. With the duties taken off,
imports of the sort might become habitual,
which would be nasty. Gold is a fine thing
to attract population, but it takes a very
different class of industry to keep population.

The Smalpage T.B. Cure.
“Pons” : It is but disguising bitter aloes with
honey to say that nobody trusts Dr. Smal-
page’,s method of treating pulmonary tuber-
culosis but himself. The preparations are
not just useless —they have a knack of mak-
ing sick people sicker. A maddening rash
often follows the injections, for one thing,
and general prostration and fever are un-
comfortably common. Smalpage’s failure is
only a further addition to a lengthy list.
Some day a cure for tuberculosis will be
found : and most probably it will be a com-
plex drug, curative for tuberculosis only, as
“606" is foj syphilis; it will consist of a
chain of delicately-balanced molecules linked
together in a laboratory by some genius like
EhPvLICH. In the meantime, every nostrum
in the pharmacopoeia, and even gold itself,
has been tried. The latter metal, worked at
by the Danish investigator Moellgap.d, has
been the death of more consumptives than
one. by the way. The more the remedies
applied to a disease, the less, one can be sure,
is known of the effective treatment of that
disease. Coal-tar, creosote, calcium, the hypo-
phosphites mid mercury have all been used
for tuberculosis and cast aside. Cod-liver
oil, that old sheet-anchor in consumption,
was once thought to be of value because ot
its large content of fatty acids, most abun-
dant in the light-brown variety of the on.
The doctor of to-day believes that the oil s
worth lies in its vitamines, and in these the
light-brown oil is poorest. The German
Koch was hailed as a saviour when he in-
troduced tuberculin in 1890; but tuberculin
(it can be bought in scores of forms) has a
poor market to-day. And not one first-class
sanatorium in England uses the stuff. Up
to date we know of only one safe way to
deal with a consumptive: get him early, and
send him to a good sanatorium. It is a
question of hygiene and discipline, that s all.
But there are not nearly enough good sana-
toria in Australia to go round. To know, as
we do know, that some of these institutions
are still run on the bad old “ward” system,
under which patients can squat together after
a meal of stodgy and badly-cooked food and
discuss their symptoms as they spit into
the fire; to know that a man may wake m
the chill dawn to find that his neighbor
will not awaken again, and nobody else a
penny the wiser—well, it all makes me rather
wonder whether v.e might not send the hat
round for another £IOO,OOO after the cancer
problem has been settled.

The Living; Wage.
Foe several days now an earnest band of
inquirers has been meeting solemnly in Sydney
to wrangle about an abstraction called the
living wage. The quarrel has been entered
upon before in various countries, and whole
acres of paper have been consumed in the
printing of reports. The problem that has to
lie solved looks simple. It might be set out
in a school examination-paper something like
this :
If a man has a large wife and 8§ small children,
lias absolutely no vices and leads the sort of life
that the average Royal Commission would think it
necessary to approve of (if it could agree on that or
any other subject), and if the price of everything
that man might want to buy if constituted as above
specified were fixed and constant and the quality
ditto, how much money would it be a fair thing to
give him each week to buy the things the Com-
mission thinks he ought to buy?
It is possible to evolve an answer to such
a question. In fact, it has been done. But
the sort of people who expect to reach abso-
lute truth by such methods must be curiously
simple-minded. Probably they cling to the
belief, cherished by most folk _ without
mathematical training, that a definite arith-
metical quantity must be produced as the
solution of any problem that can be re-
duced to arithmetical terms. To such folk
the discovery that the answer may come out
in such things as “surds” —-indefinable quanti-
ties which can never be more than approxi-
mations though you work on them for ever-
comes as a sort of blasphemy against the
eternal verities. Actually, such a result is
always to be' expected when the terms of
a problem arc conditional and variable ; and
the living-wage investigators are up against
the additional difficulty that their result,
when they arrive at it. becomes, as soon as it
is applied, a factor in the conditions, and
upsets the whole apple-cart. As a matter
of eoinmonsense, it is a lot more important
to find out how much an industry can afford
to pay in wages than to fix some arbitrary
standard as the wages it ought to pay. In all
industries the amount of wages that can
be paid is conditioned by the amount of work
given in return, but the idea of fixing stan-
dards of work before defining standards of
wages doesn't seem to have occurred to any-
one in political circles. Probably anyone on
the Labor side who admitted having even
dreamt of something so revolutionary would
have reason to wish he had never been born,
and the other side believes it isn't practical
politics to do anything more than protest
against the continual flow of wages and ebb
of hours. The liabit of building a living stan-
dard on what is wanted rather than on what
can be afforded is a well-known human weak-
ness and is not confined to Australia. But
there is no country so favorably situated for
the indulgence of such a policy as this is,
for there is no country—-not even France in
her most reckless moments of victory—so
prone to settling its obligations with lOU’s. A
high standard of living is a good thing for
a nation; nothing better. But to base it
on anything save a high standard of work-
ing and earning is to try to lift one s selt
by one’s own bootlaces.

Wire and Weeping.
Exuding a sense of injury at every pore, the
Primary Producers’ Union of Victoria filled
a long newspaper column with its formal,
official protest against the increased duties
on “iron and steel, wire fencing and net-
ting.” That the primary producers are
wronged goes without saying, for they
always arc, in the vocabulary of the import-
ing clan which organises or assists with
the weep when anything gets in the way
of Foreign-trade. Perhaps they are damaged
a little more than usual this time. Among
the specific woes it is alleged that there is
an atmosphere of unreality about the pre-
ference granted to British goods, which is
rather hard to follow. The amended bit
of tariff covers 14 items, and under the
wire-netting one it is provided that the
British article will come in free, which seems
as cheap as can be expected, while that
of the undesirable alien will pay £lO per
ton. Other preferences are also substantial,
but the P. P. Union alleges that they
won’t last, or that they are going to be
nullified bv dodgy regulations, and it mar-
vels that Prime Minister Bruce can go to
England with the cloak of hypocrisy on his
back, a lying spirit in his mouth and a
chimera in each pocket, and look the tombs
of his ancestors in the face. Then the
Union complains as bitterly about Bruce’s
allusions to the great increase of German
competition as if lie had started another
war; but the importing interests always had
a tenderness towards Huns. Its own re-
marks about the alleged machinations of
the Broken Hill Prop. Co., which manu-
factures wire and many other things at New-
castle (N.S.W.), show no- tenderness .at all;,
but. then, the B. 11. Prop, works in Aus-
tralia. with well-paid Australian labor, which
may make all the difference. The most re-
markable part of the story, though, is that
the monopolistic B. H. Prop, is stated
to have reduced the price of black wire
five times (from £l7 to £l3 3s. 6d. per ton)
and galvanised wire five times (from £l9 to
£ls 7s. 3d. per ton) between February, 1924,
and June, 1925. That seems fairly good for
a bloated monopoly. With all, however, it
is alleged that the cost of wire-netting to
the consumer has remained absolutely
stationary. This is blamed either on the men
who make the wire into netting or the
dealers who sell the finished product, or
both. In the circumstances it seems re-
markable that the Union doesn’t think of
acquiring a commanding interest in some
wire-netting factories, or starting a co-opera-
tive distributing agency, and taking advan-
tage of the cheapened raw material that
way. The agency wouldn’t need to be a
huge affair with a capital of nearly
£6,000,000 like the wholesale co-op. society
of the little speck called Scotland. Some-
thing one-liundredth part the size should do.
Of course, it may be that the craving is not
so much for cheap netting as for cheap im-
ported netting, so that the very secondary
importer may make a bit out of it on its
way to the primary producer. In that
case co-operative devices are not wanted.

The North Wants “Actions, not Words.”
In the course of his referendum campaign
the Prime Minister foregathered with the
Constitutional Club at Brisbane, and spoke
to it with unusual but not excessive earnest-
ness on the dangers of Unpopulated Aus-
tralia
Other nations were vitally interested as to how
the Commonwealth intended to develop and utilise
its vast resources. Some of them felt that if Aus-
tralians could not do the job properly they would
be justified in coming in and doing it...;. In a few
weeks the League of Nations would. meet to discuss
several questions affecting Australia. How many
people knew of these or took the trouble to examine
them? The point was that unless Australia was
prepared to tackle its problem of development, and
move forward at a pace which never previously had
been contemplated in regard to the absorption of
new population and the promotion of settlement,
she would be lost.
By coincidence a message dropped in the
same day from Darwin, the town with the
splendid harbor, where airman Cobham first
sighted Australia and received the impres-
sion that the scanty population consisted
mostly of loafing half-castes, whose colored
half was mixed beyond all reason. Darwin
is in the N. Territory, a place which the
Federal Government rules direct, and where
it alone is responsible for action and develop-
ment and settlement and all the other hur-
ried things of life. It was a message r*
the facilities for getting about between the
Territory’s principal ports, and getting about
is one of the essentials of progress. Some
of the simple and commonplace story follows:
The coastal ship Marion Sleigh has returned to
Darwin, having occupied two months going to Booro-
loola and back The Marion Sleigh went with
supplies to relieve starving settlers along the roast,
but got stuck on sandbanks so long and so often that
the passengers and crew were themselves on the verge
of starvation, begging food from the already starving
settlers to make their way back to Darwin. They were
fast on a sandbank at Macarthur River for 10 days, and
the day after the vessel was refloated she again
became” fast for two days The crew went on
hunger strike because of the bad and insufficient food
and water. The captain had gone up the river, but
the crew and passengers could not wait for Ids
return, and procured provisions from the Roper
settlers, including food which they had brought for
the Roper by the ship Then we went to the
East Alligator River A steam launch went up
the river with some passengers, but owing to muddy
salt water being used in the boiler, the engine con-
tinually gave trouble At Oenpelli we scut a
black gin eight miles for food. Two days later
we were again stranded, ami sent an aboriginal six
miles to fetch a kerosene-tin of water. . . . The engine
failing caused us to drift aground several times,
the ladies, blacks and sailors all sleeping in a
small launch at night.
It certainly is a place where actions arc
more necessary than words, and even more
necessary than the appointment of powerless
Commissioners. The League of Nations may
read this tale, and possibly a hundred like
it. a.ll including the sparse and starving
settler, the uncharted sandbanks and the
impossible little coffee-pot craft which gets
nowhere. And if the League also hears how
little is being done to improve the situation
it may, as Prime Minister .Bruce fore-
shadows, begin to draw the British Empire s
attention, and other people s attention. Then,
as Prime Minister Bruce forebodes, Aus-
tralia may be “lost.” The theory has been
advanced that if a standard-gauge railway,
capable of carrying fast traffic, was put
across Australia, and two white southern
cities were brought within three or four
days of the Territory, things might change.
(Should a Kalgoorlic or some such place be
developed in the process of building, that
would help.) With the brisk coming and
going of people very different from the
mixed and isolated handful of folk to whom
the place is accustomed, a new atmosphere
might be perceptible. Some real steamboats
might appear on the coast, capable of arriv-
ing at a given place in a good imitation of
a given lime. A more accurate knowledge
of the location of the principal sandbanks
might diffuse itself. And it might not be
necessary to send an aboriginal more than
a mile for a kerosene-tin of water, starving
settlers not being so far apart as they are
now. If the Prime Minister knows of any-
thing more qualified to carry inhabitants
quickly to the property for which he is re-
sponsible than a train on a railway, and
anything more calculated to allay the brood-
ing suspicions of the League of Nations, he
should produce his substitute. Settlement
by means of the Marion Sleigh has been
written down a failure.

Fair Figures in the Future.
Some forms of optimism do no good to this
country. Under the caption, “Australia,
What It Is and What It Will Be,” the Age
quotes the Commonwealth Statistician as
saying that at the present rate of increase
the population of Australia would double
every 35 years, becoming 48,000,000 in 105
years, and 384,000.000 in 210 years, “the
former exceeding the present population of.
Great Britain, the latter exceeding that of
India.” If the statistician and the newspaper
-mean these figures to be taken seriously,
several obstacles will have to be surmounted.
The reason why Norway, which lias a lot of
unoccupied territory and has been inhabited
for several thousand years, hasn’t got a bil-
lion Norsemen will have to be explained, and
reasons given why there are so few gillies,
comparatively speaking, in the Highlands
of Scotland. The fact is that the character-
istic curves of population growth in all coun-
tries show in the main precisely the same
features. The growth is slow at first, in-
creases gradually, attains a maximum point,
and then slowly diminishes to a straight line
or thereabouts. A sudden increase in man’s
power over nature—as in the age of steel
and steam —causes a new curve to be started ;
but, barring sudden changes, the curve fol-
lows the rule. Australia, with the world’s
second largest annual increase, is apparently
at the beginning of her climb. How high
she will go The Bulletin refuses to guess;
but one of the largest authorities, taking all
her resources into consideration and on the
analogy of Europe, places the limit of Aus-
tralia's ascent under present conditions at 40
millions, and allows her much more than
105 years to get there.
Industrial Freedom as Mr. Lang Sees It.
The bitterest enemy of Jack Lang, whom
Providence, in its wisdom, has placed at the
head of the Government of N. S. Wales, can-
not accuse the gentleman of indulging in
ambiguities and subtleties. He makes his
meaning perfectly clear —clearer to others l than
to himself, sometimes. His utterances on the
Federal referenda proposals are acasein'point.
He sees in them a deep-laid plot designed to
rob Australia of its “industrial freedom.’’
lie believes, or says he does, that as soon as the
Constitution has been altered in the way the
Government suggests, Bruce would be able to
“disband all the unions, imprison the leaders,
compulsorily enrol the workers into an army,
and set them to work under an armed guard.’’
He believes, or says he docs, that it would
be an extremely wrong and improper thing
to allow any Government to wield such
powers. He also says, quite emphatically,
that to give Judges or any other officials who
are beyond political control judiciary powers
in industrial disputes is to fetter gyves upon
the wrists of the toilers. It will be seen that
Mr. Lang is catholic in his objections. He
objects to the enlargement of Federal powers
because they will be handed over at the out-
set to Bruce, a political opponent. In the
second instance he objects because those
powers will be in the hands of permanent
officials —“authorities perched high above the
chosen representatives, telling Parliament to
mind its own business.” Sir. Lang thus
makes it quite clear —though he probably
doesn’t know it himself—that he doesn’t
believe in representative government at all.
distrusts any form of authority, and disap-
proves of any sort of political or industrial
freedom. There was a time when he may
have thought the Labor caucus was the voice
of God and the People rolled into one; But
he isn’t nowadays prepared to give either
Parliament or a Judge appointed by Parlia-
ment the right to butt in when, say, some
industrial buccaneer steals somebody else’s
union and tells it to go out on strike to
oblige a person named Riptispltzikoff or
Seir waktzhein pscijun who:rcsides far away
across the bounding main and dislikes the
Englishers. He stands four-square for the
right of union officials to do as they darned
well like without any interference from the
law. They must be allowed to fight out then-
own quarrels, decree strikes in their own or
other officials’ unions whenever they like and
continue them as long as they like, unham-
pered by arbitration courts, policenien or
auditors. And if. in addition to their other
activities, they control several State Parlia-
ments and decree who and who shall not be
elected to represent the people and what
laws shall and shall not be passed—well,
that's all part of Mr. Lang’s industrial
freedom.
Our Motor Politician.
Some desultory conversation about Northern
Territory railways was dragging along m
the House of Reps, in the last days of the
session when the incomprehensible Billy
Hughes volcano blew up again :
Mr. Hughes said that within the next five years
the number of motor-cars would be doubled. The
motor-car was the most flexible means of transport
iu the world. The road to the Northern Territory
could be made passable, except in the rainy season,
with the expenditure of a small amount of money.
A good road would pay for itself. It would increase
the value of the land and facilitate the movement
backwards and forwards of stock and produce. With
the expenditure of £300,000 good roads could be
made from the railhead all the way to Queensland.
No one knows why little Billy lias these
turns whenever the Territory is mentioned.
He never recommends a particular brand of
car for u.se up there, and he never urges that
railways are superfluous anywhere else —say.
in the suburbs of Sydney. It is a rather
sad picture which be draws. The number
of motor-cars is to be doubled in five years.
(This seems more than probable, for the
number licensed in Australia in June. 1 !!-•>,
apart from motor-bikes, was 247,518. having
nearly doubled in two years. Possibly the
increase will be 300 instead of 200 per cent,
in five years.) The bill for imported petrol,
which approaches £7,000.000 per annum now.
is to swell in proportion, and possibly the
bill for imported vehicles —already getting
near to £12,000,000 per annum. Australia
is to become so dependent on foreign fuel
that a stoppage of supplies (through war,
inability to pay, or through the other fellow
prohibiting export) will stop this continent.
Meanwhile William proposes to develop our
Northern Territory, first by building to it a
cheap highway which will be impassable m
the rainy season, and building in it £400,000
worth of tracks from the railway dead-end to
Queensland. What tracks from Dead End
to Queensland will do. especially if they
are also impassable in the wet season, doesn t
appear, nor does it transpire wliat kind of
roads can be supplied to a regioni of over
half a million square miles for £400,000 —
less than 12 bob per mile. Great States are
not built that way. It would be an interest-
ing but costly experiment if Parliament
offered William £300,000 and told him to
go and build a few decent roads from Dead
End to Queensland, and keep the change.
The Hughes variety of road in the N.T. is
to “pay for itself.” If samples of self-paying
road could be shown in Sydney and Mel-
bourne it should be an-attractive exhibition.
The eternal plea of William is that the
motor is the last thing in the way of flexi-
bility. but it isn’t. A bullock will go where
a motor can’t, and a bullock will turn round
and inspect its own hindquarters in a way

If the N.S.W. Nationalist party goes to law
■resolutely over the vacancy created by Kay’s
promotion to a steady job, it should win a
seat. The surprising Casual Vacancies Act
of 1920 provided that, on the death or retire-
ment of a member, his place should be filled
by the unsuccessful candidate of his party
who stood highest on the list. Kay won his
seat as an independent, belonging to no
party, and it is claimed by another indepen-
dent who stood for the electorate. This is
awkward; but Kay gave the Lang Govern-
ment a pretty general support, and that was
supposed to classify him as a Laborite on
the strength of this half-clause:
In determining what party interest was represented
by the iate member, the Clerk of the Assembly shall
have regard to the vote or votes (if any) of the
late member on any motion or motions of censure
during the present Parliament.
"The present Parliament” of 1920 died in
1922. Kay wasn’t a member of it. so he didn’t
vote on any motions of censure; therefore
it is claimed that the only possible excuse
for classifying him as Labor and putting a
Laborite in his place is null and void, blown
out, effete and dead. It was certainly a
clumsy Act, and, assuming the necessary
energy to pursue the “present Parliament” to
the bitter end, it should furnish a handsome
kettle of marine provender.

A deputation has invited the N.S.W. Cabi-
net to simplify life a little and remove oue
unproductive and expensive middleman ele-
ment out of the community by abolishing the
coupon or trading stamp, whether green, red,
blue, brown or striped. The business has
been described as the needless and cheeky
intervention of a useless third party between
buyer and seller. The retail buyer gets a
document of the face value of a small copper
with his shilling purchase. The seller puts
the cost of it on to the price of the goods
somewhere, though he doesn’t go out of his
way to mention the fact. When the buyer
has lost 10s. worth of coupons and saved
up 20s. worth, he can change the latter for
some article which isn't worth 20s. and
perhaps not worth anything near that
amount, for the middlemen expect to live
and pay expenses out of the industry. The
trader who gives coupons may do more busi-
ness, but the extra takings are apt to go in
paying for the little bits of paper. But
these aren’t given by everybody, for if every-
body gave them there would be no advantage
in anybody giving them, and the trader who
doesn t supply is apt to lose business. The
governing director of an old-established
coupon co. wrote indignantly to the press
saying that the net profits of the business
were much exaggerated, being less than 5 per
cent, on the turnover. That doesn’t prove
much, for in a cash line which requires no
costly factories and machinery, 5 per cent,
on the turnover may represent an enormous
amount per cent, on the capital. Other Aus-
tralian States have shut down on the coupon
trade, but the governing director explained
in the press, and seemed to regard the point
as a powerful argument on his side, that it
is not prohibited in the United States. Some
States started to abolish trading stamps, but
the Very Supreme Court ruled out their
laws as contrary to the Federal Constitution,
Which only goes to show that even the
best Constitution-makers may lack something
in vision. If Washington and Jefferson
had foreseen the coupon they would, have
forbidden if. So would Moses. If any
capable medium will get in touch with
Moses’s ghost, it can corroborate this state-
ment.

The faith manifested in the omnipotence of
“capitalistic” employers by the persons who
advocate shorter hours, higher wages and less
work is complimentary but embarrassing. In
the application of the Amalgamated Engi-
neers to the Full Court of Arbitration for a
14-hour week, the ability of the god-like
wagepayer to meet every kind of emergency
without turning a hair was specially insisted
on. Said C. Crofts, among other things:—
It was the fault of the employers and not of the
men that anything more than a 44-hour week was
required.
We should compel employers to do something.
The employers should find a way out of the diffi-
culty. . .
A 44-hour week would not mean lessened pro-
duction. Employers can always find a means of meet-
ing shortened production.
They can get the same production in 44 hours
as in 48 by altering their machinery.
And in view of the fact that an ounce of
example is worth a square mile of precept
it is a pity that the N. S. Wales Labor Gov-
ernment, as the employer who owns the State
road-metal quarries, should have put up the
price of rocks on accouut of the introduction
of 44 hours, and again by reason of the
AVorkers’ Compensation ; also that the Rail-
way Department should he so addicted to
blaming its troubles on the same sort of
thing. And it is regrettable that the habitual
Labor paper, run by men who ought to know,
seeing that they are so furiously positive
that every other employer should know, is
invariably such a financial dud. It ought
to bound along the road to affluence like the
blithesome wallaby.

The wreck of the ancient and tiny steamer
Seagull, plying between Port Stephens and
Newcastle (N.S.W.), once more calls atten-
tion to the number of frail old tincans
which are permitted to risk human life in
the N. S. Wales coastal trade. The 17-year-
old craft was just out of the inspector’s
hands, yet. running into a moderate gale
after leaving Port Stephens, she sprung a
leak, and was beached, fortunately without
loss of life. When one considei’s the great
loss of life due to the foundering of many
similar craft off the N. S. Wales coast in
the last few years, it is hard to believe that
there is nothing wrong with the standard of
seaworthiness demanded of them by the
authorities.

“Dingo” : News has lately been received that
England will in future refuse admittance to
the carcases of sheep from which any lym-
phatic glands have been removed. The pro-
hibition is aimed at the disease known as
caseous lymphadenitis or pseudo-tuberculosis,
the sheep, like the horse and goat, being for
all practical purposes immune from true
tuberculosis. The disease, caused by an
organism ( Triesz-Nocard bacillus), is almost
wholly confined to the lymph glands, where
it appears in the form of lesions greatly re-
sembling those of tuberculosis, except that
the pus, when present, is of a greenish color.
It is never fatal, and as far as is known
cannot, under natural conditions, be com-
raumcated to man or any other animal except
the sheep. The merino is the most suscept-
ible, and the disease is more frequently found
old sheep than in lambs. The means by
which it spreads are unknown. It has an
almost world-wide distribution, and although
I have no figures for Britain, it is common
in France, Germany, Belgium and Italy.
Carcases affected arc not totally condemned
at Homebush (N.S.W.). To what extent it
occurs m Australia is uncertain, as the
figures collected by observers vary enor-
mously. but I have heard butchers put it at
to per cent. My own experience leads me
to regard this as absurd, but it is undoubtedly
common enough to produce disastrous effects,
if not actual ruin, to our meat-export trade
if the prohibition is persisted in. It is said
that similar action has already been taken
against the Argentine mutton, lint this may
be only bluff; meat-exporters are suspicious
folk, and there are whispers to the effect
that South American interests are very
powerful in London.

A hasty member of the Richmond (Vic.)
Council recently said that Little Brothers,
brought here to become farmers, were driv-
ing good Australians out; of jobs in city
factories. Asked by Richard Linton,
founder of the movement, to name the lads
and the factories, the councillor said a man
had told him that three factory-boys had told
him they had been Little Brothers. Linton,
who has a file containing the present
addresses, state of mind and intended move-
ments of all Little Brothers in the State,
pursued the complaint further; and the
hasty bumble, being unable to produce a
brother, big or little, broke out in another
direction, with equally unsatisfying results.
Nevertheless, the Richmond Council listened
to these vague accusations, and passed a
resolution asking the Government to appoint
State and trades-union representatives to
the movement begun by Linton as an en-
tirely honorary affair. The trades-union boss
is to guard the temple of labor from the
dreadful menace presented by the Little
Brother. The State Government will, of
course, ignore the request. The Big Brother
movement is one of the few immigration
schemes that retain the personal touch. Aus-
tralia has as many of the bureaucratic kind
as she can afford to pay for at present.
Deab Bulletin, —I know nothing about Br.
Hirschfeld, one-time of Brisbane, but I do
lament the senseless outcry against the Fed-
eral authorities for permitting him to return
to his Australian family. I am English, and
did not shrink from my duty during the
war, but I have lived for some time on
the Continent since then, and have had
experience of German settlers in this and
other lands, and I do not hesitate to say
that the bitter feeling against men simply
on account of their nationality (for which
they are not responsible) is both unchristian
and irrational. We fought the Germans,
and, I am glad to say. beat them. But we
are not at war with Germany now. On the
contrary, our national relations have been
cordial for a long time past; in fact, we arc
more popular in Germany than in France,
Italy or Belgium. This may seem strange
to many people, but is certainly true. The
hulk of the German people are simple and
kindly, as well as industrious and sober. And,
let there be no mistake about this, they make
excellent colonists. As for the war, we
fought the Germans but once; for long years
we were their allies; we fought the French
for centuries. If any would-be immigrant—
whatever his nationality-—is of objectionable
character, let us by. all means close our
doors against him, but not simply because
we were formerly at war with his nation.
The Germans are. and must remain, a
great and intelligent people, and it is our
wisdom to cultivate (as the British Govern-
ment is doing to-day) good relations with
them. Our next war will not be against
Germany.—Yours, Frederick Stubbs.

The N. S. Wales Commissioner of Police
came back from a motor tour of the State
recently greatly impressed with the Out-
back's natural facilities for motor vehicles
and aeroplanes. Motor-cycles and -cars are
rapidly replacing horses among the mounted
police, while everywhere are hundreds of
natural aerodromes. The average policeman,
it was found, actually preferred to buy and
keep his own cycle rather than use Govern-
ment-owned and -maintained horses. This
is one more nail in the coftin of the blooded
“Waler,” for which the ranks of the mounted
police formed about the last reputable re-
fuge. All the same, Australia has a vast
territory that is impossible for flivvers and
flying-machines. The probabilities of cap-
turing offenders by means of either in moun-
tain and scrub country are remote, and the
fact may save a small percentage of Aus-
tralia's blooded saddle-horses from extinction.

“Basra"; There are a lot of things about
the Mesopotamian campaign that “Henry
1 lorsecoli ar" (B. 5/8/20) doesn't know.
I agree that the 13th Division was not
backed up properly, but it was not lack of
numbers that was responsible for our failure
to relieve Kut: it was lack of artillery, equip-
ment and transport. Owing to the shortage
of transport the force could not be
used for concerted action, but was dribbled
away. Sunnaiyat was finally captured after
an intense and prolonged bombardment (the
guns arrived after Kut fell), and in combina-
tion with an enveloping movement from
Shumran Bend. “IT.II.” may be right in the
number he quotes of living Mespot. V.C.’s;
but what about the dead ones? Three In-
dian V.C.’s were won during the fighting
for the relief of Kut alone. “Henry” charges
me with not having masticated my subject:
but actually I regard it as pre-digested. I
existed in Mesopotamia for three years, and
now spend part of my time assisting officers
with their study of the campaign.

Telegraphic communication with the outside
world continues to improve. Following on
the Eastern Extension Co.'s laying of a new
high-speed cable on the Indian Ocean side,
the Pacific Cable Board has placed contracts
with two British firms for the manufacture
of two speedy units for the crossing to
Canada. The total cost will be about
£2,372,070. The building of the beam wire-
less-station is proceeding at Ballan, in Vic-
toria, and the Marconi Co. reports that the
young Australians who were sent to England
to learn the working of the highly complicated
and delicate automatic instruments that will
be employed are far above the average of that
firm’s experience in aptitude and intelligence.
The mist that overhangs the English end of
the project is still somewhat opaque, but
there should be talk and back-talk this year.
When Joe Cook said in his High Commis-
sioner’s report that an unparalleled epoch
would be reached when these works were
completed, he was talking more than high-
sounding platitudes for once.

Political
Points
. The penalty for failing to vote in the re-
ferendum on Saturday,: unless you can pro-
duce a good excuse, is £2.
Some people think that if they vote “Yes
- —yes” on Saturday they will be handing
oyer new powers to unknown people. They
will do nothing of the kind. They will
simply be taking certain powers for them-
selves, to be exercised through their own
national Parliament elected on the broadest
franchise in the world. It is because the
national franchise is so broad that the Labor
party long ago declared in its fighting plat-
form for the extension of the powers of the
Federal Parliament. A “No —no” vote on
Saturday will leave all the powers specified
with the State Parliaments; and most of
them are undemocratic to the extent that
they have one Hons*' either a nominee
Chamber or a Chamber elected by a pro-
perty vote. “No—no” wall, therefore, be a
vote in favor of nominee or property Cham-
bers and against a Legislature which is
wholly democratic.
The Reds and Pinks of the motley army of
provincialism are shouting that, if the Con-
stitutional alterations are carried on Sep-
tember 4, N.S.W. and Queensland unionists
will lose their 44-hour week. But if con-
ditions Avon’t allow 7 of it they will lose it
anyhow 7. And even as things are. without
any amendment, employers who are finding
it a burden can easily manufacture a dispute
“extending beyond the limits of one State”
—union secretaries have shown them a hun-
dred times how it can be done-—and apply
to the Federal Arbitration Court for a 48-
hour award. And such an award prevails
over any conflicting State award or enact-
ment, as the Lang crowxl ought to have
learned,
When Britain’s 13 lost colonies became
United States they surrendered all their
“waste lands” to the Federal Government,
which saved a lot of trouble in the making
of new 7 States later on. These lands were to
a great extent only claims, and there were
Indians and bears on them ; yet had it not
been for the surrender Virginia might now
extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific, just
as Westralia spreads from the Southern
Ocean to the Timor Sea, watching the Pole
with with one eye and the Equator with the
other. But perhaps Australian Federation
w 7 ould have fallen through if a surrender of
"waste lands” had been put in the bill. We
are pretty poor Federalists, at best.
A point worth noting in connection with
the coming referendum is that the U.S.A.,
in spite of the drastic Sherman Anti-Trust
Act, is asking for further powers to con-
trol trusts and combines, as the Bruce Min-
istry is doing. Various loopholes are to be
closed, for the inventive Yankee has found
new ways of bringing competitors to heel.
None of these methods have achieved much
popularity in Australia so far, but their
existence is a strong argument in favor of
a single control as opposed to six different,
varying State enactments under some of
which they and other tricks of the sort may
be able to find encouragement.
Although it sends wailing State Righters
to tiie Commonwealth Parliament and periodi-
cally erupts secessionists, Westralia, and
Westralia alone, has consistently supported
Federal referendum proposals. While the
other States have Yes-Noed bewildcringly,
the West has said Aye every single time. A
No vote on Saturday w 7 ould be a blot on a
noble record.
Australia loses the services of a very
valuable man by the retirement, through ill-
health, of John Garvan from tlie chairman-
ship of the Commonwealth Bank. This
cdujitty was exceptionally fortunate in the
little group of men whose services it secured
at ridiculously small pay to be the first
directors; and John J. Garvan has added
inches to his stature since he took the job
two years ago. At the outset he had
many enemies among bankers, who thought
that lie had done quite wrong when as chair-
man of the Notes Board he had sat hard on
the issue of more paper to the banks, even
in exchange for gold. What happened when
the gold basis was restored showed how far-
sighted lie had been: Australian paper
was found to be worth a shade more even
than British. Robert Gibson, the deputy-
chairman, will probably follow him in the
chair; but if he does he ought to arrange to
throw off some of his other jobs. He has
too many irons in the fife, and that is no
good for a man with such large responsibilities
as tlie chairman of the Commonwealth Bank.
In the course of a Sydney Domain Sunday
oration Premier Lang assured all concerned
that, any reports of dissension in the party
or the Caucus or the Cabinet might be sum-,
matily dismissed—just as his Government
dismisses civil servants when it: is in a bilious
mood. Still, the Premier, and another Min-
ister, and a prominent Communist whom
they both profess to repudiate sit together on
the board of the official Labor paper, and
the Caucus, which runs the party add is
itself run by an outside organisation, ordered
the paper to withdraw and apologise for
something it said about the party, whereupon
it promptly did neither. Wherefore Lang,
as a Premier and member of the Caucus,
apparently comes into violent collision with
himself as a newspaper director, and if he
meets himself unexpectedly and won’t apolo-
gise trouble may ensue. He may even make
a cowardly assault on himself in the rear.
SIGNING TEE PLEDGE.
“The N.S.W. Industrial Commissioner has admitted the New South Wales branch of the Seamen’s
Union of Australasia to registration under the Arbitration laws.”
Queensland Labor Premier McCormack
has been plainly told that the A.W.U. no
longer regards him as a cobber. A dreadful
collection of fowls came home to roost at
once. The last deficit was £555,000, tin;
disastrous State copper-mine was closed, esti-
mates were cut down, railway rates were put
up, and plans are laid for largely increasing
taxation, already the heaviest in Australia.
The case was one where a kind word or a
helpful suggestion would have been welcome,
but the rank and file of the party believes in
walloping the laden horse on an up-grade.
So a demand came from the North for a 40-
hour week on the railways and another in-
crease of pay, and there was even mention of
a shorter week, and no one offered a sugges-
tion except that it is the business of “Bill”
to make blacks whether he has straw or not.
It came out last week that when the great
Sydney business of Anthony Hordern and
Sons, Ltd., was sold £1,700,000 of the pro-
ceeds Was invested in 5i p.c. Commonwealth
Government stock. Sydney Sun, in giving
particulars of the transaction, said: —
The securities are taxable by the Federal Income-
tax Commissioner, but are exempt from State taxa-
tion. In the event of the Federal authority with-
drawing from the field of income-taxation —a develop-
ment which has been foreshadowed—the stock would
be relieved of that burden, and its value to the
investors would undergo proportional enhancement.
Another good reason, as Sam Hordern would
cheerfully admit, why Treasurer Page should
hang on to his income-tax. Another good
reason why he should force the States to
abandon their income-taxes, devote the per
capita money and the difference between tax-
revenue surrendered and acquired to the pay-
ment of interest on such State debts as lie
can arrange to take over (50 p.c. perhaps),
and convert tax-free into taxable issues as
fast as he can.
Last week Sydney’s City Councillors re-
solved that their rent collectors should be
permitted to carry revolvers, “especially in
the Brisbane-strect area.” Apart from this
lapse into Chicagoan practices, there arc
other aspects of an interesting nature in the
proposal. Ohe is that the inhabitants of an
area where rent collectors have to go armed
have the. right to vote for the aldermen, all
Labor, representing the wards in which it is
situated, It is hardly surprising in those
circumstances that some people think city
ratepayers ought to have the right to arm
themselves against the City Council.
Josiah Syffion, K. 0., has come out of his
retirement to give a legal opinion against
the South AtiSi Railways Commissioner’s
new practice of running motor-’buses on the
highroads. “A corporation created to con-
struct, run and manage railways cannot
undertake the business of carrying passengers
over the public roads of the State—a totally
different business.” But any private 'bus-
owner aggrieved cannot take proceedings
against the Commissioner without the con-
sent of the Attorney-General of the State; so
the matter isn't much for'arder.
N.S.W. Premier Lang is so mistrustful that
he radiates suspicion. Hence, no doubt, the
Labor Daily story that four Labor Assem-
blymen are in danger of being bought with
£32,000 of Nationalist lucre —it was £20,000
last year. Hence also the assertion of Rat-
cliffe, M.L.A., one of Lang’s herb-like fol-
lowers, that “the people of Victoria are going
to get a rough spin on Federal referendum-
day because the only scrutineers in the booths
will be men appointed by Bruce, whereas
the N.S.W. Labor Government is appointing
scrutineers to see that the vote is counted
properly.” In other words, Yes electors,
Commonwealth electoral officials and Com-
monwealth Government are (in the elegant
parlance of the selection-ballot aristocracy)
“crooks.” Demagogues moving in the gutter
politics of Sydney, and knowing no other
sort of politics, naturally think like that.
The Westralian Premier has announced
that no workmen’s compensation insurance
is to be done in that State save by the State
office. It may not matter much; still, as
some Premier may take a fancy to seize on
all fire and life business also, it may be worth
recalling that insurance legislation belongs
to the Commonwealth, if the Commonwealth
wasn’t so tired. Almost the same day the
N.S.W. Government gave Astronomer Cooke
the peremptory sack. That may not matter
much either: still the astronomical job be-
longs to the Commonwealth likewise, if the
Commonwealth wasn’t so exhausted.
When Tom Ryan became Labor Premier
of Queensland, and for years after, there
were eight salaried Ministers, two of whom
—Jones and Lennon—were in the _ Leg.
Council. Though the Leg. Council is no
more, and administrative work is being light-
ened by the scrapping of State enterprises
on which Ryan and Theodore embarked, pro-
vision for a tenth salaried Minister is made
in the Grab Bill, which scatters among Min-
isters and members another £lB,OOO p.a.
Borrowing a wrinkle from the Langs and
Badl.vs. McCormack and Co. have arranged
for the beneficiaries to draw two months’
back pay at the higher rate —about £42
apiece. Attoruey-Gencral Mullan, in intro-
ducing the measure, said his party hadn’t
mentioned it on the hustings because “you
can’t get a mandate in matters of this kind.”
Parliament, in other words, is an institution
from which you get what you dare not ask
the people for. No wonder so many of the
State members don’t want the present powers
of the State Parliaments disturbed.
Maoriland legislators, who now get £450
a year, are going to try for £6OO ; and it is
not a penny too much. But the present Par-
liament has no right to more than £450.
An employer who offers £450 a year for a
manager will naturally get £450-a-year men ;
it lie offered £6OO a year he would probably
get offers from dozens of men with larger
qualifications. Half the men in the present
House might not have got there had the
higher pay been offered before the election.
If the practice of dipping into the cashbox
for more money is encouraged, the time may
come when a Parliament in the last week
of the session will reduce the member’s pay
to £5O a year in order to scare off outsiders,
who won’t know that old members have
entered into a secret covenant to vote them-
selves another five or six hundred in the first
few weeks of the new Parliament.
The N.S.W. Farmers and Settlers’ Con-
ference, sitting in Sydney, came to the fami-
liar decision that the farmer isn’t protected,
but is a downtrodden victim of duties im-
posed in the manufacturers’ interests. About
the same time the farming community had
an appeal before the Tariff Board that the
protective duty on potatoes should be raised
from £1 to £4 per ton. and the general sec-
retary of the Primary Producers’ Association
of N.S.W. gave evidence in support. The
application was logical, but it proved over
again that the alleged Freetradc of the
agriculturist is a fraud.
The Act promised by the Lang Govern-
ment for the suppression of the drug traffic in
N. S. Wales hardly looks capable of hurting
anybody. The maximum penalty for an
illegal sale or possession of any of the for-
bidden narcotics is to be a fine of £5O, or
six months, which is unlikely to be much
of a deterrent to dope traffickers, who fre-
quently make a profit of £3O on an ounce of
cocaine. At the close of the war, when a
dope wave swept over England, the British
Government introduced a measure which pro
vided gaol in substantial doses without the
option of a fine for anybody convicted of
illicit trafficking in narcotics; and that did
make a stir.
After half a century of swaddling in the
reddest tape, the Maoriland Railways have
fallen into the hands of a Minister who
reckons the day wasted unless his officers
have produced at least one brand-new idea
about management. A recent bright notion
which causes old railway servants to grit
their teeth is that the service ought to do
its best to cultivate the goodwill of the
public. Another is that in cases where motor
traffic is beating the railway the department
ought to take over the road service. Under-
lying both, of course, is the realisation that
the railways are no longer the snug monopoly
they used to be. And underneath that again,
it may be guessed, is a conviction on the
part of Priminister Coates, who also runs
the railways, that some day the State will
find it advisable to get out of the trade alto-
gether.

—Production at the steelworks was not con-
tinuous : coal supplies were cut oft for
several weeks owing to the strike of colliery
engine-drivers. Slack trade also played a
part, and keen overseas competition closed
down the merchant mills for portion of the
year. It is not that direct imports from
Continental countries are tremendous. But
low wages and conditions there have made
it possible for them to expand their market
in Freetrade England: British imports of
iron and steel have increased five or six
times in the past four years. Faced with
such competition English manufacturers have
been compelled to reduce prices to hold trade.
With every prospect of the situation thus
created becoming worse, the B.H.P. appealed
to the Government for further Protection.
The Tariff Board considered the application,
and since the report was issued the amended
schedule of duties has been passed. While
the Protection against the foreign products
seems to be adequate, British goods can still
compete to some extent. On heavy steel, for
instance, the revised rates are: British, 355.
to 48s. per ton ; foreign, 120 s. to 1255. The
previous tariff came into force on March 24,
1920, but it is unlikely that the latest altera-
tions will remain undisturbed for a similar
period. Not only are Australian wages high
and conditions favorable to the worker, but
the tendency is upwards, whereas European
standards have fallen and have not yet
reached bottom. While the latest tariff
amendments will assist earnings for the cur-
rent year, there will be something on contra
account. The 44-hour week was in force
during part only of last year, there has
been lately a further increase in the price of
coal, and tin- new Workers’ Compensation
Act of N.S.W. came into force after the
present accounts closed. Of course, the co.
is not sitting back idle; improvement of
plant goes on all the time.
Despite the stoppage production was
almost equal to that of the previous 12
months :

An increase was recorded in the manufac-

lons was not sufficient to meet the demand.
Naphtha amounting to 75,051 gallons was
turned out. By-products help to ease the
troubles of the B.H.P. and its keenness in
that direction merits a cheer. Last year, for
instance, in addition to the usual by-products,
large quantities of crushed slag were supplied
to municipalities and the Main Roads Board
for track-making. Shaft-sinking on the co.’s
coal properties has been held up since the
beginning of the year owing to industrial
trouble. Of the co.’s other activities Ryland’s
(now merged) had to meet severe competi-
tion. while operations were dislocated by the
strikes of its own workers as well as that of
the colliery engine-drivers.
Although the B.H.IVs sales of all pro-
ducts, steel and mineral, were slightly lower,
expenditure on working account was cut
back, and increases in interest, divs., etc.,
improved the gross nrofit beyond the 19-5
figures :

Net profit, according to the accounts, was

the Broken Hill mine as special deprecia-
tion. The latest accounts show £78,699
special depreciation “on mines, quarries and
miscellaneous plant.” That made a total
of £298,804 visibly wiped off, but it is not
likely that the management missed any weak-
ness or possible weakness, and the Wild Cat
casts a dubious eye on the heavy sums
spent on plant and improvements and
charged to working account.

At the close of the- 1.923 accounts excess lia-

improvement amounts to £1,047,477 ; of that,
however, new capital accounts for £232,660
and premiums £75,289 —total, £307,949.
To-day the Barrier property is dwarfed
by the Newcastle enterprise; nevertheless,
the report affirms that “the financial result
of the year’s work can be largely attributed
to the co.'s silver-lead mine.” Continuous
operation—-production of 156,449 tons was
the best effort since the 214.198 tons of 1917
plus highly-profitable prices, must certainly
have represented something sweet, although
it is impossible to ascertain net mining re-
sults owing to the lumping of all earnings.
Crude ore and tailings to the amount of
137.882 tons were treated for 10,939 tons
of jig lead concentrates, while in the dota-
tion plant (Bradford process) 126.943 tons
were treated for 16.315 tons lead concen-
trates and 18,759 tons zinc ’(rates. During
the term the co. sold its holding in the Asso-
ciated Smelters. Although the diamond drill
failed to locate any new ore bodies, work
in connection with the re-opening of Block
13 fire area made good progress, and the
Potosi —an outlying mine-—was developed
and equipped for the production of small
quantities of sulphides. Ore reserves are
governed by market values; if prices hold
at anywhere near present levels there is pro-
bably six years of life ahead of the co.’s
properties. Time after time, however, the
total tonnage of ore mapped has proved elas-
tic; time after time the reprieve has arrived
to save the life of the parent property. And
so the six years may still be six years six
years hence. The outlook for lead and spelter
is promising, but it is unwise to forecast.
Steel is the more stable proposition. Buy-
ers like the prospects, and are prepared to
take any shares offering at 30s.

Again profits were less than the dividend,
though the price of gas was raised twice
during the year. Since the close of tie;
accounts it has been done again, the figure
to-day being ss. Bd. per 1000 c. ft. The
detailed causes make an impressive list. The
basic wage was lifted 2s. per week as from
August 24, 1925; large coal was advanced
Is. 6d. per ton on November 30, 1925; the
44-hour week came into operation as from
January 4, 1920. The new workers’ com-
pensation has to be carried from July 1, and
another shilling fell on to tin; price of coai,
large and small, as from July 5. The last
two, of course, lie beyond the present
accounts. It was early borne in on the co.’s
211,843 consumers (10,786 were added dur-
ing the year) that the increased wage to
Tom Smith and the vague but wide compen-
sation protection afforded Bill Jones cost
money, and the cost has to be borne in part
by their fellow-workers. Fortunately the
amendment of the Gas Act in the second half
permitted the co. to effect economies, and
costs were further cut by using plant “of the
most modern design and of a labor-saving
type” which had been erected to meet in-
creases in the demand for gas. The latter
advantage will, however, be less obvious dur-
ing the winter months, when big consump-
tion will necessitate the older type of plant
being brought into commission. On the other
hand the amendments to the Act make
it possible for gas cos. to use coal from mines
nearer their plants and permit them to sup-
ply outer districts at prices compatible with
the extra costs, and this will ease the posi-
tion somewhat by next balance. The col-
liery engine-drivers’ strike impressed the
management with the necessity of storing
more coal; and as the co.’s winter consump-
tion is 9000 tons a week, the decision repre-
sents another burden on both capital and
revenue. Moreover, although a penny lias
already been added to meet the cost of the
new workers’ compensation, it seems certain
that the co. will find the cost of most stores
higher when new contracts have to be made.
And this won't help :
Though empowered to use the roads for its mains,
the company, having regard to the public nature of
its services, lias entered into an agreement with the
Main Roads Board and with the great majority of
the municipal councils of the metropolitan area to
remove its mains into the footways where required.
The cost of such removals will be borne equally by
the company and the authorities. A very considerable
sum of money will be involved by these removals.
Shareholders can look for nothing better
than 8 p.c. Increasing costs will make it
difficult if not impossible to reduce outgoings ;
and even if circumstances made it possible
to take advantage of the clause which per-
mits bigger divs. when the price is reduced
below the standard, to do so would be to
invite Government interference. The 8 p.c.,
however, is not presently in doubt, for effi-
cient management is expanding the market
for gas despite the widening use of electri-
city; and increases in costs, after all. affect
both industries. It is accepted, of course,
that the amount set aside for “special pur-
poses” and depreciation was sufficient. The
Act permits an annual vote of 34 p.c. of the
capital outlay on premises and plant to this
fund. Here are recent figures

Actually the co. was entitled to appropriate
almost £lBO,OOO, and the fund would have
been within the limit at half a million. Losses
through strikes may be charged against the
fund, and £BlOO was so debited last year.
The expenditure of the balance was on re-
moval and replacement of plant. To finance
expansion 40,000 new shares were auctioned
during the term, and share premiums in
creased by £23.042. Now that a widening
of the eo.'s field on a more secure and profit-
able basis is possible, further issues of capital
may be looked for.

111 this kind of business the success makes
its profit out of what the failure wastes;
hence the need for keen buying and alert
supervision. There was slackness in 1923,
and, in the second half a loss of £238 was
recorded—a setback in the co.’s history which
would have sadly disturbed its founders. In-
cidentally, accounts were presented half-
yearly to the date mentioned; in the table
the figures have been consolidated through-
out to permit of readier comparison. To-
day, notwithstanding a bonus division in
1920, so satisfactory has the recovery been
that reserves are at their highest point—
would, indeed, be at their highest even with-
out the handsome profit made on the sale of
the co.’s Melbourne freehold. But they are
still too modest alongside paid capital and
outside liabilities.
Profits are shown after provision has been
made for depreciation of “premises, plant,
fittings, machinery etc.,” and the directors
report the shops and factory in first-class
order; “no reasonable expense is spared to
this most essential end.” Recognition of
that fact and accurate judgment of the
necessities will insure a reasonable amount
of security to shareholders ; but it is never
safe to lose sight of the fact that, while a
business of the sort is capable of making
large profits, it is also capable of sudden
reversals. And, unfortunately, these rever-
sals affect capital as well as revenue. Thus,
“furniture, fittings, plant, machinery and
utensils at tearooms, cafes, offices, factories
and stores” are in at £90,675 (£100,070 in
1925) ; and while that is probably well under
replacement cost, it is probably well over
what could be got on a forced sale.
Balance-sheet figures for the year show
the influence of the new capital:—
1914. 1923. 1924. 1926.
Capital .. £lOO,OOO £175,000 £175,000 £223,193

Heavy sums have been put into freeholds of
recent years. Premises present a difficult
problem to businesses of this character. Tea-
shops must be in the busiest centres; and
the busiest centres are those where rentals
are highest. Increasingly, therefore, the ten-
dency is for retailers to buy freeholds in
order to preserve their goodwill, without be-
ing stung repeatedly by landlords, who are
not slow to recognise that a great part of
a goodwill may attach to the premises.
Having declared its policy the co. is carry-
ing it out rather thoroughly. In 1925 two
city freeholds were bought, and last year
three more and one in Oxford-street; and
a Melbourne co. (Thistle Prop.) was
taken over. These transactions added
£157,698 to the freeholds item (net move-
ment in leaseholds was a reduction), and
£102,000 was added to mortgages, making the
total of the latter £177.500 —a heavy load.
The increase in capital by the issue of
113.377 new shares (called to 55.: £19,849
calls paid in advance at June 30) will, when
all payments are in, bring capital to £288.377,
and that, plus the heavy sums of outside
money at risk, calls for more support than
is given by present reserves. True, the 15
p.e. div. was comfortably earned last year;
but considering the much heavier amount
that will be necessary when the new shares
are fully paid, the 15 p.c. was decidedly
liberal. At the same rate the full amount
will call for £43,256, and a glance at recent
profits shows that the management will have
to excel itself to do it and give reserves the
attention they should have. Latest sales
were at 355., and there was a good demand
at that figure, which is flattering to the scrip.

Competition both in inter-State and overseas
trade was very keen, but Mangrovite cap-
tured a fair share of the business. Pro-
bably 50 p.c. of our leather exports go to
Java or China, and chairman Charles Ludo-
wici commented caustically on the mainten-
ance of export regulations which handicap
Australian producers in their fight for mar-
kets. Originally imposed to meet European
trade requirements, they now are merely a
burden on the industry and the primary pro-
ducers concerned. The matter is worthy of
investigation by the Federal Government.

the Commonwealth has made available for
boring there. But why drag in Senator
Pearce, Billie Hughes and Marr, M.H.R.,
who knoAv as much about oil- and coal-mining
as a sparrow about stevedoring? The dis-
appointment over Taranaki’s first attempts,
although oil exists on the seashore, is enough
to make the average investor sloav at provid-
ing cash for oil cos. merely because of geo-
logical reports, much less because of chunks
of make-weiglit Hansard talk. As a coal
possibility, Belford Dome has other consid-
erations. Boring certainly is worth doing
to test the lie of the Greta seams, but surely
no half-million float is needed to do that or
even try for oil or gas? Why should the
Hunter River crowd be given a call over
125,000 paids when those who provide the
cash for work arc to fare no better? Sub-
scribers also are tied down to apply for
option certificates within a month after
notice of allotment of their contributing
scrip. This time-limit ought to be scrapped
and replaced by an agreement that upon
allotment of contributing shares any option
should automatically operate. If not it is
better to buy Hunter River paids, which have
no limited liability and which carry as good
an option minus any time-limit.

Morning Star (Vic.) glows dimly in
George Dickenson’s office. The sporty crowd
which hangs on even with the Millers out
parted up 3s. a share, mostly to shaft-sink,
develop and get the mine drilled at 920 ft.
Blanks were draAvn throughout. Gold Avon
brought in about £3OOO, but a loss of £10,735
Avas made. To keep the debit at p. and 1.
within bounds, £7600 was brought in from
the equalisation reserve created in the hal-
cyon days. Although the board seems in the
blues, Manager John Till, who sees as far
into a diorite dyke as the best, says that
the faces at present being worked slioav "‘in-
dications of meeting” with improved values
in the near future.

Linked up with the Palfreyman-Flack
talent, and with Eric Byron Moore in the
saddle, Return Creek tin. near Mt. Garnet,
of sad N.Q. memories, starts on a mining
career. The kingpin is the Return Creek
dam, with 60,000.000 gallons stored. In the
foreground lies 372 acres, on 90 acres of
Avhicli Eric Moore bored and sank shafts.
Lie swears to 3,100,000 c. yds. of drift aver-
aging LI lb. oxide. The Avash is shingly and
easily dredgeable. Other patches of ground
are said to go to 21b. ; but having learnt
wisdom in Malaya, he won’t testify as to the
outside ground until he can satisfy himself.
Costs are put at 4d. a c. yd. Taking them
at 6d., with a recovery of 90 p.c., the dredge
is to bring in £3720 profit a month provided
tin ranges at £270 a ton—-a high level. To
put a plant on to treat 60,000 c. yd. a month
—on which the foregoing figures rest —Avill
cost only £34,000.

The second borehole at Southern Lode
Continuation (8.H.) Avas down 150 ft. in
hanging wall country Avlien the latest bulletin
was issued, and the lode is expected at 300 ft.
Block 38, the scene of the flutter, reports a
zinc lode 20ft. Avide 200 ft. west of No. 1
bore, and a lead lode 10ft. wide separated
from the zinc lode by 30ft. of schist. The
present mining policy is to see what No. 2
bore reveals, before putting No. 3 down to
pierce the lodes at greater depth. No less
than 25,000 of the 100,000 contribs. changed
hands in last week’s gamble.
Bribbaree, on the Stoekinbingal-Forbes
line (N.S.W.), struggles on. Between the
parent show and its pup, the Bonanza, a
prospecting shaft down to 23 feet is all in
conglomerate. Another similar attempt 180 ft.
east of the Bonanza workings was sunk to
28ft. in slate with floors dipping 50deg.
southerly. From the Bribbaree shaft the
stope being worked is almost cut out to the
surface, and 60ft. away a footwall crosscut
driven 16ft. disclosed 3ft. of poor ore, and
so was discontinued. Shareholders who hung
on when the market was ss. are wondering
where their judgment was.

W. E. Gardner, Sulphide Corp.’s manager
at Broken Hill, reports good progress in re-
opening the fire area in the Central Mine.
Operations at the 400-, 500- and 600-feet
levels are progressing, no gas has been met
and there has been no inconvenience in
working. How much, if any, fire is left will
not be definitely ascertainable until the work-
ings get further in.

The Wonder Extended (N.Q.) may replace
the old Standard Consolidated, much lamented
by Charters Towers shareholders, which col-
lapsed when tin concentrates could scarcely
be given away at the outbreak of war. J. 11.
Reid’s diagnosis gives it a big chance worked
as a low-grade show. The crop is big, thou-
sands of tons could be put out by open-cut,
and his assays all show values from -J- p.c.
to 2§ p.c. oxide. The lode crops for 10
chains, carrying tourmaline and low tin
values, and may be 50ft. wide. Tt is recom-
mended that a syndicate be formed to con-
centrate on shallow development with a
tiew of company-scale operations if pre-
liminaries are O.K. Although it has been
worked slightly as a gouger’s show in the
past, Reid says it is not impressive in that
light despite the fact that he washed a few
samples that left about 20 p.c. grey tin on
the dish. Although there are occasional
patches of rich dirt they will become in-
creasingly expensive to locate in the great
mass of low-grade formation.

Bill Hedges, ex-M.11.R., head of the co.
which supplies the ICalgoorlie mines with
firewood, has been nominated as B. H. Prop.’s
representative on the Westralian Manganese
Co.’s board. Hedges’s experience as an old
railway contractor will be invaluable in the
construction of the line which is about to
be built from Meekatharra to the deposits
near Peak Hill. Estimates of visible ton-
nage there, vouched for by the State Mining
Engineer and other experts, range from over
a million to millions of tons, and the gross
value of the ore in sight is estimated at
£13,000,000. It is doubtful whether the co.
as at present constituted is financially strong
enough to carry on until the production
stage is reached. B. 11. Prop., which holds
£lO,OOO Avorth of shares and debentures, is,
however, considered a good support.

ICalgoorlie has put some money into asbes-
tos ventures on the Gascoyne (W.A.), and is
trying to induce eastern investors to come in.
High-grade stuff is said to bo in sight, and
good profits are declared to be assured. Some
tin areas further north in the Marble Bar
district are included as a make-weight.
Rockingham, near Fremantle (W.A.), is
again being billed as an oilfield. A year or
tAvo ago some fluid floating on swamps near
there was tested and found to be of vegetable
origin. Since then a number of shallow
bores have been put doAvn by people who
hold a different opinion, and these optimists
have noAv induced the Government to get
its experts to take more samples. Their
report is not expected to differ from the one
previously submitted. So far, it is sad to
have to admit, not one pannikin of oil has
been produced by any oil show in Westralia.
Things look brighter for the Corryong
syndicate Avhich is interested in the Rising
Sun lease on* Lake Le Page (W.A.). W.
Rees, a director, who inspected the show,
gives it a sft. formation which for a length of
400 ft. samples up to s£oz. a ton. But what
is the average with over ounce samplings
rejected? Xo. 2 shaft is said to have got
the lode and 2oz. stone at 30ft. That is
something to start Avith. As tAvo shafts
250 ft. apart are to go down to 40 or 50 feet,
the Corryong Avill soon learn if it has been
spending its money in vain.
Associated Northern's accounts for the
year ended September 30, 1925 (headquarters
are in London), disclose that receipts were
£37,032, expenditure on ICalgoorlie and Ora
Banda mines was £26,722 and administrative
expenses accounted for £2337. Investments
are valued at £44,441. They include shares
in Canadian Lorraiu silver-mines and
Wiluna (W.A.). Both these ventures are
reckoned to be good things. Expenditure on
the co.’s former “golden holding"’ in Mexico
is given as £20,260. This show promised
well, but owing to the unsettled state of the
country had to be abandoned.
Golden Butterfly has flitted to another
place. This time it has settled at ICurannali
(N.T.), wjxex*e an option has been taken on
a block close to where gold is said to be
visible. Hansel Mundy, Mutooroo, Radio
South and other cos. which have got tired of
looking for mines in Westralia are also there
and have clubbed together to pay an expert
for a report on their holdings. The field is
declared to have good prospects; but, of
course, all new fields are like that.

South Kalgurli’s receipts for the 12 months
ended March 31 totalled £199,002 inclusive
of £OOOO transferred from bullion reserve.
Shareholders received for the sixth year m
succession 2s. 6d. a share and £897 was left
to carry forward. At the close of the year
ore reserves were estimated at 215,000 tons
of 9.27dwt. ore and 99,000 tons of probable
6.63dwt. ore. Chairman Marker complained
in London on July 21 that in common with
other Westralian mineowners the co. was
continually called upon to pay further taxa-
tion which nullified its efforts to reduce
costs. One notable instance was miners’
phthisis insurance, which, added to the previ-
ous burden for employers’ liability, repre-
sented Is. 4d. per ton on the present output.
But it doesu’t follow from this that the
present rate is Is. 4d. too much. The old
rate may have beeu Is. 4d. too little, through
neglect to do things which should have been
done. The chairman ridiculed Royal Com-
missioner Kingsley Thomas's strictures on
Kalgoorlie mine management, declaring that
Thomas had condemned that of South Kal-
gurli after an hour or two’s stroll about
the surface.

Net profit of Lake View and Star for the
year ended February 28 was £7155 plus
£9624 brought forward; £9721 has been
written off depreciation and £4684 book
value of tailings re-treated during the year,
leaving £2374 to be carried forward. Direc-
tors blame additional outlay on improve-
ments in ore extraction and' timbering for
increased costs and reduced profits. They
add that in order to cheapen costs additions
are being made to the treatment plant. Total
ore reserves are estimated at 759,363 tons of
a gross average value of 30s. 9fd. This in-
cludes 109,507 tons of broken ore reckoned to
be worth 31s. sd. per ton. But under pre-
sent working conditions the prospect of sub-
stantial profits from the mining and treat-
ment of this ore is not rosy.
* * * *
Chairman Moreing had rather a doleful
tale to tell at the Sous of Gwalia meeting
in London on July 13. He said that in the
preceding year a profit of £11,824 was made,
of which £Bl6l was from gold premium. Last
year the gold premium dropped to £955 and
the profits of preceding years not only van-
ished, but had been replaced by a loss of
£1231, despite extensive additions and im-
provements made to the plant. Additional
costs due to reduced working time, increased
wages, and fresh taxation cumulatively had
for the time being wiped out all possibility
of profit. The silver lining to the co.’s dark
cloud was the Cornish china-clay pits, which
he predicted would be a source of profit and
the mainstay of the co.’s future.

Mararoa (W.A.) reported some time ago
that all was well with its newly-installed
mill on Reedy’s mine. A little later it was
declared on this page that there w T as no truth
in this yarn. Now the co. confesses that
negotiations are almost complete for the pur-
chase of a “suitable treatment plant” from
the State Government, and that the board
considers this to be a “satisfactory solution
of all the difficulties which have been affect-
ing the successful carrying on of all the com-
pany’s affairs during recent years.” The
Bulletin still has its doubts.

Shareholders in Malayan tin concerns will
better appreciate the labor difficulties, and
the consequent delay in starting operations,
after reading the report of the Chief Secre-
tary of the Federated Malay States, Sir
George Maxwell, dated 11/6/’26. He says
that out of a provision of nearly 10,000,009
dollars (Straits) the Government was able
to spend only 4,750,000. This was due
almost entirely to the scarcity of labor.
Road contractors could get but few coolies,
and building contractors could not lay hands
on carpenters and masons. One can hardly
imagine an Australian Government wfith
money to spend making excuses for not
doing it.

Burma Corp. still reports big figures. The
March quarter showed revenue of £822,877,
giving a net profit of £346,282. The plant
treated 79,500 tons of ore, giving 20.6 p.c.
lead, 12.9 p.c. zinc, and 18.20 z. silver.
Malim Nawar South (F.M.S.), floated
a couple of years ago, has started work, tin;
dredge setting in last Thursday. Cabled
reports show that the plant, which embodies
many new tin-saving devices, is running
sweetly, though only the day shift is being
worked till tuning-up is completed. Shares
moved a trifle in response to the news of
the satisfactory start. The property is on
the Kiuta River, Perak. Managing-director
Malcolm Newman has sized it up as con-
taining 35 bullion cubic yards of pound stuff
and 15 million yards rated at fib. This gives
the property a life of 25 years at 150,000
yards a month. The new dredge has 12 c. f.
buckets, and can dig to 75 feet, and 80 feet
at a pinch. Newsom jigs are installed, and
recoveries are anticipated at 60 tons per
month, while all-in monthly costs in sight
are not expected to exceed £1750.

Tin dredgers will prick their cars ,at the
news that Conrads, the Dutch experts in
this line, have patented inventions which, it
is said, will greatly simplify dredging opera-
tions. Details are not yet out, but the im-
provements. arc in big-capacity dredging from
great depths. Many expensive parts—and a
tin dredge is a whale for “spares”—have
been eliminated, and a big reduction in
power has also been achieved.

From a Broken Hill man in London—
Southern Rhodesia Base Metals Corporation is a
£150,000 concern formed to exploit properties in the
Lomagundi district. This month (June) its £1
shares touched £6 on a report by P. K. Horner
(a consulting engineer of high standing) that the
co. is the possessor of a zinc-lead proposition which
niay prove to be the most extensive of its class in
the world. A comparison is made with the Burma
Corporation’s property, but although the develop-
ments to date indicate something like 10 to 12
million tons of ore for each 100 ft. of depth, values
are not comparable. At a depth of about 150 ft.,
in a winze sunk from an adit, typical specimens,
according to Horner, showed copper ranging from a
trace up to 8.8 p.c., lead from 2.1 p.c. to 0.6 p.c.,
zinc from 8.1 p.c. up to 20.3 p.c., and silver from
1.20 z. to 2.20 z; per ton. As yet the properties are only
prospects, and two diamond drills are to punch
down. On present reports it looks a big thing; it
depends on the quality of the sulphides whether
superlatives will have to be brought into use.

lii mentioning Burma Malay, a new Syd-
ney tin co., it was said of Eric Mulligan, its
managing director, that he had been head

Wild Oat that Mulligan served under M. F.
G. Burrows.

“Eureka” : A while ago an advt. appeared
in several agony columns intimating that a
young lady in far-away Brazil with few
social opportunities was. prepared to journey
to Australia and enter into matrimony with
a lonesome Aussie bushman who could give
her a good home. She had read of the fine
HER MAJESTY’S DEFENCE

“Beauty is all a girl has to
fight with.”
“Then in these days roe will never he arrested for carrying con-
cealed weapons.”
qualities of the Anzacs and thought that
one of them would make an ideal husband.
Me would have to pay her passage over the
ocean, but if, after arrival, she did not
appeal to the taste of the bush gent, or
vice versa, then she was prepared to work
until she had refunded the passage money
in full. A nor-west Queenslander duly
answered the ad. and in a few months tnc
lady arrived. She came well up to his ex-
pectations, as did he to hers; but after the
gay Brazilian life to which she had been
accustomed, the loneliness was too much toi
her, and the agreement was called off so far
as the matrimony was concerned. She car-
ried out her undertaking, however, and
worked until the passage money was re-
funded ; and a while ago she set out for the
bright city life once more, leaving the Aussie
to liis dogs.
“P.A.Q.” : When Backhaus arrived in
Wanganui (M.L.) to give his recital, it was
found that his favorite Steinway concert
grand had gone astray during transit from
Auckland ; it’s quite easy to lose such small
articles as pianos on the M.L. railways.
Urgent wires were sent to W ellington tor a
spare instrument of the same brand, -tnis
should have arrived at 8 p.m. in time for the
show r , but, as usual, the train was late, in
desperation a baby grand was borrowed in
Wanganui and the recital commenced. V\ itn
two items completed, the Wellington piano
arrived, was wheeled on the stage and sub-
stituted for No. 1. The pianist had scarcely
warmed to his work again when a g'reat
clatter off-stage announced the arrival ot
the original piano from Auckland, it had
been taken off the train at Marton and
placed on a motor-lorry, which had become
bogged in flood waters. And Backhaus smiled

“Delos” : How’s this for a holida.v caravan
party? Recently in Lismore (N.S.W.) 1
came across it—a motor-car in which a
man, his wife and 10 children were doing a
four months’ tour of the State. The car had
a body longer than usual and an extra seat
placed between the original two. lhe back
scut provided accommodation for tour cliuti-
ren, the middle for four, and the front seat was
occupied by the man, his wife and the two
smallest infants. Luggage for the whole
family was carried on the footboards and a
rack behind. The owner told me that the
car had in two months carried this load
nearly 4500 miles without the slightest

“Camelero” : The romance that lurked m
those Christmas billies (B. y/8/26) v«'ealls
to me tlie shattered hopes ot Bluey Breen,
of the Camel Corps. We were bivouacked
at Mersa Matruh, in Egypt, when Bluey re-
ceived his billy, and when we were patrolling
a stretch of the Libyan Desert that evening
he confided to me that inside the dan he
had found a letter
from a bonder bint
who lived in Bris-
bane. “I want you
to answer that
letter," he said;
“I'm better at
pushing bullocks
than pens.” On
Bluey’s behalf I
corresponded with
the billy-girl for lb
months. Then I
stopped a bullet at
Gaza and bade
good-bye to Bluey
for many a long-
year. Before we
parted he assured
me that, although
i he girl had uot yet
granted his request
for a photograph,
lie knew she was
the only women he
could ever marry,
and when he re-
turned to Austra-
lia he was going to
buy the ring. A
few months ago 1
encountered Bluey
working in a bal-
last-pit at a N.Q.
railway - construc-
tion camp. Natu-
rally 1 asked if the

reply. “When I called to see her I found
she was 60 and the mother of a grown-up

“Gahl” : Are Melbourne people richer and
more self-indulgent than those of other Aus-
tralian capitals, or arc they merely more
snobbish? Despite the recent increase in
suburban railway fares, the high percentage
of “firsts” shows no falling off._ Aou are
much more certain of a seat during “peak
hours in the second-class. The figures tor
1924-26 are 73,003,000 first-class journeys
and 84,963,000 second-class, compared with
13,750,000 first- and 103,860,000 second-class
in Sydney. Brisbane totals for the same
period were 3,180,000 and 19,658,000 respec-
tively.
“P.X.”: It was an ex-policeman who laid
the foundations of this Referendum trouble.
Thirty-odd years ago, when Federation

THE GOODS IS THE WINDOW.
"But.darling. it shous your future so!”
“Well, [?] what's [?]ong with my liyuec?"
Pix ie, in South A us., where the smelting was
done, often had to sit by and starve while
the people over the border had their quarrels
out. Port Pirie got tired of starving, natu-
rally, and so did lots of other people in Soul: 1
Aus.: so when the Federal Convention met
in Adelaide they got J. H. Ilowe, who for
years had been member for the Port I me
district, to move that the Federation should
have power to deal with industrial disputes
where they slopped over a State boundary.
It wasn’t in the first draft; but Howe
buttonholed his old colleague John Hownei,
who was on the drafting committee, and
John persuaded Edmund Barton, who was
staying with him at the time; and the tiling
was done. Of course they never guessed that
in a few years inter-State “disputes” would
be manufactured in order to get them m
front of Higgins. J., who was reckoned a
softer mark than any State tribunal.
“W.J.T.”: “X.N.0.” (P>. l!>/8/’2(5) tells
us that a person jumping from a great height
will be dead from heart failure before he
reaches the bottom. Two people who had the
bad manners to throw themselves over the
Gap, Sydney’s popular suicide resort, have
been through my hands. A woman who ban
many hones broken was apparently dead
when picked up, but regained consciousness.
In the other case a girl jumped from the
highest point on the cliff and landed in the
water. She was rescued by a fishing-boat,
her injuries being nil. When aeronauts
jump from their machines with parachutes
the ’chutes sometimes don't open for many
hundred feet. Still the aviators land safely.
As to what causes the damage, the evidence
is therefore all in favor of that hard fact,
the bump.
“Lex” : A pending Melbourne divorce case
is likely to provide some thrills. A motor-
car driver was approached by a citizen .and
asked to pick him and a young lady-friend
up at a certain spot that night; he w r as also
asked to notice nothing, the request being
accompanied by a meaning wink. The motor-
man acknowledged the wink by asking his
prospective fare whether there was any
objection to him, too, having a lady friend
in the front seat. The fare could think of
none, and that evening the driver picked his
two passengers up at the spot agreed on.
A little later the company was reinforced
by a muffled lady who seated herself demurel>
alongside the driver. Presently the car
pulled up.at a bayside hotel, and the couple
in the rear seat entered its hospitable doors.
A minute later the driver and his lady fol-
lowed suit. They were shown into a room,
where the other couple were seated at a
table with glasses before them. The man
rose with a startled oath at their entrance,
and the driver’s lady companion let out a
shriek and flopped on the floor. The gentle-
man had recognised his own wife and she
him.
“Machete”: It would seem a far cry from
the British coal strike to the Australian
wine trade. Yet there is a link. A recent
trade report states that some time ago the
English coal-miners, finding the price ot
whisky had climbed
too high, took to
drinking Australian
port and burgundy
types, and soon
cultivated a taste
for them. The coal
strike entailed
economies whi c h
cut out the new
business, and the
consumption
dropped from
114,000 gallons in
June to 98,000 in
July. As the brew-
ers of Britain are
a 1 s o complaining
bitterly of a sharp
drop in beer con-
sumption, it would
seem th a t the
national life of the
Briton has been
more affected than
was supposed. And,
of course, that hits
Australia in a hun-
dred places besides
the wine trade.
For instance, the
oth e r day the
second of the two
big vehicle punts
which Sydney Fer-
ries has had built
in England pro-
ceeded to raise
steam. But posi-
tively coal enough
for the voyage to
S’Africa could not
be got in Britain;
all that the build-
ers could rake up
was eno u g h to
bring the ark along
to a port in Spain,
where Continental coal will be taken aboard
at a figure that will add some hundreds to
landed cost.

“Burralong” : A heavy downpour overtook

clay surmounted by a kerosene-tin chimney.
The wind whistled through openings m the

and there was just enough room in the place

of my acquaintance was a Chinese cook up

for the scene of his demise, and a douqle-
barrel shot-gun for the deed. To avoid
making a mess of the kitchen floor, he care-
fully wrapped a thick rug round his head,
and then inserted the gun in the folds and
pulled the trigger. When they picked lum
up, the rug was in a dickens of a mess, to
say nothing of himself, but there wasn t a
spot on the floor.

“Ouchulain” : While in Longreacli (Q.),
Lady Stonehaven lately christened the first
Queensland-built ’plane with the customary
champagne. The ’plane has been built by the
Quantas (Queensland and Northern Terri-
tory Air Service) Co., which has done such
sterling work in commercial aviation. Built
at the Longreacli hangar under the super-
vision of W. A. Bail'd (chief engineer), it
has a i!3O-h.p. Siddeley-Puma engine and
water cooler, with a cruising speed of 77
miles an hour. Queensland maple and three-
ply wood have been used for the body of the
’plane, a four-passenger craft. Lady Stone-
haven named her the Iris, and the G.-G. men-
tioned that he and his wife had booked their
passages with Quantas for their onward trip.

“Spare Corp.” : My own experiences of a
too-elose acquaintance with an exploding
shell were that there was little unpleasant-
ness in the shock itself, the immediate leel-
ing being one of calmness in wliat was natu-
rally regarded as your death hour; the un-
pleasant sensations came with the realisa-
tion that you were still alive. Once after
I had picked myself out of a mass of
mangled cobbers, a queer sensation that I
was really amongst the dead, and that I

was only dreaming that I was alive,. remained
for a couple of days. A couple of picturesque
descriptions were given me by Diggers in
hospital. “I was talking to a mate when
suddenly he changed into my mother, and
I wandered round the old home with her for
years and years, quite satisfied, although my
arm and leg were off, and reckoning myseif
luckv at getting out of the war so lightly.
Then, suddenly, I fell into a well, and
dropped for ages until I woke up in bed m
hospital and found I did have my leg and
arm off. I'd got so used to it in my dreams
during the seven days I was unconscious
that I didn’t seem to mind a scrap. Lne
other man was quainter. ‘‘lt was as it some-
one had turned the world into a bat and hit
me into the air. I kept going up and up
and up until I got proud of myself; l
reckoned I had learnt how to fly without
wings.” ‘‘What about coming down again /
I asked. “I didn’t come down,” he said.
“The shell blew me right into bed in hos-
pital.”

“Erua”: It isn’t only widows’ sons who
are liable to be captious about Mum’s suitors
(B. 20/8/’2(i) • There is in a Sydney suburb
a gay little widow with three grown-up
daughters who still wonders why her en-
gagement with an elderly solicitor came to
a sudden end four years ago. The explana-
tion of her lover’s insecure health never
really satisfied her, but failing any other she
had to accept it. She is still unaware that
her two eldest girls, determined young people
who disapproved of their mother s second
plunge into matrimony, called on the suitor,
and so forcibly impressed the poor man with
threats of future unpleasantness that ms
nerve gave way and he cancelled his date
with the lady, under strict promise ol secrecy
not to divulge the actual cause.

“Nakhoda” : The fact that Cobham is tak-
ing back with him a specimen from las-
mania of Anemone crasai folio, a plant that
grows on only three mountains in the world,
suggests u new job for aircraft. VN lien tm
Queen of Holland expressed a wish some
years ago to taste that most delicate frmt
of Java, the mangosteen, she was told that
even queens could not have all their avluiun
gratified ; and a prize of £3O, offered to tin*
first shipmaster who could bring this natural
sweetmeat to the Queen in a fresh condition,
did not overcome its tendency to rapid de-
terioration. When aircraft have cut down
the distance between countries by two-thirds,
a lot of unexpected treats may be anticipated
for the epicure.
“Basra”: I know a bit about the Meso-
potamian Arab that “Feng-Shui” and t>ol
Malaprop” have been discussing—he is the
gentleman who killed Cobham’s first
mechanic. I still carry the scar of a knife-
thrust presented to me by oue who was
endeavoring to relieve me of my rifle whilst
1 was peacefully dreaming. I have the knite
as an additional souvenir. The Mesopo-
tamian Arab is physically rather a fine speci-
men, and morally about the vilest creature
on earth. During the war the “Boodoos, as
the marsh Arabs were called, prowled round
the flanks of the army ready to loot and
strip the wounded at the slightest oppor-
tunity. They sniped our camps assiduously,
particularly at night, but dispersed into the
desert at the first sign of retaliation. A
favorite occupation was sniping river trans-
port. The Tigris has many hairpin bends,
and by a quick dash overland these sports-
men could sometimes get two goes at the
same boat. It was not quite so bad whilst
we were winning, but when fortune seemed
to have turned against us the Arabs re-
doubled their pestilent attentions. Towards
the end of 1916 rifle stealing had become so
serious that special orders were issued. It
was recommended that troops should sleep
with their rifles tied to their bodies, and
with the bolt removed. But the Arab did not

stop iit rifles: in fact, lie did not stop at
anything. He had no qualms about exhum-
ing the dead for the sake of the blanket and
the few scraps of clothing. I once set out
with a party of signallers, from Faluga, to
repair a break in the field-telegraph line.
The break turned out to be a gap seven
miles in length. The local sheik had lifted
the lot in one night. When the Hermans
were surveying the Berlin-Bagdad railway
they found it necessary to use concrete pegs,
because the wooden ones invariably dis-
appeared within 24 hours.

“A.11.A.”: The Prince of Wales knows
that fiddling with his tie (B. 19/8/’26) is
one of his besetting sins, but he can’t shake
it off. On the Renown in Australia he was
present when a film was shown in which he
appeared. On the screen he. saw himself con-
tinually thrusting up his hand to make sure
that his tie had stayed put. “I say,” lie said
to his staff, “I know I do that; but I didn t
know I was doing it all the time. Have to
stop it, now I see how it looks.’ There was
a subdued laugh at lI.R.H.’s half-humorous
earnestness —and up his hand flew again !

“Towser”: The loving couples in Royal
Park at the back of the Melbourne Zoo got
the shock of their young lives the other night
when a dangerous-looking striped creature
came loping with loud woofs out of the
shadows and disappeared amongst the trees.
Startled screams and oaths in deeper tones
cleft the peaceful atmosphere, and there was
a general stampede. One wild-eyed Romeo
rushed to a keeper’s cottage, and informed
him that the tigers had escaped; another
tore across to the near-by police station with
the same tale. A couple of johns hurriedly
armed themselves, and set off towards the
Zoo. Half-way across they bumped into a
knot of noisy youngsters in the act of remov-
ing a striped football guernsey from a big
panting dog!

“Mentha Pip” : A soldier can never afford
to go slow on a military order. For instance.
After Gallipoli the 3rd Brigade “rested” for
a few days at Sarpi, Lemnos. We were
weary and run-down troops, and the message
that H.Q. sent out to battalions one morn-
ing. “One pint bottle of Guinness’ per man,
to be issued by Army Service Corps,” was
received with the enthusiasm that it deserved.
Our Q.M., a wily bird, collected install ter,
and within 15 minutes the goods were dis-
tributed. Other battalions hung on, intend-
ing to issue the ale with the rations next:
morning. That was where they fell in. Om
hour later came an urgent message cancel-
ling the previous order and substituting “one
half-pint bottle per man.” It was too late
in our case.
“Hayle” : I don’t know if the Apollo Inn,
erected in 1841. is Melbourne’s oldest remain-
ing pub (B. 12/8/’26), but they must have
been fairly plentiful a couple of years before
that. An old volume of Victoria’s early his-
tory which I have before me records that in
the Melbourne of 1839 “stores were numer-
ous, but hotels wore in still greater abund-
ance. The Lamb Inn in Collins-street was
a roystcring place for shepherds with
cheques, while the Governor Bourke of
Michael Carr was likewise a place wherein
the hirsute stockman sat and rolled his
morsels of strong tobacco in his dirty hands
and stuffed it into his short clay pipe. Hard
by stood the sod-built hut for which a
license was held by Michael Pender, and
where his wife served the foam-mantled beer
across the rickety counter while lie himself
was busy on the roads with his bullock
team.” On the opposite side of Queen-street
the Royal -Highlander; kept by James Con-
nell. raised its dingy front of wattle and daub
out of the rocky pathway; and there were
many others. Indeed, it is recorded that
before the end of 1.839 Melbourne had no
less than 18 public-houses.
*** * ■
“Hamer” : Amongst the quaint signs the
memory of which I treasure was one posted
in every room of a boarding-house of Tai-
hape (MX.) when that town was the rail-
head of construction work on the Great
Trunk line, and, owing to an alliance between
the prohibitionists and the friends of the
pub-owners, had only two hotels for a
crowded population. The sign read: “Board-
ers are requested to wipe their boots before
going to bed.”
IN FREE SEPTEMBER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A parson in Queanbeyau has offered to conduct
weddings during September free of cost.”
Divine inspiration, this kind invitation
To all the creation of lovers and such
To come to the altar and lean on the psalter ,
Without need to falter the dreaded “How much?”
A wedding for backshees! Come, order the taxis,
And pull up your slacks (these refer but to Gus),
And powder your noses and ladder your hoses,
And sniff the fresh roses that wither for us:
For us, the angoras, who paid that our Floras,
Our Netties and Noras might rifle our - ■coats*
Might openly wive us and tyrantly drive us
And hurl at us divers such titles as “Goats!
That these, our dear darlings, our linnets, our star-
lings,
Might smash our best Barlings and hang on our
inos.,
And charm us by squalling and screaming and bawl-
ing
And stickily crawling all over our elo’es.
My Lovie and Dear Thing, arise, let a cheer ring
For one kindly steering the road to regret,
Lest yon in December look back to September
With nought to remember you’d like to forget.

A BALLADE OF MORAL MANNIKINS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A German planter named Eidelbaeh, who claims
to have discovered a tribe o 4 pygmies on the Ramn
River, in New Guinea, considers their standards of
morality superior to those of the ordinary natives.
Each man appeared to have only one wife.”
They are timid but amiable gnomes,
Four foot from their tops to their toes,
Who build Lilliputian homes
In fairly symmetrical rows.
Not over-addicted to clothes,
But still you can see at a glimpse
To love that is free they are foes;
And they live on bananas and shrimps.
They have chaplets of leaves on their domes,
The same for the belles as the beaus;
They are strangers to brushes and combs,
And soap, it is safe to suppose.
Diminutive arrows and bows
Are their weapons ’gainst raiders and crimps.
They are monogamistic as crows
On a fare of bananas and shrimps.
No midget Lothario roams
Where the Ramu sonorously flows;
No mannikin barrister foams
O’er the sins of respondents and coes.
They 'are constant, these Jills and their Joes
(Bohemia would reckon them simps),
To the soul-mates for wedlock they chose.
And their food is bananas and shrimps.
Envoy.
Have done with your scornful “what ho’s!”
They are dusky but virtuous imps,
Four foot from their tops to their toes,
Who live on bananas and shrimps.

THE NAPOLEONIC VISION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Yesterday afternoon Mr. Montague Cohen was
the guest of honor at a gathering at the Carlton
Brewery. Mr. Watt, M.H.R., said Mr. Cohen was 'a
Napoleon of the beer trade!’”- — Melbourne Sun.
I dreamed —and not the smallest doubt l have, from
what befell,
It was the oysters and the stout had cast on me
their spell.
As once a poet, poet-led through Hell’s grim misery,
Beheld the famed and fated dead and all there
is to see,
1, too,A ; .surveyed that tortured land, a molluse-
Virgil mine—
An Oyster held me by the hand and led me o’er
the line.
And at the heart of torment there, amid Cimmerian
gloom,
By Oyster-guide disclosed a vast Napoleonic Boom.
“Behold,” it cried, “the fretting ghosts of those
dull men have named
Generie’lly, and in their toasts as all but gods
acclaimed!
“Napoleons here of every sort that erst on earth
did rage;
Napoleons of Finance and Sport, of Science and the
Stage;
And, while within the glow they bask of that grim
name, no wit
It smoothes their dread, eternal task of living up
to it.”
A thousand thousand shapes I saw that strutted,
frowned and fumed ;
Like men god-raised above man’s law, strange
glories they assumed;
With fiery glance and pouted chest each strove —
’twsis clearly chronic;
l-ich struggled hard to pass the test and look
Napoleonic.
But one I marked —a furtive shade, forlorn, it
looked, and lost,
And none the least attention paid so diffident a
ghost;
So modest and o’erwhelmed it seemed amidst th’
imposing show.
All pitiful its -plight I deemed, and craved its
name to know.
“Ah, that!” The Oyster paused a space and combed
its straggling beard;
“Now, let me see.... Seems out of place....!”
Quite doubtful it appeared.
“1 thought each one of them I knew; but this —
so small and tame,
So meek and unimpressive, too—must be of minor
fame.”
Then slow a light upon it stole that made its green
eye dance;
“All, yes!” it said. “Why, that’s Napoleon Bona-
parte, of France 1”

PERSONAL
ITEMS
John Gunn received a set oration from
Attorney-General Denny on his last appear-
ance in S.A. Assembly. “The most popular
of all the State Premiers” was one state-
ment, and Kipling was 'borrowed from to
illustrate that Gunn could “walk with kings,
nor lose the common touch.” More moderate,
H. C. G. MACINDOE, Victoria's new Judge.
and fully justified, were the references to
‘•sincerity, courtesy and loyalty.... studious
and reflective by nature... .with judgment,
patience and sympathy.” Gunn is one of
nature’s gentlemen; possibly there never has
been a Premier in S.A. so popular—with his
opponents.
Functions involving speech-making are to
be cut out as far as possible when the Royal
Duke comes to Australia in May, 1927. He
lias not yet conquered the nervousness that
makes his speeches consist mainly of long
pauses.
While Federal Attorney-General Latham
is on the othei’ side of the world on League
ot Nations business he will have at least one
briet to keep him company—Melbourne Har-
bor irust v. Colonial Sugar Refining Co., a
dispute about land titles that goes to the
Privy Council. The fee marked on the brief
runs far into the four figures.
Though it is not made clear, apparently
John Garvan has retired from the Board
ot the Commonwealth Bank as well as from
the Chair. If so, there will be two vacancies
io fill; actually three, for the Governor is
also on the Board, and James Kell is not
seeking rcgazettal. When the directors were
first appointed, their terms were for from two
to six years, and they drew lots to distribute
them. Mackenzie Lees, formerly g.m. of
the Bank of Queensland, drew the two-year
slip and will retire in October, but as the
one practical banker on the Board he will
doubtless be reappointed.
To the list of casual Australians add Pre-
mier Allan, of Vic. Allan was to be sworn
in also as Minister for Railways. He turned
up 16 minutes late. It wouldn’t have mat-
tered so much

FRED
RIRRELL,
M.P., South
Aus.' new
Speaker.
Passed out at the age of 85, William E.
Parry-Okeden, after long and good service
m the Banana State. lie was born at his
father's station, Marranumbela (N.S.W.),
and educated at Melbourne Diocesan Gram-
mar School; tackled the law, but went back
to the land, joining his squatter father in
Queensland. In 1870 he was appointed In-
spector of Border Customs; in turn he be-
came P.M., immigration agent at Brisbane
and Principal Under-Secretary. In 1887 he
was one of the commissioners appointed to
inquire into the working of the Queensland
gaols; in 1894 he became district magistrate
under the Peace Preservation Act. and did
good work in the disturbed districts. He
was in harness as Commissioner of Police
during his later working years, but for some
time past had been living in retirement, one
of the most picturesque personalities of the
North.
Mrs. Bleazby didn’t manage to secure a
seat in Brighton Council (Vic.) last week
to enable her to continue the work her late
dad (ex-Premier Bent) had carried on for
years in that municipality while also help-
ing to run the State. Mrs. Booth, wife of
a doctor, got into Doncaster Shire Council,
winch rules an area contiguous to the metro-
polis. Mrs. Ross Watt, who is a councillor
of Gisborne Shire, was returned last year.
For some years Mrs. Mary Rogers (a Labor-
ite) was in Richmond Council, which rules
Melbourne’s nearest suburb, but was beaten
last year. Since ex-Premier Lawson, when
Attorney-General, had the law amended 12
years ago to permit the election of skirted
ratepayers, only the three named have had
a taste of municipal life. There have been
very few candidates.
There is a Maoriland Judge who agrees
with the Old Testament writer that off-
spring are an asset and not a liability. An
Auckland concern advertised for a caretaker
for its premises and appointed a married
man who had said in his application that he
had ‘‘no encumbrances.” Later on it was
discovered that the caretaker had a 15-year-
old daughter, and the company sacked him so
quickly that he wondered what had hap-
pened to him. An s.m. held that the care-
taker had been guilty of deception and dis-
missed his claim for damages. Stringer. J..
on appeal, granted damages in full, and in
his judgment laid it down that to describe
a child as an encumbrance is “preposterous.”
For the first time in its 37 years the
Broken Hill Prop, has a managing director.
When William Jamieson died, Essington
Lewis, the young Australian who followed
Delprat as general manager, was appointed
to the board and given the title of managing
director. Lewis was the first Australian
general manager: the big concern had pre-
viously had two Scotsmen (Wilson and
Stewart), two Americans (Patton and
Howell) and one Dutchman (Delprat). Most
times, by the Way, its underground manager
has been either a Cornishman or the son
of a Cornishman; its Broken Hill superin-
tendent for about quarter of a century has
been E. J. llorwood, who came out of Ben-
digo to the Melbourne Uni. and has been
on the staff for just on 35 years. The chair-
man nowadays is 11. G. Darling, a brother
of the late John, a former chairman. Essing-
ton Lewis, the managing director, got his
front name from the camp in the Northern
-territory which his father, John, explorer
and squatter, made his headquarters while
running the rule over the N.T. 40-odd years
ago.
Aviator Cobham takes away some con
fused notions about this country. The Coun-
cil of Churches in Melbourne passed a re-
solution accusing him of violating the sanc-
tity of the Lord’s Day by lobbing from the
sky oil to Essendon aerodrome on a Sunday
In consequence of this rebuke, and having
further learned that Adelaide was the 'city
of churches, the visitor informed that centre
that he would arrive on a Saturday. Adel-
aide promptly replied, in effect, that as the
police would be busy watching the spielers
on the racecourses, it couldn’t guarantee him
against a demonstration of affection similar
to the one that nearly destroyed him and
his mechanic in Melbourne. In desperation
the airman compromised by choosing for his
descent that hour of the Sabbath which falls
between morning church and afternoon
Sunday-school.
Major A. R. Selby, the youngster who goes
from Victoria Barracks, Sydney, to the posi-
tion of lecturer at Quetta Staff College,
India, is to get £l6OO a year—£loo more
than the salary of the premier position in
the Australian Military Forces; as Inspector-
General, Chauvel collects £l5OO.
Some early Melbourne history was mixed
up in the sensational motor smash at
Boulogne when Captain Richard Bars tow
llowey ended his life’s race amongst a pile
of crushed spectators. The Howey estate,
from which the young man drew his income,
was bought at Melbourne’s first land sale
in 1837, and comprises the richest soil in
Collins, Swanston and William streets. John
Howey, the dead speedster’s elder brother,
is also a racing motorist and holds the
world’s 10-mile record, made at Brooklands
last year. Both brothers served with dis-
tinction in the war.
Hand”: Watching the half-dozen Jap
legislators trooping into the public offices in
Melbourne the other day, the thought struck
rne that there must be some kinship among
politicians. They had the easy-going, slightly-
bored air of the out-of-office-temporarily-but-
am - sure -to-be - in - the - next - team legislators
whom we all know. One felt that after a brief
acquaintance he would not have much diffi-
culty in sounding them on the prospects of
next session and the possibility of shifting
the crowd in power. One thing I liked about
them: they were not fashion-plates, and if
they had forgotten their chimney-pot tiles
(reserved apparently for visiting) they would
have looked even better. To put on a top-
hat to visit John Allan, the despair of his
tailor, is really a joke.
Lieut.-Col. T. W. White, president of the
Vic. Aero Club, who arranged the recent
air pageant at Essendon, went to Mesopo-
tamia in 1914 with the first Flying Corps
unit to leave Australia. The unit was
equipped with old Maurice-Farnum ’planes
which had a way of petering out and leaving
the occupants in tight places. Once, when
flying behind the enemy lines, White was
forced to land. The engine had just enough
kick left to taxi along the ground at about
15 miles an hour, and that proved sufficient
to carry White and a companion right
through a Turkish bivouac unharmed. Dur-
ing the battle of Ctesiphon White volunteered
to cut Abdul’s telegraph-line. He did the
job all right, but the old ’bus refused to rise
again. The taxi stunt didn’t come off this
time, and two Australian airmen were cap-
tured by a Turkish cavalry patrol. After
a couple of years in captivity in Asia Minor
White was sent to Constantinople. In com-
pany with a British officer he escaped to a
Bolshevik steamer lying in the harbor. When
they reached Odessa they found the place
occupied by an Austro-German army, but
they kept going, and managed to reach Bul-
garia, which had just pulled out of the war.
Turkey did the same a week or two later;
the pair would have been saved a lot of
trouble if they could have foreseen that.
John W. Kirwan, who succeeds Edward
Wittenoom (retired) as President of Groper-
land’s Leg. Council, has been editor—titu-
larly, anyhow—of the Kalgoorlie Miner
since 1895. Actually his political activities
have occupied most of his time. He was the
first Federal M.11.R. for Kalgoorlie. sitting
as a Freetrader and follower of George Reid,
but when he sought re-election in 1903 the
division went Labor, and has remained so
ever since. Five years later Kirwan got him-
self returned to the State Leg. Council, and is
now entering on his fourth six-year term in
that capacity. Labor opposed him vigorously
at first, but became somewhat placated later
by his championship of goldfields interests,
and there was a period—before the conscrip-
tion split-—when he ranked as an as-good-as-
Labor man. The danger now is that the
seat will disappear under the next Redis-
tribution Act, but the same peril threatens
about five goldfields members out of six.
Kirwan is the fifth President since respon-
sible government arrived in I§9o. His pre-
decessors were George Shenton, Henry
Briggs, Walter Kingsmill (now a Senator)
and Wittenoom aforementioned.
“He’s [?]ing, isn’t he?”
“Yes, especially when he’s in his car.”

K.C., to retire from his job as a prosecutor
for the King in Vic.; for a while he was an
Acting-County Court Judge. If he hasn’t
shared the big prizes he at least has had a
smooth passage.
Lancelot J. Nesbit, who has just hung
out the sign _of the barrister and solicitor
in Adelaide, is a grandson of Paris Nesbif.
Adelaide’s one-time most picturesque and
gifted K.C. His father is a lawyer, too —
Iteg G., chairman of the Licensing Court.
New Norcia, the R.C.’s outpost in Austra-
lia’s North-West, has just lost its vicar-
general, Prior Castanares. Spanish born, he
joined up with the Benedictines, and was
later in charge of Minandao, in the Philip-
pines. When the niggers revolushed there in
1898 lie narrowly escaped a through ticket to
the New Jerusalem. After that lie came to
Australia and the comparatively safe spcietv
of Brown Brother. Of the original founda-
tion of seven, Death has left but tw r o. He
was only 55 at the finish.
There "was a time when the most familiar
feature of the Ellerslie racecourse (Auck-
land, M.L.) was the pink coat of old Tom
Brown, the clerk of the course. An offshoot
of yeoman sporting stock, Brown arrived in
the Shivery Isles from Lincolnshire in 1860,
and he was old enough to vote then. He
took up farming, and the Pakuranga Hunt
Club made him its huntsman, in which capa-
city he became well known to the squatto-
cracy. Hunting is in the family blood, and
a son. Wynn Brown, is master of the Wai-
kato Hunt. The old man went to the happy
hunting-grounds last month.
The right of ex-Treasurer McPherson to
have dealings with the Government through
the proprietary hardware company of which
he is head is being raised by Vic. Labor
party in the Assembly. When a question
on the subject was listed by Holland, of
Flemington, McPherson smiled gleefully. He
probably remembered that one of the largest
orders that ever came to his establishment
was given by the Prendergast Labor Govern-
ment. Somebody’s memory on the Labor
side must have slipped a cog, or the novice
from Flemington would not have been dele-
gated_ to put the query.' While members as
individuals must not tender or receive orders
for Government supplies, companies and pro-
prietary concerns of 20 members or more
are exempted by law from the ban.
One of the stories that cluster round the
memory of the late Walter Hall, the Jit.
Morganaire, relates to his attempt to get a
job as a Sydney ’bus-driver for an old col-
league of the days when Hall was a working
partner in Cobb and Co. This man had been
a particularly daring driver, of the sort
that would take a coach full tilt among
timber, missing the trees by half-inches.
But in Sydney his record was one of dis-
aster piled on disaster. He explained it to
Hall when he called on his rich friend to
say good-bye. “I’m going back,” he said,
“to where things stand still. In this town
every damned thing is moving.”


15 Months Ago
An Engineering Innovation
TODAY—the criterion all
others strive to follow
Fifteen months ago we announced
a revolutionary new-type motor-
car .. . the Overland “93” . . .
This powerful SIX was immedi-
ately popular and has now be-
come famous the world over.
This car embodies five years of
engineering research and success-
ful pioneering in new fields of
motor-car performance. At all
speeds it provides a new feeling
of stable - equilibrium ... A
pleasant sense of security at high
speed never enjoyed in any car
before. No side-sway. No slip-
ping. No wandering over the
road.
This car at its low price gives you
the beauty and performance of a
much higher-priced car with
greater economy of operation.
Full 40-brake horse-power de-
livered straight from the balanced
motor to rear-axle shaft. Im-
proved mechanical brakes. Bal-
loon tyres. Long, low appear-
ance. Fine finish. Unusual com-
fort.
There is no Six built to-day that
offers greater value ... or finer
quality of material or better work-
manship. In justice to yourself,
see this car. Drive it. You can’t
fail to appreciate it.

“Canty”: “Ruarie” (B. 5/S/’26) might
lose his faith in Mendel’s theory re the rela-
tive coloring of parents’ and children’s eyes
if he viewed our “first.” The mother and
I both have dark-brown eyes ; the new arri-
val’s are deep blue. I expected that a
change in color would occur; but after four
months he still stands as an exception to
Mendel's hypothesis.
“J. 8.”: If “Ruarie” (B. 5/8/’26) wants
to confront theory with hard facts he will
be welcomed at the address of mis writer.
A blue-eyed girl and brown-eyed parents live
there.
“Adelaide”: May 1 heave another brick
at Mendel's theory? My husband and 1 both
have dark-brown eyes. Six months ago my
fifth child was born, and her eyes are un-
mistakably blue. The older children have
very dark-brown eyes. The child’s paternal
grandfather and all his generation were blue-
e.ved and of Irish descent. Could not "Men-
del’s” term “recessive” apply here, though
his theory is disproved?
“Midford”: Touching the question of
whether fish feel (B. 19/8/‘26), that great
naturalist Frank Buekland somewhere re-
cords an enlightening experience of his own
when fishing in the Thames. He caught an
under-size perch, and in disengaging it prior
to throwing it back its eye was left in the
hook. Then the angler discovered that he
had no more bait, and idly threw in his line
with only the eye to tempt hungry fish. In
a few' minutes he had another bite, and duly
landed his capture. It was the same perch !
* * * *
“Jesmond”: I saw a peculiar fish netted at
Cowes (Vic.) recently. It had filled itself
with w r ater until it was almost a perfect
globe, about the size of a soccer ball. No
head or tail was to be seen, but the face was
almost human. The whole thing looked like
a whitish-grey balloon with a man’s face
painted on it and fins pencilled on the sides.
Before I could prevent him, a bystander
threw a stone with such force that it burst
the queer creature and scattered fragments
over the sands, so that identification became
impossible. What was it?
* * * #
“Black Tracker” : A flock of geese owned
by a farmer at Allandale (S.A.). headed
by two ganders, was in the habit of making
a daily flight to a small clover hill in au
adjoining paddock. This movement had been
noted by an observant fox, and a goose
breakfast suggested itself. Taking up a posi-
tion under cover in the early morning, the
slinker awaited the flock’s arrival. The
ganders from their lofty viewpoint spotted
their enemy in hiding. Without a moment’s
hesitation both, after issuing warning cries,
attacked with vigor. The savage onslaught
took Reynard by surprise and he tried to
beat a retreat. At this the ganders became
bolder, and one succeeded in getting a firm
grip on the enemy’s brush This enabled
his cobber to get a grip on the back of the
neck, and the strange spectacle of two en-
raged ganders hanging on to a struggling
fox was the sight that met the eyes of the
farmer when he arrived, attracted by the loud
cries of the birds. As the ganders, on the
man’s arrival, let go their hold, the fox dis-
appeared down a warren. The reception the
Hock gave the warriors on their return could
be heard a mile away.
"Spenner”: A Mumbaunar (Vic.) resi-
dent has just had a taste of what may be
expected from the fashionable craze of im-
porting wolf-hounds. He was feeding the
pack when a half-bred, a cross between wolf-
hound and grey-hound, considered quite tame,
flew at his throat. So fierce and persistent
were the attacks that both forearms of the
HARDLY A FAIR THING.
“I say, I refuse to judge the home-brews.”
“Why, what, on earth is the matter?”
“Well, Jenkins, the undertaker, has entered a bottle!”
victim were severely torn before assistance
prevented grayer injury. An ordinary tyke
may snap at a man, but it seems to be
instinct that prompts the wolf-breeds to
attack that most vulnerable spot the throat.
One shudders to think of the possibilities of
a few of these powerful brutes “gone bush” in
a pastoral area.
* * * *
“Coppertop": Whilst exploring Roberts
Plateau, a portion of Queensland’s National
Park, a tourist reports that he discovered
a luminous grass. He describes it as coarse
and with blades two or three feet long. A
bunch, when picked, had a sufficient phos-
phoric glow to light up the features of the
person holding it. When examined in day-
light the only indications of a possible cause
of the luminosity were tiny specks of white,
the size of a pin-prick, scattered over the
leaf. What name this pfeller?
* * * *
“Prop”: “Ajax” (B. 8/7/’26) says he
doubts if the genuine abo. can whistle. On
reading this I went into the kitchen to
Charlie, a Cooktown black, and asked him
“Can you whistle?” “Yes, Boss.” “Weil,
go to it.” But he couldn’t for grinning. I
told him to look at the cowyards and whistle.
He put one finger in his mouth, and let out
a shrill whistle as if he was calling a dog
from a long way. He then whistled with
two fingers between his lips, and finally
without any.
¥c * * *
“Rix”: “Th’ wust er these noochums,”
remarked my neighbor, “is th’ ’igh notions
some of ’em ’as. I'd one bloke as useter
part 'is 'air every mornin’, an’ seemed er bit
'uffy w’en I lent ’im th' mane-comb an’ body-
brush. Th’ nex’ chap ’ad ’igher notions still.
Wanted er bath —mind yer! ‘Wot d’yer
want a bath for?’ I asks ’im. ‘Look at me—
ain’t ’ad one fer 40 year, an’ I’m as strong
as ever I was.’ But I shows ’im where th’
dam was, an’ blast me if ’c don’t turn
round an’ say it wos er ’ot bath as ’e
wanted! ‘Look ’ere,’ says I, ‘if yer think
you’re goin’ ter turn my place inter a flamin’
’orspital yer can take your ’ook, quick an’
dirty!’ ”
“Runa”: There was something unique in
the way of wholesale slaughter in Welling-
ton (M.L.) recently whep seven fine lions,
all bred in captivity, were executed. Either
zoos or private fanciers could have got them
cheap, but the demand for pet lions is small,
and the zoos are well stocked up ; hence the
death sentence. The animals belonged to a
lady, and the upkeep of the seven cost her
over £5 per week. Few wild beasts breed
freely in captivity; there is never any trouble
on that score with Leo and his lady.
“Werrimee”: I once travelled with a
drover who never passed a bower-bird’s play-
ground or a dead emu without examining
it. In the playground he sometimes got a
coin or a trinket picked up by the birds
to ornament their bowers and to play with,
In one bower he found a gold ring, which
afterwards encircled the finger of a girl who
said “Yes.” The emu's remains also occa-
sionally panned out a coin or two, but more
often, in auriferous country, grains and little
nuggets of gold resulted from the post-
mortem. Any bright substance attracts emus
—even two-inch nails and boot pi'otectors.
“Mephisto” : It is commonly believed that
queen bees do not possess a sting. This fal-
lacy is traced to the fact that a queen has
never been known to sting man. She uses
her weapon for a more important purpose.
When the queen of a hive dies, or, the place
becoming overcrowded, she leaves with half
the bees, another ruler must be found. The
bees, therefore, feed some ordinary worker-
eggs on the mysterious “royal jelly.” The
larvae are then sealed up till four or five
young queens develop. The first arrival
stretches herself; then, sauntering round to
the other queen-cells, she stings the remain-
ing potential rulers to death, thus saving a
lot of dynastic trouble.
FOOD FOR THOUGHT.
ANGRY HUSBAND: “The quality of pudding
you make is awful!”
IRATE WIFE: “And the quantity of dough
yon make is worse.”
“ELM.”': Auckland Zoo got its first cur-
lew recently in a strange way. During a
football match on Carlaw Park a bird landed
among the players, and the referee stopped the
game to remove it. As it wouldn’t be shooed
off, it was taken charge of and recognised.
It had a broken beak, and was in an ex-
hausted state. Could it have flown from
Australia, or are there any of the species
known in Maoriland?

BILL GRUBBINS’S MATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mrs. Grubbiiis, gaunt and sallow,
Sat and wept for “pore old Bill,''
Who had gone to claim his halo —
They had laid hint “on the hill.”
On that day her husband, weary
Of his care’s and joys and sprees,
Had been “planted”-—ah, “pore dearie!”—
'Neath old Wombat's graveyard trees!
On that morn the Rev’rend Shaker
Prayed o’er Bill, who’d “travelled west,”
After which the undertaker
Sadly groaned, and did the rest ;
Aye, he groaned—'twas, maybe, knowing,
As he wrapped the earth round Bill,
That the exes, would stay owing-,
Grubbing’ assets being nil.
For Bill Grubbins, like most others
Who’d been fossicking through life,
Left no earthly goods, my brothers,
Save his humpy and his wife—
Mrs. Grubbins, and a hovel
Roughly walled with chock and log,
And a miner’s pick and shovel,
And a toothless cattle-dog.
So, alas, ’twas little wonder,
Widow Grubbins, sorrow-swept,
Groaned in desolation under
Old Bill’s humble roof, and wept;
For she'd neither child nor chickens
To console or see her through ;
And she wondered what the dickens
She could try and get to do.
Then the neighbors, quite a dozen,
Broke upon her solitude,
Led by Rev’rend Shaker’s cousin,
All in sympathetic mood;
And there followed at a distance
An old grizzled man and grey—-
.Just a swagman, whose existence
None had known of till that day.
Yet, although they’d hardly think it,
His (the stranger’s) name was Hayes,
Who with Grubbins found the Trinket
In old Wombat’s palmy days;
Ere himself and Grubbins shifted
Camp to other scenes afar,
Where they both went broke and drifted
Different roads—from Casey’s Bar.
A FINAL APPEAL.
"Try an get better, old girl, if it's only to nark me!”
Hayes'went south, Bill Grubbins nor’ward,
Seeking- still a golden vein,
But from that remote day forward
They had never met again.
Hayes tramped ever on, undaunted,
Seeking reefs and veins until
That dull day when Shaker chanted
The requiem of poor old Bill!
Thus it was he chanced to stumble
’Mongst that solemn crowd where he
Took a swift and hasty tumble
To their empty sympathy;
Then he shuffled past them, gamely,
Hardly knowing what he did:
“Missus Grubbins, ma’am—don’t blame me
For intrudin’ — here’s a quid!”
When again the spring dew., glistened
On the trees on Wombat Hills,
Passers-by oft paused and listened
To a woman's feeble trills.
And, although the voice was broken
That intoned the old bush lays,
’Twas of happiness a token
In the heart of Missus Hayes!

“It is cheaper and more effective. There is every prospect of it
being universally used, as every rabbit in the warren is doomed
Mr. Basil Wilson, of Tenandra, N.S.W., says:—
“No more digging out for us."
Mr. Howard Toes, of Warialda, saj's:—
“Where rabbits were in thousands before the Dust Blower wan

“I thought you said you could fight [?] wi[?] one hand lied behind

“So I can. I’m goin home to get a bit of string."
“Hannibal Swordfish”: The experiments
by “Cowes” (B. 5/8/’26) on the survival
of weed seeds subjected to heat are uncon-
vincing, as if the soil were “red hot for
several hours” all organic matter, including
the seeds, would necessarily be consumed.
Nevertheless heating a soil to even lOOdeg. e.
has very beneficial results upon its subse-
quent fertility owing to the destruction of
protozoa, minute organisms which feed
upon the soil bacteria. The bacteria or their
spores survive, and in the absence of such
check multiply rapidly ; and as some of these
organisms are concerned with the fixation of
nitrogen the nitrogenous content of the soil
is much increased. The protozoa may be
eliminated by the use also of volatile anti-
septics. such as toluene, carbon bisulphide
and others. Sir A. D. Hall, in “The Soil,”
states that if an antiseptic suitable for field
use should be discovered, an extraordinary
enhancement in the fertility of treated soils
may be confidently anticipated, as experi-
ments in the laboratory and on greenhouse
soils have been remarkably effective.

The leghorn is not going to lose his head,

“C.E.L-P.”: A correspondent in the
F.S.A. states that he landed in Sydney 68
years ago. His vessel brought a cargo of
New England white pine and a number of
llamas which were to be domesticated in
Australia. My correspondent wishes to
learn wliat happened to these animals. Pos-
sibly some member of the Abo. Council could
tell their story.
“Ouchulain” : A Bailie Creek (<,).) settler
recently had a fright lie will remember to
the end of his days.
Rowing home as
evening approached
he pulled his boat
in the bank, and
was in the act of
removing the oars
when a large croco-
dile held up its
hand as though to
signal his atten-
tion. The croc,
next reared his
forequarters out of
the water and rest-
ed on the side of
the boat, where he
gazed meditatively
at his potential vic-
tim. Then, as
tho u g h deciding
that the settler was
too tough, he
dropped back into
the water. This is
the first croc, seen
here for a great
length of time, and
there is one person
who won’t forget
the occasion. The boat was in imminent
danger of capsizing the whole time the mon-
ster was leaning on it.
* * ,*• *
“Forgeron”: Steel and iron do not get
“tired.” But being of crystalline structure
the former is particularly susceptible to ex-
tremes of heat and cold. Both steel and cast-
iron arc very liable to fracture in cold
weather or when working in cold water. This
often applies to a forging which has just left
the anvil. It is customary in steam-hammer
shops on frosty mornings to warm the dies
before use under the hammer. Other factors
may also be considered, such as looseness, the
wearing of the part to a thickness below
that required to stand the strain of the job,
bruising with a hammer, bolt holes too large
or in the wrong places, and so on. A brittle
condition brought on by extreme cold may
continue until summer, and the metal article
break then. A spell will have no effect what-
ever, the only solution being annealing, or
softening, by heat. Wrought-iron will often
break through sheer rottenness. In the case
of steel forgings and tools, the smith is often
to blame for quenching the job when it
should not be quenched, or in doing so in
very cold water or at too great a heat.
Cookies are often in such haste when having
a job done that the smith isn't given a chance
to attend to these details, lie “Valimanbag
and his asbestos-fisted Binghi farrier, 1 am
unable to express myself in terms used in
polite society. A white-hot shoe would have
a temperature of probably 1200 centigrade.
A shoe at this heat would take the foot off
any horse, and no man ever had a hand as
hard as a horse’s hoof.
“The Deacon”: The old-time cockies men-
tioned by "Borom" (B. 5/8/'26). who held
that crops planted at night at the full of
the moon did better than those produced by
daytime activities, also held the same idea
about tin' cutting of the hair. In a far west-
ern N. S. Wales district 1 once remarked
on the extra-luxurious skull coverings. of even
the oldest inhabitants. An ancient cocky
supplied the reason. “Alius cut yer 'air at
night when the moon’s at the full." Whether
this is right or not no one can say. but as j
science has proved that highly polarised light;
has a stimulating effect in making seed ger-
minate. there may be a tip in it for the
baldies.
“Centre” : Is there any timber safe from
the attacks of the shot-hole borer? I’ve been
told that the brutes
will not touch tal-
low wood, white
mahogany or im-
ported pitch pine:
but I’ve pro v e d
that they do. I’ve
been informed, also,
that the borer only
attacks timber that
is not properly sea-
soned. If that's
the case, it seems
impossible to buy
sawn timber that
is fully seasoned.
I’ve treated my
walls, floors and
furniture with half
a dozen much-
advertised borer,
exterminators, and
am now seriously
considering whether
or not to burn
what’s left of my
belongings. I’ve no
hope of selling any-
thing. How is it,
too, that the pest
is so much worse
in some districts
than in others ?
There’s a fortune
awaiting anyone who can discover a decoc-
tion that, applied to the sawn timber before
it is used, will make it distasteful to the
borer and his family.
“C.A.8.”: With reference to “Nitric’s”
statement (B. 5/8/’26) concerning springs
breaking out in the bed of the Condamine
River. I think it happens in dry seasons only.
In the Wellington (N.S.W.) district a cer-
tain Murrell Creek held water only in wet
weather. During the big drought of 24
years ago springs broke out in various parts
of it and the creek has never been dry since.
At times there is a depth of as much as 3ft.
of water which for purity and clearness is
rivalled by the waters of the Colo and Grose
only, and they are reputed to he the purest
in Australia.
“Kirk” : I don’t know the conditions gov-
erning the rising of streams in Queensland
(B. 5/8/’26), but in Tasmania with autumn
the creeks and small streams which have been
bone-dry through the late summer com-
mence to flow, and this is regarded as an in-
fallible sign of good rains soon to fall.
Farmers then push on with grain sowing
confidently.
“Specktonian”: The lady equestrian met
by “Bad Australian” (B. 22/7/’26) is not
the only resourceful bush mother. In the
northern Mallee (Vic.) I know a woman
who has three kiddies, all tiny, and who
has no means of getting about the district
other than horseback. She has two bran
bags sewn together, with a small hole in the
middle of each. A youngster is put into
each bag, and pokes his head through the
hole for free air and observation. The two
bags are then slung over the front of the
saddle, and when Mum mounts she puts
the third kiddie in front of her.
* -X- * *
“Eureka”: Why is it that the stringy-bark
of the South Coast of N.S.W. is not a suc-
cessful fencing timber when used in another
district? Posts sunk in the locality where
they were cut —the Bega-Eden district—have
lasted many years and proved superior to
any other native timber, but. when stringy-
bark posts of the same quality are used in
Monaro or any other district they rot and
split in a very short time. Some put in at
Bibbenluke station rotted tiff after only 12
months in the ground ; yet the soil appeared
,to be the same as where the trees had grown.
“M.G.S.”: Melbourne residents were sur-
prised at the unanimity with which the first
American massed tour automatically de-
manded a platypus. A pilgrimage to the
museum to see a stuffed example was all
that could be offered to the visitors. The
next multitude that arrives, however, may
be able to watch the queer creature in its
habit as it lives. F. ,T. Rae, the new director
of the Botanic Gardens, proposes to stock
Bis beautiful lake with them. Experience
elsewhere in Vic. has shown that they thrive
splendidly in semi-captivity.

“Larrapiuta” : Apparently the IHnus
insignia does not deserve all the hard things
said about it. Professor Chapman (Adelaide
Uni.) has found that in tensile strength,
breaking and crushing strains it compares
very favorably with oregon. A small mill
at Clare (S.A.) is cutting insignia planted
on the Hill River estate 40 years ago, and.
although the pines have never been lopped
or cared for, the timber is singularly free

“No."

from knots and is quite straight-grained
and strong as Oregon. Most of the pines are
100 ft. tall, with a Oft. girth, so that two 30ft.
logs can be cut from them. The Douglas fir,
or Oregon pine, grows equally well, and it
is difficult to understand why it is not more
extensively planted. The Peter Waite estate
at Urrbrae, near Adelaide, has a. border of
30-year-old insignis and Oregon pines planted
alternately, and the latter have outgrown
the former by 20ft. and have much cleaner
stems.
HAND-OUTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, the feeds we hummed from the “babbling brooks”
away where the Outback broods!
The tales we told at kitchen-doors in tune with a
good cook's moods!
The hunks of beef' in gunny bags, and chunks of
mutton chops!
The shanks and flanks and odds and ends we hummed
in butchers’ shops!
These were the feeds that made life good and
shortened the endless miles
When our stomachs thought that our mouths had been
wiped out of our dust-lined dials.
The tracks were dead and the bushland dull when
our innards nagged for scran,
And the world looked worse than a shoddy job, and
set to a rotten plan.
The sun-dance glared in our sweat-stung eyes and the
trees were out of plumb,
And even the best of mates has faults when luck
turns sour on the hum.
The pads were hard and our boots too soft and a
squattah’s plain “Good day”
Was only tire grunt of a well-fed hog that jarred in
a nasty way.
But the dirt-brown towns were cities grand, and the
river bends were glades,
When a mate unrolled a wad of grub and tales of
the hotel maids.
The hundred miles we meant to make was only a
few days’ stroll
When the fronts of our backs were puffed a bit, and
our belts let out a hole.
And no grand gorge a. gun shed-cook spread out in
the shearers’ mess
Could line our tripes like the hand-outs did or
comfort our emptiness.
Oh, the nice roast beef on clean white plates we
“picked” in the flash hotels
When our luck was in at the two-up schools and we
posed as leisured swells,
Or the steaming duffs and the great sea-pies in
the rougli-up mustering camps,
Had nothing much on the feeds we hummed when we
were “awful” tramps.
(And. often we danced, and sat out, too, with some
of the maids we stung,
And lied and laughed when they “thought we’d met”
-—then talked of the sheds we’d rung.)
Oh, those who peek at their routine meals and eat
by the ticking clock,
And cranks who fast when well cashed up can read
and take the knock—
They do not know the joy supreme that starts with
a tale well spun
And all too full of the plain, blunt truth that men
of the sham towns shun,
And a hand-out feed in an emptiness so vast you
can feel the thud—
So vast, you wish for hollow legs, and hanker to
che w the cud!
QUEENSLAND.

SILK
STOCKINGS
, A large section of Sydney i.s absorbed by a
single thought-—to raise the Cancer Research
Fiunl to the hundred-thousand mark. Every
afternoon party swings into a discussion of
the campaign. On ferries women proudly
recount the number of envelopes they have
addressed and the stamps they have sold.
The cost cf the printing of the campaign
stamps, by the/way, was borne by A. C.
Godhard, and he and his wife (she was the
efficient Mona| Daley, of the Crown-street
Women’s Hospital) are working nine solid
hours a day qn the big job. Jew, Gentile,
feminist and futurist are raising money by
jazz, mah-jongg, bridge and poker parties.
Amateur actors and actorines are appearing
to bumper houses in the cause, and to such
proportions did one flutter swell that the
Carlton, which housed it, had to disguise
sonic, of its bedrooms as lounges to accommo-
date the card-tables.
One North Shore line woman who decided
at the eleventh hour to attend the Green Hat
cabaret last week showed ingenuity. A
green hat being essential to admission to
the Wentworth, and this lady owning no
top-piece, of the slpide, she, even as Eve,
walked in her garden. Here -she plucked
some lettuce-leaf, a cluster of laurel leaves
and some long spring grasses. Of ' the let-
tuce-leaves she formed, the brim, the laurel
leaves made the crown, and the spring grasses
a soft green plume to fall over the right ear.
let this back-to-nature effort did not win
the first prize—only a special. However,
its originality was praised on every side'
and the saxophone and the horns wailed a
special bar or two of “In Your Green Haf’
to greet the wearer. Apart from the color
of the millinery, the cabaret went the way
of all such popular afternoon brews. Anil
the Kindergarten Union takes the profits.
The Red Indians from the Prince Edward,
Eva Novak on ticket of leave from “The
1 enn of Mis Natural Life,” Anne Seymour
from the Tivoli, knight Mungo MacCallum
from the I ni., Bertie Kelly and Dan Carroll
were a few of those who hurried down the
stairway of the Ambassadors to the Movie
7?. ,P u * y s * lot by the camera-men in the
I aim Court, they were charged by the attend-
ants in the cloakroom, and what was left of
them staggered on to the dancing floor for
the benefit of the Day Nurseries. The small
red-pinnied inhabitants of the kind hostels
might easily have turned a puzzled gaze could
they have seen the grown-ups’ idea of the
helping hand. Of course there was a pageant
ot movie heroes and heroines, the Red
Indians flung a frantic dance through some
war-whoops, Eva Novak shook a red-gold
mane aboye sunset georgettes, cameras kept
up a running fire, and Professor MacCallum’s
indy added sober thoughts in Rookwood
black-and-silver. Mrs. Norman Dawn,
wife of the movie potentate, covered her
ivory and gold crepes with the fashionable
ensemble coat as thick with green and gold
as a general in the army of the Irish Free
►state. . Margaret Osborne, as pretty and
expensive-looking as usual, shed lustre on
the dance, and Mrs. Morven Nolan, of Leura,
was another who drew a second glance.
There’s something in the seaside air all
right! Consider the achievement of the
seven girls from Manly who decided three
mouths ago to help the Returned Soldiers with
tbe local memorial hall. They call them-
selves -the Younger Set, but they haven’t
much to fleam j„ the art of collecting.
Already they had some hundreds of pounds
in tlie_ savings bank, and the ball they spon-
sored-last week should give Cr. Bal. an over-
i lie-moonisli feeling. The Wentworth flashed
a smile tor the occasion, and the Viking and
lus lady, supported by Captain Coote, lent
their presence. Lady de Chair smiled above
emerald-green velvets on the baker’s dozen of
debs.,- who looked like an inspiration for
Mendelssohn s Spring Song in their white
and silver georgettes and lace, with daffodil
posies. The Mayor of Manly brought his
Mayoress, and in one group the United King-
dom was represented by Mrs. England, Mrs.
.Scotland and Mrs. Ireland. A poster dis-
play and the Dolly Varden hats woven of
rosebuds that coyly crowned the committee
it'T Were otler notabl e events of the even-
The best-dressed women in Svdnev crowded
t hrough the doors of the St. James on Satur-
day tg call on Mercenary Mary. Gorgeous
cloaks in gold and metal-brocade and laco
passed with slow elegance up the stairs. A
coat: of: cobalt-blue splashed with silver did a
swallow dive to the stalls, accompanied bv
an important affair of cherry-velvets and
nnuk One tall unknown but not unobserved
went her serene way, her pale gold hair worn
in lit tie flat car-braids above white moires
of noble birth and expensive cut. These were
only half revealed under a cloak of black and
gold which wore white hyacinths on its right
shoulder. Altogether a sumptuous gathering
to tread the velvet carpets and inhabit the
adorably comfortable chairs in their old-rose
and gold upholstery. But, oil, the unutter-
able dreary desert of that first act!
Daffodil matineers on Monday afternoon
described the performance at Sr. James in aid
ot the Australian Mothercraft Sociotv as a
thoroughly sound and invigorating' affair
Stars burst on and oft the stage with an
e loct that was positively dazzling. Dion
Boueicault put forward his best art in Rob-
<ri Louis Stevenson's “Fragment,” and his
leading lady, Angela Baddeley, decanted an
old vintage of English folk songs from a
' * e |j.t early-Victorian hoops in white
taffetas, the tamily-loeket effect being height-
ened by a tight little posy of red roses. Renee
Kelly, too, with her enviable husband, and
Hyitou Allen were applause-bringers; and
Stephanie Deste and Arthur Greenway—
these and others, that the babies of Ivari-
taue might drink according to Trilby King,
and not as laid down in the quaint advt.’
tor somebody’s Bitter Ale in front of the
programme. The pictorial effect of jtlie
afternoon was -achieved by .Tack Cannot
At the end of the d.c., -with a look of
brooding motherhood in his eyes, Jack
cradled in liis arms a basket of daffodils
threaded with baby-blue ribands in which
reposed a toy white pom. more like a poivder-
than anything else. At least three
Maorilanders, two of them from Dunedin,
where Trilby King- has his home, were among
tffe workers who chivvied the venture to the
i.)00 mark. The trio were Justice Danger
Owen s wife, Mrs. John Fuller and Mrs.
Dundas Allen. Chief-Justice Street’s wife
was president of the committee.
There was a sergeants’ mess in the left
wing ot Victoria Barracks when its brown
stone Avails were quite young; and, with
the accumulated glory of the years behind
it, a Garrison sergeants’ annual ball is a
tremendous affair. Held in the main drill
hall the other night, the decorations, done by
the men themselves, were aw II on the pro-
fessional level. Each AvindoAv was a lattice-
work of roses; and flags were mostly used
as a background. The orchestra, in the centre
of the floor, diA’ed into a bower of blooms,
and gaily-tinted lanterns sAvung over a kind
ot Arabian Nights’ entertainment. Warrant-
Officers Russell, Kaglnnd and Taylor were
the sergeants' executive responsible for the
arrangements, which included a sit-down sup-
per like a Lord Mayor's banquet.
. They are not all born in Russia Avho dance
in a Russian ballet. When the pretty crea-
lure in tlie
picture along-
side appeared
with Serge
D i a gliileff’s
London com-
pany in 191 -
-19. she was
billed as Miss
Olkhiua. But
•she was born
a t Military-
road, Mosman,
21 years ago,
and was duly
christened
Laura Wilson.
Laura began
to train in
Australia for
her career
when she was
little more
than a baby,
~. , , and m June of
tins year she was featured as principal
dancer for the royal opera season at Covcnt
Garden, the opening opera being “Thais.”
Other successes gained by the Australian
Mere her appearance in the “Midsummer
Aights Dream” ballet at Drury-lane, and
as instructor and producer in the Glaston-
bury Festival School. Her family are settled
now at Oxford Downs, in North Queensland.
“A.G.M.’s” note from London:—-
Not for many a year lias there been such a
succession of brilliant entertainments as those given
this year in honor of the King and Queen of Spain,
both immensely popular in Loudon. That of the
Duchess of Sutherland on the eve of the Spanish
Sovereign’s departure was unusually diverting-.
Dancing- was in the garden, where a floor had been
laid on the tennis court. Supper tables were set
round in the open air; most of the guests wore
fancy dress and masks; and the most hilarious of
the surprise features was the entry of a boat with
a picturesque crew. This fantastic party included
Lady Ednam, Lady Loughborough (who got her
divorce that day), Mrs. Dudley Ward and Mrs.
Lionel Tennyson, all of whom have intimate associa-
tions with Australia. They were dressed in -white
“shorts” and sweaters with caps and oars of pale
blue. The Queen of Spain did not wear fancy
costume, but aroused great admiration in a dress of
silver tissue, with a wonderful Spanish shawl and
ropes of pearls. The Prince of Wales, who loves to
“dress up,” changed his character three times during
the evening.
It isn't every city that can secure a Royal
personage to glorify its wares; but Manches-
ter has done it. As her tour will prevent
the Duchess of York from attending Man-
chester’s Textile Exhibition, as she had hoped
to do, the city is offering H.R.H. a wide
range of fabrics in her favorite colors to
dazzle the bunnies at Canberra.
John Garvan’s home-coming by the Aor-
angi won’t be a gay one. When he'left Sydney
a few months
ago you would
easily have
picked him out
as one of iho
li 11 es t men
physically and
mentally in the
big- business
world of Aus-
tralia. He set
go high a value
on physical fit-
ness that a
few years ago
he actually pro-
posed to move
the office of
the life-insur-
ance office of
which he is
head and set
it up in a
suburban gar-
den, whe r <;
the staff could tumble out from its desk into
tennis courts or cricket field : it was the staff
that saw difficulties in the way. Going
through Canada en route to Europe he was
struck down by illness, and for weeks lay
very seriously ill at Montreal. His friends
hoped that he would come back quite recov-
ered ; but they felt that things were not
what they should be when they learned last
week that, though he has greatly improved,
he was on the way home attended by a nurse
and his old friend and medical adviser, Pro-
fessor Mills,
To hoary old St. John’s, of Darlingliurst,
Sheila Futter brought her ivory satins and
Brussels lace the other night. There, being
questioned on behalf of Dudley Campbell
Body, of Inver ell, she said the word which
Padre E. 11. Stammer, listening-in, declared
made her that young man’s wife. Bride’s
sister, Mrs. Leslie Bray, and Nell Body added
color to the picture, the first in sea-blue taf-
fetas, the tulle veil that covered her locks
flowing free from a silver bandeau, while
the second maid got her effects from old-rose
georgettes, with an accompanying tulle top-
piece. The whole Avas served to the fragrant
murmur of banked-up lilies and tall pink
stock, and a reception followed at Mrs.
Leslie Bray's flat in Elizabeth Bay.
Mollie ShaAv. the blue-eyed, golden-haired
niece of Bose Scott, was married in London
last week to a distinguished American
scholar, Jules Menken. The ucavs of the
engagement came in one of the last letters
Rose Scott received from the girl she had
mothered after her sister Mary died—-Mollie
was the only child of that sister and the late
Canon Shaw of Singleton. The wedding took
l'lace at St. Clement’s Dane, and a Mel-
bourne girl, Cliaive Collisson, Moliie’s chum,
and a brilliant student known to American
and English Unis., gave the bride away.
Mollie ShaAv always worshipped scholastic
attainments, and perhaps her Canon father
m Heaven directed the hand that allotted
her a scholar, instead of carelessly pushing
her a pugilist or a tennis champion. Her
husband is a doctor of philosophy and a
professor of economics. He was the exchange
American student for the Denmark Uni.,
under the U.S.A. Returned Soldiers’ Scholar-
ship system. Thence he Avas sent to Cam-
bridge. and there also plucked a handful of
honors. The two met Avhile studying at the
Columbia University (New York) ; Mollie
Avas secretary at the Vanderbilt X-Ray In-
stitute in that city.
I here is news from London that the AvidoAv
of George Long-Tunes (she Avas Thelma
MacQuade) is venturing into matrimony a
second time. Her groom-to-be is Clive, the
youngest brother of her first husband; and
the wedding is to be in November.
From the Speck :
Most of the women’s societies have been saying-
good-bye to Sister Daisy Richmond, who has been
superintendent and organiser of the bush-nursing-
scheme and inspector of the State's maternity
hospitals. She holds practically every certificate it
is possible for a nurse to get; her war service brought
her a Royal Red Cross—the nurses’ V.C. Better
than all, she is beloved by the out-back nurses -who
served under her here. She has become matron of
the hospital at Wollongong, to be near her aged
parents. #
The Gran brook ftffe committee is out after
its usual thousand. Last year this was the
result of an afternoon's labor, and the hunt
before that netted the same sum. This
spring’s effort expects to cut a similar slice
off the debt on the new playing-fields, and
September 25 and the Cranbrook oval are the
lime and place sot aside for the operation.
The Players’ Club promises great things
from its raid on Tchelchov’s “Cherry Orchard”
on September 16 and 17. The part of the
man with the tongue-twisting name, owner
of the orchard, is being played by Wynne
Whear-Roberts—the. club will be above sus-
picion as regards the pronunciation, as there
is a real Russian girl in the cast. The ver-
satile Francis Jackson is producing and also
playing the part of an aged retainer. The
audience is requested not to forget its hand-
kerchief.
Sydney smiling across the Pacific lures the
artistic of all countries. A theatre enthusi-
ast, Alfred Gordon, a Russian Pole, threw
up his two-pronged feeding fork —he was
head of a school of histrionics and actor at
the State Theatre at Dusseldorf —and made
for this city two years ago. At that time
he knew a few words of English : now he is
busy rehearsing the Shakspeare Society for
a production of ‘‘Hamlet” in October. This
presentation should be of great interest, as
Mr. Gordon is working on the lines of the
Hamlet of Professor Max Rheinhardt, of
Berlin, who is l steeped to the fingers in the
86 different translations that his country-
men have made of the bard. No amateurs
and few professionals have been trained as
hard as the girls and boys in the October
cast. Every night since the beginning of
July, including Saturdays and Sundays,
there has been a rehearsal, and, leaving no
loophole, two companies are in harness, com-
plete _ from Hamlet to grave-diggers. This
doesn’t seem anything to an actor-manager
who faced a change of programme every
night in the Dusseldorf theatre and two pro-
grammes on Saturdays and Sundays, besides
the side-line of morning lectures and after-
noon classes. At the recent Shakspeare
birthday celebrations in the Great Hall of
the Uni. star events were scenes from
“Hamlet” and “Julius Caesar” by this extra-
ordinary man, who two years ago could not
have formed a complete sentence in English.
Already the Russian ballet has struck its
roots in Sydney. Alexis Dolinoff, who was
one of the principal male dancers with Pav-
lova, has put up liis sign in Pitt-street. The
young man will be remembered as the Arca-
dian Shepherd who partnered Thurza Rogers
o' Pastoral, and was the bass to Anita
Stewart’s treble pirouettes in Voices of
Spring.
Miss Brisbane’s account of northern frivols:
It was a good advertisement for Jeanet’te Etliel-
stone s pure soprano that the audience for her second
concert was double the size of the roll-up for her
first. Both concerts were in His Majesty’s, and the
difficult numbers were sung in the effortless fashion
which is one of the young Mackay singer’s many
good points. A beautiful boomerang of sweet-peas
was one of many tributes laid at her feet.
Among the teas given to bride-elects last week
was one for Everil Merson, where, in a setting of
Iceland poppies, Jean Gross spread the tray-cloth.
For Leila Norton another was arranged by Violet
and Clarice Couldery, amid sweet-peas, at Moray-
street.
lor the funds of Nazareth House the Catholic
Tennis Club had a dance at the Belle Vue. Blue and
red veiled the lights and Iceland poppies did their
bit for the supper tables, amidst puffings of pink
tulle. Emmie Stewart’s band played.
Stuart Stephenson gave a talk on “Literary
Wanderings” at the Women’s Club. Nell Storey
presided, and Mabel Zillinan arranged the programme,
in which Alison Craig and Fdith Langham were
musical.
The Army Sisters have had a party at the National.
The studio was be-ribboned, and the cardroom housed
the supper tables, decorated with sweet-peas and
African daisies. E. M. Paten, in henna crepe de
Chine, gave the glad hand to the guests.
Dr. Jean Wliite-Haney gave Mrs. L. O. Lukin a
bunch Of red roses at the Lyceum Club. Mrs. Lukin
is one of the foundation members. Dr. White-Haney
wore mauve, the guest of honor sage-green, and
daughter -Beryl fawn.
Quite a lot of summer frocks turned out to see
Tattersall’s Cup run at Ascot. Mrs. E. K. Tully
chose golden-brown crepe de Chine; Marie Massey,
frilly wljite and blue organdie; Sheila Mcßryde,
white Indian : cfepe; Iris Buchanan, bottle-green.
Mrs. IV. j. Hooper and Mrs. W. 11. Buchanan were
amongst those who had tea parties on the committee
verandah. ' The Lieut.-Governor and the Isaac Moores
were amidst the crowd.
E. Taylor’s private green saw the official opening
of the Balmoral Ladies’ Bowling Club. Royal blue
streamers were stretched athwart the lawn, and brass
bowls of red roses dressed the tea tables under the
marquee.
The Buchanan-Steeles had an Oriental dance at
their home. Bowls of ripe oranges were amongst
the decorations, with a model of the Sphinx and
many gay Eastern lanterns, while the guests had to
take supper sitting cross-legged on divans and
cushions on the floor, and brass bowls of violets and
silver vases of carnations supplied the perfumes of
Araby. The hostess was a Snake Charmer and Dr.
Steele a Chinese gardener. Mrs. Frank Cowell, as
Pearl of the Harem, won first prize.

The air at the Playhouse last week was
thick with brogue and Milesian music when
Synge’s “Playboy of the Western World”
was put on by the Repertory Society. Mrs.
Elizabeth Apperly, who lias played Pegeeu
Mike with the Abbey Players of Dublin, was
responsible for the performance, and
appeared in her former role. An audience
at first more or less bewildered chortled at
last over the surprising transitions from tra-
gedy to comedy and back again, and a suc-
cess was achieved. Flowers and gifts were
passed over to the two leading ladies, Mrs.
Apperly and Ruby May, and even the bare-
footed colleens received some floral reward.
On the first night the Norman Simpson
couple, Dr. Frank Apperly, Lilian Cassidy,
Helton Daniell and his wife and Mrs. Apple-
ton were seen. So things went on until
Saturday, the last night of the show. Then
a young man rose in his place and protested
that the play was a libel. The interrupter
was helped out; and half a dozen sympa-
thisers went with him. There was much
hooting for a while—whether at the play
or the interruption wasn’t half so clear as
it should have been.
The Japanese Parliamentarians found
welcome and tea at Palmyra, the Toorak
dwelling of Dr. James Barrett (president
of the Japan Society) and his genial lady.
Rain, which fell in sheets, dimmed some of
the lustre of the occasion, since the fine gar-
den could not be shown off, nor could the
guests be even formally introduced to the kan-
garoos and other native animals which the
knight cherishes and harbors, and which he
delights to exhibit to visitors from afar.
After a handshake in the library, the party
repaired to the drawing-room, dressed up in
peach bloom and orchids, where a string
orchestra made pleasant sounds. The pic-
tures painted by Palmyra’s chatelaine came
in for attention and admiration. The Mc-
Bcath knight, who was there as Melbourne’s
Consul for Japan, and M. Tokugawa, Nip-
pon’s Oonsul-Ceueral for Australia, body-
guarded the guests, who gripped British
hands with manly vigor. Two little Japanese
ladies, wives of Melbourne merchants of their
own nationality, were invited. One, a bride
of a couple of months and unable yet to
speak English, smiled approvingly upon
everything. The other Japanese matron ex-
plained that, though the almond-eyed lass
had only just laid aside her national dress,
she preferred the European styles. The
hostess, who wore a gown of black velvet
with some old lace, was helped by her daugh-
ters : Cara, who.se nigger-brown coat-frock
had additions of leopard-skin; Bertha, in
apparel of nutmeg hue; and Jeanette, with
grey fur bordering soft blue raiment. The
Mcßeath and Henuessy ladies and Sylvia and
Valerie H'ennessy, University Chancellor Mac-
h arland, Professor Jollie Smith (secretary of
the Japan Society), Director of Education
Late and Mrs. D. ,T. Gans and her daughter
Nell blessed the entente with their presence.
There was frost in the air on Friday, and
later a breeze keen enough, one would have
thought, to discourage the bravest heart
among M attle Day workers; but they were
not downhearted, and 1000 collectors
scattered among 30 stalls gathered well
over £4OOO to help the free kindergartens
mi °th er good works on behalf of children.
Though wattle was the chief merchandise,
there were jams and cakes and the like to
tempt those who believe it’s unlucky to take
wattle into the house. And a sight worth
seeing was the gorgeous display of daffodils,
narcissi, violets, heath and such, which turned
the window space of a Collins-street em-
porium, lent for the occasion, into a blaze
of glory.
The Children’s Hospital flouted precedent
by attempting to extract £85,000 from the
pockets of the public without engaging a paid
organiser, and the fact seems to have made
collection easier. At the 57th annual meet-
ing of the institution, his Ex. in the chair,
it was announced that all save about £9OOO
had been raked in. The hospital started in
1870 with only six beds, in a house now
demolished in Exhibition-street, next door to
Admiralty House. To-day there is cot accom-
modation for 250, and the weekly total of
outpatients averages 2250. President Mrs.
1 -auchie Maekinnon, a symphony in hydran-
gea blue, introduced the Governor, who
showed he knew a good deal about hospitals
—and then promptly went off to learn more.
Tea and cakes were dispensed in the big out-
patients’ hall, which tempered its drastically-
disinfected atmosphere with a wealth of plum
and peach blossoms. In the army of hard-
workers for the Fund, none has been more
enthusiastic than Walter Kirby ; a grateful
Board has made him a Life Governor.
President Mrs. 1 >. A. Skene, treasurer Mrs.
H. Fosett and Mrs. Thomas, who were at
the recent conferences of women’s organisa-
tions in Brisbane, gave an account of their
experiences to the National Council of
W omen at the Queen’s Hall. They were full
of praise for Brisbane’s hospitality, and
raised hallelujahs over the new Town Flail
which will cost £BOO,OOO by the time it is
finished. Also they found a children’s play-
ground which they reckoned the most perfect
thing of its kind they had ever seen.
The year’s tally of cases dealt with at
the Eye and Ear Hospital was 47,187 —this
includes both in- and out-patients. The
report mentions the success of the appeal for
£30,000 needed for additions to the institution.
Building operations are in abeyance while a
question of site is being settled.
That stern Scot Colonel Davidson, who
secretaries at State Government House, is
busy these days penning regrets for their
Exes.’ inability to make new engagements or
to keep those already made. Lord Somers's
knee-injury explains his seclusion ; and Lady
Somers still is off duty with the ’flu.
The white and gold banquet hall at Men-
zies’ was commandeered on a recent after-
room for a bridge party whose excuse was
the. Women’s Hospital’s needs; and the
mangement provided tea. The organisers
were Mrs. Fred Krcrouse, once Essie I’crrin,
whose navy hat and suit had touches of scar-
let and black; Mrs. A. E. Kimpton, in black
with a nigger-toned hat; Mrs. Chris Cowper.
a study in camellia-red with steel embroid-
ery ; and Mrs. J. L. Carnegie, whose pale-
gold hat shone at the summit of a costume of
cigar-brown. The hospital president, Mrs.
A. V. Iliskens, was among those who took
a hand.
Angela McCumisky, who was married to
I)r. George Murphy, of iCork, was the guest
of honor at a linen and silver tea on the
eve of the great occasion. Amongst the pile
of offerings was a case of cutlery from the
attendants of St. Patrick’s, where the lady
for some years has been organist. The bride,
who is an only daughter of a Min yip family,
wore silver lame with a froth of georgette.
The train was caught on one shoulder with
a cluster of orange blossoms, and a chaplet
of the same was the fountain-head of a beau-
tiful veil of Limerick lace.
The widow of Major Eric Connolly lias
made a second choice, and again she has
chosen from the Service. The new bride-
groom is Captain Durmot Roberts Hanlon:
the bride is the only daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Maclellan, of tin’s city. The marriage
took place in Bombay on July 12.
The lady of downcast eyes and unshingled
locks is Gertrude Hutton, who has taken
passage for the other side of the Pacific,
where she will
do her best to
soothe the sav-
age breasts of
the Americans
with hermezzo-
contralto voice.
Madame Dar-
ling stood by

Hutton sang

The J. M. Wallace household has recovered
daughter Haidee after a lengthy visit to
Papua, where she stayed with her brother,
Dr. W. 11. Wallace, Government Medical
Officer at Port Moresby, only to lose her
again. She has made a marriage date with
H. W. Champion, and has • returned for just
long enough to collect a trousseau.
When Nancy Denison, daughter of the
Harry Denison couple of Toorak, took Ken-
neth Crawshaw for better or worse the other
evening she was in white satin and geor-
gette, with a dash of diamente and a tulle veil,
and she held a sheaf of pink roses and orchids.
Her attendant maid was Judy Pritz, all pink
taffetas and tulle, with hat and posy to
match. There was revelry afterwards at
Menzies’.
Both the leading lights in Saturday even-
ing's smart wedding crossed Bass Straits to
attend. The bride was Vera Florence, daugh-
ter of Mrs. Pitman, of Hobart; the bride-
groom was Sydney James Sawyer, scion of
the P. C. Sawyers of Armadale. The bridal
gown was a shimmer of silver, and a veil
of Brussels lace which floated over the long
train was ornamented with a spray of orange-
blossoms. A shower of pink roses made an
effective color touch. Margery Pitman, Pearl
Sawyer and Vera Bates were the three
attendants, gowned in varying shades of taf-
fetas, ranging from primrose to tangerine and
blended like tints of dawn. Their hair was
confined with swathes of tulle. The newly-
weds will live in Hobart.
Though women are not eligible for election
as aldermen and city councillors of Mel-
bourne, they
can be elected
to serve a
shire or non-
m e tropolitan
borough. I'jast
week one of
ihe candidates
in Doncaster
Shire was Mrs.
Angela Booth,
wife of Dr.
.lames Booth,
of North Mel-
bourne. Mrs.
Booth, who is
pictured here by
Broo thorn, won
her seat. The
new councillor
should be a
decided acqui-
sition to the
body, being a
... , . , tine speaker
™, a broad outlook upon social problems.
She is the only woman on the executive of
the National Federation, and is the first pre-
sident of the Victorian Women’s Citizens’
movement. She has studied, in particular,
ways and means of helping mental defec-
tives. A University woman, she finds one of
her recreations in the Playlovers’ Club
which promotes the studying snd reading
of plays of the sort that constitute literature.
~ A rather dull week-end was enlivened by
w 6, ,^ 01l A l Yarra Tennis Club’s dance.
Wattle bloom, yellow broom and pussy
willow made an effective background for
fascinating frocks. Mrs. Jack McComas, in
apparel of flame-liued georgette with Bel-
gian hare fur, was somewhere near the
ce “t re of the picture. Mrs. Harry Pur-
nell s floral uinon was veiled by filmy black
lace, and blue forget-me-nots and quillings
of twine-colored lace wandered over Dorothy
Hart’s shell-pink taffeta frock.
There was nothing dull about the annual
meeting of the British Music Society which
was held at the Jimmy Dyers’ home at
f oorak. ilie formal business was despatched
expeditiously under the chairmanship of the
dost, who is also the branch treasurer. The
hostess, who is lion, representative of the
D.M.S., wore the Frencliiest of pink and
powder-blue frocks and made a little speech
recording the branch’s progress, which lias
made it the envy of all others. When officers
iuuL been elected and thanked, pianist Mrs.
F. 11. Prockter and her two clever flapper
daughters, violinist Margery and ’cellist
Hwen, gave the first performance in this city
of Frank Bridge’s “Miniatures,” eight short
dance melodies, arranged as trios. After-
wards there was supper, spread among brass
bowls of pink peach blossom. The society,
which was but a frail thing until Mrs. Dyer
put money and energy into it, now has almost
400 members, a bank balance of 1247, a trust
fund of £lOOO, a room and a good music
library, lhe parent body in London, recog-
nising the work of the chatelaine of Ivinnoull,
lias made her a vice-president of the execu-
tive.
Executive members of the Housewives’
Association splashed out in the rain to their
rooms m Little Collins-strcet to greet Mrs.
Lilian, J.P., president of the Tasmanian
body, who was passing through ou her way
back from conferences of housewives and
women r Justices in Sydney. As the presi-
, r s ‘ Hlencross, was nursing a sprained
ankle, Mrs. G. H. James said the words of
welcome. The lady from the Apple Isle is
a special magistrate of the Children’s Court
, Launceston; and in their capacity as
housewives she and her associates have been
responsible, among other tilings, for the re-
form of Hobart’s abattoir methods. Mrs. W.
-lliomas, who has also been in Sydney attend-
ing conferences, gave a little account of the
work done. Then most of those present
adjourned to a teashop, where special tables
were spread with orange-hued mats to blend
with vases of Iceland poppies.
Mona Mcßurney, Mus. Bac., whose opera
I lie Dalmatian was produced in June at
the Playhouse, was elected the other day a
life member of the Lyceum Club. This dis-
tinction is rare, and only two other women
have thus far been honored. The late Ada
< -ambsidge, the authoress, was one and Melba
the other.
At last Margaret Baskerville’s war
memorial, the commission of the women of
Maryborough, as their tribute to the men
of the district who fought the great
light, is completed. Twice the date of the un-
veiling has been announced, and it has been
found impossible to get the bronze castings
ready. Last week many people viewed tin-
splendid bit of sculpture of an A.I.F. soldier
in action, and also the accompanying panels
for the pedestal, and pronounced the monu-
ment the best bit of work this Australian
sculptor has done.
The famous bar at Menzies’ decorated with
pictures of lions, tigers, peacocks and kan-
garoos, painted by Phil Goatcher, is to go
into retirement, becoming a mere business
office. A new bar on Bourke-street replaces
the old dining-room, which saw many a his-
toric feast. Here it was that a baroner
gave a supper, the night before he was mar-
ried. so uplifting that some of the guests
walked down along the table top instead of
down the passage when it was time to go
home. Another recollection that lingers is of
a B. H. Prop, dinner. An original share-
holder was telling his fellow Broken Million-
aires how their money was made, when a
small newsboy put his head through the
window and yelled “Chuck us a million, Mr.
.T amieson.”
At the Artists’ Society’s galleries the mem-
bers of the Alliance Francaise lately listened
t? ''L, Epreuve,” a delightful comedy of the
eighteenth century by Marivaux. Coffee,
chat and dancing tilled in the evening. Pre-
sident Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, in a blue velvet
wrap covering a gleam of pink beneath:
Mrs. Mortill, wearing a much-beaded almond-
green gown; Olive Davies, with cerise velvet
upon a black and white lace frock; Miss
Monash, Mrs. Corrie Gardner, the Misses
Kerry and Madame Intz and her daughter
Lulu were interested onlookers.
The coming of Cobham certainly has given
an impetus to flying in Melbourne. The
Aero Club is besieged by male applicants for
membership, and quite a number of women
are getting ready to grasp the joy-stick.
Sister Adelaide has been here and there: —
the Adelaide R.C.’s meeting at Victoria Park wa-
rt-markable chiefly for a long programme and an
unusually heavy crop of accidents. In spite of a
keen east wind several of the frocks foreshadowed
summer. His Ex. and Lady Bridges were there
with daughter Alvilde.
To raise funds for Marjorie Bounin, a Daleroze
student in London, a dance was held at the Palais
Royal by the Dalcroze committee. Charitable darner
engaged boxes and brought along parties of young
people, and daffodils and violets blossomed every-
where.
Ihe E. W. Holdens, who recently returned from a
trip abroad, shipped 17-year-old daughter Margaret
in the Osterley to Paris for a year’s finishing. Before
she went, all the other giricens of that exclusive
school, Woodlands, were entertained at the Pier
Hotel, Glenelg, where there was afternoon tea and
competitions. The Bridges’ Alvilde went along as
an old scholar.
The inter state athletic invasion continues. When
the basket-ball inter--University players blew in they
were treated by Mayoress Bruce to afternoon tea
at the Town Hall. The reception-room was a riot
of all the flowers that bloom. The hostess looked as
young as her daughter, in golden brown velvet.
The Lyceum Club burst into hospitality the other
afternoon when the President (Mrs. John Corbin), in
black taffeta and beige georgette, gave a tea with
a view to enlarging the membership. Mistress Muir,
who presides over the club’s cuisine, showed wbat
she could do. Lady doctors were in great force.
The Movie Ball filled the Palais Royal to over-
flowing on Thursday evening when every picture-
house sent along- a living representation of a well-
known film character. Some of the copies didn't
look much like the original, but we can’t all be
movie stars. Nat Solomon (president of the ball)
entertained retiring Premier Gunn and his
successor, Lionel Hill, tlieir colleague the genial
Jelly and his wife, and the Mayoress and her party.
The just-married Dr. and Mrs, O. Mervyn Deland
are now on their way to the island of Vanikoro,
beyond the New Hebrides, where he is to be stationed
for two years. The bride, a daughter of the Rev.
and Mrs. Robjohns, will be the only white woman
on the island. The doctor’s job is to fight malaria,
which carries off hundreds of the inhabitant*.
A' “foundation” stone for the new Adelaide railway-
station was laid by John Gunn, about his last act
as S.A. Premier. As a matter of fact, work has
been going on all this year, and most of the old
building has already disappeared. Officialdom will
eventually have a four-storey building along North--
terrace, with the platforms behind; but that won’t
be till about the middle of 1928. Railway traffic—
and this is practically the city’s only station —
somehow manages to go on much as usual among the
ruins.
The R. S. League has got from the Government at
last a definite ruling as to what is to be done about
the War Memorial site. The south-east corner of
Government House garden is to be rut off, about
100 ft. to North-terrace by 200 ft. along- the dead-end
Ivintore-avenuc. Whether this will leave Government
House still available as the vice-regal residence re-
mains to be seen. Incidentally, it is stipulated that
the cost of the memorial is not to exceed £25,000.

to my 1025 Olds mobile Six, I
was getting miles to the gal-

“7 have just had the Carbur-

Studebaker car, and had a test
on Saturday afternoon, which,
quite (’receded my expectations.
I was a little dubious about fit-
ting it on my car, but I am de-
lighted with it now. Emptied
my tank and put in one meas-

Pour POWER
into your Tractor
EVERY drop of Cross
Kerosene is a potential
power unit, ready to develop
maximum horse power in
your tractor.
Cross Kerosene not only develops
more power because of natural
qualities contained in the crude
petroleum from which it has its origin,
but also because it is a cleaner en-
gine fuel than most kerosenes. This
largely prevents loss of power
from carbon-clogged cylinders.
Because of its greater cleanliness,
Cross Kerosene also provides com-
plete combustion—thus reducing
dilution of the crankcase oil to a
minimum.
TRACTOR LUBRICATION
An oil specially blended to meet the
exacting lubricating needs of tractors is
SHELL TRACTOR OIL “ B ”
It not only protects all working parts,
but also possesses remarkable resist-
ance to crankcase dilution.

NOTIONS
Fuji San lost his position at the head of
the Epsom quotations as a result of being beaten by
Amounis in the first division of the Dundas Handicap,
seven furlongs, at Itosehill (N.S.W.) on Saturday.
Each had _2lb. more than his Epsom weight ( 9st.
91b. in Fuji’s case and Bst. 111 b. in the other) and
it was 10 to 1 bar the two in a field of 15, Matthews’s
gelding being at 6 to 4 and Amounis at 4to 1. The
pair had the finish to themselves, Amounis winning
comfortably by half a length in the excellent time
of lmin. 25sec. There w T as some interference at the
home turn, and the stewards, deciding that Toohey,
on Amounis, had crossed the favorite too quickly,
passed him out for three months, but the Magpie—
Loved One gelding would have won anyhow, and he
is now 1 favorite for the big mile handicap. Imported
Mullabawn, who had a fairly good record in Ireland,
also came into favor for the Epsom after his success,
at 12 to 1, in the second division, run in lmin. 25 j sec.,
but his performance was not more striking than
that of Pigeon Pie (14 to 1), who got within half
a length of T. A. Stirton’s horse after having been
many lengths behind him in the early part. Both
can be improved. Another Epsom candidate who
made friends was Aorangi (6 to 1), who cleared
away with a six-furlong sprint for three- and four-
year-olds in lmin. llseo. This consistent young
gelding (he is by Newmarket —Poor Clarice), of
whom the best has by no means been seen yet, has
Tst. 121 b. in the Epsom—3lb. less than Mullabawn
and 121 b. more than Pigeon Pie.
Two importations, Larkspur (5 to 2) and Vitality
(4 to 1), were first and second favorites for the
Granville Stakes, 9 furlongs, and they finished in
that order, none of their 21 opponents having a
chance with them in the straight. Larkspur, w T ho
races in the same colors as Mullabawn—J. A. Scully
trains them both —is a five-year-old son of Spearmint
—-Laragh, with Persimmon’s blood on the dam’s
side as well as Carbine’s on the sire’s; Vitality, also
a five-year-old stallion, is by Buchan (second in the
Epsom Derby to Grand Parade and winner of the
Eclipse Stakes twice) out of Lania. Both are
engaged in the Metropolitan Handicap, Larkspur with
Bst. lib. and Vitality with Bst. 61b., and neither
can be ignored. The 20 starters in the August
Handicap, 11 furlongs, were nearly all Metropolitan
candidates, but some of them were only out for
an airing, and stable commissions were in no case
substantial. Bacchus and Freddie C. were backed at
7 to 1, and so were the Maorilanders, Imperial Spark
and Runnymcde, at 8 to 1, but the race ended in a
hollow T victory for the Woorak—Oriellet gelding,
Boonala, who made nearly all the running and came
heme stoutly in the course-record time of 2min.
19see. Freddie C. was second, two lengths aw r ay, and
Royal Dighton just beat Valamita for the other
place. Hitherto Boonala has been regarded merely
is a good miler among the platers. Now' that hg has
shown stamina in decent company, the little bay
"'ill not lack friends for the Metropolitan, in which
lie has 6st. 71b.
All going well in the meantime, Valicare and Wind-
bag will meet again in the Warwick Stakes, a mile
w.f.a. race with allowances, at Warwick Farm next
Saturday. Both have been doing good work on the
track, Valicare especially, and the filly, who will
have 81b. the better of the weights, is here expected
to win, though not so easily as at Rosehill last season.
f'Uji San, Rapine, Pantheon, Arendal and the unlucky
three-year-old Royal Tea (second again on Saturday)
are also engaged. Rampion and Limerick are down
to meet at Bst. 101 b. in the Hobartville Stakes, seven
furlongs, and Rampion ought to be the faster at that
distance it nothing- detains him at tlie post. Lilah
(<st. 101 b.) looks the best of the big field engaged
in the Campbelltovvn Handicap, six furlongs ' with
Golden Voice (Bst. 21b.) next; and Lucy Thrice
(7st.) reads nicely in the Spring Handicap, 11
furlongs, on her third to Limerick and Quan Tart
on August 21.

Heroic provided the star turn at Williarns-
town (Vic.) on Saturday in the first w.f.a. race of
the season the Underwood Stakes, one mile. Favorite
at 5 to 4 on in a field of five (many punters thought
mi Sbt iau on the score of condition), he gave
little or no trouble at the barrier, and raced with
V\ aranton to the seven furlongs, whence the St.
Anton gelding was indulged with the lead till they
were properly in the straight. There Keilow’s chest-
nut ran past Waranton once Cairns let him have
his head, and, finishing as true as steel, he won,
running away, by two lengths, the greatly improved
Spearer, who came home really well, cutting Waranton
out ot second place by a head. Spearfelt was five
lengths away fourth and Miss Disraeli last; the time,
Innn. 40sec., was a record for the race. Heroic
looks a regular aristocrat nowadays and promises to
have a great season. The imported mare Amanteel
(6 to 1), previously a disappointment, landed some
good bets for Leyshon’s stable in the Seaside Handi-
cap, six furlongs, after Quintus (25 to 1), showing
a return to his fine 1924 form, had led nearly all
the way; and Anan Louise (3 to 1), equal favorite
with Benefix for the 11-furlongs August Handicap,
just touched the old Fortafix gelding off by a short
head, with Corteen’s importation, Snowfire (6 to 1),
half a length away. It was a good performance
on the winner’s part, although Benefix is no wonder
as she was a long way back at one stage, and had
to come round the field.

“Tabra”: Queensland jockeys age well. A
Daily Mail list summarising winning and losing
mounts for the last 13 seasons shows that some of
the old hands of 1913-14 are still near the top.
•btumpy’ Davis leads for the 13 vears with 2102
mounts, 362£ wins; other veterans in Tucker, Hill,
1 age and P. O’Sullivan are in the first half-dozen.
Close on a hundred of the horsemen mentioned have
not won a race in the whole 13 years, but there's
plenty of time yet-—in Queensland.

going at Rooty Hill (N.S.W.) last week was flinty,
and as he carved his way through the Anthony
xioiclern Stakes, Andrew Mack tore liis feet about
Jn so gory a fashion that he had to be carried off
the ground after the semi-final. It so happened that
' > <len, who was booked to meet him in the final,
", as . a “° 1,1 a bad way, and the owners agreed to
dnide. Then the gentle bookmaker was heard from.
At card-call, Cydeh had been friendless, while Andrew
Mack was briskly supported. Andrew’s downfall,
which seemed a certainty would give McShortodds
a skinner; “divide” would mean paying out a large
sum at half odds. The committee, weakly yielding
to the cries of strong joints in agony (it had at
first been inclined to ratify the owners’, agreement),
ordered a race, and McShortodds sought to improve
the shining hour by laying 12 to 1 against Andrew
Mack. But instead of the slow-motion course every-
one expected, the final proved a hurricane affair.
Amid the shouts of delighted punters, Andrew Mack
snatched the lead and won—the greatest turn-up
Rooty T 1 i H has ever known. McShortodds wept
tears in liis heer and swore that the game was no
good.

Fernand Blampain (10st. 131 b.) is said to
be still under 20 years of age, and it is to be hoped
that he will never be called upon to suffer such
another hiding as he got from “Frisco” McGale
(10st; lljlb.) at the Sydney Stadium on Saturday
night. It spoke whole libraries for Blongpong’s
pluck that he bore up for 20 rounds under the
tremendous punishment served out to him by the
colored geniman. Fernand was always a trier, but
he knows too little about the game as yet to
trouble an old hand like the coon, and he was very
much the worse for wear before the end.

It lias been a bitter winter for boxers in
Melbourne, for the Stadium crowd has gone quite
crazy about wrestling. There was another huge
gathering at the Mike Yokel-Sum Clapham fracas, and
pugs who are to meet presently, and were therefore
presented, were frostily received. Mike, who
sports concertina trunks, was roughly handled by the
Englishman, the sixth session being a particularly
toirid period for him. Sam applied head locks and
head scissors galore, and though Mike suffered them
with stoical composure he was “woozy” at the end
or the round. Visions of a points decision in Clap-
“H 11 s * a . v or were dispelled in the last round, when
Mike, kicking* out of a toe hold, landed squarelv
on the chin (modern wrestling admits of these
pleasantries) and forced Samuel to the mat before
he could collect his scattered wits. The winner
weighed 12st. lllb.; Clnpham two pounds more.

Taking the Randwick fences in fine style,
M. J. Mackenzie (Cumberland Harriers) scored an-
other success in the N.S.W. five miles cross-country
championship on Saturday. He went to the front
at two miles, and there was 70 yards of daylight
between him and C. B. Weeks (St. George) at the
finish, with A. Gainsford (St. George) third; the
time was 28min. 27see. Botany (78 points) won the
teams title for the thirteenth time since 1908 ; St.
Stephens (Vie.) was second with 84 points. The
V ic. men were bothered by the tall timber.

On relative form against South Aus., Vic-
tonan golf looks far stronger than that of N.S.W.
The S A. team of seven defeated N.S.W. at Seaton
links, by lout* matches to three. In the top pair,
I ’ ISCI , beat Morrison 5 up and 3 to play, and
Cheadle beat Murdoch G and 5. But the same seven
went down badly to Victoria by G matches to 1,
a country player, Toogood, being the only winner for
the home side; Winser was beaten by Jackson, 2 and
X. The foursome amateur championship was a tie
between Jackson and Russell, of Melbourne, with rounds
of 79 and a brilliant 70, and the Nettlefolds, father
and son, from Tasmania, with a consistent 76 and
73 ; the Victorians won the play-off, and the title,
with a card of 77 to their opponents’ 80, the
Tasmanians succeeding in the handicap event. Ivo
Whitton (tic.) is once more open champion, a
distinction he attained at Sandringham in 1912,
when only 18, and again in 1913. Playing excellently
throughout, he returned the fine ea’rd of 297 (73,
75, 78, 76), Rufus Stewart, the Kooyonga (S.A.),
professional, being second, three strokes behind the
champion (76, 77, 74, 73), and Ted Smith, the
20-year-old Geelong pro., third (72, 70, 77, 76).
Smith’s great first round suggested that he will beat
them all some day.
Australia secured its 11th win of the tour
when Somerset was downed by 56 runs. Collins
closed the second innings when four wickets had
fallen for 229, leaving the county with 302 to make
it seemed a hopeless task, but the Australian skipper
may have had momentary qualms as to whether his
cleclai ation was not a trifle premature when Lyon
going m first wicket down, began to hit the bow-ling
ail over the field. However, no other Somerset
ou t pf the twenties and the innings closed
at 245. Lyon s 136 is only the second century made
in county matches against the visitors; Stevens com-
piled the first for Middlesex. Lyon is England’s
ioi emost amateur wicketkeeper and has several times
appeared for Gents v. Players. He was sounded
about coming to Australia with Gilligan’s team, and
took sore offence when Whysall was preferred to
him at the last moment as Strudwick’s understudy
even going- so far as to announce his definite retire-
ment from big* cricket. Before the end of last
season, however, he had thought better about it.
Grimmett, Ryder, Richardson and Everett shared the
wickets ; Hendry proved ineffective, and his return
to bowling form can hardly be looked for.
From Taunton tlie tourists crossed England to

Kent has a strong batting* side headed by two inter-

its bowling is not formidable. Winning- the toss,

Mailey was the only one of seven bowlers to show
a decent bag—s for 133 ; Richardson took 2 for 30.
Australia opened streakily; Macartney (37) was dis-
missed when he seemed set for a score, and three
wickets were down for 86. But a stubborn 86 from
Collins, a resourceful 71 in Andrew's’ best style, a
long-handled 109 by Ryder and a useful 43 by Ellis
enabled the tourists to show a lead of 65 on the
innings. Freeman took c wickets for 133 Kent

Westralia, having defeated Victoria twice
and South Aus. once, is the champion football State
Australian rules, this year. In its first match against
South Aus. at Adelaide on July 3, its goal-kickers
let it down badly: S.A. scored 8 goals 10 behinds
to 4 goals 17. In the return game at Perth on
Saturday, the shooting was uncommonly accurate on
both sides, but the Westralians proved superior in
other departments and led in every quarter, ending-
with 18 goals 7 behinds to 10 goals 6.

Glorious weather and a 40,000 crowd
greeted the Geelong ’oofballers when they stepped
®£° i; le ground at Collingwood’s Victoria Park to
do battle with the Magpies on Saturday. The game
was fast and clean, and up to half-time anybody’s,
out thei eafter the superior marking and accurate
passing of the seasiders put them ever further and
further ahead, and when the bell tinkled they
possessed 97 points to ’Wood’s 64. The “gate”
yielded £767. The two teams are now level for
, * place, but ’Wood has a much better percentage
ot points scored for and against. Melbourne kept its
place by gathering 94 points to Richmond’s 68; and
South Melbourne and Carlton stayed where they
were by notching 106 points and 126 against North
Melbourne s7O and Fitzroy’s 104 respectively. Essen-
don wiped out a few old scores, and incidentally
bettered its percentage, by walloping St. Kilda with
9o points to 23. Also Hawthorn scored 80 points
to rootecray’s 73, a matter of no concern to anv
save club partisans. As things stand, Geelong, ’Woo'd
and Melbourne are certainties for the “final four” •
the other place is still open to either Essendon’
South or Carlton.

Saturdays League football in Sydney re-
sulted in South Sydney entering the semi-finals nine
points ahead of Glebe, with -Kastern Suburbs and Uni-
versity following in that order. After a hotly-
contested first half, South Sydney over ran University
at the Cricket Ground, scores being 36 to 8 • V.
Lawrence got four of his side’s eight tries. Glebe
beiit Newtown in a hard game by 22 to 18; Western
Subuibs towelled up North Sydney, 36 to 21 - and
St. George, which Balmain overcame, 17 to 6, again
qualified for the wooden spoon. The Rugby Union
final between Rand wick and University was a stirring
exhibition of fast, open football. The fortunes of
the game fluctuated from start to finish, ’Varsity
ky 19 to 15. Both back divisions were
brilliant, but the fine University vanguard turned the
scale in favor of the Students, for whom Sheehan
played as he never played before. The last Sydney
team was knocked out of the Gardiner Cup, which
carries the State Soccer premiership, when West
Wallsend beat Gladesville by 4 goals to 1. Under
Aussie rules, Newtown (6—10) vanquished* Eastern
Suburbs,, the minor premiers (3 —15), in the second
semi-final.

The lacrosse championship, contested in
Adelaide by all the mainland States, would have
been more exciting if the form had not been so
consistent. Queensland lost everything, giving
Westralia its only victory. N.S.W. could ’beat both,
but had no chance with S.A. and Victoria, which
have both taken the game seriously for nearly 40
years. Their meeting was kept for the end, and
S.A. won, 13 goals to 8, thus retaining the title.
Boal Noal, a veteran who played in the 1912 Mel-
bourne carnival, threw seven goals for the winners.

THE INKY WAY.
Just passed his 60tli year on the staff of
the Herald at Auckland (M.L.), Archie 1).
Bruce, whose chronicles of turf doings during
the last 46 years have appeared under the
name of “Phaeton.” Proprietary and col-
leagues rallied round and gave the old sport
some presents—including a big easy-chair:
that was from the staff.
“Old Nib”: Among newspaper men who
held jobs for the best part of a lifetime in-
clude Jim Hankinson. He was on the late
lamented Kyneton Observer (Vic.) for 4.2
years as job-printer, foreman, machinist, re-
porter, sub-editor and acting-manager. He
left the concern shortly before its demise,
and now, a widower of 67, has found a job
in a city printery.
Erskine Wyse, sometime cable editor of
Melbourne Morning Post, has resigned and
crossed to Sydney for a job on one of the
dailies. Wyse, who has served a useful ap-
prenticeship as a pressman in what most
Australian newspapers still describe as the
Far East, has lately been cashing some of
his Asiatic impressions. 11c has also written
the lyrics for a musical comedy which is
being considered by a London producer.
Broken Hill has had a printers’ strike
in a Labor and union-owned paper, Barrier
Truth. The old-established independent
sheet, the Miner, was dragged into it, too;
but that wasn’t the Miner’s fault. During
the nearly seven weeks of the strike both
offices issued a daily free sheet, typewritten
and manifolded, giving the barest outlines of
the news. It was the first time in its 40
years that the Miner had been hung up.
“Trion”: The passing of Harry Purse-
house, at Goulburn (N.S.W.), removes the
last of a trio of old journalists who used to
hold up the Goulburn Post. Tom Hebble-
white, whom J. F. Archibald once invited
to join Tiie Bulletin, was the first to go,
after 35 years on the Goulburn paper. Harry
Pinn, who guided the destinies of the Post
for some 30 years and who was on the staff
for 40 years, retired a couple of years ago.
Purseliouse, who had put in 35 years with
the Post when the end came, ivas a great
. runner in his youth, and the experience stood
him in good stead in after years when he
used to chase the Post’s delivery boys to
see they didn’t put too many copies down the
street drains. He was a disciple of Henry
George to the end.
Evan Kyftin Thomas, the senior of the
pair who now own the old family property,
the Register (Adelaide), had the bad luck
EVAN THOMAS,
of the Adelaide
REGISTER.
to fall very sick
while taking a rare
holiday in Europe
with his family:
but he is out of
hospital now. Evan
is a grandson of
the original foun-
der of the paper,
and his first job in
the office was as
secretary to .T. H.
Finlayson, th e n
editor. Nowadays,
although he has a
rather graceful pen,
he devotes himself,
as the Thomases
always have done,
mainly to the com-
me r cia 1 and
mechanical depart-
ments.
“Spare Sub.’’: An American Court lias
given a useful lead which might well be fol-
lowed in Australia. Two photographers
were awarded a day’s jug each for “shooting"
accused persons after being warned not to
do so. Their editor, who ordered them to
carry on, was invited to pay 5000 dahlars
net cash. The protesting counsel claimed
that newspapers have no right to photo-
graph anyone without his consent, and there
is little doubt that it is good law here. The
callous and vulgar intrusions of many Aus-
tralian press photographers, especially in the
case of people charged with criminal
offences, is an increasing scandal, and one
that adds to the abundant unpleasantness
even of civil litigation.
“Thespian”: Vale the Theatre (Sydney),
which shut its doors last month. It first
appeared as an annual in 1904, edited by
Fred Broomfield. In April, 1905, it became
a monthly, the editor being W. J. Moulton.
In July, 1905, the Player, which had been
started a couple of years sooner, amalga-
mated with it under the latter name. The
new production passed into the hands of
John W. Eedy, printer, who ran it for some
years, with Billy Curtis as editor, and sub-
sequently Louis IT. Paul. Eedy sold it to
I.ala Fisher in 1909, and she edited it for
two years. Then Frank Hill joined her, and
the paper made money and some history.
It was floated into a little co. in November.
1912, and Claude McKay, then Williamson’s
publicity manager, became a prolific contri-
butor. Then Lala Fisher fell ill, and her
partner was out of action, so the paper was
sold to Shipping Newspapers, Ltd., three
years ago. Other editors at one time or an-
other were Goodie Reeve and Wallace Nelson.
“Boro-Belle”: I received my first Bulle-
tin cheque in my native N.Q. township. I
was only a youth at the time, but had scored
several bull’s-eyes with pars, about “alliga-
tors” and similar fauna. In due course £2
18s. arrived, and after “Hop’s” creation had
been admired by half the village, my parents
offered some suggestions as to how such a
healthy sum (in those days) should be spent.
A 701 b. bag of sugar and a tin of kerosene
headed the list, and our grocer was tendered
the already well thumb-marked currency.
He wagged his head dubiously, and suggested
we might try it on someone else. Let it be
put to the credit of the local Bung that he
hailed the missive with a loud hurrah, and
paid full cash value for it without making
any deduction for exchange. Then he nailed
it up on the wall in the bar, where drunks
gazed on it with owlish gravity and admira-
tion for many months after. Our family got
the sugar and kerosene; but as my youthful
dignity had been hurt, another grocer got
the order.

“Mercenary Mary,” the new frivolity in-
troduced to Sydney at the St. James on
Saturday by the Ward-Fuller management,
makes a bid for originality by presenting its
principals as already man-ied at curtain-rise,
and the male portion as an idiot who, how-
ever agreeable, lacks the mental agility
usually regarded as necessary in a musical-
comedy hero. The catchy music is reminis-
cent of airs heard often before, but is not
given the best of chances owing to the light
vocal weight of the principals and the infre-
quent use of a well-balanced chorus; while
the humor, although it often sparkles, at
times also lapses to an extraordinary cheap-
ness. The vague sense of familiarity which
the music gives will probably help rather
than hinder popularity; and there are com-
pensations for the production’s other weak-
nesses. One of them is Act ii, Scene 1, the
humorous swift movement of which has sel-
dom been excelled. It has been arranged be-
tween them that Christopher Skinner shall
catch his wife, Mary, in compromising cir-
cumstances with his best pal, Jerry Warner,
in order to secure a “temporary divorce,”
necessary to retain the money of Christopher’s
grandfather, who disapproves of the marriage.
Christopher himself would have been prepared
to forego the money, but Mary, being a mer-
cenary lady, does not believe in losing it.
Mary is the one person who enjoys the
adventure. Christopher is haunted by the
fear that Jerry will overstep the mark, and
Jerry, being desperately anxious to marry
another girl, has only been lured into the
plot by friendship and an offer of £2OOO.
The girl he fancies, and others, intrude upon
the scene, and the ensuing hide-and-seek,
with the incursions of Christopher trailing
his aged relative behind him, to find on each
occasion the wrong lady in Jerry’s rooms,
makes a cleverly-worked scene which hasn’t
a dull moment. As much cannot be said of
the rest of the play, which is mainly prepara-
tion for this big scene and the washing-up
afterwards —the washing-up including the
revelation that grandpa hasn’t a bean to
leave anybody.
* * * •
The agreeable idiot, Christopher Skinner,
was played by Jack Morrison, who got an
amount of humor out of the part which was
surprising considering that a great deal of
it depended on the cheap device of converting
*‘r’s” “into “w’s.” Ill's singing of the lugu-
brious “My Sweety’s Turned Me Down” was
capital. Sydney Bnrchell played the friend,
Jerry Warner, and did it briskly ; he exploited
the most effective voice amongst the male
principals. George Willoughby, as Sir Henry
Somers, Iv.C., walked through a part which
merely required to be walked through ; and
Eddie Jaye was lively and comic and at times
exceedingly vulgar as an unbelievable grand-
parent. Mai Bacon handled the part of
Mai-y with vivacity and sang “I’m a Little
Bit Fonder of You” in a manner calculated
to win it instant popularity Avith the early
milkman’s boy; and Florence Hunter, whose
acting is colorless, compensated for that with
a voice that is very sweet although very
weak. She was Joan Somers, the sweet-
heart of Jerry. Outstanding features of
the production were whirling dances by Dick
and Edith Barstow, Phil Phillips and Elma
Hardman, Dick Barstow scoring specially
heavily.

Renee Kelly is to feed her friends on
“Brown Sugar” at Sydney Criterion on
Saturday night. The season will last until
Moscovitch, who is on his way to Australia,
arrives to take possession. For one week
more “What Every Woman Knows” is to
be expounded at the Royal; “The Admirable
Crichton” is ready to step in on Saturday
(September 11). “Rose Marie” is on its
way towards its second century at Her
Majesty’s without any whispers about its
supersession; and “The Best People” are
entertaining on a large scale at the Grand
Opera House. At the Palace “The Sport of
Kings” is still followed by the multitude.
To share in the applause the Santry com-
bination deserves and gets from liberal audi-
ences, Essie Fratus has joined the Sydney
Tivoli show; her turn is a quaint one,
worked with the aid of a number of dolls.
Beii Osborne and Nellie Pcrryer also bring
fresh laughs in a pair of scenas. Brian
Lawrcuce, the youngster who warbles nicely
through an Eton collar, and appears to
step in whenever there is a vacancy, was
greeted with applause by an audience that
lias grown to know and like him. With the
Santreys, a show in themselves, the pro-
gramme is on a high level.
* * *
Clem Dawe and hsfe merry men and
women slip through their Midnight Fro-
lics at Fullers’ in a manner which
is earning them a wide popularity.
The cards they play may be much the same
old bits of comedy pasteboard; but the habit
of a shuffle and a fresh deal every week is
one that could be copied with advantage by
imported comedians whose repeated turns
grow much shop-w r orn. Whatever is trumps.
Clem Dawe remains the joker.
John Barrymore makes “The Seaßeast,” the
Crystal Palace’s latest long-distance picture,
better than the films that house has been
exhibiting recently. Barrymore’s rare film ap-
pearances show what, a real actor, as distinct
from boost-born accidents, can do with the
silent drama. His work in “Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde” was excellent; and in “The Sea
Beast” he lias a psychological study, showing
how bitterness and a changed outlook work
upon a carefree sailor, looking forward to a
return to his sweetheart, after he loses his
leg in an encounter with a whale. A humor-
ous hash of soldier jokes is provided this week
at the Lyceum in “Behind the Front.” Some
of the jests are now stale, but Wallace Beery
and Raymond Hatton succeed in filling the
picture with laughter. In “Let’s Get Mar-
ried.” Richard Dix, as usual, hurries on the
road to matrimony by motor-car; this time
the girl introduces herself when she bumps
into his flivver from behind, and from long
screen habit Dick falls in love with her at
once. It is not the first time that people
who get married have met by accidcut. The
picture, which is amusing, is bracketed with
“A Trip to Chinatown” at Hoyt’s.
When “The Playboy of the Western
World” was first launched in Dublin, London
and Philadelphia, Irish patriotism strove to
tear the theatres down. Times have changed,
apparently, and the Melbourne Playhouse was
never in danger last week except from the
yawns of the spectators. The yawns, be it
added, were due neither to defects in the
acting nor to lack of true dramatic stuff in
the piece. They came unbidden owing to
the unfortunate belief, harbored by most of
the performers, that it was necessary to
dress their diction, as well as themselves,
in Irish. And the Irish was less a dialect
of County Mayo than a patois of the music-
halls. The play would have been just as
real and twice as intelligible without it. Not
until Saturday night was there any commo-
tion at all. Then one young man harangued
the stage for a few T minutes, and was fol-
lowed out by half a dozen others. Yet the
indignation of the Irish at having their
alleged rural morals portrayed as Synge
has done it is understandable; if an Aus-

tralian dramatist dealt in the same terms
with Jamtin Flat, the fury of the critics
would know no limits.
Although Synge did not write his play in
hexameters, nearly every phrase will scan:
and the love scene between Pegeen Mike and
the Playboy is one of the tenderest passages
in modern poetry. Says the Playboy: “Let
you wait to hear me talking till we’re astray
in Erris, when Good Friday’s by, drinking
a sup from a well and making mighty kisses
with our wetted mouths, or gaming in a gap
of sunshine, with yourself stretched back
into your necklace, in the flowers of the
earth.” And Pegeen answers in a low tone:
‘‘l’d be nice so, is it?” Such lines are poet’s
food. The people who got nearest to the
right savor of the dish were Elizabeth
Apperly, the producer, as a spirited Pegeen;
and Leo Burke, an able Playboy. The rest
were capable in their acting but tormented
in their speech; except Terence Crisp, who
was efficient in both.
“THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE;’ AT
MELBOURNE KING’S.
The Bloke (Fred MacDonald) informs his
cobber, Ginger Mick (Bert Bailey), that
the name of the tart from the pickle
factory is Doreen.
Melbourne’s current amusements are nearly
as piebald as the crowd which assembled to
meet Cobham at Darwin. At the Royal “White
Cargo” continues to spread an atmosphere of
Afro-Caueasian corruption which affects
everybody but the doorkeepers; Abie is Yid-
dishly wooing his Irish Rose at the Princess,
and Mexican cowboys and girls are singing
“Tell Me More” at llis Majesty’s; at the
Athenaeum the Hawaiians are providing
moderate entertainment with the assistance
of the fat and tlowy Queenie. The only all-
white productions are “Our Liz” at the
Palace and “The Sentimental Bloke” at the
King’s.
* * *
At Melbourne Bijou. Jim Gerald is pro-
viding “Nights of joy” to large audiences
and his employers.
* * . % .
Melbourne Tivoli was invaded last week
by about a dozen quadroons, octoroons, doub-
loons and other Afro-American vulgar-frac-
tions. The newcomers resemble maddened
sheer-legs in action, and their dancing, in
the vaudeville sense of the word, is re-
markable : but their voices are to be regret-
ted and their patter has all the humor of a
back-chatting motor-bike. Also the ballet for
four dusky ladies in bare legs and green
plush batliing-suits fills this contemplator
with homicidal impulses. Athol Tier, the
tall Adelaide comedian with the disorderly
extremities, is an antidote. He is a genu-
ine humorist. Two sisters of Elsie Prince
have all the energy of that pantomime favor-
ite, and the Premier Four harmonise beauti-
fully in songs that are not as good as the
singing.
Theatre-going burglars in Melbourne are
being shown the value of co-ordination
amongst the criminal classes by a picture
entitled “Seven Sinners,” screened at the
Majestic. In this piece of fiction seven
cracksmen, unknown to each other, attempt
to loot the same safe, and are all netted by
the coppers. In “Monte Carlo,” the sup-
porting drammer, Betty Balfour is backing
t he winning number. This is stated to be the
first time the camera-man has been permitted
into these gilded halls of gambling. Hoyt’s
house is still indulging in its birthday beano.
“Behind the Front,” a warm film without
serious intentions, is giving many a Digger
a long laugh.
* * *
In Adelaide “The Sea Beast,” a version
of the old classic romance “Moby Dick,” has
been made so popular by Barrymore’s acting
that it has had two innings, one at West’s
and a second at "W ondergrapli. Long queues
even in the afternoon show that the Tiny
Town midgets at the Majestic have taken
the popular fancy; and a variety show is
starting at the Royal, too. At this house
“Betty Lee,” the musical comedy built round
a footrace which begins and ends on the
stage itself, has many points of resemblance
to “Going Up.” The most notable thing
about it artistically was that Jack Morrison
and Mai Bacon arc better in comedy than
in “straight” parts. The dancing of the two
Barstows was another striking feature.
“Lud”: It is to that dashing showman
Charles Cochran —bobbing up agaiu after
financial disaster —that Suzanne Lenglen
owes her £20,000 contract to appear in
America as a pro. He has handled some
big stars in his time; but the latest is
probably his biggest, and one that will call
up all his tact. Cochran has lately accepted
the management of that white elephant.
London’s Albert Hall, where lie hopes to
arrange exhibition matches for the tempera-
mental Suzanne when her American tour is
over.
“C.”: “Shelbourne’s” par. re “For Love of
the King” (B. 5/S/’2G) reminds me that over
12 months ago I heard the discerning Louis
Stone describe it as poor stuff and probably
not by Wilde at all. About December last
Stuart Mason, Wilde’s bibliographer, stated
definitely that it was a literary forgery, to
be classed along with several other volumes
of erotica which an unscrupulous Paris pub-
lisher put on the market over Wilde’s name.
Methuens, the publishers, and Edmund Gosse
were among those taken in by the play, the
former including it among their collected
edition of Wilde’s works.
“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : “Autumn Fire,” by
T. C. Murray, is another Irish play which,
after a successful production at the Abbey
Theatre, Dublin, has reached the West End
of London and been rewarded with eulogy
from the critics and enthusiasm from tile
public. Murray is a schoolmaster who lives
in a suburb of Dublin, and in the matter
of education has considerable advantage over
Sean O’Casey, with whom lie is sometimes
compared. The main theme of this moving
play, which has been published by Allen and
Unwin, concerns a farmer, a widower, who
marries a young wife for whom his own son
develops a deep affection in the days
when the parent’s breakdown in health leaves
the wife’s life very empty of companionship.
The tragic climax in the last act makes a
deep impression at the Little Theatre, which
is so eminently suited for intellectual drama.
“C. Ockney”: It’s a good many years
since three young mummers of Wilson Bar-
rett’s company—Horace Hodges, Thomas
Percyval and Edward Irwin —started colla-
boration in dramatic authorship, and for
their first effort produced “Sunday,” which
is being revived in Sydney again. Not a
bad first attempt, either. The piece was
taken up by Fred Terry and his clever wife,
Julia Neilson, and was soon making money
for the young playwrights. They wrote a
couple more pieces together (one, “The Little
Admiral,” was produced by Lewis Waller),
but neither equalled the success of “Sunday.”
When Irwin pulled out Hodges and Percy-
val carried on, and scored another winner
in “Grumpy,” which Cyril Maude played in
Australia. All three author-actors are still
on deck—lrwin and Hodges in England and
Percyval in America.
“Wood’s Green” (Loud.) : London is pro-
mised an interesting stage diversion before
the end of the year. Ludmilla Pitoeff, one
of the greatest actresses on the French stage,
has practically decided to challenge English
opinion in the French translation of “St.
.Toan.” Her Russian husband was respon-
sible for the French production, in which
she has been appearing three or four times
a week for the past 18 months, and with the
greatest success. London is keen to com-
pare the Joan of the French actress with
that of Sybil Thorndike. Although the latter
plays ( the part in exquisite accord with
Shawl’s ideas, there are many who contend
that she does not fully account for the
spiritual side of the wonderful peasant girl,
Madame Pitoeff, on the other hand, throws
this phase of the character into higli relief,
and in the trial scene makes a great appeal
by a copious current of tears.
“Brickfielder”: The Sydneyite of 30 or
more years ago, who could get a meal of
sorts for 3d. and a three-courser which in-
cluded poultry and real oyster-sauce for a
bob, was well fed theatrically, too. In the
days when John Bennett prevailed and
people regarded places like Paddington and
Newtown as far suburbs, the shows at the
Victoria, Pitt-street, used to be kept on
until midnight. A sample night’s programme
was “Hamlet”; a popular comedian, Tom
Margetts, in comic songs (he married one
of the girls and was afterwards associated
with the Spencer’s waxworks and marion-
ette show in Pitt-street) ; and a farce, “A
Kiss in the Dark.” For this dishful the
prices were 55., 35.. 25.. Is., and (for a few
standing spaces) 6d. Burfitt, Andrews (his
wife was Nellie Montague) and Howe gave
their shows at the Royal-Adelphi at 25.,
Is. and (id. “Black-eyed Susan” and “The
Three Musketeers” were joined in one
night’s bill; "After Dark” and “Elfie of the
Cherry-tree Inn” in another —the capable
comedian Charlie Young was also an
attraction.

Point
“Private Boxer”: Guy Bates Post has dis-
covered an Australian author. Before he
left for South Africa the American star
arranged with Isabel Handley, who for years
has been one of the mainstays of the Reper-
tory movement in Melbourne, for the rights
of her piece, “The Mandarin’s Coat,” which
created a very good impression when done
by the amateurs a few months back. G.B.P.
will stage the play during his African tour,
and in it will later re-introduce himself to
STOCKING UP.
ARTIST: “I wish you’d run down town for
me. I’m right out of vermilion.”
CARETAKER’S CHILD: “You want some per-
spective, too. I heard those gentlemen
who were looking at .your pictures say
you were out of that.”
his native land. So it seems there are some
capable playwrights here, after all. But
note that it takes a visiting manager to dis-
cover them.
“Beauseant”: Leon Gordon, whose “White
Cargo” has only one woman in it to do the
mischief, intends to go one better. He
threatens to write a play, “Trade Winds,”
which Avill have no woman in the cast. It’s
a dangerous experiment. Eden would have
been very dull, when all’s said, without Eve.
Besides, the fact that Tondeleyo in “White
Cargo" wears little else but an alluring smile
and a coat of chocolate paint is the real
reason for reserved stalls full of middle-aged
men every night. They love nature for Art’s
sake.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Poor old Jimmy Martin
is dead; he died a few months ago, but no-
body appears to have known that he was
a relic of the old Sydney stage, whose history
went back to the days of the Queen’s and
the Victoria—he was one of the cast in the
prohibited production of the story of the
Kelly Gang. He had one period away from
the stage, when he became a pastoralist in
Queensland; but a big drought beat him out,
and though he took to stage work again he
never regained his old footing. Yet he was
a remarkably fine actor, and in Auckland
only 20 years ago, in a mere old-man part, he
got the biggest share of the audience’s
applause. "Fluffy Jim” was noted for being
letter-perfect on the first night, and there-
after drifting away from the text until, after
a week or so, liis colleagues could never
expect to get a cue in its original form. He
was an old man when I first met him a
generation ago; but he-remained vigorous
up to nearly the end. The pictures helped
him to struggle through in his last days—
his work as the priest in “The Sentimental
Bloke” was excellently done; and he took a
job as verger at St. John’s Presbyterian
Church, Paddington, to help him further.
The Sunday I discovered him there I was
walking along Oxford-street, and he had
crossed the road from the church. “I came
over to have a look at the Town Hall clock,”
lie said. “It’s about time the show was out.”
“Voice Off”; Victor Gouriet, who is the
French waiter of “Our Liz” at the Mel-
bourne Palace, first came to these shores
with “The Blue Moon” a score of years ago,
and was with the Firm for years. A bit of
him is real Australian. He was a slick
eccentric dancer, and while playing in “The
Three Little Maids” at the Adelaide Royal
broke the tendon Achilles of one leg. An
operation was performed and a kangaroo's
sinew was substituted for his own. Though
it is still doing good work it won’t let its
owner dance.
“Adam Ant”: While Fred MacDonald is
being the Sentimental Bloke in Deunis’s
play at Melbourne King’s, Walter Cornock,
the first Bloke, is playing at the adjacent
Palace. Both mummers are dinkum Aussies
who have done good work. MacDonald has
been everything from the immortal Dave in
“Our Selection” to Hubert in “King John.”
Cornock played comedy parts for three years
in King’s marathon bellow show at the Bris-
bane Royal. At present lie is a somewhat
obvious and wholly impossible Cockney in
“Our Liz.”
“Goldilocks”: Film actors cannot even die
without being loud about it. One doctor is
enough to kill the average human, but it took
to- see Rudolph Valentino across Jor-
dan ; and when Pola Negri heard the news
it took two doctors to restore her to
consciousness. Also three wives (two of
them ex) mourned and quarrelled over the
funeral, and another woman, who said he
had been very-kind to her, committed suicide.
All this news has been agitating the cable
since Valentino died last week, still quite a
young man, after having apparently spent
the colossal sums of money he has been re-
ceiving as a screen star; and it is all parti-
cularly nauseating because of the feeling that
the columns of cable space used are not in-
spired so much by any real interest in an
indifferent actor who will be forgotten in a
few years as by the determination of the film
people to make every post a post on which
to paste announcements of the world-import-
ance of the movie business.
“Curtain Raiser”: Towards the end of the
Pavlova season I got tired of meeting mem-
bers of the troupe with Oxford accents
Englishmen thinly disguised by “-off” and
“-ski.” An exception was Robert Lascelles,
the bright young man who stayed, behind for
“Tell Me More,” in Melbourne. Some day
he will have to face a dread alternative —
either going on with dancing or cobbling the
world’s feet. His father is Bostock, the
bootmaker.
“Glen A.”: That original Kelly Gang
drama, “Ostracised,” produced at the old
wooden Princess, Melbourne, included in
the east Ada Grantleigb. This was her
debut; and afterwards she became one of
the best-known actresses of her day. She
married sparsely-clad W. .T. Chidley, of
“Answer” fame, and died in Melbourne many
years ago.
“Hamfat”: The public is curiously im-
pressed by the postponement of the opening
of a show when its success elsewhere is given
as the reason for its delayed arrival. I dis-
covered that fact when a frost bit the com-
pany I was with in Forbes (N.S.W.) to
such an extent that it was unable to get on
to Parkes on tlie clay appointed. Making
the best of things, however, circulars were
printed and scattered in Parkes announcing
the cancellation of the first night’s per-
formance—two nights had been booked—on
account of the demand of Forbes, after the
co.’s brilliant success, for an extra night’s
show. The delay enabled finances to be
arranged; and when the co. arrived in Parkes
on the following evening, people were already
commencing to gather round the hall. It
was a packed house, which gave an idea for
future policy—thereafter the advertised first
night in every town was cancelled because
of the popular demand for an extra per-
formance in the previous “stand.” Full
coffers were the result. But a man to whom
I passed on the idea killed it stone dead.
To save a feAv shillings and some trouble lie
made the fake obvious, and that led to
exposure. There arc always people like that
in the theatrical business; and tlieir Avails
about hard luck echo to Heaven.
“W.L.”: It is commendable in the Bris-
bane Repertory Society to be ambitious and
stage such plays as “Candida”; but the
society has no fund of professional talent
on which to draw; and, though it is a
valuable asset, amateur enthusiasm is not
necessarily an artistic qualification. A
Pinero farce may not be “up to repertory
standard,” but it gives amateurs valuable
training.
ANCIENT AND MODERN.
“Aotors they call themselves, laddie! Why, dammit, in
these days they can't even look like actors!”
“Warihi” : Auckland with its 38 city and
suburban picture-shows is to have tAvo more;
one is to be added by the J. C. Williamsons,
in Queen-street, near the new Majestic, the
flashest in the toAvn. Some of the suburban
houses are very elaborate; and a hefty pro-
portion of the £BOO,OOO uoav sunk is not
revenue-producing. The shows have fallen
victims to (lie craze for special features; in
one £750 was paid for a week’s run of a
special film; and many of the city houses
pay £2OO a Aveek for programmes, Imitating
the lead of Dunedin and Christchurch, Avhero
co-operathe buying and publicity is prac-
tised, the Auckland owners have formed a
buying combination.
“Buy”: When Mendelssohn Avrote his
tuneful music to “A Midsummer Night's
Dream” Melbourne wasn’t on the map; but
the city uoav contains Avhat is claimed to be
the MS. of the Wedding March. Its early
history is somewhat uncertain, but a Madame
Anna Luttich presented it to her son Fred-
erick, Avho in 1875 brought it to Melbourne.
Luttich, Avidely known in orchestral circles
for his skill on Avood-wind instruments, died
in 1917, and left it to its present owner—a
former pupil.
“Leamington” : The First Cavalry Division
recently received a gentle reminder of the
HollyAA-ood influence in Australia. An
Orange (N.S.W.) firm submitted its claim
for forage supplied to the “0.C., Ist Cow-
boy Division, Sydney.”
“White Way” : Another actress who could
make little headway in Australia has re-
cently been showered with bouquets by New
York critics. When the Theatre Guild put
on “The Chief Thing,” a translation from
the Russian of Nicholas Evremiff, one paper
declared that there should be laurel wreaths
for tAvo of the performers—“two Avreaths,
indeed, for Esther Mitchell.”
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) on a forgotten star: —
Even among the pioneers there are very few who
are likely to remember the Melbourne d6but in 1855
of Dolores Drummond, the “mother of the English
stage,” who was buried in the family grave at
Twickenham on July 15, aged 92. Between the
days of her first appearance in Melbourne, 70 years
ago, and her last in England, at a charity matinee
in her 80th year, Dolores Drummond had played
many parts with Forbes Robertson, John Hare and
other heroic stage figures. With her mother (a
daughter of Samuel Drummond, R.A., the painter of
“The Death of Nelson”) she had emigrated to Aus-
tralia in the “roaring ’fifties.” They had both
studied painting; but there was little demand for
miniatures, and after a period of privation Dolores
was engaged as a chorus lady at the Royal, Mel-
bourne, for Anna Bishop’s season at £8 a Aveek.
Later on she had an engagement at the old “Iron Pot ’
to speak a few lines in. “Timour, the Tartar, the
pay being £2 a week. She left-the-Iron Pot for a
dramatic season at the Theatre Royal, Avhere, owing
to the illness of the leading lady, she was called
on to play Ophelia to the Hamlet of Neil Warner,
This opportunity gave her a great advance in the
profession; and Dolores Drummond, again as Ophelia
and as Desdemona, cut an important figure on the
bills when G. V. Brooke staged “Hamlet” and
“Othello.” She was the first woman to go dov ti
a gold-mine.at Ballarat. Brooke “stood” drinks for
the men in the shaft and invited them to the theatre
that eA'euing, when they gave the young actress a
wildly enthusiastic greeting.
“Sucre”: Playing at Wagga some years
back, the hero of the drama bad to jump
from the rocks at the back
of the stage into a river. A
scene-sliifter bad forgotten
the mattress on which the
hero had to fail. There was
a loud crash as he hit the
boards. But he rose to the
occasion. “Aha!” he said,
“the river is frozen.”
“L.H.P.” : Concerning the
visits of Gaiety troupes to
Australia (B. 19/8/’26), an
interesting account of ' the
tour of the fourth co. (18951
is to be found in “Round the
World Avith a Gaiety Girl;”
Avi'it ten by Granville Bat.
tock. Granville was the con
ductor; and another brother,
Leedham, played the Judge
in “A Gaiety Girl,” a role
taken later by HoAvard Ver-
non when the piece passed
into the repertoire of the
Royal Comics. Brother
Claude came this way in
1902, first appearing in Syd-
ney as Tamarind in “A Run-
away Girl” at the Royal.
Grace Palotta, avlio came
with the 1595 eo., Avas
Dorothy Stanley in that
show, and Lady Holy rood in
“Florodora” in 1901. Ban
tock didn’t think much of
Sydney. In his book he said.
“Books are little read excep;
colonial editions of sensa-
tional fiction. The bars do
a better trade than the book
stalls; journalism is wretch
odly underpaid; and sheep’s brains fetch
more than men’s.
“John's Wood” (Loud.) : Huntley Wriglil
tried a new line at the “Q” Theatre when
lie appeared in “None but the Brave,” by
Bernard Merivale and Brandon Flemming.
Graham Browne produced the farce, which
had for its central idea the efforts of a timid
little peer trying to live up to the traditions
of his noble ancestors and being bullied by
his relations. It developed along lines of
noise and wild improbability, but for all thai
had a most enthusiastic reception. Huntley
Wright did not repeat the success of his
musical comedy days. Eva Gray was beau-
tiful and effective as Blue Bell; and another
Australian, Frank Allanby, divided the
honors with her.
“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : The Countess of
Lauderdale (whose family is of the same
kin as the late Anthony Brownless, Chancel-
lor of the Melbourne Uni.) gave an at-home
to hear a marvellous young singer who is to
be professionally known as Joan Kerr. This
English girl has been trained by Amy Sher-
win, and better deserves the description of a
“second Patti” than any young singer heard
in London for years. The Agent-General for
Tasmania was among the guests at the
debut.
“Wigs”: “Give and Take” having proved
a winner for Harry Green, the comedian has
gone to the same author, Aaron Hoffman,
for his next piece, “Nothing but Lies.” Hoff-
man Avas also responsible for “Welcome
Stranger,” in which John O’Hara appeared
a few years ago. A better piece than “Give
and Take,” but not nearly such a draAv.
“K.D.”: That “White Cargo” is not a true
representation of life on the West Coast of
Africa has been pointed out in the three
continents in Avhich the play has been per-
formed. Cannot this be said of most plays Y
Surely no one goes to the theatre hoping to see
an episode from everyday life? In judging
“White Cargo” people are too prone to ignore
the psychological aspect of the play and dwell
on the story in Avhich this is Avrapped. Many
authors have made use of the intolerance
which develops Avhen two men are confined
to one another’s company. Look at Joseph
Conrad’s “An Outpost of Progress.” This
intolerance is a real factor in life. When a
fine moral lesson can be drawn from a play,
may not the story sink into the background?
THE MASQUE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ring up the curtain 1 See, the stage is set
For laughter, vanity or vain regret.
In motley garb, behold the players come
ted by King Folly beating his big drum.
Romance is there with pale and lovely face,
Elbowed by Avarice, eager for a place;
Great Mammon with his luscious glance and bold;
And slavering Greed, who fingers coins of gold.
A Quaker maid, in robes of grey, Faith seems,
And Love, a lass whose eyes are lit with dreams.
Laughter, a dimpled, dancing, brown-faced boy,
Clutching the blue skirts of his mother, Joy.
Pride, in his purple, lifts his heavy eyes,
And Fame blows trumpets to the echoing skies.
War, Revolution, march with lips of fire;
Lust, in their footsteps, breathes his fierce desire.
Peace, mocked and thorn-crowned, is borne crucified;
With gibbering mouths the ghosts of Famine glide.
Honor moves slowly, dust upon her hair;
Religion’s robes trail shabby and threadbare.
Pale Charity steals drooping with hot shame
To see what mockeries must bear her name.
And in and out, a harlequin, Youth flies,
While Age with rouged lips seeks a frail disguise.
Still in the shadow, with an ardent breath,
Hope, like a bright flame, compasses black Death.
The cymbals clash, out-blares the great bassoon,
Breathing old echoes of some blase tune:
Laughter and vanity or vain x-egret,
Ring up the curtain for the stage is set 1

“Never have I used a Tooth Paste which gives

Girls! Dare You Smile?
The charm of a lovely smile depends to a great extent
upon the beauty of your teeth. Beautiful teeth are often the
secret of attractiveness. Bad teeth not only cause intense
suffering and many ailments, but will spoil good looks, so if
you want to enjoy good health and good looks start using
Plaza Tooth Paste to-day. Plaza Tooth Paste is in a class
of its own and is made with Milk of Magnesia, thus dentists
everywhere recommend this invaluable Tooth Paste, for it
is not only a Tooth Paste which thoroughly cleanses and
polishes the teeth, but becomes a mouth wash at the same
time and prevents that terrible acid decay. Use Plaza Tooth
Paste twice daily. Its use will mean better tooth health than
you have ever enjoyed before.

Get off the stilts. .. .Tab. Chlor.: You almost tell
a story... .Alice J. : The piled-up heartbreak of
everybody is unreal.... Guy X.: It’s a curious way
to write a love verse, but here is some of it: —
I’ll give you two pounds ten a week,
On which you can housekeep,
’And don’t you think we can be happy, mon c-her?
And if we find we’re short of tin
Wo can take a lodger in,
Oh, my heart’s sweet darling, 011, my dear!

a regular Simple Sighman. .. . T.AALG.: Your dream

and form poor. .. . L.R.G.: Just misses.... Arthur

gurgles monotonously J.K.G.L.: Merely a descrip-
tive article with no special brightness. Try a paper
which uses such matter Isabel G.: Prose poejns
don’t impress; they depress B.O.: AVhat precisely
is the meaning of “AVhere shadowy morn the thoughts
of night’s dim traces”? W.J.R.: Your “Roundelay”
is journeyman carpentry R.G.11.: The good hus-
band's rebellion turns out to be a tame little
brain-storm Marg M.: Nice, harmless little story;

words to refresh one frail, faded flower A.T.C.:
AVants to be told with more art.. . . Bushbird:
“Brooding sorrow,” “Pain’s cruel throes” and such
tilings throng the way to the prayer for death; and
then you claim that the prayer comes from “I, who
loved laughter,.” It isn’t believable... .J.R.C. :
Seme of them may be used; glad to consider your
stuff.... R.L.: “Her Coming” a bright event spoilt
by small awkwardnesses. Try again Sunset: The
sun has gone down on your froth W.J.H.: That
freak verse repeating “Annie Moore —Any More” is
like her friend Mary Tomson’s initials R.G.H.:
If you kept the relationship with the distracted man
till the last sentence, the little sketch might go.
.... Half Jack: Pleased to hear from you; but the
stories are only slight incidents, worth a par. at
the outside.... Billie: Sugary verses tame in handy
for sweetening the morning tea G.A.M.: Shocked
to hear the animal “died mortally”.... Snubber: Its
impossibilities make it impossible R.M.C.: Your
modesty “will not call it a poem.” But what do
you call it? Leonard C.: AVill try to forget it.
G.R.C.: You are one of those who think-up all
the misery they can and call themselves poets on
the strength of it E.C.: Much too slight
K.T.: The little melodrama failed to grip. .. .AV.J.B.:
The world is overcrowded with versifiers who, after
painting vague pictures of some place or another,
conclude with a statement that they want to die
there Gar B.: You want to he “rocked to sleep.”
But why pick on us? Stella: Does the rhyme
“terrible” and “bottle” really appeal to your ear?
D.A.R.: If we printed that, we would have to
pay you dirt money J.P.G.: Call Sydney “The
harbor by the sea,” if you like, but why “Fatted
daughter of the horse-leech?”. .. .Dell H.: “Life”
is mostly froth and bubble.... H.C.: Your 192 lines
motor-race verse displayed carburetter trouble from
the start E.L.: Must decline to make it “flow-
eis and hou-ers ’to please you... .Burgoo: Lumpy
porridge D.D.: Dashed dreadful.... R.H.M.: You
seem to write that stuff easily, it’s hard to read.
. ...A.P.C.: isn't a story.

Peapes’ “No-Veste” Suits
Ideal styles for the many informal
occasions of Spring and Summer.
THE Australian Summer climate undoubtedly calls for
very light clothing, yet washing-clothes demand such
frequent laundering that many men still adhere to the
heavy, tuarm, tiring suits which are fit only for Winter
wear. In “No-Veste” Ready-to-wear Suits Peapes
combine coolness and comfort with an appearance quite
as smart as that of heavy tweeds.
The materials are as light and cool as silh, yet in shades
which do not soil, and textures which retain the correct
shape so desired by men who dress with care. This
season introduces many new effects, which are colourful
and original yet dignified and unobtrusive.
The coat has two buttons and three outside pockets, while
the trousers have belt loops, hip straps and permanently
turned-up bottoms.

The New Method of Shaving
NO BRUSH. NO SOAP.
drfhfghgjghĵk
drfhfghgjghĵk
Is it not strange that for hundreds of years man has
been scrubbing his face with soaps full of Soda and
has never reasoned that under such treatment the skin
must suffer? Nothing is more ugly than a face that
looks raw. Shaving soaps are always the same old method
of shaving. They are made with Soda.
But now we have discovered the natural method where
no bush and soaps full of soda are needed.. Shavex is a
skin food. One can shave in half the time, and you
will get a smoother and closer shave than you have ever
had, and shaving will become a pleasure instead of a tor-
ture. Your skin will look and feel like satin, and your
face under this treatment will look twice as yjung. No
after lotions are required when using
SHAVEX
Mr. LESLIE HENSON the famous
actori writes:—“l use ‘Shavex’ every
time I shave, and think it is the quick-
est, cleanest and most delightful pre-
paration ever invented for shaving.”

“Strict Veg.”: The peak time in all the
big sick bays of the public hospitals comes
when a strike is on. That is the time the
working-man who is harboring a hernia or
other operable complaint finds it economical
and convenient to let the surgical artificers
attend to his engine-room defects, board and
lodging being free.
* * * *
“Rris.”: Brisbane’s Water and Sewerage
Board is trying to establish a new industry
in Queensland —the manufacture of water-
meters ; the 17,000 at present in use were
made by southern firms. The board is call-
ing for tenders from Queensland manufac-
turers prepared to supply 20,000 within three
years, and the order will be doubled in cer-
tain circumstances.
* * * *
“D.W.”: Touching these new engines on
the S.A. railways (B. 12/8/’26), it would
be interesting to know' where else in the
world can be found engines with such an
axle-load travelling at speed on such flimsy
rails. Commissioner Webb has made the
S.A.R. a good deal less like a comic opera,
but there are grave doubts about his judg-
ment in this matter.
* * * *
“Coot”: Just sent to Davy Jones’s locker
the naval hulk Loch Ness, the old Loch Line
clipper of the ’seventies. Lubbock considered
her the fastest of the six famous vessels of
that fleet. Her record passage was in 1875,
when she reached Melbourne in 67 days. For
27 years she voyaged between England and
Australia; then, together with the Loch Tay,
she was sold in Adelaide, and the pair were
converted into coal hulks.
* * * *
“Retired Spark” : When the P.M.G.’s de-
partment realises fplly that improvement in
service brings its reward in increased cus-
tom, great things may be expected. There
have been a few hints in this direction
already. Since the carrier-wave system has
been put into operation on the Sydney-Mel-
bourne telephone lines the business man no
longer has to wait an hour or so to get the
ear of his client at the other end. Conse-
quently calls have increased in the first six
months from 29,000 to 05,500.
* * * *
“Hamer”: The building at the corner of
Martin-place and Pitt-street (Sydney) which
the Mutual Life of New York handed over
to Kelso King’s Mercantile Mutual Co. 12
years ago, was the prize structure of Sydney
before the Equitable capped it. Kelso King’s
directors got it for £122,000, and the
Colonial Mutual Life has now paid £250,000
for it. Other firms have nibbled at it, but
baulked at paying so tall a price for a build-
ing many storeys lower than owners like to
have upon expensive city sites. Another
couple of floors are to go on.
* * * *
“E.W.M.” : Wholemeal of wheat, with its
vitamines and other precious elements, costs
three times more than refined flour in our
town. The steel rollers caused the extinction
of the once-numerous village flour-mills, and
as the refined flour keeps so well the big
concerns get all the business. But there
is a possible remedy. In a city show window
the other day I saw small hand-mills marked
at a very moderate price, and have found one
most efficient. Here is a way to promote
home industry and secure the unrefined
article so valuable for brain and nerve as
well as brawn.

The young Melbourne gentlemen of leisure
with “P.M.G.” on their caps will soon be
fewer. The department proposes to underlay
Melbourne with a network of pneumatic
tubes which will carry telegrams from the
sub-offices to the central station in a frac-
tion of the time even the most swift-winged
messenger could waft them; Tubes are an
old device for speeding-up transmission.
They have only one drawback. When they
break down they do so to some purpose. A
block in the middle of a tube may mean
scores of urgent messages reclining for hours
until the jamb is cleared.
* * * *
“W.1.U.” : Shopkeepers at Broken Hill are
perturbed at the prospect of the mining cos.
becoming general providers for their em-
ployees. The Zinc Corporation, South and
B. H. Prop, already supply stores to their
staff men, and the Zinc Corp. is considering
the provision of the same facilities to all
employees. Wages on the mines are adjusted
quarterly on the local cost of living figures,
and are now Is. 6d. a day more than they
were when the system was started, though
the cos. are getting nearly £lO per ton less
for their lead; and as the staff stores show
that 5 to 7i per cent, over cost covers ex-
penses, the cos. are looking in that direction
to reduce the cost of living, and through it
the wage-rate.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: The Federal Government,
meditating a new wharf at Rabaul, will pro-
bably decide to haul timber to that seques-
tered spot. Its Forestry adviser, Lane Poole,
who has been investigating New Guinea tim-
ber resources, reported that local production
was costly, and advised timber from Aus-
tralia. The expert may be right about man-
dated New Guinea, but just over the way, in
Papua, the Commonwealth can get all the
wharf timbers it wants. There is no finer
pile timber than the Papuan teak, which has
been used for 40 years for wharf-making, and
there are other A 1 hardwoods that Papuan
sawmillers can supply to deep water at less
cost than the Commonwealth can carry the
goods from Australia.
* * * *
“Bagman”: Bright ideas sometimes have
a nasty back-kick. One was introduced by
the W. and A. McArthur management to
speed up an old Sydney business which had
paid only occasional dividends during the
last 30 years—a sword of Damocles hung
over each departmental head. If he didn’t
make his stock turn over rapidly he had to
give place to someone else. It thoroughly
scared the staff. The firm’s bright boys, pro-
moted suddenly after seeing the execution of
experienced men, were frightened to buy lest
stock should hang on their hands, and so
missed the good deals made in other houses
which were eager to give large orders if they
got advantageous terms. Besides, represen-
tatives of manufacturing firms made Mc-
Arthur’s pay for the extra trouble in sellin<>-
to them —I know I did.

Why Women Prefer Electric Cooking

Good Cooking Every Day. You can turn out beautifully-cooked meals daily.
This is because a turn of the switch gives you a high, low or medium heat
and keeps it at that all the time. The old uncertainty is remedied.
Low Upkeep. You save on upkeep. The wonderful McClary oven holds
heat, and retains it after the current is off. The oven is like a thermos bottle,
the heat is held in the oven and not radiated into the kitchen—a boon on
summer days.
No ventilation is required—there are no fumes and there is very little
shrinkage of joints; money is saved this way, too. Accept our invitation to
inspect four of the latest models. They are handsomely finished in black
enamel and nickel, and look most attractive in the kitchen. Sizes for homes,
restaurants, tearooms, hotels.

“Hasen”: Pathetic item from Melbourne
Herald : “A husband in a matrimonial case
at Willesden (Eng.) told the Bench, ‘I was
married in 1914 and went to the war. I
have not had a moment’s peace since the
Armistice’ ”:—
Though bells their loud Te Deum sing,
From stately tower and sacred dome,
Yet peace to some no treaties bring ;
And men there are would rather roam
To meet afar
The dogs of war,
Than stay an<J tight the cat at home.
Australia’s old friend Ranji has bought an
estate in uonnemara, where he intends to
live six months of the year. Though more
than one Indian potentate has taken up semi-
permanent quarters in England or Scotland,
in Ireland they are as rare as snakes. Still,
as the Jam is improving his salmon fisheries
and talks about growing rice in the damp
climate, it may be that the plan has been
officially encouraged.
Colonel Dicky Dowse, D. 5.0., Marshal
of the Federal High Court and Chief Jus-
tice Adrian Knox’s associate, started his
Australian career when, as a young Scottish
immigrant, he entered the old A.J.S. Bank
in Brisbane. Keen on soldiering, he served
with the Volunteer Rifles, and later went
to S’Africa with the first Q.M.1., with which
his chief of later days, General Chauvel,
served as adjutant. He was later trans-
ferred to the Commonwealth Forces, and had
a long period of active service with them
in France.
“Ajax”: Jacko could use the lasso too.
Near Beersheba he was bringing up rein-
forcements and had to cross into a wady
with large rocks strewn about. We had
a splendid possie, and raked his force almost
to pieces as they dived across. In the rush
they dropped a machine-gun some 15 yards
from the rocks on the other side. All was
pretty quiet for a few minutes; then out
flew a rope, lasso-fashion, and landed a few
feet short of the gun. We blazed away
while Jacko kept up his Buffalo Bill stunt,
and, like the good sports they were, our chaps
gave him a great cheer when he noosed it.
“Billy See”: Let me give the straight
griffin about the lost-pearl yarn (B.
22/7/’26). The actual incident happened
to Captain Harry Talboys in the unit years
of this century. He was walking along the
deck to a bucket of water, when the pearl
slipped from his fingers and went overboard.
The lugger was anchored, not sailing, and
at once he dropped a sounding lead over to
mark the spot—'hard enough to find even
with the lugger merely swinging. The Jap
donned a full diving-suit and went down.
Nine fathoms was the depth and he took
eight minutes over the job. The pearl
weighed 47 grains and realised £lO6O. The
location was 13 miles off the Ninety-mile
Beach.
“Pick”: Gathering up sticks in a Curran-
dooley paddock, on the eastern shore of
Lake George (N.S.W.), our gang suddenly
left off emu-bobbing when a continuous and
loud jangle sounded high overhead. A dust
cloud was moving across the otherwise clear
sky, and from it proceeded a clashing and
clanging as though metal was being thrown
together. Hastily crossing himself, old
Paddy, our ganger, left for the camp, and
Steve, our cook’s joeboy, set about enlarging
the entrance to a hollow tree. Presently it
rained petrol-tins. The shower lasted a
minute or two only, but during that time all
our agility was required for dodging the
drops. We learned later that an outsize in
whirlwinds had corkscrewed the empties
aloft from the Bungendore rubbish-tip, 41
miles away.
“Key Pounder”: Re those P.O. observa-
tion galleries (B. 12/8/’26). In the Adel-
aide mail-room some years ago we were
afflicted with a very inquisitive inquiry offi-
cer, who had a pipe while “observing,” and
as the smoke filtered through the shuttering
we had timely warning. Also, we had a
humorous sorter. One evening the latter
thrust into his pocket what looked like a
jeweller’s packet, and hurried off to his
locker in the luncheon-room. A few seconds
later a panting inquiry officer dashed through
the mail-room to the luncheon-room just in
time to find a guilty-looking sorter turning
the key in his locker. The sleuth demanded
the key, which was handed over. The locker
was thrown open, and there lay—a packet of
Epsom salts!
“Gouger” : A prospector mate of mine in
the Gulf Country had recently a narrow escape.
He was stalking ’roos among clumps of buff-
alo grass. When he was almost within
shot the animals became uneasy and he
moved forward by crawling, taking advan-
tage of all available cover. He was cauti-
ously raising his rifle when a rustle in the
grass behind made him wheel and fire simul-
taneously, the thought flashing through his
mind that wild pig might be much better
meat than kangaroo. As he jambed another
cartridge home on the chance that the pre-
sumed pig might charge, a dozen painted
myalls sprang up from the surrounding
grass and, with a yell, disappeared. My
mate ran to the grass knoll they had left
and examined his “pig.” It was quite black
in color, and one hand still clenched a long
barbed spear.
“Bouragi” : Australian papers made a fuss
about the “terrible experiences” of some
Papuans who were brought to Sydney from
the Solomons in the Marsina for return to
their homeland. That homeland is not
Papua, but the McLaughlin Group, which lies
about half-way on a 400-mile line drawn
from Samarai (Papua) to Giza, where
the adventurers landed, after driving before
the n.-w. trades. The McLaughliners are
probably the most accomplished navigators
and the most skilled builders of great sea-
going sailing canoes in that section of the
Western Pacific. They are on the extreme
limit of the curious ceremonial trading
circle of a thousand miles circumference
which ethnologists know as the “Kula ring,”
and to them a 200-mile voyage, even in bad
weather, could have been no unbearable hard-
ship. The history of Papua-Melanesian
navigation in the n.-w. season is full of in-
stances of canoes from the McLaughlins,
Murua and the Trobriands being carried to
the Solomons. Not all of them were brought
back by kindly white men. When they made
their landfall they were welcomed with
dancing and feasting, and the feast was the
finish of all their voyaging.

Deep, heavy channel frames, reinforced all-vanadium springs, ample

Rexona Soap for Health
drfhfghgjghĵk
and
Beauty.
Miss MADELEINE DOW lE, a
beautiful Rexona Girl, of 80
Bowman Street, Drummoyne,
N.S.W., writes: “I always use
Rexona Soup, for I find it most
excellent for the skin and
hair.”
y y
n (\
? si
Be Pretty! Be Dainty!
Be Attractive! Be a Rexona Girl!
Rexona Girls are world-famous for their beautiful skin and hair. To be a Rexona Girl is
to use only Rexona Soap and enjoy that natural beauty of the skin and hair which cannot
be imitated, but can be obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free alkali,
which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps can
only cleanse, they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same, soothing, healing, antiseptic balsams as Rexona, the Rapid
Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin affections is known throughout the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin
and Facial Soap regularly,
once or twice a day, and
see if it does not quickly
soothe and cleanse the
pores, lessen the tendenc}'
to pimples and leave the
complexion clear, fresh and
velvety.

The Ballad of an Oaken Beam.-
“ 1%/TY heart was black till Csesar came,”
IVi Said a voice that passed me by.
“Black heart of oak that held a
flame;
And the carven flowers would lie
Over my breast on the high roof beam,
While the years on swift years fled,
Catching the fire of the tall lamp’s gleam
Till they glowed like roses red.
“Swamp-oak guarded a thousand years,
Set for a thousand more,
In carven splendor among its peers
Of settle and bench and door,
My heart was proud till Caesar came
And gave me wings to fly—
Red wings of sudden rapture and flame
And a wind to lift me high.
“Heart of the swamp and heart of oak,
Heart of a carver’s dream.
Heart of the echo when strong men spoke,
House-heart and midmost beam
Of the roof that never storm could break
While passing—name on name,
The words that seemed like the gods awake
Through shadows went and came.
“The golden vessels are dead and still,
Laid low in the heavy clay;
The swords are rust that has no will
To rise again and slay.
But I am throned on the airs that flow;
And ever and ever I cry
Of tlie thing I was and the thing I know
Since Caesar passed me by.
“Brass helmets shone in the open door,
Red torches gleamed on me;
With a blinding light and surging roar
The conqueror set me free.
And I wandered the world by deserts wide
Till the green spring softly spoke;
And I swept from the south to where Caesar
died,
Heart-cold to the traitor stroke.
“They built his pyre in the open place
Of young wood soft and mean ;
And white as marble was his face
Under a wreath of green.
But he rose and lifted wings of flame
And kingly he came to me,
Seated on wind, a splendid name
And free as my heart is free.
“Heart of black oak, red heart of man,
Green heart of moving spring,
There is one song since Time began
That all the winds may sing.
The golden vessels are sunk in shame,
The stony walls are low;
But he whose heart has tasted flame,
He knows and he shall know!”
N.s.w.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Very Human Touch.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE little lane was occupied. A crowd
was gathered in a compact mass
round something. I pushed my way
into the heart of it.
In the centre of the crowd a little man
was doing card tricks. I examined this
master of legerdemain with interest. He
certainly did not resemble Chung Ling Soo
or David Devant in any way. Had I met
him elsewhere I would have tagged him
“broken-down jockey,” and patted myself on
the back for my delineating ability. He was
small and wizened, topped with a rusty
bowler of sporting model and dressed in
breeches and gaiters. And he could not
handle cards. I am no slouch with a pack
myself. In fact, I am asked to numerous
children’s parties for that very gift. So it
was with critical eyes that I watched the
little man’s clumsy attempt to “force” a card
on a certain Leering One.
“Ladies and gennelmen,” announced the
entertainer, when he had finally pushed the
forced card into the Leering One’s fist, “ ’as
you see for yourself, I allowed this ’ere gent,
to pick where ’e fancied. There ain’t no
chance of me knowin’ wot card the gent, ’as
picked.” The little man’s voice carried none
of the arrogant assurance of the regular
street-corner sucker of the milk of human
kindness. He was just a very nervous little
man trying out a card-trick he wasn’t quite
sure of. Handing the pack of cards to the
Leering One, he licked his lips nervously
and continued: “If the gent, will kindly
place the card back in the pack, and give ’em
a bit of a shuffle, I shall ’ave much pleasure
in producing the card first go.” He drew a
deep breath and came down to brass-tacks.
“When I ’ave successfully executed this
’ere trick I shall sell the secret to you gents,
for the ’umble sprat, and you can put it
acrost at your next party.” With these en-
lightening words he produced a bundle of
grimy envelopes which he placed on top of
a battered suit-case lying at his feet. I
watched the little man receive the pack from
the Leering One and run his fingers along
its sides, feeling for the marked card. Sud-
denly an expression of nervous fear came
to the little wizened face, and the grimy
fingers ran feverishly along the sides of
the pack. A sneering laugh from the direc-
tion of the Leering One caused the little
man to look up with a startled cry of dismay.
The face of the Leering One told him what
was wrong. With a sob of baffled rage, the
little man jumped at his tormentor.
“You flamin’ cow ! You’ve kept the card!
It’s the likes of you as does a bloke out of
a honest deener. Give us that card!” he
shouted.
The Leering One pushed him away con-
temptuously. “Gawn, git out. Card-tricks !
I got a young brother at school could show
you points.”
The little man was close to tears. Like a
small child who had just been spanked, he
stood with downcast head and quivering lips.
The crowd pressed closer, and someone
giggled at the little man’s discomfiture.
Then appeared the Benevolent One. He
stepped into the circle and crossed to the
Leering One. “ ’Ere, you. ’and over that
card!” the newcomer demanded.
The Leering One grinned. “I ain’t got
no card. Mr. Davie Devant made it dis-
appear,” he protested humorously.
Tlie Benevolent One scowled and raised
a liealtliy-looking fist. “You ’eard what I
said. ’And over that card!”
With a surly twist of his lips the Leering
One handed over the card. With the card
in his hand and a kindly grin on his face
the Benevolent One crossed to the little man.
“ ’Ere’s your card, mate. Now 7 , go ahead
and do yer trick,” he said kindly.
But the little man was beaten. He took
the card and jambed it deep in his pocket.
“What’s wrong, mate?” his rescuer in-
quired.
The little man twisted his toe on the
cobbles. “Oh, it ain’t no good now. That
skite ’as spoiled me.”
Obviously the little man did not have the
confidence to try his pitiful little trick again.
There was a murmur of sympathy from the
crowd, and a penny struck the ground with
a cheery tinkle. As though the sound was
an inspiration, the Benevolent One took his
hat off and dug into his pocket. Bringing
forth a coin, he tossed it into the hat; then,
facing the crowd with an encouraging grin,
he invited: “Now, then, you chaps, how about
a little help for the poor devil?”
Nobly the audience came to the rescue.
Coins rattled into the hat cheerily.
When the stream had ceased, the Benevo-
lent One held the hat out towards little
man. “ ’Ere you are, Digger. That’ll fix
you up,” he said kindly.
Then the little man raised his stock con-
siderably. Straightening his back and look-
ing squarely into the other man’s face, he
said : “No, thanks, mate. I don’t mind tak-
ing what I earn, but Joe Devlin ain’t taking
charity yet.”
This noble speech had a strange effect on
the Benevolent One. His mouth opened
wide. Gripping the little man’s thin shoul-
ders, he peered into the other’s face. His
expression of amazement changed to delighted
recognition as he looked.
“Well, I’ll be damned if it ain’t Joe
Devlin!” he almost shouted. “Joe Devlin!
Now, what th’ ’ell is Joe Devlin doing this
for?” he demanded.
The crowd, scenting a mystery, pressed
closer. The little man was not the same
nervous little individual who had quaked be-
fore the crowd's laughter a few minutes be-
fore. Instead stood a very self-confident and
smiling little lord, expanding like a bud in
the sun-like rays of the other man’s flatter-
ing recognition.
“What the ’ell are you doing this for,
Joe?” the Benevolent One demanded again.
The question seemed to topple the little
man from his proud pose. He was the little
down-and-outer again when he whispered.
“I’m finished with the dorses n'ow.” Then
with bitter emphasis he added, “or, rather,
the ’orses is done with me.”
The astonishment on the questioner’s face
was marked. “The ’orses done with Joe
Devlin !” He patted the little man with a
sympathetic hand. “Was it the booze, Joe?”
“No, it wasn’t booze.” The other’s voice
was bitter. “I was sacked for trying to
crook the finest ’orse in the world.”
The other showed his disbelief. “ ’Ere,
.’old on, Joe; there’s something wrong ’ere.
Joe Devlin wouldn’t crook an ’orse, I know.
What ’appened, Joe?”
The little man was silent for a time. Then
his indignation against the unkind fates
overcame him. “I’ll tell yer what happened
if you wants to know. And the next time
you ’ear anyone say Joe Devlin did a dirty
trick you can call ’im the liar ’e is.”
His audience pressed as close as it could,
the men at the back thrusting their heads
through between the necks of those in front.
The Benevolent One, feeling, no doubt, that
some explanation was due to them, explained
with a showman-like flourish towards the
little man. “This, gents., is Joe Devlin. ’E
rode every winner that was worth ridin’ in
his day, an’ got the name of bein’ the finest
and squarest rider in the world. And now,
gents., someone ’as slipped poor old Joe
a dirty one. When Joe ’as told his story I
reckon you gents, will join me making up
a little subscription for Joe and givin’ it to
’im for telling us the yarn. That won’t be
charity, Joe boy, so go to it.”
And standing there with sympathetic faces
beaming on him like so many soft moons,
Joe Devlin told his story.
“Well, gents., I’ll make it short,” Joe
commenced. “As this gent, ’as explained,
I was reckoned one of the cracks in my day,
and was proud ojf the fact that punters
christened me Devlin.’ The
world was a ’appy’ place for Joe Devliii in
them days”—and there was a faint little
sigh for bygone fame.
“When I left tihe saddle I went as ’ead
boy-for a big ,training-stable jest outside
Wagga. This stable ’ad been ’avin’ rotten
luck for years with its ’orses, find we blokes
in the stable used’to .feel sorry 'for the boss.
The boss was ja real good sort, but his son
was one of them weak-chinned things that
spends all tliefl* time at dance-’alls and over
a pack of cards. ’E was engaged to the
prettiest little bit of goods you ever seen,
gents., was this ‘’ere son. What the ’ell she
saw in ’irji, I idunno. Anyhow) she, was
crazy abouft ’im, and used to keep tryin’ to
reform ’im|.
“Now*, about a year ago, we got a young
’orse sent over from an English stable. This
’orse was,, the kind of chance that comes once
in a lifetime. It was jest greased light-
ning on the track. We ’adn’t another in the
stable a.s cofild keep it in sight. The boss
was ’appy as a lark,, for ’e saw in this ’ere
’orse the end of all life bad luck. There was
nothing In Australia as could touch ’er, we
knew, and she was guarded as though she
was mae&e of gold. Nothing was good enough
for that ’orse, and yofe can take my word for
it, gents., she was woVth it. There never
wus another ’orse like ’er.”
The Benevolent One interrupted Joe with
a hoajse whisper. “What was ’er name,
Joe?”
Joe shook his head. “Sorry, but I can t
tell you that, She’s running in this
year’s Derby, and I dbn’t want to give the
show away. Anyhow”—and Joe took up
his story again—“the boss was a curious
bloke. ’E liked to* keep his business seperit
from ’is ’ouse, ’e never told ’is son
about this great ’ojrse, what we will call, for
conveniefice sake. Lizzie Longlegs.

Comfort Old Age
by keeping the kidneys active
/\A UCH CAN BE DONE to comfort old people, for
* * backache, urinary disorders, sciatica, lumbago,
rheumatism, gravel and inflammation of the bladder are
too often suffered unnecessarily. The kidneys, pro-
bably, are the weak spot. They need the special
strengthening help of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
This kindly stimulant makes the kidneys active; it
strengthens them and helps them keep the blood pure,
thereby preventing, as well as relieving, the symptoms of kidney disorder. Don’t run serious risks! No
matter what your age may be, an occasional course of Doan’s Pills will prove helpful. Doan’s act on the
kidneys; they do not affect the liver, the stomach or the bowels.
INTERESTING SYDNEY EVIDENCE.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
A MAN’S CASE.
Mrs. S. Drew, 28 Briggs Street, Camperdown, Sydney, says : —“Some
time ago my kidneys were in a seriously disordered state and in consequence
I suffered terribly. My back never stopped aching, and I was almost crippled
with the ailment. Dropsical swellings showed on my legs and ankles, and
there was. puffiness under my eyes. The state of my health worried me
terribly, and as I had taken all sorts of remedies without deriving any
benefit, I was beginning to think I would never be well again. However, at
last I got Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and they proved a godsend. The
first couple of bottles eased my suffering a little, and seven bottles of the
pills cured me completely.”
Five years later Mrs. Drew says:—“l have had no return of my old
complaint since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me over five years ago.”
Mr. Jas. C. Struck, Yugilbah, 4 Eurella Street, Burwood, Sydney, says:
“Seven years ago I was very ill with a bad attack of disordered kidneys. I
suffered excruciating agony from backache and was at times so bad that I
could hardly move. Everything I had to do was a trouble, and I was miser-
able and depressed. The kidney secretions were thick and cloudy and
contained a red sediment, and my ankles swelled to twice their usual size.
I went on suffering in this way for a long time, nothing I took doing me any
good, but at last I got the right remedy, and that was Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. After taking two bottles of these Pills I felt much relieved,
and by the time I had finished eight bottles I was completely cured and felt
a different man.”
Ten years later Mr. Struck says: : —“Thanks to Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills I am still free from backache and kidney trouble.”

the ’orse up an’ down for a bit. Miss Peggy
was talking to us yard-boys and making us
laugh, for we all thought the world of ’er.
‘I can’t see anything wonderful about your
’orse, dad,’ we ’ears the son say to the boss.
The boss laughs. ‘Don’t you? Well, you
know less about good ’orsefiesli than I
thought. My boy, there isn’t another ’orse
like that in the world to-day.’ The son nar-
rows ’is eyes and looks Lizzie Longlegs over
good an’ plenty. ‘ ’Ow about showing us
wot she can do, guv’nor?’ ’e says, easy like.
The boss ’e ’esitates a bit, for ’e don’t like
givin’ ’is game away, even to ’is son. But
Miss Peggy she joins in and says: ‘Oh, yes,
Dad, do let’s see the beautiful ’orse run!’
“So the boss, ’oo loves ’er like she was ’is
own, smiles an’ tells me to get Lizzie Long-
legs ready, an’ to mount ’er myself. I gives
’em a good show. I’ll bet they never seen an
’orse move like I made Lizzie Longlegs shift
over the trainin’ track that day. When I
turns to canter back to the stables, the boss’s
son comes after me on ’is ’ack. ‘Hi, you,’
’e yells out.
“I draws up and lets ’im get abreast of
me. ‘Well,’ ’e says, chatty like, ‘that’s some
’orse you got ’old of.’
“I agrees with ’im, though I sees ’e ain’t
too pleased about somethin,’ for he sits glow-
erin’ at Lizzie Longlegs. ‘Look ’ere,’ ’e says,
sudden like, ‘do you want to make a bit of
cash.’
“I stares at ’im, an’ then I begins to have
an idea what '’e’s drivin’ at.
“ ‘Look ’ere, sir,’ I says, ‘if it’s anything
crooked I would like you to think before
you says it. Joe Devlin don’t go in for that
kind of thing, sir.’ He didn’t wait for no
more, but with a curse he turns and goes back
to the other two.
“That night I thought I ’eard a noise
near Lizzie Longlegs’ quarters, an’ I got sus-
picious all of a sudden. I had been thinkin’
of what the boss’s son ’ad said, and I was a
bit nervous about the ’orse’s safety. I creeps
into the stable to where the noise ’ad come
from. Just as I got inside the loose box,
somebody jumps on me. We struggles, an’ I
was getting the upper ’and when the other
bloke starts shouting, ‘Elp! ’Elp,! ’Ere’s
someone trying to foul the ’orse!’ As I ’ad
thought, it was the boss’s son I was strug-
gling with. You can imagine my surprise
when ’e started this shouting out.
“ ‘Shut up, you fool,’ I says. ‘Don’t give
the game away and you’ll be all right,’ for
I didn’t want to tell ’is dad. I only wanted
to keep the ’orse safe.
“Just as I said this to ’im the others
rushed in. They grabs both of us, and the
son starts shouting: ‘Look, I found this
fellow tampering with Lizzie Longlegs.’ ‘You
liar,’ I shouts, and struggles to get at ’im.
“Then the boss spoke.
“ ‘That’ll do, Devlin; we’ll soon find out
about this !’
“’E started to question ’is son, but the
sly skunk ’ad a ready answer for all the
questions.
“The boss turns to me, an’ just then I sees
Miss Peggy come into the stable. She ’ad
been staying for the night and the noise
’ad wakened ’er. As the boss begins to
question me I sees who’ll get hurt if I tells
the truth. She looks just a little kid as
she stands ’olding ’er gown round ’er. So
when the boss starts asking his questions I
just stood mum. I could see the son lookin’
at me in surprise. When the boss saw I
was giving him no answer, he ordered me to
be searched —and they found a syringe in
my pocket where the dirty young tyke of a
son ’ad put it in the struggle!”
The narrator looked round his breathless
audience.
“And that’s 'ow square Joe Devlin lost
’is job. I just couldn’t give the boss’s son
away and spoil that little girl’s happiness.
I learned afterwards that the son had placed
a pile on the favorite, and ’e was frightened
’e was going to lose it.”
Joe bit his lip and concluded his story in
a bitter tone: “As for me, they kicked me out
that same night.”
The pause that came after Joe finished his
story was broken by an awed whisper from
the Benevolent One. “Wot an ’orse! Wot
an ’orse!” His sympathy for the fallen Joe
manifestly was swamped in his admiration
for the magnificent Lizzie Longlegs. He stood
lost in silent homage for a minute, while the
crowd watched him in fascinated silence.
Suddenly a joyous expression came to his
features, and he wheeled towards Joe. “Is
that ’orse running this year, Joe?” he de-
manded.
Joe looked up indignantly. “ ’Course it
is. Didn’t I say she was bein’ trained for
the Derby?”
So quickly that tlie words stumbled over
each other, the other man brought out his
offer. “Look here, Joe. You want cash, and
I want the name of that ’orse. I’ll tell you
what. You ain’t got no duty to a stable
that’d do you dirt like that. What about
selling me the name of that ’orse for ten
bob?” He looked at Joe expectantly. Then
seeing the hesitation on the other’s face, he
brought out his broadside.
“ ’Ow about you other gents. ?” A dozen
voices answered at once: “My oath!” The
crowd pressed on Joe, each member making
a separate request.
For a minute Joe was undecided; then he
yielded with a reckless little cry. “Right,
gents., you shall ’ave it. Why should I
starve while them as persecuted me lives on
champagne and cliickuns?”
This speech was greeted with loud cheers
from the crowd.
The Benevolent One lifted a pile of grimy
envelopes from the suit-case at Joe’s feer.
Handing these to Joe he said: “ ’Ere you
are, Joe, write the name of the ’orse on
them.”
The first envelope went to the Benevolent
One; the second to the Leering One, and I
grabbed the third. As I stood on the out-
skirts of the crowd with my prize I saw Joe
was being besieged by outstretched hands
holding ten-shilling notes towards him.
I passed on into a House of Rest.
Half an hour later I was sitting with
my dreams. Recklessly I ordered another.
What was money to me now? I had only
to count up my winnings. I had reached a
satisfactory figure when I heard a strangely
familiar voice. It came from the adjoining
partition.
It was the voice of the Leering One. “ ’Ow
much this time, Joe?” it asked. Came the
voice of the little man, charged with a
cliuckle: “Thirty quid straight. Not too
bad, eh?” And the voice that enthusiasti-
cally agreed with him belonged to the
Benevolent One!
LENNOX KERR.
Dragoon Swings Over.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE came to our battalion in May; and
by June each man in the brigade
knew him as Old Dragoon. Such is
popularity.
The name came naturally when we dis-
covered he had belonged, years before, to
a mounted regiment. I’ll grant that even
his recollections of it were away back in the
dim and dusty corners of his memory, and
thus too far back for a junior “sub” to
recall; yet no one could doubt that easy, bow-
legged cavalry slouch; and to see him in
the saddle —well, once a horseman always
a horseman.
We respected him chiefly because, being
over six feet two and proportionately broad,
he soon proved his readiness to instil dis-
cipline by force; and, incidentally, because
he was a major and second-in-command of
the battalion.
In many of his ways he was old, old
as the hills. Indeed, he prided himself on
belonging to the old school, and, being slow
to reconcile himself to new ideas, we classed
him as antique; yet to his rough exterior,
with its shaggy eyebrows, bristling grey
moustache and rollicking voice, was added
a keen sense of justice which made him no
mean commander of men. A strange assort-
ment of cowboy, good soldier and nigger
boss was Old Dragoon.
In Egypt he would have none of me or my
wares. I was Signal Officer, and he hated
signallers, root and branch; and now in
France I had more curses heaped on my
head than the Jackdaw of liheims.
“The present Signal Service,” he would
yell, “will never earn its place in the army.
With its skyrockets, its menagerie of dogs
and pigeons and its ’phones and broken
wires, it’s a farce. Give me a boy with a
helio and a couple of flags and I’d drown
the rest.”
On such occasions I always remembered
an unfinished job elsewhere and disappeared.
Early in June, Y 7, our battalion, with
Dragoon in command, once more found its
way trenchward; Battalion H.Q. was situ-
ated in the cellar of a battered house that in
prosperous days had been the home of a
well-to-do farmer, but" which now leaned
sadly groundwards under the princely title
of Mansion-House.
From the first day my job was never-
ending ; it seemed as if each shell was directed
at some portion of the Signal Service. First
two linesmen were wounded going in ; wires
were cut everywhere; and then our forward
station was blown out lock, stock and barrel.
I had just returned from the ticklish job
of reconnoitring the ground for a new
position when Dragoon burst over me like a
typhoon.
“I always said, and again I repeat, the
’phone service is ! When it doesn’t fade
away, it breaks ; when it doesn’t break, it dis-
connects. I was receiving an important
message from the Brigadier when off it
goes. Send me a runner at once.”
r knew it was not a signaller’s duty to
juggle shells before they burst, so judiciously
remained silent.
It was our last day in, and Fritz was
active with his artillery around our supports,
and many shells had fallen close to H.Q.
Suddenly without warning, “Crash —crash-
crash !” came the shells, swishing and singing
through the air with a rapidity that told of
more than ranging fire. This was deliberate
shooting; and the falling bricks and tiles
told us definitely that Mansion-House
was to be the storm centre.
There were only three of us in the cellar,
Dragoon, the Adjutant and myself; and we
looked at each other inquiringly, though
we knew it was impossible to get out, for
the metal was flying everywhere outside.
The range shortened, and with a swish
and a sickening roar two shells blended into
one and crashed through the house into the
cellar. The impact was terrific; the con-
cussion seemed to lift my head from my
shoulders; myriads of red sparks blinded
my eyes; and then a fluttering like black
velvet, and I lay still with a pile of bricks
across my legs. The whole atmosphere was
thick with dust, and solitary tiles could
be heard still sliding and falling.
I tried to move but was pinned firmly
against the floor, though my arms were free.
I trembled as I heard those devilish shells
go tearing across the open ;my eyes closed
and fervently I prayed that no more should
find this mark.
As the air cleared I saw the Adjutant
huddled against the wall. Where was Dra-
goon? I called, and from under a heap of
debris I heard a moan. He was alive, that
was certain.
Then something tore its way through the
house above, fending beam and stanchion
in its flight—a moment of suspense—and
with a roar like a cataract the whole build-
ing collapsed, covering the cellar with a
heavy mantle of beams, tiles and bricks.
We were buried alive! Even the crash-
ing of the shells was muted now.
I knew I was fainting away; I knew, too,
that I was printing phantom letters in the
air: B-U-R-I-E-D A-L-I “Ziz, ziz—
ziz, ziz.” No phantom sounds, these. By
one of those miraculous happenings the wires
had held!
“Ziz”—“Ziz” —“Ziz,” singly and sharply.
Someone was calling up.
I reached for a stick, and, pushing the
whole instrument, caught it as it fell from
the ledge; the cord reached easily.
“That Battalion H.Q. ?” someone queried.
“Yes —yes,” I replied sharply, “hurry with
help. We’re buried.”
Then it faded, and I remembered nothing
more till I heard Dragoon’s voice, saw rows
of white beds, and I knew it was the Casu-
alty Clearing Station. The Major was call-
ing me: “Signals, old man, I’d like to shake
hands. The M.O. tells me that had they
been only a few minutes longer digging us
out, I should have been an angel now.
Thanks !”
The Service had come into its own. “Thank
you, Sir,” I replied happily; but Dragoon
was asleep.
