THE SQUATTERS
An Australian Perspective (Mel-
bourne University Press) comprises
three lectures which Professor R. M.
Crawford of Melbourne delivered as
the Knaplund Lectures at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin in 1958. The most
interesting section of it to an Aus-
tralian reader, since much of it is
necessarily familiar, is the opening
lecture in which Professor Crawford
throws a fresh —almost a startling —
emphasis on the part which the
“aristocracy” of the graziers has
played in our supposedly democratic
society.
The demonstrated promise of Aus-
tralian fine wool stimulated an
immense wave of pastoral expan-
sion ... .dominated by social ideals
which were not at all democratic.
The Scots tenant-farmers (who. as
Professor Crawford might have
stressed, always stood more-or-less
socially equal in the clan with their
lairds), the English army-officers or
sons of clergymen, the Irish who
shared the Scotch pride of family and
many of whom “were already gentry”
—all these early squatters, however
poor for a start, “worked to establish
themselves in a life resembling that
already achieved by the Macarthurs.
the Bowmans, the Icelys and others of
the Camden set.” And from the
stations, as they began to prosper, men
and money moved into the cities and
widened the landowning influence.
But. says Professor Crawford, the
squatters —or. rather, their sons, edu-
cated in England—
did not provide a governing class,
and even their strength in the upper
houses declined as the century drew
towards its end. It was not they but
the lawyers and journalists and self-
made businessmen of the cities who
provided the colonies with political
leaders . ... Nor, despite magnificent
exceptions, did they compensate for
their relative withdrawal from politi-
cal leadership by any general support
of the arts and learning. ... In cul-
ture as in politics the majority held
aloof from the new society that was
being shaped so vociferously about
them.
It would be interesting if Professor
Crawford had confined his lectures to
this one theme—the rise, the fall and
(nevertheless) the continuance of the
squattocracy to the present day. At
least the old pastoral families still
seem to own a great deal of the coun-
try; and they can now claim quite a
few artists, novelists and poets.
Culturally, if not politically, perhaps
they are making a comeback.
Professor Crawford turns to the
broader theme of “What are the con-
ditions which delay and those which
at length allow the creation in a new
society of a literature and an art. of a
mature science and scholarship?”
Because of the doubtful equation of
art and literature with science and
scholarship this is an uneasy theme to
argue. Science and scholarship do
clearly mature with increased facilities;
but the arts, though they pick up some-
thing from a maturing society, do not
move in the same steady progression.
If Kendall had had the luck to be
born a better poet, as is not at all
inconceivable, we might not have been
able to consider him in any way less
mature than the writers of today, any
more than we can consider Browning
less mature than. say. Eliot.
We need, moreover, a careful defini-
tion of “maturity” in the arts lest in
approving intellectual qualities we for-
get the fresh vision that may matter
more—lest in citing Brennan as a
possible example of an essentially
mature mind hampered by an
immature society, we forget to cite
Shaw Neilson. for whom this problem
simply did not exist.
However. Professor Crawford has
his own reservations on these points—
“ The spirit bloweth where it listeth”—
and. though necessarily limited in
scope, his lectures, demonstrating the
extent to which the increasing maturity
in our society has been reflected in the
arts, steer a clear course through these
complexities.
TOWN PLANNING
The plover cries in air
For the town has grown
And hatched its brick cottages
Amongst the stone.
Where young lambs danced
By grave-faced sheep,
Five-hundred pretty housewives
Wake and sleep.
Nine months later,
And not one day more,
There’s a new baby-carriage
By each front-door.
Five-hundred children
And the nappies to dry —-
The housewives gossip,
Grow old and die.
Overhead the plover
Like the moon apart
7 ells his lonely knowledge
Of the human heart.

From giant mills the clangorous voice of steel rises to resound,
in full-throated echo, throughout all Industry.
Lysaght Works Pty. Ltd. with its record output of steel sheet from
huge plants at Newcastle and Port Kembla make major contribution
to the chorus of Industry the chorus of steel.
In factories, workshops, shipbuilding yards, a continuous flow of Lysaght's
steel sheet is transformed —by the skill of Australian workmanship
into a wide range of essential products.
The story of steel—from rav/ materials to finished product —is one
of transport on a grand scale a story in which the New South Wales
Government Railways plays a dominant part.
For twenty-four hours in every day, the metallic clatter of the goods
trains echoes, like a giant metronome, throughout all Industry; it
measures, with rhythmic purpose, the vibrant upbeats of Commerce .
The steel tracks of the Railways are the broad highways down which
the wealth of this State flows unceasingly to shipping port and factory
a constant reminder of how the prosperity and progress of the entire
State is inexorably linked with the New South Wales Government
Railways.

A GLOBAL POLICY?
WITH the results of the election
settled, Mr. Kennedy has retired
to Florida for a rest.
He has proved himself as a cam-
paigner. All that now remains for him
to do is to prove himself as a President,
a far harder task.
Though he seems to have won by
about 30 States in the Electoral
College vote, he was only about 100,000
ahead of the Republican candidate in
the popular vote of over 67 millions.
And there is dispute about the voting
in eight States, leading to Republican
or F. 8.1. inquiry.
The election of a Democratic Presi-
dent has usually been an alarm-signal
in the financial markets. But the
reaction in Wall Street was towards
buoyancy. This was following a month
in which there was an increase of
200,000 in the unemployed.
Abroad, politically, there is a
horrible muddle largely the result of a
period of diplomatic lassitude, repre-
sentation being implemented very
often by ambassadors without experi-
ence of foreign politics under a State
Department which deteriorated after
the illness and death of Mr. Dulles.
The Kremlin, obviously yearning
for the day when the Democrats would
return to full power, spearheaded the
world’s welcome to the new President
with Khrushchev’s message in which
he agreed to negotiate once more with
the United States when the aggressive,
spying President Eisenhower is finally
flung out of White House on January
20.
Tass, the Moscow official news-
agency, moved in hard on the heels of
its master’s effort with the opinion that
the result of the elections showed that
Americans were tired of the cold-war
and the arms-race. The Russians are,
too, at their end, no doubt, but are not
allowed to say so, except on a one-
sided basis.
Moscow Radio declared that voters
supported the Democrats, remember-
ing that Franklin D. Roosevelt was a
Democrat and the only world states-
man who “understood the fact that
there were no differences between the
United States and the Soviet Union
that could not be settled by negotia-
tion.”
Moscow’s voice (Radio) hoped that
the new President would draw the right
conclusion from the result of the vote
and “continue the Roosevelt policy,”
especially since the poll had marked
the electors’ displeasure at the antics
of the “Eisenhowers, Nixons, Herters
and Lodges, those men who were con-
sciously enticing the world into the
abyss of war,” but who had now
received a “crushing blow.”
The Kremlin undoubtedly would like
to have another Roosevelt in office,
since if Roosevelt had continued his
policy at Yalta the world-revolution
would have already been accomplished
and the United States itself possibly
swallowed.
Fortunately, that policy came to an
end with the visit of Winston Churchill
to Missouri, and his “Iron Curtain”
speech there, together with the develop-
ment in the Soviet Union of the delu-
sion that after handing China treacher-
ously over to Mao, Communist armies
could, without meeting resistance,
create a beachhead in South Korea for
taking-over Japan.
nrHERE is little chance that Kennedy
A will fall for the Moscow line.
The test with most overseas allies of
the United States will be whether the
policy of Washington becomes global
and co-operative, based on consultation
with other great Western Powers as
equals and consistent wherever Ameri-
can policy has an impact.
France has already pointed out the
global nature of Communist strategy
to the new man. A very large section
of the French press, while recalling the
French origins of the President’s wife
(whose ancestors came from the
Rhone Valley), has reminded him that
if it is right to fight Communism in
Cuba on the basis of a Monroe
Doctrine, France and other countries
in Europe are just as much entitled to
declare a Monroe Doctrine of their
own involving the exclusion from
Algeria, and elsewhere in adjacent
Africa, the inroads of the inimical
Communist Powers. And to expect full
U.S. support for their doctrine.
If Kennedy can reduce foreign
policies to an agreed line for the free
world, and avoid the mistake made by
Mr. Dulles of assuming that leadership
means dictatorship of policy and
action, as in the case of Suez, he will
certainly be gladly accepted as leader
of the West.

The first months of the new regime

the South American countries; and to
make it quite clear to Russia what tie
West will and will not agree to; alse
that any attempt by the Communist
bloc to make further encroachments ii
Berlin or Asia or Africa will be
resisted physically if necessary.
There is just now not only weakness
to the point of futility in Washington,
which is faced with an ostensible plan
for the conquest of the Panama Canal
zone, the key to communication be-
tween the Pacific and the Atlantic,
being organised from Cuba. The
United States also is the determinant
in U.N. proceedings, and the change
of Presidents produces a “dead” stage
in which the outgoing Government in
office finds it hard to act and the
incoming Government, which will not
take office for nearly three months,
cannot publicly interfere, or interfere at
all except by consultation.
Within the past few days the
Russians have obstructed almost every
proceeding in the Assembly, often
satisfactorily to themselves.
On the eve of the election and after-
wards they adopted a plan of agreeing
to nothing of importance and insis e
on postponing settlement ot ev)

tions in the Congo and for the Sec

ON THE ALTAR OF TREASURY EXPEDIENCY
“Do you think it might appease the evil spirits if we cut HIS throat, too?”


P lain English
THE TREASURY THRIVES ON CRISIS
very time an arbitration authority
makes an award in respect of working-
hours or wages that proves to be in
excess of the capacity of industry to bear,
and the unbearable is passed on in the
form of increased costs and prices, more
power and economic authority over
private enterprise goes into the hands
of the Treasury and the Reserve Bank
as soon as the inflationary effects become
disruptive.
Every time Government policy or
action creates a false position in the
economy, the strains being masked only
by patchwork regulations and palliatives,
the Federal Treasury gains additional
powers of coercion over private enter-
prise. The more power the Treasury
possesses, the more Socialistic in fact
becomes the Government of the day.
The cumulative effects of ill-advised
industrial arbitration decisions, begin-
ning with the 40-hour-week award, have
produced a persistent state of demand-
inflation within our economy that has
been aggravated by a high rate of immi-
gration and, recently, a heavy inflow of
overseas funds. Not enough goods and
services have been provided by wage-
earners in return for the money they
receive, and not enough profit remains
with industry to finance a reasonable
proportion of the capital - expenditure
needed to cope with the demands of an
increasing population on higher living-
standards.
Steep wage-rises followed arbitration-
court wards in 1959. They followed fat
rises voted to themselves by Federal
Parliamentarians.
Production costs within Australia have
risen alarmingly. Prices for our exports
have fallen. Our overseas funds are down
heavily, and threaten to go lower while
an inflationary high-cost vacuum remains
within Australia sucking-in comparatively
low-priced overseas goods.
Forward the Treasury boys! Here they
are with heavier taxation of finance and
industry and dictation of the investment
policy of the life-offices and superannua-
tion funds! Out of crisis they gain more
power, plan for more revenue for the
Treasury, and implement a policy of
compulsory loans from the life-offices.
Import-control, nominally “suspended,”
has now virtually passed from the
Department of Trade to the Treasury and
the Reserve Bank.
Treasury and other controls imposed
in 1951 and 1956, following successive
inflationary crises, have inhibited the
activities of private enterprise and have
increased the power of the public ser-
vant over the economy generally.
Already Canberra taxation policy has
grotesquely distorted the financial system
of the Commonwealth. The double-
taxation of companies created a state of
affairs where many companies ceased to
issue more equity or preference capital
and resorted to debt-finance in order to
escape the Bs.-in-the-£ company-tax that
is exacted on company profits regardless
of the fact that the shareholder pays tax
in full again on any profits he may
receive in dividends.
It was this taxation policy of Canberra
that did much to create a scrip shortage
on the Stock Exchanges, with the result
that share prices, stimulated by take-
overs and overseas investment, and
spurred-on by prospects of ever more
inflation, soared to the recent perilous
heights from which they have now
crashed spectacularly.
This national phenomenon was largely
the result of the arbitrary taxation whims
of Canberra. It has extinguished the
rebate-system in company taxation, and
has done nothing to help industry over-
come the ravages of capital - erosion
caused by inadequate tax-free deprecia-
tion allowances. Company-tax currently
takes two-fifths of a public company’s
profits, and generally much more of the
earnings of the smaller private company.
Company-tax policy has made the way
of private enterprise and productivity
vastly more difficult. It has had some
Canterbury
And Rome—page 43
fantastic side-effects, just as Government
control of the banking-system has had
weird effects on the interest-rates offered
by hire-purchase companies.
Banks could have borrowed (and lent)
money for h.-p. business at much lower
rates than h.-p. companies have been
able to do. But they have been permitted
to enter the h.-p. business only by asso-
ciating themselves with separate hire-
purchase corporations.
The point of this article is that the
Canberra public service flourishes on
economic crisis and national in-
efficiency. The more financial diffi-
culty the country has, the busier are the
boys who issue forms by the thousands
and require them to be filled-in in
sextuplicate, after which, in some depart-
ments, they seem to be immediately lost.
And, over the last 20 years, the Treasury
has seen the whole of the burden of the
increase in the national debt—war-debt
and all—shrugged-off through inflation.
The inflation which began with last
year’s Parliamentary pay-rises and has
now produced drastic Treasury
“remedies” is a matter for foreboding.
Public servants have a vested interest
in Socialism even when they are not
avowed Socialists (as so many of them
are). Inevitably, whether they are
Socialists or not, as a body they have an
employment interest in financial crisis,
just as trade-union secretaries in other
days had a vested interest in industrial
crisis and strife. Continued inflation will
give much more strength and scope to
the civil servant who exercises “economic
control,” and the nation as a result will
become more deeply tangled in the mesh
of Socialism-through-inflation.

John-hops on the Spot
There seem to be advantages for all
parties in the amendment to the N.S.W.
Motor Traffic Act empowering the police
to issue on-the-spot tickets for minor
traffic offences.
From an administrative point of view
and this is really the whole argument
advanced by the Minister for Transport
in justification of the move- the advan-
tages are obvious. The work of the
Traffic Court will be reduced, and, even
more important, there will be less
demand on the time of police-officers for
attendance at the court. At present this
part of a traffic-man’s duty takes up a
large portion of his time. Reduction will
enable more men to spend more time
on their primary job of patrolling the
roads.
From the viewpoint of the public there
will also be a saving of time and trouble.
Where a motorist considers he has a good
case and prefers to fight it he will still
be able to insist on court action. But
where he admits it’s a fair cop he will
be able to go to a police-station and pay
the appropriate fine.
There is no intention of permitting
police-officers to collect on-the-spot fines,
so there will be no loopholes for mal-
practice in that direction. Provision for
paying by post, as with parking-fines,
should be considered.
With a bigger proportion of the traffic-
squad actively patrolling the roads an
improvement in road-manners should be
expected—after an initial rise in the
number of motorists booked.
There seems to be something of a
sporting element in the undertaking that
under the new plan police are to be told
that they are not to lurk behind bushes
or hoardings in the hope of catching
unwary motorists. They must work in
the open. In recognition of this sport-
ing gesture motorists should now agree
not to break any rules when there are
no cops about.
Portland Does It
One of the rarest of Australian events
took place last Saturday, the opening
of a new harbor. Sir Dallas Brooks,
the Governor of Victoria, was on deck
to open the £6.5 million harbor at Port-
land, or, rather, Portland’s new harbor
—the historic Hentys used the first.
The new harbor has a half-mile-long
breakwater, deep-water berthing accom-
modation, large cargo-sheds, superior
access-roads, railways facilities and over
it all, the modern inevitability, a glass-
house control-tower.
Currently Portland turns-round 70
ships a year after discharging more than
130,000 tons of cargo. The yield is
£150,000, which is not enough to pay the
interest on the money borrowed for the
harbor and the £200,000 for port-operat-
ing costs, but the district has accepted
this as an initial burden in developing
the area.
This will be one of the best seaports
on the Australian coast, and it is pre-
dicted that it will make substantial
progress in each of the next four decades.
Saturday’s occasion was quite historic
because Sir Dallas performed the open-
ing ceremony on the 126th anniversary
of Edward Henty’s arrival at Portland to
begin the first permanent settlement in
.Victoria.
* For the last 100 years Portland has
been asking for the development of this
natural outlet of the Western District,
one of the richest in Australia, but
eventually got caught-up in the post-
war enthusiasm for do-it-yourself.
Recession Overseas
While Australia is absorbed in its own
troubles, it is not alone.
All the world of the West has been
affected by a surfeit of money and em-
ployment, leading to too much spending
and too much inducement to do a bit
of loafing.
Hence the steel strike in the United
States which disrupted the whole of its
heavy industry for months, and the care-
less freedom with which workers in the
United Kingdom and elsewhere have
yielded to the blandishments of agitators,
some of them enemy agents or the dupes
of enemy agents.
In the United States and in London
there seems to be agreement that the
bottom of the pot may not have been
reached.
November has been a month for
palliatives in other places as well as
Australia.
All Continental countries with major
exchanges in Europe have followed the
example of the two great financial centres
in reducing their bank-rates within the
past six weeks.
Suffering from an internal spending-
boom, not dissimilar to that in Aus-
tralia, the West German Government
the same day took two measures: It
cut the bank-rate from 5 p.c. to 4 p.c.
in the hope of producing an outflow of
foreign money, and it clamped-down on
credit to stifle part of the demand for
goods.
Both in London and New York it
seems to be agreed that the recession
is only temporary, and will be mended
in the first half of next year. And the
long-distance forecasts for the next
decade are optimistic.
The annual report of the Secretariat
of Gatt on international trade issued
on November 13 suggested that in the
new and still-developing countries the
average income per head would increase
by $l6O by 1969 and that this will be
reflected in the export trade of great
industrial exporting countries and in the
inflow of capital investment into the
new countries to the tune of some billions
of dollars per annum.
The opportunity seems to be available
for Australia to be -in the van of the
rush to collect some of this accretion
of trade both ways.

As time goes by I’m finding that more
and more of the jobs-around-the-place
that used to be done by menfolk are now
being done by me. I don’t mind ; it’s
all experience ; but the other evening I
did flare-up when one of the boys said
to me: “you’ll have to stop using that
Bingo Bango stuff in the washing,
Mother. Your hands are getting quite
rough.” “Rough,” I said ; “Bingo
Bango,” I said ; “now, just a moment.
You may not have noticed, but in the

of other things, I’ve fixed the fowl-yard
fence, dug-up half the garden, papered
the hall, painted the porch chairs and
the laundry floor, changed the tyres on
the car, remodelled the rose-trellis” —
At this point they all rallied round, sat
me down, patted me, brought me a nice
cup of tea, and were very sweet indeed.
Everything’s fine, now; we talked it
over, and things are going to be different.

That electrician’s wish to see a young

realised by six jackaroos in the ’thirties

THE RENTING OF THE GREENS
“An N.S.W. National Parklands authority
will increase rentals on bowling-clubs on
Crown land recreational-reserves. Bowling-
clubs were originally established on nominal
rentals, but this was before they were licenced
for liquor and poker-machines.”
When land in public parks was leased
To bowling-clubs, the rents were low ;
Many poor families were pleased
That poor old grandpapa could go
Tottering to his bowling-club,
And keeping out of that there pub.
But poker-playing slot-machines
And liquor licences have come,
And grandpapas are full of beans,
And more than bowls go rolling home,
And eyes as strange to bowls as pity
Are on the money in that kitty.
And so the Parks Authority
Is sure to raise the rents on bowlers
To keep our greens and granddads free,
And off the roll, of rock-and-roilers :
Greens are much better, it is said,
For being slightly in the red.

trecotes and Chateaubriands to a dis-
criminating clientele confides that the
basic beef after delivery by butcher must
spend 14 days at 40 degrees fahrenheit
before making its debut on the charcoal.
The housewife can approximate this de-
sirable temperature by stashing the steak
away on the shelf remotest from the
freezing-compartment in the average
’frige. The amateur is advised to have
the meat at least lin. thick, and with his
fire right it should cook in 4imin.
Charcoal is ideal but not essential. Take
care that firewood has reached the coals-
stage, lest the steak acquire flavor from
wood-tars and aldehydes. You can pre-
sprinkle with claret, but a lot of Aussies
prefer unadulterated bull, and eschew
sauce or even mustard. The professional
submits that the Mignons, fast-cooked as
they must be, inevitably sustain some
surface-dryness, nicely remediable with a
gravy embodying mushroom, eggplant,
capsicum and a mere trace of garlic.

Tenderising of meat by hanging for
several days (B. 2/11/ ’6O) is in accord
with the Army’s prescription during
1939-45. A.S.C.-wallahs ruled that beef
was unfit for consumption before it
reached the stage of “simple” fermenta-
tion, was at its best at the “green fermen-
tation” phase, and became inedible only
at “stinking” fermentation state. Even at
the third stage, I’ve downed it with
middling relish in the throes of meat-
hunger in the Torres Straits Islands, when
nor’-west calms delayed for several days
the luggers bringing supplies from T.I.
The parcels would reek to high heaven
when opened. But the blue-black beef,
when rehabilitated by careful washing
w dh a weak formalin solution, brought
ess disturbance to the stomach than the
contemplation of another week or so of

TJUith considerable pleasure my wife
and I read in Hollywood that
Alfred Hill had been made a C.M.G. on
his 90th birthday (B. 22/6/’6O).
My wife is Irma Caron, daughter of
Leon Caron, long ago a composer and
musical director for J. C. Williamson
opera companies. In 1921, at the Phil-
harmonic Hall, London, Irma sang Hill’s
“Waiata Poi” 180 consecutive times, and
to 7000 children at the Royal Albert
Hall; Mr. Goodman of Chappell and Co.,
publishers of the number, advised me
that despite the presentation of the song
“Sometimes he can be a little fiend, but he's mostly a sweet child.”
by Clara Butt and Kennerley Rumford
there was no demand over the counter
until Irma sang the number at the Phil-
harmonic.
When we reached New York in 1922,
Irma was featured at the Capitol Theatre
on Broadway, backed by the largest
theatre orchestra in the world. Irma
taught a group of dancers the “Canoe
Poi” and supervised the scenic back-
ground for the number. The great suc-
cess of Irma’s presentation of “Waiata
Poi” prompted her to develop the New
Zealand songs by Alfred Hill. Her re-
citals included “Waiata Poi,” “Waiata
Maori,” “In Fairyland,” and the dramatic
song, “Tangi,” written specially for
Times,” wrote: “Irma Caron succeeds
where the picture fails.” And so down
through the years she sang Hill’s songs.
At the New York State Fair she sang
the “Poi-song” to a tremendous crowd
through the loud-speaker, and subse-
quently recorded the “Waiata Poi” in
costume as a short for Paramount
Pictures.
She is now retired, at the age of 69;
I’m headed for the 80-mark; I believe
there was once a “Bully” reference to
me as the “Father of the Pelaco abo.
poster”—at the turn of the century I
was a contributor to “Sundry Shows,”
“P.P.,” and “Sporting Notions.” —
“Storky” (M. P. Adams).
basso Watkin Mills —an unlikely song
for a soprano, but she succeeded with it.
In these early years of radio in New
York she was not only the first to sing
Hill’s New Zealand songs over the air,
but to explain them. All the broadcast-
ing was over W.E.A.F., now N.B.C.
Perhaps her outstanding broadcast with
the Hill numbers was the night the New
York Philharmonic Orchestra did its first
broadcast in a hookup with New York
and Washington (D.C.). Irma was on
the air preceding the orchestra, and she
hfeld the air for 45min. at the request of
the studio-manager, as the Philharmonic
was 15min. late in starting. Following
the broadcast Irma received a huge fan-
mail from all along the East Coast. I
believe this was the first time the Hill
songs were widely broadcast.
Gradually Irma developed her recitals
for women’s clubs and other organisa-
tions under the management of James B.
Pond, who also represented Ruth Draper
and Cornelia Otis Skinner. Perhaps the
first all-Maori entertainment, comprising
a movie drama, “The Romance of Hine
Moa,” was presented at the 55th Street
Playhouse, New York, when Irma Caron
sang to round-out an all-New Zealand
programme. Mordant Hall, “New York

~VTew Zealand is to have a general
election on Saturday. The Nash
Labor Government, which regained office
in 1957 after eight years in Opposition,
had a bare majority in the old Parlia-
ment —41 seats to the National party’s
39. Labor’s total includes the four
Maori members —and it can be taken
as a certainty that Nash can also count
on a similar advantage in the new
Parliament.
A swing of a handful of votes in a
couple of borderline seats could bring
back the Nats., but there are no signs
of any spectacular change. The Opposi-
tion can’t match the extravagant promises
that brought Labor to office in 1957,
and although the aftermath of that elec-
tion was disillusionment for many voters
who switched to Labor, recent easing of
taxes —following earlier rises—may have
softened original resentments. It looks
like a close fight, with imponderables
rather than policy determining the result.
Sydney Harbor-tunnel enthusiast D. R.
Carter suggests that the reason for the
high prices quoted by Local Government
Minister Hills is that they refer to tunnels
sjfed at the wrong spots both as to traffic-
problems and expense An example:
the Kirribilli proposal, “which would run
through a rocky cliff into the North
Sydney traffic-tangle.” Carter’s own pro-
posals were handed to Premier Cahill
in January, 1957, but if they’ve been
subjected to serious examination he
hasn’t heard of it. He is still confident
that a proper investigation would show
that his plans would give a better ser-
vice at lower cost than any of the
schemes which have been officially
examined.

Compulsory-unionism may play an
important part in the voting at the N.Z.
general election on November 26.
National-party Leader Holyoake has
made voluntary-unionism one of his
battle-cries. His argument that unionism
must prove its worth is a sound one if
only for the reason that over recent years
there has been so much bickering, plus
a few court actions, among the unions
themselves. As the voice of unionism
Fintan Walsh seemed at first unperturbed
over the voluntary-unionism plank in the
National platform. Then he spoke
angrily against this “frontal attack on
the workers of New Zealand.” Future
historians may trace a menacing decline
in the economic and work-value condi-
tions in New Zealand to the twin
evils of “over-full” employment and
compulsory-unionism.—“ New Zeal.”

The Northern Parks and Playgrounds
Movement at Newcastle has directed the
spotlight on the lack of parks in N.S.W.
It claims that only one per cent, of the
State has been dedicated for national
park purposes, compared with six per

populated country. The movement is
urging the State Government to dedicate
Tomaree, the south head of Port
Stephens, as a playground. From the
top of Tomaree, a 700 ft. hill, which held
a radar-unit during the war, there’s a
magnificent view of the coast. Part of

It gave me a shock to read that Jack
McLeod the Quiet Stockman had
passed on. I used to call on him when
he was a partner in the garage-business
of Johnson and McLeod in Angaston
(S.A.). He was never talkative, even as
a garage-proprietor ; he usually left the
talking to Frank Johnson. Nevertheless,
he always managed to pull his weight
in Angaston.
A prize - winning horseman at early
Adelaide shows, Jack McLeod went to
Angaston about 50 years ago as coach-
man to Charles Angas. An excellent rifle-
shot, he was a life-member of the Angas-
ton Rifle Club. He was also a life-
member of the Barossa and Light Racing
Club, and served for many years as a
ring-steward for the Angaston Show.
One of the Quiet Stockman’s unusual
jobs was to take a shipment of polo-
ponies from Kidman to Lord Kitchener
in India. As a memento of the trip he
treasured a special gemmed-pin given him
by Kitchener. —“Pegasus.”

PETER SUMMERTON
his reputation with productions of Imre’s
“Inherit The Wind” and George F. Kerr’s
Hunger of a Girl. ’ But producing plays
is not Summerton s only responsibility:
for such a small theatre the Independent
has a remarkably large group in its school
and in its workshop’’ for actors ; and
apart from supervision of these there are
the inevitable problems of the technical
side of a production to be overcome.
Summerton s formula is “big” acting:
which seems to mean having the actors
larger-than-life, with the play built-up
from its characters rather than contain-
ing them as incidents of the plot ; and
also sincerity of character in the action
as well as speech, rather than letting the
larger-than-life characters become fan-
tastic. At the moment he is in the middle
of the six-weeks’ preparation he likes to
have for a play, working this time at
the “witch-hunting” “Crucible,” another
Miller play, which is an apt vehicle for
the “big”-acting formula.

It wasn't for want of costly 'trying
that the late Greg Newman,, of
Nargoon, Tilpa (N.S.W.), failed in
his ambition to buy a Derby,
Metrop., Newmarket or Cup winner
at the Randwick yearling - sales. Had
his first shot in 1940, buying for
6500gns. that year’s highest-priced colt,
by Midstream and brother to Cup-winner
Delta. Named the youngster Nargoon
and gave him to McCarten to train, but
even with Sellwood’s guiding-hands,
Nargoon never won a race for Newman.
A few years later, this time with a big-
sprint winner in view, Newman bought
the top-priced filly yearling (by Star
Kingdom from Fleeting Glance), a full
sister to Sydney’s crack sprinter Kingster,
named his purchase Lady Maloja and
handed her to Tom Kennedy to train
at Rosehill. As with Nargoon, the costly
buy was a failure. After that Greg
Newman gave the game best. —“lustin.”

ABORIGINALITIES
TTAViNO some scraggy hens which she
decided were ripe for the pot,
the matron of a nor’-west W.A. hospital
co-opted Dicky, a native worker, as
executioner. Two hours later, hearing a
lot of ear-piercing squawks coming from
the fowl-pen, she went to investigate.
Dicky was standing at the fowl-pen gate,
boomerang in hand, taking aim. All the
hens were still alive. “Dicky,” said
Matron, “that no way to kill hens —you
catch and wring neck.” “Them birds too
fast, Missus,” declared Dicky. “I use
killer-boomerang—that what it made for,
ain’t it?” It was another hour or two
before Dicky appeared at the kitchen-
door, a pleased grin on his face and
mangled hens flung over his shoulder.
“Me finishum, Missus!” he announced
triumphantly.—“Arunta.”

Sharks, whales and porpoises, as well
as a variety of scaled fish, have been
nominated as the fastest swimmers, but
my vote goes to the swordfish of Aus-
tralian waters. Instance an exhibit in
a wild-life show in Perth a month or so
ago a solidly made, but empty, deal
case with a broken sword driven right
through. The speed at which that sword
must have been propelled to penetrate
an object lightly floating on the surface,
and thus offering but small resistance,
has to be imagined. More remarkable
was a bale of rubber-latex found on a
Western Australian beach a couple of
years back. About 15in. thick, it carried
two broken-off swords, the larger with its
point showing on the farther side ; a
strong man’s arm failed to drive a sharp
dagger more than 4in. into this resistant
rubber. The sword’s owner certainly
wasn’t coasting-along to achieve that
thrust. —“Sou’-west.”

Evidently “Peter Simple” (B. 26/10/’6O)
hasn’t had much to do with machine-

45 years, in my experience, they’ve been
trained to be handled in double-bails,
with the operator in between. The
reference to cows not standing for left-
side milking applies only to old ones
transferred from hand-milking sheds to
double-bail sheds. A heifer broken-in for
double-bails takes to either without
trouble. —“Murray Swagman.”

BALLAD
MATRIMONIAL
[Written to a song-tune]
Coming from work every morning
1 see my wife from a bus top ;
She always waves me a greeting,
And I always lift my hat;
For l work all night and / sleep all day,
A nd she sleeps all night and works all day,
And we make ends meet, for we pool our
pay—
But w/wt is the use of that ?
Going to work every evening
/ pass my wife at the bus queue ;
She always gives me a greeting,
And my hat / always lift;
For as / get off she is getting on,
And as she gets off then 1 get on,
And a bus won’t linger for woman or
man —
We’re both on a twelve-hour shift.
1 always leave her her breakfast,
She always leaves me my supper,
/ even write her a letter,
And I put it under the mat;
For l sleep all day and / work all night,
And she works all day and sleeps all
night,
And we pool our pay, so it comes out
right —
But what is the use of that ?
Sometimes I sit and I ponder,
I sometimes sit and I wonder,
Flow did we first get acquainted,
How’d we find the time to wed ?
For I work all night from nine till nine,
And she works all day from nine till nine,
And we see each other if we cut it fine —
We might as well be dead !
We wave to each other in the morning,
We speak to each other in the evening,
We’ve got a joint bank deposit,
And we even share a flat;
But l work all night and l sleep all day,
And she sleeps all night and works all
day,
And I don’t think we’ll ever raise a family
that way —
And what is the use of that ?

not be a better proposition than glass,
shatterproof or not. An instance was
cited of one firm which has replaced in
a single day 14 broken windscreens. A
grazier not far from me developed a
sort of fly-wire screen to fit over the
outside of his windscreen; this has
succeeded in stopping the destructive
flight of stones. One council here in
North Queensland has authorised the
fitting of similar screens to its fleet of
vehicles. Anyone thinking of a motoring
holiday north of about Gympie could
well consider a similar attachment. Prob-
ably save him a sizeable wad of notes.—

Dipping was finished, and the mob
of cows and calves had sorted themselves
out —with two exceptions. Prowling
noisily outside the yard where a baldy
cow, which had calved the night before,
was contentedly suckling a white calf,
were a red heifer and a very young calf
which she rejected. Things happened
quickly when the gate was opened. The
red heifer swooped on the white calf
and led it away, while the other youngster
moved in and took-over where the white
one had left off. —“1.Q.”

Playing on a country golf - course
I was warned by regulars to use
an old ball on the 13th and 18th holes
as crows operated there. They were
right; I tricked ’em with a low skimmer
at the 13th, but Kelly won the final hole.
Shouts, waving of clubs and the banging
of golf-buggies failed to scare the robber
into dropping the ball; a pan of friendly
magpies that got on his tail almost did
the trick. Mr. K. dropped it, but quickly
swooped down and recovered it
before Mag and her spouse could belt
him. What I’d like to know is why do
the sable chicks favor only certain holes,
. and are troublesome only at certain
times of the year not related to nesting?

An acquaintance has a nephew
who kicked-off in the entertainment-world
with a modest animal-mimicry act which
went over fairly well at clubs. Met
acquaintance again recently and
happened to ask about his nephew. “Oh,
he's doing pretty well in pop-vocals now,”
he replied ; “turning down engagements.”
“Didn’t know he’d learned singing,” I
remarked. “Didn’t have to,” he answered.
“With the stuff he sings, all he had to do
was to make a slight alteration to his
dingo-howling act! ” —“Bo.”

Tyro creature ever had a stronger will
to live than Susie, the station milker.
It was as well, because bogs had a
fascination for her, and we’d lost count
of the number of times we’d snigged her
out. This time it looked like the end,
but Dad decided to give her another
chance. One of the boys was sent home
for the truck and the necessary gear.
“Better put some old hay in the truck,”
Dad called after him. “Don’t want her
hurl.” Susie was showing some interest
in life when the truck returned, and we
soon had everything ready and began
to haul away. On her upward journey,
Susie snatched a mouthful of hay as
she came level with the back of the truck,
and ic was quite something to see the
old girl, suspended ’twixt earth and
heaven, placidly munching, while we took
the strain and the truck was backed under
her.—“l.Q.”

Pulling-up at a wayside shack in out-
back Queensland to inquire about
roads, I noticed through the open door-
way that the wall inside was covered with
figures, each group being cancelled with
a diagonal stroke. “Yes,” drawled the
old bloke at the door, “I reckon I’ve
made a lot of money out of Caskets.
Before every drawing I write down a
number, and so far I’ve saved about two-
hundred quid. I had one loss, though,”
he remarked reminiscently. “How
come?” I inquired. “Well,” he said, “I
once wrote down a figure and when the
Casket was drawn it won five quid.—

To watch abos. flushing a mob
of flock-pigeons drinking at a water-
hole is to see neatly synchronised action.
One of them sounds the shrill whistle
of alarm to denote a hawk about to
strike. As the birds rise in panic to
escape, another abo. sends a bark
boomerang whizzing through the air.
The birds, mistaking it for the hawk,
dive for the shelter of the coolibahs
lining the bank, and it’s from among
those trees that the rest of the waiting
hunters launch their real boomerangs.
The whole operation is over in a matter
of seconds, and the throwers’ marksman-
ship is something to marvel at. —

IN THE WAKE OF THE BOOM
'T'hat we have had a boom,
developing into a danger-
ous one, over the past 18
months or two years, any
Bulletin reader must be fully
aware. Much time and space
have been given to the matter
in these pages, usually at least
six months to a year ahead of
any public warning being
issued by a Federal Govern-
ment authority on the same
subject.
The economic demoralisa-
tion that has occurred in the
economy over the past 18
months took on an accelerated
pace when Federal Parliamen-
tarians voted themselves large
pay-rises in the first half of
1959. However justified these
may have been on economic
grounds they were entirely out
of political season during a
period of wage-freezing and
decline in the price of wool.
They were, in fact, soon
followed by a 155.-a-week
increase in the basic wage and
a much larger addition to
wages through the granting of
increased margins to the metal-
workers at the end of 1959.
Similar margins-increases soon
spread throughout the
economy.
Since then cost has been
piled onto cost, and creeping
inflation has shown signs of
galloping again. Costs have
been rising at a pace
reminiscent of the demoralis-
ing days before the wage-
freeze. And prices for our
export products have, in the
main, been falling. Other
countries were already curbing
inflation while various public
authorities in Australia were
promoting it.
In spite of its great expan-
sion and increase in mechani-
cal efficiency, industry has not
been able to pass on to share-
holders a reward anything like
that being reaped by wage-
earners in industry during the
same time.
Increased money flowing to
wage-earners has stimulated
consumer-spending, which has
been inflated by the hire-
purchase boom.
There has been a great
speculative boom on the Stock
Exchanges based on hopes in
the distant future, but not on
dividends being paid at
present. Investors have, in
fact, run to industrial ordinary
shares as a refuge from the
very inflation that we have
just discussed. They have
“Thank goodness someone's come at last."
tended to avoid Common-
wealth loans as an investment,
have in every way sought to
escape punitive taxation, and
have created a fantastic boom
in ordinary shares as a result.
In this way they were abetted
by an inflow of speculative
capital from overseas.
It was the investment side
of industry which the Govern-
ment selected to bear the cost
of its own salary-rises and all
those other wage-costs which
followed. Investors, through
their industrial and financial
Investments, were asked to
absorb these increases, and a
pointed inducement to do so
was added by the removal of
import-restrictions. In other
words, swim, loaded with
extra costs, in a sea of imports,
or sink.
In the midst of this cost-
created inflation there was a
boom in land and other things.
This was certainly on the way
before fuel was added to
wage-inflation. But impetus
was given to it by the greater
spending-power put into the
hands of wage-earners at a
critical moment.
No wonder, in view of the
salary- and wage-rises of the
past two years, Mr. Holt, the
Federal Treasurer, finds that
“excessive internal demand
must be reduced to safeguard
Australia’s overseas funds posi-
tion.” Imports are running
too high, exports are lower
than last year, and overseas
reserves are falling “quite
rapidly.” _
Some of the Government’s
proposed remedies, through
the agency of the Reserve
Bank and the banking system,
are understandable enough.
There are to be attempts to
reduce liquidity, and to extend
credit to export industries
rather than to importers. In

But however much it ft
desirable that the hire-purchal

intention of disallowing as a
business expense (for taxation
purposes) any interest paid on
loans in excess of that paid in
1959-60 is an outrageous
misuse of the taxation laws,-

taxes and restrictions will be
to inhibit the issue of new
capital and the raising of new
loan-money, and to restrict
expansion in all industries.
This will force consolidation
on many concerns that have
been expansive during the past
few years, and it may be that
they will become more profit-
able more quickly in these cir-
cumstances. At the same time
they will not be quite the
“growth” stocks that they have
been hitherto.
In the case of Allied Mills
and Gillespie’s (both of Syd-
ney), these two cos. have boldly
gone for capital-issues during
the past two years when other
cos. were finessing with con-
vertible notes, options and the
like. Neither has a very big
“interest quota.”
Pick Your Marks
At a time like the present,
with the sharemarket
down over 20 p.c. on the peak
of September 26, and with
fluctuations in the level of
prices likely from day to day,
it is a good idea for the inves-
tor with money in hand to
study “form” among the
investments available, and to
watch his opportunities of buy-
ing first-class stocks at lower
prices in a fluctuating market.
He should pick out a few
stocks which he feels sure are
good, and wait for them to
come down to his price, then
buy without hesitation.
1.C.1., for example, is a
first-class stock, and it could
have been bought at 535. 6d. in
Sydney on Wednesday and at
545. in Melbourne. By Monday
buyers were offering 665. 6d.,
with no sellers in sight.
The person who had been
regretting that he hadn’t
bought 1.C.1. before it touched
its peak of 90s. earlier this year
had a wonderful opportunity
at 535. 6d.
It isn’t much use being very
wide-eyed when bargains are
offering unless you have been
wide-eyed beforehand and
made an appraisement of the
virtues of many stocks in
advance.
Selective study beforehand is
the thing.
It needs firm knowledge of
the merits or otherwise of a
stock to be able to buy it with
confidence in a sharemarket
collapse. Therefore the idea
should be to concentrate on
stocks of merits which will not
be specially assailed by the
Federal Government’s arbi-
trary action to check inflation
and over-importing.
Stocks in this category
worth watching are W. R. Car-
penter, Kandos Cement and
Australian Cement, A.W.A.,
F. J. Walker, Millaquin Sugar,
Mt. Isa, Allied Mills, Union
Carbide, N.K.S. Holdings,
Australian Gypsum (and Vic-
tor and Peninsula), R. Fowler,
James Stedman Henderson,
Newbold Refractories, G. E.
Crane, Cuming Smith, Minster,
as well as all the key industrials,
provided they happen to have
fallen heavily enough in the
market.
Nearly everyone has had an
opportunity of buying his pet
stocks at much lower prices
over the past week. Some
stocks were available at
bargain prices.
For those who missed out
the advice here is to study the
stocks that interest you, assess
their merits, select the ones
with outstanding possibilities
and wait for further “downs”
in the market to enable you to
buy at a price to fit in with
your calculations.
They Bought Nothing
Tt was amazing how many
keen investors, in last
week’s shattered market, fin-
ished-up missing all the bar-
gains because they set their
limits too low. Of course, 1.C.1.
at 535. 6d„ B.H.P. at 775. 6d.,
A.C.I. at 685., C.S.R. at £64
7s. 6d., A.W.A. at 235. 9d. and
Millaquin Sugar at 325. weren’t
available for long. And people
have become unused to picking
the bottom of falling markets.
However, some of the biggest
life-oftices at the moment aren’t
buying. And the future atti-
tude of the superannuation
funds has yet to be demon-
strated.

Joan Littlewood of London’s
Theatre Workshop first pro-
duced the play and has obvi-
ously had a hand in the final
draft. Miss Littlewood, we are
told, believes that theatre
should be “grand, simple,
pathetic, but not genteel, not
poetical.” To this end she has
introduced certain Brechtian de-
vices: such a? an onstage jazz-
band that accompanies the
various characters in a variety
of music-hall songs and a large
amount of direct actor-to-audi-
ence parley. As with “The Hos-
tage” (another Theatre Work-
shop product, and currently
being staged at the Comedy
Theatre) the overall result is
that the play has simplicity, is
pathetic, avoids gentility, shuns
the poetical, but misses-out on
grandeur.
Both plays have a largesse,
but neither have sufficient in-
tellectual power to carry the
author’s personal vitality
through to full dramatic effect.
If George Ogilvie’s Union
Theatre production for the
U.T.R.C. is bright, fast-moving
and technically smooth, it is
also a little on the glib side.

“Artists and Models”
The apparition of Tivoli
vaudeville at Sydney Royal
while J.C.W.’s “Merry Widow”
waltzes at the Tivoli, was made
more credible by the familiar-
ity of the title and of the rou-
tines of Johnny Lockwood and
Freddie Bamberger, which
stirred the memory of the re-
viewer no less than did the lush
young nudes, reappearing after
long absence from Tivoli shows.

They toil not, neither do they
spin, those nudes, and certainly
Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed as one of these, but
vaudeville never seems to do
its best without them. Not only
did the nudes bring a pearly
gleam to the eye of this vaude-
ville, but also its stridencies
were muted by the vaude-
villian’s pathetic awe at play-
ing on boards hallowed by a
great dramatic tradition: Lock-
wood’s acts, as a lad smoking
and drinking for the first time
and showing how men would
behave if they gave tea-parties
like women, and Bamberger’s
piano-act and husband-and-
wife act, already commanding
the veneration due to age,

Borovansky Ballet
There can be no question that
Peggy van Praagh has brought
new qualities to the Borovan-
sky Ballet, and these were well
to the fore in the two opening


performances of the Com-
pany’s 1960 Melbourne season
at Her Majesty’s—in a strength-
ening of discipline in ensemble
dancing, and a sense of overall
artistic confidence. Not that
Borovansky was ever lacking
in these qualities, but now they
seem to be stressed.
One reservation though: if the
Company hopes to transport us
into areas of response like those
we experienced during the visits
to this country of the English
Royal Ballet Company and the
Bolshoi Ballet in recent years
it will have to concentrate much
more on achieving that exhilar-
ating fusion of choreography,
music and decor that we find
in those two overseas com-
panies. And this kind of ex-
pressiveness, unique to ballet,
cannot be attained through
technique alone: it can only
be done through placing more
and more emphasis on the
relationships of individual
dancers to other members of
the company, to the line of the
music, and the thread of the
story, and so on.
A breakdown in this was
the only real fault in the Corn-
pany’s excellent work in
“Coppelia,” and “Les Rendez-
vous” on the opening night.
In the second programme the
Company reached its peak so
far in “Les Amants Eternels.”
The dancing of Grinwis himself
as the Spirit of Death and of
Mary Duchesne as the Spirit of
Love was magnificent. Tschai-
kowsky’s music at times made
demands too severe on the
orchestra.

i“ y ls hay ing a rush of
s art-bargains with
twelve-guinea shows
Galleries
Farmer’s Blaxland Galleries
and at the All Nations Club.
Whether these shows are
really to the benefit of artists
is debatable. On the one hand,
a sale is always a sale for these
poor struggling heroes. On the
other hand if you take off 25
per cent, commission to the gal-
lery (the All Nations Club
doesn’t charge it), and about
two-pounds for the frame, all
that’s really left for the artist
out of a ten-guinea sale is
£5/8/6. You’d need fantastic
sales to average the basic wage
over the year.
Maybe next year the galleries
or the art societies should put
their heads together and ensure
that at least fifteen-guineas is
set as the minimum: twenty
would really be more in line
with other contemporary prices.
However, in the meantime
there are certainly some superb
bargains for buyers, and they
have taken full advantage of
them: the Blaxland, by midday
on the opening day, had sold
56 paintings and more were
going all the time.
All this work is, of course,
far too numerous to mention,
especially as one hasn’t seen
the All Nations show. But in a
lively mixed lot at the Clune
Galleries a small abstract by
Margo Lewers, “Houses on the
Hill” by Maximilian Feuerring
and “Gum Leaves” by Hal
Boyer caught the eye ; and at
the Blaxland are an exception-
ally attractive pink landscape
by A. J. Murch, with Ivan
Englund’s “W ate r w a y,”
Edward Hall’s “Harbor Im-
pression,” Margaret Coen’s
“Roses” on silk, Judy Hepper’s
“Pink Gouache” and John Og-
burn’s fetching “Spring Study.”

From Herbert Holman
C|ir Alan Herbert’s commit-
tee and the Society of
Authors worked for five years
to get the Obscene Publications
Act, 1959, on the Statute Bill.
Their efforts were directed
against the wowser type of
mind which could ban a work
of literary merit because some
passages, wrested from the
book as a whole, were held
to be indecent or obscene.
They sought, and achieved, an
adult, informed and respon-
sible approach to literature.
Now, as the first important
consequence of this act, the
whole nation knows what
Lady Chatterley’s Lover is
about and a very large pro-
portion of it can’t wait until
the 3s. 6d. paperbacks reach
the bookstalls.
The trial, however factually
it was reported in the news-
papers, appealed to the public
as sensational. According to
some observers, it was very
dull. The chief points of
interest, on the spot, were the
eulogies of most of the wit-
nesses (whose extravagant
claims cancelled each other
out) and the apparent in-
efficiency of the Crown
prosecution—the technique of
cross-examination, with over-
emphasis and a suggestion of
hectoring, made a very poor
showing against at least one
witness of high intellect. And
the big doubt was whether
caution, enhanced by prudish-
ness, would lose the case for
the defence. There was,
indeed, some surprise at the
result.
What will be the effect? On
the one hand, authors Of
serious intent will feel less
inhibited. On the other, there
should be fewer, rather than
more, pornographic books
(these have been freely and
publicly available in Soho for
years). It is possible that the
police will begin a drive against
this stuff. Convictions should
not be difficult, since the
defence will be unable to pro-
duce “expert witnesses” which,
as with the recent case, are an
essential requirement of the
1959 Act.
There is a strong opinion
that the prosecution of Penguin
Books was an untimely
blunder. D. H. Lawrence’s
reasons for writing the book
are known and his integrity
as a serious novelist is un-
assailable. Yet to free it from
the censor’s ban does not mean
that it is suitable for general
circulation as a moral tract.
(One correspondent asks
whether it will now be included
in the schools’ syllabus for
Eng. Lit.)
Other works, more marginal
in character, such as Lolita,
may have proved wiser choices
as test-cases. But the irony
of the affair is that thousands
of people, interested in neither
Lawrence nor literature, will
buy and read the book out of
the kind of curiosity which the
Obscene Publications Act is
intended to stifle.
A Rum Do
Drink is not the social evil
it was in our grandfathers’
days. Nor is drunkenness on
the stage an effective device,
after its over-employment in
old-fashioned melodrama.
Perhaps the last instance of
a successful play which
depended upon the moral
degradation of the central
character was “White Cargo.”
That was thirty-five years ago,
and, even so, alcoholism was
secondary to the “damp rot”
of a tropical outpost. As late
as. 1931 (“Cavalcade”) the
appearance of the intoxicated
butler had lost dramatic force,
and the incident, of the
drunken hostess in “Big Ben”
(1946) was too contrived to be
funny.
It is rather astonishing that
stage-room should have been
found for “Chin-Chin”
(Wyndham’s Theatre), adapted
from the French of Francois
Billetdoux by Willis Hall,
which recites the slope down-
wards of a man and woman
whose partners have united in
an affaire.
Cesa r e o Grimaldi, an
Italian, has taken French
nationality, and Pamela Puffy-
Picq has married a successful
Parisian doctor. They meet
in a cheap Parisian cafe to
decide what to do. Cesareo, a
successful contractor, is already

compared with the 400 sheep

He has established a successful
Polwarth stud.
At the start Bradley assessed
the main factor in develop-
ment to be control of erosion,
Principal cause of erosion on
the property was heavy run-
off from disused gravel-pits,
which had resulted in the for-
mation of gullies—sometimes
12ft. deep—and had cut
through valuable land, making
any such work as top-dressing
GROUND PLAN, 1960 FIELD DAYS.
a very difficult operation. He
decided that the most import-
ant thing was to subdivide, and
so allow pasture-improvement
and rotational grazing. This
also allowed him to get rid
of the rabbits, and then to
plant trees and give a top-
dressing of super., once he had
started on contour-cultivation.
For the first six years he set
about establishing improved-
pastures on the more easily
accessible parts of his land.
It had not been necessary to
cultivate on the contour except
on the steeper slopes. But
with erosion as bad as it was
at Jindalee, he had to make
use of the most vigorous
mechanical means of control-
ling run-off. He built absorp-
tion - banks, diversion - banks
and soil-saving dams, and he
ripped some areas extensively
to increase absorption. Some-
times he filled gullies to pre-
vent danger to stock, or to
give access to areas for top-
dressing.
The hillside to the north-
east of this year’s field-days
site is an interesting example.
It was treated in 1955. Origin-
ally the gravel-pit on top of
the hill had caused deep gullies
down the slope, because of its
excessive run-off —the water-
course to the north of the
gravel-pit had gullies 10ft.
deep. Bradley stabilised this
area by building banks and
dams and by contour-ripping,
fenced it off, sowed pasture-
species, and made use of it for
grazing large numbers of stock
for two or three days at a
time.
The Soil Conservation Ser-
vice, using its own plant and
working under the advances
scheme, helped on another
hillside by constructing dams,
a diversion-bank and a
“dribble-pipe baulk,” which
was then new to the district,
Now there’s another project
under way at Jindalee, in which
the Water Conservation and
Irrigation Commission have
helped. A major dam is to
be constructed, holding I\-
million gallons, on Bradley’s
property. This year facilities
for earthmoving demonstra-
tions were therefore the best
ever. Machines carried-out
actual construction-work on
this project during the Field
Days. Earthworks on this dam
involved moving 5500 cubic-
yards.
This progressive property
made an ideal site for the 1960
meeting.
Of course, Clyde Bradley
gains advantage from it, but
it is important to remember
that he has put his property
at the disposal of the Field
Days Committee and grown
crops to suit demonstrations
the committee required.
Incidentally, he has had to
pull-up a lot of fencing and
accept a lot of nuisance-value
traffic on his land. It is also
important to remember that he
is a soldier-settler who has
been a battler, particularly in
these last couple of years when
sheep have not been profitable.
The Setting
Orange is always lovely in
spring. By some curious streak
of good fortune, each year it
seems to rain on the week-
end before the Field Days, so
that the country is looking its
best for the important time,
and then the rain holds-off.
(This year it rained on the
Thursday, but the first two days
were perfect.)
There was a tremendous
storm on the Saturday ; but by
Monday it was perfect weather.
With cloudless skies and cold
nights, trees in leaf and
flowers blooming in the
gardens, the land green and
smiling, Orange and the sur-
rounding country were ready
to receive visitors.
I arrived on Sunday even-
ing, happy to return to the
hospitality of the Canobolas
Club and to revive friend-
ships made on previous visits.
Preview
On Monday I went out, with
committee - chairman Hugh
Jackson, to see what was hap-
pening at Jindalee.
It is always interesting to
look at the seamy side of a
big event, when all kinds of
unforeseen hitches may crop-
up and when you can judge


the efficiency of the organisa-
tion stretched to its utmost.
In this particular instance
there was no hitch. Jackson
told me that he had had some
troubles over the weekend
(troubles always happen then,
when everyone is out of com-
mission), but that the commit-
tee had been able to compete.
New exhibitors were still
coming in. This seemed sur-
prising, because the Orange
National Field Days should
by now be fairly well known
throughout the Common-
wealth. But the committee
had kept vacant blocks for
them, so there was no worry.
We drove round the 1200-
yard frontage of exhibitors’
display-blocks—this year there
were 70—and came back to
the control h.-q., located in a
superseded double-decker bus.
Lunching on the top-deck—
where the public - address
station was to be located —
and looking over the whole
area, I recognised how well the
site had been chosen. Every-
thing could be seen from that
position: demonstration areas
for ploughing, baling and
earthmoving were all within
sight and the announcers were
in a fine position from which
to control them.
Afterwards I walked round
the display-blocks. This is the
only chance you have of really
talking to people, because they
are too busy once the crowds
arrive. As you walk round
you’ll shake hands and swap
yarns. Or some new invention
may strike you, and you’ll go
over to talk to the men
putting-on finishing touches.
The day before the Field
Days open is always exciting.
Machines are there, not yet
grouped correctly and some-
times still in parts, all ready
to go when the time comes ;
but none of them has yet
shown its prowess. There's a
feeling of latent power about
the display-blocks. Mean-
while, tents, signposts and
bunting are going up. (This
year I thought there seemed
to be too many flags about the
place ; the strings of pennants
made the field look like a fair-
ground.) A canvas-town, with
streets, power-system, TV
aerials and caravans is being
constructed.
It's all an expression of
Australia’s primary develop-
ment. Everywhere you look
there’s someone doing some-
thing.
Indeed, the Orange National
Field Days Committee claim
that this show is the largest
exhibition and demonstration
of farm-machinery in the
world.
Walking round on Monday
afternoon, I noted that new
and useful signposts had been
put-up—all the signposting is
done by courtesy of William
Cooper and Nephews, and
painted orange and black.
Massey-Ferguson had a big
display of equipment ; so had
Fordson Combined Dealers,
Baltic Simplex, New Holland,
and International Harvesters.
I met Bob Alexander,
N.S.W. State - manager of
International Harvesters, and
heard his views on the value
of Orange Field Days.
B.F.E. (N.S.W.)—the com-
pany who lost Ferguson pro-
ducts on amalgamation with
M.-F. and then took on the
Fiat line—produced a large
exhibition-block, including a
model of the original Fiat
tractor.

shown a profit, had their
Champion and Countryman
tractors on show.
A self-opening gate was
shown by C. W. Armstrong
and Co., Orange. Invented by
R. E. and Peter Abbey, of
Bathurst, it was entered five
days too late for this year's
New Implement Award. The
Lehmann tractor - mounted
saw-unit also looked effective.
Befco Distributors, of Albury
(N.S.W.), are its Australia-
wide distributors.
Official Opening
Laurence C. Vass, U.S.
Consul-General in Australia,
who was to perform the official
opening, arrived in Orange on
the afternoon of October 14
and was welcomed to a civic
reception that evening by
Mayor Alan Ridley. Charles
Cutler, M.L.A. for Orange and
Leader of the N.S.W.. Country
party, and John England,
newly-elected M.P. for Cslare,
were both at this reception.
Dr. Arthur Colvin, nowadays
living in Sydney, but at present
spending a fortnight in Orange,
was also there.
Consul - General Vass
officially opened the Field Days
at Jindalee on November 15.
He described the Field Days
as being the most remarkable
of their kind in the world.
Although not a farmer him-
self, he said, he could appre-
ciate the merits of such an
occasion, which brought people
in their thousands to study
what was new in farming.
Then he presented the Welding
Awards and New Implement
Awards of Merit to successful
competitors.
Welding Awards
The Welding Awards are
given for designs made by
primary-producers. Points of
judging are: quality of work-
manship, particularly of weld-
ing ; practical usefulness of
the article; originality of
design ; and economy in appli-
cation of materials,
The prize-money for this
award was donated this year
by Schick and Semmler (weld-
ing-equipment manufacturers);
J F. Aylmer and Co., of
Orange ; Aston Electrical Pro-
ducts Pty., Ltd., of Sydney ;
and C.I.G. (N.S.W.) Pty., Ltd.,
of Sydney,
Winner was I. C. Thorn-
craft, of Summer Hill, Bathurst
Road, Orange, with his foot-
rot-cradle. A. B. Hazelton, of
Toogong, via Cudal, came next
with a portable workshop;
and A. Maybin, of Gilgad,
Orange, was third with a
trailer,
New Implement. Awards

This section was introduced
at the 1956 Field Day. The

Round the Exhibits
Starting at Block No. IA, I
watched the Monier Earth
Drilling Company’s well-
boring equipment at work and
then made my way along the
line of exhibits.
Hewett and Neal, of Orange,
were showing the Myers liquid-
manure spreader (award-winner)
on their stand for the first time
in N.S.W. This machine will
spread all waste-matter that
collects about bails and cow-
yards over pastures. With a
capacity of 300 gals. and oper-
ated by a vacuum-pump (which
fills the tank as well as spreads)
it gives even coverage over a
range of 40ft.
This spreader will handle
both solids and liquids, and
may be used as a fire-cart,
water-trailer or weedicide-
sprayer as well.
Since its invention this
sprayer has been most popular
with dairyfarmers in Victoria.
Hewett and Neal also had on
display the David Brown 850
implement-tractor (similar to
the 950 launched last Decem-
ber) with all-purpose hydraulic
system and differential lock.
Western Stores (distributors
for Dangar, Gedye and Mal-
loch) showed the new Bamford
baler, and Lysaght’s revolu-
tionary new, silo was com-
pletely assembled and demon-
strated each day.
Southern Cross Machinery,
further along the line, were
showing a complete new range
of irrigation equipment, and
another of air-cooled diesel-
engines, designed for irrigation
pumping and all power require-
ments—-all at an attractive
price and apparently economic
to run.
Prefabricated Buildings and
Other Things
R. and N. Building Trading
Co. had a prefabricated hay-
shed ; a machinery-shed and
part of a bulk - grain shed
erected on the site.
Aston Electrical Products
were showing a completely
weatherproof portable welder.
Kept under a shower of water
all the morning, it still worked.
Pope Products showed a new
sprayline which can be towed
intact from paddock to pad-
dock: S. M. Stansmore nearby
had the Davey Hi-lift jet-pump
on show, capable of lifting
water from 140 ft. for irriga-
tion. Col Smith, of Singleton
(N.S.W.), had the Greenfli

The Tritter; More Tractors
Yeomans Pty., Ltd., had the
Tritter forager on show again
and this, as well as the Keyline
diagrams and chisel-plough also
in the tent, attracted consider-
able attention.
Passing the time of day again
with Bob Alexander in the
International Harvester display-
block, I learned that the secre-
tary of the I.H. Co. had come
to the Field Days from
America. (Incidentally, manag-
ing-directors of six large manu-
facturing concerns attended the
Field Days, with many more
senior executives.) We had a
look at International’s new
TDS crawler-tractor, which
with its light tread and low sil-
houette —it’s just 47yin. from
ground to bonnet-top—should,
interest orchardists. This tractor
has a low speed of one mile an
hour, with second and third
speeds still under 2 m.p.h., and
altogether 10 forward speeds,
with 6.54 m.p.h. in top.
Sod-seeder, etc.
Grasslands’ display - block
showed their Bft. trailing sod-
seeder and hye-shank cultivator,
useful for sowing seed into
existing native pastures and,
Grasslands claim, the first of
its type in Australia. They
export their equipment all over
the world and have recently
sent a big shipment to Uruguay
and Argentina, I was told.
Nuffield products were on
show for the first time at
Orange.
Aircraft in Agriculture
On F. W. Williams (Rural)
stand I had an opportunity to
discuss the use of aircraft in
agriculture. There was,, in fact,
quite a little air-pageant at
Jindalee throughout this year’s
Field Days.
Planes were supplied by
Boulton and Dutton* of Cano-
windra (N.S.W.), Hazelton Air
Services and Hazair Agricul-
tural Services, from Orange, as
well as by F. W. Williams, who
were demonstrating the Piper
Pawnee, for which they are
agents and which is designed
specifically for agricultural
work, and they also brought
the Piper Aztec six-seater
transport-plane for demonstra-
tion and display. The airstrip
was also used by private air-
craft.
Hammermill; Prefabricated
Buildings
Agricultural Services, Pty.,
Ltd. (Agserv), of Pendle Hill,
N.S.W., had the new series 9A
Hy-Put hammermill on show,
with a new range of misting
machines, some jetting equip-
ment and boom-sprays.
Econo Products, Ltd., not
very far away, had a range of
steel-framed rural buildings
which supplemented that
already described in the R. and
N. display. Machinery sheds,
sheep shelter-sheds, carports
and utility sheds, they have
these all available and pre-
cision -built for quick economi-
cal erection.
Government Departments
and the Stock Exchange
In the tents sent up round
the field-day h.q., Government
departments had established
their information centres. The
Department of Agriculture had
some excellent exhibits and was
running a free farm-water test-
ing service during the three
days. It also had an excellent
series of samples of weeds on
display. The Forestry Com-
mission, the Soil Conservation
Service and Orange Technical
College wool-department ware
also represented by carefully
arranged demonstrations, and
there were experts available to
give advice to any enquirers.
Most interesting experiment of
all, though, was a series of lec-
tures given each day by
Lieutenant - Colonel F. B.
Mitchell who is operations-
manager of the Sydney Stock
Exchange. The aim of these
lectures was to tell the
audience a little about how the
Stock Exchange works, explain-
ing the post-system of trading
and describing what happens
when an investor buys a
security. These lectures were
deservedly popular.
Comparative Demonstrations
All the time, in the centre of
the arena, on the hillside and
on the dam-site, comparative
demonstrations of ploughing
and cultivating equipment,
earthmoving, baling, sawing,
etc., were going on.
To a practical farmer this
is the most interesting part of
the Field Days because here he
can see the performance of the
respective machines in identi-
cal conditions.
This is the part that makes
the Field Days so valuable and
attracts the most interest.
Demonstrations took place in
W. L. Underwood’s orchard 3|
miles away (near Borenore rail-
way-station) all day on Thurs-
day, November 17. A full
range of equipment for spray-
ing, cultivation and drainage
of orchards was shown.
Silage - making demonstra-
tions were also continuous all
Wednesday afternoon and on
Thursday morning. Each
demonstrator had an area
allotted to him and was allowed
to choose his own method of
storage (subject to Clyde Brad-
ley's agreement).
Administration
The whole three days were
as usual well organised and
attendances were up to stan-
dard (encouraging the first two
days but falling off on Thurs-
day because of rain). It was
evident that the committee had
taken note of the small points
which slightly marred previous
year’s exhibitions.
For instance, war was waged
on the flies, which were trouble-
some on Monday’s preview but
much less noticeable on the
actual open days. The area of
display-blocks was sprayed
early each morning with D.D.T.
from Boulton and Dutton’s air-
craft, which used a special mix-

ture supplied by Imperial
Chemical Industries in co-
operation with the health
authorities.
For the ninth year in succes-
sion Torch Bearers for Orange
Legacy prepared lunches for
exhibitors and spectators.
Under the presidency of Mrs.
D. Cormack, they produced
turkey-rolls, ham-rolls, sand-
wiches, tea and soft drinks at
very reasonable prices, both on
the main ground and at the
orchard demonstrations. The
route to the refreshment-tent and
booths was plainly signposted.
Even on the Monday, a team of
Torch Bearers prepared lunch
for the 200 organisers and drove
round the ground asking if any
of the workers needed refresh-
ments. It is possibly not known
that, in order to have the

Conclusion
Altogether, the 1960
Orange Field Days once more
surpassed expectations. Any-
one who imagines the amount
of extra work which must go
on behind the scenes before
they can reach this standard
each year will praise Hugh
Jackson and his committee for
the immense effort they put into
the job in their spare time
(because they have all got their
own work to do as well as
organising the Field Days).
That is what makes me
wonder whether now the rieia
Days are not growing too big
to be handled by this pure ,
voluntary effort. It seef ™

a full growth, they are valu-
able pasture-components and
in suitable districts are worth
seeding into the swards.
Burr-medic or burr-clover
(Medicago denticulata ) is a
hardy plant which produces
excellent fodder and is specially
suited for growing on dry
land or hillsides. Of trailing
habit, it’s a prolific seeder,
producing coiled, disk-shaped
seed-pods with hooked spines
which form the burr that gives
its name. Making its greatest
growth in mid-spring, it dies
off in hot weather, leaving the
ground covered with burrs
which provide nutritious food
for stock. The great dis-
advantage of this medic is the
hooked spines on the burr;
they adhere to sheeps’ fleeces
and spoil the wool.
Burr-medic makes excellent
green - manure. Sown in
autumn at 101 b. to the acre,
the plants should be ploughed
under in the spring before they
seed.
Woolly burr-medic (Medi-
cago minima), smaller and
hardier than burr-medic, is
more resistant to drought.
The pods, with four or five
spirals partly separated and
covered with slender spines
fin. long, cling to wool.
While not as common as burr-
medic, it forms dense mats of
herbage when grown on hills
in the wheat-belt; and it makes
fodder.
Barrel - medic, or barrel-
clover ( Medicago tribuloides),
is the most important of the
medics. It thrives in areas
where subterranean-clover will
not succeed, and it gives a big
bulk of feed during the spring
months. This medic grows
well on a minimum of mois-
ture, being more drought-
resistant than any of the other
medics or clovers. Like all
legumes, it enriches the soil,
and will eradicate weeds and
inferior medics. Sow at the
rate of lib. to 41b. an acre,
and not more than yin. deep
On Queensland’s Northern
Downs this medic is showing
great promise in mixtures with
green-panic and buffel-grass.
Its burr is large, but with
short spines which do not
adhere to wool. They are
produced prolifically and, as
with burr-medic, form nutriti-
ous feed in summer after the
plants have died down.
Black-medic, or English tre-
fo i 1 ( Medicago lupinina),
thrives on almost any soil, but
does best if the ground is cal-
careous, because lime helps its
growth. Best isuited to cool
districts, this medic gives excel-
lent fodder when grown with
other clovers, especially on
light land. Sow 151 b. of seed
to the acre if sown alone, or
21b. in mixtures.
Stock-stealing
“Nyara”: Heavier sentences
for stock-stealing were urged
in a resolution unanimously
carried by the Southern Table-
lands District Council of the
N.S.W. Graziers’ Association
at a meeting in Goulburn.
One delegate pointed out that
bonds had been given in two
recent cases of stock-stealing,
one at Grafton and one at
Parramatta. This, he said,
could be considered almost an
encouragement to steal stock.
With the present high values
there was an inducement to
steal, and, moreover, stock-
stealing was a premeditated
crime, usually highly organised.
A delegate from Berrima said
that stealing was encouraged if
people who did not have
permits were allowed to move
stock ; several delegates, how-
ever, insisted that control in the
issue of permits was strict
enough in their districts.
A motion was carried to the
effect that where a branch was
dissatisfied with the control of
the issue of permits it should
take the matter up with the
issuing authority, the local P.P.
Board.
N.T. Cattle
“A.C.T.”: At the end of
June the cattle-population of
the Northern Territory was
about 1,100,000, and exports
for the year totalled 137,192
head: —76,782 to Queensland,
45,072 to South Australia, 8828
to Western Australia and 6510
to Hong Kong.
The year’s total turnoff was
worth £4.8 million —a record
for the Territory. In addition
to the increasing trade with
Hong Kong, nine shipments
totalling 8921 head were sent
by sea from Darwin to Queens-
land coastal abattoirs to supply
meat for the boneless-beef trade
with the U.S.
There is growing interest in
the Territory in slaughtering
and meat-processing, and also
in the Angliss plan for new
abattoirs at Darwin.
Some refrigerated meat was
sent to South Australia, and the
year also saw the useful start
in jnter-State trade in pet-food
made from buffalo-meat. About
2500 buffalo carcasses, produc-
ing 400 tons of boned-out pet-
meat, were processed during the
year.


TIGHTENING-UP IN NEW ZEALAND
HThe market for New Zealand
shares has suffered its
sharpest setback since July,
1958, when Mr. Nordmeyer
announced his plans for taxa-
tion of dividends.
Falls have heavily out-
numbered rises. They repre-
sented simply the crumbling
of boom prices.
Investors could no longer
ignore the chill breeze blow-
ing through overseas markets.
Another sobering influence
was the increasing supply of
scrip. An indication of the
way things are going is given
by Capital Issues figures. New
finance approved in the first
nine months of this year
amounted to £19.1 million,
against £B.l million in the same
period last year.
A Reserve Bank move to
tighten credit through higher
reserve-ratios also helped to
weaken the sharemarket.
One encouraging point is the
firmness of wool values since
the initial fall at the opening
of the season.
However, the sharemarket
seems likely to remain sub-
dued for some time. Apart
from the rather clouded
world economic picture, the
approaching election can be
expected to have a quietening
influence.
Tighter Bank Credit
The reserve-ratios of the
trading-banks have been raised
from 34 per cent, of demand
liabilities and 10 per cent, of
time liabilities to 36 per cent,
and 10 per cent, respectively.
In announcing the increase
the Reserve Bank stated that
the new level implied a tighten-
ing in credit policy. This was
needed to check an exces-
sive expansion in monetary
demand, which was already
exerting a strong pressure on
resources and on the balance-
of-payments.
The banks have been
requested to effect a substan-
tial reduction in the rate at
which new overdrafts are
granted and to ensure that re-
payments of existing advances
are made in accordance with
individual arrangements be-
tween the banks and their
customers.
The demand for bank credit
has been rising during the
whole of 1960 and the level
of bank overdrafts in October
was, on average, £21,000,000,
or 12 per cent, higher than a
year ago. Moreover the rate
of increase has accelerated in
recent months.
The operation of the reserve-
ratios has for some time past
been limiting the amount of
free cash held by the banks
and causing individual banks
to borrow for short periods
from the Reserve Bank.
The policy is now strength-
ened by lifting the reserve-
ratios to a level which will
increase both the amount of
the banks’ borrowing from the
Reserve Bank and the period
for which it remains out-
standing.
Overseas Funds Decline
One of the reasons for the
Reserve Bank’s action can be
seen in the downward trend
of overseas funds.
Net overseas assets of the
banking system, at £90.2 mil-
lion on October 26, were
£7.5 million less than a year
before. Assets were at a peak
of £118.7 million at the end
of June. Since then they have
fallen steadily by a total of
£28.5 million. Part of the fall
is seasonal, but part is attribut-
able to increased imports
arising from greater business
activity and from relaxation
of controls. In the first nine
months of the calendar year
private imports, at £lB2 mil-
lion, were £37 million higher
than in the corresponding
period last year. Export
receipts were only £7 million
higher at £242 million.
During the year ended Sep-
tember, 1960, a deficit of £6.2
million was recorded in N.Z.’s
overseas exchange transactions,
compared with a surplus of
£4l million for the year ended
September, 1959.
The year's transactions on a
current- and capital-account
basis showed on current
account a surplus of £4.2 mil-
lion, compared with a surplus
of £24.5 million for the year
ended September, 1959, and a
deficit of £54.9 million for the
year to September, 1958.
Export receipts increased by
£16,400,000 to £313,135,000.
This was due to increased
receipts for wool and “other”
exports offset by lower
receipts for butter, cheese and
meat.
Although butter prices were
higher during the year com-
pared with the year ended
September, 1959, the volume
of sales was much lower. Thus
receipts for butter fell from
£56,100,000 to £54,900,000.
A smaller volume of sales
at lower prices than during
the previous September year
resulted in a fall in receipts
for cheese of £3,300,000 to
£19,052,000.
The fall in receipts for meat
from £77,800,000 to £75,100,000
was due to the low prices
ruling during the last quarter
of 1959 and to the fact that
since the increases in the
British bank-rate from 4 to 5
per cent, in January, 1960, and
to 6 per cent, in June, 1960,

private imports of £36.800 000

ments to £243,000,000. R e la

with increased business activity
during 1960, were the main
factors causing higher private
imports.
Nelson’s Cotton-mill
Tenders for the building of
Nelson’s cotton-mill will be
called early next year and the
mill will go into production
early in 1962.
A variety of fabrics will be
spun, woven and finished at
the mill. The industry will be
developed over a 10-year
period.
The New Zealand Cotton
Company, registered in Wel-
lington with an authorised
share-capital of £5 million on
August 12 this year, will
operate under the new name
of the Commonwealth Fabric

decorative laminates and the group’s steel

Subsidiaries contributed to group
results. Profits of New Zealand and
Bangkok cos. were satisfactory. Condi-
tions in Singapore improved slightly, but
remain difficult.
Group trading - profit for the year
ended June 30, 1960. (excluding the N.Z.
cos., Johnston Cardboard Box and The
Banks Box), was £219,966 higher at
£7,626,075. Income from investments
amounted to £390,126 (up £115,149).
Consolidated net earnings were dis-
closed at £2,336,885 (up £142,523), after
deducting directors’ and auditors’ fees,
taking-off £1,886,834 for depreciation (up
£95,063) and providing £2,565,091 for
taxation (up £62,709) calculated at pre-
Budget rates. New co. rates increased
group-liability by £135,000. Taking the
post-Budget rates into account the tax-
provision remains generous, correspond-
ing more to trading profits, less deprecia-
tion, than to disclosed net earnings.
The explanation probably lies in
massive transfers to various reserves and
provisions (totalling £1,085,000) deducted
from trading profits, net of tax, deprecia-
tion and directors’ and auditors’ fees
(£97,474). If these transfers are added-
back consolidated net profit increased by
£136,947 to £3,421,885:

was reflected in the higher book-values

demand for glass continues to rise in
Australia and overseas. A.C.I. stands to
benefit by the increasing use of glass
and fibre-glass for building purposes.
Wide diversification of interests affords
valuable protection against the vagaries
of competition.
Loan-capital is small. Expansion is
financed by issues of scrip at a premium,
and from internal resources. Share-
holders may benefit by future capital-
raisings.
At the last sale in Sydney the 20s.
ords. fetched 725. 6d. a unit, for an
immediate yield of 3.5 p.c. on the basis
of the amply covered p.c. div.-rate.
At this price the scrip looks interesting.

Berlei United, Ltd.
Costs continued to rise, and competi-
tion increased. But higher sales on
an expanding market resulted in a sub-
stantial growth in consolidated earnings.
The original business was set-up in a
corset-shop in Sydney 50 years ago, con-
verting to a public co., Unique Corsets,
Ltd., in 1912. The name was changed
to Berlei, Ltd., in a reconstruction in
1920.
Today Berlei United, Ltd., is a leading
manufacturer and distributor of popular
foundation-garments, marketing its pro-
ducts throughout Australia. There is a
worth-while export-trade, as well as
overseas manufacture, particularly in
the U.K. and N.Z., in which the group
is represented by the subsidiary Berlei
(U.K.), Ltd., of London and the
associate Berlei (N.Z.), Ltd., of Auckland.
Other subsidiaries are: Berlei, Ltd.
(Sydney), Berlei Pty. (Melbourne),
Warner’s “Le Gant” Pty. (Sydney) and
Berlei Staff Provident Management Pty.
(Sydney). Berlei United, Ltd., is purely
a holding-co.
Trading conditions continued to be
competitive. Group profits were
“generally satisfactory” due to a higher
volume of sales. Berlei (U.K.), Ltd.,
traded profitably in London. The N.Z.
co. had a comfortable year.
Group turnover increased by £714,145
to £5,820,471. Total manufacturing, dis-
tribution and administration costs
amounted to £5,321,291 (up £613,690),
including £80,745 depreciation provision
(up £4947). Consolidated net profit for
the year ended June 30, 1960, was £75,182
higher at £308,349:

After satisfying the unchanged pref.-
div. requirements (£4000), this was equi-
valent to an earning-rate of almost 30
p.c. on the average ord. capital, compared
with 21.5 p.c. in the previous term, 30.3
p.c. in 1958, 32.2 p.c. in 1957 and 38.1
p.c. in 1956 (all on smaller capital).
Ord. div.-rate was steady at a well-
covered 10 p.c. (£102,672). Total reserves
and undistributed profits were disclosed
at £1,349,067 free of intangibles.
During the year 7400 20s. ords. were
issued at a premium of 30s. a unit in
acquisition of factory premises at Punch-
bowl (Sydney). The conversion of prefs.
to ords., and the one-for-four par-issue
aftfer the books were ruled off, raised paid
capital to £1,289,725 at October 31, 1960.

After the balance-date, 50,000 8 p.c.
20s. prefs. were converted to ords. (one
20s. ord. for each two 20s. prefs.). This
was followed by the issue of £263,000
20s. ords., one-for-four at par. Ord.
capital issued in the conversion of prefs.
(25,000 ss. units) participated.
Berlei appears to be in a sound finan-
cial position. However, the market re-
mains highly competitive. Changing
consumer-tastes present problems. All
this necessitates large outlays on adver-
tising and sales-promotion, and eats into
earnings. Further cost-increases could be
embarrassing if rivalry within the indus-
try keeps prices pinned down.
At the last sale in Sydney the 20s.

Last year results were adversely affected
by a slump in the second half-term
Leather exports became unprofitable due
to a shortage of suitable local hides
which had forced-up prices above world
parity. This was accompanied by a heaw
fall in hide and leather prices on the
open world markets.
Trading in wool and sheepskins began
well, but in the second half-year dedin- i
ing wool prices narrowed-down profit-
margins. However, the overall sales- i
volume increased substantially. The
“high rate of turnover was fully main- j
tained.” Turnover in the co.’s stock-
owners’ service and agricultural products i
improved despite drought conditions in
Q., S.A. and western N.S.W.
Govan Pty. had a good year, but Pesti-
cides, Ltd., the Adelaide subsidiary, was
affected by drought and incurred another
loss. Operations on the Sydney Greasy
Wool Futures Exchange, of which Wilcox
Mofflin is an original floor-member, were
successful.

Then he saw the gatepost,
Andrew had cut his turn a bit
fine and the overhang of the
logs had pushed one of the
gateposts aside like a twig in
a mud-patch. Chislom raced
out of his office, across the
dusty log-yard and around the
dump.
Andrew had just got down

flared.
But under his anger he had
the feeling that it was a waste
of time trying to point things
out to Andrew. Always had
been. Why he continued to
keep the galah on the payroll
was beyond him at times.
Andrew climbed up on the
load to undo the chains. Chis-
lorn walked angrily back to his
office with the nagging sus-
picion that he was losing his
grip. Was he getting too old?
Good Heavens, he’d just turned
60. Fit for another 20 years,
yet. But if things went much
longer like they’d done in the
last month or so he’d be in his
grave before Easter.
He sat down, clattering his
chair on the wooden floor,
smoothed the consignment-
note out with short, stubby
fingers . . . His eyes almost
protruded from his head.

He rattled it furiously, at the

built girl in her early twenties,
with a bit of a reputation to go
with it.
“You wanted someone, Mr.
Chislom?” She had a soft,
personal type of voice, deep
with warmth, and brown eyes
that could be disturbing.
Chislom felt deflated. Out of
the four girls out there it had
to be her. Damn and blast his
luck! Yet it was she who had
entered that fantastic amount
of timber on this consignment-
note. He eyed her coldly, try-
ing to project his anger so that
she would be fully aware of it.
But he had a mounting feeling
that whatever he would say
would go in one ear and out
other. About all the good

wife had requested it. You give
way to your wifes whims in
business and you’re down the
drain. He wished heartily that
he could get rid of her.
Ever since she’d come to the
office there’d been trouble, one
way and another, in the mill.
s b e Q ut j n to the yard
ga i a b s be whistling, with a
consequent slowing-down of
production. And only a week
ago Dunn had knocked another
man out because of something
that had been said about the
giri. And Dunn was like that.
Normally he was an easygoing
so . rt °f a Brute except for one
thing; he thought some of the
log-lorries he drove were
sports-model cars,
“Look, Miss Clarke,” Chis-
lorn said slowly, trying to keep
the sharpness out of his voice,
to be patient with her. “Ten-
thousand super-feet of


sawn timber is thirty tons in
weight!”
“Yes, Mr. Chislom,” she said
eagerly. “So I understand.
Rough mill-calculations is three
tons to the thousand super.”
She looked intelligent
enough; eager enough to
please, with her bright, quick
smile.
“That’s right,” Chislom
agreed. But he revived quickly.
Once you gave way to softness
you were done.
“But where in the name of
Hell, Miss Clarke, are you
going to get a truck to carry
a load like that down the
mountain to the railway?”
“Oh!” she said, looking
worried and perplexed.
“Haven’t we got a truck that
will take that much timber?”
Chislom put his hands down
on the edge of the desk for
something to grip.
“Miss Clark e,” he said
heavily, “if there was a truck
made to carry that sort of a
load down that mountain road
then I’d have it!”
“Oh, I’m sure you would,
Mr. Chislom,” she said bright-
ening. “I’m sorry. I’ll type
out another note. I won’t be
long.”
She took the paper from his
trembling hands with a smile
that was almost motherly, and
was gone in a twinkling of
sheer-nylon stockings on
shapely legs under a green,
wide skirt. Her faint perfume
remained in Chislom’s office.
He blew his nose loudly into
a handkerchief. “God,” he
thought, “if there’s much more
of this I’ll end up in Callan
Park.” He ran a hand over
his forehead slowly. Some-
thing had to be done about the
girl.
But what? If he sacked her
there’d be a confounded hor-
net’s nest at home. What in
the name of suffering tomcats
made aunts believe that their
nieces were cut-out for a career
in the business world? All
that any female ever did around
these parts was to get married
to some blasted mill-hand or
dumb-cluck of a cow-cocky. In
the meantime, from when they
left school and until their fate
caught-up with them, some
confounded fool had to wet-
nurse them because some
blasted aunt or some female
relative wanted a business
executive in the family.
Bah! Look at Candy, his
own daughter, working up at
the cafe. His blood started to
mount again, but he fought
that back. Candy wasn’t to
blame for that altogether. She
said she wasn’t the business
type, but by the same token
she didn’t feel like bludging on
her parents while she was grow-
ing old. Deep down he admired
Candy. But that was his secret.
Tyciss Baxter entered quietly,
placed the tray of made-up
pay-envelopes on his desk, and
went out without a word.
Chislom felt resentment Miss
Baxter was head of the outside
office and should have spotted
that mistake before it got to
him. He felt like calling her
back, but didn’t, because an
idea occurred to him of a
possible way to get rid of the
Clarke girl. An eagerness
swept over him ; he took the
bullock-bell to the window and
clanged it loudly outside.
George Hemmy, the yard
tallyman, stuck his head out
the pokey little office at the
gate and acknowledged Chis-
lom’s summons.
“Tell Joe I want him,” Chis-
lom bellowed above the noise
of the mill, and went back to
his desk.
George, famous for his inter-
pretation of office orders,
"Would you like me to put a fiver for you on the other
guy before it's too late ?”
selected the right Joe from a
half-dozen by that name in the
mill, so that within a few
minutes young Joe Downs was
before Chislom’s desk. Joe
was 18, still at the awkward
age, and as irresponsible as
they come.
Chislom looked him up and
down and wanted to know why
the blazes he wasn’t up in the
bush, where he’d been told to
go instead of hanging round
the mill.
“Baldy can’t find me a
truck.” Joe was immediately
on the defensive.
Chislom’s face darkened.
“Haven’t we got enough trucks
around this mill to keep us in
the poorhouse already?” he
demanded. “Three log-lorries ;
two semi-trailers ; four Land /
Rovers ; two utes! ”
Joe shrugged his shoulders.
“Dunno. I only work here,
and that’s what the foreman
told me.”
“Look! ” Chislom made his
point with a levelled forefinger.
“Tell Mr. Harper the pay’s got
to go up to the Ten Mile camp.
You are to have a vehicle.
Take one of the utes and...”
he paused to add weight to the
rest of his orders. “Take Miss
Clarke with you. She will
handle the pays. She can come
back with Dunn. You bring
the ute back Friday night.”
Joe stood looking at Chislom
with his mouth open. “You
mean for me to drive Winifred
up to the Ten Mile?”
“That’s exactly what I said! ”
Chislom snapped.
“Holy suffering she-cats! ”
Joe whooped, his face lighting
up with pleasure. “Me!”
He shot out of the office like
an exploding fire-cracker.
Chislom relaxed. Much as
he abhorred the irresponsible
immaturity of the present-day-
young, he had a sneaking sus-
picion that Joe would scare the
living daylights out of the
Clarke girl long before they got
to the Ten Mile. If he didn’t,
Dunn would on the way back.
Dunn would have 15-tons of
logs on the Mercedes and be
anxious to get home before
dark. What young Joe would
start on the way up, Dunn
would complete on the way
back. It was teapots to kettles
that when the Clarke female
got back to the mill she’d draw
her pay and head for home
with her tail between her legs.
There’d be nothing his wife
could dredge -up over that
resignation.
Chislom felt relaxed and
pleased with his world.
Toe had a feeling of hopeless-
" ness the closer he got to the
Ten Mile camp. The girl sat at
the far extremity of the seat and
wasn’t to be drawn into talk,
even if they could have talked
above the rattle and roar of
the old battered ute.

APOSTLE-BIRDS
[FROM A SERIES]
Strangers are easily put out of counten-
ance,
and we were strangers in that place;
camped among trees we had no names
for;
not knowing the local customs.
And those big grey birds, how they talked
about us!
They hung head-down from branches and
peered,
they spread their tawny wings like fans
and came so close we could have touched
them,
staring with blunt amusement.
It was ridiculous to feel embarrassed.
Of that camp I remember the large wild
violets, _
the sound of the creek on stones,
the wind-combed grass, the tree-trunks
wrinkled and grey like elephant-legs all
round us —
and those apostle-birds, so rude to
strangers,
so self-possessed and clannish,
we were glad when they went away.

“For this has surely changed
on both sides, and that can be
recognised without any dis-
paragement of the other
Reformation which made us
into a Protestant country or
without any persistence in the

Roman Catholics must be

asserted the principle of toler-
ance of opinion in the public
service. Such objectivity is not

MEMORY-TICKLERS.
Pope has asked his followers
to cast away prejudice. But
tolerance is vastly different
from glossing-over the great
differences between the faiths:
“The Roman Church rightly
champions and jealously
guards its own beliefs. It will
co-operate with other Churches
on matters of common con-
cern. But it will never com-
promise with its doctrine.
There lies its strength.
“The Presbyterian Church of
Scotland showed similar devo-
tion to ideals when it refused
to accept bishops as the price
of closer relations with the
Church of England.
“Anglicans might learn from
these examples to fortify their
own faith.
“The meeting between the
Pope and the Archbishop will
not lessen differences between
the Churches. It will, however,
show the world that ancient
hatreds are forgotten. And
that the leaders of two of the
largest Christian bodies can
discuss problems frankly and
without bitterness.”
As the visit will be the first
of its kind since the Reforma-
tion the “Daily Mail” fears
some people will see it as a
threat to the Reformation. It
dismisses this as “nonsense,”
but feels that from the minds,
characters and words of the
two Christian leaders it is
obvious that “something more
than pleasantries will pass”
between them:
“Dr. Fisher has worked un-
ceasingly for closer under-
standing among all the
Churches. He has written that
‘we must get together and
learn to like to be together
before we can seriously grow
together.’
“Pope John has shown him-
self to be a most human and
open-minded Pontiff. He has
formed a secretariat to foster
the closer unity of all
Christians.
“That such a movement is
of vital importance goes with-
out saying. In Communism
the Christian world faces its
gravest threat since the Otto-
man invasions of Europe in
the 16th and 17th centuries.
“If, without relinquishing in
any way their own doctrines,
the Churches formed a united
front against the forces of
anti-Christ the foundations of
our civilisation would be
greatly strengthened.”
Manchester “ Guardian ”
wishes Dr. Fisher good luck,
but recognises that there may
be misgivings among many
Anglicans and Noncon-
formists who “will find it hard
to see any evidence of friend-
ship on the Roman side.” It
admits that there seems to be
signs of a change at high
levels, but :
“At the same time the
ordinary church member sees
the daily friction and hostility
caused by Roman intolerance
(or, as it can be put, by the
strictness of Catholic belief).
No real friendship can come
while the Roman Church, even
in parish work, treats others
as in outer darkness. Every
time a Catholic wishes to marry
a Protestant there is difficulty.
The marriage must be by
Roman rites, the couple must
undertake that all children will
be brought-up as Catholics:
and there is strong pressure on
the Protestant to become a
Catholic.
No Harmony
This attitude is a
bitter affront to faithful
Christians who are not of the
Roman persuasion. So long
as it lasts there can be no
harmony. Nor, indeed, can
that be attained while priests
of the Roman Church refuse
to pray or preach at others’
services* Here, it is true, some
easing has been felt. Whether
by direction or on their own
initiative a few priests have
sought at least to share in
prayer and preaching: but it
remains exceptional.
“One side does not recog-
nise the other’s ministry as
valid. That is the root of the
trouble. Roman Catholics
believe, or have been taught to
believe, that theirs is the only
true Church. They act accord-
ingly. Anglicans are
indeed put by Rome rather in
the position that they have put
the Presbyterians. Although
the Church of England has
gone far in recent years to-
wards recognition of some
Nonconformist ministry as
valid, it has always stopped
short. The report of the 1958
Lambeth Conference of the
Anglican Communion went so


far as to recognise that the
Anglican Churches ‘ought to
be ready to recognise the Pres-
byterian Churches as true
parts of the one Holy Catholic
and Apostolic Church, and
that the spiritual effectiveness
of their ministerial orders
ought not to be implicitly or
explicitly questioned.’
“But in the next breath it
said that Anglicans could not
conscientiously receive holy
communion from anyone who
had not been ordained by a
bishop. Consequently, although
Anglicans and Presbyterians
now go far in working together
and in respecting each other’s
work, this unreadiness to
approach the Lord’s Table in
full fellowship is, in the words
of a Church of Scotland
report, ‘the greatest stumbling-
block' between the Churches.
More than any other single
cause it interrupted discussion
between them.
“With the Methodists, the
Church of England is nearer
to agreement. But to the
Presbyterians it has given at
least a taste of the treatment
it receives from Rome.
“The only solution —unless
Christendom is to remain weak
and divided —lies in a readi-
ness to recognise as valid
ministries that are parallel with
one another....
“The aim must eventually
be to move towards accept-
ance side by side of different
rites and different forms of
Church government, but with
common beliefs, common
recognition of each other as
good Christians, and a united
testimony.”
Of course nothing will come
of it, says “Time and Tide”—
“except a nail the size of a
crowbar in bigotry’s coffin”:
“Nowadays few people who
hope for Church reunion
expect that this can come by
imposed uniformity: they hope
that if churches and denomina-
tions live truly according to
their own tenets, and love one
another, then unity will grow
in the way that matters. This
involves simple courtesy: a
quality Christians should
possess, but often don't.
Schisms perhaps start from
matters of conscience and prin-
ciple: but they often flourish
on the principles of the show-
manship of all-in wrestling—
‘the Catholic or the Protestant,
the man you love to hate.’
“The signs of all this chang-
ing have been so thick recently
that the hopeful must be
breathless. First there were the
Roman Catholic observers at
the World Council of
Churches ; the other day there
was the Roman Catholic
Bishop of Liverpool’s letter in
the ‘Observer’ saying how
splendid were Anglican and
Nonconformist clergymen ;
now the Archbishop of Canter-
bury is making his own move,
and he has the gratitude of
what must be almost the whole
Church of England.
“There is probably less anti-
Roman bigotry now in Eng-
land than at any time since
Archbishop Arundel. But
what is it that Anglicans still
object to about Romans —
apart from the sort of quali-
ties they object to in them-
selves? It probably boils down
to Papal Infallibility. And the
answer to this is for the Pope
to make an infallible state-
ment that he is fallible. This,
of course, would be meaning-

less ; but it would make every-
one happy who wanted to be
happy,- and it would let the
rest go on arguing about the
meaning of the words until
(as they would themselves put
it) Kingdom Come.”
Polaris Base
Tnformed comment on the
establishment of a nuclear-
submarine depot in Holy
Loch, on the Firth of Clyde,
supports the view of Prime
Minister Macmillan that this
is a risk and a responsibility
which Britain must accept.
Fears have been expressed that
the base would make Glasgow
a primary target in the event
of war. The Edinburgh “Scots-
man” considers this argument
fallacious:
“The English fixed rocket-
bases were indeed open to such
criticism. No one has ever
seriously denied their extreme
vulnerability. Moreover, since
they may for a time have been
the only really effective bases
against Russia from the point
of view of nuclear deterrence,
their presence above ground in
positions easy to wipe out cer-
tainly made surprise attack
more tempting to Russia,
“What makes attack on these
fixed bases attractive is the
possibility of wiping out the
rockets that threaten Russia,
No attack on the Holy Loch,
however, even if combined with
an attack on all other Atlantic
bases, could knock out the
Polaris deterrent. There will
always be submarines at sea
ready to strike Russia if neces-
sary. Since the danger to
Russia will come from all direc-
tions at once, there is no
reason for her to strike at one
point rather than another. Her
only weapons against the
rocket-bearing submarines will
be other submarines attacking
individually in the open sea.
“It is impossible to imagine
an attack on the Holy Loch that
would not occur as part of a
total war situation resulting
in the destruction of everything
worth preserving. The decision
to put a submarine tender in
one place or another can be
evaluated only against this
complete background of terror
and annihilation.
“The objection to servicing
Polaris-bearing submarines on
the Clyde is a radical objection
to the possession of an effec-
tive deterrent by the West.
No one who thinks at all real-
istically can doubt that without
such a deterrent in the present
situation the free nations would
be unable to escanp r

“lt would be foolish to trv
to slur over the amount of C J
cern which in many quarters ‘n
Britain this decision is bouJ
to provoke not least S
those who know nothing and
caie less about the country's
real grave defence needs. Mr
Macmillan himself, who is
acutely sensitive to public
opinion on this and all related
issues, spoke of ‘added
anxieties.’ But it would be
interesting to subject these
anxieties to a cool, relentless,
and totally objective scrutiny’
How far are they rooted in a
dislike of any form of defensive
association with the United
States? How far are they a
manifestation of thinly cloaked
but widespread unilateralism
and pacifism, whose adherents
are always apologising for and
seeking to assist Soviet foreign
and military policy at every
turn?
“To have refused a base for
these missiles and the sub-
marines which carry them
would have been clearly
contrary to the spirit of the
Atlantic alliance and would
have given Britain not one
ounce more power or one ounce
more security. ‘The more we are
involved with the whole com-
plex of the modern deterrent,’
said the Prime Minister, ‘the
more effective our voice be-
comes in the modern world.’
“It will be as impossible to
contract out of a major nuclear
war as it has always proved in
the past impossible for Britain
to abandon her traditional sys-
tem of alliances. The one key
alliance today is Nato. Unity;
within Nato, not squabbling,
suspicion, fear or jealousy, is
the only real, lastingly effective
answer to the vast menace o
our times. If that proposition
is accepted, Britain’s need

and allied nuclear bases within
a 1500-mile periphery of the
Communist bloc ; (b) industrial
and population complexes
within the Detroit-New York-
Pennsylvania triangle of the
U.S. The only way in
which U.S. defence strategists
can reduce the targets in
category (b) is by increas-
ing them in category (a).
The decision to base the
sea-Polaris in Britain, and the
known U.S. plan to base the
land-Polaris on Western
Europe, is therefore a plain
attempt, solely in U.S. national
interests, to increase the nuclear
‘load’ which we will have to
carry. '
“Secondly, the nature of the
weapon itself. The Polaris
now installed in the nuclear
submarine George Washington,
which begins war patrol this
month, is a primitive weapon.
Its margin of error is so great
that it is pointless to zero it
on Soviet nuclear bases: it can
be used only for the indis-
criminate destruction of Soviet
population centres. The 16 H-
bomb warheads carried by the
George Washington are there-
fore designed solely for the
slaughter of tens of millions of
Russians. Britain, as part of
the Polaris system, must there-
fore expect retaliation on a
comparable scale.”
Dragnet Digest
New York “Herald Trityme’:
“Independence and freedom are
not the same thing—a distinc-
tion which the West has got to
get across to the African people,
in their interest no less than in
its own. National independence
can mean only the freedom of
the native strong to oppress,
brutally, the native weak. Free-
dom requires skill and persist-
ence to maintain, and freedom,
not independence, is the key to
human dignity. Democracy is
meaningless where the people
have no understanding of its
workings, dangerous where it
means rule by demagogue.
“Impatient Africans ma y
never be persuaded, but their
best friends are often those
European Governments which'
insist on holding power until a
native leadership emerges
which is both competent and
responsible—which will use
independence to guarantee free-
dom, not to destroy it.”
* * *
Manchester “G u a r d i a n”:
“Like Berlin, the disarmament
question can only be settled by
mutual compromise. No dis-
armament plan has any chance
of being accepted unless it is
careful not to give a military
advantage to either side at any
stage in the plan. Thus, any
plan which demands the aban-
doning of foreign bases at an
early stage is bound to be
rejected, for that would give a
military advantage to the Soviet
Union. But the corollary is
that a plan which imposes
strict control and inspection at
an early stage is also likely to
be rejected, since secrecy is one
of the greatest military advan-
tages at present enjoyed by the
Soviet Union.
“Yet the West cannot accept
a disarmament plan which fails
to include stringent control, for
that would entail trusting the
Soviet Union farther than its
record deserves. For all these
reasons general and complete
disarmament is likely to be un-
acceptable next year, as it has
been this.
“The best answer, then, is to
look for limited disarmament
schemes either limited geo-
graphically or in terms of the
weapons disarmed. The control
of outer space is one possibi-
lity ; for here neither side as
yet has a military advantage to
lose. Another possibility is a
limited disarmament scheme in
Central Europe, where neither
side has vital interests at stake.
But that, again, may entail
settling the Berlin problem.”
* * *
David Ormsby-Gore (British
representative at U.N.): “I can-
not emphasise too strongly or
too often that whatever stage
of nuclear disarmament we
might have reached short of
eliminating the means of
making war altogether, should
war break out again it would
be a nuclear war within at most
a year.”

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Spring Round Finale
The Eclipse Stakes —last of
the big spring handicaps —
went to yet another New
Zealand-bred horse, though the
prizemoney stays in Victoria.
The winner, Savage, was
bought in N.Z. earlier this year
by Victorian trainer Theo
Lewis for 2000gns., and the
six-year-old Ruthless-Happy
Climax gelding, now raced by
C. O. Jennings, has proved a
bargain. Saturday’s win was
his third on end, with fore-
runner victories in the Werri-
bee and Bendigo Cups.
There was an exciting finish
to the Eclipse. At the furlong-
post Well Spent, who had led
throughout, was still well clear,
but Jack Purtell could obvi-
ously feel his mount weaken-
ing, and he rode desperately
to raise another effort. Well
Spent responded gamely, but
Bill Williamson brought Savage
along with a nicely-timed run
that gained the verdict in a
photo-finish, with Gabonia,
surprisingly favorite, third.
For the second week in suc-
cession Bill Williamson rode
a treble, and that despite a
heavy fall from Lady D’Argent
in the first heat of the Ormond
Trial, opening race on the card.
Both Williamson and Lake
came down in the Trial, one
of the roughest races seen at
Caulfield for many a day. The
Ormond was a special-weights
event for three-year-olds and
upwards who had not won a
flat-race worth £3OO to the
winner. Such conditions
suited three-year-olds that had
been running well in class com-
pany without winning. Both
Royal Descent and Campo,
the heat winners, had been
third at their previous starts
during the Melbourne Cup
meeting—Royal Descent to
Cruiser and Wire Service in
the Batman Stakes, and Campo
to Smogol and Decade in the
Carnival Handicap. Royal
Descent is a grey colt by
Prince Ki (imp.) from Kitbag,
and Campo a black colt by
Landau (imp.) from Savannah.
If it is not quite a road to
riches, betting on form two-
year-olds is as safe a line of
speculation as the racecourse
offers. Neither his heavy
weight (9.6) nor wide barrier
(18) troubled the consistent
grey gelding Valala, who
easily won the first division of
the Stansmore Two-year-old.
From five starts, Valala has
won three times, and run a
second and a third.
Second Stansmore winner
Royal Meadow has also been
consistent, with two wins and
two seconds from four starts.
Like Valala, Royal Meadow
was bred by Sir Chester Mani-
fold, chairman of the V.R.C.,
at his Talindert property near
Camperdown (Vic.). Valala
and Royal Meadow were got
by Meadow Mist. Royal Mea-
dow is from Lulan, who has
proved a great brood mare.
Others of her progeny, Rhexia,
Camperdown and Bright Lu,
have performed well.
The huge Landau-La Patrice
horse Anonyme is one of the
best sprinters bred in Victoria
in recent years, but he’s not
good at the barrier and because
of his size he’s awkward in a
field —faults which have cost
him many races he should have
won. Even so, punters showed
their respect by accepting
evens about him in the mile
Senior Welter, despite his 10.2
burden. Cleanly away, he had
only a romp to win by three
lengths, and complete Bill
Williamson’s treble (the other
winning mounts were Valala
and Savage). A four-year-old,
Anonyme has plenty of racing
ahead of him, and he will win
some rich stakes before he goes
to the stud.
Most of Royal Crown’s best
races have been run down
Flemington’s straight-six—he
has shown a tendency to hang-
out around turns, and in fact
was sent to Sydney at one
stage with the thought that he
would gallop more kindly the
reverse way. He hung-out just
as badly in Sydney, but trainer
Phil Burke has apparently
cured him at last. At Caul-
field Royal Crown was backed
in a real old-fashioned plunge
(sixes to 5/2) to win the six-
furlongs Rosstown Plate. He
landed the money, but only
narrowly after Jack Purtell had
got the last ounce from him
in a desperate finish.
There might be a very
bright future ahead of the
three-year-old chestnut gelding
Havelock, who scored his third
win in a row against his own
age in the six-furlongs Pelham
Handicap. In a pretty good
field Havelock swamped his
opponents in the run home to
score very easily. It was all
to Havelock’s credit that he
came back to six furlongs after
winning twice at a mile. He
is New Zealand-bred, by
Targui (imp.) from the stoutly-
bred Vixenish, and was bought
by W. R. Kemball, who
invests heavily at
yearling- S aie S each c he

Feul/i In the
Future
m
\
*
Australia’s growing achievement is recorded in
figpres covering every phase of the national story.
In the past June year, for instance, the gross
national product rose by eight per cent, above that
of 1958-59, to reach a figure of more than
six-and-three-quarter thousand million pounds.
But perhaps it is brought more directly home
by looking at the development now taking place
around us. We see and feel it.
The economy is buoyant. New natural
resources are being woven into production—and
their exploration is still under way. Industrial
output is expandirig in range and volume. In
supplement to internal investment, there is a strong
flow of private capital from abroad.
Through natural increase and migration we
are growing in human strength, and can look to
the future confident in the knowledge that our
country will go on prospering so long as we continue
to give it our best in energy and initiative.
It is necessary to re-state this belief because
there is sometimes a tendency to regard the future
with apprehension.
True, the world is beset with problems. It
always has been. And the winners all down the
ages have been those who, like our forefathers
here in Australia, looked past the near mists and
were determined with clear minds to solve
their difficulties.
We could list many incidental problems within
our vision right now: such questions as the
controlling of inflationary trends, the relation
between efficiency and costs, the need for getting
a broader national balance through the spreading
of population, the provision of better roads, and a
fuller use of mechanisation.
All these requirements, and more, will have to
be met in carrying through one of the biggest
undertakings given to men in our time —the
development of a whole continent.
The challenge is big. but the prize is Australia.
And the extent to which we can take the bounty
of these years on and out into the future depends
on how selflessly we now give ourselves over to
the task.

Other Sports
As the West Indians come
east their reputation increases.
On Friday what, 10 years ago,
was a famous combination of
spin-bowlers showed afresh,
by wrecking the Victorian
innings, that it is still a major
cricket-force. On Saturday,
with “champion” Sobers in the
pavilion, Kanhai (to the tune
of a record 252), Hunte and
Worrell humbled the Victorian
attack, including Australia’s
“demon,” Meckiff.
After the first two days of
this match only Kline, of the
Victorians, had made a note-
worthy effort. This fact has
some significance for the Test
series. Against speed the
visitors seem at home ; against
Benaud, and a suitable partner
for Benaud —which choice will
be the Aussie selectors’ major
problem—it may be a different
story.
On the batting side, it
cannot be expected, despite
Simpson’s failure in Perth and
McDonald’s in Victoria, that
the ’lndies will run through
the Australian batting for small
totals. Most consistent of the
visitors’ batsmen will probably
be Worrell, when the pressure
is really on. But the fact
remains that these most enter-
taining cricketers are playing
themselves into better and
better form, and are about to
issue a serious challenge to
Australian cricket supremacy.
* * *
In a game in which only 13
balls were bowled on the first
day and none at all on the
second (J. Pluvius himself de-
ciding to bat for most of those
two days), the West Indies and
S.A. played a draw, though
two closures by S.A. skipper
Favell gave the West Indies a
slight chance to force a win.
Set 181 to get in a little over two
hours, the visitors were only 32
short at stumps. S.A., 9-279,
3-44 ; Wgst Indies, 143, 3-149.
Two hard-hitting batsmen,
Favell (71) and Dansie (106)
put on 132 for the third wicket.
Neil Hawke, who has been in
Perth for the last couple of
years, and has repped for that
State at both cricket and foot-
ball, made 40. For the visitors,
Kanhai, Hunte and Alexander
batted brightly in the second-
innings.
* * *
What an extraordinary de-
cision Benaud made when he
batted again in the N.S.W.-
Queensland Shield match, a de-
cision which, he said, aimed at
brighter cricket. No one is a
brighter cricketer than Benaud
himself, as his first innings
knock in this very match testi-
fied, and it is to see more
players like him that the public
will pay, whether one side is
unmercifully thrashed or not.
If, in any game of cricket,
there is a chance for one side to
snatch an outright victory by
conceding the possibility of a
defeat to an enterprising batting
side that is all very well; but
in this case Benaud merely
made his team’s chances of out-
right victory more difficult. If
the move were to have been suc-
cessful from his point of view,
would Queensland have had to
win the match? Carried to ex-
tremes, Benaud’s ideas for
brighter cricket would result
in “time” matches ; but it is
not the game itself which needs
brightening, it is the playing
of it.
As it turned out, Benaud and
Martin bundled the Queensland
men out in time and won by
162 runs. And whether or not
that means that the N.S„W.
second innings was “justified,”
it was a good win, only slightly
less good because of O’Neill’s
failure.
The N. S. Wales team for the
match against the West Indies,
which starts in Sydney on
November 25, has not been
changed. Unless Rorke makes
a good showing in this match
he could well be out of big
cricket for good, for the Aus-
t'alian team for th, « ; „

make the steering better —un-
less someone were coming up.
And it was peanuts to popcorn
there'd be no one coming up.
Farther down again, about
200yds. farther down, there was
a sharp bend to the right with
a sheer drop of 200 ft. into a
gully hidden in trees on the
outside curve.
Darkey would use a lot of
brake here, hugging the inside
curve, going right out until he
could straighten-up and hurtle
on down the grade into the
gully and up the other side.
Joe aimed at shooting past
Darkey on that next uphill
grade; using the horn and
stepping on the gas in second ;
and poke muck at Darkey
about his careful driving next
time they got together.
A s expected Darkey checked
with his brakes a little on
the first bend. Joe felt his con-
fidence rise. He had Darkey's
measure now. He felt the hot
blood sweeping up into his
face. Man, this was living;
this was driving with the wild
free feeling of the utility in
neutral and the sharp, sudden
decrease in speed as you stood
on the brakes, your wits
matched against those of the
man in front who didn't even
know you were on the road
behind him.
He eased-up on the brakes
a little, eyes glued on the
bobbing, swaying flag ahead.
The flag came in over the
bonnet of the ute, dangled and
jerked across the windscreen as
he checked the forward surge
of speed with the brakes, hold-
ing the dirty red flag now on
the glass in front of him.
“Now, what d'you say about
that, eh?” he yelled excitedly
to the girl. “You ever seen a
windscreen cleaned like this
before, eh?”
“No,” she said, and it
sounded as if she were bored
stiff. “But then, of course,
there has to be a first time
with everything, hasn’t there?”
Joe felt deflated. You
wouldn’t impress this piece if
you bashed her head against a
brick wall, even. Unreasonable
anger surged over him and he
reached for the ignition switch.
He’d bash the damned ute into
gear and whip past Darkey.
That’d make her hair stand up
on end from the roots, passing
Darkey as they went into the
next bend.
But Darkey was too far over
on his right, hugging the sheer
face of the cliff. Joe cursed
silently, on edge, ready to take
the first opening he could see.
Then, suddenly there was no
red flag dangling in front of
his windscreen.
He blinked sharply. There
was no truck either ; only the
gravel, downhill sweep of the
road opening up in front of
him as he fought the ute round
the bend. He brought the ute
"I've just told him the bear facts of life.”
to a stop with a cold, gripeing
fear beginning to claw at the
pit of his stomach, praying to
God that he didn’t begin a skid
in the loose, coarse gravel.
They ran back up the road,
peered over. A cloud of dust
hung over the tree-tops far
below, and even as they looked,
smoke came up from out of the
trees where the dust lay like a
pail. A silence that could
almost be felt hung over the
world until, sharp and ciear,
a broken branch snapped with
a report like a rifle.
“Hell!” Joe said, shocked.
“He went over.”
His face was white and
drawn-together, and then he
was sick.
When that was over he felt
weak and unnerved.
Win said sharply: “Now I
know just how much guts
you’ve got. There isn’t any-
thing we can do here. Let’s
get up to the camp and bring
some men back here. I'll drive.
By the look of you you
wouldn’t be able to drive a
pram.”
Che drove fast, but she drove
well, kicking the ute into
the gravelled bends on the
brakes, pulling out in a lower
gear with a hard foot on the
accelerator. Once she said
sharply, “I suppose he was
driving in neutral, like you
were.” Then, with a touch of
wonder in her voice: “How
silly can we get? Let’s not say
anything about gears. Insur-
ance —his wife and kids.”
She glanced at Joe briefly,
and all that he could do was
nod agreement. He didn’t give
a damn what anyone would
think about Darkey’s accident.
He hadn’t caused it. Darkey
wouldn’t have known he was
behind him, anyway. The
trouble was, Darkey was going
too fast for the bend. That
was it, too fast for the bend.
But he hoped Win’d keep her
promise and not say anything
about how close he’d been to
Darkey’s tail. The cops might
take a dim view of it. He’d
been warned a couple of times
already about speeding.
The Ten Mile camp lay off
the road a bit in a cool, wide
gully fringed with secondary
timber. Dunn’s big truck,
loaded with mill-logs, waited
on the track. Dunn came out
of one of the huts with three
other men, and Win brought
the ute to a fierce
hard brakes. s °P with

going round the bend, the next
it was gone.”
Dunn and the men left J
mediately. “We’ll do what we.
can," Dunn said soberly. “In
the meantime, Win, ring the
old man and tell him what
happened. Tell him to send an
ambulance.” ' He turned back
to her. “Also tell him that
you’ll be late back and to let
your mother know.”
"It will be dark,” she said
quickly, glancing past him at)
the waiting truck with its load*
of logs.
“That’s all right,” he said
reassuringly. “You’ll be as safe
in that as anything else on the
road.”
“Yes,” she said, watching the
men climb into a Land/Rover
and drive off with the slow dust
rising behind them lazily. ,
C|he hoped that that young

the same script with scheduled
drugs, without the inclusion
automatically stopping payment
to the chemist.
One is happy to be able to
note that very many new
additions to the schedule have
at last given the practitioner a
list from which there is prac-
tically no need whatsoever to
depart. This, together with
numerous other concessions to
busy medicos, is certainly going
to make life easier for us all —
doctor, patient and chemist.
"This is an audience-participation show. Care to join in?”
Probably the one to benefit
most will be the pensioner—
invalid or age—who up to
October 31 frequently had to
dip into his slender income for
some preparation not included
in the schedule. This will now
be most unlikely.
Doctors generally feel that
the health-scheme as envisaged
in this country is superior to
any other now operating. How-
ever, there has to date been a
large hiatus between vision and
actuality. It is now felt that
that gap has at last been
bridged and that we can con-
fidently extol our health-scheme
as this planet’s finest. Long
may it flourish. — Medic (Q.).
South Africa and the Com-
, ,
monwealtn
The result of the South
African referendum poses a
delicate problem for all mem-
bers of the British Common-
wealth. A few, sensitive to
apartheid, have been dropping
hints of expulsion. But nobody
really knows how this would
be done. The British Com-
monwealth of Nations has no
Constitution, no set of rules of
procedure to govern such
matters, and for the very good
reason that it is not so much
an organisation as an organism.
It wasn’t planned and con-
structed ; it just grew—its form
and extent are indefinite. It
can, without serious harm,
occasionally cast-off one of its
members (for instance, Burma),
and such a piece may either be
eaten by scavengers or grow
into a new individual; but per-
haps it is better to compare it
to a species in process of evolu-
tion rather than an individual,
for nobody can forecast what
form its future growth will take.
But as to South Africa, it is
only by courtesy that it can be
called a democracy. Its
Government represents, not
the whole people or even the
majority, but a majority
(Nationalist) of a majority
(European) of a minority (non-
Negro). The European opposi-
tion, represented in the main
by the United party (another
courtesy-title), are the only
others enjoying real civil rights,
and they fear that these will, in
time, be lost to most of them.
In fact, some of them claim
that they are already second-
class citizens; that in the civil
service, for example, they have
no hope of promotion.
They also claim to see signs
of a coming purge in the
Nationalist party. That is only
to be expected ; the concentra-
tion of power in the hands of
a minority is apt to gain
momentum once it starts, and
is very hard to reverse. It can
only be tackled with any hope
of success from inside the
country, and at present there
is no sign of unity of purpose
among the Government’s
opponents. Each class in the
political order of precedence
would prefer as rulers the class
above them to any class below
them. Even many of the
Negroes are apparently not
anxious to see power pass to
their own extremists.
It is important to keep in
mind that civil - war never
broadens the basis of power, it
merely exchanges one tyrant
for another. Cromwell, Robes-
pierre and Castro soon proved
even more despotic than the
despots they replaced. And a
civil-war in South Africa could
have disastrous consequences
for the whole of Africa, indeed
for the whole world.
All in all, the best policy for
the present would appear to be
one of masterly inactivity in
public, with a behind-the-scenes
damping - down of passions.
There are signs that even
Ghana and Malaya are coming
round to this view. If South
Africa proves to be thoroughly
incompatible with the Com-
monwealth she will be cast-off
by the inexorable process of
growth. But while she remains
within it there will be oppor-
tunity for her well - wishers
everywhere to encourage the
more liberal elements and to
foster an enlightened and united
public-opinion in favor of
widening the spread of rights
and responsibilities, to which
even the backblocks dictators
of the Nationalists, the Broeder-
bond and the Dutch Reformed
Church must eventually bow.
—Magnoon (Q.).
Diet and Disease
As a one-time vegetarian,
I’ve been drinking-in all the
comment and criticism con-
cerning the Murray Rose diet
(B. 9/11/ ’6O, etc.). My own
experience was that so long as
I avoided meat I enjoyed good
health. The same was the
experience of a host of others,
including George Bernard
Shaw and Annie Besant who
were strict vegetarians and yet


contrived to live well beyond
the allotted span, enjoy robust
health and accomplish a great
deal more during their long
lives than the average meat-
eater.
Then there has been the evi-
dence of dentists, many of
whom have assured me that
vegetarian patients seemed less
prone to dental-decay. This
comparative immunity could,
however, be attributed more to
eating whole-wheat bread than
abstinence from meat. Some
I’ve known to flourish on a
non-meat diet: on the other
hand, I have known vegetarians
to be pallid, thin, listless and
subject to digestive complaints
But, whatever may be the
merits of vegetarianism, from
my own observations I can only
conclude that too many of its
adherents (especially those who
make raw vegetables their
staple article of diet), sooner or
later suffer from kidney-stones.
European friends of mine,
discussing the subject, relate
the experiences of some of their
friends in a clinic-cwm-rest-
home which used to be run by
a fashionable doctor in Switzer-
land. All his success depended
on the raw-vegetable and fruit-
juice diet he handed-out to the
patients For years his cures
were accepted as “spectacular” ;
later, he was forced to shut-up
shop because too many of his
former patients had subse-
quently developed kidney-
stones.
I’ve neyer yet heard of a
doctor who admits that a raw-
"I'm afraid, Sligg, I can't see eye-to-eye with you!"
vegetable diet can be respon-
sible for the complaint. Yet,
surely, the occurrence of the
disease among vegetarians (or
former ones) is so frequent
that it is unlikely to be sheer
coincidence. It would be help-
ful and interesting to have some
opinions on the subject by one
or more of those medicine-men
who, from time to time, con-
tribute so ably to this page.—
Maitri (N.S.W.).
L.-g. Finances
Too often when local-govern-
ment finances are being dis-
cussed the high cost of admini-
stration is overlooked. Most
municipal- and shire-councils
have become strongholds of
bureaucracy and are in fact
run by the salaried officers, who
tell the aldermen or council-
lors what has to be done.
Naturally, these local bureau-
crats like to have a cosy little
set-up behind them to avoid
doing too much work them-
selves. It follows, then, that
every head of a council-depart-
ment has a deputy, a couple
of assistants and other helpers.
Thus the deadwood piles-up.
The outside staff naturally tend
to get out of as much work as
they can.
In my own district some of

“Business is Business. An old

would wish °thern °to do "to" you'
We refer, of course, to those people

Pharmacy channels such as chain-

they fully expect. him to be avaU-’

< Tbe cbem ist serves you in sick-

I agree entirely with the
exhortation, but, adopting the
axiom quoted, the chemist

obligations, and in many
instances doesn’t observe them,

“Just like us —come all this Way to a rain-dance and forget the umbrellas !”
New Recordings
Giving Ballads a Burl
It is usually not easy to name
the originators of folk-songs,
but Decca, in putting out a
batch of 14 sung by the old
maestro Burl Ives to the ac-
companiment of his guitar, has
found no difficulty. The songs
are described as “written and
composed by Burl Ives.” It’s
a little puzzling. One would
have thought, for example, that
“How Could You Use a Poor
Maiden So?” antedated Burl
both as to words and tune.
“Willie Boy” seems closely re-
lated to “Billy Boy” and
“Turkish Revery” rather like
“The Golden Vanitee,” trans-
mogrified in words and music.
In a personal note on the
sleeve Burl calls all his offer-
ings folk-songs, but the disk
is titled Ballads With Guitar
(HAA7SBI). It’s a collection
in the easy, pleasant vein that
made Ives such a popular enter-
tainer on his Australian tour.
There’s the ballad “Henry
Martin” —a conscientious Scot
who became a pirate “upon the
salt sea, for to maintain his
two brothers and he.” There’s
“Lily Munro” —her true love
went off to war, so “she
dressed herself in man’s array
and to the War Department she
marched off straight away.”
Other lilting songs tell of
pirates, milkmaids and such.
But the “Irish Rover” is a
ship, not a man. It sails from
Cork, bound for New York,
with almost the entoire popula-
tion of Ould Oireland aboard
and most of the counthry’s
produce, too. Does it get
there? Well, Burl does, but
apparently he’s the only sur-
vivor. One for the road: “The
Hypochondriac,” with half a
dozen twangs on the guitar and
two lines of song, must be the
shortest ballad ever. Running-
time : 26 seconds!
The Strauss Beat
Vienna and the Waltz form
as inseparable an institution as
do Herbert von Karajan and
the Vienna Philarmonic Orch-
estra, and in R.C.A.’s The
Vienna of Johann Strauss
(L 16259) the four come into
brilliant conjunction. This
orchestra is the proud
guardian of the city’s musical
traditions. No other major
orchestra seems quite able to
attain, in delineations of the
Strauss waltzes, the same
mellow tone, delicate phrasing,
feeling for style and, above all,
impeccable taste ; and the con-
ductor certainly adduces here
plenty of support for that belief.
There are the Overtures to
“Die Fledermaus” and “Gipsy
Baron,” both representative of
the Waltz King in his most re-
fulgent period; two graceful
polkas—“Annen” and “Auf der
Jagd” ; and the much-admired
“Tales from the Vienna
Woods.” Josef Strauss fills in
the odd spot with his “De-
lirien Waltz” and therein gives
notice that at least in this
sample of his art he could hold
his own with his more famous
brother.

Lakeside Ballet
It needs only for someone to
mention “Swan Lake” and
some recordists will at the drop
of a hat rush in and commit
it to the waxen tracks, irre-
spective ; and some platters
that have hit the market have
been tasteless confections in
which a few of the more
obvious snippets have been
pressed into service. But
Decca’s Highlights from Swan
Lake (LXTA 5581) is something
really out of the box. Where-
as most recordings concentrate
on the gem-studded second Act,
here Ernest Ansermet and the
Suisse Romande Orchestra, in
13 episodes, cover almost all
of the most important sections
of the score, which rather
makes “highlights” sound too
modest. The performance is
marked by superb technical
precision and luscious tone.

Melachrino Strings
“Bells Are Ringing,” the
musical that clocked over 900
performances on Broadway,
hasn’t been seen in Australia
as a stage show, but the film
version, with Judy Holliday
playing her original role of the
telephone-girl who gets her
lines crossed, is now going the
rounds. With good timing
R.C.A. has released a George
Melachrino interpretation of
Music from “Bells are Ringing”
(L 10942). Jule Styne, who was
a Hollywood songwriter befon
he tried his luck on Broadway
turned-in a tuneful batch o.
numbers for this show, and th<
Melachrino orchestra has pir
the best of them on this disk
including the popular hits "Jus
in Time,” and “The Farm,'

To further co-operation in mis-
sionary work, a World Conference
on Christian Missions was held at
Edinburgh in 1910, and this was
followed in 1921 by the establish-
ment of the International Missionary
Council. This council held con-
ferences at Jerusalem, in 1928, and
at Tambaran (Madras) in 1938-39.
The Faith and Order Movement,
which studies the differences of
belief and practice separating
Christian Churches, and which was
founded by Charles Brent, Bishop
of the Protestant Episcopal Church
of the U.S.A. in the Philippines,
held conferences at Lausanne in
1927, and at Edinburgh in 1937.
Another movement, known as the
Life and Work Movement, which
promoted common Christian study
and action with regard to the social,
political and economic problems of
the time, was founded largely under
the leadership of Nathan Soder-
blom, Archbishop of Uppsala.
World conferences were held in
1925 at Stockholm, and in 1937 at
Oxford.
A provisional committee to pre-
pare the setting-up of a World
Council was appointed at Utrecht
on May 13, 1938, under the chair-
manship of William Temple, then
Archbishop of York.
The original conference at
Amsterdam appointed a central
committee of 90 members with
power to appoint its own executive
and six presidents. The second
assembly, which was held at Evans-
ton (U.S.A.) in August, 1954, with
delegates from 163 member
churches, appointed a new central
committee and six new presidents.

been used as early as 1863, when
Monet exhibited a sunset named
“Impressions” af the Salon des
Refuses, the painting coming in
for a good deal of ridicule.
“Impressionist” painters had been
at work as early as 1855, when
Courbet exhibited paintings which,

SPORTSMEN OF THE SNOWY—AND
SPRING
Winter had passed behind us, or so the
poster read ;
We were having a Spring Carnival —
Sports, the wording said.
A mob of wild eyed Irishmen were to
show us how to play
Hurling, and Gaelic football, just to
pass the time away.
The field didn’t look too bad, and it
didn’t look too hot;
Holes were quickly filled up, blue metal
was the shot.
Roots and stumps—sorta made it a
little rough,
But they’d be just the shot to sit on,
if things got really tough.
Though we came from every country,
only the Irish knew the rules,
And the game had hardly started when
we called them “flaming fools.”
For they bashed and wacked all over,
up and down the ground,
And they didn’t seem to mind it if
there weren’t a ball around.
Misguided balls and bodies intruded
our drinking spree,
“Orangemen” they were branded, for
this gross impertancy.
Evasiveness was needed, to go home
fully sound,
The remark was made quite heatedly—•
“It ain’t the Cricket Ground.”


Women’s Letters
CONSUMERS ANONYMOUS
When you read about “the consumer”
in the newspapers, hear politicians toss-
ing the word about, or listen to econo-
mists talking about consumers and pro-
ducers, do you realise that they are really
talking about women?
“Consumer” is a code word which en-
ables men to get messages across to one
another without arousing suspicion.
Until now!
When they say “The increase in price
will be passed on to the consumer,” they
really mean it will be passed on to the
women.
“The consumer will suffer,” decoded,
means “Women will suffer.” But they
are too frightened to come out in the
open and say just that.
They speak of “consumer demands.”
Being men they cannot quite admit that
what they are talking about are “women’s
demands.”
As for “Consumers are up in arms”—
that is just a secret way of saying “women
are up in arms.” But it’s not so likely to
cause a panic.
Yet women are the consumers in this
world. . Not in the sense of fdmale
spiders eating up their mates, or female
grasshoppers devouring everything in
sight (that’s teenagers) or even the sad-
and-stout not being able to keep off the
chocolate mousse, but in the sense that
women buy 80 per cent of retail goods.
They buy traymobiles and hair-nets,
books and pretzel-holders, sofas, garden-
goblins, houses, cars and apples-on-a-
stick.
Even when a man buys something
strictly masculine like a block-and-tackle
or a brace-and-bit, it is probably be-
cause he wants to make something for
his ball-and-chain.
It may be that men are not naturally
enterprising. Women are the fussers. A
man is quite happy to mosey along
through life, expending just enough
energy to supply his primary needs and
then, physically content, to put his feet up
and relax.
It is hard to get him out to a dance,
or a show. Even when he’s watching
television he goes to sleep!
The cave-man brought home the food.
The woman had to cook it. It was her
fumbling attempts to construct some sort
of pot to cook it in that started him out in
this industry—and in the invention of
civilisation, producing Benvenuto Cellini
and the electric frypan en route, until he
consummated the process in the bar-
becue.
In art it was probably the women’s
attempts to pretty-up the cave that gave
rise to the primitive drawings that modern
man has recently been getting his artistic
inspiration from.
For all of these reasons, this new
column will be devoted each week to the
activities of woman as a consumer.

A.G.M/s in Bloom
Just preceding the season of goodwill,
there occurs the season of Annual
General Meetings. Really a second
flowering (for a few bloom in the
autumn) this season of A.G.M.’s con-
cludes the year neatly and leaves sub-
scribers, wellwishers, members and bene-
factors free to take-off for Christmas
with a sense of a year’s work well done.
Annual General Meetings are all
ceremonious and most are very polite.
There is a chairman who makes gentle
little jokes, and a secretary who reads
the minutes, always mentioning (under
“apologies”) those who were not there
at the previous A.G.M. and seldom those
who were. There is a report that is
explained and a deficit that is explained
away. If there is no deficit and the
organisation is run by women, it is always
pointed out that this is because it is
run by women and that it is a pity they
are not running the country.
Then there is a guest-speaker (except
at the A.G.M. of the War Widows Guild
which always has about 20 guest-
speakers), a committee which comes up
for re-election and is re-elected, “there
being no other nominal

Lovely shimmering Thai-silks, raw-
silk from Bangkok, printed cottons from
Singapore and saris from India were used
to make the attractive suits, frocks and
cocktail-dresses shown by young designer
Sue Green. This fashion-parade, arranged
by the Kurneh Auxiliary to the Queen
Victoria Hospital, was set at the South
Yarra home of Mr. Reg Riddell. Out-
standing was a brown satin frock with
the bodice entirely appliqued with lace
and heavily encrusted with opalescent-
beads. A Ming-blue, gold-spotted sari
featured a wide gold-bordered portrait-
neckline and also had gold tassels.
Eye-catching was an ice-blue satin sheath-
frock with a scattered design in opalescent
beads. A black silk frock, of Philippines-
design, carried silver flowers on the full
skirt and bodice. An attractive ballerina
frock in oyster-grey satin was enhanced
by hand-painted brown and grey flowers.
The President of the Q.V. Hospital
auxiliaries, Mrs. Arthur Wenzel,, opened
the parade, at the conclusion of which
champagne and petit fours were served.
Mrs. Wenzel’s printed-silk suit was in
blue, green, grey and white, her moss-
green straw cloche was wreathed with
pale-green roses. The ticket-secretaries
were Mrs. Percy Northrop, who wore a
white silk frock patterned with Wedg-
wood-blue roses and green leaves, and
Mrs. Louis Green, who contrasted her
royal-blue silk-tweed suit with a floral-
silk blouse. Among the 150 guests were
Margaret Ann Jupp, Ann Tinklepaugh
(who came from New York to marry
Colin Jupp on December 9), Mrs. R.

the year the group raised £3774 towards
the Centre Fund, and at the meeting
Lady Casey received a cheque for a
further £943. A pleasant little ceremony
at the conclusion of the meeting was the
cutting of a cake, bearing 13 candles, by
committee-member Mrs. Robert Sauve,

Walkabout Novels
The atmosphere of a conducted tour
which surrounds so much Australian
art and letters is not dissipated by two
new novels, The Irishman, by Eliza-
beth O’Conner (Angus and Robertson),
and The Exiles, by Lynn Foster
(Hodder and Stoughton), but it is less
noticeable in “The Irishman” than in
“The Exiles.”
Miss Foster is herself an exiled
Sydney scriptwriter, and her book is a
version of a series of TV plays she
wrote for the 8.8. C. It inherits the
quick scene-changes, cameos and flash-
backs dear to radio and TV producers,
and much of the mystifactory method
that keeps audiences tuning-in next
week.
Why is the devoted young painter’s
virtuous and beautiful young mother
typing series of articles for newspapers
in their squalid flat in a subdivided old
house in a Sydney slum? This is be-
cause her mother and father were
pioneer squatters, which brings in
farming and droughts. One son had
been meeting the other son’s wife at
night, but the injured son imagined
that his wife had really been meeting
a wild Irish blackbirder. To keep
the family together the sister said it
was she who had been meeting the wild
Irishman, which was partly true.. She
left home in disgrace, married a fine
man who was killed in World War I
and so became a writer of newspaper
articles.
All this is disclosed gradually
through the young painter realising
that a prominent member of the
Federal Parliament is one of his rela-
tives, meeting a young cousin when
he is spruiking at Sydney Show, to
whom he loses the nice girl with whom
he surfed at Bondi, and meeting
Grandma, who dies in a Darlinghurst
hospital. Taking these present-day
scenes in with flashbacks of pioneering
life in the outback, Miss Foster
manages to travel a set. of standard
characters from English and American
novels through a representative selec-
tion of Australian life and history.
Miss O’Conner’s “The Irishman” is
not picaresque in this tourist-class
manner. If her book seems to point-up
the Australian scene it is because, as
one would expect of the author of the
Gulf-country best-seller, “Steak for
Breakfast,” the outback, and especially
the North Australian outback, has been
her life.
Her Irishman is a blackhearted
horse-drover in an old Queensland
mining town, meeting competition
from trucks. His older son, sacked
from a cattle-station for getting a young
gin into trouble, takes-out the girl’s
death on his old man by becoming a
truck-driver. Father and son fight and,
having half-killed his son. the Irishman
leaves home for the last time to sell his
horses on the coast.
The younger son then takes a job
with a squatter who has driven his wife
mad by bringing home a half-caste
mistress. He accompanies the squatter
on a night-raid in which a neighbor is
repaid for stealing calves by having
part of his herd driven into a secret
valley and later shot. The lad goes
droving to the coast, comes back to
be crippled for life after trying to ride
a wild horse, and later goes on another
trek from station to station seeking his
father.
Although the main interest of the
book is in these peregrinations and the
people caught in their net, the people
are by no means stock characters. The
happy squatter with the amused eyes
and the nice wife, the tough squatter
with the mad wife and the half-caste
mistress, here and there a station-hand,
a nurse at an outback hospital
guardedly telling a young stockrider
that his black-gin mistress is dead, an
ex-convict racehorse trainer, are all
sketched with truth, if not force. And
the Irish family are by no means stage-
Irish: the humor of the grandfather and
grandmother, the dreadful anger of the
father, the pathetic desolation of the
mother, and the portraits of the two
sons, the x one hating his father, the
other in despair over losing him, fit
naturally into a scene which the reader
is pleased to have visited if only
because it seems to have been really
there.
Exploring the Explorers
Voyager Poems (Jacaranda), chosen
by Douglas Stewart and published in a
pleasant format as an “Australian
University Paperback” consists of six
long poems exploring the explorers.
In the opening poem, “Five Visions
of Captain Cook,” Slessor has fused his
romantic and realistic elements into a
brilliant unity tossing off picturesque
images and resounding phrases. In
contrast to such colorfulness Fitz-
Gerald’s “Heemskerck Shoals” comes
almost austerely, although Tasman on
occasion can recall
a desperate chance —
like that these minutes back which
taught the feel
of coral running inches under the
keel.
This piece succeeds by its thoughtful-
ness and the assurance of its line,
sculpturally solid. The same qualities
are reinforced by a keener dramatic
sense in “The Wind at Your Door,”

TO CAROLINE
Looking at you, my daughter,
Running, leaping in the bright air,
Caught in momentary laughter,
Or poised to a silent stare,
Suddenly aware —
Looking at you thus, I see
All little things, all young things,
Strange in their alien grace;
The lonely things, the lost things,
Alien to our time and place,
To the world’s pace —
And suddenly, for a space
Tis more than blood can bear,
To see your vivid face
Brushed with a creeping care,
Baffling the air—
Looking at you thus, I stand
Helpless until, the heart grown cold,
Mind sinks back to its dream of certainty,
Where platitudes replace the living mould,
And feeds, content, on husks of ecstasy,
Secure again from wandering mystery.

Reviewed Briefly
Sir Travers Humphreys: A Bio-
graphy: Douglas G. Browne (Harrap).
This English judge was the son of
Oscar Wilde’s solicitor in the Queens-
bury libel case, and he was a junior
counsel for Wilde in that case. He
ended a long career as Appeals Judge.
He seems to have been more efficient
than exciting; and to the famous cases
in which he was counsel or judge he
added little of his own personality.
Nevertheless the book is a resume of
many of them: Oscar Wilde, Crippen,
Sedden. the Great Pearl Robbery, Sir

TURN PROBLEM LAND INTC
PASTURE IN ONE SEASON
(use Tritter as a crop collector too!)
Here is the three-in-one farm implement that gives mighty service. Men on the land say: “Yeomans Tritter is the be
basic investment since the tractor was invented!”
CROP COLLECTING: Tritter can be used on sloping land as well as flat land pasture. It harvests cleanly to within;
of ground level, and feeds dirt free fodder into a huge self-emptying basket. This basket is easily detached.
o
o
Banks of heavy axe hammers rotate
at high speed. This has a flywheel
effect enabling small tractors to do
remarkably heavy jobs.
CLEARING SCRUB: Tritter with
chute and basket removed is definitely
the most effective _way of getting rid of
blackberries and other noxious plants.
It can be adjusted to clear land down
to ground level, inhibiting regrowth . . .
leaving soil ready for cultivation arid
pasture-sowing. Tritter works on the
flywheel principle, making it tough and
efficient with no small parts to break-
down or clog-up. Even with a small
tractor, the Tritter will clear land of
scrub, young tee-trees and saplings up
to Bft. tall.
PULVERISING STUMPS AND
STONES: Tritter is a wonderful land
conditioner smashing small stumps arid-
roots .'. . actually turning stones
soil. If you live in a 'shale or s
sfone area. Yeomans guarantee ....
Tritter will pulverise shale and stonj
to dust ... it will even eliminate l.|
sandstone boulders! Solid graniuj
boulders are a little too tough ■ Y
for the mighty Tritter. If > ol! ’ as j
granite to hand-size chips first, t
Tritter will turn that problem M
into rich, mowable pasture.
