A little of this. A measure of that.
Hennessy cognac is a master-
blend of old brandies . . . drawn
from the largest and finest reserves
in the world. That’s why the subtle
excellence of Hennessy cognac
never varies.
And that goes back to when
Hennessy started distilling brandy
in the district of Cognac before
Napoleon was born.
Hennessy Cognac is distilled and

Not just ‘Coonawarra’ but
COONAWARRA ESTATE
Coonawarra Estate is the original “Coonawarra”. This famous vineyard
was founded in 1890 (an illustration of the original cellars appears on
every label of genuine Coonawarra Estate wine). Years of careful culti-
vation have consistently produced vintage wines of exceptional quality.
If you prefer originals, collect and enjoy Coonawarra Estate.

LETTERS
Writers and Conscripts
Sir,
The paragraph by Professor David
Armstrong, quoted in your disparaging
report on the letter from 58 writers
against conscription for Vietnam (8.,
July 2), is surely a unique example of
political bigotry. Professor Armstrong
objects to writers of liberal opinion
signing the protest, as it was also signed
by a few Communists. If he saw a
young man being murdered, would he
refuse to help anyone trying to stop
this crime until he was sure of his
political opinions?

Worth Quoting
Sir,
Thanks for your almost total recall
in “The Eight Year War” (8., July 16).
Who else could get repeated publicity
from an estimable organ like THE
BULLETIN without doing a damn
thing to earn it except letting you
open my big mouth? However, your
interest puzzles me. After all, I NEVER
quote you!!

The Gutless Government
Sir,
Alan Reid’s report (8., July 16) on
Mr. Holt’s visit to London correctly
describes it as an embarrassment to
Wilson, but fails to mention the acute
discomfort which it has caused many
Australians who are looking in vain
to the Government for a consistent and
independent foreign policy.
It ill-becomes an Australian Prime
Minister to chide the British for
neglecting Asia when they are main-
taining forces in this area greater than
the total number of men we have
under arms. They are also spending
seven percent of their GNP on defence
while we spend less than three. In
view of these facts it is a gross im-
pertinence on the part of Mr. Holt
to criticise Britain for not doing more
to protect the average Australian’s
standard of living. If tlje Government
really believes that we are threatened
by China and North Vietnam, then it

should be taking urgent steps to
strengthen our defences by doubling
defence expenditure, introducing com-
pulsory national service, calling out
the reserves and raising taxes. If Viet-
nam is our frontline, then we should
have 50,000 troops there instead of a
derisory 4500.
But the Government is too gutless
to do this. It prefers to allow the
British and American taxpayer to meet
our defence bill while we save for a
second car and an extra week at
Surfers. Mr. Holt’s long-winded
rhetoric and excursions into verse are
no substitute for action: if his deeds
matched his words, then they would
at least command some respect, even
from those who profoundly disagree.
There is, of course, an alternative
policy towards Asia. The Australian
Party advocates a diplomatic and
economic offensive aimed at raising
living standards, strengthening demo-
cratic institutions, and developing
friendly relations with China. Aus-
tralia is in a unique position to give
a strong lead in these activities which,
if successful, would bring peace and
prosperity to the whole area. Yet the
policies of the present Government are
carrying us headlong in the opposite
direction and can end only in disaster.
What has happened to the courage,
independence, and commonsense which
have been traditional Australian vir-
tues? There is little evidence of them in
Mr. Holt’s pathetic eagerness to run
behind LBJ while the rest of the
world watches our first ventures into
statesmanship with astonishment and
dismay.

Schizophrenic Jingoism
Sir,
It is a common attitude among
so-called intellectuals to dismiss the
issue of Republicanism as something of
a bad joke which shouldn’t be carried
too far —after all, the argument runs,
there are more important things to
concern ourselves with. While not
denying priorities, I put it to Profes-
sor Kramer, Peter Coleman, and other
proponents of the sweep-it-under-the-
carpet thesis that many members of my
generation regard few things as more
important than having a genuine sense
of national identity. This can only
evolve if we replace the monarchy and
its resultant schizophrenic jingoism
with a Republican Australia, which is
a more logical and pragmatic state of
affairs.

The Parents ' Dilemma
ir > _
Brian Buckley’s “Teachers’ Dilemma”
(8., June 25) brings to mind a Parents’
Dilemma that has for some time exer-
cised the conscience of Catholic parents
in this country. A silent minority-
community is spoken for at election
time, at the opening of new schools,
at the close of academic years. It is
told repeatedly that the separate Catho-
lic system of education is satisfying the
demands of parents; it is told of “free-
d.°™ ° f T ch °ice” and of “parental
rights. It listens, of course, but has
no voice with which to reply.
Any attempt by parents to scrutinise
or evaluate the “system” is generally
looked upon as a dangerous pastime,
To criticise it and perhaps, even worse,
to prefer not to use it is to court, from
some, the title of “traitor.” As one
cleric has put it: “Such criticism dem-
onstrates a lack of Christian submis-
sion.” The State monolith can be re-
jected so long as the Church monolith
is accepted in its place. It remains to

a great moment
for all
whisky
drinkers
Connoisseurs are aware of the vital part grain plays in pro-
ducing a fine, smooth whisky. Australian barley, grown
under ideal climatic conditions, has reached such high
quality that it is now recognised internationally for its
superb whisky-producing qualities. This is important for
Australia; it is important for the entire Australian Whisky
industry. For the first time our modern distilleries, with
their highly skilled blenders and strict quality controls, are
now able to create smooth, matured whiskies of truly
unique character.
This is the era when Australian Whisky has achieved full
international recognition—so much so that it is being
sought in increasing quantities by overseas countries.
Connoisseurs are already celebrating this new era. Why
not join in and enjoy a nip or two tonight? You'll be
pleasantly surprised.

be seen whether Catholic parents will
accept the “pay up and shut up” role
that has been theirs for so long. The
ecclesiastical stick that has been used
to beat dissenting parents may be in
need of replacement by something a
little more humane in the post-conciliar
Church.
Indeed, it may even be time for
parents to be asked questions never yet
asked or answered. Do they really
want a separate system of formal educa-
tion that absorbs 80 percent of the
Church’s resources, and that is devoted
to only one section of Catholic chil-
dren? Are they prepared to accept the
monopoly of the Religious Orders,
without parental representation? Does
the ever-increasing proportion of lay-
teachers, whose training and conditions
are often inferior to their counter-
parts in State schools, require some ex-
amination of conscience? Finally, can
a Church whose spokesmen talk so
much about freedom in choice of
schools continue to refuse this freedom
to its own members?

Crisis at the Cape
Sir,
The article (8., June 11) referring
to the crisis at North West Cape pro-
vides considerable food for thought for
those who, like myself, are shareholders
in Monier. Along with other investors
in this company, I bought their shares
on the basis of Monier’s fine record of
past achievements. While the profit-
ability of their manufacturing activities
still continues (in spite of the recent set-
back in the building trade), the benefit
of this is lost altogether to shareholders
solely because of this single project at
the North West Cape, for which sole
responsibility was forced upon the
company by developments outside its
control.
For this reason, I feel, THE BULLE-
TIN could have placed greater empha-
sis on the plight of the individual share-
holders who have seen their invest-
ment tumble and who are, in effect,
called upon to finance a project for the
United States Government. It is inter-
esting to note that during the currency
of this unfortunate project the value of
Monier shares has gone down from 80
cents to about 35 cents —a loss of 45
cents per share, which is equal to about
$15,000,000 —while, as your article in-
dicates, the maximum expected loss
from the project may be in the vicinity
of $5,000,000. This is all the more rea-
son why our Government should take
urgent steps in approaching the U.S.
Government to protect the interests of
the shareholders, many of whom have
their life savings invested in the com-
pany.
And notwithstanding my belief that
Monier was well equipped to enter into
partnership with Paul Hardeman on
the Cape project, I sincerely hope that
recent Press reports of America wanting
a permanent Army base in Australia
doesn’t encourage other companies in
which I hold shares to make a bid when
tenders are called.

Saving Wild Life
Sir,
A most impressive feature of the
article “The Art of Destruction,” by
Robert Raymond (8., June 25), was
that his most up-to-date statistics were
for 1928, while most of his comments
were directed to the existing situation.
This lack of scientific fact and statis-
tics is indicative of the current situa-
tion of Wild Life Conservation in Aus-
tralia. Mr. Raymond’s article clearly
revealed the lack of scientific fact and
the concentration upon emotion .which,
while strongly felt, risks being poorly
based. However, the picture is not all
black. In the States of Victoria, South
Australia, and Tasmania associations
have been set up to grapple with the
problem of Wild Life Conservation,
bringing together around three thousand
people from all walks of life with a
common interest in a practical approach


C.S.R. Co’s ANNUAL REPORT
POINTS FROM DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
In their annual report to shareholders, reviewing the opera-
tions of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Ltd., the directors
referred to:
• Record total production of the company’s sugar mills
in Australia and Fiji, although results were below those
expected.
• Low world price for raw sugar.
• Improved results in C.S.R. building materials activities.
RAW SUGAR MILLING
Last season the group’s mills in Australia
and Fiji made a record 732,000 tons of
raw sugar. This was nevertheless below
expectations; in New South Wales and Fiji
production was far below farm and factory
capacity because of weather conditions.

C.S.R.’s Australian Mills
In Queensland in the 1965 season a
large proportion of the new cane lands
resulting from the industry expansion pro-
gramme were harvested for the first time.
Record tonnages of cane were cut in each
of our four mill areas. The handling of
these increased crops in the normal crush-
ing period was made possible by increased
mechanical harvesting and increased mill
capacity.
This year's crop at our Queensland mills
is smaller than was planned or expected
because of an unusually dry summer. How-
ever, because of the expansion it should
again make a record, given average seasonal
conditions from now on.
Because of frost damage and drought
the New South Wales mills made only
67,000 tons in 1965, a very poor output.
Fiji South Pacific Sugar Mills Ltd.
In 1965 for the second year running, in
a sequence unusual, in Fiji, a cyclone and
a flood were followed by prolonged dry
weather throughout the crushing season:
even so, the larger area farmed and the
good sugar content of the cane enabled the
1965 season to yield 311,000 tons of raw
sugar. «
REFINED SUGAR
Australia: Our five Australian refineries
sold 590,000 tons of sugar products for the
year ended 31st March 1966, 2i% more
than in the previous year.
For manufacturers’ use, substitute materi-
als, including products of the cereal indus-
tries, have lately provided strong com-
petition. Refined sugar has satisfactorily
maintained its position in the face of this
competition.
New Zealand: Sales at 130,000 tons for
the year ended 31st March 1966 were 16%
above the previous year.
SUGAR INDUSTRY MATTERS
Australian Raw Sugar Production
Australia produced 1,907,000 tons of raw
sugar in the 1965 season much the same
as in the previous season. A much higher
output (about 2,400,000 tons) had been
expected for the 1965 season.
For 1966, conditions are again generally
dry in the Queensland cane areas and it is
apparent that earlier hopes for something
like 2,500,000 tons will not be realised. The
current estimate is 2,250,000 tons.
World Sugar Situation
Throughout the year under review the
world free market price for raw sugar
(which controls the price obtainable for a
large part of Australian and Fiji raw sugar)
has remained very low between about
£Stg.lB and £Stg.24 per ton c.i.f. U.K. (the
price at the date of the report, 24th June
1966, was £Stg.l6 and on 15th July 1966
was £Stg. 17/10/-).
Statistically, there are reasons to think
that a rise in the world price is not un-
likely later in 1966, but the market can be
expected to hesitate to acknowledge this
position until the European beet sugar
crop can be estimated with more certainty
and until a surplus in South America is dis-
posed of.
International Sugar Agreement
In this general situation of market un-
certainty and great complexities many sugar
exporting countries, including Australia and
Fiji, have seen the surest hope for a return
to remunerative prices in the negotiation of
a sensible and effective international sugar
agreement. ~
The Governments oT Australia, Queens-
land and Fiji are all alert to the problem
and to the desirability «of an effective inter-
national sugar agreement and are making
positive efforts to bring one about.
Shareholders should be aware that the
company has been unremitting in pursuing
improved market conditions and a new
international sugar agreement. We play a
continuously active part in these endeavours
with, we believe, useful effect.
BUILDING MATERIALS
Total sales of C.S.R.’s building materials
for the year were well above those of the
previous year, with a pleasing rise in profit-
ability although furtner improvement is
needed to provide a satisfactory return on
the funds employed.
Fibreboard Group: The hardboard mar-
ket in Australia seems to i ave levelled off.
It is meeting strong competition from other
forms of internal lining materials. Hard-
board exports now account for a significant
proportion of the output although the prices
are low.
Gypsum Products Group: This group
operates five plaster mills and four Gyprock
plasterboard factories throughout Australia
and sales of its products continue to pro-
gress.
C.S.R. Floor Tiles: New patterns and
colours of floor tiles are being introduced
steadily to meet the continuing strong com-
petition from other Australian manufac-
turers and from imports; the latter have
gained about 50% of the total vinyl floor-
ing market.
Pyneboard (50% C.S.R., 50% Australian
Paper Manufacturers Ltd): The Pyneboard
factories, at Oberon in New South Wales,
and at Rosedale in Victoria, are operating
near to capacity. The market continues to
grow steadily. Construction of a third fac-
tory, at Tumut in New South Wales, has
begun. It is expected to operate early in
1967.
Bradford Insulation (85% C.S.R.): The
range of insulation products offered by the
Bradford companies ip New South Wales,
Victoria and Queensland is being widened
to cover new applications in building and
industrial uses.
Blue Asbestos: The overseas market for
blue asbestos has improved a little.
INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
C.S.R. Chemicals Pty. Ltd. (60% C.S.R.,
40% Distillers Company Ltd): The quant-
ity of chemicals and plastics produced and
sold by C.S.R. Chemicals and associated
Mr. J. W. Dunlop, Chairman of The Colonial
Sugar Refining Company.
companies, C.S.R.C.-Dow Pty. Ltd. (50%
C.S.R. Chemicals) and B. F. Goodrich-
C.S.R. Chemicajs Pty. Ltd. (40% C.S.R.
Chemicals), was much the same as last
year but competition, especially from im-
ports, affected prices. The value of goods
made and sold by C.S.R. Chemicals itself
was slightly lower than in the previous year
and profits were about the same.
The new plant to make higher alcohols
from petrochemical raw materials should
come into production about the end of
1966.
OTHER ACTIVITIES AND
INTERESTS
Distilleries: Sales of distillery products
for the chemical industry had been for-
tuitously high in the 1965 year and fell this
year; but sales to the general trade im-
proved.
Ocean Vessels: Less molasses than usual
was available for lifting and outward car-
goes to Fiji also fell.
Ready Mixed Concrete Ltd. (50%
C.S.R., 50% Blue Metal Industries Ltd):
The sales of the R.M.C. group for the first
ten months of the year (to the end of
April 1966) were an improvement on those
for the same period last year. While prices
were in general lower, under conditions of
severe competition, it is expected that the
trading results for the full year ending
30th June 1966 will be at least equal to
last year’s.
Alumina Project (Nabalco Pty. Ltd.
50% Swiss Aluminium Ltd., 27±%
C.S.R., 22i% other Australian interests):
The detailed study of the project, which
was estimated to take two years, is pro-
ceeding according to schedule. This study
includes prospecting at Gove to determine
the quantity and quality of bauxite avail-
able in the lease, pilot plant studies in
Italy, and hydrographic and other sur-
veys essential to the obtaining of detailed
physical and cost data.
Iron Ore Project
In the half-yearly report we said that
rising costs would necessitate further study
and evaluation of the Mount Newman iron
ore export project in the north-west of
Western Australia.
A four-party joint venture to develop
the Mount Newman iron ore deposits has
now been negotiated to the stage of a
general understanding between Amax Iron
Ore Corporation (a subsidiary of American
Metal Climax Inc.), Cliffs Western Austra-
lian Mining Co. Pty. Ltd. (a subsidiary of
the Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company of the
U.S.), Dampier Mining Co. Ltd. (a sub-
sidiary of 8.H.P.) and Pilbara Iron Ltd.
(C.S.R.’s subsidiary). It is contemplated
that part of the iron, ore output will go to
the B.H.P. group for consumption in Aus-
tralia. The other three participants will
take ore to satisfy their export contracts.
This is an enlarged and improved pro-
jected enterprise of which Pilbara iron
would own 25%. CSRI4SA

to the problem. It is interesting to
note that the most active group in con-
servation has been the Australian wild-
fowlers, who have voluntarily requested
a licence in order that funds can be
raised for the conservation of wild life
and the provision of reserves, which
would be developed to provide favor-
able habitat. North American research
would indicate that habitat conditions
control wild life populations to a far
greater extent than licensed shooting,
which is usually the most valuable
means of culling excess populations
(e.g., deer in New Zealand), and by
this means an economically important
crop can be obtained.
Perhaps in New South Wales the
position of wild life is worst and least
is being done because the finance is not
being raised. In Canada the budget for
wild life is seventy times the New South
Wales budget on a per capita basis.
There is a vast need for scientific inves-
tigation into the proper utilisation of
wild life, but this pressing task cannot
be undertaken without plentiful funds.
This is a sphere in which the Common-
wealth has done little as yet, although
the small volume of work done by the
CSIRO Wild Life Department has
made a substantial contribution to the
state of knowledge.

Company Inquisitors
Sir,
Although Mr. Clyne (8., July 2)
may be voicing the general feeling of
concern at the almost inquisitorial
powers of Company Inspectors and
Special Investigators and the harmful
effect of their reports on legal pro-
ceedings brought subsequently against
officers of the particular company,
there are a number of statements in
his article which tend to “overstate”
the effect of the law. Fortunately for
Mr. Clyne these do not affect the
thesis he puts forward.
The 1961 Uniform Companies Acts
did not introduce the concept of the
Company Inspector. Under the pre-
vious Companies Acts of the various
States there was power in the Governor
to appoint Inspectors to investigate the
affairs of certain companies. The
Uniform Companies Acts introduce
one or two new additional items in the
overall picture, although New South
Wales has “gained” a number of new
provisions. Mr. Clyne asserts that the
Inspector’s report may be used in evi-
dence against the “accused officers” of
the investigated company. However,
the majority of the High Court in the
Testro Brothers case referred to by
Mr. Clyne held that the report of the
Inspector has “. . . no evidentiary value
at all except where the fact of his
opinion is a relevant issue in any par-
ticular proceedings.” (109 C.L.R. at
page 364.)
In addition to this overstatement,
Mr. Clyne exaggerates the operative
effect of the provisions making it an
offence for a witness to refuse to answer

questions. The specific provision in the
Companies Act states that if the person
refuses to answer the question the
Inspector (and this would seem to apply
only in relation to Inspections and not
to special Investigations) may certify
this failure to the Court which may
inquire into the matter hearing evidence
both for and against the alleged
offender, (s. 171 ss4.)
Despite these “overstatements” the
position as summarised by Mr. Clyne
is certainly a serious one. The Investi-
gator or Inspector should not be allowed
to adopt the attitude of being a “judge,
jury, and executioner”; but if there is
to be some attempt to change this posi-
tion it might be appropriate to seek
some amendment of the law in relation
to the publication of these reports
before legal action is taken against the
alleged offenders. It is becoming
apparent that the “trial by newspaper”
so prevalent in that greatest democracy
across the sea is becoming an unwel-
come and unnecessary part of our com-
munal life.

COLONIAL FREETHINKERS
ffifeulletCn
86 Years Ago: July 24, 1880
ir pHE colonial freethinker, as he has
made himself familiar to us, is
a type of a certain class. Half-
educated, but not unintelligent, he
will almost always be found un-
touched by any regular system of
instruction, having obtained what
mental pabulum he may have ab-
sorbed in a precarious, hand-to-
mouth fashion. His science is the
gleaning of text-books and primers,
and his idea of the Christian code,
if he has any, the result of the
communicated lore of a well-meaning
but perhaps not too refined Sunday
School teacher. Perhaps the only
stable social institution of which
he has had practical experience is
that of the family. His life will be
found to have been a desultory, un-
even course, unballasted by any of
those guiding principles which go
so far to imbue one with gentle-
manly instincts. He lives by his wits.
The persistent vituperation of every
revered tradition sanctified by the
growth of ages, the ruthless violation
of every hallowed sentiment, and
the vulgar blasphemy of every sacred
doctrine form the precepts of his
evangel. He professes a lofty con-
tempt for those who differ from him,
and, as experience tells us, when
circumstances admit he displays all
the rancor and prejudice of bigotry
in its most repulsive form. Notoriety
is his life, and hence he will be found
obtruding his crude opinions on one’s
notice, irrespective of time or place;
while he retires within the recesses
of his own over-weening conceit when
he can no longer find hearers. This
is the type of the colonial freethinker.

JULY 30, 1966
The Big Guess
rpWO crucial points have barely
been raised in the current
discussion about the possible de-
valuation of sterling. The first
concerns the risk that Australia is
running by holding far more of its
reserves in sterling than our
increasingly non-British trade can
justify, and the second is the
apparent determination of the
Federal authorities, in particular
of Dr. Coombs at the Reserve
Bank and Sir Roland Wilson at
the Treasury, to conceal this risk.
Interpreting the few figures that
are allowed to dribble belatedly
from the authorities, it appears
that Australia stood to lose up to
$l3O million if Britain had de-
valued by the widely tipped 15
percent. One-hundred-and-thirty
million dollars is a lot of money,
a lot more than was lost in the
company crashes of recent times
as a result of taking bad risks. Yet
despite the magnitude of the
risk the Federal authorities do
not even accurately inform the
public of the relevant details and
appear to do their best to silence
debate on the issue.
The ridiculous fact is that this
figure of $l3O million is only a
best guess, reached in this way:
When the Reserve Bank gives
its regular announcement about
the health of Australia’s overseas
reserves, it does so only in terms
of our gold and total foreign ex j
change holdings, lumping together
in one figure sterling, U.S. dollars,
yen, and the rest. Every six
months the Reserve Bank releases
a little more information by separ-
ating these foreign exchange hold-
ings into three other categories:
U.S. and Canadian dollars, ster-
ling securities (the official interest-
bearing securities into which our
reserves can be placed in London),
and everything else under the
title “sterling and other foreign
exchange.” On December 31 last
year, it appeared that about 31
percent of Australia’s reserves
were in the sterling securities;
about 38 percent in sterling and
other foreign exchange; about 16
percent in gold; and about 15
percent in U.S. and Canadian
dollars. On these figures a reason-
able guess about our holdings of
sterling securities and sterling
currency would be something like
$BOO million at December 31.
Since the total of all our reserves
has meanwhile gone up by about
$lOO million, it seems likely that
Australia now has about $B7O
million risked in sterling hence
the estimate of a loss of $l3O
million in the case of 15 percent
devaluation of sterling.
But it is a fantastic state of
affairs when one has to make
guesses about such major public
issues. The fact that sterling has
at least temporarily emerged from
its crisis does not reduce the
Federal authorities’ responsibility
to reveal exactly how much of our
foreign reserves we hold in sterling,
and why. If they claim that the
release of this information would
be dangerous for sterling, then
Australians are entitled to ask what
has first priority: the safety of Aus-
tralia’s reserves or the sanctity of
sterling particularly at a time
when Britain is showing such
enthusiasm about switching her
trade and her loyalty from the
Commonwealth to the Common
Market.


THIS AUSTRALIA
In the Holt Style
THE odd toadyish leader-writer aside, everyone seemed to agree that the Prime
Minister’s National Press Club report to the nation on his U.S.-U.K. trip
was a dismal performance. In Canberra he was called everything from a
sleeping pill to a bungling bore. Harsh words were used by diplomats, public
servants, colleagues, aides, journalists, diplomats alike. Mr. Holt himself is said
to have been disappointed, too.
And yet last week after the debacle
they all talked about him, because, de-
spite this dismal performance, despite
other dismal performances, he is, it is
generally agreed, having his successes.
They are worth listing, for they are no
mean successes. He is establishing him-
self indisputably as the nation’s leader,
and his colleagues have faded beneath
his shadow as foreign affairs, defence,
and a good deal of economic policy is
being shaped by him. And the silence
of the Labor Party has amplified Mr.
Holt’s pronouncements.
It is generally agreed, too, that the
Government’s stocks are higher than
for a long time —largely through Holt
—and that it will romp home at the
elections. For all his faults Mr. Holt
goes down well with the man in the
street. He is a nice person and hard to
dislike. He has an aptitude v f'or articu-
lating widely held views with frankness
and dignity. Even Left Wingers find it
“difficult to understand” British sup-
port for general American policy in
Vietnam and criticism of the oil-tank
bombings and most Australians share
his “disappointment.” There will be
concurrence, too, in his concern that
Europeans seem to be “turning their
backs” on this part of the world, con-
taining as it does half the world’s
population.
More importantly, Mr. Holt’s suc-
cess has lain in defining the general
themes of Australian foreign policy
more sharply. All that pretence about
the meaningfulness of the Common-
wealth is forgotten and our future is
portrayed as being inelectably bound
to our relationships with the United
States and the non-Communist
countries of Asia. While we welcome
European interest we have no illusions
about the extent of their introverted
perspectives. We have even more
interest than the Americans in the
effectiveness of the military shield pro-
tecting non - Communist Asia, and
behind that shield we want to push
ahead with productive co-operation,
capitalising on evidence of growing
unity and sense of purpose in the
region. Mr. Holt did not invent these
themes, but he has consolidated them
and elevated them so that they have
come to represent the commanding
heights of our foreign policy. These
are concrete achievements. But there
remain to be examined the reasons
for the harsh words and the deep dis-
appointment in the Prime Minister’s
style.
The first mistake of the National
Press Club address was the apologetics.
A cardinal rule enunciated in every
text on winning friends and influencing
people is to attempt to sound interes-
ting. By devoting five minutes at the
beginning to warning his audience that
they were to hear again what they had
heard many times already, he almost
told them to doze off or turn off.
The second mistake was to have noth-
ing new to say at what was to be the
occasion for his great report. He came
along with a piece of paper with four
headings on it and he extemporised for
40 minutes, running haphazardly over
the themes he had spoken of previously
on a dozen well-reported occasions over-
seas. There was no need for new themes.
But a new summary might have been
attempted, a few keynote phrases
thrown in, one particular theme develo-
ped in some depth or detail, or some
appeal made; just something new said.
DISTRESSING aspect of Mr.
Holt’s current style is his apparent
inability to spell out the details of a
theme. Why not just once enliven a
comment on regional co-operation by
stopping after mentioning the Mekong
River scheme and spelling out just what
is being done and what it means for
the people living there? Instead, there
is a wearying repetition of abstractions.
This reflects an incapacity to use
staff. Mr. Holt took a number of able
senior men with him on his overseas
tour, but by all accounts he did not use
them. He tried in the old battling man-
ner to do it all himself, hardly making
any attempt to tap the minds of those
around him for ideas or phrases. He
knew five weeks ago that he was to
report to the nation through the
National Press Club and he did nothing
to prepare for it. (Almost nothing. I
forgot those four precious headings.)
He should have given someone at
home the responsibility for preparing
a draft speech at least, instructing the
man to follow the themes he was
developing as he proceeded on his tour
and attempt to apply some inspiration
to the job of summing-up. If it was
to be a report on the conclusions to be
drawn from the tour, then one of the
party should have been given the task
of co-ordinating idea collation.
Mr. Holt is attempting what Presi-
dent Johnson would not dream of
attempting. And if he cannot break
through the barriers of the bureaucratic
public-service hierarchy, he will have
to gather round him one or two Walt
Rostows to help him with speech-
writing. Someone should be there point-
ing out to him the implications of
certain phrases. To dwell, for example,
on the tour as a means of “establishing
working relationships” with foreign
leaders suggests a dreary administrative
approach to international relations and
makes it difficult to project the view
that there is a will to sell bright new
ideas. It is a theme which undermines
the attempt to portray a sense of
urgency and dynamism.
To make great play on the “dis-
covery” that President Johnson is “live
and vigorous” does imply some strange
preconceptions, and to describe the
contentious Hanoi-Haiphong bombings
with the word “exercise” could provoke
damaging retorts. Certain lines of
argument were ill-considered for
instance, the suggestion that he had
put a new and independent view in
saying that attempts should be made
to penetrate the Iron and Bamboo
Curtains. It is not new or independent,
because Bundy, Rusk, and Johnson
himself have all spoken of this. And
the corollary point always has to be
made that it is mainly China which
isolates itself, and so the initiatives we
can take are limited.
But more important than these mat-
ters of technique is Mr. Holt’s follow-
through. Here there seems to be serious
deficiencies, which again provoke
harsh words. A nation which believes
itself “on the threshold of a new and
hopeful era in Asia” will be prepared
to take a more active role in regional
economic development. It must mean
an expansion of economic aid, far be-
yond the paltry $5O million a year
being granted now. And if we are really
“more directly involved” in Vietnam
than the Americans, then we may have
to contribute proportionately as many
troops. At present the Americans have
about 1600 troops per million of their
population and we have about 400
per million. Unless our follow-through
comes along to make our performance
in Asia match up to our verbal themes,
our claims that the Europeans are
turning their backs on Asia will sound
hollow.
What gives the sceptics and critics
ammunition is the apparent contrast
between his bold sweeping pronounce-
ments in foreign policy and his ad-
ministrative caution in the work of
getting things done. Unless he manages
to close the gap the scepticism may
slowly spread. It may be refreshing to
the ordinary Australian to have the
“double-faced Pommies” quietly put
in their place by the Prime Minis-
ter, especially after years of obsequious-
ness. But it is electoral capital which
could be quickly dissipated. So could
the respect gained for the tenacity and
forthrightness of his verbal leadership.

EVEN if the ALP at its special Federal Conference in Surfers Paradise this
coming weekend produces an electorally satisfactory policy on State Aid for
denominational schools, it will still be in trouble.
As recently as the last Federal elec-
tions the ALP might have benefited if
it had switched its policy from flat
opposition to State Aid to an attitude
more electorally acceptable. But events
have now overtaken the domestic issue.
Whereas the last election could—and
was to a considerable degree—fought
on the issue of State Aid the next elec-
lions will undoubtedly be fought on
fnrpicm affaire
. '
There is evidence of disquiet within
the Parliamentary Labor Party about
aspects of the present Vietnam policy.
Labor Parliamentarian Manfred Cross
(Qld.) on his return from Vietnam
questioned the practicality of with-
■drawing national servicemen from
Vietnam while leaving the rest of the
Australian Task Force (which is Labor
policy). Labor Parliamentarian Len
Reynolds (N.S.W.), who was on the
same trip as Cross to Vietnam, ex-
pressed a similar viewpoint that was
cautious but still in conflict with the
views held by some of his left-wing
colleagues in the Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party.
Seeming breaks in the ALP’s United
Front like these are ominous enough.
The Executive could afford to ignore
them if they were in isolation. But they
are not. Nor will the “hardliners”
among the left-wing permit them to be
ignored. As it is, the Victorian ALP
Executive has already “paraded” Cap-
tain Sam Benson, Labor MHR for Bat-
man, a former wartime commander of
RAN ships and recognised as Labor’s
expert on defence. Benson was paraded
for acting as a sponsor of the Defend
Australia Committee which claims to
be a non-party organisation formed by
persons of all and no political views to
study the problems of Australian de-
fence. Benson refused to dissociate him-
self from the Committee even when
Calwell insisted he should in the in-
terests of the Labor Party,
Even this could normally be kept
quiet or at least in the background,
but Laurie Short, National Secretary
t^ie Federated Ironworkers Associa-
tion ’ is similarly a sponsor of the De-
fend Australia Committee. The Vic-
torian Executive could not

jurisdiction. Short belongs to the N.S.W.
ALP branch and is a member of the
N.S.W. ALP Executive. So the Vic-
torian ALP Executive has reported him
to the ALP Federal Executive for action.
This means that the Federal Executive
will have to do something about this
subject even if it is only discussing it.
And even discussion could point up the
uneasiness within a significant section of
the ALP on current Vietnam policy,
While Foreign policy is now a much
larger subject than State Aid (which in
view of the last Federal elections re-
suit seems to be accepted by the elec-
torate generally) there still could be
trouble on the State Aid issue itself, as
well as bitterness which must further
damage Labor’s electoral image. The
six A LP State branches are divided
three all. N.S.W., Tasmania, and
Western Australia are for State Aid.
Victoria, South Australia, and Queens-
land are against it. A compromise is
likely to emerge. Calwell has publicly
said that he is hopeful that one will be
produced.
But Mr. Allan Fraser, who sup-
ports State Aid and who is a very
tough, determined character, has quite
coolly said he will not change his
attitude, whatever decision the special
ALP Federal Conference makes on
State Aid. There are others in the
Parliamentary party who, if given a
determined lead, might follow Fraser
on this issue.
ALAN REID
Escaping Jail
IF the N.S.W. . Minister of Justice,
John Maddison, is as effective at
persuading State Cabinet to approve
his plans as he is at obtaining publicity
for his ideas, he will revolutionise the
State’s penal system.
At the end of last year he hit the
headlines with a scheme for a big
extension of prison industries linked
with the payment of economic wages
to prisoners. More recently he has
stated that he favors the idea of mak-
ing provision for the payment of com-
pensation to the victims of crime.
Last week Press, radio, and television
coverage ensured that the Minister’s
latest scheme for selected prisoners to
be allowed to work in ordinary jobs
outside jail—returning to their cells at
night—did not go unnoticed. In this
case, however, Mr. Maddison stated
firmly that legislation to provide for
this would be introduced in the coming
session of Parliament.
If he is successful in securing the co-
operation of employers and at least the
complaisance of trade unions there is
no reason why the project should not
work satisfactorily. Similar systems
have been operating for many years in
the U.K., the U.S.A. (notably in Wis-
consin and California), and more re-
cently in New Zealand. In England
the prisoners engaged in outside work
live in hostels sometimes situated out-
side the prison. There the program
has been remarkably successful, not
merely with the sort of “special pris-
oners” Mr. Maddison has in mind
(“men serving time on maintenance
orders” were mentioned) but with long-
term prisoners and persistent offenders.
Yet there is no doubt that the adop-
tion of such a scheme represents a re-
volutionary development. For the
acceptance of imprisonment as a sub-
stitute for execution and transportation
was largely due to the fact that it was
a form of banishment. The offender
is in effect exiled to a walled colony
outside society. Maddison’s plan re-
flects a directly antithetical conception.
The economic advantages of the sys-
tem are obvious. Not only can the
prisoner pay for his own board and
lodging, he can also be made to con-
tribute to the support of his dependants.
In addition, his productive capacity is
not, as it largely is in prison, lost to
the community.
Unfortunately, no systematic attempt
has been made anywhere to assess the
benefits of the system in terms of the
ultimate resocialisation of offenders and
the diminution of recidivism. If Mr.
Maddison can be persuaded to make
provision for evaluation and follow up
studies as an integral part of the pro-
gram from the outset, he will transform
what might otherwise be merely an-
other piece of eclectic reformism into a
significant step in the direction of a
rational, scientific penal policy.

Under the Iceberg
The Man who did not want to he Archbishop
Archbishop M. L. Loane (third from left) is congratulated by (I. to r.) Archdeacon
H. G. S. Begbie, Bishop A. J. Dain, and Archdeacon C. A. Goodwin.
MARCUS LAWRENCE LOANE,
Lord Archbishop-elect of Syd-
ney, was once summed up by a
famous visiting English bishop in these
words: “He is an iceberg.” The assess-
ment was made on the basis of brief,
formal encounters, all in the presence of
the then Archbishop of Sydney or other
members of the diocesan bureaucracy.
On one view, it could have been a
slick generalisation with obviously de-
rogatory overtones. The Englishman,
however, has a reputation in Church
circles as a shrewd judge of character,
a kindly man, and a high intellectual
given to such terse summaries as this,
which on another view, like an iceberg
itself, has more below than appears on
the surface.
Not only is there vastly more to the
character of Bishop Loane than the vis-
ible tenth by which the general public,
church congregations, and all save his
closest friends judge him; that visible
tenth is a wholly misleading guide to
what lies beneath. The reserve, the
slight glaciality, the precision of ex-
pression, the apparently inflexible
attachment to principle, the general
seriousness of manner and approach are
all completely genuine. But beneath it,
latent, lurk qualities which have already
in the last week begun to show, and
which when they finally burst through
will prove perhaps the biggest shock the
dough-like Diocese of Sydney has re-
ceived in this century.
Who, hearing Marcus Loane solemnly
extolling the virtues of his exemplar,
the late Archbishop Mowll, for ex-
ample, in the reverential tones tradi-
tionally employed from the dais at a
Synod meeting, or who, reading his flat,
pedestrian, biographical sketch of
Mowll, would know that he is the best
mimic of Mowll’s distinctive manner-
isms of speech and department? The
fact is, however, that he can not only do
this; he has a store of wildly improb-
able stories about Mowll of the jnost
side-splitting kind. The question of
disrespect does not, of course, arise,
Loane’s affection and respect for Mowll
is irrefragable.
He has few common qualities with
his predecessor, Bishop Gough; but a
surprising number in common with
Mowll: the same shyness, massive mem-
ory, enormous patience, and a boyish,
almost childlike and innocent, sense of
fun. Like Mowll, he is lost in the kind
of company which relishes the Ox-
bridge variety of repartee and wit.
His obstinacy could on occasions
almost—but not quite—match Mowll’s.
There are, after all, limits to the extent
to which a young priest can stand out
against his archbishop and Primate,
For years, for example, he resisted
Mowll’s wish to consecrate him and
make him an additional bishop co-
adjutor. By the time the older man
had worn him down, it had been
necessary meanwhile to appoint Bishop
Kerle, who thus became the senior
coadjutor.
Ironically, Bishop Loane, when he
was a mere priest himself, felt, and
expressed, frequent misgivings about
the episcopate. This was not, as some
mistakenly supposed, because he was
tinged with Presbyterianism or enter-
tained any doubts about the ancient
Catholic three-fold ministry of bishops,
priests, and deacons; it sprang from
a sound-enough suspicion of the misuse
of episcopal power. To the Reverend
M. L. Loane, as he then was, all bishops
needed careful watching.
Bishop Loane is, of course, an Evan-
gelical—and an Evangelical of a par-
ticular kind. Many who share his
theological views will yet be shocked
to find that however firmly he holds
to them per se he never now confuses
them with quite unconnected aspects
of church order, government, and dis-
cipline. Anglicans enjoy a synodical
form of church government in which
a nice balance must be preserved be-
tween the duties and powers of bishop,
priests, and laymen; the bishop who is
not thoroughly constitutionally minded
and scrupulous in observing constitu-
tional conventions will run into serious
difficulty. It was Hugh Gough’s mis-
fortune, as it is Marcus Loane’s good
fortune, that the former never really
understood and accepted this, while the
latter is a constitutionalist in his very
bones: in this respect he stands more
close to the Bishop of Adelaide, Dr.
T. T. Reed, a High Churchman, than
to any Evangelical bishop.
Two examples of his constitutionality
may be given. He long opposed accep-
tance of the present Constitution for
the Australian Church, on grounds sub-
stantially the same as those advanced
by Dr. Reed. He led the opposition
to it in Sydney. Immediately it came
into effect, however, he made it clear
that he felt bound in loyalty to accept
the view of the majority, and to work
under the terms of the Constitution.
SIMILARLY, he is opposed on theo-
logical grounds, like the majority of
Sydney clergymen, to the use of Euc-
haristic vestments, which have been de-
clared “illegal” by Ordinance in the
Diocese of Sydney. Repeal of this Or-
dinance (the like of which is unknown
elsewhere in the Anglican Communion)
would require the assent of the House
of Clergy, the House of Laity, and the
Archbishop of Sydney in Synod assemb-
led. Asked, a few days before the
meeting of the Synod which elected
Archbishop Gough, what he would do
if he were himself elected Archbishop
and a Repeal Ordinance were passed
by the clergy and laity, Bishop Loane’s
reply was unequivocal. “My personal
convictions have nothing to do with
such a matter.”
He can sometimes be so fair and
utterly detached that those who observe
him just do not believe what they see.
A fortnight ago, for example, a mem-
ber of the Synod asked him whether he
thought Dr. Babbage would make a
good Archbishop of Sydney and, if so,
whether he would allow himself to be
quoted as saying so. Bishop Loane’s
response was again unequivocal. Dr.
Babbage, in his opinion, would make
an excellent choice, and his questioner
was at liberty to relay this opinion to
any of the archdeacons or other
diocesan top brass.
There are vast areas even of theolo-
gical and philosophical thought of
which he is ignorant. Of developments


in these fields in the twentieth century
he knows little. Of political science he
is innocent, of the natural sciences and
technology he knows nothing.
His comments about Vietnam a few
weeks ago, in which he was joined by
the two other coadjutor bishops, is a
case in point. After the statement was
issued, he admitted fully and truth-
fully to the Church Press that he had
not read any of the basic official source
material on the subject and that his
personal experience of Vietnam
amounted to a brief stay-over in Saigon.
He has been accused of Erastianism
—of holding that the Church is in
some degree subordinate to the State.
The charge is at most only partly true,
and stems from his instinct (which
after all is not confined to bishops)
that those who conduct the great affairs
of the State, or who are surgeons or
journalists, have presumably been
trained for their jobs just as Marcus
Loane has been trained as a priest. He
assumes competence and good faith in
them, and this is an indication at once
of his own honesty and ignorance.
When he can be goaded into examining
the bases upon which politicians, for
example, reach their decisions, his
attitude changes. He has little creativity
himself; but he has extraordinary pow-
ers of analytical penetration, a subborn
regard for the truth, and obstinacy
enough to persist in the search for it.
He did not want to be Archbishop
of Sydney. As he put it to a friend
before the Synod: “If I am elected, I
shall not sleep at night. If I am hot
elected, I shall sleep soundly.” A
specialist in the Reformation and some
other aspects of Church History, he
is more aware each year of what he
does not know of other things, and of
how this hampers the flowering of
his mind. As Archbishop, he can never
hope to read even the 50 or so books
each year that he has managed re-
cently.
His home life helps here. His wife,
Patricia, presides over a home of un-
usual calm and serenity. It is a dis-
ciplined, orderly, lovi n g home,
common-sensible, with perhaps a touch
of the austere in some ways; but one in
which even an archbishop can both
relax and work. It is a contrast to the
Babbage home, turbulent, brilliant,
stimulating, ever creative, books stacked
in piles in most rooms, echoing with
sounds ranging from Scriabin to some
new mechanical device for the kitchen.
The best example of the innocence
or, as some would say, ignorance
of Marcus Loane is his comment on
a magnificent new book on the Re-
formation. He said: “The strange thing
about it is that it is written by a
secular historian!”
What would Lord Acton have
thought?
Of course, in many ways, the Eng-
lish Bishop was right. Marcus Loane
is an iceberg. Icebergs are clean. And
rather beautiful.
Dispute Settlers
What the ACTU thinks of the Commissioners
By R. J. L. HAWKE
AMONG the more unsubtle submis-
sions made by the Commonwealth
Government in the 1966 National
Wage proceedings was the plea to the
members of the combined benches
(Wright, Gallagher, Moore JJ, and
Commissioner Winter) that they should
conceive their decision-making roles as
involving something akin to the col-
lective responsibility of a jury. While
the analogy was objectionable—as
pointed out by the presiding Wright J—
the reasoning behind it was understand-
able.
The Government was anxious to
avoid a repetition of the 1965 spec-
tacle—a deep and open division be-
tween the majority and minority judges
rendered even
more unedifying
by the subsequent
disclosure of the
President, Si r
Richard Kirby
(with Moore J
in the minority),
that they knew-
nothing of the
majority judg-
ment before the
day on which it
was delivered.
Such a public
parade of inability
to reconcile its
own internal dif-
ferences did not
seem to the Gov-
ernment likely to engender general
confidence in a tribunal charged with
settling other people’s disputes.
In the event unanimous decisions
were handed down in respect of basic
wage and margins. The processes of
subsumption seem to have been at work.
We find in the judgment of Wright J:
“Had I had the sole responsibility for
present decisions they may well have
differed in some respects from those
now announced; but the high respect
which I have for the views and opinions
of my colleagues has given me confi-
dence in the fairness and justice of the
decisions in which I now concur.”
The Government, therefore, no doubt
welcomed this display of harmony but
would have found precious little else to
enthuse about in the judgments. This
lack of enthusiasm would centre not so
much on the amount of the immediate
basic wage increase—the $2 can be
easily accommodated and was no doubt
acceptable as a fillip to a somewhat
lagging economy —but rather on the
conceptual approach to their function
set out by the various members of the
benches.
Our reaction in the Trade Union
movement, as expressed officially by
Bob Hawke
ACTU secretary Harold Souter on the
day of the decision, can be best under-
stood in the same perspective but with
the opposite emphasis—a feeling that
the immediate increase could well have
been greater tempered by the distinct
satisfaction of seeing the Commission re-
turn to acceptable basic principles of
wage fixation and away from the aber-
ration of the 1965 majority decision.
In 1965, when virtually the same
issues of principle were before the Com-
mission, the effective majority judg-
ment was handed down by Gallagher,
Munro, and Sweeney JJ. This provided
no increase in the basic wage and a
mere 6/- in margins. While the
majority did not expressly adopt the
employers’ pro-
ductivity theory,
i.e., wage increases
should be limited
to the predictable
increase in nati-
onal productivity
for the ensuing 12
months, the judg-
me n t embraced
the associated
concept that the
only increases to-
be awarded by
the Commission
should be those
regarded as “not
incompatible with
stability of prices.”
In adopting this
position, the majority specifically
rejected the principles, asserted by the
Commission since 1961, that the real
value of award wages should be main-
tained and increased through time by
making adjustments for both prices
and productivity.
And so the stage was clearly set for
the 1966 proceedings—with one inter-
vening circumstance. This was the pub-
lication of the Vernon Report in Sep-
tember, 1965. Its Chapter 7 on “Costs,
Prices and Wages” filled to overflowing
the cup of success created for the em-
ployers by the 1965 judgment, or so it
then seemed to those advising our
friends on the other side. Here again
was to be found the overwhelming
emphasis upon “price stability,” the in-
junction against taking account of past
price increases in fixing award wage-
levels, the reassurance about the appro-
priateness of business pricing and trad-
ing policies based on the so-called con-
stancy of distributive shares between
wages and profits.
From this point the employers’ case
was eminently predictable. They urged
the Commission to adhere in 1966 to
the conceptual approach contained in
the “historic” 1965 majority judgment,


confined, as it was now put, in all
points of substance and principle by
the exhaustive investigations of the im-
partial, highly qualified, much-assisted
Committee of Economic Enquiry.
Within this approach the employers
urged the Commission to regard an in-
crease of 6/- as being the maximum
amount compatible with price stability
on the basis of the predictable increase
in national productivity.
The Commonwealth Government
was at one with the employers in ask-
ing the Commission to give pre-
eminence in its deliberations to seeking
to ensure the maintenance of price
stability. The Government suggested a
“moderate” increase in wages would not
be incompatible with this objective, but
refused to give any sort of quanti-
fication to this submission. The under-
standable dissatisfaction of the Bench
at the time to this word-spinning was
eloquently expressed in the judgment of
Wright J: “Such suggestions are just
_ 55 . , , u • j
meaningless to one who is under an
obligation to reduce his reasoning to
terms of currency.”
While sharing the employers’ em-
phasis upon price stability, the Com-
monwealth found itself able to com-
plete its submissions without a single
word of reference to the Vernon Report
(a remarkable achievement but cer-
tainly consistent with the Government’s
intention to proceed as though the En-
quiry had never been held).
The _ Unions’ position before the
Commission was straightforward. Our
claims in respect of basic wage and
margins were founded on a recognition,
shunned by the pre-1965 judgments,
t* l3 * the two fundamental characteristics
1S a °d any other developed West-
ern economy are increasing productivity
an d rising prices. The Commission’s
function, under the constitution and the
legislation which creates it, is the just
settlement of industrial disputes.
. The Commission is not created, nor is
** equipped, to achieve price stability .
If ** attempts to assert in the achieve-
went of price stability by refusing or
minimising award wage increases it will
e f rustr , ate “ °y the operations of basic
e ‘°. nomK forces beyond Us control.
Price increases will still occur, but they
win ie accompanied h ter iis J.
Hom and inequities in the wage struc .
ture There is no p re dictable relation-
ship between the order of increases in
award wages and subsequent price
movements. For these reasons the
Commission must give primacy to its
legal task of settling disputes. The 1966
judgments are best understood as an
acceptance, to a significant extent, of
these principles.
Without intending any disrespect to
other members of the benches, 99 per-
cent of those picking up the four judg-
ments on July 8 would have turned first
to that of the presiding judge, Mr. Jus-
tice Wright. A non-participant in any
of the national basic wage or margins
cases since 1958, Wright J was the
only presidential member who had not
pronounced upon those basic issues of
principle between the parties. With the
other presidential members split 3-2 in
1965, his position was clearly decisive,
His Honor’s judgment leaves no
doubt as to his conception of the role
of the Commission. “Its only function
under the law is the prevention and
settlement of industrial disputes.”

should be central to the Commission’s
task.’ Mr. Myer, in the course of
his evidence at our hearing, made it
clear that the Committee felt that the
price stability element ought to be
paramount ‘ought to be of most
importance.’
“I am left unmoved by this exhorta-
tion; firstly, because I think it in-
appropriate that this Commission
should lend itself to the pursuit of
any policy, but also by reason of the
fact that none of the members of the
Committee who gave evidence nor
Mr. Robinson (Counsel for the
Employers) offered a convincing
explanation of what price stability
connotes in concrete terms.”
Wright J then confirmed his posi-
tion by adding: “In paragraph 7.111
the Committee expressed ‘sympathy
with the view that regular . . . small
increases in award wages are greatly
to be preferred to irregular large ones.’
I feel obliged here to repeat the com-
ment I have made concerning the
Commonwealth’s reference to
‘moderate’ and ‘large’ increases, and to
add the comment that I find the
reference to ‘regular’ and ‘irregular’
increases entirely unhelpful because
those words could mean anything or
nothing according to the whim of the
reader. This passage is also unacceptable
to me as implying that it puts the im-
plementation of an economic policy
before the settlement of an industrial
dispute upon its substantial merits.”
On the question of adjustment of
award wages for movements in prices
the presiding judge, while not agreeing
to automatic adjustments each
quarter, said: “I accept the doctrine
that award rates of pay should be
kept in reasonable accord with the
movement of retail prices.”
Mr. Justice Moore, who with the
President had formed the minority in
1965, reaffirmed the conceptual
approach to wage fixation contained in
his judgment of that year. His judgment
contained the following observation:
“It is my firm opinion that
the Commission would endeavor to
ensure that the wages it fixes at a
given time as just and reasonable con-
tinue to be able to purchase approxi-
mately the same amount of goods and
services unless there is good reason
why they should not. It should not
leave the adjustment of its wages to
market forces which would be the logi-
cal outcome of the employers’ sub-
mission. In my view the question of ad-
justment for past price increases is more
a matter of equity than of economics.”
After quoting from the evidence of
Sir James Vernon, Mr. Myer, and
Professor Karmel to support his scepti-
cism about what is precisely meant by
“price stability” Mr. Justice Moore
enunciated this position: “It (the Com-
mission) should take into account both
price movement and productivity, but
should not allow itself to be over-
concerned with the elusive concept of
price stability.”
Mr. Justice Gallagher, who formed
one of the majority in 1965, on this
occasion found with Wright and Moore
JJ in favor of a $2 increase in the
basic wage. His Honor’s judgment in
1966 expressed adherence to what had
been said in 1965 but seemed on this
occasion to give much more emphasis
to the need to adjust for price increases
which have occurred. His judgment
also indicates that he was influenced by
two aspects of the evidence of the Ver-
non Committee members; first the in-
ability to say anything definitive about
the relationships between wage and
price movements, and, second, the
severe doubt cast upon one of the
assumptions of the 1965 judgment, i.e.,
the constancy of distributive shares
between wages and profits.
The reasons for decision handed
down by Mr. Commissioner Winter as
a member of the reference bench hand-
ling the unions’ margins application and
parts of the employers’ total wage ap-
plications contained a clear exposition
of principles of fixation similar to those
expressed by Mr. Justice Moore.
»pHE judgments of all members of
the two benches were unanimous in
granting further increases to those de-
pendent upon low margins, a welcome
acknowledgment of the inadequacy of
the existing rates to provide anything
like a reasonable standard of living. It
is clear also that further increases in
margins should be associated with the
inquiry that has been assigned to Mr.
Commissioner Winter. It is premature
to comment upon the possible implica-
tions of this inquiry or the reference to
the possible expression of award wages
as total rates except to say that the
policy of the trade union movement
strongly supports the existence of dis-
tinctly identifiable basic wage and mar-
ginal elements.
The judgments, of course, are tre-
mendously important in the industrial
field. They have, I suggest, a signifi-
cance for the whole community going
beyond their economic impact. The
Commission has now reaffirmed what
it was in effect saying before 1965:
our function under the constitution is
to settle industrial disputes. It is true
that in the settlement of those disputes
we operate in a milieu, and have an
impact which is substantially different
from that which was envisaged when
the constitution was established. This
is true of all economic decision-making
in Australia today. If the community
wants to create the constitutional and
administrative apparatus appropriate to
these changed circumstances, let it do
so. Until and unless that is done we
are not going to amend the constitution
covertly by abandoning the function
which it now appoints for us of settling
industrial disputes to pursue some
economic policy of price stability. Par-
ticularly we refuse to do this when it
is apparent that the achievement of
this objective is impossible unless we
do bring the whole of our constitutional
and administrative structure into line
with the realities of the second half of
the 20th century.

The French Revolution
Napoleon IV?
By EMERY BARCS
DURING the recent visit of Presi-
dent de Gaulle to the Soviet
Union his hosts staged a war-
game for him at the military training
field of Aladino, near Moscow. The
elite Taman guard-division demon-
strated how it would repulse an attack
with the support of tanks, remote-
controlled rockets, and with artillery
firing tracer projectiles.
But before the soldiers had gone into
action, before a single shot was fired, a
deafening explosion startled the on-
lookers. A mock tactical atomic grenade
sent up a mushroom cloud on the hori-
zon. The Soviet Army showed the Presi-
dent how it would open some future
major battle.
It is unlikely that de Gaulle needed
any morale booster to justify his own
nuclear arms program. But if the inter-
national outcry about the French atomic
tests in the Pacific had raised doubts in
his mind, the show at Aladino must
certainly have dispelled them. For one
of the unpleasant facts of present-day
life is that to count for a first-rate
Power a nation must be—besides many
other things—also a nuclear Power.
And to lift France once again into the
select and greatly shrunk company of
the world’s power-elite has been the life
ambition of Charles de Gaulle.
“I intended,” he wrote in his
memoirs after his churlish semi-
retirement to Colombey - les - deux-
Eglises in 1946, “to assure France pri-
macy in Western Europe, to co-operate
with East and West and, if need be,
contract the necessary alliances on one
side or another without ever accepting
any kind of dependency.” In May, 1958,
when, after 12 years in the political
wilderness, the Algerian events cata-
pulted de Gaulle back into power, he
began to implement his program. He is
still implementing it. His critics in the
Western World doubt that he will suc-
ceed. They see in de Gaulle’s lofty
actions at home and in his showy trips
abroad, including the recent trip to the
Soviet Union, nothing more than a
grandiose political theatre which will
leave no tangible beneficial residue for
France in the long run. That this view
is shared by many Frenchmen was
demonstrated at last December’s Presi-
dential elections, when 45 percent of
the voters opposed a second seven-year
term for him. Yet if he fails it will
not be for lack of trying.
De Gaulle is a natural target for a
cartoonist. But those who see little
more in him than a caricature—a
haughty mystic, a self-appointed heir
to Louis XIV the Roi Soleil or a
“Napoleon IV” —make an immense
mistake. They grossly under-estimate
the man’s often disconcerting realism
and his shrewd practical sense. De
Gaulle may be lofty but he is not aloof.
Not only his earlier years—his grasp
of modern mobile warfare before World
War 11, or his calculated and success-
ful mulishness as the leader of Free
France during the war (he explains the
rational reasons for it convincingly in
his memoirs) prove this. Much of what
he has done during the past eight years
shows that de Gaulle is not an erratic
visionary but a pragmatic thinker.
Eight years ago —exhausted by the
war of Indo-China, torn by the Algerian
rebellion, plagued by Government
crises every few weeks, and with a
run-down economy—France was a near
nonentity in world politics. Today she
is a factor in the international arena.
Not as big a factor as de Gaulle would
like her to be or as he is sometimes
trying to show that she is. Neverthe-
less, after Washington, Moscow (and
Peking?), Paris once again rivals any
other capital as a centre of world
politics.
(f pHERE are three main reasons for this
rapid rise in international prestige—
the growth of French economic
strength, the build-up in the country’s
military power, and the partial success
of Gaullist diplomacy.
Economics allegedly bore de Gaulle
• —all he knows about this subject is
that it is important. But he has had the
good sense to hand over the field of
economics to efficient technocrats who
can do much as they like as long as
they do not clash with basic Gaullist
foreign policies. They have managed so
well that during the past eight years
production per worker has increased
by an impressive 4.5 percent annually,
and today the French franc—backed
by reserves well in excess of $5OOO
million, 80 percent of it reputedly in
gold—is one of the world’s strongest
currencies.
While during the past eight years
industry and foreign trade have pro-
gressed well, the problem of French
agriculture remained a problem until
last May when de Gaulle won a vital
victory in the European Economic
Community on the financing of farm-
product within the Common Market.
The gist of the agreement which the
EEC “six” signed on May 11 was that
French farmers would receive annually
a subsidy of between $lOO million and
$l5O million from a Common Market
fund.
Ironically, while this victory will
greatly increase the prosperity of
French farmers —and the standing of
the Gaullist regime with them it
may also restrict the sort .of freedom
of action which de Gaulle holds as
essential for his country, l'or from
now the EEC partners of France ■ —
but especially West Germany will
have something with which to re-
taliate should the French become over-
assertive again in the Common Market.
This aspect of the May agreement has
not escaped the attention of French
economic and political writers.
There has been much discussion
about the real value of de Gaulle’s
nuclear force de frappe. When fully
developed (by 1972 if everything goes
according to schedule) the force will
consist of 62 Mirage-4 jets carrying
plutonium bombs; 25 ground-to-ground
missiles with a range of 2500 miles
and a fleet of Polaris-type submarines.
Compared with the American and
Soviet stores of nuclear military hard-
ware all this does not seem to be im-
pressive. Yet unless Red China
catches up quickly the force de
frappe will be the third most power-
ful nuclear war establishment in the
world within the next five or six years.
The “force” is not supposed to be an
offensive weapon but a deterrent. In
theory a deterrent against any aggres-
sor; in practice —the range of the French
atomic missiles suggests against
aggression from the Soviet Union. De-
spite his suspicions about American
policy, de Gaulle has hardly thought
that America might contemplate in-
vading France.
What de Gaulle did suspect and
probably still suspects, however, is the
“unreliability” of the U.S. protective
nuclear umbrella for Western Europe,
including France. America, de Gaulle
holds, may not risk a nuclear show-
down with the Soviet Union if the
Kremlin made only some “relatively
minor” demands on some Western
European country. Washington has,
of course, repeatedly rejected any sug-
gestion of this kind. Nevertheless, at
least some people outside France—
notably the “Gaullists” in the West
German Christian Democratic-Christian
Social team —seem to share the view
that the U.S. would not go to an
atomic war with Russia in a “minor
emergency.”
Gaullist diplomacy has been trying
to create a special image of France.

It is the image of a country strong
enough to help her friends in need and
to look after their interests at all times.
Yet not so overwhelmingly powerful
that it could, or wished to, dominate
them. In other words an affectionate
Big Brother on whom one can lean
without risking being intimidated into
subservience by him. This formula of
prominence without domination has
been made credible by de Gaulle’s
handling of the former French terri-
tories in Africa. In 1958 de Gaulle
started the avalanche of decolonisation
in Africa when he offered independence
alone or with' France to the 15 coun-
tries of Afrique francophone. Only
Guinea opted out of the French family
(Mali has often been an intractable
“little brother”) and the rest has had
no reason to regret its decision to stick
to France in one way or another.
Mainly through French support the
states of Afrique francophone have
become associate members of the
European Economic Community. Be-
sides favorable trade-terms with the
members of the EEC, the organisation
is also providing considerable aid to
French Africa. The total sum over the
five years of 1963-1967 will be about
$560 million. France proudly asserts
that of all nations of the world she
spends the largest proportion of her
gross national income on non-military
foreign aid (about 1.8 percent of the
G.N.P. annually). This claim is true.
But it is not always realised that ex-
cept for relatively minor sums spent
elsewhere, French foreign aid goes to
former territories of the country and 80
percent of it goes to Africa.
Although it is difficult and risky
to read de Gaulle’s complicated mind
it seems that in January, 1964, when
he recognised Red China he came to
the conclusion that the time was ripe
to re-extend the global influence of
France to the Far East exactly because
his country became “a disinterested
third party” in the area after 1954.
De Gaulle declared at a Press con-
ference shortly after the recognition
that “on this continent (Asia) there
is no peace and no war imaginable
without China being involved, and
it is inconceivable to suppose that a
neutrality treaty could ever be con-
cluded concerning the States of South-
East Asia, to which we French attach
a very special and cordial attention,
without China being a party.”
So far, the President has had no more
luck with Peking than anybody else
had. But since the end of 1963, when
Prince Sihanouk cut himself off from
U.S. aid and asked France for assis-
tance, de Gaulle has established very
warm relations with Cambodia. France
is now tops in that country. And while
it would be naive to believe that Prince
Sihanouk has any influence in Peking,
he is certainly as well informed about
what goes on in the top-echelon of
the Red Chinese as any outsider can be.
And he is a possible intermediary.
Hence the visit de Gaulle will pay him
next September when he stops in
Phnom Penh en route to the Pacific
may become more than a simple cour-
tesy call.
But while de Gaulle wants to
secure global goodwill foy France, his
main concern is Europe,' which is and
must inevitably always remain the main
permanent problem of his country. De
Gaulle believes that the cold war is
over, that Western Europe has suffici-
ently recovered—economically and
militarily—to stand on her own feet
and that the two great power blocs led
respectively by the U.S. and by the
Soviet Union have become obstacles to
the security, prosperity, and peace of
Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals.
Hence he wants a loosening of
the blocs and a regrouping of the
forces: the Americans should go home
across the Atlantic, the Soviets should
withdraw their forces behind their
frontiers. Western Europe, including
a reunited Germany, would lean on
France, Eastern Europe on the Soviet
Union, but there would be free contact
between all.
far this “European policy” of de
Gaulle has had only one—and most
questionable—result: the weakening of
the Atlantic Grand Alliance. And this
can help the further development of
the President’s vision of a Europe of
the Fatherlands under French promi-
nence only if the Kremlin decides to
go all the way with de Gaulle. And
the results of the recent visit of de
Gaulle to the Soviet Union suggest
that the Soviet leaders are not pre-
pared to do that. It seems that they
still consider the U.S.—and not France
—as the partner with whom it would
pay to make world politics.
The Western European nations agree
with Moscow on this account. They
too have more respect for (and con-
fidence in) the U.S. nuclear deterrent
which exists powerfully than in the
President’s future deterrent and in his
Big Brother attitude.
The declaration signed at the end
of de Gaulle’s visit to the Soviet
Union contains only openings for pos-
sible future developments but no hard
and fast agreements on a common
policy. The “hot-line” between the
Kremlin and the Elysee Palace is
hardly more than a symbol; the un-
derstanding to hold regular consul-
tations may or may not be useful; the
stipulation of a European settlement
“mainly” by European nations suggests
that either one or both sides realise
that America could not be excluded
from such a settlement. Anyway, as
a good tactician de Gaulle has kept the
door open for a retreat or for a come-
back into the Western family of nations
as a full ally. He has insisted that
France is still a member of the Western
Alliance despite her exit from NATO.
And during his whole trip to the Soviet
Union he said not a single hostile word
against the U.S., against Germany past
or present (not even in former Stalin-
grad) or against any other Western
country.

APPLETREE HILL, the $7-million
Lend-Lease housing settlement, all de-
signed by Robin Boyd, folded last
week. This was to be the first large-
scale housing area of its kind in Aus-
tralia. The houses were all Boyd-
designed, Boyd-planned, Boyd-land-
scaped, and the powerlines were all
underground.
Judging from the first half-dozen
houses built on the site, it looked very
promising indeed. The prices were not
overhigh, $17,000 to $21,000. But
although 10,000 people visited the site
there were very few takers. Robin
Boyd himself was unable to explain
why it didn’t work. “I just don’t
know,” he said.
Melbourne real-estate experts had
some ideas. They felt that the timing
was bad, there was precious little money
around, and that possibly Lend-Lease
just panicked a little early. Maybe,
too, buyers didn’t want to be told where
to put their trees or to conform to a
pattern.
Anyway, the six exhibition houses
now there are up for private sale, and
Robin Boyd says wistfully that maybe
he will try again some day.
Viva Mexico!
SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY has im-
presario Harry Miller promoted the
Ballet Folklorico of Mexico that he has
sold not only the dance company to
local audiences but the whole country
as well. The Mexican Government now
plans to open a tourist bureau here to
mop up some of the interest aroused by
the Folklorico.
Mr. Miller’s ideas of promotion are
not, of course, those of other theatrical
managements here, who tend to make
you feel that an actual performance is
really only something rather unpleas-
ant under their noses. From the some-
what insane moment about a year ago,
when Mr. Miller signed up the Folk-
lorico for a $400,000 deal (“They’ve
been around quite a long time, but who
else would be game to bring out 80
people and 5J tons of scenery and cos-
tumes?”), he has planned his promo-
tion.
A “Project ’66” team w e nt to Mexico
to do a program on the Folklorico.
They had to find their way there, were
looked after there by the Mexican
Government, and got a lift back in the
ballet company’s charter plane. Also
aboard the plane was a quantity of
display material which has been used
by Myers, in Melbourne, and Grace
Bros., in Sydney. Grace Bros, has
tackled its Mexican promotion with a
thoroughness which draws admiration
even from Mr. Miller. “I walked
through the corset department the
other day and they had up ‘Viva
Berlei!’ and they’ve even had things
like ‘Fountain brand Mexican red
tomato sauce’ in their advertisements,”
he said. But what Mexican merchan-
dise have they had to sell? “Nothing.
Absolutely nothing, except the Folk-
lorico.”
From the beginning, Mr. Miller said,
he knew that the company would have
to be sold on color, so all display
printing had been in expensive four-
color process. Mr. Miller also sent
Miss Jan Mitchell, his publicity officer,
to Mexico for a couple of weeks simply
to soak in atmosphere.
These bold approaches to publicity
must have caused major seizures in
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust, one-
third partner in the enterprise. How-
ever, Mr. Miller assures us that the
Folklorico will make money, which
might come as something of a surprise
to the Trust, too.
Mr. Miller will have the Folklorico
back here in years’ time, when it
will present its Olympic Games pro-
gram and when it will visit the cities
it has not been to this trip.
The Folklorico has been for Mr.
Miller the sort of major project he
dreamed of during the years of shunt-
ing people like the Rolling Stones,
Tom Jones, and Judy Garland in and
out of the Stadium and the Show-
ground.
In future he hopes to spurn neither
the small attraction nor the spectacu-
lar, but to make concert management
his “bread and butter.” His next pro-
ject is the German drama group Die
Bruecke. “The German Government had
them available,” he said, “but nobody
would pick them up. I thought, there’s
a few dollars to be made out of them,
so why shouldn’t I make them?”
In concert management, he hopes,
if not in the immediate future, then
within five or six years, to be bringing
out artists like Stern and Piatagovsky.
“The ABC’s highest rate per perform-
ance is $1000,” he said. “That is way
below the top fee. Australians have
been getting the cheapest entertain-
ment in the world. It’s about time it
stopped, but you’ve got to offer people
the best, and they have to come to
know that your management will offer
only the best. This sort of manage-
ment used to exist, but it doesn’t any
more. Williamsons haven’t got this
quality, but the Taits had. The Taits
had it. And you don’t build up some-
thing like this in a hurry. It would
take 10 or 15 years, but once you’ve
got it, you’ve got it.”

Among the Pasties
By BATMAN
THE biggest shock for an ingenue
from Melbourne was the discovery
that one couldn’t tell the differ-
ence. Back home in Melbourne we do
have the occasional strip show, but we
don’t strip our boys. This shock came
quite early at “Les Girls.” I was admir-
ing one creature very much as she dis-
robed. She was very tall, very languid,
with beautifully shaped limbs. With her
piled-up blonde hair she reminded me
of Baroness Fiona von Thyssen, who
is to put the sex into our Melbourne
Cup this year.
Just then the fellow beside me said:
“Psst. She’s a boy.”
“But, but, the shape of her . . .”
“Simple,” he went on crushingly,
“they do all that with silicon injec-
tions.”
From that moment the evening was
ruined. When my heart began to pound
I was unsure whether it was pounding
in a decent Melburnian manner. All
the young fellows I noticed had an
instinct for what were males and what
were females, just in the manner that
a young male spiny anteater can im-
mediately detect a young female spiny
anteater. Alas, my instinct did not work.
The male strippers, like good stewards
aboard ship, were more graceful and
infinitely more efficient. There was
never a lag in the swing of a hip as
they doffed a skirt and never a fumble
for a catch on a bra.
However, for the fussy, the range
in Kings Cross was enormous. There
was a choice of at least ten strip joints,
and with my friend Mr. Tanner I tried
to take in as much of the local culture
as possible. There was a place that
advertised that one could dance with
bottomless Go-Go girls, and a rival out-
fit that advertised one could dance
with topless Go-Go girls. We refrained
there. This seemed just a little too ex-
travagant for a first visit.
Finally we gave our four star
Michelin award to the Pink Pussy Cat.
This was because it had the sort of
purity of Lifebuoy soap it didn’t
pretend to be anything else. There was
no big production, no fancy dialogue,
no bunny-type waitresses, practically no
evidence of food, just lots of naked girls
and . . er . . boys.
As one enters one notes a sign: THE
MANAGEMENT REQUIRES
GENTLEMEN TO WEAR COATS
COLLARS AND TIES, but actually
the best sign is around the back and I
think this is probably the best sign in
all Sydney, a real collector’s item: NO
STRIPPERS ALLOWED IN THE
KITCHEN.
While we are handing out awards,
the best of all unquestionably was
Brigitte Darnelle, the “Israeli-born
French” stripper. She came out all in
red with great rooster feathers on her
tail. She threw off her clothes fiercely
and looked at her audience, head high
imperiously, with looks of vast con-
tempt. This, I feel, is the ideal relation-
ship between strippers and strippees,
there should be a love-hate feeling.
Kindly smiles only cloy the operation.
Brigitte had one special technique.
The Karate exponent as he delivers
a blow always gives out with a staccato
scream, which helps to shock and over-
power his opponent. Brigitte did the
same. Cold-faced as she tossed off her
undergarments, she screamed. When
she threw off her bra, she screamed.
Her final act was to lean over back-
wards until her hands touched the floor
and her utterly splendid breasts made
pyramids toward the ceiling. At that
moment my instinct was working fine.
My companion was whispering again:
“She’s the highest-paid stripper of them
all. She gets 70 quid a week. When they
start as junior strippers, they get 20.
If they’re any good they quickly work
up to 30. Average for a really good one
is about 40.”
However, the charm of the Cross, I
learned, was the fact that there was so
much employment available for a
young lady. For example, Last Card
Louie, who has the Pink Pussy Cat,
also controls about 60 percent of the
bookings around the clubs, and there’s
a beautiful understanding between them
on the timing of the shows. So the well-
equipped girls can appear at two clubs
a night, and one or two like Brigitte
can even get to three clubs a night.
Each club has three or four floor shows
nightly, so a young lady may have to
take her clothes off 12 times in a night.
Oh, they are very busy.
IT was interesting to note the simi-
larity between stripping and wrestling.
Just like wrestlers have to create a
make-believe character, so do strippers.
We had Princess Aloha, who stripped
Tahitian style. We had Pinky, all in
beads and short skirt, who stripped
Roaring Twenties style. At the Crazy
Horse we had a fire-eater stripper, a
stripper with a carpet snake which
stroked and coiled about her bosoms,
and there was a Wild West stripper in
gold lame Levis who started her act
by tossing off her six guns to the tune
of the Yellow Rose of Texas.
Then, glory be, at the Pink Pussy
Cat we had “Jedda” —“discovered in
the Nullarbor Plains, the only real
aboriginal stripper in the world.” Jedda
was fairly pale of skin and she strip-
ped to the tune of “My Boomerang
Won’t Come Back.” The climax of the
act was a little tasselling. Sydney strip-
pers, you must understand, are obliged
by law to wear something, so they
strip down to pasties, which look like
milk bottle tops. Jedda had tassells on
Denise
Darnell
[?] [?]
her milk bottle tops which she got
moving in opposite directions like
contra-rotating propellers. It seemed
an unusual achievement for a girl from
the Nullarbor.
The audiences were interesting. The
young ones just sit frozen faced, never
showing any emotion.
Many of them come back week after
week, and always sit in the same seats.
Yes, some go for their weekly footy,
others go for their weekly bosoms.
Then you get the middle-aged men.
They come in large parties, often in
evening suit, direct from some club
or convention. They don’t have the
cultivated stony stare of the regular
strip savant. They get noisy and shout
Yippee, Ole, and You Little Beautee
at the falling of each garment. Then
you get the tourists, the passers through
Sydney, with a remarkable number of
Asians. For some reason Asians adore
stripping.
The only place where one sees
females in the audience is at “Les
Girls.” Here you do get a proper stage
show, a prbper meal, and humor of
the old-fashioned “Mo” variety. The
compere chairwoman is Peter Moselle,
and he cracks jokes like:
“Mummy, what is a lesbian?”
“Don’t worry me now, dear. Wait
until Daddy comes home and ask
her.”
But if the show was heavy, Peter
Moselle, with a voice like Clark Gable,
made an entrancing female, and his
best line was his last: “If you are
disgusted at what you have seen
tonight, make sure you tell everybody
you know, and we’ll pack the bloody
place.”
There was a good crowd at the Crazy
Horse, and one. couldn’t help but be


startled to see, as master oi ceremonies,
dear old Judd Lane. Now Judd Lane
used to be one of our idols on GTV9
television in Melbourne. He was the
choreographer and balletmaster for the
quite good standard of ballet on “In
Melbourne Tonight” with Graham
Kennedy.
Well, dear reader, Judd is now
choreographer and dancer at the Crazy
Horse. He is dressed like an Afghan,
acts as the straight man with the
strippers, and still dances very well
indeed, but it seemed a long way from
the days when he was helping to
flog Gloweave shirts and Raoul Merton
shoes on IMT.
The girls, while they are waiting to
go on, will sit down in the audience.
A nice big blonde told us: “It’s a bit
frightening at first you’re terribly
shy. But when you’re doing it four
times or more a night, it just becomes
a job like any other. And you can
travel. You can make big money in
London, performing in Soho. Manila’s
another good place. So is Tokyo, par-
ticularly if you’re a blonde. They say
the Japs love the white ones.”
With these thoughts in our minds
we went on to the Paradise Strip
Palace, where the cast was headed by
Sandra Nelson.
Here the dialogue had something of
the aroma of old cheese. Candina came
on dressed Grecian style and we were
told that she was the girl with “the
two big personalities” and that in 90
seconds we would know exactly what
he meant. One character was so
impressed by her personalities he tried
to grab her by the ankle. Immediately
a solid gentleman, with all the presence
of Primo Camera, said, “Come on you
out,” and he was out, fast as you
bat your eyelid.
But the climax we were waiting for
was Sandra. She was very formal in
long black velvet evening gown with
matching long black gloves. She was
introduced with the unforgettable
lines: “We now give you Sandra Nel-
son the most talked-about, most-
publicised girl in the world today. The
first girl to go topless on the Manly
ferry.”
She waltzed about, stripped slowly,
languidly, and it wasn’t a very skilled
performance to us old connoisseurs, who
had endured an evening of it. Yet at
the finish, when she stood there in her
black velvet G-string and milk bottle
tops, it was obvious that she was a
fine figure of a girl and it was possible
to see what other gentlemen may have
seen in her. She smiled amiably, gave
a peek-a-boo wave, and disappeared
behind the curtain.
It was after 1 a.m. and it was all
over. There was no National Anthem.
Les Tanner and I thought that we
might adjourn to the kitchen at the
Pink Pussy Cat. That was one place
safe from strippers.

The Foreign Press
Discovering Australia
By SAM LIPSKI
THE foreign Press is slowly discov-
ering Australia. The growth of
interest has been highlighted
particularly in the past six months as a
succession of VlPs—Healey, Humphrey,
Rusk, Stewart, and the SEATO minis-
ters and entourage —have brought with
them droves of foreign newsmen. The
presence of Australian troops in Viet-
nam has provoked a special interest in
many editorial offices around the
world. And so Australians themselves,
as much as their politics, have also
aroused a growing curiosity.
The “foreign Press” is, of course, a
misleading term. Most of the news about
Australia which the rest of the world
gets to hear still comes from Australan
journalists directly or indirectly because
it is based on Australian newspapers.
But it is possible to draw some distinc-
tions between three different ■ kinds of
outlets. This tripartite division does not
include the News and Informatoin De-
partment, which is a Government
agency, or Radio Australia, which plays
an important part in what Asia especi-
ally hears about us. But in the commer-
cial Press world there are first the itin-
erants who come for a special confer-
ence, a special article or series. Some
recent examples are the special issues
of the “Illustrated London News”
(which ran some particularly perceptive
articles on urban Australia), a “News-
week” cover story, and the color sup-
plement in the London “Observer.”
The second category covers the news
agencies. There are the big three
Australian Associated Press-Reuters,
United Press International, and Associ-
ated Press—and representatives for
smaller agencies like Agence France
Presse (Frank Chamberlain), Indo-
nesia’s Antara (Mohammed Chudori),
the Soviet Union’s Tass (Victor
Khamara), and Japan’s Ji Ji (Akira
Takahashi), each of whom has one
representative in Australia.
The third category covers the perma-
nent correspondents who represent
newsmagazines or newspapers. There
are not many of these. And only two
of them, “Time’s” Ernest Shirley and
“Newsweek’s” Peter Harvey, have a
large and regular Australian audience
for their reports on Australia.
A former South African, Ernest
Shirley’s association with “Time” goes
back some fifteen years when “Time”
asked him to report the continuing
story of Paramount Chief Designate
Seretse Khama of Bechuanaland and
his controversially white wife.
Shirley came to Australia in 1963
after “Time” was forbidden to keep a
representative in South Africa. Since
then he has been to the United States
twice because his employers feel that
all correspondents who are not natives
of the United States should get to know
the country for . which they are princi-
pally writing.
Like “Time” correspondents every-
where, Shirley may file 3000 words on a
story and find that 700 appear in
radically rewritten form. How does
Shirley feel about the unusual relation-
ship between “Time’s” editors and cor-
respondents in which, as a senior
“Time” man once put it to me: “We
write for our editors, not our readers.”?
Says Shirley: “Even though my stories
are rewritten and sometimes there are
technical errors added, none have had
their meanings or intention changed. I
know that some correspondents have
complained that it’s happened to them,
but it hasn’t happened to me.”
In addition to “Time,” Shirley has
also been writing on Australia for other
Luce publications, “Life,” “Sports
Illustrated,” and “Fortune,” as well as
providing material for books and edu-
cational aids which “Time” also pub-
lishes. Early next year, when “Life’s”
new regional edition, “Life Australia,”
begins publishing locally, the Sydney
bureau will get an additional corres-
pondent who will look after the new
publication.
‘TpME’ S” main competior in the
overseas newsmagazine field, “News-
week,” set up a Sydney bureau only
four months ago shortly after it, too,
began publishing an Australian edition.
A former Walkley award-winning re-
porter for the Sydney “Daily Tele-
graph,” Peter Harvey, became the first
full-time correspondent for “Newsweek”
after some 18 months of freelance writ-
ing for the magazine. Harvey’s associa-
tion with “Newsweek” began while he
was reading it one quiet night in 1964
on late shift at Police Rounds. He found
one story on Australia so full of
inaccuracies that he wrote an indignant
letter to the editor (“as one journalist
to another”) pointing out the mistakes
and generally attacking the carelessness
of the story. Back came a long letter
some weeks later thanking him for his
interest and asking him to do some-
thing about it. Earlier this year after he
had helped in the preparation of the
“Newsweek” cover story “Australia on
the March,” which launched the Aus-
tralian edition, “Newsweek’s” editor,
Osborn Elliott, here for the launching
ceremonies, offered him a staff job.
Basically, the relationship between
correspondents and New York editors
on “Newsweek” is much the same as
at “Time,” except that the degree of
rewriting is usually less and corres-
pondents are often given their own
byline for a story, which almost never
happens at “Time.” As at “Time,” the
editors and writers in New York, in
addition to Harvey’s copy, have before
them news-agency material, newspaper
clippings, and research material, out of
which the final report is “fashioned.”
Where a correspondent like Harvey or
Shirley exerts his main influence is on
providing suggestions for likely stories
and in his ability to “sell” a story to
editors 12,000 miles away, usually by
cable, occasionally by mail. For no story
is sent unless New York requests it.
The other full-time correspondents
outside the news agencies in Australia
represent leading newspapers. The
veteran American correspondent Tilman
Durdin, who has covered the Pacific
area for more than a generation, was in
Tahiti last week to report the French
nuclear tests for the “New York Times,”
which he represents in Sydney and for
which he travels widely in the whole
Pacific area. The “Christian Science
Monitor” is represented by Australian
A 1 Norman, who is also based in Syd-
ney.
Because of his paper’s emphasis on
political and diplomatic news, Stewart
Harris, the London “Times” correspon-
dent, is based in Canberra. Not that
Harris has restricted himself to only
diplomatic and political reporting; there
is, for instance, his pointed and witty
writing on the Australian Press. The
other Canberra-based correspondent is
“Pravda’s” Yuri Yasnev, who himself
made news shortly after his arrival by
being refused entry into New Guinea.
But whatever the influence of these
newspapers and however widely read
the newsmagazines may be, none can
approach the news agencies for the
sheer amount of news sent out of Aus-
tralia or, for that matter, the number
of people who will be reached by that
news. For it is from the news agencii s
that most of the world’s population
which can read, hear a radio, or watch
a television set get to hear about Aus-
tralia. The biggest of the agencies re-
porting Australia is Australian Associated
Press, which acts as Reuters’ correspon-
dent for Australia as well as being the
principal source for overseas news in
the Australian Press. It is estimated that
the Reuters service goes directly or in-
directly to 6455 daily newspapers in
112 countries with an aggregate daily
circulation of 276 million. Because of
the size of the AAP-Reuters combina-
tion, the agency has an advantage over
its two main competitors, UPI and AP,
as it can afford to keep open the
costly leased lines between London and
Sydney.
Thus AAP sends to London between
4000 and 5000 words of news as it
breaks each day and a further 13,000
words a month on “timeless” stories, or
“situationers” as they are known in
agency jargon. These are background
reports on subjects ranging from the
development of ski resorts in Australia
to plans for new techniques in aviation.
What all the stories coming out of AAP
have in common is that they are not
“opinionated.” As the Managing Editor


of AAP, Mr. Duncan Hooper, put it:
“We are concerned here to provide a
basic service of news. We do not give
opinions or interpretation unless we can
Source them.” Generally the news going
to London from where it is relayed to
Reuters subscribers is based on reports
in the Australian Press. For special
events such as the recent SEATO con-
ference, AAP will send its own reporters
to provide an independent coverage.

Associated Press Bureau Manager in
0 , . . ~ .
Sydney is an Australian, Gordon Tait.
Tait has been AP representative for
Australia since 1945 As with other
Bureau Managers, whether in the agen-
cies or newspapers, his main problem is
covering a country with so many scat-
tered centres of news. He must rely
heavily on his stringers, the Austra-
ban journalists in every capital city
and most country centres who look to
the foreign Press as an extra source of
income and outlet. As the only staff
representative for AP, an American
agency with clients in 103 countries,
he is part business manager, part
special correspondent, part sub-editor.
He covered the SEATO Conference
himself, for example, and filed 15,000
words in a week.
United Press International is an
American agency with close to 6000
clients in 114 countries. Their Sydney
bureau manager is an American,
Charles Burnard, who took over in
1964 after a twelve-year term as
manager of UPl’s bureau in Hawaii.
UPl’s News Editor is an Australian,
Brian Dewhurst, assisted by another
Australian, Joe Hilger.
Burnard feels that while more Aus-
tralian news is getting into the Ameri-
can Press there is still a long way to
§° *° change the widely held view of
Australia as a land of boomerangs,
koalas, and kangaroos. But he did feel
at . there was a big potential for
creating a good understanding of Aus-
traJ!a ,j n s .^ a -
Similar views came from Reuters
, i j u * r
when asked about their assessment of
interest in Australia b Asian sub _
scribers . The M in 7 Editor of
ReuterSj M r. Stuart Underhill, in a
message which appropriately came
through on the AA p.R eu ter-leased
cables said that on a tour of South-East
As j a - n j anuar y be bad found a grow-
ing interest f n Australian affairs,
« It was particularly evident in
Malaysia, Singapore, and Japan,” he
said- “f found what one might
call a shrinking interest in the affairs
of Europe and, to a lesser extent, the
United States, and a growing demand
for more news of Aus tralia.”
There are unconfirmed and largely
unconfirmable reports that some Ameri-
can newspapers are planning to open
up bureaus here in the next 18 months.
At least one London paper is also re-
ported to be planning the appointment
of a staff correspondent. The revolu-
tion in mass communications is not only
bringing the rest of the world closer to
Australia; it is making it easier and
more certain that Australia will be
brought closer to the rest of the world.
79 Hours a Week
And Luncheon with a Republican
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THE Governor of New South Wales
rose from his desk, and seemed
to go on rising. Rather, you
imagined, in the way General de Gaulle
would, an equally tall, large man.
We sat near a gas fire, a handsome
enough piece of warming apparatus as
gas fires go, in his study, which in
ancient days was a billiard room one
end and a chapel the other. Concealed
lighting, Sir Roden Cutler’s idea, gave
warmth to the leaded church windows,
and the rest of the room, heavily
panelled and built with high stone ceil-
ings, was as you’d expect in a house
some 130 years old. No signs of
modernity. The furniture, mostly brown
leather or dark brown polished wood,
the carpet a crimson and beige pattern,
State maps concealed in a sort of
billiard-board attachment on the wall,
a big green metal Government-issue
filing cabinet in one corner with a
clutter of briefcases and outmoded
red diplomatic bag, an official portrait
of Queen Elizabeth over the Governor’s
desk, a personal one of her on a side
table, all designed, you felt, to fit in
rather than detract from the regal
atmosphere of Government House.
It came as a surprise, therefore, to
hear Sir Roden say that along with
the royal family they were develop-
ing the common touch.
“These are,” he said, “changing times,
the Commonwealth is changing, the
United Kingdom is changing, the
United States and elsewhere. These
things have their effect on the tradi-
tions that go with Government House
and Governors. I am a strong tradi-
tionalist in the sense that I think we
should know our past and our history,
but equally I think there is no point
in hanging on to something that has
no meaning when to have a meaning
it would have to be loved. I hope I
am able to adapt myself to changes
and at least have my finger on the
pulse of what the community is feel-
ing. The Queen and Prince Philip
among the royal family are in touch
with this feeling, here and elsewhere.
The Queen knows as much about New
South Wales as I do. Certainly the
royal family itself has gone a long
way to if I may use this terrible
term develop the common touch
and, along with them, as representative
of the monarchy, we are developing
the common touch. I hope to think
of ways and means that will give Gov-
ernment House some meaning and
purpose as the pinnacle of the consti-
tutional pyramid.”
When Sir Roden accepted the job
of Governor, which he did without
hesitation (“Big decisions are easily
made. It’s the small ones, like what
you’re going to wear in the morning,
that are more difficult”), he took the
view that it would be unwise to come
with fixed ideas until he had an oppor-
tunity to feel his way. He did, on the
other hand, come with “aspirations
and hopes” on things at the back of
his mind, and one aspiration was that
he would like “to bring Government
House as close to the people as pos-
sible.”
' In order to do this he entertains as
many people from as many walks of
life as possible, a method which cannot
be described as startling or original.
Prince Philip thought of it first. There
is no way of judging how successful
this has been, but there have been
recent criticisms of the Buckingham
Palace get-togethers.
However, along with artists, judges,
poets, those of the sporting fraternity,
and others, Sir Roden has had 600
schoolchildren round to Government
House (not all at once). They were
given the lowdown on the history of the
house, walked round the grounds, and
took afternoon tea with the Governor
and Lady Cutler. They had all received
personal invitations and afterwards Sir
Roden was most impressed with the
many who wrote to thank them for
a lovely afternoon. He was also im-
pressed by those of the three and a
half thousand guests invited to their
garden party who wrote saying it was
a splendid afternoon despite the ghastly
rain.
The small luncheon party is a par-
ticularly useful occasion for discover-
ing what local feeling is up to. Unlike
Press interviews, controversial subjects
are welcomed with open arms. “I
wouldn’t like to think they couldn’t
say what they thought was right.
Everyone has different views, and I
certainly have no objection to dis-
cussing things of interest at the lun-
cheon table.” He told a harmless
anecdote about a Republican who, he
said, had more in common with him,
the Governor, than he knew, and asked
me not to write it down. As host he
would naturally expect his guests to
observe common courtesies. “I have
had, and enjoyed, long discus-
sions over Australia and the Monarchy,
but I would not be prepared to discuss
a Bill going through Parliament, or
discuss an individual.”
Change was in the air, but Sir Roden
would be the last to suggest change as
radical as, for instance, the Governor
becoming Ombudsman. “I am the
third-youngest Governor to be
appointed, I was in the midst of an
active diplomatic career with quite a
few years to go, but I didn’t take on
this job to sit back and retire and
wither. I took it on with a strong belief

that traditions should be maintained,
and the essential dignity kept, but I
would never suggest a change such as
the Governor becoming Ombudsman.”
He said there are State occasions and
they have to be fulfilled properly—why,
even the most Republican represen-
tatives love to see the Lord Mayor’s
Show in London—and they should be
done with dignity and ceremony. “The
traditions of Government House in this
way. have a meaningful use. Tradition
doesn’t mean stuffiness. That I regard
as something quite different. In essence,
tradition is not pompous or stuffy.”
The telephone rang and Sir Roden
told the caller he would not like to go
to a reception in white tie, what did
they wear here? A pause. “All right,
I’ll wear black tie, that’s all right.”
Checking on correct dress with
Government House is a frequent occur-
rence, but they didn’t make the rules, it:
was the person at the other end who
asked for guidance. “I don’t mind what
I wear to fit in, provided it’s not sloppy
sweaters and baggy trousers,” Sir
Roden said. That particular prob-
lem had been what to wear to
a reception which Sir Roden would
later leave and privately go on to the
ballet. Well, he hoped he was going to
the ballet, the tickets hadn’t been
booked yet. Sometimes, though, this
quick-change business was tricky. He
hadn’t yet been required to do a quick
switch down a country lane, but there
were often times when even something
as basic as a wash was difficult to
achieve without a mad dash back to
Government House for half an hour.
Representing the monarch, he said,
cannot be taken lightly. It is a task
that—how should he put it? —doesn’t
come to all. No, he didn’t discuss with
his wife whether he should accept it,
because, he said, when it was offered
they both knew the answer. He didn’t
seek the job for two reasons: “First, it
would be very presumptuous to seek it;
and, secondly, it is a decision that no
matter what you do restricts any per-
sonal interests you can follow, any per-
sonal life you can follow. It is a full-
time job, both from a work viewpoint
and socially. You cannot even go out
and hope to do the things you would
do as a citizen in the ordinary way.
One must give something back to the
community. My wife and I think it is
more blessed to give than to receive—
to be biblical for a second —one has got
to. Having accepted it, my wife and I
did so with humility.”
When he filled in the census form, in
the How Many Hours do you Work bit
he put 79 hours a week. “That is an
average week—you don’t work those
hours for money. I could not. Neither
could I sit back and receive advantages
without putting something into the job.”
What advantages, for instance?
He laughed and said he supposed he
was bound to say, none. “They are not
of the material kind, although I sup-
pose to the public it looks very nice to
live in a house of this size, but then the
public forgets the tall ceilings, no cen-
tral heating, a large staff to keep the
place going. Gracious old house, yes,
sense of history, yes, some satisfaction
in being able to live in it—but this is
not a material advantage. I suppose
they say I am driven everywhere to
functions, driven back, that I don’t get
caught up in traffic jams. True, but I
cannot relax with a pint of beer and a
sandwich at a cricket match, it means
meeting people at a function, making
speeches. Quite an effort, a mental
effort, remembering what they do, what
they are interested in. Physically, too,
shaking hands with everyone is tiring.
“For a function you do a lot of
homework. I know the names of the
top ten or twelve people for dinner,
learn a potted biography on them. My
wife and I must leave on time, be
punctual. We know whether they pro-
pose playing the National Anthem, we
know whether they will make a speech,
or if there are debs to be presented,
and so on. Otherwise, without doing
homework, you are left looking around
and this makes the people whose func-
tion you are at nervous.”
Sir Roden says he is not nervous, but
he supposes he is sensitive to atmos-
phere. “I have been 20 years in diplo-
matic service and if, after twenty years,
you feel nervous about speeches, enter-
taining, and that sort of thing, you could
not live with it. On the other hand, it
doesn’t mean one is blase about it all.”
He didn’t dislike being interviewed,
either. He didn’t exactly like it, but
the sight of someone scribbling short-
hand notes didn’t upset him.
His day begins about seven o’clock
each morning, excepting Saturday, when
it is nearer seven-thirty. He reads the
papers, listens to the radio, has a light
breakfast, and comes down to the office.
Sometimes he goes for a walk down
Macquarie Street, sometimes swims
before breakfast in Government House
pool, then into the office at nine o’clock,
to work until 12.45.
He, his wife, and private staff gather
in the sitting-room and go in for lunch
after a tomato juice—he rarely has a
drink at lunchtime —then he returns to
his desk about 1.45 p.m. “We usually
gather about 4.30 for a cup of tea, the
private staff and myself, come back
here until 5.30. Then I usually go for
a walk with the family, return about
twenty-five past six, watch the news on
television, dinner at 7 p.m., then there
are usually a few more things to be
cleaned up, something to be signed. I
make a point, however, of getting to
bed not later than 12, and prefer 11
o’clock, if possible. Working seven days
a week it is vital to have a good night’s
sleep/’
There is no time off in this job, he
said. Saturday is the day when everyone
is off work and that’s when the public
functions are so everyone can go to
them. “Sunday morning there is church,
and Sunday afternoons I try to spend
with my family, my four boys.
“Getting to bed before midnight is
important, because—well, you take my
present week: every night there is some-
thing on.” He read a list of engage-
ments, as mixed a bunch as any repre-
sentative of the Queen would hope (or
otherwise) to land. Dinner for this and
that Ambassador, a welcoming recep-
tion here, a charity show there. One
day a conference, the next a luncheon
party at Government House, Lady Cut-
ler meeting the Country Women’s
Association.
His four sons are at home now for the
first time. There is David, doing
Commerce at the University of N.S.W.,
Anthony, 17, Richard, 14 last Saturday,
Mark, all day boys at Shore. The
sound of four lusty boys in Government
House does not disturb officialdom.
“They are used to living in official
houses and they are busy doing their
own things, they have their own bicycles,
friends, dog.”
Would Sir Roden, as Governor of
New South Wales, ever be prepared to
make a stand like his predecessor Sir
Philip Game, who took it on himself
lo dismiss a Premier? He replied:
“There is a loneliness in this job, but
there are proper avenues for seeking
advice on important questions—indeed,
it is almost mandatory to seek all views
on matters which come up. It is wrong
to believe that the Governor is the
Queen’s representative only in the sense
that he merely signs documents.”
Inevitably a Governor’s term ends.
There is no set term. There has always
been an unwritten, unspoken under-
standing that it is five years, but there
is no specified term of office. Many of
Sir Roden’s predecessors served from
eight tq 11 years. What can a Governor
do at the end of his time? Is Sir Roden
worried that it will be the end of his
diplomatic career?
“One must seek other avenues. Lord
Wakehurst became Governor of Nor-
thern Ireland, Sir John Northcott devel-
oped a few business interests, Sir Eric
Woodward retired.
“One might say that when the
Governor gets to the end of his term
he has to concentrate on the fields that
won’t be connected with things of a
controversial nature.
“Good Works, in fact.”

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
The Trust Clings To Life
By PATRICIA ROLFE
IT might seem that the final achieve-
ment of the Australian Elizabethan
Theatre Trust was to bore everybody,
even those who have bored us for so
long with their criticisms of the Trust.
Even the announcement by the chair-
man of the Trust, Dr. H. C. Coombs,
that an approach had been made to the
Federal Government and that a Coun-
cil for the Performing Arts might be set
up within six months provoked only a
lacklustre response. For what, from the
terms in which Dr. Coombs made his
announcement, would a Council for
the Performing Arts be except Dr.
Coombs in a different set of cap and
bells?
A week or two ago Dr. Coombs, ap-
parently overcoming his aversion to en-
tering into public discussion, which, he
is said to believe, is not in keeping
with his job as Governor of the Reserve
Bank, but, which, one would think, is
essential to his job as chairman of the
Trust, appeared on ABC television in
“Stop Press.”
He delivered a lengthy statement
which may have been intended to make
clearer what the Council for the Per-
forming Arts might become, although
the issue remains fairly cloudy. The
program did, however, make clear that
Dr. Coombs’ idea of dialogue is not
everyone’s. Perhaps, too, the program
made much clearer how the Trust has
been run for the past decade.
Yet, despite the sense of boredom the
Trust seems to arouse in anyone less
than obsessed, the Trust and its his-
tory are quite interesting, and its
future —or, as many seem to hope,
its lack of one—of some importance.
In several ways the Trust seems to
reflect Australian life in the past decade.
To stray for a moment into the Lucky
Country, too .many on the Trust board,
without disrespect to its best members,
appears to be a striking example of the
second-rate provincial elite (really only
the classic, comic mob of silvertails of
folklore) which Donald Horne says
characterises our public life.
The Elizabethan got under way in
1954 because of the energy and en-
thusiasm of Dr. Coombs, and it is per-
haps unkind now to recall that he
talked then of making the theatre in
Australia “the same vigorous and sig-
nificant factor in national life as it was
in England during the reign of Eliza-
beth the First.”
The Trust was not intended as a pri-
vate body spending public money
one of the most frequent criticisms of
its activities. It became one with the
not unnaturally diminishing enthusiasm
of the public and of business and the
subsequent increased appeals to the
public purse. There was a thrilling race
in 1954 to raise £lOO,OOO because other-
wise the Queen might not lend her
name to the enterprise. The then Prime
Minister, Mr. Menzies, gave £25,000
on behalf of the Commonwealth;
£lOO,OOO was topped and everyone
breathed a sigh of relief. Elizabethan
it was.
Then Dr. Coombs and his board took
off their garden-party hats and grey top-
pers and set about establishing in the
name of Her Majesty permanent drama,
opera, and ballet in this country. With
£100,000; when the Canadian Govern-
ment had voted a capital sum of
$50,000,000 to do a larger, but not
vitally different, job. Ridiculous? But
Dr. H. C. Coombs
no one said so. The Elizabethan was
floated on a sea of goodwill. As critic
Roger Coveil said some years later, the
Trust has been “embalmed in praise.”
The Trust board survives because
Australians—or enough of them—cling
to the belief that with long white gloves
go opinions which must be worth more
than other opinions. At base, the only
views on the arts which are worth much
are (as in any other field) those of
people working in the field. Perhaps in
the theatre you might add professional
critics whose views may be taken for
what they are worth, that is, the price
of their newspaper.
Some members of the Trust board
may have worked hard, some may have
learnt something about the practical
aspects of theatre, some may have felt
at times repressed by the forceful per-
sonality of the chairman, but all have
been appointed and served because Aus-
tralians go on playing a game of ladies
and gentlemen in a world in which
there are no more ladies and gentlemen.
The Trust board has been described
by Dr. Coombs as a “body of public-
spirited citizens.” This could be readily
admitted, but the performing arts are
not a worthy cause. They are a pro-
fessional endeavor.
As it stands, the Trust board parallels
a milk board with only consumers’
representatives (and, perhaps, con-
sumers who prefer chocolate-flavored
milk because the chairman happens to
like chocolate-flavored milk). This ex-
cludes the four members who work, or
have worked, for the Australian Broad-
casting Commission—Dr. J. R. Darling,
Mr. Talbot Duckmanton, Mr. Neil
Hutchison, and Sir Charles Moses. On
the reasonable assumption that theatre
is in competition with television, and
to some extent with radio, for audi-
ences (and on the assumption that the
Trust is in competition with the
ABC—although competition is hardly
the word —for public funds), these, you
might say, represent four nominees of
a brewery on a milk board.
But the Trust board has had many
parallels in recent years in the boards
of public companies, these being made
up of people who took seats, feeling
that all that was required was their
name and presence. Shareholders of
some of these companies may now feel
with some bitterness that something
more was required. And an almost
person-for-person comparison could be
made with the Sydney Opera House
Committee.
The Trust board also survives be-
cause of the lingering Australian mis-
trust of the expert (perhaps this exists
only with the second-rate provincial
elites). With this goes a belief that
the person with no practical experience
in a field will be “detached,” whereas
he will generally clutch at the first set
of prejudices to clothe his nakedness.
Even now, some of the more idealistic
theorists on what the Council for the
Performing Arts should be are so strong
on “detachment” that all they can
have in mind is a choir of angels.
In a country run and overrun by
boards, the idea that a body dispensing
public money should not include
representatives of that section of the
community likely to benefit, or at least,
have to call on an official advisory panel
representing the interest, is one which
any card-carrying member of the
Country Party would think entirely
whimsical.
(Another belief widespread through-
out the Trust, which considering the
composition of its board seems to have
remarkably unsophisticated ideas on
finance, is that because it is the “tax-
payers’ money” all taxpayers are en-
titled to their little bit. On this prin-
ciple, we would all receive a sprinkling
of superphosphate each year, which we
do not. If subsidised superphosphate
goes to the country where it will do
the most good, then subsidies for cul-


ture should also go where they will do
the most good.)
There are, of course, arguments
against interested parties being on a
body distributing public funds' to the
arts, but a different situation has al-
ways obtained with the Trust, a body
distributing funds which is also an en-
trepreneur What argument can there
be for any enterprise being run by
people with no direct experience in
[he field? The Trust board is not even
under the compulsion to seek advice.
It does seek a great deal - “But,
Lord,” said a Trust employee, “the
people it gets it from!”
~ . , . , , rrv
Another respect in which the Trust
seems to mirror our recent past is its
infatuation with public telations ln the
50s and disenchantment in the 60s.
The. Trust in fact, has had quite
efficient public relations on a day-to-
day basis, which has resulted in many
unremarkable artists returning over-
seas with bulging cutting-books. How-
ever, in common with some other local
enterprises, the Trust now is inclined
to blame its public relations depart-
merit, and not its productions, because
its image is poor.
The composition of the Trust board
for the job it has had to do may appear
ridiculous, and capricious, but given
enough , time and public patience the
board, in theory, might have evolved
firm and coherent policies for the
establishment of the performing arts in
this country.
However, one thing the Trust board
ts nature could not do and has
not done is “ convince any large num-
ber of P eo P le > hat the Performing arts

board has failed to convince Govern-
ments of the need for consistent and
substantial support for the arts and
now, apparently, is prepared to give up
trying a i together . At the other, the
composition of the board can gain
little sympathy and probab l y earns
strong resistance for the theatre from
the man j n tbe street w hen the cause
j s be ing pleaded by people who have
nothing to lose except their first-night
seats 6
‘ The Trust seems t 0 g 0 to some
lengths to ensure that theatrical people
have little say in their own affairs. The
Australian Ballet Company last year
had its own administrator. Now it
shares one with the Trust. The Ballet
Company board has four members
Bruce Scott, administrator of both the
Trust and the Ballet Company, John
McCallum, of J. C. Williamson’s, and
Peggy van Praagh and Robert Help-
mann, the joint artistic directors of
the company. But, lest Miss van Praagh
and Mr. Helpmann should get above
themselves, they have only one vote
between them.
It is in respect to performers that the
Trust has created an unforgivable, in-
defensible position. It is neither ap-
propriate nor pleasant to go into what,
after all, are the private financial
stresses of a section of the community,
which is entitled to the same dignity
in work as the rest. This is not to sug-
gest that any particular player is en-
titled to a steady livelihood (making
this point usually calls forth one of
those perennial, gracious letters-to-the-
editor, “What makes them think that
the world owes them a living?”) but
that they are entitled to some con-
tinuity of growth within their profes-
sion.
F. is impossible to think of a growing,
lively theatre except in relation to
the people in it. Any Council for the
Performing Arts which is set up with-
out a full-scale investigation into the
conditions of work of performers in all
fields would merely perpetuate hap-
hazard standards and any Government
which talks about “doing something' 1
for the arts without “doing something"
for artists can be only frivolous, unreal-
istic, and dishonest.
The idea, put forward by Dr,
Coombs, that the interim committee
which may precede the Council for
the Performing Arts should investigate
“co-operation between live theatre and
public and private television agencies
designed to stimulate the development
of high-quality Australian programs
in their field” merely sounds like an-
other way of shelving the problem,
although it probably was not intended
to be.
“Doing something” for artists at the
present juncture could only be a re-
sumption of the debate in the Senate
on the ill-fated Vincent report. Or if
we can remain patient and optimistic
for long enough it could be a full-
scale, added inquiry into public-
sponsorship of the arts.
Quite as interesting as the history of
the Trust is the history of the develop-
ment of the idea of a Council for the
Performing Arts, at least as recorded in
the daily papers.
In January this year a vice-president
of the Trust, Dr. Darling, at a Citizen-
ship Convention in Canberra suggested
a “£4 million or £5 million cultural
foundation.” Dr. Coombs came back
speedily and said that Australians did
not want “official culture.” “No one
wants to be told what is good or bad
in culture by a central authority,” he
said. Apparently, he thinks they do
want to be told what is good or bad in
culture by an effective central authority
of private citizens.
Nor has the Trust been free from
the thing which most people fear from
“official culture” —censorship of plays
because they do not conform with the

\
JONES. M.Z. (MRS.)
Mrs. Jones buys margarine,
her neighbour buys butter...
Should
Mrs. Jones be
rationed?
If anyone suggested to Mrs. Jones’ neighbour that butter
should be rationed as it was 25 years ago, she’d think the
idea was absurd. Australian butter is in plentiful supply, no
housewife should ever be denied its use. Surely the same is
true of Australian margarine made with Australian vegetable
oils. Why then must the housewife be denied an abundant
supply of Australian margarine? Why is the manufacture and
sale of margarine still under a stringent quota or ration sys
tern imposed 25 years ago?
The Quota System—How it happened
A quarter of a century ago, when the raw material used in
margarine was largely imported, State Governments imposed
heavy quota restrictions on the amount of table margarine
which could be sold. They further restricted cooking mar-
garines, which are not subject to quotas, by allowing only a
minor percentage of vegetable oil to be included in cooking
margarines.
At the time, the Australian Dairy Industry needed all the help
it could get and it seemed logical to ration margarine and so
bolster our own butter industry. Every country has the right
to protect its own primary industry against outside intrusion.
However, that right can hardly extend to protecting one Aus-
tralian primary industry at the expense of another Australian
primary industry. This is largely what has happened.
Has Mrs. Jones the right to decide what she eats?
Mrs. Jones, and every housewife, has always had the right to
choose the family diet and spend the housekeeping budget to
the best of her ability. Last year, the Australian housewife
saved a combined $11,250,000 out of the family budget be-
cause she preferred margarine. Each year public demand for
margarine is increasing, but if the quota system is rigidly
applied, bearing in mind Table Margarine quotas have not
been increased during the last eleven years, about one-third
of the table margarine in the shops will disappear. Con-
sumers will be faced with a shortage, prices could go up and
strict rationing will apply.
The housewife will lose, the manufacturer and employees will
lose and the farmers growing vegetable oilseeds will lose. It
doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense to ration Mrs. Jones.
The quiet revolution
The quiet revolution is the story of a new primary industry as
important to our future as wheat and maize and oats ... it is
the Edible Oilseeds Industry, Safflower Oil, Cottonseed Oil
and Peanut Oil. Three major crops that mean prosperity and
new futures for the man on the land. Margarine is the major
user of these three oils and once freed from the quota sys-
tem the margarine manufacturer can use as much of these
homegrown oils as the Australian farmer can produce. If the
manufacture of wholly Australian margarine remains tied to
the quota system the biggest potential boom in Australian
primary industry could end in a fizzle.
The vision to get going
From the start, the growth and expansion of the Australian
Edible Oilseeds Industry has been forcefully supported by the
vision of one Australian Company—Marrickville Margarine
Pty. Ltd. (a subsidiary of Marrickville Holdings Ltd.). It was
largely they who carved out a major new market, they who
paid for the thousands of hours of research, and it was they
who developed sales that encouraged the farmer to build a
new staple crop. They took the homegrown safflower oil and
they made a new kind of margarine, they called it poly-
unsaturated MIRACLE, a product of such quality it success-
fully competes at the same price as butter. Similarly, new
products and new margarines are being developed from pea-
nut and cotton oil.
All must benefit the Australian housewife, all must benefit the
Australian farmer. The idea of rationing doesn’t seem to make
a lot of sense to Mrs. Jones.

central authority’s idea of its own dig-
nity, or, even, when they are for export,
with the central authority’s idea of our
national “image.”
Then on May 29 the executive direc-
tor of the Trust, Mr. Stefan Haag, on
the TV program “Fighting Words,” as
reported in “The Australian” on June
11, said: “Dr. Badger is really saying
all these things are done very badly by
the Trust and would be done very well
by an Australian Council. I think that
is so much poppycock.”
However, between the time Mr. Haag
appeared on television and the report
appeared, his boss, Dr. Coombs, had
announced that he had seen the Prime
Minister (the change of Prime Minister
may have had something to do with Dr.
Coombs’ change of heart) for pre-
liminary discussion on a Council for
the Performing Arts.
Dr. Coombs has said now that the
range of functions of the Trust has
placed a “great strain on our admini-
strative organisation.” The Trust is,
of course, a very small and simple
organisation compared with large num-
bers of enterprises. Its administrative
responsibilities are slight compared
with those of, say, the Australian Broad-
casting Commission.
COMPARISONS with the ABC are
misleading but inevitable. The
Commission itself consists of something
near to the choir of angels required for
the Council for the Performing Arts,
but even it is not so wedded to
“detachment” as the Trust board.
The ABC amid all its difficulties
obviously has large areas in which
people can work freely, just as the
Trust has not. It has its own power
structure in which people can move
up, down, or even sideways if they wish,
just as the Elizabethan has not. The
general manager of the ABC is obvi-
ously someone to be reckoned with on
any terms (and someone to be reck-
oned with by the Commission) as the
executive director of the Elizabethan
obviously is not.
The ABC is, of course, a statutory
body (those magic words), but there
was no reason why the Elizabethan
could not have changed its status if
possibilities for growth had been appar-
ent within it. Perhaps if someone
within the Elizabethan had fought the
battles Charles Moses fought 30 years
ago to let the Commission know where
it stood and he stood, the Elizabethan
could have grown in strength, but there
are no young Charles Moseses in the
central organisation of the Trust.
This article has been concerned only
with the history and possible future of
the Trust. It has been written after
talking to many people both inside
and outside the organisation and out
of some impressions formed over the
years. Normally most of the remarks
about the Trust would have been at-
tributable, but there are now few
people who will speak about the Trust
for publication.
The other, and more positive, half
of the story would be the future and
composition of any Council for the
Performing Arts. It is doubtful whether
it would be fruitful or sensible to talk
about something which does not exist
(although later may prove too late).
One hopeful aspect is that there is now
a number of people, inside and out-
side the Trust, inside universities and,
even, newspapers, who could offer
reasoned and sympathetic evidence to
any interim committee. Although their
expertise may have grown out of their
frustration with the Trust, it remains
an asset which we did not have when
the Trust was formed.
But although the Trust could now,
somewhat generously, be described as
a fairly efficient starter-motor, which
we could now easily discard, it looks
as if the Trust still wants to go for
the ride. Dr. Coombs talks of
opera and ballet coming under “the
general supervision of the Trust,”
which may be taken by the more per-
sistent critics as a synonym for inter-
ference. More specifically, Dr. Coombs
has expressed confidence in the ability
of the Trust to provide skilled theatri-
cal administration for visiting or tour-
ing companies and to do a public rela-
tions job for the performing arts.
The Elizabethan, to someone like
myself who has visited its head office
at least every couple of months over
the past four or five years, seems an
unhappy place. There are, as Neil
Hutchison once said, large numbers of
intelligent, sensitive people working for
the Trust. However, they tend to
measure their achievement by the
amount of ground they can put between
them and head office.
The Trust appears to have an
efficient administration of the variety
which we all come up against at some
time or another. You employ accoun-
tants at around $lOO a week to see
that no one spends $lO a week on long-
distance phone calls.
Its administrative efficiency is of the
kind, as someone associated with the
Adelaide Festival has pointed out that
several months before the Festival the
Trust could not tell the Festival
whether or not it could put on opera,
whether it could find an orchestra,
what singers were available. It could,
however, without any trouble tell the
Festival how much it would charge
for tickets if it did put on opera. Which,
eventually it did not do, as everyone'
else had known it would not.
The joint artistic director of the Bal-
let Company, Miss Peggy van Praagh,
one of the mildest critics of the Trust,
believes that among its chief failures
is the lack of appreciation of theatrical
administration as a skilled job and not
one for a failed actor who wants to
remain in the theatre somehow, or for
an accountant who is fond of the stage.
Mr. Bruce Scott, the current adminis-
trator, joined the organisation from the
Reserve Bank four years ago, but,
according to Miss van Praagh, he is
‘‘learning fast.” However, if Mr. Scott
is learning, who is teaching him and
who is he going to teach?
The Trust’s public relations, as men-
tioned before, on a day-to-day basis
have often been good. However, on a
policy level the Trust seems to have
had few ideas or few which filter
through to the right people. One would
think it would be many years or more
consistent achievement before the Trust
were considered an acceptable agency
to “sell” theatre to the public.
A more generally acceptable idea
seems to be that the Trust could look
after visiting companies, not brought
here by commercial managements, and,
perhaps, have something to do with
touring companies within Australia.
However, such activities are spasmodic
and may not economically justify a
permanent organisation.
On a more down-to-earth level the
Trust could be a sort of commissariat
for the theatre, maintaining set and cos-
tume workshops. The Trust’s activities
in these fields have benefited all theatre.
Williamson’s could not have put on the
Sutherland season without Trust work-
shops. The Phillip Theatre in Sydney
has acknowledged that it could not have
diversified to the extent it did a couple
of years ago without the Trust work-
shops.
However, whether a body which has
enjoyed leading the band will relish
bringing up in the rear with the sup-
plies remains to be seen.

THE prospect of sitting through an
evening of ,wind chamber music
horrifies many people. This
trepidation is invariably the expression
of a lack of sympathy toward the works
being performed. The various combi-
nations of flute, oboe, clarinet, horn,
and bassoon (often stiffened with the
richer possibilities of the piano) suffer
from an innate tendency to re-
solve themselves late into the textures
of the village band, as this program
showed.

the limitations of their chosen form.
Their concert repertoire is carefully
constructed in a manner which minim-
ises “listener fatigue”—a factor which
can become overpowering after the
first 40 minutes of massed wind reson-
ances. The progression Beethoven/
Nielsen/Rossini/Poulenc provided
enough contrast in style and texture to
make the program as a whole an in-
teresting excursion into the major
works of the form.
Somewhat of a microcosfnic Sydney
Symphony Orchestra, the NSWQ sets
itself demanding standards purely in
terms of the distinguished abilities of
its members. Neville Amadio, David
Wooley, Donald Westlake, and John
Cran have all earned their fine repu-
tations as section leaders in the orches-
tra. Patrick Brislan is among the
younger players in the Symphony’s
brace of horns, and Joyce Hutchinson,
who played in the Beethoven and Pou-
lenc, is its resident pianist. After years
of working together, such a group of
musicians should and did enjoy the
rapport and unity of sound necessary
in any chamber music performance.
Beethoven’s Quintet in E Flat for
Pianoforte, Oboe, Clarinet, Horn, and
Bassoon is an early and unremarkable
work. More an elaborated piano sonata
than a quintet, the piece is long-winded
and unimaginative to the extent of
being dull. Partly through this im-
balance of scoring and partly as an
outcome of Miss Hutchinson’s natural
feelings at being the sole female per-
former of the evening, the piano domin-
ated throughout. Brislan’s slight uncer-
tainty in intonation here was the only
obvious technical lapse of the program.
The wind Quintet Op. 43 by the
Danish composer Carl Nielsen is an-
other work which attempts to impose
on the combination of flute, oboe,
clarinet, horn, and bassoon a flexibility
and dramatic range of which it is simply
not capable. Faced with some rather
thick and muddy passages in the first
and final movements, the players re-
sponded with a brightness and clarity
of tone which made one almost forget
the shortcomings of the music. In the
opening Allegro, Brislan produced a
melodic style both wonderfully rich and
noble. The exchanges between clarinet
and bassoon in the Minuet were deftly
handled and helped to maintain the
movement’s light formal shape.
Modest, elegant, and entertaining,
Rossini’s second Quartet is very much
a flautist’s affair. Neville Amadio was,
as always, the poised and sensitive
master of his part, transforming the
runs and arpeggios into a lyrical flourish
which recalled his performance of the
Mozart Flute Concerto late last year.
Joyce Hutchinson returned for her
second valiant keyboard innings in the
Poulenc Sextet. In its raucous and
vulgar way, this work perhaps best
illustrates the potential of the wind
quintet when a piano is added for per-
cussive effect. Juxtaposing the grotesque
with the humorous and the deceptive
with the banal, Poulenc’s work is en-
joyable because it never asks to be
taken seriously. The style of the group’s
playing loosened considerably in cor-
respondence with the music, promoting
a freshness and bravado rarely heard in
local performances. At ambitious tempi,
especially in the Finale, the contra-
puntal and rhythmic intricacies of the
score were dispatched with impressive
assurance.

ONCE again British TVs master
comedy writers, Galton and Simp-

in outfitting Frankie Howerd with a
role tailored to his particular talents,

Howerd in radio as a man with a set

a mauve one by changing inflections.
It is very unlike the scriptwriters’
previous show, “Steptoe and Son,”
which used its actors in limited sur-
roundings and was largely pitched to-
ward comedy with pathos. This line
would not suit Howerd, whose style
leans to the Dame in panto. For a
beginning, he is being presented in a
sketch between two short monologues.
This allows him to tell the audience
who he is and how he got that way, an
idea I hope will soon be dropped, be-
cause the acted comedy material is so
good.
Last week’s sketch began in a per-
sonnel manager’s office, where Howerd
was applying for a job “between en-
gagements.” It turned out to be one
in a team of gents, dressed to promote
Eagle Brand foods, who called on
homes. They met some strange house-
wives, and finally a team of “public
relations men” dressed as hares.
On Thursday in Sydney, and pre-
sumably soon to follow “Steptoe” in
Melbourne, ABC Television gives us
“The World of Wooster” at 7.30 p.m.,
a period comedy of the ’2os and ’3os
from P. G. Wodehouse’s stories of
Bertie Wooster and his gentleman’s
gentleman, Jeeves. There is no attempt
to update, there is every attempt to use
meticulously accurate sets, and the
wonderfully dotty world of Wodehouse
comes through very well, lacking only-
in certain bite, which was timely in the
author’s observations on the Upper
Classes of pre-war England.
With these two very different, equally
humorous shows, ABC Television is
serving what many think should be its
purpose, wider choice for viewer. It
may also be gaining further ratings
high enough to please Mr. Duckman-
ton, as least in the 7.30 p.m. area.
Recent criticisms have suggested that
the ABC needs some winners to com-
pensate for the alleged total failure
of “Australian Playhouse.” It depends
on viewpoint. I remember some awful
productions from early American tele-
vision, and from Britain.
Viewers suffered, but expertise came
gradually in script and production. The
pity is that Australian TV, and spon-
sors, did not persist with short local
drama over the past ten years. Even
the new channels would rather waste
money on doomed variety shows than
try for drama. I wish the ABC success
in its perserverenee with “Playhouse”
and wish there were more like Pat
Flower, who does not scorn $230 a
script but is using the opportunity to
learn to write for the medium and get
paid for it. On her last effort, “Mar-
leen,” she is beginning to get the half-
hour length. The use of film behind,
and the senseless, but eerie, marching
of the girls up and down the Marching-
Girls’ hall, were an advance in more
ways than one. But I do wish that
someone would write a simple comedy
or two for the series.
FRANK ROBERTS
ON FILM
The Un-Australian Industry
CINESOUND in Sydney, one hears,
is planning to produce a teenage
musical which will star Billy
Thorpe and the Aztecs and will be
made in color for $70,000. The film
was originally to have featured Normie
Rowe; but, apparently as a result of a
failure to make terms with Rowe’s
manager, the casting was changed.
The intention is to recover the cost
purely on the local market and in New
Zealand. Unfortunately, the box-office
results of such films in the past have
not been good. A film starring Johnny
O’Keefe was shot at the Stadium seve-
ral years ago; it ran only a few days
at the Sydney Capitol. American films
produced for the beach generation have
suddenly stopped appearing, and the
studio which made most of them,
American International, has ceased their
production. A Cliff Richard teenage
musical which opened at the new Ascot
Theatre in Sydney was earlier rejected
by Hoyts for distribution in Australia,
and it did not run for long; a recent
inspection of suburban theatres showing
teenage films revealed rows of empty
seats.
One hopes that Cinesound is not
making a major error and that if it
gets a backer he will be satisfied with
his return; he may well be if the film
is superb and the selling to the teen-
agers is inspired.
B UT there are two things to bear
in mind: Such a film -would be
only a support, and it is notorious that
Australians have not for decades
accepted Australians as film stars or
even as major film directors and pro-
ducers and writers until they have been
acknowledged elsewhere.
To overcome this fundamental diffi-
culty which people marketing the
purely indigenous product face would
need, I think, a basic revision of the
whole national psychology. Film-
making involves, essentially, dictator-
ship by a director, who will usually
be terse, not “nice,” and bossy—in
other words, anti-Australian.
And glamorisation: the absolutely
whole-hearted building up of big per-
sonalities and the giving of their heads
to directors, players, and writers. Ava
Gardner remarked while in Melbourne
that Australians could deglamorise an
actress quicker than anybody in the
world, and she is, of course, right. What
is needed is that total commitment to
Australian talent which at once removes
the adjective “local” from that noun
“talent” and makes it feel sufficiently
important.
Once you have built the talented up
in this way and have made the mem-
bers of the crew feel part of a major
enterprise, you start to create the right
atmosphere for film-making and pro-
motion. You encourage egomania-
essential in the film-maker—and you
encourage professionalism and dis-
courage amateurism (Donald Wynne,
an English film director doing com-
mercials here, has pointed out that the
young, untried, and, of course, cheaply
obtained amateur is preferred to the
seasoned professional). This must
stop: you must train and train, and
insist on the highest standards. You
then have to persuade the public that
the people you are pushing, although
Australian, are of international stan-
dard. You then take your picture out
to the world and sell it as a purely
indigenous product.
The financing of this would have to
come at least partly from British and
American sources. The trick is to get
the money without letting them select
both stars (they would have to bring
one and either a director or producer).
This can be got over if they
are offered a split-market deal
whereby they keep Britain and
America and we keep Australia and the
Eastern Hemisphere. This could fur-
ther be aided by an equivalent to the
British Eady plan, which has made film-
making in England so attractive to
American film-makers. The future of
Australian films, therefore, depends
partly on a sudden upsurge of national
pride, and pride in purely Australian
talent unknown elsewhere (pride not
at present in existence), partly on a
firm refusal to follow that mateship
philosophy which is so ruinous to
glamorisation, and partly again on the
obtaining of foreign money on the basis
of a split-market arrangement. And,
above all, on an understanding that a
unit must shelve its Australian feelings
and put its absolute trust in a direc-
tor who may very well be an un-
mitigated swine,
“They’re a Weird Mob,” essentially
a British-Australian co-production (not
an Australian film), is a step in the
right direction; and to his very great
credit Michael Powell has suggested
that Australians should produce the
films and direct them after a couple
of introductory efforts. But this does
not invalidate anything I’ve said
earlier: that we have to believe in our-
selves (and that some of us are better
than others) before we can have that
very un-Australian thing, a film busi-
ness.
• As a footnote to this piece, I should
like to draw the attention of would-be
Australian film-makers who are opposed
to American co-financing of pro-
duction to a letter in a recent “New
Statesman.”
Writing of U.S. investment, Andrew
Filson, Director of the Federation of
British Film-makers, says: “The Ameri-
can contribution to the quality and
world-wide success of British films has
been immense . . . American finance
has promoted not only large-scale films
like ‘Lawrence of Arabia’ and ‘Thunder-
ball’ but also ‘Tom Jones,’ ‘Becket,’
‘The Knack,’ ‘The Girl with Green
Eyes,’ and ‘Alfie.’ ”
CHARLES HIGHAM


BOOKS
Moving Pictures
By JAMES McAULEY
Noonday Country. Charles Higham.
Angus and Robertson. $1.85.
PERHAPS this volume will draw
more serious attention in this
country to Charles Higham’s work,
which is better known and appreciated
abroad. It is a stronger collection than
his last one, more varied and confident.
One can say, as a matter of fact with-
out any value-judgment implied either
way, that it is written in the Inter-
national Style. The Australian settings
in many of the poems are different in
their idiom of vision and expression
from that of our native-born talents,
and one moves to Asian scenes or the
garden of the Villa d’Este without
need of adjustment. Technically I think
he excels any other of the younger poets
in Australia.
Some of the poems, I must admit,
seem to me to be manufactured pieces:
the wish and ability to write seizing
upon a mood or theme. This is a fallible
sort of judgment and may not corres-
pond to other people’s reading; I shall
simply mention two examples that strike
me this way: “Harborscape” and “At
Bronte.”
The International Style has several
characteristics as exhibited here. The
poem usually places one in a particular
situation or scene, presented with some
particularity, often with emphasis on a
casual or accidental detail which is in-
vested with symbolic value or emotional
tone: for example, in “Beach Head,” a
photograph album abandoned on the
sand. (“A sodden album, pictures foul
with time . . .”) Sometimes there is an
action in the poem, more often only a
movement of mind and feeling, appeti-
tive or recoiling, assertive or acquies-
cent. Success is more difficult in the
latter case, when the external elements
function only to give body to inner
mood.
Higham’s poems move by images, are
a texture of images, with some direc-
tional words to steer meaning and
evaluation. The images concentrate the
feeling into themselves. His is a language
of intensification: vivid, thrust into the
quick of sense, often painful or violent
with kinaesthetic effect as well as visual,
enforced by the sound pattern.
There is a threat. There is a threat
in roses.
Flared throats that suck the light.
His technique is cinematic in its
ability to intensify detail:
Black shoe-leather crumpled like
licorice . . .
This kind of language and technique
functions best, as I have said, when it
is not “subjectivity” that rules but an
objective situation which draws the
poet’s sensibility into itself and holds it
there. “Monkey” is a brilliant example.
Of the Nagasaki poems, “The War
Museum” is notable for its control of a
difficult subject.
But the poems I want to draw atten-
tion to especially are those in which the
technique has found its most fitting sub-
ject matter, and these are ones in which
there is a more fully articulated “story”
to give structure and direction. “The
Acrobats” tells of the former achieve-
ment and the pathetic decline of five
performers. “O’Leary” presents a similar
study powerfully realised of an aging
boxer facing the brutal young oppon-
ents. These are studies akin to Toulouse-
Lautrec, the language cruel and the feel-
ing full of pity.
Somewhat akin is “The Kelly Show,”
though pathos is submerged in irony.
The scene is Ned’s taking off, the inter-
est divided, with subtle interplay, be-
tween the performances of Ned and his
sister on that memorable scene:
She simpers. He, thin, graceless, peni-
tent,
Stares at the hood, the buckle, the
cold drop;
His eyelids flutter still a weak dis-
sent;
She starts to think the show will be
a flOp y
And hooks her skirt up to attentive
smiles . . .
Though it is a parlous business to
solicit poets, one hopes that Higham
will develop further the possibilities of
this genre. Belonging to the same group
(as an earlier venture if the poems are
in chronological order) is “Jack the
Ripper,” not as well integrated and
realised, but suffused with the sweet
stench of our sick ambiguous involve-
ment:
With your instruments of healing,
your dark cloak
And face calm as the moon under
the tall black hat.
One poem in the collection seems
different in mode from the others, “The
Call.” It doesn’t move by images so
much as by the flow of discourse and
feeling in a more traditional way, taking
the risks (to my mind worth taking) of
trusting the flow without reinsuring the
performance by imagistic brilliance. It
is the “I remember, I remember” theme,
and closes thus:
Well, it is gone, that dance of inno-
cence,
Those tales of Grimm and Hoffmann
on the knee;
Hours of dream when there was no
pretence,
Lovely and patient, sleeping and
waking free
Of passion, and the tantalus cup of
fears.
A special word should be said about
the book-design. The dust-jacket is excel-
lent, and the case and typography and
printing of good quality. Angus and
Robertson can do it when they try.
A False Endeavour
By M. H. ELLIS
Norman Lindsay’s Ship Models. Photo-
graphed by Quinton F. Davis. Angus
and Robertson. $l2.
THIS was a book worth doing and
worth doing well. In paper, type,
photography, and reproduction it
is magnificent. It contains eight color
plates and 44 black-and-whites, includ-
ing many drawings, rescued from the
debris of Norman Lindsay’s study, of
ships rigging and other details
The jacket front is a fine color photo-
graph of the forward section of Lindsay s
model of the Royal Charles, reproducing
the version in the South Kensington
Museum. The blurb describes the draw-
ing on the back cover as that of a model
of the Ariadne, an “early 19th-century
frigate.” It is, in fact, apparently a
model of the Ariadne, an 18th-century,
24-gun frigate commanded by Captain
Arthur Phillip an unlucky ship. He
ran her on to a sandbank at the mouth
of the Elbe to save her from an ice-
jamb, and she was afterward run down
by the towering Princess Royal while
still under his command. Governor King
was a lieutenant in her for four years.
The selection of vessels includes a
Greek galley, a “Tudor Galleon of
Henry VIII’s time,” an Elizabethan
ship, the Royal Charles, a frigate of
1757, the Royal Caroline, a royal yacht,
an East Indiaman, a naval cutter of
1800, a flush-deck ship of 1830, and the
more modern Thermopylae, and the
Joseph Conrad.
These are introduced by an essay by
Douglas Stewart, who has become a
sort of Boswell-cum-literary fidus
Achates to Mr Lindsa He is
sure that « mo del, whether Greek,
t-t- u
Etabethan, or later, ts an exact replica
of the or « lna ' sh ‘P- Wltl ? sometimes
an extra touch of decoration,
Whlle 1 admire the infinite care, end-
less labor > and artistic devotion which
have gone into the making of the
models, and applaud their artistic merit,
1 certainly do not go along with Mr.
Lindsay in his historical expositions
which accompany his models. A good
deal that he writes is sketchy, and some
absurd.
Mr. Lindsay writes, for instance, that
in making the model of Cook’s
Endeavour, now in the Melbourne Art


Gallery, all he had to go on was the
model of a cat-built boat and a “draw-
ing of the hulk when it (Endeavour) was
derelict.” If that drawing was the one
reproduced in the Historical Records
of N.S.W. it appears to have been a
drawing of the wrong Endeavour.
He adds: “The distinction I can claim
for that model is that I was the first
to insist that the Endeavour was a full-
rigged ship and not a barque. The
claim raised a howl of derision from
every old sailor who saw it, but I was
able to confound them on the evidence
of Cook’s log, which refers to the
handling of the mizzen topsail, which
a barque does not have . . . When the
full plans turned up in later years I
found I had not gone wrong anywhere
in her construction.”
Neither I nor the Mitchell Library
nor anybody else that I know of has
heard of these “full plans.” The only
original plans known are three or four
hull plans which show nothing of the
rigging. And why Mr. Lindsay needed
to turn to the hulk drawing when there
was a perfectly good drawing of the
ship beached at the Endeavour River
mouth (Cooktown) in Hawkesworth’s
first edition of “Cook’s Voyages,” show-
ing her rigging in detail, I do not know.
WHEN Cook’s vessel was commissioned
there was already an Endeavour in
the Royal Navy and, to distinguish the
new acquisition, her type was consistently
described in all relevant documents.
This makes it possible that among the
howls of protest at Mr. Lindsay’s state-
ment that she was not a barque but a
full-rigged ship would be those of the
three Lords of the Admiralty (Towns-
end, Brett, and Spencer) who instructed
(March 21, 1768) the Navy Board that
“the said vessel be registered on the list
of the Royal Navy as a barque by the
name of the Endeavour Lord Hawke,
First Lord of the Admiralty, a most
famous admiral who signed Cook’s com-
mission as commander of “his Majesty’s
bark the Endeavour would also howl in
chorus with Cook himself, who acknowl-
edged his orders and instructions in a
letter addressed from “Deptford,
Endeavour, bark, May 31, 1768.”
Apart from her picture in “Hawkes-
worth,” which shows clearly that she
was a full-rigged ship, all documents
make it clear that she was chosen for
the service largely for that reason
because she needed less crew, thus pro-
viding more room for scientists and
supernumeraries than a full-rigged
vessel.
She was, in truth, a cat-built barque
a ship of Baltic Sea type, constructed
with heavy timbers to withstand heavy
loads and rough seas, broad-bellied to
carry the huge quantities of stores
needed for so long a voyage, of shallow
draught to allow her to frequent shallow
waters when there were no coral reefs
about!
The trouble \vith Mr. Lindsay’s view
is that he confuses the modern “bark
or barque” a vessel with only fore-
and-aft sails on the mizzen mast with
the bark or barque of the 18th century
—a tough, roomy, stout maid-of-all-
work vessel somewhat related to a sea-
going barge and so named irrespective of
her rigging. Endeavour infringed the
modem definition by carrying a square
topsail on her mizzen, but she was still
not a full-rigged ship and she was still
a bark. And the old salts and the ghosts
of 18th-century admirals will, therefore,
continue to howl at Mr. Lindsay.
Yet, this makes him none the less a
genius in his own niche as a painter,
draftsman, and modeller, and, one
might add, having regard to his house
architect. The book is a magnificent
piece of modern Australiana, a credit
alike to artist, photographer, designer,
and publisher even if not to the
marine historian.
Concerning Defeats
Hacking away and gasping steam,
Denting a breast plate here and there,
Sometimes soliciting a thin
Dark fluid from chain-mail with his axe,
The soldier chancing to look up
Sees the red fluttering pennant dragged
From the oppressive sky and knows
The king is dead, and for the first
Time sees the foreign lances gleaming.
I turn the page upon these hordes
Of muddy figures in sick terror
Panicking on a drizzly heath
(Now dodging through the lines of print.)
Such a defeat at least was certain,
But my mind can see other figures,
Men tumbling over men, dazed faces
Fleeing no enemy who murmur
Of kings they never had who died.

Trials by Warfare
By R. M. WILDING
The Emperor of Ice-cream. Brian Moore.
Andre Deutsch. $2.85.
The King Between. David Martin. Cas-
sell. $2.85.
BOTH “The Emperor of Ice-cream”
and “The King Between” are
novels that deal with political
themes, although it would be hard to
say that either is a political novel.
Brian Moore deals with the adolescence
of a boy in Belfast, and World War II
serves as a backdrop to, and a means
of, his growing up. Young Gavin Burke
joins theA&P —4ifoßaid Precautions —
after l&jpP; fail m examina-
tions; Ip idea to for an ex-
ternal exam and the: l&llow his brother
and father to University. But joining
the ARP is in his aunt’s eyes almost
treachery; it means supporting Britain;
and the Catholic, patriotic Irish are
hoping that a German victory in the
war will release them from British
domination and allow Northern Ireland
to be reunited with Eire.
This provides the political theme
and politics here have become identi-
fied with warfare something that
the king in David Martin’s novel is try-
ing to avoid; but something that the
ARP volunteer, signalling to German
bombers in the blackout with a power-
ful torchlight, is quite unworried
about.
Gavin is never as anti-British as
that; indeed the whole political strand
of the novel seems to pass Gavin by.
He becomes friends with Freddie Har-
greaves, an Independent leftist, and
ends up acting in a play put on by a
group of Young Communists; but noth-
ing much is made of this incident in
the novel nor is much made of the
beautiful redhead whose husband hands
her over to Gavin at the local dance

Gavin is sick and the redhead is never
seen in the book again.
There are many of these stray inci-
dents, inconclusive, undramatic, un-
memorable—and the book ultimately
fails because of their unmemorability.
The redhead’s husband is a prominent
local capitalist —yet his inclusion gives
the novel no wider a social perspective;
slobbering over unattractive girls at the
dance hall, he is a caricature figure—
but a caricature with no political or
social purposes impelling him into the
pages.
Nor does he do much more for the
sexual theme; that is there, Gavin
obsessed by guilt, sneaking looks at his
sister’s legs, trying to commit mortal
sin with his girlfriend, watching the
typist in the window of the house next
door. It’s all a bit deja vu “Billy
Liar,” “A Kind of Loving” are a couple
of obvious sources.
The novel is saved, though, by its
humor; in its early sections especially
it does make you laugh aloud at the
witty, colloquial aside or the near-
farcical action the ARP training
group tying tourniquets. And even if
the easy flow of the writing carries you
along so quickly that the actual jokes
or incidents are forgotten, you can still
remember having been amused.
ir JTHE incidents that are memorable
are perhaps a bit corny; stacking the
corpses of the dead killed in the cul-
minating air raid shouldn’t be corny
yet it is; the blurb mentions
Gavin’s “dizzy emergence from the air-
raid’s horror into the manhood he has
been waiting for”— and this making-
a-man-of-you business is unfortunately
the book’s climax; instead of Gavin’s
adolescent rebellion against his father
persisting, he becomes an adult and
Dad becomes one, too. “The new voice
counselled silence. He Took his father’s
hand.” The saving humor has gone
and all that is left is Uplift.
Trying to evoke adolescence as
the tremulous uncertainties of the film
“II Posto” showed—is a difficult busi-
ness; the dangers are of coyness and
thinness and “II Posto” and “The
Emperor of Ice-cream” tended to slide
into both. David Martin’s subject, the
political situation of a small South-
East Asian State, treated comically, is
perhaps equally difficult. Yet Martin
does manage to sustain a level note of
comedy, avoiding farce, comic-opera,
and Conradian racism. His manner is
perhaps derivative of Hitchcock
ordinary people in an exotic setting
with just flashes of the mysterious and
the sinister like the American
Ambassador’s wife being photographed
when kissing a stone lingam in a
temple. She and her husband, the
King of Lhaodia and his French wife
are all immensely civilised ordinary
people; the Chinese Ambassador is a
bit different because he used to be an
academic.
The situation, though, is not ordin-
ary; a road is to be built through the
middle of Lhaodia, and the king has
to have his prostate operated upon.
The Americans and the Chinese are
competing to provide surgeons and
engineers. King Anabol is playing both
ends against the middle, as the Ameri-
can Ambassador puts it, to preserve
neutrality. But a series of minor mis-
haps sets off a chain of diplomatic
incidents resulting in American and
Chinese mobilisation and nearly
World War 111.
A fable for the ’sixties, “The King
Between” gets its interest as much from
the American Ambassador’s designs on
the Queen of Lhaodia as from the
political manoeuvres. Whether light
comedy is the best form for the political
concerns of South-East Asia is at least
arguable; and given Mr. Martin’s politi-
cal interests and involvements, a rather
more serious novel might have been
expected—serious not just in its man-
ner but in its analysis. Unfortunately,
the situation isn’t as funny as “The
King Between” suggests.
But read as an Australian venture
into Ruritania, then “The King Be-
tween” is enjoyable; its humor is not
as rich as “The Hero of Too”—that was
a book to read rather more slowly and
to brood on. “The King Between” does
not share its marvellous absurdities of
incident and character.
It is on readability that the final
emphasis lies for both these novels; in
terms of content both Brian Moore and
David Martin have offered much more;
what they have offered here are two
very professional, very readable, very
workmanlike products. Yet their
achievement may in some ways be
heralding the death of the novel—
because it is an achievement of some-
thing that TV and cinema can manage
so much more readily.
Breakdown
“Of course, all life is a process of break-
ing down.”
Thus Scoy Fitzgerald, the digestive
dark
Having near swallowed him, the flashing
pain-
Points of light showing no way through
the park
He fell asleep in, dreaming of wonder-
land.
Waking, you may struggle to under-
stand
Whether the fountains that played you
to sleep
Were real or another trick of the retina.
Self-willed sedation. Waking will keep
So few of the promises that put you
under.
And she, walking away now, trailing
Faintly a haze of armpits as she leaves
(Or is it the scent of death her fail-
ing
Or my own?) forecasts the end of love
With too much said, or too much left
unsaid
To structure dreams on. The house is
dead
With its own wakefulness; the fountain-
play
Is the noise of children that has stoned
Us into silence. Upon such reefs we
die
Marooned, know we are real, and alone.

IT is not often that one comes across
a first book of poems of the quality
of Seamus Heaney’s “Death of a
Naturalist,” a book at once remarkable
for its tenderness and realism and the
unforced acceptance quality of its
moods.
What is unusual about “Death of a
Naturalist” is the marvellous maturity
of the author and the way that his
poems fully reflect and organise his
lived experience. There is no fake
here of any sort, either technical or
emotional, but a moving sincerity con-
sistent with experience. The shape of
the poem is the lived weight of the ex-
perience. There is no gap between
what is being said and the way it is
being said.
Mr. Heaney grew up on a farm ip
Derry and the subjects of his poems
cover a range from blackberry-picking,
potato digging, butter making, to views
of his father ploughing; the memory
of the death of a younger brother; child-
hood experiences associated with the
fear of rats (the subject of a particularly
brilliant poem, this, and a fear which
is implicit in other poems) and observa-
tions of animals and plants turkeys,
a cow in calf and a trout (described
as “A volley of cold blood, ram-rodding
the current”). Mr. Heaney writes with
great intensity and control about the
earth, about poor women in church,
about a flight in a plane, and playnig
records to schoolchildren. He has the
born poet’s instinctive gift with images.
One can say of Mr. Heaney what
he himself partly says of Saint Francis:
that his argument is true, his tone right.
“Gravities’’ begins
High-riding kites appear to range quite
freely
Though reined by strings, strict and
invisible.
The pigeon that deserts you suddenly
Is heading home, instinctively faithful.
And most of these poems are marked
by a gravity of tone and gravity of
rhythm as well. “Cow in Calf” ends
“Windbags,/ of bagpipes are crammed
there/ to drone in her lowing./ Her cud
and her milk, her heats and her calves/
keep coming and going.” The rhythm
of the poem itself suggests the slow
labored movement of the cow and
at the same time its heavy control.
Touches like this occur throughout the
whole book and show that one is in
the presence of a real poet, not a
technocrat or versifier.
As one might expect, the virtues of
David Martin’s verse are prose virtues
—directness and clarity of utterance,
the ability to make a simple point
simply; and these are virtues not to be
despised if one believes as I do in the
importance of uninflated language.
Two of Mr. Martin’s best poems,
“Dreams in German” and “Letter to
a Friend in Israel,” have a pleasantly
conversational tone. Narrative and
descriptive qualities are visible in “Out
of Charity” and the first part of “The
Captain,” while “Post Finem Mundi,”
possibly Mr. Martin’s most substantial
piece, has a felt reflective strength:
But if Mr. Martin is not afraid
of simplicity, he sometimes seems
indifferent to what distinguishes it from
banality. A poem like “The Bird” is
somewhat pedestrian while “Unfettered
Thought” is merely chopped-up prose.
Mr. Martin has been rightly admired
for his mastery of English but the
fact that English is not his mother
tongue may help to account for the
insecure sense of rhythm in some poems
and the metrical ineptitudes in others
(e.g., “Where even Ajax feared to
tread;/ which was why he had been
included”). It does not account for the
metaphorical thinness of his verse,
which persists in spite of remarkable
lines like: “Is there a rose that does
not love its leaf?” and “Free on its
hinges turns the gate of grief.”
rpHE portrait poem has always been
popular in Australian poetry from
Kenneth Slessor on and has engaged the
interest of a great number of our con-
temporary writers. Mr. Thiele’s latest
book “In Charcoal and Conte” is a col-
lection of portraits covering a fairly
wide range of Australian types from a
car salesman to a university professor,
with backgrounds stretching through
suburbia to the outback. Mr. Thiele is
at his best when he is sharply ironic
and he can be more wittily detached
about his city types than about some
of his outback figures: he can be a
rather hefty poetic backslapper in
their presence, and, in fact, some of
his “portraits” of them are really
grotesques and caricatures. Others like
that of “Bert Schultz” (a poem slightly
reminiscent in tone of Ray Mathews’
sketches) and the pictures of school-
boys combine exaggeration and affection
in their awareness of “the variousness of
man’s condition.” I like Mr. Thiele
best in looser, more relaxed forms like
“Trampolining Fat Boy” and the other
titles mentioned.
Sir Osbert Sitwell’s trilogy “Poems
About People” or “England Reclaimed"
makes an interesting comparison with
Mr. Thiele’s series of portraits. Sir
Osbert’s long trilogy is divided into
three sections: Book I, “England
Reclaimed,” consists of a series of
sketches of country people and includes
the well-known anthology pieces about
Mr. and Mrs. Hague; Book 11, “Wrack
at Tidesend,” is devoted to those who
live in watering-places; while Book 111
deals with English expatriates and par-
ticularly to those who live in Italy. Sir
Osbert has at his command a con-
siderable range and delicacy of image,
as when he says of Mr. Algernon
Braithwaite, “In conversation, he ex-
panded/ like Japanese toy flowers in
a tumbler of water,” and he has a
sharper eye for nuances of behaviour
and of character than Mr. Thiele.
Some of Sir Osbert’s characters are
drawn with horrifying savagery
especially his “Frieze of Vestry Vir-
gins” with its cruel picture of ‘Tim’
Doribell the tomboy one of Canon
Doribell’s five daughters. But the real
strength of Sir Osbert’s book is the
way it depicts a world in decline. It
is almost a novel in verse.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A Sad Relapse
THE latest British economic measures are very sad indeed.
They mark the final relapse of the Labor Government
into conservatism. Mr. Wilson’s promises to put Britain
on the rfiove have finally been buried in a fierce heap of
restrictions. There are the conservative restrictions of
financial orthodoxy, higher taxes and cuts in Government
spending, and also the restrictions of puritan socialism, the
controls on prices, wages, dividends, buildings, hire-purchase
investment. And the icy voice of Winston Wilson talks of
Dunkirk. What does all this achieve?
There can be little doubt that they will take the pressure
off sterling and give it a much longer period of relief than
it has had for many years. The speculators now have no
reason whatsoever to expect devaluation. And the measures
will no doubt have a salutary effect on the British balance
of payments. Industrial production is bound to sag under
the weight of restrictions and with it the volume of imports
of raw materials. Consumers hit by taxation may economise
a little on food and so cut the nation’s import bill. Certain
forms of Government and private spending overseas are
pruned down directly by new instruments of restriction.
And there may be room in the economy for producing more
for export, helping with the other side of the ledger.
But that is about all that can possibly be found in support
of the measures. Together with the selective employment
tax, which comes into operation in September, the latest
batch of controls add up to an immense deflationary bash at
the economy. Industrial production, already virtually stag-
nant, will drop and the level of unemployment rise rapidly.
The National Plan, that complex program to modernise and
restructure British industry, can be forgotten, as hardships
and sacrifices take the place of the determined move for-
ward.
There may, even in the short term, be disappointingly
small improvement to the British payments situation. On
the one hand, exports often require a buoyant home market
so that economies of full-scale operation can be reaped and
competitive pricing achieved. So many exports do not re-
spond to the wet-blanket technique. On the other hand, if
it is found possible to boost exports, there is bound to be a
certain offsetting effect through the volume of raw materials
imports which these require. So it is unlikely, whatever
happens, that there will be large gains on both sides of the
international payments accounts.
The really disappointing prospects lie in the medium term,
in the three-to-five-year perspective. For whatever may be
gained in the short term may be lost in this period. Wilson
has jettisoned the better part of his complex of schemes to
modernise the British economy. With the recession which
is certain to develop out of these restrictions, investment in
plant and equipment is certain to slump heavily. In that
way the main means to higher productivity will be blocked.
Unemployment will greatly strengthen the hand of old-
fashioned, depression-minded thinkers in the trade unions;
costly make-work practices will be fostered, and resistance to
the incomes policy and to progressive schemes to do away
with redundant workers increased. How ever much it may
make Conservatives feel warm inside, the belt-tightening,
teeth-gritting exercises have no lasting benefits.
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the “Brits” could
have found a less costly method of tackling their imme-
diate payments problems. It might have been better for them
to have made the import surcharge permanent and to have
instituted strict exchange controls over capital movements.
MEN AND MATTERS
FOR some years now there has been
a sense of inevitability about the
departure of Cottees and Thomas
Nationwide Transport from the public
share lists.
This was not because Ken Thomas or
Harold Cottee wanted to sell out. They
were simply caught in a situation from
which there was really no escape. But
they are going to their financial Valhalla
with widely differing feelings. Harold
Cottee is clearly reluctant to let his
Australian company become an Ameri-
can subsidiary; Ken Thomas seems to
reckon that sooner or later something
had to give, anyway.
A belief in not being too greedy
guides the behaviour of Mr. Ken W.
Thomas, founder, chairman, and
managing director of Thomas Nation-
wide Transport Ltd., the truckie with
the s2om. annual turnover.
An urge to “have a go” has trans-
ported Ken Thomas from a one-truck
business in 1946 to a company with
500 trucks and 75 executive cars.
“When you start with next to nothing
and you win for a while, you have the
choice to guard what you’ve got or play
with the bookies’ money,” said Mr.
Thomas. He chose the latter. He decided
to make it a profit-sharing organisation
from the start; in 1951 he loaned two
senior men, GeofT
Hammond and
Ken Smith,
money to buy a
one-third share in
the business,
which they ran as
a triumvirate for
nine years. Later,
other senior stall
were invited is
and, in 1961, the
public, too.
A wartime spell with the Depart-
ment of Labor and National Service
helped Ken Thomas “get his priorities
right” and gave him an appreciation
of union attitudes.
THE exotic passionfruit, native to
Brazil, where it was discovered by
Jesuit priests, was the basis of
Cottee’s success. The late Mr. S. M.
Cottee, father of the joint managing
directors of Cottee’s Ltd., Harold and
Ernest Cottee, was a pioneer of the
N.S.W. north coast. There the passion-
fruit grew wild, and as early as 1906
Mr. Cottee cultivated it on his Lismore
property.
He experimented with it, evolving the
Passiona process for converting it to
soft drink. The Passiona. trade mark
and process was the most valuable
Ken Thomas
Lois Cottee
Harold Cottee
asset when Cottee’s Passiona Ltd.
was registered in 1927.
It started as a cottage industry in
Waverley when Harold, a North Coast
farmer, was persuaded by his city-bred
wife, Lois (they married in 1924), that
there was a future in commercialising
the passionfruit (and her father-in-
law’s processes) on a big scale in the
city.
Since public listing in 1952, Cottee’s,
under the chairmanship of ' Harold
Cottee, has grown into a profitable food
business, with net assets of $4.6m., that
have attracted the takeover attention of
General Foods Corporation.
But passionfruit remains the specialty,
and Harold Cottee’s son Kenneth is
currently a project manager introduc-
ing passionfruit to England, while
Harold, jun., is managing director of
Passiona Bottling Co. (Sydney) Ltd.


In any case, it looks as if we in Australia will soon see the
end of Britain as a source of capital. And we can expect
her Army to be increasingly a mercenary force—going to
Germany, where the locals will pay hard cash for a “British
presence.”
Margarine Quotas
PREDICTABLY the Privy Council refused Marrickville
Margarine leave to appeal against its prosecution for
producing outside State Government quotas. And so
a long legal battle is over. Marrickville’s production licence
is not being renewed for the time being and it is certain
to be compelled to reduce its output from the 10,000 tons of
recent times to the 2166 tons its quota permits. It is
impossible to believe that after all this protracted and costly
legal warfare the Government could do anything else. For
Marrickville’s competitors have been paying heavily by
adhering to the law and forgoing the profits that might
have been gained by following the rebel’s lead.
And yet, as Mr. Crebbin says, the enforcement of the
quota will create a problem of supply. The market has
adjusted itself to absorbing quantities of margarine well in
excess of the total quota allowance. If this is rigidly enforced,
there is a likelihood of shortages, price rises, and even
rationing once Marrickville’s stocks have been run down.
The problem is now a political one.
It is clear that the quotas will have to be increased
and the difficult question is how. One way might be simply
to auction the quotas, as Peter Samuel suggests in his article
on the subject (see page 66).
It is probably too much to expect that the quotas will be
quickly abolished. But the Ministers should ask themselves
whether the system of controls is really worth while. It has
caused immense trouble and expense and tied up top poli-
ticians, lawyers, executives, and advertising men month after
month. Surely we must start thinking about ways of help-
ing the dairy farmers stand on their own feet and meet the
margarine manufacturers without recourse to the protection
of quota limits.
The weight of evidence is clearly against maintaining
quotas, and the well-publicised letter last weekend from an
impressive list of nine leading Australian economists (mostly
specialising in agricultural economics) underlines the point
that not only are there no sound economic arguments to
justify quotas but that social problems in the dairy industry
should be treated by less offensive means, particularly as
margarine quotas are at the expense of low-income con-
sumers.
The Market's Judgment
THE guts of the stockmarket is in company profits. Prob-
lems about foreign investment, interest rates, de-
valuation, and all the rest do not in the main move the
market because of their own significance; their major impact
is that they reflect a situation that affects company profits
—and it is expectations on company profits that have the
main impact on the stock market.
The real reason for the market’s hesitancy for most of
this year, then, is now being clearly demonstrated. Look
at the major company results coming out. Certainly there
are plenty of good profits, but for the most influential and
significant companies there has clearly been no reason to
cheer. BHP’s profit is down (for the simple reason that
local steel demand was disappointing) and so is CSR’s
—and that is a powerful double. But then add the news of
lower earning rates from APM, Minster, Rothmans, Pres-
tige, William Adams, and lower mining returns from the
Barriers, and a sensible basis for market caution emerges.
But while balance sheet analysts live in the past, the stock-
market lives in the future. The market is now wondering
how well companies will do this year and next rather than
in 1965-66. And the prospects are that 1966-67 ought to be
a better year for the stock market.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy: Australia’s international re-
serves added $20.7m to reach $1375.0m at the close of
the 1965-66 year, after the previous year’s $317.8m
decline . . . Heavy industry mostly lifted output in
1965-66, but production was significantly down among
motor vehicles, appliances, and textiles . . . The value
of rural production dropped back from $3439.8m to
$3201m.
Registered unemployed went up by 2500 to 59,000
in June, while job vacancies fell by 3500 to 32,000 . . .
June trading bank advances hit a peak $2845m with a
rise of $26.5m; deposits were $17.5m lower at $4992.8m
(they rose by $ 10.2 m in June, 1965).
For the markets: A mild unease has penetrated
Australian share markets, perhaps partly overseas-
inspired. Leaders react variably and the hitherto strong
base metals are more nervous. Oils have grown a
trifle bolder.
Industrials naturally continued their losses in London,
although these were generally smaller than in the pre-
vious week. The list gave an impression of holding
at the close . . . Wall Street is managing a highly
selective advance where blue chips move very narrowly.
For companies: In a “barebones” preliminary
statement, BHP had to announce a 6 percent profit
drop for its year to May 31; group earnings totalled
$36,009,000, following 1964-65’s record $38,520,000,
after lower tax and (surprisingly) reduced depreciation;
appropriations for mining plant and development have
also been cut back.
A slower second half did not prevent Australian
Paper Manufacturers from attaining a peak $7,241,651
profit (representing a 14.2 percent gain) and raising
dividend from 8f to 9 percent . . . Considerably lower
tax could not help carpet maker Minster avoid a 23
percent profit retreat to $1,444,370, but the 20 percent
dividend is still healthily covered.
An aluminium smelter, capacity 40,000 tons of
primary metal a year, is to be built by Australuco at
Kurri Kurri (N.S.W.) . . . Lower lead and zinc prices
dragged back North Broken Hill’s mining revenue by
13 percent, yet profit from mining and investments
will equal the forecast $7,456,000 . . . Broken Hill South
has reduced ore production from 278,700 tons to
234,000 tons and worked lower lead-zinc grades.
Higher metal prices gave Rutile and Zircon Mines
(Newcastle) a 290 percent profit leap to $610,078 . . .
Its half-owner Peko-Wallsend shows greater gold and
coal output, but silver and copper are down.
Northern Queensland’s Haughton Sugar managed to
turn a $99,660 loss into a $91,816 profit in 1965-66 but
will again pass its dividend . . . Lacking an international
agreement the sugar situation is serious. CSR’s chairman,
Mr. J. W. Dunlop, told shareholders; he also men-
tioned he would “resist to the utmost” any move to
obtain a break-down of the company’s assets and profits.
Chain-store retailer G. J. Coles came out with only a
$17,124 profit increase, to $8,267,354, in the year to June
25, after “difficult” trading; an 11 percent dividend
is held for the eighth successive year . . . Merchant
Permewan Wright needs more funds for expansion and
will get them by a one-for-five issue at 60 percent pre-
mium.
The Reserve Bank approves General Foods desire to
take over Cottee’s, which will now receive a cash offer
of $4.50 a 50 cent share . . . No bank approval has been
given for Thomas Nationwide Transport’s offer from the
U.K. Transport Development Group.
First of the financiers to disclose June 30 earnings,
Associated Securites, lifted profit nine percent to a top
$1,533,630, exhibiting slower growth as evidenced by
outstandings.


J. C. HORSFALL'S MELBOURNE
Hold Back the Yankee Hordes!
IS this the kiss of death? The
thought was prompted by a recent
speech by American willy-willy
George S. Moore, president of the
First National City Bank of New
York, at a businessman’s lunch at the
Southern Cross when he told us his
bank had embraced us and would be
here until death do us part.
I’ve been much in favor of getting
American capital here, because I think
it’s the only sure way of developing
the immense economic resources of this
country and so fulfilling our inter-
national responsibilities as their pos-
sessors. But underlying the whole
exercise of importing capital, or so it
seems to me, is to keep this country
Australian, not to lose our identity, and
this, one would have thought, is a
matter still in our own hands. The
last thing we want is a bunch of Ameri-
can business stormtroopers here bent on
whipping us into their own shape. So
I couldn’t cheer with the rest of the
Southern Cross luncheon party when
Moore said he was whistling up a
horde of his boys from the States to
give us the slide-rule treatment.
In our circumstances it is right to
be both Australian and internationalist,
but one can be other things also. For
instance, I cannot see the virtue in
econo,mic pace, as some people seem
to, simply for its own sake. There are
people who won’t have a lukewarm
economy at any price and always want
resources stretched to the utmost, as if
not to have it that way even when a
breathing space is called for is a crime.
The American brand of pace is more
anathema to me than most. Americans
like Mr. Moore, who want to cut our
economic corners for us, are very hard
to take. In my experience the net
result of forcing the economic pace
their way is a regression in the real
standard of living.
let us take guard. We don’t want
to choke off American interest in us.
But we must keep it in its place. For
one thing, there’s an awful tendency
around just now to sell Britain short
while the American invaders oversell
themselves to us. True, to a lot of
people, and not only European
migrants either, British influence here
has been played out, though how they
arrive at this conclusion quite defeats
me. Even in the material sense, which
perhaps has less relevance to the
answer than a lot of others, British
influence here is still mighty strong.
To sell it short is, in my view', a
mockery.
What I like about this influence just
now is that it’s such a powerful anti-
dote to the Mr. Moores of this world.
While they grab at us we should be
bending our backs to preserve it, not,
as has become a popular line in an
attempt to inflate the Australian
imagination, to rationalise it out of
existence and drive us, economically
anyway, further than we need into the
American camp, where econo,mic altru-
ism has been invented for the salva-
tion of the world. Anyway, we don’t
have to offer hostages to the Ameri-
cans. They have done their homework
on Australia’s economic potential and
see it as the biggest prize offering in
the world since their own discovery by
Columbus.
One thing the British never try to
do is to butter us up. Thank good-
ness for that. Their usual form is
rather to treat us on sufferance, which
is a bit irritating, I’ll admit, but much
better than the sort of thing we heard
in Melbourne last week from an Ameri-
can, Dr. J. A. Turner, consultant to
the Bechtel Corporation, one of the
biggest international engineering groups
operating here. He declared that “the
Australian manager is much more
aggressive, outgoing, and dynamic than
his European counterpart.” It was
a backhanded sort of compliment any-
way. One notices he wasn’t comparing
bosses here with their counterparts in
the United States.
Bechtel Corporation has only been in
Australia since 1960, but its list of con-
tracts is as long and important as your
arm. So doubtless it suffers us gladly.
It has also learnt something of the
Australian boss’ approach to living on
the job; but Dr. Turner put this a
bit blandly when he said, “The Aus-
tralian manager does not want to know
how to drive his troops, only how to
get them to co-operate better; he was
not asking how he can manipulate his
people but how he can help more;
this results in dynamic leadership.”
Well, well.
If this sort of analysis is better left
to ourselves, there is still a lot we can
learn from the likes of Mr. Moore and
Dr. Turner so long as they don’t
breathe too hard down our necks.
PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
Background for a Budget
MRS. McMAHON didn’t see much
of her husband this week as
Cabinet struggled painfully
through its Budget preparations. (The
Treasurer snatched meals between
three-daily sessions.) But security was
good and nothing much emerged, ex-
cept unsurprising hints that defence
spending would be up more steeply
than ever. There is no doubt it will
be w'ay above the sB42m scheduled in
the three - year defence program
announced just 20 months ago. There
is talk of it reaching the billion dollar
mark this year. That would be a s2som
increase.
The week’s statistics provided just a
little more backing for arguments that
the economy can do with a boost from
the Budget. June figures from the De-
partment of Labor showed unemploy-
ment tending to rise again after the
steadying tendency early in the year.
Adult males registered for work at
Commomvealth employment offices
were about 26,000 last month, well up
on the 16,000 trend revealed by sea-
sonal adjustment for the first three-
quarters of 1965. More pointedly, the
last two months have suggested a rising
curve.
June is always a slack month for the
motor industry, but sales this year were
unusually poor. The month’s figures
suggested an annual rate of 380,000,
which is down on recent recovery levels
of 390,000 and over.
But there is virtually no support here
for any action to boost car sales and
a cut in the tax is most unlikely. A
widely held view is that sales are low
now mainly because, in 1964 and early
1965, the industry got ahead of itself,
selling above every reasonable estimate
of the long-term trend. And, anyway,
the skilled resources which the indus-
try uses can probably be better used
elsewhere in the economy for the
moment.
AT the Economics Society, Profes-
sor Kindleberger, of the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology,
spoke brightly on the “multinational
corporation.” Just as the chainstores
run by big national firms had brought
benefits through their competition with
the ma-and-pa cornerstore, so, he said,
international firms had much to give
through making available their peculiar
qualities. They were often far more
efficient in allocating resources than
small firms buying and selling from
one another.
Professor Kindleberger sees multi-
national corporations developing their
own international division of labor —
taking their executives from wherever
they can get the most astute managers,
scattering the various phases of their
production process so as to minimise
costs, and, of course, locating their
accounting departments in Scotland.
Discussion centred on his argu-
ments for freedom of capital flows.
He admitted that there was an argu-
ment against foreign capital where it
created monopoly, but more often than
not it broke up a local monopoly and,
indeed, this was a major source of
opposition to foreign investment.
He said, all the same, there were
problems of monopoly and of pricing
policies designed to avoid local com-
pany taxation, and these did call for
government regulation. What was
needed was an intergovernmental
approach to the problems.


A Rich Store of Wisdom
Sir Alex Fitzgerald, doyen accountant
By CROESUS
SIR ALEXANDER FITZGERALD has been such an active public figure these
many years and is still so sprightly in mind and body it is difficult to imagine
him going into retirement except, say, with half-a-dozen or more directorships
to keep him company.
In fact, when I
called on him last
week to pick up
some crumbs of
wisdom and learn
a bit more about
his plans now he’s
retired from the
accountancy firm
he started in Mel-
bourne 50 years
ago, he admitted
to me that he
looks awfully like becoming a “pro-
fessional” director and, being 75 last
October, not quite the vintage to please
the palate of everybody at the RACV
these days.
Cicero apparently only started to
learn Greek as an octogenarian, so Sir
Alex is not worrying about the age tag.
Nor is the idea of being a professional
anathema to him. Opening out on the
whole subject of directors, he came out
firmly on the side of directors who can
bring worldly business acumen to board
tables, rather than those who are
specialists in the particular line of busi-
ness involved. He sees the directorship
function as cleanly divorced from man-
agement and prefers to have general
managers rather than managing direc-
tors as chief executives of companies.
A board certainly needs people with
financial expertise, and this wasn’t in
all that ready supply. What about
brokers being on boards? Sir Alex was
against this in principle. But, like
brokers being underwriters, which he
also didn’t like, it was largely a ques-
tion of the availability of suitable
people. Director material was not so
abundant in Australia, but quality is
improving. The Institute of Directors,
in which Sir Alex has been a leading
light from the beginning, is helping.
ir pHIS wasn’t the time or place to ask
Sir Alex what he thought of accoun-
ants as directors, though it is a good
question. However, he did say that it
was his prowess as an accountant which
probably got him into so many board-
rooms and also on the numerous offi-
cial commissions and inquiries in which
he has participated over his distin-
guished career as a servant of the pub-
lic (in distinction, that is, to public
servant). I expect he was being rather
modest about this, because one would
have thought his general financial ex-
perience pretty well unrivalled in Aus-
tralia. He had his foot in so many
camps, from the State Electricity Com-
mission and Commonwealth Grants
Commission, say, which he was on for
15 years, as well as being chairman of
the Australian Institute of Manage-
ment, of which he was president, and
the Alcoholic Federation.
Sir Alex sees an indefinitely pro-
longed life for the Grants Commission,
because he cannot see either Western
Australia or Tasmania getting sufficient
population in the foreseeable future to
enable them to follow South Australia
out of the ranks of claimant States. On
the other hand, he thinks there is a
huge potential in Western Australia for
an increase in population in the south-
west, where he considers it could carry
the same population as Victoria. Like
myself, he cannot envisage big popula-
tion expansion in the north-west of
that State.
The word “professional” has no
sting for Sir Alex. When we got round
to talking about accountants he was at
pains to tell me his firm had preferred
not to grow to the point where pro-
fessional personal attention couldn’t be
afforded all clients by the partners.
There was a contrast in this, he said,
with some of the bigger firms in Aus-
tralia with strong overseas connections,
in which clients were lucky if they ever
saw a partner (I’ve heard similar
stories about some of the big share-
broking firms in this country).
A natural question for the former
(and first) professor of accountancy in
Australia was how accounting practice
here measured up to that overseas.
After all, accountants and auditors here
have been much under fire from time
to time, especially in recent years in
connection with company failures. The
fact is that we are no better and no
worse, he mused. We have kept abreast
of overseas developments, he said, and
in fact he has played a big part in this.
The troubles of the accounting pro-
fession were real enough and ever
under discussion within the profession
itself. The main one was, it seemed,
pretty fundamental; what were the
principles of accounting. Sir Alex was
inclined to think there are none, only
accounting standards.
These standards had greatly im-
proved, but Sir Alex stuck firmly to
his well-known view that recent amend-
ments to the Companies Acts hadn’t
improved matters much. On this he
expounded to me his familiar lack of
faith in balance sheets as a guide to the
financial position of companies and said
we would eventually have to substitute
some other criteria for balance-sheet
values (which he maintains mean noth-
ing). He saw a lot of promise in making
cash flows, present and prospective, the
main criterion. This is familiar practice
in the United States.
He is equally critical of the new
provisions in the Victorian Companies
Act requiring borrowing corporations to
make more frequent reports both to
trustees and the Companies Registrar,
holding strongly to his view that in most
cases such reports give a distorted pic-
ture of the position of companies. I
gathered he abhors the effect of the
more frequent reporting on stock ex-
change prices, which he says are there-
by falsified, while the cost to companies
is an unnecessary expense (however
much more work this gives account-
ants). Asked about the present ade-
quacy of annual reports, Sir Alex said
that most were highly informative, re-
flecting improvements over the years.
FINAL question on the unit trust
movement brought forth a firm dec-
laration of faith in the movement,
though not a denial that all its gim-
micks passed muster. One understood
from him, a director of Australian Fixed
Trusts, that it has recently been picking
up some of the ground lost earlier in
the year and had a big future both as
a contributor to national savings (abso-
lutely vital for the development of the
economy, he said) and as a medium of
small personal savings, those with small
capital to participate in development
and still keep access to liquidity.
Sir Alex is one of the best watchdogs
we have in the company arena, in which
he will continue to take a lively inter-
est, perhaps an even livelier one now
he has given up his professional ac-
counting practice. One thing is certain.
His rather advanced age is not going
to stop him, because he looks fitter and
is certainly more “on the job” than
most people half his age.

Price Rise Helps Tobaccos
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
A LEADING stockbroker’s re-
search department has calcu-
lated that the one-cent rise in
the price of cigarettes will add $lO mil-
lion to the industry’s revenue in the
current financial year. It believes this
makes British Tobacco, Philip Morris,
and Rothmans all worth buying, but
for different reasons and despite the
latter’s profit dip in 1965-66. Gener-
ally, each of the companies will benefit
significantly from the price rise, par-
ticularly as the withdrawal of quantity
rebates to retailers accompanying the
rise signifies the beginning of the end
of the price war which has affected
operations for some time now.
A fair slice of the price rise will go
to cover the increased cost of tobacco
leaf following the shutdown of Rhode-
sian supplies. This forced the manu-
facturers to buy elsewhere at higher
prices. Although some of the rise will
go to retailers and wholesalers, there
should be enough of the $lO million
left over to add significantly to the
three profits in 1966-67.
Provided its brands keep up their
sales, Philip Morris seems the best buy
for those seeking quick profits. The
chances of a dividend lift or a bonus
issue, already bright, have been further
enhanced. The company’s growth over
the past few years has been remark-
able, with earning rate climbing from
15.8 to 41.8 percent between 1961-62
and 1964-65. Profits were 40 percent
higher in the last December six months.
Rothmans is more a share for those
seeking income rather than rapid rises,
although now that it has released, at
astonishing expense, a cheaper-priced
cigarette in an attempt to recapture
some of its lost market share, it also
is not without some growth prospects.
Unless Grenadiers are a flop, and with
such a high yield (and a dividend
which remains handsomely covered by
profits), market prices should be at
least held fairly steady.
For British Tobacco, the cigarette
price rise adds another facet to the
company’s current reputation as a
growth stock. This has mainly derived
from its mostly successful diversifica-
tion program.
With pastoral conditions improving
and with the world’s demand for beef
on a clearly upward trend, British
Tobacco’s grazing operations (which
are mainly cattle and which are likely
to be further increased) should become
more significant in the future. This
diversification gives the company a
high safety factor. For it still takes a
game investor to buy tobacco shares;
cigarettes and sickness will probably
one day be linked too closely even for
the stockmarket.
FOR those keen to get into the
takeover-prone transport in-
dustries, there may be some merit
in a Melbourne parcel of Transwest
Haulage shares, now available around
prices of 73 cents. They are yielding
just below 7 percent from the 10 per-
cent basic dividend established last year.
However, some circles believe last
year’s total of 12J percent (this in-
cluded a bonus 2j percent from capital
profits) will be held for the latest year.
If so, the yield on current prices
would be around 8.5 percent, providing
an even more enticing income and wider
scope for a rise in market prices.
The 1964-65 profit, excluding capital
profits, equalled 15.2 percent on par-
ticipating capital and 12.5 percent on
total capital. Profits were up 25 per-
cent in the last December half and,
at last report, the trend was continuing
into the .June half.
Quite apart from this, there has been
a change in the company’s position as
earning power has been boosted by sub-
stantial recent additions to the fleet.
Moreover, the group has been benefiting
from new road laws, which have enabled
increased payloads and profits.
ONCE tarred with a speculative
brush, Oil Drilling and Explora-
tion Ltd. is rightly claiming more
and more investment attention from
those who limit their activities to re-
spectable industrial shares.
The impressive growth record of the
past is reported to be continuing, and
directors have already predicted a lift
in the dividend for the current year,
barring any unforeseen mishaps. The
$3 million spent on capital equipment
in 1964-65 is starting to make its
impact felt on earnings.
The 40 percent interest taken out in
the recently formed ODE-Zapata Pty.
Ltd. has eliminated any local-boy image
the group may have projected to over-
seas oil seekers and they are the big
spenders in the search for oil these
days. Zapata is a leading driller in
the U.S. and the link-up cannot help
but bring substantial benefits ODE’s
way. The new company has already
won a contract from the Woodside
consortium to drill on its behalf off
the Gippsland coast, about 20 miles
from the Esso-BHP strikes.
No doubt it will share in other off-
shore projects inspired by Esso-BHP’s
success. The 35-cent shares yield more
than 5 percent from the soon-to-be-
increased dividend. They seem safe
enough and offer prospects of capital
growth, especially if Woodside strikes
it lucky in Bass Strait.
A GOOD deal has been said lately
about the favorable odds, on his-
torical grounds, of profiting
from purchases immediately after
“don’t sell” notices. The principle is
proving extremely difficult to apply in
the case of Adelaide-based Sporting
Arms Ltd., currently negotiating with
The Chartist says:
INVESTORS could expect further growth from AUSTRALIAN GUARANTEE
CORPORATION. This stock moved in a 30 percent uptrend from the begin-
ning of 1961 until early 1964, when a downtrend followed to a low point of
$1.12. A reversal pattern has since formed and the stock is now establishing a new
uptrend; investors could take advantage of any short-term reaction to buy near
the trend line about $1.40. The base consolidation suggests a further rise to about
$1.85 eventually. Last sale price on July 21 $1.50.

its U.S. affiliate, Omark Industries,
Inc.
Since the board announced a week
ago that Omark, which already holds
57 percent of its capital, was contem-
plating an offer, sellers have held out
at about 150 cents, with buyers no
higher than 117 cents. It’s a fair bet,
given the close association (working
and otherwise) between the two com-
panies, that a deal will be worked out
satisfactory to the boards concerned.
What this will mean in cash terms is
anyone’s guess.
Sporting Arms has been maufactur-
ing under licence to Omark since 1958,
enlarging its own rifle and shotgun
lines first with Omark’s powder acti-
vated fastening tools, and, later, with
its chain saws. A remarkable aspect of
the link is that Sporting Arms has ex-
ported Omark tools back to North
American markets.
The company has prospered under
this arrangement, and prospects seem
bright indeed. It will be a pity if the
takeover is consummated. The link has
been a happy example of the relation-
ship possible between U.S. and local
capital where small companies are the
vehicles.
AS General Foods was sufficiently
attracted by the image and
profitability of Cottee’s to offer
in cash three times the net asset
backing for each share, what would an
international company be prepared to
bid for the enigmatic arch-conservative
Henry Jones Co-operative?
On book values, unrevised apparently
in forty years, Henry Jones’ $1 shares
are worth $5.44, but in the current
market apathy the shares have been
allowed to drift to $3.55, within cents
of this year’s and last year’s lowest
levels.
At last inspection two years ago
Henry Jones’ share register revealed
that perhaps 10 percent of paid capital
of ss.Bm. was held by directors and
their families. This is not enough to
exert much influence on remaining
shareholders against a very attractive
offer in hard cash.
LAST week’s depressing repetition
of the unpleasant pattern of “in-
formed selling” in oil shares once
again demonstrates in simple terms the
reason why so many Australian oil
searching companies find it hard to
raise money from the public.
Inevitably someone in the market
knows about bad news from an oil
driller long before the co,mpany makes
its announcement. Last week, with
Alliance Petroleum, the shares had gone
as high as 17 cents at the beginning
of the week but by Thursday had
dropped to 12 cents.
Then on Friday they fell to only
nine cents and the company announced
it had failed in its Chandos well to
find the commercial quantities of
hydrocarbons it so confidently (and so
publicly) expected back in May when
it revealed it had encountered “increas-
ing hydrocarbons with depth.”
Small price movements can make
or lose a lot of money for investors in
low priced oil stocks, and directoral
statements can often have some in-
fluence on the market. Apart from
raising once again the unpleasant matter
of prior knowledge, the Alliance situa-
tion underlines that investors in this
market should avoid counting their
chickens before they are hatched—even
when directors themselves do the
counting.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Edwards Dunlop Defends
THE Edwards Dunlop-B.J. Ball
merger has all the appearances
of a defensive .move in reply to
the takeover operations of the Reed
Paper Group. But the benefits it should
bring in economies of scale in buying
and manufacturing and rationalising of
resources seem likely to be enough to
justify the association on these scores
alone.
The merger will create the biggest
of what will now be only four distri-
butors (these used to be six) in Aus-
tralia of Associated Pulp and Paper
Mills products.
The others are an Australian com-
pany, Dalton Bros. Holdings (which
was about the same size in paper distri-
bution as Edwards Dunlop without
Ball), and the two British-controlled
groups, the Bowater Corporation of
Australia Pty. and Reed Paper Pro-
ducts (Holdings) Ltd., now merging
Alex Cowan (Aust.) Pty. and Spicers
(Aust.) Pty. (a by-product of Reed
Paper Group Ltd. of England taking
over their UK parents Alex Cowan and
Sons Ltd. and Spicers Ltd.).
There is nothing new about the urge
to merge in this industry. Ball was the
recipient of takeover overtures from
Spicers in 1964 and Dalton Bros, back
in 1961, both of which were rejected.
But the urge has apparently been forti-
fied by the Spicer-Cowan merger via
Reeds. Ball and Edwards Dunlop have
agreed to exchange three Edwards Dun-
lop ordinaries for five Ball ordinaries
or convertible notes, and cash for Ball
preference shares. This could involve
the issue of up to 1,335,750 new Ed-
wards Dunlop shares, bringing paid
capital to $5,301,750.
J7)DWARDS DUNLOP has seen for
some years that scope for growth was
in the paper processing (converting)
side of its business rather than mer-
chanting, which can only increase with
population growth. The distributor is
not in control of his mark-up on local
paper, as the paper maker is up against
import competition and has to justify
his costs to the Tariff Board. But the
APPM distribution is the largest part
of Edwards Dunlop’s paper merchant-
ing (it also handles imported paper)
and in the year to April 30 its .merchant
operations (covering paper and board,
stationery, and machinery) showed its
best profit increase for some years.
In recent years, Edwards Dunlop
has been acquisitive in the fringe pac-
kaging area of paper and cellulose
bags. In March, 1961, it bought out
W. Nevill and Co. Ltd., manufacturing
stationer, and in January, 1962, Olym-
pic Stationery Ltd. in the same field
in New Zealand. Galwey and Co Pty.,
another subsidiary, bought the Maxima
companies in March, 1963, which made
transparent film bags.
Events of the last year will leave
Edwards Dunlop not only in a stronger
position to compete but will also make
it more independent. The chairman of
Edwards Dunlop, Mr. J. W. Dunlop,
had been a director of the Australian
Reed company until Reeds took over
his competitor, Cowan. And in a major
policy move, further increasing its
scope for action, Edwards Dunlop late
last year disposed of its large share-
holdings in Reed Paper Products
(Holdings) Ltd. and Reed and
Associates Pty. Ltd.
Apart from the sale of Reed shares,
last year Edwards Dunlop sold other
investments to provide extra working
capital, reducing them from $795,000
in the 1965 accounts to $168,000. Pro-
fit on their liquidation and the sale
of a surplus Perth property added
$91,634 to reserves.
Earning rate for 1965-66 was better
than usual, following an 11 percent
profit gain on the previous year, which
was a period of relative stagnation. The
profit improvement slowed down in the
closing months of 1965-66, but sales
in May and June, 1966, are still well
ahead of last year. However, directors
caution that sales and profit may not
hold the rate of increase achieved in
1965-66.
Apart from the visible reserves, which
add $3 million in shareholders’ funds
on to the paid capital of $4 million,
Edwards Dunlop accounts are solidly
lined with inner reserves. Plant is
shown less depreciation of $1,755,000,
including a special reserve of almost
$200,000. Among current liabilities
and provisions is an item of almost
$600,000 described as provision for
stock depreciation and contingencies,
which could conceivably be considered
superfluous one day.
Freeholds are in the books at $764,000
“at valuation” and $2.6m “at cost.”
As the company has been established
for almost 100 years, it is highly likely
that freeholds are very much under-
valued on today’s market. Ball would
bring to the group land and buildings
valued at $915,000, including a new
warehouse at Richmond (Vic.).
If the new group could dispose of
some freeholds at profit, a better re-
turn would be exhibited on funds in-
vested and capital reserves strengthened
for future bonuses. The last was three-
for-five in December, 1955.

COMMODITIES
Uranium Search On Again
FROM Moab, Utah, to Beaverlodge,
Saskatchewan, the geiger-counters
are clicking. Once again miners are
prospecting for uranium. The day of
the small man has (practically) passed
and large organisations—Western
Nuclear Power Co., Utah Construction
Co., and Federal Resources, for instance
—are sending well-equipped parties of
geologists into the field.
Currently the old mines in produc-
tion anywhere in the world are building
up Government stockpiles—at a price
of $U.5.4.90 a lb. in Canada, almost
the only operator at present. Talk of
large-scale contracts with European
nations is rife, with France and Ger-
many at present the most mentioned as
buyers. Japan is also a prospective
customer.
But, as well as the longer-term market
damper provided by the development
of extremely efficient nuclear power
plants, the attitude of Canadian and,
perhaps, other established producers
may also hold back prices. There is a
feeling in Canadian mining circles that
producers will attempt to hold prices
down to discourage the development of
new mines.
A pointer to the levels which might
be held is given by the president of
Denison Mines, owner of perhaps the
world’s biggest uranium mine, who re-
cently said, “We feel any sales con-
tracts between now and 1970 will be
in the $6-$6.50 range. After that we
see a price of $8.50 for Canadian
uranium.”
Eight dollars fifty would provide
excellent profits for Australia’s present
miners, using plant already depreci-
ated. But new sources could find such
a ceiling inhibiting. The price for
Mary Kathleen Uranium’s sales to the
U.K. Government before the last boom
collapsed has been estimated at about
$lO a lb. But Mary Kathleen is a low-
cost producer costs representing per-
haps only a third of that sale price in
later years.
Because of the view taken by power
authorities that supplies for each
nuclear station should be contracted for
25 to 30 years, the relatively s,mall re-
serves of local operators may leave
them only the role of smaller, lower-
price, fill-in supply contractors, while
the two giant Canadian producers
obtain long-term deals at better prices.
Tin Use Lags
WORLD tin consumption lagged
behind year-earlier levels in the
first three months of this year.
In that quarter consumption is
estimated as being down by perhaps
1000 tons.
However, the fall in U.S. consump-
tion for the period was 7.5 percent or
1185 tons probably more than the
drop in world use. And the U.S. decline
was largely accounted for by a fall in
tin used for tin-coated steel tin-
plate.
The decline in this section was due
solely to liquidation by users of the
large stocks built up in the first nine
months of 1965 as a hedge against
strikes. This not only cut buying after
the danger ended, but boosted buying
in the previous year’s comparison
periods.
The statistics for the quarter reveal
one small but interesting growth area
for tin, chemicals. Quarterly U.S. con-
sumption was 275 tons, against 206 a
year earlier. Tin serves a vital role in
several chemical areas, but consumption
is at present only tiny.
Hope for Rubber
SOME hope (although little more
than a hope) for improvement in
natural rubber’s bleak outlook is
offered by a process enabling its use in
tyre tread.
Although natural rubber is used ex-
tensively in other parts of the tyre, it
has been excluded from the dominant
tread market for the past 10 years on
the basis of price, skid-resistance, and
wear.
The reason for the dominance of
synthetics so far has been the failure
to develop a low-cost oil-extended
natural rubber. But the Natural Rub-
ber Producer s’ Association now
announces that it has shown that
large quantities of oil can be added to
natural rubber (during the mixing cycle
in the tyre factory) with no difficulty.
Addition of oil in some cases
making up one-third final mixture
also lowers the cost of rubber, an im-
portant factor both for consumers and
for producers.
Zambia's Copper
WITH 90,000 tons of copper al-
ready stockpiled in Zambia,
estimates of the time needed to
arrange alternative transport to the
sea following the break with Rhodesia
have again been revised upward. Once
again the maximum potential of the
alternative routes has been estimated
at 40,000 tons a month, less than 60
percent of normal Zambian production.
But the date for achieving this figure
has now been set as “three or four
months’ time” by Zambia’s Transport
Minister, Mr. Banda. It is estimated
that not more than 18,000 tons has
been exported on the new routes since
May 24, when the Rhodesia link was
cut.
MINING
What Glitter in Gold?
ALTHOUGH the tax-free aspect of
dividends always adds a certain
glitter to gold shares in con-
trast with the dullness of the progres-
sively declining Australian gold-produc-
tion figures, goldminers have been re-
ceiving more attention than usual. This
stems mainly from recent speculation
on the possibility of the devaluation of
sterling, on the basis that any devalu-
ation of the currency would, in effect,
mean an increase in the price of gold.
More significant in the long term is
the constantly recurring speculation on
an actual increase in the price of gold.
This has been discounted by many
authorities as highly improbable in the
near future in view of the firm U.S.
Treasury policy to maintain its price
at SUS3S per ounce, fixed over 30
years ago. Such authorities have sought
some means of supplementing gold as
a step toward solving the world’s
liquidity problems.
Despite the fact that world gold pro-
duction, in physical terms, has more
than doubled since 1950, more than
half of this newly mined gold has not
been absorbed into the international
monetary system, but has been acquired
for non-monetary purposes, chiefly
hoarding. Those monetary experts who
favor a revaluation in the price of gold
(some consider it should be at least
double the present price) believe that
$35 an ounce is an incentive for
hoarders to acquire gold cheaply.
These views were discussed in 3
recent publication of the Transvaal and
Orange Free State Chamber of Mines,
whose members account for almost the
entire South African gold production.
South Africa, in turn, is by far the
largest gold producer in the world.
In 1965 gold production in the Western
world showed a small increase, provided
mainly by South Africa. By compari-
son, most producers in the Western
world recorded decreased production.
However, reflecting the experience of
the world goldmining industry in gen-
eral, the increase in South African pro-
duction, on the whole, involved a
considerable increase in working costs,
which in turn forced an increase in the
grade of ore milled. This had the effect
of transferring a quantity of ore re-
serves to the unpayable category to be
left unmined, possibly for ever.
The Chamber of Mines article sug-
gested that world monetary authorities
who have been concerned at the present
level of gold production and the possi-
bility of a future decline should, rather
than seeking ways of supplementing
gold, try to determine whether a sub-

accounting, corporate
finance,, market tech-
niques, and technical
studies come to you
per medium of:
FACTOGRAPH
The purpose of each
“Factograph” is to
provide investors with a
comprehensive, ten-
year analysis of the
performance of the
Company under review,
supplemented with a
technical study of
market behaviour dur-
ing the past three years.
All important facts are
presented in such a
manner that the “Fact-
ograph” itself leads
up, step by step, to an
ultimate recommenda-
tion to “buy,” “sell,”
or “hold” at the price
currently prevailing.
This form of presenta-
tion enables investors to
see how the actual facts
themselves (both funda-
mental and technical)
tell the story of the
stock, and, in effect,
determine what the
recommendation must
be.
Each year, 200
stocks are reviewed in
the “Factograph” series.
These stocks comprise:
(a) 50 leaders.
(b) 150 others—prim-
arily those with
the most favour-
able apparent
growth potential,
but subject to size
and marketability.
Although it is pos-
sible to produce such a
comprehensive review
as is encompassed by
each “Factograph”
only once annually, we
recognise that the out-
look for individual
stocks may undergo
change at any time.
Therefore each of the
200 stocks included in
the “Factograph” series
is subject to up-dating
commentary at least
once in every month
in the pages of the
“Daily Market Digest”
and more frequently if
required.
In this way readers
are kept constantly in-
formed of the current
prospects of all stocks
in the series, and may
arrange the composi-
tion of their own Port-
folios accordingly.
DAILY MARKET
DIGEST
As we have indicated
above, this publication,
which is dispatched
every day, Monday to
Thursday, is the
medium by which sub-
scribers are kept con-
stantly up to date with
the action which they
should take in respect
of specific stocks.
Urgent action is fre-
quently necessary as a
protection against loss,
or as a means of de-
riving the greatest
gains. That is why the
investment service pro-
vided by this Company,
unlike any other in
Australia, is available
on a daily basis
(although a weekly
service is available if
preferred).
The following fea-
tures are included in
the “Daily Market
Digest”:
1. Interpretation of
current investment de-
velopments of import-
ance (as required).
2. “Special Situa-
tions” above average
opportunities for
growth (as they occur).
3. “Chartgain” a
weekly summary pre-
pared by our technical
division, of current op-
portunities for gain
discernible from in-
terpretation of price
movement charts.
4. “Supervisory Ser-
vice” an up-dated
list of current action
required in respect of
the 200 stocks in the
“Factograph” service;
“Special Situa tio n s”
previously reported in
the “Daily Market
Digest”; and stocks
previously covered by
“Chartgain.” The pur-
pose of the “Super-
visory Service,” which
appears daily, is to
enable readers to be
immediately informed
of action required in
respect of stocks which
they are holding.
5. Fifty Leaders Ser-
vice—up-dated reports
on stocks which are
included amongst the
fifty leaders. Although
these stocks form part
of the 200 covered in
the “Factograph” ser-
vice, and are therefore
also dealt with in the
“Supervisory Service”
(see above), the pur-
pose of the “Fifty
Leaders Service” is to
enable readers to be
even more fully in-
formed about those
particular stocks
which the greatest
number of them are
likely to be holding in
the greatest quantity.
Comments upon one or
other of the fifty
leaders are published as
circumstances require.
COWAN INVEST-
MENT DIGEST
This is a weekly pub-
lication, dispatched
every Friday. It com-
prises part of the com-
plete service, but is also
available for separate
subscription by those
who do not require the
very exhaustive cover-
age otherwise avail-
able. The contents
comprise:
1. “Out look” a
summary of the outlook
for equity investment in
the short-term, and
long-term, based upon
Economic Indicators
and Technical Indica-
tors of market be-
haviour.
2. Indicator Page
a visual illustration of
the current condition
of the Indicators upon
which the outlook for
equity investment is
determined.
3. Notes for long-
term investors.
4. Supervised Port-
folio for short-term in-
vestors.
5. Major Recommen-
dation of the week.

FCN.2
stantial increase in the price of gold
would provide an annual increment to
reserves sufficient for the needs of the
international monetary system in an ex-
panding world trade.
Support for an upward revaluation
of gold has also come from Russia,
which is believed to be the world’s
second-largest gold producer, although
no accurate figures of Russian produc-
tion have been available since the 19305.
Most production returns from Aus-
tralian goldminers seem to reflect the
world pattern of declining production
and increasing costs. However, the
amendments introduced last year to the
Gold Mining Industry Assistance Act,
which extended the relief payable for
costs in excess of SA27 per ounce, will
benefit producers whose costs have ex-
ceeded this figure. Against this picture
of an industry struggling to survive, it
is well to consider that any strengthen-
ing in the demands for an upward
revaluation of gold could bring back the
glitter which belonged to gold shares
in Australia’s early mining days.
Two of the smaller Australian pro-
ducers which have shown a decline in
production in 1965/66 are the Queens-
lander Golden Plateau N.L. and the
Western Australian Hill 50 Gold Mine
N.L. Golden Plateau produced 12,9100 z.
of gold and Hill 50 43,1510 z. in the
52 weeks to June 28, 1966, compared
with 14,1780 z. and 64,5570 z. respectively
last financial year. It seems lively that
profits of both companies will be sub-
stantially lower this year in view of
expectations of increased costs (par-
ticularly by Hill 50), partly because
of development programs being
undertaken. At this stage it is ’ not
known whether the companies will
qualify for payments under the Industry
Assistance Act, but both companies
have expressed hopes of receiving such
benefits.
Last month, the directors of Golden
Plateau N.L., at the time of the pay-
ment of the steady June dividend of
2.5 cents per share, warned that the
anticipated reduced profit for 1965/66
would have to be taken into account by
the board when considering the
December, 1966, dividend (last year
5 cents).
HILL 50, on the other hand, deferred
consideration of the dividend,
usually paid early in the calendar year,
until August. Prior to that the two nor-
mal half-yearly dividends were reduced
from 4d. each in 1964 to 2d. each in
1965. However, a fact worth remem-
bering is that the company has a con-
siderable investment portfolio, valued at
approximately $360,000 last December
against its cost to the company of about
$280,000.
By contrast, New Guinea Goldfields
Ltd. seems to be in a very happy posi-
tion this year. Total production from
the Golden Ridges mill and the
Koranga tail race was 19,5240 z. in
the year to June 30, 1966, compared
with 16,6500 z. in the previous year,
when gold production also showed an
increase and working costs were re-
duced. As a result, the company failed
to qualify for any subsidy. Despite this,
net profit rose from $243,728 in 1963/64
to $305,690 in 1964/65, of which
$156,510 was derived from mining and
$149,180 from other trading activities.
Apart from mining, the company has
diversified interests in New Guinea, in-
cluding sawmilling and logging opera-
tions, which are to be expanded, a coffee
plantation, a freight service operating
between Wau and Lae, and a trading
division holding various agencies in the
Territory.
The company has paid steady tax-
free yearly dividends of 4d per share
since 1963 from its mining profits, trad-
ing profits being retained for further
development. In view of the increased
production this year, it seems likely
that the December dividend will be at
least 4 cents per share.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
"All Square" in the Long Term
Pricing Elders GM. for a dividend rise
THE average of the..high and low
prices of Elder Smith Golds-
brough Mort Ltd. in the past three
years (since the “merger” with Golds-
brough Mort) is $2.32 and the last
sale in the first week of 1966 was at
precisely this amount. From this price
the trend was fairly steadily down-
wards until a low point was reached
of $2.01 in the second week of April.
The price then rose quickly until $2.38
was reached in mid-May, only to fall
back to $2.15 in the second week of
June. A fairly steady rise over the past
four weeks has carried the price back
to $2.40. At this price the dividend
yield is just under 4.2 percent and, if
the disclosed earning rate is adjusted
for the apparent over-provision for tax,
and for the substantial provision against
doubtful debts, the earnings yield is a
high 11.5 percent. In other words, the
shares are selling at 8.7 times earn-
ings.
The above figures would indicate
that a trader who was able to judge
the swings in the market price could
have found Elders’ shares a remunera-
tive investment over the past six
months. But it must be regarded as at
least doubtful whether the same can be
said for the long-term investor who has
held the shares continually over the
past ten years. He would have seen a
capital appreciation of under 37 per-
cent over eleven years, which works out
at only 2.9 percent compound per
annum, or just about the “inflation”
rate. This means that, in real terms,
the long-term investor is “all square.”
While Elders G.M. is a property
owner, it is best described as a “pas-
toral finance company.” This is very
clear from the diagram which appears
on page three of the last annual re-
port and shows that 12/3 of every £1
employed was invested in “advances
and other debtors.” The investment in
“premises and plant” represented 3/9
in every £1 and this would include the
station properties. However, also in-
cluded in this figure are the company’s
many offices, wool stores, and country
branches.
It might also be of interest to see
how these funds have been raised and
a similar dissection of the liabilities side
would show the following:
Shareholders’ funds 10/-
Secured loans /II
Bank credit 1/11
Clients' balances 8< deposits 4/11
Trade creditors 1/1
Provisions 1/2
20/-
Of the clients’ balances and deposits,
about lid. would be due after 12
months, and of the secured loans about
7d. is due within 12 months. This
means that, ignoring the provisions
(which are largely tax and dividend
provisions), about 7/7 in each £1 is
repayable within 12 months.
The most remarkable facet of this
structure is that it has been so suc-
cessful without resorting to the high
gearing which exists in the commer-
cial counterparts—the finance com-
panies. The reason for this must surely
be in the many and varied services
which Elders provides apart from
financing its clients. Selling wool,
produce, livestock, and tobacco is no
doubt an important source of revenue,
and contributions of some consequence
would be made by the shipping, mer-
chandising (both rural and industrial),
real estate agency, and insurance agency.
The annual reports of Elders G.M. give
quite detailed information on the turn-
over of the various divisions and it
is possible to compile the following
table:
$ million
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965
Wool sales n.a. 203.3 243.8 197.0
Produce

Insurance 3.7 3.8 4.1 4.4
Balancing item . . (0.4) 8.1
Total sales 476.0 571.3 538.0-
I cannot offer any explanation for the
“balancing item,” but the amounts in-
volved are hardly significant. These
figures largely confirm the position that
would have been assumed with the ex-
ception that industrial merchandise
seems to have become quite important
over the past three years.
To obtain a dissection of the gross
profit of the various “divisions” would
be much more difficult, even though
the rates of commission charged on the
various commodities are available. One
would guess that, on average, the wool
commission is about 2 percent, about
3 percent for livestock sales, probably
about percent for land and property,
but we have no idea of the mark-up on
merchandise sales.
$ million
Year to June 30 1963 1964 1965
Commission from sale of
wool, livestock, and
property 9.3 11.1 10.0
Other income 27.3 27.3 29.3
Income from trading 36.6 38.4 39.3
This other income would include
commission on other sales, such as
produce, tobacco, and insurance, and it
would also include profits from the
shipping, chartering, and travel agency
divisions. Presumably, it would include
trustee charges and income from the
company’s stations. We might guess
that commissions on other sales, profits
from other activities, and income from
the company’s properties would not
exceed $1.3 million in 1964/5 and some
figure might also be guessed at for the
interest income on the advances. This
would then leave a figure for the mark-
up on merchandise sales of nearly $23
million, or about 26 percent on sales.
The only growth area seems to be
industrial merchandise, which now rep-
resents about 8 percent of total sales,
but profit margins may be declining.
Elder Smith G.M. should have status
close to a commercial bank and this
suggests a dividend yield of about
5 percent. Those who have been pay-
ing $2.40 must be expecting a dividend
increase in the near future.

Unease on the Companies Acts
A reply to the Attorney-General of New South Wales
By PETER CLYNE, LL.B.
THE strength of a prosecution often
becomes most clearly apparent
when the accused has been ably
defended and you have heard every-
thing that can be said in his defence.
For this reason the Attorney-General’s
“Case FOR the Companies Acts”
(BULLETIN, July 16) will make many
people more uneasy than ever about
the procedures created by those Acts.
Mr. McCaw was replying to a pre-
vious article (BULLETIN, July 2) in
which I endeavored to show that basic
and essential rights, or, to quote from
another case cited by Mr. McCaw,
“some of the common law’s traditional
consideration for the individual,” are
being whittled down.
Mr. McCaw says, one might observe
in passing, that these rights have been
slipping away since 1940 in Victoria,
and since 1948 in England. But is this
likely to set anyone’s fears at rest? What,
then, is Mr. McCaw’s answer to each
of my indictments? Let us take them
one by one.
1. The step of “declaring ” a company
open for investigation affects the future
rights and welfare of that company and
of its directors.
Mr. McCaw concedes this, as indeed
he must. But he says that it is only a
contributing factor to the company’s
ultimate destruction. I went too far,
he claims, in saying that “the very act
of declaring the foundering vessel will
sink it on the spot.” Most of the vessels
concerned would have sunk anyway.
Perhaps so. The fact remains that at
the time when a company is in difficul-
ties, and when its continued survival
must depend on public confidence, a
public declaration must normally take
effect as a coup de grace.
2. This step may be taken and pub-
lished to the world before the com-
pany has the slightest opportunity of
answering what is alleged against it.
Yes, says Mr. McCaw, but not until
the Governor has certain evidence be-
fore him, and feels satisfied that it
should be taken. We simply have to
trust the wisdom and probity of the
Executive.
Here we come to the heart of the
matter, and the same conflict will be-
come apparent at later points in this
discussion. There is, of course, all the
difference in the world between rights
guaranteed by law and rights which
the Executive in its wisdom may or may
not grant to the citizen. The whole con-
cept of rights protected by the Court
involves an implicit lack of trust in the
perpetual wisdom and probity of the
Executive. Why, for instance, should we
worry about trial by jury if we were
sure that the police can always be
trusted to send only the guilty man to
prison?
Mr. McCaw seems to concede this
when he says that “any defence which
relies to any degree upon the beneficial
exercise of those powers by the Execu-
tive will receive something less . than
universal approval.”
“There is perhaps room for argu-
ment,” Mr. McCaw also concedes, “on
the question whether the directors of
a company should be given an op-
portunity to answer what is alleged
against them prior to the declaration
being made or inspectors being ap-
pointed.” Apparently they were given
this opportunity in England up to
1962.
The only argument against giving
them this opportunity seems to be the
view expressed by witnesses before
some committee in England that this
would forewarn the directors of what is
alleged against them “and thus gives
them ample opportunity, if they are
so minded, to destroy or fabricate
evidence . . . (and) leads to lengthy
delays while the directors compose
their reply.”
3. Once this step (“declaring” a
company) is taken, the inspector has
powers to seize the company's books,
gain access to confidential records,
question anyone he pleases and insist
on an answer.
M R McCAW’S only reply is that
since 1964, by virtue of some
amendment, the inspector has to give
the books back when he is finished with
them and he has to allow the company
to have a look at their own books if
they want to do so in the meantime.
In this sphere, I suppose, one has to
be thankful for small mercies.
4. In particular, he can compel per-
sons associated with the company to
give incriminatory answers, and un-
less they utter a certain kind of magic
formula in the course of their question-
ing, these answers may later be used to
prove their guilt.
With this, too, Mr. McCaw finds
himself in agreement, although he dis-
putes my version of what this magic
formula has to be. My view is that, if
a person under interrogation is com-
pelled to give answers which will tend
to incriminate him and he wants to
ensure that his answers will not be
used against him, he must object to
every question before he answers it.
This view seems to be supported by
the actual wording of the N.S.W.
Companies Act 1961-1964, section
171(5), and the same provision applies
in every State of the Commonwealth.
The Act reads as follows: “If he
claims that the answer to any ques-
tion might incriminate him and, but
for this subsection he would have been
entitled to refuse to answer the question,
the answer to the question shall not be
used in any subsequent criminal pro-
ceedings ...”
Mr. McCaw believes that a blanket
objection is enough, viz., that a person
under interrogation can say: “I object
to any questions on this subject,” or,
indeed, “I object to any questions
you are going to ask me,” and that
if he does this none of his answers
will become admissible against him.’
This belief appears to be in conflict
with the wording of the Act and there
is no reported decision- to support it.
The authors of the Australian Com-
pany Practice (His Honor Mr. Justice
Wallace, now the President of the
N.S.W. Court of Appeal, and Mr. J.
Mcl. Young, Q.C. of the Victorian
Bar) do not agree with Mr. McCaw
in this respect, for they say (at page
517): “It is suggested that objection
must be taken to individual questions in
order to gain the protection of the sub-
section and that a ‘blanket’ objection
will not do.”
Mr. McCaw claims to find some
support in an address by Mr. Justice
Gowans made to the Victorian Bar
on July 29, 1965, and reported in
Volume 39 of the Australian Law
Journal at page 334. This refers to
a decision which is in none of the official
reports, but His Honor does seem to
have held on one occasion that a blanket
objection operates as an objection to a
whole series of questions without being
repeated each time. My ps>int, however,
is that this is a highly technical matter
on which even the legal experts obviously
disagree. Should a person under in-
terrogation, denied the right of legal
representation, be put in the position
where he can be made to convict him-
self out of his own mouth unless, in a
highly technical and uncertain field of
law, he manages to speak the correct
form of legal incantation?
5. These persons have no right to legal
represenlation when they are being
questioned, and they are often ques-
tioned by skilled and experienced senior
counsel.
Inspectors often do allow legal
representation, says Mr. McCaw, “so
far as practicable.” But here again we
are confronted with the difference be-
tween a right guaranteed by law and
a right voluntarily conferred by the
Executive or its delegate. The right
to counsel in such circumstances is a
basic right which should not depend
on. the goodwill or the sense of fair-
ness of individual inspectors or on the
policies of particular governments.
However, Mr. McCaw also seems to

suggest that witnesses in the course
of an investigation do have a right to
be legally represented, and that this
view is in some way supported by the
High Court’s decision in the Testro
case.
With this view I cannot agree. What
happened in the Testro case was that
the same counsel appeared before the
inspector and sought leave to appear
both for the company which was being
investigated (Testro Bros. Pty. Ltd.)
and for its managing director (Rex
Clifford Testro), who was to be a wit-
ness. The inspector refused them both
permission to be represented by
counsel. The company appealed against
this refusal, and ultimately the High
Court (by a majority of three judges
to two) held that the inspector hacl
rightly refused the company’s request.
But Mr. Testro had also appealed,
quite independently, against the in-
spector’s refusal to allow him to be
represented by counsel. The High
Court granted him special leave to
appeal. When his appeal came on for
hearing, the inspector explained in the
High Court that he had misunderstood
the position, and had not appreciated
that Mr. Testro as well as the com-
pany had sought to be represented. If
he had understood this to be the case,
he said, he would have allowed Mr.
Testro’s counsel to appear for him.
Now the High Court never grants
special leave to appeal on a legal issue
which is merely academic, and which
does not really arise for decision. In
view of the inspector’s explanation,
the High Court rescinded the special
leave it had granted Mr. Testro, since
in the light of the inspector’s explana-
tion the issue was merely a theoretical
one. The question I am discussing was
therefore not finally decided one way
or the other.
What Mr. McCaw overlooks, how-
ever, is that a witness’ right to legal
representation can only be based on
the claim that the investigation is the
kind of judicial inquiry to which the
rules of natural justice are applicable;
and that this claim was expressly re-
jected by the Supreme Court of Vic-
toria in the Viney case, and by the
majority decision of the High Court
in the Testro case, which upheld the
Viney decision.
IN the light of these precedents, a
witness could not possibly claim a
RIGHT to legal representation, even
though I admit the matter has not
been decided expressly and in so many
words; and he has to fall back on the
goodwill or discretion or practice of
individual inspectors. This is the es-
sence of my complaint, and Mr. McCaw
has not answered it.
6. The investigated company has no
right to be legally represented, or to
know what is alleged against it, or to
challenge or cross-examine its accusers,
or to defend itself against an adverse
report.
Mr. McCaw does not dispute this,
but he says in effect that the public
interest requires so radical a departure
from “the common law’s traditional
consideration for the individual.” He
cites a judgment of His Honor Mr.
Justice Windeyer to support the view
that, if such a departure from accepted
notions of fairness is authorised by par-
liament, “effect must be given to the
statute which embodies this policy.”
This is true, of course. Effect must be
given to such a statute BY THE
COURTS, and this is exactly what
the High Court did, with obvious re-
luctance, in the Testro case.
But surely it is no answer to someone
who criticises a statute or its under-
lying policies to say that the Courts
are compelled to give effect to them.
7. Yet an adverse report may ruin
the company and those whom the in-
spector has interrogated (a) because
it can be used as the basis of winding-
up proceedings . . .
Not automatically, says Mr. McCaw.
The Court still has a kind of residual
discretion to overrule the inspector’s
opinion. But the fact remains that the
inspector’s opinion has been made a
ground for taking winding-up proceed-
ings against the company, and therefore
it substantially affects the company’s
rights. All I am saying is that such a
report should be made subject to the
normal safeguard that nothing should
be done to affect anyone’s rights with-
out giving that person or company a
chance to be heard in his (or its) own
defence.
..(b) because it is evidence not
only of the inspector’s opinion but of the
supposed facts on which his opinion
is based . . .”
This evidence can be rebutted, says
Mr. McCaw, and I agree with him. But
does this not reverse the presumption of
innocence, which is yet another vital
principle apparently jettisoned for the
sake of the “public interest”? Normally
a man is presumed to be innocent
unless he is proved to be guilty. If a
policeman’s opinion that he is guilty
were some evidence of his guilt, so that
thereupon he had to prove his inno-
cence, the presumption of innocence
would have been overthrown. This is
what I maintain has happened to com-
pany suspects, though here the police-
man is called an “inspector.”
. . . and (c) because its publication
prejudices the fair trial of persons who
are later tried on criminal charges.
Very fairly, Mr. McCaw agrees with
this. Yet he seems to favor publication
of the report before trial if this is the
only way in which shareholders and
creditors can be warned that they
should take civil proceedings against
the company.
It is open to question whether a man’s
right to a fair and unprejudiced trial
should ever be sacrificed merely to
enable those to whom his activities are
alleged to have caused loss to bring
civil proceedings without delay. What
is to stop them suing after the criminal
proceedings are concluded?
But the important thing is that even
on so vital an issue as the right to a
fair trial by a jury whose mind is un-
warped by publicity, the accused now
stands or falls on having the right kind
of Attorney-General in control. A man
as fairminded and as liberal in his
thinking as Mr. McCaw would un-
doubtedly refrain, most of the time,
from having the report published
before the trial of those concerned.
Other men in his place might, in all
honesty, prefer the public interest to
that of individual accused persons.

The New Margarine-Butter War
By PETER SAMUEL
THE sporadic margarine-butter war
of old has recently been escalated
by the injection of huge amounts
of money and the full-scale mobilisa-
tion of the heavy public relations in-
dustry. Amid the hectic crossfire it is
difficult for the casual observer to sort
out rights and wrongs, false claims and
correct ones. Fortunately this is a
limited war, fought under the jurisdic-
tion of governments and courts. So
it is possible to take an armchair view.
Not that I should claim to be an
entirely impartial observer. We eat
margarine at home. It’s easier to
spread, a little cheaper, just as palat-
able, and, well, there may be something
in the claims that animal fats contri-
bute to heart disease. And there is
something distinctly authoritarian about
the production restrictions to which
margarine producers are subjected. A
sense of justice and concern for the
interests of consumers dictates opposi-
tion to Government-guaranteed privi-
leges to a particular group of pro-
ducers.
But the case for margarine does seem
to me to have been grossly overstated
in some of the advertising. For a start,
it is not a simple matter of one set of
Australian producers at another. As
the table shows, the implication that
the raw materials for margarine are
now predominantly Australian is quite
mistaken.

Until recently, local production was
quite insignificant in relation to im-
ports, and even on the latest estimates
three-quarters of the raw materials are
imported. So Mrs. Jones is being led
astray if she thinks her margarine is
now entirely Australian, though, of
course, that is no reason for her to
throw away her flag. It is quite sen-
sible to use imported materials where
they can be produced much more
cheaply abroad than locally, but it is
misleading to present margarine as
being as Australian as butter.
There is a second point which
follows from this. It is far too glib
to state that the local oilseed growers
have a “limitless” potential market
and that they are being held back
solely by restrictions on the production
of margarine. A consideration of price
levels, tariff protection, and technology
suggests a rather different conclusion.
Let us take the various oilseeds one
by one.
1. COTTONSEED: From a quite
insignificant industry, producing less
than a tenth of the nation’s require-
ments prior to 1963, cotton in Aus-
tralia has indeed shown a spectacular
blossoming in the last few seasons.
Acreage has doubled and production
increased almost tenfold so that, cur-
rently, two-thirds of national require-
ments are being met locally. Within
three or four years it is expected that
self-sufficiency will be achieved. But
it is important to note that the cotton
industry is built on the production of
cotton lint. Cottonseed oil is a minor
by-product of growing cotton for the
fibre (31b. of cottonseed produces ap-
proximately lib. of fibre lint and 21b.
of oil; but the oil brings about 2c
against the lint’s 20c to 30c).
The production of cottonseed oil is
therefore obviously controlled by the
market for lint and will not be in-
fluenced one way or the other by the
demands of the margarine industry.
So to find out how much cottonseed
oil will be available it is necessary
to ask what will be the economic
limits to the expansion of cotton grow-
ing for lint. Mr. W. Kerridge, in a
very informative article in the latest
Quarterly Review of Agricultural
Economics, explains in some detail the
difficulties which now face cotton
growers in continuing the expansion
of recent years. They have a bounty
scheme whereby there is a fixed bounty
fund, spreadable over the whole cotton
crop, so expansion means smaller
bounty payments per lb. produced, so
much so that growers will soon be
getting only 24c compared with over
30c of recent times.
JN addition, the depressed state of the
world cotton market means that
any further expansion will have to be
based on world prices of 20c or below.
Under these circumstances it is thought
that production, at present about 40m.
lb., is unlikely to go beyond 70m. or
80m. lb. Even at this level the seed
would yield only about 8000 tons of oil,
3000 or 4000 tons more than is being
currently produced. This, while a
cheap source of local raw material for
margarine manufacture, is not going
to go very far toward supporting the
“dynamic” expansion of margarine or
even to closing the import gap.
2. PEANUTS: As the table shows,
these have if anything been a declining
contributor to total vegetable oils pro-
ducts. One reason is simply that pea-
nut oil is more expensive about
$390 a ton compared with cottonseed
oil at $320 and safflower oil at $350.
But peanut oil is rather like cottonseed
oil in that it is something of a by-
product. Peanuts are grown principally
for kernels, for sale in cellophane bags
for eating at the footie or with cocktails
or beer. So far only the “culls”
broken or unformed nuts unsuitable for
eating have been used for oil pro-
duction. It simply does not pay to grow
peanuts for the oil, and, as long as that
is so, the production of oil will grow
gradually a few percent a year as the
market for edible nuts grows with the
population of football-goers, etc.
It has been claimed that it is econ-
omical to produce peanuts for oil alone,
and the Peanut Marketing Board has
recently said that acreage will be ex-
panded on this basis. Margarine pro-
ducers have, of course, made much of
this. Yet it has to be proved, and expert
opinion is still that this is wishful think-
ing.
3. SAFFLOWER: This yellow-
flowered thistle-like plant is presented
in advertising as the “dynamic new
primary industry” which margarine is
supporting. Through the purchase of
safflower, so it is said, great new op-
portunities will be opened up for prim-
ary producers. A planting of 150,000
acres of safflower is being spoken of
this year, and an oil production of
10,000 tons, a four-fold expansion on
last year’s crop. But there can justi-
fiably be a deal of scepticism about how
long production will last at this level.
A number of experts have expressed
doubts about its financial viability.
Professor J. R. McMillan, well-known
agricultural scientist, recently said that
it was a “risky crop to undertake at
the present stage and one that the
farmer should experiment with only in
a small restricted area.” He pointed
out its tenderness to frost, its oil-
yielding failure if rain does not come
at a critical stage in its growth cycle,
and its susceptibility to root rot under
irrigation. Professor F. Reuter, a food
technologist, has written that safflower
oil, unlike other vegetable oils, is ex-
tremely unstable, being likely to turn
rancid. This can only be overcome
through an expensive process called
hydrogenation.
Margarine made of safflower oil is
also expensive because of the need to
package it in cardboard cartons, as
otherwise it literally runs away. Its
use is confined to the manufacture of
“polyunsaturated” margarines, which
currently take about a quarter of the
total market for table margarines.
Polyunsaturateds, although more expen-
sive than other margarines, sell mainly
because of the fact that they contain
fewer of the fats which are said to
contribute to heart disease. There is
some doubt about the medical facts,
and if Australian consumers follow the
overseas pattern, then polyunsatur-
ateds may be only a passing fad. And
so would safflower.
In the meantime, doubts are being
expressed about whether it really pays.
The N.S.W. Director of Agriculture,
Mr. R. Watts, claimed that safflower
yields would need to be raised at least
four times the present level before it
could be recommended as a commercial

proposition. People in Primary Indus-
try in Canberra also speak of it as an
experimental crop, not established as a
plant that pays.
Another unjustified claim by mar-
garine producers is that regulations on
the composition of cooking and indus-
trial margarines hold back the use
of vegetable oils. At present these are
largely made of tallow, which is less
than half the price of vegetable oils.
There is no reason to think that
biscuit-makers, bakers, and pastry-
cooks, who operate in an extremely
competitive business, would be pre-
pared to use a margarine made more
expensive by the substitution.
Of course, the situation might change
if levels of protection were to be
altered, as they may well be, since the
Tariff Board is at present considering
the industry. At the moment they all
get a $96-a-ton tariff, which represents
a 35 percent level of protection. Pea-
nuts in addition to this are helped by
by-law arrangements under which four
gallons of oil can be imported free of
duty for every gallon bought locally.
And with peanut growers getting about
S6OO a ton for oil, as compared with
$390 for which foreign oil can be
bought, there is effectively a system
of protection equivalent to a 90 percent
tariff. Cottonseed, of course, benefits
from the general bounty as well as the
tariff.
rpHE dairying industry gets protec-
tion of the order of 15 percent
through subsidy and about the same
amount through the two-price scheme,
so it is fair to say that, if anything, it
is at present less heavily protected than
oil-seeds. And it may even be said that
if oilseeds are to expand they will
have to get even more protection than
now, for it evidently still pays to im-
port them.
The assiduously cultivated notion of
a self-reliant, go-ahead local oilseeds
industry pitted against a heavily subsi-
dised dairying industry becomes a fan-
tasy when examined against the facts.
But having said this it is necessary to
examine the claims made by dairying
representatives, who have recently
launched a vigorous counter-attack on
the margarine campaigners. The
dairymen have simpler arguments, and
where they are weak they are rather
simply refuted.
They say most emphatically and
often that the removal of quotas on
margarine would threaten the whole
dairy industry and the 600,000 people
it is said to support. This is melo-
dramatic nonsense. The fact is that
margarine quotas have been effectively
flouted for years now, and tragedy has
not befallen dairying. People’s tastes
change very slowly, and most people
can be expected to continue to buy
the natural product. And dairy farmers
need not stand helplessly by in the face
of competition. I understand that the
addition of a tiny quantity of vegetable
oil would produce a spreadable butter
at room temperature. That innovation
would take a lot of the go out of
margarine.
Price, too, is most important. That
is where the dairy industry must aban-
don its 1930 depression mentality,
stressing the need to make work. It
would be far more prosperous if it
were to recognise that it must push
ahead with consolidation of smaller
farms and get rid of a tail of produ-
cers who, through no fault of their own
usually, cannot make a decent living
under present circumstances.
Just as the coal-mining industry had
to be upgraded in productivity and
some workers displaced in the 1950 s as
petroleum became more competitive, so
dairying has to adjust. Not that the
adjustment need be anything like as
drastic as coal’s.
The immediate problem for State and
Federal Governments is what to do
about the margarine quotas and in par-
ticular Marrickville Margarine, which
has been openly disregarding them.
People who support the principle of
free competition will be grateful to
Marrickville for having opened up the
issue through its actions. But it is
difficult to see how any government
could in conscience allow them to go
on as they have. If they are not penal-
ised, then their rivals who have kept
within the quotas will in effect suffer
for their abstention.
However, it seems impossible to re-
turn to the old level of quotas now
that the market for margarine is so
much larger than the quotaed level of
production. The quotas will have to
be increased quickly to the present level
of margarine sales, or else an intoler-
able wartime-like situation will arise:
there will be rationing of margarine!

Sex Control among Cattle
A COUPLE of years ago an Indian
peasant approached his local arti-
ficial insemination centre, but
stipulated that his cow was not to be
inseminated until after sunset. In-
trigued, the director of the centre, Dr.
B. C. Battacharya, asked why. The
peasant remarked that when cows were
inseminated early in the day they pro-
duced mainly bull calves, but if done
later they were more likely to have
heifers.
Soon after, Battacharya went to study
at the famous Max Planck Institute in
West Germany, where he had facilities
to test this notion. Working with rab-
bits, he found a preponderance of
female offspring were indeed obtained
if insemination was delayed after the
semen had been collected. Professor
Erich Schiller has since announced that
the first large controlled experiment on
cattle has been completed and that the
heifer-calf rate was 75 percent, whereas
49 percent would have been the natural
rate. Scientists at Cambridge Univer-
sity, in England, are now conducting
even more thorough experiments, but
their findings are not yet to hand.
It has long been known that the sire
controls the sex of the progeny. If
the female egg happens to be fertilised
by a “male” sperm the offspring will
be a male, but if a “female” sperm
from the sire enters the egg the off-
spring will be female. In natural ser-
vice the chances are fifty-fifty that the
egg will meet a “male” sperm. The
Indian peasant’s observation has led to
the suggestion that female-producing
sperm are heavier and settle to the
bottom of a flask containing semen.
According to Schiller, the weight dif-
ference is so great in bull semen at
least that separation into male- and
female-producing sperm takes place
within an hour. Reliable techniques,
such as centrifuging, already exist for
separating minute particles from a
liquid suspension on the basis of
weight.
These findings suggest the distinct
possibility that in the near future far-
mers will be able to use artificial in-
semination to manipulate the proportion
of male to female offspring. This would
be a boon to dairy farmers especially,
who would be able to “order” female
calves. Beef producers could also be
interested, particularly those aiming to
raise bull-beef, since bull calves grow
appreciably faster than heifers. If so,
this could lead to a much greater
demand for A.I. services.
IT is something of a mystery that
research workers do not appear to
have hastened to discover whether this
weight difference between sperm exists
throughout the animal kingdom. All
animal breeding and production would
benefit from planned sex control.
Meanwhile, other developments are
taking place in artificial breeding here
in Australia. More and more dairy
farmers are now using A. 1., and as a
result they are raising the genetic
quality of their herds more rapidly than
is possible through natural breeding.
For instance, in 1964 nearly 50,000
cows, including some beef breeds, were
inseminated in Queensland alone; until
comparatively recently this was one of
the more backward States in this
regard.
Back in India, where sacred cows are
a stupefying problem, a birth-control
program has been instituted for them.
Early reports indicate that it is off to a
good start, though even if it is oper-
ated rigorously and energetically it will
take some years to have a noticeable
effect. India has more cows than any
other country on earth. Including water
buffaloes, which, incidentally, provide
most of India’s milk supply, the cattle
population is thought to be around
300 million. A religious conviction of
the Hindus does not allow cows to be
slaughtered or sold, but artificial birth
control, though it seems inconsistent
with the religious beliefs, may be prac-
tised on them.
The method of population control
now being launched is based on an
adaptation of the contraceptive loop de-
vised a few years ago by the American
J. Lippes for human use. Western agri-
cultural scientists working in India have
made a bigger model of this cheap plas-
tic loop and shown that when one is
inserted in each horn of a cow’s uterus
she is effectively sterilised. Local
Indians are now being trained in the
technique of installing these loops. The
operation requires about the same skill
as performing an artificial insemination,
but takes rather more time. However,
labor is something India has plenty of,
and the total cost of treating each cow
appears to be in the vicinity of ten
cents. The Federal Government has
requested all States to participate in
the scheme and has strong hopes that
it will eventually be highly successful.

SPECULATORS DIARY
All the Way with TNT
It's more than "I'm just a truckie."
WHEN Mr. Ken Thomas said “I’m just a truckie,” it must have been the
understatement of the week. Thomas Nationwide Transport describes
exactly what the company is—a national transport company headed by
Mr. Ken Thomas. (Contrast the name with National Consolidated and try to
work out what they do!)
The latest development on the Trans-
port Development Group’s proposed
takeover of TNT is the delay in ap-
proval of the scheme by the Govern-
ment. The market has not taken too
kindly to this news and the shares are
now some 30 cents below their peak
of $1.63 just a few weeks back. In
fact, at $1.32, they’re only just above
their pre-takeover price. Consequently,
even if the takeover does fall through
altogether, there should not be too
much change in this latest price. On
the other hand, if our Ministerial
father-to-be relents, then the market
should leap 25 percent.
It seems to be a week of compari-
sons, as TNT presents an interesting
contrast to that other company of the
mbment, Cottees. But the risk involved
in buying Cottees at this stage is very
much greater. If we assume that you
did buy Cottees on the present market
at $3.95, and the takeover was suc-
cessful, you’d show a 12| percent
profit. But if luck turned the other way
and the offer fell through, you’re in
for a 30 percent loss.
All this adds *up to the fact that I
prefer TNT to Cottees. The portfolio
already has 200 TNT at $1.53 and
this week I averaged down with
another 200 at $1.33. “All the way
with TNT,” you might say.
This made only a small dent in my
credit balance, so I immediately swung
on to another purchase this time
500 Waltons 1966 notes at $1.13.
If any company has come in for a
barrage of ill-founded criticism over
the years (most recently from Mel-
bourne), it is this one. Yet not only
has it been able to survive the attacks
but it has emerged with one of the
strongest banking connections in the
world. The First National City Bank
of New York is one of the largest and
perhaps the most enterprising banks
in the United States.
Strangely enough, it is the Mel-
bourne market that has led the share
price rise in the past few weeks. Just
changing sides of the fence, I suppose.
It is traditional for the few con-
vertible notes that are still quoted on
the markets to lag behind the prices
of their respective shares. Waltons
notes are no exception. Due to con-
vert into ordinary shares at the end
of this month, and with only just over
one cent difference in the income, the
notes are a much more attractive pro-
position at $1.13 than the shares at
$1.20.
In these days, the diary would al-
most look unfinished if it did not
trade in a mining stock. Peko Wallsend
is no stranger to the portfolio, although
this time it comes in at a price far
higher than on any previous occasion.
Two significant developments since the
last purchase and resale have been the
100 percent jump in gold production
at the Peko mines and the 300 percent
profit increase by the 50 percent owned
Rutile and Zircon Mines (Newcastle)
Ltd. If Peko is doing as well on the
copper and coal fronts as it is with
gold and rutile, then a spectacular
result must be in the offing.
shares have been steady around
$2.45 for some time, but, with vol-
ume now creeping in, a move up to
$2.80 is not out of the question.
On the selling side of the ledger
was Steel Mills and Advance Industries.
A mixed result with Steel Mills, show-
ing a profit of $4O, but Advance In-
dustries proved only a break-even pro-
position. Steel Mills should turn in its
best year ever, yet the market is not
likely to go very much higher than it
is now. As for Advance Industries —
well, just not enough advance. It seems
to have become one of the market’s
forgotten stocks. As such, there seems
little point in retaining it in the port-
folio at this stage.

Solid, silent luxury-powered by Ford
New Ford Galaxie 500
The new Galaxie 500 is the most impressive new Ford ever
built.
Styling is classic, sleek, unquestionably aristocratic.
The luxury of its interior and abundance of its convenience
items establish it instantly as a pace-setter among prestige cars.
Its performance is so smooth and quiet even a whisper can be
heard at highway limits. Power steering is precise in traffic,
easy in parking. Power brakes are self-adjusting. A massive
“Torque-box” frame and four-wheel coil suspension give the
car an incredible steadiness under all driving conditions.
And, there’s the agile responsiveness of Galaxie’s 200 horse-
power “Challenger” VB, or the optional 280 horsepower
“Thunderbird” VB, both teamed with dual-range Cruise-O-
Matic transmission.
Drive the new Galaxie 500 soon, and discover the new standard
of the fine-car field ... at your Ford Dealer’s.
