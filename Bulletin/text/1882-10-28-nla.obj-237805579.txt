The Question of the Day.
a position that it has to fight population for the
soil foot by foot.
* * *
This paradox has not escaped public attention.
Almost all people agree that our method is un-
satisfactory, but the evils of the present time have
rarely been concisely stated, and the changes that
should be wrought by legislation have been very
vaguely glanced at. Of sounding aphorisms wo
get enough, at times, in the “House” and else-
where. We hear plenty about “agriculture,” “pas-
toral interests,” “capital,” and “ our immense re-
sources,” but the whole are treated with a misty
incoherenoy. Even John Stuart Mill’s
economic teachings would be misapplied if not
directed by knowledge of existing facts; so no
wonder that both our legislators and their critics
ai e often at fault. There is only one way to get a
grip of the subject: That is to begin at the begin-
ning, and ask questions such as—“ What are these
lands ?” “What have we done with them P” and
“ What do we want to do with them ?” No answer
to any of these questions can be got from public
documents. No member of the Assembly could
answer all of them—few could answer even one.
Moreover, few men know less, except on some
minute personal points, than a majority of the
tenants in possession, the squatters and selectors.
No more can the Press pretend to speak with
absolute knowledge—but it is the business of the
journalist to collect the facts bearing on public
topics, and present the same, so as to lead the
mind of the community to reason soundly.
* * «
To the first question then : “ What are these
lands?” we answer: One half of the surface of
New South Wales is a waterle ss grassy waste—but
is capable of being made highly productive and
suitable for prosperous settlement under a
secure tenure. The remaining half is country
partaking ot the character of Spain and Italy,
The discussion now commencing will not be limited
to the consideration of the Consolidated Act intro-
duced on Thursday week. Whatever the Assembly
may do with that measure, in its further progress,
the patience of the people of New South Wales has
been too severely tried to be satisfied with any
remedy that does not go to the root of our agrarian
troubles. The public see every day more clearly
that our method of regulating the disposal of the
territory answers very few of the purposes either
of industry or colonisation, while abuses without
number, fostering political corruption, litigation,
and many spurious forms ot traffic, infest and
hamper the whole community. If evidence were
wanted to prove the effetenoas of the system, in
addition to what is observed daily, the late census
supplies figures showing a strange distribution of
our people. These statistics have been more than
once quoted already, but they cannot be repeated
often enough as long as the ominous facts which
they indicate are not taken in by those most con-
cerned. The whole population of the colony last
year was 751,468.
Of these, there lived in the metropolis, 224,211
in towns existing before 1871, 153,539J
in towns and villages formed
since 1871 61,792
Total inside towns and villages, 439,542
Total outside towns, including
miners, navvies, surveyors’
staffs, &o 311,926
Which means that the town and village population
count 58.5 per cent, of the whole ; the population
outside towns and villages only 41.5 per cent.
• • •
To comprehend duly the meaning of these figures,
it may be well to compare our position in this
respect with that of other countries similarly
situated. In the United States, there is at present
observed with dissatisfaction a concentration in
the towns, but the proportions are still of country
population to that of the towns as 10 to 2. In
the Dominion of Canada, with a population double
the whole of Australasia, the chief town is
about half the size of Sydney and Melbourne,
and the rural population is greater than in
the United States. Briefly, in the States and
Dominion, 84 per cent, of the people are in the
country, and only 16 per cent, in the towns ;
while, in New South Wales, wo have about 41 per
cent, in the country, and 59 per cent, in the towns
and villages. This disposition among us, to
urban concentration, is brought out more clearly
by what is shown of the distribution of the in-
crease during the ten years. The increase for the
period was, by the census, 247,487.
Of these, there live in Sydney and subqrbs, 89,464
in towns existing befere 1871, 52,261
in towns and villages opened
since 1871, 61,792
Leaving for those outside the streets and
slums, ... ... 44,010
A number equal to half the increase of Sydney,
only, went on to the land during the decennial!
• • •
Putting aside the obvious social and political
objections to such a state of things, the question
of how such masses of towns-people are fed con-
fronts us. Plainly, they do not derive their sup-
port from the use of the soil, and certainly they do
not live by manufactures or we would know some-
thing about what those manufactures are. There
are some mining villages, certainly, but of the
miners three-fourths live in camps. There is no
way to explain how these people are supported
but one. Some few of them may have other
resources, but the vast majority live from hand to
mouth, and are kept undoubtedly on public
money. There is no getting away from this start-
ling fact, that three-fifths of the people are not
supported by any productive industry, but that
they must live either on realised property, on
public works, on taxes paid by the other two-
fifths, or on the waste of the public resources.
Here is an enigma in the history of a community
not yet a century old! In every new country out
of Australia the reclamation of the indigenous
forest and plain provides the field for the benefi-
cial absorption of population ; people find their
homes on the broad wastes where all are welcome ;
the soil provides the best savings-bank for their
earnings, and industry and settlement advance
with a wide front, shoulder to shoulder. The
profitable use of the soil across the Pacific
harmonises with the spread of population, while
every new hand aids in the extension of enter-
prise, and in enlarging the field of national wealth.
It ia otherwise here. Our chief industry is in such
and suitable for such methods of using the
soil as are practised in those countries, and under
similar climates.” The second question, “ What
have we done with them ?' ’ we answer as follows :—
Practically, we |have done almost nothing with
them yet. Nature has done a good deal for us, in
spite of all the laws we have made: for our laws
have been mainly framed to prevent certain
persona and classes turning the soil to use. As
the result, we have a thoroughly bad grazing
■ system, and no method of farming whatever has
yet been worked out. 'J he first fact is known to
all who have dealings in stock and stations ; the
other can be learned by going for a few hours out
of Sydney by railway and looking about. Our
grazing system is in many cases as good as the
law will allow, but the wretched farce of waste,
sloth, and starvation of stock, miscalled “ farm-
ing " in New Syuth Wales, needs only to be seen
to turn any real farmer sick. The Land law is
certainly not responsible for this last result. What
is done elsewhere in a dry climate might also be
done here. But, it is more than probable that
unwise legislation has robbed many of our people,
including those who call themselves “ farmers ”
of the habit of industry and self-help. “ What
we have done with the lands” in the light of
public policy, is best shown by pointing out the
prominent evils of the present law. The chief
objections to the existing system then we specify
thus 1. The State has abandoned the duty of
disposing of the public estate. No new-comers,
either moneyed immigrants, or those of a working*
farmer class, can get land in New South Wales.
A deputation representing a large body of English
farmers came here two years ago to procure a
tract of country for settlement. They possessed
among them a large capital, and proposed to bring
their families and households wholesale. They
could get nothing here owing to the law. They
wont to New Zealand, and were provided for
readily. No one but a squatter or selector
knowing the run of the ropes,” with a
land agent at his back, can get land in
this colony. He may get a case before a land-
court, or a law-suit, but ho has little chance of
getting a farm. 2. The territory is abandoned to
be fought for by two factions. In the first place
the whole pastoral area, right to the Western
boundary, was handed over under lease to
squatters, and then the Act of 1861 empowered
the selectors to seize these lands in any way they
thought fit. The fight between the two classes
has gone on for twenty years. They injure and
ruin each other. The work of both is retarded,
misdirected, and hampered with expenses, with
the frequent result that the country in great
slices is falling into the hands of financing com*
paniea and syndicates, squatters and selectors
alike disappearing 1 . A vast deal of money is made
through disreputable practices prompted by the
law, but honest industry and wholesome settle-
ment alike go to the wall in the conflict between
squatter and selector. 3. People say daily, with
bated breath, that vested interests nave grown up
that cannot bo meddled with, and tL.t 5 any change
in the law is not desirable. This is the foulest
blot on the whole system. These “vested inter-
ests ” are the interests of land-pirates, black-
mailers, Members of Parliament earning money as
land-agents, and legal and political jobbers. An
immense deal of| questionable business from which
large profits are derived, has been built up on the
vices of our land system. To speak of such
abuses _ as claiming any prescriptive sanction or
immunity from honest reform is a perversion of
common sense. Such “ vested interests ” want
rubbing out, and when they are abolished, the
Assembly will have some dozens more of decent
members.
• • *
The third question, “ What do we want to do
with the lands ?” will be answered in various
ways by the parties directly interested. The
Parliamentary agents and black-mailers will be
sure to answer first : they will maintain the
thorough soundness of .the law, and will want to
keep things-, as' are. The selectors will' aay,
“ Give us er to harass and stamp out
the squatters, aLlS for the rest let thiugs be as
they ejre.” The squatter’will say,-“ Abolish free
selection, and we are content'with the rest.”
But the final decision will really rest, not with
any of the parties or with the whole combined,
but with the people of New South Wales. In
regard to the political agents and land sharks, the
award of the public should be this : “ That law
must be a miserable one which has stirred up the
filth of intrigue and pettifogging in which yon
have, lived. We shall abolish the law and you
also.” In regard to the second party, the public
may well ask the selector: “ What has he done to
justify him in asking for increased rights of
encroachment. Has he lived on and cultivated
the land that he got, or has ho quite as often used
the privilege of selection for corrupt ends ?’ * To
the squatter, the answer might fairly be this:
“You wish to abolish the selector and keep things
otherwise as they are. On what grounds do you
make this claim on the lands of the colony ? You
say ‘your country is a desert; that stock can
only be kept on it by going to enormous expense.’
When you offer a run for sale, you do-not call it a
desert. Moreover, if it is more fit for grazing
than for any other purpose, is that any reason
why you should ask for a perpetual tenancy to
yourself P Do you aim chiefly at making the most
of both land and stock, or is it not the case that
you mean to sell out the first good chance you
get, and take your money out of the colony ? We
acknowledge the justice of your complaint of
insecurity of tenure, but we deny your right to a
monopoly. The facts adduced by you in support
of your case point more to a safe tenure on much
smaller holdings as a sound grazing policy, and
we would value you much more if you were more
of a sheep farmer, and less of a station dealer.
As to your talk about capital, that is all nonsense.
With a good tenure, the money is always to be
got. Bankers don’t prefer huge straggling in-
secure holdings to others that are safer and more
compact.”
• * •
The welfare of the colony is concerned in deal-
ing fairly with all interests, in yielding to none—
The Iclaims of squatters and selector, equally,
which have accrued under the law, should be
finally dealt with, so that no cause of discord may
arise from the past. As to the future, when a
system is so thoroughly bad as that we are living
under, reconstruction is impossible and abolition
is the only course. Legislation for the public good
should be directed to stop discord, then to recover
as much of the territory as can possibly be dis-
entangled from present complications; lastly, to
give deliberate consideration to the framing of a
measure that will make the interests of the people
harmonise with the use of the country according
to its natural capabilities.

mr, Knox and “Contempt.”
In passing the clause introduced by Mr. William
Foester in the Criminal Law Consolidation Bill, on
Thursday last, the Assembly did well. It does not
matter whether the Courts of Record, as Mr. Wisdom
says, have or have not usurped a function not originally
theirs in presuming to inflict either fine or imprison-
ment for that offence which is vaguely termed “ con-
tempt of court.” It is quite sufficiently had that any
court has been allowed to hold so drastic a power—by
no means a hrutum fulmen, as we may see in the new
historic case where the then Puisne Judge and the
Chief Justice “stood by” a brother Judge as against
the Evening News. Mr. Geoese Knox in a remark-
able letter, on Friday, censured the action of the

Attorney-General in accepting the clause, and of the
Assembly in passing it, in very straight style. What is
the substance of Mr. Knox’s complaint ? That by
depriving the Judges of their excessive power, we de
prive the courts of the most effective means of ensuring
compliance with their orders and decrees; and we
in effest abolish Equity, whose procedure depends upon
the exercise of that power. As to the last objection,
we are by no means sure that the Court of Equity is
worth retaining. And, as to the first, wo say let con-
tempt be made a distinct offence —let its degree be mea-
sured and be proportionately punished; but let us not
have any man who, by the favour of a strong Govern-
ment, is made a Judge, endowed with this immense and
undefined power of fettering the Press, of gagging pub-
lie opinion, and of harassing private persons who dare
to find fault, all of which we have seen done in New
South Wales under the shield of punishment of “ con-
tempt.” So far Mr. Knox ; and let him know that, if
his brother barristers will forgive his departure from
the “ traditions of the profession,” the public will not
forget that he has set himself to defend that system
under which a man may be condemned at the will of a
Judge to pay a ruinous fine for speaking his mind*
There are signs that the well-kept preserve of the law
is not so zealously cared for as it used to be. Wednes-
day night witnessed a rare breach, in spite of Mr.
Slattery. But, it behoves the advocates of the new
order of things to watch carefully lest the lawyers and
fogies of the other Chamber do not destroy the work.

Some time since, the tram-cars were in the habit of
“ sticking up," while ascending the Liverpool street
incline. It happened one day that a respectable
citizen (who cn more than one occasion had had to get
out of the cars and walk home, after paying the Govern-
ment to take him there) was asked for his tram-ticket
by a guard. As the cars had just “jibbed," and the
respectable citizen did not care about being again vic-
timised, he told the guard that he’d pay when he got
to the top of the hill. But when they “ got to the top
of the hill*’ the guard called a policeman, and gave into
custody the respectable citizen, notwithstanding that
the latter tendered to him his fare, in the shape of a
ticket bought before the journey was commenced. The
citizen was locked np. He was subsequently bailed
out. Then he was summoned, but the Bench disagreed
and he was discharged, He took steps to enter an
action against the Eailway Department for false im-
prisonment. He has now been advised to abandon the
action. Here is his little hill of costs: —

The Tamworth Observer says it was a “ cruel injus-
tice” to remand to next assizes Miss Milbra Nott,
charged with the murder of her lover. “ The unfor-
tunate girl,” writes the Observer, “ must be cruelly
punished for six months, at the end of which time, it is
possible the jury may find a verdict of justifiable homi-
cide, or even not guilty. And then what recompense
will that marvellous institution, the Law, make to this
unfortunate!?" As the charming and amiable Milbra
admits having deliberately knifed her man, who was
neither a bushranger nor a burglar, we don’t
see how even nn Armidale or a Tamworth jury
could find a verdict either of “not guilty” or
“justifiable homicide." If a man had coolly in-
serted seven inches of cold steel under Milbra’s
fifth rib, the hangman would at once have heen howled
for hy all the papers In the district. Men and women
live under the same law. If Mr. Buchanan really
thinks that actions for breach of promise should be
abolished in favour of carving-knives the sooner he
brings in a bill to that effect the better. The Goddess
of Justice is, in N.S. Wales, a god, and has eyes—for
a pretty girl. But, of course, this has nothing what-
ever to do with the question whether or not the trial
of sweet Milaka should he unnecessarily postponed for
six months.

Willie Beckwith and James Finney swam for the
one-mile championship and a stake of £100 on the 28cn
August at Houingworth, near Rockdale. The course,
which was marked out with buoys, was 220 yards out,
so that the men had to cover eight laps to complete the
mile. When about 100 yards had been covered, Finney
drew ahead. Beckwith, making the turn, took Finney’s
water, and some boats in the vicinity gave the latter
their Backwash, practically putting him out of the race,
as Beckwith forged ahead, and won by twenty yards, in
30 min. 30-i sec. Finney protested, but the referee de-
cided to reserve his decision.
Gleaning from the remarks made by the English
papers anono the great cricket; match, we have come to
tne conclusion that the English batsmen were so funky
that they were afraid to punish the loose balls which
they must have got The bowlers were
allowed to experimentalise with impunity, and, when
a trundler like Bpofforth is let off m that manner, he
becomes “snakes." We have him mow down
wickets here on many occasions when the batsmen were
out before they weut in. We never see bowlers try
their different breaks while Mossie is about; they bewl
their level bast then.
As the match, Australians v. Kent, was finished
before time expired on tne third day, a scratch match
was arranged between two teams known as ’The World
and The Band of Brothers. Ob the side of the former
were Murdoch, Massie, Palmer, Bonnor, Jouea, F.
Lipsoombe, and the professionals G. Hsarn and
Wootton, besides one or two. lesser lights Tne World
went in first, and put together 303, of whica (Sammy
Jones made 100, It will be remembered that he made
59 against Kent, and bis innings, according to some of
the English papers, was the best played on the Aus-
tralian side. Tne Baud of Brothers was composed of
well-known county cricketers, and whan stumps were
drawn they had scored 51 without the loss of a wicket.
Notwithstanding the rain, the North Shore
Rowing Club successfully held their regatta on Satur-
day, in Careening; Cove. The ferry steamer Wallaby
served as flagship, and was well patronised, several
ladies being on board. The maiden sculls, in club skiffs,
was won by a length by Alderton, Crowley rowing a
good second. The race for maiden oarsmen, four oars
in string-test gigs, was wen by the Creswiek. The man-
of-war race, five-oared gigs, was the race of the day. Six
boats entered, four representing the Nelson, and two
the Espiegle. Nelson Nos. 3,4, and 2 secured the first,
second, and third prize?. No. 3 winning by a length.
The maiden double sculls race, in club skiffs, was a
well-contested race throughout, the Ada winning by
about two lengths, Nellie being three or four lengths
awav from Edith. Three crews started lor the scratch
fours, in string-test gigs. A good race took place, the
Willoughby eventually winning by two lengths, Victoria
being second, and St. Leonards nowhere.
The bicycling contests were commenced on
Saturday afternoon, at the Exhibition Building, but,
doubtless through the wet weather, the attendance was
not large. Following are the results of the contests on
SaturdayThree-mile race: C. Thorley 1; T. H. Chap-
man (200 yards) 2; time, 14 min. 3 4-10 sec. Amateur

Thorley and Master Herbert Eolfe, which was received
with great applause. On Monday morning the pro-
fessionals started on their six days' journey, twelve
hours each day, the tournament to conclude on Satur-
day evening about 11 p.m.

Ballade of Autumn.
(FOR THE BULLETIN).
The waning woods are sere and brown,
And wailing like our Northern sea;
The wrinkled leaves are flattering down.
And drifted over lawn and lea.
Pale amber lights flush sward and tree,
Fast-fading bars of golden grey
Athwart the sun—by two, by three—
And slow the daylight dies away.
And now along the paling west.
In lucent breadths of violet sky,
The clouds, like islands of the blest,
In faery seas becalmed lie.
Autuam is Summer’s fend goed-bye
(Ah, who may bid the green year stay!)
Comes Autumn with a tender sigh—
And slow the daylight dies away.
On uplands bare, where winds blow chill.
The shivering flocks no longer roam ;
The shepherd brings them from the hill
To sheltered pastures nearer home.
With muffled feet doth twilight come.
Trailing her robes of ashen grey.
Or yet thie harvest moon hath clomb—
And slow the daylight dies away.
ENVOI.
Sweetheart, ’tis Autumn with us now.
We who remember frolic May ;
With paler lights the hill-tops glow—
And slow the daylight dies away.

ONE OP THE WORLD’S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
IN a recent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Trickett, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following as his opinion.
•* I have found St, JACOB’S OIL a sure and certain
core, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in back, brought on by over-ex-
ertion in rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without farther trouble.**
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what he was talking about; and now he says
that St. JACOB'S OIL and good athletic training, ar
what all our young men want.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
According to Figaro, Sir Hercules "Robinson is
about to resign hia duties in the Colonial Office,
The Tichborne claimant will, in two years, be
released from gaol. His steadfast friend, the late Mr.
Guildford Onslow, who spent over £15,000 in aiding
Orton, has left a considerable legaey to the latter’s
wife.
The Prince of Wales having become too fat—
having in fact shown a disposition to imitate in point of
rotundity that “fat boy” whom Bean Brummell quizzed
on the stairs of Almack’g—has gone to Germany to
“ take the waters.”
In Egypt in a hand-to-hand encounter between an
Arab trooper and an English Life Guardsman, the latter
did a feat which is often shown on the bodies of inoffen-
sive sheep at an assanlt-at-arms, and cut his antagonist
clean in two at one stroke.
A man got a divorce from his wife in London
not long ago—the trial being, with the usual details,
quite a cause cildhre. Three davs after the decree nisi
had been pronounced, both of them got married. iThat
would not be strange but for the fact that they got
married to each other.
M. Blanc, erst of Monaco, is dead. Madlle.
Blanc (Princess Bonaparte) has just died, and Madame
Blanc is said to be dying . Formerly, the people who
lost “their little bit of gilt," used to Blank the
Blancs; but now soon there’ll be no more Biancs to
blank.
A pretty girl gave Cetewayo a locket at Ply-
mouth. This rather surprised him, as he couldn’t
make out how to find the place where the snuff went
in; but what staggered him most was the artistically
boiled shirt that awaited him on his arrival. Whsn
enjamille the King dined but no I
Henniker Heaton is on board the "R.M.S.
Peshawar, and cables to the Nooze an account of the
collision at Galle between that steamer and a barque.
" The Australian ladies on board the Peshawur showed
great courage.” This is thoroughly Hemrkerian. We
wonder whether any of the gentlemen took refuge
behind their skirts ?
Mr. Matthew Arnold, the “apostle of sweetness
and light,” thinks of visiting, not Australia, but America,
on a lecturing tonr. A home paper says there can be
no doubt of hia reception in the States; for, in strict
accordance with the old limitation of a prophet’s fame,
Mr. Arnold found a hearing across the Atlantic long
before he won it among his own ungrateful country-
men.
The “Vag.” has instructed his solicitors to
enter an action (D.Y. or otherwise) against the pro-
prietors of the Melbourne Agb, for a libellous attack on
his drama, “No Mercy.” Damages are laid at £10,000,
but we fancv Julian would knock a little off if it were
at once made a cash transaction. We strongly recom-
mend David Syme to write the “Yag.” a cheque for
£9950 and costa.
It is now said that “ the Prince of Wales never
volunteered, as some of the papers have stated, to go to
Egypt with the expedition.” We are sorry to hear
this lugubrious rumour. However, we suppose the
run on danger-preventives for the other Eoyal warriors
prevented the Prince going to Alexandria to drink
lemon-kali in defence of hia bleeding country. This is
a pity, as we have reason to believe that His Eoyal
Highness would have proved himself exceedingly
intrepid at drinking lemon-kali.
“ It is reported that a certain well-known gentle-
man, the reputed owner hitherto of wealth unteld, is in
reality nothing but a ‘ bogus capitalist,’ as the world at
large is shortly destined to discover to its cost and
amazement. This man of-straw has for the last two
years been entertaining • all London’ in a manner right
royal, and his open-handed hospitality has been equally
renowned in at least two county neighbourhoods. Start-
ling revelations are promised.” Surely this can’t be
but no.
Oscar Wild© has been treating the ladies at
Long Branch to a new revelation of the Beautiful. At
his last lecture, it seems that “ about 200 dollars’ worth
of antique lace encircled his neck, and was caught at
the throat with a diamond.” He also wore a velvet
basque “ with rich ruffled lace bursting like clusters of
blooming white roses from his sleeves.” This is all the
synopsis of bis lecture that is given, but no doubt he
used his rnffles to “old point” his moral as well as
adorn his neck.
There is little or nothing now heard of Mr. H.
M. Stanley, the African explorer, who seems to have
broken with all the English journals He has settled
down into a steady-going trader, a founder of depots
and stations, and a pioneer of commercial establish-
ments. He is now busy carrying on the work entrusted
to him by the King of the Belgians ; and has success-
fully established a chain of trading stations from the
mouth of the Congo as far up the river as the Uogonda
territory.
The mastoid muscle taken from Guitean’s body,
and preserved in spirits of wine, adorns the study of a
celebrated New York physician. His skeleton, bleached
and beautifullv articulated, is to be seen in the hall of
the Medical Museum of Washington, while his heart is
kept as a relic by a doctor in the same city. His skull,
it was cabled the other day, has been stolen. But this
is a way the dailies have of re-hashing old nows. Every-
one knows that Guiteau lost his head long before ho
met with the accident which caused his death.
“No person could he more emphatic in pro-
nunciation ; and his ear is as readily offended, if a word
be shorn of its due power, as a great musician’s by dis-
cordant sounds, or a painter’s eye by false colouring ;
and I e does not allow the forms of society to stand in
the way of giving very free expression to his annoy-
ance.” Thus The World in 1889, regarding Alfred
Tennyson. The evidence of Sir Henry Parkes as to
the length Alf would go, would be interesting. The
foregoing fact, no doubt, accounts for the short stay of
the Premier with the Poet.
Hia acceptance of the Postmaster-Generalship
killed Mr. Stephen Campbell Brown. Mr. Brown used
to toil hard at his professional duties, and then, when
he returned home late at night completely fagged out,
he would, invariably, find a heap of telegraphic papers
as high as a load of wool waiting for his “ best atten-
tion." Then he would sit down and work out answers
to the lot, after which it was almost time for him to
be in town again, plunged deep in business. So Nature
rebelled; and Stephen Campbell Brown is no more.
A young couple lately levanted from Sydney to
Auckland, under an assumed name, the lady leaving a
husband and family behind her. The machinery of the
law was put into operation, and the runaway, accom-
panied by her mother, returned not long since. The
gay Lothario is shortly expected to be in receipt of a
considerable sum of money from England. He is un-
married, and resided in Sydney for some time prior to
the elopement. His relations with the wife previous
to their flight caused great annoyance to the husband,
and a very large amount of domestic trouble.
The gentleman who accepted the commission
to bang tbe Irish murderer, Hynes, at Cork, is a
Primitive Methodist Yorkshire local preacher. The
combination of preacher and hangman is an odd one—
almost as odd as that of Salvation Army captain and
swindler. The local Methody preacher, however, is
said to bo a real good fellow, clever with the rope,
ready with the text, and a first-class cobbler into the
bargain. It is understood that should Marwood ever
retire, the Methody preacher will be his successor to
the office ©f Jack Ketch.
It now seems to be pretty well settled that
Marie Stuart had blue eyes and red hair. It is well
known that she wore wigs of different colours, for most
of her portraits give her dark-brown hair. This is a
perfect crusher. In Sydney, every fat female beer-
seller, who is as big a fraud in the character of Hebe as
she would be in that of a monarch of any kind, per-
sistently shows up at public ball* as the ill-fated Queen
ot Soots. Poor Mary I she had her head chopped off in
the long ago. She is constantly being publicly person-
ated by vendors of porter-gaff and gin-and-peppermint;
and now they’ve found out that she was “ carrotty !”
“Here,” remarked M. Paatenr, the distin-
guished scientist, to a visitor, “ you may see cocks,
hens, guinea-pigs, hares, mice, and monkeys, to whom
I have communicated all the grave maladies which
might prove epidemic, so that I may study these di-
seases in two er three phases and find antidotes, or at
least derivatives, to use against them. In this little
cabinet near by you will see about a thousand small
vials. They contain all the germs, or tha virus, of
terrible maladies. Here (said the great man, with a
smile) is enough to slay all Paris, and to bring into
being the most murderous epidemics. I have to keep
up a regular Turkish bath temperature here to preserve
all these germs in good condition." The visitor peeped
inte the cabinet, with his handkerchief carefully
pressed to his nose, but the odour was so strong that
he was not sorry to get out of the door into the green
little garden close to the laboratory.
The Wesleyans at Windsor have a happy vein
of satire. When Maclean endeavoured to bombard the
"August Lady" who considers the Bible to be the
“ secret of England’s greatness, England's glory,” he
was arrested by Police Superintendent Hayes, to whom
Her Majesty subsequently sent £5 by the under butler.
Well, the Windsor Wesleyaas, shortly after this, had
a tablet erected in their church to celebrate the Queen’s
glorious escape. And they voted just five pouads for
the tablet. There is not so much humour in the whole
of our Congregational Church as this—except on part of
the deacons when they allude to the “ voluntary offer-
ings" you make under the cynosure of 500 pairs of
threatening eyes.
There is a dreadful scandal at home right in the
centre of the swells—quite amongst the E. B.’s
and—whom shall we say?—of London. There is a
Marquis and a Marchioness of (say) A., and an hon.
Mr. and Honorable Mrs. B. Well, the Marquis fell
in love with Mrs. B., and Mr. B. got “shook ’’ on the
Marchioness. So the families have crossed over, and,
since no divorce nan be had now without interference
from the Queen’s Proctor, all four are resigned to their
fates ; and the most extraordinary part of the story is
that thev are the best of friends. All are about to pro-
ceed to America, where, of course, they will bs constant
in their attendance at the church of the Eev. Ward
Beecher.
“ The Vagabond ” says that Mr. Sachs helped
him with his play, “No Mercy.’’ Dampier gave him
some assistance too, it seems, and Paolo Giaccometti
is entitled to some slight acknowledgment at the Vag’s
hands, if only as the author of “Li Morte Civile!’’
However, Mr. Sachs is credited with inventing Charles
Eeade’s blackfellow, so all honour bs to him Mr. S.
is the man, by-the-way, whom Julian describes as hav.
ing shot jam pots off his head in Northern Queensland.
Mr. Sacha, when about to fire, requested “the Vaga-
bond ” to hold the tin in his hand. But Julian decide >1
that it would be more conducive to his personal safety
to hold it on his bead.
Queen Victoria has several crowns, one of which
she wears in the winter, another in the summer, and
a third, which is the oldest and least valuable of the
three, is worn in rainy weather and when she is in the
misty Highlands. One time she always took her crown
to bed, so as to keep it safe from the servants, but she
changed that habit on account of an accident to Albert
one night. The Prince hid just said his prayers, and
blown the light out, when, as he was giving Vick her
good-night kiss, one of the points struck his face.
“ There you are again,” he snapped, “given me a black
eye, and they’ll think to-morrow I’ve had another row
with Palmerston. Confound you 1 ” So the Queea
always has it looked up in the plate chest, along with
the spoons.
Wheeler, the Californian Thug, has at last been
found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. He,the other
day, refused te allow the reporter of a ’Frisco daily
paper to interview him, whereupon the irate scribe
wrote a long report, ending thns :—“ Wheeler has
grown exceedingly corpulent, and this, added te his
Urge stature, will bring his weight to over 200 pounds.
His flesh is apparently soft, and in the execution he
will probably bo draws np instead of dropped, in order
to avoid tearing his head from his body, as has been
the case In several instances where the subjects were
heavy and had undergone long confinement.’’ “For
cheerful breakfast reading,*’ remarks another journal,
“we commend this paragraph to Mr. Wheeler, and
respectfully suggest that he clip it out and paste it in
his hat—or rather in the black cap.”
Crushed again ! Just as we were beginning
to like the Express, and to commend it for its admir-
able cooking recipes and brilliant flashes of humour,
here we see that the author of all this j cy has resigned ;
and now we shall no longer borrow the* Threepenny
Leonard when embowered in a mourning coach on our
way to the Necropolis. Mark this dread announcement
which appears in the Old Girl of Monday:—“ As I
have resigned my position as editor, printer, and pub-
lisher of the Express, I must request all persons having
business with that newspaper to address their communi-
cations to the editor, or manager, and not to me by
name.— John M. Dtjer.’’ Builders are now busy erect-
ing an editorial office for one of the clergy on the roof of
the palatial Clarence-street offices. The new editor
wishes to be as near to heaven as possible when writing
the paper
A writer in London Figaro, who visited Mrs.
Langtry, at her hotel, in Glasgow, at the close of a per-
formance, found her amid a perfect blaze of bouquets,
which had been showered on the stage and sent to her
room. As many of them were valuable hot-house
blooms they showed a very warm feeling. Mrs. Langtry
said her mother was e Scotchwoman, and her father,
the Dean, of French extraction; she spoke modestly
of being but a novice in her art, but was determined to
study very hard, adding that the splendid press notices
given her would not cause her efforts to relax, but act
as a stimulus to further exertion. Mrs. Langtry’s
photographs do her manifest injustice. Her animation
is wonderful; and of course, incapable of photographic
delineation. Yet her face is most impressive in moods
of repose. She has infinite power of pathetic expression;
a very beautiful suggestion of moral sweetness also,
and a simple, modest, girlish grace.
The gallant Colonel, H.R.H. Prince Leopold, is,
we regret to hear, considerably “ crooked” as regards
general vigour, but, he has withal, a “ morbid aversion
to be thought illand, therefore, the editors of the
Society lubricators have been, of late, further endan-
gering their chances of ultimate salvation by represent-
ing that the Prince has become a kind of Gohah, and
takes his Burton beer, and his Boast Beef of Old Eng.
land, in enormous quantities daily ; whereas the Duke
can only stand having spooned into him about half-a-
pint of infant’s food daily, and could not draw his sword
of slaughter to save —or rather let us sadly say, to
prolong—his martial existence. We read a lot about
the Duke of Albany now in the London papers, but we
don’t read anything about the Duchess. It seems that
the Princess has disagreed with the Prince, and that he
is now with the Queen at Osborne, trying another kind
of medicine. The general idea is that what the intrepid
Colonel ought to have married is a porous-plaster.
The Duke of Hamilton recently won >£45,000 at
Goodwood. Ho is, as is well-known, married to a
daughter of that gay old dog and all-round kisser of
pretty girls, the “Juke” of Manchester, who, by the
way, was once mistaken for a bushman 1 The Duke of
Hamilton is, and always has been, a terrific gambler,
but where he gets the bulge on most men is that he can
last the longest. We have seen him, when we had just
left off wearing little frilled trousers, playing roulette
at Homberg and Monaco, and he would stake the
“maximum” (£400) every time, and double if they
would let him. One day, he and a young Parisian
named de la Gharme arrived at Wiesbaden en route
tor somewhere, and. sitting down at the table#, naicl
they had just twenty minutes to break the bank. They
did it, well within time—winning £10 000 between them,
and went away as quietly as if nothing had happened.
The Duke has a splendid nerve, and used to demoralise
the croupiers, and arts had to be employed to divert his
attention These arts ware seductive, of course, since
few people won'd care to quarrel with a burly man of
6ft. 4in. The Dake is very kind-hearted, and, it is
rumoured, was once quite an adept at mastering word i
of three syllables.
The insolvency of the eminent Mr. Fred. Harvie-
Linklater. of Adelaide, barrister, late of Sydney, is a
puzzle. The assets lie over the liabilities— i e. t on
paper—for the summary of the estate reads Liabili-
ties, £284 14s. 3d.; assets, £397 17s. 4d. ; surplus,
£65 3s. Id. But then the chief item in the assets is
“book debts, £219 17s. 43,” —and just fanay any one
insane enough to pay an insolvent lawyer a book debt.
There seems to be trouble ahead for Harvie. J. H.
Symon, Q C , and Q wynne, are pressing 1 , on behalf of
the insolvent conspirator, William Forsyth, tor an
adjournment sine die, of the hearing in Linklater’s in-
solvency, which prayer, in Adelaide law, is equivalent
to expressing the beneficent hope that tue Com-
missioner, in his wisdom, will see fit to send the
insolvent to prison, forevertndeverames. Examina-
tions of the insolvent showed that Liakia had had
several streaks of good luck lately. There was the bag
of £1977 2s. 43. from the swindler, Forsyth, wh >
levanted and only came back when he heard his estate
was (being swallowed up. There were the sums of £50
won at the February, and £290 wou at the March rao?s ;
and there was tho remittance of £50 from England, in
March, also. Linklateris defended by or. bmith—who
has ever so many letters attached to his name, writes
“ The Bohemian ’’ in the Adelaide Eegister, and
delectable novels for the local weeklies, leaders for the
dailies, and the groaniest scientific humour for any-
thing and everything. What his merits as au insolvency
lawyer may be, time will show Prod. Harvie L , whom,
we expect, tho doctor has defended chiefly out of
camaraderie, becauss Harvie says he is himself a press-
man of the first water, has been several editors, and is
still the special (Adelaide) correspondent of tbe London
Era. Mr. Symon wanted to put in as evidence the
examination in chambers of Forsyth, but Dr. Smith
objected that he had had no opportunity to cross-
examine. So it was decided to take Forsyth's evidence
de novo, in the presence of Dr. Smith, and the hearing
was adjourned for three weeks, till when Oh, by the
way, the causa of Fred’s insolvency is, “pressure of
creditors ”
“Cupid” and the swells will be interested to
hear that Isabella, tbe ex-Queen of Spain, has left Paris
on a visit to Comillas. W uen she had been gone tome
little time, the wood-man, feeling uneasy, made en-
quiries, and found that Alfonso had broken up his
mother’s establishment, as he discovered that whenever
ho gave her the money for the milk and the butcher,
she used to squander it on hidden treasures. But, what
troubles the tradespeople most is that they can’t get
hold of her chamberlain, Marfori. He has gene, too.
He is a kind of Andalusian John Brown, and, conse-
quently, rather more so. He has been with Her
Majesty ever since her flight from Madrid. He is very
faithful, and a demon at sticking dp articles for the
Boyal household. But Alfonso does not like him some-
how. Perhaps, when the King of Spain was only Prince
of Anstrias, Marfori used to spank him. It we had ever
been rash enough to spank a King when ho was young,
we shouldn’t haunt him when he reigned. He might
serve us the same, then ; and no man could look digni-
fied while being spanked, even by a King.
The Earl of Berkely is juat dead. He wouldn’t
call himself the Earl of Berkely when living, notwith-
standing that the House of Lords had proclaimed his
brother illegitimate—bestowing upon him the title of
Earl dubbed him Earl as aforesaid.
It seems that the Earl of Berkely, his father, married a
pretty butcher’s daughter, named Mary Cole, but, with
the characteristic forgetfulness of the noble-born,
allowed her to live for four years at Berkely Castle
without telling people she was his wife, during which
period she gradually acquired rather a giddy reputation
in the county. In the end, the Earl married Mary over
again, and not being immortal, subsequently died. The
fact of the first marriage having taken place could not,
however, be proved, as the register was missing, so it
was decreed that only the children of the second mar-
riage were legitimate, and Mr- Moreton Pitzhardinge
was given, as we have said, the title. But he wouldn’t
—out of self-denying reverence for his mother’s name—
accept it. So he lived simple “ Moreton Fitzhardinge ’’
(attaining the age of 86) until the other day ; and during
the whole of his life consorted only with grooms and
gamekeepers—avoiding entirely the society of women.
Well, he’s dead now. And somehow we think, despite
anti-Smithian proclivities, that a splendid man is gone.
But then, doubtless, this is a sentimental day with us.

Poor old “ Professor” Guscott, of herbal re-
nown, has died at Auckland, N.Z. “ Physician, cure
thyself I" Mr. Edward Scovel, brother of pretty
May Fielding, the actress, is husband of the New York
heiress Marcia Boosevelt, and is said to be ene of the
handsomest men in the world, as well as a magnificent
singer. He only sings in private London salons, is dis-
tinguished in bearing, and has the manners of good
society Victor Hugo married his first cousin, Adela
Toucher, whereupon his brother, who was in love with
her, shot himself. Another brother died in a lunatic
asylum. Hugo’s eldest daughter was drowned in her
honeymoon, and her husband at once committed
suicide. His (Victor Hugo’s) eldest son fell dead in his
teens. The great novelist has now but one child, who
is a lunatic in a French asylum. She sits on his knee
and prattles plaintively about her “lost life," when he
visits her ; but the old man is too deaf to hear her.
These memories are the skeletons in Hugo’s home
How would this, from the 8.P. Newsletter, do in
Sydney P—“ When the Legislature changed the name
of William M. Hogg, of 302 Montgomery-street, to
William M. Hoag, they made a great mistake, for this
man has since shown himself Hogg by nature as well
as by name, as will soon be proven by an eminently
respectable lady of this city, who is abont to bring suit
for $100,000 damages, for defamation of character and
libel." By the way, we see that “ defamation of
character” and; “ libel" are two different things in
America, They are, really, not legally so in h.S.W.

in his bill, his joke was probably an expensive one.

A jademt or Music. —The Mastodon Minstrels xb.
In a recent preliminary notice of “ The Mas-
cotte," we stated that the dialogue was “of rather
a spicy sort ” Mr. H. E Harwood, being as aasthetic
as he is lovely, considers that the expression might be
misconstraed —as it implies that there are giddy lines in
the opera. Now, we want to smilingly tell Mr. Har-
wood that “ rather a spicy sort” is a quotation from
“ Martin Chuzzlewit," a novel by an author who, un-
fortunately for his future fame, never either adapted a
pantomime or translated a libretto. We used the ex-
pression in the same sens* as it was employed by
Bailey, junior, when enlightening the two Miss Peck-
sniffs as to the quality of their supper, which was then
cooking below, imparting to those sweet girls the addi-
tional information that Miss Todgers “ was a dodgin’
amongst the tender pieces with a fork, and a eatin’ of
’em.” Mr. Harwood will now see—bless him! —that we
were well withis our lines, Sand would be the last, thank
heaven ! to suggest that any French opera could be the
slightest bit ddcolleU before we had sten seen it. We,
who have praised everything, including the “ Forlorn
Hope” of Darrell (where are you, George ?) and the
Hamlet of Defries (Defries, dear boy, how we do long
to see you again in Hamlet),would not be guilty of any-
thing so dreadful. On the contrary. Since we prefer
as a rule, the perusal of French libretti to the pages
of the Protestant Manual, it is clear that whatever
may be said about the latter work, nothing whatever
can be urged against the severe chastity of the former
Bo— Vogue la galere.

The redoubtable Fred. W. Millia has returned
to Sydney from Queensland, whither he has been travel-
ling with the Greatest Moulton on Earth. Frederick
is getting, we hoar, a new Monologue Entertainment
done, and intends to give a private performance before
he starts for Western Australia next week. Millis is
quite a wonder in hia way. Besides being a capital
vocalist and entertainer, he can “ come ” the “ man on
the roof" and the “cat in the coal-hole” with any
ventriloquist we have ever heard. He is learning tho
•• cow in the woodyard,” and is nearly perfect in the
•• rat in the funnel." Besides this—which is really tip-
top—he can conjure [capitally. You lend him three
half-crowns, and —but, there! wait and see him. His
title is remarkable for its gentle, its melting modesty.'
On his bills we see “Fred. W. Millis, the King of
Ventriloquists." The entertainment he and Moulton
give is pleasingly novel. When they go into a town
•*The Greatest on Earth” tells all the lies he can think
of for two nights; and when he has exhausted himself,
Millis gives his “show,” which to judge from his
notices, must be—once again, Mr. Har wood 1— “of
rather a spicy sort."

Duncan Macullum is “in it” to some extent.
He is now manager of an Opera Company, having paid
W., G., and M. £1000 for the use of certain of their
operas, with the dresses and scenery. He takes Elsa
May, Howard Vernon (the inimitable Bnnthorne),
Madame Navaro (fancy, that lady and John Lucas both
in New Zealand!), Signor Tremaglia (as conductor),
and a full company of principals and chorus. The
venture is a very big one—involving some thonsands of
pounds—and we hope “ Mao.” will make the money we
would like him to do; in which ease he would be rich
enough to run a sarcastic paper, or give Dnbbo a taste
of the legitimate. The Company open at Abbott’s
Opera House, Auckland, which was recently enlarged
on the occasion of the distinguished N S. Wales politi-
clan alluded to above giving a command night. Offen-
bach’s “ Tambour Major ” will be the opening piece,
and it is to be mounted with great splendour Mr. H.
Vernon to play the title-role. It is believed by the
cognoscenti that he has “ got the hang ’’ of the part in a
very remarkable manner, in which case he will, of
oonrse, give us a taste of it when he returns. The last
Tambour-Major we had was always leaving hia voice at
the Hawkesbury or somewhere, and so marring a fine
performance. Let’s hope Mr. Vernon will nave better
lack with his. When singers leave their voices behind,
our interest in them moderates. By the same token,
when actresses have lost their teeth, we prefer them to
smile in private. We may be eccentric in these notions,
hut we hold them, nevertheless.

Miss Rosa Towers —what a name to sonnet to—
Towers, flowers, amorous powers, golden hours, rosy
bowers, and here is a “ throw in” for Edward Baly—
with her Comedy Company, opened in the Gaiety
Theatre on Saturday night. The company is a com-
pact little one. So was the house on the opening night.
“Truth,” the piece played, is a comedy by Bronson
Howard, and a very good comedy at that. The inci-
dents are natural, and the plot is developed without
having to call upon the services of any deus ex machina
or ghost from the other world to pull it through. Four
strong men —Mr Alfred Sterry (Frank Towers), Mr.
Frederick Fry (Frank Cates), Mr. John Penryn (G E.
Ireland), Sir Partridge Compton (J. G. Joyce), and
four weak women—Mrs Dorothy Sterry (Miss Emma
Bronton), Lady Compton (Miss May Vivian), Prudence
(Miss Nellie Playfair), and Patience (Miss Theresa
Horan), get into trouble together. Two of the strong
men are affianced to two of the weak women. The
whole detachment of men—husbands and lovers—go to
a fancy-dress hall one night, and inform the ladies
when they get home that they have been to the synod,
or a tea-meeting, or something of the sort. First lie.
The mother-in-law of Mr. Alfred Sterry, Mrs. Stone-
henge Tuttle (Mrs. Stammers), finds them out, and
informs the ladies. First crusher. Then the men lay
their heads together and explain their dancing with
giddy girls in shocking dresses, by the statement
that they were acting a charade at Mrs. M’Namara’s.
Second lie. Mrs. M’Namara arrives about this time,
and denies any knowledge of the affair. Second
crusher. Then the women go about in tears, anU the
men in misery, till Mrs. M’Namara (Miss Rosa Towers)
advises them to tell the truth and shame themselves.
They yield basely, and, of course, all is forgiven.
• * •
HWe have two faults to find with this drama. In
the first place, the writer has pandered to ancient
prejudice by getting rid of the mother-in-law in the
last act. We have no vested interests in mothers-in-
law, but we like to see them get a chance. They have
one consolation, however, if they have no chance on the
stage, they get all the chances off it. The next objec-
tion is, that, when the wicked men are eardoned, they
go off swearing that they will never offend again, and
lead the public to believe that they mean it. Now,
this may be art, hut it is not nature. The curtain
should drop on them concocting a new plan whereby
they can get away to another ball ten times wickeder
than the first. That is nature.
* • *
The acting is bo equal, and the parts so well
proportioned in this play, that really the best criticism
we can bestow upon it is not to criticise it at all, Tho
character taken by Miss Rosa Towers is not one wherein
she has any opportunity for display, but there is quite
enough colour in it to indicate what she can do when
Eut unon her metal. She is very pretty, and that is
alf the battle. And she speaks clearly, and without
affectation, which is nearly, but not quite, the other
half. We are very much pleased to iee such a nice
little company at the Gaiety. The scene, we might
mention, is very prettily set.
* * * *
Sere we go again ! “ Bill ” Eignold, George’s
brother, has just purchased “ The American” for Aus-
tralia, though it is not known whether or not he will
come over, or let his brother play it; but a piece of
"lore enthralling intelligence than this is that Miss
J mo has been playing “ East Lynne ’’ at Narandera
t er’s, the local paper intimates, was a Vine perform-
ance. but he don’t put it quite so neatly He says:
“ S-parklinr eyes of beauty were dimmed, <fcc., so power-
fully does Miss Juno draw upon the feelings of her sex,
in her poetic and beautiful representation of the roreiy
tried Lady Isabel; ” which leads us to the conc'usion
that Miss J. has een rash enough to settle her adver-
tising account By the bye, Miss Juno’s company was
the only one we have heard of as subscribing for that
good comedian, Johnny Hydes, who, after a life of hard
work and hard times has just died in poverty at Mel-
bourne.
That was, Elois°, we tell you true,
A sweet and gentle thing to do.
Your charity should bring you luck,
You never should, sweet one, get “ stuck,”
And have, when from a town a rusher.
To give the watchful landlord “brusher.”
Good luck you’ll have, dear, in all parts—
For angels watch o’er kindly hearts.

Mrs. Scott-Siddons is now reading to the Eng-
lish. She lately brought the usual action —this time
against the Messrs Gatti, of the London Adelphi, for
a trifling £15,000 —and Mr. James M’Mahon is still her
manager. Many years ago, when little Jimmy (who was
of a singularly youthful appearance) arrived in London
with Mrs. 8.—Captain Scott-Siddons having subsided—
a lady who called upon the actress said, alluding to
James : “ A very nice little fellow I Your little sou, I
presume ?” “ Oh, dear, no, he’s not my little son,” re-
plied Parthenia; “ he’s my little manager.” And
talking of pretty stars, we read in a New York paper
that Mrs. Langtry will have nothing to do with Mr.
Langtry, because he is a “mean-spirited little wretch ”
We don’t know why. Mdelle Th£o, the lovely French
prima donna (opera bouffe), has a husband also. He is
a tailor. But he only makes his wife’s clothes now,
and they are, it is said, such a good fit, that the more
clothes has on, the more she looks like Venus
Eising from the Sea, or Leda before the Swan had
arrived. But what naughty things people will say of
pretty actresses.

Jeanne Bernhardt, sister to Sarah, was playing
Cora in Sardou’s piece (our “ Diplomacy ’’) when, feel-
ing that she was making rather a hash of the part, she
took laudanum after the first act. She thought, by
doing this, to get up a romance. So she did. But the
romance vanished with the arrival of the stomach,
pump. And, glancing at a paper, we see that “EipVan
Winkle Jefferson ” has returned to the stage. At fare-
wells he is the American Coppin. By th» way, it is
almost time for George to come back now, isn’t it ?

In a notice of the tragic performance of Byron’s
sepulchral comedy, by the Loftus Amateurs, we stated
that Miss Myra Kemble’s performance was a “ hyste-
rieal gasp ” right through, and Miss Kemble thinks
that perhaps soma people might misconstrue the ex-
pression into an unfavourable comment. What we
intended to imply was, that she was so droll as Mary
Melrose that wo gasped hysterically all through the
piece—a proceeding we varied by weeping whenever
Sir Geoffrey remarked anything- We have not, by the
way, heard from Miss Myra what she is going to do.
She ought to do something big if she likes to take the
trouble —but it’s getting rather too hot, now, to take
any of that. 1 his weather we will take almost any-
thing—except trouble. But we forgot, since we prayed
for rain, we’re much cooler.

We hear a lot of things. First, that Alice Bees
goes to New Zealand on a six months’ engagement.
We trust to see her in excellent health when she returns.
Now, isn’t that nice of us ? —Oh, and Pattie Laverne is
back in London; which reminds us that Harry Jackson
has bought the Australasian right of the “Romany
Eye.” And we can’t come out without stating that
Mr. James (“TwoEoses”) Albery has produced another
new and entirely original comedy from the French,
which is a complete and triumphant failure at the
Criterion. Who has bought the Australasian right of
“Little Miss Muffett” (the real name of it) has not
transpired.—By the way, Emerson is playing at ’Frisco
—probably waiting for “LI” to trot over and fetch
him. —And this recalls to our remembrance that Ada
Ward’s mother died the other day at Chatham, aged 59.
Ada herself is 21—and has been so for the last 14 years.
—The new sensation in comic opera is to be “ Mademoi-
selle Clairon,” and the “ Fun in the Bristol” Company
at the London Olympic are a great success. All appli-
cations for orders they answer on deep black-edged note-
paper, and in terms as follows: — ‘ Owing to the limited
capacity of this theatre, and the extraordinary demand
of the libraries and paying public for boxes and seats,
the management is reluctantly compelled to decline
acceding to your request. T he marginal darkness which
surrounds this note but feebly expresses the grief we
feel at not being able to oblige you.” If there is any.
thing better than this in the piece, they can come out.

To-night “ The Mascotte.” It is being played
while the editor is grinding away at the double-demy,
and the staff is employed greasing the machinery. We
can’t give a notice of the opera, therefore, until next
week ;—but since Harwood plays the Duke in the piece,
we can —emulating the example of a distinguished
morning contemporary—predict a success beforehand.
But we couldn’t do this unless Mr. Harwood played
the Duke.

Oh, and the Pantomime! Well, it is to be
entirely original. The author’s name is at present
enshrouded in mystery, but we have seen, halt-hidden
in Williamson’s bosom, the portrait of a gentleman in
spectacles, whom we suspect to be the gifted librettist.
Mr. Williamson says it is advisable always to keep the
name of the pantomime secret; therefore, we would
not for the world hint that the title is to be the
“House that Jack Built.” We always like to carry
out the wishes of a wealthy and popular manager. Do
you see, we are honest critics, but we like champagne
and oysters.

The Niggers have been playing to pretty good
business at the Academy of Music during the past
week. But the crush will be when Billy Wilson’s great
work, “The Pirates of Pensunkles,” is produced.
Brackets are being fixed against the walls, and baskets
suspended from the roof, to accommodate those who
can t get anybody’s knee to sib on. It is also stated
that the chorus are now employed, after the perform-
ance is over, in digging a subterranean escape passage,
so that, in case the opera buffer goes crooked, those of
the performers who cannot hide in Billy Wilson’s
mouth may fly through it from the wrath of an in-
furiated audience. This is thoughtful, but premature.
The performance will go off right enough if the gifted
blackamoors will not read any more of Young’s “Night
Thoughts," and will let Mrs. Crow’s “Night Side of
Niture ’* alone. We believe Billy Wilson has been poring
over these works of late, for his mouth seems to ba
contracting, and his complexion, we can swear, is
several degrees paler than it used to ba. The purest
fun is purely thoughtless. Tha Niggers ought to bo
very fuuny.

The People’s Saturday Night Popular Concerts
are among the first things of their kind that justify
that title. They are! popular. This is from hearsay.
They are held at the Temperance Hall, but though we
have started a number of times for that home of
ancient peace, we have never succeeded in getting there.
Whatever there is about the place we can’t imagine,
but we have never been able to find it at night. We see,
however,, by the programme, that a quantity of songs
are sung during the evening by a quantity of people,
whose nam's our not knowing, without doubt, argues
ourselves unknown. But we can’t help it. We were
never in Naples, nor did we leave any unpaid sausage
scores behind us in Milan Gibing apart, though, we
belie ve that these entertainments are well worth seeing.
It is characteristic of us not to act up to our belief,
but this is one of the weaknesses of genius.

Our Adelaide correspondent writes ; —Wybert
Eseve’s company have been playing “ The Woman in
White ” and “ Stolen Kisses,” through the past week
to fair houses. The Misses Deorwyn have been engaged
as supports. “ The Colonel" will be played this week.
When D. H. Harkins produced this comedy, the Ade-
laide folks, who have abeut as much aestheticism as a
dog-leg fance, flocked in numbers to see and enjoy it.
It seems strange that the denizens of a land where the
wool-bale, the pass-book, and the pound-note are wor-
shipped in place of the sunflower, the lily, and the
dado, should take interest in this sort of thing. Yet it
is a fact. Though we have nothing in common with
Du Maurier, we can do more here with “ The Colonel ’’
than can the voluptuous and passS Melbournites Her-
bert Flemming is as lovely as ever. The Lynch Family
of Bellringers flourish at the Town Hall.

Bright-haired, bright-eyed Emelie Melville and
her company are drawing splendid audiences with the
“ Royal Middy,” at the Opera House. As this opera
has not been produced in Sydney before, we will warble
a boiled-down version of the plot. Ecoutez !
• • •
Lamberto loves a Queen,
The Queen she loves Lamberto ;
But, previously, he’d been
Engaged another fair to.
That fair one is Fanchette,
A little French soubrette.
Who wicked small parts plays
In the Framjaise.
She leaves her dear Paree,
To continue the old spooning.
And arrives in time to see
The royal honeymooning.
Then Lamberto has bad luck,
But, for plots he’s never stuck;
So he calls in one Don Jan—
A rich Brazilian —
And informs him re Fanchette
That it’s very hard to win her,
Of course this on does set
That rich and swarthy sinner;
And he lays all sorts of things,
Such as aluminium rings
And an Abyssinian chain
At her feet, but all in vain.
But at last she has to flee
From this grandee gay and giddy.
So she joins the Queeu’s navee
And becomes a Royal Middy.
Then the plot grows kind of thick—
But we’ll wind up pretty slick
By saying that the Queen
Spared Lamberto any scene.
But took him to her arms.
Whence nevermore strayed off he.
And Fanchette with all her charms
With Don Jan, is growing coffee
In Brazil. We cannot tell
To the rest what fate befell,
Though they died, we have no doubt,
When the Tribune first came out.
• * *
The “Royal Middy” is certainly a pretty and
sparkling opera. It has no backbone in it, and no
memorable melodies, though the music throughout is
nice and frothy, like the head on champagne. The
dialogue is champagny also. There is wit in it hare
and there, but chiefly there. And the wit is not
afflictingly sharp. The piece is well set, the dresses
are delightful, and Clint’s scenery is capital.
• • #
Fanchette is a delightful creature. Perhaps if
any other than our own Emelie played the part, we
should not be so emphatic in our admiration. We can-
not speak too well of her acting. We might possibly
exaggerate if we said that she was exactly the very
same Emelie who in days of yore fascinated us with her
“ See how it sparkles,” and so on, in poor dead Lyster’s
salad days. We will stop here, and only say that her
performance is as charming as —as herself.

Miss Madeline St. Clair, as Maria Francesca,

■We have only now to deal with the gentlemen.
Mr. Armes Beaumont is a capital Don Lamberto, and
acts exceedingly well. Mr. Edward Farley, as Don
Jsnnario Paraguasse Cababrio, is as magnificent as his
name, in style, appearance, and voice. Besides, his
business is finely absurd. Mungo (Mr. T. 8 Caseelli),
is a nigger of anew type He is a joke in ebony, a
scream in soot. Mr. Casselli is a comedian. Dom Do-
mingus de Barras (Mr. John Forde), and Captain Nor-
beto (Signor Luisetti), are very good in their way.
We went to see the bicycle tournament at the
Exhibition on Tuesday afternoon. We arrived about
five, in muddy boots, and a shocking bad hat—thus
tervilely pandering to the elements. The show is being
given at the Exhibition Building, and, is, we believe, to
last several years This is now the first year of it. The
affair is of an exciting nature. There ore seven men
riding round on bicycles, and a man in the middle of the
place selling oysters and multum inparvo. Our interest
was chiefly centred in this man. We even compli-
mented him upon the appearance of his stand, and
suggested that ha should have his portrait taken in
character. He, however, did not suggest any oysters
or lemon-squash. The audience numbered about
50 000,000. Yet, nobody seemed to want oysters or
multum in parvo. They were there purely for the love
of sport. We were there purely for the love of
anyhow, as it happened, we had to love sport. There was
nothing else to cling to. It is a very pretty and in-
teresting thing to see men riding round on bicycles.
But it is more enthralling when you don’t know
any of them. Wo were not acquainted with a
single lider, and were consequently enthralled. We
were to'd Eolfe was leading, at which intelligence we
grew excited; but our enthusiasm wo subsequently
damped by discovering that there was no water in the
fountain-basin. How mean that fountain looked with
its veidigisy spent and with Botany-water mud corus-
cating in cakes in its basin. Mr. Wade, who is the
bloated proprietor of the show, was elated but com-
posed. He said that he had only come over here
intending to make a thousand a week, but now not only
were hie wildest anticipations abundantly realised, but
he calculated on buying a palace or a mule at the end
of the mouth. Ho told us confidentially that he would
be certain to purchase the mule anyhow,—since he had
long wished for a capable financial adviser. We left
after staying two days. Eolfe was then still ahead.
Looking at Largan.
A. PATHETIC INTERVIEW.
We don’t interview people frequently—though
we ourselves are interviewed with a painful regularity—
the days generally being either when “ she has brought
it home, starched and mended,” or on those occasions
when the week is up at the “ three-roomer.” However,
when a very big “star” appears on the horizon, we have
occasionally donned our"seven-leaguers, and slouched
round, armed with a cheap note-book, to do her— no mala
star would ever get ns out, unless he sent us either a.
valentine or a pair of goloshes—honour. The foregoing;
real arks, however, only apply to people in the dramatic
“perfesh.” For when we heard that the great Bargain
was to be seen at a certain place at a certain hour, we
borrowed the landlord’s boots, and flitted round to see
him. It was a wet night, too—cold and raw —but we
don’t care what inconvenience we suffer, so long as wa
grovel to either of those beautiful beings—a celebrated
sculler or a professional pedestrian,
• • •
We found Mr. Largan—or shall we say, “ John
Largan, Esq.?”—entertaining a select company o£
• quatio enthusiasts in a back parlour of the Harbour
View Hotel. In appearance “John Largan, Esq.," is a
giant—especially about the feet. These struck us aa
being his most expressive features. “ My face is my
fortune, sir," remarked the milkmaid in “ The House
that Jack Built,” a saying which has generally been
admitted to have been devoid of exaggeration. Well,
Mr. Largan could affirm with equal veracity, that hie
feet were his fortune. They are large enough, not only
to keep one, but several men in affluence. When not
training he could 1st them out as a ssittlo-alley, or as a.
hippodrome for a bicycle tournament. Likewise they
would make desirable building sites, or a capital shilling
stand at the races. Facially, Mr. Largan is extremely
beautiful. He is a kind of Archibald [Qrosvenor, Ed.
B ], escaped from Brobdingnag. But he is not aesthetic,
though extremely humorous; and he is as dignified, aa
affable, as a sculler dare be to a journalistic groveller.
In reply to soma polite queries—but we had better give
the interview as it happened.
• * #
Our Representative. —Do you contemplate making a
match shortly, Mr. Largan ?
John Largan, Esq. —Not unless you can lay me on to a
man who can’t pull. I intend to work at my trade for
a bit.
O.R. —What trade are you P A florist ?
J L. Esq.— No; I never hawked fish yet. I’m a car-
penter.
O.R —Oh, indeed. Where are you staying—Govern-
ment House ?
J. L Esq. —I’m living private until the stretcher and
grand planner arrive from 'Frisco.
0 R. —We hear you had an accident—Is it true ?
J.L. Esq. —Yes. It was in ’Frisco. I ordered fowla
for uinner. Well, just as I took the first mouthful
some fallow called out, and I got nearly choked. That
infernal landlord had put a turkey amongst those fowls,
and 1 had swallowed by mistake and strained the uvula.
0 R —That’s a bad job 1
J.L Esq.—ye s. I told Paddy Punch about it when
I arrived, and he advised me to carry it in a sling for a
week or two. .
O R —Have you heard, Mr Largan, that they say in
the papers you didn’t behave as you eughter as regards
the Sportsman Cup, and went round to call on your
backer by way of San Francisco ?
J.L. Esq.— Dear me! Heard it? No, I suppose it
was in a religious paper. Well, I can’t subscribe to
them all.
0 R — But in Mr. Devereux’s letter to
J.L , Esq.—That was only a little joke, that was. Ha
heard I was going into the Church, and was a bit piqued.
O.R. —Do you think yon can beat Laycock ?
J.L, Esq —Yes, if some one will lead me a big stick
and get three men to hold him.
O.R. (annoyed)—Bat, seriously. Are not you going to
get a big thing on ?
J L.. Esq.—Bather I
O.R, (flapping both ears forward) —What’s that ?
J L , Esq.—I'm going to tow Sheppard for sixpence.
0 R.— You’ll compete, of course, for The Bulletin
trophy.
J.L., Esq.—What’s that ?
O.R.— Oil, a heavy thing in metal.
J.L., Esq. —What metal P
O.R.— Boad metal. By the way, how do you like our
harbour ?

hospital. He feels better: but he would feel better

would give him back his left eye-ball. Had the inter,

Mr. James Barnet, Colonial Architect.
Me. James Baenet, designer of the Garden
Palace and of the exquisite freestone publio
buildings which have secured for Sydney archi-
tectural pre-eminence so far as Australasia is
concerned, was born in Scotland, in 1827, and, in
1854, arrived in this colony. After spending three
years in the Government service he was appointed,
in 1865, to the position of Colonial Architect,
which heihas ever since occupied—how worthily his
works attest. Mr. Barnet’s abilities have enabled
him to take a position in respect to Government
such as is occupied by no other officer of the Civil
Service. Photo, by Boyd.
Miss Rosa Towers.
Miss Rosa Towers is a very charming young
lady. We speak from ocular demonstration, and
her portrait which appears in The Bulletin
gives but a faint idea of her face, which is wonder-
fully full of expression, and adorned by a pair of
black eyes, which, to quote the gifted Gubbins,
are
Eyes that entreat, reproach, and sigh.
Speak words that never need reply ;—
Gaze on those orbs —you’ll not despise.
In life, the language of the eyes.
The other day Mr. Frank Towers, who is Miss
Rosa’s nice Pa, invited us up to his apartments in
the Bulletin Hotel, to see Miss Towers drink tea
after dinner. We succumbed instantly. It was
a charming picture. We have acquired a degage
manner of taking our tea in oyster-like gulps,
with a saucer skilfully balanced on our finger-tips.
But Miss Rosa doesn’t do this. She takes her’s
with the grace of a pixie sipping dewdrops from a
poppv-petal, and does such unutterable things
with the spoon that if she will only drink tea
“ frequently often” in light comedy, she will
draw more money to the Gaiety than can be got in
at the pay-holes. {Seriously, Miss Towers is quite
a celebrity. Going from airy “ descriptive ” into
square biography, we may state that Rosa was
born at Dunedin, in New Zealand, in 1864, which
makes her just seventeen at the present time, and
a little one over. Miss Towers’ histrionic career
commenced at a very early age, and was a success
from the beginning. She has played in all the
colonies; at the Cape, in India, England, and
other fortunate places. Her first appearance in
Sydney was made at the Victoria Theatre, eight
years ago. She comes back here to the sound of
triumphal trumpets. Altogether, she is deserving
of a considerable part of the praise given her. In
“ Truth ” —now running at the Gaiety, under the
management of her dear Pa—she has not an
opportunity of showing ho* full power, as the part
she takes is comparatively small. Anyhow, there
is no show for “starring” in the piece. But she
has done quite enough to prove that she is capable
of doing anything within the limits she has pre-
scribed for herself. Farcical comedy is her line,
but if ever a comedy star had a face for poetio
tragedy, that artist is the subject of the present
notice.
TO THE DEVIL.
Copy ? How the devil, devil.
Do you think that we can dash
Laughing lyric, pealing par. out.
Giving histrionic hash.
Just a little spice of humour.
Just a little Attic salt,
At a moment’s notice always,
Though a dead-head in a vault
Might be merrier than we are
At that very moment when
You come howling here for copy ?
Have we an explosive pen.
Think yon, that we can like rockets
Burst into a hundred sparks,
Into rhyme, as full of fire as
That great hard, Sir Henry Parkes ?
No—but give the gifted compo.
This, you diabolic elf,
With our curse, and —stay a moment—
Take this kick home for yourself.


PEPPER AND SALT.
Some very remarkable efforts have been made
of late to render tha S.M. Herald readable. The
light and sparkling versification of Pastor Allen's
beautiful little poem was a welcome relief to the
solidity of its leading columns, and caused quite a rush
for the paper in Sussex-street. The insertion of this
gem (at 5s. an inch) was a happy thought, and reflected
credit on ithe editor’s j udgment. But still, Daniel’s
verses, brilliant though they were, only dazzled
Australasia for a day or two, and are already almost
forgotten. We have observed, however, with much
pleasure—we might almost say, pride—the praise-
worthy struggles which our contemporary has lately
been making to enliven the obituary advertisements in
its funereal front page by sparks from the anvil of the
poets. For instance, there’s
“ Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade,”
which appears regularly every Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday, appropriately tacked on to the death notice of
an M.P., a hot-pie merchant, or some other “ opening
bud.” And, then, there are those touching lines which
usually move us to tears over our breakfast every
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday—
« Fairer than the flowers above thee,
Fading on your still cold breast.
Put by gentle hands that loved thee —
Romping Billy’s gone to rest.”
This style is very beautiful; but it’s overdone. We
want a change. Besides, it’s too sad. The heart bowed
down ought to be lifted up. These continual crushers
are apt to increase the death-rate among the subscribers
to the “leading journal.” Of court®, we know there
are difficulties in striking out on a new and un-
accustomed track, and at present the Herald is just a
little out of its depth. Now, here are a few stanzas of
an airy yet pathetic character, such as we think might
be! advantageously introduced among the obituary
notices in the Herald —
We’ll sea no more of dearest Jane,
She’s joined the night-robed throng,
She said good-bye to grief and pain
When the tram car came along, E I.P.
' No more will little Tommy’s Ma
Dam little Tommy’s seeks,
No more will it grieve Tommy’s Pa
To have his ears to box ;
No more the chairs be smeared with tar ;
Tom took the chicken-pox 1
“ Which he bore with Christian fortitude.”
Our Polly’s dead, she tried to force it
Two more inches:
e' dresses now where not a corset
Ever pinches.
“ Thy will be done.”
Never sickly.
No cares.
Too quickly
Down stairs I
She will rise again 1”
Wo miss it from the dinner table.
That face so placid;
He couldn’t read a printed label—
“ Oxalic acid.”
“ For of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.”
The Spring is come—now frisks the lamb.
The bee is humming;
But Emma didn’t see the tram.
Or hear it coming 1
Her end was pieces.— Evenin’ Nooze please copy.
How much his loss we feel I
Here’s Harry’s story—
He stepped on orange peel
And went to glory I
“ Go thou, and do likewise.”
We offer these specimens gratuitously to onr esteemed
and spirited contemporary. Gratis, like the D.T’s.
supplement.
Apropos of the South-coast
cemetery sketch, published by us
last week, we learn that many
rural boneyards in N.S.W. are in a
still worse condition than that at
"Wollongong. Professor Tyndall
writes:—"I have seen cows, and
sheep, and pigs browsing on
churchyard grass which sprang
from, and actually contained the
essence, so to speak, of dead men
and women. The flesh of these
animals was merely a modified
feature of the deceased human
bodies buried there, and it was
composed of the self-same mole-
cules belonging to people who once
walked this earth as wo do.’’
What a her-r-lessed thought I Th e
best of onr butter and cheese comrs
from Wollongong, and yet, how
few of onr hash-house patrons
reflect as they daub the “ prime
fresh ” on their matutinal muffins,
or surround their bit o’ cheese and
•* long colonial ” that they are
actually devouring the preserved
extract, as it wore, of perchance a
Southern minister, a Shoalhaven
grocer, or the man who secured
the return to Parliament of Tomb-
stone Wosaby.

A passage in Sir Garnet
Wolseley’s despatch from Ismalia
ran as follows :—“ I did not think
it would he in consonance with
the traditions of the Queen’s Army
that we should retire before any
number of Egyptians.” It was
not very much in consonance,
either, in Znluland, but the
“Queen’s Army” retired there,
and not over-gracefully, if we re-
member rightly, on several occa-
sions. Sir Garnet wasn’t there, it is
true, but the army was. What,
however, probably saved onr retiring in Egypt was
that the Egyptians were polite enough to save
us the trouble. If ever we go soldiering, we
shall elect to fight polite troops like these. We
feel as if we could almost face them now, with only D.
C. F. Moodie and the Paddington Portergsffa to sup-
port ns.

An interesting wedding took place in Samoa
a little time ago. An industrious Briton, in the em-
ployment of one of the planters, found “ single-cussed-
ness” nnendorable, and demanded that his employer*
should furnish him with a wife. There were no eligible
females “unattached” available at the time, so it was
arranged that the ardent swain should be mated from
the next shipload ef “labour” which might arrive.
Accordingly, as soon as the first “slaver” had dis
charged. Bill was on band to urge his suit, which took
the modest form of suggesting that there should be a
sort of muster or matrimonial parade of all the “ dusky
beauties” just to hand as per invoice. As the affair
smelt like a lark, consent was given; and as there was
to be no nonsense, but church and parson were to be
duly “ in it,” the boss’s wife permitted herself to be
interested. The lovely contingent was mustered and
drawn up for inspection, while Bill with a serious face
marched down the line, and “eyed them ever” in a
Simon Tappertit manner. At length the ideal of his
soul presented herself. * I’ll have this one,” cried Bill,
and lugged out a buxom maid from amidst the bevy.
No time was lost. The blushing “ fair ” was taken into
the ladies' apartments, and there her primitive garb—
she had been lightly tut elegantly attired in a bone
nose-ring and shell anklets, with two yards of tappa
oloth fer propriety—was replaced by a complete
costume in the European fashion. Bit ly bit ebe
was invested with the mysterious garments ef civili-
sation. grinning at each article with gratified vanity,
Then, equipped from top to toe—corset, bustle, stock-
tugs, eight-button boots, and all complete—she was led
forth and startel cff for the altar, most of the popula- ,
.ion organizing an impromptu procession to see it out-
The church was a good way off, and as the bride had
never before worn boots or a train, she began to find
these articles impediments on the march. Suddenly
she sat down in the middle of the path, and wrenched
off her boots, displaying during the operation rather
more frilling and embroidery than it is customary for
brides to put en evidence before the wedding ceremony.
When she had walked a little further, the bride took off
her stockings and hung them round her neck. The
feminine participants in the procession now began to
exchange alarmed glances, and to lag behind. There
was no saying what the fair—we mean dark—fiancee
would do next. What she did do was to hitch up her
entire wardrobe, train, bnstle and all, and tuok the lot
under her arm, thus gaining great additional freedom
for her limbs, and affording ocular proof of the com.
pleteness in every detail with which she had been dressed
for her nuptials. The marriage ceremony was duly
“solemnizid, ” with no special circumstance, except
that the bride sat down when about half way through to
hunt in hvr frock for something that was bit iug her. The
ardent bridegroom 1 ai forgotten to provide himself
with a ring; but cue of the biidesmrius with great
presinceof mind slipped a very nice shell one out of
her rose, and handed it to him. In tome societies it

b,idegroom’a appreciation of this attention took the
excessive form of not only li i g elf a quid of his own
plug for the obliging bridesmaid, but expressing to the
prrsona fancy that on the whole he thought he'd like
the service oorclud.d ni.h rtf.rcn.e to " th:«
one, instead of the wench wo started with.” The
worthy pastor was slightly scandalized, but chiefly
because the bridesmaid in question was already wedded
to the mate of a whaler, a sub-chiet of the next island
and the cook of an island trader, and two of her
husbands were hourly expected to be signalled. But
with these trifling interruptions, the ceremony proceeded
smoothly, and the happy couple started on their honey,
moon tour. By next day Bill was pretty fairlv settled
down, and nothing marred the completeness of his
happiness save one trifling drawback, which compelled
him to send up to tha boss' house to ask the loan of a
“boy,” because he “ wanted to speak to his wife.” He
had forgotten till that moment that he could not speak a
word of her lingo nor she of hi». Bat they had managed

THE DEMON-DBAPEB.
She’d bought a pair of stockings, and a dolman that
was nice.
And when the “ young man ’’ brought the bill, lo, she
planked down the price;
But that “ young man ’’ he knew his cue, and so did
softly say:
“ I beg you’ll let me show you just a few more things
to-day.
“ These para sals we recommend, these French hats,
too, are 1 loves; ’
And here, you see’s our special line in ladies’ Paris
gloves.
Just cast your eye upon these silks; just feel them.
Miss, I pray,
I’ll cut you just a dozen yards before you go away.
“ These lovely ties you can't resist—I’ll put you up
just two;
And those alpacas—don’t refuse !—ITi do them cheap
for yon I
I sea you like those lovely bags—now kindly step this
way—
I really, Miss, must show you quite a heap more things
to-day.”
The lady bought the parasols, the French hats that
were “ loves;”
She likewise chose a pair of that most “ special line ”
of gloves;
Aad as she with her parcels tripped away from that
shop-door.
She took her Johnny Davies that she'd enter there no more.

The News—a newspaper sold at Id. a copy-
had a blood-curdling item, lately. It was about a horse
and cart and a nurse and perambulator, two children
and a policeman. The writer thus powerfully put it:
“ Had the horse bean galloping at full speed, and had
the servant maid in charge of a perambulator (who was
talking to a policeman at the corner), containing two
children, been in the middle of the road, and in front of
the horse, instead of on the footpath, there’s no saying
what might or might not have happened.” There is
not indeed! But, had the perambulator (“who was
talking to a policeman at the corner”) “ containing
two children ” not been so deep ia conversation with
that capacious constable, and had the two children not
been inside the policeman, it would be hardly possible
to guess at what might not have happened to the nurse-
«irl, had she been exactly where she was not. On the
other hand, if the horse had been less contemplative,
and the cart had been going in an opposite direction to
the horse, and the policeman had net been shepherding
the nurse-girl who didn’t happen to have the perambu-
lator, it is awful to surmise ufon what could not have
possibly occurred. At the same time, had the cart

The Queen’s cook gets one
hundred pounds a year less than
Mr. Dillon, but he is allowed to

believe, is not. The head butler

actly what John Brown gets, and
what are his especial privileges.
It is generally conceded, however,
that he sleeps on the door-mat
outside the Queen’s room—if that
can be called a privilege. That
would depend considerably, we
should say, as to whether Her
Majesty snored or not. Judging
from the portrait in our sarsa-

she did. We hope this is not high

Some surprise, strange to say
was expressed in the House on
Mr. Abbott stating that “in the
last list of magistrates was the
name cf one person who was
mixed up in some murders which
took place some years ago, and
against whom a warrant was then
issued.” We don’t know who is
alluded to here, and don’t want
to ; tut we consider that while the
appointment is a specimen of the
etercal fitness of things, Sir Henry
might have lighted upon some
less obtrusive manner of showing
his dislike for the poor gentleman
in question. We had to commit
several murders ourselves before
we got to be respected, but though
Parkes may possibly bo less
favourably inclined to us than to-
wards the Very Holt Howl, we
are pleased to chronicle the fact
that he has at any rate been so fat
passive in his conduct towards us. With Mr. Abbott's
gentleman it is different, and he has, poor fellow, our
heartfelt commiseration. However, all this should
have a beneficial effect upon society. Everybody will
be careful not to be “mixed up” (whatever that may
mein) with any murders for the future, having in view
the awful tribulation that may possibly overtake them.

Here’s a point for the Never-tonch-its The

tne registrar, and asked to ba unhitched. He said he
had been got on false pretences. The bride didn’t say
anything to tho registrar, but it is generally consider!d
certain by this time that the bridegroom knows the
difference between a rat-trap and a ratelier. It wants
aitual experience to find it out—or a dictionary. He
has had the experience. We have got the dictionary.
The D.T. has started a new kind of leader.
There is beautiful writing iu them, and some lovely
quotations. B asides this, them is occasionally original
poetry. Here is some of the latter: —

A legal red-tape M.P.,
A raising of points, disconnecting of joints.
And generally-watchful M.P."
We can understand, now, these people starting a new
paper. It was time to start a new one when the old one
got as weak-kneed as this. On the cab-horse principle,
you know. We are glad to See the new rag coming out,
anyhow It will give the corpses a chance to get their
shrouds patched.
The following letter will explain a good deal. It
is from one prisoner to another, and refers to some
colonial gaols:—“Dear Lubby,— Ton'll be glad to hear
that our gaol choir is getting along first-rate, and the
church is doing well. Our leading tenor is JoeCrooks,
who got fifteen years as a horse-thief, and our second
tenor. Prank Jones, now doing ten years for burglary.
Our bass is BUI Williams, a Berrima lifer, who bathed
the brains out of his mother some years ago. The lead-
ing chorus are Joe Gubbins, doing fifteen years for
forgery and arson ; Tom Jason, alias the Cricket, now
finishing bis seventh sentence of five years for garrot-
ting. Our organist ia tiptop. He is a lifer and has
a splendid oar for musio He killed his father with a
gridiron, but had his sentence commuted on account of
being related to somebody in the House. It was prove!
too, that his falhor would not give him money for grog.
His playing is very good. Onr minister is first-rate.
He has as deputies two lifers—one, Tommy the Bullet,
who shot an infant at the brest, and cut the nose off au
alderman; and Nosey Pbi'llps.taa bushranger, who first
robbed a poor woman and then shot her, Theie two
deputies dress up like priests or parsons, aad do first
rate. They stand oa tbe p ico or altar, as some cal's
it, and does what the ministers doe?, only they speak
m-sre straight. Of coarse, the rev. gentlemen think
these fellows are completely reformed. But these two
lifers, like all our fellows in the choir, ara the greatest
vagabonds in the gaol. They say the reason lifers are
in the ohoir is, that they will be longer in the church,
and give less trouble to break in. The choir and efiicers
of onr church include the following :—Four horse
thieves (aggregate sentences, 32 years); two arsonists
(17 years); two forgers (eleven years); two parricides
(lifers); twelve burglars (48 years); three pardoned
highway murderers (lifers); four bushrangers (seventy
years); two Government defaulters (ten years); twrnty-
six garrotters, fourth offences (120 years). You see our
business is getting along well. I hope your choir is
well too. Is Multy Morris, who slew his own children,
and roasted his wife and mother, still playing the organ
in the church at yonr gaol ? Joe Larkin, who came in
again last night for burglary, said Malty was to become
the minister's depntv, and ad dress the prisoners. Yours,
&c., Tony the Lamp." N.B—I have just done twelve
years; have only thirty more to to do. —T.L.

AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.
CANT. (Continued.)
XXII.
A frugal home, but even in such as this, you
May live in fair contentment, if there be
One whom you love to tiptoe up and kiss you
At eventide, and make your uailkless lea.
Here life ia chiefly an uncoloured tissue.
Tinged here and there with some abnormal spree.
(You find you’re short of sugar or potatoes.
And so unwitting, meet the doom that Eate owes.
XXIII.
You get your cart, and fix your brown mare Sally
Between the shafts, and go upon your way;
And on the road you pick up Mick Mullaley,
Who pegged out opposite, the other day.
And, when you reach the township in tho Talley,
Enter the pub., and both together say,
“ What’s your’s ?” and then forget tne wives you
cherish,
And act precisely like the beasts that perish.
xxiv.
Although my heroine’s abode was humble,
It was a place of quiet happiness.
Where she dwelt cheerfully, and didn’t “tumble"
To innovations in the way of dress.
Her father —who was much inclined to grumble,!
And say that Government, and Church, and Press
Were all a lot but no, I mustn’t hint it.
It’s quite too vigorous—you wouldn’t print it.
xxv.
(You’ve been in once, dear boys, so you’ll excuse me—
I know the living’s not luxurious There;
But, lest your readers should at all abuse me
For not entirely acting on the square.
And of too nice morality accuse me.
I’ll write down what the old un’s statements were;
And, so that no one’s purse shall be imperilled.
I’ll send ’em to the Sydney Morning Herald.)
xxvi.
My head 1 My head 1 Where was I ? Oh—her father
Was not a bad old man, as I will show.
(I’ve met some demons —or 'they’ve met me, rather—
But that, as Daley sings, was “ Years Ago ”)
The fa rest object of his life, to gather
A goodly fortune, worthy to bestow
Upon his bright-eyed Jenny, his one daughter.
For whom his love was as the ocean’s water.
XXVII.
Dear, gentle, smiling, ever-winsome Jenny,
His hope and blessing in those by-gone days.
Into whose keeping every well-won penny
Was handed over, and whose wiser ways
Were levelled sermon-wise at very many
Lass thrifty damsels round that lovely place.
Ah 1 Oftentimes tho wreck of plate or basin
Was as a text to bring in Janey Mason.
xxvm.
Alas! Alas! that I could tell the sorrow
That gathered darkly round her sweet young life;
Oh I the long agony onr souls would borrow,
Could we behold our loved ones in the strife
That hides away behind the dim to-morrow.
For all too many: Could the radiant wife
Or happy husband tee the darling faoes
All scarred and strange with sin’s and sorrow’s traces—
XXIX.
Could the fond mother see the petted daughter
In the years after, in some loathly den.
Where Love, or Poverty, or Pate had brought her.
The foul associate of beistlike men.
Hugging the meshes wherein Hell had caught her—
What light could cheer that mother’s way again.
Knowing the idol of her aderatisn
Destined to sink amid this black damnation I
xx.
Or, could the father see the boy he dotes on,
Arrived at r- nhood in his only breeches,
With econo - i pencil, making notes on
The Oh’i <- a lepers, or Buchanan's speeches,
Or seateu .a the Senate giving votes on
Some matter which above his mental reach is,
Or stumping England in Sir ’Enery garb, or
Attending at a picnio down-tho-harbour—
XXXI.
Or, sadly straining a sad brain to rcribMe
Delirious dribble for the Holy Shriek—
Or teaching “ buckies,” like tho Gotdly Gribble—
The pure, the self-denying, and the meek.
Who runs the Warraugesda “ debbil-debMl”—
Ot —Mother Church! at this point Greek meets
Greek —
Changed from a priest to a theatric showman
(1 write this down, yet am I Wholly Roman)—
XXXII.
Or, in the unif orm that speaks the “ copper,”
For ever beating round some dismal slum.
Awaiting greedily some act improper,
And watching where the draggled maid will come.
Ready to suddenly start out and stop her.
And confiscate her little tot of rum—
Would he not say that life was a delusion,
And go thenceforth on principles Malthusian ?
IIXIII.
What am I giving you ? I wander slightly.
Last night there was a meeting of onr Tent-
Pride ot the Something ie its title, rightly—
And, being virtuous, of course I went.
But this is not a themo to handle lightly :
It you, dear reader, are on knowledge bent.
And are cot yet with “ wholesome fun ” too sated,
Just take your girl, and be initiated.
xxxiv.
The inside josser, in redeemed regalia.
Sits up, Timothens-like but, never mini,
Unless I hurry onward with this tale, you
Will feel around for language unrefined.
One eve, what litre the sun of hot Australia
la all his crimson majesty declined,
What time the mvgpie's farewell, fluent, sugary
Bang through the dismal woods.of Jingumyooggarec,
xxxv.
A sturdy youth, who wore a damaged “cadey,”
But otherwise dressed careless of expense.
Was leaning tenderly beside a lady
Against the corner of a dog-leg fence;
And. by his gsstnre, I am much afraid, he
Just then was talkiag anything but sense.
But, men in love-such conduct’s reprehensible—
Are very seldom either true or sensible.
xxxvi.
Still Jenny seriously inclined to hear him—
Why shouldn't candidates define their views ?
She thought, and held her pretty head so near him
That he, being human, had no power to choose
What course to take; so. trusting Love to steer him,
Was thereby wrecked, like many other crews
Who ate so unimaginably stupid
A * to go boating with the coxswain Cupid.
xxxvii.
Not wrecked exactly the way you were. Mister—
Whce’er you are—when through your callow heart
The ripe perfections of the butcher's sister
Pierced (so you stated) like a golden dart,
And rankled there until you “up and kissed her,”
And she up—set your blooming apple-cart
With some allusion to “ita iokle mammy”
That sent you home, all shivering and clammy.
xxxviii.
O, no I not that way—that was hardly “ jonnick,”
But yet it might have happened for the best ;
That class of love is something too Byronio
For general we or—it is the Sunday vest
Men don occasionally, when the chronic
Old love at home is of decreasing z«st
(When yon can take the spots from oft the leopard.
Next stop the typio loves of Dibbs and Shepherd).
xxxix.
No! no! far otherwise. He spoke not plainly.
But acted like a new-anolnted Ass,
Now wriggling into attitudes ungainly,
Now kicking up the unoffending grass;
He couldn’t formulate what in his brain lay.
Which is the fatal trouble of his class —
When sne has spent a dozen seasons shearing
He don’t succeed in epithets endearing,
XL
Bnt Jenny looked, and he became exalted
Beyond the mere preportion of a man.
It mattered nothing that his language halted—
Her love, which was a fiery partisan.
O’er small deficiencies like this bad vaulted;
So that, when he laboriously began
“ Miss Mason—Jenny,”—she said sweetly “ Hairy,
kou are the only man I’ll ever marry.”
ILI.
You think that Jenny’s conduct wasn’t proper.
You simpering, whaleboney, neglected prude 1
But if one jayhawk in a white beiltopper
Asked yoa to sling your sorry maidenhood.
You’d snap him up—you needn’t tell a whopper—
You're just the very sort of crane that would.
You don’t slay me with that indignant look;
1 know such yawning sraters like a book.
xlii.
You say, dear sir, her candour was delightful,
And so say I, aud what I say I mean ;
No doubt, like me, you feci a little spiteful
To see her fooling with a cove so green.
I know if you had been the lover rightful.
And she had told you all her mind so clean.
Yon wouldn’t hesitate, you child of sin, you’d
Embrace her in a way that ought
(To he continued.
POLITICAL POINTS.
The papers in the Day, jun., case are not yet
printed. Where’s M'Blhone P
A LAMENT.
Poor Arabi! your lack’s clean out,
Altho’ you played to win.
You tried to turn a duffer out—
We had a Dullsrin.
On dit that that well-known harbour of refuge
for the politically forsaken, Mudseo, is to be selected
by Sir Henry in preference to East Sydney at next
election—an event which will assuredly take place before
many moons have passed over our heads.
Mr. J. P. Abbott, the other night, spoke in de-
precation of the appointment as a Justice of the Peace
of a man who sells cups of tea and penny buns. If Mr.
Abbott could show that some members of Parliament
earned a living in this way, it would be satisfactory—to
the public.
ALL NOSE.
We're not at all surprised to find
The Ministerial “tail” stone blind;
That without saying, of course, voes.
Eyes hive they none —they are all 44 Nose.”
Happy state of politics! It didn’t matter a
jot who was returned for the Tamut. No principle in-
volved. One was born in the district, a second is univer-
sally respected, and a third universally trusted. This
is the kind of thing the Parkes policy has given to this
bleeding country.
There is no secret in the fact that the Govern-
ment do not expect to earry to* «eoond reading of the
Land Uill At any rate, if they do, it will be by such
a small majority that it would b» absurd to attempt to
make any further progress with it. Which, of course,
means a dissolution—perhaps in more senses than one.
TILL DEATH DO US PART.
Because they’ve pooh-pooh’d my Art Gallery,
Should I renounce my blooming salary ?
This, to ha sure, an awkward vote is,
But I’m too thiok-skinn’d to take notice ;
I’m not, you bet, such a crass novice
Because I’m lick d, to chuck up office.
The funeral of J. Kiokham, the Fenian (who,
by the way, used to write for a Sydney religious paper),
was made the occasion of a great public demstration.
Nearly ten thousand individuals marched through the
streets of Dublin with a multitude of bands and mourn-
ing emblems. Passing the scene of Emmett’s execu-
tion in Thomas-strevt, all heads were uncovered, and a
pause was made in the procession. Mr. Dillon was pre-
sent but not Parnell,
IJSir Henry Parkes and his faithful band of
“holy-joeys” were very severe in their denunciations
of the Contagious Diseases Bill introduced by Mr.
Parnell; bat, despite their raving, the motion to refer
the Bill to a select committee was agreed to. The
familiarity which the goody-goodies displayed on the
details of the q-iestion, and the positive way in which
they asserted that Sydney was comparatively free of
disease, were very amusing.
In the recent Free-trade v. Protection discussion
at Armidale, Mr. James Inglis, we read, “draw a vivid
picture of a model republic, with Mr Buchanan as first
President, Mr. Heydon as Minister of Justice, and Mr.
Ninny Melville as chief constructor of coffins to the
community.” A Tamworth paper says that “ Mr.
Buchanan’s first effort to put a political flro-stiok
into the Cathedral City of the North, must be regarded
as a positive failure. As the Apostle of Bnnkum, and
Ourang.Outang of Protection in New England, he was
far less successful than he was in Tamworth as the
legalised lictor of a defenceless female witness, or the
barristerial basher of an innoesnt boy.”
The Warrego Land Grant Railway people have
made a big hit. The finest wheat lands in Queensland
are on the Warrego. A wheat-mill was to have been
erected at Roma this season, and the lands in tho neigh-
bourhood of the Warrege River are unsurpassed for
richness and fertility The Government have demanded
30s. per acre near Dalby for most inferior land, that one
acre of the Warrego land ia worth a dozen of; and it is
said that if Government called tenders for prices to sell
a million of acres of that district in one or two blocks,
they would get enough money to make two railways
such as that which the company proposes to construct.
The Assembly has passed a short Mining Bill
which provides that land whioh has been applied for
under mining lease shall not be open for selection pend-
ing a decision on the application. Should the Upper
House agree to the Bill, we shall not hear any more of
voracious sharks snavelling up valuable mineral land
under the pretence of protecting the poor miners who
have spent their all to prove the existence of minera's
in the land. But how about the unfortunate men whose
mineral holdings have already been selected over their
heads P
Sir Heury says that the newspaper reporters
have misrepresented him every day tor the last thirty
years. Had a similar ungrateful remark been made in
the Victorian Parliament the editor of the Argus
would, on the first favourable opportunity, have told off
his most expert phonographers to properly represent
the speaker by reporting him verbatim, with all faults
of aocsnt and pronunciation. How inexpressibly
ornate would be a speech by Sir Henry treated iu this
manner I The way in which the Herald meets such
an aspersion on its reporting staff is to omit the remark
from their report and let it pass without comment.
Dr. Renwick broke the Washingtonian rule the
other night, and was subjected loan ex josnre which
would have humiliated any man other than a Minister
of the Crown, Now-a-days Ministers have to be prac-
tised hands at well, at misleading. Dr. Tarrant
mentioned the fact that the naval officers had recom-
mended the home authorities to remove the head station
from this port owing to the extent to whioh syphilitic
disease wag contracted by the sailors here. 44 Excuse
me,’’ said the other doctor; 44 it was on account of
typhoid fever.” 44 And, excuse me,” said Mr. Parnell,
44 here is a letter from the doctor of the Wolverene,
whioh says that the recommendation was made for the
reason stated by Dr. Tarrant,” But Dr. Renwick did
not seem to be at all disconcerted.
Time was when the leader of the “ strongest
Government ” would take a defeat over a Bill to prevent
the shooting of the 44 scheduled bird with a barrel six
feet long,” or an Act making it a misdemeanour for hens
to lay eggs on the Sawbath morn, as a vote of censure,
and put on frills accordingly. The other day, however,
he was 44 stood on his head” three times in succes.
sion over the Garden Palace and Art Gallery sites, but
he took his gruel quietly, and still holds on to his billet
with all the tenacity of a slaughter-house crow to a
dead horse, or a thirsty 41 soj ur ” to a quart of 44 wallop.”
The light of other days has faded, and tbe ranks of onr
unemployed seem destined to be swelled by the mem-
bers of what Daniel Wintworth O’Connor would call
41 the moast nnho’y alliance that iver ixisted.” This is
sad—as heartrending, almost, as tho loss of a deaf
mother-in-law; but Allah is good, and when it comes
we’ll bear our loss with a brave heart, and a “binjie'*
well lined with Bourbon.

THE NEWSLETTER.
At Wellington, N.Z., there has lately been a
strange trial, resulting in the conviction of two
prisoners (father and daughter) for conspiring to accuse
a young man named Longhurst of rape, on which
charge the unfortunate youth was branded with infamy,
given fifty lashes, and marked for life. The jury only
retired for an hour, and by their verdict have pro-
claimed the charge against Longhurst to be utterly
false, and the result of the foulest per j nry. The case is
the most shocking of its kind that has ever come under
public notice in New Zealand.
A youngster of four years was lost in the bush
recently, at Mount, Gambier, S i., for feur days and
nights. He was found-only slightly feverish from
privation and exposuse—sitting on a stone with his feet
in the water of a running creek. He had sat in this
position two days and two nights and when sleepy used
to lie back on a heap of sand which served both as
couch and pillow. It seemed impossible for him to
move without getting drowned.
Chinese burglars prepare a compound of some
potent ingredients, set it alight, and then blow the
fumes into a room through a small, almost imperoepti-
hie, hole in the wall. The effect of the drug is com-
pletely to paralyse the unhappy inmates who, aithougn
they can neither apeak nor stir, are yet sufficiently con-
scious to watch the thieves coolly carrying off their
valuables. Water absorbs the poisonous vapours, and,
therefore, wealthy people sleep in chambers having
open troughs of water all round them.
When the war oorresoondent talks of “ skirmish-
ers annoying a regiment,- ' < t understand what a very-
grim meaning that little t.urasa has. A man gets <
bullet through the head, jumps into the air a little, and
then falls limp ; another crawls away hke a wounded
rabbit, trailing a smashed limb ; another stiffens sud-
denly, and remains with an ugly look upon his face.
This is the “ annoying” the man with tho notebook
describes so lightly and vaguely.

Great dissatisfaction is expressed at the way a

Lewis Sampson, who, it will be remembered,
received a sentence of three years for perjury ia tne
Dibbs-Shapherd case, was released yesterday, alter
serving two years five months and five days. There are
a great many who seem to think—well, we had better

THIS Company is formed to purchase and work the
J- rich Gold Mining Leases belonging to Mr. George
Slater, at Ophir, containing about 44 acres of Goid-
bearing Reef Lands, at the well-known “ Bluff,” near the
junction of the Lewis Ponds and Summerhill Cheeks, and
adjoining the oelebrated “ Behnore ” Mining Property.
Ophir is situated about 15 miles from Orange, and is
the locality where gold was first discovered in Australia,
and, in the immediate vicinity of the “Bluff,” the first
alluvial gold mining was successfully carried out in 1851.
The .gold in its character was generally nuggetty, and
pieces were found weighing up to 120 ounces each ; many
of the smallest of these pieces were attached to quartz,
and were sold under the name of “ specimens.”
The “Bluff” itself has evidently been formed by the
Summerhill Creek impinging against the hill side, and
cutting away a large portion of rock and earth —thus
forming an almost perpendicular cliff, and exposing an
enormous quartz reef. The “ Bluff ” Reef is, in the
opinion of all miners, the main reef of the Ophir Gold
Field, and there can be no doubt that the alluvial gold in
immediate contiguity came from this reef, the mechanical
action of the water having played the part of a quartz
mill, disintegrating the reef stone, thus setting free
the gold, which, after untold centuries, the diggers
collected in their cradles and tin dishes. But if any
further proof were wanting, it is furnished by the
fact that, about 15 years ago, Driscoll and Party made
a great discovery of “ specimens ” immediately under a
huge mass of slate rock, which had evidently fallen
from the “Bluff,” These “specimens” of quartz and
gold had been imprisoned in a crevice, at the slaty bottom
of the stream, by this heavy covering, and contained —
after being crushed by hammers—an immense quantity of
fold. It is towards this reef that all the leaders which
aye been and still continue, so rich in the immediate
vioinity are apparently, directing their course. Of these
may bo mentioned the one on the top of the “ Bluff,” in
Mr, Slater’s ground, from which 200 ounces of gold were
obtained in a few bourn, and those in the celebrated “Bel-
more ” claim, which are now so rieh, and from which a
large pareel of stene, recently treated at the Mint, yielded
at the rate of 4,300 ounces of gold to the ton. The report
to the Minister for Mints from the Warden of the Orange
Geld Field, John T. Lane, Esq., dated July 17th, 1882,
mentions this discovery. His report is given with the
prospectuses in circulation.
In the principal Gold Fields of Australia, notably at
Ballarat, Sandhurst, and Clunes, early attention was paid
t« quartz deposits. Mines have been working for many
years, and hundreds of thousands of tons of quartz raised
to the surface from depths of from 1,000 to 1,000 feet. This
shows the permanency of quartz mining, and proves that
when quartz can be obtained in quantity, a few dwts. of
gold t® the ton of qnartz will pay handsome dividends, as
for instance, the “ Criterion ” ground, at Clunes, yielded
for 36,120 tons of stone, 6,457 ounces 4 dwts. of gold, or
at the rate of 4 dwts. llj grains to the ton, and paid
regular dividends; while, during the last twenty-five
years, the “ Black Hill ” lode, at Ballarat, has been made
to pay well for an average of about 3 dwts. Numerous
cases of large dividends being paid from poor reefs could
be quoted.
At no place in Australia does quartz appear in larger
quantities than at Ophir, and gold can be obtained from
the stone along the entire face of the exposed reef, which
is over 40 feet in width. This qnartz could be followed
from the surface at the bottom of the “Bluff” into the
hill, thus affording at once hundreds of thousands of tons
of quartz for bask stoping, and permitting its being
obtained at a minimum price; therefore it is contemplated
to work these huge reefs by means of modem appliances
and labour-saving machinery. Rook Drills, driven either
with steam or compressed air, when used to bench off the
quartz, will lessen the ordinary cost of mining fully one-
half, and the admirable position for crushing machinery,
immediately contiguous to an inexhaustible and pure
water supply, guarantees the me*t efficient means of
saving the gold and auriferous pyrites, as well as the
cheapest means of crushing.
By reference to plans supplied, it will be seen that the
leases and machine site adjoin one another, except where
Damper Street appears. The sole right to mine under the
street has been secured by Mr. Slater, so that the area
available for the Company is actually more than 44 acres.
The machine site is embraced in the offer of the property to
the Company, but the area is not included above. Mr.
Surveyor Blacket’s report follows with others. The actual
distances of the workings on the enormously rich veins in
the Belmore Company’s ground from Mr. Slater’s boundary
are there set out.
A thorough examination of the property has been made
by Mr. Norman Taylor, the well known and talented
Victorian geologist, whose report also accompanies the
prospectus.
Machinery to crush 500 tons weekly, with patent percus-
sion tables for saving pyrites, stonehreakers, and the
most improved and complete stamping gear, can be
erected and set to work for £7,000.
It has been calculated that the cost of working will be as
follows for one week, viz.:—
To wages of 30 men employed in the mine
raising quartz, &c., at 50s £75 0 0
Do. 3 engineers driving mill 13 0 0
Do. 4 men employed at mill at 40s 8 0 0
30 cords firewood at 20s 30 0 0
■Wear and tear of plant and general expenses 20 0 0
Management 10 0 0
Returns. £156 o 0
500 tons of quartz will, at 6 dwts. gold per ton,
yield 150 ozs. This, at the average value
of Ophir gold, say £3 19s. 6d. per oz.,
amounts to 596 5 0
Leaving a profit of ... £440 5 0
or. at the rate of £22,893 per annum ; and this profit is
irrespective of large sums obtainable from rich patches,
which are certain to be met with occasionally, if not fie-
quently.
It will be seen that this handsome profit is estimated
to be made on the low return of 6 dwts. per ton of quartz,
and that low average is purposely given because Mr.
Norman Taylor saw prospects crushed and panned off,
indicating an average of 6 to 7 dwts. per ton, but there is
reason to believe tkat a much higher return may be con-
fidently expected; and this fact must not be overlooked - a
larger number of stampers than are required to crush 500
tons of quartz per week, when employed, would give even
more than the same proportion of profit on the outlay, as
some expenses would not be at all increased. Mr. Taylor
went so far as to report that the whole hill would probably
pay for crushing.
The terms under which Mr. Slater offers this magnifi-
cent property to the Company are—£2,500 cash and 7,500
shares fully paid up, out of the total number of 25,000
I shares, and the only other charges upon the Company’s
funds will be for usual brokerage, printing, Ac.
Early application should be made for shares, as a large
number has been applied for privately.
The quartz being simply ready for quarrying at a
moment’s notice, and no dead work to he done, the right
is reserved to declare the Company formed when 12,000
contributing shares are allotted, as it is very desirable to
give the order for cmsliing machinery without any delay.
In the event of the Company not being formed, deposits
will be repaid in full, to applicants.

Handicap.
The Hon. Ivo Bligh’s team of English cricketers
are expected to arrive by the Colombo at Adelaide on
the 33th instant.
In the match between the Parramatta Alfreds
and the Corio on 7th instant, Maybury took eight of
the Cories' wickets for two runs.
In the race for the Caulfield Cup, when the flag
fall, Little Jack was turned round, and he lost fully 15
lengths; but going all the way he made this up, and
won easily at the finish.
The Alberts commenced their second innings on
Saturday, for the Cap match, with the University Club,
but the play was soon stopped by the rain, the scores
being— Moses 18, Bailey 4, both not out.
Murdoch’s first Australian team was beaten by
All-England by five wickets, but Spotforth did not play.
In the late match the Demon secured fourteen wickets
in the two innings. Palmer was nnable to play this
time.
The Victorian Cricketing Association have
decided to give a public reception to both the English
and Australian teams on their arrival in Melbourne.
We always give a reception without any previous
decision.
The handicap skiff race in Woolloomooloo Bay,
organised by Mr. J. G. Deeble, was finally won on
Saturday by Davis by two lengths. Martin and Campbell
rowed a splendid race for second honours, the former
winning.
The Brisbane Regatta Committee have decided
to offer a prize, value £103, for the Champion Amateur
Four-oar Baca, to be rowed at Brisbane on 10th Decem-
ber, on condition that one orew comes from another
colony to compete.
In the Players’ match, Read, who scored over
100, was caught by Blackham at the wicket before he
had made a run. He was walking away, when the urn-
pire, Pooley, Esq., without an appeal, cried “ not out.”
This is another sample of English fair-play.
On the 19th instant, some coursing gentlemen
paid a visit to Mr. E. L. Tooths’s new ground at Eridge
Park, Bowral. The place is admirably adapted for the
sport, and will compare favourably with any in the
colony. Hares are breeding plentifully, and abundance
of sport is in prospect.
.£3008 was the gross total paid over for the two
days' racing at Caulfield. Of this, Mr. William Branch
received £690 for the Caulfield Cup; Messrs. Bobertson
and Wagner, £490 for the Great Foal Stakes; Mr.
William Pearson, £435 for the Caulfield Guineas; and
Mr. A. Taylor, £241 for the Open Steeplechase.
Tug Wilson and James Elliott have, we read,
been matched to fight for 5000 dollars and the champion-
ship of the world. The fight will take place some time
in January, if it ever comes off, which is rather doubt-
ful, " as many of the Eastern sports are already making
the sign of the cross in the air when the match is spoken
of.”
The annual intercolonial lawn-tennis champion-
ship meeting will be held on the Melbourne Cricket
Ground, on 3rd, 6th, and 7th November. £10 10s.
trophy for first prize in the single set, and a valuable
trophy for the double set championship. The games
will be played on the asphalt courts with uncovered
balls.
The Parramatta Turf Club intend to hold their
next meeting on the Saturday after Anniversary Day,
so as not to clash with the Sydney Turf Club’s meeting
on the latter date. The P.J.C. will issue a most
liberal programme for 24th May next, the principal
prize to be £300, with £50 to second hors's, and £25 to
third; distance, a mile and a half.
Mdlle. Pinero, the champion equestrienne of
America, has issued a challenge to Australian horse-
women. The lady is willing to stake any part of £200
on a 20-mile race, each rider to have 10 horses, and to
change as often as she think fit. There is no difficulty
in finding the £200—nor ought there to be any difficulty
in finding the lady.
The suggestion made by a correspondent of the
Times that each side should lose a wicket alternately in
a match, has been previously dismissed as impractic-
able. The trouble to re set the field each time a bats-
man was out would be enormous, and what was gained
in one way would be lost in another. 1 he suggestion in
question came from Sir Henry Parkes’ dear old friend,
Mr. B. A. Proctor, the editor of Knowledge.
Who are the promoters of the Bicycling contests
at the old Exhibition Building P We hope they are not
the people who oonduoted the late contests at Melbourne
because Percy’s paper at Parramatta says that £50
was promised to the cjmpetitors ~" o covered 500 milea
lu * 8 \ x da, y 8 * that two accomplished the distance,
that the lap waa measured and found to be yards short,
that still one competitor bad covered th? required dis-
tance* and that he did not get the £50 ITergy winds up
by saying that “if any such exhibition of bicycling ia
given in Sydney or Parramatta the public will refnae to
patronise it unless—Jcc. &o." He says a deal more
than we care to reprint.
A match for .£100 a side has been made between
irii a Newcastle man, and Sutton, jsn, of
Miller a Forest. The event will come off in about a
month.
In truth we tell you, sprinter Sutton,

of a few celebrated “ steppers," which shows the feat

Re the forthcoming match between Perkins and
M'Donald, we arc informed that the Young Englishman
has been off his feed lately, and unable to sleep. It
appears that the hot weather crumples him up. If this
be the case, George’s chance will be reduced to a mini-
mum. There is, however, time for him to pull up.
But he mustn’t be long getting acclimatised. If he
were very long the world would nearly have forgotten
all abont him in a year or so. M'Donald, on the other

which will prove next in interest this week to the
latest Bismarckian “ ultipomatum." However, nui

The N.S.W. Cricket Association have vary un-
wisely decided to play only eleven in the first nntch
against the English team. In the absence of Spofforth,
Murdoch, Garrett, Massie, Jones, and Bannerman, we
can hardly expect to get a team to favourably eope
with what will be the best eleven that has ever left
England. The selection committee have been delivered
of the following lot for practiceE. Allen, G. Bagby,
C. Bannerman. J. Davis, E. Evans, D. Gregory, A.
Geary, H. Hiddleston, H. Moses, Marr, T. Nunn,
Ogilvey, E. Powell, J. Eigg, P. Searle, and W. S
Wearne. There are a fine lot of bowlers here, but, with
the exception of one, they have not performed well in
previous big matches. With eleven a side, we predict a
long uninteresting match. With six of our best men
away, we may surely make this concession to onr
P n de and play for a win with fifteen. Otherwise, the
match will be a splendid one—for the Englishmen te
bring np their averages.
Hon. J. White, it is said, has secured the ser-
vices of Pordham, the English jockey, to ride Segenhoe
m the V.E.C. Derby. George Pordham is coming to
Australia to see the Melbourne Cup, if not to ride in it.
He was born in 1837 at Brighton, and is therefore 48
years old. He rode his first race in 1850, scored success
after success, amassed money and deserted the scene of
his triumphs for the idyllic life of a country gentleman.
By investing his capital in foreign stocks ho naturally
succeeded in losing all he possessed. So he returned to
the Turf (ndmg 101b. lighter than before), and now
earns an honourable livelihood in the old way. He is
very shrewd, very independent, and perfectly honest.
No one dare patronise him, and no one has ever dared
to accuse him of the despicablo practices which render
the Turf remarkable. He has made two mistakes in his
life—he turned in the saddle to look at Macaroni, and
ha once trusted a French financier. Up to 1881, he had
ridden 2382 winners. By the way, isn’t Mr. White in
the Peshawar P If so, he will be late for the Cup.
During the recent match, Australia v. England
Sammy Jones found a hole in the turf near his crease
about as large as a fly’s eye, or a pawnbroker’s con-
science, and fearing that Alick Bannerman might fall in
and get lost, he stepped outside of his ground, whilst
the fieldsmen were actually lolling about discussing the
Egyptian crisis, and the style of a day they were having
for chasing leather about. Seeing Jones’ game Mr W
G. Grace picked np the ball and lowered Sam’s hen-
coop. To show what ha thought of this paltry piece of
sharping, the umpire, when appealed to by Grace, re-
plied s Of course, sir, if yon cislc me I give him
0U V ’ ,, u So William George did ask. and Jones’s boy
walked home with the troubled air of a man who had
just swallowed a porcupine. This is what they call an
•honourable gentleman’s" idea of manly sport—in
England. What makes W. Q. Grace’s trick upon Jones
took meaner than all, is the fact that the day before
Hornby gave Spofforth an exactly similar chance, bnt
the demon merely observed, “Don’t you know, Homby
I could stump you now—you’re off your ground ?"
“Yes;" replied the batsman, “but surely that’s not
your game is it ?" To which bpoff. promptly said.
Weil, no. British fair play is getting to Le a thing
we read of—but there our acquaintance with it ends.
The World says that “ it is clear that the
Australians have not yet learned from the Old Country
one of the cricketer’s most valuable lessons, how to lose
a match well This has been no secret in England since
these visits first began, but courtesy, and a desire to
bury all memory of certain unpleasant reminiscences of
Australian cricket, have led our players to ignore the
fact. It is well known that our visitors have scarcely
suffered a single defeat which they have not been able
to explain entirely to their own satisfaction by a curious
theory of luck, which ia tenable only on the • heads I
win, tails you lose,’ principle. That most heinous of
all crimes, disputing the umpire’s decision, appears to
be a regular law of their cricketing code. So long as
their matches have been played, so to speak, in the full
glare of day, and under the supervision of recognised
authorities, they have had the good sense to oondne
their dissatisfaction to themselves, though, at the
recent match against Cambridge, at Portsmouth, one
of their players was ill-advised enough to grumble
loudly, as well as deeply. But if the match takes
place late in the season, before a scratch company and
against a scratch company, when all fear of conse-
quences ia removed, there is no knowing what may
take place, or rather, one might almost say, there is
considerable possibility that something very nnpleasant
might take place. Disagreeables have happened before
now in connection with these international contests.
We have agreed to foiget them, and it is to bo hoped
the Australians will be well advised enough not to
force us to recall them." Now, isn’t it strange that
our boys tell exactly the opposite story ?
“Mr. Spofforth,” writes Vanity Fair "is
the best bowler ever seen. For this reason’it is
a pity that he should give anyone the notion that
he does not alwavs rely on the fair expedients
of his art. In the match England v. Australia
he certainly made many people talk in a com-
plaining manner. Young Maurice Bead faced the re-
doubtable Australian, and the first ball of the over
caught the batsman right in the midriff, and made him
double up for a few secends. The next ball came in at
a terrific pace, and hit the youngster on the knee-cap.
The next ball got np badly and gave Bead a stinging
blow on the elbow, I then saw the lad’s knees tremble
a little when he got ready to receive the next ball, and
well he might be nervous. As a specimen of bombard-
ment, this rattling over was decidedly successful, but
it was not skilful cricket. When we remember that
Spefforth generally breaks a bill in from the off, it
seems strange that Bead should have been hit in such
places. It may be said that Spofforth’s bowling is
apt to get up, and that is true enough. But why
were not other men hit? Personally, I believe the
affair was accidental; but when other people remember
that young Bead lately made 130 against the Colonists,
they make remarks wnioh generous Englishmen depre-
cate. It must bo said that on the second day of the
match Spofforth’s bowling was almost perfect. He did
not bombard anybody, and during one space of twenty-
five minutes, neither Mr. Lucas nor Mr. Lyttleton
couid score from him. It was good to see the way in
which the crowd watched his performance He was
sending away one man after another, yet the more
damage he did the more the enormous multitude ap-
plauded. Every point of the game was followed with
instant apprehension, and not a sign of ungenerous
feeling appealed. The difference between that goad-
humoured, well-behaved crowd, and the filthy craws
that frequent racecourses, was snffliient to set one
thinking. Why should the twenty thousand at the Oval
be mostly made up of pleasant and reputable people,
while a suburban race-meeting held witnin seven miles
of the Oval makes a man feel sick of his species ? Does
it not seem to prove that the folks with money are on-
oouraging the wrong sort of sport ? Social questions
apart, I am glad that Spoflorth*s bowling in the second
innings left no chanee for any remarks except words of
praise.”
The inauguration of the Balmain Bowing Club
eventuates on Saturday, and will be presided over by
Mr. W. A. Hutchinson, Major of the borough. A pro-
cession of boats in which the various Sydney and subur-
ban crews will unite has been arranged for 2 30 p.m A
steamer, which will bring visitors from Sydney, and
pick others up en route, has been kindly placed at the
disposal of the club by Mr. H. Perdriau, senr.
Full particulars of the great match —Australia
v. England—are to hand. Tne attendance was enor-
mous, neatly £20,000 each day—admission Is., un-
covered reserve XOs., covered reserve £1. Great pains
taken in the selection of the English team. Lord
Harris, V. E. Walker, F. Burbidge, and I. D. Walker
each sent in lists, and from these the final selection
was made. The weather was unpropitions, rendering
the match a bowlers’ game. Murdoch won the tos?,
and sent his men in. Massie was bowled by Ulyett for
1 with a fast “yorker.” Murdoch followed, and after
playing well, and bringing the score up to 25, he was
bowled by Paate. Bonnor was soon afterwards got rid
of, and Bannermau was magn ! Icently caught at point
with the left hand by W. G urace. Six wickets fell
for 30 run*. When Blackham and Garrett got together
they improved matters, but the others made no stand,
and the beam ware disposed of f or 63 —the smallest total
they had yet made in England. Barlow and Grace
opened for England, and the latter was bowled for 4
(when the score stood at 15) by a “yorker" from
Spofforth. Ulyett mads 26, but in his first over Black-
ham had a chance to stump him off a fast one from
Spofforth. Ulyett threw away his wicket eventually
by rushing out to hit Spofforth, when he was easily
stumped. 3 wickets for 57. Lyttelton, Lucas, and
Stndd added only 6 more runs to the score. Steel and
Bead played remarkably well, and the innings closed
for 101. In the second innings of the Australians,
Massie “skelped” the bowling most unmercifully.
He made 20 out of the first 25 runs. At 47, he was
badly missed at long-off by Lucas, his score being then
38. 50 runs were obtained in 40 minutes. When he
had scored 55, he was bowled by Steel, leaving the
Australians 28 to the good. Bonnor's middle stump
was bowled by Ulyett, and Murdoch followed. Then
Bannerman was caught, having been an hour and ten
minutes making 13 runs. Grace caught both Horan
and Giffen. When Jones joined Murdoch, a good
stand was made, but not many runs. When
the colt’s score had reached 6, he was run out. He
had just made his run, and went out to pat the ground
with h»s bat. Grace, who held the ball, put his wicket
down, and appealed. The umpire replied, “If you
claim it, I must give him out." Of course Grace
claimed it, as he is noted for being the cleverest ex-
ponent of sharp practice at cricket, either in the
colonies or in England. However, it is satisfactory to
know that this didn’t get a win for the Englishmen.
The remaining wickets fell rapidly. When Garrett
was in he drove Steel hard to long.off, where it was
finely fielded by Hornby. Murdoch, knowing that
Hornby could not throw, attempted the run, but the
latter tossed the ball to Stndd, who made a smart
return, well taken by Lyttelton, who had the bails off
when Murdoch was half a yard from his crease. The
last wicket fell for 122, leaving the Englishmen 85 to
win. When their score reached 15, Hornby and Barlow
were clean bowled by Spofforth in successive balls.
Ulyett with Grace raised the score to 51, when the
former was caught at the wioket by Blackham. 31 runs
to win, 7 wickets to fall—60 to 1. Grace was then
caught by Boyle for 32. Lyttelton played a rook game,
being afraid to hit. Twelve maidens were bowled in
succession. Then he was bowled by Soofforth. 19
runs to win, 5 wioketa to fall; Lucas play mg a great
game. Steel came in, Lucas made 4, then Steel was
bowled by Spofforth. Maurice Bead was bowled second
ball; Barnes followed, made 2; then three byes were
run. Lucas played a ball on to his wioket. C. T.
Studd, kept back for a forlorn hope, followed, and
Barnes was caught off his glove. Feate followed, made
2, and was then bowled; the Australians winning by 7
runs. A scene of indescribable excitement ensued,
during which a man dropped dead. The Australians
were enthusiastically cheered by their fellow-colonists.

very thorough. A charming woman ha* come all the
way from Melbourne with her husband—j ut to see the
Australians play cricket in England. She has been

races at No-libeltown, the owner of a horse, it is
alleged, gave instructions to the jockey not to win. The
latter, appears had hard work to hold the horse suffi-
oiently to make him run second. The owner, jockey,
and horse wore immediately disqualified by the local
club. At a meeting of another cinb, who endorsed the j
verdict, the owner made a hot attack on the local I
editor, and also threatened to wipe the floor with the
secretary. Ho was subsequently fined £i, in default seven

The hurdle race at the recent Napier (N.Z.) Races was
quite a chapter of accidents. Lone Hand, the Australian
grey, who was favourite, fell at the first fence. Tartar

A sporting baronet a short time since in Eng-
land had the audacity to take Fred Archer (the oracg
jockey) as his guest to a certain club in St. James’,
street, London. At this there was no small indignation
on the part of some of the members, to which the
gentleman remarked that Fred was a long way better
off than the majority of them, as he had at the very
least an ineome of £5000 a year After next year the
English Derby weights will be raised by 41b., colts
carrying 9st., and fillies 8jt. 91b. It is thought by many
j udges that raising the scale will encourage the breed.

amount in long beers The London Swimming Asso-

again by Mr. J. P. Taylor, of Newcastle, who, in carry,

becomes entitled to its absolute possession Ulyett
was disposed of in a rather curious manner in a recent
game between Lancashire and Yorkshire, the ball re-
bounding off the wicket-keeper’s pads on to the wicket
while the batsman was out of his ground, and he was
given out as "stumped.” An eleven of Cambridge
University, in a gome played on 3rd August, wore batting
all day for 393, and only lost four wickets. C. H. All-
cock made 179, Vincent 61, and Carey 66 (not out)
This, however, was excelled by a game played on 4tu
and 5th August, at Eiokling Green, which, it is likely,
will be—(or some time to come, at least—handed down
to posterity as the “ best on record ” for large scoring.
The Orleans Club, in one innings, made 920 runs, the
chief contributors thereto being A. H. Trevor with 338
G. F. Vemoa 259, and J. C. Partridge 90 (not out). In
Trevor’s total were four 6’s, five 5’s, sixteen 4’s, thirty,
two 3’s, and twenty-nine 2’s ; while Vernon had two 6’s,
fifteen 4’s, twenty-four 3’s, and twenty-one 2’s. Takeu
collectively, five batsmen between them scored 795 runs.
The previous largest total was the 775 made by N. B.
Wales against Victoria, last February. when W. L. Mur-
doch 321, Garrett 163, and Jones 109, were the highest
scoters The 20-mile match between Keen and Waller,
the well-known English bicyclists, was decided on the
track at the Crystal Palace, Bydenham, on 22nd August,
and was witnessed by about twelve thousand spectators!
Both were in good condition, and seemed to improve as
they went on, and when Keen took the lead two laps
from home the race was thought to be over. Sun
Waller made several desperate rushes to get the lead,
but. Keen having the inside position, he was never
afterwards headed, winning a grand race by half a
yard, amid great excitement. Time, Ih. 5m. 48 3-5s
On 1st Bepetmber, Wallace Boss published the following
in an American paper“ As I have not received any
direct reply from Mr. Hanlan in reference to my chal-
lenge to row him tor 1000 dollars aside and the chant-
pionship of the world, and the three weeks mentioned
therein for acceptance having elapsed, I now hereby
claim the championship. I would much rather
have won the title in a match-race, which I believe 1
can, than claim it by default, and can only attribute
Mr, Hanlan’s declining to row me to his fear of defeat.
I have tried in every way for the last two years to get
him to row me, but he has always managed, at the last
moment, to get out of it. At the same time he could
arrange a match with anybody else, and in all fair play
I consider that I am entitled to the championship. If
Mr. Hanlan at any time, this year or next, wishes to
regain the title, he will find me both ready and willing
to row him for any amount. I am now prepared to de-
fend the title against all comers, and will make a match
with anyone from 1000 to 2500 dollars aside—first come,
first served—Hamlan preferred. Wallacs Boss, Cham-
pion of the World P. Davin, the celebrated Irish
amateur jumper, is said to be clearing 6ft. Sin. in prac-

trait of Mr. Murdoch, with an account of his career
Charles E. Courtney and G. W. Leo rowed a race o<
three miles with a turn for a stake of §500 dollars a
side and a citizen’s purse of §500, on 1st September, on
Lake Canadarago, N.Y. uourtney weighed 166} lb ,

Lee’s boat was.of cedar, 30tt. 6m. long, 10J in. beam’
5}in. deep, and 311b. in weight. The water was almost
a dead calm. The course was carefully surveyed am.
correctly measured. At the start, Courtney got a lead
of half a length, turned the halt distance mark in 9min
42jeo., ana eventually won by 4} sec. in the splendid
time of 19min. 31}aeo. Both meu went ding-dong the
whole of the way, and never altered their position
Individual scores of 100 runs or upwards, or 41 oen'-
turies,” as they as technically termed, have been made
forty-six times in all in the United States up to the 9th
September. Browning’s innings of 204, made July 1
1880, in the game/ Montreal v. Ottawa, in Ottawa, m
the highest, while George M. Newhall’snot-out innings
of 180, scored the same day against the Baltimore Cine
in Philadelphia, is beat on record in the United States
At the regatta of the Canadian Association of Amatem
Oarsmen, held at;Lachine, Aug. 19, 21, Joseph Lain/
eclipsed the best previously recorded mile-and-a-haif
time in both his trial and the final heat of the senior
single-scull race, the figures being 8min. 58seo, and
Smin. 36«ec. The best previous time was 9min. i-seo.,
by Q. W. Lee. Clegg and Standish, of the Excelsior of
Detroit, in winning the pair-oared shell-race, also beat,
all former records, their time being Smin. 41seo. The
fastest previous record was 8min. 56Jseo., by Bulger
and Graves. Buckley and O’Connell also made the
best time on record (7min. 59sec.) in the double scull
race. It is probable that the boats had swift-running
water under them, as in Detroit in ’77,... While making
his customary dive at Hotel Pemberton, Hull, Mass..
Aug. 15, Captain Webb injured himself so severely ai-
to be unable to perform the next evening. The wat. r

A great sensation took place at a Wellington
(N.Z.i fashionable wedding. Mr. W, M. Lewis, Assist-
ant Crown Law Officer, was to be married one after-
noon to the daughter of the local manager of
the A.M.P. Society, but at the appointed time for the
ceremony to take place he failed to put in an appear-
ance, and, after waiting for some time, the assemblage
was informed that Mr. Lewis had been taken seriously
i 1, and could not attend. ..There was great consterna-
tion, for the officiating clergyman had donned his robes
and the organist had commenced the prelude of the
musical welcome. By degrees it became rumoured that
the bridegroom had made a desperate attempt on his
own life within half-au-hour of the time which was to
have seen him united to the lady ha had chosen as his
partner. No reason whatever can ba assigned for the
act. Breaking the news to the bride-elect proved a
Most harrowing task. The young ladv, who was
terribly aifected, fainted, and a medical man had to be
called in.

“What’s in a name?” asked William. When
+he papers advertise a Garden Party one day and a
Picnic, Banquet, and Ball another, and you find there’s
not an iota of difference between the two, you conclude
thero’s nothing in a name worth being anxious about.
The Licensed Victuallers’ called their seventh annual
insurrection by the last-menti-med triple title. When
we spelt out the word “ball" on our gaudy pink ticket,
we at once told Susan to brush our claw-hammer very
cirefully, and put a clean collar out to air, and we were
sorely troubled how the deuce to manage the picnic in
a china silk and leghorn, and the ball in the proper
sable coat nnd lavender tie, without going homo to
change, and —losing the banquet. That, we couldn’t
stand. Behind the pavilion seemed the only alternative,
with a small boy to hold matches. It was in this dire
dilemma that, confiding our troubles to a sympathising
friend, we found there’s really nothing in a name at all.
lie told ns that the “ ball" did not necessitate any par-
ticular raiment, and that a free and easy costume,
together with our natural debonnair manner, would be
the correct ticket to carry ns through. So was it. In
mid-afternoon, the first flight of festive folks reached
ihe festive position, and after that till seven or eight
o’clock detachments kept following on. If there is any
truth in the idea of “ laugh and grow fat,” publicans
must bo very merry fellows; taken as a body they ooul i
be safely barked for substance and circumference against
any class —except aldermen. As to their better and
even bigger halves, wo never saw so many contented-
looking “Lady Janes" together before. A few desul-
tory efforts at croquet did not meet with much success,
the knights of the corkscrew finding it slow. There
was not any marked enthusiasm either in heaving the
quoits. The event of the day was decidedly the dinner,
■which was attacked by a crowd who at once filled every
teat, and soon emptied every dish. Beyond the usual
toaets, that of " The Licensed Victuallers Association"
was the only one given. Mr. D. O’Connor was rather
strong when he called laws passed by Parliament
“ diabolicalbut he made a palpable hit in alluding to
the Liedertafel not being able to hold a social meeting
without being hampered by an oppressive Licensing Act.
i 'no individual at dinner was persistent in desiring to
ventilate his views at the same time as other speakers,
but he at length yielded to some arguments which were
used—to the detriment of his bell-topper—and was per-
mitted to retire. Afterwards, the “ ball" went oh till
ten o’clock, and then we went homo.

Mr. J. Marsden entertained a party of friends
at the Oidlellows’ Hall, Orange, on the 16th instant.
Plain and fancy dress. About sixty attended, and
uinong them the flower and fortune of the town. A
baauty from the corner of Sale and Summer streets
wore pink trimmed with satin of same colour, pearl
ornaments itt hair, and received much attention. Two
sisters f'om the north end ot Sale-street looked excel-
lent in light pink co-*tumes. The stately daughter of a
leading resident of Forbes was sought after, as ware
also two young ladies in grey, one from Maroh-*traet,
V no other from sumit jr-slreet corner In fancy dress
tne youthful dauuhter Of the best, as a Greek lady,
was most attractive. The modoet America from last
ball was again m active request. Bank, bar, and civil
iMirvioe were represented, the snowy shirt front of the
Miabrjo Attorney-General being almost as extensive as
n bill of costs. The absence of programmes caused in-
c onvenicuoe. Music good, floor heavy, dancing stopped
at 3.

About 200 ladies and a few gentlemen paid their
respects to the Mayoress of Sidney, on the occasion of
her reception last Friday afternoon The assemblage
was very comprehensive, and handsome dresses were
plentiful. Mrs. Harris received visitors in the Mayor's
room, wheuoe they passed into the large vestibule,
where chairs were disposed around, light refreshments
were served, and Madams Merz and Meiers. Younger,
Fisher, and Hallewell rendered music, while m the
iatervala the buzz of conversation was industriously
kept up, Tne inscribing of names in the visitors’ book
proved a matter of considerable anxiety, and those who
did not press forward had to possets their souls in
patience while others wrote, not only their own names,
but the namfls of a number of friends who did not
enno themselves, but desired a place in tne magic
book.

■ The last of those pleasant winter parties,
which have secured to Dubbo the reputation of being
one ot the best matrimonial markets in the island,
eventuated on the 19th instant. There was a great
galaxy ot youth and beauty present, the honours of
belle being consequently much divided. The “Court"
was well represented by the stately daughter of
Governor Bold re wood, and the vivacious and entertain-
ing daughter of the Honourable Old Identity, who were
about equally attractive.

The last Bachelors’ Assembly and best of the
season, was hold on Friday at Nithsdale. Sexes equally
divided ; ladies best dancers. Programmes scarce, and
culls brought into use. The usual fourteen dances
were extended to eighteen on this occasion, the extras
causing lots of trouble. Coffee was appreciated by
those who could get it, the most pushing had the best
chance, while retiring young men consoled themselves
by a substitute not drawn from the urn. Sateen
dresses were prominent, some rather prominent. A
young lady from P’matta River, a capital dancer, wore
an ®stheti« tunic of a pinkish hue, flowered, with
pink silk uaderskiit. Two sisters, dressed exactly alike,
were conspicuous for their handsome dresses, namely,
blue satin richly trimmed with narrow bands of cardinal
across front of skirt, gold bullion fringe and gold beads.
A dress of white brocaded silk ana white satin,
trimmed with gold gimp, was also rich. Two sisters
from Dowling-street, one in a light figured sateen and
cardinal underskirt, the other in light blue satin, white
lace, silver ornaments, looked and danced well. On
n brunette, a oream silk aud silver, and on a gotd
dancer black velvet and silver flowers, looked pretty.
Aud a good-tempered little married lady was light as a
fairy in black satin tastefully beaded and draped across
the front with cardinal silk,
• • -
Fifty eonplea were present to wind up the
Alburv Assemolies foe the season. Decorations, <fcj ,
were quite d la mode, thanks to the ladies, of whom ihe
belle was the fiancee of a handsome doctor—the luckiest
single fellow in Albany. Her comely figure was clad in
black satin and black Madras msjsljn, trimmed with
cardinal flowers. Hardly less admired was her smaller
sister, of whom ’tis often said, “ ’tie pity if is hidden
such a life as her’s within a convent's solitary walls."
Two friends in whose footsteps walked oheory pleasure,
as wall as admirers, were prettily dressed in skirts of
pale pink, cream laoe, black velve*' bodu-s, and pink
k rwors. Two vivS si-tors, one in cream Madras over
blue silk, and the second in a pale pink llama with silk
trimmings, were very nice. A married lady, roao-like
and pretty, wore black silk with cream trimmings, and
a pretty little cream and puarl cap did dight her bead.
Black silk, with steel trimmings ai d c.eam flowers,/
was worn by the pretty pe cite wife of one of the bankers.
Altogether, those described, and others equa ly worthy,
formed a glory of bloom, sweet and proity. A new
feature noticeable among many of the nice voung men
present was a new shoe which revealed cardinal stock-
ings. Beeohworth band tootled on the occasion. And
all the sociable folks of Albury are much indebted to the
authors of tb« season’s assemblies, Messrs, Ring and
Fowler.
The fifth annual picnic of the employee of
Messrs. Walter Akhnrst and Go. was held oa Saturday,
at Fern Bay. At 10 a.m. some four-so®re pleasurers
started in the Eclipse. Foot-racing took place, and
Mrs. Akhnrst afterwards presented the prizes. Dinner
at 2 o'clock, Mr. Akhnrst presiding. Mr. Colley pro-
posed the ‘'Firm," Mr. Akhnrst the “Employes,”
Mr. Meade the “ Ladies,” and Mr Braoe the •' Press.”
A good day was spent, and a return made at 6 p.m.

On Monday evening, Mr. and Mra. G. H. lioyce
gave a carpet dance at their residence. Wynyard Square.
About 30 guests, napital music by Da Groan, dancing
till nearly 2 a.m, The City Catering Co. was responsible
for a good spread, and champagne flowed freely. The
hostess ware a handsome checked silk (a new desigh) of
light brown hue, with bugle trimming to match. A
married lady from Bose B iy was att'red in a rich black
rainbow satin j and a lady from Surry Hills looked
charming in a cream sateen with sprays of flowers. Mrs.
Payten wore a pale green pompadour silk, trimmed
with black lace and cardinal flowers. The wife
of a jovial railway official was imposing in a band-
some black satin ; and a demure little fianeda, nice in
white cashmere and satin. The host and hostess were
unremitting in attention to theif guests, and the usual
healths weie proposed and responded to.
•
There were not far short of 1000 people at the
Builders’and Contractors’ Picnic, on Tuesday, including
representatives of all classes, from the Premier down to
a sprinkling of the “ talent.” Dancing was the chief
employment during the morning, which was bright and
sunny. At 2 o’clock, Mr. Wallace, President of the
Association, took the chair at the banquet, and toasts
of a royal, political, municipal, industrial and social
character followed one ano’her rapidly. Mr. Birks,
Vice-president, gave the "Ministry," to which Sir
Menry Parkas responded. Mr. Cameron replied (or the
•• Parliament,” the Mayor for himself and Aldermen.
Mr Mansfield for the “ Architects,” and Mr. Poole
for the “ Association.” The proposer of the “ Ladies "
was bashful btfore such a large assembly, and as he
stood close bshind Sir Henry’s chair, loaning forward
and speaking low, those who did not know ha was pro-
posing a toast naturally thought he was whispering
some information of greatimportancointo the Premier's
ear. Sir Henry, no doubt, was much impressed with
what he heard, as he was observed to tap the table
with the butt end of the carviag knive directly the
blushing ontor sat down. It was also noticed that a
look of relief passed over the veteran’s careworn face.
An enlivening feature of the dinner was a little differ-
euoo between two youths, one of whom “hflol” the
other for a supposed usurpation of his seat. A brief
scrimmage, a few soreams, and then the combatants
were separated ; each vowing londlv what he would do
to the other—if he wasn’t frightened. Many diversions
passed the time till dusk, when a return heme was
made by the large party. Capital liquecs were provided,
and thus, one of the largest picnics of the season, was a
most enjoyable one.

This is how they get up cheap “uppah ten ”
balls up South: —A popular Civil servant, on the eve of
removal, was tendered a valedictory banqnet by public
subscription. There were, of course, the usual frag-
mentary remains after the feed, which, as a rale, fall to
the caterer or charity. Several ’onto people,
however, couldn’t see it in this light. They
had these scraps, which in no way belonged to
them, carefully collected and assorted, and next oven-
ing they did duty as refreshments at a select patrician

WOMAN ITEMS.
From the Burra Secord, of the Cth instant:
—“ Three young men wish to correspond with three
young women, between 16 and 20 years of age, and good
looking. Must bo able to cook a good meat pie. bend
photos. If photos are not sent, letters will not be
answered Address *M.L.,’ ‘ P.G.,’ and * P.H ,’ Mount
Bryan. P.8. —No Germans need apply.” The way to
the hearts of these young men of Mount Bryan is
evidently, as Pope would say, through their stomachs.
A most enthralling breach of promise case be-
tween Miss Harriett Swiney, a saleswoman, and Wm,
J. LeyLourne, a Civil Servant, has been heard at Wel-
lington, N Z., the jury returning a verdict for the plain-
tiff, with £25 damages £200 was claimed. Ley bourne
was a member of the Y, M. C. Association, and rather
‘‘a gay young spark.” Miss Swiney, the plaintiff, in
her evidence, stated she met Leybourne at a picnic in
connection with the Church of Christ of Tory-street.
She did not belong to the Church of Christ herself, —
she belonged to no church at all. She went drat to one
and then to another, j ust as she felt inclined. (Laugh-
ter.) She met defendant at the picnic. He was a Wes-
leyan, but occasionally attended the Church of Christ.
Leybourne introduced himself, so to speak. (Laughter)
They were playing a game, “ Jolly Miller," and he
cangbt hold of her arm, and said he had been promised
an introduction to her. After this, defendant was very
attentive, and got her plenty of buns and cakes. . . .
On another occasion, ke said he was going to a tea-
meeting that night in connection with the Young Men's
Christian Association, and asked her to accompany him.
She went. Bsfore going ha returned the watch and
chain. His manner was very objectionable. They had
bans, sandwiches, and tarts together. (Laughter.)
There was »ot much opportunity for making love there,
but they managed to have a sty glance or two at each
other. (Renewed laughter ) In the true love feast she
believed the gas was put out, but it was not out on this
occasion. She remembered writing a letter, in which
she gave defendant leave to flirt to his heart's content,
because she was confident she retained bis loving heart.
She wound the letter up with some original poetry as
follows
[After Moodt and SahketJ,—
Oh, to be nothing, nothing,
Sitting in my arm-chair
Teasing and kissing spooney,
And pulling his nut-brown hair.
She received a letter from him after that, addressing
her as “My dear Miss Swiney," with the word “Swiney"
erased, and “ Harry" written underneath. He called
her “ an impatient and excitable little darling,” and
told her he had to go to a tea-light that night. He had
a ticket given him or he would not have gone. Ha had
several anthems to sing after drinking several
cups of ———3 dishwater and ruubisn. Ley-
bourne, the defendant, under examination, admitted
having met the plaintiff at the piemv, and “took her
round the rocks." She said she was tired of Welling-
ton, and was going to Sydney. The Wellington young
men were a lot of duffers—otherwise they would have
married her. She said she liked a dog better than him,
to which he replied that she would not put her arms
round a dog's neck as she did round his. (Loud
laughter.) Referring to Mr. Holliday, where the
worked, plaintiff stamped her foot and sail “ D— Holli-
day." Witness was shocked at this. He thought she
might be “d—ing" him next. He had asked Dr.
Collins’s advice about getting married, and that gentle-
man candidly told him to do so ; giving his reasons. He
wrote to Miss Swiney, telling her this. He did not gee
this out of the letter-writer. He gave her a long and
elaborate discussion on the) medical aspect of mi rriage,
as he had nothing else to write ab*ut. He fllLd the
letter up with extracts from ‘ The .Elements oi Social
Science." He hud been a local preacher on trial before
he came to Wellington, The above is a fair sample of
tie whole evidence, it being one of the livoli.st oases
ever before the N.Z public.
An extraordinary scene occurred in a church at
Chester. The building was crowded to see a fashion-
aolo wedding, but the bride was late. When she
arrived, the bridegroom walked down the aisle to meet
her, and the ceremony proceeded. When the question
“ Wilt thou," etc., was asked of the woman, she looked
tbe bridegroom steadily in the face, and slowly aid
distinctly uttered tae worus, *• I will not I" She then
asked the clergyman to take her into thu vestry, when
she apologised to him, and said: “I cannot tell you
how X regret it. I loved him truly. Yon saw I was
late just new; but it was no fault of mine. Instead of
receiving looks of love from my fnture husband, he
met me m the aisle, and paralysed my beating heart by
saying, ‘D — yon I If you begin lire this way, yen’ll
find out when you are my wife 1* My mind was made
up inttantly. Don’t say more. Please tell him, and let
me go." The clergyman led her baok through the
crowded church to her parents, who took the spirited
girl away. This shows what may result from an
unbridal d tongue.
New parlor maid: “Here’s a letter, ma’am, if
you please." Naw mistress: “Pray, Mary, are you
not accustomed to see letters handed on a tray 'i ’’
“ Yes, ma’am. But I didn’t know you was.”
