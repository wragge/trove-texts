MORE FROM NEW GUINEA
David Forrest’s The Last Blue Sea
(Heinemann), winner of the Dame
Mary Gilmore novel-competition, con-
tains a long chapter which pretty well
symbolises the character of the book
as a whole. Two militiamen, wounded
in the fight for Salamaua, are
struggling back along a New Guinea
mountain track for treatment. For
days they lurch, stagger and slither,
their whole lives reduced to a timeless
nightmare of climbs and falls. Often
it seems they will never survive the
next peak, but, held up by sheer spirit
and the will to survive, they always do;
and finally they make it.
That’s how it is with the novel.
Wounded with imperfections, it
staggers through chapter after chapter,
up and down, over the formless ranges
of its author’s purpose, steadfastly
refusing either to break down or to be
as bad as its faults suggest, until at
last it becomes, through sheer spirit,
oddly impressive.
Its theme is difficult to pinpoint. In
one way it is simply about the awful
fighting for the ridges and valleys in
the rain-forests before Salamaua; in
another way it is about the coming-of-
age of an unproved militia battalion
with a vaguely bad record; and in yet
another way it is about a small group
of men and their first experience of
war. But apart from the battle itself,
no special conflict or development
stands out. The focus shifts jerkily,
as in an old film, from man to man
and group to group; from the broad
battle-plan down to the trembling
leaves that might conceal a single Jap;
and from large-scale assaults down to
individual acts in single patrols.
Important events sometimes happen
off-stage while seemingly unimportant
ones happen on-stage, and many inci-
dents are allowed to fade away before
achieving any definite effect. Only
a few of the characters are drawn
boldly enough to be instantly recog-
nised whenever they appear, and some
of them have, confusingly, more than
one name. Although we are often told
that men are getting “older and wiser”
in short battles and are learning a lot
about themselves, there is little defin-
able development of character. (A
notable exception is the vaguely disil-
lusioned schoolteacher who finds a
sense of purpose in the fighting; but
since he is not the central character his
very vividness tends to throw the rest
out of balance.)
The writing generally is a limping
mixture of botched Hemingway and
the cheap thriller, out of which leap
occasional paragraphs that are admir-
ably simple and natural:—
The enemy machine-gun caught
Old Miserable by the thighs, and
chopped him down with a cruelty
that only Old Miserable would ever
understand. His snarl, even then,
was resentful. He snarled through
his teeth, and fell to his knees, and
tried to force up the Owen-gun to
shatter the jungle. It was a long
way up to bring the gun. The pain
dragged him down and the Owen
was a tremendous weight which
bent his wrists.
It is difficult to explain how a book
with so few immediately apparent
qualities could be anything but indif-
ferent. True, you could point to a few
memorable incidents in it: the walk of
the wounded described above; the
young Bren-gunner killing a night-
raiding Jap horribly with a chunk of
wood; the entrenched platoon beating-
off wave after wave of suicidal Banzai
charges; and the dramatic clash
between a bad officer and his section-
leaders which causes a corporal to
sacrifice himself to save the rest of his
platoon from certain death. But nearly
every war-novel has its quota of that
kind of thing. You could point to the
excellent little sketches of officers, good
and bad; an interesting inquiry into
the nature of leadership; and the clear
outline of the campaign as a whole.
But none of these are developed quite
far enough.
The impressiveness of the novel
seems to come from little more than
sheer intensity of feeling. Somehow,
for all its fumbling and lurching (or
perhaps even because of them), it is
taut with the agony of the events it
describes, and at last it becomes a sort
of battered image of the New Guinea
campaign and the spirit of the men
who fought it.
GEOLOGIST
/ know a man who regards rocks as
books.
He breaks open their covers with a
hammer, prises
leaves apart with a steel chisel. To him
the world is a library of noble books.
He can interpret
language of fault, scarp, valley or dome:
a mountain is less a mountain
than a?i item of incunabula,
a rare old tome.
Nothing’s neat here, though ; nothing’s
undisturbed:
Time is both illuminator and vandal.
Chaos and carelessness are magnificent
even if
he regards it all as something of a
scandal,
books should be left lying about so, their
pages cemented,
whole collections tumbled, cascaded,
tilted, upended,
sprawled over the floor, scrawled over
with crude green comment.
It almost drives him demented —
the destruction . . . the teasing of a
flaked fragment.
But, sometimes when Nature herself
turns a page for him, peels a whole cliff
away
spectacularly, he dances to see
the clean, undisfigured print there,
especially when a long sun touching it
lovingly
calls up an echo in his soul
of the same golden glint there.

New Zealand Novel
There is a formula for a tough-guy
novel which is supposed to have
originated with the Black Mask thriller-
writers in America long ago and which
passed over to England with Peter
Cheney. The novel had to be written
in the first-person, and it had to be
violent. The hero drank whisky by
the gallon, had his love-affairs also by
the gallon, treated his women brutally,
viewed life bitterly, and never missed
a chance to mention the lavatory.
This is the formula which, with
overtones from the dead-end-kid school
of Graham Greene and possibly from
the angry young men of John Osborne,
Gordon Slatter has adopted for his
New Zealand novel A Gun In My
Hand (Pegasus Press). His hero is
Ronald Sefton, a soldier who-has come

Sales have increased amazingly
since we bought the Dove”
“Frankly we had to be sold on the idea of operating
our own aeroplane. However, our scepticism turned to
real interest when we found the man hours it would
save. This proved conclusively that with average
utilization a company aeroplane could show positive
savings and actually build profits. Time is money to
our representatives and executives, and travelling time
and travelling expenses have been a constantly in-
creasing overhead.
“We knew that in America thousands of companies,
large and small, were using their own aeroplanes
profitably. So we investigated and found that similar
operations can pay off in this country too.
“After surveying available aircraft we selected a De
Havilland Dove. The effectiveness of our decision is
shown on our sales graph, which also indicates that it
won’t be long before we add another Dove to our
“fleet”. Perhaps your business, too, can profit by the
introduction of your own aeroplane. Talk to the De
Havilland people. They have made a study of business
flying and they sell and service the largest range of
executive aircraft in Australia.”

DEFENCE PROBLEMS
nrHE Federal Cabinet is facing a
A tough problem in reviewing the
defence programme, partly because
nobody, any more, can set-down
clearly what the vital ingredients of
defence are, and partly because Aus-
tralia’s resources are such that it
cannot afford much of the major
equipment necessary to protect a con-
tinent of nearly three-million square-
miles.
Defence has ceased to be merely a
matter of marching men and ships
firing big guns. Almost every phase
of civilian life enters into the question
of its efficiency. With members of
the Communist party and their stooges
honeycombing and confusing public
opinion, it is very difficult to secure
national support or clear-cut under-
standing of what needs doing or is
being done.
The Commonwealth Government is
not even able to keep the hands of the
Communists off the railway systems,
shipping or other forms of transport
essential in war as well as in peace.
The Victorian branch of the Aus-
tralian Railway Union, which operates
a transport bottleneck on which
victory or defeat in internal war might
depend, is Communist-controlled. The
union group dealing with the produc-
tion of coal, the main source of fuel
in Australia, has a Communist head.
The Seamen’s Union is in the hands of
the Communists. So is the Federal
organisation of the wharf laborers.
And, worst of all, the greatest of the
engineering unions, with international
connections, is so far infiltrated with
Communists that they appear to be its
voice in international affairs.
All these together are perennial
enemies of Australian defence, regular
advocates of the idea that Russia and
China, which have swallowed-up nearly
a couple-of-dozen countries and sub-
jugated them brutally with arms, are
the home of peace. And their unions
act accordingly.
Events before and during the so-
called “Peace” Congress in Melbourne,
however, make it clear that there is a
change of attitude both by the Govern-
ment and some hitherto-supine leaders
in respect of subversion. There is even
some hope that as the Chinese and
Russians increase their ' pressures
southward there might be a return
among Labor men to the ideals of
1910, when Labor was first and fore-
most in the advocacy of adequate
defences and compulsory training to
man them. We might, indeed, even
see the happy day on which Mr.
Calwell dismisses the theories of the
Hobart Conference, most of them
drawn along a Communist line from
Moscow, as more of the mere out-
moded journalese which he believes
the White Australia slogan to be; or
even Mr. Eddie Ward expressing his
faith in nuclear weapons as a deterrent!
/AN the purely military side, the
Government has a problem tougher
than on the public-relations and
political sides.
It cannot establish an adequate
citizen - army because, with the
standards of armament and defence
which it accepts from the luxury-
accustomed Americans, it cannot, in
the first place, afford one.
In the second place, it can’t provide
the men out of a limited population,
taking them away from their normal
avocations for the year or more that
they need to receive any real training,
without restricting the flow of the
consumer-goods and public services
which every family now regards as its
natural birthright.
The National Training system has
failed, and the Army now recommends
its abolition, leaving citizen-defence
once more to the volunteers. It has
done good work in improving the
physique and outlook of tens of
thousands of young men in its time,
and if it has done nothing else it has
shown where a large central cadre of
officer-material, the first essential
ingredient in defensive war, can be
found in a hurry. But. nevertheless,
it is to be abandoned because it is
gradually dying of all-round lack of
enthusiasm.
All sorts of excuses are being made,
but behind them the fact is that the
Government, like many others abroad,
is in retreat on defence questions. The
root of failure in Australia has been
lack of original thinking, the services
having been content to attempt to
reproduce in miniature the shape of
defence applied in countries with giant
industrial capacity and manpower.
IV/fORE effective use of our limited
manpower and terrain might be
made if the Government looked a little
more closely at the lessons of history
taught by resistance of small peoples
pitted against gigantic armaments.
The theories of Marshal Saxe on
infiltration, the history of the Maquis
in France, the guerrillas in Russia and
Yugoslavia, the Boers in South Africa,
of the coast-watchers, and even of the
vagrant Mr. Simmonds, are ignored.
And so is the fact that experience has
proved the Australian, in the bush or
in the desert, to be a natural fighter of
great ingenuity irrespective of whether
he has modern weapons or not. This
fact was very clearly demonstrated
against superior equipment and regi-
mented training in North Africa and
New Guinea.
Australian deterrent long-distance
defence, with Woomera and Maralinga
at its heart, seems to be more powerful
—potentially, anyway—than that of
any country of its size and resources
in the world. But the Government
appears to have almost given-up on
the conventional military side and to
be reaching a stage when its defence-
forces can almost be described as token.
The whole question seems to need
divorcing from the thinking of the
Great Powers. A few competent
citizen-officers marooned on an island
in the Barrier Reef, remote from the
pressures of regular conceptions bred
in Europe and America and told to
imagine that they were facing an
emergency invasion with only masses
of raw troops at their disposal, might
evolve a better and more stable system
of training than the present one.
There is no real reason why uni-
versal military training of basic sorts
cannot be applied here except that both
Governments and people believe that
Saturday and Sunday football and/or
racing are more important.
The Swiss rule that every male
reaching his majority gets his rifle and
entry into basic training with his vote
is a good one for small countries with
peculiar landscapes and scatterable
populations.
But even if it cannot be applied in
peace-time, there is room for efficient
detailed planning for its use in
emergency.

PLAIN ENGLISH
"Peace" and Its Platitudes
The Melbourne “peace” congress and
its various professional cells have
broken up and gone home, apparently
with everybody satisfied, including, for
once, the Federal Government, which
rather spoilt the game of the Commu-
nists. But even though the Reds weren’t
able to get their resolutions in double-
talk aimed at the Western Powers
passed, they didn’t come away empty-
handed.
The epitome of the Congress’s views
which were framed by at least a dozen
sections, mostly professionally divided
and with Leftist blocs voting parallel
to the Communist line, worked out as
follows:
They believed that “another world war
would be unlimited disaster to the
human race.” Is there any Western
Government that needs persuading about
that?
They “affirmed that the objective of
all nations should be total disarmament.”
All major nations have been preaching
that since U.N. was born, and the ideal,
incidentally, was not born in Moscow,
but of British and American war-leaders.
All leaders ostensibly are trying to im-
plement that idea now, but the Iron
Curtain countries from whose brains
these “peace” conferences emanate
demand that if there is to be peace the
world should accept their dictatorship.
The conference called for the “first
step”—“the immediate banning of
nuclear tests, for which an adequate
system of detection has already been
proposed.” It hasn’t. It has not even
been fully discussed. And so far as
Russia is concerned the only plan
in concrete form seems to depend on
Moscow’s good faith, which is backed
by egg-shell-thin assurances stuffed with
dozens of broken treaties and agree-
ments.
It is proposed that the money spent oft
disarmament should be spent on “raising
the living standards of the people,
especially in underdeveloped countries.”
This sounds very well, but at present by
far the greater proportion of money spent
on raising the standard of living comes
from the Western countries.
In any ‘ case, does anybody really
believe that the Western leaders are
warmongers breaking their necks to
colonialise Asia and make war on the
Soviet Union and China? Is anybody in
any Government moved towards any
goal by the double-talk prefabricated
resolutions of regimented groups of
schoolteachers and lesser poets and
novelists?
And do the mothers and fathers of
the current generation of fighting-age
need proselytising on the horrors of war?
Far from there being need to persuade
the current generation of the need for
peace, the greatest necessity at present
is to persuade some of them to prepare
themselves to defend the country against
possible assaults from Moscow and
Peking, whose softening-up instruments
directed against defence these “peace”
conferences are.
Who Won the War?
[By Kollo Gillespie]
At first glance, the publishers.
Starting with air-aces, escaped
prisoners-of-war, Chindits, bandits and
seafarers (the Royal Navy, as usual, has
been notably reticent), the booksellers
established their market almost as soon
as the shooting stopped. They’ve been
consolidating it ever since, and now
that the generals have been let loose,
“My God, how the money rolls in!”
In consequence, War II must be the
best-documented war ever fought. The
only question is: How will historians
of the future find time to cut through
all the verbiage and discover which of all
this gallant band did better than the
rest?
It is interesting to compare this state
of affairs with the attitude of the first
Duke of Wellington after his victory
at Waterloo —more decisive than any in
the 1939-45 stoush except the final and
utter rout of the Japs in Burma, which
was allowed to go by default. Asked
by a would-be biographer why he won
the battle, Arthur Wellesley pointed to
a private soldier of the Line who hap-
pened to be passing and grunted: “Won
the battle, eh? That’s the article that
won the battle, and his name is Thomas
Atkins.”
It may be a coincidence that Sir
William Slim echoes this pithy remark
in his factual account of the Burma
campaign and the good-humored
Unofficial History he has lately pub-
lished. But I think it’s more likely that
these two commanders, who both saw
the soldier’s battle at close quarters —•
Wellington hardly ever out of musket-
shot of the enemy’s leading troops;
Slim in a series of little wars in deserts
and mountains, and finally in the jungle
“at the end of the line”—could not
escape recognising the axiom: wars are
won by men who fight, with or without
benefit of generals. There’s a corollary
to this: the better the general, the more
he helps, but the less he says about it
at the time or afterwards the better.
It’s a pity, therefore, that other
generals have been encouraged to start
backbiting. Men in the line liked to
believe that those in base-areas were
doing their best. The impression simple
soldiers gained from rare contacts with
the high command is now unhappily
confirmed by the bitterness of this “battle
of the paper-knives.”
If a commander feels obliged to ex-
press himself on paper about the cam-
paigns he has directed, it’s better for
him to publish only essential facts and
keep opinions under his hat. No one
minds an objective account of operations,
with or without the butcher’s bill
appended, as long as it’s written on an
impersonal plane. But men who have
taken a humbler, though more active,
part in actions arising from decisions
now described by those men “at the
top” must feel uneasy when they learn
why somebody’s silly idea led to the
loss of friends’ lives. Where buckpassing
develops into a sort of ping-pong match
between brass-hats, the matter gets
beyond a joke. And that’s a pity, be-
cause, after all, we know who did win
the war —the old firm, Tommy Atkins,
Jack Tar and Co.
War has two characteristics which
affect this particular question.
First, it is a young man’s game, so
ordinary soldiers have always smilingly
excused the unaccountable whims of
senior officers as first symptoms of
senile decay. Often —to quote just
one, Lord Portal of Hungerford in
his speech at Guildhall on receiving
the Freedom of the City of London —
the “old ’uns” show that they have the
virtue of humble understanding and win
a name for sense as well as grey hairs.
Occasionally, though, you meet those
whose trumpeters have obviously died.
Old soldiers’ stories sound the same
whenever the teller is the hero —darned
dull—and it doesn’t matter whether they
are worked-out laboriously with a salt-
cellar or a pint-pot representing the
enemy post, or written in the choicest
poetry or prose. This is a point old
soldiers of all ranks should remember,
because if they don’t, their juniors, at
least, will see through them.
Secondly, war’s essence is chivalry. If
that is allowed to fail, the whole pride
of the soldier’s trade drops to the level
of an unmannerly brawl. Chivalry’s first
law is loyalty to comrades-in-arms. So
it is surprising, to say the least, when
knights of the highest orders start slitting
each others’ throats with finely tempered
phrases.
The time has come, I think, when the
kindest advice that could be given to
all —publishers, generals, air-aces, sea-
farers, horse, foot and guns (and the
corps and departments, as well) —is that
the fighting-men of the world unite to
say: “Give us a break!”
An Admirable Crichton
The appointment, as Governor-General,
of William Shepherd Morrison, P.C.,
who was a Conservative M.P. for
Cirencester and Tewkesbury from 1929
and was Speaker of the House of Com-
mons from October, 1951, represents a
new departure in practice, but a good
one at the present juncture.
Despite his English political affiliations
he is a Scot of Scots, with strong connec-
tions in Argyll, Inverness and the Wes-
tern Isles, and has taken his title from
the little-known island of North Uist,
where he was born —Dunrossil, which
might be freely translated “conference-
castle.” His World War I service was
with the Royal Field Artillery in France
He won an M.C., m.i.d. three times,
was wounded and received entitlement
to the 1914 Star —all before he was
25 years old. He is a Q.C.
One of his sons was in Canberra as
second-secretary in the British High
Commissioner's Office. Another married
a South Australian girl, and he himself,
having been here about 10 years ago,


has some first-hand knowledge of Aus-
tralia.
Normally, a Speaker of the House
of Commons retires to the House of
Lords, being entitled by tradition to
a peerage which removes him from
contact with House of Commons politics,
receives a pension which relieves him
of the temptation to engage in anything
that might compromise the status and
impartiality of the Speakership, and
becomes an elder statesman.
At a time at which Constitutional
reform in Australia is about to become
a very live question, and when the
inter-relationships of an immature
Commonwealth are being moulded, the
appointment of a man whose experience
is both broad and intensive in these
matters and whose years of office have
shown him to be a conciliator of great
ability and tact, is an ideal one.
The new G.-G. should be popular.
He is bright-eyed, humorous, talks well
both in public and in private, and has an
interest in sport that extends to every
branch. His Ministerial experience—
Attorney-General’s Department, Trea-
sury, Agriculture and Fisheries, Ministry
of Food, Postmaster-General and Minis-
ter for Town and Country Planning—
as a member of the Medical Research
Council and Industrial Health Board,
and as a judge (Recorder of Walsall),
apart from his Parliamentary offices,
make him a sort of Admirable Crichton
in government and legislation.
He seems to have ideal equipment
mentally and in experience; also in
temperament.
Nobody, in fact, has ever come to
the job of being Governor-General
better trained for the purpose.
Three Non-triers
Because of the political hypocrisy of
the three parties in the Victorian Par-
liament the bill to clean-up some part
of the decadent s.-p. business by the
provision of a credit betting-system
through an off-course tote is now in
jeopardy.
The chief offender is the Liberal-
and-Country-party Cabinet which, in
spite of the recommendation of the
royal commissioner it appointed to in-
vestigate the matter and who reported
in favor of cash off-course betting-shops
as in New Zealand, produced the present
bill, which goes only part of the way
and doesn’t provide accommodation for
the small-silver bettor.
Despite the Premier’s protestations,
the bill bears all the characteristics of
a compromise, and it is entirely out of
key with Bolte’s assurances that the
Government would bring in whatever
the royal commissioner recommended.
Not much importance can be attached
to the Labor Opposition’s sincerity in
its decision to vote against the bill be-
cause it doesn’t provide for the small
cash-bettor. As the Premier pointed
out, the bill does go part of the way;
and a part clean-up is better than none.
The Labprites are allowing themselves
to be used simply as narks.
This is a role that Sir Herbert
Hyland’s Country party has usually
reserved for itself in Parliament, and if
is running true to form. Since the party
still has the last vital vote in the Coun-
cil, it can kill the bill, and intends to
do so.
Hyland, who, as a former Chief
Secretary and racing-man, probably
personally is very much in favor of
some reform, was so worked-up when
having to state the party’s opposition
to the bill in the Assembly that he in-
sulted a Liberal backbencher and was
suspended. Whereupon a C.P. member
said, “That settles the fate of the bill,”
so that a major legislative measure’s
worth could be determined by a clash of
personalities that bore no relationship
to it.
The pay-off for the Country party
will be, no doubt, an overdue bill re-
distributing the Council provinces,
eliminating a significant part of the
Country-party’s minority representation.
Labor will gleefully support the Liberals
on any such measure.
Gals and Gags
When the Queensland “Objectionable
Literature Act” was passed in 1954 as,
subsequently, when a similar Act was
brought-in in N. S. Wales, great fears
were expressed that it would turn-out to
be an instrument for the suppression of
literature. Consequently it should be
pleasing to all to learn from the fifth
annual report of the board which
administers the Act that no prohibition
was placed on any literary work of any
kind during the period July, 1958, to
June, 1959.
The board recalls, perhaps a little wist-
fully—perhaps not, for it seems to be a
most enlightened board which has “never
sought to supervise adult reading”—
that it did prohibit one great work of
literature in May last year, a magazine
named “Gals and Gags”; but this order
was quashed by Mr. Justice Townley
(Mack and Hanger, JJ., concurring) four
months later. Explaining that it has felt
bound, from then on, by the court’s
ruling, the board quotes an excerpt from
the judgment;
I have no doubt that “Gals and Gags”
is “literature” within the meaning of
that term as defined by s. 5 (1) of the
Act; perhaps that is its only claim to be
so classed. As the name indicates, the
publications all deal with girls and jokes.
The “girls” portion, with which some-
what over 50 per cent, of each issue is
concerned, consists of photographic
reproductions, apparently of posed
models, of girls either in scanty bathing-
costumes or other scanty attire. In each
reproduction emphasis seems to be given
to the notorious fact that girls, adult or
adolescent, have breasts. I may be artless,
but I must confess that it does not
appear to me that any other than the
mammary portions of the female ana-
tomy are emphasised in the pictures
except the legs. The fact that women
have legs has also, in the last fifty years
or so, come to be publicly recognised.
It seems to me that the tendency to
become preoccupied with the contempla-
tion of the female torso which might
result from the photographic portions
of the publication would probably be
disturbed by a perusal of the “gags,”
some of which are humorous and some
of which are not, but all of which seem
to me fairly innocuous. At any rate no
complaint is made of them.
It is said that the photographs in “Gals
and Gags” or, at any rate, those to
which we were specifically referred, may
induce in the minds of youths or young
men thoughts of sex. Assuming that to
be so, it does not appear to me that,
per se, it is sufficient to establish the
existence of a tendency to deprave or
corrupt. Such thoughts are not, to my
mind, necessarily indicative of depravity
or corruption; indeed, they may quite
naturally arise without any extraneous
stimulation whatsoever.
It seems to be nothing to the point
that the publication to my mind prob-
ably serves no useful purpose and might
fairly be classed as “trash,” though, in
some cases, these factors might require
consideration.
Thus, with this most civilised judge
(Mack and Hanger, JJ., concurring) to
guide the goodwill of the board, the
Act has—so far —turned-out to be an
instrument not for suppression but for
liberation. And if nobody cares very
much what happens to “Gals and Gags,”
it augurs well for more serious cases
which may occur in future. Somebody
in Queensland should have a shot at
reprinting Lawson Glassop’s We Were
the Rats, an excellent novel which was
banned by a court in N. S. Wales.
Third-party Insurance
In contrast with its reluctance to inter-
fere with the activities of the Rural
Bank, or even to offer advice to it, the
N.S.W. Labor Government lost no time
in going to the assistance of its Govern-
ment Insurance Office by approving
steep increases in the premium-rates for
third-party motor-insurance. On a
private car the premium in the Sydney-
Newcastle area will jump from £7 14s. 6d.
to £lO 145.; in the country from £4 19s.
to £6 13s. The percentage-increase on
heavy goods-vehicles (including those
operated by primary producers) is even
higher.
It has been the plaintive cry of the
Government Insurance Office and of the
Government itself that the burden of
claims under third-party policies has been
falling most heavily on the Government
Insurance Office because that institution
writes about 80 per cent, of all this class
of business in N.S.W.
This is a case of chickens coming
home to roost. Beginning at the time
when there was still profit to be made
from third-party insurance, the Govern-
ment followed a deliberate policy of
channelling as much of this business as
possible to its own baby. This was (and
still is) done through the Registry of
Motor Vehicles. Private insurance com-
panies were at first concerned about this
favoritism, but as the class of business
became less profitable and, later, a dead
loss, they naturally took the attitude
that the Government Office was welcome
to it.
It is admitted on all sides that the chief

Tl/E met the late Judge Mocatta fre-
* * quently when, for many years, he
was on circuit of the N.S.W. Northern
Rivers courts. He was a good mixer, en-
joyed personal comfort, good cuisine, a
game of cards—and a drop of Scotch.
He was an excellent raconteur of legal
anecdotes—to his credit, mainly against
himself. In his early legal career, look-
ing somewhat frail and physically in-
conspicuous, he was junior counsel in
an important case. The senior opposing
counsel was Sir George Reid. For some
reason Mocatta’s senior barrister re-
tired temporarily, leaving “Mo,” as he
was familiarly known, in charge. Sir
George was making a speech and raised
a knotty legal point. Full of importance
up jumped “Mo”: “I object, your
Honor!” Reid said nothing, gazed
around the room; then, rattling his
chair and nonchalantly looking beneath
it, said: “Your Honor! Did I hear
something squeak?” Telling the story,
“Mo” said, “I felt about the size of
threepence dropped on the floor.” —

“Jasby”: “Sevenelm’s” story of how
Bill acquired his hotel (B. 4/11/’59)
reminds me of how a pub in a South
Australian seaport changed hands twice.
The inn was a small one and times
weren’t so hot, but there was a good
bar-trade and the publican couldn’t
make out why he was getting further and
further into the red. He didn’t wake-up
until the creditors were breathing down
his neck and he was forced to sell. Up
popped an unexpected buyer in his
trusted barman, who had apparently been
able to save-up the price out of his
award plus odd coppers left on the
counter. The ex-owner then put it to
the ex-barman that as the ex-barman now
owned the pub the least he could do was
give his old boss a job as barman. Fair
enough, too, agreed the new owner.
Three years later history was repeating
itself, with owner No. 2 going broke
and selling-out and barman No. 2 pro-
ducing a sock full enough to buy back
his old pub. The second bankrupt took
his rise and fall philosophically and said
he supposed he could have his old job
back. “Like hell,” said the bloke who
had learned his lesson. “I lost the pub
that way and I got it back that way.
This time I’m sticking to it.” So he
took to wife a widow with a healthy
grown-up daughter and installed a
cash-register.

“Taffy”: As part of the petroleum-

pioneer Drake (B. 14/10/ ’59) was com-

vanian National Guard. As Drake died
in 1880, the removal of the cause of
criticism of his alleged misuse of a
military title was rather tardy. In spite
of assertions to the contrary by some of
his less-scrupulous business associates,
there can be no doubt that, in money
matters at least, Drake was outstand-
ingly honest. He was one of the very
few men who didn’t cash-in on the
development of the Titusville oilfield;
this was because of his loyalty to his
employers who, by and large, didn’t
reciprocate, and allowed him to become
a pauper. Had he been less conscientious,
he could have made an enormous for-
tune by patenting the use (in which he
was the pioneer) of casing (iron tubing)
to prevent caving of the walls of oil-
wells.

the 8.8. C., several overseas musicians,
and the Queensland Public Library, his
widow has decided that the volumes
should go to Sydney University’s Fisher

room at the back of the building. I
went up there a few weeks ago ; tiring
of waiting around outside for a friend,
I entered. “B-r-r-r-r-ing! ” from afar ;
presently a young lady hurried in and
asked brightly: “Yes, sir? What can I
do for you?” “Just looking, just look-
ing,” I murmured, and went on looking.
Soon I began to wonder whether my
friend had arrived and was outside , so,
dodging that main door, I pushed open


the other double-door and looked out.
“B-r-r-r-r-ing! ” Friend not there. I
closed the door. Soon a man bustled in:
“Can I help you?” “No, no, she’s right.”
I was trapped in there, beaten by the
bell. When my friend eventually arrived,
I let him push open the door all by
himself and, sure enough: “B-r-r-r-r-
-ing!” But this time no one came. It
was sad in a way, as though enthusiasm
had suffered a setback.

“Wycombe W.”: Can’t let you put back
the clock so far in that “little English
village” of High Wycombe, home of
the Carringtons (B. 14/10/’59). Before
World War II the population was 30,000,
and during the war, because of evacuees,
it doubled. Many stayed, and by the
expansion and progress reported in the
“Bucks • Free Press,” which I receive
regularly, it could be nearer 70,000 now.
The Carringtons’ main gate, if they still
use it, would be five minutes’ walk from
the Town Hall. It is now the entrance
for American servicemen of Bomber
Command, which occupies the greater
part of the old Carrington home. The

their share when the liner was thrown
open to public inspection. Pretty well

walking again, though with a permanent
disability, and we were pleased to hear
he’d been awarded a tidy five-figure sum

Court held that the judge should have
used the words “reasonable doubt,” and
granted a retrial, in which he was
acquitted. Mrs. Wusslean remarked:
“Isn’t it dreadful to think he might have
had to serve six years in prison, just
because of two wrong words?” “Dread-
ful,” I agreed ; “but lots of men get a
life sentence, just because of ‘I do’.” Of
that, Mrs. W. said, she had substantial

“THE GERMAN”
by
A. MACREADY
Translated from the
Russian by
VICTORIA BAIAS
She was found near Berlin.
Before they decided how
to punish her, they
dragged her across the
strange country, where trains
made less noise and people
talked louder.
No one knew when and why
she lost her sight. It was dis-
covered casually, when they
were about to begin with load-
ing. One of her many masters
got so annoyed with her
clumsiness that, losing his
temper, he struck her a blow
on the head.
That had never happened
to her before. Startled and
insulted, she began indignantly
to struggle in the wooden
enclosure. After a merciless
beating a restlessness came
over her. In agony of despair
and trembling violently she
tried to break her way out, but
there was no path of escape.
She could not see. This was
noticed then by her captious
master.
“Comrade Commandeur, we
have a wretched blind nuisance
here. There is no reaction
when you swing out at her.
But try to touch her and you’d
think the devil himself is at
large. We’re keeping her in
the fourth carriage. Care to
have a look?”
After a quick check-up her
blindness was established, and
against her number in the list
appeared an ominous remark:
“Blind.” They could have
struck her from the list alto-
gether, but nobody was willing
to go to so much trouble, since
they had finished the loading.
They could still shoot her at
the next stop.
At the next stop some jokers
decided to send her, the
“German Fascist,” to the far-
north with the party of
prisoners-of-war.
“Let her pay for the crimes
against the Soviet nation with
hard work . . . Should be
enough work there even for
the blind . . .”
The journey to the end of
the world was more bearable
in the company of the German
prisoners. She still endured
hunger, but she was shown
more kindness. They looked
after her, talked to her in her
own language, and brought her
water to drink. In captivity
thirst is worse than hunger.
She seemed to recover
gradually. The long stops were
wonderfully restful. From
time to time the piercing voice
calling over the roll would
make her tremble again, as
though reminding her of the
ill-treatment she had endured.
arrival in the camp she
was assigned to provide
water —a graceful, glittering
horse, who had proudly
galloped through conquered
Paris.
In the camp she was nick-
named “The German,” and
at the order of the camp-
commandant put in the charge
of a criminal named Lenka
Gorchitza, famous for his
cruelty.
After giving this order the
commandant pronounced: “I
make you responsible for that
horse. Don’t get any ideas —
that clear?”
There was no answer, only
an evil glare in Gorchitza’s
black eyes.
The commandant’s assistant
did not seem to trust the
newly-chosen stable-boy:
“I don't understand you,
comrade Major. That horse is
like a gift from heaven to us,
and I don’t think it was wise
of you to leave it in charge
of this scoundrel. In his hands
that horse has no hope of
living.”
“I’ll shoot him if he kills it.”
“It’s easy to shoot him, but
why lose the horse?”
The appearance of a horse
in the camp caused a great
sensation. The only animals
around the camp had been
watchdogs and rats. Every-
body talked about the horse,
everyone wanted to touch it,
but they were afraid of Gor-
chitza ; he seemed to be more
spiteful than ever. Everybody’s
opinion was that “The
German” would die sooner
than later.
A week passed, and the horse
seemed to be getting used to
the Socialist environment of
nordic Russia. She pulled the
old-fashioned barrel of water
around the camp. Gorchitza
wSlked gloomy-faced beside
her, ignoring everybody who
tried to talk to him. “The
German” was quickly accus-
tomed to working-routine. In
spite of her blindness she knew
where to stop and when to
take-off. There was no need
to shout at her. They did
their job silently: the horse
pulling the barrel with water,
and the man pouring it into
the buckets.
This mystified everybody.
The rumor spread that Lenka
knew a magic word, for he
used to be a famous tamer in
his younger days.
A party of prisoners-of-war
who happened to be passing
through the camp greeted their
compatriot in German. One
of them even managed to
dodge the escort and, running
to the horse, to give her a
gentle slap on the neck. “The
German” moved her ears and
whined happily.
Gorchitza pretended not to
have noticed anyone near the
horse. Encouraged by that,
another young fellow decided
to have a try, too, only to find
himself flat on his back.
Gorchitza had knocked him
down without any effort. That
(Continued on page 49)


factor making the business unprofitable
and forcing-up the premiums is the ten-
dency of juries to give inordinately high
damages to the victims of motor-
accidents. The obvious answer to this
is either to fix a scale of damages, as is
done in the case of workers’ compen-
sation accidents, or to have the damages
assessed by a judge or a permanent
board.
Transport Minister Enticknap’s reply
to this suggestion is that there would
be an outcry from the legal profession
if juries on third-party cases were
abolished. Since when has a Labor
Government felt bound by the feelings
of the legal profession? In any case,
there is no call for the abolition of juries,
but merely for a curtailing of their
responsibility. The jury could still
decide the rights and wrongs of the
case, leaving the assessment of damages
to an authority better qualified to do so.
POLITICAL POINTS
The manner of the capture of Sim-
monds should put an end to reported
fan-clubs and growing cults of hero-
worship. When finally brought to bay
he came out with his hands up, saying,
“Don’t shoot. I surrender.” A very
sensible attitude, but hardly in accor-
dance with reported boasts that he would
never be taken alive. Thugs in Sim-
monds’s position in TV- and radio-serials
don’t act like that. Still, the daily press,
after emphasising for weeks the dan-
gerous and desperate nature of this
young crook, are doing their best to
glamorise his story.
• •
Heffron carries a heavy handicap in
the “fight” to abolish the N. S. Wales
Legislative Council, for which purpose
he introduced the Referendum Bill last
week. He has his old comrades the
Communists hanging approvingly round
his neck, the Liberal party divided about
the vote (which some Leftists may think
suspicious), and a lot of his execution-
squad surreptitiously stuffing blanks
into their rifles. The efforts of Messrs.
Dickson (President of the Council) and
Downing (Attorney-General) as mem-
bers of the firing-party should be worth
watching.
• •
During and shortly after the war
thousands of lads followed the lure of
easy money into dead-end jobs. Today,
they form a body of unskilled workers
and with increased mechanisation in
many industries, automation or semi-
automation in others, there are fewer
openings for the untrained. In Queens-
land, where most of the unemployed are
also unskilled, the State Government is
considering a rehabilitation scheme for
these wartime dead-end kids. Deputy-
Premier Morris suggests that rehabilita-
tion-centres similar to those used in
training ex-servicemen could be set-up.
The object would be to convert unskilled
workers into skilled tradesmen or
technicians.

The 90-year-old rail-line which runs
12 miles from Gowrie Junction to
Wyreema on the Darling Downs (Q.) is
to be dismantled. It was built in 1869
to link Harristown on the Warwick line
and Wyreema on the Roma line, but,
according to Transport Minister Chalk,
it lost its value as far back as 1915, has
been losing hugely since 1952.

Two voices:
Sydney “Sun-Herald,” Novefnber 15,
from “Fact,” its American oracle: “A
new Nehru emerged in India this week
—a man who bluntly declared: ‘We will
not allow China to keep her foot on
India’s chest’.”
Sydney “Sunday Telegraph,” same
date, from its American oracle, “Time”:
“Prime Minister Nehru was still in a
mood to dismiss Peking’s threat . . .
with what one editor contemptuously
called, ‘a Niagara of words counselling
patience'.”

Viscount Dunrossil, the new Governor-
General who is being pursued by press
and political wolf-packs because it is
proposed that he should collect half
his Speaker’s pension (£2000) during his
term of office, is unlucky in not being
a Field-Marshal. F.-M.s are on the
active list for life and receive their full
military salaries even if they are
Governors-General. And nobody seems
to criticise them.

J. B. Priestley, after about 10 days in
the country, has become a normally
abusive Leftist oracle, roundly de-
nouncing the Government as “stupid”
and calling for the abolition of the
passport-system, since before World
War I (he says) no countries save Russia
and Turkey dealt in passports. Hardly
correct--m those days even the Austra-
lian State Governments issued their own
passports.

According to C. W. Fitton, the shortage
of teachers in Victoria will be more
acute than accommodation next year
with 1000 new teachers needed and only
about 300 available to help the existing
staff handle 93,000 students —10,000 more
than this year. Fitton, who is secretary
of the Victorian Secondary Schools
Advisory Councils Association, says the
Education Department has left its run
too late.

The spectacle of Communists voting
for generalised resolutions advocating
freedom of communication under the
delighted eyes of the Rev. Mr. Dickie
and other simple clergy is enough to
make any Red god laugh, but not the
hundreds of refugees from Hungary and
Czechoslovakia who are so cut-off from
their own countries by the simple act
of leaving it that they do not know
what has happened to relatives there.
Some of the luckier ones receive a post-
card once a month, similar to those
written from prison-camps during the
war merely saying “I am well.” A few
of these should call a conference and
ask the defenders of the Melbourne con-
ference to come and hear their versions.


N.S.W. Premier Heffron will have to
find a better technique for dealing with
criticism in the House if he places any
store on preserving the dignity of his
post or any importance on keeping his
blood-pressure down. His reaction to
Opposition questions on Police Commis-
sioner Delaney’s holidays lowered the
first and raised the second.

If some of the innocents who said
they were going to the Melbourne
“peace” congress with open minds, pre-
pared to judge it on what they found
there, are still convinced that it wasn’t
organised by and for the benefit of
Communists, the only explanation is that
their minds are so open that facts blow
straight through them without leaving a
trace.

Melbourne City Council has been
looking at its lack of power to make the
city more habitable ; to compel banks,
insurance-offices and other builders of
big blocks to provide small retail-shops
at street-level; to make overall traffic-
plans, and to put trams underground.
The council has full powers over
parking, but has been so avaricious and
some of its attendants so officious that
the climate is not favorable for seeking
more authority.

For a short time last week the
electricity-supply systems of N. S. Wales
and Victoria were linked through the
Snowy Mountains electricity-system.
This was done by linking the Snowy’s
330,000-volt transmission-line from Yass
to Upper Tumut with the Victorian
S.E.C.’s line from Tumut to Dederang.
The first hook-up was for testing-pur-
poses only, but it was expected that by
the time this went to the printer regular
transmission of Snowy power to Vic-
toria would have begun.

Metropolitan Cement has gained the
contract to supply cement for the Sydney
Opera House. In announcing this at
the company’s annual meeting, chairman-
of-directors Fortescue said, “Don’t get
the mistaken idea that there was any
political influence attached to getting
the Opera House contract.” Now who
on earth would have dreamed of making
any such suggestion?

The largest Australian-owned ship has
just completed her maiden voyage to
Australia. This is Ampol’s 25,000-ton
tanker, Leslie J. Thompson, built in
Antwerp at a cost of approximately
£2 million. The tanker brought a cargo
of lubricating-oil from Lake Charles,
Louisiana (U.S.A.), for discharge at
Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, and
will immediately go on the shuttle-service
carrying crude-oil from Sumatra to
Kurnell, Botany Bay.
Sorghum-crops in Queensland may
become a source of paper or cosmetics.
The Grain Sorghum Board is investigat-
ing the market for industrial use of
sorghum by-products and, according to
chairman H. T. Merson, America uses
sorghum by-products in making both
paper and cosmetics. Investigation is
aimed at the future; present world-
markets for the grain are adequate.

Labor party hope that the inclusion of
six stooges will prevent a drift of
preferences to the Civic Reform candi-
dates. The only trouble about brain-
waves of this type is that they often
have results other than those predicted.
It would be terrible indeed if some of
the stooges put their heads together and
organised a ticket of their own.

Communist papers in Australia are
fond of referring to the allegedly high
incidence of centenarians in Russia, the
implication being that their longevity is
in some way connected with the Soviet
system. As the Bolshevik revolution
didn’t occur until 1917 most of these
oldsters must have been pretty long in
the tooth before they experienced the
blessings of Communism. Take, for
instance, the old boy mentioned in a
recent “Tribune,” who died at 150,
apparently growing potatoes enthusiasti-
cally to the last. Born before Napoleon’s
retreat from Moscow, he lived under
various Tsars for 108 years. Under
Communism the best he could manage
was 42.

There’s more than a suspicion that the
Heffron Government will before long
make the first moves towards a salary-
grab for State M.P.s. When the time
comes no doubt party-barriers will be
temporarily lowered to enable a united
front to be forged for the onslaught on
the taxpayers’ pockets.

Retiring-age in the Commonwealth
public'service is 65. There’s no retiring-
age for M.P.s nor, apparently, for their
private-secretaries, although both are on
the public payroll. Members have
employed sons, daughters, cousins and
nieces in this capacity so no one was
really surprised when it was disclosed
that Senator Sheehan (Vic.) had engaged
his sister Ethel as private-secretary in
succession to another sister who died a
few months ago. What did arouse
curiosity was the mention that the new
secretary was the Senator’s elder sister.
Discourteous reporters asked the lady
her age, but she exercised her woman’s
privilege of refusing to disclose it. The
Senator himself is 70.

In pleasing contrast to the attitude of
those Federal members who wangled
trips to Singapore on Christmas Island
leave-passes, Doug Cash, Liberal M.H.R.
for Stirling (W.A.), has put forward the
suggestion that the External Affairs
Department could organise tours of
Commonwealth countries for members,
at their own expense. Acting External
Affairs Minister Barwick said the depart-
ment would do everything possible to
assist members to travel.
If anything comes of the proposal
the trips should, as a compliment to the
member who suggested them, be called
Cash Tours. But would there be any
starters?

Wool-cheque for the September quarter
topped £65.5 million, which was
£l5 million better than the previous
year. Japan, with £16.5 million, was the
biggest buyer ; Britain came next with
£11.2 million, and France third with
£6.6 million. Average prices were slightly
higher than in the previous period, but
most of the increased return was due
to a rise in the quantity of wool shipped
—276-million lb., compared with 220-
million lb. last year.

Shopkeepers in Queanbeyan, hit by
competition from Canberra where
Friday-night shopping is permitted, are
defying Bob Heffron, Jim Joe Maloney,
Uncle Ernie O’Dea and all by keeping
their shops open, too. The Sydney

punishment. Queanbeyan’s obvious
course is to appeal to the A.C.T. to take
it into protective custody.


Personal
ITEMS
Admirers of the Rt. Rev. J. D. McKie,
Coadjutor Anglican Bishop of Mel-
bourne, were disappointed when he
wasn’t chosen as Archbishop, but suit-
able preferment has now been arranged
by his appointment as Assistant Bishop
of Coventry, England.
He is said to be the first Australian-
born bishop to receive an episcopal post
in England. He was a brilliant scholar
at Melbourne Grammar, Trinity Col-
lege (Melbourne), and Oxford, became
chaplain of Trinity when he returned,
served as an A.I.F. chaplain, was Vicar
of Christ Church, South Yarra, and
Coadjutor Bishop at Geelong.
Some Anglicans regarded him as per-
haps a bookish recluse when in 1952
he was still unmarried at 43 ; and, as
a hint (they think), the Melbourne
Archbishop’s residence was divided. He
took the hint, and married, and now
has three daughters.
Sir William McKie, the organist at
Westminster Abbey, is his brother.

“O’Twit”: According to Adelaide's
morning paper, Mr. Opperman, M.H.R.,
said in the House that austerity break-
fasts served on airliners looked .like
something you would find in the feed-bin
of a Melbourne Cup runner. “Oppy,”
as a critic of food, is remembered by
the R.A.A.F. trainees at Point Cook
early in War 11. As physical-training
instructor, when in strict training for
a cycling event from Geelong to Mel-
bourne, he would escort squads of
trainees for a run of three or four laps
of the sports-arena, and as each squad
tired and dropped-out he would call
in another. Towards the end of our
training it was not uncommon for some
of us to miss a lecture and slide out
the western gate to the tuckshop. There
he caught two of us sitting at a table
with apple-pies, mainly pastry, heaped
high with mock - crekm. My mate
impishly suggested that we share with
him. He was so shocked and speechless
he didn't take the disciplinary action we
deserved.

“Video”: There’s plenty of the right
quality about Queenslander David
Williams, who will submit a thesis for
his Doctorate in Philosophy next year
at the London School of Economics.
On repatriation after years of malnutri-
tion in a War II Jap p.-0.-w. camp he
started farming near Toowoomba. When
blindness overtook him in 1952 he did
an Arts course at Brisbane University,
got through as M.A. in Philosophy, and
then won a three-year scholarship for
his further study in London.
Over from Fiji on broadcasting busi-
ness Robert Munro called at The

that a London “Sunday Times” review
of an Australian novel had aroused in
him (Prior caught him for here as he

dustani and holds a unique place, as a
practically non-Government concern, in
British Commonwealth colonial terri-
tories). His list of other interests in-
cludes journalism, town-planning and

“E. & O. E.”: Tasmania’s 1960 Rhodes
Scholar, Sergio Guidici, might well figure
as a living pendant to They’re a Weird
Mob. His father emigrated to Western
Australia just before the war, leaving
wife and son behind in Italy, and was
interned in Tasmania, which he liked
so well that he stayed on, later sending
for his family to join him. On arrival,
the boy, then aged 10, knew no English,
but he went to school at remote Butler’s
Gorge (a Hydroelectric Commission
settlement) and soon made such good
progress that he naturally went on to
a Hobart high-school and then to the
University, where he has studied engi-
neering. And at some period he became
naturalised, and next year he will go to
Oxford —first Tasmanian migrant to win
such an honor.

Personalities at the Adelaide F( tival
of Arts will include Hugh Hunt, who
takes over from Robert Helpmann in
producing T. S. Eliot’s poetic drama
“Murder in the Cathedral.” Acting in the
Eliot play will be Robert Speaight, one of
the most outstanding figures on the con-
temporary British stage. Actor, producer,
author, critic, linguist, lecturer, Speaight
will be making his second visit to Aus-
tralia—he came here in 1953 for a
lecture-tour, sponsored by the British
Council. His voice is also well known
to Australian radio-audiences through
his interpretation of Christ in the
Dorothy Sayers serial radio-play “The
Man Born To Be King.”
Sir Donald Wolfit, the great British
Shakspearian actor, is also coming (he
will celebrate his 58th birthday soon after
the end of the Festival).

is being brought to S.A. by the
Musica Viva Society, is a group
of Czech musicians, remarkable

also in the age and mellowness of their
instruments —Jiri Travnicek, the 29-year-
old leader, plays a 17th-century Stradi-
varius, and the most modern instru-
ment they use was made in 1736 j
Another famous Stradivarius will be
brought by Gioconda de Vito, several
years rated as Italy’s No. 1 violinist. For

Norman Humphrey, who has an
article in this week’s “Man on the Land”
columns, was born in London and got
himself into War I as soon as he left
school. Joining the South Wales
Borderers, he lost an eye at Ypres in
August, 1916 ; was invalided out, and
decided to go on the land. After a short
course at Wye Agricultural College in
Kent he went to Canada, worked there
till the end of 1918, and in 1923 joined
the Sudan Plantation Unit —a tripartite
scheme, run by Government, private
enterprise and tenant-farmers (it’s still
kept going on the same basis by the
Sudanese).
A bout of typhoid landed him back
in England on sick-leave, and in 1930
he transferred to the Colonial Service
as an agricultural officer and spent the
next 20 years in Kenya, becoming
senior agricultural officer in 1940, and
writing a number of technical books —
notably Kikuyu Land, Liguru and the


Land, and various publications for
Africans in Swahili and English.
Giving those parts away in 1950,
Humphrey was invited by the Colonial
Office to take charge of the agricultural
department in St. Helena and spent the
next 8| years there. Among other things,
he introduced Australian eucalypts to the
island and wrote another book, Agri-
culture and Forestry in St. Helena.
Awarded the 0.8. E. in 1956, he retired
a year ago, and at present is on a visit
to his son, who lives at Manly (Sydney).

20 years, and which has helped to put
Adelaide on the tourist-map, so he has
that useful kind of qualification for his

The winemaking firm of Thomas
Hardy and Sons Pty., Ltd., of Adelaide,
was established 106 years ago. The
fourth generation of the family are now
running the business and there are
already six boys of the sixth generation
coming-on—“Fine wine, Tintara!”
Here sketched is David J. Hardy, just
appointed a director to join his elder

Winemakers’ Association of South Aus-
tralia. David, who has concentrated on
the rural side of the wine-industry,

“D.A.”: In 1934 I was called as the
key witness in a case prosecuted by the
late Richard Windeyer, Q.C., who has
just died in Sydney at the age of 91.
It was in the libel action brought by
Sunkissed Bananas (Tweed), Ltd., against
the Banana Growers’ Federation and
H. L. Anthony, later to become M.H.R.
for Richmond and Postmaster-General.
The article had been written by me and
published in The Bulletin, but The
Bulletin wasn’t sued. The action was
brought against the federation following
their reprinting of it.
Windeyer had no discussion with me
before the case began, and my evidence
was all in favor of the defendants, a
fact promptly appreciated by defence-
counsel W. H. Curtis, Q.C., who, in cross-
examination, asked that I be treated as
an expert witness (instead of a hostile
one). Windeyer, though my evidence
was a shock to him, was charming, and
in court paid a gracious compliment to
The Bulletin, which had been a
vitriolic critic of his father as judge in
the Dean case. And gracious many people
interested in the arts always found him
to be, even though he had a reputation
for relentless and gruelling cross-
examination when he knew it was neces-
sary to bring out the facts in a court
action. He was, indeed, a man of many
parts and arts.

Two more scholarships to Australians
have been granted by the International
Road Scholarship: a nine-months’ post-
graduate course in highway - traffic
engineering to Laurence Murray Jones,
assistant divisional engineer of the
Ballarat section of the Victorian Country
Roads Board, at Durham University,
England ; and a second to W. D.
Stafford, an engineer attached to the
W.A. Main Roads Department, who will
study at the North Western University,
Illinois, U.S.A.
About six Australians have been
granted the scholarships in the last six
years on the nomination of the Aus-
tralian Road Federation. All have been
engineers attached to the chief State
road-construction branch, in the expecta-
tion that they will return to their posts
and use their new knowledge for the
general benefit.
The International Road Scholarship
is financed by international industry. It
has 70 branches, but is established chiefly
in London, Washington and Paris. Jones’s
scholarship is worth £6OO sterling, and
Stafford’s 3000 dollars.

ABORIGINALITIES
TTe had been sent to the N.S.W.
•**- country for a week and had been
down Tumut way. “And the sales!” he
exclaimed with rolling eyes. “I never
sold so many typewriter-ribbons in a
week in my life before. We have a new
pack, you know. They used to be in
boxes, but now we’re putting them up
like this.” He flashed a neat round
plastic container out of his brief-case.
His smile grew broader. “So useful for
the fishing. Everyone fishes- down there.
Wonderful!” —“Imperial 55.”

“Cyda”: In his interesting article on
sawdust, “Lillydale” (B. 28/10/’59)
missed one important use. Our Vic-
torian milk-condensery needs large quan-
tities of steam. Formerly using brown-
coal to fire the boilers, the management
now finds it profitable to cart sawdust
from mills up to 60 miles distant. Any
kind will do, but it is preferred with a
high moisture-content; otherwise it is
difficult to feed into the special grates
used. Several trucks of up to 20yds.
capacity arrive every day.

“Q. Ree”: It’s getting to the stage
where you can’t believe anything you
see in an American film. In “The Mating
Urge” the practice of men belonging to a
New Hebrides tribe of flinging them-
selves from towers up to 80ft. high, with
their ankles tied to vines, has been shown
as their way of wooing. Yet in an
authoritative article in a Pacific Islands
magazine a few months ago it is des-
cribed as a feat performed very rarely,
not more than every five years, and then
in honor of an old tribal legend. Until,
that is, the moviemen came and the
natives discovered how much the movie-
men were prepared to pay to photograph
the performance. Normally the men
wore only a loincloth and the women
danced bare-breasted, but moviemen
expect something for their money, includ-
ing wonderful costumes and something
more than an old legend.

“M.E.L.”: On the Prince’s Highway,
between the N.S.W. border and Orbost

commemorate some old-time quarrel,

2D: In support of Mr. R. A. McCallum
re “The Clancy Country” (B. 14 /10/ ’59)
. . . Some years ago in “The Sydney
Morning Herald,” in the “Granny”
column, the Hon. T. Mutch, M.L.A.,
replied to the query: “Where is The
Overflow?” He replied correctly. The
Overflow is 73 miles nor’-nor’-west of
Condobolin, 90 miles from Cobar, 26
from Nymagee and 64 miles from Nyn-
gan. A map of N. S. Wales at Spencer

it is also marked-in correctly as above.

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Inspectors are being
appointed in New Guinea to enforce
official control of quality standards for
export cocoa, which is becoming a major
factor in the Territory’s earnings. The
explanation is that, in view of the marked

it is vitally important to establish firmly
a reputation for quality—especially in
view of what happened a few years ago
to the desiccated-coconut industry.

“C. Coral”: “Q. Ree” (B. 21/10/’59),
on clothes-lack among women tourists
to Fiji, reminded me of a couple of
incidents of my Thursday Island days.
A big tourist-yacht puiled-in, owned by
a foreign count who was said to have
had large interests in Paris-underworld
establishments. The Count and some of
his satellites strolled round the town
with their lady friends, who were clad
in some sort of material which the
startled colored folk described as “glass
calico,” and which certainly concealed
nothing from plain view. The other time
THE WATTLE TREE
When I was small I heard a tale about
the wattle tree,
It was blind Mahommed A lam who told
the tale to me
As lost in childish wonderment l leaned
against his knee.
The moon, in time-of legend, was flirting
with the sun,
But he did not always see her for the
high-born one would run,
Gathering up her cloud-veils to her day-
time resting-place,
When she felt his eye upon her and saw
his beaming face.
The sun, with love and misery, grew
delicate and dim
And the trees, who were his comrades,
were very sad for him.
They said, “The moon is frivolous so we
must try to find
A way to help our brother. She is
thoughtless and unkind.'’
So one night when in the heavens the
moon was shining gay,
And she saw the sun approaching and
turned to run away,
A gaunt old tree stretched forth an arm
and caught her floating train—
She pulled and struggled angrily but it
was all in vain
For the gaunt tree held her firmly and
nearer drew the sun,
While all the world stood motionless and
watched to see the fun.
But the moon pulled hard so suddenly
she tore herself away,
She ran behind a cloud-bank and, bis-
millah ! it was day !
And when the sun arrived, too late, and
heard her hidden mirth
He rained in grief and hopelessness gold
tears upon the earth.
The trees in silent sympathy put up their
arms to him
And caught his tears forever on each
uplifted limb.

Oh from that far day of childhood two
memories I prize ;

it was an Austrian doctor and his wife,
who were doing malaria research. They
were nudists, and after the lugger con-
veying them to a station down the Gulf
had left from Thursday Island they went
below and re-emerged in nature’s garb,
without even a fig-leaf. The native
skipper had to stick to his tiller and
so could do nothing but fix his gaze in
another direction, feeling greatly em-
barrassed when one or the other of his
two white passengers asked a question.
The dark - skinned members of the
crew, all natives, ducked forward
and remained there, except when re-
quired to trim sails. The skipper told
me all about it later: “Them two white
people make us very ’shamed!” he said.

“Kelms”: Allan Kickok, vice-presi-
dent of the Kickok Corporation, one of
the world's largest makers of- belts, has
been in Australia organising supplies of
kangaroo-leather, which he classes as one
of the few wild-animal leathers still
available. It’s also one of the best; there
"Don't you know you're crossing the Line?"
are still moans from men who deplore
the passing of ’roo bootlaces, which were
fine and long and tough and worth
half-a-dozen made from bullock-hide.
Kickok thinks a market could be
developed for a wide variety of articles
made from ’roo-hide, and there’s no
doubt the name would help to sell them
in the U.S.

“Manamoi”; Editress of the women’s
page of a countrymen’s newspaper, reply-
ing to a suggestion that she should
publish a photo of herself, got out of it
gracefully by saying that to have your
picture in that particular paper you had
to be a pedigreed Shorthorn cow or
champion stud ewe. Right beside her
letter appeared a picture of a group of
angularly posed, models displaying the
new season’s swimsuits. Now, which
classification would they come under?
* * * *
“Fir”: Publicity has recently been
given here in N.Q. to the poisonous
properties of bryoni, a native vine of
the cucumber family, with specific warn-
ings to children. As kids we knew it
as “wild-melon,” because the green fruit
resembles tiny striped melons, turning
to a spectacular orange-red when ripe.
It possesses a repulsive smell, and it
would be a hardy youngster who’d have
a crack at it beyond the first sniff. A
vivid memory I hold is of dozens of
bullocks lying dead in a new paddock.
The blame was traced to either poison-
peach ( Trema ) or “melon,” both of
which grew there in plenty. It was an
outsize job clearing that 200-acre pad-
dock of these nuisances, with all hands
and the cook armed slashing at ’em
day after day for months. Incidentally,
we also dug-out thousands of harmless
bifield-ferns in the mistaken idea that
they were zamia (stagger-weed). I still
can't see a bifield-fern without shudder-
ing at the thought of all that back-
breaking, wasted labor!
4 * * *
“Alawa”: I’ve often thought that
driving a little N.Q. sugar-train, with its
gleaming brass funnels and domes, must
be hot, thirsty work ... While I was talk-
ing to a publican in his hotel near the
mill line, he stopped me to listen as the
whistle of an approaching train started to
blast. “Did that whistle blow three
times?” he asked. “I think so,” I replied.
“Good,” he said ; “that means two bottles
of beer. I’ll be back in a minute.” And
taking two bottles of beer he headed for
the source of the whistle.
• * * *
“Tabba”: Sump-oil seems to have
displaced some of the old bush nostrums.
I’ve seen it used on livestock for every-
thing from ringworm to mange, and
I know fellows who swear by it as a
cure for sunburn and for countering
dry-rot ; some even hopefully use it in
the battle against white-ants. And be-
cause, having served its original pur-
pose, it costs nothing, it is generally
used with great liberality. Examining
a Lameroo (S.A.) sheep-cocky's over-
head-gear, I asked him to start the motor.
He pulled the tumble-over cord, then
gave an enormous squirt of sump-oil on-
to the cogs at the top of down-tube.
As I stared in dismay at the row of
big black blobs on my white shirt, he
shot another great squirt in, looked at
my shirt, and said: “Aw, don’t worry
about that, it’ll come orf orright—it’s
clean sump-oil!”
* * * *
“Pieter Nuyts”: Here in W.A. this
summer I’ve handled more snakes and
lizards than in the previous three years
together, and every one has been tick-
infested. These aren’t the same species
as the kangaroo-tick, and there’s very
little risk of them attaching themselves
to humans or poultry. They seem to
specialise in reptiles, which are com-
pletely defenceless against them. I’ve
seen bobtail-lizards whose ears were full
of the vicious little bloodsuckers.

Just before the 40,000-ton liner Oriana
slid down her launching-ways three
magnums were broken over her bows.
One was Australian champagne, one
was Californian, and one English mead.
Innocent readers should beware of
assuming that the last-named is akin to
something Aunt Agatha used to concoct
casually but successfully, like her
parsnip-wine or black-currant cordial.
Basically a gleaning use of comb from
which the honey has been extracted,
mead-making seems mainly and meetly
in monkly hands, traditionally deft in
mellifluous tipples. Fr. Adam, of St.
Mary’s Abbey, Devon (who, we can't
help thinking, should brew a pretty
cider) sets-out as simply as possible in
about 3000 words the art of making a
mead-champagne such as was sloshed
to waste down Oriana’s stem.
Heather-, clover- or lime-honey is suit-
able. Sterilisation, fermentation with
maury wine-yeast, and close tempera-
ture-control call for great care, and to
ensure that the beverage will surpass
the finest wines from the juice of the
grape it is casked in oak for seven years.
For those of us who dilettante around
with a few do-it-yourself alcoholic com-
positions, it seems better that we con-
tinue to borrow a mason’s-jar from
Mum and screw the lid down on |lb.
cumquats, |lb. sugar and a half-bottle
of brandy, and label it resolutely: “Not
to be opened till Christmas.”
ANGUS McSCUPPER.


He’s grizzled aqd battle-scarred, and
his feet are killing him ; but he’s
more than worth his keep in the yards.
He doesn’t go mustering these days, but
snoozes with one ear cocked for the
returning mob. The leaders are nearly in
sight before he trots off to meet the cattle
and to help yard-up. The kids call him
“The Head Stockman.” —“Ikew.”

“An Chuidh”: The phrase “as tough
as old boots” may apply these days, but
in the days when the Highlanders wore
cuarans the story was different. A cuaran
was made by pulling the skin of an
animal hair-side out, around the foot.
By this means a shoe that fitted the foot
was assured, and being a species of raw-
hide had to be kept soft with wear and
grease. Says Alexander Carmichael, the
collector of folklore in the Hebrides: —-
A messenger came from Tongue House
to Dunrobin Castle, and being a messenger
of consequence, he placed his cuarans on
the dresser. The cook was indignant, but
like a wise woman held her counsel. When
the man asked for his cuarans to resume
his return journey, the cook asked him how
he liked his breakfast. “I never enjoyed
breakfast better,” replied the man. “Then,”
said the cook, “you have the satisfaction of
knowing that you carry your cuarans inside,
not outside you this time.. And never
you again take upon yourself to place your
upstart Gower cuarans on the dresser of
gentlefolk.”

“Murray Swagman”: If it’s terribly
dry at Nhill (Vic.) (B. 14/10/’s9>, it’s
worse in South Australia. The crops are
so low in some places the sparrows have
to go down on their knees to eat them.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: The old-time swag-
man wanting to get even with a stingey
squatter didn’t light that wax-match
before he dropped it (B. 7/10/’59). He’d
have been risking his life if he had;
if he escaped the flames (which is doubt-
ful) he’d have been picked-up by the
station-hands and treated on his merits.
What the squatter feared was a few
matches scattered around through his
grass. They might lie there for weeks
or months until a heatwave touched
them off ; by that time the swaggie was
miles away and free from suspicion.
Even more effective was placing the
vesta beneath a piece of glass so that
the noon sun hit it squarely. These facts
made the swaggie potentially dangerous
at. any time of the year, and probably
had a lot to do with establishing the
custom that a stranger was entitled to a
feed if he reached a homestead at
sundown.

“H.C.8.”: When my mate took his
broken set of crockery along for repairs
the dentist looked the plate over and
murmured: “H’mm, seems to me I’ve
seen these before.” The mate shook his
head. “Not them,” he said. “Those
grinders were made in Dubbo Camp by
an Army dentist ’way back in ’forty-
three, and this is the first time I’ve had
anything done to ’em.” A grin came to
the dentist’s phiz. “Not a bad unsolicited
testimonial. I made ’em. Look!” On
the roof of the palate the cut-in initials
were still discernible.

“Stromlo”: Northern Australian
buffaloes, now being exported in large
numbers to the Philippines and else-
where, either for work in the paddy-
fields or for the pot, came originally
from the islands to the northward. Little
use has been made of them here,
“Don't TOUCH it, Paul —there you have the perfect abstract!”
and their numbers have increased
enormously. The manager of a station
near Darwin, Keith Waldock, who has
tamed some 70 wild buffs within five
days, hopes to include them in 200 head
he is taking to Darwin this month for
export to Hong Kong. He believes an
attempt should be made to raise buffaloes
in conjunction with cattle. Old Territory
hands are awaiting the experiment with
interest.
* * * *
“Jock”: The famous Jenolan Caves
of N.S.W. could have derived their name
from one of two sources. Those who
claim that it comes from the aboriginal
name “Genowlan” have something on
their side, for there is a parish of
Genowlan thereabouts. Others hold that
the name marked the service in the
district last century of an Irish police-
man, Constable J. E. Nolan. There’s a
legend that cattle-duffers and horse-
thieves used the Devil’s Coach-house,
outside the caves, to corral their loot;
but it is more likely that when the caves
were being developed as a tourist-attrac-
tion 60-odd years ago rock-blasting was
necessary to provide a way into the
roofed-in Coach-house.

'T'he old-time bullock-driver had to be
J- something more than a fluent
swearer and long-whip wielder ; he
needed a colossal nerve and the cunning
of the dingo. To some extent, this was
forced on him by landowners. Everyone
wanted to employ the bullocky at one
time or another, but nobody wanted to
provide his team with feed.
Nothing, however, could defeat old Joe
Naylor, who used to operate in the
bottom corner of South Australia. Once,
when work was slack, he sneaked his
bullocks into a back-paddock of a sheep-
station near Mount Gambier, and it was
10 days before the owner knew they were
there. Whereupon he confronted Joseph
and roared: “Isn’t it about time you
shifted your blasted bullocks out of that
paddock?”
“Well, yes. I guess the feed is gettin’
a bit short in that one,” Joe agreed.
“Which of your paddocks should I put
’em in now?” Believe it or not, that
squatter was so rocked he let Joe’s team
have another week’s free grazing!
Again, Joe went to a land-owner and
asked permission to cut a strainer from
the timber in the creek-paddock. “Only
want the one,” he assured him, and the
squatter said: “Well, help yourself —
but only one, mind.”
Three days later the land-owner rode
across the creek-paddock and found his
biggest redgum felled and the trunk
gone. When he found Joe his furious
accusation was met with blank surprise.
“But you gave me permission!” Joe
protested.
“I said you could cut one post ”
“You said I could cut a strainer,” said
Joe, “and that’s just what it was. Me
bullicks nearly strained their tripe out
gettin’ that big log to the sawmill. Never
seen bullicks strain ’arder in me life! ”
The squatter rode-off to the police-
station, but the sergeant’s sympathies
Were with the teamster. “I’ll summons
him if you insist,” he said “but I doubt
if you’ll get a verdict. The court’s likely
to agree with old Joe’s definition of a
strainer, not yours.”

THE NEED FOR DOLLAR-PARTNERSHIP
'T'hat Australia will be wise
■*- to press for a partnership
with U.S. capital invested in
this country is clear from the
hostility aroused in Canada by
the increasing ownership of
Canadian industry by U.S.
investors.
As reported in the Van-
couver “Sun,” more than half
the profits of Canadian industry
belong to non-residents, mostly
American, Dr. John Davis,
head of the British Columbia
Electric research-department,
said at a seminar on Canada-
U.S. relations at the University
of B.C.
Davis said that about 60 per
cent, of all Canadian primary
and secondary industry, with
the exception of railroads and
utilities, is foreign-owned or
-controlled.
He said that within 20
years some two-thirds of all
profits from Canadian industry
could conceivably go to non-
resident stockholders.
Referring to the close link
between Canada and the U.S.,
he said that there are many
things the two countries have
in common.
“To the extent that we iden-
tify our own best interests
with those of our employers,
we, in this respect, are also
Americans,” Davis added.
Davis said that U.S. invest-
ment in Canada is known to be
approaching $l4 billion. (“If
I had a guess, I would put the
present market-value of U.S.
private investment in Canada
at around $2O billion.”) [A
Canadian billion is a thousand-
million.]
“It is getting on towards
$lOOO for every man, woman
and child in the 10 provinces,”
he said. “It is more than three
times our annual investment in
new industrial plant and equip-
ment ... It is about 10 times
the net savings of Canadian
individuals.”
Davis said that even if Cana-
dians devoted all of their per-
sonal savings to the task, it
would take at least a genera-
tion to buy the last American
investor out.
He added that to the extent
that profits are reinvested in
other Canadian undertakings,
they will still be a capital-asset
to Canada.
“Yet their very magnitude
may make it impossible for
future generations of Cana-
dians to get in on the ground-
floor, and to begin to buy-
back their national heritage.”
He said that Canadians are
not altogether oblivious to
these facts.
“How can they be, when the
subsidiaries of U.S. firms gen-
erally occupy larger plants,
use more machinery and equip-
ment and pay higher wages
than do their Canadian coun-
terparts?”
Davis said that whereas the
average investment in Cana-
dian manufacturing is $250,000,
the average plant built by U.S.
capital costs $2 million.
He said the outlook would
not be quite so frightening if
it were not for two things.
The American . corporations
are getting bigger. At the
same time they are consolidat-
ing their positions, buying-out
one Canadian firm after
another,
Davis cited several of the
complaints Canadians have
towards foreign-owned enter-
prises.
He said that three of every
four subsidiaries of foreign
companies in Canada are
wholly owned by large U.S.
firms. They do not sell stock
on their Canadian operation
to the public.
Mr. Davis added: “Cana-
dians might well ponder the
question as to whether a
country can have a meaning-
ful, independent existence in
circumstances where non-
residents hold the title to most
of the means whereby it earns
its livelihood.”
Canadian criticism, he said,
is founded on the premise that
when a company is located in
Canada, uses Canadian re-
sources and has protection of
Canadian laws, it should allow
Canadians to participate in its
direction and receive some of
the profits which it makes.
This line of reasoning has
been supported by no less
American authorities than
Bernard Baruch and William J.
Sebald, U.S. Ambassador to
Australia.
Commenting on Davis's
figures, the “Financial Post,”
Toronto, published a leader
headed: “Can We Survive U.S.
Investment?”
Metropolitan Cement
/Chairman Edward E.
Fortescue, of Metropolitan
Portland Cement, Ltd.,
reiterates the charge made by
C. R. McKerihan, of the
Rural Bank of N.S.W., that
criticism of the co.’s affairs has
affected sales, the co.’s pro-
portion of the N.S.W. market
having fallen from 14.3 p.c. to
11.6 p.c.
But nowhere is the subject of
production-costs dealt with in
the latest annual report, and
these appear to be the vital
factor. Admittedly a bigger
demand for the co.’s product
would provide it with more
scope for reduction in costs ;
but one of the first tasks of Mr.
O. H. Paton, the well-known
accountant who has recently
joined the board, should be to
determine whether costs of
production can ever be eco-
nomic through the plant that
the co. possesses, and with that
plant situated where it is.
At the annual meeting of the
co. on Nov. 11 the chairman
said that for 1956-57 sales of
cement totalled 123,975 tons ;
1957-58, 134,659 tons ; 1958-59,
107,258 tons. Sales were still at
depressed levels, and represen-
ted only 60 p.c. of capacity.
But the co. has secured the
contract to supply cement for
the Sydney Opera House.
The accounts for the year to
December 31, 1958, showed a
consolidated loss of £171,745,
after charging bank and deben-
ture interest of £176,272 and
depreciation of £82,422.
On top of this there was a
capital-loss of £168,227; and
a write-down of clinker
stocks by £149,378 followed
“temporary cessation of clinker-
production and consequential
reduction in the size of the
stockpile” which enabled the
board “to reassess its tonnage”
—apparently the farther you
were away from the stockpile
the bigger it looked, which is
not the usual optical illusion.

Then there had been £75,424
of interest on Norwegian plant
that had previously been
capitalised; this was brought
back into p. afid 1.
All told, the debit for the
year totted-up to £564,765,
which, added to the losses of
£870,097 already carried for-
ward, made total p. and 1. debit
£1,434,872.
Preliminary expenses and
establishment account total
£330,061 in addition, making
aggregate intangibles £1,764,933
at December 31, 1958. They
have already engulfed all the
paid capital of £1,004,306, .as
well as a proportion of the
overdraft owing to the Rural
Bank (£4,447,132 at December
31).
Since the close of accounts
aditional plant - realisations
have brought a further loss on
disposal of about £600,000;
this will carry the deficit up
to around £2,365,000 plus any
trading losses incurred con-
currently.
Clearly there is a colossal
financial hole that no mere
accounting expedients seem
likely to be able to fill. Just
what the co. has to offer any
potential takeover - company
that couldn’t be bought
cheaper and on a more modern
and efficient basis it is hard
to visualise on the evidence
offered by the accounts alone.
Transport of limestone from
Marulan to the works at
Maldon has always been a bug-
bear, and although arrange-
ments have been made for
rail-transport in place of road-
transport, this will not offer a
complete solution of the
problem.
Though the sharemarket
hopefully offers 2s. for Metro-
politan £1 shares, it is clear
that the Rural Bank of N.S.W.
is in the cement business in the
worst way.
Melbourne “HeraM”
TThe Melbourne sharemarket
seemed disappointed either
with the dividend announced
by Melbourne “Herald” last
week, or the lack of any
interesting announcement with
it.
Last year Herald and Weekly
Times, Ltd., paid 22\ p.c.,
and on capital since increased
by a one-for-two bonus the
company came up last Wednes-
day with a pay-out for the
year of 20 p.c., which seems
quite generous.
The shares fell shillings a
day after, having reached 48s.
previously, giving a return of
2.1 p.c., before the dividend
announcement.
The market’s reaction was
probably due to expectations
of capital-moves. There are
persistent rumors in Mel-
bourne of an intention to move
into, or buy into, the Sydney
newspaper field.
Gillespie Bros. Holdings
the weakening of
Gillespie Bros. Holdings
new fully-paid 10s. shares to
235. 6d., interest is likely to be
aroused in them again.
The 10s. shares at last
balance-date had a net tangible
backing of 19s. per share in
assets which were not written-
up for the purpose of the
recent flotation—and the busi-
ness goes back to the last
century. Plant has been liber-
ally written-down.
Last year’s disclosed earnings
were equal to 22 p.c. on paid
capital as it stood at the end
of the year, but this figure
included only so much of the
profit earned during the year
by Mowbray Pty., Ltd., the
Daffodil-margarine concern, as
was distributed —no account is
taken of ploughed-back marga-
rine earnings in either the p.-
and-1. account or in asset-back-
ing.
Since balance-day there has
been a one-for-three issue by
Gillespie’s of new 10s. shares
at par, which will lift paid
capital to £550,000. Also, a
debenture-loan of £150,000 has
been raised as well.
Originally a flourmiller only,
diversification of interests in
recent years has paid-off, and
capital-expansion during the
current year indicates the con-
fidence of the management in
its new ventures.
There are tax-free reserves
equal to 16 p.c. on the new paid
capital, and last year’s earnings
were equal to 9.3 p.c. on the
current market price.
Dividend last year was a
comfortably covered 8 p.c., half
of it tax-free.
The shares look as if they
would well repay holding for
a few years.

on Misima Island, in the Territory of Papua, some 650 miles North-east
of Cairns, Queensland.
The gold lodes at Misima are the largest and most extensive vet dis-
covered in Papua—New Guinea and gold to the order of £3,000,000 was
produced prior to World War 11.
The Bureau of Mineral Resources, a division of the Commonwealth
Department of National Development, commenced a geological survey
of the Island in May this year. Application has been made to the
Department of Lands, Surveys and Mines, Port Moresby, to carry out a
detailed programme of diamond and churn drilling on behalf of this
Company.
As large areas are suitable for open-cut mining, it is the intention
of the Company to employ the most efficient earth-moving equipment
available.

there were shallow and did not
persist in depth. He said
B.H.P. had spent £200,000
in the Iron Range area, adding
a hope that the co. would take
out a bulk trial parcel of
20,000 tons of ore for testing
in blast-furnaces. Of Con-
stant Range, also being pros-
pected by 8.H.P., Evans said
a 150-mile rail line to the
coast would be needed to get
the ore out. Iron Range is
230 miles north of Cooktown ;
Constant Range 150 miles
north-west of Mt. Isa.
Tasmanian Board Mills
"Profit-earning by Tasmanian
A Board Mills, Ltd. (now a
misnomer), has been improv-
ing ; for 1958-59, after
£47,392 of depreciation, the
consolidated net figure was
£136,385, compared with
£35,880 in the preceding term.
In neither term was taxation
charged in the accounts, since
accumulated losses at June 30
last still totalled £531,044.
Improvement in trading-
results has been apparent over
the past two years. Since dis-
posal of the container-board
plant in 1955 the timber divis-
ion has shown recovery, but
interest charges on the residual
plant and freeholds have been
a burden.
Fixed assets in the consoli-
dated accounts total £1,168,545.
Of these, freeholds at £293,777
and plant at £212,888 are relics
of the container division. With
accumulated losses of £531,044,
other intangibles of £156,839,
and £506,665 of dormant or
moribund assets (amounting to
£f, 194,548, all told), the
remaining net assets (fixed and
floating) do well to support
a paid capital of £1,370,000 (all
but £50,000 of it in ords.) and
show a profit before tax of
£136,385 last year.
There is a bank-overdraft of
£747,992 in total ordinary
creditors, etc., of £846,287.
Then there are also long-term
mortgages of £220,253.
Earning-power of the timber
division appears to be quite
high, on the latest figures. If
similar profits can be shown
for the next four years they
could put a different complex-
ion on the co.’s finances and
make the ord. shares, now at
7s. 9d., a comparatively interes-
ting long-term spec.
The bank-overdraft was
worked-down from £1,601,233
at June 30, 1955, to £1,064,178
two years later following the
sale of the container-board
plant. Since then it has been
reduced to the present
£747,992.
Profit-and-loss debit has
dropped from £826,787 to
£531,044 since 1955.
Whakatane
A ccounts of Whakatane
Board Mills confirmed a
30 per cent, rise in profit at
£202,460 for the year, though
depreciation was £16,630 higher
at £331,255. Sales of card-
board, timber and pulp were
6 per cent, up, passing the £3-
million mark for the first time.
Earning-rate on shareholders’
funds rose from 7.4 per cent,
to 9.2 per cent. The 8 per
cent. ord. div. is covered just
over twice.
The co. is now considering
the installation of a third card-
board-machine and a pilot-
plant for bleaching semi-
chemical pulp. The bleach-
ing-unit might be the fore-
runner of a major installation.
Mt. Isa Loan
'T'he political football-game
for the Mt. Isa railway
loan, has ended in a victory for
the Queensland Government.
Following loan-offers from
overseas as well as local
sources, the Federal Govern-
ment came to the rescue with
an offer to raise the necessary
£29 million on the local market.
The funds will be used for the
reconstruction of the Mt. Isa-
Cloncurry rail-link.
The way is now clear for the
planned expansion of Mt. Isa
Mines, Ltd., to be carried-out.
Production of 8000 tons a day
will be lifted to an estimated
14,000 tons.
Southport Hotel

Hotel is still being keenly

Although a small profit of
£13,578 (equivalent to 6.39 p.c.
on capital) was earned in the
last financial period, current
liabilities stand at £212,793 on
a capital of £316,578.

Stage and Music
“King Lear”
Many writers have argued
that “Lear,” being essentially
less dramatic than poetic,
belongs more to the imagina-
tion than to the stage, and
that ordinary stage-methods, by
making the eye dictator to the
mind, will always work to some
extent against a full realisa-
tion of the play.
The argument is probably
sound. But the eye’s dictator-
ship need not, of course, be
absolute. Imaginative settings,
lighting and costumes can
loosen the ropes that bind us
to earth and fact; and, above
all, the packed and ranging
language, if delivered with
passion and subtlety, can at
least start its strange universe
heaving before the mind’s eye.
It was on just these counts
that John Alden’s final produc-
tion with the J.C.W. Shakspeare
Company at Sydney Royal
failed to offer more than
glimpses of the Lear vision.
Its chief interest lay in the
contrast between the Lears
created on alternate nights by
John Laurie and Alden himself.
Laurie started his version
cunningly, with brief hints of
mental infirmity passing early
across his face like clouds in a
wind. His descent into madness
was rapid and detailed, but
once there he seemed unable
to rise out of the chaos of the
storm to the heights of pity and
agony (this was partly the pro-
ducer’s fault: the Mad Tom
scenes were full of distracting
gabble and balletics). But once
madness had shaken the will
out of him and he had entered
that strange region of insight
into the deceits of the world
and the simplicity of sheer
goodness, he was moving and
noble—nowhere more so than
in the last scene, where the
release after the final snap of
his heart over the dead Cordelia
was almost blissful.
His portrait as a whole may
have lacked height and weight,
but it left no aspect unsuggested
or unintegrated ; and it care-
fully preserved the tragic link
between character and fate.
It was just this tragic link
that John Alden, despite his
stronger projection, failed to
suggest on the following night.
He did almost everything
possible with the facts of the
part, but little with the soul
beneath them ; and at the end
he was simply an old king
repenting and dying.
Both these actors, however,
could teach their colleagues
much about the delivery of
poetry. Apart from Anthony
Bazell, as a quiet and bewil-
dered Gloucester, and, less
certainly, Leonard Bullen, as a
firm and blunt Kent, the rest
of the players tended to
scramble across the surface of
the language, leaving far too
much of it unexplored.
Jessica Noad’s Goneril,
Fernande Glyn’s Regan and
John Frawley’s Cornwall were
never elemental enough in their
sadism and viciousness ; John
Unicomb’s Edmund was a
naughty athlete, showing little
of real menace and nihilism ;
and Terry McDermott, as
Albany, watched their activ-
ities with sizeable dismay and
disgust.
As the Fool on the first night,
William Austin was simply
timid and pathetic; Barry
Lovett, on the second night,
had more of telling sharpness
in his wit; but neither player
could find a satisfactory focus
for the part.
Edward Brayshaw, as Edgar,
struck a set of wholesome
attitudes, entirely missing the
religious streak that alone will
make Edgar’s strange behavior
credible ; and Mavis Turner’s
Cordelia, though it avoided the
charge of mere priggish virtue,
failed to suggest the inarticulate
and defenceless love that brings
a wilful king to his knees.

Mahler in Brisbane
Nothing is so vital to a lively
musical scene as controversy,
and not many composers have
managed to create as much
controversy as Gustav Mahler.
Rudolf Pekarek turned the
final concert of the Queens-
land Orchestra’s main season
into one of the most important
of the year by playing the
Mahler Fourth Symphony, the
gentlest of the whole series of
nine. Even though “centenary”
is becoming a tiresome word in
Brisbane, Pekarek was looking
forward to the 1960 centenary
of Mahler’s birth in paying his
homage to this giant of the
orchestra.
Though he died in 1911,
Mahler’s reputation only now
is beginning to grow rapidly:
he might have composed with
the long-playing record in
mind; and a new, unbiased
generation of music-lovers is
at hand to listen.
Mahler’s symphonies are
frankly and unashamedly long ;
nevertheless, they grow upon
the hearer who is willing to
penetrate the interwoven
themes, for this music yields up
its riches much as good poetry
reveals new layers of meaning
after long acquaintance.
Mahler, like Berlioz, was
guilty of revelling in the sound
of a mighty orchestra ; and
when you add to this his con-
tempt for the tight jackets of
form it is easy to see why he
has always given the fustier
type of academic feelings of
horror and discomfort.
His Fourth Symphony begins
with the jingle of sleigh-bells,
travelling from this festive
atmosphere to a Breughel-like
vision of Heaven described by
a soprano in the last move-
ment. The orchestra took the
measure of the music quickly,
and by the time the ’cellos
reached their first superb tune
an air of affection had settled
over the playing. Mahler may
have loved a big orchestra, but
he had a tactician’s understand-
ing of the importance of keep-
ing forces in reserve. Often
in the sustained lyricism of the
slow movement small groups
of instruments give the effect
of chamber-music. This in
turn makes the great outbursts
from full orchestra all the more
unexpected in richness of
sound.
The many solo opportunities
were used to the full, especially
by the horns and by flute-
leader James Carson, whose
tone rang clearly above the
orchestra. George White’s
nimble exchange of his violin
for one tuned higher (for
ghostly effects) was a neat piece
of sleight-of-hand as well as
effective spookery. Finally,
Heather McMillan shed most
of her usual sophistication in
the coy little final song, sound-
ing the last note of loveliness

D.J.M.
Subscription Concert
The final Sydney concert of
the 1959 subscription-series
was an all-Beethoven affair.
Starting with the “Prome-
theus” overture, Dr. Malko
showed that he would stand
no nonsense in such matters as
tempo; this assertion tended
to let him down in the D
Major Violin Concerto, in
which the first movement was
taken at perhaps too deliberate
a speed. French violinist Devy
Erlih sketched his part with
watercolor fineness, but except
for brief moments —notably in
the elaborate first-movement
cadenza and in the passages
following—he missed much of
the rich broadness so vital to
this work
There was a pleasant orches-
tral concentration on detail:
certain recurrent phrases were
carefully etched ; and the final
movement gave Erlih a chance
to display technique coupled
with generally unemotional
interpretation.
The Seventh Symphony,
done with most proper atten-
tion to its outstanding rhyth-
mic qualities, was a first-class
bit of playing, with the strings
straining at their leash, and
the woodwinds, notably in their
scherzo figure, nicely controlled.
Some of the brass-playing
might have been tidier.
Artbursls
Norman Lindsay
After years of staying practi-
cally invisible in the Blue
Mountains, communing with
gods and gardeners and seldom
exhibiting a painting to show he
was still incessantly working,
Norman Lindsay has lately
made welcome reappearances
in Sydney: last year with a
show of etchings, now again
at David Jones’ (until
November 20) with a display of
oils and watercolors.
This exhibition is not, like
the etchings-show, the recapi-
tulation of a single period and
a summary of his work at his
greatest in one medium. It is,
essentially, simply a working
exhibition, mostly of recent
vintage.
But a display of some of his
books—the oils, the water-
colors, the etchings, the pen-
drawings—with one of his ship-
models, a couple of pieces of
his sculpture, and two or three
of his oils from an earlier
period, notably the superbly
vital “The Sisters,” give at
least an indication of his
copiousness and versatility.
If anybody wants a simple
measure of his achievement it
is provided in the piece of
driftwood which has fortun-
ately been left decorating one
side of the dais, while on the
other side is the plaster-model
for the mermaid riding the sea-
horse which decorates his fish-
pond at Springwood: one,
which could almost pass for
a work of art these days, is
just a nice hunk of driftwood ;
the other, deriving from Greek
mythology, is the embodiment
of thousands of years of civili-
sation.
Illustrating his favorite
themes and moods —from the
fierce, demonic quality of
“Mad Tom” with the sky full
of witches and devils, to the
Rabelaisian gaiety of “The
Rajah at Home” and “Guests
to the Castle” and the simple,
.pastoral happiness of “Stroll-
ing” and “Afternoon” —the
paintings demonstrate once
again how firmly Norman
Lindsay has created his own
unique world. Not one of
them, though they vary in
quality, is without that stamp
of individuality, sometimes
forceful and sometimes charm-
ing, that makes it a collector’s
piece.
Some of this commentator’s
favorites among them are
“Cavern of Mystery,” a soft,
probably, early watercolor of
nudes coming out of a great
cleft in the rock ; “The High
Constable’s Wife,” a recent
excursion into one of the more
sinister of Balzac’s “Contes
Drolatiques,” very effective in
its treatment of wood and stone
in the old castle ; “The Lace
Drape,” a graceful small study
of his favorite model. “To the
Feast,” a carnival of gypsies in
rich afternoon light;
“Pegasus,” with the white-
winged horse in the sky ; “Sea
Maids,” for the little mermaid
in the pale-green sea; and,
especially, “Venus Trium-
phant,” which simultaneously
illustrates the core of his philo-
sophy, is a most lively collec-
tion of ladies and doves and
mandolin-players and leopards
and, with the yellow and pale-
lemon of the leopard picked-up
again in Venus’s blonde hair
and carried throughout the
painting in draperies and sky-
tints, shows the great care and
technical virtuosity that go into
these masterly watercolors.
<♦ ♦>
Twelve Guineas and Under
In this Christmas show of
paintings at Farmer’s (Sydney)
the range and quality of real-
istic subjects, both in oils and
watercolors, is slight enough to
justify the charge of poor total
balance, even allowing for the
generally fresh impact of the
abstracts.
Margo Lewers has two
“Composition” abstracts, un-
pretentious and controlled;
W. Peascod’s careful dabblings
with squares and quiet colors
add-up to an appealing “City” ;
Judy Hepper’s “Figures Three”
is mild, blue and at once recog-
nisable ; John Coburn has

“North By North-west”
Alfred Hitchcock, the master
of suspense, is at the top of
his form in this serio-comic,
ingenious and top-paced con-
trivance about a gang of spies
who invent a character to put
the F. 8.1. off their trail and,
when an advertising_-salesman
adventurously adopts the per-
sonality, set-about trying in
divers ways to bump him off.
The salesman, however,
stubbornly refuses to become
a corpse, for, as he says, two
ex-wives, several bookmakers
and barmaids, the taxation
people and sundry others are
counting on his continued
existence.
Hitchcock complicates the
salesman’s task of tracking-
down the gang against time by
pinning a murder on him,
thereby forcing him to dodge
the law as well as the spies.
The gang’s attempt to murder
the salesman by luring him
into a vast cornfield and
attacking him with a crop-
dusting biplane is cream of
Hitchcock; and there is a
clinking climax among the like-
nesses of U.S. Presidents
carved in the Dakota rocks.
Cary Grant is first-rate as
the unruffled fugitive. James
Mason, as the gang-leader, and
Eva Marie Saint, as a femme
fatale, give solid support.

“Golden Age of Comedy”
With the notable exception
of Chaplin, all the most skilled
practitioners of mime and slap-
stick are represented in this
90-minute paste-up, of snippets
from the most uproarious
sequences of the custard-pie
era—Laurel and Hardy, baby-
faced Harry Langden, Ford
Sterling and Charlie Murray
(two Keystone stalwarts), and
Will Rogers.
It also gives an indication of
the high standard of direction
by the comedy - contrivers,
like Hal Roach, who found
primitive equipment no bar to
first-rate laugh-making. A
smooth commentary binds the
parts together.

“But Not For Me”
Clark Gable drafts a neat
piece of light-comedy in this
backstager, which is in effect
a vehicle for his none-too-
dignified departure from
romantic roles (he is now 56).
When his young, susceptible
secretary falls heavily for a
suave Broadway producer he
cynically uses the idea to turn
an unsuccessful show into a
hit, with the secretary as lead-
ing lady. The incidental
polished comedy owes as much
to sophisticated dialogue as to
situations.
Gable, still very much the
authoritative hunk of man,
enters into the bantering spirit
of it, with Carroll Baker and
Lee J. Cobb in firm support.

Mutual Life and Citizens*
Tn our times of rising living-standards,
accompanied by high cost-of-living
and high taxation, the individual finds
it difficult to make adequate provision
for some degree of security on his re-
tirement, or to set something aside for
his dependants upon, his (often prema-
ture) death.
Thus far, a good life-policy, taken-
out with a sound life-office which pays
regular bonuses, has been an almost ideal
solution to this problem. In addition,
the savings effected in the meantime by
payment of premiums participate in the
growth of national economy, spreading
indirect benefits all round. The Govern-
ment has consistently encouraged the
growth of life-assurance by tax-conces-
sions. The last Budget raised the maxi-
mum deduction allowable to one person
for life-assurance premiums paid to £4OO
a year.
Mutual Life and Citizens’ Assurance
Co., Ltd., enjoys an established reputa-
tion for its generous reversionary-bonus
policy. Last year the co. was able to
declare new bonus-rate increases in both
the life and industrial branches. Bonus-
rates are now at least 50 p.c. higher
than they were five years ago. In the
case of a few policies they are as much
as 100 p.c. higher.
Founded in 1886 as the Citizens’ Life
Assurance Co., The M.L.C. is one of
Australia’s largest assurance-offices. The
co. writes ordinary, industrial and
accident policies throughout Australia,
and in N. Zealand, Canada and the U.K.
It was the first major life-office to follow
the trading-banks into hire-purchase
business, acquiring a 44.4 p.c. share-
interest in Alliance Holdings, Ltd., by
taking-up 4,000,000 ss. ords. in June,
1958.
Sound financial structure and good
management, with a keen invest-
ment policy aided by a moderate ex-
pense-rate, have enabled The M.L.C. to
keep its prominent position in the
assurance-field. When the full benefits
of the newly-completed mechanisation
of clerical procedures are felt, the
expense-ratio should show considerable
improvement.
The trend towards whole-of-life
assurance observed in the previous term
continued, but to a greater extent in
N.Z. than in Australia. Group and
superannuation plans were . popular.
Accident and sickness new - business
showed a 25 p.c. increase over that for
1957. Last term the co. wrote 63,891
new life-policies, assuring £66,498,655
(exclusive of temporary assurances), and
76,568 new industrial policies, assuring
£12,113,871. The total number of life-
policies in force at December 31, 1958,
was 1,645,394, assuring (with bonuses)
the sum of £574,046,211:

The total new business written in Aus-

another record for the co.
Total income increased by £1,938,202
to £20,709,864 in the ordinary
branch and by £290,908 to £5,809,224
in the industrial section. Claims paid-
out to ordinary policyholders went up
by £649,934 to £6,040,001. The indus-
trial branch paid £2,501,680 in claims

The O.D. expense-rate was a shade lower
at 16.21 p.c. Calculated on the total
income the rate was 12.08 p.c. (28.92
p.c. on premium-income and 22.02 p.c.
on total income in the industrial branch).
Funds and reserves increased by
£13,766,760 to £155,167,283.
Total net surplus for 1958 was £720,682
higher at £5,472,605:

Bonuses allotted to policyholders come
from favorable mortality, low expenses
and remunerative investment—showing-
up together in the excess of assurance
funds over actuarial liabilities. The
latter were calculated on a stringent 2\
p.c. basis for ordinary policies and 2
p.c. for industrial policies.
The surplus in the general branch,
which works for the shareholders, was
£21,966 smaller at £139,080, or 13.9 p.c.
on the £1,000,000 share-capital (down
2.2 p.c.). Shareholders, who may par-
ticipate in up to 15 p.c. of the divisible
earnings of the life departments, guaran-
tee to conduct the ordinary department
at an expense-rate no greater than 15
p.c. of its total income. Similar pro-
visions apply to the industrial branch
of the business.
The div.-rate was raised from 27y p.c.
to 28| p.c. Sellers asked £lO for The
M.L.C. 20s. (unlisted) shares, making
the yield 2.8 p.c.
Mutual Life and Citizens’ substantially
increased its investment in commerce
and industry in 1958. Holdings of deben-
tures increased by £1.2 million, notes
in public cos. by £l.l million, prefs. and
ords. in various concerns by £3.4 million.
The co. continued to lend large
amounts to building-societies and in-
creased its loans on mortgages by £5.7
million to £50,912,597, or 31.3 p.c. of
its assets. Holdings of Government,
semi-government and municipal securi-
ties dropped , from 39.4 p.c. to 35.5 p.c.
of the total assets. There were only
small variations in other components of
the investment-portfolios:

was its recent branching-out into general

Bradford Cotton Mills, Ltd.
Conceived in 1927 and graduating to
public status in 1935, Bradford
Cotton has never once failed, since list-
ing, to pay divs. of 10 p.c., or more, and
in the last six years the rate has been
held at 12y p.c.
Consequent on difficult trading condi-
tions —severe competition from imported
fabrics and erratic market demand —con-
solidated net profit fell last term from
the previous year’s highest ever, to
£537,741 (down £45,142). The chairman,
in his annual report, states that, “having
regard to all the circumstances, the aggre-
gate income for the year must be con-
sidered satisfactory,” and that the previ-
ous years’ - records “reflected additional
business, chiefly from Government
departments, which was not repeated in
the year under review.”
Profit was struck after setting aside
£329,390 (down £88,459) for tax and
£429,818 (down £71,019) for deprecia-
tion, and was equivalent, after satisfac-
tion of Ist and 2nd £1 6 p.c. cum. prefs.
(60,000 shares and 93,104 shares respec-

The B.C.M. group comprises 11
wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the
recently acquired Burlington Mills
(Aust.) Pty.—last term 8.C.M., already
the principal shareholder in this co.,
completed purchase of all shares not
previously held. Primarily a spinner and
weaver —plants operate in N.S.W. and
Victoria, spinning the coarser counts of
cotton-yarn and weaving industrial and
heavy-duty cotton cloths (drills, denims,
tweeds, canvas and duck) —the group also
engages in doubling, dyeing, weather-
and rot-proofing, flame-proofing and
compressive shrinking (sanforizing), and
has extensive interests in the rayon-
spinning industry. B.C.M. also had a
50 p.c. interest in Chattanooga Tufted
Carpets (Aust.) Pty., but sold-out earlier
this year to co-partner Felt and Textiles
of Australia, Ltd.
Industrial expansion, so prominent to-
day in Australia’s growing economy, is
not for the present so apparent in the
textile industry, and growth potential as
applied to B.C.M. must be discounted
accordingly. Apart from share-issues to
employees, progressive absorption of
Burlington Mills has been the only factor
contributory to the slow building-up of
the co.’s paid capital. In recent years
new share-issues have been conspicuously
absent, the last such issue being made in
1951, when 733,261 ords. were offered to
shareholders in the ratio of two-for-five
and then at a premium of 10s.
Changing fashions and new material
requirements call for constant modernisa-
tion of plant, and economics of plant-
installation must be tempered by keen
appreciation of consequences of latent
obsolescence. Management must be ever
vigilant as to the impact of future trends.
During the year the co.’s policy of replac-
ing obsolescent plant was fully imple-
mented. New plant of latest design was
added to existing mills to supplement
equipment already in use. In Victoria
additions were made to spinning, weav-
ing and finishing units. Waste-plant was
completed at Kotara (N.S.W.) and pro-
ductive capacity at Rutherford Mills
(N.S.W.) was increased. New modern
dyeing- and finishing-equipment was
installed in the Burlington mill to enable
processing of latest types of synthetic
yarns, and, in the furnishing mill further
looms were added to broaden the range
of furnishing fabrics.
As a measure of fixed-asset increment,
balance-sheet figures show hefty increases
—freeholds are up £71,466 at £2,822,240
and plant is up £424,802 at £7,604,096.
As a measure of absolute investment,
however, final figures tend to understate
actual equity; this in the absence of
recent revaluations. Provision for de-
preciation looms huge at £4,244,766 (up
£300,713).
Creditors were lower at £1,576,570
(down £80,803) and overdraft jumped
£421,925 to £1,503,012. Stock was down
£84,522 (at £4,378,255), but debtors out-
standing (£2,097,597) were up £203,566.
In all, theoretical working-capital slipped
only £104,160 and at £2,837,351 main-
tained a nice liquidity:

The current term should see only
moderate change in B.C.M.’s profits. A
small rise or a small fall may take place,
but movement in either instance will not
be spectacular. Production figures for
the three months to August 31 are an
improvement on those for the same
period of 1958. Some sections of the
cotton-weaving industry are reporting
slackness, but, on the whole, production
should remain around last year’s level.
Spinners, on the other hand, face fierce
competition from Asian countries. Hong
Kong and China are making tentative
approaches, and Japan continues to bring
substantial exports to the local market.
This is particularly so in the case of
rayon and similar fibres and has necessi-
tated partial curtailment of operations by
B.C.M. at its rayon-mill, near Maitland
(N.S.W.).
The Japanese Government agreed last
month to limit the export of man-made
fibre piecegoods to Australia to eight-
million square-yards a year (the relevant
1958-59 total was 8.5 million), and it has
been decided, further, that the whole
question of protection for the industry
will be subject to re-examination by the
Tariff Board. In the period pending the
inquiry, imports of rayon, etc., will be
controlled according to the provisions
of the Trade Agreement between the two
countries.
Though lacking immediate appeal as a
dynamic growth-stock, investors should
not overlook B.C.M.’s proven ability to
consistently hand-out worth-while divs.
The co.’s unblemished record in this
respect makes purchase of the 20s. ords.
a very reasonable proposition at the
current ’Change valuation of 38s. Iyd.,
and if the shares are presently depressed

Streets Ice Cream, Ltd.
Pounded at Corrimal
(N.S.W.) in 1920, Streets
was converted into a public co.
in 1952, and in the ensuing
seven years succeeded in win-
ning for itself a deservedly
high rating on ’Change and a
major share of the N.S.W. ice-
cream market.
One of the leading ice-
cream manufacturers in
N.S.W., and certainly one of
the most progressive in Aus-
tralia, the co. operates branches
at Turrella, Parramatta, Pen-
rith, Brookvale (all near Syd-
ney), and at Corrimal, Moruya,
Goulburn, Wagga, Newcastle
and Gosford. In 1950 Lynam’s
Ice Cream Pty.—a valuable
unit—was acquired.
During the term ended June
30, 1959, Streets continued to
expand its activities. A new
wholly-owned subsidiary, Am-
bassador Refrigeration Pty.,
was formed to provide
customers with commercial
refrigeration-units. An attrac-
tive new showroom and work-
shops are being built on two
acres of land adjoining Streets’
factory at Turrella. In the
meantime the subsidiary is
located in temporary quarters
in Arncliffe.
A distribution-depot has
been established at Nowra to
consolidate the co.’s position
in that area.
Trade conditions were, on
the whole, favorable last term,
and turnover increased by
£100,924 to £2,117,991. How-
ever, price-adjustments were
necessary during the year to
defray increases in production
and distribution costs. Busi-
ness in the first quarter of the
current term was reported to
be satisfactory.

The result was achieved after
writing-off £115,192 for depre-

£107,000 (down £2000) for

The funds-statement reveals a
£73,771 decrease in net work-
ing-capital, used to finance
part of the £290,545 addition
to fixed assets.
Stock was £12,282 higher,
and, being of a perishable
nature, reflected the increase in
turnover. Debtors fell by
£22,944 to £60,848, and cash
and bond-holdings by £62,842
to £50,372. No recourse was
made to bank-accommodation,
and all expansion was financed
internally.
In spite of the fall in
working-capital to £22,372,
liquidity was satisfactory, with
a current ratio of nearly 1.1
to 1. Net tangible backing is
£2 4s. 6d. a 20s. ord.
During the year the nominal
capital was increased to
£2,000,000. Although at that
stage the co. made it clear that
no immediate bonus or cash
issues were anticipated, it is
not unlikely that Streets’ steady
growth will justify a fresh issue
of scrip in the not-/00-distant
future.
Possibly because of these
“great expectations” (and
thanks to the healthy div.-rate),
the sharemarket continues to
offer a handsome price for
Streets’ stock. The 20s. ords.
last changed hands at 68s. 6d.
a unit, making the yield 4.1
p.c. on the basis of a steady 14
p.c. dividend (without the 1
p.c. loading). But it is quite
obvious from the co.’s earn-
ing-capacity and high rate of
profit - pioughback that it
could easily afford a higher
rate as soon as the need for
capital-outlay eases. Its book-
values generally are already
snug, as is clear from the
liberal depreciation provisions
each year and the declared
policy of keeping plant up to
the most modern standard
possible.
Peko Mines, N.L.
At the annual meeting of
Peko interest' was dis-
played in the Orlando gold
prospect, about 23 miles west
of the Peko Coppermine at
Tennant Creek (N.T.).
From the reported remarks
of chairman A. S. P. Sangster,
it is believed that the shaft
has been sunk to 420 ft., this
probably being 30ft. or 40ft.
below the proposed plat.
The Peko people do every-
thing very thoroughly, and it
can be taken for granted that
the plat at the new level will
be cut to the full dimensions
required, securely timbered and
equipped with pumps. On the
completion of this work, a full-
sized crosscut, probably Bft.
by Bft., will be driven to inter-
sect the lode-channel. After
this, “several-hundred feet of
driving will be required to
reach the zone penetrated by
the drilling.”
Assuming that the plat will
be cut and timbered by early
December, the crosscut
should reach the lode-channel
some time in January, and
driving along it could be on
the way in February.
Until this driving on the
channel commences, there will
be little of interest to the share-
holder.
It is known that the Peko
Co. is reasonably sure of gett-
ing sufficient ore from the pre-
liminary operations at Oilando
to at least repay capital-out-
lay.
Shareholders are interested to
know to what they can aspire.
The answer is that if Orlando
eventually proves to be a rich
gold-lode on the top ievels and
a rich copper-lode at depth, it
could supply enough profit
from the top levels to provide
the money for a copper-smelter.
This would, indeed, put Peko
on the map.
The market for the shares
has, no doubt, been influenced
by the very pronounced local
optimism at Tennant Creek.
Whether this is justified or not
only development will tell.
In the meantime, the price of
copper is firming steadily
because of the protracted
strikes in Chile and U.S.A. If
these strikes are prolonged, the
price of copper could go higher,
and this could help the finan-
cial position of Peko.

British Petroleum
the many books dealing
with the search for oil, it
is remarkable that a volume
written by an author who
gained fame as golf-corre-
spondent to London’s “Sunday
Times” should be at once the
most readable and the most
factual, although, in the main,
it recounts the activities of
only one company.
To write Adventure in Oil
(Sidgwick and Jackson), Henry
Longhurst obviously has gone
very carefully through the files
of the company concerned, but
he has leavened the official
information with his own on-
the-spot impressions. His per-
sonal knowledge of the
countries visited dates back, at
earliest, only to 1945, but he
has brought the past into
brilliant—and on some occa-
sions, too vivid —relief.
As is inevitable in any
account dealing with oil in the
Middle East, the scene opens
with the Morgan brothers and
William Knox D’Arcy; and,
for the first time in my recollec-
tion, fairly adequate tribute
is paid to G. B. Reynolds. I'd
hate to imagine, however, what
G.B.’s reaction would have
been to seeing himself de-
scribed as “one of the great
unsung heroes in the history
of oil.” Nor do I think that
Arnold Wilson would be over-
joyed at the broadcasting to
the general public of the extract
front his diary where he wrote,
after his first experience of a
Persian summer, “I had hoped
to be out of this blasted country
at the end. of the spring.”
“Five - per - cent” Gulbeu-
kian’s opinion of D’Arcy is
that he was “considered a
great pioneer of the oil
industry, but to tell the truth
he was a great gambler, and
his success was due to sheer
luck rather to any industrial
or economic foresight.”
D’Arcy’s estimate of Mr
“Five-per-cent” is not given.
M. Y. Young (the little
doctor), who did so much for
the Persian oil pioneers and
for the Persians themselves,
takes up a chapter of well-
deserved praise.
The rapid develoment of the
search for oil in the Middle
East in the early ’twenties
brought its troubles, of course,
particularly as there was an
understandable disinclination
on the part of non-American
companies to rely too much
on U.S. technicians. The
Americans had, admittedly
much greater experience and
know-how, but many of them
accepted oilfield jobs in foreign
companies, at relatively low
pay, with the object of acting
as “scouts” for U.S. organisa-
tions.
The British companies, there-
fore, engaged engineers and
geologists for work in the
Middle East who had, per-
force, no previous experience
in oil. That they carried on
at all can be ascribed to the
British genius for improvisa-
tion ; a study of the reports
issued during that period brings
the realisation of how a
comedy of errors very nearly
resulted in the tragic wreck-
ing of a great enterprise.
When conditions tightened,
in the mid-’twenties, the sur-
plus non-specialists were dis-
charged, but the company went
to great pains to find them
jobs elsewhere. It was this
reviewer’s misfortune to have
to put up with some of them.
Once the company’s teeth-
ing troubles were over, how-
ever, its record of perform-
ance, not only in Persia but in
oil regions the world over, is
magnificent, and Longhurst
does justice to it. It would,
perhaps, have brought this
great achievement into more
marked relief had the early
mistakes been dealt with fully.
Explorers after oil, of the
pre-jeep and pre-airconditioned
days, may consider that the
hardships of desert and rain-
forest and muskeg have been
painted in too lurid colors,
for, to them, they were just
part of the job and were
accepted as such.
The author deals at length
with negotiations for oil-
concessions and, although he
adopts a neutral attitude to-
wards them, his account is a
sorry record of greed in the
Middle East and ingratitude
for the great benefits which
the inhabitants of that region
could not possibly have ob-
tained without Western techni-
cians and Western know-how.
For the general reader it can
be stated that the book is
written in completely non-
technical language and has a
human interest far beyond the
limits of the oil game. It repre-
sents, as Sir Winston Churchill
says in the foreword, “a story
of vigor and adventure in the
best traditions of the merchant-
venturers of Britain.”

Memoirs of a
Pioneer Pressman
(Abridged from a book to be published later)
By B. S. BAXTER COOK
(Founder of the Australian Journalists’ Association and No. 1 A.J.A. Gold Medallist)
APPREHENSIVE
ANDREW FISHER
Andrew Fisher, who was
Prime Minister in the
years 1908-09, 1910-13
and 1914-15, always
seemed to me to be in a state
of apprehension. This was
probably due to the fact that
the young Federal Labor party
was not then a very cohesive
body, composed as it was of
men from the six States
previously unacquainted per-
sonally.
Nothing annoyed Fisher
more than to learn that
Cabinet discussions often
became known in outside
circles, especially when the
proposals were in nothing more
than a nebulous form. Tradi-
tionally, the Prime Minister is
the spokesman for the Cabinet,
and these unauthorised dis-
closures developed in the up-
right Scotch P.M. a deep and
lasting suspicion of ulterior
motives. He was alert to any
possible indication of the
source of the Cabinet leakages.
There was the occasion when
I walked past the room of the
Prime Minister in the public
offices opposite Melbourne’s
Treasury Gardens. My shadow
had fallen across the imper-
vious glass panels. Within a
few seconds the door suddenly
opened and Fisher glared up
and down the corridor.
I asked Shepherd, secretary
to the P.M.’s Department, what
Fisher was looking for. He
replied that Fisher was
annoyed and irritable at the
leakage of Cabinet secrets.
There was a well-authen-
ticated story that Fisher at one
lime actually accused his col-
league, Hughes, of giving secret
Ministerial information to a
section of the press. I cannot
vouch personally for any such
accusation, but I had personal
experience of Fisher’s sus-
picious mind.
Pressmen can be lucky
sometimes in getting on the
track of a scoop. In the first
decade of Federation there had
been considerable discussion
of the question whether the
Post Office services, which had
automatically come under the
aegis of the Commonwealth,
should continue to be directly
controlled by a Minister of the
Crown, as was the Customs
Department, or be adminis-
tered by a Board of Commis-
sioners, as in the case of the
Victorian Railways.
One day, when the third
Fisher Administration was in
office, I was admiring a nice
new carpet which had been laid
in the vast Queen’s Hall in
Parliament House at the top
of Bourke Street, then the
temporary seat of the Federal
Government. My interest was
in the fact that the purchase
of this carpet had been the
subject of adverse criticism
because of the cost—a whole
£80! Those who know the
size of the Queen’s Hall will
today smile at this piece of
“extravagance.” However, near
the Queen’s statue I noticed
some torn scraps of letter-
paper.
Wondering why a man, when
he became a member of Par-
liament, should consider he
was privileged to scatter this
debris about a beautifully
appointed hall, I saw what
looked like a carefully folded
piece. Curiosity prompted me
to pick it up. It was a type-
written sheet, and appeared to
me to be a draft of a scheme
to place the postal, telegraphic
and telephonic services under
three commissioners.
In those days Parliamentary
pressmen had the privilege of
using the Speaker’s corridor at
the rear of the Chamber, to
interview Ministers on urgent
matters. 1 accordingly asked
the messenger on duty to
inform the then Postmaster-
General, Mr. W. G. Spence,
that I would like to see him.
Taking a bow at a venture,
I told Billy Spence that I had
a copy of the Cabinet’s scheme
to place the postal and tele-
graphic services under a board,
Andy Fisher (something
of what the writer saw in
him would appear to have
been later also noted by
David Low.)
and asked him if I could use
it, together with a few details
about the scheme.
With neither a yea or a nay,
he immediately put his hand
into his waistcoat pocket and
said, “Well, you have'n’t got
my copy, anyway.”
When I still pressed him for
details, he replied, “You had
better see Andy.”
The messenger took my
request to the Prime Minister.
It was some minutes before he
appeared. Then, standing on
the back step of the Chamber,
Fisher let go at me a broad-
side of his native Scotch, the
accent of which I will not
attempt to reproduce.
“Cook,” he said, in angry
tones, “I’m surprised at you.”
“Surprised at what?” I
asked.
“If you picked it up where
you said you did, somebody
must have put it there for
you.”
This astounded me, because
we had been on very friendly
terms. I had been to his home
not long before and had had
dinner with the family, so I at
once became very formal.
“Mr. Fisher,” I said, as
calmly as I could, “that is not
only a charge of breach of
faith on my part, but a serious
reflection on one of your
Cabinet colleagues.”
Still scowling, he imme-
diately turned his back on me
and returned to the Chamber.
T felt annoyed and humili-
ated. For a moment I was
inclined to use the scoop that
had accidentally come my
way. But I realised that Fisher
could not have been quite
himself. I knew that there had
been some dissensions in the
Cabinet. It had been whis-
pered that some members
wanted Fisher to resign and
accept the appointment of
Commonwealth High Commis-
sioner in London, Sir George
Reid’s term then being near
expiration. He was unable to
make up his mind. He

appeared to be worried over
a feeling that his proposed
appointment was more of a
move to enable Hughes to
become Prime Minister in his
place rather than a genuine
compliment to himself. If the
truth must be told, Fisher was
jealous of the brilliance of his
Attorney-General.
It was not much of a scoop,
anyway, and I decided to tele-
phone the then editor of the
“Herald,” Mr. J. E. Davidson,
and tell him what had taken
place, so as to protect myself
in case the story broke into
the news-columns of the other
dailies.
Davidson at once said,
“Don’t use it without Andy’s
consent. We must play the
game. It will pay dividends
in the long run.”
I was glad of this. I sent
in again for Fisher, and when
he came out into the corridor
he seemed in a better frame
of mind. I told him I was
not going to use the story, but
I asked him would he give me
first publication if the Cabinet
decided to accept the scheme?
He readily agreed, and our
cordial relations were resumed.
Labor members afterwards
told me that Fisher had
reported the incident to the
caucus and said that when the
time was ripe 1 was to have
the first press announcement.
It so happened that the pro-
posal was abandoned after a
. full discussion by the Labor
caucus. I told the story some
time afterwards to Archie
Whyte, who was then doing
the Federal rounds for his
paper in Sydney.
“Glory in heaven,” he
exclaimed, “and you call your-
self a pressman!”
“Well, what would you have
done?”
“Rushed the story on the
line to Sydney,” he said, “and
asked questions afterwards.”
I did not argue this ques-

who was always very impul-

friend the credit of not really

fact remains, however, that
Labor members’ attitude
towards me seemed to prove
Davidson’s remark that play-
ing the game by political
reporters “always pays divi-
dends.”
A lthough politically sus-
picious, Fisher was him-
self entirely free of guile. He
had the utmost trust in his
staff, and often signed letters
and documents prepared by
official secretary Malcolm


Shepherd without troubling to
read them.
Fisher was not a fluent
speaker. But he was forthright
and decisive. He never left
anybody in doubt. Unfortu-
nately he fell into a habit of
putting off doing things until
the last moment. Shepherd
always went to a lot of trouble
in the preparation of material
for speeches appropriate to the
many occasions when the
Prime Minister would be the
guest-speaker. But Fisher
never seemed to find time to
absorb it. The result was
usually poor speeches.
[Andrew Fisher ultimately
accepted the position of High Com-
missioner in London and Hughes
became Prime Minister.
The question of discontinuing
the Postal Department as a section
of the Commonwealth Public Ser-
vice and placing it under a busi-
ness commission similar to the
board of management of Trans-
Australia Airlines has been re-
vived several times since. The
most recent announcement (1957)
was that the Postmaster-General,
Mr. Davidson, in the Menzies Gov-
ernment, was examining alterna-
tive methods of Post Office control.
This immediately brought forward
a threat from the Administrative
and Clerical Association that any
interference with the present
administrative system “will be
strongly opposed.”!
"BILLY THE GREAT"
The Federal Parliament
may wait many years
before another “Billy”
Hughes makes his
appearance within its exclusive
portals. William Morris
Hughes will go down in history
as one of the most nimble-
minded figures, as well as being
a great statesman. Much to
his amusement his admirers
conferred on him the title
“Billy the Great.”
Billy was born in Wales in
1864. He was educated at the
Llandudno Grammar School,
and later at St. Stevens
Grammar School, Westminster,
where he became a student-
teacher. This was the educa-
tional background of the little
pint-size architect of his own
fortunes, who came to Aus-
tralia in 1884 and in turn be-
came navvy, boundary-rider,
deckhand, bookseller, dock-
worker and travelling umbrella-
mender.
Hughes soon got interested
in Labor politics, and in 1890
he organised the Waterside
Workers’ Union, of which he
became secretary. Four years
later he began his Parlia-
mentary career as member for
Lang in the N.S.W. Legislative
Assembly, and in 1901 he was
returned to the Federal House
of Representatives as member
for West Sydney.
Such is the brief record of
the man who later became a
world figure during the period
of the first World War, and
made Australia’s name famous
through the British Empire as
that of a Dominion to be
reckoned with. Even Presi-
dent Woodrow Wilson of the
United States came to respect
his force of character and
appreciate his clear line of
thought.
Hughes was very deaf. When
the House of Representatives
met each day, Billy could be
seen busily assembling his
hearing-aid. When it was
obvious that a member wanted
to interject something to him
in the course of a speech Billy
would obligingly turn the little
receiver in his direction—that
is, if Billy was satisfied that
it would not be likely to be
an unfriendly interjection. If
it were from a political
opponent Billy would quietly
ignore the interjector as if he
had not heard him.
Sometimes the hearing-aid
would play tricks. On one
occasion, when Billy had
entered the House after pro-
ceedings had started, and, as
usual when not in office, was
sitting on one of the back
benches, he seemed to be
having some trouble in getting
the instrument to function
properly. While he was thus
engaged a loud buzzing dis-
turbed the House.
The Speaker looked at Billy
and called “Order!” But Billy
was not looking at the Speaker
and did not heed the call. The
hearing-aid took no notice of
it, either; but the instrument
could hardly be “named” (i.e.,
called by his own name and
not referred to as “Honorable
member”), thus being made
liable for all the pains and
penalties that could be inflicted
on a member for unruly
conduct.
In this contretemps a member
went over to Billy and, touch-
ing him on the arm, pointed
to the disorderly instrument.
Probably for the first time in
his public career Billy sud-
denly looked self-conscious.
He immediately realised what
was happening, and turned-off
the battery. Then, to the
amusement of the House, he
bowed his apologies to “Mr.
Speaker,” with a gesture that
plainly said he would sharply
discipline the instrument for its
unparliamentary behavior.
TJTughes was one of the best
speakers in the House. He
was not a fluent orator in the
sense that his elegant sentences
would flow smoothly in a
golden stream. His utterances
were jerky, and his pauses were
often embarrassing to listeners.
They felt inclined to help him
with what seemed like the miss-
ing word. But he needed no
such help. His pauses were
due to his quiet searching of
his mind for the right way
to say the right thing. When
he had it fixed, it was usually
so polished and fitting an ex-
pression that his audience
somehow seemed rewarded for
their patience.
An instance of Hughes’s
ready wit came in a tense
House during a bitter political
debate on the occasion when
the Deakin-Cook coalition had
been formed to oust the first
Fisher Administration. Hughes
had scarified Deakin in a
masterly speech full of cutting
sarcasm and biting ridicule.
Hughes knew his Bible as
few other public men did ; and
in Matthew xxvi, Verse 34,
there is this passage: “Jesus
said unto him [Peter]: Verily
I say unto thee that this night,
before the cock-crow, thou
shalt deny me thrice.”
Hughes had charged Deakin
with a breach of faith. Deakin
shouted a denial. Hughes
repeated the accusation.
Deakin denied it a second time.
Hughes paused dramatically,
and characteristically cupped
his hand against his ear, as if
he was waiting for some
distant sound.
Gently prompted by the
Speaker to proceed, Hughes
said, “I was waiting for the
cock to crow.”
This incident, irrupting into
a tense verbal atmosphere,
released a gale of laughter
from all sides of the House,
which seemed to relieve the
pent-up feelings of members.
Then there was the occasion
when, as a journalist, I had
got wind of a top Government
secret. Billy warned me that
it was not to be published or
even referred to in any indirect
way. To make doubly sure,
he wrote me, as a reminder, a
private note in his own hand-
writing:—
My dear Cook,
The Censor may his shadow
never grow less has heen in-
structed to club all reports, save
those hearing th« trade mark .
Issued by authority
Field Marshal.—W.M.H.
Billy Hughes, as a 6st.
dyspeptic field-marshal, no
doubt struck him as a good
joke against himself. It was
typical of him when he was
in one of his more affable
moods.
'T'here are scores of other
stories about Billy Hughes,
but the authenticity of many
is doubtful. For instance, my
old fellow-journalist Arthur
Watkin Wynne told me this
one, but was careful to say
that he could not vouch for it.
However, it seemed to be
typical.
Billy was asked to read the
Lesson in a Parramatta
(N.S.W.) church during the
period when he was Prime
Minister in World War I.
Thumbing the Bible he said,
“And the Lord said to
Moses .” He paused a frac-
tion of a second to remark,
“And quite rightly, too! ”
before going on with his read-
ing of what the Lord said to
Moses.
Wynne told me another
story, which I think was true
because it rang a bell in my

memory. A friend had an
appointment with Hughes
while the House of Represen-
tatives was sitting. While
waiting outside the Chamber
for him, he saw through the
glass doors that Billy seemed
to be listening closely to what
Rowley James —a popular,
though garrulous, N.S.W.
member—was saying. Such a
speech is often welcomed by
members because it gives them
the opportunity to go out and
have a smoke. It was nearly
half-an-hour later that Billy
emerged to keep the appoint-
ment.
“You seemed very interested
in what Rowley was saying,”
remarked his friend. “What
was he talking about?”
Billy replied, “He didn’t
say! ”
This is another “Billy”
incident of Arthur Wynne’s,
which I feel I can vouch for,
because Arthur told it against
himself.
When Arthur was on the
staff of the Sydney “Sun” he
nearly succeeded in getting for
his paper the story of Billy’s
life. Billy finally turned down
the proposition, despite a very
attractive offer, but he pro-
mised that if he changed his
mind he would let Arthur have
the story. Many years later
Arthur and Billy were at Sir
Keith Murdoch’s luncheon-
table at the Melbourne
“H era 1 d” office. Arthur
reminded Billy of the old
promise.
“Good Lord,” said Billy,
“how r the blazes can I write
the story of my life? I’ve got
two Ministers away, and
enough in my own job to keep
me more than busy.”
Wynne suggested that it
might be possible to supply
him with a competent journa-
list to “ghost” the story for
him. Billy’s eyes gleamed.
He was in a mischievous mood.
“Oh, you would give me a
competent journalist, would
you? Who might that be?”
Arthur remarked, just for
fun, “Why, I might even do
it myself!”
Billy’s reply was immediate
and conclusive.
“Yes,” he said, “that’s what
I was bloody well afraid of!”
TTughes had the unique gift
of sharply applying a
cliche in such appropriate
circumstances as to give it new
life. There was the time when
a prosy and ponderous mem-
ber had made a carefully
considered number of allega-
tions. Hughes at once, and in
some heat, designated the
utterance as “a tissue of flag-
rant lies.” Promptly called to
order by the Speaker, Hughes
begged leave to substitute
“a series of terminological
inexactitudes” a somewhat
hackneyed phrase, but its
delivery against a very learned
member who always dotted his
“l’s” and crossed his “T’s”
tickled the House.
I don’t think anybody in
the Federal Parliament took
as much trouble over his
speeches as Billy. He care-
fully assembled all available
matter relevant to the subject,
and mentally digested it. In
the process he arranged in his
mind the sequence of his
telling points, and led-up to
them in the clearest diction.
But he was never quite satis-
fied afterwards with his effort.
It is the practice in Parlia-
mentary proceedings for copies
of members’ speeches to be
sent to them as soon as printed
and before being bound. I
have seen some of the galley-
proofs of Hughes’s speeches
with his alterations written
along, and almost completely
filling, the margins.
It was not that he had been
misreported. No member gave
the “Hansard” reporters less
trouble than Hughes. He
always spoke slowly and very
distinctly. What Hughes often
did with his galley-proofs was
to reconstruct some of his
sentences or use a more appro-
priate word here and there.
He certainly made his speeches
read a little more smoothly,
but for a busy man like a
Prime Minister to spend so
much time to further polish
“Hansard” reports of really
good deliveries seemed to me
very much like a work of
supererogation.
It is not to be inferred that
members have the right to alter
“Hansard” reports in any way
they please. “Hansard” isi
controlled by the President of
the Senate and by the Speaker
of the House of Representa-
tives. When the proofs are
returned by members to the
chief “Hansard” reporter with
alterations or omissions which
might be questionable it is his
duty to refer them for decision
to the President or the Speaker.
Many members should be,
and indeed are, grateful to the
“Hansard” reporters for lick-
ing their speeches into shape.
Few of them take the trouble
that Billy always did, of pro-
perly preparing their contribu-
tions to the debate. I have
often seen “Hansard” men, on
entering to take their report-
ing turn, when a poor kind
of speaker happened to be
addressing the House, sit
inactive with notebook open
and pen poised, waiting for the
member on his feet to say
something they felt was worth
recording. This was a great
liberty and a great respon-
sibility for them to take, but
when the report appeared in
“Hansard” it would look like
a very good speech, and the
member concerned was natur-
ally very pleased.
Incidentally, there was a

Little Capitalists and Capital-gains
Two Voices from the Past
When Senator Ormonde recently
attacked the suggestion that
wage-earners should be en-
couraged and assisted to buy
shares in public companies he argued
that such a scheme would lead to “tame-
cat” trade-unionism. It would mean, he
said, that trade-unions in Australia
would become as powerless as in Russia
as far as wages and conditions were
concerned.
Apparently it didn't occur to any of his
audience—he was addressing an A.L.P.
meeting at Moss Vale, N.S.W. —that in
Russia wages and conditions were fixed
by the State, which is also the sole
employer, whereas in this country they
are determined by independent courts.
This, however, is a relatively minor
point when the whole of Ormonde’s
statement provides a perfect example
of the type of out-of-date thinking
which fogs the minds of the senior ranks
of Labor Parliamentarians and makes
them the real conservatives of Austra-
lian politics. There is no place in Aus-
tralia today for the doctrine of class-war
or the belief that the interests of em-
ployers and employees are diametrically
opposed.
Ormonde’s outburst was occasioned by
an address given to members of the
Sydney Stock Exchange by G. Keith
Funston, president of the New York
Stock Exchange, in which he told of the
growth in America of what he called
“people’s capitalism”—the mass-owner-
ship of shares by wage-earners.
Funston said that seven or eight years
ago it became apparent in the United
States that “the kind of industrial growth
that was necessary to catch up with the
accumulated demands of the war years—
and to move ahead —required billions
of dollars of new money each year.
Those billions, we realised, were beyond
the combined capabilities of the wealthy
few or our financial institutions. We
needed, in other words, a new source
of supply—and that source was a great
mass of the American people.”
Monthly Investment Plan
"Cunston related how he and his col-
A leagues had set-out to inform the
American public about the workings of
the Stock Exchange and the sharemarket
and of the investment opportunities that
were available even to people of modest
incomes. A Monthly Investment Plan
was devised to provide means whereby
‘a man of average income can invest
in the stock oT his choice, out of in-
come, for as little as 45 cents a day.”
The number of persons regularly using
the plan exceeds 100,000 and is still
growing. Investment-clubs are also en-
couraged. These consist of groups of
10 to 15 people who pool small sums to
buy securities.
A further feature of the move to
spread ownership is the employee-stock
plan which enables employees to acquire
shares in the concerns for which they
work. According to Funston, more
than 1.3-million people in the United
States are now investing regularly
through employee-stock plans. It is
probably this particular phase of
“people’s capitalism” that has raised the
ire of Senator Ormonde and which he
has in mind when he speaks of “in-
dustrial sedation,” especially as he sees
company superannuation - schemes as
“another threat” to the trade-unions.
He warns that worker-shareholders
would only get “peanuts” from their
investment and would have no control
over the company.
The size and quantity of the peanuts
are, of course, in direct proportion to
the amount invested, so if the Senator
is going to condemn the scheme on that
score he should, with equal justification,
advise trade-unionists not to put their
money in savings-banks, because of the
low return. As to control of the com-
panies, this again is in proportion to
the amount invested and it is hard to
see how it could be otherwise. True,
the individual shareholder’s power to
influence the company is negligible, but
so is the individual elector’s power to
influence a Government, yet neither
Senator Ormonde nor the Labor party
would consider that a sufficient reason
for condemning democracy, or for
advocating non-co-operation.
Changed Conditions
Tl7hen Senator Ormonde expresses
- alarm at the possibility of Austra-
lian wage-earners being induced to invest
in shares in public companies he is
refusing to recognise the great change
in the condition of the general wage-
earner that is implied in the Funston
plan. In the 1890’s, when Senator
Ormonde’s party was in its infancy, it
would have been ludicrous to suggest
that industry could hope to draw some
of its needed developmental capital
from the workers. Today, after 14 years
of full-employment and with real wages,
particularly for young unmarried
workers, at their highest peak, there is
nothing ludicrous about it. In fact, its
obvious possibility has Ormonde and
those who think like him worried. In-
stead of accepting it as proof of the
improved status of the wage-earner and
claiming for their party some credit for
helping to bring it about, the Ormondes
talk of the “threat to the unions.”
Trade-unionists and their wages and
conditions are not threatened at all by
this development. On the contrary,
industry will have a very good reason
for maintaining a high-wage economy.
The only trade-unionists threatened are
those professional trade-union officials
who feel they have a vested interest in
class-war and industrial discontent.
Stemming from similar outmoded
thinking is the recent plea of Arthur
Calwell, Labor’s Federal deputy-leader,
for a capital-gains tax as a means by
which “those who are getting the rake-
off couid be made to disgorge much of
their ill-gotten gain.”
This sort of talk used to be standard
Socialist jargon. “Rake-off,” “disgorge”
and “ill-gotten” are all loaded words,
calculated to win shouts of approval
from Sunday-afternoon crowds on the
Yarra bank or in Sydney Domain.
It is very easy to talk of the capitalist
raking-off unearned increment; to pic-
ture him as bloated with undeserved
profits, filched from the unfortunate
worker, and which he must be forced
to disgorge. But describing capital-gains
as ill-gotten doesn’t make them ill-gotten
or constitute a valid ground for seizing
them. In many cases the so-called
capital-gains represent a revaluation of
assets to bring them closer to the realities
of a depreciated currency, and they cer-
tainly don’t merit the administering of a
tax-emetic to force disgorgement.
A Social Sinner?
TAoes Calwell want a capital-gains tax
on land? Assuming he is among
the 69 per cent, of Australian house-
holders who own (or are buying) their
own homes, does he consider himself
a social \ sinner because the Valuer-
General now rates his house at two or
three times its prewar value? Calwell
is now in his twentieth year in the
Federal Parliament. At a conservative
estimate the capital-value of a Federal
seat is about three times what it was
in 1940. Does this cause Arthur to lie
awake at night wrestling with his social
conscience?
Tax capital-gains and you will, in all
fairness, have to rebate capital-losses.
Such a proposal may seem to have little
terrors for Calwell and co. on the basis
of the last few years; but supposing
the principle had been in force in 1930 —
what would it have cost to subsidise the
capital-losses of the depression years?
The idea that Funston and others have
been able to foster in America is that
the prosperity of the workers is bound
up with the prosperity of the businesses
that employ them and industry in
general. In a period of expansion such
as the present new capital is needed and
if some of it can come from the wage-
earners, they will be the gainers later.
The real objection of the Ormondes
and Calwells is not to “workers’
capitalism” but to capitalism itself. The
Socialists see their dream fading and
they don’t like it. Let them do some
rethinking. If their basic desire is the
welfare of the worker is it necessary
to assume that this can be achieved only
through Socialism? The capitalism of
today is vastly different from the
capitalism of 1890. It has adapted itself
to changing conditions. Too many of
its critics seem unable to do the same.

Last of the Cups
Macdougal was an absentee
from last Saturday’s Williams-
town Cup field, but second,
third, fourth and fifth runners
in the Melbourne Cup had
another outing in the
mile-and-a-half Williamstown
(worth £4OOO, plus a gold cup
valued at £300).
• • • •
Royal Jester (18th at
Flemington) landed the big end
of the stake, with Saranover
and Dawdie, neither of whom
started in the Melbourne Cup,
taking the places. The winner
had luck on his side
undoubtedly the little Wes-
tralian mare Dawdie would
have won the Cup had her
saddle not slipped at the half-
mile. Still, the five-year-old
Timanova gelding deserved a
change of fortune. His record
is studded with minor placings
in big races, most recently his
second in the Metropolitan;
and it added a lot to the merit
of his win that he started from
the outside of the 16 runners.
In recent races Royal Jester
had been ridden by Noel Mc-
Growdie, but on Saturday
former Victorian Mervyn
Moore, who had been riding
well in New Zealand, had the
mount. He did an excellent
job.
Royal Jester is New Zealand-
bred, by Timanova from
Tendril. His owners, E. F.
Allison and Mrs. Allison,
recently shifted from the
Dominion to Sydney. They
secured a bargain when they
bought Royal Jester for
375gns.
Favorites have had a lean
time in Melbourne’s sundry
Cup races this spring. Regal
Wench was a 20-to-l chance
in the Caulfield Cup, Sanvo
was* at 15 to 1 in the Moonee
Valley Cup, Macdougal at 8
to 1 for the Melbourne Cup,
and on Saturday Royal Jester
went out at 16 to 1.
With the Oaks placegetters
■ —all of whom were inter-State
entries—not in the race, Vic-
torian fillies had their chance
for a rich prize in the set-
weight mile Sandown Guineas
at Caulfield. Appropriately,
Twilight Glow, a close-up
fourth in the Oaks, took the
1300gns. for first. This was
only the third running of the
Sandown, and Twilight Glow’s
time of 1.37 1/10 was better
than the previous winners,
Orient and But Beautiful, had
recorded. Twilight Glow is
another trained at Pakenham
by Ray Webster, who came so
close to the rich prizes of the
spring with Nether Gold,
runner-up in both the Moonee
“ Collaborator !"
Valley Cup and Melbourne
Cup.
It is a bit early to be think-
ing of next winter’s Nationals,
but it might be worth remem-
bering the performance of
Sol beam in the Highway
Hurdle. Having only his
second start over the jumps,
Solbeam ran a new record for
Caulfield jumping-races, cover-
ing the two miles in 3.33 7/10.
A five-year-old, Solbeam is
beautifully bred, being by
Helios from Moonbeam by
Midstream. Moonbeam won
the Maribyrnong Plate in
1946. Solbeam is not one of
those horses put to jumping
after proving a failure on the
flat— at his most recent flat-
start he won a Welter at Kil-
more. Another unusual fea-
ture about him is that he is an
entire, and very few entires
ever race over obstacles. He
will win Hurdles with a lot
more than the 9.11 he carried
on Saturday.
Melbourne’s two-year-olds
did not look up to the best
of the inter-State youngsters
during the racing at Fleming-
ton, but if Melbourne can
claim The Penciller it has a
two-year-old who may prove
one of the smartest in the
land. The gelding is trained in
Melbourne by Basil Conaghan,
but is owned by a group of
Sydney racing-people—Mrs. J.
Crawford (wife of the former
tennis-star), the father-and-son
combination of D. and D.
Chrystal, and G. E. Ryder and
A. Dowling. The Penciller,
who started a warm favorite
and kept all the pencillers on
the course very busy, is by
Newtown Wonder from Fairy-
stream. He has started four
times and won at his last three
runs, with Saturday’s win his
most impressive so far. He
sped over the five furlongs in
58 9/10, and could have done
better with opposition.
• • • •
It has been a long time
between wins for the four-
year-old Dhoti gelding Sianna,
who took the first heat of the
Heatherton Welter. The geld-
ing, raced by well-known
Dandenong cafe proprietor S.
De George, last won in the
metropolitan area in 1957.
He has not been able to
manage a place even in the
country at his last half-dozen
starts, but on Saturday, well
ridden by Jack Purtell, he
showed something of the form
that won him three city races
as a two-year-old.
Times were fast all day at
Caulfield, but the big chestnut
Landau colt Anonyme put up
an exceptional performance
to cover the six furlongs of
the Strand Handicap in 1.9 j.
It is a new track-record; and
it’s rare indeed for a horse
to break 1.10 anywhere in
Australia. And the three-year-
old carried 9.4. As was men-
tioned here after his last win,
the attempt to make Anonyme
into a middle-distance per-
former was a failure, but as
a sprinter he is in top-class.
He gets his dash from his dam,
La Patrice, who could go like
the wind. The colt has now
won five races, four of them
at Caulfield.
• • • •
Society Beau, another who
does best at Caulfield, also
recorded his fourth success at
that track when he easily won
the second heat of the Heather-
ton Welter. A four-year-old
horse by Masthead from
Society Belle, he’s raced by
Mrs. J. Pirani, who also raced
his dam. He is not quite up
to the best spring company,
but over the summer months
will probably improve on his
already useful record.
Melbourne racing is again
at Caulfield next Saturday,
with the main event the £3OOO
Eclipse Stakes. Originally,
when the race was inaugurated
in 1924, it was known as the
Consolation Stakes, and it is
regarded as a sop to those
horses that have not won a
big race during the Spring
Carnival. The make-up of the
field is very much in doubt at
time of writing, but it is the
type of race to suit Dawdie,
with Smokey Jane, Inner Spring
and Declaree likely to run
well.

most interesting runners at the
Warwick Farm meeting, and
the most costly as a yearling
(4000gns.), cleared out with the
Hoxton Park Stakes for two-
year-old colts and geldings.
Harry Tancred, former chair-
man and now a committeeman
of the Sydney Turf Club, races
the Star Kingdom (imp.)
youngster in partnership with
his daughter, Miss Mary
Tancred. Trained by M.
McCarten, the colt was thought
good enough to win at first
race-start the A.J.C. Breeders’
Plate, but Sky High proved
too smart for him. He was,
however, vastly superior to his
Warwick Farm opponents, win-
ning by eight lengths from
Regained, who had scored in
runaway style at Rosehill a
fortnight previously. Valiant
Queen, dam of Gemini Prince,
is by Gold Nib (imp.) from
Egyptian Rose by Iliad (imp.)
from Lotus Lily by Chief
Ruler (imp.). She is a sister
to Aboukir.
Martian King, winner of the
Warwick Second Maiden, is
trained by Rosebery mentor
George McCahon and raced
by Mrs. McCahon. A product
of Empyrean (imp.) from Miss
Blue Stocking (imp.), the geld-
ing was well ridden by Neil
Watterson, his first city win
for about two years, though
he has meantime done well in
the country. Tezpur, also
trained at Rosebery, ran a
sound race and may soon win.
Scratchings reduced the Mil-
perra Handicap field to four,
and they made it a spacious
procession to the line, Bold
Pilot boldly piloting Just King-
dom by eight lengths, with
Aluinn five lengths further
back, and then a long gap to
old Beaupa, gaining a hard-
earned £25 for his fourth. It
was an eighth win for Bold
Pilot, whose list includes a
Rosehill Guineas and w.-f.-a.
Rawson Stakes. Stable appren-
tice H. Williams, who had the
winning ride, looks a very
promising lad, worth keeping
an eye on later in the season.
Grenoble has won the best
part of a dozen races, at from
six to 11 furlongs, but he keeps
on being disbelieved by
punters. A.J.C. Doncaster
winner last year, he was a
good second to Yarrawin over
10 furlongs at Rosehill three
starts back. Switched then to
seven furlongs he proved his
versatility by scoring in good
style over Squander Lad and
Merry Amber, also at Rosehill.
Last Saturday it was a six-
furlongs sprint at the Farm—
and four of the nine runners
were preferred to him in the
betting! Grenoble had a lot
of weight, but he treated both
it and the boggy going with
ignore, romping home from
favorite Squander Lad and
pacemaker Front Cover. Even
so, it took him 1.15 f to go
round—about five seconds out-
side the track record.
In the other Warwick Farm
mud events consistent three-
year-old Bold Lass recorded her
second win in four starts by
easily defeating Hasty Belle
and Glamour Belle in the
Novice for fillies and mares ;
and Johnno—who can now be
rated a genuine mudlark,
having won on slow tracks
at each of his last three starts
—landed the mile Leumeah
Handicap. Three - year - old
Peel Street’s good third to
Martian King and King’s
Standard suggested that he was
well worth noting down as an
early likely winner in similar
company.

Not the first time it has
happened, the Canterbury Park
track got so sloppy at the mid-
week meeting that the final
event on the card had to be
abandoned. On that sort of
track anything can happen, and
winners included one or two
that hadn’t shown much in the
way of form at recent starts.
Among them, outsider Par-
dorus came from the rear of
the field in the Wednesday
Handicap to run down Cragia,
who looked all set for his first
Sydney win (he had won nine
times in N.S.W. northern and
north-western areas up to the
end of last year). In the High-
weight Plymouth caught
Boyalla in the final stages, but
Plymouth was solidly backed
from 5 to 2 down to 7 to 4. At
his prior start, on October 14,
he was a 66-to-l shot at the
same track and finished in the
ruck. He had lately been going
well in training, and it wasn’t
much of a field.

The familiar Osborne livery
(all red), carried with success
in past years, was seen once
again in a winning role when
four-year-old Beau Geste
landed the Canterbury
longs Maiden. Raced by
P. J. 8., M. R. and H. P. G.
Osborne and trained by Frank
Dalton, he’s a Beau Son-Delos
gelding, the dam an unraced
mare by Hua from Helleniqua
(Fr.) by Agathos. Helleniqua
won the Cambridgeshire in
England and 15 races in
France.

Fickle Maid has now won
five Sydney races, four of them
at Canterbury Park, she having
added the Second Lakemba
Handicap to her list at the
same midweek meeting. She
should be able to gallop—her
dam, Golden Chariot, was
brilliant on Sydney and Mel-
bourne courses, best wins
being Caulfield’s One Thousand
Guineas, the A.J.C. Easter
Handicap and Rosehili’s
Cinderella Handicap (by six
lengths in race-record time).

Sydney wasn’t the only place
that copped it wet on Satur-
day ; in Brisbane the Queens-
land Derby had to be post-
poned. It should add another
to Travel Boy’s nice lot of
wins.

Roy James, who was riding
winners before many of today’s
jockeys were bom, and who
still keeps himself fit by riding
many horses in track-trials at
Rosebery (he’s one of the first,
if not the first, to arrive at that
course in the early morning),
was given a grand reception
when he won last Saturday’s
Newcastle Tattersall’s Cup on
Daresay. Trained at Rand-
wick by Terry Brosnan, Dare-
say beat a smart field of
sprinters.

“P.0.M.C.”: Touching on
the mention here (B. 11/11/ ’59)
that crowds actually exceeding
200,000 attended the recent
V.R.C. carnival, perhaps Rand-
wick programmes carefully
framed to attract the best
horses available all the year
round would go a long way
towards attracting bigger
crowds. This is, and always
has been, the V.R.C.’s policy
at Flemington.

Other Sports
First of the big golf, the
Ampol Tourney was tightly
fought to the closest possible
of finishes, through tough
weather-conditions most of the
way on Sydney’s Kensington.
South African Gary Player
deserved to bring it olf,
bridging a three-stroke lead —
and then lipping a putt! —to
make a tie of it with Kel Nagle.
It was a blanket-finish
altogether, Peter Thomson only
a stroke away in third place
and Jim Mclnnes only another
stroke off for his fourth. The
Ampol handout was £3OO0 —
£6OO each for the dead-heaters,
£250 for Thomson, £125 for
Mclnnes. And now it’s Mel-
bourne for the Canada Cup,
with the pair-reps, of 30
countries having a crack at it,
and if they better the show-
ings in the Ampol they’ll pro-
vide about the richest spread of
golf ever seen hereabouts.

Winning in four sets, 6-1,
6-2, 1-6, 6-3, Roy Emerson
repeated his 1957 title win
against Neale Fraser in the
Queensland championships.
Fraser couldn’t withstand the
brilliant serving and backhand
shots of his Australian team-
mate and doubles-partner.

watched young Jan Lehane defeat-
ing 6ft. English star Christine
Truman in the final of the women’s

land. Christine, rated second-best
girl in the world, got three games

(N.S.W.), is apparently tireless.
But she’s human. All last year
Edwards had her practising hard
to eliminate her two-handed shot
on the left wing. It was a shot
exploitable by a determined player,
as Jan herself appreciated. So
she toiled to develop strength on
her backhand, and Edwards was
confident that she would forget the
two-hander this season. Instead,
being human, Jan reverted to her
natural stroke. Even so, she’s
easily the best girl player in Aus-
tralia and the only worth-while
opponent for Wimbledon and U.S.
champion Marie Bueno.
“Linesman”: “Rocket”
Laver looks certain to be the
world’s greatest tennis-player
inside two years. He has the
potential in strokes and tempera-
ment, and he made wonderful
improvement on his recent trip
abroad and through the guidance
of “Master” Harry Hopman.
Playing in a Sydney tournament he
produced the reason why he
mastered some of the world’s best
players. It was through his back-
hand —a magnificent stroke. Laver
can play this stroke with astonish-
ing ease. His touch is such that
he can step in and hit the ball
with severe overspin, just as Lew
Hoad does. But he’s better than
Hoad on the low underspin shot,
which he doesn’t rush, but places
carefully. Laver contrives to con-
trol the ball so that he can force
an upward stroke by his opponent,
or gain the net-position through
his fast reflexes and footwork.
Fast serves by an opponent don’t
worry him. The ginger-haired kid
from Queensland (incidentally, he
was 21 in August, not 22, as Sydney
papers said) can “block” and
“steer” a ball with the same
efficiency as he can hit an open-
faced return. Added to those quali-
ties, Laver has a sound forehand,
a formidable fast and kicking
service, and plenty of “nerve.”

lan Craig has been selected
to lead the N.S.W. Shield team
against Queensland in Brisbane
on Friday. On the Saturday before
his selection, batting late in the day,
he made only 7, but —showing his
eye to be in, as he demonstrated
with some good knocks with
Compton’s XI in South Africa-
six of them came with one big hit
off pace-bowler Cotton, a former
State bowler. Veteran “caretaker”
captain of previous years, Sid
Carroll, though jn good form in
grade-cricket this year, has been
passed over.
The team, which seems a strong
one, carries several all-rounders—
John Martin, who played for South
Australia last season without doing
a great deal, after having played
for N.S.W. before that; fast-
bowler Frank Misson, who
impressed against W.A. in his one
Shield game last season; and John
O’Reilly, who’s been in and out
of the State side in recent years.
Two new bowlers are young
Wollongong speedster Barry Bates
and Western Suburbs left-armer
Wally Wellham, originally from
Newcastle way, who in recent years
has formed, with Alan Davidson
and Alan Wyatt, a three-pronged
West attack Which was usually
enough to dispose of all opposi-
tion without further assistance.
“Zorok”: I don’t think Ray
McNamee (B. 11/11/ ’59)
played cricket for N.S.W. on
into his forties. He was only
in his forties when he died, and
he had not played first-class
cricket for many years before
that (in the war years or soon
afterwards). Still, he was
Randwick club’s opening and
main wicket-taking bowler for
a long while after dropping
out of first-class cricket. His
figures were 0-124 in Victoria’s
record first-class score of 1107
made in 1926, when Arthur
Mailey’s figures were 4-362.
A nephew of McNamee’s, Tom
Callaghan, a fast-bowler for
Mosman, was spoken of as a
likely State or Test bowler;
but he’s been overshadowed of
late by other fasties, in par-
ticular his club-mate Gordon
Rorke.

Figures are not complete, but
last year the N.S.W. Rugby
League gave almost £50,000

effort that might take a bit of
beating.

“Bondi”: A year ago 8840
saw Sydney’s Soccer grand-final
in perfect weather; this year
over 12,000 were there to watch
the grand-final in weather that
might have kept ducks under
cover. During the season a
Federation side that defeated
Costa Rica showed world
class, and no fewer than
20,000 played in Junior
Soccer’s weekend matches.
Soccer’s progress has, in fact,
been one of the year’s most
remarkable features of Sydney
sport.
“Athlete”: Though our men
and women track-officials
usually co-operate closely in
administration, and especially
nearing selection of teams for
Empire or Olympic Games, the
two bodies are in strong opposi-
tion this year on the question
of standards for the Olympic
teams. The women have set
very high standards ; the men
won’t ask any athlete to
undergo such a test. The
women say standards ensure a
top-class team ; the men say
standards aren’t necessary.
Seems like a case of “stacking”
the Olympic team with second-
raters, as there are fewer than
half-a-dozen men in Australia
in medal-winning Olympic
class. Despite statements to
the contrary, that’s the only
ambition of teams nowadays.

A contributed boner in these
pages (B. 4/11/ ’59) wrongly
stated that Jim Stuart of
“Shore,” who won several
events at the recent Sydney
G.P.S. athletics, is a son of
Charlie Stuart, also of “Shore”
—and long ago. He is a son
of Jim Stuart, of Sydney Road,

“Smash Hit”: Eight years
ago a three-man committee
was appointed by the major
sporting bodies of Australia
to investigate methods of rais-
ing funds to finance Australian
teams for Olympic and Empire
Games. Critics had condemned
the system under which the
responsible body waited till the
teams were known before
making an all-out public
appeal. Eventually, after
hundreds of people had been
interviewed, the committee
recommended continuation of
the existing method. It found
that public interest was stimu-
lated when the names of the
team were known ; and, despite
the critics, the method has been
a great success. Anyway, since
international Games were
revived after the war some
£500,000 has been raised —and
not one athlete has been left
behind.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
THE BORDER DISPUTES
CJummarising the course of
the border-disputes between
India and China prior to last
week’s “withdrawal” proposals
by Chinese Premier Chou
En-lai and India’s cautious
reaction to them, London
“Economist” notes that only
lately, from information pub-
lished by Indian Prime Minister
Nehru, has it emerged that the
disputes “began almost as soon
as India thought it had regu-
lated them by its 1954 agree-
ment with Peking.
“In 1955 and 1956 Chinese
troops crossed at Bara Hoti,
at Shipki Pass, which leads to
Simla and other points.
“In 1957 they built a military
road, linking Gartok with
Yarkand, through the Aksai
Chin area in north-east Kash-
mir. This is an uninhabited
area, 17,000 ft. high, and not
easily reached from the Indian
side. An Indian party sent to
investigate in 1958 was taken
prisoner by the Chinese, who
met Delhi’s complaints by say-
ing that the area was theirs.
“This year the Chinese have
grown more aggressive along
the border. To subdue the still-
restive Tibetans, they have had
to bring in more troops and
seal the border more tightly.
Indian sympathy for Tibet, and
the giving of asylum to the
Dalai Lama and 13,000
Tibetan refugees, have aroused
Chinese resentment.
“In July six Indian police
men were taken prisoner in
Ladakh. On August 7, 200
Chinese soldiers forced a police-
post back two miles from the
border 'of the North-east
Frontier Agency, near the
Bhutan end.
“On August 25 another
Chinese force attacked a post
north of Longju and took 11
prisoners ; next day it attacked
the little Longju garrison and
forced it to withdraw, leaving
three dead.
“Late last month, in the
worst incident yet, an Indian
patrol 40 miles west of Lanak
Pass was attacked, losing 17
men. Chinese soldiers simul-
taneously approached India’s
main airstrip in this area, at
Chushul, east of Leh.
“The Chinese retort to all
Indian complaints was that the
areas concerned were Chinese,
and that the Indians must not
trespass. But until 1958
Indian inquiries about maps
that showed these areas (totall-
ing 40,000 sq.-miles) as Chinese
had met with polite evasiveness
in Peking, which repeatedly
said that the maps were old
ones and had not yet been
revised.”
After a similar summary in
London “Time and Tide,” E.
Heskell Smith commented:
“His [Nehru’s] promise to
fight if India’s border States are
attacked is at variance with his
behavior when India proper is
invaded. The result can be
seen in the attitude of the
Government of Nepal, which
is adopting an apparently
neutralist policy in the dispute
between India and China. Mao
Tse-tung hopes to mobilise the
fear of the smaller nations of
Asia in order to secure a seat
at the United Nations.
“On the credit side of the
whole situation is the growing
unity between India, Pakistan
and Burma in the face of a
common enemy.
“Border-disputes on the
eastern frontier between India
and Pakistan have been settled
in 10 days, after 12 years with-
out agreement. If the Kashmir
issue can be settled in the same
spirit there will be hope for the
Indian sub-continent. General
Ayub Khan [President of
Pakistan] has stated frankly
that this is the only hope of
survival, and public opinion in
India is forcing Mr. Nehru in
this direction.
“Such a settlement would
also answer the internal situa-
tion in Kashmir, where heavy
military-defence expenditure
against Pakistan has led to a
drop in food-production and
rising prices, leading to intense
discontent, which is a splendid
seedbed for Communism.
There is evidence that the Com-
munists have been capitalising
on this discontent.
“Unless unity can be built
between India, Pakistan and
Burma it would appear that
nothing could stop a Com-
munist invasion in five years’
time. Were the Indian sub-
continent to become Com-
munist the whole balance of
power in the world would
change.”
Finally, London “Spectator”
VICKY, IN LONDON “NEW STATESMAN ”
seeks an explanation for what
the Chinese have been doing:
“One is that they were serving
notice on Nehru—in the hope
that he will be frightened off
the fence, and on to their side ;
or at least that he will settle
even more firmly for neutra-
lism, for fear of giving them an
excuse for further aggression.
“It has even been suggested
that the Chinese have a more
subtle plan: to jostle India into
embarking on a vast rearma-
ment programme which would
destroy her economy long
before it produced any effective
results.
“But the most likely explana-
tion is the simplest one: that
China is now in her Stalinist
phase, and is, as a result, hope-
lessly neurotic. So far, this
has done nothing but harm to
her reputation ; and this time
the West is aware —as it was
not fully aware in Stalin’s day
—that aggressiveness abroad
and oppression at home are not
just a sympton of the new
order’s growing pains: they
reflect the development of yet
another ugly tyranny.”
Policy and
Temperament
TAo statesmen always act on
pure considerations of
policy? Or do they sometimes
act on other, less objective,
promptings? London “New
Statesman” columnist “Critic”
wonders:
“Why does General de
Gaulle seem to dislike the
summit so much? Various
reasons have been put for-
ward: the General is anxious
to explode his own A-bomb
first; he wants to have his own
private tete-a-tete with
Khrushchev ; he wants to get a
peace-settlement in Algeria
before plunging into major
international talks.
“All of these are no doubt
convincing explanations. But
lately a French friend, who
knows de Gaulle as well as
anyone can know him, gave me
a different reason.
“De Gaulle, he said, feels
himself psychologically ill-fitted
for the summit type of negoti-
ation. He is fundamentally a
shy man, who is at his best
in a monologue or, if neces-
sary, a dialogue. He favors
bilateral talks with allies and
opponents—hence his anxiety
for a meeting with Khrushchev
—but he dislikes any meeting
attended by four or more
Powers on a level of equality.
“This, of course, involves
having a chairman for each
session, whose permission to
speak must be requested. The


C.S.R. Co.’s Half-yearly Report
Points from General Manager's report to shareholders
In his recently released half-yearly report to shareholders,
Dr. J. Vernon, General Manager of The Colonial Sugar Refining
Company Limited, mentioned:
9 additional services for refined sugar users
9 several new projects
9 record sales of C.S.R. building products
Total Australian raw sugar
production for 1959 is esti-
mated at 1,240,000 tons, with
about 288,000 tons being pro-
duced by C.S.R.’s seven Aus-
tralian raw sugar mills.
Dr. Vernon’s report also
mentions increased demands for
pre-packaged sugar, the forma-
tion of a wholly owned C.S.R.
subsidiary company in New
Zealand, a new “Timbrock”
mill to be erected at Bacchus
Marsh, Victoria, and a rice mill
to be established in Fiji.
Some of the main points of
his report are:
The Company’s
Sugar Activities
Raw Sugar
Australian raw sugar mills:
The Company’s seven Austra-
lian mills are expected to pro-
duce about 288,000 tons of raw
sugar in the 1959 season.
Seasonal conditions in nearly
all C.S.R. mill districts have so
far been good. More raw sugar
could be produced were it not
for International Sugar Agree-
ment restrictions on exports.
Fiji raw sugar mills: The
production from the 1959 crop,
if all cane is harvested, is ex-
pected to reach 282,000 tons of
raw sugar. This production will
greatly exceed Fiji’s total
market level of 194,000 tons of
raw sugar. It will therefore
now be necessary to bring pro-
duction in the next few years
into balance with stocks and
available markets.
Refined Sugar
Australia: Demand for our
retail packs is increasing
steadily. The 2-lb. packet,
which was introduced early this
year, is selling well. The
present 5-lb. packet will soon
be replaced by a 4-lb. one. We
plan to market packaged re-
fined sugar in Victoria and
Queensland early next year,
and later • in South Australia
and Western Australia.
Liquid sugar is now being
sold from each of our Austra-
lian refineries. Many manufac-
turers can reduce costs in their
factories by the use of liquid
sugar.
We are now selling bulk re-
fined sugar in Sydney and Mel-
bourne, and plan to sell it in
Brisbane before the end of this
year.
New Zealand: The Company
has formed a wholly owned
subsidiary in New Zealand, the
New Zealand Sugar Company
Limited, to take over its busi-
ness of manufacturing and dis-
tributing sugar products in New
Zealand.
Building Materials
Building activity is continuing
at a fairly high level throughout
Australia with indications of a
steady increase next year. The
supply of materials to the build-
ing industry presents opportuni-
ties for large-scale manufacture
of new and established materials
which the 'Company is well fitted
to undertake.
Sales: Sales of C.S.R. build-
ing products for the six months
ended 30th September, reached
a new record level 16 % above
that for any previous period.
This excludes the sales of the
Masonite and Bradford Com-
panies.
New Activities: Considerable
expansion of the building mat-
erials division has taken place
during the year and a number
of new projects have been com-
menced. The most important
are:
Masonite: We have now
taken control of Masonite Hold-
ings Ltd., which is being
operated as a separate entity.
This company brings with it a
wide range of special hardboard
products and a valuable techni-
cal link with the Masonite Cor-
poration of U.S.A. The Ray-
mond Terrace factory of this
Company is operating at a
record production level.
Bradford Insulation: We now
own 8.1. Holdings Pty. Ltd. with
its manufacturing and selling
subsidiaries in New South Wales
and Victoria. Our range of in-
sulating materials has thus been
widened by the addition of 8.1.

tion which is made and sold by
the Bradford Companies.
Timbrock: Plans for the
buildings for the new Timbrock
hardboard factory at Bacchus
Marsh, Victoria, have been
approved and all major items of
equipment have been ordered.
This factory should commence
production early in 1961.
Pyneboard: The particle
board factory being erected at
Oberon, N.S.W., by Pyneboard
Pty. Ltd. (60 per cent. C.S.R.)
is progressing well. The build-
ings are erected and plant in-
stallation is about to commence.
Gypsum: Tenders have been
accepted for the construction
of a deep-sea jetty for loading
gypsum at Kangaroo Is., South
Australia.
Plaster: The market for
plaster in Brisbane, which has
so far been supplied from Vic-
toria, is growing steadily, and
to give better service to this
■market we have decided to
establish a small plaster mill in
Brisbane.
Industrial Chemicals
Sales of chemicals by C.S.R.
Chemicals Pty. Ltd. (60 per
cent. C.S.R.—4O per cent. Dis-
tillers Co. Ltd.) showed further
improvement over the past six
months. The increased demand
applied to practically every in-
dividual product and most plants
are operating at high through-
put.
Although volume of turnover
is increasing, rising costs and
easing of import restrictions
appear likely to render future
trading conditions more difficult.
The planning of the factory
for C.S.R.C. —Dow Pty. Ltd.,
to make styrene at Altona in
Victoria, is proceeding satisfac-
torily; a contract has been let
for the building of the plant,
with a target date for com-
pletion by June, 1961.
Other Activities
Rice in Fiji
The Company’s rice milling
and marketing organisation on
the Rewa River is being de-
veloped. The rice mill will be
in operation for the 1960 rice
crop.
Office Buildings
The Company has purchased
Oxford House in Ann Street,
Brisbane, with the object of
erecting eventually, a modern
office building on that site.


General does not like asking
anyone’s permission to speak.
“This explanation suggests
that the best way Macmillan
and Eisenhower can get de
Gaulle to the summit will be
by emphasising the informality
of the proceedings. But then
the General is not a man who
finds informality easy, either!”
Soviet Switches
Tn the course of an article in
“Problems of Communism/’
Adam B. Ulam, Associate
Professor of Government at the
Harvard University’s Russian
Research Centre, notes that
the sometimes baffling shifts of
Soviet foreign policy during the
past few years “are more than
a mere product of the personal
ebullience and rashness of the
First Secretary” (Khrushchev):
“They reflect in the first
place his conscious attempt to
fashion a new image of the
Soviet leader. Stalin in his last
years stood aloof, awesome in
his total isolation from the
people and the party hierarchy
alike, an omniscient exponent
of Marxism and the laws of
history. There is no place for
this type of dictator in the
more industrialised and more
advanced Soviet society of to-
day. The new image of the
dictator is that of a man of
the people, who sacrifices some
dignity for the common touch,
who works through personal
contacts rather than edicts.
“A rather more important
aspect of Khrushchev’s leader-
ship on the domestic and
foreign front concerns his
attempted revival of the role
and vitality of Communist
ideology.
“The main motif of his
‘secret’ speech, just as of his
visit with Tito, Was his seeming
conviction that Communism is
a vital and triumphant creed.
It has no need to conceal its
mistakes, or to hide personal
aberrations. The doctrine and
its future are greater than any
man. And so Communism has
no need for terror and oppres-
sion ; it can provide ideological
links among independent
countries, and it has an appeal
which transcends the mere
military power of the U.S.S.R.
“The same note has been
visible in the incessant visit-
ing in which Khrushchev and
other Soviet leaders have in-
dulged since 1955.
“Their various trips to the
satellites no longer convey the
picture of leaders conferring
with local subordinates or
addressing restricted party
gatherings. Nowadays they act
more like political cam-
paigners : they visit schools,
tour factories and address
public meetings even in
countries like Hungary, where
the majority of their listeners,
with the scars of 1956 still raw,
could hardly feel sympathetic
to Soviet power or Com-
munism.
“The Kremlin leaders seem
impelled toward an effort to
convince the people, perhaps

“WHY WON’T YOU FELLOWS JUST ACCEPT THE
STATUS QUO?”
even themselves, that ideo-
logical links are important and
meaningful and that Com-
munism means more than just
terror and bureaucratic control.
“In this attempted revivifica-
tion of ideology the sphere of
foreign relations plays an in-
creasingly important role. At
the 21st party-congress Khrush-
chev spoke at unusual length
about the problems of transi-
tion from Socialism to Com-
munism. For all his self-confi-
dence and his glowing pictures
of the Communist future, one
can detect perhaps a note of
doubt as to whether the old
concepts and categories hold
much meaning in the indus-
trialised society which is Russia
today. His very reiteration of
the theme that Communism is
approaching, that there are
already ‘signs’ of certain State
functions passing to the people,
sounds at times as if he were
protesting too much and knew
it.
“It is unlikely that all the
speeches of the First Secretary
or all the articles in ‘Voprosy
Filosofi’ would convince any-
body—including Mr. Khrush-
chev himself —that the Soviet
Union was moving toward the
‘withering of the State,’ or
toward the condition of ‘from
everybody according to his
ability to everybody according
to his needs.’
“But if society and even the
party are becoming more
ideologically agnostic, does this
not present a threat, even if a
distant one, to the regime?
This is the dilemma —or to use
a Marxist term, the ‘inherent
contradiction’ —in the new
‘populistic’ type of totalitari-
anism which the regime is try-
ing to construct, one which
was not present in the old
terroristic and ideologically
rigid system of Stalin.
“It is significant that when-
ever the issue has become
critical there has been a lapse
toward Stalinism, as in the
regime’s curbing of the intel-
lectual ferment of 1956 and in
the ejection of the anti-
Khrushchev opposition in the
summer of 1957.
“It becomes clear why
dynamic policy and ideological
expansion abroad are increas-
ingly crucial to the Soviet
domestic situation. The re-
gime’s aim is to provide a
‘proof’ of the correctness and
importance of Marxism-
Leninism, in order to dissipate
the potentially dangerous in-
difference to ideology at home.
“A Soviet citizen might not
see many points of relevance
between the ideology and his
daily life. Tie might even
suspect that an advanced,
industrialised Russia would
continue to produce more
earth-satellites and consumers’
goods whether it was under a
Communist system or not. So
he is subjected to a continuous
barrage of propaganda stress-
ing the importance of the
advance of Communism in the
world at large. The alleged
unity of the ‘camp of Socialism’
is pointed out to him as proof
that only Communism can
guarantee peaceful inter-
national relations.
“Thus foreign successes and
a continued evidence of the
soliditary of the Soviet bloc
are very necessary elements in
domestic politics. This con-
sideration adds to the com-
pulsion for an expansionist
policy abroad, curbed only by
an equal compulsion to avoid
an all-out nuclear war.
“If the Soviet citizen can be
made to believe that ‘all the
roads in our country lead to
Socialism,’ he is less likely to
develop doubts as to where
Socialism at home is leading
him and his society.”

The rate of Australia’s progress has been
receiving a lot of attention lately. The record
certainly is encouraging—productively, investment-
wise, or whichever way we care to look at it.
While the picture has. its lights and shadows,
I think it can be agreed that altogether it is good.
In assessing our advancement, however, I
believe we should start by getting our values right;
and that, to me, means the measurement of our
growth in vital, human terms.
That records have been excelled in many fields
of production in the latest June year, for instance,
is of less ultimate importance to Australia’s future
than the fact that 222.500 children were born in
this country in 1958. It was the highest yearly
figure ever registered, and this was the tenth
consecutive year in which the number of births
had increased.
There are several ways of viewing this stream
which is running in constant refreshment of the
national life. One impersonal, but factual, side to
it is that it will be going to augment our reserves
of youth-power.
We are already assured that, given a
maintained intake in migration. Australia within
ten years should have five in its work-force for
every four there are today. The higher post-war
birth-rate, together with the youth content in family
immigration, it attending to that
This is to be heartily welcomed, with all it
implies in expansion of the economy.
But, granted every material benefit that the
increase in our child population will confer, there
is the infinitely higher consideration of what it
means to the supplementing of our moral and
spiritual forces for the larger tasks ahead.
To the marshalling of that intangible strength,
rather than to statistical tables, we can look for a
true reflection of our progress as a people.
The quality of this nation through the changed
and changing years will be the quality that is
imparted in training to the six hundred children
who will be born in Australia this very day.
problems that cause confusion
and cold war on earth. Antarc-
tica is the test-tube for such
efforts. Therefore it is essential
that agreement be achieved on
how and by whom this barren
region should be governed.”

New York “Herald
Tribu n e” : “The Soviet
announcement of a shift
toward greater emphasis on
consumer-goods is welcome
news for the West as well as
for the Soviet people. Whether
any of the increased consumer-
goods production will be at the
expense of arms is still a moot
point, but in any case it may
bode well for a climate in
which ‘peaceful coexistence'
can be a reality, provided, of
course, more consumer-goods
really materialise. A people
well fed, well clothed and well
housed is a people less easily
led into risky adventures in
foreign conquest.”

London “Spectator” : “Mr.
Gaitskell needs to wean his
party from its dependence on
the trade-unions. The unions
are not, and never will be,
radical. If anything destroyed
Labor’s chances at the election
it was the discovery, made
around the time of Suez and
confirmed later, of how conser-
vative the ordinary rank-and-

This knowledge frightened Mr.
Gaitskell off trying to do a
Midlothian on the electorate.
“Somehow, then, he will have
to set about easing the trade-
unions out of party control;
getting them, perhaps, into a
similar position relative to
the party as the American
unions are to the Democrats.
They may then be induced to
trail along behind a radical
programme, even if they do not
care very much for it. This
will not be easy for Mr. Gaits-
kell (still less for Mr. Bevan) ;
but if he fails he will find that

Shirley Williams, in London
“Sunday Times” : “In some
quarters it has been proposed
that the [U.K.] Labor party
should break its links with the
trade-union movement. I
regard such a proposal as a
counsel of despair. Certainly
the trade-union movement, like
the Labor party, has a great
deal of rethinking to do.
“Above all, its relations with
the general public must be im-
proved. The public, which is
sharply affected by industrial
disputes, deserves to know the
reasons why an official strike
has been called. If that in-
volves spending money on
public-relations the unions
must find the money.
“As for unofficial strikes and
demarcation disputes, there are
indications that the T.U.C.
[Trade Union Congress] now
sees the need to intervene, and
this must be encouraged. A
careful examination of the
structure of trade-unionism in
this country —the role of shop-
stewards, the effectiveness of
the branch-meeting, the method
of electing officers —is overdue.
It would be best undertaken
inside the movement itself.
“But it would be dangerous
to conclude that it would be
for the good of the country if
the relationship between the
trade-union movement and the
Labor party were broken.
Trade-unions in Britain are, on
the whole, honest and respon-
sible organisations ; the same
cannot be said of some of the
most powerful trade-unions in
the United States. Nor is the
history of those Social Demo-
cratic parties on the Continent
that have lost touch with the
bulk of the trade-union move-
ment a happy one.”


member of the South Austra-
lian Parliament who com-
plained that he had not been
properly reported. In those
days there was no Parlia-
mentary “Hansard” staff in
South Australia. By arrange-
ment with the Government, the
debates were fully reported in
turn by journalists employed
on the “Advertiser” and the
“Register.” This member was
a notorious babbler who used
bad grammar, dropped his
“aitches” and wandered afar
into fields —a long way from
the subject—where there were
no semicolons or fullstops.
To teach him a lesson a press-
man on the “Register” decided
to report him verbatim. This
was such an exposure of his
illiteracy that he never com-
plained again.
as were Hughes’s ser-
vices to the Empire and
to his adopted country, I think
that, as the years go on, the
most lasting public memories
of him will be in the realm
of the caricature. He was the
joy of the artists who practised
in that sphere.
The most famous was the
New Zealander, David Low.
His caricature best known in
the Commonwealth was drawn
when Hughes was attending
the Imperial Conference in
London in 1916. Billy was
depicted pounding the deserted
Cabinet table, save for Asquith
and Lloyd George cowering at
the other end with their scared
faces just showing above the
edge and the British Prime
Minister saying to Lloyd
George, “David, talk to him
in Welsh and pacify him.”
It is somewhat remarkable
that Low himself was not
satisfied with the technical side
of this caricature. “Too many
lines,” he said. The original
drawing is now in the Federal
Public Library at Canberra.
Hughes realised that he
would never win a beauty-
contest. I remember the time
when his portrait had been
painted by a distinguished
artist. A departmental head
remarked, “A very good like-
ness, sir. It does you justice.”
Billy quietly retorted, “It's
not justice I want; it’s mercy!”
T don’t think that Hughes
had many really close per-
sonal friends in whom he felt
he could place all his con-
fidence. I was associated with
him in one way and another
over a period of about 50
years, and, while we were
always on the best of terms,
I never felt that I had actually
penetrated the personal barrier.
Few professed to know the
trend of his thoughts on public
questions until he made the
announcement himself. They
were locked in the secret
recesses of his mind.
If you tried, as a pressman,
to get through this mental
barrier, and it did not please
him to encourage you, he

might just give you a charac-
teristic gesture, throw his hands
out, palms upwards, and give
a shrug of his shoulders ; or
he might resort to some other
device, like looking at you
stonily for a moment and then
bursting out laughing.
From all of these, you were
at liberty to draw your own
conclusions. At the same time,
he would lose no opportunity
of dropping a hint which might
lead a pressman to write a
favorable comment to help
along a course that Billy
espoused but had not yet
thought fit to advocate openly.
One day in 1918 Malcolm
Shepherd (then secretary to
the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment) told me that Billy was
wanting a journalist to organise
a Central Publicity Depart-
ment. He said that Billy
thought I would fit the bill.
I knew that Billy was moody
and at times could be very
rude; also that he was very
hard to please and was
sparing with words of praise
or even just appreciation for
those who worked under him.
Often when departmental
heads or callers from outside
the service wanted to see the
Prime Minister they would first
of all find out from Shepherd
what kind of a mood he was
in. If the report were unfavor-
able they would postpone their
call until the mood passed,
unless the matter was of par-
ticular urgency.
One morning when I asked
Shepherd how Billy was, he
replied: “At his worst. He
threw the telephone at me, but
the cord stopped it from reach-
ing its target.”
On Billy’s part, I would say
that few public men had to
contend with the physical ills
with which he was afflicted. In
addition to his deafness, he
suffered recurrent digestion
troubles. I have attended
Parliamentary banquets at
which the most seductive
courses were served. Billy
would sit there at the head
table picking at a few dry
biscuits and sipping a cup of
tea. In fact, tea was his
favorite beverage. During
office hours he drank many
cups of it, and seemed to get
considerable satisfaction from
this indulgence in the domestic
brew which stimulates but does
not inebriate.
With such a constitution,
how he ever gained and main-
tained such a clear-brained
mastery over the big problems
that confront a Prime Minister
was to me an everlasting
wonderment.
TAespite my admiration for
his outstanding abilities
and my deep-rooted sympathy
for him in his afflictions, I felt
that my emotional set-up would
not stand the strain of such
a close relationship as Billy’s
public-relations officer would
have to endure. I explained
this to Shepherd, and he
immediately assured me that
1 need have no fear on that
score.
He told me that Hughes was
about to go to London to
attend a post-war conference,
and that Lloyd Dumas, of the
staff of the Adelaide “Adver-
tiser” (later Sir Lloyd), was
going with him as his private-
secretary and would do all the
•personal publicity work.
Thus assured, I applied for
the position. Moreover, it
would be a great relief to get
a break from the bedlam of
daily-newspaper work. It was
in the professional division,
and the duties were set out by
the Public Service Commis-
sioner in the “Commonwealth
Gazette” as including, “inter
alia, the preparation of matter
for public information arising
out of the activities of the
Prime Minister’s Department
and the Government’s Finan-
cial and Commercial Schemes ;

cuttings and official and other
publications from all parts of

likely to be useful to the'
Government.” This was the
first delineation of the duties
of those officials who are now
known as public - relations
officers.
It offered me more per-
manency as a public servant
than I could hope for in the
newspaper world, and 1 was
pleased when I was informed
that my application had been
successful. Some members of
the Federal service protested
against the appointment of an
outsider, contending that they
could fulfil all the require-
ments set out. They contacted
some anti-Hughes members of
the House of Representatives,
and Billy had to answer a lot
of criticism about “favoritism
to a press-supporter.” How-
ever, nothing .came of the
protest, and I entered upon my
new duties in due course.
Hughes departed for London,
and W. A. Watt became Acting
Prime Minister. I soon found
that, in addition to the other
duties, I was required to draft
speeches for different func-
tions that Ministers had to
attend as the representatives
of the Government, and to
prepare official letters that
needed some measure of
diplomacy. Billy Watt was
easy to work for. He good-
naturedly designated me “the
polite letter-writer who turneth
away wrath.’ 5
I was not so successful with
the speeches. Watt seldom
looked at my notes until he
was on his way to the engage-
ment at which he was to
speak ; it often happened that
he got his cue for his speech
from something said in the
opening remarks of the chair-
man of the gathering, and off
he would go extempore in his
own brilliant fashion.
Watt never forgot to thank
me afterwards for my notes,
and to express something like
regret that the occasion did
not arise in a natural way for
him to use them. Hughes
seldom thanked anybody for
anything.
It was not long after Hughes
left Australia that he and
Dumas had a serious fall-out
on the ship, and the newly-
appointed private- and press-
secretary promptly resigned.
There was nothing that I could
do now but hang on to my
job until the return of Hughes
from London and see how long
1 could stand being his Number
One publicity-man.
At this stage my old friend
Gerald Mussen made a
welcome interruption of my
career as a public servant. He
rang me up one day and asked
me how I was getting on with
my job in the Prime Minister’s
Department. I told him I was
not very happy, and he then
said that he had a proposition
to m&ke.
Our talk led to my later
resignation and my joining him
in the Broken Hill Mining
Companies’ betterment-scheme.
Meantime, Hughes had
returned from London, and
was not inclined to discuss
with pressmen the outcome of
his visit. As they were per-
sistent, Billy used his favorite
expression that they could all
go to the warm place—the
home of lost souls.
One of the enterprising
reporters was J. M. Tremearne,
who had been assigned by the
“Argus” the duty of interview-
ing Hughes on his arrival in
Western Australia. He was at
a loss for a moment, as he felt
his paper would not print the
actual words used by Billy, so
he invented the phrase “You
can go to blithering blazes.”
For years afterwards Hughes
was twitted with this
euphemism, but he only smiled
and never explained. In fact,
he seemed to like the sdund
of “blithering blazes.”
When Hughes arrived in
Melbourne and was told of my
pending resignation, he said
he was surprised at my ingrati-
tude. He had taken me out
of the uncertain newspaper
field and provided me with a
permanent position. He had
had to defend his choice of me
against attacks on him in
Parliament! Now, when I
was in a position to help him,
I had basely deserted!
I expressed my regret, but
explained that I felt that the
opportunity had come to me to
do some really constructive
work towards making Broken
Hill a better place for the
miners and their families, and,
moreover, that it meant a rise
of £4OO a year. Supposing, I
asked, a similar offer had come
to you in such circumstances,
would you have turned it
down?
Billy was forthright and
candid. He did not try to reply
to the case I had put up, but
promptly consigned me also
to that destiny of mankind we
are all trying to dodge. His
anger, however, was short-
lived. He later asked me for
details of the scheme, and
wished me every success in my
new sphere.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Australian Wines
One of the funniest para-
graphs in “D.G.C.’s” really odd
and cocksure letter (B.
28/10/’59) was that in which
he says he concluded 10 years
ago that most Australian sherry
is no more than a rehash of
the blender’s bungling, and
that miscarried ports, muscats,
madeiras, etc., are rehashed by
dilution until some of the sour-
ness and mustiness and incom-
patibility is subdued, and then
labelled as sherry and sold to
the undiscriminating.
If you know, “D.G.C.,” how
you can turn a port, muscat,
madeira (even miscarried ones)
into sherry you know some-
thing that no Australian wine-
maker knows. The fact is,
“D.G.C.,” that it just can’t be
done.
A remarkable claim in
his letter is that Australian
brandy is not in the same street
for price and quality as French
brandy similarly available. (Inci-
dentally, “D.G.C.” describes
all this as friendly criticism!)
French brandy retails at an
average price of more than
£2 10s. a bottle; Australian
brandy at less than £1 a bottle.
As for quality, I think I must
accept the opinion of French
wine-men who have compared
our brandies most favorably
with the French product before
that of “D.G.C.”
We are not one-eyed. The
industry’s experts will admit
that there are a few French
brandies which are outstand-
ing, just as there are a few
French and German wines that
are outstanding. But the
industry claims, and in this it
has the support of overseas
experts, that, by and large, our
wines are the equal of any, and
that the run-of-the-mill wines—
the ones you and I buy over
the counter —are superior to
most Continental wines of the
same class.
“D.G.C.” makes the extra-
ordinary statement that 20
years ago he was buying and
enjoying Australian still and
fortified wines, but has gone
off them these days.
It can only be a matter of
a failing palate, because the
advance our wines have made
in 20 years has been really
amazing. Don’t take my word
“I bet his Captain wouldn't be so free with his permission
if HE had to kiss him!"
for it ; mine could be a biased
opinion, because I am con-
nected with the industry. Ask
the experts. I don’t mean our
own experts. I mean the judges
from overseas.
If “D.G.C.” is right, then
the judges who in three over-
seas exhibitions in recent years
have given gold-medals to
ordinary Australian wines in
competition against the world’s
best offerings must be wrong.

A Six-day Week
The threat of a regulation-
strike appears to have induced
the postal authorities to aban-
don their proposal to introduce
a six-day working-week in
post-offices in the capital cities.
One can understand the
opposition of post-office
workers to a lengthening of
their working-week when it is
accompanied by a cut in their
earnings; but what’s to pre-
vent the department from
reducing the working-week to
five days and rostering a full
staff on six or even seven days
in the week? This would meet
the demand for a shorter work-
ing-week—which is bound to
come anyway—and at the same
time avoid payment of penalty-
rates and give the public better
service.
If shop-awards didn't make
it an offence to open a general-
store on Saturday afternoons,
shopkeepers could give the
public a better spread of shop-
ping-hours by introducing a
five-day working-week spread
over six days.
Just why a person is entitled
to a penalty-rate for working
on a Saturday afternoon when
it’s part of a five-day week is
beyond my comprehension. A
six-day spread of shopping-
hours would benefit everyone
including the transport-authori-
ties, who would carry more
passengers over a longer
spread, thus avoiding the
present payment of penalty-
rates, and overcrowding.
Even a Labor Government
should have the courage to tell
unionists that it intended to
introduce a five-day working-
week for everyone, spread over
six days a week. Those who
profess to be unable to get
along without their Saturday-
afternoon “sport” (which
usually means attending
the races or watching others
play games) would find they
didn’t have to work every
Saturday afternoon ; and even
if they did, they would have
another day off in lieu, making
two clear days off each week,
probably consecutively.—

Canberra Courtesy
“11 Vecchio’s” praise of
Canberra’s buses (B. 4/11/’59)
is well merited ; and I’d like to
add one tourist’s authentic
experience to all he has said.
It was a blazingly hot Satur-
day afternoon last summer
when I left Canberra’s Olym-
pic-pool with three young
children in tow. We had got a
lift down to the pool, but had
to find our own way back to
our hotel by public transport.
. We sat on a seat marked
“Bus Stop” and waited. When
a bus rolled into view up the
road we rose expectantly—
then bleated in dismay as it
turned-off at an intersection
about 300yds. away.
Trained to the ways of
Sydney transport, we simply
sat down again. The bus mean-
while had stopped at the corner,
but surely not for us? It must
have been a full minute before
I realised that the driver was

Flowering Banks
I have just been down to my
bank, where I had to wait a
few minutes to see the manager
because he was watering the
geraniums.
There were geraniums all
over the place—in pots along
the window-sills, in elaborate
wrought-iron stands and on the
counter. I felt that I should
have asked for a packet of
pansy-seeds while I was there,
but my purpose was to get
something else
Along with the plants on the
counter were various prospec-
tuses for all sorts of tantalising
loan-issues offering what, to
my conservative mind, seemed
extraordinarily high interest-
rates.
There were other features of
my visit to this conservatory
which are by the way, but the
two I’ve mentioned brought to
mind two sound old adages.
First, the higher the interest-
rate offered, the greater the
risk; second, that a bank
should not only be sound and
solid but look it as well.
I’m not for one moment
suggesting that our banking-
system is unsound, but the
tizzy set-up of the modern
branch-bank hardly inspires
the feeling of solidity.
Of course this trend is not
confined to banks alone ; all
sorts of businesses go in for
"This lift's too slow ! Get out, Jones — I'll drive the
blasted thing myself!"
it. But other businesses don’t
have to put so much emphasis
on strength and solidity.
About the only places that
haven’t been stricken with this
floral urge seem to be railway
waiting-rooms. They are
soundly conservative in appear-
ance —even if the railways are
losing money—and continue to
suggest that the business in
hand is train-travel. Bare
floorboards, a modicum of soot
and hard wooden benches do,
somehow or other, suggest that
sooner or later a train will
come along—not a float
ornamented with marching
girls and garlands of flowers.
Passing from the premises to
those prospectuses. Old-time
bank-managers generally had
only one suggestion when a
customer asked them what to
do with surplus funds: put
them on fixed deposit with the
bank. They would as soon
have thought of handing the
customer a prospectus for some
other form of investment as of
eating the most indigestible
bad-debt in the bank.
But time marches on, and to
those who knew no other set-
up everything about the modern
bank no doubt appears just as
it should. What I have written
is merely one of the results of
not growing old gracefully.—

Destruction of Trees
Hornsby Shire Council
(Sydney) has asked the State
Government to give local-
government bodies power to
forbid destruction of trees,
even on private property.
Sydney’s North Shore is
justly proud of its tree-lined
roads and streets; and any
landowner there who destroys
all the greenery on his property
when preparing it for building
is regarded as a bad citizen.
It is one thing, however, to
encourage the love of trees and
to teach people to save as many
of them as possible, and quite
another to empower councils to
forbid an owner to fell trees
for what he considers good and
sufficient reasons.
Trees can be a source of
danger as well as of beauty ;
and if councils are to be given
power to forbid destruction of
them they should also be given
power to compel removal of
them when a responsible
officer considers them a danger
to life or property.
Only a few months ago a
man and his wife were killed
when a tree on their property
fell across their house at night;
and every time we have a wild
storm in a thickly populated
area we read of roofs being
destroyed by falling trees or
limbs.
Local-governing bodies are
empowered to safeguard life
and property in various other
ways. Isn’t it time they were
authorised to remove trees
growing too close to houses,
whether the trees are on the
same block as the house or
on an adjoining block? —Dix
(N.S.W.).
Speed Limits
The fining of a doctor in
Lithgow £N.S.W.) for exceed-
ing the speed-limit while on his
way to hospital to give a blood-
transfusion raises the question
whether doctors, as well as the
police, should be free to travel
at any speed they choose with-
out risk of being booked.
One often reads of police
chasing car-thieves at high
speed through thickly popu-
lated areas ; and such chases
sometimes result in fatal acci-
dents, occasionally to innocent
pedestrians. '
I can’t think of any case in
which a policeman is justified
in risking his own life and
those of other people, including
suspected lawbreakers, by
travelling at excessive speed in
crowded areas. Officially, the
head of the Police Department
has explained that policemen
are not obliged to travel at
excessive speeds, even when
chasing suspected car-thieves ;
but no doubt a sense of duty
impels them to do their best to
make an arrest whenever
possible.
However, I have often seen
police motor-cyclists break the
speed-limit when simply going
on duty. Apparently they feel
free to do this since it would
be news indeed if one traffic-
policeman booked another for
speeding.
I. believe that many private
motorists resent this freedom
which the police seem to enjoy.
The police should set an
example in safe driving. It
would have a good influence on
motorists generally.— Peter
Simple (N.S.W.).


done, he had turned and started
lazily to fix the breechband.
“The German” was always
scrubbed clean. She now wore
a ribbon on her forehead.
The commandant couldn’t help
marvelling, although he under-
stood that the thriving of “The
German” had nothing to do
with his threat.
Gorchitza had a rival, also
a convict, who didn’t want
to recognise Lenka’s priority
but preferred getting out of
his way. He summoned up
all his courage, and with an
insolent grin approached the
horse and pushed a cigar under
its nose. He was stabbed to
death with the same knife
which had been taken away
from Gorchitza during a search
the previous day.
When questioned Gorchitza
pleaded guilty: “I can’t forgive
myself for stabbing him.” He
added with a sigh: “I ought
to have strangled him.”
No one felt sorry for the
killed man, but he was a sol-
dier, and Gorchitza was
locked-up. Some time later he
was sentenced to be deported,
He left a message for his
successor to take good care of
“The German,” or else . . .
The threat was superfluous,
“The German” was lucky
again. Her next master was
an old deaf German settler
from the banks of the Volga,
At first he shouted at her, but
he did that only to hide his
growing devotion to the horse,
She in turn was grateful to
him, for he spoke German to
her.
She received more attention
than ever. Often she would
be given a tiny piece of sugar
from passers-by.
Paying for somebody else’s
crimes was a hard 12-hour day.
Besides pulling the water-
barrel there were other jobs,
But she seemed to feel more
at ease now.
The October festivities were
not to be celebrated by every-
body. While their fellow-
countrymen were forced to
participate in the solemnisation
of the revolutionary jubilee, the
Fascists were put in a lock-up
for a few days. An exception
was made of the deaf man,
for the simple reason that “one
can’t live without water,” as
the commandant himself.
admitted,
It was a windless morning,
The squeaking of the sleigh
seemed louder than ever, but
not loud enough to drown the
roaring of the loudspeaker,
The man in charge of the music
was not very anxious to choose
the right records for the pro-
gramme. His concern was not
to have any interruptions to
the flow of music, so he kept
putting on one record after
another, as they came. There
was no need for the usual
vigilance, since all the records
were from the commandant’s
collection. Songs by DuUa-
jewsky were followed by popu-
lar hits, and there were useful
lectures in between.
Old or young, they were all
fed-up with listening to that
kind of entertainment, during
which they were constantly
reminded that “no one knows
a better country,” and that “for
the young all doors are open.”
The camp administration, lack-
ing any sense of humor, could
hardly be accused of deliber-
ately trying to entertain them
in such a sarcastic way.'
Besides, they had all lost their
sense of humor long ago.
A fter the enlightening record
on “why the people ought
to brush their teeth” and the
way it should be done, out of
the loudspeaker roared a
German military march.
The drooping horse stopped
at once and listened.
Because of his deafness the
old man couldn’t understand
the excitement of the horse.
The blind mare was trans-
formed. Gathering all her
strength, she dashed forward
and, neighing triumphantly,
rushed towards the call of her
native land.
A loud rumble and cracking
noise stopped the music.
Everything went quiet.
The ice-covered water-barrel
toppled slowly down a slope,
rocked a little, and stood still.
The water began to leak.
“The German” was lying on
her side, pinned to the shaft,
her hind foot, with a half-
worn-out German horseshoe,
sticking out awkwardly.
The deaf old man went down
on his knees and pressed his
face upon the snow-covered
neck of the dying horse. He
cried soundlessly. They were
his last tears.
ONE AFTERNOON
She came through-the door
On a winter's afternoon; and
the room,
Cold and impersonal before,
Suddenly became warm.
Or perhaps it is I
On a winter’s afternoon, merely
reflecting
A love that I couldn’t buy;
Or merely forgetting
That I have no say
Either on this afternoon or any
other :
In a strange and immutable way
Existing together
But apart to die
Like snowflakes melting in the
street:
A winter’s afternoon, but I
Have warmth in my heart.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
TREES AS A CROP
[From Norman Humphrey]
'T'hroughout history any
-*■ development of settled
forms of agriculture has been
accompanied by destruction of
forests. Axe and fire have
cleared the land for the
plough ; trees have been felled
for fuel and timber, and rang-
ing domestic animals have
hindered the natural regenera-
tion by which forests continu-
ally rejuvenate themselves.
Where such destruction has
continued unchecked, vast
quantities of soil have been
lost by erosion, droughts and
floods have become more fre-
quent and destructive, and,
finally, desert-conditions have
caused the death of what once
was fertile and productive land.
There are many examples of
this process ; for instance, the
Mediterranean countries are
today suffering from massive
deforestation in the past. Here,
however, it will be sufficient to
mention the small but typical
instance of St. Helena.
Australian Graziers can
note with pride their
contribution to the
world record of wool
production for the
1959-60 season. The
wool output is estimated
to be 5460 million lb.
greasy basis, or some
3 per cent, more than
the revised 1958-59 total
of 5306 million lb. The
Australian clip rose
steeply by nearly 100
million lb., and was the
main reason for this
record production.
Increases are also likely
in New Zealand, South
Africa and the United
States.
Noteworthy, also, is the
number of satisfied
graziers who use
Elastrator, the humane
method of Castration
and Tailing. With
Elastrator, there are no
open wounds to harbour
infections, thus lessen-
ing any risk of fly-
strike or setback.
This island is the remains
of an ancient volcano which,
when first discovered, was
covered with forest of unique
type. Within 150 years of its
discovery half the island had
been reduced to barren waste
“Go on, rub noses — he's a Maori chief!”
through the loss of its cover
of trees.
Much of the remainder had
suffered from sheet-erosion ;
but, fortunately, a settled type
of farming for the time pre-
vented the fertile uplands from
further deterioration. One
hundred years ago these farm-
ing-lands presented an attrac-
tive picture of peace and pros-
perity. Fields were bounded
by walls and fodder-trees;
small woodlands and copses
were widely spread ; ornamen-
tal trees and shrubs added
beauty to the homesteads.
When bad times came with
the opening of the Suez Canal
the old evils returned ; 20 years
ago two-thirds of the island
was barren and only about 400
acres of poor forest remained.
Since then much has been
done at great cost to retrieve
the position. The little wood-
lands are once again under
careful management; there are
signs that the streamlets are
flowing with greater regularity,
and gradually some of the
wastelands are being brought
back to production. But much
more money will have to be
spent before agriculture can be
re-established on a firm founda-
tion. (I should add that in
this work of rehabilitation
much use is being made of
various Australian trees, such
as blackwood, grevillea and
some of the eucalypts.)
St. Helena’s story shows how
closely the fortunes of the
farmer are bound-up with the
fate of trees and forests. It
is a matter of vital concern
to him that the great forests
in catchment-areas should be
preserved and well-managed,
and also that trees should play
their part on his own land ;
and here in Australia there
seems no reason why trees
should not be profitably grown
now and for many years to
come.
Admittedly, trees take longer
to bring returns than ordinary
farm-crops do, but this draw-
back is more than offset by
the benefits they bring in other
ways. On steep hillsides trees
are the best safeguards against
erosion. Such areas are gener-
ally best left under their
natural cover ; indeed, natural
forest, provided it includes
commercial species, is usually
better than exotics. It is
adapted to the local climate
and its ground-cover will
ensure high percolation of rain
and the maximum prevention
of erosion.
Trees are as much a crop
as other farm-plants and
respond to appropriate treat-
ment like any other crop.
Broadly speaking, the object
should be to encourage the
growth of the best trees by
removing badly shaped speci-
mens or competing but inferior
kinds. No clear felling should,
as a rule, be done on steep
slopes, and natural regenera-
tion should be allowed to
replace trees that are cut out.
The advice of the local forestry
officer should be sought about
management of such forests in
the conditions of the district.
Where forest or bush has
to be cleared for agriculture,
clearing is often done indis-
criminately. With some pre-
liminary planning it is possible
to decide which areas should
be left permanently under
forest; belts of natural vege-
tation can be left to provide
shade and protection from
wind in the early stages.
The value of shade for live-
stock probably needs no stress-
ing, but many people still fail
to recognise that it is also
desirable to have adequate
windbreaks on the farm. Wind-
erosion is often less spectacular
than that caused by water, but
it can mean serious loss of
soil by direct action, as well
as facilitating erosion by water.
St. Helena provides some
interesting comparisons be-
tween land on the windward
and leeward sides of valleys.
On the leev/ard side ground-
cover may be effectively check-
ing erosion, while to windward
serious gullying often develops
from the combined effects of
wind and lain.
Strong twinds, of course,
batter crops and reduce yields.
Loss of yield is also caused
by excessive evaporation of
soil-moisture brought about
by the wind’s drying effect.
Again, St. Helena offers a good
example. The island has the
unusually high humidity of
90 per cent, for most of the
year and the wind comes in
across vast tracts of ocean.
Yet crops exposed to the wind
quickly dry-out, and the estab-
lishment of windbreaks has
been made more difficult by

the absence of any natural
protection during the trees’
early growth.
Where belts of natural vege-
tation are left, they may be
suitable as permanent wind-
breaks. If this is not the case,
they will at least provide tem-
porary shelter for planted
trees and can be removed when
these are established.
Windbreaks cause some loss
of land for crops, but the
benefits they can confer on the
land they protect greatly out-
weigh this loss. The break
must, however, be fully effec-
tive and must not occupy more
land than is necessary to ensure
this. Some trees, for instance,
send out long lateral roots
and draw on soil-moisture
from far too great an area ;
others tend to lose their lower
limbs and foliage and let the
wind through.
Oddly enough, some trees
can form too dense a break!
The ideal is not a break that
checks the wind entirely, but
rather one that breaks its
force. Gaps, though, should
be avoided, because the wind
will funnel through them and
cause serious damage. Here
again the advice of the local
agricultural- or forestry-
officer should be sought.
Where erosion does not
occur it may be more profit-
able for the farmer to plant
“wood lots” with species of
exotic softwood. Thorough
preparation of the land is
necessary, and planting should
be done at the best time for
the particular district. The
trees must be grown as a crop
on sound forestry lines. They
should yield useful returns
from thinnings at intervals
before the main crop is taken.
Again, ask the advice of the
forestry-officer on the best
species to plant, as well as on
problems of management.
In countries like Australia
and South Africa, where
drought-conditions are com-
mon, fodder-trees can serve as
a famine-reserve. They are
already much used for this
purpose, but there is scope for
wider use, with the trees
regarded as a crop, and there-
fore worthy of care and good
management.
Toxaemic Jaundice
“Pat O'Day”: This disease
can occur even in districts
where graziers rarely have to
worry about unexpected loss
of sheep.
It takes two forms —chronic
copper-poisoning, and helio-
trope-poisoning both non-
infectious but highly fatal. It
is known that “heliotrope”
exists on the rich country of
the Murrumbidgee Flats. One
grazier was so perturbed that
he turned-down the offer of a
highly attractive line of
(apparently) healthy, fat Cor-
riedale ewes (running on extra-
good pasture by the river) be-
cause there was known to be
loss of sheep from nearby
properties.
The disease, first recognised
in 1926, was once classed with
yellow-bighead and certain
other conditions under the
term “yellows.” Investigation
by groups of scientific workers
has led to the adoption or
recommendation of control-
measures, including an even
plane of nutrition and care of
sheep in droving.
Suitable molybdenum-licks
should be placed in covered
troughs, so that the sheep have
free and undisturbed access
both in paddocks and on stock-
reserves where travelling sheep
are “camped.” Molybdenum is
considered a very desirable
supplement to the diet of sheep
and of great value in control-
ling chronic copper-poisoning.
British breeds and their
crosses are mainly affected.
Most susceptible are Romney
Marsh, Border Leicesters,
Southdowns, English Leicesters,
Suffolks and Lincolns. Older
sheep are more susceptible
than the young, and where the
plant heliotrope (Heliotropium

europceum) grows in paddocks
it is noted that the disease
comes-on after the second
season’s grazing. Ryelands,
Dorset Horns and Corriedales
do not seem as susceptible as
the pure British breeds, whilst
Merinos are not very often
affected.
Subterranean - clover and
other plants high in copper-
content can induce a susceptible
state in the liver, and this leads
to copper-poisoning. These
are the symptoms: In chronic
copper-poisoning, liver-damage
occurs suddenly and copper is
liberated into the blood-stream;
the red blood-cells are de-
stroyed, and anaemia, jaundice
and “red-water” occur rapidly.
Acute cases may be sick for
a few hours before they die.
They stagger as they walk, and
the yellow coloring is obvious
on the mucous membrane of
eyelids, mouth and skin. Those
most acutely infected are found
dead, but less acute cases iso-
late themselves and if
approached run a short
distance and then collapse.
There is rapid wasting, and the
flock seems, literally, to “wither
away.”
Hiving Bees
“Buzzer”: If you put a
swarm of bees into a box and
hope for the best, they may
leave almost immediately, or,
if they have no queen, they
may stay a few days building
comb, then fill-up with honey
and away. But they’ll stay if
you give them a frame of brood
at least one-third open and
needing nursing ; and if they
have no queen they’ll produce
a new one.
Although every second frame
need have only a thin strip of
foundation—say, half-an-inch
—to set the bees building in
it, they will make a lot of use-
less drone-cells, whereas on
foundation they make nothing
but worker-cells. Obviously,
it’s false economy to cut the
cost of foundation. It’s better
to divide the hives by splitting
brood and bees into separate
boxes, making sure each box
has a queen-cell and moving
the boxes containing the split
hive a few yards. To leave
one box on the original site
would mean the worker-bees
heading for the old hive, thus
weakening the new one. Of
course, every new box must
have a few frames of honey
as well as brood.
Queensland's Beef
“Myall”: As “Bovine” sug-
gests (B. 12/8/’59), the Queens-
land Government intends to
help the beef-industry by build-
ing feeder-roads through the
south-western Channel Country,
serving cattle-areas along the
western border, as far north as
the Barkly Tableland in the
Northern Territory.
Officials have been investi-
gating existing stock-routes,
yards, water-facilities and
loading-ramps throughout the
area, and the estimated cost of
the scheme —it covers an area
larger than Victoria lies
between £3 million and £4
million; the Queensland
Government will ask the Com-
monwealth for financial aid on
a pound-for-pound basis, but
if this isn’t forthcoming the
State will still do the work.
The feeder-roads will con-
verge on Quilpie in the south-
west, Winton in the middle-
west and Dajarra in the north-
west. The Channel Country,
which stretches from the
N.S.W. and South Australian
borders to within 50 miles of
Dajarra, is valuable natural
pasture and could be a great
fattening-area. Thousands of
cattle are bred on the Barkly
Tableland and drafted to those
pastures for fattening, and an
estimated 60,000' to 70,000 will
be put there this season.
Due to lack of roads some
200,000 cattle, valued at over
£6 million, perished during
the 1958 drought.
Last year 60,000 head were
trucked south to Adelaide.
This diversion will cease when
the road-network is completed.
Motor road-trains, consisting
of a prime-mover and three
trailers, can now shift 80 head
of cattle or 100 head of weaners
a trip, and cover hundreds of
miles in 24 hours, instead of
the six or seven weeks taken
in droving the same distance.
Such trains are now lifting
cattle up to 570 miles —from
Helen’s Springs (Central Aus-
tralia) to Mt. Isa —for railing
to Townsville’s meatworks.
Many thousands more are
carried as much as 250 miles to
railhead. The latest diesel
road-trains, capable of trans-
porting 200 to 250 head a trip,
will soon be lifting cattle and
delivering them with a mini-
mum of wastage. As railway
cattle-trucks carry 18 head,
these road-trains, up to 300 ft.
long, have a carrying-capacity
equal to 14 rail-wagons.
Graziers are putting their
own trains on the road.
Recently an 18-wheel, 58ft.-
long unit (prime-mover and
two trailers) left King Ranch,
Warwick, for Brunette Downs,
on the Barkly Tableland, carry-
ing stud-stock for breeding
The 14,000-mile trip was made
via Roma, Charleville, Blackall,
Longreach, Mt. Isa and Camoo-
weal. With good roads in the
far west, graziers’ road-trains
could transport thousands of
cattle from stations to the
nearest railheads.
On March 31, 1959, Queens-
land’s beef-cattle population
numbered 5,643,428—ab0ut 5
per cent, below the previous
year’s total. The largest de-
crease was in the south-west,
where drought took the
heaviest toll.
The 1958-59 income of the
cattle-industry (including beef,
tallow, hides, etc.) was about
£6O million, compared with
£4l million for the preceding
year. With the completion
of the new road-network
the income could be £5
million to £lO million more.
Over 1,245,000 head - worth
£43 million —were slaughtered,
against 883,000—worth £l7
million —in 1957-58.
From October, 1958, to
May, 1959, 35,000 tons of
boneless beef was exported to
the United States, against only
5000 tons for the same period
of the previous year. Queens-
land was the major exporter.
At least 65,000 tons will be
shipped to the U.S. in the
second half of this year, and
again the bulk will go from
Queensland.
Besides this American
demand for Queensland beef,
a trial shipment for Saudi
Arabia was made in Sep-
tember. If successful, this
could lead to a regular trade-
opening of 3600 head a year.
High beef-prices and low
returns for grain stimulate
interest in fattening cattle by
hand-feeding. Though it was
thought unprofitable in the
past, this method is now con-
sidered much more attractive.
In sugar-areas surplus cane is
being used for fattening.
Besides moving cattle by
rail, motor-train and stock-
route, water-transport is also
coming into favor. For several
years graziers on the Cape
York Peninsula have shipped
their cattle to Cairns by the
motor-barge Wewak; during
the 1958-59 season, 5264 head
were transported. The Wewak
being able to carry only ISO
head a trip, negotiations are
under way for the purchase of
a new vessel, specially built for
the trade, to ship 500 each trip.

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(5/11/’59)
Queensland should have moderate to good rains during
December, but with heavier falls and flooding in the north-
coastal districts and the Peninsula, and in the north-western
and part of the south-western areas. Good wet-season rains
are likely during the first three months of 1960.
N.S.W. should receive moderate to good rains during
December, with heaviest falls in the south-coastal and
southern tablelands areas, and the south-west slopes and in
part of the Riverina. Good general rains should be received
in December, with heavy falls in northern parts of the State.
Moderate to good rains are indicated in Victoria during
December, although rainfall may be light in the Mallee and
Wimmera. Heaviest rains may occur in the east-central and
north-eastern districts. Moderate to good rains may be
received in January and February.
Light patchy rains are likely in most of South Australia
during December, although moderate rain may occur in the
upper and lower north. Rainfall may be patchy in January,
with isolated good falls in the interior.
Rainfall may be poor in Western Australia during
December, with good general rains likely in January.

cattle should be speeded, both
by rail and road, so waste will
be cut and beef will be better.
Taken all-in-all, the outlook
for Queensland beef looks
particularly bright.
Checking Erosion
“Emel”: An eight-arch
stone bridge built in 1900 over
the River Adda in Northern
Italy had the foundations of
its arches protected by loose
stones in bags of wire-netting
to prevent erosion and under-
mining from spates and swift
torrents. Those foundations
are still firm, the weight and
pressure of water having
forced sand and debris among
the bagged stones and packed
them solid.
The lesson of this Italian
bridge has been applied in the
sugar-growing district around
Mackay (Q.) by C. Forzatti,
who learned to build loose-
stone walls in Italy and used
the technique to protect the
canefields of a farmer which
run along Cattle Creek.
To build this wall, sft. wire-
netting was cut into 13ft.
lengths and doubled. The
sides of the bag so formed were
then held Ift. apart by spacer-
wires, and the bag was secured
to a tree or post, filled with
stones of different' sizes and
placed in position with a lean
of 2ft. in 7ft. Succeeding bags,
fixed to each other, gave the
wall the required length.
No particular skill is required
to build these flexible walls,
and if, later, one of the bags
is undermined it will sink into
its cavity and another can be
added on top. The loose
stones pack firmly in all
cavities and become consoli-
dated through the action of
the water, unlike more expen-
sive concreting or stone-
pitching, which would soon be
wrecked by floodwater.
Fire-risks in W.A.
“Gravelsnatcher”: The heavy
October rains in most of the
agricultural areas of W.A. have
saved crops and pastures, but
they have also increased the
fire-risk for the coming
summer. A bad fire - year
follows a good season, not a
dry one, the lush growth pro-
viding plenty of fuel. This
growth has occurred, and there
has also been regrowth on
ploughed breaks.
Breaks, of course, should not
be entirely relied on. They
often hold a fire, and certainly
it’s important to have them,
but they won’t prevent fires,
and there are plenty of districts
where a fire could reach such
proportions that no break a
farmer could construct would
stop it.
For your engine and pump,
use a power-take-off if you
like, but a complete unit is
better, because if your truck or
tractor stalls while you’re fight-
ing a fire you can protect it
with the pump, and if the pump
breaks-down you can drive to
safety and repair it. Driving
over rough country in hot
weather you can easily strike
trouble with your truck-motor,
and if you’re relying on a
p.-t.-o. you could be in a spot.
If you can’t run to a unit on
your own, why not organise
neighbors and buy a com-
munity unit, with each farm
keeping its own knapsack-
spray? The unit could be
stationed on a farm where
someone would probably be in
attendance all the time.
Community effort could be
carried further —in the plan-
ning of fire-breaks or with
clearing-fires, for instance ; or
a whole district could combine
to locate and handle fires
instantly.
Each farm should have a
datum-peg near the homestead,
with a circle round it. marked
in degrees. Anyone at the
house seeing smoke could then
take a bearing and phone it,
with an estimate of the dis-
tance, to a central office, where
there’d be a map showing the
peg of every homestead in the
scheme. Half-a-dozen bearings
from different directions would
pinpoint the fire and give the
district’s firefighting - equip-
ment a chance to go into
action quickly.
Diseases of the Grape
“Ilsinoe”: In the moist con-
ditions of coastal regions grape-
vines are subject to downy-
mildew, while those grown in
the drier climate of the inland
may suffer from powdery-
mildew and anthracnose.
Downy-mildew appears as a
light spotting on the leaves
which may spread over the
whole surface. In dry weather
the spots turn brown, affected
leaves shrivel and a white
mildew develops on the under-
side. Shoots attacked before
the leaves are fully developed
become stunted and contorted.
Berries develop large, oily
blotches with a dark margin
and fall.
The disease is caused by a
fungus which develops inside
affected plants and appears on
the surface to produce spores.
These are blown to fresh leaves,
where they germinate and grow.
In autumn thick-walled spores
form internally; they survive
the winter, and start the infec-
tion in the spring.
Powdery - mildew, which
appears on the surface of leaves
and bunches of fruit, has a
grey appearance and causes
contortion of foliage and
hardening and cracking of
berries. The fungus causing
the disease grows on vine-
surfaces and sends short projec-
tions into the underlying tissues
for nourishment. Like downy-
mildew, the disease is spread
by spores being blown to
unaffected leaves.
Anthracnose can be recog-
nised by the appearance of
black spots on leaves, stems
and fruit. Young tissues of
stems and leaves are infected
and spots grow larger as these
parts expand, while deep
cankers form on the stems.
The berries become spotted and
drop to the ground. Spores of
the parasite causing the trouble
develop on the surface of
lesions and winter in the
cankers.
Vineyard - hygiene will
minimise sources of infection,
particularly if a thorough clean-
up is made during the off-
season. Before bud-burst all
prunings, fallen leaves and
mummied fruit should be
gathered and burnt.
For anthracnose, spray with
6-4-40 Bordeaux at bud-burst
and follow this by a 4-4-40
application when the young
shoots are 6in. long to prevent
downy-mildew. The Bordeaux
forms a film which prevents
entry of spores. New growth
should be sprayed from time to
time as the old coating
weathers-off. In moist districts
spray more frequently than in
drier areas; never spray while
the vines are in flower, but
immediately the young fruit has
set. Cease spraying before the
berries ripen, in order to avoid
residue at the time of market-
ing.
Bordeaux has no effect
against powdery-mildew, which
must be attacked with sulphur.
Colloidal sulphur, at the rate
of l|lb. powder or |pt. liquid
to 40gals. may be mixed with
Bordeaux, so that all three
diseases may be controlled with
one spraying. Powdered
sulphur may also be dusted on
vines in flower without harmful
results. When spraying, -use a
nozzle with a small, round
aperture and high pressure.

author unknown. —6900. /
Copy of The Bulletin Reciter. —
6901.
Two copies of B. 14/12/’55. —
6902.
Information Supplied
From “G.M.M.”: Name of the
poem, Inquirer 6893 (B. 28/10/’59),
is “Lasca,” and the author is F.
Desprez. The lines printed in the
“Service Page” are the last, not
the first, lines. You’ll find it in
Bell’s Standard Elocutionist, pub-
lished by Hodder and Stoughton.
It’s a dramatic number, and was a
great favorite with amateur reciters
about 50 years ago. Lasca is the
name of the heroine in the story.
She was riding with her lover in
Texas down by the Rio Grande
and got caught in the path of a
stampeding herd of maddened
steers. She was killed in trying to
shield her lover with her body.
From “R.M.”: It brings back
memories of a recitation by a
Warrnambool (Vic.) lady in the
Ozone Hotel a few nights before
the outbreak of War I. Anyway,
the lines given in the “Service
Page” are at the end of the poem,
and the second line reads, as I
remember it, “For the things that
are like the things that were: does
half my heart lie buried here in
Texas.”

What is the largest tree in
Australia ?
A mountain-ash in the Styx
Valley, near Maydena (Tas.). Its
height—authenticated by R. Terry,
a Hobart surveyor, in June, 1956 —
is 322 ft. The tree is still intact and
healthy. It is estimated to contain
50,000 super-feet of timber, exclud-
“It’s not radioactive any more!”
ing the branch-top. This would give
about £ 10,000-worth of paper.

What is vermiculite, and where
is it found in Australia ?
The name is applied to a group
of hydrated silicate minerals which,
when heated, exfoliate and open
out into twisting lustrous forma-
tions. It occurs in small amounts
in several parts of Australia, but
up to the mid-1950’s the only deposit
which had been exploited to any
extent was the one at Young River,
W.A. (in 1943 peak production was
363 tons). Production was spas-
modic after World War 11, ceasing
altogether in 1954. In its expanded
form vermiculite is used for
insulating-purposes.

Information on Fulbright
Scholarships ?
The Fulbright scheme, which
provides for the exchange of
scholars and students between the
U.S.A. and certain foreign coun-
tries, was established under an
Act (1946) of the U.S. Congress
sponsored by Senator J. W. Ful-
bright. The section of the agree-
ment which relates to Australia was
signed at Canberra on November
26, 1949; it involves the exchange
of scholars on the financial basis
of a debt of $5,000,000 owed to
the U.S.A. by Australia as a result
of war-time lend-lease and surplus-
property settlements. Not more
than 10 per cent, of the total is
used in any one year. Amount of
the grant made to each scholar is
determined by his professional
standing and by the availability of
funds. Grants are made in all
branches of education for study,
teaching and research,, and include
payments for transportation, tuition,
maintenance and other expenses
incidental to scholastic activity. The
American Secretary of State is
responsible for the general adminis-
tration of the Act. The Board of
Foreign Scholarships is responsible
for the selection of participants,
and works in co-operation with
and is advised by the United States
Education Foundation in Australia,
which has a board of seven mem-
bers on which are both American
and Australian representatives.

MUSIC FOR CHRISTMAS
/Coronet’s latest release of
7in. “Gems from the
Classics” includes four Christ-
mas disks —three choral, one
instrumental. The musical
subject-matter, ranging from
the piccolo brilliance of Bach’s
organ chorale-prelude “Rejoice,
Beloved Christians” to the
triumphant carol “Joy to the
World” (sung with tons of
muscle and suppleness by the
Mormon Tabernacle Choir), is
varied enough to appeal to most
people who like festive music.
The Mormon Tabernacle
Choir (375 voices) is like a huge
dynamo of controlled energy,
able to switch from strength
to quietness as if operated by
electrical contacts. The choir
can be heard singing Beloved
Carols (KGC 153) and Beloved
Hymns (KGC 154).
This word “beloved” inevit-
ably tends to make you sus-
picious, for most of us have
our own special favorites, each
with its particular personal
associations. For instance,
whenever this reviewer hears
“I Saw Three Ships” a picture
springs up in front of him:
Christmas Eve in Sydney’s
Hyde Park ; hundreds on hun-
dreds of twinkling candles, held
by the audience, reflected in the
Pool of Remembrance; and
one’s own voice echoing eerily
through batteries of separated
amplifiers ... but it isn’t one of
the “Beloved Carols.”
Instead there is a tremendous
“Joy to the World,” with all
those voices taut and strong
as bowstrings ; a rolling “Holy
City,” which, although a
dubious bit of musical composi-
tion, grossly semitonal and
punctuated with vamping
organ-chords, here sounds
reasonable enough (but, then,
with 375 voices you can do a
bit of dressing-up of poor
material); and a charming
“Silent Night”—probably the
best-performed carol on this
record, for the music is allowed
to run an easy, simple course
without relying on deliberate
heavy accents. This heavy-
handedness seems to spoil
“What Child is This,” sung
(slightly too fast) to the
tune “Greensleeves.”
The “Beloved Hymns” disk
starts "with an interesting sett-
ing—by Thomas Matthers—of
the 23rd Psalm: a setting fresh
in its modern treatment of
Gregorian ideas. It is an exten-
ded essay in antiphony, with
the voices singing a phrase,
followed by solo statements on
the organ. This is really well
sung, but the organ accompani-
ment is often rather lush
—a curious effect in music that
contains some fine modern
English harmonic elements.
This is followed by a
sugary “Lord’s Prayer” (not,
mercifully, the one which local
singers love to do at weddings);
at any rate, in a couple of spots
there is some rather reedy sing-
ing by the sopranos and—
horrors —a bit of “scooping.”
On the reverse-side there is
“Abide With Me,” as slow and
mournful as ever; a prize-
fighter version of “O God, Our
Help in Ages Past,” with forte
tone and a remarkable bounc-
ing speed maintained through-
out ; and Mozart’s “Jesu, Word
of God Incarnate,” soothingly
sung and glossily accompanied.
For those who prefer a
straight solo rendition of
Christmas-music Father Sydney
Mac Ewan fills Christmas
Carols (KGC 151) with a light,
never-mishandled tenor. The
carols are “Adeste Fideles,”
“Coventry Carol,” “God Rest
You Merry, Gentlemen” (this
one is a little trimmer); and
“O Little Town of Bethlehem.”
Finally, a disk (KGC 152)
titled Rejoice, with a jacket-
picture of golden organ-pipes
which, since the bulk of
virtuoso E. Power Biggs’s
playing is silvery, seem a bit
contradictory. There are
some chorale-preludes—a form
at which Bach excelled.
“Rejoice, Beloved Christians”
expresses, in its brilliant ripp-
ling treble-part, its staccato
bass and its smooth chorale-
melody, colossal and involved
transmutation of the simple to
a rich fragment bursting with
warmth. The next prelude,
“Now Thank We All Our
God,” is basically similar —a
chorale-line with elaborate
decoration —but the decorative
colors here are rich primaries,
not, as in the preceding one,
glassy silvers and greens. The
melody is sandwiched between
thick layers of harmony.
Then, by way of contrast,
there is the “Sonata to Cantata
No. 182, Palm Sunday”—•
solo flute, solo violin, strings
and organ continuo. Short,
restful and sonorously played.
And on the other side you can
marvel at the biting brilliance
of trumpets announcing the
chorale “Awake Thou Wintry
Earth” ; the other instruments
are oboes, flutes, strings, kettle-
drums and an organ sparkling
with baroque tone-colors. With,
the addition of a bassoon, the
same instrumentalists do “Now
Christ Doth End in Triumph,”
from the “Christmas Oratorio.”
The melody so actively embroi-
dered and tossed around is the
familiar “Passion Chorale,”
only in this context it is any-
thing but meditative. The
chorale itself grows, in organ
and oboe colors, out of trumpet
passages underlined by the
strings. Tempo is moderately
fast; and the trumpet part,
which is an independent
recurrent statement, contains
passages to trick any but the
most accomplished players.
This record is an outstanding,
if tiny, treasure-house of
Christmas music, and it would
make a fine gift for anyone
interested in classical music.
Except, maybe, for Beloved
Hymns, which is not specifi-
cally seasonal in temper, the
other two releases should also
make pleasing gifts.

MELBOURNE
In an unusual setting at Fitzroy
Gardens Kiosk, Lord Mayor Bernard
Evans opened an exhibition of bas-
relief murals and a painting-and-
sculpture exhibition. Dorothy Baker,
who did the murals, was present with
her husband and sons Adrian and John.
Exhibitors present at the opening and
buffet-luncheon which followed in-
cluded Ola Cohn, Anne Graham,
Guelda Pike, and Esther Paterson. Com-
mander George Gill, husband of Esther
Paterson, introduced Councillor Evans
to the 180 guests, including the president
of the Melbourne Contemporary
Artists Society (Lady Williams), Mr. Eric
Westbrook (director of the National
Gallery) and Mrs. Westbrook, and Mrs.
George Bell, whose husband was one
of the exhibitors. The exhibition will
be open until January 7.
X}. $ If.
Four-hundred guests had a magnificent
view of Melbourne at a buffet cocktail-
party on the top-floor of the 1.C.1,
building. From one set of windows,
as dusk was falling, guests could see
the blue Dandenongs in the distance;
from another set they looked out to
Macedon, while from windows on the
opposite side of the spacious room
Pori Philip Bay, the white towers of
Government House and the Music Bowl
could be seen. When darkness fell the
scene became a mass of twinkling lights
in different colors. Guests were received
by Mrs. Norman Welsh, chairman of
the women’s group of the Victoria
Society for Crippled Children and Adults
Appeal, for which the function was
organised. Helping Mrs. Welsh were
Sir Clifden Eager (chairman of the
general-appeal committee) and Lady
Eager, her smart black moire taffeta
coat worn over an elegant black frock.
Mrs. Welsh chose a dress of bottle-
green wool-lace woven with a fine gold
thread.
Committee - members present in-
cluded Mrs. Hugh Lavery, Mrs. David
Warford-Mein (in a silk taffeta frock
of haze blue and a small flower cap)
and Mrs. J. D. Phillips, whose choice
was a frock of apricot self-patterned
silk and a smart little cap of grey velvet
leaves, misted with veiling. Among the
guests were Mrs. John McFarlane (her
frock and full-length coat-ensemble was
of white silk patterned in large green
leaves), Sir Albert and Lady Coates,
Sir John Latham, Mr. and Mrs. Angus
Jones (her choice a delphinium-blue
silk-taffeta coat worn over a matching
frock), Mrs. Simon Fraser, Archbishop
and Mrs. J. J. Booth, Sir Frank and
Lady Selleck, Mr. and Mrs. W. K.

The 70 guests who attended the Vic-
toria League’s at-home were amused
when English actress Muriel Pavlow
told them she was petrified because she
had never before given a public talk.
However, despite that, she gave an en-
tertaining talk on “Acting in England.”
Her actor-husband, Derek Farr, also gave
a stimulating talk. This husband-and-
wife team will open at the Comedy
in “The Gazebo” on November 21.
Mrs. Frank May, vice-chairman of the
league, was assisted by the hostesses of
the hospitality committee, Mrs. P.
McCumisky, and Mrs. Walter Levy in
receiving guests, who included Mr. and
Mrs. John Casson, Mr. and Mrs.
Geoffrey Barrett, Dr. and Mrs. Bowen
Allen, Mr. and Mrs. M. Sloman, Dr.

St. John’s Church, Toorak, was the
setting for the marriage of two well-
known journalists, Lynette Walker and
William Howard Brinsley Sheridan.
Lynette is the only child of Mr. W.
Harold Walker, of Toorak, and the late
Mrs. Walker, and for her wedding she
chose a short frock of mother-of-pearl
chiffon. The bodice featured short
sleeves and a softly-draped neckline;
the skirt, short and graceful, was allied
to the bodice with a wide cummerbund.
A band of matching chiffon held her
short off-white tulle veil, and her posy
was of gardenias. Attending the bride
was Mrs. John Nicholls, whose short
frock was of haze-blue guipure-lace,
and in her hair was a curvette of match-
ing feathers. Her small bouquet was
of Ophelia roses. The best-man was the
’groom’s nephew, Donald McColl, of
Warragul. Brinsley is the only son of
the late Mr. and Mrs. Walter B.
Sheridan. After the ceremony a small
family-party was held at the Royal
South Yarra Tennis Club.
At the buffet-dinner party given by
Mr. and Mrs. W. K. Burnside the fine
warm night enabled the 90 guests to
admire the lovely garden of the hosts’
Toorak home. Surrounding the foun-
tain set in the centre of a lush green
lawn were hundreds of colorful stocks,
whose perfume pervaded the whole
garden. In receiving her guests Mrs
Burnside wore a full-skirted short frock
of cinnamon-brown silk-taffeta. The
hostess’s daughter, Mrs. David Raeburn-
Brown, of Broadleaf Park, Rosewood
(N.S.W.), chose a frock of beige
Chantilly-lace, highlighted with a wide
belt and sash of beech-brown satin.
Guests included the recently-arrived
Thai Ambassador, Naj Vadhana
Isarabhakoi, and his wife ; Thai Consul
H. E. Fader and Mrs. Fader ; Trans-
port Minister Sir Arthur Warner and
Lady Warner; the Lord Mayor and
Lady Mayoress, Cr. and Mrs. Bernard

At the Olympic Swimming Stadium
5000 guests saw 18-year-old Karen
Pyers crowned Miss Summer Festival.
The entire pool was covered over with
a dance-floor, on which over 3000 guests
danced, and the stadium itself was trans-
formed with flowers, greenery and huge
clusters of colorful balloons. Guests
entered the stadium under a striped awn-
ing, and in the foyer was a large model
of the Mariposa, made of ice. Karen
has won, as her major prize, a trip to
the U.S.A. and will travel, with her
chaperone, in the Mariposa. The trip
was donated by the Matson Line. The
Summer Festival Quest was organised to
help the Royal Children’s Hospital, and
it raised £44,506. Wearing a formal
gown of white French-crepe patterned in
green flowers, Lady Murdoch, who
is president of the Royal Children’s
Hospital, crowned Karen. In the centre
of the official enclosure there was a
small fountain spraying perfume. The
chairman of the Summer Festival com-
mittee (Cr. A. C. Watson) and Mrs.
Watson, with Mrs. Greenhalf (organiser
of the quest) and her husband, received
the official guests. Premier and Mrs.

Members of the Whernside Junior
Auxiliary cast aside all superstition
when they organised their Voodoo
supper-dance at Butleigh Wootton, Glen-
ferrie. Voodoo-dolls hung from the
chandeliers in the ballroom and on the
stairway was a huge black witch com-


plete with broomstick. Joss-sticks in
large cauldrons were at the entrance, and
on the individual tables were scarlet and
black candles. This auxiliary, which
works for the Royal Melbourne Hospital,
also chose Friday 13 as the night for
their dance. Mrs. William Banks, who
is president of this hard-working
auxiliary, with her husband, Joan Duckett
and Barbara Keogh received the official
guest-of-honor, the auxiliary organiser
of the hospital, Mrs. G. J. W. Leeson,
and Mr. Leeson. Among the dancers
were Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Adams, Mr.
and Mrs. Malcolm Riddle, Mr. and Mrs.
Graeme Fair, Primrose Buchanan, Eliza-
beth Duckett, Janet McLeod, Joy Minni-
ken, Cedric Chisnall, John Walsh and
Barry Scott.
SYDNEY
Christmas decorations are up in many
stores this week. Despite a deep re-
luctance to be caught-up so soon in
the glamor and glitter of a gala-preview,
which tends to overshadow the true sig-
nificance of the season and its celebra-
tion on the real anniversary, one just
has to stop and admire. There are
incredibly lovely angels, in floating
draperies and jewelled halos, seemingly
suspended ’twixt heaven and earth ;
many-pointed stars of immense propor-
tions and dazzle ; massed flowers and
music of carols, and traps for the
beauty-lover and generous giver col-
lected from the Orient and Far East and
just about every other place in the world.
One of the best Christmas-boxes for
the woolgrower and the buyer of
woollen garments comes from a Mel-
bourne firm whose scientists have
evolved a process that really prevents
shrinkage of their garments, even when
put through a washing-machine. At
the exhibition held at David Jones’
those who went along saw this
happen with their own eyes, and
although so far the garments treated
are pullovers, cardigans and the like,
it seems only a matter of time before
babies’ woollies and other small gar-
ments will be given the same treatment.
Miss Nan Saunders, of the Australian
Wool Bureau, and Mr. C. W. Strutt,
chairman of Australian Wool Research
Committee, of Canberra, were at the
party, which was given, by Crestknit Co.

The Great Hall of Sydney University
was the venue of the party given last
week by the Vice-Chancellor, Professor
S. H. Roberts, and Mrs. Roberts, and
attended by more than 700 guests. The
party was held a little earlier this sear,
as the hall will now be in use for
several weeks for exams. (It’s to be
hoped some of the festive atmosphere
remains to brighten the mood!) Mrs.
Roberts looked elegant in a cocktail-
dress of pale-green taffeta and a feather-
trimmed hat as she helped welcome
guests, who included many members of
Consular staffs, the Judiciary and pro-
fessors and their wives. In a sea-
green-silk dress under a cream coat was
Mrs. J. S. Clancy, wife of Mr. Justice
Clancy, Deputy-Chancellor of the
University of N. S. Wales. Miss Doreen
Langley, head of the Women’s College,
was in a charming pure-silk outfit of
brown-and-beige, and Mrs. Bruce Mac-
farlan was eyecatching, as usual, in black
sheath and large black hat. Others
noticed were Mrs. Charles Moses, Miss
Gladys Marks, Professor and Mrs. D.
Peart, Dr. and Mrs. Felix Arnott, Dr.
and Mrs. I. A. Listwan (her jewelled
whimsy in effective contrast with her
black sheath frock of silk), Mrs. Cedric
Swanton and Miss Lucy Swanton, Mr.
and Mrs. Scott Waine, Mrs. Hanne
Fairfax, Sir Douglas Menzies and Mrs.
Gordon Johnstone. The last-named,
whose lovely gown was of champagne
lace, hand-embroidered and full-length,
had news of U.S. Consul and Mrs.
Waring, who are spending holiday-leave
in the U.S., and who reported they were
both “longing to get back to Sydney”!
Vivacious Mrs. Neville Morgan, of
Darling Point, has one predominant
interest since she became honorary pub-
licity-officer for Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital, where her husband, Dr.
Morgan, is an honorary—her first in-
terest now being the raising of money for
the hospital’s funds. She will be helped
in countless ways by its auxiliaries, and
by her large circle of friends, whose
plans include parties in their homes, a
bal masque, moonlight harbor-picnics,
and other attractively-styled functions.
Members of the Black and White
Committee think-up some original means
of raising money for the Royal Blind
Society, and in doing so they give their
supporters some delightful entertain-
ment ; so it was not surprising that a
huge crowd turned-up at the late-after-
noon party and fashion-parade at
George’s Restaurant, Double Bay —
the directors of which generously lent
their premises and provided refresh-
ments both liquid and solid. Special
guests were Rosalia Kuroska and
Frank Bourman, principals of the
Borovansky Ballet. Newly arrived from
the U.S., they officially declared the new
George's open. Rosalia in her bouffant
white organdie frock looked as if she
had just stepped out of “Swan Lake.”
Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere (in a black silk
sheath with elephant-brown accessories),
was assisted by Mrs. Dicky Allan and
Mrs. Evelyn Crossing. Among those who
enjoyed the party and admired the easy
grace of Cha-Cha-Cha exponents June
Baker and Jim Roberts (whose demon-
stration was a highlight of the night),
were Mrs. John Faviell (her daughter
Gaynor helped model the exotic beach-
wear and sports-clothes, and looked quite
stunning in them, too), Mr. and Mrs.
Arthur Gollan, Mrs. Richard Buck-
land, Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Hunter
Kerr, Mrs. Bob Stephen, Mrs. Colin
Ryrie, Mrs. Max Arnott, Mrs. Bruce
Campbell and Mr. Leslie Walford.
Many who attended this party went
on to the Theatre Royal, where the
J.C.W. Shakspearian Company staged
“King Lear” as its final production of
the season. They included Mrs. Frank
McCall Power, of Double Bay, elegant
in slim-fitting black silk taffetas, over
which she draped a pretty white
diamente-studded stole ; and Mrs. M. J.
Fountain and her daughter Adrienne,
who were in a party with Thea Flynn,
Noel Pelly and Robert Meagher. From
the latter came news of the doings of
Riverview Younger Set, whose members
also work hard for causes that mostly
concern children. They plan to hold a
Bar-B-Q on November 29 from 2 p.m.
onwards —it will include some novel
features thought -up by president
Gai McEvoy, Michael Hammond and
other members. Details of location, etc.,
can be had by phoning Gai at BW 4187

Fascinating accounts of her journey-
ings in the Far East came from Mrs.
E. R. Murray, of Southport (Q.), well-
known writer of bush ballads, who called
at The Bulletin on her way to South
Australia to visit her daughter, who is
married to a pilot of the Flying Doctor
Service. Visiting her family entails quite
a lot of travelling for Mrs. Murray. Her
son, Peter, manages the Merino-sheep
property at Ilfracombe (Q.) which was
her home before her husband’s death ;
she has a married daughter in Sydney
and another one in Barcaldine.

back from the war “with a gun in his
hand” to get square with the world or
with his own conscience; and perhaps
it is sufficient to say that Sefton
observes that famous stream the Avon
“piddling” through Christchurch and
that even when he visits a baby it
informs him that “Michael does poos
in his pants.” He drinks, at a rough
computation, 87 gins, rums, whiskies
and beers during the one day of the
novel; he enjoys, or at least recalls,
about 20 love-affairs; he attempts to
commit rape; he is tempted from time
to time to shoot most of the people
in Christchurch; and he views life very
bitterly indeed.
It is a pity that Slatter has fallen
for this formula, for from another
aspect “A Gun in My Hand” is not a
thriller but a sincere novel often of
quite striking merit. What the author
is really trying to do is, simultaneously,
to discuss Ronald Sefton’s personal
problem, which is that he has been a
coward at the war and feels that he
has been responsible, in a moment of
rashness, for the death of his best
friend; to describe the campaign which
the New Zealanders fought in Italy; to
discuss the general problem of the
returned soldier readjusting himself to
civilian life; to display, as Sefton
adjusts himself, the life of contemporary
Christchurch; and finally, by implica-
tion and by a set of reminiscences of
Sefton’s earlier life, to paint a general
picture of New Zealand . . . and all
this, since Sefton has travelled, is to
be set against a world-background.
This is an ambitious /programme;
and in a measure Slatter succeeds in
it. In themselves, as set-pieces, almost
all the scenes are vivid, and some
of the war-time memories are moving.
The descriptions of Christchurch life
—football; the races; the pubs; the
parties—are authentic enough to be
fascinating, even sensational, to New
Zealand readers. The boyhood
reminiscences and the stories of work
on farms and elsewhere give much
of the genuine flavor of New Zealand
life.
But, attached to the inconsistent and
unreal figure of Sefton, the reminis-
cences and the social commentary
have no real relevance in the novel:
they are pasted-on, as it were, to a
scarecrow: and, seen through Sefton’s
eyes, everything is squalid and dis-
torted. If only he had taken a more
convincing figure for his central
character, with a less melodramatic
plot, Slatter might have written a very
good novel indeed. His eye for the
New Zealand scene is as alert as is
his ear for New Zealand slang; his
outlook on both soldiers and civilians
is humane; and he is a much more
cultivated writer than he pretends to
be. As it is, the book is half a social
commentary, half a thriller, and never
moves decisively enough into one
category or the other fully to succeed
in either.
A Graham Greene Play
Graham Greene’s The Complaisant
Lover (Heinemann) is an amusing little
comedy and must have played very
pleasantly with Ralph Richardson in
the principal role of the cuckolded
dentist, but nevertheless it strongly
reinforces one’s conviction that the only
thing to do about sex in England is to
prohibit it.
Here is a middle-aged dentist, fond
of his wife but no longer amorous,
given to amiable little practical jokes
such as seating his guests on cushions
that play “Auld Lang Syne” and
addicted to talking about teeth at the
dinner-table; here is his presumably
handsome wife, fond of him but bored
with his jokes and his teeth; and here
is the snake who keeps an antiquarian
bookshop and likes having love-affairs
with his friends’ wives.
And off go the wife and the lover
to Amsterdam, and, three days later,
into their bedroom bursts the husband,
accompanied by a delightful Dutch
dentist who talks double-Dutch. It is
all set for a French farce, and so is
the ending, when, much to the lover’s
unease, the husband accepts the situa-
tion and the group settles down to a
precarious menage-a-trois.
And, up to a point, a farce or a
comedy it is. But Grahame Greene,
being Anglo-Saxon, cannot resist the
temptation to keep thickening this
pleasant bit of froth into a serious
discussion of the moral and emotional
problems involved in it: and you can-
not properly bring serious discussion
into a play of this kind because in the
first place seriousness isn’t fair in a
comedy—audiences want to be enter-
tained, not embarrassed; and in the
second place the problems do not really
exist here —Mary Rhodes, however
attractively she might be played by a
pretty actress, is a placid, sensible
mother of a family who would never
dream of running off with a lover;
and in the third place, if she did go
off, and no doubt anything is possible,
she would do it here only for clinical
reasons—because her husband is no
longer a husband to her —taking a
lover as she would take medicine, and
that is hardly a subject for discussion
in a comedy, unless on the broadest,
Rabelaisian level.
Grahame Greene is (properly
enough) indignant with the Lord
Chamberlain in a footnote for finding
a solitary adjective and three lines of
dialogue “indecent”; but the truth is,
though there is nothing to censor in it,
the whole play has something of the
dismal atmosphere of a doctor’s
waiting-room. Freud and Lawrence
have combined to persuade the English
writer that a woman takes a lover
only because she is physically dissatis-
fied with her husband, never because
she has a sparkle in her eye.
However, if you don’t take Greene’s
seriousness too seriously, the play is
quite a bit of fun, and very smoothly
handled. If it is extremely unkind to
dentists, in a snobbish sort of way, no
doubt that profession will sooner or
later be able to take an excruciating
revenge for it.
Lord Hewart
Robert Jackson’s biography of Lord
Chief Justice Hewart, The Chief
(Harrap), begins with a conventional
picture of young Gordon Hewart, son
of a well-to-do draper of Bury, Lanca-
shire, on his way up to become
Solicitor-General in Lloyd George’s
Cabinet in late 1916 and Attorney-
General in 1919.
The first sign of the unusual in the
story is the account (evidently a first
full-dress account) of the extraordinary
manipulations that accompanied
Hewart’s elevation to the Lord Chief
Justiceship. The Lord Chief Justice
since 1913. Rufus Isaacs. Lord Reading,
was weary of the office, had grown fond
of diplomacy and wanted the Viceroy-
ship of India. He had also lost a lot
of money on the Stock Exchange.
Lloyd George told Carson, who told
Hewart, that
[Reading] had lived expensively,
and had not made sufficient provi-
sion for the future....he had not
nearly earned his pension as Lord
Chief Justice, and the Viceroyalty
carried no pension. “Now what
do you say to this plan?” asked the
Prime Minister. “Why should he
not go to India for five years, and
we can put in an elderly judge as
stop-gap for that time, and then
Rufus can come back, resume the
Chief Justiceship and earn his
pension! ”
Carson was shocked at this “affront
to the Bench”; but Lloyd George had
more reason than friendship for Read-
ing for putting an obstacle in Hewart’s
path —Hewart was invaluable to Lloyd
George’s Government as an all-round
law-man who had ended all argument
on a private bill with one devastating
speech, who could advise in private
and represent in courts. Still, Hewart
was fortunate in his friends, like Carson
and like Birkenhead, the Chancellor;
and Lloyd George got only part of his
way: Reading became Viceroy; Justice
A. T. Lawrence, as Baron Trevethin,
became Lord Chief Justice, and just


CATHOLIC ACTION
and POLITICS
By TOM TRUMAN
(Senior Lecturer in Political Science, University of Queensland).
This book, by a non-Catholic scholar, is written primarily for the intelligent
non-specialist reader. It gives a great deal of information that is new to non-
Catholics, about the Lay Apostolate which is a movement to convert men not
by the usual proselytising methods but by changing their social environment
through political and other temporal action using specially trained and- organised
bands of laymen.
Compiled almost entirely from Catholic sources, to be accurate and fair, the
book started as an inquiry into Mr. Santamaria’s Catholic Social Movement
which played such an important part in the Industrial Groups, in the Australian
Labor Party split and the creation of the Democratic Labor Party. But the
author’s investigations have taken him beyond the Catholic Social Movement to
other branches of Catholic Action in Australia and their origin in the teaching
of the last two Popes.

GEORGIAN HOUSE, MELBOURNE, 5.C.6
as the Lloyd George coalition Gov-
' ernment was breaking-up, Trevethin
“read of his own resignation in ‘The
Times,’ ” and Hewart became Lord
Chief Justice at the age of 52.
It was not long before Lord Hewart
-made his most famous remark, in
quashing a conviction for dangerous
driving because it had been shown that
a partner in the firm of solicitors
demanding damages for the injured was
a clerk to the Hastings justices. No
one believed that the clerk had acted
improperly, but: —
“A long line of cases,” said
Hewart... ..“shows that it is not
merely of some importance, but it is
of fundamental importance, that
justice should not only be done, but
should manifestly and undoubtedly
be seen to be done.”
Not so well known is the comment
by Hewart’s old friend, Avory, the
hanging-judge:—
Four years later, in one of his
rare jokes from the Bench, Mr.
Justice Avory suggested that the
word “seen” was a misprint for
“seem.”
Lord Hewart could not avoid his own
judgment; in Chapter 10 several cases
of wrong-headedness and a rebuke by
the Bar Council show that even a Lord
Chief Justice can be astonishingly
human:—•
Hewart’s autocratic and irascible
bearing in court was becoming more
and more noticeable by 1928. *His
obstinacy sometimes drove to des-
pair counsel in whose favor he was
about to find ; he could scarcely bear
to have his authority on a legal
point questioned. “Why on earth
did you differ from me yesterday?”
he would greet members of his
Court of Appeal, who had reversed
one of his judgments. The less .
strong-willed judges avoided him, so
as not to be involved in a scene.
Then there was his famous book,
“The New Despotism,” against bureau-
cratic government, which strangely
irritated his former political friends;
and this habit of thought explained the
last great action of his life, his duel
with Sir Claud, later Lord, Schuster,
permanent head of the Lord Chancel-
lor’s Department, over encroachment
on the Lord Chief Justice’s privileges,
which culminated in Hewart’s unex-
pected appearance and fiery speech in
the House of Lords against the Judi-
cature Amendment Bill of 1934,
which had been brought on without
his being consulted, and which would
have conferred a slight on his old
friend Sir Henry Slessor. A com-
promise was agreed-upon, and there
was a sudden rush of upholders of the
bill to shake Hewart’s hand in recon-
ciliation: England’s confidence in the
administration of justice had been
shocked by this quarrel among its
highest administrators, and had to be
restored.
Late in life, on the death of his wife,
Lord Hewart married a New Zealand
girl. A scholar and lover of Horace,
he was evidently a sought-after speaker
at dinners, and a man who could make
any party go. But it is less his private
life than the details of his cases,
liberally and economically scattered
through the book, that make the rest
of the book readable. Some, like the
Rattenbury-Stoner case, have indeed
been done to death; but a great many,
like the curious Maples blackmail case,
or even the prosecution of Marie
Stopes because of “Married Love,” are
new to the present reviewer.

Reviewed Briefly
The Door: Flora Sandstrom
(Barker). Blanche is an unmarried
mother who gives up her baby for
adoption because she can’t afford to
give him a secure home-life. She
recognises him years later when she is
forty and holidaying in the Tyrol with
another English schoolmistress. He is
with his adopted mother, and is
attracted by Blanche and the know-
ledge she displays about art. His real
father was a sculptor. His preference
for her company makes her friend,
Edith, jealous and builds up tension
between Blanche and his adopted
mother. The story is handled with
feeling—though the author tends to
lavish sympathy on Blanche as a bereft
mother and to minimise the mental
suffering of a woman who legally
adopts a baby and lives in constant fear
of having it taken from her.

Call to Istanbul: Constance E. Pad-
wick (Longmans). The hero, Lyman
MacCallum, was bom in Erzerum,
Turkey, to a Canadian missionary
couple; and after Canadian university
studies, a World War I with the
Canadian Engineers, and a little
journalism, he returned to Turkey to
take charge of the American side of
selling the Bible for the Bible
Societies to the Turks, a virtuoso
occupation, his salesmen under con-
stant threat of being waylaid, insulted,
bashed and worse. The last part of
the book is an account of how he
supervised the printing and publication
in 1941 of the new Turkish version of
the Bible which his scholarly father
had completed in 1937. The story of
his life and dealings in Istanbul and
Beirut makes an unusual picture of the
Near East.
